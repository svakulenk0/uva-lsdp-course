Yeah, me too. I mean like again I want I've been want to be on podcast for a while. I listen to a ton of podcast. Yeah, and I haven't been on many. Well, okay. So now that you have your own	1.0
Podcast what do you want to call it? You want to say the name? Yeah, it's take 43 and it's take 43 because well, there's a problem. I'm sorry about the other 42 takes I was freestyle rapping and I dropped like oh like is like a lot of f-bombs and so we couldn't use any of those. It's true. He did you know, and but you know, hopefully one day I'll be able to work out like at least 50% of the f-bombs and it can be our intro song.	1.0
That's like, that's awesome. So what's cool about this podcast is we're good production professionals. We talk about anything in the production world. Video related we've been doing video for 15 years.	1.0
Yeah. I be combined. We probably been doing it for 20. I've been doing it for about 15 old alone.	1.0
Yeah, then what is it for quite a while to exactly and it's important to note though that we are production professionals, but we have a lot of experience but there's still a lot for us to learn.	1.0
Yeah, absolutely. So we were like we want to impart any knowledge we might have on to you guys. But at same time like we want to hear from you we want to learn from you. We're not going to get everything right? We're not we don't want to Hornswoggle anybody and pretend like we are just like these gurus list everything we have to say take it out to the world. You're going to be successful like like we don't know that for sure. We're just a couple of guys. We like doing this we like talking about it. And so we want to hear from you. We want to know what we you know, do right and what we do wrong and and we want to hopefully give you guys some knowledge as well.	1.0
And so I think I think we have a lot of fun along the way totally what kind of comes around goes around and I think that's what this is all about. Just a learning experience and educating both ways. And I think I think we're on the right track for that.	1.0
Yeah, I think so. I mean it's certainly the best intro recorded so far.	1.0
I see that took forever.	0.0
Yeah, but so like let's do it.	1.0
What do you say? Yeah, sounds good. So Aaron, I Start off this this is called this episode is called DNA and it's basically about you and I drew in there and threw an urn. So I want to ask you first Aaron. You know, how did you get started in this and and kind of take me back to that day one where you knew you wanted to do this and kind of give me like a past. Give me like a present. Give me a future as well.	1.0
Oh, yeah, you got it. It's like it's actually super easy for me to pinpoint the moment where I knew I wanted to like put, you know moving images on a screen and that would be in the Summer of 1991 when I went to the theater and saw Terminator 2 Judgment Day. How old were you in? 1990-1991 I would have been I was 13, I guess 13 I guess I was too man. So it was my wife.	1.0
That sounds like a joke, but it's not my man. My man. Yeah. So yeah summer 1991. I mean I had like I grew up watching movies.	1.0
I already loved movies, you know the ones that I watched as a kid over and over again or you know rid of the Lost Ark Goonies like and so in Terminator the Exterminator, which my mother bless her soul. Let me watch as a child. I never scart. I was scarred somebody enriched as well. And so when Terminator 2 like the big SQL is coming out as like I couldn't wait to see it. So I actually went with my parents and sod and the movie blew me away, you know, not just in terms of visuals, but in terms of the storytelling like the story structured in such a different way that I'd never seen before like you want to talk about, you know blowing Minds wide open like that's what happened to me to the point where R. That was when I first like picked up like one of the one of the movies I think there's a movie magazine called Premier that I used to read. And that's when I started picking up that kind of stuff and looking into what actually went on behind the scenes to bring that to everybody and that's when I realized like I think I think I have some stories. I want to tell I like I want to like make something I want to put it on the screen you were enriched and obviously all this beautiful picture you were engulfed in the magazine.	1.0
So what was your plan though?	1.0
Oh, I mean I was 12. I didn't have a plan.	1.0
You were worried. What's what was your dinner?	0.0
Right but but over, you know over the years that followed, you know, I kept on like I said reading magazines about it. And this is like in the, you know, pretty early days of the internet and IMDb had just come out and so it used to be so okay, even before that. I would go to this video store and they had like a big like movie catalog or not catalog but like an encyclopedia and so like, you know, the first person I went looked up with James Cameron because he's who wrote directed Terminator 2 and so I could find out like it wasn't as easy back then to find out who You know what filmmaker like what movies he done like a complete like, you know filmography, but then, you know IMDb came out and and suddenly I was able to like search for this stuff. It was all just like text back then right? I was about to say IMDb wasn't out yet. You nailed it? Yeah. Yeah. That's our reference. Now. That's that is our dictionaries. We like I probably Search IMDb for piece of trivia. I wouldn't be surprised if it's 10 to 15 times a day easily totally easily and I'm definitely when you're watching a movie, right? Absolutely.	1.0
Absolutely like all like I know that guy, where's that guy from about? Oh, is that guy?	1.0
Yea, you know that good made this or who wrote who made this? There's like even just today we're looking for something and and as I was like owner who wrote this is a trailer just came out today. I'm like, I wonder who wrote this for a morbius. Okay. He said yeah, it doesn't look very good. But I was curious who wrote it and I went to it and found out that the writer also did the kings of Egypt so I'm pretty sure my feelings about that movie or Justified. I love that movie but is so dumb anyway, so okay in terms of a plan. Yeah. I didn't have one and immediately but as I got a little bit older and start to realize as I started getting to the age where I needed to have a plan being you know, 17 18 years old. I am I going to college am I what am I doing? I like I had I had come to the decision that I wanted to go to film school. But at the same time like I didn't really feel comfortable like trying to ask my parents to help pay to send me to art school. I'm not it for when I'm not even sure that they would have liked agreed to that. You know, I think my dad's a pretty practical person. You probably have been like like well if you're gonna go to you know School Going to pay for it. We want to make sure it's something we can get a return on the investment for which makes sense. But my parents are also very they've always been very supportive of all the creative things I wanted to do when I was a place to play guitar might like my dad. He'll buy me like this. Nice big Marshall Half Stack and let you know it's always very supportive of this stuff. So that's just conjecture on my part. Is that how he would have felt about it? But good now you need to support especially in a different type of you know, you weren't doing sports and things like that.	1.0
Right right kind of touch on my side of that later. But yeah that's important right it is and so, you know,	1.0
so my dad's answer was join the military never mind about the support.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
Well, I mean he's so my dad was in the Air Force also and you know, I think he was kind of a punk kid kind of like I was and I think it was a lot of good for him and I can feel the same way. I was like, I was like, okay like I could join the military, they'll pay for my college and also like it was kind of like not sure if I was ready for college to be completely honest, like I felt like I needed to kind of go out and like see the world and like screw around a little bit. And you know not it's not a very not very popular. I did like not go to college right after high school, but it is if you join the military, I think it's just weird and I definitely would recommend it for anybody and I definitely would recommend a right now, but but it was it was very good for me. You know, I did I joined the Air Force at 17 and I ended up spending about five years in the military honestly because I knew at the other end of that I'd be able to afford to go to film school. Yeah. Well, thank you for your service. No. Thank you for your service. All right, so did it pay? A off do you after you so you yeah, so in the military then now you're going back to films.	1.0
Are you going to film school?	1.0
Yeah. So yeah. So once I got out of the military I came to Utah my parents live in Utah and it just again not super internet e days and so and I guess I didn't feel very good. It was strange even having been in the military and having gone some of the places that I went, you know, Kuwait and strange places. I still had kind of a problem feeling like I could just go like to LA. And live by myself and go to college they're like, I didn't feel comfortable with that partially because I was married at the time and I know for me I would've been fine being broke sleeping in a gutter going to college in LA, but I was married and so I had somebody else I needed to take into consideration. And so I felt like I couldn't like drag her along to do the same sort of thing. And so the kind of the compromise I think was moving to Utah to Salt Lake where my parents lived and go into the University of Utah has actually had from all from everything. I'd heard a pretty decent little film program moving from Idaho, right? No, so I was in England. Oh God. Yeah. So yeah grew up in Idaho. But then when doing military like left, Idaho and never looked back and and so I was yeah, I was stationed in England for most of the time I was in the in the Air Force and so it's moving back from England back to Utah which I like I did take the short route from Idaho to Utah for sure anyway, but yeah, it kind of took the long way around and so yeah, like I decided I'm like I'm gonna go to film school and you know, like I think Film school is definitely a conversation that could be had another day. Is it worth it? You know, there's a lot there's been a lot of talk about that like, you know, sometimes people say the best film school is just you know doing it, you know, and like I actually don't disagree with that especially in today's world. Yeah, especially today's world is when there's so much online you can read about like there's basically just textbooks online you could you have access to like every movie ever made like you can do a bit of self film school and like equipment like honestly, you know phones, you know, you can grab a phone. It's got a camera on it you can Start you can start doing stuff much easier than you could back when I started in school. There's more content and filmmaking today than there has been ever ever actually seen as such a crowded like this is the stuff I want to do stuff as a kid and like part of me wishes. I was born about 20 years later so I could really taken advantage of all this like at a younger age sure.	1.0
We still can but you had some again though, you had to learn kind of the Grassroots and kind of the the harder way. Maybe if you will. Yeah for sure. I don't think there's an easy way but no and I think there's also not one right way to do it true and it because it depends on	1.0
And the particular person what works for how you know how I learn is different from maybe how you learn, you know, maybe a classroom setting works better for me. I'm not sure if that's true. But like maybe it does it just depends like and I think again, this is a conversation. I think we could probably do a whole episode on I think Film School versus not filming. We should I think we should too like I found it helpful for me for the most part, but what I didn't learn I learned a lot about story if anything the four years was worth the screenwriting class that I took an incredible teacher named Paul Larsen. And who the guy just the best thing about him? He taught me the one rule of screenwriting like screenwriting doesn't really have rules. There's one rule and of keep it interesting. Yeah, whatever it takes to make that happen. Well, we've that we've made not to jump ahead but we've made three short films together and I think that shows right? Yeah, I think so. I think that's it everything. I feel like I should have like tattooed on my butt or on your butt or is that you know what I mean, like like or on like a written on a wall would probably make a lot more sense or just an arm or just two dozen armed. Yeah or tattooed on my eyeball. It just like I think it's probably the best piece of writing advice I've ever heard and I've heard a lot of writing advice everybody has writing advice but if keep it interesting if you remember that and you look what you're doing, like is this interesting and even if it's just interesting to you, you know, that's that's a start as long as it's interesting in some way shape or form that was kind of the past.	1.0
Let's let's kind of talk about present for you now.	1.0
Yeah, so I mean, I guess I could start it like the beginning of the present which was like actually having a career in video production and the first real job I got I was still in college when I got it was is hired by a company to do wedding videos and Ari. Yeah, I think anybody that's gone very far in the video production field has probably done wedding videos at one point or another great starting point.	1.0
It's a good thing. I'm sorry. It's kind of a joke, but like but it's rough anybody that's really done. It really done that that wedding video Hustle nose and like live it's like shooting like it is the great screwed up the bride and groom kiss, you know, you can't cut you can't have you ever screwed up a wedding video. I have I have not I	1.0
Screw up someone wedding, which was a buddy of mine that I shot his wedding Indianapolis.	0.0
It was probably was the second-to-last what and I've shot and I accidentally deleted the mic audio but I had backup audio. I think I just didn't sound as good but I was able to make it work and they couldn't tell but owe you my heart sank.	0.0
The yeah. Anybody does be a production like has had that feeling it's probably another I had shot a wedding and it was the ceremony part of it and shooting on Mini DV back then I think I was on like an Excel like a cannon Excel to sick, right so At the time Blake by far this is the far the coolest and read every child. That was very by far and the I don't know what happened. But the tape was just trashed like I'd put it into like the other capture at real-time weird. Yeah, you gotta play it on TV. You have to walk away. Yeah as it's going through the acts like if it's an hour of Tapley, you have to wait for an hour for to go into the computer. Yeah and like you want to talk about I do not miss that. Oh boy me neither man. So the I mean the biggest sinking feeling in the world is realizing have to Talk to the client and say hey, I lost your wedding. Sorry luckily in this case in this particular case. I was very lucky and and they were actually very very cool. And I think we saw I think we had a second camera but in no audio is like we could see it was sort of Salvage but like not really kind of my me so, okay. So anyway, so after after doing wedding videos, I'll speed this up because actually we are cruising on time the first three minutes of this was was us trying to record. Oh, that's a good point. That's a good point at least three minutes maybe I'm more than that good. Yeah, the first 42 takes so this interesting keep talking to me. So don't mind if I do it's a podcast it probably makes sense.	1.0
If I do my man my man.	1.0
So yeah when I left winning videos, I went the route of and I'm so I'll just bring up a little bit of a difference in injure and I I have a tendency to stick more with like corporate Jobs versus being a freelancer Drew. You're you're more of a freelance sort of individual. Well, I've been able to	1.0
I've gotten I shouldn't say I'm lucky because I say that quite a bit but I've worked hard to get to you work hard you work hard again.	1.0
It doesn't stuff like that doesn't just happen to people and don't get me wrong.	0.0
I mean, it's been a rough. It's been a wild ride. You know, I've gone through some corporate gigs, and I've done that whole thing and it just doesn't work out and I find my best creativity. I can Implement my best creativity when I'm on my own and I'm My Own Boss. I've been that way since day one and we'll get into it when I talk about kind of how I started.	0.0
So yeah, so I started a job as a editor for one of the local TV station to CBS affiliate here in sorry. No the ABC affiliate here in Salt Lake and I went to the CBS affiliate here in Salt Lake won an Emmy was some of the with a piece that I did that at some point. I'll put a link out there. So you guys can all see it and at that point I realized I'm like, you know, what I've had enough of news could probably actually also do an entire episode on what it's like working in local TV station. I think we could probably we could probably find a really good guest to come on to talk about any cool. All sorts of people, that'd be interesting. That would be a good one news is a particularly rough filled and so once I had made a five-year plan at that point to once I was in news, I'm like, okay, I'm new to this and it is I'm going to get an Emmy. I'm going to get out and because I knew that Amy could help give me other jobs and it has which it has which was the next job which is doing video production for a marketing company, which is actually where Drew and I met I still work there currently do some freelance as well on the side and thinking about what does the future look like for me? Right? Very cool.	1.0
And then yeah when I Stopped working there. I just kind of continued into freelance world. Yeah, so that's that's interesting man.	1.0
Oh, thanks man, but I want to hear about you. Like I know most things about you but I feel like there's some stuff like they're in your backstory that yeah find out about and I'm kind of excited about it.	1.0
Well, I remember I always say I had this like whole other life before we met I think sorta yeah, it's crazy. Yeah. So the snowboard world that's kind of where we think shaped up, right? So at a young age my grandpa worked for RCA, he actually built TVs and then he also built camcorders, which is really cool. Okay, that's awesome. So he yeah the one I have tattooed on my arm. Is it one he billed as a keystone, but that's the one he filled my Mom's birth with.	1.0
Wow. She's really cool. Yeah, that's it. You actually have that camera, right? I do. Yeah, that's so cool.	1.0
Yeah, so I do have that Cameron my office but it's cool because so my grandpa always had these really cool RCA like cat, you know Tech and quote or air quotes at the time this was you know, early 90s and he would always fill my brother and I doing like riding bikes and doing these karate shows and magic show that karate shit is a sick. I want to see one of those now you don't and so bad so It was really cool because you know, he would set the camera down and then guess who gets to play with it me true. So yeah, so I was like, I always saw him with a camera and I looked up to him so much man. Like you have no idea how much I looked up to him and he kind of kind of did was that father figure for me for a while and he passed away and no one but anyways besides that he was just he was a very much an influence on my life. So I knew that he was he was successful and and his career in his field. So I kind of saw that and kind of took the leap forward as well.	1.0
How old do you think you were? Do you know how old you are? You've like first picked up the camera probably six or seven. Yeah. Yes. I was about the same age my aunt and uncle had like a think is like an old Panasonic least HS camcorder and I was probably, you know, actually probably a little bit as closer to about 10. Yeah.	1.0
No the first first camera every shot with it's amazing like and now to see the technology and how it night we write but it was cool because he would always have these and it wasn't much to him for me to take it around. It wasn't like. Oh we just bought that you know it so I just brought that home from work, you know what I mean? So right and it was it was really cool. So I moved in to that he passed away. No. One and and I was really in the snowboard. I still am in the snowboard. I said a word all the time and we had this local little Hill in Indiana where I grew up and my uncle worked there and I was able to always take cameras and these were different cameras at the time. So now we're talking like late 2000s mid-2000 like Sony Handycam exactly TV Sony handycams. I had I had the first Sony Handycam that was the HD 1080p model, but that was kind of like senior year of high school. I don't want to jump too far ahead. But dude, I was the typical. Later kid with a camera, you know, we've all heard that story. You know, I filmed my brother. We filmed each other skating we film snowboarding, but it was cool because I manage the terrain park at this local Hill. I don't call it of ski resort. It was a hill, but we had a kick-ass Park man. It was really cool like we there was huge jumps for how small this place was. We built we would go in and Weld and paint the rails in the summer. So then we would beat they'd be all new for the winter time. But what was cool as we had this part crew and they were all the best Riders from kind of around, Indiana in Northern, Kentucky. Leave it or not. Yeah, there's Northern Kentucky snowboarders.	0.0
And you know the yeah as somebody who's never really been to like the Midwest or south at all like yeah, like the thought of that does kind of surprised me a little bit. Yeah, especially being from Utah now, we have the best snow on Earth that would like the enormous mountains looks like look outside. Yeah, they're right there.	1.0
We're ten minutes away from Brighton Solitude Snowbird and and Ulta, you know, we're not have which I take advantage of know you don't but what's cool as is I would film these guys and they film me and we all because we had a photographer. The crew to and we would we would film each other all the time snowboard and doing all these cool tricks and all this stuff and I would make a DVD at the end of the year and then the next the following year. I edit during the summer and the following year. We have an open house and I would actually Premier the the movie that's so cool van. That's really cool with sell these DVDs out of the back of my car van ten bucks a pop. I walked away one time with $200. I knew at that point you could make money from this. I knew at that point. I was like, you know, you don't have to take that easy route you can An actually do something for yourself and I think that's why I'm always in the freelance mindset. Right and I'd you know, you can make money from this just by doing something yourself.	1.0
How cool is that that both of us get to do for money something that we love doing. It's like like I bet if you pull people like I would be surprised if 50% of people were doing on a daily basis what they love doing and I know that we're lucky we are lucky and I say that our yeah, we are those who say comes with it comes with being smart though, right?	1.0
Because it won't work luck. Only last you so long. You can only hit you can only hit black on roulette for so long until you hit red right? Nice analogy, bro. Thanks, bro. I just went to Vegas last week. I was there you just need to be real know that you know, but I so it was cool though. After that. I and I started going to college I went to school at IU. I didn't move too far away. I owe you that Indiana University and we that was the Campus based on of Bloomington. They had a telecommunications program there. So when I was there, I guess I started in between going to college and high school, but I actually started working with the local photographer. He Is the best in Indiana he still is is Kevin Hudson Hudson photography. He's absolutely amazing, but he taught me a lot of really cool lighting techniques because I was the guy moving his lights around we were using old strobes and things like that and he's cool. Yeah. I think he had like he was using the 5D. I think the time Mark to you know, Mark to Angela. I still have a 5D Mark II. Honestly, it might be a Mark 1 now that I'm talking about it so so in I know he has the 3 and the 4 now, but at the time though, I mean he had the best camera. I would shoot little promo videos for him with my camera. He he really liked the video aspect because he was Leave at ography right and studio photography.	0.0
Okay, as soon as yeah, what kind of so like model photography lots of model photography, which was cool.	1.0
But a lot of like senior portraits and family and at the time that's the best that's as good as it got for me because I'm again. This is a small town. This is a small-town Southern Indiana and this guy was teaching me all the stuff that he had learned for 20 years. So I'm taking this and I'm trying to implement this as much as I can on set while with him, but at the same time I'm in a telecommunications program at IU and I'm not I don't feel like I'm learning. Earning anything right now and taking it's a university. So I'm taking these hard math classes finite math and you'll later once I got going in into college kind of my Junior and Senior year. That's when the fun classes started to pick up. So we had like production classes script writing classes script writing like I have kind of a tiff with because my screenwriting teacher unlike yours was actually really rude and yeah, it's a bummer so I kind of have this like little itch, you know with with screenwriting but I'm still working on it.	0.0
Well, it's amazing. It's amazing like just saying that like The Who If you'd had a screen reader to that, you liked who you might be doing more of that if I discourage Any teacher I didn't like maybe I wouldn't be doing it. That's true. It's teachers just shape so much about you. We don't even realize you're right.	1.0
So I graduated from IU at the film degree telecommunications The Bachelor of Arts and Sciences, which means nothing to me. It's set in enough folder right and a box here.	1.0
So we will have these degrees that were bet would be better place mats. Yeah for the most part.	1.0
No, yeah expensive placement, but I would I would eat on it, but I I feel like you have is there like chili stains and Only chilly note for me. Oh, yeah, so so no I so I got this degree and and I you know, and I part of me feels like it was worth it. You know, I don't feel like I learned a ton of production in school, but the experience which I'm still paying for the experience itself was all worth it how to live on your own how to meet people. I met my wife there at school in class like the old school way, which is awesome. Thank you. So I thought at that point, you know, Mike Was to move out here and I was still sponsored in snowboarding. I was writing for a couple different companies. So I'm just going to move out here and figure it out. I don't have a job when I'm moving out here. So my girlfriend the time now my wife we packed up my car. We drove all the way across the United States. Tell Tom how long of a drive is that too long? It was a knife. I think if you do it straight, it's like 26 hours I good.	1.0
Yeah, it's pretty that's a long time.	1.0
It's ER it's pretty far but we were able to split it up under like three or four nights and we just kind of we like visiting these little museums and the bread make a nigga was fun out of it was and the car that I had like a Scion at the time. I'm and like that thing was just wheelie and all the way on wait a minute. Yeah, did we know that we both had Saiyans at one point? What was it? I had a Scion tC. Yeah, he's black TC. I had a black XP. That's why I don't think I don't think we've ever talked about this. I don't think we have we'll do a whole episode on silent. They don't even make them anymore. Mine was basically a Pepsi can on Wheels is what I kind of thought of it was a hollow a scar Paolo. I liked that. It was a hollow car basically, so now he was cool. So at the time, you know, I moved out Here I didn't have a plan on the way out. I did apply for a job at Backcountry.com and a lot of my friends at the time work there as well. And I was thinking, you know, I'll just apply and I'll work in the call center. You know, right? I'll talk gear. I know gear I ride for companies. This is great yadda. And on the drive out. I actually about six hours away. I got a call and I got the job. He does awesome. So that was really cool. And at the time a job was a job. I was just going to snowboard and I always had film and you know video to you. No lie back on it in case something didn't work out. Which was really really cool. So I don't feel like in school. I learned as much as I could have. Yeah, but I knew once I started going in the right field and working for people that I could keep developing those skills, right? So what was really cool about Backcountry as is I was there for two months and I get an email about job openings via email like internal and one of the jobs was for video and I'm like, okay, they're building out a new video program. This is great. This is this is a big opportunity for me. I apply instantly boom. I don't hear back for a month I hit. Back, I'm like, there's no way I got this but it's worth.	1.0
Can I checking up on you know, yeah, that's like that country. Take the kind of taking their time a little bit. Seriously. Yeah. Yeah and I come to find out ya get it got worse for sure.	0.0
But I got the job. That's awesome. So yeah, they built out a whole new studio me and three other guys got hired. We were shooting products. We shot commercials for we shot with athletes. We shot, you know commercials for the North Face. What a great start. It was insane. Yeah. I was I now that's when you talk about luck. That's when I felt lucky and I still disagree though.	1.0
I mean, I feel like there's probably a reason they hired you. Something about you. They're like that's kind of the quality we're looking for.	1.0
Yeah, and I was think about it.	1.0
I was twenty three or four I'm 30. Now.	1.0
I was twenty three or four and I was the youngest one on the team the other guys they were hiring were 35, you know, and I was able to move around and they knew I could snowboard so I was able to go out on the slopes and go fast with gimbals and right Gimbels at the time. Yeah.	1.0
Well I see and that's it. Such a definite skill. Like that's something I could not do right like I don't ski or snowboard you put me on a snowboard with a camera. I'm going to end up like writing the	1.0
Down the hill shot, maybe not but no it was just I did I kind of felt lucky but what was really cool is there was a couple people there that and I still in contact with one, you know, Peter O'Brien. He was really tally shot for a Nitro Circus and he had a lot of cool background and I kind of got under his wing and he was just able to teach me a ton about what we were going to do and the plan I learned about pre-production. I learned it all the things I didn't learn in college. I was able to learn that first job. I got to work one day. Day, they can have the video team are the candle the video team. They were getting rid of product videos. They were going to Outsource. The marketing team wasn't doing well. We were done so cool.	1.0
That's my first my first head on the chopping block, you know, I mean again working video production were corporate job. You're going to go through layoffs you want for some reason a lot of people seem to think videos one of the most Expendable parts of a come it is and it's not but is it they think it is right. So that's just the video is expensive to produce it is so a lot of companies look at that a lot of overhead and like that's one of the first things that we're going to cut totally and	1.0
Dude, that's the first head on The Chopping Block. Right? Each layoffs was painful. So I did some freelance in the middle there with some with you know, snowboarding companies at the time because that was kind of my only connection at the time, right? So I was able to do some freelance work and then I decided, you know, I need to get more into the industry. So I started working at this really cool place downtown called Redmond movies and stories. It's a Hollywood production rental house. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah, we've got the rats remixed the audio for my last movie exactly.	1.0
But yeah, and they had a really cool Studio great opportunities there with meeting people. People I had people coming in all the time. That was the first time I got to work on like a large set. I work with like Danny Trejo and I got to get my hands on expensive Hollywood equipment. I think, you know the guys I met there that have been there for a long time in the grip house. They did like Dumb and Dumber and Matilda and The Sandlot all these really cool movies and it was just it was fun to like set around the lunch table and listen to these stories from these grips, you know, and totally and awesome. Yeah again mentoring right so I didn't still think in the back of my head. I didn't learn a lot in college, but now I'm still learning right I was able to take the knowledge from that country. And Redman and apply it to forward I was able to apply forward and keep pushing forward. So I walk in and getting one day get this I'm there for maybe eight months and a show canceled from show time that we were doing a lot of work on remember the show was yes blood and oil. So we were we had just invested I say we but the owner had just invested a lot of money into these huge Airy lights like Sky panel not Sky panels the way bigger than that. They're like do their you could like fit inside of them. They're the biggest Lights I've ever seen they create they create like Son basic, right and he bought three of them and I guess the invested all his money into those. They're still doing great right now. Redmond is basically long story short. That was they didn't have money to pay us anymore. So guess what head on the chopping block number to yank?	1.0
Yeah. So okay.	1.0
This isn't working. I'm thinking but again I'm able to apply that knowledge that I'm learning those stories from people. I'm kind of starting to know more people in the industry and then I do freelance for probably two years things get a little bit slow and that's when I A call from Dave attics participating Dave mopper. That's what and that's and I actually met Dave at Redmond.	0.0
I yeah, yeah, they've used to Davies to do a lot of work with red menu has a lot of people over there.	1.0
There was a it was a co-op in one of the sides and they had their own Production Studio over there. So he was a website designer and we were working on building a new website for Redmond and I was going to film some of the motion clips for it. Okay, that's where I met Dave and Dave actually called me and he asked me to come in and chat about it with this open video position. He basically had he was hiring too. Ooh people his goal was to kind of do like a Red Bull media Style Network because you guys work with some amazing Brands over there.	1.0
Yeah, we do. We have done some jobs work with Reebok with the North Face OtterBox like yeah, lots of large Brands and by the way, just to just to throw us in here just so everybody has context for who Dave is Dave ma pert is a very close personal friend of both of ours. But before that he was my boss. He hired me. So at this company, I'll just go into the name is expert boys. I he hired me. An editor there and after about a year or so that's when he made the call to Drew to come in to start expanding our video team, right?	1.0
And at the time I only knew Dave right? I didn't know you I didn't know Zack. I didn't know any of the other team members. So that was really cool. So I came in I talked with him, you know, he told me his plan and I got hired as a videographer and then that's when I met you and you were doing all the editing I little remember the first day you started and it was we what we walked up to Harmons to get some lunch is already there's six of us at the time and it was	0.0
it was immediate you and I paired off and talked the entire way up there and I'm pretty sure like, I know I do this is very bromante. But like I Knew by the time we got to Harmons which is like three blocks away. I'm like like this guy's cool. We're gonna have like for sure.	1.0
Well that might go, you know, you kind of go into these these corporate positions and he's you know, this uniform style. I shouldn't say like physical uniform but right now this is a certain decorum. Yeah. Yeah and you I got I get a little nervous because you know, and I'm you know slightly I have a hard time trusting these types of that atmosphere should be With good reason yes Oven stuff you've been through but I agree man. I we walked down and we got some lunch and and I was like, yeah, this guy's cool. And you told me you had an Emmy and I was like, this guy's really freaking cool.	0.0
I knew the Army would come in handy.	1.0
Yeah making friends with the Enemy exactly. So so we worked there for a while. We did a lot of cool shoots. We work with a lot of Brands like Vega did area which is like Evans and Martin and promark.	1.0
Although that was probably one of my favorite videos that we ever did there was cool did today we work with we work with KTM.	1.0
We did North Face again we can Stephen we traveled to Canada.	1.0
We did I mean we Florida or I mean several times down to like Moab. Oh, yeah, lots of my trips where I mean, we're lucky. We do have a lot of outdoor Brands and so luckily. I have a lot of Outdoors right near us. Yeah, and so we can shoot a lot right around here.	1.0
Yeah, but going back to learning. I mean you talk about I mean not only did I learn a lot at that place Dave is one of the most excellent mentors in the world and he is incredible. He is incredible and not only did he help me kind of funnel all of those thoughts and and all of those positions That I've done in the past where I've been editing producing, you know, directing all this crap. I shouldn't say oh crap, you know all these Crepes fine. I'm fine with grab it but I you know all these positions where I was producing directing and editing and running the camera. He helped funnel down, you know your egos Drew. You're a DP he goes, you're so good at lighting. Thank you. Kevin Hudson. You're so good at lighting and you're so good at shooting and I'm like at the time I'm like, yeah. I know. I know dude, whatever like it's fine.	1.0
Yeah. I think I pointed. Well, yeah, I pointed at you. I say a speed, you know what I mean?	1.0
So and but then we started looking back and he started showing me old footage and he helped me believe that I was that which I really think helped me mentally and kind of give me confidence and put me in the right direction of the position that I wanted to be in. Yeah, so so now I am a DP and I go by being a cinematographer.	1.0
Yeah and you are I mean because it Dave did a very similar sort of thing with me kind of helping helping look at who we are and distill down what we might be good at and help you support us in those ways. And by the way, Like we're not going to just you know be all about Dave and never let you hear from him. Dave will probably on here somewhat regularly. I think yeah, he's got a lot of knowledge is good guy. He's fun to talk to he's gonna be our first guest as me first for our first guest. But so I mean, yeah you like you he hoped to still you down into a DP and then the result of that was you start actually D peeing on the short films that we worked on together, right? You know, it was two weeks after I started by two weeks that we did the 48 Hour film project in Salt Lake two weeks after Drew started and we won and we well we won the audience award which I like for me. Okay, I think the most important like I want to hear more about the audience than judges to be completely honest.	1.0
Yeah, and I'm not trying to toot our own horn, but it was just a it was a but beat but no I there was just it was a really cool Dynamic of okay. I'm going into this thing and it just happened really fast so fast. So all of that was great for I think I was on the video team there for over a little bit over a year.	1.0
Yeah, and again walk into work one day laughs man walk into work.	1.0
They had the chopping block ready. It's it's rough. Yeah me and A handful of other people from the marketing team and at that point you're like am I doing something wrong?	0.0
Yeah, and it's not no. No, you didn't do anything wrong.	1.0
No, in fact, what was amazing about that layoffs was you know, every way it was sad man. I remember he was you were like ball. Oh it was I was a don't tell everybody I was ride room I waited till I got my car and I kind of you know, I just walked around just leaving Trails of Tears behind me all day long, like slipping on the my best friend just got fired. No, dude it was Cool, because you know why I was back the next day on contract worth making more making more. So this this is where it gets fun because okay third and I'm done with the layoff stories. I don't I have not gone back to a corporate job since then, there's positive things to find about these layoffs for sure.	0.0
It helped put you in the mindset and position that you're in now where you're being I think quite successful what you're doing and you would have gotten there without going through some of these bumps in the road.	1.0
Yeah, and but yeah and not only don't even label them as bumps, right because those are again or those learning experiences that I can now apply to my	1.0
Absolutely job. So would you need to lay people?	1.0
I'm scared to be that guy to be honest just because I've been that position do it. Okay, apparently that guy off. All right, so but what was cool about that is again, I was in there the next day and we I was making more money on a day rate than I was in a week and a half. Yeah, and I then I would come in and we would do pre-production and then I would go and shoots. I was still traveling with you guys. Yeah at that point and they still And in fact in March, I'm going on a diamondback sheet with yeah. Yeah, and and that's you know, it's funny to sit here and talk about it. I laugh but again, I'm kind of it's pretty lucky. That's pretty cool. That's again. It's not lucky.	0.0
I mean if you were a garbage employee and they fired you for being a garbage employee. They wouldn't be asking you back now.	0.0
It's all good. I do freelance under 43 Productions, which is my company. I've been able to get brand affiliations through YouTube and lighter epidemics. On I'm a beta tester for GoPro. I did that a lot in the snowboard industry and now I'm able to apply that into the film industry, which is has been really cool. Yeah, and for the future my long-term goal is just to be a DP on large sets.	1.0
Well, you know what man like we're on our way. I mean that brings us to you know, I've talked about me Drew's talked about Drew and now but now it's Drew an errand together like we're doing stuff together and the kind of culmination and where things I think you're leading in the future. We recently last year. We made a movie as a short film called paper cutter I wrote Directed it drew is the DP and and we'll talk about that at a later point, but we're now working on our next one together and I'm pretty sure if everything goes like we want it to Drew and I are going to be making movies together for the rest of our lives. That's the plan. Yeah, hopefully like with or without success hopefully with success. Yeah, but like I think we're always going to be doing it and I think you're you know, we're a team where the Coen brothers and Roger deakins or something like that. Yeah.	1.0
I'm the Coen Brothers I guess and this analogy. So that makes a lot of sense this next movie. You want to go ahead and say the title. Yeah, it's called jump seat.	1.0
We're going so paper cutter. The last movie was there's plenty of technical about it, but it was kind of ass, like first really getting our hooks into we'd worked on a couple other short films, but this is our first kind of try it like a real movie like something that looks good. So, I mean that feels good something that fills professional and we did I think a pretty good job we learned a lot and that's definitely stuff we can talk about probably throughout This podcast as long as we do it we learned a lot we made mistakes. We did some things right and so we made a lot of mistakes and did some things right. We did a lot of things right and we made some mistakes but we learned from all those mistakes and what we're going to apply to the next movie jump see which we want to be really I wanted to be Top Notch. I wanted to look a hundred percent professional. I wanted to feel I wanted people to be surprised that a couple dudes in Utah made this movie, right?	0.0
And I think we're on the right track for that. And so we're doing a lot of pre-production. Yeah. I was going to say we've started doing Production months ago and we don't even have our shooting dates are in April and April are ejected shooting date and we've already location scout it. I'm so excited for that one. It's uh, it's going to be so much fun. Can I tell him one of the locations for the movie? Yeah. We see that we scouted. Yeah, I do it we're shooting in a old video store. Yeah, and not only does it look like an old video store. It smells like an idiot.	1.0
That was like, it's his crappy looking as you remember video stories looking into can it is in the best way possible.	0.0
Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited about that. I think that's I mean just that itself and our lighting perspective. It's got a very dry feel. It's you know, got a very stranger things feel. Yeah. I'm just excited for it.	1.0
I think we've already put more time into this in pre-production than we had and paper cutter by far by far well, and I think that's one of the lessons we learned from paper cutter is the best time you can spend is in pre-production that planning doesn't cost very much.	1.0
That's true. So I want to I want to wrap this up here soon. But you know, we have our notes here that we've kind of been glancing at we there's a there's a thing at the end of our notes and it says we're different people though.	1.0
We are different and you	1.0
You say drew is more of a content creator and I'm more of a filmmaker and I want to touch on that because I think what makes you a great filmmaker is you're a really good writer and a good Storyteller.	1.0
Oh, thanks man.	1.0
You have obviously the visuals and you can see that but you're very good at writing and putting the story together. Whereas I feel like I can kind of come in and help you make that a vision.	1.0
Yeah, I think so and I think that's where what like your strong suit is like like you get story like you have all sorts of great ideas and where your story sounds really comes out is in Your visuals like I you know when I give you a signal we're going to shoot and I have the storyboard and I'm like, I think it's going to look something like this like you're interested like okay, where are these characters heads out where they're doing and you shape your lighting and angles and stuff kind of around that like whatever. I might not have already thought about that's where you jump in. You're like, I want to have, you know a dark back here because you know Duality or whatever, you know, and like that's that's a, you know, a huge part of the storytelling as well as well as the place where you Excel that I do pretty much nothing with is, you know, Partnerships with Brands stuff like that you're able to I mean, it's at the moment. We're still working on our funding but at the moment, it seems like the majority of its going to come from you being able to talk to these Brands they like hey, here's how making this movie can help you guys out and exchange for you to give a little bit of money to actually make it. Yeah and like so far it's looking like we're gonna get a bit of money out of that and that's something that I would not be able to like, that's not I'm not I don't really create content for Brands other than it might like my day job, but I don't sell that content to help make it.	1.0
Well, I think I think you could I think That kind of comes with me trying to sell my own company to two people at or and these are clients that are different from those brand deals and air quotes So, I think that helps and I and I'm really glad that's that's why I should say, I'm really glad that that we have each other for that and Dave has a you know brings a whole aspect of his talent and I think that's what makes a good team. I'm so used to and I know you were one time shooting weddings, you're so used to being a one-man band. So and I can't stress enough how important it is to have a whole crew with you because there's	1.0
Even just from the hands that are on set but the things in pre-production like helping you sell that and getting that money helping you write and make it a good story like taking taking critiques, you know, like you guys all read the script and you guys all have ideas like and it's being having the people around you that can be honest and open with you and say like hey this part stupid. Yeah, and then I say you're stupid. Yeah, and then do you know and then we're doing it my way take your cheeks very well. No. No, I'm just kidding. I think again this could be a huge topic later on is it will be his Taking taking criticism you can take criticism well, and it'll do nothing. But benefit you there. There's I think there's a right way and a wrong way to do it. But again, but yeah having those people around you and all having a team people with different sets of skills. All coming together to figure it out is for me. It's this is a team sport. That's what it's all about. You can do, you know, you can make little videos in your bedroom by yourself.	0.0
Wait, you don't do that because the movies for those No, Sleep puppet shows. Yeah nice, but working with a team.	1.0
Stuff will just come out better. I just well, I think you're right.	1.0
I think it comes down to being on a team and I think learning from each other which is what this podcast is all about learning from each other and helping teach others. I want to I want to leave it on a piece of advice from you Aaron. Do you have one piece of advice that kind of follows what we've been talking?	1.0
Yeah. Absolutely. And I think I should goes really hand-in-hand with we're just talking about with with criticism and the piece of advice I have is get over yourself. Like if you have an ego and you don't listen to what other people say and you don't look at yourself and be Be honest with yourself you're not going to do as well. If you if you can look at something you've done and be like I can do this better instead of like I'm awesome. Everybody bow before me you'll get better because that means you're open and willing to learn that's great.	1.0
My piece of advice is we do not fake it till we make it but I do believe we become what we believe we are right on man.	1.0
I like that.	1.0
Yeah, so so just because you don't have the nicest camera just because you're shooting with an iPhone just because you don't have A lot of lights just because you don't even have another person to make movies with leaving yourself that kind of follows what you're saying don't have an ego and I think you'll be just fine in this production world.	1.0
Yeah, like you can't do it unless you start doing it. You have to start doing it.	1.0
Yep, and then you'll be doing it just like this podcast is like we said like, hey, let's start doing a podcast. Guess what now? We're doing a podcast.	1.0
Hello and welcome to raising vegan twins. I'm so excited for you to be on this podcast. I definitely knew that when I was going to launch the podcast. I wanted to launch one with an introductory episode. That way I can let you know a little bit about me what this podcast is about and you can kind of make your decision based off of that whether you want to keep Checking in or not. So obviously this podcast is going to be about raising. My vegan twins. You'll get to follow us on our journey. They are currently about to be 14 months. So yeah, they're getting big they've been vegan basically their entire life.	1.0
Which is only 14 months long, but you'll get to see our journey and follow them and see how they're thriving in their life. So definitely check in on that. If you've read my bio or the summary of the podcast you see on there that I am calling myself the mother of all mothers. So I wanted to explain that definitely in this episode. So I'm obviously a mom of multiples. So that's one type of mom that I am the second kind of mom is just being a bonus mom. So I do have a bonus daughter. So for those of you that don't know what that is. That means she's my step kid. She's my stepdaughter. She is what I like to call my part-time kid. We have her 10% of the time and she has with her mom 90% of the time so we have her basically two times a month and In that short time frame she gets to hang out with the kids which are her siblings and her dad. She is not vegan. I think that one time she did try and attempt to be vegan. She was vegan for the weekend and she it was really funny watching her. Look at the ingredients the way I do and she'd ask me is this vegan is this vegan and I'd guide her through it and then next time we picked her up. She was like, yeah. I know. I ate a hotdog and I'm like, wow, it was really funny. And she said no.	1.0
My mom said I can't be vegan and my guess it came down to just not being able to purchase the stuff that I purchase or something like that or not wanting to cook the extra meals, which is totally understandable and I told her that well.	1.0
No, it is what it is and she can always go vegan if she really wants to when she's an adult so it's no big deal and she definitely has to do what her mom says and I think that every parent has the choice of raising their children.	1.0
However, they want to raise them and my husband and I have decided to raise our kids vegan and that doesn't mean that my daughter's biological mom has to do the same, you know, definitely different household.	1.0

It is time for me to reveal this news to you and part of the reason why I wanted to do that and why I wanted to include my surrogacy process in this podcast is because of the feedback that I've gotten by family members and non family members.

Hello Morning America.	1.0
It's your host Bridget and Caitlin here to talk about your favorite topic our favorite towel thick Disney Channel shows / movies. And today we're going to talk about classic Hannah Montana, of course, so we actually picked basically we were thinking the we're going to start this out as for TV shows will. Two episodes of a TV show and then if we do a movie we'll just just do the movie. So we picked two episodes. The first one is season 1 episode 2 Miley get your gum. And the second one is season 2 episode 20. I will always load you alright.	1.0
Okay. So let's talk about the first one. If you want to follow along with us, then pause the podcast and watch the two episodes and then come back and you can comment or let us know what you think about the episodes if we Didn't say something that you want to put out there anyways, so this episode opens with a concert which some of the episodes of Hannah Montana do. I don't know why a lot of the earlier ones. I filled it and I just it's confusing because that it opens with a concert and then I don't know it's like when was it filmed where was it filmed it because it seems like a legit concert, but it's not like in a studio like this a ton of people in the audience. What do you mean? It's not a studio? It doesn't look like a studio film space, you know, like okay, so, you know how like the difference between like for example the set at Rico's and then watching episode of like and emac like the the set is different. Like it looks like a legitimate set it like just like, you know what I mean? Yeah. Anyway, so I feel like the the concert at the beginning that's episode look like a real concert hall and that like a sound stage somewhere and a lot or whatever you think that you don't think are you saying?	0.0
That's a bad thing. I'm just	0.0
I'm saying I'm dressed like how they even did it.	1.0
Yeah, I don't I don't why?	0.0
Yeah. Well, I kind of understand why because you know, the the second scene is after the coming out of the concert.	1.0
So for this year, so to make sense, however, some of them they do that and like it makes it just opens because they open a lot of the older episodes like that. Yeah, like as I remember I could be definitely wrong. Yeah. I haven't watched any of like the first season a long time.	0.0
I do actually think it's a smart idea in terms of like promoting the Album yeah was items although I hate to say it.	0.0
Like I've seen this episode a bunch of times and I didn't listen all I knew this one.	0.0
It's the song was just like you I knew it but I also listen man Montana a lot. So she's got some good music. I brought absolute pop in all caps.	1.0
I really like that song the first thing that like the episode goes into that's plot-based is they actually introduced Lola lilies like alter ego which is amazing and iconic.	1.0
And at first I was like, oh,	0.0
Okay, so they're introducing Willa and then she just like comes out with a dog and I'm not a dog it is the dog's name is Thor?	0.0
Yeah, it's like a little I don't know. What type of dish it's you or something. Yeah, I don't know where it's like definitely a Heritage. Okay. So the thing about the dog is I had a well I have several notes with the dog. They also wrote for - whose dog he wrote did this where did this dog come from?	0.0
But I wrote that down but then later I wrote down the the dog was definitely a plot device because the whole point of having the dog was that	1.0
Oliver's hand pops into frame which is the most hilarious thing I've ever seen the way his hand Pops in through a limo window.	1.0
I wrote down that was literally the best thing I've ever seen it was comical and I loved it anyway, so all those are Oliver wants handed a kisses hand, but the dog has his it and so that they just had the dog just for that.	1.0
But whose dog is it? Why do they give it a name? It's just like a plot device.	0.0
It's lazy writing. Honestly, like very lazy writing. That's this whole show has lazy writing and I'll definitely have a couple more notes about At but I just was like dog and and while they were in the car, all of the lines were total plot narration, like explaining and feeding the audience stuff that we didn't already know which I guess is like Fair because it's only the second episode by you just referring to the fact that like Oliver had a crush on her.	0.0
I don't know exactly what they were talking about.	0.0
They were just like kind of narrating the plot and it was kind of annoying.	0.0
Yeah. I mean, I guess that's okay for a pilot. This is the second episode.	1.0
I just like the fashion show not tell kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. The kid shows was not going to I can expect like too much but also at the same time, I feel like this is definitely one of those shows were I in theory. I'm like, okay all the shows from when we were kids are definitely better than the ones from now, but this one is not I hate to say it but a lot of the lady that lazy writing kind of got yeah.	0.0
I don't know. I just got caught up in it while you're watching it. And now that you're saying I kind of do understand the show don't tell thing because it's kind of like if we like we're filming us walking to class more like G Kate. Unlike I love walking to class like that sounds like cheesy.	0.0
So as yeah kind of what you're saying like it's like it's like vlogging.	1.0
Yeah, you know Danny Gonzalez has that video about Tessa Brooks where he talks about her once he call it boring Vlogs are boring Vlogs because she's just like, all right, and we're going to go to the beach and then the next clip is like debit Emil and she's like and we went to the beach and we had fun. It's like, okay.	0.0
Well, that's not interesting to watch because telling me anyways, that's a tangent that we don't really need to go off on because it was just like that one scene where I was like upset that they	0.0
Like spoon-feeding the audience these facts because especially because we already knew that Oliver liked Hannah because of the first episode. Because they were trying to break into the first episode.	0.0
We are trying to break into Hanna's dressing room and she throws her towel to him and then heat up the next day like at the next day the next day at school.	0.0
He's like I have him ideas. All right. Yeah. You're right. You're right, right. So I don't know. Um, one thing I want to point out is that when I was in Middle School the most embarrassed. So everyone has like, you know fashion thing they did in middle school as embarrassing. Mine was putting a belt over my clothes and I always and I always thought Not that this came from Alex from Wizards of Waverly Place. I thought that that was where I got this fashion, but I saw as soon as the opening scene came out and she's on stage wearing a belt over her clothes. I was like it started with her.	0.0
Okay, but why was the best place was right under her boobs or was that a way?	1.0
So there's that picture you were you felt like yeah. I used to put in like middle. You're not around my boobs directly under like a support system. Are you I just wanted to talk about that.	1.0
I'd like to officially blame Miley Cyrus in her costume designers.	0.0
I did actually write that the the outfits were iconic in the set. Have you seen that post? That's like I just saw the set from Hannah Montana and I can't believe it's not real and every time I see that I'm like wow because that for especially like Rico's. Yeah, which he wasn't even in this episode at always disappointing.	1.0
Yeah. That's that is so cheesy, but I kind of love it is nice charm to it.	1.0
Yeah their house looks great with your Decor though. I have some comment. Well, we can talk about the house there in the house more in the next episode so we can talk about that in a little bit.	1.0
But okay, so let's get into the plot of this episode a little bit because we've really we anyways so basically the plot this episode is that Oliver is in love with Hannah, but the like the secondary plot for him is that he's terrified of gum because his grandmother like spitting come on.	0.0
I just want to point out this scene where they like showed her spitting gum like like it was supposed to be an Simple like she looked like she was just spitting it out like it was so it was like tensional and cheesy and I think the funniest part is I was gonna make a comment about how that was also like lazy writing that they did show the flashback but it's so quick and it's just it makes no sense.	0.0
Like he's a baby. How does he even remember that? But it's just he's still in his crib when we showed it was too funny in common goal like that that flashback for me to even comment on it and then when they zoomed back out Out of the flashback like That's So Raven style. His face was so funny. Yeah, and I was just like, yeah, I can't write anything down about this because it's just too funny.	1.0
Yeah kudos to Mitchel Musso so you can have a bad writing and you know, it's so funny it but it's the acting that saved it. I think yeah the actors in the show our good good and bad how I have it depends on how you're talking about because I think Mitchel Musso is really good in this episode.	1.0
However, Miley's acting sucks in the entire first season. It's so cheesy and uncomfortable, and I'm not If it's just because of the writing but it none of it seems like genuine. Yeah, I agree Lily is also sometimes a little but also like I wrote in my next note is like I can't believe how young they are like, they're supposed to be you said just before high school.	0.0
Yeah. I think I think in the next season they get into high school. So they're either an eighth grade. They might even being seventh but then again there is Young and I guess that accounts for the fact that they seem a little less mature when they're reading the lines, but also the lives that they're given are clear. Lee written by adults for kids and they're not they just don't seem like things kids would say, I don't know. Yeah because like you look at a show like Andy Mac or something like it's very we're going to always be comparing. Yeah, but just like the you can tell like they actually like talk to children and like you understand kids at that time. So yeah, I agree with you.	0.0
I don't just doesn't seem like even it rang very true for me and the end of the episode. When Miley was trying to convince all of her that she that he should be in love with Mandy Moore instead of handing, Montana Montana. Yeah, and I was like, I barely knew who and Mandy Moore. I only know who may be more is because she was entangled.	0.0
Okay. I see I knew her before that but like still like the thing that I knew her from was like A Walk to Remember which is Nicholas Sparks movie that I probably should have known at the time. So yeah, I agree with you on that. I don't think that she was the person to compare people to okay my neck.	0.0
Yeah, my next note about actually have a legit note about the writing. Is that Robby Ray calls Jackson's son.	1.0
And I'm sorry. I that's underwriting thing that I can't stand is when characters say like sister or brother to their just call them. No one realizes his sister brother. You're not going to you're like you're not you wouldn't enter a room and go.	0.0
Hey big sis. Like that's yeah and you wouldn't say son. You would say their name.	0.0
Well, it was just I'm going to counter that with he supposed to become. Tree and so that's supposed to be kind of like that's true vernacular. Like he wouldn't call my league daughter but like saying son is a little more I guess normal. It's good point. I'm okay with that. The line cut-offs were funny. I don't know if you noticed that too. There were a couple times like Oliver would start to like say that like he started to say a poem at one point and then they like cut him off and like he was like, oh, let's think of what's a rhyme for something and maybe white.	1.0
Yeah, and I was got if they had like three	1.0
Different lines like that though. We're like someone they cut them off before. They said something. I wish that I had written down examples, but I just thought it was funny.	1.0
Okay.	1.0
So let's talk about the secondary this legitimate and secondary part of this episode, which is the whole Jackson and his girl car quote-unquote girl car thing. Yeah. I hated that. Yeah. I'm not sure if I was the only one and it's funny because I haven't watched these episodes in a long time because when I do re-watch Hannah Montana It's usually the later Seasons. I felt like they I don't know. I just there's a lot of stuff that happened in Even this episode not only this episode but also the episode that we all the second episode we watched the didn't seem like it's a good well. Yeah it really didn't. Yeah.	0.0
No, I'd like our thing. I really like and and spoiler alert.	1.0
The whole plot of the girl car is like Jackson buys a car and then like he leaves and tries to like turn it in because I'm his friend makes fun of him for having a girl car and then Robbie tries to turn it in because the neighbor makes fun of it and then Robbie comes back because the They wouldn't take the car back. So he like made the music louder.	0.0
No, my car is the car bounces. Yeah, like like straight out of style.	0.0
No, it's just for stationary doesn't do that when I don't know.	0.0
I mean it can but I just thought it was stupid also the car I'm sorry.	0.0
Like the car was nice if yeah, it's like a dream car.	1.0
It's a convertible. Well that and like there's no way Jackson could afford a car like that.	0.0
Like I was thinking that even like they tried to explain it by like this happened in the car and this cat gave Borg in the front seat. A brand new car it was ridiculous. And yeah, I just talked we did you mention the neighbor Donzi.	0.0
Let's talk because I do believe they and I remember more fat jokes about him again didn't age.	0.0
Well like not cool.	0.0
Honestly, the thing that saves Us episode was just all over in general. His character was great. I like I love the whole Oliver's like Locker man thing is adorable. Yeah and iconic and I think I found his Hannah Montana dedication kind of	1.0
earring. Really? Yeah.	1.0
Oh and they also forced out or foreshadowed all over in Lily's relationship, which I'm sure they did not even know it was going to no, I don't think so because I'm sure that writing didn't happen for many years down the road that was really funny especially from a perspective of right now. Yeah knowing that eventually they would write them in as a couple and several seasons down the road. So that was kind of I like that.	1.0
I also wanted to point out. When did I? You know, this is this is part of the actual plot of the show. But like all of our at one point is like two feet from three people that he's close with Robbie Miley and Lily and he doesn't recognize any of them like something died down but like he knows their voices. You don't probably looks the same and I'm going to say this about the other ones who like, I don't know like he is Robby Ray and he always talks about Hannah Montana being his daughter.	0.0
Yeah, so I don't know how that passes like, all he does is put on a mustache and he's been seeing this for	0.0
Years, like - teacher is going to look at and be like, oh my gosh, you're right.	1.0
But the other thing is that like Oliver and Miley are like in the end and the end of episode like talking about how close they were like out like stuff.	1.0
They like stuff that they did when they were kids like such clearly. They've been best friends for like a long time.	1.0
There's a lot going to people's birthday parties and I just was like, I can't like if I heard your voice from behind a door, I would know it was you. Yeah regardless of where I was. Yeah, so I just don't I don't I don't understand I get that. It's a kid show. And like at the time I didn't think much of it but it's just come on. Yeah, I mean I understand for her classmates as a little different but again, like you said something supposed to be that way. Yeah. Oh, I know this is stupid, but I noticed when Donzi left and they were still like out in the parking lot area. They have Fountain that's just full of flowers. No water so funny.	0.0
I thought that was so funny. I wrote it down. I wrote what	1.0
Although I can't let's talk.	0.0
Okay, let's talk about the gum chewing yeah disgusting the whole scene with Hannah and Oliver was so awkward bothering me.	0.0
I just it was so uncomfortable.	0.0
I can't even imagine how all over must have felt. I know because you're being so weird scene.	0.0
I you know, that's a very common plot of a kids show like you look at I don't know if you remember this, I'm gonna pull out Nickelodeon. Sorry that this is a Disney podcast, but there's no sort of Drake & Josh where they do the same thing like Drake doesn't like a girl. More so he pretends to like be really disgusting to like get her to not like him. So I guess I think I'm used to heat like a spaghetti dinner. It's like I don't know but I feel like I'm very used to like that plot device which like again. It hadn't no it's not my favorite. But like it didn't bother me, I guess.	0.0
Yeah. It was just kind of I think the lines were just kind of strange for me. Yeah. I don't know. I also was just like while I was watching that scene. It just became oh when Oliver walked. Down after Lily called him to tell him that Hannah was there and he tapped that guy on the shoulder and then the guy turned around was like what did he say? It was? I don't even remember he was like, please leave. Yeah, something like that. It was really funny anyways, but I was just like looking at the setting and just wondering where the heck was that supposed to be my because I know I know but it's like the it was the beach.	0.0
Yeah, but there were tons of like plants everywhere.	1.0
That's not what a beach looks like where they I wasn't paying that much.	0.0
So were they in the ground?	1.0
I it was weird and there was like a rock. I don't know. It was just a strange setting another thing.	0.0
I want to talk about. I'm going back to costumes again all of our had this double pole.	1.0
Oh, oh that was still going on. It was so funny though. He was just wearing a polo on top of another. It's like double Kali like there's soap. I can picture it in my head right now.	1.0
What else do I have to say?	1.0
Oh one more thing. I want to talk about just that Robby. Ray was not helpful at all. Nibbling either situation. First of all, he like totally gave into like Jackson by a girl car and like was like embarrassed about it. That's not good.	0.0
Parenting know there's a forgot I was supposed to be their only parent.	0.0
Yeah, and then with Miley he was like, oh I think Oliver needs a new girlfriend. Like that's not there also like 14.	0.0
Yeah. I just don't think that was the best.	0.0
I think he should have just been like fine. You can tell him like, I don't know.	1.0
I just I have a note about not in this episode. And the next episode that they make especially Robby Ray looks so stupid.	0.0
They make all the adults look ridiculous. Like like like yeah. Okay, they make him look really stupid.	0.0
Like because I don't know.	0.0
I think that's just a thing in kid shows. These adults are kind of stupid.	0.0
Especially Wizards.	1.0
That's like they do that a lot. Yeah, you guys think about like the dads are always really cheap the moms are like always wanting to be the star of the show. That's true.	0.0
Like that's it's just as Liv and Maddie to the And the pants Liv and Maddie is such a big really the big offender of that.	0.0
But at least like Amy and Bob have like good moments on Good Luck Charlie. I feel like Karen and is it also Bob?	1.0
That's the dad on it's definitely Karen. Yeah. Remember the dad's name. But anyways, the parents on Liv and Maddie are just like ridiculous like over-the-top.	0.0
They are the top and it's just it's the point where I was always like, okay, like that's enough.	0.0
Yeah, so I don't know so I definitely see that with this show, but I have to say like this isn't the worst on that. No, no and same with wizards. But okay.	1.0
I'm ready to move on to the next one anything else to say.	1.0
My only other note is that I've never ever seen licorice gum in my life.	0.0
I thought about that too as soon as as soon as she pulled out the gum.	1.0
I was like isn't it Licorice and then she pulls out licorice gum. Oh and I took a note. It was like Greg on that. She put it in her mouth and then immediately like she was chewing tar.	0.0
It looks That's what it looked. Like. That's what I wrote down. Okay, let's move on. Okay.	1.0
So the second episode we're talking about is called I will always love you and I pointed out to Bridget before we started watching at this is a pun on the song. I Will Always Love You by Dolly Parton who's in episode which of course I didn't know at the time but it's actually kind of I thought that was fun.	1.0
Yeah, especially I like that all the titles of the episodes or song titles. I think it's very smart.	1.0
This is a good episode for us to watch now because we're doing 9 to 5 the musical at our college. So we're very we feel very Very close to Dolly Parton. Yes present moment.	1.0
That's maybe that's why I was totally biased towards doll me to level so she was less annoying. Yeah.	1.0
So if you look at the plot of this episode, it's basically like Miley wins an award for an award show and her man law comes to visitor and she finds out that Dolly Miley's Orion. Does it Aunt?	1.0
Oh, yeah godmother to they said Aunt Aunt Dolly.	1.0
Yeah, but they also said it was their God that's confusing. Yeah, I mean anyways, but um that she was So staying at the house and they had this long going argument going on because Dolly stole Bama so Elvis from them like they both dated like memo how to Summer Elvis Elvis like Elvis Presley. So that was interesting. I remember this being one of my favorite episodes. I find it very stressful.	1.0
Yes know I always felt it was very stressful.	0.0
Yeah. So let's just get into it. So in this mamuh is played By Vicki Lawrence. And as soon as she came on the screen, there were start searing and so Kailyn are like what and so we looked at that so she's in The Carol Burnett Show. She is Place Carol Burnett know. Okay, so she's just famous from that. No, Carol. Burnett is an actress. Yes and a singer. I guess.	1.0
She's just in it. I've never seen The Carol Burnett Show at a time of ever seen. It was on an infomercial that I saw for like 30 minutes while I was getting my nails done.	0.0
Yeah, so we have heard of it, but then they put that is like I feel like that I feel like	1.0
Cheering was definitely for the adults in the room. Like if my mom was watching it with me as a kid. She might get that and again, I didn't know who Dolly Parton was either.	1.0
Oh, I see a kid, but I didn't know who Dolly Parton was but I will say like they that's probably a button to you know, like they don't film he's in front of a live studio not they added that in so they must know I don't know. Anyways, let's move on from that because that's Oh, I thought it was strange that they both wanted to stay at their house specifically Dolly because if I was in my	0.0
Miami I would want a hotel and also the beginning of the episode starts out with my Lee Jackson fighting over which rum mammals going to stay in either Miley's rumor Jackson's room, which if you know Hannah Montana at all, you know, there's an entire episode dedicated to how disgusting and unlivable the conditions in Jackson's remark and yet they still make mamaw like stand there and watch it there, but just because I'm pretty sure that that episode doesn't happen until am not a hundred percent sure, but I'm pretty sure that episodes For this one, so I didn't get that. I got really confused.	0.0
They could have literally had someone stay in my lady's closet and would have been fine.	1.0
That's so sweet pause it. That's so sad. Anyways, so I wrote Dolly's legit the most iconic woman. Yeah. Thank you so much. One thing I did notice that they actually I thought was decent writing is that the way that Mama and Robbie race speak is similar, which is makes sense because they're supposed to be mother and son. Okay, especially also because they're from the same place. I thought it was I said great writing, but I think that's okay writing. Ting oh, I know you're going to I'm sure you were to note about this but I didn't notice it in the first episode that I did notice it like poignantly and this episode the in-between see music.	1.0
Whoa. The first one was the funniest.	1.0
But yeah, those kill me every time I watched a thread ones of just just those and it was oh my God, I honestly that's one of the funniest and most iconic things about Hannah Montana's in between music because that makes a lot about that.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
Yeah, well yeah they put they put in weird ones at certain times because I think it's weird place not it's not that it's like I don't know I think it's just the way it sounds like it's just weird vocalizing like I think that iCarly has in between music too and I could be wrong not to bring up a Nickelodeon show on a Disney related podcast again, but I think that they also have him to music the Miranda Cosgrove and singing It's just instrumental but I think that's why I don't like this one and it's weird because again, she's just like whoa whoa, whoa	0.0
I don't think it's the vocals that bothered me.	0.0
It's like they they made weird placement for it. Like they got in like a minor fight and it played like really sad.	0.0
I'm talking you think it was just a lot of like, I don't know.	0.0
I mean a certain way to felt like, okay and then but the first one that they played was just like we were just like, oh my gosh, we just both lists each other and burst out laughing.	1.0
Okay.	1.0
So one of the things that that I brought it at the point that I brought up before about how there was rioting in this new episode. The didn't really age well and like wasn't appropriate for children is that they continually use the word trans?	0.0
Yeah.	1.0
I brought that to which bothered me so much not like if this was like an adult's TV show I've that would have that would have slid so like I wouldn't have cared. Yeah. However, this is a kids TV show and also I just like Dolly Parton and I didn't enjoy that. She was referring to the hardest drink.	0.0
Yeah that know I thought that was way too risque.	0.0
I did not appreciate that and then the fact that the first time I was like, okay like whatever and then they said it a second time and I was like Okay, like you kind of hit home the second time especially for me. Yeah didn't really like that. But then immediately after that there's secondary plot with Rico and Oliver which makes it so much better the okay.	1.0
I have to say I don't love this episode but the secondary pot with recode Oliver was really funny and the acting was also really funny. Yeah. Thanks.	1.0
Rico being more annoying than he was in this think. He's more annoying with Jackson that does make sense because he had Oliver like friendly Yeah.	1.0
So basically the secondary plot and the up	1.0
Is that Oliver is trying to help Rico film a public access commercial for Rico's and it's so funny because they have the exact same hair haircut isn't not be worst of objects and Rico and Oliver all a nursery ever so brother Rico's brother the exact same. Yeah, it was terrible like the okay.	1.0
So I didn't notice that they were the same haircut until they sat down at the table and that I need to go right away. Oliver sitting next to each other and I was like, they must have the same hair.	1.0
It was exactly the color. That's the hard. Yeah, it looks awful. It was terrible.	0.0
I didn't notice that Robbie had decent hair considering it was long and he was a father true. I thought it was okay.	1.0
I don't know it was like I hated it when I was little the funny part of this part is if you watch the episode you'll know what I mean. But basically when Oliver starts to film Rico his face goes from like a big smile and it just dropped and it's so it's just the Comedy of it and I just it was it was good. Yeah, I don't know. I don't Moises Arias. That's the kid who plays Rico. It was just funny good acting on his part kudos to him.	1.0
Yeah, honestly because he saved episode of my opinion moving on from that.	1.0
I did I wrote wrote Oh My the Hat I wrote I wrote big hat. So we're talking about here is when violation and Lily the stuff that she bought at the mall with Mamaw and with Dolly so it with Dolly she bought this kind of like Teal Aqua Marine like sequined little mini dress and then ma'am. I want her this big like over the top hat that if you clap twice the lights come on and it's just so funny.	1.0
It was okay.	1.0
The thing with the hat is that it The Hat itself was funny, but then when Miley said I have an idea and the lights went on. I did not think that was funny.	0.0
I thought I was okay.	1.0
I don't I did writing but it's it was just not I'm sorry the I thought the role play between Dolly and mamaw was kind of funny so Miley. Only dressed up Lily was Maman Miley was dilated that really so I see how they like acted. Well what I liked about it was Jackson. I thought he was funny. It was funny when he played Elvis.	1.0
It was funny but unnecessary the thing about yeah, I okay. So the thing about this is that I thought that the idea of it was funny and that the outfits that they put on the spot on and like, I don't know I thought that was well done. However, I wrote that I don't understand like from their point of view how that was supposed to solve anything.	1.0
So basically, I just don't I feel like dressing up in them as As them didn't really solve anything overall, especially because all that the I'm going to go off on a tangent they were so obnoxious.	0.0
They were the fighting was obnoxious and it they're supposed to be the adults which is why I brought up the whole before they make the adults look stupid a real adult, especially someone who claims to care about their granddaughter and their goddaughter that much would never ruin an awards night evening so they could fight about stupid shit.	0.0
Yeah, like I just to the point where I was like, I don't understand why yeah these characters.	0.0
And that's why the episode makes me feel uncomfortable. I don't know about you.	0.0
I agree and then at the end of the episode after they like have like literally brawl. They're literally having a broad.	0.0
They want Dolly full it mama like onto her head when they were like, they were whipping the body around I was thinking to myself that must have been fun to film like whipping dummies around like they don't like what they did and it was very obvious, but I thought that would have been fun.	0.0
But it but they they blink body-slammed were Like body-checked Robbie Ryan to the staged. Yeah, that was kind of funny that was funny. But it was just over the top and I just felt so uncomfortable and Miley when she was giving the speech and she was like cut it out.	0.0
Yeah. Yeah around that was just so uncomfortable. Yeah.	0.0
Well what I didn't like is at the end Miley's like I'm you know, I'm still mad at you but like I'm not going to like say I hate you forever and then they were like, you know what problem solved let's be nice to each other like um, no, that's not how problems work and Um, if you actually if that milk because if that was like if they had the mindset of like I want to be nice for Miley sake that wouldn't have happened in the first place. They were you don't all of a sudden get that mindset after you've done something bad. They did not care about her like they acted like they really cared about her that night, but they didn't if they didn't really care about her at all because they couldn't put aside their differences for like 10 minutes.	0.0
Yeah just didn't even have to stand next to each other. I'm not really sure why they did.	0.0
Yeah. Yeah.	1.0
Um, that's why I just was uncomfortable with the plot of this episode because it was just those moments.	0.0
Mostly mamo mamo to like Dolly very back at her butt like it was it but after only after she made like three comments in a row like correct.	1.0
She was kind of it was just I just didn't although I did the thing about this plot that I did like was when they cut to Jackson and Lily on the couch back at the house. That was kind of yeah, I like that and she really was like, why'd you put on wrestling and he was like, this is the award show. That was funny.	1.0
Yeah. I'm kind of disappointed that Jackson wasn't a bigger part in either of these episodes I would Maybe we can do a review on kicking it at some point. Oh, yeah, she talked about him and that show but yeah, I would. I just want to be able to like review his character and specifically in a more but I felt like I couldn't because he wasn't like really the biggest character in either these episodes. Yep. And then I just wanted to comment at the end. They did like a quad what quartet? Yeah, that's the fourth of singing and that was really good.	1.0
It was good. It's just true friend. That's one of my favorite songs. Yeah, because I had that album when I was a kid. Yeah.	1.0
Okay. So the one thing that redeem this episode for me was in fact the ending, however We already discussed how the ending was kind of a little much because they were like, oh like we should have forgiven each other before me like blah blah blah and that was just in genuine. However, the message kind of was genuine to me.	1.0
Like I thought there was a really good message about forgiveness and the importance of family and sticking together, which is something really good for kids. However, I just wish that it was done better. It was done in a way where it didn't seem in genuine. Like it didn't come across as we're only doing this because we have to do you know that yeah, so I'm not I didn't love that episode. I didn't love either episode episodes. I don't know.	0.0
I just this show I remember being really great and I remember watching it was all like Sunday night like 7:30 or whatever.	1.0
I remember really enjoying it and like my babysitter watched it when she was over at her house, but I just I don't know it's not as funny as I remember. Yeah, especially because my like my favorite Disney Channel show of all time is Wizards. Yeah, and that show was just like hilari way up there silly re-plot like Everything was new and interesting good. Yeah, Alton is good. And the characters are lovable and not obnoxious most of them.	1.0
Yeah. I mean you look at by the time I was in Middle School. I got to a point where I was like, oh like this shows annoying like shake it up as annoying ant farms enjoying the actress has really shaken up and former both terrible shows, which will probably get interviews about those but like I'm just I'm straight talking about like the main characters that actresses like I would always be like, oh like they're so annoying. I never thought Miley Cyrus was annoying and like watching this I was Like I understand like what she is someone. Yeah, which I think is also just like part of being able to like look at something when you're older and being because wouldn't even say our ages. We're like both 20 now. So when this show came out was show came out in 2005. Yeah, or yeah, it was definite. I was we were young	0.0
I don't so I it makes sense to me the like of course. I don't find it as funny now but 2006 that's the first episode that makes sense.	1.0
But I don't know. I just I think it's it was just one of those things where I like that I'm able to look back on it and say, okay.	1.0
Well maybe not all of the shows were good when we were kids because my mom even says that to me and I say like old Disney was better and she's like, okay. Well, I used to watch some of those shows with you and they were not that good and my mom likes any max you seen a few episodes of me, so, I don't know.	0.0
Just I think it really depends. Yeah, it really does.	1.0
No, this is just not I like Hannah Montana. I enjoyed watching it. I don't think that it's one of the better Disney shows from when we were a kid.	1.0
I don't think I'd enjoy watching it. I didn't watch it when I was little like I enjoy it for the memory is not for the content.	0.0
I would say I'm just curious because we definitely are bringing to talk about some other shows that people would say our garbage. Like I really think that we should do an episode on buzard Favre because that was so hated and also because I don't really like Jake Paul another Like to see him and the acting setting yeah, really really skimmed those episodes and we get to see what's Olivia Robidoux. Yeah, and it's like that's not High School Musical musical the series.	0.0
So I'm just I'm curious to see like comparing that show and ant farm and Shake It Up to Hannah Montana, which is something that people really Revere as a great Disney Channel show from when we were kids.	1.0
I just want to see if we have to say similar things about them because I kind of feel like we might yeah.	1.0

It's a drag race AfterBuzz TV drinking game. Mark disobeys his own rules take a drink. Yeah, what did you guys think of the episode? I thought this was a really creative challenge. I was excited by it a fresh new challenge. I love Design Channel channels. I love design challenges. They remind me so much of like like Project Runway and I just love seeing everyone kind of work as a cohesive unit. Well, some people work on the cohesive unit and I just thought it was really fun. It was very light-hearted. So everything's positive. Just wanted somebody to hand me that paper.	1.0
I was reaching for my champagne. I was like, I'm sorry, I enjoyed the episode because like we've never seen this challenge before so it's pretty new. I loved like I guess it was a comedy challenge to get some way. So it was Personality. Yeah.	1.0
It was all it was a lot of things rolled into one you had to have a lot of different you had of Hosting skills. You had a design skills comedy was in there as well.

Oh, I'd be happy to tell you I thoroughly enjoyed the episode. I thought everybody was wonderful and nobody should have gone home. Are you feeling okay? Oh, yeah, this is not okay. I don't accept this Marie. Where are you Lorraine? I actually really did enjoy the episode. I actually thought it was a great Challenge and I will admit when they do great things. I thought it was a great. Challenge because it is something that drag queens have to do maybe not from start to finish creating the whole event, but I have a lot. Yeah, I have a lot to say later, but that's all I'll say right now and everyone who's joining us in the chat room.	1.0
I see Chapel Theo Hutton Bryce Mitchell KenKen 29. Thank you guys for tuning in every week, especially this week when rent live is happening and you're watching us instead. Oh thank goodness. Good thoughts. Oh, that's a cool name. And challenging and Jesus together tomji. That's you could be watching valentina's sing live. But instead you're watching us.	1.0
So we thank you. So we thank you for I said I assumed Mark was always drunk on set Bryce that is not a kind thing to say my mother wanted some time. It's just every other episode every other every up. The one I wasn't here wasn't drunk. That's why you weren't here.	1.0
So the main challenge we had Latrice come back and then Latrice got two pair everyone off. So she picked her team it was Trinity and Manila and then she put mode and Monique together and Valentina and Naomi together. It didn't seem like I got the only one that seemed kind of sabotage. She was putting Valentina and Naomi together since it was kind of like a consensus that they were the bottom. Not last week, but the week before yeah state but Latrice was smart to get with the frontrunners.	1.0
Yes. She was kind of herself with anyone else because she's like she knows the RuPaul curse the combat Queen pierce the yes, come back.	1.0
You mentioned right out the door.	1.0
Yeah, so she broke that which she did good. Yeah.	1.0
I felt bad for Naomi though having to work for with Valentina. I'm surprised the trees didn't put Monique with Valentina because they kind of have like a rivalry going on. Yeah and you know Monique and Monet they have like This friendship and they're always working together. I don't know like I'm kind of like I wish they wouldn't work as together as much personally because it's kind of like that's what I think that this challenge is right up their alley. Yes. Yes. So them that they needed Mark you can speak.	0.0
No, it's going to raise my hand from down. No, I was thinking do you think and maybe they'll say at the beginning of next week's episode. Do you think Latrice was being strategic in like trying to create issues or she thought she Was generally putting the best people together best people together.	1.0
Yeah, nasty like that.	0.0
Yeah, I don't think so either because if she was she would have done that. Yeah.	0.0
She was really I think she would have mentioned it to ya ugly and the confessional. Okay. Go back to my Champion. So Valentina Naomi did Club 96 which was supposed to be like Studio 54 wait. We also need together real quick little ASMR 96	0.0
Hands down. The best part of their thing was Naomi doing. Yeah and Charlie felt like a Saturday night Live's. Yeah when he said that I was like, oh my God, that's exactly what it was. Yeah, the funny part of it to me was the show they had to do with the name that garlic and they messed up. That was fun. Yes.	1.0
Yeah, that was terrible. It's just I mean, it's interesting because you saw Valentina read the other teens were having like a You looking club and she was so concerned about the club looking nice that she didn't think about the concept of who did you say was this you who were you referring to Valentina Valentina? Okay. Yeah. She's shading the other teams for not having it look nice. Right, but but there's the concept ended up being not as strong as the other one trunks doesn't look nice, but they do well. I'm usually drunk when I go in there so and then Naomi ended up fronting most of the work because like Valentina wasn't helping like write the scripts and she was kind of like joking on joking around while they were trying to like paint the set which is funny to watch but then you're thinking like if I was Naomi I would be I would probably be more like tents and visibly nervous. Because I would be like no dude. We need to get this props to her for like kind of caring that team. I feel like Valentina and I went back into her old because she'd kind of the same thing last her season when she wasn't like studying the words like she kind of just coasted through it and that what's in her home. So I felt like Valentine just like missed the mark on this missed the mark this episode. So I think so too. I just felt bad for her.	0.0
It's our confessional. It was a lot of I and the Fantasy III and never once did she say we know and I was just like you didn't do you didn't do nothing but paint a wall really, you know, yeah, but the outfit was cute the painting outfit.	1.0
I wear that to church to save painting out but I liked I liked manila's painting outfit. I would like a hot like backstreet boy.	1.0
Yeah. I put I had to put this down Latrice getting into the jumper. Yeah deserves also watch that. It was the best part of the show it to me that was funny hilarious.	1.0
I like the O in the chat. He said production must have helped them with the sets. Yeah, just probably true.	1.0
Okay. So if you go to when Monique a Monet were doing there, there's sketching out. They had like markers on a board and then they show manila's all like profession right today. She's a graphic design.	1.0
Right? So Monet Monique's there's was the black hole, which was like a mystery alien sci-fi. Why thing going on first off? I love that idea because anybody is going to want to go to a club called the black hole just for the injection marks a lot. So every Tuesday and Thursday to me their whole concept if you look at just the concept would be the most intriguing because I have the I would want to be What's going on there? They have some sort of like alien baby display.	1.0
Like I think there's was the most creative. I like I said, this is right up their alley. They were able to shine.	1.0
Nobody actually like talk over each other like Jersey Justice which was surprising props ammonia because I feel like Monique does that she kind of talks over her like partner a lot of the time but they Vibe well together. They have a lot of chemistry there probably goods are great to meet ya, you know, they were black and yellow also were they	1.0
I don't need your money Kappa black and yellow black and yellow I notice I when I watch the second time, I went oh, hold up. Yeah. I thought there must have been a yellow and black challenge. Yeah my money they got cut or something.	0.0
I also think that their outfits look better than the runways. I know we'll talk about Runway. Yeah, but also I think they're the strongest MCS out of the bunch. So they did really well. I thought they were underrated. I was confused when Michelle said something along the lines of what did she say? Like, was it outer space or was it a lie the same I'm like, what are you talking about, Michelle?	1.0
Same thing.	1.0
Yeah the kind of go hand in hand.	1.0
I actually Michelle's not I'm finding myself saying this more this season. I don't know why but I actually kind of agree with her because I felt like it was a very it was kind of like let's create a theme that can be anything. So we don't have to be as specific we can kind of do this and we can kind of do that we can kind of do this. So, I think that was kind of her point and I did kind of agree with that because it was it was like there was an alien, baby. Baby that you could touch but then there were moons and stuff. And then there I don't know. It did seem a little it didn't seem as cohesive as the hive which I know we will get into and I have notes about it, but I liked it and I agree. I think they were hosting wise I thought they did a good job.	1.0
I to me that was out of all of the clubs. That was the most appealing. So I would have picked them as the winner and we can talk about this later, but I do think That it was a little bit dick in the soup for them to not win over the Beehive team.	1.0
Well because this is like Latrice is redemption was should be the name of the episode. Yeah, that's exactly what it was. Well that being said are we talking about the hive now?	1.0
Yeah, so it turned into T. Manila Latrice. They had a beehive theme which on its face the concept of a club as a beehive. I was like, oh, I don't know how this is gonna work. But when when everything came together and you wash it and then that ending with the release the bees I thought I thought that was amazing after that.	1.0
It's so funny. I see the mean there was a mean like that with Oprah and it's like release the bees and all the bees in the crowd was I don't know. It's funny. I thought that was funny. So yeah when I watched it the third time I took these notes because I just thought and this is my point and I think what I do this when I read this, it'll make my point of what I was talking about with Monique and Monet. There was like the honey like the set itself was just gorgeous the honey dripping off the shelves brilliant attention to detail the design. I said the design in general the sweetest. I probably the sweetest hot spot.	1.0
That was one of the things they said like to promote the club.	1.0
Oh, right, right like and again like referring to the honey and the behead sweetest hotspot clever. What's the buzz all about? I just Loved it sent sprawling luxurious space of twenty by sixteen feet, which I thought was hysterical anybody time any time sending. Somebody said honey, it fit the theme it's the bee's knees, which they said multiple times. It's all the buzz the be teeny the FIB biatch one of the most brilliant thing Beasley the Vib keeper, which why haven't we been using the I just thought it was just tripping spelling bee. I just I just I just kept going and it was just that attention to detail and it was so specific and not one thing didn't not match everything worked perfectly. And I think that that's why they won over the other two because the other ones I felt was just kind of so General.	1.0
Yeah, black Unity, man. So I they had a they had a what was it? There was like a beam me up Scotty drink and I like that it would correlate. I think yeah, there was a beam me up drink the person serving. It was Scotty like it was like a space thing.	1.0
I know but I just think that it was just I just think the it was just so specific and so like every single thing was so spot-on. I don't know it just it just it just seemed like it was so perfect.	1.0
Like there wasn't a flaw I might have been having said that don't you think all three of them should have won instead of just two of them. That was the other problem. That's not how the show	1.0
Goes Jackie they all three can't it's wrong, but I do think but I do think it was kind of a punishment for Manila for because she was speaking. I think we can all agree. She was speaking over them and she was kind of jumping over them and trying to outshine them which is a competition not a problem, but I think it was kind of their way of going we're going to teach you a lesson here and I didn't maybe even been just to kind of snap her back because I do think she's getting a little Well, she's becoming a front-runner now. She's right lane right like we got a week.	0.0
Yeah, so that's just I feel like my eternity like I love Manila I want her to do well, but I feel like Trinity is kind of more of a front runner now at this point than the Anila because she's like been doing a lip syncs like almost every single week, right? So it's kind of like like I don't know Trinity will be the Katya the season. Well, she though yeah, I have a feeling like she has a good potential to win. I feel like and I don't know if I want that too. I feel like Manila my And just because having like a queen who's been on ya like involvement drag race so long and I was like as a brand thing. Yeah. Hmm. Well, so any last thoughts sorry.	0.0
I lost the my computer died. So I'm changing over to my phone for the chat room in black holes defense.	0.0
I just feel like the Beehive I thought they did great but I feel like they're like little little gimmicks overshadowed like they're emceeing a Lil Bit whereas I feel like black holes they did a great job of kind of incorporating their themes and their themes not overshadowing their emceeing I guess that's what I'm trying to say, but they did they both did great and so I'm glad either one of them would one so I'm happy with beehive wedding. So there I do think that the black hole was built on Monet and Monique's personalities and the be high was built more on the concept. So I totally I totally agree with you there.	1.0
You're all winners. You're all winners. the trophy	1.0
so any last thoughts on the main challenge before we move to the right absolutely do not. Okay. So Runway, what did you think of Roose outfit? I loved it. I really liked it. I love a good fuzzy arm.	1.0
I liked her hair. I like the fuzzy arm Lack of Color. I like the color. I think I'm gonna give my kudos to Rupaul this season because I think I think this is the I think this might be my favorite outfit RuPaul season of costumes. Yes, it's I don't know. It's put it on your calendar. Designer who makes sure that pink and blue is so harsh and you never liked clashes with the color that room wearing but it's still a bad on the eyes. Yeah.	1.0
It's so bright, but it's never like never class you so yes, so Runway the theme was Plastic Fantastic which was weird to me because I was like, why won't you have a be a club Kid theme is drive me crazy when the runway theme doesn't match the challenge right?	1.0
Although some of them were kind.	1.0
And of Club, yeah, some of them weren't likely chooses was very Club kitty. Yeah, so so we have the looks do yes.	1.0
Oh, yeah incoming all we brought us the look. I did my work the Lord's my chest. Okay. So the trees is the first one amazing.	1.0
She has like a very like plasticy Club kid outfit with balls coming out of her head and I understand the latex.	1.0
I believe it's Venus Venus latex or something like that.	1.0
But I agreed with Michelle when Michelle was like this is one of My favorite hands down done.	1.0
Yeah handsome for her. Yes for her. Yeah, because I was like, it was like, please don't be a pageant gown, right? I now when she said she's got her all-time favorite. Fun fact Loris from Dracula actually helped make this costumes.	1.0

I like all of them out of all that Jackie B.	1.0

I think it's giving me plenty To Wong Foo realness kind of we went to my least favorite. I have to say the hey I just was too there was too much and I know she's usually so so like spot-on. I just there was this things on the shoes and then the dress and then the head He's and then the earrings and I just wish it was just the dress and a simple shoe. I don't know.

All right, you know, I'm right. Yes, and why it was like yeah like a Miss Universe thing.	1.0

Yeah, and then, you know, it designed it where you know with the arms would have this disconnect. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Can you help me when I'm packing for ya 12. I'll meet you in the back home. I just I did I thought the same thing and I knew right away. That she wasn't as Colombia. I remembered that but my thing was why would you do it again? It's still I don't I get that it's not the same country. I'm not saying that I don't understand the Venezuelan Colombia are different countries. I'm just saying it's the same thing. It really is the same thing. You're putting on a sash and being a contestant from a Miss Universe Pageant for another. Yeah for the second time you're competing in the same show. So I like come up with something new. I just thought it was like I did you like it was like, but I like that release to be	0.0
Ali and I say have something nice to say about Valentina for once she's gone. She got eliminated. No, but like I like the metaphor of that like Miss Universe is very fake great pasta key, so I got that from that. So that's why I was here for it and she looked when she could have just came as herself.	1.0
Yeah. Well, I'm going to say this I take back everything I said if Ali likes it I must be saying it wrong. Next up is Mona and I will accept that Ali is right and I am I love that we have to that's what makes this conversation. So interesting. You know, I love it. I'm sitting in the middle of all of it.	1.0

Yeah again. Yeah, but did you look at the panties darker? She's wearing a darker brown. Yeah me for audio listeners and Ash Gray died.	1.0
That's funny because I have that. Hkh, and I didn't notice that it was just better than because Latrice is nude illusion. Put such a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of my life that I was like, I was like a Monet she's doing well is but here's the question is she doing a nude illusion or she just chewed chose a fabric that was that color.	0.0
You know what I mean? Like, I don't know that she was necessarily trying to do it illusion. I would just say, you know, it's statuesque or has a syllable. I'm referring to Latrice has thanked because I don't know that she was trying to do nude illusion. I think that was just the the colors that she chose like, I don't think that that's what they had in the band. Yeah. Exactly and sometimes you're working with this what's in the bin so she may have just been working with what was in the bin Monet her consistent Runway has always been this and I've seen it since episode one is the detail. Yeah. She has she has time like if you see this on the 4K that the shoulder Pat is completely Stone everything from head to toe is completely stoned no spots the details though. She had time. I'm she was waiting for it. This was another one that like Trinity that I was like, I like it. I don't love it. But I will say this I loved her makeup. I think that might be the best makeup. She's done seeing her is that she's not choking cares. Great. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah next was Monique and she she had I was not getting Josephine Baker from this.	0.0
I don't know something Baker to make are not I feel like the bananas. I got Chiquita. Banana. Yeah. Well the bananas with Manila meet leaders have like return them to her. Had most of them because they're missing on the back and they were in manila's basket on top and so they will share my banana bananas.	0.0
You know, I wish she like if she was going to do a Josephine Baker like she's wearing this like plastic during the wrong time and plastic bottom with bananas tape to it. It's just it doesn't look like Justin Baker to me.	0.0
It just looks like it looks like the Banana Boat Song but we all know we all have our bad days. Yeah. I ran into the brown cow studying this past week. Week and she's really sweet. Yeah, I was like hi. We talk shit about you. They usually no no, she wore brown cowboy hat. So I'm glad I know right?	1.0
I feel like her runways are getting a lot weaker as the competition progresses and I feel like someone in the chat brought this up, maybe the runways her and moan. Well, I like Monet's but I feel like her Runway brought maybe the decision why they didn't win black hole to as well so that contributed to that and I just very disappointed by Monique Monique's looks this season. I feel like Monet is has stronger.	0.0
Then make the season so I would wear I actually thought that she might end up in the bottom because of the look even though they did well in the challenge this was so bad. Like I like when she came around the corner. I was like are you freaking kidding me? I just I mean it was just it was just bad so bad and I love to somebody was like I like the finger wave hair, but it's like grow your stretching now when you're complimenting the wig nothing I was disappointed because	0.0
I actually do like her runways. I have like two runways this season. And so this to me was a huge disappointment because I was expecting something. Well, yeah, you're right. I was expecting something really really cool and I got a plastic banana skirt, especially since she's such a crafty Queen. Yeah. She's able to turn out a dress like in like, yeah.	0.0
All right exactly in the chat room that they keep hearing noodle illusion. Oh noodle. Times it's the noodle to say I'm coming in here and my product all little illusion. Wow.	1.0
So Latrice and Trinity were the top two likely deserves a little dick in the soup though, because I felt Manila should have been with them. Yeah, I would replace Trinity with Manila personally.	0.0
I wouldn't I thought they thought they deserved it and part of you know part of me wondered.	1.0
Like were they doing this to make Manila mad? So like the next episode?	0.0
Well, they weren't going to pin her against Latrice.	0.0
Yeah.	1.0
She just got back but I feel I felt bad for the tree species like, okay. What are we doing now? It's time for my time, too. Fine, you're gonna be doing a group challenge. She's like Fuck. This is why I would home the first time not going to let it happen again.	0.0
So Latrice chose Valentina. Do you guys agree with her choice?	1.0
Yes. Yes. Yes.	1.0
She has like the team she held back Naomi and I felt bad like see you just didn't contribute but she thinks she said, you know, I didn't do anything make sure that we look sickening and that's surprising you think Valentina being very her ego. She would have taken over the	0.0
Challenger maybe, but Naomi had to do it and you wouldn't think Naomi is like this like top Valentina is the girl who does nothing at the school project will put her name on them. So I was like perfectly. I just I felt like she when she was talking to both of them. I felt like in her head. She I mean we all know she lives in her own world, but I feel like she thought they're not going to send me home because of her relationship with them and because In her head she deserves to be in the finale that being said anybody, you know, it's like you can say that but then you can't say that Latrice can't think the same thing because that was the issue before was that Latrice is like why I've been around a long time. I deserve to be here. I shouldn't have gone home. Then you can't be mad. You didn't mean does that make sense? Well, thank you can't be mad at me choose for saying it and then B and then be okay with Valentina going we are well I shouldn't be because I'm fabulous well. Latrice is fabulous. I'm sorry Sheila made herself. I think yeah, absolutely. She said absolutely I didn't do anything. Yeah, we'll go. Well and even when she says give me a reason to keep you. She just said do what you think is best and I think that in when I heard that I went she thinks you're not going to send her home. So she's just telling you to do what you need is a great social player because she said yourself a few times. Yeah, but you know, the third time really wasn't her child in her favor. She wouldn't last one Survivor.	0.0
Yeah. So the lip sync was you spin me round and Sorry, but usually Latrice it if you know you're going up against latrese you have to do at Trinity did right so you have to bring a gimmick because Latrice is going to slay a lip-sync. I was laughing so hard at Trinity that I felt like she didn't win. I see I see that was thicken the soup to me because I'm like, I feel like she should have won because it was so funny.	1.0
I love the trees.	1.0
I love my Teresa girl, but she also she should have lost her wearing those boots again.	0.0
She wore them a gift. She wore those boots from the	1.0
The not nude illusion nude illusion, but that's a lot about a queen - rely on a gimmick in order to defeat another good. Yeah, thank you so much.	1.0
I didn't like the I didn't like driving that same thing last year and one she was blue for her finale. Look I know what you know, so y'all are being somebody's Queens over here.	1.0
I was team Katya first and foremost for All-Stars to it's a gimmick Queen though like I love Katya, but that's what she does. Oh my God. I'm sorry.	0.0
Yeah, we're back to let's play it even feel when it comes to all 124 Queen like a Pokemon. So yeah, it's know. I don't know. I didn't think that I don't understand why she didn't win. It was funny. I just don't think it matched the song. I think if it was a different song that it went with it would have won. I just it didn't make sense as soon as soon as she came out. I get that she was trying to do something different and show a different side of Trinity, which is fine. Fine, and I you know, and I encourage it but it should have been done with it. Just it didn't make sense for the song. It really truly didn't I mean if you can explain it to me and justify it I will take everything that I'm saying right now back, but you can't because it didn't fit the song. She didn't even like this in her 20s, at least she was in just in a dance costume and she just danced and she roll at least she rolled on the floor when they said you spin me right round like it made slack. I'm not saying it was phenomenal, but it just didn't it didn't work for me.	0.0
That's just money. It first with the floppy tits. Yeah, you know, so I don't know. I just didn't care for it at all. Just I felt like it was reaching I didn't read it or I didn't like it. She was like cringing. Yeah, so read or just doesn't appreciate well label humor. Yeah.	0.0
So there I will say this other this also is like it's like it for me. It's just like that standard joke. Let's take off the robe and have saggy boobs. You know, I mean, like I just really like I'm not saying everybody does it but I'm just saying like exactly what I'm talking about. It's just like it's kind of like that. I always used to say when I started doing drag I felt like every time I would go to drag shows before I see drag drag queens would do something and pull out a dildo and I remember starting to do dragon go I will do drag but I'm never bringing a dildo on stage like it was just like I was so tired of seeing it and again, I'm not saying, you know, you just brought up one person who did something similar to that. We've seen stuff like this before it's not new and creative had it been new and creative and fit the song. I would be all for it a hundred percent behind it. It just didn't make sense with the song. I just felt like she was reaching in trying to win the challenge which is the point you're trying to win the challenge. She reached into her bag of tricks and said I'm going to try this and see if it works and it well. I think that Trinity was giving her season 9 like reference but she was doing the Charlie hides. Yeah the whole pining and I thought I was funny. Yeah. Mmm, I didn't catch that. She should have just this Charlie heights. Yeah, well You just as try. Haha. That's funny.	0.0

Hello and welcome to episode 5 of The Fan into flame podcast. I'm your host as always Tyler warfel. Thanks for coming back and listening to another episode on this episode. We're going to give our season recap of the Fall Sports season, which were tremendous really historic seasons for our volleyball and soccer teams. We interview the soccer Captain's Christian Josh and Auggie. We also interview the volleyball seniors Amanda and Renee. We did have a slight audio malfunction during the soccer interview in my iPad fell over but we decided to just roll. That starting with soccer the boys won the dvcac championship for the second straight year by beating Chestertown again this time by a score of 3 to 2. In my opinion. This was the best of the Championships since we've been back in the dvcac the last four years. We've played Chestertown each of those four years. The first year was 2016 and we'd split with them in the regular season. I kind of thought we were the better team Alex scored an early goal in that game, but Chestertown scored to kind of flew key goals. The first one was just kind of a bad mistake barkeeper. / and the second one was a little controversial in that it was a long shot from near the corner. It looked like the ball might have gone out of bounds in the air and then come back in regardless. It was enough to give Chestertown a 2-1 win the next year in 2017. I don't think there's a question that we were the better team. We had beaten them for 1 and 5 3 in the regular season, but the game got kind of ugly there were lots of fouls going around the final score ended up being 4-3 in overtime. But three of the goals were scored on penalty kicks to from us and one. Them there just wasn't really a good flow to the game which in my opinion gave Chestertown the advantage in that game and to their credit. They took advantage in one in overtime last year, even though the final score was two to one. I feel like we kind of dominated the game Chestertown scored late to make it a one goal game. But as a fan at least it didn't really ever feel like we're going to lose. It was a great atmosphere great environment IDE Turf a lot of fans a night game under the lights great atmosphere, but we scored early and pretty much control the play. Why this year was different? Like I said from a fan perspective. I think this was the best game. I think the teams were very evenly matched. They both played. Well Augie scored in about the 10th minute to give GMS a one nothing lead, but Chestertown pressed up and scored a nice goal about 15 minutes later the tied at 1-1 and it looked like they really had the momentum at that point heading into halftime and looked like we kind of needed to regroup but right before halftime Augie worked a little magic. You dribble between a handful of Chestertown Defenders and scored about a minute. With a half-time whistle to give GMS a two to one lead. That was a huge goal to get the momentum back on our side but Chestertown came out in the second half continue to press continued to play well and they found another equalizer with probably about 25 minutes left in the game. They got a long throw in from either Corner found an unmarked man for a header to tie the game at 2-2, but with 10 or 15 minutes left Auggie again dribbled past a few Defenders got into the box and got tackled from behind for a penalty kick which he converted pretty easily in the To the upper left corner, and that would be the final score it ended three two, there were some nervous moments at the end Chestertown kept attacking and had several good chances, especially on set pieces and Corner kicks, but our defense held on Christian had a really strong game. David was really good in gold and I think you had other Defender step up and play well and not make mistakes. I thought between Austin and Kobe and I thought Adam and Cody did a good job, too of not making any defensive errors. There were a few Corner kicks that were a little worried. With Chestertown players that were unmarked but overall the defense gave a really good performance. So it was a really exciting game. We had a lot of fans support despite the fact that it was a Saturday afternoon on the day of the Fall auction and not a very short drive up to bear. So it was a good day for GM s soccer a great way to end a really good season boys finished with an overall record of 13 wins one loss and 1 tie this season. They were 9 and 1 in conference play and obviously dvcac soccer overall. Is not the highest level of play, but I think it's improving and there weren't as many blowouts this year as in the past couple of years Chestertown Calvary and Faith Baptist were all pretty competitive. But in the three non conference games, we went to wins and 1 tie combine this year and last year and you have a two year record of 29 wins one loss into ties with to conference championships. That's really impressive and it's actually the best two-year run in GMS soccer history, and I think it just speaks to the job. Mr. Bechtel has On as a coach in building a program and there's been some really talented soccer players the last several years and some of that have been kind of unexpected. You know, Alex Augie and Christian all transferred to GMS for high school and didn't go here during elementary and middle school. So it's always nice to be able to add that level of ability into your program when you don't necessarily see that coming from the Middle School team. Then you also have Caleb and Joshua Lee who are also very talented soccer players that have been at GMS since kindergarten and throw in David Mendez into that mix too. But what's impressive about what the soccer program is a right now is that you get a lot of production from guys. You wouldn't necessarily consider themselves soccer players. You can see the Improvement of skills year by year from guys like Kobe and Ryan and Carson and Adam guys. It didn't really grow up playing soccer. But Mr. Bechtel gets the best out of them and to me that's the sign of a program that's here to stay and speaking of that. This is this team has no seniors. So they'll return to everyone from a team that just had Tremendous season to look for another big year and in our leg there aren't a lot of seniors Chestertown only graduates to Calvary just one and Faith Baptist doesn't have any seniors either so look for next year to be a really competitive year in the dvcac and I know that like worship rep who's kind of the top dog in the easyacc has seen some of our scores last couple of years. They want to play us next year. So next year could be a lot of fun for our soccer team will wrap up soccer with some awards because we've placed first in the regular season. Mr. Bechtell got to select seven of his players to play in the dvcac All-Star Game this year Junior's Augie Pacheco Christian quillin, Austin, swartzentruber Carson UNC and Josh Willie were selected along with sophomore David Mendez and freshman Nevin Yahtzee for Christian and Josh. It was their third All-Star selection for Austin for Augie. It was his second and for Austin Carson David and Nevin, this was their first time playing in the game Augie Christian Josh and Devon were additionally named to the all-conference. The team which is the best 11 in the conference and that's a really high honored to be named that team. We have posters that we make for the all-conference players. They'll be hung up at school sometime in the coming days. Augie was given medals for being the leading goal scorer and the leader in assists in the conference during the regular season and Josh was given one for leading in assists. He and Augie tied Atop The League for most assists a few other statistical leaders that weren't recognized at the All-Star games, but just throw these out there David Mendez was six in the league in goals. With seven which is impressive because he mostly plays goalie. Christian quillin was seventh in assists with for Carson Yahtzee with 18 goals with 6th and 10th and assist with three Nevin Yahtzee was 7th and assist with for and 11th in goals with four and then obviously all he led the league in both goals and assists 21 goals 11 assists and that's just in conference play Josh tied for first in assist with 11 and was 16 goals with seven. So that's a wrap on soccer. Make sure to come back next year and watch Team that we return everyone and some exciting things could be happening next year for our soccer team Auggie is just two goals away from becoming just the eighth player in GMS history to score 50 or more goals and Josh is just one assist away from joining Auggie in the 25 assist Club. Joshua be the seventh player in program history to have 25 or more assists look for that early in the season. All right. I'm joined Now by Christian. Hey, Josh and Auggie captains of the soccer team. You guys had a great season last year you had two of the all-time greats here Alex you leading assist of all time and EMS history killed the leading goal scorer all time. You lost them to graduate from last year and yet you still managed to have a great season. What did you have to do this season to make up for the losses of those two guys.	1.0
We really had to start playing. The team and not relying on two players to just bail us out every time we needed the strength or the courage to win a game.	1.0
So so you go into the championship game playing Chestertown for the fourth straight year for you guys Josh and cushions your third year. I'll be your second. How does it feel to play the same team Chestertown year after year in the championship with the preparation? Like for that really what I do before I play chess town.	1.0
I just	1.0
get mentally prepared and knowing that they're if they usually have a strong team that we play against and I mean it would be I guess it would be good for to play somebody else in the championship.	1.0
But I always look forward to playing chess town and Championship.	1.0
So score was 1:1 towards the end of the first half and Josh something happened in the box there didn't look like it was a ton of contact, but you went down and were down for a while with an injury and I can tell you standing next to You your parents and other people on the sidelines there were some worried people over on the sidelines both one for your health. But also then if you couldn't return that would be a big loss for the team can tell us about what happened there. And yeah, so basically like this kid earlier on the game he went for like a slide tackle and that's when I went down on my shoulder. Like that's when it started to hurt a lot and then later on another kid like hit me in the shoulder and that's when I went down in the box. So so you set off for the rest of the Half did come back in the second half and then I don't know 15 minutes, maybe into the second half you took a shot from just outside the box that the fans over on our side line were ready to cheer and explode in excitement and then it hit the crossbar. So what were you thinking on that chat do you think was going in? I thought I was going to go in because I put like I hit a knuckleball and it was moving and the keeper couldn't do much. I felt bad. Yeah, I was gonna ask you. What was your feeling when it crossbar pretty bad? Yeah. Thankfully we were able to still maintain our composure there and then Auggie you got a penalty kick late in the game there then end up being the game-winner. There were some Chestertown fans and the calvary players and some of their fans to kind of yelling at the keeper trying to give them instructions as to which way you were going to go. Did you hear them at all? What were you thinking when you stepped up to the Penalty spot there?	1.0
The first thing that came to my head is we should I kick it because I could hear everybody shouting he's gone, right?	0.0
He's gonna write their players were shot in his own rights on him to go right but I was calling my name is on make it and I went I stuck to my plan and I made it. How did it feel after you made it good? That's like the best feeling. Yeah. Yeah. All right guys. Well, thanks for coming on and hope you have a good offseason and be ready to back go back again next year. Oh right on the volleyball side of things what a season for the girls coming into the year. The focus really was on everyone that graduated the girls return just two players from last year. And the question was could the young players on this team play well enough to compete at the varsity level. There was obviously some talent but what it translate to Varsity the first year and the answer ended up being a very definitive. Yes, the girls went 12 and 2 and won their first dvcac championship since 2004 15 years ago. Oh, that's a long time and this wasn't like soccer because the boys had been there the last several years and they were kind of expected to be back in the championship for the girls. This was kind of Uncharted Territory. And as I was standing there watching the consolation game before the championship the girls looked like they were locked in and ready now hindsight is always 20/20, but they looked like a team that was ready to go win a championship and it showed right from the start of the game. They just look like they were much more prepared to play in a game of this magnitude than their opponent was they won. The first game 25:21 and pretty much Controlled it the whole way. It just never felt like Chestertown could get any momentum going in that first set. And the thing is we made a lot of serving errors. I'm not sure the exact number in the first set but we made 13 serving errors overall. That's a lot. So if you take away those serving errors, this was a complete domination in the first little bit of the game. That was the only way Chestertown with scoring. We were doing everything else better than them. And after that first win the girls came out with a lot of energy momentum and were dominating the second set. I think it was like 16 to 7 when Chester town called a timeout and coming out of the timeout they were able to regroup and start to play their game a little bit. They came all the way back and we're within 24 23 and they were serving the ball and they served it out of bounds and gifted us that last point for a 25-23 win. And now it was to nothing the last set started off poorly for GMS Chestertown. Got an early lead in maintain that for a long time. It felt like our girls maybe it just taking their foot off the gas a little bit. They just weren't as crisp with their And their hits as they had been in the first two sets, but they got a timeout refocused eventually took their first lead at 17 16 and then didn't look back with a score of 2421 Chester town called their final timeout, but it didn't help Amber Humphries served up an ace For the Win. It was a very exciting moment for the girls as they celebrated their well-deserved Championship. So really the question for this season was how do you go from losing almost your entire team the year before including two All-Stars and one all-conference player and Glee start brand new in win a championship with that team and I think a big part of that is good coaching the coaches recognize where their strengths and weaknesses were and put girls in positions where they could use those strengths and not have to do things. They couldn't do and coaching is great. But ultimately it comes down to the players on the court and you had two freshmen coming this year who were very good hitters and Amber and Kailyn and so you wanted to get them hitting as much as you can and in order for them to be able to hit you need good sets and Riley will pretty much give you a good set every single time even if she The bad path she's going to set her hitters up with a quality opportunity for a kill the strategy is if you can get Riley setting the Amber and killing as much as possible. You're going to be in good shape. Not a lot of teams in our league have three players as good as those three and it showed in the championship game and then aside from those three, you want your other three players on the court to be able to minimize mistakes and make the easy plays you want them to be able to dig when needed give Riley a good pass for a set. You want them to build a serve well and not make a lot of serving errors and I think they did that between Amanda Renee. Elsie and Emily you got solid role players that allowed the team to succeed they knew their jobs and they performed them well, and I think this team really showed what good teamwork can do for the success of a team in any sport not everyone's going to play the same role on the team. Some players are going to get more action more hits more shots, whatever it may be and the players need to recognize their role and buy into it for a team to be successful and the girls did that a lot of that's on the coaches to put them in those roles and make sure the players clearly understand their roles and in my opinion, that's Made this team great and weren't that tall? In fact, there are high school volleyball team. They would be probably considered short. So when you watch them play, it's not like a jump out at you right away, but they just worked really well together and understood their roles and brought home a banner to hang in the gym and the future looks very bright for GMS volleyball Riley's just a sophomore Kailyn and Amber are freshmen Emily and Kelsey are freshmen you lose to girls abandon Renee and you'll need to replace them. They played well, but there are some quality players coming up for the Middle School ranks next year and I think you're looking potentially at another really good year and I think I think they should be the favorites in the league heading into next season a few Awards to recognize here for volleyball Kaelyn Amber Riley and Amanda were all chosen to play in the dvcac All-Star Game. Amber was second in the league in Aces with 43 and forth in kills with 82 Riley led the league in assist with 172 and she led an Aces as well with 45 and second place for us. This was 78 so that each shows what a wide margin. She led a sister. She had a hundred seventy two second was 78 Kelsey was 19th. And Aces with 12. Amanda was ninth in Aces with 18 and Calum was first in kills with 125 forth in Aces with 31 and seventh in blocks with seven. There was a little bit of controversy with the volleyball All Conference team when the teams were first announced that the All-Star Game a couple of weeks ago. Kalyn was named all-conference and she was the only one from GMS to be named all-conference. They chose six players that night to be recognized as all-conference members now, they got it wrong. There was some miscommunication there there should have actually been eight players selected for that team. And so what happened is the His went back and re voted for two more players to be added to the all-conference team. And when they did that both Amber and Riley were selected. And so we ended up with three All Conference members Kalin Amber and Riley. I do think it's kind of absurd that Riley especially was not named all-conference originally in the top six. I think if you look at both the stats that she put up and just watch her play. You would know that. That she definitely is one of the six best players in the league and maybe could make the case that she's the most important player in the entire league. If you look at again her assist numbers 172 assist compared to second place with 78. She led the league in Aces as well. I think that she should have been on that top 6, but regardless they got it, right eventually her and Amber were also named to the all-conference team. So congratulations to those three. Kaelan, Riley and Amber. All right. I'm joined Now by Renee and Amanda. Hi, so you guys did not play volleyball last year. You decided to play this year for your senior year all in all. Are you glad you played?	1.0
Yeah. I'm actually very glad I played I feel like it was a really good experience and it was a lot of fun to play. It was something new from you try and I really enjoyed it. How about you Amanda? It was a lot of fun playing with like all the girls like the freshmen especially because I've never gotten to know them very well. Like kayln and Amber and Kelsey and all them this want to play with them and just have that experience.	1.0
So talking about the championship game. Now, what was your mindset like going into the game where you nervous or excited where you calm? Sorry Amanda?	1.0
I was really excited. I was kind of nervous because it was against Chestertown and they had beaten us before but I knew that we could get them and I had a Chick-fil-A Sandwich before the game. So that really helped	1.0
You want to add anything to that Renee or I mean personally, I was like really nervous.	0.0
But yet at the same time. I was like really ready to go.	1.0
Like get the game over with kind of did it make any difference that you were playing Chestertown and not someone else because you for one lost to them in the championship in basketball last year and had split with them in the regular season.	0.0
I thought that it made a big difference because I remember basketball season last year that championship game was really brutal and we all really wanted it because we had beaten them before.	1.0
So after you got the final point to win the championship, how did that feel	1.0
it was pretty great. Like I've never really felt that way before it was like probably one of the greatest feelings I've ever felt. Yeah. It was really cool because like the volleyball team Adam wanted 15 years and it's like a big milestone just to win again and like I haven't done like a basketball like we haven't won the basketball championship or anything. So it was just really cool.	1.0
So, how's Basketball going? Are you going to win a championship this year that it was so I think we have a chance.	1.0
We have some really good players. We're short but like in volleyball, but you still want to see if you have fire though. Yeah. Alright.	1.0

Hey, mr. Waffle.	1.0
If you want us to Roger Waters, he would tell you that this particular album.	1.0
Well, it marked the end of the band Pink Floyd incredibly contemporary. It sounds just as good now as what it did back then wish you were here the 9th album from Pink Floyd according to Roger Waters Mark the end of the band. However, another one was to come of course namely the wall a beautiful Masterpiece as well. But on this occasion, it's wish you were here and there's a good reason for it. This particular album was when Roger Waters set himself up to be solely the bandleader dismissing a lot of Dave Gilmore's incursions Nick Mason's as well as Richard Wright. It was at the time a real Roger Waters trademark, and that's what Pink Floyd was fast becoming Dave Gilmore's vocals on wish you were here. I think arguably sizes up the salty sweet. Nation of what was the relationship between waters and Gilmour the way that he sung it there's a debate whether or not wish you were here is actually one of the highest performing songs by buskers and artists alike a favorite performed on acoustic guitar. If you go to any Pub on a Sunday afternoon, it's likely that you hear the song performed some better than others. How could a slow song such as wish you were here? How could Contemporary ballad if you like become such a pillar of the face of rock and roll well meaning the whole meaning not just the way it's written what was written but how it was performed how it was sung. There's a distinctive note a pairing and it certainly comes across on this album. And on the track when Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd was released. It went straight to the top of the It's on both sides of the Atlantic. It's sold over 14 million copies just within 12 months. I mean this was going to be a smash no matter what the album itself has. The cover has a man in flames and the other one shaking his hand as you know back then it was actually done. He actually lit himself on fire and shook the guy's hand and then they had to extinguish him. But get this they couldn't do it. Just once they had to do it a few times to get the the right shot. It's just something that was needed at the time. And this was Artistry going in a New Direction actual photographs of people doing this kind of thing. It was a Telltale sign of the stories to follow especially with the wall. That was forthcoming Richard Wright of Pink Floyd later said that this was without a doubt his favorite album. Actually. It's a lot of people's favorite album for many reasons the songs on it are immeasurable just beautiful tracks back to back so So enjoy it if you haven't heard it and if you do have it just pick up that volume turned up to ten on a Saturday night, you know do what you need to do to feel the way that you do and enjoy one of the finest albums and one of the world's best rock albums ever met. Well, that's it for today's show was almost perfect. Wasn't it? You know bearing the 30 or 40 remarkably obvious mistakes.	1.0
I thought was pretty good until next.	1.0

We agreed to do it last weekend and then just didn't happen. I forgot you forgot. Okay, bye didn't like maliciously forget. I didn't I like plead the fifth like I don't remember.	0.0
Yeah. Okay. I was busy as well.	1.0
I was I think we were both streaming.	1.0
Yeah, and that's the thing. You know, it's not that like here's a here's my justification. It's not that like we avoid doing the podcast but it's so easy to just keep doing what you're doing. You know, what's what what stays in motion this is what's the phrase the motion of the ocean keeps blowing? Okay, not the phrase I was thinking of is that is the worst quote I've ever heard.	1.0
No, it's it was a what's what starts in motion stays in the fleet.	1.0
Okay, you're just saying quotes down, but it's just so you know if we're streaming it's just so much easier just to keep Did the fault is it the fault is shared would you agree?	1.0
It's about you and I thank you so much Counter-Strike. Yeah, what a good time to be a Counter Strike fear into operation hits the operation comes out today.	1.0
And did you did you didn't play it dude? I was at work. Yeah, unfortunately not. I saw you as making game though.	1.0
Let me just like rattle off a list of things that God changed. Okay, they buffed the farmers and Galil spray. So the spray is tighter. It's not this different pattern what I didn't know that far. Thomas is $2,000. The glial is $1,800. They're both $200 off on sale special. Whoa, then they added a 16 weeks pass where you can unlock different price tiers kind of like Fortnight the exact same way they set up battle pass in Fortnight, which is just a good system. It's just extra content free cases and stuff like that. Then they added skins for the models in your game. So they added all like different like kind of better looking models to the game. And even though the game's first person they So added a screen at the end that gives you accolades for different things that you did best during the game. So if you had like a highest ATR most headshots or whatever you'll all be on display for your team to see and then they will show you liked what you were actually best at so like utility damage or Flash assists or ADR and then you get there. There's where you get to see the the Skins as well. I'm trying not to reach out right now and then they also added three new cases for new knife skins. Or for new knives with all of the same all the skins and then they added new map to scrimmage mapped as was is just made by like a community mapper. They had a like some Scouts knives math.	1.0
They added added so much shit dude it so it's a game perfect now, I mean, it sounds perfect.	1.0
Do they Nerf the Creed they they added three hundred dollars to the creek. So it's back to three thousand dollars and it's the exact same so I think that's good though. I think that's really good.	1.0
Yeah. It's at least like for the first time like viable, I think people forget.	1.0
No be used to buy the Krieg again ever that's it goes to price where people could practice with in real matches and they finally got good with it and put the price back up. So it's still worth buying but now like you don't want it, like people will expect to Krieg nerve to be like you just need to get basically volt this gun put it into a position where no one sees it anymore. Then the game will be fixed. So everyone can use a case. That's not what valve want and they are trying to see if there's a world where you can use both guns situationally it It'll be it'll be a bit better to have a creek but not too much that it ruins the game. Maybe the I think putting the price back up was like in general what most people thought would be a good idea. So yeah. Yeah, so I think I think it's a good idea, but that's sick and then didn't cash.	0.0
Do you imagine cash moving to mmmm as well? Like now cash an official map?	1.0
Oh, yeah. Nice. That's cheesy like FM phones up like worried to be like always worried about what what's going to happen with this Maps because I don't think valve communicate that well. With the mappers and people who get their Maps included in the game or anyone for that matter. So I think it's a probably a sigh of relief for him who I'm sure it does a lot of this stuff by himself without even talking about like for example with a simple graffiti that's on cash under Heaven on be site. He did that himself. It's not it's not actually a major a major moment graffiti by Valve. It's a graffiti. He added by himself picking up from from the major.	1.0
That's that's crazy. He like I feel like like what an update this is this would you sit like this is like Monumental, right? It's like almost two gigs, which is which is a wild. What's the next update isn't the game perfect.	1.0
Now, we've made just thinking like what's the next doesn't like this small thing that was the creek and now it's like sick and they even like added a reason to buy the Galil and Farmers. I think the only thing is the Gloom forms are really sick now like I just played him in mmm where I spent the entirety side only buying khalil's no other Guns and it's $1,800 now sand. It's actually like deals just as good as neikei even better. So so that's a little bit of a problem because it's like $1,000 less. Yeah. I don't know what you do. It's good. Isn't it? Good, right.	1.0
I feel like now it's just infrastructure right now. It's like tournaments now. It's like making maybe matchmaking more viable taking the cheaters out. I know that's been a big problem for a while.	1.0
Now. I feel like I think it do you agree that the the the there's it feels like there's more cheaters and matchmaking right now. Yeah. Oh for sure.	1.0
I don't know what it is. Why don't they come in waves? It must be like hack a launch like they're just like launched a new hack or something and I did together. But yeah right now it feels like it's like a really bad time to matchmake.	0.0
Yeah, it's strange for a while. I trust matchmaking felt pretty stable and like right now it doesn't so, yeah, it's super weird.	1.0
Yeah, it does come in waves, but I mean, I hope I mean a lot of people hope that there's like 1:28 tick servers in the next coming, you know.	1.0
The next coming up - bye. Mrs. Shaw because 64 tick no honestly. No, I don't either. I don't think I like a lot of the stuff. I learned about movement to make 64 tick interesting like even more interesting like there are certain pixel Ledges and stuff that you can't stand on in 128. You can stand on 64. There's also doors open faster on 64, so I didn't know that aids are all throw differently than be hopping is not worse or better. It's just different right? Yeah. So there's like a lots of things out. Ali really like about 164 tick and when it comes to the shooting, I mean it feels different but not like objectively worse.	0.0
Yeah. No, I think it is worse. I think like the shooting feels worse like coming from like on client to 64. I think you can it's a noticeable different if you play a lot on client, but yeah in terms of movement stuff, I think it's like so my new and I don't think and maybe this is like a contrarian view. I don't think the right move is to move everything to 128 take like, I don't think that's smart. I think it's like right there.	0.0
You know, they don't make enough money to do something.	0.0
No, you know there and it appeals like look at Fortnight. It works because it appeals to like most kidding.	0.0
They do make enough money to do something like that squeak.	1.0
No, but they could hold on we do no, no, no, but even just because they can doesn't mean they should like I just feel like they're what do they say most most complain? I have my see those computers that play Counter-Strike may not be able to take advantage of 128 take, you know, like stuff like that that we don't think about Out, you know, I think I think there must their time could be used more effectively. In other areas of the game. Wouldn't you agree?	0.0
Like we have like 20 knives now?	1.0
Yeah fuck knives. Can I just I don't care. I don't care about scans are talking about knives. Okay.	1.0
Well, some of us aren't broke boys that we can get guys we want. Oh shit test out the new skin.	0.0
No, dude, honestly fuck scans, but what I'm saying is like what if Lana's can I pitch something to you for like an interview? Pretend like you're a Gabe Newell get into character get really into it. Okay what he sounds like. This enables God.	0.0
What are you doing here?	1.0
My God, it's the orc from Warcraft that he is incapable still kill. So what did you buy it? Okay, I have an idea. Mr. Mr. Newell. I have an idea. Yeah speak what if there was solo ranks, but also team-based rank in matchmaking so you can have a matchmaking, but I do miss Turner. Keep your pants on no, I'm wouldn't be sick though. I mean then it would be like because the big issue is now like we're we're sort of incentivizing Gamers to play Four frags, but the way to incentivize Gamers to play for actually in roles for teams to win is to reward teams, you know, so if you stick with the core group of five and you have a team ranked right versus an individual rank, it aligns incentives to play better Counter-Strike collectively for	1.0
Has individually yeah, they have a team-based and so they have different in every like all other games like League of Legends and DOTA. We have her solo MMR and then you have Team MMR say go don't know why they don't have it.	1.0
Yeah, right but been for years but long as it's been an issue for ever like even esea pluggers, like I know like the legendary pluggers and esea that were just so sick and you brought you you and I probably can name off a few but yeah, but what happens is a lot of times those buggers can't perform in a team. If so, specialized their skill and pugs that they're so good at like go mid up every round exactly but we don't want that to happen. We want people to effectively put him to put be put into a roll. So I think that would solve a lot and so that's my idea and I think I fuck it. I'll pitch it then we gave me.	1.0
I think the only reason you don't do that in games is if you segregate matchmaking too much then it takes too long to find cues. That's true. I don't know. I don't know if that's a problem for Counter Strike. It's like one of the biggest games right now. We just hit our sixth highest peak. And that's like really high as like 650,000 concurrent players. Oh shit. So after the operation like no like a couple weeks ago. Oh shit for almost no reason which is awesome. So it feels like people are coming back and maybe new people are coming in. And yeah, I mean, there's probably a bunch of people that are like the you know, the more they play and they just started you're going to get hooked. Yeah Counter-Strike. It's a grill you will if you like FPS titles and then you're going to start buying the mouse pads specialized mouse pads with the Stitch edges. Oh rubberized bottom coding with this one side smooth one side speed one side control. You got the guns like mice with the with the you have the light like 90 Graham. Yeah ever G-Force fucking you can't even name wild dude and then you got like I got the keyboard that has blank blank keys. He's gamer mode.	1.0
You don't even need to know what you're looking every yeah. Yeah you got gamer do as well.	0.0
And then what you going to do you've invested already at that point $345. I'm not going to just turn around and play some stupid game. That's not going to use all of those things all of those all of your facilities to the maximum capacity and you get the get the monitor. Yeah, you're alone. You're locked in the six consoles.	0.0
Yeah don't like six consoles. You know, it was speaking speaking of stupid games. I don't maximize all of your gamer Hardware you and I have a game in common. Now that we've been playing Star Wars. Okay, Jedi Fallen Masters order, which is crazy dude. I listened. I was a perched atop a rooftop singing my songs about this game before it came out. I was like, oh man, this is gonna be a Souls like game. It's gonna be so good emeralds like show dope squeaks you idiot you Boomer go eat cauliflower within you. Okay. I get it high voice. I'm still waiting for puberty know so but now look at it man. It's so fun. And it's so good dude.	0.0
It's fucking nuts. It's so good. Cause all the cutscenes and the camera the camera eat like the action camera like one of the most underrated aspects like in Smash Bros. Melee, but they made a lot of clones one thing that was brought up. That was like this really kind of salient point from one of my viewers was just that it's the camera secretly that makes the game so much fun. Like it's not it's like it feels like someone's holding it and following you around and that like kind of like that feeling that it's like more lives at helped so much the camera and this game is so good when they switch from cutscenes to like when you're in different environments if it's like rumbly or whatever. It's such a good camera. So smooth always where you need it to be it's never annoying to deal with with and even though there's like a vertical layers to the map. You don't have to like look you don't like look up too hard. Yeah someone it's so it's so well done. It feels like the whole thing feels extremely linear, but then there's so much to explore so I it's just like got everything so far. Yeah. It's only thing that would fuck it up for me is not enough boss fights or Too Short at this point because Titanfall 2 is really short, right?	0.0
Yeah. Well this your it's going to take you about 20 hours or so, I think yeah, I mean Yeah, what's crazy? What about the camera in particular? I remember and you probably remember to in Dark Souls 3 the camera of when they're you're like facing two bosses was always kind of annoying and I was like, well, I don't know how I'd fix it. You know like this is what are you supposed to do if there's to moving objects that you're supposed to keep on the screen. It's kind of impossible to fix but then this game for some reason it doesn't have that same issue. And even though there's like seven or eight enemies on the screen for some reason. I don't think about it. It's almost as if like the game was made with the intention of the camera as well, you know, like as a mechanic versus like making a level making a boss and then having a camera there like that's sort of what Dark Souls kind of fell into but it's true.	1.0
Yeah, there's a joke in Dark Souls when you play against nameless King that like the first part with a big dragon that's like considered the camera boss. Yeah fight is basically just making sure you stay stabilized. That's kind of dumb. So, it's cool. Yeah, and yeah, it's the level design. And it's the graphics look so good too. And like I'm not going to play a lot of games. I have good graphics because I'm immediately like so there they spent all their money on this. Yeah, you know, they didn't do something else but was respawn. You know, it's going to look good. It's going to feel good. It's going to have great like probably great voice acting and then also it's going to have a lot of depth in terms of like the variety of things that you do like sometimes for a very good with vehicles. Like the things that you ride or the ice sliding thing and while running your in the what the what's like the big like garbage truck looking thing that you drive sometimes what garbage truck?	1.0
I'm so offended.	0.0
I'm just biting my mean it's like that a giant tractor fucking with an 80 80.	0.0
Yeah, AT&T you like my mom trying to relate to me.	1.0
Okay. Yeah, like even that just like really cool fun that fun. Do and they have to practice with Titanfall 2 to track area.	1.0
It's a tractor. No, but like the big the core of this game. This is what was so important and what I was scared of which I think is easy to fall into for a game like this is that it takes itself. So seriously, and it doesn't have the gameplay to support it. Do you know what I mean? Like here? I can't tell what's more interesting like the graphics and everything going on or the gameplay? Because if you just have Graphics it's like just eating whipped cream, you know versus like having the gameplay behind it. There's like A cake there that's enjoyable to yeah, you know what? I mean? It's like you need cake you need cake before you put on the process might like to I don't know too sweet. I couldn't think of another example. Okay. How about this? Let's rewind rewind rewind it's like having a chassis of a car but no engine, you know, like a lot of games fall into this, you know where it looks really nice and I just like Wolfenstein falls into this. I think a lot of other games I can't think of but like games like Wolfenstein basically they look so nice and they have like really cool vibe to it. But then underneath the gameplay gets repetitive and is boring but it seems like with respawn there. They always put mechanics and gameplay first and then everything is periphery which adds to it.	0.0
Like if the graphics were just near the periphery shit the periphery that all looks sick.	0.0
It looks so good. It's it adds to it. You know it like even if Graphics were shittier launders, I would still enjoy	1.0
Boomer rhetoric by the way, what do you mean Vibe and said why how's it surviving man is Cool vibe?	1.0
Not a sick thing to say.	0.0
We're trying to include chat now, so people will be incentivized to come to the live stream at twitch.tv slash lunders second plug podcast.	1.0
We're already there Swiss dot TV.	1.0

Yeah. Well, I'm gonna beat this game and I hope you do too unlike Secura, which I won't bring up. But here we are.	1.0
Get more than secular. Oh, what do you like it?	1.0
Where the second row if it wasn't Star Wars that is a hard question that takes a lot of introspection.	1.0
Yeah. Well, this is a whole. How much do you like the story? Where what is the story? Where is this story in like inside of Star Wars?	1.0
Where is it or like what time so this takes place after episode 3 in before episode 4. So this is I won't spoil anything anyone is listening. But this takes place after Order 66 where all of the Sith are all of the Empire basically. Is and kills all the Jedi all the Younglings if you remember all the kids and everything and so now you are the main character Cal who survived Order 66 and so you're one of the last remaining Jedi or so you think is it Order 66 like a GU leg or something. Nice. Yeah order 66 was like a bad guy said hey Execute Order 66 and all of these army men are all these Troopers clone troopers. Has ended up killing all the Jedi, you know, so like unexpectedly like a betrayal. That's basically Order 66.	0.0
Okay. Well, I killed like hundreds of Clone Troopers so far.	1.0
So he'll everyone else died like a little genocide you got going on there. Yeah. Yeah.	1.0
Well Clone Trooper is are very this pork Hood Troopers are very self-deprecating with her humor. Yeah, are they like that in the movies and stuff, too?	0.0
Or what? Well, it's like the movies are super just like Blue Collar guys. Yeah, they are. That's why I like in some ways like the Jedi are kind of fucked up for killing these guys, you know, these guys are just going to work. They're just doing their shit, you know, yeah, you know, they okay. What's the big deal? They're trying to put order in government and Jedi are these radical fanatic religious zealots trying to take over the world using saying things like what stands in the way becomes the way, you know, using philosophy. Yeah. It's almost like you could take the Yoda thing.	1.0
Thing. Oh speaking of Yoda. I saw a baby Yoda in the Mandalorian.	1.0
Yeah, very cute. Yeah, such a cute. I know it's like the best part of the whole show. That's another. Oh my God, I forgot we watch the Mandalorian to dude.	1.0
Yeah, I did it. Oh, that's a spoiler. That's okay, dude. I forgot.	1.0
Yeah, that's why I it's fine. Well, you're wrong. I mean you're kind of wrong about that.	1.0
Anyway, it's a yodel. It was there like a girl Yoda. I saw this on some.	1.0
Yeah, it's stupid We Don't Belong talking about yodel. It's not a spoiler.	0.0
Okay, it's not as though I don't know. We don't know what the gender is.	1.0
Okay, so it's not a tailor specialty mean. It's like a weird and two different species. Okay. What do you think of the manual? Okay. So this is an interesting take because launders has no experience with Star Wars and some would even say he's like dumb as hell just get me. And me and intellectual know that it's true. I'm super into Star Wars. I'm very curious about your take for someone who doesn't who's not like a complete nerd.	1.0
I watched that when I watch that first episode. I didn't like it at all. Really. Yeah. I like them. I like to second episode. I may be getting used to stuff there are some stuff so I actually kind of had a question. So this happens in a lot of movies not just Star Wars but where if they put on like big bulky suits The shirt and they they have objects like they're handing coins across the counter that are like larger than normal. They don't look like they have the correct weight. Like I know they might be on another planet may be different gravity. But do you know what I'm talking about? Like when he's climbing on the giant tractor and they're throwing shit at him the Wookiees are ya they and it doesn't feel like they're those blocks and stuff are the right weight. So feels like looks not Dido cheap corny. I don't know how to put it put it but doesn't look realistic.	0.0
You're great. Keep it together. This is the stupidest shit I've ever heard. That's that's where you're drawing the boundaries of the about the fact that their hurtling through space and freezing apartment of might be different maybe SP gravity's like 400, but then it seems like the gravity for other occasions like when he's running does it look like it looks like it's the same gravity as Earth. Okay. So let me let me address this from not a physics. We're not going to talk about Gravity of planets like that has some factor into it. Like it's like different different races to so like there's there's like so you're talking about the main character the Mandalorian the guy on his armor. So like 'hey, so the lure is that he mandalorians never take off their armor basically like so he's used to that so he's probably like pretty strong, you know,	1.0
and so no not as he looks fine is he's fine. It was like the objects that he was interact or other seeing where it's the objects that other people are interacting with or that were like being used on him and stuff is so like Jawas.	1.0
Oh you're saying the jaw was not the Wookiees.	1.0
They said something about like look, he's right language or something. Do they speak the same language? No. No, not at all. That's okay Jawan. He's a little racist.	0.0
No, I don't know what they should meet. They just speak something else. I'm not sure what it's called.	0.0
When he's is probably not he said something about their language. He's like you don't speak good job.	0.0
Yeah, you don't speak ja you don't speak good Jawa Jawan. He's no I they do. I guess that's fair. I mean, it's just supposed to be a little silly. You know, it's supposed to look corny in certain scenes, but the vibe of it is so damn it, but the aesthetic of the the show is so like it's way darker than I thought it would be you know for like a she's there's no Star Wars.	0.0
Terms of mood I'm not trying to be an asshole so know you're getting genuine. All right, like Society lie so that I feels like the at some point it felt like you're watching like the first first episodes like nice and slow in your they kind of there's not a lot of talking which is I appreciate they do a lot of kind of establishing shots and they really let you kind of try to understand the Mandalorian without showing to just over facing on the personality front and just like shoving it down your throat, which I think was also Next vacuum Patients Out of the viewers, but then at the same time there was like so many kind of like corny Parts where it felt like you're kind of you're constantly flipping in and out of the moment of it being very serious to being light-hearted and I genuinely could not tell if it was like a show for people who are young or show for people who are older.	0.0
That's totally that's that's a good I think that's fair because I felt the same thing like there are certain things that stuck out to me, especially in the first episode like remember that blue guy. Why none of that blue guy in the first episode he was so out of place in my eyes. Like he he totally like totally didn't fit the show because like the Mandalorian at it's very core. It seems to me like it's like a space Western, you know, and it's like everyone's grittier and it is cheesy in some parts like the I have spoken guy, but it's still totally relevant. But the blue guy to me in the first episode stuck out like a sore thumb like he he broke the tone for me. That's when I was like, oh this might Bad show so I share the sentiment but I think okay overarching lie like the show is darker grittier, but it still has that like that Star Wars cheese in it though. It's like the character like the hard thing is now to make the Mandalorian an empathetic character because he's not taking off his helmet. I think that's going to be really interesting.	1.0
I thought it was he's never going to take it off. I'm not sure if he doesn't they don't take off their armor.	0.0
Yeah. It's like their religion.	1.0
Yeah. So yeah, he's like guns or religion to me. And he's like all these specific things that he couldn't do. Yeah. Yeah. Also, I wasn't sure how cool he was. I felt like they're trying to do like kind of like a drive Vibe Ryan Gosling for Drive type 5, which I liked but then that's the vibe that if anything goes wrong, he's definitely capable of fixing it, even though he gets really fucked up. Yeah, but I right he's been he's been like Daddy by a couple of characters who are either smarter than him or whatever. Hmm. So but I guess you know, I got to have like that humanizing element as you watch him kind of learned sure.	1.0
Super bot in man. I think the director Jon Favreau who's just incredible. He's so talented. It's he done. He did Chef remember having seen that some a lot of shit man. He's really really talented and then Dave filoni he did. He basically did all the cartoons for Star Wars which was really dope. And so it's like edit strikes that Vibe too. So I'm super excited. Let's keep watching it. There's only eight episodes 30 40 minutes. It's I think it's super worth it and Disney plus Rock so I'm a big hill.	1.0
I'm shocked at how many people got Disney plus. How is Disney owns a wig another guy color coming full circle on the subscription thing and then people are going to start picking like what subscriptions they were going to stop for the fact that like another one was better or that was one other one had enough no now it does knees at but Disney owns everything Man Marvel.	0.0
They own like Pixar. They own National Geographic.	1.0
That's A cool but like ones that's why would you pay for National Geographic? It's a weird thing to pay for. I feel like I guess I don't know my dad would stand around and watch National Geographic on TV all day or whatever but like and like once I everyone seen every fucking Pixar movie and then you're going to watch the new one theater is and then like well, maybe that's you I think people have kids and stuff to you know, I think most people you have Disney plus.	1.0
Oh, yeah, I guess that's true. I don't know why I'm sticking up for the parents. We have kids longer. Okay shit. I just leaked my kid. No stay over there.	1.0
I need on get away.	1.0
Daddy's doing his work. No.	0.0
No, I mean I like so there's some good Disney shit out there man, like even for adult Marvel movies are trash and then you get so you do get and like a Disney movies like you've seen them already so I don't really So for a subscription service little weird to me, but unless they have countering the sorry guys original shows.	0.0
Yeah, they will like the Mandalorian but what about Netflix? Fuck Netflix? What's on Netflix? That's good.	1.0
I don't know is that just has like it's like a nice blanket for all the older shows. Like I re-watched.	0.0
The office on the office is leaving Netflix now to now they're going to do the product like everything that's good is leaving Netflix.	0.0
Okay there take they left.	1.0
Yeah, they're going to edit. I just like don't think of it any good show on Netflix now.	1.0
So like if you can you want like a general blanket just like service even if you have Amazon Prime, which if you guys have Amazon Prime do not feel like you think that means It's like a horrible watch you can watch like Amazon video for free. Yeah, it has a lot of shit to and then you're going to get Disney plus 2. Yeah, I don't know how else you have anything else.	1.0
I think it's the bubble launders. I found it.	1.0
I have HBO besides didn't HBO's one thing I would get some a fucking HBO slut. I love H. AI love each leg Yeah, so I would do that because that's like they have so many shows that are there. Is that are all good.	1.0
Yeah, and they have a small.	1.0
All quantity, but they have like such good quality is my thing to go watch stuff that I've said I've seen but just like covers like a big, you know vast array of things.	1.0
Yeah. That's fair. I don't know. You know what long as I think I found the bubble.	1.0
Okay. I think we're in a constantly found the bubble.	1.0
I think we're in a Content bubble. Because content bubble. Yeah, because people's Leisure Time Has stayed the same if not minimize. Like if not over time has become less and less like people's time to watch entertainment. But the more content that's being produced there less time like people like me have to consume it. So then we have to make choices like there's some good content that I won't watch. So at some point with all these Services coming in we're going to lose like the ability to even in participate or watch like great great shows so that much that's money lost. You know. Yeah that's sort of a and I choose and now for some reason I choose to consume less like easily accessible content over excellent content, you know, like instead of watching like Better Call Saul I'm going to instead opt for like a twitch stream because it's so accessible.	1.0
Whoa, I don't I don't though. I wouldn't really like I watch you have introduced Game of Thrones. Homie, you have to allocate time though. I like I like I watched shows on the plane. Like I told you don't watch them at home. Yeah, I'll watch some on the plane. So I'll do all of the show watching. So then yeah because if I wasn't if I didn't have that part where I could just say, like I'll have like a tattle I can say I'll have like 20 hours a month on a plane. So there I can just put all my show time. They're not waste any of my other time. So that but if I didn't do that then yeah, I probably wouldn't watch a lot of shows.	0.0
Yeah. See you. I mean you did a roundabout lay we went to loop the loop to get to go back here.	1.0
And that's why I locating time has been a yeah. It's just gets more and more challenging. That's true. That's what I think.	1.0
That's it's crazy that twitch streams can compete with that stuff. I wouldn't think that you know that people opt to watch lower effort.	0.0
What is this thing about liveness that you just can't look away. It's crazy.	0.0
There's this really good book out there called present shocked by Douglas book.	1.0
On how to become a better streamer what my God, I'm not hard.	0.0
There's a there's this book and it's basically like he talks about the value of live like of like sub like, it's not just live it's live and you are part of the content as a viewer. I think that's something really unique that only exist but we had on screen.	1.0
That's what you're saying.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, but I'm saying like that's that's a few and look at TV Dude TV. Is also like all these Netflix deals that are all these twitch deals that you can stream certain shows on Amazon. That's like the next level because people want to be the content, you know, and I think just viewing the content isn't enough for our brains now just passively watching something you everyone wants to participate in it and Twitches like gaming is the ultimate medium. That's right because it's like a sub entertainment now, you know, it's like weird. It's like you it's chat is responsible for Providing a good stream in some ways. You know, it's like hey, it's a very strange phenomenon was he just did he talk about Twitch in that book or know? So I mean he taught he basically it's a really good book. I suggest everyone reads it but he basically talked about the emergence of like modern entertainment and the sense of like The Simpsons being the one to break the ground basically completely breaking the fourth wall inviting people to participate almost in the sense of like like this is ironic. I'm going to make fun of things in a very ironic way and You know it as an advice like as someone who's smart and pays attention like you can participate in that because only you understand this for reference. And then in the same same stance like Twitches in the live entertainment is the same way like you can under you are able to watch this at this present moment and can participate in it. So he's saying that basically his product prediction is that people will get more and more involved in the content that they consume until it becomes extremely homogeneous, you know. Yeah, it like breaks down the relationship of An audience number until everyone is up on the podium together. You know.	1.0
Whoa, that's why reality TV works. So well write exactly because it's like you're selling you're selling and active participation on things that people are questioning people like they want to just they want to sit there and fucking starfish and just watch it and just like consumed while they're really bored. I do they some is lots of passive participants in streams to write a cherry majority of viewers aren't talking and chatted and anystream.	1.0
Oh absolutely, but chat is still participating like like like forsen is chat. I'll give you an example forces chats amazing because because you know, they are they are so part of the stream like imagine watching for some without chat, you know, like it's like totally missing part of the experience even if it's so boring, but right I mean what am I right? It would be boring. I mean, I'd like to say it would be boring.	1.0
But okay better example because force is actually a pretty funny but like yeah period you would never even think he would have a lot of viewers. Right way, you would think that but he's not meanwhile, he's got 20,000 audience crazy spam in the the craziest shit.	1.0
It's amazing. But even then even in those encrypt periods chat. I'm not participating but chat representing my view, you know, like there's almost like this we're owner Ali connected and saying the same thing and it's like that's why I love like the streamer and shat relationship. I think it's so unique and funny because it's like we're all supposed to pretend like we have equal. We're on equal footing even though we're all watching One Loser on camera, you know, like it's funny like it should be a there should be some sort of relationship and the best dreamers that I see like xqc and everyone know how to use chat in that way.	1.0
Oh my God, they're so funny.	1.0
Excuse me is this is such a good streamer. He's so good but he uses chat like chats a tool for him. It's not a side thing. It's like this chat. He plays with chat strings like Clint Stevens. Other one, he knows what to say to get the reaction like that's like barely puts in any energy and he just is so relaxed and it's so fun to watch.	1.0
Yeah. Well Clint dude. Yeah me too.	1.0
Fuk sick console six.	0.0
Danzo's the timing on that. The delivery was just purchase pristine. It was me.	1.0
It's so good and he's like, he always streaming. It's just wild to me that he's not just insanely exhausted like	1.0
all the tire right? He's got it. He's kind of got everything figured out to the point that he's not even too far off of himself. He just having a little fun, you know probably isn't trying that hard. He just kind of has everybody invested in his product as opposed to trying to figure out what everyone wants to see exactly but I have a feeling launders at all.	1.0
These really good streamers. They're super introspective. Like they probably are crazy. I don't want to say insecure in a bad way but introspective maybe they're probably insanely introspective on what works and what doesn't	1.0
You know and I'm sure over the years could it be an accident right unless you were a meme and then you would and that way everyone would know you were an idiot sure be different.	0.0
No, and I know there's obviously like luck involved.	0.0
But I think these a lot of these dreamers are just like very talented and they can't Point their finger on what that Talent is, but they have it, you know, they have whatever it could but I mean if they did it themselves, like what if you were their friend you might know more about them than the viewers do sure is like a might just kind of just like you want to pull the Veil Down if you were that streamer. It weird when you even have that conversation with people in the middle of your highly entertaining stream. It doesn't make sense. Hey, this is why we love having that conversation.	1.0
You know sure yeah, it's like it's like kayfabe in wrestling but it's like everyone knows it's fake but we choose to think it's real because it's more entertaining that's like exactly what streaming is like, right? Yeah. It's true. You know, it's like it's a show it's like you're putting on a performance as chat and the streamers putting on a performance, you know, knowing that nothing really matters and this, you know, That's true. That's so sick. It's really cool. That's why I like about twitch.	1.0
You know, it's just nice. That's like a really kind of like that's like a kind of very cordial handshake right where it is. Yeah. Everyone was just trying to have fun. That's what that is the point of the game, you know, when people I do like when people are like they know sometimes it goes too far with like I ice beside ins streams and stuff like that, but when people are like, oh it's content its content like everybody is so aware. Yeah what that is almost sickening but like at least it's better than people not being aware and buying into Something that they don't understand it's kind of cool that if you'd like people are I remember like when he's first started it like watching YouTube your favorite YouTubers couldn't have a fucking sponsor without everyone calling them fucking sellouts or Yeah by trying to dissuade them. Tell them they're unsubscribe and shit like that. And now people understand the plights of the guys were probably make it like millions of dollars more than like their parents do they'll be like no he's just got to do this right? He's just this is important. How is he going to make a living if he doesn't take on a Sir, we have to be supportive like all that stuff. That's the kind of rhetoric. You didn't hear from the average fan or viewer for like 10 or 15 years ago.	1.0
I agree and I think that comes with positives and negatives but I think the positives outweigh the negatives where it's like fuck you and also fuck you too, but it's kind of funny, you know like that, you know, because that's a thing. I feel like this is gonna sound like very Boomer talk, but I feel like the actual Baby Boomers don't understand that about the internet, you know, like the actual baby boomers are like, oh my God. Russia and oh my God, like these huge issues on the internet but like YouTube is consuming my kids days and nights, you know, but the kids know it's like a big meme, you know, and nothing is really serious and it's like an inside joke with the kids who know something that the adults don't don't you explain it to them.	1.0
They're going to just think that you're really stupid exactly.	0.0
So I love that about like twitch and YouTube. It's like everyone who knows knows and if you don't you're just a boomer like an actual Boomer like not even the meme. You know, yeah, that's it. So safe.	1.0
I think it's great to have the word because it does it does it does explain people a lot better than many other words. So I think I'm happy for the word Boomer.	1.0
I love that. It's like you've come to that conclusion, even though you're been so sensitive about being called a boomer in the last episode. It's been a month. He literally quit the podcast.	1.0
This is not because I wanted this to be stopped being called a boomer. That's not why I quit the podcast. Oh, yes.	0.0
You are. God cast stopped. Yeah, go ahead launders.	1.0
I think it's is just it just just coincidence.	1.0
It's just a boomer coincidence. No such thing man. You got to put the pedal to the metal. All right, if you don't work, you don't get paid.	0.0
Stop talking to me. Like you're not 50% of the fucking show.	0.0
I'm 50% There we go. Sorry where you got it, baby. We got it. I'm running the show long as you know, we have a new	0.0
Podcast review speaking of oh, do you want to read it or me? I'll read it.	1.0
Okay, go ahead and I have it up right now. And so here it is new podcast review by five stars, but five star review by evilly kneel friend of the podcast white climb Lacroix are delicious. Hey guys, really love the podcast a ton. The only thing that would make me love it more is if I could listen to it while wearing boxers slides really enjoy both of your guys content and personalities and the podcast is always really funny. The only thing that could be improved upon. Oh is if launders would finally give white cloth a chance and stop with his blind hatred of such a delicious drink Lacroix is also good, especially the tall Earth in cans with the to flavor. Did you just write the second would be angrier about his opinions? If you didn't have such a great bull cut all of you including Nathan because he needs more love. Keep up the great work on the podcast and squeaks. Keep up the great work with the beard. God bless this man. God bless this man. What a heroic. What a hero man.	1.0
If that was a good review dude.	1.0
That was a good review. And it was awesome. Here's I'll post a link in chat for how to leave a review as well.	1.0
Everyone has opinions and I'm just like to take a second to appreciate that and just say I encourage people to have opinions.	1.0
That's all. Wow. You're so Reverend man. That's really smart. Thank you so much. Yeah, thank you so much for the for the review. You will kneel I appreciate it a ton. And yeah, I think launders has to be more open-minded for someone who dies is rare willy-nilly who makes this happen.	1.0
You think close-minded people do this?	0.0
No, I think you have you know, what you're like a Milano, you know, you have this you have this exterior that that seems wild and and fun, but then you don't try new things. You know God is the same old chocolate.	0.0
Because you were horizontal stripes her one day. It's changed my vibe dude, as soon as the camera goes off like squeak puts on a tie just so you can fall asleep peacefully.	1.0
It's okay good I can I say something. It really is sad to come home from the Working Day and remove my suit to put on something that looks like I've been lounging around.	1.0

So right this moment if you have a track that you haven't finished for a while, but you don't know how to finish or you just can't finish it. Ask yourself a question. Why do I want to finish this track? Because maybe you don't. And that will be a great knowledge because you can actually move on and finish something that you truly want to finish.	1.0

it turns out that the 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear tests actually work tests. They were trying to kill something and you ever heard of a ship called the USS Lawton that was there during that time. Well, neither did I and out of 1,000 young men on that ship one man. William Randall was the only Survivor they told his family. She was sunk in a battle. But Randall says he knows what he saw and in his words. It had no conscience. No reasoning just destroy and he spent the last 30 years trying to prove the truth of what he learned. Day and what he learned is what you guys are about to learn Guyz this planet doesn't belong to us ancient species only this Earth long before Mankind and if we keep our heads buried in the sand any longer, they will take it back. There's this agency which goes by the name of Monarch in a specializes in the hunt for massive unidentified terrestrial organisms. And today it is a today's episode is on just one of them the skull crawler. The information I got is from the King Kong Wiki and from the Monarch files. Here we go. Little is known about the origins of this voracious Predator. Although its evolutionary purpose is it is abundantly clear the skull crawler exists to devour destroy and dominate Subterranean a nature and burrowing up through through the geologically unstable. Steve leant across Skull Island. It is as though the skull crawler climbed up out of hell itself, and this terrifying Serpentine animal is a hyper for a creature with such a hyper a generalized metabolism that it exists in And of course instead of starvation and just as a shark must keep swimming to survive the the skull crawler must keep feeding dislocate dislocating its own jawbone's so to maximize its ability to swallow anything that crosses its path and within that gaping cavernous small exists along Whiplash tongue in which the creature uses to ensnare and constrict its prey.	1.0

And once it has picked up your scent the blood in your veins.	1.0

Perhaps most striking is it is to be fearful vistage a chilling lidless skull face peers out through translucent flesh. And as too dark and lifeless eye sockets regard their prey with cold unflinching malice and the powdered of its facial features, maybe maybe maybe indicative or indicate of of bluffing Behavior. It designed to threaten and terrify its prey and Monarch has observed different skull crawlers in a variety of Different sizes and he give it the unreachable depths of their Subterranean. Nesting grounds scientists have no way of knowing how big these things really get or the pecking order that governs their trouble feeding patterns the more they learn about the cultural history of Skull Island from the agenda from the indigenous petroglyphs. They have discovered the clearer it becomes that the evolution of the skull collars has long been into woven with Cog and his Fallen ancestors if Kong is a god of sky island then Here Comes The Devil	1.0
Evil skull crawlers are large reptilian creatures with only two long forelimbs and no hind limbs as well as long prehensile Serpentine snake-like Tails. They have long and slender. He had muscular sturdy bodies and several aspects of their appearances are noticeably skeletal particularly with their torsos in their heads and what and what appeared to be the eye sockets of the skull like heads are actually merely empty fenestrae presumably that it evolved that way in order to	1.0
Protect its eyes from the other bees because it's realize are actually set much farther back and and the colors of other scales range from dark brown to dark green to dark green to a bold white color. There has closely resembles those of mosasaurs such as Tylosaurus and their jaws and the Jaws possesses two rows of serrated razor-sharp teeth and the skull colors have four digits and total of each of each hand with the thumb being the smallest digit and the rest of the dudes being larger. and of the same size and the adults have a prominent bony Spike have a prominent bony Spike that protrudes out of each of their elbows and the thorny tooth like structures other inner mouth somewhat resembled that of those of a leatherback turtle and additionally they they have long triple forked tongues that they could use to grab their prey with smaller skull crawlers are easily are easily distinguishable for the larger ones because their heads are smaller and more sloped and they also possess a more probability brown skin tone larger skull crawlers are almost as big as Kong and their heads are more defined and somewhat angled and their tails are also armed by some form of club that could be used as a weapon and also have boats bikes protruding from their elbows like I said before, The skull crawlers were designed to act as the Fallen Angels of cogs Kagan and represent the darker Bleaker aspects of Skull Island. The voice of the skull crawler is very high in tone. It's possessing a raspy quality of the hiss and growl mixed in between according to supervisor sound a sound designer and editor Al Nelson. The skull crawlers voice was inspired by the painful bye-bye the painful squeal of a Dying rabbit. And also the and sounds of sea lions and squirrels are mixed together. And this is what is the sound that they commonly make? And one of its vocalizations work we cycled from the indominus Rex from Jurassic World. And unless it's called crawlers appear to be naturally Fearless as two of them teamed up to attack Kong despite being smaller and outmuscled. The largest of the skull crawlers which by some has been given the nickname scold devil appear to be more intelligent than the rest of his kind and this was seen it when he appeared only ones called was subdued by Preston Packard and we'll what it felt like and what it felt like Earl Cole was tricking it. It also has to has to also seems to have a hint of sad ISM or sadism as as it licked columns face maliciously after he'd been Tangled Up and of shipwrecks Rudder chain, this large skull crawler was also shown to have deep desire. Killing and eating humans and that was shown several times when he diverted his attention from Kong to Jan's comrade at Mason Weaver implying that he opted that that he acts not only from Primal Instinct, but from over some degree of malice and cruelty.	1.0
This could also hit that the skull crawlers are are unbelievably malevolent as take Marlo calls some nasty and mean as hell as the apex predators of Skull Island Skull crawlers are fearsome and deadly in battle. Usually their Jaws full of razor sharp. Teeth is the primary weapons and they hold their own against opponents such as Kong as they're able to withstand the blows and public of the ape and then the serpent like tails are used for swatting or for wrapping around an opponent during combat.	1.0
And the tail is heavily muscled and extremely powerful and that's shown with the office the the alpha skulk are lifted and flung Kong like a football across the lake with his tail and as stated before that the tail is also for wrapping around large prey possibly to latch onto them for balance or to constrict them. And it's called crawlers are Subterranean Predators with insatiable appetites that are that are the result of their height and metabolisms. They are both solitary and pack Hunters one can kill a big buffalo on its own and they can cooperate to take down more powerful creatures such as calm and being some training and nature skull crawlers are capable of using their limbs to burrow deep into the Earth and they seem to have mostly mostly a primal mindset and they are highly aggressive so practically hostile As well as incredibly persistent in pursuing their prey. They do have however show some degree of intelligence shown when the skull devil the largest of the skull crawlers with refuses to devour somebody armed With Grenades and simply swats a person away school colors are very are very durable as they can withstand bullets from rifles and even the Searing heat from a flamethrower and the alpha skull crawler was only dazed when calling slammed his head with a boulder or smashed his face with a tree branch and they have incredible. More stamina because they're able to stay in a full-fledged fight for several minutes. Even while being incredibly injured and the skull crawler appear to be actually more intelligent than the others and this was seen and this received because he appeared only ones calling was subdued and it all and and its colors possess possess accelerated metabolism, which causes them to live in constant constant starvation, and this is shown when the skull devil ravenously tried to eat neither and refuse to let go of Congress arm and calm down turned his appetite. Against it did tearing out its tongue and other internal organs and had it often and had it let go it would have in fact survive as Congress holding Weaver and adults colors tongue. Now, I'm going to say to say what their role was in the film. It's called crawler was stirred. It was first seen feasting on on a dead squirrel Buffalo by Kong and called was about to confront the creature when he was ambushed by a second skull crawler after a lengthy battle called it Kong ends up subduing and killing both skull crawlers by Smashing one skull with a devastating Stomp and the other by stuffing its head into the ground breaking its neck. And another skull crawler ambushed Jack Chapman and a Spore mantis, but I went for Chapman and ate him alive while the sport management mantis managed to escape and that same and that very same skull crawler. Then showed up in the Boneyard and regurgitated Chapman's remains and this was actually normal behavior because the because the skull crawler wasn't being sick. It was just getting rid of the indigestible stuff and when William Randa attempted to make his camera work, he was devoured by it and he then it and then tried to attack the	0.0
and red is camera started flashing inside the Predator which started to aggravate it and the skull color then started chasing Mason Weaver, but the group retaliated against it using flamethrowers and the creature batted a crew member with its tail onto one of the Congress calls causing his backpack to death to detonate several cancers of toxic gas and then the skull crawler started to grow Relentless and Disturbed a flock of resting Leaf Wings, which then turned their attention to attack at the group and James Conrad managed to	0.0
To kill some of the flying creatures using Hank Marlo's Katana a in case you know what that is a gitanos a sword. And the skull crawler then set its eyes on Conrad and and reg slivko, but we were rescued them by tossing a lighter. I one of the Subterranean events creating an explosion that killed the skull color immediately. Then then the giant skull crawler which given the nickname scold devil was waked due to seismic explosive dropped on the Skull Island along with the rest of his kind after calling was incapacitated by Packard. It's called out the skull devil left. His presence be known by emerging. From the bed to the water thus and that began a three part about it what's called? I will have the upper hand on confidentially. And as he changed and as he chased James Conrad and the other survivors of the research that I've mentioned said to Skull Island Earl Cole tried to sacrifice himself by arming several grenades before having the massive creature tried to eat him to both creature up. However, it's called Apple didn't fall for this and he batted up against the cliff as a grenade went off killing him as the skull devil. Finally reached the rest of the crew calling appear to just in time to start with a large Boulder as the crew ran to safety and then the and then thus called overturns. Devil turned his focused to Kong counting on him and gripping his throat with his Jaws called in the skull devil could take them to brutally wrestle puddle and bite each other until the skull down Force Conga to a shipwreck with a blow from his tail where what he had came became entangled to the chains. I think that's a reference to the to of on King Kong film. And with conch subdued in the wreck, the massive skull down will return his Focus to the humans. And as he approached the crew once more the skull Devil's right.	0.0
I was was destroyed by a flare that we were fired at this allowed Cog to use and swing the propeller of a wrecked ship at his adversary similar to a medieval flail.	0.0
And in that called the beasts of the shoulder and a lot of called to resume the fight with him. During the battle. He was also fired upon By Conrad and his companions and that allowed called to gain an advantage and that allowed Kong to get an advantage of the fight before finally upper Cunningham was the ship's propeller slicing his throat open and seemingly killing him and and and as we ever will and after Weaver was knocked into the water earlier in the fight combat is to save her from drowning, but unfortunately, the giant skull called was still alive and he pounced Called once more after quality his tail around Prague. He wrapped his tongue around the HR and pulling it down his gullet and an attempt to devour Weaver, but after a brief struggle called tour the creatures tongue where which is connected to its internal organs out of his mouth killing him instantly avenging the deaths of his parents and that stated I personally imagine calling saying this like a she's ripping it out.

Goodbye, the native so much and their food by the natives to the point where they don't wear their won't mention their true name. And and this makes the name skull crawler a nickname as Marlo as I take Marlo admitted. He just made up a name to make them sound scarier. But the true name is Cranium rep tent and the the skull crawlers are similar in appearance to the mud demons from the third Chronicles of Riddick movie and they are known to be responsible for killing Kong's parents and wiping out a species leaving.	0.0
to be the last of his kind and this is seen and in the comic book known as Skull Island berth of column and mentioned by Hank Marlowe and remains of advantage of the deceased parents are called receipt of the skull crawlers territory of the movie and given that there are no dinosaurs in the movie and that the remains are President Scholars territory is possible that dinosaurs Old Scotland if they were once present there may have been wiped out by the skull crawlers or or something else that some unknown event prior to the film and During the production of the film The reason why there were no dinosaurs in the movie besides Triceratops skull was because it was because Jordan Valle de vocht Roberts thought that Jurassic world was still fresh in everyone's mind and praises and Praises Peter Jackson for for doing a decent job for making King Kong fight of earwax and in 2005 version, so he did it. So he tried to make up completely such make them look completely made-up creatures in the film, but the but the but the skull cause I got a pretty good crawling Bo It's like they reach their it's like they reach their arms around and they step they can also fall over pretty easily.

Welcome to the construction Brothers podcast. I'm your host Tyler Campbell and with me like he is every week giving me a smirk my brother Eddie Campbell. That was just a smile. That was a smirk its mark means I'm up to something. Well, we got an awesome show for you. Today. We're going to be talking to mr. Tyler / a of f of my Consultants about Mega projects. We were really excited to get to that here. In a moment, but first things first, I'm like to bring something to your attention. No, no, no don't don't don't so it's been cold here in Middle, Georgia. Eddie of you. Have you noticed that it's been a little bit cold? Yeah, give the fact it was like 80 directly before the 29. Yeah. Yeah, I noticed Yeah, so in case you guys don't know we live in Middle, Georgia Middle, Georgia can't make up its mind on whether so we'll go from 80 degrees one day and 30 the next it will just drop overnight. It's absolutely insane. Yeah, actually did that last week it literally did so but here's the thing Florida also got smacked with this little cold front to and there was a little news article that HuffPost put up that I was Giggling at earlier. So some things are falling out of trees and they're not the Coconuts. Are they snakes? They're not snakes. I was hoping there was no not snakes. Again. We passed on that no coconuts and no snakes. They're not monkeys. What are they? So the National Weather Service Office in Miami tweeted don't be surprised. If you see iguanas falling from the trees tonight as lows drop. Up into the 30s and 40s, brr. Yeah, especially if you're an iguana, so it's something that they don't usually talk about and I've heard of this before whenever it gets really cold down in Florida iguanas start falling from the trees because they just they can't handle it. They're not dead. They're just Frozen. Well, they're cold-blooded. Yeah. Yeah, so cold weather is kind of tough on something like that counting that subsists because of the Sun and its heat when that goes away has a hard time. It's true. It's true, especially when in trees I'm going to read on a little bit so iguanas aren't dangerous or aggressive to humans, but the damage seawalls sidewalks and Landscape foliage and can dig lengthy tunnels. Actually. I didn't know that did you know that a Guam has dug tunnels? No. That's kind of terrifying that's news to me. It's like a dinosaur digging a tunnel a mini dinosaurs a micro dinosaur building a tunnel it is I wonder if elon's going to like get 200,000 iguanas and like try to get them to dig tunnels under Ela or so. That's how he's gonna get us how he's gonna do it. He's not actually going to use a machine. He's just going to get all of the iguana's he's got a tiny Army of iguanas. To dig his tunnel under Los Angeles. I mean the man's genius secret. That's the secret. What you do is you have to harness them together. So you get to Belt any straps groups of ten together and then he makes this massive circle of iguanas that he just sets underground and they start chopping away does the circle spin I think so like a carousel. Yeah. It's like a vertical Carousel with iguanas. Yeah. He leads them. Buying by using electric heaters. So he basically entices them with a heat source. And so they move towards the heat source. It's science everybody history. It's mr. Tyler Perez going to be proud of this intro I can hear now. Hey, man, you should have done your research before getting interviewed by us. You didn't know you didn't know. I don't know nothing about nothing. But that intro man. We are smart around here at school this week. I would like to introduce a new segment and we're going to call that segment. Shower thoughts buckle up. For those of you that don't know there is a subreddit called our shower thoughts on it. You can scroll through and a lot of people just post their post their shower thoughts on there. And a lot of these are are quite interesting. So I kind of wanted to take some time today and read them to you and I figured we'd all have a nice little chuckle about this and or Break our brains a little bit just because of how awesome these are they deep. Some of them is this like deep thoughts. Let me give you the let me give you the first one on my list. Okay, if your thumb is chopped off you lose your middle finger. Yeah. Okay, I can see how this would be a mind-blowing thing. More people have stood on the moon then on your desk. That's not true. Is it not know how is it not true because more people have stood on my desk. No, it's not. How do you know who stood on your desk? Why are you standing on your desk for what have you stood on your desk? I've never stood on my desk. So how can you make this argument? Because somebody else has who small people though? We're not going there. Why can't I talk about my kids on the show man? I'm gonna he's not. Oh my gosh. Okay. Well, I thought you were going another way with that. But yeah, okay fine. No Tyler. I was not and I would like you to go read the employment posters now because spiders mold every time you think you see a dead spider you might be looking at the skin of a live spider that is now larger than it was before. I did not need to hear that today. No, I know you love spiders. Yeah - there are gallons of saliva traveling through the postal system at any given moment. I have a question. What do you like licking stamps and envelopes? Sometimes they had I don't know how you feel man, really mixed emotions. Yeah, really mixed emotions. Some of them actually taste. Okay, if you think about it, it's kind of got a muted taste. It's not anything earth-shattering. It's not like Gordon Ramsay himself cooked something and slathered like some broth on the outside of the envelope for you to lick. Okay, let me bring this full circle. Okay. Is there a market for envelopes that taste good? I think there is actually there are envelopes out there that tastes good are there. Yeah, I think there's there's why with me yeah, this is too obvious. Yeah. Like popcorn slathered in butter. That's terrible. Here's one for you. All numbers are closer to 0 than they are to Infinity. I just watch Teddy's head explode. Okay. All right here. Oh, okay. Now here's one dentist study the dangers of plaque in order to receive a plaque that says they can remove your plaque. That's a lot of levels of plaque it is it's like plaque exception. How do you feel about flying? I think that it's a good idea. And most of the time I leave it at that I always bleed every time I floss then the lady over at the dentist's office is always like this because you don't floss and I'm like, but I bleed when I flies I'm like so you're telling me that I would build calluses between my teeth and my teeth holes that would it would prevent the bleeding. And your and your teeth Caverns dude. I I I call Shenanigans. I think big floss is out to get us probably is yeah. Yeah. No, this is all just a racket and all the Mr. In it. They're out there trying to sell their Wares trying to sell us string string with mint flavoring on it in some cases. You know what all this time. They could be tied in with the envelopes to the the people that make the tasty envelopes. Because you think about it. It's the same technology. You're applying Taste of paper, you know, like or like string or like textiles you haven't lived though until you got that piece of popcorn stuck in your teeth in the floss comes in for the rescue and saves the day I got used to do that. No, that's your penalty for eating popcorn. I refuse to use no, I will not use floss to dislodge a popcorn brightest popcorn have to have any kind of punitive value attached to it because Because when it comes out you can eat. So you're saving it for later? Yeah gives you it gives you something to do. What do you think of beards for? Well, why do you think I have a beard to save it for later? Obviously. It's crumb catcher. That's what it is. It's your peanut butter and jelly for lunch. By the way, I didn't have peanut butter and jelly belly. Well that's even scarier than what's in my beard. All right. Well, let's let's move this thing along. Let's talk about Tyler / a so he came in and he wanted to discuss mega-projects FMI is really huge in finding reports and collecting information and spreading that out to people Eddie. I feel like this was more Show then mine listening back to it because you had you just nerded out on a lot of these factoids. This is just right in your veins. So I think I think we should just call this one the Eddie show. Haha. Yeah now I still construction Brothers man. No, no, it's the Eddie show. Okay. Yeah, but I think I said like two words and you hear a chuckle from me. All right, that's it. Everybody comment if you like that format and everybody comment if you miss me. Mom that's that's shit. I'm looking at you that's dangerous man. He had me nerding out because I'm I'm curious about what's going on in construction. Mmm, and he's got he's got research to back up the things that he's saying. Yeah, and so when he's coming at us talking about mega-projects talking about market trends talking about what's going on with Our labor shortages, he has resources and knowledge to back that up. And I think that there is going to be a lot of value to this show. Mmm. Maybe not just may not be for absolutely everyone. I think it's going to be intriguing for most. Yeah, and there's a lot of content here that I feel like just great content, but I do see people that are on the front end of construction trying to decide what they're doing. With projects and how they're how they're going about business right here in a lot of value here. One of the things that really stuck out to me back to the labor shortage. He was saying that we lost a lot of that labor back in O8 during the crash. Yeah, they left and they just never came together came back. And so that is something that we're facing now and something that gets a code often is we need labor. I don't know how many times I've read articles in the recent past that say, I mean, Can too are you a human being do you have a pulse? And those are your requirements? Do you know how to get out of bed? Like we're that starved for Laborers. I'm only being a little silly. Yeah, like I have read articles that are really not far off at in construction Publications. And so yeah, I mean talking about that the Scout of be something of interest to people listening if you're in the construction industry and you have to Source labor, I know that's something We experienced here. Yeah, how do we find talented people get them here retain them train them the way we do things and then leave and effective team. Even if you're a labor in you know in the workforce right now, this could be encouraging to you, you know, and maybe you could start looking at things that you do in a different way that hey maybe I can leverage this. Maybe I can leverage these skills that I have to build up a business, too. Fit in to that that missing piece in our industry. Maybe you can digital. Yeah, maybe you can just realize that you are a valuable part of the industry. You are. Yeah and that your commodity it's hard work, but we appreciate everybody out there doing that every single day. Yeah stay at it. Yeah. All right guys, well, we're going to go ahead and move along and we're going to get into our episode with Tyler Gray. All right, Tyler. Thanks for joining us today.	1.0
Why don't you tell us who you are and what you do is I work for a company called Decima Corporation or a boutique Professional Services firms that provides Consulting and investment banking services to the built environment. We defined the built environment is is anything that really touches or Relates to the bill world, we work with contractors. We work with Engineers Building Product manufacturers construction material producers on the investment banking side of our business. We are helping companies transition ownership either internally within their own organizations or through m&a activity and doing buy sell or sell side representation and on the Consulting side of our business where I reside our Consulting business really provides, Advisory services in the areas of leadership strategy and performance, you know, I help lead our performance practice. I've been with FMI now for eight years and most of my time is spent in the market working with contractors. And so probably 200 days out of the year. I'm somewhere in North America sitting in the contractor's office helping them solve challenges relative to the performance of their organization.	1.0
I'm interested in what you call prefabrication modularization because from my reading on your background and the things that you're studying out it would seem that you have much larger projects in view than are in view. Typically when we're talking like a modular bathroom solution and so prefabricated and modular Solutions. Like how big are we talking? Like? What would be an example of a large prefabricated? Element.	1.0
Yeah, so we that's a really great question and you depending on who you ask and Industry you get different answers around that, you know for your commercial guys. They're looking at you know, what can be what could be marginalised in a commercial building. Right? And so that really speaks to things like bathroom pods or you know, anything with a bed really is replicable. So if you think about multifamily product launching even health care hospitals mean one of my clients ones don't The hospital is really just a hotel with Med guess and so it's it's maybe a little bit more complex modularization, but that is really where we think of modularization on the on the commercial side of things on the on the industrial side of things because the downtime is so expensive and an industrial environment. There is a much more incentive to explore off-site construction and push the boundaries of what could really be accomplished through modulars. Ation, and so the modules that you are seeing in the industrial environment are massive large to the extent where some of them can't even be trucked in other being shipped down rivers or up rivers or across oceans, you know from one side of the world to the other massive ships. You're seeing this very very large Mega units modulized units and it's because of the complexity of the work in the preciousness of So time in that industry in oil and gas to wear weeks mean millions of dollars for an operation and if I'll that can be constructed in another facility either in another state on the other side of the globe and be shipped in just in time to be put in place with minimal disruption to operations. That's really the advantage.	1.0
Yeah, we're talking barges with 50 tons of steel substructure and process piping Etc going down the river. Ever to be installed at a plant.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, and there's been and so I think when you think about particularly in this audience, the construction users Roundtable, which is comprised of a lot of industrial owners. All side says something they're pretty familiar with and it's really their conversations are how do we continue to push the envelope? How do we do more of it? And how do we get the rest of the industry on board namely contractors and I think - real space is an area where owners have really been leaders and that regard because the incentives are there two things off site or as maybe you look at the commercial side of the industry where commercial owners have kind of said well contractors can go figure it out. And if you can deliver a building faster or cheaper through off-site construction, we'd be interested in contractors go. Okay, great. We're not Apple or Google and we'll have billions of dollars worth of R&D to go figure this out come up with a new mouse trap. So it's innovation in manufacturing and off-site construction is sort of limped along this some extent and the and the commercial space because there's been a lack of funding or interest or incentives on either contractors around or side on the big stuff.	1.0
What's the biggest challenge and implementing off-site construction prefabrication? Is it just Logistics? Is it insurances? Is it illegal? Here's the thing. What is the common thing people? Stop their toe on?	0.0
Well, I think what we've noticed and talking when owners and studying. This is just a lack of vision at the onset of the project if owners and contractors alike are coming into a particular project opportunity and they're aligned on what possible from an off-site standpoint that really bodes well for maximizing the prefabrication or off-site potential on the project. It's I think it's what works hard as if there's a basic project that gets design and then a contractor or a contractor in a designer than says all right, what part of this can we can we manufacture off-site since having that alignment going in from the beginning with owner the engineer and a contractor all aligned saying this is this is really how we want to achieve this any kind of modular design any kind of prefabrication off-site construction really originates in the planning period of the construction process, right?	1.0
And so we're talking about getting alignment out of the people that initiates in the commercial space. We're just not seeing that alignment.	0.0
Is that what you're telling us a couple of the challenges that you have is the fragmentation of the market and you look at owners that say take a multi-family developer. For example, these may be small family offices that are throwing up maybe a couple of products every few years and they're not what we would Define as cereal buyers a construction services. And so when they go to develop a apartment Complex, they say right? What's the lowest cost that I can get this at the make the pro forma work not what would be the lowest cost at scale? If I was to build a thousand of these things some of your more your larger owners more Progressive owners think of a hotel flag like a Marriot. They are fully bought into the concept of modularization because I know they're going to be building hotels from now until the foreseeable future and the more cost-effective way. They can do that. They're interested in that and a big way. So at bathroom pain that's built in Miami or bathroom fathers built in Seattle. They're all for standardization Montreux zation and making their buildings more efficient from a construction standpoint because the scale and the dollars that have Place think of the same thing for somebody like a Facebook or Google that's going to be investing in billions of dollars worth of data centers over the next decade. Those are the folks that are really lean in same. All right, if we're able to save one percent on Ten billion dollars worth of construction that's real dollars that that that's a conversation. We're worth having if it's a fifteen million dollar apartment complex that only means, you know 1% of that to one owner. It doesn't get a whole lot of attention and when you see the magnitude of dollars that are spent on a sort of capex and the industrial face those are big dollars and the opportunity time the down time relative to construction or maintenance in those plants has big dollar. As well, so it's really the magnitude of the opportunity that gets people's attention. Otherwise, it's just something neat to talk about, you know, can we build something offsider prefab and slide and employees great. But what does that mean for either the economics of the project itself or the overall business?	1.0
I'm gonna play dumb here minute and trust me. It's not going to take too much work. Thanks Lane capex to me. You said capex explain that to me.	0.0
I'm just capital expenditure. So Investments that are made by businesses into property plant and equipment. So real assets that are either either viewed as new construction or additions to existing assets capex is big-time and industrial space, you're talking billions of dollars for you know, the large energy providers of the folks that are in oil refinery businesses or Midstream transmission oil and gas in there's a lot of dollars at play there. And so When you when you have a program of construction the stretches billions of dollars you start to look at that holistically as to how can we improve our productivity our efficiency are cost particular when you have repeatable structures and repeatable product type. How can we become more efficient of that over time? And that's really where off-site construction becomes really attractive.	1.0
I read where you'd said the big disconnect many of today's capital projects our Enos driven not execution driven. What did you what did you mean by that statement?	0.0
Yeah, so that really ties to a lot of the research that we've been doing over the last three years on what we call mega-projects mega-projects find US capital intensive projects that require multiple teams pull off and they usually in excess of a billion dollars that we've seen have created lots of stress on the industry and on stakeholders within the industry owners designers. And and contractors and what we mean by you know, those the challenge for those projects being business-driven is going to take a large NFL stadium. For example, we have some sort of deadline that we've established for the stadium open probably based on kickoff of game one a couple Seasons from now and so we've got to figure out how to pull together the capital and power the contractor to the designed to get that accomplished within a another find window not necessarily. Taking the other crochet if we were going to build a structure like this, logically and efficiently, how long would it take? You know, we may be three season from now that that Stadium would logically be open and could be built in a way that the the labor market could provide sufficient labor. The contractors could do sufficient planning. The designer would have enough time to thoroughly designed the building to the extent that it's ready to be constructed by a contractor. It's the business pressures and that's just one example, you can apply that to really any project where there's a economic outcome a reason why they're every every project as an impetus for being constructed and if it's a private project because the return on investment the people are looking for if it's a public project is that there's a public use right and and those deadlines are driven by really the reasoning behind them project and that's very well understandable, but I think some of those deadlines of expectations but the public eye and from a business TenPoint have outstripped the capacity the construction industry to deliver on those expectations. And that's where we really see challenges. So back to the stadium example, we want to build a stadium in two years great. We don't have the local label Market to support it. We don't have time to pull the design together and we would stress the contractor Community to build it but we're going to try to do it anyways and roll the dice and see what happens and sometimes when you see favor welcomes, but more and more on these large projects. We are seeing unfavorable outcomes for all stakeholders involved.	0.0
Stood in the statements you were making about Syria being a suit serial Builder and I've heard it said in the past and I believe this was amongst commercial users that 90% of the things that are built are built by a one-time owner. I don't know that I could substantiate those statistics at this point because that's probably 10 to 12 years old in anecdotal at best. But are you seeing that as kind of the Difference Maker it seems like that's what picture you paint. That's the Difference Maker between a large industrial users is that they've got the capital in the know how to plan? Whereas these commercial users that are in there from one time. They don't have the capital to know how or the care because the savings aren't large enough to go into it with a mentality of we're going to prefabricate. We're going to modularize we're going to do off-site construction. Is that fair to say?	0.0
Yeah. I think the stakes are much higher and the industrial environment. It's on the business disruption side. So lost Revenue, Related to construction activity. That's a huge driver as well as just the magnitude of their construction spin. So they're looking at it from both sides right there looking at it from how long is it going to take to construct this new plant or retrofitting existing plant? And what's the overall cost of construction services that I'm going to you know that I'm gonna spend on construction services over the next 10 years and and they are capital planning on that type of arising Capital planning in commercial. Environments tends to be a shorter Horizon. And so that also then also challenges how we think about Innovation and work programs in things that we can do to make the construction delivery process more effective like off-site construction. And I also think the dollar spent is smaller as well. Like you said you might have one off buyers or Construction Services or even if they're not one off they may build a project every five years. So you're essentially are a one-off type Builder or they're planning Horizon is Noah's law. So if Multi family developer or Builder cash right now. You're probably saying I hope I hope the music keeps playing for another 24 36 months and I'm running out this wave of multifamily boom, and I'm not really quite sure where this Market will be five years from now, whereas oil and gas and petrochemical owners there. They've got a 10 15 20 year view on the capital spent where that's going.	0.0
It feels like there's a lot that can be learned. I mean these Mega projects let's go in That a little bit just the percentage of construction that's going to be done that's represented by Mega projects in the coming years.	1.0
Yeah, that's a great point. And one of the things we've noticed is it's been uh, it's been small single digits over the past in 15 plus years and we're projecting it to climb to almost a third of the construction starts in terms of dollars spent and that's a that is a huge shift in the way in which projects are built and it's In amount of large projects and the challenges they're becoming is proliferation of these large projects and the experience on them is largely bad from a cost standpoint from a schedule standpoint. We are seeing as I mentioned this at the Kirk conference from our point of view and working with contractors. We're seeing lots of what I will call voluntary exits from a space. So contractors that are saying we've gotten into these large projects we've had bad. Experiences we've lost a ton of money in the case of some public companies. We've lost a lot of Share value and we are strategically pivoting out of that market and we are going to go find work elsewhere. Well what other contractors participate in the reproductive and then there are you know, sort of what I've referred to as the involuntary exits is we have seen a lot of in the past 24 months is contractor bankruptcies, even for some of the largest companies in our industry that go belly-up as a result of being involved. These big projects that get sideways and they can they can take down even even a really large contractor.	1.0
So very interesting. I'm curious me. Yep. You've got your fingers on the pulse of this industry from the standpoint of what's coming and going what we're going to see in the coming years. What are you interested in?	1.0
Like, what's got you entry what's got you peaked right now really interested to see, you know, we get asked all the time. When as the recession coming in we were on the largest expansion Area Cycle from a building. Environment standpoint that we've ever been on in kind of recorded history. And so everyone's waiting for the other shoe to drop and for there to be some sort of Market pull back, but barring any sort of mega event. We don't see a giant monolithic downward shift in the construction industry happening like in 2008 where the music just stopped overnight. We do see pockets of the industry from a sector level and a geographic level that will begin softening, you know at different rates. I'm going to different times but I'm most interested to see how contractors react to that change and markets and I think contractors this time around have been more sobered and more cautious and maybe more paranoid than contractors were in a seven and a way where if you flash back to 2007 times were good. There wasn't a lot of people that were scared of a downturn and then boom all of a sudden. We were caught in a new reality. I think you flash forward to today and it's almost the opposite mentality that we see in the marketplace where as people are constantly paranoid about when the market is going to ship that they're thinking about today how to prepare their Organization for living in a different tomorrow is so so we have we have a lot more confidence. I would say from a broad sense that the contractor Market is much more prepared to deal with a recession than they were in. Seven or at least they thought about it and planned about it more now. It's still probably be painful for some but I think the construction in secret could probably use a slight pullback for the amount of stress that's out there right now on labor markets for my stress. It's on contractor balance sheets currently as they're trying to execute all this work slight cooling off period although I don't never with the recession on on any industry or any economy a slight cooling off period could actually be a chance. Or the construction industry in North America to catch its breath.	0.0
Where do you see a softening up? I'm real Curious and that's all that's sounds to me on the surface like pretty good news. But where do you see it softening?	0.0
Yeah, so and that is that is also really based on where you are in the country that we see in certain markets where you've had over expansion particularly multifamily. We do see it maybe not cooling off as the Word, but returning to normal, so Manhattan is a great example of this the multi-family residential boom in Manhattan. They were the let them in the market has doubled over the last five points there. And so it's going to pull back it's going to come back off of highs from probably probably do the extent to 25 30 30 percent decline of construction put in place, but it's still going to be a big building Market. It's just going to pull back quite a bit and it won't be as crazy competition will be fiercer DC star. Going to pull back a little bit in terms of Spin and so in certain Pockets where you can wrap intention Nashville's a great example, we've had rapid expansion over the last several years. We see a leveling off and maybe even a slight pullback, but you're also seeing a rotation and Healthcare sector fewer and fewer large sort of bed Tower Hospital projects coming out of the ground seeing a shift towards more. If you look at spaces like Hospitality hotels are going up all over the place, but the economy is good. Some people can afford to travel and so who broke warmest support the fact that what we've got more Travelers we ought to have more Hotel Beds.	0.0
We always kind of wrap up here with the same question. If you had a megaphone and you could speak to the whole construction industry and tell them the best thing, you know, and you had 60 seconds to do it. What would you say the best thing that I know project selectivity?	1.0
I think this kind of weaves into a lot of things that we've talked about today. We work with hundreds of contractors every year and we see the whip statements see the balance sheets. You see the income statements and otherwise good or excellent year for a contractor can be wiped out by one or two bad projects. And if you wind the tape back on those one or two bad projects there was probably a lot of warning signals that happened during the pursuit phase as to it was a project larger than we've ever built. Or was a new owner that we've never worked with or gosh at a time. We didn't think we quite had the team to do it and she's like a culmination of a lot of those factors that result in a really bad project and for contractors projects from my margin standpoint for my project Sim profit standpoint can go marginally better, but they can go infinitely worse. And if I had a megaphone to speak to the construction industry would be to really hone in. In on Project selectivity particularly now at the top of the market cycle when there's more opportunity than there has been in recent years and contractors. I think have I will say the luxury of being more selective being more intentional about the types of work that they take on what Tyler thanks for being with us today. Thank you. It's been a pleasure.	1.0
Hey guys, Tyler here. Thank you so much for joining us today. I would point you to a couple things before you go as always look at the show notes. For any links to our guests, and you'll be able to find links to every single one of our social accounts. So you can click that go like our page and get involved in the conversations that we're having their. If you have any ideas of something that you want us to go chase something that you want us to talk about hit us up send Eddie and I have message. We would really appreciate it. So you guys have a great week. We'll catch you later.	1.0
Hello and welcome back to the talk unit walls podcast. We're here for podcast number 12, and we are here to review obviously the games that happen in November alongside. Cheers time talking to the my queen. Hey, I'm checking on fine. I'm fine could barely a levels. Are we going to be reviewing the games from November? And of course we could actually be talking about a team of the decade as well. But as always, my name is Dave a long. So I've been here is Tom y'all got the black Tom? How's it going?	1.0
Great. Thanks.	1.0
Good make good. I like your hat.	1.0
Cheers mate brush it rocking the Daniel Powter.	1.0
Obviously. We have got MacKeeper Matt dying and the callings just about and our special guest today is none other than mr. Harry Mansell.	1.0
Hello Mary. Thanks. Thanks.	1.0
Which one is it?	1.0
We've got some sound effects like Steve Wright in the afternoon. Thank you very much.	1.0
So, how are you? Of course, you've come I think we felt sorry for you in the last there's always water. Okay. There we go. In the last podcast. We took I'm pretty sure we took the McHale.	1.0
Yeah, I didn't mind it was funny.	0.0
It was a shit show that it was I on I ain't joking.	0.0
I generally thought you were really good and then when I put it on foot picture on Twitter, absolutely. Yeah, I'm or Fashions terrible. But when I will stop there in a while it wasn't that bad.	0.0
Maybe it was just it was just horrendous. Yeah, it was right. We are going to be kicking off with well actually the Bratislava game, but the home time Wolves of course ended up winning that game one goal to nil to rely on a stoppage time winner from him and as I mean, it was pure domination, but it was one of those games Thomas. You can remember it werewolves just couldn't seem to break through. Yeah, they go keep ready pretty good games.	0.0
But yeah, you made a good saves and we played quite well throughout the game, but it just took a lot of patience to build to break them down. And then because that horrific injury that took 10 minutes out of the game gave us the extra time to go to get the goal that we needed but ironically	0.0
- Cody as well.	1.0
Yeah, but but he put his hands together. So, you know, yeah, it makes it all better specs but I got to be honest.	1.0
It's that long ago Dave and I was just my fault.	0.0
It's your podcast me.	1.0
Anyway. All right, Matt. Do you remember the game all yeah, it was it was it was really frustrating in I think it was one of those those games that we've seen previously where we did. I think we would have played or not and not scored or just never look like leave. Again, it came in the 92nd 93rd minute. Yeah, 12 minutes and I'm very very very light is the Fantastic header. What a late that was the other similar chance today against Sheffield United worries a lot of standing jump or not jump Center off. It's a great leap. And yeah, it was good obviously very important to get the three points now that now that we've qualified so that's all that really matters isn't it rather than the performance the trailer I put the ball in for?	1.0
Yeah, it might ease Souls water wet.	1.0
He's awesome. And he's a real ability though. If it is something that he's really showing off a little bit more this year some of the haters and he's got a couple of them this year. We very rarely get what balls into the box I deliver.	1.0
Yeah, Troy puts a line any try. All right.	1.0
He's already and Border. Yeah, there was of those a point today where we've got two players overlapping on the wing and I looked in the box and there's approximately zero players and their strict him just comes out a lot and yeah, very rarely. Give me exact.	1.0
Getting the cross yesterday and we'll move on from that game all unless are you going to have just been really boring but atmosphere and yeah, I read kicked him in the are 12 and it's added on and we got the goal. Drink should have listened enough for that night's an accident. I think it's did it was unlucky to get a yellow card for it. And he said yeah. Hey it's dangerous, but it's all read them. Yeah, like you say their keeper was good. And I thought they just played at their skin, which is a big game for them with coming tomorrow their fans. We have mentioned their fans. They were amazing. Yeah. Yeah, everybody said they were genuinely the best fans. I think I've ever seen him on you.	1.0
Please probably about 500 upstairs and downstairs and all these, you know, the reputation of racist chant in and just been Ultras and stuff like that and have come out with these chance and then they followed with yeah.	0.0
I was thinking that needs to be that needs to be introducing. I absolutely loved it.	1.0
It was great.	1.0
Let's load that stuff into the kind of yeah, I'll obviously thought that was full of kids. They're not mad at the sphere.	1.0
I thought that Phantom earlier Tom with a couple weeks go up against Aston Villa 2-1 win. Obviously Reuben Eva's score in the opener him and his more. Let's put in the game to bed before trezeguet got that consolation goal Matt. It was a massive one wasn't it though? That's first off performance. Probably the best I've seen as right ever. Yeah.	1.0
It was since the last time we played ever. Hope. That's the that's the maybe man united in the cup holders in there that holds the plastic plastic.	1.0
But yeah. Was great. It was doc said probably the best I've seen apply especially especially under Noona if we just take our chances are many times. I need to keep saying and that game would have been out of sight and in the second half we wouldn't have happened. Well, it obviously would have happened but you know, we put ourselves under a lot of pressure in that second half a lot of unneeded pressure. Is that deeper and deeper which have been conscious of in the past few seasons. Anyway, I Watford New Year if I could Braga. Yeah, so it yeah, the first off was great should have put the going to bed, but it's one of those Delivered when it was terrible probably the worst team us. I've seen this either. I'm not just saying that because of the villa and there are local Royal.	0.0
I was really disappointed by John begin because I thought was going to be a property. But yeah, he did turn exactly battle between McKinnon and routine you but yeah, yeah. Well when they show you one just didn't tell the story did it we could have beat him up five one on the day really and five shots on target is Philip. I think Villa did Miss grealish, but they were so bad. I mean they do today. I looked at that I thought yeah, they're getting relegated in. It's the best of sin tree or a human hairs and jata combined. I thought they're absolutely lethal and obviously Doherty and Johnny and they're like we say like you got to be scoring up the score more the chance and yeah, that's it had to a good was there never is his goal. I thought it's been really clever at the time I said because I said to my dad this is going to be s a very respectable to come in this coming out to neighbors and it happened and I was thought I was the best thing ever to put that on there and then people said, let's do it on the radio and they're going Everyone in the ground could see what then is you can do but I did leave any words. I mean never sees my very much all the boxes left him on his own very naively little run up the knee little shimmy Runner. Here we go. Great finish. It's almost like and today there's a couple of times. It's like watching rugby where you wait for the man in the pocket for a drop goal the end of the game where we none of you know, but I might there will be one person watching. Who knows. Thanks, Dad.	0.0
Well, I was going to ask if I mean the back free I think that was one of the first times really we saw Cody then Duncan say sort of look pretty pretty solid. I know we've had previous games. We've spoke about it the Arsenal game and so on but forward touch on it now before we move on to the next game, how do you lot think that I know they didn't play that back for you today? But how do you lot think we've adjusted? Life without Willie Bali as well because I personally think it's doing a lot better than what I am.	1.0
Anyway, I think that Danka he's pretty much saved us about doesn't he like they slide in has been unreal. I was really worried and we know we can play there. But yeah, I'm real seis on the left. I think when Polly comes back I don't be harsh and then dunker I would just slap body back and on the right. So he's remembering its besiktas away using real that game. So you have to fair play to Dent Anka. I mean like I say he saved us because I was really worried when body got injured, but the way he slaughtered in has been incredible. I think I'll come over for said it last time but but I think we look better going forward with those to the back because they bring the ball in to Midfield don't like a bit more fluid than previously we retain possession a lot better as well so far.	0.0
I'm not going to sing a lot Bennett but a lot of the time it is you never did. No you are right, but those two are and Cody the Freer and natural with the ball at the fit. They're all they're all midfielders. So it's natural that we are going to retain possession better under distribution is going to be better. I mean the out ball is a lot better, especially Block then Duncan part of his leftovers, right? So yeah, I think we've adjusted seamlessly tight body's not even not even gone but even got he's got to come back straight to the team.	1.0
They asked yeah, especially that best defender model only. I'm real even kill many think is just a really well. Yeah definitely has already promised big pressure on him as well and they're coming into that. I could have gone but you don't feel like we're going on the ball. Whereas if I lay eyes on the ball, I'm twitching like get it off him and he just passed it out money for a phone seems like that that bothering them.	1.0
Yeah, that might be cut short in. Everybody's hands as well. But yeah, I think we've killed mean obviously with him being that Futsal player. They're going to be quite good on the ball and so on. I think you look really comfortable especially today is Sheffield United even with the aerial Jules. I didn't do too badly will give you books up a little bit which will happen. Naturally. It could be a really good player because positioning and that he's got the they've got the football brain. You can say that it's just physically he's it isn't found a little bit wanting still but he's a big boy, and he thought I said I put a bit of size and I'm like the dummy of the pies are never as you look at pictures from when they saw into. Yeah, probably Officer I don't even in size.	1.0
So if they did that we killman, but the we did that would cost her and then he turned out to be his first awful easiest and in these amazing on the other hand as well like they're itchy, but Doherty's gone from being like overweight and then being like athlete who is spoilers for brewing a bad word. Sorry Danny if you listening	0.0
Probably should have been a lot more than what the score lines suggested to one win in the end. Material on him in is getting the first half goals second half goal for Bournemouth Steve Cook and a red card in the first half as well for France's pure. From wolves Tom it should have been more though.	0.0
Yeah, well as much alluded to earlier on with giving the goals away too easily. We're not killing games off and that's why we against against Braga and the next game should have been out of sight really but I was actually here when that game was going on and then drove back listen to on the radio and I just said it just makes the come back for the form of even more amazing when they inevitably come back in two days. You didn't know that there was one that was going to give it away at some point we Play well for 90. It was very similar to The Villa guy absolutely battered of their staff from one of our best performances with Villa and then they get a man set off as well. So I'm thinking what is going to absolutely annihilate him second half but they seem to up their game with yeah - we just I don't know what happened. But that goal from a teeny. Oh, you think it was across that? Yeah, I think mentees you think I think he meant. Well you did it again today. Maybe it's going to become his thing is that he can score from these ridiculous tight angles, but he just sits right?	0.0
Yeah. That was that was definitely a shot. Shaq deal anyway if that was a cross it's an awful cross piece. It's loaded. Absolutely everyone look at the height on it and how he dips. It's not that's not cross. Its. I mean it don't matter.	0.0
What is it that an audacious so good. I thought you meant it because it's probably one of them things.	1.0
I'll just Whack It In The Box and if I don't hello, I'm home Mom Walk In The Box and hopefully someone gets a touch on it. Yeah, that's what I think. It's a shot. He's far too clever to just whack it racquetball across the area.	0.0
I don't know if a player like that shoot it from that angle. It does. I can't see why you would try to score from there.	0.0
That's why I think that's why I think it's official the video of him taking free kicks in training not from that angle.	1.0
This part is quite small pitch anymore.	1.0
Yeah, he's quality and I mean he's taking a lot of the set pieces now head of Never As I think his I mean even that one in Sevilla, and we're never scored I think That was now it seems to only be taking them if it's like director for your goal. So you see he could get the dip on the shots really well, but matino seems seems to be the man. Now you have a goal as well obviously was him in his goal. Yeah material again with a set-piece a Dharma will across him heroin.	1.0
It makes me better at loving money fast. Yeah another great question and the way you opened up his body him and asked us to tapping of your left foot and he's on fire any at the moment scoring all those schools, but he's got a The the balls coming in.	1.0
Yeah and trial rights get that first time. He's like to go from standing to false full pelt in a couple of seconds. Yeah, it absolutely roasted. Harry Wilson.	0.0
It's been a couple of goals like that that have just shown everything that's good about our attacking play within two or three seconds. And then we score a goal everything from that goal was perfect and showed bettina's class and think a quick-thinking tray. All right is showing that he's on the same page everybody else now and making that run and human has his His and product from compared to last year particularly good like I'm real and and if you notice all writing about 85% of the time we attacked on the right now because I think of some Jolly Joe or on the other white did that much today really was always going down the right way to take some imagery.	1.0
We are we are productive player that we've got everything comes on that right? I'm sorry links it really well with Doc. Yeah, definitely sees come on Leaps and Bounds and it's it looks a different player. I'll speak to some of them. Actually they saying he carries on this form. He's Rich goal scoring and assists for how much is it going to be worth it and somebody said that 18 million pounds now for a play like that.	1.0
It looks like an absolute bargain us. I think I think you can come and 30 million for him.	1.0
Definitely 30 million. Counter-attack jotter on the left him initially the right Adama was the deepest man back. Why is you know, why is he I mean to be their defensive Duty wise I think you did. Okay today, like he was actually tracking back a little bit more. But again going forward today could he could have genuinely wants that game if you want.	1.0
I guess he must be a nightmare to mark because the our easy it is from set to take along. It's so incredible sometime when the Villa game for the second goal loads of villa fans ringing up to W. I'm saying why didn't he tell Garcia's all one of their players say, whiny just take one? Just take him out body. Dim. Just get erect take a red card below then, you know things didn't they Ming's talking about for their freaking legendary? She's got all right moving on. Sorry. Did you go did you go to Braga boys move on. We don't mention jotters offside. That wasn't offside going as ball. Oh, yeah, like how the hell they are the block the boat flags for it straight away. If you keep slack down VAR check, it goes to college not Did you see John again Maddie you line him and some very similar thing happened today as well didn't it? But it was the referees for for blowing the whistle.	0.0
Well, it's Simon who lines because it's not offside. Yeah. It's a referee's decision. You have to blow the whistle when the phase of play is stopped because you can carry on and school like he did not what that's not OV.	0.0
I think he originally blue she fought him and as was offside when I originally went into him as they have a job what it was but he was on the line.	1.0
Oh, so this city season only put you through I'll give you a hundred. Yeah, close hundred percent sure because if you see that flag go up and your Defender you think yeah Rana flags up, but that's still go through and that's why that that's the linesman's for want to blame the rest of that because you've got to trust you linesman fully you're not going to be very rare that you ignore the law. But that's what the protocol is. No don't don't blow the show. You shouldn't the blown he it's more the lines for Russian flag. He shouldn't flag because how's the ref going to know if you click it obvious in the ref, let's hit play on. He's got a truck driver makes a question with offside.	0.0
You need linesman. It was let me I'll check it. Once your mean. Do you need more chips in the balls to put on the boots lines on the pitch lasers? That's what we want.	1.0
Now. We are moving onto braggart on. I'm City girl a really good time. Thanks to one football preparing the PIP implants and crazy jealous to not just have a senior.	1.0
What has happened to my YouTube channel like that comment somebody commented on one of the poems that I put on said what has happened to this chip? I think you're quite talented Tom talented.	1.0
Which one they match today one. Did you he's very well spoken very eloquently put together.	1.0
Is no way that somebody compared it to under milk wood by Dylan Thomas very clearly.	1.0
You uncultured one of the greatest Welsh poems and I'll call ya video Braga to be there. We'll do it. So she bruised man.	0.0
I'm sorry shows you Bruce police officers were beaten up in bra was like that cheering. Is it nah? Well if they would have we're documenting his job because he's been everywhere.	0.0
Yeah anyway. Hey, everybody was good. For example football. Send us there. You know what it was great. When I think it was ridiculous that the weather, you know, it's like it go to Portugal be no set time here. It's November. All right now all day. Yeah, it'll be mild and it was it just I don't think we stepped outside and it was dry at any given point. So but apart from that lovely evening.	1.0
Yeah, he's got the other way the worst tropical. Yeah.	0.0
The worst thing was the day like the day after the Friday when we were flying back. Back, it was still the same weather in Porto. So everyone obviously again on the plane the couple of jackets big coat and then we flew to Lisbon before flying back to England and Lisbon was like 20 degrees. So you get out the flipping trivial I transfer you sweating will you like panicking when they pitch inspection that was happening?	0.0
There wasn't a pictures.	0.0
Yeah, which was terrible. We saw it and I thought like it was some some your dad that put it up and everyone was just getting smashed on super box. I'll go to here who's had one Supermarket told are going I searched pitch inspection on Twitter and it was just all these people tagging Spears and Joe Edwards asking in terms of pitch him inspection and said that they spoke to the locals about it and I just laughed it off so District, this is actually gonna be used to this at that time here.	0.0
Anyway, so a lot better when there's a 6000 also probably won't Mobile's fans are then I ran out of holiday so I can go I was good. I do I was a bit worried, but everyone does seem to prioritize that my brother and I thought Brian I didn't really work.	0.0
so star we've I wanted to I didn't really want to do right because I think I was looking at Bishop Tyson that obviously when one football game	1.0
Relationship between Portugal yeah, he's been historically quite good wasn't there. I don't know if you want me to say this on a but they were never walls running but all the novels and on this. Yeah.	0.0
Yeah apparently knocked him out. And if it's maybe it was stolen afterwards so cute.	0.0
He's all right.	1.0
Yeah. Well, I mean hearing what happened. I don't think he will be but nah, it's not good that but and we and we well, we've always said that touch wood so far.	0.0
Everything has been going. Well, no trouble anywhere. And then this trip but as soon as you to start going line treatment, yeah, no children cheer.	1.0
Yay, the Crusaders just waiting for the next round draw for us to get standard liège. Imagine around on Copenhagen soul back into the term expensive.	0.0
I want I've Aroma or PSV not in the next round. You want not because of the team. I just want to go even them a bit later.	1.0
Going to get to Roma no stab you like Gladiators in the Colosseum.	0.0
Yeah, there is a far-right chanting.	1.0
So should we talk about the game? What game? Oh, yes. Well, we probably 75% of the fans anyway and missed the first two goals because of the police so ensuring so we're in the queue and Emmas on One Note Down good evening. We're outside the grinding of the Braga fans or anything. We want.	0.0
Yeah, we get towards it even has a scored and yeah Finn has missed it.	0.0
So many things wrong so the game itself, obviously Braga took an early lead through a deflected goal through Andre jota jiminez, then equalized Doherty and adharma quickly made it 3-1 walls and the second half. We sort of collapse and it's paleo and Francis. Yo, I gotta go.	0.0
He's in the start side four shots on target Regal that first goal of the bloke who shot his best mates Endeavors. And yeah, Man doesn't come off nervous to go in.	1.0
Yeah, and then obviously they're him in his dhoti and Adama golfing The Pick of those for me is probably that Doty got in that that ball from the cross from Johnny Johnny always cuts in and use his left foot once great cross good editor good.	1.0
Yeah another good hitter try all he's got his values you should have said It was wet like how you looked at that while she was saying but it was a good strike sword isn't bad.	1.0
Yeah. I'll set you off Tom Ford want you calling it for one week Houston absolutely coast and another five or four more.	1.0
I thought I knew that the bride will get back into it because I've seen this ID singles played before. I don't know what happened. You just wait awful a single doors. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I just couldn't taking that but but to be 3-1 up in to give it away is very very disappointing.	0.0
I think it Obviously took it away at to go ladies disappointed but I think because a point qualified US yeah don't think it really that didn't really take much away from it. People aren't I wasn't I was dozing that way they do that. So yeah, I think yeah, I got a good side though.	0.0
I think we should offensively we were we were too cautious am on you isn't it was just after we lost to Chelsea and we were playing five three two, and is really negative.	0.0
Should apply for the back.	1.0
No, I think we should have you all three. That's that's seems to be working at the moment think that Chomp control damage to Citizen. Yeah, remember and then Bennett mess anything up in it.	0.0
I'll now we will move on it to the game. We are recording in the currently on Sunday right after the game because Sheffield United's are going to be talking a little bit more about that. It disastrous start for going one-nil down lease say set score in the first minute goal and then Matt Doherty equalizing in the end in the second half. Half Harry would you recognize this game is strange when I think I don't think device I did enough to win the game.	0.0
But it's yeah sloppy by both teams only really two teams in good form, obviously and Sheffield United the way they're set up to be fair to and was good. They were dirty the ref had a nightmare like give her out more bookings a shocking. Yeah, so but they sell really well and to go one-nil down of hard God. Here we go, but we grew into its second after we got we got better and better about and in the end we probably could have we could have won it but you think back to the mat chances though that Sheffield United out of what we look quite shake it the back.	0.0
All four times the fries are great. They look good on the ball, but I actually think that that I don't actually think they have that many that many many chances in themselves. They lose.	0.0
Okay going forward called Rick mccubbin even for your few times in the end.	1.0
I don't just really 42nd. I'll be forced to yeah, I think I think Kris world has settled it for the drawer there. Anyway, I mean they were	0.0
Ferdinand Villas described a few light draws and we Burnley yeah, I mean if you take those all the drawers that we've had eight Drew more than anybody else in the league if you'd just be in picking Southampton or Newcastle or today or Burnley or one of those games, we would genuinely be top four contenders. And this season is a little bit like the 1516 season where it is up for grabs here live following the league already City or finished up for Spurs might get top for because Marina will just bore the and so pretty and gets the win last minute Lester. I've got a good chance but there's such turmoil amongst United and Arsenal and Chelsea with fat Frank. They can't guarantee that he's going to finish top four. So why can't we with our stable stable, you know behind the scenes and everything push for that and we got a little break from Europa League now. Yes, it's a so and we're well, I think we're only five points away now after today's point, but We should have really been trying to win today. And then we did though Trilogy when we were going through the end to try and get I think we actually played really well today second half we did first office. So I think if he took the first minute of the game, I think we were the first minute. Yeah, generally if we just to the first minute, I think we played really well generally was gonna make it off yourself and you can see it in the first minute though Jim why you think we can see it in the first minute still asleep because we were playing that we changed end because we kicking towards the South Bank First rather than the North Bank. I genuinely thought oh, my dad actually said I thought that he said this is going to confuse them and they're going to start shakily. He said that and then they can see them the first we lose the tops of the mr. Dunn because like we always do when we go to anfield and we win the toss week making the top attack. The cop first is a you know, and and then as the game is going on the first half of there's 15 minutes left in the first half and I felt like we had to score because we were going towards the South bank. I'll be honest. I don't even know so first time because he always used to be	1.0
He was a yeah.	1.0
Yeah, Kenny jackett changed it.	1.0
But yeah, I've just been very rare very yeah, he's very rare thing when you can't blame those teams picked used to kick rather than swap sighs, you know, so yeah, I think today was will struggle to live with Sheffield, you know is energy levels. They were they were every second ball. They will get it and perhaps they are the a little bit hungover from first the people say the professional athletes playing two games in a week. She'll be an excuse. It's not an excuse to you come up against professional athletes or implied. At all in the way. Yeah, so there is going to be he's a difference there. But I thought Jeff Ward United in terms of how they play with pretty poor. It was direct. He's running the channels. It was it was crap football, but it's so effective not the only game where you look alike. They goal kicks. They push everyone up they make the volcano literally all the players were probably 10 10 meter radius of each other because they know they're going to win that second ball and I can get more they so much the second door.	0.0
Belgium son's voice we should go to match their energy level of charm Light trailer over and done the wing as well. He had a free blokes on him every time he did once I come on obviously got a few balls in but mad they remind me a lot of when Wigan first came up or when black ball first came up and they've got that on my God. I can't believe we're in the Premier League. Let's just run like mad all the time and they are getting tired in games. That's why they threw away a lead against man you died last week. They obviously got tired today throughout the last 20 minutes. They would really jaded and that's when we were getting better. Better and better and that's why we are you know, that's why we score so many late goals because we are so fit and we can keep on going experience and we display the same in the first minutes we do in the 90s when you think as well. I think you said about us like planning Europe. I results after playing in Europe already good. I don't think that's the way man see we've had a few of she draws in there, but I'm not thinking David McCall drink go.	1.0
Me in football manager versus Ebola Burton Albion from liters of the Premier League and I like we did we did struggle so too much some for the their energy because I didn't they are at MacArthur would absolutely adore that exactly. Bipolar, if you'd brought this all on you probably want to do more than just her it could totally would've done more than him and there's no it's a bit concerning and I think they need to they will need to strengthen January and if new no does Stowe then we're no no studies.	0.0
They will check by having a bite the other one. He's clapping every standard. I was January. I was reloading all know. I don't think you'll go now. I know you'd be mad too. I was worried at one point because like you say no smoke without fire. When his favorite. I'm thinking on God, but got it we've had we've edited that bit out. Yeah, a bit of interesting chapter.	0.0
We could have gone to the bench today.	1.0
I brought net1 or control anybody or leak under who is the young man what little white lady look under that leaky played them. Yeah, I'm sorry leak be generally genuinely against PSG and one of the one of the kids said after the And he said he looked like he could be in our class. Yeah, because he was he's tiny but he was decent player. Do you sent him it was okay when we play a game?	1.0
So you all really excited about that Owen other Sally so against today's on the bed you do. He's an absolute decline. Yeah. He's a big audience a-wing backwards. Midfielder but dropped started using him as a Centre back.	1.0
So it's all works to bit like playing. We haven't he's very mobile.	1.0
Very White's contracts up at the end of the year though, and apparently all still living across from him.	1.0
And as I'm real cross when it for though is after the celebration he left a bit under a cloud.	1.0
It was rumors that he was already speaking with Stoke before What was its own demand? That was one of the reasons why let him go but every time we play Four Walls, he did really well and it's called lots of goals lots of important goals and to obviously hear that new style of so close. I love the phone you had a phobia on the back of one of my shirt the first line that's it 2015 beginning of 2015 that attack until Easter was the best attacking football. I just go if I miss a car man, I'm going to hold this field and choosing youth as well as the choosing on a Wednesday night and we had vampire. Terra di KO F OB soccer. Yeah, we just we just like crap defend. We talked about 71 our souls with the last time.	1.0
Drumstick and off as well. He's gonna get sent off you give even my dad found in the early on when he lost the ball. They got had to play it down. So the first minute it's apply some games you look he just got out of bed and he's so like doping did anyone see that someone put on Twitter of like a like a lizard run across the desert. Yeah then danke when he has called to come on.	1.0
Maybe she had a referee run as well proper locks all pail. Yeah. It was terrible today. Should I think it's David.	0.0
Usually I'm the referees but he was awful today that they should have had George Bulldog should have been sent off. That's insane. That's what I thought. Yeah, he was stung. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah fair enough. That's fine.	0.0
The first one you can check if the rest blowing the whistle.	1.0
No, you didn't blows whistle blows whistle. So the first one annoyed me because nobody in the ground chapter 4 penalty nobody in the South Bank called for penalty. No player put their hand up for a penalty yet. We have to stop the game and look at a screen that says check in penalties ages as well. I didn't know we didn't know if it was for handball or a push on top. Dirty or whatever it was. It really really fast rights for straight smooth.	0.0
ER it was good apparently check as well down the South Bank and John hoeven it yeah, we had a penalty kick as well. Do ya first time I'll definitely still we still haven't heard anything.	1.0
Go for a sinner. Yeah, but which either means that the second after season we're going to get a low six points given to us season. The Nevers goalie is money not even true. They would have rolled that out, Oregon man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.	0.0
Yeah. Yeah, right then we will now move on we were of quell quickly talk about the fixtures upcoming as well. So obviously another draw continuing the unbeaten run in the Premier League and now it's a pretty busy this Member schedule so walls are play West Ham midweek, right and next week. She kicked ass in our final Europa League group game and then going into a busy Christmas Pippi period Spurs Norwich City Liverpool and then Watford in New Year as well. So pretty hefty one Lads. I mean in terms of the next as I two games West Ham and brighten four to six points reveal.	1.0
If you look at them in isolation, we should win both of those games, but it's Wolves and it's in a series of games and I think if we took four points would be pretty up.	1.0
I think people have written West Ham off, but I have to make it really tough to watch especially against they were going to be full of confidence just have to waste time from last season turn up because out crap.	0.0
Yeah, we turn them over didn't really bad. Um, yeah, that's right best performance. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah. I think I think West Ham's going to be a really tough game. They're going to be G deep after the after the Chelsea when it and brighten as well under under Harry Potter that they've really turned a corner.	0.0
Corner, and I've given him what five or six-year deal screams around party went to that last year will be absolutely battered I've ever lost one. Now how we dance glimmery deflection?	0.0
I think they both could be tough to see how much is a it's a tough place to go. So four points is really stick and I think reasonable. Yeah, definitely. I don't know. It doesn't matter how they come with us a pointer or three points away. But yeah, I'd say four points, but after that it's we could have range from anything to zero point mean if we don't if you don't lose one of them was that we're gonna be 11.	0.0
Yeah, and when the parameter Right on over a lot of drawers in there, but it's some achievement. It's a quarter of the season. Nine games is a huge really hard to be. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, really sticking we always stay in games even when we're not playing particularly. Well if we're just one kneel down going into the last 20 minutes you feel like we've got a chance of getting at least a point. We got better and better don't music. Yeah.	1.0
It's a bit strange though this season because we're having really good 45-minute performances. It's frustrating its orbit. It's not always the first or second half. Season where first off we terrible. Yeah II RP great and then not taking Chief what you're not into account the past four or five games the first ask Ben grass second a spinning back is short.	0.0
So this one, you know, we said I think we mentioned last time that he's the whole thing that he keeps saying is that we can play well for spells, but we need to be able to play well for 90 minutes and we're not at that level yet. We're working towards its what yesterday and we're getting closer because it's not just a 45 minutes and then the second half there's a little crossover. A little you know about an hour or so we play well for now, but it's when we do play with and 90 minutes, I think will bloat.	1.0
Anyway, I think it's getting there but we're slamming and Brian are going to be tough games and no gimmes by any stretch of imagination on Amazon Prime minute West up.	0.0
I think so.	1.0
Yeah Christmas games. Is it never whole is it Liverpool - see ya then?	0.0
There's another One later in the season as well that they've announced they're going to take over Amazon.	1.0
And if you hear something that I've got a clue about boxing, it's just numbers isn't it for ya. That's the same as in about another podcast. Yes. I am. I know you talked about new nowhere earlier. There was a report today that if you were to leave walls number one target would be Roberto Martinez for this one Chrissy will be more Sabri limb. Uchi from Nottingham Forest.	1.0
Well Spurs are a bit of a project or name when he took them on you can go in any way. We don't worry about it. No, no stay. Oh, I don't put would have porch. I'm Geoff Emerick. You know, no good evening. So it was a bit cruel towards the end when it with the reports were saying that was good evening Moon. I if not as a good evening hours.	0.0
That was ridiculous. That was he's such a loyal. Yeah, he's attempted to learn the language. You could probably say good evening in five different languages what I want to show you that it was it was very distasteful fresh soon slight managers when they don't try and speak English don't know sorry.	0.0
Try it and then I do that it's like so obvious though.	1.0
He still doing the interview with it. So yeah, so have a bit of decorum because he doesn't have to I can send someone else. So it's one of them. I'm sure I'm sure he's really dead proud of himself that journalists anyway, so she's Jeff. You should be able to run this one off and leave quickly got a question. It was off Andy hit kins. He of course a big follower the academy team but he says with a squad selection today is pretty obviously with the numbers on the bench. Is this show a lack of first-team squad depth	0.0
Pretty obvious in yeah, that's the pin the that was the concern when it going into it small Squad, but new nighlok small squads and if we get any if you've got a few more injuries, not just Bali, we're really struggling at me. I think January maybe we also have this don't me you need to get defender of need to get them a stronger body. But Ruben Diaz has now gone 200 that takes some generous Bend is that their Portuguese clubs are ready to sell them.	0.0
I just want me before Six or seven days absolutely Macedonian got as well, isn't it? That's what they'll go.	1.0
They'll go for top top league players are young still we've got to assume what you said four layers going to go back and he's got to go back. He's got to go back home actually devastated about who's better Tom Cody lovely house that's a letter to a friend not to speak speak the comment sections in trouble now, so I'm really happy to come here comments. All this that's dog song is Right Enochs all this stuff about new no going to ask not and the fact that he didn't make any subs and that he's putting into 23 players on the bench could be right Jeff. I need some money desperately and the the story that came out just after the summer transfer window where it was wolves didn't know where they were going to be in the Europa League. So they were going to invest we know definitely going to be in a plane at least two more games and you would hope for maybe eight more games to get to at least the quarterfinals. So give me another two first-class.	1.0
So if we get release another 60, if you go for that in my last night did that even the last fall and you actually get to the phone?	1.0
You know the council went to watch it on my phone. There's no audio.	0.0
Are you on and if you are an Android Android and Android users for the best video? If there was any positions at you free position while for any position or you guys I'm offering odds on Thompson. I thought yeah, I think we need a wee. Yeah, I agree the fact that we change our nation. Yeah, Pedro Neto is Young. You got potentially to Rory's not good enough. I don't think at the moment to be honest. Just coming straight on as how we call cavallaro back.	1.0
Shantabai, it's not an obligation. That was it.	1.0
Then we cover it with re calling because they've got an option on a character as well as well have my up front. So when I face Yugi can't record it now. He's he's not good enough to Warrant calling back. I disagree. I like that's one thing. I think we should call it your player buffing with the current stay at the school. Now, I would have him yeah long-term he for me.	0.0
We'd have him for half a season and then I'd want to see someone but he could do both as medical plan the wing and he weren't too bad for you like the middle. If you do any when didn't either we just won we just won better cover the cut and cover that will challenge the first thing because all right ice like Cody off right sometimes but he's got nobody really who can challenge him for that position then Duncan maybe could Bennett has played there when Cody hasn't but I mean, he's not gonna pressure code. So it's just that's all I want is comp good competition is good right wing back. We have got any competition right wing left wing open. So we have got an important show me call being and - yeah, did you listen to the mark Kennedy podcast or I've listened to you and I'm sorry for protein and that's right. But yeah, even Eve said that the cleared yet. He said it got to the point where no Challenge and you just couldn't get motivated. He said he was playing Robert. She didn't care. She knew was always going to be honest.	1.0
I think I think I tweeted a couple of weeks ago like we can have a player like I think it was relay home Betty. You can play two games in a row pie really poorly, but it doesn't matter because you'll still be in the team because no one else knocking on door behind you and I think Ben it stays at walls are numbered. I know he's had that injury and something this isn't made hounding him again before we get to the comments, but I genuinely do think that's like benioff in it.	0.0
Not just not cozy that way of It Go,	0.0
Doing well.	1.0
So he's a something whereby when he got he got dropped out the blue than me. Something went right, right. Yeah the episode. Yeah, that's of course if you annoying very Douglas.	0.0
Yeah Douglas attitudes terrible at parallel. But yeah, I do think I do think he's days are numbered the injury hasn't helped but if you look at the shame, he's been a good servant of the last night.	0.0
He's overachieved for us like when we signed him.	1.0
I mean on a free yeah. Well, we just we should be looking at better. I thought we got get one more point.	1.0
They could get a decent fee for him as well and watch how old I was gonna say 5 million how much you should have had that on the soundboard how much let's see what the pink one is.	1.0
I reckon that's how much you like. He is. Well, well, this is I think John will be gone in January as well. And in January 9 January, I reckon he wheels will job is Johnny's awful. Well Norris will come back and John Randall John Rudy.	1.0
I can't believe in the road against Miller in the cop that first goal. Yeah. He said he had a locker and another second.	1.0
He's my Vita wrists exam should come with mango chutney salad.	1.0
I mean because they are fired just right, but that's a good moment for us. But the amount of mistakes he's made over the years like it's been crazy, but I don't be too harsh on him because if he met me for not me out. So yeah, he's Lovely isn't it?	1.0
We're gonna move on to the main part the podcast although it's towards the end. Yeah, we do like you may have seen on one of our videos this week and you may have seen on our Twitter. We're doing it with a plot twist. However, someone did moan about Is to me on Twitter. So we doing it a team of the year was it? However, I can't remember stupid idea whose idea was it. However, you cannot select any players of the current team because it's going to be pretty obvious that the team would decade is going to be full of the current crop. So someone said was not the team of the decade than is it. Well, they're like and then I put the island from Hangar big if we've all the some we fade if we if anyone picks we have do it seemed to dick it decayed dedicated to it.	0.0
Exactly. David was okay. Hurry all start over. You will do by a new weekly planner.	1.0
Wait, this is team Harris team of the decade with no current walls playwright player.	1.0
But what I will say is that you were these picked and on ability there but my love for him. Yeah, that's fine. So in golf colicky me, I'll be right back Kevin Foley when we got promoted this time of the you want. The it that was good. That's enough. Let's not lie in this decade 2009 not 2019 10 years. The deck is 2010 219 stinker. He was the best ride back in that time.	1.0
Joking Foley was amazing.	1.0
A lot of people did Pickens. I'll give ya Tommy you're not wrong, but he wasn't. It's strange to see what people think of decade is because they were picking like Matt Murray and people like someone had Kevin was scattered Steve more exact dude.	0.0
So let's pause there Jody Craddock loads of people have said this he died 16 times in this decade.	0.0
Okay another sure you're off to a good start here.	1.0
I knew I knew you would but it because I said it I don't put it in the teaser is shoe home bathroom, then it's dead.	0.0
But I'll let kradic is okay, because the second after that First Premier League season using men / remember nobody gonna Portsmouth with the bandage on her head laughter we're gonna season that stuff is purely should be goal weight Liverpool's Richard Stearman he served as well as a popular choice League won money Fear the Beard. Yeah left back my action plan when it was a 4-4-2 because that to squeeze some of these More like a for free fluid.	1.0
Okay like that Christmas Tree by Douglas liftback Dart by right-wing Jarvis.	1.0
Okay, not right wing a bit weird is I like deep Midfield. This is gonna be this is gonna be a controversial one. I just love this black. He worked hard right? I guess he's the captain of us were left. In shock. Oh, yeah, it's got to be so I had to squeeze this one in because I had to put him in there. So he's kind of locking the number ten roll tightly. I couldn't lie couldn't lie out this decade. He barely barely plays a plane but I you remember Harry you remember our forest of other product is what you barely played about your front also, like caustic having a kind of a famous style and academic Kevin MacDonald up front because he's my favorite ever walls player Ebanks Blake. Yeah. I thought about putting Ebanks like this best days with and the last piece of shit. Massive tour between tour turns three free players lecture and oil a phobia. In fact chart in know which one to pick problem with Doyle. He works hard work Robert my about so there we go.	1.0
So I recommend we got McCarthy who loved that team that team would go down. Yeah. I like hard workers.	1.0
A lot of hard work is if you work hard you your wish division go on Tom.	1.0
Here's what were yours? Right? Let's see.	1.0
It is genuinely some folks of talk. Some folks here boys. Akemi Hennessey. Akemi ago Douglas life back Sam rickets. Oh good you guys right back as a captain as well. Send to back sends. Yeah. Yeah. Now the next two is a very particular moment because they weren't very good for very long, but Courtney whores and Dominican oil into that 2015 ended 2415. When they first came into the team they were insane how good they were also these two boys and pepper in Greenland.	1.0
Yeah, where am I - out clovers?	1.0
Actually, you know, right she feeling yeah, I totally disagree that but Carol my Midfield 3K Mac. Yeah, Jack Price the Sherlock and what he's calling Sherlock and Moriarty not Moriarty the one day and he said oh what? This place is filled up there and it's it's Dave Edwards. Yeah. Oh you got a daybed was it he played the Whole Decade and no because you don't play Mazzy. I don't want to know because the front three of sacko car. Hasta Cavalier. Oh, no, it's like well, no because it's from this decade who's your Striker with a fluid where all is the changes? I just went for pay Steven Fletcher not like that. No, I didn't like Fletcher. Oh my God, and there was a video.	1.0
Rocky since bully I'm since when I dropped the ball on that since Andy Gray, it's got a lot of episode and yes at the time the best rock we've had since puller.	1.0
That's what I think that's fair of society, but he backed his bed and Fletcher never expects to win the crowd. He did. Yeah. Well really never played in the front just so we can't compare Fletcher technically was superb. I remember we signed Frank nubile awfully begin early shout for you have called and he used to always argue with someone with Frank.	1.0
Clatter what was it called?	1.0
But move on I can't remember but he's a funnier Keek Keek. Ya Sheikh. He was on that a lot him and another place. I print on banter on Baby Davis could be and steam. Anyway move out of the way when I come from Gone lap and go we've gotten Carly came up.	1.0
Hey Full House. Yep, left back Barry Douglas. Yeah. So Center afsar Jody Craddock and Richard Stearman Jody Credit Company.	1.0
Is there an echo in this room? Yeah.	1.0
Go to a decade. It's just can't say right back. I've gone with Ronald Zuber.	1.0
Well, I can shout right she'll be okay.	1.0
Cheers my left wing on it going with this decade. So I do Marlo. I've seen people put him in there were steam rubbish.	0.0
He's crazy, but they do not know you don't know how we played left wing of gone Jarvis.	0.0
Yeah in the middle o is apply everything could probably still do a job for us now with Has Kevin McDonald for your class? He watched her brilliant. You think Kevin MacDonald could play in this County? Yeah, you do a job for us.	1.0
If you brought him in I thought about Joe Allen recently.	1.0
This one was hard for me. It was over. Goody Aura like all Carl Henry.	0.0
What are y'all ready? All right guys, you mentioned and I'm really really nice toast.	1.0
About 20 of those. Yeah, I like witty Aura. So I've already shot from everywhere. He's classes. So I picked call him right because I actually thought was very underrated. Yeah - yeah, and he was he was actually really good in the present. Not the crab. Yeah side to side then right wing just to featuring I've got I've got I've got sacko. Yeah, and then we swap them around your sucker for precise a CO these are apart from this current ERA. He's probably Since we left the premises definitely the best these are my he was amazing what to Centre forwards are Steven Fletcher and silver and events Blake good team. That's day up.	1.0
Yeah, David kept him off. You've got him in there. Yeah. He's on the bench and he grew up in the goal of the night.	1.0
So it's probably my team probably Echoes all of those really probably akemi goal. I mean Hennessey's are fresh out.	1.0
Well, he's the most over at goalkeeper in the world for someone six foot seven. He gets beat from distance of very he cannot jumper you can get bleep reason. I'm gonna kick it. Because he's a goalkeeper.	0.0
That's all probably all for that reason. I'll probably go tasuku Shack. Let's go shopping. You sure he's good. Yeah, he could just bury it but he didn't even catch a cold if you Perry's everything away before Peru. Yeah keeping goal. I go Sam Ricketts right back Mary Douglas. I think the cert for left back as well the center backs. I don't I'd probably go with Danny Bolen Stephen just because the league one thing I was gonna put bear ammonia.	1.0
I nearly said bearers. Well, I think he declined very quickly. I think after the Premier League his Pace was Anonymous was he knows he was the fastest player in ask what they usually a hundred meters from he was faster than Jumbo's well, but you just quickly work quickly love the German suplex on a corner there.	0.0
It's got be again Jarvis and sacko. I think McDonald as well. He was humble. Evil, it was animated Edwards. Yeah, we've got super David want us. I want to say and I'll get slayed. Oh God. Hey dudes, who else it like Jesus?	1.0
Who else is in there for this for this decade? He's been the greatest servant for the club. Yeah to stick with us when he could have easily gone to another championship team in these Waters.	1.0
10 goals in his last season for us some names of central midfielder who had since then that could even rival also barred by the Premier League Lee Evans and your lie ever told shovel Michael Jacobs who was involved in this exercise is only whole light to medium actually.	1.0
Yeah, but then it doesn't make you so happy that what we've got now it does work and how quickly a job because it was just money wasn't it that we couldn't see Morgan as one man by himself if he would have had billions there were had all these records on Isn't it you didn't own all those players, but obviously we couldn't buy them and we got 10p Strikers.	0.0
I'd probably Fletcher in a faux be so sad be back like laughing. Like Tom said I think you just did he did he did play?	1.0
Well in that season we got relegate even had even not broken his leg against you can't really get into Doyle Doyle is the man we met for a career that talk about a career that declares. He Banks play key roles as he was 35 NOS Steve a little bit younger than that.	1.0
And when he recovered he just jumps around all the nails. Oh, it was Telford. It looks a bit. I'd love to he loves the beers. Apparently.	1.0
He just he just parties that season when we got promoted idly. I think I've been to quite a lot of the wagons onion every time I walk to the stadium was only back to back to school today. You just leave that darling.	1.0
Did you hear about the coffee where he said he called him stood?	1.0
Whenever a balloon here, we have mentioned either and he kills not a very good player. But inside is are you ready Freddy? Yeah previously in existence. That's the game.	0.0
That's the real quiz at the at the at the molyneux sleep at is the other thing that's wrong is it allowed to run wolf where they were there? They play indoor thought we would call Henry and no one said RE/MAX break. Who's Carl Henry's there was all this a Eubanks baby comes out every night has eyes in class. He's like, yeah a lot lot obviously burned off always on camera because we never pays they pay you. Yeah, so that's that's the team of the decade.	1.0
We rifle through the worst one I got. Yeah. I've got work really. Well. You do the worse one then ya gonna do it. Do you know you won't take long here? Going how are you go first? Because I've got well, this won't cause an absolute war and I said it before recording Martinez is my worst one. I just thought it was awful you that like Bobby Lonergan hates God phileas Fogg / - right back for layer. I think the guy is awful Miranda Center back. Yeah. I've got him Roger Johnson. I thought after e which started off right then he was absolutely horrendous. I thought maybe West Brom we lost five. I think that's what's more. Yeah. Yeah. Did you hear the 77 Club when he came on a not-so-nice uncle that's yours the old gold. What's a just like call me feel sorry for me, please General Van Dam left-back controversial but comfortable three times and he's got a wife at home. Sick Greg Halford right-wing awful. Can you pronounce that Peter? I'm a younger. Yes. It's prints on the anger and pizza pizza. Just like you said Dave I put him in Just Cause he was all at once you sign the contract. He was awful Jamie O'Hara he as good at the point. I left wing my - burn baby burn laughing. I'm pronouncing Brenda not front, which is Welsh for Hill Leo Bonner Cheney is one of our worst ones.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
I remember when he first signed me my maker speaker Mike Lewis and he was like Eno player. He's awful. We wouldn't say he's going to be real we wouldn't be where we are today without bond. It was like it was awful my offer.	0.0
So, you know know you got you got Granite whole Yonex agbo, and you picked Leo but it's Xena grunts growls grunts like one.	0.0
Yes, I did that quite quick, but they just won't come to my head when I speak about it might seems a bit. It's very similar. The only difference is I've got Cameron ball three Jackson at left-back. All right, man. Where is he now? I mean I didn't exist.	1.0

So me too. We were like, you know what? I'm sure other people struggle with this too. And so let's talk about it.	1.0
Let's bring it out there and well, I'm I'm really guilty of like sharing memes all in like inspirational quotes and things like that on Instagram all the time talking about you anxiety and self-care and you know how you can manage it and sure that sounds nice and fluffy, but not all the time. Can we manage it with memes and coffee? And taking a bubble bath. So right which I mean it all helps but yeah, sometimes sometimes sometimes yeah, we'll see so so I know Audrey and I have spoken obviously beforehand about our previous experiences with anxiety and we have both in in overtime bin both diagnosed with a clinically diagnosed with anxiety. So I thought what we do first is kind of tell our like a briefly tell our story about how the It impacted us and then kind of what we're doing with it now and then maybe talk about some ideas of how we can other than a bubble bath how we can kind of help to relieve some of that anxiety when we're having those stressful days. Yeah, you wanna go first.	1.0
Yeah, I'll go first. So I think anyone who probably knows me since I was a kid knows that Audrey was that anxiety girl the worrier and I grew up in the church and so a big Big part of my upbringing was you know, pray about it and you know, don't worry don't be anxious and have faith and all of that stuff is fantastic and amazing and it is helpful. But sometimes if you have a sinus infection or you have the flu you go get medicine to help you with that or you go see a doctor and so my anxiety kind of got to a point where it was really hard to even function where it was just like okay something is not right here. And so I would say probably probably in college is kind of when I finally was like, all right, this is not this is not normal like normal people don't get this worried to the point of you know, you can't even do new things or you can't function in life. And so I started first seeing a counselor and she was really really helpful. I think one thing about a counselor is they're awesome. But sometimes we kind of view them as like a Next it's like okay, I'm gonna fix it. But just like a car you don't get your oil changed once and then drive the car for 10 more years sure. So I think with anxiety different things in your life can kind of happen and it rears its ugly head. And so I think it's important to kind of know yourself and know what your triggers are and and acknowledge them and then not wait until things get really really bad before you try to get. Because it's just going to be that much harder to dig kind of dig out of it. Yeah, for sure. Yep.	0.0
Awesome. Awesome, but good story.	1.0
Yeah, so glad you have anxiety.	1.0
I know it's a lot but but you know what? It's so common now, it's one of those like, oh, I have anxiety who have anxiety. I have depression. You have depression who like right is it is it you have a mental illness and I really love just that there is such a spotlight on it right now. I mean, I I have always gosh my parents got Divorced when I was we moved here to st. Louis when I was in third grade my parents got divorced when I was in fourth grade and that was a pretty ugly divorce. And so because of that my parents had put me in counseling with my brother. So I was used to that concept and then I went through high school and my dad was diagnosed with ALS and that just whole concept of watching my dad died for 18 years that was a lot but in the middle of that I kind of I was always the kid who had To do all the things I mean the old the oldest so I always felt the need to always be have be perfect and get good grades and Achieve and do all the great things - Sports because I suck at Sports and basically I went to college had a awful breakup with a boyfriend and I just kind of went off the deep end. I was I would say I can't quite remember two years of my life and rightfully so and that's that. My twin just the combination of my dad and that that break up like we were going to get married. It was like a whole thing. Like we were we were there and going I switched schools and like it just all kind of like whoo One Time Hit me and at that point my parents were like, okay, it's time like we need to talk to somebody you need to go see somebody and I started seeing a therapist and a weekly basis and I was diagnosed with anxiety PTSD from my parents divorced. From fourth grade which always seems kind of strange but I guess yeah, they're the experts there and it was recording of my Apple watch was recording that and so I started seeing by somebody and we talked and I we did we I went every week and like they would give me things to work on or things so and I was medicated at that point. I think I was on two different medications and I felt good and I felt like I was starting to like get the tools that Did to like handle my situation and and then kind of calm myself down when I was, you know, feeling overwhelmed and stressed. They actually were able to help me give me extra time for taking tests and things like that at school because I would just get so overwhelmed that I could like put I wouldn't even take the test. I would just sit there and like fries. Yeah, which then made my last two years of college extremely difficult, right? And but then it was one of those really crazy things that I met my husband. Well, it was my seen my super senior year of Cool, super super semester my life physical senior plus like the extra semester and I met Jeff and it was one of those things that like, I don't know if it was just our yin and yang - of our personalities. He was able to just come in and be a really great kind of source of balance and understanding for me and slowly over that first year of us dating. I wean myself off of all of the medication that I had been on now people would be like, oh that's probably not the best idea but for He understood like where I was coming from and he knew my whole background and he was like he was in favor. Whatever I needed to do. Yeah, but he definitely wanted to make sure that one he could be as part of a because he could be in our relationship and so I have not been on medication since then but up until now I have recently started well in the last year or so. I started going back to a therapist just with Hattie going back to school and trying to figure out life and what's next for me in terms. Of the crazy world and just my role as a blogger and an influencer how that's changed. I get a lot of anxiety from just being a blogger. Yeah. So being on Instagram all the time feeling like you always have to be on and feeling exhausting for an extroverted interview. Yes. So exhausted. I'm feeling like you always have to have something fresh and new and that are going to get people excited to see what you're doing that day. That's A lot and then the flip side of that is if you would if you think you post something that's so you think you work so hard you did so great and then it tanks and it's like right. Well, you know, maybe I'm a failure or what's going on and then then there's days where like or I get a comments or I get like a series of things happen. I'm also really bad about like collecting all of my feelings and then exploding. Yeah. So that's also a whole nother conversation for another day, but it's I could basically like have a comment that will trigger me and then I Disappear for like a couple of days and and I just don't want to deal with like the world. But here I am. I've selected a profession that makes me forward facing to the world, but I'm human so it's kind of hard like it's it's a lot. So yeah, so I mean I find it helpful to you go to a therapist now I do so, but I feel like sometimes I find it helpful like we just sometimes we have nothing to talk about and like and those are the days I don't you. I have the same situation you go in and having nothing to talk about and then like some ugly yucky stuff. Just yeah boils up from the bottom and you're like where did that come from? So like did not play in that but here we are.	0.0
Yeah, so and I think you and I are like, I'm the oldest child too and my brothers eight years younger than me. So I was kind of an only child for quite a while to and I also combat it anxiety by doing things and over functioning and that's kind of when I need to get better about realizing this but when I get to the point where I'm like doing all the things and you know, working and working out and planning parties and like doing doing doing doing doing it's like it's only a matter of time before I'm gonna like Crash and Burn and are your are you me?	0.0
This is I know yeah.	1.0
Well, yeah and it's I was trying to explain this to my husband a little bit because he he's German he comes from a very like we don't talk about her feelings kind of family. And so For him anxiety is its he doesn't really understand kind of how it is. And it's like it's almost like you have like a trillion things just coming at you all the time all the time all the time and you have to figure out which ones are like real and which ones are trying to trick you and especially when you throw in like a little bit of like depression your brain is like go go go go go go go, but then the depression is like Buddha can't	0.0
That sounds great because I'm worthless anyways, and I don't have any purpose anyways, and yes, and I think one of the things I learned from going to therapy was that I'm really good at playing at a situation that's occurred. And then I try to like then I replay that story over and over and over in my head of well, why did they say it that way or how did what did I do wrong? And it's always what did I do wrong? And then I'm basically become Steven Spielberg and I've like made all these movies in my head of how they should have gone or could have gone. And I've been like look down. Like I've just spent two hours consumed by a probably that something that's not even real that nobody cares about. Yeah. It's all in your head and it just spins and Spins and Spins and it's like well get out of your head and like go for a walk or something right and I think for me to like I'm	0.0
I'm naturally very like caring and thoughtful and I want to be there for other people and this year has been really hard for my family and a lot of people around my family. We've had unexpected deaths and just sickness and just so many cancer and things where it's like, I wouldn't my dad called and said, you know, Mom has to start treatment. I kind of freaked out for about 30 seconds and then I was like, it's okay. I'm gonna you know, I'm gonna drive heard all the appointments. I'm going to make dinner every time and I'm gonna learn how to crochet and I'm going to make her head Cinema and it was like I was going to fix it by doing doing doing doing and then I kind of went through a phase where I was like crap. I can't fix any of this no matter what you do and I think that's where anxiety gets tricky for people like us it's because it's like you can't fix it. Like when your dad was going through that there's there's nothing you can do and feeling powerless hmm to somebody like us who is very Very successful at fixing things. Yeah, it's it's hard because then you have to just be yeah and being is hard hard so hard.	1.0
It's like I don't I have like two two speeds. I'm like fully on or fully like out of gas. There's just like no like hey Jen's gonna like do a couple of things today and like feel like she's accomplished something. No, it's like Full Throttle or yeah, so well, and I don't know if you feel the same. But like I have so much anxiety for my children or child. So like I come I like pick heading up a school and I'm like, okay, I'm gonna interrogate her. Okay. Well Jeff for lunch, which is the Hoosier. Who'd you bring with like all the things. Did you make a friend today? Are you kind it's like I'm like sitting there all day stressing out as is my child making good choices and it's like real and I know she is because we raised her to like do those types of things are or it's like and it's probably because I've never had lots of great like strong female friends in my life, like I'll They kind of bounce around which is fine. So I always ask Daddy. Like do you have a friend like do you like are you you know, like tell me tell me who you're playing with like do we want to play date? Do we want to get? Yeah, I'm psycho. Like that's just one of the comes down to but I want her to have a little friend so bad which then is interesting because I was that y'all know. I love me in a granny a gram. Yeah, but my Enneagram for said like my Enneagram Force has that I love dogs. So I was like that fun. Yeah the funny when you showed me the other day it said that I love having like One person that I can always go to and I feel like I'm now projecting my Enneagram needs onto my jacket. Yeah, which I've learned in Enneagram our small group that you can't do that. Yeah, your child is not having any a gram yet. But you can't you can't do that diagnose them or us. Yes. Yes. Assuming she's a fork. She's not a for she's definitely more like a one like her. I don't like her dad. Yeah. Oh my goodness. Yeah anywhere totally off topic there. But but yeah, it's hard because it's like I stress about all day. I'm like, okay. All right like it. Am I gonna get a phone call? Am I gonna get like a note home from school? Like what are we doing here? And we were when we were having sensory issues are we like? Is there something truly wrong with her than the did I do something wrong that I raised her wrong. Did I like did I feed her something weird at a wrong time in life where like I've done this to her. Yeah. Whoo. Yeah. This is why I only have one child because you know, I have so much gray hair. It's not even funny. Well right before we started recording.	0.0
I got a call about my son's speech. Meaning and how they're like, well we can see and go through this process and it didn't like you want them to be good kids and you want them to be healthy and but yeah, then what if something is not quite right? How do you fix it? And I think the other thing with anxiety that I've kind of noticed just from other people in my life is I don't know exactly how to say it but like a lot of times people are anxious because they don't have a job. Job, or they don't have money, but you can't like you need resources and you need help but it takes money to have those resources. I know and so like just yesterday. So my sons having a really hard time at drop off still and it's it's a lot and so I contacted this place and they're like, oh we're out of network. It's going to be like three hundred fifty dollars for the screening and you know, so it's like, okay. I'm trying to deal with this thing. I'm trying to You know, I'm trying to do the right things, but I can't spend $500 on a problem that lasts 5 minutes in the morning, you know, so I think that's the other thing that's tricky about mental health is that first of all, you have to want to get help because I don't know how many people I've tried to help and if they don't want to get better sure they can't they're never going to get better. But even people that do want help sometimes it's it's hard financially to to get the help that you need.	0.0
I totally get that and I think for me it's like when I've tried to help people. I've I've helped them while I'm like saying. Yes, you probably need to go talk to somebody. That's great. The other things that I've done is the first thing I've now kind of trained myself to do is when I'm starting to feel funky, which is this is weird. I'm going to say it. Oh I sit in my car and I listen to loud Christian music which yeah in the past.	1.0
And this would not be like anything close to me to like I yeah, like I'd like to try her face. She's like, oh my God, I'm like, oh, yeah.	1.0
Yeah. I've never like I always used to make fun of my mom when we were younger because she used to listen to like, what's the joy of em. Oh, yeah. I don't listen to the radio radio, but I listened to XM radio and so they have a channel called the message. And so which happens that a lot of the music that they play on the message. We actually played our church so it works out but like I just feel like when It's like almost like I'm praying to feel like just I'm trying to release it when I know that it's like I can feel it in my chest. Like I just sing really loud. Which yeah, it's I don't know. It's a whole article it is like the other day. I was listening to Skillet, which if you don't know who Skillet is there like a heavy metal Christian rock band, which you would never know there were heavy metal Christian rock, but you should listen if you'd have time go listen to Stars which is so good. It's like I was for the day I was driving to the mall before a thing that had to go to I'm just like I'm like, okay. Well, that's a fail because I'm like losing my makeup. You're not gonna do all this again. Yeah, but like, I don't know for me singing just like it's almost like it's like releasing from me to like just at least calm down and it's my way of prey like like an open loudmouth prayer of like, okay. I'm here. I just need some help. Yeah. Well, I realized that that that is helpful. I also understand that having a counselor or a doctor or those also like you have to have all of those components I think you yeah. To really make you feel like you can help help it kind of get under control. That's yeah, at least that's what works for me. I've probably become more spiritual and that respect and like in the last probably two years. It's like I would have never thought to like jump right into that be like, yeah. Okay, that's not that's not like I grew up in a church-going family. But like I haven't really like connected to that until like recently which is kind of cool. But yeah makes me feel better.	1.0
So anything kind of what you're saying to you like if you're Having you know a lot of anxiety and you're just not feeling great. I kind of like to say you have to give yourself a fighting chance. So I mean I noticed when I'm eating really poorly and I'm not working out and I'm just like I guess what's one more pint of ice cream and that's me and hurt me and Fountain Coke. Yeah, like you just you just feel like gross and I think I kind of made the decision last week and then of course, I got my wisdom teeth out this week. So I've kind of been knocked down but um, I'm Like you know what? Okay, I I'm probably never going to be the same size. I was before I had kids and that's fine. And but I need to give myself the best chance that I can so I'm going to drink water. I'm going to exercise even if like 30 minutes. And so last year I did an Ironman Triathlon, which released 1.2 miles Swim 56-mile Bike and then a half marathon. So for me to sit here and go. Oh, I'm going to walk for 30 minutes. It's like kind of like a In the face to myself because it's like are you kidding me right now? Like you just did this a tower of n but that's what I can do right now. And so that's what I'm going to do. And those little habits are going to build on top of each other and then you're going to get stronger and grow and yeah, and so I think part of it too is you have to give yourself the best possible shot that you can but that kind of brings up like self-sabotage. I know I do that. I'm so good at that where it's like, you know, I'll do a way. Weight loss challenge or something and I'll get so close, but I'm like, I'm not going to make it so I'm just gonna gain ten pounds anyways, and like why do I do that?	1.0
That was me. So yesterday I had to go I went to go get a chemical peel and the gal that that was there. She's like, oh I saw that you were going to do hard 75 did you do it and I'm like, I don't even try I like. I know I announced it and I was like, I'm gonna do this. I'm like gonna jump it and then what is it? Oh heart 75. Oh, it's awful don't do it, but it was basically two workouts a day. You had the E stick to eat like an eating diet of your choice. You had to read a 10-page to 10 pages of a self-help book a day and no alcohol for 75 days if you missed you had to start over so it's like a hardcore. Yeah, it's hardcore. It's like a yeah, it's super hardcore. So I was like am I like I was I was to the point I was like, okay. I'm in a good place. I think I can do this. I'd like to get kind of myself situated and it was like a gave me enough time that I would be done by Thanksgiving. Well, we're obviously Asleep, we're not there in five minutes.	1.0
You could do ya any five hours.	1.0
Yeah. So Jeff was like he came to me. He's like I saw that you posted this thing. I'm going to just take a step back and be like, I think you've been off more than you can chew and I think you're going to fail. Well, I appreciate my husband telling me like, I don't think this is a good idea then it was like he put the anxiety in my head of like, whoa, I think you're going to fail so like it was yeah, I'm setting myself up to fail, but I'm already being I'm already failing. So yeah, it was like, I think I'm not going to that. So anyway yesterday girls like Did you start at South both 75? I'm like no. No, didn't you enjoy it? She's like, okay. Just checking. I was just like and then she felt bad because like she thought I was like, right I was like no it's not a big deal. I was just it was it was like a like a gut decision that decision in the moment and I'm like, but that like for me and my lifestyle that I don't think that's a good fit, right? Yeah. I mean for me it's my goal is to get up and to go to the gym every day and feel good about you know, if I wake up and I don't feel right or like my Foot doesn't feel right. Like I don't go like I want to I do it feels good for me that day or if I need a rest day. It's great. And then yeah, um, that's what I do on that kind of a thing. Yes words are hard today. Apparently. What else do you do to help with your anxiety though?	1.0
I think. Every time I feel like just crazy crazy anxious, especially at night. It seems like it gets really bad at night. I'll watch an episode of like schitt's Creek or the office or something. That's like just I kind of know what's gonna happen. The characters are comforting to me and afterward it kind of like get your mind off of it and then afterwards it's like, all right, maybe this wasn't so crazy after all I also have the Calm app the daily corium. When I pay you for like the yearly thing or whatever and they have like a daily calm every day that's like 10 minutes and you do this calming thing and they have a bunch of different other like series on there too, like tackling anxiety and means meaningful eating mindful eating and just different things like that that it's so funny because you said like listening to Christian music and it feels very like woo or like just kind of corny or Shay. Yeah, well, you're just like okay, I do a meditation but that stuff really does help and it really makes a difference and I don't think there's anything wrong with doing it. I mean it but yeah, I've totally at first I was like this is so stupid. This is not going to help me but just like anything else if the more you do it the more it's gonna help you.	1.0
Well, I will tell them the story of me joining a second gym because because of that so I go to boot camp gym now. Love it, but for me, I am a burn time a bar lover and I kind of a behind my husband's back this week. And I joined about a local bar studio that Alpha also offers yoga and So currently I can't go see my therapist because she's got some stuff going on and we probably will be back for a month or two. So I'm in my mind. I was like, well, I'm going to try a new form of kind of self helping myself and I'm gonna do Yoga three times a week to see if I can kind of like Get Out of My Head learn how to like take deep breaths and really focus on the important things and just kind of have that me time. That's not not like going to the like another gem. This is like truly like a mind-body connection type of a thing. So report back on it. I'm going to go to my first yoga class next week I'm signed up to do it. So but it's like I think it's those things. It's like what can you do like, you also have to think outside yourself like, okay. Well, I've tried this. This doesn't work. Can I do something else do I think that will help and I so I'm going to try this for a few months and see if we'll see. Yeah, we'll see. I mean it's not going to hurt anything. So if anything it makes me feel stretchy, so right.	1.0
Yeah, and I think one thing you were saying to that or when you were talking that made me think of it is like eye for me like when I'm feeling anxious, I feel like everyone around me knows it. Oh for sure, but I'm really good at hiding it sometimes not necessarily around my kids or my husband. Because you day just kind of always get the worst of you unfortunately because they know you the best but you know, like tally your spouse or tell your kids like I've gotten into the Habit where I'll just tell the least like Haley some really struggling right now. Just give me a minute. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be short with you because I think like just saying it out loud is like this is a real thing. Like if I had a headache I would say hey, I have a headache or I sprained my ankle or whatever. It's like this is a real thing like this is Real condition that I have and you know, it's really flaring up today are probably having a rough day with it and just having somebody to that you can reach out to and sometimes like just laughing about how ridiculous anxiety is because it can get you like the other day Dex came home from school and he just I go are he just doesn't seem like himself. He just seems kind of sad and so are goes. Hey, buddy, so Dax is for okay, he goes hey, buddy. Do you have any pain in your back or your legs or your neck and that's was like I don't think so and here it looks at me and he goes well sometimes kids have cancer, you know, and that's how they find out about it and I was like what the hell if you can't say that to me and then I my brain like when you know, of course like, you know, I have a kid with cancer and how am I gonna deal with this and my mom has cancer but it's like I just had to kind of laugh and just shut it down and be like, nope. We're not gonna yeah. We're not gonna go there. Because it's not doing anything now, sometimes I've heard people what they'll say. Well what if this what if this and then they'll take it all the way? Yeah. Okay. Well, what if that does happen? Hmm. Well, okay. Well what you know and then just kind of played out and I mean even if the worst possible thing for to happen, there are people who they're resilient that you know, we will carry on and so I think it's hard at like it's easy right now to talk about all this because We're not in the middle of like an anxiety storm because with wait till this afternoon is this weekend, right?	0.0
Something will pop up.	0.0
Well just yesterday. I was telling my mom like, oh my gosh. I feel so much better my anxiety and then this morning I texted her and I was like, please erase everything. I just said yesterday because I'm feeling very anxious again. And I think for me to just like getting outside of your head talking to somebody else like just because anxiety story self-focused and just if you can like get outside of Yourself a little bit.	0.0
What was it the lives that last weekend when I text you as like I'm going to quit the internet again today. Yeah, I don't do this anymore. Like I just want to know if you're like what happened? I'm like nothing happened. Yeah good the internet today. Like I just sometimes you're just like you kind of hit like this internal Tipping Point where nothing's really like doing anything but you're like, okay. Well the it's all creeping up again. And like I said the same thing I have I text you when I have a feeling weird and you're like, okay. Well, let me Knock you off the cliff and I'm like, yeah, and I have another good friend that lives in Ohio and I'll text her and I'm just like I don't know what's going on today. And so of course, it's nice to have other people who have the same anxiety situations that you do and so it's nice because like I might have a weird trigger point of like different things, but you also have different different areas that sets you off or I have another fun the same situation, but it's now we've kind of figured out how we can work together to kind of get you back into To a better space for that day, which is nice because then it's like okay. Well one you just saved me 50 bucks. We're going to therapist. Yeah, so it's somebody that truly cares about you and wants the best for you. So so it's like, okay. Are you having a better day now? Can I bring you some coffee?	1.0
Like what's yeah, I think to like just know that it's it's a legitimate real struggle and it's okay like you're not inconveniencing anyone you're not you know, like I think two people are like I'm so sorry. I'm a And it's like that's but that's part of you. That's all of you. You know that the good the bad the not so good and I think like if you can't take me with my the best of me you're at can't take the well, well they say with if you can't have the worst of you can have the best of me kind of right have you got it's all the all makes you part of it, you know, like for us to like some of that achieving that anxiety kind of helps us to achieve more and the you know me like worrying about people and caring that makes me really caring person. So there are aspects of anxiety that are good. I think it's just when it gets out of control and it becomes like a train that just won't stop and you can't make it.	1.0
Yes. Stop grunts. A moral of the story is I would think everybody has some form of anxiety and I think if you were saying no, you're kind of full of baloney because I think any denial Lingus you're doing here in denial is not everywhere in Egypt. Yeah Egypt. Yes. Anyway home and gen Wu I would say yeah, I mean On everybody is affected by it, you know obviously severity is going to change to you're not alone. I think that's the most important thing and three if you need help ask for help, like there are people there that to help you there are there are resources all over the place. I'm sure we could probably pull up a list of yeah, but put a list of resources together. That would be good for no notes who we show notes. We're also going to have some we have some in fact check. Yeah, there's no facts here. This is all just opinion. Actually we should probably	1.0

Yes, but yes, it's I mean, I think it's a good thing to talk about it. And if you ever want to talk more we're always here to go to coffee have conversations, you know, text us. Yes, we we're not like we're not were like we're therapist or anything, but I think we've all been there and we understand it so which is a good thing.	1.0
Yep. Yeah, and I think asking for help is good. Start with your primary care and if they refer you to someone else, that's great, but don't don't feel ashamed and I think be your own Advocate. You know, like if you're taking walks in you're going to yoga and you're eating healthy and you're like really really really trying and it's like nothing is still working. It's okay to get help ya by someone who is professional not us. All right. Do you have a murky motherhood moment this week?	1.0
This week daylight savings has been kicking our butts. So we have had a lot of just morning meltdowns this week of really like we had I don't know if Elise was ever like this but we have had he doesn't like to wear socks because I don't like to wear socks. Yeah, it's a sensory thing, but I also don't like to wear socks and I don't I don't I don't promote socks in the summer and she always wears like natives usually don't wear socks because they're perforated and my mom gets so mad at me because she thinks that their room Her heels anyway off topic there. Um, but it's the other day. She came out with a summer dress on and it was strawberries all over it. She's like I'm wearing this to school and I'm like, well, how do you want? It's like 20 degrees outside. Yeah, we got to wear tights we get tights on her and then it was just like the World War 3 with the seam in the thing in the boot and the we couldn't make it work. So finally like she's like in the living room no clothes on. She's like, I'm not going to school today. This is Aeolus and I'm like, well, you have to go to school one. So then we're trying to be logical. I'm like, well you like to go down the flagpole at school. So if you don't wear tights you have to your legs gonna get really cold on the flagpole. Yeah, and you can get hurt like you could get frostbite or something. So what finally be like agreed to pants and a shirt but it's like whoo buddy, like the sock thing is a challenge for us right now. So today I Center in glit like some glittery looking Ugg boots. What does it we don't have to wear socks because they're furry on the inside. So compromised. Yes, that's good. Gravy, how about you?	0.0

We've all just kind of had that like low-grade just like thickness of like coughing and not snot and just junk and so at least this morning was I did here coughing a lot last night but this morning she comes out and she's like, I don't feel good all she goes I got to lay down before I pass out heard your men like, okay, so it's hard because the other day she goes mom. I do admit sometimes I do lie, and I just don't want to go to school but this time I really don't feel good. Oh, so we're really working on like the telling the truth. Yeah and up to give you a millionaire have book The Lying is it's a challenge because like that's the worst to me like being a liar is like it's awful because no one can trust you.

I love it. I love this. I really do. We've had a few questions from people and a lot of the weird random diems have to do with us and like the most absolutely hammered we've ever been It seems like we give the impression that we're drinking which we are we do. We do give that impression and I just want to say that yes, we enjoyed a drink but like we don't we don't do that every day, and I'm sorry if it comes off that way. No, it's we're working on it. We're working on our no so as we're drinking wine, so no, so basically a lot of them had to do. With stories of us and like the most Hammer we've been together and we were thinking and I said to myself. Well, I mean the most hammered I've ever been just hasn't been with her. Yeah. We kind of came to that conclusion that like we have been very much hammered together college high school, but God well no together. No, I know but you mean other than like being together. I like we're going to tell some stories and one of my stories of the most drunk. I've ever been has been in high school. I started early start him young start him young I really did. Like I had like a lot of things in high school, which mine was in college mines mines pretty wild. Yeah. Yeah. All right. You want to start? I'll start. All right. Okay our love. Okay. So this was when I was 20 years old, so I wasn't 21 yet and I feel like when I turn 21 Unlike just a side note like I tamed down a little bit. That's not like as like yeah. Yeah, you're 21 like drinking song is fun anymore. Yeah, like don't get me wrong. There was no thrill. I mean there was a thrill they're still a threat or so, but this was back when it was like Wild and Woolly. Okay, so I was 20 and it was about three months before I was going to be 21 years old. So a bunch of my friends at that time. We're turning 21. It was junior year. Everybody was like had that calendar out, you know what I mean when like they were had like the 21 countdown. Oh, yeah, three months two months one month. So my friend had a birthday in January and she decided to hold it at this club called story bill and it's in Boston and it's it used to be super fun. I don't really know what it's like now, but I said to myself I'm going to go and it's going to be awesome and we're gonna we're gonna get in there and I had a fake ID at the time and it was a Real a real fake ID if that makes any sense. It was a real human being I had a girl from Suffolk who just like totally hooked me up like she had dark hair and blue eyes and just like she just let me have it. I gave her 50 bucks to get a new license and she just she was awesome. She was the MVP. So I had I had an ID and at the time I was eating a guy who was older so he was over 21 and I said, you know, we I really want to go to this. I want to celebrate her birthday. 'The day he said sure the day of the birth day comes I was I remember I like legitimately like of course went Forever 21 and like found a sexy jumpsuit with like a super crazy v-neck in it and I was like, I'm hungry. Yeah. I was like, I like feeling myself.	1.0
Oh, oh literally and I wish I could do that.	1.0
Don't do it a flat. I can I can roll a tongue do it?	1.0

Okay, bitch. So anywho, so I get my jumpsuit I'm out here like flexing my poor ex-boyfriend of time heat or boyfriend at the time. He was as sick as a dog. So he was like, I'm not drinking tonight you get hammered, do you and of course I'm like, yes, I will we get to a friend's house and her and I take like 12 tequila shots within 30 minutes and I am thrive. Living like literally thriving I'm having so much fun. And so we're like, let's call an Uber. Let's do it. And she's like one more tequila shot. I was like sure so we down it he's looking at me like I have ten heads. He's like this girl cannot drink because I've literally I've known that I'm like, I cannot hold my liquor like, oh, you're a small human. Yeah. So well, I was even smile my God. I was even smaller than like, it was crazy. Like now I'm lightweight. Yeah, so it was so bad. I would have like three glasses of wine and I'm still guy still get hammered after three glasses of wine now, but yeah, so it was it was wild. So like imagine me after 12 tequila shots. I'm out here like twerking and like climbing the walls hanging.	0.0
I'm sorry.	0.0
Also on Tuesday night literally like no longer human just like crawling up and like hanging from the ceiling the rafters, but like literally living my best life. So we're like, let's call now. Uber she lived in Brookline or something. I'm sorry. How old were you I was 20 or 20? Yes 20. So in the my friend, I won't even named her she was 22 so neither 20 as well, not 22 but 20 as well 20 also 20 and she she had a fake but I think it was like a fake fake. I don't remember either way. I don't think I've seen her since then because	0.0
Probably good thing. I remember I don't she wasn't someone I saw all the time.	1.0
Anyways, like it was wicked random. So we again the Uber we're on the way. I remember we were like jamming to like Kanye. He's like new life of Pablo album came out. I was like feeling myself young listening to famous and it was just we are thriving and so then we get there and we wait in line and in line she was like, are you gonna go? When if if I don't get in and vice versa and I was like, well I'm going in like it's her birthday. Yeah, and she was like, you're gonna leave me and I was like, well, I don't know like let's just see if we get in I get in she hasn't. Yeah, he doesn't knock it in I well let's talk to the thing is is my boyfriend went in first because I didn't want him to be involved with like time. Yeah. I didn't want him to be involved and we didn't want to be involved with like The under-21 bullshit right? Because like it's just not cool. And so I was like you go in like get whatever get your coat checked and do you it's the dead of winter. I'm in like a strapless jumpsuit and last time he high heel in Turin is you kind of Wonder I'm isn't though. Like, I don't know. I'm literally walk home. You're like frostbite. You've walked 20 miles and you're just like and you wake up like purple and you don't feel anything like hi. Good morning. Hello. No, so he goes in I go in I turn around she's denied but I'm in okay. So I was and I got in I was like girl didn't I was like, I'm sorry, so she standing out there and I was like, I'll call you an Uber. I had it connected to my Dad's credit card at the time and I was like, I'll call you an Uber and she was like, I don't want an Uber I want to get in and I said well, I don't really know there's nothing I can do so, I don't know how long she stood. Out there, but I went in. It was the year of being a selfless bit like selfish bitch. I just wanted to get him on all you did when you weren't 21. All you wanted to do is get in like you're gonna leave your friends, but it's like hard to even think. I mean, I'm only 20 years but it's so hard to think about when I wasn't 21. Yay. I like don't because you literally had to like fight to get into places or even like pay them. I give them like throw my like, I remember Haley like let me use her. I think it was Haley. Yeah someone let me use their ID one time. Thank God it's it's stressful. Yeah, you got any of like makes it more fun accomplish this massive feat. So like I'm not turning around. Also, I was wasted so like sorry, but then I see a couple of friends from home. I know my friend won't mind if I shut like shout him out his friend. His name is Devon. He he came in he visited he's a Ellie stop eating the bed. All right. We met we need to sell your bed. Yeah, we need to do a lot of things. We need to train her Ellie. Don't lay on the phone. Okay, so she'll lay right here. She'll hang out all that her belly. So then I take photos with him. He was living in San Francisco at the time. He he's a flight attendant for I think United. Yeah United and so, you know, I was just so happy to see him. I was so happy to be with my friends. I was so excited. And I got completely wasted like Beyond life my boyfriend at the time went to the bathroom. He was gone for maybe three minutes. Like I don't really know he could have been gone longer and I just thought he like I don't know what happened. I thought he was gone for hours. He wasn't though and he was like Andrea. I literally just went to the bathroom. It's time to go home. It was like 1:30 in the morning Nicki Minaj was playing. People were twerking. It was just getting wild and people weren't working. I know and I never I never learned how to twerk. Like I'm either I like tried, but which is Barren because I've been like a dancer and cheerleader. I should know how to do that. But I should have Kaylee come on in like give an example or like give up a step by side Kaylee green. She teaches teachers teach you how to twerk. I need that I've other friends I can talk to and I just like can't like, you know what that's actually a lie. I use when twerking was for a school. I definitely get to work and now I'd like got old and I can't anymore. I'm just if I break a hip same so hey, I'll I'll finish my story so real quickly. So Taylor can get onto hers, but we leave we're in an Uber I of course get the spins. I don't really remember why but I was like, I'm gonna fucking puke and so then we get out of the car. We're on Comm Ave for like by bu I get out of the car my ex gets out of the car and he's like bitch. What the fuck and he's horrified Ellie. Does he growl at you know, she was trying to play you were trying to play. It's okay baby, and she and I rip off my seven-inch heels like stilettos like it was not a drill. I pulled him off like they weren't going back on then. There and he the minute he saw my heels coming off. He was like God damn it. She's down for the count like eventually, you know, we call multiple Ubers multiple cabs. They won't let us in because I'm blind different and being probably psychotic and cops show up and they're like, hey, what are you guys doing? And I don't know why this is the first thing my underage self decided to say, but I was like, I'm not	0.0
21 I like screamed it on the top of my lungs to the COS just took time not and they were like can we see an ID? And I was like, I gotta fake fucking ID motherfucker.	0.0
It was so bad and I was just being like so just oh my God, I was literally being the worst human being so tell everyone I would do it was literally like talk about like some salt to the Earth like real awesome.	0.0
Thanks. I could be on	1.0
What's on Cops and it's so luckily. God blessed me that night. Oh no, and the woman was like I have a daughter who is also not 21 and does and reminds me of her to a tee. We're gonna call a cab for you guys, but you're going to go to her house. And and he had to prove out lucky. I know right? It could have been some douche mother. But so I know I got in trouble underage, but we'll get into that. So yeah, I mean they called a cab and I got home and like went to bed and woke up in the morning and this is the real kicker. This is where it gets to be like genuinely like and I didn't drink for weeks because of it because I was just so disgusted with myself. I woke up and my foot is stuck to the sheets of my bed, you know, and that's raunchy and I was like don't roughhouse with her. She gets really viable. We got to be easy without okay Elliot easy easy easy slipping into and I ripped the sheets off of me because I was like, what's wrong? And I was in a legit pool of blood and I had no toenail.	0.0
Bitch, I was like I was like, where did my toenail go?	0.0
And I was horrified like legitimately harm Antonio. Let's just it took literally your for it to grow back. Like this was just the gift that kept on giving Which toenail my big toenail not even just like the pink naughty like mine like it falls off.	0.0
Sometimes that's not normal. Oh behind anyone else? Okay.	1.0
So back in those times when I've ever been there's plenty of other times when I've woke up with eggs on my head and regret and I don't drink Tennessee Honey whiskey either but so many weird memories, but that one that one really, you know Takes the Cake that one seriously Takes the Cake if we don't acknowledge her she'll go back to like licking the Kelly's like being a dean. And yeah, she needs she's trying to company. Okay. So tell your story that was a great story. Um, so I we each have two stories. So yeah, I'll tell mine then you tell your next one and then I'll tell my next one. I'm going to start off with a college story. So I had a couple girlfriends my I think it was like my sophomore year of college and we I want to say it was like st. Patrick's Day or something like that. Maybe it wasn't I could be making that up but we all like got super dressed up like curled our hair like put a bunch of makeup on like how to hot outfit we frickin wore heels like we were doing the damn thing and one of my roommates from college we will call her. I don't know. We will call her Mary that way marriage a week Mary. That wasn't her name. But we're going to call her Mary. So Mary had a friend will call this friend Bethany. So Mary had a friend named Bethany and we saw a couple of my girlfriends and Mary who was my roommate we went to this party. Like it was like this big thing. And so I we got to this party and you're having a great time. You know, we were we were all drunk as fuck living our best life's I would do anything to go back to those days, but maybe not and so Mary's friend Bethany. Are we following along Mary Mary?	0.0
I'm not just kidding me. Mary's friend, Bethany	1.0
Thought I was a different person and me being all dolled up with my makeup my heels my hair like it was curled. My hair was like curled like I was like really doing the thing. So Bethany thought I was some girl that she didn't like Bethenny was drunk as fuck. I like forgive her it's fine. Like she's been arrested like 10 times I Castleton like she no longer. I think she got like expelled from Casselton. It's fine. But so be bad, did he so interested? Um, well, yeah Bethany thought that I was a different girl like and me and Bethany like got along just fine, but she thought I was somebody else and so she poured a whole bottle of wine on my head a party and everybody just look here's Bethany like she'll Bethany. Yes. And so every this bitch pulls all pours a whole bottle of champagne on my head at a party in front of probably Hundred people and I was like, oh, this is an embarrassing or anything. I like go home and cry. But so I look over and she was like, oh my God, like she was probably unlike so many drugs and alcohol the bathroom. Okay. Goodbye. So what was I saying? So, yeah, so she turns around that. She's like like so turn out of her mind that she did say sorry. She was like, oh my God, like she didn't know it was she did not know that that was you whatever whatever she thought that you were somebody else and I was like, I think I was just speechless. I like got home and just showered because I was I had a whole bottle of champagne all over me Meanwhile. My boyfriend was living in a double-wide trailer with Three other men and I basically lived there too. And so I like go back to his place and like shower. Oh my God. It was just it was bad. And I think that was like the same night I could be wrong. But I think that was the same night that girl like got expelled. I have no hard feelings against that either like we're all young and do dumb shit. There's no hard feelings, but I just think that this story till this day is funny as fuck and I'm the one that got a whole bottle of champagne pour it on me and I still think it's funny. So love Bethenny Bethenny Bethenny and Mary. I just know I don't want to say names but Honestly hilarious though. Yeah, their name should be married. Bethany know their names will not be exposed. That's their real names though. Mary and Bethany probably this. So anyway, so yeah, I'm a little bit shorter, but my next one will be good Andrea back to you. All right. I'm going to throw it back to high school. The one that I told you before that I wanted to say. I feel like I'm not going to say it now because it's funny but there's I have a better one. Okay. Yeah, I'm not saying I have like so many stories that I can't even think of one satoko because there's a lot my second see this have some this wasn't the drunkest I've ever been but it was probably the most like ignorant drunk I've ever been in. I was in high school. So it was my junior year of high school. So apparently I just have this thing with Junior years. I just enjoy just junior year is a good time. Yeah. I was like, I'm 16.

I was like a junior. This kid was a senior. He had like a big party for his graduation and everyone was drinking. I wasn't the only one and a lot of I a lot of Vermont parties. I remember being in high school and cops coming to all of our parties. Is that just like a Vermont thing or did that happen to you too? It happened in college, but This happened in high school for us like in the middle of the woods in high school. Like I can only think of one time cops came and I'm trying to think of like what I did like it wasn't it wasn't anything that like wasn't handled like we were outside and they basically were like stop drinking like we have a ghoul can annoy. It was like a noise complaint like a neighbor called and said it was too loud. But like they never checked if anybody was drinking know there was like multiple parties. I got breathalyzed at in high school. Seriously. Yeah, that did not happen to me. I know that was like a thing and people like me that's why I like Hitler. It sounds bad that like not a drinking ticket underage. Whatever whatever but like it was so common. Like it happened to like a handful of people. I know not everybody but I happen to be one of them are just special. I am special help. So how I got the drinking ticket it was A friend's graduation party, he was a senior and he you know graduating high school. He had a big party a bunch of people from different ages went like this is like a pretty big. I remember it being a lot of people there and the cops show up and everybody like this is such a typical like Vermont thing. I know you all can relate like we just like all run in the woods like this was like the thing for Grant away. Oh my God, this was like a thing. Like we all just ran like ran into the woods. We slept into the abyss like and I was just like following somebody but like sis was so drunk. She couldn't like keep up solo me and like my like, I don't even know I was like trying to keep up like trying to hang beer in my hands like running. I'm wrong. I was like I got this I was like I got this And then of course, of course it was like I can't remember who I was with. I think I was like with some guy but we got caught and the cop was like come this way with me and you know, I was always taught that if a cop, you know catches you running you, don't try to fight it you just go along you go with him you apologize and that's what I did. So we went with him was like a group of like five kids and like we were the only girl So yeah, Jesus.	0.0

So I guess there is a good part to the story. Oh my God. Sorry. I'm just looking at my notes and I had a couple different stories and I just looked at this and there was a time where I fell asleep in one of my best friend's driveways in high school. But other than that that was a whole other story, but we're not going to get into that. But yeah, so I'm like crying to this cop and they like clearly tell that I am struggling and so as I know from this point is that I have a drinking ticket and when you go to drinking ticket, I think you need to Like 30 days until they call you because you need to like go to these classes so you can like you like path I be in a yes at 16 years old. No, but listen to what happened, I actually got pretty lucky. So they're supposed to call within 30 days. And if they don't call you, then you're like off the hook. They like forget about you. So that's what happens me. But if they did call me I would have had to do all these classes. I would have had to pay like a huge fine, but they never called me. Oh my god. So let's assume I'm fine. There's bigger and better things to conquer. I know I think I like Even Lee was like people doing heroin. Oh, yeah, and I was just like drunk off of two bears at 16. Like I was fine. Yeah. I feel like in high school like drunkenness was very different than drunkenness in college. Like I got hammered and lost my toenail and didn't remember. Yeah, but for me a school without it happen, I would have seemed very much remembered. Yo, I don't know my high school was pretty like it's funny because I got into a relationship with Cody the my freshman year of College so like I'm not trying to saying this like lame in college because I wasn't like I still want out and shit but in high school like I think like I don't know our fucking high school was pretty wild like I had some of my wildest times in high school, but also in college, so I think it's like pretty definitely I would say training College. Yeah. No, I think I hit it early in high school for sure, but I do think like equally I've had just this crazy times in college then I didn't High School. I had to get my eggs for me in high school was like a thing thing. Like I was smoked I was so against weed for the long. I don't think I had like my first oh my God, my first so bad like blonde or whatever J anything until Earth smoked out of a bowl. So I was in like 11th grade I used to but I got drunk guy in like seventh grade. So I used to go to my car on my lunch break when I was in high school and literally roll a joint and walk in. Oh, yeah our like history and just like Oh, yeah of weed and no one would ever say anything because they were scared my like whole high school did that was so bad.

I knew my total monthly net salary and I knew my expenses whatever I had left was for food entertainment in the inevitable birthday present. Yes. Yeah. I had my money in a credit union where every month they took out a certain amount and it was deposited into what I refer to as my rainy-day fund. Okay, when my yeah, it was a great thing on my car insurance bill came in once a year. It came out of the rainy day fund if I got a medical bill it came out of the rainy day fund saving it's important. Easy, but if you have a little stash of funds when something out of the ordinary occurs get a flat tire or something happens to your car, you know, whatever any little thing you have the money to cover it and it doesn't ruin your monthly budget. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great thing to have for Christmas presents to shopping. Say that again. Where did you go food shopping. I used to go to either the Stop and Shop or Star Market.

Why especially when it comes to fruits and vegetables you think you can eat this stuff? It goes bad very quickly. And if it's very expensive these days unless you know, you're definitely going to be eating it. Don't buy it. You got to have a plan plan your week out. Yeah. The other thing is cleaning supplies are wrong. So they're very expensive. If it's on sale you see, you know, whatever to use vacuum cleaner toilet paper whatever it's on sale and you have the extra money by it if you Don't don't don't do it as far as good meals on a budget if you like chicken in the sauce on sale by enough to freeze it just when you buy it get it break it down put it in the freezer don't want to put it in the fridge because then you end up throwing it away. Hmm. We've all gotten so bad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you can make you know a lot in a Crock-Pot and then you can break, you know, eat it 193 it down into little into the little meals and throw it in the freezer. Yeah, and then you can have it for leftovers. You can bring it for lunch. You can do whatever you want with it.	0.0
All right, let's go thank some good Insight now you ask your next question today. Alright, so the next question. Is what are two things you would tell yourself in your 20 when you are 20 years old and your early 20s.	1.0
So the first thing I would say is take advice from someone whose opinion opinion you value.	1.0
Okay, that's a good one.	1.0
Yeah, don't don't take advice from somebody who just you don't let anybody who doesn't care about you somebody who cares about you and somebody who knows what they're talking about. The other thing I would say is don't sell yourself short. Try new things. Don't be afraid to go for something. Ready for it. Yeah, you'd be amazed at what you can do when you have two most people most people rise to the occasion. And the other thing is don't don't feel bad. If you don't know what you want to do. I had no idea what I wanted to do. So I went to a Julia business school, which that's what most women did in my day. I got my associates degree and I became a legal secretary. Yeah, you know it all worked out fine, but when I look back on it now. Yeah, I wish my parents had pushed me to go to a four-year College. I wished I had become a vet or something along those lines something to do with the animals. But to be honest, it's hard to know what you want to do when you enter college at the age of 18. Yeah, you have any regrets? I do and I regret is that I wished I had gone to a four-year College. I wished I had moved away from my parents home and get that. I think my life would have been totally different. Maybe I would have become a bit. Maybe who knows? Yeah. Sure.	1.0
I think that you wouldn't have had me.	0.0
Well, I would have had a child. It wouldn't have been you. Yeah, I've been somebody else. I would've been better off. All right, um next week that week does that To the next question.	0.0
Yeah, but he which one do you want to pack? We have a few? Um, well, I was gonna never mind. Do you have a number and I was going to say do you have a question that's not on the list? Um, no, I like was going to say something and now I totally forgot but it's fine. I'm sure I'll remember it soon. What's the next one? Let's do number four. Okay. Yeah, this is another one which I think a lot of people our age are feeling right now. I know that I'm fearing does life really get any better or is it a shithole the time? Yeah, is it just increasingly going to get worse because it has been	1.0
Week has been Che well, okay the answer to their question I think is obvious. It's definitely up to you. Whether it's better you look around at your older siblings and your parents and most of you will see that it does get better. Okay, Julia look at them. Yeah. I know. I think I yep. I think the hardest stage to be but definitely the most exciting is your twenties. If you have a good education which both of you do and a good head on your shoulders. Most of the time you will be 20. Yeah the important part of being young and learn From your mistakes. Yeah, listen, because it listen to this sentence. This is very important good judgment comes from experience. And experience well that camp comes from bad judgment. Yes. Say it louder for the people in the back. There's no people in the back row in my bedroom that comes from bad judgment. So every time something happens, that's not good you get to learn from And need to be honest with yourself. Don't blame others for your mistakes. Come clean. Even if it's only with yourself make the changes necessary to succeed and don't be afraid to change direction if you're unhappy.	1.0
P alright, I believe that too. And also I think like you learn from like you can't appreciate the good if you've never been through bad situations Stripes, right?	1.0
That's right. That's 100% Correct. You look around you look at other people and what they're going through and then that's when you realize how lucky you are.	1.0
Yeah, that's true. Yeah, what's that saying about the person who's complaining about having no shoes and then he sees a man with no feet.	1.0
That's right.	1.0
Yeah. Do you know that I don't Yeah, I heard as someone said to me once and I was like you got me. Alright. So the last thing is we want you to talk about your business for a few minutes and tell the audience what you do and where and what inspired you the most.	1.0
Okay, so a needle filter but it is that means that means that I make jewelry and other items from wool roving wool roving is wrong. Whoa. It's right from the Sheep. It's been cleaned car.

I was introduced to needle felting in 2003 by my very close friends foo yung it Potter in the Adirondacks. She had on a beautiful Needle felted necklace that she made is to make me one. She pretty much said no, you can make it yourself. She pulled out some roving showed me how to make a bead and the rest is history. I fell in love with it. I started my own little business.

I've met so many other artists that I've become really close with none of whom I would have met without going to self. They would have been something I wouldn't have been doing shows. I would assume that all these people so it's been really rewarding and I love doing it.	1.0

Okay, just me and you sister actually with Taylor took me to an animal shelter Let's do an animal shelter.	1.0
Have you get to have that the problem with the animal shelters is money. Yeah, I think about that. I would yeah, that's not that's an issue right now. So you ask me one more question. Do you want it or do you want the answer? We're not we don't even really have time we got Nobody, can I steal like you? Oh, okay.	0.0
Well, you know what it is worth it. It's worth it. It's an awesome question. What is it like being a first-time mom and having your first baby yikes.	1.0
I'll go say go cook very quickly. Okay, to be honest with you the scariest part of being a first-time mother is childbirth itself.	0.0
Oh, yeah, that's like my biggest fear in life is childbirth.	0.0
I don't know how you know what I want to have the baby is totally goes away from their mind. That was to come out and find it was already. I came as a rock from the beginning.	0.0
I yeah, I've literally been a shitstorm know I came out and I had a conehead it's okay. I was like Rapture on my arms back.	0.0
So now you have this little person to take care of so pretty much your own wants and needs they go on the back burner and you put everything into this little treasure My Little Treasure is real and that pretty much left for a very long time. Time Karen's put their child's needs first. Yeah, they should and every sneeze and cough from that little person makes you nervous but every smile and every jiggle makes it all worthwhile. Oh you sentimentalize bitch. There's nothing more rewarding than that there really, isn't you could you could be president of the United States, but nothing nothing. To me and I think both parents feel that way is watching your child grow mature. Do things go out on their own. I mean, it's amazing. It really is.	1.0
Yeah, that'll be a fun time in life. But I'm like good for another couple years. Yeah.	1.0
I'm sad I think both of you. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we're gonna get our shit in order open up our animal shelter, then we'll have kids together probably. Yeah or just dogs and cats.	0.0

She is such a soul and I know that like every single person is going to look at this interview and be like another mom saying it's going to get better and everything's going to work out. She's different. She's different like she has been through and the advice of like don't take advice from people that don't that was the best. That was the best thing I've heard because there are so many people in my oh, I'm sure oh my God, there's a lot of people that have input on your life. But but you don't really really like them and really have no idea what you're going through. In your personal life. Yeah, so if they don't know if this is a good quote if they don't know you personally don't take it personal. There. It is. Alright bang. So this is like kind of funny because we just had a like deep discussion and now we're going to talk about sex. So we're all over the place. Yeah. I mean honestly, we just this is a shit storm, but we're doing our best but we these questions are actually kind of amazing and there's also a story that we can share. Yes, that's us Also, it's also just horrifying. All right. So, um, we're not announcing and everybody's in everyone's Anonymous a lot of girlfriends contributed So, yeah, thank you to our girlfriends. Yeah, you guys are awesome. Thanks ladies. So the first question is do colleges actually have sex parties or is that just in the movies? No, at least. I'm not any I know about and I am I probably would not ever want to go to that because that's a little scary. Yeah. No, I mean I've never really heard of that. I've never had the invite. Oh God. Yeah. No, I haven't had an invite. I have heard and sort of maybe seen some weird things but I've never like I think the closest thing to a sex party has been like seeing people in a club like just all touching each other and really having yeah, like literally having sex like, oh my God this greatly. Yeah, so like, okay like that's all but that's not even a sex party. That's all I'm sure. Yeah, I don't really know a little bit more private about my sex life. So saying this is like weird for us to talk about. Yeah, I well I thought it would be we thought it would be funny. So yeah, I think it's hopefully just in movies or if like if you're in a public school Define sex party orgies. Yeah, like I don't really like her but cut in my nose. Yeah. I mean maybe some people do I think if you go I'll ever Arizona or I think it was those big crazy schools. Like we went to Suffolk. I was still in school in Boston. Yeah. I went to school in Vermont and we did not have that experience. No, I think I think that's just in the movies girl. I think that's a little let's all pray together that it's just in the mood. Let's pray. The next question comes from one of my girlfriends and I think that it's just like such an amazing thing so should body count be a topic of discussion in relationship. Oh, I think if somebody asks your body count, they should be prepared to probably not be the happiest because if they're asking their Curious and they're insecure. Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I mean Yeah, or they just want to know so that they have it against you without saying they want to hold it in you know, but I'm also the type of person I'd ask because I don't care I've asked every not that I've dated a bunch of guys because I haven't but everyone I've pretty much been with. Oh I was asked to I've said how like what's your number because I like especially people I've dated because what am I saying? I've had like one serious boyfriend but with Cody I've asked him and I it's nothing I would ever hold against somebody no. I'm not at all unless if your number is outrageous then that's a little questionable but it's definitely something that just is like I'm just curious like it's not that I'm an insecure person. It's just that I just want to know want to hear how naive I am. This is how it this is how bad well this was also a few years ago. I was still in college my old roommate Grace her and I were like in my bedroom and we were talking one day and she goes what's your number and I literally was like nine seven eight eight five three, and I don't know that's not even mine or telephone number. Yeah, and I started saying My telephone number and she was like no. No, she was like you idiot like your body count and I was like, oh I was like, I don't know. I've never thought of it. I don't know why I don't think of it all that much and I think that's probably just because it's not something that's like a game-changer in any of my relationships because I've never really been with someone who's like slept with hundreds of people saying yeah, but that's that and if someone but I'm sorry, but I wouldn't be interested. I would not be interested. Yeah like I'd be like, okay. Well, obviously If it's if it's over, I'm not going to say like what my number is or like what not my number but what like my ideal number and a partner is but if it's over a certain amount then gotta go because like that's sorry. Yeah. I'm like flexible about stuff like that. Like I know that a lot of people our age like sleep around and experiment and do not like different things. Yeah. So that's never bothered me. We have one question or not. Really a question. It's actually a story from one of our girlfriends. And shoot I was looking through. Okay. Here's Tiffany's. Well, that's not even her real name. So I guess it's fine. Oh God is a lot of Tiffany's there's a lot of Tiffany's in this world. Okay, so shout out to this bitch.	1.0
Here's her story.	1.0
Okay, it's the second one. So I was on a date and fell so hard that I was gushing and tore my knee open. We went back to his apartment and cleaned it up and ended up having bomb-ass sex when Queen yes Queen when we turn the light on there was blood everywhere from my embarrassing, right it gets better. I ended up not talking to him much, but I matched with the guy. On tin with his weight sorry much but I matched with this guy on Tinder and turns out it was his roommate and he heard all the sex we had LMAO I oh I have more element feyo. This is a short story. I throw up on a dick once that's a story.	0.0
Okay? Okay. So this girl is obviously seen some shit.	0.0
But I mean, that's there it is a funniest fucking Three I've ever heard when I think of like sex stories. None of that's ever happened to me. No, like that is some like what the fuck happened that night like you're gushing at the knee. I had some what the fuck happened and I wake up and I'm like, oh that was kind of psychotic but like yeah, nothing to the point where I also don't I don't have you ever used Tinder or like any of those apps know I like started dating Cody when that became cool. I've never like an iguana literally never had one. I think when I Freshman College. I made a tender and then like some man he messaged me and of course I'll got it was just so weird and I literally don't think I ever answered. I started dating someone and like never responded and just deleted it. So now I just don't have a tender. Can I also just say I like I'm not against like Tinder and people who online date but personally if I was ever single, I just don't think that's how I would want to meet someone. Yeah hit the bars hit the bars or the dog park. Yeah, you know Not that I've seen any Daddy's at the dog park, but but that's a natural way to need someone. Yeah, and I also think no Enjoy. Maybe the bar isn't always the best option. Yeah do something like a hobby that you enjoy. Yeah. Maybe it's someone's work out. I put see any time about the oh God meeting people know Jenna's where no, I think if you have a dog and you're single go to the dog park go to all the darts on Daddy's there. Yeah for sure. And usually a little off but whatevs. No, I definitely and I can I can say this like I have a boyfriend but there's definitely some handsome young men at the dog park. Oh, yeah sure and I'm sure a lot of them are single looking for a lady and they have don't hit it up who doesn't love a man with the dog half. The reason all my got happier. Okay. I'll say like point three percent of the reason. I love my boyfriend so much is because he's Golden Retriever and I are essentially a relationship. Yeah Cody has little I don't use my man. Dog, but but but it's a different. It's a place like if he had no animals like I don't know only love you a little bit less but not too too much. Oh, yeah, we had this we had this other girl who she wanted to her who this person is. Yeah. We don't know her name. She did like message. Oh, yeah, so she's just trying to she wants to shout out her her ex boyfriend who cheated on her. We don't know who she is, but gee. She's but we appreciate your content. Yeah, we do like a bear up in Lovin her ex-boyfriend had to dress up as a Playboy bunny and go to Hooters and we're all these different things like and she basically said so my cheating in all caps ex-boyfriend lost a super embarrassing bad for Halloween and someone was kind enough to bless me with all these pics. She sent some pretty amazing photos. I mean obviously seeing a man in a tight pink ones. He's always Amazing and then she just said gotta put that baby carrot on blast. So there it is. She's on blast. She won't let us follow her but I truly hope that we pay for her. Yeah, and we wish her the best she jumped the reason I like the reason we were saying this right now is because she just messaged me and it just said cheating loser of the week. Okay what I'm not really sure about these like dicks drawings. Yeah, I don't think that hitting us. Yeah, I mean like they're they're like they're funny. I don't know how old she is. Maybe we can chat later with her. Yeah, if she yeah, she said she wanted to stay private. I don't know. So maybe she's just not even a real person but it's fine fans supporters supporters. Always we love that not appreciate you. Can we do? All right guys? Well, this is getting a little lengthy. It's so lengthy. I hope you guys listen to this whole thing. Yes, I think this is our best one yet. I just get I just burped love that little baby burp. Thank you guys that you guys love you not or nine to fivers. Yes.

Husband Kido is Professor of Economics at the University during Jose in France. He's also a senior fellow of The mises Institute where he holds the 2018 Peterson bloody chair. He's the author of me sees the Last night of liberalism and the ethics of money production as well as many other books and Publications that can be found via his website.	1.0
Welcome to the show Guido has thank you very much. I'm happy to be here.	1.0
It's great to have you on and I think Tim is got a list of questions that he wants to ask you and I don't want to stand in the way of those questions. Let's let's get straight into it. So gido. First of all, have you got a spare couple of days for us?	1.0
Time with us for a couple of minutes.	0.0
Okay. So let's let's kick off we know each other from I think through a mutual friend initially gentleman by the name of Tony deed and in Zurich, we have probably Define behind introducing his personally and it would be fair to say that the Tony is an advocate of the so-called Austrian School. I although I didn't know the Austrian School when I set out in my career. I think I'm a little bit more familiar with it. Now, how would You so sum up the so-called Austrian School of Economics.	1.0
All the oceans go out from from an academic point of view. I would say it's a continuation in modern economics of the realist philosophy philosophical tradition. All right. So in philosophy of this old debate this all disagreement about the question with that any universals and then this is a real dispute that goes back to the Greeks and then in the Middle Ages, so the The idea that the question was whether there are causal connections or concept more generally speaking that apply at all times and places. Okay, and on this ground, so do people believe that this is true. They are called the real risks and the people who believe that there is no such thing that all stood all times in all places, but all things have we can know only related to particular historical conditions of time and place and We'll have to be identified in and again new and all general concepts that we could ever use are just some sort of Temporaries summaries of what we currently know and currently think well, these people are called the nominal this and the positivist and in the 20th century, the the nominalist have hijacked economics, not only economics but you can always in particular and the only guys left standing on. On the realest cam. Well, there might be a few others, but the most important group left standing is the the austrians. So the austrians think that there is such a thing as economic loss. I saw the call who connections that whole to at all times and all places. If you increase the money supply. Well, then the price it will tend to increase at all times and all places. It's not just to today in France or in the UK, but all in all countries and all at all times. So that's the option position. That's really what makes them. Particular and the others so they don't believe this kind of thing and there's a second thing that also came that has complicated things on top of this namely the idea that they are constant quantitative relationships now, that's that's not at all the same thing, but that's what the the most other economists are looking for right there. So they think that in the social field in the economy there is that Loss of any kind in this should be of the quantitative thought such as the law of gravity and so on that we know from from physics, so there should be a Content constant quantitative relationship between different variables that we have trusted in and again, like one example might be the money's stock quantity of money on the one hand and the price I love you on the other all the austrians don't believe that there is such a constant quantitative. Because the money supply is just one among other factors that influences the price level and it does influence the price level only through the subjective values of all people all Market participants. So Market participants that they are videos that doubt with the faculty to choose and they might change their opinions and I changed the values might change from one moment to the other and of course, they're different one from one individual to another so that makes it there can be no such thing as a constant quantitative relationship. The only thing that is constant is indeed that there is a relationship between the money supply and the price level they're positively related but there is no exact quantitative relationship. I'm afraid that was quite a little bit but you ask me I know it's absolutely right.	0.0
I mean, I'm to blame I'm to blame it. What was your personal Journey? How did you get how do you discover the Austrian School yourself?	0.0
I started off as an engineer. So I studied mechanical engineering took some economics classes some some management classes. The idea was to train for Korea and industrial management, but then I fell in love with economics and kind of Economics that I've the first attracted me was mainstream economics. So Keynesian macroeconomics, it's a very appealing intellectual approach is very flattering to young people who just don't know anything but want to world If you have this is right model to tell Co you just got to push on this button and this will happen when if you pull on this level and something else will happen but it's just sorry he drop it just that point.	1.0
I think you've got to the heart of my own skepticism with relation to Keynesian economics. I think Keynes said or wrote around the time that the Great Depression started that we have urged in the management of the great machine. Yes, and I would I'm not an economist but I would argue that the in	0.0
Higher that that is the entire problem with Keynesian economics that the whole metaphor is incorrect because the economy is not a machine the economy is as exactly and that of course, there's cause what back to the enlightenment it's the French and that item and are yes a guy like good immensely and he wrote this book man-machine my you haven't really that all the allotment people that this conviction that really most people will just some sort of rabbits. There. They are. Very few very enlightened people Voltaire said there's something to this effect only one one of two percent probably a rather one percent of human beings are truly human beings all others are just some sort of Rapids and so you can program them as you wish and you just need to fix the loss in this that way. We have a program of social engineering and Keynes was just continue like this you did it with the economics Express. Economic language and the other guys are doing the same thing with mathematical language variety of mathematical models, but the fundamental ideas always the same.	0.0
So we think this is wrong then why does why is it taken? Why isn't anybody else kind of picked up on it and said we'll hang on a minute. Keynesian economics doesn't really work as it should Austrian economics does and of course there are many Austrian economics proponents out there who are trying to fight their corner, but if it It is so obviously correct. Why hasn't the kind of white? What's what I want to get trying to get to is what what's preventing this wider pickup in economics in the universities across the world.	0.0
Well, I mean, I've only not just one one factor that comes here to play. There are several reasons for one for example, is that many people academics in particular just like to play. Yeah. I think it's a very powerful motivation many Meg This like to play with models with numbers.	1.0
So they're just like doing this and you can't do that with Austrian economics. Is that right?	0.0
Well, I mean you could that mean that's a people trying to construct austrians by Automobiles and so on but I mean this is against just play play but I think a more powerful reason why this keeps up for so long. It's just because it suits the people are in power, but why why does it why does this is that?	0.0
As you do you think there's a natural tendency towards inflation as in Keynesian or neo-keynesian economics?	0.0
No, it's the other way around. I think that people in power I interested in spending a lot of money. Yeah. Okay. So they're using they looking for justifications of their own activities. They want to know why is it good what they're doing they want to do anyway see and so why they should text more and why they should they be put into place a monetary. Student that allows for the at-will libitum creation of money and here comes canes and he's not the only one who's one of them and explains them why this is a good thing. So therefore I think they'd hire people of this sword there are constructive. So say if you've got this kind of comments off my back when you apply through you make up a research by for research and and so on and say, okay, so where is this? He's leading us right what kind of policy can we justify with this or help help ameliorate and so on if you say well I probably this doesn't justify anything it if it goes anywhere it probably rather leads to criticizing the whole point of intervening in the first place. Well, then they're no longer interested in finding it because you're not being constructed.	0.0
So this is this is a tricky question. But if you had the power to do whatever you want to Change the economic landscape in terms of how its taught how governments make decisions what would you do?	0.0
Well, I would probably get the government out of it. You kitchen I was just completely out of it all education.	0.0
Yeah, so how would that work? Then? How would it how would schooling the how would I kids to be taught them?	0.0
Well, I mean but with hard work, it's been taught before the 19th century Rhino new government that meant so meddling with with education really started only the 19th century before you had. I thought private Association that the church is in particular would take care of this. So it was not needed that anybody tax tax funded education either either Elementary education middle schools high schools throughout the university and so on it was just being handled anyway, and it's true. So this case great great latitude like greater responsibilities to parents who I'd known all parents will beat their children to high school or addicted to the you to the university and so on. Yeah, I think that that would probably the better situation than we have at present in any case people would have much sound ideas as far as all social political questions are concerned because they would not be systematically biased the system that we have right now. I know exactly how it is in the UK, but I see this year in France. And in Germany is the educational level diminishes every year and we've observed with for the past 40 or 50 years. I mean read the level of Education actually diminishes. So they're doing a very lousy job as far as the quality of education is concerned and if you listen to the education bureaucracy in France, the main concern is not really the level of academic achievement. It's equality. So they want to have student populace that is equal. So we want to prevent it some people get ahead of others and get a head start when it comes to the professional life. And so also they want Everybody to be on the same on the other on the start line at the age of 18 or 19 or whenever they leaving school. That's their main objective is not to teach anybody to help people. They just want to make them equal.	0.0
That's the problem and how would you tackle the economy?	0.0
The economy in general.	1.0
Yes, it's big question. We don't we don't mess around with small issues here on the podcast, but I think people today what not Libertarians, right?	0.0
They would agree that clearly. I mean we have too much of going lately too much of government intervention everywhere. The results are very bad. If you look at it from the point of view of the actual performance of the system to which they to be by academic. Education that economic growth income and wealth distribution as as far as the economy is concerned all these they always screw up right? So you need less of this the problem if you want to turn it back is that it's really it's It's much more difficult than adding a little bit of it to the existing system existing system. So if you have the current system and you have it more government involvement in education, so on a little more that's not a big shake-up for the whole system. It just makes it paralyzed that it a little bit more if you increase taxes a little bit more that's not a big shake-up. So it just makes it marginally more difficult unless you try to turn. Back, we got a problem, especially in the economy. We got a big problem because the economy is so fragile because it is sort of become a Dead junkie but under the influence of monetary interventions in particular. So if you scale back a little bit of this Q fragile eyes and migrate the bankruptcy of certain elements of the economy at this might entail snowboarding effects that have the potential of going on. On all the rest of the economy with that so it's not easy to go. The other direction of I tend to think that as the rule you should think big as you guys are doing apparently because you're raising a big question and you should not be afraid of considering a complete overhaul just cutting a bit from under-20 something like this. I mean certainly the case of money and government spending in the economy. It's on this concert. I think that's definitely a really realistic option.	0.0
Do you think that with the amount of debt now in the in the global Capital monetary system that we're going to end up getting some kind of a reset in the future in a way that may not be as orderly as some might believe	0.0
I'm not sure. I've always thought for a very very long time that actually we have three options right from the current situation. We added also 20 years ago. Either we allow the government is no longer into beings doesn't try to bail out anybody and so on then we get a crisis and then we get actually a deflationary melt all of the whole system. As the first option the second option is you're just trying to inflate your way out of this and of course that's not really a solution but it will just Frank we will just wrecked the economy because you're the sooner or later you're getting very fast into hyperinflation. And the third option is and of very often is neglected. The third option is just to layer more and more regulations of the economy to it's late. But at the same time to eventually sort of Regulation to try to prevent that deflationary policies leads to higher prices leads to Greater redistribution and so on and so you're walking your way into a completely regulated into effect into a totalitarian socialist. And right now I think we're moving on a path of this way of this world now, that's that's a very I'm sorry. It is not very very very positive and in a bright Outlook, but I mean, we definitely need to take this into consideration. I mean, we cannot honestly all of the present situation is very fragile. So we all know so it's very unstable and cannot we cannot remain there. So where will be moving I think they But people who are running monetary policy or running the state the main objective is to stay at the helm a to keep running the country handed over to their friends when they they self themselves as step aside. So they will not consider the deflation or a mountain solution. They want to avoid hyperinflation. So the for them the way to go is more inflation and at the same time Again, I'm a greater control or the economy size. So I was yeah, if you think of something like the plunge protection T to they exist. Yeah, I mean, I mean the central bank doesn't call it the plunge for taxing to you. This is the jargon. Yeah. Yeah, they call it. Of the New York fed write something. That's all they got.	0.0
Do you think they're actually buying stocks though as well?	1.0
Yes. Yes. I know. Okay. Yes, of course I do and that's been evidence of this right?	1.0
We know the Swiss National Bank is done. I don't think so. That's that's not that's a matter of public knowledge.	0.0
Yes in the Swiss because the up from the body, but there were stories already a few years back already. The portal was not American. An American Diplomat broke it but some foreign newspaper and they had gained access to whatever information about the practices of the federal rules of me the way they are doing it is well the Americans may not buy American Stock. I mean by shares very companies, but they might buy shares of foreign companies.	0.0
That the why would they do that?	0.0
Well already it might be just the way to go as a quid quo pro quo, right thanks years of American companies and the Americans of anxious of Swiss company. Right? Right. So this way each of them respects the law and still collectively that circumventing the law.	0.0
So coming back to you your point about deflation, which is something that I was considering to be the most likely initial outcome. Before we get some kind of inflationary bust and perhaps a collab complete collapse in currencies, which would love to get your view on in just a second. But so I can get my head round. How how does a deflationary environment unfold when there is so much QE going on there is so much intervention going on the so much debasement of these currencies and at the same time. I mean we're seeing Currencies and becomes like gold move up. How could these how could this actually mechanically happen?	0.0
Do you think well, I mean what happened if the Central Bank does no longer increase the money supply so its own money. Yeah, right or if it doesn't increase it enough so that people who have been counting on the stronger increases. I left in the cold as we've seen lat. Actually quite with the liquidity issues on new are so if something of this at this can spill over right and that's also the reason why the Central Bank step very vigorously in and prevented that interest rates would rise further and panic would Spread spread and so on so under these circumstances, there's no definition of a meltdown, right? But of course my solving a problem springing from debt with more credits. You do not provide a true solution. Yes problems. Right? I mean, this is something that most people are understood that we are in a very tired are paradoxical situation. They were trying to solve problems bringing from debt with there are more credit. This of course observe because we are just reproducing the problems that we had in the past on a higher level almost exactly as Marx put it in the capitalist system reproduces his own problems on a larger scale because it's not difficult to guess.	0.0
Find the point when the bubble actually burst because we get we it's been blowing bigger and bigger and bigger and people might say well look it's working. Right the stock market is up. It was that we had a crisis in 2007 2008. The market is up interest rates are low, but they're still you know, this there's some very small move down you could make I'd argue that they were at a point where they're meaningless, but but it seems to have inverted. Cam has worked how much longer can this work for before it all goes wrong in your view. Is there can we look at history to find a way to predict how close we are to the end of this?	0.0
Very much is not child that authors hear me. I think it can work for a long time depends on the conditions also depends on how people act what what people will do it can act because we have very smart managers at the top of central banks who know the business, you know, what they can do if they cannot do we have generation of politicians who have enough equal. Reconstruction so that they know where they cannot exaggerate it with helping themselves through the printing press. All right, so there's some minimal discipline there. That's and they want to use really the printing press right now to be in Revenue. We're not at that point. Once you're at that point, then you're close to hyperinflation of closer columns, right? There was for example the situation in Germany after World War one and when they had huge public debt deficits for five years in a row, I mean Really huge and eventually, they just need the printing press to get the revenue because the taxes were no longer sufficient. Now even though President Trump has made some very considerable efforts in that direction of the huge deficit in the US as well. But nowhere near the situation which they would truly do need the printing press right right now they can help sell some of the current market. So as long as these conditions Prevail, I don't think we're anywhere near So drun finish stop stop of the this can last for a longer time, but he can't last indefinitely. Yeah, definitely.	0.0
I don't know definitely is it's difficult to say who came to him saying the long run were all dead. So it's really matter.	0.0
Yeah. Nothing lasts indefinitely. Yeah. It's certainly not something for the next three of five years and I don't think it's something that we could and should expect within the next 10 years or something. But I could be wrong. I mean one thing that creates me because the whole doll system creates problems of its own and the problems themselves might get out of that. It's not sufficient that the current crop of politicians and central banks and so on that they are knowledgeable and that they are relatively discipline. So they don't exaggerate the practice of helping themselves with the printing press because there are other problems that are resulting from the current monetary system that we have. The most important ones being that is the lack of responsibility of the dear responsible ization and of the of the financial markets on the one hand and the the consumption of capital on the other hand. Okay. Let me be the first one is probably this needed that I explain this to you and to your audience because you're probably aware of this right that simply if you know that you have some something like a backstop that comes Through the printing press Yahoo! Central Bank behind you or the Central Bank the sues the mission of stabilizing the financial Market well, and it does so with the printing press then this amounts to a socialization of a part of your risk. So as a consequence risk taking as rule is always on. All right, so you get very from oil you valuation of shares and other asset classes and so on and you get equally enthusiastic use of Leverage. I had to do to get the results that you need at least in the short time. I saw the economy is moving on a on a did path. Right and this makes the whole thing very fragile and it's like some sort of apology. So we are with this connection. I believe this is quite obvious. The other problem that I mentioned is capital consumption all that that's less less obvious. Probably and what I have here in mind is that thanks to the printing press you no longer. You destroy a part of the incentives that push people to say, of course, you reduce the intent of to become self-reliant. It's only good food. I've been so on especially you reduce the incentive to save as a consequence. You are diminishing the capital base right now in real terms of the economy. Now the question is how strong is this effect? If you look at the official figures you might think well, it cannot be that strong because we still have increased of capital. Vested in real terms. I looked at the figures as found its true. So this is this is the impression that you get but then of course you also know that governments try to manipulate the figures themselves. And especially in this case the price inflation rate review. You are probably aware of the work of John Williams Shadows dance dados dad's right? So I've been following this for 15 years ago fascinating when I saw this, Because what he's doing is just providing estimates right is no because you don't have the raw data. He's just out of his own experiences just estimating the deviation between the calculated inflation rates with the current methodology and the inflation price inflation rate. That would be calculated with the prevailing methods in the 1980s. So he comes up with differentials of about 7% I think right right now right seven seven nine percent. Sometimes this is Its enormous it's just mind-boggling. So I read through macro economic statistics information about Capital Investments. And so on in the light of his figures and my conclusion was that if you if Williams in is right, then we have been consuming Capital concept is since the mid-1980s something like this and even if he is not entirely right, but it's only half right there probably will be consuming capital for the past 20 years in	0.0
The defense of the FED though, if you take information and strip out inflation, the inflation X inflation rate is remarkably static over time. I got in case you're interested. I got that off at a satirical u.s. Website called long or short Capital. Well, I thought it was rather good the inflation X inflation rate. Will you you knew you were being set up for something as soon as Tim said to be fair to the the FED? It's like there's two it wasn't so right.	0.0
And that is of course that creates a big problem not for the people who are working close to the printing press so people working on financial markets people working in the government and so on but it's a problem for the economy as a whole especially for the weaker parts of the economy, right Working Class People people jobs very much removed from financial markets from the banking industry and so on and we should expect their you should be to observe not in pain. Parchment then indeed.	0.0
I think there are many indicators that show that you think that's you think that's been a factor in the the trends that have become manifest through in the UK context breaks it in in the u.s. Context the election of Donald Trump the fact that you have a nun saying economic underclass that's basically got nowhere over the last 20 to 30 years and he's just frankly feeling pissed off about it.	0.0
Yeah, and I mean I see I've just just personally that's what my father-in-law's who is this is a working class person. So it's just been work out all of his life and he has been able to in France in the 1970s. He is called a how's it going with his family to application? I mean they've been always very disciplined and so on but he could afford all these things could send their children to school could send them to diverse universe. He was paying for all of this. I mean how many Working Class People can do this today? It's just I mean you to be top notch in your activity extremely well paid is a working class object group occupation order to do this. So most people cannot and he was kind of average at the time. So I think if you look at these things even on an anecdotal basis and see what's what are the living conditions real terms. I would how did people live what did they consume? What kind of food they bring on the table? Where did they travel and so on in light of this? I mean clearly they are many signs of impoverishment and on top of this comes of course, I mean we have both right. I think we have Capital destruction. So there is an aggregate impoverishment at the same time. We have this redistribution. So they're out of the fewer resources in comparison to whatever 20 30 years ago. It's a greater chant goes to their people are very well connected and So the other classes and that is of course, that's that's explosive for society.	0.0
We mentioned that the varying degrees of wealth within a society if we look at let's say a selection of different countries. How sustainable do you think the the euro currency system is given that you've got clearly delineations of wealth between the core and the periphery and that's manifest in the in youth unemployment.	0.0
Wait, well, the funny thing is in the periphery you have I mean everywhere you have the same type of problem Google department and greater region inequality. Right? But in the periphery these problems are stronger, especially the redistribution problem at the if you look at people initially the upper class in Italy. There is a greater difference between them and the lower classes in in Germany. Hmm. Or in Spain or Portugal and so on so probably all right. The problems should explode in the periphery and there's an exploding for free as you know that Greece Spain is very particular. I'm very iterative of Spain right there all the way through this crisis. There is a lot of coverage but then the society it's definitely not something they literally went through things that the Greeks for instance did not would not tolerate the silent could say the same for our the Irish.	0.0
Wrong the Irish have been quite stoic by comparison.	0.0
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So that is a lot of Social Capital emotional Capital moral capital is still there, but you can destroy and consume this kind of capital as well. Right? So we're working our way is one layer of yeah, I think the evidence is strong. It's not conclusive. I think this the evidence is strong that has been Capital consumption as compared to 20 or 30 years ago. And then there are other forms of capital Social Capital ball Capital emotional Capital which all cultural Achievements have been a lot of the way are the basis of our current economic and social order. And of course, we are destroying the winning at them as well. And that's where I see the two problems in the long run another. I mean, I'm an economist so professionally, of course, I'm I'm interested in material things as you are as well because you are working in the financial markets, but I'm much more concerned in the long run about the destruction of the moral foundations.	0.0
Our society's given the situation that you described is not going to change anytime soon. How do you think this is going to play out in the Eurozone going forward? How will it be resolved breakup of the Euro and if so, which country do you think would leave first?	0.0
Well, I think you see it in the case of Greece right when the socialist government came to power the wake of 2009 to to positive the 10 2010 to the left actually, so they got elected because they promised to get wreath out of the Eurozone. Yeah, okay, and they did this they got elected but they didn't take grease all over Europe politicians lying. Well surprise surprise, but I think they were honest when they were running to be elected and then actually they did a lot of learning and they Folly considered what their options were. And the truth is grease dropping out of the Eurozone would have suffered an enormous door back in really comes. Okay, this is this is there's no comparison. I don't say it wouldn't have been good for the country at the long run. Yes. I do believe it would have been good for the country in the long run. Especially if you're no longer on the monetary Lifeline right on the heart-lung machine then well, actually your own economy starts developing organic. Actually production becomes more important than just spending spending money, especially spending other people's money. So that's certainly a good thing but that they would not have survived this politically and actually most of the voters probably would not have liked it. Anyway speaking of Greece right Aristotle once said that actually most people were born to be slave simply people actually most people they they they they don't mind but other people are telling them what they should do and how they should So on as long as they have a nice cozy house and a car and they have enough to eat and saw that they had basically these Aristotle it said that the unexamined life is not worth living. Yeah. Well, I mean for him. Yes, of course that that was the only life worthy of man. Yeah, and as as a rational being so what is our objective as a rational being its he would say well to contemplate those things that they are terminal. But that is not the opinion of most people so I think coming back on the Eurozone their fight. I think even though the problems are greater than the periphery. The cost of moving away from the Eurozone are also greatest in the periphery Germany could remodel The Zone it would be hard but Germany would get along I think actually would be a great relief for Germany because right now contrary to what politicians in Germany always profess maybe that Germany's greatest beneficiary of the Eurozone. I think we actually the guys are funding this writing in real terms because all we what we exporting are real goods and services and what we are getting Hey, what's up promises?	0.0
But what I'm saying what you're saying in these peripheral countries is that the political situations are changing because it's clearly not working. Otherwise, you wouldn't have got a Greek government elected on the basis of leaving the Euro same room same in Italy. So I take your point that it would be bad if people left but it's got to be pretty bad if they're campaigning for governments to actually get them out. So This that's not going to get any better really. It's can only I can only see it getting worse and these differentials becoming bigger.	0.0
Yes, of course the problems that will accelerate but you'll see that what it boils down to its the following right? I mean industry and eventually any sort of productive activity that is not related to tourism. So welcoming British Dutch Austrian and German tourists will just wither away. That's what it boils down to. So these countries then if they stay in the Eurozone, they will have this kind of Fate. It's the writing on the wall.	0.0
But if they if they leave and they go back to a new currency say the new drachma or whatever. It might be. There's no provision for that. Ultimately. We know they just create a new currency. Then that currency presumably would begin its life extremely weak. And that would that would have happened. If I sit in a similar way to the Asian financial crisis the late 90s where The currencies were pegged to the u.s. Dollar but not actually formed as part of a union as we Euro. So what we saw there is a model was the economy's did badly and that caused the pegs to go and then we saw this period of a complete collapse in the currency which made it unbelievably valuable to go and invest in country in companies there and and to visit of course you could stories of Tenten Pounds in Thailand, but it lasted you'd like for two weeks and then then it all settles down and it all recovers and look at Asia now, it's a Powerhouse. Yeah. So this is I'm not saying I'm not saying that we should go to back stick with you.	0.0
Yeah, that's the way to go. That's the way to do it. But yeah, that's not the situation that we have today in the peripheral countries of the Eurozone the situation that we have there is that people are being used to being subsidized out of play. Chuckles yeah, the political leadership of those countries. They I mean in Asia 1997 your Thailand Indonesia. So on the leadership of those countries are no places elsewhere to go. They were stuck with their God their own country. Yeah. Okay, so they were dependent on getting the country back on the rails, but now the political Elites in Portugal and Spain Greece anywhere. Have you brought this lava and Slovakia Romania and so on I mean there Korea's a lot within their own countries and within the operators of the European Union, so they want to go to vassals. They want to have jobs that are created by the European Union lavishly funded so paid under with the same Revenue relation has similar jobs in Germany and so on but then in their own countries, so that's what they want. Their loyalty are not their own country. They are increasingly to this international organization.	0.0
Is that why you think do you think what do you think? Get the breakfast process from your perspective. Do you think that's why it's been so difficult to put it into effect. Yeah, I mean clearly sorry.	0.0
The Elites in all our countries. Well, they have grown together much faster much earlier than the rest of the population. And so therefore for them is already a reality that should never go away and they would like like to keep it this way.	0.0
So I understand this understand this is it is it is it German person working in France? What do you think? What do you think of the Bridget? Process to the extent that you think will ever leave.	1.0
I'll tell you something funny the day when breaks it was voted by. So I was in a I was in Paris for because the French army had hired me as a as a member of a recruiting committee for future officers detail. Okay, so the so the morning after the brexit vote I come to the breakfast room. So there's this General and he is happy and I am happy. We're both happy that ranks. It has been voted. He is happy because the Brits are out because it would like the Brits and I'm happy because I'm I'm happy for the Brits because for me this is the right way the right way to go. It's good to be independent. It's good to be a responsible and I was also happy for the European continent because it will force the European continent so that the Eurozone a lot of European union and general to be a much. Much more responsibly. So competition is always good these things.	1.0
We had a we had a UK economist John her non-pro be a year ago now and he says this DC this isn't as funny now as it was then and he said his perennial nightmare. Is it in 10 years time? We'll still be negotiating to leave and everyone else already gone.	0.0
Yeah. I know it's really painful to see this must be starting to British friends yesterday and said, oh, yeah. With you so sorry. I mean we are the clowns of the world right now. Running joke and say well, I mean I have great sympathy with with me. I mean I come from Germany. Watch. What do you want me to say?	0.0
It reminds me of a phrase. I heard during the first.com boom. So I ran 99 or 2000 which is the Pioneers get the arrows and the settlers get the land. So in this in this context Britain's actually being a bit of a Pioneer.	1.0
Yeah, it's really I mean the kids are all smaller countries where there was much easier. To control the political process. It's much more difficult for somebody from outside to do this input. Right? So but now it's there the result is there and I think I still think brexit will happen. It's just not the same time. They won't properly you need to have another general election in just rode all the resistors out of the out of Parliament and then you you will get it but you will get there and it's a good thing moving to Gold.	0.0
What's your what's your I'm guessing your view on gold is you think it's something that should be own because of the basement of currencies, but but I'd like to like to hear what you think of it at this point in time.	1.0
Well, I mean I started thinking about gold from one entry point of view and of course gold would be much better money then feared money that we use today, but I've come to the conclusion that as many other people before the gold is not actually the best man at their Probably something the best money would be something like silver. So I think precious metals probably the best choice. So I'm not a Bitcoin Advocate and so on and like experiments like Bitcoin because they're free market experiences is a great deal of thinking that goes into this great creativity and what I like about it as a professor is that it gets people to think about economic mechanisms or the economic Concepts and so on. So this is all great about Bitcoin, but still don't think that Bitcoin will be good money. So I think the traditional monies that we had in the past gold silver still the best one. Sorry.	0.0
Sorry, sorry to drop to use it. So as a non Economist, I'm I'm thinking that the the classical definition of a money or characteristics of money is it's a unit of account and medium of exchange and a store of value when you say Bitcoin isn't necessarily going to be a good money which if any or all of those you referring to because I'm assuming I'm assuming you're coming from the store of value. Purchasing power perspective, but I may be wrong.	0.0
For me, the the unit of account of function is the derived one. So you have these three function that you find the text books rather three main functions are sort of value unit of account and medium of exchange. Okay, and the essential function of one is to serve as a medium of exchange so much that that's my point of view. Right? So we have this is the essence of money to are generally used medium of exchange but with that but without coercion Well, I mean the whole stew even for those monies that are being imposed right in one way or another right? So it's the generally used medium of exchange and then as a consequence you calculate in terms of that money unless they're very strong inflation or something like this, right then you need to calculate other different places, but the foundations, of course indeed to serve as a store of value and here indeed we have problems with Bitcoin because Bitcoin only serves as we evolve. Exchange or is a store of value for services right now. It's a speculative object and so on but it has no other function whereas precious metals have multiple. Alternative uses not only in jewelry. But yeah, very numerous industrial uses because of the particular very special physical characteristics of these Metals. So that means that in the case of all it's only always have a fallback position and there's always an additional demand industrial demand or non-monetary demand that serves as a buffer to salvage the these Metals if ever the monitor uses put into question. So on bitcoin is much more fragile about that because it has no natural non-monetary use. So I think Bitcoins have come into circulation and can be kept there thanks to the ideological now and not in the negative sense right would just say libertarian talking exactly. Do you need to have people as the commitment who are ready to absorb the losses that come with a fall in the value of Bitcoins some if everybody just cells Because the price is going down. Well Bitcoins will be driven completely out of the market. So for this not to help you need to have people who are committed to bitcoin. So you don't consider it merely as a monitor your financial instrument now in the case of gold and silver you don't need this you because gold and silver have always other users and people who are active in jewelry or who use: silver cellphones or Aerospace. And however, they will be happy if prices go down and so you don't need that sort of emotional intellectual commitment to this. So therefore they are more robust Bitcoins.	1.0
That's my point to reinforce that point someone who's just had the catalytic converter stolen from my car because of the the epidemic of thefts that are going on at the moment. Yeah. It's this is a big problem apparently in well, I was a big bump. It's been frozen for me, but it's burnt. It's been a big problem. It's there's an epidemic going on Catholics to convert.	0.0
Yes.	1.0
So I think this is this could be a conspiracy to drive us towards electric cars. But but in any case it's happening, so you're absolutely right, but I was very interested in you are getting a sedan chair carried by greater tunberg. That's just me. Me but I was interested in your comment that you said you think silver is possibly better than gold with regard to and why is that the purchasing power of God is always been so high for a whole year.	1.0
They that it could only be used for very large scale transactions. I mean starting with the men's suit may be okay, but then buying things like Vehicles buildings That's also a rather large objects. It is never been really a medium of exchange and daily transactions daily transaction was always silver or some alloy of silver or some or bronze or something like this or this storm. Okay, and that's actually a good thing. It's good that people actually own personally control. The money of the country lutely for mises is we talked about the ocean school before and these economies that I admire most is the end of his career. It was precisely this consideration that you stressed a lot. I said, well, you know sound monetary system. It's the people themselves each all individual Market participants who personally control a part of the money supply and so they only had the money in their pockets or at home and so on. So that's truly Democratic populist control of this crucial social institutions and silver allows that if you impose gold on On the economy and that is exactly what has happened in the last quarter of the 19th century. Like when silver was demonetized was a political movement top down movement and gold was imposed as a money on the the economy. Then you automatically get a shot in the arm of thinking because you cannot use Golden daily transactions that it's you need to have some money substitutes that can take the place of gold but in smaller denominations in Daily exchanges So that's why banking has become so strong and has developed. So strongly in the last Decades of the 19th century. Then of course all through the 20th century now, let me close this in and get to the gold treasure gold. So I start thinking about gold as a monetary instrument, but I've come to the conclusion that God is actually very important in a free society and a free economy as a store. value is eat as a natural way of saving for especially for people who don't know the first thing about financial markets and financial techniques that risk management and what have you very straightforward and simple way to save some of your Revenue to put some money aside for your old age and so on it's just too to stock gold coins and that's what people have been doing for many centuries and I think the reason why central banks are so adamant in controlling the gold price and preventing that the gold price in a foreseeable way it goes up which would happen in an actual free market is that precisely goal is the main competitor not necessarily as money for Fiat money, but it's the natural. For financial markets.	1.0
Could you just back? I mean obviously when we couldn't go to a situation where we're holding gold coins and paying for things with gold and silver the physical mental again. I guess that's never going to happen, but we could have money that's backed by gold or silver and therefore it we could make small transactions because it's just a denomination of of a percentage of a gold bar. So in other words when Bitcoin first started out it was Worth mere sense. It was just a tiny value. Now, you have to trade a very fraction of a Bitcoin in order to for it to mean anything in in real money. You can't send somebody one Bitcoin has to but it's true.	0.0
This would be very very simple to do it. Right? I mean, yeah, that's not difficult at all. And we have already all the elements in place right now. Like you have several institutions that offer gold-backed accounts. So I can so you could have a gold standard of this sort of very easily.	1.0
Is there a danger that if one country decided to adopt this back in their currency with gold but they would not be able to expand their I mean, it's a slippery slope this question, but it will get what they they could then be tempted to undo this if they started to underperform on the global stage in other words if everybody else. Is debating their currencies and moving forward and you're trying to do the right thing yet? You're struggling. This would be a very difficult situation to almost be untenable.	0.0
Well, I mean the difficulty I don't see the difficulty there. That's not come from the fact that the others would be performing better by the Blazing their own currencies, but what they do is just to redistribute existing resources. Thibault, the politically well connected to the detriment of the others the problem I think for for this is ordinarily right for a country that has a sound o better money that other countries right now we've been doing for 10 years now, we've made great efforts to make sure that Swiss franc the British pound Euro and the American dollar becoming more is the same thing as really very few changes. No many just options that we exchange rates and so on but let's say if you have known and foreseeable differences the quality of money to different country. So one country is more inflationary the other is that this stationary What happens is that promotes? Exports on those countries that have a worse money because the residents of those countries. Well, they want to reduce Autumn minimize their Holdings of their own inflationary money as much as possible, right so they want to get hold of a better money. This is what you see in all countries that are so dollar rise rise the phenomena of polarization. All of these countries have export surpluses and the strings from the fact that they need to pay for the dollars that they really want to own. They don't want to all their own. Local pocket money they want to own as our bodies such as the last so long since nobody's giving the colors they need to buy them. So they export so they have a structural export Surplus and therefore countries with the better money than structural import circles. All right. So the the industry is those countries are suffering under foreign competition precisely because foreigners want to get some of the local Honey, that's the reason why the US for example as structural import deficit because many more even though the dollar might be quite lousy as a money, especially as compared to Gold. It's still better than most of the other monies that are around in the world. So people want to buy buy dollars and there are therefore they need to export services to get those those dollars from the US and therefore soup President Trump's policies that try to reverse this trend just with Exponent important controls with tariffs and so on will not succeed. Simply for this reason you see so the difficulty of such a country is not that the police use of work would not workers not before the country. It's that it creates pressure on the local producers. And so you get political resistance from that definitely that's that's brilliant.	1.0
Just one final question before we go to Media pigs. If there was when you're talking about Fair currencies, you're looking at the selection of the the least worst options compared to Gold. What is the least worst currency that you can see? Would it be the Swiss franc? Would it be the Japanese Yen who've given that Japan has just come out of a deflationary. Situational tamizh dong what? What? What what? I'm serious. What what what is there is there any currencies so if we if we put gold and silver at the top of your shopping list. What what what appears below it?	1.0
Yeah, probably this was Frank. This was founded the main advantage of this fact is that Switzerland so small? That's a it's a such a small. It's not even an exit door. Right? It's it's a it's a rabbit hole. Not many people get through this. All right, so Swiss franc is booty best and the problem with this Swiss is a leech bite because the Swiss this still appreciate stable money that appreciates strong money. It's just some of those sweets and industrialists. They don't like it because they see the increased pressure on that on the on the export business. The Swiss themselves. They like in Japan is different stories. Japan has the advantage so much bigger countries. So it's a much bigger economy. But the Japanese if I understand this correctly, I don't know Japanese mentality at all. But from what I see portrait you and always the media is that they are adamant desperate to create inflation. That's definitely not the case with Japan. Excuse me with was Switzerland. Therefore I would say because the it's a more sane intellectual environment moral environment.	1.0
Apparently the Swiss franc seems to be better the Swiss doing what the Germans would have done had they not join the the Year. Yes. Yeah. That's the last Bastion of protecting your currency and doing the right thing not going after inflation at all costs. Absolutely. That's absolutely fascinating. Goodbye. Thank you so much for your time. I know we're probably overrun on the amount of time. It was going to be just before we go. We'd love to get a media pick from you.	1.0
Okay? Let me yeah, okay, I can give you what one thing that I read recently. Okay, so many things that I like but as seen at the very beginning we talked about philosophy and sorry some of the servants rather suits but this is really great and it's accessible for everybody. So I have this I discovered this Austrian friends of mine this psychiatrist by the name of Victor, Frankl Viktor Frankl Man suit	1.0
Demeaning.	0.0
Yes. So, you know you are cultivated person.	1.0
I'm not I don't know.	0.0
I asked him about it because Viktor Frankl, it's great.	1.0
He's a great philosophy of it's difficult reading the first half of the book.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
Oh my God. I'm worried. If Tim says it's difficult.	0.0
Yes. This is an international bestseller is where he relates his experience in German concentration.	1.0
Scoffs. Yeah. Okay.	0.0
This is the one because it's not that difficult.	1.0
It's I mean, I mean emotionally difficulty doing quite harrowing to right.	0.0
Yes it is. It's true. But then so once you're through this and the last quarter of the book, then he presents over this intellectual digest out of this right what came out of this and it's really a very positive life-affirming surprising. astonishing comforting comforting View and philosophy is all you on the other problem problem of suffering and what I love most is this ways that while we need to think of the meaning of life in the copernican turn like we need to think the way we are thinking about this because the way Buddhist would think of it and many other people is well with you need to look inside right and goes look for the meaning of life in Our own soul the belly or wherever and then try to realize yourself right go out and then transform the world according to the meaning that you find in yourself and he says it's exactly the other way around you need to look at the world around you and see what challenges it poses to you. And that's where you will find the meaning. That's where you find. The the starting point for Meaningful life is just astonishing it's great.	1.0
That's so interesting. Remind him I'll go segue into my one. I saw the limited Netflix documentary series about Bill Gates and I have to say it's absolutely I thought decoding in fact the inside the brain and Bill Gates decoding the brain of Britain. Yeah inside the brain of Bill Gates and it's absolutely fascinating what he's been doing. I mean if you if you imagine yourself with, you know hundred billion and you think well, what am I going to do? You know, he's left my	1.0
Microsoft is not running anymore.	0.0
What do you do and it's actually what he's been doing. He's looked at the world. And for example, he he said right there are children dying in Africa because they can't get clean water. I'm going to solve this problem and he writes to the universities in America gets the greatest Minds together funds a few projects which are completely crazy and last week we had on the podcast a guy called Alan Steel who recommended a book called Loom shots, which is about crazy ideas that can change the world and this all ties in with what exactly what he was doing at what he's doing and and he solved the problem. He's created this sanitation system that is just completely revolutionary and I don't want to spoil it for you for other people are going to watch it, but it's exactly what you just said. He's gone out there. He's looked at problems and he said right I'm going to use my money. I'm going to use my brain and I'm going to fix it and It's changed my opinion of him completely. I've heard a lot of respect for him now, but that this book also I think is is is going to be one that I'm going to read because it's it sounds like it's saying the same thing so Tim, what do you have? Well first you have to endure sceeto's selection because Man's Search for meaning is the most inspiring book I've ever read and it's extremely extremely affecting in every sense of the word. So to go from the sublime to the Nicholas I'm gonna go for well, I'm here too because there's a connection between them. The first is Bohemian Rhapsody. And so I saw recently always sort of thought. Yeah Freddie Mercury. Yeah higher pick which is nothing really very special but it's very entertaining. Yes, hugely crowd-pleasing entertainment. The critics hated it the good excited it while it's great. It's quite it's eminently watchable and for anyone of a certain age, I mean queen was just all over the 70s and most of the a 80s now I never bought the queen record, but but you have to admit they they gave good rock. Oh definitely. I was very lucky to go to all the early Queen concerts. I really yeah, you are privileged. Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And I just I would go to other gigs that my friends were talking about and I would say God this is this is rubbish, you know, because I'm my first few get wise to go to the Marquee Club in London and say a lot of small bands which were great. But my first Stadium gig was a queen gig so I was like, Let me spoil on the Waterworks tool and when it came to Live Aid I wasn't surprised I was like the other band States quote great and some other bands were great. But you know, I'd like Sade playing bass line for 10 minutes before they actually got into their song Along Comes Queen and just like blows everyone knows everyone knows everyone else away in that I knew that this is what they would do because I'd seen them before the other. The other one is another Netflix production called the spy with Sacha Baron. Aaron Cohen, I don't know if you know the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen Dido. He has it Borat and yeah things but this is as far as I'm aware his first serious acting role. There is a major first. It's a very good film. It's a series of day. I think it's a six part series on Netflix very very the true life story of a Israeli spy who infiltrated the the top level of the Syrian government quite incredible true life story, but Sacha Baron Cohen is outstandingly good in this and the reason I mention the connections because I believe Sacha Baron Cohen was originally lined up to play for any Mercury. Yes. He was yes, he's I think he's brilliant the Common Thread here because we've talked about this a bit in the past is it seems easier much easier for good Comics to become good serious dramatic actors either way around I believe so I'd interesting. I mean, I think it's much harder to do what he's done in the past, you know his comedic work than and I I wouldn't be surprised if his acting is absolutely outstanding, but but Guido look, thank you so much for your time, and there's something	1.0
Musicians and so on and the lifestyle so answers kind of suspect but what I understood as long as long as you got the sex and the drugs who needs the Rock and wrong definitely impressed me so much was it came out that he was such a good person. Yeah. He was a lovable person. It was good to others. He was just a positive influence on all others around it and this reminded me of another thing there. Documentary has seen many years before about alphabets right Elvis.	1.0
Yes. Yes. He was the same thing.	1.0
It's not just the music is something about the person it is This Walter. It radiates as Goodwill exactly on all others around it people lost it not just because of music but because of the person this is I think is very important lesson there as well. Right? So if you if you want to lead people well, You should maybe start with yourself turn yourself into a better person, right?	1.0
If you want to exercise a good influence on others around something that we see much in politics now intake quite the reverse but Guido, I'm sure old Allison's would want to get in touch with you if they had a people reach you what's the best are you on Twitter or Vine?	1.0
No, no. No. I mean I mentioned that freak but I don't even have Netflix right so I watch Netflix last year when I was on sabbatical in the u.s. At home. We don't have to be we don't have Twitter. We don't have Facebook. I think my girls have grown up girls. So they have Facebook, but they even they they don't use anymore. So we are very not.	0.0
How do you do? How do you perfect balance their how have you done that Guido?	1.0

That's do. I hope we can meet in person.	1.0
Absolutely. Absolutely you have come to London. Just please let us know.	1.0
Well, yeah, actually I come to London at the end of November brilliant. We'll be in touch.	1.0
Thanks very much indeed. Line up by now that was fascinating absolutely loved it. So interesting really really interesting just before we came on air you were mentioning the House of Commons. Yeah, the I think we must be watching this. I forget the Channel's name because it was either the BBC News Channel or BBC Parliament and possibly both because we ended up switching off at about 10 o'clock in the evening and we started watching roughly lunchtime and I I tuned in to catch boris's statement returning from New York after the Supreme Court ruling and actually it was almost one of those entertaining afternoons of my things in my life. So for anyone asked to see me, you must watch if it's not the full show that at least the highlights of Jeffrey cocks the Attorney General because it was absolutely a PST A Pas du tout pas de resistance. Unbelievably full-blown that the whole works in the guys going to this is amazing roaring baritone anyway, but he just he just blew blew the opposition away. I think there were there were heavy expectations coming into yesterday because we're recording this on Thursday the 26th 26th of September. So it's a few days just a few days after the Supreme Court ruling that invalidated the Pierogi of Parliament and there's an expectation coming. Into the commons that know that they were going to Duff up the attorney general and follow up by duffing up Boris and my god did those expectations get reversed very very quickly. So first the Jeffrey Cox in this is fantastic and hilarious and then you have you know, the man himself. So Boris came in and basically just gave no quarter and there's a very appreciate what Dido just said about social media. He's absolutely right, but if you do have the To engage with say Twitter. There is a very special pleasure that can come with engaging with Twitter while simultaneously watching a big event and the Parliamentary session was a big event. So it's almost that's that's what it's designed. Almost all yeah always had become as a mixture of Theater Grand guignol black comedy. I don't know how to describe it. I'll be I'll be looking at grand grand. What does that thing? I couldn't tell you I decided to extend impressive but the Macabre so I've always interpreted, but I don't You know the full definition Barack possibly. I'm just starting at mindless French words now either. What's I don't know what's happening and being taken over by Spirit of Madness. But Boris launches at there was no Contrition. No apology was General Gregory an to the power of infinity and during during the proceedings. Basically, he's worked out perfectly how to be the world's most successful troll on the back of perhaps the success of gone. From so he started using the phrase surrender Bill about the Hilary Benn act which is basically means to be can't can't leave without a deal and every time he used the term surrender Bill the opposition benches would just get would just get more and more Angry. So course you would then continue to use the phrase surrender bills that why you change your Twitter hand. So I've changed my Twitter handle to surrender a bill cousin of surrender bill, but last night I was just having the funniest. Time of it and then I thought okay. Let's really go for it. And I said could everybody please stop using the word surrender Bill hashtag surrender Bill and then I think followed up with the first rule of surrender bill is due not mentions do not talk about surrender Bill. The second rule of surrender will is do not talk about surrender Bill and those have been my most popular tweets ever. So everyone has been filed in and it was extraordinarily funny how that must is so much fun. But on honest on a slightly more sobering note D. The one thing that Also kind of a last night was I think was Barry Sherman and some woman who is named. I don't even want to remember from the Labour party the amount of hostility rage blind rage real hateful rage that came back up Boris is it was a sight to believe and for what? It's worth. I'm and I'm clearly on one side of debate among arm the pro breaks it side but it struck me that I think labor and the lib Dems have called the public mood a hundred percent wrong on this so when they're saying own, Where the language is in temperate and in moderate and all the rest of it? I think they're no because what Boris was doing yesterday was he was giving a like a sort of a Channel of venting for those of us those Seventeen point four million people who basically felt completely cheesed off the last three and a bit years and he's actually no lightning rod for the for the opposition but an opportunity for those those sitting there not a trivial number of people who frankly have felt cheated and betrayed and he's now he's now just Taken the taken the fight to Parliament in those small way. I know anything can happen. But what do you what do you think the next steps are II couldn't even begin to say because I mean, I'm no expert in Parliament procedure and there's been but apparently neither. Does anybody else this writing the laws now as they go on I saw a headline saying that Boris had lied to the queen or something is that these terms are very nuanced. So I'm again stress. I'm no expert but my take on it is that at Boris had perfectly Sound Advice perfectly credible advice from his legal people including the Attorney General to do what he did your ocean to the mechanics as that basically said dismissing Parliament to then reinstating it the later date and that was all deemed to be sufficiently legal for him to go ahead and meet the queen and then the Supreme Court Bear in mind that also a number of very high-profile local British Justice. People also approved it and then the Supreme Court 11 to nothing decided that it was it was technically unlawful. But I think is Boris himself said what's really happened is that the legal system has been brought in it to a pine on these it has no matter talking about it has nothing to do with politics. This is the last thing you really want to happen in terms of the UK the British constitution. It is not for the courts to decide what parliamentary procedure ought to be. Like it's none of their business and you know, because we've got hundreds and hundreds of years of precedent to draw upon and people are now that that is exactly what gido is talking about in relation to the elites. Now when the elites had cornered they will do absolutely anything to you know to ensure that they win. Well, I think in this case this is this is a classic example of a Battle Royal where neither side is backing down, but the difference is know that there was a simple majority the leave And that simple majority a total of 17 and a half million people have been ignored for us three years. So no surprise that they're angry that I'm angry. And so there's a phrase that John Lanchester used it in one of his pieces a while back guy who writes for London of your books that somebody going to quote ridiculous Basil's 40-ish lengths unquote to achieve something and that's what the remain cap of done. So they're driving a coach and horses through historical precedent through law. You're through normal parliamentary life through everything just to overturn a perfectly legitimate vote. It's quite sickening. Really. Are you have some I know some people who are remain has and I get I detect that they are starting to get weary with it as well. You know Whitney nothing. Yeah, if we're not careful something get killed. Well, I say that in all sincerity. I don't mean it to have her that wanted to happen. But if trust me when you see the footage of certain labor and peas just that does blind with Fury just lashing out at Boris is deeply unsettling. Well, we can still get there. Can we is that particular YouTube and I've had some this morning on some more happy topics. I just want to say a couple of shout. Shouts first of all to Dixie Deville on YouTube.

I don't know if you remember but I did a quick interviewed everyone on Derrick storm. And we did like a phone or a I think everyone just passed her on the phone. We're like next next you remember that number? Okay. It's good to put a face now. Yes, but what I think was really interesting was that Pasha was the one who actually encourage you to do Derrick storm. Yes, and I you know you guys A team and you guys have to make decisions as a team. You have a studio you compete together.	1.0
So I was glad to see the Dancing with the Stars was something that you were able to yeah, it really is do it was so great because thing was Derek story was my first tour ever and it was hard because it was three months long with the preparation and everything and that meant I had to move to California for just a little bit for the rehearsal period and being that we live in New York not to see him for three months was Only extremely difficult so he did come out and see me like time to time. But of course, it's not the same when you're living together know right away the moment I got Dirk's called to be on this tour Tasha said I don't care what you do. You're not even going to think about you're doing this tour. He's like it's not just for you. It's for us because we want the world to see way more basically ballroom dancing has been seen as all Glitz and glamour, you know, that's and rhinestones and which is great but great hands. Right and at the same time like even in our competitive career whenever we danced Ballroom, it was really more pedestrian type of Ballroom where you get up and you wear jeans and t-shirts and you make it sexy without all the rhinestones which we saw in World of Dance right season 2. Yes, exactly. And that's exactly what we wanted to deliver. So the fact that I was able to kind of go into Derek store and like really fresh out of the competition floor and just do what I love to do and just kind of Be as partner on tour, which was great at the same time. It was just so great for Pasha and his family. So it was it was definitely something I shouldn't have thought twice about but the only reason I did thought think twice about it was just because Pasha was in New York.	1.0
So that was really difficult well, and it's wonderful to have that support because not everyone does get that type of support say go do the tour.	1.0
This is for us absolutely and it's actually funny because when we did get the call that we're going to be on Dancing With the Stars the first thing was They called me in there like Daniella we have great news and we have not-so-great news. And the first thing they said is Basha is going to have a celebrity partner the season and I was like, oh my God, that's amazing. That's the best news ever and then they're like, well this season we just won't have one for you this season, but you know, it's we hope you can still like be okay with him being like are you kidding me this doing Dancing with the Stars? Absolutely like the fact that we're just here together and Bosh. It's too like we're both living this together. It's we're in this together. So whether I have one or he has one, it doesn't matter. It's where a family and the fact that we're we can both live.	1.0
Our dreams here is just we're just so grateful and you book being California together that that helps quite a bit. Did you participate at because you were on tour, I think when this happened the actual audition, I know they had an audition in the spring or were you guys were you on tour and submitted a video?	1.0
I actually I never got a chance to come in and do the audition. Pasha was doing the audition while I was on tour and then they asked me to just submit a video in and I did that like I've got some stuff with Derek Hough.	0.0
Would you like it? I totally did that.	1.0
I totally would do like Derek. Are you okay with me submitting our video?	1.0
He's like sure he just admitted it but I understand I mean what else would you submit I'd be like I'm dancing with Derek Hough every night it was he when a couple more about like six on the show you you know, is that a good reference and I was so lucky that he was able to do that with me.	1.0
And just submit it together. That was amazing.	1.0
So that's incredible. And I you know, I'm really kind of like I was thinking about you today because what you guys decide to do going on World of Dance season 2 the steps that have happened since that appearance, you know, I feel like one thing wouldn't have happened. If you hadn't decided to do World of Dance to begin with I feel like it just opened The Floodgate hundred percent honestly all the stars aligned and it's it's been insane because again,	1.0
World of Dance wasn't in our plans. So they found us they asked us to be on the show and they found us through our YouTube video.	0.0
Okay, because I know they slide into DM is a lot on Instagram.	1.0
Yes, and that's actually how they found us. And we basically we were in like the jeans and t-shirt kind of thing and they saw it on YouTube they loved it and they're like, we need something like this on our type of show. So we're like, you know, what why not we can compete and we can do something like this that's super creative on the side and it's the best platform where we can just show what we're all about because there you're not in a ballroom dance competition there you're in just you're in a mix of just gorgeous dancers. And again, you're just super grateful of a be there and you look around just like the best hip-hop and contemporary dancers and Jazz dancers old from all over the world and credible. It's so it was so so cool. So that decision was super easy. We're like, all right. Let's try, you know, try something new. We've never done that before and we are so grateful we did and we did. Make it that far but like we definitely got great exposure from there's people started contacting us and recognizing us for what we do and that was the biggest thing and it was just again, we're just super grateful to be there.	1.0
I've noticed that because we've had a lot of the World of Dance contestants here in this studio and making it different parts of the competition whether we've had winners and we've had people that made it halfway or people that you know, made it even just around and it's been interesting because they said everyone has Said the exposure is unbelievable. It's a global show and the benefits that they have reaped just from appearing on the show.	1.0
No matter what the result was has been incredible for their career 100% I mean, I remember just waking up like we did our episode of the world the I think it was like the first round or something qualifiers. Yeah, and I wake up in the morning and I have probably like two thousand followers like it was in so overnight. Yeah. It was Insanity are oh, there we are.	1.0
Yes, and how you do it was coming. I love it that you're like hey, here we go. Yeah, um, we're did you know Derek before you did World of Dance and just from beat? No, I did not interesting.	1.0
I knew of him and I think we bumped into each other like time to time because I don't know if you guys know who she really balances. She's pretty much like my dance mom. She's marked ballots as Mom.	1.0
We are very familiar. Shirley's been in the studio many times.	1.0
Yeah. She is honestly just The best dance mom ever she's taking care of me since I was nine years old and just directed me and in anything and everything and just wanted me to try everything and succeed in life. So basically she was my go-to and being that were really close with each other you were in the orbit of like are exact. Yeah my Derek Mark really like always bumping into each other and Mark I'm closer to but yeah before World of Dance, we don't really know each other so fascinating.	1.0
Yeah, Shirley Ballas let like since you mentioned her I mean I think we should talk about her because anyone who's never met Shirley Ballas this she's a queen. She is a queen not only is she a world-class Ballroom dancer herself. She's on the head judge on Strictly Come Dancing. If I highly recommend that you go to YouTube and start searching for some of her videos with Corky Ballas and some of their dances because they are spectacular.	1.0
I mean she does not lose shape. She's like you go into a lesson with her and I'm very visual. So for me, it's very important for my teacher to be able Able to show me what they mean and rather than just verbally explaining it. I need to see it. Right. So the fact that she can even do the things she does is remarkable. She gets up. She does her back basic into fan and some Ballroom step since like you don't want to you don't want to actually go after that because you're like, I don't want to follow that direction.	0.0
I love that. She's still they'll throw her into dances on Strictly Come Dancing and she's just like I got this here we go a hundred percent.	1.0
I mean that woman is just she's an iron.	1.0
Eddie what have you learned from her because I also think that she's a good life lesson type of Mentor. Absolutely.	1.0
So I actually posted recently on my Instagram a picture and it was just like a picture of me and just like very open. So personally, I was always very shy and I never really wanted to try new things and I was very close and Just in general I would I like to be in my bubble and ever and ever like to try anything new. So she was always trying to get me to do different shows and whatnot. And then she always said to me trust the process. This is something that since I was a little kid she was just telling me non-stop if I always doubted my like if I doubted myself or whatever it was she said trust the process everything happens for a reason if your I remember just like losing one competition. We were like next in the final or something like that and I remember coming out of that cup. Shouldn't and I was just so sad. I was like, oh my God, whatever I'm doing. It's just not happening. It's I don't know. What like what what else could I possibly do to be in that final and this that and the other and she's like trust the process. It happened for a reason and it definitely did because I remember the next competition. I was so hungry for it and I wasn't I was just trying to do I wasn't trying to compete with anybody else. I was really just competing with myself and trying to improve myself more and I remember that petition ended up in the final and doing really well. So like things like that. She always let me know that everything happened for a reason and if something didn't happen it's meant to be that way and funny enough about two years ago. We tried out for Dancing With the Stars. Oh you did and we didn't get it and I was like all this you know, this is something I really want. I've I've always watched the show and I'm like super big fan and it's something I've always wanted to do. When we got the call that we weren't going to be on it. I was actually really sad and I was talking to her about it and she's like then it wasn't your time. It's right just continue doing what you're doing. And that's actually when we went on World of Dance. Oh, yeah, we want door closes exactly how the door open and that year. We actually tried out we auditioned for World of Dance. We got onto World of Dance and we kept competing. We kept perfecting our technique and and then when we did get the call for this year's Dancing with the Stars real	1.0
Like okay Shirley's right again. This is why she's always right.	1.0
She's always here always right and that's exactly why it happened and now being on the show. I still have my technique that I was perfecting for those extra two years, you know and trying to be the best that I could be and now I'm really grateful.	1.0
I can just bring it on that show, you know, so well we are, you know, I was at the show last night and everyone I talked to was like Danielle and Pasha are like the best dancers know they are so complementary they are so happy that you are there they love watching. Dance spoiler alert guys, Brandon Armstrong was here before Daniela because we pre-taped an episode that's going to are October 22nd because I'll be in Barcelona so I know I can't wait but he was bragging about the two of you. He's so sweet and but everyone's really appreciative of your talents and what you guys are both bringing to the show this year.	1.0
Thank you. We're having a lot of fun. And again, it's it's nice to have like that appreciation, you know, because sometimes you do do a job and it's kind of like right next, you know, so and here people appreciate what you do no matter who you are. So we're just so blessed to be on the show. Honestly. It's been nothing but an amazing journey so far.	1.0
So so for people who follow the show, we know we are seeing all the pros but they're celebrities. But what has your role been kind of on a day-to-day basis with Keo where you don't have the celebrities, but if you're needed for big dances your there, are you going to rehearsals are you helping out if they need, you know someone to sort of shadow?	1.0
Okay, so basically what they're doing this year is the Tau Chi oh and I see you and I are the newest like not the newest. Sorry Josh and I are the newest Pros but q and R are the pros that don't have celebrity Partners this year and it's because basically as people get eliminated or they usually like would go home and they would whatever this season Once you get eliminated you kind of join the pros. So like for example Brandon was eliminated with Mary now, he's joining Keo and I so it becomes more like a professional group of people like dance together and different numbers. So what we do is basically we're also hired so God forbid anyone gets hurt that day of the performance. We feel like fill in for that step if anything up. Yeah knock on wood think got everything. Okay, that's one thing. Another thing is we're going to be in every opening number q and I are actually doing the how tos this season. It's which I love you think it's	1.0
So fun, I think it's been important to to describe like this is what the judges are looking for.	1.0
This is the content it makes a lot more sense to every 100 percent and the fact that we get to do just some basic steps together and just show America what it's supposed to look like. So like let's say Argentine to our just a regular Tango, right Ballroom Tango. They show like I don't know. How long is it like 20 seconds of it, but they show what it's supposed to look like. So in the audience at home is watching they can relate to it. Okay, that's what it's supposed to look like. Well his I'm wasn't exactly like that. So I guess I see what Lana is talking about. Exactly. It's tough.	1.0
Like there's a connection now, so I think that's so smart of them to do because people do forget what it's actually supposed to look like and because in the prior Seasons, we've kind of gone away from some of the ballroom and some of the other styles kind of came in and then it was a fusion style but Going Back to Basics I think makes a lot of sense for the show.	1.0
Yeah, so cute and I get to do that and we have so much fun together. He's great. He's so fun. We had him here about a month ago. I love him. Yeah, he's a great dancer. He's a great human being Thanks for dealing with him on a regular basis is so much fun. Like rehearsals. Don't feel like rehearsals. It just feels like we're hanging out as friends, you know, so it's been really fun and also on the days off that we don't have anything. We like to just come into the studio and just keep practicing our Basics and perfecting them. So when they do need us, we always look like the best that we can possibly start all the time. So no matter what we always have an agreement that we show up to the studio and we practice as much as we can together so that lets say for the opening number if they need us they call us and we're ready to go at any	1.0
any moments, you know, that's what they had happens with other athletes on sports teams where they're called Off the Bench. Well, if you're called in at any time, you have to be ready to go and then also shows that there's a lot of effort behind the scenes to producers take notice of that I have that's important.	1.0
Yeah, and it's great because I actually love dancing at him because he's so much bigger and taller. Hmm. It's it makes me feel more like secure and like a woman and you know, he's very masculine as a dance very strong. Yeah. So I feel like we work really great together good.	1.0
I'm really happy to hear that. I love Kyo. I have nothing but fantastic that he's so positive to yes, and that is very infectious. I think when someone walks in a room and kind of sets the tone, you're like kyo's here. Yeah. I'm really happy and everything else and I saw him at Derek's where I know that he came to see you guys. I actually didn't see him there. He was there.	1.0
He said he's ahead of me and I was like, I didn't see you and he's like how you just like right up quickly and you're like, hey, I'm sorry. I was like, so in the zone that I didn't like seeing her. I promise you he was there I can vouch.	0.0
- right. Yeah, say hello and have a quick conversation with him. Brandon was talking about the fact you guys are headed to Disneyland this week to film which I think is going to be so incredibly exciting and I was like, I would just want to go down there and watch because you guys have no idea what's coming. It's gonna be insane in a the best way possible you get to work with Zach woodlee Have you ever worked with fact before?	1.0
I haven't but we just had our first rehearsal for the opening number and he's so cool. He's just so cool to work dick. It's like boom boom boom. Boom. Boom done very fast with your great-aunt just he has like this break flow about him to you know, like he does bits and pieces of choreography, but then when he fuses them together, it just works like everything kind of just flows one piece into the other and you kind of don't even have to think about it.	0.0
It just your body just does it so, it's great what I love about his choreography and he did Grease live is that he creates something that's so iconic like grease you're like, oh, well, I know how this number goes. Nope. Watch what Zacks going to do. He's going to give you a whole like different spin on a classic. Eric but he also has a High School Musical the series is coming out. Yeah, he's got a lot, you know in the mix so he's someone that is out there working all the time. So I love the shows kind of bringing in like when you guys work with cat Burns a couple weeks ago.	1.0
So great. She's already so good. She's also really knowledgeable, you know, like when she talks to you about the camera angles and just all the different styles you should do and like more from to like she just knows her craft, you know, so and I don't know if a lot of people	1.0
I did an interview with with cat the week you guys worked with her but there was concept changes at the last minute and she had to change she she had worked on something for three weeks and they're like, we're not going to go in this direction.	0.0
We're going to different direction and she had to start from square one about three days before but being on a show like this, like if something doesn't work, you have to change it, you know, right there should be a lot of like little tiny changes here and there but when there's a drastic change she was able to just snap into it and just like Curry. Eight the coolest great.	1.0
I love that number to yeah, and that's the talking about being like flexible flexible and like nimble. That's what they talked about and Cat Burns knocked it out of the park with that. Yeah. Do you wind up helping Pasha at all with Tom's his numbers with Kate?	1.0
Absolutely Yeah, we actually do the choreography a lot together in our living room.	1.0
So but how great is that? You just comes home and he's like, all right. I got this idea.	1.0
Yeah. It's like all right wides are due tomorrow. Let's let's do some Cory. I'm like, let's do it, you know make it happen best in our living room. Is because our mind just like really even for competitive career if we needed to do some kind of showcase every choreography that we've ever done together was done in our living room and that was always our best one whenever we went to the studio. It just didn't work. I think we were just like so stressed about time when you're home. There's no time restriction at night you just go and you can't look kind of like look at some YouTube videos get inspired and just sit have coffee and things just go.	1.0
Well you're in your own environment to so there wasn't this pressure of like well we rented The studio for two hours and actually we have to be out of there because someone else is coming on it or something. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big difference. You guys were big office fan. So when Pasha got paired with Kate, this must have been a little ridiculous. Okay. So let me tell you the story. It's good. It's a good one.	0.0
Yeah, so, okay. Basically we had a meet and greet for the Dancing with the Stars cast and we didn't know who was going to be on it. We had no idea what kind of celebrities wanted to do the season, so we're kind of just we also got the call that We're going to be on dancing stars three days before Good Morning America.	1.0
So and you guys live in New York and you're having us even though Good Morning America's in New York. You still 2-pack of your life because you're like guys were moving to LA but that's a whole another story.	1.0
So we knew three days before. So again, we come in like we're setting up for the meet and greet Bashas like iron shirt were obviously turning on the office and funny enough. It was on live TV, so that was great. So watching the office and I'm like crap, you know, I have to go to this meet and greet right now, and I just really To finish this episode. It was like so good. I think it's the one when Jim proposes to Pam or something like that and I'm like, oh my God, this is the best like so good. Just want to watch it and we're like, okay, whatever. We'll just we'll go on Netflix later and like finish watching the episode. I'm like, okay, so we go to the meet and greet. And Sasha Farber turned around to me and he's like, oh my God Meredith is here. I'm like, what? Wait, who's Meredith? Yeah. Wait. What do you mean? He's like Danny Meredith is here. I'm like, what are you talking about? I turn around and she's standing right behind me and I'm like, you're in my living room.	1.0
You're in my living room right now.	1.0
What are you doing behind me? Like I was so shocked. I was mind-blowing.	0.0
It's like your TV opened up and she stepped into the living room the craziest thing this far to be honest.	1.0
Like I just turn around she's right there and I'm like, oh my God, I don't know how that what do I do with my hands? Like I was like literally I was like, okay, I have to go talk to her. So Josh is freaking out obviously because he doesn't know who's his celeb is going to be it. I'm like Pasha we need to go say hi to her and I obviously like hugged her like a crazy fangirl, but it's okay. She still loves me.	1.0
She's so nice. She's so nice.	1.0
Yeah. She's like the coolest and I'm like Pasha. I don't care what you you're going to have her. Like celebrity partner, please. Like do whatever you can't he's like obviously he can't do anything about it.	1.0
But I'm like, please make it happen like praying.	1.0
Oh my God that she would be the best partner for him, especially because it's his first season. She's so cool. She's so funny. She's the most humble person like she's like just the greatest human being you know, so I'm like I'm like the best would be for him to get this partner and then I'm like after Good Morning America. Are we still don't know who's With who and then finally we found out and we were on cloud nine. It was just the best feeling ever and it's so great because right away like even at the meet and greet we had a great chemistry together good and it's so funny because there was like a picture for the Good Morning America cast and we happen to be standing all three of us next to each other like partial. Look. It's like our family portrait here like we made this happen. Yeah.	1.0
It was so cool. She's just a cool and I think what's important to is that Kate was very open to having Pasha because when you get told Have the new Pro sometimes people are like, whoa! Wait a minute. I want the pro that's been here for five six seasons. She was right away. She was like, he's the perfect partner for me.	1.0
Oh my God. He's honestly the greatest human being he's just like so so I mean knock on wood thing. Like we've been together for ten and a half years and we have yet to have a big fight knock what I'm telling it's like the craziest thing because he's Buddha literally to get his very even-keeled, isn't he? So and I'm very straightforward. So for me, like if something bothers me, like I say it right away. There's no like, oh nothing's wrong. If there's something wrong. You'll know there's something wrong.	1.0
Yeah. You're like a mad.	1.0
Yeah, and this is why you know, and he's like, oh my God, I'm so sorry like, okay like we always talk so knock on wood. We have yet to fight good and he's just so inspiring to and you're not in a great mood. He knows how to like lift you up and make you feel comfortable. And I think that's what she needs as well because no one really knew what she can do on the show and you know, She's super talented when she does but no one has ever seen her dance before and that's difficult when you're not a dancer, you know, so I feel like he's the perfect partner for her to just make her feel comfortable and no matter what just support her and they work so well together. They have the best chemistry.	1.0
So I'm just so happy for him and for her that they get to work well together, you know, and that's really special to because having your first celebrity on Dancing With the Stars, you'll always have that memory and you want it to be a good one and So I love that it's playing out and I love that. The fans are reacting to their partnership to yeah, people are really enjoying them super positive.	1.0
I mean, he's just so lucky to have her and vice versa, you know, like they're just so perfect for each other.	1.0
I was asking her last night in the Press line at Dancing with the Stars just how her comedy has helped her because she is a physical comedian when you watch her on the office and she said, you know, I don't dance but I was a good imitation. That was actually pretty good. I've watched a little bit of the office myself, but she's at least an understanding of how her body moves and I think that has sort of helped her.	1.0
It doesn't perfect her Ballroom technique, but it is definitely really good at like jazz your type things and like the Pumped kind of dance move. She's really natural at it. Like there's some things. I remember Posh. I came home from one of the first like rehearsals he has with her and they did a Cha-Cha and they had like this like funky move in there. He's like, it's just I didn't teach like I don't have to teach her that she just did it naturally and she just made it look great. So he's like I have to use that because her like comedic skills and like the way she moves her body when she does do her comedy is very simple like similar to the Cha-Cha or Jazzy or quick subtype 5, so it's very easy for him to teach her that kind of stuff. But when it comes to the technique, obviously, it's very difficult, right? She does a great job learning it. So there's definitely a great sense of her body awareness. She knows what she's doing. Not so it's very helpful.	1.0
It definitely helps because you do have some contestants that don't know where their hips are located or how to move their hips. That's when someone does have body awareness. You're like, okay, we will get to this place the other people you're like, I'm not sure. Yes it is. That's really what it is and Dent Disney night I think is going to be good for them.	1.0
Oh my God. I cannot wait for you guys to see it.	1.0
Yes, and I think it's contemporary. They have contemporary jazz. It was on the present released its on the press release so I can actually it's Jazz. Yeah. I was like you forgot contemporary jazz But it's been released by ABC. So you're not in trouble. I'm here to tell you that we will not be getting phone calls. It's out there on Twitter. In fact, it's in my feet. If you guys want to see the full press release of what is happening.	1.0
Yeah, she has Jazz this week and so far. She's been killing. I mean they've only had today I think they started today because it's like we're I think we're going to Disneyland tomorrow.	1.0
Yeah. I was like Brandon said that you guys were going tomorrow and Thursday.	1.0
I don't remember what day of the week. I'm in. Sorry.	0.0
It's not the same that you goes. What do you say like today's Tuesday? Because we go tomorrow.	0.0
Yeah, so we go tomorrow and then we stay there and then we're there Thursday, I think so. It's going to be a little bit stressful. They're not going to have as much time together as they usually would but she can be fine.	1.0
I think she's going to be totally fine with jazz because she can handle that type of style and she just needs to trust herself because she's picking up the choreo. It seems pretty quickly.	1.0
Yeah, I'm gonna be so good. You know it. I don't know about that. I'm excited. I'm happy to see that we did it in our living room yesterday. It looked great.	1.0
But in between the show or last night Monday night after the show we had to do the choreo were like already starting to brainstorm.	1.0
And of course he did like his research and we had some help and like looking up some videos and stuff like that.	1.0
So hopefully you get the concept of everything that's good. Let's talk a little bit about Derek Hough because I'm sure let's talk about Derek because obviously he's had a huge history on Dancing With the Stars but Working with him really started with World of Dance where he was a judge for you. Do you think that he saw you and you know Pasha dance and it probably was thinking I want to work with these two at some point in the future.	1.0
Did he ever tell you that or share that with you know, honestly, like I just remember on the show because there's just so many people in the show and I can't blame him like he sees so many act today and like, oh the qualifiers are there laws overwhelming. Yeah. It's so overwhelming, so I'm not Expecting him to like remember every performance we do or everyone does but I do remember on the show. He did say that what he called me called me a good zeiger a tiger mix with a gazelle.	1.0
Gazella. Yeah, I guess I guess I think time a geiger I think it was a good idea.	1.0
I don't know. It's one of its what I thought. Oh, I think it was like a gazelle entire. Yes, that kind of thing. So yes, I remember that and then actually I think it was Shirley Ballas who? He came to for like a girl he needed a girl for his music video for natural. You're his friend was like doing the rendition for him and stuff. So he's like, do you have like some kickass girl? Can I say you can take you got your good girl, you're fine saying kick ass, and there's no problem. So she's like a real contact one. She contacted me and she's like, all right, you have two days to get your act together and ship your stuff to LA and just do this music video because I remember it was right before the international Dance, World Championships.	0.0

So it was like three days before we had to leave to that in like early. I'm not going anywhere. What are you talking about? Its International dancesport Championship, but you listen to surely don't you I did you're supposed to supposed to and then she's like, I don't care you're going I was like, okay. Well, if you say so I went to LA and I saw Derek there and he's like, oh, this is so awesome. Like and I think he remembered me from yeah, that's what he was like, yes, but then we did that music video and it was just so successful like we had so many views on it and people loved it. They were sharing it for like a year after that. So it was insane. Well, actually it's been it's almost been a it's almost that here.	1.0
It's almost a year believe it or not.	1.0
So getting shared and talked about so there's a very successful music video. Him and I think we worked really well together on that.	1.0
So I'm sure that's probably where he started getting the idea of like tour. Well, he actually asked me that night.	1.0
He he did he we did the music video and he's like listen, I think it would be so cool. If you can come out on tour with me and I'm like, I don't really do that. And also I'm competing but most importantly I have a husband who I don't know if I want to leave her that long right? It's like, of course this is going to be the biggest opportunity of my life and to say no no to that would be so stupid.	1.0
Like there's just a lot to consider though to you can't just go by Pasha and like that take off.	1.0
Yeah, and I was like, I don't know if I can do this without my husband. He's like well bring him with you. I was like, well it's hard because we have all those like students in New York. You can't just leave all our students and you know, so we really had to think about it and Pasha right away said you're going yep and he held down the fort while you were on tour with the your students and did teachers like well, let's not say anything yet, and I told her a red rose. I don't know like we'll see and then once again when he asked me I was like, all right. Well, let's do this like will do the tour and so super fun.	1.0
Oh my God you so your opened up to all the Derek Hough fans who are incredibly supportive. So supportive go to multiple shows do the meet and greets over and over again. He really has an incredible fan base. Yeah, what did you witness? Because one thing I love about Derrick is that that show was on him it was on him to deliver every night it on him to deliver incredible speeches, you know beyond even if he wasn't feeling well he is dynamite at that.	1.0
I don't know if he's human because he was super hero. He was for how long was the show two hours and he was saying dancing talking playing instrument and this is all live it was not fake. Like this is all real stuff. He was it's like you can't fake that kind of stuff, you know, and he was just on stage non-stop. His quick changes were literally like 15 seconds. Wow, it was insane. Like he's just I don't know what he's made out of but that guy is so energetic and he's just so talented and being his partner on tour was actually the coolest experience ever and his fans were so supportive. And what I really liked about him was the fact that he took the time out of his day. He came out of his trailer signed everybody's autograph talk to people so he wasn't kind of like, all right. Thanks guys. Bye he was like, right so involved with his fans and that's so refreshing. Rushing to see and but then again like he treated us like royalty. He got us like spa days and massages to make sure our bodies were okay.	0.0
He took us to like he treated us to dinners and just things he hadn't have to do I was laughing at I don't think everyone knows this but that day that I did the back-to-back-to-back. I talked to all of the dancers. They're all on Dance Network TV if you're looking for the articles, but every single one of you mentioned he got us the Thera gun and he did	1.0
Exhaust foam roller.	1.0
Oh, like sure I Brady. Oh, you got the fancy one. I was so fancy. Like he was just so good about it.	1.0
He just any little bruise on my body. He's like, oh my God, let me get you ice. Like just the nicest person, you know, like sweet and being that that was my first tour. It was just so blown away like the way he was taking care of not just his cast but like people behind the scenes as well.	1.0
He was just crew positions.	1.0
Yeah, just just overall he was just taking	1.0
Care of every single person making sure he there were okay and that's important too because he is a leader this his name is on this tour and you set the tone as a leader and if you come in there with an attitude it trickles down and then it's contagious and everyone's feeling bad.	1.0
But if you're setting an amazing example, yeah, you guys will never forget that tour and even if there was like some tension between choreographers or if something wasn't working and everyone was getting like kind of frustrated. How come I can't get this stuff red wherever he went into the room and right away. His presence just makes Feel like I got this like he's just such a positive person. So it was it was just great like no matter what or how you felt when he entered the room. You just knew everything was going to be okay and you can get through this.	1.0
We had JJ here TJ Jackson by a few weeks ago. He's one of my favorites, but I said I said this to him and I'll pass this on to you when I saw the tour in Los Angeles you guys were at the tail end of the tour oftentimes when you see the tail end of a tour everyone's tired and injured. Heard things don't look as sharp as it did 30 cities ago or anything else like that. You guys were so clean and sharp and looking like it was one week into the tour. I was so impressed with that.	1.0
It was I mean, we did definitely clean up a lot and what I liked about the tour as well as we didn't get too comfortable. So every like two weeks we would try to take well actually every night we would take one dance and we would Like that one dance to make sure okay. Are we on sorry. I was in the right spot. Are we on our marks? All right. Let's try to make this better. So every single night we'd have one dance we'd focus on so that that night it would be a good like a good quality number with a right positions and makes you like make sure it's clean. So I think because of that it really helped towards the middle and end of the tour to stay clean because we did try and perfect the dances one at a time instead of like kind of Try to do everything will open the whole show doesn't necessarily work. No, so dedicating one day to one dance really really truly helped a lot. And I think that's that was the key.	1.0
Yeah, it made a huge difference because I go and see most of the dance shows and Los Angeles is almost always one of the last tour dates.	1.0
So I get to see with fresh eyes of like, okay, it was stores hurting or this tour is doing great you guys were on point and I think it was like, Because we had like 6 shows one day break to shows one day break 3 shows what it was like always different every week was different. Sometimes we had like two days off in between but I remember the LA show. I think it was like our fifth show that week already. So we're so tired, but we're so excited because we knew so many people in the audience and there were going to be so many celebrities and famous choreographers and we're like everybody we cannot mess up because this is going to be the best show in that. The reaction from the audience was so cool. Like it's just a great show it gave them really.	1.0
Yeah, it was fun to be at the Orpheum because it was jam-packed. It was a lot of familiar faces like intermission was fine because you're like look everyone's here from time.	1.0
You think in World of Dance and dancing with the stars and it was intimidating to like knowing how many important people everyone was important there.	0.0
Literally that hole right whether there are a fan or whether they're krog refer. Yeah.	1.0
It was like the top of the top of the top people were there. So you're like, oh my God if I mess up everyone's gonna see it. We're stressing but I think because we like we're just having such a good time on stage. I don't know if you guys if you watch the show, we were like screaming at each other and like trying to pump each other up during the show.	0.0
Yeah, like playing games on stage making sure like everyone is still in a great mood present and keep that thing in it because it is that's the other thing too when you do a long tour and people don't realize this unless they've been on tour there are times where you start zoning out and you have to stay present because this is the first time most likely that this	1.0
audience is seeing it and you want to give them the same show that you guys kicked off a month before two months before and it was great because the people in the show were so great and it was such a small cast. I think it was only eight of us all together including Derek. So it was such a good intimate cast that it felt like such a small little family traveling America together. It was so cool. It was just always uplifting. We never had drama like it was just always super that's helpful to Super positive. Yeah.	1.0
Nah I think drama having a good solid case. There's no you know what Derek wouldn't put up with the drama. Yeah. That's right. It would be like we gotta nip this in the bud absolute now. Yeah, and I wouldn't want to be the one that's on tour causing the drama because Derek will be like, yeah, there's eight of us like definitely yeah drama. It was great. That's so good tour. Obviously team nappytabs was sort of organizing everything behind the scenes you worked with a lot of fantastic where ographers some from World of Dance as well. What was that like is nappytabs. They have their hands on everything these days they are. Working everywhere. They're doing Jennifer Lopez's Super Bowl halftime show.	0.0
I'm not gonna lie. I totally fangirled over them.	1.0
Did you when I first met them you met them on world as an season two, right?	1.0
I started and that will we don't really get to spend time with him because they were so busy.	1.0
Obviously there were like doing the whole show ya they're creative producing directing the show.	1.0
So it was like intimidating, but when we met them one-on-one, they're just the sweetest couple and they're just like the ultimate definition of couple goals there. So in love and their sound is the cutest thing in the world and in is adorable.	1.0
He's very precocious. He's so smart.	1.0
He was always like like playing and doing his thing but nappytabs were just so cool to work with they were very positive always positive made sure that you got if you didn't get it, they would always explain them. Like just just the most amazing people so cool to work with them.	1.0
I always think it's interesting to and you know, this is who Derek is also choosing to help, you know, creative direct to show Again, similar type of leadership quality so I've got to imagine like working underneath that tons of great Showbiz lessons right there for sure.	1.0
And the way they work together was great because if Derek didn't like something or he wanted to change something there were always on like on the same team. It was nice to see a whole team of people work together. There was again no drama. It was just like getting shit done.	1.0
Yes, get it get it get it done. It was like just all right.	1.0
We have this amount of time we need to do this this that and the other And they work together. They made sure they put on a good show and it was out the door we went so so good was just a good experience. Yeah, the way they work together was great.	1.0
I'm glad to hear that everyone that works at to not be tops. They have they're so funny to they are and not I love that. They're mentoring so many people to you see a lot of people from World of Dance go and work as there supervising choreographers or even just dance Captain's they're really bringing up a whole other generation behind them to yeah. Just wonderful to see you know, I I know that we have a couple of fan questions while I pull these up. I just want to remind you guys that we are on iTunes as well. I know some of you are watching on video, but if you could take the time to not only subscribe to to the point, we would love for you guys to give us five stars and give us a great review because it helps with exposure bringing people like Daniela into the studio. We love having mad but we love giving more visibility to dance which I always think is so important especially with are so many great dance shows. Going on. Okay. We had a lot of people submit questions. No, but they're good. These are all good question people were really excited because I have if you guys want to join the Facebook group dance dish with KB come and join us over there. We talk Dance all the time. We talk every show World of Dance. So You Think You Can Dance that's all that's what the stars and they submitted questions and all right some of these we have answered. Okay. I kind of like this one. This one's from Zoey she want to No, how do you think you will be different from other Pros on the show Once you get a celebrity partner, have you thought about what you would be like with a with a celebrity contestant because I'm so straight forward.	1.0
I feel like I don't take myself too. Seriously, which is a good thing, you know, so it's there's no I mean, okay. So basically I'm fresh off the competition floor, right? And with that being said, I still feel like I'm practicing my technique and I Teach for a living So and I've had people who've never danced before a day in their life. They have regular office jobs and they just come to me because they want to just just Unleash the Beast with it, you know, so I do have a lot of like gentleman who come in who want to learn how to properly ballroom dance because they want to surprise your wives. That's so sweet and they end up staying and actually taking their wives to the lessons and improving. So I feel like I have so much experience with people who have never danced before and Making them into really beautiful dancers or into just a dancer when you think you can't you know, so I already have that experience. But it I would love to really get to show my personality as well because I do love meeting new people and seeing how like we can work together and stuff like that. So definitely it would have definitely been fun to work with a celebrity partner season 29.	1.0
Let's put this over season 29, you know, maybe that's celebrities. Sweeten for you a year from now you don't talking about your Ballroom competition days. Are you guys like you've retired is it just on the back burner for now? Where do you guys think you are in terms of competing?	1.0
We don't want to say retired because I feel like that's shuts the door. Yeah. I don't want to be finished dancing. Like that's not a thing for me. I don't want to finish my career in that. I feel like you never know what happens again. Like you have to trust the process and let's say you have like a great. Petition in the back of your hand just like hmm. Maybe I can compete next weekend or something that you know, like why you're staying with your Technique you want to make sure that you're ready ready for anything and maybe I don't want to compete necessarily but I definitely want to continue doing shows with Basha because I do love dancing with him and retiring means I don't get to dance with him anymore, you know, so I don't want to think of it like that and I want to think of it just I'm trying something new. I'm still the same dancer. I just have a new audience. That's it. You know, I don't want to finish it.	1.0
We don't have to like retiree. I never tiring we're not I just was thinking like on the competition Circuit of you close orbit.	0.0
I think right now it's just we're so focused on this and we want to really make this our goal and we want to do the best that we can possibly do with this show. And for now, we're not competing because we do your here we want to put all our time love effort everything into this and if we're going to scatter ourselves, it's not going to be good for anything.	1.0
So and you're going out on the Dancing with the Stars tour, correct? Yeah. Pasha is not as of right now as of now, he's not okay, but hopefully but maybe something will change.	1.0
Is he planning on heading back to New York and and teaching and I don't know if he doesn't If he if things don't work out and if he doesn't do the tour, I think he's probably going to go and just do the best that you can teaching and improving himself because you still want to take lessons.	1.0
You still want to guys are young to I like we're not retiring you off, but I think he wants.	1.0
Travel and just teach and again we have so many kids. We like take care of and they're Ballroom career and and a lot of like people even seniors we have actually the three-time 10 dance senior championships you do do and they live in Albany New York. So under the sweetest people ever they have like this whole club called Albany dancesport club and the names were Paul and Louise Giuliano. I love that. They started this whole club and there I don't want to lie. I think he's close close to 70 years old. I think yeah, and there are the three.	1.0
We time US Champions national champions why I wanted Mary Wilson to stay longer to because I think being able and it Kate is over, you know fifty but never too late never too late showcasing like if as long as your body is feeling strong and you're feeling good like showcasing that life doesn't end when you get older it can continue on actually they're people who start when they're 50 so good and they make it and they win national championships.	1.0
We even have world championships for people like that. We have a Pro-Am hold dancesport committee where The teacher competes with their student and we had we actually had women who came in and they've never done stay in their lives and they've been winning like World Pro-Am championships and it's amazing to watch it's so tiring. Yeah, and I love that about Ballroom because not every style of dance has that and I feel like there's a lot of closed doors when it comes to that but in Ballroom, you do have the chance to just go and compete with your student and make them the best they can bought like possibly feel and look and maybe when some titles absolutely like that. Yeah, I like that. Let's see we talked about Derek.	1.0
Let's see. Oh, this is kind of interesting. What was it like working with Lauren Adams She because it was at this was cut. This is Ballroom was new to her, right?	1.0
Yeah, actually the way we ran into her. Okay. So basically she was taking lessons with Shirley Ballas while we brought her in so we usually like to bring her in like book her up. Lessons so she actually was having a proem lesson with her partner with her professional partner and she was new to it. And she I think she had just won the World Championships and like in syllabus or something like that and she like she was so good and Ballroom. She just started Ballroom. Wow, and she saw some the studio one day and she's like guys we need to do a video together and we're like, all right, you know like didn't think anything about like of it and she's like, right so James Bay is coming out. His new single Let it go Let it go Let it go Let it go Let it go.	1.0
I know that kind of thing, but it is let it go let it go.	1.0
So she's like I'm actually entering the contest and I would love to submit a video of YouTube even though it's like a contemporary thing. I just want to do I want to do a ballroom because I feel like it should be a ballroom Rumba song. So we're like, all right, let's do it, you know nothing to lose its just try it and we take that video and I'm like a think it was Ripley greater like one of the New York City very famous studios in New York City and we recorded in Ripley Greer and literally like it was just I think she could she like, mr. Deadline or something like this and she still submitted it with it, like whether it was a desert might as well submitted it and we had like 2 million views on it. Literally we're in like wow practice out father. It is real. I can practice outfits sweating like barely any makeup barely did my hair. Are like showed up danced our Rumba together and it was like 2 million views on YouTube. It was just insanity and then she's like, okay this worked.	1.0
She's like we gotta do it again. She was like this was a genius idea.	1.0
And then she actually we reached out to Kenny wormald. Oh, yes playground Allah.	1.0
We have super amazing hundred videos on Instagram.	1.0
Yeah, and she's like, let's do it. I'm going to be in California. You're going to be in California. Let's meet up or going to use his Studio. Here's a gorgeous space.	1.0
And I'm obsessed with brick and hair like brick wall is so good. And she's like, let's just do it.	1.0
Let's I'm going to direct another video for you. Let's do something cool. And that's when she's like how about you show us a different sites of Ballroom something in like jeans and like ripped jeans and t-shirts and stuff like that and we're like that's a really cool concept. So we filmed that we had another like I don't remember how many of you is exactly it had but it was so successful and till this day people are again are sharing it and talking about it and tagging me in videos and a lot of people actually started being our fans from that video.	1.0
Isn't that funny you think like oh Dancing with the Stars or world of dances The Source, but no, it's Lauren Adams directed this video that went viral, you know, I believable. So Cara thanked you for that question because yeah, obviously it came right back around.	1.0
She actually opened a lot of doors for us when it comes to those videos. Isn't that interesting World of Dance actually contacted us because of that video see yes all it's so funny when you start like putting together when you look at people	1.0
We're using like the Stepping Stones like the Lauren Adams to the World of Dance the Derek Hough thwarted Dancing with the Stars.	1.0
It's amazing.	1.0
It's unbeliev really is unbelievable. Honestly, I like this question to and Chantal asked who are your favorite dancers and choreographers who inspire you?	1.0
Okay deaf, and Alice is surely now. Yeah, sounds like Shirley, but to be honest I get inspired a lot from Contemporary videos or like hip-hop so something that's not Ballroom sometimes of course, like if I'm doing a ballroom practice or something, I'll look at like that. So my favorite girls and I'll just like watch them and see the way they move their bodies and get inspired but a lot of my inspiration comes from hip hop dancers and especially people like his funny but like, you know, Casey rice. Yeah, I know keys right here comes Shawn and Casey are she has no idea who I am, but it's okay, but I'm a put it out there in love with the way. She's connected to her body and especially people like I don't really know her like Jade Jade Chenoweth. Yeah, I'm not really familiar with her. But her work is just I love the way. she's like she's committed into what she does wrong and Fierce and Powerful years people like that really inspire me people like Beyonce when she releases those videos and she has like her hair flying like that also inspires me like her Persona inspires me and I want to be like that like that kind of girl in that Ballroom field because a lot of times like you don't really see ballroom dancers out there, you know and feel like I want to inspire people the way these icons Inspire us, you know, like people like I like that Fela or Beyonce.	1.0
Yes, and the ballroom world has room for that too. I think that's kind of you know, you think this is what Ballroom is now Ballroom can be many many different things different personalities. Yeah. Oh, I like that too. It's a weightless. CR ahead said, let's see this way. I think is interesting. So final question how has the ballroom circuit and Since shaped you as the dancer you are today.	1.0
It has given me everything. I know like I'm just so thankful. I stayed in it for so long because he gave me the technique it showed me how to connect my body properly because everything is done from your Center in Ballroom. All the strength comes from your legs and your Center and hopefully it resonates through your face and through your upper body, you know, so it gave me definitely that strength and connections inside my body. So when I do something that's outside Ballroom, I still feel like I'm able to be connected and look kind of okay fish but it definitely gave me discipline. So on it's good to plan and my body and going through pain, you know and and discomfort and sometimes when you feel like wow, I feel so good today and you look at the video like what is that bad and then like some competitions I walk off the floor and I'm like how like that was. The worst dancing I've ever done in my life and we watched the video with her coach and she's like this is probably one of your best competitions ever, huh? So it always taught me like don't trust your like the interview boy.	1.0
Sometimes you tell her the wrong thing.	0.0
Yeah, you know, so like just try to deliver your absolute personal best and and I'm sure like people will see it. So but I'm very grateful for the discipline that taught me for sure.	1.0

I hope everyone's having a great day today. It's time to gear up for our big cleaning session. And if you're new to the show The Way We gear up for that is to make sure that we look presentable. Whatever that means for you freshen up a little bit. Sometimes we light a candle or turn on a wax warmer or sometimes. It's a matter of just opening a door or a window turning on some. And sliding some fresh air come through if it's a nice day. I know right now. I've got the air conditioner and the fan on so I'm not airing out my house, but I have my wax warmer plugged in.	1.0
I'm not cleaning while I record or anything, but just to give you an idea kind of what I like to do during the day to get comfortable and especially when I'm cleaning.	1.0
I like to make sure that I'm comfortable and a lot of times that means being cool enough.	1.0
Cough.	1.0
So even in the winter, I will go down to just like a cami which is if I don't know people in other countries listening I've realized that there are some new stats available to me. So I realized that only 79 percent of you are in the United States. So some of the terminology with our English could be a little bit different when I just throw out these random terms like I'm wearing a cami but it's a tank top a little spaghetti straps and it's something that I use. As an undershirt when I was out grocery shopping earlier. I had a t-shirt over it like if I'm wearing kind of a low-cut top. I like to wear a cami under it to kind of give me a little bit more coverage in the front but around the house once I start cleaning, I definitely go down to the Kami because I tend to get hot and I guess I'm just not like everybody else. I remember shopping with my mom recently. And she doesn't live near me but when I was in town visiting and she was saying something about well, it's not really the time of year to be buying short sleeve shirts or something. So for me, it's always the time for sure sleeve shirts. I do wear sweaters and jackets and coats when I go out, but I don't	1.0
really like wearing long sleeves	1.0
a lot of times when I'm shopping. I will take my sweater off tie it around my waist or put it in the shopping cart.	1.0
And go down to just a t-shirt with short sleeves and I don't care if it's the dead of winter I get hot.	0.0
So I like to dress in layers. So some of you ladies might be able to relate to that but some of you might be just you know this time of year, you have all of your short sleeve shirts packed away and you switch to long sleeve shirts. I do own a few long sleeve shirts, but it's usually good to wear a cami underneath in case I have to take it.	1.0
Off because even if I were one by myself by itself, I get really hot.	0.0
So just some random thoughts on how I get comfortable to clean, but the less clothing that I have on the better. Basically, let's see taking out the kitchen trash. That's something that I often do to make sure that my house is smelling good we take out the trash every day. We don't live in an area where they have the same. Separate recycle bins.	1.0
Okay. I know some of you are gasping right now, but you know in California, we've lived somewhere where you keep those things separate here. There's just one receptacle and everything goes into that and somebody else goes through that stuff later or whatever. So anyway, that's just what we do here.	1.0
Anyway with a family of six we do. Tend to fill up the kitchen trash every day.	1.0
And sometimes I empty the bathroom waste baskets into it. So that usually needs to be emptied right away.	1.0
And one of the reasons I do that at the beginning of a cleaning session, I take the trash out realign it that way.	1.0
I have somewhere to throw the trash as I'm cleaning the kitchen because you do come across a lot of trash when you're cleaning a messy kitchen and this is a messy Monday folks. So So what that means for me? Is that on the weekend? I'm usually spending a lot of quality time with the family Saturday.	1.0
We were fishing Sunday.	1.0
We had Church. My husband was home spent a lot of time with him. So Mondays are day to recover and I kind of lost a lot of time today just due to an incident that happened when I locked my keys in Car even though I have keyless entry. There's a low battery and I locked them in. So anyway couldn't get the car open and I had to use my roadside assistance.	1.0
But when you're a busy mom and you lose an hour and a half of your time, it can kind of mess up your day. Anyway, I'm trying to remain positive though.	0.0
So, you know, make sure your house smells good make sure you look good and let's get started probably in the kitchen unless you need to straighten up the front entrance of your home real quick. I'm not talking about deeply cleaning the living areas. We'll get to that later in the show, but maybe you need to just kind of pick up. So that the front of your house looks presentable if someone were to stop by or come home early and let's get started in the kitchen.	1.0
Usually when you go into a kitchen you're either going to be removing clutter off of the counter tops or putting away clean dishes. So you might need to throw away some trash. You might need to put away some food.	1.0
You know, maybe there's a box of cereal out or a container of some sort of sauce that people tend to leave out maybe some seasonings that need to be put away.	0.0
Maybe just things that don't belong in the kitchen at all paper clutter.	0.0
What have you, you know male should have a basket that it goes in things like that.	1.0
So if you have clutter get that dealt with so that you can kind of isolate the mess down to just dishes if you have dishes to do You're going to want to put away clean dishes. Maybe you have a drying rack that you need to empty, or maybe you need to empty your dishwasher. And put those things away and if you don't have any dishes to do, you know while I'm talking about dishes just get right into the deep cleaning of your kitchen because some days if you've been, you know cleaning as you go doing dishes after meals, you might not have a messy kitchen. So if that's you this would be a great day to just deep clean your surfaces like, you know, maybe even the inside of your microwave the inside of your fridge.	0.0
You know wipe down your countertops all your appliances and give your floor a good sweep and thorough mopping maybe even on your hands and knees but for a lot of us, we've got to tackle some dishes first.	0.0
So we put away the clean dishes and then it's time to either load the dishwasher or start a sink and when I talk about starting a sink load of dishes, I'm assuming that you fill up the sink with hot. Soapy water, but I realize that some people don't do that. I was watching a little video on Pinterest earlier because I try to to read a lot of cleaning articles and cleaning videos and things to kind of get ideas for the show and make sure that I'm covering everything and that, you know, I'm staying with the trends and it was a video of hacks where they showed like a little holder for your sponge and just some different things to make doing dishes easier. But what I noticed is that they were washing the each dish just in one step.	1.0
They would squirt a little bit of dish soap on it scrub it with a sponge and then rinse it under running water and put it in the drying rack.	1.0
Whereas I do dishes a different way and it doesn't matter how you do them.	1.0
But just to kind of give you some ideas of your options. We'll talk about some of the different ways. But the way I do it is I when I'm hand-washing of course and you guys know that I have a dishwasher so I load the dishwasher first and then a lot of times I handwash what's left or just certain items that I want to be very careful with will be hand washed.	1.0
So when I'm hand-washing I will take the plate for example, and then I'll grab just kind of a brush and under running water.	1.0
Just kind of scrape off that plate. I have a garbage disposal so that can just go right into the sink and I call that kind of a pre-rinse.	1.0
Then that will go into the hot soapy dishwater and I'll do that with several different things until I have a sink load so that it's a hot water with like a dawn or Palmolive in it bubbles.	1.0
Okay, and then I pre-ripped things and put them in there and I start with things like glasses silverware and then I do plates and bowls.	1.0
So, you know those things might all go in together if it's a small amount of dishes, but if it's if it's a large amount then I might have a whole load of just glasses and silverware a whole sink load and I will then use either a dish wand with a sponge on the end of it or a sponge or even a dishrag.	1.0
Just whatever. I feel like using at that time and I will wash the dishes and then rinse them under running water as hot as I can stand and then put them in the drying rack and they do they do soak a little bit before I start washing them because I start out with real hot water and then it soaks a little bit while the water is getting a little bit cooler just to where it's you know, it's not too hot. So there's kind of a soaking involved there.	1.0
That's kind of how I do it and then if the water starts to get dirty, you know, if I was doing just several loads by hand I would drink. Rain it rinse out the sink and start over.	0.0
But typically I'm only doing about one sink load at a time at my house because I have a dishwasher also.	1.0
Now it's kind of a bummer.	0.0
My dishwasher takes upwards of 2 hours and 45 minutes.	1.0
I was really surprised at first the older dishwashers took about an hour newer ones take longer and there's pros and cons. I mean the good thing about the one that took an hour. It was like you'd run it and then you'd load it again.	0.0
Like you wouldn't even have to wash if you had a lot of dishes piling up. You wouldn't even have to hand wash. I mean just be like I'll be back in an hour and do another load but when it's taking over two hours almost three hours, you've got to hand wash the rest of the stuff. Otherwise you're going to end up procrastinating is just going to get too late in the day. So just some thoughts. You might want to time how long your dishwasher cycle is.	0.0
I'm always saying I'm going to time it but I'm pretty sure it's over 2 hours and 45 minutes, but I don't know if I have it down just did the exact minutes, but it takes It sometime so if you do have an older dishwasher on a positive, you can run it back to back, you know in a shorter amount of time, but the positive as you're probably saving money if you have the newer one because it's using less water and maybe less heat.	1.0
Anyway, that's kind of you know, it's energy efficient. So that's the trade-off.	1.0
So you do all your dishes and then once you're done you're going to be cleaning your surfaces, I like to remove any food items, like for example, a fruit bowl a loaf of bread things like that. I have this like two-tiered basket and sometimes I'll have fruit on one level and then bread and tortillas and another one of the baskets.	1.0
I'll usually just move that thing over. to the table When I'm spraying down, my Island. So I like to relocate things when I spray a cleaning product other times.	1.0
I don't want to relocate things. If I don't want to relocate things. I will wipe the counter top with a cleaning wipe or just a damp rag dipped in the soap dish water and then run out, but when I'm doing a little more of a deep clean with the surfaces, I like to remove all food spray them down with a multi surface spray.	0.0
And scrub them down and if anything is dried on I'll use like the Rough Side of a sponge and even my thumbnails you hear about people using a plastic scraper. A lot of times. I use my thumb nail. I probably said that before on the show, but I have real nails and I use them.	1.0
So anyway, Get those dishes done. I'll give you a little bit of time to do that. And then of course on most days well every day. You want to wipe your stovetop along with the countertops some days you want to remove the burners.	1.0
If you have that kind and clean inside those trays or you know, clean your burner Parts, depending on what kind of burners you have. If you have a gas stove you might be soaking your actual burners or even running them through the dishwasher. If you have an electric stove, you might occasionally remove the burners.	1.0
Clean that tray underneath kind of my trick if I have not been good about cleaning my burner trays and they've gotten discolored. You can buy new ones and replace them, but kind of my trick sometimes when I'm getting ready for company is I'll take those out and I'll cover them with aluminum foil and then put them back on, you know, you rinse them off first, but that way just that Blackness doesn't show so that's a little lazy shortcut for you if you're going to ready to have Me or something.	0.0
There are ways to get them clean but you know like with an oven cleaner and gloves or something, but I I'll typically either cover them in foil or occasionally by the new trays. I'm more likely to cover them in foil.	1.0
I have a new range right now.	1.0
So they're still really clean and I'm going to try to keep them clean, but I'm sure the day will come when I'm covering them in foil again in preparation for my mom to come visit her something. So, you know once they get discolored so yeah the stovetop though just around the burners you're wiping that every day and then the back control panel area. But on most days you're also going to want to wipe the front of your larger appliances, you know with some kind of a spray and a paper towel or maybe your microfiber cloth whatever you use is it's not important what you use but you'll want to wipe the front of your dishwasher your oven the outside of your refrigerator. Shredder just get rid of those fingerprints and whatnot front of your microwave and then a bonus chore if you have time and this is a day that you would go deeper would be to clean the inside of your microwave a lot of times when I'm hand washing dishes.	1.0
I'll pull out that glass turntable thing from the microwave and I'll wash that I think I have put that in the dishwasher that I typically wash it by hand, but I think either way would work. Cleaning inside the refrigerator.	1.0
I had one of the kids just take the food out and wipe off the shelves today. So that's something that you could do small appliances. A lot of times I like to give those a good scrub down.	1.0
Usually I wipe them down after I use them. But sometimes you're just on a roll wiping things down and you'll wipe down your small appliances to but remember when I talk about bonus chores in the kitchen, those are not for days when you're very overwhelmed. If you have just mountains of dishes, I don't care that there are what does it matter what I think but nobody's going to care if there are some	1.0
Prince or smudges on the front of your dishwasher or refrigerator, you know, it's not long as it's not like a blob of food, but just fingerprints and things that's not as pressing as doing the dishes.	0.0
So kind of the way my show works is you go deeper when you can if you're overwhelmed you do them bare minimums, which bare minimums in your kitchen would be washing the dishes wiping down the counter tops and stovetop.	1.0
Wiping down your kitchen table. If you have one sweeping the floor.	1.0
Okay. Those are those are kind of your minimums.	0.0
You might even be able to get away without you know with not sweeping if you either don't have kids or if you have a dog that's good at picking up after your kids. We typically need to sweep every day. We just do if you can't relate. I'm sorry, but that's an everyday thing.	0.0
So you'll want to do those bare minimums in the kitchen, but some days you only have a few dishes to do.	1.0
Or because you've been keeping up, you know, the better your daily habits are the quicker you can get to cleaning your surfaces because we spend so much time putting things where they go, you know as far as putting away dishes or washing dishes or you know, clearing clutter that type of stuff kind of eats into our time and then we don't have as much time to clean the actual surfaces.	1.0
So I'm not saying that cleaning surfaces is not important. I'm just helping you. Your time because if today you don't have time to clean your surfaces tomorrow, you probably will.	0.0
Especially if you tell yourself, I'm not going to do this to myself again. I'm not going to let the dishes pile up. I'm going to clean I'm going to do dishes after every meal and then tomorrow's going to be a mop day. You know that type of thing. So if you do get all of your dishes done, and you countertops wipe down the table wipe down maybe even the chairs wipe down if you have kids getting them sticky, then you're going to sweep or vacuum your floor in the kitchen, and then mop and mopping is not an everyday thing for me, but you know, it's probably a good thing to do at least once a week, and the frequency is going to depend on your family, you know, maybe you need to do it more or less often than that.	0.0
Maybe you just	1.0
Swan a spot clean I definitely spot clean my floor as I go if I feel something sticky I try to deal with that right away so that my floor doesn't just constantly need to be mopped.	1.0
It's something we do to sanitize it and shine it up but the sweeping and spot cleaning as you go goes a long way in allowing you to not you know and making it to where you don't have to mop every single day.	1.0
So I'm going to give you a little bit more time in the kitchen.	1.0
So that you can at least get to sweeping your floor.	1.0
While you're sweeping your floor or even mopping your floor. I'm going to talk about some possible bonus chores for those who are ahead of the game today organizing your pantry. I like to keep things organized by category like bake baking Goods side dishes, you know, like I would put flour baking soda baking powder.	1.0
Sugar I put those things together and then I have another section where I would have a light boxes of macaroni and cheese canned vegetables things like that, you know side dishes and then I have kind of a box a plastic box that I use for open packages, for example, like a bag of rice or bag of beans that's been opened that way if somebody picks it up wrong or something. It would spill into the box instead of just everywhere but kind of my system for that lately.	1.0
Is that every time I buy a package, this is a Frugal tip for you. Every time I buy a package of celery there's a the type of celery I get are not the ones that are already like conveniently cut up.	1.0
I'm talking just the cheap celery that's still kind of, you know, all together.	0.0
There is a really wide rubber band on that. Celery, so I keep that I put it in my junk drawer in the kitchen then if I buy things like beans and rice and bulk once I open that or brown sugar brown sugar.	1.0
It's not really in bulk. But you don't use the whole package at once by especially like for beans and rice.	0.0
In fact, sometimes the brown sugar I buy houses IP lock on it bag, so it's resealable. But with the beans and rice.	1.0
Usually not so I will take one of those free rubber bands that I got off the celery and put that around the rice bag or the bean bag after I use after I use some of it because everybody knows it's cheaper to get you know, big bag of pinto beans or big bag of white rice, but I still keep those in the Box just kind of out of habit. That's where I keep things that have been open just as a general rule. So those are just some ideas.	1.0
You might have fancy canisters lined up in a row and they're all labeled.	1.0
My pantry is not that perfect. But I do try to keep it neat and organized. So that's an idea of something that you can do in your kitchen already mentioned, you know, cleaning out the refrigerator and cleaning out the refrigerator can mean two different things some days.	0.0
You might not have time to wipe down the shelves, but you might want to just remove leftovers.	0.0
You know that you haven't eaten and they're no good anymore. You might want to remove those. So that's one way of cleaning out the refrigerator, you know, sometimes we have good intentions and by a lot of produce and don't eat at all. And you know, I have to get rid of that. Some of it can go to our pet bunny some of its got to go to the trash.	0.0
So clean out that refrigerator if you have time wiping down walls. Maybe you have a sliding glass door. In your kitchen area like I do I like to clean that inside and out when I'm ahead and my kitchen and I have time to go a little bit deeper just look around and see what needs to be done. Do you have clutter on top of your refrigerator or on top of your cabinets that you need to go through or relocate?	1.0
Have you swept out your pantry in a while? Okay.	1.0
What about sanitizing your sponge when you're done with the dishes you want to ring out that sponge you might want to just set it in the microwave for two minutes to sanitize it or you might want to make sure that you have a clean rag or a clean sponge or a clean dish towel for next time and set those things out. A lot of times if we have things set out for us in the kitchen.	1.0
We're more likely to do dishes and you know, then what then if we have to go looking for a rag or something for example a few years back.	1.0
I went through a phase of walking and then it kind of progressed into running and the way I was able to get up early and exercise was to lay out my clothes the night before and it doesn't seem like it would make a difference, but it did I'm	1.0
My shoes socks the outfit that I would be wearing I'd make sure there's a you know the right kind of pocket for my phone, you know, so that I could listen to music and keep track of my miles and all that type of stuff.	1.0
So I had certain clothing that I would wear and make sure you know, I had my earbuds ready and I would you know sports bra was definitely a requirement. I'd have all that stuff kind of laid out. So then when I'd wake up man, I really don't feel like running.	0.0
I'd look over and well, it's not going to be that hard to get dressed because I already know exactly what I'm wearing. You know, I put that on and then wash my face put my hair in a ponytail, you know didn't take much to get ready to just go out and Jog.	0.0
Well, sometimes it can be the same with cleaning.	1.0
If you have the cleaning products where you need them ahead of time and the supplies the towels or Rags the sponges everything there for the taking a lot of times.	1.0
It's easier to get started.	1.0
So just a thought I'd maybe preparing for tomorrow so that you can you know, like I was talking about clean as you go more and then maybe you'll have more time to deep clean surfaces, but Good for you pat yourself on the back if you had time to sweep and mop good for you. But if you just got your dishes done that's progress to let's move on to the next area.	1.0
Now. I may have mentioned earlier that you want to straighten that front entrance area at the beginning of A Clean cleaning session, but now it's time to go a little bit deeper as far as just cleaning all of your living areas. So in any living room or family room, you're probably going to want to straighten your couch cushions or throw pillows. Maybe you have DVDs video game controllers things of that nature that need to be placed where they go and then you probably are going to want to wipe off your coffee table and end tables you might have other destined to do but the areas where we actually eat and drink it.	1.0
At times need to be wiped down more frequently than just areas that maybe need to be dusted weekly.	1.0
So you probably want to wipe off those main tables in your living areas. And then of course pick up any clutter there could be clutter on the couches. Maybe there's a forgotten coffee mug on an end table may be there may be there are sweaters on the couch that	1.0
Have just tossed there. Maybe there are shoes on the floor that need to be relocated toys things of that nature.	1.0
So whatever it is, you'll want to pick up your floors.	1.0
You'll want to clear those horizontal surfaces in my living room.	1.0
A lot of times. I'll look at the top of my piano and see if there's anything up there.	1.0
That doesn't belong for example the other day there was a toy a up there. There are certain things that go up there like a plant framed pictures a key basket, but there's other things that shouldn't you know, glasses there certain things that I allow up there and then certain things that just don't belong up there. So just remove any clutter from your living areas clear off the surfaces and the floors and then of course lastly you're going to want to sweep or vacuum the floors and there. And that's probably going to take the most of your time but it also probably causes the most impact as far as how your house looks having clean floors in your living areas, whether they're vacuumed or swept and mopped can make a huge difference in the appearance of your home. It'll definitely give you that bang for your buck people will be able to tell that you've cleaned, you know vacuuming and dusting is a big thing. So, Most of your time might be on vacuuming or picking up the floors. Most of your time might be spent on that. But since I can talk faster than you can clean. I'll give you some ideas of bonus chores in those areas and perhaps it's a day that you don't need to sweep or vacuum. Maybe your floors already look good some things that you can do are additional dusting. Maybe you need a desk some knickknacks a bookcase a piano. Maybe you have a window to wash - or you know something really occasional like dusting the baseboards. I've talked about this before but an easy way to dust your baseboards is to rubber band a microfiber cloth around the bottom of a broom and then just rub those baseboards or if they have a lot of buildup you might need to use a wipe. Our sponge or something like that and actually, you know you something wet, but if you keep it dusted you can prevent it from getting to grimy other bonus chores in the kitchen living areas.	0.0
Look around to see if you have any spider webs might need to knock those down with your broom dusting the blinds.	1.0
Sometimes you need to just raise. Your blinds a little bit and wipe out your window sills because you don't want it to be dirty when somebody goes to raise the blinds. You don't want your window sills to get dirty. So make sure that you wipe those a lot of times. I do that. That's another thing. I do with a white you'll find that I'm kind of big on cleaning wipes, but you know any damp cloth would do the way I clean.	1.0
My TV is with a damp microfiber cloth just dampened with water.	1.0
So So, you know, don't forget to dust your entertainment center and all your electronics and whatnot. Maybe with even with a feather duster. However, you do things. You know, you usually want to try to dust before you vacuum or sweep. But let's face it your house probably isn't so dusty that if you've already swept or vacuumed your floor and then you wipe down the coffee table and end tables. It's not going to make much difference. Sometimes I do those things out of	1.0
Order even though I know that the proper way is to work from the top down and like I said most of your time and your living areas should be sweeping or vacuuming the floors. And the reason I say that is because there shouldn't be a lot of clutter and if there is no judgment here, but just a suggestion you might need some Storage Solutions.	0.0
Maybe you need a toy box in the corner. Because there are always toy spread out or maybe you need an ottoman that opens up or a coffee table that has a drawer some way to put things away.	1.0
Like for us our kids like to watch a YouTube channel on the big screen TV, that's about drawing. So we keep paper in a drawer in the coffee table because they do draw in that room.	1.0
So that's just one example of a storage solution.	1.0
And I definitely had that in mind when I got that coffee table. So and in the past, I've had Ottomans where you know something that it which is something you rest your feet on and you can open up the lid and store things inside of there.	1.0
And I've seen people store, you know have actually like a chest in the corner of a living room. Just depending on what you do in your living room, you know, you might need some place to store things.	1.0
But for the most part it should be about cleaning surfaces and I do have a minimalist approach, although right now, I feel like I don't have enough stuff in my living room because when I first decorated my living room when we moved in, Had put a small plant stand below a picture just to kind of balance out a certain wall and I put a plant there, but now I ended up moving that because people kept bumping bumping it and it was just kind of flimsy and then now they have something else set sitting on top of it. I think it's the modem or something like that and they have it moved over by the TV.	1.0
That little stand that I was using.	1.0
So I feel like I need some kind of a little shelf unit or bookcase below that picture with some books or knickknacks on it.	1.0
So that's something that I'm going to be getting when I can afford it.	1.0
So I I say a minimalist approach, but I'm not just telling you to have hardly anything in the room.	0.0
You need it to look nice and you need and some of your Decor does need to be three-dimensional, you know, it's not all just pictures on the walls, but for the most part that's I decorate pictures on the walls throw pillows, maybe a plant or a framed picture on a Surface but I don't mind having a few knickknacks. And like I said, I need something in that certain space just to kind of fill it and give the room a little bit more Dimension and balance but you know definitely have a minimalist approach though.	1.0
If you're having trouble keeping the room clean, you know.	0.0
If you have just a bookcase and small children that are just pulling books off the shelf or whatever, maybe move that bookcase to about bedroom. That's what we that's what we did at our old house. We had the bookcase out front and it became kind of a mess now. It's in a bedroom. The kids are older. They're not scattering the books as much but it's still just saves time when straightening the living room that you're not just worried. I'm not just worried about are these books You know lined up correctly or something. They can be a little bit in perfect. If they're just in a child's room as long as the child is happy with how they're organized. You see what I'm saying? So if there's a problem with clutter in your living room, you met our family room. You may want to consider downsizing as far as putting some things somewhere else and just keeping that room a little bit more sparse.	0.0
Those are kind of your living areas are your showcase rooms. That's where you Chain, so you want some Decor that represents you but at the same time you want to be able to there's that balance of wanting to be able to get it straightened up quickly.	1.0
Okay.	1.0
So those are just some thoughts there and another fun idea for a living area at one of my houses. I did not have very much counter space. So I set up a coffee station in the formal dining room, which was perfect because in that house when you first walked in your in a foyer area with a piano in a bookcase, that's when my kids would make a mess with the bookcase, but I hadn't really thought that through and it looked nice there.	0.0
So I just you know, that was just one of our chores was to organize.	1.0
Books, but to the right there was a formal dining room that you could see from the front door.	1.0
And then I have this chest which I kind of used as a buffet table or a sideboard I guess is the old term for it and you know in the drawers were coffee supplies and whatnot.	1.0
And then there was my Keurig. I also had a cappuccino maker up there. I had some decorative mugs. The you know a sign about coffee on the wall, you know, all that type of stuff.	1.0
So it was really nice for entertaining and Visually it just looked really welcoming you walk in my home and it's like there's a coffee station come on in and then you'd sit around the dining room table and drink coffee and it looked really pristine because we had another table in the kitchen where we actually ate on a regular basis.	1.0
So that's just an idea for you.	1.0
Maybe having a coffee station in your formal dining room. But at this house are Keurig is in the kitchen and then I guess the coffee station mentality is still there because I have a little sign about coffee and I keep some bugs and teas and sugar right above the Keurig. So it's still that concept of having everything right there where you need it to make coffee. But it's in the kitchen now, but consider having a coffee station somewhere else. You can get a lot of cute ideas for that on Pinterest. Hopefully you've had enough time to straighten up your living areas.	1.0
I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next area before before you start working in the next area though. You might want to get a drink of water. I'm parched right now, and I'm not even cleaning.	0.0
I guess it's Talking I'm doing.	1.0

I'm going to assume that you have one two or three bathrooms. So you can either do each step in each bathroom simultaneously and just kind of run back and forth or you can pick one bathroom to deep clean and then just lightly straighten up the remaining bathrooms, but I'm going to talk you through cleaning a bathroom and there are there are less variables with about The room with the kitchen. I'm like, I don't know if you have a dishwasher. I don't know how many dishes you have to do and things like that, but how we clean our bathrooms is pretty straightforward. So first thing I would do is walk in and see if there's any clutter on the floor laundry towels trash.	0.0
What have you I would pick up the floor if there's anything there bonus if there's nothing on your bathroom floor, maybe you don't have kids. Or they're older or well-disciplined. You know, I'd like to think my kids are well disciplined.	1.0
But anyway, pick up your bathroom floor next you would clear off the countertop of anything that doesn't belong and also the things that do belong meaning. Maybe there are some lotions on the counter that go in the cabinet underneath the sink, but your toothbrush holder and your toothbrushes Do go there you're going to clear everything off. So some things you're going to put them where they go other things that perpetually belong on the counter. You just going to set them aside.	1.0
Clear your counters.	1.0
Okay, next you're going to want to spray your mirrors with a glass or multi-surface cleaner and that same step. I also spray the faucets and then I wipe those down could be with a microfiber cloth. That's typically what I use. But if I'm in a hurry and I just walked in there with a roll of paper towels or something.	1.0
I might use that because sometimes if I find out somebody's coming over I'll want to go clean my guest bathroom mirror real quick. And if I use paper towels, so be it but typically I use a microfiber cloth.	1.0
You can also use newspaper or even an old t-shirt but wipe down the mirror and faucet area and then next I will apply some cleaning products to some key areas like and I'll tell you a product I use but use whatever product you want. I'll put some Scrubbing Bubbles in the sink and then output at toilet bowl cleaner. Be made by Lysol brand or something, whatever and I'll put that in the toilet bowl. If I don't have that dedicated toilet cleaner that has that neck.	1.0
I might just pour whatever cleaning product I have on hand into the toilet, maybe even a little bit of bleach because there's already water in there to kind of dilute that bleach.	1.0
So I'll pour something into the toilet bowl and then I will if it's a bathroom that has a bathtub. I'll spray the bath tub with the Scrubbing Bubbles.	1.0
Okay, next I will wipe down the bathroom countertop and then the sink by then that cleaning product has been in the sink for a couple minutes.	1.0
Now, sometimes I'm using a cleaning wipe and I'll just go ahead and use that in the sink as well and I'll wipe that out after wiping down the counter top. I'll throw that wipe away with a couple fresh wipes. I'll wipe the toilet seat. I'll lift it all white behind the seat. Then I'll wipe the rim everything that involves the area behind the hinges between the hinges all that throw those away and then I'll get a fresh wipe or wipes plural to wipe the flusher handle and then the back of the tank which can be kind of Dusty.	1.0
And then I'll also wipe around the exterior of the toilet bowl all the way to the base of it and even around the base on the floor. A lot of times. I'm using disinfecting wipes other times. I'm using some type of a cleaning spray and paper towels. I like to use disposable things. When I do the toilets. I don't really like the idea of clean the toilets with Rags, but that's okay if you do that.	1.0
Then I will clean out the bathtub now. I like to use a tool with a handle on it so that I don't have to bend as much and I will wipe out the bathtub and you know, rinse it out with that scrubber that has a handle on it and but I will say this. Sometimes I would keep a dish wand in the bathtub like the Scotch-Brite just one that has that receptacle in it.	1.0
I'll put half vinegar and half Dawn dish soap in there or whatever dish detergent. Does it really matter the brand I don't think and then you can actually clean the bathtub and shower while you're bathing or showering, you know, just white vinegar and a mild dish detergent dish soap.	1.0
So That's when idea but chances are you might have some build up?	1.0
So you might be using more of a bathroom product like Scrubbing Bubbles Commodore Ajax, and you know, you're wanting to scrub away that soap scum and that Brown Line that can develop around the bathtub or whatever.	1.0
So scrub that out wipe down the handle, you know, maybe you need to go a little bit deeper and actually clean the shelves the walls whatever you need to do if it's a	1.0
Dedicated shower with glass shower doors, you're going to want to use a glass cleaning spray and wipe those down inside and out. If you have a shower curtain, you might want to spray a just a shower cleaning product on the inside of the curtain to kind of keep it clean prevent mildew. Another more old-fashioned way would be just a bottle that has a little bit of like a bleach and water solution. But yeah, I would rather use like a shower spray that the smell isn't as harsh. It's more of a pleasant scent.	1.0
I don't spray the kids shower curtain that often because I use kind of a cheap one. And a lot of times we have it closed which allows it to air out. You know what I mean, when it's spread out that allows it to are out properly and then that tool that I mentioned about scrubbing the tub with I sometimes scrub the floor of the master shower and even the walls with that same tool.	0.0
So that's something that that you might want to do. That's another one of the Scotch-Brite tools, but it's got like a long handle on it. Does it matter the brand but I'm just Just giving you an example so, you know what to look for but there's it's I think it's called a shower scrubber. I've talked about it in a different episode. But if you don't have it, you know that small dish wand will also work. I just use a different dish wand and a bathroom than in the kitchen before I got my shower scrubber.	1.0
I would keep a dish want in the bathtub or shower and do that, which I decided I want to get more dish wands because I do like the idea of having one.	1.0
Each bathtub or shower so that we can kind of clean as we go and then when it's time to clean the bathrooms I say we I might be the only one that you well my husband would probably use that maybe I could train the kids on it.	1.0
Anyway, it makes cleaning session quicker if you're just maintaining your bathtub and showers.	1.0
So that's one possible idea and then	1.0
By now the stuff has been sitting in the toilet long enough that you would use a brush to scrub out your toilet bowl.	1.0
And then if you have any lines or discoloration, that's not coming off. You could use a pumice stone on that.	0.0
And of course you're going to wash your hands and it's not that terrible cleaning a toilet and if cleaning the toilet really grosses you out you might not be doing it often enough.	0.0
So and maybe you can wrap like a band. Down around your face so that you don't worry about something splashing up. Maybe you can wear gloves, you know, I don't really need necessarily need to do those things when I'm cleaning my own toilet, but it's just an idea but the more often you clean it, it won't be as gross of a job. Especially if people are just kind of using that toilet brush as needed and then I keep it soaking in a solution in a cleaning solution, you know in that holder so, you know, just whatever cleaning It usually kind of pour some in that holder and that makes your bathroom smell nice and keeps your toilet brush disinfected.	1.0
So some kind of a disinfectant liquid can go in there lastly remove any bathroom rugs and sweep the bathroom floor and dustpan it and then either mop the floor or maybe wipe it by hand with a disinfecting wipe.	1.0
And from time to time anyway, you're going to want to get on your hands and knees and scrub the baseboards and the bathrooms, but this might be a day that you just just sweep and that's it. Because remember you did wipe the floor right around the toilet, which is kind of the danger zone that you want to make sure to disinfect and maybe you also need to wipe your wall behind the toilet your baseboard behind the toilet. If you have little boys that are missing the toilet or big boys that are missing the toilet. It's not an issue here. But I still do you know wipe the floor around the toilet just in case of an accident.	0.0
So hopefully by now you've gotten at least your first bathroom clean.	1.0
If not, no worries keep plugging away at it, but it might be time to just lightly check your other bathroom.	1.0
Maybe you need to make sure there's toilet paper and clean towels maybe need to wipe a blob out of the sink toothpaste blob.	1.0
Maybe you want to just wipe down the very bottom of the mirror. Where they're a little bit of dental floss home run. So to speak little little dots that kind of hit your mirror. You want to wipe those off or maybe you want to just sanitized your toilets eat with a disinfecting wipes. And then use another wipe on the flesh or handle. Make sure you got like I said meant, you know enough paper towel or enough.	1.0
Toilet paper and stock clean towels hand soap, you know, maybe it's time to throw away some empty shampoo containers or old razors from a bathtub or shower but just straighten up a couple of your bathrooms that might not need to be deep cleaned.	0.0
If you have a couple more bathrooms, I have two bathrooms at my house. So sometimes I'll deep clean one and straighten another or sometimes. I'll deep clean them both. So I'll give you a few more moments to work in the bathroom while I talk about some possible bonus chores organizing under the sink.	1.0
I think is a big one. If you have a cupboard under the sink that area can get cluttered and you might just need to frankly you might just need to throw some stuff away.	1.0
You can't organize clutter. There might be some junk down there that you just never use. We really only need so many products. So it's good to simplify and admit to yourself when a product just didn't work out and you're not using it anymore and just don't buy it again, but you don't need to keep it for three or four years and then you know justify throwing it away at that point by how old it is. If you're not going to use it. Maybe pass it on to a friend or family member or just toss it depending on what it is.	0.0
So with a teenage daughter in the house, if a makeup product doesn't work out a lot of times I'll offer it to her and she'll be happy to take it. So definitely Purge any products that you're not using maybe you need to wipe down your bathroom decor. Maybe you need to wash the soap dish or the toothbrush holder.	0.0
And that in the dishwasher or something or get them soaking in your kitchen sink?	1.0
I know lately. I've been using bars of soap in the master bathroom. My husband and I each have our own sink were pretty much the only people that use those things. I mean occasionally akid might wash their hands their if they used our restroom, but for the most part I have my own sink, he has his own sake and then the kids share a bathroom. So I decided that we didn't really need to have a pump of hand soap in the bathroom and I might change on this later. But right now I keep just a bar of soap but it's sink and one of the reasons I like to do that is sometimes if I'm getting ready in a hurry and I'm not going to take a shower that morning.	1.0
I'm going to wait and take my shower in the evening.	1.0
I like to just pull my hair back and wash my face and I don't really wash my face with hand soap.	1.0
So I like to use a bar of soap in the bathroom that I can. So use on my face and then of course your guests want the soap to come from a pump. So in the kids bathroom / guest bathroom, you know, it's a hand soap pump and sometimes there's also a bar there if you know one of the kids wash their face in the sink, but for the most part they do that in the shower. So I tend to wash my face in the sink on some mornings. So I like to have that there and my husband doesn't seem to mind using a bar of soap in his sink either and I feel like it's a little bit cheaper. So when I mentioned soap dishes that's more in the master bathroom, or maybe it's for someone in your hall bathroom to wash their face with but I do recommend having a pump for guests to wash their hands with when they use the restroom.	1.0
So that's all I have to say about bathrooms today.	1.0
Let's move on to a bedroom that you're responsible for.	1.0
Go ahead and make your bed. Maybe it's a day that you need to change your sheets, or maybe you just need to take 60 seconds and just make the bed but making your bed makes such a huge difference.	1.0
Even if your room isn't completely tidied up or whatever. Just making the bed makes a big difference and a lot of times that's kind of the springboard to get your room clean. Once you see your med Bay, once you see your bed made it leads to other cleaning. Like putting clothes in the hamper putting shoes away clearing clutter from the nightstands. And then of course the bonus chores in a bedroom or just like the living areas. Maybe you need to clean a sliding glass door or wipe down a windowsill. Maybe you need to remove clutter. I often need to remove clutter from our bedroom dresser. We tend to accumulate stuff. So from time to time, I need to put those items away where they go. I think everybody has a surface in their house that attracts clutter. For me one of them is definitely the kitchen island is one and then the master dresser is one.	0.0
Get your bedroom picked up and maybe even vacuumed and swept. I know my husband appreciates a vacuumed bedroom so that I try to I'm trying to do that more often than I do because I definitely come in make the bed and clear the nightstands when I have my regular cleaning session and put clothes in the hamper, but I don't always vacuum and I think vacuuming forces may not to have a clue.	1.0
around the edges of the room and to see things that I might just not notice otherwise Okay, so, you know just around them box up against a wall or boots that haven't been put away in a week or whatever that type of stuff gets dealt with to prepare for vacuuming.	1.0
So sometimes you need to vacuum or sweeper room just to kind of force yourself to look at it in a different way and get it vacuum ready.	1.0
So to speak and just really clear away that clutter don't store things around the edges of your Out and that's kind of a weak area for me. I think in the master bedroom, you know, I would never do that in the living room.	0.0
But sometimes I do that in the master bedroom and then you know, maybe you need to delegate some chores in your kid's room.	1.0
Or maybe you have time to work in a kid's room today. Like if you if you keep your master bedroom just really clean and your bed was made a sec the second you got out of it. Maybe you can be working in a child's room or an elderly parents room, but a lot of times after I make my bed, I will fold a load of clean laundry on my bed, and then I'll have people come pick up their piles so to speak so	1.0
Let's talk a little bit about clutter in the bedroom. I think I think some people will be able to relate to this.	1.0
My bedroom is where I folded and put away laundry because I don't want to be the person that has a pile of laundry on the couch.	1.0
Obviously that's you know, the front room on my house and at houses where I had a separate family room. I was more likely to kind of have a little laundry Pile in the corner if that wasn't the front room, but when it's the front room you can't have that. Then you've got a laundry Pile in your bedroom.	1.0
Unless you're really good about folding stuff as it comes out of the dryer, but I keep falling on and off of that wagon. Like I said, I've been sick.	0.0
Okay, so sometimes when I fold and put away all my clothes, it can be frustrating when there is not room in my drawers for the clothing. So and I don't know if this is going to be relatable for many of you are not but sometimes I need to go through my Roars and hang some things up to make room for things that I want to keep in the drawers because I have more room in my closet than I do in my dresser and I don't want to get another dresser dressers are expensive and I already have a couple plastic units with drawers like one of them is in my master closet.	0.0
So I've already gotten all the drawers that I feel I should have and I need to just, you know, see my limitations withdrawal. space not create more space so	0.0
What I would do, for example, I have a couple of sports bras that I've only worn a few times. I never wear them.	1.0
I would only put them on if I decided to run which I haven't been into running in a long time, but there's always a chance I could decide to start to take up running so I don't want to get rid of them, but I'm tired of seeing those in my drawer taking up space.	0.0
So I actually put them on a hanger and put them and they're cute ones like there's	1.0
Bright pink one a bright yellow and so it's not like something I wouldn't want to hang in my closet.	0.0
I hung them kind of in and out of sight corner of my closet where I put my offseason clothing like my summer clothes because I do have I talked about wearing short sleeve shirts.	1.0
I think I mentioned that all the time but I there are certain things that are just summer outfits that I do kind of put off into the corner of the closet.	1.0
So I hung those in the closet because I really need to	1.0
maximize drawer space and then I realized I was storing some framed decorations that were just things that you know, I got in at thrift stores or whatever that I wasn't using at my current house and I thought you know what I'm just going to I'm just going to get rid of these because they're taking up space in one of my clothing drawers and they probably been in there since we moved so sometimes I have to thin down my drawers and part of it is hanging things up or I found a sweater that should be hanging up.	0.0
You know because you need drawers for things like socks underwear.	1.0
So sometimes you need to hang the other stuff up, especially if you have more space in your closet, then you do in your drawers. So that's just an idea for your bedroom. Maybe hang up more of your stuff and I do like to have just casual t-shirts and things in drawers, but things that I hardly ever wear like sports bras didn't need to be taking up space. I felt like they were taking up.	0.0
Much space hopefully you got a lot done during this cleaning session. One last area that I don't always mention would be like a laundry room. You might not even have a dedicated laundry room. But from time to time, I like to take a cleaning wipe or damp Rag and wipe down the washer and dryer the top of it and then you know kind of as you open the lid those areas around the edges there.	0.0
Sometimes you need to sweep around your washer and dryer throw away your lint collection or your empty detergent containers, and then don't forget. To do something outside today. Maybe you need to sweep your back patio or your front porch. Remember your house will be cleaner if you sweep the exterior entrances of your home, and then use welcome mats inside and out, but maybe you need to pull some weeds or you know, pick up some clutter from your yard the sunshine will do you good. Thanks for listening. And as always happy cleaning.	1.0
Dust is settled. Everyone's flights have landed and those that didn't have Wi-Fi were able to survive at least those that company begins their back home sick flee and now I can think about more important things. Like what is the top prospect list of the Dodgers look like Beyond some of the rumors we've already heard. It's the cell because God cast intjs just be he is Zack Meisel. What's up, my friend you? No Wi-fi part 2.	1.0
Yeah, this one was. Not as dramatic, I guess though. I did want to share. You know, I'm flying back from San Diego on Thursday and like they announced right before takeoff that there would be no Wi-Fi and I'm like, here we go again, like let me put out to the world that I'm not going to have Wi-Fi for the next handful of hours just so that when they inevitably trade Francisco Lindor and I'm just silent and not doing any reporting. It's not my fault and then I realized about I don't know. Most of the way into the flight that United has that they have that I message option. So you turn on their Wi-Fi and you of iMessage so I had nothing else but I had iMessage so I turned it on and you and some other people have texted me. You just said Bill Dance and Eddie a statue and I'm like, oh my God, they traded Linder and they got a hall from the Dodgers like and this is seriously happening happening now, and I texted you back and I said, All right, I think well it was in the Chicago. So I had a layover in Chicago. So it was on the Chicago part of the flight and you know that flights like 45 minutes. Yeah, and I think I had 25 minutes left in the flight and I'm like do I need to pay the 1099 for Wi-Fi for the you know, even though I'm gonna have to put away my laptop in 10 minutes and you're like no calm down. It's some knucklehead who covers the Falcons on the radio who comes out with this room, but I was pretty panicked there for a couple of Minutes and I thought we were going to have a legitimate part 2 to the annual tradition of not having Wi-Fi in a cross-country flight after the winter meetings.	1.0
Yeah, something about airplanes in the Indians getting stuff done. It was a few years ago trying to hammer out a contract with Santana last year actually acquiring Santana back this year. It could have been blind or but the six exclamation points were only matched or the six question marks. You sent me were only matched by the 600 was that you receive back in your text with the quote-unquote Rival executive.	1.0
Yeah, and I mean, I it's not like I reached out to say hey, like what do you think about this offer? Because I would not you know take that seriously, but someone had texted me and had that response and I was like, I can't not share this because Twitter was going crazy people were believing this guy for some reason and so we put that to bed. Well Oliver. Well, I want to see the one thing that didn't dawn on. till now that would have you know, I never needed to panic because I scheduled a really early morning flight back and with the stopped at Chicago because I assumed that's the flight that the Indians front office Executives would take turns out they took a later flight closer to lunchtime. So they were in the air when all that was going down and when you had texted me and so I don't know why I panicked because I think they're means would have been pretty limited engaged in quote unquote serious talks as aunt.	1.0
He pushed his chair back a little bit and got kicked six times by the infant behind him and chernov is trying to order seeing if the if Sprite falls under the free part of the in-flight service or if he yeah.	1.0
Yeah, it was probably first the first trade ever completed while one GM had a stroopwafel in their mouth.	1.0
I don't know if that's factual or not. So I'm going to have to back it up with a second source, and of course. It's the only thing those rumors really successfully did was raise the bar to an unobtainable level for the enhancing these Lindor Terry Scott sessions. So now anything that's not a complete highway robbery by the tribe, which the rumors that were out there. Absolutely were you and I have talked in this podcast that we don't know if the Dodgers straight up would do Lindor for Lux and if that was presented to you or I I think I would very strongly consider accepting that offer if I'm the Indians. Yet the offer was Luxe plus six other seven other nine other guys that were really really talented. So and in really nice lot money, of course and really didn't pass the smell test, but it did make for a fun at least 20 minutes or so of taunting you and whether or not I was actually being factual or not because I sent you the tweet and the Tweet went along with the build antonetti a statue Now text which if you receive both you Have understood my sarcasm, but when you didn't get the Tweet part of the text because you're in the air you only got the text message. So then that's initially all you get and then what I what I sent back was another picture. I think I screenshot of the tweet and try to send it to you that way but that also didn't go through and then I said something else which could have been interpreted as they just made this fantastic trade. So I am glad that I at least cause you at least some mild Panic while you're in there.	0.0
Thanks Jay. Couple of years off my life, but the craziest part to me was that there were some fans some Indians fans who were saying still probably not enough. I'm like, what are you expecting? I do think we need a little bit of a reality check when it comes to what fair trade offers would be. I think like I mean, I think the Dodgers are struggling to come to terms with the idea of even including Gavin Luxe by himself. Like that's it. Yet you're having people saying like Lux plus May plus Verdugo. I would definitely need all three of them and then it probably want like another piece or and it's like that's not how this works and teams treasure young controllable cheap Talent more than ever. And guess what the Dodgers have a really really smart front office. So yes, Dave you think you're sick of the Indians winning 90 plus games every year and not doing anything about it. Dodgers fans are so sick of the Dodgers winning. Seven straight NOS titles and having nothing to show for it with a massive payroll and robust farm system, but still their teams are disciplined and the Dodgers have a really good front office and they're not just going to throw everything at the wall to get Lindor for two years and maybe they could reassign them. But, you know teams just don't do that. I think it used to be a lot easier to pull off this sort of trade because there are there were more dumb front offices. I don't think I think there's only a couple of now and those teams probably are pretty bad. So you're not going to be dealing with them in this situation.	0.0
So need gets it gets really dangerous when the smart teams are also the rich teams like the Yankees who have been so very disciplined over the past several years fans screaming go back to the days of old when you threw money at everybody and that's not the way they had operated for the past several years until this offseason and when the perfect storm for them got laid at their feet they needed in a starter Gerrit Cole is Guy that just doesn't seem like he has any alarming issues tied to him at least at the moment. I know that's knock on wood for any pitcher, but there's a reason why he got the money he did and pretty much everybody agrees that he's probably worth it. And so it became a layout for them to be able to get it done. But in the past they have been operated like the Yankees. We used to see in the before the mm rolled around and they were winning world. Oops year after year after year, it's been a little bit of a different dynamic in that front office. And they the Dodgers are sort of a similar team we talked about this when we initially started talking Lindor rumors at the beginning of the offseason and I said one of the things that I think will be interesting is how desperate to these teams get where you've been operating this way like the Dodgers have where you have the strong farm system. You already have a really deep talented roster. You probably don't need to do a lot but are the fans starting to get it to you. There are Upset is just winning the division every single year and hoping that you the two random randomness your way into winning a world title. Are they going to be happy with that or are they going to feel some pressure and that was always something in the back of my mind that that thought. I thought maybe that was something that could help push or escalate a trade of Lindor to a situation like LA because if they're just evaluating this based on spreadsheets and surplus-value. Value years of control cheap control at that guy's that allow them to spend more money on other parts of their roster through free agency. If they would like to the one thing was going to change that was that sense of desperation and needing to change the the way they've gone about things in the past several years and we'll see because They didn't come away with that that major free agent peace or trade piece as of yet. So are they going to feel that sense of desperation as this winter unfolds? I don't know but that was the one thing that was kind of a wild card in my line for getting these these sorts of this sort of trade done.	1.0
Right and the Indians could prey on that because they could just say well we'll keep them. He's a perennial All-Star will keep him for two years. We don't have to trade him to you but along those lines I'm also Thinking it's only a matter of time before another team gets in the mix or is leaked to be in the mix because that just drives it up even more. You know, if the Dodgers insist they don't want to include Gavin Lux. Well, then the Indians can leak to someone and say hey we've talked to the Atlanta Braves or the Cincinnati Reds or another team about a Lindor trade and and then maybe the Dodgers get a little more desperate. But you know, I also think having just I'm Just going to completely debunk everything. I just said I also think front office's don't fall for that stuff the way we all do media fans the public, you know, I think they have a pretty good grasp of what's really going on. And yes, they do pay attention to trade rumors and and National reporters and whatnot. But you know that they use that to check on things to get what the legitimate scoop is and not necessarily what's out there. So it's going to be interesting. You're right. You know how desperate to the Dodgers get do they really feel like Gavin Lux can be as good as Francisco Lindor and more importantly do they feel like he can be as good as Lindor right now. I don't know but I mean you look up and down that roster and there's like 15 to 20 guys. I'd have interest in if I was if I were the Indians, I mean, there are so many directions they could go but you probably need Lux in the deal to feel comfortable because this isn't just this isn't just like Find the best match and let's do it. This is overwhelm us enough that we feel comfortable going to ownership and convincing them to sell their franchise face of the franchise and you know, probably sacrifice some season ticket sales and some fan sentiment knowing that hey you might be a better team and you'll certainly be a better team long-term Beyond 20/20 one. But like this is going to sting even if you get a really good return even if you quote unquote win the The trade and all the people who love to get a handout letter grades 10 seconds after a trade happens for some reason, you know, you're even if you win those and you get an A-Plus like it's still going to hurt at the Ballpark at in the ticket office. So you're going to have to be overwhelmed. That's why I think Lux probably has to be in the deal no matter what even if you to a mean like in a vacuum like Dustin may + Alex Verdugo + Chris Taylor plus Joc Pederson Plus Like Max Muncie is an amazing Hall. But like I still think I still think it's got to be Luxe. I still think you need that Marquee slam-dunk piece. And I think especially Indians fans by now are probably saying it's got to be Luxor.	1.0
We're not going to be happy Indians fans Indians for an office to I would venture to say that that's probably the takeaway that they have if they want to go draft day. They put a note in their pocket and it says Gavin Lux or nothing walk away and so I I have a certain faith in their ability in these negotiations to be able to walk away because we've seen in the past they They stick to their guns on this this sort of thing. They very rarely will meet you too far in the middle. They'll make trades. They think are fair and I don't know if they're necessarily trying to go out there and and Rob anybody but they have in their mind what they think is fair value in return for their guys. And if you're not willing to match it unless it's a situation where they're losing the player at the end of the year or the player doesn't really factor into their plans. They're prepared to just say no. Thanks and keeping Francisco. Lindor is one hell of a Secondary prize and I could argue is probably the first prize but as you've laid out before you've written we've discussed in this podcast the last week. If you do hold on to them, then you better you better make that worth it. You need to make that move count for something because once once you pass this winner and you the season starts to me, it's like a car driving on a brand new car driving off the lot the minute it does that the value has declined a bunch and lens or anything. Your cars, no kidding the luck. I have and Lindor is a I mean you're already starting with the value that is through the roof. So even if you're treating him for one year, you would give back something useful, but you're not going to get back. Somebody's top prospect like Gavin Lux, that's not happening. If you trade him. I think if you go through the end of this offseason and you hold on to him you can wave goodbye to anyone getting anyone close to that level.	0.0
yeah and weeks we've said it when you record three podcasts and week, I guess you can send a repeat yourselves, but it's I think you trade them now or you don't trade him at all and What makes this tricky is that you probably have definitely have multiple contingency plans. But you have to act on it that this offseason is certainly moving more quickly than the last few have and like if your end if you end up keeping Lindor, well, okay, then you got to go find your second baseman. You got to see if you can add to the Outfield. You got to see if there's a starting pitcher you want to move to get some offense if help do you need to supplement the bullpen if you trade Lindor Maybe He says you get back influence how you do part 2 if you don't trade Lindor you obviously have a plan for part two, but like at what point do you just move on and do decide? Okay talks are done. We're keeping them and we're going to go set our sights on all these other things we have to do and maybe once you start doing all those things it complicates the Lindor talks if the Dodgers end up getting desperate in mid-January and her like we got to do this we've missed out on too many guys.	1.0
Yeah. I mean you said it before this impact. Every single thing they do for the rest of this winter and knocking it out now would be an advantageous because then you can start to set up what your team looks like without him. But if you hold on to him now and you start to make moves that is in anticipation of what a roster looks like with Francisco Lindor and then the trade comes you probably still make it but it's going to be a lot more difficult trying to make that audible on the Fly and then it becomes even more interesting as these trade talks unfold as you're sitting there and as a front office you think you're Maybe You're starting to make some progress and then the the other side of the table says yeah, we're sorta into it. But you know what we might need a guy like Mike Clevenger coming back.	1.0
Yeah, so, I mean that's how a name gets tossed out there. I don't know the veracity of the report that was was out there. I mean if you look at the facts. If you traded Lindor and Clevenger separately you get so much more than if you treated them together, you could find a team desperate for starting pitching trade them Clevenger and get a top prospect. And then some you trade Lindor and Clevenger together and it's like yeah, you're gonna get a huge haul but you could get a huge haul for both of them separately. I think the the more realistic thing first of all as I've said they're going to go to Clevenger and Bieber at some point in the next month or two and say let's talk Extension. I think there's a better chance Beaver signs agrees to something then Clevenger does but as we said like Clevenger was a late bloomer. He's about to be 29 years old. It's going to hit free agency at about 30 right before his 32nd birthday. I don't know if it seems going to give you that. They're not going to give you the Gerrit Cole Stephen Strasburg type deal at that age. So it's and you gotta prove yourself in the next three years. So it's a little riskier. So maybe he signs. Maybe he doesn't if he doesn't And I think he does become a logical trade candidate a year from now not the type of thing where like Trevor Bauer where they really wanted to get rid of them. But you explore just like they have with tons of other guys, but I don't think it makes much sense to trade him. Now. I don't think it makes any sense to include him in a Lindor deal to sweeten the pot. I think you could dangle kluber in that package certainly maybe a younger picture. But yeah, I think you keep them separate and then During Bieber or the reason why you feel like whether you trade Linda or not, you're still going to contend and be a threat to win the division and make some noise in the playoffs.	1.0
I was just trying to look I try to remember when Max Scherzer signed his deal because in my mind, I was thinking it with with the Tigers. He didn't truly become really special until late into into his Tigers career who's kind of League average me a little bit better picture up until but very durable very durable true and that was part of Of his Allure, especially when he really took off in 2013. That was his first 200 Innings season. He puts it together another one with the Tigers in 2014. So he had put together back-to-back season was where he looked like a front of the rotation guy at 200 Innings, but he had done that at the age of 29. So he and his free agency entering his age 30 season. That's a lot different than another 2 years beyond that I'm saying for Clevenger. Maybe maybe he builds himself up to to that. sort of level consistent But as you said you would be risking it more as a team at the age of 32 and there are already people that were a little bit nervous I guess is the best way I can put it about the deal that Scherzer sign with the Nationals. And again, he did that entering his age 30 season. So that's a little bit of a different situation but that was a little bit surprising that to me sounded like the Indians rolling through all these names in the Dodger said, oh well, if you're going to roll through all these guys that you like we also would like to make a Of it at Clevenger and then the Indians being the Indians a team that is just there not going to hang up or in this case walk out the door. Just based on you bringing up a name. They'll say okay. Let's talk Clevenger. This is what are realistic thought is on him and they would discuss him and even by the Indians entertaining it just to say we would expect you to give up this completely unobtainable amount of talent in return for Clevenger. You've now quote unquote discussed it. No, I'm not we're not we're not sitting in there. I don't know how as you said I don't know how aggressive these talks actually work. But to me discussing it means that the Indians entertain almost anything and if the fact is that they spent four or five minutes talking about it. They have already discussed it and then at that point leaking that sort of report is factual you did discuss adding my Clevenger to it, but it was completely and totally off the table in terms of reality. That's just the way that I interpret it well and they always	0.0
Cincinnati loves to tease us and torment us and say we would never believe half the shit that they actually discuss and that doesn't mean they want to do it. It's just I mean, I we always bring in hbd but it's it is legitimate like it's in some ways reflects real life where it's like if someone tells me they have interest in my star player. I have no interest in moving that player but I'm going to say, okay. What do you want to give me? What do you got just to see because you know Never know and it could help you down the line when you want to reconnect to actually make that trade when you're more willing to move that player.	1.0
So and is it a useful just to know what other teams think of of your guys hours it helps it all and that's what the winter meetings are.	1.0
It's just about it's about until it's just about Gathering as much as you possibly can you're Under One Roof. You can't leave your sweet or else you get swarmed by crazy people in the lobby. And so you just sit up there and you talk about different scenarios with your fellow front office members and you You talk to other teams and see what they're doing you talk to agents to see what other teams are doing. So that's what this is. And and I also think I mean, it's crazy. I'll and I know fans this is this is a different situation like last year. I think fans grew tired of the kluber Bauer stuff because it just seemed like it was a different report every day and then nothing ever happened. This is different. This is the face of your franchise. This is a franchise shifting decision one way or the other. You're setting yourself up for the next decade one way or the other so I get it. But also like I landed yesterday there were a couple like vague reports and a specific report from someone who's probably never even been to an Indian's game and like everyone's panicking and saying I bet something's going to happen in the next five ten minutes or like we're getting close where there's smoke there's fire and it's like don't be surprised if this lingers I mean this is yeah. This is not the sort of thing that just gets hashed out in one. Dinger one phone call over an hour like this is this is a lot of back and forth between two smart front offices. And again, like even if the if the Dodgers are like will give you Lux and we'll give you may and you give us kluber and Lindor and the Indians are like, we really like this deal like this is this is definitely what we need to do. They still should go and talk to other teams and be like, can you top this like this is going to take a while and I think there are a lot of keep saying hurdles are off. Pickles but there's just a lot of things that you have to check off before you make a trade like this and I won't believe it until incarcerated.	1.0
Bob has it.	1.0
What did he did he tweet something this week and you were trying to tell me that was legit.	1.0
This week. No, I don't remember this week. I see I am such a fan of the more rumors the better because I can process it. I can I can sift through them and take away from what is reality and what maybe fiction and what is just being put out there and what actually has legs. So if anyone wants to go through the ESPN trade machine and fire up some fake trade that they came up with. I love it. I want to digest it. I just Love trade discussion. I love thinking about what players are worth and rumors are fun. So incarcerated Bob whether he's on he's nailing a rumor or completely off base. I love it. Nonetheless. So nobody can we also say I mean, I've seen the train he had that he had the Swisher news back in 2013, man. Marries Bushman. He's got the receipts.	0.0
Well, I wish when he loved down and out when he found it out ahead of time. I'm he should have tried to put a stop to it. I do want to say something about the trade machine though. I mean it's it is interesting. So Paul horns was was asking Chris Hansen Eddie about kind of the mechanics of Trades and how they decide what a player's value is and God bless onesie because that's not something you can answer simply in a 30-second reply or but you know the teams they basically assigned a dollar value to every player in every system and it's You know, you're not trying to match up. You're just trying to get an idea for what a player is worth might be over the Long Haul and the thing is is Linus has woken up from a slumber. The thing is like when you're trying to find a match for an Indian's Dodgers trade. It's not going to be even the team that's taking on the younger less proven players is the team that needs to have that higher number because there's more risk involved, you know, so you're not trying to trade Lindor if he's valued at 80 million and you're not trying to trade him for 80 million dollars of surplus of value of prospects. You got to get more back. And so that's that's I think that's one error.	1.0
I keep seeing people who love the trade machine and you can hear Linus who really is sick of reading about fake traits to and there are people inside organizations no names, please that all they do is sit there and try to dream up trades for people that are higher up try to find that fair value and target people. That's all they do all day long.	1.0
Anyway, that's that. I wish I had that job.	1.0
That's what I do in HPD all freaking dead. I do want to Pat myself on the back for one thing though. I did mention that I thought the Angels would make a lot of sense for Corey kluber and then like three hours later. There was actual smoke on that so good job TJ, putting that together anybody with a third grade education could have match those two, but I did it on the podcast and then it became reality.	1.0
Yeah, they make sense for the Angels. Love that pairing makes as much sense for the Indians. I think the Angels would probably have to overpay just based on. Their system. It's such a weird. It's a weird thing anyway, because as we've talked about so many times like Obviously kluber does not have Peak trade value right now, you know, you're better off waiting six months or taking a time machine to go back a year or a year and a half. So you're asking a team to take on the contract and I know we've said like the contract is fine. As long as he turns out to be even an adequate picture but no one knows what he's going to be and so it's like you somehow still have to convince a team to give you a really useful piece. Otherwise, it makes more sense to just hold them. And the angels are weird team because they're so top-heavy and their farm system is a lot better than it was a few years ago. When it looks like Mike Trout was just gonna waste away like Tom Hanks in Castaway with Albert Pujols as Wilson, but it's I just made a movie reference like we hate document this podcast, but I think my name is void dumbass. That's that's a good reference. It's just it's going to be interesting to see what they eventually do with him because Because I think it's it's difficult to find if you're going to trade him. Now, then you some team is has to get desperate and I almost think the opposite of the Clevenger thing think of me more sense if the Dodgers liked kluber and believed in him just param with Linda or and see if that'll make a difference.	1.0
Yeah, when all those names started dropping it was just spitting out. Hey this guy and this guy and this guy I'm thinking for Linda or yeah, but they're also trying to give them kluber and something else you miss it half the trade on the Indian side, I would imagine We just spitting out locks and made this catching Prospect and this infielder and that outfielder in this pit. That's what this is from an Indian's perspective where you and I are thinking about this. How can the Indians win every trade? Even you and I are going. All right. Hold on.	1.0
It's a this is a completely unfair. We need to step in here.	0.0
This is not fair to the Dodgers if they pull off a smooth flow. So as I said, if nothing else, it's raise the bar to a level. That when if and when they actually do trade lend or it will look nothing like this trade and so everyone is going to be pissed off they're going to be pissed off regardless, but they're really going to be taste.	0.0
Yeah, the only time I'm trying to think of I feel like we usually say immediately when the Indians make a trade that they got the better end of it. Don't we like I mean, I think the night that Trevor Bauer got traded it was like we found out one named after another and it was because at first it was like think we do we try to remember the order because I was going all around the room trying to get Intel from players is they heard from people or Get you know, you get a text from a front office person at one point or a an Asian and and it's like you slowly pieced this together and each piece. It was like, oh my God, this is like better and better. It's unbelievable. I feel like most of the Indians trades your immediate takeaway is they got the better end. Like I remember like the Eric Gonzalez trade and who knows how that will end up it was said like a three four. Three or three four two. Yeah, and obviously Max Mara was a bust but like Jordan loop low looks like he's going to absolutely destroy left-handed pitching and maybe more and they have them for a long time and are cazalas every time he played on the field last year. He injured one of his teammates. So that looks like it's immediately that seemed like a decent trade because Lupo had a pretty good minor league pedigree. The only one that didn't was was the on Gomes trade and we all look foolish now, Your Roberto Perez had and seeing what Daniel Johnson could do. So I feel like they always seem to win trades immediately. And I mean like obviously long-term. They do Francisco. Mejia hasn't done anything and the Padres have like been in the market for catching. I hope so. It's just it's going to be interesting to see what that sentiment is. Like if they end up trading Lindor who is everybody's favorite player and clearly the best player and on the roster Like fans allow themselves to say man. It sucks losing Lindor, but holy shit.	1.0
What Hall they got ya can't both things be true. Yeah. That was all there was a little bit true in the bower aspect. It's like, oh man. Well, you lost the front of the rotation arm that you would have had next year. But look at everything you got so have the Indians won every single trade. I don't know. Did they win the trade? Did they win the trade when they In his dribble Cabrera to the Nationals for Zach Walters.	1.0
No, but I also I mean guys who are two months from free agency and don't have much trade value. I don't put that on them. I will say the one other one that made you scratch your head at least was last year with trading ideas because I don't think people like that but that wasn't like especially at the time because people didn't really know about Jack Bauer's and he was a top under Prospect like that wasn't what I don't I cannot think of an example ample where they made a trade and it was like, oh my God, they get host. What are they doing? Like you usually have a pretty good feeling about the deal at the moment and it's going to be interesting because like the Dodgers of their their roster and their farm system are loaded. There's so much opportunity, but I don't know it's going to be if they don't include Lux. Is there a way for fans to be no?	0.0
No, probably in reality know if we're living in within the realm of things that can actually happen. Probably not and the in the IDS thing. I put more on ownership anyways, because I don't think the front office really wanted to trade you ideas. It was something that needed to happen money-wise to enable the Encarnacion Santana thing to happen. So I put that on ownership more than I put it on the front office Dolan's cheap, right? Mmm and stream Anna Santana did come back and have a hell of a year best year. He's ever had so Yeah, I guess we'll see. We'll see what Johnny D's continues to become a we'll see if Jake Bowers ever puts it together. Certainly this time last year Bauer's look like a very interesting piece.	0.0
But now he's a guy that we don't even talk about on this podcast and Ian DT is could be your third baseman with Jose at second base Tony for work.	1.0
He still needs to work on that defense.

Hi, this is Mary HK, Troy and you're listening to Hey, cool life a micro pot about mental health and creativity. Hmm. It is January the 23rd 2019 and this is episode 22 in reality. It is actually the evening of the 22nd. But um I'm a very early morning tomorrow. So I am trying to record it tonight and seeing how it goes. I've already done that thing where I fussed too much and premeditated too much. So I've tried recording it once before and I didn't like the results and I was having this Stern conversation with myself being like the whole agreement was that you Just deliver the first Pancake no matter how misshapen and raw the dough but then the sort of staunch like determination with which I refuse to let myself even like mess with it felt really ungentle.	0.0
Like I was like this seems really harsh.	0.0
So I'm allowing myself to record it again and see how it goes. So yeah, I I wanted to talk a little bit about friendship. You know, I am really selective about who I spend time with because you know, like I've been in recovery now from my eating disorder and like pretty much sober for about 8 months which is less than a human gestation period and it's still really new and it Really new and it takes a lot of work. And so I kind of treat myself with gentleness and acknowledge how much mental real estate this is occupying. It really beats being fully in the disease or in relapse, but you know, I do treat myself. not carefully or gingerly or with kid gloves or anything just with like, you know, just a little more tenderness than I have historically and so yeah, like I might not see a lot of people really often like I shared earlier about how I manage my day and how I only really take on two large chunks of activity a day because any more than that and I just get really anxious and	0.0
I start tripping out a lot, but I've been really noticing like who I spend time with and who I talk to and there are a lot more people that I talk to who I may not see that regularly Beyond people in like my 12-step meeting and they're all great and I really really go to them and they're such a source of like infrastructure when I just need another brain to Noodle on an issue with me.	0.0
me but I used to pride myself so much on being self-sufficient and I don't know like it's another one of those things where I just like felt like it was a thing that you should aspire to and should be successful at and now I'm not so so sure considering like how creative and like inventive and inaccurate my brain can be so I've been talking to a certain group of friends who are also like I would say like dealing with their own emotional homework and	1.0
you know, they're all writing away at their own owner's manuals and I love comparing notes and I love hearing how people are doing.	1.0
And so I started asking people. How are you and you know and a friend of mine who is very very that's say influential and has a massive massive social.	1.0
You're following once remarked after an international tour how infrequently people ask how she's doing and it how how all these responses like are so like responses on social media or even in person usually are so blithe and they're like positive assumptive. It's all like you're killing it you're crushing it. I want your life like you look this you look that you look great. You're you know, whatever.	1.0
And she's like, you know what? I never really get an invitation to speak or check in on how I am actually doing and I've personally found that like when my brain is overwhelmed and I'm anxious and I'm just like in that real not scribble. sometimes like asking someone else how they're doing is like a really great trick to get that light spot light off the inside of my own brain with like, you know that like and just shine a bit of attention on to something else like something outside of me and it's funny like if you ask someone how are you, you know with my friends and	0.0
It's like crew of people who like we said, we like talk about our emotions all the time. We like text about like, you know, just like to give each other affirmations and all that stuff and with them it's really different, but I wanted to talk a little bit about how to really ask how someone's doing because we're so unused to it and I certainly was really, you know, I was like a foal trying to walk. It was just all like you know, like shifting weight awkwardly like buckling under certain pressures and all this stuff and When you ask how someone's doing and they're like, oh, you know the same, you know, same same tired like everyone else and they move you along.	0.0
Sometimes I'll just ask like no really like what kind of day are you having and then just like people are better sometimes about talking about logistics and then like moving into how they feel about it and like a lot of times you can ask a follow-up question or like	1.0
Oh, yeah, like, you know an affirmation or recognition or like making space for it as an answer and be like, oh, wow, like, you know, like that sounds potentially overwhelming like how how do you feel about it? How are you doing about it?	1.0
And then, you know, then they can sort of talk about how they feel and and then like again because people are so in used to it.	1.0
I'll sometimes volunteer something to and then know that it's an invitation to ask how I'm doing and it's so basic and it's so pedestrian but you know, it's not going to be a new / that we increasingly don't talk to each other and interact in like ways to like really share data and really share truth and you know for me for a long time what helped is	1.0
so I just like convinced myself because for the longest time like I was just like why are people talking like I had no capacity for empathy and compassion and so I was always really confused by like when people would like share about themselves.	0.0
I'm like, why is what is this Deluge that I have unwittingly subscribe to but now I feel sort of like my my perspective has really changed on it because I've reaped so many benefits and sharing how I feel because I've	1.0
That articulating an issue makes the issue right sized and describing it makes it feel real ER and if I say something that I believe it helps me sort of like inspect it.	1.0
You know, it's kind of like when someone asks you to describe a new book and you can't describe it like really concisely and like three sentences you're like, whoa needs work problems are kind of like that too.	1.0
They just feel a lot more outsized if you don't let it out because you're convinced that your brain will somehow fix it.	0.0
Like that's where a lot of my anxiety comes from.	0.0
That's where a lot of the circular thinking and rumination comes from so sometimes I just let it out and it just makes it a lot. Better but yeah, so what I had to sort of assume like the first baby step I took in this entire Enterprise of like human decency and I city is that I just like pretended as if people cared about my response like I used to be the king of being like, oh, you know just fine Kelly and you know, whatever like tired or like.	1.0
Oh, yeah great non-roma. How about you and just like turn that around so quickly like Like like it's like a judo move. And now I just like really take that as a sign to check in and I just pretend that people care about my response no matter how sheepish I feel about it and how embarrassed I feel about it. And now I feel like it's like a sign of weakness which high like what is like, where did that come from?	1.0
And that helps you get started on talking about feelings with other? and then you'll sort of find out like who the people are who aren't total like energy black holes and like who aren't just like vampiric and then those are the places where you can go to like not like totally Workshop an issue, but like just get your mind off yourself because that's where I just get into a lot of trouble and then from there.	0.0
I'm at this point where now I'm like like effusive in a real way and I really like I'm flooded with gratitude and I tell all my friends that I love them and I really mean it and I don't even need MDMA to be coursing through my veins or anything like I'm just like wow like,	1.0
this is such a trip like we're all just doing our best and figuring things out at like a really Scribbly way and my thing it's like I forget everything I learn all the time. And so having people sort of bear witness to you and how you're doing and remember for you and you remembering for them and like everyone can like hold up a loving mirror and ask questions about why you believe the things you believe like Human beings are designed to need each other. And what's dope about that is it like once that need is met like it feels really good and it feels really safe and it feels really complete. And so even if you feel like a maniac especially if you're like a woman, especially if you are like a woman of color or you are just not like you're like average cishet, you know, like monoculture like mono conscious person who's like quote normal or a quote like skin-toned, you know, like yeah, like it's just a way to like take small defiant actions to like take up space and to like reaffirm your own agency, you know, not dump not like pollute not take advantage, but just like command that attention. Um and have and like amplifying other people and inviting them to do it to like, you know, I'm literally sitting here recording a mini pod on the floor about asking how are you like that's where I like that's the key to Wellness. Like it really really helps me and it's free. You know, so I hope you find some utility in that and I hope you have a gentle day and I hope you find small reassuring ways to accept the flavor of brain that you have in like hopefully grow to love it and appreciate it.	1.0

Thank you.	1.0
You're one game away man from State. How does it feel to be one game away?	1.0
The feelings kind of unexplainable. Like you had a pretty big game and against Wellington for receptions 161 yards 2 touchdowns. There are officers of London's great getting Braden Tom and him he does great getting the ball to us.	1.0
Earlier in the season man. You guys lost the Stratford. What do you think's going to make this team different from the team earlier in the season?	0.0
Earlier in the season we weren't really I guess you could say and we're going to come out more live and have more passion.	0.0
Who would you say is your biggest fan cutter?	1.0
my biggest fan probably my parents.	1.0
Are there any pregame rituals that you go through before you take the field like the parade? Do you go to the silent place?	1.0
And now up on the way to the games?	1.0
Hey, nothing like a pregame nap. Hey, I feel that I know Devon had told me that Austin it have some goals and devours a whole bag full of Max yeah, Roman Dennis	1.0
Who would you say has been your biggest mentor on the foot in football and football coach the exit coach Lucas does great on and off the field.	1.0
What do you think? It's going to take to be Stratford?	1.0
Coming out live and stopping them. We got to get stops.	1.0
Yeah, I think in the last game you guys had a lot of turnovers and I think if you guys can minimize the turnovers, I think you guys will be. All right. I think it's going to be a different team that they're facing and they they're not ready. I don't know if they're ready for this this live over Hamlin pod 540 because this team has seemed to come alive in the last second half of the season. People are comparing this team to the 1994 Hamlin's team. How does that make you feel? Because with that team being that what that team making it to the state semifinals as well. People are comparing those two teams. Does that how does that make you feel to think? They're comparing us to that t that same team?	1.0
It's pretty crazy how they compares to another team in the past. It was so good.	1.0
And how big how big of an honor is it for you guys to be the last big country team standing now?	1.0
It's kind of crazy because all eyes are gonna be on us and try to bring a state championship back to the big country.	1.0
I know a lot. I know a lot of people probably thought that Holly was going to win last week in that shocker with post. I went to that game in man that game was crazy. I was watching you all's game online at the same time that I was at that game trying to keep up with both games and it was crazy to think because I guess Holly thought they already had The bag and post kind of surprised on him. You guys have been blowing people out my playoffs like if these have been like big wins, like if you guys blow out Stratford, that's gonna be the craziest thing. I know it's gonna be a dogfight. I have a feeling and this game What do you want to say to the proper Nation? Who's gonna travel to playing boo on Thursday nights support the team?	1.0
Thanks for coming and we're going to get a win.	1.0
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and in this podcast. I'm going to let you give a shout out to whoever you want to give a shout-out to like whether your team your mom your dad the floors are yours cutter shout out to my parents and shout out to my sister and the cheerleaders. All right there you guys have it man cutter Martin from the Han Le pied Piper's. Thank you so much for being on Patriot port stock from Texas, sir.	1.0
Hello and welcome to the volunteer firefighter podcast where we listen in to a group of rural firefighters as they give their opinions on the challenges. They face both on and off the fire ground. We release a new episode every week. So please hit that subscribe button leave us a rating and share this with your fire family and friends now onto this week's episode. Where as always we ask the question. Are you DTF? Hello and welcome to the volunteer firefighter podcast. My name is Carl and tonight. I got pretty much an empty podcast room. I do have Scott. Oh Todd. Thanks getting the top and I have Scott. Hey and I are tan. Hello and yeah projects. Yes anymore. Is it is it true? And it's just you're here. There is a little bit of a break and we're going to have Kevin robbed, but I think careful was too. Tired and Rob go well, we are absolutely probably sent to Australia. So when we buy it for a while, but yeah, it's got some news a tractor-trailer.	1.0
Unfortunately, Robin Mexico watching the kids. I like Rob. Yeah, so Marshall bass drum Australia, he got back to us and send us a message to this mystery today with some updated numbers. So they're now at 2 million hectares of land burnt in their Wildfire season.	0.0
I don't know I sound insanely huge.	1.0
I'm not sure how big but you said no because that's really yeah.	0.0
He said in the message. I think he was he was on Mutual Aid tonight for a fire coming in from the south and then they were watching for a fire that was already coming in from the north. It's surrounded by fire.	0.0
So at least Yeah. Yeah, there's a Sting from New South Wales rural fire service that he sent us says 73 300 grass fires Burning Brightly burning 2 million hectares of land burnt 673 homes or have been destroyed 14 either 1400 other buildings have been destroyed in six human lives being lost.	0.0
So I don't know when that was made in a for that much to be burden to only have lost six people so far. I mean, yeah, six people still six people but for that much to burn and still have only six losses so far bus, it's crazy and they get pretty violent fires pretty quickly down there.	0.0
So why don't you told us about exploding eucalyptus trees and yeah, yeah.	0.0
Yeah. Did you hear that episode with them tell ya He's he's talking about with the trees just like yeah, the tree gets on fire and then it explodes in and there's like eucalyptus oil everywhere not because he said the only way it's going to go well with his fifty fifty millimeters of rain, which they don't get very often.	0.0
Yeah see with least with us. We know it's gonna eventually get cold like it is right now eventually the fires are gonna go out come October September October. We know no matter how big the fire is going to eventually die off, you know might rekindle.	0.0
Doing it with Summer again, but exactly and it's actually safe to travel around Australia when there's no fire units will be killed by snakes and spiders and everything will kill you they're coming to whether or not it was going to Australia and then my uncle Kev, that's really. Not this week, but he sent me a picture of a spider that was in the corner of his house. And then I just I vowed never to even go there laughs let alone limp there as I know. You're fine. Yeah. Yeah, I'll stay. I'll stay here. Yeah, so we hope and wish and thoughts and everything else are going out to all the people that are heading over there and helping them out and everyone that's already there doing their job and everybody is obviously going through the hassles and the struggles of having to deal with this stuff as well. Stay safe. Tonight we are going to be talking about about Narcan. So Todd you were in I think two weeks ago and you did a Narcan course for the boys, right? We did.	0.0
Yeah, I felt like pretty good. We had a pretty good crew in the in the hall. Yeah. It's a big thing that I've been working in. My normal job. A lot is a lot of Education and Training people on the locks own and just changing a lot of the stigmas and the Misinformation out there voted as well because everything is a miracle drug and and you know, there's lots of things that people are ingesting and so are smoking or or injecting and in our locks on will not actually reduce or reverse those effects with more people think that if somebody takes something and they've overdose that naloxone is the golden ticket is not so lots of good information with that.	1.0
So the locks is actually the drawer Ugh, but in Arkansas The Branding, yeah, there's a brand brand name versus the is there a is there another form of Martin Nowak some is there like Lotto know like is there any like so there's our can which is a kind of a loser than another Milwaukee that you could buy I don't know action is the one that I've ever been exposed to.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
It kind of looks like no loss is a drunkard. Yeah. Yeah.	0.0
Yeah. Yeah, I can answer that.	1.0
Not sure so what so maybe just run? Through a little bit on what you taught us in the training.	1.0
So basically the all the kids that we have that we hand out that general public get there's ampules point 4 mils per milliliter of Apple of the naloxone in the kits and there's three samples per kit with three syringes and there's also nasal atomizer naloxone that people get handed out as well majority of the law enforcement's usually have those There are four milligrams. They work pretty well. However, the majority of the ones that are handed out are all the inter muscular injectable injectable kits. So those ones that we talked about are just wanted to really expose everybody on what's in the kit how to properly use it then we talked a lot about how to actually recognize and respond to an opiate overdose. And we talked about some of the myths of of the overdose responses as well. So this is just for us. Nervous system depressants from opiates specifically and not certain certain stimulants.	0.0
All right, I think one of the biggest things that you so much stuff that I took from that was the fact that it's not all about just like certain people certain lifestyle. Yeah, definitely because I know some of our like summer guys were like, why are we where are we learning a essentially help with drug addict?	1.0
Exactly.	1.0
It would not only because everybody's in human we should be helping them but also so because things you were saying about it could there's so many varieties.	1.0
So there's the typical what people see in the media right that people living on the street that are using hardcore drugs. That's what is all of the TV. So that's what people think that that's where the crisis is, but it's anywhere from The Accidental overdoses from people or first-time users sharing a pill Young. Is trying to get high first first time sharing a fake Dilaudid or something and they accidentally overdose versus just a an elderly patient who may have certain morphine or Dilaudid on board as well other pain medications if they accidentally take too much that still isn't stolen overdose. And if you have a kid, you could still use that to help them come out of it. You have there's there's so many facets to to being able to respond to an emergency and there's could be totally though just those accidental overdoses fentanyl now is in everything. Some people are putting it in in cigarettes and selling them as Cocoa Puffs. So they think it's cocaine mixed in with the tobacco. However, it's actually fentanyl it's fennel. So cheap, right? So they gets caught with everything we're seeing in our area now with one of the the team's I On we're seeing friend all in everything. We're seeing in crystal meth we're seeing in cocaine. We're seeing it in marijuana. So people are just lazy it with it. So you never know what you're getting. So people always argue with us say, oh, it's I get it from my normal guy fickle that street pharmacist. Sorry. It's not gonna be it's not gonna be as as good or as pure as you said, you never know the consistency of it. So when you Consistency. I always go back to one story of you know, two people they want to split a pill they break it in half. The one person takes it he over also the other person takes the other half. He's not going to overdose and the reason is because it's there's no consistency that you can't you can't mix it super well, like I always describe taking a handful of salt throwing it on table take a pinch of salt and so the color Sprinkle it over that and you're going to see a random assortment of different colors specs in nicer cutting that up into piles that one pile might have two specs three specs for aspects that other pile might only had one Speck and depending on where that spec gets put on your side of the pill or whatever wherever you're smoking or injecting. You don't know the consistency of it. So that's why some people overdose harder and go down while harder than others when you you took a picture of	0.0
Was it heroin or cocaine?	1.0
Oh those three yes, three finger and vials with yeah, some different levels of drugs. We had to know there's you know, like the one with the heroin fentanyl car fentanyl.	0.0
Yeah, which is there one was like you didn't even were able to make the practice where you so the heroin was with her. Yeah. It was like there's a lot of fair My Heroine in this file and it was the was like how much they hire how much to be lethal was that was that picture?	0.0
Well, That was just talking with a lethal dose alike.	0.0
So late as a good visual the show like like let's say a quarter mil in a vial of powder of heroin could be a weird lethal dose and then it showed a vial of Fentanyl and it was only a couple of specs like candy or something - well, there's like one or two little specks in it. So it just goes to show you the volume of how much stronger is because people always here at stake. It's a hundred times stronger than morphine is hundred strong kind of the Fentanyl and then car fennel is another a hundred times stronger, right?	0.0
So yeah, that's a good visual people like seeing that so it's like yeah, maybe that's what a lot of people a lot of our guys stuck with them because you know, it gives them something because I think people think oh, it's still still a lot of fentanyl you need. No, it's like basically the salt like a little very small amount.	0.0
It's insanely strong. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah. I think I was listening to and I mentioned you guys that she the on Joe Rogan November 7th episode 1379 there was Investigative journalist, his name was Ben Westhoff, and he wrote a book called fentanyl Inc. How Rogue chemists are creating the deadliest wave of the opioid epidemic and he just talks about it like him when he went to you goes to China and it's like the drug dealers are kind of making this stuff and I cheap it is to get hold of this stuff. Right? It's insane which is why everyone's cutting it with cutting it into everything. It's just it's a quick easy boost. I think he said something like it's just like 50 times. Stronger than heroin so to Rice grains of it basically can can absolutely decimate it like insanity episode 2 listening to you.	0.0
Can you explain - on what is it doing it? Like it makes it basically shuts them down. So they stop breathing right because it was right.	0.0
So so opiates there are several nervous system depressant. So people think they called an overdose emergency by this actually respiratory emergency like it's going to decrease your Drive so much. You're going to be very slow respirations to know respirations. So when we talk about signs and symptoms, those are a lot of the signs that we looked at. We looked at what's their breathing rate is going to be like eight respirations and minute or less or not reading at all. Now they're going to be signed on if it'll be blue in the lips pale blue. The fingertips could be very sweaty or die Frederick it go to be little bit of vomitus or foam in there are way as well and then the pinpoint people sort of are the other tell Tale sign right there is what some crews are seeing now. They're seeing some other drugs on board that are really they're still keeping them depressed. So we're giving them the locks on and it's knocking off the little bits off of your opiate receptors and blocking it appropriately where it should be but the people are still saying depressed from another drug on board so I can benzodiazepines and other things like that. So, What what we're seeing now with that is that still that respiratory emergency like you we can't forget that we need to breathe for these people on all oxygenate them and then transport them. So in our back to our kits and suffering of that were teaching is we follow this the save me campaign so stands for stimulate Airway ventilate evaluate your medication and then evaluate again, so we want to stimulate try and get them. Awake painful stimulation see if they respond at all. They don't respond. Then we go into the airway. So we're opening their Airway. Then we're going to be ventilating because it's that central nervous system depressant is depressing their respiratory drive and we want to auction auction them and breathe for them. We want to breathe one breath every five seconds for them and we can keep them alive and keep them sustained by breathing for them without even giving them logs on fruit and then after that then I'll give more value eight if there's no real response and we get into her medication and then at that point we will be administering your first story dose of point for intramuscular. So we taught everybody had a breakdown feels drawn up properly and landmark throw it in a few other Miss like that people think need to expose the scan. You can't you can go right through the clothing if you have to sew in the deltoid or the thighs the best spot as well.	0.0
I think some of our some people are afraid to give a needle because they you know, they're afraid it is the old unit given are putting air bubble and then and yeah and of them and they're going to have some of you may die from stroke or an air embolism exactly.	0.0
So it's it's safe.	1.0
Like I always tell people, you know, when you hold that syringe back up, you can see the are in just slowly push the plunger of the syringe up until that are is gone. You don't need to see in the movie spurting out of the syringe because we're not wasting our naloxone, you know, just until that are is out and if there is still Mariner totally fine. It's not gonna do anything to you. It's like said it's not like the movies.	1.0
It's not going to completely stop your heart disease because he's an intramuscular that's mainly is gas into Moscow.	0.0
How many are our bodies will absorb even a fair amount of error intravenously as well.	0.0
Yeah. Yeah. I was talking one of the other paramedics in the one who's saying. Yeah, you said it will like the earthing.	1.0
Yeah one air bubble when everybody was going to kill you you'd be dead in the hospital.	0.0
Is that happen? Yeah, so it's good. It's so we had lots of training IP.	1.0
As for people to practice and draw that up because it is a it is a fine motor skills hard for a lot of people to figure it out and people notice first time they met me you handled the syringe, right? So they would need to practice with it and learn how to use it draw it out. Because in that in that moment people panic people forget to eventually the forget all the other little stuff that is started grabbing that that kit and start drawing it up which at the end of the day is good you're getting it in but we need to ventilate these people up there gonna be brain-dead afterwards. Otherwise, we need to we need to get that option in them and we injected	0.0
- yeah, I heard you killed a bunch of hard. Yeah. Yeah, but did you see we're just so I guess you know, it's another one of those things that know especially I know that we're starting to carry them on on truck now right for yeah.	0.0
Well Todd was good enough to give us one for each truck Victor got put in appropriately. So we were in have those now and like we had said it's not necessarily. I mean, we're not our guys aren't popping pills and there and you know, we're not we're not currently attending these. Because the video games is still going but you get the secondary exposures, which way is he really talking about.	1.0
Yeah, and that's one thing we did. I mean that's why we put them on our trucks initially as well as is. Yes. Anybody can be trained to use this cat like there is young children that know how to use these kits and can can administrate them. However, you know for us responding we needed a plan. We need an operational guideline for a second as Bowser for us because I've seen it numerous First I'm the and I'm sure many other people have is where you're either in a residence or your Patty somebody down or you're trying to get them into the back of the ambulance or it's in a car accident where there's a lot of paraphernalia left over or sitting close to them. So if you get exposed to that and we need a plan for our size, so if we're not carrying it, we're not prepared then if we come across something and we need to administer it it's still there for us and you're totally covered under the Good Samaritan. I can be see anyways.	0.0
Okay, yeah. Let's go. So yeah, I mean now now we've got them on the trucks against another one of those tools in the toolbox ready to use when you need them an important tool obviously, like you said, especially for secondary exposures, especially in MV eyes. You never know what you're rolling up on when you're opening those doors and I think we spoke about that before especially with the RZ masks actually as well. Yeah, they're good a set of four orphans.	1.0
I'm sorry mask on I don't know one of the are our time. So so areas was the drug 100 the car that we did that one.	0.0
Yeah.	1.0
Yeah you were I see on Denim and then yeah, I'm using right away like yeah, he had a baggy on the - yeah, because scenario was you know, we're in a parking lot of these people are just kind of passed out like there's no signs of accent or anything Todd see this. Sorry that guy he see right away is like are you thinking it's some sort of a OD course, there's three people in the car and none of them were responsive really and one of them may be in the back. Is still someone at the Atlantic and yeah right away. We open the doors. He said I'm putting on masks everything like that. And then he's got me looking for any drug paraphernalia and we have found some white powder in the front. The best board has treated it like that. So it was it was good to see that scenario worked in to do that that sort of event now go get you thinking about it.	1.0
Right like you need to because we need to take responsibility of that scene and you know in our areas if we don't have law enforcement there right away, you know, we need to be aware of how to handle it just enough to make it safe so we can work around it and then leave it alone. Like I'm telling people that No transferred into a Ziploc bag and things like that and put in your pocket to handle the police later. But yeah people need to be aware of secondary suppose for that type stuff for sure.	1.0
Right? I mean, there's been a few tacos few the law enforcement geysers. They've had some wrestling matches with guys, you know, and they are there in there in there cell block or there are there on the street, you know, they're they're taking a person down to Cuff them to rest them in the next thing they finding out why powder all over them because they this guy's been trying to hide his drugs so that They've been exposed a few of actually went down with exposure. So that's why they get there. That's why both some carry that like you were saying they carry the the nasal atomizer.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
Yeah, and those just talked about those real quick to those are four milligrams generally and the reason being for that is, you know, it's a One-Shot dose and the in the Nares and the way it's absorbed and you can lose so much out of that nostril as well not just on placement and everything. So that's why it's a Larger dose for that because people always worry about what's going to be too much of a loading dose. What if they come up out of withdrawals or or not, but it's there's so many aspects to that of how well it gets placed to when you administer it to how much runs out the absorption rate the work. So right.	0.0
So one thing we hear about is the yeah, we can come up. Yeah, but they come up if you love them too much, but she's fast.	1.0
I guess well the big thing I mean we want to bring them up slowly, but we want to	1.0
Section 8 and ventilate these people because when they're coming up there's a very misconception that people are hammering with the locks on and they come up swing and they're just fighting. Yeah. Well, I'm sure they're probably fighting but they're hypoxic. They're you know, they're not thinking straight some of them. Yes, they come up you can kick them in withdrawals. If you give too much of a dough. So we generally start with point four point eight than one milligram, etc. Etc. But yeah, we don't like to hammer him right away with one two milligrams immediately because you can cook them. Into withdrawals. There's a very small percentage of people that could present with like a flash pulmonary edema, but the bacon is with those withdrawals. So then yeah, you won one of their going to feel gross from the barf, you know, then could have a whole other vast problems going to go into a seizure. But yeah, usually you're getting a little bit of a fight with them. They're getting a little nasty because of the hypoxia as well write that lack of oxygen for so long.	0.0
Sonia belly comes in place. I was concerned because wait Miss and introduce me on bedding, which is actually we were discussed this before the podcast though. There was a you know, when I went down taking that course in La we didn't talk about this part, but that was one of things they were talking about was there was of course I was taken and they open it up for firefighters and it was nutritionally for law enforcement and Military, but they opened up for firefighters and paramedics is because of that reason because they getting they get there. Maybe the police are on scene because it's it's a patient. It's not the next thing they're in a fight with them in the back of an ambulance are on the street. Is that video? We should we posted WE Post we put I think we posted it.	0.0
Right. Did you do you posted?	1.0
All right. Yeah, and that wasn't a it was those are some guy mad because they're perfect show up here late for his car fire or something. But just that generally people are getting getting it assaulted anytime anywhere.	0.0
It seems nine people be crazy and you know back to bring them up with naloxone like, you know, if you have the means as a responder with like a bag valve mask and oxygen no freeze for them. Give them that oxygen concentration. That's just going to help them come up so much nice. Afterwards where we're getting those fights is we're rolling up on scene and people are hammering with naloxone prior to our arrival, but they're not doing in ventilating then we start ventilating then we give them a little bit more logs on and then they come up from the quickly right? It's probably because they've already got a pile of Narcan in them, but then there are hypoxic and then we're battling that so they're just confused.	0.0
Very good.	1.0
Yeah the lot of the overdose that I've been on before is, you know, we start ventilating them. And it's totally safe.	1.0
It's controlled as calm or breathing for them.	1.0
Then you get ready. Then you give them the naloxone you bring them up slow. It's way safer. Yeah you then they'll come up they get a little confused. They pull their way out and then they'll start talking to you. Some of them come to the hospital. Some of them don't someone tell us to peace out. But yeah, we want these people to be transported to the hospital or at least if they refuse service to be with somebody to be monitored because Locks on will have a shorter shelf life. It will burn off faster in their system than the opiates.	1.0
Well the exhibit ask you about that because you'd told me before sometimes you just you are kind of and then after a while you just carry on your way. Like you guys are just leaving. Yeah if they wanted to yeah, but then tell us that counts and I was wondering what back is eventually like you said dinner kind of wears off quicker than the opioid so that like mentioned of those go back out possibly. Yeah, exactly.	1.0
So the generally the naloxone has a shelf life and like 45 minutes 40 minutes somewhere around there I think and so the opiates will reattach to the ER opiate receptors in your body and then you'll start going on and not again, so it's just exactly what sounds like you're nodding off asleep you're falling asleep. So they could potentially go down again generally will give repeat doses over with them or by that time the hospital will end up giving a repeat dose if they're still willing to stay in the hospital. Some people actually go on the locks on drip in the Bill because they've got such strong opiates in their system.	0.0
So with that I mean again on that broken Puck I said they were talking about some insane numbers of people that actually had died more recently. Obviously those numbers have gone up dramatically since especially since the fentanyl surface started coming in but it what kind of do you know of any kind of numbers it could be floating around for even just BC. Oh, yes. Yeah so our	0.0
crisis it eventually became an epidemic in 2015 and then this for BC alone for last last year in 2018. We had a total of fifteen hundred and forty-one overdose deaths here in BC that those numbers are dropping substantially from the previous years mostly from the information about opiates and how it can affect vast variety of people and also just the Carrying a kit, you know having having kids out there.	0.0
So I mean, I guess the big thing now obviously off the back of that is we obviously you know, because we knew you it was it worked out for us, but if somebody let's say somebody else somewhere else was looking to get this sort of training. Who would you recommend they go and talk to start having this conversation.	1.0
I think the big thing is look out the people in your area as far as if it's other paramedics that can at least stereo the right way. Way or in your department if you guys have other Educators because that made this game be tied in with a lot of public education. So far Services can get out there and do that as well. If you're a trainer talk to your local Health authorities and healthy and it's there the big ones that'll that'll kind of front this for sure.	1.0
Yeah. I don't know if Ashley I would just down in Nevada. You want to Vegas we were talking at one of the Uber drivers about Opioids and stuff because we were when we're driving the ground to cover rougher part down and they were cut you just kind of surprised that we even do Narcan they were saying oh, yeah, we did we did start entering couple last week. He's like, why would you guys have that I would you guys help so I don't know if some of the some of the states are less open-minded to that sort of stuff. So no because I don't like California is but yeah California's a lot. BC from I understand but I think certain States down there are maybe not quite as open.	0.0
Well, that's just it's all public education. Right? I mean, there's so many opinions with it like you got a lot of harsh opinions and well, why are you helping some of these overdosed, you know like but like I said like with when somebody approaches me, I just tell them they look like I've literally my career I've had to resuscitate like 14 year olds from Man overdosed in the past and it wasn't intentional like they're not a drug user. It was a first-time experiment that went South man. Everybody's got a mom and dad right? And so they're very happy that we brought them back. So there's a there's a lot of information on there just needs to the public needs to be aware of and it could be anybody could be completely accidental.	0.0
That's the other side of it too. I mean, it's not just the accidental side of things is the fight that stuff's in anything. These days right? Like you said you could have you could have bummed a cigarette off of somebody and all of a sudden they gave you the wrong one prescription meds. Right?	0.0
Like you could be taking heavy prescription narcotics due to a chronic or an acute event in your life traumatic pain or something and accidentally take too many or mix another pill that makes you more subsequent to overdose. Right like you never know. So having that just that knowledge around it. It's you how to recognize the Uh science, so it's it's big nowadays. It's a different world. We're in now.	0.0
Okay, one thing for sure down the states with their veterans going back. Well, then, you know, they've been blown up shot. There. Are those pills are you talking to?	1.0
Yeah, and you know at the end of the day Latos, the the prescription meds are safe. But if you do combine some of them you are more prone to a possible overdose. You got to be very aware of the timing when you take them.	0.0
Have a conversation find out if if you weren't using it. It's a good idea to at least have the conversation and at least be trained on it because there may be a time where you need it. I was lucky enough that Todd managed to give me a kit and I still carry it with me and my go back you never know just in case right even though you might have froze at the other human like a Frozen and I might need a new one. But yeah, they're they're useful to have you never know. Situation and yeah again seems the tourniquet right should probably carry one never know when you might need it and it will put it over.	1.0
But yeah, let's show some announcements.	1.0
Yeah, I'm sorry ashes in there.	0.0
So I guess I got any more to see. All right, dude, yelling you gonna do you have a second to know? I don't yeah.	0.0
Yeah, that's a mortise.	0.0
They make pretty cool gear. They make the snagger tool which we talked about. I've seen it used.	1.0

You know, I know there's a couple techniques like what we call when we call the Jimi Hendrix that it that is taxing on you. It is tiring did use that method just it's To remove two and a half by yourself standing up. It does deplete you put the this negative when I when I used it as actually it's quite quite a lot easier to handle hose that big run a full. Yeah. So motifs that makes them kind of other cool stuff door wedges and things check them out on their website. We're supposedly getting some new stuff.	1.0

Down there.	1.0
We all know Happy Thanksgiving in retrospect to all you're giving of thank turkeys deep-fried turkey fryers are was last week and there was so many videos that popped up for ya. It's insane. How many people do that?	1.0
Well, it's like, you know, we did that thing though.	1.0
Yeah. When would we waited for our fire? It's October and then we did that we starting.	1.0
A pot of oil and then we dump water on it and like blew up from yeah, of course, you have a frozen turkey some people set up a frozen turkey the stick it in this giant pot of almost burning. Well, I tell you she's gonna boil over and I had my first deep-fried.	1.0
It is freaking delicious Thanksgiving with Matt and few other friends. Wow. Amazing.	1.0
Yeah. No, I I've had worse.	0.0
They're good.	1.0
I think the thing is people drop it into fasten or too much oil and overflows and what's actually causing the fires and hits the The Browns the thing on top and bottom burner the burner. Thank you as firefighters is actually their official name.	0.0
Yes. Yes, you have reported mentioned. Nothing. Just keep me alive won't stop the bleed look online.	1.0
Stop the bleed dot org, or Control dot org look to see if there's any sort of courses or upcoming events in your areas. Hemorrhage control is is a huge one. We've been talking a lot about it and really doing a lot of classes up here and are so pack and tourniquets huge.	1.0
It was actually a when we were down in Vegas. I noticed every security guard. It wasn't just a police every security guy have a tourniquet on there on the belt and most actually had some of them even had like a like a like big. Well, I'll a mishandle my fact like bang it's pretty good to see and I know they haven't had a pretty big incident on there. So they're probably a little more on edge and many of us but there's good to see even just security had the Rudy I could see the see the orange cap on them.	1.0
So this being prepared to accept those the packing those tourniquets haven't actually it out of the wrapper makes a bigger and on your on your person and that hemostatic gauze and learning how to actually properly pack those wounds and then deal with with bleeding a lot of missed there again people talking about breaking myths, you know, putting tourniquets on loosing it off, you know, the blood flowing again.	0.0
Yeah. Keep it tight.	1.0
We'll keep them alive. Exactly Yeah, we actually got follow-up. Video for the womb packing which will be out sometime this week.	1.0
So all right. Yeah, I'm probably do that. Yeah, so that'll be a trap.	0.0
Yeah, stop the bleed and then we have second alarm dot-org our friend Matt his calls they are trying to help all of us put more firefighters in our holes and on our trucks everybody understands and knows. I'm sure that there is an epidemic. It is a lack of volunteers with the great great service that we all are part of and my is trying to really help fix that problem. So if you have some time head over a second alarm dot-org check and mate give him some love and yeah, and then is actually one more. Oh, yeah, except my gloves.	1.0
Because our rap can he let me a pair and he came by the they just you know, they were holding up and showed him because I'd be wearing them their execution gloves. So I was wearing them. We've had a lot of expectations at least because I'm wearing the training ground moving pallets and nails are sticking it means of a from just debris and I'm being stabbed or anything like that. So it was actually night when Todd was here with his the Narcan so I took one of the needles and was	1.0
Just yourself down myself.	1.0
I mean eventually it's gonna go through into the middle. So, you know, we actually stuff one of the oranges in there and I started stabbing it but it actually it took a bit. It took a fair amount of pressure wouldn't be like, you know, you're not going to someone's trying to stab you with a needle and you put your hand in this course you're going through but it's definitely was really good for her like the needle poke when you're you know, if you're just, you know, touch the patient and all of a sudden they had maybe something on because it actually did bend the needle and he will send it been for me pushing it and I don't know if you saw that I think you're dealing with something else. And yeah, the needle is actually Bent by the end and by the time I went through so they're actually pretty good HEX number gloves interesting.	1.0
Yeah, because we talk about specific needle issues, especially with with if there's a user that's actually using an intravenously the once you see syringes are they usually use those needles are usually bent out a lot of times as well. Yeah. So when people Pat them down, that's when they get this the that stick we don't want. Of course reaching in their pockets during your pad Downs outs. Yeah. Yeah. We're yeah.	1.0

Hey guys, so welcome to big facts podcast with Thomas and I'm Ricky with the huge bags podcast and I'm Dave with the gigantic friggin facts. Are you?	1.0
Okay? So basically we're going to be doing synonyms. When we do our big part of it just for fun because why not also guys who's listening. This is our first pod. Past of course. It's called big facts podcast re trying but it was cool. So we did it. It's set for a comedy. We're trying to do more of a PG-13 type things for all audiences. We're going to keep swearing down to a minimum. They're going to we're trying to keep it around a 30 minutes for each podcast, but if it gets into like a good heated discussion and we start arguing about stuff not or not saying we're going to end in 30 minutes, but I'm probably keep going to be honest. Keep it going also as of right now if you want you can also subscribe keep listening and we should be on other things like Spotify. We're gonna probably be on Apple Google Play anything where you can listen. Those are the most popular ones. But yeah, so we're going to get right into the podcast. We have some	1.0
great topics actually today so I can already hear a few.	1.0
I am right now so I have to like I'm traveling but when I'm not traveling we most likely be getting together and doing the podcast together. So some of them will have better audio. We're probably at some point if this gets popular enough for we get long enough into it, we might buy a better microphone were together and use that but for now, we're doing this this way because it's the best we got so Ricky G or day if you have any ideas for what you want to do for our first topic of discussion today.	0.0
I want to talk about times. Cartoons predicted the future of already got it loaded up pretty weird one gone here.	1.0
Alright, so If you guys don't know already if you've watched any favorite TV shows like Simpsons family guy Futurama American Dad. I don't know if they really predicted anything. Yeah stuff like cartoons. Yeah older cartoons. Yeah, all these cartoons and all these shows have actually had an addiction to something that happened in the future a couple years after the show like that episode as are Simpsons they think the creator of it is a time traveler, which would make sense. He's predicted like 18 to 20 things. And hold like life work like doing it. One of the biggest ones was the Mitt Romney thing where he was trying to vote for Obama and it kept going it was the machine that kept voting for Mitt Romney. There's that one. They predicted 9/11 early so that it was that they are becoming president. Yeah, that one they predicted 16. No. Yes, 16 years. They had the exact same place. He was at like as it was happening all the other thing they predicted which was really interesting was the God particle. I don't know if you guys know that one, but they had like Homer Simpson was writing on a board and he had I guess it was really close to the exact equation that was used to Sorry for the actual God particle, and I don't know how I don't know about me. But you put that together that if it says that close to the God particle, you might have you might be thinking something. You know what I mean? Like it's not part of God Particle because I have no idea.	1.0
What a God Particle is.	1.0
Well, it's I'll just explain real fast, but it has its particle that like start of the universe the Big Bang.	1.0
Once you have a quick suggestion, yeah, what's your suggestion? Probably shouldn't talk about that because there could be listeners who are religious.	0.0
We weren't talking too much. And yeah, this is this is nothing. Yeah. I was just I was just playing with the God particle was it's not I'm not getting into the religion part of the I was just saying how they predicted that equation. Of course that that was not just a sense of either.	0.0
There's a cartoon an old cartoon Hey Arnold and the Rebecca we're standing in a classroom. Blackboard and writing on Chalk written in chalk on the Blackboard where the words stay woke and underneath that was some coordinates not. I'm years later at those exact coordinates. Bin Laden was found shot to death.	0.0
Yeah, so great. So these cartoons that were like predicting parts of the future now, I don't know if it's you guys but like at this point in time, I think I'm starting to watch them since a lot more just to see like If they can if they're going to predict anything else about the future, you know what I mean? Like I've been starting to watch The Simpsons more because you know, if they predicted 20 things they're mostly can be a good something else in the oven. So that was the topic of discussion for that while we're on the topic. Anyways, anyone have a favorite like cartoon they watch	1.0
The guy got a good old Jack Horseman is my favorite cartoon. Pretty cool.	1.0
That is not bad at all.	1.0
SpongeBob's the classic.	1.0
That's a class. It's like you seem like a normie if you're going to talk about SpongeBob, you know what I mean? Cause like that's just like wonderful back to you if you just say I watched SpongeBob, okay, but everyone watched one fathers and so if it's your favorite like that's true at least once or twice. Yeah. Like Regular Show or something like that and that's interesting. You know, I mean regular so I eventually time was good.	0.0
But I feel like they fell off near the end, you know, I mean they because their age group was like 12 to like 14 and by the time that it like like got to its peak it definitely fell off because all of the viewers got older and yeah,	0.0
Well, I don't I don't even think it's that I feel like Cartoon Network was is rushing their older shows to end so they can get New Orleans on like I feel like any old show that was on Cartoon Network's offended all forgetting a very important part to what Rick and Morty.	0.0
Oh, okay. You can okay.	1.0
You can enjoy Rick and Morty and all right, but when they come out with a new season It takes forever. They grandly put them out like it's not even like a season like it doesn't come in order like every year. It's like randomly done.	0.0
Actually. They just got an order for like three more seasons.	1.0
Okay, so then maybe now they'll come in they'll come faster.	1.0
But I mean if I remember correctly, I believe I remember Rick at the end of an episode shouting nine more seasons or something.	1.0
That's a prediction. It sounds like Okay, so, you know when we did a Szechuan sauce, I was so sad that I didn't not get any like I went there and I was waiting for the time because they said oh yeah 2 p.m. Is when we'll be putting it people got out of me for that. Like he got a 6:00 a.m. They were giving it out when they weren't supposed to I was a little pissed I kind of wanted to taste it isn't it? Like duck sauce for something isn't like really not or sweet and sour sauce. Yeah.	0.0
So can we talk about something a lot of the Cartoon Network cartoons, you know Adventure Time the Gravity Falls the hepatic artery.	1.0
That's what every guy would involve a lot of whatever but cartoons like that.	1.0
They had a lot of potential especially with Gravity Falls. Yeah, like I was just kind of time thinking I was here. They had a lot of potential to have a lot deeper of the storyline than they did exactly.	0.0
That's actually Grand Falls did In Gravity Falls was like if you were really into it there they put secret messages and stuff. They had like a lot of things actually at the end of the at the end of the show. If you were when they were on the bus, there's like a secret message and you pee decoded it. It said something and then a guy posted something on a store on his Twitter later and like a year later and it was like a whole scavenger hunt set up by the person through the show. So and then like it was interesting actually.	1.0
You like all of the seasons before the finale on Disney XD and I was I was like Loki sad because I was like damn this was a great show and it's about to be gone.	0.0
They only did one season, right?	1.0
They know Gravity Falls got a couple of things they did not do three.	0.0
I think they only did like two seasons. They weren't very for some reason. They were really good show but I'm surprised it only didn't like to season and then they took it off.	1.0
Well part of the reason a lot of these shows aren't getting enough time to Like progress the story is because streaming is like taking over the game right now. That is true. Yeah, really putting a lot of operating on our TV channels and such that's on Netflix. Like a lot of stuff is on Netflix and Hulu know and those things that people would rather see then stuff that's on actual.	0.0
All right. All right. Well, I'll let me bring this up. I think able companies are actually It's going to it's going to do a cycle and come back to cable companies. I can tell you this right now because so many different types of streaming services are coming up and they're taking all their shows basically off of Netflix and they're like, okay. Well now you have to get our streaming service fee and watch the show. So, okay. I want to watch Friends. They're gonna probably take that off at some point and they're going to go to a special streaming for that like thing. You want to watch any Disney thing. I have to get the distant screaming now, but I want to watch that.	0.0
Its original so now I have Disney and I have Netflix original that's already what $14 along with frickin like you've got Disney right that it's got like all the Marvel movies, right? Yeah. Now you you've got DC entertainment when they're like dumb expensive. They're like 20 bucks a month. I'm like, yeah, see I feel like because I mean I haven't had a cable for like seven years and I know what a lot of other people don't have cable anymore either because honestly, it's just become Obsolete and I know streaming is definitely having a decline right now just because you're still meant it like the oversaturation. Yeah and stuff, but I don't think it's gonna Circle back to Cable. I feel like there's gonna be some something new like kill them.	0.0
That yeah. Yeah, I can see that.	1.0
Well, I mean, I mean we're already starting to get that aren't we? I see these that have like Hulu or Netflix built right into them.	1.0
I mean, yes, okay, but I mean you can do you YouTube TV technically would be it you get you to bread and then you can actually watch TV with it which that would be the closest to streaming and but that's streaming and obviously like Netflix like like here's what I'm thinking like some time. Not maybe like in the near future, but in the future future, I'm feeling like maybe like Netflix and Verizon team up like and collaborate that I don't I don't I would not want to eat like a cable company teaming up with us big streaming service, you know what I mean? Because like cables already pretty big they make a lot of money off phones and stuff their phones for different thing. Yeah, but I mean like it's that's still part of strain can still get your streaming stuff on the phone.	0.0
So it's like all right, you know, you gotta kind of pity Netflix. I mean that took yeah, they're massive.	0.0
They're not they're not gonna do so I can know you see them.	0.0
I mean big already Netflix is already having such a major Decline and I know they took a lot of shows off and they said it was because they wanted to focus more on Netflix originals, which I get. Put you should do that. That's what killed them. Yeah, yeah. Yeah old shows or just like that just watching cartoons or anything like a Netflix took a lot of those kinds of shows off. I mean I went on to this day. I want to watch one of my favorite shows lost. Right? Yeah, it's 12 slots and that puts all the time. It's a really good show and then I went out and it was gone. Yes egg egg whites been on the books for years.	0.0
All right.	1.0
White Chicks was on Netflix. Oh my God. So yeah, and then they took it off and I was like white chicks was like wait, no white chicks watch a movie or religiously White Chicks. Movie with the two cops that like dressed up as the women, right? Yeah or something else. Yeah. Yeah that movie was so funny facts. I watched it so many times I know real anymore and they took all the like the Defenders all these like I don't like Family Guy, it's not enough anymore. Yeah, and I know a lot of you guys are fans stranger things. season 3	0.0
903 I love stranger things.	1.0
He is in one right? I got really into it and then see some to don't came out watch like the first episode and I just never really got back into it, but I kind of want to know because I haven't really heard much about it, but I know a lot of people have really liked Lost there.	1.0
all right time for a second time first thing you guys don't try to talk over each other because it's like when you guys talk over each other it's not as good so	0.0
Yeah, yeah try not to do that.	0.0
I can I can do that just because it's off my recording for my voice but you guys can't because it's going to like for you guys so that's what that's gonna be in the corny, but that's okay. So we spent about like 13 minutes on this topic. Would you guys like to move on to the next topic? You can finish what you you can finish your thing? Might as well.	0.0
So that's how that's how it is with most TV shows that are on Netflix though. Like for example, I know like people are like, oh breaking bad. I started it got to like season 2 and then I like went to a different show and started watching that like that's what ever does is they'll start a show on Netflix watch to like the second or third season and if there's more than that, then they kind of lose interest and go to a different show and then come back to that show later. You know, I'm saying that's All right on the cycle, I guess.	0.0
Okay. So I want to do some would you rather questions are we have time it's halfway about through our podcast maybe a little longer.	1.0
We can go a little longer and cover only got four of them. It'll probably take about two or three.	1.0
That's fine. Okay, Ricky hit us up with the first would you rather?	1.0
So what we're going to do is I'll ask a question and all three of us will give a nice. Okay, the first question would you rather? Either be a teenager for never experienced your childhood. So basically start life at 18 with no recollection of any childhood or any experience.	1.0
I would actually so either be a teenager. Or wait start your life without being without a childhood or be a teenager.	1.0
Wait, say it again be a teenager for never experienced like your childhood and teenage years. So basically come into the world at 18 with no experience, but still, you know, the maturity of an 18 year old.	0.0
Alright, so you become a teenager right away. Okay, I'm going to have to be with the one where teenager.	1.0
How about you David?	1.0
I'm gonna say I'm gonna say teenager because a childhood is what makes someone you know, yeah, you're an idiot that growing as we go with the option to actually I would skip my childhood and go right into 18 because I've now I could mean yeah, I could see this being like I guess it depends on like your situation how you grew up to be honest, but if you had a As her to like, okay, I'm answering 17. But like if I guess if you know if your life was going to be good that you probably want to do it have a Teenage life. But if you know, it's not going to be good. Let's just skip that and go right to being an adult. You know what I mean?	0.0
Yes, I am ready to be 18 get out of my house and just be done with all that to him you stopped. So I would start off 18 or skip all that. This one is the opposite end of it. It's not thoughtful at this makes you cringe OMG you rather eat a whole bowl of cockroaches or one hold. Both of them are wrong.	0.0
Wait.	1.0
Say it again eat a bowl of roaches like cockroaches. Yeah for eat a whole rack for both of them are raw.	1.0
Both are raw brat. No, wait a minute. Let me think this through I'm definitely going to go matter see no matter which one you eat. You're most likely going to it's probably going to get you stick.	0.0
And so don't worry about don't like don't think about sickness or anything will say immediately afterwards you go to the hospital and get great antibiotics all that, you know the eating part which was you rather have to suffer through. I would rather suffer through I could probably eat a rat I would do a red because a rat it's like a wonderful thing. And once you're done with it, you're done with the I feel like with cockroaches or multiple. Love them and you have to experience it like over and over again until you finish the bowl when we eating for it's a it's a bowl or just say one a bowl of cockroaches. So say oh yeah later time.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
And I would go with the roaches. I mean the rat does sound easier to eat through quote with the roaches the organs and the organs are a lot smaller. You're not chewing through what you know, is that you know, yeah.	1.0
Yeah, that's true that is but that is a hard one to really go through. I was thinking cockroach at first but I mean, it's a whole bowl and I don't think I could eat a whole bowl of cockroaches. Let's just this really disgusting in general. Brother, who is this one cockroach. Maybe was The Whole Bowl.	0.0
That's just like that's a no on me.	0.0
Okay, go next one much less disgusting question.	0.0
Would you rather marry and live with forever somebody that you hate that you like cannot stand right or be alone forever and live with your parents for your entire life.	0.0
Okay. Well see this that's a if I live with my parents my entire life, but most likely be dead, you know, like before I die. So like technically would I die at the same time they die because if I'm going to be late my parents would have to either live until I die or I die when they die, you know what I mean? Patsy that's the type of thinking you have.	0.0
Because that question alone your parents you you'll live a full life. So you let the 80 and your parents are like superhuman and live to like a hundred and twenty or a hundred and forty or house.	1.0
Yeah, that wouldn't work because I think I have to choose the first one. I have to probably I probably marry in love with someone I hate because you can still make that somehow work. I feel like because it me, you're still gonna hate them doesn't say how hard like how harsh you hate them.	0.0
You know what I mean? Like well, yeah, it's like you can't hate them a little but but like yeah to go with you on that one too. I mean, there are plenty of marriages as we're tables hate each other and manage to make Yeah. Yeah, I think I'd want that but in this situation, I think it would do that because I mean like if you think about it, like if you if you live with your parents your whole life, you're not going to hit anyone like oh, that's the point. You're not supposed to throw this part of the second one, too. You'll be alone your whole life you like ever get a girlfriend or anything.	0.0
You probably want the You probably would want the first one at least.	1.0
Yeah, I want them when I would rather like have someone to make new experiences with rather than have the same routine every day, you know, so yeah. Okay Ricky. What's our last the last question? Would you rather go one year without your phone or like months without seeing a single person?	0.0
So one year without your phone for one month without seeing a	0.0
Single person. Okay. So on my solitary confinement, but you have your phone now.	0.0
Yeah, but okay, so no face. Yeah, I was going to say if you have your you can only tell ya that's gonna get boring if you will actually go insane. I don't think like I think I more likely would rather see people than have my phone on be honest with you.	0.0
Yeah, I'm gonna go with Thomas on this one because you can still you can you can actually talk to people you can say that you don't even have a phone.	1.0
He's got a nice bod ounces. Yeah, it work.	1.0

Mmm, I got I mean at least you can you can text me back. Yeah, but but if you can't see people, I mean you can't have you can't have Instagram and stuff on your phone.	0.0
That's true for Snapchat technically either. Yeah, that's probably what it be. Seeing many people.	1.0
Otherwise, that's anyway because I mean, well, it says it says you can't have it without my phone. This is you can have your phone doesn't say you can't have like a tablet or anything like that. True Tech didn't put the technically and you know, like you could tag technically have an iPod or a tablet or some type of the laptop that's kinda going through loophole on the questionnaire.	1.0
And I mean, it's not on the question that imported in so technically I mean not against the rule way to make me feel bad about not making my questions Pacific and North I'll do better next time. Don't worry.	1.0
Ricky to come out with would you rather and like it be something about dying this way and he like get really specific it would be like a four page essay on how like one thing and like or and it'll be like, okay. Ricky didn't have to be that specific. I know Thomas. I'm just making sure there's no loophole and this is all you hear is me get one local around like well you oh my god rather.	0.0
by being strangled in your Will you buy a black albino midget died from autoerotic asphyxiation and have your parents be the ones to find you? I don't even know what that second one means bro. Well, I'm not really gonna explain it but it's basically hanging yourself accidentally while doing things.	0.0

They pick up the ball turn around in like lightly toss it back employee comes over get out of my store and kicks him out, but the funniest actually even funnier than that. So the same day all this happened basically on the same day the small stuff Ricky Caleb and Ryan they all went to go to a store and buy the new year ago. Name it so Rick. He's like yo, Dave and Thomas. Can you watch my sister and my girlfriend make sure that you know just get into trouble you in trouble. So we're sitting there me and Dave on our phones maybe about four or five minutes later. They start whispering to each other and they they just booked it. They're gone, right they're not running but they're like walking really fast the way I looked at Dave and I go Dave where we should we watch them and they was like, yeah, we're probably like me. It's okay. Ricky really get it tells you had to and I like and then I go actually maybe right let's go. So we started going like to follow them. We were like, okay, let's not get too close. Now, we're gonna hopefully Palms so I don't know if they want to follow them. But you know, Ricky told us watching so we're walking and we stopped for sometimes like we're stopping. We're like, okay, we're going to stop here watched you and they move and keep going and then at a point I go there they are. ER let's go there they're walking and the lady goes to us and she goes that's not funny. Don't do that. I was like, what are we doing?	0.0
And like okay, I'm standing there looking at this lady.	1.0
Like what are you what what are you so a minute later like okay. I guess we'll go but then we're about to keep falling and then me and Dave go back to the lady and we have to explain why what we were doing because I think she thought we were going to like kidnap them.	0.0
It was it was it was he told me that Like after he was talking to the lady like after we explained the we're walking away and I'm like, so what just happened because I'm still trying to confuse. He's like, oh the lady thought we were going to kidnap them and I was like, oh, well, yeah, that's definitely not what was happening is not going to wish that was there for that. But yeah, we we left the mall would go to a store down the street real quick.	0.0
Yeah. Okay. So, um, I think that's enough for funny stories. We got pretty into that one.	1.0
I think we should move on to our what I want to make fun of something real quick. Okay. So in Boston, they approved that heterosexual afraid the straight Pride Parade, like look, I'm straight and without saying anything that would get anyone upset. I understand why you know gay people I sexual and all the LGBT community are so you know kind of I don't want to say in your face, but also they're in your face about it not I'm not saying that in a bad way or anything. I don't want it like offend anyone but you know, they struggled for their rights for a long time and they finally, you know fun. selves equals and so they got afraid, you know, cool. They got a month cool puts out. The straight people are like we wanna pray. Yeah, we straight people definitely need to make up for all the Discrimination we faced over the years.	1.0
Yeah, the other thing is you seen a gamer movement going around - they're doing really yellow for gaming but I think yeah because you know, I guess gamers are being discriminated discriminated against Idol. I don't know how that works. But yeah, so if you guys want to support the Gaming Community, you know, just change your profile picture to yellow and there you go. You're supporting The Gaming Community. Okay. So after we were going to go on to our next topic after their hetero parade and Go funny stories funny stop Thomas you want to talk about that Mouse thing because you know get a little bit of curious. Okay. So this is actually something that I just thought everyone should know if you haven't been keeping up with like science part of the news because I don't think that's I don't know if it's right up under shown on or anything like real news yet, but scientists have been working with a with a gene editing tool called. Crispr has nine and you can edit things and fix things and they were able to make they're able to do things and like they were able to basically cure HIV in most mice that had it because you know, they they got mice that had HIV and erotic. Okay. Now we're going to try to get basically get rid of so they use crisper and they're able to get rid of HIV so their plan now is to try it out on humans and see if that works and I mean I mean, that's one of the biggest steps.	1.0
I think that's got it ever got to be one of the biggest steps towards keyring a therapy.	1.0
Yeah, so I I know yeah, I know that we got from like a serious like a funny thing, but I just thought it'd be nice to talk about some interesting fact to know.	1.0
Yeah, so for any but I hope for the next few years. I mean I'd predict.	1.0
Five to ten years.	1.0
I have found a way to actually cure HIV and if we manage to do that, that'd be one of the biggest advancements in modern medicine.	1.0
I mean, it'd be almost as big as like curing cancer cure diabetes or any other like actually what they're doing with like Crispers they want to use it to cure cancer to so they've been working with that to cure like one cancer and stuff.	1.0
So yeah, there's that. I'm in you know, 20 years from now cancer. HIV diabetes all these other, you know polio all these other, you know genetic or sexually transmitted or You know any kind of disease like that 10 help me stop death sentence and even still today is almost a death sentence.	0.0
I'm like getting a cold. Yeah, like whoops. I caught AIDS again. Let me take my S Family Guy would put a let me take my Nyquil cold flu and AIDS pill now, we have two topics on the board still to talk about what thing about talking about some sports and working about talking about climate change. I don't know if we'll get the climate change or get too much into it, but I'm really research too much on it right now so late. It's a serious affecting topic. I think what we're going to do for most of our podcast is we're going to start. With like what we want to talk about get like that. We'll probably move into some funny topics some little game show in the middle and then move into some serious topics at the end. I don't know and put in as though it's good to write.	0.0
Yes that I want to run by you guys like right now on the podcast so that we can like us ask what like their opinion would be.	1.0
I like depends on whether It depends on where the watching these. It's going to be on like eight different platforms it automatically uploads to those so I can't tell you if I'll see all the comments. But if I happen to see some most of those comments then cool. If not, then sorry guys, but I didn't get to see your comments.	0.0
But yeah, so so here's my idea is right. Okay, I love them through and entertainment like movies TV shows talk about what's going on in that range of things. Straight talking about like what movies are doing good movies aren't doing good that kind of thing. And then my second idea is music. Like the music realm I guess we could get into music to an extant has that is definitely the other things going on in the wrap in the rap culture right now, like not even just rap.	1.0
There's other thing. I know it sounds like I'm just saying yeah, we'll look into that one.	0.0
For example, the grass is on top. Freaking little knives ex he's gay.	0.0
Yeah. Yeah.	1.0
I saw that the other day crazy. I was like, oh my God as his horse isn't the only thing he's riding on an Old Country Road.	0.0
I mean, I mean good for him. He has the courage to like come out about them.	1.0
So I I'm all for it. But I swear if he starts talking about right something else. I'm out. Yeah. No, I'm a very had the courage to come all I don't want to say anything that would offend anybody. But yeah, I mean good for him as long as he's happy that their else that's really old is I don't really care that he's gay like I like I don't really care. I don't really care like I'm still gonna listen to his music but like I'm saying if he starts rapping about like some fruity stuff like Yeah, that's gonna change his fan base is gonna look like very lot of like little 12 year old like little little like kids that listen to his music because their parents are not going to let them listen to that kind of stuff.	0.0
I don't know. I feel like caring for more like the our society nowadays is not as strict as it used to be so I mean, I don't see not a strict but there's a lot more accountability.	0.0
I mean it Oh, I thought it was cell phones now and it's everything has a lot more urgency to it.	0.0
Yeah. Yeah, then sure.	1.0
Let's talk about that just happened today was Thomas York your quote that you live by not really a quote but somehow I mean we could we could do whatever we could.	1.0
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that'd be great thing. We can have that in them. All right. Um, so do you guys want talk about climate change you want to talk about sports or you want to leave climate change? Our next podcast.	1.0
I don't know what you guys I think we should leave climate change and sports for next podcast so that we have something to start out with. Yeah.	1.0
Can we do you want to go into sports though and just do that just because it'd be weird.	0.0

Are you guys hiring instead? We got our food we were hanging out, you know acting a little dumb because you know, that's what guys do when they're with other guys. We really love doing but we weren't doing like we weren't doing really like it wasn't bad like we it was considerable to just like really separate. The out here who writes on the table on accident.

Do you guys want a job and we were but not a manager asked us the man manager asked us if we wanted a job. - yes, do you want to dump you in we thought it was for one of us, right?	1.0

Say hi everybody and we have our special guest call the wolf or the big bad cold Wolf cast. How you doing call.	1.0
Hey, what's up everybody your Legend Cole. Well, that's a good thing or a bad thing. I don't know.	1.0
It's a great thing. We knew it all along.	1.0
We have gotten together to and we're heading responded to an ask on Tumblr and we got an ask to have cold that will find he create so thank you. Yay. Whoo. And so let's start. How did you even get involved in this mess of a fandom for?	1.0
Um, I remember it was back during the first season when it was episode 9 the scene where Styles pushes Derek are Derek bushes. Stiles up against the door, and I thought that they were going to kiss but they didn't so then I kind of just dropped the whole thing didn't really think anything of it and then in like 2012. I got Tumblr and I saw like a piece of fan art for Styles and Derek and I was like, oh there are other people who thought the same thing that I thought so then I checked the stair tag, and this was back when like there was like three pieces of like fan art and like a few little pose. And then I found out about shipping and fandom and like before that. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know what shipping was and like steric was like my first Fick and then I just kind of just stayed in the fandom as if that's the show went on in the guns like season 2 when Jeff was like talking about steric more on Twitter back when he had a Twitter. He wasn't scared to talk to us.	1.0
I will say the fact that you said that because I know for a while like I think you still have a post in the archives.	1.0
It's like Jeff Davis is a genius and remember us all being Bamboozled for like a good while but him I have so many posts and like probably tweets that were like, I remember just like a while ago like a few months ago. I found like an old tweet of mine that was like Jeff wouldn't do steady eye. He knows that it's not going to work he is not Down he's a good writer. He would never do that. It's like the foolishness the ignore my God I had for this man.	1.0
I totally remember that the period of time where I was like, oh he's so great and people just need to leave them alone and back off. You have a lot of pressure from the network let the man work and all that stuff like that, but we'll took it to another level like we have the whole Jeff Davis has a gift hashtag.	1.0
And that's where Jeff Davis is not a gift. And Jeff Davis is a dick came from which I love.	1.0
So when did you first realize that you had the coal the wolf reputation?	1.0
Um, I don't know the exact moment. I feel like it was some sort of like obscure moment. Like I would post something and we get a lot of like notes fairly quickly. I felt like I knew I don't know. Maybe it was Posey gate with the whole like telling Posey's mom on me and like right now I don't like go through so much. Effort for a fan obviously.	1.0
I had some sort of leg effect on the fandom or like some sort of power that I had what else I do have a question how involved were you when it came to stare at campaign and sitting in Clinton that whole thing. Were you kind of cool with them at some point or was it always kind of standoffish?	1.0
Um, I mean, I was friendly with them. I wasn't like part of like the group though. Like they were big-name fans and I was a big name fan but I was like off sort of on my own. They think like I contributed to like the different events that they did but I wasn't like in like the planning or in that group at all.	1.0
So I would just another fan outside of that I think because when I when I was doing my research I'm back in the day. I kept hearing about oh called The Wolf he's evil and he's terrible at I'm like really seems fine to me. He loves Derek's or why not and started doing just some digging and I noticed that the second that people started talking to you and by people, I mean industry people insiders people involved with the show. That's when things kind of started to go sour on the steric side, and I think That that 100% is because of jealousy basically and then they're like, well, you know who's pulling him stuff? Why does he get to know anything and that's usually kind of how that starts.	0.0
Yeah. I think there's a huge misconception that is sterics. We have were like this huge Juggernaut that's cohesive and there really are many factions within steric. Who? Oh, yes each have their own idea of what a steric and what is acceptable and yeah, well you should be	1.0
Well, I remember I forgot what year it was, but it was in December of one year that I was talking to the people from the after-show and back then I think Steph was kind of like you're not supposed to talk about it. Like it was already starting to get to that point but it wasn't as bad as it got with the rest of the show because they wanted me to get on that show. Show and I was talking to like the people behind that and I was supposed to be on that show and then it kind of stretched a few months. Like I was supposed to be on in December and then that got rescheduled there was some sort of like internal problem with the filming or whatever. So then it was rescheduled to like March or something. And then when we got to March it was like, oh, you know this guy handed off to different people like different Executives that took control over it and then I was kicked off. Then they got whoever I don't know. Who else.	0.0
Okay, so we need to talk about that. This is what I'm so funny because I had completely forgot that happen. But that is actually how I think I got to know you and so I really do think that that was the turning point because that's when people are like Lenin he doesn't even like the show he just loves staring. Why would they invite him on and I remember cuz the very first guest Was Not Another Teen Wolf podcast test and then they had the Argent crew then I forget who was on after that. It was an artist was it not dot but Kendra. Okay. I can't remember her artist named Klaus some Kendrick laws something like that. It's like oh, yeah, right and it was all leaning very much one way. And so when there was kind of, you know thoughts of like, oh, let's have someone who's going Hysteric on like who are they going to choose? Who are they going to choose? I don't know that people were talking about it. But I think at that point that's when you kind of start with like, you know, I was kind of told XYZ and that's kind of where that all sparked it, but that's hilarious. I completely forgot about that.	1.0
And then I remember it exactly how messy that was what it was because I remember the interview because I had a scheduled like webcam interview with two of the people. All that were in charge of that and they just like ask me a bunch of questions. So they've asked me like who's your favorite character? When did you start watching the show? What is your favorite thing about the show and literally my favorite character was Styles. I started watching the show when it first started airing like the very first episode I tuned in and I told them like my favorite part of the show is steric and they were like, why is that, you know, your favorite part of the show and I explain to them why I liked the two characters together and like Part of what shipping was like I gave them kind of like a like Outsider kind of information. So I didn't go into like depth as to what it was and they seem fine with it. Like they didn't seem like shocked they're like hesitant and then of you went fine, and then I guess I got handed down to the other people who were like no, but they did have a steric on they had it right when they changed president's yeah. They had a guy. Who was supposed to be doing like a game like a video game? Yes, and I never happen. I wonder why they probably got shut down or something and they were like you can't make this even though it was going to be like out of his own time and again nothing to do but the show but that game never came out. But I remember he had like video footage of like the first like be getting up. Game, yeah and looked fine. Like I was excited for it, but it never came out.	1.0
So Teen Wolf is a bunch of promises that never get fulfilled just like the the you Kimora spin-off the young Derek spin-off, you know this podcast hilarious, you're like the podcast.	1.0
None of them are voice actors, like the only one who could probably do it is Dylan and he's not going to be a part of that.	1.0
That so that was the best part of the interview. Did you remember that interview where they were like, he was like, oh, there's going to be a thing of Team. Oh, yeah. He was can guarantee you I will not 100% not be involved don't hurt him.	1.0
But I heard I'm not gonna let them use my name anymore. Am I gonna see you? Imagine if they had really gotten off the ground? They would have been flashing his face everywhere, even if he wasn't Signed on to it. No, definitely.	1.0
Yeah, but the only thing that we did miss out on in a naughty sent me this in actually reminded me of it is originally if they had gotten a season 7 Scott was supposed to pass off somehow. I don't know what the logic behind it is, but he was supposed to pass off his Alpha to Liam so that Liam could take care of Beacon Hills while he was at school. And so I'm like does that He's not an alpha anymore. Like he's just gonna give it up. You know, it's just so crazy. But then Alex was going to be the new Teen Wolf and then they were going to you know, do this whole 2.0 thing and I remember Jeff talking about that. And so I'm like if the aunties knew that Scott wasn't the office and he gave it to a white boy I would die and I wanted to happen. It's Canon as far as I'm concerned.	1.0
I mean they really I mean if they were going to do it, they really should have passed it off to a girl.	1.0
Oh 100% a girl of color. Like honestly at this point because they're yeah, they just got real trifling towards the end. They started all white and they ended all white. It's just like come on y'all for this, you know Place free of racism homophobia.	0.0
Okay. So Scandal wise like by this time when you were having like issues with that interview and you're already having a little bit of blowback Scott stands or rampant during this time, right? Look, I can't even remember.	0.0
Um, because I don't remember what the year that that happened.	1.0
I think I was still it had to be 13 was it had to be 2013 because it was before Posey gate. It was me. I'm 20 show Right exactly and that 2013 would have been is that when 3A was airing I think February 13th 2013 was one that Posey gate happened right bizarre burst with their 1400 Posey gate was 2014.	1.0
I believe it.	1.0
So this was like before this like a year before because because him coming out his lamp was 2015. So yeah, I'm thinking it had to be 2013. Is it would have been when 3A was airing and I know that's when people were still excited but also being like we're steric though.	1.0
Yeah, you're right Teen Wolf was February 2005. There's armor Twisted was February 2014 and which was when 3B was airing it is so then what happened with call would have been well three a was airing hmm probably. At that time you said like butts it was different back in the day. Right? Like it wasn't just the loud voice got stands that we have right now. It was like packs of them, right?	1.0
I almost feel like they were quieter. Like I don't commend ourselves. They were more I think hesitant to say anything like they said things obviously, but they were so quiet. Down by the fact that the show talked about steric the actors talked about steric. We talked about steric. They were kind of off like they didn't have any sort of voice to that. They would come up occasionally and like different things and like complain but I feel like the required or back then they got louder sort of as the show started turning against Eric.	1.0
Well, you know the turning point it what they were quieter, but it was because the show was supporting steric a at that point still and so as soon as bizarre weird Twisted happened just like with the stupid election, they became emboldened and we're like very just going to spread our hey, I do want to talk more about the poses mom thing and of course, you know, there is a bit of sensitivity to the issues since she has passed but I thought that that was so foul. And that's really if anything that got me. Twisted and what steric was actually about it was that because that was dirty on another level when it came to the Scott stands and they're like for them to go to her and then be like, well he say he made death threats against your son never happened and they're just like, why would you tell her that and then of course, she's like, oh who's this whole the wolf person she needs to get along just completely clueless and like okay, Mom. AMA lecture, but it was just so it's just thing that's kind of happening that kind of happened with Megan Tandy that still really upsets me is that like they go to her specifically to turn them against us when it's like we don't have a problem with you.	0.0
Yeah. I remember specifically with posies mom thing because I don't even know that she was like involved with Twitter and then I got a bunch of messages that Oh my God, you know she's talking about you blah blah blah and then I went and checked I think people like especially the aunties were expecting me to like attack her because I was very like I was very like loud and like if you say something I'm gonna say something to you, but I wasn't going to like fight with this like woman. She doesn't understand what's happening. All she thinks is that her son is getting like a tact and so she's just coming to His defense like I'm not gonna like argue with her something and I said something like that was like I'm not gonna argue with her or say anything mean to her. She's just a mom were looking out for her child, whatever and I was kind of the end of that and then it came out that like she was hacked or something like they hacked her account to do all this. I was just like how desperate are you to start like drama?	0.0
Whoa, wait they hacked her account. I think I get the message to her about you.	1.0
I don't know if they hacked her account to get the message or they hacked her account to like tweet things about me.	1.0
Yeah, because there were a bunch of deleted tweets after that and I don't know because we have screencaps of her initial response, but then there were more that were deleted and I think that's where the Hat came in at. Yeah.	1.0
I mean those people I mean they were always crazy. I mean remember when Studios got busted for hacking Pole or I think that that was funny.	0.0
That was I remember when we had to study a versus steric pole and yeah, they someone was running Bots and then like girls were crying and they're like, I made my mom boat 96.	1.0
It's like a sis every time that we like for the most part that we would occasionally lose but it would be like loss to like destiel. What exactly if it's outside of the yeah, but we also beat them a few times in different polls and like knows Madness was everything there was no ship and to move that ever came close to being able to beat like it would be like it would be steric versus like studio and we would win and then like the studios would be like, okay new poll, here's stare and here's there and it would be like only like to study a fancy.	1.0
They could win and it's like this isn't even ours long know the best one was someone tried to post a steric versus D'Elia versus stadia because the studio thought that the sterics were going to be split and then it would just be steady all the way but I'm like no you instantly are going to be split. So just like as soon as we started dominating someone hit that delete button. This is like, oh what happened what happened to the pole?	0.0
Messy, what's the one Tumblr Scandal? I hit you like the most they either with personal or like you just got really angry when I had it for a while.	0.0
Um, it was probably I feel like the one that was angry was when I was like livid at the show, which was after the still Leah episode and I can house When doused Eric wasn't going to happen and all of this craziness was happening was there is what was it called? Um, so it was the collective that Teen Wolf People we're going to create like their own Tumblr called the collective and they were going to upload like you could upload pictures of fan art and whatever and it was so obvious like they were only going to include hetero Actual fan art like they weren't going to allow / shipping and it was just a way for them to like control their fandom like the Teen Wolf and um, and I got a message from somebody who like I can't reveal who they are, but they worked with like this system. It was like listen you have influence amongst the Teen Wolf and mm based on like how popular you are and you have a voice if you speak out. Out against this it will like stop the Teen Wolf people from trying to do whatever it is that they're doing and so they were like you can write a post and just like tell the fandom don't you know mess with this Collective crab don't you know join this? Yes, just you know a way for them to control the fandom and then I like I've looked at like their terms of service or whatever and it was like if you upload a piece of fan art, they You can complete control of that own it own it to like do whatever it is that they want to do with it. So I just formulated this giant post and then I think I uploaded like I posted it before the collective even dropped. So like it was before like it got announced that it was gonna be like into like for like usage. So I uploaded it and people just went crazy over it saying I'm not using this. This is crap blah blah blah and then the piece ER guy who worked at the time for the Teen Wolf PR like ranted on it and like sub tweeted me and he said he said something like like I hate when people who don't know what they're talking about come in and ruin something that you've been working on for like months and I'm like, well, sorry, we all know who that guy was and he still trash to this day.	0.0
But I mean, let's talk about the level of padding things like multiple people associated with Move I've gotten Petty with fans to a level. I don't think I've really used to I mean, I think the only thing that comes close is like Steven Universe, but like I heard that been in what kind of aren't it was a Steven Universe or Voltron Voltron Voltron where you know, there was a huge class between the Show creator people of people involved with the show and fandom and they actually kind of went back and forth with each other, but that was later. So like before Teen Wolf, I don't really remember that happening. Often enough for people to find out about it.	0.0
I feel like it didn't happen with like fandom because I felt like there was a census that I've heard of of like creators trying to ban fanfiction and trying to like copyright strike fan fiction from people because you know, it wasn't their Vision or whatever but I feel like at least for me Teen Wolf was the instant of them like actively trying to like hurt fans and like Do it publicly right that it was like, okay.	0.0
Well then just think about remember at sdcc where they had that thing where they were reading the fan fiction. And in fact, that's kind of how we originally got involved with Edie and we were actually on her side because she was like that was disgraceful like they had him reading this big but it was purely to make fun of it and purely the laugh at the author was fine, but it was like still that's not a good look. Yeah. Yeah and And then that on top of Jeff's whole thing that Linden let slip where Jeff was like, you know, they told us no, in fact, I think Hoechlin even said it in an interview in Dillon to maybe we've been like don't look at any of the fan art don't look at any of the fanfic. I'll do that. I'll take care of that for you. I'll respond to that for you. You don't have to deal with that and I was just like side I now for the collective that what so the reason people found out about it. Is because a few people were invited to start adding their stuff to open it up and so the link and if there wasn't an announcement yet in the link wasn't public but just kind of threw, you know DM's and that kind of stuff people were beginning to know what it was. So when your post came out because I already thought it was shady. So in your post gave out we were like, oh, yeah, it's definitely Shady Shady boots, but like I think because like the big-name	0.0
Ann's in the fandom would get like we would get messages and like diems from people who are Anonymous who were like with the show and like there was instance where people from the show would like give us spoilers of like what's going to happen and it would be like written in a very vague kind of way but like you can get like the just of it and then when like the show kind of started turning against Eric, we would still get or at least I did we Get messages from like inserts in the show of like ways to like be one step ahead of like their mess. It's to like actively post about it. So that way when it came out fans will like already like in the know like fans already knew what the mess was going to be like had a way to like prepare for just how shitty the show was which was weird. Like I want to know who these people were who were like on the side of the fandom and not on the Side of the show like who like who would risk their job to do that? It didn't make sense. Here.	0.0
He is the Beast somebody and I think that that's why because ultimately I think one of the reasons especially what what do we want to call them Timmy Mick em. He I think one of the reasons he was petty is because we didn't see Whatever. He was told the big picture was he couldn't show us the big picture and so all he saw was us being very upset and rightfully, so but instead of being like Oh, no, you're rightfully upset is just like will screw it. You know, you guys don't know what you're talking about and it's like yeah, we don't know and that's the problem is that we're reacting to this nonsense that you guys are throwing at us. I remember when we interviewed Chantal love her love her love her, but we are you know, Did you ever talk about steric onset? And she was like no, nope. Nope, never know and it was just like and then we asked her like who do you ship and she's like, oh, yes, Derek and never talked about it. All right, never ever ever never on set. You know, and I was like, I don't they're still a timeline of leadership that I'm very interested in it and that show because I was I was contacted which was interesting. Maybe because it was late. It was like 2015 but it was by a lawyer who used to work on the show. And so, you know just got some general Dietz that way because you know, he didn't have anything new of course, but the idea that yeah, there were these malls and you could see it sometimes in the writing but the problem was in trying to help us they ended up mucking up the cannon and mucking up the it even more because it's like I would kind of rather just have it Crash and Burn and just be mad at it than having these little things pop up or like oh wait, is that something and it's not them it wasn't them trying to give us hope but it was more like we see you.	0.0
We know, you know that kind of thing, but it's so interesting and like confusing because like during season 4 like sterics were not like we were not here for I didn't even watch these in for I watched literally the finale and only the finale because I got information that there's going to be a big steric moment in it. And I was told like there could be a hug or a kiss which there wasn't a hug or a kiss but it was a big steric moment and it was like, why is the show actively trying to like kill steric but then have a moment like that where you have Derek dying and so many different like the he was going back to Styles over and over and over again. Like she'll why is that in the show like who put that in there if you guys hated so much which I have wooden table fan.	0.0
Yeah, when we were in the beginning it was like romantic mood lighting display.	1.0
Like I don't understand that like it doesn't make sense to me why that was put in the show when it they actively tried to like tear steric apart.	0.0
At the time I had this like very innocent idea what was going on that these were just kind of like fan moments given like spread out throughout the show just to be like, oh we see the kind of like things that we see you, but obviously we're gonna go there but now that I'm looking back on it. It just looks like they put in those moments to string us along. Yeah, but it worked enough that some people were strongly strung along enough that they went to the end.	0.0
But the thing that's what I was thinking.	1.0
Yeah. Well, that's what I was talking about in terms of undesired consequences. The thing that we have to realize about a show is that you have the showrunner you have the writers, but then you also have the director and you have the editors specifically the editors. Those are going to be the ones are like, oh this shot and then he's going to look at him. They don't like him, you know, and they do kind of work in tandem, but each one. Those people have their own motive and I think what we caught in was this person's like who's Derek? I'm gonna you know, they're not going to do on the show. I'm going to slip this in for the fans ha ha ha and then you have the people like, oh well slip in a little steric and kind of string along the fans and then you have someone's like no staring and so it's just this mishmash of all these different motives and it makes it entirely confusing because you also have to remember that by season for we're dealing with Shelly. They either made a huge mistake or someone was really exposing but there was a storyboard release of their ideas. It was like an outline for season 3 be specifically for 320 and on that board. It said Styles mom, but it did and it was like in small letter. So something that you could tell that they weren't really expecting people to pick up but specifically there was no mention of Malia no mention of Shelley nothing. And so it's like you give Holland talks about used to talk about getting the scripts the same day and I'm like you have a period of time that is specifically for writing. Yeah, what is happening that you're giving scripts the same day of shooting what's going on in here? What's this mishmash?	0.0
And I think that's the part that we don't get I'm still like because I'm still confused about 320 and I've talked to people behind the scenes have Nation about this and I mean Dylan already came out he went to Alpha Kane. He just like dragged Jeff for riding in the sex scene and he talked about how there was supposed to be like a moment with Stiles is Mom. But specifically for like that episode there was talk about how Dylan was confused as to why it was going in the direction that it was going so suddenly and made absolutely no sense and because Like there was well there was talk about the how there was supposed to be steric and how it there was going to be a build-up to steric. It was actually going to happen and that there was like plans and there was agreement and contracts between certain actors to like build it up whatever and that it just all shifted randomly for no reason, which I still don't know about it still don't know the information. There's still missing pieces that just nobody need to talk to anymore because nobody's connected to the show.	0.0
They kicked excellent kick rocks only person used to be involved with the show that talks about anymore. We'll try it it for like a week and then I think he got another job and he was like by and then but except for Jeff who makes a lot of you know things about shows he's never going to make and then Eric occasionally and only because they bought that stupid	0.0

But again, we don't know who influenced what and ultimately because Jeff was gone for a minute and I'm pretty sure Jeff was fired for a minute and but it was right at the same time as a like. The crossover where the change in leadership because LJ is Lindsay Jewett Sturman. She was in charge of season 5 for the most part. She took Jeff's notes and then really kind of cobbled that together and then they announced that season six was Jeff's last they got Hall age, which I'm like y'all paid out the but for this and then you know Season 6, so I'm like this wasn't a someone was doing him a favor.

How are you?	1.0
I'm doing awesome. It's always good to see you. And I know we say that all the time that we get to see each other when we do this and we hope you guys enjoy our conversations. We've had a blast doing these and we're just having fun sharing ideas and getting your feedback. So thank you to all of you who are listening and sharing them out. We appreciate it.	1.0
So today we're going to talk about a subject the subject of kindness we I know that you know as teachers we are hopefully modeling kindness and our classroom kindness on the playground kindless with our peers kindness with their peers because the students the students are looking at you they're noticing you they're watching you and so I was reading an article the other day and found not an unsurprising but it's still a little bit of alarming statistics about what teachers are seeing in their classroom teachers are reporting about a 30% increase in bullying or unkind Behavior being displayed over the last couple of years. It's not surprising but it's still alarming. I think it's not surprising because we are seeing more bullying type of behavior or unkind Behavior through different types of social media channels the way people interact with each other and so students are noticing children are noticing what they're seeing and it's coming back into our classroom. So I thought today would be a great time to talk about kind. This how we how do we Foster kindness in her classroom? And Adam is first of all, one of the kindest people. I know I'm not just saying that because he's staring at me like I totally feel that way and if you've met him before I know that you agree, but he also does some really specific things in his classroom to help Foster that kindness and so I thought maybe Adam you could speak to that.	1.0
Well, yeah then thank you for that. I you know, I'm I don't know how to respond to that. I appreciate that more than you know, don't get me wrong. I have my share of demons. My closet as well and there are people who know that I can I'm a big believer in in sharing your feelings regardless of what because that's how people get to know you. So yes, I try to be the kindest person possible and I hope that I am especially with students. I always am but let's be honest. We all have our moments right? I definitely want to wear my heart on my sleeve. That's why I have a tattoo of a heart stone on my wrist because I do but no, I really appreciate that more than you know, and and I can't take total credit for For my I guess philosophy or attitude or just believe on this subject it stemmed from well. First of all, my upbringing I was raised by the best parents in the world and completely always surrounded by Family transition that to school. I had some of the best teachers in the world. I was lucky enough to go to a very very small school. So everybody knew everybody, you know your teachers Knew by first middle and last name then your family. I was raised in a kind World, which I think a lot of people our age were and unfortunately, Times have changed like you said times are changing and times are changing in and I'm a big believer that no one was was inherently born as an unkind human being it's something you're taught. It's something that you've experienced. It's what you were surrounded by on a daily basis and my goal. Our goal is to Decatur's should be to reverse that statistics and get it back to you know, I don't know just get the world to be one happy place. I know that sounds so cliche and and cool, but Then moving forward I guess to go back into my philosophy. And reason for this stemmed from a woman who was my mentor teacher and I know I've told this story before on multiple platforms and media devices and want to hear it again.	1.0
I wanna hear it again.	1.0
It's something I never get sick of telling because because I love this lady with all my heart. So when I started teaching I moved two and a half hours away from home. I knew like obviously my wife's family. That's but that's all I knew up here. I didn't know any teachers. I know nothing about the school Trish and I I moved to a town near her hometown. So we were near her family and I started this job at an amazing team that took me in there under their wings and we just we got along super great and we just had a blast together. And at the time we were a team of three teachers and I kept hearing these stories about this teacher who was now in the junior high level. Her name was honor Trotter and she had taught kindergarten. Actually. My room was her kindergarten room before I came and I got to know honor a little bit over the first couple years of teaching because she was doing A junior high like I don't science work, but she's also doing reading Specialists work on our end. So my kids got to go see her every now and then and I just I would spend my break. I know that seems like a weird word and education so we don't really get those but my break with my students would actually get time as a class to go see honor in Reading tight like that await a specific dedicated reading block that she got to take kids and do awesome activities. I found myself not taking a break but sitting and watching her and I was amazed at the way this woman taught and II guess our school didn't really have an official Mentor program at the time but I considered her my mentor because I learned more from her than I ever did from any textbook or any course I ever took and it it wasn't just about teaching it was just about the way she interacted with with not just students but human beings and I use that term a lot when I go out and speak that we need to treat these people in our classrooms and our lives not as students that are walking through a door. But his people is anybody else wants to be treated, you know, so I learned a lot from her on that subject and then When she was close to retirement, she actually came back to kindergarten she joined our kindergarten because our numbers were growing and she went to our board and our Administration said listen. I know you're going to be hiring kindergarten. Please. Let me finish up my career there where I started and of course they were like, yeah, let's do it. So I want to say I don't remember the number off the top of my head, but maybe the last five six seven years of her career were spent in kindergarten and I got to be a part of her team. It was it was awesome. We were team before for a while then a team of five them sema4 went back and forth, but it was always Myself, my neighbor Tiffany and Lori who were my three what I started and then honor it was always the four of us plus another 1 or minus another one and honored just to just was just an awesome person in the working with and getting to learn from her and then two years before she was about to retire. She was kind of forced into early retirement because she was diagnosed with cancer that forced her to stop teacher Chic. She had to take care of herself as she was weakening. She only made it about nine months. After she was diagnosed and I'll never forget when she called me up one day. I still remember I was laying on my couch watching a movie phone rings. It was like a Saturday and it was her and she was he come over for a minute and she lived like a half hour from where I live. So it's like yeah. Yeah, like what what's up, you know and my daughter was I think to at the time so she was probably napping and I just looked at Trisha. I'm like I need to go to honors house and she's like for what it's like I really don't know and I knew that she had been out and having some medical issues. I didn't know that it was going to be big and she sits me down a couch and tells me that she has cancer and of course as anybody would I lost it I started crying and I didn't know what to think and she didn't shed a tear. She's smiling at me and I looked at him like what are you doing? Like, how are you know said she goes she goes I've cried out of my I cried when I got the diagnosis, but she goes I've learned to accept the fact that there's a reason that I have cancer and and how it blew my mind. I mean, I probably jaw dropped look they're like, what do you mean there's a reason like no, there's no For a reason for this and she truly was the most hopeful person in the world. She believed that there was a purpose to her being diagnosed with cancer and I know the stories going on. I apologize for rambling but there's a point to this there really is. So I guess the point this is that that there was never specific lesson from her that she came out and said this is the way you should be treating people or here's a lesson on kindness or here's a lesson on bullying or is she there was never a specific thing that I recall a my mind at all it started with that moment when she Said to me there's a purpose for this and at that time I had no idea that it was becoming it was I had no idea. I mean no one thought she's gonna pass away as fast. She did we just we didn't really know and then when we lost honor we never got to find out what she thought her purpose was, right? So honored passed away nine months after diagnosis, May 6th of 2013 and the week after her funeral or that actually three days after she passed away was her birthday birthday is May 9th and on that day our entire Will went out back and we bought I don't remember how much I think we bought 60 because it was gonna be on her 60th birthday on May 9th. We bought 60 yellow balloons and released them one of our past PE teachers who had taught With Honor for 30 plus years brought little yellow bracelets to the school for everyone like rubber bracelets, you know that said honoring Honor on them. She given to every student staff member like thousands of these bracelets were headed out and I just remember being out on this lawn with our entire School telling stories of her microphone. Everybody got to kind of share their story about honor that was close to her. We sang Happy Birthday. We let these balloons go and and something about that day and the I don't have image the balloons were yellow honors favorite color was yellow. So that's the reason for the yellow balloons the yellow bracelet. She just loved the color yellow and that day became an image. I guess that was etched into our school forever now because it's continued but so fast forward again, and that year went on we all made it. Through the school year a new year started and then things started to seem kind of weird as they would if you lost, you know a family member best friend are our building just didn't seem the same we knew she was still there, but we can still hear her laugh in the hallway. We knew she was there but something struck me as something I guess important in the fact that I needed to find a way or we as a team or a teacher group or a school need to find a way to keep her alive in our building as much as possible and to do that on my end. I mean, we've all done our own share of things of sharing her story of an item. High-end, I wrote a book about her and it was a book called yellow that Shameless plug here. You can find on Amazon or you know, you don't have to buy my book. You can go to my YouTube channel teachers learn to dot common and see a free video of me reading it to your class. So check that out. But anyway, I wrote this book as a way to keep her alive because I felt there were so many students and staff cheated out of getting to know her and I felt lucky that I got to write. So I wrote this book. I got to start traveling around to schools as an author of all things which Blew my mind because I just wrote this just for her, you know sharing honor story. And the reason that was brought up was because her story was all about just making people happy and there's a line on the book that says Honor made people's gray skies into yellow Skies or turn people's gray skies and yellow skies because that's what she did and it wasn't. I mean, I know there's so many kindness campaigns out there then they're all great, but hers wasn't about doing anything for anyone. It wasn't about doing a random act of kindness. It was more so that she got people to realize the good in. Side themselves just like being the person she was and I know that sounds kind of confusing but I don't know how she did it. But she made you feel like the best person in her life. No matter what it was and she just found a way to make everybody smile and make you very happy. Yeah, and that's the kind of kindness that she spread was just getting other people to feel good. It wasn't going out of her way to do anything. She was just that type of human being she made everybody feel special special. Yeah an important and noticed, you know, And she made you feel good about yourself. She brought out something in me that I don't know. I'd ever experienced before you know, so I keep saying this but fast forward again and I think three or four years after she had passed away we decided to keep her birthday celebration going but even more and Anna term had come up from my book called make someone's day yellow and we just kept using that over and over again in our building would skip say to make someone's day LSA make someone's day yellow today rather than saying like pay it forward. We just said make someone's day yellow And we decided to do that. So we on May 9th three years ago, four years ago. Whatever. The first one was. We decided to celebrate honors birthday at our school with what we call Yellow day and we did just kind things all day long. We decorate our entire school to look yellow. I mean balloons streamers posters. Everything was turned yellow we did do random acts of kindness for people around the building. So we delivered like flowers to the secretaries and just rope notes to teachers and random people saying smile today are hope you have the best day ever. Or thank you for being you just things that honor would have done without really knowing them we decided to do purposefully, right and after it happened after yellow to happen. I videoed the whole thing. I put on my YouTube channel and about two weeks after the day. I got a message from a teacher and I look at the location. It was from Australia, and it blew my mind that someone lost really was even watching my little YouTube channel, right? I looked at the comment and said thank you for sharing this message. We're going to try to do a yellow day at our school and I I remember running to school the next day like oh my gosh you guys check this out someone in Australia is going to do our celebration like it's going to spread and then these emails and messages started coming in at one after another after another after another and and over the past three years of doing yellow day at our building and then spreading around other schools and other states and other countries we've hit I think eight different countries where we've seen yellow Day celebrated and 35 different states within the u.s. I can't count the number of schools that it's reached. The number of people it's reached but yellow day has become a movement is what we've used the term as As you know and going back to an honor was diagnosed and what this all meant. I truly believe that everything that happens in your life is done for a purpose whether you want to believe in a higher being or not or what your beliefs are. It doesn't matter to me. Everything happens for a reason. Let's not deny that fact there's a reason behind everything that happens and I never forget two years ago on the other day when it was really getting big and blowing up. We were getting messages from schools left and right and people post on social media like picture after picture after picture after picture. A bunch of us teachers were standing outside my classroom door talking and showing sharing images of images that we were tagged in after school. And one of our first grade teachers Donna walks by and she goes this is it Adam and I said, excuse me, and she is this is the purpose and I said, what do you mean and she goes this is why honor had cancer and I lost it like a probabilistic. I lost it. I'm like, oh my gosh, that's true. Like we never got to find out what honor believed her purpose for having cancer was until that day and we truly feel like her reason for being diagnosed.	1.0
Know'st was to start this movement and get people to realize the good another people and when there's one there are these horrible events that happen whether it happens to a person it happens to a building and happens to an area. It's hard to to see at the moment what that you know, where the good can come from it right? It's hard to see that because it just feels so awful. But I think that I think that what you're saying is we have to Look for look for the positive that can come from it. Even how painful that is. Look for that positive and then and take action as a result of what you see that that is DD an awesome way to say it and an awesome.	1.0
I'd recognize it and had I had you as a friend back then maybe I would have realized that I don't think any one of us really felt like we were doing anything for that. We just wanted to keep her memory alive, you know, kind of organically happened it did and luckily. We proudly it spread to what it has today.	1.0
I'm like still crying over the story. So if you do this, that's just me, you know being a worse but it's just um, it's a varied it's an extremely touching story and it is painful when you lose a staff member. So I'm thinking of so you have this yellow day and and you have this celebration of her life in May but leaving up to that time. What? Some of the things that you incorporate into your day into your way of interacting with your human beings, right one of the things that I'll share mine first and then maybe you could share something that you do is this is a really challenging thing to do. It's surprisingly challenging but as you go about your day and you run into 7-Eleven for your you know Snicker bar, not that that happened to me. I'm just saying, you know, I go in there for nothing but healthy things but you run into 7-Eleven. You and you grab something and you're checking out right? Look that person in the eye. It's really hard. It's a hard habit to get into and when they say, how are you how's your day? You know oftentimes your think I got to swipe my card. There's people behind me and I got to kind of find the right change, but we get in the habit of not looking at people when we talk to them or when we're in front of them. And and when that happens, I mean, I just think it becomes we become more disconnected. Even though we're surrounded by people. And so I think that one thing that can help is to become connected. So it's a habit. I'm trying to get better at and I have you know it Ebbs and flows like sometimes I'm better at it than others, but I noticed that I remember back going back to 9/11. So y'all, you know, I've been on this planet a long time some of you are like, oh, yeah, I was too and that happened. I remember when that happened and it was a very strange. couple of weeks strange and that you know one we didn't see our planes in the sky for a couple of days, but then when you would pass random strangers, I'm going to cry thinking about this but um, I'm getting it together here when you were passed random strangers on the street. They would look you in the eye and smile and and greet you which is very it's very different. If you're in a small town happens all the time. If you're in a large city doesn't happen ever like never nobody talks to you. I mean, you just kind of go about your day or base having their little mental conversations and they're going about their day. But for those two weeks we were connected and we were a kind. derp	1.0
Cry it out because you're right. It's unfortunate that it took something like that. Yeah right to make us realize how do I don't know to bring that out of people.	1.0
I don't know and I did it and I think that that Catalyst we never want to have that happen again, you know, we never want that to happen again, but I think we have to take that message of how we felt by connecting with people. I'm still crying y'all. And I'm going to make you talk now, but all right, but how we felt and bring that to our classroom. So as your students are coming in, you know greet. I know this is people say all the time but greeting them and then looking them in the eye those are kind of two different things. And so when you combine those two things is pretty powerful. Okay. I'm going to get my act together you talk now? Okay.	0.0
All right now and I'm so glad you mentioned that because this is something that not only we need to be doing with our students, but we need to be teaching to our students. That looking people in the eye and saying hello Yeah, and it's amazing to me how much that effect can have on someone and I'm probably overly do this. I probably had annoyed the heck out of people a big city because I do now that I've got the travel a lot more with my career in education the way it is now like I go to DC quite a bit I go to I was in New Orleans last week I go to some big cities, right? I make a point no matter where I'm at to to look at people and say hello, and I know that one. Our parents have told us like all the time don't talk to strangers. Don't talk to me. But why not? You know, I'm not saying go get in a conversation with someone and tell them everything about your life. But when you're walking past them on the street. Hello. Hi. How's it going? How are you? You know I say hi to every single random person I passed and I get some really dirty looks I get the shaking of the head. Like, why are you talking to me? But why not? You know, why not just say hello. I mean, it's a simple simple thing when you're walking through a Lobby of a hotel Or when you I don't know. I know it seems like it should go without saying right but the do it and I get that this is educated for reached out to you here and obviously we sincerely hope you're doing that your students every day. I know all you amazing educators are saying hello to your students when they come in every day. That's that should go without saying but teach that to them why not teach your students to start doing that around the building for starters, you know instead of don't tell them to go out and just talk to every stranger they meet but say hello to every single person that passes them in the hallway or or on the playground or at lunch or in the office or on the bus hallway, cause there's no talking in the hallway screwed.	1.0
I know what you're saying. I mean you are you know, and as teachers, you know, we can also model this and obviously honor did and I'm sure you are as well. But as we are walking in the hall and we see up here, you know make eye contact and smile and say good morning or good afternoon or or something like that. I think that you know, I I know that you know, I've been in a lot of schools to where you know, you have teachers to get together and you know, when you get a group of girls together, sometimes sometimes we're not so nice and but sometimes you know, you see this kind of get-together chat chat chat or a teacher will be having the students come in and another teacher will join in and ask a question. And then meanwhile, there's interaction students are watching that so if we are if we were showing kindness to whoever is here, or if that conversation is anything less than kind about maybe a little gossip going on right students are noticing this so Be the person you want to see in your classroom. And of course, there's all types of great books out there on kindness and being paying it forward and you know being a good human. So those are things that we're going to want to incorporate in our classroom, but I think reading the books and checking that off. The list is not enough right? It's not enough to show, you know, the person that we want to	1.0
Be alright, it's being it's been an example to indict and just letting your students watch you WEA know wholeheartedly these kids mimic every single thing we do. So imagine if if you smiled and said hello to every person across your path, you know, we talked to think in one of the previous episodes about getting kids to to learn the names of other staff members, right? And I mean, that's something that could be considered a kind act when you can call someone by name rather than just just waving or giving a head nod, you know, so that's a simple step. Inclusion is another big one and I don't mean on the the classroom inclusion of you know, different grade levels and abilities and it just including people in your everyday conversations. I just think that's an important lesson we can teach to all kids that we include people who might not feel included you'll see that in bullying statistics all the time. What if you know, what if what if what if one person had someone sit with him at lunch or that one person that someone sits on the playground so kindness as a whole can be stretched in Seoul The different directions and so many philosophies and so many ideas or things but it doesn't have to be the purchase of an item or an idea that your intently doing. It just just just be a good human being, you know, the way that the way that you would want to be treated, right?	1.0
I agree. I agree. I mean looking back at you know, my life just long so far, but when I look back in my life, you know, I know there's times when I wasn't the best person I could be you know, and any and those those moments, you know, if you know, you can't redo them, you know, there's times when I have been unkind I have either verbally been unkind or I've mentally been unkind and both of those things are you know things as humans, we you know, we got to deal with we got to recognize it but hopefully learn from it as well. And so, you know as we notice unkind things because it's going to happen in the classroom. We're Notice on kind things. Hopefully, that's the takeaway that students can can learn as yes, you know, this happened and and showing them how that's not the person they're going to want to grow up to be right. That's not the person and and when they can look at you you teachers out there and see that person who they're going to want to walk in your footsteps and hopefully that's the takeaway from today's episode.	1.0
Yeah. And I know you mentioned like there are things we can start doing now and that's really it just just beat that example. I do want to say as we gear up towards yellow days not until May right but Deedee you said it best like why wait till then start some things now and I think we've covered quite a few things my favorite part about this kind of talk to is that when I do this talk or this this conversation as a keynote when I go out and speak to schools. My favorite part is just seeing people now their heads, you know, like yeah. Yeah, that's a great act. Like I already do that and that sincerely that's my hope that These are things people are already doing maybe that's just reignites your idea that come across has try that or maybe I can do this for my students know really busy in the classroom.	1.0
We think of all the things we need to do and you know it, you know, like my resting face is not a good one. I'm just going to say right so I mean being aware of that or my thinking face know I'd had students got missiles. Are you mad I'm like no. I'm just thinking, you know, but it looks like a mat that is all looks the same sometimes but you know, we just be kind of aware of that we But we have a big to-do list as teachers, but I think at the top of that list should be make really good human beings.	1.0
I like that. Yeah, so we have a website going make someone's day yellow.com some of Didi and eyes amazing friends have shared some free products out there that on that site that you don't need to wait until yellow data use, they're just ideas about Sharing kindness and creating kind atmospheres in your classroom, I guess and just making the again. This is just about making the world a brighter place for other people. And by getting people to see the good inside themselves. So check that out and the best part about this is I've learned so many wonderful ideas from people like DeDe and another teachers who have come back and said, well we did this for the other day. We did this real day. We're doing this to gear up for you today. So, please please please as you share it this episode or share talk about this with your teachers share those ideas with us, you know, if you put something about kindness on social media that is related to to making the world brighter tag Didi and I in it and we want to hear your ideas to in. Yes, yellow day. Obviously, it's not my personal ID at all. It was it was a team idea that we started at our school. Obviously the books are my ID. And what I've done with the so far has been a culmination of ideas. I've learned from people. So yes while it's tied back to my name. I guess I don't want it to be that way at all. I want it to be a worldwide Global thing. So ours right is it's ours and I want those ideas to be spread and shared. So we love I say we because it is a community people that work this together. We love Of hearing ideas of ways to make make the world a brighter Place awesome.	1.0
Awesome. That's a good spot to end.	1.0
Is that that let's do it. Yeah, so be kind and we'll see you next time guys.	1.0
All right. Thanks. See you.	1.0
The people who dream and those people who dream big have a different kind of life than the people who don't drink. If you do not do what you're doing right now. Well, your goal is just going to be a fancy desire isn't it? Whether it's fear or anxiety, whatever it may be.

My car payments are high sell your car and take the bus. This is Crews were talking about we're talking about dreams. What did you give up on your dream? Why did you say? Why? Why did you let that dream go the dream that meant so much to you. Why did you let it go? Was it because you listen to those around you those who didn't reach their own dream.	1.0
Did you listen to them when they oppose their limits on you?	1.0
They said be realistic. They said take that job. Was it because you had no example coaching you of anyone who actually went after their dream and refuse to settle for less. Why did you give up when you're young?	1.0
You know without question. There are no limits. There's nothing you cannot be nothing. You cannot accomplish no height. You cannot scale, you know that but as time wears on for most people like tips away. Little more at the soul just way at their business just wait at their belief in themselves opinions get inside and poison this phone this world is filled with smart people who didn't make it smart people. They lost. Hope smart people. They gave up smart people who lack the courage to listen to the voice inside that says, yes, I can't Dad, listen to society who said most people don't most people fail.

Why did you give up on your dream? But how did you make your dream become a reality?	1.0
You've got to figure out what it is that actually makes you feel alive. And if you understand that the game that you're playing is actually a game of brain chemistry and that nothing else matters. There's no objective truth. There's no one path to Glory. There's no one life for you to live. There's only the subjective truth that thing inside you that gut instinct that voice that Whispers to you. You've got to learn to trust that you've got to learn to trust it by building it up. You've got to The Trusted by taking actions and gut checking yourself and asking is that me is that who I want to be or is that somebody else cultural voice my parents my lover whatever trying to speak through me and his Harley Davidson said when writing a story of your life, don't let anyone else hold the pen. So right now ask yourself. He's writing your story. Is it you are you really listening to the voice in your head? Are you looking at and listening? Living by the things that give you the chills or are you trying to live a life that somebody else wants for you? And remember when you think about that question what William James said act as if what you do matters because it does even if for nobody else every step you take every thought that you were allowed to permeate your mind everything you obsess about your dreams the things that you want the hopes that you spend your time. I'm with they matter to you because they tell you who you are.	1.0
They tell you who you're trying to become and ultimately those things that you let monopolize your mind will become you. So if somebody else is holding the pen if somebody else is forcing you to write something that doesn't make you feel alive. That is a life lost.	0.0
And that is how you die my friends before you ever had a chance to live. I need you to develop that what now mentality. You know exactly what I'm talking about when you lose that job.	0.0
when everything disappeared what now? Let me tell you.	1.0
What now is dedication Relentless effort to achieve your dreams putting the plan together? Not just jumping into the water with no life vest put the Strategic plan together. So we greater than you were yesterday for me greater than anything anybody could ever imagine. We just think about dreams. We believe that it's up to other people to believe.

Every lesson that you learned in the process of life, it's time you into something you're not. Life is pain and it removes some of the greatest things we ever had. For one of the hardest things to do is to keep on this to keep chasing. You song the beautiful beautiful Taste of great you blame your trials and tribulations with trial some points because your phone your dog your brother your sister your mother your grandfather your grandmother then defended the first you must ask yourself. Are you wanting the blade Almond Breeze the dream? They won't understand this one. I'm waking up every day doing some more over here.

I think I'm going to ask.	1.0
This is the question. You must ask yourself.	1.0
We all back. What up?	1.0
Hold back.	1.0
I got to be honest with you. You don't want to look back on your life old and gray and say I could add or I should have taken that one opportunity. That one action that one chance that could have given me a completely different life to move that engine order to build even just the slightest bit of momentum 1 inch is all it takes it's the time in your life where it's do or die. What are you going to do lock into what you want and lock out everything that wants to keep you from getting there but makes you feel happy and fulfilled what lights you up from inside. How do you want to feel as Person, it's the time when you're feeling like you're scraping the bottom of the barrel you're in the dark, but it's up to you to change your perception to shed some light on where you are. It's the time when you're ready to give up. But you know, if you do you'll never be able to live with yourself with the guilt and shame of not pulling yourself out of this state become your biggest support system. You can't keep allowing the lack of support from others to discourage you to the point where you don't take action and you end up giving up. Up on your dreams overnight success of the fantasy but real success is within your reach no matter who you are no matter where you are at in your life right now for you to pull your way back out of where you put yourself in understand it. Was you to put you there. No one else you you are here because of you and you're the only person that can get back out of it. So most people stop but successful entrepreneurs evide Learners and groups and individuals know, The Becoming better as a continuous consistent process not a game where the night sometimes we get too hung up on who doesn't support our Dream, right? My wife doesn't support my dream. My husband doesn't support my dream. My parents don't believe in my dream. Well, let me ask you a very important question. Do you support your dream your gifts your Billings your value? It's about you. You created the pot. You already lined the white and inclusive. It is now easier to identify the things that need to be learned from now you own it. You've heard of the instant success stories the Legends the Trailblazers the Rocks aren't they are the ones we Envy the other ones we want to be the stories. I've heard about people who achieve overnight success. They're just stories. It's a lot sexier to say someone just showed up and success rained down on them, but it's not the truth. There's always a hidden backstory of hard work of A lot of pain no one gets to the top without identifying what success feels like for them without sticking to it for 10 years or more without mastery. If you can't think if you can't bring yourself to move out of your current mental state to one of growth purpose and progress. I want you to follow me. Take a deep inhale. Ask yourself. What you need in your life right now close your eyes and exhale into the vision you have for your life. It's going to allow you to climb back out of the hole that you put yourself in shed light on your current position and be grateful for the experiences that are now about to take place. I'll ask you now. What is above you what's in front of you. You can't go any lower you spiral down as far as you can go. The only Direction now is up. All you have to do is just move that one inch many people won't understand why you're grinding they won't understand why you're attending masterminds and private workshops instead of partying all night long at the club. They're not going to understand that, you know that short-term sacrifices lead to long-term prosperity. Sometimes you need to let go of what you want now to get what you want later, but it's worth it because you're playing the long game success takes time success takes effort. But I promise you that when you finally get there, you'll look back at all of it, and you won't regret a single moment. They will understand that you're building a lifestyle that most people only dream about adding value that will pack the thousands of people and that what you do will leave a legacy long after you're gone from this Earth. They're not going to understand any of that and you know what you shouldn't care if they understand this or not. He's the thing to people can get to the one destination they can get to the same destination. But who's stronger at the end the one who had it easier or the one who started further back who started in a deeper hole who had to overcome more adversity those two people are going to get to the same spot the same destination. One of them is going to be stronger. Your only objective is to lock in on what you truly want for your Life so from now on get rid of the things that are just a distraction if it doesn't fall in alignment with your goals your values the direction you want to go and the place you want to be it is not for you. You need to Define your teeth aim not someone elses. The only way to achieve success without giving up on your happiness is to understand and Define. What is it? Like for you? You got to understand that when you have a vision or a great purpose to add value to the world. This is your journey alone to travel you need to clean yourself to look further than a few months a year. What do you want to do? Do and have at that time. Who do you want to be? How do you want to serve and contribute when you have that vision gets real with yourself and ask what needs to happen now to make that Future Vision my reality. So I take a deep inhale stand up straight lift your chin off your chest pull your shoulders back and start to look in the direction of where you want to go move that each when you get to that. State creating results in your area of expertise is almost effortless. It's an organic process that comes easily to you. Remember the further you spiral down just means the more growth there is on the way back up in the stronger you'll be and you're still waiting around for some kind of signal to finally go hard and give your dreams everything. You got stop seeing it as work ahead of you, but there's only growth ahead of you. There's only That can be had that's it. You can only go up from here and the growth is needed to be where you want to beat. I want you to tell yourself right now that you don't need permission to pursue your dreams. Not my permission not your family's permission not loved ones. Not any expert who rules or anybody else. Never needed anyone else has permission to tap into your greatness. The only kind of success that matters is the kind that lasts if you achieve success only to have it slip through your fingers. All you have then is Disappointment understand that you can't change what you've done wrong, but you can change your perception of it and that's what's going to help you move that inch.	1.0
So in order to succeed take your life to that next level, you've got to get to the point of your dreams become more important than anyone and everything.	1.0

And of course anchor which houses everything that you hear here and we appreciate all of the support and we hope that you all continue supporting us in the Future Let's go ahead and get into the notable new releases. Now we were talking about last episode that we were kind of disappointed because it hasn't really been any music coming out but last week we did get a healthy dose of music. So let's go ahead and go over the new releases 2 Chainz brought out his new project called rapper go to the league, which you had LeBron being a are for which I found that very strange, you know, it's a lot of controversy behind that because they were saying that he did not go to some games or he I'll just just to work on the album, but that's neither here nor there. It was very interesting to change took him onto to be in a are so and he said like this wasn't only project he had them like work on another project to so we'll see what comes through with that but it was a decent album. I listened to it on Friday when it dropped T-Pain Shawty pain because I don't know you probably don't watch it. But I know my girl religiously watch The Masked Singer where they had a whole bunch of whole bunch of Artists and athletes and everything you can name of entertainers dress up in Crazy suits and singing and then, you know, they get voted off of what night and T-Pain want it all and she got me into watching it and I was like, yeah, I was like I can tell his accent. I know that that's t-paint right there and the judge just weren't getting it but he ended up winning everything and if the funny thing ironically though, I would say coincidentally, I won't say ironically coincidentally his New project called wind up drop like the same week that he would so now everybody everybody is thinking that it was just a roll out. This is just to get people to listen to his music. But what did he case his new project called one up that came out like in the middle of the week didn't come out Friday, but go and listen to that Solange. She has been bringing like a lot of visuals and everything and people were like what's going on like she was even like posting a Pedro BlackPlanet people like this Black Planet back. So like right? Yeah, so it was kind of weird it everybody would kind of like speculating what was going on but turns out she has a new project. So she was just doing a lot of promotion for that. So her new project is called when I get home you can go and listen to that little Skies dropped Shelby. I think that this is his second official Studio project from not mistaken. I don't know if we have any little Skies fans that the listen to us, but I believe this is the second official Studio project. So going to listen that if you're a little Skies fan and finally the baby I just get so confused because there's there there's now a saturation of babies out there. We got a little baby then we got double baby. So it's very confusing at times. I like who the hell is is but he's a North Carolina native their child in North Carolina and he dropped his new project called Baby on baby. So very interesting title for a project but those are the notable new releases for the week of March 1st currently its March forth as we're recording. Adding this but these are all the release that came out the week of March 1st. So let's get into the music news. First knew that we have here is Tyrese. Mr. Tyrese is slated to play Teddy Pendergrass and the biopic Now by all pigs have become like very very popular. I think that more and more people were seeing like that. People are very very interested to see some of these stories from the people. You may not know much about you like the inside scoop go through everything that Of that they have been to in their lives and I don't care how many people clown Tyrese I think that he's a good singer. I think that he's a good actor as well. I know he did get called The Fast and Furious stuff, but I mean that's where he made all the bread as I ain't mad and forgetting all their bread and stink it up stick it with the series as long as he did, but Tyrese obviously has been in other movies as well. Like baby voice is probably where everybody remembers him from but he said that Teddy Pendergrass actually asked him to tell his story before you passed away. Not a one thing that I've always. Always had a problem with that. I had an issue with it when it comes to biopics it when you don't actually ask anybody who was around the person or you don't ask the person himself. If you're just going to like make us up as she go that's not a good biopic in my case. But in this particular case with Teddy Pendergrass, he actually is going to have Joan Pendergrass which is Teddy Pendergrass his widow Teddy Pendergrass. By the way. He passed away in 2010. And he's going to have little Marvin is going to come on and write the screenplay and this is all supposed to be Do this by Lee Daniels which pretty much as his hands and everything, so I'm not surprised that Lee Daniels it's going to do this but this biopic but I thought this was interesting though. We have no date as to when it's going to come out. But this is this is all the news that we have so far. So, how do you feel about Tyrese playing Teddy Pendergrass antibiotic?	0.0
Hmm should be interesting is to say the least I would have never thought, you know playing Teddy Pendergrass would be like Tyrese. Yeah, right. It's kind of weird. He's gotta do like, you know, they got to put them in full transformation. I suppose. We'll see how it worked. Oh, absolutely. I think that's an interesting story and then like you touching on like people are really interested in any biopics. I think you know for every for every like good when we do have some bad ones, but I mean, I think when I think of like the good ones, I think like the Bobbi Brown one that was pretty good. The new edition was probably the best one. It was a few more and they are you you have then you have the ones like Alia and the other stuff like that. So it's like it was a couple of the bad ones. I don't want to harp on them. But it's I like I like watching those because you get to see you even when you think you know everything about the artist or something like that that that's public knowledge those little those little tidbits to come in and he's like damn I ain't realized that like, will you watch the Bobby Brown stuff? You didn't know he was hitting Janet Jackson like no. I mean how many people really knew that? I didn't so it was like, okay.	1.0
Yeah, well love while stuff. So again, we'll see I will keep you all updated when we get some some proper dates and will also let you know since Lee Daniels is on it. I'm pretty sure this is going to go to the Silver Screen. But again, a lot of these ball picks up going to like lifetime it BTW and stuff. So I'll hope that they you know end up giving it more Justice and put it on the movie theater. So, you know, we'll see how this one goes second bit. Is Wu-Tang they're going back on tour. This is going to be a majority worldwide tour. Obviously, they're going to be in the States but the majority of the legs of the tour or going to be overseas. They are going on tour with Public Enemy and they lost soul and this is going to be called the gods of wrapped or and it starts actually on the first weld it with this is when it did let's give me this one when to take it when I say, oh, I'm sorry, but the actual leg the first leg starts in London on May the 10th, but when they come back to the States, they're going to be in flocks area and going to be in Chicago on June 1st, and then they're going to be in Cleveland Simpsonville, South Carolina, Raleigh, North Carolina, Asheville Boston on Cassville. I think that's in Connecticut and Landing City Seattle Mountain View, California, Wichita, Kansas Council Bluffs, Iowa, I think and me and hapless, Minnesota on August 2nd. What to end the tour now I know that we did talk about will take last album, which we didn't think was very good. But I'm more than certain expenses just going on tour Public Enemy. They'll also they're going to be doing a lot of old stuff like that's that's just what it is, especially for the we talked about this before as well how a lot of a lot of people overseas like that's where they get their money and if you can still go overseas and still perform all your old hits, then you're still popping and people overseas love love artist over here and they love all of Their old stuff that they that they came out with over a year. So how you feel about this tour with this be something that you will be slightly interested in since they're coming to school.	1.0
Yep. I sure would I gotta see what day that's on on the first time. If I can't I made check that out the daylight. So I was crazy last episode we did. I was just talking about them, you know saying how I wished a lot of this stuff was still on with no was on Spotify, but I know about the whole deal though, Tommy Boy stuff and you know, he got this whole boycott with Tommy Boy wish who they were signed with. You know, Tommy blade basically saying de la Sol's I'm a bunch of money. So maybe them going on tour right now is, you know direct result of them trying to get get get out of debt with Tommy Boy.	1.0
Hmm.	1.0
Okay, and they praised they went on record by praising Jay-Z by not know streaming the music on title because of they like no we're not getting anything from it. So so they praised Jay-Z for that too and sucks a snowman. Yeah. It really does artists that can go overseas like you said. Yeah, man, that's that's huge when people like I don't think people know how rewarding it is that when someone that don't even speak the language no every word of your song and appreciate your music. That's crazy. Like a lot of people think that's weird here. Like somebody come over here ramp rapping in French or something like that or Germany, like what the hell is that? Like it's very rare that one of those type of songs pop here in the US. It's been a couple that would like most of the songs is like not even in language, but it's extremely rare for when they hold. Olga celebrated like that. That's that's tremendous. It just goes to show that the rest of the world is like, you know a lot more appreciative of good music than we are here.	1.0
And that's kind of sad. Now. Did you say them out loud? It's the truth though. It is it is, you know for sure about that in June 1st is going to be on the Saturday.	0.0
Maybe off that Saturday too. That's the Saturday before that's like a week before he three. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah might have to look into that man through true.	1.0
I've got talked about this last but I think it's actually it's a good segue since you mentioned the day or so and Tommy Boy situation. Now this new just came today, but the original story from a few weeks ago our boy Kanye West has been in a legal battle with Rockefeller and Emi who has been signed with since 2003 Kanye West with the Timothy to gain his ownership of his music and receive unpaid royalties, but now the news has come around that's mr. Kanye West has sold his soul and you know, I mentioned that he was with the Amana 2003 but his contract got extended in 2010, but according to this contract and I'm going to read what it says here and I can read the whole thing, but But verbatim it says at no time during the term. Will you seek to retire as a songwriter recording artist or producer or take any extended Hiatus during which you are not actively pursuing your musical career and the same basic manner issue in for sued such career to date. So what that means is that if Kanye loses his battle this man still can't retire like that's that's just wild this is wild. After all it is your trying to get ownership of your music Emi Rockefeller on it. You're trying to get unpaid royalties and they like well, okay no matter what happens. You can't retire bread according to this contract. So it's just another one of those situations where you're not reading fully what's going on or you are reading and you're just willingly signing over everything that you own and everything that you work for. These companies are shady man. And it just it sucks. I know that we made for The Kanye Kanye gun some wild stuff especially last year alone, but I don't want to hear this from anybody. I don't want to hear anybody trying to fight to get ownership of their music and then end up being a Slave at the end of the day because of some loophole or something that the artist did not look at before they actually signed a contract or signed the extension. So, how do you feel about this whole situation with Kanye?	0.0
That's that's rough math. Like they say there's all the time and the music industry. Designed to keep you in debt and this is just another example of it man. It's a lot of these little backwards deals that they that they toss in there to keep you to keep you working to keep they pockets lace while you get next to nothing out of it. It's just it's sad bro. Like I don't ever want to see nobody go through that. Especially someone that works like, you know, the way we know all know Kanye works okay ago in the hibernation and work for like 6 to 7 months straight. No and very seldom calling out for For some time. So I just think that's it's just toughness like never Rockefeller of all, you know of all places like kind of crazy. It just makes you think different about a lot of people that we'd be celebrating even the labels that we'd like yo, they was getting it. It's like yeah, but at what cost a lot of people like basically selling a soul just to get on and years later 15 years later. They still can't they can't even break free of that shit. Like I was just explained with the de la Sol's Shit that they came out with 30 years ago today, you know saying they can't even say not even getting money off of that which is crazy. Like how do you still have a choke?	0.0
Hold on something dirty years ago man, that's just oh my God it just thinking about that. It's super wild 30 years ago and you still can't get money off the music that you created. How does that work, man?	0.0
Sure, rough bro. It's the music. That's the that's the way it goes man. That's why it's like it's like now it's so much easier because most people can just go independent. But you know, then it was like, you know, you'll dream was to be on a major and get your music played on the radio and stuff like that like a lot of artists that going through that now like the product of the you know, I won't say pre internet but before the internet took control of the music, No, so that's just as is what it is man, they'd assign a lot of bullshit deals and paying for it right now to this day.	0.0
Yeah good back then. I mean that was the only way that you were really going to pop and you know as a young kid, especially given your situation, you know, you wanted to just signed a deal you wanted to get that money. So you just did it unknowingly, you know, these kids don't know anything about business. So there's how it is like the labels were literally just taking advantage of all these kids that just wanted to put out some music and I wanted to be famous and get some money.	0.0
Yeah, hoping it'll get greater later and stuff like that. You be like I am and like that's renegotiate this man. I need this isn't this taking off this taking off. I made y'all enough money with you know, if I decide to go elsewhere and 2010 then you know saying it's all good. We just we just cut, you know, cut off what we what we are now. I don't know you you don't know me and stuff like that, but it'll never work out that way. Yeah record label typically always wins that battle now	0.0
Big yikes crooked.	0.0
It's a crooked shady-ass game.	0.0
Yeah. So like I said, I respect everybody who decides to go independent and you know, I know if you do sign a deal that's on you, but I just hope that you have somebody in your corner. If you yourself know that you're not going to be that business savvy and you're not gonna you know, thoroughly read every bit of whatever contracted they're trying to get you to sign. I know everybody want distribution deals and stuff, but honestly you can do you know majority that stuff yourself now as far as like that Tied me.	1.0
So we got to have them attorneys dead man present why they sign an issue Brooke because it's probably still going on. It's just not as know up front as it was in but you know, that was always something I always heard people say like don't sign shit unless you know type of business deal that you have an attorney to and not someone that like watching that Toc that was another one the TLC, uh, biopic fact, I was another one reading does she right? She like yo, we want our own, you know, say we want our own Manager and stuff like that. Why would you know, why would we want to you know use somebody from your management company to manage us because they only know how your company and you know, you know best and best interest in mind, you know and not have our best interests in mind and that's how a lot of people get jerk. Could they just so eager to say yo we on we on don't say I play my song on the radio and then when you look up the biggest selling group, you know saying in pretty much R&B female R&B history ended up 50,000 today name, you know say after that record sold millions of copies. So it's just kind of crazy super trashy.	0.0
Another example is rather Compton Ice Cube was smart. He looked at the country like yo like this thing right where my money at Jerry Heller he's giving them all the all the hoopla ride the runaround Trinkets and shit. Yeah, you like yo, I'm out and then, you know, we're trying to get everybody to look at that contract easy one having a dr. Dre everyone having a nobody else was having any like yo you trippin Ice Cube said, all right. I'm out. Out about to go somewhere else and then dr. Dre finally realized after the fact he like yo, like I'm not trying to deal with this no more which you should look like. I know you tried give me all the jury Ellis situation, but you ain't no better. So I'm about to start my own company. So it'd be like they love eventually you realize it. Hopefully, you know, you do get that chance to realize before it's too late and a lot of these artists unfortunately did not get the chance and they did not realize it until again. It was too late and I didn't dealing with this situation and it's very sad man. Very very sad, but Again, we'll keep you up to date on this kind of situation is not looking good for him though. Just because they knew that we got today as a big yikes on this situation real big guys. They literally making this man to slave like how its worded that man's a slave right now. So although being really get out of there because I know this man is being stressed forever and this is just another another hurdle that hopefully he can get through if kind can get his master's dog. It's gonna be over he's gonna definitely be happy man. But if he had my Rockefellers, don't keep a lot Lock on his master's. Yes. It's going to be terrible and then you can't retire either. Yeah, that sucks.	0.0
That's contract basically says we own you. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah working. Yeah, you can't do anything on your own terms. You gotta keep working keep turning down music. She's crazy. She's crazy. But let's get off of that. Let's get on some positive news J. Cole says that he wants revenge of the dreamers 3 to come out in April. They're still working on it again that whole like 10-day process which is Louis to get all of the vocals done. I presume the vocals in the production, but obviously takes a long time to make sure to get all the samples clear that they have mix and master everything. So again, it's a process. I know that you know as Fans of dreamville. I wanted you know the stuff to come out a little bit earlier when they first announced it but under their realistically I wasn't going to happen. I was trying to say like the end of February but obviously going to take a longer time in that but he was just talking to some fans the other day and he did not like directly confirm that it's going to come out in April what this is just what he is hoping that the album will come off revenge of the dreamers. Meanwhile, we've been trying to make sure they and the dreamers 3 is done and then put it on video. So the middle child videos now and of course he was at all-star weekend. He performed and participated in the in the dunk contest as well helping out not some people so it's cool man, but I'll open it. It does come out in April like he like he wanted to hopefully we don't as music fans have to wait too much longer because I already know this is gonna be some heat from the previews that we've been hearing and I know Jay ID, for example that man has been on tour going to places and The like previewing some stuff as well. So what are you expecting from this from this compilation album when it comes out flood fire.	1.0
Nothing, but fire. That's what I'm expecting. I'll speak nothing less than that. I love compilation album show. So I'm a sucker for a good one. So when that comes out, I'm I'm listening to as soon as Thomas pack some heat and I'm sure I won't be disappointed.	1.0
Big fox big facts, so there you go people still no no concrete release date yet. But again, we will keep you all updated on adventures during this 3 because that is definitely my most anticipated project of this year so far. Let's get into the album reviews. We have one album that we are going to review today and that is going to be offset father of four now all set as head of hair. The 2018 the man has been getting it be for people. He got married secretly. He had a child with cardi B and he's been in his share of scandals. Not only did he get into some beef with with Chris Brown. Soulja Boy is going to come at them a little bit. And of course the whole cheating scandal which had pretty much everybody who was a cardi B fan on his head and saying that he was piece of shit and all that stuff. He was supposed to actually release his album last year. Here but ended up getting pushed back and I'm sure that it got pushed back because of all the scandals that he just had to try to salvage his relationship him and cardi end up getting separated for a little bit. But now they're back together taking care of the child and looks like they're being a family and they for the most part gotten through all of that stuff because that's what people when you love somebody. That's what you do. You got to fight to keep your girl and when he ended up bringing out the project, you know, The Breakfast Club and actually respected what he said on the interview, it seems like he's He's evolved and reflected a lot. I know that everybody is Presley these blind fans and want to just automatically condemn somebody if they do one bad thing or they do a couple bad things. But at the end of the day that's his wife, and that's that's his baby mamas life or his wife's like that ain't your life. So who are you to judge when you're on the outside looking in like that's not your thing that you have to go through and it seemed like all say realize that it specially in their Breakfast Club interview and on this album it. Definitely reflected a lot of like what he was going through. He definitely had multiple songs about his children about cardi situation. He apologized and million times on it and it seemed like he actually wants to be a better husband and a better a better father to his the newborn and his other three kids that he had with his other baby mamas now, obviously as far as talent wise talent and celebrity wise, I don't think we know any of them compared to cardi B and even if they did I'm pretty sure cars if he's gonna The biggest baby mama at all I know but but they're still you know, not to not to discredit any other any other baby mamas we had children with but obviously he you know loves all of them just the same and I just think that he's overall just grew as a person which people can do so for this particular album has 16 songs total features Big rule. Shout out to be a group. That's definitely a huge huge thing and Atlanta Jayco Jay Cole been doing a lot of features. I'm actually very Why did he just keep jumping on features? So that's that's pretty well gonna yeah, see low on here Travis guy 21 Savage cardi B. Quavo and Gucci Mane and I will say my favorite songs from this album would be quarter. Millie clout wild wild west and how did I get here? Now as far as this album compared to the other solo albums by takeoff and quavo. I gotta say that I think offsets out. Was the best I would have we said that that was going to happen. Yeah, but I think that we were a little bit worried just because when take off sound came out that was it was very underwhelming. So a lot of people like man, why don't all says I was gonna be but I think that again he had the best album after listening to it. I think he has some really good features. I think that in and this might be a hot take here is might be unpopular opinion. I think the offset out of the Migos is probably the most versatile. Especially after hearing this album. I thought that quavo initially was quavo the hood guy and you know, he he's a good songwriter or whatever. He definitely definitely rent some songs first Ojai name artist, but I think that quavo just kind of got to take a step back because quavo really isn't the lyrical dude. I think they offset is like takeoff and quavo mixing the one I think that he has a bigger a bigger bigger repertoire that Really propels him above his other counterparts and I think they really showed on this album, especially with the features. I didn't find one feature to be like out of place or sound weird North Star was CeeLo Green CeeLo. Green killed that obviously had big Ruban the very first song Father for J. Cole killed and on. How did I get here? Cardi B actually think our DB I'll wrap them which is funny on clout. I think the party be gonna kill - I would like, whoa, I'll say whoa. This is gotta is kind of	1.0
Oh, wow, like you said it before I did.	1.0
Yeah, I think she actually killed the brunette and then accordingly we Gucci Mane. I think that's my there's definitely my favorite out of all of the songs on here. I just think that be was dull but I like all the production my homies are trying to argue with me and he was like man, he's like just sound like some simple shit he over here talking about his kids and talking about, you know, I'm sorry cardi B every song by Mike. What else are you supposed to do? Like, this is what he's been going through for a whole year. Bam, like I would rather him talk about what's going on his life then fake it and act like nothing happened because we clearly know this something happened. So this is what you do when you grow and you make songs and you make projects about your life. Like you have to grow you have to evolve like obviously he still talking about like the same old shit, like like getting money and mess with women is stuff which I still find it funny because they're like was like, we know what's going on with your life. But you know, you still gotta for the people that I get. Guess halfway don't listen or don't care. You still gotta keep up that Persona in a sense, but was still even with that like he still had some like some like really really touching and personal songs. Like don't lose me. That was a that was a very personal song Father for the very first songs on here and then came a long way that was probably like his one of the most personal songs those three right there. But but overall like I like the production I thought that you know for the majority it was upbeat. I was messing with it compared to the other two Migos projects and I think their overall like like in this is just comparing all the D'Amico's like he had the best like it was it was just no question. He definitely had the best albumin and I enjoyed it. I put a lot of songs on here and I've been listening to it ever since it came out. So so that's my take on it. How you feel about this like	1.0
It was it was decent decent out of the songs that I that you know, I mean out of the whole album the songs that I liked was the most was made men wild wild west and clout. Those are the songs. I like the most you already stated that cardi B. You got them on that song. She killed that shit came front. I just hope she wrote it. That's all I can say about that. Hopefully she wrote it here.	1.0
Ready for man or nobody else for that matter and you know, that's what they were saying.	1.0
I'm just saying let's not act like there's no act like it ain't you ain't true that you know allegations ain't always been out there Sion right on stuff. Yeah. I thought that that very first song that actually opening track which was I believe it was father for got really personal talk about, you know, his oldest son and all the stuff saying how you know, he was 17 when you had them and she like that I felt that shit that shit was that shit was kind of tough. Okay, and then you touched on like him, you know getting in the beef and shit like that with other rappers and stuff like that. I just seen like Snippets of the stuff with him on that Ebro and he still talking popping off his like second. I wanted to get behind them after I watch that Breakfast Club interview that he did it was like, okay, maybe he's in misunderstood. He turn right back around saying how like the you know, the older the older generation should basically should you know should thank them and shit like that. I'm like, okay. Yeah. Like come off am like we were I was rooting know the hold the Vivica Fox me my was rooting for you. That's that's how I was now. It's kind of like, I don't know FAMU just you switching up on me too much. So yeah with that being said those would have the songs that I like the most on it without no talking too much on it at that made man was hot. It was probably that was probably my favorite song at all. A made man was hot like the said the Wild Wild West Joy I'm with her. I wasn't gonna that shit was tight to and I said the cardi B Carter be stole that, you know saying she had the best verse on on the whole album to me do anything for clout? Yeah. She had the best verse on the album on the entire album with all those features Gucci. It was a lot of features to like, I think it was like 16 songs and like eight of the songs have features on them. So that's a bit much for my for my taste. I mean, you got 16 songs. I don't want to see more than like for features. Just my personal my personal preference, but that for that I'll give it a go give it a two and a half out of five. I'm gonna give it a two and a half. It was the best out of every solo project from them.	1.0
Okay? Okay, and I presented a question. I was like damn he got all these features are like it's offset low-key cheating compared to compared to the other Migos because they didn't have that many features or at least take off dating because quavo kind of he did have a share. Teachers as well, but I felt like Allstate had the best set of features. So I was like, yeah was he is he kind of cheating on this? Like I still thought that he had the best the best album out of the three, but the features like if you're looking at it from that perspective that the county is cheating like because it's like damn can you do any dope song by yourself, but I still gave him the benefit of the doubt because I still enjoy like the majority of the songs on here.	0.0
So the one of the songs I picked on it, which was I think it was made man didn't have a feature and that was so low.	0.0
That was so so again my take on it from all the features that I end up liking the majority of the songs. He clearly had the best out of the Three Amigos. I'm gonna give him a 3. I'ma get my three just just based off of off of that along because I really thought especially after the delay the first delay. I was like man, I don't know about this. Like, what is he really trying to do was he trying to save face what else is really going on with it? But I think all in all once it finally came out. I thought they did was a pretty a pretty decent album and I enjoyed it for the most part for what it is the production to I forgot to mention. Yeah production will definitely good for ducks with Delphine. Good night. And obviously that would me that's you know, my biggest thing. I look at the reduction first and then like at the features on there. I'm seeing how you mesh well with the features and then you know, the lyrics come out through for me. So again, I enjoy it down man. I definitely do it. So I'm gonna give it a three. So that's our takes on it. Also Father for I I give it a 3 flight gives a two and a half. So there you go man as I'm review. Let's get to the song of the week. Now. I have to make two chains again because I don't know if you got a chance to listen to a rapper go to the league yet, but there was a particular song and let me not mess this up here give you the proper name of the song, but it had Ariana Grande on it. And it's only called rude earlier. Yeah, it's called rule the world and it had a Camry Camry sample here. I was like, whoa. I said I know this sucks. I said, what is this? I said oh, oh no, I feel like I told everybody on Twitter. I said are we gonna grind a doing uh doing a remix of why don't we fall in love and what I'm going home? He's like nah, he's I always felt that I was like, yo I said give it a chance man. Give it a chance. I'll legs actually a good song where you like. Nah, you like I'm good. But it just inspired me to like go back and listen to the Emery. So I want to we fall in love and when she came out. Oh man, I forgot like how hot she was fam. Like this song was fucking dope and shit. So I would have listened. I was like yo, this song was bumping yo, they beat was was dope as hell. So this is going to be my song for the week and that was inspiration from the from the sample remix for a router word vagina Grande en change to chase album. So Amory, why don't we fall in love? This came out in 2002 people 2002 to memory did take a long break, but she did apparently come back. I haven't even get channels in that album. Do I ain't even gonna lie, but but you did come back and start making music again, but when we first came out man, she had a bus. She definitely had a bus. So I respected that and this was definitely one of my favorite songs from her. Why don't we fall in love the find Marie Van de saint-fond is that stain? Wait find is that they I death he had a crush on her face that want that one thing video, bro.	1.0
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I'll yeah, it was it was wild man.	1.0
We have to find a swimming when we were growing up fam.	1.0
No, she came out she came out during a during a transition at a guard so to speak to an R&B. So I don't know if she just got lost in the shuffle or I know she has some like some shit with a management and stuff like that. So it was just crazy, but she always made good music.	1.0
Yeah, absolutely. It's just she just she just was never	1.0
She was better than the the bottom tier R&B artist, but she was just never looked at it that the top like the Beyonce's and stuff like that and she came out right around the time like after Leah past stuff like that. So it's like it was it was easy to get lost in that and I shuffle I suppose.	1.0
Yeah, and that will definitely during the time when the with 106 & Park Until rail was going on. So, I mean, that's why a lot of people knew about her including myself, but it was just so many artists that came out then so it definitely was easy like you Like you said to just just get missed throughout their Bunch, but the real recognize her that's what I'll say the real the real recognize we never forgot about you Emory. So I thought right so shot to you. Why don't we fall in love came out in 2002 and what you got for this week's vlog?	1.0

But you know, it was it was it was it was a good movie though. You like those types of movies man, you check that shit out and that's basically storytelling in that in that song and that sample was hot too.	1.0

Let's get to the topic of the week here. And well, we review toys on this for the last episode but favorite producers of all time favorite producers of all time. If you want to break it up we can do like in the past and then present if you want to do it like that, but I want to definitely let you take the floor on this one go ahead and when they came off some of your favorite producers anybody who inspired you anything like that now I ain't gonna wiggle wiggle wiggle	1.0
Everybody up just our I'm just going to I'm just going to shoot down a line real brief with it. Just all top because it's so many to name her like I can see like the I can talk on and off ever so high but I won't I was just like just be real brief just the ones I think of off top and then I'll just name a few that I feel like never get the credit. They deserve that I think is really good as well. But I'll start off you got to start off with the Fuji Quincy Jones like Quincy Jones. We talked about Quincy Jones When you talk about his Netflix, Joining, right mmm, but I like how you didn't even know that he produced no saying a lot of different stuff. Like when I was talk about the Austin Powers and it's my party and all that type of stuff. Like a lot of people didn't know about that. You know, a lot of people don't know about the Michael Jackson stuff. The Quincy Jones had his fingers in a lot of shit got though Quincy Jones our IP J. Dilla course, no saying probably my favorite of all time. Probably just the way he the way he laid laid his chops and stuff down was like some shit. Brilliance for like people still can't figure out how you did some of the city due to this day with that. Mpc2000 DJ Premier and other one 9th. Wonder who's my personal favorite right now Riza. Well, I think never gets the credit. He deserves, you know with the Wu-Tang dr. Dre, of course Timberland, if you're not if you're not aware of some of the shit that tamerlan did man like everything from Missy to live to Justin Timberlake North and Nelly Furtado like you name Timberland for someone who's the dude for real? And then I throw in Kanye now, I'll just I'll stop right there. It was a because it's just a lot of different people like I could like opt like people that don't people don't check for as much I believe that Big crib is a dope producer that people don't talk about nothing crisis who's with the soul council with 9th Wonder and I'm he don't get talked about he got some hot shit. It a lot of different people man. Not that's another one that I checked for. What about Hindus to do them? Gz beats and trap beats shorty red Shawty red on the trail. He used to do some hot shit man. Like Todo Jones was hot man. That's a lot of people Mannie Fresh. He was another one I can think of this is a lot of people mantid. You could just go on for hours talking about producer.	1.0
Okay? Okay. I'm going to piggyback off you. I'm not going to name the same people twice, but as everybody knows who listen to this podcast and just you know mess with Over the years for rails my absolute favorite producer of all time, but I want to add some more people jazze PHA. I think I didn't jazze PHA definitely made definitely made a lot of Jazzy Fizzles production zaytoven, even though even though I kind of criticized him a lot of times because for the longest he did not make like different sound he beats he loved using those freaking Jamaican drums and it he will not do anything else, but they Toven, he literally like me Gucci Mane's career. I'm not even gonna lie, like he may go to man's career because those be they made for him like and all those freaking mixtapes albums that he put out. They told him made that sound fam. So like they told me I had to get his respect for the new wage trap sound in ATL like without a doubt that man is freaking amazing. Who else who was want to mention Bangladesh back when he was popping Bangladesh Bangladesh definitely has some dope-ass his just blaze just Blues.	1.0
Just blue. Absolutely. He was another had that distinct sound and it came in. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know about that. Oh, yeah ain't going back to Burrell like therefore bar set up like that. That's that's the Pharrell sound read. The four bar setup is for Real sound who else I want to mention and why can't I remember his name now and this is kind of kind of sad.	0.0
Oh, are you thinking wait think I let me shout out Pete Rock to I forgot to mention Pete Rock man. I don't want to my cousin a killed me if I didn't say.	0.0
Pete Rock true true Metro Boomin shout out the st. Louis Metro Boomin. Definitely. He was part of the the new age sound as well like the the current sound and also want to throw in Tyler the Creator. I think he's very underrated as an as a producer but he's definitely one of my favorites today as long as he's still making music. I just met my best results and I messed with this new sound. He definitely evolved a lot. So those are just so many people that I want to mention. It's definitely a lot more but To the one that I just wanted to to mention besides but the people to flock are you mentioned so it's a lot of good producers man. I just want to say that a lot of good producers back back in the day and and up until today. I know everybody's like looking for the new sound and I guess like right now you say like Pierre Pierre born. This is one of the people who has a lot of sounds that a lot of people emulate take Keith. I feel like he he does a lot of frickin Beast that sound the same to he's finally trying to expand but he would definitely do a lot of a lot of bees that sounded the exact same and I was like what the hell is is but a lot of you trying to lay his stuff. Yeah, that's pretty much it. It's as far as well. I can think of right now, but but she also produces man because like I said everyone for y'all, I really think that a lot of these people would sound pretty wack in my opinion a lot of influences our name that man.	1.0
Yeah out of influence will definitely like it all out. Always a fan will be you know, a mob in my production and shit. So that's why a lot of those are that I name was like sample-based you just you just admire what they do now the Metro Boomin to that I heard you mention him earlier. I like his work to that. That won't forget that joint with him and Big Sean, you know, I still be bumping that shit. Oh, yeah. That's my shirt.	1.0
Hmm. All right. So finally we have the album suggestion section flock. What do you have for us this week?	1.0
I know you're all tired of me going back to the 1990s math. So I'm going to do something a little more a little more current. I'm gonna go to 2010 though. It ain't that new but it was just an album that I there's a found myself listening to when I was at work the other night. I was listening to her. I was listening to Miguel All I Want Is You debut album? A lot of people slept on it. A lot of people got up on it, you know saying depending on who you are shit was hot, and it's still it's still it's aged. Well, even though it ain't even 10 years old. Yeah, but still a good ass out and I listened to it on occasion. Nice shit. They got something for everybody on that, you know saying if you your fan out upbeat you got something for you use Phantom slow shit got some flavor like that seductive shitty got something for you.

Hi everyone, welcome back to the high percentage podcast. I had a terrifying 20 minutes there because I was having microphone problems and I was like, wow if we don't got a microphone, we don't got a podcast today, but got that worked out. Hey back after a Hiatus last week. We did not upload an episode and an old teacher of mine used to say there's a difference between excuses and reasons and I have reasons for this. Which was I did a DCC play-by-play last weekend. It was great and it was brutal at the same time. It was two days of nothing but watching matches and typing, you know, quick play-by-play summaries on to the computer and then quickly kind of uploading them and getting them refreshed on grappling insider.com on the plus side. We had the most traffic we've ever had in a single weekend. I mean, we really crush it and I think we did the only play-by-play really that I could find on the internet. Yet and I don't know why because it's something that definitely people look for and find Value in so that was fantastic. The downside is as far as I could tell we watched over a hundred Jiu-Jitsu matches and you know, I love Jiu-Jitsu as much as the next guy or girl but that was brutal man way. It was nine hours on Sunday and we didn't finish until the Super fight ended like it probably seven o'clock and I just didn't have it in me. I couldn't talk about Submission grappling anymore. So I took a break but I did post an article about a DCC over the week and that's why I like to talk about today because a TCC is a fantastic time to kind of check in on the meta of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and submission grappling because it's generally agree that it's one of the top.	1.0
You know, it's one of the highest level caliber competitions. It brings out some of the best competitors in the world the best competitors in the World in nogi, grappling and it's a good time for us to watch what they're doing and try to figure out if the meta of Brazilian jiu-jitsu is changing and I know we've done an episode before on The Meta but I'm just going to do a quick review in case you forgot what that is. So the meta is usually short for the metagame and in it means actually two things in game theory in sports the metagame refers to anything outside of the Actual game that influences the game a good example would be like the crowd the crowd is outside the game but depending on their volume level or you know, whether you're on the home team or the away team, the crowd is a part of the metagame that will influence in some intangible, you know, maybe slight ways the outcome or the performance of The Players. So that's sort of one definition in sports in gaming particularly in Competitive Gaming The Meta is something A little different an acronym and it stands for the most effective tactic available. And when people use the term meta or someone is playing on meta with that means is that the professional level players will be using the most effective tactic available because they're professionals and it's very high stakes and you know, they want to win clearly. when me and you practice rolling in the gym we may or may not be on meta which is some of us may have sort of unique games that work well for us, but they wouldn't work well for other people or players and then some of us may not be competitors or maybe we're casual competitors and we have things that work well, but they wouldn't encounter diminishing returns as you got to the highest levels of the game, or maybe they don't even work well at all, you know, there's a lot of And I've certainly been one of them before where I've fallen in love with moves that when I think about it, they were actually fairly low percentage. But those few times that I would hit it. I'd feel really good about myself, you know, something really exotic like a go-go plot or something like that. No offense. If you're a gogoplata player, I just sort of pick something that came to mind. If you ask an average person what the meta of Brazilian jiu-jitsu is right. Now almost all of them would say like locks that we are kind of in this golden age of leg locks. That have started to come to prominence probably more or less in the last 10 years. But really I'd say in the last, you know, three to five years is when it's really really started to accelerate and people are wondering and I'm certainly wondering whether this is a trend that is going to come and go we've seen Trends sort of come and go in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. There was times when the spider guard was a really hot guard or when Marcelo Garcia was tearing it up in the early 2000s. The butterfly guard was Very popular, you know, those things sort of came and went and then there's other things that they sort of they experienced a peak and then they decline but they still stay in the game The Butterfly guards a great example It's Not Dead by any means in fact the rise of leg lock and leg attack positions has given sort of a Resurgence to the butterfly guard because it's a really good entry for some of those bottom leg attack positions. many people very smart people have recently kind of wondered aloud if the leglock craze has reached its peak and if it's going to start declining now, I was watching the BJ Fanatics brown belt Invitational and Gordon Ryan was kind of talking aloud and it was either him or the other commentator that was with him when he was it was Todd and they were basically saying, you know, they were watching these brown belts and someone said, hey, there's not as much leg locks as I thought they would be and I think it was Gordon said well, you know, People are studying the leglock game very closely. They're learning the defenses and they're not as high percentage as they used to be. So there are certainly not going to be going away. But they are just going to become another technique that you have to do and a TCC is a great chance to sort of test that theory because if there's something that's even slightly higher percentage than everything else you can bet that these world class competitors are going to be employing it. So let's talk about some of the things that we might have observed during a a DCC and whether it's going to start something that maybe lower level competitors can take a cue from first thing. I want to talk about was the dominance of guard players and that something we talked about last week, which is a TCC really penalizes you for pulling guard. However, it does not do that in the first half of the match and I should mention while I'm thinking about it. This is something that I wasn't really I didn't make as clear as I should have in the last podcast which I said if you pull guard in a TC you're penalized but that's not really true. You are allowed to pull guard in the first part of a match. It's after the halfway point that you are penalized from pulling guard. And even there there is an exception, which is I believe in overtime if you're in any overtime, then penalties are in play right off the bat. So if you go into an overtime and you sit to guard then you will be penalized. However, in the face of all that it was fascinating to see that there were several competitors that made the calculation that despite being penalized. It was still actually a net gain for them to take a penalty sit in the guard and work their game some notable examples Paul meow took penalties and over time twice, I believe because he wanted to be in guard and it wasn't just him I know meow is you know, he's a very unique person in Brazilian jiu-jitsu with kind of a legendary guard game, but it wasn't just Tenth Planet Phenom Elvira, she said to guard a couple times believe she was injured in that match. So that makes some sensor that might justify why she did outside the rule set, but even beyond that clearly she was a bottom player and even when the matches her matches were in regulation. She was sitting to guard right away Lachlan geils, he would run to the center of the Matteson he would sit in guard and in the high percentage podcast and on the website, we've talked before about how a lot Lot of these competitions atcc is one of them are structured where it's very difficult to accrue points when you're on the bottom, but despite that these competitors have still figured that they would prefer to be on the bottom because they feel like they have the best chance of getting a submission that way. Another thing that makes this impressive is that in a TCC just like in ibjjf the only way you can score points from the bottom is to sweep. However, unlike ibjjf it's much harder to score points on a sweep in 80cc because there is I think there's the to shoulder rule which is in order for someone to be considered down. Both their shoulders have to be touching the mat. I don't think it's quite like that and ibjjf, I believe it's the three second rule and it's What it allows people to do in a TCC is you can have your butt on the ground, but if you can put your hands behind you and get your shoulders off the mat, then you're not really considered down and that makes a huge difference. So people were commenting in the the commentators booth that even to get a sweep is very challenging because you have to really wrestle to get a sweep. So all of that you would think in abstract would make someone really reluctant to play guard especially when you figured that statistically submissions. Are less likely in a DCC. However, some of the very successful competitors this weekend like Laughlin geils for them. It was no question. They sat to guard immediately and started working. So what does that mean with the meta guard players are alive and well, they're not going anywhere at the Sip that the high level at high percentage. We still recommend If you're sort of a newer competitor that you take an approach of getting on top and and pursuing positional dominance so that you can score points. However, if it's no point scenario Then by all means play guard. That's what some of the best people in the world who are doing. And what kind of guards are these players using? Well, there were two guards that really stood out in the weekend. And I remember at one point me and Roy we were on a call together because in real-time to two guys who are trying to watch three mats worth of action, and I said to him men seem like to you like you you're seeing a lot of me Shield half guard and he said absolutely so the one guard that we noticed especially in day one of the tournament was a lot of people were using these Old half guard and and this includes some of its variation. So to get really technical there's the knee shield and then there's the Z guard which is generally like a lower kind of me shield. And then one thing that I noticed with Lachlan and with Craig Jones is that they don't play a close half guard like you would think with if you were like getting a dogfight half guard where you wanted an underhook and getting a dog fight or certainly like a lockdown half guard, which is very very close. They were playing this sort of distance. Eating half guard and the reason especially for Lachlan that he was doing that was he wanted to invert from half Garden to attack like so that was a kind of guard that I really noticed that people that were trying to set up leg attacks. They like that nice Shield half guard also in the women's division. You saw particularly some of Gabby Garcia's opponents opponents were making really good use of that knee Shield, but that was for a different reason. That's because it's a good way to keep large people offer you and this is something I can personally attest to you know rooster wait until And the second big guard that we saw in maybe this was even more dominant than the knee Shield half guard was the butterfly guard. This is sort of the the Gordon Ryan's kind of go to guard lock on geils really liked the butterfly half guard and it's interesting because even within it they have some kind of different takes on it. So, you know Lachlan seemed to go like a lot more knees out. Gordon was more like knees Point towards the ceiling but one thing that Gordon consistently did and I'm not sure why he did this was a lot of times he put his his hand directly behind them and he was on his backhand or he was on his back elbow and other competitors weren't necessarily doing that with her butterfly guard and it's no surprise both Lachlan and Gordon are leg lock guys Gordon has become a lot more well-rounded but you know he's obviously really skilled at leg locks and people that like to go for leg locks should be playing butterfly guard because butterfly guard offers some really good options for getting too eggs inside are even doing inversions which a lot of people were doing this weekend This episode of the podcast is brought to you by anchor FM which is how you're hearing the high percentage podcast right now. Anchor FM is a podcast hosting service that we've been using from the beginning and it is by far the easiest most user-friendly platform for those interested in podcasting but maybe a little intimidated by the technical setup side of things.

Okay, so we covered two things in the meta first was that there was a lot of guard plane and a lot of the really successful competitors were guard players, but they were many successful top players to I don't mean to exclude them second as far as positions that we saw a lot of we saw a lot of half guard and Butterfly guard particularly from like lockers I should mention I didn't plan to mention this but we did see tons of inversions all weekend long. And what was interesting about the inversions and tells you that it's very clearly a part of the meta was that different styles of jujitsu were doing inversion. So we saw a Geo Martinez the 10th plant style both him and Elvira and Thor were all doing in versions. But then we also saw of course Paulo me out doing invert attacks. I think we saw Kennedy doing invert inversion attacks and some of the female competitors were I'm them too. And they all had kind of different purposes for doing them. Who was the guy that beat a Luca slippery. I have to check because I'm going to be people are gonna be mad if I forget his name, okay, it was Dante Leone. He maybe had the upset of the tournament. He beat Luca slippery and he did it with inversions. But his were more sort of traditional backed a conversions and I think he took Luke. He definitely took Lucas's back once he might have taken it twice, but he just had some bro. Inversions that he was working in a couple of his matches. So what that tells you is that inversions are useful for different competitors with different sort of game plans and strengths and weaknesses. So it's something to look into if you're playing more of an open guard game particularly. If you're like Locker another Trend that I noticed this weekend was how important the back attack was and what I notice in this is again something that as I was watching it. I kind of like asteroid like hey, are you seeing this a lot? Lot the last couple days, which is that competitors were really not interested in being in the mounts and they were very not interested in being in side control. I really shallow side control for more than a couple seconds 80cc. You didn't see a whole lot of guys working attacks from the mount everyone wanted the back to the point where a lot of people would not even pass card. They would they would try to attack the back straight from inside people's guard. That's where kind of law the inversions came along. And also what you saw when people hit takedowns is they would go straight from a takedown and they would try to get to the back within you know, as fast as they could they weren't interested in doing those traditional pit stops that a lot of you know blue and purple belts would do which is you know, stop at side control, you know, take a second consolidate your win and your points and then go to the next thing and then go to the next thing these guys wanted to go straight there. Now, this could just be kind of in a DCC thing. Thing again because of the to shoulder rule which is that you saw a lot of competitors that they were trying to keep their shoulders off the mat and in doing so maybe they expose their back and it's also possible that at this really high level a lot of people have figured out that it's just almost impossible to pass some of these guys and girls guards. So it's better for them to just try to attack leg locks and kind of chain that with taking the back interesting thing is that Keenan Cornelius did a podcast in the summer. On Flow grappling and he kind of predicted this he said that in this was, you know way before atcc and he said the way noogie grappling is shaping up right now. I think that passing the guard is going to become less and less important because people are just going to be attacking leg locks from the garden if that doesn't work. They're going to tries to go straight for back takes and I definitely felt like that was happening at a TCC. Also worth noting that the rear naked choke was the top finisher 80cc again. I think I'm going from memory. I think there were 35 submissions and nine of those were rear naked choke 6. While we're on the subject of numbers, which is one of our favorite things at high percentage. I think the order of submissions was rnc's was the first heel hooks where the second and then the third was Guillotines and I was actually was very pleased to see this because this really matches up with a lot of the data that we've collected we've shown that in noogie matches the top-performing submissions across all belt levels are rear naked choke so Guillotines armbars and Now atcc heel hooks are a hundred percent legal. So they're going to be much more represented. Some of the research that we've done has been across different formats where different kinds of leg locks were not always legal. So when you're at the high level basically if you hooks your legal, they're going to be very well represented. But you know, we also showed that Guillotines were really high percentage at the noogie level, even though in the ghee we have other data that shows that there are very very low percentage. And the last thing that was very much on meta that we saw at a TCC was bodylock takedowns. So this is really interesting because body luck takedowns in the data that we've done at high percentage are not really anything special most people get better results from single legs sacrifice throws or just leg trips. So I don't think bodylock takedowns is necessarily going to translate to other formats, but A TCC a great example. This was JT Torres, which is that there were other competitors and I saw this throughout the weekend that we're trying to get single legs. But because you had to get both shoulders on the mat if you just kind of visualize in your head what a single leg looks at, its your entire body versus one of their legs. That's the kind of Jiu-Jitsu aspect of it. But really that's only good for kind of getting there. But down on the mat. There's you are not going to have upper body control. You have to let go of the leg and sort of All up and we definitely saw that atcc. So the competitors that had a lot of success were people that were doing bodylock takedowns or we're doing that kind of like double Leg Takedown where you know you land right on their on their diaphragm on their chest and then you effectively have upper body control and those takedowns in my experience are pretty Advanced take down. So, you know, you saw that there were some really good wrestlers like JT Torres that could pull those off. then everyone else I think just wisely made the calculation that hey why why I'll just I'll get in the guard and I'll try to work my game and get in a good position in the first half of the match and then if not, you know, we'll see what happens in overtime kind of thing now to kind of circle back to the question that was poised at the beginning of the podcast which is our leg locks still essentially The Meta kind of front and center and I would say yes for the time being they are we saw a lot of heel hook finishes. Some people commented that there were not as many leg locks is there were was in a TCC 2017 and if you look at the breakdown of the heel hooks, actually a lot of them happened in the absolute Division and a lot of them happens because of Lockland and getting I think he got like four leglock finishes three or four in his absolute run and that without him maybe the statistics would have kind of evened out a little bit. However, I would say he's not an anomaly because he He's able to go in there and make really good use of that skill set. One thing that I saw in a TCC is that I I felt like there was a clear distinction between the new school leg locking crew. That was at a TCC and some of the old school and old schools Probably sounds more pejorative than I mean it to be but we see this all the time in our gyms at home, which is there are some students and there. In some cases entire gyms that they just don't do the leg lock thing and maybe they learned defenses to it, but it's just not part of their repertoire. Some of it is, you know, the tradition and the history of it that some people just don't really believe in it may be an old school mentality kind of thing. But I definitely saw that ACC there was even a moment and this was a moment that was almost a metaphor for the entire thing. I'm talking about which is buchecha versus Gordon Ryan and Gordon Ryan. Was you know working his game and buchecha of course is a legendary competitor and he's known for having a pretty fundamental old school game. I think it's safe to say and there was a moment where buchecha was not faring. Well, I think he was down on points and he actually sat down for a leg attack and Gordon openly laughed at him and then buchecha started laughing in the middle of the match and then the entire audience tonal was chuckling for a Moment and the joke was is that you know buchecha would just he's not the guy that drops back for leg locks and I don't know why he did that. Maybe it was a desperation because he was down on points or something like that.	1.0
But the joke there was that he is part of a group of people in Brazilian jiu-jitsu that it's just not what they do. And as long as that divide exists, like locks are always going to be powerful because there's going to be a group of people that they're just going to work on. Oh, So that's sort of my ADC recap from a game theory perspective some of the big tournaments coming up between now and the end of the year think the big one is going to be the noogie worlds. And I think there's a couple in between that so I'm looking forward to kind of watching those and seeing what the trends are that we can learn from. There's a couple new studies that are in the pike at high percentage. I'm going to obviously keep doing the podcast if you want to check out my interviews with Tom to Blossom. Eddie Bravo, they're up on grappling Insider. You can just type in either my name or or one of their names into the search bar and we are starting to do a little bit more interviews as we get access to the athlete. So hopefully they'll be some exciting stuff coming up with that. I spent some time this week reorganizing the website because I felt like it was it was harder than it needed to be defined older articles. So what I did was I sort of read it all the categories and I think I have Some basic categories right now, which is Game Theory articles stats and research articles and podcasts articles and then all the articles I kind of like tag with their keywords. So if you are just looking for an article that you're not sure exists just try typing in the search bar should be a little bit easier to find than and spin the past. Yeah, that's just been a long-term thing that's been bugging me and I'm going to keep trying to make the website better. And of course make the podcast better. Thanks everyone for Or listening. I'll see you next week. Have a great week of training.	1.0
So you say something funny and then it beeps? He says something funny on command. We're testing it out fucking will be. So today mean Isabelle going to be talking about depression Isabel's my cyst and we both have depression. So that's why we're talking about it today both think we can offer some advice and just share our experiences with it. A lot of people say that they have depression when they don't and they're just sad so there's like a difference between being depressed and just sad so I'm going to read the DSM-5 criteria, so It says the individual must be experiencing 5 or more of these symptoms during a two-week period and they are depressed mood most of the day nearly everyday markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities most of the day nearly every day. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. A slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement that eager loss of energy nearly every day feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisiveness nearly every day recurrent thoughts of death recurrent suicidal ideation without specific plan or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. Rude, yeah, rude, they are so rude. That is so rude. Yeah. Hit me where it hurts the most. Yeah. Yeah, so When did you kind of realize like you have that like, oh shit moment. Like I have depression it was with you. Actually we were in we're going to see our dad and Florida and you're just hanging out on the beach and I said, I was 12 I said hey. Even when you get in the car, do you sometimes like like not want to put your seatbelt on just like if you get in a car accident, so you'll die in the not have to wake up and you said no. Nope, I don't remember that at all. Wow. Yeah, so I realized that no one else around you want to get hit by a bus. Yeah, and like everyone has different like Degrees of depression so when I say have depression, I mean very recently after our father passed away. I got depressed but I wouldn't say like I've clinical depression all the time. Mmm. It was a very depressed period of my life. Yeah, I wouldn't call myself depressed. But as you would, you know, well, that's a big difference to like there's a normal scale of like grief that people experience but mine was passed that they're like, there's no right way to grieve. Yeah. But I think my grief turned into severe depression because it lasted for like a year and it became well, that's when it persists. It's that's what it's different. Yeah, but it was far too hard DSM-5. Yes, but it was triggered by something. So whereas yours was just like always kind of present your whole life. Yeah. I can look back and be like, yeah like yeah, we saw that I would always say like and as well as also bipolar Sorry by pulling impressive. Yeah. Yeah, so but I remember thinking when I was six like there's a good Isabel on a bad Isabel and we pretend that she had an evil twin named Bethany. Oh, yeah, let's Bethenny. Yeah. And so whenever like we'd be eating at the dinner table, Bethany would be looking at me with like these dagger eyes and I feel like I can't tell my mom the Bethany's here. Like I have to pretend it's Isabelle like yeah, I get so nervous. Like Bethenny would be in the card. Like I remember just being terrified of When Bethenny came out no one was having a good day. Yeah savagery. Yeah, it was savagery. But I think one thing people don't realize about depression is how much of your life that you miss out on and just completely blank on like Olivia has this whole memory. I don't have any memory of it at all. I didn't remember Bethany until she just said Bethenny right now and like I'm assuming that's the right name, but I don't Bethenny, but I don't have a memory of it. We would do it at summer camp to to like freak out the kids out. Hmm. So and I was so used to it. It was so normal for me. Yeah, but other people I'm sure thought we were like crazy. Yeah. Is the point I'm trying to make is that depression can take away periods of your life with leaving you with no memory almost like holes and associating kind of not associating you look back and you don't remember anything. Yeah, like literally have memories that people have your brain is empty. Yeah. That's very sad. Emptiness is a good word. I think but it really do be like that. So I really do be like that it really do. I think this is like so after my dad died, I remember one day I was going on a run and I usually love to run but this run was hard and then all of a sudden I just started like sobbing. And like it hit me like then that I wanted to kill myself and like that's what I all I could think about the whole run was how is going to kill myself when I got home? No when I got home, but like in the future like when I was going to do it all this stuff and I just told my mom right away. I was just like this is very abnormal for me. Like I got put on an antidepressant and it helped immediately almost But that was a phase of my life where if I am afraid to go off my antidepressants because like what if I do have depression now mmm, you know, and it's just the medicine just works. So well, you know and it's not like that for everyone that comes so lucky that like it was a period, you know, definitely Well medicine is hard because it it only works just to such an extent where you kind of had to put in the work to you know what I mean? Like it'll give you the tool in your toolbox exact. It's not the whole box. Yeah, definitely. So on top of it to the Press since it doesn't mean you can just take a pill like go about your day. You actually have to actively like tell your brain. Hey, dude, shut the fuck up. Yeah, you'll lot of things you don't need. Kill yourself you genuinely don't ya and sometimes it's like reminding yourself like all the good things you have which sounds really cheesy but that's actually helped me a lot just sitting on my bedroom floor. I'm being present and being great. Yeah and like Isabel like it's so good. Like she'll go outside with her crystals and like charger crystals and do some like stretching like she didn't need to do that before she does things for herself now, like go to like comedy nights and stuff, which I think is really awesome. And she's definitely like has come a long way. It's all comes down. Down to just being kind to yourself. You can't be angry at yourself for not making progress every single day. You're not going to make progress every single day might regress. Yeah, you're going to live with it for your whole life. So you have to be kind to yourself about it and you have to reassure yourself. Like you're not always going to be in this mood and just kind of today not every day is going to be exactly and just keep encouraging yourself and being nice to yourself and the nicer you already yourself the more that like guilt that comes with depression will go away. I think that's kind of also how I knew that I had depression was because I had All this guilt for know that's a big part of it. Yeah, and I was just like there was a point where I was like calling people and saying sorry for things that I didn't even need to say sorry for her because I just couldn't fathom why I was feeling so bad about myself. Yeah. That was like I did something wrong, you know, like these people hate me and I think that's another thing with depression is like it really is storts your view about you're like purpose and your place on this earth like you really do think no one loves you sometime so definitely, but you're not lovable, you know. Mmm. or that it would be better off or you wouldn't be affected and like something that I've had a hard time with is just like I always tell myself now like most things aren't the end of the world. Which is a good thing, but also like the world's going to keep going, you know, yeah, definitely and I think that's a thing that people with depression is just like why am I here? Like, they're very smart people that are depressed. Oh, yeah, definitely have a lot like most people have a higher IQ if they're depressed because they just are so aware of everything that's like going on in the dusty. It's not like when everything is thriving in the world depression rates go up like it's directly correlated with kind of the state of things. Yeah, because people Like we're affected by each other quietly gently genuinely are affected by each other. If you're having a bad day. I I consider myself an empath. I don't have a good day either, you know, like if people that I really love like our are sad like, I can't be happy. Yeah are genuinely happy. For me, I just think it's like I think a lot of the problem is like depression in this first world country when you have all these Comforts is like I literally have no reason to be depressed right now that makes it worse and it makes you make yourself feel guilty. Did you just sit on it? The guilt? The guilt is a really interesting thing. Like I remember being like Five and like putting away like my first tour was ever was like putting away dishes in the dishwasher and there were like big forks and little forks. And I was like, I don't want to separate the little forks from the big Force because like the baby force them on me for seem to be together and I felt like I was like the worst human ever for doing that. You know what I mean? Like I always even then I always needed to have a reason for why I was guilty. Yeah, I would I just felt guilty because I was always so angry. Yeah. Like anger is a secondary emotion, you know? Yeah, definitely. Another thing about being this angry in this cute. Is that when you get angry everyone around you goes? No, you just make me like five to give or take an inch. Yeah, so normally takes us seriously. Yeah, definitely. People laugh when I get mad. Oh, yeah. That's how I know like, okay well, but they're like all that chipmunks having a bad day. I know. Oh, yeah. I feel like there's a lot of stories. I have that about depression that like a lot of things where I'm just like normal quote-unquote like morals neurotypical people just like wouldn't think this way mmm, you know, but like what are some like misconceptions you think about depression that That don't have it. Kind of like Get wrong. I just think the number one thing is that People aren't kind enough to people with depression. They're not patient enough and they expect too much. So they don't view it as something that's seriously chemicals are incorrect in your brain that affects you every day. That is almost like a physical weight on you every day when you wake up. That's not what they do it as they just say like they think you can snap out of it, especially if you're high functioning especially for high functioning like I go to work every single day. I work six days a week and every day someone tells me you like you make my day all the time. You always make me smile, you know, because I'm such a high-functioning depressive and the other day. I said, you know, I am really struggling right now think I got to go see a new therapist or something and there's this almost they said, oh you have depression and I said, yeah and they said I would have never guessed the yeah you had depression because the way you carry yourself. Yeah, it's just but that tape but they don't understand how much effort that takes out of someone. And almost when people tell me that sometimes I'm like, thank you honestly, but also like doesn't have a look. It doesn't have a not always. Yeah, it does sometimes like oh you can't like look at somebody like they're having a bad day. But like eyes exactly why I think it's important to talk about it because you wouldn't expect certain people you wouldn't expect to be depressed and they jammed the happiest people like yeah are depressed like Robin Williams, for example, he was very very depressed and he was always making people laugh. He said something really good about depression, which I think like we need to hear it out. It was like it was something along the lines of yes depression is a crippling illness that is not 100% Like people aren't 100% in control of but I also do believe that if you are not thinking the right things actively eating the right things actively hoping actively loving yourself actively. Then you are not giving yourself a Fighting Chance. That's so true. You cannot just give yourself with who? There was a point at school and I think I tend to get more depressed when I'm stressed and it is depression because like there was a point where I could not get out of my bed for eight days. Yeah. It did not leave my apartment for eight days and all I ate was Oreos. Yeah, and that just perpetuated the cycle. Like if I had healthy food, you know, I probably would have just been invented my like right mind but I literally as well knew I was calling her like crying. I'm like, I was depressed like it was hard. Yeah, and it's hard for me because like we were saying earlier like Olivia wasn't always. This way it was always me so then me seeing the way that I've always been on Libya someone who always be this happy. It was really hard. It was really see ya because a lot of people give me that way too and I wasn't fake either. It was very genuine. So after my dad died, I went on antipsychotics just because I was I needed to be stabilized because I wasn't doing well. I had a lot of PTSD. Yeah, and I didn't laugh for four months and it was the scariest thing because I felt like I couldn't Make emotions. Yeah, I didn't have emotions and it was Yep, jarring yet and that's why when my I feel like my my mood is kind of getting getting really bad. I don't immediately jump the gun and say, okay, let's medicate. I kind of step back and wait it out and be patient with myself and be kind to myself. You can look hopeful for towards the future and then you'll find so much better like think about how you coped back then even versus now like definitely changing holes in walls now you don't do that anymore. Yeah. I know. I'm 90. I can still punch a good hole in the wall. Yeah, I don't do that anymore. Yeah, I just go to hardcore shows. Yeah, we're it so punch other people. Where's okay to hit people. Yeah, they wanted they literally want it. Yeah, it's gonna pay for it. And another thing with depression finding those Outlets that you can be that place where you can see angry at. Yeah, there's always some anger like late and anger. You never really know about. Yeah, but that that bitching third grade Duty told if you're angry that I farted. Yeah when it was her, yeah. Yeah, that would make me angry still. Yeah. Yeah, but like I'm not saying you need to go but all your friends go to all your friends talk about how sad or angry you are, but I personally like my best friend. We love ranting to each other above pick things that make us angry to friend you leave that person to we're not each other's therapist, but it sounds fuck I fighting to fucking go off. You know what I mean? Like she's there to listen and she thinks it's funny. You know what I yeah, like again when I'm small but I'm angry like Funny regardless, yeah, so having that person that you guys kind of both enjoy and you feed off each others, like fuck this and you kind of just get that out for today Twitter was invented. That's why Twitter was invented. Yeah, honestly, like it's so good for like my depression because I'm just psyched about Twitter. Yeah. I heard about Twitter. My favorite thing about Twitter is when the mainstream media goes Okay, we're going to put together this story. For example Epstein yet committed suicide. Hope it works. They sends it out immediately Twitter. Oh how motherfucking convenient a billionaire with tons of dirt commit suicide. So K and it just immediately air quotes immediately on Twitter everyone blew up and was like, yeah. No and that's why I love Twitter. I love Twitter and it's a conglomerate a fucking Pete. I love those like memes that go viral. It's just like my depression my eating disorder my anxiety like all meeting up and it's like all those people doing the damn. Yeah, I love that like then it yeah, I mean, I think another another misconception that depressed people or mentally ill people have is mentally ill people have is that they're in this alone like no one understands what they're going through. That's not the fucking case. There are literally millions of people that feel actually exactly the way that you do and I'm sure neither of you can describe that feeling because it's okay and that's why No one thinks that anyone feels like them. Yes, but you have to communicate and be like no dude. I feel big sad sometimes to fix a big sad and that's okay. You know, I think another moment where I realized I had depression was where I was like laying down in bed with my friend and he was trying to tell me that like there was like more to life than like than what I was seeing and he was like people love you like your friends just all came over and you like made them all breakfast and like all the stuff and I was like, no one loves me like yeah, I'm like unlovable and I was crying and I didn't want anyone like like nothing anyone said could change the fact that I thought no one loved me. Yeah. Yep, or did I was like, there's nothing you can say and he was just like so sad like he was crying. Yeah, and I was like, why are you upset and he was like cuz I care about you and I was like, I don't know what yeah. Yeah, but once one time when I realized I was not in a good spot was when you my boyfriend, we're going to Chick-fil-A and big complex of just like people going and shopping and shit and there was like a really happy family of like a mom and a dad. Three kids. They're all like gigglin the kid was holding the mom's hand. I just gestured out the window and loudly said I don't want to see that. Really? Yeah, and then there was like Isabel, that's a perfectly Pleasant situation.	0.0
That was like gross.	0.0
Oh my gosh, you know just like secondhand anger at someone else's content with life if that makes any sense. Yeah, that's it. Again. You see how people in relationships and you're like fuck them. Yeah, that's like a big big thing that to this day. I'm working on conquering you know what I mean be another comes conception with depression is that one are going to be like done not suppress. That's not how fucking work. Yes, literally. It's just I mean it's going to keep coming back. So you better get used to it. You better be nice to yourself and you better learn how to tame it. It's like it goes thoughts feelings behaviors. Yeah. So like if you get a nasty thought try to cut it like nip it in. The bud isn't becomes a feeling in your feelings feel real now that it can become a behavior. Yep, you know, definitely it's a cycle so and yeah, then sometimes the behaviors could take over because So tired you can just sleep and it just feel everything perpetuates. Yeah the thing so literally it's to be as simple as being like this thought is wrong. Oh, my feelings are not real. Yeah. It's are valid control of your brand. Yeah. Absolutely. And again, that's the number one number. One thing I'm concerned about with people who just run to medicine is that they're not actually addressing the thoughts and taking control of them. They're just putting metal BT C BT exactly. Cognitive behavioral therapy not to because you have to find a good therapist though. My first therapist was like Olivia, you're straight. We all make it with our values and hotel rooms another big thing. That's big wrong. Yeah, but yeah another think therapists a good therapist not easy to find you now. I'm so sorry. I have a good one now. Yeah Isabel therapist actually yet. My I just I hadn't sanaka therapist. Yeah, one of my therapist was like yo look, I've seen you for a year now and this is what I think is going on. I could lose my license for this but I'm going to say it you're being haunted by a demon and I was like hon, I'm paying you $60. I'm paying you say. Yeah. I was a session to tell me that I have a fucking demon in me.	0.0
No that ain't it Chief. It's called depression.	0.0
Yeah, that's what it literally is a demon though, but in a different way, but she was like you need to go to literal like well, yeah. Fuck you, bitch. Yeah, and then she was like she tried to tell me that well, I was at the time I was like I was a lot younger so I was like so like, oh do I like girls and she was like, yeah demons can make you think homosexual thoughts and I was like, oh no, that's why I like titties. Like bitch know I like titties kiss titties are greater. Great.	0.0
Yeah.	1.0
Um, so yeah finding a professional that works will be that's not homophobic. That isn't crazy. ABS is not easy all the time. Genuinely and where that hasn't been through anything. So we're like well, maybe you should meditate. Yeah, you're just not going to buy with some of them. Yeah, like, you know, like when you're going to school if I go to like college, I went to UMass for three years and there were so many girls that were getting psyched agrees. That just made me laugh because I was like, you literally have no empathy but you don't understand through any psyche at all because you learn you can read about it in a book. Yeah you can read about Like anxiety, but if you don't have anxiety, you just don't know what it's like. Yeah, and these are the same girls that II that something goes wrong with their friends they call up their fucking mental health with their school and send them away. You know, like they do not there they do not know or care even to take the time to understand the emotion that you're feeling. Yeah. So I feel like a lot of it is just like making an effort to understand what your friends are going through and like my thing is Don't treat people the way you want to be treated treat them the way they want to be treated sometimes like yes and have you don't understand? Yeah, like yeah. We're not the same time just to say yeah, how can I support you? Hmm? Yeah, like I've been having a rough month my good friend just said what can I do to make sure that you're safe and to provide you support that's really weird. And if we're good sighs. Do you want to give you want to give your friend support? Yep, without being their therapist. You can still ask for support like that's where humans me. That you know, yep, and I literally told her send me a meme or two. I'll hit you up when I need you. Yeah, sometimes it's as simple as a setting for someone that's sad like so and just being like I'm here, you know living in talk. We cannot talk we can watch TV at like my presence shows that I care. Definitely. I don't have the words for it. Yeah, you know. So I guess that's how to help a depressed friend is just to be there for them. Yeah and like and not give up on them. Even if they don't come to all your social Gatherings key inviting them. Yeah, because they want to know the people still love them. Yeah, and that just reinforces like, oh no one loves me like, you know, just like invite them places, like even if they don't go like kind of have the expectation that like if you're like plans are going to like if you make plans with them like they might fall through and like that's okay like be kind to them. Yeah. Be understanding and if they're really pissed about something like I do is with my family too and like they probably need a little extra love. Yeah. Yeah and just let them be angry, you know exiled them a little extra love when they're feeling really intense emotions because even though that's when you want to love them the least until they needed the most definitely, you know, yeah like the other day. My mom was in a really really bad mood yelling at me for no reason and I instead of being like upset. I was just like I just walked up to her and gave her a hug and just it was just like how how like and she started crying and I wasn't so she was sad. Yeah, you know and I was just like so like I immediately was like, okay. She probably needs a little extra love definitely. These kids came into my work the other day and they said some sick shit. They were like, oh when I was a kid, I used to feed alka-seltzers to seagulls. So they would blow up what the heck and I literally like my heart actually started in my chest. I feel so sick and I just said dude. Can you come across the counter? I'm going to give you a hug because apparently your parents never Hugged you you don't just do that if you got hugs, so I came around the counter and I gave him a big hug. We said I'm a pretty messed-up guy that said you should go to therapy. You said, you know what? I'm considering it and then we talked about therapy. That's another thing and that see that is not the response. He was looking for he was looking for me to be like had a heavy that Titans of the bird. Hey Emma. No I said I said yo your parents didn't hug you. Yeah, that's it. That's an animal. You know what I mean? Like could have been like what kind of sick fuck are you would yeah, sick fuck regardless. Don't get me wrong. But do I want him to go on to be a serial killer? No show him. Why don't ya	1.0
Exactly.	1.0
Well those profound thank you. That really was that changed like that. I've been thinking about that later time again. I'm not always an upstanding citizen the other day saw kid wearing a trump shirt went up to him and said hey asshole dumb fucking shirt, and then I walked away. So like I am not always tolerant like that's that's not to say I'm always a fucking piece love ya person. Like I have my mole of unity respect. Yeah, you know Fleur Fleur life, baby. They'd always the case. But I try as hard as I can and that's all you can do. That's all you can do and again like that comes back to like kind of what I was talking about are just being kind to yourself. You know, you're going to make mistakes. You're going to fall back. It's okay, but if you're mean to yourself, you're going to sink down deeper into it. So what I used to do when I was in high school. Yeah. I know I'd be like, yeah, I fucking suck. Ooh, I'm going to go do this and then feel worse about myself and be like Oh, my life sucks. I'm like, yeah. Yeah for me. Yeah for me then your victim card gets maxed out and you're like I need to make some changes definitely, you know, there comes a point when you're just like damn it really be all me not all you but like well, no, it didn't a its. It says I don't know. It's just your responsibility to take care of it, but it's not your fault. No exactly. Yeah, because like you it's not your fault that your brain isn't firing neurons correctly and like you don't have enough chemicals. Of Serotonin or dopamine? You can't regulate go green like it's not your fault, but it is your responsibility to deal with it a hundred percent. Yeah, because you know, you don't want to be you don't want to be kind of putting out more sadness into the world if that makes sense. Yeah, if humans don't have a way out like if a cell doesn't have a way out it will die. Yeah, like it doesn't have any pores. Yeah, it will like become full of its own waste and die and that's like people if they don't have any Outlets they become I'm full of negativity and they can't Thrive. Yeah, you know really? Well that's where made up ourselves. Yeah, exactly. And so it's like just making those channels to connect with things that you really love isn't really important because if you get in the flow state where you're like, I'm forgetting that time is a thing. I'm forgetting about everything else like when you paint or like stuff like that like that's when You're happy. Yeah when you're going out, yeah, not even happy but just like it was kind of music and yeah concerts and dancing or after something you forget or moshing for a while pockets are the best or they make you remember when they play that one song. Yeah. It's remember that memory and just cried out. Yeah, that's so true. Yeah. A depression is a bitch it can make you think a lot of things that aren't true, but just know that. Your thoughts aren't always real and just note that even though it does not seem like it you have the ability to overcome it. Yeah, it's in you it's in all of it's not gonna happen overnight. Hmm definitely but it can get better and it does get better like speaking as someone in high school who's always thinking about dying. Yeah now I'm 22 almost I don't think about die every day definitely. It's good. Yeah, and if you obviously like this goes without saying almost like if you're feeling these negative thoughts like please tell someone like people want to hear it people would rather hear you complain then hear about you dying a hundred percent. So like there's outlets for that too. Like there's support groups. Like there's so many things you can try like so many things you can try and it's not like It's not like one thing it's not like maybe one thing is going to fix you. Like it's going to be a bunch of different things that you use in your little toolbox exactly to get better. So find a good therapist though. My first therapist was like Olivia your straight. We all make it with our values and hotel rooms enough.	1.0
Before we continue I want to take a quick break to tell you about anchor anchor is honestly the easiest way to make a podcast for starters it's free, which doesn't get any better than that.

So after I read this chapter to you if you are interested in getting the full version it is available again on amazon.com the chapter that I'm going to be reading today is chapter. For the beginning of the season now, you may be thinking the beginning of the Season that sounds like it should be chapter one.

You may be thinking finally we get to practice the answer is yes, and no, of course you get to practice once the season starts but there are still a few administrative tasks which need to be completed.	1.0
There's more to this coaching stuff than just running practice and playing games.	0.0
Although you will undoubtedly be ready to jump right in there are a few more tasks you need.	0.0
Take care of before you begin to actually start coaching.	0.0
The beginning of the season has a lot of formalities which need to take place including meeting with the families of your team and setting expectations establishing team rules ordering uniforms Mr. On the bright side. You actually get to start practice which is why you are drawn to coaching in the first place right meeting the parents meeting. The parents can be an intimidating situation unless you are from a small town where everyone knows Is everyone you'll be going into this meeting with no idea what personalities you'll encounter from. The get-go. Everyone will be extremely friendly. Most of them will be just as excited. As you are about the upcoming season will be eager to hear your plans for the team. However, this doesn't mean you can go into the meeting totally relaxed. And without preparation families will have questions for you. And the ones who will ask you questions are the ones who are not concerned with sugar coating their enquiries. This is why you try to address many of these Topics in a welcome speech / presentation. So you give off the vibe of being prepared and that you are fully capable of leading their daughters. Here are some examples of the questions. You might be asked at your first meeting of the year.	1.0
How long have you been coaching?	1.0
Did you play how much traveling are we going to do? How do you decide playing time? What uniforms are we getting? Can you give my daughter a ride when our practice is going to be? How do you think will do this year? Try to address as many of these questions as you can in your introduction to the team the fewer questions. There are the quicker everyone will get out of the meeting which busy parents appreciate additionally. If you answer some of these questions up front like how long have you been coaching? It will feel less like you're hiding things and you will see much more confident and trustworthy do your research have your ducks in a row and lay it all out on the table a sample introduction for a first-year coach could sound like this. Hello everyone. My name is Whitney Bartok. And this is my first year coaching volleyball. Although I'm new to coaching. I started playing volleyball when I was in sixth grade and have been playing ever since while in high school. I worked at every summer camp and even LED Camp my senior year. What I loved about coaching during Camp was seeing the girls develop their skills and watching their enthusiasm for the Game grow. Although it's my first year coaching. I know that this program has been very successful in the past. I plan to build on those successes with an aggressive playing style which still develops the Er Team you should then go over team rules which is detailed in subsequent sections established travel plans the possibility for any additional travel uniform ordering if not already in place practice schedules and team policies. Once your presentation is done open the floor for questions. You should have addressed most of the topics which apply to everyone so you may get individual questions at this point note that you can discuss individual questions afterwards, so the group can be dismissed. If you do not already have it have sheets, which families can complete and pass around at the meeting for contact information follow the meeting up with an email summarizing your points and reiterating any questions, which you answer during the meeting one final note. Although I often refer to family members as parents throughout these Pages Please be aware that sometimes you may be communicating with Aunts Uncles grandparents legal Guardians step parents cousins. The list goes on and on I And being inclusive in your speech because not everyone will have a mom and dad as their primary support system. I prefer to use the term family as often as possible since this has always captured everyone who is a legal guardian for my girls. So despite my use of the term parents on occasion. Please note the family structure for your players before you say anything which exclude someone who cares for one of your girls more paperwork. I know I know you thought you were done with paperwork, but I have good news for you.	1.0
This is fun.	1.0
Paperwork really before the season started you had to get all of your employment forms and certifications done. Now that you have your team chosen, there are a few more paperwork tasks, which you should do. This is a time when you can be creative. So embrace the fun that comes with coaching. If you're not the creative type. However, you can choose to find some of these items online and save yourself the time regardless of your coaching philosophy. You'll need to be clear about at least one topic during the season team rules while discipline is disgusting. A little later on discipline should only happen after team rules are broken after reading the discipline section create a list of your team rules and print out enough to give to each player and also to distribute to families at your first meeting together this way everyone knows what is expected of them and it's not caught off guard when you take disciplinary action, if you have different levels or kinds of discipline depending on the rule, which is broken list that out as well. Not only will this help deter rule-breaking, but it will also help you. A consistent once you've created your team rules, you need to hand them out to your players while you could just give the paper to each girl and hope she at least keeps it somewhere in her gym bag. I prefer to hand out team rules in a folder which I customized for each player. This could be as simple as writing their name and number in the top right-hand corner. You could get a little more crafty if that's what you're into and add stickers quotes drawings Etc on their folder. It might also be fun to have a folder decorating station at the beginning of this year. Meetings to keep the players entertained while you talk to the families younger players will probably appreciate this more but the right group of high schoolers might enjoy it just as much so why hand out folders when all you're doing is handing out team rules folder is generally more sturdy than the paper which will likely end up crumpled at the bottom of their bag next to a rogue sock which are not even sure is there's but now you have a safe place for other papers to go if needed say you're traveling for a tournament and want to hand out the information at practice. You'll be safe in the folder. Maybe you want to create a habit of writing down team and personal goals before each match that can go on the folder to you're helping yourself in the long run by giving them a safe place to store anything you think is important enough to print out and give to them later on in this book will look at keeping stats for your team in that chapter. I will give you tons of reasons to implement stat tracking in the beginning of your season, but I want to give you a tool now which will help you use stats for each individual on your team. Not just at the broad. Level if you search hard enough online, you can download a personal stat tracker for your players. This encourages one-on-one discussions with your players. If you have the time, but can also be an easy way to communicate about their individual performance and growth without having to use practice time to have these meetings. If you'd prefer to create your own personal stattrak or consider including the following spaces to communicate growth over the season serving percentage passing percentage setting percentage attacking percentage block. Aces assist digs and notes to demonstrate growth. I like to show the team and average percentage not including the most recent match or tournament. Then I have a column with the same stats, but for only the most recent match or tournament, this will show the players how their most recent performance Stacks up against their previous performance during my second year of coaching. I also included the team percentages so they could see where they were in relation to everyone else on the team. I decided to take the stat off of the form itself. Elf and instead share these numbers verbally team stats are a good measure which you should definitely track but you're adding insult to injury when someone realizes they're dragging down the team passing percentage every tournament. They'll know when you announce team stats. There's no reason to include it on their personal stat tracker. If you're going to have meetings after every competition to discuss individual progress, you can give players one sheet, which they can use all years track their stats if you prefer to hand out stats and only have meetings when necessary I Handing out a new sheet after every match or tournament one word of caution on personal stat trackers. Your players can take these very literally and the self-confidence of younger players, especially may suffer communicate with your team that they are a learning tool and cannot capture everything which a player brings to the team enthusiasm and teamwork are just as important, but those are hard to measure add positive comments in the notes section to discuss ways in which a player contributed that is not made obvious by the stats. Building trust and culture remember in the very beginning when I said that some parts of this book will have a greater impact on your season than others. Well, this is one of those areas and it is major right behind your coaching philosophy is your ability to build a positive and productive team culture and while coaching philosophy and culture are of the utmost importance. Your influence will not extend as far as you hope without first building trust to start. Let's talk about trust we all know in our gut when Trust someone or not, but what behaviors actually generate trust think back to your former coaches. Were you ever told you're going to get a lot of playing time today only to sit the bench like always or have you ever gone back to serve only to see your coach panic and call for a substitution, even though they weren't sure who they were going to put in or have you ever asked your coach about playing a new position or trying a new play been told? Yes, and then never get the opportunity these experiences likely deteriorated your trust in. Your coach and impacted your commitment to the team and their goals while it occasionally happens breaking promises to your players or not being prepared for certain situations on a regular basis is one of the quickest ways to fail as a leader of your team. So how do you build and maintain trust for starters? No your coaching philosophy. If you haven't taken the time yet go back to chapter 1 and do this now. This will show you your true coaching personality when you understand that you can create policies around. Values which you are more likely to follow even during high intensity and high-stress situations. How do you do that? It's mostly self-monitoring want to brighten someones day by telling them that they're going to get more playing time. Just don't even if your intention is to get them in don't tell them this a few hours before the match when you're still uncertain of all the playing conditions do they need a heads up? Yes, but only when you know for sure that they're going in not one you think it would be nice if you could get them more playing time. Or if they want to try a new position and you think the time is right let them know before I match so they can warm up in that position. Don't think you'll get them in need them in their regular position. Just tell them that delivering bad or unwanted news is hard. But if your players know that you're being honest with them the trust will build some pointers don't over promise if the answer is no say no explain decisions. If the situation calls for an explanation fight the urge to explain decisions other Eyes say what you mean follow through with promises. If you fail to meet a promise sincerely apologize behind only your coaching philosophy and Trust building team culture is one of the foundations of the Season which you need to make a priority your culture is essentially a mixture of the most dominant personalities on your team and your values in coaching volleyball and girls, especially it's important to maintain a positive and supportive culture.	1.0
This doesn't mean you have to start off each practice with a group hug.	0.0
Or give constant praise but the environment should encourage growth this can work for all coaching philosophies. Whether you see yourself as more of a drill sergeant or a cheerleader think about the behaviors and rituals you want to build into your culture. I'll share a few of my favorite experiences as a coach to get you started start by focusing on the values. You want to see in your players and the behaviors which would demonstrate those values that come up with a few reinforcements you'd like to use for each Behavior. Here are some of my personal favorites	1.0
Value aggression behaviors wanted hitting down balls and Diving reinforcement verbal praise celebrate passes give stickers value bench involvement behaviors wanted bench cheering ready to go in at all times suggestion plays during matches reinforcement keeping stats. Then cheers standing up value strategic play behaviors wanted Play calling Captain lead Huddle's reinforcements ask team to call a play and run it celebrate tips in open areas by understanding what you want out of your players. You are able to better communicate your expectations to them designing reinforcements ahead of time leaves only one task remaining implementation. Now try and come up with your own list bounce back and forth between your values and behaviors wanted then think of how you'll reinforce them. Consistency is key here. Make sure the reinforcements are something you can keep up with. Otherwise, the behaviors may not be consistent either. You might find that throughout the season you will add new behaviors to your wish list and you'll probably change some of your reinforcements if they aren't working and add new ones only change something if it absolutely does not work or if you find that you cannot keep up with it.	1.0
For example, I place a high value on aggressiveness during one of my years coaching Club. I took Valentine's Day cards to my girls at a tournament on February 14th.	1.0
Since I only had ten girls I brought along the extras with the intention of giving more out siblings who are at the tournament.	1.0
I had a ton of leftover stickers from the packet and halfway through the tournament one of my players pancake to ball which I absolutely love because it shows so much aggression and the implementation of skills. We were working on in practice the other team called a timeout and as my team came rushing in excited by the play.	1.0
I told that girl that she would get a heart sticker for such a great play. Everyone was excited and cheered more	1.0
And so began the ritual of giving out heart stickers for amazing plays my Setter chasing down a shanked past 20 feet behind the service line the back row player calling off a front row player to down ball a bad set instead of letting it get passed over these events happened often enough to keep the stickers in mind yet.	1.0
We're rare enough to be special probably once or twice a tournament.	1.0
My players got excited about it. I was excited about it.	1.0
It was easy to maintain and it reinforced the type of play. I wanted when someone would make a great play. There would usually be one or two girls yelling heart sticker. It was perfect fast forward to The Following season a few of the same girls are on my team and I'm excited to use stickers as bribery for good play yet again. I announce this to the team at our first meeting expecting the same excitement and enthusiasm which existed with my previous team. However, this group of girls was older and quite frankly not even mildly enthused about stickers Gotta Love high schoolers. I was a little taken aback. By their sideways glances and raised eyebrows, but just knew that once we started playing and they started earning their stickers. They would love it. This was never the case try as I might the stickers never stuck. I tried and tried but it eventually proved to be more of a distraction than a source of unity halfway through the season. I admitted defeat and ditched the stickers. If anything that experience taught me that I cannot force traditions on to a team, especially when they develop organically from a teammate. Up of completely different individuals. So when you are trying to create reinforcements of your preferred behaviors just be aware that some may not work as you planned and be okay with abandoning your efforts when you're positive. They won't catch on or work for your team. Try things out that worked for you when you played But realize that your team might not be as excited as you are just because something doesn't catch on initially doesn't mean it won't work. I enjoy mixing up teams and warm up Partners, but telling the girls to pick a new partner literally never works. And someone is always complaining it's horrible. I started asking my girls to line up alphabetically by their favorite color favorite flavor of gum favorite band Etc.	0.0
Then I just separate them down the middle or count off by twos to split them up.	0.0
Evenly when I start this with my teams. They all look at me as if I am treating them like children around the second or third week. They get more excited and their answers get weirder as they become more comfortable with everyone. This reinforcement bonds them all and gives them things to talk about A Works towards my value of the team getting along. It's weird. How much to girls can Bond over both loving turquoise discipline. You've already created rules and discuss them both with your players as well as their families. Everyone is on the same page. Let's say you have some pretty basic rules like no kicking the ball. No swearing no side conversations during Huddle's Etc. So what happens when one of your girls gasp breaks one of these rules, this is a major decision. You need to make before the season. Ins because the first time it happens it sets a precedent. Are you going to let it slide? Will you give out warning after warning yet do nothing about it in the end or will you stop everything and send your players to the service line and make them run until you think you get the point across drop in the middle of a match and do push-ups as former players. We probably all experienced differing disciplinary Styles coming from our coaches maybe even differences from the same coach depending on their mood the head coach may have been extremely strict while the assistant was. Mainly there to encourage the girls on your team while you don't come into your first season wondering what sort of punishment your team will serve for various offenses. It is something you need to decide on make sure your other coaches are on the same page. Not sure where to start think about this. The whole point of discipline is to make your girl stop some sort of behavior. Usually one. They know they shouldn't do but decide to engage in any way. The best punishment is one that they do not want and will therefore try to avoid some rules one, bro. Are more detrimental to the team than others kick a ball out of the way when peppering not good, but likely just a reflex give them a warning Buddha ball across the gym after missing a dig. She's sitting out no questions asked which leads me to my next point my personal approach to rule-breaking is this you break a rule you sit out everyone knows the rules and I don't have the time or patience to give warnings in very rare circumstances. I'll give a warning but because my team's know that I'm a no-nonsense coach when it comes to breaking the rules warnings are rarely necessary while different age groups will have different kinds of rule-breaking you need to decide on punishments which are consistent with your temperament and coaching style. I don't personally agree with punishments such as running lines push-ups laps. What have you this gives those activities a negative connotation and I want my girls to want to do those things to be in better shape. I do make one exception to running as discipline simply because a former coach of mine used it and I think it's genius Swearing was not allowed on the team. And if someone decided they were going to cuss the entire team will get mad at them. But why why would a player be mad at another player for breaking a rule depending on the number of letters in the word of choice? That is how many laps the team had to run but wait, it gets better the person who swore would stand in the middle of the court or jam and count the number of laps out loud for the rest of the team. My old coach used pure pressure against us to curb our attitudes I can Practically guarantee that if you implement this rule with your team swearing will be minimal whatever disciplinary policies you decide on make sure you stay consistent in your enforcement of the rules. Just because one of the girls who has never once gotten in trouble is having a side conversation during a huddle do not let it go fairness is something girls are very sensitive to particularly when they feel it is going against them giving up the perception of playing favorites can be just as damaging to their trust in you as if you are actually playing favorites. Practice design one of the topics I'm most passionate about when it comes to volleyball is practice design organizing skill practice and game like drills in a way that builds up and culminates in proper skill execution is vital to running a successful practice. It is crucial that you spend more than just a few minutes coming up with practice until you are a seasoned coach and even then you'll probably spend more time tweaking drills to make practice just right. So let's talk about practice design what I mean by practice design is the a flow of your practices from one major category of skill work or Play Games Etc on to the next to begin. You always need to warm up. This should take roughly 10 minutes for each practice to make sure your girls have warmed up their muscles properly the rest of how you spend your time will vary depending on how long your practices are with younger players practicing for shorter amounts of time usually and can be broken up as follows Dynamic stretching stretches that make your players move warm-up game a game. That gets the players moving and playing volleyball but uses them into play there should not include scrimmaging and should limit full serves or attacking right away games with a lot of movement are ideal skill demonstration and concept introduction explain a new skill or concept for this example. I'll use jousting Jousting is one two players on opposing chords go up to direct a ball that is tight to the net and could end up on either side. This may be too advanced for younger teams, but is a good skill to practice. Of 12 and under or middle school volleyball explanation should take no longer than five minutes unless it is very complex skill or concept specific drill. Now you run a drill which focuses on the new skill or Concept in our case jousting and sure you are running a drill which is slow down enough to focus on good technique, but quick enough to get a lot of touches on the ball and keep their attention game like activity which incorporates skill or concept similar to the warm-up game. We're not getting into full-on scrimmage. Out here. We just want to put the girls in a game situation in which has everyone practicing jousting as if it were happening in the game playing a short Court game where players can only tip will help the jousting situation arise more often old / familiar skill demonstration. Since Jousting is not typically one of the first skills you cover you are probably a few weeks or a month into your season by the time this comes up your team should be familiar with their defensive positions by now so you can review defense at this time. Sighs tip coverage as this is related to jousting scrimmage, which incorporates both skills and or concepts now is the time you get to test out how well your players have grasped the new information you have given them by running a full scrimmage. You are allowing your players to get in the habit of implementing their new skills in a way that would naturally occur in a game. Not one that is forced or predictable cool down. Your players have probably put a lot of effort into the last 15 to 20 minutes of practice and need to ease into their normal state. Cooldowns do not need to take very long but should not be skipped. Also, it's very important to incorporate water breaks for the team. If someone is thirsty during a drill that you should also allow them to get water right away schedule these in but make sure your players know that they can get water at any time. This is a safety issue. This does not by any means have to be followed religiously at every practice. However, if you are struggling to create a schedule for your practice in this might be a great place to start some nights, you may also have skills, which do not easily work. Whether using this framework, for example, you need to work on serving and setting it can be hard to make these two skills. Mesh.	1.0
Well using this practice design or you might need to spend an entire practice teaching service Eve.	0.0
That's fine. Just keep in mind a few pointers on one designing practices. Remember to keep explaining to a minimum unless it is a drill or concept which needs clarification and will be used multiple times throughout the season make sure skills practiced relate to any games played or are emphasized during scrimmages. Only start with foundational skills and build your way up. You can see where your players are at a might catch a few mistakes that would go unnoticed if you just jump into more advanced drills. Okay that was chapter for the beginning of your season from coaching volleyball a survival guide for your first season. I hope you all enjoyed this longer episode from get the pancake. If you're interested in getting yourself a copy of the full book, which is 10 chapters long and it takes you from your decision to coach all the way up to starting ear to it is available on Amazon both as an e-book and now in paperback. Just because it's on Amazon doesn't mean you can only read it on your Kindle. You can also get the Kindle app for your iPad. But if you are like me and many of the other coaches here the paperback version is great my intention for writing. This book was a to give you a heads-up about what's coming. If it's your first season and be to serve as a reference point for you throughout your season, I recommend you read through the whole book before you begin coaching, but then keep checking back throughout the season because things will come up that you're not expecting or you may forget about it in the beginning of the season and then in the middle of the Season you realize that you need to talk about burnout or something with your players. This book is great. For those of you who are coaching middle school high school or Club volleyball for the first time youth volleyball coaches. You will probably get a lot of value out of the book and if you're hoping to advance into Club coaching Maybe more Elite youth programs. This would be great for you just to give you a heads up as well. There aren't any drills in the book. But if you've ever been to get the pancake.com, you know that you can find a ton of volleyball drills online for free and you don't need to pay for them. Especially if you're just starting out.

Welcome to the foxy property chat pod cast I'm your host Jake shorter. And today I am joined by Jessica Dwyer of right at home staging which is located on the sapphire Coast in New South Wales. There's a couple of things in particular probably three that I found really interesting about this interview. The first one is that just is located in her business is located in a very Regional or even rural area and I guess we talked about some of the difficulties that she faces as part of that and I know that she's not alone in that in around Australia. We also talked about The fact that the her staging business is only one of two businesses that she runs she actually has a retail physical retail store as well. So I talked a bit about how that fits in with her staging business how it complements it and also the difficulties in running two businesses at the same time. And the third one that we get into is a little bit of an online shop idea that she's had to help increase or add another revenue streams part of her staging business and in particular she has set up a dream packages. That she sells locally to various people and and I found it really interesting. And I know that she's not alone in setting up an online store as a another source of Revenue. So we kind of talked about her thoughts behind it and what she has found very successful and difficult in saying that up. She also finishes, I guess the interview with an answer to my question which I often ask but don't get a great answer which is what is something weird or unusual that you love actually has a really good answer which I actually do the same thing. Going to tell you what it is yet. You have to listen to the end to get that but I suspect its more common than we both or then she realized I think it's actually probably more common in the general population. So listen and let me know how you go with that one. Enjoy the episode. Okay, I'm joined today by just for Dwight from right at home staging. How are you going? Yes, I'm good. Thank you Jake. How are you? Very well, welcome to the show.	1.0
Thanks for having me.	1.0
Glad to have you here. We did meet recently at the symposium. Dan in Sydney for the first time so that was kind of the first time that we met face-to-face and now we get to talk a little bit. I think what most of our interactions as they would be with most others in the industry are online and social media. So it's kind of nice to be do something a bit different.	1.0
I know when I saw baby in Sydney, I felt like I already knew her because we constantly are watching you on Instagram. So it's kind of nice, you know to finally meet in person and you're one that likes	1.0
To get in front of camera as you're doing things that I'm going to get into a little bit of that. But before we do that, I want to go right back to the start and ask what were you doing? Just before you got into the home staging industry.	1.0
I was living in Sydney working in corporate as a project manager.	1.0
Like I'm so completely different fields in you talking about kind of the the big industrial type projects or what sort of projects that we are you talking about so more	1.0
Technical so I was implementing EHR systems into lens Elise. And so I got into implementing EHR systems in quite a few of my previous roles. So it kind of just became my little niche and I think that's where I am quite good with all the technical side of things in business because that's my background.	1.0
Completely different to what you doing now for sure.	1.0
I know you're right. But I think the project management side of things does help me because it makes you be very organized and structured in how you complete projects.	1.0
So and probably just the eye and the fact that you're kind of used to thinking about things in a big picture and knowing where each of each little piece fits into that overall equation.	1.0
Yeah hundred percent.	1.0
Yeah cool as I Mention your business is called right at home staging and you're down on the sapphire Coast. Now, I now after meeting you in Sydney know where that is, but I didn't before that. So I don't just for in cases those listening that don't know whether Sapphire Coast is tell us where that is. And then I guess also how large of an area you your business covers.	1.0
Yes those the sapphire Coast is halfway between Sydney and Melbourne on the coast and the sapphire Coast is a collection of smaller. Pounds there is actually don't know the number of people in this area, but there is there is quite a few towns probably around ten towns that make up the sapphire coast. Probably even more actually actually feel that I should know that statistic. I'm sorry.	0.0
That's okay people can go and Google that and I guess how it when I talk about how far you have to travel is that what's the furthest you've had to travel for maybe to Stage your house.	1.0
Well the sir. Bicoastal, so I started at Burma gooey and I end it at Eden. So the distance from biggity-boom Acuity or even is around 45 minute drive. I have gone further up the coast path / McGeary to town called narooma and down many which is kind of a little bit further than that 45 minutes, but that's probably the proximity because any further and removalist costs as you would know increase so I try and keep A bit in that Circle. Okay, very good.	1.0
And I guess in terms of that, you know back in the early days when the business started. Was there anything in particular like a moment or was it more of a series of events that actually led to the decision to start the business?	1.0
Yeah, so it wasn't series of events. So my contractor Lend-Lease was coming to an end my lease at my unit in could you was coming to an end? And in all of that I had been following the twins from The Block on Instagram and I then say that they went and did some home staging course with this International Institute a home staging which was quite new to me. So then I am International Institute of home staging put on kind of a seminar in Sydney back in 2015, and I just thought I'll just go and see what it's all about. And that literally was my lightbulb moment. This is actually what I want to do for the rest of my life is home staging so there was a series of events and I think the universe kind of led me to that seminar that Naomi had put on in Sydney back in 2015. And the rest is history So within that three months of attending that seminar I was back in Beaker and rather home staging was born that's amazing how quickly it's happened.	1.0
So 20 2015. I said yeah about four years on now, I guess give us a little bit of so that's kind of that going back right to the start. So in the roughly for odd years that you've been in business to kind of tell me a little bit about well, maybe start with where the business is at now just to give people listening a bit of context. So, you know any sort of numbers that you can share, you know, the number of houses staged or how many properties you look after employees anything anything at all that can give a bit of context.	1.0
Yeah, so Nearly four years and I think I've got about Well Properties staged at the moment and that could be a combination of vacant or occupied homes. I do work closely with quite a few real estate agents in the area and I do have a couple of casual employees that helped me when I do have the larger jobs the vacant properties. So yeah, it's it's	1.0
Ring well, it's very exciting. And I guess it's something that I was a little bit naive probably being in Brisbane in the capital city. We had plenty of options when we started for hiring Furniture. So that that wasn't a limitation, you know, it was our real limitation was how much what you know, what happened we quickly could we build relationships with agents how quickly could we actually win some work and whatever work we were able to win it was either going to be constrained by you know, how many employees we had or how you know how we're going to actually fulfill. The orders whereas now I've met more people from Regional centers or rural sort of places something that didn't even cross. My mind was that there aren't even options to hire furniture and a lot of those places is that was that the case for you?	1.0
Yeah it was and so when I first started right at home staging I went into it thinking I'll just do pre-sale consults and I'll just get my experience through that but very very quickly. I realized that people wanted their In properties furnished and so I had to then go and every job I got where I needed Furniture. I would just buy for that house and it has just accumulated over time, but I don't have any higher options. I think Canberra is probably the closest and that's 3 hours away. So in a regional area, it is a huge investment at the beginning to grow your inventory and I have no regrets like I absolutely love it. But yeah, you do have to act like quite a lot. Yeah, no, definitely an egg because you've got your own stock.	1.0
Yeah and look so we kind of dismayed that decision to go down that path but we definitely had kind of a backup option there. But as I said, but yeah speaking to people from even Newcastle similar sort of thing there be closer to Sydney. So maybe they have some options there but hiring it's just almost taken for granted maybe or at least I took it for granted a little bit, but I guess as a follow-on Are there any other particular difficulties that you kind of face or that maybe we don't we're not aware of being in a couple of city that you faced in Regional areas.	1.0
Storage is an issue. So attending the Symposium recently instead need hearing the storage company get up on stage and talk about how they can offer all these things to stages. Like we just don't have any of that down here and I'm sure in a lot of regional areas don't have that access. So storage is quite expensive down here removalists are expensive. So I've been lucky to find a couple of guys who do Up me, they're not a furniture removal us as such with the truck, but they are very good to me and they do look after my friend nature when we are moving it. But also the biggest challenge that I've found is is actually educating people about what home staging actually is in the area when I first started right at home staging II overheard my dad telling someone what right at home staging was all about and he got it completely wrong, so I had to tell my parents It's like basically gave them a script on what home staging does so and to this day I still find it's an education piece with everybody on home staging and how it can benefit them when they're selling their home, which is a very yeah, I agree and it's it could be quite difficult because you not only selling yourself.	0.0
Now, you're also having to First even like say educate what what your service is what you do and then it's well, why am I the best person to provide that and often that can just be a road like this? This I mean in every city everybody will come across the same thing. I'm sure but like we've found over the last couple of years. It's certainly come a long way in terms of the number of agents who are now styling more than they don't. Whereas along when we started we certainly saw a lot of agents who were you know, the number of times I heard all we don't need that to sell a house, you know, I'll sell the house myself. And yes, I can imagine that in Rich happen. Yeah.	0.0
Ever done it in the city, but I imagine it would be a little bit harder. But also I'm finding now that my clients are actually asking for staging when they go to their real estate agent or they're they're coming to me directly before they've even listed with an agent to get staging. So yeah, I'm slowly slowly infiltrating. You know that whole education piece. It's a slow burn.	1.0
Definitely. Alright. Well look we kind of I know how much time and energy goes into starting and most and and money goes into starting and then running a staging company trying to build it, but that's not the only thing you have going on. You're also the owner or co-owner of a brick-and-mortar retail shop called the Hub home Trader I think is the name there. So tell me a little bit about that business and kind of how and why that was started.	1.0
So I like I had started right at home staging in. And just as I'd move back to be you this home where Shop opened up and it was amazing. I would go there and buy pieces for staging and then 12 months later or less the owner put it up for sale and my cousin just off the cuff said maybe we should buy it. That's what we did. We went in and we bought this home where shop and it actually is a real blessing in disguise for right at home staging because I can access A lot of products through the shop and also they kind of a good advertising for either side of the business. So if I use some art in runner home staging, you know, you can buy through the Hub so good cross promotion and it's a it's another creative outlet for me when I'm not staging so I really love it.	1.0
And I guess you're like you said, they're very complementary businesses. But at the end of the day, they're still two separate businesses and different. In the in the sense that although the obviously there's some crossover in the fact that you've got home Wares and things that you can use in staging as well one is still a retail store and one is a service. How do you find running two businesses that are very different at the same time?	1.0
It can be very tiring. I do sometimes find it quite mentally draining because there is so many things that you need to do as a business owner and so for me, that's kind of doubled in both businesses. I'm my cousin Amanda who owns The Hub with me we have found it quite difficult because we've never run a retail shop before and at the moment retail is in a recession in Australia. It's very quiet, but it is quite tiring at times but also very rewarding as cliché as that sounds I don't I couldn't imagine my life without either business.	0.0
This is like one of those questions who's your favorite kid, but any any preference? Oh, yeah. Yeah.	1.0
Me will always be my favorite child. Like I have I have Big Dreams for right at home staging and the Hub just comes in as a really nice complementary side business. Yeah, there's no there's no secret about that. Who's my favorite child?	1.0
Very good. Well, maybe I'll touch on that comment that the Big Dreams for the business at the end. But before I go into that something that's kind of related in a way to the retail side or the or the fact that there's almost this second business or what what I'm seeing in the industry from particularly from some of the staging businesses who have been in business for a little while and looking to add other revenue streams. I'm seeing little online stores pop-up not too common. But I've seen a few come up on the websites and and look it does make sense given that we do all this research when we're sourcing the Quality Furniture and we can often get better pricing through trade discounts or wholesale pricing. So I understand it and I think you've kind of done this in a clever way. Not only that you've got the That we just talked about but you also have done I guess it kind of an online just store but you've specifically called them bedroom packages and you've set up it this online store to sell what is essentially Furniture but in a bedroom package and I haven't seen that done quite the same anywhere else. So I you know, I'm really interested in the thought process behind or you know, how you came about deciding to do something like this or testing it out and kind of how you found it.	1.0
So The thought came about because that at one point I can't even remember when I launched the bedroom packages, but if this was quiet and I needed to create another income stream because when you're not staging properties, you need to find that how you've got to pay your bills, right? So I thought these bedroom packages would be a really nice idea because I had clients that would say to me. Oh, I just want you. Come in and transform my bedroom and just do it. I'll pay you so I kept getting these little hints from people. So I thought I'll try and make it a reality and it's a really simple concept that you can purchase a bedroom accessory pack and instantly your bedroom is made over with beautiful art and cushions and lights and it was really well received and I then started working on living room accessory packs. Kind of a similar idea. We just add the artwork in the cushions and the lamps but it all is in a theme.	1.0
So hopefully that will be launched soon and I guess going back to my be the overall online store idea because I've seen other ones where similar sort of things but bedroom packs around the furniture more than just the the kind of the lighter or the smaller pieces and look. I don't have any experience at all. But my initial response to when I see those is I'm a little Little about how well they would actually do not because it's about I think it's a great idea, but I often wonder what I look at those, you know, some of the prices for the full living room pack or Furniture whether there's actually much demand out there and and given that there's actually a lot of competition as you say retail is can is struggling on this at the moment. I imagine that's the case online as well and I guess it in an of a selfish it could be a time business, but it's kind of sitting as a second priority to for the most of These staging businesses as a second or complementary part of their business. So I guess I'm just wondering if somebody has no idea at all how well these things are near you've just said that you just received quite well. Have you found that it's something that buyers are all I guess. What do you think about others who are doing similar sort of things but in a Furniture space, do you think that they're actually going to be something that given our industry? It's actually received were Lords in demand or or my kind of missing the point a bit.	1.0
I think it's hard for me to say. Terms of buying a whole furniture package because they're I don't imagine they would be many people out there who would have no furniture to begin with maybe they just want to replace their lounge or their coffee table. That's why I think accessories are a lot easier to replace in a room as opposed to replacing your whole bed and bedside tables but also from where I'm coming from because I'm a regional person that shipping for me. He is very expensive. So I don't offer shipping for my bedroom packages. You would need to be a local to pick them up because shipping is just too expensive. I think probably in the cities the bedroom packages would probably work and be a bit more in demand. But yeah, it's hard. It's hard for me to say.	0.0
Yeah, it's and I should clarify. It's AI think it's a great idea it like I've potentially interested in looking into some sort of version of an And Shop, whatever form that takes. I'm just always every time but I've kind of always thought about it or talked about it. We kind of went back and said I don't know if that even is something that would work. So I mean it's interesting to what's good to hear that for yourself in the area or in that it has been received well, and it's just maybe somebody out there needs to try it and maybe we'll keep watch with interest.	1.0
Yeah. Well, I know quite a few home stages that have created that other Avenue of fairness. Fishing and styling airbnb's or holiday lips and I think maybe those complete bed furniture package is probably would complement that nicely if they are having to do an empty Air B&B. But yeah, I guess they changed cool.	1.0
Alright getting toward the end here and I guess now we're kind of looking a little bit more in retrospect or reflecting on your time. So as you said nearly four years in business, what would you say has been the most difficult thing that you've had to deal with?	1.0
And take that as broad or as narrow as you'd like, I think I think I spoke about it before was just educating people. I did find that quite a struggle at the beginning trying to even get in front of real estate agents and convince them that home staging was a benefit to them and it would help them sell properties faster. So that that's probably been my biggest hurdle and it's Still ongoing today.	0.0
Did you ever in the early days when cuz imagine that was even more difficult in the early days when you're still learning how to actually talk about it and educate did you ever think about quitting or no stopping what you're doing and changing into something different.	0.0
Not at all. No, no, and I still don't. I feel like I'm on a mission now to like take this business to the next level and just keep winning over real estate agents and winning over clients like trying to get to the clients before they get to the real estate agents if that makes sense.	1.0
Yep. So I guess going in talking about us a you mentioned Big Dreams before and take it to the next level. I'll that'll be my next question. But before I ask that one what are some of the things that you've noticed that are changing in our industry and in home?	1.0
Beijing in say call it the last six or 12 months, I think from where I sit just looking at say it Instagram the amount of home staging businesses that are popping up because it's such a new industry. I think it's becoming a lot more accepted as the way to Market your property when you're selling it you have pretty good of that that would have to be is yep.	1.0
Now that's that's yeah. I think I think I mentioned before you know in the last two years, especially I've seen the change in agents attitudes towards it but at the same time there's been a lot more businesses and people entering the industry and especially in Capital Cities. I think it's it's a very low barrier to actually enter the industry given you have these higher options or you know, I'm simplifying at a lot. So I'm being overly simplistic, but it is as simple as You can convince somebody to use you to style their home. You can do it tomorrow, you know, you can you can go to a higher company if you're in a capital city and you don't have to own anything. You don't have to actually outlay any costs other than your time obviously to build a business beyond that takes a lot more commitment and energy and cats and all those things. But you know in terms of setting up day one to test it's very easy to actually put your toe in the water if you were to go and like and I should also clarify that and say, you know, it took us a couple of Months before or phone calls and meetings before got our first job. So it's not as simple as that, but you know in I guess as you say young industry with low barrier to at least enter in the early years, it makes sense that we're seeing a lot of businesses pop up.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, and I mean, that's great. Well, I really love following all the different businesses on Instagram and watching them grow. You just reminded me of something that I was in my early. Sighs I did make contact with a lot of real estate agents and I didn't hear from a few of them and then at least 12 months later one of them replied to my email. So it's like they kind of knew were there but they didn't really need you with that time or they weren't really convinced. You could help them at that time that they they eventually came around. So it's a nice like pass very slow burn slow so bad. Yeah.	1.0
Alright Luke. I've kind of touched on a couple times. Let's ask the question. So you mentioned Big Dreams and take	1.0
The Next Step, what are your will you kind of thinking for your business as you look forward over the next 12 months five years what you know, tell us a little bit about what you've got coming like I don't have any solid plans, but you know when you visualize where you would be in five years, I do visualize my own truck my own Vans full time employees a massive Warehouse full of furniture and it's just a simple as that. We're a really well oiled machine of a business that He's in high demand on the sapphire Coast. That's a simple as what my dream is sometimes simple is better.	1.0
And I mean that's I think you'd better wouldn't be alone in what you've just described for a lot of businesses including ours in our own kind of little area.	1.0
Yeah, I mean small businesses tough enough. So I think you'd be keep it as simple as that then it can be I feel like it's achievable.	1.0
I don't think so. I mean you've talked about how much you've grown in four years. And I mean you obviously know the area well, so I think it's you know with as you say the industry is growing and changing and more agents are believing in staging the benefits. So yeah great great vision, I guess to set yourself.	1.0
He's off come back in five years and we can have will be what are we watching?	1.0
All right. Look, I'm we're down to just the rapid fire questions. I've got a few here. I do tend to Take longer than I want to but takers as quick or as long as you need for these questions and I will try not to interrupt or drawn out any longer than it needs to. Alright. So the first one is how has a failure or an apparent failure at the time set you up for a later success.	1.0
So I think I thought about this one and that there's two things that I want to say is that the first one is mine. I did touch on it before but when I was going through a by period in my business having to look at different income streams for staging so I created my packages and my style to stay service. So that was the first one and the second one and I think backup touched on this in her interview was that I had these staged a property and owner came back and said we had left scuffs all up and down the hall. We didn't and he never came back to me about it, but it was putting in a process of actually photographing the property before we even put Furniture into it so that we have evidence of anything that could go wrong afterwards. Yeah, that's it.	0.0
That's a good one. I'm sure that people listening will take that last bit of advice. Especially I'm sure we're not the only one that's had that okay. I yeah, it's like Could say more but I won't supposed to be fast. What is one of the best pieces almost worthwhile Investments that you've made whether that's time manage money energy anything like that.	1.0
Yeah again, I had a good thing about this one and I always just kept coming back to branding and I think this comes back to my corporate days where Brandon is so important the corporate company that I made sure that my brand was Sit up and it was consistent from the get-go. So, you know graphic design website all that stuff that kind of ties your whole brand concept together. It's probably one thing that I've been very mindful of since I registered my business name back in 2015.	1.0
How does this is a know? I said, I wouldn't do this but a little side question when you talk about branding as I mentioned before that you like to get in front of camera, and I've noticed on your website. Everything you're not shy about putting your face and telling people who you are, which I love I love them and I say it all the time to people people buy from people. So, I believe that letting people know who you are and what you're about can only be a benefit in your business. How are you? How does that tie into your branding?	1.0
So someone said to me once which I never forgot was that branding isn't just about your logo on your website. It's actually about you you the brand of your business and people want to see you. And they want to hear your story and they want to see how you can transform and that room from a vacant to a beautifully stubbed property. So I like I've not always been game enough to put my face onto Instagram stories. It's just something that I realized that people I actually got a lot more traction when I was being real and honest on camera, and I'm not shy to show the warts and all of home staging it isn't just about that beautiful. Sad room at the end of the day and I yeah, I think people really appreciate that but also in such a small Regional area. I think it's it's really good to put your face out there as well because people then just build that trust with you and your brand I guess. Yep couldn't agree more.	1.0
Okay couple to go. What advice do you wish you'd had when you started your business.	1.0
I probably would have started tracking my inventory from Okay, I started buying so much furniture and accessories that at the time I think it was you just get so carried away in how busy your business is and you know, you're trying to fill the many hats that you need to are in a small business that I just left. I didn't do an inventory list, so it wasn't until last year. I think it was where I actually started getting serious about documenting everything that right. At home staging had acquired over the four years to make my life easier because when you're standing in your shares and you need you know, 12 Euro pillows and three sets of bedside lamps and you've got no idea if you have those available or not. It's really hard.	0.0
So getting really organized with what you've purchased think that's a topic that could take up an entire podcast episode additional.	1.0
There's so many times. I've gone to the shops and bought things that I didn't need to buy because As they were sitting in one of the sheds that I could have used any way.	1.0
Yeah are enough. What is a bad piece of advice or a recommendation that you've heard in the home staging industry a piece of advice something for for people to maybe avoid or at least if they hear this some advice from that you would consider not be the best advice something that they would at least be a bit critical when they think about it.	1.0
Oh my gosh, I I actually have a blank on this one. I think maybe two sides of the coin from a client's perspective. This may not be answering your question directly Jake but from a client perspective their perception of home staging it could be quite an expensive investment or them and they might not want to spend that money to Stage a home to sell but then on the flip side. The home stages I guess wanting to come into the industry that it isn't there is so much more Blood Sweat and Tears involved in in home staging then just, you know, making a bed and fluffing pillows. Yeah, there's so much more involved. I think that's probably all I can give you at them.	1.0
That's okay. I'll take it. And the last one I have is what is it unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love and this one I have to say that I haven't had a good track. Or with this question in the past. So I'll see how we go.	1.0
So on the television when you turn up the volume, I always have to make sure the volume is on an even number. I can't have it on and off I'm with you on that.	1.0
I do that all the time. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure I'm sure that's actually more common than you think. I would actually that's a question for anyone listening if you actually do that, cuz I'm sure I'm convinced that that is more normal than we realize.	1.0
I feel like it would be and it's probably this. I meet people who make sure that they have to use like two or four pegs in there hanging out the washing no odd numbers. It doesn't make the sound of the TV any different there's it's just makes you feel better about what exactly yeah.	1.0
No, I like it. I like it. Alright last question is the easiest and that is where can people who want to follow along with your journey and what you're doing or even reach out and ask a question. What's the best place for people to do that?	1.0
So So Facebook or Instagram, I'm just found under right at home staging or my website right at home staging dot-com. I you excellent.	1.0
Alright, just well. Thank you very much for being on the show, and I hope the listeners got something out of it. And as I said if you're listening at home, and you firstly if you do that thing with the volume where it's got to be on an even number, I'd love to know the second Leaf. Please reach out and let just know that you listened and if you have any questions follow up with her, but thank you again Jess.	1.0

I don't know why people do that.	0.0
Why buy a Christmas tree?	0.0
It's because of Jesus Christ died in its time words were buy a tree put a lot of shit on it and then but wait, why are you little bit more? Yeah Presidents honor me and the most Pagan fashion possible.	0.0
Big fat and gone who's taking this down years ago in John New Haven. I like it years ago in New Haven Connecticut. There was a tree on the green that supposedly a Jesus face on it. And I've not seen the tree but I'm gonna guarantee you it did not have Jesus face on it. It's just like my God. That's a guess. It's a guess.	1.0
Here's why I say, why do you buy a tree so early by our tree in the 19th?	1.0
Can I explain to you? Why can I explain to you?	1.0
Why? Nope? That's all we have time for. We'll find out part 9.	1.0
The reason is Mom and buried she does she enjoys what you might like to call Aka hanging out with the tree. You're a so-so. We put what he'll say so we I know what you said. We put the tree up we decorate it and then she spends the month hanging out watching Lifetime and Hallmark fucking bullshit Christmas movies. I had to watch the fucking the the football game in the bedroom last night on our worst TV because she needs to hang out with the tree in the living room with the lights on and all that shit when she needs to maximize it as much as possible. So we get the tree this weekend.	0.0
The only reason we got it this early when you say hang out like you mean she will G near it. Yes. It's almost like a therapy tree. Sure. Yeah, but you know what? Hey, whatever floats your boat.	1.0
It's good for her but Thanksgiving was so late. Like it was the last week of the month, which normally is not maybe not normally know sometimes it's earlier. Sometimes it falls on like the 23rd or something, right? So the 28th is someone who wants I think was a 2087.	0.0
Yeah 28 28th, right?	1.0
I know your daughter. At the I know so it's a little late and she just wants to maximize the amount of weekends we have with it, especially since we go to Connecticut for like the week of Christmas. I'm not luck Todd's of the tree surviving when it's right next to the fucking radiator is not great.	0.0
Why do you go for so long the week of Christmas like wouldn't it be better just to go for like a night or two and then just like get back, you know, sometimes you know what we talked about this and another episode such everything you saying is is that it's know what	1.0

This is the last four or five years where we will invite our Jewish friends over and they'll their kids get to help because they're excited to decorate the truck in love it. And by the way, I don't know if I didn't agree with me, but I think decorating trees kind of a pain in the ass. I agree 1 million percent which is why I was getting people that are more excited and much more work. So it is great while I stand my end.	0.0
Google so we bought our tree on Saturday and because they fucked up the trunk as I said this on the live earlier, right? So like usually the tree place trims the trunk and trims the shitty branches the bottom of the tree cleans it up for you and I think because we bought a tree from like this look specials rack and we didn't realize it the guy didn't give us any fucking but he didn't even put it in the tree stand with a lot of times I do for you to have to worry about that. You didn't do that. So we get home and I get rid of some of these shitty branches and there's like two feet of just bear trunk. Mama Bear was not having it. So we didn't end up decorating on Saturday night. How tall is the tree at the end like four feet? No, it's actually still pretty tall because we got one without all that it was like bumping the top of the ceiling we have tall ceiling. Yeah, so we didn't end up decorating them Saturday night, which was the plan. So on Sunday morning. I had to saw part of the tree off with a hand saw and then we decorate it on Sunday afternoon and the entire time we're doing a time like I am so glad my nine-year-old is 9 years old so that he can decorate the tree so that I don't have I can do it except I still had to do wrap around with this is the worst part wrap around with the lights that and then like the beads and all that shit.	0.0
And then the I fucking I have a tweet about this where like my son's like hey, can I help decorate the tree? I'm like, I'm like sure he's like, what do we do with like what we put up the lights and then Mom and tell mommy tells us what we did wrong goes through and rearrange the lights and fixes the branches.	0.0

And basically we got through bedtime and a couple other times it's dinner time and some other shit and there's a lot of stuff we didn't get to and we had so many comments and so many different little topics within it that we wanted to finish it off. So that's what we're doing today and the first One of the top of the paper maybe not the top of the list but the top of the paper that I put together is homework. So today my kid gets home and he has to do like reading responses once a month where he has to do basically like a really brief book report on whatever book He's reading. I had to sit down with him and like help them structure it because like each there's three paragraphs and each one has to have kind of a different thing. I'm sitting with them and I much prefer this to math homework with him because the mass shit. I can't even do half it like it's getting more snow. He's in fourth grade is getting more sophisticated in the Common Core just the principles of it are tough. And before you start bashing Common Core. Yeah. I find it difficult. I understand the rationale behind it essentially is to give you like mechanisms be able to do math in your head in a more logical way the kind of the way that we do it like if you're breaking up a tip. You divide it by 10 you do all that shit right away with not really how we were taught. We were taught memorization and all that shit. Whatever. I'm not going to get in a comic or different app.	0.0
We already got a micro lesson on we definitely did some we did some writing but so like he uses the computer to write his thing and you know, how like spell check or like a grammar like if there's a proper noun.	1.0

So he types which is fine. It's the skill he needs to learn but like he can't deal with the red line that shows you that it's like a misspelling or a grammar issue or it's a proper noun and I fucking even knows what proper nouns I don't know when they learn that.	0.0
He's like, why is this show a red line? I'm like dude. I'm like that doesn't matter like you're writing on a fucking computer.	0.0
You can spell check and fix all this stuff later. You just got to get your thoughts out right and he can't fucking	0.0

I'm just fucking furious and it's too early to have a beer and you just like locked in this. Oh my God, and we are so similar. And we just it just it's a meltdown from the fucking start. G-dog Tha no idea if that's what I'm supposed to say GD OG Tha I like it you like when I break down the usernames got it figured out right on are in real time. She says not understanding the math getting them to do it and then whining the whole time yeah trying to break down the rationale behind someone like the Common Core techniques is beyond me half the time.	0.0
Well, I'm often I go I go right to the internet. I'm just like common YouTube videos and shit.	0.0
Yeah. Yeah, I don't really do that.	1.0

We have a big one that we've had but we don't we have to write so we have the big one and we have the umbrella one that you can fold up really easily and doesn't take up any space. We still do bring the stroller not every time but like as you know, it's going to be like, I don't want to walk anymore.	1.0

Welcome to the trail Runners experience with your host Daniel phrygia and Ashley dhruv now go and put your shoes on put your headphones in and let's go for a run. Good a trail Runners. Welcome to the trail Runners experience. I'm Daniel and I'm sitting here with Ashley. Dhruv. How you going? Mate?	1.0
I'm going well as a Daniel and I have already been talking this morning. So this is kind of yeah, but of a rehash, but yeah for this this morning, but very run out there for eight weeks. I've been really ill and it cancers just been kicking me a little bit and this morning I actually felt like a runner again, so It's a special day.	0.0
Yeah, that's good man night and you got your running legs back and you've recovered from black hole I dare say I wouldn't say that.	1.0
I'm recovering from black all yet.	1.0
I meant yeah together. Yeah, you definitely would be on the mend. Oh, yeah, definitely definitely fantastic. Yeah, so I'm as you know, I ran over the weekend and I competed in my Fifth attempt at the highest and 105 which is here in South Australia and it is with my fifth attempt and my third finish so I've dnf'd it twice the first time I dnf'd it back in 2013 and then I dnf'd again a couple of years later mostly through just sheer in experience and not really knowing enough, you know, but they're not dying.	1.0
About the course do not know enough about or not knowing enough enough about ultrarunning not know about that yourself, like all of the above. Can you tease that out for us?	1.0
Yeah, all the above are the first year was man of massively green behind the ears and it was a it happened to be a very hot year as well. It was the race was only a couple of years old at that point and I remember I ran out of water in 2013 I ran out of water going About the halfway point which is a really tough section because you you're alone for 22 kilometers and then but yeah, so ever since then I'm a lot more on to it with with what I'm going to like. I'm onto it more with just everything. I've learned a lot more about running about the course and about pacing and so yeah, so this year was it was it was a good run for me wasn't perfect. But I don't think they'll ever be a perfect race, but I'm very pleased with my time and I thought I might take you through a little bit and if I know there's some fruit if 10 is perfect.	1.0
What would you give it?	1.0
I'd give it a 0 to 10. So and it's perfect zero. Our bdnf.	0.0
Yeah, I got with a did probably call zero DNS Dion start. Let's go with it.	1.0
All right. Well, what's a dnf then like a 1 or a 2 then F all depends how far you get in the race?	1.0
I reckon hmm. That's a big advantage that one for yourself. But definitely think it did not start would be 0 because you didn't even stop.	1.0
Yeah. So let's go with tens tens awesome made it to the start line. So I guess I and I had a good time. I've got a PB I would All the it an eight and an eight.	1.0
Well, that's pretty good. Yeah, I say 80% 80% correct in a hundred K race. There's a bloody good race Yeah.	1.0
So basically I jumped in like conditions were pretty much perfect. So two days before on the Thursday the weather it was really hot was like 37 38 degrees here and you know, you sort of thought. It was going to be like that. They would have cooled the race off. And then thankfully it cooled down on Friday. I went from 38 down to about 15 degrees like was crazy and it was raining and windy and so didn't really want that either too cold to win. But then so the of the morning of the race it was cool, but clear and there what was a bit Breezy at the start line and But you really I'd rather be a little bit on the cold side at the start line and and which is you know, so it was perfect at no point did I think I'm too hot and so yeah really lucky in that regard. And so yeah, it took off with the crew. And so this is a lot of people who are listening who are local live in the south Australia area and know the race, so this will Echo a lot. So we've had a bit of rain here. So things were very green. So the whole course looks beautiful this show is awesome. And so lots of you run through lots and lots of farmland and through quite a few conservation parks and everything was just Lush and green and so we and it is just and I really did spend a lot of time really paying attention to the course around me even though I've seen it a lot and I know I'm very familiar with the course. I always try to make a point of being aware of the beauty and of what I'm doing rather than just focusing in on myself too much and being because I find when I focus in too much on my my what's going on in my head I end up falling into a hole and negativity hole. So yeah first I wanted to start out slowly and first 500 meters. I started out nice and slow and then we one of the things we do. In this race, you have to climb a lot of fences like Farm barbed wire fences and stuff. And so on the highest and Trail they have these Styles setup, which is like just a little steps that go over the fence and throughout the hundred case. There's probably dozens. There's so many of them you get so sick of them by the end and it just gets so hard to climb over the fences and it slows your right down and the very end so	1.0
Permanently or is this yes added by the race?	1.0
No, they're permanently. So the - okay the highest and Trail is a long distance trail that goes from the very bottom of the flu.	0.0
Yo Peninsula, which is down Echoes 1200 case, doesn't it?	1.0
Yeah, it does goes from Cape Jervis across the bottom of the floor area up sort of near Victor Harbor, which is nearer we start at y pinga and and then it goes up through the Adelaide Hills generally. Then across right past Mount lofty and right up into like sort of not far from the Clare Valley and and then you end up it finishes in the Flint North and the Flinders ranges like up in the desert. And so obviously we just covered the bit down on the this south of Adelaide and so basically going from wiping out to kaipo Forest for those who are not from here that doesn't really make any sense, but locals know all about About it. And first thing I will say if you're not from here, this is like becoming a really good 100K race. Like I've seen it grow over the time that I've been doing it and Ben Hawkins is the race director and who sort of the founder of ultrarunners essay and he's also a very good friend of mine. He has just he put his heart and soul into these races and he he goes he was so he was a crook as a dog on the day he could barely speak. Because he had and his wife is 38 weeks pregnant and he was there at you know, and he just from from Son Well Before Sunrise and too well to the very last Runner came in, you know, like he just you know, they'd lose race directors work hard and then also that the rest of the team like been pieman, pardon me and and Michelle Hanlon and probably a bunch of names. I'm going to forget plus all the a station volunteers. They all everyone just works really hard. At this race and this year was the best year. So anyway, I took off really fast. I'm running along I get to the first style to step over the thing so and hang on. Hang on.	1.0
Yep. So you've completely broken your own rule already I get taken off fast.	1.0
So I know I didn't take off fast. I'm jumping here because my brain doesn't work here - come on me. I'm still covering. I think I may have got got some brain damage. No, so I didn't take off fast. The first k I felt very comfortable first sort of 500 meters or so. I felt very comfortable. But there was a big pack of guys blocking the track in front and then we came came we came to the first style and climbing arnall and then you're waiting you just standing there and then I thought there's going to be so much of this waiting. And so what I did I thought I'm just going to get myself some space and I like so I jumped when I climbed over a style. I just accelerated and I broke away and I I just I wanted to put a bit of space between me and the group because I just got sick of this is where local knowledge comes into its own. Yeah, and so I known as I pushed her and I felt great which was a good feeling, you know, like I didn't feel like I was running threshold or anything else till conversational. But yes, I was running about five minute case in that first couple of kilometers and and running you're running through paddocks already and through long grass and and the lead At that point I was in second place. So Andrew Hoff who's a phenomenal Runner who I interviewed on the podcast a while back. He was already after a kilometer. He was already a couple hundred meters in front. And so and then he disappeared and went on to break the course record broke broke Brandon Davies course record, and I think he got 9 hours and 43 minutes so which is phenomenal and he's and I would dare say that and Who's not even in the best shape of his life yet? And so he's just a good runner. But anyway, so I'm running and I probably about the first ten kilometers. There's no major. There's a fair Climate about kilometer 6 to 7, where you go up this long road, we your dirt road and you just it's a it's a just a grinding uphill climb and there was me and this other this young bloke will running together second third for all of that and just we'll just check. But we will just sort of holding a reasonable pace and then we came down through the forest into Inman Valley which is checkpoint 1 and about that would be it about kilometer 16 and I was very quick turnaround. I got I filled up my my my bladder filled up grab some food said Thank you to the volunteers and then we were off again and So from from checkpoint one to the next checkpoint to is your where it starts to get a little bit tough, you know, so you there's only five checkpoints in the whole race. And so you really got to be self-sufficient and I was feeling really good at this point. I was just like yeah loving it conditions are good legs feel good. Everything felt good. So I kept running a bit well, and then there's a fair grind as you going up another Hill and you work your way on these Road Hills until You come to the first technical section, which is not until about kilometer 24 23 24, maybe. Yeah 24 and your head into my ponga Conservation Park, which is go so you're going from running on these dirt roads. It's very runnable, even though there's some climbing to the some of the most technical terrain you can get and it's a this is the part that breaks people really early. This is actually where I had my first low point. So you're going to my ponga their traffic is it just yet was there for a second?	1.0
Yep, what what makes that section technical. Is it Rocky? Is it steep is it doesn't twist and turn everybody what what sort of technical is it?	1.0
So the trail is very narrow and I'm in terms of like you've got those are grass trees. They used to call them black boys or not. Yes. Yeah, they're everywhere. And so you've got to hold your arms. Out in front of you very Rocky Trail and yet James changing direction constantly and then it's and then lots of ups and downs like so your one minute you'll be okay. So you can never get a consistent gate not even close and if you look on my almost rather, I went from running five and a half minute Kay's to nine-minute gaze to 11 minutes rise. And and so I was really it was hard to and I That was the point where I was like, okay, I need to put it is a slow down here for it. Yeah, you're pushing a little bit too hard too early. There's a couple of real steep lung busting climbs there. They're only so you're going up like 40% gradient, but it's only for probably 20 or 30 meters but there's lots of little climbs like that. So and then it's all those hands and knees kind of stuff, you know, like and then and and it's very easy to get lost in that section and I know for a fact A fact that a lot of people did get lost taking because this is Trails going off in every conceivable Direction into the scrub and it's beautiful, but I don't know it can it's a little bit too moralizing and that section goes on for maybe 4 or 5 kilometers. I get so does seem to go on then you're going through paddocks and then you go on to more Road and then so about kilometer 30 you hit the road or 31 and then it's about On ches to the next aid station, so to a checkpoint two and that's where my first drop bag was. So I got there feeling not fantastic but not terrible. Like I was all right, and I remember coming through there in about three and a half hours, which was I was happy with the time that I was there even though I just so I slow it up a little bit but I was still passing other because it was a group of people that started at six o'clock. So the slower waves started at 6 a.m. M and the faster wave started at 7:00 a.m. So at that point I caught a few of the six o'clock wave people wouldn't always say hello on the way through I saw at all that shout out to Dion who is one of the ladies I used to coach who completed High School 105 last year and she is an absolute Legend and I coach to through that last year and she gave me a big hug at checkpoint 2, which is really just You know that kind of just really lifted my spirits. So yeah, so checkpoint to grab my bag. I drop bag and stuffed in lots of food because the next section from checkpoint 2 to 3 is what I call the death zone. So it's basically it's the hardest section for multiple reasons. It's 22 kilometers between Aid stations. It's got more really technical climbing. And it's the most exposed section of the course as well. So we went through that and I thought okay if I can get through this next 22 kilometers in about 3 hours. I'll be happy. So so now going through going into what is called a just after the Aid Station you go into you'll T Conservation Park, which I always say it's like deja vu it feels the trails feel exactly like the previous. I should Park really Rocky and twisty and up and down and just like impossible to get a rhythm going and that goes for about a kilometer 30 37 or 38. Maybe maybe 36 2 plus 1 3 or 4 kilometers. I pulled out some pretty slow kilometers through that but I'd used I was feeling a bit negative in that point and I thought this is where I need to just back. Back off a little take the pressure off myself and just to get acknowledged that it's going to be slow. No matter what I do. And so I slowed down eight and I thought when I get out on the runnable sections, I'm going to run and and that's what I did. And by the time you get out to about a kilometer 40 you are certain you can sort of run a bit more you're running through these paddocks though with a grass is so long. Like I'm talking up around my past my waist. You're going through these Farms. Yeah. And it's it really likes get really itchy. You can't say yeah, you can't see the ground and sea running and you don't know whether you stepping in a hole or anything because it's where the cows have been. It's really uneven. So that's technical in a different way, you know like and so I but I managed to get through there without twisting my ankle too badly and I got to about kilometer 45 and I'm coming up on this road and I saw lots of cars coming around this country road and then I remembered that the race has changed this year and they now have a 60 kilometer and 37 and I was coming up on the very start of the 60 kilometer race literally as they were about to start and so perfect. I came in at the back and I was about 50 meters from the start line and heard the three two one and then they all started running and so for the next few case, I had people to run with which is fantastic, you know. It will lift and I think made the rice so much better having a having it finished that way and you run across the hindmarsh tears, which is sort of you this exposed and the road it's kind of endless paddocks and I'd say this is yeah. Like I said, it's the Death Zone on the hot days. It's really hard to get through this section. And then I was starting to I was feeling all right, and then I thought I'll smash some gel. Elle's and I've been I've been drinking my infinite fairly like a being a good boy making sure you're staying on top of my nutrition and my hydration and I had and then about you get to about kilometer 53 and you're at the top of this road called. Would Cone Road and it's it's a four kilometer downhill on on bitumen and dirt road all the way down to the aid station. So it's a real relief you get there and it's not too steep that it hurts but steeper. After you can get a nice roll on and I think what did I do? I was managed to get onto a decent pace through their back so might sort of my goal was every time I was on a runnable section was to try and get into the low six minutes per kilometer. And and on this on that section. I got down under six minutes days and just felt sad to feel good again came into the a station feeling great thinking. I've only got a marathon to go now and it got there. In six out and six and a half hours.	1.0
So basically that that's 22k section took me three hours like challenging said, you know, you're you know, you're an ultra Runner when you say I've only got a marathon to go now.	1.0
Yeah, exactly. I know other don't worry part of you is like, I've got a marathon to go that sucks. But then I was like no don't let that throw. It's a marathon yet only a marathon and but yeah and at that point, you know, you're starting to cross paths with more people. It was and then so I grabbed another at drop bag with some more food in it. And the next there's about 18 kilometres to checkpoint for and it checkpoint for I had my buddy run. I was coming on to join me for the last sort of 27 on ches. That was Aaron Cole batch and Aaron, it was great. So I sort of push through checkpoint to checkpoint for and you go through this section. It's my favorite part of the whole race even though about kilometer. He or the high 60s you're going up through what's it called Mount magnificent and into the fitness Conservation Park and it's just the so pretty through there like its Farmland at this is beautiful farm houses nestled in amongst these like really spectacular Rolling Green Hills. It is and the kind of Rocky, but they're also really green. It's just lovely and I really focused on Deserving that but also I focused on again anytime I could run I would run out hit the hills if it was a hill I would be if I was walking I was power hiking like I was really just wanted to keep my time to get my legs moving. And so I was at managing to power like it under 10 minutes per kilometer, which I was happy with so not nice work. Yeah pretty quick. There were people quicker than me at that. But you know, and at this point, I'd Fallen back a few places, but I sort of was focusing more on. And what I was doing and not worrying too much about the race itself and just worried about my own race. And then so again to check point for which was glorious and I for the first time I thought I'm gonna have a little sit-down at checkpoint for for a few minutes and that's that was my little reward for being very efficient through the previous age stations. It's at this point you at 77 km/h know you've really sort of broken its back and I Saw My Buddy Aaron and it was just you know reinvigorated me and it was funny though. My brain was getting a bit muddled as it is kind of now and I went to take something out of my back. My back was the first time I'd taken my pack off as well. I took my pack off briefly or took something out and I just somehow everything fell out of my pack and like I just had my shit everywhere and it's like I don't know how to put this back in and it's like I've been people laughing at me and And she's a really good atmosphere there and everyone just friendly and I got it all back in probably spent longer there at the age station that I really wanted to but you know it is what it is and it just some you know, it was not that was not part of the plan. But then with Aaron she just can't be honest and kept me running when I could run and made sure I kept sipping fluids and eating a beer and like it was a turn into a beautiful afternoon. Coming into the last sort of you come into kaipo forest from the last sort of twenty five k's and it's a pine Plantation. And so all right. Yeah. So pine trees everywhere. We've got a nice sort of feel and one going between farmland and pine plantations and like really I didn't have any like spectacularly low moments. I just I feel like I mean I was at low power low ish points, but I just was able to manage those low points better than I have in the past. So I'm really happy about that. And so my goal was always initially my main goal. I wanted to get under 12 hours, but I knew that was off the off the Record like 12 hours is pretty lofty goal one day one day one day but my next goal was to beat the Sun and so I thought I can still do that. So I had to do about under 13 hours to do that and I came into there's only nine kilometers between checkpoint four and five and I remember coming and so it's really nice short break. I grabbed a sat down had a ginger beer at checkpoint 5 didn't try to see there too long stuffed in some noodles. What took them on the go and I ate some of them and then had to ditch the rest because it was just getting a bit too hard to eat and I remember I had a what happened next? Yeah, then the last sort of 10 kilometers. Yeah, sad to feel a bit nauseous and then you know, but kept positive Aaron made me laugh and I was trying to high five as many volunteers and Spectators that I saw a long anyway, and then coming into the forest. I know the course really well the final and I actually from previous year. I had a landmark point where I knew. There was one kilometer to go but somehow this year I went past that last kilometer to go Mark and didn't notice and then I came around the other shit. The Finish Line was right in front of me was like just straight up by 200 meters and so some like always and I always was like somewhere I was able to leg it for the last couple of hundred meters and I managed to finish without using my head torch and not needing it probably if I was out for another 10 or 15 minutes. I would have had My head towards yeah, but I didn't need my head towards cross the line in 12 hours and 48 minutes and I'll start. Yeah, well, that's brilliant. Yeah, it's good.	1.0
When you have those, you know the goals that you kind of making up on the Fly. Hmm and you know, they're very like there's a very definite end time it's dark. I'm going to put a headlamp on yeah, you like you're aiming or I'm going to get out of this aid station in x amount of time, but still completing everything. I need to do like that. Just I love that sort of on the go. You'll make him. Yeah, you know you Got your big girls that you've written before hand. But those ones kind of come up to just kick you in the butt. You know, you kicking yourself in the button going. That's let's keep going. Let's keep going. So your big goals working and then you making up little goals to make it all come together.	1.0
Yeah. Exactly. No, it was good. It was such a good day. Like as always, you know, it's like an emotional roller coaster like with these there's things always are but I think when you the more experience you get get better. At riding that roller coaster and managing the roller coaster that makes sense. You know, you don't yeah, I just felt like it was I mean, I remember the first it was this familiar feelings. Like I yes, I know this feeling I've been this low before I can get out of it and then you know, I'll might eat a potato and now make me feel a bit better and it does it. I don't know. Yeah, it's weird but not as good and you know, like I say and some phenomenal This is one of the ladies I coach Jennifer at. Oh sir. She is 50 years old and she finished. I think I trained her little bit too. Well, I coached in a bit too. Well because she was only like 14 minutes behind me or something. And so thankfully, I mean not that it wouldn't be terrible if she'd beat me but you know, I'm competitive I don't you know, she she did really well and she was wrapped and up the first series. The name of the first woman and then was a lie someone I've never met her before. She probably had me on my half an hour but there's a lady named Sonia Jansen who I'd love to try and get on the podcast if she's listening and she she only had a baby six weeks ago. She's phenomenal, you know, like and she still did it in just on 13 hours, you know, like it's just an incredible performance. So lots of people that just blows my	1.0
Mind it really does.	1.0
Hmm.	1.0

My that's my recap of why someone I-5 and lots of fantastic stories out there and so many inspiring people, you know, like like always at these events and I mean I tell you what the Finish Line party pretty awesome there. It's like you're in the forest Pine Forest / eucalyptus Forest nearby as well. You've got it come up this sort of Avenue of trees to the Finish. One and there's these big raging bonfires going you've got music pumping just a really good vibe at the finish line. And I just yeah, it's got the and the finish line and it's like lounges set up everywhere. It's like if I wasn't so exhausted I would have been able to participate a lot more when I Collapse on the lands for a bit and then I went and slept in my car, but it was yeah, it's worth it just for the video Finish Line. And party. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so there that's it. Awesome. Yeah. Well done cheese it. Yeah, that's another one down. And now I'm just going to recover and so yeah today what's next for you.	1.0

Possibly something in January. So right. Okay. Yeah, but so this week's episode is a conversation we recorded with Lauren Che that correct? Yeah. All right. Yeah, so she's a good runner and she where does she live again? She lives like a good runner. She's putting a little yes the phenomena and she's crazy.

I met Lauren this year on the fishing belly rail trail first time that we met and from my point of view lines bit of machine when it comes to running. I don't know that she knows how to do anything else because it would appear that that's what she does all day long, but we'll get that confirmed or denied as we go through the next hour. I guess. It's welcome Laura. Thank you very much because it'll be him fantastic.	1.0
And so you're joining us from Brisbane. Is that correct?	1.0
Yeah, I actually didn't do know she's in the scenic rims over a little bit outside of Brisbane In The Sticks. Excellent. So yeah, get over. Yeah that little bit more people take it anymore the traffic getting have any counter and it will keep them off the road and life will be good. It's know what the rooms my oh, yeah your life. So I used to drive down the Boon of quite often because there is some beautiful rock climbing just outside of winner and I used to spend a lot of time. Yeah, my baby, but the closer than that, which is frog buttress. So yeah, pretty much. Yeah, absolutely beautiful and now French out of actually has two lichens that are only found on that rock face in the whole world so little bit of trivia there. You go. It's like you came second on the weekend in a 101 K rice named after the area women. I did I did. Yes. It was dumb the inaugural cynically Mantra and there were two courses that was the sort of course, which was not really short at all the 69 case and then there was the a hundred and nine point seven which K one and that's the one I do. Yep.	1.0
Out that was the cost like you're a tricky.	0.0
Yes. It was it was brutal and I was fortunate that I live nearby. So a lot of it. I have run on the floor but a lot of it was also on private land and so I hadn't seen quite a bit of the course, but I'm I mean it was beautiful and I loved it around here. The scenery is stunning and it's quite dry at the moment. So it is it's dark and brown, but it's mountainous. And there's the dam. But yeah, it was it was tough. It was very hot to everyone suffered in the heat myself included and I run in the middle of the day most days and yeah, it wasn't easy was it was really hard but that's what we doing. What are we doing to stop we go to Suffer Well, yep. You're the worst worst of conditions the better the suffering. Yes, a bit of the same flaws of the end. It was very unceasingly hot having said that for the number of races that I've been to or watched online this year in South East Queensland. It would appear that it's either been unceasingly hot or unceasingly cold during the actual races. It's just the way the year stand out. Yeah interesting. It makes you respect Mother Nature that	0.0
Sure, it's funny with the winner rise in the weather plays such a huge role and it's one thing with Avenue control. Yeah, so how do you cope with unfavorable conditions? Like what's your mind a certain mindset that you take into it, or do you just try and train your conditions?	0.0
Well II I train a lot In the Heat of the is it gets very cold here in the scenic real during winter and it's actually quite cold still here at night and in the morning, but during the day it's can get very warm especially in summer. I can only run after I drop my daughter off at school. I've have my own business and work from home. So normally I get up super early do some work dropped off at school. They both of my run after 9:00. And so it's really hot but even so the weekend Is so but but I guess I just know to really take it easy. I just dialed it back. I kind of knew what I was in for hate liars. That's not to say I didn't feel it. I've I did think I drank 17 made this place of water throughout the day went. Well, this is yeah, but that's not an exaggeration. Yeah, I just took it as slow and I just knew I just I guess I didn't know what I was doing for in terms of the weather. Yeah. I saw a lot of people. People really suffer. I felt terrible for them. It was a it was a hard day, but it was a great day still the bodies were fantastic at the checkpoints. The organizers did such a great job. Yeah.	0.0
I think we spoke to a few race directors on this podcast and I just I always I would I don't envy their position when the weather gets really hot and about There's been some races here in Adelaide with it. The race had to be cancelled when the temperature got I think it was forecast to be over 35 degrees. And that was this particular race. That was the cutoff point. When is that? We can't do it and people give it and I'm really good friends with this particular race director in the the cops. A lot of grief when he has to cancel the race, you know every yeah. Yeah, so I don't know why God have you ever been in a race where the weather has been so I mean obviously on the weekend, maybe go into more detail about that you drink 17 liters of water people suffered. Did you did it? Was it indicative of reflect your time you finish second. So like do you still remember on suffering equally it was a work day.	0.0
Yeah, and the field wasn't huge. I have to say a lot of people also dnf'd and there was the option to At a certain point you could decide if you wanted to continue doing a hundred and nine or instead do the 69k option and a few people chose that option. I was determined to finish. I want to buy cowboy hat, which is what you've got if you finish the hundred and nine case, but yeah, I don't know. I just um, I just pulled it along with you just want to always do just just put a lot to take a checkpoint to checkpoint Jenga homework. I do feel nauseous for myself. The day I felt quite it all I didn't eat a whole lot that. I really kept my fluids and electrolytes. And so yeah, that was more electrolytes taking it slow heat up. Yeah, excellent. And if you give to give the to give the listener and not some idea it was 10 degrees above 10 degrees Celsius above normal. So about 20 degrees Fahrenheit and probably a little bit less maybe 70 or 80 degrees Fahrenheit above the normal temperature. Tommy year so it was really a guy that gets fixed. It's a very exposed area there.	1.0
So what so time and you do not mind me asking I can't remember exactly was a bit under 18 hours.	1.0
I think so we started at 6:00 and I feel it's just before midnight. So look, I was pretty happy with that. I really this was the first event really wasn't sure what my time is going to be. Also, I did serve Christ two weeks ago. So I was a bit tired and you don't back on other ways mainly, so how are you managing your recovery between these all these big races? Well, I don't like tapering. I pretty much do everything. Everyone says you shouldn't do Don't really take the much. I hate it. This one I stop moving my body just seems to Fall to Pieces. So I just keep moving. Yeah, you know, I don't I didn't let the day after the skinny remote right was going to go for a walk. I would normally would in the end I didn't so, it's Monday. I went for a run today. I went to run I'm not huge like tip yesterday was 10ks today living pays and quite slow so down. I just watched. I just enjoy it. I have to keep moving and Yeah. Yeah, just what what's your version of the quite slow? What today was about six minute codes? Yeah, okay, because I was going to say because you can move so just run with you. You know, I couldn't I couldn't endure. I guess I'm not I wouldn't consider myself someone whom is faster Speedy, but I seem to be able to put along and keep going. So yeah just before	1.0
She was telling me that you do like in quite a lot of mileage and you yeah you so you'd knock out quite a bit of mileage when your daughters in school. And so what cop was an apology doing every week like on average.	0.0
On average, I guess about a hundred and thirty so usually between the hundred in it or a hundred and a hundred and seventeen days a week. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah, so that is being mileage and and obviously Joe do you use like are you training for of paint your pace going training on heart rate or just your perceived effort? Do you just do things like feel a lot or like, you know, maybe mainly feel yeah.	1.0
Don't have a coach. I've have never had a coach. I do things where I feel I guess. I don't have a plan as such I I know generally what I need to do like a long line of need to take it easy still if you interval sessions a week, but I don't if I have a set plan with this is what I'm doing each week and just kind of I can't really need to because life is hectic. I just have to fit around my daughter and my work as best as I can that are generally I'll do I do a lot of longer. ER well what I call mid-length runs so often I'll do a 20K run in the morning and then in the afternoon, I'll do strength training and all be fishing on the treadmill at the gym because I can take my daughter with me to cut. It has a bit of a muck around with the other cubes. And yeah, so that's right on the weekends. I usually do a longer run as well as I can but even so my long runs on the weekends. The time factor and not usually that long probably 40 K is most often even that long. Yeah, I know and so like let's go back in time.	1.0
Take us back to where you're running career sort of took off where did or when you first got into running and running long distances?	1.0
Like like you are now so when that couple start I'm 37 now and but I started biting I guess around 24 24 23 something like that. And it was just too I went to the gym instructor said he's doing a program for me it is like how far can you run on the treadmill my other brother and I didn't I didn't run and so well, so I just Start a street lights and street lights doll and it all went downhill from there. Basically first it was to lose weight and then, you know just loved it more than I did my first 5k first 12K, then my first half marathon which in I was living in Darwin at the time and I just I'll never forget that feeling a finish my first half marathon. It was just like I never in my dreams thought I'd be able to do that, but someone like me to do a half marathon. Um, yeah, it was a wonderful feeling and then you just keep pushing the envelope that bit further you people thinking maybe I could try doing this and that's just that's just how it happened to I've had some time off here and there in the past. I've got had been injured and when I was pregnant and after I had my daughter I had some time off but you're just the past maybe four years. I've really really got back into it.	1.0
Yeah, and I hear you ran quite well. The recent trip kind of century that correct.	1.0
Yeah, I think I got just under 12 hours. I think it was 11 hours 38 minutes. So I got my got a big mug, which was not a subject to be honest wasn't sure if I'd be able to achieve that but I did which was great because I did serve Coast last year and I'm I've got my little mug then I had a horrendous time. It says closed last year. I didn't realize it at the time but I actually had infected corneas and I ended up spending more in hospital. I had to go to him. DCI. Yes. It was the most the most painful thing. I've experienced besides childbirth. Yeah, so to go back and get under 12 hours was pretty cool. Yeah, it's amazing. How did he get infected corny is no idea. I don't know how I got infected couriers. I knew something was wrong. I thought it was. It was conjunctivitis, but then it became apparent that it was worse than that and I really didn't start but then I thought well if I could just make it to checkpoint to its DNS is better than a DNS and then at the checkpoint to my there's a few drawings. It was a long day. That is a huge blur in my mind. I don't remember it very well because I could barely see but one thing and I was it a lot of paid and apparently the weather was terrible, but that just didn't register with me at all because I had other things on my mind, you know, wow finished. Yeah, right seen hours.	0.0
You feel like a race like that with you know, something is pretty catastrophically wrong and where you battle through you feel like those races are worth forgetting or really holding costs and remembering because the embattled battled through everyone can relate to to go through something similar to that. What do you think?	0.0
I think they really important with this. It's not something I want to go through again, but I still appreciate the experience because I learned a lot about myself I squirted in and when the going gets tough and other races you think back to that if you keep going yeah. Yeah. Yeah it teaches you how deep you can go. That's right. When you think you've got nothing left. You usually got something left. Yeah, I might.	1.0
Yeah, so that's really good. And so now we interviewed someone who you know fairly well fairly recently interviewed his broke by the name of Carl for see how you know, come a little bit its colors my partner.	1.0
Discuss anything other than running we do you mean running is a big topic of conversation and I'm sorry, we do believe it or not do other things and have all that interested, you know for sure running is a passion for both of us and we do talk about a garage sale. Yeah, we've a savings of little bit differently. Sometimes other people I think laid back about this square is called can be very focused which is fantastic. It's kind of its. Yeah great. However, he could have a Golf and just put it out there. Whereas if I have a goal a bit more guarded about it. I'm not ready to put it out there that is just to put it out there and he'll achieve it. Yeah, he's a great brother. Yeah, he's definitely a good runner. I'm sure private you are so I want you to run through all of your races this year because just What kind of rice no with you but of wrong with you, it was run different events at the same main event and it would appear that I've taken weekends off and you've raced every weekend that's it seems to me so it seems like a year of writing. Well not quite every weekend. But yeah, I'm not a fan of taking time off. I just do as I said things. The fall off when I do that, but I did tell her we're in my life in February this year. I did the I do that with Carl and I did the Brisbane Valley real Colonel Marlowe this year, which I did last year and last year and I actually collapsed a few hundred meters from the finish it my body went into shock, but I've made it I made it to the end with 20 minutes to spare. So I made it I think. 29 hours 40 minutes and this year I finished third third be mailing or just over 21 hours. So I learned a lot from that from last year. I was going to climb so high this year, but it got cancelled. So I did my own bun a high of 50 around being on the same day. So if quote century and soon at your Mantra and a couple of other smaller ones as well, I've done the see that we were traveling series most of that this year and yeah. So you've done about a thousand cases of racing? Is here I'm not good at maths if you say so actually and it's about I think it's a lot. It's a lot of racing. Yeah in strawberryland stronger, but really to make it easier to get my runs on to run down under and love on the weekend just popped over 5,000 cases for the year. Oh, wow.	1.0
That's a lot more than me.	1.0
This is about double. Yeah. Yeah, it's more than ready to uh, 4400. Well, that's that's not far behind the actually that's great. Sorry. Like that's really what we haven't done anything at all last in the last six days. I have done 10K like just be the case. We'll fix that ready for black or will hopefully on Thursday said yeah, how you feeling about that? Well if the moment I had a chat with we had family discussion about yesterday or the day before and so we just went through cutoff times and my wife said to me five k's an hour you can warp that prong outlet and so that put the at this armor wasn't feeling very motivated. And sometimes I think the more wife doesn't like my running and then every so often she says something like that like just pull your finger out and do the work so Yes, I was actually very good with motivational and although I didn't have a very good not last thought I did run you stay and I'll probably run tonight with how I feel right now. So I look it will be 23 hours instead of what I would have originally liked but I think I'll get it right now. That's my thought. Anyway, there's nothing wrong with 23 hours is still covering that distance and it's an amazing amazing face. Yes, you should Fun. What do you mean to be? I'm happy. It won't be this horse. Yeah. Well, I'm hoping it doesn't pull with rain because a couple of years ago it rained all day and that was just that was not fun. I don't know. I wish I liked riding in the rain.	1.0
I don't then I will destroy you it doesn't it a whole day. I've my feet covered. What is your hope?	0.0
Honestly just to finish with you the past few weeks on just yeah, I don't have a time. It's called in fines just finish it and hopefully enjoy it. Let's go I could of course. I am not they don't get caught up in English applied to the stuff that I guess I did a bit easier and I did push it but I have to say I didn't do that. I didn't enjoy it because I was so focused on my time and my pay is looking at my watch. I would rather be somewhere in enjoy it. So yeah, hope you just to have a bit of fun. Yeah cat other people it seems in one piece. It's funny how I mean I'm guilty of this massively.	1.0
I mean, I'm a running coach and also a mouth as if I listened to the podcast nose and we get so fixated on top running for a certain time. I finished time and I and I had a client say Only once during the speed session and she'll quite often doesn't want to train with a watch on at all and not even know you're like your $10 digital watches you guys. She said she wishes it there was a watch it didn't measure your time, but measured your your enjoyment like so, you know, especially, you know, if only we had a way of measuring like other metrics for our run and so it'll be good. You know, you get to a point and your little watch says that you're enjoying yourself, you know, like do Native watch for that but because I didn't I get so I do I keep saying on on getting time goals the truck certain training sessions and and making sure I was getting heart rate goals and you know, all that stuff. And yes. Yeah, so I think you would probably you seem like the kind of person who would like to buy a watch. It measures your enjoyment and not your time.	1.0
Well, I wonder who'd Gadget person but I don't think I could run without of what should I do like to see See how far I've gone. But yeah, I definitely I just enjoyed the process. I just I like running and then the figures don't excite me so much the statistics of learning often forget my times have to ask how all the time someone to ask me what my finishing time is is what was it a hotel be? I searched for my favorite event. It's no longer in this sadly was the living to be encouraged challenged and that was well over two days and that list from O'Reilly's and learning to National Park and it was there a couple of different course options. But the one I did for two years was the double Marathon. So now it's on Monday get up the next day do it again. And that was that was a tough run but it was such a frenzy and Last week's events and I just had so much fun. Yeah, probably about was still on my night. There's a lamington classic which sounds similar but different that's actually been postponed this year because of the threat for the eyes. Yeah. Yeah. Let me to the Eco challenge was done by chania Adventures. They still do other events. Just let that one anymore. It's been running for the past couple of years. Yeah.	1.0
Well, do you have to have like a like a dream rice that you would like? to like to go and do	1.0
I'm really hoping to do my letter P until next year. I think I haven't done US World the closest thing. I've done to a stage races that money to be quite a challenge, but the idea of a stage race really appeals to lead us to get up each day and you know try and do something epic again, and I've never run anywhere like that before it's just looks fun. But yeah, I think that would be great.	1.0
Yeah. I've heard amazing things about running. Pins out and I know a few people who've done it and yeah, it's I hear it's quite pricey but I don't sort of events are have to be pricing to enter Because it loving logistic is a lot going on forever the races at Daddy but we have a race but I like the South Australia's version of run their Pinta. It's not a stage race, but we have the Hubert 100 down in the Flinders ranges you get and yeah. I'm there every year and it's a fantastic location. There's a 100K in a 100-mile option and there's a couple shorter off TV. Well, it seems like something that you'd be in. Juvie. And I know I'm always really innovating and some Americans the other day and I got I think I've convinced them to ensure it have an eye - you know there.	1.0
Yeah, I think that I think they will be out to do that rice. It's very pretty here with some great bargains. Yeah Larkins is awesome. Like Iran parts of that course last year and not running the actual race. I was just out there for part of my trip around Australia, which I was thinking Tom and the make those ranges out there. They just absolutely spectacular. Yeah, it looks amazing. I mean, there's no water so you've got to make sure you carry him off of That yeah, you know luck is no way you can like even if you ducked it like a yellow one of the righteous up here if you kind of run out of water you can duck off to a creek but there's nothing out there is no but it is the views as just something else especially first thing in the morning or late at night. It's yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Awesome. Now, I have a question. I need I need to know the best cow story there is no I'll say this to our viewers. It's Every time that I see Instagram post, yeah, you've got a picture of a cow and we begin it would appear that you just run from cow Paddock to capitec taking photographs of cats. So a lot of cars out here are the nights have been chased by pi was bloody scary. I love cows out here pretty freaky some acute, but most of them are so creepy. Yeah. It's scary fast. Thank you guy fast actually my day. Yeah, we do agree with that tonight when they get up and go their dog. Yeah. Well, I do a lot of running on my own most of it's on my mind and I'm going to entertain my little brain somehow. So I do take a lot of photos and put them on my Facebook page and make fun of myself. Do you do a very you do a very good job of taking photos of cows? And getting the perfect putting the putting this perfect captions to it. It's the largest is you look at the pattern. Yeah, but then you read the caption and you always end up doing yes. If you didn't jump did you actually burn that's the question exactly.	1.0
Yeah. I remember I think one of the first it's sort of funny the whole running the race photography like rice photos and really interesting because with the Advent, I don't know if you ever do parkrun or anything like that and I don't do it as often not your thing, but I know there's no path one here.	1.0
That knows the five k's, you know, I know Got a hundred cases one case is too hard, but it's a good Community environment.	1.0
You know, it's fun. Yeah, but there's always photos and park on and I feel like since parkrun photos. It's just like it's just every Saturday you get like an abundance of all my running friends are posting pictures of their parkrun photos. And I mean, I don't know I'm all for like sharing your running in that but I do Think you know, how many photos do we need to see if the same track it doing the same thing and I don't want to criticize Parker. It's just funny how many we get you get the same parkrun photos every week and it's just like my feed gets flooded you park on yeah.	1.0
I think it just got to try and have a bit of fun. But it's that means to be silly Chumps up photos or you know, whatever kind of photos. Well why not?	0.0
Yeah, so I have another question about your training. So you spend a fair bit of what I know about you spent your run by feel you don't really tape up but and you somewhere along the line you recover. I don't know how so you've obviously got a bit of a Natural disposition or maybe just from years of running until dropping pretty decent base, but do you ever have any major troubles with the engines?	1.0
I think because over the years. I've managed to beat my body into submission, but it does what it's told but I've been I might not have been running Ultras went. 13 years or whatever, but I've been still running for a long time and I think that counts for something and I do strength training as well. Which for me everyone's different. So a lot of others don't do it and they seem to get by fine, but strength training really works for me and it helps me with my endurance. Maybe I am a bit Lucky in a way that I can recover quickly, but I tend to think not I don't think it's love. I think it's just persistence and just at the cumulative effect of Many years ago breathing. Yeah, I'm lucky. I don't really get major injuries. I had had hip adductor tendonitis in the past. That was a number of years ago now and I couldn't mind for the good part of a year. And that was awfully I do have since playlist. I pretty much always have them but that's a pain I've When it's to make peace with I can handle it, that's about it. All right, I mean after a long run on the weekends, I do get sore the next day obviously, I don't walk though the best but I do bounce back pretty quickly. But again II tribute that to to making myself a move again quickly if I sit down I don't do anything for a few days. I feel terribly just yeah, although keep moving.	1.0
That sounds um, Interesting advice. Are you like this sort of active recovery approach? I think is good.	1.0
It's yeah, so yeah.	1.0
Well, that's I'm really glad that you don't have a major problem injury at think it's a it's sort of Testament. I think to just you running by feel and not sometimes you could probably better at listening to the body than a lot of other athletes myself included some time. I mean, I've had a few in I don't get into what I'm bit like you that I have had a couple of injuries this year, which is big It's train but you know, so yeah fantastic. So another thing that's going to bring up with you is sorry I jumped you again.	1.0
That's right.	1.0
So just recently here in Adelaide. We had the six day race. So the MI6 day. Yeah, the only one in the country and I spent a fair bit of time down there since very close to Mike to where I live and phenomenal like these guys so they run at one point four kilometer Loop. Around this path, which goes past the nice little like and they do it for six days. And it was just and it got quite warm we had the first couple days was windy and cold and then I got quite hot and we had I think the winning distance in the end was a local guy named Darren Darren Lenny who did 835 kilometers in six days and handling. Yeah was my blind. Yeah. But I just and I know there was some amazing performances right across the board like Annabelle Hepworth you I think he's from Queensland. She came she was second out right? And she said Chris Ryan Chris was there she was the second lady. She bought she did oversee.	1.0
Yeah. Okay, they both did overseas. She's amazing. Yeah, I know Christie's she's phenomenal. I've met her a few times at different running things have been kept in touch over Facebook. I've had the pleasure of seeing go finish the 200-mile event at bbrt this year and I ran with her last year for a little bit during the video team Viola. She was there when I had my moments at the end and help me in her parents also were there they were fantastic and Chris is just Yeah, she's the champion of champions. Yeah, I've gotta tell you that. She just gets it done. Yeah.	1.0
No, she was fantastic and I love these because this is something that you can do yourself or something like that at this point.	1.0
No, but I know I've said no to things in the past and they've done them. But at this point the thought of running around a little track for that long. Yeah, how about you? What I do. Yeah, the answer is I probably would ya he said what actually gets interesting. That's for sure. But yes, the truth is I would I would have a bash of that. Yeah, I think that would be oh, I think that would be a lot of men. To anguish in there for fun.	1.0
Yeah, so - yes, and you can go the ramp is a rule becomes a real sense of community because you see each other so often they were in I was down there for a couple of days helping out and just the camaraderie. It's magnified because you're passing each other all the time like you don't give chance. Yeah. So anyway, I wouldn't do the six day, but it's intriguing.	1.0
Okay, so there is not that big a town. In fact, I could I think I could I could run around it probably in half an hour to an hour. So imagine you yeah, really go. I imagine that you've read every single Street in Bruner itself. So do you have it? Okay. No, I don't run in town. I've been out of town. Yeah, I don't like running around the town streets. So I like it when it's nice and quiet. So I do a lot of writing on the outskirts of town and along the dirt roads and things like that and you have a favorite course out there or do you just pick something different every day? What I am a creature of habit. I do have my few different routes that I do that my favorite. Is this the Buddha chill illegal trial, which is hardly anyone seems to know about but it's a beautiful little The trail part of the seemingly multiples went along there, but it's nice that you I never see anyone there. It's beautiful. It's undulating. You can see Mount French lie because of the distance of most of its shaded which is unusual for around here. So that would probably be my favorite I can if I start from home you can do that 30 case I suppose those trails. And then next next year I'm going to do the 200 bomb idiotic. Well, maybe the plan. Various lists the various. Wa very nice. Yes. Excellent. Yeah, beautiful try. I'm terrified about Well, I can't say I saw Iran maybe 60 or 70 case on that trail last year. And in that time I think I saw three or four snakes are quite a while snakes on that trial. But yeah, I see a lot of things here. So yeah, that doesn't yeah, but look the run like along the beaches and so on. I just yeah, 'best of Vine country. That's Show this the whole of the logistics of what bothers me the most is getting there and all sort of all that out, but there will get there and you know be an experience. That's for sure. It's nice baby. Sorry, sorry good Daniel night and you go.	1.0
Oh just being able to with the logistic sides of these kinds of races even like a nigga like a hundred K race, you know, you've got getting you know getting to a location and getting making sure you've got all your drop bags and your mandatory gear and all that. So yeah, I can't even imagine of them 200-mile race, especially at this point to point in. Well, isn't it? So you are yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so that would be a massive challenge.	1.0
And that has worked out and that that cause covers like this go through the massive tree forest. And then you go like along the beach and then you go Inland and you go through waterways and you have to catch boats and we're one of the Sleep stations is I stayed there for four days and yeah, like you're going to get when you get there are things a hundred and twenty cases in so you'll be But that the wildlife in that spot is just outstanding. So what you'll get to see while you're out in the trial will just be mind-blowing really well. I mean, I'm excited and terrified. I'm looking forward to seeing a part of the country. I haven't been which is one of the reasons why Charlie so much because you just get to see beautiful places you otherwise I probably wouldn't it just looking forward to well looking forward to enter. Reading finding out what what happens after that because the longest Iran is a hundred and sixty-seven case just to see what happens after that point. Yeah. I don't know. It's all unknown so we can proceed to find out. Yeah, that's just it is the journey inside as well. That's not enough. That's right. Yep, dude.	1.0
Interesting. Do you find that doing Bryce? I mean, obviously you have to embrace that sort of dark applies inside that we all kind of go to some point. They like do you have like a strategy for dealing with the really- places in a race, you know, we need to go deeply into the dark Parts.	1.0
Yeah, that's ahead. Because every race is different sometimes the things that too bad like you enter your dark places that it's not that bad some reasons of I'm thinking of the baby are too though. Probably the worst to me when I last year. So I just think back to that if I'm feeling really bad I think back to that. I think this really is not that bad but things could get much worse and that helps me. Yeah, but I also Tell myself a lot if I'm starting to feel crap, and I just want it to end. I just tell myself for this this time is going to pass. Anyway, there's will spend it doing something Kick-Ass something I can talk about later and that helps me keep going, you know.	0.0
The truth to delay going inwards as long as possible really like to try and take in with my surroundings and that's the beauty of travel by me, you know, like focus on again the nice scenery or like a big beautiful Trend that we've seen or all the other Runners, you know? Yeah, I guess inevitably you end up, you know thinking going inside your own brain and then maybe mm. Yeah, I guess that all comes with experience that the more you do it the easier.	1.0
Yeah, that's right. And I also love music. So on the most of my training runs on could you every single training that I'm listening to something music or a podcast and during events? I tried not to like put it off until I do start feeling like I need something else to get me out of my life my brain and music really helps me and I'll sing along and I'll do my shredding a guitar and that really helps me. Yeah to me now. Hard parts of a run but I also think you just have to I think it's worse if you try and push the negativity away like just kind of embrace and then it will pass. Yeah, allow yourself to feel allow yourself to cry like I cried on the weekend. I was yeah, I had my low point but then once you get that out of your system pick up again, yeah, yeah.	1.0
What do you do?	1.0
What when I cry now when you let down when you're in the dark, it's interesting because what I was going to say, there is like when I go for a training run, I generally go for a training run to go in unless in letting you know like out for at the speed session or something and then you know, nothing happens my brains just blank but like if I if I'm where I generally go for a run. That's the reason I like to go running is to going woods, but when I'm right See, I spend meetings far too much time going inwards. And so that's when I like to chat to you know, someone else that I'm racing with and like a hilly course is brilliant for that because on a hill that apart from the elites there aren't too many people who run them. So even though you're puffing up a hill you can actually get you know, a broken conversation going and generally you'll pass like once you 10 10 caves in Two arrays generally then sitting with all the people you probably going to spend most of the rest of the race with and so you get to know people pretty well. And so you can you know, like they can pull you out and you can pull them out and I remember my strongest memory ever was a guy that I was passing and he was out of gels and he didn't realize it he asked if I could take a gel out he got to the stage where he was so wrecked. That the concept of taking his pack off and being out of jail was too much and I gave him one of my gels because he actually run out and there was no way that he was 15 case the next checkpoint and that giving him in my gel made me run faster than if I'd use the gel myself. Yeah because you have someone yeah, and it's and it helped him and after the race he came and thanked me and said I wouldn't you know, you would have never finished the rice if it wasn't for that. Yell at that moment. And yeah, that's probably my favorite memory of racing, you know in all my running. So that's that's my thoughts are going in and out and that's what's so beautiful about an altar and Ultra is it's an entire life in one quick run. Really? Everything is Chandni you end up crying end up hurting you end up falling you end up cheering you sing. You don't seem like there's just Everything in there and that's that's why I love it. So well, I guess I about Lauren's music choice to is she likes rock and roll. I keep trying to convince her to listen to an alternative to rock and roll, but I haven't convinced yet. Well, I do like lots of different kinds of music, but I think you like the Techno stuff which I'm not such a big bet on to say if you scolding you talk idiom. Okay, I don't even know what this is when I'm running.	1.0
Running a lighted on the old not running related.	1.0
I think a couple of running related ones on this is to actually listen to yours today the podcast on YouTube You'll and I have to say I was very impressed by your garage Funk bands that some played at the end of your episodes. Yeah. Oh honey.	1.0
That's that's really nice. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
I think humans are vulture. I think which Candace pert does she organizes like Todd Tahoe 211 at by the soft and I was on this weekend. Yeah and Ultra gonna put cars so they both US based ones though, but then pretty much the only running one. So I like to listen to fit a true crime and yeah docu-series. Arrange really I just decided many enjoy it because I'm why there's so much to choose from and I know what you say. I should that you'd like to run to go in with Aidan and I do too. Actually that's why I listen to my music helps me do that. But I also like to listen to podcast because I don't get to watch much TV at home with a six-year-old. She Reigns the TV here. Let's also get to watch entertainment c-23 all the time. the time	1.0
I have an approach sometimes it works is a good motivator. If I'm out is really struggling to define the energy to get out the door. I'll find a really good audio book or a really good point cast and I'll say I'm only allowed to listen to it when I run over as the only done and so that way I go are really one of us to that podcast. I better go for a run and then it gets me out the door and then once I've started yeah, yeah getting started is the hardest part half the time, you know, so. But yeah, but I mean it's yeah, it's really live in a good time. It enlightens time having all these like so many entertainment choices when they're out running and I think but the same time it is good just to tune in on itself. Like we're sort of going in and out of our own mind here this conversation like what but I think whatever works best, you know, like yeah, I agree.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, it is nice to turn it off and listen to Nature sometimes. But I just love listening to music I listen to all the time. I listen to it. I walk to school to pick up my daughter. I listen to when I'm working. Listen to what I'm running its. Yeah. Yeah.	1.0
So by next big question is what's on the horizon for the rest of this year not with as much as any few months left. So running wise you've got the race this the black all coming up.	1.0
Okay, so that's all so far this year. I don't have any other events. No, but then I just put just keep doing it and I there yesterday that bag thing again. That's just so I could see me. Oh well as to be done, I'm seriously wondering about taking no drop bags as time. It'll be a first But I'm seriously considering just whatever I carried from this top 400 case. That's it. You could easily do that. The checkpoints are so-called there. I just like to quite often. I don't use anything in my job. There's I just like to have them there. I figure if I don't need it, it's great. But at least it's there in case I do I feel the cold as well. So always have extra warm clothes in my drop bags. I hate being cold. I really suffered in the cold before during events. And yeah.	0.0
Make sure I had extra will close automatically when your when your time so hard to thermoregulate and so you are yes, and I'm on the same. I feel like I'm the first person that's going to get hypothermia in a race, you know, like I even I'm aware of it. So yeah, it's good to be aware of it. Do you have a pin your favorite food that you like to have during the race or	0.0
Oh I have music that is I have a lot of music bars. I don't do gels rarely. Will I have a job if I didn't have a home on the weekend might endure during the be a team on this year only will I have one if I need a little bit of caffeine on have a caffeinated gel on me but I have just food Just Like Music bars. I have scraps like rats with veggie my avocado or peanut butter and jam. I'm started having those fruit patches that you can get Supermarket. They're pretty good is easy to digest this. Whatever's going at the checkpoint chips a good machine and Ginger Beer Mile of our ginger beer is great. If you're feeling a bit funny in the stomach as chocolate-coated Ginger is really good. Just one of those is a really good pick me up. So yeah, probably all the food you shouldn't be eating I will have during an ultra. Yes if it tastes good. This food is fantastic. No, I think that's pretty well covered. Yeah, run run. I think I think the gyms out of today are run by Fuel run often. Don't go too fast and have fun. Yeah, and yes had fun. There's no rules in Rain. No dude there really is. I'm Hazel and enjoy it and you know if that means A hundred and seventy times a week like Lauren dust or let's go for yeah. Yeah, I think just don't be afraid of the bit of trial and error and don't let other people's definitions of successful. Whatever ideas of what you should or shouldn't do Define your ideas and goals. I think, you know, you know yourself better than anyone, you know to what you feel works for you and sometimes it might work. Sometimes it won't but you can only really know for sure if you dry. It someone can tell you. Oh, this won't work. But you won't really understand it in unless you try it so dude. Just don't worry. If you don't fit the mold, I think it's fantastic advice to forgetful advice.	1.0
Yeah, well Lauren that's been a perfect spot to end the podcast.	1.0
So absolute have have an awesome run at black hole and I - thank you.	1.0
Keep your friend of the friend of the podcast and I'll I would say	1.0

Thank you so much. Thank you for this thing. You asked Buckle to yes. Yeah, absolutely. All right. I'll be there to party at the back and the back. Yeah, absolutely. Alright. Thank you.	1.0

Hey everybody in this episode of the Riverdale after show will bring it down season 4 episode 2 chapter 59 Fast Times at Riverdale High Cheryl gets revenge Archie stands up for Reggie. And there's a mystery of brewing with Jughead. Oh baby Riverdale is back. Let's do it. I'm Maria Menounos and you're tuned in to AfterBuzz TV the ESPN of TV talk now. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Says that this is the time for the Riverdale after show right here AfterBuzz TV. Look at that. There we go. So nice you think I'm going to be going into are we announcing my tour dates at the end of the episode? Look everybody the river laughter show breaking down all the craziness that's happening there at for our teenagers there in Riverdale. I'm Frank Moran and I'm getting wolski. Hey guys, and as always like us on Facebook gives us five stars on iTunes. And subscribe to the YouTube channel and give us a thumbs up while you're there and you folks if you want to share your thoughts and opinions, we would love to hear them because the chat is up and running get a computer. That means it's all ready to go.	1.0
I'm looking at you guys everyone's excited. So we're excited. Let's go Frank. That's why everyone wants to dive in that's we're going to break it down.	1.0
We'll do some predictions. Maybe we'll find a new story or two to drop at the end of it as well. But before we dive in everything in detail, okay, what did you think overall overall very happy that were	1.0
To our Riverdale ways. And also I'm really excited that now Cheryl has a new enemy.	1.0
Yes. Yeah. It's a she's making a stand against mr. Honey.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited to see where this goes.	1.0
It was a semi can certainly last week and we talked about it was certainly a change of pace for the show, but it was a very nice emotional farewell look Perry, but we were both saying okay, once the craziness happening and this did not fail to deliver.	1.0
Yeah. Oh I'm excited. And I know it's only gonna get crazier from here.	1.0
I'm sorry. I feel like the craziest thing we need to talk about to is Cheryl Cheryl pause that she's got a rivalry with their the principle. That's Brewing. But there's one thing I want to talk about shell first case that we see her at the beginning of the episode. We saw last season that the way they were able to kind of make her think that her brother was alive is that they were they were faking that her brother was still alive, but now we see that she does have indeed the dead body of her brother in her the basement of this house.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, she's a little wacky. Probably not very healthy for her amazing.	0.0
She's got it locked away where no one else knows anybody that gets close to kind of going in that direction. She is right there saying no, there's nothing to see here Ray.	0.0
She also does really have anyone watching her though. So she kind of like lives alone, you know, so I think it gives them a little freedom to maybe keep a dead.	1.0
Be somewhere. I'm also thinking to you know, our hey, dude, you want to do Cheryl, you know, if you want to have that dead body cool, but maybe not put it just in front of just like Gates. We're so easy to see through the gates and see that dead body sitting over at the hand sticking out right one hand perfectly out for anyone to see keep that tucked away around the corner. Nobody's gonna see it. I don't know why she's not doing that.	0.0
Look, maybe she wants someone to find him and ask her about it. I don't know.	1.0
All right quick thought on Cherry Blossom. Okay. I think that she is gone over the bend. There's a cuckoo bird or because she's got her dead brother hanging out in her basement.	0.0
Yeah. No, she's definitely crazy definitely crazy, but she also has like her head on her shoulders. So I don't know. I think she just has some demons.	0.0
It's II war though. If Tony and her decided to part ways and she's left alone at this. The house with only Grandma Blossom. Oh boy and Jason's dead body as a really sources of conversation. She's gonna definitely not funny but only sources of conversation.	0.0
Yeah, which is not much so it definitely that would be a spiral for her. Yeah. I feel like we would definitely see her spiral if that ever happened.	1.0
So please don't Tony don't break up a Cheryl got to stick around we do definitely what we start the episode. Off with Jughead basically filling Us in that after the events of last episode saying goodbye to Fred for the rest of the summer the rest of the crew hanging out with Archie all the time. They got dinner with Matt pops all the time and it seemed like he was getting better and better as the days went on. Yeah, then it's time for the first day of school. We're here if you like the weird like hey, we're just gonna like have a nice hookup. Sesh before school starts.	1.0
Yeah. That was and I was like, oh, we're just gonna go Right into this. I mean, I'm happy that my like Fab Four everyone's back together. Everyone's happy in a relationship. But yeah, I mean, I guess you know, no one's parents are really around anymore and they're seniors. Yeah, I guess, you know get the Love on sure.	1.0
All right, but they have so much fun though that you forget to set the alarm. And of course you late for your first day senior class. Stay.	1.0
Come on guys, get it together ever been.	0.0
For school.	1.0
Yes easy for you to sneak in only one year when I had my art class my first period because my teacher would always be okay with it. As long as I grabbed her something on my way in. So if I got her like a granola bar or coffee or something, she would be okay with the 10-15 minutes late. You could bribe your way out of it just her thou so I she's not obviously like mr. Honey.	1.0
So it's true only late. Once and used to be like our for our school, they would you would check down there like a Scantron sheet where the teacher would kind of everybody was absent and then take it down take it and put it outside the door and me and to my friends got there late and then we just got that sheet and we erased we are absent and then we went off and we just hung out for like the rest of that our first of all you just took the hour off easy enough. Yes. We got away with it was great. So, yes you did you did mention. Mr. Honey, our new principal play biker Smith. Yeah how exciting yes, so certainly comes off as very very rules oriented Mmm Yeah, Mr. Strict. Yes, so there's going to be discipline.	1.0
There's going to be order it's going to be consequences, which we know does not go well with his group of friends. No. No, I mean they don't listen to anything.	0.0
I mean if you look at we have all the only principle we have to compare to us, mr. Wetherby who started off his out of rice and like Okay, but then he got sucked into the farm.	0.0
Yes. So he just kind of turned out to be wacky.	0.0
Yes. So, you know, I don't know for a for a high school. Do you need a very strict disciplinarian or do you need somebody that's gonna be compassionate and understanding I think you need some strictness.	0.0
Definitely because those are the years when I mean you're rebelling the most at least well, I feel like I did and I didn't want to do something or you know, I was like, oh No One's Gonna Know? It is if I just skip class or go out for lunch with the seniors or something or yeah come in late.	1.0
So how many times did you go to the principal's office?	1.0
Oh never. Oh, okay. Tardy. I didn't get enough tardies to get me to the principal's office.	0.0
Okay. All right, you weren't a disciplinary. I you don't need any disciplinary action.	0.0
No, but I think it is good just to have structure and to know that someone is Is there to give you consequences and you can't just go la li la di da keep doing you know those things.	0.0
Well one person has we've been kept on talking about your Blossom one person who does not respond well to you know challenges we're being told no right our good old pal Shiro Blossom share old good old Cheryl and she wants to throw a back to school dance. I mean, it's been a rough year last year. We had everything going on with the other group of the Gargoyles rough summer. Yes. Summer you'll let's celebrate with a dance, right? Yeah, and he says no no and but there's part of me that I guess kinda understand because he says, you know the last dance we had her people were murdered.	1.0
You know, that's true. Yeah, he doesn't really know anything about Riverdale too much or the high school. And I mean, right he only knows what he's heard or probably read. He hasn't been in the thick of all of it. So I think from an Don't perspective.	1.0
That's probably a normal decision, I guess because there's part of me that says like our the last time we had when somebody died so we shouldn't do that again, but then there's also the part of me too. It's like you got to get back on the horse, right?	1.0
Yeah. I mean, you can't just not have dances forever.	1.0
Yeah, so we should just get right back out and do them and make sure that we're having fun and get away from those. Terrible memories make fun ones.	1.0
Yeah. Mr. Honey. You should just make sure that it's a site safer environment.	1.0
Yeah, if you're all about order discipline, I feel like you could really set. But a nice security system in there to make sure nobody's going to get bothered.	1.0
Oh, yeah. Yeah definitely have some parents come and you know be there for the prom to like security what I do.	1.0
I'm trying to think of the right word a chaperone Debra come like a parental guidance that way but wouldn't this is one of your parents are chaperoning.	1.0
No, thank God my parents never did that.	0.0
I feel so uncomfortable when my parents would like. Hey, I'm going to chaperone. Dancing. No, it's already awkward enough as it is.	0.0
Yeah, I would be like I'm not going to go to the next one.	0.0
You can chaperone and I'll stay home it's fine. So we basically have our four characters that kind of setting up at least the initial bits of their storylines the season so we've got our Chang and with Mad Dog and we're like about Archie start to get like Mad Dog. Hey, why don't you finish school? Yeah. Well, there's going to finish doing freshman year. So why don't you finish it get your high school diploma.	1.0
I'm excited that mad dog is going to stay around for this season. I honestly thought that he wasn't going Come back since the storyline kind of died out.	1.0
It's Riverdale does a great thing of introducing a character then dropping them for you know, half a dozen episodes then bringing them up for a hot second but losing him well again, and so by the end of the end of the last season, we saw him hanging out with Archie saying oh, yeah, I'll have to run this Boxing Club, you know, to be honest by this time. I was like, yeah, we're just gonna move past. That was just a season 3 thing but no looks like we're going to be sticking around with Mad Dog hanging out in Archie's life, which I'm all for.	1.0
I'm excited and his name is Monroe. No more. Yeah, what a cool name. Like I love that name. And now I just want to call him Monroe and not mad dog is so much sweeter and nicer and I can't wait to get to see the sweet side of it. That's true.	1.0
But I have a crush maybe all right early predictors therefore o first time. Yes, so we've got our seed trying to live up to his father's reputation helping others. Then we have got Charles embeddings picking up on are threats on the farm from last year where we've got Alice deep Undercover.	1.0
And they're trying to find out because she's missed some of her country check-ins right Alice were worried about you and I honestly think that she's not. Okay. I think that definitely something's going on. I mean Edgar really took to her and wanted to make her his wife well and he did and I don't know I feel like he has a special place for her.	1.0
Yeah. I mean certainly he seem to be and she did a great job of selling it last season for sure because even until At the end when she told us like no. No, I'm really in on this and I guess stick around to get a penny out of here, too. Yeah, I go. All right. Well, I guess that justifies your crazy decisions. You are making all this past season. Okay, I'll buy that so I'm glad that she's doing this but then I'll ask you first. What do you think of Charles? Do you think he's he's like, he seems too good to be true. Do you think he is, you know?	1.0
Yes, I just get a weird vibe from him. I don't know. What about you? What do you think?	0.0
You know, it would be I would love to have somebody like a family member whether it's you know, like a cousin a brother or sister or something coming to the show and not have a hidden agenda. Not turn out to be like a secret creep. It would be nice and so far would be nice Charles is giving me the illusion that everything impression. I should say that he's above board.	1.0
Mole that he he he has been reacting to everything. I feel like in a very normal way, but I don't know like wait. Why did he come? Like, where did he come from? I'm just curious.	1.0
Yeah, it was like the one scenes. I feel like we haven't really had much yet as I'd like to see more FP and Charles scenes if we're not going to have Alice around she's gonna be hidden. I'd love to see an FP in Charleston just to see how that Dynamic is.	1.0
Oh, I would like to see that too.	1.0
Yeah, you're my kid that I didn't even know about Mmm, I still think that's it seems weird that we've got a kid that is both a half-brother to book Betty and Jughead. Yep.	1.0
Yeah, it's just like a weird like bet he's really the only one who's talking to him. Yeah. No one else is really like conversing withdrawals.	0.0
So come on. He's a good guy. He's hiding out in this basement for some over motor reason right where it is. Nice. You know, it's normal. He's got his suit on and everything. Okay, keeping track of well, whatever the farm actions happening.	1.0
Yeah, but I also feel like I don't know. Is he being a don't know if he's very trust he's not very trusting of everyone except for Betty Wright with the whole Kevin thing. You know, he was like, why did you say anything?	0.0
Like what we can't trust anyone else dive at you, but you mentioned Kevin why don't we talk about him for a hot second because we saw him as Iceland. I lamented last episode. We just see him standing outside with Josie as Archie pulls up. I'll bring His father home and that was it. No words. Nothing said just with his arm around Josie and there we go. Now we get to find out what happened over the summer that pretty much nobody spoke to him. Hmm. I the only one that would even say hello back to him would be Fang and that was through text and so he is claiming that yeah, he's worked on himself. He realizes he doesn't need the farm but he does need his friend. So he's trying to mend fences with Betty, but he still seems untrustworthy.	0.0
Yes, you know, I think I think I want to agree with Betty during this and just say that he's honestly probably just lonely and Confused from what I'm seeing. I think he's very trustworthy but he just doesn't know maybe who is his true friend. Like he said he got dropped from the farm. He felt very lost. But he lost his friends because he joined the farm. So he just needs to really be with his friends and really gain there. Trust back I think and we have a lot of people in the chat. Yes who are agreeing and they're saying that Kevin is we got a rune who Cote? I'm sorry if I butchered your name, but he says who's trust who trust Kevin is true to Betty and helps her or is he trying to get back in? What do you think think he's helping her? Maybe? He's just trying to get back in some sort of a friendship grazed or he's just lonely.	1.0
I would you know again, I would love to give pennant Kevin the benefit of the doubt because certainly I would think that he would realize he was abandoned by everybody around the farm. Plus he found out where everything that the farm was up to amass enough to make you reconsider your actions. Like why was I supporting this guy that was going to carve out my body parts to sell to somebody else and then I just abandon everything and just took off in the middle of the night deliberately leaving me behind. Yeah, especially because he Frank says you were Left behind because they didn't think you could be trusted and yet there was no that Kevin did at the end of last season that even gave you the slightest impression.	1.0
He was in deep into the farm very and deep he would have gave an organ.	1.0
Yes. If you just asked him probably he's ready to go at me. Like Betty said you dragged me by my feet to go get a lobotomy. Yeah, so, you know, it's like I don't know how anybody get the impression that we couldn't trust you.	1.0
I mean, maybe maybe they did see that sliver where he is. Just very loyal to Betty. You know, I was they've been best friends for a long time.	1.0
Yeah, that's you know what the other thing those two is. I feel like this show does not do Kevin enough justice as I've talked about last week two words, like the you say they've been best friends and that's what the show says and we rarely see them having more than like a scene or two together. And then it's you know, then we go several episodes and then reconnect for a hot second and several more episodes. We never really see them hang out just but there's never a Betty kept storyline there hasn't been an	0.0
I'm probably like a season or two. Yeah, I agree. They've been very separated more just like surface-level friends because maybe they happen friends for so long.	1.0
I'm sure I mean again it goes back to it's all about the core four and then everybody else is just at the whims of whatever the story dictates. I guess we could use Kevin for a scene here. Ok, let's write Kevin and see him but we're not going to do anything else with that character until we need them again. Like it's a little frustrating for moments like this because it's I could go either way with at least the amount of screen time that you've given me on Riverdale of Kevin. I could go either way to whether he's being truthful it better or not. Mmm.	0.0
So Logan night says it was probably something that happened during the summer with Kevin and the farm.	1.0
I don't know. I mean, yeah, it seemed wonderfully definitely something did happen.	1.0
Well not they're not friends no more.	0.0
We we do see though that Fang shows up good boy Fang and he's brainwashed. Yeah, he's he's definitely a nice. Yeah, he's in he's in deep, but we in the episode with with Kevin and Betty and Charles where Kevin does say that he'll tell them. But given the fake information and find out where the farm is located. It looks like they're located at some Hotel on the other side of the maple Barons right there. Hold up of the bunch of arms and they're ready to make a stand. Yeah, so I guess I'm gonna have to go by what Kevin saying especially what we saw in a previous next week, right?	1.0
Yes.	1.0
Okay, we believe you for now Kevin, we're still suspicious then but you know, what, you don't want are suspicious of though. We are never suspicious of our fantastic fans.	1.0
We are never suspicious Frank. Oh my God, I loved that dude. So hey guys before we move on to our next topic.

So we've also got our boy Jughead check it for site there where he's being kind of wooed recruited by a stone wall prep. Hmm. We're we got mister. Cheating's played by Sam Witwer. Yeah, if you're a big fan of Smallville, he was on there or if you big fan of the Clone Wars, he was the voice of Darth Maul on the show that show but now play mr. Kidding.	1.0
I'm excited on it.	1.0
I think Jughead needs to go, you know, it needs to go but I felt like the the show really laid it on heavy-handed that like, yeah. This is the Stonewall prep is a bunch of bunch of tools. Go to Stonewall prep. Mmm one way Mister. Ding says hey just come over for a tour and hook them up with Brett man. Could you not think of like a worse person to set you up with for a tour?	0.0
It was named Brett.	1.0
I mean it-it's just he was so obnoxious. Like how is that going to sell me? I'm going to your school having to talk to this really obnoxious guy, right?	0.0
I mean, they're just giving you a feel for the school. I guess. That's all the amenities.	1.0
Yes, really? I mean certainly I mean I was on a talk about like how amazing that you know all the stats for the school. How incredible it is it all but I'll but also the teachers write a touch except for mr. Shitting. He gets it and that just because he's right coming up right behind me. Yeah, but I thought Brett was the worst tour guide that you could have to get somebody to go like yeah, this thing's cool. Yeah, I'll go to the school.	0.0
Especially Jughead who doesn't really, you know Vibe with those kinds of personalities, you know, he's more of a loner Saudi had to put someone like Brett with him is little shocking.	0.0
So he does go to a salon the following day where they get her. Talk about Moby Dick.	1.0
I've never Read Moby Dick, you know, I was supposed to don't tell my ninth-grade literary T-shirt.	0.0
Oh, I am sure you're watching that great literary teacher. She definitely is. Oh busted. Yeah. I never read it. I've never seen any. Any of the films like with Gregory Peck, I've never read The Cliff Notes here and tell you like call me Ishmael. That's the only thing that I got a whale right? Yeah, that's right, but they do this lawn and Judkins able to drop a little knowledge there which seems to like shut up the rest of the people in the class head like Brett. It's just sitting like I want to like tell him he's wrong but I mean he quoted he quoted him. All right? No, I totally	0.0
we agree. Yeah, I brought with his face was like like yeah want to say something to you, but I know that it's not going to be right.	1.0
So yeah, so it's like and Jughead loves it because I well he loves it because he tells everybody back at Riverdale High. It's like yeah to hang out with people that are actually Read Moby Dick, but I'm also thinking like well so far out of that Salon we never really saw much of anything with some people griping about having to read it and then we saw Brett being frustrated because Jagged butter pie. Point right really hear anything else from any other student made me think like yeah, these guys are it was really in-depth discussion about Moby Dick right?	1.0
There was no discussion. There was just Jugheads comment.	0.0
I've been at all like quieter down after that and then we left he left the scene, but just to make sure that make jacket sediments like not want to do this FPS like yeah, you should go to do this and then it comes down to a class where everybody's in and the teacher comes out with a summer reading. And I don't know. I've never had a teacher in high school. Give me summer reading.	0.0
No, I know that, you know extra credit but never mandatory so she decides to read and it's really dull Glacier Pace.	0.0
Yes, and then Betty doesn't matter which I know I would never have the guts to do is to walk out in the middle of the class while the teacher standing up there reading it's senior year baby.	0.0
Like what do you want from that?	0.0
Well, they just walk a come with me. We're gonna walk out right now the fact that she's doesn't say anything. She just keeps reading and let's say go like what kind of cheese is cheese checked out. I know we both looked at each other like oh, wow. I mean, it's Day 2 Day 3 and already checked out late the first day left class the second day. So by the end of the episode that he decides he's going to go to Stonewall good.	0.0
Yes. Yeah. I can't wait to see what all these crazies do over there.	1.0

Also, make sure you follow us. You never miss an episode of AfterBuzz TV now speaking of crazy though. We don't have to go all the way to Stonewall prep to find crazies. Sometimes it's as close as one of our best friends and their father because we do get to see Reggie. We saw a little bit of a last season when he showed up by talking to them after they brought up the the gold Griffin and gargoyles game. He showed up talking about the other Shiner that we had from his dad. This time he's got another one and we get to see Reggie being belittled by is that a football practice?	1.0
Yeah that came out a little left field. Gotta say I did not think that that storyline would happen. I was wondering where he had the black guy last episode. I'm honestly excited though that they're also bringing more light to Reggie's life because we only ever knew him as Veronica's like boy toy basically, so it's good to see that there's a	1.0
actually some you know dense stuff behind him and it's very sad though to see abuse though, you know it is but then this feel like him turn my head or special segment here for a moment boy. It's okay, but it also brings it back to my frustration at times of this show where we get to see Reggie Evans kind of Ferris Bueller moment or I like Cameron. I'm sorry, he's camera moment from Ferris Bueller work takes it out on his dad's car because they never pay them any attention. Right and that's how he's going to show them and so Reggie doesn't same thing with the baseball bat to his dad's prized car and then we just cut to later where it's are cheating with Richie. Well, you know it started as talking like I think I rather would have seen that scene.	0.0
Yeah, I honestly didn't I wanted to talk about this too and then that segment but I honestly I feel like that's a lie. Like I don't just from what we've seen and how he said his dad never talked to him before all of a sudden you smash his car window and he's ready to open up to you and talk to you and listen to you. It just I don't know. It seems a little far-fetched to me. I don't know if maybe he was just deflecting and didn't want to talk about it or if it really is true.	0.0
I'm I mean you hope for Reggie that it is true. But I mean, we'll probably never going to see his dad again. So we'll just to take his word for it. So sure Dad Mark game in one episode and speaking of dads. We do have wrapping up our core for storylines. We do have Veronica dealing with Paparazzi. Yes, as well as Hiram kind of saying hey, you know what it was Veronica. She was the one that did it and I took the fall for everything that she did very ballsy and he's now giving up his mija like what's going on?	0.0
On I thought like I know like large family over everything besides maybe Hermione, but that's his daughter and I'm a little shocked that I'm like 90% shock 10% not shocked because it's like mr. Lodge, but I didn't think he would maybe stoop that low to throw his daughter under the bus again.	1.0
Yeah, I'm not surprised anything that I room does at this point, but we end the episode because Kind of figure out what's gonna be the hook for this season and we've got see see some tantalizing things Cheryl. Mr. Honey. What's going to happen with Reggie news Ted that certainly tantalizing hook, you know, Alice and the farm and Charles and Betty, but it ends up being at least the flash for we get at the end of the episode is to spring break and we see everybody's searching for Jughead after he says I'm going to Stonewall it's gonna be great.	1.0
Oh my God, that just gave me flashbacks to when he got beat up so bad that he almost died in a bush. That's not funny. But it is I don't know. I'm getting like flashbacks. I'm like, is he gonna be really dead this time?	0.0
Like, I don't know. I mean I saw that I mean at the end of last season they burned his beanie look prep boys.	0.0
Don't mess around. They're rich and their parents can cover stuff up. So	0.0
Well after my brain went, you know, I feel like it's time for us to do the hottest new special segment. Yes, Riverdale Riverdale rants guys, but I can so yeah.	1.0
Remember Duran's guys where we talk about one thing from the episode that really grinded our gears and we just really need to Hash it out. Out right here for you guys. You have one I did we did sort of touch on it, but it was Reggie and his storyline. Well bringing his father in I feel like I should be more sensitive about this, but honestly, I'm just like, where is this coming from? It's very left field. And again, like is this just going to go away and then we don't see Mark for like eight episodes and he randomly comes back in.	0.0
Yeah. It's The frustrating thing about the show my I am torn between two rants, but I guess I'll go with my second one and that is having to do with Veronica because you at the end of the her story arc for this episode. She goes art. I'm finally going to make a stand the paparazzi are right outside her door when how they even got into Riverdale High terrible, especially for a new team new principal that's all about order and discipline and they came from all different angles. It's already mr. Honey, you've failed but they show up at veronika's home and she slams The Door in the compose herself for a moment and then opens it up and says, you know, I'm only going to give one statement and it's going to be the beginning and end of anything I have to say, but I'll only do it at Le Bon Nuit Speakeasy and there will be a special performance after they will have a press conference after my performance. So we have these poor journalist, but I can't I mean I can't say poor journalist because there's the other just invading a high school, you know senior year high school students life to get whatever salacious Coop they are. They're dirty. They're Sleazy and there's coming. Okay sure, but they also that it's so self-indulgent a Veronica to say you come and watch me saying all that jazz and then I'll tell you what you need to hear. Look she's a business lady.	0.0
She got her suffer audience and maybe she made a little bit of Revenue while they were there.	0.0
Oh, I was like, come on. Yeah, that was a little like wow why so So awful so awful so awful. I mean hot second mini 10-second Riverdale rant was also when we see they set up Kevin to go find Fang to give them, you know to lure him out. So Kevin kind of came this false information, but nobody's there except for Betty. Why isn't the FBI than just following Fang so they can find it until it takes all the rest of the episode for Fang to get release that information.	0.0
Well, you see this is why I have my suspicions about Charles. What the heck is Charles doing in the basement? Is he really? With the FBI, this is badge. Fake Betty. Did you do your research on him?	0.0
Those are hot Riverdale rants. So if you've got a rant turmoil in the chat or leave a comment down below. We'd love to hear what what made you want to rant this? Yes as we're getting wrap up though. I you know, I guess I we can I do a little bit of predictions everyday almost ran out, so Stevie predictions So many things have been set up this this episode for the season. What is what is something that you feel you're going to be seeing?	1.0
I'm very excited for the Stonewall prep people. I want to get to know them. I want to get to see all these crazies over there. I want to know the dynamic that that are going to happen with Jughead while he's there. I don't know. I'm ready for those prep boys, but girls I want to see what's going on over there and That bread yo Brett's not too hard to look at those. He cannot be all Moody all he wants but he looks good while doing it. Also, I really feel like Alice isn't danger. I feel like she's being held hostage. And that maybe Edgar found out about her little deal with the FBI.	1.0
All right. All right. Yeah me boy. I won't it doesn't seem like it's a hard prediction to make that night. Everything is not on the up and up with mr. Chitting. I'm sure there's going to be something every sort of kind of Mentor figure almost invariably ends up having some kind of dark secret about them that's going to drag Jughead down and it's going to lead into this whole big thing that happened somehow in spring break. Where'd you get ends up missing damn you. Mr. Trump calling it now damn you folks that's gonna do it for this episode of the river to laughter show time flies when you break it down a fun show like this.	1.0

This is a pack a day podcast Hello everybody.	1.0
Welcome to another episode of the packet a podcast your One Stop Shop for all news and Analysis from the green and gold. My name is Mike went along with me Tyler grigorik as always as we turn the corner from free agency. Now toward the draft. April is just about a week away are about one month away from the NFL draft course. That's where the Packers make most. Most of their bread and butter and Tyler you've been doing a lot of work with the draft coming up not just with the cheesehead draft guide but also with your Packer threshold and everything you've worked with so I guess tell us all what you've been working on as far as the draft goes over the past few months.	1.0
I mean if you can think of anything draft related, I've probably been working on it. I've got my own personal big board that I've been kind of putting together that I'm hoping to release probably the top 100. I am going to be nowhere near the level that the guys should like the draft. Gar, as far as how in-depth into the prospects I get I'm not able to watch 300 guys. I just don't have the time for that. However, I'm hoping to release the top 100 which would be a first for me. Hopefully working towards maybe a top 200 next year. So but that's kind of hot right now and also the Packers thresholds as one of my I think my proudest little accomplishments that I put together. It's just, you know, I can think Justice mosquito for putting together the hard data and then Then I just kind of put it all together each year and last year. It was relatively predictive. So I decided to do it again this year, even though you know, it's only good to come second year. He pretty much kept to the thresholds that were established under Ron wolf and that and then under Ted Thompson so we can get a little bit more into that, but I'm pretty excited for our show today.	1.0
No, I agree. I'm really excited draft is always been kind of my thing as well. I've watched it every year really going back to when I Javon Walker was drafted. I've watched almost every round every year since then so it's been a long time of watching the draft on and on this guy's case and and in recent years I've gone with you guys a little bit with the threshold and what focusing on the relative Athletic score and doing a little more mocking and just reading up lil bit more and kind of paying more attention to people who aren't named Mel. But we look at this year specifically there is a lot going on for what the Packers could do their work in free agency over the past week bringing in a miss the Smith and Billy Turner have really made things a little less clear as to what they're going to do in the draft. They don't have to go get an edge right away. They don't have to go get alignment right away tight end to you probably should but if there's there's still options out there for what Brian go to comes can do and this is the perfect draft class for him to make moves and move around and get the guy. He wants no matter what position it might be a couple.	1.0
We agree and I'm so excited for this draft because I don't foresee any more big move from the Packers prior to the draft. I just don't think they have the ammo that they're willing to part with and then also the financial flexibility is a little bit less now that they've kind of, you know revamp the defense through free agency, which is honestly is all going according to my perfect plan for the Packers offseason. And that was to supplement the defense with veteran free agents and then go into the draft and address the off. That's with depth offensive pieces. So I'm very excited for good cuz he can do anything he wants to do, you know, he's going to have to work with patent and the floor to make these decisions and get get this team back to their Championship status.	1.0
No, I no doubt about that. And so we'll go back into the thresholds Park pinned on your Twitter at Tyler underscore dress everyone. Go check that out. He has a Google document with the Packers threshold along with draft prospects and whether they made them whether they visited with the team with their combine measurements were and what they can possibly bring to this team. So take a look at that. So Tyler I'll let you just kind of run with it. What are these thresholds at? The Packers are looking at?	1.0
Yeah, so as I mentioned before it's it's truly truly the heart. Work has been done by Justice Mesquita. I kind of just piggybacked off of him and but basically a couple years ago, he did a thorough study and evaluated the prospects that Green Bay tends to draft and the guys that they tend to drift towards when they're making their selections and I can honestly tell you they draft athletes for the most part. It's every single one of the positions has a couple thresholds, but they're pretty much all inclusive of basically speed agility and size depending on the position, but pretty much this is Speed and Agility. That's really all they're looking for. They don't care about strength. They don't care about a lot of other characteristics. I think quarterback offensive line and defensive back are and wide receiver. Those are the ones where they care about size for defensive line and Edge. There's this couple special calculations called. Oh my goodness. They're the basically their agility and speed calculations. The exact name of the calculations escaping me. It's not like a super well-known one. But if you ever want to know just reach out to me and I'll do a little bit of digging and I have it in my notes the gentleman who originated the formula, but basically there's a formula that calculates agility and speed using their three-cone time 40-yard dash their height and their weight and their certain threats certain thresholds that have been met in the past and certain thresholds that were looking for moving forward, especially with the Packers needing Edge help. Till I would say that they still need Edge help, you know, it's a good tool to look at and it's been a pretty good indicator and I know Justice Mesquita, he knows its edges, you know, he puts out those Force players every year. So they're pretty root pretty good indicators of relative success in the so I'm very excited to just keep updating it and updating it weekly currently with pro day numbers as new players who didn't test that the combine or players just who are improving on there. Numbers in general I'm pretty excited for what it's become and what it's growing into and definitely going to keep continuing this every year as long as the thresholds are going to hold true. Which last year. I think it was like seven seven of the players seven of the draft picks last year fell Within These thresholds, so I'm pretty excited for how predictive it was last year and what it might indicate this year.	1.0
No doubt, and the thresholds do matter but also know thing that matters and apparently Brian could conceive the same way is the res a relative Athletics for only one draft pick did not meet the elite threshold for that last year. That was cool Madison. We look at guys like Kendall diners and Mark was veiled is scamming Equity me saying Brown if they were Elite athletes, they were some of the best of the best at their pro day at their combine whatever and I think that does play a part with how he's guys read the the team drafts whether it is because of the pure athleticism that Baby, he reads the math bomb Twitter or he just has it own stuff that he goes on the pet. The Packers have an act like you said to draft spectacular athletes. And another good example is Oren Burks. He tested through the roof and jumped into the third round conversation could be starting at inside linebacker this year. So the RAS also plays a big part and I guess what did you see from that as far as how that factors in?	1.0
Yeah, and if you guys have the time Ross juggling did a fantastic study put together a Packers big bored and he did it pretty much based off the RS for the most part. It's a great read go check it out. And then she said TV, but essentially the relative athletic scores just me. They are comparing athletes for the last 30 or so years. There's a specific year that this dates back to kentley Plaid on Twitter at math bomb to the fantastic fantastic job of putting all this data together and he does it I believe for free. I don't think he gets any money for it, but it's basically a formula that he's arrived and a model and he just puts these numbers out. And what it does is it Compares Compares players relative to other players of their position using their size the height their weight, they're all their testing scores and just kind of puts out what percentile athlete they are in comparison to the rest of the players that were at that position for the last x amount of years. So every single year, it gets more it gets stronger and better indicator of what type of athlete that you're dealing with. With and it's just it's such a great tool and and we're blessed to live in the 21st century.	1.0
No, that's a good way to put a we are very lucky to be in the time of laser timing and the internet and everything that happens like that. It makes things so much more exact when you see all these testing numbers and you look at a good example would be at the combine. You look at Andy, Isabella. He his 40 time was originally unofficial for five or so, and everyone was freaking out and be disappointed then they realized that the system was off but then when they corrected it and it being a 4-3, so it kind of shows the difference of how that works in tech technology, but Just before we go into our preliminary kind of fun for around Mach. They were going to go through and just a couple minutes. What's going to be what do you think is the biggest Prospect for your who is the biggest Prospect for you that you think meets all the thresholds that you really want to see it either 12 or 30, you know, and honestly, there's a number of guys that I would love to have it either position.	1.0
That's the beauty of this year's draft. However, I do think the Packers are actually pretty much enamored with one specific. Pacific player much like gudykunst says he was last year with Jai you are Alexander. I think that guy could be Noah Fant this year and I think 12 might be just a bit Rich for Noah Fant. If we're being quite honest, I would like to see him taken in the late teens early 20s, if possible. I think that that kind of meets the place where we could see a run on tight ends based off some of the other teams needs and value fits and stuff like that. No offense would be a dynamic player and a dynamic I did. Into this Packers offense and not to take away from TJ Hawkinson, but I think no offense. It's just Far and Away a better athlete even though the relative at the relative Athletic score would indicate. Otherwise, I just think that fan is going to provide more dynamic system from the tight end position than Hawkinson will I think fans are very capable blocker not as not as bad as he's given credit for he definitely has some work to do in the area, but I think he could be a very serviceable blocker moving forward and I think that given that that quality and that characteristic I think that he's going to be heads above TJ Hawkinson career-wise.	1.0
And I agree and that's kind of the thing. I've been kind of working on for weeks. And you look at the to Iowa tight ends. I said, no laughs and is Jordan Reed 2.0 T. Jay Hawkins kind of Chris Cooley or me is ceiling would be like a Jason winner Greg Olsen, but I think Fant your said is much more Dynamic his Arias of nine point eight nine. His combine was absolutely incredible and he was a pretty good player for a long time and I will Hawkins to really broke out last year, but fantas been doing it for two three years now and Kirk Ferentz players tend to do pretty well in the end. Whether it's George Kettle, we've seen Now setting records or Scott Shannon had a nice long career in the NFL as well. So Iowa tight ends tend to do pretty well in the NFL and I think there's a solid chance as well that one of them will be in Green Bay for me personally. I am actually in Amber with Brian Burns and all those concerns about his frame and everything, but the Packers need that edge Turner we look at the Smiths. They're very very good players, but having a guy with the speed and build of a Brian Burns gives it that extra dynamic. Thing where you could have all three of them on the field and really cause problems with that as well. But like you said there are so many guys in play at 12 and maybe even trading down into the late teens to get fans or treating up from 30 to get fan because I would be surprised if they take 10 players with with the capitulate is and with with the chance to really get some special players. I think they might trade up a couple of times on maybe they won or at the very least day to as well. Well, I think said to do you think you want to maybe hop into a little bit of a mock draft here before for us?	1.0
Yes. We should I'm so excited. Let's do that actually.	1.0
Alright, so we are on the draft network. Of course, you can listen to yesterday's podcast with Joel Marino from the draft Network and we're going to use their predictive board go through four rounds and will be manually picking each Packer pick at 12:30 and the to for second and third as well. So as things go along I am solely scrolling through right now. And the big thing right now is Kyla Marie didn't go number one. and so with our pick We do have Brian Burns out there. Both Iowa tight ends out there DK Metcalf is the currently the highest rated player out there for this one as long with along with Devin Bush.	1.0
So tell who went one through eleven. Let's let's do a brief. Let's do a brief like one through eleven. See who went there.	1.0
All right, if let's do that Nick bow. So it number one to the Arizona Cardinals Josh Allen to the 49ers Quinton Williams joins Leonard Williams on the Jets Devon white, too. The Raiders ratio on Gary goes to Tampa Bay Kayla Marie the newest Giants backup quarterback. We'll see if that goes well John Taylor to Jacksonville Montez sweat is on his way to Detroit and Oliver is in Buffalo Dwayne Haskins will be Joe Flacco's back up in Denver and Andre Dillard the tackle from Washington State goes to Cincinnati with 11 according to this simulation. So Tyler Alice Q if you had to pick which player would you want to take at 12?	1.0
Well it to me, it sounds I didn't hear John William. So I think that strong consideration has to be given to Jonah Williams. Now my consideration there with Williams is that I know that there's not a lot of concerns with him being able to move to the right side, but I think he's best suited as a left tackle. Now a lot of those skills are translatable. However, that doesn't mean every single player can go from one side to the other and Not entirely sure, you know that they want to try and do that. It kind of depends. I I think if they take if they take Williams, I think that that's a that's a luxury pick for them at that point. But how about you go through maybe the top ten that draft network has there that at 12 basically?	1.0
Okay, their Top 10 Prospects available right now rdk Medcalf the straight line receiver from Ole Miss Drew lock quarterback from Missouri. Brian Burns The Edge from Florida State's. Both Iowa tight ends Fant and Hawkinson back-to-back. Devon Bush middle linebacker from Michigan Josh Jacobs running back from Alabama Christian Wilkins from Clemson Cody Ford Guard from Oklahoma and then Jonah Williams and then greedy Williams right behind them. So there's your top prospects on the board right now according the simulation in round. One and I like the idea of Jonah Williams. I do Wonder like you said it might be a luxury you kind of want a guy who's going to come in right away and play a little bit more do use your top one at 12. But I'd be I'd be leaning toward Devon Bush personally myself get that another Dynamic linebacker to play with Blake Martinez go sideline to sideline and can and he's shown he can be a truly Dynamic player.	1.0
I honestly think that this is a this type of situation that we're going through right now is ideal. Feel for a trade down Drew lock is sitting there with some team licking their chops trying to get ahead of the of the Washington Redskins. I honestly think that they could they could get a pretty good haul if they traded out of this position you trade down a few spots, maybe four or five and you're still getting Jonah Williams Noah fan TJ Hawkinson greedy Williams, even who I would be completely okay with Green Bay spending a first-round pick, even though they spent so much draft capital on the position. You know, I you can never have too many corners, especially In and defense, excuse me, like like Mike patents. However, it's obviously a luxury to spend on a corner. I think at this point, I'm not ready to spend a top-15 pick on Devon Bush. That's my honest feeling about that. I think I think Brian Burns would be the selection for me here if if we had to take a selection at 12.	1.0
No, I agree with you. And so let's go with it. Brian Burns who again is my draft Crush. So I trust you with Brian Burns again long athletic. He was a productive player at Florida State and he all he does is make plays he can really get after the quarterback. And as we as we've seen from tape with the Chiefs and what Mike Smith likes to do with the outside linebackers, he will get that football. He will get a lot of strip sacks and that is built exactly for what the Packers can do. So as we move to pick 30, so kind of recapping what happened. After Brian Burns was taken by Green Bay and 12 Drew lock goes to Miami at 13 Christian Wilkins to the Falcons DK Medcalf to Washington Jonah Williams to the Panthers replace Matt Khalil a Cleveland Pharrell to the Giants Dalton Reisner to the Vikings. That's gonna hurt Ross Cody Ford to the Titans Devin Bush to the Steelers greedy Williams to Seattle. That's a really good fit there Camille Harry your Arizona State boy to Baltimore Garrett Bradbury to Didn't Josh Jacobs to the Raiders Chauncey Gardiner Johnson the safety from Florida to the Eagles Hakeem Butler to the Colts TJ Hawkinson goes to the Raiders at 27 Byron Murphy cornerback from Washington to the LA Chargers and Mack Wilson from Alabama to the Chiefs. There's a normal name that I didn't just read and I think we're going to take him a 13. That's probably no offense.	1.0
Yeah, you're right. We're starting to give the territory where you get to groupthink with these pics, but A reason why the no offense selection specifically to Green Bay is such a popular one. He fits indeed. It's a good fit for the offense on top of that just like every other player. We're going to pick today. He fits what Green Bay is looking for at the position. He meets their thresholds easily. So I think that Noah fan is an easy selection here, but I'm curious who else is on the board. I may be you said it I just missed it, but I didn't hear Drew lock either.	1.0
Jewel Ocwen the pick after Brian Burns. He went to Miami got it. So the quarterbacks really kind of check out. So I'll do the top top seven prospects that are not right now. No elephant is the top of the board DeAndre Baker from Georgia is to a corner AJ Brown is third from Mississippi Nasir Adderley is fourth safety from Delaware and the Packer Legacy. Jerry Tillery is V from Notre Dame Eric McCoy from Texas AM Jonathan. Abram is number 7 from Mississippi State and though that's your top seven currently. Peggy's I think fans. It just makes too much sense if he is there a 30 to make the pic he couldn't he's the souped-up version of what your Michael Finley was and I think he'd be a stone-cold solid player for years and years and years and Green Bay Pleasant, you get the fifth year option for a tight end, which is always a good thing.	1.0
You know, I have a guy like Chauncey Gardiner Johnson Falls to this spot. I think I'm running to the podium and taking him as well and I pass on fact that I grew because of the value of the position. I think you can get herb Smith I think can get More production out of him probably not as dynamic as no offense, but I think you can get similar production out of Earth Smith, even though we tested poorly and he actually tested himself out of Packer thresholds. However, a guy like nice and icy rattly as well. I'm contemplating that pic here. I think he's the only guy out of that group that you just read through that I'm even thinking about it 30 with with no offense. So on the board, but I think there are some other safety options in the second and third round where we can Ford to pass on Adderley right now	1.0
Okay, so let's make the pick will go with Noah Fant from the University of Iowa at 30. So as I go down Diandra Baker to the Rams AJ Brown to the Patriots, of course that happens at Elite of the Colts shikai polite to the Raiders Earth Smith to the Jaguars at 38 for nodal there. Jeffrey Simmons to the Broncos goes to their packers back on the board just in Lane was last one taken for the Detroit Lions Packers back up at pick number 44 other get names that came. Off the board where Jerry Tillery Jonathan Abram Greg Little a money or a Warrior from Penn State. Yeah, I need because you see from West Virginia. Like it's a Jeffrey Simmons Crane Creek Lindstrom from Boston College. So Packers back up and around to pick 44 top names on the board Eric McCoy Le Insight interior lineman from Texas A&M is the top of the board Hollywood Browns there at the from Oklahoma the receiver Kelvin Harmon from NC State Daniel Jones quarterback from do. Duke Dexter Lawrence the massive lemon from Clemson Debo Samuel South Carolina receiver Paris Campbell, Ohio State receiver, then a couple of safeties Deonte Thompson and Taylor rep are the top of the board right now one Thornhill not too far behind them either as well. So Tyler, I'll turn to you year representing the coaching staff with all the film work. You've done. What play would you like to see at 44 for Green Bay of the names that are out there, you know, I look at a guy like Deonte Thompson.	1.0
One thornhill's the guy that I've really been toting on social media. He's a guy that fits all of their athletic thresholds. I think he's a very under-the-radar player this year. He's gonna be a good pick. What for whoever takes him in the second round. I don't think he goes any higher than the second. You know, I wish that a guy like Garrett Bradbury. I haven't heard his name, but I'm assuming he's gone by this point. So Garrett Bradbury would be fantastic selection at 30 or 40 for same thing with The other Center I can't members name. I'm blanking on the guy. However, Chris Lynch from he's not Center in Turkey alignment. Sorry Crystal incident from Boston College both.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
So yeah, so if either one of them photo 44, I think that that's a great fit as well. I'm not a big fan of McCoy here. I just think that it's not necessarily what I'm looking for. He's a good player. I just not I'm not running to the podium for him personally, but I think Really considering guys like Deonte Thompson lawn Thornhill all three receivers that you mentioned Hollywood Brown Depot Samuel and the other one there with wires Campbell yet. No. No the good news Calvin Harmon.	0.0
Yes, that one.	1.0
I think those are the five names that you're really looking at here.	1.0
Yeah. No, I agree with you. I think I'd also put a little bit of thought into Taylor rap because just because he reminds me a lot of like a Mike a high type player. He's a smart safety who would really help stabilize things of the a dreamless back there, but I personally think that I think one for who was shooting a really Limited in coverage.	1.0
No, I agree. He's just really Limited in the coverage and it's one of those things where Taylor rap is a player where you're taking a high floor with a not much higher. Doing so it kind of depends on what you're looking for. Yeah, you're right. He would kind of solidify the position and he wouldn't be bad but he wouldn't be amazing. It would just be solid and I guess that's worth something but that's not what I'm looking for here. This offense needs Playmakers specifically, I would love Deonte Thompson here. I think that that's a good pick I wouldn't be upset at they took Deonte Thompson 44. I think it's great value specifically considering what he does. He's got legitimate concerns about some of the facts facets of his game one Thornhill. Would be a fantastic selection here as well. He's also got legitimate concerns, but I think that he's going to be a solid selection, but I'm looking at Marquis Brown. I know that I know that he does not fit their traditional receiver, but I do think that that could change a little bit this year with Matt LaFleur the home it's tough to get on board with Marquis Brown because of the lisfranc injury and just how small he is but Man, when you turn on the tape, he is electric and it's just so much fun to watch and to think about what he would provide this not only does offense, but the Special Teams unit Depot Samuel is a close second in that department. He didn't he could just do so many different things and Kelvin Harmon is just solid, you know, you're getting a good receiver of Kelvin Harmon. So I'm good with any any of those five.	1.0
Do you have any input there it to me when it comes to the safeties. It depends on what you want with them. Do you want the kind of steady solid all-around player? Beyonce Thompson who who's in who's just kind of good player, but he's more around it or do you want the ball skills of Thornhill former Corner who is really really strong and coverage and he's a guy who's going to create turnovers for you guys. That's the biggest thing for me with the receivers Hollywood Brown does worry me with an injury and he's also very very small and slight so I wonder if that could be a recurring thing Deebo Samuel would be my choice because as if I was going to go receiver because his route running is so Dynamic and I ever You came at the Senior Bowl. He was absolutely making top-flight corners of foolish out there. And and I think he's a guy who stuck drop because he didn't have the greatest year at South Carolina, but he's another solid player for so for me to be down between Samuel and Thornhill, but I'll defer to you if you want you to be one of those okay with you lean toward.	0.0
You know to appeal to the lighter side of things and to the sentimental side of things. I think I'm going to go with Depot Samuel to replace Randall Cobb because you can do a lot of the similar things that Randall Cobb could and I think Matt Le Flore is going to really appreciate a gadget player and he could play inside outside. He can be your returner in special teams. I think that it's a good selection here. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the other four that we talked. About either okay.	1.0
So I just made the pick Debo Samuel. Welcome to Green Bay. If this would work out for me getting a Friday which we will be recapping day 2 of the draft on the packet a podcasts ourselves in just about a month or so for now is picks flying off the board. Now as we are into round three just waiting on a few of the simulation to go. Well. Luckily. I have it on the fast timing so that will move fairly fairly well, And now grimby up at pick 75 names that came off since then notable names Daniel Jones went to Washington to do quarterback Hollywood Brown goes to the Panthers Chase winter, which breaks Jacobs hard everywhere. He goes to the Dolphins Dexter Lawrence to the Browns Charles omena Hue from Texas to the Vikings Kelvin Harmon to the Steelers Michael Dieter first Badger off. The board goes to Philly Caleb McGarry and Taylor at back to back to Houston Trayvon Mullen to the Patriots running back off the Cordero Henderson from Memphis to Philly Dan to the Dallas Cowboys rakia sin quarterback from Temple goes to the Indianapolis Colts David Edwards for another Badger goes to the Chargers Julian love gone to the chief Sandy Isabella to the Saints Jason Stern Burger Patriots get another cell a tight end which really hurts the inside Eric McCoy round 3 to the Cardinals Paris Campbell just went off the board Tyree Jackson Off the board to Jacksonville Blake Cashman off the board in a Rasta, whatever. And him to Tampa Bay last pick made was the Andre Walker Edge from Georgia to the Buffalo Bills. So one Thornhill still out there at 75. So the rock in the podium, I read it.	1.0
I'm gonna Mash think it let's talk about who else is available.	1.0
But yes the top the top five names out there one Thornhill from Virginia Elkton Jenkins from Mississippi State interior. Lineman. One of my other draft crushes miles Sanders running back from Penn State Darnell Savage from Maryland and Emani hooker from Iowa are the top five prospects out there. So three safeties.	1.0
Yeah, so am IA hooker himself is a it's a fantastic Prospect. He would be a little Swiss army knife another one for Mike Pettine to use. I think that the pic here has to be one Thornhill though as much as we just talked about him. He fits every single threshold of the Packers were looking for at the position and I think that he would provide a tremendous duo with a dream a journey most because they can both do a lot of different things and I'm honestly just a fan of thornhill's intellectual and instinctual abilities and that's not something you can teach in a Player No, I agree.	1.0
Yeah, if you have a trio of Thornhill Amos and then Josh Jones kind of up in the Box. I think you're in good shape. So we'll go with Juan Thornhill there and there he goes Dawson noxious went off the board Savage off the board. Am IA hooker to the Dolphins. So the Dolphins taking all of my topics Damien Harris off the board. Renault Ren from Arizona State to the Titans for you, drew Sammy off the board mile Sanders to the Texans Riley Ridley to the Lions. The hell warring a good tight end of the Cowboys JSA a white side to the Chargers. as we slowly work our way through round three max Crosby Edge from Eastern Michigan to the Jaguars is looking for notable names. This was Anthony Nelson final pick of the round to the Ravens as we're now in round 4, so we have two more picks left in this Mock. And in this podcast David Montgomery just went to the Buccaneers if this if this simulation were to hold So Packers, I'll pick one 14. Last pic was Will Harris from Boston College. So top five I'll go top 10 players. I'm getting later in the in the draft process. Number one Prospect out. There is Miles Boykin from Notre Dame wide receiver Josh Oliver from San Jose State tight end is the second top prospect. Jajuan Johnson safety from Miami Dairy is Slayton from Auburn wide receiver Connor McGovern Guard from Penn State. Antoine Wesley from Texas Tech treyvion Williams from Texas A&M a running back Jacoby Myers from NC State and Dennis daily from South Carolina and offensive tackle are the top prospects on the board according to the draft networks predictive board.	1.0
So the two the three names actually that caught my attention. We're Darius Slayton Connor McGovern and then there was another receiver in their mouths Boykin. Excuse me. So both Boykin and Slayton are guys that have Packers I can guarantee you're going to be in love with they blow the thresholds out of the water. I'm looking at the position though, and it's starting to get a little log jammed with a selection of Depot Samuel. Connor McGovern is a guy that I would be looking at in this area and this part of the draft solid solid player, you know, he's a little bit developmental but that's what you're getting in the fourth round. I think that's exactly what they're looking for in their lineman right now. Not only that he fits what they're looking fits their thresholds with the four five seven short shuttle and a 7-6 6-3 cone. Obviously, he fits the size. So I think Connor McGovern is the selection for me here Joel Marino talked about his ability to play in a Zone. Out and also has some lateral Mobility. So I think he fits with the Packers going to try and do in the Run game very well and then you can try and teach him to coach him up. I should say in the passing game. And so I think that Connor McGovern is the selection for me here.	1.0
No, I agree. I had as much as I like do the young receivers like slate and Boykin and even Wesley little bit the Packers young receivers. I want to see what they can do this year. And we've already taken Debo Samuel off the board. So I think another you offensive lines the way to go. They do need to fortify it. McGovern's he's going to be a steady player. I think he's going to be a solid player for a long time. And I think that you'd and plus drafting a pure interior offensive linemen will help because years past we've always have two tackles and shifted him in. I think drafting a guy who's been a guard before gives him a little bit of that extra Edge when they come into camp and let you learn the intricacies right away. And so yeah, let's make Connor McGovern The Pick and so just a few more pics is till we get to our gift from the Washington Redskins at pick 118 and there goes miles Boykin right off the bat. So the three picks between McGovern and the current one Justin Hollins from Oregon goes to the Panthers miles Boykin to the Dolphins again because they take everyone that we want and Joe. Jackson of Miami goes to the Falcons So now top guys on the board Josh all over still out there from San Jose State. Jajuan Johnson from Miami Darius. Slaton Antoine Wesley. Treyvion Williams, Jacoby Myers Dennis daily Marquis Blair from Utah Ronnie Anderson from Oklahoma and Demarcus Lodge from Mississippi are the top guys on the board will further down the Border guys, like will Grier Terry Godwin Titus Howard Jared Stidham still on the board a little bit further down house Gaskins still down there as well, but There's still some good names out. There is still some good prospects for pick 118.	1.0
Yeah, you know, I'm actually looking to supplement either I linebacker or defensive line here. Now this just to be quite Frank. This is not a good year for inside linebackers specifically when you start looking at the Packers thresholds now their thresholds for linebackers are actually relatively strict. There's never many prospects that meet them. So I think when they see Layers that are close to the thresholds or even meet them they're jumping all over them and there's only a handful of guys that you're probably even looking at here a guy like drue tranquill from Notre Dame. He's on that. He's on the cusp of meeting all the thresholds. A guy from Catholic. I like Cameron Smith from USC. Bobbio correctly from Stanford, but I didn't hear you. Say Caitlyn Saunders. Is he still available the defensive lineman from Western, Illinois?	1.0
Let's see interior defense Supply and Kaylin Saunders. I do not see him. Let me go through quickly through the draft. I didn't go through every name. So let me deal with check really quick. Kalin Saunders went off the board to the Indianapolis Colts at pick 89 at pick 89.	0.0
Okay, so that would be a guy I'd be looking at here.	1.0
He's gonna so I can do very quickly because hop interior lineman out there right now defensive line. Daniel Wise of Kansas is the top one the David Mack and Kingsley Kiki are the top lineman and top. It'll middle linebackers are David long Tavon, Kony and Gary Johnson. For the inside linebackers.	1.0
Yeah, so I think honestly here I'm looking. This is possibly where we might see a running back come off the board. I think we're going to see the Packers pursue a past catching running back a passing specialist running back. There's a couple of them in this year's draft one of the James Williams from Washington State. He might be around five pick. He doesn't meet any of the thresholds necessarily he kind of is just below all of them. I think Miles Sanders is like the only one that meets them. All right now. Tony Pollard from Memphis is a guy who's kind of rising updraft boards as well. So this is where it really starts to get interesting with the Packers decide to do where they did where they decide to add depth, but I think what I'm doing here personally is I'm looking at a guy like dalen mac. So a guy like dalen mac. He's he meets the thresholds for the most part. He's a little little less agile than you'd want him to but he's a true nose tackle. He would take some of the duties off of Kenny Clarke the Packers have already met. With him, once which kind of says a lot to me, they're not meeting with a lot of players at this point, which is very surprising to me as considering the amount of visits at the rest of the teams in the league of had but the Packers have not met with a lot of players. So I feel like they're kind of they've already got their guys that they're kind of like targeting in on day lamech is a guy they've already met with I believe that was back at the Senior Bowl and he's a guy who pretty much meets what they're looking for. He's going to be a specialist guy, but he's gonna he's gonna be a tremendous nose. The NFL he won't provide much more. Other than that, but you'll be a tremendous run Defender and he can provide some juice from the interior as a pass rusher as well. He's got some he's got some nice moves that he likes to whip out every now and then so I'm looking at a guy like Darren Mack here. That would be my value pick and my best fit.	1.0
So welcome to the Green Bay Packers daylan machen that a wrap up the six-man draft class for the smartdraft simulation from a draft Network here for 2019 notable players afterwards to the underground forward. Jajuan Johnson to the Browns David long to the Vikings sudden Smith to the Titans Antoine Wesley to the Eagles Darius Slayton to Denver white rate of the Rams. Will Grier going to the Patriots to they maybe get another backup quarterback that could be trade bait in four years. Titus Howard to the Falcons final pick of this for round mock was Michael Jackson from Miami over to Philadelphia. So if there are no trays and in the dream scenario, this would be how the Packers would Shape Up according to what Tyler and I have decided to do Brian Burns goes to 12 and no offense goes at 30 Debo Samuel at 44 one Thornhill at 75 Connor McGovern and 114 and daylan Mac at 118 if That were to be the case and if all these pics were to end up in Green Bay, I would be Beyond ecstatic. I would not sleep very well. I would be full of adrenaline and looking forward to driving up to Green Bay and August for training camp and sitting at the fence watching these guys work in pads and making 2019 one of the more exciting years entering that I've had in a while.	1.0
Yeah, this is almost as perfect as it gets and I can almost guarantee. There's going to be craziness on draft night and only Brian gudykunst in his team know who they're looking at and what they're looking for particularly and all we can do is sit here and speculate based off the team needs, but it's fairly how it goes, isn't it?

I'd be over the moon and I great also folks.	1.0

It and she was like know what was it. Was it a pee-pee and I'm like hmm. It was just a PP. Nothing. Nothing else. Not me with said PP not my mom.

That's at Best but I've seen myself in them all and they're like some of the best pictures I mean one time you answered the door and lingerie and it wasn't. Oh no the person you thought it was.

Okay, but like let's talk about how well like Out to dinner and it's like Jaclyn will send nudes to no one and we start talking about who she's like what you want to see this one. This one me like going through her phone at the table. That's what if someone else sees them.	1.0
I'm like you got first of all last night I did that we were moved 47 times and we ended up in a table in the corner and there was no other tables there and I was just showing you and JJ I wasn't going to solve draw because he does not want to see a naked woman.

Best feeling, you know, I like read a meme that said something like it's not a like, I'm bad at this Dad. I know you guys said something along the lines of like you don't have to like beat somebody you're in different races like the concept of kind of like you don't have to bring someone else down just to like succeed and I think that like, We need to continue that like culture around like bring other women up. Don't tear them down. Like we have enough people trying to like pull us back and we need to like help push each other forward absolutely to help each other find our good angles in life and in nudes facts. I love it.

I think we criticize our self enough that like when you can find things you love hmm, like take it and run with it Jaclyn. What's one thing you love about your body? Just one thing. I know what I love about your body what you have the best behind you're gonna say that I mean, they're not bad. They're pretty good. You have like the opposite like you have the best ass.

This is fine. But like it doesn't do much for me. Like what does it do for you? Tell me what it does for you. I so it depends I guess on the situation like I love a good dick pic because I just need all the information like I need to know what your dick looks like. It just makes me feel like we're a friends on a whole nother level. I love that but also like when you get a dick pic, and it's like I caused this dick. To be hard it is the most amazingly like makes me feel like the baddest bitch the hottest bitch, you know, like I did that I guess what I did. I've never thought of that right?	1.0
Doesn't it make you feel good?	1.0
Okay well and it's so we met the stranger will not a stranger like he was a friend of a friend when we went on a vacation recently. And he has this like trick that he does with his dick pics.	1.0

I don't remember the last time I sent one to somebody other than you. So like I'm not sure but it's so funny though because I like love like an unsolicited dick pic. I think I'm in the minority of this category of women. That's like surprised me with a knife. little present like like I'm at work or I'm getting ready to go well and you're getting ready to go out. You're about to get in the shower. Send me a dick pic. I'll be like, yes. Thank you so much.

If they send it through text, yeah, I don't delete any of my texts. Like what do you like save the photo to your photos or like you just leave it in the thread. I have saved them to my photos because like what of might accidentally get deleted but why do you need to save them because what if I want to look at it later, what if I put that like compare and contrast?

Know that you're the baddest bitch. Yes, like feel yourself know yourself like in a really like intimate way right because gonna help so much young you're intimate with somebody else in like I think that is actually what I've realized over the years. Like I've been so much more like open and like willing to like put myself out there a little bit more than I'm used to because I like I'm starting to actually like myself. Oh, yeah, which is so great and I just feel like you Have to do it in your own way and if like you're not comfortable taking a nude, please don't feel like I'm forcing you to although one time. We did Force chaplain 2 times the first time but I have always just been a person I grew up in a naked house like that me my mom would was we were always naked like we had a pool we skinny-dipped before bed because like it was just cool our bodies down my moms, like don't even be naked in the shower.	1.0

So I just feel like being very body positive and I try to like also like bring that out and others It's because I don't I don't think I've talked about this on the podcast yet. But I've had this like weight loss Journey where I was 300 pounds. I still like felt pretty good in my skin at that time. But I've lost like I don't know like a hundred and twenty pounds no big deal. It's like but like learning to like love yourself at both sides and seeing your imperfections because I still feel at this size like not good enough. And like not hot enough and what has really helped me accept myself is actually nudes. If I'm being 100% honest. I've gone from a size 0 to size 6 back down back up and I can find flaws at any size. But I think at some point you just have to look for the things you love as opposed to like picking out the things that you hate right and I still definitely picked myself up are same but it's so helpful to be like, oh my God look at me. I look at like what this body has accomplished always want to look at you. I always want to look at you and I do girlfriend. Look at them bubs. Oh my God, so I guess that's that's the T if you want to take a sip.	1.0

This episode is brought to you by Verizon Verizon is more than a phone company Verizon Prides itself on being a reliable partner for business keeping operations of all sizes ready for what's next with new technology like 5G ultra-wideband Verizon is set to transform the Way businesses operate see how at horizon.com ready. From gimlet media. I'm Josh puccio and this is the pitch. On today's episode a Founder pitches his startup meant to provide TurnKey mobile apps for retailers. He insists it's unlike anything else on the market but in a world where it seems everyone has an app can be convince investors. There's really an opportunity here. Bill Nadel is with Forefront Venture Partners. Phil is all about the numbers will only go in on a deal if you can make the math work. If for some reason the members don't bite then the thing falls apart Jillian Maness is with structure Capital. She's quick to size up the potential in a start-up and its founder and you can count on her to put her money where her mouth is there is no doubt in my mind that you're going to do this. I really feel that Daniel Galati is with Comcast. He loves the high stakes of venture capital and he'll take a gamble on a long shot startup if he senses an opportunity in the billions. I think the only way to make money in VC is to take a non consensus view that turns out to be right and finally on today's episode angel investor James Alta jerr. He looks for Strategic investment opportunities where he can bring his expertise to help us start up really get off the ground. I would be happy to advise your company	1.0
All right before yesterday and now this is a potato chip.	1.0
That's a brand. Yeah, it's a pretzel too, right? They make pretzels to I don't know. So but if you want in the TV show Mad Men even their future that's potato chips. Hey, hello. How are you? How are you? There's a lot of alliteration in that. That's great. Darling Smith darling Smith your mother. I feel like that could be like a superhero name like the secret identity. If Sterling is a superhero, it's safe to say this pitch is his first time donning a cape under the lights in front of the investors. He looks nervous.	1.0
So yeah. Again, my name is Sterling Smith, and I'm the founder and CEO at sandbox Commerce. So so so for four years ago, I decided to leave my my career at a management consulting firm to start sandbox Commerce. So my friend said what the hell are you doing? I had a pretty comfortable potential. It is stay there for the next 20 years for the next 20 years, but I kind of already saw the glass ceiling so I could tell that you know, my limit my options were limited working for that for that company so I decided all right, so Sterling's a little rocky out of the gate, but the story he sharing is your classic entrepreneurial Journey.	1.0
He had a good cushy job as a software developer in DC and was all set to put his career on cruise control for the next 20 plus years, but he got the startup Edge. H and so he traded it all in to move to Austin, Texas and start sandbox Commerce. His company takes the knowledge. He gained as a software developer and puts it to use building mobile apps for retailers.	1.0
What we learned after building several mobile applications for retailers was that it took on average six six weeks for us to build it, but it would shock the retailer would would pay us nearly $250,000 a year.	1.0
Incredibly expensive and Incredibly time-consuming Sterling realized this was a huge pain point for retailers. They want to be able to offer the convenience of an app to their most loyal customers, but customized apps were too costly for most retailers.	0.0
So Sterling created sandbox Commerce to give them a plug and play solution our platform helps those retailers save, you know, six months and nearly $250,000 and it and we've been we've been working on that for about the last eight. 18 months and we believe that sandbox Commerce is a platform that provides opportunities to like no other platform that exist on the market today.	1.0
Sterling hopes to raise $250,000 to help make sandbox Commerce the premier company for retail mobile apps but first he needs to calm his nerves and convince investors. They should take his pitch. Seriously. I'm a retailer and I want to make an app so that people can buy on their phones my products. What do I what do I go to you for?	1.0
Ya. So you simply visit our website you enter some basic information. We use your existing e-commerce platforms API. To pull in your data and then why don't you show us the product?	0.0
I think it'll help us visualize a little bit more. Yeah, so I'm going to show you I'm going to show you two pieces of Sterling pulls out his computer and shows the investors the app designer dashboard, which as the name implies takes you through the steps to easily design your app. And as soon as he starts showing off sandbox Commerce Sterling's Jitters start to melt away. So this dish right here renders in real time.	1.0
So you see how the load this sir is here as you paste those in and then you go to the bottom and click save and view it actually updates in this emulator on the left hand side.	1.0
That's great.	1.0
And do I have to speak with a sales person or anyone before I start know so you come through so we want an IBM ux/ui award for the usability of our looks great.	1.0
So you can come in and just start playing around and editing. I think that's really interesting that it's just low friction way to kind of visualize and	1.0
Up, so effectively a Mobile retailer non-technical person typically in the marketing department would visit our website click, you know, discover sandbox Commerce and an actually go down this list and an inner in all the details.	1.0
At this point it feels like Sterling has hit his stride that nervous shaky founder who opened the pitch is but a distant memory and you can feel it in the room as he grows more confident the investors start to really engage. Okay, and what's the size of red tears?	1.0
Yes. So online retailers who are generating at least a million dollars in Revenue.	1.0
So, why would they need you though? 30 have apps right there you have it.	0.0
But so no, so two percent of retailers have mobile.	0.0
Right now, okay that's shocking to possess it. That's the whole Market which includes we chose doing that's two percent of nothing. That's two positions and number of retailers.	0.0
Yeah. So if you're looking at the the IR 500 which is a sampling of a top 500 retailers in the market 60% of those retailers don't have don't have a mobile app don't have no looks 60 that's shocking don't have any mobile app, and why because it's a very risky proposition if you are a retailer and you You want to build a mobile app and the case of a smaller retailer whose generating a million dollars or more in Revenue? Yes, that retailer spending a quarter of a million dollars the first year to build that mobile application. Yes. Okay. So a brand like Cabela's or Macy's is spending at least a million dollars per app store today. Okay, using our platform. They're spending a fraction of that and so we're giving you with a single SAS fee a turnkey solution that you don't have to worry about.	1.0
This TurnKey solution cost a lot less than that million dollar price tag for a nap on either iOS or Android Sterling's company offers a basic package at $500 a month for a nap in both app stores double that you might be thinking a thousand bucks a month for just a nap. I've seen way cheaper options but not so so Sterling not for what they're building fully native apps.	1.0
Yes, and we are the only company that builds fully native apps. There's their Raps that if you visit a website on your phone, it looks good. It performs well enough but it does it's not as it's not it doesn't perform as well. It doesn't you don't typically have access to your camera. If you need to do augmented reality or you can't really take advantage of location awareness. You really can't take advantage and many cases of push notifications. There are wolves in sheep's clothing that are building mobile apps that you can download from the App Store that are actually using Technologies like PHP without getting the weeds. Those are those are web Technologies. He threw all those wolves. Do you have any put them on I want to really put them out there like that.	0.0
Are we talking are we talking this Squarespace is of the world.	1.0
So not squarespace's although I will well whoever they are.	0.0
These so-called wolves do build mobile apps, but they are not customized to iOS or Android. So they're unable to take advantage of the great technology already built into your phone and therefore their apps kind of suck. But according to Sterling the fact that he's building fully native apps isn't even the best. part of sandbox Commerce	0.0
So the real honey is we are the first company that takes it even one step further. We provide you with the ability to know exactly who those customers are and actually learn from those customers in real time where they live who they are what they liked on Facebook if they're using iPhone 6 Plus or iPhone 5 you're seeing when the last time they open a push notification how many items I have the card you're seeing the detail now on this surface at a micro level that's pretty cool. But at a map Pro level you can say anyone in Austin Texas who is between the ages of 18 and 35 send them a push notification and let them know that we're having a pop-up shop and that if they bring their device they can get free Kool-Aid whatever the heck.	1.0
So this has Sterling would say he is the honey when a customer uses a Retailer's app. Sandbox Commerce is able to collect data about those customers for the retailer. The assumption is of course that this will help them better Market to these customers Amazon for example has an insane amount of data on people's buying habits and they use it to sell more stuff. But if you're a retailer that sells on Amazon you don't get access to that info Amazon Hogs that sweet sweet data for themselves now you Sandbox, Commerce retailers will have their own little stockpile of data. What does that do for them?	1.0
It gives it the moment that I show them this - where the first time they were like, wait. Wow, the first question we showed this they were like, okay the Mobile store Builder was super sick and we've worked with you early on takes to grow the business but this like, okay this is this is special like payday do the data so they learn where the customers are.	1.0
So what did they do with this?	1.0
So so they're sending their adding them to their our email marketing drip campaign. Sorry, they're adding them to their email marketing drip campaigns and beginning to correspond with those customers.	1.0
How does a brand you know, as how does a brand convince users? Hey, you need our app as opposed to finding us on the web and Amazon Walmart.	1.0
Excellent question a company like any brand can do this the example that I can give Jayla body. Oh, they have their customers when they purchase their headphones from Best Buy Target and Best Buy Target or am On and the packaging they have a getting started guide that says hey first charge up your headphones then download the mobile app, then go to this custom screen that I developed using sandbox Commerce and and follow the steps to actually burn in your headphones and say and the enemy another come give me an example of something. So beard.com which would send in a coupon that says take off 15% of your mobile application of your your razor your You're shaving cream of your next purchase. If you download the application and enter this dish that sounds like through all post-purchase incentives.	1.0
Right? Are you concerned that generally consumers don't like to download more apps any more so because they have so many and so that that is that was a preconception that that's a commonly held belief.	0.0
I think that there are a couple reasons why that that is that that is not necessarily the case. So for example, so the 20s And if folks that download the apps tip brands app is a brand Enthusiast.	1.0
They're already following them on Snapchat Instagram and Facebook and that that 20% typically generates 80% of the revenue the if they have a compelling reason for every retailer to get their customers to download an app and it's I don't think it's easy to do.	1.0
We're really focusing on driving and customer engagement, but the but the reality of the situation is that a customer doesn't need to keep the app on their phone a customer simply needs a login one time and you've Got that valuable data, they can download the app register one time and delete the app and you've got the data.	1.0
So it's Sterling is basically saying is hey, we don't even need people to use the apps. We make for retailers. All they need to do is get people to download the app and sign in one time and Sterling gets this Treasure Trove of data that he can pass on to his retailers to tell us about the IP around this. Do you have patents around this as obviously proprietary proprietary?	1.0
Are we don't have any patents at this moment? Have you found someone with we are the process of filing a provisional patent for one of the things that we're working on?	1.0
I think we're Jillian's getting out is where is the defensibility here? I've been long time. Right? So we see Squarespace. We see all the platforms Magento Shopify etcetera and we're kind of thinking are they gonna do this? And one of the answers could be you have some you have all these data right? And so is there some sort of Data Network effect.	1.0
There's a network effect.	1.0
You get all this data from all these retailers and that makes you sort of Target better. And yeah, so that's don't talk to that. For those not already in the no network effect is when the more people use something the better the product becomes for example. Google is a popular search engine. So more people tend to use it and the more people who use it the better the search results it gives because Google is learning from every single user and this is one of the reasons why it is so hard to knock off big tech companies. They have such a massive Head Start in refining their product.	1.0
The network effect is a very important component. That once we have a hundred retailers on a platform we then have industry information. I think that's really interesting. So no and so that's that's really what we're talking about that a little bit on my phone. So so many companies we I'm talking to you fast. Sorry. It's okay. We are a we are the we are presenting ourselves to be that leader that thought leader in this space. We have a ton of information. We have a head start. What we need is investment dollars to help us Market this platform. It's ready to go.	1.0
But where I was going with something more specific which is how does retailer 103 benefit from the hundred to retailers that you already have. You've got all this data around these audio. What's that company's name? Jjolbodyo. Jjolbodyo is customers, right, you know the names of the customers, you know, their purchase frequency, you know their usage frequency. And so if you get the third Audio company signing on to sandbox, can we cross marker two different customer bases? Can we say? And across different an economist lie, and and that's where I think it becomes really defensible and really valuable is if we can if we can say to the thousandth customer you benefit from the 999 other customers that already signed on the network effect of the data and the but the ability to provide even our existing retailers with automated information about the data, you know on a recurring basis, huh? But it's Daniels vision of the of the network effect is	1.0
And but I don't know if that's your business not so yes Daniel articulated and part Danny took my thunder and part. Thank you. That's it. I don't know. I think Thunder stealer. I know I thank you for that barring your thumb to give you do due diligence there. The reality situation is at almost every company that you hear from on the pitch is going is needs to be moving toward machine learning and artificial intelligence. And I think that as we grow and we them More customers we have the more valuable the business gets and so as we grow that Network effect provides us with industry data based on verticals like a pit like apparel Electronics, etc. For each of Our Brands that industry is gay this seems different to me than the network effect.	1.0
You're referring to where I as the Thousand customer benefit from all previous. It's uncertain whether Daniel and Sterling are really on the same page here, but it may not matter. They both agree that the more retailers Sterling has the more valuable his overall product is so how many retailers does he have? So you how many customers do you have now?	1.0
So we've got so we've got did bait. Eighth of a tan beta we've got we've got 10 paying customers. So what's that in Revenue? 5,000 a month. She 5,000 ninth yesterday. Yeah, and then the others are we're converting. We're still learning from those customers.	1.0
It seems like he built a really great product and can totally see retailers using a I just want to understand is this a 10 million hundred million billion 10 billion dollar Marty six billion dollar market. So, how do you so let me tell you how I would think about Market size images you say you're going after the Middle Market right 10 million 250 million hundred ten million 100 million in Revenue. I think about Market size is how many retailers exist in that sort of bucket. How many of them don't have an A. Nap and what's your sort of annual price per retailer really backing through to the market? I just worry that we're going after a nice hundred million dollar market but not a ten billion dollar market, excellent. So the total addressable addressable Market our addressable Market is 6 as 36 billion dollars currently right now, but you and that's yeah, you can't think you can't think of it as total retail Stan you got to think about it as what Revenue can we get from our Target? But he said that their issues billion years being spent by these retailers on mobile. If you look you're not going to get right you're gonna we're gonna work.	0.0
We'll get it. We'll get a person. Yes, I like that.	1.0
Yeah, I don't like that percentage. So that's like saying yeah, everybody in China needs a refrigerator. I get 1% of that, but that's why we need to go bottom up and he talked about how many retail basically Daniel is saying. Yeah, maybe you can estimate your Market at 36 billion but chances are it's a lot It's smaller than that maybe even closer to a hundred million. And if you're playing on the level that these investors are that distinction is pretty crucial and how much you Rising now, we're raising.	0.0
So we're raising a bridge round effectively to focus on sales and marketing we cells in marketing and at 250 right now and we've already got a hundred committed to 250 raising 250 bridge at what valuation 5 million to invest any of your own money about 50.	1.0
Okay. So this is your all and I'm not	0.0
That's critical. So the reason why we're raising 250, I didn't get to that point yet. The reason why we're raising 250 is because we are 20 customers away from being profitable 20 pounds.	0.0
So your goal for this business is to heck no before Daniel can even ask so your goal is just to get to profitability Sterling is all over this question.	1.0
I just I'm able to go to the table with it from a different perspective as a profitable entrepreneur and so in January with	1.0
This 250 I want to raise a much larger round relatively speaking and really go and really own this market Sterling is wanting to raise the 250 now to help them get to profitability with the plan of raising a much larger round in 2018. Sterling has made his pitch now it's decision time. Here's Daniel is how I feel which is I I'm a huge believer in Sterling Smith the founder. I think you're super Scrappy. I think you've pulled together a team on not that much money and you've frankly built a product that I think at least looks great relative to the other, you know, many quasi competitors or similar products that I've seen in the market my my I'm going to hold off on committing here because my biggest question is Good size. So I don't yet know how big if you get 50% market share or 20 percent market share of your target retailers. And I think all businesses need to start somewhere. I get the we're going after Nan retailers and I get that, you know story but I think you're going to have to nail your target sort of mid-market retail segment. First So my answer is I think it's really interesting. Would love to connect with you after the fact on Market size. Excellent. That's Amelia actually there. Really good segue to my control, which is I want to invest in a company where I can pour fuel on the fire where you have a scalable way of acquiring customers and I can add money to it that will let you explode that that's not here yet. Plus I'm afraid you're not raising enough money. You're going to go back and raise again, very soon. Your focus is going to have to be on fundraising and not on sales and marketing. I appreciate that and and that that's a distraction to me. That's a distraction. I'm concerned about for you.	0.0
understand	1.0
For those Reasons, I'm going to have to pass. Daniel and Phil are out. Here's Jillian. You look very competent and I like you. I agree. You are Scrappy you are confident. You are very well educated and every single point and challenge. We have thrown at you. I like you a lot and I want invest in you. Okay, very hard stop it period but there is there a couple of caveats.	1.0
Don't worry. Okay.	1.0
So here's a couple things first of all, I don't think you're raising enough. All right, I'd like you to meet my team my structure team at structure Capital One of my guys Jacob Shay is here in New York now, so I want you to sit down with him. He's the tech guy he was as you know, he's slams it and it's so I want him to start diving into this but I invest in people and a lot of ways and I worry about your defense ability and a very big way. Okay, but the fact is is that I think you have something truly special in yourself and I see it and I want to be a part of this and so let's take the next step. So right I can't commit a dollar sign until I really do a little bit more due diligence. I'm going to hook you up with Jake up in the next couple of days and why don't we carry on that conversation as that is	0.0
That sounds like an excellent plan and I really appreciate your confidence there. Okay?	1.0
Jillian is in though. She's not putting a dollar figure on it quite yet. Here's James. I think you're excellent. And you're in a right progression in your career. One weakness. I see with you is that you haven't sold a business nor has anyone on your team. So it's very important almost as important as the other skills combined and so you don't have that and that's that's a significant weakness, but you do I do and so I I would be willing to fill up this bridge by the way. I'm not a venture firm. This is with me with skin in the game. I'd be willing to fill up your round which I think you said this about this about a hundred or hundred fifty left. Yeah, so I'd be willing to fill up that round or what work with Jillian. I'm filling up that round and and and I would require a board seat with some significant voting rights given that I think I would have more experience than anybody who currently have at the moment awesome.	1.0
Your Stellar your Sterling. Thank you so much.	1.0
I'm very sure that I know never I'm so sorry. I'm not very you know talented on this but I really I think you're really special really appreciate and I look forward to getting to know you better and I'll give ring Jacob a ring at the right.	1.0
Absolutely and I'm here until tomorrow. I can leave a little bit later if I need to I think you probably would have to that's not a problem. Fantastic. It looks darling. No, he's not. Thank you for coming and thank you so much pleasure meeting you all.	1.0
By the way, we don't know if he accepted my offer.	0.0
I accept your offer.	1.0
Absolutely. So we're going to get. After Sterling leaves the room the investors debrief. He was awesome. He was so hard to say you only anything but yes to I mean I can see I can find people for his company right now. I know great salesperson for his company. I think you're also getting in at a good like a potentially a great price. Right? If this guy you couldn't profitability or the structure rounds think that's mocked up, you know, once he hits 20 customers, he's gonna do this. Okay he's going to do there is no stopping this guy you can tell and every time we threw something over the bow is Shot over the bow. He would shoot right back in a very very low respectful way. Sorry, man. But yeah exactly. I have to you think he'll meet I'm hoping he meets with your team. He's going to meet with them today.	1.0
Absolutely and then we'll we'll get in touch as well.	1.0
After the break I call Sterling to find out if that meeting with Jillian's team ended up happening and where things stand with the Investments made on the show.

So Verizon keeps business ready for what's next find out how at Verizon.com ready? Welcome back four months after Sterling came on the pitch. I gave him a call to hear what he thought of his experience pitching to investors and to find out what's happened with the investments from Jillian and James. What do you remember from the pitch what sticks out to you?	1.0
Basically I felt very nervous out the gate. I was incredibly nervous and it was in my opinion. It was reflected in the pitch because I honestly my opening was Completely different than then I had prepared for and I just kind of got caught off guard by how nervous I was at the very beginning and then I kind of got my bearings back and then I felt good and after a few minutes, so after you get in the room you start pitching so you're obviously a little bit nervous up front.	0.0
But you you hit your stride. The investors were like really grilling you I mean like they were asking the right questions like imagining different use cases. Is for your product like did you think things were going?	0.0
Well, yes within a few moments. I had an idea who I should really be speaking to because it seemed evident that you know, and it's like a lot of pitches to you know, you probably heard when speaking with other entrepreneurs that we've pitched hundreds of times to Angel Investors or VCS and you know, the ones that get it and you want, you know, the ones that don't and there's very little that you can do.	1.0
My experience to you know, bring the real someone in who's not engaged.	1.0
Yeah, exactly. So who was engaged so I James I mean the whole time James got it. He got it. It was like like I like I was speaking to his soul and then I also felt like Jillian got it, but Jillian was Gillian was also incredibly, you know, she's Savvy as hell and so I mean like she is incredibly Savvy and so like A person like that can like you know, you think that they may have it but you're not sure until they say yes, you know and the other folks I could tell were like they're asking really good questions. So I think they were trying to get there but for whatever reason they couldn't respect, you know, but generally speaking, you know, I could tell that Jillian and James got it.	1.0
That's so interesting because from my end. I'm sitting in the control room and I couldn't tell what James was feeling. Because he wasn't saying much and so when he all of the sudden says I want to put in a hundred fifty K and I want to lead the round. I was completely stunned like what did that feel like in that moment?	1.0
I mean it felt I can't I can't describe it Josh. I mean, I wish I could I was in I was exhilarated and you know coming back and speaking with some of our current investors about James excitement about coming on board. You know, it's one of those situations to where they were like, oh man James. Oh he is awesome weed and he's he can really make an impact on your business and a positive way and so congratulations that kind of thing.	1.0
All right. So yeah what And after the pitch, did you go into due diligence with him? Like what like what happened with James?	1.0
Yeah. So we nothing happened James has not invested yet.	0.0
Wait what really?	0.0
No, he has not invested yet.	0.0
I mean you emailed him right like you were up.	1.0
Yeah. I mean I did I tried to I try to tread that fine line between persistence and you know annoyance and I definitely I would you know, I'd I tried the hey, I'll be in New York next week. I'd love to grab coffee or are you available to jump on a call at your convenience schedule a few times and I'll person over a few times and also shall respond with a calendar invitation.	0.0
Okay. So like you've heard nothing nothing from it.	0.0
He did like one of my one of my tweets so so oh, that's great.	1.0
That's really helpful. I mean	1.0
It does suck and not to not to downplay it, but you know. Part of my job is to secure. The bag part of my job is to do what it takes to close it. And you know, if I if I can't do that and or if the if the investor commit sin doesn't like I don't take it personally at all, you know. Any number of any number of things could have happened in his life that changed changed that and and you know, I'm I don't hold it against him frankly. You know, it's just it is what it is.	0.0
Yeah, I'm surprised you're taking this.	0.0
So well, it's been you know initially like in the in the heat of it Josh and then the heat of it like as I'm leaving the pitch back, you know back in Austin. I'm on cloud and Cloud Nine I go through all the steps, you know, it's important for me to be persistent with all investors including James and initially it was tough. If it was very tough because that it felt like a lock when I walked off of the off of the stage. Yeah, and so initially it sucked and worst case scenario of everything bust that we've got a whole lot of other great things going on for us. So we're not you know, I can't I'm not going to dwell on that because I'd still be stuck there and not making the progress we're making right now.	0.0
So I have to say I'm really sorry that this happened like that we brought on an investor on our show. That's this flaky.	0.0
I mean if I recall you're definitely human.	1.0
So I gotta say this news about James really took me aback. It felt like there had to be more to the story. So I've been calling emailing texting whatever I can do to get ahold of James and so far nothing. He hasn't even liked one of my tweets, but in all seriousness, I'm not as much bothered that he isn't responding to me. What bothers me is that he's blowing off Sterling it's fine if he changed his mind about investing these things happen, but it feels like At least pick up the phone and tell Sterling that the good news is James wasn't the only one who invested in sandbox Commerce. Okay. Well so Jillian also invested on the show what happened with that? I mean she didn't ghost on you two. Did she know? All right, so she mentioned she would introduce you to her partner Jacob did that end up happening?	0.0
Yeah, so I actually met met Jacob at the Ace Hotel that The same that very same day the night of the pitch the night of the pitch Jillian maybe she made a three-way Texans like you need to ghost meet with meet with Jacob.	1.0
We should have followed you there with a microphone.	1.0
So I met him I made a beeline to the Ace Hotel and and you know, there there are traditional VC and keeping in mind, you know, we're raising we were raising a little bit less than you know, what a seed stage investor would Best so we were raising 250 and so the discussion we're actively having with structure is you know, do we come in in this round potentially or do we come in and your price round and in the first quarter of 2018 and so that's and it's so that's a that's a and they've been incredibly responsive we've gone through due diligence as well. So that's going really well.	1.0
So it sounds like things are moving forward with Jillian. She may find this bridge round, but it sounds more likely that she instructor Capital could end up making an even bigger investment in the round Sterling is Raising this January and even more importantly Sterling is undaunted by any of the setbacks. He's encountered so far, which I think in the long run is going to serve him. Well, we can't wait to hear how it all turns out for him. We've got a brand new episode for you next week stay tuned after the credits to hear scenes from that episode. Our show is produced by me Josh. Cuchillo Molly Donahue and Kareem Maddox.

Next week on the pitch. I was this woman who loved shopping. I had nice shoes and nice pants jeans and purses and to be totally honest with you. I had a bra that I was wearing that was probably five years past. It's expiration date and it just hit me.	1.0
Why are all these other companies coming out with an easier way to buy a more fairly priced commodity yet. A woman's most basic commodity is still so hard to buy.	1.0
How does kind of this Stitch fix model work in the underwear category? Like do you see friction on the consumer side? I'd and if I told you where I bought my bras, you would die a thousand deaths same here. New episodes come out on Wednesdays at 12 p.m. Eastern make sure you're subscribed wherever you listen.	1.0
I want to share with you my story of my appreciation of self. Or another way to put it it's myself love story.	1.0
So I didn't even understand the whole self-love thing until like pretty recently to be honest. I kind of I guess any type of healing Journey any type of growth inner growth type of Journey.	0.0
It really kind of just Falls along the lines of self-love and sense, right? So my journey started in I will say the 10th grade ninth grade summer around 10th grade. So around that time I had I got coaching Miracles coaching, you know, they work with Law of Attraction but also really heavy on subconscious mind programming like NLP neuro-linguistic programming. So it's basically we do this these deep visualization almost hypnotic exercises that take me to you know, certain memories. It's traumas and just limiting beliefs and things of that. Nature and we cleared it. You're going to notice that all why I've noticed that all these negative emotions. These stuck traumas are all tied to limiting beliefs without limiting beliefs. There will be no trauma and that may be controversial but this is coming from someone who's done the work, right? And this is what I've experienced.	0.0
So that was that I did a lot of subconscious mind stuff, right and I start to feel better about myself because Because my whole life I've never felt good enough. That was the major thing.	1.0
I always felt like shit. I always felt like damn. I'm such a loser I suck at everything and I can't impress nobody blah blah, and I've always wanted to feel good enough.	0.0
well	1.0
I think it was. Two years at least one of the heat year into this subconscious mind clearing Journey that I work with this lady named Shelly lefko. And you know, she heard her husband. They they're like the best at this clearing limiting beliefs stuff like the best. And I was working with her and you know, I was telling her, you know, I've been doing a lot of work. I'm trying to feel good enough, but you know, like there's something a little bit off. I've made a lot of progress but I don't necessarily feel like I'm over it. I don't feel good enough and then we spent an hour working on this going back to my childhood going up and looking at my past conditioning and then but any of the conversations The last few words. She said absolutely shifted my Paradigm completely. she said nobody is special. because everybody is special and because everybody special nobody is special. And boom that was it.	1.0
That was the moment. I could feel that shift within me as I realized the truth the truth that you don't have to prove. No one has no one is born having to proof if they're good enough or not. We are all born the fact that we are born the fact that we exist makes us good enough. We are always already always will be good enough. We are all special. We are all completely special does not matter if you have certain abilities or not doesn't matter if you failed a billion times in your past. You will always be special but everybody is special. So nobody is extra special special or any less special than anybody else no matter which Soul was human what color how tall you are how big you are how small you are it don't matter. And so, you know I go that was a big shift for me that realization.	1.0
Right and I felt like oh my gosh, I no longer have this negative burden, right? So that was cool. And then so I and then in 2016 as many of you know, I had that deep experience where so this is a few months later after that. I had this deep experience where I became president. I became really present and my mind stopped and I This deep peace. I achieved this realization of self. I realized I am. Not my mind. I understood that I was I was Consciousness and beyond that once you realize that you are liberated.	1.0
But anyways, so, you know now I have this deep peace and I've gone through the whole the whole, you know, like realization that everything that nobody special because everybody special right? So and so like I was cool.	1.0
But you know, it wasn't like I was waking up every day and thinking oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I love myself. Like dude. You're just you're just a total stud. You're super special.	0.0
Like it wasn't like that.	0.0
You know, like I just kind of felt whatever like it was just kind of like, okay, I'm not not special anymore.	0.0
I don't feel I know for a fact.	1.0
I don't feel not special anymore, and I've noticed wow like as I'm growing like I am definitely somewhat extra extraordinary in terms of like just my abilities against my peer like or just you know, like around the common people the people at work and just everybody else in my life. I was definitely I stood out like I just had because of my presence because of the fact that my mind is basically silent, you know like you when you're acting on Divine instincts. You naturally are just pretty Next Level and you just always the Right Moves or something, right?	1.0
But anyways, so June 5th. I made the decision to raise my vibration.	1.0
I learned all this stuff about vibration and I'm going to use it.	1.0
So I start raising my vibration. It's been three months in and my whole reality my whole life starts to pick up like crazy like all these toxic people just get strands are leave my life and then like my parents who are extremely negative and toxic or completely transformed like everything starts to go good my Following blows up in everything and everything's just getting better and better and better and better and better and whatever right but one of the craziest things I noticed lately is my own inner self talk like what I what I can catch myself just hyping myself up nowadays. Nowadays, once I wrote raise my vibration consistently now, I'm like my own biggest fan now. I'm just like my gosh like damn. You're fucking fantastic.	1.0
Like you're just like you figure all this shit out.	1.0
You figure shit out that like no but like most people your age hasn't figured out yet and you're doing amazing and like literally just hiding myself up. I just naturally in like by accident nowadays.	1.0
It just happens.	1.0
I'm always like just loving this body this human meat suit that mean like I love What body what Consciousness is what person what mind I'm put in like I'm just so grateful for myself nowadays is crazy. And and I think it's just because I'm in high vibration and I feel good all the time. And now I'm just like really appreciating myself. I didn't know it was possible. I thought self-love just means this neutral place. But no there's a positive place. There's a place where you your your biggest fan.	1.0
Like you just fucking love yourself like damn you could be like making hot tea you be like damn I make the best fucking hot tea in the fucking world like damn.	1.0
It could be anything and you're just you're just loving yourself and man like you just it's just so crazy In like it's totally possible to get to this place of just consistently feeling amazing. All the time once you figure this out, especially if you check out my online and free Academy that's coming out. I'll teach you how to do all of this and you're going to find yourself just feeling fantastic.	1.0
And the thing is you don't have to like figure out your limiting beliefs. You just got to raise your vibration everything else the negative will take care of itself when you raise your vibration.	1.0
You start to heal you figure things out.	1.0
You will I promise that like just take it from my experience and man you get to this place where it's just like man. It's crazy. It's crazy. And I found this by accident like I've never been like man, I want to love myself. I never even knew what that meant. But like I've realized lately. Oh my gosh, this is what self-love is. So I can't wait for you guys to do this vibrational work like once you once you raise your vibration consistently all the good things start to come. Until you're just overwhelmed with this positive momentum. Because because of the Law of Attraction you're either going more and more towards negative or more and more in the positive direction. You're going one way or the other this train is going one way or the other. so Thank you for listening. In a few weeks. I should be have my online free online Academy up. It's it's just a video course with me talking about everything. I know about vibrations everything that I taught here in Moore from A to Z in a comprehensible way lesson. The lesson lesson I break down every concept video by video and You will be able to learn just everything just about everything that I know and they're in a very organized way.

Welcome everybody to another episode of bucking stock news podcast powered by two Bulls performance feeds Thor this this episode may be a little different kind of interested talk a little bucking horses.	1.0
Yeah, for sure. So our guest today is the owner/operator of Bridwell Pro rodeos Tim Brig. Well, how are you? I'm good.	1.0
I'm good. Thanks for having me.	1.0
Oh, no worries. It's kind of going to be learning experience for us all.	1.0
That will then in the horse deal for a very short time like a short six months.	1.0
Is that how long you had them probably?	1.0
So yeah, it's my fire got put out real fast.	0.0
But anyway, so so you you guys are recent on on the the Bridwell card, correct?	1.0
Yeah. So for to give you a little back story I was a Bull rider not a very good one. I wrote both, you know through high school and college and instead started and I guess I bought my Pro card in 96 anyway, and I rode around and got on lot of balls on the west coast. What it what had happened is I do to getting beat up and Andrew and stuff. I kind of had to give it up yum. I was only 25 or 24 when I quit But I threw getting on a lot of bulls out here on the West Coast. I became friends with Don Kish and getting on his balls all the time and go to go into their rodeos when I got beat up real good. The last time I guess 99 there. I he he called me when I was in the hospital and get offered me a job to come out and weld for it. Well, I was beat up and like I said, he beat up enough to where I can. I couldn't do too much like couldn't lift too much or do too much buddy buddy called and we had been like I said friends before need any dawn said would you like to come home and and weld for me? I'm trying to build this feed lots of these bulls. And and all I had to do is set in well, you guys are probably familiar with putting up pipe and cable fins. And and so I just had to set there and weld them the Milliron on the post to run the cable through and so on that that winter I came or well, I got hurt at Fort Worth. So it was about this time of the year anyway, and that came home and welded for dog. Well, anyway, it evolved into going to work for he and John crowning and and I work for the rodeo company therefore started in 99 and started, you know, discontinued helping Dawn with bulls and then really started getting involved with the horse part of it. You know while working for the rodeo company and then No.5 John offered me an opportunity to buy into the company and by the horses from the company which Saudi I did definitely at the time they they provided the horses and Don had two bullets on the ground. Right? Right. That's exactly right. So John own on the horses and then Dawn on the Bulls and then John also on the time of in cattle. I guess. That's anyway. and so through working around there for four or five years there and I started flanking the horses I guess and probably like oh three and then again just got an opportunity there and bought the horses and oh five and and then kind of well, I don't want this to sound wrong. But you know the horse program when I bought it and I'll five it was it was struggling, you know, there was I think there was a couple or three maybe horses going to the final and and and not a real real and I don't want this to come across like I'm saying anything derogatory. I'm not I'm not I'm just kind of trying to lay out the facts the breeding program. For the horses wasn't real organized. You know, there was kind of not sure what calls were out of what two mares. You know, there was some paperwork loss. You know, it's kind of a oh, yeah Club not a real not a real organized situation and not hey and not to say that I don't feel have some hiccups here and there today. I'm just saying, you know five it was in there was a lot of I did all the information wasn't there. But anyway, So then what I did is, you know first thing I did when after buying the horses sorted up the mayor's kind of got the you know, the mayor's that I thought were the best Mayors and certainly as we all know if you raise bucking stock you the ones you think that are the best at the you know, your first year or two into it, maybe they're not the best and and and then the one that you're that you don't breed all the sudden, you know later on you wished you kick yourself in the butt and think gosh. should have been breeding them are you know, she she was at first maybe wasn't the shiniest one in the herd, but you know, they stay hooked and they stay you know, they just stay solid and today that's the one thing I've learned now being, you know, whatever 13 years 14 years into this but one thing I have learned is the ones that are solid and consistent for me the mayor's that do that seem to be the ones that raised the better horses the that they've The Bucks in them. They're just they maybe aren't the most talented but they give it to you every time they might only be in 1819 pointer. But if they do that out of her time, that's probably in my experience that's you know, only 13 14 years into this pretty Limited in the horse industry because you know, you think of them other guys, I was talking about earlier. Oh, yeah, you guys that there's there's like guys like a cork. Oh they've been doing this 50 50 years, you know, so so when I talk about 13 or 14 Teen years. I might my experience is a little bit limited compared to those guys obviously, but in my limited amount of time here going back to what I thought the solemn are the ones that just give it to you what they what they can every time and and do something every time 1819 Point hoppers for me. Those have been the ones that have been the best moms, you know, and I don't know why that is. I wish I had a magic ball to look into and figure out why that is but But you know the the the ones that jump out there and just make your mouth water rank as hell one time. And then the next time maybe aren't as shiny. They the consistency it for whatever reason that that genetic trait of consistency doesn't doesn't carry on to their you know, their Colts have that same enemy. You know what they're just not consistent in any way so that send the Colts out of those.	0.0
Distant horses tend to outperform their mothers in the arena. I would word of it out.	1.0
I wouldn't say necessarily outperform but the consistent mayor's brain trays you fucker they raised in something, you know, and yes, I have I have some errors that yeah, they're there. I'll give you an example. I had a little old mare 124 her name is classy cat. And so that married be like how she be 18 now, but every cult we've got out of her box there and like to some degree like whether it's shining really in a far potential or dis good, you know, and and in fact, I don't think I have one that's went to the NFR yet, but I got a couple cold. That sure look like they're suspects it just matter of whether they stay healthy and and continue on what they're doing. But but she was probably only I'm in today's world. I would say she'd struggle to be an 18-point her. She was just a hopper. She had cool a cool style. She just wasn't that shiny, you know, and but her cult certainly outperform her that's that's for sure. But at the same time You know, she wasn't very big or was it still have her so she isn't very big and and and just not very talented. You know, it's sort of like a like a football player, you know, if you're not that big and strong it's pretty hard to be very good at it. Yeah, but but he cried but big doesn't doesn't things with her and she's yeah those coats are showing up pretty good, you know, so so in 2005 kind of when you took over the whole deal what What was the stud that you put out and how how to his cult perform? Well the first the first year so okay, so I bought the horses in the fall of o5. And so the actually the mayor's were already bread. So I didn't really make a stud decision until the spring of o6. The spring of o6. I went and I leased a stud and I am so thankful. For that now I went back and I kind of I was kind of a little bit rough earlier when we were talking about how that some of the old-timers are and when I say Old Timers, I mean the the established bucking horse programs. They didn't they weren't really willing to share intellectual property with you and they were pretty pretty quiet and tight-lipped about what they were doing. Well, I was very lucky. I become friends with with the Sankey family and in the spring of oh sick. Exile East a stud from Ike and his name was star belly sneech and so star start at least it was just kind of okay, but he wasn't that good of a boxer himself, but he is Mom was Cindy Lou Who and Cindy Lou Who who was among a really famous mayor. I had that went to the NFR bunch of times and she was a daughter of Custer, huh? I believe I don't have a pedigree chart in front of me, but is if I may Serves me correct correctly Cindy Lou was a it was an own daughter a Custer and and then that sire to Star belly sneech was a stud of cork owes name confused velvet and he was and he was a really good sire. Like they had a lot of luck with that horse. And so anyway, I took start releasing each and brought him to the mayor's like I told you guys earlier that I thought were the best. You know of what we when I had bought from from them guys and when you say that you mean like the best as far as bucking horses are the best that you thought would be the best broodmare type forces. Well a little of both right? So what's the one thing that I did also a little bit different when I first started I knew I was behind the 8-ball little bit and all five or o6 when I first put this done out with the mirror. I know I was behind me. ball as far as in terms of I told you guys earlier that the breeding program that that I bought, you know wasn't real organized completely mined out on what what matters were produced and what stuff for the what and got out of it was just kind of just a bunch of horses really and so what I did is started, you know, but, you know, obviously with bucks who we had all our old mares and boxes and stuff, but then I went to bucking some young mares and and doing some stuff that way and then I started breeding some young mares like some three and four-year-old Billy's to to try and get ahead of the curve and it wasn't that I wanted to turn those those fillies in the broodmares at all. That wasn't my intent. It was just to get a cult out of him to get to get ahead of the game a little bit and and and and I use you know, a couple things, you know to decide number one was obviously Secondly was was the you know the pedigree of the mayor but but again, like I told you that wasn't completely organized. So it was kind of kind of kind of sorts to navigate through that but then the other thing was confirmation, you know, I talked a little bit ago about classic at one of the one her problems was why she couldn't Buck any harder or be any better than she was just for confirmation. She was too small and built a little bit wrong. To be to be really rank, you know are really good. So, you know, you can almost look at a horse and see what how is Styles going to work? You know, how he's going to block? You know, a good example is Butler's you know, Benny Butler you guys are familiar with that and I'm sure everybody knows Benny Butler Rodeo business. Well, they're there the way their horses are bit built their big kind of lanky kind of raw. Bone horse. And they got usually a highway others, you know, and they're they're just built to where you know, they're going to be dropping they're going to Buck hard and they're gonna be dropping and they're athletic they're really built that way and and so that and so in terms or in turn built any does have a lot of stronger horses that will turkana guy and Buck Em Off. Yeah, I mean and but they also can be 90 on them, but they're just they're built that way then on the flip side of that you can go and look at Like Kirby's heard in Utah the Kirby family their horses are a little bit smaller not as high withered little more kind of I don't want to sound say I'm wrong because I don't want to be like I'm down on them because they're awesome horses. They're just kind of like a little fat horses, you know and very little and so because of that because I have some of them to they Hawk they're really the guys because they're little bit. They're not as They're not built to be strong. They're you know, they're really effective and they have cool Styles and they're really flashy but they're not going to they're not going to block anybody off because they're just not built to do it. So yeah, that's that's certainly a big component in the bucking horses deal is is the confirmation, you know, you have obviously the pedigree but the confirmation means a lot that's interesting. So you said that you were namely blessed to get that stud. I mean it was where the first set of Coach really good or how to pan out.	0.0
Well, so yeah. No, I mean I'm not going to sit here and say they're the best ever but they were awful good like well one cult in particular I actually sold in the security and I think it was like 2012. Well, it's see I would have been 2012. I sold a horse. Pony man, he belongs to stay Smith now and he was he was out of that cult crop, you know, and then there was you know, he was by far the shiniest one. I mean, I guess I sold him to stay. I'm pretty sure it was 2012. He bought him there at the Benny Binion sailed, you know the bucking horse or a bucking horse security actually stays puts it on and and yeah, so Smith, I'd buck that colt there and Smith. Bought him and I think he's been to the NFR every year since like, oh, well, yeah, he's he was the shiniest one by far and then oh, I have a few other ones that are just really nice horses, you know that route. And so I think that first whole crop, but probably had well I'm going to say I can't I don't recall but I'm gonna say between 15 and 20 Colts to start with and I'm about I have when do you start those horses? I'm sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Wendy's start those horses, you know, how long is it before you start to know if you made the right breeding decision? Oh, well, sometimes a level five years, but for that particular to answer your question directly, the first part of the question was, you know, when do we start a I start dummy are blocking the Colts when they're too and and and I just dummy buckham once when they're to unless they just flat run off if they just flat run off. Then on my block him again, you know and do something a little bit different just but I bought them wants when they're two or twice. Like I said and then same when there's three and then so then when therefore I get people on them, you know, they start with their Riders. So a lot of them a lot of them horses have anywhere from two three, maybe four trips by the time they're four year olds, and then then it's time for a rider and and sometimes you know, they They you know, if you can see that they're pretty sure of their feet and their they have a really controlled style and they're you know, they're when I say a controlled style, you know, like the akkad. I got a pattern and they're like I said their feet are running room and all that's going on good and I feel confident. I'll stay up and not fall down with the guy. So I'll go ahead and put a guy on him with a couple of dummy trips and then and then the other ones, you know, there's those horses that I've Listen, I hate to admit it but there's horses. I've raised it. It took six or eight trips to before I felt confident to put a guy on it because it was all down all of ya and and generally that's the wild or wasn't it and going back to the breeding. That's when they're bred wrong. They're too wild and you know bucking horses. Sometimes the the Layman fan gives bucking horses a bad rap like they're there and I shouldn't that sounds wrong. I got I wish I could I was better with my words, but They get kind of a bad rap like her wild and yeah, you guys know that's that's not the case at all. Some of these some of these horses are really gentle and really good to be around and and and generally speaking is the more quiet they learn calm. They learned Focus. They are the better bucking horses. They are they you know, they don't have to be Wild Buck. We all know that what a maybe this is a silly question, but I'm not a bucking horse guy got on some back in the day and never never did any good at it? Didn't ever understand it but aside from just sighs. How do you how do you choose which which event you want to Buck those horses a cracker or saddle bro? Yes. That's a really good question for me. First of all, you're going to see when you dummy block them kind of what they do with their head. And when I was talking a minute ago about the control their body control while there while they're bucking with just a dummy on that gives you a little bit of an indication of what event to do to put them in. in butt butt For me, I found more of their mother. So if their mother could take the bronc riding and tolerated it and she liked it and bucks in it. The Colts in seems to do that, you know, tools will follow suit now that's not always the case but a lot of the time it is, you know, an in an unfortunately the way as the way the rodeo business is now with the shorts. Age of bareback Riders, sometimes you are forced to put Colts in the bronc riding that you're not 100% sure if it's going to work or not when you're first blocking them around but sometimes there's it works out beautifully. Sometimes it doesn't but for the most part you kind of got a number one go with their style number two kind of their mom and then third the availability of the riders that are there that day you have very many of those horses that you may be starting. In one event and then decide that they need to go to the other event, or maybe they do both events or oh absolutely. So so I have a horse named Capone and he's been in a far five times. I think or maybe six and his mom is out of one of our famous men as Raggedy Ann. Well when I first started bucking Capone, he was a bare back and he went to the finals like for three or four times and bareback, you know in the bareback riding.	1.0
Like I said and then	1.0
What happened was he kind of started moving out started covering too much ground getting a little bit long and away and then and then we moved him to the bronc ride, you know, heck he never even ever got bucked in the bronc riding until he was probably, you know, seven years old, you know, so we're so eight years old. Maybe I can't I'd have to you know look back but but yeah, no he went to the finals again in the bronc riding. Yeah, actually, yeah, he's been as though you know, he been in the finals. I think he went man.	0.0
I wish I could remember I think he went I know he went a couple three times anyway in a bareback riding and then it only went twice in a bronx and the first year he went in the Bronx actually feeling Crawley one second and on him in The Eliminator pin that he wanted second that one round that one night and then then he went last this last night and 18, but he went and teen again, but then it came out that and was Zeke's arson and I think of zika gone anyway, and I didn't even got in flank and they jumped off I think and got to reroute a river. But but he so it came out backwards. And so it was kind of a mess that you're in 17 and then they didn't he didn't go back and this year and 18. He still box really? Well, I'm not I'm I'm not trying to say that, you know, like he's killed us really really hard. He just didn't go last year in you guys know how that goes some years. They need they need more of one kind and another and you know, this is how it goes. He just didn't get chosen last year, but he still as good as he was these this these people I'm going to mention here their long ways from you, but you probably you may you may know this the answer to what I'm going to say to correct me but to go with what you're saying Thor and some good friends of mine that live over there by you the the gays that horse is salt. They he went to the finals of bunching in the bareback riding and I'd never seen him in the bronc Ridin till this year. Did he go in the bronc riding him this year to the final? You know II could look but I don't recall seeing assault there, but I know him he's that Buckskin gilding. You're like, he's a good horse. Yeah, I don't know I could you know what I can look real quick cuz I think I have the NFR left right here in the go in the old. I remember seeing them. They took him to I think it was luck in in in the Bronx grab your maybe Amarillo and I was I had to watch that video a couple of times thinking is that the Assault that I think it is. Yeah, yeah, and and and and he's probably the same the same. Same scenario as I was talking about with Capone, you know, he's been a good bear back for a long time. But if they start covering a little ground and stuff.	0.0
Oh, yeah, he went to the end of our here. He is right here on the list.	1.0
He and three Bells went from rafter G. But yeah, so yeah sometime later on in life.	1.0
They just got it. I started covering too much ground and not doing doing things right. We got to move them and that's just that's that's good night about the bucking horses compared to the Bulls is	0.0
You can do things with him to kind of keep him bucking like like that. You know, if the bareback rider they're not showing you what you need to see you. You still got the bronc riding, you know in the bull rule if the Bulls quit, you know, where do you go from there? You know, that is that's something that maybe some people listening. They may not know a difference to in the horse deal you guys Buck your mayor's as well as your studs and galvan's verses in the bull deal. It's only the Bulls. Well, absolutely. Yeah in fact T' are our best horses are mares. I mean, there's good. I guess I could I don't have numbers in front of me. But I would say the biggest percentage of our heard that's of the higher-end horses are the mayor's you know, and you guys can book them heavy bread too, right? Yes. Absolutely. You know, you don't want to Buck him right up to the end. But but like a good example of For a how our system earlier in the conversation I mentioned how I learned a lot from Ike's Anki and one of the things that I learned from Mike was with breeding young mares and then breeding your business. Let's face it guys. It's if you don't breed your best mares, you're not going to have good Colts. You're gonna have mediocre cult. So you gotta break your best married.	0.0
Well, so how long does that take them out of the Arena?	1.0
Well, so are the way our schedule works is, you know, obviously if Some of the NFR then we don't do anything until the end of March as far as rodeos are concerned. I don't go to Texas or anything like that. I just use a stay home and Buchholz and do that kind of thing for how my program works is I will I turn to start out March 1st. I leave I leave our studs out for 45 days to 60 days depending on you know, how the weather you know, like I If there's like a feel like they've got two good Cycles. in then then that's when I pull them if if I don't feel like that then in I just I anyway I just want to make sure that I get them covered and I try and do it within two months if I miss if the stud Miss isn't there, I just absorb it and I don't worry about it because I don't need Colts too late because again, it could screw your deal, but I messed up my schedule because I booked the mirrors that I breed and and how I do it is so A good example is like wild and blue and tnf are just a couple of months ago or three months ago, whatever it's been now and she had a cult couple days ago some so she you know, so the turnaround time is so she's bucking the pmf are you know, eight and a half nine months bread. But then she'll she you know has these this winter off. She has her Colton case. I live in California. It's pretty nice where we live it's cold right now, but for the most part it's not too bad in the winters. She'll have she'll have, you know have her cult usually and February or 1st of March and then I will only leave the Colts with the mayor's from Fort same deal as the as the breeding cycle 45 to 60 days and then I and I ween them called too young and I A month as much hay as they'd like as much like they have free choice Alfalfa and then I feed them grain and cast Mana to get them going and and it does two things. It gets my mayor back on the road so I can get a rodeo on again. But it also makes you cold it's good to be around and pretty gentle. So, you know, they come they come to feed and and and they get used to being around people. So they're not they're not real wild went for later on and and then they don't get a little go ahead you obviously they get free choice Alfalfa and good feed but you don't have a problem with them growing just like from not being with her mom. Actually we've done it we've done a test because you've had I've had that question happen a lot and I've actually had the cult that Our on on hey and calf man and grain outperform the Colts that are on the mayor still I'll be done. Yeah, and and I think that's because we don't know how much milka mares producing you think, you know, but you don't know how much the calls getting and and so, you know, it's no different than the cow-calf deal the cow-calf guys, you know, you'll have Pals that always bring in a calf at a great wing and wait and then you got not count bring in a calf with a very good weaning weight. So you just can the cow or whatever they do and get a different cow. Well, it's not that way in the Bucking Horse World where you don't just because America doesn't produce good milk. That doesn't mean we don't want to keep raising cold side where we just going to find a different way to take care of that baby and get big and strong because you know, the maternal ability might not be there on that matter, but the Bucks in them, right? So we got to kind of and going back to what we were talking about earlier this Rocking horse deal isn't like the Bulls deal. You know, it's it's a lot harder. I mean that they just they're so there to get a really shiny bucking horse. It takes a lot of lot of breeding and and a lot of luck and a lot of work. We're in the bull deal. I don't I don't want to discredit the bull deal because it's and say that it's easy. I don't mean it like that because it's hard as well because you only get like half your cash crop, but at the same time You can go and and you know breed Mudslinger to a Houdini daughter and you're gonna have a pretty good chance of a cast that box. I mean pretty good chance, you know, sorry.	0.0
Do you say someth or oh, I just think I think you're absolutely right, but it's I think it's a lot like the horse deal every day more and more. We're bucking females. And and I think you're right. I think you could breed, you know some Superstar stuff and have a pretty good shot, but I think	1.0
So they're pregnant for 11 months 11 days. Wow.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
So so you're about a year out usually, you know, if and then and that's if that if you know if the stud gets her right away when you turn him in, you know, so and and you know, it is I don't know so that but I like like I said II usually March 1st is when I turned them studs out and out here in For Nia and it's always generally speaking. It's pretty nice. And and the you know, we don't know how that the sunshine in the weather and the warmth and all those things gets gets gets the mayor cycling better and and then so if everything goes right, usually I can use they start getting those mares breads are the first week or two of March and then that you know that gets me the February babies that I'm after so and then after they have their faults, how long is it until you can put them back on there? Well, so generally speaking Yeah, 45 to 60 days. All we know is cult and put them on.	1.0
Like I said the full feed deal then then but in the matter of a couple of weeks to recover to you know, you got they got to dry up and then they and then you gotta kind of exercise going to get them in shape a little bit to you can't you can't just you don't want to just take them in there with you know with a big bag full of milk. They'll be you. Do that to him. You gotta let him dry up. Like I said and get their belly kind of shrunk back into shape and just kind of get them back into shape. And you know, it'd be no different than your saddle horse you if you need to get some work done on your saddle horse. You don't just let him stand out six months and then just go get on pounding back into very good. He'll probably just tie up on you, you know, so so a couple couple more horse questions for we dabble in the	0.0
The bull side of things for you guys. How many how many murders do you you guys breed a year?	0.0
We usually exposed what we've been doing lately. We used to expose 25 to 30 of them depending on you know, a couple of things just how well I like the young men remember a little bit ago. I talked about exposing young fillies, you know for three four year old Phillies. Well, depending Come on, how many I want to put in those into the system for you get a cold out of so but to answer your question directly. Yeah, 25 to 30 of them. And then generally that means that you'll get you know, they'll they'll be a few measures that don't get bread. So you'll I usually shoot to have 20 calls a year at least 20, you know 22 you'll end up with so if you exposed 30 mares, ideally you'd get 30 calls, but generally speaking you're going to get 25 or 26 right in that area and then and then same same deal as finally read exposed 25 meters. It's more like, you know, you know right around 20 to 21 22 and then there's been years like I Beretta I studied calvary's a couple years ago. Tiger Warrior actually, he's are really really great blocker and really bread well and when we breath tiger Warrior, I put him with 20 mares because that was the deal we made. Made with those guys and heck. I think I only ended up with 13 goals. And that was it that wasn't tiger Warriors fault or anybody's fault. It was just one of those things where that was year was real wet and rainy and and not lost sunshine and the mayor's didn't circled. I'm sorry didn't cycle that well, and and so it wasn't all his fault. It was just one of those things that have Mother Nature. Yeah, exactly. And in fact, I when I talk to our vet around home here, and he said he was having trouble. Even getting like the cut and horses and reining horses in the people in the with the saddle horses around he was trying to having hell getting a the mayor's ovulate for him, you know, so it was just one of those Springs. It was just a tough.	0.0
It's crazy. You say that I pray break. Some cows has this winter and my vet when he called them, you know, he dragged him and then afterwards he said, you know, it's funny. We've Craig thousand cows this year and there was they were either shortbread or long bread. But but the way he was saying it was They didn't they weren't breeding in a certain 45-day window from all over the area. You know, dude Mother Nature like you're talking right?	1.0
Exactly and I think we can all see that mother nature is more powerful and strong more strong than any of us, you know, you'd allowed and I love hunting and I hunt a lot in the Northwest is if I can and if we have time and you'll see that on certain years when we go elk hunting you'll look in the the cow elk. Have a lot of calves on them and it looks like everything's good. Not the populations good and then the next year, you're like, oh boy. This doesn't look good. I hardly see any cabs and and this and that and I of course there's a there's a whole host of reasons for that. You know, you got the Predators and all that jazz, but then probably some of it is the is the mother. Yeah how well they got bread back by the Bulls, you know, so yeah. Yeah. Yeah a lot of variables that play into it.	0.0
So before we switch over to the Bulls, what was It's off the top of your head some horses. You guys have taken to the finals back in when you took over and o5 O 6 2 2 now like some of the famous ones you mean that that we've taken. Yeah.	1.0
Okay, so well, probably one of the most famous horses we take in the finals is is sock. Dancer Moulin Rouge sock answer, you know, we've sold this in them in the meantime while I start we started taking him. Think o 506 taught that that period of time and took him to the finals a few times 1 branca the NFR and it's the ear. He the year he won that actually I sold him to stay Smith and that you know, Moulin Rouge was a real famous horse. We took now beaver fever. She went for hacks you went from all five till last year and then we retired her beaver beaver fever with a heck of a good horse for us. And then and then in fact one of her sons went to the finals last year be verb and he went to in a foreigner bronc riding and then all raggedy Anne Capone.	1.0
What's the what's the gray mare?	1.0
Wild and blue? Yeah. Yeah. She's been every year since so I actually bought her from the guy here and right here outside of town a friend of mine named Chuck Norris. He raised he raised his bucking horses and does some high school college and it's Amateur rodeos and has a brief program himself and and I actually bought two members from him and I'm kind of think that year. I bought those murder. I'm gonna say I think I bought those mares from him and like, oh, wait right in there and and I bought wild and blue who herself, you know bucks bucks. Obviously really? Well, she'd been to the NF are all these years and then there was another mare that came with her and her name was His Indian summer. Well Indian summer, she's just an okay Bronk. But remember when I was talking about that consistency of being really solid she oh one of those kind she's solid. She's like a 1920 pointer every time and she her oldest cult I have is a bronc named Indian burn and I took him we've taken him to the finals the last two years. He went as a four-year-old and five-year-old. So and And I know you're playing with fire taking a four-year-old to the National Finals. But but he's just that good and anyway, so that that purchase worked out pretty good for us by an electric bears from Chuck. So, you know, we got a boy, you know a really good mare that produces Colton and one that bucks really well herself. So yeah, that's about what they sometimes it hits like that. Now I've got other stories I could tell you that didn't hit very good that one did so so kind of transition into the to the Bulls	1.0
Side of things you guys I'm taking it you don't you don't raise any you buy crack?	0.0
Right? So again, like I told you earlier when I first came around went to work for Dawn Kish and and sure if anybody anybody knows anything about bucking bulls and those who've gone to issues and knows what he did for a lot of years and and So I worked around that outfit for a long time and you know, I learned a lot about bulls. I think I learned a lot about bubbles in it and with around a lot of bowls and a lot of cows and lot of All That Jazz. And there was a time when like in the late 90s when I first went around there and early 2000s when if you wanted really good Bulls you need to raise them. I mean, I think everybody would I think you'd be naive to say that in that period of time you needed to raise the goal is to get the kind you wanted that were that were beyond what everybody else had but as we all know through the last 15 years, it's changed, you know, the You know heck there's there's people showing up to those a BBI events that nobody's ever heard of that just flush the cow and put it with this did that and have a mother and had a really good bull, you know, I mean II am not and when I say really good, but I'm not talking about bushwhacker. I'm just saying they have both it turned back in the gate bucket or you know, 22-point Bull and it's somebody that's not really a bull person. They've just bred that way and and and not to try and get and I don't Mean it like this discredit people like they don't know what they're doing. I'm not saying that what I'm saying is it would be no different than me and going and Bryant buying a cutting horse out of highbrow cat and some fancy mayor, you know, I the Bloods there it's in them. So if you know, if you don't as long as you don't mess him up, you know, the Bulls are available and so forth for through just the supply and demand of the rodeo the kind of bulls we Rodeo with week, you know, you guys all know that we don't need both like, you know Long John rodeo with or frozen or whatever, you know, you don't need those but we just need you know, you just need good Bulls to turn back and guy can be 85 or better on and and and so for us what works when my wife Haley and I started Bridwell pro rodeo, you know and and here a couple of years ago. We just found for us. It was more cost effective just to buy the boats, you know with with raising them and that I just don't have the feed for him don't have enough country out here in California Every Little Bit of Country. I get I have to put the horses on because I can't afford to buy the high-end horses, but I can I can I can buy, you know, I have to raise those but I could I can match around and they're really good Bulls, you know, just for free.	1.0
Double amount of money. Yeah, like you said the supply and demand you can you can find there's a lot more people raising bucking bulls and good buffing floors in there is horses and then people damn near want to give them Wolves Away, you know, it seems like well here I'll give you an example and I'm guys I'm not an arrogant guy.	0.0
So don't think it'll take a like I'm bragging. I'm just trying to say how it works for us financially and up it to be efficient. I bought a bull at the NFR sell two years ago, but we call him 100x helmets Boot Hill. Well, I guess 3500 for him at the NFR sell two years ago taking him to the National Finals twice and the other day at Sacramento PBR. They are Vieira was 89 on them want to short go on him, you know, and I know that that doesn't always work out like that. I'm not being trying to be naive either that that it always works out like that but like him or the bull jive turkey that they the other Brazilian boy rows are in the short goat Sacramento. I bought Josh Last year at the enough ourselves. I give 6,000 for him. He come from Toby Floyd and and that and he was like $89 88-89 on him a guy can put by a really damn good bull anymore.	1.0
Four five six thousand bucks. Well, yeah for that you have to raise that ball.	1.0
They had to raise five other ones. That's that's all I'm saying. It doesn't work for us.	0.0
I seen some videos. As following your guys's social media and stuff that that jive turkeys. I've been a fan of jive turkey style. I was questioning why he didn't go and finals last year Oh you mean the NFR? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, he did know he did. He did go. Okay. Yeah, he did go.	1.0
Yeah, jive turkey went and and then I so we took him and we took who's bad news. He's another bill that came out of that sale.	1.0
I had to give a little bit of Jack for him though because there was a couple other guys that like him too, but All that was visible that Jamie was that win long the lot one in Long rounds on right? Yes, sir. Yeah, that's yeah, that's who's bad news. Yeah, and there was a there was a white boy. I think you took or maybe he had been before on the rights kind of move away from them guys a little bit. All right, come out Omaha the big bull. Yeah Omaha.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
So the other day, I'm at Sacramento muhittin hip and kind of making shoot forward and had a little bit of a different day that bull usually right there to the right. You like he'll go like a round or two right there to the right in the gate and then he'll jump forward and go back a left generally, but the other day, like I said, he hit he hit his hip and made him shoot forward and then he kind of had a kind of a I don't know. I didn't love these is move before I turn back. But once you turn back then he was fine. But yeah that hit so that will Omaha. I like him. He's a good boy, but he came from a friend of ours up in Oregon a guy named Rusty Gorham raised that boy. So the in their sure proud of them Rusty and Lisa are real proud of that bull. So that's cool. Cool for that deal back here. $3,500 will 10 Bingham was like 93 on them at Kennewick or something. Wasn't he? Right? Yeah. Yeah at Puyallup at the yeah. Yeah, and then his brother Tyler at Spring Road. The only time that Bulls been rode the last couple of years. Other than that the PBR deal, but Tyler Kimball throat. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Hi, you know good good good boy, the 93 I think was a stretch that was quite a bit of points. But but but he's a good-good bull and in back to our point is for for what works for our business and and I'm not saying that works for everybody. But for what we're doing it, it works better for us just to buy the both, you know, so I can see the guys that raise them like the pages I watched. They're Bulls at Sacramento. Watch what they do on the sales. And if not and how they do their their their business and I can see why they do what they do. It works. They block like hell and they sell it for lots of money. So they're doing they do you know what works for them? That's good for exactly. What so what about to you can kind of answer this in the two-part question but like us fraternity guys and stuff what kind of segregate our bulls and stuff and then I take it rodeoing, you know, it's um rodeos may have ample amounts of pain some may not Are they are they just in general population like at your house? And then how many how many trips a year roughly. We you put on a bull? Well, the first the first part of your question is is you nailed it. There's there's a lot there's rodeos have the facility that to split them up pretty good. But then there's a lot of a lot of rodeos at don't have that, you know the kind of facilities. You need to split them up a whole bunch. I'll tell you how I try and make them live. And and you guys being bull guide, you know that there's sometimes you just can't make mixes. There's some mixes that just don't work. They just don't like each other. We know we all know that kind of force them through it and get them to get along but for us how I try and do it as I pay them how they fit on a truck. So in a cattle pot sets of 6 is I got using I got a couple sets of fours or like a set of for a set of three got to be the nose and the back step and then sets Six is on the top, you know the top and the bottom decks. So and then that also fit for the pins that we have in our house, you know, we have pins that are about all half acre lots maybe from half an acre to maybe one acre lot and and that's plenty of room for them.	1.0
So they don't make it too muddy or or whatever, you know 7f room doing the first part doing doing it that way to with you guys.	1.0
Bye. Bulls you can you can at least find find somewhere where they'll get along and don't just have to put them all together. All right. Yeah. Well and I try not to mix too much with young and old that's the other thing you guys probably the same thing is if he generally when they're young and Too Young or whatever young and old this doesn't work. I try and mix bulls that are kind of in the same kind of age bracket. Not not too much because II If you get too many youngsters In Their Own Zone, you know how many Smart Ones they're all just thousands of goofy. But then at the same time I try and just do it that way. I'm not saying, you know, and I don't know there's there's mixes that you're thinking it's all right. This is a perfect mix or getting along great and then one day the fight breaks out your welcoming six and you know, we all know that that program but So that's how I how I have my set and then the sixes or so, but and then the second part of your question, I already forgot. What were the how many trips you you put on the moles a year? So, you know, we have 20 rodeos and and that includes some bull rides and stuff. So not as we all know not every bull goes to every event but generally when they go they got they get back twice, so probably around, you know, 15 to We find out it's probably early and and but remember our our season doesn't start till the end of March and it's over, you know, probably around middle of October. So we kind of so strip for pretty consecutive. It's not like we you know, you know, it's spread throughout the 12 months. We only Rodeo for about seven months out of the year. And I mean excluding you like the NFR and that kind of thing, you know, but you only take such a hit small. There, you know a handful of them on speaking in terms of the whole herd not just hand out of them, you know, so yeah with with that being said have you I mean being that you know, and I think if I'm not mistaken and maybe it's changed now, but some of the rodeos out there California and stuff they may only have rights or buying buying bulls. Have you figured that some Bulls just can't take that whereas, you know, Omaha and and Boot Hill and bad news they can take That right? Yeah, so I actually most of the bulls that you're right some of the that is one thing I've learned about the bull deal that I I did not know before is I didn't realize how important in this sounds really silly and kind of naive but I didn't realize how important the the deliveries were on on the Bulls until the last few years before I you know, I always kind of treat them like horses are pretty good about you know, they kind of take a scoot out of there and they go pretty straight for a while before they start into their Circle. Usually well with the bulls as we all know if a bull Curtis back right gate, he he's so wired and program to do that right there if the gates in his way or if everything it's hard for him that change it up if they've if they've done it done it very long a good example is is so I have a good buddy in the Northwest and you guys know him and my Quarry he has a bull call Cowabunga and so Years ago we were going Cowabunga is always out of the left and we decided he Mike's bringing the reading and reading rodeos. All right. Well, we might thought well heck we'll try and figure out how to get Cowabunga out of the the right. So we were going to we're going to running through this dry if running through and making turn out of there out of the right. We hiding tailed just dry. Nobody even there now we can it was all we could do to make that simple sucker turnout. Out of there to the right. He just wouldn't get one do it just like is the only thing that has to be spraying or something. I don't know that goofy little pot liquor. We couldn't hardly get him to turn out of that properly and finally, II think what we finally ended up doing is running around running around in and doing it until he finally kind of went out there but it kind of ran down the gate even dry. Anyway, we tried to Buck him and it didn't work and gave her a ride and all that. So going back to my original point the it's if if they've if they've been out of one delivery very long. It it's so programmed in their mind. So for me, it's been hard to switch him. But I just try and change it up when they're young, you know before when I see like when I buy up a little if you know we get to a place is only has rights and and hopefully the Bulls young enough. I see I just start changing them up right away and and make them, you know learn to do it that way now. Obviously, I have some that don't don't don't ever change like jive turkey you were talking about him and Was too a while ago, you know, he's right there to the left. He's never been out of any other delivery and he's really good. So why would I mess with it?	1.0
So when there's the rodeos where they only have right hand shoots Well, Jack turkey doesn't go, you know, you know, that's just a way that's got to be, you know, he and I only got a couple bulls that way but you know, he once they get to where they're pretty shiny in there and they're that good you don't really want to mess him up.	0.0
Do you are you gonna are you gonna start going to some pbrs and stuff while you're slowly while you're slow time off rodeoing?	1.0
Well, I wouldn't say no, but I wouldn't say yes. I mean, let's face it. They're like I said the other day when we went to Sacramento it was it would like that those Bulls Bach like hell, I'm okay. And so and so when when Whenever whenever you put your Bulls up against those guys, it really lets you know, what and for me I eat it's not that it's not something I don't have investors and I don't have partners and you know, that's the only partner I have my wife and she's not very loaded so so happy so we don't for the PBR deals just different. I'm and I enjoy doing it because it's something to do. In the wintertime and and and I and I like Cody Lambert and we like Riley. We do do some other stuff with them at the American and that and their friends and that and and you know, like I said the pages and then you got new guys coming in all the time with there was some new contractors there that are pretty aggressive on putting bowls together. It did you have it's not something it's not something I can compete with, you know by looking at it though.	0.0
You heck your bullshit in just fine.	1.0
But remember that's one time that one time one event next week after week after week, and maybe they are maybe and I'm sure there's a couple dimples that would do it week after week after week. But but for for us, it's not something that work all the way. I'm gonna completely focus on because we have a lot of rodeos and we have a lot of good committees and a lot of people that we do business with that. We that we enjoy, you know, enjoy as well, you know, and we have to have a good set of both for our rodeos. Not just our horses, you know, we we all those committees at a service that's good throughout good quality throughout that's something that we really pride ourselves in here with our rodeo company is We're not yet. I don't want to ever be just label the horse guy or just a bull guy or a guy that has mediocre rough stock and great time today. We try and be full service. We want the best pickup man. The best bullfighter we can get the best book Bronx bareback and Bulls and and even time to be in cattle. We want to be good at it all. You know that I something that that I wouldn't when we first started this one of the one of the guys that I've Has looked up to that I've always thought had excellent stock throughout was Sammy Andrews Sam. He's always had good bulls and good horses. He wasn't just a bull guy or just a horse guy. It's so and that for me. That's not my want to pride myself in this being a Stockman not just one one one sided because at the end of the day those guys paid their entry fees to they need they deserve a decent shot, you know, so he's so leading into the to the 2019 season.	1.0
You got a couple couple points here. Is there any any Young Horses you're going to crack out or many bulls. You just bought your kind of excited about.	1.0
Um, well, yeah, so we haven't bought any any Bulls right right this minute that are that are really fancy. I mean, I got some calves that I bought from a guy that from ask from a neighbor that are look really good with the dummy and and have got a couple Rider trips on that look like they might Might be really good but I don't want to brag on them yet because they just pretty green. But what are those who you lines? Sorry. What are they two year olds? And you said they had a couple of ridership for the three year olds their fields? And and then then I have I do have a horse coming on a young horse that I call white-hot. He is a solid white horse and he's actually out of that gray mare we were talking about earlier. While Blue well, I got has only had a couple of Rider trips on him, but he won second at Bob Marriott's dirty rotten buckers bucking horse fraternity last summer he one second. I think it was in the bareback ride. Anyway, he looks pretty good. I think that horse he'll be he'll he'll be 5 this year so he got a little more age on him and then some of them because he was just a little bit of a late bloomer, but he bucks pretty Dang good and and I saw I think that that'll be a up-and-coming star for us this summer moving forward in and there's a there's a couple of other Colts that are that are coming on. I mentioned that Indian burn in that Indian summer line of horses. There's a little brother to Indian burn coming out and he's a a sista numbers 505. He's just a, you know going to be a four year old black yelling and he box Really good. He didn't even have a name yet. I need to come up with a name for it.	1.0
But anyway, yeah, so yeah, so that with rodeos I I don't fight Bulls anymore. But probably one of my fondest rodeos ever been to was Salinas. Oh, yeah. She's in the bullfights are think five five times. But yeah, I that was that's probably the coolest Romeo been through I like the heck out at Rodeo in the history and the Heritage behind	1.0
Well, absolutely. Yeah, I did so and that's the thing I and I'm glad you missed that. That's the thing that's different out here that from like the Midwest rodeos or the text rodeos or whatever out here when you know, you'll heal you will be talking to different contractors are committeeman and stuff like that out here on the West Coast like some of our rodeos go three and four hours long and they're like how the hell do you have a rodeo this three or four hours long? Well, it's out here. It's more of a celebration. It's like all days he'll you know, And then and everybody's just hanging around all day and used to call those we used to call those cotton carnivals. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's got me kind of I don't know. It's kind of like a celebration kind of I don't know if it has something to do like talking about Salinas, you know, the the Fiesta Mexican heritage Salinas rodale, you know, and just how the heritage is of it's a celebration more than just a two-hour rodeo in a few know and and you know my life she you know, everybody knows Haley she When she when she moved out moved out here and we started in started, you know going to the Royals but with me and you know, she had been out here a lot before as well, but before that but Morgan involved in the production and stuff like that, it was a it was a kind of a culture shock even for her being someone that did in the rodeo business. So for a lot of years to her dad and stuff and And then you know, they were raised under that Jerome Robby Robinson kind of Steel was it was it go into a building? It's a two-hour show, you know kind of almost like a concert you just went in and blew it out and it's not but they didn't when coming out here on the West Coast. It's like they're the committee's and then the celebration is idea behind it. Is it tell us you can keep him there for four hours at the beers. Can you make more money? So that's kind of a different way of doing it.	1.0
Same idea just a different different way, you know, so and that is the rodeos out there freaking me and a buddy. We'll talk another day because some some of the first rodeos were out there and I mean, they're huge like you say keep them there for four hours. Like we're not talking about two or three hundred people talking about five or six seven thousand people.	1.0
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Hell have you guys been to Pendleton?	1.0
I've not that's not one.	0.0
I've been to I never get done you've been there. For six hours, but time you get there a little bit early and you watch and they have the Indian relay. They have the Indian relay races and I mean it in a policy say the way when I say your be there for six hours. I mean, it's six hours of fun. But time you go to The Letter Buck room and you go to the when you go to the rodeo starts and they have like I said the Indian relay races The Wild Cow Milking and they Buck, you know, 20 whore 20 bare backs 20 Bronx a bunch of bulls have did they have you know, there's just a whole bunch of Stuff and and and it's awesome. It's just so I guess what a person has to really be cognitive of is that it's not always about this. Like it's there rodeos aren't just Stamped Out of a cookie cutter everybody and every Rodeo has a different, you know different way of marketing their deal and that's what I think is pretty really pretty cool about the West Coast rodeos in particular. Is that whether you're at Salinas with the bullfights and what's going on and the California rodale and then you go to the Pendleton with the with the Native American You know history involved in the Tepee Village and all that all all even over to Joseph Organ, you know where that you know Chief Joseph days. I really felt celebrate the best Perce tribe and all that's going on. It's just a lot a lot of different things that play into how they Market their rodeos and how they do their thing is and each each one's different a little bit but really kind of there's a lot a lot to to see in a lot to check out. It's really cool. I think. So, like I said, it's not there not just Stamped Out of a cookie cutter there. It's there's just each one's a little bit different and I like it.	1.0
Thank ya wealth or you got anything.	1.0
A question that I wanted to know and I think it's probably going to be different for every Rodeo guy. But what you said you buy most of your Bulls are all of them what you just bought some seen some dummy trips on what are you looking for? I mean, you know, you're not you're not competing with them. It doesn't sound like so what's the few quality traits that you really looking for in a good one? Well well Oh guys look at the air and kick and spin but then for for me that that I guess that's I like speed. I you know might Corey and I always round and round about this because you know, I like I said a little bit ago Mike Corey and I are good buddies and bikes been at Northwest bull man for years and and he's in the break over Bulls. He likes bulls that that break over and old knock your job. You don't hang around you've been hanging around on kiss so long, you got the same flavor. He does with the speed a little bit when they have that intensity and speed all I know I like him to kick. I'm not gonna happen. But you know, but you do look at you do look at this. That X does a lot. You know, there's a lot of guys that even in this day and age they don't care how they read.	1.0
They just want to see him but you know, well well, so, how come how come for me that I look at genetic number one is I feel like its genetic if they got a good kinetics there. They have a lot better chance is hanging in there. If if you get them a little tired and burn them out a little bit tinkerability Yeah, if if you freshen them back up, they'll come back for you.	1.0
Yeah, the other side of that is is it is when I'm done with them they got value as far as if somebody, you know wants a breeding bull.	1.0
I got some sun, you know some some some genetic ability here that I don't have to just take my old bull the sale barn I can taking you know and selling the somebody that's raising them and get some good out of the old boy, you know, so and and have a cross that bridge yet because you know, but I just look for it that way, you know, so do	1.0
Have a flavor then that when you were young or when you were riding bulls you like, you know, this was your favorite Bull and you kind of maybe it'll make it a little better deal.	1.0
If you happen to buy a bull that was you know, the similar genetic line do you have well, I you know, I it's not so much about when I'm riding bulls as much as you know, like I said, I like the speedballs because I grew up around them. But then for me now I like going back to any Anything that that's related to page blood and that's just because of value, you know, we were talking about jive turkey while ago again, he comes up and Toby Floyd rays that go but he's out of a page bull. I don't know what I that's messing about that. I think yeah. Okay. So whatever that is, I don't know but you bull guys know what he is.	1.0
That's that's that's good, you know, and that's I just know that if he's out of a page bull and a good cow. When he's done, somebody probably gonna want him, you know, so Not only was he bred well, but if he has a good career that you know that you could look and Bowl, you know, so that that's kind of what I look at.	1.0
That's that's interesting to see to hear that side of it as far as you're looking at the after math because a lot of guys that are providing a breed bullet actually agreed to I mean, they they want to build it's been to the finals and read good and it was going to help that resale value probably quite a bit.	1.0
Oh, absolutely, you know performance and you know, what's the three p's Prodigy performance and pedigree? And so that that's you know, that's that's the three the three Deals in the whatever it is the beef business everybody looks at those and I look at it kind of the same way in the in the bucket Bowl deal. You know, you gotta gotta have those ingredients. Obviously. We you can't have Prodigy if you've never read them, but You know, that's the third leg of that if if that you know, somebody does cross that bridge will then and breeds one of them both. Well, that's great.	1.0
You know, thank you Tim. Is there anything we're kind of near the end here anything you want to add?	1.0
Oh, yeah. No, just I want to say thanks to you guys for having me on appreciate it and I want to want to anything that grows the Western way of life and and if my thoughts and our business. What you know can add to that and add to the rodeo business and make it better. That's what we're here for. You know, it's a something we grew up around and something we've always loved my wife and I and our all our kids we want to we want things to go good and go directional the time for everybody and and certainly thankful to be a part of it.	1.0

I was young little bit cocky. I guess you could say because I'm this things. I look back on like I remember sitting and Kevin Liles office and he heard a demo we had And he was like I oh I'll put you in the studio with Primo and y'all do for joints and my dumb ass goes now my man need to do to beat it.	1.0
Just so people can understand what he just said is he turned down working with DJ Premier? That is who Primo is for his man's whose man's baby my man, but what I'm a loyal do, okay, I'm a loyal dudes.	1.0
I was like yo at the time we was Can we my man doing the tracks this of course Primo the legend now, I look back on this kick myself in the ass.	0.0
There are some actors that you feel like you personally know because they play roles that remind you of folks in your family and your neighborhood or people you went to school with. So in 1999 the movie The Wood came out and it really is one of the most underrated movies because what made that movie special. Is while it was based in Inglewood those characters could have been coming of age and Detroit Chicago really anywhere now Omar Epps my guest today on Jamel Hills and I'm bothered has been in a few movies that are just like that from Jews to Love & Basketball, even the program he has had an incredible career that has spanned some years. He joins me today to discuss not just his career, but the book he wrote about black fatherhood his days as a former MC in case y'all didn't know he used to spend on the mic and Why we've never seen him and Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin in the same room now, but all jokes aside. Very pleased to welcome Omar Epps. He's up next. Because I'm such a gracious host especially to guess whose work. I've admired for a while and you know people who I get the sense even though Omar you and I don't know each other that well, but you know, I fuck with you, right? So because of that, of course, I'm gonna open with something that I'm sure you have a lot of thoughts and opinions that plays right to your strength. Let's talk about your damn Cowboys. Ha ha ha. Wow. I know what a what an opener. Yeah, like real Graces of me to like bring up something. I'm sure right now for Cowboys versus everybody is a sore subject. So where do you stand on Jason Garrett? Because a lot of is to some degree typical after a loss that people immediately direct all their anger and frustration at the coach. So that's kind of common but with Jason Garrett is just has always felt as if there's been this love-hate relationship between him and Cowboys fans who are expecting more you always expect more but in particular this year, so what's your assessment of?	1.0
Jason Garrett, it sucks. I'm 50/50. I've always been 5050 with Garrett because you know, I'm a big believer like, you know team sort of take on the attitude of their head coaches, right and and you just has that sort of feeling Jason Garrett now don't he's one of the nicest human beings.	1.0
So if you had a chance to meet a minimum, he's just a nice guy, you know what I mean?	1.0
And so there's a part of you that roots for a person like that, but the sports fan in me, you know, I've been saying this for five years. I want Bill Cowher To be our coach with the pieces that we have if Bill Cowher was a head coach I would it would be over the moon. Okay, but we're going to see it's 50/50. Look it's you know how this change his day-to-day if we end up making a run in the playoffs if we end up in the NFC Championship all of a sudden a Garrison draws forgotten.	1.0
You know what I mean? Yeah All Is Forgiven us.	1.0
We don't make the playoffs this year.	0.0
You gotta go, you know, what would be a perfect scenario especially for you is if the Steelers fire Mike Tomlin and then he coaches the Cowboys so then everybody can see you guys in the same place, right and no dispel the room and dispel the rumor that you're literally the same person.	1.0
I'm sure when people started saying that I mean, do you actually see the resemblance or you just like nah, at first I didn't and I'm like, I guess when I grow my beard out I was like, okay we look he can look like my older brother's wife Lisa. I was like, what do you think? She was like a little bit, right? Okay, so you can you can take it they say we all have a doppelganger somewhere in the universe.	1.0
We will know that I guess if there's ever a movie made about my childhood you probably going to be the first guy I would assume so that they call so Alicante is just to do everything. Let's go back to Brooklyn for a bit. You know, as you mentioned you all the New York teams. They were not very good. So, you know, you kind of wound up gravitating toward the Cowboys. In terms of you catching the acting bug.	0.0
How did that come about that came about so my grandfather got arrested. So he was a jazz musician. My grandmother was like a jazz singer like photographer just artsy and you know growing up. I thought I was going to play football and I got hit real hard and I was like, huh? Maybe I can act like a football. But yeah, you know, I've always been into the Arts. I've been writing for as long as I can remember. Are you should dabble with music and the first, you know doing the school play like anybody else and that's when I got bit you did I did we did the play grease? Oh, oh, okay, but then you know, I was I kind of got it really acting became an extension of writing because I've been writing poetry and short stories and all that stuff and you know, when it came time to go to school. I was like, I'm going to audition a performing arts high school and really see what it is, and I hadn't really done. I hadn't done. Any acting classes and you know other than regular public school stuff and I auditioned for vocal and acting and I got in and then that was it after that because this you know, so it's an incredible performing arts school. I mean in the country and just the faculty and just the way that they treat the art itself and the crafted just really I felt like I had found my purpose I'm gonna guess that you probably didn't Maybe	1.0
A whole lot of people pursuing that kind of career pursuing that kind of passion. So, you know, what did like your people your friends? What did they think about the fact that you wanted to pursue something? That's kind of non-traditional even though you're in New York.	1.0
You know, it's funny about that is nobody really knew I really didn't I mean my mom knew but it was just my peers in school. Like I still have my boys on the Block and he's just like, you know go to performing arts and I was just quiet with my wall and then you know, I had my boy Boys that I grew up with that we went we all went to the same High School my boy mom and my boy Mitch so we shared that thing and and I mean it for me it happened pretty quickly. Exactly. Yeah. I got out of high school a book juice and that's when he was like, oh like you really like trying to do his acting thing and I was like, yeah, but um, you know, I've been I've been blessed ever since. So how did you book juice juice was what they call a cattle call. So I so I you know, Got out of school and I was one of those and take a year off get a job kind of figure out, you know, I didn't I didn't know if I want to go straight to college one of my boys went to how and I was just like I'm gonna kick it around in the city audition heard about this audition went and it was like, I don't know how it seemed like it was like a thousand people there go in read they called me back read again. It was like every call back. It was a smaller group and it was a lot of chi don't remember how many callbacks but I wouldn't be surprised if he was something like 15 called like something out there and then there was like there was like eight of us that they were kind of like trying to put will you to read this role and you read that role and then they had a dinner and I remember my manager at the time she was like, you know, they really hot on this guy 2-pack 2-pack shocker and I was like what you just like whatever you do try to sit next to that guy because they really love love that. And of course as it would play out we sat on opposite ends of the table, you know what I mean, but after we had this dinner and everybody just vibed out and about couple days later. I got a call from Ernest Dickerson. He said hey man got some good news. Looks like you got the part and I was like really and was like it. I'll never forget that moment for the rest of my life.	1.0
Now. They they had you you just said that they had you kind of doing other roles to like like, you know, And everyone everyone everyone was there. Did you always want you or was that another part that you were also kind of drawn to his will that you would have been happy to play?	1.0
That's a good that's a good question. I think well originally I went in for Q. So that's you know, I had the blinders on for that but once they started moving us around and well you try this role. You try right hand. You try Bishop, you know, you just had to be open to the process, but I think internally, I've always felt connected to Q, you know the first time ever	1.0
Script, so well, it wasn't, you know relatively recently. I had bochum Woodbine. Okay who was on the set of juice playing the stand-in for Treach? I think that's what he did. He told a pretty funny story about his first the first time him and pot bonded was they smoke weed together? Alright, so the blood together you remember your first time like when you met him and when what was that experience like first time I met Park was at that.	1.0
At dinner, I just spoke about and who he was. No, I mean vaguely, you know, like the Digital Underground thing, but it was it was more vague. You know, we've I blew it was cool. Yeah that you know, he had that pack had that thing that some people have like when they walk into a room there's a magnetic energy that he just, you know, sort of sucks the air out of the room and then after you know, We all found out we got it and I think he was staying at Harlem at the time but his mom's and then they started bringing us in like the rehearsal process and that sort of thing. That's when we started getting cool and but Park was Park which is a one of one-of-a-kind do really really smart way more book reading people give him credit for and then you know, once we started the filming process man, we just Got tight and got cool and it was it was all New York. So, you know cats was trailers was getting ran up in and robbed and it was all type of stuff happening around the filming process because it was still old New York and no I remember going uptown with him to you know, go to his mom's crib and met her and he was a good dude, and he was told he was recording his first album at the time so I have fond memories of like in between Takes all the you know lunch break. He'd be like yo o run up being I'm run up in the trailer and he would be spitting around to me and I'm like, oh, what's that fool? And he was like, oh, I'm gonna do this song blase blase bar, and I've told her story once before but I remember with this is when I really sort of Genius apart one day we came to set and he was reading the papers and some woman had through her baby in the incinerator, right? That's a horrible thing, but sadly grown up in New York at that time. That was normal to hear like you heard stuff like that all the time and park was so affected by like it was messing with him the whole day and I'm like, oh it was like whatever and same thing happened at lunch. Call me in the trail. Yo, he starts spitting this verse and I'm not putting two and two together now months later when the first album come out and I saw Brenda's Got a Baby. I was like, oh shit, that's the joint that and it but I saw the whole process and I was like, oh, yeah, he did.	1.0
Mmm different when you guys are shooting juice of course, which went on to become a cult classic essentially. Did you have the vibe? Then didn't have the feel that this was going to be the kind of movie that would like really resonate with people, you know.	0.0
All right, so is is for me it's a 50/50 thing 50/50 in that, you know, I was 17 so I didn't know shit about nothing. Right and it's that's naive Tay that you have that when you're that young that I think protects you from the realities of the entertainment business now personally, I always thought we was making fire because of what the movie was. I was like yo, this is like our life, you know what I mean? Like I could relate so much to the film that I felt like I would go see this, you know, but then you know, this is me saying it in hindsight, but you just there's so many variables that come into you know, the filmmaking process the timing the market Yada, yada yada, but personally I always felt it was going to be fired. You know what I mean? Because I was a part of the process again. I'm on set with pot we doing this scene. We doing that scene and storylines going here going there. I thought it was dope.	1.0
Do you think juice could be remade today?	1.0
It could I think I'm going to believe in like you leave the classics alone. I think you could take like the bits and pieces of the story line and modernize it. You know, I don't know if you continue it.	0.0
I was like you can't Guys, like literally everybody's day. Yeah everybody that were the characters like they're all going.	0.0
Well you do like you do like, you know Q went on to become like a record executive and Bishop had a baby. No one knew about that. They found and he raps now, so he's signing up him here.	1.0
I don't know. They always come up with something creative. As you said like not only you know, you were enacting you always into the Arts. And music was something that you were also into now. Was that something at that time? You were pursuing at the same time?	1.0
Yeah. I had a record deal before I booked my first movie A lot of people don't know that and so it was me and my cousin we had a group called wolf pack and we were trying to get after it. But that was the gatekeeper days. That was when you couldn't I mean it didn't you know right now you can just hit send and this out to the world and it is what it is and you know, they wanted I was kind of an Ali and his sense of now there's just hit movie out and we got this kid signing with deal but he's spitting up because we was more awesome like revolutionary kind of Dead Prez type of field and it was like nah, we we need the radio and I'm like, well, that's not me. So it's just got bottleneck that that you know at that at that point and I was young too. I was young little bit cocky. I guess you could say because I've this things I look back on like I remember sitting in cash. Now's office and he heard the demo we had he was like Ayo, I'll put you in the studio with primo and y'all do for joints and my dumbass goes now my man need to do the beach.	0.0
Just so people can understand what he just said. Is he turned down working with DJ Premier? That is who Primo is okay for his man's who is man's baby.	0.0
Come on, man, but I'm loyal do okay. I'm a loyal dudes. I was like yo at the time we was rocking with my man doing the tracks this of course Primo's a legend now. I look back on this kick myself in the ass all the time. But at the time, you know, I was just being loyal.	0.0
My peoples yeah, but you know, I was surprised to see your man is if he was for real he to be like you know, what I appreciate the Loyalty but you enjoy.	1.0
Yeah, exactly.	1.0
I wish you told me that too now because we do our research here now, you know, we do have a clip of you rapping, right? All right, it's what you want a wolf pack. We're gonna play your verse right now. Remember that verse and you remember that whole yeah, I remember that time.	1.0
Yeah, that was a that was a crazy. I was a crazy night because it was a battle. We battle like for duels at night. I think I was like, I think I got caught out there that night. I won one and I got cold out there for the other but this is all while he was filming a video.	1.0
Oh, so you made the decision to not pursue, you know music not in the same way that you pursued, you know acting but how many times have you kind of rethought that decision? Not that you couldn't be an actor too, but you you literally could have done both, you know what I mean, you know.	0.0
It was a different time again. Like when we look at how it is. Now, everything is so fluid and you know, but before everything was so rigid like this. Is he even back then it was like whoa. If you do television, you'll never be a film star. If you know, if you do film you can't go to tell like people looked at television like it was beneath the people still looked at, you know, you can go on to be a Broadway Legend and like with the music The Duality thing was was kind of rare back then I mean even when you go back before my time is You know, very make Barbra Streisand, you know what I mean? And Frank Sinatra was never really considered an actor. They were just taking advantage of situations, but you didn't certainly from the black side of things. You can see that Duality like that. So, you know, I never really everything happens for a reason and I know I put my all into it so I don't have any regrets in that way. Like I never feel like oh if I would have took this seriously like not took it seriously. I got I got thousands of songs in the stash. So, you know just Just it just wasn't meant for me to do it at that time.	0.0
I guess so out the gate you do juice and you did do some TV stuff in between but movie. Why's your first three out the gate is juice the program and Higher Learning you did Major League to so that's a to yes. That's sure that's that's your for still out the gate. That's a pretty crazy start. What was that time like for you then it was surreal.	1.0
It was surreal. So, you know soju. Comes out and you know, it's just like, you know poison Hood came out. It was just like we felt like it was this new movement. You know hip-hop is everything is happening at the same time like you go back to that time frame. You can't just look back at my career. You gotta look it with hip-hop is that you got look at everything to inform you of how it felt to me because it was just like we just felt like we were at the tip of something, you know crazy happening right now. And if and for the culture this overuse were now but that's what this was like the the second birth of the culture and then, you know book this movie to program which for me was, you know again, I thought I was gonna play football. So now I'm getting to live out this kind of thing and the writer director of that film David Ward, he wrote major league and so while we were filming the program he was like, you know, I guess there's something contractually was happening with Wesley Snipes who played in the original Because I didn't really want to do majorly to that wasn't my cup of tea. But again that loyalty thing I'm like yo this dude gave me my second job site. Let's go rock. So when rock with that and then Higher Learning, I think John Singleton originally wanted to POC to play Malik, but then pop got locked up. And so then the, you know getting higher learning it was it was a glorious time. It was a great time. It was like, you know the to taste your dreams and to get to live them out is invaluable, you know, and You know, you know you making a little bit of money and you know, you just for me it was like surreal I was so young when this whole process by the time that I'm not even 21 by the time you know, Higher Learning is coming out. So it's just like boom boom. Boom.	1.0
You know, how much did you have to adapt to that to now all of a sudden you're famous, you know, right.	1.0
So I was totally disconnected from being a household name because there was no social media, so I didn't know that you didn't know you were famous now, I know. I was famous like in New York, you know what I mean and you know certain places if I went to do promotion and it was it was a different world. So we didn't have that that instant connectivity. So I didn't know how famous if you want to you know, say like that and plus the type of person that I am. I'm more like laid back I had to depart to feign that I really had to you know, I'm from Brooklyn like it wasn't do staring at what they looking at and we got a whole different mindset and they might just want to autograph and it's like oh	0.0
Even you not from gentrify Brooklyn or from like from the pre gentrification Brooklyn, right?	0.0
Yeah, so so me and my crew we we Street about it. So we had to make that adjustment but there was also a lot of love back then and I'm talking about within at least like the New York entertainment Community, you know a lot of cash where you you know, you run into Wu-Tang over here you running the Mobb Deep over here and it was a lot of love like everybody was very supportive of one another. You know what I mean? Because we were Everybody was like we all riding this wave and like where is it going? You know everybody's young everybody's ambitious. You know, you had the Godfather Russell Simmons blazing the trail, you know, you got young puff coming up about to tear it up with bad boy, you know Andre Harrell like it's you know, I just have great memories and you knows a lot of great parties, you know, but, you know when it came to the other stuff it was real it was real it was it was it was Tough times in terms of you know, New York wasn't London and I'm saying that because London has the most cameras in any city in the world. Now New York is like London. This wasn't that New York, you know what I mean? So when you come out the club and you go around the corner to get into it the Wolves is on you so you kind of had to kick up dust so people who they knew who not to you know rock with it in that way, but you know that ain't nothing but a little adjustment.	1.0
So you just said that like Tupac was initially tabbed as Malik. So how did you slide in and get that?	1.0
I don't know. I don't know. I just got the call because I don't know Edition for Higher Learning. I think I got the call. I spoke with John and got the role.	0.0
What was it like working with him?	1.0
John Singleton, John is He was he was super intense. Good good dude fun, you know, but he was really meticulous. That's the one thing. I remember about John like everything had a purpose every single thing on the set. The way the setting was everything had a purpose for him because he was into the he was like a genius Storyteller. So it wasn't just the words coming out of your mouth is what you have on is what's the picture on the wall? wall behind you when you're saying this line and and it was um, it was an intense set and it's really interesting how that was another set where we you can you can this certain projects with it feels bigger than the parts like we're saying something profound here this thing and you could feel that permeating through this set, you know Cube doing his thing and and Jennifer Connelly doing her three Kristy Swanson, but You never know like you look back on high alert and now and it's like sighs like prophetic, you know, you can't really know that in the moment, but I just think you know, that's a testament to his storytelling and you know, he picked he was talking about Universal things and and Timeless things that are unique to the American Experience.	1.0
You know what I'm saying most times when you when you read a script. Do you know if the movie is going to be good at you?	1.0
An idea like some scripts you read you just like this is incredible other scripts you read like hmm, you know, I could see it working. If and then some scripture read. I mean most scripts. I read them like this terrible, you know, I mean you spend most of your time saying no, but you know, you just try to get to those the mid-range ones because the reality is some scripts you read and it's like the concept is there it's not quite executed on paper, but If you get these four actors together, you ain't got to worry about it because they're gonna go boom and do their thing.	1.0
So, you know, what you worried at all after you know, Jewish. I don't even know if they said because you were so young. If this evening entered your mind said that were you concerned that you might get Typecast because as you mentioned if you think about juice in the context of everything else being made at that point, I mean, this is 1992, right? So you got boys in the hood you got mrs. Society, so discussing black trauma and putting black trauma on That way was a big thing. It became a cottage industry where you ever concerned that this is this is who are all of who Hollywood is just going to see you as no, I was never concerned about that because probably to your point because I was too young too, but I was never concerned about it.	1.0
But because I know my abilities and at the end of the day, you know in this business the opportunities that come your way or one thing, but the power that you have is the choices that you make so You can say no, you know what I mean. They were plenty of those 90s films that came my way that I was like, yeah. No, I'm good. All right, you know what I'm saying? And at the same time in the midst of that I did, you know a film for HBO called Daybreak. I did a film called deadly Voyage face, but you know what? I mean, I was throwing these curve balls out there. So you couldn't Typecast me.	0.0
You know, I mean it even higher learning kind of was right, right because you're a college student and athlete again, you know, I mean Not a football player, but a track star so bright that also is showing a different look. So what's the I feel like every actor has a story when asked this question. So what's the role that Got Away the one you either turn down or you maybe you misjudge and like yeah, I don't either the only role they got away from me was in Dead Presidents.	0.0
Lorenz is well and that it didn't supposed to be that no, no, okay. Just beat me out for the role. I went up for the role. They went up for the role and I was like what happened at that joint. It was I already filming it with who learn and I love the rain. So I was like I will you know, he got the better of me that but that's the one when I saw the movie. I was like Tim. She's like yo, he did his thing he did his thing in the movies.	0.0
So there was never one that that you put in the reject pile. That wound up being not something that you would have. Okay. So know your instincts have been pretty good on this cookout.	1.0
Yeah, even when this films that I've been in and out when I'm like but this is how I pay the bills so I gotta do this one.	1.0
So you have you have shot in your mind like a bad movie before absolutely.	0.0
Well, what movie was it - why I want no say it. That was another one. I didn't want to do it, but I'll let the team at the time he was Like really big on the international disrespect to the right of the Rector, but they were like, he's gonna be the next hot thing and Bubba Bubba and I just knew. Like I was of the generation that they were trying to sell that movie too, and I'm like we don't care about the story line like we don't relate to this whole Mod Squad thing the child put we don't but you know the opportunity to work with Giovanni Ribisi and Claire Danes on the face of it.	0.0
It kind of seems like a good idea. You know what I mean to some degree. This is back then so just before rebooting everything, right?	1.0
So it was so destroyed. It was just like link like we don't like like Three like I don't care about link like I don't you skipped a generation. But yeah, that's one joint where I was just and I have a good feeling about you.	0.0
Like I like the head I went back it was her pressure on you because you have been in Black centered movies mean you are that's where you kind of started to build your reputation. How much pressure or was there any pressure at all for you to do something more quote-unquote mainstream?	0.0
No, I wouldn't say it was any pressure because again, you you have to work with the opportunities that come your way I think for me a little further down where in my career and not to fast forward that far but I think that's why house was such a significant move because at that point I was like yo, I got to do something to break out of this mold or if you want to call it that I just knew I had to do something that they do not see coming and nobody saw that coming you CER that way not really, okay only because I was only 14 So and I knew it wasn't you know, it was gonna have that lasting thing. It was a cool little pop up. But I mean it was a cool little pop. It was a biggest show on television, but because I wasn't like entrenched in fashion. It it really didn't hit me that way, you know, but that for me that I was making that move to do house was a great move.	1.0
All right. Well a few moments ago, as you said it was his New York come up all happening at the same time. You mentioned puffy because at that that time bad boy was was blowing up and one of the groups that blows up you have a personal connection to so when we come back from the break we are going to talk about you and the lovely mrs. ABS one member of the group Total certainly one of my favorites growing up. So we're going to talk about her and I'm gonna put you on the spot about a couple things. All right, so don't get too worried. Well get a little bit worried but more with me how you started out co-ed. So you like watch what a hook but more with Omar Epps when we come back. You know, it's not a lot of people I think to these like in these times especially like writing is such an underrated ability and the fact that you've been writing, you know, your whole life is really incredible considering, you know, again, it's just not an ability. I think that a lot of people have is one that's underrated so much so that you follow this path of writing that you wrote a book right from Father list of fatherhood.	1.0
How did that come about that came about when my son was two something happened one night when I came home from work that made me question whether growing up without a father had crept into my father Hood, which is something I never thought about, you know, because I have two other kids, you know, two daughters and so that you know, I was kicking around the idea. That year. I think I kind of rolled out some chapters and I just didn't get to it, you know, and then like a few years ago. I just like I just really need to get this out. So I started writing to explore this question. Like I did Growing Up Without a father creep into my fatherhood and you know halfway through I felt like maybe my story could be a Thule inspiration to others that have similar backgrounds. The things that nature or maybe I don't know maybe it can help. So I you know, I finished finished the book. I decided to self-publish it which is crazy not the recommended thing. But um, you know, and I put it out there and I think you know, it's really getting it was a great run to have those conversations amongst men and women but specifically amongst men within our community about fatherhood and and the responsibilities of the mail, you know, and I black families and it I actually was inspired because a lot of solid father's out there's a lot of young Brothers is you know, they they don't have all the money in the world. They might not have the highest education but then the kids lives and they're trying to make it happen.	0.0
So yeah, one of the statistics that's out there because it seems like Like we whenever there's a discussion about fatherlessness or the father not being in the home. It just makes his way into our community right when the research shows that more than any other racial group. It turns out that black fathers are more involved in terms of you know, childcare reading to their kids like activities like black flower fathers are ranked essentially number one and you know, we know that obviously being you know, The the product of out of wedlock, you know marriage or whatever or I don't like situation. That doesn't mean your father isn't around right and so people sometimes conflate those two. Now you mentioned it was like something that happened. What was the incident that kind of sparked all is well.	1.0
So so I work like a 16-hour day. I came home. I was tired. I just wanted to you know throwing CNN and have a glass of wine go to sleep. And my wife was like Hey, you know, he's still up my son is still up and he was two years old and I was like I'll get to and she kept nagging me about it, and I thought to myself. At least I'm here, you know and then that thought kept echoing in my head because it of course I love my kids, you know, but I was just like damn where did that come from? You know, what does that mean? Like because obviously I like I love my kids more to love myself, but that's that's what kind of got me on that Journey but it's interesting what you say like with these statistics of now because and I touch on this in my book like when I was growing up, You are eyeball if you knew your father like I only knew two dudes who knew any fathers and we used to look at them like y'all weirdos. Yeah, you know and that's how much we had. We had rationalize that trauma and and I think that's a generational thing too. I think you know when you go back, I mean, we're not gonna go too far back, but let's just say from like Vietnam era right you go back then you got a lot of cats coming back home. They on drugs a lot of cats are going to jail and heroines hitting in then the 80s come around. You know for us it's like my mom always says like my generation is like yo, we did the Civil Rights thing y'all go get the bag. You know what I mean? It's like every generation has another thing so you have a lot of you know, a lot of us people my age would whether you college educated or not, you know the out there not just with jobs, but with some form of a career, you know, and they come from not having that think so. Everyone is like we're trying to reverse that cycle or break the cycle, you know what I mean?	0.0
So As a as you mentioned are the father of three what for you is the biggest challenge kind of in fatherhood.	0.0
I think it so I have a 20 year old 15 year old and 11 year old now the you know, I think any parent, you know the for the first thing you want your kids to be safe, right, you know, then you want them to feel loved and then you want them to learn right and to learn to teach themselves. And what I found is that like Parenthood is just like life. It happens in phase. It's like I've never been the father of a 20 year olds. This is a whole new part of the ride so I can you know what? I mean? It's like my daughters like ya next year for my birthday. We gonna have a drink and I'm like, wow, okay, she's gonna be turning 21 wide, right? And so I kind of and I'm and I'm I tell my kids that like, sometimes they come to me with certain things. I'm like, I don't know. I'm trying to figure this out like you are you know, but I think that's the challenge is to one of the other challenges is to sort. of unlearn generational You know patterns that you know that we just do is families or as black families or you know, so like for my kids never beat my kids, you know, I don't want them to get whip now for me. I needed to get whoops. Oh, I'm not mad at my mom's right I get it. But you know as a parent I was just I specially because my first to wil girls I never wanted him to have a memory of a man putting a hand on them and that starts with me now to challenge it at is but it becomes psychological warfare because when they messing up, you know there You need to have some lines of authority. So they learn you know, the rules in life, but then it's like okay, how do you because you certain instinctual feelings you have you know, so it's challenging its challenges constantly challenging that it you know, with the oldest. Like I said, it's like it's a whole new ballgame of Connection and all right, how do you because I can't just snatch you up and throw you in the back. You know, you got your own apartment your own car. So this is all right. How do we wait this out that yeah, but I'm still your father.	0.0
You know I'm saying right now was that more challenging to stick to that, you know not wanting to physically discipline your kids. Was that more challenging with a boy.	0.0
Oh man. That was way more challenging because he's my son. I'm just uh, Now you need to discipline them. And now I tell them now I'm like, yeah, you you the reason why I stay in the gym because when you get 16, I give you that body shot.	0.0
It will have all been worth it because you know one time I mean it is it is I guess a rite of passage that I'm sure you know, you've learned in talking to other guys probably your age at some point like it seems like boys want to challenge their father. Yeah, you know, they think they can whoop y'all. I don't know what that is girls only. We go through that necessarily that we may get real smart mouth and other and like I said psychologically right like to mess with our parents and especially our mothers because I don't know if you've been through the phase yet. I know your oldest is from a previous relationship but been through that phase of like seeing, you know, your wife and your daughter. It's like go at it like world domination is at stake.	0.0
I see that okay this year, especially because like my baby girl, she's just like a different type of personality and we Have an interest in connection because it's like she's I just um, she just like me in a sense of out sometimes my wife gets frustrated and I'm like I go over I say three things and she's like, oh, okay and it works and she says I'm just like, I don't know we got this thing, you know that it works. But with yeah, my son is definitely because he's a mama's boy. And so it's a he's a great kid, but it really is challenging because you want as a man as I look at it. It's like, you know when you discipline your kids like the Appling you're going to receive outside of these walls of our house has no love attached to it. It's just cold. It's just you know what? I mean? So the discipline you receive with us. It's coming from a loving place. There's a lesson to be taught here as a lesson for you to learn and I think like as a man you like, you know, you want your son to be tough. You want to this she wanted to be that but I think you have to meet each child where they're at. They're all three different personalities, you know, and and that's another part of the challenge. Because you just want to sort of lay down this one law that doesn't work for you, you know, and that's you know, when you when you juggle in three different personalities or have them in multiple kids that definitely can be challenging.	0.0
So in the book you discuss the fact that you were 12, I think when you met your father and you guys only spent four days together, what do you remember about those four days?	0.0
Well met my father one time The One and Only Time and we hung out and how did that come about I ended up finding out that my mom tracked him down like he was in Brooklyn the whole time and I guess you know when I was 12, I wasn't a bad kid at all. But you know, you get to that that that point that you're talking about with the boy is like testing the waters already.	0.0
I feel yourself a little bit, right?	1.0
Yeah. So Mom Dukes was like I got to find your father and you know, and and she tracked him down and You know, I'd look it's spitting image of this guy. So so for me, it was a it was a it was weird because it was like looking at a it was like being around a stranger who looks just like you and and at the time my sister was six weeks old. So he's he had just had her and you know went to his house where he was staying with his girlfriend at the time, so I went over there. The next day went over there and hung out and it was just I remember was just like a odd feeling because you know, I had built up had so much resentment and anger at that point, even though I was only 12, but I was I guess I opened myself like I let me see what this is about and then you know, two three days later. That was it. You know, he just went back into the Shadows.	0.0
Where are you? Even though he like he said it was awkward, but were you expecting more? Did you did you have the expectation in your mind that a relationship a full-blown would relationship was coming as a result of that short time you spent together, you know, it's funny.	0.0
I didn't know what to expect. I think you know because originally like when my mom was telling me I was hesitant, you know, I was you know, I don't need to meet him and you know, she was just like no just meet your father and I should you know, and and when I think about it now and my mother and I have never Discussed this but when I think about it now, you know, some of that was probably for her as well like yo, I had this kid together married for a couple of years like you ain't been in his life and which would make sense to me. I get it like at least see him once you know, but for me, I really didn't have any expectation, you know, and It you know, it's a it's a weird thing, you know, but for me, I took all of those emotions and I turned them into fuel a really transformed all of those. I guess you could call them negative feelings and I transformed it into fuel, you know, and and and I also use that you know, I felt like I'm the man of the house. I gotta protect you. I gotta protect my mother. I'm gonna make sure she good, you know, and I took it and ran.	1.0
Yeah. Allotted to deal with that with that age, right?	1.0
I mean that's a pretty heavy burden it is but you know, when that's again when this is all you're seeing, you know, and then I go back into my own family and I see the patterns of fatherlessness and if that's all you know it and that's what's normal, you know, so this is what all my friends felt, you know what I mean? It's set for the to now the two who knew their fathers. Love them. You know what I mean? Love them. They I got a lot of juice for them and I learned through their Actions, you know on how to parent like you said earlier actively like they was always around one of my boys is you know, you had four boys they let me times like you need a new you 16 need a car. I'm here. He was still cool with their moms at if it's something broke at their house. He would come through fix, you know, if they had barbecues he was still around, you know, and my other friend is his parents were still married. So, you know that that but his father wasn't was another one that was like, you know, I was like I ain't Because you just you get to see the living blueprint, you know of black father who specifically when you when your dad passed.	1.0
How did that make you feel? I mean any other than just obviously somebody you know dying that your that's your father. But how did it make you feel given the lack of relationship that was there?	0.0
You know, what's interesting is like I didn't feel I felt sad for him because so let me take you through the so so that happened at 12:00 right when I'm 21 reconnected with my father and that's when I came into my sister's life. Then that dissipated now. I mean I've been in my sister's life ever since then but I'm saying him and I was relationship. I'm 25. I try to do it again doesn't work. Then when I was about to turn 30 at a long conversation with one of my aunts that inspired me to try to rekindle that didn't work and so through my life up to you know, when he passed away. I had tried to open this door, but through that experience. I learned that you know Every relationship has to be a dialogue and can't be a monologue. And for some reason when certain, you know, we would talk about certain things and when certain things would come about he would certain Poise a conversation will come about he would just close off he would just close off and so, you know, I told them, you know, I told them I forgave him. I told him, you know, it's all love and you know, I gave him those things and you know, I would tell him I'm saying, you know, they must be if we're both still here God must have a purpose for us to build something, you know, so so when he passed, you know, and I'm saying this just to be honest with you and I'd say this with no I'm not trying to be it was like hearing that someone passed, you know outside like when I leave here, you know, it was like a stranger because I didn't know and For me, I just felt more sad for him because it didn't have to be that way, you know, and he had other kids. He had one other son who he was in and out of his life. So but I was the first one I was the oldest and there was a point that like I did so let me tell you this other part like with my sister. I I got to a point where I was like I was willing to have been the guinea pig like I get it I was your first kid is all new to you volleyball. But when I saw that he repeated that pattern with my sister, that's when I lost a bit of respect. I come on like I would have much rather. That's when I had expectation. I thought at that point he would have been like yeah, I figured it out. Okay, you know also given but when he repeated that same pattern with her That's you know, that was a disappointment.	0.0
Did he ever give you an explanation why he was wired that way to be just in and out of his kid's life or specifically in and out of your life.	0.0
No, he never gave me a straight forward answer was just like, you know things happen or you know that and I even when I would question him about his own family like, you know, your siblings and this and how did because his family was from, Norfolk, Virginia? My will how did you end up in New York and how even when I'm you know, if I talk to my mom about like she can only go to a certain point because you know, she didn't know his family or she knew he had the one cousin over here. But you know, there's just so many just gray areas of, you know, we don't have the information and you know in some of our conversations. I've really tried to open that door like share your story. Like I know you have a story to like, you know, and he like I said, he would just close off he was just	0.0
Clothes on what was that? I know you obviously read a whole book about it. But what was maybe the one pattern that you could recognize that you were even though you're clearly present and your children's life, but maybe what was the one emotional pattern that you could recognize that you were repeating based off what you had kind of learn or didn't learn from not having a relationship with your father.	0.0
I think it's more the latter. I mean for me, you know not having a relationship with my biological father is it? Headed in me very young way before I decided to have kids like I'm never going to be anything remotely close to that. Right and that that will present its own challenge to a person because that's such a low bar. I'm gonna be there.	1.0
It's like other your kids right exactly like that Chris Rock joke, I take care of my kids you suppose these phones to really act like they babysitting their own children, but it's you know, when it will you grow without your father like just accomplishing that like,	1.0
In there, you kind of look at that as an accomplishment, but you know, you have to be active you keep using that word active in Paris. And that's the truth. Like you can't just send a check or pay bills like you gotta be active because kids remember everything but money they remember time. Yeah. They remember when you weren't there exactly. Yeah. So, you know for me I would say, you know, it was more about out of there was no pattern that continued. I think it was just like I set the It for me was going to be the opposite of what he presented.	0.0
So let's talk about your lovely wife. As I mentioned before one of the group members of total who we was all rocking out to in the 90s. How did you how did you two meet we met Pope at a party? And so you actually met at a puffy party. Yeah, that's makes this even better.	1.0
Yeah, we met at a party and it was one of those it was just one of those, you know. Oh, they one of those fairy tale moments. They write about in the movies. Like I'm in the party. She's in there. I see her across the room and the whole room disappeared and let me guess kissing you started playing now. I'm okay, but real talk like the whole room disappeared and I'm just staring at her and got caught her eye. She staring at me and I was kind of you know, shy so we kind of both shuffled and kind of made like a Mid-ground like I'm not going to your sides. You're not going to my side and then I think I just walked past and I just like your eyes are beautiful and she was like, so are yours and then that was it? Okay. I got the number. It's when you had the right down and oh you got a pen. Yep, you know what? I mean got the number and then hit us. I've known her since I was 18.	1.0
So, how is how did you guys manage that like you both kind of were blowing up simultaneously. So how did that impact?	1.0
The relationship well, was it open about our story is so for the first two years of us knowing each other. We were just friends platonic like we would just I was the homie and then we started dating, you know, we kind of dating but then like after about a few months like six months ironically enough. I was the one that was like we probably shouldn't date. And she was like, wow, I was like yo you about to do your thing. I'm about to do my thing. I really love our friendship and I don't want to do anything to disrupt that and I don't want to like you're supposed to you were young like, you know what I mean? Like, I don't want to resent you. I don't want you to resent me and so we kind of went back to friends and then a few years after that we kind of just Kind of grew apart, you know a little bit I moved out here to LA and and then one night. I'm in the club and I'm going to the bathroom and this girl is like oh, you know my homegirl Keisha and I'm like Keisha's fight me and she was like, yeah. I'm like call her. And she called her and we got on the phone and she can tell Amy left.	1.0
Yes. So you guys were able to just like pick up as if almost like no time had elapsed.	1.0
Yeah kinda sorta we had picked up because they think like we we laugh about this now but like, you know as they start blowing up and that part when I say, we, you know, we stopped dating and whatever, you know, I've started this is when cell phones is just coming around like it's normal for people who haven't Phone call the number change. So I call them all script like yo her number change. Yeah, she ain't give you the new number his number. I'll call yo. Why don't you be the new number? Oh, I forgot Bubba Bubba that happened like one other time and I was like yo the next time your number change and you don't give me the new number. I ain't calling you no more and the number chanting I and I didn't call her no more and that's how we grow apart. But you know, what's the funny part? One of the funny parts of this story is her homegirl that I just mentioned two weeks before that they would I think they was in Atlanta and she said they would just you know, the girls night Sex in the City whatever and they just got into a random conversation with a homegirl a sir. Who's the one you know, who's the guy that you know you would you feel like got away or that you would marry the drop of a dime and she said me. Is it was okay that it out? So then two weeks later. I'm in a club in a home girls like oh, you know quiche and she called me I was that was the girl is crazy.	1.0
Wow. Well story so give her her musical background your musical background. How can we see a collab album?	1.0
Well now we've I wrote on their first album, actually I wrote um, she gives me writing credit, but I helped her write a couple joints on the first time, but you know, it's waiting on huh You know how she went headfirst into mommyhood. So we'll see but she's an incredible songwriter.	1.0
Yeah, was that something that you know, you guys kind of both wanted or like how did that kind of come about in the sense of it just happened organically because when we reconnected they were in the middle they have another album.	1.0
They were recording the third album that was fired by the way, and I don't know the on the business end of things, you know, she was a she was tied with the industry and all that. This is Prior to streaming. This is prior to this new wave of how you know, everything is done. And I don't know we just decided to do us, you know, and I've always been supportive whatever she wants to do like build a studio in the crib like what you know, take it at your own pace, but she was just like no I'm going to do my kids like I don't want to deal the industry, you know, and I think it is difficult. I think for anybody but especially a woman, you know, My once you have a baby and you know what, I mean, like you, you know, haven't her having had hustle so long. She just kind of wanted to take a breather and really be with her kids and not like do both but you know, she still she got some some joints in a stash for sure.	1.0
Oh you've been in this business since you were 17, when you look back over your career, which obviously is, you know, still going pretty strongly what it's not I don't mean necessarily. In terms of a movie or a role but like what are you most proud of when you look back on the longevity of your career?	1.0
That's a good question for me. I don't know if there's one thing I could point to to say. I'm most proud of I mean, I'm proud of the whole my whole career and and I'm excited about the now and the future, you know, and as my career evolved. I mean, I guess I'm proud that I've pretty much I was able to preserve my Integrity, you know, and you know my for the most part keep my moral compass as a man, you know, and that means something to me, but for me like my career is like pieces of Mosaic like half of it is done. That's the half we talking about another half. It's like it's not there yet because I love it. I love the whole thing. I Fact that I get the opportunity to take care of my family doing what I love to do is supreme blessing.	1.0

Well, that's it. I want to thank you for spending this time with me today. I appreciate it going down memory lane. And that's great that you've written a book about fatherhood because you know black fatherhood is something that's that's not discussed enough or at least not discussed in the context in which you're discussing it like a lot of times. It's always the conversation is always about what black fathers aren't doing right as opposed to this is how you manage, you know, being a black father and what that means. So you speaking to it from that perspective I think is probably I'm sure Go help somebody hopefully yeah. All right. Well, good luck to you Cowboys. Yes. Okay. Thank you for having me. Yeah, no, no problem anytime. And yeah, I hope for your sake this season doesn't go doesn't derail. Just why I'm for nice family. Wow, that was real convenient that a real comedian. I've been a life long life long flight a lifelong fan. I suffered through them Jim druckenmiller League druckenmiller years, so I been rocking with porn star Jimmy. See, how you doing? Listen, here's your man. It got a hundred million. Yeah. Listen wewe good Richard. Sherman is out there ball and defense looking great at the number one defense in the NFL. Y'all look good.

Well, you live out here. I was like, yeah, I kind of like both. Okay. Alright, you like a loli. But anyway, thank you. Good luck with everything Omar's getting out of here, but I'm still sticking around one more segment to go. Y'all know what's coming people fucking I'm bothered. When I was in high school, my mother told me she had one goal for me to make sure I made it out of high school without getting pregnant. Now. My mother had me when she was 18 years old. So she was coming from a perspective of having truly been there and done that. I like a lot of other young women. I got the usual speech about sex keep your legs closed, but she also put me on birth control pills when I Fifteen or sixteen years old. She taught me how to properly put on a condom. She talked to me very openly about sex point. Is she army with the information she felt like I needed in order to make informed decisions about my own body. Now young people in sex is always going to be a polarizing emotional topic. And so I understand why everybody lost their shit when TI who was one of my first podcast guest said during a podcast interview recently that he went to the gynecologist with his daughter every year. And when she was in high school to quote check her hymen, in other words to ensure she was still a virgin the backlash was immediate Swift severe and intense but T. I also received a lot of support from both men and women for what he said now before diving into the reaction a few things need to be cleared up in the aftermath TI and Tiny who appeared on red table talk, which is hosted by Jada Pinkett Smith and her mother they told their side of the story T. I explained that he was joking. King and embellishing he did not go to the gynecologist with his daughter every year. He explained he did accompany his daughter and Tiny to the gynecologist once and it was mostly happenstance. He said he has never been in the examination room with his daughter and when he was at the gynecologist, she welcomed his presence but here's an excerpt from that conversation on red table talk.	1.0
She understands my intentions and she knows who I am. She knows who I've always been right and I think that that it allows a certain level of understand. I mean, it's just the outside the the noise. Yeah is is distracting is confusing and hurtful. It is is hurtful and embarrassing. She was horrified when I definitely understood why she would be, you know feel like, you know was personal to her right?	0.0
Geishas are quiet child.	0.0
She doesn't talk a lot doesn't you know, you know after	0.0
Things out of her right because we as women understand how especially for young girl. Mmm how delicate and what it exposes about her very private, especially to all of our intimate life.	0.0
Yeah. I don't I didn't I didn't get it. I was oblivious to it. However, I am now sensitive to it for her now.	0.0
I wanted to stay out of this because how TI raises his family ate my concern and it ain't my business. However, I am absolutely a here for a larger conversation about how girls and women's bodies are constantly being policed. Now, I will always be bothered by the fact that we are so consumed and fixated on the sexual behavior and the bodies of girls and women and I mean by both men and women case in point how many times have you heard men and some women but mostly men say they don't want a girl because then they have to worry about her getting pregnant or they don't want a girl because they don't want to think about all the boys and men trying to have sex with her and someday it will It their attitude is based off their own personal experience. They knew there was a time when they weren't shit, so they didn't want their own daughter exposed to some Reincarnation of their ancient Indus. So before a girl is even born before she even gets here people already policing her body. Now we have to deal with that our entire lives as women. Not just for my fathers brothers or Uncle's women can be just as guilty I often say this when discussing racism and racial oppression. Ian the real unfairness of dealing with those issues is that the burden and responsibility to solve the problem is placed squarely on the people most victimized by it. So when we have these conversations about rape and sexual assault the conversation is solely centered around women and what we need to do to protect ourselves. There's certainly a place for that but who is having conversations with young boys and men about consent about respect about keeping their hands to themselves if you don't want some asshole boy dish. Affecting your daughter then use that same energy with boys that you have when you want to police girls and women about their bodies instead of telling boys and men and run through as many girls and women as possible. If you want girls and women to be treated better. If you want us to be respected. It's simple raise better men stay on bothered.

Hello. We're talking to Nicole Anderson today. She is a fellow YouTuber her channel is called taboo topics. She also has a website of the same name called taboo topics.com and her motto is challenging tradition changing Minds choosing happiness. Nicole was a Christian for 10 years and just recently It came out as an atheist very bravely and publicly on her channel. So you still have a bunch of Christian friends. I presume.	1.0
Yeah, it's so funny reading some of the comments on my YouTube channel because they're all like saying that I'm running around is like an atheist circle now and it's the actually like complete opposite of that. Like I still have all of my same friends from Junior High and high school and they are like all Christians and I'm kind of the only one that left. left which is kind of what has been so hard about this whole journey is just being like, you know the odd one out and it's just interesting to see like how his like I totally understand like not all Christians at the same and people are like don't just let like a few bad apples like ruin your experience, but I'm like guys like I love my friends like I know that they're not like bad people but I'm just sit like my whole thing is that sometimes the things that they Believe and do and say because of that can be hurtful and I don't think people realize that you know, and I've just like experienced a lot of that with my very conservative Evangelical fundamentalist fundamentalist friends.	1.0
You know, yeah, you have the conservative fundamentalist friends in particular because I have Christian friends, but I tend to only steer towards the ones that don't drive me insane.	0.0
Yeah, it was crazy. Well like my whole experience with Christianity stemmed from my friend group. Like I wasn't raised a Christian I was raised and like just a very loving secular home and religion wasn't talked about and so, you know actually like First experience with Christianity happened when I was 12 years old. I was in my seventh grade science class and we were learning about Evolution exempt these two girls got so mad and they were like, what about Adam and Eve? What about the Garden of Eden? Like how can you be teaching this stuff in a public school? Like they were so mad and I was like, who are you talking about? Like who's Adam? Who is Eve? Like I didn't I was so ignorant. Ignorant and so I think at that point I kind of like became their salvation project and I was starting from like a blank slate like I didn't know anything about religion really and so I kind of just accepted that what they were saying was true and my parents never wanted to tell me like what to believe or what not to believe but that kind of lead to like an unhealthy. Like one-sided argument that was like filling my brain coming from my friends and I didn't like I don't know. I didn't necessarily critically think too much about it.	0.0
I was only 12 and I just remember that's when it happened for me to 12. Yeah. Yeah because I used to be a casual Roman Catholic. Very passionate about God though. I always really felt I always talk about these like bedside moments that I had when I I was a little girl and I really felt a connection to the spiritual and to the Beyond. Yeah, and it wasn't until I was 12 that I went to this Born Again Church. That was Evangelical and you know now looking back I believe that's when I got really messed up and some really toxic thinking and toxic beliefs and fear fear fear fear.	1.0
Yeah, you know that might have been what it was because I was never around like a liberal Christians. It was the very extreme. Evangelical fundamentalist and I didn't know that that was like a small sect of Christianity like even recently I just thought that that was normal Christianity and I was like, you know always made to feel like, you know, any type of disagreement was just you're not being a real Christian. You're not being a good Christian. But yeah from the very beginning it was just like this constant theme of Of like you think your life is good now, but it can be so much better like is if you believe in Jesus like you will be like infinitely better. And yeah, it's funny like you mentioned the bedside moments because I still like so vividly remember sitting in my bed one morning when I was 12, and I was praying to God and attempting to repent for my sins, but I just kept saying Did I didn't know what I had done wrong? Like I didn't understand why I was so unworthy and undeserving of his love. I didn't like feel like I was the sinful person that was filled with like the innate evil of Adam and Eve like that. They let into this world. But like that's what I was reading. And that's what I believe like it was the inspired word of God. I thought it was true and all the worship songs in youth group and stuff just kept saying like I want more of you God and less of me and it just kind of like shrunk. I'd like shrunk myself down and felt like I must have been doing something wrong in his eyes and like for that I was truly sorry and you know begged for his forgiveness. And I don't know it was just like this constant theme of know your place like you are inferior by Design and I didn't realize it back then but that was like when my healthy amount of self-worth started to Chip Away And it was like crazy that that was like the moment that I dedicated my life to Christ. Yeah, and then like for 10 years after that Christianity kind of consumed my life my friend group. We would have liked deep discussions all the time. I would go to youth group devotional groups summer school, like summer camps Bible studies. I was a youth leader for a while. And it was just a very like simple Faith but I was always told that you're not supposed to intellectualize your face or critically think too much about it. And I kind of feel like not teaching apologetics is like doing a disservice to your congregation because you know people might hear about these things eventually and then I mean that's like what happened to me in my last semester of college after You know, I was 22 so it had been 10 years. My roommate was a religious studies minor and she was doing all of this research for her classes. And you know, she was having like people that were on the committee of translating the ancient Greek manuscripts like as her teacher and they were telling her these things that I just knew nothing about and it was that same sort of feeling I had when I was 12, it was like wow, like I'm so ignorant like there's so much more. I need to know. And so I that's when I like started my deep study of Theology and I went into it as a Christian wanting to be a better Christian thinking that I was going to like, you know be so solid in my faith and then just as I continue down that path like things slowly started to like not make sense with like the Christian doctrine and my faith was like unraveling I guess in my questions. We're too hard and Too Deep for the Christians around me to answer I guess so I was kind of on my own and I yeah, I decided that like I just didn't think the facts were there. But honestly the damaging part came like after I left like once I just decided I don't think this is true. I don't think I'm going to call myself a Christian anymore. That's when I started like feeling the damaging effects of like what? It happened like the past 10 years, basically.	0.0
What is that? What is that look like or feel like to leave and then get that reaction.	1.0
I mean there were so many different aspects of it. You know, one of the aspects was this idea. Like I started viewing Christianity differently and I know a lot of Christians will probably disagree with this interpretation, which is totally fine. I just think it's important to realize that there are a lot of people out there. There who will hear the gospel message and they'll interpret it in kind of the way that I started seeing it and it's not necessarily always healthy because I remember looking back and you know asking myself like why I could never bring myself to get baptized even though so many people encouraged me to do it and I think part of me subconsciously disagreed with this idea of like dying to yourself like this. Idea that you are your intrinsic self needed to die that there wasn't anything like good about you. Unless God was living in you and you were reborn as Christ and it just seemed so hurtful to me and like looking back now. I don't think I ever felt broken enough to need a savior. My self-image wasn't bad enough like my life wasn't shattered enough for me to view myself. Business like dirty rags that God Compares artworks to in the Bible and this just kind of made me see how religion doesn't work as well. If you start out with a healthy amount of self-worth because then when I was going through harder times in life, I remember thinking how easy it would be to like go back to church and to feel better and you know, there would be so many people who would instantly care about And it give me attention and support and comfort me and try to make me feel better. And that was so appealing but it made me realize how this idea of God and religion could so easily be used as a Band-Aid like for our problems. It made me feel like religion was like preying on the weak and in those vulnerable moments, like it's so easy to want a savior, but I needed to like pull myself back into reality and be like Intellectually, though. This doesn't add up in my head. So like I don't know. I didn't want to take the easy way out and just like go back and then oh gosh, like there's just so much of out of this is how I felt but it's like you're not capable of anything without God and everything good is because of him and everything bad is because of you and like he deserves all the glory and you're just a vessel completely worthless without him and Like if you leave God your life will be miserable. And that's what I was always told and that's I think what really hurt me afterwards like when I was like, I don't believe this anymore like but people are still telling me like he needs to be the priority in your life. And like if he's not bad things will happen to you and like yeah this one time. Yeah like this one time my friend. I was telling her that I had filled out this job application and it was a writing application. So I had to write like a ton of like not essays but like a lot of prompts and then I hit submit and my internet had gone out and it got all deleted and instead of just being like yeah, that sucks like, you know the internet but she was like wow God is really trying to get you back and in my head I'm like God is going out of his way to like make my life miserable so that all come back to him like that doesn't make any sense. Like, how do you I don't know how can you think that way because that just sounded like manipulation.	0.0
It's all so yeah, I mean There are so many levels of toxicity with that because you know, that was a huge part of my life really imploded. I started being you know, you and I have this in common where we both had a breakthrough moment where we became very explorative and intellectual and curious about our religion. I left it as well. I didn't I would always say like I was never capable of leaving God or feeling disconnected from my virtual side, but I had to leave the actual building of the church because these things just weren't resonating anymore. And when you're surrounded by people that say every bad thing in your life is happening because of what you're doing wrong. It creates is never ending anxiety and and it's just not true.	0.0

Yeah, and I think it's also incredibly disenchanting and a huge part of my audience is you know, there are atheists that are genuine atheists and there are quote unquote atheists that are just really hurt Christians and I see both and I don't you know, I don't say they're always one or the other but that does exist and the reason is because also we're told that every good good thing happens because we're involved in church and because we're being perfect and we're saving ourselves and we're honoring our husband and we're listening to our leaders and tithing and when you're doing all that and you're in a sexless marriage or in my case, like you find out your husband was cheating on you and it rocks your world like then all of a sudden you're like wait all of these things that were supposed to protect me that I have been doing right, you know, like I used to Like the girl to find girls and that's why I harp on them so much for anyone listening. That doesn't know Nicole and I are both YouTubers. So there's this whole life Christian space of YouTube, which is very Niche but it's so funny thing always get recommended to me too.	0.0
I'm like YouTube is crazy like why I recommend you all these videos to me.	0.0
But yeah, but um, these two girls are you know, like I have no hatred for them at all. It just breaks my heart that there for me still. So giving a lot of toxic information that has been very destructive for me. And the people that I know and love. Yeah, and I just think they're too young and inexperienced and they don't have enough like a wide enough grasp of the world to actually speak to those topics at the top of their intelligence because you know, you're not supposed to question. You also brought up before like we are taught to fear our emotions they always use the Verse, that's like the heart is deceitful.	0.0
Above All Things. Oh, yeah, that was quoted to me my whole life.	1.0
Yeah, and really that's the way of Christians silencing and shaming each other into shutting up. Like if you have a you know with my being gay is not a sin videos that I just came out with so many people are like don't trust your heart your heart is deceitful and it's like you got your telling me that we need to abandon our like intellectual the only what happened like Ville of your reality.	0.0
Yeah that never made sense to me because it honestly it was used as just like a silencing tactic and a way for like Christians to feel like they could be above other Christians. I feel like like they felt like their point was like being offended when they could pull that verse out and kind of like it's because they don't have a point but beyond that point.	0.0
Yeah, like if someone shuts you down and another phrase that uses cherry picker, you can't cherry pick. The Bible and what's convenient for you? And it's like well that phrase is really convenient because all you have to do is like and I remember feeling that way when I was saying these things to I knew that if you scratched a tiny bit below the surface, I would have to be like, I don't know shut up like like I don't have an answer be on don't trust your heart and I don't have an answer be on my pastor told me so so everybody shut up, you know, like well, I don't want people to fear that that's why I respect what you're doing. Doing so much and I don't see our channels or our ideals in major conflict. Actually.	0.0
I'm not a liar the fact that you're an atheist. Yeah and like that. I recommend your channel to so many people who comment on my videos because yeah because like you do not at all represent the things that I am opposed to you know, like and I think it goes back to this idea of when I was a Christian and when I would kind of be going Like what you're going through trying to defend gay marriage and like all these things. I was always very analytical of this idea of God and in my head I was like if you're telling me that he's a loving God. I feel like we have to be able to attribute certain qualities to this deity. And so often when you are kind of like the girl to find girls who are living in this Christian bubble who like just read the scripture in her.	0.0
So like blindly following it without opening their mind to any sort of like, I don't know the only very specific scriptures, by the way, because yeah, they much like me or the pastor's I've had would quote like something really beautiful and then you read two lines down and it's like by the way, like slavery is should be honored and you're like wait what people that's what's so funny because I recently did a video about gay marriage as well and I was responsible.	0.0
Going to a channel called Paul and Morgan and they were quoting Leviticus and then all these people were commenting saying if you just read a few more verses down like that's the same book that talks about not getting a tattoo and she has a tattoos all over her arm.	1.0
I know and I know the hypocrisy of that drives me crazy and well again for anyone listening that's not from the Christian background Leviticus is in the Old Testament and it's a very very very very heavy-handed role oriented book and and the rules include, you know, you should be basically ostracized from your community for having period sex no tattoos. No and then or like man shall not lie with a man, but you're like wait you guys? Oh, don't braid your hair.	0.0
These are no mixing Fabrics. Like they are very specific things.	1.0
So for any modern Christian, you know, that's one of my main argument. To it's like we can't be citing this ancient texts that we've already willfully decided as a community that we're abandoning the majority of these like tenants. Yeah, but you're still conveniently for the sake of your argument pulling from that like you said ignoring the fact that you girl are covered in tattoos.	0.0
So stop with that. Yeah, but like, of course, I knew like that there were hypocrisies about Among the like Christian Community and so I don't want anyone to ever think like that's why like I left because I've always granted like there are you know, good people and bad people in every community and every group, you know, and so so I never really liked of course things could be hurtful but like that never caused me to then think like, oh, well God must not be true because all these Christians are hypocritical. Like it was never that way of thinking and I know it's hard for some people to understand like one of my videos recently got promoted by YouTube and it's actually really annoying because I have all of these Christians who are just so hateful like leaving so many nasty comments. I'm just like why are you liked so many people try to say like like not all Christians are bad, but like when 99% of the people are so I mean and then you get like one nice one and it's like okay obviously like something needs to change here, but they were all saying like you were never a real Christian. You must have never been saved like that's just impossible because and I feel like it's a defense mechanism where it's like if I was a real Christian and then left like what does that say about their belief system, you know, absolutely I think it's very fear and that's like it's so much projection and that's why you know,	0.0
No, I'm no better or worse than anyone else. But that's why I keep saying like don't be afraid to have a real conversation with an atheist or like someone outside of your belief system. They can't you know stand firm in your beliefs. Don't be scared. And if there's something that scares you then dive in deeper like yeah, it's scared me when I read, you know, women need to be silent at church. That was one of my really defining moments where I shut the Bible and looked up at God and just was like yo, Yeah, what like I was like so beside myself about that. I was like just like I've been honoring you all of these years and I'm made to like sit here and read that like, what does that mean? And it did not shake my faith. It didn't turn me away from God instead. It caused me to be more intellectual about my faith to be more curious about the history of it and I'm far from knowing everything but like People should be inspired to be intellectual not scared of it.	1.0
Yeah, there's this Christian who I actually really like I mean, I disagree with a lot of what he says, but I really like him and his name is Sean McDowell and he gave like this really cool talk where he pretended to be an atheist at a Christian college and he put on his atheist glasses me like talk to them as if he was an atheist giving all of like, you know, the atheist answer. is I guess and for the most part I thought he did a pretty good job, but then he kind of like took his glasses off and was like, like how do you guys think you did and it was just it was like how did you feel when you were being like questioned by me and like you weren't really winning the argument so to say like and they were like like I was mean to you like I was aggressive and I was defensive and you know, I felt attacked and I just wanted to prove you wrong so bad. Like I wasn't being loving through that and he his point was basically like Christians shouldn't be scared of Doubt because they should be a Christian because they believe that it is true. And if it after all of the research that you do if you come to the conclusion that you don't think it's true. Then you shouldn't be a Christian and he said that's okay you like you have to not be afraid of just pouring all the facts. Out there and and being true to yourself in that and of course he wants everyone to be saved but like no, that's really beautiful.	1.0
I love ya. Can I ask what was the video that YouTube started promoting of yours God.	1.0
I don't even like the video it was dumb. It was video called why I left Christianity and it was actually a response video to a different video that I had made where I had said like, you know, I was silenced in church and like I wasn't allowed Odd to ask questions and like all this stuff and people were like, you know commenting on that and so I did a response video basically clarifying saying I was allowed to ask questions, but I could only ask them once and then once I asked them and got the Christian answer it was like that's your answer like accept it and if it wasn't good enough for me. It was like why are you like beating a dead horse? Why are you still so like, you know, you're just trying to like, you know, put your Deceitful Wicked heart into scripture because you want you know it to be the way you want it to be in like all this stuff and it was just such a misinterpretation of me. Just trying to like learn more and do research and it was like if you keep talking like that you're going to talk yourself right out of this face like you don't sound like a Christian to me and it was just kind of a lot of kind of it wasn't even a very accurate title now that I'm thinking about it because I truly clarified and said I left because I didn't think If the facts were there but in the midst of me doing all this research and and kind of getting all these questions brought to the surface. I was a bit frustrated that I was like borderline not even a Christian at this point and yet you know people I knew who wanted to go into Ministry who were dedicating their life to this Faith didn't even care enough to know the deeper side of their belief system. Like they just had no interest in looking deeper and study. Harder in in answering my questions and like I understood that everyone has their own life and you know, they can't just put it on pause to then, you know study all this stuff with me, but it did frustrate me that the church in itself did a poor job of preparing Christians for the tough questions. Like if there's an atheist who knows apologetics better than Christians, that's that's not good. Good, you know I don't know I feel like that video was like misinterpreted through the YouTube space is crazy.	0.0
I keep telling my friends. I almost feel quite lonely in it because nobody else understands what I'm going through necessarily. Yeah, and it's fine. I'm not like going through stuff but like but at the same time, I'm like, yeah, I wake up every morning and people are screaming that I'm going to hell and like it just kind of feels like garbage to my soul sometimes.	0.0
Yeah. It has to be even worse for you because they say that to me but if I don't believe in hell, it doesn't really affect you as much I can't imagine that's horrible.	0.0
Yeah. Well and I think that I usually think comments are they make me laugh and I actually really enjoy talking to haters like yeah, you know the sweet-looking, you know young person just wrote something like well you're sending everyone to hell and you're going to hell yourself. And yeah, I just like called her out. and was like hey, why do you believe that like, do you know that I'm a person and you're saying that to me on the internet and that's like actually such a terrible thing to say to somebody and a lot of them apologize because it's not about me convincing them that my way of thinking is right, but it's more about the more defensive you are and lieu of actually being an empath and listening and like allowing people to On their own Journeys with patience and love instead of always trying to like get everyone onto your team. The more effective you are just as a human being in general, but especially as a Christian, I don't understand what church is telling people that's emboldening them to go online screaming about someone else going to hell like that's yeah. Jesus was not walking around Jerusalem screaming about hell. Yeah, so I'm like, where where did you guys even get that from and what? What scripture is that the way you're supposed to be handling people that you disagree with?	0.0
Yeah, sometimes I'll read the like really mean comments from Christians and I'll just comment back and just be like do you think like you said that out of love like it was that really a loving thing to say like it just it doesn't mean McColl its righteous judgment and I have every right.	0.0
Yeah, pretty much. What was the feeling of really coming into your atheism?	1.0
Well a lot of People kind of say like, oh you just threw the baby out with the bathwater like you jumped from Christian to atheism and that wasn't the case at all. I actually still believed in God for probably two years after I stop calling myself a Christian and I just had this feeling of like organized religion put God in a box and like it forced us to have these certain stories that were culturally specific and that didn't, you know, go over like to other countries. Or whatever and I just remember having this like since the freedom where it's like I could go to any country and experience like what they consider like profound spirituality and I could apply that to my life without feeling like, you know, it's not accurate and and I just remember thinking like all these religions throughout the entire world have claimed to have spiritual experiences. They've To have these miracles happen and I just I didn't like thinking like they were wrong and I'm right and like my specific story is like the one true truth and like shedding to that story itself allowed me to view like God in a much more like open way that I found super inclusive and inviting and more cohesive. And you know, I still actually hold a lot of those values. Like I want I think I'm still slightly bitter when it comes to organized religion, but I definitely want to get to the point where I can go, you know to other countries and experience, you know, their religion and their culture and everything that comes with that and just, you know, apply that to my life and you know become a better person based off of these were	0.0
The experiences we'll buy a theist and and not agnostic.	1.0
Well, I actually consider myself an agnostic atheist. So basically agnosticism is, you know a claim about knowledge. Like I don't know if there's a God or not, but I'm an atheist because I don't currently believe in one. I don't I don't think that I don't know like I don't think there's a God I don't Necessarily see a lot of proof of a God, but I'm more open to that conversation of maybe because I know like when people start talking about science and I start talking about like the origins of the universe and all this stuff. Like that's very fascinating to me and it's not something that I have studied as much as I would like to um, but I never want to be like one of those people where I'm like, yeah, there's absolutely definitely not a God and I'll fight you like to Able to prove that it's like no like I don't have this like hidden agenda. Like I don't want there to not be a God on top of that my friend circle like since their identity was in Christ my identity to them became non-Christian like that is all I was to them or that's how it felt and I would be like introduced as like, oh, this is Nicole. She's a non-Christian. Like this is my reward. Yeah, like to their new like church friends and you know more extended people it was like this is my non-Christian friend like that will know that was my label and it was so like demeaning and I'm like literally that's all I am. That's all they see is the lack of belief in their God and then I've had some people stay like you're never going to know true Joy or true happiness or true fulfillment. You're never Have purpose and your life is like destined to be meaningless because you don't believe in our God and that's just like so mean to say and it like really breaks people down and I think that goes back to this idea of like if you break people down enough, they might come back to the belief system and it's like such a manipulative way of going about things for them.	1.0
But I always I feel like it's so much fear because I remember feeling I remember being on the opposite side of that I could see myself introducing someone as a non-Christian back in the day, not tomorrow. Yeah, but I was I love God so much and I have for so long that if anyone didn't have that and then and then when I can Christian church or an Evangelical Church when they're pounding into our heads like you said, this is your identity. This is the thing that gives you purpose. This is where true happiness. Flies I just felt sad for people that didn't have that. I wanted them to have like salvation. And then when I was even younger I was so scared of everyone going to hell. I was like, oh God, I love Nicole so much. I really don't want her to go to Holland is actually like excuse perience a genuine heartbreak on both and and it's not healthy for either party.	1.0
Yeah, and I think that's something that I would encourage like more Christians to think. about is that like is it possible that these people that do have a good amount of self-worth and that are happy and fulfilled in their life and you know are truly living like enjoy like is it necessary for you to then go and like tear that down to try to like put your belief system on them like you could be causing more her and more harm and I honestly think that that kind of is what happened when I was 12 like I was such a happy The little girl and like that didn't obviously go away overnight, but it was like I didn't necessarily like need these messages that they were telling me and they didn't they didn't help like they didn't make me feel better necessarily but I mean a lot of this like analyzing has come since I've left like, I don't want people to think that like I was miserable for 10 years because I wasn't like I still liked my time as a Christian, but it's just looking back. It's like, I don't know if I would Choose that again.	1.0
Yeah, I mean I wouldn't as same thing for me like at 12. That was when I first was told that I'd be worthless if I had sex before marriage and like you're saying identity wrapped in Christ. My identity was wrapped in my virginity that was definitely an aspect of it as well. Yeah, so like and then when I wasn't a virgin anymore and even when I was married, I didn't know who I was anymore. I didn't know what made me a good. Person anymore because that's all I was like, that's all I heard about. What a good person is a good person is a virgin. Well, yeah. Yeah, it's a disaster. So my Christian advice to anyone in countering any theist or someone that simply doesn't believe the same things or God forbid a Christian that actually believes different things than you two just like trust the Holy Spirit if you believe in God you Proclaim to like believe that Jesus gave us the Holy Spirit puffs. Faith that like everyone is on their own journey and everyone's going at their own rate.	0.0
And if someone's meant to encounter God in a specific way that will be taken care of with or without you harping on the person and actually it's probably less likely to happen if you are harping on the person so just like it's like they could go and they could be showing so much of like, what is it like what day want to like show the person of like if they say that they have God inside of them. It's like are they really showing that because right, you know, a lot of the Christians, you know, people want nothing to do with them because they're so mean and so it's like why would we want your God if like this is what he looks like in my core. I think I fundamentally think we as Humanity are intrinsically good and and I know that like a lot of Christian teaching is that like we're intrinsically evil, but I guess I was just kind of encourage people to step away from I'm like necessarily putting that on all of humanity. Like I don't know. I'm just so positive and I'm so optimistic and like I know there are so many bad things in this world, but I feel like they're always met with like an overwhelming amount of love and support that shows like the goodness of humanity. Like for example, the Orlando nightclub shooting that happened, you know, that was like horrible, but after that Like there were so many people lined up to donate blood and I think just like recognizing that that we are like capable of doing so much good and and focusing on that and then also recognizing that people are so much more than a label like there's so much more than a single word or a single defining term and if we can accept people and like truly accept them. For who they are and not try to change them. I think will realize that it's okay to disagree because those labels don't Define who a person is like I don't Define you by your Christian faith, like you're someone who is fighting for Change and promoting love and acceptance and kindness and equality and those are things that I agree with so if we can focus on what we have in common instead of what divides us, I think, you know, we can you know, Live in a much better world just recognize that the people like your enough like your enough just being you. I don't know like I just feel like like it's in us like we're just good. Well, thank you so much for this conversation. It was awesome.	1.0

This is a very special episode where we have a guest on we recorded in a different way than we usually do. So if it sounds different, that's why please enjoy. Hey everybody and welcome back to another hop up cast today. We have a special guest with us Tina.	1.0
Hello. Hello.	1.0
Nate was away. So I have to play I guess that's not how it goes. So we had we actually we're going to have her on last weekend, but then like this that and the other happened and then the battle pass drop, so it was like, oh it was one thing after another wasn't it?	0.0
Yes, it definitely was but you know now we we can talk about the Battle past two.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah. I mean first off like what were your what were your impressions obviously, you know ours.	1.0
You know, I'm definitely I definitely fall into the group that bought the battle past just to support respawn is their first season. I mean, I am not expecting like Fortnight level battle pass stuff, right? So yeah, I wasn't I was disappointed but I mean, I'm I have high hopes for the season 2. Yeah.	0.0
Yeah, we'll definitely have to see him. Obviously, I've given my I've given my opinion out into separate podcast. I don't want to get too much into it, but it's I can definitely see your point. And I mean that's why at the end of the our last hop up cast. I tried to like kind of Bring It Down be like, all right, guys, you know what? Thanks your thanks respond because I mean we really do mean it. I mean it was super easy for us to be like me happy but instead with you know, we wanted to end it on really good note. So that's that's why we went that way because you know, Of like you it is pretty much just it is pretty much just like supporting respawn and you know saying all right, you know this this one's this one's a given I guess, you know for now because I mean there's not like they can do anything about it.	1.0
Exactly and I think I think a lot more people will be critical of the second season, like hoping that they kind of learn from how the community has provided feedback about the first season because I know I think the consensus overall There's this disappointment and liverworts and I think a lot of people don't like that 20% of the battle pass is just all those badges those number badges that no one's going to use. Yeah. Yeah.	0.0
I think it is the repeating like that's what triggered Nate like it was halfway into that. I still oh my God, I would I took way too much pleasure in it because it was just like it was so funny to see him go there but I think what really triggered him was actually like some of the audio Clips he started listening to him and was like, hey, it's season one and then Bangalore. Hey, it's season one caustic. Hey, it's season one.	1.0
It's like I'm basically it had like all the opening season intro for exactly legend of the bit disappointed. I don't think some of my friends have had a chance to listen to all the audios. I think they'll be up in arms about it. Did they realize that they're just variants of the same same thing?	0.0
Over and over again, but hey now, it's Mina saying it so, you know exactly so I mean, let's let's talk a little bit first before we get into the topic of the week. So how how long have you been playing it to? Have you been playing it from the very beginning?	1.0
Yes. Okay. So a little tip about me I was a big Titanfall 2 fan.	1.0
Hell. Yeah, I think most people are most of the people who are like true gamers.	1.0
It's a good game and I felt so bad for respawn not getting the attention they deserved and I was actually looking forward to Titanfall 3 and I think I was I just happened to stumble over a live stream. That was the day they announced Apex nice. So I downloaded the day came out and I've been playing it since yeah, definitely.	1.0
Yeah. I mean, I feel like that's a lot of people's like I I definitely I think the first time I technically heard of it. Clean prints gaming and he's he talked about it. And he was like, you know, oh, hey, here's the secret project. I think even had the name of that Apex Legends. I don't know if like, I don't know if he knew that it was the real name or whatever. Like I don't know what his sources are but like he was actually talking about the fact that it was going to be a battle or who's going to be a battle royale that it wasn't going to be in the TitanFall Universe. I don't think he said anything about classes. So there was a few things that he got wrong, but that was actually the first time I ever heard of it and I'm like Well, that's kind of cool. I mean, I like a lot of people, you know, love Titanfall 2 and it came out and yeah, it was very much. It was very much the same thing you were saying just like well dang it, you know every they were put to they were put to death by EA and so for for it to kind of turn around into this was probably one of the most amazing things. I mean the little a lot of people kind of already talked about it, but it's just the fact that is like hey, you know this game that we made well, it's already And it's like wait. What?	1.0
Yeah, that was the thing that surprised me because I stumbled over I think it was I was Googling it and I saw Kotaku like they had at this press release that respawn might drop Apex Legends. Like what is this and it they had like Titanfall 3 kind of linked into the article itself. And then when it clicked on live stream, that was when I realized oh by the way guys, you can play it tonight so that yeah, I I didn't I didn't hear about it before the day. At open when did you find out kind of like heard the rumors?	1.0
I want to say it was the week right before it was it was right before like maybe even like the Thursday before it was very close and that some streamers were kind of hinting.	1.0
Yeah before but I like I guess the streamers I were following I was falling but didn't hint at it. But I don't think they were the ones who are playing Apex either the ones you were watching respect the non-disclosure agreement. Exactly.	1.0
I mean yeah, there was definitely some people who leaked it if the clean prints out of all the freaking people, you know, honestly, I don't know about you but I feel like in the last week.	0.0
Everyone's gone. Pretty darn good at the game. Yes, the skill level has shot through the roof. I don't know if it's because the battle pass brought back all the sweat.	1.0
He's that's a good term.	1.0
I feel like that literally like the day the battle Fast Draw Tite. Klodin, I'm like so excited. Like I've got like a decent amount of wins under each with my Legends and I was like, yeah, I'm like, I'm going to like start on this Belfast. I'm going to hopefully end up in top-tier know I was getting slaughtered by people like race with a thousand kills was like Wow, every love you is the champion was a thousand kill rates and and I was just so blown away because the week before that you could have some winners that like probably just started the game. The spike and skill just sawed through the roof overnight.	1.0
Yeah. I mean, I'm actually you kind of make me feel a little bit better about myself because I thought it was just me because literally this is how it happened it came out and I want to say I started the stream because I think it was what was it was either 11 or noon my time. And so I started the stream, of course my wife got off right around the same time, so I had to go get freaking groceries. But I only got uh game in I got a single game in I got two kills which you know for me was actually really cool. But I got I got both of the kills because of the jump at the first was in midair and then the other one was after I had landed so it felt really satisfying and I'm like sweet this is how I'm starting off the season then literally I go grocery shopping. I get home. I get some food for the kids, you know, like shut up go over there and he And then I start my stream again and just out like you said I just started getting slaughtered left and right it was to the point where like high morale was just so low and I'm just like, oh my God, I'm I'm trash I hate this and yeah, I mean like I feel a little bit better knowing that it's not just me that apparently was a lot of people because yeah, that was that was what happened with me. It was so yeah. Oh my God, I felt bad for a couple of reasons. I mean for one, obviously, I have a podcast where or like here's some tips and tricks and how to get kills and so to get slaughtered like that really really puts a damper on your mood. That's number one. But then number two is I'm trying to stream it. So like for anybody heard out there who doesn't know I'm a bus driver and this week happened to be this week happened to be spring break for the Boise school district or so. I'm like, okay, I don't have to go to work. This is awesome. I have a whole week division to Now they're dropping the battle pass. And so I was starting to try to get a little bit of a schedule for my twitch going. And so I started that but I'm doing horrible just absolutely terrible and it yeah, it felt horrible and I'm like the other side of the coin is the fact that it's like well, I'm trying to entertain people but it is so hard to entertain somebody when you're just not having a good time. I mean just losing one after another after another. I was just like okay, this is this deck dad's when I get it.	0.0
Oh, you know, I honestly feel the same way and it's funny because like I met one of my friends that I play on the regular with now and he's so good. Like I really like he's he on average. He talks about a thousand to two thousand damage easily Perfect Choice. Okay, the battle pass happened and we're playing and he's just like, oh my God, everybody's got so much better at everyone same spot on like he can keep up with Sometimes like I've had some bad days. I'm like, you know, what dude I just gotta like a log off anymore and I'm gonna kill the vibe for this party, but it's funny that you brought up the octane jump pad to because I'm so happy that you got this cool trick shot like in the air kill someone I tried doing that and my buddy throws down jump pad and the squad is all like on the other side of this house that we needed to get over and he throws it down he Is he can't he knocks someone like I'm gonna do the same thing. I'm gonna go in there and I'm Gonna Knock.	1.0
Hey, you hold my beer.	1.0
I got this exactly and you know Mike I had a fully kitted are 301 and I had a peacekeeper.	1.0
I emptied a whole clip on this Mirage and then missed the Peacekeeper they've mirages I swear there was two rounds right in a row, but I got killed by a mirage. The first one was because of a decoy right before I started trying to unload them like way too. Second I totally got Bamboozled.	0.0
I didn't get bamboozled. My aim was just crappy when it jumped over that house. That's funny that you pointed that out because my friend plays Mirage and whenever he plays Mirage, it's just like he gets his best games and it's just he's a Slaughters the lobby.	0.0
It's almost like it's almost worse getting killed by our Mirage because you know that his quip is just so cocky.	0.0
Yeah. Yeah, exactly and and you know, like he's actually his his like a Bility is you don't really fall for it too much anymore. Maybe the odd Bamboozled. Yeah, I guess it is, alt isn't that great. But for some odd reason it's always like the mirages are the sweatiest randos. You're gonna get aside from the raids.	0.0
Yeah. Yeah mangalore's to I guess those are like, yeah and I feel like octane is going to become that very very quickly because those are the people who want to go fast and want to just like get around you as quickly as	1.0
Possible exactly that's speed boost like those speed boosts the way it changes the game entirely.	1.0
So let's go ahead. Let's jump let's jump. Let's drop it drop right into our topic of the week, which is ranking the Drop Zones. So we've gone through our characters. We ranked all of them. We even did octane for our last, you know Hub cast. Oh gee and so yeah, I thought like well, Obviously, the next thing we have is our is our Drop Zones so mean you talked about it before we agreed pretty much on everything. We're like, okay. This is a very good order we like it. So let's start with number ten. Number ten is Bunker bunker is is very much. Like we I think we both agreed bunker is very much at the last end of it because it does have some good loot. But then you also have to kind of like cross your fingers.	1.0
Yeah, it's a high-risk high-reward. Yeah, you gotta get the bunker first. If you don't then it might be a little bit of a challenge.	0.0
Yeah, I don't I don't love it. I like it more as like I think like a second place to go to like if I drop near it. I might go there and like okay nobody's been here or somebody has but maybe they had to drop something. I don't know so I don't like it to be my very first drop but every once in a while some of the You know, they'll be the jumpmaster and they'll be like, alright, we're going to Bunker and I'm like, all right, I do have to admit. I had one of my coolest coolest kills there because you have to tell me. Yeah, I dropped into a bunker bunker. I dropped into it. I want to say it was on the west side. So the one with like the kind of the archway or whatever and then the the two or three boxes there so I dropped. On that side and I dropped in a there. There's a bluff Honda. He's right there and I'm like, oh no no, no, she's gonna get me. I mean, I'm dead. I like I like in my mind. I had already given up here, you know, I was like, you know what? I'm not going to go down without a fight. So I just started hitting him hitting him over and over again and they're just like kind of running around like like they're brand new player in the like what's going on what's going on? And so finally a finished him off with a flying kick or whatever then all of a sudden I hear the gunfire from my teammates. Are somewhere else on like okay, I gotta grab something grab something and grab something and then I think I came up behind a couple of people and got them ended up getting knocked a little bit later, but it was like that rush or whatever. That was just like yeah, I'm not going down without a fight and I definitely didn't think it was gonna work because they actually got a gun and so they shot but it was a most home Peak. So the shot three times miss me two of them. So it was kind of crazy so number. Nine is going to be relay and relay. I felt like was a pretty good choice because I really like the wetlands. So whether or not you jump or you drop at Wetlands, like maybe you weren't quite able to get it to relay, but the good thing is that there's that redeploy right there. So regardless of where the circle is with that redeploy dropping there's really cool because you can kind of just take your time.	1.0
Yeah, exactly. And I mean sometimes Relay can be a busy dropped. To so if you if your squad wants to bail just south of it as Wetlands. So here's another area with decent amount of loot. It's just it's a good place. It's a good place to drop for sure and strategically place yourself after definitely.	1.0
Then number eight was Cascades, you know what it was when it started getting down because we actually went from one to ten when we were making the list. So we're getting towards the end of it as like, okay. Well do we want Bridges or Cascades and you shouted out Cascades and I'm like, oh, that's a good point.	1.0
Yeah, it's just a few more houses with a few more areas for loot spawn. I spend sometimes Bridges could be a hit or a Miss. Like you could find a bunch of Shield cells or maybe and a couple of mozambique's and bridges and then other times maybe all you'll run out with decent load out.	1.0
Next one number seven is Skull town which from the map. I'm actually surprised that it's not a purple Landing Zone. I could have swore. The purple zone right think they drop their like it's an orange Zone. Yeah, and I think and I think we talked a little bit beforehand, but I think one of the main reasons why it is such a good drop zone. Is that even though it might not have the best quality gear? It has the most quantity of gear. So you might not get you might not get your purple armor. You might not find like an orange helmet, but you will get a lot of it. So if you do find Shield cores, you're going to find a lot of them. You're going to find a lot of Medics you're going to find some gun and a good amount of ammo and then kind of like our one story about how we got down in this skull town, you know, if you're able to survive that encounter, you can have like a lot to choose from you can have up to like, you know anywhere from 15 to 20 death boxes should be like, what do I want? Oh, this guy had this I'm just going to pick that up that there.	1.0
Yeah exactly and it's funny because well everyone. All it like everyone will know that it's hot Drop. Everyone will drop on the sides and they'll all run into the middle to fight. Yep. So, you know, all 20 boxes will be right in the middle pretty much. Yeah, you can just literally take us like side step to the next death box and help yourself.	1.0
Exactly. Then number six. We got the slums. The slums is probably one of my more favorite ones and it's kind of I think it'd be kind of similar to skull town where you might not be able to get the best quality, but there is a lot Yes, I maybe it's because of all the different buildings and it's similar to skull town. But obviously just slightly different. I do like I almost always go up to the to the places up on the zip line up in the caves. I almost always go there and I'm usually able to find you know decent gear up there. I might not I mean, I might not find like the best obviously but I find some decent stuff up there plus depending on if I'm playing with randos, which is almost all the time. But if I'm playing with randos not a a lot of them think to go up there so we don't have to struggle to get loot.	1.0
You know, what funny thing that you just said that I actually didn't know those houses existed to like about a week ago. We had to bail on Landing in slums just because there's so many people going and then my one friend took us under it's like kind of underneath the waterfall right? Are you talking? Okay? How's this? Yeah, I was like there's places here. So that yeah, like it's definitely a kind of nice little area tucked away. Yeah.	1.0
Now he kind of blew the secret so I know you know we but I do like going up there because I don't I just don't I don't have to struggle as much, you know going from house to house and then having somebody, you know accidentally pick something up or whatever now if they have their mic, I'll definitely yell at them, but they don't always listen so going up. Actually those houses is really nice not having to worry about okay and then not only that but then I can get kitted up enough where I'm like, hey guys, there's a you know, there's armor up here. There's this up here. Yeah, a little bit more support that way so it's really fine armor and shields up there.	1.0
Yeah, that's what I've noticed now that I know it exists and I do all right number five is the swamps.	1.0
I was actually surprised to see this as a purple because much like skull town and much like slums. There's a lot of houses here. So not only is it a lot of houses, but it's also a high tier area. And so this is really good because Depending on if you're the only Squad that lands there and I feel like not a lot of people this is very underrated place.	1.0
It is like I think the hottest time I've ever dropped in swamps was maybe with two other teams. Mmm.	1.0
It's just it's not a place that a lot of people go to I don't I don't and I don't know why I think maybe it's the mentality the mentality is they see the water and they think it slows him down and it does to a certain degree because like you can't slide but it doesn't actually like physically slow you down. And maybe that's what maybe it's just this mental thing where they're like, oh, I'm going to be sloshing through the water. It's like not really I mean even some of like the tree houses because they have boxes up there to even some of the tree houses. You can get some really good loot out of there.	1.0
Yeah, like it's either whenever my friends and I dropped their we all one of us always go leaves with like purple armor. So it's it's really honestly a great place. I feel like it's the moisty Meyer. We're not nice. Yeah something Doesn't hit that part of the island and get rid of swamps, but I don't know it's funny that you said that too because moisty was full of water and people and that's load people down. So maybe people have that mentality about so yeah.	1.0
Yeah, they're they're taking their Fortnight, you know connoisseurs and trying to bring it over here. Like now that stuff doesn't fly all the time. It doesn't come go one to one all the time, you know, and I mean, I think the only thing is like, yeah, you can't really slide as as good but your actual like speed Really isn't affected all and so yeah, I think maybe it is just a mind thing. So we just opened up the floodgates now, it's just going to be like everybody's going there taking vacations. We're good. We ruined it speaking of ruining it number four is the pit. The I think my favorite thing about the pit is nine times out of time then again, if I drop at the pit, my next stop will always be the slums because because of that Redeploy their it is always really good. And I mean no matter where the ring is. The redeploy will get you close enough where you can kind of take your time. So you can you can go all over the pit. You can go all over the slums get to that Secrets place that we were talking about and still have enough time like okay, I better go ahead and hit that redeploy. And then you start going towards, you know, like the what's that bunker called like to the West I mean, it's just like this big kind of Hangs over the mountain kind of hangs over the Cascades and stuff. I don't know what it's I don't know if that's named technically. So it's kind of like what it's just a little bit south of artillery, right exactly that so you can kind of start heading that way you won't make it because there's a little Bridge area but even that bridge area has some decent loot. I mean, I don't think you'll have high tier loot but it is a there's a good little stop there along the way and then even if the circles bearing down on you the the Outer Circle will most likely be somewhere around like Cascades. You know that first or that round to Circle usually will be right around Cascades no matter where it ends up on the on the map so you can make it there. Absolutely. No problem.	1.0
Yeah, I totally agree. I feel like I definitely will have to use that strategy more that in the pit. But there's also something just south of the pit. I don't think it's kind of like a meme on the internet right now. We're yeah gold armor and helmets appear or it's the giving tree of Apex. Yeah, these Supply boxes just outside of this little metal Archway. So pit has gold armor in it or has a higher chance of it, but I don't know if it's true or not. I witnessed it myself, but they have spoken about it and some people.	1.0
You but I believe I believe everything you hear on the internet unless it's that Apex Hub cast is awesome.	1.0
You can totally believe that now everyone's going to drop their too. Darn there goes my gold armor.	1.0
Yep. There you go. Number three is the Thunderdome. I feel like when we were talking about it was like Thunderdome needs to make top three because the Thunderdome it's just fun, aesthetically as far as like the different levels that you have the different buildings you can Weighs almost guarantee a purple and like I'd say anywhere from seven to eight out of ten times. It'll be right in the center. So if you time it just right you can land like right next to it was like yeah purple armor.	1.0
Yeah, we always like me and my friends we always raise for it, of course the octopus octopus, right? But yeah, no, I think Thunderdome it's just so underrated because that's like like swamps. It's not a very Popular spot to land, even though the loot is actually quite decent the number of times. I've walked out with purple armor and Spitfires. Like that's that's and game material.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe it is another mental thing like we were talking about the swamps like it's the Thunderdome. Welcome to the Thunderdome bitch.	1.0
I mean everybody's kind of enticed to go to skull town which is right next door.	1.0
So I know it's it. I don't want to keep making the references but it is very much tilted as Far as like people think that oh, I'm gonna get the best loot here, but it's like no dude just go a little bit Southwest you got something way better Thunderdome is quite literally if you look at the map that we're looking at Thunderdome is literally surrounded by mid-tier things. So if you go to Thunderdome first, you have three different places to choose from that you can still get mid-tier stuff from yeah exactly.	1.0
Like you can get your good guns your good armor a decent amount of Shields and Thunderdome and then you can go to the It's your areas for your ammo afterwards. Absolutely. It's a really good place to drop.	1.0
Yeah, so it had to make it in the top three number two Air Base. I feel like this is probably between this and number one. Obviously, these are my two favorite places. So this was probably the hardest as far as like putting it in the in the list, but air base is just so much fun.	1.0
And it honestly is and the amount of teams that drop their right. It felt like I was just telling you earlier to it's so much fun to punch someone off the side of their face just like this is Sparta. Exactly. Everyone will land in the South part of air base and it'll all be on that Runway with those three crates and we'll just all have a bunch battle. The one Squad makes it all the live.	1.0
Yeah, and I mean, it's just I feel like another reason is I've dropped there so many times now there and there and like the wetlands and things like that. I've dropped so much that I'm so used to the layout of it. I feel like I have that that first like hot Drop if I was going to hard drive anywhere it would be there and then obviously number one but it's like those are the places that I'm so comfortable with that. I feel like I know the angles I know the corners and I really I just like the setup of it and then if you get in a pinch using that zip line across the tooth, you know the to He's or whatever is really nice because you hit somebody just right.	1.0
It's nice to see their body just like a drop down exactly one thing that I learned in one of my games if if you and the opponent is using the zip line and same time going the opposite directions. He will both just Bonk each other and fall to your death. Really? Yeah. That's awesome. I hopped on the zipline and I'm heading over there and this guy like had a gun. I didn't have a gun. I was just going to go over there and just Punch right died but he and I didn't know why I didn't shoot. He just hopped on the zipline and came straight at me and we both like a bumped into each other and fell to her death. So maybe I got the kill so I was kind of happy with that right you like I'll take it.	1.0
I'll take it.	1.0
This is team died. So I you know, I got the kill and I got the respawn so I'm good. That's just to let you guys know if someone else is hopping on that zip line, right? It don't jump fun.	1.0
Well, dude, I mean have faith in your teeth. All right number one, but my favorite artillery is our number one. Yes, and I mean I definitely have to agree. This is this is the other one where I was talking about like hot dropping here isn't that bad? Because I feel like I know the corners I know everything hurt a lot of it, you know.	1.0
Yeah and then the two corridors leading out of artillery. Well that's like a decent amount of loot as well.	1.0
Yeah, and it's definitely the levels as well like the different.	1.0
Evils of the buildings and the bunker on that's built into like the side of the mountain exactly and I and I think like that's the one area that I love how you can play at different levels and regardless of the legend that you are. You're not kind of hindered because you can basically like the walls are low enough that you could mantle right up to the top floor. Yeah, so like it so it's all like if you're a Pathfinder, you've got instant High ground and no one else can come up and get you and plus you got that balloon on the Side so you can yeah, you gonna come back.	1.0
Yeah having the having the redeploy. Once again kind of just means you can kind of take your you could take your time. You don't have to worry too much and you can either go to the redeploy or you can go to that thing just to the South which was the overhanging bunker and then boom there's Cascades right there Cascades is the mid-tier and it also has the redeploy right there. So no matter where even if the circle is going all the way down to like Thunderdome like you can really take your time in that area. I think that's what's so enticing about is no matter where the circle is going. You have you have a couple of avenues that you can go you can go to the read a pulley right there, or you can go down to Cascades kind of get a feel like okay. Has anybody been here and regardless you still got that other redeploy. You got a lot to choose from and I think that's that's probably the main reason. It's number one.	1.0
I I totally agree and I think it's so yeah like the loose just great and all the places that you need to go to. Later, as you're moving towards the circle is just it's perfect. It just lines itself up. Yeah, we're definitely all right.	1.0
So the last thing we'll do is we're going to go into some reader mail. Okay, first up we have Travis. Hey guys and girl with the release of Apex Legends with with the release of Apex. Legends came the inspiration to replay Titanfall 2 campaign upon completion of the campaign. I noticed something pretty interesting in the final mission. There is a huge reference towards Apex Legends. I was dumbfounded the Bounty Hunter that catches you in Titanfall 2 campaign mentions Apex Legends and gives you a and Apex card as a sort of invite to the game pretty cool. This could also eat or this could also even have some relevance on future characters in Apex. Maybe. Could you possibly be Pilot Jack Cooper in Apex or even the Bounty Hunter mercenary General martyr. What are ya'lls thoughts? I mean, we talked a little bit about Titanfall. So I felt like that was a perfect email to bring up. I mean, I honestly did not know that I full disclosure. I'm sorry. I'd actually didn't get all the way through the Titanfall campaign or whatever so I didn't see this but Travis I didn't finish it. It's oh, yeah, I know. II I've always wanted to and it was just one of those things like I think when I happened to pick it up I have to pick it up on a little bit of a sale or something. I didn't pick it up on day one, but I absolutely love the multiplayer and when I play a game and I really really like the multiplayer. It's kind of hard to bring myself to to play the campaign the campaign like really really good example is like a battlefield one. I really like Battlefield ones multiplayer, but the second I went into Campaign and I started to die. I try throwing down a med pack and I'm like, oh, that's right. I can't do that. Yeah, so there was just so many moments like that. I just couldn't get over it.	0.0
I think yeah, I think that's going to be the one thing that's going to be a little bit of a struggle in the type fall to a campaign. Like I was just like you I bought Titanfall 2 on sale like probably 20 bucks. It was yeah, it definitely wasn't on release and bought it for the campaign because my friends were telling me I had needed to play the game but I got caught up in the multiplayer. I think I was playing the multiplayer for a month before I actually decided okay. I'm going to To pick away at the campaign and the campaign honestly is a lot shorter than what you expect. Right? Yeah, you don't have to dedicate too long to it. But the moment I finished that campaign Titanfall instantly became one of my favorite games of all time. Yeah. Yeah, so I don't want to blow the ending and it will hear our kids though. I mean the story itself is probably the reason why a lot of people are a big Titanfall 2 fans, but the whole Apex Legends reference Reference I think that was that's like really really cool. And I know that the I hope that they respond cut it does the same thing they did with Titanfall 2 was they sometimes had a little bit of lore that they would add on to the game in general, but you had to find on the internet in terms of like like scripted cartoons or something, but I hope that they do that with Apex just to give a bit more background to all the characters and I don't know about the whole Jack Cooper Legend to like I would love that. Yeah, but I feel like his ability is might be a bit o p yeah.	1.0
Yeah, there was somebody on on the interweb. I think I want to say was just a couple of days after it came out. They put out one of those like concept Arts of of Titanfall pilot. And so I want to say like the passive was the passive was double jump. I think they're know the passive was the passive was wall running. I think oh gosh. we'll jump was in there somewhere and then I can't remember what the can't remember the Oldham it is and I'm like, you know, I think that could be the only way that like a straight-up pilot could make its way into it is that if the clinic call in the Titan and then that kind of defeats the purpose of it, but to have a character who could like double jump or whatever that yeah, that could kind of be like a grappling hook or a jump pad in a sense that you know, hey, I'm just going to double jump and as long as that was like his passive and it wasn't like Then you had to like recharge on I don't know that could be kind of cool. I mean, I feel like they're definitely need I feel like they're definitely needs to be like maybe a stamina bar on it so that you could have just double don't double jump double double double double double.	1.0
Exactly. Well, that's the one thing I was kind of fearing was like cause you played a bit of the multiplayer to you kind of got you you kind of got them familiar with some of these people who are like Titanfall veterans where they were grappling and then once they got like to a certain speed you basically could just go around the map by sliding and sliding and jumping over and over and never losing speed and every time you do you use the grapple, right? So exactly like I think that would make it pretty hard for Apex just because time to kill is just so much slower in Apex and if someone's moving that fast it might be a little bit difficult true true about it.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah the wall running. I feel like I don't think is there were there are certain parts that I've noticed. It's like okay, here's this pipe for instance and it has this flat surface on the side of it now granted you couldn't mantle that but it's like it how long it is unlike this kind of seems like they have real running in it and they just they took it out because exact there's some parts on the map where I'm like that that is clearly a wall running wall, but for some reason it's here and it's just taken out or something. I would like it limited time event. I'll be honest. I'd like it limited time. We're like while running and All jumping we're just you know, everybody had it. You know, I feel like that would be really cool. And I mean maybe even maybe even for solos, you know, if we get solos because the main reason at least this is from the developers themselves the main reason they took it out was because it encourages people to split up but if we're doing solos we don't have to worry about splitting up it would be kind of cool to wall run.	1.0
That would be cool. I wonder it to how the Legends would work in solos no abilities.	1.0
I also Find out till the day I die bunch of Pilots running around. I mean, I feel like they need to just have a generic looking person or you can choose your Legend. You just don't get the abilities because I just imagine everybody choosing Bangalore everybody choosing wraith or everybody choosing octane for that matter. Yeah, because having that, you know regenerating health or whatever would be really nice. And so I feel like that'd be the only well I guess without the abilities you wouldn't have the great generated. Never mind.	1.0
I'm stupid, but	0.0
I feel like that's the only way you can make it work and not feel because I mean especially if you think about Gibraltar and Bangalore for that matter, they have airstrikes and if you just happen to be a person all by yourself and you're getting are striked, that would be frustrating as hell.	0.0
Exactly. So, yeah, I don't know how they would be able to incorporate like all the wall running and just and the island itself there certain areas that aren't made for all of that running. But I mean at the same time I wouldn't be too choked if they decided. So they could limit I'm like game just to just to have like a fast-paced does a fast paced around where it's like yeah, we're constantly moving.	0.0
Yeah, I think that'd be cool. Like the a blitz around like some of the other battle rifles have had for the circle just keeps moving.	1.0
So you're forced to keep running around.	0.0
Yeah. I think that'd be really cool. I think it would be really cool.	1.0
Oh, I was just going to ask you to like, what do you think about Titans? I know that they had in there like a some in their file. Files they had tried it and they said it didn't work. But but it always keeps getting Revisited on the internet the people like what if it's like the end game where they drop Titans or something like what's your perspective on it?	1.0
I like that idea for the in-game. So it's like the last squad or something and I can't remember what episode it was, but we did bring up Titans in the fact that like what if it was I think it was actually it was our first reader mail and somebody somebody had brought up like It was something like evolve. We're like there was one person on each squad or there. You know, there is they tweak the numbers so that basically it was kind of like evolved in the sense that you had to hunt down this Titan and kill it and I think something like that or something, where's this super rare item? And then you'll be able to call it in but you have to go to like certain spots to call it in the you can't just like have it call in anywhere. Yeah, I mean because once again, I hate to compare it to Fortnight, but when Fortnight has like it's Thanos limited time run. I mean, I don't see why you couldn't just have this nice little limited time thing. You have the Titans. It makes people happy, but then I guess the other problem with that. Is that what if it makes it better exactly.	1.0
I agree with you that I think it should be like, I think they should revisit it for a limited time think Jessica. Test and see I think it'd be so cool to have like let's say the last three squads or something and then like a Titan drops and of course, you know, like the squads are going to run for the Titan. Yeah, because I think a lot of people who are against it and saying that a Titan might be too overpowered also doesn't realize that in Titanfall them if you're a pilot and you're not in the tighten your number one like your number one goal is the mantle that tighten and pull that battery out. The Titan is like dead within a couple seconds, right? Yes, like it would it would be testing it would change the gameplay. I love it. I would like it but I could see how people who might not be much of a Titanfall fan prior to Apex would be overwhelmed with a total of those people exist who played Apex without knowing about and it's playing Titanfall. I mean the player base is so much. Oh, that's a good point. I think they're really the last time they announced a milestone was like 50 mil. Yeah, right they like that. So I Like that definitely it wasn't what Titanfall 2 clocked but but who knows? Yeah, I mean, I feel like it would just it would just be nice just to have it and the game up a little bit so that it doesn't get into that kind of repetitious Lumpur has something people can look forward to that like old fans would be really excited for I think for sure.	1.0
Yeah, it could be like this version or this Games version of like the iron Banner for 10 cents. Yeah. Yeah. We're just comes around every once in a while people get to be a excited about it. Yeah, it just kind of gift you something to be psyched for. Yeah, I think I think it's very cool.	1.0
I think like, you know, like the whole like that whole Thanos Gauntlet thing in Fortnight, even though it was very overpowered and yeah read about it. It was and it was a short period you so of fun even if you got killed in three seconds when he lets someone who's that? Oh, that's right. So if so, I wouldn't even mind if I got killed by typing in a couple seconds if I could just have the chance to like fight for	0.0
Food part way through the game part of me does want to try out the new Firestorm for Battlefield because I do kind of want to see like, how are they going to how are they going to handle Vehicles? Because even though like the high-tier like armored vehicles, you have to go to like a specific spot on the map and then you have to work together. And if you work together from the way it sounds is that if you work together, you get the doors open faster and therefore you can get inside. But I would like to definitely see how they do it because if they can figure it out and then you know, obviously it's ETA. So like if they can figure it out and then maybe Titanfall kind of, you know looks over their shoulder and be like, okay, maybe tighten its can work together and try to make like add it to Em are br-2. I mean cause baby you could be like a bunker type situation where you have to go to very specific part of the map. I think they have to work together, you know anything	1.0
I think how you've kind of raised it to it. It works really well because the whole game tries to force you to play like a team and effective and to work together to be able to start up this Titan or unlock it or you know that kind of thing and knowing that it's at one specific location. So it's not going to be like it's going to be obviously a hot Drop. I think teams will like multiple teams will aim for it. So you'll have like that hot battle outside of that Titan, so it'll be interesting and and I'd have never played.	1.0
A battlefield and yeah, well Firestone, but yeah Firestorm like we were talking about it on our Discord. So hey go to this Garden check out our Discord and have a conversation with us go to our link go to our Discord. Make sure you stay who you are. Because if you don't have the same username, I'll just really who's this girl 2. Yeah, but on Discord, we kind of talked we kind of talked about it on Discord in the sense that like probably my only problem. Like what I've seen of Firestorm actually looks really good and I'm like, okay that looks pretty cool. But there's one key problem about Firestorm and that's that I would have to buy Battlefield 5.	1.0
Yeah, that's like you pay it's kind of like it's kind of like Call of Duty and blackout. Yeah, basically had to pay for yeah the arm portion right?	0.0
So I don't mean I even I like Battlefield I've liked it for a while and it's one of those things that you know, one thing that I always. He's whenever I start up Apex Legends. There's always that like millisecond where I'm like, oh, yeah, that's right. EA also does this and I'm like crap. I'm supposed to hate them. Darn it.	0.0
Why do I love them so much.	1.0
I'm like a battered girl and I'm just like, why do I love you? Because I mean like in general like Battlefield. That's the only reasonable not only reason I mean, there's plenty of reasons, but that's like one of the only reasons I didn't buy Battlefield 5 is the fact that EA has Been doing some really questionable things in the past. And I mean, I tried the beta out for Battlefield 5 and it was very much like okay, this is more Battlefield and it wasn't a bad thing necessarily. It's just that like when I looked at that plus all the other things coming out around it. I was like that $60 just ended up going somewhere else now technically now, I think I could probably end up picking up on like a really good deal or something, but then that's still like money that I'd have to put towards that instead of something.	0.0
Else and it's just like like and then the thing too is like well, you don't know how the games like how the modes going to play right?	0.0
Exactly might be janky like a might be janky or Vehicles.	0.0
Yeah. And so you bought your by this game and then you'll play the BR and then you'll realize like, oh, it's not a smooth running. Let's say its apex like right off the get-go, right? So, I don't know. How do you feel about the fact that EA is dropping another BRC one of its biggest VR is right.	0.0
Now that's the yeah, that's that's confusing. I mean cuz it's almost like a Titanfall 2 situation. But now it's Battlefield that's Battlefield has turned into the TitanFall 2 of the of 2019 because it's like who's going to be playing. I mean, I'm sure there's millions of people who picked up Battlefield 5 and they might even still have it on their fan base for sure.	0.0
Yes. Yes 5, yeah.	1.0
I mean there's still a lot of people out there, but I just wonder how many are still. attached to it enough where they're like, okay, I mean, this is obviously a marketing thing where locate their they're releasing it so that they can get their people back but I'm wondering other than the people who have already bought it other than the people who have already been enjoying Battlefield 5 who really wants to get Battlefield 5, it's just for the Battle Royale because I've been I've been preaching it from the heavens that like Pub G like I could technically play that now I could go on my PlayStation I could Pay the money to buy our to purchase it or exactly download it but then I have to pee I have to pay money. It's like right now I have H1Z1 which is very similar. I know there's going to be tons of people out there who want to be like well actually but H1Z1 very similar you have realm Royale, which is nice. I didn't absolutely love it, but I liked it you have Fortnight and now you have Apex. Why in God's name would I spend money on pube G? Just play something that I'm really already playing in a better version and I know like like well, how do you know you've never played it? But I know I know. Yeah, you just know in your heart.	0.0
It's actually like it. You don't have to desire to pay for it and play it. That means that like you ready finding that Phil somewhere else. So I think I don't know.	0.0
It's interest Ari. I know you're a lady, but that was sort of a giggity.	1.0
Hey I go and listen you did that's the episode or not. But you need to like it just like a little a little blooper at the end find easy like free stuff out there. Why would you why would you spend money on this? And then the fact that it's EA once again doing this to itself like I don't I don't understand exactly the business model behind dropping similar games at similar times.	0.0
It's yeah, it's they're trying to saturate the market that's always kind of been there thing, which is also the one of the main reasons. I didn't want to buy Battlefield 5 because it's like it's they've been trying to saturate the market so much which is also like one reason I'd be kind of scared for Apex because it's like, you know how much now that now that it's making money because let's admit like one of the reasons EA didn't give a crap about this game beforehand is because they didn't believe in it, but now that it's making money. I'm scared for respawn because how much are there going to start trying to manipulate you spawn and like I was actually talking with Nate and just wasn't on air. I don't think but I was actually talking to Nate and I was like, you know, well like $18 for a skin that's ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous. It's a gun come on and I wondered to myself now respawn obviously stated that EA had no hand in making the game, but when it comes to the monetization how much of a hand is he a hat?	0.0
Pain that I feel like they have a significant influence on like the pricing side of things right? It's because that's what I'm wondering the operation, right? So in declaring company the parent company kind of controls the dislike the monetary side of you think any company or like any of the subs, right? So I feel like it's definitely an EA thing like even with a discount like the if you have like EA access origins or whatever you can get 10% discount, but even then that's like still a lot of money. Yeah. Spend on a gun skin that you probably won't be using for the full game. I think that they'd still I think that they need to kind of drop the price a little bit if they want to make more but did you hear that? They made apparently 92 million dollars. Yeah before the battle path. I was like who's buying stuff in the store?	0.0
I wasn't I mean I bought all admit. I bought $10 so that I could have 10 loot boxes, but I bought loot boxes. I never have bought a straight-up skin. So I'm Wondering how many people are like me I would like to I would like to see some kind of a breakdown of the analytics. Like how many people are really like the Mastiff for instance. I love the like, I think it was called The Warp Zone or something, but it pretty much look like a Nintendo controller and even have like Megaman on the screen or whatever but it's a Mastiff. You don't always get a Mastiff, but if you get like an R3 or re 99, you could get that every round if you really tried exactly right so	1.0
I don't know. I don't know who spends on gunskins maybe character skins but even then I don't really I like I don't really see a lot of I like it being a surprise personally, you know, like I like I like what for instance yes like to have definitely pulls you in for sure.	1.0
Yeah. I mean like for instance I bought the $10 and I got a legendary. I got a legendary Banner. Oh my God poor blood Honda. She had like the snake the snake one. So I really like that one. So any time I'm black Honda I get to have that and it's really cool. And then the other one was the G7 Scout. I got the Gold Dragon one and so like that but like I don't know how much that feeling would be towards something that like I bought it on purpose like having that. I mean, I'll God I'm speaking right to the I'm speaking right to the British people who are trying to outlaw loot boxes, but that feeling when I got as a surprise was really nice because I didn't spend 18 effing dollars on its so having it this Nice little surprise while it boom orange. I'm like, oh, I like this, you know, yes and I have to admit that that was part of what made it nice if I had to spend $18 on a gold dragon.	1.0
I don't think I would have now even talked about it in the skin, but I was like, I really really like it but I don't know they'll spend 20 bucks on this gun skin. It's a little bit of a stretch to be on. Yeah, we don't use the G7.	0.0
Yeah, that'll definitely fix it for you. So, I mean we definitely Definitely stretch this out to a good-sized episode. Now. I feel like you know, there's we had a really good conversation. I definitely like to have you on again if you're able to yeah, and I'll definitely look into better gear not crackling too much. Oh, no, you sound absolutely fine.

I have 12 years experience working in a VA with children with ASD. I thought I knew a lot however after attempting the Beast few times with no avail, I have been humbled I found myself built-in pigeon-holed into one small area of a ba in Wind taking the test. I realized that one area isn't all they test you on listening to the two of you used terms frequently and functionally has helped me so Thousands of dollars on exam prep materials but never got as much out of them as I have listening to real life examples of Behavioral principles. I'm actually excited to sit this month extremely grateful Angela a men. I'm so happy. We've it fired up you to be excited about this exam because it shouldn't be aversive and if you shift your mindset and think of it in these real life principles that we try to bring to you guys every week with fun week new bring it every week. No offense we do Casey and when erect you on the spot, but we have been doing it every damn week. Can you believe that? How did this happen? I mean, I think it's formed a habit at this point after 21 times. I mean, I'd usually 21 days for have it but like it's 21 days kind of I mean whatever like we make this happen. So I just want everybody to know that I accidentally scheduled this trainer. I have to work out with today and she's she does this thing to like hold you into the contingency like if you cannot Make it you still have to pay I was like I'm doing a podcast. She's like, can you treat our training sessions like your podcast because I literally just paid her to do it and I'm here with you guys. I mean, I'm not mad that I'm not working out. It wasn't intuitive. You'll get what I mean. Anyways, let's get started today's episode. I'm really excited because we have a guest who I absolutely adore and whenever I talk to her I feel so Zen. She's so cool my Great friend. I got to live with her for a year. And when I tell you all about her going to be jealous that I got to live with her for a year and our guest today is yell. Guden. She is a professional plant-based chef. And yeah, she was in vegan and culinary school when we lived together. So I got the sample everything and certified life coach who's now pursuing her master's degree in nutrition from the natural University of natural medicine and Portland, Oregon. That is most Fitting Place for her. I'm so happy. She's found. Her right environment. Yeah, L believes. We each possess the inherent wisdom necessary to take necessary to take responsibility for our own health and well-being. She empowers her clients to reconnect with their intuition. Listen to their bodies and find a more joyful and enriching relationship with food so they can stop looking outside of themselves for how to honor their Wellness needs and instead becoming their own best health Advocates. Let me add in a little informal introduction for Yale. Yeah L is cool. Cool AF he like looks really cool in case you guys want imagine. I'll post a pic of her. She has like this little nose ring. She's all natural. I mean this girl legit makes her own cashew milk. I mean like if she's out of milk, please follow her on her Instagram at what does it empowered plate and powered palette and oh my God empowered palette and that is death going to be on the show notes. Yeah. Well welcome.	1.0
Hello. Thanks for having me super stoked pleasure.	1.0
Love to You hear? Yeah, looks like I finally get to hang out with you. Yeah, when I lived together in Austin, it was perfect. I actually lived with Yell sister Talia in University of Maryland in college. And then I was moving to Austin after to follow a boyfriend. I didn't end up with and old days, right? Yeah all days good times. Yeah, and talia's like my sister's moving their you should totally live with her and I thought I was going to be living with this sorority chick and she was not let me tell. Tell you she is like an earthy vegan if I accidentally didn't recycle something you would think the world was going to end and she was like catch me eating like Twizzlers and stuff and be likely I why you have a healthy alternative. Let me cook you up some I don't even know what she would make. I mean these smoothie Bowl she'd make in the morning, but I got access to all of this because I was living with her. I mean it was the coolest year of my life.	1.0
We got did have to hide her candy from me though and eat in her car.	1.0
I like we have bags of Twizzlers are Twizzlers. Kosher. Yes. The question they are Kosher or else I wouldn't be representing them. Okay, they are I just want to double-check keep you on track hold you accountable. Thank you so much. So for today's episode, I think it's really interesting. And yeah that I miss anything about you before I keep going.	1.0
No, I think I think you got most of it summed me up.	1.0
Well, you can find UL in a local Whole Foods you can find her. Her in a yoga class. You can find her where else can we find you Farmers like Brian Kramer's Market buying crystals. Basically. Yeah look up someone from Portland and I think you could find you out. Right but she just moved there actually for school. She was an Austin before which is also keeping it weird. So she's across the board. Yell is so cool. All right now for today's topic, I think it's really interesting and I dropped the subject to Casey and Casey seemed AF about it too because I know there's a lot of talk about it and a lot of people I think don't know what it is. And today we're going to be talking about intuitive eating and the behavioral principles will cover today are deprivation verse satiation food as a reinforcer Mo Sun condition reinforcers maintenance operant behavior self-management and response effort. So yeah, well, can you tell us what the hell is intuitive? Eating based on what it sounds like I was like I'm into this but tell us all about it.	1.0
Yes. Absolutely. I agree with you. It's kind of like a Hot Topic right now that a lot of people might hear and not know specifically what it is. So to break it down intuitive eating is a nonlinear approach to health and food and your overall well-being where the fundamental belief is that you are the expert of your own body. And so The traditional Health realm where we're constantly told to look outside of ourselves at the latest, you know Health Trends and gurus and food rules. What's good for you? What's bad for you intuitive eating asks that you actually just tune into the unique messages your body sends you and determine what is best for your health based on what you feel in your own body. So it's going to be different for every single person and again because you are the expert of your own body. Nobody can decide better than you what you really need. It's also a system that really helps restore a more empowered enjoyable and peaceful relationship with food and your body as opposed to having you work against and fight your body all the time and guys.	1.0
This is if you think about this, this is like private events, right? This is what happens inside your own skin your own verbal Behavior what you tell yourself what you are thinking in your head? Relate it back. Behaviourally a little bit more is like this. These are things that are happening right in your own skin, and you need to pay attention to them. Exactly. So wait, I like like this can we eat whatever we want if you do intuitive eating like so I could have the Twizzlers now. Would you give them back to me now?	1.0
I would actually allow you to have those Twizzlers now and there is an interesting reason why because intuitive eating believes that when you put foods off-limits like when you create hard rules about what you can and can't have what's happening on a on a instinctual level as that, you're just actually creating a stronger desire to have I've got food, right? It's like the classic kid with the cookie jar situation. Look what happens when Mom leaves and the cookie jar is now unguarded right like the kids will try to eat as many as possible in order to like load up before Mom gets back.	1.0
So with the Twizzlers, I found like you a hundred percent. I'd be like nails on hell. Yeah bust out the Twizzlers. I am and the Sour Patch Kids you were in an establishing operation Leon, right? You're like at motivation the value increased so much for those things because you weren't allowed to have them.	1.0
It's like when you go all weak and psychos just letting you have access to the Twizzlers and eat them whenever you want without making like a rule around it then maybe you wouldn't have felt the need to like, you know load up on your car when I was away for the weekend.	0.0
Exactly. Well, I also think that's a common state of behavior. Like we could put this behaviorally into deprivation right when you deprive Yourself as something then how much more do you want to write? Like you're like, I can't be having this now. That's all I want. Right? I mean that's how it works. I mean it's even a simple as like don't think of a pink elephant now don't you want the Pink Elephant the think in your head so like I see how this works. Also. I assume when you're trying to stick to all these diets and like you create these contingencies if I'm only gonna reward myself when I do this for how many days I mean Casey what's one of the I feel like you've done like Whole 30? Yeah. Definitely. I've done probably everything and Whole 30. I actually thought was pretty good to just figure out if you had any sensitivities and I don't know if I'm that is something that you see But like eliminating like the top kind of things from your diet just to see if it does affect you right and then slowly reintroducing it. I like that style. But again, you are you're limiting yourself so you can't have carbs can't have gluten. So then guess what? All you freaking want is a pizza, right? Like you're like, I can't have it like, oh my God right versus that open flexibility or the psychology the psychological flexibility of being like I can have it if I want it does it? Serve my body right now. Is it going to make me feel good? Do I know the consequence of when I eat pizza? I feel sluggish. I may have you know, some Diet, you know some potty issues. So yeah, I like I love this is great.	1.0
And I'm just curious Casey like when you went off the Whole 30 what happened in your relationship with those foods that were then off-limits.	1.0
So I think my biggest takeaway from that. Was that putting food in your body that's going to actually energize you. And make you feel good. So fueling your body with food that is going to produce energy. So you didn't go back to eating pizza dough. I loved a literally pizza every day. That's the place.	1.0
I love what you said because so to answer your question from earlier like a lot of people think okay. If I if I ditch the diet mentality, which I'll name as the first principle of intuitive eating. eating is stepping away actually from those diets from the strict rules about what's quote-unquote good or bad for you and instead giving yourself permission to include all different types of foods in your life in a way that promotes balance and you know, just Variety in general so To answer the question. Can I eat whatever I want? It's like yeah, you can you can eat whatever you want. But if you truly are in tune with yourself and listening to your body, as you said Casey, I would I would imagine and I've experienced and I know a lot of people I work with have experience that you do want to eat more foods that make you feel good because when you are connected to how you feel after certain foods, you're less likely to just eat, you know foods that drain that energy or that make you feel Early tired sure, you're going to eat them sometimes but I think people have this idea that like if I didn't have this super intense discipline around what I ate, I would just like, you know stock up on french fries and Twizzlers all day and I think we need to give ourselves more credit than that.	1.0
Wait. Yeah. I have a question. Yes your his question. So okay. Yeah L was like the vegan Queen does this mean if your body is telling you that you need a milkshake now, you'll drink it.	1.0
I think I would I mean I still hold certain ethical beliefs around veganism. So I would go for a vegan milk shake but that reveal a secret one time yelled. Oh God.	1.0
She's like this is like literally the most is like me telling everyone that she like slept with 73 people in one night. But like for Yale's standards she got really drunk and I had ice cream in the in the freezer. Like I had like a full like it was also like not just like a Ben & Jerry sighs it was Like a devil's eyes one because it was like a TV brand or something and I come the next morning and it's completely gone and I'm like, huh and I'm like y'all did you eat this? She's like no, I'm like, yeah. We're the only ones in here like it was not me last night. Like I did you eat this and you're like, oh my God, I'm freaking out. I don't remember like I was so drunk and I'm like you ate that and she was like freaking out and like could not believe she had Dairy but obviously her intuition was telling her that she needed that ice cream right then.	1.0
Well, it's actually interesting that you bring that up because you know, what is what is one thing that alcohol is famous for write it like it relates to our inhibitions, right? So clearly I was feeling deprived of like ice cream or whatever. It is something sweet. And so as soon as I remove those inhibitions, I felt the compulsive need to eat the entire gallon of ice cream happy.	1.0
I'm happy you went all out. Like if you're going to break something like do it, right, you know, like not like a chocolate totally.	1.0
No, not like a single chocolate chip, but that's another thing about intuitive eating is that a lot of people like kind of swing back and forth from these extremes of being really strict with their diet and then kind of saying like fuck it and just I broke the diet. I'm gonna go all out and eat all my favorite things and maybe eat more of them than I really want to but it's that mentality of going between extremes that actually creates a lot of Shame and guilt around food rather than just like mop, you know, like enjoy All of the different types of foods you're craving in in smaller doses are in moderation and legalizing them in your day-to-day life. So you don't feel the need to like eat the gallon of ice cream. You can just have you know a serving at a time.	1.0
Yeah, like your veiled my biggest secret.	1.0
It's a secret you exposed me.	0.0
So embarrassed right now. It's one of those things like I found myself doing a lot. I'll go all week. I'll fast like, you know till like 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon and then, you know eating really healthy. Dinner and then Friday comes and it's like gung ho Pizza Sushi Chinese food, like wherever Wings blue cheese like come on bring it on because I was good all week and I think about and you could probably you're the expert but what that does to your metabolism. I mean it has to affect it. You're not neutral neutralizing or giving nutrients to your body.	0.0
Totally. Yeah, and so what happens and it's interesting that you know, you all speak so much about like deprivation and I'm curious to hear the connection. But like when you when you go through that process of whether it's fasting or just restricting your calories in some way even if you don't think you're restricting your calories, but to your body like your body doesn't actually know if that's intentional that you're on a diet or you're trying out some new fasting Trend or if you're literally like experiencing food insecurity or a famine. So on the weekend as soon as you are around abundance with Food or as soon as you like loosen the reins on the tight grip of your eating habits, your body is also kicking up your Cravings your hunger hormones your metabolism to try to compensate for that missed caloric energy that you missed out on. So again, it's like it's not even Something That We're consciously doing but as soon as your body believes that you're that you have access to food again, it will send you into overdrive to try to make up for that loss.	0.0
In this would be phylogenic. Would it not in terms of Casey in terms of am I using that? All right. Yeah. It's an honor can't unlearn but I think a problem is that we need to remember also just talking behaviourally for a second it remember food is Food Water oxygen sex Jinx, of course, we both say that one believe activity. These are all unconditioned reinforcers like you are born from day one known as to teach you these things are valuable to you, right? You are born from day one saying okay. This is like this is something that I like write it maintained your behavior if you cried and you got food. Wow, I'm going to cry more. I'm going to get food again. So this happens but what we've set up is and this has been that we naturally need we've created this idea that food should be are like reinforcer for doing something like oh, yeah, I I started with my pajamas today. I went to the gym today now I get to eat right or like I starved myself six days out of the week. Now. I can go ham and put every single thing that I like could have spread out them across the entire week into one weekend or you know, and I think that like, I think that Maybe Society has also shaped the way that we look at Food whereas it should be something that is like you need. This is a human need is really I marry yeah, these are primary and unconditioned reinforcers. You need it and we're looking at it as that's our reward, right? Like how many people are like, I mean, I remember just yeah, I'm sorry. I mean not I'm sorry. I meant I'm sure you remember and yells also going to be embarrassed. I mentioned this. But your sorority days back before you were this hippie chick like you always were this girl at heart but I'm saying I remember even talking about it with you. Like how many girls would go the entire week not eating anything just so they could get super drunk on like and go. What was it Big Slice?	0.0
Yeah. Oh, yeah the jumbo slice.	1.0
Yeah by the bars after yes like, yeah, they go all weak not eating. Yeah, I mean but this is what's normal and it's normalized and it's reinforced and you look hotter in that skirt. You're wearing to go out to the bars that night or whatever it is. But or that's how they feel and I just think that people are using food as a reinforcer when it like something they need to work for where it should be something that they have.	1.0
In their natural everyday life totally like how off you know, it's so normalized like how often do you hear people say I need to burn this off or I need to like work out so that I can go to brunch even here in like Fitness classes. A lot of Fitness instructors will use terms like, you know burn it to earn it and it's just like do you say something L. I actually do because I obviously am very strongly opinionated about this and it's really harmful because not everybody is there to like learn Our food and why can't we just enjoy moving our bodies without feeling like we need to compensate for food? It's like I don't ever have to think about needing to compensate so that I can take a breath or like use oxygen which is another just physiological need but why is there all of this language around food as if it's something we need to earn when it's like your body just requires food and you don't need to earn or compensate for your food and anyway, and that mentality is what's so damaging not even really the the food itself. I'm I love this.	0.0
So this is not a weight loss strategy. It is not a weight loss strategy absolutely know what would you describe it as a lifestyle?	1.0
I would describe it as I want to say lifestyle, even though I don't love that term. It's just a new mentality or a new approach to being in your body, you know, so I have also seen as intuitive eating has become friend here, like people advocating intuitive eating as like the diet where you don't diet and that's so counterproductive to the point of being because it's not a diet and in fact, you cannot practice intuitive eating while also trying to control or intentionally lose weight because as long as you're doing that as long as you are if you can't do it with Weight Watchers, for example, no, Like you like even though they say with Weight Watchers, you could eat whatever you want, but I'll keep ya as long as you're following externalized rules about what you should be eating and tracking your numbers and and having fear around going past a certain point. You'll never be able to actually tune into your body to tell you how much food you really need to feel satisfied. So intuitive eating separates out weight from your health and and really believe that you can be Healthy and you can focus on just practicing Health behaviors without feeling the need to control your weight and that your weight actually is not indicative of your health status.	0.0
Can you do that is so true. I'm reading some things that she sent. Yeah, the body diversity and like the notion that we all have unique genetic Blueprints and the idea around like a scent set weight Point.	1.0
Yeah. So, you know, we all there are several things that impact a person's weight. But really it comes down to like your jeans your environment and and your lifestyle right? So We think that we have we tend to think that weight is something that we have a lot of control over and that we can change our weight at any point that we decide to and that and anybody who's been on a diet before knows that that's not actually it's not actually that simple. It's not like you just do the diet you lose weight and then you never look back. In fact, you know what tends to happen as soon as you go off the diet if either of you like feel comfortable here, whoop, you gain it all back.	1.0
And you know what like in the scale Fox right so much to you could wake up in the morning having not eaten anything and weigh a certain way and then add in the afternoon you go weigh yourself and you are to 7 pounds heavier or you you know, haven't Peter poop jet. So your this much like the number on the scale. I mean again, it's focusing on what makes you healthy right?	1.0
Great. And like the reason that number goes back or the reason, you know, your weight comes back. And in fact, there are studies that show that in only like less than five percent of people can sustain intentional weight loss after a period of dieting meaning that 95% of the time and after a period of one to three years post diet you're going to gain that weight back and the reason why is because your body wants to be at a state of homeostasis, which means that it's keeping things at you know, your your internal set point of what is a normal and healthy weight for you and that number is different for different people based off of your Or metabolism your genes your culture so many lifestyle factors. So it's not that simple to just think. Oh, I you know, I'm going to go on a diet. I'm going to lose this weight and it's just going to stay off your body has so many complex mechanisms and Pathways to actually restore that weight that it wants you to be at and there's a reason it wants you to be at that weight and that weight is different person to person. So, you know, if you think that just adopting your favorite like And influencers diet and nutrition and fitness habits is going to allow you to have that person's body. It's just not because you have a completely different DNA blueprint than them.	0.0
Right? And I think it's interesting because first of all like a Navy a how we have to have like an individualized plan for every person based on their needs whatever it is, but that and also it makes me think of when we talk about validity and as we know validity is the idea is something NG men measuring the relevant Dimension that you intended to measure so right so like I might be like, oh my God, she is so healthy. She's so skinny. Right? Like I'm thinking that they're right her body looking a certain way that that indicates that she's healthy, but that's not really a valid measurement. Right? Like that's not valid if I'm measuring someone's like level of Health. However, you plan on measuring it it wouldn't be there skinny. Like when I think about it after I was hospitalized and so sick. I lost 25 pounds. I felt sexier than ever. But I was at my most unhealthy point of my entire life. I mean, you know, like everything was wrong with me. And so, you know to try measure like, oh she must be healthy. She lost 25 pounds. She's so on her shit, right? Like little did they know my fingers are falling off in the background or whatever is going on that. I'm sorry. I had c-diff or you know, like your body is completely out of whack at that point. So I think that's an interesting site on validity in terms of what we think measures. Health or what? We thinks measure someone having their life together or you know, and it's not actually that at all.	0.0
Absolutely. Yeah, like we live in this culture that prioritises and validates thinness over any other measure as as far as indicating your moral character and also your health status when really the two are are not as connected as we think and I think you put that so well lie out like I think We all know someone who's just naturally thin and eats whatever they want and never go like your sister could look like that.	1.0
My sister's tiny to actually but look, yeah L sister literally like was a model she is so beautiful and like literally, I mean she does eat healthy, but I do think like even if she I mean in college, never mind, no, she used to like eat full takes drunk at night and like look at that person.	0.0
That's just like they're naturally thin but we can't wrap our Mind around the fact that some people the same way are not exactly have a larger body and it's not anything to do they could be a much healthier eater and they might have a way more, you know, regular exercise routine and it just doesn't it doesn't mean that their body will change but you can't look at somebody and know what their health status is you can't tell what they're like metabolic markers of Health are or how off you know, how strong they are. We just can't tell.	1.0
I just want to read something that I pulled off your Instagram which I love Yeah, an intuitive eating tip. Okay, guys. Hey Doodles are stocking for us anything deeper than base level that you provide us. Casey will find I might know why I think I should have been a private investigator in my past life. I shagged stalker. Anyways, actually just reviewing the records like you had have to do an assessment, right? Yeah. I'm just reviewing the records they all right. She says order the salad if that's what you want what you're craving. Being in the moment, but don't consistently order the salad because you think you should or you think that's a good choice. Right? So like you're saying if you feel like it in the moment and you want it do it, but don't do it based on. Oh, I have to have a salad, right that's part of the diet. And that's kind of talking about MO is Casey if you know what I mean in the moment, right like you have certain things that in one moment. What are a mosrite a mozar when we talk about kind of the background information that Either increases or decreases the value of a certain reinforcer a Punisher in that moment. What do I mean? Okay. So let's say like my body is in a state of deprivation of having anything healthy in a while. Like I've just been on a at a tailgate all day eating crap in my body. That's the background information, right? So in that moment, that's the mo right like a salad or some things in establishing operation from my body is wanting that right. So that's what I'm going to have right then. But on another day, sometimes I just crave a freaking hamburger to bite into right like that's what I want at the time obviously a vegan one yell never real me moo, but in that moment what you'd still be allowed? Oh my God yells really changed guys Adam. I used to like cook salmon and privacy like I like I like She's gone. Everyone looked at those to make it a JB come to my house tonight and but one thing talking about like demos and what's valuable in that moment. Like one moment. This could be valuable for the next hour something else can and I think of really prime example and tell me if this would be intuitive to me. It seems that way. Yeah. Oh, but so when I initially didn't know what was going on with my hands and I was in hospital and it was a result of not having any circulation my fingers started freezing off and they were like going from Black to whatever it was people would say like what can I bring to her in the hospital? What can I bring? What can I bring in? The only thing I wanted was watermelon and I like watermelon but like in no way is that something like I typically crave or I want or like I need just watermelon and that was the only thing I wanted at the time and like I literally ate like probably like two watermelons a day like just cut up and and you know a few months post like my amputation surgery someone sent me. Me an article from the Harvard Business review or Harvard Business or I don't know my brain is going blank right now, but it was essentially about like the circulation properties of blood circulation properties of watermelon and how like they actually like sometimes recommended as a replacement for Viagra, which I actually take now as a medication three times a day and no I don't have erections because its original use was for blood circulation. But anyways, like my body was telling We got you want watermelon. You want watermelon now, do I crave it? No, but that's all I wanted at the time and I found that so fascinating.	1.0
That's totally intuitive. And and again, it's like you didn't even mentally understand why you were craving watermelon at the time but there's this inherent wisdom that your body has to know what it needs especially in a in a situation where there's something out of balance. So, you know, it's ironic because diet culture the system are like the system that exists that really promotes dieting as the way to health really demonizes cravings and tells us that our Cravings are something to it. Nor or that, you know, we need to fight or overcome our Cravings but in your case layout like you're craving was telling you the exact thing that you really needed and that was going to really benefit your body. So you listening to that and you giving your body what it needed was the best thing you could do for yourself at that time and probably had a really positive impact on your blood circulation at the time.	1.0
I'm hashtag intuitive AF but you can use all 10 fingers you only lost maybe if you're lucky. I don't know. What's going to how will I okay? I'm right now sitting here going please tell me some Behavior tips some how do I start? What do I do? What are some things to think about to start being more of an intuitive eater? Yes.	1.0
I think the number one way to start practicing intuitive eating is to just begin to notice when you make decisions about what you're going to eat. What are the factors that are coming into play that that come up for you as you're making that decision? So as we talked about if you're sitting down at a restaurant and you immediately think okay, what's the you know, quote unquote healthiest or like lowest calorie option.	1.0
That's what I should order notice that and they now sorry, especially now because everywhere you go there's like it's 310 calories. It's 1928 that like it but I want yes bars. I'm like, oh my God. I'm trying to choose a healthy option and they're still shoot me in the face with the calories, right?	1.0
So just like Italy underwater I don't I don't ever want to just order the water. No, I think that as soon as you bring in that number or that like external measurement of a food it inhibits your ability to actually check in with yourself and ask yourself what you feel like eating SO trading the rules about what you should be eating what you think would be a good choice and actually just start to feel into what you're craving what you feel like eating and instead of thinking about you know, how healthy this. All is or what? The calorie content is ask yourself. How do I want to feel after eating this or what value do I want to honor right now with this food decision. So really just starting to bring it to a more internal place that you're deciding for yourself what you want to eat instead of allowing some externalized message or voice tell you what you should order the next thing I would recommend for somebody who wants to start intuitive eating which is something you can do today. Is to start to get curious about the way that your body communicates with you in a unique which is unique to you. So how do you know you're hungry and what are the ways in which your body lets you know that you're hungry. How do you know when you're full and what are the cues that your body sends you to let you know that you've had enough to eat start to build awareness of these different cues so that you can build that sense of trust in your own body and you don't need to just look up what is a proper portion size for this. Food, but rather how much of this food do I actually need until I'm satisfied. And also just to start responding to your hunk like the bait the most basic intuitive eating recommendation I can make is just to honor your hunger which is another of the principles of intuitive eating. So when you feel hungry instead of like questioning yourself or asking yourself if it's okay to eat or if you can justify it in some way like what if you just gave yourself permission to eat and then you just moved on with your day and what would that change for you?	1.0
It's allowing yourself to be where you are. Right? No matter what it may be what you may be feeling and checking in with yourself is a really hard being. It's you really got to be true and honest with yourself to be able to do this in verses like, you know, comparing yourself to whether it be something you're seeing on social media or what you think that you should be doing or what your friend is doing for this like I feel like I should like green juice and I just effing done. Okay, like I Lee don't like kale drinks, okay or smoothie bowls for that. Yeah. I really what I prefer and I've learned this through my body. I don't love like yogurt-based smoothie or a milk-based like I like when I drink something healthy, I'm doing air quotes here. I want like this tart juice of like beets lemon grapefruit Ginger like that type and I could probably a Beretta she's a pizza from are you Dating love that that's all other episode we should do but those things I know right because of and I try to force myself because smoothie bowls are so all the fad and like they look so pretty with the acai color and the Granola and the things that on my Instagram feed, but you know what it's like what if I told you that you never had to drink a kale juice if you didn't want to or like right you like nobody is forcing you to drink the Milky smoothie Kool-Aid you don't have to do it.	1.0
And you know the no but there is a finding of guilt. Okay, like I could tell you if someone having health issues.	0.0
It's like I mean when I was in Austin, I literally paid like a MD natural naturopathic doctor to like tell me exactly what to do. Right and it's like you need to be drinking bone broth. It made me feel weird. I didn't like it. It was gross like but like when you are in certain situations, you're like, okay. I'm unhealthy. I just need to listen right like so and especially like in those situation that's also an Mo like things are really valuable to you. So you listen right or like everyone saying like now drink celery juice right? Celery. Truth is fun a hot friend.	0.0
It's yeah, it's trendy right now exactly.	1.0
So you know you have so then you have that and you're like, okay I should be healthy now or I'm doing this because of this but whereas or personally I like to order fruit smoothies, right, but then there's all these things of like It should be like you should be getting veggies in your smoothie should be doing this and this and then like I ordered this drink and I fucking hate it. Okay, like I shouldn't be having to like take shots of a smoothie to try gulp it down. Right? Like I and I just feel like these behaviors are essentially just reinforced or like doing these certain things or reinforce even by like seeing someone get so many likes on Instagram about it. I like oh they did that and like they look good and this and that so you do it and like we buy into these	0.0
Ideas that that's what we should like to yeah, and and you know, I do believe that there are people out there who are experts in nutrition and you know these different Medical paradigms, but somebody having a lot of Instagram followers does not necessarily mean that they know what's best for your body.	0.0
That's not a valid measure either guys. That's another example of invalid measurement totally and	0.0
You know, I do believe that there is Merit to some of these like Health Trends or these different things that are being promoted now sure but 100% you should always experiment and try something on for yourself and then decide for yourself if it works for you. Don't take anything. Even sometimes what your doctor is telling you like. Nobody knows more about your body and what something feels like in your own experience than you do. With intuitive eating it's like you have to develop that strong internal Compass so that you know when something sits right because you know, I use this example all the time but like something like broccoli for example is generally considered a healthy food, right? So it's like maybe you think I need to be eating more broccoli or like even if I don't like the taste of broccoli, it's healthy. I should be eating it. Some people may eat broccoli and get horrible gas or a terrible stomach ache and like not be able to function because Are so bloated for the rest of the day for that person maybe broccoli is actually not a healthy choice and maybe they can find another vegetable that works for them. So if their Doctor is recommending them to eat more broccoli, it's just not going to be the thing for them.	0.0
So we not have a parent. Sorry to interrupt you, but I totally see this all the time like I want my kid to eat broccoli. So I'm going to cover it and cheese and isn't heated and it's like that defeats the purpose completely because then they're not enjoying or intuitive. We enjoying the broccoli, right?	0.0
And then they also will have an association for the rest of their lives with like broccoli being this thing to be avoided at all costs instead, maybe find a vegetable that they actually just enjoy or like a way to have them eat more nutritious foods without trying to trick or force them.	0.0
Now I have one other thing. I don't know if this is about intuitive eating but this is just about me and I look at it behaviourally in terms of response effort, which response effort is. Exactly what it sounds like your response takes a lot of effort. So like you would always amazed me when we lived together. Like you'd be like filtering your own water system making your own milk to put on top of your like veggie. You're like oats in the morning or like your Chia what puddings I don't even know and I'm like this chick is so not lazy. Like it amazes me is like so like I what do you recommend? Doing because I find a problem also. Why okay, this is I know this isn't maybe not intuitive. I like why it's easier to eat unhealthy for example, or like maybe you're not even listening to yourself intuitively because you're honestly doing what is easier at the moment and like the easy options are like have you ever gone on a road trip and like tried eating healthy along the way it's really like it's like, oh my God, I'm gonna try be healthy. I'm gonna get Plain potato chips right like or I'm gonna get this bar that is essentially filled with so much crap or whatever it is because it's a matter of response effort to like you. I remember actually you want a way with people some words like some music festival or something. We're in Austin and like you packed all this food and like that seems like so much effort to me that I feel like it also does make like I don't know if I'm not necessarily listening to my Intuition or I'm just like doing what's easier.	1.0
Yeah, well, I think that is a really good point and it still is intuitive because when we make certain decisions about what we eat, we're always weighing our values against each other. So in the moment if you like, what are you going to value with the decisions that you make around food? So are you valuing convenience and ease or are you on another situation or another day valuing like feeling good in your body or feeling like one day is it spontaneity? JT and then the next day. It's like Integrity because you told yourself you were going to you know, eat a certain way and so it's okay for those values to change on a day-to-day basis and you always need to check in with yourself again to figure out like what am I what value am I honoring with this decision around my food? Also. It's like we all just have we all have different values and different priorities and you know, I'm a chef. I'm somebody who loves to cook so I know you would always say like you're so not lazy. I actually think it's fun to make my own cashew milk and I enjoy the taste if you don't it's okay not to do all those things, but can you find you know, can you still find balance and challenge yourself to maybe step out of your comfort zone a little bit if you do prioritize your health and if you do want to take care of your body without it being like a chore because if it's a chore, you're just not going to do it ever or stick to it, right?	1.0
There be no maintenance program for you if you're not enjoying it. Something that like again something you would mentioned was, you know, the dreading going to the gym like, oh my God, I have to go to this thing because this is you know, I need to move my body today. Like why don't you find something that you enjoy doing to move your body? Maybe you just go for a walk. Maybe you do like some gentle yoga on the mat just showing you do the monkey bars at the park. Yeah, right really swing on them recently.	1.0
It's like really hard.	0.0
It's Señor they were so easy. I can't even Swing from one ring to the next like at all and it used to be that it it's crazy how things change right because when you were little you were doing it because it was fun.	0.0
Like as you just said Casey you did it because you got enjoyment out of it. You could probably play on the playground for hours because you were just enjoying the experience of moving in your body and today, you know diet culture guess who I'm conditioned reinforcer activity tivity. Yeah, like if you make something a chore if you make something if you take the Joy out of it. You're not going to want to do it. So if you absolutely hate doing CrossFit, but you think you should because it's trendy and everyone's doing it. You're not it's going to feel like a punishment. But if you decide that you just like biking outside and that's just your exercise and it makes you feel strong and empowered in your body and you love being outside just do that and you never have to actually do CrossFit again, and I guarantee you you will show up to that bike ride way more. Fluently than you would to that CrossFit class.	1.0
Someone asked me on my Instagram or on actually Behavior bitches Instagram because I did the November motivate and move challenge because I really I find actual joy and moving my body. Like I know that when I go to the gym and work out with weights do things I actually feel a hundred times better. My anxiety is a hundred times better. It's not so when they said well, what's how do you find motivation? I'm like, it's more that I really just enjoy this. I'm not like having to look. Outside of myself to find the motivation the motivation is actually within me because of the way it makes me feel right the consequences that come after it during it also like I don't look at it as like to go to the gym. I look at it as like this is my time to show up for me and knowing that it's probably benefiting my body like not even physically of how I look but like internally like my heart muscle, you know, like things like that. It's so much more than just. Oh, I'm doing 50 squats and losing weight in my butt looks better like what about Internal organs your you know, everything that you don't really think about when you're thinking of oh, I have to go to the gym absolutely.	0.0
Like there are so many positive benefits that we get from moving our bodies and the second you make exercise about either a punishment for something you ate or simply for the pursuit of weight loss. It just takes the fun away and if we just remove that from the equation and treated exercise as a celebration of what your body we can do in a celebration of having the ability to even move your body, which is also just a privilege in and of itself how would shift your relationship to movement like, what would you do differently? You know, I also see people thinking like we live in like the no pain no gain culture right where it's like people think that you need to feel depleted and exhausted and like you can't move after snack Orangetheory. Yeah, right like okay calling them out, but it's true. It's like Who made that rule like why can't exercise be something that energizes me and that I like just enjoy but then I can have enough energy for the rest of my day. So maybe I don't go off because of in hiring me.	0.0
This is an adoring me because I feel guilty all the time that I don't like yoga. Okay, like I always feel guilty or like it's so good for your your lupus this and that blah blah blah like yoga like for your breathing and and like all this stuff. Duff and I like feel bad about it, but I really don't enjoy it like my natural movement. I want to do are things that are fast like boxing or you know, or I mean I can't do it as well as I used to like with my health things, but I just effing hate it like I really don't enjoy yoga. I'm so bored. There's 5 million other things I would rather be doing and I am just going to tell myself liad get the F over it you do not need to feel bad. Maybe that's not your workout.	0.0
Right and so I would say for you lie out like it's going to be so you're not doing your body that much good. If you go to a yoga class and are miserable and bored and stressed out the whole time because your mind and your body are connected. You can't really like outsmart your body in the way that you think you can I would just encourage you to find the movement that you do enjoy and just do that and and you don't have to do the thing that you just think is good for you. If you hate it the whole time right like find the things that do make you feel good. You're much more likely to do those more frequently.	0.0
Do you also think on the flip side and I'm just gonna yeah play devil's advocate here doing things that make you uncomfortable is you avoid them because there might be good for you. So like I've I love yoga. I also tend to not go to yoga when I have shit going on in my life that I don't want to face. Like I know when I go to yoga, I'm gonna have to like sit with myself and you know, I you know, and then I will instead when I'm you know, experiencing more stress or whatever. I might fill my time. With other things or in a cycle class where they're yelling at you I get it. You're so great Kick-Ass versus in yoga where it's like you're going to maybe you're gonna breathe here in this like pose for five, you know deep breaths and like maybe that's it. I mean, I know I don't make time for things like when my Apple watch goes off and tells me to breathe. I'm like, do you think I have three seconds to breathe right now fuck, you know, like like that which is pathetic like, I mean, that is all so pathetic, you know, it's like there's a difference between	1.0
Pushing yourself and getting out of your comfort zone and forcing yourself into something that's just not meant to be. Hmm. So I do believe it's up to the person to push themselves in a way where it still feels like overall. There's a positive benefit here, right? Because sometimes exercise does push us and it you don't always feel great and you should push yourself, but if you I truly think if you are tuned into yourself in a in a profound way. You can tell what's an exercise that is like comfortably pushing you to be better and stronger and something that's actually just going to hurt you or is just not right for your body. So again, it's up for each person to decide what what that is. I love that. I really love that.	1.0
This is the case when you're right. Yeah, maybe maybe I don't like it to sit with myself. I'm not sure like I that is another interesting point, which I don't have to get into on the podcast but I do think like when I am under stimulated I think about my health issues more like that is something I've noticed like for example, like on Shabbat when I like can't use the phone. I like TriCity talk to people do this whatever it is. Like I start like feeling my ailments or like all the ways that my lupus Our dorm affects me whereas like when I'm distracted and busy, I don't think about it. Well, this was so insightful. Yeah.

I know I'm loving it. I'm so glad you all enjoyed it and it's super interesting for me to hear about the connections with behavior because I do think there's like a primal element to intuitive eating that is hard to understand cognitively. But if you if you attach these behavioral principles that makes a lot more sense.	1.0
The whole world makes sense of behavior. Yell.	1.0
Do you want to be able to being learned a lot about that through living with liad as well? I think I became an apprentice.	1.0
You see did I would talk about behavior all day, huh? She's like hey really reinforce this did I reinforce it Leah.	1.0

Hey guys, it's yell. I just wanted to let you know about my holiday Empowerment Group. It's my group coaching program that will start the week before New Year's and continue throughout January and it's an alternative for people who want to escape the pervasive diet culture messaging and leave the New Year's wait resolutions behind and instead focus on your true health and becoming a more intuitive eater. So you'll receive 10 Deep learning videos. From me that I'll send out weekly each focusing on a different principle of intuitive eating how to break down and understand the principles and actually start living them. You'll also receive guided somatic meditations that allow you to understand the principles in an embodied way and not just cognitively you'll also receive reflective questions that allow for deeper introspection that you can translate these principles into your own life. So we also will meet every other The other week as a group to empower and support each other through a time that can be really stressful and difficult. If you're working towards a more enjoyable peaceful relationship with food know that there is another way and we're here for you. If you would love to join us.

Hey, what's up? Everyone? Hope you're doing awesome. Welcome to the podcast today. We're gonna do something a little bit different. I've interviewed a few people will keep it completely Anonymous but people with good marriages and talk a little more about boundaries and dating people, you know, Kristen I when we look back and we say we look back at our dating time. It's very often that will say man. I'm so glad we you know, I'm so glad we did that. I'm so glad we had that boundary what we look back and Man, if we could do it over we would do this a little bit differently. So I've sat down with a couple people and ask them questions and going to give you some feedback of boundaries and dating things to do things that were the right thing to do before marriage, maybe some things to do differently and break some things down here. So one of the couples that I spoke to you know, a lot of them actually came out to be the same thing and I think overall the the main voice as a Christian and and people called to the ministry. Yeah, but even just in general you're called to something as a child of God. You have a call on your life. It may be a Ministry calling. It may be a call to business. It may be whatever it is. But one of the main things that everyone repeated over and over Is We I made sure to speak the vision to be very clear and plain about speaking the vision that God has for my life and I thought it's interesting because the next question that you know in mind when I heard that was is it'd be pretty safe to say that you'd To have a vision for your life before you should be getting married. You know, I think it's interesting and Adam and Eve in the garden that God gave him a work to do first. And so God gave him this job. He named all the animals. He was to attend he knew exactly what God had sent him to do and then God gave him a wife you hear preachers all the story is if you don't have a job, you shouldn't be trying to get married. Yeah, just saying if you ain't got a job. You don't need a wife. What do you boo? What is she supposed to be a helpmeet? What is she helping with you? Trying to she coming in to do your dish? This is what she'd what's happening. And you kind of get it to do your laundry. He supposed to be a helper for the mission. You know, I think that's where people get off. One of the things that the one of the couple said is, which is awesome. You just said the first couple he said, you know, we I'm I made it a purpose. I look forward to my life as a life as a married couple and we want to serve God full out and I made it a purpose to do those things while we were dating. So serving the lord he We purposely plugged in to church more we served. He said we would go Soul winning together. He said I wanted he said the pace that we were running while we were dating is the pace that we were running now and he said something interesting and this may rub people the wrong way, but he said we weren't always minded just on on dating. He said I wasn't so dating minded. He said I was Kingdom. He didn't say Kingdom on it, but that's basically what it's saying. He said I was I set my eyes on doing the things that I was doing by myself before the relationship and then I wanted to be doing once we were married. Read so they were winning Souls together. He said I wasn't we weren't always just watching movies together and going on dates and going to the beach. He said it's not even things that are wrong. He's like, it's just things that are carnal. He's like you're in a people get in a carnal relaxed mode, but you need to be in a place of like going after the things of God and so you can tell in the marriage. I mean, they're having a great impact. They're called to the mission field but doing the things together that they wanted to do with their life when you look at the call of God on your life. What is that? Look, like is it is it winning Souls, if you're if you're a Christian, we're going to talk about that in a later podcast, but you're called the wind soul is your relationship should have that included in it. It should be something that you shouldn't be embarrassed to share the gospel with somebody if you're with your girlfriend if that should be a red flag if you're with your girlfriend or boyfriend and you have to tone down the things of God. You're not in the right relationship where you have one of those around them.	0.0
You don't want to bring them to your church because they're going to think it's weird or you don't want to you know, You don't want to talk about the things of God with them or the things that you feel called to do because you know some somewhere deep down inside. You know, that they're not on the same page with you. Well, that's the first thing you need to you need to dump them because they are not on the same page with you and especially if you're a woman and you're looking at this guy and you're like, you know truly he's not everything that I ever thought that I could have in a husband but you know, the devil's lied to you to make you think that you this is as good as it's gonna get I want to tell you if you're in a relationship like that. Get out of it quick and just be thankful that you didn't get married already and just be great glad that you still have time. God can restore redeem and he can push you with the right person, but don't be caught in this trap the way you think that since you're in this relationship already that now you have to conform your life to fit into this relationship with this person. That doesn't have a Zeal for God like you have just because you're already in the relationship for whatever reason it's not it's not permanent. And you know, if you are married then you need to now pray for your spouse. You need to now make it your goal that you're going to believe God that this person is going to come around on the same page with you, but I will tell you that's the harder road to take. So if you're not married to that person yet. Don't marry them based on the fact that you think well because they're just so cute that everything's going to work out even though they have no Zeal for God and you know that you can run circles around them spiritually and they're not even interested.	0.0
And so that's what stop trying to put a round Peg. Us into a square hole, you know when that was a big thing with everyone all of the couples that I spoke to they all said we spoke the vision. We made it clear. Hey, this is the guy especially hey, this is what I'm called to do. Are you willing to go with me? I'm not trying to like, oh this one. I think it can work. I was in a personally I was in a relationship back in the day that I was like trying to figure it out like oh, you know, this person's not exactly what I thought when I mentioned Ministry, they like froze like a deer in headlights, but I think we could make it work, you know like Like you need it if you're called to go into full-time Ministry. You shouldn't be looking for someone who's like who doesn't wanna have anything to do with it. I just want to stay home with the kids someone who's like I've talked about before someone who's like working for the weekend, you know, I just love to travel. I love going on vacation. You need someone who's like willing to work like there's a mission at hand. Adam didn't get Eve so she could like spend all his money and take them on vacation. So you could take on vacation like there needs to be a purpose behind your marriage. Even if it isn't Ministry if it's like, hey, we're We're Kingdom Minded people and that's the whole purpose of this podcast is like get you to be Kingdom Minded like your life isn't get an education get a good job retire at 65 and enjoy life as much as you can. That's not the gospel. The gospel isn't enjoy life. The gospel is take up your cross and follow Jesus like your life on this Earth, you're gaining treasure in heaven. You're going to spend eternity and treasure and maybe if you're lucky a hundred years on this earth like at a hundred and eight years at I tried hundred and twenty years at Max but our life here on Earth is is short. This is a time of sowing and reaping for eternity that you are making choices now. And so your marriage should be geared in that direction. We one of the things that was said and I'll go over some of the Practical boundaries, but they said that they didn't want to be always on the defensive so they had clear boundaries. Hey, we're not going in the house together by ourselves. We're never going the bedroom together. Even if there are people in the house there were some practical things. You know, I think I think you shouldn't be making out with somebody like full-on like making out with somebody before you're married. I think you know, it's crazy. It's 2019. It's normal in this day and age even by Christian standards like it's cool to fool around a little bit like but draw the line for yourselves everyone that I talk to and these are people that I look at and say they have a they have a good marriage. They all said, you know, we had clear lines and if any of them said hey, what do you if you could do things differently it was hey, I wish we had drawn more. Clear lines. I wish it had been clear. I wish we would have I wish we would have I was I wish the boundaries would have been better. No one said, you know, I think our boundaries were too strict.	0.0
I think if we could go back we could have been a little a little bit looser with our promiscuity, you know in the thing is as we had very strict boundaries for what most people would say because well first of all, both of us were grown up adults and he had his own house and you know, he could have had me we could have been hanging out at the house, but that was one of our things we didn't go in the house together. Ourselves unless there was somebody there I most definitely did not go into his room whether he was there or not. I didn't go in his room. Like there was just some things that I felt like it was very clear boundaries. We weren't like laying down together on the couch. Like there was just things, you know, there's just things staying staying horizontal. No staying vertical don't stay here. Don't stay horizontal staying vertical, you know, while you're hanging out that's that's one way to make sure that certain things, you know. Staying pure and so we would say, you know, we look back on our dating and though we were very very strict, you know more than most people that you know, I don't know we can't really compare but probably very strict and in comparison to what most Christians would say that was their dating boundaries and I would say if we would go back we would definitely be more strict because the thing is you cannot steal something from marriage in your dating time and then be fulfilled fully like you're supposed to be in marriage the same.	0.0
Way, I fully believe that what you do in dating like when you go too far you steal from Marriage from that and so you're stepping over boundaries that when you get into marriage, you're like, they'll be less of an enjoyment. So you have a and that's why you shouldn't date for too long. Like if you're 14, first of all, you shouldn't be dating. I don't think anyone under 18 needs to be dating. The purpose of dating is marriage. It's not to have a friend like the that's the purpose. It's like what is this person right for me? I think honestly, there are some 18 year olds who are like ready to be married. Read and there's different people I wasn't I mean I was 30 when I got married, but if you don't have life figured out, if you don't know what you're called to do, if you don't have a job if you're living at home, if you're not you don't have a course that you're on if you're like still playing video games for a few hours a day. You're not ready to be married. And therefore you should not be dating but choosing the right thing understanding the purpose. It's not companionship. It's not so your Instagram feed can be awesome. People can think you're popular like the purpose of dating is in that's another thing too because because of how	0.0
Instagram and all this is so huge with this generation and people get this little peek into your life. That's all the more reason to be so much more careful what you're doing where you're at and where you guys are together because you know, maybe we see you're at the house together sit on the couch and there's other people around but we don't know and so now we all think you guys just hang out at the house together because that's what's on your Instagram, you know, and so then it leads us to believe we don't know where you draw lines. We don't know where you draw boundaries. And so now you've given off the appearance of evil because you know, we don't know the full backstory and so I would just say to somebody who's dating be so conscious of the fact that first of all you're an example to people that are younger than you your example to people that are around you especially if you're in the church, especially if you're a leader and you're somebody that people look to you know, everything that you display of your life in social media, you know, people are looking at and they're analyzing whether you whether you think they are not they're doing it and they're looking to there. Really looking for you to set a standard. You know, when we when we go when we used to go on trips with our with our work and we were working a secular job people would always come up in make jokes about us, you know, not drinking alcohol and be like, hey you want a drink you want a drink and of course, you know, we don't drink never have and that's not something that we want at all. It's not even a temptation. But you know, there was there's one person in particular that would always be like, hey, you know have a drink have a drink and I think I think back to all those times and I'm like, you know What if we actually would be like, you know what since you've offered it like 25 times sure why not that person would be so disappointed because the thing is people actually like clear set boundaries. They actually want to see you as a Christian live differently than them as the world. And so that's why you find people people that are unsaved they'll see somebody that was like a minister at a bar and then they're like, hey, why is that guy here? You know the unsaved person thinks it's strange that you as a Christian are trying to Gov and be like the world so so it's even more so you should be looking at your life and evaluating. Okay, what are the things that I need to be doing? Especially as a young single person especially as a dating Christian person. I can't look like the dating person that goes on vacation with their with their they're very, you know, their boyfriend or girlfriend. That's not what you do as a dating Christian that's just doesn't work and it's the biggest thing that came across from you when I spoke to	0.0
These couples was they talked about having clear boundaries. And so for all of you out there listening. I'm going to give a little bit of homework here, but you should even if you're if you're in a relationship if you're not in a relationship, especially if you're not yet in a relationship, but you should write down clear boundaries and you should have them prepped out before we're on where if you start dating someone that you can have a sit down and say listen, this is the boundaries that I'm committed to when I spoke to this first couple they said men and the The wife said it was so good for me. I have such trust in him because he sat down he had his boundaries. She had her boundaries. They kind of came to a consensus and they said will never cross there someone if we feel like it's getting to be too much someone's going to yell and they and I asked him I said, what would you do differently? Is there anything you would change and they said honestly we didn't and that's really the fruit. You don't want to leave it until you're in a compromised situation to exercise self-control. That's when it's too far. The Bible says to make no. Vision for the flesh. If you find yourself in a position where things are being compromised. You've actually made an allowance in your boundaries. Your boundaries should be that you're not in a compromised position and not only that but like Krista said to avoid the appearance of evil you doing that. I mean there's there's coffee drinks that I can't take pictures of and post on my Instagram story because like Nitro coffee, it looks like beer right and so I drink Nitro coffee but almost drink it in secret because it's like I can't it's coffee. I don't have any taste for alcohol. Never touch alcohol. I don't even eat alcohol. I don't even eat alcohol. It's not even if it's in and if it's in my food if I read it on a on a restaurant menu, I don't order that thing because there's alcohol in it, right? That's how that's how strict I am with myself on that. But but I won't take pictures of it because people all of a sudden think what even if it's one out of 200 who doesn't know that I'm in the craft coffee and love good coffee and thinks I've got I'm drinking alcohol. I just won't let it happen. So avoiding. Yeah if it causes one.	0.0
Listen to fall into a life of sin, you know, and that's the thing, you know our life as Believers. We've been called to a higher standard and then you know on top of that, you know, if you if you want to go the extra mile and you want to be a person you feel that you're called into Ministry. Then you go the the extra extra mile to be an example to other believers, but whether you are a Ministry or not, you're an example to Believers, you're an example in your love and your faith in your Purity. And so you have to be you have to be on your on your A game when it comes to what two people see it. If I had to wear a t-shirt that said this is you know, my life mission statement. I don't pick it. It's just what people have evaluated of Me by what they see on my Instagram by what they see me doing what I actually want to wear that t-shirt. You know what I be or would I be ashamed of what people think of me and what people say of me when I'm not around so, you know, we want to challenge you and there's probably a lot more that we could say on this but you know as a single young person in this is the question we get so much, you know, what do I do with my singlehood years? as you know, how do I what what is what is expected of me as a single person and I'm going to do some more podcasts on this because I believe it's something that if you're if you guys are if you guys are wanting to hear more on it, we want to we want to be talking more on it because you getting bombarded so much with impunity and and immorality and so we want to be that voice that tells you you know, what if you're being pure stay on the path God is so proud of you for setting yourself apart and for putting a you know, putting yourself in a position that yeah it may make Stand out to the world and maybe even make you stand out to your family. They make you stand out to other people, but God is proud of you. You're on the right path stay with it. If you need encouragement, we're here for you. Please find us on Instagram. We want to encourage you because you're doing such an amazing job as put by putting yourself, you know in a place where you saying, you know, I'm going to live for God full out and I'm going to be pure every single day.	1.0
We love you. Thanks for listening. We'll catch you next time.	1.0
I also have everyone go vote can't do it at the same time. I'm sorry. It just it's terrible right now because we only got one mic on our side and if you don't know why I don't have a mic is because we only have two mics and the other mic is given to none other than our lovely cousin Brandon 20 Poe.	0.0
Hello. Everyone. Hello.	1.0
How's everybody doing? Just so you know? Alright, so today we want to talk a little bit about Fitness and you know trying to get into getting to healthy habits, but first we just want to introduce you and we just want to have you explain a little bit of you know, how you how you even know us.	1.0
First of all, I am the best I am the First cousin of Richard and Nico. My mom is the sister of their dad and we have been best friends ever since we were younger and that's how I know you guys you guys my cousins.	1.0
Yes, that's cool. When we were younger. We were super close and now that we're older we're super close. Yeah even Closer Closer now. Yeah, he's one of my brother's groomsmen by the way. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
Well, yeah, we have that introduction. Now. Let's get let's get even deeper. What do you do Brandon? Yeah. What do you do?	1.0
Oh, well, I help people become better versions of themselves. And so my occupation is a personal trainer personal trainer for California Family Fitness in Sacramento, but I don't really just look at myself as a trainer. I look at myself as a life coach kind of someone who has more of a therapeutic side. It not just physical. It's not just exercise but it's more about your daily decisions more about your habits. It's more about just trying to become a better version than what you were yesterday just baby steps. So just me being on the sidelines trying to help people coach them Mentor them to be better than they were is an absolute blessing and tell us.	1.0
How did you get there? Oh man, where do you start off?	1.0
So before I became a trainer, I was working at Cold Stone Creamery for Five years and that was you know, I had a great job there taught me a lot of character. I was cleaning every night taught me to bring the energy but how personal training came about was. I was training my mom and my dad one Saturday morning at Cal Fit and I was stretching them in the manager walked by and he approached me and said that I wasn't allowed to like instruct or tell them what to do because it would be a liability but He offered me an opportunity and he said if you take the certification through our club you could be a trainer for us and pass the certification and the rest was history. It's been four years since I've been trying to now it's crazy.	1.0
Have you always been into fitness?	1.0
Like even before I think Fitness was instilled in me ever since I was in karate at age nine. I was doing karate four to six times a week, you know one to two hours a day sometimes three, especially on the weekends and you know, I would compete and I think that competitive Wedge was instilled in me ever since I was a kid and you did pretty well. Yeah, if I mean I was very competitive with serious, you know, and I give thanks to my Sensations the John out there. He was like my second dad and you know, he was definitely one of the reasons why I'm such a great trainer today because he the way that I count the way that I talk the way that I push other people he did to me. So kind of he left his print in my life.	1.0
Yeah, it's pretty deep so you definitely take some of that. From what you learned in karate to like when you train you're absolutely right science. Is that how it works right now?	1.0
We're yeah. Yeah, it does it's, you know, the technique and stuff it's different but the it's more of the mental thing. Yeah. He's the one who caught me taught me discipline sacrifice because since he Etc, you know, just got to work. That's it, man.	1.0
And what's your favorite thing about being a life coach a personal life?	1.0
Everything is knowing that you know in any small way or any big way. I could have a positive influence on someone's life. You know, I feel like a lot of us haven't sometimes our judgment is cloudy. Sometimes we don't know why things are the way they are and so I just try to help increase my clients awareness and understanding the true problem and then going to the root and seeing how we can transform them internally and then eventually as we do that the external transformational just follow, you know, so it's more just about what are you doing day? Like, why do you why do people want to lose 10 pounds? Why do what people want to lose 30 pounds? But really it's Yes, it's a health decision. But it's also an emotional decision. Yeah, like good exactly. Right. It's a you know, what sometimes the opinions of others have like a huge role but I think the most important thing is your own opinion, you know, everybody's different. So what makes you happy is it losing 20 pounds? Is it getting a little bit stronger? Is it, you know increasing your self defense is it just being more functional, you know, everything's different majority of your clients.	1.0
What what type of people are they? Like are they the type to	1.0
Want to lose 10 pounds or more for most people it's toning losing body fat. Just being yeah, I would say that like more body composition wanting to and you know, 80% of all clientele are females. And so if you think about after pregnancy, if you think about how females invest in their lashes their nails their plastic surgery everything their hair, you know, they invest in their bodies and so but with males is a little different because you know, we go through Sports we have friends that we hang out with that we all gym and like Sigmund Freud said it like most males the reason why we exercise So it's sex-related. So he says like the reason why people want to drive fast cars are the reason why they want to buy nice shoes of the reason why they want to dress a certain way is because they want to attract other people. It's like something called pheromones. So yeah, it's very very interesting. So he says a lot of the decisions that we actually make the color that we want the body that we want or the kind of house or car or job. You know, there is kind of like sex-based kind of Interest Is pretty interesting, you know, but anyway back to Just Fitness and itself being a trainer for the past four years has saved my life it gave me a sense of purpose and I've dealt with a lot of drug addiction to the past and also dealt with you know, just finding my own security and life but personal training kind of just fell into my lap and it allowed me to do something greater than myself. So it was nice and Growing up are going to college you didn't study to be a nosy right now. I wanted to do a first, you know, I wanted to be a doctor but I didn't want to be a doctor. It was something that my parents wanted me to do. Yeah, you know and then as I started realizing what I really wanted to do, I just kind of went with my own instincts. There's that Jim Carrey thing that he said where ya know you can either live your life doing something that you kind of like doing and fail at that. Or you can live your life and do something that you love right and fail at that like at least go out with doing something that you love because you know, he talked about his dad and his dad just you know wasn't really living happy lives. Thanks for trying to find, you know purpose like what really drives you what gives you fulfillment in life. It's really just about service. It's about what you're doing for other people. That's what gives you like the most Joy before you're doing Fitness.	1.0
You are actually working like at a clinic.	1.0
like some kind of like medical yeah yeah yeah I was getting volunteer hours I was working at a hospital I did also did an Outpatient Center and but were you fine like did you find like enjoyment like no matter how it every time I was I was looking at the clock you know and once I came to the point where I was not present in my work I just told myself why would I like why would I trade that well when I trade my time for money and at least I should be doing something that actually lose myself in like loot like enjoy your work you know they say the three habits of Happiness the first one is journaling take it like you know really increase your awareness of everything that's happening like I'm having my first podcast my two cousins I have the pretty ladies over here you know we're all 26 When We Were Young you're healthy our family's okay like journaling support because it helps increase your gratitude right the second habit of happiness is savoring so when you have a cup of coffee or cup of tea don't just drink	1.0
It you sipping on it savor it taste it favorite, you know a good one.	1.0
Enjoy it Savor Life Saver the conversation Savor the Time Saver the meal Savor the workout Savor the day right? Because you never know when your last one is and the third one. The third habit of happiness is Find meaning in your work find purpose in your work. So journaling savoring and Find meaning your work and it's just yeah, that's what that's what training gave me.	1.0
Did you get a lot of Backlash from parents or out.	0.0
Absolutely. I got into it my dad a little bit, you know going against his beliefs. He you know wants me to be financially secure and his own belief is I have to be in the medical field where I have to do something that related to succeed but then I think really the bigger picture for him was just me want him wanting me to get out my comfort zone and not settle for mediocrity, but my paycheck does not define that. You know and once I kind of stay true to myself, I'm much more like my mom. We're both very emotional people and she followed her passion. She loves what he does. She does. She definitely has moments of high stress, but at the end of the day, you know, she's not waking up or having like anxiety to come into work on Monday. She went, you know went through that phase for 20 years of her life where she was working for a company Sunday night. You know, she have to wake up the next morning 5:30 6 o'clock wouldn't get home till seven stuck in traffic. Have to make dinner for the kids only get 30 minutes to an hour with her kids. And I remember being kid always wanting that time with her, you know, like where's mom like, you know, and it was tough but you know, sometimes tragedies our disguises blessings and seven years ago when she got late 7 or 10 years ago. I don't know when she got laid off from her job. She just decided to follow her heart and open her own catering business and now, you know by the by the blessings of God and the Lord she's Families doing well, you know and I know we're very humbled for all the opportunities but you know, I'm just really happy that she can lead right she followed she's doing what she loves. She's following her dreams and I'm also following mine but people who are listening shout out to Heavenly food creation and help grow, but make sure you go follow them on Facebook.	1.0
Her name is Winnie one. Tipo look her up. You got a wedding. You got a bar. Mitzvah. You got any kind of Celebration? She's the person to go to shout out to unto weenie. He shout you out right now. Anyways back to be Bunty phone though. All right, so, you know what? I'm really glad we were able to have this conversation with you because it's bringing awareness to a lot of people that work like a 9 to 5 job, you know, there's people out there that they go to a job and it's like they're just killing themselves salsa, you know trying to find themselves, you know, let me be honest with you if I always tell people when I get compliments of the gym.	1.0
You know, you're in great shape or I want to be like you right? I don't I truly don't believe that I would be in the shape. I am now if it wasn't for my environment, right like you are what your environment is if I hang out with a whole bunch of depressed people most likely I'm going to be depressed if I hang around with people that are usually up like really positive most likely I'll be positive if I'm hanging around people that all Count Their macros and go to the gym six times a week most likely I'll be fit right etcetera. So I am kind of humbled. I'm occupation, but the same time if I worked at nine to five or ten to six whatever it's either I got to wake up really early in the morning and be tired and work out or go to the gym after work where I'm tired and work out. So I understand like how hard it must be for people to have consistency. Like you have to make it a daily plan where you're going to go designate this time and just execute and stick with it. Right and accountabilities huge. You know, that's why I said It's important to have somebody that could keep you in check. Whether is your best friend your brother or your spouse or a trainer a coach whatever but honestly with those people I completely understand. I think the goal is really just to find a balance in your life. Like it's not everybody's goal to be in the next bikini competitions not everybody's goal to be the next powerlifter. It's not everybody's goal to run a mile in, you know, five minutes six minutes. I think just follow what makes you happy with his Jiu-Jitsu that you love if it's basketball. All that you love if it's yoga that you love just continue to do that and you know be mindful of your nutrition. I think for me what's really worked is intermittent fasting is give me it gives me a block where I could eat at a particular time also count my calories and I think that gives me flexibility with feeding Cravings think counting calories is a huge skill that a lot of people don't consistently do and I'm a big advocate of that because that really changed my life ever since we watched The Hodgetwins that's how I learned counting calories. Calories in versus calories out. These guys are eating chicken the chicken nuggets. They're eating pizza. They're having Taco Bell and they're still looking good and I was like, I was confused. What do we eat for dinner? Like I was under the conventional thought that you have to eat brown rice chicken and broccoli meal prep your food in order for you to be fit. But you don't yeah, you don't like you. All you have to do is track your calories do a little bit of cardio hit a little bit of resistance just baby steps like when my favorite quotes is by Bruce Lee and he says I do not fear the man. The kick is 10,000 times. I fear the man the kicks once a day for ten thousand days. So at the end of the day, it's not about short-term intensity. It's about consistency. Right just it's it's the accumulation of the little things that matter right? It's habits is where we're creatures of habit. So I think that's about anything in life. If you want to be successful in anything. It's really just about consistency. That's it.	1.0
So and how do you tell your clients that so I'm sure that you deal with clients? To even though you give them this whole Spiel they just don't fall into the tea they kind of slack off or they give you attitude. So with that kind of scenario.	1.0
What do you typically do but they might think that you should go through that. My thing is just showing patience, you know, Transformations don't happen overnight and I think for me, it's just trying to challenge them in their weak areas and just keep them accountable drink more water. Like a lot of people don't drink enough water dude for females out there track your water intake at least 90 fluid ounces of water or two-thirds of your body weight and for males you want at least a hundred twenty fluid ounces or two-thirds of your body weight. So a lot of people when they train and I asked how much water they have. They're hella tired in the beginning and I asked how much water in there like I haven't had any water. I just had my coffee right and then if you're if you're sleeping for six to eight hours, you're not having any water then we wake up you go pee you have coffee you have you haven't had water for 10 12 hours possibly and then you try to work out and do cardio and less weights your guests 70% of your muscle is water that you need water. So that's number one. One two, I'll try to help them. Tell them to get a little more rest if they can because that's a big thing. But you know, if they slip I think it from me. I've learned that it's better just to keep showing positive encouragement instead of trying to tear them down. You know, it's kind of like parenting and you don't want to tear people down.	1.0
So if someone's watching this right now and they're like they've never even stepped on a treadmill before and there. Life and you know, their eating habits are really bad. Like what is the first thing that you would have them do like First Time Fitness ever like they came into the gym. They said I want Brandon blind people. Where do I begin?	0.0
You know, I think that Doing things at an extreme measure like trying to do everything all at once can be paralyzing. Let's say like it's decision paralysis when you tell somebody I want you to do an hour of cardio a day. I want you to count your calories. I want you have this much water. I want you to sleep this wedge apple cider vinegar. I want you to have 30 25 to 35 grams of fiber at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. If you throw too much shot them they kind of get like get stuck it in there. Yeah, so I try to give them a smart goals something that's specific something that's measurable. All something that's realistic attainable the timely and example of a smart goal is I want you to lose four pounds in four weeks. I want you to track your water intake. I want you to track your way and every single day and then at the end of each week take the average of your weight and the compared to the next and to the next so it's like once I hear yeah, you're not you're not looking day-to-day measurements. You're looking at weekly measurements and on average. So you get a general idea of where your weight is. Actually that's kind of like stocks, you know goes up it goes down. But where is the general Trend going, you know? A lot of fluctuations that people have our water weight fluctuations. You have salt you have sugar you have alcohol you have menstruation. You have stress. You have sleep. You have so many things fiber that affect your water weight at that particular point. So it's important to take your weigh-ins average them out compared to the next week. So you get a general idea. Am I really losing weight and my maintaining what's the rate at my loser? Because you can lose the to 3 pounds a day go in the sauna cut your car. Yeah, you know eat clean and that's just a lot of water weight. Illusion, but if you're talking about fat loss fat loss takes time. Yeah about 1 pound per week. Gotcha.	0.0
So dang really, it's your rights consistency throughout the like you want them to lose a pound every single week.	1.0
And then from there it's baby steps, you know, and it could I possibly be more but you want to give people there's something magical happens when you have psychological wins, right like waking up early and following through or doing the cardio for 20 minutes. Like you said you were going to do a reading for 10 minutes if you said or saving $500 a month extra hundred even anything just set a goal something that's attainable something they can do and just keep building off of that and over time next, you know, you're successful, right but you just have to stay like Gary Vee says micro speed macro patients micro speed macro pain, you got to move quickly. You got to execute you got to have a plan of attack strategy, right? And then you got to be patient with the process and that's deep. Do you know where did this love you Fitness?	1.0
So cousin quality time. I guess I was it you guys in the next video. Thank you for listening the next one. What kind of what kind of workouts?	1.0
You think I should start off with I think you know having a combination of three things of doing some type of cardio some type of dynamic stretching and static stretching combination of both and also doing a combination of compound lifting and functional things is important. So an example for you, you know would be someone more from 5 to 10 minutes on the treadmill elliptical or StairMaster do a little bit of Mobility routine loosen up your hips because you down a lot loosen up your back foam roller. Been about 15 20 minutes on that. So look about 30 minutes of warming up where your body is, like actually sweating before you do workout and the great dead great compound exercise or deadlifts just important that you keep your spine neutral and I would definitely if there's one workout that I would like you to start doing it would be dead lifts, like straightening your back straight to New York or your glutes. It's a full body workout. So you're not a lot of birds with one stone with that one movement. I just got to make sure you do it correctly and then like a lot of stability core exercises and the cardio, you know, it's not again. It's you know, it's not about intensity is just about consistency, you know, you know that you know how to track your calories. You're pretty good at that quick question.	1.0
So does it matter like what routine you do throughout the week? Like because you know, like if you go on YouTube or like you look at someone else's like routine throughout the week, it could be like chest and back day or left chest and arm day and leg day does it does that really matter?	1.0
They're all very there's a lot of variations of different programs out there different splits, you know, but the most important thing again is just consistency because I don't focus on the Minor Details. I mean if you are only able to go to the gym three times a week, I would probably do a leg Push Pull or three full body workouts or depending on whatever your goals are. You just have to prioritize that workout program towards whatever your goal is. Gotcha.	1.0
Okay, because for me I know like I always get stuck on like trying to figure out Out like oh man, I gotta do my back day now and then tomorrow I got to focus on chest day but like toms you can do both, you know just to save a little bit time.	1.0
Like if it really I think the biggest part that people don't hit enough of consistently is just through the nutrition because if like there are the I've had clients that aren't extremely active. I have a 59 year old client. She was 278 pounds when we first met and she's lost 57 pounds. She's now in like 2:17 to some and for her to do it and she has any issues and she's five two five three this Asian lady. The biggest thing that we just focus on was her nutrition and she countered a calorie she weighed her food out. She kept her diet simple and she was losing weight. You know, we I was she trained with me two times a week and then I had her come and once on the weekend by herself and literally I would just prescribe her 20 minutes of cardio 10 minutes before ten minutes after a little bit of free weights here and there a little bit of machines and over time. It was really the nutrition that guided her to get to where she wanted to be, you know, so I think for a lot of people the nutritional part is hard, you know food is our Escape is definitely my Escape black. I love food, you know, but, you know a little bit of sacrifice like during the week and then you get enjoy yourself on the weekend. I think he's really again all about balance if you have 30 days if you're good, 25 out of those 30 days most likely you'll have results right always tell people Good day of bad eating or one bad day of eating will not hurt you in one good day. Beauty will not help you. It's really just about what are you doing for? The most part right? Don't focus on the little things. What are you doing on the bigger picture? Yeah like that.	1.0
I think I think we're good. Let's do a speed round. Let's do a speed run of quick questions quick answers. What's wrong with that? Well, I didn't even say anything. I saw you were like, all right. First you go for a second so I can get an idea what you want. Okay. Okay. All right percentage ratio between workout and diet go. Like what's more like? Yeah that like if you have to put that in percentages.	1.0
I would do 6040 60/40 I think 60% diet 40% workout. I think you know you do have to work hard to to get like you can't just you know, it's a good combination of both. I just say I would put 60/40 because I feel like a lot of people when it's January 1st. The very first question that they asked for that the devil's tell themselves is I got to go to the gym. They're not they're not thinking I gotta save calories or I gotta watch my eat my food just like I gotta go too. Like a lot of times when people are broke their like I got to find more ways to make money right now. You have to find ways to decrease your expenses. I focus on what you can control first, right? And so it's just really about detaching yourself keeping track. You know, I think having the ability what one of my mentors told me what doesn't get measured does not get improved. You have to have some type of Quantified measurement so that way okay. It's a Earth to see this time, how can I get a B next time How can I get a right? So for people track a calories while your food out for not waiting some of your food out in your kind of just estimating that can only take you so far but honestly once you get in the habit of doing so keep things simple prep your meals I just have a whole bunch of foods, you know ready in the fridge. That way you don't have to eat things that you know overload on things that are healthy for you now and you can still have a good time like you don't have to, you know, go be all in. Have to be too extreme like find a balance, you know, enjoy your life suposed to be a speed round.	1.0

You know saying that's my that's my baby, you know. She honestly I was supposed to go to with a wedding. I was supposed to go to a wedding with her today and she knew that this weekend was important for me to spend time with my family and my friends with my boys and honestly for her to give me this moment, it's a type of love that is liberating not controlling, you know, and I've had my fair share of controlling relationships in the past and for me to be at this point, she had this been with you guys. It's really cuz I her so, thanks, baby. I love you. Thank you. Mom my dad for being together for 37 years. It was just their anniversary couple days ago. So ever so, you know, one of the reasons why I am the way I am is because my parents have been able to have that consistency in their marriage and be great role models for their kids. And then thank you to California Family Fitness and all the clients and all the family that in relationships that I've gotten over there. And thank you too. Just everything and everybody aim.	1.0
Men, yeah, thanks to the rooster crows cover. That was so with the boosters Rose.	1.0
You don't share a lot of experiences and you know. Just enjoy we both both my cousin's we literally can just be in bed. Chill together eat good food. Have a good workout and just do the simple things in life. And it really doesn't matter what we do when I'm with them. It's just as long as we're together and I think that's the beauty of it is. It's very low maintenance, you know, just as long as we have each other we find gratitude in that and it's always a good time, you know, but with you know, Richard Nico both of them, you know, they Have they're like my best friend's, you know, they've been my best friends ever since I was younger and you know, keep it real with you guys, you know, as you get older things change feelings change people change. There's a lot of movement in life. And sometimes you forget about the people that helped you get to where you are and I think for me by my you know, the blessing my mom. She had told me a couple weeks ago that because it's miss me and and I wanted Create consistency and effort and shows them that I miss them too. And I know it's been hard and I know it's hasn't been things. Haven't been the same. So it's kind of like having that body bit about bodybuilding mentality, like whatever your weak points are in a relationship like focus on those like all the people in Sacramento. Like I see them consistently. I see my baby girl Cindy all the time. I see Kev, you know weekly, you know, it's about maybe investing time in to the people that you don't see a whole lot like I don't see my sister's a whole lot. My nephew's a whole lot my cousins a whole lot. So I think this year I definitely want to have a better goal of strengthening the relationship those types of relationships.	1.0

So he started first doing bodybuilding stuff like isolation into regular gym and his told me a come with me you train so because we were once in a theater, we were once teammate in a small competition basketball here in Amsterdam. So, yeah. We kind of he kind of trained for that. So he dragged me into it. Let's begin strong. Like how often do you goes?	1.0

Unfortunately. It was the lifestyle next to it.	0.0
My lifestyle was just drinking and smoking next to that even though and I became Christian that didn't when Way that fast so and I was keep smoking and drinking while playing basketball like my conditioning is hello. Yeah, my range of motion is messed up because all of the contraction well exercises.	0.0
So yeah, where are we so I got introduced to cuspid.	1.0

All right, awesome. And you started to go right from the start like three four. Times a week. Wow. Yeah at first yeah, my pastor always pick me up or I pick him up and we're just going to go carpool because it's in Amsterdam. It's too far and yes try to doing three times a week. But of course, I want to go more. It was Ruiz just its role addictive, but I can because first the distance and of course we took to gasoline is high that time.	1.0
So I bought a scooter absurd am how long was the drive it is 40 minutes 40 minutes. You could get it by 30, but you're not going to stop it and stops it stopped. So just riding the red line. I remember I remember the guys on our small group start doing it as well. So who cook? Sigmund and Randall nodes up for a free trial session into the box where I restraining while Sigmund Kip kept doing it. So he signed up right away after he his first free trial but no way notes Randall. I don't know. He's just not into it yet.	0.0
But now he's a member of our Box O and your brother good God.	1.0
He's yeah, he's started a couple of months later. Later in the other box one box in hard time.	0.0
So yeah, and how long have you been going there to Armstrong well-trained therefore more than almost a year so Matt, my first year of experience in CrossFit was really terrible because always get knee pain or had a serious back injury. It's like spasms that's real. Man, it's hard. It's almost 2 months that I couldn't live a bar. Also reason.	0.0
Well, there was one of the workouts that we need to do a heavy deadlifts and the next day we need to do a heavy back squat. And of course, my form is really sucks and I wanted so bad. So yeah that happens guys. If you do not train smart that eventually will happen so Yeah, I thought to myself it's this is not the way to do it.	0.0
So. I need to do something I need to do something right so I ran I had the opportunity to go to the states to rest Rascals were so that that's where Prospect started had the opportunity to go there because of our church Community like they say they're there they were they're having a conventional camp for young adults back there that I was talking about 2014, but how long can the month they think five weeks by Manhattan weeks.	1.0
So when they're talk to my pastor, I'm going to I'm going to come there. I went there with Sigma.	1.0
So I was a week ahead of him and then he followed then so my goal there as well.	1.0
of course going to that conventional thing conventional camp	1.0
I was I want to look into the boxes right feel the feel how they really do it feel how they really train. What's really crossed with looks like because in my feeling CrossFit in Europe, it's still young still. Yeah. So the first CrossFit here in Holland is way back in 2009 and the 2009-2010. So it's just really a young Sports back then so	1.0
Yeah, I did that. I trained in one of the top boxes in San Francisco San Francisco respite for a month. And yeah, it's really impressive. It's really expensive like almost 300 euros dollars a month in the 2014 North 2014. So yeah, we're lucky here Europe. How was your experience? What was different?	1.0
And well, the first thing I really noticed is the intensity of the workouts like in every segment. There's a stimulus that they really explain and that they really hammer it down to you in coaching itself as well.	1.0
So what I get what I was used to here in Holland was really all out 40 minutes amrap or for time with heavy load every single day that	1.0
Heavier bar right more heavy on heavy and intense workout.	1.0
And yeah, eventually you're going to feel it. Mainly if you do not have the skill to recover.	0.0
If you do not have the right technique you're going to eventually pick something up and yeah break your body eventually, right? So that's the first thing I've noticed there's like how they segmented the skill.	0.0
Part because in one of those boxes and Sample service crafted they have the mobility class. They have gymnastic course a class or if they have a weightlifting class all segmented out.	1.0
All right. Yeah, and they can really focus on the skills and slow down.	1.0
So that's what happened.	1.0
There's	1.0
And yeah, even with the other boxes that I have checked in La check couple of boxes there.	1.0
The thing the thing there is like the really are honing the skill first right prioritizing the movements before the intensity. So that's the first thing that I really learn going there. And how was the atmosphere there? Well, yeah, it's because well, I thought that Community feeling mostly in San Francisco because that there's where I spend the most time. Okay.	1.0
So gotten all the people in La it's a little bit Hollywood its type. So when they took up their shirts there you'll really like looks like a model like intimidating. I was taking off my shirt back here. I'm not even that Behave, but I didn't dare to think it took my shirt off. But in any way it's more glamour. It's a little bit. Yeah. It's like I don't know. It's Hollywood. You know, you get what I'm talking about? Yeah. So after I went back, I applied it. So I'm my our pastor was relocated in La so there's no sense to go to Amsterdam anymore.	1.0
So, where did you go? So I've moved to one of the boxes in Harlem and then my brother and BJ followed me there. So let's	1.0
You try to get an internship. Yeah, at first I tried to get an internship there, right? So I don't know why because maybe you my goal here is to train more in the open gyms. So, of course, if you're in turn you're going to get the key and you could use the gym, but it was not so you are not focus on coaching yet. No, not yet. Not yet. So I tried it a couple of times. But due to my my schedule at work, I have two shifts. So I cannot cover all the ships that they are asking for me.	0.0
So they said yeah, it's not really going to work for us.	0.0
And I think it's because I didn't have the the skill yet to coach back then right and they did it really have any system on how to have.	0.0
Yeah, okay.	1.0
So just so you didn't go to did it go both ways. But of course my priority priority back then is not the coach but to compete to have more time to train right? So what I did, okay, I just signed I just signed up myself there to be a member and I bought a set of blades and a mans bar the train. At home. So now home days. There's a back storage. I emptied it up. I throw everything that I that we do not use I bought 18 mats. And of course the the first my first bar is the one without a bearing the VN 1 right, so weird one. No, but it's still in the box so you can see it see it in the Box. Yeah, so I bought that I bought it in Amsterdam. I still remember the day that I bought it's like and then I bought the set of plates together with brother.	1.0
We got it in almere has like a 45-minute drive and it's not even that cheap.	1.0
But back, then it's really hard to get and Equipment because it because this point was he angry or just starting you can just get a go online and buy it online that it's really hard or you're gonna import it into States or into the other countries, which is more expensive if we get everyday real ship that right. So you started to train at home how to train at home was very happy. Not really not really right once I got my first bearing bar. That's the again faster. I bought it online from UK. So this is really expensive because I really want to drop the bar. I don't know what well then the problem with the neighbors games like every time I do it at that even doing it after six just in the morning, but of course Every time I drop the bar the floor is shaking. So, you know, you know how it goes and the house is here in Holland the really too close to each other. It's like after you fart the neighbors could hear it. That's how close it is. So yeah try to minimize that and control all my movements. So it's not really that fun. So I tried to kept going more often to open gyms up into the Says and box that were trained off.	0.0
From time to time. Okay, and you are still like in the training for yourself improving yourself more worrying than athlete. Yeah, when the switch from being an athlete to starving to coach when it happened why it happened.	0.0
Yeah as I Kept doing that training at home invited a couple of friends like Sigma BJ my brother to train with me as well as like it's more fun.	1.0
It can do it with together.	1.0
Yeah. All right, let's so back then. I kind of know if this I have that passions like well, I can't explain the movements right and back dead before I got my in Before I tried to get my internship after I move after I went to States. I got my L1 certification just just just for myself.	1.0
It's not really to open up a business, but just for myself just to get the knowledge to get the knowledge get the right movement.	1.0
I thought but of course L1. Yeah, they will teach you how to move but of course this that's a two to three day class.	1.0
And it's the basics. It's the basics, right? So I kept reading books about movement about training how to train about nutrition and eventually I kind of have a lifestyle that happens. I'm doing like eating clean working out the smoking stop.	1.0
Yeah right from the start the moment.	1.0
They start CrossFit like I go turkey myself stop smoking but back. I'm still drinking but the drinking a eventually Fades away as my daughter grow old.	1.0
So yeah, so I'm straining with the guys and of course I want to involve my wife as well. So from time to time and train with her bought a pair of kettlebells bought a pair of dumbbells, but a pair of rings so I wasn't yeah. It's that bad made up my own plyo box at home. If you check out my Instagram my you will still see the plyo box that I made and it's really scary because as you jump at the top it's really wobbled really you so and yeah while training my wife my wife have a good friend of hers who wants to train as well who have a difficult time losing weight.	1.0
She's old. Wait and having hard time to move. So what we did. Yeah, I asked her it maybe want to train with us.	0.0
I could practice my coaching itself and Yeah, just just just let's see how we how I can help her. All right, so that's really my first kind.	1.0
Yeah, first experience giving a class or giving a writing a workout and executing it in a class setting and this is still at your home in your backyard.	1.0
Yeah. It's still happening at my home back then it was 2014 Summers like from	1.0
May from March.	1.0
Yeah, that's the one that's the one March all the way till September October.	1.0
You can still train outside actually, so we did that and eventually I see the progress in her beginning hit she couldn't do a one purpose.	0.0
What's the time? That's the alarm?	1.0
Because it's not fine but kids but as we go on to this programs like we were training once or twice a week at home. Okay? Yes, like we pick up Tuesdays and Thursdays something like that.	0.0
And that's where we really get into the coaching. Yeah, so as I see her progressing like In the mans weeks that pass by she could do pull-ups. She could do a burpee. She could do a ring Rose now. She's not catching her breath as we do during the workouts, right? I even thought I even gave some basic lifting weight lifting exercise like power cleans and push press like that.	1.0
So she's really improving and yeah, when I saw that like there's something and something in me that this is because back then I was still searching for its did it.	1.0
Is that what I'm going to do and why will be just a warehouse worker and you know, well, I just go to the work working two shifts and go home clean my garden, right? So I was slowly having that thought in me as we move on. Where did it come from? It comes from our community our church Community who giving us Visions like that's really important that you have that community that will guide you through it.	1.0
So yeah, right. So that's where it started like.	1.0
I think I already found it, but I'm not saying it yet to my wife started.	1.0
It's gonna be yeah if we're going to start this. We're going to cut it. So what I did is I approached my pastor and I told him this is before Indians. He leaves and migrated to States. Yeah, we want to open up a small group that we just work out once a week in our congregation. So that's where it really started. So and then you know, they first class.	1.0
Yeah, so Rent a place a small place where you could play basketball and we bought a set of kettlebells, you know, the the plastic kettlebells that we have.	1.0
That's our first set of kettlebells the orange the blue one and the bigger the big Catalyst. Okay and your kids doing these classes once a week for yeah, okay, and when the idea of opening a box well	1.0
It's getting there. It's like a really want to keep doing this.	1.0
So I told to my wife. Hey, how is it hard is it it's really hard to just open up a box because my idea there's like I could have my own place to train because it still looks like yeah, I'm just training two hours a day is like, yeah, it's gonna be much easier if I could have my own place to pay and not travel.	1.0
More too far and we could have a business but what was her reaction?	1.0
Well at first, of course, she she she has her doubts, but my wife always supports me in any decision that I made she's always at my back and that's why I love her for that. So I got my level one actually if we want we could open up the box.	1.0
But where do we get we're going to get the for the the the financials the financial stuff, right?	1.0
So yeah, that's what happened and early summer or early quarter of 2015 all the way up to October.	1.0
So what we did is I got my wet weight lifting course.	1.0
Okay, so you can't like yeah my certificate so I told to do Though her to he has if we're going to do this we need more. We need more words, like need more knowledge into it giving a class. It's for me.	0.0
So we got the weightlifting class and the level 2 and that helped me the most right but the level 2.	1.0
I got it already at the end of the year. So I already giving a class we already so when you when you opened then yeah.	1.0
Let me know afterwards you get to level two.	1.0
So to hone my skills much more and you opened the first location in October 2015, right? Yeah, that that's that. That's where we got the keys and officially we open up our doors November 1st 1st, 2015 16. Okay, so we'll celebrate for years.	1.0
Yeah. It's almost four years. I've always celebrated. With Halloween party, I don't know. What are we going to do this year, but be sure to come make sure you've got here is our box. So any opened in a different location right in the North and then in the old industrial place, so the process looks like this we because back then I was working two shifts. So as my manager if I could just	1.0
In one chip so we could open in the afternoon like give to class in the afternoon and open gym so I could train.	1.0
Yes. He'll die. So next the financial right? I got that going. So we move on to the next step Financial play over we're gonna get financially, how are we going to finance this stuff?	0.0
Like we calculated the things that they need the places that we need to rent how much?	1.0
How big was the stuff came after 30 grams of 30,000 euros? That's our and we went to the BOK to the bank bank to bank with our business proposal. And of course Very, they will say no no way no experience of any kind of business not have enough money in the bank savings, right? Yeah, so they just said no. But one of the bank the olders you could really get it more easier.	0.0
If you're going to personally knowing that that money. Okay, right.	1.0
And of course the Rand is a little bit higher but it's not that it's not that high back then the red is a bit smaller.	1.0
Yeah for personal loans, right?	1.0
So what we did is yeah, we did that went up to our Own bank and we we ask for a personal loan. So we got that the first equipment. No, not yet. Well you need to affiliate first. But before you get affiliate, you need to present a location and etc etc.	0.0
Right.	1.0
So and the name you have to keep getting a location is hard because you need to do to to have a certain certificates and certain license like the parking lights as outside. The noise it need to be certificated. So that's what the first thing. We did we find a place and we talked to the the broker and yeah, we filed a petition for certification for Sports on that building.	1.0
So as we get that then we could move on to affiliate fleeting.	1.0
So I emailed my story to CrossFit age. HQ and then Yeah, they give us a go sign giving us asking us for what will be the name of your box. So send us five names that you think of and back then I don't have any clue. It's like what will be the right thing. So but back then in every move that we made I was really really close to our one of our overseeing pastor who's based in LA, right?	1.0
So, yeah. Yeah, we're asking her.	1.0
Yeah, what will be the name of the Box because that will represent us.	1.0
All right. So yeah, you go to our now.	1.0
We had a couple of names. I don't know anymore.	0.0
Right but we really have almost a two months of forth and back emails and hundreds of names.	1.0
Like I'm I'm I guess I'm headed to names and then Use or it sounds familiar than the with the other back so they won't allow that to use it. I think if the name is cool, they would keep it from this stuff and then we'll just say you cannot use that name because it's really freaking hard just like every time I've came up come up with the name. I'll going to search it there if it's already taken and it's all always.	0.0
Taken crazy. So one time as I told our church Community is into fitness and back then they have the move what you called iron feet right iron feet and that name came from a scripture in Bible like iron sharpens iron. So one man sharpens another right and that's where really there.	0.0
That's where it really	1.0
Came from our names like about that Community about being together. We need gold to each other. Yeah, right and the well, that's our motto as well as like That's what I want to bring here is to bring a positive positive thing to our members lives like right and help each other in any positive way. Yeah, so iron sharpens iron and some days. I don't like have man sharpens another right? So luckily I've got not rejected.	1.0
No. Luckily. We got we got it. And yeah the name sounds cool.	1.0
So yeah, that's where everybody plays CrossFit comes from.	1.0
And I'm really I think yeah. I know I know for sure.	1.0
That's what that's what we're doing right now and I'm really happened. It's really hard to open up a box because man.	1.0
If you want to get rich don't open up a gym. That's my first that's my first yeah advice to you guys. If you're if you're planning to open up a gym don't do it.	0.0
Okay, so you got the name you got the all the licenses and we first of November you opened the gates. Yeah in the other location and you stayed there for a year, right?	1.0
Yeah. We stayed there for a year. I know it's just going to be a stepping stone.	1.0
Stone so we just got the lease for a year.	1.0
It's a small and its really small is like not even the half of this what we're in right now is like 90 square meters with the with the with the with the toilet and changing of the aisle. There's no if there's not no not even a changing room magnet. Yeah. I think you're not gonna sign up to us. So we started In our community are majority of our members are back then are our church members.	0.0
That's good. That's that's and it really helped me a lot to to hone my skills and they are really forgiving right, but I know I need more so I keep studying keep mimicking the greatest coach there is and then I went to L2 it opened up my eyes from some. I'm more and it's really just trying and error. It's like you could never really have one good shot even up to today like always make mistakes. Like I always ask myself. How did the classroom? Oh, I should have done that much better. I should have do this to make it more safer stuff like that, right and keep learning Active Learning. So and then after a year I moved here to this. Goin Fishin afternoon. Yeah after a year were right around 40 members. It says yeah, if you really want to do this we're just going to do it right get a good place that you could feed enough people and to and have more room to grow so we found this place and yeah we moved here in 2016 October exactly what over 15 we got the Kia Soul.	1.0
Well, I don't know. What would that number and we have week of moving out moving our stuff out back. Then we do the thumb much stuff. So everything is removed within a day. We believe it or not and we bought some floorings. I have a just built it up together with the couple of members.	0.0
We set up the rig and it's really fun because you could really see that there's there there's a culture there's a community of Helping each other in any kind of situation like and I like it's like yeah, that's what you want to build here. Yeah, right that thing is like yeah, it's more than a money I suppose. Yeah, and since then they are gradually growing and building more people's outside more equipment equipment and we we keep making ourselves better service wise right facility wise. So this coming season we will have some changes in the Box make sure you watch out for that. It's in the making I'm really excited that the way yeah me too. Right it's going to be more so and what's the what's the goal?	1.0
Well, I go or not our goal our goal now, is that as we move on Of course, of course if I could provide to my family I could go full time here.	1.0

That's that whip cracking down on. Neil the way it ever occur to you I should look for $600 litter box. Well considering my girl someone pointed it out to you and said listen this is going to be not yours anymore.

Oh suck on that Todd and I actually you have a vagina know I had to clean the litter box and realize I'd much rather pay money then have to clean out a fucking litter box. Also, it's a litter box that cleans itself. Yeah, it dumps. Where were you at? So what you cleaned it one time? Yeah. I love this. I respect to show how does it clean except a little legs pop-up.

Well, that's that's good news to hear and it's great news to hear that everybody physically is okay and it's just a horrible horrible thing. Take care of the planet people. So why we're saying take care of the planet only when I give describe your military career basically for us it seems to me that you basically	1.0
Lee were the Australian version of a Navy SEAL for us it's accurate it's similar, but it's not exactly the same there are elements that we do the same job as crossovers but the Navy SEAL do a lot more soldiering than we do, you know, the clearance divers aren't generally getting chop it into war zones to go and assassinate terrorists and things like that. So we do attack swimming and mine clearance and reconnaissance with And even reconnaissance on land underwater explosive Ordnance disposal as well as land-based bomb disposal as well. So there is a lot of crossovers but it's not exactly the same.	0.0
Okay, so you basically you are what the the seals were before they became the seals underwater demolition divers what they were yeah, very cool.	1.0
Yeah. Okay now closer to the traditional problem.	1.0
Yes, absolutely.	1.0
Well, but with way better tools technology has come a long way. Like what just to the diving equipment itself? Yeah, pure oxygen rebreathers, the mixed-gas non-magnetic rebreathers that we use to dive on mines under water so that the magnetically charged Minds won't activate when they detect us all of the equipment, you know, diamond-tipped massive chain saws that can cut through concrete the broco underwater putting guns that can burn through basically anything on Earth under water. All of the safety equipment for the power shooting in the Foss driving out of helicopters and just it's you know, it's a big boys toy club. We get to play with millions of dollars worth of Cool Tech and then blow stuff up. It's a win-win that's incredible.	1.0
So with all right, so I was a diver for the State Police in Indiana back in the day. There's a long time ago. I Technologies change. We are equipment with so crude. I can't imagine what it's like for divers now, especially	0.0
Elite divers like the team you're on like how long can you be under water at any given time before you would have to come up for air many hours how many hours because that's a beauty of the real because it recirculates your own from your body has a carbon dioxide absorb in inside it that absorbs that CO2 and then you basically just keep rebreathing and the little tanks of gas whether they be oxygen or nitrogen. Helium for deep diving they just squirt a little bit of extra air in so the little tanks last way longer so we could we would do a tax swims in the middle of the night for anywhere up to three hours.	1.0
That's amazing this what is it? What's the deepest you've ever gone underwater 90 meters.	1.0
So that's tongs by three about 280 feet.	1.0
That's a long way.	1.0
Yeah, that's a long time to get there and it's been longer to get back.	1.0
Yeah, so I don't remember Were the formulas or any of that stuff? I was I think I went a hundred and thirty feet was the deepest ever did and at that level you went twice that it felt. So weird like everything compressed. I remember I had to keep tightening my weight belt because everything shrinks from the pressure. Yeah you deeper and you get knocked.	1.0
Yes and coming out to knock out Isis. It's like being really really drunk.	1.0
Yes. Yeah. Yes exactly felt like really being drunk. So are you going to come up? So like I forget Is it 15 meters and you get a stop for like 15 minutes or something like that?	1.0
No did not get the bends it really depends on how long you've been under and how deep he's gone. And the gas you breathing on it can all change depending on if you're breathing on oxygen or nitrogen or helium. The different depths. You have to stop at the different periods of time. You have to stop at and I remember the first time that I did it will do her in still in training and we were doing Bounce dive, so just basically down and up on a helmet to about 60 meters about a hundred eighty feet through sixes open. Yeah hundred eighty eight and my we always dive with bodies when possible because it's a dangerous business and it's nice to have someone there to back you up, but my body couldn't clear his is and so I had to go down by myself. And this is just outside the heads of Sydney Harbour and this is a great white shark highway is tiger sharks as bullshit. And so I have to sit at my what we call a wet. Stop a decompression stop at about 15 meters for 10 minutes. And I feel like the smallest most indefensible worm on a hook. I've who's so exposed in the middle of the ocean.	0.0
Just dangling on a rope waiting for a shark to come out of the murk speaking of sharks for those people don't know I mentioned it briefly which is a huge like understatement was passed by so quickly. Glee shark attack Survivor people need to know that you you lost an arm and you lost a leg. You lost a hand Okay Hand.	1.0
Yeah. I love my hand and said the shock took my right hand and all of my right hand string in one bot and I ended up losing the rest of the lightest. Oh, I'm now above knee amputee and in Deputy what how did this?	1.0
Occur, where were you what happened?	1.0
We were in Sydney Harbour. This is 2009 in February, which is the end of Summer from Australia. So it's usually the hottest period of the year, but it was it was early morning. It was still pretty chilly and we were doing some testing of new equipment for the R&D Department of the military just unmanned video and sonar that wood was attempting to track and detect us. As we were swimming through the water and was right alongside the Navy base in Sydney Harbor place called woolloomooloo. And this is a place where we dive in work all the time. We've been there for decades. No one's ever been attacked. There hasn't been an attack in Sydney Harbour in 60 years. So it's pretty safe as far as all things go, but I was terrified of sharks. Also.	1.0
I'm like one of my worst by the way, that's a phobia. I also share. Yeah. I've never been close to a shark Whatever by Justice Zoom in when I get in the ocean, I'm just always terrified.	0.0
Yeah, and we will you know is the police divers. Well, most of our diving is done water where you can barely even see your hand in front of your face.	0.0
That's the only diving I've ever done just muddy. Yeah, it's Rivers is I've never had the pleasure of being in the ocean. I assume it's awesome except for sharks. So go ahead about yeah.	1.0
Yeah, you get pumped by stop and you just say, oh that was just a log or something. It's Rick yourself inside. I've had my knee. A guy in the water first for the first 30 minutes he a swimming up and back up and back and it's equipment trying to detect him and I decided to do him a good turn and I said just jump out mate. Let me take over take a break and I jump in the water in a black wetsuit a pair of black fins, and I'm on the surface on my back. Just moving from point A to point B, and I look over my left shoulder to make sure that I'm still headed towards the bow of the warship that I'm supposed to be attacking and before I can turn back I You have a huge whack in my leg and it didn't really hurt but it just kind of shocked me and I turned around to look and there's just a massive shock head touching me and takes me feels like seconds to work out what's going on because I've never even seen a shock and all of a sudden is this, you know, it's like Shark Week has come to life in front of me while I'm swimming and I don't really know what to do. And I think the shark knows what to do either because it's kind of staring at me and we try to work. You out if I'm food, and then so my survival instincts kick in and I think all right. I've seen the crocodile hunter. I've seen Shark Week over our job it in the eyeball. So I tried but I can't move my arm and I looked down and I can see the teeth embedded into my wrist and every time I try and pull it I can see the flesh tearing I was so I think nothing left hand I go to the eyeball with my left and I reach over but I can't reach it and in short side grab it by the nose and try to push it off, but that Is the type of the lower jaw deeper into the back of my leg. So I cut back to try and punch it in the nose and by that stage the Sharks decided on food and starts to shake me and that's when the paint kicks in like a hundred teeth razor-sharp teeth on either side of your limb moving in unison to tear through your flash and all of the fight went out of them took me under water and I was just yelling and I was in agony and we popped up and I took it. Breath and then it took me back under and just kept thrashing me around like a rag doll and I realized how powerful it was nothing I could do and so I realized that I was going to die and I remember thinking to myself. I'm not going home today. I'm going to die right now and it was strange because it wasn't like times flow down. I think our bodies and our minds are such incredible machines and my mind went into hyperdrive and I started running. My life is hanging. Okay, am I ready to die and I thought well shit no coming from where I started out as a really lost and bad kids self-harming and drugs and all that stuff and fighting and stealing to where I had achieved Peace Keeping with the UN and the elite of the Navy and all that sort of stuff and I thought you know what I'll come further than I've ever thought possible if I'm going to die now I have no regrets. I'm ready to go. And so I let go and I was ready to drift away and the A shark at that point ripped through the rest of my leg and took my hand off and because it wasn't attached to me anymore. My wet suit made me boy and I'll pop to the surface and I realized that I wasn't dead and I thought shit. I got to get out of here before it comes back and I saw my safety boat with my three teammates in and I start to swim to the safety boat. But as soon as I take a stroke, I can see my hands gone. It just my arm ends at the end of my wetsuit and my medical training kicks in and I think I've got to keep that wound above my heart to stem the bleeding. So I've got one out of the water swim back to the boat with one hand and one leg because I can't even feel my right leg. I don't know what's wrong with it at this point. I just can't feel it. And the guys in the safety boat said I was literally swimming through a pool of my own blood and they said when they came in closer, he was actually so stick they could taste it in the air and I just I didn't think I was going to make it. I thought there's so much blood in the water sharks will come back and other sharks going to smell it and I'm going to die. I'm just waiting for a shock to grab me. By the other leg and it just never came so I just kept swimming back to the boat and eventually the guys got to me pulled me out of the water and just out of the sheer relief of not being eaten any more. I relax my eyes rolled back in my head and I pass out and my mate almost brings into action and his training tells him. I'm going into cardiac arrest and he needs to stimulate my heart. So he straddles me and he starts pummeling me in the chest. I'm trying to wake me back up and and it work. And I wake up and I look over and my hands gone freshly bitten off by a shark and I look up and tell me who's beating the shit out of me and I just think today sucks.	0.0
So did they not hear or see the attack that you had to swim back to the boat?	0.0
They couldn't come to you they were coming towards me at the same time. They were pretty far away though.	0.0
Yeah. Okay, so I assume by this by the way, you described initially seen your And in your leg in Jeopardy at the same time was this shark big enough that it's bite like trapped your right arm against your leg. So your hand and your the back of your leg were in its mouth at the same time.	1.0
Yeah. Absolutely. That's what I'm trying to show that measured The Bite in my wet suit and my leg said that it was between two point seven three meters. So so about 9 foot 9 or 10 foot long. So it was it was Much bigger than I was just sure sheer power.	1.0
I mean usually you'd be helpful in its environment. I mean I've seen pictures of you you are a physical specimen and you felt completely powerless. I mean, that's one hell of a show.	0.0
You can watch it. It's on YouTube.	1.0
I'm going to watch it.	1.0
I'm going to watch it was it was part of the exercise. The unmanned video on Sonar was recordings. So I was trying it and it recorded the attack, you know, it's not great quality. Yeah, but you can see it.	1.0
So there was an underwater camera that captured this whole thing was on the surface on the surface. Okay, man.	1.0
Yeah, you see the thrashing see couple of black things. I mean you see me swimming away. What type of shark was they said it was a bull shark by the type of bite but you know, some people have said they think it was a great white because it came up from underneath me. And also there was a great white attack the next day at Bondi were a surfer lost his hand.	1.0
So This you're underwater for that long. And basically you're fighting for your life. And at some point you just kind of have to come to terms with it and peacefully accept that this is the end like that that's a long time. I assume it seemed like forever. However long it really took but is like can you even describe was it like almost like an out-of-body experience? Like when you finally accept death, you're like I'm here was there it was there any kind of weird?	1.0
Associated with that outside of these really like that, you know, not a lot out of body or anything like that, but this is monologue going on in your home. Yeah. It was just I have absolutely no fear of death anymore because I know that death isn't scary, you know, being a parent and being attacked by a shark yet terrifying really but death itself and going on to whatever is next. It's actually quite peaceful and the First thing that I think now is well, the only reason that was was because I had no regrets and I had nothing no thoughts of I should have done this or I should made up with this person. So now it's like, okay. So all I've got to do for next time I die is make sure I feel that exact same way. So now I get to really really live because there is no fear of death. There's no having to hold on to the Mortal coil. I get to be anyone I want to do anything. I want I'm happy and all I have to do is just have no regrets and they loving to everyone and help where I can and now I just really changed the whole direction of my life and my mindset so you're saying is the key to happiness is to just almost died and then live it.	1.0

Without good leaves the leg the leg is heavily this never lose a hand.	0.0
Okay, so that you're saying it's worse to have lost the hand in the like absolutely 100. That was our guest.	0.0
You can rip you can replace a leg Yeah leg is it's great, but you can replace it. There's not that many moving Parts. You need a knee and ankle and while they're not, you know, it's not replicatable to Perfection like You're like a human leg. They're pretty damn good now but a hand they have not worked out how to do that because you have multiple moving joints that move instinctually you can feel where they are. There's sorry complicated and the robot hands don't even come close. My robot hand is amazing. It's the best in the world. It's about $90,000, but it's a $90,000 beer can holder.	0.0
Thanks so much for answering that cuz I was sweating a little bit to ask you that I thought was this is this disrespectful but really I mean in this day and age you see, you know amputees without a leg they come back from combat or whatever and then the technology is so good. You almost don't even notice a gate in their walk and they can run competing all these things. But yeah, it makes so much sense. There's so much more going on with the hand. It's going to take a lot longer for that technology to get to the same. Level Paul, do you still dive a lot? And if you do, what was it like At first time going back in the water?	1.0
So I do time. The first time was amazing. It was three months to the day after the shark attack and I just had two stitches and Staples out of my leg. And all I wanted to do was get back in the water and two of my mates came over and they took me down to Bondi with a couple of surfboards and I was really paranoid about it because As a really populated beach in so I felt embarrassed and self-conscious and I've got my eight foot board under my arm and the paparazzi were there taking photos and so it was pretty hard to deal with but I'm hoping down through the soft sand and I get to the water and I can maneuver my way to about waist deep and I put my board down and the only thing I was worried about was I just whispered to myself. Please don't let me paddle around in a circle. I didn't I nearly drowned smashed by every single way. But eventually I got out the back and I was in the song sitting on my board with my mates and it felt so freaking good and you know, I try to remind myself that a lot when the running blade actually hurts a lot when I run I don't enjoy running that much anymore. But I remember how good I felt after I made that huge effort to get down to the beach to Get out into the waves, you know, it's not always about the struggle of doing something. It's about the happiness at the end and knowing and they're just living and that that it motivates me to get up off my ass a lot of the time when the alarms going off at 5:00 and I'm like, I don't want to go to the gym. It's cold out and but I know that feeling will come as soon as I'm out there doing it and living and so I always give myself a bit of a mental uppercut and Y'all started live. I've never ever regretted that but I've definitely regretted not doing things.	1.0
But now the recovery how long did it take before you got back to feeling like doing these things? I assume that was a long process.	1.0
I went back to work full-time after six months. Wow. Are you serious? Yeah. So one of my greatest be the will the greatest be wasn't about Losing the leg in the hand. It was about losing my career because it's called it was it was everything to me. I loved it and I fought so hard to achieve that and I was terrified of losing it and so instead of letting that fear crippled me. I used it as a motivator and I let it push me into die with you know, just two days after my legs chopped off. I'm trying to do one-handed pull-ups on the bar above my bed so that I can start training and then I went home and I had one of my best friends who Really was a savior. He quit his job up north moved in with me and act as a carer and cooked for me and clean for me and drove me around. I really couldn't have done it without him. You can't undervalue the just the smallest amount of support in these situations. And so I was in the gym at the army base every single day training learning to use my body again working with the prosthetic companies to try and develop weightlifting Prosthetics. And so yeah over a year and a half to have three More surgery to remove bone spurs and that was always very hard progressing and then going in for surgery and going back to square one again. So that was pretty emotionally draining and having to get back on the drugs again, and I was self-administering Oxycontin and own which is the fast-acting oxy Gabapentin, which is a nerve blocker antidepressants for the nerve pain sleeping tablets. And so I could smash as much of that in my head as I wanted, but I kind I knew what it was like to live in a cloud. Cloud from when I was a teenager and I was smoking heaps a weed and was working in Hospitality doing other party drugs and I swore to myself. I wouldn't go back to that person. And so I got off the drugs as fast as I could got back to work and just started trying to prove myself that I deserve to be there.	1.0
I assume you created the light of that mental toughness and fortitude from your military career. I mean you were special forces guy there in Australia, not technically not special.	1.0
It's a department of the Navy.	1.0
Okay. Okay. Now what year did you leave military service?	1.0
So I joined the Airborne unit November 2000 transferred over to the Navy April 2005 and left full-time. Service August 2012.	1.0
Okay, and when did you first come to the states?	1.0
The first time was actually on request by the US Navy they're having a diving conference and they asked me to come out and speak out it in San Diego. And so that share that was like two thousand and two thousand twelve or 13, I think and that was my first trip in San Diego beautiful. Yeah. It's all right absolutely fell in love with that town.	1.0
So what did you think about the state's what? How did how did you think about the diving practices compared to what you guys Is dead is it all the same or very similar?	1.0
It's all very similar. But the difference is you guys have Specialists. Sorry, there's a department specifically working or H sort of thing that we do so you have salvaged and repair unit that works with the tools and uses the helmets. Then you have an underwater bomb disposal unit. Then you have the Tactical operations team. Then you have the land-based EOD whereas we don't have as much as many people as you and so the current starters we have to do all of that. So it's an interesting but it's hard to remember a lot of stuff. So it was really cool to just come out and meet with everyone and I made lifelong friends from that trip. Any one of those guys is my best friend to this day and the water spins the opposite way, correct? Yeah, exactly. You know, I kind of fell in love with it and America has this really romantic sort of feel for Australians because we all grow up watching. It on TV and in the movies, and and so when I got the opportunity to come out here all a jumped on it and I love living out this see that's how we feel about our show you is that we have very romanticized absolutely.	1.0
So tell me about what you have going on. Now you some advocacy work and tell me about what's going on with Indigo Industries scuba equipment because you are one of the best divers to ever do it and I assume that's why you work for them. What kind of cool shit are you doing with them?	1.0
I'm sorry. I got a contract with Discovery Channel to host Shark Week a couple of years ago. So I've been hosting shows on Shark Week. How good does that feel?	1.0
How good did that feel to be able to host Shark Week the coolest show we have of all time dude.	1.0
It is mind-blowing. Yes. I can't even believe I get to do this I get paid to go and do things that I would pay to do and then I get a little home movie out of it and everyone gets to watch it around the world. Yes. Absolutely, amazing eyesight. They pay for me to do incredible things that people don't get to do I swim with great white sharks without a cage where she does that although it is kind of like every year makes me wonder how Discovery Channel's going to try and kill me this year and last year. I did a survival show with a British Special Forces Guy where we parachuted from 15,000 feet directly into the Pacific Ocean for 44 hours with no food. No water surrounded by sharks was the fairgrounds or else? No, not the Bear Grylls last night. It was a guy called James glancing who was a royal Marine 44 hours at the ocean. Yeah. That was it's a long time. These aren't you can understand how hard it is when you're bouncing around the ocean. You're tired. You're hungry you're thirsty and trying to cut. Hole in the butt of your wet suit while you're moving around too. So you can poop student suit. You can't sleep in the suit get a rash. Yeah, I thought that was the second one the E before they blew up our boat off the coast of the Bahamas and we drifted through the ocean again through the Atlantic surrounded by Oceanic whitetip sharks, which are the sharks blame for the biggest shark attack in history the at the sinking of the USS Indianapolis. So there was Reportedly 300 American Sailors were eat by these sharks. So it was kind of you know, I wasn't just a survival thing was a message about shark conservation and what to do if you're stranded and you lose your boat, but also telling the story of these Sailors, so it was a really great thing to be a part of was there any part of you?	1.0
Also was there any part of you when you're getting these requests we like hey guys already did the shark thing like I lived I don't be running more sharks.	1.0
Okay at this point. Gone, like if I'm genuinely fearful for my life while I'm waiting the treatment of the show. I'm pretty much sure I'm going to do it. Yeah, so I know there's another one we did last year where we are on the back of the boat, and we wanted to test this Blood myth where you know, sharks can smell a drop of blood in 10,000 legs of ocean. And so we went to the Bahamas and there was 25 feet of water with tiger sharks bull sharks hammerhead sharks nurse sharks everywhere and we drained half a liter of My Blood Out It into a bag and I jumped off the back of the boat and swam away and then ripped open the bag. I was surrounded by this huge plume of my blood just to see what would happen in hindsight that doesn't seem very clever. It was kind of fun.	1.0
They did it what was going to happen?	1.0
Yeah, they do nothing absolutely nothing so they can't smoke that in Nightmare not attracted to our blood at all. I've seen sharks ate poop. But I haven't seen him that you know, they just done the guys threw a bucket of fish pond off the back of the boat after that and I had to swim through that and that absolutely changed their demeanor that went total predatory and I had to stop calling him off.	1.0
So they're gonna be all over me.	1.0
I saw this guy with one leg and one doing things that normal people can't do all want to be and they're just It sparked that interest that made them want to create some adaptive diving here. And these guys have been making equipment for the Special Forces all around the world for a long time. It really could have they make such incredible new Ingenuity equipment that you know, it's just really great to use. I love it that just designed me a set of my own sins. We started this line called The Bionic AF, you know what that means? So the probably got a bionic a offline with short travel easy carbon fiber sins that are super super light and I like them short because I can't maneuver as well anymore with my diving leg my robotic diving leg because it doesn't really Bend at the knee whenever I want it to like you would if you're spinning with your normal leg. And so having these really long freediving sins and bulky scuba Sims makes it harder. So that made these really short wide powerful carbon fiber. Thins that I just amazing and then travel bags you can put all your stuff in a really awesome day say that's perfect for traveling really light really easy to use for me with one hand. So it's just cutting it back to the Simplicity of making diving not so complicated so we can just enjoy it.	1.0
That's incredible man. I tell you why I am we get we get a list of guests sent once or twice a week and we get to go through them and decide who we want on our we don't and I'm so glad we said yes to you. I mean you you are just a badass you're a badass with that different kind of mindset and I'm thankful that you you made it through everything you did and not only that the like you're a champion now for others who are a PT's and you're doing some good shit out there man. So I wanted everybody to know that they need to get a hold of your book. No time for fear. How a shark attack Survivor beat the odds. I'm assuming it's available everywhere books are can be found Amazon and everywhere else and your website. Is that Paul De gelder.com?	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. And that basically has a link to my speaking that I do. So now I'm out here. I'm traveling around America. I'm off to Kansas City Missouri for my first trip next Wednesday to go and speak at a big conference. I've done Amazon Snapchat. Viacom Microsoft like all the big companies and I just love it. I really really enjoyed getting out speaking to these companies and these businesses and people and just sharing all of the things I've learned about life and all of these cool stories and just lighting a fire up that everyone's asses so that they start to live again because people go through shit, you know what it's like you don't know what the person next to you is going through. We all have these Amazing Stories and struggles and sometimes we just need that. That fire lit up under ass again. And so that's what I love to do aside from chocolate.	1.0
I want to run through a wall right now. Absolutely. I need to go here you watch you speak some point. You're not a guy that needs a bunch. But can I give you some anyway made white cut out. I said, you don't necessarily a guy that needs advice. But can I give you some anyway, oh, absolutely.	1.0
I'm always open to advice.	1.0
You're going to Kansas City, Missouri. So you're going to get a lot of recommendations for barbecue you	1.0
Need to go to a diner on one of those guys and there's a reason for it. It's because I went to Africa to shoot a documentary and I was working with a really brilliant guy called dynein Manda and he found he's an Australian Navy clearance diver. Also who founded the International anti-poaching Foundation and he started the first all-female run from the anti-poaching Rangers to the managers to the staff to the H all female run from Broken backgrounds abandoned by their tribes and Villages domestic abuse women and he's down in them together to fight poaching in Africa and I was there filming with him and he didn't eat me and that just blew my mind. I'm like why the hell would you like one big and I'm like what the hell is happening? I don't think me and I said why you know, I grew up. I love meat. I eat ate all the kangaroos in the world and he said we'll look I was out here trying to protect the animals and then I go home and I'd eat the animals and I felt like a hypocrite and that kind of run of bell with me and I thought well shit, I'm doing that with the oceans and I'm eating animals and I hate hypocrites, you know in the military were trained to lead by example to do as I do not as I say and so I always drive to be that sort of person so I can't justifiably go out into the world and say hey you need to protect sharks and look after our oceans and look after our environment if I'm going home and I'm contributing to the destruction and so very very slowly and I'm talking very slowly. I started canceling out different things and expanding my repertoire of vegetables and Grains and all that sort of stuff and I've been plant-based for nearly four years now and I love it. I'll never go back why I thought feel healthy strong. I didn't lose any muscles, you know, I didn't grow boobs for meeting so food, and I haven't had a single injury training in four years.

Welcome to the wrong culture podcast. My name is Dane ver way. I'm an experienced Runner and running physiotherapist. I created this podcast not only so I had an excuse to talk running each and every week something that I love to do, but more importantly this podcast gives me the opportunity to interview fellow Runners friends and health professionals in a relaxed and easygoing format. This podcast is designed for the everyday Runner so we can all live learn. Grow and enjoy everything there is to running together. I hope you enjoy the show. Welcome back to episode 17 of the wrong culture podcast today. I interviewed a man Clark one of the athletes are coach from the Run culture hours. This is the third time I've caught up with Damien over the past six months. Although as you'll hear today's episode is a little bit different Damien's had a setback. He's recovering from an injury. He's had a month off running. Whereas over the past 2 episode Damien couldn't put a foot wrong. To in pee I have to pee. I love this podcast episode for a number of reasons one because I feel like a lot of people can learn from it anyone who's currently injured. I think we'll be able to learn and just sympathize with Damien over the past month and what he's going through. Damien also shows a fair bit of maturity in this episode. He's learned a lot since he had a major injury this time last year and he's definitely gone about this injury a whole heap better in terms of how he's viewed it and and Managed IT. He certainly has stopped listen to it and tried to get on top of it straight away. I also liked this episode because it shows that her load management isn't in tight tirely. The reason for this injury. So we've Damien. Yeah, he missed last season's track season and then we started introducing spikes so that it could do his 1500 and 5K races. And yeah, he's got saw in his foot because he started to use this. Spike's more but really the way that we introduced the spikes was very slow. And a lot of people would have been able to tolerate this load. So it shows that how how everyone's different and we learn from our experiences. So Damien and I will be better for this. We all know that okay, we have to ease our way forward and slowly build Damien's tolerance to track spikes and the speed work involved on the track. And this will come all right enough for me. I hope you enjoyed the episode. Okay, here we are again with Damian Clark and I will catch up.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah just catching you before Jim as well. And then you're off to Phillip Island today.	1.0
Yeah, that's it. Kind of wait school. He's not really schoolies trip you'd call that that's awesome.	1.0
Because last time we caught up you were and meets all your study and you hadn't done your exams yet. So it must be a relief.	1.0
Yeah, well past that now so glad it's over most later results next week next Thursday. Yeah, we have today. Yeah next week nervous. So I'm just anticipating it. Yep. Yeah, it's want it back.	1.0

Yeah. Yeah so good. You can just get to places now a bit more independently. Yeah, it's fantastic. And then so it's happened to also, you know from a running front and an injury front this time around and I think it's important to touch base and report on because like we said from the start we're going to report the ups and downs of It's not all smiles and Reva. Yeah, that's it. It's not all positives. But there certainly were still a few positives this this time around like like I said last time we're going to do a few fifteen hundreds and and you ended up doing a few in October had they go.	1.0
Yeah good finally cracked 4:30. Yeah just was like 429 six or something that he did it twice. I did it twice to it once a day and then the following Saturday around no 429 just that into	1.0
Club meets.	1.0
Yeah, just maybe Shield.	1.0
Yeah, how did those races feel good.	1.0
That's the first time I've ever really I can still wear my watch but I felt was unnecessary. Yeah, like I was I didn't check my watch at all like that all around it as a race and then I got good times out of it and still felt like looking back. I still feel like I got more to give and yeah, just enjoy the race. Yeah. Yeah, so take whatever.	1.0
Nana's is great. So you felt like you were getting some speed and we're certainly trying to do a few more speed sessions as well on the track. And then we got to the three 3 ke early November and this was sort of did you finish the exams what this stage?	1.0
That was the day of my last?	1.0
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, finally pressure was off a little bit but must have been a bit of a surreal feeling doing that race. Ace after all the pressure you'd be putting on yourself a lot of emotions like that. Yeah would have been a funny day.	1.0
Yeah, and I'll light race to get look quite like wasn't it's like 9 o'clock start. Yeah, definitely very different to what I'm used to.	0.0
Yeah. So this was the first mileage club and it was at Duncan McKinnon in Glen Huntley that morandini ass track. And yeah, I thought you look fantastic like you certainly piece together. A good sort of 1500 two k's in that race and and your Technique looked really good and you you certainly look like you had a new new few gears and then it just sort of got your late in the race.	1.0
Yeah, really set it off in this at the start. But yeah, I've known Carly say what happens at the end. Yeah, but again, I didn't check my watch for the whole race or just going off the splits and so still getting a lot better at running it as a race. Yeah, but yes, I'm just happened to that last Caleb. I lost it and get kind of fell apart towards the end.	0.0
It's okay. Like that's that's running. I like it's very rare that you hit your first 3K of the season and nail it like it's often often takes a few goes and just it's a different type of writing, isn't it? Then cross country? Yeah, definitely, but if you learn yeah, yeah, but even just that pace, so what did you go through 1K in and what did you go through? A to KN. Can you can you remember what they call it out?	1.0
He was like 306 for the first K and then just over free 10 for the second K. Yeah, and then the last one I thought over 324 last time.	1.0
Yeah.	1.0
Yeah. Yes. I mean I still like brand under 10 minutes so may not take it.	1.0
Yeah, exactly and I mean conditions aside because it wasn't the best day.	0.0
He is miserable with like Lane ones for	0.0
what'd you hapless? Yeah, and I think many people had really good days time was that day? I don't think there was many PV so now but then after that, yeah, just the the sore foot over the weekend after that was kind of turn for the worst kind of Sunday.	0.0
I'm a long runs and 60 minutes and felt this sharp pain at the fucking before foot. It didn't go away for Around yep, their messages are away and godly fear in the worst.	0.0
Yeah, so we had a look at it. I'm sure the next day and it was like pretty sore close to the second metatarsal. So I was like or yeah, but this could just because you're using Sparks more and doing a bit more speed, but we'll just be honest the quarter side and cross train for the week and try to calm it down with some ice and some some anti-inflammatories and And then we looked at it another week later and I still was no greater Yeah, we actually had to pull out of the 5K chance that way because well second time here at he's like second year running.	0.0
Yeah II II II you're not running.	1.0
Yeah. So that's the aim for 2020 is to get to that Vic 5K Champs and and actually start the race.	1.0
Yeah, so had the week off cross-training and spin bike.	1.0
And then try to get the next Monday for 20 minutes and that was not pretty yeah, and so like we said, okay well and then I really assess it and it was sore still in that same area and and knowing that you came off a stress fracture last year. We treated it as more a bony injury. So so we ended up deciding to have we didn't get a scan but we've had Three weeks off running and then we're just gradually trying to introduce a little bit of running now to see how it is. So hoping that is just an early stage bone reaction and and then you can slowly get back into running bit legit like we laugh about it now, but that was quite a frustrating time for you like missing that 5K because luckily sort of reported in one of those earlier podcast like we've had some Ames with your 5K and on the track. It's a really good environment. I meant to do a good 5K time. So it was quite frustrating but I thought like you're dealt with it. Well, how did you feel like you handled it?	0.0
Yeah, it's best I could yes are they kind of just go switch in once it comes with straps yourself? Yep. Take it forward. It is like there's not much I can do about it now and I've liked it. He said coming off an injury last year where I ran through the injury and just made it so much worse. I mean he had to take months off. Mr. Rice, then miss a number five.	0.0
Yeah, and I think that's like so much you were like a such a great mindset because yeah, you met Miss three weeks and running but you don't miss you know, four months of running consistently. So your Fitness, you know dropped a little bit but not like it would if you miss four months, so yeah, so you like that's so good luck to you all. Learning from one of your first major injuries and and I feel like the way you've gone about this one has been really good and so far we couldn't have done any better in terms of settling it down because as soon as you got saw you responded we looked at it and we've gone about trying to settle it down like which is yeah. I mean, it's fantastic like I would recommend that to anyone back home like if you've got got An injury respond respond to it straight away. But at the same time how do you know what's an injury like often? We've all got Nichols as Runners and if we get to to responsive to niggles, then we wouldn't run. Yeah. So how did you know that it just you couldn't run it's a different kind of pain.	1.0
It's like it was so localized. It was just sharp. Yeah, and it was it was hurting to run. Yeah. It wasn't just like a knee. Because you push through is yeah and you came in here and you couldn't hop could you know, like just simple stuff like everyday stuff that yes.	0.0
Yes interfering with exactly and that that that's a really good point. I mean like stuff interfering with your daily life. You were limping a little bit.	1.0
Oh, it sounds limping but it would mean like I could really like take sharp turns and like yeah, like if I had 200 black really over rotate my foot it would yeah, it wouldn't be right.	0.0
Yeah, and yeah see you put on these big white Nike shoes for your couple of weeks. Yeah.	1.0
Yeah, they had a bit of cushion prove it of support under the foot.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, it's great. And so earlier this week we assess it again and we assess it last week last week. We said you were ready this week. We got on the treadmill and you are able to do five. I mean it's end and after hopping on it and pushing it it passed. So now I've decided to start running.	1.0
What have you done so far so laughter and some initial tests last week, which was good.	1.0
But not yeah, it was pretty close, but it's still just wasn't like there. Was that stiff feeling there?	0.0
Yeah, it's I'll go couldn't give a full conference last week. But so took the weekend off and then you have a 5 meter run and then that looks pretty good pretty promising. So then yesterday I did another 10 minutes add another 5 minutes. And again, it's feeling pretty promising. I'm pretty confident. Yes, no real issues as of yet.	1.0
Yeah. So we've sort of set you up with a really slow Progressive run return to run program over the next day, you know ten days or so and we'll just see we'll just be really responsive each day. Tell how it seems to react I think you sort of at the stage where it was a hot spot. Like it's really calm down and a little bit of running were actually be good for it. But just a little bit.	1.0
Yeah every I don't know five minutes each day.	1.0
Yeah, exactly. So now like readjusting and re-evaluating sort of where you're at. What are the goals?	1.0
Let's assume we're still looking at that 5K still seeing how close I can get to a national school fire by the end of the season. Yep.	1.0
Like tent that's 1545.	1.0
Yeah snow really set selection criterias and released yet. But I'm 1540 of English we say yeah. They have like it's only December. I've got until like march/april Stewart heaps of time. Yeah, see I am for that 5K still really can on I've had to pull out of 10 K last night as well. So it's a really keen on that's right.	1.0
That was Abby's out of that effect.	0.0
Yeah, and I would have been in the div 1 here. Yep. Yeah, so I was coming it's kind of frustrating but I definitely like to have another crack because we see the results for that. However long Look for California.	0.0
Yeah, you haven't seen them either. I know Michael conahan and Dion finocchiaro. We're running it.	1.0
Yeah. See, I definitely like to have another crack later in the season if possible. Yeah, that's my goal is to see it for the tracks easy. Yeah, maybe you know freak A 4 comes up.	1.0
But yeah, I think that's the idea for my track cool and then obviously it's going to be a bit of a I mean you just have to wait and see like how your marks going next week and then and then he's at January where you decide like what's happening next year in terms of uni, or whoever some so I get results next Thursday, and it was like a change of preference period	1.0
I can re-evaluate where I want to go and change your preferences for mean he's what dates that so the first round offers coming up the following Wednesday the 18th. So I could I could know where I'm going two weeks. Okay, if I get enough of them and there's some office it come out in January. Yeah, I think I should definitely know by January. Yeah what I'm doing the life.	1.0
Yeah. Yeah, and then what have you got planned because like this is probably some of the best best years of your life really like where you have these massive summer holidays where you finish finish in November and then don't start again until Feb March. What else have you got planned? You obviously got the Phillip Island trip. You got anything planned over Christmas or January?	1.0
Third of it, like my mom with the virus. That's the way together. Yeah, you know work or you know away push work for more hours. Bo we going so I feel bad today and be work you're in there hopefully running a bit more soon. Yeah, that's it. And then we going away again at the end of January of the Australia Day weekend sweet where you going go to Painesville. Oh, yeah, bring the boat. Yeah, that's very it for a while. What is have Christmas go so family coming down for lunch and the that's about it. Maybe big New Year's party.	1.0
Yeah, very good. Well, I think that's a good update or one other things with your cross training. You've been on the bike a bit while you've been injured you got this new it's not what it's like a virtual sort of yeah only thing.	1.0
Yeah invested bit of my birthday money into buying trainer from a bike so I can get my Black up and then ride that indoors and then that connects to my laptop and on the Swift app. And so it's like yeah virtual black ride with other people from around the world. Yep. So makes that more variety of it more interesting.	1.0
But what I thought was classic was your board all that, but then the subscription is running out so you can't use it anymore not paying monthly subscription fee.	0.0
There's like not planning on this being to long term. And yes, it's going to last a month.	1.0
Well, hopefully it's just good timing and now running slowly introduces a little bit more anyway, so yeah not really care.	1.0
Okay in that Netflix subscription is enough for me. Yeah.	1.0
All right, very good good update and I guess we'll chat more say january-february once we're up and rolling again and got a few races. His plan.	1.0

His plan. Yeah, hopefully before under the belt by the end. Yeah. Yeah, beautiful mate. I could show you this morning down. Alright. Alright. See ya. See ya.	1.0
okay, so chapter 16 of Genesis had me kind of laughing because it it reminds me of just how we are as wives sometimes but this chapter is so rich in just how it can relate to today and that's why I love the Bible man because there is like if you you just read through just to get through right to just like check it off your list. Then you are missing you are missing some good stories on you are missing some good lessons. And and so let's dig in. Okay chapter 16 is the birth of Ishmael Ishmael. You know what I'm just gonna apologize beforehand for how I pronounce some of these names, but basically it's the birth of Who comes from sarai's servant? So Abram who later is named Abraham and Sarai who's later named Sarah. So Abram and Sarai have been told by God in earlier chapters. Well Abram has been told that he's going to be a father of a bunch of Nations. Right but they are very old and Sarai decides to take matters into Her own hands because she is so old and wants to have a baby that she gives hag are her servant to Abram. Now when I first read this or like when I've heard about this in the past, I was always like how scandalous like that was. Okay, you know because it doesn't really condemn them in the Bible. It's not like God comes down and it's like how dare you sleep with another woman when you're married Abram, right? Like but here's the thing like it's not right. It's not right. It God does not say that that is okay. But Sarai gives her servant to her husband, which was not uncommon back in that day and It was actually a common practice of that day. If a married woman could not have children. She would have like a substitute wife. So one of her servants have a child with their husband to produce heirs in Abram and Sarai we know had wealth right livestock and land and all of that. So and I believe it's in a previous chapter of Genesis that Abrams like I have no errors like my servants gonna inherit it or my servants kid. You know, whatever. So let's that's like an overview right but this is so rich in lessons. Let's get into it. So Genesis 16 starts with now Sarai Abrams wife had not been able to Bear children for him. But she had an Egyptian servant named Hagar. So sir. I said to Abram the Lord has prevented me from having children go and sleep with my servant perhaps I can have children through her and Abram agreed with surprise proposal. So Sarai Abrams wife. Took Hagar the Egyptian servant and gave her to Abram as a wife. This happened Ten Years After Abram had set settled in the land of Canaan. So we all know what happened right Abram had sexual relations with Hagar and she became pregnant, but when hag are knew she was pregnant she began to treat her mistress Sarai with contempt. So let's back up though really quick to Abram going and sleeping with Hagar. Abram was acting in line with the custom of the day. Right? So it was common for that to happen. But his action showed a lack of faith that God would fulfill his promise. So what are something this is like the question that I asked myself what are some things that are acceptable today by the world, right? What are some things that are in line with the custom of today?	1.0
that	1.0
Is exposing my weak Faith or my unfaithfulness or my Disobedience to God like what are some worldly customs of today that we kind of like in the Bible?	0.0
It's not right or it it shows our lack of faith.	0.0
It's Disobedience, but we justify it by saying Well, everybody's doing it we justify it by saying well, you know like Like I mean the the common practice of today like it's okay nowadays, right? That's why it's so important to filter like how we think and the things we say and what we do Through the Bible.	0.0
So I want you to ask yourself that what are some customs of today.	1.0
What are some things that are acceptable today by the world that is So beating it to God or that's exposing like are weak faith in God, right? Because sir, I in chapter 16 verse 3 sir. I took matters into her own hands by giving hag are to her husband Abraham, right her weak faith in God. She said God has prevented me from having children. She had trouble believing God's promise like Abraham in chapter 12, right, which says let's go back to chapter 12. God said God. I mean God told him that are I'm sorry. No in chapter 12 when he goes to Egypt and is like look you are a very beautiful woman. He says this to Sarai when the Egyptian see you they will say this is his wife. Let's kill him. And we can have her so please tell them you are my sister. Then they will spare my life in treat me well because of their interest in you. So here's the thing Abraham's lack of faith that God would protect him. He took matters into his own hands write and tell Sarah to act as his sister and it creates all these problems while they're in Egypt same thing with Sarah when she took matters into her own hands because she had trouble believing God's promise out of this lack of Faith came a series of problems now. I want you to think of our your life or I'm thinking of my life right now how this happens when we take over for God right trying to make his promises come true through efforts that are not in line with his specific directions. Sometimes God gives us a promise. Sometimes we hear God calling us like, okay like	1.0
Cheers Cheers this big promise I have for your life. Right and we're like, oh my gosh, like how am I supposed to do that? Sometimes?	1.0
I know that I have tried to handle all the details. But sometimes God is just calling us to be obedient in just taking a step of Faith out. Right and we most of the time we don't understand how God's plan or his. Promise is going to work out but we need only to be obedient to what he's calling us to like that first step right not having to have it all figured out anxiety stress overwhelm. This all comes like in our life. I know in my life when I try to take when I try to figure out all the details right like when I try to be in control of everything or Get super impatient while waiting for God. In in in when Waiting for God period right like I know that I can become very impatient. Like if I'm like, okay. Yeah. God is definitely calling me to this like let's make it all happen overnight. All right, like I am so impatient. Oh man, but it says Be Still In know I am God. So this is actually in Proverbs or in Psalms. I'm sorry.	1.0
This is in Psalms chapter 46.	1.0
I believe be still and know I am God, right? We just we just talked about this in church recently and being still is not like idle rest, right? It's not like okay just lay down and do nothing. It's a command that it and it's like a cease of worry, right?	1.0
It to be still is a choice with action not idle rest.	0.0
So in order to find security in God, you need to stop finding Security in everything else right and worrying about everything else will how is this going to happen? How did it end like stop wrestling against God and let him show you who he is right in chapter 15 Abraham and Abraham believed the Lord and the Lord counted him righteous because Of his faith not by his Good Deeds, but by his belief in who God is and and that he would be faith that God would be faithful in his promise right not worrying about the details of when just acting in obedience and being faithful to God when we ask God for something and have to wait we can be tempted to take matters into our own hands and then it interferes with God's plans. Right? Like I know for sure and I call this like a detour Because I opened a studio when I knew I rushed into it. God was not calling me to that at all II like instantly had anxiety. I was stressed like in those things do not come from the Lord right? But this was early in my faith when I did man when I was just striving for achievements and I thought I had to earn God's love. I thought I had to like like accomplish things in order to earn his Van earned his blessings, right? I took matters into my own hands all the time all the time. I wasn't allowing myself to be still it because I really didn't truly know who God was because I wasn't in in deep relationship with him because I was trying to be in control of everything.	1.0
so chapter 16 verse 5.	1.0
Okay. Let's get back. Let's get back to this. It says sir. I said to Abe. Okay. So let's so Abram had sexual relations with Hagar. This is a verse for so Abram had sexual relations with Hagar and she became pregnant but when a hag are knew she was pregnant she began to treat her mistress Sarai with contempt, right? So she was shoot. I'm sure hag are was like, oh I was able to have a baby and you're not ha ha ha right then sir. I said to Abram this is all your fault. I My servant into your arms, but now that she's pregnant. She treats me with contempt the Lord will show who's wronged you or me. Oh my gosh. Okay. So this is typical like for me. This is typical me and my husband right? I'm going to tell you the story and I really don't like to admit this but um this ornament from my son who's 10 years old now, I have this ornament that I treasure with	1.0
Like all of my heart because it is his hand print from when he was like 2010.	1.0
So he was like a year and a half old. She was born into June 2009. Okay, it's this handprint and there's like Little Snowmen and oh my gosh, it's a glass ornament is my favorite ornament because it can't be replaced. Right? So I like I double box it when I put it away and I store it and when I take it out, I put it high up on the tree. So none of my other kids can touch it. Like I love this ornament it if it breaks All Is Lost right? So I finally took down the tree after New Year, but I first took all the ornaments off because I really just wanted to get the tree like out so I took the ornaments off I put him in a little pile. I took the tree down. I like swept and stuff and all of a sudden it was like boom. My Deegan was awake. My two-year-old like things got crazy. My husband came home. Home at the same time and I had to go take a meal to a friend because she had just had a baby that was in the hospital. All right, whatever. So I'm like, oh my gosh, babe. I have to go take this meal. And so while you're watching football, can you just like start putting away those ornaments boom? I was out right? I should have put away and I the first thing I thought to was like you should probably put that ornament away ever, but I was like nah, that's fine. Right dumb because my two-year-old and a four-year-old were up. Round I should have known I should have known and I was like the Lord told me you need to put that ornament away, right? But I didn't so I came home and Lord.	1.0
What do I see when I first walk in the door Aubrey's like looking at the floor and I'm like what happened and I see glass shattered and I'm like, oh my gosh, that's my ornament and sure enough.	1.0
It was Riley's ornament from when he was a year. Year and a half with his handprint. I don't have anything else with his handprint on it from that time and it is is broken and I'm like, oh my gosh, and of course, I turned to my husband and I'm like, why did you not put these ornaments? Hopefully, I like totally blanked him right for these ornaments and he's like if like really like you should have put you should have put it away. Like if it was that important to you, right and oh my God, let me tell you girl like I'm a Christian. But I like the south side of the Kingdom came out at me. I got so upset and I got a little hood on him.	1.0
Right?	1.0
I hadn't realized my husband looked at me and he was like, oh man. I have not seen this side of you in quite a while right could anyway, so here's the thing though, right? It is often easier to strike out in frustration and accuse someone else than to admit. MIT an error and ask for forgiveness like in this is kind of what sir, I did to write like she arranged for Abram to take hag are and and was like give me a baby in the husband's like well, okay, like like whatever you want, right? Um, but then she's angry about it.	0.0
And even though Abram also should have stopped and said something right? Like like sir, I should have taken should have admitted to the air and asked for forgiveness.	0.0
But man we've been playing the blame game since the beginning right Adam and Eve they both eat the forbidden fruit and God asked Adam about it. And he's like, well this woman you gave me told me to eat it, right and then he's like, well this serpent told me to eat it, right I mean It is so much easier to blame other people or to play victim really right and knew that victim word is like dang know like none of us want to admit it. But we do and that is just us as humans, right? That's why we have to go to God and a girl. Let me tell you when I was like, I mean I got upset at my husband, but also the Holy Spirit told me like Eva.	0.0
This is not like this is something you need to give to me, right? I needed to ask my husband to forgive me for for how I was acting it was my fault. I could have put the ornament away whatever there was no reason to be angry and it actually put a wedge in the night for my husband.	0.0
And I you know, here's the thing about anger to is. Anger, especially when it arises from one of our own mistakes. It can be dangerous. Right because hag are was so sir. I was so mean took it out on she was angry with Abram, but she took it out on hag are and cause hag are to run away.	0.0
And so these three people that we see here in this in Genesis right?	1.0
Three people who made serious mistakes sir. I who took matters into her own hands and gave her servant to Abram Abram who went along with the plan but when circumstances began to go wrong, he refused to help solve the problem, right? Because I believe he says he says well, she's your servant like deal with her as You want you know and then you have Hagar who ran away from the problem, but in spite of this messy situation that all three of these people get themselves in God demonstrates his ability to work in all things for good right Romans 8:28. That is that that is like one of my favorite. I think that's a lot of people's favorite verse.	0.0
Let's see. I don't want to I don't want to miss it. Miss say it because it's so good. Romans 8:28 I'm flipping there now. So if you want you can flip their to or not. Just listen and we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them. And so we know definitely that God had a purpose for Abraham Abraham whose Abram at this point answer I write that all that the nation. Be blessed through them and so regardless or despite the fact that Sarai and Abram took things into their own hands because they were impatient on God's promise on God's time. He still made it work for his good for the purpose of of his plan right for his purpose of Abram and Sarai. So sir, Ian Abrams still received the sun.	0.0
They so desperately wanted and God solved Hagar's problem. Despite Abrams refusal to get involved.	0.0
Right? No problem is too complicated for God if you're willing to let him help. But that's it's so hard to admit our wrongs especially when were angry or were sitting waiting for a promise from God and we're just were anxious or feeling overwhelmed. I mean, I know I get so antsy in the waiting period but that's when we start to take take things into our own hands.	0.0
We miss those opportunities to grow in Relationship with God to grow in our faith, right?	1.0
I think we ask God for so many things that sound like good ideas, but then we have the opportunity to practice those things. A lot of us are like, oh heck no like not right now next time right? I know that when I was really upset with my husband with that ornament. I was like Lord I do not Lord, I do not want to admit my wrong my pride right?	0.0
Oh man, there it is like my pride and I even my word for 2020 is available available to serve available to love available to be kind available to do whatever God's calling me to write and I knew that it was that I was being a brat that I was taking my anger out on my husband and I was blaming him when really I just needed to	0.0
Suck it up and admit and I made a bad choice.	0.0
Right and I need to and I'm going to suffer the consequences of my of my bad choice, but instead it is it's so much easier to vent our frustrations in our anger and try to place it on somebody else. So at the end of the night, I went upstairs and I looked at my husband and I was like I don't even think I said anything we both started laughing and I was like, you know, I'm Kat I've been asking the Lord to soften my heart about this to forgive me. I was like, it's so hard. You know what I told him. I was like, I really don't want to be nice to you right now. And that's when we started laughing because I knew that it was even though I could not replace this or an imminent, right?	0.0
The Lord was telling me you are still blessed with these three kids like it is it's an ornament. It's a thing you have your children. You have your husband like it.	1.0
It'll it's okay, right, but I still learned a lesson in that now if I would have instead in been in raged right in let that take over. And I wasn't willing to just sit with myself because I literally sat down stairs. I washed the dishes.	1.0
I put some praise and worship music on and I just sat myself I was singing and I was just spending time in God's presence for giving my husband and my heart truly truly and just being honest with myself and honest with God and you know, I just maybe there's some	1.0
he has or maybe there is something that has happened that you need to let go and forgive. I I don't know.	1.0
I don't know but I hope that you're able to take some time to be honest with yourself. Be patient with how God is working in your life. And remember that if you allow God to work in your life he can he has the ability. To work in all things for good for those who love him. Right. Allow God to work in your life. Give him the space to work in your life. My prayer is that. we can all be honest with ourself surrender these frustrations surrender our control give it all to God and that he will encourage us to step in obedience even in the smallest things. I hope you guys enjoyed this as much as I am. I'll talk to you guys soon. Peace out.	1.0
