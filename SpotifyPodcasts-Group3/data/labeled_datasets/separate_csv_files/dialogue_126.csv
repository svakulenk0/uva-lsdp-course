Let's dump it all out in this interview these guys a true legend joining us on the phone. A shark attack Survivor a motivational speaker military diver and author of no time for fear. How a shark attack Survivor beat the odds joining us on behalf of indigo industry scuba equipment and listen when I say a military diver, I mean a member of the royal Australian army paratroopers and he's past as well as the Royal Australian Navy. As a clearance diver, ladies and gentlemen, Paul De gelder so what an introduction thank you. Yes. Well, I think you deserve it. I think you deserve it. Obviously your national hero. First of all, let me get this out of the way thoughts and prayers are out to everyone in Australia right now. I'm sure you have friends and family there. So our thoughts and prayers are with them. That's a horrible horrible thing. Are you in touch with people back home right now?	1.0
1	I assume yeah, absolutely in the thick of it. Get down on the south coast about eight hours south of Sydney. She's in a safe little pocket though. She says she keeps affirming to us because we're all telling her to get the hell out of there. But I've got made some friends that have lost everything all the wildlife that's gone. And obviously, you know, I'm a big animal Advocate and conservationist. So it's really heartbreaking but you know, the way that the world has come together to support my home and my country And the people in the animals, there is just mind-blowing and I don't think anyone can understand how grateful we are as a nation for that support.	-1.0
2	Well, that's that's good news to hear and it's great news to hear that everybody physically is okay and it's just a horrible horrible thing. Take care of the planet people. So why we're saying take care of the planet only when I give describe your military career basically for us it seems to me that you basically	1.0
1	Lee were the Australian version of a Navy SEAL for us it's accurate it's similar, but it's not exactly the same there are elements that we do the same job as crossovers but the Navy SEAL do a lot more soldiering than we do, you know, the clearance divers aren't generally getting chop it into war zones to go and assassinate terrorists and things like that. So we do attack swimming and mine clearance and reconnaissance with And even reconnaissance on land underwater explosive Ordnance disposal as well as land-based bomb disposal as well. So there is a lot of crossovers but it's not exactly the same.	-1.0
2	Okay, so you basically you are what the the seals were before they became the seals underwater demolition divers what they were yeah, very cool.	1.0
1	Yeah. Okay now closer to the traditional problem.	1.0
2	Yes, absolutely.	1.0
1	Well, but with way better tools technology has come a long way. Like what just to the diving equipment itself? Yeah, pure oxygen rebreathers, the mixed-gas non-magnetic rebreathers that we use to dive on mines under water so that the magnetically charged Minds won't activate when they detect us all of the equipment, you know, diamond-tipped massive chain saws that can cut through concrete the broco underwater putting guns that can burn through basically anything on Earth under water. All of the safety equipment for the power shooting in the Foss driving out of helicopters and just it's you know, it's a big boys toy club. We get to play with millions of dollars worth of Cool Tech and then blow stuff up. It's a win-win that's incredible.	1.0
2	So with all right, so I was a diver for the State Police in Indiana back in the day. There's a long time ago. I Technologies change. We are equipment with so crude. I can't imagine what it's like for divers now, especially	-1.0
1	Elite divers like the team you're on like how long can you be under water at any given time before you would have to come up for air many hours how many hours because that's a beauty of the real because it recirculates your own from your body has a carbon dioxide absorb in inside it that absorbs that CO2 and then you basically just keep rebreathing and the little tanks of gas whether they be oxygen or nitrogen. Helium for deep diving they just squirt a little bit of extra air in so the little tanks last way longer so we could we would do a tax swims in the middle of the night for anywhere up to three hours.	1.0
2	That's amazing this what is it? What's the deepest you've ever gone underwater 90 meters.	1.0
1	So that's tongs by three about 280 feet.	1.0
2	That's a long way.	1.0
1	Yeah, that's a long time to get there and it's been longer to get back.	1.0
2	Yeah, so I don't remember Were the formulas or any of that stuff? I was I think I went a hundred and thirty feet was the deepest ever did and at that level you went twice that it felt. So weird like everything compressed. I remember I had to keep tightening my weight belt because everything shrinks from the pressure. Yeah you deeper and you get knocked.	1.0
1	Yes and coming out to knock out Isis. It's like being really really drunk.	1.0
2	Yes. Yeah. Yes exactly felt like really being drunk. So are you going to come up? So like I forget Is it 15 meters and you get a stop for like 15 minutes or something like that?	1.0
1	No did not get the bends it really depends on how long you've been under and how deep he's gone. And the gas you breathing on it can all change depending on if you're breathing on oxygen or nitrogen or helium. The different depths. You have to stop at the different periods of time. You have to stop at and I remember the first time that I did it will do her in still in training and we were doing Bounce dive, so just basically down and up on a helmet to about 60 meters about a hundred eighty feet through sixes open. Yeah hundred eighty eight and my we always dive with bodies when possible because it's a dangerous business and it's nice to have someone there to back you up, but my body couldn't clear his is and so I had to go down by myself. And this is just outside the heads of Sydney Harbour and this is a great white shark highway is tiger sharks as bullshit. And so I have to sit at my what we call a wet. Stop a decompression stop at about 15 meters for 10 minutes. And I feel like the smallest most indefensible worm on a hook. I've who's so exposed in the middle of the ocean.	-1.0
2	Just dangling on a rope waiting for a shark to come out of the murk speaking of sharks for those people don't know I mentioned it briefly which is a huge like understatement was passed by so quickly. Glee shark attack Survivor people need to know that you you lost an arm and you lost a leg. You lost a hand Okay Hand.	1.0
1	Yeah. I love my hand and said the shock took my right hand and all of my right hand string in one bot and I ended up losing the rest of the lightest. Oh, I'm now above knee amputee and in Deputy what how did this?	1.0
2	Occur, where were you what happened?	0.0
1	We were in Sydney Harbour. This is 2009 in February, which is the end of Summer from Australia. So it's usually the hottest period of the year, but it was it was early morning. It was still pretty chilly and we were doing some testing of new equipment for the R&D Department of the military just unmanned video and sonar that wood was attempting to track and detect us. As we were swimming through the water and was right alongside the Navy base in Sydney Harbor place called woolloomooloo. And this is a place where we dive in work all the time. We've been there for decades. No one's ever been attacked. There hasn't been an attack in Sydney Harbour in 60 years. So it's pretty safe as far as all things go, but I was terrified of sharks. Also.	1.0
2	I'm like one of my worst by the way, that's a phobia. I also share. Yeah. I've never been close to a shark Whatever by Justice Zoom in when I get in the ocean, I'm just always terrified.	-1.0
1	Yeah, and we will you know is the police divers. Well, most of our diving is done water where you can barely even see your hand in front of your face.	-1.0
2	That's the only diving I've ever done just muddy. Yeah, it's Rivers is I've never had the pleasure of being in the ocean. I assume it's awesome except for sharks. So go ahead about yeah.	1.0
1	Yeah, you get pumped by stop and you just say, oh that was just a log or something. It's Rick yourself inside. I've had my knee. A guy in the water first for the first 30 minutes he a swimming up and back up and back and it's equipment trying to detect him and I decided to do him a good turn and I said just jump out mate. Let me take over take a break and I jump in the water in a black wetsuit a pair of black fins, and I'm on the surface on my back. Just moving from point A to point B, and I look over my left shoulder to make sure that I'm still headed towards the bow of the warship that I'm supposed to be attacking and before I can turn back I You have a huge whack in my leg and it didn't really hurt but it just kind of shocked me and I turned around to look and there's just a massive shock head touching me and takes me feels like seconds to work out what's going on because I've never even seen a shock and all of a sudden is this, you know, it's like Shark Week has come to life in front of me while I'm swimming and I don't really know what to do. And I think the shark knows what to do either because it's kind of staring at me and we try to work. You out if I'm food, and then so my survival instincts kick in and I think all right. I've seen the crocodile hunter. I've seen Shark Week over our job it in the eyeball. So I tried but I can't move my arm and I looked down and I can see the teeth embedded into my wrist and every time I try and pull it I can see the flesh tearing I was so I think nothing left hand I go to the eyeball with my left and I reach over but I can't reach it and in short side grab it by the nose and try to push it off, but that Is the type of the lower jaw deeper into the back of my leg. So I cut back to try and punch it in the nose and by that stage the Sharks decided on food and starts to shake me and that's when the paint kicks in like a hundred teeth razor-sharp teeth on either side of your limb moving in unison to tear through your flash and all of the fight went out of them took me under water and I was just yelling and I was in agony and we popped up and I took it. Breath and then it took me back under and just kept thrashing me around like a rag doll and I realized how powerful it was nothing I could do and so I realized that I was going to die and I remember thinking to myself. I'm not going home today. I'm going to die right now and it was strange because it wasn't like times flow down. I think our bodies and our minds are such incredible machines and my mind went into hyperdrive and I started running. My life is hanging. Okay, am I ready to die and I thought well shit no coming from where I started out as a really lost and bad kids self-harming and drugs and all that stuff and fighting and stealing to where I had achieved Peace Keeping with the UN and the elite of the Navy and all that sort of stuff and I thought you know what I'll come further than I've ever thought possible if I'm going to die now I have no regrets. I'm ready to go. And so I let go and I was ready to drift away and the A shark at that point ripped through the rest of my leg and took my hand off and because it wasn't attached to me anymore. My wet suit made me boy and I'll pop to the surface and I realized that I wasn't dead and I thought shit. I got to get out of here before it comes back and I saw my safety boat with my three teammates in and I start to swim to the safety boat. But as soon as I take a stroke, I can see my hands gone. It just my arm ends at the end of my wetsuit and my medical training kicks in and I think I've got to keep that wound above my heart to stem the bleeding. So I've got one out of the water swim back to the boat with one hand and one leg because I can't even feel my right leg. I don't know what's wrong with it at this point. I just can't feel it. And the guys in the safety boat said I was literally swimming through a pool of my own blood and they said when they came in closer, he was actually so stick they could taste it in the air and I just I didn't think I was going to make it. I thought there's so much blood in the water sharks will come back and other sharks going to smell it and I'm going to die. I'm just waiting for a shock to grab me. By the other leg and it just never came so I just kept swimming back to the boat and eventually the guys got to me pulled me out of the water and just out of the sheer relief of not being eaten any more. I relax my eyes rolled back in my head and I pass out and my mate almost brings into action and his training tells him. I'm going into cardiac arrest and he needs to stimulate my heart. So he straddles me and he starts pummeling me in the chest. I'm trying to wake me back up and and it work. And I wake up and I look over and my hands gone freshly bitten off by a shark and I look up and tell me who's beating the shit out of me and I just think today sucks.	-1.0
2	So did they not hear or see the attack that you had to swim back to the boat?	-1.0
1	They couldn't come to you they were coming towards me at the same time. They were pretty far away though.	-1.0
2	Yeah. Okay, so I assume by this by the way, you described initially seen your And in your leg in Jeopardy at the same time was this shark big enough that it's bite like trapped your right arm against your leg. So your hand and your the back of your leg were in its mouth at the same time.	1.0
1	Yeah. Absolutely. That's what I'm trying to show that measured The Bite in my wet suit and my leg said that it was between two point seven three meters. So so about 9 foot 9 or 10 foot long. So it was it was Much bigger than I was just sure sheer power.	1.0
2	I mean usually you'd be helpful in its environment. I mean I've seen pictures of you you are a physical specimen and you felt completely powerless. I mean, that's one hell of a show.	-1.0
1	You can watch it. It's on YouTube.	1.0
2	I'm going to watch it.	1.0
1	I'm going to watch it was it was part of the exercise. The unmanned video on Sonar was recordings. So I was trying it and it recorded the attack, you know, it's not great quality. Yeah, but you can see it.	1.0
2	So there was an underwater camera that captured this whole thing was on the surface on the surface. Okay, man.	1.0
1	Yeah, you see the thrashing see couple of black things. I mean you see me swimming away. What type of shark was they said it was a bull shark by the type of bite but you know, some people have said they think it was a great white because it came up from underneath me. And also there was a great white attack the next day at Bondi were a surfer lost his hand.	1.0
2	So This you're underwater for that long. And basically you're fighting for your life. And at some point you just kind of have to come to terms with it and peacefully accept that this is the end like that that's a long time. I assume it seemed like forever. However long it really took but is like can you even describe was it like almost like an out-of-body experience? Like when you finally accept death, you're like I'm here was there it was there any kind of weird?	1.0
1	Associated with that outside of these really like that, you know, not a lot out of body or anything like that, but this is monologue going on in your home. Yeah. It was just I have absolutely no fear of death anymore because I know that death isn't scary, you know, being a parent and being attacked by a shark yet terrifying really but death itself and going on to whatever is next. It's actually quite peaceful and the First thing that I think now is well, the only reason that was was because I had no regrets and I had nothing no thoughts of I should have done this or I should made up with this person. So now it's like, okay. So all I've got to do for next time I die is make sure I feel that exact same way. So now I get to really really live because there is no fear of death. There's no having to hold on to the Mortal coil. I get to be anyone I want to do anything. I want I'm happy and all I have to do is just have no regrets and they loving to everyone and help where I can and now I just really changed the whole direction of my life and my mindset so you're saying is the key to happiness is to just almost died and then live it.	1.0

We actually had this conversation on our last episode. All right, someone like you who is now missing their hand and ultimately you lost one of your legs from the injury, which is harder to go.	1.0
1	Without good leaves the leg the leg is heavily this never lose a hand.	-1.0
2	Okay, so that you're saying it's worse to have lost the hand in the like absolutely 100. That was our guest.	-1.0
1	You can rip you can replace a leg Yeah leg is it's great, but you can replace it. There's not that many moving Parts. You need a knee and ankle and while they're not, you know, it's not replicatable to Perfection like You're like a human leg. They're pretty damn good now but a hand they have not worked out how to do that because you have multiple moving joints that move instinctually you can feel where they are. There's sorry complicated and the robot hands don't even come close. My robot hand is amazing. It's the best in the world. It's about $90,000, but it's a $90,000 beer can holder.	-1.0
2	Thanks so much for answering that cuz I was sweating a little bit to ask you that I thought was this is this disrespectful but really I mean in this day and age you see, you know amputees without a leg they come back from combat or whatever and then the technology is so good. You almost don't even notice a gate in their walk and they can run competing all these things. But yeah, it makes so much sense. There's so much more going on with the hand. It's going to take a lot longer for that technology to get to the same. Level Paul, do you still dive a lot? And if you do, what was it like At first time going back in the water?	1.0
1	So I do time. The first time was amazing. It was three months to the day after the shark attack and I just had two stitches and Staples out of my leg. And all I wanted to do was get back in the water and two of my mates came over and they took me down to Bondi with a couple of surfboards and I was really paranoid about it because As a really populated beach in so I felt embarrassed and self-conscious and I've got my eight foot board under my arm and the paparazzi were there taking photos and so it was pretty hard to deal with but I'm hoping down through the soft sand and I get to the water and I can maneuver my way to about waist deep and I put my board down and the only thing I was worried about was I just whispered to myself. Please don't let me paddle around in a circle. I didn't I nearly drowned smashed by every single way. But eventually I got out the back and I was in the song sitting on my board with my mates and it felt so freaking good and you know, I try to remind myself that a lot when the running blade actually hurts a lot when I run I don't enjoy running that much anymore. But I remember how good I felt after I made that huge effort to get down to the beach to Get out into the waves, you know, it's not always about the struggle of doing something. It's about the happiness at the end and knowing and they're just living and that that it motivates me to get up off my ass a lot of the time when the alarms going off at 5:00 and I'm like, I don't want to go to the gym. It's cold out and but I know that feeling will come as soon as I'm out there doing it and living and so I always give myself a bit of a mental uppercut and Y'all started live. I've never ever regretted that but I've definitely regretted not doing things.	1.0
2	But now the recovery how long did it take before you got back to feeling like doing these things? I assume that was a long process.	1.0
1	I went back to work full-time after six months. Wow. Are you serious? Yeah. So one of my greatest be the will the greatest be wasn't about Losing the leg in the hand. It was about losing my career because it's called it was it was everything to me. I loved it and I fought so hard to achieve that and I was terrified of losing it and so instead of letting that fear crippled me. I used it as a motivator and I let it push me into die with you know, just two days after my legs chopped off. I'm trying to do one-handed pull-ups on the bar above my bed so that I can start training and then I went home and I had one of my best friends who Really was a savior. He quit his job up north moved in with me and act as a carer and cooked for me and clean for me and drove me around. I really couldn't have done it without him. You can't undervalue the just the smallest amount of support in these situations. And so I was in the gym at the army base every single day training learning to use my body again working with the prosthetic companies to try and develop weightlifting Prosthetics. And so yeah over a year and a half to have three More surgery to remove bone spurs and that was always very hard progressing and then going in for surgery and going back to square one again. So that was pretty emotionally draining and having to get back on the drugs again, and I was self-administering Oxycontin and own which is the fast-acting oxy Gabapentin, which is a nerve blocker antidepressants for the nerve pain sleeping tablets. And so I could smash as much of that in my head as I wanted, but I kind I knew what it was like to live in a cloud. Cloud from when I was a teenager and I was smoking heaps a weed and was working in Hospitality doing other party drugs and I swore to myself. I wouldn't go back to that person. And so I got off the drugs as fast as I could got back to work and just started trying to prove myself that I deserve to be there.	1.0
2	I assume you created the light of that mental toughness and fortitude from your military career. I mean you were special forces guy there in Australia, not technically not special.	1.0
1	It's a department of the Navy.	1.0
2	Okay. Okay. Now what year did you leave military service?	1.0
1	So I joined the Airborne unit November 2000 transferred over to the Navy April 2005 and left full-time. Service August 2012.	1.0
2	Okay, and when did you first come to the states?	0.0
1	The first time was actually on request by the US Navy they're having a diving conference and they asked me to come out and speak out it in San Diego. And so that share that was like two thousand and two thousand twelve or 13, I think and that was my first trip in San Diego beautiful. Yeah. It's all right absolutely fell in love with that town.	1.0
2	So what did you think about the state's what? How did how did you think about the diving practices compared to what you guys Is dead is it all the same or very similar?	1.0
1	It's all very similar. But the difference is you guys have Specialists. Sorry, there's a department specifically working or H sort of thing that we do so you have salvaged and repair unit that works with the tools and uses the helmets. Then you have an underwater bomb disposal unit. Then you have the Tactical operations team. Then you have the land-based EOD whereas we don't have as much as many people as you and so the current starters we have to do all of that. So it's an interesting but it's hard to remember a lot of stuff. So it was really cool to just come out and meet with everyone and I made lifelong friends from that trip. Any one of those guys is my best friend to this day and the water spins the opposite way, correct? Yeah, exactly. You know, I kind of fell in love with it and America has this really romantic sort of feel for Australians because we all grow up watching. It on TV and in the movies, and and so when I got the opportunity to come out here all a jumped on it and I love living out this see that's how we feel about our show you is that we have very romanticized absolutely.	1.0
2	So tell me about what you have going on. Now you some advocacy work and tell me about what's going on with Indigo Industries scuba equipment because you are one of the best divers to ever do it and I assume that's why you work for them. What kind of cool shit are you doing with them?	1.0
1	I'm sorry. I got a contract with Discovery Channel to host Shark Week a couple of years ago. So I've been hosting shows on Shark Week. How good does that feel?	1.0
2	How good did that feel to be able to host Shark Week the coolest show we have of all time dude.	1.0
1	It is mind-blowing. Yes. I can't even believe I get to do this I get paid to go and do things that I would pay to do and then I get a little home movie out of it and everyone gets to watch it around the world. Yes. Absolutely, amazing eyesight. They pay for me to do incredible things that people don't get to do I swim with great white sharks without a cage where she does that although it is kind of like every year makes me wonder how Discovery Channel's going to try and kill me this year and last year. I did a survival show with a British Special Forces Guy where we parachuted from 15,000 feet directly into the Pacific Ocean for 44 hours with no food. No water surrounded by sharks was the fairgrounds or else? No, not the Bear Grylls last night. It was a guy called James glancing who was a royal Marine 44 hours at the ocean. Yeah. That was it's a long time. These aren't you can understand how hard it is when you're bouncing around the ocean. You're tired. You're hungry you're thirsty and trying to cut. Hole in the butt of your wet suit while you're moving around too. So you can poop student suit. You can't sleep in the suit get a rash. Yeah, I thought that was the second one the E before they blew up our boat off the coast of the Bahamas and we drifted through the ocean again through the Atlantic surrounded by Oceanic whitetip sharks, which are the sharks blame for the biggest shark attack in history the at the sinking of the USS Indianapolis. So there was Reportedly 300 American Sailors were eat by these sharks. So it was kind of you know, I wasn't just a survival thing was a message about shark conservation and what to do if you're stranded and you lose your boat, but also telling the story of these Sailors, so it was a really great thing to be a part of was there any part of you?	1.0
2	Also was there any part of you when you're getting these requests we like hey guys already did the shark thing like I lived I don't be running more sharks.	1.0
1	Okay at this point. Gone, like if I'm genuinely fearful for my life while I'm waiting the treatment of the show. I'm pretty much sure I'm going to do it. Yeah, so I know there's another one we did last year where we are on the back of the boat, and we wanted to test this Blood myth where you know, sharks can smell a drop of blood in 10,000 legs of ocean. And so we went to the Bahamas and there was 25 feet of water with tiger sharks bull sharks hammerhead sharks nurse sharks everywhere and we drained half a liter of My Blood Out It into a bag and I jumped off the back of the boat and swam away and then ripped open the bag. I was surrounded by this huge plume of my blood just to see what would happen in hindsight that doesn't seem very clever. It was kind of fun.	1.0
2	They did it what was going to happen?	0.0
1	Yeah, they do nothing absolutely nothing so they can't smoke that in Nightmare not attracted to our blood at all. I've seen sharks ate poop. But I haven't seen him that you know, they just done the guys threw a bucket of fish pond off the back of the boat after that and I had to swim through that and that absolutely changed their demeanor that went total predatory and I had to stop calling him off.	1.0
2	So they're gonna be all over me.	1.0
1	I saw this guy with one leg and one doing things that normal people can't do all want to be and they're just It sparked that interest that made them want to create some adaptive diving here. And these guys have been making equipment for the Special Forces all around the world for a long time. It really could have they make such incredible new Ingenuity equipment that you know, it's just really great to use. I love it that just designed me a set of my own sins. We started this line called The Bionic AF, you know what that means? So the probably got a bionic a offline with short travel easy carbon fiber sins that are super super light and I like them short because I can't maneuver as well anymore with my diving leg my robotic diving leg because it doesn't really Bend at the knee whenever I want it to like you would if you're spinning with your normal leg. And so having these really long freediving sins and bulky scuba Sims makes it harder. So that made these really short wide powerful carbon fiber. Thins that I just amazing and then travel bags you can put all your stuff in a really awesome day say that's perfect for traveling really light really easy to use for me with one hand. So it's just cutting it back to the Simplicity of making diving not so complicated so we can just enjoy it.	1.0
2	That's incredible man. I tell you why I am we get we get a list of guests sent once or twice a week and we get to go through them and decide who we want on our we don't and I'm so glad we said yes to you. I mean you you are just a badass you're a badass with that different kind of mindset and I'm thankful that you you made it through everything you did and not only that the like you're a champion now for others who are a PT's and you're doing some good shit out there man. So I wanted everybody to know that they need to get a hold of your book. No time for fear. How a shark attack Survivor beat the odds. I'm assuming it's available everywhere books are can be found Amazon and everywhere else and your website. Is that Paul De gelder.com?	1.0
1	Yeah. Yeah, that's it. And that basically has a link to my speaking that I do. So now I'm out here. I'm traveling around America. I'm off to Kansas City Missouri for my first trip next Wednesday to go and speak at a big conference. I've done Amazon Snapchat. Viacom Microsoft like all the big companies and I just love it. I really really enjoyed getting out speaking to these companies and these businesses and people and just sharing all of the things I've learned about life and all of these cool stories and just lighting a fire up that everyone's asses so that they start to live again because people go through shit, you know what it's like you don't know what the person next to you is going through. We all have these Amazing Stories and struggles and sometimes we just need that. That fire lit up under ass again. And so that's what I love to do aside from chocolate.	1.0
2	I want to run through a wall right now. Absolutely. I need to go here you watch you speak some point. You're not a guy that needs a bunch. But can I give you some anyway made white cut out. I said, you don't necessarily a guy that needs advice. But can I give you some anyway, oh, absolutely.	1.0
1	I'm always open to advice.	1.0
2	You're going to Kansas City, Missouri. So you're going to get a lot of recommendations for barbecue you	1.0
1	Need to go to a diner on one of those guys and there's a reason for it. It's because I went to Africa to shoot a documentary and I was working with a really brilliant guy called dynein Manda and he found he's an Australian Navy clearance diver. Also who founded the International anti-poaching Foundation and he started the first all-female run from the anti-poaching Rangers to the managers to the staff to the H all female run from Broken backgrounds abandoned by their tribes and Villages domestic abuse women and he's down in them together to fight poaching in Africa and I was there filming with him and he didn't eat me and that just blew my mind. I'm like why the hell would you like one big and I'm like what the hell is happening? I don't think me and I said why you know, I grew up. I love meat. I eat ate all the kangaroos in the world and he said we'll look I was out here trying to protect the animals and then I go home and I'd eat the animals and I felt like a hypocrite and that kind of run of bell with me and I thought well shit, I'm doing that with the oceans and I'm eating animals and I hate hypocrites, you know in the military were trained to lead by example to do as I do not as I say and so I always drive to be that sort of person so I can't justifiably go out into the world and say hey you need to protect sharks and look after our oceans and look after our environment if I'm going home and I'm contributing to the destruction and so very very slowly and I'm talking very slowly. I started canceling out different things and expanding my repertoire of vegetables and Grains and all that sort of stuff and I've been plant-based for nearly four years now and I love it. I'll never go back why I thought feel healthy strong. I didn't lose any muscles, you know, I didn't grow boobs for meeting so food, and I haven't had a single injury training in four years. So I'm Happy I'm strong. But at least I've got vegan barbecue. I'm screwed.	1.0
2	Well, it's they might I don't know go check out Kansas city jails. Anyway, they do have beer if you like beer tastes like very gamey.	1.0
1	It's a lot like I guess venison dish. It's very very rich flavor. I mean, I really liked it. I used to like it when I can chili con. Kangaroo kangaroo tacos spaghetti bowl over created with it. But yeah, not anymore because those Kangaroos dead.	1.0
2	Yeah, we got the way and it makes sense. It's commendable what you're doing and it makes sense to your vegan except for I would I would have thought you would at least allow yourself shark. Like if I were you I would just see every start every shark. I could get home.	1.0
1	I never really blind the shock. It wasn't it's just that she's doing stuff.	-1.0
2	Absolutely. Well, thanks again for coming on and you're a badass military veteran. Thank you for your service, even though I've never lived.
