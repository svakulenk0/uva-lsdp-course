1	There are some actors that you feel like you personally know because they play roles that remind you of folks in your family and your neighborhood or people you went to school with. So in 1999 the movie The Wood came out and it really is one of the most underrated movies because what made that movie special. Is while it was based in Inglewood those characters could have been coming of age and Detroit Chicago really anywhere now Omar Epps my guest today on Jamel Hills and I'm bothered has been in a few movies that are just like that from Jews to Love & Basketball, even the program he has had an incredible career that has spanned some years. He joins me today to discuss not just his career, but the book he wrote about black fatherhood his days as a former MC in case y'all didn't know he used to spend on the mic and Why we've never seen him and Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin in the same room now, but all jokes aside. Very pleased to welcome Omar Epps. He's up next. Because I'm such a gracious host especially to guess whose work. I've admired for a while and you know people who I get the sense even though Omar you and I don't know each other that well, but you know, I fuck with you, right? So because of that, of course, I'm gonna open with something that I'm sure you have a lot of thoughts and opinions that plays right to your strength. Let's talk about your damn Cowboys. Ha ha ha. Wow. I know what a what an opener. Yeah, like real Graces of me to like bring up something. I'm sure right now for Cowboys versus everybody is a sore subject. So where do you stand on Jason Garrett? Because a lot of is to some degree typical after a loss that people immediately direct all their anger and frustration at the coach. So that's kind of common but with Jason Garrett is just has always felt as if there's been this love-hate relationship between him and Cowboys fans who are expecting more you always expect more but in particular this year, so what's your assessment of?	1.0
2	Jason Garrett, it sucks. I'm 50/50. I've always been 5050 with Garrett because you know, I'm a big believer like, you know team sort of take on the attitude of their head coaches, right and and you just has that sort of feeling Jason Garrett now don't he's one of the nicest human beings.	1.0
1	So if you had a chance to meet a minimum, he's just a nice guy, you know what I mean?	1.0
2	And so there's a part of you that roots for a person like that, but the sports fan in me, you know, I've been saying this for five years. I want Bill Cowher To be our coach with the pieces that we have if Bill Cowher was a head coach I would it would be over the moon. Okay, but we're going to see it's 50/50. Look it's you know how this change his day-to-day if we end up making a run in the playoffs if we end up in the NFC Championship all of a sudden a Garrison draws forgotten.	1.0
1	You know what I mean? Yeah All Is Forgiven us.	1.0
2	We don't make the playoffs this year.	-1.0
1	You gotta go, you know, what would be a perfect scenario especially for you is if the Steelers fire Mike Tomlin and then he coaches the Cowboys so then everybody can see you guys in the same place, right and no dispel the room and dispel the rumor that you're literally the same person.	1.0
2	I'm sure when people started saying that I mean, do you actually see the resemblance or you just like nah, at first I didn't and I'm like, I guess when I grow my beard out I was like, okay we look he can look like my older brother's wife Lisa. I was like, what do you think? She was like a little bit, right? Okay, so you can you can take it they say we all have a doppelganger somewhere in the universe.	1.0
1	We will know that I guess if there's ever a movie made about my childhood you probably going to be the first guy I would assume so that they call so Alicante is just to do everything. Let's go back to Brooklyn for a bit. You know, as you mentioned you all the New York teams. They were not very good. So, you know, you kind of wound up gravitating toward the Cowboys. In terms of you catching the acting bug.	-1.0
2	How did that come about that came about so my grandfather got arrested. So he was a jazz musician. My grandmother was like a jazz singer like photographer just artsy and you know growing up. I thought I was going to play football and I got hit real hard and I was like, huh? Maybe I can act like a football. But yeah, you know, I've always been into the Arts. I've been writing for as long as I can remember. Are you should dabble with music and the first, you know doing the school play like anybody else and that's when I got bit you did I did we did the play grease? Oh, oh, okay, but then you know, I was I kind of got it really acting became an extension of writing because I've been writing poetry and short stories and all that stuff and you know, when it came time to go to school. I was like, I'm going to audition a performing arts high school and really see what it is, and I hadn't really done. I hadn't done. Any acting classes and you know other than regular public school stuff and I auditioned for vocal and acting and I got in and then that was it after that because this you know, so it's an incredible performing arts school. I mean in the country and just the faculty and just the way that they treat the art itself and the crafted just really I felt like I had found my purpose I'm gonna guess that you probably didn't Maybe	1.0
1	A whole lot of people pursuing that kind of career pursuing that kind of passion. So, you know, what did like your people your friends? What did they think about the fact that you wanted to pursue something? That's kind of non-traditional even though you're in New York.	1.0
2	You know, it's funny about that is nobody really knew I really didn't I mean my mom knew but it was just my peers in school. Like I still have my boys on the Block and he's just like, you know go to performing arts and I was just quiet with my wall and then you know, I had my boy Boys that I grew up with that we went we all went to the same High School my boy mom and my boy Mitch so we shared that thing and and I mean it for me it happened pretty quickly. Exactly. Yeah. I got out of high school a book juice and that's when he was like, oh like you really like trying to do his acting thing and I was like, yeah, but um, you know, I've been I've been blessed ever since. So how did you book juice juice was what they call a cattle call. So I so I you know, Got out of school and I was one of those and take a year off get a job kind of figure out, you know, I didn't I didn't know if I want to go straight to college one of my boys went to how and I was just like I'm gonna kick it around in the city audition heard about this audition went and it was like, I don't know how it seemed like it was like a thousand people there go in read they called me back read again. It was like every call back. It was a smaller group and it was a lot of chi don't remember how many callbacks but I wouldn't be surprised if he was something like 15 called like something out there and then there was like there was like eight of us that they were kind of like trying to put will you to read this role and you read that role and then they had a dinner and I remember my manager at the time she was like, you know, they really hot on this guy 2-pack 2-pack shocker and I was like what you just like whatever you do try to sit next to that guy because they really love love that. And of course as it would play out we sat on opposite ends of the table, you know what I mean, but after we had this dinner and everybody just vibed out and about couple days later. I got a call from Ernest Dickerson. He said hey man got some good news. Looks like you got the part and I was like really and was like it. I'll never forget that moment for the rest of my life.	1.0
1	Now. They they had you you just said that they had you kind of doing other roles to like like, you know, And everyone everyone everyone was there. Did you always want you or was that another part that you were also kind of drawn to his will that you would have been happy to play?	1.0
2	That's a good that's a good question. I think well originally I went in for Q. So that's you know, I had the blinders on for that but once they started moving us around and well you try this role. You try right hand. You try Bishop, you know, you just had to be open to the process, but I think internally, I've always felt connected to Q, you know the first time ever	1.0
1	Script, so well, it wasn't, you know relatively recently. I had bochum Woodbine. Okay who was on the set of juice playing the stand-in for Treach? I think that's what he did. He told a pretty funny story about his first the first time him and pot bonded was they smoke weed together? Alright, so the blood together you remember your first time like when you met him and when what was that experience like first time I met Park was at that.	1.0
2	At dinner, I just spoke about and who he was. No, I mean vaguely, you know, like the Digital Underground thing, but it was it was more vague. You know, we've I blew it was cool. Yeah that you know, he had that pack had that thing that some people have like when they walk into a room there's a magnetic energy that he just, you know, sort of sucks the air out of the room and then after you know, We all found out we got it and I think he was staying at Harlem at the time but his mom's and then they started bringing us in like the rehearsal process and that sort of thing. That's when we started getting cool and but Park was Park which is a one of one-of-a-kind do really really smart way more book reading people give him credit for and then you know, once we started the filming process man, we just Got tight and got cool and it was it was all New York. So, you know cats was trailers was getting ran up in and robbed and it was all type of stuff happening around the filming process because it was still old New York and no I remember going uptown with him to you know, go to his mom's crib and met her and he was a good dude, and he was told he was recording his first album at the time so I have fond memories of like in between Takes all the you know lunch break. He'd be like yo o run up being I'm run up in the trailer and he would be spitting around to me and I'm like, oh, what's that fool? And he was like, oh, I'm gonna do this song blase blase bar, and I've told her story once before but I remember with this is when I really sort of Genius apart one day we came to set and he was reading the papers and some woman had through her baby in the incinerator, right? That's a horrible thing, but sadly grown up in New York at that time. That was normal to hear like you heard stuff like that all the time and park was so affected by like it was messing with him the whole day and I'm like, oh it was like whatever and same thing happened at lunch. Call me in the trail. Yo, he starts spitting this verse and I'm not putting two and two together now months later when the first album come out and I saw Brenda's Got a Baby. I was like, oh shit, that's the joint that and it but I saw the whole process and I was like, oh, yeah, he did.	1.0
1	Mmm different when you guys are shooting juice of course, which went on to become a cult classic essentially. Did you have the vibe? Then didn't have the feel that this was going to be the kind of movie that would like really resonate with people, you know.	-1.0
2	All right, so is is for me it's a 50/50 thing 50/50 in that, you know, I was 17 so I didn't know shit about nothing. Right and it's that's naive Tay that you have that when you're that young that I think protects you from the realities of the entertainment business now personally, I always thought we was making fire because of what the movie was. I was like yo, this is like our life, you know what I mean? Like I could relate so much to the film that I felt like I would go see this, you know, but then you know, this is me saying it in hindsight, but you just there's so many variables that come into you know, the filmmaking process the timing the market Yada, yada yada, but personally I always felt it was going to be fired. You know what I mean? Because I was a part of the process again. I'm on set with pot we doing this scene. We doing that scene and storylines going here going there. I thought it was dope.	1.0
1	Do you think juice could be remade today?	0.0
2	It could I think I'm going to believe in like you leave the classics alone. I think you could take like the bits and pieces of the story line and modernize it. You know, I don't know if you continue it.	-1.0
1	I was like you can't Guys, like literally everybody's day. Yeah everybody that were the characters like they're all going.	-1.0
2	Well you do like you do like, you know Q went on to become like a record executive and Bishop had a baby. No one knew about that. They found and he raps now, so he's signing up him here.	1.0
1	I don't know. They always come up with something creative. As you said like not only you know, you were enacting you always into the Arts. And music was something that you were also into now. Was that something at that time? You were pursuing at the same time?	1.0
2	Yeah. I had a record deal before I booked my first movie A lot of people don't know that and so it was me and my cousin we had a group called wolf pack and we were trying to get after it. But that was the gatekeeper days. That was when you couldn't I mean it didn't you know right now you can just hit send and this out to the world and it is what it is and you know, they wanted I was kind of an Ali and his sense of now there's just hit movie out and we got this kid signing with deal but he's spitting up because we was more awesome like revolutionary kind of Dead Prez type of field and it was like nah, we we need the radio and I'm like, well, that's not me. So it's just got bottleneck that that you know at that at that point and I was young too. I was young little bit cocky. I guess you could say because I've this things I look back on like I remember sitting in cash. Now's office and he heard the demo we had he was like Ayo, I'll put you in the studio with primo and y'all do for joints and my dumbass goes now my man need to do the beach.	-1.0
1	Just so people can understand what he just said. Is he turned down working with DJ Premier? That is who Primo is okay for his man's who is man's baby.	-1.0
2	Come on, man, but I'm loyal do okay. I'm a loyal dudes. I was like yo at the time we was rocking with my man doing the tracks this of course Primo's a legend now. I look back on this kick myself in the ass all the time. But at the time, you know, I was just being loyal.	-1.0
1	My peoples yeah, but you know, I was surprised to see your man is if he was for real he to be like you know, what I appreciate the Loyalty but you enjoy.	1.0
2	Yeah, exactly.	1.0
1	I wish you told me that too now because we do our research here now, you know, we do have a clip of you rapping, right? All right, it's what you want a wolf pack. We're gonna play your verse right now. Remember that verse and you remember that whole yeah, I remember that time.	1.0
2	Yeah, that was a that was a crazy. I was a crazy night because it was a battle. We battle like for duels at night. I think I was like, I think I got caught out there that night. I won one and I got cold out there for the other but this is all while he was filming a video.	1.0
1	Oh, so you made the decision to not pursue, you know music not in the same way that you pursued, you know acting but how many times have you kind of rethought that decision? Not that you couldn't be an actor too, but you you literally could have done both, you know what I mean, you know.	-1.0
2	It was a different time again. Like when we look at how it is. Now, everything is so fluid and you know, but before everything was so rigid like this. Is he even back then it was like whoa. If you do television, you'll never be a film star. If you know, if you do film you can't go to tell like people looked at television like it was beneath the people still looked at, you know, you can go on to be a Broadway Legend and like with the music The Duality thing was was kind of rare back then I mean even when you go back before my time is You know, very make Barbra Streisand, you know what I mean? And Frank Sinatra was never really considered an actor. They were just taking advantage of situations, but you didn't certainly from the black side of things. You can see that Duality like that. So, you know, I never really everything happens for a reason and I know I put my all into it so I don't have any regrets in that way. Like I never feel like oh if I would have took this seriously like not took it seriously. I got I got thousands of songs in the stash. So, you know just Just it just wasn't meant for me to do it at that time.	-1.0
1	I guess so out the gate you do juice and you did do some TV stuff in between but movie. Why's your first three out the gate is juice the program and Higher Learning you did Major League to so that's a to yes. That's sure that's that's your for still out the gate. That's a pretty crazy start. What was that time like for you then it was surreal.	1.0
2	It was surreal. So, you know soju. Comes out and you know, it's just like, you know poison Hood came out. It was just like we felt like it was this new movement. You know hip-hop is everything is happening at the same time like you go back to that time frame. You can't just look back at my career. You gotta look it with hip-hop is that you got look at everything to inform you of how it felt to me because it was just like we just felt like we were at the tip of something, you know crazy happening right now. And if and for the culture this overuse were now but that's what this was like the the second birth of the culture and then, you know book this movie to program which for me was, you know again, I thought I was gonna play football. So now I'm getting to live out this kind of thing and the writer director of that film David Ward, he wrote major league and so while we were filming the program he was like, you know, I guess there's something contractually was happening with Wesley Snipes who played in the original Because I didn't really want to do majorly to that wasn't my cup of tea. But again that loyalty thing I'm like yo this dude gave me my second job site. Let's go rock. So when rock with that and then Higher Learning, I think John Singleton originally wanted to POC to play Malik, but then pop got locked up. And so then the, you know getting higher learning it was it was a glorious time. It was a great time. It was like, you know the to taste your dreams and to get to live them out is invaluable, you know, and You know, you know you making a little bit of money and you know, you just for me it was like surreal I was so young when this whole process by the time that I'm not even 21 by the time you know, Higher Learning is coming out. So it's just like boom boom. Boom.	1.0
1	You know, how much did you have to adapt to that to now all of a sudden you're famous, you know, right.	1.0
2	So I was totally disconnected from being a household name because there was no social media, so I didn't know that you didn't know you were famous now, I know. I was famous like in New York, you know what I mean and you know certain places if I went to do promotion and it was it was a different world. So we didn't have that that instant connectivity. So I didn't know how famous if you want to you know, say like that and plus the type of person that I am. I'm more like laid back I had to depart to feign that I really had to you know, I'm from Brooklyn like it wasn't do staring at what they looking at and we got a whole different mindset and they might just want to autograph and it's like oh	-1.0
1	Even you not from gentrify Brooklyn or from like from the pre gentrification Brooklyn, right?	-1.0
2	Yeah, so so me and my crew we we Street about it. So we had to make that adjustment but there was also a lot of love back then and I'm talking about within at least like the New York entertainment Community, you know a lot of cash where you you know, you run into Wu-Tang over here you running the Mobb Deep over here and it was a lot of love like everybody was very supportive of one another. You know what I mean? Because we were Everybody was like we all riding this wave and like where is it going? You know everybody's young everybody's ambitious. You know, you had the Godfather Russell Simmons blazing the trail, you know, you got young puff coming up about to tear it up with bad boy, you know Andre Harrell like it's you know, I just have great memories and you knows a lot of great parties, you know, but, you know when it came to the other stuff it was real it was real it was it was it was Tough times in terms of you know, New York wasn't London and I'm saying that because London has the most cameras in any city in the world. Now New York is like London. This wasn't that New York, you know what I mean? So when you come out the club and you go around the corner to get into it the Wolves is on you so you kind of had to kick up dust so people who they knew who not to you know rock with it in that way, but you know that ain't nothing but a little adjustment.	1.0
1	So you just said that like Tupac was initially tabbed as Malik. So how did you slide in and get that?	1.0
2	I don't know. I don't know. I just got the call because I don't know Edition for Higher Learning. I think I got the call. I spoke with John and got the role.	-1.0
1	What was it like working with him?	0.0
2	John Singleton, John is He was he was super intense. Good good dude fun, you know, but he was really meticulous. That's the one thing. I remember about John like everything had a purpose every single thing on the set. The way the setting was everything had a purpose for him because he was into the he was like a genius Storyteller. So it wasn't just the words coming out of your mouth is what you have on is what's the picture on the wall? wall behind you when you're saying this line and and it was um, it was an intense set and it's really interesting how that was another set where we you can you can this certain projects with it feels bigger than the parts like we're saying something profound here this thing and you could feel that permeating through this set, you know Cube doing his thing and and Jennifer Connelly doing her three Kristy Swanson, but You never know like you look back on high alert and now and it's like sighs like prophetic, you know, you can't really know that in the moment, but I just think you know, that's a testament to his storytelling and you know, he picked he was talking about Universal things and and Timeless things that are unique to the American Experience.	1.0
1	You know what I'm saying most times when you when you read a script. Do you know if the movie is going to be good at you?	1.0
2	An idea like some scripts you read you just like this is incredible other scripts you read like hmm, you know, I could see it working. If and then some scripture read. I mean most scripts. I read them like this terrible, you know, I mean you spend most of your time saying no, but you know, you just try to get to those the mid-range ones because the reality is some scripts you read and it's like the concept is there it's not quite executed on paper, but If you get these four actors together, you ain't got to worry about it because they're gonna go boom and do their thing.	1.0
1	So, you know, what you worried at all after you know, Jewish. I don't even know if they said because you were so young. If this evening entered your mind said that were you concerned that you might get Typecast because as you mentioned if you think about juice in the context of everything else being made at that point, I mean, this is 1992, right? So you got boys in the hood you got mrs. Society, so discussing black trauma and putting black trauma on That way was a big thing. It became a cottage industry where you ever concerned that this is this is who are all of who Hollywood is just going to see you as no, I was never concerned about that because probably to your point because I was too young too, but I was never concerned about it.	1.0
2	But because I know my abilities and at the end of the day, you know in this business the opportunities that come your way or one thing, but the power that you have is the choices that you make so You can say no, you know what I mean. They were plenty of those 90s films that came my way that I was like, yeah. No, I'm good. All right, you know what I'm saying? And at the same time in the midst of that I did, you know a film for HBO called Daybreak. I did a film called deadly Voyage face, but you know what? I mean, I was throwing these curve balls out there. So you couldn't Typecast me.	-1.0
1	You know, I mean it even higher learning kind of was right, right because you're a college student and athlete again, you know, I mean Not a football player, but a track star so bright that also is showing a different look. So what's the I feel like every actor has a story when asked this question. So what's the role that Got Away the one you either turn down or you maybe you misjudge and like yeah, I don't either the only role they got away from me was in Dead Presidents.	-1.0
2	Lorenz is well and that it didn't supposed to be that no, no, okay. Just beat me out for the role. I went up for the role. They went up for the role and I was like what happened at that joint. It was I already filming it with who learn and I love the rain. So I was like I will you know, he got the better of me that but that's the one when I saw the movie. I was like Tim. She's like yo, he did his thing he did his thing in the movies.	-1.0
1	So there was never one that that you put in the reject pile. That wound up being not something that you would have. Okay. So know your instincts have been pretty good on this cookout.	1.0
2	Yeah, even when this films that I've been in and out when I'm like but this is how I pay the bills so I gotta do this one.	1.0
1	So you have you have shot in your mind like a bad movie before absolutely.	-1.0
2	Well, what movie was it - why I want no say it. That was another one. I didn't want to do it, but I'll let the team at the time he was Like really big on the international disrespect to the right of the Rector, but they were like, he's gonna be the next hot thing and Bubba Bubba and I just knew. Like I was of the generation that they were trying to sell that movie too, and I'm like we don't care about the story line like we don't relate to this whole Mod Squad thing the child put we don't but you know the opportunity to work with Giovanni Ribisi and Claire Danes on the face of it.	-1.0
1	It kind of seems like a good idea. You know what I mean to some degree. This is back then so just before rebooting everything, right?	1.0
2	So it was so destroyed. It was just like link like we don't like like Three like I don't care about link like I don't you skipped a generation. But yeah, that's one joint where I was just and I have a good feeling about you.	-1.0
1	Like I like the head I went back it was her pressure on you because you have been in Black centered movies mean you are that's where you kind of started to build your reputation. How much pressure or was there any pressure at all for you to do something more quote-unquote mainstream?	-1.0
2	No, I wouldn't say it was any pressure because again, you you have to work with the opportunities that come your way I think for me a little further down where in my career and not to fast forward that far but I think that's why house was such a significant move because at that point I was like yo, I got to do something to break out of this mold or if you want to call it that I just knew I had to do something that they do not see coming and nobody saw that coming you CER that way not really, okay only because I was only 14 So and I knew it wasn't you know, it was gonna have that lasting thing. It was a cool little pop up. But I mean it was a cool little pop. It was a biggest show on television, but because I wasn't like entrenched in fashion. It it really didn't hit me that way, you know, but that for me that I was making that move to do house was a great move.	1.0
1	All right. Well a few moments ago, as you said it was his New York come up all happening at the same time. You mentioned puffy because at that that time bad boy was was blowing up and one of the groups that blows up you have a personal connection to so when we come back from the break we are going to talk about you and the lovely mrs. ABS one member of the group Total certainly one of my favorites growing up. So we're going to talk about her and I'm gonna put you on the spot about a couple things. All right, so don't get too worried. Well get a little bit worried but more with me how you started out co-ed. So you like watch what a hook but more with Omar Epps when we come back. You know, it's not a lot of people I think to these like in these times especially like writing is such an underrated ability and the fact that you've been writing, you know, your whole life is really incredible considering, you know, again, it's just not an ability. I think that a lot of people have is one that's underrated so much so that you follow this path of writing that you wrote a book right from Father list of fatherhood.	1.0
2	How did that come about that came about when my son was two something happened one night when I came home from work that made me question whether growing up without a father had crept into my father Hood, which is something I never thought about, you know, because I have two other kids, you know, two daughters and so that you know, I was kicking around the idea. That year. I think I kind of rolled out some chapters and I just didn't get to it, you know, and then like a few years ago. I just like I just really need to get this out. So I started writing to explore this question. Like I did Growing Up Without a father creep into my fatherhood and you know halfway through I felt like maybe my story could be a Thule inspiration to others that have similar backgrounds. The things that nature or maybe I don't know maybe it can help. So I you know, I finished finished the book. I decided to self-publish it which is crazy not the recommended thing. But um, you know, and I put it out there and I think you know, it's really getting it was a great run to have those conversations amongst men and women but specifically amongst men within our community about fatherhood and and the responsibilities of the mail, you know, and I black families and it I actually was inspired because a lot of solid father's out there's a lot of young Brothers is you know, they they don't have all the money in the world. They might not have the highest education but then the kids lives and they're trying to make it happen.	-1.0
1	So yeah, one of the statistics that's out there because it seems like Like we whenever there's a discussion about fatherlessness or the father not being in the home. It just makes his way into our community right when the research shows that more than any other racial group. It turns out that black fathers are more involved in terms of you know, childcare reading to their kids like activities like black flower fathers are ranked essentially number one and you know, we know that obviously being you know, The the product of out of wedlock, you know marriage or whatever or I don't like situation. That doesn't mean your father isn't around right and so people sometimes conflate those two. Now you mentioned it was like something that happened. What was the incident that kind of sparked all is well.	1.0
2	So so I work like a 16-hour day. I came home. I was tired. I just wanted to you know throwing CNN and have a glass of wine go to sleep. And my wife was like Hey, you know, he's still up my son is still up and he was two years old and I was like I'll get to and she kept nagging me about it, and I thought to myself. At least I'm here, you know and then that thought kept echoing in my head because it of course I love my kids, you know, but I was just like damn where did that come from? You know, what does that mean? Like because obviously I like I love my kids more to love myself, but that's that's what kind of got me on that Journey but it's interesting what you say like with these statistics of now because and I touch on this in my book like when I was growing up, You are eyeball if you knew your father like I only knew two dudes who knew any fathers and we used to look at them like y'all weirdos. Yeah, you know and that's how much we had. We had rationalize that trauma and and I think that's a generational thing too. I think you know when you go back, I mean, we're not gonna go too far back, but let's just say from like Vietnam era right you go back then you got a lot of cats coming back home. They on drugs a lot of cats are going to jail and heroines hitting in then the 80s come around. You know for us it's like my mom always says like my generation is like yo, we did the Civil Rights thing y'all go get the bag. You know what I mean? It's like every generation has another thing so you have a lot of you know, a lot of us people my age would whether you college educated or not, you know the out there not just with jobs, but with some form of a career, you know, and they come from not having that think so. Everyone is like we're trying to reverse that cycle or break the cycle, you know what I mean?	-1.0
1	So As a as you mentioned are the father of three what for you is the biggest challenge kind of in fatherhood.	-1.0
2	I think it so I have a 20 year old 15 year old and 11 year old now the you know, I think any parent, you know the for the first thing you want your kids to be safe, right, you know, then you want them to feel loved and then you want them to learn right and to learn to teach themselves. And what I found is that like Parenthood is just like life. It happens in phase. It's like I've never been the father of a 20 year olds. This is a whole new part of the ride so I can you know what? I mean? It's like my daughters like ya next year for my birthday. We gonna have a drink and I'm like, wow, okay, she's gonna be turning 21 wide, right? And so I kind of and I'm and I'm I tell my kids that like, sometimes they come to me with certain things. I'm like, I don't know. I'm trying to figure this out like you are you know, but I think that's the challenge is to one of the other challenges is to sort. of unlearn generational You know patterns that you know that we just do is families or as black families or you know, so like for my kids never beat my kids, you know, I don't want them to get whip now for me. I needed to get whoops. Oh, I'm not mad at my mom's right I get it. But you know as a parent I was just I specially because my first to wil girls I never wanted him to have a memory of a man putting a hand on them and that starts with me now to challenge it at is but it becomes psychological warfare because when they messing up, you know there You need to have some lines of authority. So they learn you know, the rules in life, but then it's like okay, how do you because you certain instinctual feelings you have you know, so it's challenging its challenges constantly challenging that it you know, with the oldest. Like I said, it's like it's a whole new ballgame of Connection and all right, how do you because I can't just snatch you up and throw you in the back. You know, you got your own apartment your own car. So this is all right. How do we wait this out that yeah, but I'm still your father.	-1.0
1	You know I'm saying right now was that more challenging to stick to that, you know not wanting to physically discipline your kids. Was that more challenging with a boy.	-1.0
2	Oh man. That was way more challenging because he's my son. I'm just uh, Now you need to discipline them. And now I tell them now I'm like, yeah, you you the reason why I stay in the gym because when you get 16, I give you that body shot.	-1.0
1	It will have all been worth it because you know one time I mean it is it is I guess a rite of passage that I'm sure you know, you've learned in talking to other guys probably your age at some point like it seems like boys want to challenge their father. Yeah, you know, they think they can whoop y'all. I don't know what that is girls only. We go through that necessarily that we may get real smart mouth and other and like I said psychologically right like to mess with our parents and especially our mothers because I don't know if you've been through the phase yet. I know your oldest is from a previous relationship but been through that phase of like seeing, you know, your wife and your daughter. It's like go at it like world domination is at stake.	-1.0
2	I see that okay this year, especially because like my baby girl, she's just like a different type of personality and we Have an interest in connection because it's like she's I just um, she just like me in a sense of out sometimes my wife gets frustrated and I'm like I go over I say three things and she's like, oh, okay and it works and she says I'm just like, I don't know we got this thing, you know that it works. But with yeah, my son is definitely because he's a mama's boy. And so it's a he's a great kid, but it really is challenging because you want as a man as I look at it. It's like, you know when you discipline your kids like the Appling you're going to receive outside of these walls of our house has no love attached to it. It's just cold. It's just you know what? I mean? So the discipline you receive with us. It's coming from a loving place. There's a lesson to be taught here as a lesson for you to learn and I think like as a man you like, you know, you want your son to be tough. You want to this she wanted to be that but I think you have to meet each child where they're at. They're all three different personalities, you know, and and that's another part of the challenge. Because you just want to sort of lay down this one law that doesn't work for you, you know, and that's you know, when you when you juggle in three different personalities or have them in multiple kids that definitely can be challenging.	-1.0
1	So in the book you discuss the fact that you were 12, I think when you met your father and you guys only spent four days together, what do you remember about those four days?	-1.0
2	Well met my father one time The One and Only Time and we hung out and how did that come about I ended up finding out that my mom tracked him down like he was in Brooklyn the whole time and I guess you know when I was 12, I wasn't a bad kid at all. But you know, you get to that that that point that you're talking about with the boy is like testing the waters already.	-1.0
1	I feel yourself a little bit, right?	1.0
2	Yeah. So Mom Dukes was like I got to find your father and you know, and and she tracked him down and You know, I'd look it's spitting image of this guy. So so for me, it was a it was a it was weird because it was like looking at a it was like being around a stranger who looks just like you and and at the time my sister was six weeks old. So he's he had just had her and you know went to his house where he was staying with his girlfriend at the time, so I went over there. The next day went over there and hung out and it was just I remember was just like a odd feeling because you know, I had built up had so much resentment and anger at that point, even though I was only 12, but I was I guess I opened myself like I let me see what this is about and then you know, two three days later. That was it. You know, he just went back into the Shadows.	-1.0
1	Where are you? Even though he like he said it was awkward, but were you expecting more? Did you did you have the expectation in your mind that a relationship a full-blown would relationship was coming as a result of that short time you spent together, you know, it's funny.	-1.0
2	I didn't know what to expect. I think you know because originally like when my mom was telling me I was hesitant, you know, I was you know, I don't need to meet him and you know, she was just like no just meet your father and I should you know, and and when I think about it now and my mother and I have never Discussed this but when I think about it now, you know, some of that was probably for her as well like yo, I had this kid together married for a couple of years like you ain't been in his life and which would make sense to me. I get it like at least see him once you know, but for me, I really didn't have any expectation, you know, and It you know, it's a it's a weird thing, you know, but for me, I took all of those emotions and I turned them into fuel a really transformed all of those. I guess you could call them negative feelings and I transformed it into fuel, you know, and and and I also use that you know, I felt like I'm the man of the house. I gotta protect you. I gotta protect my mother. I'm gonna make sure she good, you know, and I took it and ran.	1.0
1	Yeah. Allotted to deal with that with that age, right?	1.0
2	I mean that's a pretty heavy burden it is but you know, when that's again when this is all you're seeing, you know, and then I go back into my own family and I see the patterns of fatherlessness and if that's all you know it and that's what's normal, you know, so this is what all my friends felt, you know what I mean? It's set for the to now the two who knew their fathers. Love them. You know what I mean? Love them. They I got a lot of juice for them and I learned through their Actions, you know on how to parent like you said earlier actively like they was always around one of my boys is you know, you had four boys they let me times like you need a new you 16 need a car. I'm here. He was still cool with their moms at if it's something broke at their house. He would come through fix, you know, if they had barbecues he was still around, you know, and my other friend is his parents were still married. So, you know that that but his father wasn't was another one that was like, you know, I was like I ain't Because you just you get to see the living blueprint, you know of black father who specifically when you when your dad passed.	1.0
1	How did that make you feel? I mean any other than just obviously somebody you know dying that your that's your father. But how did it make you feel given the lack of relationship that was there?	-1.0
2	You know, what's interesting is like I didn't feel I felt sad for him because so let me take you through the so so that happened at 12:00 right when I'm 21 reconnected with my father and that's when I came into my sister's life. Then that dissipated now. I mean I've been in my sister's life ever since then but I'm saying him and I was relationship. I'm 25. I try to do it again doesn't work. Then when I was about to turn 30 at a long conversation with one of my aunts that inspired me to try to rekindle that didn't work and so through my life up to you know, when he passed away. I had tried to open this door, but through that experience. I learned that you know Every relationship has to be a dialogue and can't be a monologue. And for some reason when certain, you know, we would talk about certain things and when certain things would come about he would certain Poise a conversation will come about he would just close off he would just close off and so, you know, I told them, you know, I told them I forgave him. I told him, you know, it's all love and you know, I gave him those things and you know, I would tell him I'm saying, you know, they must be if we're both still here God must have a purpose for us to build something, you know, so so when he passed, you know, and I'm saying this just to be honest with you and I'd say this with no I'm not trying to be it was like hearing that someone passed, you know outside like when I leave here, you know, it was like a stranger because I didn't know and For me, I just felt more sad for him because it didn't have to be that way, you know, and he had other kids. He had one other son who he was in and out of his life. So but I was the first one I was the oldest and there was a point that like I did so let me tell you this other part like with my sister. I I got to a point where I was like I was willing to have been the guinea pig like I get it I was your first kid is all new to you volleyball. But when I saw that he repeated that pattern with my sister, that's when I lost a bit of respect. I come on like I would have much rather. That's when I had expectation. I thought at that point he would have been like yeah, I figured it out. Okay, you know also given but when he repeated that same pattern with her That's you know, that was a disappointment.	-1.0
1	Did he ever give you an explanation why he was wired that way to be just in and out of his kid's life or specifically in and out of your life.	-1.0
2	No, he never gave me a straight forward answer was just like, you know things happen or you know that and I even when I would question him about his own family like, you know, your siblings and this and how did because his family was from, Norfolk, Virginia? My will how did you end up in New York and how even when I'm you know, if I talk to my mom about like she can only go to a certain point because you know, she didn't know his family or she knew he had the one cousin over here. But you know, there's just so many just gray areas of, you know, we don't have the information and you know in some of our conversations. I've really tried to open that door like share your story. Like I know you have a story to like, you know, and he like I said, he would just close off he was just	-1.0
1	Clothes on what was that? I know you obviously read a whole book about it. But what was maybe the one pattern that you could recognize that you were even though you're clearly present and your children's life, but maybe what was the one emotional pattern that you could recognize that you were repeating based off what you had kind of learn or didn't learn from not having a relationship with your father.	-1.0
2	I think it's more the latter. I mean for me, you know not having a relationship with my biological father is it? Headed in me very young way before I decided to have kids like I'm never going to be anything remotely close to that. Right and that that will present its own challenge to a person because that's such a low bar. I'm gonna be there.	1.0
1	It's like other your kids right exactly like that Chris Rock joke, I take care of my kids you suppose these phones to really act like they babysitting their own children, but it's you know, when it will you grow without your father like just accomplishing that like,	1.0
2	In there, you kind of look at that as an accomplishment, but you know, you have to be active you keep using that word active in Paris. And that's the truth. Like you can't just send a check or pay bills like you gotta be active because kids remember everything but money they remember time. Yeah. They remember when you weren't there exactly. Yeah. So, you know for me I would say, you know, it was more about out of there was no pattern that continued. I think it was just like I set the It for me was going to be the opposite of what he presented.	-1.0
1	So let's talk about your lovely wife. As I mentioned before one of the group members of total who we was all rocking out to in the 90s. How did you how did you two meet we met Pope at a party? And so you actually met at a puffy party. Yeah, that's makes this even better.	1.0
2	Yeah, we met at a party and it was one of those it was just one of those, you know. Oh, they one of those fairy tale moments. They write about in the movies. Like I'm in the party. She's in there. I see her across the room and the whole room disappeared and let me guess kissing you started playing now. I'm okay, but real talk like the whole room disappeared and I'm just staring at her and got caught her eye. She staring at me and I was kind of you know, shy so we kind of both shuffled and kind of made like a Mid-ground like I'm not going to your sides. You're not going to my side and then I think I just walked past and I just like your eyes are beautiful and she was like, so are yours and then that was it? Okay. I got the number. It's when you had the right down and oh you got a pen. Yep, you know what? I mean got the number and then hit us. I've known her since I was 18.	1.0
1	So, how is how did you guys manage that like you both kind of were blowing up simultaneously. So how did that impact?	1.0
2	The relationship well, was it open about our story is so for the first two years of us knowing each other. We were just friends platonic like we would just I was the homie and then we started dating, you know, we kind of dating but then like after about a few months like six months ironically enough. I was the one that was like we probably shouldn't date. And she was like, wow, I was like yo you about to do your thing. I'm about to do my thing. I really love our friendship and I don't want to do anything to disrupt that and I don't want to like you're supposed to you were young like, you know what I mean? Like, I don't want to resent you. I don't want you to resent me and so we kind of went back to friends and then a few years after that we kind of just Kind of grew apart, you know a little bit I moved out here to LA and and then one night. I'm in the club and I'm going to the bathroom and this girl is like oh, you know my homegirl Keisha and I'm like Keisha's fight me and she was like, yeah. I'm like call her. And she called her and we got on the phone and she can tell Amy left.	1.0
1	Yes. So you guys were able to just like pick up as if almost like no time had elapsed.	1.0
2	Yeah kinda sorta we had picked up because they think like we we laugh about this now but like, you know as they start blowing up and that part when I say, we, you know, we stopped dating and whatever, you know, I've started this is when cell phones is just coming around like it's normal for people who haven't Phone call the number change. So I call them all script like yo her number change. Yeah, she ain't give you the new number his number. I'll call yo. Why don't you be the new number? Oh, I forgot Bubba Bubba that happened like one other time and I was like yo the next time your number change and you don't give me the new number. I ain't calling you no more and the number chanting I and I didn't call her no more and that's how we grow apart. But you know, what's the funny part? One of the funny parts of this story is her homegirl that I just mentioned two weeks before that they would I think they was in Atlanta and she said they would just you know, the girls night Sex in the City whatever and they just got into a random conversation with a homegirl a sir. Who's the one you know, who's the guy that you know you would you feel like got away or that you would marry the drop of a dime and she said me. Is it was okay that it out? So then two weeks later. I'm in a club in a home girls like oh, you know quiche and she called me I was that was the girl is crazy.	1.0
1	Wow. Well story so give her her musical background your musical background. How can we see a collab album?	1.0
2	Well now we've I wrote on their first album, actually I wrote um, she gives me writing credit, but I helped her write a couple joints on the first time, but you know, it's waiting on huh You know how she went headfirst into mommyhood. So we'll see but she's an incredible songwriter.	1.0
1	Yeah, was that something that you know, you guys kind of both wanted or like how did that kind of come about in the sense of it just happened organically because when we reconnected they were in the middle they have another album.	1.0
2	They were recording the third album that was fired by the way, and I don't know the on the business end of things, you know, she was a she was tied with the industry and all that. This is Prior to streaming. This is prior to this new wave of how you know, everything is done. And I don't know we just decided to do us, you know, and I've always been supportive whatever she wants to do like build a studio in the crib like what you know, take it at your own pace, but she was just like no I'm going to do my kids like I don't want to deal the industry, you know, and I think it is difficult. I think for anybody but especially a woman, you know, My once you have a baby and you know what, I mean, like you, you know, haven't her having had hustle so long. She just kind of wanted to take a breather and really be with her kids and not like do both but you know, she still she got some some joints in a stash for sure.	1.0
1	Oh you've been in this business since you were 17, when you look back over your career, which obviously is, you know, still going pretty strongly what it's not I don't mean necessarily. In terms of a movie or a role but like what are you most proud of when you look back on the longevity of your career?	1.0
2	That's a good question for me. I don't know if there's one thing I could point to to say. I'm most proud of I mean, I'm proud of the whole my whole career and and I'm excited about the now and the future, you know, and as my career evolved. I mean, I guess I'm proud that I've pretty much I was able to preserve my Integrity, you know, and you know my for the most part keep my moral compass as a man, you know, and that means something to me, but for me like my career is like pieces of Mosaic like half of it is done. That's the half we talking about another half. It's like it's not there yet because I love it. I love the whole thing. I Fact that I get the opportunity to take care of my family doing what I love to do is supreme blessing.	1.0

And that's great that you've written a book about fatherhood because you know black fatherhood is something that's that's not discussed enough or at least not discussed in the context in which you're discussing it like a lot of times. It's always the conversation is always about what black fathers aren't doing right as opposed to this is how you manage, you know, being a black father and what that means. So you speaking to it from that perspective I think is probably I'm sure Go help somebody hopefully yeah. All right. Well, good luck to you Cowboys. Yes. Okay. Thank you for having me.

1	Well, you live out here. I was like, yeah, I kind of like both. Okay. Alright, you like a loli. But anyway, thank you. Good luck with everything Omar's getting out of here, but I'm still sticking around one more segment to go. Y'all know what's coming people fucking I'm bothered. When I was in high school, my mother told me she had one goal for me to make sure I made it out of high school without getting pregnant. Now. My mother had me when she was 18 years old. So she was coming from a perspective of having truly been there and done that. I like a lot of other young women. I got the usual speech about sex keep your legs closed, but she also put me on birth control pills when I Fifteen or sixteen years old. She taught me how to properly put on a condom. She talked to me very openly about sex point. Is she army with the information she felt like I needed in order to make informed decisions about my own body. Now young people in sex is always going to be a polarizing emotional topic. And so I understand why everybody lost their shit when TI who was one of my first podcast guest said during a podcast interview recently that he went to the gynecologist with his daughter every year. And when she was in high school to quote check her hymen, in other words to ensure she was still a virgin the backlash was immediate Swift severe and intense but T. I also received a lot of support from both men and women for what he said now before diving into the reaction a few things need to be cleared up in the aftermath TI and Tiny who appeared on red table talk, which is hosted by Jada Pinkett Smith and her mother they told their side of the story T. I explained that he was joking. King and embellishing he did not go to the gynecologist with his daughter every year. He explained he did accompany his daughter and Tiny to the gynecologist once and it was mostly happenstance. He said he has never been in the examination room with his daughter and when he was at the gynecologist, she welcomed his presence but here's an excerpt from that conversation on red table talk.	1.0
2	She understands my intentions and she knows who I am. She knows who I've always been right and I think that that it allows a certain level of understand. I mean, it's just the outside the the noise. Yeah is is distracting is confusing and hurtful. It is is hurtful and embarrassing. She was horrified when I definitely understood why she would be, you know feel like, you know was personal to her right?	-1.0
1	Geishas are quiet child.	-1.0
2	She doesn't talk a lot doesn't you know, you know after	-1.0
1	Things out of her right because we as women understand how especially for young girl. Mmm how delicate and what it exposes about her very private, especially to all of our intimate life.	-1.0
2	Yeah. I don't I didn't I didn't get it. I was oblivious to it. However, I am now sensitive to it for her now.	-1.0
1	I wanted to stay out of this because how TI raises his family ate my concern and it ain't my business. However, I am absolutely a here for a larger conversation about how girls and women's bodies are constantly being policed. Now, I will always be bothered by the fact that we are so consumed and fixated on the sexual behavior and the bodies of girls and women and I mean by both men and women case in point how many times have you heard men and some women but mostly men say they don't want a girl because then they have to worry about her getting pregnant or they don't want a girl because they don't want to think about all the boys and men trying to have sex with her and someday it will It their attitude is based off their own personal experience. They knew there was a time when they weren't shit, so they didn't want their own daughter exposed to some Reincarnation of their ancient Indus. So before a girl is even born before she even gets here people already policing her body. Now we have to deal with that our entire lives as women. Not just for my fathers brothers or Uncle's women can be just as guilty I often say this when discussing racism and racial oppression. Ian the real unfairness of dealing with those issues is that the burden and responsibility to solve the problem is placed squarely on the people most victimized by it. So when we have these conversations about rape and sexual assault the conversation is solely centered around women and what we need to do to protect ourselves. There's certainly a place for that but who is having conversations with young boys and men about consent about respect about keeping their hands to themselves if you don't want some asshole boy dish. Affecting your daughter then use that same energy with boys that you have when you want to police girls and women about their bodies instead of telling boys and men and run through as many girls and women as possible. If you want girls and women to be treated better. If you want us to be respected. It's simple raise better men stay on bothered.
