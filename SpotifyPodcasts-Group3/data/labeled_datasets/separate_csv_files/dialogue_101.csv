Cheers time talking to the my queen. Hey, I'm checking on fine. I'm fine could barely a levels. Are we going to be reviewing the games from November? And of course we could actually be talking about a team of the decade as well. But as always, my name is Dave a long. So I've been here is Tom y'all got the black Tom? How's it going?	1.0

1	So, how are you? Of course, you've come I think we felt sorry for you in the last there's always water. Okay. There we go. In the last podcast. We took I'm pretty sure we took the McHale.	0.0
3	Yeah, I didn't mind it was funny.	-1.0
1	It was a shit show that it was I on I ain't joking.	-1.0
3	I generally thought you were really good and then when I put it on foot picture on Twitter, absolutely. Yeah, I'm or Fashions terrible. But when I will stop there in a while it wasn't that bad.	-1.0
1	Maybe it was just it was just horrendous. Yeah, it was right. We are going to be kicking off with well actually the Bratislava game, but the home time Wolves of course ended up winning that game one goal to nil to rely on a stoppage time winner from him and as I mean, it was pure domination, but it was one of those games Thomas. You can remember it werewolves just couldn't seem to break through. Yeah, they go keep ready pretty good games.	-1.0
3	But yeah, you made a good saves and we played quite well throughout the game, but it just took a lot of patience to build to break them down. And then because that horrific injury that took 10 minutes out of the game gave us the extra time to go to get the goal that we needed but ironically	-1.0
1	- Cody as well.	0.0
3	Yeah, but but he put his hands together. So, you know, yeah, it makes it all better specs but I got to be honest.	1.0
1	It's that long ago Dave and I was just my fault.	-1.0
3	It's your podcast me.	0.0
1	Anyway. All right, Matt. Do you remember the game all yeah, it was it was it was really frustrating in I think it was one of those those games that we've seen previously where we did. I think we would have played or not and not scored or just never look like leave. Again, it came in the 92nd 93rd minute. Yeah, 12 minutes and I'm very very very light is the Fantastic header. What a late that was the other similar chance today against Sheffield United worries a lot of standing jump or not jump Center off. It's a great leap. And yeah, it was good obviously very important to get the three points now that now that we've qualified so that's all that really matters isn't it rather than the performance the trailer I put the ball in for?	1.0
3	Yeah, it might ease Souls water wet.	1.0
1	He's awesome. And he's a real ability though. If it is something that he's really showing off a little bit more this year some of the haters and he's got a couple of them this year. We very rarely get what balls into the box I deliver.	1.0
3	Yeah, Troy puts a line any try. All right.	1.0
1	He's already and Border. Yeah, there was of those a point today where we've got two players overlapping on the wing and I looked in the box and there's approximately zero players and their strict him just comes out a lot and yeah, very rarely. Give me exact.	1.0
3	Getting the cross yesterday and we'll move on from that game all unless are you going to have just been really boring but atmosphere and yeah, I read kicked him in the are 12 and it's added on and we got the goal. Drink should have listened enough for that night's an accident. I think it's did it was unlucky to get a yellow card for it. And he said yeah. Hey it's dangerous, but it's all read them. Yeah, like you say their keeper was good. And I thought they just played at their skin, which is a big game for them with coming tomorrow their fans. We have mentioned their fans. They were amazing. Yeah. Yeah, everybody said they were genuinely the best fans. I think I've ever seen him on you.	1.0
1	Please probably about 500 upstairs and downstairs and all these, you know, the reputation of racist chant in and just been Ultras and stuff like that and have come out with these chance and then they followed with yeah.	-1.0
3	I was thinking that needs to be that needs to be introducing. I absolutely loved it.	1.0
1	It was great.	1.0
3	Let's load that stuff into the kind of yeah, I'll obviously thought that was full of kids. They're not mad at the sphere.	0.0
1	I thought that Phantom earlier Tom with a couple weeks go up against Aston Villa 2-1 win. Obviously Reuben Eva's score in the opener him and his more. Let's put in the game to bed before trezeguet got that consolation goal Matt. It was a massive one wasn't it though? That's first off performance. Probably the best I've seen as right ever. Yeah.	1.0
3	It was since the last time we played ever. Hope. That's the that's the maybe man united in the cup holders in there that holds the plastic plastic.	0.0
1	But yeah. Was great. It was doc said probably the best I've seen apply especially especially under Noona if we just take our chances are many times. I need to keep saying and that game would have been out of sight and in the second half we wouldn't have happened. Well, it obviously would have happened but you know, we put ourselves under a lot of pressure in that second half a lot of unneeded pressure. Is that deeper and deeper which have been conscious of in the past few seasons. Anyway, I Watford New Year if I could Braga. Yeah, so it yeah, the first off was great should have put the going to bed, but it's one of those Delivered when it was terrible probably the worst team us. I've seen this either. I'm not just saying that because of the villa and there are local Royal.	-1.0
3	I was really disappointed by John begin because I thought was going to be a property. But yeah, he did turn exactly battle between McKinnon and routine you but yeah, yeah. Well when they show you one just didn't tell the story did it we could have beat him up five one on the day really and five shots on target is Philip. I think Villa did Miss grealish, but they were so bad. I mean they do today. I looked at that I thought yeah, they're getting relegated in. It's the best of sin tree or a human hairs and jata combined. I thought they're absolutely lethal and obviously Doherty and Johnny and they're like we say like you got to be scoring up the score more the chance and yeah, that's it had to a good was there never is his goal. I thought it's been really clever at the time I said because I said to my dad this is going to be s a very respectable to come in this coming out to neighbors and it happened and I was thought I was the best thing ever to put that on there and then people said, let's do it on the radio and they're going Everyone in the ground could see what then is you can do but I did leave any words. I mean never sees my very much all the boxes left him on his own very naively little run up the knee little shimmy Runner. Here we go. Great finish. It's almost like and today there's a couple of times. It's like watching rugby where you wait for the man in the pocket for a drop goal the end of the game where we none of you know, but I might there will be one person watching. Who knows. Thanks, Dad.	-1.0
1	Well, I was going to ask if I mean the back free I think that was one of the first times really we saw Cody then Duncan say sort of look pretty pretty solid. I know we've had previous games. We've spoke about it the Arsenal game and so on but forward touch on it now before we move on to the next game, how do you lot think that I know they didn't play that back for you today? But how do you lot think we've adjusted? Life without Willie Bali as well because I personally think it's doing a lot better than what I am.	1.0
3	Anyway, I think that Danka he's pretty much saved us about doesn't he like they slide in has been unreal. I was really worried and we know we can play there. But yeah, I'm real seis on the left. I think when Polly comes back I don't be harsh and then dunker I would just slap body back and on the right. So he's remembering its besiktas away using real that game. So you have to fair play to Dent Anka. I mean like I say he saved us because I was really worried when body got injured, but the way he slaughtered in has been incredible. I think I'll come over for said it last time but but I think we look better going forward with those to the back because they bring the ball in to Midfield don't like a bit more fluid than previously we retain possession a lot better as well so far.	-1.0
1	I'm not going to sing a lot Bennett but a lot of the time it is you never did. No you are right, but those two are and Cody the Freer and natural with the ball at the fit. They're all they're all midfielders. So it's natural that we are going to retain possession better under distribution is going to be better. I mean the out ball is a lot better, especially Block then Duncan part of his leftovers, right? So yeah, I think we've adjusted seamlessly tight body's not even not even gone but even got he's got to come back straight to the team.	0.0
3	They asked yeah, especially that best defender model only. I'm real even kill many think is just a really well. Yeah definitely has already promised big pressure on him as well and they're coming into that. I could have gone but you don't feel like we're going on the ball. Whereas if I lay eyes on the ball, I'm twitching like get it off him and he just passed it out money for a phone seems like that that bothering them.	1.0
1	Yeah, that might be cut short in. Everybody's hands as well. But yeah, I think we've killed mean obviously with him being that Futsal player. They're going to be quite good on the ball and so on. I think you look really comfortable especially today is Sheffield United even with the aerial Jules. I didn't do too badly will give you books up a little bit which will happen. Naturally. It could be a really good player because positioning and that he's got the they've got the football brain. You can say that it's just physically he's it isn't found a little bit wanting still but he's a big boy, and he thought I said I put a bit of size and I'm like the dummy of the pies are never as you look at pictures from when they saw into. Yeah, probably Officer I don't even in size.	1.0
3	So if they did that we killman, but the we did that would cost her and then he turned out to be his first awful easiest and in these amazing on the other hand as well like they're itchy, but Doherty's gone from being like overweight and then being like athlete who is spoilers for brewing a bad word. Sorry Danny if you listening	-1.0
1	Probably should have been a lot more than what the score lines suggested to one win in the end. Material on him in is getting the first half goals second half goal for Bournemouth Steve Cook and a red card in the first half as well for France's pure. From wolves Tom it should have been more though.	-1.0
3	Yeah, well as much alluded to earlier on with giving the goals away too easily. We're not killing games off and that's why we against against Braga and the next game should have been out of sight really but I was actually here when that game was going on and then drove back listen to on the radio and I just said it just makes the come back for the form of even more amazing when they inevitably come back in two days. You didn't know that there was one that was going to give it away at some point we Play well for 90. It was very similar to The Villa guy absolutely battered of their staff from one of our best performances with Villa and then they get a man set off as well. So I'm thinking what is going to absolutely annihilate him second half but they seem to up their game with yeah - we just I don't know what happened. But that goal from a teeny. Oh, you think it was across that? Yeah, I think mentees you think I think he meant. Well you did it again today. Maybe it's going to become his thing is that he can score from these ridiculous tight angles, but he just sits right?	-1.0
1	Yeah. That was that was definitely a shot. Shaq deal anyway if that was a cross it's an awful cross piece. It's loaded. Absolutely everyone look at the height on it and how he dips. It's not that's not cross. Its. I mean it don't matter.	-1.0
3	What is it that an audacious so good. I thought you meant it because it's probably one of them things.	1.0
1	I'll just Whack It In The Box and if I don't hello, I'm home Mom Walk In The Box and hopefully someone gets a touch on it. Yeah, that's what I think. It's a shot. He's far too clever to just whack it racquetball across the area.	-1.0
3	I don't know if a player like that shoot it from that angle. It does. I can't see why you would try to score from there.	-1.0
1	That's why I think that's why I think it's official the video of him taking free kicks in training not from that angle.	0.0
3	This part is quite small pitch anymore.	0.0
1	Yeah, he's quality and I mean he's taking a lot of the set pieces now head of Never As I think his I mean even that one in Sevilla, and we're never scored I think That was now it seems to only be taking them if it's like director for your goal. So you see he could get the dip on the shots really well, but matino seems seems to be the man. Now you have a goal as well obviously was him in his goal. Yeah material again with a set-piece a Dharma will across him heroin.	1.0
3	It makes me better at loving money fast. Yeah another great question and the way you opened up his body him and asked us to tapping of your left foot and he's on fire any at the moment scoring all those schools, but he's got a The the balls coming in.	1.0
1	Yeah and trial rights get that first time. He's like to go from standing to false full pelt in a couple of seconds. Yeah, it absolutely roasted. Harry Wilson.	-1.0
3	It's been a couple of goals like that that have just shown everything that's good about our attacking play within two or three seconds. And then we score a goal everything from that goal was perfect and showed bettina's class and think a quick-thinking tray. All right is showing that he's on the same page everybody else now and making that run and human has his His and product from compared to last year particularly good like I'm real and and if you notice all writing about 85% of the time we attacked on the right now because I think of some Jolly Joe or on the other white did that much today really was always going down the right way to take some imagery.	1.0
1	We are we are productive player that we've got everything comes on that right? I'm sorry links it really well with Doc. Yeah, definitely sees come on Leaps and Bounds and it's it looks a different player. I'll speak to some of them. Actually they saying he carries on this form. He's Rich goal scoring and assists for how much is it going to be worth it and somebody said that 18 million pounds now for a play like that.	1.0
3	It looks like an absolute bargain us. I think I think you can come and 30 million for him.	1.0
1	Definitely 30 million. Counter-attack jotter on the left him initially the right Adama was the deepest man back. Why is you know, why is he I mean to be their defensive Duty wise I think you did. Okay today, like he was actually tracking back a little bit more. But again going forward today could he could have genuinely wants that game if you want.	1.0
3	I guess he must be a nightmare to mark because the our easy it is from set to take along. It's so incredible sometime when the Villa game for the second goal loads of villa fans ringing up to W. I'm saying why didn't he tell Garcia's all one of their players say, whiny just take one? Just take him out body. Dim. Just get erect take a red card below then, you know things didn't they Ming's talking about for their freaking legendary? She's got all right moving on. Sorry. Did you go did you go to Braga boys move on. We don't mention jotters offside. That wasn't offside going as ball. Oh, yeah, like how the hell they are the block the boat flags for it straight away. If you keep slack down VAR check, it goes to college not Did you see John again Maddie you line him and some very similar thing happened today as well didn't it? But it was the referees for for blowing the whistle.	-1.0
1	Well, it's Simon who lines because it's not offside. Yeah. It's a referee's decision. You have to blow the whistle when the phase of play is stopped because you can carry on and school like he did not what that's not OV.	-1.0
3	I think he originally blue she fought him and as was offside when I originally went into him as they have a job what it was but he was on the line.	0.0
1	Oh, so this city season only put you through I'll give you a hundred. Yeah, close hundred percent sure because if you see that flag go up and your Defender you think yeah Rana flags up, but that's still go through and that's why that that's the linesman's for want to blame the rest of that because you've got to trust you linesman fully you're not going to be very rare that you ignore the law. But that's what the protocol is. No don't don't blow the show. You shouldn't the blown he it's more the lines for Russian flag. He shouldn't flag because how's the ref going to know if you click it obvious in the ref, let's hit play on. He's got a truck driver makes a question with offside.	-1.0
3	You need linesman. It was let me I'll check it. Once your mean. Do you need more chips in the balls to put on the boots lines on the pitch lasers? That's what we want.	1.0
1	Now. We are moving onto braggart on. I'm City girl a really good time. Thanks to one football preparing the PIP implants and crazy jealous to not just have a senior.	1.0
3	What has happened to my YouTube channel like that comment somebody commented on one of the poems that I put on said what has happened to this chip? I think you're quite talented Tom talented.	1.0
1	Which one they match today one. Did you he's very well spoken very eloquently put together.	1.0
3	Is no way that somebody compared it to under milk wood by Dylan Thomas very clearly.	1.0
1	You uncultured one of the greatest Welsh poems and I'll call ya video Braga to be there. We'll do it. So she bruised man.	-1.0
3	I'm sorry shows you Bruce police officers were beaten up in bra was like that cheering. Is it nah? Well if they would have we're documenting his job because he's been everywhere.	-1.0
1	Yeah anyway. Hey, everybody was good. For example football. Send us there. You know what it was great. When I think it was ridiculous that the weather, you know, it's like it go to Portugal be no set time here. It's November. All right now all day. Yeah, it'll be mild and it was it just I don't think we stepped outside and it was dry at any given point. So but apart from that lovely evening.	1.0
3	Yeah, he's got the other way the worst tropical. Yeah.	-1.0
1	The worst thing was the day like the day after the Friday when we were flying back. Back, it was still the same weather in Porto. So everyone obviously again on the plane the couple of jackets big coat and then we flew to Lisbon before flying back to England and Lisbon was like 20 degrees. So you get out the flipping trivial I transfer you sweating will you like panicking when they pitch inspection that was happening?	-1.0
3	There wasn't a pictures.	-1.0
1	Yeah, which was terrible. We saw it and I thought like it was some some your dad that put it up and everyone was just getting smashed on super box. I'll go to here who's had one Supermarket told are going I searched pitch inspection on Twitter and it was just all these people tagging Spears and Joe Edwards asking in terms of pitch him inspection and said that they spoke to the locals about it and I just laughed it off so District, this is actually gonna be used to this at that time here.	-1.0
3	Anyway, so a lot better when there's a 6000 also probably won't Mobile's fans are then I ran out of holiday so I can go I was good. I do I was a bit worried, but everyone does seem to prioritize that my brother and I thought Brian I didn't really work.	-1.0
1	so star we've I wanted to I didn't really want to do right because I think I was looking at Bishop Tyson that obviously when one football game	0.0
3	Relationship between Portugal yeah, he's been historically quite good wasn't there. I don't know if you want me to say this on a but they were never walls running but all the novels and on this. Yeah.	-1.0
1	Yeah apparently knocked him out. And if it's maybe it was stolen afterwards so cute.	-1.0
3	He's all right.	1.0
1	Yeah. Well, I mean hearing what happened. I don't think he will be but nah, it's not good that but and we and we well, we've always said that touch wood so far.	-1.0
3	Everything has been going. Well, no trouble anywhere. And then this trip but as soon as you to start going line treatment, yeah, no children cheer.	1.0
1	Yay, the Crusaders just waiting for the next round draw for us to get standard liège. Imagine around on Copenhagen soul back into the term expensive.	-1.0
3	I want I've Aroma or PSV not in the next round. You want not because of the team. I just want to go even them a bit later.	0.0
1	Going to get to Roma no stab you like Gladiators in the Colosseum.	-1.0
3	Yeah, there is a far-right chanting.	1.0
1	So should we talk about the game? What game? Oh, yes. Well, we probably 75% of the fans anyway and missed the first two goals because of the police so ensuring so we're in the queue and Emmas on One Note Down good evening. We're outside the grinding of the Braga fans or anything. We want.	-1.0
3	Yeah, we get towards it even has a scored and yeah Finn has missed it.	-1.0
1	So many things wrong so the game itself, obviously Braga took an early lead through a deflected goal through Andre jota jiminez, then equalized Doherty and adharma quickly made it 3-1 walls and the second half. We sort of collapse and it's paleo and Francis. Yo, I gotta go.	-1.0
3	He's in the start side four shots on target Regal that first goal of the bloke who shot his best mates Endeavors. And yeah, Man doesn't come off nervous to go in.	1.0
1	Yeah, and then obviously they're him in his dhoti and Adama golfing The Pick of those for me is probably that Doty got in that that ball from the cross from Johnny Johnny always cuts in and use his left foot once great cross good editor good.	1.0
3	Yeah another good hitter try all he's got his values you should have said It was wet like how you looked at that while she was saying but it was a good strike sword isn't bad.	1.0
1	Yeah. I'll set you off Tom Ford want you calling it for one week Houston absolutely coast and another five or four more.	1.0
3	I thought I knew that the bride will get back into it because I've seen this ID singles played before. I don't know what happened. You just wait awful a single doors. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I just couldn't taking that but but to be 3-1 up in to give it away is very very disappointing.	-1.0
1	I think it Obviously took it away at to go ladies disappointed but I think because a point qualified US yeah don't think it really that didn't really take much away from it. People aren't I wasn't I was dozing that way they do that. So yeah, I think yeah, I got a good side though.	-1.0
3	I think we should offensively we were we were too cautious am on you isn't it was just after we lost to Chelsea and we were playing five three two, and is really negative.	-1.0
1	Should apply for the back.	0.0
3	No, I think we should have you all three. That's that's seems to be working at the moment think that Chomp control damage to Citizen. Yeah, remember and then Bennett mess anything up in it.	-1.0
1	I'll now we will move on it to the game. We are recording in the currently on Sunday right after the game because Sheffield United's are going to be talking a little bit more about that. It disastrous start for going one-nil down lease say set score in the first minute goal and then Matt Doherty equalizing in the end in the second half. Half Harry would you recognize this game is strange when I think I don't think device I did enough to win the game.	-1.0
3	But it's yeah sloppy by both teams only really two teams in good form, obviously and Sheffield United the way they're set up to be fair to and was good. They were dirty the ref had a nightmare like give her out more bookings a shocking. Yeah, so but they sell really well and to go one-nil down of hard God. Here we go, but we grew into its second after we got we got better and better about and in the end we probably could have we could have won it but you think back to the mat chances though that Sheffield United out of what we look quite shake it the back.	-1.0
1	All four times the fries are great. They look good on the ball, but I actually think that that I don't actually think they have that many that many many chances in themselves. They lose.	-1.0
3	Okay going forward called Rick mccubbin even for your few times in the end.	0.0
1	I don't just really 42nd. I'll be forced to yeah, I think I think Kris world has settled it for the drawer there. Anyway, I mean they were	-1.0
3	Ferdinand Villas described a few light draws and we Burnley yeah, I mean if you take those all the drawers that we've had eight Drew more than anybody else in the league if you'd just be in picking Southampton or Newcastle or today or Burnley or one of those games, we would genuinely be top four contenders. And this season is a little bit like the 1516 season where it is up for grabs here live following the league already City or finished up for Spurs might get top for because Marina will just bore the and so pretty and gets the win last minute Lester. I've got a good chance but there's such turmoil amongst United and Arsenal and Chelsea with fat Frank. They can't guarantee that he's going to finish top four. So why can't we with our stable stable, you know behind the scenes and everything push for that and we got a little break from Europa League now. Yes, it's a so and we're well, I think we're only five points away now after today's point, but We should have really been trying to win today. And then we did though Trilogy when we were going through the end to try and get I think we actually played really well today second half we did first office. So I think if he took the first minute of the game, I think we were the first minute. Yeah, generally if we just to the first minute, I think we played really well generally was gonna make it off yourself and you can see it in the first minute though Jim why you think we can see it in the first minute still asleep because we were playing that we changed end because we kicking towards the South Bank First rather than the North Bank. I genuinely thought oh, my dad actually said I thought that he said this is going to confuse them and they're going to start shakily. He said that and then they can see them the first we lose the tops of the mr. Dunn because like we always do when we go to anfield and we win the toss week making the top attack. The cop first is a you know, and and then as the game is going on the first half of there's 15 minutes left in the first half and I felt like we had to score because we were going towards the South bank. I'll be honest. I don't even know so first time because he always used to be	1.0
1	He was a yeah.	1.0
3	Yeah, Kenny jackett changed it.	0.0
1	But yeah, I've just been very rare very yeah, he's very rare thing when you can't blame those teams picked used to kick rather than swap sighs, you know, so yeah, I think today was will struggle to live with Sheffield, you know is energy levels. They were they were every second ball. They will get it and perhaps they are the a little bit hungover from first the people say the professional athletes playing two games in a week. She'll be an excuse. It's not an excuse to you come up against professional athletes or implied. At all in the way. Yeah, so there is going to be he's a difference there. But I thought Jeff Ward United in terms of how they play with pretty poor. It was direct. He's running the channels. It was it was crap football, but it's so effective not the only game where you look alike. They goal kicks. They push everyone up they make the volcano literally all the players were probably 10 10 meter radius of each other because they know they're going to win that second ball and I can get more they so much the second door.	-1.0
3	Belgium son's voice we should go to match their energy level of charm Light trailer over and done the wing as well. He had a free blokes on him every time he did once I come on obviously got a few balls in but mad they remind me a lot of when Wigan first came up or when black ball first came up and they've got that on my God. I can't believe we're in the Premier League. Let's just run like mad all the time and they are getting tired in games. That's why they threw away a lead against man you died last week. They obviously got tired today throughout the last 20 minutes. They would really jaded and that's when we were getting better. Better and better and that's why we are you know, that's why we score so many late goals because we are so fit and we can keep on going experience and we display the same in the first minutes we do in the 90s when you think as well. I think you said about us like planning Europe. I results after playing in Europe already good. I don't think that's the way man see we've had a few of she draws in there, but I'm not thinking David McCall drink go.	1.0
1	Me in football manager versus Ebola Burton Albion from liters of the Premier League and I like we did we did struggle so too much some for the their energy because I didn't they are at MacArthur would absolutely adore that exactly. Bipolar, if you'd brought this all on you probably want to do more than just her it could totally would've done more than him and there's no it's a bit concerning and I think they need to they will need to strengthen January and if new no does Stowe then we're no no studies.	-1.0
3	They will check by having a bite the other one. He's clapping every standard. I was January. I was reloading all know. I don't think you'll go now. I know you'd be mad too. I was worried at one point because like you say no smoke without fire. When his favorite. I'm thinking on God, but got it we've had we've edited that bit out. Yeah, a bit of interesting chapter.	-1.0
1	We could have gone to the bench today.	0.0
3	I brought net1 or control anybody or leak under who is the young man what little white lady look under that leaky played them. Yeah, I'm sorry leak be generally genuinely against PSG and one of the one of the kids said after the And he said he looked like he could be in our class. Yeah, because he was he's tiny but he was decent player. Do you sent him it was okay when we play a game?	1.0
1	So you all really excited about that Owen other Sally so against today's on the bed you do. He's an absolute decline. Yeah. He's a big audience a-wing backwards. Midfielder but dropped started using him as a Centre back.	1.0
3	So it's all works to bit like playing. We haven't he's very mobile.	1.0
1	Very White's contracts up at the end of the year though, and apparently all still living across from him.	0.0
3	And as I'm real cross when it for though is after the celebration he left a bit under a cloud.	1.0
1	It was rumors that he was already speaking with Stoke before What was its own demand? That was one of the reasons why let him go but every time we play Four Walls, he did really well and it's called lots of goals lots of important goals and to obviously hear that new style of so close. I love the phone you had a phobia on the back of one of my shirt the first line that's it 2015 beginning of 2015 that attack until Easter was the best attacking football. I just go if I miss a car man, I'm going to hold this field and choosing youth as well as the choosing on a Wednesday night and we had vampire. Terra di KO F OB soccer. Yeah, we just we just like crap defend. We talked about 71 our souls with the last time.	1.0
3	Drumstick and off as well. He's gonna get sent off you give even my dad found in the early on when he lost the ball. They got had to play it down. So the first minute it's apply some games you look he just got out of bed and he's so like doping did anyone see that someone put on Twitter of like a like a lizard run across the desert. Yeah then danke when he has called to come on.	0.0
1	Maybe she had a referee run as well proper locks all pail. Yeah. It was terrible today. Should I think it's David.	-1.0
3	Usually I'm the referees but he was awful today that they should have had George Bulldog should have been sent off. That's insane. That's what I thought. Yeah, he was stung. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah fair enough. That's fine.	-1.0
1	The first one you can check if the rest blowing the whistle.	0.0
3	No, you didn't blows whistle blows whistle. So the first one annoyed me because nobody in the ground chapter 4 penalty nobody in the South Bank called for penalty. No player put their hand up for a penalty yet. We have to stop the game and look at a screen that says check in penalties ages as well. I didn't know we didn't know if it was for handball or a push on top. Dirty or whatever it was. It really really fast rights for straight smooth.	-1.0
1	ER it was good apparently check as well down the South Bank and John hoeven it yeah, we had a penalty kick as well. Do ya first time I'll definitely still we still haven't heard anything.	1.0
3	Go for a sinner. Yeah, but which either means that the second after season we're going to get a low six points given to us season. The Nevers goalie is money not even true. They would have rolled that out, Oregon man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.	-1.0
1	Yeah. Yeah, right then we will now move on we were of quell quickly talk about the fixtures upcoming as well. So obviously another draw continuing the unbeaten run in the Premier League and now it's a pretty busy this Member schedule so walls are play West Ham midweek, right and next week. She kicked ass in our final Europa League group game and then going into a busy Christmas Pippi period Spurs Norwich City Liverpool and then Watford in New Year as well. So pretty hefty one Lads. I mean in terms of the next as I two games West Ham and brighten four to six points reveal.	1.0
3	If you look at them in isolation, we should win both of those games, but it's Wolves and it's in a series of games and I think if we took four points would be pretty up.	1.0
1	I think people have written West Ham off, but I have to make it really tough to watch especially against they were going to be full of confidence just have to waste time from last season turn up because out crap.	-1.0
3	Yeah, we turn them over didn't really bad. Um, yeah, that's right best performance. Yeah.	1.0
1	Yeah. Yeah. I think I think West Ham's going to be a really tough game. They're going to be G deep after the after the Chelsea when it and brighten as well under under Harry Potter that they've really turned a corner.	-1.0
3	Corner, and I've given him what five or six-year deal screams around party went to that last year will be absolutely battered I've ever lost one. Now how we dance glimmery deflection?	-1.0
1	I think they both could be tough to see how much is a it's a tough place to go. So four points is really stick and I think reasonable. Yeah, definitely. I don't know. It doesn't matter how they come with us a pointer or three points away. But yeah, I'd say four points, but after that it's we could have range from anything to zero point mean if we don't if you don't lose one of them was that we're gonna be 11.	-1.0
3	Yeah, and when the parameter Right on over a lot of drawers in there, but it's some achievement. It's a quarter of the season. Nine games is a huge really hard to be. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, really sticking we always stay in games even when we're not playing particularly. Well if we're just one kneel down going into the last 20 minutes you feel like we've got a chance of getting at least a point. We got better and better don't music. Yeah.	1.0
1	It's a bit strange though this season because we're having really good 45-minute performances. It's frustrating its orbit. It's not always the first or second half. Season where first off we terrible. Yeah II RP great and then not taking Chief what you're not into account the past four or five games the first ask Ben grass second a spinning back is short.	-1.0
3	So this one, you know, we said I think we mentioned last time that he's the whole thing that he keeps saying is that we can play well for spells, but we need to be able to play well for 90 minutes and we're not at that level yet. We're working towards its what yesterday and we're getting closer because it's not just a 45 minutes and then the second half there's a little crossover. A little you know about an hour or so we play well for now, but it's when we do play with and 90 minutes, I think will bloat.	1.0
1	Anyway, I think it's getting there but we're slamming and Brian are going to be tough games and no gimmes by any stretch of imagination on Amazon Prime minute West up.	-1.0

He of course a big follower the academy team but he says with a squad selection today is pretty obviously with the numbers on the bench. Is this show a lack of first-team squad depth	-1.0
3	Pretty obvious in yeah, that's the pin the that was the concern when it going into it small Squad, but new nighlok small squads and if we get any if you've got a few more injuries, not just Bali, we're really struggling at me. I think January maybe we also have this don't me you need to get defender of need to get them a stronger body. But Ruben Diaz has now gone 200 that takes some generous Bend is that their Portuguese clubs are ready to sell them.	-1.0

He's got to go back home actually devastated about who's better Tom Cody lovely house that's a letter to a friend not to speak speak the comment sections in trouble now, so I'm really happy to come here comments. All this that's dog song is Right Enochs all this stuff about new no going to ask not and the fact that he didn't make any subs and that he's putting into 23 players on the bench could be right Jeff. I need some money desperately and the the story that came out just after the summer transfer window where it was wolves didn't know where they were going to be in the Europa League. So they were going to invest we know definitely going to be in a plane at least two more games and you would hope for maybe eight more games to get to at least the quarterfinals. So give me another two first-class.	1.0

3	Shantabai, it's not an obligation. That was it.	1.0
1	Then we cover it with re calling because they've got an option on a character as well as well have my up front. So when I face Yugi can't record it now. He's he's not good enough to Warrant calling back. I disagree. I like that's one thing. I think we should call it your player buffing with the current stay at the school. Now, I would have him yeah long-term he for me.	-1.0
3	We'd have him for half a season and then I'd want to see someone but he could do both as medical plan the wing and he weren't too bad for you like the middle. If you do any when didn't either we just won we just won better cover the cut and cover that will challenge the first thing because all right ice like Cody off right sometimes but he's got nobody really who can challenge him for that position then Duncan maybe could Bennett has played there when Cody hasn't but I mean, he's not gonna pressure code. So it's just that's all I want is comp good competition is good right wing back. We have got any competition right wing left wing open. So we have got an important show me call being and - yeah, did you listen to the mark Kennedy podcast or I've listened to you and I'm sorry for protein and that's right. But yeah, even Eve said that the cleared yet. He said it got to the point where no Challenge and you just couldn't get motivated. He said he was playing Robert. She didn't care. She knew was always going to be honest.	0.0
1	I think I think I tweeted a couple of weeks ago like we can have a player like I think it was relay home Betty. You can play two games in a row pie really poorly, but it doesn't matter because you'll still be in the team because no one else knocking on door behind you and I think Ben it stays at walls are numbered. I know he's had that injury and something this isn't made hounding him again before we get to the comments, but I genuinely do think that's like benioff in it.	-1.0

However, you cannot select any players of the current team because it's going to be pretty obvious that the team would decade is going to be full of the current crop. So someone said was not the team of the decade than is it. Well, they're like and then I put the island from Hangar big if we've all the some we fade if we if anyone picks we have do it seemed to dick it decayed dedicated to it.	-1.0

I couldn't lie couldn't lie out this decade. He barely barely plays a plane but I you remember Harry you remember our forest of other product is what you barely played about your front also, like caustic having a kind of a famous style and academic Kevin MacDonald up front because he's my favorite ever walls player Ebanks Blake.
