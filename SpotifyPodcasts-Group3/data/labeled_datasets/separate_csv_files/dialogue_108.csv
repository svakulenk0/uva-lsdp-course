1	I want to share with you my story of my appreciation of self. Or another way to put it it's myself love story.	1.0
3	So I didn't even understand the whole self-love thing until like pretty recently to be honest. I kind of I guess any type of healing Journey any type of growth inner growth type of Journey.	-1.0
1	It really kind of just Falls along the lines of self-love and sense, right? So my journey started in I will say the 10th grade ninth grade summer around 10th grade. So around that time I had I got coaching Miracles coaching, you know, they work with Law of Attraction but also really heavy on subconscious mind programming like NLP neuro-linguistic programming. So it's basically we do this these deep visualization almost hypnotic exercises that take me to you know, certain memories. It's traumas and just limiting beliefs and things of that. Nature and we cleared it. You're going to notice that all why I've noticed that all these negative emotions. These stuck traumas are all tied to limiting beliefs without limiting beliefs. There will be no trauma and that may be controversial but this is coming from someone who's done the work, right? And this is what I've experienced.	-1.0
3	So that was that I did a lot of subconscious mind stuff, right and I start to feel better about myself because Because my whole life I've never felt good enough. That was the major thing.	1.0
1	I always felt like shit. I always felt like damn. I'm such a loser I suck at everything and I can't impress nobody blah blah, and I've always wanted to feel good enough.	-1.0

1	I think it was. Two years at least one of the heat year into this subconscious mind clearing Journey that I work with this lady named Shelly lefko. And you know, she heard her husband. They they're like the best at this clearing limiting beliefs stuff like the best. And I was working with her and you know, I was telling her, you know, I've been doing a lot of work. I'm trying to feel good enough, but you know, like there's something a little bit off. I've made a lot of progress but I don't necessarily feel like I'm over it. I don't feel good enough and then we spent an hour working on this going back to my childhood going up and looking at my past conditioning and then but any of the conversations The last few words. She said absolutely shifted my Paradigm completely. she said nobody is special. because everybody is special and because everybody special nobody is special. And boom that was it.	1.0
3	That was the moment. I could feel that shift within me as I realized the truth the truth that you don't have to prove. No one has no one is born having to proof if they're good enough or not. We are all born the fact that we are born the fact that we exist makes us good enough. We are always already always will be good enough. We are all special. We are all completely special does not matter if you have certain abilities or not doesn't matter if you failed a billion times in your past. You will always be special but everybody is special. So nobody is extra special special or any less special than anybody else no matter which Soul was human what color how tall you are how big you are how small you are it don't matter. And so, you know I go that was a big shift for me that realization.	1.0
1	Right and I felt like oh my gosh, I no longer have this negative burden, right? So that was cool. And then so I and then in 2016 as many of you know, I had that deep experience where so this is a few months later after that. I had this deep experience where I became president. I became really present and my mind stopped and I This deep peace. I achieved this realization of self. I realized I am. Not my mind. I understood that I was I was Consciousness and beyond that once you realize that you are liberated.	1.0
3	But anyways, so, you know now I have this deep peace and I've gone through the whole the whole, you know, like realization that everything that nobody special because everybody special right? So and so like I was cool.	1.0
1	But you know, it wasn't like I was waking up every day and thinking oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I love myself. Like dude. You're just you're just a total stud. You're super special.	-1.0
3	Like it wasn't like that.	-1.0

1	I don't feel not special anymore, and I've noticed wow like as I'm growing like I am definitely somewhat extra extraordinary in terms of like just my abilities against my peer like or just you know, like around the common people the people at work and just everybody else in my life. I was definitely I stood out like I just had because of my presence because of the fact that my mind is basically silent, you know like you when you're acting on Divine instincts.
