1	I'm so happy to be here.	1.0
3	I'm good. You know I have to say I want to tell everyone this little story but the moment I met you and we actually met at the So You Think You Can Dance store the other day. Yes, we did. Yes. We did. We watched I watched act one I missed act too because I had to go to says oh good. I'm such a good tour. I can't wait, but I was like she is so petite and I because I saw you with Derek store, which was incredible, and I thought I thought she was like five nine you dance very tall and that's amazing quality.	1.0
1	Thank you every Every single person who's never met me before in life. Thanks. I'm like this gigantic girl and every single time. They meet me. They're like, you're so short.	1.0
3	No Mike petite. You are petite concise, right? You know, it's interesting because one of my notes always when I was dancing was to dance bigger dance out dance floor and I didn't know I wasn't always able to translate that and I was like watching you dance. I'm like, that's what they wanted me to do. I'm not Sure, I ever captured it correctly. But you just dance like you have limbs that go on for days.	1.0
1	Thank you.	1.0
3	I try really hard to stretch you're doing a good job. So don't worry about that. Well, welcome to Dancing with the Stars honestly.	1.0
1	Oh my God, thank you so much. This is a like has been the best experience so far and good. Everyone is just like super nice the cast The Crew the just everyone is just so welcoming and right away you feel like you're just part of their family's amazing.	1.0
3	Saying I'm glad to see that and I love that you're sharing the experience with Pasha your husband, of course because I think what was interesting I spoke with you. I don't know if you remember but I did a quick interviewed everyone on Derrick storm. And we did like a phone or a I think everyone just passed her on the phone. We're like next next you remember that number? Okay. It's good to put a face now. Yes, but what I think was really interesting was that Pasha was the one who actually encourage you to do Derrick storm. Yes, and I you know you guys A team and you guys have to make decisions as a team. You have a studio you compete together.	1.0
1	So I was glad to see the Dancing with the Stars was something that you were able to yeah, it really is do it was so great because thing was Derek story was my first tour ever and it was hard because it was three months long with the preparation and everything and that meant I had to move to California for just a little bit for the rehearsal period and being that we live in New York not to see him for three months was Only extremely difficult so he did come out and see me like time to time. But of course, it's not the same when you're living together know right away the moment I got Dirk's called to be on this tour Tasha said I don't care what you do. You're not even going to think about you're doing this tour. He's like it's not just for you. It's for us because we want the world to see way more basically ballroom dancing has been seen as all Glitz and glamour, you know, that's and rhinestones and which is great but great hands. Right and at the same time like even in our competitive career whenever we danced Ballroom, it was really more pedestrian type of Ballroom where you get up and you wear jeans and t-shirts and you make it sexy without all the rhinestones which we saw in World of Dance right season 2. Yes, exactly. And that's exactly what we wanted to deliver. So the fact that I was able to kind of go into Derek store and like really fresh out of the competition floor and just do what I love to do and just kind of Be as partner on tour, which was great at the same time. It was just so great for Pasha and his family. So it was it was definitely something I shouldn't have thought twice about but the only reason I did thought think twice about it was just because Pasha was in New York.	1.0
3	So that was really difficult well, and it's wonderful to have that support because not everyone does get that type of support say go do the tour.	1.0
1	This is for us absolutely and it's actually funny because when we did get the call that we're going to be on Dancing With the Stars the first thing was They called me in there like Daniella we have great news and we have not-so-great news. And the first thing they said is Basha is going to have a celebrity partner the season and I was like, oh my God, that's amazing. That's the best news ever and then they're like, well this season we just won't have one for you this season, but you know, it's we hope you can still like be okay with him being like are you kidding me this doing Dancing with the Stars? Absolutely like the fact that we're just here together and Bosh. It's too like we're both living this together. It's we're in this together. So whether I have one or he has one, it doesn't matter. It's where a family and the fact that we're we can both live.	1.0
3	Our dreams here is just we're just so grateful and you book being California together that that helps quite a bit. Did you participate at because you were on tour, I think when this happened the actual audition, I know they had an audition in the spring or were you guys were you on tour and submitted a video?	1.0
1	I actually I never got a chance to come in and do the audition. Pasha was doing the audition while I was on tour and then they asked me to just submit a video in and I did that like I've got some stuff with Derek Hough.	-1.0
3	Would you like it? I totally did that.	1.0
1	I totally would do like Derek. Are you okay with me submitting our video?	1.0
3	He's like sure he just admitted it but I understand I mean what else would you submit I'd be like I'm dancing with Derek Hough every night it was he when a couple more about like six on the show you you know, is that a good reference and I was so lucky that he was able to do that with me.	1.0
1	And just submit it together. That was amazing.	1.0
3	So that's incredible. And I you know, I'm really kind of like I was thinking about you today because what you guys decide to do going on World of Dance season 2 the steps that have happened since that appearance, you know, I feel like one thing wouldn't have happened. If you hadn't decided to do World of Dance to begin with I feel like it just opened The Floodgate hundred percent honestly all the stars aligned and it's it's been insane because again,	1.0
1	World of Dance wasn't in our plans. So they found us they asked us to be on the show and they found us through our YouTube video.	-1.0
3	Okay, because I know they slide into DM is a lot on Instagram.	1.0
1	Yes, and that's actually how they found us. And we basically we were in like the jeans and t-shirt kind of thing and they saw it on YouTube they loved it and they're like, we need something like this on our type of show. So we're like, you know, what why not we can compete and we can do something like this that's super creative on the side and it's the best platform where we can just show what we're all about because there you're not in a ballroom dance competition there you're in just you're in a mix of just gorgeous dancers. And again, you're just super grateful of a be there and you look around just like the best hip-hop and contemporary dancers and Jazz dancers old from all over the world and credible. It's so it was so so cool. So that decision was super easy. We're like, all right. Let's try, you know, try something new. We've never done that before and we are so grateful we did and we did. Make it that far but like we definitely got great exposure from there's people started contacting us and recognizing us for what we do and that was the biggest thing and it was just again, we're just super grateful to be there.	1.0
3	I've noticed that because we've had a lot of the World of Dance contestants here in this studio and making it different parts of the competition whether we've had winners and we've had people that made it halfway or people that you know, made it even just around and it's been interesting because they said everyone has Said the exposure is unbelievable. It's a global show and the benefits that they have reaped just from appearing on the show.	1.0
1	No matter what the result was has been incredible for their career 100% I mean, I remember just waking up like we did our episode of the world the I think it was like the first round or something qualifiers. Yeah, and I wake up in the morning and I have probably like two thousand followers like it was in so overnight. Yeah. It was Insanity are oh, there we are.	1.0
3	Yes, and how you do it was coming. I love it that you're like hey, here we go. Yeah, um, we're did you know Derek before you did World of Dance and just from beat? No, I did not interesting.	1.0
1	I knew of him and I think we bumped into each other like time to time because I don't know if you guys know who she really balances. She's pretty much like my dance mom. She's marked ballots as Mom.	1.0
3	We are very familiar. Shirley's been in the studio many times.	1.0
1	Yeah. She is honestly just The best dance mom ever she's taking care of me since I was nine years old and just directed me and in anything and everything and just wanted me to try everything and succeed in life. So basically she was my go-to and being that were really close with each other you were in the orbit of like are exact. Yeah my Derek Mark really like always bumping into each other and Mark I'm closer to but yeah before World of Dance, we don't really know each other so fascinating.	1.0
3	Yeah, Shirley Ballas let like since you mentioned her I mean I think we should talk about her because anyone who's never met Shirley Ballas this she's a queen. She is a queen not only is she a world-class Ballroom dancer herself. She's on the head judge on Strictly Come Dancing. If I highly recommend that you go to YouTube and start searching for some of her videos with Corky Ballas and some of their dances because they are spectacular.	1.0
1	I mean she does not lose shape. She's like you go into a lesson with her and I'm very visual. So for me, it's very important for my teacher to be able Able to show me what they mean and rather than just verbally explaining it. I need to see it. Right. So the fact that she can even do the things she does is remarkable. She gets up. She does her back basic into fan and some Ballroom step since like you don't want to you don't want to actually go after that because you're like, I don't want to follow that direction.	-1.0
3	I love that. She's still they'll throw her into dances on Strictly Come Dancing and she's just like I got this here we go a hundred percent.	1.0
1	I mean that woman is just she's an iron.	0.0
3	Eddie what have you learned from her because I also think that she's a good life lesson type of Mentor. Absolutely.	1.0
1	So I actually posted recently on my Instagram a picture and it was just like a picture of me and just like very open. So personally, I was always very shy and I never really wanted to try new things and I was very close and Just in general I would I like to be in my bubble and ever and ever like to try anything new. So she was always trying to get me to do different shows and whatnot. And then she always said to me trust the process. This is something that since I was a little kid she was just telling me non-stop if I always doubted my like if I doubted myself or whatever it was she said trust the process everything happens for a reason if your I remember just like losing one competition. We were like next in the final or something like that and I remember coming out of that cup. Shouldn't and I was just so sad. I was like, oh my God, whatever I'm doing. It's just not happening. It's I don't know. What like what what else could I possibly do to be in that final and this that and the other and she's like trust the process. It happened for a reason and it definitely did because I remember the next competition. I was so hungry for it and I wasn't I was just trying to do I wasn't trying to compete with anybody else. I was really just competing with myself and trying to improve myself more and I remember that petition ended up in the final and doing really well. So like things like that. She always let me know that everything happened for a reason and if something didn't happen it's meant to be that way and funny enough about two years ago. We tried out for Dancing With the Stars. Oh you did and we didn't get it and I was like all this you know, this is something I really want. I've I've always watched the show and I'm like super big fan and it's something I've always wanted to do. When we got the call that we weren't going to be on it. I was actually really sad and I was talking to her about it and she's like then it wasn't your time. It's right just continue doing what you're doing. And that's actually when we went on World of Dance. Oh, yeah, we want door closes exactly how the door open and that year. We actually tried out we auditioned for World of Dance. We got onto World of Dance and we kept competing. We kept perfecting our technique and and then when we did get the call for this year's Dancing with the Stars real	1.0
3	Like okay Shirley's right again. This is why she's always right.	1.0
1	She's always here always right and that's exactly why it happened and now being on the show. I still have my technique that I was perfecting for those extra two years, you know and trying to be the best that I could be and now I'm really grateful.	1.0
3	I can just bring it on that show, you know, so well we are, you know, I was at the show last night and everyone I talked to was like Danielle and Pasha are like the best dancers know they are so complementary they are so happy that you are there they love watching. Dance spoiler alert guys, Brandon Armstrong was here before Daniela because we pre-taped an episode that's going to are October 22nd because I'll be in Barcelona so I know I can't wait but he was bragging about the two of you. He's so sweet and but everyone's really appreciative of your talents and what you guys are both bringing to the show this year.	1.0
1	Thank you. We're having a lot of fun. And again, it's it's nice to have like that appreciation, you know, because sometimes you do do a job and it's kind of like right next, you know, so and here people appreciate what you do no matter who you are. So we're just so blessed to be on the show. Honestly. It's been nothing but an amazing journey so far.	1.0
3	So so for people who follow the show, we know we are seeing all the pros but they're celebrities. But what has your role been kind of on a day-to-day basis with Keo where you don't have the celebrities, but if you're needed for big dances your there, are you going to rehearsals are you helping out if they need, you know someone to sort of shadow?	0.0
1	Okay, so basically what they're doing this year is the Tau Chi oh and I see you and I are the newest like not the newest. Sorry Josh and I are the newest Pros but q and R are the pros that don't have celebrity Partners this year and it's because basically as people get eliminated or they usually like would go home and they would whatever this season Once you get eliminated you kind of join the pros. So like for example Brandon was eliminated with Mary now, he's joining Keo and I so it becomes more like a professional group of people like dance together and different numbers. So what we do is basically we're also hired so God forbid anyone gets hurt that day of the performance. We feel like fill in for that step if anything up. Yeah knock on wood think got everything. Okay, that's one thing. Another thing is we're going to be in every opening number q and I are actually doing the how tos this season. It's which I love you think it's	1.0
3	So fun, I think it's been important to to describe like this is what the judges are looking for.	1.0
1	This is the content it makes a lot more sense to every 100 percent and the fact that we get to do just some basic steps together and just show America what it's supposed to look like. So like let's say Argentine to our just a regular Tango, right Ballroom Tango. They show like I don't know. How long is it like 20 seconds of it, but they show what it's supposed to look like. So in the audience at home is watching they can relate to it. Okay, that's what it's supposed to look like. Well his I'm wasn't exactly like that. So I guess I see what Lana is talking about. Exactly. It's tough.	1.0
3	Like there's a connection now, so I think that's so smart of them to do because people do forget what it's actually supposed to look like and because in the prior Seasons, we've kind of gone away from some of the ballroom and some of the other styles kind of came in and then it was a fusion style but Going Back to Basics I think makes a lot of sense for the show.	1.0
1	Yeah, so cute and I get to do that and we have so much fun together. He's great. He's so fun. We had him here about a month ago. I love him. Yeah, he's a great dancer. He's a great human being Thanks for dealing with him on a regular basis is so much fun. Like rehearsals. Don't feel like rehearsals. It just feels like we're hanging out as friends, you know, so it's been really fun and also on the days off that we don't have anything. We like to just come into the studio and just keep practicing our Basics and perfecting them. So when they do need us, we always look like the best that we can possibly start all the time. So no matter what we always have an agreement that we show up to the studio and we practice as much as we can together so that lets say for the opening number if they need us they call us and we're ready to go at any	1.0
3	any moments, you know, that's what they had happens with other athletes on sports teams where they're called Off the Bench. Well, if you're called in at any time, you have to be ready to go and then also shows that there's a lot of effort behind the scenes to producers take notice of that I have that's important.	1.0
1	Yeah, and it's great because I actually love dancing at him because he's so much bigger and taller. Hmm. It's it makes me feel more like secure and like a woman and you know, he's very masculine as a dance very strong. Yeah. So I feel like we work really great together good.	1.0
3	I'm really happy to hear that. I love Kyo. I have nothing but fantastic that he's so positive to yes, and that is very infectious. I think when someone walks in a room and kind of sets the tone, you're like kyo's here. Yeah. I'm really happy and everything else and I saw him at Derek's where I know that he came to see you guys. I actually didn't see him there. He was there.	1.0
1	He said he's ahead of me and I was like, I didn't see you and he's like how you just like right up quickly and you're like, hey, I'm sorry. I was like, so in the zone that I didn't like seeing her. I promise you he was there I can vouch.	-1.0
3	- right. Yeah, say hello and have a quick conversation with him. Brandon was talking about the fact you guys are headed to Disneyland this week to film which I think is going to be so incredibly exciting and I was like, I would just want to go down there and watch because you guys have no idea what's coming. It's gonna be insane in a the best way possible you get to work with Zach woodlee Have you ever worked with fact before?	1.0
1	I haven't but we just had our first rehearsal for the opening number and he's so cool. He's just so cool to work dick. It's like boom boom boom. Boom. Boom done very fast with your great-aunt just he has like this break flow about him to you know, like he does bits and pieces of choreography, but then when he fuses them together, it just works like everything kind of just flows one piece into the other and you kind of don't even have to think about it.	-1.0
3	It just your body just does it so, it's great what I love about his choreography and he did Grease live is that he creates something that's so iconic like grease you're like, oh, well, I know how this number goes. Nope. Watch what Zacks going to do. He's going to give you a whole like different spin on a classic. Eric but he also has a High School Musical the series is coming out. Yeah, he's got a lot, you know in the mix so he's someone that is out there working all the time. So I love the shows kind of bringing in like when you guys work with cat Burns a couple weeks ago.	1.0
1	So great. She's already so good. She's also really knowledgeable, you know, like when she talks to you about the camera angles and just all the different styles you should do and like more from to like she just knows her craft, you know, so and I don't know if a lot of people	1.0
3	I did an interview with with cat the week you guys worked with her but there was concept changes at the last minute and she had to change she she had worked on something for three weeks and they're like, we're not going to go in this direction.	-1.0
1	We're going to different direction and she had to start from square one about three days before but being on a show like this, like if something doesn't work, you have to change it, you know, right there should be a lot of like little tiny changes here and there but when there's a drastic change she was able to just snap into it and just like Curry. Eight the coolest great.	1.0
3	I love that number to yeah, and that's the talking about being like flexible flexible and like nimble. That's what they talked about and Cat Burns knocked it out of the park with that. Yeah. Do you wind up helping Pasha at all with Tom's his numbers with Kate?	1.0
1	Absolutely Yeah, we actually do the choreography a lot together in our living room.	1.0
3	So but how great is that? You just comes home and he's like, all right. I got this idea.	1.0
1	Yeah. It's like all right wides are due tomorrow. Let's let's do some Cory. I'm like, let's do it, you know make it happen best in our living room. Is because our mind just like really even for competitive career if we needed to do some kind of showcase every choreography that we've ever done together was done in our living room and that was always our best one whenever we went to the studio. It just didn't work. I think we were just like so stressed about time when you're home. There's no time restriction at night you just go and you can't look kind of like look at some YouTube videos get inspired and just sit have coffee and things just go.	1.0
3	Well you're in your own environment to so there wasn't this pressure of like well we rented The studio for two hours and actually we have to be out of there because someone else is coming on it or something. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big difference. You guys were big office fan. So when Pasha got paired with Kate, this must have been a little ridiculous. Okay. So let me tell you the story. It's good. It's a good one.	-1.0
1	Yeah, so, okay. Basically we had a meet and greet for the Dancing with the Stars cast and we didn't know who was going to be on it. We had no idea what kind of celebrities wanted to do the season, so we're kind of just we also got the call that We're going to be on dancing stars three days before Good Morning America.	1.0
3	So and you guys live in New York and you're having us even though Good Morning America's in New York. You still 2-pack of your life because you're like guys were moving to LA but that's a whole another story.	0.0
1	So we knew three days before. So again, we come in like we're setting up for the meet and greet Bashas like iron shirt were obviously turning on the office and funny enough. It was on live TV, so that was great. So watching the office and I'm like crap, you know, I have to go to this meet and greet right now, and I just really To finish this episode. It was like so good. I think it's the one when Jim proposes to Pam or something like that and I'm like, oh my God, this is the best like so good. Just want to watch it and we're like, okay, whatever. We'll just we'll go on Netflix later and like finish watching the episode. I'm like, okay, so we go to the meet and greet. And Sasha Farber turned around to me and he's like, oh my God Meredith is here. I'm like, what? Wait, who's Meredith? Yeah. Wait. What do you mean? He's like Danny Meredith is here. I'm like, what are you talking about? I turn around and she's standing right behind me and I'm like, you're in my living room.	1.0
3	You're in my living room right now.	0.0
1	What are you doing behind me? Like I was so shocked. I was mind-blowing.	-1.0
3	It's like your TV opened up and she stepped into the living room the craziest thing this far to be honest.	1.0
1	Like I just turn around she's right there and I'm like, oh my God, I don't know how that what do I do with my hands? Like I was like literally I was like, okay, I have to go talk to her. So Josh is freaking out obviously because he doesn't know who's his celeb is going to be it. I'm like Pasha we need to go say hi to her and I obviously like hugged her like a crazy fangirl, but it's okay. She still loves me.	1.0
3	She's so nice. She's so nice.	1.0
1	Yeah. She's like the coolest and I'm like Pasha. I don't care what you you're going to have her. Like celebrity partner, please. Like do whatever you can't he's like obviously he can't do anything about it.	1.0
3	But I'm like, please make it happen like praying.	1.0
1	Oh my God that she would be the best partner for him, especially because it's his first season. She's so cool. She's so funny. She's the most humble person like she's like just the greatest human being you know, so I'm like I'm like the best would be for him to get this partner and then I'm like after Good Morning America. Are we still don't know who's With who and then finally we found out and we were on cloud nine. It was just the best feeling ever and it's so great because right away like even at the meet and greet we had a great chemistry together good and it's so funny because there was like a picture for the Good Morning America cast and we happen to be standing all three of us next to each other like partial. Look. It's like our family portrait here like we made this happen. Yeah.	1.0
3	It was so cool. She's just a cool and I think what's important to is that Kate was very open to having Pasha because when you get told Have the new Pro sometimes people are like, whoa! Wait a minute. I want the pro that's been here for five six seasons. She was right away. She was like, he's the perfect partner for me.	1.0
1	Oh my God. He's honestly the greatest human being he's just like so so I mean knock on wood thing. Like we've been together for ten and a half years and we have yet to have a big fight knock what I'm telling it's like the craziest thing because he's Buddha literally to get his very even-keeled, isn't he? So and I'm very straightforward. So for me, like if something bothers me, like I say it right away. There's no like, oh nothing's wrong. If there's something wrong. You'll know there's something wrong.	1.0
3	Yeah. You're like a mad.	1.0
1	Yeah, and this is why you know, and he's like, oh my God, I'm so sorry like, okay like we always talk so knock on wood. We have yet to fight good and he's just so inspiring to and you're not in a great mood. He knows how to like lift you up and make you feel comfortable. And I think that's what she needs as well because no one really knew what she can do on the show and you know, She's super talented when she does but no one has ever seen her dance before and that's difficult when you're not a dancer, you know, so I feel like he's the perfect partner for her to just make her feel comfortable and no matter what just support her and they work so well together. They have the best chemistry.	1.0
3	So I'm just so happy for him and for her that they get to work well together, you know, and that's really special to because having your first celebrity on Dancing With the Stars, you'll always have that memory and you want it to be a good one and So I love that it's playing out and I love that. The fans are reacting to their partnership to yeah, people are really enjoying them super positive.	1.0
1	I mean, he's just so lucky to have her and vice versa, you know, like they're just so perfect for each other.	1.0
3	I was asking her last night in the Press line at Dancing with the Stars just how her comedy has helped her because she is a physical comedian when you watch her on the office and she said, you know, I don't dance but I was a good imitation. That was actually pretty good. I've watched a little bit of the office myself, but she's at least an understanding of how her body moves and I think that has sort of helped her.	1.0
1	It doesn't perfect her Ballroom technique, but it is definitely really good at like jazz your type things and like the Pumped kind of dance move. She's really natural at it. Like there's some things. I remember Posh. I came home from one of the first like rehearsals he has with her and they did a Cha-Cha and they had like this like funky move in there. He's like, it's just I didn't teach like I don't have to teach her that she just did it naturally and she just made it look great. So he's like I have to use that because her like comedic skills and like the way she moves her body when she does do her comedy is very simple like similar to the Cha-Cha or Jazzy or quick subtype 5, so it's very easy for him to teach her that kind of stuff. But when it comes to the technique, obviously, it's very difficult, right? She does a great job learning it. So there's definitely a great sense of her body awareness. She knows what she's doing. Not so it's very helpful.	1.0
3	It definitely helps because you do have some contestants that don't know where their hips are located or how to move their hips. That's when someone does have body awareness. You're like, okay, we will get to this place the other people you're like, I'm not sure. Yes it is. That's really what it is and Dent Disney night I think is going to be good for them.	1.0
1	Oh my God. I cannot wait for you guys to see it.	1.0
3	Yes, and I think it's contemporary. They have contemporary jazz. It was on the present released its on the press release so I can actually it's Jazz. Yeah. I was like you forgot contemporary jazz But it's been released by ABC. So you're not in trouble. I'm here to tell you that we will not be getting phone calls. It's out there on Twitter. In fact, it's in my feet. If you guys want to see the full press release of what is happening.	1.0

3	Yeah. I was like Brandon said that you guys were going tomorrow and Thursday.	1.0
1	I don't remember what day of the week. I'm in. Sorry.	-1.0
3	It's not the same that you goes. What do you say like today's Tuesday? Because we go tomorrow.	-1.0
1	Yeah, so we go tomorrow and then we stay there and then we're there Thursday, I think so. It's going to be a little bit stressful. They're not going to have as much time together as they usually would but she can be fine.	1.0
3	I think she's going to be totally fine with jazz because she can handle that type of style and she just needs to trust herself because she's picking up the choreo. It seems pretty quickly.	0.0
1	Yeah, I'm gonna be so good. You know it. I don't know about that. I'm excited. I'm happy to see that we did it in our living room yesterday. It looked great.	1.0
3	But in between the show or last night Monday night after the show we had to do the choreo were like already starting to brainstorm.	0.0
1	And of course he did like his research and we had some help and like looking up some videos and stuff like that.	1.0
3	So hopefully you get the concept of everything that's good. Let's talk a little bit about Derek Hough because I'm sure let's talk about Derek because obviously he's had a huge history on Dancing With the Stars but Working with him really started with World of Dance where he was a judge for you. Do you think that he saw you and you know Pasha dance and it probably was thinking I want to work with these two at some point in the future.	1.0
1	Did he ever tell you that or share that with you know, honestly, like I just remember on the show because there's just so many people in the show and I can't blame him like he sees so many act today and like, oh the qualifiers are there laws overwhelming. Yeah. It's so overwhelming, so I'm not Expecting him to like remember every performance we do or everyone does but I do remember on the show. He did say that what he called me called me a good zeiger a tiger mix with a gazelle.	0.0
3	Gazella. Yeah, I guess I guess I think time a geiger I think it was a good idea.	1.0
1	I don't know. It's one of its what I thought. Oh, I think it was like a gazelle entire. Yes, that kind of thing. So yes, I remember that and then actually I think it was Shirley Ballas who? He came to for like a girl he needed a girl for his music video for natural. You're his friend was like doing the rendition for him and stuff. So he's like, do you have like some kickass girl? Can I say you can take you got your good girl, you're fine saying kick ass, and there's no problem. So she's like a real contact one. She contacted me and she's like, all right, you have two days to get your act together and ship your stuff to LA and just do this music video because I remember it was right before the international Dance, World Championships.	-1.0

1	So it was like three days before we had to leave to that in like early. I'm not going anywhere. What are you talking about? Its International dancesport Championship, but you listen to surely don't you I did you're supposed to supposed to and then she's like, I don't care you're going I was like, okay. Well, if you say so I went to LA and I saw Derek there and he's like, oh, this is so awesome. Like and I think he remembered me from yeah, that's what he was like, yes, but then we did that music video and it was just so successful like we had so many views on it and people loved it. They were sharing it for like a year after that. So it was insane. Well, actually it's been it's almost been a it's almost that here.	1.0
3	It's almost a year believe it or not.	0.0
1	So getting shared and talked about so there's a very successful music video. Him and I think we worked really well together on that.	1.0
3	So I'm sure that's probably where he started getting the idea of like tour. Well, he actually asked me that night.	0.0
1	He he did he we did the music video and he's like listen, I think it would be so cool. If you can come out on tour with me and I'm like, I don't really do that. And also I'm competing but most importantly I have a husband who I don't know if I want to leave her that long right? It's like, of course this is going to be the biggest opportunity of my life and to say no no to that would be so stupid.	1.0
3	Like there's just a lot to consider though to you can't just go by Pasha and like that take off.	0.0
1	Yeah, and I was like, I don't know if I can do this without my husband. He's like well bring him with you. I was like, well it's hard because we have all those like students in New York. You can't just leave all our students and you know, so we really had to think about it and Pasha right away said you're going yep and he held down the fort while you were on tour with the your students and did teachers like well, let's not say anything yet, and I told her a red rose. I don't know like we'll see and then once again when he asked me I was like, all right. Well, let's do this like will do the tour and so super fun.	1.0
3	Oh my God you so your opened up to all the Derek Hough fans who are incredibly supportive. So supportive go to multiple shows do the meet and greets over and over again. He really has an incredible fan base. Yeah, what did you witness? Because one thing I love about Derrick is that that show was on him it was on him to deliver every night it on him to deliver incredible speeches, you know beyond even if he wasn't feeling well he is dynamite at that.	1.0
1	I don't know if he's human because he was super hero. He was for how long was the show two hours and he was saying dancing talking playing instrument and this is all live it was not fake. Like this is all real stuff. He was it's like you can't fake that kind of stuff, you know, and he was just on stage non-stop. His quick changes were literally like 15 seconds. Wow, it was insane. Like he's just I don't know what he's made out of but that guy is so energetic and he's just so talented and being his partner on tour was actually the coolest experience ever and his fans were so supportive. And what I really liked about him was the fact that he took the time out of his day. He came out of his trailer signed everybody's autograph talk to people so he wasn't kind of like, all right. Thanks guys. Bye he was like, right so involved with his fans and that's so refreshing. Rushing to see and but then again like he treated us like royalty. He got us like spa days and massages to make sure our bodies were okay.	-1.0
3	He took us to like he treated us to dinners and just things he hadn't have to do I was laughing at I don't think everyone knows this but that day that I did the back-to-back-to-back. I talked to all of the dancers. They're all on Dance Network TV if you're looking for the articles, but every single one of you mentioned he got us the Thera gun and he did	0.0
1	Exhaust foam roller.	0.0
3	Oh, like sure I Brady. Oh, you got the fancy one. I was so fancy. Like he was just so good about it.	1.0
1	He just any little bruise on my body. He's like, oh my God, let me get you ice. Like just the nicest person, you know, like sweet and being that that was my first tour. It was just so blown away like the way he was taking care of not just his cast but like people behind the scenes as well.	1.0
3	He was just crew positions.	0.0
1	Yeah, just just overall he was just taking	1.0
3	Care of every single person making sure he there were okay and that's important too because he is a leader this his name is on this tour and you set the tone as a leader and if you come in there with an attitude it trickles down and then it's contagious and everyone's feeling bad.	1.0
1	But if you're setting an amazing example, yeah, you guys will never forget that tour and even if there was like some tension between choreographers or if something wasn't working and everyone was getting like kind of frustrated. How come I can't get this stuff red wherever he went into the room and right away. His presence just makes Feel like I got this like he's just such a positive person. So it was it was just great like no matter what or how you felt when he entered the room. You just knew everything was going to be okay and you can get through this.	1.0
3	We had JJ here TJ Jackson by a few weeks ago. He's one of my favorites, but I said I said this to him and I'll pass this on to you when I saw the tour in Los Angeles you guys were at the tail end of the tour oftentimes when you see the tail end of a tour everyone's tired and injured. Heard things don't look as sharp as it did 30 cities ago or anything else like that. You guys were so clean and sharp and looking like it was one week into the tour. I was so impressed with that.	1.0
1	It was I mean, we did definitely clean up a lot and what I liked about the tour as well as we didn't get too comfortable. So every like two weeks we would try to take well actually every night we would take one dance and we would Like that one dance to make sure okay. Are we on sorry. I was in the right spot. Are we on our marks? All right. Let's try to make this better. So every single night we'd have one dance we'd focus on so that that night it would be a good like a good quality number with a right positions and makes you like make sure it's clean. So I think because of that it really helped towards the middle and end of the tour to stay clean because we did try and perfect the dances one at a time instead of like kind of Try to do everything will open the whole show doesn't necessarily work. No, so dedicating one day to one dance really really truly helped a lot. And I think that's that was the key.	1.0
3	Yeah, it made a huge difference because I go and see most of the dance shows and Los Angeles is almost always one of the last tour dates.	1.0
1	So I get to see with fresh eyes of like, okay, it was stores hurting or this tour is doing great you guys were on point and I think it was like, Because we had like 6 shows one day break to shows one day break 3 shows what it was like always different every week was different. Sometimes we had like two days off in between but I remember the LA show. I think it was like our fifth show that week already. So we're so tired, but we're so excited because we knew so many people in the audience and there were going to be so many celebrities and famous choreographers and we're like everybody we cannot mess up because this is going to be the best show in that. The reaction from the audience was so cool. Like it's just a great show it gave them really.	1.0
3	Yeah, it was fun to be at the Orpheum because it was jam-packed. It was a lot of familiar faces like intermission was fine because you're like look everyone's here from time.	1.0
1	You think in World of Dance and dancing with the stars and it was intimidating to like knowing how many important people everyone was important there.	-1.0
3	Literally that hole right whether there are a fan or whether they're krog refer. Yeah.	1.0
1	It was like the top of the top of the top people were there. So you're like, oh my God if I mess up everyone's gonna see it. We're stressing but I think because we like we're just having such a good time on stage. I don't know if you guys if you watch the show, we were like screaming at each other and like trying to pump each other up during the show.	-1.0
3	Yeah, like playing games on stage making sure like everyone is still in a great mood present and keep that thing in it because it is that's the other thing too when you do a long tour and people don't realize this unless they've been on tour there are times where you start zoning out and you have to stay present because this is the first time most likely that this	1.0
1	audience is seeing it and you want to give them the same show that you guys kicked off a month before two months before and it was great because the people in the show were so great and it was such a small cast. I think it was only eight of us all together including Derek. So it was such a good intimate cast that it felt like such a small little family traveling America together. It was so cool. It was just always uplifting. We never had drama like it was just always super that's helpful to Super positive. Yeah.	1.0
3	Nah I think drama having a good solid case. There's no you know what Derek wouldn't put up with the drama. Yeah. That's right. It would be like we gotta nip this in the bud absolute now. Yeah, and I wouldn't want to be the one that's on tour causing the drama because Derek will be like, yeah, there's eight of us like definitely yeah drama. It was great. That's so good tour. Obviously team nappytabs was sort of organizing everything behind the scenes you worked with a lot of fantastic where ographers some from World of Dance as well. What was that like is nappytabs. They have their hands on everything these days they are. Working everywhere. They're doing Jennifer Lopez's Super Bowl halftime show.	-1.0
1	I'm not gonna lie. I totally fangirled over them.	1.0
3	Did you when I first met them you met them on world as an season two, right?	0.0
1	I started and that will we don't really get to spend time with him because they were so busy.	0.0
3	Obviously there were like doing the whole show ya they're creative producing directing the show.	0.0
1	So it was like intimidating, but when we met them one-on-one, they're just the sweetest couple and they're just like the ultimate definition of couple goals there. So in love and their sound is the cutest thing in the world and in is adorable.	1.0
3	He's very precocious. He's so smart.	1.0
1	He was always like like playing and doing his thing but nappytabs were just so cool to work with they were very positive always positive made sure that you got if you didn't get it, they would always explain them. Like just just the most amazing people so cool to work with them.	1.0
3	I always think it's interesting to and you know, this is who Derek is also choosing to help, you know, creative direct to show Again, similar type of leadership quality so I've got to imagine like working underneath that tons of great Showbiz lessons right there for sure.	1.0
1	And the way they work together was great because if Derek didn't like something or he wanted to change something there were always on like on the same team. It was nice to see a whole team of people work together. There was again no drama. It was just like getting shit done.	1.0
3	Yes, get it get it get it done. It was like just all right.	1.0
1	We have this amount of time we need to do this this that and the other And they work together. They made sure they put on a good show and it was out the door we went so so good was just a good experience. Yeah, the way they work together was great.	1.0
3	I'm glad to hear that everyone that works at to not be tops. They have they're so funny to they are and not I love that. They're mentoring so many people to you see a lot of people from World of Dance go and work as there supervising choreographers or even just dance Captain's they're really bringing up a whole other generation behind them to yeah. Just wonderful to see you know, I I know that we have a couple of fan questions while I pull these up. I just want to remind you guys that we are on iTunes as well. I know some of you are watching on video, but if you could take the time to not only subscribe to to the point, we would love for you guys to give us five stars and give us a great review because it helps with exposure bringing people like Daniela into the studio. We love having mad but we love giving more visibility to dance which I always think is so important especially with are so many great dance shows. Going on. Okay. We had a lot of people submit questions. No, but they're good. These are all good question people were really excited because I have if you guys want to join the Facebook group dance dish with KB come and join us over there. We talk Dance all the time. We talk every show World of Dance. So You Think You Can Dance that's all that's what the stars and they submitted questions and all right some of these we have answered. Okay. I kind of like this one. This one's from Zoey she want to No, how do you think you will be different from other Pros on the show Once you get a celebrity partner, have you thought about what you would be like with a with a celebrity contestant because I'm so straight forward.	1.0
1	I feel like I don't take myself too. Seriously, which is a good thing, you know, so it's there's no I mean, okay. So basically I'm fresh off the competition floor, right? And with that being said, I still feel like I'm practicing my technique and I Teach for a living So and I've had people who've never danced before a day in their life. They have regular office jobs and they just come to me because they want to just just Unleash the Beast with it, you know, so I do have a lot of like gentleman who come in who want to learn how to properly ballroom dance because they want to surprise your wives. That's so sweet and they end up staying and actually taking their wives to the lessons and improving. So I feel like I have so much experience with people who have never danced before and Making them into really beautiful dancers or into just a dancer when you think you can't you know, so I already have that experience. But it I would love to really get to show my personality as well because I do love meeting new people and seeing how like we can work together and stuff like that. So definitely it would have definitely been fun to work with a celebrity partner season 29.	1.0
3	Let's put this over season 29, you know, maybe that's celebrities. Sweeten for you a year from now you don't talking about your Ballroom competition days. Are you guys like you've retired is it just on the back burner for now? Where do you guys think you are in terms of competing?	0.0
1	We don't want to say retired because I feel like that's shuts the door. Yeah. I don't want to be finished dancing. Like that's not a thing for me. I don't want to finish my career in that. I feel like you never know what happens again. Like you have to trust the process and let's say you have like a great. Petition in the back of your hand just like hmm. Maybe I can compete next weekend or something that you know, like why you're staying with your Technique you want to make sure that you're ready ready for anything and maybe I don't want to compete necessarily but I definitely want to continue doing shows with Basha because I do love dancing with him and retiring means I don't get to dance with him anymore, you know, so I don't want to think of it like that and I want to think of it just I'm trying something new. I'm still the same dancer. I just have a new audience. That's it. You know, I don't want to finish it.	1.0
3	We don't have to like retiree. I never tiring we're not I just was thinking like on the competition Circuit of you close orbit.	-1.0
1	I think right now it's just we're so focused on this and we want to really make this our goal and we want to do the best that we can possibly do with this show. And for now, we're not competing because we do your here we want to put all our time love effort everything into this and if we're going to scatter ourselves, it's not going to be good for anything.	1.0
3	So and you're going out on the Dancing with the Stars tour, correct? Yeah. Pasha is not as of right now as of now, he's not okay, but hopefully but maybe something will change.	1.0
1	Is he planning on heading back to New York and and teaching and I don't know if he doesn't If he if things don't work out and if he doesn't do the tour, I think he's probably going to go and just do the best that you can teaching and improving himself because you still want to take lessons.	0.0
3	You still want to guys are young to I like we're not retiring you off, but I think he wants.	0.0
1	Travel and just teach and again we have so many kids. We like take care of and they're Ballroom career and and a lot of like people even seniors we have actually the three-time 10 dance senior championships you do do and they live in Albany New York. So under the sweetest people ever they have like this whole club called Albany dancesport club and the names were Paul and Louise Giuliano. I love that. They started this whole club and there I don't want to lie. I think he's close close to 70 years old. I think yeah, and there are the three.	1.0
3	We time US Champions national champions why I wanted Mary Wilson to stay longer to because I think being able and it Kate is over, you know fifty but never too late never too late showcasing like if as long as your body is feeling strong and you're feeling good like showcasing that life doesn't end when you get older it can continue on actually they're people who start when they're 50 so good and they make it and they win national championships.	1.0
1	We even have world championships for people like that. We have a Pro-Am hold dancesport committee where The teacher competes with their student and we had we actually had women who came in and they've never done stay in their lives and they've been winning like World Pro-Am championships and it's amazing to watch it's so tiring. Yeah, and I love that about Ballroom because not every style of dance has that and I feel like there's a lot of closed doors when it comes to that but in Ballroom, you do have the chance to just go and compete with your student and make them the best they can bought like possibly feel and look and maybe when some titles absolutely like that. Yeah, I like that. Let's see we talked about Derek.	1.0
3	Let's see. Oh, this is kind of interesting. What was it like working with Lauren Adams She because it was at this was cut. This is Ballroom was new to her, right?	1.0
1	Yeah, actually the way we ran into her. Okay. So basically she was taking lessons with Shirley Ballas while we brought her in so we usually like to bring her in like book her up. Lessons so she actually was having a proem lesson with her partner with her professional partner and she was new to it. And she I think she had just won the World Championships and like in syllabus or something like that and she like she was so good and Ballroom. She just started Ballroom. Wow, and she saw some the studio one day and she's like guys we need to do a video together and we're like, all right, you know like didn't think anything about like of it and she's like, right so James Bay is coming out. His new single Let it go Let it go Let it go Let it go Let it go.	1.0
3	I know that kind of thing, but it is let it go let it go.	0.0
1	So she's like I'm actually entering the contest and I would love to submit a video of YouTube even though it's like a contemporary thing. I just want to do I want to do a ballroom because I feel like it should be a ballroom Rumba song. So we're like, all right, let's do it, you know nothing to lose its just try it and we take that video and I'm like a think it was Ripley greater like one of the New York City very famous studios in New York City and we recorded in Ripley Greer and literally like it was just I think she could she like, mr. Deadline or something like this and she still submitted it with it, like whether it was a desert might as well submitted it and we had like 2 million views on it. Literally we're in like wow practice out father. It is real. I can practice outfits sweating like barely any makeup barely did my hair. Are like showed up danced our Rumba together and it was like 2 million views on YouTube. It was just insanity and then she's like, okay this worked.	1.0

3	And I'm obsessed with brick and hair like brick wall is so good. And she's like, let's just do it.	0.0
1	Let's I'm going to direct another video for you. Let's do something cool. And that's when she's like how about you show us a different sites of Ballroom something in like jeans and like ripped jeans and t-shirts and stuff like that and we're like that's a really cool concept. So we filmed that we had another like I don't remember how many of you is exactly it had but it was so successful and till this day people are again are sharing it and talking about it and tagging me in videos and a lot of people actually started being our fans from that video.	1.0
3	Isn't that funny you think like oh Dancing with the Stars or world of dances The Source, but no, it's Lauren Adams directed this video that went viral, you know, I believable. So Cara thanked you for that question because yeah, obviously it came right back around.	1.0
1	She actually opened a lot of doors for us when it comes to those videos. Isn't that interesting World of Dance actually contacted us because of that video see yes all it's so funny when you start like putting together when you look at people	1.0
3	We're using like the Stepping Stones like the Lauren Adams to the World of Dance the Derek Hough thwarted Dancing with the Stars.	0.0
1	It's amazing.	1.0
3	It's unbeliev really is unbelievable. Honestly, I like this question to and Chantal asked who are your favorite dancers and choreographers who inspire you?	1.0
1	Okay deaf, and Alice is surely now. Yeah, sounds like Shirley, but to be honest I get inspired a lot from Contemporary videos or like hip-hop so something that's not Ballroom sometimes of course, like if I'm doing a ballroom practice or something, I'll look at like that. So my favorite girls and I'll just like watch them and see the way they move their bodies and get inspired but a lot of my inspiration comes from hip hop dancers and especially people like his funny but like, you know, Casey rice. Yeah, I know keys right here comes Shawn and Casey are she has no idea who I am, but it's okay, but I'm a put it out there in love with the way. She's connected to her body and especially people like I don't really know her like Jade Jade Chenoweth. Yeah, I'm not really familiar with her. But her work is just I love the way. she's like she's committed into what she does wrong and Fierce and Powerful years people like that really inspire me people like Beyonce when she releases those videos and she has like her hair flying like that also inspires me like her Persona inspires me and I want to be like that like that kind of girl in that Ballroom field because a lot of times like you don't really see ballroom dancers out there, you know and feel like I want to inspire people the way these icons Inspire us, you know, like people like I like that Fela or Beyonce.	1.0
3	Yes, and the ballroom world has room for that too. I think that's kind of you know, you think this is what Ballroom is now Ballroom can be many many different things different personalities. Yeah. Oh, I like that too. It's a weightless. CR ahead said, let's see this way. I think is interesting. So final question how has the ballroom circuit and Since shaped you as the dancer you are today.	1.0
1	It has given me everything. I know like I'm just so thankful. I stayed in it for so long because he gave me the technique it showed me how to connect my body properly because everything is done from your Center in Ballroom. All the strength comes from your legs and your Center and hopefully it resonates through your face and through your upper body, you know, so it gave me definitely that strength and connections inside my body. So when I do something that's outside Ballroom, I still feel like I'm able to be connected and look kind of okay fish but it definitely gave me discipline. So on it's good to plan and my body and going through pain, you know and and discomfort and sometimes when you feel like wow, I feel so good today and you look at the video like what is that bad and then like some competitions I walk off the floor and I'm like how like that was. The worst dancing I've ever done in my life and we watched the video with her coach and she's like this is probably one of your best competitions ever, huh? So it always taught me like don't trust your like the interview boy.	1.0
