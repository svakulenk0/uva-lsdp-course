No! No! No! No! No!
- No! No! No! No! No!
- Die!
Colonel Redding.
Now there's a piece of work.
I can't believe he's having us
wire up this hellhole.
What's he expecting to find down there?
Ghosts of old miners?
All right.
You got everybody?
Number one's dead.
How about now?
Good there.
They're dead, too.
Hold on.
What the hell?
I got a shitload of false readings.
Stand by.
Again?
What's going on here?
Damn it.
We just lost our feed.
I'll go check the main junction.
Spooky down there, isn't it? We're
the first ones in there since the 50s.
Oh, fuck!
It's history.
Our friends the rats again.
They love the taste of the insulation.
All right, I'll call base, should be able
to get a backup here in an hour or so.
Shit.
Dr. Wilson, have you seen Foster?
Calibrating the infrared sensor
up top the mountain.
- Dumb sons-a-bitches.
- Sorry, Colonel Redding.
Guys aren't supposed to be here
without a goddamn escort!
Wilson.
Wilson?
Where are these guys?
Han, do you read me?
It's Foster.
Hi.
Are you lost?
My name is Dr. Foster.
Do you have a name?
- Roonawee.
- Roonwee?
- Roonawee!
- Run away?
Foster?
Foster!
Now where are you?
Come on.
Come out of your holes.
Come on, you cocksucker
motherfucker sons-a-bitches!
Foster!
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.
Go! Go!
Move out! Move out! Go!
- Keep moving! Keep mo...
- Go!
Oh, shit!
- Take cover!
- Come on, Crank!
- Spitter!
- Leave it!
I got to get my helmet.
Spitter, forget your fucking helmet!
Get back here!
Die!
America's mothers suck cocks!
- What the fuck did you say?
- Your American mothers suck cocks.
Fuck you!
America number one, bitch!
Crank, no!
- Crank!
- Let's move, pussies!
Crank, you dumb motherfucker!
Don't freak out!
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Get back!
I know what to do,
get out of the way.
- Give him some cover!
- I got this! I got this!
You get out!
This is fortress of Allah!
Come on.
Napoleon, get the door!
- Get the door, man!
- What? I can't hear you.
- Get the fucking door!
- Door!
This is the mother of all doors!
Fall back!
- Shit! Take cover!
- Run!
Shit.
You killed my babies!
Oh, no!
You killed my babies!
You killed my babies!
Watch out.
Watch her!
- We didn't mean to.
- No, Napoleon!
Kaboom.
Oh, you're dead.
Idiot.
A stunning display of individual
and group stupidity!
I'm in fucking awe!
Cole!
Never leave cover to retrieve your helmet!
You won't have a head
to put it on anyway!
Johnson, do not drop your weapon
to protect your ears.
You are better off deaf than dead.
Medina, since you
are not Rambo resurrected...
...do not charge while your head
is securely up your ass.
And you, Napoleon.
It's Napoli, Sarge.
You're quite the killer, aren't you?
Napoleon?
Almost got your whole squad
blown to hell in six seconds.
That's a mighty impressive body count
for somebody who's against the war.
- What?
- Oh, yeah, your brother didn't tell you?
Pretty mouth here's got himself
a bumper sticker.
It says "Conversation, not confrontation".
What's up with that shit?
You against the war, Doonesbury?
Not all war, Sarge. I just think
that the President lies too much.
All presidents lie, asshole!
That's their fucking job.
Yes, sir.
No president has told the truth since
Truman. And do you know what he said?
- No, Sarge.
- He said that the buck stops here.
Now you have all failed combat
and are therefore officially dead.
Congratu-fucking-lations!
Fall in at that deuce-and-a-half
with all gear.
We will deploy to the
Agave Ridge rifle range.
There you can complete your failure
of these exercises...
...by blowing each
others' dead heads off.
And on our way, we're stopping
at Sector 16...
...to deliver equipment to scientists who
are working there.
This is a top secret area, so do not
wander off or talk to anybody.
Now get your sorry rookie butts
in the back of that truck! Now!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go, Spitter. If I had some steak
on a string, you'd move real fast!
Jesus, how big is this place?
It's about 1300 square miles.
They used to test nuclear weapons here.
Well, isn't it radioactive then?
Not according to the Army.
Fuck.
Well, maybe I should thank Napoleon.
If we're all officially dead, like Sarge
said, I won't be tried for war crimes.
The killing of innocent mannequins
is serious shit.
Where I come from it's never
good to be dead.
Ah, Crank, you're taking all the fun
out of the afterlife.
- Shove the afterlife up your ass.
- That's cold, man.
Clyde, huh?
Made the same mistake when I was a kid.
So is Clyde still your dude?
Stump. That's her son.
He's, like, four years old.
That is so fucked up.
One good thing about being dead.
Wouldn't have to listen to your bullshit.
That's all there is out here.
It's a bunch of bullshit.
This bullshit's got a crazy past.
You know they used to use this
as a test ground for A-bombs?
"You guys know this used to be a
test ground for A-bombs!"
Who the fuck asked you?
Peace ass shit boy!
Oh, right. I'm sorry. I forgot
I was dealing with Rambo resurrected.
You can Rambo resurrect my balls, bitch.
What, you wanna die young, cabrón?
Huh? Huh?
I'll kill you right now.
Crank!
I killed somebody once.
It was easy.
That's why it's so dangerous.
I don't fucking like that guy.
Well, I don't like being out here having
to put up with you, but I deal with it.
So deal with it.
Thanks.
Don't mind Crank.
He's just a cranky motherfucker.
They're so top secret,
they're invisible, huh?
You got that right.
Oh, leg's asleep.
- Dick's asleep!
- You wanna wake it up?
Hey, you two, cut the bullshit.
Off-load that crate. Put it in the tent!
Spitter, get me base.
National Guard Yankee Five Niner
calling Yuma Flats Base, over.
National Guard Yankee Five Niner
calling Yuma Flats Base, over.
Nothing, sir.
It's the hills.
Keep trying.
National Guard Yankee Five Niner
to Yuma Flats Base, over.
Hello.
- Private Crackhead.
- Sarge.
See if you can find Colonel Redding. He's
supposed to be the security over here.
See these cables?
They run into that old bunker over there.
Check it out.
Watch your step.
Yes, sir, Sergeant.
Private Mickey Mouse,
see if you can find some gas.
There's got to be some
cans around here somewhere.
Yes, Sergeant.
Napoleon!
Where the fuck are you going?
- I was just going to use the facilities.
- Are you fucking kidding me?
You are in Mountain Assault training.
There are no Port-a-Potties in Kandahar.
You'll take your dumps behind the cactus
with the scorpions. Understand me?
- What do I use for t. p., sir?
- Use your fucking hand.
Yes, Sarge.
Yo!
Colonel Redding?
Shit!
Stupid bats!
No gas, sir, but I found this.
Satellite phone. Must have been
how they contacted base.
- I don't think it's working.
- Damn, somebody's got a temper.
Oh, mine's all buttoned up, Sarge.
Nobody's home.
- Whose radio is that?
- Must be one of theirs.
Wilson. Han.
Are you there?
Hello.
This is Sergeant Jeffrey Millstone
of the U.S. National Guard.
Who is this,
and what's your position?
Are you in distress?
Fuck. Spitter, what's the range
on these things?
Couple miles.
Line of sight.
Sarge!
Looks like a signal mirror.
We're on a search and rescue mission.
- That's right we are!
- Shut the fuck up!
I said search and rescue,
not fucking spring break.
I want you back here with weapons
and gear for a climbing assault in five.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir, Sarge.
Do you think it's a good idea going up
there without contacting headquarters?
Do you like fucking with me, Napoleon?
I think you do.
You know what?
You're officially in charge
of guarding the latrine...
...not using it, but guarding it.
I want you to stand on one leg and
hold your rifle over your fucking head...
...and make sure that no one
steals or molests that Port-a-Potty.
Or I will have your Gomer Pyle
ass court-martialed immediately.
Do you understand what I am saying
to you? Do you understand me!?
Yeah, I'll go.
I just think that it's a bad idea.
- Go and guard that fucking latrine, now!
- Sir, yes, sir!
- Live ammo or blanks?
- One live mag each weapon. It's heavier.
Flashlights and hydration packs, too. The
more weight, the better for you clowns.
You're halfway through your training and
you look like a bunch of raw recruits.
You're a disgrace
to the U.S. National Guard...
...and wouldn't last five minutes
in combat!
One leg, Gomer Pyle!
The rest of you...
...get your asses up that hill and wipe
those silly smiles off your faces, now!
Let's move!
One leg, Pyle! One leg.
- Company halt! Johnson!
- Sir?
You stay here.
Spitter's coming with us. Get on the
main radio and try to raise somebody.
If you can get through to a medvac,
the guy'll have a hell of a better chance.
Now move.
Yes, Sarge.
Don't forget to write.
Get going! Turn around!
One leg!
- When I grew up my momma said
- When I grew up my momma said
That's what happens
when you miss the prom"
One leg, Gomer Pyle!
Mayday, mayday. This is
the National Guard Yankee Five Niner...
...calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medvac, over.
Hello?
Shit.
Mayday, mayday. This is the
National Guard Yankee Five Niner...
...calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medvac, over.
What the hell are scientists doing
way the hell out here?
There's nothing but rocks
and rattlesnakes.
Army business, dumbass.
And definitely none of your business.
- But, Sarge, I am in the army.
- Which gives you the right...
...to shut the fuck up.
- Okay, I'll just shut the fuck up then.
How many people
are supposed to be here?
I have no idea.
Maybe we can ask him up there.
What are we supposed to do
when we find this dude?
That depends on how bad he is. We wait
for a medvac or hump him down by hand.
I know I'm not supposed to talk,
Sarge, but I hope he...
- Shit, man!
- Help!
I got you!
Come on. Pull him up.
I got you, Mickey!
Oh, shit!
Hello.
- Shit.
- You saved my life, Sarge.
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.
- How far down does that thing go?
- China?
Could be a hundred feet deep,
a hundred years old.
Just waiting to suck your ass in.
So keep your eyes open.
There's a lot of old mines around here.
How's your ankle, Mickey?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Let's go.
- We cannot afford to slow down.
- Hey, come on, Sarge. Let's go.
- Head back to base camp.
- Come on, Sarge.
Mick, back to camp. Now.
That's an order.
What the fuck is everybody looking at?
Let's keep moving.
Screw it.
Duty calls.
Mayday, mayday, this is the
National Guard Yankee Five Niner...
...calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medvac, over.
Mayday, mayday, this is the National
Guard Yankee Five Niner...
...calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medvac, over.
Oh, fuck! Fuck!
- What?
- There's a hand in the shitter!
- What?
- Check it out!
Fucking...
There's nobody in there.
Down there.
- Who was that guy?
- Shitman the barbarian, I have no idea!
Help me!
- Oh, man.
- Oh, God.
I can't tell one rock from another.
It was between those three.
Seems like that's the only way up.
Right there.
- That ain't so bad.
- No, man.
Not so bad at all.
If you're a fucking squirrel.
What's with all these cuts?
I don't know.
Who did this to you?
They're here.
Who's they?
None of the cuts were that deep.
- Massive infection.
- What?
Shit stinks because
it's full of pathogens.
Whoever did this to him,
wanted him to die slowly.
What kind of person
could do that to someone?
I honestly don't know.
Let's go, Delmar.
There you go.
Pick your spots!
Find the creases.
You got it. You got it.
Keep going, soldier.
There you go.
That's what I'm talking about, Delmar!
All right! All right!
All right!
Spider-Man.
You are officially a bad motherfucker.
Stump, you're up next.
The rest of you get your asses ready!
All right, Stump, let's go.
Let's get it going.
Take your time
but pick your spots, Stump.
- Asshole!
- Easy. Sarge says we're moving out.
Well, make some noise next time
you come up behind me!
Yeah, whatever.
I'm just the messenger.
Chicks, man.
Hello. Hello, over.
Hello! Hello, over.
Can you get through to them?
Radio sucks.
Hello! Sarge? Anybody?
Holy shit!
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no, no, no, no!
- God.
- Shit!
What are you doing?
Fuck!
- What?
- Where's your rifle?
Oh, God. It's gone.
Oh, God!
- Let's just get up there.
- No, we're not going up that hill.
I'm not hiding down here and waiting
for them to come down.
What? You scared?
It's about not making idiotic
and possibly fatal decisions.
Right, forgot who I was speaking to.
The same genius who got his
whole squad blown to hell.
Didn't you hear what he said?
Someone is here.
You wanna die like him?
Hello, Sarge?
Hello, Sarge!
Hello? Sarge? Anyone?
Can anybody out there read me?
- Napoleon!
- What?
I don't know...
Amber!
Napoleon!
I hit him?
Mickey! Mickey!
Hey, who was that?
Mickey, something's going on.
Oh, God. Are you all right?
Yeah, I just twisted my ankle.
Hold on!
Holy shit! Fuck!
Hold on!
Hold on, I got you.
- Shit!
- Hold on, I got you!
Shoot the fucker! Shoot him!
- Shoot him!
- I can't see in there!
I don't have a shot!
Fucking help me, man!
Goddamn it, I don't...
Fuck! Don't let go!
Don't let go!
Mickey!
Mickey!
Mickey!
Man, this is some bullshit.
What?
Thought I heard something.
A shot.
This is a military base.
People are shooting all over the place.
I think it came from camp. Has anybody
checked in with Amber recently?
Mickey's down there by now.
You know, he's got her in a tent...
...and they're doing a whole other
kind of training. Know what I mean?
- Sarge, up there.
- I see it!
Another one.
You two!
Get your asses up here!
Come on.
Hello!
Hello!
Oh, no.
The red and black high-top Forces.
What? And it's my size too?
What the fuck is it doing way up here?
Now, if we could only find
the other one we'd be in business.
Sarge! Over here!
Sarge!
Fuck is in his head?
- Private Crackhead? Fish it out.
- Shit.
"Dr. Paul Foster,
Department of Defense. "
Looks like we found one of our scientists.
Lock and load.
This isn't supposed to happen
on an army base.
- We're in a U.S. Military facility.
- The size of Rhode Island.
If some asshole wants to go nuts,
this is a damn good place to do it.
Spitter, get Amber on the radio.
Stark nine, stark nine. Amber,
this is Spitter. You read me? Over.
Stark nine, stark nine.
Amber, this is Spitter. Read me? Over.
There's too much interference.
Sarge, we should go back down there.
Amber's fine.
She's got Mick and Napoleon.
- Help me.
- That their radio? Let me have it.
Colonel Redding, is this you?
Hello, can you hear me?
- That wasn't the same voice as before.
- Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.
But if somebody's hurt,
we're gonna help him.
And if somebody is fucking with us,
we're gonna find out who it is.
I've told you before,
this isn't spring break.
One way or the other, lives are at stake.
That's how it is.
Crank, Spitter, you stay with me on lead.
Missy, Stump, Delmar...
...you bring up the rear. Watch our backs.
Stay alert, and stay alive.
Let's move.
You hear something?
I don't know. Maybe a bird?
- Keep your eyes open.
- Okay.
What the fuck was that?
Shit!
What the fu...
No! Sarge!
D!
Spitter! Fuck!
Oh, fuck, man. Sarge!
That was Spit, man.
- Sarge!
- I didn't mean to do that!
Sarge!
You hurt? You hurt?
- I didn't mean to do that.
- Do what?
Sarge!
What do we do?
Go get me the medi-pack.
D! Medi-pack!
Bring it over here!
Fuck, man.
What happened?
I swear, this dude just popped out of
nowhere and he stabbed Spit in the back.
Fuck, man, I didn't mean to. Fuck,
man, is he okay? Is he okay? Fuck!
Sarge?
Sarge? Come on, breathe.
Breathe, Sarge.
Sarge, stay with us.
What do we need?
What do you need?
Crank?!
Missy, what do you need?
Crank?! Crank?!
Tell them, man, tell them.
It was an accident.
It was a fucking accident.
They're fucking with us.
These guys are smart.
Amber?
Where's Mickey?
Watch between the rocks.
Under your feet, too.
That's how they got Mickey?
- That's how they did it.
- God.
What is it?
What do you see, Delmar?
It's nothing.
We're almost there.
All right, guys.
Let's rig a line and get Sarge down.
I'm going down with him.
Sorry, Spit, I don't know how
to rig for a two-man.
- Yeah, me either, man.
- I can do it.
All right.
All right, let's make it happen.
- You need two, right?
- Yeah.
Oh, and a couple of those carabineers.
Prop him up. Prop him up.
You sure you know what you're doing?
- Double bowline. Right knot for the job.
- You sure about that?
- I was an Eagle Scout.
- It better fucking hold.
Come on, Spit, let's do it.
You ready? All right.
I'm sorry, Spitter.
It's the only way. If he's loose,
he'll fall out of his harness.
Okay?
Okay, man.
Easy. Go easy.
- Okay.
- You got it, Spitter.
All right, man, plant your feet.
Take it easy.
Right there, Spitter. You got it.
Plant-plant your feet, man.
- You're doing good, Spitter.
- Little more. Little more.
Napoleon, get your thumb out
of your ass and help us out!
You feel comfortable? You looking
good, man. Keep it right there.
- Slow it down a little bit.
- Slow down, I'm about to lose visual.
Keep it slow, Spitter.
Y'all slow down. Slow down.
Spitter! Spitter! Spit!
- What happened?
- Shit.
What happened?
What happened?
He's fucking dead, man.
- What the fuck happened?
- He's fucking dead.
Your fucking knot didn't hold,
you lying faggot!
- The rope must've broke.
- The rope didn't break.
- Exactly.
- It was cut.
Oh, man, we're getting picked off
one by one here.
Oh, you motherfuckers!
You motherfuckers are dead!
You hear me?!
Dead!
Shit.
Where are the ropes?
Who's got the rest of the ropes?
I put them up there.
They're gone.
They're not here.
We can't get down without the ropes.
Who the hell is doing all
of this fucking bullshit to us?
Whoever these fuckers are,
they want us dead.
No, that's where they want us.
Thinking we got no chance.
We're gonna get out of this together.
Let's think about that.
- So how do we get down?
- There's got to be a way.
They got up here.
We'll take the same way down.
Watch your step.
It's a long way down.
Damn!
- You're not gonna like this.
- What?
Fuck, man!
Another dead end!
No way we're getting down
without ropes. I told you!
We go back and find another way.
Oh, shit.
D, why the fuck are we moving
towards the weird noises?
- Just shut the hell up.
- You shut the hell up. This is bullshit.
D!
Shit.
Go ahead and shoot.
- Let's get some first aid.
- Coming up.
Napoleon, let's watch our backs.
Colonel Redding?
Just hang on, sir, okay?
We're gonna get you out of here.
Where's your C. O?
Where's your Commanding Officer?
We lost him.
Better let me see those wounds, sir.
You don't have a fucking clue!
Jesus.
Shit!
Sir, if you know something
we should know, now's the time.
I just needed a little proof.
- Proof of what?
- What's going on here, Colonel?
It's not the fucks in caves...
...halfway around the world
that keep me up at night.
Right here in the middle
of our own goddamn base.
People still living in the mines.
They thought they got rid of them,
but I knew they didn't.
You knew about these fuckers?
One or two more nights...
...I could have had them blown back
to the Stone Age.
Tell us what to do, Colonel.
How do we get out of here?
That's a good fucking question.
Isn't it?
You could...
You could go down through the mines.
Except they'd kill you for sure.
All except the girls, you ladies...
...they'll keep you alive for breeding.
Trying to get their numbers back up.
What?
Yeah, whatever, asshole.
How do we get down this hill?
Simple.
No, no, no!
What the fuck?
What the fuck was that, man?
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.
I'm so fucking scared.
We're gonna get through this.
We're gonna make it out of here.
Okay?
You think?
Have to.
I'm the only real family Clyde's got.
Give anything just to smell
his hair again.
You never talk about him.
Work's work.
Family is, I don't know, sacred.
I always tried keeping the two separate.
But I guess that's all bullshit now.
He's beautiful.
Now!
Yeah!
Bitch!
Is he dead?
Fucking A!
Got him.
You all right?
That's the piece of shit
that jumped me back at camp.
I think he killed Mickey, too.
Damn. He's fucking ugly.
Fucking stinks.
He's fucking big, man.
Still, nothing a little hot lead can't fix.
Hot lead?
Listen to you, man.
Yeah, well, it's just one.
How many are left?
Bring them on, man.
- You guys did good.
- Thanks.
Smells like shit.
Where's Missy?
Hey, Missy?
- Missy?
- Shit!
There!
Watch yourselves.
Missy!
Missy!
Hold on, Delmar.
You heard what that dude said.
We should climb down, man.
What are you talking about?
Talking about you and me.
We don't need ropes.
We can get down freestyle, no sweat,
man. Let's just do it.
- What about the rest of us?
- What about Missy?
We can get down fast and you know it.
The rest of you guys just hang tough
and we're gonna bring back some help.
Fuck that!
We stick together. It's the best way.
We separate...
- We're dead.
- You got that right.
Stump.
I'm gonna take my chances, man.
Stump! Stay with us, man.
Come on.
When I get down,
I'm gonna bring back help.
This is stupid, man.
Crank, that is fucking stupid, man.
I'm going back out.
Shit.
You guys ready for this?
We got your back.
It stinks in here.
You see anything?
There's only one way
they could've gone.
Dead end?
Where the fuck are they?
Guys.
Down here.
I can't see shit.
I'll check it out.
Wait for my signal.
- You good?
- Clear.
Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck.
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God!
We got you.
- Get me out!
- You're good. You're fine. It's all right.
Jesus Christ!
You cool, Napoleon?
Yeah, I think so. Jesus.
Where the hell are we?
Next level down.
All right. Okay.
Fuck!
They're just fucking rocks.
They're only fucking rocks.
I'm not gonna let you bastards get me.
Not me. Not today.
This is not gonna happen.
Hey, guys.
There's a breeze.
Shit.
This is where the fuckers hid
to cut the ropes.
We can't just leave them down there.
There's nothing we can do for them now.
Except find Missy
and get the fuck out of here.
Missy's probably dead, too.
You're not doing anybody
any good talking like that.
Come on.
Delmar!
Delmar!
No, help me! Oh, God!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Is it a dead end?
No. No, it goes through.
- How deep is it?
- Let's see.
How many do you think there are?
Who knows? Too many.
- What are you doing?
- I'm saving one for myself.
Do you remember what Crank said?
Dead is never better.
We're gonna get out of here.
I just...
- Amber!
- Napoleon!
- Hang on!
- Shit!
Fuck!
What the hell?!
Shit!
You guys all right?
Amber?!
Napoleon?!
Where's my rifle?
You okay?
- Shit.
- Amber!
You guys all right?
Yeah. We're all right.
- We're gonna find a way down.
- No problem.
Hang on.
Shit.
Napoleon.
What are you doing?
Napoleon!
I thought I heard something.
Shit.
I think that's the level they're on.
You think we can climb
down without gear?
You see that beam? If we can
make it across, we slide down that.
I think I could make that jump.
What are you doing?
Crank. Crank! Wait!
- Crank!
- Fuck! Shit!
Shit!
Delmar!
Hang on!
Thanks.
Let's keep it moving.
Let's go.
No!
Want.
Mama.
Pretty.
Dirty cunt!
Come here.
Mine!
So sweet.
No. Was her. Papa, no.
You give me baby.
- Shit.
- Goddamn it. Come on.
Motherfucker!
Missy!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Shit. It's Stump's headband.
What?
Oh, my God. Oh, shit.
Where is he?
There!
There!
Got you.
Enough!
Kill them all.
Napoleon? We got to go.
He's got a gun. Come on.
Napoleon.
The hatch. Get the hatch.
Get the hatch!
Missy?!
Which way?
You safe here.
Safe.
I'm right behind you.
Let's go.
Goddamn.
What the hell happened here?
Come on, bitch!
Yeah, baby! It's all about volume!
Got to have volume!
It's Crank.
- You okay?
- I'm all right. I'm all right.
Lone Ranger shoulder wound.
Missed the bone completely.
Damn.
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah.
Who you fucking with, huh?
Who you fucking with?
Crank? Crank?
You got any ammo left?
Fuck.
I'm out, too.
Delmar? Your bayonet.
- Crank! Delmar!
- Shit!
Down here.
Oh, shit!
You guys are alive!
What happened to you?
- Oh, shit.
- Delmar, are you all right?
Be a hell of a lot better
when we get out of here.
- Were you shot?
- I'm fine. It's nothing.
You sure?
Shit.
- What the hell is that?
- He's okay.
Are you out of your goddamn mind?
He's one of them!
No, he just saved our lives.
No fear. You come.
Follow me.
Come.
This way.
- You good?
- I'm all right.
Don't worry. I'm all right.
We got to get him out of here.
Missy's not that far.
You heard her screams.
How're we gonna get her out of here
without any goddamn ammo?
We can fight them with rocks
and rifle butts if we have to.
- Who's Rambo resurrected now?
- I just wanna get everyone out of here.
Yeah? Well, tell that to Mickey,
and Spitter, and Stump!
- Crank! Shut the hell up!
- You trust that guy?
He hid us from them.
He didn't give us up.
We don't have any choice.
We have to trust him.
Bullshit!
God knows where he's taking us.
To be honest with you, I'm not sure
God knows anything about this place.
Through here.
Must through here.
Jesus.
Shit.
Holy shit.
Oh, man.
Oh, God.
- Jeez!
- What the fuck?!
- God! Mickey!
- Don't look!
You sick fuck!
You should be shot!
I should kill you!
- Crank!
- What, man?
Why you always try
to shut me down, Delmar, huh?
Don't freak out.
- What the fuck?
- Don't freak out.
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
What the fuck, what? Delmar!
Delmar.
What the fuck, man?
You were hit twice?
Why didn't you tell me?
Don't do this, man.
Don't do this!
Don't do this.
Don't leave me, man.
Don't fucking leave me!
Fuck!
Get me a medi-pack. Napoleon!
Get me a medi-pack. Come on.
Crank.
I'm not gonna leave him.
I'm not gonna leave him.
You sick fuck!
- You're not gonna have him!
- Okay, okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Get us out of here.
Come. Yeah.
I'll get you out of here.
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
I bet this leads outside!
How do I get this fucking door open?
- Come on!
- Hey, would you forget it, Crank?
Would you forget it? It's a blast door.
You're never gonna get it open.
God dammit!
We need to get out of here,
you fucking retard!
- Crank!
- How the fuck do we get out of here?
What about Missy?
Would you get off this shit that she's
alive? Missy is fucking dead! Okay?!
Just like the rest of them.
Just like we're gonna be
if we don't get the fuck out of here!
We are not leaving this place
without her!
Stupid, okay?
How the fuck do we get out
of here, man? Which way is it?!
What's over there?
What's over here?
- I'm going back for her!
- Amber, stay here.
- Guys!
- Amber?
Oh, shit! Guys! Check it out!
Everything we need...
No touch! No touch.
Amber! Please, don't.
I'm begging you.
I'd go back for you.
Amber!
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, shit.
Dynamite. Perfect.
My God.
I'm gonna get out of here after all.
Oh, yeah. Delmar?
We're getting out of here, baby.
What the...
Fuck!
Oh, God. Crank!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Oh, shit. Crank!
Crank?
Crank!
It's Missy!
Let's do it.
Missy's phone.
- What?
- Do you still have Missy's phone?
Wait here.
I can't take it anymore. I can't!
I don't wanna be quiet.
I want out of here. We're gonna die,
don't you get it? We're gonna die!
Which way do we go, Napoleon?
Where?
I can't take it anymore, Napoleon.
I can't!
Genius.
We're gonna die, don't you get it?
We're gonna die!
Jesus Christ.
- Amber!
- You okay? Give me this arm.
- Stay with me.
- It's okay. We got you. We got you.
Where's everybody else?
Get me out of here, please!
- Don't let him touch me again.
- Come on, let's go.
Please.
Don't let him touch me.
- Amber.
- Come on.
- We got you.
- This way.
Napoleon!
- I don't hear him anymore.
- What are you doing?
Let's just get out of here!
Please!
We don't have time...
Come here!
- No!
- Die!
Bitch!
Die!
Napoleon, get up!
Get up!
Napoleon, get up!
Die.
Amber!
Die. Die. Die. Die. Die.
Come on. Come on!
- Get her!
- Missy, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Motherfucker!
Missy! Come on! Missy!
Don't let him get his knife!
- Pull!
- Missy!
Get my leg! Oh, my God!
Let go of her!
Missy! Get something!
Missy!
Oh, God.
