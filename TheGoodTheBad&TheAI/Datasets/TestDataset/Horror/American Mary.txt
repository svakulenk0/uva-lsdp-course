Miss Mason.
Since your listening skills
are so adept,
perhaps you could tell me how many
molecules of oxygen
a molecule of haemoglobin can hold
in the blood for transport.
- Four.
- And haemoglobin is what?
The iron-containing
oxygen-transport metalloprotein
- in the red blood cells of vertebrates.
- Anywhere else?
In the tissues of some invertebrates.
Do not bring cell phones
into my classroom.
- No, sir.
- It is very fucking rude.
Now, back to where we left off.
Amputation reattachment.
- An amputated arm...
-
...can be surgically reattached
if the patient receives
surgical attention within four hours.
An amputated hand within eight,
amputated fingers within 12.
So, four, eight, 12.
Dr. Grant, I am so sorry.
I'm really embarrassed about that.
Surgeons don't have the luxury about
being sorry about anything, Mary.
I have enough useless twats in my class.
I'm not gonna abide by one of my
- promising students falling asleep.
- I am so sorry.
- I was up all night studying.
- Uh-huh. That's what they all say.
- I was suturing a turkey.
- Uh-huh. Did you eat it afterwards?
It wasn't an eating turkey.
I see great potential in you, Mary,
if you stop fucking up in my class.
I will.
Good surgeons don't
make any mistakes, Mary.
Miss Mason, it says here
that you've been late on a payment.
I know, I called last Friday
and I put $40 in my account.
It does say here that
you did make a payment on Friday.
- But $40 isn't usually enough...
- No one said that my service
was gonna be cut off,
and when I called on Friday,
- they said everything was fine.
-
They obviously made a mistake.
I want you to know that this is
something we don't usually do.
I'm going to restore your service
without a reconnection fee.
When will you be able
to make your next payment?
- Um...
-
I should be able to put some money
on it in... let's say two weeks.
How much do I have to put on
to keep me in the clear?
You are three months behind,
$364 should be enough.
OK. Um, what's the least
that I could put on it?
- $364.
-
Yeah, well, that's
'cause my phone got cut off.
What? Your phone is cut off? When?
Sometime this afternoon, I think.
But everything's fine now.
It's all figured out.
I have a little.
I can go in the bank tomorrow.
No. No, no, no. It's, uh...
I don't need it, Nana.
The, uh...
I've already talked to the bank.
The phone company just made a mistake.
- So everything's OK.
- Oh, good.
Is everyone being nice to you
in the school?
Nobody's trying to lie down
with your boyfriend?
I don't have a boyfriend.
And it doesn't really happen
in med school anyway.
Well, I was watching this
show, and this blonde was trying to make love
to all the boys, and when her friend
find out, she made up a story
so everyone would think she was the one
making love to everyone.
I didn't know that happened. Everyone
today is just taking off their clothes,
saying, "Let's make love."
Like it's nothing.
Well, I'm sure that was
just the show, Nana.
They have to do that
so that people will watch it.
They won't wanna watch
if nothing shocking happens.
They never have that sort of thing
in Budapest.
There was a road, where the women
would be on the corner.
- Corva, the woman.
- Whores.
- Billy?
- Over there.
I'm doing an interview.
Sorry.
-  What's this?
- This is my resume.
I didn't know if you needed one or not.
You don't need it to work here,
but it is nice to find out
some of your dirty secrets.
Thank you... Mary.
Got a lot of schooling on here.
Gonna be a doctor?
- Surgeon.
- Surgeon.
- You any good?
- I'm very good.
And I'm also very broke
and I need to make money, so...
Direct. I like that.
So... Mary.
Now comes the unpleasant portion
of the interview.
You're not fat under there, are you?
No. Starving student.
If you don't mind... Mary. Please.
Appropriate?
Very appropriate.
Rad.
Why don't you try a little walk.
You might wanna walk
a little sexier, Mary.
How about a massage? Come on.
Not through the jacket.
Yeah... A little harder, Mary.
Oh, yeah...
-  We got a clusterfuck.
- Keep going.
Lance, can't you see
I'm doing an interview?
Black's not coming back.
What do you mean
Black's not coming back? Call him.
I called his cell phone
six fucking times.
Fuck!
Wait right here.
Mary, what level are you at
to becoming a surgeon?
I'm... still a ways off.
I have a residency programme to complete,
but I've done almost all the...
Do you wanna make five grand?
- What do I have to do?
- No questions asked.
After you're done, I hand you $5,000
and you don't have to show me your tits.
What do you want me to do?
You know what?
Fucking forget it!
I'll do anything you want
for 5,000 cash tonight.
Follow me.
Oh... Hang on. You good?
- Yes.
- Go.
Yeah, we'd prefer it if Rat
was not to die tonight.
He's already been drugged up,
so feel free to just dig right in.
Whoa...
I'm no expert on the subject here,
but I think that time might be an issue.
Here you go.
It's OK. Shh...
Don't worry. You're gonna be just fine.
Shh... OK.
- Hello?
-  Is this Dr. Mason?
I think you've been calling
the wrong number.
You don't even know who's calling.
- Who's calling?
- My name is Beatress.
I'm quite sure
I don't know any Beatress,
and this isn't a Dr. Mary's number
that you're calling anyway.
But I said Dr. Mason.
Fuck.
- Hello?
-  Hi. I've been trying to call you.
Sorry, I was on the other line.
What's up?
The mall locked us out.
There's no more scheduled shifts
until we get this sorted out.
- What happened?
- I haven't been able to pay the rent.
They got tired of waiting.
Poof, they locked us out.
So... that's it?
Pretty much.
I'll call you if anything changes.
I'm really sorry, Mary.
- Yes?
-  A package. Mary Mason.
What? I'm Mary Mason.
I need you to sign for a package.
Fine. 211.
You didn't really leave me
much choice.
- Who are you?
- You can put the bat down, Dr. Mason.
I'm completely harmless.
My name is Beatress Johnson.
- We spoke earlier.
- How do you know where I live?
It's on your resume.
It's a pretty impressive resume,
with all that doctor stuff on it.
Must be expensive.
Listen, I'm just a desperate woman
looking for help.
Well, if you need some kind of help,
I suggest you go to a hospital.
- What if they refuse to help us?
- Then call your HMO.
- Get it figured out, I don't know!
- It's not a financial issue.
Money, I got lots of. I'll give you $200
if you just let me say what I'm gonna
say, and I'm gonna say anyway.
- And then you'll leave?
- Mm-hm. You'll never see me again.
- Can I see the money?
- Hm.
What do you see when you look at me?
You kind of resemble Betty Boop.
- Kind of?
- Well, it's a little uncanny.
I'm lucky enough to be able to afford to
make myself look on the outside
the way I feel on the inside.
Fourteen different surgeries
to get me to look like this.
Some gone out of the country
to find the best doctor for the job.
In my travels,
I met another girl like me.
But she hasn't been able
to find someone to finish her.
- I wanna hire you.
- Well, I'm not a doctor.
- I told you that.
- I wanna pay you $10,000, cash.
That ought to solve
your money problems for a while.
Especially with what Billy
gave you last night.
I'm not doing what
I did last night again ever.
I'm not asking you to.
She's just... she's a nice girl
who wants an unconventional operation.
- How unconventional?
- She just wants some skin removed
for, um... cosmetic reasons.
My niece, she's a receptionist
at a veterinary clinic.
We can use the operating room
after hours.
I obviously do not have...
...any kind of insurance package
for this kind of thing.
And I can't guarantee
that the skin removal
- will produce the desired effects.
- I'll give you two grand
- just to show up.
- What time does the clinic close?
- Hello?
-  You missed class.
I hope it wasn't our conversation
the previous day that made you
think there are better things to do
than attend my lecture.
No, I had some family matters
to attend to yesterday.
You gave me your word that you
weren't gonna fuck up any more.
I'm not. I won't.
Your actions show that your word
is worth fuck all.
You miss another lecture, you can
find another class to not attend.
Thank you for coming, Dr. Mason.
Beatress, I think we need
to talk about this.
I know.
It's crazy to think that anybody
has that much disposable income,
but I love her.
I just don't want
to see her suffer any more.
Yeah, she's really suffering.
Tessa, honey, don't be a cunt.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry about that.
She's at that difficult age where
if she's not high all the time,
she's just a little bitch
to everybody.
Ten thousand dollars,
and two for showing up.
- Hm. That's one less tit job this year.
- Shut the fuck up, Tessa.
I don't see why you have to pay for it.
She's already had a billion dollars
worth of surgery. Why doesn't her bitch
pay for it like all the other ones?
Tessa, if you're not nice
to Auntie and her friends,
it's not gonna snow
for a very long time.
Like there isn't some jippo already
in your purse.
What exactly does she want me to do?
I think she can probably
explain it best to you herself.
Hi.
Oh. Hello, doctor.
Thank you so much for coming.
Yeah.
OK, um...
So what are we doing here?
Um...
I don't think it's really fair that God
gets to choose what we look like
on the outside, do you?
I'm sorry, that's not
really a fair question.
It'll probably surprise you,
but I've never had any
of these surgeries
to become a sexual object.
- You don't work with Beatress?
- Oh, no.
I'm a fashion designer.
Ruby ReaIGirl designs.
Oh.
No one looks at dolls
in a sexual manner.
- Do you know why?
- I don't know why...
Guess it's 'cause they
don't have all their parts.
Exactly. You understand perfectly.
A doll can be naked
and never feel shy
or sexualised or degraded.
That's what I want.
OK, I'm sorry, I'm not really
understanding you.
Just take these off,
and seal up this as much as possible.
Take off the extra bits too.
Can you excuse me for just a moment?
- She really wants this?
- Oh, yes.
She's dedicated her whole life to this.
Something wrong?
Nope.
All right. I'm going to have you
count backwards from 100 for me.
Starting now.
-
- One hundred, 99,
She's gonna be sore and in a lot of
pain, mostly in the genital region.
I suggest you get her something
with codeine in it.
- That shouldn't be a problem.
- OK.
She's at serious risk for infection
if she doesn't keep
the surgical areas clean
and go see a doctor to make sure
she's healing properly. An untreated
infection, something like mastitis,
- could kill her.
- I have a private doctor for check-ups.
- I'll take her there.
- OK. She is also gonna be very groggy.
You should take her somewhere
where she can heal and rest up.
And walking is going to be painful.
- Thank you so much, Dr. Mason.
- Oh.
Please do not give my name or
information to any of your friends. OK?
Oh, of course not. This was
an exceptional circumstance.
Good. Good luck.
Wait. What should I tell Ruby to call
you for her website when she updates
- the body mod community?
- Make something up.
I want you to know that
the surgery was a complete success.
The scarring should be minimal.
But I'm gonna prescribe you with
scar reduction gel to ensure that.
You may still be feeling a stretching
or pulling sensation
near the incision area,
and that is perfectly normal.
I'm also gonna book an appointment for
you to see your doctor in two weeks,
just to make sure everything's
healing properly.
Good.
Miss Mason, would you please go
tell the family in the waiting room
their father's had a heart attack.
Residents, what do we know?
One of the most important parts of the
healing process is the relationship
the patient feels with their doctor.
A good, composed and confident
bedside manner can be the difference
between a frightened patient
and a calm and confident patient.
Assess what they need to hear
and then tell that to them
in a reassuring manner.
How did that go, Miss Mason?
- They were upset.
- Understandably so.
I want you to go back there
and tell them that he died.
Hone this skill, because it's something
you'll need perfected.
Especially by the time you have
to start delivering bad news.
All right, people, we have rounds to do.
Quick ten minute break,
then I expect to see everyone
back here bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
and ready to take on new patients.
Thank you.
I'm very impressed with
what I've been seeing, Mary.
I can't wait to see how you perform
when you start cutting into people.
You're gonna be a great slasher.
- Pardon me?
- Sometimes we call surgeons slashers.
You must have heard that.
You do develop a grim sense of humour
when you cut into people
on a daily basis.
And the adrenaline rush you get
from slicing into a human being
may help you through
your most sleep-deprived days.
Works better than espresso.
I'm at the hospital doing
a residency programme
- with Dr. Walsh.
-
-  Dr. Grant?
- No, Dr. Walsh.
He's the resident surgeon
who's teaching us.
Oh, good. I caught you at a good time.
- How are you, sweetie?
- Um...
Nana, would you mind if I gave you
a call back when I get home?
OK, sweetheart. You just don't
worry about me, OK?
-
-
Can I help you? Beatress.
What are you doing here?
Oh. You said not to call.
Showing up is worse than calling.
By a lot.
- How did you find me?
- Oh, I just looked up the name
of your school on your resume,
and then I called your school to find out
where the hospital was at that you
were doing your residency.
And then I just decided to come here
and show up and wait.
- What is this?
-
- You do know what it is, then.
- Mm-hm.
- OK.
- Ruby designed it for you special.
She wanted to say thank you.
She was gonna drop it off herself,
but I said I'd deliver it.
I know you don't want strange looks.
Yeah...
Well, tell her thank you for me.
Truly.
- She really didn't have to do that.
- Oh, she wanted to do it.
To say thank you.
You should check out her website,
she puts up all kinds
of new pictures.
I bet you're glad
Ruby didn't show up.
- Yeah. I'm gonna go now.
- OK.
If you ever want to get together
for coffee or something, sometime,
- just girls' night...
- OK. I'll keep that in mind.
- OK.
- OK.
My treat.
- Festivities. It's gonna be...
- Festivities.
I couldn't find any patients
needing surgery on the break,
- so I grabbed a coffee instead.
- Ah, surgeon humour.
I was honestly looking.
How was your break, Mary?
- Good.
- Good.
Mary, I'd like to talk to you about
something without the others around.
- What?
- Some of the surgeons
from the hospital are getting together
tonight for drinks.
We're wondering if you'd
be able to attend.
For drinks? With... other surgeons?
Yes, at Dr. Grant's home.
Do you have the address?
No. I don't have the address.
I'll email it to you.
You'll come then?
I would love to.
Does he know you're inviting me?
It was his idea.
Come around ten. We should have
everything at a good pace by then.
- OK.
- Good.
Come on, we have rounds to do.
Cunts and runts.
- You must be Mary Mason.
- Good guess.
- Why don't you come in?
- Thank you.
- Allow me.
- Thank you.
- Here we are. Hm.
- Wow. It's beautiful.
I'll go get us some drinks.
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.
- Mary Mason.
- Thank you.
- I feel like I know you from somewhere.
- What did you say your name was?
Have a drink.
- Um, are you a surgeon at the hospital?
- I'm a fuckin' motherfucker.
-
-
No, seriously, babe,
I cut people up for a living.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!
- Dr. Black, I see you've met Mary.
- Hi.
I'm done, Walsh.
- Enjoy the party, sweetie.
- Thank you.
Hi, Dr. Walsh.
It's so great to see you.
- How are you?
- Very well, Mary. Thank you.
It's so nice you were able to attend.
What a pretty dress.
- Things must be paying well.
- It was a gift from a friend.
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.
Have some drinks.
Everyone's all over the place.
Some men are out in this area
using it as, I don't know,
some sort of a lobby. And everyone else
is in the other rooms.
I'll go let Dr. Grant
know that you're here.
Thank you.
Well, I hope you finished all your
studying before you came here.
Dr. Walsh runs us
pretty hard in rounds,
so if you don't learn to cram it all in,
you fall behind.
Mm-hm.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Don't fuck up.
- I don't intend to.
- I've been working very hard.
- And?
- And I won't fuck up.
- No. Never.
Everything else is forgivable
if the work is good.
You mean, like, as a person?
I never... thought of it like that.
Isn't the work just as much
a part of yourself?
What do you think, Mary?
I don't really know.
You have to think for yourself, Mary.
No one is gonna hold your hand
through this life.
Everyone here is just
out for themselves.
So how are those turkeys coming along?
Quite well. It's really helping me
with my suturing technique.
Yeah. It's an old pro's secret.
Let me just take that for you, Mary.
Hope our party's matching up well
to the ones you usually attend.
I don't usually attend parties
with doctors and surgeons.
We do do things a little differently.
- He's kind of odd.
- Mm-hm.
Most microsurgeons are.
Did you know in his spare time he likes
to paint people being eaten
by different animals?
Usually a bear.
You're kidding.
Oh, no, I'm not.
I would never kid about something
as fucked up as that.
I hate people who
exaggerate their stories
just to make them sound
more interesting.
So, Mary, I noticed that you
were doing better financially.
Nice new clothes, brand-new stethoscope.
I never thought I'd see you
at one of these.
- I'm sorry, what?
- Whoa, whoa...
- I don't feel good.
- Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
OK, OK. Maybe you just need to lay down
on your back for a moment.
Hm? Whoa, whoa.
- That would be good.
- There you go.
- No good.
- Oops.
Just keep going. There you go.
Lay down on a nice bed here,
you'll feel much better.
Take it easy, take it easy. OK.
Let's go this way, come on. Come on.
Just turn yourself around.
There you go.
- Lay down.
-
Let's make you nice and comfy.
OK?
Relax!
You are so pretty.
So pretty.
Lobby.
Wanna make five grand?
Let me know when you're done.
Lance and I'll come back to get him, OK?
No, you can just go home.
- I won't be done till tomorrow night.
-
All right.
Just give me a call.
I quit med school today.
That shouldn't come
as a surprise to you.
I'm guessing you thought
I went into prostitution.
That's why you invited me
to the party last night.
-
- I didn't.
Please hold still.
Is your jaw numb?
I'm changing specialties, Dr. Grant.
Have you ever heard
of body modification?
Neither had I.
Anyway, you know how
you're always, always
telling me that surgeons
can't make any mistakes?
So... in the spirit of practice,
I've come up with a little list...
...of the most popular procedures
that we are going to try on you...
...tonight.
So... we have...
- ...tongue splitting.
-
I know.
Implants, sometimes referred to
as 3D implants.
Teeth filing.
Genital modification.
And voluntary amputation.
So, I think we should get started.
We have at least 14 hours
of surgery ahead of us.
I would like to get it all done
in one session.
So just going to grab
your little tongue right here.
Isn't this fun?
-
- I'm still learning from you.
I'd say that's healing very nicely.
- I fucking love it.
- You wear it very well.
It was very nice to see you again, Dru.
If there's anything I can do to help you
express yourself any further,
- let me know.
- Thank you very much, doctor.
Have a great day.
- That's fucking gnarly.
- What's fucking gnarly?
Oh.
Genital modification.
There are more procedures available
than there are in the book.
- He must have been hard-core.
- He was. Yes.
Very... hard-core.
I also put together this mod menu.
Maybe it'll help you channel
your creativity.
Henrik, the last time we spoke,
you talked about wanting
to become more unique.
Has anything in the album inspired
any further thoughts on this?
I was thinking about maybe getting some
tribal scarring and some piercings.
Piercings.
- Get out.
- What?
Just get the fuck out.
You 20-year-old Satanist-wannabe reject.
Does it look like
I do piercings in here?
Did you see an advertisement somewhere
for piercings with my name on it?
- No.
- Lance!
Hi. Excuse me, miss.
You Mary Mason?
- Who are you?
- I'm Detective Dolor, Mary.
I'm investigating the disappearance
of Dr. Alan Grant.
The disappearance?
That's terrible.
I haven't seen him
since I left med school.
He didn't really seem like
the kind of guy who'd just vanish,
but, again, I didn't really know him.
Well, he wasn't the sort of guy who
seemed to be a lot of things he was.
We found a lot of questionable things,
things of a deviant sexual nature.
- I'd never have guessed.
- Yeah.
Anyway, a guy called Dr. Walsh
gave us a shortlist of girls
that Dr. Grant may have given a reason
to have something against him.
- You were mentioned on that list.
- In what sense?
Just we should talk to you, that's all.
Why do you think you'd be on that list?
I really have no idea.
He was a tough instructor,
I suppose people could have thought
- he was picking on me, but...
- Yeah, that's quite similar
to what we've been hearing
about your relationship.
So, if you do think of anything,
give me a call.
- I'll be in touch.
- OK.
- Look after yourself.
- Thanks.
Titties and shrimp?
Whoo!
All right!
Come on!
Hey, come on! At least you get to see
some fucking tits!
Hey, I don't know if I entirely trust
the shrimp we make.
How's the shrimp?
- What?
- I asked you how the shrimp was.
Oh.
Uh... What are you doing here?
I thought you had an appointment.
I did. The guy was completely vanilla,
had no idea what he wanted.
- He was asking me for piercings.
- I'm sorry about that.
It's nice to know that after a long day
you like to come visit me.
I'm not here to see you.
Beatress...
...won't stop bothering me
to go out for coffee or something.
I had to make it stop.
Why, do you...
...have a job for me or something?
Cutting? Sewing?
No, Mary.
We just don't torture people
like we used to.
People don't make you mad any more?
No, they make me mad. Just...
...not the same kind of mad.
- People still make me mad.
- Someone bothering you?
Oh, a detective came to talk to me
about Dr. Grant today.
- What does he know?
- Nothing.
Although, he probably wouldn't be
talking to me if Dr. Walsh
didn't tell him to talk to me.
Who's Dr. Walsh?
Another instructor from med school.
I don't know what he knows,
because I blacked out.
You want me to take care of it for you?
No. Thank you.
Very nice of you to ask.
Offer's on the table.
I'm gonna go see if Beatress is ready.
- Yeah, go on in.
- See ya.
I want you to know, if you're taking me
someplace to kill me, I will fight back.
You're hilarious, Mary.
No, I got a surprise for you.
I think you'll get a kick out of it.
You don't want to go to places
I get a kick out of going to.
That might work with the thugs
at the Bourbon A Go Go,
but you don't scare me, Dr. Mason.
- The thugs at Bourbon are scared of me?
- Mm-hm.
Even Billy.
I must be a monster.
You're not. You're a creative artist.
And no one ever understands artists
and their work.
Usually you have to wait
till you're dead.
Then everyone goes around saying
what geniuses you are.
Ruby's been out of town
for a little while.
But she wanted me
to give you something.
- Where is she?
- I don't know.
She gets bored very easily.
She's a very strange girl.
I didn't know Ruby had a boyfriend.
She has many.
That's of her husband.
I found what I was looking for.
- What is it?
- It's your Sistine Chapel.
Looks like something that could have
been sent over email.
Hm. They run the largest body modification
website in the world.
- Abstrakt.me.
- I've heard of it.
'Course you have. They also have
a magazine by the same name
and they feature all kind
of strange and wonderful things.
They want you to work on them ever
since they saw the work you did on Ruby.
- They want me to work on them?
- Mm-hm.
They're gonna be in town for one week.
I'm sure Billy wouldn't mind you
using his office to meet with them.
- Thanks for this, Beatress.
-  Good luck.
-
-
May I offer either one of you a drink?
-  Candy apple martini.
-  I'll have the same.
- Nothing for me, thanks.
- Oh, come on. Don't make us drink alone.
I'll have the same.
Oh. Ruby. Very pleased
with how she worked out.
Is that how you found me?
Through her website?
How we first heard about your work, ja.
Finding you was a different matter.
Your work is easily accessible online.
You might say you're somewhat
of a celebrity.
Bloody Mary.
Bloody Mary? That's online?
Don't worry. We would
never dream of betraying our
doctor-patient confidentiality
by giving out your full name.
But we will be asked
about our procedure.
People will have lots of questions.
You should get
a website for your work.
We can take care of that for you.
Consider it a thank you gift
for agreeing to see us.
Do you feel... connected
to anyone, Mary?
No.
Most people attracted
to this culture don't.
At least you can feel
connected to yourself.
I guess everybody feels
connected to themselves.
Ja und nein.
I have the benefit of being connected
to myself...
...und my sister.
But I know that connection may
or may not last beyond this existence.
We never want to lose
that connection, Mary.
Maybe we'll die together and face
whatever's to come together.
Maybe not.
But should anything ever happen
to one of us before the other,
we never want to lose that connection.
We want you to take off our left arms
and exchange them with one another.
That shouldn't be a problem.
We also want you to strengthen
our connection with ourself.
It's a bit more complicated
than an appendage exchange
and somewhat difficult to put
into words, but we feel that image
best describes the
reflection we... desire.
Of course, the amount you need
for compensation is not an issue.
How's Friday?
- What's that?
- It's my blueprint.
- Goddamn waste of time, if you ask me.
- I didn't.
Thank you for letting me use your club.
Don't mention it.
I need help.
You ain't kidding.
It's a big job, they need to be
operated on at the same time.
Do you know anyone that's good?
I know someone that's just awful.
Who owes me.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
Yeah, that's good.
When you wake up,
you will be connected to yourselves,
and to each other.
Thank you, doctor.
Now, I would like you...
...to close your eyes, breathe deeply,
count backwards from 100.
-
- Just relax,
and it should take effect immediately.
What's that?
- Twins, ja?
- Yeah.
Hello, Dr. Grant.
It's been a while.
Mm-hm.
Oh, what's that?
I couldn't hear you
'cause your mouth is sewn shut.
I know.
Yes, you must be terribly uncomfortable.
We're just gonna take a few pictures
of you today.
For my website. Mm-hm.
For my brand-new website.
Because everyone needs
their own website these days.
And they can scan these or something.
That one probably could
have been done better.
Looks a little bit infected.
Well...
- That one healed nicely, though.
-
You really should have seen it tonight.
My work is getting
consistently stronger.
Comparatively to the work
I've done on you.
It's rather crude, but then again...
...you were never something I was
excessively proud of before, were you?
Oh, really.
So unattractive.
So...
What we're going to do with you today?
I have been asking myself
why your right ear still exists.
Hm...
That one's not very good.
Maybe redo that one
on the other side.
Practice makes perfect,
and surgeons...
...or whatever it is I do now,
can't afford to make mistakes.
-
- Hm...
That definitely needs to go.
Oh, man, what the fuck?!
What the fuck?!
It's OK, dude.
I'm gonna get you down, OK?
I'm gonna call the fucking cops.
- OK.
-
Fuck!
Fuck!
Jesus fuck!
Fuck.
Hey, Lance, can you give
Mary a call, please? I missed it.
I figured you hadn't eaten.
So I picked up a few options.
Not sure what you're in the mood for.
You upset?
Of course I'm upset.
About the two dead guys?
It affects me.
A few years back, this fucking kid
breaks into my mom's house.
One of those B and E motherfuckers.
She hears somebody downstairs, and...
...she grabs her umbrella,
and heads on down.
What the fuck she thought she was gonna
do with that umbrella I'll never know.
But she heads downstairs,
and he grabs the fucking umbrella,
and beats the fucking shit
out of her with the goddamn thing.
Punctures her eye socket,
fractures her jaw,
breaks three of her ribs.
And the little fucker kicks her cell
phone just far enough out of her reach
so she can't call for help.
And then he leaves her there to die.
They find her three days later.
She's in the hospital
for four fucking months.
What I wouldn't give
to have known you back then
when I found that little motherfucker.
Don't you ever
devalue what you do, Mary.
You make sure they deserve it,
and don't waste a minute of your time
thinking about them after you're done.
Is that a milkshake?
I got chocolate and vanilla.
You don't seem like a vanilla.
Thank you, Lance.
It's really good.
Good morning, ladies.
This is about you and how you
can best express yourself to the world.
There are numerous procedures
outlined here, but please,
don't feel limited to them.
The most important thing is that
you're happy and comfortable
with yourself.
I know you may have come up against
some harsh criticisms
and judgments in the past.
But you can feel confident that you're
free of all such notions here.
I can assure you that you'll
receive your procedure
in a safe and supportive environment.
And at a reasonable cost.
It is difficult to put a price
on feeling complete, though.
Isn't it?
You know what I'd really like
to have done next, Mary?
Pull your pants up now.
I will give you some antibiotics.
It should clear that up for you.
I thought when you said "no sex"
it meant no sex.
- Not masturbation as well.
- Well, you would think common sense
would tell you that masturbating
during the healing process
could result in some tearing of skin.
But...
...guess I wasn't clear enough with you,
penis guy.
Excuse me.
- Hello?
- Hi, Mary? It's Detective Dolor.
I was wondering if I could come up
for a bit and have a word.
Of course.
You need to leave right now. Yep.
Gotta go. Thanks. Oh!
- Pills, jacket on you.
- Thanks. So if I take these,
- it'll clear up?
- Yep. Mm-hm.
Absolutely clear it up.
Just leave it alone.
- OK.
- OK. Out you go.
- I'll call you when I'm healed up.
- OK.
Hello, detective.
Was that your boyfriend?
One of them.
Lovely new place.
It's much nicer an area
than the last place, eh?
I like it.
Can I get you a glass of water
or something?
Sure. Yeah.
So did they find Dr. Grant yet?
Not exactly, no.
Now we can't seem to locate
Dr. Walsh either.
Really? That's awful.
Did he have anything to do
with Dr. Grant's disappearance?
No, but they are related.
You see, these two doctors were involved
in hosting sex parties.
The girls involved were drugged
and videotaped.
- Did you know about this?
- No.
I think you do, Mary.
All those girls Dr. Walsh mentioned
were on the tapes.
Was I on the tape?
No.
But I do think you were
at one of those parties.
And I think Dr. Grant is a monster,
and that he really hurt you.
You're the victim here, Mary,
but I can't help you at all
if you won't let me.
- Come on. How close am I?
- You know what?
There's a terrible chip in that glass.
I'm gonna get you a new one.
You just wanna run away from it all,
don't you, Mary?
Believe me, I do understand you,
more than you know.
You know, I really don't feel
comfortable talking about this.
But if anything changes,
I'll be sure to let you know.
I don't want you to be
another sad story, Mary.
You really think about it, yeah?
Next time I see you,
I wanna know,
I'm gonna to find out
what's really going on with you.
There's really not all that much to me.
I find that hard to believe, Mary.
Thank you for your hospitality.
Goodbye, Mary.
Hey, Nana.
Sorry I missed your call... What?
Billy?
Tell me that hasn't happened before.
Go get yourself cleaned up.
These new girls, you know?
They don't even bring resumes or anything.
You got a minute?
Yeah, Mary. For you
I have several minutes. Fuck!
You OK?
Dr. Walsh is missing.
You wouldn't happen to know anything
about that, would you?
No, I don't know anything about that.
All right, I might have had
something to do with it.
But I had the best of intentions, Mary,
I swear.
Did you find a tape of me?
No.
You want me take care of that for you?
I owe you one.
Uh...
- No, we're just gonna scare him.
- I can scare him.
I'll let you know if I need backup.
Excuse me. I need to powder my nose.
- Crazy night, huh?
- Yeah, pretty crazy.
I'm sorry.
It's not entirely personal.
Just the wrong place, the wrong time,
the wrong dick in your mouth.
You know what?
Don't worry about it.
-
-
I'm sorry.
Hey, who let you in?
Sorry, miss,
we're all closed for the night.
What'll it be?
Do you think I'm crazy?
No.
Someone told me that you
were afraid of me.
Who said that?
Is it true?
No.
Beatress quit.
What?
Beatress. She, uh...
...stopped answering my phone calls,
she's not coming in.
I would have preferred a little closure,
but hey, you know?
That's dancers for you.
I didn't think
she had the balls for that.
But guess people can surprise you.
You ever been to LA?
- No.
- You ever wanted to go to LA?
I was thinking I need a change of pace,
you know? Just...
...take a couple weeks off
and drive down.
So, what you do is you drive
from Seattle to Redding.
Stay the night. The second day,
you drive on into LA.
You don't have to kill yourself
on the second day, you know.
You know, you could stop in Sacramento.
On the second day, stay there
the night, and the third day...
Show up in LA, nice and well rested.
Sounds like it'd be a lot easier
to take a plane.
Oh, no.
No, Mary, driving down's half the trip.
You should come with me.
We could...
We could leave tomorrow.
Or tonight.
I'll think about it.
Maybe I need a change of pace too.
Thanks for the drink.
Uh, call me. Let me know.
I will.
Bye, Billy.
Goodbye, Mary.
Yes, Beatress?
You quit the club, I know. What?
He wanted to know...
- Excuse me, I can't hear you.
-
Beatress?
I'm sorry, Mary.
Ruby's husband.
He wanted to know who you were,
and where you lived.
I didn't wanna tell him.
He forced me.
He started to hurt me.
I'm so sorry, Mary.
I didn't know Ruby had a boyfriend.
