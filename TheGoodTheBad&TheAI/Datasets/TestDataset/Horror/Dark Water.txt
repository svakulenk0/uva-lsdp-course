WOMAN: Dahlia,
let's go inside now.
She'll come soon,
but let's go inside now.
What are we gonna do,
Dahlia?
What are we gonna do about your
mother always being so late?
Hi.
Hi.
Did you ring?
It's not 11.
You didn't ring.
Good. You're early.
You can come right in.
You've been subletting?
MAN: Right.
When my construction company
moved me to New York,
the rents were out of sight,
so we only took a one-year lease.
And when my wife
asked me to leave,
I got a small one-bedroom
in Jersey City that's cheap.
How much?
Where will Cecilia sleep
then?
There's a pullout couch
in the living room,
so when she comes to stay
with me, I'll sleep there.
I can't afford two bedrooms.
WOMAN: How 'bout you, Dahlia?
We to know what your situation is gonna be.
Any luck in finding a suitable
place for you and Cecilia?
I'm looking at apartments today.
Where?
Where?
Yeah, I told you, I'm moving to Jersey City.
There's a school there--
it's great.
And there's plenty of cheap
places to rent, so...
You got an apartment near me, it would
make the shared custody easier.
Why do you want her, Kyle?
What do you mean,
why do I want her?
You were never interested
in her before.
What?
You know, he forgot her fifth birthday.
No. No, I didn't.
No?
No, I didn't. The plane
was stuck on the tarmac,
and we didn't have a gate.
I told you a million times,
the phones didn't work.
No one believes you, 'cause
everyone knows what you were doing.
Everyone? No, you. Only you.
OK.
You see? She's crazy.
You live in a world of your own.
I make one mistake,
and I don't care about Ceci?
You don't like playing with her!
You're insane!
Be honest with yourself.
You can't raise Ceci alone.
You can't handle it.
Just be honest with yourself.
DAHLIA: Isn't it funny
how small the cars look?
Yeah.
If you look at them from up here.
Fit them between your fingers,
if you squint.
Yeah.
DAHLIA: Oh, look.
There's a tram.
And that's where we're going,
Roosevelt Island.
Mommy, that's not the city.
Sure it is.
Just a different part of the city.
No, that's the city over there.
That's not the city.
She's right.
CECI: Mm-hmm.
It is chilly, though,
isn't it? Are you cold?
CECI: Yeah, a little bit.
Yeah?
Hey, look, that's where
you'd go to school.
I don't want to go
to school here.
Why not?
It's too small.
Oh, I see.
Mm-hmm.
You know, I got your snack for ya.
You do?
Yeah. Are you hungry now?
Do you want it now?
Maybe I'll wait.
OK.
Let's just check.
Let's see. 540...
Just...
OK.
It's nice here.
It's like a small town.
I like the big city better.
Why didn't we rent that last place?
It was really nice.
It was. It was too expensive
for us, honey.
We need something
that's a better price.
But I don't want
to live here, Mommy.
Why not, Ceci?
It's all the same.
And it's small. Too small.
It's too small?
I think you're too small.
No, I'm not. I'm big.
Small.
I'm big.
OK, good. Then are you gonna be a big
girl and give this one a chance?
Yeah? 'Cause otherwise
you know what happens?
What?
My itsy-bitsy muffin.
I cover you all up with jam
like this, and then...
And then eat you up.
OK. That's us.
We are a little bit early.
We need...
Oh, golly. Five...
Hi.
Hi.
Are you Mrs. Bernstein?
No, I'm Ms. Williams.
Ah, Ms. Williams.
Oh, you're early.
Mr. Murray.
We spoke on the phone.
Listen, since the Bernsteins aren't
here, I can show you the apartment now.
You're lucky to get
a jump on them, actually.
OK, that'd be great.
So we'll just go up, and...
Thanks.
Hello.
Hi.
These tend to go pretty quick.
You know, Manhattan is so expensive,
and this is practically in Manhattan.
I mean, it's five minutes away.
Yucky.
This is yucky.
It is a little yucky
down here,
which is why we are repainting
all these lobbies this summer.
And I think they're
replacing all the doors,
if I'm not mistaken. It'll make
it a lot brighter in here.
This is Mr. Veeck.
He is the super for building C.
Hello.
Mr. Veeck,
can you say hello?
Hello.
This is... What is your name?
Dahlia. This is Ceci.
I'm sorry. Dahlia and Ceci.
Uh... Mr. Veeck lives in 1A.
He's been here for 20 years.
He'll fix anything
that goes wrong.
Oh, that's good.
Which is a big savings,
'cause he does it for free.
There's also a doorman on duty
from four to midnight here,
so you don't have to worry
about coming in late.
And that is the lobby.
Mr. Veeck,
if the Bernsteins show up,
just send them right up to 9F.
OK.
OK.
OK, so,
we'll just head up here.
Did you take the tram?
DAHLIA: Yeah.
Oh, you did. Did you like that?
CECI: Yeah.
You get to do that every day
when you live in this building.
Oh, yeah.
There's the camera.
Say hi.
Mr. Veeck is watching us
I'm gonna take you up to nine.
It's almost our top floor.
I call it
the lower penthouse level.
Um... You get some city views
up there.
A little cut off, but you can still
see the city lights... at night.
And, um...
Oh, you know, we're two
blocks from the school.
which is one of
the best in the city.
Yeah, I was just reading that.
Isn't that great?
No.
I don't like it here, Mommy. I wanna go--
Ceci, please.
Sorry, Mommy.
That's OK.
MURRAY: It's OK.
You're gonna love it up here.
And they just opened
a pizza place on the island.
Do you like pizza?
I bet you do.
I like pizza, too.
I like it a little bit too much.
Wait, sweetie.
Don't run. Don't run.
Get stuck in here, huh?
Mommy, what happened?
Sorry. It's all right.
Dammit.
Another puddle.
I'm sorry about that.
I keep telling Mr. Veeck
he's gotta mop in there
every morning.
You know, with all this
rain we're having,
you can't stop some of it from
coming down that elevator shaft.
There's just no way to stop it.
Anyway, here's 9F down here.
The building was built in 1976
by Stern-Jackson and associates,
in the brutalist style.
Um... Now, what they were
trying to create,
as you can see,
was kind of a little village,
kind of a Utopia, actually,
is what they had in mind.
And some of those ideas
have come together.
Some of their original plans for
the place were a little crazy,
if you ask me.
Hello.
Yeah, I just do that
just in case. It's vacant.
Come on in.
Shall I close this?
Yeah. Let me just apologize in advance.
The place is in a little bit of a mess.
Our last tenant
was a little messy,
but we're gonna put a fresh new
coat of paint on this whole place.
It's gonna brighten it up
quite a bit.
Let's take a look
at your bedroom, sweetie.
This could be your room
if Mommy wants it to be.
What do you think? Isn't that great?
There's no air in here.
Of course there's air in here. If there
wasn't air, we wouldn't be able to breathe.
That window does not open, but it lets a
lot of natural light in in the afternoon.
It's really great.
DAHLIA: Strange.
MURRAY: I kinda like it.
In the afternoon, it brightens
the place up quite a bit.
Anyway, here's the closet.
You could put your dollies
in there
or, you know, Mom could use it
for storage.
Lemme show you the bathroom. OK?
OK.
Come on, honey.
Is this another closet here?
Yeah, that's the foyer closet.
The bathroom's pretty
self-explanatory.
It's in decent shape.
Once we clean it up.
You got the toilet, of course,
the sink, bathtub.
This glass is safety glass.
I mean, you could hit that as hard
as you want - it will not break.
And that is great for your
peace of mind, you know,
when Ceci's taking a bath
or what have you.
DAHLIA: Hey, Ceci.
Come look in here.
Ah, you're right. That's much better.
You can smell the river.
Can you smell that?
DAHLIA: Yeah.
Let me show you the other
bedroom here.
You know, it's tough to get
two bedrooms in Manhattan
or any of the boroughs,
for under a thousand dollars.
OK, that's a closet.
Scratch that.
That's a closet.
Um... Kitchen.
Got the refrigerator,
sink, stove,
and this is kind of
a country eat-in dining room.
You see this. It's just really
smart how they did this.
See that little thing?
Boom - dining room.
You can put your stools around it
or whatever, and when you're done,
out of the way, no clutter.
The dishwasher, if you're entertaining,
very convenient to have.
Kitchen. OK.
And then here
is the other bedroom.
So, where's the living room?
Well, it's kind of
a living-room-slash-bedroom.
It's called a dual-use room.
You can see it's the size
of two rooms. It's huge.
Anyway, did you see the view?
Did you see that?
Look at that. That is a million-dollar
view for $900 a month.
I mean, I don't even
have that where I live.
You're not gonna do better
than that. I guarantee it.
Listen, I'm just gonna
cut to the chase here.
We could have this painted
this weekend.
You could move in on Monday,
and, you know,
we could just fill out
the forms right now.
I understand you want some time
to walk around, think about it.
Let me just check on Ceci.
Sure, sure. Yeah.
Ceci.
She's just making herself
at home. It's OK, Mom.
Ceci.
You know how they are.
She's just exploring.
Mr. Veeck. Mr. Veeck.
Did my daughter come down here?
What?
My daughter.
The little girl that I came with.
The little girl.
Did she get on the elevator?
No. I see no one.
Just him.
Yeah, there was a little girl
in the stairwell.
Ceci.
Ceci.
Ceci.
Ceci. Are you in there?
MURRAY: Hello?
Yeah?
What are you doing down here?
I saw someone go in.
Did you check the stairs
all the way to the roof?
Ceci!
Look, Mommy. Hello Kitty.
I got a Hello Kitty bag.
Ceci. Ceci!
Don't you ever do that again!
Do you understand?
Don't you ever run away from me,
and you never come up on the roof.
Sorry.
Do you understand me?
It's not safe for you up here.
You could have fallen.
Sorry, Mommy.
OK?
How can you leave this unlocked?
There's no railing here.
It's totally irresponsible,
It's supposed to be locked.
Well, it wasn't.
Yeah. Sorry.
Are you OK, honey?
Yeah.
You're so lucky
you found that.
My niece loves Hello Kitty.
Did you look inside it?
No. Mommy, can I look?
It's not yours, sweetie.
Oh, I'm sure she can keep it.
There's no other children in the building.
No children?
Why? It's so close to the school.
Oh, they all grew up.
You know, they're all teenagers now.
You know, hardly anybody ever
moves out 'cause of rent control.
Oh, there are other children
on the island.
You know,
in the other buildings.
You would have
many, many friends.
So cute.
Mr. Veeck, why was the door
to the roof open?
What?
The roof.
My daughter found this
on the roof.
The roof? Where?
Just lying there.
Mr. Veeck. Why didn't you
lock the door to the roof?
I did.
No.
She opened it and walked right out.
Now, what if she'd gotten hurt?
That's negligence, Mr. Veeck,
and I'll call the union myself.
You get fired for cause, and you
can kiss that pension goodbye.
What do you talk about?
I check it.
Hour ago, it was locked.
Someone else open it.
Well, whose bag is this?
What do I know?
Well, look inside it, please.
I'm so sorry about this.
As you can see, we're having a little
bit of a communication problem.
We'll get it worked out.
DAHLIA: I was wondering
if you have a card, so...
MURRAY: Oh, absolutely.
Absolutely.
Just don't wait too long.
VEECK: Hey. Hey.
Ceci.
That's not yours. OK?
You can't keep that.
Look, it's brand-new.
Someone's gonna come back
for it.
Can you give it back,
please?
Doll.
Ceci.
MURRAY: Aw. Poor thing.
DAHLIA: Good girl. Thank you.
I'll tell you what. Mr. Veeck
will hold on to it for a week,
and if no one comes, then you
can come by and get it. OK?
In one week.
No one comes, it's yours.
You see? You'll see,
no one will come.
Thank you, Mr. Veeck.
Please check on that lock again.
We're gonna live here,
right, Mommy?
What?
We're gonna move here, right?
I want to.
I really wanna move here.
See?
From the mouths of babes.
DAHLIA: Excuse me just one moment.
OK.
DAHLIA: Talk about it,
I guess.
Now, we don't have
to move here
for you to get
a Hello Kitty backpack.
I know that.
You know that?
I really like this place, Mommy.
I wanna live here.
You said it was
the right kind of price for us.
I did say that. It's a little
bit smaller than I hoped.
Please, Mommy.
Can we live here?
I'm over here.
Over here.
Over here.
We'll take it.
Oh, I have the Bernsteins...
I'll give you a deposit
right now.
You're sure?
Yeah. I'm sure.
OK.
OK.
Yeah. I have the forms here.
If want, we can go in...
Let's go back in the office.
OK.
Ceci, you wanna come?
I'll be right back.
I can explain to them.
That's all right.
They have a lot of choices.
KYLE: 'Cause it's insanely
inconvenient, that's why.
I gotta drive
through the tunnel,
get uptown to cross the 59th
Street Bridge to Queens,
so I can cross another goddamn
bridge to get to the island.
You could take the subway.
The subway?
You want me to take the PATH to the F?
Are you kidding me?
It'll take a hour.
I'm suing.
What?
You move there, and I'm
suing for full custody.
Mr. Williams.
Threats are not appropriate.
Ms. Williams has a right to--
Are you moving to Roosevelt Island?
Look at this. Look at this.
I want an answer.
The elementary school there is one of the
best in the city, and it's next door,
so all Ceci would have to do
is walk two blocks.
Just look at it.
If this is really about Ceci, maybe
you could move to Roosevelt Island,
'cause there are lots
of places for rent there.
That's ridiculous.
Is it? Why?
I already signed a lease.
You're lying.
I'm not listening to this.
She's there.
She's in Jersey City, and that's
what this is really about.
I'm done talking.
Better get yourself a lawyer.
A good one.
I'm sorry to say
that's good advice.
Nobody came, right?
What?
The Hello Kitty bag.
Nobody came, right?
It's only been four days, kid.
Don't get your hopes up.
Hey.
Hello.
Hello.
After you, my love.
Thank you.
Let's try...
In here?
No.
I'm ready for something
to drink. How about you?
Uh... maybe, yeah.
Or maybe something to eat.
Ooh, let's put you in the box.
Can you hold your breath
underwater?
Yeah.
You can?
How long do you think
you can hold it for?
Seven.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Look, Mommy.
Look how high I can jump.
Are you trying to break your
new bed on the first night?
No.
Don't break your bed.
OK. Look, Mommy.
I'm gonna reach the ceiling.
What is that?
Looks like a leak.
How?
I'll have to tell them
about that in the morning.
Horrible.
Anyway, what should we read?
Muy Bien.
Wow.
The sound really carries.
Yeah.
Mommy.
Hmm?
Can you fix my hair?
I'd love to fix your hair.
What do you want?
Do you want a ponytail?
Or a braid?
A braid.
OK.
You wanna practice for today?
OK.
Boys and girls,
today I want you to meet
your new classmate.
Her name is Cecilia Williams.
Everyone say hello to Cecilia.
Hi, Cecilia.
Hi.
I think you can do
better than that.
Do you wanna try again?
OK.
Hi, Cecilia.
Hi, everybody.
That's my girl.
That's my smart,
beautiful, beautiful girl.
How's that?
It's perfect.
You do it perfect.
You put your shoes on,
which are right there.
Keys, which are...
I know where they are.
Huh.
Shit. Shit!
Mommy.
What?
You cursed.
Put your shoes on, OK?
OK.
Do you need help with those?
Yeah.
WOMAN: Please pick up your finger
paints from the back of the room.
Remember to mix the colors.
Red and yellow make...
CHILDREN: Orange.
Great.
Good morning. Hi.
Hi, Cecilia.
You know what?
We are gonna have
so much fun today.
We're finger-painting, so we're
gonna get all messy. Look. See?
The messier the better.
DAHLIA: That's fine.
Are you ready to come
meet all your new friends?
Great. Why don't you come
with me, sweetheart?
Bye, sweetheart.
Wanna say goodbye to your mama?
Bye, darling girl.
I'll be here at 3:30
to pick you up.
Love you, Mommy.
Oh, I love you so much.
Go have fun.
Come on, sweetheart.
OK, everybody.
Listen up, now.
I want you to give a big,
warm, huge welcome
to our new friend Cecilia.
Hi, Cecilia.
Hi, everybody.
I'm Cecilia.
You want the elevator?
Uh...
Actually,
I was looking for you.
There's a leak
in my bedroom ceiling.
Breaking news, huh?
Pipes is 30 years old.
Leaks all over the building.
So does that mean
you won't fix it?
Fix a leak?
Look, all I can do is
patch up the ceiling.
If you wanna fix the leak, you gotta
get Murray to call a plumber.
Mr. Murray.
Mr. Murray.
OK. I'll call him.
Do.
OK.
WOMAN: So, you worked
as a copy editor?
Yeah. Back in Seattle, I did copy
editing and some fact-checking.
Why do you want this job? Pay's not that
good, sure as hell ain't interesting.
Oh, I'd try
something different,
I've always been
interested in medicine.
Medicine? Oh, honey,
this ain't medicine.
See, what you do is you Xerox their
insurance card, hand them a form,
and give them a pitcher
of bug-juice to drink.
Are you sure
you wanna do this?
Come on, you can tell me.
I'm not exactly
a model citizen.
I'm separated from my husband.
My daughter and I just moved
to Roosevelt Island.
You're a five-minute
subway ride,
the hours are perfect,
and you have a medical plan.
Well, you're hired, honey.
But you gotta promise me one thing.
What?
In six months' time,
when you find a better job,
please take me with you.
OK. Thank you.
MURRAY: Hello.
DAHLIA: Hi. Mr. Murray?
Yeah.
Hi. It's Dahlia Williams.
Dahlia Williams.
From 9F.
9F.
Yeah.
Hey, how about
that paint job?
Yeah...
Great work, right?
Thank you, but, um...
Actually I have a leak
in my bedroom ceiling
A leak?
Yeah.
Did you tell Mr. Veeck?
I did, I told him. He said that
he could patch the ceiling,
but that to repair the leak, you
would need to call a plumber.
I don't know
what he's talking about.
If he needs to open the ceiling
and fix the pipe, he can do it.
He doesn't need a plumber.
Listen.
Just tell him I said...
Just tell him Mr. Murray said
that he should fix the leak.
OK. I'll... I'll try.
Listen, say hello to little
Cathy for me, too, OK?
Ceci. I'm sorry.
OK.
OK. Bye-bye.
Hi.
It's lunch hour.
Just quickly.
I spoke to Mr. Murray,
and he said that you should fix
that leak that I told you about.
Look, I'm not a plumber.
I keep telling him.
I'm not responsible
for building's plumbings.
My job is make sure
boiler's working,
mop floors,
put out the garbage,
But I'm not a plumber.
No, I understand.
It's just Murray
that you could fix it.
Well, I can't.
Hello.
Wouldn't stop, right? Took you up to ten?
It does that sometimes. It just goes up
to ten, no one's even called for it.
I think when it rains a lot, it messes
with the contacts or something.
Which floor?
Nine, please.
OK, we'll take you back up,
and then I'll go down.
OK. Thank you.
Shit. Come on.
Who did this?
This building is falling apart.
Bye.
See ya later.
DAHLIA: I've talked
to Veeck twice now,
and he says he's not a plumber
and he can't fix it,
so I'm wondering,
is there maybe a super
from one of the other buildings
who could do it.
I can't do that.
See, C is Veeck, and Veeck is C.
If I do that, then I have
the unions screaming at me
about violating
work rules and...
and I can hear that there's
someone running water upstairs
You know, it might not even be a leak.
It might be flooded or something.
Did you say upstairs?
Right above me.
In 10F?
Upstairs.
You know, maybe it's their tub
that's overflowed or something.
I don't know.
No, that can't be right.
Listen, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna call Mr. Veeck
personally. OK?
I'm gonna take care of this right away.
So don't worry about it.
I'm gonna get right on it.
I'm sorry. I'm with a client right now.
I'll call you later, as soon
as I take care of it, OK?
Thank you.
OK. No problem. Bye-bye.
LITTLE GIRL:
Mommy, wake up.
Ceci?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, God. Oh, God.
What are you doing here?
Take it easy.
It's flooded.
The fuckin' brats.
I'm gonna kill 'em.
You see them coming outta here?
Who?
Asshole Steve. 3F.
And his buddy, dumb Billy, 7E.
You don't know them?
No.
Look. Here's the story.
Father's left the country.
Where the mother is,
God knows.
They've been away for months.
Probably not coming back.
Those punks have stolen a key
and get in here.
Why?
What do I know?
Drugs.
Wacky baccy, you know.
Look, I clean up this place, and
then I come down to your place. Huh?
Murray called me.
I tell him I take care of it.
Yeah. I patch it up tomorrow,
when it's dry.
No extra charge, you know?
Thank you.
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the waterspout
TEACHER: Then what?
And it washed the spider out
OK.
It's OK.
Sorry.
You can be 10,
even 15 minutes late.
We have this after-school program
that runs until 5:30, so...
Many of the kids stay for it.
Uh... Is there a charge for that?
It's $30 a week.
Which is actually
quite reasonable.
No, that's good. That's good.
I think I'll have to do that,
'cause I'll be working
till five every day.
OK. Well, we can set that up.
OK.
Surprise, surprise, there's another
form you have to fill out,
but we can do that now.
This will be good for Cecilia.
It will help her fit in faster,
and she could use
some real friends,
don't you think?
What do you mean?
Well, it's not unusual to have
imaginary friends at this age.
Nowadays we know
not to bug them about it,
but it isn't so great that she's
playing with an imaginary friend
when there are real children
for her to play with here.
Are you saying that Ceci
has an imaginary friend?
And washed the spider out
Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain
And the itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the spout again
I made you a snack
for after school.
I had it all wrapped up
and ready to go,
and then I was rushing,
and I forgot it.
It's OK.
Sorry.
What did you think of your teacher?
She was very nice.
Did you make any friends today?
Uh-huh.
Who?
Nobody.
Nobody?
Very funny name
for a friend, "Nobody."
Mommy.
"Nobody. My name is Nobody."
Did anyone come?
What?
For Hello Kitty.
Did anyone come?
No. Not yet.
Thanks for taking care of the ceiling tomorrow.
I appreciate it.
It looks really ugly now.
Good.
Are you gonna stay
in my bed tonight?
Close your eyes.
I'm very proud of you
for today.
Sweet dreams, honey.
The itsy-bitsy spider
LITTLE GIRL:
Went up the waterspout
And washed the spider out
And dried up all the rain
The itsy-bitsy spider
Itsy-bitsy spider...
Went up the spout again
...the spout again
Well, I still don't
really know anyone here,
so I'm not really sure
who to ask.
Except Bill and Stacy, but
he's Kyle's friend from work,
so I can't ask him.
I think it'd be a lot easier for her
back there in Seattle, you know?
WOMAN: Well, what about
the mediators?
Maybe they can recommend
somebody.
Yeah, I asked them, but they're
supposed to be impartial.
so they can't recommend anyone.
Oh.
I don't know.
I guess maybe I'll try
and find someone out of
the Yellow Pages or some--
Dahlia, you can't pick some random
lawyer out of a phone book.
Mary, I'm gonna have
to call you back later, OK?
I have to go downstairs
and deal with this.
All right. I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
CECI: Stop it.
She'll catch you.
No, I'm not allowed
to go to the roof.
'Cause it's dangerous, and by
the ways, it's spooky at night.
Who are you talking to?
Nobody.
Is it your friend Nobody again?
Do you have an invisible friend
only you can see?
Is it a boy or a girl?
Girl.
How old is she?
My age. Almost exactly.
She was born a month
before me.
So she's older.
Wow. What's her name?
Natasha.
Natasha? That's a really
interesting name.
Where'd you get
that name from?
It's just her name.
Night, Mom.
If I leave my post and
Mr. Murray finds out, I'm dead.
OK, but if they leave
the water running,
then my bedroom ceiling
could collapse.
You understand?
Yeah, I understand.
But what you gotta understand
is if I leave now,
I might as well go straight to Unemployment.
And that's not gonna happen.
Look, I'm sorry. I don't know if you
want me to call the cops or something.
Just give me a second. Hang on.
It's all right, never mind.
I'll deal with it.
And thanks for your help.
All right.
Are you OK?
Can I help you?
I told you.
I told you to leave me alone.
Mom?
Get away from me, you little bitch.
Mommy?
I hate you.
Let me help you.
I hate you.
Do you hear me?
I hate you.
No.
Just go! Go!
Mommy. Mommy.
What... What?
You're scaring me.
What's wrong?
You were having
a bad dream again.
Again?
You always make that sound
when you sleep.
I do?
Ever since Daddy left.
Stop doing that, OK?
OK.
It scares me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
There's nothing
to be scared of.
Have a good day.
See you later.
OK. Bye, Mommy.
MARY: Yeah, he was a frat
brother of Joe's at Wash U.
Joe says he's as smart
as a whip.
If he was at college with Joe, I guess
he's been practicing for a while.
Well, actually, he got a late
start on being a lawyer.
He lost a decade to partying.
A decade?
No, seriously,
Joe says he's really good,
and he won't charge you
an arm and a leg.
His name is Platzer.
OK.
P-L-A...
Right.
This mess was sloppy,
unprofessional.
I mean, I know I get caught,
but my work? My craft?
My craft ain't sloppy.
That much is true.
Thank you.
Mr. Platzer, hi. My name
is Dahlia Williams.
Hi, Mrs. Williams.
John told me you'd be calling.
I can't meet till next week,
so why don't you give me
opposing counsel's name
and number,
and I'll give him a call and get
up to speed on their issues.
Sure. My husband's lawyer's
name is Carrie Simmons.
That's OK,
I know Carrie's number.
This is not gonna be so easy.
We should meet Monday.
Where do you work?
I'll come by on your lunch hour.
It's Sutton Place Radiology.
You're being very nice,
but I'm sorry,
I just have to ask, how
much is that gonna cost me?
We'll figure the money out.
I'll call Carrie, get up to speed,
and then we'll go over
everything Monday,
including my fee, OK?
OK. Thanks so much.
OK. Bye.
Bye-bye.
You're gonna figure
the money out?
That's some sweet thing
you're figuring money for.
You gonna figure my money too?
You're lucky
I don't charge you double.
ASSISTANT: OK,
so everyone looking at me.
And do you all have a piece of tape?
Show me, show me.
Put it somewhere silly.
Somewhere silly.
Your forehead, your nose.
Make a beard.
OK. Now put it on the back
of your picture,
and then you're gonna follow me
into the hallway
'cause we're gonna put them up.
Ten, nine, eight,
a-seven, a-six
five, four, three, two, one.
Beautiful.
Anyone else need tape?
BOY: I do.
If it's not sticking...
Mom, you're early.
I know.
The subway was so much faster
than the tram.
I was at work ten minutes ago.
Isn't that amazing?
I think we picked
the perfect place to live.
Daddy doesn't like it here.
He wants me to move with him
to that other city.
Oh. When did Daddy say that?
Today. He came to see
what my new school was like.
Hmm.
I gotta go.
OK. I'll be waiting for you.
OK.
Yeah, he came by to give us his cell
phone number in case of an emergency.
He was with Cecilia
for a few minutes.
He said hi,
he looked at the room.
Is there some problem?
Is he not allowed to?
Is there some restraining order
against him?
No. No.
I was just...
wondering if Ceci was...
Still imagining things?
Actually, I'm glad you
brought that up.
Her imaginary friend
hasn't gone away.
In fact, she threw somewhat of
a tantrum during circle time
when we wouldn't let
her "friend" sing along.
I had to have her
take a time-out.
I'm sorry. I'll certainly
talk to Ceci about that.
You know, the PTA provides
a psychologist, Katie Shoettle.
She's very nice.
She comes every Wednesday.
It's absolutely no charge.
I'll talk to Ceci about it.
It'll stop.
I'm really sorry about that.
You'll see. Couple of days,
blend right in.
You won't see the difference.
I'm sure you're right.
Thank you.
You know, those kids were up there
again last night, running around.
I could hear them
running water, so...
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna speak with Murray
about changing the lock on 10F.
You know what he told me?
Rimsky paid no rent this month.
He's probably not coming back anyway.
OK.
Well, that would be great
if you could change the lock.
Starting to have nightmares
about what's going on up there.
Really?
You gotta relax, huh?
Can I get you something
before you go? Yeah.
Get me a reward for all this
hard work I've been doing.
Yeah? I think I have beer.
You want a beer?
I don't drink beer.
Coffee? I could make a pot
of coffee if you want.
Oh, forget it.
I've been working hard today.
I'm tired. I'm going.
OK. Well, thank you.
What about Hello Kitty?
Can I have it now?
Oh, so sorry, kid.
Somebody came by for it today.
They were visiting town,
left it there by accident.
Oh, that little girl, she was
so happy to have it back.
You're lying.
Ceci.
He's lying, Mommy. Nobody came.
You want to teach that goddamn
brat some manners, lady.
Sorry.
What is the matter with you?
Mm.
Mac and cheese.
My favorite.
I love you, Mommy.
I love you too, sweetheart.
I love you very much.
But, you know, it was very wrong
to call Mr. Veeck a liar.
You know that, don't you?
He is a liar.
Ceci. You don't know
that he's a liar.
Yes, I do.
How? How do you know that?
Natasha told me he still had the
Hello Kitty backpack in his desk.
I want to talk to you
about your imaginary friend, OK?
She's not imaginary.
She's not?
She's lost.
Her mommy forgot about her,
and now she's lost.
Like you.
What are you talking about?
Your mommy forgot
about you, right?
Did someone tell you that?
You did.
No. I didn't tell you that,
Ceci.
Who told you that?
Are you gonna answer me?
I'm asking you a question.
Who told you?
Natasha told me.
Stop it.
You stop lying to me.
Who told you?
Who told you?
Who told you?
Hello?
KYLE: Hi. Listen, I'm just calling to...
What are you trying to do?
Sneaking into her school,
telling her it isn't any good?
Talking to her about my mother?
How dare you talk to her
about my mother!
Look, I don't know who or what
pressed your wacko button today,
and I don't care.
I'm calling to tell you
I'm picking up Ceci
Saturday at nine.
I'll bring her back
Sunday at six.
Don't play any games.
Have her there, 9am sharp.
I tell you punks.
No skating in here.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey!
Look at you.
You shouldn't
be smoking, Daddy.
I'm gonna quit real soon,
honey, I promise.
Thank you, Daddy.
Satisfied?
As far as I'm concerned, you can
smoke as much as you like, Kyle.
Honey.
I'll bring her back tomorrow at six, OK?
OK.
Bye, Mommy.
Bye, honey.
Hey, pretty lady.
What's happening?
Laundry. Excuse me.
I got some dirty things
I'd like you to clean.
Sorry.
I forgot my smokes.
Help!
Smart-ass kids.
Steve and Billy.
They did this.
You'll see.
Monday, the plumbers come.
They'll find something stuck in there.
They gum 'em up. Brats.
Who's Natasha?
What?
Who's Natasha Rimsky?
Little girl. 10F.
Where is she now?
How do I know? With her mother, I guess.
Couldn't stand living with that
crazy Russian husband of hers.
Took the little girl with her.
That Russki, he was a piece of work.
"Suki yobanye."
"Blyad. Blyad."
Look, there's a Laundromat
down the block.
I'll get you some garbage bags
so you don't get wet
carrying them there.
LITTLE GIRL:
The itsy-bitsy spider
Hi, Mommy.
Glad you like spaghetti
and meatballs.
It's my favorite.
Your favorite?
I love them, Mommy.
I'm glad.
Mm.
I love you, Mommy.
You haven't said anything about
what your dad's new place is like.
I don't like it.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, maybe it's just new and
you need to get used to it.
But I don't wanna
get used to it.
I don't wanna stay with Daddy.
I only wanna stay with you.
Well, your dad loves you.
He'll be happy that you
spent this time with him.
Itsy-bitsy spider
Down came the rain
and washed...
Honey, can you stop
singing that?
Why? It happened.
HI want to go to bed now, Mommy.
sI'm tired.t?
Mommy?
Hmm?
I'm scared, Mommy.
I want to sleep with you.
Yeah.
I love you, Mommy.
Thank you
for taking care of me.
Ceci?
Hello?
Mommy, where were you?
I was napping.
No, not now.
Last night.
Where were you last night?
I called two times for you
to just say good night to me.
Where were you?
Last night? Um...
Daddy says he's bringing me
home a half an hour early.
He says to be there
in the lobby at 5:30.
Don't fall asleep again, Mommy.
OK.
I gotta go. I'm getting
chocolate cake.
Bye.
Bye.
MARY: Dahlia, where have you
been? I left two messages.
I lost a day, Mary.
I took a pill, just one pill,
and it knocked me out
for 24 hours.
That's never happened before.
And I'm tired, really tired.
It's like
I haven't slept at all.
Dahlia, are you OK?
Are you really OK?
My headache's gone.
But the leak is back.
It's back? I thought they
were gonna fix that thing.
Dahlia?
Yeah?
Yeah, I'm fine.
ANSWER PHONE: You have five
new messages. First new message.
MARY: Long nap, huh?
Call me.
ANSWER PHONE: Message erased.
Next message.
Hi, Jeff Platzer here. I got the
preliminaries from your husband's lawyer,
and I need to touch base with you about
his accusations as soon as possible.
Believe it or not I'm actually available
on Sunday afternoon until five.
If you are, would you call
my cell? OK. Bye.
Believe it or not I'm actually available
on Sunday afternoon until five.
MAN: Mrs. Williams?
Yeah.
Hi. I'm your lawyer.
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, I'm sorry it's such a mess.
No, it's OK.
I just moved into a new office
and they've painted it.
I can't stand the smell,
so I'm improvising.
OK.
Hi.
Hi.
So...
OK, um...
Your husband's claiming
you're mentally unstable
because your father
was physically abusive
and your mother was an
alcoholic who abandoned you.
That's, uh...
unbelievable.
What do my parents
have to do with this?
That's my question
exactly.
What's more relevant is
that your husband says
you suffer from
crippling migraines
and paranoid delusions.
He says he'll submit
school reports
that show your daughter is beginning
to share your fantasy life.
"Cecilia is now having trouble
distinguishing
between what is real
and what is not."
It's a lie. It's a lie.
In child custody briefs, it's standard
to make these kinds of accusations.
Don't take it too seriously.
But I do need to know what,
if anything,
in your husband's narrative
has some semblance,
some shred of fact
that he might produce
in court.
Well, I get migraines.
Yeah, that's true.
But they've never interfered
with my ability to do anything.
You can talk to my doctor
about that.
He'll tell you they've
certainly never crippled me.
Um...
As for Ceci, I think she's
a little bit lonely right now.
Her father's abandoned her
and she was forced to move
from her neighborhood, so...
she's developed
an imaginary friend.
But that's normal.
That's fine.
But for future reference,
when you're talking to,
for example, a judge,
I would stay away from phrases like,
"her father's abandoned her."
It's important, when the other
side is being so melodramatic,
to sound like we're the sane ones.
Right.
That's all I'm saying.
OK.
I'd like to notch that.
Oh, yeah, man.
Hey. Hey, sweetheart.
Mommy?
Yeah.
Look what Daddy gave me.
Wow.
That's great.
You're so lucky.
Listen, next Saturday's
a problem.
Can we do Sunday
and I'll bring her here
first thing in the morning
for school on Monday?
Yeah. Yeah, that's fine.
Come on, honey.
Say bye to Daddy.
Bye, Daddy.
Thanks for the Barbie.
Did you do that ponytail by yourself?
Yeah.
It's a good one.
Thanks.
I like the collar.
Thanks.
Honey, you know what,
I forgot to do something.
I'm gonna be right back.
Will you wait right here for me?
Don't go anywhere, OK?
OK.
Be right back.
Two... one.
Ceci?
Ceci? Stay in the elevator.
I'm bringing you down.
Ceci, can you hear me?
Bake me a cake
as fast as you can.
Roll it, pat it
and mark it with a B.
No more pretending
to play with Natasha.
Well, then you stop talking to her.
You tell her I said so.
You tell her your mommy said you
can't play with her anymore.
OK, Mommy.
Hello?
Hi, Mr. Platzer.
I'm sorry to call you late,
but I think my husband...
Mrs. Williams, it's Sunday night.
I can't talk.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
I just need to tell you this
as soon as possible.
I think my husband
is trying to drive me crazy.
Either that or he's hoping
that I'm gonna act crazy.
Hang on. Let me call you right back.
OK.
You say neither of the Rimskys
are living there?
No, no one's there.
So Kyle's paying these kids.
I mean, he must be paying
these kidsto mess around
with the water and the backpack.
And the elevator.
I went into the elevator the other
day and the buttons were burned off.
Mrs. Williams, it's Sunday night and
I'm at the movies with my family.
If I don't want to be handling my
own divorce, I gotta get back.
So... I'll call you tomorrow
and we'll sort this out.
All right?
Yeah. Absolutely.
MAN: Get down!
This time make sure you put
it in the garbage truck.
Where did you fi--
Those kids have been playing games with it,
moving it around the building.
And they were upstairs again,
so now there's water
all over my bedroom floor.
They're running the water again?
Mm-hmm.
I thought you were gonna
change the lock on 10F.
Murray didn't authorize it.
He has to send me a 112B form.
Well, look, is the plumber here yet?
No.
No. It's only 8:15.
OK, look.
I left a message
for Mr. Murray.
I told him I need
my problem fixed first.
So when the plumber gets here,
send him up to my apartment
or you and Murray can both
talk to my lawyer. OK?
Do you remember what we
talked about last night?
Yes, Mommy.
OK.
See you later, OK?
DAHLIA: Hello.
Hi. Jeff Platzer here.
Hi, Mr. Platzer.
Listen, I did a little homework
on Rimsky
and I think I turned up the missing
mother in a hospital in San Diego.
I figured the Rimskys might want to know
their apartment is being used by strangers.
Mrs. Williams, we're never gonna prove
your husband's behind this harassment.
And trying to do that
is just playing his game.
He wants you to look paranoid.
We gotta deal with this straight,
as if it's all on the level.
So that's what we'll do,
we'll play it straight.
OK.
I'm due in court. I'll call you
when I get ahold of Mrs. Rimsky.
In the meantime,
just sit tight.
I will. Thanks so much.
OK.
Bye.
Bye.
Abigail's making a
storm, sweetheart. Done!
Done? You remember you have to sign
your name so you know whose it is.
You don't me to take that home
and say I did it, do you?
That's pretty good.
I like that. Pirates.
Pirates?
Stop it.
Stop it. I told you,
leave me alone.
We've got rainbows...
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
You're gonna get cleaned up
and when you're done
you're gonna come back
and sit with me
and we'll read a story
together.
And then maybe we'll talk
about your friend. OK?
Go on.
LITTLE GIRL:
Ceci!
Go away!
Where is she?
She passed out in the bathroom.
We don't know what happened.
There was water all over the place.
We took her to the hospital.
Hospital?
We just wanted to check her out.
It's school policy. We couldn't reach you.
I had an emergency at work.
I didn't get my messages for two hours.
It's all right.
We called her father and he's
gonna meet her at the hospital.
OK. Which hospital?
It's the one right here on the island.
Kyle took her.
They released her and he took her.
PLATZER: Did they say what
was wrong with her?
They said, you know, it's nothing
serious, that she fainted but...
I'm trying to find him.
I called his home number,
I called his cell phone number,
I called his office number,
and he's avoiding me,
so I need to know what to do.
Can I go to his apartment?
Mrs. Williams, I need you to calm down.
I need it, your daughter needs it.
Just calm down, OK?
I'm sorry.
I know you don't know me,
but you have to believe me.
I'm not crazy,
I'm really not.
I believe you, Mrs. Williams.
I'm really not.
Just go home. Your husband and your
daughter are probably waiting for you.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Ceci.
Ceci.
Oh, God.
Hello?
Hello? It's Jeff.
Are they there?
No.
They're not there?
No. There's no message.
There's water everywhere.
Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Williams,
calm down.Calm down.
She can't be here.
What do you want me to do?
Oh, God.
I can't be her mother,
I don't know how to be myself.
Ceci!
MOTHER: I hate you.
Get away from me, you little bitch.
Fuck!
I hate you! I hate you!
Bitch!
Sorry about this.
I really had no idea.
I would've come down myself
a long time ago.
Better open it.
Hello?
Jesus.
Look at this.
This is appalling. This is appalling.
The plumber's on his way.
I'm paying him double overtime
so he can get here tonight.
Hello?
I'll get some of these lights on.
Mrs. Williams?
You OK?
I'm awake.
The plumber will be here
in 15 minutes.
Mr. Murray?
This is just a big
misunderstanding. OK?
Mr. Veeck did not keep me informed.
This will be fixed tonight.
Or she's staying
at the Plaza, right?
It will definitely be
fixed tonight.
And I want to talk to Veeck.
I will get him.
You OK?
Migraine, huh?
Yeah.
I'll keep my voice low.
Thanks.
I spoke with your husband's
lawyer, and Ceci's fine.
Kyle will bring her to school
in the morning.
OK.
Now, this part is
gonna piss you off.
They want Ceci to see a
psychologist to be evaluated.
There's nothing we can do
about that but say yes.
So we're saying yes.
OK.
Well, here we are.
Mr. Veeck.
I had an interesting conversation
with Mrs. Rimsky today.
She was very surprised to hear her
daughter was living upstairs.
In 10F?
Mm-hmm.
You said they left together.
That's what the Russian said.
No, she left without her daughter.
She didn't think she could take care of her.
Mrs. Rimsky's an alcoholic.
She claimed she was going for treatment
and had to leave the girl
behind with the father.
You knew that, didn't you?
Only Mr. Rimsky didn't
take Natasha with him.
I spoke with Grandma Rimsky
in Moscow today,
and she said her son
is living with her alone.
So he lied to me.
What do I know?
You had to know.
Well, we'll find out tomorrow. I have
a phone appointment with Mr. Rimsky.
Why did you lie
about the little girl?
I didn't want to get involved,
that's all.
Did you see Natasha
after her mother left?
It's a simple question, Veeck.
Yeah. I see her.
I see her that afternoon.
I see her playing
on the stairs.
Then the next day the father tells
me she leave with the mother.
I ask no questions.
Well, if he killed her,
it's not my business.
He killed her?
If he killed her?
You got a lot more than a
leak to fix, Mr. Murray.
Mr. Veeck.
If you could just...
MURRAY: Come on in,
just right inside.
Thank you.
MURRAY: Some kind of pipe
or something.
Yeah, well, see,
that is a brand-new pipe.
So, this will all be patched tomorrow.
By professionals.
By professionals. Good as new.
It better be.
I'm calling NYPD to report
a child is missing.
OK. I mean, I'm sure there's a
simple explanation for that, but...
So, good night. Uh...
And, again, I am so sorry
about all this.
Good night.
Good night.
You gonna be OK?
Yeah.
I'll be fine.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm feeling
much better, actually.
I gotta go. Family.
OK. Mm.
I'll keep my cell on all night,
and if you need me just call.
Any hour.
Thanks.
Thanks again. Bye.
OK. Bye.
They both left you behind.
Wait!
I told Murray,
I told him a million times.
It's not my job.
I'm not a goddamn plumber.
How you feeling? You OK?
You warmed up?
I'm OK.
Cops think Veeck probably
left the tank open
and somehow she fell in.
They even think he might have
discovered she'd fallen in weeks ago.
That's why he hadn't
cleaned it in so long.
They might have enough to charge
him with criminal negligence.
They'd arrest the parents,
but they're out of state
and there are no witnesses,
so, you know ...
The truth is, they'll probably
never know what happened.
Her mother left her.
The father assumed
that she was with her mom,
and the mother assumed
she was with her father.
Guess everyone just assumed.
No one really cared
what happened to her.
That's what it looks like.
I'll tell Mary
you've been a prince.
You just accomplished the
impossible, Mrs. Williams.
You actually made me glad
I went to law school.
Thank you.
It's OK.
I can probably get you a year's
free rent out of Murray.
Oh. No, it's OK.
I'm moving.
Call me in the morning, OK?
Yeah.
Come on, princess.
Bye, Daddy.
Bye.
How are you feeling?
Good.
Yeah?
OK. I'll be here after school
to pick you up.
See you after school.
Hey.
Hi.
Thank you for taking care
of Ceci yesterday.
It's OK. I'm really worried
about her mental state.
I am too.
You are?
Yeah.
So, I've been thinking...
I don't want her to have
to choose between us.
What do you mean?
I want to look for
a place in Jersey City
so that shared custody will
be easier for both of us.
And we can do, you know, one week
with me and one week with you.
Or maybe split the week.
We can see what works best.
You serious?
Yeah. Yeah.
Hey, you know, you were right
about the school here.
I checked it out.
It's good.
Maybe I could get a place...
No, it's fine.
After this, we'll get a...
a place in Jersey City.
I'll see you later.
When are we moving?
Not until next week,
sweetheart.
This is winter stuff, though,
so we can pack it up now.
You OK?
Are you feeling OK?
What are you thinking about?
Why did her mommy
forget about her?
Do you know
how much I love you?
You sure?
Mm-hmm.
Do you know I would do
anything for you?
Yes.
That's a promise.
Honey, do you want bubbles tonight?
Uh-huh.
There you are.
MARY: That's so great,
Dahlia.
Well, I think it's
gonna be for the best.
And moving out of here, that
is definitely for the best.
What do you want to do?
Be a chef? OK.
Let's see if we can
make you a chef hat.
There.
Now, what are you
going to cook?
Mac and cheese?
Look, I should go get Ceci out of the
tub before she turns into a prune.
She's so cute.
So...
Oh! Here she is now.
Yeah. So I will talk
to you tomorrow.
OK. Take care. Bye.
OK. You too.
Mommy, can you read me
a story?
Course I can, honey.
Let's see
which one you picked.
We haven't read this one
in a long time, have we?
"There were once a man
and a woman
who had long in vain
wished for a child."
We need more snow,
don't you think?
Then let's get some more snow.
"...beautiful Rapunzel."
Don't leave me.
I want you to be my mommy.
Don't leave me.
Ceci!
You can't leave me.
Ceci!
Ceci!
Ceci!
Ceci!
Ceci!
No! Aah!
Ceci!
Ceci!
Ceci!
Oh, God.
Let her go! You let her go!
No!
No! Please!
Natasha! Let her go!
Please.
We'll stay.
We'll stay here with you.
What do you want?
I'll be your mother.
Please.
Forever?
Forever.
Forever. Yes.
I'll be your mother forever.
Take me. Please take me.
DISPATCHER: Yeah, OK.
So we got an 11-46,
Caucasian female, aged 30,
no apparent cause of death,
and a six-year-old girl
with shock.
Ceci.
Let's go home, honey.
Would you get the door?
DAHLIA: We did a whole bunch
of them. A whole neighborhood.
What was this one about?
Do you remember?
That was me
and then that was you.
That was a tree.
A tree.
And then that's
a little angel.
Beautiful gold wings
on the angel.
Come on.
OK, honey, let's walk.
What's wrong with you?
Come on.
Ce--
Ceci? Ceci?
Open the door.
Push the button, Ceci.
Open the...
open the door. Ceci!
My beautiful girl.
Whenever you need me, I'm here.
OK, Daddy. Let's go.
