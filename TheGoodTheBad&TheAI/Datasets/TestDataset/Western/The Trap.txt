She is already paid for, so
highest bidder takes her.
Now she's not young, but she's sound of limb

My friend ...

Come see what I've got for you.

These should sell high in San Francisco.
- Aha, with the rest of the money you've saved for me.
I'll be rich man, ah,

I'll have money to buy new rifle.
enough money to buy myself a woman too...
..eh, Baptiste?
Rifle good.
Rifle..

You don't believe me?
No!
Listen to me...
when Jean La Bete
say he has money..
..he has money.
I'll never be able to
play this thing, never.
All right Sarah, you may read
for us now.
Yes, mother.
We must find someone to
give you lessons.
Perhaps the Captain can bring a teacher back
with him on his next trip.
Though I speak with the tongues of
men and of angels..
and have not charity
I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.
And though I have the gift of prophecy ...
Who is there?
Hey my friend, I was looking for you.
I want my money.
How dare you come bursting
in here like this?
My God ...
I wished I had a woman like you.
Next year ...
next year, whenI have
a woman like you ...
..maybe I buy one of
these too,um?
Sarah, go upstairs at once.
Maybe I buy you, um?
and you bring it with you.
Now who are you? What do you want?
My money.
- I come to get it.
- But you don't need it tonight.
That kanuk Baptiste ....
..he call me a liar.
We will see, huh?
What money? What does he mean?
- I can tell him that you have it, it's the same thing.
- No.
Oh no, kanuk like Baptiste
beleive only with their eyes.
Oh, is drunk, give him what
he wants and get rid of him.
- What are you doing? That's ours.
- I know what I'm doing.
- But that's for our passage to San Francisco.
- That's next year.
- $ 1000, and that includes today's furs.
- But you can't do this!
Now that kanuk can
eat his words, no?
Hum?
He will see that I have enough money
to buy a woman.
You're a good friend.
Eh.
No!
Little rabbit!
Get back to the kitchen!
You must have something to say for yourself.
The money was his, I had to
give it back to him.
He left it with me for safe keeping.
I was told that he was dead.
But you've given him gold
from our own savings!
- You have to make it up first thing tomorrow morning!
- I can't make it up!
What do you mean...you can't make it up?
I mean all the money
we have is there!
What are you talking about? There is money
at the trading post.
- The safe is empty!
- Empty!
- But you'll be paid for your furs tomorrow!
- Yes, with money I owe already!
But you can borrow, you can get credit!
Credit, I have no more
credit, understand, none!
Our only chance to get out of here
and you've given it away.
To a filthy trapper
- The money was his!
To an animal!
A wild animal!
I may be many things,
But I am not a thief!
And what about Sarah? How is she
ever goint to find a decent husband now?
There are men here as good
as any of the men in San Francisco!
Here ... Go!
- Well, sell that damn thing!
- Never!
We have the right to nice things!
We have a right to something.
Wait here.
The water is cold.
Last night you said you wanted a woman.
If you wait for the Captain to bring you one
it'll take a year, you know that, don't you?
I can get one today ...
- A thousand dollars.
- A thousand dollars?
She's never been to prison.
She is not the kind of trash
the Captain brings up here.
And she's never known another maaan ...
You can have her if you take her away now.
Alright, child.
Her parents were killed
in an indian raid ten years ago.
My husband found her and brought
her home to live with us.
What's your name, little rabbit?
Speak to me ...
- I'm talking to you!
- She can't speak,
shock,
but she's a good strong girl,
she cooks well and she sews too.
Her name is Eve.
A thousand dollars for a woman
who can't talk?
That's a lotta money.
- Better than a woman who talks too much.
- Huh?
Here, take.
Stay!
"When I'm a man
I'll take me a wife;
"We will live in a house
on the hill, the hill; "
Hey woman
My mother taught me that song.
My mother ...
"With carriage and horses, all

"And she will have diamond

"And she will have diamond and pearls."
Go get wood,

Hey, rabbit!
Where are you going little rabbit, huh?
In the forest at night ...
keep close to fire ...
saver from wolf, bear ...

Why you not eat?
Indians say bear meat

Eat!
Tomorrow ...

You'll pay!
Pull it up!!
Pull !
Here, work make you warm.

Stand still.
Don't worry;..

Take these inside, make fire.
Woman,

I get some meat.
Put the roof on here, to
keep the snow out
the bait here
on a nail in the hole in the tree.
The martin run up the pole across the trap
to get the meat ...
...he's caught.
This got poor smell
but eyes like a hawk.
here,
when he sees the wing flapping, he's wondering
what's happend, so he come across..
..he sees fat old bird and
smell here the old perfume..
..made from rotten dead fish,
then, wanting dinner..
..step over these sticks here..
You see that cross?
..he's put his foot actoss the top.
Little rabbit.

always uses the same path,
like sheep...
..so wolf come here too..
..looking for sheep who is
sick or hurt maybe...
Fat here..
..then the blade..
..put the blade in the fat.
When the wolf bite the fat
he cut his tongue so he howl ...
loud, then the other wolfs
hear him so they come quick,
then they smell the blood,
tear him to pieces..
..then  each other.
Sometime maybe one lump of fat
will kill five wolf,that's good for me.
don't have to kill so many.
Damn bear Adam, see, trap sprung.
Bait half gone.
Now he is in some cave somewhere
laughing at us.
Jean La Bete still smarter than him though.
First, more bait
Up there in the tree, not on the ground
where fox and wolf can steal 'em first.
Here.
Here!
Tie 'em on tight.
Come on women, by the time you finish
old Adam be down here eat the bait,
trap, fox, you and me.
Soon I teach you everything
about trapping,
then you won't need
Jean Le Bete no more, umm.
I will make surprise
for old Adam bear.
Put all these small trap,
..around the big one here, see?
then the old bear come down the path,
put his foot in the  small trap..
bang..he's caught.
so he does a dance, around here
to get his toe loose..

This winter that damn old bear will
find out who run the forest.

Smarter than us I think.
They only come here when

And last winter ...
last winter was very long.
Eve.
Come here.
Please.
Eve.
You never talk ...
Jean La Bete sometimes forgets
that you have a name.
Eve,
is a good name too.
If it were not for Eve ...
Then Jean La Bete would be dead.
When there was nothing but pain..
..she was there to comfort him.
And when ...
when the cold snow come and ..
and the cabin froze,
...then she was there
to keep him warm.
and to feed him.

Someone who won't make him feel
ashamed beacuse he wants to be married!
Eve.
Eve ... ¡!
When we got her home she lay abed
other two months,
still as death.
It was like ...
something in her heart had gone dead.
Something we couldn't touch.
And she lost the child she was carrying.
We nearly lost her
her, too.
I never thought we'd see her wed.
Ah, poor child.
The wife's making
her wedding dress.
The least she can do, I guess.
Eve.
Still can't believe it.
this time tomorrow..
we will be starting a
whole new life together,
you and me,
and one day,
one day you just watch,
we'll have a big white house on Knob Hill,
with a chandelier to hang in every
room.
We will,
you'll see.
I love you Evie.
Evie.
Have you ever really shot it, ?
I mean really at bear or
something like that ?
I bet you have.
And I bet you lived in a
real log cabin too, didn't you?
Just you and him, all alone
in the middle of the forest.
That must be how you lived.
And it must have been terribly cold too.
I bet it was, wasn't it?
What on earth did you eat?
I mean you can't eat raw meat all the time.
That's enough.
But suppose he comes right in
the middle of the preacher marring them.
He won't be comming.
- Is he really dead, Evie, is he?
- I said that's enough.
Perhaps she killed him herself
You did Evie?
Please let us know, I mean nobody
would blame you, not for killing him.
Sarah, enough!
But I want to know!
Did you kill him, Evie?
Please let us know!
Did you, did you,
did you, did you?
Will you be quiet?
All right.
My husband will come and fetch you
in a few minutes.
Is she allright?
All right?
