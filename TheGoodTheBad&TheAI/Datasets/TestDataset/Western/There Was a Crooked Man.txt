Lord, for what we are about to receive...
...make us properly grateful. Amen.
- Amen.
Nothing like fried chicken
while it's still hot and crispy.
The quicker you open that safe
and give us the money...
...the quicker you can get back
to that tasty-looking chicken.
Safe?
You're mistaken, son.
There's no safe in this house.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Wayne, you'd better do like he says.
A man works like a nigger all his life
to get ahead.
Some bastard just comes along
and takes it from him.
It's just a few pennies I put aside
for a rainy day.
You got enough there for a flood,
Mr. Lomax.
Damn. Must be a million dollars.
Mrs. Lomax.
Saddlebag isn't gonna be big enough.
Well, Hobbs, get something bigger.
It just ain't the same when it gets cold.
Is this all right?
Those were my mother's.
Must have been a fine figure of a woman.
Don't feel so bad, Mr. Lomax...
...you got rich once, you can do it again.
Think of it as a kind of a challenge.
That's all of it.
I do hate to eat and run like this.
What are you doing here?
Get out there and help.
You ain't gonna get your ass shot off
for no white man's money.
Come on, upsy-daisy, girls.
Come on, girls. Look lively.
Come on, now. Brighten up.
Why, look who's here.
- Good evening, Goldie.
Oh, you poor man, you're all wet.
And drunk.
- Well, come on in. You'll catch your death.
I got no business here, Goldie.
Being, as you know, cleaned out.
Oh, honey, we all heard about that.
It's just terrible, just terrible.
I thought if I could just sit down for a while.
Oh, why, sure.
An old customer like you...
Friday nights just ain't been the same
without you.
All that money.
It's just hell.
Even my poor parrot.
He's gone clean out of his mind
since that night.
Oh, honey, you'll be back on your feet
before long.
Look, I tell you what.
How would you like to go upstairs
and have a look through the peephole?
But-- But doesn't that cost
almost as much as--?
We'll put it on the house.
Evening, Wayne.
- Evening, judge.
You're late. Just missed the fireworks.
By God.
By God!
It's him!
By God, it's him!
It's him!
By God, it's him!
It's him!
It's him!
It's him!
By God, it's him!
Society has got to be protected
against the likes of you.
Paris Pitman Jr., having been
found guilty of armed robbery...
...you're hereby sentenced to 10 years
in the territorial prison.
This time I caught you, you little bastard!
- This time?
You all through
messing around with my daughter.
I told her what I was gonna do.
By God, this time I'm gonna do it!
Daddy, thank God you came in.
But I just met her tonight. Tell him!
Bull.
It was the Good Friday of 1873.
I was asleep in my sinner's bed.
Not alone, I gotta admit.
And suddenly,
a bolt of lightning struck the air!
And a strange white light filled my room.
And I heard the voice of our blessed Lord.
And he said:
'Cyrus.'
And I said:
'That's me, Lord.'
And he said,
'I want you to do my work.'
And I fell to my knees and cried:
'What shall I do, Lord?'
And he said:
'From this minute on, you're gonna preach
the gospel of holding out a helping hand...
...to the less fortunate in our midst.'
Good people of Deuteronomy...
...how many of you here today
count your blessings...
...because you or your loved ones
are not deprived...
...of two or more of your natural senses?
Dudley.
Dudley!
As you see, poor Dudley
cannot hear a word I say.
He must read my lips.
Dudley, go to the easel.
Folks, keep your eyes on this poor man
with the mind of a backward boy.
He cannot utter the simplest word.
He cannot hear the loudest sound.
Dudley there was born a mongolian idiot.
A common mule had more reason
for being in this world.
But the hand of Providence...
...guided this stray lamb
to the Calvary Mission...
...where his remarkable talents
began to blossom.
Thank you, ma'am.
Bless you, ma'am. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Every little offering helps. Thank you.
I thank you, friends, I thank you.
Your unbounded generosity will be known
all the way to Racine, Wisconsin.
In gratitude for your kindness...
...the Calvary Mission
for the deaf and dumb...
...would like to present to you...
...Dudley's beautiful rendition
of Moses and the burning bush.
And I take great pleasure in handing over
this inspirational subject...
...on your behalf
to United States Marshal Johnson.
Jumping Jesus, my heinie!
My heinie's on fire!
My heinie's on fire!
You sleep late.
- I work late.
That's why I'm here.
Make it easy on yourself.
If you stay in town, I'll have to arrest you.
There'll be a trial, you'll get six months.
I guarantee it.
On the other hand,
I'll give you two hours to get out.
Sheriff.
Maybe we could talk this over.
Now you've got one hour.
Robbed, I just got. In broad daylight.
Who did it?
- Robber, who else?
He went into the saloon.
Floyd Moon.
Floyd, you're in a little trouble.
Don't make it worse.
Give me your gun.
Come on, Floyd. Hand over your gun.
Your gun, Floyd.
I want you to give it to me.
Sure, sheriff. Anything you say.
All right, out.
Get out of there!
All right, one, two, three,
four, five, six, follow me.
Welcome to the territorial prison,
gentlemen.
I shall assume
we all have one thing in common:
A burning desire to be elsewhere.
But we're not.
My name is Francis E. LeGoff.
I'm your warden.
None of you has been particularly adept
at living according to the rules...
...on the outside. You'll do better here.
Yes?
- He's just got phlegm, Your Honor.
The rules then: No singing, no whistling.
Any man who can walk
works on the rock pile.
All prisoners are required
to attend the hangings.
Coy Cavendish.
Yes, sir?
The date for your hanging
has not yet been set.
In the meantime, obey the rules.
Yes, sir.
Which one is Paris Pitman?
Junior?
Junior.
They're ready for you, warden.
Right this way, gents.
Is everybody here?
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Over here!
That's it. Now, just follow me.
Looks like you boys
are gonna be cellmates.
Got a nice, big cell for you.
Only one feller in it.
What's he like?
He's the Missouri Kid.
- The Missouri Kid?
One of the greatest train robbers
that ever lived.
One of the greatest.
- There must've been a hell of a bounty.
One of the biggest.
How do you do there?
You can call me Kid.
All right, Kid. My name's Paris.
This one here's mine.
You're welcome to the rest.
Get out of that bed, Dudley.
You know I gotta sleep low.
Finders, keepers. You take the top one.
Now, you know I got a bad heart.
I'm not allowed to do any climbing.
Horse manure.
There's nothing wrong with you.
I said, I got a bad heart,
you son of a bitch!
You fat-ass old bully.
Hey, Kid...
...you been here a long time?
- Always.
Hey, you must be that Chinaman.
I heard tell he wrung the neck off
some other Chink in a railway gang.
If it was a white man,
they'd have strung him up on the spot.
What about you?
I-- I pulled three years.
What about you, son?
- Two.
Because he cried in front of the judge.
You should've seen him
sniveling like a street whore.
Fish piss. If it hadn't been for me,
you'd have got more, fraud.
You must know an awful lot
about what goes on here, I bet.
Excuse me. Where's the gents'?
He's got his foot on it.
I say, you must know an awful lot
about what goes on here.
You ain't pulled much time
in the pokey, have you, son?
If you want something, you'll pay for it.
I'll pay my way.
Hey, Tobaccy!
Listen, every spindle in this place
has a dodger game.
This one here is Tobaccy.
He sells you, like, cigarettes and plug.
Another one is Whiskey.
And then there's Sweets.
You ain't got a fella here
named Poontang, have you?
Yeah?
- What's the going rate?
Five tailor-mades for a dollar.
- Go and pay the man.
All right. Start asking.
How many ever bust out of here?
Now, don't ponder on that,
it'll just weaken your mind.
How many?
Well, none that lived to tell about it.
What time do they change the guards?
And where?
It's always different times
and different places.
And it's never all at once.
They don't miss a trick.
Those on the front gate,
always the same number on top? Below?
Believe me, sooner or later
you're gonna give up.
Son, let me tell you something.
It'll help you make your time here.
About 25 years ago...
...when I seen I wasn't ever
gonna get out of this place...
...I said to myself, 'Kid,' I said:
'Kid, you better figure out some way
to keep from going cuckoo.'
Well, you know,
I tried this and I tried that.
And then one day, like, sudden-like,
it come to me.
A way to bust out of here.
No. There ain't no way out.
No, listen. I thunk me up a farm.
I mean, not a big place, it--
There's no more than 25 acres,
but it's real good land.
And now when things get too tough
around here for me...
...I just close my eyes...
...and I farm that land.
Well, anyway, I was thinking, son...
...if you was to get yourself--
Get yourself a farm, a store or something...
...why, it would help you to pass the time.
It'd give you something--
Give you something to think about.
Thanks, Kid,
but I got something to think about.
All right, get to work!
Hey, hey, come on!
Chop, chop, chop.
We thought some little, bitty ones
might come in handy.
You see, there's this shoulder wound
I got at Gettysburg.
I was just a kid.
Name.
- Cavendish.
First name.
- Coy.
Coy.
Maybe we can find
something easier for you to do.
Let's talk about it sometime.
Hey! Hey! Come on! Hit it! Hey, hey!
Hit it!
Oh, my God, how will I live through this?
I've got the chilblains all over.
I can feel my consumption coming back.
The one you caught at Gettysburg?
How can you eat that?
Oh, this ain't that bad.
It ain't as good as my cooking.
It'll be a long time
before you get anything that good again.
You got some gall to talk like that.
If you hadn't backed your butt
into that stove...
You put me here,
just like you'll be the death of me!
Fish piss.
It's no one's fault we're here but yours.
If you'd have listened,
we could've had a nice little house...
...you could've got a decent job and gone
to work the way that other men do.
I'd have cooked and cleaned
and worked my fingers to the bone.
But, oh, no, no, no. That wasn't
good enough for you, Mr. Big-Ideas.
'Just one more dodge.
Make a million. Easy money.'
Everything I did, I was only thinking of us.
- Lies.
Of you!
- Lies, lies, lies. Just a pack of lies.
I'm coming down with something.
- Yeah.
Consumption, I tell you.
- Yeah.
My lungs are gonna go ahead of my heart.
- Have consumption.
I don't care what part of you goes first.
Your name Paris Pitman?
- Yeah.
Junior?
- That's me.
Hey.
Hey, now, hold it.
Now, what's the trouble?
Why don't we talk about this?
You sure you got the right man?
Let's be reasonable.
That's it.
I've known Woody Lopeman for 15 years.
I'd give him the shirt off my back...
...but that don't mean
I'll let this town go down the drain.
Hold on there, Harry. It ain't like he was
an out-and-out cripple. He's doing his job.
The way I see it,
it's about time we got us a sheriff...
...who can treat that jailhouse scum
like they was meant to be.
What do you mean by that?
- Face up to it, Billy.
He always did mollycoddle those bastards.
Christ, look at how he got it. Asking
a robber to hand his gun over to him.
I don't care what the man's style is.
He kept this town clean and quiet.
He did his job good.
That's exactly what I'm trying to tell you.
He did his job, but he can't do it no more.
Doc, now, you know I'm right.
Can a sheriff with a busted-up limb
do his job? For my money he's...
Thought the two of us
were gonna have a talk.
I can't wait forever.
Things can get tougher, you know.
They can also get easier too.
It's up to you.
Go to hell!
What was that?
- He said, 'Go to hell.'
Get to work!
This could be the beginning
of something big.
Such as what?
Such as we could be
running this place pretty soon.
They just must not like your face.
They keep trying to change it.
There's got to be a reason, Kid.
Somebody's got to have
something in mind.
Yeah, but whatever it is,
they're playing it close to the vest.
I couldn't find out nothing.
So, what are you gonna do?
Well, for one thing,
I've gotta get me some help.
Six to two he spits in your eye.
You got a bet.
Cabbage. My ma would have to whip me
before I'd eat it.
Well, I guess it's a matter of taste.
I notice you happen to like it. I hate it.
Here. Take mine.
I been watching you, Floyd.
What's going on inside you?
Nobody knows but you. Smart.
Real smart.
I hear you shot it out with a sheriff.
Cut him down to size, I hear, huh?
That's a pretty feisty thing to do,
if you did it.
I bet there ain't a man in this yard
with your guts.
If you did it.
Well...
I was--
I was drunk.
And I still beat him to the draw, by God.
Ain't that something?
You must be the goddamnedest shot
in this territory.
Just one of the best.
- A sheriff?
He must have been crazy
to tangle with you.
Well--
- Must have been a pretty big job.
Hey, you don't shoot a sheriff
if he caught you spitting on the floor.
I've had my share of the big ones, all right.
Big jobs, big outfits. The best, right?
That's right. They had to be.
You're only as good as your worst man.
Well, me, I never could afford to be choosy
who I had on my side.
I'd wind up with some of the worst
lamebrains you ever saw.
You know, this time in Nogales, we--
- Hey, four-eyes.
This time in Nogales,
there was this little bank--
Hey, four-eyes!
We're tired of coming to you.
This time you come to us,
you yellow bastard.
All right, come on, break it up. Get back.
Come on, get back. Come on.
Nice work, son.
- Pitman.
Pitman.
The warden wants to see you.
What the hell is this?
In here, Pitman.
Warden.
You have $500,000 hidden somewhere...
...and it isn't doing you any good.
Son of a bitch.
So that's what somebody had in mind.
Pitman, what sort of man
do you think I am?
I don't know. Hadn't thought
about it much, to tell the truth.
Not a happy one, I can tell you.
Does that surprise you?
Nothing surprises me.
The truth is, I find the atmosphere
of this place stifling, depressing, boring.
I'm sure you feel the same,
though perhaps not for the same reasons.
Keep talking, sir.
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
would do me very nicely.
I could go abroad,
perhaps Mexico, live happily.
You help me to escape
and I'll do the same for you.
Not a bad bargain.
- Not a good one, warden.
That's half the money.
You'd like to keep it all.
Am I being selfish?
Your first few weeks here
have been difficult.
I'm not much good to you dead, warden.
- Perhaps not.
Still, life is full of surprises.
So keep an open mind,
you never can tell.
No. No, I don't like having
my mind too open.
It makes it easier,
once you get around to changing it.
I tell you, it was all I could do
to keep from pitching in.
But the truth is, I once killed a man
with old Mary Ann here.
Mary Ann was his mother's name.
Judas Priest.
Solitary?
Hey, Tobaccy.
Give him these for me, will you?
I owe him.
Come on, Kid, you know he's not allowed.
- They're gonna be his last!
Hey, Kid. What are you gonna do
with that when it gets ripe?
Smoke it, you silly son of a bitch.
What else?
Smoke it?
Cyrus, I just can't figure it.
What's Skinner got against the boy?
Oh, for God's sakes, Dudley.
Could've had it so easy.
Who threw that?
- He did.
Come on, you guys.
Come on, you dumb bastards, move!
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it, you hear? Stop it!
Stop them! Get in there and stop them,
you Chink son of a bitch!
What are you doing? Stop it.
Let go of me. Let go of me, you Chi--
Sir.
Tell your commanding officer
the new warden's here.
This place is bigger than I thought it'd be.
Mr. Lopeman.
- Colonel Wolff.
Well, I'm not sorry to see you.
Things seem quiet enough now.
The last man I heard say that
was General Custer.
What's that gonna be?
Well, that was supposed to be
new quarters for the warden.
What was wrong with the old ones?
The last warden just wanted
something bigger.
And I guess he got it.
Look here.
They told me something
and I just couldn't believe it.
Did you ask for this job?
That's right.
But nobody asks to be warden
of this prison, Mr. Lopeman.
Even Daniel didn't wanna walk
into the lions' den.
These aren't animals, colonel.
You could've fooled me.
I'm your new warden.
My name's Lopeman.
You've all raised a lot of hell last week.
Here's what it got you:
Six dead, and you're still here.
From now on, if something's bothering you,
come tell me about it.
I mean that. Tell me first.
That's all. Eat your breakfast now.
What's this?
- It's solitary, sir.
How long has he been here?
- Ten days, sir.
Get him to the doctor.
There ain't none.
This one?
- It's the longest. Three weeks.
Well, you must be the new warden.
What the hell is this?
Come in. Come in.
Cigar, warden?
Compliments of the old warden.
Don't smoke. Drink, maybe?
Don't drink.
Well...
...I guess you wanna hear the truth.
- It would help.
Well, maybe you ain't heard,
but I got 500,000--
Thousand, that is.
- -dollars in U.S. legal currency...
...hid in a hole somewhere in this territory.
Nobody knows where but me.
Now, the man who used to have your job
got to brooding on it after a time...
...as I expect you will and...
Well, I'll save you the trouble
and tell you what we was gonna do.
After four weeks of solitary,
it's enough to kill any man.
I was supposed to break.
You know, start yelling like,
'All right, all right, get me out of here.
I'll tell you where I hid the money.
But the only person I'll tell it to
is the governor himself, face to face.'
Sounds like something out of
one of them dime novels, don't it?
Well, anyway, here's the ticket.
Warden LeGoff
was gonna take me out of here...
...under his guard, to see the governor.
Well, me being such
an important desperado, see?
Only thing, on the way to the capital...
...we was gonna drop by
and visit with my money.
Split it down the middle...
...hightail it to Mexico.
Live like kings.
But...
...as it turned out, Warden LeGoff
has gone on to a far greater reward.
Which is just about the luckiest thing
that ever happened to you.
Back to the rock pile, right?
You guessed it.
Warden.
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Thank you for everything, colonel.
I'll be seeing you again.
- I hope so.
The way it works around this prison,
I generally see wardens only once.
Somebody in this pokey
must have an idea how to bust out.
Forget it, son.
For $500,000,
there's got to be a first time.
Five hundred thousand?
And whoever comes up
with a way, you split with him.
You're quick, Cyrus.
Can you keep your mouth shut?
- He can't.
I got it! I got it, I tell you.
- Well, let it out.
Easy. A tunnel out of here.
Ten feet down, 50 feet out, and we're free
and clear on the other side of the wall.
Now, you hold it right there.
You'll do your three years
and we'll walk out of here.
You know my heart can't take
three years in this place!
It ain't your heart that's weak,
it's your head!
Turn it off, turn it off.
It'd take you three years to dig the tunnel.
Then where would you be?
On the other side of the wall?
I wanna get a lot further than that.
Right, Coy?
Anyway, start smelling around,
and don't forget one thing.
I'm putting my trust in all of you
to keep quiet.
Like asking a pack of coyotes
to keep quiet about a dead horse.
We've already got more stone
than we can use for the new building.
Starting now, there'll be no work
in this quarry except for punishment.
You'll all return to the yard,
where you'll be assigned new jobs.
That man there will remain on the rock pile.
Warden, I figure by now, every man
in this prison knows about my 500,000.
Yep. Yeah,
they'll be laying awake nights.
Each one trying to bust me out of here
to get his share.
Well, you had your chance.
Pitman, come over here.
Between this place and the nearest town...
...there's 50 miles of crap and cactus.
One man on the loose out there...
You're too smart for that.
Paris Pitman's in your cell.
- So?
He's got a notion of escaping.
- Does he?
You know he does, Moon. We all do.
- Do we?
Goddamn it, sit down.
I'm not saying you know
what he's gonna do.
Probably doesn't know that himself yet.
When he makes up his mind,
you'll know about it a lot sooner than I will.
I will?
You'll get paid.
Hell, Moon, you've done it before.
You sold out gangs
to every sheriff in the territory.
That's how you made your living.
You've done it for me. Remember Simmons?
That was different.
I never could stand Simmons.
He was a mean son of a bitch.
And all the others before him?
I didn't care about them neither.
- But you do care about Pitman.
Do you think he's your friend?
Yeah.
I guess that's what he is.
A friend.
So you finally found one.
That's all. Go back to your cell.
Step it up, boys. Step it up.
Paris, whatever that is that you're drawing,
you can see it clear across the yard.
Hey, you three down there!
What's all that talk about?
Oh, just trying to get this whitewash
the right shade, captain.
Them buzzards on that wall
don't miss a trick, do they?
Pick it up.
Pick it up, you stupid Chink!
Pick it up!
What's going on?
Goddamn Chiney won't move.
What's troubling you, Ah-Ping?
Come on down, talk about it.
Ah-Ping, hold it!
Warden, don't you move a muscle.
Ah-Ping, put it down.
Put it down.
Put it down, Ah-Ping.
Now, come on down.
Come on.
Come on down.
Why don't you go back to the cell
and take it easy?
See you in my quarters after supper.
Yes, sir.
Pitman, this afternoon,
why'd you do that?
Just wanted to see if I could.
I ask you in here to say thanks,
and you smart-mouth me.
Oh, is that why you asked me here?
I'm gonna tell you something.
It doesn't make a damn bit of sense to me,
but those men look up to you.
What does that mean to you?
Oh, maybe an extra cup of coffee,
a few cigarettes.
Don't you give a damn what you mean
to them? What you can do for them?
So long, warden.
I'll see you around the yard.
Why do you work at it so hard,
proving to yourself you're a son of a bitch?
Because I am. It's my profession.
And I'm at the top.
Top of a prison yard.
- Not for long.
It's not so easy being a leader of men, is it?
Pitman.
Those men out there are filthy as hogs.
Can't you at least get them to take a bath?
Missouri Kid, you're next.
- No!
There's a limit, damn it!
A man's got his pride!
Come on, Kid, everybody's
gotta take a bath once in his life.
I ain't gonna do it!
I ain't gonna get in there!
Soap and water ain't gonna kill you.
It's the idea of the thing! It's humiliating!
- Go on. Get.
I'll give you 10 smokes.
I'll give you 15 smokes.
Paris. Twenty. Twenty specials.
Now, don't-- Stop that!
Twenty-five. Special!
Listen. I've had this thing on for 35 years...
...and you're not gonna
get me out of it now!
Oh, for God's sakes,
leave them on, Paris!
It's the only way they're gonna get washed!
Kid, we all gotta go sometime.
Oh, my God.
This is worse than I thought.
Hey, cut that out, Kid.
No peeing in the water.
