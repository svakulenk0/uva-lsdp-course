Walker's forces
will never slip away to the rear.
His men would rather die first.
Be prepared to sacrifice yourself
for freedom...
for justice,
for religious convictions!
Stand up and fight!
Fight, you pigheaded bastards!
Fight!
What the hell are you doing?
Get back in!
Shit. Aw, fuck.
Brigade! Atten-hut!
Men of
the 1 st Independence Battalion.
We came to Sonora with the boldest hearts
and the loftiest of intentions.
But I will not dissemble with you.
Reinforcements have failed to arrive.
We are without food or water.
We're trapped.
Only an act of God
can save us now.
Crocker, prepare the men for departure.
We're returning home.
Yes, sir! Mr. Fry, follow me.
This is a magnificent moment for me.
It is a privilege to be at your side
at this great time.
Even if we are defeated,
it doesn't matter.
We will live on in history.
Don't be so silly, man.
- Order! Order!
-  Hold it down. Hold it down.
- Quiet!
-
I demand quiet!
Yes, Your Honor.
Unless a man believes that there is
something great for him to do...
he can do nothing great.
It is the God-given right
of the American people...
to dominate the western hemisphere.
It is our moral duty to protect our neighbors
from oppression and exploitation.
-
- It is the fate of America...
- To go ahead.
-
- That is her manifest destiny.
-
- Walker!
- Yeah!
Your Honor...
we find the defendant,
William Walker...
Not guilty.
- Not guilty.
-
Hey!
-
- **
Only by expanding can we hope
to avoid a civil war...
and save those institutions
we hold most dear.
I assume you're including slavery?
My sentiments entirely, Mr. Squier.
Pardon me?
Miss Martin says that perhaps not all
of our institutions are worth saving.
Well, perhaps not.
However,
I'm sure the little lady will agree...
that we must preserve
our way of life at any cost!
-
-
Pardon me? I didn't get that.
Miss Martin has
a rather different view.
She positions herself
rather on the side of change...
rather than cultural preservation.
Well, that is very interesting, my dear.
Ellen. Please, Ellen!
Ellen!
I'm afraid she's not herself.
The strain of my recent trial.
Plus our approaching marriage.
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.
Doctor, will you please take care of our guests?
Yes, William.
Gentlemen! The renowned Walker
has prepared a statement...
in the form of a quote
from President Buchanan.
"Expansion is the future
of our country...
and only cowards fear
and oppose it."
Mr. Walker has no plans
for the moment...
except to pursue
his private affairs in peace.
Well...
Ellen.
Ellen. You know I despise...
I despise slavery!
Colonel Walker,
I'm so pleased to see you.
I can't tell you how happy
this will make the commodore.
Give him some water,
would you, please?
Every day he's been asking,
"When will Colonel Walker arrive?"
- Is my horse gonna be safe with that man?
- Yes, he'll be fine.
You have been very much
on his mind.
Central America, Colonel.
There's land, and all of it
there for the taking.
Think of it, sir.
From ocean to ocean.
This way.
And the women, Colonel.
Think of it.
Seven to every man.
If you please.
By the way, Colonel, have you had
an opportunity to read my book...
on the subject of Nicaragua?
No, I have not.
Well, then I will present you with
a signed first edition when next we meet.
It's my understanding you were educated
in Edinburgh, Scotland and Paris, France.
- That is correct.
- Good. The commodore likes an educated man.
And there he is,
the most powerful man on earth.
Do not sit unless he invites you to,
always address him as "commodore"...
and, under no circumstances,
ask for any personal favors.
Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt,
may I present Colonel William Walker?
- Colonel of what?
- The American phalange in northern Mexico.
You caused quite a commotion
down there.
We had a shortage of supplies, no help from our
government. Otherwise we would have succeeded.
You fucked up, Walker.
Next time pick on a country your own size.
Are you entitled
to wear that uniform?
I'm entitled to do
anything I want.
I did not come here to be insulted.
If you'll excuse me.
Sit down!
Please. Colonel, please.
Sit down.
- Does Nicaragua mean anything to you, Walker?
- Nothing at all.
Nicaragua's a fucked-up little country
somewhere south of here.
But in order to continue to do so...
I need stability.
What's this got to do with me?
Nicaragua's a divided country, sir.
It is in the midst of a terrible
civil war. It is imperative...
What I need is for some man
to go down there and take over.
I want that country stable.
I want it done now.
They, uh... They tell me
you're a clever man, Walker.
Doctor, lawyer, surgeon.
All that Renaissance rubbish
they talk about these days.
That's not the issue.
I plan to get married...
Then you would be wasting one
of life's golden moments, sir.
It is not every man who is offered
the chance to have a country of his own.
Walker's goals involve a higher purpose
than the vulgar pursuit of personal power.
Huh.
Do you prize democracy, Walker?
Universal suffrage?
The principles of our founding fathers?
Yes.
More than my own life.
Nicaragua needs democracy, Walker.
They need a canal as well.
I'm interested in Nicaragua, Walker,
and so are you...
whether you know it now or not.
Well, I'm sorry,
but I cannot oblige you.
- Good day.
- Now, Walker.
-
- I like him.
Get him a new hat.
- It was the cholera.
-
- Ellen.
-
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
She's with God now, my son.
Don't talk to me about God!
What do you know about God?
Get out!
-
- All of you, out! Get out!
How? How?
Oh, God!
I can't.
I don't... God, you bitch!
-
-
-
- Prepare to cast off!
late of the Corsican campaign
and the Balkan fiasco!
I am well-schooled
in military matters, sir...
I would be honored, sir,
if you would accept my services.
I will, of course, provide for my own needs
and will require no financial assistance.
What is your name again, sir?
Lieutenant... Uh, Captain
Siegfried Henningson at your command, sir!
- You are now Major Henningson.
-
Cast off then!
- My brother, William Walker.
- How do you do, sir?
- Aw, come on!
- Ow! My hair!
- Join the crowd.
- Jesus, stand up straight.
Start drumming, Mr. Turley.
* Oh, my darling Clementine *
- * You are lost and gone forever *
-
* Dreadful sorry, Clementine **
-
-
-
-
-
- What are you doing?
- Move it!
- * Fare thee well, fare thee well **
You're on my shit list, Washburn.
Get up there.
Get over here, goddamn it!
- Listen up here!
-
Proverbs, chapter 11, verse three.
"The integrity of the upright
shall guide them...
"but the perverseness
of transgressors...
shall destroy them."
will be judged
and dealt with accordingly.
There will be no excessive drinking...
What's that? That mean
we can swear in private?
Quiet! The colonel's talking!
Gentlemen...
we are honored guests here...
and we will act that way
according to the moral dictates of God...
science and hygiene.
- Hear. Hear.
-
- Dismissed!
-
What's the idea?
Hey, stop! Stop, stop.
Stop, stop!
Sanders, I know what you're thinking, but
believe me, even you can do better than that!
Achilles, you just stay outta this!
The colonel says this is a democracy.
Immortals!
Fire!
Men...
as of this moment...
we do hereby, under God...
become citizens of Nicaragua.
It is our mission to introduce into the family
of enlightened and civilized nations...
a new sister.
To help us in our just cause...
are two of Nicaragua's Liberal Party...
and defenders of democracy...
Generals...
-  Damn it.
- Castellon and Munoz.
Castellon and Munoz.
Three cheers for democracy!
- Hip, hip!
-  Hooray.
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray.
-
- Hear! Hear!
We march for Rivas.
As God is on our side...
victory will be ours.
- Hurrah!
-
Back!
-
-
It's a parrot, sir.
Don't do that!
Aw, shit!
-  What the hell?
-  You chaps do crash about a bit.
- Lost your way, have you?
- We're marching to Rivas.
Really? What on earth for?
We're liberatin' the country
for democracy.
How very peculiar.
You must be American.
Not no more.
We're Nicaraguans now.
- You draw that?
- Yes.
Why?
- What do you think, Captain?
- I think we oughta...
What do you think of these new guns?
I like 'em.
Six shots, and good-lookin' too.
- I wish we had 'em for that firing squad.
-  We wait until nightfall.
Then we attack from the south
and from behind the church.
- We will go straight in.
- That's right, Colonel. I'm with you all the way.
Just jump right in and grab 'em by the throat.
Don't give 'em a chance to get set now.
Excuse me, but haven't we just been assured
by Generals Castellon and Munoz...
that we're to be met
with no resistance?
Castellon is an indecisive old man.
Munoz is a conceited troublemaker.
At any rate, we will go in hard
with our eyes open.
First impression in a country
is very important.
Forgive me, but this is idiotic.
I prefer the last impression.
First and last are often the same.
History never smiles on pedants.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Lieutenant, may I have
a word with you, please?
l, who have studied
military strategy with Lubitsch...
Colonel, sir, could I have a word with you
one moment, uh, alone, sir?
- Certainly.
-
- What seems to be the problem?
- Well, there's no problem, sir.
I was just wonderin' though
perhaps maybe if, uh...
if I could be excused tomorrow
from being the drum major.
It's just that every time I've seen
pictures of battlefield scenes...
and, uh, I always see the drummer boy
lying dead next to his drum...
and, uh, if it's all the same to you, sir...
I'd like to trade my rifle in
for a drum.
I mean, I'd like to trade
my drum in for a rifle.
As long as you are under my command,
no harm will come to you.
Lieutenant.
Straighten up.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Some men abandon all reason
before going into battle.
They become so seized with fear that...
that often the battle is lost
before it's begun.
I know this will not
happen with you, Timothy.
Thank you for your confidence, sir.
Sir, uh, I feel I have to tell you...
The men are awfully confused about
just what exactly we're fightin' for here.
I mean... I mean, I know, and they know,
that the liberals are our friends...
and the conservatives
are our enemies, but...
well, to tell you the truth, sir,
I can't tell 'em apart.
They all seem the same to me.
That is no concern of yours, Timothy,
nor of the men either.
All you have to remember...
is that our cause is a righteous one.
I know that, sir.
I hope you do, Timothy.
I sincerely hope you do.
Get some sleep.
Yes, sir.
-
-
-
- Above!
Come on!
Colonel, what are you doing?
I'm doing the only thing
I know how to do... advance!
You dumb shit!
There's no reason for you
to talk to me that way, Timothy.
Sorry, sir.
It's just you're gonna get yourself
and everyone else killed.
Then we'll be together again,
won't we?
We must get into a house, Colonel!
- For God's sake, why?
- What?
Yes. Yes.
- Good idea, Major.
- Come, please! Come!
-  So, Dr. Jones, how is your day going?
- Just fine, William.
We have 11 dead, several wounded.
- How 'bout yourself?
-  Well, thank you.
Now that we have a plan, I feel sure
there will be a successful outcome.
Splendid, William.
- After you.
- No, no, no. I insist. After you.
- No, please.
- Well, let's go in together.
Very well.
- Is there a piano?
-
- Get your fat ass out of here!
- But I'm hungry!
God! I'm hungry!
- You heathen!
- * Darling, I'm growing old *
I'll shoot your eyes out!
- Goddamn music.
- * Silver threads **
Move it! Get him out!
Get him to a doctor!
We need somebody to dig through
the walls. It's our only way!
We don't have time.
We have to charge them bastards.
- Rout 'em out like we did before.
- Dear God!
- We have repeating rifles!
-
- They have muskets!
- We shouldn't stand a chance!
We're soldiers!
We kill people for a living!
- Yes, sir!
- Shit!
The colonel's leavin'!
- Move out!
-
Men, we must leave immediately!
What about the wounded?
The wounded will have to
take their chances.
- Go out the back when the charge goes off!
- You are not in command here!
We need another diversion. The men'll
charge through the hole after the blast.
Nay, the powder
will be enough of a diversion!
That is not my considered opinion, Major!
- You men! You, you, you, you, you!
-
- After the blast, charge through the hole!
- I'll go when you go!
Everyone else, out the back!
We'll meet outside the town!
Damn it! Fuck you, Colonel!
Benito's not goin' through no goddamn wall!
Huh?
- Major?
-
- Open the door!
- The fuse is burning!
Dr. Jones.
When you were a little boy...
did you ever have a moment
when you were sitting outside on the lawn...
and you picked up a blade of grass
or a beetle...
and you just looked at it?
And it was whole and perfect
and totally outside of time.
William!
You're late, Cole!
You were supposed to come by sea.
**
Magnificent tactics.
I commend you, General.
What do you mean, "tactics"?
Who is this man?
I'm Bruno von Namzer.
-
- Know what?
You have inflicted such heavy casualties
on the enemy that he has abandoned Rivas.
His troops are racked
with dysentery and cholera.
You broke their spirit, William.
You are victorious.
You have won.
We won!
-
-
We have won!
- We racked them with cholera and dysentery!
- Now is the hour of my destiny arrived.
-  We've won!
- I cannot lose.
Captain Hornsby?
Watch it! Come on, Hornsby.
Here... You must...
Goddamn it! My arm!
- Captain Hornsby, I must object...
-
-
-
Quiet, you ammo firers!
Listen up!
Colonel's about to speak!
Citizens of Nicaragua!
Today the city of Granada...
and the entire country of Nicaragua
have been liberated.
It is our sacred duty to join together
and unify this great nation.
- Tomorrow we must...
-
- Colonel!
-
Fire!
It is not my time to die!
It is not his time to die!
The assassin's bullet
has struck correspondence...
from that great Nicaraguan patriot
General Castellon!
It is he who has saved my life...
as it is I who shall save
the life of this country!
-
-
-
-
from the deepest of our hearts...
-
-
for the ending of our civil war...
and bringing us the precious gift...
- Hear. Hear.
- Hear. Hear.
- Hear. Hear.
- Hear. Hear.
What are we doing here?
What are your intentions...
toward the office of the presidency?
Turn it down
and offer it to Corral.
You'll own him,
and everyone will be happy.
Tell 'em you'll take
commander in chief of the armed forces.
I am deeply grateful
for the extraordinary privilege...
of being offered
such an exalted position.
However, I must regretfully decline.
It would be more beneficial
to the country...
if Walker were to protect
the democratic process...
as commander in chief
of the armed forces.
- Yeah!
- The army. Now we're talkin'.
I would therefore
like to nominate as president...
a great hero and patriot.
General Ponciano Corral.
- Walker! Walker!
-
-
-
for democratic advancement.
We must first establish agrarian reforms
before we proceed...
Release the natives from the army
so that they may resupply the labor force.
The Amer...
The American phalange will...
You must be patient with me,
Doña Yrena.
I'm a shy man in these matters.
-
- Look at that!
No water on Tuesday?
There was also no toilet paper,
no beer.
- This is Managua?
- No, this is Granada.
- Look at 'em floggin' those kids!
- Come on!
El Nicaraguense.
I know that guy.
He owes me seven bucks.
Next thing you know,
they'll be institutin' slavery.
It's the same racist, macho, sexist shit
we turned our backs on.
It doesn't have
the feel of victory in it.
It should be glorious and proud,
like the French revolution.
- Yeah, I think so too.
- But that's the way it was.
-
- Well, what do you think?
- Shall I send a copy to the commodore?
-
- And ask him for more money, if you would.
-
Top gringo
and heavyweight generalissimo!
We're his brothers.
- Really? I didn't know he had any brothers.
- Well, he does, okay?
William, we came down
as soon as we heard.
Everybody's talking about you in the States.
You're famous, man!
Yes, James.
Well, that's all relative, of course.
If you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.
Well, wait just a minute.
You know, we've been on the road for months
here comin' down here to help you out.
Yeah!
Yes. That's all I can say.
If you will excuse me.
Come on, come on, come on.
Maybe when you get some time, huh?
It's good to see you, James.
You too.
-
-
-
-
Ellen.
Oh, Ellie.
Oh, Ellie.
-
- Oh, Ellie.
Willians.
-
-
-
-
-
-
One must act with severity...
or perish.
What are you... Hey!
Put that... Put that down!
What are you, some kind of hick?
And don't give me that look!
and you're behaving like you're still
in some hamlet in the woods some...
There's power for you, huh?
Man doesn't even recognize his own brother.
What about Honduras and Costa Rica, Byron?
- Hey.
-
- Hey.
-
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
- Vanderbilt's plans are with Nicaragua...
Who the hell
do you think you are, Willie?
I'm your goddamn brother!
You throw me a bone, for Christ's sake!
Don't you ever talk to me that way
in public again.
You are welcome here
only if you contribute.
I have many brothers here,
and they're all equal in my eyes...
Don't give me that bullshit!
I don't believe in equality and neither do you!
You make me an officer
and give me some money...
or, by God, I'll stink up the place.
-
- Yeah! Yeah.
You and James will be lieutenants.
Nothing more until you earn it.
Get out of my way!
Boys, he made me a general.
You're a corporal.
I have an interesting letter here, sir.
"Lost is Nicaragua.
"Lost Honduras,
Salvador and Guatemala too...
unless we all unite
against the gringo."
I want you to arrest Corral.
Assure him he will
receive a fair trial.
William, want me to join 'em?
You'd better hurry, James.
William.
Yrena, por favor.
General Walker, Corral is
like a father to his people.
Then he is a tyrannical father
who would betray his children.
Treason must be punished.
I have no choice.
Doña Yrena says that it's...
it's a terrible mistake to kill Corral.
A mistake, General.
In this case, I entirely agree with her.
Morally, as well as politically.
You will lose everything
you have gained... up to now.
She said something else.
She called me a name.
What did she call me?
She called you a dog's asshole.
You know they are right, William.
If you persist in this,
everyone will hate you.
I cannot help that.
Sometimes a leader must listen
to a higher law.
What you say may be true, but it
is not, in the final view, important.
- Listen to reason.
- I ask you never to speak of this matter again!
- If you want my opinion...
-
General Corral shall not be
executed today at noon.
He shall be executed
this afternoon at 2:00.
-
-
Fire!
-
-
-
- A few rides after his funeral...
and I know we're in trouble
without a president.
- Gentlemen, if you want my view...
- I don't, actually. And neither does anyone else.
No need to get a wild hair
up your ass, Mr. Cole.
I was only making a suggestion.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Perhaps the time has come
for an election.
I won.
-
- Yes, sir.
-
-
What has this man done to my newspaper?
-
-
You're quite a hero
back in the United States, General.
Do you have any plans to go back?
Nicaragua is my country. As long as
I am needed here, I will never leave.
Your country is in a state of chaos.
Guerrilla wars are taking place.
And yet, you refuse
to engage the enemy. Why?
A protracted war against
scattered guerrilla groups...
would not only be disheartening
and dissatisfying...
but it would be too exhausting
for our American troops.
Have you anything to say
to the American people?
I certainly do.
Climb on board one of Commodore Vanderbilt's
steamships and come on down and see us.
His transit company,
which guarantees overland passage...
from the Atlantic to the Pacific...
is not paying you what they should.
He is, to put it bluntly,
exploiting you and the entire country.
Shame, shame.
Why are you telling me this?
Simply put, we propose to start a new company
and make you an even better offer.
But to do this, you must
revoke Vanderbilt's license...
and grant our company one instead...
on most favorable terms, of course.
You're telling me that Vanderbilt has
not been paying me what he owes me?
- That is inexcusable.
-
we wouldn't be here today.
That's true. Whatever good fortune
we have, we owe it to him.
Not only that, but he would be
a terrible man to cross.
I hardly think, gentlemen...
that Commodore Vanderbilt...
is responsible for my great...
our great victories in the field.
May I have a word with you, please,
William? I mean, Mr. President.
Certainly, Byron. Anything
you wish to say, you may say here.
Walker does not resort
to whispers and subterfuge.
Our great victories
notwithstanding, William...
we are utterly dependent
upon Cornelius Vanderbilt.
His ships are our lifeline
to the United States.
They provide us with money,
munitions, medicine and men.
We cannot risk
incurring his displeasure.
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!
Gentlemen...
it was granted to me
in our recent constitution...
that I have the authority and the autonomy
to do whatever I want.
Don't I?
- Don't I?
-
- Don't I?
-  Yes, sir.
Don't I?
Yes, you do.
I will not be betrayed by a man as vulgar
and insidious as Cornelius Vanderbilt.
I will, therefore,
revoke his permit.
I will also commandeer his vessels.
From this day on, they will be
the property of the Republic of Nicaragua.
You cannot be serious.
- Wanna bet?
- Surely, President Walker,
it might be more advantageous...
For you, perhaps, but not for me.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I have work to do.
Forgive me, sir, but I must contradict you.
Your work is here! Sir! Come back here!
-
- I've had it with you, foreign weasel!
Taking our jobs!
Poleaxing our women! Take that!
And that! And that!
You bastard!
I cannot help noticing, sir,
during the time I've spent with you...
that you've betrayed
every principle you've had...
all the men who supported you.
May I ask why?
No, you may not.
-
-
The ends justify the means.
- What are the ends?
-  I can't remember.
Nobody does that!
Do you understand?
Nobody fucks with Vanderbilt!
After all, we are all civilized men.
Civilized men?
From now on,
you're gonna be shoveling shit!
And if your mouths are not too full of it,
you'll thank me for the privilege!
- Thank you. Thank you, sir.
- That's how civilized I think you are!
- Thank you, sir.
-
-
-
You've not only betrayed
the commodore...
you've betrayed yourselves by putting
faith in that lunatic extremist Walker.
Now look.
You've upset the commodore.
this pathetic madman
was in charge down there?
- No, of course not. We didn't...
- Get out of here!
Both of you!
What should we do about Walker?
-
-
No one will remember Walker.
No one will remember men who lose.
Struttin' about as if he was a king.
One thing he didn't ken,
it's Vanderbilt that's runnin' the show.
If he ever opposed the bloke...
we'll be up to our necks in shit.
What have I got, Doctor?
It's cholera.
-  Hurrah!
-  What means this shouting?
I fear the people choose
Caesar as their king.
- Hurrah!
- While men...
Ah! That's mine.
Another general shout!
Hey, bring on the darky!
- Hurrah!
- Hurrah!
And we petty men
walk under his huge legs...
Where are you going?
-  You bastard!
- We are in crisis on all fronts.
We must have your attention.
Is there no way you could not have
waited till at least intermission?
- Shit!
- The men are going mad.
They're defacing the cathedral,
pillaging the precious artifacts.
Mr. President,
the men are on the point of mutiny.
- No, they are not.
-
-
- Vanderbilt has diverted his steamships
to Panama, cut off our supplies!
We have no new recruits, no money,
very little ammunition.
- Chinandega, Matagalpa...
- And every major Nicaraguan town.
- Pure unadulterated horseshit!
-
- Food!
- Booze!
- Money!
- Justice!
Food! Booze! Money! Justice!
Food! Booze! Money! Justice!
- You!
- What?
-
-  a disgrace?
Hey, private this, Willie!
Anderson.
- Holy shit!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Ah, shit!
- Give me his medals!
Give me his medals!
I want his medals!
Mother never liked you anyway.
Let me have men
about me that are fat.
Yon Cassius has
a lean and hungry look.
He thinks too much.
Such men are dangerous.
Men...
I have found a solution
to our problem.
Slavery.
What do you mean?
- We don't need no slaves!
-
-
- Fuck you, Walker.
- And medicine.
- Silence!
We will introduce
slavery into Nicaragua.
You can't do this to me.
I'm an American citizen!
-
- I have friends in high places!
"The Indian of Nicaragua...
"in his fidelity and docility
and in his capacity for labor...
"approaches nearly the Negroes
of the United States.
"In fact, the manners of the Indian
towards the ruling race...
"are now more submissive than those
of the American Negro to his master.
"The advantage of Negro
and Indian slavery in Nicaragua...
"will therefore be twofold.
"While it will furnish a certain labor
for the use of agriculture...
"it will also tend
to separate the races...
and destroy the half-castes
who cause the disorder."
"The Battle of Rivas, June 29, 185 5.
"Not more than a dozen went out
to drive away upward a hundred.
"And their charge swept
the enemy completely away.
"There was no thought of rank.
"But each one went forth
with his revolver...
"ready to do the part
of a true man in the fray.
"Never have I seen a collection of such
brave men assembled under one banner.
God bless them all."

I have studied with Lubitsch
and von Koch!
And you have the presumption
to talk to me of military tactics.
-
-
-
- Bruno... and the Germans...
they have a vision.
Always be a straight shooter, James.
I like the sound of that.
I must speak with you.
- I don't understand.
-
You speak...
I have spoken to you in many ways,
but you have not heard me.
But now you must, Willians.
Everything depends on it.
Did you see this?
I beg you. Please.
If we have a lot of death,
we will have a revolution.
We must not have that
if we are to survive.
We are both aristocrats.
I am not an aristocrat.
I'm a social democrat.
What's the matter with you?
I only want what is best for the
Nicaraguan people. I'm surprised at you.
Are you quite sure of that?
Absolutely! And shut the door
on your way out.
Okay.
Yrena, what are you doing? Bruno!
Instruct the men to burn the town.
-
-
What are you doing? Idiot!
- You are an idiot! Idiot! Idiot!
-
What is this?
-
-
You men, get the colonel's
brother's body outta here.
-
-
-
-
Mr. President.
- It's been a long time, Doctor.
- It doesn't seem like it.
-
- Yes.
Granada has been put to the torch.
- How many have we lost?
-
We must leave immediately.
- I will speak to my men one last time.
- Immediately!
- I insist, Major.
- Sir, I...  My arm!
Immortals, attention!
Unless a man believes that there is
something great for him to do...
he can do nothing great.
A great idea springs up
in a man's soul.
It agitates his entire being.
Transports him
from the ignorant present...
and makes him feel
the future in a moment.
Reduced to our present position
by the cowardice of some...
the incapacity of others
and the treachery of many...
we are yet writing
a page in history...
that it will be impossible
to forget or erase.
By the bones of our American dead
in Rivas and Granada...
I swear that we will never abandon
the cause of Nicaragua.
Let it occupy your every
waking and sleeping thought.
From the future,
if not the present...
we may expect a just judgment.

I have been instructed
by the State Department...
of the United States of America...
to return all American citizens
to their homeland.
Yes!
Sorry, only U.S. citizens.
That's it.
U.S. citizens! U.S. citizens.
Get your hands off me!
Goddamn it, get 'em off!
Shoot him! Shoot him!

Please, listen to me.
What is your nationality, sir?
I'm William Walker, president
of the Republic of Nicaragua!
I'm sorry, sir.
Move it out!
Colonel!
Let me say to those who invoke
the memory of Vietnam...
there is no thought...
of sending American combat
troops to Central America.
Maneuvers designated Operation Big Pine...
are being conducted less than 10 miles
from Honduras's border with Nicaragua.
Nicaraguans consider the exercise
a serious act of aggression.
The United States insists
the maneuvers are purely defensive.
This maneuver is designed to help
the Hondurans to defend their own country.
And it doesn't... it doesn't envision
any involvement of U.S. ground forces.
So far, 80,000 U.S. troops
have participated in the maneuvers.
Those leading the exercises
say it's all being done...
for the sake
of peace and self-defen...
The political side of the U.S. presence
here was not lost on some of the troops.
It's kind of a show
to, like, Nicaragua.
Yeah, I think we're sendin'
a message to them.
