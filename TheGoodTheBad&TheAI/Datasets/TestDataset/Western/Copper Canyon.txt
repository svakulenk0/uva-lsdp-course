Now, if the young lady
will open her eyes
and examine
the spots on the card.
They're gone!
But not your fingers,
I hope.
No...
Ladies and
gentlemen,
any of you can
shoot the spots
from playing cards,
given a steady hand,
keen eyes, iron nerves...
and 12 years
of practice.
My gratitude
for your assistance.
And to show
my appreciation,
I'd like to present you
with these
beautiful earrings.
I was told that
they once belonged
to the grand padishah
of Hindustan.
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Carter.
Thank you.
You're very welcome;
thank you.
Now, would another intrepid soul
step forward
to assist in a demonstration
which has astounded the crowned
heads of 11 countries?
Anyone will do.
No harm can possibly
come to you.
Aha, I see I have a candidate.
That's the spirit, young fellow.
Up the steps
right onto the stage.
Bring your feet with you.
Stand there.
Take this deck of cards.
While my back is turned,
choose one--
any card will do.
CARTER:
Do you have it?
YOUNG MAN:
Yes, sir.
CARTER:
Show it to
the audience.
What do you
think?
Sure enough
resembles him.
Exceptin' the time I seen him,
he had whiskers.
Well, the best thing is
to catch him outside.
CARTER:
Now put it back
in the deck.
Now watch closely.
In my left hand
I have the deck of cards,
in my right, the personal
throwing weapon
of the late
Colonel James Bowie.
With its help,
I shall endeavor
to discover the card
in question.
WOMAN:
Well, I'll be!
The ace of hearts.
:
Here he comes.
Colonel
Desmond?
Colonel
Desmond?
You gentlemen
speaking to me?
We were.
Afraid there must be
some mistake.
The name is
Johnny Carter.
Ah, no it
ain't.
I couldn't forget you,
Colonel.
Our outfit fought
right alongside of you
at Forest Ridge.
Just a minute,
Scamper.
Maybe introductions
are in order,
Mr., uh, Carter.
This is Mr. Newton,
Sergeant Joad,
and I'm Jeb Bassett.
All formerly of
the Ninth Virginia.
How do you do?
You were in the Confederate
Army, Mister... Carter?
Why, yes.
Yes, I was.
Good.
We want to make you
a proposition.
We need a man like you
where we live-- Coppertown--
to keep us from losing
our claims.
I know nothing
about mining.
The mines are all right.
There's something else.
We're being frozen out
because we're Southerners.
Coppertown's smelter
won't buy our ore.
We've had accidents
in the mine.
Three men killed already.
When one of us tries
to take ore to Mesa City,
something always happens
to him or his wagon.
What about
the law?
Get away
from me,
you overgrown
jackrabbit.
The law's against us, too,
won't raise a finger to help.
That's why we need a man like
you, Colonel-- er, Mr. Carter--
as a leader and...
Law breaker?
Let's say someone
who can face up to the law
if it isn't doing right.
What in tarnation do you want?
Chewing tobacco,
Sergeant.
SCAMPER:
Chewing tobacco?
Why-why, I never heard
of anything like...
What brand?
Here you are.
Well, gentlemen,
it's true I was
in the war,
but as a corporal.
But now I'm
a peaceful man,
following
a peaceful occupation.
I'm sorry, but I must refuse
your invitation.
Good night.
Colonel?
We were told to give you
a special message
from the man who brought us
out here--
Mr. Theodosius Roberts,
formerly of
Beardsville, Virginia.
Name's unfamiliar.
We got the wrong man,
Jeb.
I guess
you're right.
Nothing on earth could
keep Colonel Desmond
out of the fracas
we got.
Let's mosey.
Keep away from me,
will ya?
Hi, Travis.
Why aren't you fellows
working?
Ain't you heard?
Show people
coming to town.
Pretty gals!
MAN:
Figurin' on
greetin' them,
make them
feel at home.
I'll bet they'll
feel at home with you.
It's all right, Ma.
You done nothing
against the law.
Some people are kind of fussy
about ladies smoking.
Where you been
all day?
Riding.
You look it.
Where's Lisa?
In the saloon,
playing cutthroat
with the sheriff.
Again?
You'd think he'd
know better by now.
Hey...
Um, want to take
a peek?
Travis?
I want to ask you
something.
Go ahead, Cora.
How about treating
a girl?
On the 31st of February.
...31st of February.
She's in there.
Thanks.
MAN:
Howdy, Miss Cora.
WOMAN:
Five.
MAN:
I'm compelled
to raise you ten, Lisa.
LISA:
I'll call you.
Hello, beautiful.
Pick it up.
Three.
Fine way to treat me.
Next time
ask permission.
I will.
Next time.
How many?
Two to the dealer.
Check.
Have a nice ride?
Three went and
three came back.
MAN:
Oh, Sheriff?
SHERIFF:
Well, hello,
Mr. Balfour.
I hope I'm not
interrupting.
Not at all.
What can I
do for you?
Today is payday
at the smelter
and I'd like
your protection.
Now, Mr. Balfour,
there ain't gonna be
any trouble.
The Southerners have been
acting strange
the last few days.
Secretive and arrogant.
They're planning something,
maybe robbery.
Robbery?
You better go hold
his hand, Sheriff.
Who, me?
I'm no man for robberies,
I don't even carry a gun--
can't stand the noise!
You go, Travis, and take
Bat here with you.
You're my deputies,
ain't you?
All right.
But I'll tell
you this, Balfour,
the Rebs is
done for.
I disagree.
They're like wolves--
vicious, desperate.
They're just
a defeated people,
Mr. Balfour.
And rightfully so!
Slavers, secessionists,
lawbreakers and murderers!
They're like anyone else--
human beings.
I never could understand
why you won't deal with them.
Perhaps you would, ma'am,
if you lost a son at Gettysburg!
NEWTON:
Seems we had
the wrong man,
Mr. Roberts.
Some fly-by-night
vaudeville actor.
Name of
Johnny Carter.
That's strange...
He must look
mighty like
Colonel Desmond
because Scamper
was fooled.
Still am, 'ceptin'
it couldn't be,
not after the way
he acted.
We put it
straight to him;
mentioned your name,
like you said,
and told him
that....
Who could that be,
Caroline?
I'll go see,
Gramp.
Oh, it's you.
I'm afraid so, ma'am.
You see, I've got
orders to find out...
Same old orders,
Lieutenant,
or some nice,
fresh, new ones?
Well, it's just that
I have to make inquiries
as to whether you've
had any news of...
Oh, no, not again?
Sorry, ma'am.
My dear Lieutenant,
I may not look it,
but I'm quite grown up.
I can count up to ten
and I can even remember
as far back as a week ago.
I feel awful about this,
ma'am, but...
Oddly enough,
I can even remember
the questions
you asked me.
Now, since you've obviously
forgotten my answers,
I'm going to repeat them
to you again very slowly
and maybe it will save you
another visit.
Now, about my
brother-in-law,
Colonel Desmond.
One.
I haven't
heard from him.
In fact, I've never
heard from him.
Two.
I've never seen him
in my whole life
and I wouldn't know him
if I did see him,
because he was in
one of your prisons
when Tom and I
were married,
and he was still there
when Tom was killed.
Three.
And if I had him
right here in my pocket,
I certainly wouldn't
tell you!
Now...
do you think you can
remember all that?
Uh, yes, Mrs. Desmond.
Wonderful.
And isn't it enough
that he's
a defeated soldier
without your
persecuting him?
Oh, in this case, ma'am,
it isn't exactly persecution.
Well, what is it?
Well, you see, when Colonel
Desmond was a prisoner of war,
he escaped with the contents
of the Commandant's safe--
$20,000.
Good for him.
Well, now, why didn't you
tell me that before?
That's wonderful!
I'm afraid the United States
government feels different.
It'd like both him and
the money locked up again.
Oh...
Well, how long a term
would he receive?
They're saying ten years.
I know how you feel,
ma'am.
If you happen not to be
telling all you know,
I... wouldn't
blame you.
I think you better go.
What I'm trying
to say
is I'd much rather
be chasing Indians,
but since I have orders,
it's not...
ROBERTS:
Did you hear
what my granddaughter said,
Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
And in the future,
please remember you
are not welcome here.
Is that the young fellow
who was here before?
Yes.
But I don't think
he'll come back again.
Couldn't be
he's the reason
Colonel Desmond
wouldn't come,
wouldn't admit
who he was?
SCAMPER:
Might be.
No, Gramp,
it couldn't be.
If he were
Tom's brother,
he'd have come
regardless.
I reckon
you're right.
I reckon I don't have to say
that I'm disappointed.
Seems every hope we've
cherished for a year
has been a mirage.
Fool's gold.
BALFOUR:
Joseph Senn.
Yes, sir, Joseph Senn!
Ah, mister,
I do like payday.
I guess
that's right.
Yes, sir,
just is.
Rainbow Saloon,
here I come!
Save me a drink,
Joe!
William Barton.
That's me, and is this
a happy moment.
William Barton.
Nothing wrong
with that.
BASSETT:
Let me through here!
What do you want?
I want a word
with you.
I'm busy!
You weren't too busy
this morning
while you were smelting
my copper.
What do you mean?
Just what I'm saying.
While my boys was off hunting
and I was away,
some thieving scoundrel
carried my ore up here
and you smelted it
for him.
I want to know who.
I don't know anything
about your ore
or any other
Rebel's!
You're lying!
Either tell me who stole it
or pay for it--
I don't much care which.
Take it easy,
Bassett.
You keep out of this.
For once we're going to get
a square deal here!
Outside.
Get back,
all of you.
Keep moving!
I'm going, but
I ain't finished.
Watch that
door.
So you're telling me
to keep out of this,
huh, Bassett?
I certainly am.
Supposing
I don't?
We'll get someone
around here
who'll see
there's right.
Go ahead,
Ethan.
BAT:
Don't mark up
his face.
We want him pretty
for his folks.
Get him up and
out of there.
BALFOUR:
Travis!
You needn't have been
so brutal.
Why, Mr. Balfour,
you told me yourself
they're as dangerous
as wolves.
Whoopee!
Girls!
What is it?
Entertainers--
girls!
Ah, no, you don't!
Hooray!
Mr. Bixby.
That's me.
Ma Tarbet's
my name.
Welcome to
Coppertown.
I own this place.
Get your troupe in
and I'll show them where
they're going to roost.
Get back, boys,
get back.
The show goes on
tonight.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm the professor.
I play the piano.
I'm going to play
for you tonight.
Hey, hey!
I'll help him, sonny.
Watch it,
Professor.
Whoopee! I'm going to put
my brand on this one!
Whoa! No,
put me down!
That a boy, Lew!
Hold it, boys,
hold it!
Hold it!
Lew Partridge,
put that girl
down.
I said put that girl down.
PARTRIDGE:
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Lisa.
I... I never meant no harm.
That's better.
MAN:
Good for you, Lisa.
By golly,
he did come.
Who'd you say came?
Oh, nobody.
Nobody at all.
I... I was just talking
to myself, that's all.
He must've come here
to help us.
Oh, thunderation,
it's you again.
Or maybe it's
your cousin.
Oh, well,
here, here.
I thought we had troubles before
but it's nothing
to what's coming.
The boys
will probably be riding horses
up and down the halls all night.
Why don't you put
two in a room?
Two in a room?
I'm putting five
in a room.
Come on, gals,
I'll show you the way.
That leaves us two men.
Yes, you and
Signor Martelli.
Johnny Carter,
ma'am.
I thought you had
an Italian tenor.
Well, unfortunately,
he disappeared.
It's the strangest thing
I ever saw.
With us one minute
and gone the next.
Yes, luckily for you,
I had a few free days
between engagements.
You do sing Italian,
of course.
Only in the bath, ma'am.
What is this?
Mr. Carter
is a trick-shot artist.
Trick-shot
artist?!
Why, the town
is full of them.
TRAVIS:
Yes, it is.
And so is
the cemetery.
I hear you've got quite
an extensive one in Coppertown.
Well, I guess he'll
have to do.
You'll share
the same room.
Thank you,
Miss Roselle.
You know, ma'am, I never thought
the day would come
when I'd regret not being
an Italian tenor.
Well, I'm saying
we should pull up stakes.
And I'm saying
you're a quitter.
Ain't we got the
right on our side?
That we have.
Yes, and Moss Balfour
has got the might.
If we stick
together
like we done
through the war,
ain't nobody
gonna whip us.
As soon as my boys
get back,
I'm aiming to square
accounts with Travis
and that other
deputy.
WOMAN:
Jeb Bassett,
you lay back like
the doctor said.
MAN:
Sorry,
Mrs. Bassett.
We'll move along,
Jeb,
and let you get
a little rest.
Now, Martha, I'm fine.
We just heard
about it, Dad.
You hurt bad?
I'll be up and around
in a couple of hours.
Then we can decide what to do.
Jeb, you ain't gonna
pull them into this.
What's a man have sons
for if not to help him?
He's right, Ma.
I suffered enough
from the war,
losing Carey
and Tom,
worrying and praying
for you
and the other boys.
I'm wore out
with suffering.
Why can't we leave
like the others,
go someplace where it's safe?
A man's got to do
what he thinks best, Mother.
Come in.
Mr. Roberts.
Yes, come in.
Come right in, please.
I was told you wanted
to see me.
My name is...
Why, of course.
I know who you are.
Can't escape a reputation
like yours, you know.
Well, thank you,
sir.
It is kind of
a showy act,
but people seem
to like it.
Well, sit down,
Colonel, sit down.
No colonel.
Just plain
Johnny Carter.
Oh, well,
sit down anyway.
Thank you.
And, uh, Mr. Carter,
with a reward out
for Colonel Desmond's arrest
and every Yankee soldier
in the country out to collect,
I can readily understand
the colonel's reluctance
to admit
to his identity.
Haven't seen one of these
for years.
A useful gun in its day,
but like its owner,
no longer much good in a fight.
Tell me about Lisa Roselle.
Oh, you know it's very odd
that you should be so curious
about Lisa Roselle.
She's a beautiful woman.
Oh, come, come, sir.
I'll wager at my age
you'd be equally curious.
I say it's odd
because this Lisa Roselle
is within
the framework
of all the wickedness
that threatens us.
There's a scoundrel
named Henderson
who proposes to run us
out of the country
and take over
our mines.
Operating for him here
is this Lisa Roselle
and her crew
of bullyboys--
Deputy Sheriff Travis
and his men.
What do you know
about her?
Very little,
except that she's
a New Orleans
adventuress,
clever
and unscrupulous.
Quite a woman.
And quite an idea.
Yeah, that's part
of our trouble.
Travis and the others
we can handle, maybe,
but how does one
fight a woman?
Women are difficult,
sir,
but not invulnerable.
Somewhere along
the line
there's always
a weak spot
in their
fortifications
and to find it requires
vast experience.
But having found it,
they'll fold up
like army tents.
You certainly seem
to know your business.
And I might add that
their final capitulation
is always fraught
with the most charming
possibilities.
But one question,
sir.
Why am I being haunted
by the ghost of this...
this Colonel Desmond?
It's the simple arithmetic
of violence and oppression,
Mr. Carter.
My men are being killed
in the mines,
shot to death taking ore
to Mesa City--
the only smelter
that'll handle it.
They're panicked,
ready to quit.
They need a man who'll put heart
and guts into them,
a man strong enough
to blast Travis
and his men.
They need a leader.
Mr. Carter, won't you help us?
A vaudeville performer,
a trick-shot artist?
What chance
would I have
with a box
of toy pistols
against Travis
and his guns?
Besides, I'm
a man of peace.
I abominate
violence.
I'm sorry, sir.
I wish I could have helped you.
Good night.
I thought I heard voices.
You did.
Tom used to sing that.
He was singing it
the last time he rode away.
Was that Tom's brother?
Was it Colonel Desmond,
Grandpa?
Was it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well, did you warn him
about the Yankee lieutenant?
Why, no, I didn't.
Anything I can do,
ma'am?
Oh, I... I was looking
for Mr. Bixby.
Well, you'd hardly expect
to find him in there.
That, I suppose, is
meant to be amusing.
Oh, I'm a very
amusing fellow.
Oh.
Here,
let me show you.
Here you are.
Are you interested
in pistols?
Not in the least.
Well,
that's too bad.
We might've had
something in common.
You know,
personally, I think
there are
only three things
worth living for--
fine guns, good horses
and beautiful women.
At least that's one item
we have in common.
Would you be
kind enough
to let me
get out of here?
Well, the obvious
answer to that, ma'am,
is why did you come in?
I told you I came
to see Mr. Bixby.
Oh, yes, Mr. Bixby.
That's right.
Well, as an excuse,
ma'am,
that has a faint odorant
of fish.
You're impossible.
At least it entitles me
to a question.
Is this your
establishment?
Why do you ask?
Well, if it isn't, it's an awful
waste of something or other
for such an attractive woman
to be here.
Oh, well,
it is not my establishment.
Oh.
What are you doing here?
That is none of your business.
TRAVIS:
Well, now, maybe
it is, Lisa.
Maybe he's the fellow
we've been hearing about--
the Reb colonel.
I wouldn't try
any monkeyshines
with those cap pistols
of yours.
Wouldn't think
of it.
Besides,
I should tell you
that you've
been misinformed
about my military rank.
It's Corporal
Johnny Carter.
Corporal or colonel,
I got a piece of advice.
I wouldn't mix in things
that don't concern you.
Why not?
We don't like
troublemakers.
We got a nice
little community here,
chock-full of law and order,
and we aim
to keep it that way.
We?
Mr. Travis
is from the sheriff's office.
Oh, well, now, I'm all in favor
of law and order.
TRAVIS:
I'm glad to hear that,
because if you wasn't,
I might start remembering
I never did like
Rebs anyhow.
Now we can talk
more sociable.
That was quite a shot,
Mr. Carter.
Yes, it was...
quite a shot.
It's my business--
eyes closed, mirrors,
upside down.
You take one
of these things,
liable to kill people--
that's no good.
Here, take it.
I never liked them
because when you
kill a man,
he dies just as bad
or just as stupid
as the moment you put
the bullet in him.
But if you let
him live,
he's still got a chance
to learn things.
Well, that's smart,
provided he learns
the right things.
Take what I just learned.
You're as full of tricks
as a tame crow,
but tricks don't mean much
in a showdown.
Face to face,
it's speed--
how quick you can throw out
pieces of lead like this.
Yeah,
that's a point.
Ma'am.
Yes.
I hope you'll honor
my performance
with your presence this evening.
I think I will.
How about you?
I'll be there.
MAN:
You reminded me
of the old lady.
All right,
all right.
Well, Mrs. Desmond, are
you here for the show?
No, I'm not.
If it's a church
benefit,
I've got tickets coming
out of my ears.
Oh, no, it isn't.
I came to see one
of the entertainers.
By the name of Carter,
I'll bet.
Why,
how did you know?
Oh, I had a husband once
looked something like him.
Drawed gals the way
molasses does flies.
He's in there
by the stage
getting ready
for his act.
Could I speak
to him?
Sure,
go right ahead.
Thank you.
Mr. Carter.
Yes, ma'am.
Could I speak to you
for a moment?
Why, certainly.
I'm Mrs. Desmond...
Mrs. Thomas Desmond.
How do you do?
Well, perhaps the name
doesn't mean anything to you,
but if it does,
I... I just want to warn you.
There's trouble here--
a Union officer
looking for Colonel Desmond.
A Union officer?
Yes, sir.
Could that be the one
standing there?
Your bet.
Oh, dear,
I'd better go.
Oh, not on my account,
please.
No, really,
I'd better leave.
Hey, ain't you going
the wrong way,
sweetheart?
I'm going out.
Hey, come on, have
a drink with me.
Please, let me go!
Oh, come on.
Oh, come on,
princess,
we got business
at the bar.
Let me go!
Why be so stubborn?
Please!
A couple of
drinks won't...
I'd count it a privilege,
Mrs. Desmond,
if you'd let me
escort you home.
Why, I appreciate
your kindness, Lieutenant...
If it's not wanting
to be seen with me,
well, I can walk
ten paces behind.
I don't suppose even
your grandfather
would object to that.
No, I... I don't
suppose he would.
WOMEN:
Take back the heart
that thou gavest
What is my anguish to thee
Take back the freedom
thou cravest
Leaving the fetters to me.
ALL:
Drink deep
of life's fond illusion
Gaze on the storm cloud
and flee
Swiftly through strife
and confusion
Leaving the burden to me.
Thank you, Marie.
TRAVIS:
Lisa.
Come in.
Well.
Do you like my dress?
This time I'm asking
permission.
And again you're
being refused.
Couldn't be you're dressing up
for that Carter?
I always like to look
as well as possible.
What do you make
of him, Lisa?
I don't know.
Why?
Kind of like
to find out
if he's up
to anything or not.
Why not wait
and see?
Well, I'll tell you,
not waiting
is the main reason
I'm around today.
Found that out
during the war,
when it was shoot
or get shot.
Found out a lot
of things.
Take what the fellow said
about not killing people
so they can learn.
He's wrong.
Is he?
The important thing
is to stay alive
so you can learn.
That sounds
reasonable.
It is.
And I'll tell you an even
more reasonable thing
I found out.
What?
You never have
to dodge bullets
from a dead man.
You're being
too serious
for a man who's come
to take me downstairs.
What's that?
Let's see.
Six less pipes
in the world.
And now, to assist me in my
final and most prodigious feat,
I need the services
of a volunteer.
Volunteer.
Professor?
Volunteer.
Professor,
would you oblige?
Yeah.
Volun... Who, me?
BIXBY:
I guarantee you won't get hurt.
I hope his eyes
are in good shape.
I... I won't
get killed, will I?
Not this time.
Just stand there.
Take this ball
in your right hand
and hold it up.
Who're you waving at?
I... I'm nervous.
Just hold it there.
Now, with this small
caliber pistol...
and with the aid
of this mirror,
I shall endeavor
to smash the globe.
Professor?
Yeah?
I shall count three,
and on the word "three,"
I shall fire.
You... you'll count to three?
Yes.
Are you ready?
Oh... uh, yes.
One, two...
Quite a shot.
Kinda evens the score,
doesn't it, Carter?
It does indeed.
My compliments.
And my compliments
to you, ma'am.
Thank you.
Thank you,
Professor.
By the way,
would you like
to become a permanent
member of the troupe?
I, uh...
I see your point.
Ladies
and gentlemen,
it seems that
my performance
this evening
has been
concluded for me.
Miss Roselle, may I have
the honor of joining you?
If you like.
Thank you.
Suppose one of
those toy guns of yours
could sting
a man a little.
Oh, kill him
in the right place.
Think so?
I do.
Ma'am, you look as if
you'd just stepped
from a Mardi Gras
cotillion.
You've been
in New Orleans?
My favorite city.
I was there once.
Never liked it myself.
Well, perhaps
you didn't go
to the right places.
Do you remember those
wonderful restaurants,
charming people,
the Comus Ball?
How does a
vaudeville performer
happen to attend
a Comus Ball?
Oh, vaudeville
performers enjoy
such things, ma'am.
They enjoy good food,
pleasant surroundings,
dancing and...
beautiful ladies.
If that's
the case,
what are you
doing here?
Talking to
a beautiful lady.
Well, that I grant.
But if you can perform
in such fancy places,
why Coppertown?
As I told Miss Roselle,
I was persuaded to come.
A while ago,
I was talking to Bixby.
He was wondering how you
happened to be so handy
when his Italian singer
walked out.
Says it wasn't five minutes
later that you showed up.
BAT:
Travis?
Yeah?
They're comin',
just down the street.
Maybe we can talk
some more later.
Your friend
doesn't seem to like me.
No, he doesn't.
That's odd.
But then,
you're odd, too.
You wondered how I
happened to attend
a Comus Ball.
I might ask you
the same thing.
I never have.
Travis...
Keep away from me.
Is there going to be
any trouble?
You heard what I said--
keep away from me.
We'd better
stay out of this.
Come on.
Now's the time to make
your play, Colonel,
with that fancy
shootin' of yours...
while they
ain't expectin' it.
My gun's
right by your hand.
No, I don't hold
with violence, Sergeant.
I reckon I got
the wrong man.
Where's Travis?
Right over here, Bassett.
I come
to give you warnin', Travis.
Do you hear me?
I've come to give you warnin'.
Go ahead.
If you ain't
out of town by sunup,
I aim to hunt you down
and shoot you with this...
Professor, play some music,
and play it loud and fast.
Calm down.
Lisa.
You saw what happened--
strictly self-defense.
I saw three men
shot in the back.
She's right.
Like as not
the governor'll
send someone down here
to investigate.
Then where'll
you and Lisa be
with your copper mines?
ROBERTS:
I wish I could
change your mind.
But what have I
to stay for now?
They're all gone,
all of them except
the youngest here.
I'm takin' him
back home,
where he'll
have a chance
to learn how people
can live together
without killin'
each other.
But Mrs. Bassett,
I've got a plan
for getting the ore
through to Mesa City.
Now, if you and the others
will only wait a few days.
We've waited too long
already, Mr. Roberts.
Good-bye.
Good-bye,
Mrs. Bassett.
Good-bye, Rufe.
Good-bye.
LIEUTENANT:
Sergeant, take charge.
All right, son.
I'm, uh...
I'm deeply obliged
to you, Lieutenant,
for giving them escort.
Well, I'm glad to be
of some assistance, sir.
Good day, ma'am.
Good day,
Lieutenant,
and thank you.
Unless my plan works,
the others are going
to be leaving, too.
Scamper, I want you
to get to town.
Take a message to Mr. Carter.
I'll get it there
just as fast
as I can, sir.
ROBERTS:
You see, it's less than 30 miles
to Mesa City.
Not much of a haul, provided
nobody tries to stop the ore.
I was going to have the men
start at daybreak.
By nightfall they'd be there.
Then as soon as it was dark,
they were to double back
and cut off
onto the Old Red Creek Trail.
Yes, but look, Red Creek Trail
runs mostly in a canyon.
There's a dozen places
for an ambush.
A scout could bring the men
over from the main road
in plenty of time
to catch the wagons.
What would you do?
I'd go the regular way.
Look at the terrain--
there's only one place
for an attack, right here.
ROBERTS:
But an attack is what
we're trying to avoid.
Sure, but if one comes,
you'll be fighting it
on ground of your
own choosing.
Still,
leaving at daybreak
would get them there
after dark
and that's no time
to be ambushed.
Well, let everyone think
you're leaving at daybreak,
then leave at midnight.
Might even get through
without a fight.
If we follow your plan,
Mr. Carter,
will you consent
to come along?
Well, I... I'll
be wishing you success.
Now, if you'll
excuse me,
I've got to get
back to the Rainbow.
You're leaving us now?
Yes, I have
some work to do.
He's got some work to do.
Good-bye
and good luck.
It was a mistake
asking him here.
NEWTON:
His plan doesn't sound so bad,
but after all...
By golly,
I got it.
What?
Know how
Colonel Desmond won
the Battle
of Maple Ridge?
No.
Let it be known
he'd attack at daybreak
and then hit 'em
at midnight.
The same thing.
Just about time.
Well, hello, Travis.
Hello.
It couldn't be the 31st
of February, could it?
Do you think
it ever will be?
What do you think?
I'll tell
you what I think:
She's no good for you.
You two don't
belong together.
You're different...
like whiskey
and champagne.
I'll be seeing you.
Cora... any day
of the month
is all right
with me.
Still set
for midnight?
Yeah.
They're still figurin'
on him goin' along.
All right, get going.
Do you want your dress
now, Miss Lisa?
Yes, please.
TRAVIS:
Lisa?
I thought I told you
not to come up here.
Just wanted to talk to you
about your elegant friend.
Seems he's got
the Rebs convinced
he's Colonel Desmond.
What do you mean?
He's taking charge
of their ore train.
Changed their plans
so they're leaving
at midnight,
and told them
he'd ride with them.
Where'd you find
that out?
Oh, I got
friends around.
Thought
you'd be interested
in how he pulled
the wool over your eyes.
But don't worry...
I'm meeting them
with a dozen men
instead of three.
This is supposed to be
a business, not a war.
Mr. Henderson's orders were
only to watch and to report.
And make sure the Rebs
don't get prosperous.
Yes, but in a legal way.
Nothing was said
about using violence.
Now, Lisa...
All we're going to do
is scare 'em a little...
them and your friend.
What about him?
The Rebs might make
a fight of it
if he's along.
Wouldn't do...
not when they're
on their last legs.
Best thing
is to convince
him not to go.
It's going
to be interesting
to see how he acts
when the chips are down.
Heard tell he was
a regular fire-eater.
What are you
going to do?
Depends on
what he does.
How come
you're so worried?
Couldn't be you're
soft on him,
could it?
No, I'm not soft on him.
Well, that's good, because
I wouldn't like to think
of your grieving over him...
case he gets hurt.
Evening, Sheriff.
Seems like you
enjoyed the show.
Oh, that I did.
And I enjoyed your
act, too, Mr. Carter.
You know everybody's
talking about
how wonderful you are.
Thank you, Sheriff.
You know,
I heard something
about you today, too,
but, of course,
I didn't believe it.
Huh?
What did you hear?
Well, I heard that you had
absolutely no say
in appointing
those deputies of yours,
that Travis and the others
just walked into your office
and pinned the stars
on themselves.
Wasn't
that way at all.
I got well paid
for takin' em on.
Well, I guess
certain people
got a lot
of money to spend.
Yes, they have.
Guess they got a right
to spend it any way they...
Say... why are you
so interested?
Oh, just
idle conversation.
Yeah?
Hello, Lisa.
Want to play?
No cheating?
All right.
Ma'am, you're as lustrous
as Cinderella tonight,
but unlike her, you
at the stroke of 12:00.
I hope I don't
disappoint you.
On the contrary.
You're mighty glib with those
pretty speeches of yours.
Where'd you get 'em?
Oh, make 'em up.
That's interesting,
because I've kinda taken
a dislike to 'em.
Many people have.
And to you, too.
That's not impossible.
Don't provoke easy, do you?
No.
Maybe this'll do it.
Can I borrow your
handkerchief, Sheriff?
Thank you.
Now, if you people
will excuse me,
I have several things
to take care of.
Good night.
I gave him his chance.
What are you
going to do
with somebody
like that?
I think I know.
You think
this'll hold him?
Yes... with a little help
from me.
I don't like
this idea of yours,
but I guess it'll do.
The ore train
starts at midnight.
We'll have to leave
by 3:00 at the latest
if we're gonna
head 'em off.
How'll I know
if he's here?
I'll signal
from the window.
At 3:00.
At 3:00.
Don't forget--
this is business,
not pleasure.
I won't forget.
Ten past 12:00.
We'd better be startin'.
But Carter
ain't here yet.
Likely he's plannin'
to join us along the way.
Give 'em the word, Zack.
Let's get in the wagons.
Hey, Bill, do me
a favor, will you?
What is it?
Take this critter
to Mesa City
and find somebody
to have him
for five dollars.
Who'll pay five dollars
for that?
Who said "pay"?
The five's
for takin' him!
That's a lot of money.
Not alongside of
the baccy I'd save!
All right,
I'll take him.
MAN:
Head on!
More of that
champagne stuff.
They must be washing in it!
Nothing wrong
with that.
Come in.
Well,
look who's back,
my friend,
the champagne man!
Put it right down here.
And accept this
with my compliments.
Thank you.
You want
any more, Lisa?
This will be enough,
thank you.
There is never enough!
As the poet Horace said,
"From Sabine jars
bring forth
the sparkling wine."
But we have
no Sabine jars.
No matter,
no matter at all.
Ma'am,
it's very interesting,
the things you told me
about New Orleans.
I guess
it must have been
pretty bad there
after the war.
It was.
I bet you could've married
a rich carpetbagger.
Maybe, or maybe
I could have become
a seamstress.
But I preferred
coming west.
I really wanted to go
to San Francisco.
Oh, why?
I was told about
a building there
that could have been
made into a theater
for plays, or even opera,
but that required $20,000.
Well, I'd hardly
think Coppertown
would be the place
to get that
kind of money.
You know, I've been telling
you my life history,
and you haven't said
a thing about yourself.
Oh, it's a very
dull subject, ma'am.
The history of
a trick-shot artist?
It's filled
with such things
as gunpowder, bullets,
trajectory, recoil.
I'm sure we can think
of something livelier.
For instance?
Well, I could tell you,
and in great sincerity,
that you're one of
the two most beautiful
women I've ever met.
Who is the other?
Ah-ah, that's not
a sporting question.
Why not?
Well, one of these times
I'm going to meet
another beautiful woman
and I'm going
to say to her,
"I think that you're one
of the three most
beautiful women
I've ever met."
And she'll say to me,
"Who were the other two?"
And how would you like it
if I said,
"Oh, Miss What's-Her-Name
and an angel out of heaven
named Lisa Roselle."
There's nothing wrong
in saying that.
Ah, well, it isn't
what I say,
it's the way I say it.
Am I still being dull?
Mmm... amateurish,
I'd say.
Mmm.
Still amateurish?
Well...
Three o'clock.
Oh, yes... 3:00.
Where are you going?
My... my maid is
in the other room.
Well, send her away.
Yes.
I'll have another
little pick-me-up.
I think it would be nice...
:
Johnny!
Johnny, come back!
They'll kill you!
MAN:
Should we open up
on them now?
TRAVIS:
No, I want them
further along.
Cuttin' them in half
is the only way
we can beat them.
Too many of them otherwise.
MAN:
Whoa!
Looks like we run into
an ambush ourselves.
No use tryin' for
that ore train now.
Let's get that fellow
on the ridge.
Wonder what happened.
Somebody got behind them
and drew them off.
I think we better
get movin'.
His horse is tiring.
We'll follow him
down the canyon.
So he was smart enough
to stake out another horse.
But I got a good idea who he is.
Let's get back to town.
Why, hello,
Mrs. Desmond,
Lieutenant Ord.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Nice day for shopping,
isn't it?
Yes, isn't it?
Why, he didn't go.
That's very strange.
I heard the rumors, too.
Heard he was leading
the ore train as
Colonel Desmond.
Well, he doesn't act
like Colonel Desmond.
Hello.
This is an unexpected
pleasure, ma'am.
Hardly expected you
to be up before noon.
Where have you been?
Oh, out strolling.
It's nice out.
I mean last night,
after you left me.
Why, in bed, ma'am.
Where else?
I told you champagne
makes me sleepy.
You're lying.
I was in here.
I was in here
a dozen times!
Oh.
Too bad I missed you.
Should have told you,
though--
I walk in my sleep.
You met up with that
ore train, didn't you?
Didn't you?
Ah-ah, temper, temper.
You don't want
to get lines under
those beautiful eyes.
You fool!
Save that grin
for the undertaker!
Oh, Johnny!
Johnny, it's no good
for you here,
no good at all.
The hours I've been waiting,
knowing where you've gone!
They're too much
for you, too many.
You saw what
they did to Bassett--
shot him in the back.
And they'll do
the same to you.
If it isn't Travis,
it'll be some Yankee soldier.
They'll shoot you
for a thousand-dollar reward.
See, Johnny,
I know who you are.
You... you must go now!
Oh...
I must go.
So that's it?
It took you long enough
to make the point,
but you finally got there.
And believe me, it was
quite an oration.
For a while there,
you had me on your side.
Johnny, it isn't what
you're thinking at all.
It's just that I...
You don't trust me!
You think it's
a trick to get you
away, don't you?
Johnny, you've
got to leave!
Or otherwise?
Guess we finally
caught up, Carter.
Stand away
from him, Lisa.
What'd you do
with your rifle?
Rifle?
Don't happen
to have one.
You did
this morning.
You'd better break
down and admit it.
I'd be glad to, if I had
anything to admit.
How about it, Lisa?
When did
he come in?
When did
he come in?!
He hasn't left
the hotel all night.
BAT:
Travis.
What do you want?
Mr. Henderson wants
to talk to you
Mr. Henderson?
Yes, he just
got here
and he'll be wanting
to talk to you, too.
Don't you worry,
Mr. Carter...
I'm going to get
around to you yet.
Thanks for what
you did for me.
But it doesn't
make sense...
any sense at all.
We leased this hotel and saloon,
put you in charge,
and engaged Mr. Travis
and his men to assist you,
all at considerable
expense.
We did this
to secure the mines.
I know, Mr. Henderson.
Now we learn
a consignment of ore
has slipped through
to Mesa City,
and that there's dissension
between you
and Mr. Travis.
There is dissension, because
I object to the use of violence!
Well, one could hardly refer
to the actions
of the constituted authorities
as violence.
I can and I do,
and so will the governor if
I'm forced to appeal to him.
Appeal to the governor!
Come, come, Miss Roselle,
isn't that rather
a dangerous thing to do?
Surely you must realize
that for whatever has happened
here-- for whatever violence--
you are equally responsible
with us.
And another thing--
by the terms
of our agreement,
it was specifically...
I remember perfectly.
It was specifically agreed
that whatever was to be done
was to be done peacefully,
without violence...
without bloodshed!
You haven't kept your promise,
Mr. Henderson.
Wait a moment.
Doesn't it seem
a pity, with your job
so nearly finished,
that you should
sacrifice the money
we guaranteed you?
After all, you know,
you still have
your obligations.
It seems I haven't
made myself clear.
I'll put it this way.
You have failed to live up
to your promises.
From now on, I feel
perfectly justified
if I fail to live up
to mine.
Don't give her a thought.
You know how women are.
There isn't much more
Lisa could do anyways.
Time has come for me
to take over.
Leave it to me
and by tomorrow,
we'll have these Rebs
on the run.
Look, here's how
it's going to be--
tonight's big doin's--
a dance.
The whole town
will be there.
Well, it's going
to be this easy.
DANCE CALLER:
Left to your partner,
reverse allemande
Right to your corner,
right and left grand
Whirl them right
and whirl them wrong
Straighten them out
and trot them along
First and third form a star
Right hand across,
"How do you do?"
Left hand back,
and "How are you?"
Swing to your home,
take up the slack
Ladies to the center
back to back
Gents go around
the outside track
Swing that lady
round and round
Right and left through
when you come down
Hold your hands
and all be gay
Take your lady
in a half sashay
Elbow hook one time round
Number one arch,
they're comin' to town
Hold his hand
and duck down low
And dive for the oyster,
don't be slow
I'll swing yours,
you swing mine
Swing her home,
you're doin' fine...
He sure has gall,
a-comin' here.
And with her!
Maybe we shouldn't be
havin' the dance anyway--
least not till we hear
from the ore train.
Why, it's the regiment's
ninth anniversary, Scamper,
and the best way of showin' them
we're not licked.
DANCE CALLER:
Swing that lady
with a double elbow
Right and left
and don't be slow
Promenade one and all...
What's that Yankee horse thief
a-doin' here?
Scamper, Caroline
and I invited him.
Thought it was
about time
we became part of
the United States again.
Maybe you got something there,
Mr. Roberts.
DANCE CALLER:
Center couples
stop and swing
Outside couples,
same old thing
Dosey now around your pet
Balance there,
you're not through yet
Swing with a double elbow
Right and left
and don't be slow
Glide right, glide along
Stop that glide,
you're goin' wrong
Glide to the left
and don't be slow
Honor your partner
before you go.
Thank you, ma'am.
That was
most delightful.
Thank you.
May I get you
some refreshments?
Thank you again.
Will you excuse me?
Yes.
Mr. Carter.
Yeah?
Newton and some
of the fellows
from the ore train
just rode in and
they want to see you
before anybody else.
It's important.
Where are they?
Outside.
They're right out here.
They don't want
anybody to see them
on account of they...
Take him back
to the corral.
Quick!
Mr. Roberts!
We made it!
The ore's sold,
and the wagons are
on the way back.
That's wonderful!
We got $1,600
for it.
Took it to your house
for safekeeping--
figured you'd
divide it tomorrow.
It'll be the greatest
pleasure of my life.
We'll tell the folks right now.
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen--
an announcement!
Our ore has reached
the smelter at Mesa City
and has been sold for $1,600!
Any sign of him?
Of who?
Mr. Roberts, naturally.
Oh, no, not yet.
He'll be along
pretty soon, though.
Sure rejoice to get all
this money off my hands.
Yeah, it's a lot of money.
We're going to get more,
lots more, the same way.
About time our jinx
was broken.
Another week and I wouldn't
have been eatin'...
Where's the money?
Thanks.
What's the matter,
Travis?
You been in a fight,
tryin' to protect the money.
Why I haven't got
a hole in my skull,
I'll never know.
How long were
you unconscious?
Must have been
at least an hour.
Oh, that's why Miss Roselle
couldn't find you.
She's been up here
several times.
She has?
Oh!
Now, there's a gal that's
as smooth as a wet eel,
but a lot easier to look at.
Looks like we got
here just in time.
Didn't think
we'd move so
quick, did you?
What are you
talkin' about?
See if you
can find
the money.
Just a second!
Take it easy,
Carter.
Guess I'll
have to.
Hello, Lisa.
What's going on?
Suppose you tell me!
Johnny Carter's
in real trouble.
He took money from
the Southerners-- $1,600.
I don't believe it!
SHERIFF:
It's true.
We got a witness!
I got a good look
at him
just before
he knocked me out.
Here's the money, Travis.
Found it in his gun case.
Well, that kind of
clinches it, Lisa.
Looks like Miss Roselle's
at a loss for words,
although up to now,
I must admit
she's given
a wonderful performance.
Well, Johnny, I guess you
better pack your things
and come off to jail.
You'll like it,
it's real peaceful.
It's easy enough.
I can ride to the fort,
secure a federal warrant
and have you out of here
before dark,
if you'll just admit
you're Colonel Desmond.
I don't see
the percentage in
that, Lieutenant.
Well, it's better
than being killed.
In here?
You wouldn't be
the first prisoner
that's been shot
trying to escape.
CAROLINE:
Can't you just say
you're Tom's brother,
even if you're not?
No, afraid I can't.
Besides, I'd kind of like
to see that $1,600
get back to its original owners.
It's odd a man
would worry about that
and not worry
about the $20,000
that was taken
from a federal safe.
Well, it might be that
the man who took the 20,000
was just getting back
what was taken from him
when he was captured.
That could be.
As far as our money
goes, Mr. Carter,
you can't touch it.
Travis has
impounded it--
says it might be a year
before it's released,
and even tomorrow
would be too late.
Everybody's packing,
getting ready
to leave this afternoon,
even Grandfather.
Does Balfour know
you're leaving?
CAROLINE:
I don't know.
Will you do something for me?
Have him come down here
and see me.
I can try.
I believe I can
persuade him, Mr. Carter.
Will you do it
right away?
Yes, sir.
I'd like to escort
you home, ma'am,
but you understand,
I'd best ride up
to the smelter.
If you could help
in any way,
I... I'd be
eternally grateful.
That's what
I'm counting on, ma'am.
I'm not quitting,
now or later.
The stake's too big
and I'm in too deep.
And so are you, Lisa.
Whether you like it
or not,
we're in this
thing together.
And I've got an idea
you're going to like it,
once Carter's
taken care of.
You're not doing
anything more to him.
No?
Remember what
I told you once
about never having
to dodge bullets
from a dead man?
Well, that still goes.
We'll see.
It's no use
going to Henderson.
As of last night,
I'm in charge here,
and if I have to prove it,
I will.
Who's that?
It's me.
What do you want?
The Desmond girl
and her lieutenant's
been talkin' to Carter.
Yeah?
Now the lieutenant's
on the way to Balfour.
Have Bart round up the boys,
then you and I'll ride up
to the smelter...
just in case.
Don't get in my way,
Lisa.
It says it plain
in the Book, Mr. Carter.
It says, "I will take
all the families
of the North
"and bring them
against this land
and the inhabitants
thereof."
It said that about two
Now, these people
are no different
than the people of the North.
They worship
the same God,
read the same Bible.
They killed my son.
But they lost sons, too,
and husbands and brothers.
Oh, I know you feel unhappy
about the Bassetts being killed,
but I'm sure that in some way
you must feel responsible.
How could not buying their ore
make me responsible?
But if you'd buy,
there'd be no more trouble.
I swore I'd never
deal with them.
Suppose I quote
a little, too...
from a man on your side--
Mr. Lincoln:
"Let us strive to bind up
the nation's wounds,
"to do all
which may achieve
"a just and lasting peace
among ourselves,
with malice towards none,
with charity for all."
What are you doing here?
Visiting.
Get out...
both of you!
Who's going to protect
you from the Rebs
if we get out?
I won't need
any protection.
From now on, I'm going
to buy from them
just the same
as anybody else!
Don't think so, Balfour,
on account we've
closed the smelter.
On what grounds?
We'll think of some.
I'm beginning to see
how blind I've been.
I'll appeal to
the governor, Mr. Travis,
and in the meantime,
I'll offer the Southerners
financial aid!
Johnny.
Johnny!
What are you doing here?
Open the door.
You've got to leave.
But I hadn't thought
of leaving.
You've got to!
You've got to get
out of town!
Get out of town?
Let's not go
into that again.
It's gettin' monotonous.
Listen to me.
This is your last chance!
Your interest in me,
ma'am, is positively
touching.
How stubborn can you be?
Tonight they are planning
to kill you!
You know, you sound
mighty convincing, ma'am,
but I guess
I'll stay here.
They have too many
people being killed
escapin' from jails.
SCAMPER :
Mr. Carter, Mr. Carter!
What's the matter?
Trouble!
Balfour's dead--
shot in the back
by Travis.
And now they're
buying up our claims
at ten dollars apiece.
Where are they doin' that?
At the Rainbow--
Travis and some
fellow from Denver.
Meet me around in front.
Yes, sir.
I guess I'll have
to reconsider that
escape, ma'am.
LISA:
Johnny!
There's a horse outside,
with money and provisions
in the saddle bag.
Head for California.
I'm sorry I can't
oblige, ma'am,
but I've got some business
with some friends of yours.
Scamper!
Yes, sir.
The night the Bassetts
were killed,
you offered me your gun.
I'll take it now.
That's what I've been
waitin' to hear!
Oh, no, Johnny,
don't!
What can I say?
What can I do to make
you believe me?
Look at me!
Can't you trust me?
Frankly, no.
HENDERSON:
Sign here.
Next.
Right on this line.
Next.
Just a second!
Sorry to spoil your fun,
my friend.
What do you mean?
Stay where you are,
Sheriff.
I mean the sale
has been called off.
Well, you're
a little late, Carter.
Yes, I already have more
than two-thirds of the claims.
Not anymore!
I don't know who you are,
but I'm quite sure you'll regret
this... this illegality!
There's nothing
illegal about
changing your mind.
Well, that's debatable,
and I doubt
if these people
have changed their minds.
They know it will be months,
perhaps years,
before they can sell their ore.
Oh, why?
The smelter's been closed,
pending investigation
of Mr. Balfour's death.
TRAVIS:
Well, look who broke out
of the jailhouse.
Carryin' a gun, too.
Hear you've been using
yours today, Travis.
Must be a specialty
of yours...
shootin' people
in the back.
So I'm going to give you
a chance at mine.
Joe, give me a beer.
JOE:
Coming up.
What are you going to do now,
Carter?
No more tricks, huh?
That's good, because I'm going
to call your play.
Kick that gun over here.
Come on,
kick it over!
Now get against the wall.
You see Travis?
He just passed me
at a gallop.
He's probably
gone to the smelter.
Yeah, that's where
his gang is.
Well, looks like a job
for Roberts' Raiders.
There's a
pack of men
out there.
MAN:
Be like attacking a fort.
ROBERTS:
Mr. Carter?
If my men go,
will you take command?
Gladly, sir.
How many men will ride?
Somewhere around 40, I think.
That's enough
for two troops.
Newton!
Yes, sir.
You take command of
the first troop, and...
Sir, I request permission
to lead the second.
CARTER:
In that uniform,
Lieutenant?
I just gave myself
Permission granted.
Gentlemen, I suggest
we all meet
at Mr. Roberts' house.
You'll be wantin'
a bugler!
That we will.
Lisa, would you allow me
to apologize?
Of course, Johnny.
I'd like to express
my gratitude.
When I come back,
if I can find the words,
there are a lot of things
I want to say to you.
Will you be here?
Come back safely.
Don't worry.
Prepare to mount!
Mount!
Forward!
Ho!
All right, take your men
and fan out in front.
Let's go!
More than likely
they'll turn tail
at the first shot.
Yeah?
Well, supposing
they don't?
We've got a surprise
for them.
Bat, show him
our surprise.
Blasting powder.
All right, fan out!
Sergeant!
SCAMPER:
Yes, sir!
Looks like we got them
on the run, Lieutenant.
Sound recall!
CARTER:
Both columns in force!
Forward ho!
MAN:
Ya-hoo!
MAN 2:
Whoo-whoo-whoo!
We'll never
make it.
I'm afraid
he's right, sir.
I tell you
what you do:
dismount half
your men,
maintain a continuous fire
from this area,
and in five minutes' time
with the rest of your men,
charge again,
you understand?
BOTH:
Yes, sir.
Right.
Come on, giddy up!
I think our five minutes
are up.
Like suicide
to charge now.
They're bound to have
more powder.
Our orders were
to charge
and I propose
to follow them.
We're with you,
Lieutenant.
I think they're
going to charge again.
Get more
blasting powder.
You might as well
give up!
You're surrounded!
Drop your guns!
NEWTON:
Go on, get
out of here!
NEWTON:
Get over in there!
Where's Travis?
In there.
Shall we take the prisoners
back to town, sir?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Lieutenant, you did
a fine job for us.
Thanks.
From the commandant
at the fort, sir.
The sergeant thought
it might be urgent.
Tell Mr. Carter
I'd like a word with him.
Mr. Carter just
rode away, sir.
Giddy up!
Hup! Hup!
Whoa! Hold it!
Where do you think
you're going?
Sacramento.
Los Angeles.
Well, make up
your minds.
Well, uh, it really was
San Francisco.
Look, here's $200.
Get me an engagement ring--
the best
it'll buy.
It'll be a pleasure,
Lieutenant.
Why, congratulations.
Thank you,
Miss Lisa.
And here's a nail I bent
to the exact size.
And now, Mr. Carter,
it'll ease my conscience
if you'll get the blazes
out of here.
My congratulations, too,
Lieutenant.
It's "Captain,"
now, Scamper.
Just got the news.
Well!
Here we go.
Any special plans?
Well, I'd still like
to open that theater
if I could raise
the money.
$20,000, wasn't it?
Mm-hmm.
You know, by a strange
coincidence,
I happen to have
just that amount
in the lining
of my gun case.
A gift from an uncle
in the North.
Well...
maybe I should marry
the uncle.
Oh, no.
Oh, no!
