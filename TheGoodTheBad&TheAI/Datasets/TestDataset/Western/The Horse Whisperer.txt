-
That shit !
- Hello !
- Hello !
- So, did you ask 'em ?
- Yep. They said fine.
- Oh, good !
- Sure it's okay with your mom, right ?
Yeah. She doesn't care.
She's working.
- Isn't she coming up this weekend ?
- I don't know.
So, uh, come on.
How cute is he ? Spit it out.
- Oh, he's kind of gorgeous.
-Yeah ?
He's sort of like
a cousin, but not really.
- He wants to be a forest ranger.
- Oh, good.
After dinner we could set a fire in your
room, and he can come and rescue us.
You should have seen
the look on her face.
- I never laughed so hard, I swear.
-
- Hi, Gulliver. How you doing, boy ?
-
-
- Hey, Pilgrim.
- Come here.
-
Hey, babe.
Such a beautiful boy.
What are you thinkin', huh ?
What are you thinkin', boy ?
You wanna go for a ride ?
Let's go for a ride. Come on.
Come on, boy. Come on.
- Hello.
- It's me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
So what train
are you taking ?
- Um, I should be in by 2:00.
- Okay.
You want me
to pick you up ?
No, I can take a cab.
Grace go riding ?
Mm-hmm. What do you want
to do about dinner ?
- I hadn't thought.
-
- I can ask to try that place--
- Oh, hang on.
- They're here, so--
-
I'll let you go. We'll figure it out
when you get here, okay ?
-
- Yeah. Okay. Okay, then. Bye. Hello.
- Oh, God, please !
-
Where are the paintings ? It's about
her work, and we can't even see it.
- But we're trying to--
- We can change the color of the deck.
- And we can move it up
so then you could see the pain--
- We need to see the paintings.
- She's an artist. Have you
checked on her going rate ?
- Gottschalk.
Yes, the legal department's
on that right now.
- David !
-  Did you speak to Felton ?
Yes. We're suing.
Well, is that absolutely necessary ?
It'll just make it a bigger story.
- Am I on the speaker ?
- David, he signed an agreement...
that he wouldn't talk to the press,
and now he's libeled me
by saying I faked the figures.
You're not going soft on me,
are you ?
- Well, nothing like a good public feud.
- Exactly.
-
- You know that kid Adam ?
- Yeah ?
- Mm-mmm. Very cute !
- I think you'd make a good couple.
- I don't think so.
- You think he's cute? Are you serious?
- I think he's cute.
Who's that kid
that lives next door to you ?
I think, I think, l--
I think you have
a crush on him.
All right. Let's take a shortcut.
Let's take a shortcut.
- You know, we can't even read it.
- Friday is confirmed.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We have to reshoot this.
-  I said it
-  I said that
-  I said it
-  I said that
- It's "that" ! I swear to God.
- It, it, it, it !
- That, that !
- Fine. Let's start again. Ready ?
- All right. Fine, fine.
- All right.
I met him at a party
And he told me
how to drive
-  He said he'd like to do it faster
-
I said it--
- Come on.
-  Judith.
I said it
It !
Come on.
- Gulliver. Gulliver, up ! Up, Gulliver.
-
- Judith !
- Hey ! No !
- No, no, no !
- Grace, look out !
-
-
Pilgrim !
- Judith ! Judith !
- Grace !
-
- Hello !
-
-
No.
Gulliver !
Gulliver ! Stop !
Hold it, Gulliver !
Gulliver !
Come on !
Robert.
Judith's dead.
And what about Grace ?
- She's in pretty bad shape.
-  It's a multiple trauma.
- Where is she ?
- She's still in the O.R.
O.R. ? What for ?
It's, it's, it's a mid-shaft tib-fib
fracture with a vascular compromise,
meaning the blood supply
to the lower leg--
I think they have to take
part of the leg off.
Which leg ?
The right leg.
- Oh, Jesus.
-
Okay.
-
- Just take it easy.
This is gonna be tough
on both of us.
So let's not make it
any harder than it has to be.
Judith.
- That bag's almost empty.
- Oh, they'll be in to change it.
Leave it up to these people.
Excuse me.
- My daughter needs a new l.V.
- Yes, I know. We have her down.
Well, I'd like it
taken care of now, please.
You have to stand up
to these people constantly.
I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
We really should let her get some rest,
and I do have to change the bandage.
You can come back in a couple of hours
and see how she's doing.
Mrs. MacLean ?
Mrs. MacLean, you have a call on
line two. You can take it right there.
- Hello.
- Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace ?
Her leg was very damaged,
and they had to remove it.
Oh, God. Annie, I'm so sorry.
Listen, l, I know that
you're being hit with a lot now.
It's hard to think about anything else,
but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
Hello ?
Yeah, I'm here.
I've never seen an animal with
these injuries still breathing.
I'd like your permission
to put him down.
- It's, it's really the best thing--
- Uh, l-- Y-- Uh--
- You mean shoot him ?
- Annie.
Well, um--
Um, look, Liz.
The doctor's here right now,
and l, I can't...
make this decision on my own.
Annie, I understand that,
but I have to know--
- Just do what you can, okay ?
- No matter what I do, this
horse will never be the same.
Well, look, l, l, l, I just don't know.
It's Grace's horse--
- It's not right to make it suffer.
- I cannot deal with this now.
I-lf you need a yes or a no,
then don't do it.
Okay ? Just, just, just, j-just
do what you can for him, okay ?
Okay ? Just, just, just, j-just
do what you can for him, okay ?
Right.
Animal should be put down.
Anybody can see that.
What did he say ?
Nothing.
He's just going off duty.
Well, that's important
information, huh ?
Christ.
Doctors, huh.
I'm gonna get to know
all the nurses' names.
It's, it's good
to know their names.
- I'll go get some of her things.
- I'll go.
No, I'll go.
You stay,
in case she wakes up.
-
-
You guys go on ahead.
I'll be up by Christmas.
I meant to tell you.
I got those tickets for the Knicks game.
- Good.
- Wanna come, Annie ?
No. Why don't you go
with a friend, Grace ?
Yeah.
Wanna eat something else, honey ?
We can order out something else.
No, I'm just not that hungry.
That's all.
Well, you should try to eat anyway.
It's the only way you're gonna--
I said I wasn't hungry.
- Wanna watch some television ?
- She should finish first.
Maybe.
I just-- I-- I can't.
- Here.
- I'm sorry.
No, Dad !
I got it. Got it.
Sorry.
- You've gotta stop doing that.
- What ?
Helping her all the time,
running to her every time she trips,
anticipating her.
You know, Annie, this didn't
just happen to you.
Hi, Grace.
I don't care what he told you.
The man's a liar.
He's an actor,
for God's sake.
- He'd do anything to get a cover.
-
Gracie, what happened ?
It doesn't matter.
I just--
I don't wanna come back.
That's all.
Well, what are you gonna do ? I mean,
you have to go to school, sweetheart.
I said no ! I don't want to come back.
That's it. I wanna go home.
Grace, listen to me, hmm ?
Your leg is just healing, and you have
to give the rest of you time as well.
Is that your version
of a pep talk ?
Well, you're not staying home all day,
feeling sorry for yourself.
You're gonna get up,
and you're gonna figure this out.
Fine.
It's still early.
What's your next class ?
Gym.
It don't mean a thing
without an attitude
No, no, no
-  Attitu--
-
An excellent
jump. Head and hands, eyes, perfect.
Pilgrim moves with absolute confidence
at the command of Miss MacLean.
- What is it, sweetheart ?
- I wanna see Pilgrim.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Hi.
It's so good to see you.
How are you doing ?
- She's doing just great. Aren't you ?
- I'm fine.
Watch your step.
Mind how you go.
It's muddy back there.
-
- Back there ?
What do you mean ? Why isn't he
in the barn with the other horses ?
-
- Well, Grace, you see,
Pilgrim just isn't the same
horse that he used to be.
As a matter of fact, maybe now's not
the best time for you to see him.
I really wanna see him.
- Can you open it, please ?
-
Hey !
Hello, beautiful boy.
-
-
No !
-  No. Oh, God. No, no. Wait.
-  Grace.
- No, Grace.
- No, no, no, no ! Leave me alone !
Here. Grace.
- Grace !
- Mr. MacLean, I'm so sorry.
- Dad, why didn't you tell me ?
- I'm so sorry.
You should have told her, Annie.
This animal is beyond help.
Annie, can I have your permission now
to put him down ?
No.
And get me every publication
on riding, racing, breeding.
Everything.
Medical publications as well.
Veterinarian journals.
And tell 'em it's me, and I want it now.
- Hold on, hold on. Gottschalk.
- I'll call him back.
- He's on his way to the airport--
- Lucy, I'll call him back.
I'll call him back.
Just get me what I want.
"A million years before man,
"they grazed the vast
and empty plains,
"living by voices
only they could hear.
"They first came to know man
as the hunted knows the hunter,
"for long before he used horses
for his labors,
"he killed them for meat.
"The alliance with man
would forever be fragile,
"for the fear he'd struck
into their hearts...
"was too deep to be dislodged.
"Since that Neolithic moment,
"when a horse
was first haltered,
"there were those among men
who understood this.
"They could see
into the creature's soul...
"and soothe the wounds
they found there.
"The secrets uttered softly
into troubled ears.
These men were known
as the Whisperers."
It's perfectly shot,
perfectly cropped,
perfectly laid out,
and I am so bloody bored.
Start again.
Thank you. Would you excuse me
for one minute ?
Yes.
- Hello ?
- Yeah. This is Tom Booker.
- I got a message you called.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Booker.
It's Annie MacLean from Cover.
You know, the magazine.
Um, well, thank you
for returning my call--
- Is there something I can do for you ?
- Yes, yes.
I read this article about what you do
for people with horse problems.
Well, the truth is, I help
horses with people problems.
Well, whichever way
you want to put it.
Um, this article said that you were,
you were a, a horse whisperer.
Oh, they said that, huh ?
A whisperer. Hmm.
And I was hoping that
you'd come to New York...
and take a look at my daughter's
horse and possibly do some--
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I'm,
I'm afraid you've misunderstood...
whatever it is you read
because that's not exactly what I do.
-I mostly conduct clinics--
-Could you come to New York for the day?
It's only a few hours by plane--
And I'm not doin' them now.
I'm on my way to Montana.
- I have a ranch to take care of.
- I'd pay your fare. Uh, first class.
Ma'am, first class to Montana
is a waste of good money.
Well, if you could just give me
a time when you'd be available.
See, am l, am I being too polite
when I say "no" here in Nevada ?
Does that mean "yes"
where you are ?
I'm really sorry for your situation,
but there's nothin' I can do.
You just called the wrong person.
I'm sure there's some
fine horse doctors back east.
No, but I don't want a horse doctor.
I want you.
So I hope everything goes okay
with you and your horse.
- Well, but, you see, it's not my horse.
- So, so, good-bye now.
-
-
Grace ?
Grace, it's Mom.
Grace ?
Grace ?
Are you all right ?
- I've decided about Pilgrim.
- Oh.
I think we should
put him down.
It's not fair
to let him suffer.
- Well, I think that's a very--
- Maybe they should put me down too.
- Well, I think that's a very--
- Maybe they should put me down too.
- What ?
- I'm not much use anymore.
-
- You're getting a fax.
You're up late.
Is it ?
- How was the dinner ?
- Is Grace asleep ?
- Yeah, I think so.
- Nothing we haven't heard before.
Just louder this time.
That's all.
- So why'd you go ?
- One of us had to.
They're still
our friends, Annie.
Listen, I had a thought.
What do you think we go
someplace warm, the three of us ?
Bermuda or the Bahamas or--
What ?
Mmm, nothing.
No, I just don't know if Bermuda
would be such a good idea.
Grace would have to wear
summer dresses or shorts.
Oh, of course, of course.
What is it ?
I want to take Pilgrim out to see this
horse guy-- drive him out to Montana.
-
- No, I'm serious.
Wait. I thought you said you didn't
like the way he sounded on the phone.
Well, I didn't.
- I want to take Grace with me.
- You're kidding.
Liz'll find me a trailer.
We can stay at motels along the way.
- You made arrangements already ?
- No, I just checked out a few things.
Wait a minute.
Drive a crazed horse--
Oh, he's not crazed, Robert.
Don't exaggerate.
- I just can't pack up and leave.
- I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
By yourself ? How ?
You can't take care of Pilgrim.
He'll be sedated.
I do know a thing or two about horses.
- What about the magazine ?
- I'm in charge.
- I can oversee things from Montana.
- Oh, you're in charge.
What about Grace ?
The doctor says she needs stability.
I can't say he's being
all that effective with her.
Are you a psychiatrist ?
He says it takes time.
I don't care what he says !
I cannot sit here and pretend
everything's gonna be all right.
- I am not pretending. I am trusting--
- We have to do something !
We are losing--
We are losing her !
I don't care what the doctors say.
They don't know her.
I don't care if this
doesn't sound rational.
Nobody is suggesting anything better !
I, I can't explain it, Robert.
I just have this feeling.
I just know
it's the right thing.
Why, Annie ?
I just know it.
Does this, uh, cowboy vet
know that you're coming ?
Yeah.
- What if Grace doesn't wanna go ?
- She will if you think she should.
And you think it's best
if I don't come.
- No, that's not what I said.
- Daddy ?
I don't wanna go.
Straight back. Come on.
- A little closer. A little more.
-
Watch it.
Get behind him.
-
-  Hold it. Get back !
-  Watch it !
-  There he goes, Eddie !
-Why don't you get inside and--
- We're doing the best we can!
It's the only way to load
this kind of horse.
Keep trying !
- We should give him another sedative.
- We did.
-
- Get the gate ! Get the gate !
Get out of here !
Hold that door !
-
-
You got a gun, just in case ?
Of course not.
That's probably best.
You may want to shoot yourself
halfway to Ohio.
-
-
Grace, are you hungry ?
Do you want to stop for lunch ?
I don't care.
I want to find a place before
it gets dark. What do you think ?
- Grace.
- Doesn't matter.
Okay, listen up.
This is what I'll do:
I'll get to the next motel,
see if they have a fax--
-
- Oh, wait. Hang on. Uh--
I gotta go, okay ?
Later.
Grace, do you wanna put
your music on up here ?
Grace.
Do you want to put
your music on up here ?
And when you
purchase your Eureka World Deluxe Vac--
Near the agricultural
markets, and farm news headlines--
lnsecticide for small grains.
Important to always read
and follow label instructions--
This here man was
rejuvenated in the grace of the Lord.
- He was washed.
-
Mmm, Grace, look at this.
Do you wanna see that ?
- I don't care.
-  I don't care.
Oh, it'll be fun.
You haven't see any
of the sights yet. It's history.
When I was 13, I used to love
doing things like this.
Well, you were never 13, Mom.
Oh.
Great idea, Mom. Now what ?
How long is this gonna go on ?
- What ?
- You know what I mean.
Do you want us to go back home ?
ls that what you want ?
What are you asking me for ?
You didn't ask me if I wanted
to come in the first place.
Now I get to decide ?
Sorry.
Do you know
who I'm doing this for ?
- I'm doing this for you.
- Bullshit !
It's all about you-- about you deciding,
about you being right !
-It's like we work for you or something!
-I don't believe this !
- How come Daddy didn't come, huh ?
- What do you mean ?
You know everything.
You figure it out.
- Your father had to work.
- Yeah, right.
Please stop acting like you know
what you're talking about.
You are amazing, you know ?
I mean, you act like I don't
even live in that house anymore.
You think I don't know what's going on ?
You think I'm still five years old.
- When you act like this, you are.
- How long are we gonna be away, huh ?
- I don't know. I don't know.
- What if this guy can't do anything ?
I don't know !
I don't have all the answers.
No, you just act like you do.
- You okay, ma'am ?
- Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.
That young lady's
gettin' a little worried.
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night.
- You buckled up ?
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you cold ?
- A little.
You may have
seen the Kennel Club champion...
being rewarded with a box
of chocolates the other day.
Veterinarians and humane--
But I can't
get you out of my mind
Winter weather got you down ?
Wilson Travel is offering charter
packages to sunny Orlando, Florida.
Well, looks like
lots of precipitation, overnight.
Rainfall an inch and a half. Plus,
it looks like another half an inch--
He had an epiphany.
Paul had been transformed
by the grace of God,
so he was a new creation
in Christ.
He said the man
was completely--
Up from down
in the Northern Plains, John Deere.
We're glad to see you.
Gee, this place looks like fun.
Don't they believe in signs
around here ?
What would they say ? "Ten miles to Big
Rock, twenty miles to Bigger Rock" ?
- No.
- Great trip. I'm having so much fun.
I think I should turn here.
Oh, yeah. Those rocks
over there. Much more interesting.
Can we take a look at Bronty's
foal when we're done here, Dad ?
Sure. As long
as she don't mind.
There's this kid at school says
we should have imprint-trained him.
Says if you do it as soon as they're
born, makes 'em easy to handle later on.
That's what some folks say.
There's this thing on the TV
about a guy who does it with geese.
He has this airplane. These baby geese
all grow up thinking it's their mom.
He flies it, and they just follow him.
You hear about that, Uncle "T" ?
Yeah. Heard about it.
-What do you think about all that stuff?
-Well, I'll tell ya, Joey.
It might be all right for geese
to grow up thinkin' they're airplanes,
but horses,
as far as I can tell, can't fly.
We expecting company ?
- You know who it is ?
- Nope.
- Mr. Booker ?
-  Yeah ?
Tom Booker ?
Annie MacLean from New York.
We talked on the phone.
I had a little bit of a hard time
finding the place. There are no signs.
Oh, there are plenty of signs,
just not many of them pretty.
Why do I get the impression
that you're just not driving through ?
I want you to take a look
at my horse.
It won't take long, and if you still
feel the same way, I'm sure I can find--
You thinkin' about personally
driving me back east ?
Oh, no, no.
No, I brought him along and my daughter
too. We're, we're at the Lazy "J" Motel.
You hauled him
all the way out here ?
Well, yeah. I had a trailer.
It's not like I made him
run alongside the car.
- By yourself ?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, I appreciate the pains
that you've obvious--
Look, please don't do
the "Shucks, ma'am" thing again.
I have just driven a few thousand miles
for a few minutes of your time.
I have brought him
all the way out here.
Just take a look at him.
If you still feel the same way,
I will be on the road by morning, and
you'll never hear from me again, okay ?
Deal ?
We're at the Lazy "J" Motel.
Whenever you're free.
You don't have to call.
Jesus !
-
-
-
-
- Mom, the door.
-  No.
-
- No services, and one doctor in town.
I managed to find
a therapist for Grace.
I had to drive, like, two hours.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Did they get
the color corrections ?
- Yeah.
- I'm Tom Booker. Is your mother around?
She's on the phone.
She'll be right out.
- Could l--
- Mom, there's a cowboy here.
This is not Gottschalk's business.
Why is he interfering with this ?
I told him I'd
take care of it.
No, I told him I'd take care of
it, and I will take care of it.
I just have to get myself
settled here.
Well, um, put it
in a memo, and I'll sign it.
This your first time
in Montana ?
Oh, no ! Really ?
Uh, it's absolutely ridiculous.
It's completely ridiculous.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. I can imagine.
I can imagine. They are ?
Then why did you go to meet him,
alone, secretly ?
That's, that's funny.
No, really ?
- I can't believe that.
- Is she gonna be long ?
Probably. She's on the phone
- What does she do ?
- She's an editor.
An editor. Ah, ah, yeah.
Just in case she hasn't told you,
which she probably hasn't,
I don't wanna be a part
of this, okay ?
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.
-
Hi. Sorry about that.
Grace, this is Mr. Booker.
Did you look at Pilgrim yet ?
- I was gonna take that look now.
- Would you like me to come with you ?
I have to run over to the office
and give Mr. Peterson a check.
- Doesn't matter.
- Grace,
do you wanna come with us--
take a look at Pilgrim ?
Probably best
she stay behind anyway.
Okay.
- Howdy, Lester.
- Howdy.
- Goin' to see that horse ?
- Yeah, thought I might.
You know, I hope you got insurance.
That dirty son of a bitch.
Ha ! Hyah !
Shh, shh.
Well, you're the closest
anyone's ever gotten.
I have to be honest with you.
I still feel you've made
a long trip for nothin'.
But before
I even think about it,
I need to know somethin'
right now.
And it's a question
for Grace.
You see, when I work with a horse,
it's no good just me doin' it.
- The owner's gotta be involved too.
- That'll be complicated.
You can make it as complicated
or as easy as you like,
but she's the one
that's gonna be ridin' him.
Am I right ?
Hey ? Right ?
Now here's the deal:
I don't know
that I can do anything,
but I'm prepared to give it
a go, if you'll help.
-
- Oh, you have a problem with that ?
Isn't it, like, obvious ?
Not to me.
Either you want to or you don't.
- Look, I'll talk to her--
- Excuse me. With all due respect,
this is her decision,
not yours.
Now I don't wanna waste anybody's
time here-- mostly mine.
Well, nothin' else
to do around here.
That's not good enough.
I can't help you.
What do I have to do ?
I said,
what do I have to do ?
Well, what does she want ?
Does she want you
to take care of her horse ?
- Somethin' like that.
- And they're stayin' in the motel ?
- The Lazy J. Can I have some butter ?
- Not exactly a tourist stop.
Well, well, what about the girl ?
Doesn't she go to school ?
I don't know.
You know, I just think she's got
a lot of nerve showin' up here,
draggin' that, you know,
poor animal and that child all the way--
Honey, don't eat
with your fingers.
Frank, don't you think
she's got a lot of nerve ?
Well, hell, I don't know. According
to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman.
She must have thought
it was worth it.
Yeah. Well, I guess they'll want
feedin', bein' out here all day long.
I don't think
they'll expect that.
What, they gonna drive 40 miles into
town every time they want a hamburger ?
- Mixed salad.
- What ?
Well, I believe women
from New York eat mixed salads.
- Ain't that right, Tom ?
- I believe so.
Well, that's just what we need--
a vegetarian from New York
on our cattle ranch.
A Great Traveler,
interested, not merely a good one,
is a kind of introspective.
As she covers
the ground outwardly,
so she advances towards fresh
interpretations of herself, inwardly.
And this is the quality
which lends Starks' books...
the memorable poetic density
which is their special cachet.
Moreover, it is this quality
which makes them as fresh and--
You at a good place to quit ?
I got him moving out a bit,
but that's about it.
Still a long ways away
from gettin' a leg over him.
Well, we're movin' along.
What's he doing ?
Is this some kind
of physical therapy ?
Hello ? Hello ? What ?
- No, you're breaking up.
-
Hold on, hold on.
Don't start a fight with him.
Joey, give me the rope.
Just to pull him back.
We'll never get him outta there.
Let me go in after him.
Mr. Booker, I'm really not comfortable
with you taking these kind of risks.
- Oh, God !
- Hey, hey ! Pilgrim !
Let him go !
Let him go.
Does that hurt you ?
Only when I kick somebody.
Don't you go to school ?
I'm taking a break.
Don't you ?
School turns out
early for us...
so we can work the ranch.
Look at him out in the pasture.
He must have been a big,
beautiful-lookin' horse.
How was he to ride ?
Excuse me. I've got
chores to look after.
Are we in the way ?
Should we leave ?
I guess we'll go, then.
From now on, leave your
phone somewhere else.
Miss MacLean, would you and your
daughter like to stay for dinner ?
Joe, take off your hat at the table.
I don't want to say it again.
Uh, dear Lord, we are humbly
thankful for these gifts,
for the blessings on our home,
our family and our guests.
And bless those
that aren't as fortunate.
Bless all God's creatures.
Amen.
Amen.
- Like some roast beef ?
- Looks great. Thanks.
Thank you.
- Want some milk ?
- Yeah. Thanks.
Old Hank got us a couple more men
to move the cattle.
And what kind of cattle
do you raise, Mr. Booker ?
Well, we run a mixed herd,
but mostly Black Baldies.
Wh-What are those ?
Black Angus Herefords,
instead of straight Herefords.
- Oh, Black Angus. Of course.
-  There you go.
And, uh, wh-what's
the difference ?
-They suit the weather better.
-Their udders are black instead of pink.
They don't get burnt with
the sun bouncin' off the snow.
They make good mothers.
Our daddy raised
straight Herefords.
You know, that's interesting.
I-- I've always wondered--
every time I eat when
I go into a restaurant--
what's the difference between a
regular steak and a Black Angus steak ?
I can never taste
the difference,
but I could swear that one
was more tender than the other.
I didn't know there was
that much difference between the cows.
Of course, I've never
been on a cow farm before.
It seems to me that the bulls
have the best of the time,
just laying around the fields,
waiting for somebody come along
and ask them to do their work.
You get born a bull, got a 90% chance
of gettin' castrated,
served up as hamburger
or somethin'.
On balance, I reckon
I'd choose being a cow.
Yeah.
Hey, young man.
You get back up to bed !
So, how's the Lazy "J"
holding up for you ?
Oh, it's fine.
I still can't get used to how dark
it gets around here, though.
Every time I leave the ranch, I hold
my breath until I can see the motel.
Well, by golly,
that's a lot of drive time.
You know, Tom, while you're
working on that horse of theirs,
Annie and Grace should move
into the old creek house.
Nobody's usin' it. It's silly for her
to be driving back and forth...
when she, she don't know
her way around that well.
Well, that's very kind of you,
but really we're fine where we are.
Oh, hell, look,
I know the Lazy "J."
Whole place is as good
as falling down around your ears.
Frank, they're already
all settled in.
And anyway, I'm sure
they want their privacy.
It's got doors, Diane.
It's private as can be.
Tom ?
I don't have a problem with it.
I think it's up to Annie.
Well, it'd be great
for when my dad comes to visit.
Where is your dad, honey ?
He's at home, working.
Yeah. I don't know, um--
Is it worth it, really ?
I mean, how long do you think you'll
carry on working with Pilgrim ?
That depends on Pilgrim.
I know. Me too.
When are you coming
to visit ?
Yeah, well, there'll be plenty of room
'cause we're moving down to the ranch.
Yeah, yeah. They've got this really
cute little house down by the creek.
It's really pretty.
Okay. Okay.
I love you too.
Hold on.
Dad wants to talk to you.
Hi.
She sounds like
she's doing all right. How is she ?
Yeah. You know, I think she seems to be
getting more comfortable on the ranch,
which is, which is the only reason
I said yes to this move.
Well, it makes sense.
So, how are you doing out there
in the Marlboro country ?
Is the magazine
complaining at all ?
Yeah, but nothing
I can't handle.
Lucy says she thinks Gottschalk's
plotting. But what else is new, huh ?
So, when are you
coming home ?
You know, I asked him that myself
tonight, and he doesn't know.
Hmm. I miss you, Annie.
Yeah, I know.
We miss you too.
Good night.
'Night.
Did you ask him
to come visit ?
You already did.
Do you want me to help you pack ?
- Hi.
- Howdy.
What's he doing ?
He's trying to get him
to hook on.
How's it going ?
-
-
Get, get ! Hyah ! Let's go !
Get over there ! Get !
Hyah ! Hyah !
Ha ! Come on ! Ha !
Hey, you over there !
Hey, you over there !
Wanna make yourself useful ?
- Hey, Hank.
- Yeah ?
I think you got a volunteer here.
You wanna take care of her ?
Where's Grace ? Grace ?
-  Hyah ! Hyah !
-
-
-
- You okay ?
- Cocktail hour yet ?
- What ?
- I said, is it cocktail hour yet ?
Come here a second.
You handled that pretty well.
I think it's time you started
earning your keep around here.
So when you're not working and
you're not doing your therapy,
I'd like you to help with the horses--
rubbin' 'em, cleanin' the stalls.
Think you can handle that ?
- That's not a question, is it ?
- Nope.
Okay.
Oh-ho !
I was out walkin'
one morning for pleasure
I spied a cowpuncher
come a-lopin' along
His hat was throwed back
and his spurs was a-jinglin'
And as he approached
he was singin' this song
Hey, you little ones. How are you ?
He got a flat
on his little pickup.
You know you're not allowed
to go swimming in the river.
Marie here made the best pie--
cherry pie. Go get some.
As luck would have it, he didn't
have all the lug nuts off,
but the jack slipped and fell
right on that rock he calls a head.
Is he okay ?
Well, it rearranged
his scalp about 12 inches--
He always dreamed of having a place
where he can raise horses...
and have a whole
separate life.
My grandson Joe
is named for him.
Somebody told him about
a place called Stockett.
He got on his horse,
and he rode over there,
and he got off, and he walked
as far as he could one way,
and then he turned around, and he walked
as far as he could to the other.
And then he decided that that's
where he was going to settle.
And that's where we raised
Frank and Tommy.
Where do you call home ?
She's from New York, Mom.
Um... well,
I was born in London.
But I'm from all over, really.
My father was a diplomat,
and so we moved constantly.
Oh, my.
That sounds very important.
He was-- He was a wonderful man.
He died when I was 12, but we,
we lived all over the world.
It-lt's not the same as,
as knowing a place like this.
Well, sometimes people carry it
more on the inside...
than the outside.
You guys done with these ?
This family has quite a history.
Yeah, it's a story, all right.
I love how
she calls him Tommy.
Yeah, always did.
I think she always favored him.
She loves tellin' this story...
about when he was two years old,
he ran off...
and they found him
sleepin' in the barn...
between two giant hooves
of a Percheron stallion.
He said that horse
was protectin' him,
and nobody could
convince him otherwise.
Why do you always
wear that hat ?
'Cause it fits my head.
Wanna try it on ?
What do you want me to do ?
What do you want me to do ?
Hmm ?
What do you call that ?
Okay, one more time.
You gonna sit on me ?
So you can watch this.
I don't wanna do this too many times.
Okay, put your
finger there. Okay ?
Okay ?
Loop's knotted, right ?
Looks like the only way to get it off
is to break the touch, right ?
Now watch. You watchin' ?
Watch carefully.
- Again, again !
- Again, again ! One more time !
Oh, no, no.
I don't fall for that one twice.
- Now you guys get on.
-
Here.
Oh.
What ?
Do you ever sit still
for just a minute ?
Well, you sit still too long
in New York and you get renovated.
Why is it, that sometimes I get
the feeling that you're laughing at me ?
I don't know. Why ?
No. You're supposed to say
you're not laughing at me.
Oh, I see. You take care of
both sides of the conversation, do you ?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker.
Most women have to.
You can call me Tom.
Maybe I am laughin'
a little bit.
I figure, since you're here, it might
be nice to relax into the place a bit.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well, it's beautiful country.
And I could see
having some kind of a,
a vacation place, retreat,
but I don't know
how you do it full-time.
Don't you miss
the rest of the world ?
What's there to miss ?
Well, if you've never lived
in a city with museums,
and theater and, and
restaurants and music--
I-- Well...
I can't explain.
Well, does Chicago count ?
- You lived in Chicago.
- That's where I met my wife.
You, you were, you were married
to a woman in Chicago ?
Yeah, really. A woman.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't, I didn't-- No, I'm so--
I was studying engineering,
and she was studying music--
the cello.
I once heard her play a Dvorak concerto,
and I thought it was...
the most beautiful piece of
music I'd ever heard in my life.
Huh.
So... just who's laughin'
at who here ?
Jogger, huh ?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker.
I run.
That's lucky for you.
The grizzlies around here
mostly go for joggers.
You sleepin' okay
in that house ?
Well, I don't sleep well anyway,
but the house is fine, yeah.
-
- Oop. I have a way with animals.
That's all right. He's just young.
Hold out your hand just a little lower.
That's it. So he can get
the smell of you.
He's beautiful.
- Now how come you don't ride anymore ?
- Hmm ?
Grace told me you used to ride
when she was younger.
She did ?
- Yep.
- Oh. Uh--
I don't know, uh--
No time, I guess.
I thought it was supposed
to be spring.
- Enjoy the day.
- You too.
Come take a ride with me.
- Can you drive ?
-  Drive ? Not old enough.
Well, it's never too soon
to start. Here.
Get in.
Uh, l, I can't.
Come on.
I don't have all day.
Put the key in
and turn it on.
- This one ?
- Mm-hmm.
-
- Now, the right pedal is the gas.
The other one is the brake.
Uh, I don't think l, I can
with my, uh, with my leg.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
Now put it in "D."
Now give it some gas.
Okay, we know you can.
Now you just gotta
feel how much.
Now give--
Try it again.
There you go.
Nice. Real nice.
Now there's a little road
up at the end here. Turn onto it.
Now just follow this.
Nothing to it.
I'm gonna kinda close my eyes
here for a little while,
so keep goin'
till you run out of road.
Uh, l, l,
I don't think I can.
It's not a question if you can.
You are.
Where did you get
Pilgrim from ?
We bought him in Kentucky. Me and my mom
took a trip down there to see him.
That must have been special.
Yeah.
Are you afraid of anything,
Tom Booker ?
Oh, growin' old.
Not bein' much use.
- Hey, Grace ?
- Hmm ?
What went on out there
with Pilgrim ?
See, Grace, I got a problem.
When I work with a horse,
I like to know its history.
Most of the times a horse, in its
own way, can tell you the whole story,
but sometimes they get so messed up in
their head that you need more to go on.
Now I don't know how you feel
about talkin' about it,
and if you don't feel like it,
I understand,
but if I'm gonna figure out
what's goin' on in his head,
sure would help me if I understood
exactly what happened that day.
You know, not today.
Whenever you feel like it.
I'll leave that up to you.
Uh-oh.
- The answer's no.
- You haven't heard the question yet.
Now, the truth is, you'd be
doin' me a real favor.
I got all these young colts
that need ridin'.
Rimrock here, he's--
I mean, he's feelin' kind of left out.
Poor thing.
He'd be grateful, and he'd
take real good care with you.
ls this how you're gonna
make me pay my phone bill ?
No. No, ma'am.
That part's extra.
Oh, brought you a hat.
- Oh, I have a hat.
- I know. I've seen it.
I think my stirrups
are too long or--
- No, they're fine. Relax your center.
- Yeah.
- Just sittin' in a bucket.
- Well, it's all coming back, you know.
I mean, I'll be fine.
Okay, well, then
I'll stop talkin' then.
No, I didn't mean that. I-- You know,
I've never ridden western before.
Yeah, but he doesn't know that.
Just sit the horse.
You have a nice seat,
and you're doing fine.
Thank you.
- You look good. You feel okay ?
- Yeah.
- Wanna pick it up a little ?
- Yeah.
Watch your reins.
Give him some room.
Let him do the work.
- Okay ? You okay ?
- Yep.
Let's go.
I envy your mother.
I do.
It must be great
to be her age...
and to be at that point in life
when you have no more guesswork.
No more impossible decisions
to make.
And anyway, it doesn't matter
because all the worries...
and all the wrong turns that
you made are as valuable and as,
as, as cherished as the things
that you did right.
Must be such a relief.
Must be such peace in that.
I don't think you have to wait to be
her age to find that kind of peace.
Yeah, but how would you know,
unless it was all behind you ?
- Do you have it ?
- Sometimes.
Not all the time,
but sometimes.
When ?
Wakin' up on the ranch
in the morning,
knowin' what
I'm supposed to do that day.
Knowing I'm home.
Hmm.
I wake up every morning,
and I don't know a damn thing. Was l--
Was I right to bring her here,
away from what's familiar--
away from her father,
her friends ?
And the more I try and fix things,
the more everything falls apart.
Maybe you should
let 'em fall.
No, I can't.
Why ?
Do you think
I was right to come ?
I can't answer that, Annie.
Hmm. Well,
I'll know soon enough.
If I've made a mistake,
Grace will let me know.
She's a strong kid.
She gets that from somebody.
Hmm.
Thank you for all you're doing.
You and your family--
Ietting us stay at the house.
It wasn't gettin' much use.
What was your wife like ?
She had reddish hair.
Not, not quite. Almost.
Depended on the light.
She had green eyes.
And when she played,
that was it.
Somethin' just went
right through me.
I'd never heard music
like that played before.
And the way she looked
when she played it.
And then one day, she looked at me
that way, and that was it--
-
- for both of us.
I knew she didn't want to be a rancher's
wife, but I wanted to give it a try.
I thought she could give music lessons
to the kids in town-- the school--
and that our kids would grow up with
my brother's kids and play together.
But...
she wasn't happy here.
"Too much space," she said.
So why didn't you stay
in Chicago ?
Wasn't enough space.
It just wasn't meant to be.
But how did you know...
for sure ?
Knowing's the easy part.
Sayin' it out loud is the hard part.
Mmm. Seems so obvious now,
doesn't it ?
"We weren't right for each other.
If only we knew then."
I didn't love her
'cause it was right.
I just loved her.
For whatever it's worth, Annie, it took
a lot of guts for you to come here.
Lift your leg.
-
-
Come on. Come on.
Hey, Joe.
Hi.
Would you let me
ride your horse ?
Have you talked
to Tom about it ?
Of course I have.
I don't know.
You sure Tom said
it's all right ?
- You gonna give me a hand or what ?
- You sure ?
Come on !
Okay.
Easy. Hold it.
Okay.
-
- Whoa.
Got it. Got it.
I can do it.
Here.
Are you okay ?
Hey ! You better not
say anything !
I thought there were
too many forks, so I just, um--
Oh, you look really pretty.
Thanks.
Does anybody want
something to drink ?
-
-  Shit !
-
- Shh !
- I better go give your mom a hand.
- Oh, yeah.
- Everything under control here ?
- Um, no, not really.
Uh, it's been so long
since I've done this.
I've forgotten. And I couldn't
find any Parmesan cheese.
Well, you got an easy crowd
out there as long as it's hot.
Can I do anything ?
Uh, just make yourself
comfortable.
I am comfortable.
Well, um, in that case,
you can bring in the... pasta.
You missed a button.
Thank you.
You know, I'll have another round
of that spaghetti, if I may.
- Oh, of course.
-  Thank you.
I, uh, like the sauce.
Maybe I could get the recipe ?
It's from a jar.
Oh.
Well, now, you know what.
I, uh, used jar sauce once.
I don't believe
it was near as good as this.
- Isn't that right, Frank ?
- No.
No. You know, I think you gotta know
which brand to pick.
I sure would like
the name of this one.
Mm-hmm.
Annie, you've given me
a rare night off.
Ooh, you're touchin'
on a sore subject here.
Diane's got these big dreams in her head
about gettin' away to-- What was it ?
- Greece, Morocco ?
- Morocco.
One of these places
where women wear masks...
and everybody's runnin'
around in robes and--
Well, we could use a vacation.
Well, we're goin'
to Branson for the wedding.
-You just had a turn.
-You don't know how to play these games.
- Hey !
- Yes, I do.
- You do not.
- You know, Frank.
You know, Branson, Missouri,
is not exactly Morocco.
I got family there.
Got no family in Morocco
as far as I know.
- It's my turn.
- You had a turn.
- It was not !
- Was so !
- Settle down.
- You're just showin' off for--
-  Shut up, stupid.
- You're the only one who's stupid.
Lettin' her go
and fall off your horse.
You little turd.
I saw them.
Her tryin' to get on Gonzo.
- You turd !
- Joe !
- Did you go riding ?
-  No !
-  Get up off the floor.
-  Out you go. Now !
-  I didn't start it.
-  Right now. Come on.
Annie, I'm so sorry.
They're just tired.
We should get them home to bed.
Say good night and thank you.
- Annie, dinner was delicious.
- Thank you so much.
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.
Joe, did Grace try to ride ?
I expect you should talk
to Grace about that, ma'am.
If I did anything wrong,
I'm sorry.
Mm-hmm.
Don't let her turn you away.
Grace.
Is everything all right ?
- Did you try riding again ?
- Yeah.
Does that mean I'm cured ?
Nobody's trying to cure you.
Look, I just wanna say I think
it's great that you're riding again.
And I think I know why
you needed to--
Yeah, you know everything.
Stop it. Why won't you
let me talk to you ?
Why are you
so angry with me ?
Whatever I do, it's wrong.
Whatever I say, it's wrong.
Yeah ? Well, now
you know how it feels.
Look, I know that
I'm hard on you sometimes.
- Right !
- Sorry if that makes you feel this way.
But if I push you,
it's only because--
Because if I'm your perfect daughter,
that makes you the perfect mother ?
I don't deserve that !
I don't push for me.
I push for you so that
you don't spend half your life...
not knowing where you belong.
Yeah ? Well,
you've done a great job.
Yeah.
Who's ever gonna
want me like this ?
Oh.
Who's ever gonna want me
like this ? Nobody will.
It sometimes doesn't seem this way,
but I do understand what you're feeling.
It sometimes doesn't seem this way,
but I do understand what you're feeling.
When I was your age
and when my dad died,
I felt like I'd lost everything
and I'd be all alone.
And... but I've got you.
I used to pray every night...
that you and Dad
would have another kid,
so I wouldn't have
to be so... special.
I know.
And I know how-- how hard it must be
to have lost your best friend...
and have your body be different
than from how you'd like it to be.
But one day...
somebody will look at this extraordinary
woman that you're becoming...
all they'll see is
how much they love you.
That's all I see.
-Yep ?
-Hello, this is AT&T Conference Service.
- Is this Annie MacLean ?
- Yes.
I have a conference call scheduled for
you with Mr. Gottschalk and Mr. Felton.
Mr. Felton.
Hold on, please.
Okay, I'm ready.
-
-
I've been waiting
for you to come back.
You hungry ?
Judith was, um,
telling me about this boy.
I never even got his name.
We were gonna go around
the railroad bridge.
We were laughing about something.
I don't know what.
And, um, her horse fell,
and Judith's foot
was caught in the stirrup.
And she was so scared.
And next I saw this truck
coming around the turn.
And it was honking,
trying to get us to move.
And l-- I tried
to grab her reins and...
to get her horse
to move out of the way.
And the truck
started to skid.
And there was no time
to do anything and--
It ran right into Judith.
And she just disappeared.
And then it came
at Pilgrim and me.
And Pilgrim reared up
at the truck.
And I fell off.
But Judith--
Oh, God, Judith.
- I'm so sorry, Judith.
- Grace !
Now, I'm not gonna tell ya
it's gonna stop feelin' this bad.
But I will tell you
you didn't do anything wrong.
Same thing could have happened
to me or to Frank or to Joey.
And it doesn't make any sense to try
to figure out why these things happen.
There was a boy from
the Blackfeet reservation.
He used to do some work around here for
a while. Sixteen, strong kid, good kid.
He and I were
really, really good friends.
One day he went swimmin'
and dove headfirst into the lake.
Hit right into a rock
and snapped his neck.
Paralyzed him.
And after the accident,
I'd look in on him
from time to time.
But he wasn't there.
Like his mind, his spirit, whatever
you want to call it, just disappeared.
The only thing left
was just anger.
Sort of if the boy I once knew
just went somewhere else.
I know where he goes.
I know you do.
Don't you disappear.
You do whatever you have
to do to hold on.
I'll tell you
one more thing.
You know when Pilgrim reared up
against that truck ?
You know what I think ?
I think that damned horse loved you
so much he was tryin' to protect you.
That's what I think.
How'd you get like this ?
No, no, no. Get up.
Let me show you.
- Wanna see it again ?
- Yep.
- Can you do it without smiling ?
- Yep.
No, you can't. Not possible.
I can feel the muscles--
- Try me.
- I can feel the muscles--
-
-
It must be nice to have
a few days off work, huh ?
Yeah. Yeah.
It's more than a few days though.
I'm not an editor anymore.
First time
I said it out loud.
They fired ya ?
No, no, it's more like a--
Yeah. They fired me.
You don't seem
too upset about it.
It's delayed shock
or maybe not.
I'm sure I can talk my way back in there
or get another magazine someplace.
But maybe I don't-- I'm just
not sure l-- I'm not sure I want to.
Well, I guess you don't have to
figure it out till you get home.
See, when you hit
like a windmill ?
It's not gonna do any good.
But if you hit down,
like you hit a golf club--
You come back, down.
Down into it.
Did you always know
this was the life you wanted ?
Well, I was
a rancher's daughter.
I guess it's not too far to go
to becomin' a rancher's wife. Yeah.
Huh. Frank's a good man.
Oh, they don't come better.
I don't deny there are times I think
about all the things I won't have.
Maybe I'll get to see Morocco.
Probably not.
Did Tom have many girlfriends
after his divorce ?
Hey, look, Annie,
I'm not good at this sort of talk.
Goes round and round somethin'
and never gets to it,
so let's just
say what it is.
Tom means so much
to this family.
Don't you go lookin' here
for whatever it is you're lookin' for.
Don't make that man
go through somethin'...
that took him so long to see
his way clear of in the first place.
I don't think Tom would do
anything he didn't want to do.
Yeah. He's a good man.
Ooh, he's got a gift.
Comes from heaven above, I swear.
But he's still just a man.
Bitter raindrops glisten
On the painted
lnjun flower
Honey child, the moon
Loves you true
The muddy road
is brown and still
As far as you can see
Honey child
The noontime is
Couldn't, um--
There's something
I need to know.
Are you sure ?
Gotta get back.
Dad ?
Dad !
Diane. It's a pleasure.
Welcome.
- Diane.
- Hello.
- Frank.
- Hello, Frank.
- This is our oldest boy, Joe.
- Hi, Joe.
- And this is Mr. Booker.
- Tom.
- Hi, Tom.
- It's a pleasure.
And I want to thank you
for the way you took in my girls here.
I can already see a difference
in them. Very grateful to ya.
Dad. Dad, did you notice ?
No cane.
I know.
That is amazing.
- Could we show him Pilgrim ?
- You bet.
- Let's go get your bags.
-  Need a hand, Annie ?
See ya later.
So at this point
I'm pretty sure I'm lost.
So I stop by this general store and ask
if anyone knows the Booker ranch.
This nice, uh, older gentleman with a
bandage on his head gave me directions.
-
- Sweet Jesus.
That's Henry Vanoker.
I'm surprised you didn't
wind up in Mexico.
Well, once when, uh, Dad was
in lndia, he got lost...
way, way up in these mountains.
When he finally found his way back,
everyone said he discovered a new route.
And they redid all the maps.
Well, now, how'd you
end up in lndia, Robert ?
Oh, this was right after college.
I was in the Peace Corps.
Well, that's where
he met Mom.
Hey, tell 'em about when
Mom went looking for Tubab.
- No, l--
- Dad. Come on, Dad.
Well, Mom was a writer,
and, um, Dad knows the rest.
She was a journalist
for an English periodical.
- What was it called ?
- Cambridge Monthly.
Right. And she decided to go to lndia
all by herself without knowing a soul.
Uh, she had no place to stay.
But she was-- she was
told to look up Tubab.
- Tubab ?
- She comes to my door--
suitcase and typewriter--
and asks where Tubab is,
and I said, "Right here."
And she said, "You're Tubab ?"
I said, "No, my name is Robert.
Tubab means white man,
and, yes, I am."
And that was how we met.
Small bed. Maybe I should
sleep in the barn.
You're allergic to hay.
I-- I apologize
for the surprise.
But the days only opened yesterday,
and I figured that--
You don't have to apologize.
You have every right
to be here.
You were right
to bring her here.
Well, there have been plenty
of times I wasn't so sure.
You must be tired, huh ?
Yeah.
And out here-- I'll show you.
- Sorry about that.
- Oh, that's okay.
I can't believe
it's the same horse.
We still have a ways to go.
So--
How much longer do you think ?
Like I told your wife,
it's really up to Pilgrim.
Uh-huh.
Dad, will you come dance ?
Please, Dad !
Daylight has found me
Here again
You can ask me anything
But where I've been
You should know the reason
Why I called
I was lookin'
for a soft place
To fall
Lookin' for a soft place
Nothin' more
than a small taste
Of a love that ended
Long ago
Lookin' for
a place to hide
A warm bed on a cold night
I didn't mean to hurt you
No, no, no
Lookin' out your window
At the dawn
Baby, when you wake up
I'll be gone
You're the one
who taught me
After all
How to find a soft place
To fall
The summer is really very brief.
After I doctor those foals,
you want me to put them
in the upper or lower pasture ?
- Well, upper.
-  That's very short.
You grew up here ?
This is where you're from ?
I wasn't born here.
- So winter is real--
- I asked Annie-- She didn't know.
That's the time
you gotta feed cattle...
and hope the majority
of 'em survive.
Is this how
it's gonna be now, hmm ?
You don't speak to me ?
We don't speak to each other ?
Well, I'm speaking to you now,
so say something.
- No.
- Why?
- I can't get in the middle of this.
- You are in the middle of this.
- He's a good man, Annie.
- I never said he wasn't.
- I can't change the way I feel.
- You gotta figure out what you want.
- Do you know what you want ?
- I do know what I want.
And I'm tryin' real hard
not to get lost in this.
I never expected
to feel this way again.
Annie, this is where I belong.
This is who I am.
Is this what you want ?
Yeah.
Are you sure ?
Yeah.
Can you tell that to your family ?
To Robert ? To Grace ?
If you had a chance to go home
and change things, would you ?
You can't ask me that.
It's not that simple.
It is.
It's not fair.
No, it's not fair.
There's something
you gotta do tomorrow, boy.
It'll be okay, Grace.
Just hang on there a minute or two.
Tom will get him all right.
- What are you doing ?
- Gonna have to do something different.
It's not gonna hurt him, right ?
Nothin' we've done
has hurt him.
Grace, this is Pilgrim's chance,
and it's yours too.
Okay.
Let him get everything ready.
Come on, Grace.
Come along.
Come on.
That's enough ! Stop !
Grace, this is
where you come in.
No.
Come on.
Okay, I want you
to get down here, Grace.
Grace. I want you to come
over here and sit next to me.
- But-- But why would he let me--
- Grace, look at him.
Look at him.
He's okay, and you never
did anything to let him down.
- No--
- Grace, listen to me.
- No, I can't.
- Grace, you've got to do this.
Trust me
just one more time.
Do what ?
I want you to come over here
and sit next to me.
Start right here where the neck is and
the head, and I want you to stroke him.
I want you to rub him
and feel him all over.
That's it.
-
- That's it.
That's it. Go on ahead.
Grace, now we're going to show Pilgrim
here how to help you get on him.
Because, you see, there's a point where
neither of you is gonna need me anymore.
And we're there.
I'm not askin'.
Put your leg over the saddle here.
That a girl.
Now we're gonna rock him up.
Oh.
- Dad.
- Honey, you were wonderful.
Hey there. Gettin' ready
to go home, are ya ?
Mm-hmm. Is Tom around ?
No, he went to Sheridan to get
some horses. He left last night.
Um, when's he coming back ?
Oh, I don't rightly know.
Let me know when you need
some help loadin' Pilgrim, okay ?
Yeah.
- What time's your flight ?
- 12:15.
Bookers want to leave
for the airport by 9:30.
Sure you want to
drive Pilgrim back ?
Well, I already know the way. It's not
like I have a job to rush home to.
To tell you the truth,
I could use the time alone.
When you planning to start ?
Oh, I guess I'll leave
when you and Grace go.
May I make a suggestion ?
What ?
Take your time.
What's the matter ?
You look like there's something wrong.
I'll tell you something, Annie.
I stood there
looking at that horse,
and I swear I felt like
the same thing was happening to me.
And I have two choices.
I can either fight
the way things are...
or accept them.
See, um,
I always knew
I loved you more.
Didn't bother me.
I guess I felt kind of lucky,
a little amazed that...
a woman like you would want
to be with a man like me.
And I guess I thought
if I could do everything right--
If I could-- If I was the best husband
I could be, the best father,
even being a good lawyer only mattered
because of what it meant for us.
If I could do all that,
it wouldn't make any difference...
if we loved each other
the same or not.
I didn't ask for more.
I told myself
I didn't need any more.
But...
the truth is, you don't
know how you feel about me.
You don't know if you want
a life with me anymore.
And the truth is...
I don't want you to come
home until you do know...
one way or the other.
Okay ?
- Thanks, Joe.
- Yep.
Bye, Annie.
Good luck to ya.
Thank you.
And you too.
All right, everybody in.
Frank, we all set ?
I believe so.
I can't believe he's
not here to say good-bye.
Oh, he probably
got held up is all.
No, sweetie, the truth is,
he's not real good at good-byes.
You know, come to think of it,
not too good at hellos either.
- You ready ?
- Just a second.
- Mmm !
- When will you be home ?
- Oh, in a few days.
- I'll miss you.
Well, if I get lost, you know
where to send the search party.
- Could be just about anywhere.
-
I'll call you, okay ?
-
- Bye.
Bye.
He goin' back inside the trailer
or runnin' alongside it ?
I just wanted to be here
when you left.
I don't want to leave you.
I don't want you to.
Just a few more days.
- And then ?
- Oh.
Why did this happen ?
I don't ask
those questions, Annie.
And I didn't ask
to love you, but I do.
- Oh !
- I'll always have that with me.
Tom.
Can we go for
one last ride, hmm ?
Yeah. I'll saddle 'em up.
