I don't know a recent Saturday
I've sold more
Why are you so glum?
Were you bothered
by those waitresses
making a fuss?
No, but what are you
supposed to do
when people keep commenting
on your looks?
I don't even know
what they mean...
"Beat them off
with a stick"
Well, if that's
your only problem
It's not
I got my report card
Three C's, two D's
and an incomplete
I see you studying
so hard, Tom
What do you think
the problem is?
I just have to
try harder
And I will
I will
I will I will
I will, I will, I will!
I will I will!
Thanks, Dad
This talk helped
Can you, um
sign it, please?
Do you think
a tutor would help?
That'd be great
It'd better help
What can you do
with yourself
if all you can do
is look good?
I'm frequently asked
what special difficulties
are involved
in being graduated
from high school
two months shy
of my 15th birthday
I sometimes think
the difficulties themselves
enabled me to do it
If I'd been appreciated,
or even tolerated
I wouldn't have been
in such a hurry to graduate
I hope the next student
who excels
isn't made to feel
so much an outcast
But I'm looking forward
to college
and this is
the happiest day I've had
in a long, long time
So, I thank you
and I forgive you
- Come on!
- Slug him!
Yeah!
Go ahead
This will heal!
What I'm going to say
can never be erased!
It'll scar you forever!
Ready? Here it is
You'll never make
more than $19,000 a year!
Cream him!
Take him
OK!
What about this?
You'll never leave
South Boston
I'll see the whole damn world!
You'll never know the pleasure
of writing
a graceful sentence
or having
an original thought!
Think about it!
$19,000 Not bad!
Dear Felicio:
It's truly amazing to me
that we live a world apart
and yet have
the same favorite music
I love the picture
you sent me
and have it up on
and have it...
and have it up
on my bulletin board
Honey
Aah!
Good God, Jane!
Daddy!
Don't ever do that to me!
It's time for you
to go to sleep
I just have
two more pen pals
Finish quickly
I don't want you
getting obsessive
about these things
Good night
All right
Obsessive
Obsessive
Dad, you want me
to choose my words
so carefully,
then you throw a word
like "obsessive" at me
Now, unless I'm wrong
obsession is practically
a psychiatric term
concerning people
who don't have anything else
but the object
of their own obsession
who can't stop and
do anything else
Well, I'm stopping
to say this
so be more precise
instead of calling a person
something like "obsessive"!
Good night
Hey, it's me
You have to meet me
in 30 minutes
Nudge your mate
I don't think
there's time to eat
but there's probably
a cafeteria at the bus depot
I love working with you two
It saves me a call
Yeah
Hey
Arnold Schwarzenegger is
on all three networks
I think he's live
on two of them
The Wake-Up News
used the wrong missile graphic
And they want us to take
even cheaper rooms
Arnold said he's making
$3 million a movie,
but he's not ever gonna change
He's still the same person
when he was making
$2 million a movie
He also bought
a condo with Maria
They're gonna
furnish tastefully
Ha ha ha!
Half-hour in the lobby
I'll see you
in the lobbies
There he is
Hi I'd like
to talk to you
for a second
Just a few questions
No
I came from Washington
Move away from me
"There might be a band
at the bus depot
for JD Singer's
return from war
He was decorated
for heroism..."
Watch this
How does it feel
being home?
Get the fuck lost
Fuck Fuck
Fucking!
Fucking!
You want to use that?
Depends on how big
a news day it is
I can't believe
you said that!
I'm very proud of that
He really opened up to you
If this were a war
the United States sanctioned
World War II or Vietnam...
You really
ought to work
on your speech
It makes me nervous
to think about it
Let's do this
I'm not expecting
any big homecoming
We are being
increasingly influenced
by the star system
The network anchormen
are so powerful
they comprise
our last best hope
Our profession is in danger
Ahem
So, where do you want to go eat?
The current group
is clearly qualified
tied still
to our best traditions
but who follows these men?
Excuse me
We are being pressured
to take a loyalty oath
Wow
I've known
so many women like that
They don't like their looks,
so they're angry
Excuse me
All of you know
what I'm talking about
We're all trying to act
tougher than we are
but we care, so
we're all secretly terrified
by what's happening
aren't we?
Ah-choo!
Catch you later
I was going to talk
about other trends, but
magazine shows,
news as profit
the historic influence
of Entertainment Tonight
the danger, the hope
the dream, the question
Oh! I was going
to show you a tape
a story carried by all networks
on the same night
the same night
that not one network noted
a major policy change
in SALT II
nuclear disarmament talks
Here's what they ran instead
Please show the tape
I know it's good film
I know it's fun
I like fun
It's just not news
Well, you're lucky you love it
You'll get a lot more
just like it
Good
Thank you
I don't think
there'll be any Q and A
I think it's over
I'm going to get
a bite to eat
Hi
Hello
I just wanted to tell you
how great you were
My name's Tom Grunick
Thank you
Yeah
They hated me
I don't hate them
Well, they say
if you can reach
even one person,
it means something
And you did that
Would you like to
have dinner with me?
Sure
Another thing
I can't stand...
Is this dull?
No! No, no No No
Another thing
I can't stand
is when White House reporters
bullshit with each other
after a briefing,
and one of them has a theory
and the other quotes it
in his story as
"White House sources say"
That actually goes on?
Yes!
I am not tired
You want to talk in my room?
Sure
Aw, come on
Even I'm not that hard
on myself
No, really
I got this job
on a fluke
and wait till you hear
how it ends up
I was doing sports
at this station
The newspaper ran
this untrue story
that I was leaving
and they got
these tons of protest mail
Ha ha ha!
So...
So they made me anchor
So, great Right?
Except I'm no good
at what I'm being
a success at
How are you at back rubs?
It's normal,
the way you feel
In graduate school,
everyone thought
the admissions committee
made a mistake
in letting them in
You think I lack confidence
That's not it
I know I can talk well enough
and I can make contact
with people
but I don't
like the feeling
that I'm pretending
to be a reporter
And half the time
I don't get the news
I'm talking about
It's not that
I'm down on myself
Trust me
I stink!
I trust you
I didn't even
have a chance
to become really good
at sports
I wasn't bad
What about
the obvious remedy...
reversing things,
maybe working at a newspaper
I don't write
Ha ha!
But that didn't stop me
from sending
my audition tapes
to the bigger stations
and the networks
Well, come on
It is your life
Nobody is tying you
to the fast track
Did you go to college?
So you're not
well-educated
you have almost
no experience
and you can't write
Yeah, and I'm
and I'm making a fortune
It's hard for me
to advise you
since you
personify something
that I truly think
is dangerous
Uh-huh
I agree that you're
not qualified
so get qualified
Insist on being
better prepared
Don't just leave it
with, " Uh
I don't write,
I'm not schooled
I don't understand the news
but at least
I'm upset about it"
Whoa
What do you want from me
permission to be a fake?
Stop whining
Do something about it!
Um
you don't have to
start right now
I hated the way you
talked to me just now
and it wasn't just because
you were right
Oh, God Ha ha ha!
Oh, God
Oh, God
Oh!
No, no, no
It wasn't just the speech
The same thing happened
with this guy
I have passed
some line someplace
I am beginning
to repel people
I'm trying to seduce
He must've been great-looking
Why?
Nobody invites
a bad-looking idiot
to their bedroom
OK, let's do me
I feel like I'm slipping
but do people
who are slipping feel that way
or do the good people
who are moving up
invariably think
they're slipping
because their standards
are so high?
This conversation
is not worthy of you
I wish that were true
Good night
Wouldn't it be great
if insecurity
and desperation
made us more attractive?
If needy were a turn-on?
Call if you get weird
Hmm?
Take care, doll
I will
I was just thinking
it was our shortest
phone conversation ever
I never told you
the reason I was
telling you everything
Those audition tapes I sent...
I've been hired
by your network
for the Washington bureau
so I'll probably
see you at work
What?
Sorry
They didn't hire
Peter Stiller from The Times
and he had a great
audition tape
They can't take on
people like this
for network news
What is going on?
Newsroom
Wait a minute
Yes, jerry, hold on
Play it back
OK, what about this?
Here's a tough ethical one
Would you tell a source
you love them
just to get information?
- Yes
- Yes
- Me, too
- Sure
Jennifer didn't know
there was an alternative
Ha ha ha!
Here's a good one
They let us have cameras
at an execution in Florida
Do you broadcast tape
of the guy
when they turn on
the voltage?
- Sure
- You bet
- Why not?
- Absolutely
Nothing like wrestling
with a moral dilemma
Speak to you later
Bobby, go to 9:45:46
the soundbite
that starts
"Why were you in Angola?"
We could go all...
Please, Bobby!
We're pushing
Why were you in Angola?
Politics? Money?
What brings you to these places?
That's where the job's at
That's what I get paid for
They said I should observe
We're working here!
You can stand...
Play the last line
Thanks
Bobby, let me hear it
Jane! We need it
in 14 minutes
Just a second
Let me hear it
What did you expect
when you came back?
It's a long time
since I've seen my folks
but I'm not expecting
any big homecoming
Stop there
I want to shoot
The Homecoming
from a Norman Rockwell book
I have in the office
You don't have time!
I'll be right down
I have to tell Ernie
because there isn't
enough time!
Yes, there is!
I don't think
she's going to make it
Ha ha ha!
It was a surprise
You want copy?
Yes, doll, 15 seconds
Just a 2-second dissolve
to the Rockwell
Should l...
Just a 2-second dissolve!
We have three minutes!
Why do you do this to me?
Is it because
I won an award?
Homecoming...
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait
The return of a fighting man
has always been
a moving ceremony of war
We have 11/2 minutes
I have to tell New York
we're not ready
We'll be ready
In 84 seconds?
Lay it in, Bobby
The screen will be black
because we're not there!
What about careers, huh?
We won't make it!
Whoops
Whoops?
Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby
Oh, God!
Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby
Blair!
You got it!
We'll make it, Blair!
Oh! Oh!
Go!
Uh! Uh!
Hey, watch it there!
Whoa!
Open the damn door!
Thank you!
Hey!
Ow!
Fighting inside
the perimeter
Tell New York
we won't be ready
There she is
OK Stand by
Here!
Take it!
Was there
In other times
there might be a band
at the bus depot
Guys
Homecoming...
Norman Rockwell's
enduring portrait
The return of a fighting man
has always been
a moving ceremony of war
Tearful women, proud men
excited children
But JD Singer was right
His homecoming
was no big deal
Aaron Altman,
Lincoln, Nebraska
An American comes home
That's your news
I'm Bill Rorish
Good evening
Look at that smile
That was good work
His, uh
Bill smiled
He liked it
Bill loved it
That's a big smile
Bill hasn't smiled
like that in weeks!
Good piece
Thanks, Ernie
I got to see it again
He did smile
Ha ha ha!
Don't tell anyone
I did this
I'm sorry if I got
in the way
It was totally impressive!
It was just
a great piece!
You weren't
Thanks
How does it feel?
I can't believe
I'm here
Where did Martin go?
Downstairs
I can't believe I'm here
No, I'm wrong
He went to research
I can't believe I'm here!
If you're through work now...
No Aaron and I go
to Central America
on Wednesday,
so I am cramming
I thought you were
incredible in there
Everybody was
I have a lot to learn
I would really
a lot appreciate it...
"Really a lot
appreciate it"?
You make me nervous
Anyway
if I can pick
your brain, if
I can't help you
Sorry
I'm not here to teach
remedial reporting
It has nothing to do
with the fact
that I left your room
instead of staying?
Oh!
Ha!
Please!
You're going to have to
understand something
This isn't personal
OK
Good night
Good night
OK, OK
Esta bien
Si
Gracias
Oye
Para un americano
no habla mal espanol
Really? I'm sure
you speak English
very well, too
He says they've engaged
the Sandinistas regularly
He expects shooting tonight
If anything happens to me
tell every woman
I've ever dated
I was talking about her
at the end
They'll have to
re-evaluate me
Put on the boot
No! Manny, no!
No Stop, stop, stop
We're not here
to stage the news
Wait and see
what they do
Sir, you can do
whatever you want
It's your choice
OK
He just said he's scared
OK, let's get this
It's too dark
No, it's not
Just go!
Aaron, go
The first shots were fired
not 10 seconds ago
from over there,
towards the east
The Contras feel
they must be outnumbered
That's a given
They've managed
to hold their ground
despite the fact
that their weapons
have been acting up
No new shipment of arms
is expected
until tomorrow
All they got today were shoes
Great line at the end
Did you get
a shot of the boots?
Of course
I can't believe
I just risked my life
for a network
that tests my face
with focus groups!
I don't feel good
Ha ha ha!
The proposal stipulates
electing a president
from among
several candidates
Graphic on
in two seconds
Hi
How's it going?
CC, we need
control of 5
chosen by
the military command
A firefight
along the Nicaraguan border
when we return
Audio is up full
The first shots were fired
not 10 seconds ago
from over there,
towards the east
Freeze
Freeze it back over
Congratulations, you two
Finally got
a piece in early, huh?
Bill saw it earlier
He loved it
No kidding?
No one's checked the spelling
on these chyrons
There's a guy downstairs
Clerk vouched for him
He has something to say
about gays
getting promotions at State
Could I buy you
dinner sometime?
I just got back
I don't know
which end is up
OK
Jane!
Bill Rorish
is asking for you
I've never heard of him
handing out compliments
during a show
Jane, if it gets
any better than that
I'll have to
bring you up here
to New York
Thanks I wish you'd kept
the first 20 seconds
But thank you
Well, the visual
with the shoes at the end
was just perfect
He loved the boots!
Aaron should hear this
so I have another witness
You always want to give
the credit away, don't you?
No He happens
to deserve the credit
He's right here
I'll speak to you soon
He had to read over
some new copy
What?
Can I watch you
tape that interview downstairs?
Yes
Thanks
The Contras have
only a few months
Laugh so they don't think
I'm dying inside
but have so much style
that I just said
something funny
Ha ha ha!
What did he say?
Ha ha ha!
Oh, I'll never tell
the Contras, who are
creeping back into action
I once made
some stupid remark
about his hairline
He'll never forget it!
OK I'll meet
the crew there
Could you give me
that address
one more time?
Right
Yeah, it's good
to finally be
getting to work
Right Like the state
Yeah
Got it
Yeah Bye
Jane, I've got a story
Jane?
Hi How are you?
Wait
I need you
I got a story
Some public official
skipped a week
on his Christmas club?
The House
Armed Services Committee
has a secret report
which says that
the Allen Fighting Vehicle
the army poured
a fortune into
plain won't work
They have $5 million
in this thing already
Billion
Right, billion
OK Of course
They said I could have
any producer I want
and I want you
One committee source called it
a $5 billion metal sculpture
too ugly to look at
and too big to bury
Over time, however,
costs have doubled
Did you write this?
I write for you sometimes
Not because you have to
firepower to defend itself
against enemy tanks
The suspension system
had to be redesigned
because of the vehicle's
extra weight
The Allen can carry
only six infantrymen
Oh, come on
the vehicle to sink
in shallow water
General Elton McGuire
is in charge
of the weapons system
General, I don't want
to bother you anymore
Tom rates two cameras, huh?
Tomorrow you'll see
a mob of me here
If you have
anything to say, sir
say it now,
the way you want
It's great you left in
what you said
Yes, please,
let's never forget
we're the real story
not them
Yeah, I know
I couldn't decide about it
He's not afraid
of being human
Shh!
Before the House
Armed Services Committee
Tom Grunick, the Pentagon
As if the Pentagon
didn't have enough problems
Thanks, Jane
Sure
Tom? My youngest
wanted to meet you
This is Elli
Hi, Elli
You should be honored
She never wanted to
meet anyone here before
Dad
But she said
she loved you
on television just now
Hi, Elli
Remember me?
L-I'm not sure
I'm sorry
I've been to your house
Aaron was on that
with us last year
Oh, yeah
I wore a big
yellow raincoat
Oh, yeah
It had a hood
Yeah! Hi!
Your hair's different
Yeah
Hi!
Hi, Elli She knows me
Hi, Dad
Did you see it?
Great
I'll send you a tape
I'm sorry
I haven't called
Things got a
little bumpy for a while
No, it's not important
I'm fine
Hey, Dad
I think I just may be able
to do this job
Ha ha ha!
Well, I'm glad
you were sure!
Ah
Our host!
Come on in
Sorry we're late
It's Jane’s fault
Smells good
It is good
Anne worked all weekend
Why should we feel
defensive about it?
Newspapers are in business
to make money Why not us?
They criticize us
for pandering
while they run
Wingo games
Exactly right
Excuse me
I'm paid to mix
Ha ha!
Good-bye, Paul
Take care, Paul
It takes courage
to say that
to the news division
president
You think anyone
who's proud of our work
is an ass kisser
No
I think anyone who
puckers their lips
and smooches
their boss's buttocks
is an ass kisser
My gosh!
For a while there,
I was attracted to you
Well, wait a minute
That changes everything
They wouldn't renew
my magazine subscription
because of money
I can't believe it
Ha ha ha!
Martin, would you
excuse us for a minute?
No
Go away
Well, you know,
I've been meaning
to ask you
Ah, forget it
This is very awkward
I see Tom around you a lot
I'd like to see him
outside of work
unless there's some reason
for you to mind
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Do I mind?
Why would I mind? No
Wait
I do mind
I think about him
outside of work sometimes
but I know
I don't respect him
What am I talking about?
What am I saying?
You're saying,
"Stay away from him"
I can't be
We don't have to
settle this right now
Wait a minute
This is slippery
I will call you
I'll call you
from the other room right now
I've studied these things
Tell me one person
who ever left television news
to work on a newspaper
Right
It sure looks good
After all these years
we have a life
See you
See you
Hey
Hi, Tom
Hi
It's the first time
I've seen you
dressed like this
You look so clean
and pretty
What do you mean?
Clean?
At the office
you have this film over you
I've got to find someone
It's important
Excuse me
Jennifer
Hey!
Jennifer!
Forget what I said
Do whatever you
want to with Tom
There's nothing
I'm going to do
right this second
It's your day off
You're entitled
You weren't
really leaving
Yes
You were?
Yes
No!
He thought it was funny
Hi!
A plane shot up
an air base in Sicily
This could be very, very...
That's it!
OK, right away
Ernie?
Tom? Tom
Yeah
What is it?
A Libyan plane
just shot up
one of our bases in Sicily
We should tap our source
Jennifer, we need you
Jane, we want you
to exec produce
a special report
A Libyan plane shot up
an American base in Sicily
Since Paul is here
he's made the assignments...
Jennifer at the White House
George at the Pentagon,
Martin at State
We need an anchor
since Rorish is on his boat
We're doing the report
from here with Tom
What?
You're not going to
use him at all?
It's not my choice
It's 1:35,
and it's Tom
You can reach me
at the office
Paul, forgive me
I'm really sorry
Pardon me
for interrupting, but
Paul, I need to
talk to you outside
Great
Tom's not near ready
for this job
not by the longest shot
Aaron spent
six weeks in Tripoli
He's interviewed Qaddafi
He reported on the '81 story
He's essential
to do our best job
It's my responsibility
to say so
That's your opinion
I don't agree
It's not opinion
You're just absolutely right
and I'm absolutely wrong
It must be nice
to always believe
you're right
to always think
you're the smartest person
in the room
No, it's awful
You'd better get going
Hey!
Would you come on?
Nervous?
Excited
Tell George and jennifer
to try and cover everything
without Tom having to ask
OK Bobby says...
Did you hear what I said?
Take a breath
And most important
make sure his earpiece works
Have backups ready
That's never been more vital
He must be able to hear me
Get a picture
of E-2 Hawkeyes
I can put on the feed prompt
We're going to the White House
Tom
We have 20 minutes
You can wait
in the studio
I got Tom's copy
Ahem
Aghh!
Stand by, animation
Ready VTR 1 and 2
Ready to announce
Ready on camera 1 with cue
Stand by
Good luck, kid
Ready
I need five
Six
Everyone here
is programmed clearly?
Yeah, everyone's good
Executive producer
Wow!
How many seconds to air?
Stand by, camera 1
Camera 2, center it up
A little left
Tom, can you hear me?
Tom, can you hear me?
Tom?
Tom Tom!
Tom? Tom!
Damn it!
He can't hear me!
I can hear you
I was just teasing
and announce
Cue him with effects
Good afternoon
A Libyan fighter plane
attacked a US
military installation
at Comiso, Sicily,
at 1007 am,
Eastern time
The Libyan MIG-21
was shot down
by American F-14 jets
The base,
a US naval air station
There are 500 men and women
stationed there
The Libyan bombs
destroyed a warehouse
which 30 minutes earlier
had been crowded
with servicemen
Bought a one-way
ticket back
One-way ticket back
I can sing
while I read
I am singing
and reading both
Leavin'
On that midnight train
to Georgia
Leavin'on
that midnight train
The Libyan MIG-21
dropped all four of its bombs
on the US air station
The heat-seeking missiles
virtually disintegrated
the plane
I'd rather live
in his world
Than live without him
All remotes,
stand by, please
Ah-choo!
George, you ready?
Yeah Should I
cover everything
or should I let Tom
ask me something?
Cover everything
We're going to George
Say, "The joint Chiefs
are meeting
We have George Weln
at the Pentagon"
to better monitor
the situation
George Weln
is at the Pentagon
and reports
that the attack
has triggered
a massive movement
of US military might
A lot of alliteration
from anxious anchors
placed in powerful posts!
Was this the work
of a dissident pilot
or was the pilot
acting on instructions?
We now have Qaddafi
on the screen
It's Aaron
Yes?
The pilot that shot down
the Libyan in 1981
is stationed right here
Tell Tom the F-14
is extremely hard to fly
and they're
nicknamed Tomcats
Thank you
Said Qaddafi
"This is not war"
The F-14 is
extremely difficult to master
They're called Tomcats
Isn't the F-14 Tomcat
extremely difficult
for a pilot to master?
In the seventies,
the first craft had many crashes
There was trouble
with them in the seventies
Thank you, George
I say it here,
it comes out there
Jennifer?
The White House
is preparing
All right,
stand by, please
Hi
Qaddafi doesn't foam
at the mouth or anything
When you speak to him
he seems not at all nuts
He seems like a leader
Good We're getting
the '81 pilot
Nobody else will have him
What's it like
being executive producer?
I got to go
Me, too Got to go
Got to go
We're very busy
Stand by, camera 1
Center up
We're going to remote 3
It's the Gulf of Sidra
The US commander
is Nathan Benchley
In 1981,
two Libyan jets
attacked two American F-14s
They got an SU-22
- flying over the Gulf of Sidra
- Today they got a MIG-21,
a better plane
- Qaddafi claimed that the gulf
is part of Libya's
territorial waters
Both Libyan jets were downed
by the American fighters
- He is Nathan Benchley
- The commander
of one of those planes
Nathan Benchley, joins us
Commander, it must
have been tougher
shooting down the MIG-21
You got an SU-22
What's it like at confrontation?
What is a dogfight like?
After this, we'll do a wrap-up
Ask him how he knows
when he has a hit
Do you know
you have a hit
from a screen
inside your cockpit
or can you see
your missiles strike?
That's good
The equipment is sophisticated
but you like to see it
to confirm it
but you like to see it
to confirm it
It's considered
an outlaw nation
but some who have
interviewed Qaddafi
find him,
to use an American phrase
very presidential
Nice, Jane
We'll go to Martin Klein
then to the carrier pilot
from the Sidra... What!
No! You missed him?
There's only
How can you talk to me
about parking problems?
No, not "you'll try"!
Do it, or I'll fry
your fat ass!
I had no idea
she was this good
Tom
Tom
Fill for a second
Tom?
Go
The latest message
seems to indicate
that the Libyan pilot
was acting on his own
without authority
from anyone else
In other words,
I think we're all OK
Who the hell cares
what you think?
The Libyan government
has disavowed
prior knowledge of the attack
I'm Tom Grunick
reporting from Washington
Good afternoon
Animation
Thanks, everybody
We are out
Nice job, Tom
Everybody on the floor,
thank you so much
Good job, buddy
Hey
Thanks
Man!
You're great
Never so proud
of one of my decisions
Thank you, Ernie
Jane, great work
Really You know?
There were
no major gaffes, anyway
Oh!
No major gaffes
Ha ha!
You were brilliant!
Josh, great stuff
Thank you
Congratulations, Jane
You guys were so good
You guys!
Thanks, Jane
Thanks, Ernie
You know, this was
important for Tom
There's that bonding thing
that happens
I'm watching Paul
address the troops
It's not
the conventions anymore
It's this kind of moment
Oh, hi
Wow!
Hey, Mr. Ice Man!
You were great
You, too
Great job
Good work, Tom
Thanks
What a baptism, Tom!
Congratulations
With all this help,
it's easier than local
Where's Jane?
She's back there
Can I help you?
We're here to play
the new news theme
You're an amazing woman!
What a feeling
having you inside my head!
Yeah It was
an unusual place to be
It's, like, indescribable!
You knew just when
to feed me the next line
You knew the second
before I needed it
There was a rhythm
we got into
It was like great sex!
Ha ha ha!
You have to celebrate with me
Everybody's going
to the bar down the street
I'm going over to Aaron's
Maybe I'll hook up
with all of you later
How long do you think
you'll be there?
It starts off
with this very high-tech thing
like this
Bom bom
That's the news
Bom bom bom
The strings take the melody
Bah dah dah dah dah
dah dah
A-bom bom
bom bom
Dah dah dah
Dah dah dah bah
Al does the countermelody
Dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah
- Big finish!
- Big finish!
Bah bah bah dah
I got chills
Wasn't Tom great?
Well, it worked
It worked
Really?
Ha ha!
It was good?
Your calling in
that information...
You are
the classiest guy I know!
Here Have a beer
Celebrate
God
it was so strange
watching him
What's next...
lip-synching?
OK, OK, OK
I've been doing some of
the most important thinking
of my life today
I wonder if I
should tell you now
Whatever you think
I figured out
why I'm so hung up
on getting a chance
at weekend anchor
If I do it well,
they'll pay me more
and they'll treat me better
You may be on to something
Which means I'm at their mercy
and who wants that?
I won't tell you where
this thought has led me
Why not?
In the middle of this
I started thinking
about the one thing
that makes me feel good
and makes immediate sense
and it's you
Oh, bubba
I'm going to stop right now
Except I wish
you were two people
I'd tell the one
who's my friend
about the one
that I like so much
All right
I'm... I'm...
I'm not going to say any more
primarily because
I'm about to pass out
I'll walk you
to the corner
You get some sleep
Right now?
After I walk you
to the corner
Come on, buddy
You were stunning today
You have someplace
to go now, right?
Yeah, yeah
Good night
Good night
Well, I felt something
Hee hee hee!
Hey, we're going to Cap's Bar
on 17th and Vermont
Connecticut's clear on Sunday,
so take that over to 15th
and then straight down Vermont
and we should bypass
Thomas Circle that way
If you don't go over 40,
we'll catch mostly green lights
We tried...
I didn't think
you'd make it
I thought I'd see if all of you
were still here
I'll go join the gang
The gang is gone
We were the last ones
Oh
Well, I'll, uh...
I'll go have a burger
You want another burger?
Yeah
Hey, I know how to have
a burger by myself
I feel like
a little solitude
I sure know that feeling
Hey, terrific work today
Right back to you
Thanks
Good night
Good night
Ha ha!
I feel great
You sure I shouldn't
get a taxi?
What for?
Oh, I don't know
Why?
You have the greatest car
and the greatest driver
in all of Washington
You look confused
I'm not
Ohh
Ohh
Ha ha!
Oh
Give me some of that
Where's the bathroom?
Oh, through the closet
Wow!
I'm so tired
of defending my closet
I always had
a problem with space
It was getting so I
couldn't find anything
so I converted
a bedroom
Wait till you've been
doing it for 16 years
It's a great solution
Not only the storage
but you can see
everything you have
Do you do bunny rabbits?
Jennifer!
Isn't this a great date?
Good morning
Good morning
Yeah, we are
God help me
Well, they've been looking
at just about everything...
foreign bureaus,
domestic bureaus,
all kinds of personnel,
even equipment
Anyway, they seem
to be very, very serious
about making me cut
Now, this is going to mean
massive firings
Uh l'm doing
whatever I can
but I did want you
to be aware
of this very serious situation
Now, we're going to
also be covering
the Alaskan
serial killer trial
on a continuing basis
I'd like it to be
assigned out of Washington
We have to put someone
on a plane to Anchorage
Jane?
Who do you think
George Weln
or Jennifer?
Jennifer
Jennifer
Um Jennifer
Hire the Hoover group
tomorrow
Good night, Emily
Good night, Jane
Come on
I'll buy you a drink
There's a big thing
at the Italian embassy
I'm not sure
I'd be good company
tonight
Ahh, I'll be
the judge of that
I'll get my coat
Two, please
Tom?
Tom?
Ha ha ha!
I'm all right
Heavy hitters
Yeah
How are you doing?
Great
Network news,
Washington
I love it
What do you do when your real life
exceeds your dreams?
Keep it to yourself
You know, yesterday, I really
wanted to know your reaction
to how we did
with the Libyan report
I was going to ask
but I think I'm
I'm a little intimidated
with you
Stop it! You can't talk
about feeling intimidated
when you're
on top of the world
I'm not buying into that
I have a load to learn...
You have your job
Shut up
OK
Pretty peppy party,
isn't it, pal?
I made one rule for myself
when this started
and I realized I would take
a lot from you people
because of being
from sports
And that rule was?
Never to pretend to know
more than I did
Can you name all the members
of the Cabinet?
OK, let's drop it
I'm not taking
a test for you
If that came up
in conversation...
We're conversing
The names of the Cabinet
have slipped my mind
Say, do you know them?
OK, don't name them
Just tell me if you know
Yes, Aaron, I know them
OK
All 12?
Yes!
There's only 10
You're feeling good,
aren't you?
I'm starting to, yeah
Hey, we may do
state capitals next
Hi There you are
Is this it?
Yes
I am so exhausted
punchy
sick tired
I can't think,
and I can't move
I'm just a dead lump
of poured-out flesh
Would you like to come up?
Maybe we could just sit here,
talk a little
OK
I'll have to do
a whole story on my own
Eventually
I have an idea
for something
What?
If I tell you
can you manage
not to put it down
or tell me why it won't work
or is in bad
journalistic taste?
Yes, Tom,
I think I can manage
OK
It's about women
who are attacked
by someone they know
on a date
Ugh
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I didn't mean it
Well, keep it that way
Wait a minute!
I didn't say anything!
Stand
I'm innocent before I'm...
Ooh!
Innocent
You're guilty before
you can be innocent
Door to door
Hello?
Jane?
Jane
Yes
Tom?
Tom, is that you?
Yes
Hey, you called me
Is it your story?
No, um
Are you going to
the correspondents' dinner?
You need me for the story?
No Are you going?
Uh-huh
Maybe I get off work
I'd like to go
Good
We could go together
So
So, you like me, huh?
I like you as much
as I can like anyone
who thinks I'm an asshole
"Street cops say"
that fits
Was that last cut
good for you, Bobby?
Uh, yeah
Great
Thank you for asking
Thank you
According to the FBI
there were more than 87,000 rapes
reported last year
Most people think of a rapist
as a violent stranger
but today, an attack may be
what's called date rape...
being forced to have sex
with someone you know
You want to find
a nice guy
So anyway, it was that,
you know
"give him a chance"thing
Hi
- Shh!
- Shh!
- Shh!
I was lonely
So
we went to a movie
and when he
brought me home
he asked for a beer
and said he'd go
So how do you
say no to that?
My cousin Donna
Really?
So first, um
it was kind of like
this wrestling match
which was awful enough
because
it got very violent
What is this?
And I'm a modest person
And he ripped my clothes off
And he forced me to
make love
And then he stayed
in my apartment
and forced me more times
Oh
I'm sorry
I promised myself
I wasn't going to cry
Um it's just
this whole thing
has just messed me up
Let's turn on the news
Come on!
Sex, tears,
this must be the news
Sorry
I'm in a pissy mood
What's wrong with it?
Nothing
You blew the lid off nooky
- Oh!
- Oh!
The victims often remain
too terrified to talk
the police powerless
to perform properly
and all the welfare groups
can do is monitor this epidemic
of crime without punishment
Tom Grunick,
Annandale, Virginia
Malcolm West
on trial for the murders
of 15 men
has led police to four
Nice work
I got to get a crew
off the clock
What did you think?
It moved me
I did relate to it
I really did
It was unusual for you
to cut to yourself
when you teared up
And that might not
have been my choice
but it was real,
and it got me
and I think
a lot of the time
I'm too conservative
about that stuff
OK?
OK
body count's now 19
The jury returns to the site
Tom, that was
really swell tonight
Good
Four more bodies
now taken
from the frozen earth
Jennifer Mack
Wodahamlet, Alaska
Eastern's got
the right time
How are you?
Hi I'm just
writing you a note
Uh, what do you say
we take a walk?
Outside?
Yeah
Come on
I'm not suggesting
the worst will happen
It's just that somebody
with your brilliance
gets nibbles
about other jobs
now and again
Maybe down the road,
you should look into it
Oh, damn
Those fucking jerks
they want to fire me
All I know
is they got to fire
a large number of people
Ahh
They're not even
going by seniority
There's a recklessness
in the air
Do one thing for me
Get me one shot at anchoring
the weekend news
It could turn it around
for me
I could do that
this Saturday
Everybody wants off
for the correspondents' dinner
Do it, then
Please,
prepare carefully
This couldn't happen
at a better time
Prepare what?
You have Saturday's news handy?
It's a long while
since you've read the news
I'll have somebody
work with you
just on superficial
performance things
OK
I think I better
be alone for a while
I understand
I'll go with you
Thanks
This is very uncomfortable
for me
because, and I don't
mean this as a knock
but we approach
these things so differently
We sure do
and I don't mean that
as a knock, either
OK, go ahead
I'll just tell you
what I think
You can disregard it
if you want
I don't know how effective
this will be
because of
our different approaches
OK
Reports tonight...
Wait Your coat jacket
is rising up in back
OK
When you sit,
sit on your jacket
That will give you
a good line
Reports tonight...
Look at the monitor
OK
Reports tonight
from far down
on the Arabian peninsula
indicate that heavy fighting...
Your jacket, Aaron
What are you doing?
Don't touch me
Sit on it
But just don't handle me
I'm sitting on it!
Look
Fantastic tip!
That's great
Continues for a second day
between government
and rebel forces in pro-Soviet...
No
Don't let your eyes move
from the beginning to end
You don't want to
look shifty, do you?
No
The right side of your face
is the good one
They'll let me
do the news like this?
Heavy fighting
continues for...
Try to punch
one word or phrase
in every sentence
One idea per story
Punch
You were smoking there
toward the end
The pointers were great
I'll study the tape
Remember you're not
just reading the news
you're narrating it
You're selling them
this idea of you
You're saying,
"Trust me I'm credible"
So when you
feel yourself just reading
stop!
And start selling a little
OK So long
You look like
this porcelain thing
You look beautiful
You look beautiful
That's gorgeous!
What's that?
I spilled rum
on my jacket
Help me pick
something out
OK
I'm thinking the gray suit
Tom, why don't
I meet you there?
I got some stuff
to take care of
Did you rent the tux
or buy it?
I knew it
How much?
Wow!
OK, I'll see you there
You're going with him?
Don't wear that shirt
No, blue
Let me look at the gray
Not bad, right?
Looks nice
So help me pick a tie
OK You brought
all of them
How much was the tux?
No
Yeah Try this one
Not bad
I read about it
in a magazine
That way you don't
put on too much
Could you at least pretend
it's awkward
me showing up
while you're getting ready
for this date?
It's not a date!
It's coworkers going
to a professional conclave
I hate missing it
I wish I could be there
Me, too
If it gets dull
before 11:00
you'll drop by the studio
I'm not sure I can
I'll have the tape
I'll wait for you afterwards
at my house
OK, great
Good luck
Thanks
Have a good time tonight
You, too
The Marriott
What is it?
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
Oh, no
My little tailor!
You were all wrinkled
and schmutzy
I've got shoulders
Good?
Thanks
Maybe I'll just stand here
and guard your corner
I'll be here when you get back
Don't take Connecticut Go
Taxi!
I want you to go
All right
I'm going to go get
a cellular
Hey, Nick
Read this over
See what you think
Sure
Aaron
Hey, George
What are you doing here?
Anchoring the weekend news
I'm going to anchor it
Hey!
Way to go
This is terrific
This is a pleasure
to read, really
Is there water on the set?
Yeah, sure
You'll be fine
Yes, I know what you mean
The LA Times
is a great outfit
best severance pay
in the business
He was lecturing me
I said, "I refuse
to look at it as a negative
I'm young My news
appeals to people my age"
He just hired
a 26-year-old producer
No kidding? 26?
Well, hello, Tom
He moves and smiles
and moves and smiles
If he doesn't
see me soon
we're not supposed to
be together
It's for me?
Hi, Jane
Hey, Arlene
It's incredible who's here!
Who?
Me
That's an outlaw dress
Thank you
Yes!
Whoo!
OK, 20 seconds to air
Cue graphic
The Weekend Report
with Aaron Altman
Go, Aaron
Good evening
In mood and language better suited
to an espionage novel
than the delicate world
of the Western alliance
the British foreign secretary
today pounced
on what he termed
the nest of professional spies
and amateur traitors
who are turning
NATO headquarters
into an instrument whose
only true function is folly
We begin our coverage
with Edward Towne in London
Take it
The British
She's coming in now
for denouncing
breaches of security
Any breach of security
Gee whiz!
I think I'm starting
to perspire a little
involving NATO military
deployment was passed on
Are you seeing this?
The information
was apparently delivered
in coded messages
written on paper bags
from the NATO cafeteria
Six cafeteria workers
Five seconds!
Edward Towne, London
The sub bases referred to
are located in five countries...
Norway, Belgium,
the Netherlands
Spain, and Great Britain
This is more
than Nixon ever sweated
Our own state department
was rocked
not only by the revelation
but from the highly unusual
persistence
of the state press corps
Nice touch
Martin Klein reports
on the ruckus
at Foggy Bottom
Just how noticeable is this?
Huh?
Do you have a bigger one?
Hurry!
will severely limit
NATO's ability
Five seconds!
Everything's fine, Aaron
A bomb exploded
on a railroad bridge
outside of Madras, India,
sending a passenger train
You've got
your hands in
You've got your hands in!
Your hand!
Get your hand out!
Your hand!
You know, he wrote
some beautiful stuff
were reported injured
at least 22 people dead
Commercial
I wish I were one of them
Remember Brinkley's great line?
"It's as irrevocable
as a haircut"
Can I check your purse?
I got some decent stuff
at yard sales
I like those
Can I have your autograph
for my wife?
How are you doing, Paul?
Tom
You're finally learning
to be flexible
Glad you've changed
your mind about Tom
Ma'am, can I check
your purse?
I'd like to know
what the contents are myself
Sir, may I see
that briefcase?
I'd like to check
the contents
Could I see your purse?
We got to go
I'm sorry
What?
Ioh!
You OK?
Great
I'm so sorry I pulled you away
from that dinner
Those things can be
a lot of fun
Everybody tries to be funny
All of a sudden,
there's these people
trying to make
political careers
out of how many laughs
they get
Why can't I let go
of this woman?
Well
At least kiss me
when you do that
You just can't stop
editing me, huh?
This is hysterical
I was half hoping
I wouldn't have
a good time tonight
Know why?
Because you're nuts?
Right Isn't she
fun to tease?
Ohh
What?
More and more lately
when I've been
watching you in action
and seeing you
and all your
energy
I've been wondering
what it'd be like
to be inside
all that energy
Me, too
I don't remember ever saying
anything like that exactly
I don't know
why I just did
Wait a minute
I can think
of two reasons
I just thought of another
If you talk about it,
you don't have to do it
That's not it
You're trying to make it
all about sex
or it's that great feeling
that you don't want
to hold anything back
You know, intimacy
Oh, shit
What?
I promised Aaron
I'd stop by and see how he did
I'll go along
No! I'll be back at your place
as soon as I can
Jane!
What happened?
Don't run off
like everything's settled
the minute
you make up your mind
He can talk more freely
if I go alone
It's just that
I'd like you
to give me a minute
so I can catch up
OK
Sorry
Don't yell at me
like that again
You scared the life out of me
It's open!
I was in the shower
How'd it go?
You didn't talk to anybody?
No
Then it went very well
Really?
Define your terms
Do you feel good about it?
No
Do others feel you did well?
No
What was good?
I lost 6 pounds
Aaron, will you tell me?
It was great!
There I was,
writing my first-rate copy
sitting on my jacket,
punching my one thought
Except I had this historic attack
of flop sweat
I'll never anchor again, ever
I lost one
of your shoulder pads
I think it drowned
What do you mean,
flop sweat?
I bet you were
the only one who knew
People phoned in
Stop kidding!
I'm not!
There were complaining calls
because you were sweating?
Nice ones worried
I was having a heart attack
If all that happened
how come you're so chipper?
I don't know
I don't know
At some point, it was so bad,
it just got funny
My central nervous system
was telling me something
Sweat pouring down my face
makeup falling
into my eyes
people turning on
this fusillade
of blow dryers...
all so I could
read introductions
to other people
covering the stories
which is what
I like to do anyway
And I'm chipper
because you finally showed up
I'm going to cook for us
Tequila and eggs sound good?
I have to be someplace
Now?
I told what's his name... Tom...
that I'd meet him
Call him up
It can wait,
right?
I don't know
I
I may be in love with him
I knew it
Get out of my house now
Get out
I'm not kidding!
Get out of here!
You go to hell!
Come back here
Come on
Don't go
This is important to me!
I think it's important
for you, too
Come on Sit down
Sit down
What is this?
I'll take it
What?
Give me one minute, please!
This is tough
Ah!
Jane
OK, let's take the part
that has nothing to do with me
Let me just be
your most trusted friend now
the one that gets to say
all the awful stuff, OK?
I guess
Yes
You can't end up with Tom
because it totally goes against
everything that you're about
Yeah
being a basket case
I know you care about him
I've never seen you
like this with anybody
so don't get me wrong
when I tell you that Tom
while being
a very nice guy
is the devil
This isn't friendship
You're crazy,
you know that?
What do you think
the devil would look like?
A guy with a pointy tail?
What will he sound like?
"Aah! Aah!"
No
I'm semi-serious here
You're serious...
He will be attractive,
nice and helpful
He'll work where he influences
a great God-fearing nation
He'll never do an evil thing
or hurt a living thing
He'll just bit by little bit
lower our standards
where they're important
Just coax along,
flash over substance
just a tiny little bit
And he'll talk about all of us
really being salesmen
And he'll get
all the great women
Hey, Aaron!
I think you're the devil!
You know I'm not!
How?
Because I think we have
the kind of friendship
where if I were the devil
you'd be the only one
I'd tell!
You ran after Tom's help...
Yes!
If things had
gone well tonight
I probably wouldn't say this
I grant you everything,
but give me this
He personifies everything
that you've been fighting against
And I'm in love with you
How do you like that?
I buried the lead
I've got to not
say that out loud
It takes too much out of me
I never fought
for anyone before
Does anybody win
one of these things?
Hello
Hi
Hi Where are you?
L... I can't get away just yet
I'm at Aaron's
Oh, well, when?
I'm not sure
It seems like he had
a mishap on the news
I know
I taped it
It wasn't as bad
as he thinks, was it?
It wasn't unprecedented
or anything
Not if you count
Singing In The Rain
Don't treat it
like a tragedy
Want me to talk to him?
Uh-uh
He says you could
hardly notice it
Um
Um
Let me talk to him
Don't say anything
about anything
Let me talk to him
Hi
Hi
Sorry to keep Jane
I didn't realize
you'd be going this late
I'll put her back on
Thank you
Hi again
I'm sorry about this
Look
Don't worry
That sounds more important
Let's...
Let's forget
about tonight
I don't know
if that's absolutely necessary
I have my father
coming through tomorrow
I should get some sleep
Uh-huh
I'll see you at the office
Good night
Hello?
Yes?
OK
Good night
Good night?
Jane
I am not some chore
you have to finish
so you can
stay on schedule
OK, Grunick
Easy shots now
Good night
He just canceled
He had a
chance to think
and he canceled
I can't...
I can't breathe
Damn it!
Over a guy!
Well, Jane,
thanks for stopping by
Good night
He's on assignment right now
Hi
I kept trying to call you
You never called me!
Were you just diddling me?
When I'm a woman
I get fucked around by you?
Jane, this is my dad
I'm very pleased
to meet you, sir
Please forgive what I said
Sorry
Just light up a room
and leave, huh?
You want my opinion?
What's easy to miss
about Jane...
You want my opinion?
Yes, I would
The way she just acted
is not the way
an affectionate person acts
Yes, it would be my pleasure
Rorish
When do you start
telling people?
Almost immediately, Bill
I'd like to take
everybody out after the show
Fantastic
Hello, Donny
Bill, what a surprise
Hi, Mr. Rorish
Bill, this is hard on all of us
It's no time for compliments
but I think
it's extraordinary of you
to come down here for this
If we're not here
during the tough times
we're not a news organization
Bill!
Welcome back to Washington
Bill
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
I forget
Is she on the list?
This is a brutal layoff
And all because they couldn't
program Wednesday nights
You can make it less brutal
by knocking a million or so
off your salary
A bad joke
I'm sorry
Awful It's a miserable day
That was just some kind
of sick joke defense mechanism
It just doesn't indicate
any of my feelings
not one
It just shows
the kind of stress
this represents for all of us
No excuse for it, though
Bill
Tom
It's about time
Good to see you
I feel terrible
about what happened
What did he say?
He said, um
that he liked you
Because you looked like
you had fire and honesty
No
Did he really?
Yes
What?
Come here
Come here
Uh
Paul canned me
Well, my brother
will feel great
Now he's not
the only screw-up
Tom, Paul wants to see you
Bob, I just found out
Sons of bitches!
Ernie, they're calling from work
Tell them I'm on my way in
It's Paul
He'll just be a minute
I hate this so much
You know, I'm just old enough
to be flattered by the term
"early retirement"
That's wonderful
What a lovely line
Now, if there's anything
I can do for you...
I certainly hope
you'll die soon
Tom
This is
a severe cutback, Tom
in this bureau alone
including technical personnel
We're going to reorganize
at the same time
We're dropping you from Washington
and assigning you to London
You knew they were
going to offer me this
before I went in there
I can't stand this!
We care for each other
too much
to be dishonest
I'm leaving
No matter who they
replace me with
they were making me
leave anyway
The fact that it's you
takes some of the sting
out of it
And I don't think
you're any better than I am
Goddamn!
No, I'm not!
Are you out of your mind?
Have you guys seen Jane?
She's back there
getting my job
The first woman bureau chief
we've ever had here
What happened to you?
They booted me
out of Washington
Impossible!
There isn't a system
in the world
that wouldn't value
one of us
What did they do to you?
It's what he did
I'm proud of him
They told me
they'd keep me
because they could plug me
into any story
and my salary was in line
so I quit
Jane, I got
to tell you something
Yeah?
Except for socially
you're my role model
Hope I can get him back
You packing up tonight?
Mm-hmm I'm sorry
they're sending you down
I'm sure you'll make it back
Where are they sending you?
London
London?
Yeah
That's a promotion
I don't think so
Yes! That's where
they sent Rorish
before they made him anchor
I can't believe you!
They're grooming you
for it all!
You don't even know it!
Keep it down, will you?
Let me ask you something
You had one camera crew
on that daybreak piece?
Yeah
Sticking around
for the farewell party?
No, it won't be much fun
watching Martin Klein
and Ernie
turn in their credentials
to the security guard
Hi, Hank
Can I speak with my wife?
No message
I'll see her at home
This is one story
they're not going to cover
If the network
doesn't cover it
it's not important,
so why worry?
I'm going to miss you
You're a prick
in a great way
Ha ha ha!
You know what I mean
I like the way
it made me sound
OK Be good
We'll figure out
who's hiring, OK?
Nobody knows
what they'll do now
It's not fair, Donny
Thank you, Jane
Good luck
Oh, sorry
You know, what I always wanted
to tell you is that
Jane, Martin would like
to see you
if you get a chance
This is the third cutback
in four years
These people
It's all so awful
It just hurts
physically, doesn't it?
Like something's wrong
with your bones
Like your
organs are shifting
inside your body
Maybe I haven't
been here long enough
Hey, congratulations
on the promotion
Congratulations?
How can you say that
to me?
I'm sorry
I can't stand here feeling bad
because I don't feel worse
This has happened at every station
I've ever been to
Do they owe you
any time off?
I think it's crazy for you
to come here tomorrow
and start a new job
I have a week
before I have to get
to my new job
Let's get the hell away
to some island fast and
and find out how we are together
away from this
Well
I just think
that's an extraordinary
proposal
That's yes?
That's more than yes
That's "you bet"
Hello
Bastard! Sneak! Quitter!
Speaking
I just found out
You didn't
say anything to me
Will you meet me?
No, I can't
Maybe next week
No I'm going away tomorrow
I'll meet you at the place
near the thing
OK
Anyway, my agent says
he has a very hot prospect...
the number two station
in Portland
They want to be
as good as the networks
Personally, I think
he should aim higher
Tell me the god's
honest truth
Are you leaving
because of me?
Ernie said
you're lucky
if you get out
while you can still cry
I should have quit
three years ago
You're just trying
to say great stuff
so I'll feel even worse
that you're not around
Let's go
I just want
to s-sit here
I mean, the feeling
to stay here
is powerful
Why is that?
Maybe the best part
of your life is over
and you don't want
to start the bad part
You are now required
to sit here with me!
Come on!
Be smart for a second
What do you
think will happen to us?
What will happen?
That's very easy
Five, six years from now
I'll be back
to collect an award
representing the surge
in foreign coverage
by local stations
What will they
call the award?
The Euchy
Yes
Anyway, I'll be walking
with my wife and children
We'll bump into you
My son will say something
and I will say,
"It's not nice
to make fun
of single fat ladies"
You won't be able to stay
mad at me, right?
I hope so
No, I'm not really mad
I'll miss you,
we'll talk
we'll always be friends
we'll get hot
for each other
and we'll never
act on it OK?
I got to go
Jane?
You know how Tom
had tears in his eyes
in that interview
with that girl?
Ask yourself how we
were able to see that
when he only had
one camera
and it was pointed
at the girl
during the entire interview
I'm fairly sure
I was right to tell you
It was just
this whole thing
has just messed me up
maybe more than
it should have
I'm sorry
Are you OK?
Yes, I'm sorry
Don't be silly
What are you sorry about?
I just went
Oh, we just need a...
We just need a minute
more of your time
So he can shoot
from behind you
toward me, and, uh
we'll have some place to go
when we cut
I sit here,
I nod my head
and I look nerdy
Tom, that kills me
we didn't get you on camera
So powerful...
seeing your reaction
I thought you were
going to cry yourself
That would have
been something
Give me a minute
Fuckin'...
Oh, it's amazing
Pardon me, please
Where would we catch a bus
to Washington?
Turn right
Thank you very much
See? I told you
Look who's
the organized one
I got everything!
I'm not going
Why?
I saw the taped outtakes
of the interview
with the girl
I know you...
acted your reaction
after the interview
It's verboten, huh?
I thought since I almost
did it the first time, but
but I get you
That's not the reason
you're not coming
Of course it's the reason
It's terrible
Come with me
We'll disagree
and get a tan
at the same time
If you're going to be glib
I'm going to lose it!
Jane, keep it down
I was up all night, and
Jane
it made me ill
That's better
You could get fired
for that
I got promoted for that
Working up tears
for a news piece cutaway?
You crossed the line...
It's hard not to
They keep moving
the little sucker!
It...
It proves that
the differences we...
This is a one-way argument
We have six days
If we fight,
we'll come home
If you don't go
I leave for London
after that
So it would be
a very big deal...
The plane is boarding
You're good at deadlines
Here's your ticket
It's amazing
You commit this
breach of ethics
then you act as if...
I'm giving you a hard time
about nothing!
Try and get this!
When you edited
that piece...
I'm leaving now
Gate E-2
Good morning!
Good morning
DuPont Circle, please
Don't take the beltway
because at this time of day
there's going to be a...
Go any way you want
But New York Avenue's faster
When they told me
Bill had decided to retire
and offered me
the evening news
I thought it was
the same kind of joke
we used to pull
at the station...
turning someone's prompter off
in the middle of a show
But when they heard
my reaction
they thought I was kidding
I told them
I'd be their anchor
but I didn't want to be
the managing editor
that there were people
better qualified
than I
to control the content
and if there weren't,
we were all in trouble
Now to something
more important
I'd like to introduce
my fiancée
Lila?
Oh, Aaron!
Congratulations
Lila, Lila
Lila, this is Aaron Altman
Hi
This kid
couldn't possibly belong
to anyone else!
What's your name?
Clifford
Do you know
who this is?
The big joke?
Ha ha
Ooh I don't know
You know, Jane’s down here
I'm taking Cliff to see her
Can I come along?
Yeah
I'll meet you back
at the place? OK?
Yes
We'll call Mommy later
Your speech was magnificent
Oh, I forgot to say something
about the speech
I appreciate that
Tom, we are proud of you
Thanks
Hey, guys!
Come over here!
Hey
Hey, what is this?
My life is rushing
in front of my eyes!
Clifford, come over here!
I want to show you something!
Clifford, come on!
I want to show you something
Picnic?
I thought
for old Cliff here
but who knew about this?
It'll be great, though
Did you get in last night?
Yeah Extreme culture shock
You are more adorable
than your pictures
Look at you!
Look what I got
for you, Cliff
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
That's terrific!
Let me see it, Cliff
Come here
Are you any closer
to a decision?
I think so
Aaron, they've
been talking to me
about being managing editor
Really?
Whoo!
I'm going to take it
Oh, that is...
Jane, what a job!
A great surprise!
I didn't think
we had a chance
They told me you wanted
to stay in Washington
Well, there's a guy
but he says
he'll fly up a lot
Well, we should talk
Do you have time for dinner?
I'd like you to meet Lila
I was really
looking forward to that
I'm going to go back
in a few hours
It's so good to see you
It's nice to see you
Congratulations,
on the history's
longest winning streak
If you ever get restless
in Portland
let me know
Why?
OK
Bye
boss
Hey, Cliff!
Where are you going?
Cliff!
Go back to your father
Come on, Cliff!
Come on
Daddy
So who's the guy?
Uh, well, we met about...
three months ago
He works at
the surgeon general's office
He loves boating
So, he's been getting me
into waterskiing
Ha ha ha!
I like it!
So what about you lately?
Well
my wife got
this new job
Great
It starts off
with this
very high-tech thing
like this
Bom bom
That's the news
Bom bom bom
The strings take the melody
Bah dah dah dah dah
dah dah
A-bom bom bom bom
Dah dah dah
Dah dah dah bah
Al does the countermelody
Dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah
- Big finish!
- Big finish!
Bah bah bah dah!
