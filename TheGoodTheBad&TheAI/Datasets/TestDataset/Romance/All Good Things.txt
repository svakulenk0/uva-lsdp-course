Man:
For the record,
Tell the ladies
and gentlemen
of the jury
Man #2:
Um, david marks.
And where
were you born?
Is your father
still alive?
Is your mother
still alive?
How old were you
when your mother died?
Were you present
when she died?
She died
a violent death.
David,
if you don't mind,
I'm going to ask
you some more
about your past.
I'm sorry?
Yes, I'd like to make
a collect call, please.
David marks.
Dad, david.
Huh?
How am I gonna do that?
I got on the tuxedo.
Can't we just
call a plumber?
Yeah right,
why would we do that?
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would you send a plumber
to do a plumber's job, huh?
-
-
What are you
looking at, huh?
Hi.
Oh. Hi.
Um...
I've forgotten
why I'm here.
I was gonna make
some coffee.
- Excuse me?
- Do you want coffee?
I was gonna make some.
No thank you.
Am I keeping you
from something?
Yeah.
But it's something
I'm dreading.
Hey, do you have
some kind of--
- I don't know, something
I could put under here?
- Uh, yeah.
Here.
So how long ago
did you move in?
- On Sunday.
- Oh.
- From where?
- Long island.
- Oh.
- My mom's house.
- Are you done?
- I think I should stop.
You know?
I mean--
I'm not a plumber.
I mean, as you
might have guessed.
And I can't get a plumber
in here until Monday.
So, uh...
I guess what I've done
Is, uh...
Do you want help
with that?
Yeah.
Uh, anyway, so I guess
what I did was
Come out here to tell you
that you have a leak
And, uh,
That you should get it fixed.
You smell good.
You're gonna be late.
So?
I'm always late.
You could always
blame me.
Hi, david marks.
Sir, right this way.
- Oh god.
- Oh look, there.
- Here, take this.
- Go easy on him.
Okay, I don't
have to tell you--
just ignore him
And I apologize
for anythinge says
Between now
and the time we leave.
Late.
Always late.
Anybody who didn't
know you would think
you were a busy man.
Oh, I see you brought
a friend.
- Katie.
- Katie.
Your full name, dear,
always.
Oh, katherine mccarthy.
Well, what a lovely
young woman you are.
You've even managed to make
my vagabond son look handsome.
He is handsome.
David, I need you
to meet the next senator
from new york.
And I didn't
invite you here
to help you get laid.
- Ambassador moynihan.
- Sanford, congratulations.
- Thank you.
Welcome back.
- Thank you.
Liz.
Always more gracious.
Ambassador, you remember
my eldest son david?
David the heir apparent.
Of course, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.
- Oh, and this is...
- Katherine mccarthy.
- Miss mccarthy.
- My wife elizabeth.
- Ambassador.
- Ah, the man himself.
Thank you.
- Here you go, dad.
- Thanks, daniel.
- Hey, shouldn't you be
wearing white gloves?
Screw you, david.
- Is that irish?
- Excuse me?
Moynihan, is that
an irish name?
Gaelic. Originally
scottish-gaelic.
- But my family...
-
My friends,
a man who's old enough
To remember
how 42nd street
Used to be--
sanford marks!
My father had a vision
for times square
And he passed it on to me.
Where there are peep shows
and massage parlors,
I see broadway theaters
restored to their former glory.
And where there are
dilapidated hotels,
I see gleaming
office towers
Bustling with the important
business of this city.
It's my hope I can help
breathe life
Back into this neighborhood
that was so dear to my father,
A man who placed great trust
in me to carry on his legacy.
To howard marks.
Lawyer:
David, tell me about
the family business.
Has the marks
organization
always been
A powerful entity
in new york?
David:
We were always
in the top five or six
Property owners
in manhattan.
Was it work that you
were interested in?
- A health food store?
- Silly, right?
No, I--
I think that's great.
- Really?
- Yeah. Where?
I was thinking
in vermont maybe.
What do you do?
I want to go
to medical school,
But since my dad died...
It's funny how hard it is
just to do what
you want, huh?
- Yeah.
- I bet you could
do anything.
¶ Oklahoma, where the wind
comes sweeping down the plains ¶
¶ when the wind comes--
right behind the plains! ¶
¶ hey, ayipioeeay! ¶
¶ We're only singing ¶
¶ you're doing fine,
oklahoma... ¶
Lawyer:
Did your father approve
Of you living with
katherine mccarthy?
David:
Well, he didn't really have
a problem with that,
But he wanted me
to live in new york and to
go into the family business.
Thank you.
What did you do
instead?
Katie and I moved
to vermont.
We lived this sort
of a back-to-the-land
kind of lifestyle.
Bought a small
piece of land and we
ran a health food store.
It's perfect.
She's certainly a very
enthusiastic young woman.
- Where did you find her?
- 53rd street.
She had a leaky faucet.
Ah yes, the famous
leaky faucet
of 53rd street.
Aren't you
sorry you gave up
a promising career
- In real estate?
- No.
You're ignoring
a very hard fact
of life, david.
What's that?
- She's never gonna
be one of us.
- No, I know.
Isn't that great?
Don't forget
your racquet.
...A million miles away.
It's just like picking off
another part of your forehead.
I'll burn you.
Just you.
The rest of you,
you're fine,
but that part,
- Forget it.
- David?
You're talking to yourself.
Woman:
David, I hope you
brought an appetite!
The ham looks delicious, mom.
...You squeeze one time
and you get ketchup and mustard,
- I call it kepustard.
-
- We put the...
- Katie, your brother's
going to be a millionaire.
- Woman: Pass that ham down.
- David,
What does your family
usually do for the holidays?
We're going-- ahem.
We're going skiing.
Oh, skiing!
I'm gonna teach david
how to ski.
I'd be scared too.
- You look terrific.
- Thank you.
- Doesn't she look terrific?
- Man: She's a beautiful girl.
The marks family.
Marks.
Are you kidding?
They own half
of times square.
Can we please
not talk about
this now?
Which half of times square?
What are you talking about?
- I'm just saying.
- He's taking her to paris.
- That's what she said.
- Hey!
Whatever happened
to my trip to paris?
You'd be
lucky to get a trip
to paris, new jersey.
Katie:
Mom's making coffee.
- What?
- Why are you hiding?
I'm not.
Is it awful?
Awful?
Is it awful?
No, it's not awful
at all.
It's just different,
that's all.
It's just
very different.
You know, everybody
talks to each other
And there's a ham
with pineapples on it
With little cherries
in the middle.
- Cherries,
I like those cherries.
- Yeah, I like them too.
It's just really different.
Will you marry me?
What?
Was that a yes?
- Thank you.
- This was nice.
Yeah.
We just wanted to do it,
to make it official.
It's $39.50 each.
That includes
a generous tip.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Thanks, mom.
- You're welcome, sweetheart.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Sanford:
So the guy's not selling
And his kids are starving.
And he's sitting on the world's
Most valuable butcher shop.
But my dad wouldn't give up.
He used to say
"there's always a way
to convince a holdout."
You know?
I came around.
Sooner or later
everybody does.
-
- oh, david.
- Look who's here.
- Oh, speak of the devil.
Your grandfather
didn't come hat in hand
To ask me
to join the firm.
It was understood.
I understood it.
Your brother
understands it
and you do too.
We're happy here, okay?
- I'm subsidizing that.
- Yeah, only until
we get settled.
Settled?
You think she's happy here?
- Isn't she?
- You think she had
this dump in mind
When she left mineola?
When she laid eyes on you?
No, she had more in mind
And she deserves better.
She's a beautiful woman.
Just like your mother.
- Thanks for visiting.
- Thank you, honey.
I'd better get back to work.
How do you think my son can
afford to live like this?
What?
Sanford:
Take me to the airport.
Best of luck.
Do you have a place
picked out in new york yet?
Lawyer:
Then why did you
sell it?
David:
I guess I thought it was
what I should do.
And I went along
with my father's wishes
And I agreed to go
into the family business.
Some of our times square tenants
pay their rent in cash,
So you'll pick it up
in person.
- Solly, give him
the address of the luxor.
- Sure.
When you get down there,
you'll see why I'm sending you.
These people are not
really corporate.
But these properties need
to pay for themselves.
That is, until we
tear 'em down.
And ultimately
I think maybe you can
manage the whole area.
Well, it's good to have
you here, son.
You keep solly
in the loop, huh?
Lawyer:
Explain to
the jury, please,
What the family business
consisted of.
David:
My grandfather owned
land in midtown
Which was,
once upon a time, a farm.
We built apartments
and office buildings
And whatever
was appropriate
for the time.
Woman: Here!
Lawyer:
What did you do for
the marks organization?
Um, some leasing,
but mostly
Man:
I followed the kid
all night.
Massage parlors,
peep shows,
All people see are
the fancy office towers.
But marks owns some
of the worst buildings
in times square.
- He's the problem.
- What do you want from me?
We need to take
the offensive, mr. Mayor.
- Let me use the police.
- Relax, sidney.
We'll get what we want.
Remember,
We're just
the custodians.
-
- david: Ow.
- Katie: My eyes are closed.
- Close your eyes.
- My eyes are closed.
- I swear to god,
If I'm going to be
a captain of industry,
We might as well
enjoy the perks.
- You're looking.
- No I'm not.
Okay.
- Do you want to count it down?
- You do it.
- Five...
- Mm-hmm.
...Four, three,
Two,
One.
Oh.
Ohh.
oh my gosh.
You like it up there
or you want to come down?
- I want to come down.
- Come on down.
Hi.
It's gonna be
so beautiful here.
Do you ever think
about having kids?
Come on.
Don't you want
a little david
Running around the house?
Pulling at your toes
in the morning?
Smushing food
in your hair?
Are you saying no?
Can't we just talk more
about the apartment
And, you know,
Whether this is going
to be a dining room
or a living room?
Or... You know?
Are you saying "not now"
about kids
Or not ever?
Not ever.
David...
Is there something
wrong with you?
Yeah.
There is something
wrong with me.
Are you saying no?
David?
Yeah?
Are you okay?
Lawyer:
David, did you
ever have
Any kind
of psychiatric
treatment?
David:
Well, after my mother died,
I was sent to psychiatrists.
I didn't find them
very helpful.
Was there anyone
in your life
With whom you did
talk openly about
your past?
David, you cocksucker!
Get over here
and give me a hug.
¶ Get down,
boogie oogie oogie... ¶
- How are you?
- ¶ Get down ¶
- ¶ boogie oogie oogie... ¶
- look at her.
I swear to god,
I had no idea
That people like her
even existed.
She's perfect.
what do you mean by perfect?
I mean there's nothing that
I do that she doesn't like.
She hasn't known you
long enough.
It must be so exciting,
having your first book
published?
You know, I was thinking
of taking some classes.
- Maybe premed.
- How's, uh...
How's david doing
working for his dad?
Oh, he doesn't say
or he just says "okay."
Well, that's him.
It's like--
Like when he lost his mother.
- When did she pass away?
- Pass away?
She jumped off the roof,
Cracked her skull open like
a walnut on the driveway.
David saw the whole thing.
He hid under a table for a week.
When he came out, it was...
It was like he never had one.
One what?
A mother.
And... And that was it.
Excuse me, katie.
Woman: Smile.
She's very sweet.
- Unbelievable.
- What?
You're the only person
I know that can say "sweet"
like you're cursing.
I did--
sweet is a great thing.
- I wish I was sweet.
- Yeah, I wish you
were sweet too.
- Mm-hmm.
- What'd you say to her?
Nothing.
I didn't say
anything to her.
- We were just talking.
I just met her.
- Nothing? Mm-hmm.
Anyway.
I've missed you.
Quit it!
I'm being sweet.
I've missed you.
I've missed you too.
You surprised me a little.
You're married to
a nice blonde shiksa?
-
- well, I wouldn't put it
like that.
You're working for--
you're working for
your dad, david?
Which you said
you'd never do.
- When's the baby shower?
- Come on.
You know, it's still me.
Does that girl know
how fucked up you are?
No, we're gonna--
we're gonna straighten
you out, david.
We are.
I know a great therapist
And you're gonna
love her because...
Because she does house calls.
Try to focus
on your breathing.
It's not
so much the memory,
but the feeling--
The feeling
the memory evokes.
-
- okay okay?
- Again?
- Yeah.
-
- shit.
Jesus.
Lawyer:
How did you
and katie feel
About your new life
in the city?
David:
Well, new york commercial
real estate is very,
You know,
it's button-down
and white shoe,
And I really wasn't
set up for that.
But katie seemed
to like the city
And she'd fixed up
the apartment and...
And eventually
we even ended up
buying a weekend place
Am I--
am I overdressed?
You look beautiful.
Oh!
This place must have
cost a pretty penny.
Do you think
all of these people
drove up from the city?
¶ In the morning
you go gunning ¶
¶ for the man who stole
your water... ¶
Jim:
Hey, we're looking
for katie.
Oh, my brother's here.
Come on.
- Katie.
- Hi.
¶ And the mourners
are all silent... ¶
Oh my god, disco people.
Honey, babe--
- ¶ but the hangman
isn't hanging... ¶
-
You know, I really think
it's quite unique.
Of course I'd love
to pick your brain
- About the business plan.
- ¶ Go back, jack,
do it again... ¶
Get up.
Dance with me.
¶ Wheel turnin'
round and round ¶
Thank you
for inviting us.
It's nice to finally
meet the neighbors.
Can I touch your belly?
Sure.
It's moving.
She's moving.
- How do you know?
- I just do.
Barry tried on
every shirt he owns.
-
- we don't get out much.
Most of these people
are david's friends.
I don't even think
he knows half of them.
Oh, I thought
they were your friends.
- Some of them.
- I guess it's just the way
people act around you.
They sort of favor you.
Maybe because
I'm pregnant.
Are you?!
You're the first person
I've told.
That's wonderful!
How far along are you?
I just found out.
Um, I don't know
how it happened.
It wasn't planned.
- That's not what I said.
- You said that you couldn't,
- That it wasn't possible.
- That's not what I said.
- That there was
something wrong with you.
- I didn't say that.
- Yes you did.
- What's the difference?
All the difference
in the world.
Look, um,
We've got
an apartment in manhattan.
We got a house
in the country.
- We got a mercedes.
- I don't care about
all of that.
- You don't care...
- I care about you, david.
I want to have
your child. David!
Okay, if you don't care,
we'll just go back to vermont.
Fine, we'll go back
to vermont, fine.
We'll do whatever
you want to do.
Please, david.
it won't be like
when you grew up.
What do you know abo it?
I'm not blind.
David?
Look at me.
You make me out to be
this person
That you...
Think that I am.
But I'm not that person.
You can ask me
anything you want.
Anything anything.
anything and I'll do it.
Just don't ask me this.
I can't do this.
Are you ready?
Uh, I gotta make a stop.
On the way.
What are we doing here?
What is this place?
I gotta make a call.
I'm at the luxor
and there's cops everywhere.
Listen to me,
go over to the avon.
They may be next.
No, you gotta find
somebody else, okay?
I gotta take katie somewhere.
What the hell are you
talking about?
The mayor's
not available.
David, get your ass over
to the avon and pick up
the cash!
Jeez!
-
-
Uh...
You go ahead
And I'll be
right behind you, okay?
I'll be there.
Mr. Marks?
Mrs. Marks?
I'm sorry,
Hey, david, david.
Hey, if it isn't
the happy couple.
They can't seat us
for like an hour.
Do you mind, david?
Is that okay?
Uh, can we pull a chair
over here, please?
Is that okay?
Thank you.
- Thank you, thank you.
- My pleasure.
So I heard about
all the excitement today.
Your old man must have had
you running all over town.
Sit. I'll go.
I'll go, I'll go.
What is wrong with you?
I'm sorry.
That's just todd.
He is completely unaware
of anyone else around him.
Which just
Makes him an asshole.
Let's step
into my office.
Come on,
it'll cheer you up.
Have you done this before?
No.
You're just gonna
snort it back fast,
Like this.
Trust me, whatever's
on your mind now,
It won't be.
Do you want
something?
¶ beside me
to guide me ¶
¶ to hold me ¶
¶ 'cause when I'm bad,
I'm so so bad ¶
Radio:
...Tough comparisons
and increased piracy may help.
The inventory issue is
likely one time in nature.
However, piracy is an ongoing
problem for microsoft.
- The most damaging--
-
Lawyer:
In the next few years,
how did things change?
David:
We began sort of living
separate lives.
Katie lived at our lake house.
She was going to college
near there.
So it made sense,
I guess, and...
I was still working
in the city, so that
kept me busy.
Woman:
Did you even tell him
you applied to medical school?
- Katie: Not yet.
- You have to tell him.
I know, I--
It's because of school,
you know.
I'm here during the week
and we only see each other
on the weekends.
Yeah well, he's gonna
find out anyway, because
you're gonna get in.
David?
What are you doing?
It was drifting away.
I don't want anybody
to steal it.
Oh, david.
Katie's voice:
Hi, you've reached
david and katie.
- Leave a message.
-
Katie:
Hi, it's me.
I don't know what time it is.
The smallest sounds
are keeping me up.
Anyway, I just wanted
to say I miss you
And I wanted
to hear your voice.
I hope you're still
coming tomorrow.
Woman:
Harriet, just say it.
You can enjoy smoking,
all right?
No, 'cause you
called me.
My little sister's going
to go to medical school.
Can you believe this?
Congratulations, david.
You must be so proud.
- Where is the campus?
- It's in the bronx.
It's in the city.
And it has one of the best
pediatric programs
in the country.
Mrs. Mccarthy:
Jim, I always thought you
would become the doctor.
Thank you, ma.
That's nice. I feel
much better about my life.
-  I'm kidding.
- That's real nice, mom.
It's all right, jim.
Um, I can't find your jacket.
Do you know where you put it?
Oh, you're not leaving?
- No.
- Yes.
- I gotta drive--
- sit down, david. Come on,
what are you drinking?
I gotta drive all the way
back to the city.
So, katie?
Uh...
What? I-I--
I'm not going anywhere.
- I'm just--
I'll go start the car.
- Do whatever you want.
I'm not--
I'm not leaving yet.
What?
That we have
to rush home for?
What, david?
I'll be waiting in the car.
"what's so important that we
have to rush home for?"
Radio:
¶ that's the way I've always
heard it should be ¶
-
-
David:
Where are you going?
Where you going to go?
Where you going to live?
'Cause if you leave me,
I'm not going to be able
to subsidize your lifestyle.
Which I don't
think that you want.
I don't want that.
Look, can we just--
Think about this
for a second?
I've never been
closer to anyone
And I don't know you
at all.
Maybe I should go stay
at my mom's until I sort
things out.
You're joking, right?
Why would you give up
everything you've done
just because of him?
And you're not leaving
new york to move back to--
Long island-- yuck.
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
Your card was declined.
What?
I--
- Try it again.
- Well, I already did.
- Um...
- I don't understand.
- Um--
- do you have
another card,
Or cash?
It's only $22.75.
- I know how much it is.
- Here.
What the hell are you
looking at?
Eat your salad.
I just need enough money
to get through school.
Look, I'm trying
to explain.
Your husband is the beneficiary
of a number of family trusts,
Most of which were set up
a long time ago.
- I know that.
- That means that as long
as you're married,
You can have
access to his money,
but if you separate,
If you divorce him,
you won't get any money,
because he doesn't have any.
- Motherfuckers.
- Regardless,
Families like the marks
set their assets up this way
- To protect them
from divorces.
- Motherfuckers!
Okay, could you just not--
just not do that?
These people play hardball.
You're gonna have to think
of a way to motivate them.
How was your day?
Good.
I... Had lunch
with lauren today.
What else
did you do today?
What the hell is that?
-
- someone's up on the terrace.
Call the police.
Oh god.
- Jesus, jesus.
-
What happened?
What the hell happened?
- Kel, call the police.
- No no.
No!
No no no.
No no no...
Shh-shh, okay.
David.
Katie's next door
with us.
- She's scared to come home.
- Mm-hmm.
But it's nothing,
you know?
It's nothing.
I mean, it's not nothing,
But you can tell her
to come home.
It's over.
Will you tell her
to come home, please?
Actually I think she should
stay with us tonight.
Just let things
cool off between you.
Thank you.
Good night.
Thank you.
- Hi, lula.
- Hello, mrs. Marks.
- Um, is david in?
- No, he's upstairs
with his brother.
Okay, I'll be in his office.
I'm just gonna make some calls.
At the tone,
the time will be 11:59...
At the tone, the time
will be 11:59 and 20 seconds.
At the tone,
the time will be
I'm going to lunch
now, mrs. Marks.
Okay, lula.
Thanks.
At the tone,
the time will be
12:10 and 40 seconds.
Good evening,
mrs. Marks.
- Send it back.
- Excuse me, sir?
It's a family matter.
It has nothing to do
with us.
It's not just that you
barely show up for work
Or that you can't control
your home situation,
When you are here,
you're stoned most of the time.
There's an office on three.
It's out of the way.
No one will bother you.
You won't have to bother
with anything.
You keep your secretary,
get your mail...
I don't know
what else to say.
Dad?
Why couldn't you just have
given her what she wanted?
You're a very
weak man, david.
Lawyer:
Did there come a time
When your father
passed on control of
the marks organization?
Not to you, but to
your younger brother?
David:
Oh yeah, that's correct.
When that happened,
how did you feel?
Oh my god, katie.
- I'm sorry.
- No no, you said
you weren't coming.
Is everything okay?
Oh, I-- I don't know.
No. Is mom home?
No, she's still in florida.
oh!
I couldn't resist.
He--
Died when I was 16.
Uh, I don't remember much.
How did that happen,
you know?
And he does love me.
But I have to look out
for me now.
I have my whole
life to live.
Katie:
My father used to say
"we should never regret
the things we do,
Only the things
we don't do."
But...
I had-- I had an abortion.
And I don't know
what that is.
If it's something I did,
Or something I didn't do.
David:
Hello?
David?
- Don't cry.
-
You have to let me go.
This is killing me.
Oh, I know,
I know.
I know that now.
Just come home.
I can make this better,
I promise.
Baby, just come home.
Please.
What are you
looking at?
Katie?
Hey, katie,
where are you going?
I'm going home.
I'll call you in the morning.
You can't drive like this.
You've been drinking.
Come on.
Come on.
- Hey.
-
What are you doing?
You hungry?
Where's ivan?
Um... The kennel.
Oh, why?
You know he hates it there.
Yeah, I know,
but he bit me.
Here.
I'm cold.
What is it?
You would have made
a good mother.
-
-
Sanford:
So what am I doing here?
She must have hated you.
Your mother was a very
sick woman, david.
She wasn't always
like that though.
She was happy.
I did everything I could
for her, just like
I did for you.
Y-you-- you let me, uh...
Stay out there
and watch her jump.
I told the nanny
to take you inside.
That's not true.
You left me out there
to watch.
I saw her there,
you know?
On the driveway.
I thought
she was sleeping
So I tried
to wake her up.
- I touched her head--
- this is morbid.
Give me that.
How come you didn't
just pick me up, dad?
How come you just didn't
take me inside?
I thought if she saw you
standing there...
She wouldn't jump.
I'm going to bed.
She's gone.
What are you
talking about?
Now I'm just like you.
David!
Lawyer:
Something happened
in 1982
That kinda turned
your world upside down.
David!
David:
Yes sir.
We, uh...
We went to the lake
for the weekend
And I put her on
the train to go back into
the city that evening
And that was the last time
I ever saw her.
But according to statements
made to the police
at the time
She was in fact
seen later that night
At your apartment
in the city.
Miss katie.
Your doorman
said he saw her
the next morning,
Making a phone call
and getting
into a taxicab.
Uh, yeah, that's correct.
So at the time
there was a substantial
investigation
Into katie's
disappearance.
Yes sir.
And were you ever
considered a suspect?
No.
Woman:
As you know,
katherine marks
Has been missing now
for five days.
David, her husband,
is very distraught.
And so he's asked that I speak
to you on his behalf.
Now the marks family is
offering a $15,000 reward
For any information
that leads
To the discovery
of katie's whereabouts.
I'm sorry, but,
uh, for the moment
That's all I'm able
to tell you. Thank you.
Thank you.
There'll be no more
questions at this time.
- Can we just get
a phone number?
- Thank you.
Please, can you just respect
the family's need for privacy
At this very very
difficult time?
We'll keep you up to date
if anything new comes along.
Where are we going next?
Uh, we haven't covered
west end below 70th.
We can start again
early in the morning.
Yeah.
It's all right.
Lawyer:
So, david, I want
to get you now
Um,
If I could have
some water?
Right away.
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.
And a close look
at the case,
I've decided to reopen
the investigation
Into the disappearance
of katherine marks.
Katherine
disappeared in 1982,
Almost 20 years ago
And she remains
a missing person to this day.
Now there are plenty of people
who thought they got away
with crimes
That we're now finding
can be solved
Based on dna
and other forensic evidence.
And I'm sure that
puts a lot of people
on edge right now.
Lawyer:
Well, what did you
believe was going on?
David:
Well, it was clear to me
that the district attorney
Was reopening
the investigation to further
her political career.
There wasn't anybody
who didn't know about it.
You couldn't walk down
the street, you couldn't walk
past the newspaper stand.
It was just, you know,
Everywhere.
Intended to fill up my car
With clothing and linen
and go somewhere
And hide
and disguise myself.
That the problem was
being david marks...
So I just wanted not to be
david marks anymore.
-
- man: Hey!
Do you mind?
Can you just hold it
down a little bit?
You know, it's just very
abrasive on my ears.
And you don't have to let
the door slam like that.
You know, I just need
a little consideration.
What?
Lawyer:
So now you're living
in galveston, texas,
And you meet malvern bump
for the first time.
Did you pretend
to be mute?
David:
Uh, yeah.
Yeah well, just be sure
and turn the hall light off
When you're coming and leaving,
'cause it's on my meter.
Do you think malvern
believed you were a mute?
Do you think
he believed you
were a woman?
Reporter:
this lakeside cottage
Was a weekend retreat
for new york real estate heir
David marks and his
wife katherine, a beautiful
young medical student.
Now according
to westchester county
district attorney janice rizzo,
It is being considered
a possible crime scene.
Earlier today,
in an exhaustive search,
Unfortunately
for hopeful investigators,
It was just the remains
of a dead dog.
Sources inside
the da's office say
that rizzo's interest
In the case was triggered
by an unpublished manuscript
Written by this woman,
deborah lehrman.
Lehrman's novel apparently
describes a murder,
- The details of which
are strikingly similar...
-
...To those surrounding
the disappearance of
katie marks in 1982.
Investigators are also
interested in talking
to david marks,
But at the moment,
no one seems to be able
to find him.
- Reporting live...
-
- David's voice:
Leave a message.
-
I can't believe this
is happening again.
I don't know how
people get my number.
It was this reporter
And now a cop's calling
from new york
Every five minutes.
And I want to be there
for you, david, uh, I do,
But, uh--
I have my own problems now.
Fuck...
It's nothing serious,
but my car needs--
it needs some repairs.
Life in los angeles
without one is impossible.
- Come on, let's go.
-
- And uh...
- Lulu, let's go.
Oh fuck!
- Shit. Come on.
- I hate myself
for asking, but...
Come on!
- I don't know
if this is record--
-
- Leave a message.
-
Deborah:
David, why are you
avoiding me?
I've always been
there for you.
I've been a good--
a good friend to you.
- Don't you fucking--
-
Malvern:
Who says I'm bothering 'em?
I pay my rent
like everybody else.
Man:
You've got
I pay you!
I pay good money
for this shithole!
Get away.
I got rights here.
What rights?
You got 30 days
to get out, malvern.
You're lucky I don't
call the cops.
- Malvern: Where am I gonna go?
- Whatever.
You got
And stop turning off
the goddamn light.
It's on my meter.
Lawyer:
What sort
of relationship
Developed between
you and malvern?
David:
We became
good friends.
Where the hell did you
learn to shoot like that?
- The purple heart...
- I swear to god.
...For a sunburn.
-
- and then we spent
the entire war
Shooting coconuts off
the side of the boat.
Why do you wear
all that shit for
anyway?
What?
The girl stuff.
You like
that kind of thing?
No.
I guess...
I just kinda
want to disappear
for a little while.
What about you?
Is that why you came out here?
Yeah.
Me, I--
I disappeared
a long time ago.
Oh.
You know,
I'm not always home
And I know how you like
to watch television.
So...
You seem like someone
I can trust.
You know, I may need you to do
something for me one day.
Thanks.
Lawyer:
In the days
and weeks to come,
Did malvern become
aware that you had
a lot of money?
David:
I mean, he became
aware that I was
Planning
on buying a house.
What effect did you see
that have on malvern?
Well, malvern had
a problem.
And I guess he thought
I was gonna be the solution.
I can remember looking
at houses together,
And, you know, he was
saying things like,
"well, this would be
a good place for you to buy
Because there'd be room
for me over there."
Yeah, it was
very uncomfortable.
This place might be
good for us, malvern.
Leave a message.
Deborah:
David, I need to see you.
If I don't
hear from you, I--
I'm gonna blow
the lid off things.
You know what
I'm talking about.
- David?
-
-
- I know. David?
David!
You didn't give me time
to clean up.
- Turn that down.
- Tv: ...Benefits eclipse
the 400,000 watermark
- To 411,000 last week...
- Cocksucker.
David, you're gonna
go deaf.
-
-
Leave a message.
Malvern:
David, are you there?
Everything
is taken care of.
You told me to call, so...
I'm calling.
I just need
something to eat.
I haven't had anything to eat
and there's no food here.
So I thought, well,
Maybe I'd stop
on the way back and--
Hello, yes,
My friend and I
came to your open house
a few weeks ago,
Uh, for unit 107.
Deborah lehrman
wasn't just killed,
it was an execution.
Her death is a very
questionable death, michelle.
Not just in terms of the fact
that it was a homicide,
But the timing
is extremely curious.
Curious because
deborah lehrman
was murdered
Just before
district attorney
janice rizzo had
Intended to question her
about another mystery--
The disappearance
Of a beautiful young
medical student
named katherine--
Okay, you have the "post"
interview, marks,
Then a phoner with w.I.N.S.
Also about the marks case,
Which we can do
from the car.
We got a call
from albany.
They want you to do
that meeting tonight.
- Got the numbers
I asked for?
- Yeah.
They've been very
generous to the governor.
Totals are in
the last column.
These are all
from the marks family?
I'll have to change.
Leave a message.
David?
Come on, david.
I know what's going on.
She says you never even
made an offer.
I trusted you.
We had a deal.
Pick up the fucking phone!
- Hello.
- Mr. Sachs.
- Solly. Good to see you.
- You too.
- Pl-please.
- Yes.
Oh.
- No no, don't get up.
- Thank you for coming.
My pleasure.
Now what can I
do for you?
Some things
have been happening
That have been
quite uncomfortable
for my family.
You want the ship to go down?
We're in a typhoon.
Lawyer:
So, david, on the night
in question
You came home and found
malvern had been evicted.
-
- david: Uh, yes.
Explain to the jury,
please, what happened
then.
...That pays attention
to my orders?
Engine room reports
number one switchboard
Shorted out by saltwater.
Shifted to number two.
Can't do much better
heading into the wind.
-
- I trusted you!
Fleet course is 1800.
Captain, we're in
serious trouble.
Mr. Marik, if you
question my decisions once more,
I'll order you off this bridge.
You're not giving orders
on this bridge anymore.
I've relieved you...
Mr. Marik,
you're under arrest...
Lawyer:
So malvern came at you
with a gun?
David:
That's correct.
He, uh,
had been evicted
And I just wasn't
gonna do that.
If malvern's death was
a matter of self-defense,
Why didn't you
call the police?
Because I knew that no one
would believe me.
I just knew that
no one would believe
So I had to get rid
of the body.
So no one
would believe you
because of your past?
- I'm sorry?
- Your past.
Did you kill
your best friend
deborah lehrman?
Um...
David, you're gonna
go deaf.
No.
Can you think of any
connection between the death
Of deborah lehrman
and the disappearance
of your wife katie marks?
No sir.
David, is there anything
you would like to add?
Sanford:
David!
Lawyer:
Anything else, david?
No.
I have no more
questions.
I miss her so much.
