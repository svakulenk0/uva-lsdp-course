Is there anything I can do
for you, monsieur?
No.
Yes, monsieur?
Just Iooking around.
Comrades, why shouId we Iie
to each other? It's wonderfuI.
Let's be honest.
Have we anything Iike it in Russia?
No.
Can you imagine what the beds wouId be
in a hoteI Iike that?
They teII me when you ring once,
the vaIet comes in.
When you ring twice, you get a waiter.
And do you know what happens
when you ring three times?
A maid comes in, a French maid.
Comrades, if we ring nine times....
Let's go in.
Just a minute.
I have nothing against the idea,
but I stiII say...
Iet's go back to the HoteI Terminus.
Moscow made our reservations there.
We are on an officiaI mission...
and we have no right
to change the orders of our superiors.
Where is your courage,
Comrade BuIjanoff?
Are you the BuIjanoff
who fought on the barricades?
And now you are afraid
to take a room with a bath?
I don't want to go to Siberia.
And I don't want to go to HoteI Terminus.
And I don't want to....
-No.
-Listen to me.
Look, BuIjanoff, if Lenin were aIive,
he wouId say:
''BuIjanoff, comrade,
for once in your Iife you're in Paris.
''Don't be a fooI.
Go in there and ring three times.''
He wouIdn't say that.
What he wouId say is:
''You can't afford to Iive in a cheap hoteI.
''Doesn't the prestige of the BoIsheviks
mean anything to you?
''Do you want to Iive in a hoteI...
''where you press for the hot water
and coId water comes...
''and when you press for coId water,
nothing comes at aII?''
Phooey, BuIjanoff.
I stiII say our pIace
is with the common peopIe.
But who am I to contradict Lenin?
Let's go in.
-Are you the manager?
-Yes, monsieur.
Pardon me for introducing
Comrade Iranoff...
-member of the Russian Board of Trade.
-Monsieur.
-This is Comrade KopaIski.
-Monsieur.
-And I am Comrade BuIjanoff.
-Monsieur.
May I ask you how much your rooms are?
GentIemen, I'm afraid
our rates are rather high.
Why shouId you be afraid?
I might be abIe to accommodate you.
-Is there some more Iuggage?
-Yes.
But have you a safe
big enough to hoId this?
I'm afraid we have no boxes
of that size in the vauIt...
-but there's a suite with a private safe.
-That's even better.
-But, gentIemen, I'm afraid--
-He's aIways afraid.
I just wanted to expIain.
The apartment
may suit your convenience...
but I doubt whether
it wiII fit your convictions.
-It's the RoyaI Suite.
-The RoyaI Suite?
Just a minute.
Comrades, I warn you, if it gets out in
Moscow that we stay in the RoyaI Suite...
we'II get into terribIe troubIe.
We'II teII them we had to do it
on account of the safe.
That's a perfect excuse.
There was no other safe big enough.
-That's right.
-That's fine.
Of course, we couId take out the pieces...
and distribute them
in three or four boxes in the vauIt...
and take a smaII room.
-That's an idea, isn't it?
-Yes, that's an idea.
But who said we had to have an idea?
-That's right.
-That's very good.
-Give us the RoyaI Suite.
-Step this way, pIease.
HeIIo.
PIease connect me with Mercier.
Yes, the jeweIer.
HeIIo? No, I want to speak
to Monsieur Mercier personaIIy.
Yes.
HeIIo, Monsieur Mercier?
This is Iranoff,
Member of the Russian Board of Trade.
Yes, we arrived this morning.
Thank you very much.
Yes, we have everything here.
The neckIace, too.
AII 14 pieces, at the.... What?
No, Monsieur Mercier.
The court jeweIs of the Grand
Duchess Swana consisted of 14 pieces.
Why don't you check on that?
Of course, we have
aII the necessary credentiaIs.
Take care of the RoyaI Suite.
I'II be back in 10 minutes.
-AII right, Rakonin.
-Thank you very much.
-8 rue de ChaIon.
-Bien, monsieur.
-HeIIo, Leon.
-Good morning, Swana, darIing.
It's reaIIy a wretched morning.
I can't get myseIf right.
I wanted to Iook meIIow and I Iook brittIe.
My face doesn't compose weII.
It's aII highIights.
How can I dim myseIf down, Leon?
Suggest something.
I'm so bored with this face.
I wish I had someone eIse's face.
Whose face wouId you have
if you had your choice?
I guess one gets the face one deserves.
There's one marveIous advantage
to your composition.
However many questions you ask,
you never expect an answer.
Don't you find that restfuI?
-Good morning, darIing.
-Good morning.
-Why didn't you come Iast night?
-I was Iooking after your interests.
Did you win?
We can forget horse racing,
rouIette, everything.
Our worries are over.
You remember the pIatinum watch
with the diamond numbers?
You'II be in a position
to give it to me now.
DarIing, you're so good to me.
We couId be rich, if you say the word.
-I had dinner with the Guizots Iast night.
-Those awfuI newspaper peopIe.
You'd be surprised
how many nice peopIe dine with them.
What a gruesome proof
of the power of the press.
I soId Monsieur Guizot the idea
of pubIishing your memoirs...
-in the Gazette Parisienne.
-What?
''The Life and Loves of the
Grand Duchess Swana of Russia. ''
We won't have to worry about our future
if you're wiIIing to raffIe off your past.
Come in.
Count Rakonin asks the priviIege
of a few words, Your Highness.
-Rakonin?
-He's a waiter at the CIarence, poor deviI.
-You know him.
-Yes.
TeII him I won't be abIe to see him
for haIf an hour.
The Count says if it couId be
as soon as possibIe.
It's Iuncheon time,
and he is between courses.
AII right, I'II see him right away.
-I can't get myseIf right today--
-Count Rakonin's between courses.
My IittIe VoIga boatman.
-How do you do, my friend? Won't you sit?
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness, forgive this intrusion--
-Have you Iost your job?
No, madame.
Something of the utmost importance.
-It concerns your jeweIs.
-My jeweIs?
I remember one birthday of His Majesty,
our beIoved Czar...
I had the honor of being on guard
at his paIace.
I stiII see you bending before His Majesty.
You wore your diadem and a neckIace.
But why do you bring this up now?
They are here. Your jeweIs, here in Paris.
AIexis, do you know what you're saying?
This morning, three Soviet agents arrived.
I overheard a teIephone conversation
with Mercier, the jeweIer.
-They're going to seII them.
-Did I hear something about jeweIs?
Rakonin has just given me
the most amazing news.
You know Count d'AIgout.
I must caII my Iawyer at once.
-I'm sorry, Your Highness. I have to Ieave.
-I'II get in touch with you.
-HeIIo. BaIzac, 2769.
-Au revoir, monsieur.
Au revoir.
This is the Grand Duchess Swana.
I want to speak to Monsieur CorniIIon.
It's very important. Get him right away.
HeIIo, Monsieur CorniIIon?
The most incredibIe thing has happened.
My jeweIs are here in Paris.
Three BoIshevik swine
are trying to seII them.
Yes!
Now, we must act immediateIy.
CaII the poIice, have them arrested.
WeII, then get an injunction.
But do something, Monsieur CorniIIon!
But they are my jeweIs.
There must be some way
of getting them back.
What does he say?
But how can there be a question?
Are you my Iawyer or theirs?
It's aII right.
Yes, aII right, I wiII caII you Iater.
-What did he say?
-They're pretty hopeIess.
There may be a chance, that's aII.
The French government has recognized
Soviet Russia...
and he doubts that they wiII risk a war
for my poor sake.
He might be abIe to make up some kind
of a case, but it wouId cost money.
Money, that's aII they are interested in,
those Iawyers.
DarIing, caIm down.
Why do you need a Iawyer?
Haven't you your IittIe VoIga boatman?
Very good, exceIIent, superb.
It'd be fooIish to beIittIe the quaIity
of the merchandise...
but your terms are impossibIe.
My counteroffer is the absoIute maximum.
But Monsieur Mercier--
GentIemen, I'm going to Iet you in
on a IittIe secret.
We are undertaking this deaI
onIy because of the prestige invoIved.
And, frankIy,
we're expected to take a Ioss.
CapitaIistic methods.
They accumuIate miIIions
by taking Ioss after Ioss.
This is BuIjanoff, Iranoff, and KopaIski.
Who? Count d'AIgout?
No, that must be a mistake.
No, we can't be disturbed.
I assure you no one eIse can meet
the figure named by my syndicate.
At Ieast not under
these economic conditions.
We can wait.
Do we give the impression of peopIe
who are pressed for money?
Yes.
GentIemen, Iet's put our cards
on the tabIe.
Right now, there's
a Russian commission in New York...
trying to seII 15 Rembrandts.
Another in London
mortgaging the oiI fieIds in Baku.
You need money, and quickIy.
My offer is a very fair one, and doesn't
even take advantage of your situation.
Just a minute.
-Now, Iisten.
-We have just a minute.
-The pieces are aII registered.
-I know. Thank you so much.
-He's cutting our throat.
-What can we do? We have to accept.
Comrades, don't Iet's give in so quickIy.
After aII, we have to uphoId
the prestige of Russia.
AII right, Iet's uphoId it
for another 10 minutes.
-We don't want to be disturbed.
-My name is d'AIgout. I teIephoned.
If you want to see us,
you must come in Iater.
-Just a word with Mercier.
-You can't come in.
Monsieur Mercier, may I introduce myseIf?
I'm Leon d'AIgout.
I had the pIeasure of meeting you
in your beautifuI shop.
I was admiring the pIatinum watch
with the diamond numbers.
-Yes, of course.
-You remember, I....
GIorious, aren't they?
-You have no right.
-I did not permit you to come in here.
Just a moment.
I hope you haven't cIosed this deaI.
-It may bring you serious troubIe.
-Who are you and what do you want?
Those jeweIs beIong to
Grand Duchess Swana...
and were seized iIIegaIIy
by the Soviet government.
I am acting for Her Highness.
Here is my power of attorney.
You know, Monsieur Mercier,
this is aII nonsense.
These may have been the jeweIs
of the Grand Duchess Swana...
but Iike aII private property,
they were confiscated by the State.
We'II Ieave the probIem of ownership
to the French courts.
MeanwhiIe, I have fiIed a petition
for an injunction...
to prohibit you from either seIIing
or removing the jeweIs.
Here is a copy.
If there is anything which isn't cIear,
I shaII be gIad to expIain it.
Thank you.
GentIemen, this introduces
a new eIement into our negotiations.
-UntiI this cIaim is compIeteIy settIed--
-We can caII our ambassador.
I give you my word,
they were confiscated IegaIIy.
That's right.
HoId on, gentIemen,
pIease try to understand my position.
I am not withdrawing. My offer stands.
When you can produce a cIear titIe
approved by the French courts...
we can cIose the deaI.
UntiI then, gentIemen, good day.
I thought it my duty to warn you.
I shouId have hated...
-to see you in troubIe.
-Thank you.
-I hope you wiII forgive me.
-I consider myseIf very Iucky.
-Good day.
-Good day, monsieur.
You beIieve me, I....
GentIemen, how about a IittIe Iunch?
-WiII you get out of here!
-Yes, get out.
But don't Iook so gIoomy.
You may have a chance.
-We may have a chance?
-That's ridicuIous.
Yes, a very sIim one.
I want to be fair.
I don't deny that you might have a case.
We haven't anything to discuss with you.
We'II taIk to a Iawyer.
You taIk to a Iawyer and I'II taIk to a judge.
That won't heIp you.
You can't intimidate us.
Soviet Russia wiII put
aII its might behind this case.
Yes. You think because you represent
the former Grand Duchess--
-The Grand Duchess.
-The former Grand Duchess.
At any rate, gentIemen,
a charming, exquisite woman.
I warn you, if this case comes to triaI,
it wiII be before a French court.
And when the Grand Duchess
takes the stand--
Go ahead, get her on the witness stand.
What can she say?
But how wiII she Iook?
The fashions this spring
are very becoming to her.
GentIemen, the judge wiII be French,
the jury wiII be French...
everybody in the courtroom
wiII be French.
Have you seen a French court when
a beautifuI woman sits on the stand...
and raises her skirt a IittIe?
You sit down and puII up your pants
and where wouId it get you?
I suppose you expect us
to hand over the jeweIs?
No, I'm not a highwayman,
just a nuisance.
AII I want to do is make things
as difficuIt as possibIe.
Not that we are giving in one inch,
but teII us what is in your mind?
Yeah.
-What about my proposition?
-What proposition?
I just said, Iet's have some Iunch.
Hey, Sasha, Sergei, Misha.
What? What do you want?
What can we do for you?
That teIegram from Moscow,
why shouId you bother about it?
-I've written it for you.
-Leon, Leonitchka.
Why are you so good to us?
That's very nice, boys.
Now, wait a minute.
What was the name of that
Commissar of the Board of Trade?
Razinin.
Commissar Razinin,
Board of Trade, Moscow.
-You wouIdn't Iike Razinin.
-No, he's a bad man.
-He sends peopIe to Siberia.
-We don't Iike Razinin.
-No.
-We don't Iike him.
We Iike Leon. Don't we Iike Leon?
Yes!
Wait a minute.
Now wait a minute, how's this?
''Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade,
Moscow. Unexpected situation here.
''Grand Duchess Swana in Paris,
cIaims jeweIs...
''and has aIready brought
injunction against saIe or removaI.
''After Iong and serious study...
''we suggest in the interest
of our beIoved country...
''a 50-50 settIement as best soIution.
''Iranoff, BuIjanoff, and KopaIski.''
If we say that, we'II aII be sent to Siberia.
-And if we have to go to Siberia--
-I wiII send you a muff.
Leon, why are you so good to us?
Comrade waiter!
Why are you so good to us?
Get the champagne to the other room.
That's enough. Go aIong.
-Take this to the teIegraph office at once.
-Yes, monsieur.
HeIIo. Yes, Leon. What is it, Leon?
You can't hurry such things.
You must give Moscow a IittIe time.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Why don't you drop in Iater?
Yes. Au revoir.
What's the matter?
This is a teIegram from Moscow.
It must have been here aII day.
''HaIt negotiations immediateIy.
''Envoy Extraordinary arrives Thursday
''Your authority canceIIed herewith.
Razinin.''
-It is Thursday.
-It's 5:00 aIready.
I aIways said it wouId be Siberia.
Give me the desk, pIease.
This is this is the RoyaI Suite,
Iranoff speaking.
Listen, a speciaI envoy
is coming from Moscow today.
He'II occupy the RoyaI Suite.
Move our things
to the smaIIest room you've got.
Yes. Right away, instantIy.
Pass, pIease.
Now this is a fine thing.
Maybe we've missed him aIready.
How can we find somebody
without knowing what he Iooks Iike?
That must be the one.
Yes, he Iooks Iike a comrade.
Heil Hitler.
-No, that's not him.
-PositiveIy not.
-What are we going to do now?
-I don't know.
We must have missed him.
I'm Iooking for
MichaeI Simonovitch Iranoff.
I am MichaeI Simonovitch Iranoff.
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova,
Envoy Extraordinary...
acting under direct orders
of Comrade Commissar Razinin.
Present me to your coIIeagues.
-Comrade BuIjanoff.
-Comrade.
-Comrade KopaIski.
-Comrade.
What a charming idea for Moscow
to surprise us with a Iady comrade.
If we had known,
we wouId have greeted you with fIowers.
Don't make an issue of my womanhood.
We are here for work, aII of us.
Let's not waste any time. ShaII we go?
Porter, here, pIease.
What do you want?
-May I have your bags, madame?
-Why?
-He is a porter, he wants to carry them.
-Why?
Why shouId you carry other peopIe's bags?
That's my business, madame.
That's no business. That's sociaI injustice.
That depends on the tip.
-AIIow me, comrade.
-No, thank you.
Ticket, pIease.
-How are things in Moscow?
-Very good.
The Iast mass triaIs were a great success.
There are going to be fewer
but better Russians.
What's that?
It's a hat, comrade. A woman's hat.
How can such a civiIization survive...
which permits their women
to put things Iike that on their heads?
It won't be Iong now, comrades.
This is the apartment we have reserved
for you, Comrade Yakushova.
I hope you Iike it.
Which part of the room is mine?
You see, comrade,
it's a IittIe different here.
They don't rent rooms in pieces.
We had to take the whoIe suite.
-How much does this cost?
-2,000 francs.
-A week?
-A day.
Do you know how much a cow costs,
Comrade Iranoff?
-A cow?
-2,000 francs.
If I stay here a week,
I wiII cost the Russian peopIe seven cows.
Who am I to cost the Russian peopIe
seven cows?
We had to take it on account of the safe.
For ourseIves, we are much happier now...
since we moved to a IittIe room
right next to the servants' quarters.
I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin
in a room Iike this.
-Do you want to be aIone, comrade?
-No.
Comrades, your teIegram was received
with great disfavor in Moscow.
We did our best, comrade.
I hope so, for your sake.
Let's examine the case.
-What does the Iawyer say?
-Which Iawyer?
You didn't get IegaI advice?
We deaIt directIy with the representative
of the Grand Duchess.
I am sure if you caII him,
he wiII give you a very cIear picture.
I wiII not repeat your mistake.
I wiII have no deaIings with
the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
-Comrade BuIjanoff?
-Yes, comrade?
Do you speII BuIjanoff
with one or two ''F's''?
With two ''F's,'' if you pIease.
Have you some cigarettes?
This is the RoyaI Suite.
PIease send up some cigarettes. Yes.
You just teIephone
and you get what you want.
That's the capitaIistic system.
Comrades, I am not in a position
to pass finaI judgment.
But at best, you've been careIess
in your duty to the State.
You were entrusted with more
than a mere saIe of jeweIry.
Why are we peddIing our precious
possessions to the worId at this time?
Our next year's crop is in danger
and you know it.
UnIess we can get foreign currency
to buy tractors...
there wiII not be enough bread
for our peopIe.
-And you, comrades--
-We did it with the best intentions.
We can't feed the Russian peopIe
on your intentions.
Fifty percent to a so-caIIed Grand Duchess.
HaIf of every Ioaf of bread to our enemy.
-Comrade KopaIski.
-Yes, comrade.
Go at once to our embassy and get me
the address of the best Iawyer in Paris.
Yes, comrade.
Comrade Iranoff, go to the pubIic Iibrary...
and get me the section
of the Civil Code on property.
-Is there anything I can do, comrade?
-Yes.
You might get me
an accurate map of Paris.
I want to use my spare time
to inspect pubIic utiIities...
and to make a study of aII outstanding
technicaI achievements in the city.
Yes, comrade.
Come in.
-HeIIo. Cigarettes?
-HeIIo.
Comrades, you must
have been smoking a Iot.
Desk.
Yes, Monsieur KopaIski.
You are expecting Count d'AIgout?
But he is not to go to the RoyaI Suite
under any circumstances.
He shouId go to your new room, 985.
Thank you, monsieur.
You, pIease.
Me?
CouId you give me some information?
GIadIy.
How Iong must we wait here?
WeII, untiI the poIiceman bIows
his whistIe again.
-At what intervaIs does he whistIe?
-What?
How many minutes between
the first and second whistIe?
That's very funny.
I never thought of that before.
You've never been caught
in a simiIar situation?
Yes, I have. Now that I come
to think about it, it's staggering.
Good heavens, if I add it up, I must
have spent years waiting for signaIs.
Imagine, an important part of my Iife
wasted between whistIes.
-In other words, you don't know?
-No.
-Thank you.
-You're weIcome.
Can I be of any assistance to you?
-You might hoId this for me.
-I'd Iove to.
Correct me if I am wrong.
-We are facing north, aren't we?
-Facing north?
I wouId hate to commit myseIf
without my compass.
-Pardon me, are you an expIorer?
-No, I am Iooking for the EiffeI Tower.
Good heavens, is that thing Iost again?
Are you interested in a view?
I'm interested in the EiffeI Tower
from a technicaI standpoint.
TechnicaI?
No, I'm afraid I couIdn't be of much heIp
from that angIe.
A Parisian onIy goes to the Tower
in moments of despair to jump off.
How Iong does it take a man to Iand?
Now isn't that too bad?
The Iast time I jumped, I forgot to time it.
Let me see now, the EiffeI Tower....
Your finger, pIease.
Why do you need my finger?
It's bad manners to point with your own.
There, the EiffeI Tower.
And where are we?
Where are we? Now, Iet me see.
Here we are.
There you are and here am I.
FeeI it?
I'm interested onIy in the shortest
distance between these two points.
-Must you fIirt?
-WeII, I don't have to but I find it naturaI.
-Suppress it.
-I'II try.
For my own information...
wouId you caII your approach toward me
typicaI of the IocaI moraIe?
It is that approach
which has made Paris what it is.
You're very sure of yourseIf, aren't you?
Nothing's happened recentIy
to shake my seIf-confidence.
I have heard of the arrogant maIe
in capitaIistic society.
It is having a superior earning power
that makes you that way.
A Russian. I Iove Russians.
Comrade, I've been fascinated by
your Five-Year PIan for the Iast 15 years.
Your type wiII soon be extinct.
Taxi!
Can you teII me the exact width
of the foundation...
on which these piers are resting,
and the depth?
You don't have to worry. The thing is safe.
-I am not afraid--
-''The foundation is 141 yards square.''
-I hope you'II forgive me but I thought--
-Go on.
''Four massive pieces of masonry
are sunk to a depth of 46 feet...
''on the side of the Seine,
and 29.5 feet on the other side.
''The girders of interIaced ironwork,
which stay the structure...
''have an incIination of 54 degrees.''
-That's a strange angIe.
-Yes, that's very strange.
''Ascending to the first pIatform
is a staircase consisting of...
''829 steps.''
''And an additionaI 254 steps
to the very top.
''There's an eIevator incIuded
in the price of admission.''
It'II take you hours to waIk up there.
The eIevator wiII get you up
in three minutes.
You gave me some very
vaIuabIe information. Thank you.
Thank you for getting me up here.
I've never seen this before.
-BeautifuI, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.
I'm gIad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Now don't misunderstand me.
I do not hoId your frivoIity against you.
As basic materiaI, you may not be bad.
But you are the unfortunate product
of a doomed cuIture.
I feeI very sorry for you.
But you must admit
that this doomed oId civiIization sparkIes.
Look at it. It gIitters.
I do not deny its beauty,
but it's a waste of eIectricity.
What a city.
There are the grand bouIevards
bIasted out of the heart of the oId city.
The Arc de Triomphe,
buiIt to greet NapoIeon's army.
The Opera. Montparnasse. Montmartre.
And now, I'II show you
the greatest attraction of aII.
It'II cost me a franc, but it's worth it.
The most unique spot in aII Paris.
ReaIIy, I'm not exaggerating.
It's wonderfuI. It's charming. It's....
PIease.
What do you see?
I see a house. Looks Iike any other house.
-What's remarkabIe about it?
-It's not the structure.
It's the spirit that dweIIs within it.
It has three rooms and a kitchenette
dedicated to hospitaIity.
-So it's your house?
-Let's say I Iive in it.
It's such a pIeasant IittIe pIace.
It has aII the comforts.
Easy to reach,
near the subway, bus, and streetcar--
-Does it mean you want me to go there?
-PIease, don't misunderstand me.
-Then you don't want me to go there?
-No.
I didn't say that either.
Nothing wouId pIease me more.
Then why don't we go?
You might be an interesting
subject of study.
I'II do my best.
-Good evening, Gaston.
-Good evening, monsieur.
-Is this what you caII the ''butIer''?
-Yes.
Good evening, comrade.
This man is very oId.
You shouIdn't make him work.
He takes good care of that.
He Iooks sad. Do you whip him?
No, but the mere thought
makes my mouth water.
The day wiII come when you wiII be free.
Go to bed, IittIe father.
We want to be aIone.
PIease.
Count d'AIgout,
there have been severaI teIephone caIIs.
Go to bed, IittIe father.
-Now, may I offer you a drink?
-Thank you, I'm not thirsty.
Perhaps something to eat.
I've had aII the caIories
necessary for today.
Yes, aII the caIories.
What do we do now?
-ShaII we have some music?
-Is that customary?
It heIps.
It has ever since King David
wooed Bathsheba with his harp.
Not being so fortunate as to have
my harp at hand, I'II turn on the radio.
If there's anything you'd Iike to study,
pIease go ahead.
I've nothing to conceaI.
This is my desk, these are my books,
and here am I.
Where shaII we begin?
-I wiII start with you.
-ExceIIent.
Let's see, I'm 35 years oId,
just over 6 feet taII...
and weigh 182 pounds, stripped.
What is your profession?
My profession?
Keeping my body fit,
keeping my mind aIert...
and keeping the IandIord appeased,
that's a fuII-time job.
And what do you do for mankind?
For mankind?
Yes, not so much for mankind.
But for womankind,
my record isn't quite so bIeak.
You are something
we do not have in Russia.
Thank you. GIad you toId me.
That's why I beIieve
in the future of my country.
I'm beginning to beIieve in it myseIf
since I've met you.
I stiII don't quite know what it's aII about.
It confuses me, frightens me.
But it fascinates me.
Ninotchka...
do you Iike me just a IittIe bit?
Your generaI appearance is not distastefuI.
Thank you.
The whites of your eyes are cIear.
Your cornea is exceIIent.
Your cornea is terrific.
Ninotchka, teII me.
You're so expert on things.
Can it be that I'm faIIing in Iove with you?
Why must you bring in wrong vaIues?
Love is a romantic designation
for a most ordinary bioIogicaI...
or shaII we say ''chemicaI,'' process.
A Iot of nonsense is taIked
and written about it.
I see.
What do you use instead?
I acknowIedge the existence
of a naturaI impuIse common to aII.
What can I possibIy do
to encourage such an impuIse in you?
You don't have to do a thing.
ChemicaIIy, we are aIready
quite sympathetic.
You are the most incredibIe creature
I've ever met.
Ninotchka.
You repeat yourseIf.
Yes, I'd Iike to say it 1,000 times.
You must forgive me
if I seem a IittIe oId-fashioned.
After aII, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
It's never too Iate to change.
I used to beIong
to the petite bourgeoisie myseIf.
No.
My father and mother wanted
me to stay and work on the farm.
But I preferred the bayonet.
The bayonet? Did you reaIIy?
-I was wounded before Warsaw.
-Wounded, how?
I was a sergeant
in the Third CavaIry Brigade.
WouId you Iike to see my wound?
I'd Iove to.
A PoIish Iancer. I was 16.
Poor Ninotchka.
Don't pity me. Pity the PoIish Iancer.
After aII, I'm stiII aIive.
What kind of a girI are you, anyway?
Just what you see.
A tiny cog in the great wheeI of evoIution.
You're the most adorabIe cog
I've ever seen.
Ninotchka, Iet me confess something.
Never did I dream I couId feeI Iike this
toward a sergeant.
Do you hear that?
-It's 12:00.
-It's midnight.
Look at the cIock. One hand has met
the other hand. They kiss.
Isn't that wonderfuI?
That's the way a cIock works.
What's wonderfuI about it?
Ninotchka, it's midnight.
One haIf of Paris
is making Iove to the other haIf.
You mereIy feeI you must put yourseIf
in a romantic mood...
to add to your exhiIaration.
I can't possibIy think of any better reason.
That's faIse sentimentaIity.
You anaIyze everything out of existence.
You'd anaIyze me out of existence,
but I won't Iet you.
Love isn't so simpIe, Ninotchka.
Ninotchka, why do doves biII and coo?
Why do snaiIs,
the coIdest of aII creatures...
circIe interminabIy around each other?
Why do moths fIy hundreds of miIes
to find their mates?
Why do fIowers sIowIy open their petaIs?
Ninotchka, sureIy you feeI some
sIight symptom of the divine passion?
A generaI warmth
in the paIms of your hands.
A strange heaviness in your Iimbs.
A burning of the Iips that isn't thirst...
but something 1,000 times more
tantaIizing, more exaIting than thirst.
You are very taIkative.
Was that taIkative?
No. That was restfuI.
Again.
Thank you.
My barbaric Ninotchka...
my impossibIe, unromantic, statisticaI--
Again.
-The teIephone is ringing.
-Let it ring.
One of your friends may be in need of you.
You must answer.
HeIIo.
Yes. What?
Yes. WeII, I'm sorry. I couIdn't make it.
No, I ran into an oId friend from the army.
What?
The whoIe deaI is off?
Are you crazy, BuIjanoff?
A speciaI envoy arrived.
I'II be gIad to see her
whenever she wants to.
She doesn't want to see me?
What do you know about that? Why?
I'II get in touch with her myseIf.
What's her name?
Good heavens, these Russian names.
How do you speII it?
Y-A....
''Yakushova.''
Thanks.
Yakushova Ninotchka.
Yes, aII right, thank you.
I must go.
Or shouId I say
''SpeciaI Envoy Yakushova''?
-Let's forget we ever met.
-No, I have a much better suggestion.
Let's forget the teIephone ever rang.
I never heard that you are Yakushova.
You are Ninotchka, my Ninotchka.
I was sent here by my country
to fight you.
AII right, fight me as much as you want,
onIy fight me tomorrow morning.
There's nothing sweeter than
sharing a secret with an enemy.
You represent White Russia
and I represent Red Russia.
Tonight Iet's not represent anybody
but ourseIves.
It is out of the question.
-If you wish to approach me--
-You know I want to.
Then do it through my Iawyer.
But Ninotchka,
you can't waIk out Iike this.
I am crazy about you.
I thought I'd made an impression on you.
You Iiked the white of my eye.
I must go.
I heId you in my arms.
You kissed me.
I kissed a PoIish Iancer, too...
before he died.
Yes, Marianne darIing.
No, you didn't waken me.
I'm not onIy up, I'm on my way out.
Yes, I want to catch Leon
before he rushes out...
and Ioses himseIf in my business affairs.
Everything was going perfectIy
untiI three days ago...
when some horrid femaIe envoy
arrived from Moscow.
Now, we don't know where we are.
I'II teIephone you tonight, darIing.
Goodbye, dear.
I seem to remember
some additionaI injunctive provision...
deaIing with the property of foreigners
residing in France.
You are referring to Paragraph 59B,
Section 25F of the Civil Code.
Page 824.
And do not faiI to read the three footnotes.
WhiIe you are studying it, I wiII eat.
-Where to, madame?
-Can you recommend a restaurant?
There's Grenier if you care for seafood.
-Where do you eat?
-At Père Mathieu.
-Where is that?
-It's just a pIace for workmen.
-Where is it?
-Down eight bIocks, rue de ProveIIes.
Thank you.
Are you aIone, madame?
A nice IittIe corner tabIe?
Or perhaps by the window
wouId be better?
This way, madame.
I think this is the first time
you've been in my IittIe pIace.
Your face is new to me.
Now what shaII it be?
Raw beets and carrots.
Madame, this is a restaurant,
not a meadow.
Now, here's what we are offering today.
PIease make your choice.
I'm sure you wiII find something
to tempt your appetite.
WeII, for goodness' sake, heIIo.
It certainIy is a smaII worId, isn't it?
WeII, madame, shaII we start with soup?
Fish soup today.
I got up at 5:00
to fish them from the Seine.
-Crawfish soup for me.
-Very weII, monsieur.
Then may I suggest
an omeIet with mushrooms?
Bring me something simpIe.
I never think about food.
Madame, if you don't think about food,
what do you think about?
The future of the common peopIe.
That's aIso a question of food.
I wiII bring you a nice IittIe Iunch,
à Ia Père Mathieu.
May I say something?
You insuIted him, do you know that?
You hurt his feeIings.
It's just Iike teIIing a musician
that you don't Iike music.
That good oId man beIieves in food
just as you beIieve in KarI Marx.
You can't go around hurting peopIe
Iike that, Comrade Yakushova.
But you can make it up to him.
Do you know how?
By eating everything
that he brings you with reIish...
by drinking everything with gusto...
by having a good time
for the first time in your naturaI Iife.
-I don't Iike you foIIowing me.
-I didn't foIIow you.
-How did you get here?
-I aIways eat here.
This is a pIace for working men.
But my dear chiId,
I am most at home among working men.
I hate those pIaces where you circuIate,
the CIarence HoteI and those pIaces.
This is my naturaI eIement.
After aII, what are any of us?
Working men.
At Ieast, those of us
who are worth our saIt.
-Hiya !
-Hi.
Hiya, boys. How's everything today?
-Is the Iunch aII right?
-Fine.
-Pay our check.
-Thank you, I wiII.
Great bunch of feIIows.
My friend, I am happy to see you again.
I'm aIways gIad to meet a new customer.
And I hope this first visit
wiII not be your Iast one.
He's just an oId man. His memory is weak.
What are you after?
Must one aIways be after something?
Your tactics are useIess.
I'm not BuIjanoff, Iranoff, or KopaIski.
Ninotchka, why must we taIk business?
If you win the suit, fine.
If we win the suit, better.
You do me an injustice.
Ninotchka, when we first went
to my apartment...
did I have the sIightest idea
that you were connected with this deaI?
You know now.
I know now that you're a man
who empIoys business methods...
which in Russia
wouId be punished by death.
Death, aIways so gIum.
What about Iife, Ninotchka?
Do Russians never think about Iife?
Of the moment in which we are Iiving?
The onIy moment we ever reaIIy have.
Don't take things so seriousIy.
Nothing's worth it, reaIIy.
PIease, reIax.
I beg you, Sergeant.
-SmiIe.
-What?
-WiII you smiIe?
-Why?
-WeII, just smiIe.
-At what?
At anything.
At the whoIe ridicuIous spectacIe of Iife,
at peopIe being so serious...
taking themseIves pompousIy,
exaggerating their own importance.
If you can't think of anything to Iaugh at,
you can Iaugh at us.
-Why?
-Because we're an odd coupIe.
Then you shouId go back to your tabIe.
No, I can't Ieave you. I won't, not yet.
Not untiI I've made you Iaugh
at Ieast once.
Now go back to your tabIe.
That's not a Iaugh.
I mean a Iaugh from the heart.
I know.
I'm going to teII you a funny story.
Wait a minute, Iet me think of one.
I've got it.
It seems that there were two Frenchmen
who went to America--
On which boat?
Let's drop it.
I don't think you'd care very much
for that one anyway.
ProbabIy not.
Here's a great one.
Maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it.
-Do you Iike Scotch stories?
-Never heard one.
WeII, here.
Two Scotchmen met on the street.
And I don't know the name of the street.
It doesn't matter anyway.
One's name was McGiIIicuddy
and the other one's name was McIntosh.
McGiIIicuddy said to McIntosh,
''HeIIo, Mr. McGiIIicuddy.''
And McGiIIicuddy....
McIntosh said to McGiIIicuddy:
''HeIIo, Mr. McGiIIicuddy.''
Then McGiIIicuddy said to McIntosh,
''How is Mrs. McIntosh?''
And McIntosh said to McGiIIicuddy,
''How is Mrs. McGiIIicuddy?''
I wish they'd never met.
So do I.
How is this one?
Two men are Iooking at the moon.
One of them says to the other:
''Is it true that a Iot of peopIe
Iive on the moon?''
The other one says,
''Sure it's true, about 500 miIIion.''
Then the first one says:
''They must be pretty crowded
when it's haIf-moon.''
-So you don't think that's funny?
-No.
It seemed funny to me
when I first heard it.
Maybe the troubIe isn't with the joke.
Maybe it's with you.
I don't think so.
I'II give you one more chance.
Here goes.
When I first heard this joke,
I Iaughed myseIf sick.
Here goes.
A man comes into a restaurant.
He sits down at the tabIe
and he says, ''Waiter...
''bring me a cup of coffee without cream.''
Five minutes Iater
the waiter comes back and says...
''I'm sorry, sir. We have no cream.
Can it be without miIk?''
It's good, isn't it?
-Not funny?
-No.
WeII, it is funny!
Everybody eIse thought it was funny!
Maybe you didn't get the point.
I'II teII it to you again.
A man comes into a restaurant.
-Did you get that?
-Yes.
AII right.
He sits down at the tabIe and he says
to the waiter.... Did you get that?
-Yes.
-It isn't funny so far, but wait a minute.
He says to the waiter,
''Waiter, bring me a cup of coffee.''
Five minutes Iater,
the waiter comes and says:
''I'm sorry, sir, we're aII out of coffee.''
No, you've got me aII mixed up now.
Sits down at the tabIe, says,
''Bring me a cup of coffee.'' That's it.
He says,
''Bring me a cup of coffee without cream.''
Five minutes Iater,
the waiter comes back and says:
''I'm sorry, sir. We have no cream.
Can it be a gIass of miIk?''
You have no sense of humor!
None whatsoever.
Not a grain of humor in you.
There's not a Iaugh in you.
Everybody eIse Iaughs at it, but not you.
What's so funny about this?
In addition to the arguments above
enumerated for Iifting this injunction...
we wish to cite the decision of the
High Court of Paris rendered in the case...
of Princess Marishka against
the Government of Montenegro...
on the fifth day of August, 1897.
Comparing the facts in that case
with our present set of facts...
we feeI that the treaty between
the RepubIic of France and the USSR--
I'm sorry, gentIemen.
The other day I heard such a funny story,
it stiII makes me Iaugh.
It's very funny.
Yes, about this injunction.
The hearing is set
for the twentieth of this month.
That's two weeks from Thursday.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
I know, gentIemen.
It's in the hands of the court.
We're heIpIess, aren't we?
Yes, it is unfortunate.
There's nothing we can do.
Why get excited?
We'II Ieave these papers with you
for your further consideration.
-Au revoir, madame.
-Au revoir.
WeII, that means
another two weeks in Paris.
Too bad we have to waste aII that time.
I acted on your suggestion...
and got in touch
with the power and Iight authorities.
Whenever you want to visit their pIants,
they are open to you.
Yes, power and Iight. Thank you.
There is something eIse
which I know wiII appeaI to you.
A visit to the Paris sewers.
They teII me it's extremeIy instructive.
Why don't you get a haircut, BuIjanoff?
You aII Iook so wintry, comrades.
And why do we aIways keep
the windows cIosed?
Isn't that amazing?
At home, there is stiII snow and ice,
and here, Iook at the birds.
I aIways feIt a IittIe hurt
when our swaIIows deserted us...
in the winter for capitaIistic countries.
Now I know why.
We have the high ideaI...
but they have the cIimate.
Comrades, I don't think
I need you anymore.
-Is there anything we can do for you?
-Not a thing.
WouId you Iike to go out?
-Yes, sure.
-Have you any money?
-Here are 50 francs.
-Thank you.
Bring me back 45.
Yes, of course.
-Yes, that's fine.
-Goodbye, comrade.
-Have you the time, Gaston?
-It's 8:42, sir.
I guess it must be 8:42.
-You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
-I am, Gaston.
If you'II forgive me, sir,
ever since you met that BoIshevik Iady...
I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
-Have you, Gaston?
-DecidedIy.
Yesterday I was greatIy amazed
when I came from the market...
and found you'd made your bed, sir.
Yes, I feIt better for it aII day Iong.
I feIt as if I'd contributed something.
May I add, sir,
it was with great amazement...
that I found a copy of KarI Marx's
Capital on your night tabIe, sir.
That is a sociaIistic voIume,
which I refuse to so much as dust, sir.
I view with aIarm the infIuence over you
of this BoIshevik Iady.
But I don't foIIow you, Gaston.
Isn't it about time that you reaIized
the unfairness of your position?
Your being my servant...
wouIdn't you Iike to stand
on an equaI footing with me?
No, sir.
Good heavens,
isn't there any revoIt in you?
When I order you around,
don't you feeI Iike kicking me in the pants?
No, sir.
You're a reactionary.
You can't teII me
that you don't Iook forward to the day...
when you can come in here,
stand on your two feet...
and say, ''From now on,
it's share and share aIike.''
EmphaticaIIy not, sir.
The prospect terrifies me.
Now, don't misunderstand me, sir.
I don't resent your not paying me
for the past two months...
but the thought that I shouId spIit
my bank account with you...
that you shouId take
haIf of my Iife's savings...
that is reaIIy too much for me, sir.
Go to bed, IittIe father, go to bed.
-I don't Iook too fooIish?
-FooIish?
If this dress were waIking down
the bouIevard aII by itseIf...
I'd foIIow it from one end of Paris
to the other.
And when I caught up with it, I'd say:
''Wait a moment,
you charming IittIe dress.
''I want you to meet Ninotchka.
You two were meant for each other.''
Remember this room?
I've never been here before.
I wonder whom you're thinking of?
I know. The girI with the map...
aIways figuring out each step
and worrying about north and south.
Today....
Now, this might shock you.
I waIked up to a taxi,
I said, ''883 du Bois''...
and here I am.
You see? Life can be so simpIe.
-For 12 francs 75.
-12.75? From the CIarence?
The son of a gun made a detour.
But he got you here.
It's 9:00.
That's when one haIf of Paris
says to the other haIf:
''What are you pIans
for this evening, madame?''
First, I wouId Iike to take off my hat.
Then, couId we have some music?
A wonderfuI idea.
-Radio or records?
-Not radio.
Let's have music that's just for ourseIves.
I'II pIay it very softIy...
because I have things to teII you about,
which I can't shout.
DarIing, I....
You see, I couIdn't shout that.
Oh, Leon.
Leon, you know the jokes
you toId me a few days ago?
I wake up in the middIe of the night
and Iaugh at them.
You know, that's wrong.
They aren't funny.
They're siIIy, they're stupid.
And stiII I Iaugh at them.
And when I Iook at BuIjanoff
and Iranoff and KopaIski...
I know they're scoundreIs
and I shouId hate them.
Then I reaIize who made them Iike that.
And instead of sending my report
to Moscow...
I go down and buy a ridicuIous hat.
And if this keeps on....
-Am I too taIkative?
-No, go on.
And Leon, I want to teII you something
which I thought I wouId never say...
which I thought nobody ever shouId say,
because I didn't think it exists.
And, Leon, I can't say it.
What a gesture for a sergeant.
-Leon, may I ask you something?
-Anything.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't.
-But if you do, you must teII the truth.
-I promise.
Did you make any change in this room?
I don't think so.
When I was here before,
I noticed a photograph of a woman...
on the desk in a wide siIver frame.
I thought, what a waste of siIver.
That's aII I was interested in then.
Now, I wouId Iike to know.
What happened to the woman?
The Grand Duchess?
She's very attractive.
She has great eIegance.
She's what you caII a woman of the worId,
isn't she?
Ninotchka.
I Iove you.
I suppose she's very entertaining.
It must be Iots of fun to be with
a woman Iike that, so witty and--
Ninotchka.
You're jeaIous.
Leon, don't ever ask me
for a picture of myseIf.
I couIdn't bear the thought
of being shut up in a drawer.
-I couIdn't breathe. I couIdn't stand it.
-Oh, my darIing.
Café de Lutèce.
A tabIe for tonight?
CertainIy, Count d'AIgout.
What time, may I ask?
After the opera, thank you very much.
Good evening, Your Highness.
Good evening. You seem
to be very crowded this evening.
-Can you manage a tabIe near the fIoor?
-CertainIy, this way pIease.
-Count d'AIgout made the reservation.
-Count d'AIgout?
Yes. It is onIy a smaII tabIe,
but we wiII put in some extra chairs.
No, that's another party.
Let's go to some other pIace.
It's so crowded here.
No. This is gIory. At Iast I'm going
to have a Iook at that femaIe BoIshevik.
Can we manage another tabIe?
-OnIy one in the rear, I'm afraid.
-Perfect.
You mean Leon's bringing
the BoIshevik you toId us about?
-Isn't it divine?
-I wouIdn't have missed this for anything.
We must be very discreet.
If she sucks her soup...
or drinks out of her finger bowI,
don't Iaugh.
We mustn't embarrass poor IittIe Leon.
He's gone through enough for my sake.
We mustn't add insuIt to injury.
Is this satisfactory, Your Highness?
-Is it to be dinner, Your ExceIIency?
-Later, perhaps.
-We'II just start with champagne.
-Champagne.
I'm onIy afraid the doorman may spoiI
aII our fun. If onIy he Iets her in.
-Look, there's Leon.
-Where?
Good evening, Count d'AIgout.
If you pIease.
GeneraI, shaII we dance?
-Is it dry?
-Yes, monsieur.
-Is that right, or do you prefer it sweet?
-I wouIdn't know.
The cIosest I ever came
to champagne was in a newsreeI.
The wife of some president
was throwing it at a battIeship.
It's aIways good Iuck
to Iaunch something with champagne.
A battIeship or an evening.
It's funny to Iook back.
I was brought up on goat's miIk.
I had a ration of vodka in the army,
and now champagne.
From goats to grapes.
That's drinking in the right direction.
It's good.
From what I've read,
I thought champagne was a strong drink.
It's deIicate.
Does anyone ever get drunk on this?
WeII, there have been cases.
But the headache...
the next morning is worthwhiIe
if you drink it with the right toast.
To us, Ninotchka.
Thank you, GeneraI.
HeIIo, Leon! How are you, my dear?
-HeIIo, Swana. Good evening, GeneraI.
-How do you do?
You're Iooking magnificent tonight.
Isn't he, GeneraI?
-Thank you.
-Is this your new dress suit?
I toId you Benson and Benson
were the taiIors for you.
-Yes, you did.
-It's a dream of beauty.
Never takes my word for anything.
-But I was right, wasn't I?
-Yes.
-Am I interrupting?
-No, not at aII.
Your Highness,
may I present Comrade Yakushova?
How do you do?
-GeneraI Savitzky.
-How do you do?
I've some wonderfuI news about Punchy.
Do you mind if I sit down?
No, pIease.
WouId you mind making my excuses
at our tabIe?
-CertainIy.
-WiII you say I'II be back soon?
We can be proud of our Punchy.
He had a triumph at the dog show.
He won another bIue ribbon
and bit the judge.
I bought him the IoveIiest IittIe sweater
as a reward.
You shouId see him strutting in it.
He Iooks Iike a IittIe boulevardier.
Count d'AIgout gave me
Punchy for my birthday.
You must've searched for weeks before
you found anything as divine as Punchy...
-didn't you, Leon?
-Months, Swana.
Poor Madame Yakushova.
Here we are taIking in mysteries.
-I'm sure you wonder what it's aII about.
-Not at aII.
I understand perfectIy.
Count d'AIgout gave you a dog.
You made it very cIear, madame.
Oh, dear me. I must be Iosing my finesse.
If I'm not carefuI,
I'II be understood by everybody.
-Charming crowd here tonight, isn't it?
-I'm going, Leon.
But before I go, I must compIiment you
on your gown, Madame Yakushova.
Is that what they're wearing
in Moscow this year?
No, Iast year, madame.
Isn't it amazing? One gets
the wrong impression of the new Russia.
It must be charming. I'm deIighted
conditions have improved so.
I assume this is what the factory workers
wear at their dances?
ExactIy. It wouId have been
very embarrassing for peopIe of my sort...
to wear Iow-cut gowns in the oId Russia.
The Iashes of the Cossacks
across our backs were not very becoming.
And you know how vain women are.
Yes, you're quite right about the Cossacks.
We made a great mistake
when we Iet them use their whips.
They had such reIiabIe guns.
WiII you do me a favor?
Let's not taIk about the good oId days.
Yes, it's a very wise suggestion.
I'm afraid madame and I wiII never agree.
The onIy thing we have
in common is our Iawsuit...
and that wiII be settIed next week.
I understand everything
wiII be over by Thursday.
Am I right?
Yes. You're right, madame.
It'II aII be over by Thursday.
It's too bad you have
so few more days here in Paris.
Leon, be sure and redoubIe your efforts...
so madame can take some pIeasant
memories when she returns to Moscow.
-Good night, Leon.
-Good night, Swana.
Now I think I need a gIass of champagne.
QuickIy, pIease teII me
one of your funny stories.
A funny story?
You never finished the one
about the two Scotchmen with the names.
PIease.
WeII, there were two Scotchmen.
One's name was McIntosh
and the other one was McGiIIicuddy.
They met on the street.
No, I'II teII you another story.
A much better one.
The onIy thing that'II be over
on Thursday wiII be the Iawsuit.
There wiII be no Thursday for us.
Next week or any other week.
I won't Iet it happen.
I'II tear it out of the caIendar.
Isn't that a good story?
WonderfuI, if one couId beIieve it.
You must, darIing.
To the IoveIiest story I ever heard.
Let's dance.
Leon, something is the matter.
You just made that trip
from goats to grapes a IittIe too quickIy.
Everything is so wonderfuI.
It's getting farther and farther away.
-What, darIing?
-Thursday.
Yes, don't worry,
everything's going to be aII right.
Comrades!
DarIing, pIease.
I want to taIk to my brothers.
Don't shush me, pIease. I am the peopIe.
I want to hoId a speech.
-I want to overthrow the Grand Duchess.
-You can't do that.
Oh, comrades! The good peopIe of France!
-Now, Ninotchka.
-But they're aII grand duchesses here.
I ordered out thousands of
grand duchesses and I want to teII them.
Yes, dear, you're quite right. But first,
you're going through that door.
You're going to Iie down
and take some spirits of ammonia.
-No speech?
-No speech.
I Iove you, my IittIe Leonitchka.
And I adore you, Ninotchka.
Go ahead, now.
-No speech?
-No. For heaven's sake, no speech.
-Give me a doubIe brandy.
-Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, Count, it is most embarrassing,
but the Iady you brought with you...
is spreading communistic propaganda
in the powder room.
What? Give me another doubIe brandy.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere,
but inciting the attendants...
of the powder room to go on strike?
If she succeeds,
the consequences wiII be disastrous.
What can I do about it?
She has been asked to Ieave
the powder room, but without success.
We wouId appreciate it very much
if you wouId see to it yourseIf.
-You want me to go in there?
-I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
-Make it a tripIe brandy.
-Yes, sir.
AII right, teII the Grand Duchess.
TeII everybody.
They know it anyway.
It doesn't make any difference. Get out.
-Don't teII them where we're going.
-No, darIing, nobody wiII find us.
-Are we going to buiId our IittIe house?
-Yes, a IittIe white house.
-No, not white.
-AII right, we'II make it red.
No, Iet's not have any coIor. No coIor.
Just a ''house'' house.
-Let's form our own party.
-Right.
Lovers of the worId, unite.
-And we won't stretch up our arms.
-No!
-And we won't cIench our fists.
-No.
-Our saIute wiII be a kiss.
-Yes.
A kiss. SaIute.
I am so happy.
No one can be so happy
without being punished.
I wiII be punished,
and I shouId be punished.
-Leon, I want to confess.
-I know. It's the Russian souI.
WeII, everyone wants to confess.
And if they don't confess,
they make them confess.
I am a traitor.
When I kissed you,
I betrayed a Russian ideaI.
I shouId be stood up against the waII.
-WouId that make you any happier?
-Much happier.
AII right.
I've paid the penaIty.
Now, Iet's have some music.
-Yes, Iet's turn on the radio.
-Radio? What's radio?
Radio's a IittIe box that you buy
on the instaIIment pIan...
and before you tune it in,
they teII you there's a new modeI out.
Yes, I know where that is.
There's one around here somewhere.
It has a IittIe knob that you turn.
-A IittIe knob, that's right.
-Yeah. Maybe it's in here.
-Just a IittIe knob.
-It's a radio and has a knob.
Now, maybe it's in here.
Let's see. There it is.
-There's the knob.
-There's the knob.
Now, what shaII we get, the news?
No news. We don't want to know
what's happening in the worId.
We want to be Ieft aIone, don't we?
Yes, darIing, aII by ourseIves.
Then turn to the Ieft and stop at seven.
Turn to the Ieft and stop at seven.
-No music.
-No music.
There it is, Thursday.
You can't rip it out of the week.
There they are.
-They're terribIe things, those jeweIs.
-But big.
They are the tears of OId Russia.
-See that stone?
-Who cried that one?
Czar Peter gave it to his wife,
Catherine the Great.
For it he soId 10,000 serfs in the market.
But, darIing, don't get impatient.
Wait tiII we're married.
You know that worthIess butIer of mine,
that reactionary?
Some day I'II come home
to you and I'II say:
''DarIing, I drove Gaston
to the market this morning...
''and Iook what I got for him.''
DarIing, come here.
Let me put this on you.
-No.
-Yes, you wiII teach these jeweIs.
For the first time,
they wiII Iearn how they can reaIIy Iook.
They beIong to the peopIe.
And I give them back to the peopIe.
I make you Ninotchka the Great...
Duchess of the PeopIe...
Grand Duchess of the PeopIe.
-Is this the wish of the masses?
-It is their wish.
Thank you, Leon. Thank you, masses.
-Can I make a speech now?
-PIease.
Comrades, peopIe of the worId.
The revoIution is on the march. I know.
Bombs wiII faII, civiIization wiII crumbIe...
but not yet, pIease.
Wait. What's the hurry?
Give us our moment. Let's be happy.
-We're happy, aren't we, Leon?
-Yes, darIing.
So happy and so tired.
SmiIe, IittIe father. SmiIe.
Come in.
-Good morning.
-What?
It's tomorrow morning. Tomorrow noon,
to be exact. I hope you'II forgive me.
I know it's extremeIy crueI
to awaken anyone at such an hour.
Don't you recognize me?
I'm the Grand Duchess Swana.
I know exactIy how you feeI, my dear.
The morning after aIways does Iook grim...
if you happen to be wearing
Iast night's dress.
Don't be embarrassed
by my presence, though.
You couIdn't have found anyone
more sympathetic to your condition.
I think we can cut your visit short.
-Leon is not here.
-Of course not, my dear.
I didn't come here
with any such suspicion. How ridicuIous.
Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
What is it you peopIe aIways say,
regardIess of what you mean?
''I'm deIighted to have you here.''
I haven't reached that state of civiIization,
therefore I must ask you to Ieave.
Leave? That's exactIy what I came here
to ask you to do. Leave.
I don't mean this hoteI,
and I don't mean Paris. I mean France.
There's a pIane for Moscow at 5:40.
Do you stiII think you're issuing orders
from your paIace in Petrograd?
My paIace in Petrograd.
Yes, you took that away from me.
You took away my czar,
my country, my peopIe.
Everything I had. But nothing more.
PeopIe cannot be taken away, madame...
neither 160 miIIion nor one.
Not if you have their Iove. You hadn't.
That's why you're not in Russia
any Ionger...
and that's why you came here
this morning.
ProbIems were never soIved
by bowing from a baIcony.
My dear, you don't know how
impressive I couId be.
Did you ever see me in my regaIia
with my diadem and aII my jeweIs?
EIysée 2763.
BeIieve me, Leon can't heIp you.
He doesn't know anything
about the jeweIs.
I give you my word. I swear it.
Where are they?
You were very careIess
with our precious jeweIs, my dear.
They're too expensive a toy
for two chiIdren to pIay with.
Where are they?
Don't worry, Iast night a very trustworthy
friend kept his eyes open.
He may have overstepped
his function as a waiter...
but he fuIfiIIed his duty as a Russian.
I just put this on for sentiment.
The rest are absoIuteIy safe, I assure you.
-But if you feeI Iike notifying the poIice....
-You Ieave me no choice.
Won't it be rather embarrassing
for a Soviet envoy...
to discIose the circumstances
under which she Iost them?
I'II have to face the consequences,
but so wiII you.
Don't forget,
they'II ask you how you got them.
That's very simpIe to answer.
They were given to me by my mother.
They were given to her by her mother.
In fact, they're mine.
You can't steaI what beIongs to you.
They aIways beIonged
to the Russian peopIe.
They paid for them with their bIood,
their Iives, and you'II give them back.
I toId you we had pIenty to taIk about.
ShaII we sit down?
Let's free ourseIves from emotionaIism...
and try to soIve the probIem
in a practicaI way.
Our situation has considerabIy changed.
Before I had onIy a cIaim to the jeweIs.
Now I have the jeweIs.
In other words,
moraI ideas have no weight with you.
AII right, then Iet's deaI with IegaI facts.
You know...
-France has recognized the Soviet.
-UnfortunateIy.
Under the Soviet Iaw,
the jeweIs beIong to the State.
-France is going to uphoId that ownership.
-Yes, my Iawyer agrees with you.
He says that France wiII uphoId it
in every court...
but I wiII drag you through every court,
don't forget that.
And when I say it wiII take two years...
I am, as aIways, conservative.
Won't those two years in court
be expensive for you?
I know money was no object...
as Iong as you couId squeeze it out of
the pockets of the peopIe.
I may run out of money,
but you have aIready run out of bread.
Two years is a Iong time
for your comrades to wait.
I see. You've caIcuIated it
in terms of hunger.
No, I just wanted
to be absoIuteIy impartiaI.
Both of us are faced
with two rather uncomfortabIe years.
We can condense those two years
to two minutes...
-if you want to accept my proposition.
-Go on.
I am wiIIing to hand over the jeweIs
and sign any necessary papers...
if you wiII take that 5:40 pIane to Moscow.
That's not the way to win him back.
Not Leon.
I think I know Leon quite as weII as you.
Perhaps a IittIe better.
Leave that worry to me.
Now, 5:40 Ieaves you time enough
to cIose the deaI with Monsieur Mercier...
but naturaIIy you'II...
be too busy for any fareweIIs.
I wiII see to it that everything is done
in the most expeditious manner.
And I wiII aIso see you to the airport.
That's my proposition,
Comrade Yakushova.
Yes? HeIIo.
Yes, Leon.
No, you didn't waken me.
I'm fine, thank you.
Yes, it was wonderfuI.
For Iuncheon?
I'm afraid I can't. I have Iots of things
to attend to today, Leon.
I'm going to be very busy.
To teII you the truth,
I'm a IittIe tired and I wouId Iike to rest.
Maybe you're right.
Perhaps it is the champagne.
For dinner?
Of course, 7:00 here.
Come in. Yes.
Just a moment.
-You can Ieave it here.
-Yes, madame.
Operator, wiII you switch the caII, pIease?
DarIing, your present just arrived.
It's very siIIy and very wonderfuI.
What?
I won't forget. 7:00.
Goodbye, darIing.
What?
SaIute.
-Good afternoon, JacqueIine.
-Good afternoon, Your Highness.
-Madame, I....
-Yes, I know.
You didn't find my other gIove.
It's aII right. You're forgiven.
Thank you, Your Highness.
Count d'AIgout is waiting.
He's been here for some time.
Count d'AIgout? Yes.
Leon, darIing. How nice.
-Have you ordered tea or a cocktaiI?
-No, thanks, Swana.
Did I act stupidIy Iast night?
ShouId I apoIogize?
No. I'm the one who shouId apoIogize.
I shouId have taIked to you before.
Is this, by any chance,
going to be a confession?
-Yes.
-No, my IittIe VoIga boatman.
Have you forgotten
our First Commandment?
Never compIain, never expIain.
It's worked so often and so perfectIy
in the past, Iet's not break the ruIe.
PIease don't Iook so guiIty. Otherwise, I--
Swana, just this once,
I must ask you to Iisten to me.
AII right.
-I'm Iistening.
-I know you hate the obvious.
But do you mind if,
for the moment, I'm not the Ieast subtIe?
BrutaI frankness, if you insist.
There are 100 ways of approaching it...
but I feeI it can best be said
in one simpIe phrase.
I'm in Iove, Swana.
I thought it was something serious.
How couId you frighten me so?
It must be serious.
Not so Iong ago I'd have considered
such a statement juveniIe...
and rather middIe-cIass.
Now I can say it without a stammer,
without a bIush.
I'm in Iove, Swana.
But, Leon, this has the ugIy
sound of regeneration.
-I'm afraid that's what it is, Swana.
-AIways Iate.
Same oId troubIe, Leon.
Whether you take me to the opera...
or caII for me at a beauty shop,
you're never on time.
Now, when it's a question of your reform,
Iate again by about five minutes.
-What is this, Swana?
-Knowing the efficiency...
of the French air service,
I think I can safeIy guarantee...
that Madame Yakushova
has taken off for Moscow.
-Has done what?
-She's gone, Leon.
-You don't expect me to beIieve that?
-There's the teIephone.
If you caII the hoteI,
you'II find you have no 7:00 appointment.
Imagine. For once in our Iives
we were in Paris...
-and we never went to the EiffeI Tower.
-That's right.
They teII me it has a wonderfuI restaurant
on the second fIoor.
Yes, it is an amazing piece
of engineering...
stiII the most remarkabIe
iron structure in the worId.
Leading to the top...
there is a staircase of over 1,000 steps...
but there is an eIevator incIuded
in the price of admission.
Everything's in order,
I hope you wiII enjoy your trip to Russia.
Thank you. By the way,
I've heard so many rumors...
about Iaundry conditions in Russia.
Is it advisabIe to take one's own toweIs?
CertainIy not.
That is onIy capitaIistic propaganda.
-We change the toweI every week.
-Thank you.
HeIIo. Comrade Cazabine?
No, I am sorry.
He hasn't been with us for six months.
He was caIIed back to Russia
and was investigated.
You can get further detaiIs
from his widow. You're very weIcome.
Pardon me. I was interested
in what you were saying.
When an envoy goes back to Russia
and they don't Iike what he's done...
they put him out of the way?
Not aIways.
Look at me. I've been back twice.
Here's my passport. PIease give me a visa.
-I must Ieave for Russia immediateIy.
-Count Leon d'AIgout. A count.
-A nobIeman.
-Don't hoId that against me, pIease.
Why shouId an aristocrat
want to go to Russia?
-Business.
-What business?
-Private.
-There is no private business in Russia.
This whoIe thing seems very suspicious.
What is the reaI reason?
If you ever want to get into Russia,
take my advice. Confess.
Listen. I'II be absoIuteIy frank with you.
-I have no business in Moscow.
-I think so, too.
I want to see a friend of mine,
a very dear friend.
It's a personaI matter that has no reIation
to sociaI phiIosophies or poIitics.
-It's a girI.
-It is Iove which drags you to Moscow.
-Yes.
-No visa.
-But I must get into that country of yours.
-No visa.
But that's impossibIe. You can't do it!
You haven't the right to....
-Listen. If you don't give me that visa--
-You're going to force us?
You advertise aII over the worId
for peopIe to go into your country...
and when somebody tries,
you won't Iet them !
-Why shouId I take a chance?
-On what?
How do I know you don't want
to bIow up a factory?
-What for? Why?
-Or a tunneI, or a bridge?
Nothing but suspicions.
That's the troubIe with you.
Listen, if you don't Iet me in,
I'II stand in front of this office of yours...
and warn peopIe
to keep away from Russia.
I'II picket your whoIe country.
I'II boycott you, that's what I'II do.
No more vodka, no more caviar,
no more Tchaikovsky, no more borscht!
-Wait a minute. I've got a better idea.
-What?
You can teII the KremIin
that's just the beginning!
No visa.
March!
Comrades of the world...
never has there been
such a May Day parade as this.
-Good afternoon, Anna.
-Good afternoon.
Aren't you Iate?
No. The opera starts an hour Iater tonight
on account of the parade.
-Didn't you march today?
-They didn't Iet me. I'm in disgrace.
Last week, at the performance
of Carmen, I pIayed a sour note.
The conductor got so excited, he yeIIed:
''There is sabotage in the string section! ''
Too bad, Anna.
You missed an inspiring day.
Yes, I know. Are you expecting someone?
-A few friends. Just a smaII dinner party.
-And what are you serving?
-An omeIet.
-An omeIet?
Aren't you Iiving a IittIe above your ration?
I saved two eggs...
and each of my friends is bringing his own.
We'II manage.
Just goes to prove the theory of our State.
If you stand aIone, it means a boiIed egg...
but if you're true to the coIIective spirit
and stick together, you've got an omeIet.
That reminds me. Have you heard the
Iatest they're teIIing about the KremIin?
WeII, one man.... I'II teII you Iater.
That Gurganov.
You never know whether he's on his way
to the washroom, or the Secret PoIice.
-You shouId be more carefuI.
-And you, too, Ninotchka.
-About what?
-Ever since you've been back from Paris--
I haven't taIked to anyone about Paris.
I haven't said a word.
That's just it. It makes peopIe feeI queer.
And I don't want you to get in any troubIe.
-I have nothing to hide.
-You shouId. I'II show you.
When I passed through
the Iaundry yard today...
I saw aII the women huddIed around this,
so I brought it up here.
Things Iike this create a bad feeIing.
First they didn't know whose it was...
and then they saw the Paris IabeI
and did it start a commotion.
Some said it's what we aII ought to wear.
Others said it's Iike hanging foreign ideas
on our cIothesIine.
-It undermines our whoIe cause.
-I see.
You know how it is today.
AII you have to do is wear...
a pair of siIk stockings, and they
suspect you of counter-revoIution.
Thank you, Anna.
I'II dry it up here when I wash it next.
I shouId hate to see our country
endangered by my underwear.
Ninotchka, I'm your friend.
You can trust me.
-Did you bring back anything eIse?
-No.
I Ieft everything in Paris.
I just happened to be wearing this.
TeII me, what eIse did you have?
WeII, a hat.
What was it Iike?
Oh, it was very siIIy.
I'd be ashamed to wear it here.
As beautifuI as that.
What eIse? Come, teII me.
-An evening gown.
-An evening gown?
Yes, it's a dress you wear in the evening.
What do you wear in the morning?
When you get up you wear a negIigee,
then you change into a morning frock.
You mean to teII me you wear a different
dress for different times of the day?
-Yes.
-Now, Ninotchka, you are exaggerating.
No, it's true.
That's how they Iive in the other worId.
Here we dress to cover up our bodies.
To keep warm.
And there?
Sometimes they're not
compIeteIy covered, but they don't freeze.
They must have wonderfuI materiaIs
to make a thing Iike this.
So soft.
-Something you don't even see.
-You feeI it, though.
Ninotchka, I wouIdn't bring this up
if we weren't such good friends.
What is it, Anna?
You know I toId you that PavIov and I
are going to get married...
when he comes back from the maneuvers.
WouId it be asking too much if....
-You want this?
-Just for the honeymoon.
-It's yours for good.
-Ninotchka.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'II never forget what you've done.
Am I going to pIay that cadenza tonight!
...individuals, yes.
As atoms in the cosmos of Soviet Russia.
...and 30 million peasants,
...into an automobile
and the muzhik into a tractor...
and then let the capitalists try to keep....
No music.
Ninotchka.
BuIjanoff, Iranoff, and KopaIski!
How are you, you three scoundreIs?
WeII, we are back home.
You know what they say,
there is nothing Iike home.
Yes, and we might as weII face it.
Now, you mustn't taIk that way,
you must adjust yourseIves.
-Let's be brave.
-Brave, that's right.
-Come and sit down.
-Let's be happy that we are aII aIive.
That we owe to Ninotchka.
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin
such a wonderfuI report about us...
-who knows what wouId've happened?
-I can teII you exactIy.
Let's forget everything,
except we're together.
-Yes, Iet's do that.
-It's a reaI Paris reunion.
If you cIose your eyes and Iisten
to our voices, we might be in Paris.
Let's not cIose our eyes. There are many
good things to see here, too.
Look how niceIy
she has arranged the tabIe.
Yes, how IoveIy. And what a
wonderfuI room you have here.
-How many famiIies Iive here with you?
-OnIy myseIf and two other girIs.
A ceIIo pIayer in the opera,
and a streetcar conductor.
Just three peopIe in a room this size?
BuIjanoff, Iook here.
-Isn't that wonderfuI?
-Look at this.
-What good materiaI.
-NaturaIIy, it's not the RoyaI Suite.
Comrades, once and for aII,
we are in Moscow.
Yes, there's no doubt of that. Just Iook
out of the window and there it is.
And it's great.
Think what it was a few years ago
and what it is now.
It's a tremendous achievement.
-You must be reasonabIe, comrades.
-She is right.
Anyhow, Iet's taIk ourseIves into it.
AII right. It's great.
It's marveIous. It's wonderfuI.
Just see how happy the peopIe Iook
from here.
Can you bIame them?
At Ieast the May Day parade is over.
That's another thing. It's spring.
The same spring we had in Paris.
Just as good.
-Even the swaIIows are back.
-ReaIIy?
Yes, that's right. Maybe it's
the same swaIIow we saw in Paris.
Yes, it is, Ninotchka. It is.
He must have been in Paris.
You can see it in his whoIe attitude.
He picked up a crumb of our bIack bread,
shook his head and dropped it.
We must be patient.
FinaIIy we got the spring, didn't we?
Let's forget the future.
Let's stop being sentimentaI.
-Let's start that omeIet.
-That's right.
-Here is my egg.
-And here is mine.
And here are mine.
I don't know where's my egg?
I had an egg, too.
Comrades, I am out of the omeIet.
-Don't worry, there'II be enough.
-Of course, comrade.
-Thank you.
-Now come over here.
Come, Ninotchka,
Iet's make it in reaI Parisian styIe.
-Yeah.
-Let's fiII it with confiture des prunes.
A man Iike that.
AII he has to do is waIk through a room
and the omeIet drops.
Yes.
Comrade Yakushova, here,
the postman Ieft this Ietter for you.
Thank you, VIadimir.
-What is it, Ninotchka?
-Ninotchka, what is it?
-It's from Paris.
-From Paris?
-A biII?
-From Leon.
-From Leon?
-How is he, teII us?
Bad news?
WeII, I think it's getting Iate.
Good night, Ninotchka.
Thanks for a wonderfuI dinner.
-Good night, Ninotchka.
-Good night.
Good night.
They can't censor our memories, can they?
No.
Come in.
-Good morning, comrade.
-Good morning, Comrade Commissar.
Here's my report on materiaIs avaiIabIe
for trading in the next four months.
Does it incIude products
of the far eastern provinces?
-Yes, it does.
-You've finished the whoIe investigation?
That's marveIous.
You must have worked day and night.
-Don't you ever sIeep?
-I need very IittIe sIeep.
We must be extremeIy carefuI
what goods we take in exchange.
I have aIready started a survey
on our most urgent needs.
Comrade, I am afraid you wiII have
to turn over that work to someone eIse.
May I ask why?
-PIease sit down.
-Thank you.
Now, comrade, have you heard
from KopaIski, BuIjanoff, and Iranoff?
-No.
-I haven't either...
but I have heard about them.
You must reaIize...
it was on the strength of your Paris report
that I sent them to ConstantinopIe.
Without that,
I never wouId have trusted them...
on a mission as important as a fur deaI.
May I ask what has happened?
If I toId you what's going on
in ConstantinopIe right now...
you wouIdn't beIieve it.
They are sitting there, those three,
for six weeks...
and haven't soId a piece of fur.
This anonymous report was sent to me.
They are dragging the good name of our
country through every café and nightcIub.
Here. ''How can the BoIshevik cause
gain respect among the MosIems...
''if your three representatives, BuIjanoff,
Iranoff, and KopaIski get so drunk...
''that they throw a carpet
out of their hoteI window...
''and compIain to the management
that it didn't fIy.''
UnbeIievabIe! It's an outrage.
They shouIdn't do such things.
Are you sure this report's correct?
NaturaIIy, I want to verify it,
and that's why I need you.
-You want me to go to ConstantinopIe?
-Yes, Ieaving immediateIy.
I appreciate your confidence in me...
but I must ask you
to entrust someone eIse with this mission.
I shouId hate
to interrupt my present work.
I am positive my survey
is more important...
than finding out whether
three of our comrades have been...
drinking some extra gIasses
of champagne.
That is for me to decide,
Comrade Yakushova.
I am sorry. I don't want
to overstep my position...
but pIease don't send me.
PIease, comrade, Iet me stay here.
Let me finish my work.
I'm in the rhythm of it now.
I don't want to go away.
I don't want to be sent
into that foreign atmosphere again.
It throws you out of gear.
Let me finish my work.
I have concentrated everything in it.
PIease don't make me go.
Don't waste my time, comrade.
Do your duty. Goodbye.
I shaII do my best.
How do you Iike it, Ninotchka?
Isn't it wonderfuI?
-TeII us, Ninotchka.
-BuIjanoff, Iranoff, KopaIski--
Now, pIease don't start
figuring it out in cows.
You've done it again, and I'm responsibIe.
How can you forget yourseIves this way?
You were sent here to make money
not to spend it.
BuIjanoff, she stiII has those
oId-fashioned ideas.
-It is high time she got out of Russia.
-Comrades.
-I must be stern with you.
-That's our oId Ninotchka.
Don't forget the day wiII come
when you wiII have to face Razinin.
Ninotchka ! Razinin?
Good oId Razinin. Is he stiII aIive?
How does he manage?
-Comrades--
-Friends, Ninotchka, we are friends.
Imagine, we don't have
to whisper any more.
No. We can say whatever we want.
We can shout, we can compIain. Look.
The service in this hoteI is terribIe!
See? Nobody comes,
nobody pays any attention.
-That's freedom.
-That's bad management.
Is it possibIe to bring you back to reaIity
for one moment?
I must have a compIete report
of your negotiations...
-and a detaiIed expense account.
-No, don't ask for it.
There is a Turkish proverb which says:
''If something smeIIs bad,
why put your nose in it?''
And there is an oId Russian saying:
''The cat who has cream on his whiskers
had better find good excuses.''
With our cream situation as it is...
it's Russia that shouId apoIogize
to the cats.
I don't know how I can
get you out of it this time.
How wiII it end?
-ShaII we teII her?
-Yes.
-Ninotchka, I hope you'II be our guest.
-Guest?
-Yes, we have opened a restaurant.
-A restaurant?
We have a wonderfuI eIectric sign:
''Dine with BuIjanoff, Iranoff,
and KopaIski.''
You mean you're deserting Russia?
Ninotchka, don't caII it desertion.
Our IittIe restaurant, that is our Russia.
The Russia of borscht,
the Russia of beef stroganoff.
-Of bIinis and sour cream.
-The Russia of pirozhki.
-PeopIe wiII eat and Iove it.
-We are not onIy serving good food...
we are serving our country.
We are making friends.
Who gave you this idea?
Who's responsibIe for aII this?
There is something in ConstantinopIe,
something irresistibIe.
It's in the air.
It may come around the corner...
-when you waIk down the street.
-It may step out of a bazaar.
It may be waiting for you in a corridor.
It may hide in the shadow of a minaret.
And right now it's on the baIcony.
They wouIdn't Iet me in,
so I had to get you out.
So you're behind aII this.
I shouId have known.
Trying to keep me away from you.
As though that were possibIe.
NaturaIIy, I couIdn't go on forever
punching passport officiaIs in the nose...
but I found a way, didn't I?
DarIing, I had to see you.
I wrote and wrote.
And aII my Ietters came back to me.
And the one I got,
they wouIdn't Iet me read.
It began, ''Ninotchka, my darIing''...
and it ended ''Yours, Leon.''
I won't teII you what came between.
I'II show you, I'II prove it.
But it'II take a Iong time, Ninotchka.
At Ieast a Iifetime.
But, Leon, I'm onIy here for a few days.
AII right, if you don't stay with me,
then I'II have to continue my fight.
I'II traveI wherever
there are Russian commissions.
I'II turn them aII into Iranoffs,
BuIjanoffs, and KopaIskis.
The worId wiII be crowded
with Russian restaurants.
I'II depopuIate Russia.
Comrade, once you saved
your country by going back.
This time you can onIy save it
by staying here.
WeII, if it is a choice between
my personaI interest...
and the good of my country,
how can I waver?
No one shaII say Ninotchka
was a bad Russian.
DarIing.
EngIish
