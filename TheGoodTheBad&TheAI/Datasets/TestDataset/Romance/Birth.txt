Okay... let me say this.
Let me say this.
If I lost my wife and, uh,
the next day, a little bird
landed on my windowsill,
looked me right in the eye,
and in plain English said,
"Sean, it's me, Anna. I'm back,"...
What could I say?
I guess I'd believe her. Or I'd want to.
I'd be stuck with a bird.
But other than that, no.
I'm a man of science.
I just don't believe that mumbo-jumbo.
Now, that's gonna have
to be the last question.
I need to go running
before I head home.
Okay.
Oh. Excuse me.
I forgot the ribbon.
Come on.
I don't want to go up alone.
I'll be a minute.
Hi, I--
I met Anna at a party.
And I called her to see if she'd
go out with me, but she said no.
But I kept calling.
It took one year
to get her to have dinner with me.
A year after that,
I asked her to marry me.
She said no.
A year later, I asked her again
and she still said no.
Two weeks ago...
she said "Maybe."
Tonight I stand before you
with a "Yes."
Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
I left, uh, the ribbon
in the car.
I'll be up in a minute.
Hi.
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks.
Would you like me to wrap it?
Make it look pretty.
Anna.
Clifford.
It's been a long time.
This is a good thing.
Congratulations.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Joseph.
- This is--
- Clifford.
Congratulations.
Nice speech.
I've heard a lot about you.
Clara's here.
She forgot a ribbon.
- Oh.
- For your present.
So I better go and wait for her.
Enjoy the festivities.
I will. We will.
Thank you.
I liked what you said.
Sean!
Sean!
One minute!
I'm coming!
Let's eat this thing.
Bob, would you carve?
Sure.
Are the Drummonds here?
Where are the Drummonds?
They called. They said
they're gonna be late.
That they'd be here
for the cake.
Fine.
Anna's made a decision.
Oh.
You've picked a date?
- The merry month of May.
- Fantastic.
- Joe, congratulations.
- Thank you, Bob.
I wanted to tell her.
It's my wedding.
Can't I be excited?
May's a great month.
Nice and warm.
- Well done, Joseph.
- Thank you.
Hi.
Are you coming
to Eleanor's party?
No. I want to see Anna.
I used to take lessons
and then I stopped.
I--I wish I hadn't.
We're gonna do the cake.
Sorry we're late.
In the dining room.
Thank you.
Here we are.
Can you get the knife for her?
Look at that.
No, I don't believe it.
Nice work.
Make a wish, Eleanor.
Laura and Anna
on each side of me.
Happy birthday, Mother.
Happy birthday, Mom.
I'm here to see Anna.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Let's go into the kitchen.
I'll tell you there.
Are you gonna play
a trick on me?
No.
Okay.
He wants to talk to me in private.
Could you believe that?
What do you want?
You.
You want me?
Is that what you're saying?
You're my wife.
We're married? You're telling me
that we got married at some point in time?
Yes.
Well... I'm getting married to Joseph.
He's a little bit older than you.
We have a little bit more in common.
But if the timing was
a little bit different, who knows? Maybe.
You're a handsome little boy.
But I'm getting married to someone else.
It's me...
Sean.
You're telling me
that you're Sean?
Yes.
Let's go.
You'll be making a big mistake
if you marry Joseph.
Jimmy, do you know
who this is?
Sean.
Does he live in the building?
No.
Then put him in a taxi
and send him home.
Sure.
Do you know how
to take the subway?
- Yeah.
- You're not supposed to be here tonight.
Go home.
So?
He says he's Sean.
Sean.
Right.
His name was Sean.
No, really.
Jimmy said downstairs.
He says he doesn't want me
to marry Joseph.
He said I shouldn't marry you.
I'll pull the car around.
Okay.
Good morning.
Oh. What's this?
It was laying on my desk.
Your man is here.
Hey, Anna.
Hey, Peter.
Hmm...
This is fantastic.
Are you trying to tell me
that this little boy is now urging you
not to marry Joseph?
What's fantastic about it?
Well, I mean, how often
does someone come along
claiming to be
somebody who's dead?
And much less a little boy.
Why didn't you tell me?
I--l'm telling you now.
I didn't want to upset you.
Well, who the hell is he?
Is he claiming to be... Sean,
or is he just called Sean?
He said, "lt's me, Sean."
What am I supposed to think?
I suppose that that tells me
that he's telling me he's Sean.
That he is your dead husband.
That he is...
Oh, that he is what?
Could it be true?
Oh, please.
God help me. Somebody.
This is Jimmy.
Watch the fort.
Why did you think
it would upset me?
Has it?
Well, you didn't show it to me
when you first got it, so...
I didn't open it
until I got to work.
Weren't you curious?
I didn't knowwho it was from.
Anyway, don't be silly.
Do me up.
We're gonna be late.
I can understand why a little boy
would be in love with you.
Let's stop talking
about the little boy.
I want to go out with my fiancé.
Okay.
I love you.
Don't you think we should call Jimmy
and find out who he is?
Christ. Let's just forget about it.
Aren't you interested?
No.
It's probably just some prank.
Hey, Jimmy.
Uh, Joseph, 1001.
Listen. a little boy named Sean
left a letter for Anna--
Jimmy's outside.
Who is this?
Sean.
I think your husband's downstairs.
Hey.
You're on your own?
My dad's upstairs.
Huh. Does your father live here?
No.
Can I talk to your father?
My father's a tutor.
Yes, hi. I'm Joseph.
I live upstairs.
Oh, sure. Hi.
Hi, Sean.
Everything all right?
I just need to talk to his father.
I'll be right back.
What's wrong?
- Everything's fine.
- Who are you?
Joseph from upstairs.
Yeah, sure.
What's wrong?
- Well--
- What's wrong? What's the problem?
I need to talk to you
about your son.
I'll be right back.
I want you to tell her right now that you'll
never see her or bother her again.
I can't.
Tell her you'll never see her
or bother her again.
No.
- Do it.
- No.
Tell her, Sean.
I can't.
Why did you write this?
Why did you go into her house?
I needed to talk to her.
Well, I want you to tell her right now that
you'll never see her or bother her again.
- No.
- Sean, tell her.
- No.
- You're hurting me.
Sean, tell her you'll never see her
or bother her again.
I can't.
Do you understand that?
- Say it.
- I can't.
I don't want you
to bother me again.
We're gonna be late.
Thank you.
Well done.
I don't know.
I just think it's
a little bit funny, that's all.
No, it's not funny.
I'm taking it out of context.
He says that he's somebody else,
and he believes that he is.
That's ridiculous.
I don't know these people.
I don't know who they are.
These people have money,
that's all.
And he wrote this woman a letter.
He's, um...
He wrote her a letter
not to marry this guy.
Permission to turn off
the light, sir.
Permission to turn off the light.
The men are talking
below deck, sir.
They're talking mutiny.
It's your responsibility
to steer the ship.
It's just seasickness, sir.
I'm not your stupid son anymore.
Go to the principal and explain
why you're late for my class!
Anna...
I thought you and Joseph
were going to talk to him.
We did.
- So why's he calling the house?
- I don't know.
What was the message?
He said he wanted you to go
and meet him in the park.
That you'd know where to go.
That's what he said.
You think this is a game?
You think this is funny?
No.
What if Bob comes
to my house and tests me?
How do you know Bob?
He was my brother-in-law.
If he asks me some questions
and I get them right, will you believe me?
Will you believe me?
Who told me
there wasn't a Santa Claus?
I'll know them when I see them.
You're just a little boy.
It's amazing.
It is.
I can't figure it out.
Me neither.
He knewwhere Sean died.
I'm tired.
Let's sleep.
We'll get him.
I'm going to tape this... okay?
I'm not a psychiatrist.
I'm not a therapist.
I'm just a regular doctor.
You know...
if you were my brother-in-law,
you'd say it was impossible for you
to be sitting right here in front of me.
You didn't believe
in life after death.
You believed
that only matter survives
and that the mind, soul, spirit--
whatever you want to call it--
disappears forever.
What do you want to know?
Okay.
Where did you live?
In the apartment
where Anna lives now.
Didn't you and Anna
have your own place?
- No.
- Why not?
I wasn't around much.
I was too busy working.
Where?
Different places.
Give me one.
Your hospital.
I lectured there.
About what?
Splitting the atom.
Why don't you and Laura
have your own place anymore?
- We do.
- Why aren't you living there?
- What do you remember about Anna--
- You lost your job.
No. No, I didn't lose my job.
We're redecorating.
We're having a baby.
Wow.
I didn't think she
could have a baby.
How about something...
intimate.
- Clifford was my best man.
- Clifford was your best man.
How about something
that you couldn't have overheard,
or looked up.
We did it on your sofa.
Okay.
The green sofa.
Look, you can think
whatever you want.
Everybody can think
what they want.
You can talk to whoever you want.
It doesn't matter.
I'm Sean. I love Anna.
and nothing is going to change that.
Can I get, uh, either of you
something to drink?
Uh, no.
Yes, please.
Want some juice?
- Apple.
- Please.
Please.
Remember me?
A little.
Well, I'm gonna keep
an eye on you...
... in case you start
upsetting this family.
Sean?
Would you like
to come sit down?
I'm gonna say it now.
I'm just gonna say it right now.
You are not my sister's husband.
He's not.
So let's just start from there.
And from now on,
we're gonna tell the truth.
No more lying.
Thank you, Lee.
There's cake left from my birthday party.
Would you like to have some?
He told me he's not
my son anymore.
Let him sleep here tonight.
I'm gonna break this spell.
I'll pick him up from school tomorrow
and I'll bring him back to you.
Don't touch that.
This is my desk.
I used to work here.
Do you know me?
Yes.
But we didn't meet officially
at the birthday party.
No.
No. That's right.
We didn't.
And do you know my name?
Do you know my name?
No.
Then how do you know me?
You were the one that told Anna
there wasn't a Santa Claus.
How do you know
where Sean died?
Do you know
what déjà vu is?
Sure.
It was like that.
How did Sean meet Anna?
Didn't she tell you?
How did Sean meet Anna?
We met at the beach.
How's Mr. Reincarnation
enjoying his cake?
He likes it.
Where's Anna?
The only reason she's
letting you stay in this house
is because she wants to help you.
So don't get the wrong idea.
How do you know
what you know?
I'm Sean.
You don't have me fooled.
I was surprised
to see you at the party.
I wasn't expecting you to come.
I'm sorry.
I-- It's been so long.
Too many memories, you know?
I'm sorry--
What? That's okay.
- I apologize.
- It's okay.
I've met, um...
I've met somebody who, uh,
who seems to be... Sean.
Wh-what do you mean?
What are you saying?
I understand that this
is gonna sound crazy,
and it's not like I haven't already
laughed about it, believe me, and...
um...
You know that I loved Sean.
You know.
So much.
Of course.
If anyone understands that,
you understand it.
You know I sent you a card.
Christmas.
You got those?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's taken me this long,
and I can't get him out
of my system. I can't.
I can't. It's not...
gotten any easier for me.
And, uh...
I met--I met Joseph,
and he--he loves me,
he sincerely does love me.
And he's... you know,
he's been dealing with me on this.
He's been, um...
... he's been acceptant of it
and he's not...
He's now grown insecure.
Because of him.
I mean, he's ten years old.
What are you saying?
He's a little boy.
He's a little boy,
I know, and...
he said, um--and he told me
his name was Sean, you know--
I really hoped that he was Sean,
I really--I wanted him to be Sean,
but I knew he wasn't Sean.
I knew it.
This is insane.
I mean...
It's insane, you know.
But I couldn't help it. I couldn't.
I don't think there's anything strange
about that. I mean, he is...
he is coming into...
our house.
He came into my mother's
birthday party unannounced.
He came in, and we thought that he was
with the, um, the Drummonds, you know.
You remember Mr.
and Mrs. Drummond, don't you?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Well...
He came in... with them
and he told me that he loves me
and that he doesn't want me
to marry Joseph.
And I thought,
"This is a joke. It's silly."
And I told him to go home,
and then, um, he sent me a letter
the next day that said...
"Don't marry Joseph."
I mean, normally
you'd think this is...
"This kid needs some help."
And I told him I didn't want
to see him again,
and then he, um...
... he collapsed.
And it, uh, it hit me.
Anna...
I don't know how he knows
so much about me, but he does.
How can I help?
I don't want to fall
in love again with Sean.
You understand?
And that's what's happening.
And I need you to come and help me,
and I need you to talk to him,
and I need you
to tell him to go away.
Sure.
Yeah, sure.
Because I can't do it.
A man has to support his wife. He has
to feed her, defend her, take care of her.
How are you gonna feed me,
defend me... take care of me?
How are you gonna do that?
I'll get a job.
How are you
gonna fulfill my needs?
I know what you're talking about.
You're ready for that?
You ever made love to a girl?
You'd be the first.
That's my bus.
Listen, I appreciate
that you like me so much, but you're...
you're imagining something that it--
it isn't real.
I mean, you're gonna eventually
meet someone your own age
and you'll forget about me.
I'm just gonna wait for her here
by this window.
- No answer?
- Uh, no.
- I'm gonna let them in.
- Pretend I'm not here.
- They have an appointment too.
- Sure.
This is a four-bedroom apartment.
The kitchen's back here.
And if you come this way, the moldings
and the wall fixtures are original.
This is the first bedroom.
Isn't it spacious?
I just love the light.
No. I'm fine.
I think he should hear the music tonight
and know that we're getting married.
Great.
Bye.
What are you doing?
I'm looking at my wife.
I want you to leave.
I'd like you to stop that.
It's not a funny matter.
- It's not a funny matter.
- No!
Anna, stay away!
- Stay away.
- Joe!
Hey, Joe...
Joe. Joe!
Joe!
I'm great.
- Are you okay?
- I'm great. I'm great.
He has no clue
how to make something happen.
He's living in a land where he's pretending
to be something instead of doing the job.
And that's the real problem.
I'm the one who should
be respected, but obviously not.
No, Joseph!
He kicked my chair!
Hello?
- Where are you going to stay?
- Bob's place.
I'll talk to her.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm okay.
Good night.
I guess we missed the show.
You're a little late.
Clara left a bottle
of wine in the car.
She'll be up in a minute.
I need to speak to Clifford.
That's not Sean.
Yes, it is.
No. It's not.
Yes, it is.
Hi.
You see how dirty my hands are?
Take me to the bathroom
so I can wash up.
Come in.
Shut the door.
Dry them.
I've moved.
My new address.
Don't tell Anna.
Okay.
Let's go.
It is illegal.
Anna, look at me.
You're going to go in there
right now--
- Move.
- Sit down!
You're going to tell Sean
to go home.
No.
If you don't, I will call his mother,
and his mother will call the police.
You understand?
No.
Laura, move.
What are we going to do?
We're gonna tell your mother
that everything is okay.
Then what?
I don't know yet,
but I'm thinking.
You're not Sean.
Yes, I am.
When you opened the door
for me yesterday...
I knew you weren't Sean.
Who are you?
I thought you said you're Sean.
I'm your lover.
Anna's my lover.
I'm your lover.
Anna's your wife.
If you had been Sean...
... and I kind of hoped you had...
... you would've come to me first.
And I would've explored this.
But you didn't.
Are they in the bag?
Here they are.
Hello.
Anna's little love letters.
You can't go around
saying you're someone you're not.
Wipe your feet.
- Wipe your feet.
- I did too!
- Hi, Clara.
- Hi. How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Good.
- Have a nice night.
- You, too.
He gave them to me unopened.
To prove that he loved me more.
He couldn't leave her,
and I hated her for that. Hated her.
When I found out she was getting
married again, I got us invited.
What a nice present it would be
to give her her letters back.
I wrapped them.
And I took them.
But I couldn't do it.
I changed my mind.
Sorry, kid,
but you're not him.
Excuse me. Anna.
Your mother just called.
She said your sister just gave birth
to a healthy baby girl.
- Wow.
- Congratulations.
Maybe that's Sean.
- I believe him.
- I know you do.
There's no way I'm gonna
leave that boy. No way.
Don't try to make me.
You're wasting your time. Forget it.
So what are you going to do?
I don't know.
The best thing
for you to do is this.
Go home and write him
a goodbye letter.
Then go to see Joseph
after work tomorrow.
Don't call.
Just show up.
Tell him you're sorry,
you made a mistake.
I can't.
When Laura wakes up,
I'll call you.
I can't.
What if we open the beach house?
Then you can get married
where I married your father.
You love the water.
It'll be beautiful in May.
Didn't you hear what I said?
What's your name?
Where's your mother?
Why don't you tell us where you live?
We'll take you home.
I can't do that.
Why not?
I have to go tell Anna
l'm not her husband.
I thought I was Sean,
but I found out he was in love
with another woman.
So I can't be him.
'Cause I'm in love with Anna.
- No kidding.
Central, we have a male, white,
approximately nine to ten years of age.
Blue jacket, black shirt,
gray pants.
Let's take him back to the house.
Hey! Come back here!
He's back.
I called his mother.
She'll be here soon.
He's in the bath.
I have a plan.
We're gonna run away together.
You and me.
Okay?
And in 1 1 years,
you're gonna turn 21.
Okay?
You hear me?
Do you hear me?
And we're gonna get married.
Okay?
I wonder...
... what you're gonna look like.
I love you, Sean.
I'm not Sean.
I'm not Sean.
Because I love you.
You make no sense.
I can't explain it to you better.
You're gonna have to.
Can I please have a towel, Anna.
I have to get my clothes back on.
My mother's going
to be here soon.
You're a little liar.
Aren't you?!
You're a little liar!
Is that what you are?
Is that what you are?!
- Yes.
- Yes? Is that what you said?
Yes.
Wow.
I...
You certainly had me fooled.
I... thought you were my dead husband.
I thought you
were my dead husband.
But you're just a little boy.
In my bathtub.
I never liked Sean.
What happened to me
was not my fault.
There's no way I could've behaved
any differently, you know.
What I did...
wasn't my fault.
What happened to me
wasn't my fault,
and I can't
be held accountable for it.
There's no way I could ever
have said to him...
"Go away."
I couldn't do it.
It was a mistake.
And... I'm sorry.
I'm...
But I wanna be with you.
I wanna be with you.
Yes, I do.
And I wanna get married.
And...
I wanna have a good life,
and I wanna be happy.
That's all I want.
Peace.
Okay.
Thank you.
Careful with the wire.
And right here would be lovely.
Okay.
Lift up with your left foot.
There we are.
Down.
Excellent.
Okay. I'm gonna meter you.
Okay.
And close your eyes.
Thank you.
Excellent.
Okay, if you could look
right at me, please.
And lift the bouquet.
Just like that is fine.
Lovely.
Look straight to me.
Wonderful.
Hold the bouquet up.
Bouquet up, please.
Anna? Bouquet up, please.
Anna?
Looks good.
Nice big smile. Excellent.
Dear Anna.
thanks for your letter.
I'm really happy
being back at my school.
And my friends don't know
what happened. so it's okay.
but it's a good thing
that it's gone away now.
Tell everyone I'm sorry
I made a problem for them.
They said they still haven't figured out
what was wrong with me.
But they said the good thing is
that nothing really happened.
Well. I guess I'll see you
in another lifetime.
Looks good.
And a big smile.
That's a great smile.
Nicely done.
Who's next, guys?
I'll take your card.
Hands on your lap...
