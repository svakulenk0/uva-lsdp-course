Oh; thank you; Arnold.
L- I can manage that.
But I still don't see why you couldn't
wait a couple of weeks.
Why go all the way up to Loki?
Well; we want
to hear Grace Makanga speak;
and she won't be coming to Nairobi.
I see.
Oh, sweetheart, don't bother
to see us off. It could be ages.
Okay, well-
It's too hot to be standing around.
If you're sure.
Bye.
Bye, Arnold.
Let me take your bag for you.
Thank you.
Bye, sweetheart.
See you in, uh- in a couple of days.
-

-
Sandy, he's here.
Hi. Come in. Oh, hi, Sandy.
You caught me skiving, I'm afraid.
How's Gloria? Well?
Gloria's fine.
You haven't heard from Tessa,
I suppose?
No, she's, uh, up north
with, um, Arnold Bluhm.
Look, old chap, do you think you could
stop doing that a moment?
Something wrong?
She didn't say anything
about returning by road?
From Loki?
Well, that wouldn't surprise me,
knowing Tessa. I mean, I hope not.
Dangerous country.
What is it, Sandy?
We're getting reports
of a white woman, black driver,
found early this morning;
southern end of Lake Turkana;
dead-killed; it seems.
You think it might be Tessa?
Seems they hired a car and driver
in Loki and then headed east.
They spent the night at Lodwar.
They shared a room; Justin.
The dead black isn't Arnold Bluhm.
Most terribly sorry.
And how sure are you?
It's not looking good.
It's...
good of you to tell me, Sandy.
Can't have been easy.
Diplomacy; therefore;
as we've demonstrated;
is the very map and marker
of civilization,
pointing nations the safest way
through country...
fraught with peril.
And that's it.
Uh; Sir Bernard Pellegrin has asked me
to convey his; uh; regrets...
that he's been unable to deliver
his lecture in person.
And I thank you on my own behalf
for your very kind attention.
Thank you.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Yeah? Yeah, sorry.
Excu- Excuse me.
Sir, I've just got one question.
I just wondered whose map,
um, is Britain using...
when it completely ignores the United Nations
and decides to invade Iraq?
Or do you- do you think...
it's more diplomatic to bend
to the will of a superpower...
and-and politely take part
in Vietnam; the sequel?
Well, uh, l- I can't speak
for Sir Bernard-
Oh, I thought that's
why you were here.
I mean, diplomats have
to go where they're sent.
So do Labradors.
Ooh.
- Ouch.
-
Well; I think that; no; Sir Bernard
would no doubt argue...
that when, um, peaceful means
are exhausted, then-
Exhausted?
Mr. Quayle; they're not exactly
exhausted; are they?
I mean, they're just- they're just-
No, they are just lying
in the way of the tanks.
No; l-l-let's face it.
We've taken 60 years...
to build up this international organization
called the United Nations,
which is meant to avoid wars,
- and now we just blow it up
because our car's running out of petrol.
- Sit down, Tessa, for Christ's sake.
- L- I think-
- Hold on a minute.
Let's see what he says.
I think the questioner
is making a valid point,
and that a nation's foreign policy...
- should not be determined
by narrow commercial interests.
- That's bullshit.
That's bullshit.
You have to take responsibility.
You are being paid to apologize
for this pathetic country of Britain,
and he can explain to us why we've burned
our diplomatic credentials...
and why we're killing, you know,
thousands of innocent people...
just for-just for some barrels of oil...
and a photo opportunity
on the White House lawn.
Why?
Are you all right?
Yes, thanks.
You were courageous.
No. No; I was completely rude.
- It was just bad behavior, and l-
- You were impassioned.
I'm so embarrassed. Sorry.
Please don't be embarrassed.
I'm really sorry.
And, uh, thanks very much.
You... tried to protect me.
Very feebly.
No, you were-you were-
You weren't feeble. I just-
Anyway, it was a very dull lecture.
It was a dull lecture,
but even so I shouldn't have-
Well, look, can l-
can I buy you a coffee or-
I owe you a drink. Come on.
All right.
You can buy me a drink.
I'm Justin, by the way.
Tessa. How do you do?
Pleased to meet you.
Yeah, yeah.
Pleased to meet you.
- You were quite scary,
but I don't blame you.
-
It was absolute bollocks,
so you're quite right to challenge-
I'm rather nervous,
I have to confess.
Me too. This way.
Oh, do come in.
Yeah, please. Of course.
Thank you.
You lead the way.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Take a left.
All right.
Wriggle.
There we go.
Thank you.
What for?
For... this wonderful gift.
How very generous of me.
No, l-
You-You're so-
You know what I mean.
I know what you mean.
I feel safe with you.
I can imagine when you were six.
You leading the revolution.
No. No, I was very conventional.
Here, Justin, put this on.
Mr. Quayle? Please.
Please.
Know this lady, sir?
Yes, I do. It's, uh-
It's my wife, Tessa.
Sandy.
Come on.
Tessa.
My God, what a surprise.
How'd you get in?
Take me to Africa with you.
What? Roll you up in a rug?
Pack you in a tea chest?
Very funny.
I'd have to smuggle you in
as illicit goods.
I couldn't declare you.
Oh, listen. I could put you
in one of these plant boxes, and-
You'd be very comfortable
wrapped up in a little piece of, uh-
I could label you. "Tessa."
I'm serious.
Um, yeah, I can see you are.
And in what-what capacity
should I take you to Africa?
I don't mind. You can take me
as your mistress, lover, wife.
There's too much choice.
L-Well, I'm-
I'm flattered
that you would like-
No. No.
Justin, please don't
say that sentence.
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That's really-
Just yes or no?
Well, we-we hardly know
one another. I mean-
You can learn me.
Learn you?
Mmm.
Yes or no?
Then l-
-
-
Oh.
A gift.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
It's beautiful.
- Hey.
- Arnold.
That's so nice.
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah.
They made it for me.
-
-
Hey; Mr. Bluhm.!
Careful.
Ooh. Take my hand.
What did you give her; Arnold?
Nevirapine. The government clinic
didn't have any again.
Jomo.
Yes, Mama Tessa?
Have you had your test yet?
No.
Jomo.
If she's H.I.V. Positive,
chances are you are too.
Look, Dr. Bluhm, I really must go.
We can talk about this later.
Thank you.
Take you 10 minutes.
- Woodrow is very particular about time.
I will be in trouble. Bye.
- I'll see you later.
Jesus!
You shouldn't be
wandering around in this heat.
Arnold, stop fussing.
You're as bad as Justin.
If you were my wife,
I'd tie you to the bed.
Then what would you do, Doctor?
That's another story.
Tell me what you'd do.
Hey!
All right.
Now; for the first time;
we are exploring a new territory.
This is a new discovery...
for the famous marine biologist-
Jacques Cousteau.
You are a voyeur.
It's fantastic.
Now we are going down, down, down.
Oh, what do we have here?
Zoom.!
Wipe it.
I must keep this new discovery
for posterity...
and admire the new person inside.
You have to go wipe this.
Go and wipe it.
Wipe it right now.
No, I can't wipe it.
I'm completely inept with computers.
- I'm gonna keep it.
I'm sorry. I love it.
-
Will you see who that's from,
darling?
Sure.
What is it?
What?
The e-mail.
Oh, it's, um-
It's just junk- some ad.
- For?
- For the Nairobi Hilton.
Oh, my boobs hurt.
Would you; uh; mind; uh-
Weekend package deal.
Two nights for the price of one.
Mmm. Two guests
for the price of one.
Sweetheart, would you come
and make yourself useful?
Yeah, I'm coming.
My darling. Sweetheart;
I'd like you to put this up
right in the middle.
Right?
Yeah.
So, um-
Right there.
Mm-hmm.
What do you think?
I think it's gorgeous.
I think it's very tangled.
No; no; no.
I meant- I meant
about a weekend at the Hilton.
Oh, no. It's a bit flashy
for my taste.
Is it?
Mm-hmm.
Oh. I wouldn't know.
L- I've never been there.
Well, I have. I was there the other night
meeting someone with Arnold.
Oh, well, just a thought.
Sweetheart.
Were you just inviting me away
for a dirty weekend at the Hilton?
Mm-hmm.
Were you?
I would love to,
but maybe after... Arturo is born.
Oh, Tessa.
We're not calling him
Arturo, please.
Why not?
No. Not- Not Arturo...
or Giuseppe-
All right. Then what about...
Garth- Daddy's name?
No, no. Come on.
No, not Garth
or ditto Che or any-
Che?
I just don't want any of these
mad, eccentric, hippieish-
Che?
Alternative-
Yes, your revolutionary half.
I think we should call him, in that case,
Che Muffin Quayle.
Muffin?
Yes, the Quayle genes.
Where do you get Muffin from?
No one's heard of muffins.
High tea by the jolly study fire...
while the starving mob
burns London.
Is that- Is that how you see me?
No.
I see you buying the mob
fish and chips...
while you wait
for law and order to return.
And I love you the way you are.
What about Arnold?
What about Arnold?
As a name.
Hmm.
Be such a nice gesture.
Well, perhaps it'll be a girl.
Mmm. I think it's a boy.
I think it's a girl.
You'd better get dressed.
Move that tray.
Dry these glasses.
- Can you open your windows, please?
Please get out of the car.
-
Dr. Joshua Ngaba,
Kenya Health Ministry.
Sir Bernard Pellegrin,
head of F.C.O. Africa desk.
May I convey Her Majesty's
warmest greetings?
I thought that Arnold
was going up-country.
He is. Oh, don't worry.
He's not gonna take me.
I've already asked him.
Hmm.
Good. And, Tessa-
Yes?
I'd be happier
if you stayed out of Kibera,
at least until
the baby's born anyway.
Um, just you wait until
I'm single again.
Hello, Tim. How are you?
Hi.
Are you struggling through
without Maude tonight?
One of her party headaches.
I take mine standing up.
Oh, how manly of you.
Isn't it just?
Hello, Arnold.
Tessa.
Hello, Ghita, darling.
Ooh, what a lovely sari.
Interesting guests; Mr. Donohue.
This is Kenya; Dr. Bluhm.
Seems only fair to invite the odd native.
Mmm. The health minister's turn,
was it?
So it seems.
Who's that he's talking to?
I have no idea.
Thought your spies
knew everything, Tim.
Only God knows everything.
He works for Mossad.
You've met Dr. Ngaba, have you?
Yes, at the opening
of a new state-of-the-art clinic...
without autoclaves
for sterilizing.
Mmm.
Probably converted them
into a Mercedes.
Hmm.
I've never met an alchemist before.
Tessa, darling.
Ah, Tessa.
Hello, Porter.
May I introduce Tessa Quayle,
Dr. Ngaba,
the wife of our representative
for aid effectiveness?
Pleasure to meet you.
How do you do?
And this is Dr. Bluhm
from Médecins dans I'univers.
Good evening.
Dr. Bluhm and I have met.
Yes, it was at the opening for the clinic
that didn't have the sterilizing equipment.
We never met; Dr. Ngaba;
but I know your work.
Do you know Sir Kenneth Curtiss,
Chief Executive ofThreeBees?
- Yes; also by reputation.
Good evening.
- Good evening.
It's the most successful
company here in Kenya.
We're very proud ofhim.
And which of the bees are you?
You were going to show us
the garden room, Porter.
There is just one thing
that I'd like to thank Dr. Ngaba for-
the free nevirapine.
He's, uh, persuaded the manufacturers
to donate it to H.I.V. -positive mothers.
It's a wonderful thing.
Shall we?
The problem is,
it isn't actually reaching them.
Some, but not all.
So we've been wondering,
is that a standard cock-up, Dr. Ngaba,
or- or were the pills converted
into the limo that you arrived in?
I think that's probably enough.
If you'll come through here, Doctor.
Justin.
Excuse me.
You've gotta do something about Tessa.
Well, what would you
like me to do, Sandy?
Well, she's embarrassing our guests.
Her and that bloody Bluhm.
There'll be hell to pay,
I can tell you.
Well, the- the squall
seems to have passed.
If you can't control her,
you should keep her locked up.
You're wanted on the veranda;
Mr. Woodrow.
Yes.
The poinsettias
are so big here, they'll be best
towards the back of the border.
Hey, sexy.
You look divine.
Sandy, I think you're a pervert.
Stop looking at me like that.
We're to have a baby in a week.
Can I come and visit you
in the hospital?
You want to visit me in Uhuru?
Uhuru? Tessa, you're not
having it there.
Oh, Sandy, come on. Kibera women
have their babies there every day.
It's perfectly safe.
No, it's not. It's madness.
Just- Can I just choose-
Wait a minute. That looks a good one.
Shall we run away?
Yeah, come on then.
Take me for lunch.
-  How are you?
- I'm fine. Thank you.
How are you?
I'm fine. Thank you. How are you?
How are you?
I'm fine. Thank you.
How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
- Look, near the car.
- Jomo is getting a test.
Of course. You told him to.
It was a suggestion,
not an order.
- What are they carrying
in those littlejars?
- It's probably saliva.
But that's not how you test
for H.I. V. Here; is it?
They're also testing for T.B.
Why?
When they test for H.I.V.,
they also test for T.B. Free here.
- What, just for free?
- A small extra service to humanity.
They're a drug company,
Arnold. Come on.
No drug company does
something for nothing.
Is there... something
you're not telling me-
Arnold?
Hello, Sandy.
I'm so sorry, Tessa.
Gloria sends her sympathies.
What can one say?
It was a boy.
- Did Justin already tell you that?
- Tessa. Tessa.
This one was born healthy though.
Weren't you;
my beautiful; beautiful darling?
His name is Baraka.
It means blessing.
I... don't quite see.
Who the mother is?
Her name is Wanza Kilulu.
She's 15; and she's dying.
Kioko's 12.
He walked 40 kilometers
just to keep the flies off
his sister and her baby.
Perhaps that's the blessing.
Darling; please don't.
Please sit here, Mr. Woodrow.
I'll wait outside.
Thank you.
Kioko, here you are.
You sweetheart.
- Justin, my darling, could you please
go and get me a fresh bottle of water?
- Hmm? Sure.
Now, Sandy?
Yes?
If I tell you something,
will you listen to me?
Not here, Tessa.
No, Sandy,
if I tell you that that-
that that girl over there
was being murdered,
would you believe me?
Tessa, you're tired.
You're feverish.
No. No, I'm not.
Now we haven't got all of the evidence yet,
but when we get it,
if I bring it to you, will you-will you
actually do something for once?
What you need is rest.
Now what I'm- I'm talking about
are coincidences.
Tessa, you've got to stop involving yourself
in matters that don't concern you.
You're embarrassing the High Commission,
and you're not doing Justin's career any good.
Justin doesn't know what I do.
That doesn't surprise me.
Sandy, you've got to promise me...
that you're going to act
on what we tell you.
We?
Me and Arnold.
Please?
All right. I promise.
Within reason.
Within reason.
Uh, there's a man.
She's raving mad.
You've got to get her to a proper clinic.
With white doctors,
Mr. Woodrow?
For Christ's sake, Justin,
she's your wife.
Yes, she's my wife.
You see; she's dead.
What did you give her?
It doesn't matter.
Dr. Lorbeer; you have got to stop
testing on patients with H.I. V.
- It- Look at me.
- I have to go.
Justin, stop the car.
Stop, stop, stop.
Why? What is it?
Tessa.
It's 40 kilometers to Miluri.
It's gonna take them all night.
We can't involve ourselves
in their lives, Tessa.
Why?
Be reasonable.
There are millions of people.
They all need help.
That's what the agencies
are here for.
Yeah, but these are three people
that we can help.
Please.
Justin.
I'm sorry, Tessa.
I have to put you first.
I have to get you home.
Probably got enough
there now; Mustafa.
Yeah?
I think.
Just the flowers this time, please.
You can spare the weeds.
The pest must eat too, bwana.
Yes, I know. If only they would.
They can eat the weeds.
Look, you should be wearing gloves
with that, you know?
And there's a mask
if you want it.
Okay.
It's an outrageous thing. It's almost as if
it's a- it's a marriage of convenience-
Shh.
Tessa.
And the only thing it's gonna produce
is dead offspring.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
- What the fuck is that?
- What?
I said, what the fuck is that?
Tessa, it's pesticide.
It- It's just unbelievable.
Would you just get that thing
out of this house?
Well, if you feel that strongly about it,
yes, Tessa- anything.
It would help if you might explain to me
what's upsetting her.
I mean, this doesn't kill people, does it?
Unless they swallow it?
No.
What? Then can you tell me
why she's so-
You have to trust her, Justin.
It's hard, you know,
when she-we don't talk about-
- Does she blame me for losing the baby?
- Of course not. Give her time.
Tell her I'll be back later.
Wherever there are drug companies...
testing their drugs on people
who they think are expendable;
you'll find organizations like ours
trying to fight back.
Of course, the problem is that they have
millions to spend on P. R...
while we work with volunteers
and a few donated computers.
If you're gonna dig deeper;
then most of us have Web sites.
Check out Oxfam; M.S.F. ;
Health Action International-
Put it in here.
Just mind the roses, please, Mustafa.
Hi; Birgit.
Sorry. More questions.
Tessa never sleeps.
Always time for you, Tessa.
Take care of yourself; Tessa; okay?
I think you're a bit-
I'm very tired. I'm sorry.
I can't translate that word to you.
So you'd better ask that kind,
nice husband of yours-
Okay. See you; Tessa.
Hi.
Hi.
It's bloody awful weather.
You really shouldn't have waited up.
Good. Then I think
you should go to bed.
I'm safe home now, sweetheart.
No, you're drenched.
Look, take those wet things off.
Tessa, come to bed
with me, please.
Yeah, l-
I will, but there's, um, something
I have to do first. It's important.
Tessa,
whatever it is
that you and Arnold are doing;
I'd like it to stop.
Wow.
Who have you been talking to?
No one. These are
my concerns, all right?
- I'm thinking of your health.
- No. No, you're not.
They've asked you to rein me in,
and you're doing it.
It's just unbelievable.
What the hell are you talking about?
I hope you know me better than that.
Your life is your own.
That was always our agreement.
No. No, no. The agreement was...
that my work was gonna be my own.
That's what makes me who I am.
I mean, if you stop me from doing my work,
then I am nothing. I'm just nobody. L-
I'm not trying to stop you
doing anything.
Please.
I'm sorry.
I'm just tired. That's all.
Very tired.
Then come to bed.
Hmm?
Will you get me up for breakfast?
I've got to finish my report.
Just smash it like that.
Oh.! Right.
Now if you just put those there.
You want probably to break them up
into smaller pieces.
A bit more vermilion.
Oh, you're just very blasé,
aren't you?
You know, just through feel.
No, I wouldn't- No.
I wouldn't call it a parasite; no.
You're gonna be late for your match.
Quick, quick, quick, quick!
Kenny, I can't discuss this on the phone.
That cow of yours
wouldn't even give me an appointment.
Time was you buggers couldn't get
your tongues far enough up my arse.
What's changed?
Hi.
If I find out that this has got
anything to do with that bitch-
Come to my office.
L- I've got to go, Kenny. Bye.
Having trouble with ThreeBees, Sandy?
Just Kenny being Kenny.
Oh. Nothing to do
with my report then?
Oh, he's just ranting.
Oh, Sandy, you promised me
you were gonna do something.
I sent your report to London.
Really?
Yes.
To Pellegrin?
Yes.
And?
There was no official response.
Well, what was there then?
Well, just a personal letter. That's all.
Saying?
It's private.
What do you mean,
it's private?
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.
I sent him an official document.
I gonna have to call Pellegrin
and ask him.
No, no. Don't do that, Tessa.
Why?
It's serious.
You know me well enough to know
that I'm not gonna take no
for an answer. Come on.
Tessa,
I'm supposed to keep an eye on you.
What?
Report where you are,
what you're doing.
Trust me, Tessa.
This is something
that you should not pursue.
I say that as a friend
who cares deeply for you.
Sandy?
Oh, Tessa.
Hi, Gloria.
Been wondering
where you'd got to.
Darling, you know,
we really have to leave now.
Match starts in half an hour.
Harry's got a cricket match.
That is, you're still coming, right?
Yes, of course.
You're not too busy, no?
One sec.
Right. Okay.
Justin's waiting for you in the car.
All right. Tell him
I'll be right down.
Sandy, what do you think of me?
I think you're beautiful.
Do you?
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
Well, you can have me
if you show me the letter.
Ooh.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
When?
Um, when I get back from Loki.
Tessa,
if anyone ever found out-
I'd shown you the letter,
I'd be ruined.
No one's gonna know, Sandy.
Put it back in the drawer.
Lock the drawer.
Put the key back.
Read it at once.
Promise?
Promise.
My continent, Africa, is staggering...
under the weight of not one,
but three plagues.
Yet still the governments
of the U.S.A. And Europe;
at the behest of the pharmaceutical companies
that seem to control them;
drag their feet and continue
to give us endless reasons...
why we should buy your branded drugs
at five; 10; 20 times the price.
Sweetheart, don't bother
to see us off. It could be ages.
Okay, well, if you're sure.
It's too hot to be
standing around.
Bye, Arnold.
Let me take your bag for you.
Thank you.
Bye, sweetheart.
See you in, uh- in a couple of days.
Tessa.
Tessa?
Yeah.
The bodies were locked
inside a car and had been mutilated.
Turn it off, will you?
Certainly. Sorry.
Mr. Quayle.!
- Mustafa.
-
Mmm.
-
Tessa's family.
- Yes.
Police were here; bwana.
When?
This morning. They took away
Mama Tessa's things.
Better make a list
of what's missing.
Mustafa.
See? I told you.
They took away the CD's,
the diskettes, the computer.
They came here and took the-
the files, the papers.
Just didn't want to touch anything
so that you can come
and see for yourself what they did.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, Mustafa.
Dypraxa?
Huh.
Darling Tessa; you have hurt me
more than you know.
Trusting you to be honorable;
I afforded you; against all the rules;
an opportunity that you have abused
in the worst way.
I beg you; for the sake of my career;
to return what you took.
If you will not; then at least save
what is left of me...
by chucking in your ridiculous sham
of a marriage; as I will mine;
and bolting with me
to the end of the earth.
I love you; I love you...
and I love you.
Sandy.
I'm sorry to have been
so long, Sandy.
Seems they've been in here too.
Anything missing
in the bedroom?
Her laptop's gone
and her disks and all her files.
Yes. It's a mess.
What's in that?
Oh, uh, her will,
amongst other things.
Oh.
Seems she wanted
to be buried in Africa.
Oh.
Darling Tessa. Hmm.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
Could someone please explain
what they're doing, please?
Look, Justin, it- it's just concrete.
It's to keep the grave robbers out.
Tessa expressed a wish to lie...
in African soil,
not in bloody concrete.
Nothing can grow in concrete.
Kindly tell them to leave,
please, Ghita.
And you too, please, gentlemen.
Thank you. It was kind of you to come.
Hello.
Kioko. It's Kioko?
Yes.
You're Wanza's brother.
Justin.
Yes.
You brought a card for Tessa?
Yes.
You walked here?
Did you walk?
Thank you.
You'll always protect me; won't you?
Yeah. Of course.
Of course I'll protect you.
And I'm gonna protect you.
Justin?
Hi. You're a million miles away.
Yes, I was. Um, I'm taking refuge
in my nasturtium seeds.
Listen, you know-you know
that I'm here for you, don't you?
Yes, I do. Thank you, Ghita.
You're a good friend.
I, uh- I'm afraid I wanted
to ask you a question.
Rather a delicate question.
L-Well, maybe it's indelicate.
Um-
Anything.
What do you think that Arnold and Tessa
were doing at Lake Turkana?
Oh, I see.
You know, they did spend
enough time together to give everyone
the impression that they were-
Come on; Justin.
You know what this place is like.
If you can't have sex, you have
other people's sex- real or imagined.
Who's this?
It's Claude.
Arnold's boyfriend.
I'd never have guessed.
It's illegal here.
You don't shout about it.
Ah, well.
Wish she could've told me.
Perhaps she didn't think
you needed to know.
Tessa Quayle I have;
but I have no Wanza Kilulu.
Are you sure that is the right name?
Uh, yes, Wanza Kilulu, and, uh, there was
a white doctor attending to her,
and he was there when she died.
Perhaps he conducted the postmortem.
Maybe you have a record of the postmortem.
If I have no patient's record,
how can I have a postmortem record?
And we don't have
European doctors working here.
Right, but her name is definitely
Wanza Kilulu,
and I remember that she was-
Well, if she does not appear
in my records here-
I'm sorry. She does not-
I don't think she was-
Yes. No, I understand.
I mean, I'm not mad here.
She was in the bed.
Okay, fine, yeah. I'm sorry.
You want money?
Fifty.
Fifty. Fifty.
Sorry.
He helped my wife,
and I'm trying to find him.
I think he lives here,
but I have no idea where he is.
It's a family. You don't know him?
Kioko Kilulu.
Kioko Kilulu?
Yes, a name. Do you know?
Who is it? Who is it?
It's a family, from here.
-  A girl?
-
He's a young boy; about 12. No?
Kioko?
Kioko, hello.
Hello.
Do- Do you remember me?
I've been looking for you.
No trouble.
You're not in trouble.
I just want to talk to you.
Is this the clinic
where Wanza was treated?
I cannot help you without-
Next.
Can I help you?
Why-Why was that lady
turned away?
She refuses treatment.
But she seemed to want
to have treatment.
She's a T.B. Patient
who discontinued her treatment.
Her card was canceled.
Isn't that all the more reason
to inoculate her child?
This is diphtheria vaccine.
What is your business here; please?
My name is Quayle.
I'm from the British High Commission.
Do you see any of your countrymen
here, Mr. Quayle?
Uh, excuse me one-
May I see your card, Kioko?
I see. This is in Wanza's name.
That's the family-
It's a family medical card, right?
Yes.
And what does "I.C."mean?
It means informed consent.
It means they consented to treatment
and have family medical entitlement.
And that treatment is Dypraxa?
But if they don't give consent,
then they lose the right to medical care?
It's not much of a choice; is it?
I suppose they're not even informed
that they're testing a new drug?
- I don't make the rules; Mr. Quayle.
- Mr. Quayle?
Yes?
Will you please
come with us?
Kioko, there's your card.
Thank you.
Why is the child
being questioned?
It's okay.
Why did you come to talk to this boy?
He attended my wife's funeral,
so I came to thank him.
For a diplomat,
you're not a very good liar.
Well, I haven't risen very high.
We know about your wife;
Mr. Quayle.
He was her lover- this, uh, Bluhm.
So people are pleased to tell me.
These men you hired to kill them-
They rape and kill her,
and they let him go.
Where did you find them?
Well, perhaps I asked a policeman.
Can you tell me what
I'm doing here, please?
We've been asked to... keep you here.
Right. Help us help you.
I'm sorry. Could you explain?
I have not acquired a taste
for Kenyan tea, I'm afraid.
Look, we're trying to help you.
You help us, we help you.
If you give us something small,
we can always say we didn't find you.
Don't you believe I have the power
to let you go?
Can I help you?
Yes.
My name is Woodrow,
Acting Head of Mission
for Her Majesty's government.
This is Detective Inspector Deasey
of Scotland Yard.
Mr. Deasey will be inquiring
into the death of Mr. Quayle's wife.
If you have any questions,
ask them of him.
Is that clear?
You weren't mistreated?
No.
You know whose territory you are in; Mr. -
What did you say your name was?
And your name is?
Right.
The, uh-The boy Kioko
who I came to see-
What have you done with him?
He ran away.
I hope nothing's happened to him.
Where's your car, Justin?
It's near the market.
Is that the official thinking then-
that Arnold killed Tessa?
I'm afraid that's looking likely.
Do you think
that he was her lover?
I'm afraid that's looking likely too.
What were they doing
up at Lake Turkana?
Romantic setting.
Sorry to have to say it, old chap.
But why suspect Bluhm then?
I mean, there may have been others-
other lovers.
If she was an unfaithful wife;
why stop at Arnold?
I wouldn't listen to rumor,
unless you've evidence?
Yes, evidence.
That's always the problem.
Justin;
be a good chap
and leave this to us.
There are proper channels
for these things.
Ghita; hi. Thanks for coming.
So why did you want to meet here?
Something that we shouldn't
be seen talking about?
Dypraxa.
I know that Tessa and Arnold
wrote a report
on the ThreeBees trials,
and I need to know
what happened to it.
What makes you think I know?
Because they trusted you,
and so do I.
Help me, please, Ghita.
All I know is that Tessa
gave Sandy a copy.
Sandy? Why him?
Sandy was a compromise-
semiofficial.
Arnold wanted to go public with it.
Tessa wouldn't.
Because?
Because she wanted to do it your way,
through channels.
But, Justin, I wouldn't bother
looking for it.
If it threatens British commercial interests,
it would've been shredded.
She could've brought it to me.
She didn't want
to get you involved.
Why?
Ghita, why didn't she
want me involved?
To protect you.
Do you know if she showed
the report to anyone else?
Kenny Curtiss.
Time of the month, Kenny?
Fuck off.
Might help if you took
the fucking flag out.
Well, get closer to the fucking hole,
and maybe I will.
Interesting man you got there, Crick.
Must be the only white caddy in Africa.
Look, KDH are waiting for me
to default on my Dypraxa commitments,
and I have a cash flow problem.
What are you lot going to do about it?
We never promised
to protect you commercially.
You protect me?
That's fucking rich.
A word or two from me
in the right black ear,
a couple of cases of Krug,
and you'd be on the next plane
back home.
I mean, I spend more money
on champagne in a year
than your shop's annual fucking budget.
Oh, there you go-
Cause of your cash-flow problem.
You're in my eyeline, old chap.
You're what passes forJames Bond
around here.
Get Her Majesty's secret service
to pull a few strings.
It's what you spies do, isn't it?
Is it?
Never really sure what it is we do.
Don't even think about
bullying me, old man.
I'm not a member of your gentlemen's club.
I don't have to play by the rules.
So it seems.
Call that one in, shall we?
Mr. Curtiss, I'm sorry
to disturb your game.
My name is Justin Quayle
from the High Commission.
I believe you knew my wife, Tessa.
Justin. Didn't know
you were a member here.
Yes, I met her
at one of your parties.
She came to see you, I think.
She gave you a report
that she had written on Dypraxa.
Justin, I really don't think
this is the time or the place-
I hope you didn't find her too troublesome,
because she could be a terrier
when she had a scent.
Huh, sounds like you're
describing a bitch.
I'm sorry about your loss,
but I don't remember
being given any report.
Well, that's odd,
because she noted it in her diary.
Then you know more than I do.
Didn't know; uh-
Didn't know Tessa kept a diary.
Well, I think Tessa was right then, Tim.
You don't know everything.
I know where you're going
on Tuesday.
Next, please.
Sorry about the weather.
It's hardly your fault.
Oh, dear. We've had some forgeries
on the diplomatics.
I'm gonna have to keep this,
I'm afraid, sir.
- What?
- The F.C.O. Will issue you
with a new one in a few days.
What if I want to travel with it?
Just two, three days at the most.
Are you saying that's a forgery?
It does happen; sir;
even on diplomatics.
But that was issued to me a year ago
by the diplomatic office-
Sir, the F.C.O. Will take care of that.
It's just here on the right.
Good afternoon, sir.
Good afternoon.
Let me take that for you.
Oh, I'd rather keep it with me.
Uh; club rule; Justin.
I'm sorry.
No- No luggage in the, uh-
in the dining room.
Could you just tuck it into your cubbyhole,
please, Jimmy? Thank you.
Certainly, sir. Thank you, sir.
My dear fellow, what a dreadful time
you've had. Welcome home.
Thank you, Bernard.
Any, uh, plans,
or is it too soon?
Plans?
Well, holiday, visiting friends,
the million things you've always wanted
to do in the garden.
Mmm.
You're on indefinite sick leave.
Enjoy it.
I hear the, uh- the snow's
very good at Chamonix.
I don't have a passport, Bernard.
They took mine at the airport.
Oh, of course, yes.
You missed the, um-
You missed the recall.
Mmm. The sole meunière's
not bad here,
if- if you like sole.
Otherwise have it grilled.
Grilled'll be fine.
Um, no starters, I think.
You've been cleared, by the way.
Thought we'd get that bit
of unpleasantness dealt with first.
Cleared for what?
Um, of what.
Uh, murder most foul.
Seems you didn't hire
contract killers
in a den of vice after all.
Deasey is satisfied
it was a crime of passion
by our dark medical horse.
It's just a question now
of finding Bluhm.
Arnold Bluhm is gay,
Bernard.
Gay men don't rape
their women friends.
Well, I've known one or two
very savage queens in my time.
Do you no good to go poking around
under rocks, Justin.
Some very nasty things
live under rocks;
especially in foreign gardens.
Advice of a friend.
What is it that I'm not
to look into, Bernard?
Quayles have always made
reliable foreign service men.
Shouldn't be surprised
if you've still got a small
Head of Mission in your knapsack.
Challenging post.
More challenging than
dealing with Kenny Curtiss?
He's a crude sort of chap, our Kenny,
but he flies the flag for us.
He got up dear Tessa's nose, I fear.
- Yes, she wrote a report about it.
- About Kenny?
No, about Dypraxa.
Ah; that.
She expected some action to be taken,
but none was, was it?
She tell you about the letter,
or did you find it among her things?
Tucked into her diary;
perhaps?
What letter is that, Bernard?
Ramblings of an aging fart.
Senility setting in early, alas.
Naughty of her to take it though.
Very naughty indeed.
Yes, I found that.
Be grateful to have it back.
Written under stress, you understand.
Regrettable things said. Wouldn't
want it falling into the wrong hands.
Sorry, Bernard.
Are we talking about the same letter?
What's yours about?
Undying love.
Ah.
What's yours?
They're not so good grilled.
You should've had the meunière.
Ladies and gentlemen-
Ladies and gentlemen;
please keep all your belongings
with you at all times.
It's good to see you, Ham.
Sorry about the blubbing.
It's those bloody Latin genes,
you know.
It's the same old Ham.
Oh, no. No, not anymore.
God, I loved her rotten.
And she loved you rotten.
First cousins can be closer
than siblings.
I still don't understand why I let you
talk me out of going to the funeral.
It was the wrong crowd for you, Ham.
We'll have a private memorial service here.
You can blub
all your way through it.
Don't think I won't.
Hire the Abbey.
You can afford it now.
Can I?
Tess left you bloody well off.
Want to know what you're worth?
Not particularly.
Oh, I've got the keys to the Chelsea house.
Thought you might want to stay there
while you're in London.
No, I'd rather not.
Well, it's all yours.
That and her African women's charity.
Said it would get you
out of the garden.
When did she say that?
Two weeks before she died.
Look, I am ravenous.
Have you had lunch?
Yes, I have. A very civilized lunch
with Bernard Pellegrin...
who expressed an interest
in Tessa's diary.
But Tess never kept a diary.
She hated the things.
You and I know that.
Pellegrin must have been disinformed.
Tess thought she was being watched.
Didn't stop her e-mailing twice a day.
More inquiries than Google.
Look at him.
The boy is two-thirds machine.
I'm telling you; it's scary.
Mind of a computer.
Appetite of a waste disposal.
And what's the other third?
Oh, Manzini, unquestionably.
Those e-mails from Tess-
Guido helped me with them.
Company stuff. Boring.
Mm. Ownership, franchises,
that sort of thing.
I'm trying to find out
who brokered the marriage.
What marriage?
KDH and ThreeBees.
KDH make Dypraxa.
ThreeBees test it.
It's a marriage of convenience, of course.
Both in it for what they can get out of it.
That phrase about the marriage-
Is that Tess's phrase or yours?
Oh, hers. Hers.
Producing dead offspring.
Oh, this is so good!
Why don't you try some.
It looks disgusting.
I can get that stuff
through her mirror server.
Well, how do you do that?
All you need is the password. Duh.
Yeah, but I don't have her password.
Come on, Jus.
Five letters. Three guesses.
- I have no idea.
- My name- Guido.
She used the one for the "l"
and the zero for the "O."
- I set it up for her.
- Wait, wait.
- Give him a chance to read it.
- Lightning tour. I'm printing as I go.
What's Hippo?
Oh; I know that one.
German- German Pharma Watch.
Keep an eye on what
the drug companies are up to.
Copy that.
KDH. Can we open that?
Sure. No problem.
A new plague is sweeping the world.
In the 21 st century, multi-resistant
T.B. Will kill one in three.
- But now there is hope.
- It's huge, isn't it?
KDH is developing a revolutionary
treatment for T.B. Sufferers.
It's global.
We call it Dypraxa.
You will call it life.
And I call it a blockbuster.
Karel Delacourt Hudson.
The world is our clinic.
It's gonna sell like hotcakes.
- Can you magnify that photograph?
- Magnify it? He can send it out
for doughnuts.
Is it possible to zoom in on it?
Yeah, sure.
It's Pellegrin.
Why is he there?
