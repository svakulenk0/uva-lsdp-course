The Road To Reality.
Don't wanna be going there.
Hiya.
An oasis of calm in here, mad out there.
Gorgeous day for it, though, innit?
Never been in here before.
I like your hat.
Busy?
Hello?
Having a bad day?
No.
Oh. Not till I showed up, eh?
Look like a rabbit caught in the headlights.
Don't worry, I'm going now.
Have a good day. Stay happy.
I ain't nicked nothing. Honest, guv'nor.
Beep, beep, beep, beep.
Oh, no, no, come on.
That's just brilliant, that is.
Oh, no, I didn't even get a chance
to say goodbye.

The music's stopped.
It stopped ages ago.
Yeah, I was just enjoying the silence.
What's so funny?
-
- I don't know!
Can you just...
Oh, your sister's woken up, Poppy.
POPPY:
Oh, bless him!
Don't you ever pray that you're adopted, Suzy?
Oh, argh!
- Yeah.
-
You got me, Zoe.
- Ssssh!
- Who are you shushing?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
She's right. Let's all enjoy the silence together.
Dawn, will you shut up?
Because no-one else can get a word in.
-
Sorry!
- Sssssh.
- Fingers on lips.
Fingers on the tits.
- Fingers on tits.
- Fingers on the hips.
Can I borrow yours?
- Fingers on the tits.
- Oh, that is properly disgusting.
Chicken fillets. Lunch, anyone?
- Oh, hello!
Of course you can, Dawn, you don't need to ask.
- Anyone over there?
- Oh, I know where that's been.
You have gone down in my estimation.
I'm sorry, Alice.
- I don't get why you wear them, Poppy.
- Oh, don't you?
I mean, you just put them in your bra...
Yeah?
I like the way they make me feel, Suzy.
- Like a natural woman.
- I think it's in the wrong place.
- Ah, whoop!
Oh, look, you've got three tits!
She's like you, Zoe.
- No, that's three nipples.
Have you got three nipples?
She doesn't like to talk about it.
I'm going to give her a little hug.
- Over you go.
- Oh, that's quite nice. Do that again.
Oh, really? Oh!
Ooh!
Your cleavage looks great from up here.
- Thank you.
- I've got a bird's eye view.
Come on, ladies, cop a load of this.
Oh, yeah, roll up, roll up.
Look at that!
- It's good, isn't it?
- They're amazing.
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
I think we know where Poppy's sleeping tonight.
Morning.
Time to get up, sleepyhead.
Cup of tea here.
Come on. You can do it.
That's it. That's it, nearly there.
Oh, here we go.
- And she's up! Hey.
- Thanks.
You all right?
Yeah, I slept good.
I heard you.
You always start that.
- I don't snore.
- I know. You never have.
- I don't.
-  I don't.
- Are they still asleep?
- No, they buggered off ages ago.
- Did they?
- Yeah.
Oh, right.
- What's the time?
- About 10 past 12.
- They've got a bit of work to do.
- Have they?
- Dawn's late with her dissertation.
- Oh, no. When are your exams?
- Three weeks tomorrow.
- You'll be all right.
Yeah. I'm totally chilled out about it.
Of course you are.
- I'm cool.
- Yeah.
I'm just really stressed.
What? Like an Eskimo with a headache?
- Does anyone want any toast?
SUZY:
- Yes, please.
- With marmalade, two slices.
Yeah, I know, cut on the diagonal.
- Yeah.
- No crusts.
- Got it. Oh, do you know what?
- Oh, yeah.
- She's gone.
The thing is, we're starting with criminal justice.
- Is that your first exam?
- Yeah, it's crap.
If we had cyber crime first,
or, like, crime and pleasure,
I could ease myself into it.
- No probs.
- Oh, you'll be all right, Suzy.
Yeah, if we can get a degree, any idiot can.
- You calling your sister an idiot?
- Calling you an idiot.
Thank you.
"Crime and pleasure", now that sounds good.
- Sounds like last night.
- Yeah.
You'll be all right.
Yeah.
- See you later.
- Alligator.
- When are we going to see Helen?
- Yeah, when's the baby due?
Don't know, soon. She's been texting me.
- Me too, she's getting worse.
- I know, bless her.
- Want to wait till after your exams?
- I want to get it over with.
All right. Don't worry, leave her to me.
- Text me, yeah?
- Work hard.
Suze... you know it's that way, don't you?
- Oh, yeah.
-
- These make good legs?
- Great.
# I'm so excited...
- It would be amazing to fly, wouldn't it?
- You reckon?
Just... whoosh!
- What? Like Mr Vertigo?
- Oh, yeah. I love that book.
- Yeah.
- Oh, vultures.
- Met a few of them.
- These could be useful.
Oh, yeah, they're great.
Oh, look at him, he's gorgeous.
We could do an owl, they've got big heads.
Good idea. He's got your eyes, look.
- Cheers, Poppy.
- No, they're lovely.
Do penguins emigrate?
What? Do they move to the Costa del Sol?
Emigrate, migrate, whatever.
- What about parrots?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.
- Or a toucan. Oh, look at his beak.
Beautiful.
So, are you going to get another bike?
Oh, no, I couldn't replace my old lovely.
It's flown the nest now.
Definitely going to learn to drive, though.
- Going to book lessons?
- Might do.
Might not.
I told you, you're not learning to drive in my car.
- Nutter.
-
- Chickens, we could do chickens.
- Chickens don't fly.
buggers.
What are we going to make, then?
- I don't know. What do you think?
- I don't know.
- Where are they?
- Here.
- That far apart, are they?
- Yeah. Don't poke me.
Wasn't going near you.
- Go on, then.
- Great.
You should ask an adult to help you.
I don't know any.
- I think they're quite good.
- Yeah, what do you reckon?
- I think we could pull in these.
- Pub?
- Yeah, hair of the dog.
I'm ready. Put a bit of lippy on and away we go.
- Hi,
- Hi, Zoe. How are you?
Ooh.
Didn't expect that one!
Morning, Tina.
Birds that live here in North America,
they fly all the way to South America.
Yeah?
But the... the biggest journey of them all
is of the arctic tern.
Because he flies from the Arctic...
Yeah? ...all the way - wow,
across the world - to the South Pole.
Isn't that incredible?
From the North to the South Pole
and that is... ssh!
And that is 9,300 miles. That's right.
Wow, wow.
All right, Nick, do the other side now.
What we can do... Shall we give him...
Shall we give him a few bits?
Do you want to give him... I like that, I like that.
- He's got eyebrows, look.
-
- Yeah?
I think that's brilliant. That's brilliant.
Here we go.
Shall I put some more yellow in that?
There we go.
See, you could do a rainbow colour.
That's a good idea, isn't it?
- I did a rainbow.
- Do a rainbow. Rainbows like parrots.
Little bit more. What about the fringing?
You could do a bit more
on the fringing there, couldn't you?
Hungry? It's going to be lunch time soon.
But I'm not a cook.
It's lunch time in a minute.
We're going to lunch in a minute.
You can wash your hands.
- Who's ready?
-
Hey!
Oh, wow! That is fantastic. Look at you go!
Whooh! Flap your arms. Flap your wings.
Bit dangerous, innit?
What?
Putting these over their heads.
I'm trying to suffocate them.
That's my goal. Little buggers.
- They look great.
- Crap.
- Oh, no, why's that, then?
I didn't do much, just stayed in, really.
It's the weekend, Tash.
- I know. I had a run-in with my mum.
Mm. My sister was working Saturday.
I had to look after Jasmine.
- How is she?
- That girl eats too much.
Bless her.
She ate three chicken legs and four jam tarts
and then wants to tell me she's starving.
The little piglet.
- I dropped her off to my mum's.
I said you've got to tell Sherryanne
that she needs to put this girl on a diet.
You'll give her a complex, she's 7.
All of a sudden Mum doesn't want to get
involved, for the first time in her life.
Then I'm just leaving the house
and my two aunts arrive from Dollis Hill.
Oh, no.
So we get the Spanish Inquisition.
"Tash, you got a boyfriend?
Are you getting married soon? Why don't you
give your mother another grandchild?
You know she nearly 60. She getting old."
Aargh!
I was, like, "I haven't got a boyfriend.
I won't be getting married soon,
and, no, I won't be investing
in a mortgage in the near future,
thank you very much."
- Then I just closed the door and left.
- End of.
- You cooking?
- Yeah, are you cooking?
I'm cooking with gas. What we having?
- Food.
- That makes a change.
- Are you hungry?
- I'm ravishing.
- Aren't you just.
- Thank you.
How did it go today?
What, with my flying flock of feathered friends?
Good, they loved it. Flapping away they were.
- Were they?
- Yeah, bless them.
I had to nip it in the bud with my lot
before they flew out the window.
It was OK, though, was it?
Oh, yeah, I played them Stravinsky after lunch
just to calm them down.
- What did you play?
- The Rite Of Spring.
I booked my first driving lesson.
- Did you?
- Yeah.
- When is it?
- 12 o'clock, Saturday.
Excellent, well done you.
- I'll set the table.
- Yeah, it's nearly ready.
POPPY: Yeah, I know.
ZOE:
- I do, actually.
- Do you?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
You know I take this dance class
on a Friday afternoon, the golden time.
- That's not hard, though, is it, eh, titch?
- No, I don't mean taller, I mean wider.
You want to be careful, you know?
You don't want the kids jumping about
expressing themselves. A bit dangerous.
Yeah, you do all that on Friday,
but then they spend the weekend indoors,
glued to their Nintendo DS.
Totally. A couple of weeks ago
I came in Monday -
I told Poppy - sat the kids down for carpet time,
asked them what they did over the weekend.
They'd all been sitting at home
on their PlayStations.
- You couldn't get them up off the carpet.
- When they got up, they were wheezing.
- That's pollution for you.
- We always used to go to the park.
- Yeah, exactly.
But you don't need a park to go for a walk.
If Mum and Dad don't go out, the kids don't.
Parents are too frightened
to let their kids play out.
Even a bit of green by the estate,
they don't let them play there.
But it's hard for a lot of mums and dads, isn't it?
They've had a hell of a week.
They're under pressure and stress.
- Tell me about it.
You know. A lot of them are
single mums, they're exhausted.
It's understandable if they don't take
their kids out for a lovely picnic.
It's not acceptable. Life's hard, but if
you want to find a way you find it, innit?
- Yeah, I know.
So instead they let their kids
stay up half the night on chat rooms.
- Yeah!
- Yeah, that's worrying.
- Scary.
- Makes me so angry.
A lot of seven-year-olds know more
about the internet than we do.
At least people are talking about it. That's good.
- Is it?
- Well, yeah. It means we're aware.
I'm aware smoking's bad for me.
It doesn't mean I'll stop.
- As long as you know what will kill you.
Any time.
I know drinking's bad for me,
but, you know... I can't help myself.
- Oh, shame.
- Cheers!
Cheers, everyone! Here's to our livers
and all who drown in them.
Careful, Poppy, you got your first
driving lesson tomorrow.
Oh, yeah, quick, put that down.
You don't want to mess up your blind spot.
- Oh, that sounds good.
- Oh, it's here. How many fingers?
- That must be for you.
-  I'm so excited!
You should do some deep breathing
before you get in the car.
Ooh, can't see him. Wish me luck.
Good luck. I'll keep the emergency
services on standby.
Hello. Scott?
- Are you Poppy?
- That's me. Nice to you meet you.
Right, the car's just here.
They're not infected! What are you like?
They're clean, I just washed them specially,
honest.
- This it?
- You get in the passenger seat.
- You know it's me learning to drive?
- We have to talk a few things through.
Oh, have we? Fair enough. If you insist.
- Did you choose this colour car?
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you. Is this your car?
- No, it's the company's car.
- Oh, right, what's your car like, then?
- It is my car.
You said it was the company's car.
Make your mind up.
- Have you got your provisional licence?
- Yep!
There you go. That's me on a bad day.
- Is that your real name, Pauline?
- Right.
- OK, everything seems to be in order.
- Does it? That's good.
Now, have you ever had
a driving lesson before?
Yeah. No, it wasn't really a lesson.
It was in a Cadillac in Miami.
Bunny-hopped down the beach.
I was a bit pissed, it was hilarious.
We won't be pissed when driving this car, OK?
We're not going to bunny-hop.
We'll focus and concentrate.
I'm going to take you to a spot
we take all learner drivers.
- Are you?
- We'll go through the cockpit drill.
- Oh, naughty.
- You'll listen and take responsibility.
I'll see what I can do.
- OK. Put your seat belt on.
- Will do, Captain Scott.
Here we go, gigolo.
- So you spoke to the office?
- I spoke to your boss.
He's not my boss, I work for myself.
I'm my own man.
But it's his car... or it's your car... Someone.
And they told you the price - £22.50 an hour?
That's right. Cheap as chips, you lot.
- We may be cheap but we're better.
You go with the big companies,
they use inexperienced instructors.
They don't?
Bastards.
Us experienced instructors, we go
with small companies and charge less.
- That makes a lot of sense, that does.
Yeah, it is. You're right. Bang-on!
So, do you want the same time every week?
Go on, then.
- Do you or don't you? I need to know.
- Well, if you need to know.
If it's good for you, it's good for me, Scott.
OK, 12 o'clock every Saturday.
- Do you like working Saturdays?
- I only work half day, Saturday.
- Oh, that's good.
- You're my last pupil.
What do you do for the rest of the day?
Are you going out tonight?
I shall go home and read my book.
Oh, it must be a good book. What is it?
It's a book.
Yeah, well, we worked that much out.
- You see three pedals in front of you.
- Yeah, yeah.
Will you put your left foot on the left-hand pedal
and push it all the way down?
He's a bit frisky, isn't he?
OK, Pauline.
Please take your boot off the pedal.
Nobody's called me Pauline
since I was two years old. Makes me laugh.
What am I supposed to call you?
- Oh, how about Poppy?
- Poppy?
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
No, whatever turns you on, Scott. I don't mind.
OK, Poppy. Your boots are inappropriate
for a driving lesson.
- What's wrong with them?
- You can't control a car in high heels.
I can do a lot in these.
You should see me in these on a dance floor.
- They may be good on a dance floor.
- Not just good on a dance floor.
They are "Oooh".
They may be good in a Cadillac on a beach
when you're pissed with your boyfriend,
but they're not suitable for driving.
You're funny.
Now, next week
I want you to bring flat-soled shoes.
- I don't look any good in them.
- It's not how you look, it's how you drive.
I'll see what I can rustle up for you, Scott.
Leave it to me.
Right, you see three mirrors -
your two side-view mirrors
and your rear-view mirror.
- They make a golden triangle.
- Is that like the pubic triangle?
It's a pyramid and at the top of it
you see the all-seeing eye - Enrahah.
Can you repeat that, please? "En-ra-hah".
- You talking about the eye of Lucifer?
- No!
Cos I don't know if I want to look in there,
thank you.
It's not Lucifer. There are
two fallen angels before Lucifer.
- There is Enrahah, Raziel and Lucifer.
- I don't have them in my phone book.
- Bear with me.
- Where is he?
- Bear with me.
- I can't see him.
- It's a teaching tool.
- Is it?
Let me explain something to you about teaching.
The teacher's job is to bring out good habits
in the pupil and to get rid of bad habits.
He does that through
frequent repetitive thinking.
And he does that by creating clear
and distinct images
that are easy for the pupil to retain.
- Oh, does he, now?
- Yes.
Don't worry, it's burnt in there.
You remember. You will remember
Enrahah till the day you die
and I will have done my job.
Why don't you have something nice up there
like a giant strawberry?
Believe you me, it works.
- OK, stop!
- What am I doing now?
Please take your hand off the gear.
Off the gear stick!
- All right.
- Foot off the pedal.
- I'm not touching anything.
- Let me explain to you something.
This car is my livelihood.
This car is how I earn my living.
- I don't know how you earn your living.
- Yeah.
But if I walked into your pub
or your discotheque or your club
and I walked up to the DJ
and I scratched all his records,
or I smashed all the glasses,
and I said, "I'm sorry, I didn't know
what I was doing," that wouldn't be acceptable.
There is only one problem with that.
I don't own a bar or a disco.
I'm just a primary school teacher.
- Are you?
- Afraid so, kiddo.
Are you a Satanist, Scott?
- No, in fact I'm exactly the opposite.
- Are you the Pope, then?
- That's the same thing.
- Is it? Does he know that?
Right, you have three pedals, A, B, C.
Accelerator, brake and clutch.
# Talking about...
Lovely.
- Good.
- Yeah.
ZOE: What's he like?
- You'd love him.
- Would I?
He made me laugh. He was funny.
What? Like funny "Ha ha" or funny peculiar?
- Bit of both, actually.
- So, what happened, then?
- He shouted at me.
- What? He gave you a telling off?
He's a little bit uptight. Just a little bit.
- Bet you wound him up.
- Might set you up with him.
- Is he fit?
- Yeah.
No, he's not fit at all. Just your type.
SUZY: What do I get out of it?
- You get a shag whenever you want.
When was the last time that happened?
Who's fault's that, eh?
Where are you going? Suzy!
- You all right?
- All right?
- What's going on?
- Come on.
- You shouting at my little sister?
- No.
- Doesn't look like it, does it?
- Poppy!
- Where are you going?
- Fuck off!
Not coming with us, apparently. Adios.
POPPY: Suze!
Ooh.
- Morning, Poppy.
- All right?
- What's the matter?
- Buggered my back, haven't I?
- Looks like it.
- Trampolining.
- Trampolining? Really?
- Yeah, I go every week.
- What? After school?
- I love it.
Great.
You've got to keep the muscles a-pumping.
- Cos I've just started flamenco.
- You haven't?
- It's fantastic.
- I've always wanted to do it. Bit of that.
- Careful.
- I'm all right.
- Come along, if you want.
- When is it?
Every Tuesday, 6:30.
- Well, see how you feel.
- All right.
- Morning, Leanne.
- Morning.
POPPY: Stink of urine round here.
- I can't smell anything.
- Have you peed your pants?
Yeah, sorry.
- You're a naughty girl.
- Tell me about it.
Ow!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Come on, we're nearly there.
- Have you lost your sense of smell?
- Yeah, smoking dulls your senses.
- And your brain. Here we go.
- Go on, then.
Done that.
- All done?
- Yeah, thanks.
OK.
Take care.
- OK, who have we got next?
- Poppy Cross.
Thanks.
Poppy? No, I'm Zoe. Nice to meet you.
No, I'm Poppy, sorry about her.
Don't know who she is.
- My name's Ezra.
- Hello, Ezra.
- You want to just follow me upstairs?
- Yeah.
- You're big, aren't you?
ZOE: Good luck!
- Just take your time.
- What are you going to do to me?
Ooh!
Makes me laugh.
OK, I'm just going to feel the muscles
in your back.
- Right.
- And you let me know where the pain is.
I'll send you a text.
Strong fingers.
That tickles.
- Oooh! Bang on the money.
- OK.
- Ow...
- And this side?
Yeah.
OK. Do you want to reach down to your side
as if you're picking something up?
Picking chickens.
No, sorry. I can't do that. Ow! Oooh.
Is it your back?
Sorry?
Cos it can affect everything, can't it?
Like your mood and everything.
- Nice action.
- Lie on your back for me, please.
Must get one of these. Come in very handy.
Oooh! Ow.
OK, I'm just going to ask you to roll
yourself onto your side, facing me.
You don't ask for much do you, eh?
I'm going to feel the muscles in your spine again.
Ooh.
Oh!
# What-d'you-ma-call-it,
ding dang dilly dilly da da, hoo-hoo!
OK.
All right, lie back.
There we go.
There's a joint in your spine that's jammed up.
Oh, no.
- Would you like me to release it?
- Is it serious?
- It's not too bad.
- What you going to do? Will it hurt?
It may for a few days.
- Go on, then. Go for your life.
If you're quick.
OK. I'm going to roll you over and you'll
feel a short sharp click in your back.
OK? Breathe in. And...
Oh. Wait a minute.
OK. Are you ready?
Yeah.
- OK, breathe in...
-
- OK.
- And release.
- Oh, hoochy coochy ga-la!
OK. Just relax for me.
Didn't know you were going to do that.
Ooh.
-
Yeah.
Will this be a regular occurrence,
chopping and changing?
- Sorry, Scott. Something came up.
- I've got a life too, you know.
- I had to make an appointment.
- Isn't this an appointment?
I couldn't help it.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
Sounds like fun.
Having a bad day, are you?
- I had a bad pupil this morning.
He was late, he refused to pay his money.
He slammed the door and swore at me.
- You shout at him, did you?
- You show him.
- He's rude, he's arrogant,
- he's overconfident and he's too street.
-
You don't like that.
He's been overindulged
and encouraged to express himself.
Express himself! Chop his hands off!
- Go on.
- How little do they know.
How little do their mothers know.
And they smell.
It's not easy being you, is it? Eh?
Fancy meeting you here, hey?
You don't have to laugh, I'll let you off.
OK, gently, gently, gently, gently.
- Steady progression.
- Sorry.
Take your foot off the brake.
There's no need to put your foot on the brake.
- Do you know what's doing that?
- What is doing that?
- Your boots. Your boots are doing that.
- No, I was taking my time.
- I panicked.
- Your boots, they're inappropriate.
OK, on.
Poppy, come on.
Let's pick up some speed. OK?
- Don't shout at me, Scott.
- I'm just learning.
- Next left-hand turn. OK?
- You panic me.
- So, mirror, signal, manoeuvre.
- Gets me right there.
Both hands on the wheel, Enrahah. Enrahah.
I don't like that, gives me the creeps.
- Indicate.
- How am I doing?
- Foot down on the brake. Clutch.
You don't want to stall. OK, find your biting point
and peep and creep.
- First gear. Peep and creep.
- First gear.
- Peep and creep.
- Peeping and a-creeping.
- When you get to the end of the road...
- Ooh, he's nice.
When we get to the end of the road...
Can you please focus on the driving?
Enrahah, Enrahah.
- Enrahah. OK!
- No.
- OK, put the hand brake on.
Find your biting point.
OK, lock your door. Lock your door.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Poppy, there's two of them.
- OK, let's go. Let's go, Poppy, let's go.
- I don't believe you just said that.
Let's go. On you go. On you go.
- Let's go that way.
- Poppy! Poppy, let's go!
- We're on a bend. Now, let's go.
- Blimey, O'Reilly.
Right, on you go. Keep to the left
of the centre of the road.
Usual time next week? 12 o'clock?
You can check it if you like.
See you.
Cheerio.
All right, doggie?
ZOE: Here's another one.
POPPY:
Circle, completely red.
What? Like a tomato?
For instance. White horizontal line.
Give us a clue, Zoe.
Horizontal, parallel to the horizon.
Thank you, Miss Marsh.
- You're welcome.
- So, it's not... up and down like a yoyo.
- No.
- Right.
- What is it?
- Vertical.
- No, you muppet, the sign.
- That'd be "no entry".
- For what?
- For black boys on bicycles.
- Don't get me started on that again.
- It just popped out of his mouth.
- You can always get another instructor.
- Yeah, I know. See how it goes, eh?
- Ask me another.
- This is also a red circle.
- Yeah.
- Black car - this isn't a racist thing.
- Glad to hear it.
- Next to the black car is a red car.
That's Mr Golly overtaking Noddy.
- Enrahah.
- Enrahah to you.
- What is it?
- No overtaking.
- Enrahah.
- Enrahah-ha-ha!
- He sounds like a nutter.
- He is a nutter.
- How's your back?
- It's all right, actually. He sorted it.
Magic fingers. He was sweet, wasn't he?
He was fit.
Octagonal sign with "stop" written in it.
- Stop!
- All right, then.
Who's going to blink first?
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Yes, please.
No, you have the lasagna tonight.
We can finish the chicken tomorrow.
Look, I can't talk now. See you later.
- Do you think we'll make it?
- Depends on the traffic.
Should be all right. Ooh, that's my back!
Hey, come in, ladies, as quick as you can.
- Sorry we're late.
- Sorry.
No problem, it's very Spanish to be late.
Take your places. Then we can start.
Here.
I was just introducing myself
to the peoples what don't know me.
It's lovely to see you again
and lovely you bring a friend.
Welcome in my class.
So, my name is Rositta Santos
and I'm coming from Sevilla in Spain.
Or Seville, what you say here.
our beautiful oranges -
what your English peoples
turn into disgusting marmalade.
And also is the birth home of flamenco.
Sorry.
Then everybody is ready... I hope.
Pulling up from the waist.
Opening across the chest.
Arms relaxed.
And taking the head over to your right.
Then to the left.
Not very flamenco, is it?
So, guys. We're going to reverse the abs now.
Right foot in front.
Lifting, lifting.
Keeping the shoulders down.
Arms above the head.
Then bringing the arms down in front.
Pressing, pressing, pressing.
Then lifting up again from the elbows.
Like the eagle spreading his wings.
And, guys, when you're lifting up
your eagle wings,
of los gitanos...
erm... what you say, "the gypsies".
I know this word not politically correct,
but these guys,
they been squashed down by society
"We don't need this. We got pride.
We got dignity.
We got heart. We got flamenco."
They say, "This... my space."
My space.
My space. Everybody... do this. One, two.
ALL: My space.
-
- And again.
- My space!
- Vamos! Vamos!
- My space!
- And again.
- My space!
- My space!
- With meaning.
- My space!
But, guys.
My space!
- One more time.
- My space!
- With expression.
- My space!
- I don't believe it.
- My space!
Guys, guys, guys. What are you doing?
Where is the passion? Where is the revenge?
Where is the blood?
This is flamenco.
That clapping, so polite.
It's like the end of the opera.
"Excuse me, how many sugar
you want in your tea?"
This woman been spending
every Wednesday afternoon for a year
with your husband, in a hotel in Paddington.
This guy been having an affair
for five years with your best friend.
Your boyfriend, what you gave your love,
your spirit, for five years
betrays you with a Swedish bitch,
what is 22 years old.
You want to kill him.
You want to cut off his balls.
He's such a bastard! I hate him!
Are you all right?
Didn't bargain for that. That was something else.
I know, but all credit to her.
She picked herself up. She came straight back.
As if nothing had happened.
Like a little fireball, wasn't she?
- Not a grain of sentimentality.
- No, wipe the tears.
Bless her. I wanted to give her a hug.
I don't think she'd appreciate that.
No! "This is my space, get off me!"
Leaves a nasty taste, though,
exploding her heart all over the floor.
- Then it was "put that away".
- Stick that in a box.
- Get it out another time.
- Perhaps never.
- I know.
She must be going through some shit,
though, mustn't she?
- She's actually a good teacher.
She's going to burn herself out.
I believed her when she said
she'd cut off his balls, though. Didn't you?
I don't expect the guys will be back
next week, then?
No! Snip, snip.
- How's your love life?
- How is my love life?
- Not a sausage.
- Are you OK with that?
- Oh, yeah.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
- How's your Beth?
- Darren's dumped her.
Oh, no.
Just before her 18th birthday. "Thanks, Darren."
- Why do men always do that, eh?
Christmas, Valentine's Day.
Boom! They're gone.
- I hope he won't turn up to the party.
- Name off the list.
I'm looking at her and thinking,
"Don't call him. Don't call him."
- "Don't do it, Beth. Don't do it."
- You can't say anything, though.
- You've got to let them get on with it.
- You can't help being protective.
Of course, she's got her A levels coming up.
Fingers crossed, she's going to Manchester.
- Fantastic. What she want to do there?
- Sociology.
- Lovely.
- I hope she'll take a gap year. Travel.
That's important, see the world.
- I think so. Cos I never got the chance.
- Nor me.
- You made up for it later, though.
- Didn't I just?
- Where were you?
Taught in this school in Thailand, six months.
Me and Zoe.
Started off in Australia.
Zoe's got relations in Melbourne and Sydney.
Bali, Java, Malaysia, Vietnam - beautiful.
Then Thailand.
Fabulous.
Amazing. Gorgeous kids.
Loved learning. 60 in a class.
- 60?
Fantastic. Great challenge.
- And for them.
Yeah.
- Do you want another one?
Oh, of course you are.
Got to be good. Work tomorrow.
Poppy, this is your third driving lesson.
- I'm getting quite good, aren't I?
You're smug. You're too easily distracted.
You're distracted by squirrels,
by dogs, by children in the park,
by old ladies in surgical stockings,
by half-naked men in their gardens.
- Oh, well, he was quite fit, wasn't he?
- No, he wasn't fit, he had a paunch.
- Keep your eyes focused on the road.
This car is a lethal weapon.
Pay attention or you'll kill somebody.
Keep to the left of the centre of the road.
Oh, come on, Scott. How often do you
see a squirrel sending a text like that?
- Sending a little text.
Enrahah!
I can't believe you're a teacher,
that you're in charge of 40 children.
It took me by surprise, to be honest. It's 30.
You are arrogant, you are disruptive
and you celebrate chaos.
- I slipped through the net, didn't I?
Believe you me, Poppy, you are the net.
OK, we're going to do the next left turn.
Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.
- Enrahah. Keep with it, Poppy.
- Oooh. Don't like this corner.
Get away from the bend.
Get away from the bend.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Do you remember the shape of the pyramid?
- No.
Enrahah is the eye at the top of the pyramid.
I'm talking about the bottom of it.
Those at the bottom of the pyramid
are kept in total ignorance
of what those at the top of the pyramid
are achieving. Enrahah.
Where are you on the pyramid?
- I'm outside the pyramid, looking in.
- Of course you are.
Where are you? That is more to the point.
Where are you and your children?
- Where are we all, eh?
- Did you like school, Scott?
- I'm afraid it didn't agree with me.
Oh, that's a shame.
Let me tell you something
about the education system.
- Oh, go on, then.
- It produces left brain prisoners.
- Do you know what that means?
- I do.
Well, I'll tell you. Our brain has two sides.
The left brain and the right brain.
The left brain... Keep going, keep going.
The left brain is information, data. It's dead.
The right brain is individuality.
It's where the soul lies.
And the education system, it works like this -
"I will give you a world view.
And if you repeat my world view,
if you reconfirm my world view,
you will pass your exams and you will
go higher and higher and higher
and you will become a policeman, a magistrate,
a lawyer, a general, a politician,
and you will be happy and you will succeed.
But if you think for yourself,
if you think outside of the box,
then you will be unhappy and you will fail."
That's how the education system works.
Left turn. Enrahah. Signal. Enrahah.
Were you bullied at school, Scott?
We're going to do the next left turn. Enrahah.
Kids, they can be cruel, can't they, eh?
Nick!
Nick, what's going on? Eh?
- Are you all right, Charlie?
-
Yeah, I could see that. What's going on, eh?
ROSITTA:
Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.
Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.
Bravo, everybody.
I have to tell you, I am slightly impressed.
Much better than last week.
Though of course this is not difficult.
And still could improve.
For now.

POPPY:
That's lovely, Savannah.
There we are. You carry on
with your work, there's a good...
Yeah, you carry on. You draw a picture now.
Hold on. What's going on?
Can you stop that, please?
What is happening? Are you hurting Ayotunde?
Are you all right? He hurt you hard?
He hit you? Come here.
We do not hurt our friends.
You come and sit over here.
Get on with your work.
You were hurting Ayotunde for no reason.
That's not very nice.
That's not what we do to our friends.
- I can't do these.
- Yes, you can. You carry on with that.
- Miss, I've got a tiger fish.
- OK, Chelsea.
What's happening here, eh?
You can talk to me, you know?
I'm here to help you.
Because I'm your mate, aren't I?
-  Yes.
- Yeah, that's right.
That's what mates do...
...isn't it?
- Yeah.
What's making you so angry?
I want to help sort this out.
Come on, chop chop.
- Hi, Jenny.
- Hi, Poppy.
- Poppy.
- Have you got a minute?
- What's up?
- I think I might have a problem.
- Come in. Sit yourself down.
- Cheers.
It's Nick, really...
