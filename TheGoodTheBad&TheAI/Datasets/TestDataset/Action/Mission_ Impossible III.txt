DAVIAN: We've put
an explosive charge
in your head.
Does that sound familiar?
The Rabbit's Foot.
Where is it?
I gave it to you.
Ethan,
where's the Rabbit's Foot?
Wait... What--
What are you saying?
That wasn't it?
What I gave you,
was that...
I'm going to count to 10.
You're going to tell me
where the Rabbit's Foot is
or she dies.
Jules, it's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.
Do you understand?
One.
You listen to me.
I got exactly
what you asked for.
Did you want something else?
If there was a misunderstanding,
I will fix it.
I can get it,
whatever you want.
Two.
Listen. Talk to me.
We--We can talk,
like gentlemen.
Three.
God!
All right.
All right, all right.
I know where
the Rabbit's Foot is.
I can help you.
The way you helped me
on the airplane?
That way?
You put the gun down.
I'm not talking to you
like this.
That's your choice. Four.
The Rabbit's Foot's in Paris.
You want to know
where in Paris?
Then let her go.
'Cause you will not...
It's not in Paris. Five.
I can get it for you.
But you kill her,
you do this,
you get nothing.
Six.
Are you listening to me?
The only way you're going
to get what you want
is for you to...
Do you think I'm playing?
Son of a bitch!
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?
DAVIAN: Where is it?
Where the hell is it?
Look at me.
Look at me.
Where the hell is it?
Stay with me.
Seven! Seven!
I am going to kill you.
I swear to God
I'm going to kill you!
Eight!
No, please.
Please. Don't do this.
Just let her go.
I promise you.
I promise you.
I can figure out
how to get whatever...
Nine.
Listen to me. Listen to me.
I want to help you.
I want to help you get
whatever you want.
But you got to do
what's right.
What you know is right.
No. No.
No.
Ten.
Don't!
What are you doing?
Your brother wants
another one.
Oh, God, no. Ethan,
that's what we talked about...
I'm watching him.
He's fine.
That's how it is with Rick.
He's fine and then
suddenly he's naked
and he's hugging everybody.
I'll take full
responsibility for Rick.
You will? Full?
Well, mostly full.
It's a huge responsibility.
It's going well, right?
It's going really well. Yeah.
Julia,
your sister's here.
Give me a hug.
You look so beautiful.
I don't know about that.
So, is this him?
I hope so.
Oh, come here. Oh, gosh.
All right.
Mom's dying to see you.
JULIA: I can't believe
you guys came
all the way to Virginia.
RACHAEL: Like we'd miss
your engagement...
When Julia called and told me
that she was getting married,
I had one thought,
that it was just too bad
that Daddy wasn't here
to walk her down the aisle.
And then when Julia told me...
Thanks, Mom.
That Ethan doesn't have
his parents anymore, either,
I got really sad.
But it occurred to me
that this is about
starting a new family
and how beautiful that is.
And I just want to say
I am making Julia an aunt,
so I expect the same treatment
very, very soon.
Cheers!
KEVIN:
Department of Transportation?
I've been there
over 10 years now. Wow.
What do you do
at the DOT?
I study traffic patterns.
You hit the brakes
for a second,
just tap them on the freeway,
you can literally track
the ripple effect
of that action
across a 200-mile
stretch of road,
because traffic has a memory.
It's amazing.
It's like a living organism.
Freshen that up for you?
What is it, vodka martini?
Yeah. Thanks.
Ladies, do you need...
I'd marry him.
I would, too.
Okay, so, a three-week
heli-boarding honeymoon?
Okay, you actually
get dropped...
From a helicopter, yeah.
It's how they met.
ELLIE: Really?
Tell her the story.
There's no story.
It is a good story.
Tell the story.
First of all,
no one was ever
good enough for Julia.
Oh, here we go.
Not spontaneous enough, adventurous enough,
funny enough...
You know what?
No, that's not true.
You make it sound
like I've never dated.
No one we liked.
That is true.
That is true.
And wouldn't old Santa
be in trouble
if there ain't no chimney
in the house
They call me
the back door Santa
I make my runs
about the break of day
Then she goes
and gets in a chopper
that takes off
from this lake...
What was the name
of that lake?
Lake...
Lake Wanaka. Wanaka.
Wanaka. Thank you.
He heard that?
How did he hear that?
ASHLEY:
And the hospital's cool
with you taking three weeks?
Yeah, I'm not the only nurse
employed there, you know.
Doesn't take much
to make me happy
and make me smile
Never never
will I feel discouraged
I'm psyched that you're
going to be my brother, man.
So am I, Rick.
No, it's awesome.
I think it's going
to be sick.
Me, too, man.
I just got to get the phone.
You rock hard.
Okay.
Hello?
MAN: Is this Mr. Ethan Hunt?
Yes, it is.
This is Ready-Travel
Resort Services.
We'd like to offer you
a chance to win
an all-expense-paid trip
to Mexico.
We ran out of ice.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.
Oh, no.
Can't somebody else go?
No, I got it.
I'll be right back.
Hi, Betsy.
Thank you.
CASHIER: $1.86.
MUSGRAVE: Thanks for coming.
Can't decide
what size Slurpee to get.
I usually go
for the 900-ouncer.
How's that party?
Sorry I had to call you.
Yeah, you should have come.
You should have invited me.
You know I would have.
Thanks.
I know we joke about it,
but I am always this close to begging you
to stop training our people
and get your ass
back in the field.
But that's not
what you do anymore,
and so I respect that choice.
You know I do.
Family's everything.
Come on, John.
What's going on, huh?
It's Agent Farris.
She was on an operation.
She's disappeared.
Been off-grid 11 hours.
I'm sending in
Search and Rescue.
I was hoping you'd want in.
You've got good people
for that.
Yeah. Yep, that we do.
Wheels up at sunrise if you
have a change of heart.
Take some pictures
of the party for me.
MUSGRAVE: Ethan.
Three days ago,
Agent Lindsey Farris
was captured while on
a surveillance operation.
This is the man
she was tracking.
His name is Owen Davian.
Details are eyes-only,
but I can tell you
that Davian's
a black-market trafficker.
Extremely dangerous
and a priority for us.
At 1400 hours today,
a recon satellite ID'd
a caravan of vehicles
with plates matching those
known to have been used
by Davian's operatives.
They stopped at a derelict
factory outside Berlin.
It appears
they have a hostage.
We believe it's Agent Farris.
Normally we would disavow,
but Lindsey may be the key
to getting us closer
to Davian,
and that's a risk
we need to take.
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,
is to find Lindsey
and bring her home.
I've already
assembled a team.
I have them standing by,
awaiting your word.
This message,
let's call it my excellent
engagement gift to you,
will self-destruct
in five seconds.
Good luck, Ethan,
and thanks again.
LINDSEY: Am I ready?
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, I'm sorry.
I realized I didn't tell you
that the office called
during the party.
I have to go to Houston
for a night.
METRO's having
a public transpo conference.
It's so last-minute.
I know.
LUTHER: Well, well, well.
Now, if it isn't
Mr. "Those Who Can't Do,
Teach"
back in the field.
What's up, baby?
Hey, man.
Hey, Ethan, don't worry.
We're going to get the girl.
Or have you been away so long
you've forgotten
how good we are?
Welcome back, brother.
Is our truck in place?
Mmm-hmm.
?
Weapons good to go
Yeah. You?
Yeah.
You know I got your six.
Hey, man. That's your job.
COMPUTER:
Guns one, activated.
Guns two, activated.
Guns three, activated.
Guns four, activated.
Guns ready.
All four guns operational.
They've got men on the second,
third, fourth floors.
LUTHER: I count 14 of them.
Observer,
I'm in approach position.
Roger that. Stand by.
COMPUTER: Target match.
The prize is
on the sixth floor.
Two Tangos with her.
Moving in.
So, Raider One, at some point,
we got to go over this whole
"getting married" thing.
Negative, Observer.
I don't respect you
nearly enough
to have that conversation.
LUTHER:
You may not respect me,
but for now you're stuck
with my voice in your head.
So, this girl, what the hell
do you see in her anyway?
Who, Julia?
You've never met her.
Yeah, and the way things are,
I probably never will.
Lucky for her, right?
That's what you're thinking.
ETHAN: They've got
communications gear.
Two Tangos, second floor,
northwest corridor.
Groundhog, that's you.
You need to grab that gear
on the second floor
as soon as we go hot.
Copy that.
I'll need two minutes,
which means
you'll need me in one, right?
Yeah, just about.
Raider One, make a left
at the top of the stairs.
The prize should be
at the end of the hall.
Phoenix,
I have eye on the prize.
BROWNWAY:
Give her 10 cc's more.
Call me when she wakes.
GUARD: Okay.
We need touchdown in less than three.
Do you copy?
DECLAN: Roger that, I copy.
Please, when do I not copy?
All I do is copy.
Stand by to go live.
On my mark.
Three.
Two.
One. Execute.
COMPUTER: Warning. Warning.
Raider One, you're clear.
Move!
Lindsey. Lindsey.
Ethan?
I'm going to get you home.
Observer, I've got the prize.
Evac in three.
LUTHER: Roger that.
This is adrenaline. Lindsey,
you're going to feel this.
LUTHER: Groundhog,
second floor is clear.
On the move!
Observer, we're on the move.
Wrap out.
Evac in 90 seconds.
LUTHER: Roger that.
Phoenix, get to the LZ now.
Roger, Observer. On my way.
Ethan.
I have to talk to you.
Come on, come on.
I have to talk
to you right now!
Just for you.
Turn off your transmitter.
Do it, Ethan!
Ethan!
Lindsey! Moving!
LINDSEY: Moving!
Mag!
Ready to move.
We evac from here.
Get down!
I'm out.
How many rounds you got?
Enough.
Now I'm out.
T minus five, baby.
Lindsey, hold on to me.
Luther!
Rolling!
LINDSEY: God!
My head! What is that?
What is...
Is she okay?
Lindsey!
Let's get to the chopper.
Zhen, get rid of the truck.
Let's go!
God! What is that?
You can't hear that?
LINDSEY: Oh! God!
DECLAN:
What's wrong with her?
Let's go!
We loaded?
Yeah. Let's do it! Move out!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Son of a bitch.
No!
DECLAN: Guys, we got company.
I'm going to try
and lose them.
LINDSEY: Hurts so much.
Turn it off. Please.
Please, Ethan.
Guys, their missiles are hot!
Incoming! Hold on.
Okay. That was lucky.
We only get one of those.
Do we have a defibrillator?
LINDSEY: Ethan, turn it off!
Bring it on!
Ethan! What is it?
Did they put something
in my head?
They injected you
with a time-release charge.
Do you remember that?
No. Time-release...
An explosive.
They've activated it.
It's gonna detonate
unless we fry the charge,
which is what we're gonna do.
No, Ethan.
Zap her like that,
you'll stop her heart.
Then I'll zap her again
and bring her back.
Do it!
Guys!
They're firing another one!
ZHEN: Ethan!
ETHAN: Zhen!
Zhen, hold on.
Hold on, hold on!
I want you to set it for 150.
ETHAN:
Lindsey, I'm gonna short out
the explosive in your head.
You're gonna be okay.
ZHEN: It'll need 30 seconds.
Damn it.
ZHEN: Twenty-five seconds!
DECLAN: Come on.
We're almost there.
They have us locked.
Twenty seconds.
Hold on.
I got them!
Ten seconds.
Almost there. Almost there.
ETHAN: Give me the paddles.
Ethan. Thank you.
Shit.
Hey.
Hey.
How did it go?
I'm sorry. Fine. I'm sorry.
I'm just tired.
BRASSEL:
I read your training brief
on Agent Farris.
The words you used were
"beyond capable."
That still stand, Mr. Hunt?
Mr. Brassel...
Does it stand?
Yes, sir, it does.
BRASSEL: Because we've
got a corpse downstairs
that says otherwise.
Killed by a detonator
implanted in her skull
through the nasal cavity.
Mr. Brassel, it's unacceptable
to judge Agent Farris'
competence based...
It's unacceptable
that chocolate makes you fat,
but I've eaten my share.
And guess what?
Now, I approved Agent Farris'
surveillance op
based on your evaluations,
Mr. Hunt,
of a woman who allowed
herself to be captured.
So you go to recover her.
You encounter a dozen men.
You don't grab any of them?
Our objective, Mr. Brassel,
was to recover Agent Farris.
Davian employs
a cellular structure
at his organization.
The men there
more than likely
had no information...
Who's drawing
these conclusions?
Is it you?
I am, sir. Based upon...
I'm not on you yet.
You allowed Farris
to board your chopper
without a scan.
That explosive device
could have taken you all out.
There is one reason
that you are sitting here
before me today,
and that is luck.
Because your operation
was poorly conceived
and executed worse.
Two laptops
were recovered...
I'm aware of that.
We've talked
to Tech Services.
They doubt if they can
reconstitute the drives.
"Crispy," I believe,
is what they called them.
Worthless.
Mr. Brassel, as Operation
Manager of this office,
I have the authority...
Excuse me.
Did you just throw a title
at me, Mr. Musgrave?
I don't care if your daddy
plays golf with the President.
This is Intelligence.
So far I haven't seen any.
You think this op
was worth the risk,
Mr. Hunt.
What do you know
about Owen Davian?
He was the one
who brought gas
centrifuge technology
to Korea from Pakistan.
He was also the man
who sold Toxin Five
to the Armahad
Republic Jihad.
He is a man who provides,
provides, provides!
And he remains invisible.
He's a goddamn invisible man.
Wells, not Ellison,
in case you want
to be cute again.
We can't find him.
He knows it.
It's emboldened him.
I've been trying
to bring Davian down
since the day
that I got here.
Do you know what
I've got for it?
It's never been confirmed
the Toxin Five theft
was Davian.
Mr. Musgrave,
please don't interrupt me
when I'm asking
rhetorical questions.
Your operation has
achieved one thing.
You have reminded Davian
that he is winning.
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go inform
Mr. and Mrs. Farris
that their baby girl
was killed in a head-on
collision on I-95.
MINISTER: I stand here today
deeply saddened
by the death of
one of God's children,
Lindsey Elizabeth Farris.
It is always startling
when the Lord takes one
of our young so unexpectedly.
ETHAN: Be aggressive.
Come on. Stay focused.
Keep your knees bent.
Good. Good.
Now, to fire the lock,
the extractor has to be...
That bag's not
going to hit you back.
Hit harder.
Don't rely on your sights.
Keep your eyes
dead on the target...
Attack me. Come on.
Don't ever
release the firing pin
unless the extractor's...
Good. There you go. Good.
Identify the target.
Point and shoot.
It's very simple.
You point and shoot.
Stay focused.
Miss Farris, you know
how many recruits
I've trained.
I'm proud to say
that you are the first
that I've recommended
for active field duty.
Congratulations.
LINDSEY: Am I ready?
Yes?
WOMAN: Is this Mr. Kelvin?
Yes. Who is this?
I'm calling from
Norfolk Mail Service.
Lindsey Farris
rents a post office box here.
She sent you a piece
of mail from Berlin
and asked us to call you
when it arrived.
It came this morning.
Thank you.
MAN: This right here.
ETHAN: Thanks.
LUTHER: It's a microdot.
A microdot
with nothing on it.
This is unusual.
Lindsey wouldn't send me
a blank microdot.
I'm telling you, man,
there's no image.
Then you're not looking
in the right place.
Where the hell
am I supposed to look?
There's not much square
footage to this thing.
Why would Lindsey send me
a blank microdot?
I don't know.
Why would Lindsey
send you anything?
You were her instructor,
not her handler.
Listen, man. I don't mean
to cross the line,
but was there something
going on between you two?
You and Lindsey.
Lindsey was like
my little sister.
And you never
slept with your
little sister, right?
Hey, brother,
if I don't ask you, who will?
Maybe it's magnetic.
The microdot.
Well, that's old school.
If she was in a hurry
and only had access to
black-market gear, maybe.
Could you get
the tools to read it?
I might know a guy.
Magnetic means encrypted.
Yeah, I know that.
Yeah. Be right there.
The thing about Lindsey
is she was brand-new.
She was sweet.
Remember when
you were sweet?
Can you remember
that far back?
Yeah, well, barely.
In Germany,
you asked me what
it is I see in Julia.
What I see in Julia
is life before all this.
And it's good.
Benji, what have you got?
Uh, well, these hard drive
platters are just fried.
Yeah.
You know, they m-m-made--
made a mess of them.
It's just like...
There's holes in them
and stuff.
And it's got scorched
all the way through.
And then...
Look, this one's got
a hole in it and stuff.
I can't believe.
I can't even look at it.
Benji. Did you recover
anything?
Yes. Yes.
Despite the aforementioned
conditions of the hard drive
you brought back,
I managed to recover
portions of, uh,
two dozen e-mail files.
Also made
what I believe to be
a thoroughly
promotion-worthy breakthrough.
Your Mr. Davian is
going to arrive in Rome
the day after tomorrow
and attend a function
at one Vatican City.
What the hell is Davian
doing at the Vatican?
It's all got to do
with the "Rabbit's Foot."
Rabbit's Foot?
Yeah, well, I'm assuming
it's like a code word
for something
he's about to sell
to an unspecified buyer,
for $850 million, by the way.
Or maybe
it's not a code word.
Maybe it's just a really,
really expensive
bunny appendage.
You have no idea
what it is?
It's interesting.
I used to have this
professor at Oxford, okay?
Dr. Wickham, his name was,
and he was like
this massive, fat guy.
You know, huge, big guy.
We used to call him...
You know...
Well, I won't tell you
what we used to call him.
He taught
bimolecular kinetics
and cellular dynamics,
and he used to sort of
scare the underclassmen
with this story about
how the world would
eventually be eviscerated
by technology.
You see, it was inevitable
that a--a--a compound
would be created,
which he referred to
as the "Anti-God."
It was like
an accelerated mutator,
a sort of, you know,
like a-a-a-an unstoppable
force of--of--of
destructive power
that would just lay waste
to everything.
To buildings and parks
and streets and children
and ice cream parlors,
you know?
So whenever I see, like,
a rogue organization,
willing to spend
this amount of money
on a mystery tech,
I always assume
it's the Anti-God.
End-of-the-world
kind of stuff,
you know?
But, no, I don't have
any idea what it is.
I was just speculating.
Did you brief Musgrave
on this?
Who, me? No, not yet.
Good. Don't.
BENJI: What?
Don't tell anyone about this.
This took me ages.
If something goes wrong
with the operation,
I want Musgrave
to have deniability.
That's great work, Benji.
What operation?
That look in your eye
is a pain in my ass.
You know that, right?
WOMAN ON PA SYSTEM:
Any available resident
to Pediatrics.
Any available resident
to Pediatrics.
Rehabilitative Care,
call the pharmacy.
Rehabilitative Care,
call the...
I have to go away again.
On business. Two days.
Two days?
Yeah.
Ethan, what's going on?
I keep thinking
you just need time
to tell me whatever it is
that it's...
But nothing in my mind
makes sense.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
What are you not telling me?
I need-- I need to
ask you for something.
And it's the most...
I need you to trust me.
Of course I trust you.
Am I ever going to be able
to understand what this is?
I need you to trust me.
Yes.
I trust you.
Is it...
Tell me it's real.
I mean us.
Tell me it's real.
Follow me.
PRIEST: The vows
you're about to take
are not to be taken
without careful thought
and prayer.
This love is not
to be diminished
by difficult circumstances
and it is only to be
dissolved by death.
Do you have the rings?
Yeah.
Repeat after me.
I, Julia Anne Meade...
"I, Julia Anne Meade..."
...hereby take
Ethan Matthew Hunt...
"...hereby take
Ethan Matthew Hunt..."
...to be my
lawfully wedded husband.
"...to be my
lawfully wedded husband."
Tomorrow may be the only time
we can predict
where Owen Davian
is going to be.
Charity event.
Vatican City.
Our mission is to get in
and kidnap Davian.
I don't know
why he's so happy.
I did remind him
that the Vatican
is the Vatican.
A 109-acre sovereign state
in the middle of Rome,
surrounded by a 60-foot wall,
which is monitored 24/7,
with over 200 CCTV cameras.
That's not even
what makes it a challenge.
Getting Davian is good.
But getting his buyers
is even better.
If they realize
he's been grabbed,
they'll disappear.
I'm sorry,
what are you saying?
No matter how we grab Davian,
his clients are gonna know
he's been taken.
No, they won't.
Access point is here.
It's a one-way street
adjacent to the Vatican wall.
I'll need 30 seconds.
And we'll need a truck.
Now we've pissed off
every Italian in Rome,
go do what you got to do.
Don't forget the smoke.
Yeah.
"Humpty Dumpty
sat on a wall."
LUTHER:
Alpha team, this is Bravo.
Right on schedule.
We should have breach in 60.
Roger that.
Charlie team, report.
DECLAN: Well, I don't have
anything to report, really.
Except I think I should be
right on time.
We'll be waiting for you.
ETA two minutes.
ETHAN: Roger that.
Charlie team,
did you fire the tracer yet?
Stand by.
Firing the tracer. Now.
LUTHER: Alpha, I'm in.
T minus two minutes.
Roger that.
Charlie team, I see you.
I'm looping
the security feed.
Stand by to move.
Roger that.
Video is looped. Go.
Alpha team, catacomb video
taken care of?
Taken care of.
We're good to go.
Delta team, do you copy?
ZHEN: All I do is copy.
That's funny.
Get ready
to move into position.
I'm already there.
Really?
DECLAN: ETA 30 seconds.
See you in 30.
Alpha team
moving into position.
Bravo standing by
for transmission.
Transmitting.
Got you.
She made it.
We have
a photo opportunity.
ZHEN: Just give me the word.
I'm standing by.
Delta, ready for upload.
LUTHER:
Delta team, download good.
Listen, man,
I didn't mean to be
so cavalier the other day
about you getting engaged.
I know that. Thanks.
But a normal relationship
isn't viable for
people like us.
I don't agree with that.
Then I'm smarter than you.
I'm going up.
I agree with Luther.
We can't have
real relationships.
But you see, I love that.
Twenty-three months.
That's as long as it'll last
when you got
the baggage we do
and the lifestyle we got.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Look at me. I know what
I'm talking about.
And you know I know
what I'm talking about.
Wait here.
ZHEN: Davian just picked up
a briefcase.
We're going to have to move
sooner than we thought.
Can you identify
who made the drop?
Negative.
How close are you guys?
We're just printing now.
I'm not proud of it.
I'm not happy about it,
but I've lived with women
a few times,
and it doesn't ever
make it to two years.
You can't.
Thanks for the advice,
but it's different for me
than it is for you, you know?
I'm not in the field anymore.
Oh, okay.
Here's a retirement present.
In our job, there's always
going to be something
between you and a woman.
Always.
Luther, listen.
Dishonesty.
A dishonesty
that poisons everything.
I think I need
to tell you something...
Stop talking.
This isn't
about you, Ethan.
And whoever this girl is,
you're going to end up
messing up her life, too.
Don't do it.
Jules and I got
married two days ago.
Congratulations.
Thanks. Thanks.
He's walking. I'm going in.
ETHAN: Roger that.
I'm on my way.
Ma'am. I need you
to step back.
No. It's fine.
It's fine. It's fine.
I always spill red wine
on my white
custom-made shirt.
Okay. Step back.
It's fine. It's fine.
Bathroom.
Tell me you're on your way.
I'm on the move.
Move it. Come on.
His bodyguards are
checking out the bathroom.
I'm almost there.
He's going in.
Quiet. Read this.
Slowly.
Read it.
"The pleasure
of Buzby's company
"is what I most enjoy.
"He put a tack
on Miss Yancy's chair
"when she called him
a horrible boy.
DAVIAN:
"At the end of the month
he was flinging two kittens
"across the width of the room.
"I count on his schemes
to reveal the..."
What the hell is this?
Finish.
Alpha, you're about
to have a visitor.
Finish!
"...a way to
escape my gloom."
LUTHER: Got it.
ZHEN: Alpha, do you copy?
The guard's on his way.
Delta, stall him.
I need more time.
It's too late for that.
He's in the hallway.
Sir, is everything all right?
Everything is not all right.
Voice mask
is still compiling.
LUTHER: I need 30 seconds.
Sir?
Sir?
Six seconds, I'm uploading.
LUTHER: A way to escape
my gloom.
LUTHER: Okay. Go.
I'm fine. Wait outside.
See you in the sewer.
She's sorry
about your shirt.
That's no problem.
Her hotel has laundry service,
and she'll happily
take care of it.
You want to wash my shirt?
What--What are we going to do
while we're waiting
in your hotel room,
and I'm not wearing my shirt?
She'll think of something.
She would like to drive.
Follow me to the hotel.
Sir, would you like us
to watch the case?
No.
Nice job.
Thank you.
What's up?
Nothing. What's up with you?
Nothing.
Blow the car.
Oh. It's such a nice car.
And yet, do it.
MAN:
...covered some hot spots
over in central Eurasia.
I direct your attention
to the third satellite image
in the series
forwarded to us
by our friends...
RECEPTIONIST:
Mr. Musgrave to see you.
Send him in.
Ethan Hunt and his team
just grabbed Owen Davian
in Rome.
They're headed back now.
I thought you should know.
You were aware
of this operation?
Yes, I was.
Then good work.
Thank you.
You're dead, Mr. Davian.
There were witnesses.
That was you in the bathroom.
Now, you're going to
tell us everything.
Every buyer you've worked with.
Every organization.
What the hell is your name?
Names, contacts,
inventory lists.
You have a, a wife, girlfriend?
It's up to you
how this goes.
Because you know
what I'm going to do next?
I'm going to find her,
whoever she is,
I'm going to find her,
and I'm going to hurt her.
You were apprehended
carrying details
of the location of something
code named the Rabbit's Foot.
I'm going to make her bleed,
and cry,
and call out your name.
And you're not
going to be able to do shit.
You know why?
What is the Rabbit's Foot?
Because you're going to be
this close to dead.
And who is the buyer?
And then
I'm going to kill you
right in front of her.
I'm going to ask you
one more time.
What's your name?
What is the Rabbit's Foot?
Who are you?
And who is the buyer?
You don't have any idea
what the hell is going on,
do you?
I mean, you saw what I did
to your little blonde friend
at the factory, right?
Well, that was nothing.
That was, uh,
fun.
That was fun.
What is the Rabbit's Foot?
Ethan!
What is the Rabbit's Foot?
LUTHER: Ethan, stop!
What is it?
LUTHER: Don't do it!
Ethan!
What is the Rabbit's Foot?
You tell me!
Ethan, stop! Don't do it.
This isn't you, man!
This isn't you!
We can use him, Ethan!
You know that!
No, Ethan! Don't do it!
Please, stop!
What I'm selling,
,
and who I'm selling to
is the last thing
you should be
concerned about,
Ethan.
LUTHER: Ethan, we got it.
Lindsey's microdot.
It's a video file.
Ethan, I don't know
what they've told you.
I don't know what you think.
Just listen to me.
Brassel sent me to Germany
to surveil an exchange,
to ID a man
named Owen Davian.
I tagged his phone,
and I intercepted
a transmission.
I traced the call
through the IMF network,
and this is what came up.
The call to Davian
came from Brassel's office.
It's Brassel.
I think he's working
with Davian.
I think I'm being set up...
LUTHER: Ethan!
MAN 1: You all right?
MAN 2: Someone call for help!
Does anyone
have a cell phone?
Everybody, get down!
Get down! Get down, get down!
Everybody, get down!
There's a woman down.
I see her.
Get down!
Get down! Stay down!
Everybody, get down!
Get down! Stay down!
Get down!
Open up!
Open up! I need the prisoner!
WOMAN: Oh, my God!
It's really bleeding.
Don't leave me, okay?
Don't worry.
I'm right here.
Ethan, there's a G36
in the truck!
I know! I know!
Ethan! Get out of the truck!
Ethan, move!
Hello?
Rick, this is Ethan.
Is Julia home?
Hey, man. Hey, look,
I hope you're not mad
I'm here. It's just...
Rick, I'm not mad.
Is Julia home?
I tried her cell phone,
and there was no answer.
Uh, no. Sorry.
Hey, did your, uh...
Did your friend find you?
Which friend?
RICK: Uh, I--I don't know.
Just some English guy.
Rick, what did you tell him?
Look, it's all good, man.
I told him I didn't know
where you were,
and Julia might,
and he should just
try her at the hospital.
Hello?
All right,
see you tomorrow, Sally.
All right. Good night, honey.
Hi. It's Julia.
Please leave me a message...
NEWSCASTER: ...at 4:00 today,
the Chesapeake Bay Bridge
is closed in both directions.
Sixth floor.
Sally, this is Ethan.
I need to talk to Julia.
SALLY: Hey, honey.
She just went downstairs.
I'll transfer you.
Damn it!
Excuse me.
I was wondering
if you knew where
I might find this patient.
Probably not.
But I'll know who can.
What's that?
Sally.
Where's Julia?
Where's Julia?
I--I think she left.
Have you tried
the east building?
Has Julia left yet?
I haven't seen her.
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Have you seen Julia?
Hey, you okay?
Have you seen Julia?
No.
WOMAN: Watch it, buddy!
Jules?
DAVIAN: You hung me
outside of an airplane.
You can always tell
someone's character
by the way they treat
those they don't
need to treat well.
If you hurt her, I swear...
Don't threaten me.
Just don't.
The briefcase
I picked up in Rome,
the one you took from me,
contains the location
of the Rabbit's Foot.
You're going to get it
and bring it to me.
The Rabbit's Foot.
Ethan, you had a watch
last time I saw you.
You have 48 hours,
starting on my mark.
Wait, wait, wait.
Now, call me at this number
when you have it.
Just--Just wait.
Julia's life
for the Rabbit's Foot.
You have 48 hours,
or she dies.
Wait! Wait. Wait.
MAN ON RADIO:
Condition 1-116.
All units on scene.
We need you
to come with us.
Just...
Pete, what the hell is this?
Sorry about that, Mr. Hunt.
We were told to bring you in.
Okay.
Get ready to transport.
Whoa. Just...
Hey. Just not right now.
Just tell them
you came and that...
PETE: Ethan. Get in.
We don't want
to use force here,
and you know we will.
Ethan, get in.
Tell them that
you came here...
PETE: Ethan!
...and that I
left already, okay?
Freeze!
PETE: Ethan, stop!
Stop, Ethan!
AGENT: Yeah. Get his hands.
I reviewed the transcript
of your Berlin operation.
It's very interesting.
It seems that Agent Farris
had some information
she wished to share with you
but not with this agency.
Something you
failed to report.
You ordered
the Vatican operation
without proper approvals.
That mission resulted
in a catastrophic attack.
And then you fled the scene.
Now, I am not
a stranger to disrespect.
You don't get to where I am
without developing
a thick skin.
But what I won't stand for,
what I will lose sleep over,
and I love my sleep,
is the idea of an
irresponsible rogue agent
working in my office.
So I'm going to slow things
way down here.
You can look at me
with those judgmental,
incriminating eyes
all you want,
but I bullshit you not.
I will bleed on the flag
to make sure
the stripes stay red.
I don't know
what to say to you.
Brassel's right.
You're out of control.
Look at me.
Ethan, at least show me
the courtesy of looking at me
when I'm talking to you.
It's just, uh...
This is
so disappointing.
I wish there was, uh,
something I could do
to help you, but...
Take him to the holding cell.
No, I'm on it.
Yes, sir.
There's no need to panic.
I'll get him back.
Sir? Ethan Hunt...
I know what happened.
Give me the radio.
This is Director Brassel.
Ethan Hunt is attempting
to escape the building.
He's in the west
cargo elevator.
He must be stopped.
I want Mendoza and Graham
in the situation room
right away.
I'm having the building
surrounded, sir.
I've got units posted
at all the entrances.
ETHAN:
This is Brassel again.
I'm ordering
a code-six lockdown.
I repeat.
It's Hunt.
I know it's Hunt.
Hunt was flagged
on sub-basement nine.
I want all security personnel
down there now.
Security channel's jammed.
Hunt must be holding down
the transmit button.
We are family
I got all my sisters
with me
You've got to be kidding me.
We are family
Get up everybody
and sing
WOMAN ON PA:
Last call for flight 1162
for Helsinki,
now boarding at gate 46.
Final call for Mr. Bower.
Final call for Mr. Bower.
Please come to gate 4.
WOMAN: Mr. Pavel Sobo...
Sobotka.
ETHAN: Sobotka.
Sobotka. Okay.
And you're flying
to Shanghai?
I don't speak Czech.
I'm sorry.
Let's see
about your flight.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Don't kill me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Musgrave told us
about Julia.
We're here to help.
DECLAN: To get your wife,
you'll need the Rabbit's Foot.
According to the plans
from Davian's briefcase,
it's in a laboratory
on the 56th floor of the
Hengshan Lu Building.
Which is a nightmare
for just about
every reason.
LUTHER: They're
a Chinese military contractor.
We have no pull, no details.
The good news is,
whatever it is,
the Rabbit Foot's small,
so we can steal it.
The bad news,
we got to steal it.
From a thief's point of view,
this is worst-case scenario.
The security guards
are all privately-contracted
former
People's Liberation Army.
The only access to the lab
is by private elevator.
And that can
only be activated
by persons inside the lab.
All of it surveilled
by security cameras
within the building.
What about the roof?
Four guards full time.
Two on each rooftop.
LUTHER:
Langley was a cakewalk
compared to this.
That's the one.
How tall is that building?
DECLAN: Why?
It's 162 meters
at the highest point.
What about that,
the building on the left?
How tall is that one?
Says 226 meters.
between the buildings?
Ethan?
That's good.
I think it's tall enough.
For what?
A fulcrum.
Oh, y-y-you're gonna swing...
N-No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.
You could bounce
right off the roof.
Yes, I could.
Even if you made it
to the rooftop,
took out the guards,
and got the Rabbit's Foot,
you can't just walk out
of the lobby.
What's your exit?
Base-jump off the top.
I need a chute.
Even at 162, you're pushing
minimum height for a jump.
Chute opens
any lower than that
and you're dead.
DECLAN:
What are you going to do?
Land in the middle of Shanghai
and hope no one notices?
Central Park's
two blocks away.
Wait, wait, Ethan,
I'm not saying
I have a better idea,
but there's a point
where bold becomes stupid.
Now, we don't even know
what this thing is,
and you're talking
about handing it over
to a guy who provides
terrorists with information.
Luther, of course
I'm not suggesting that
we just hand it over.
We're going to tag
the Rabbit's Foot
so we can trace it
and know where it is.
Now, you know we can
get that gear here.
I just deliver it myself.
We contact Musgrave,
have the IMF trace a tag,
order a raid,
get the Rabbit's Foot back,
grab Davian.
Now, if I get out with Julia,
we win.
If I don't, then, uh...
Look, then she's dead anyway.
And so am I.
You know?
Goddamn it, it's 8:11,
it's 8:12.
And we have two hours
before they kill my wife.
Are you in or not?
Of course we're in.
LUTHER: You got 18 minutes.
You're going to
make it over there.
You're going to
find the Rabbit's Foot,
get back to the roof,
radio me when you're ready
to make the jump,
and we're going to
come get you.
Thank you for coming.
That's my job.
Batter up.
Oh, yeah.
They're freaking out.
Hit them again.
Okay.
LUTHER ON RADIO: He made it.
He made it.
I knew he'd make it.
I'm going in.
I'll be out in five minutes.
It's been 12 minutes.
He's got five minutes left.
If he doesn't call
Davian in five minutes, Julia's dead.
LUTHER: Anything?
Negative.
DECLAN: How about you?
Any good news?
No, nothing.
Come on, Ethan.
What is that?
When I was little I had a cat,
and he used to run away
all the time.
And it's just a prayer
I'd say to bring him home.
Teach it to me.
ETHAN: I've got the
Rabbit's Foot, but
I can't make it to the roof.
What the hell do you mean
you can't make it to the roof?
Where are you?
Look up! Look up, look up!
Oh, shit.
He's way too low.
Ethan! Get in!
They're coming!
Who?
Building security,
and they're pissed.
Okay. Go, go, go, go.
How much time you got left?
Less than two minutes.
You gotta get us out of here.
I lost the signal.
You okay?
Not yet.
Come on. Come on.
I don't have a signal.
I don't have a signal.
I'm on it. I'm on it.
I'm on it!
Zhen!
Damn it. I'm sorry.
Put pressure on it.
Tell me when
you get a signal.
What are you doing?
I got a signal!
Hit redial.
DAVIAN: You only had
five seconds left.
Do you realize that?
The Rabbit's Foot. I have it.
The train yard
at Dunan Zhong Lu.
Wait for me there. Alone.
Yeah?
ETHAN: Go secure.
We are.
I have the Rabbit's Foot.
You okay?
I'm tagging it now.
You need to run a trace.
Make sure we have eyes
on this thing.
What's the tag?
Got it.
I see you on
Luang Tao Lu Road.
If you don't hear
from me in eight hours,
you send an army
after this thing.
Good luck.
You, too.
BRASSEL: Mr. Musgrave.
MUSGRAVE: Yeah.
BRASSEL:
It's come to my attention
that yesterday afternoon
you sent a team
to the Far East.
We received intel
that Hadaam Saleen Bahar
was en route to Shanghai.
Hadaam Saleen Bahar.
That's right.
You know what I'd love?
I'd love to see that intel.
I'll be in my office.
Yes, sir.
ETHAN: Thanks again.
I'll see you back home.
Ethan.
You know they probably
plan to kill you both.
Then I won't
see you back home.
Better get back.
Drink it. No questions.
Good morning.
Jules.
We've put an explosive charge
in your head.
Does that sound familiar?
The Rabbit's Foot.
Where is it?
I gave it to you.
Now, I'm going to count to 10
and you're going to tell me
where the Rabbit's Foot is
or she dies.
Seems we have a lot
to talk about. Don't we?
Do you think I'm playing?
Son of a bitch!
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?
Where is it?
Look at me.
Where the hell is it?
Look at me. Stay with me.
Seven!
I am going to kill you. I swear to God
I'm going to...
Eight!
No, please.
Please. Don't do this.
Just let her go.
I promise you.
I promise you.
I can figure out
how to get whatever...
Nine.
Listen to me.
I want to help you get
whatever you want.
But you got to do
what's right.
What you know is right.
No, please...
No.
No.
Ten.
Don't!
BROWNWAY: I pushed him
as far as he can go.
I know he's not lying.
MUSGRAVE: I understand.
I've got some questions
I want to ask him first.
It's complicated.
You can't just
open the canister.
We had to make sure
you brought the real thing.
The Rabbit's Foot.
Now we know.
Don't you touch her!
Don't you touch her!
Davian's translator,
his Head of Security.
Remember?
At the Vatican
she failed him.
Ethan, Julia is still alive.
Davian wanted
to kill you both,
but I convinced him otherwise.
Julia hasn't seen me.
She doesn't know anything.
She's clean.
She can go on to have a life.
As long as you tell me,
what was in Lindsey's message?
I know she sent you
a microdot from Berlin.
Did Lindsey know
about me and Davian?
Is that why she
sent the message to you?
Did you read it?
Did anyone else see it?
Did she know about
the work I was doing?
Could I be
compromised at IMF?
Ethan. Ethan.
Did she buy
that Brassel set her up?
Did she buy that?
You told him.
That's how Davian knew
Lindsey was coming.
You told him.
I thought you could
get her back.
But I wasn't gonna
let Brassel, of all people,
undo the work I'd done.
I took action, Ethan,
on behalf of the working
families of our country.
The Armed Forces,
the White House.
I'd had enough of Brassel
and his sanctimony.
IMF Executive Director.
He's an affirmative action poster boy.
You grab Davian like he wanted, then what?
Davian's a weed.
You cut him out,
two more spring up
just like him the next day.
Arrest him? Then what?
You use him.
Collaborate with him.
And it's Christmas.
In 18 hours,
the Rabbit's Foot
will be delivered
to its Middle Eastern buyer,
and we'll have credible intel
to prove it.
US Security Council
will get a report
by this time tomorrow.
We're talking a military
strike within a week.
And when the sand settles,
our country will do
what it does best.
Clean up. Infrastructure.
Democracy wins.
What was
Lindsey's message?
You tell me, and Julia walks.
It's the only play
you have left.
Not till I hear her voice,
know she's alive.
Of course.
Put her on.
Jules?
JULIA: Ethan?
When we met,
there was a lake
near the mountain.
What was the lake called?
Wanaka.
Please, Ethan.
Jules.
Ethan, I don't understand...
Benjamin Dunne.
Benji, it's me.
Ethan.
What? No. Really?
Listen to me very carefully.
I need your help.
I need to trace the
location of the last call
made from this phone.
Look, no. Ethan. Shush.
BENJI: They're looking...
Everyone's looking for you.
Everyone I know.
They're looking...
I--I j-just looked it up.
Okay, you're on Interpol's
most wanted list.
And that, by the way,
is a spectacular list
to be on.
Whatever happened,
I'm sorry, but I'm
hanging up now right now.
Benji, I don't have time
for this.
What do you think happened?
I've been set up.
I think--
I think I like my job.
Okay? A lot.
All right? And you know
they're gonna be
taping this call.
And you know
you can erase it.
I'm giving you
the number right now.
Are you ready?
All right. Just hang on.
I'm gonna lose my citizenship
because of this, you know.
Okay. Wait. Okay.
Just ho-hold the line, please.
Are you there?
Yeah.
Okay.
Maybe we can, uh,
share a jail cell together, you know?
If this all goes tits up,
which it will.
The location of that number
is Shanghai.
There, I just told you.
Shanghai.
I've just aided and abetted an enemy of the state.
Fantastic. Thank you.
Am I close?
Use this phone
to track my location.
Oh, you're there.
Well, you're-- you're--
you're-- you're close.
How close? Is the signal
in the building?
No, no, no.
It isn't coming from there.
It's in a building
one mile to the northeast.
ETHAN:
Benji, lead me to the signal.
BENJI: There is one thing.
What the hell are you doing
in Shanghai?
I'll tell you when I see you.
BENJI: What you, uh...
You--You--You--
You need to go north.
Okay, there's a bridge.
Uh, get to it, cross it.
Make a left.
Go three-quarters
of a mile along the river.
I got it. I got it.
Good, good. That's right.
Keep going. Keep going.
Make your next left
and then the next one.
And then follow that down
A thousand yards.
Okay. Okay, okay.
Okay, okay. Left. Left.
Yeah, that's good.
That's good. Keep going.
Keep going.
Okay, now look... Hiya. Hi.
ETHAN: Benji, where?
Benji? Which way do I go?
Now take a right.
Okay. Go down, left.
Left? I'm going left.
Good, good.
It's in the second building
on your left.
The signal bearing's
plus or minus three meters
from the northeast corner.
I owe you.
Jules. Jules.
You're gonna be okay.
Oh, God!
God!
I've activated
the charge in your head.
You have maybe
four minutes left.
Didn't I tell you
she'd call out your name?
Ethan. Ethan.
No.
JULIA: Please.
And I told you I was
going to kill you
in front of her?
Well, I'm going to
kill her in front of you.
JULIA: Ethan?
Are you okay?
I don't understand
what's going on, Ethan.
I know. I know. Just wait.
What do those men
want from you?
Why are we here?
How did you find me?
Please, Ethan.
What the hell is going on?
Are you okay?
Ethan, what's wrong?
Okay. Oh, God.
I'm going to
tell you everything.
You just stay with me.
Ethan. What's happening?
What are you looking for?
We've got to get out of here.
Not yet.
They don't have one!
What?
A defibrillator.
A defibrillator?
Ethan?
Ethan? Who are these people?
What the hell
are we doing here?
Good!
This is a Beretta 92F.
It's a very accurate,
close-range weapon.
Don't point it at me.
Sorry.
It holds 15 rounds.
When the mag is empty,
the slide will lock back
like this.
How do you know
so much about this?
To reload, push this button.
The empty mag falls out
and you shove
the other one in,
like the batteries
in the flashlight
in the kitchen,
then release the slide.
Why are you giving me a gun?
There could be others.
If you have to use it,
you stay low.
You identify your enemy.
Point and shoot.
It's very simple.
Point and shoot.
Stand back.
Good.
I have a charge in my head.
I'm going to die
unless you kill me.
What?
Throw the switch on and off.
Don't forget the off.
I can't do that.
You can bring me back.
I'll come back.
I can't.
You have to! There's no time!
Now! Please!
Wait, wait!
Wait. Wait. I love you.
I love you.
Oh, God.
Come on, baby.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.
Come on, baby.
I need you to come back.
I need you back.
Oh, God.
You did that?
Wow.
JULIA: So,
I was just thinking...
I was thinking you
might want to tell me
why we're in China.
I know.
I...
I work for an agency.
It's called IMF.
What does that stand for?
Impossible Mission Force.
Shut up.
No, I'm not kidding.
You don't understand.
Everything I'm telling you
is top-secret.
JULIA: You can trust me.
ETHAN: Yeah, I know.
BRASSEL: Just wanna
show my appreciation
for your work.
Call it reparations
for anything I might
have put you through.
You should know
the White House
has contacted me.
Now, there's a job
that they are
very interested
in speaking with you about.
Thank you,
but I have a lot
to think about.
You aren't
considering quitting,
are you, Ethan?
I'm considering
going on my honeymoon.
Have fun.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Hey, uh, one thing.
The Rabbit's Foot.
What is it?
Promise me you'll stay,
I'll tell you.
I'll send you a postcard.
Fair enough.
