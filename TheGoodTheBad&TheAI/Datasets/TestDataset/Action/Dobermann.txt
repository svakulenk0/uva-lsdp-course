Eternal and Almighty God
You make the deaf hear.
You make the mute speak.
You send your son to us
to help us fight against Satan
Enabling mankind
To part from darkness, and enter the light.
Bless this child.
Deliver him from sins
and shine because of you.
May the Holy Spirit be with him
Yann
In the name of Father, Son...
and the Holy Spirit
I baptize you.
Do you see?
His eyes are like your dog's.
Father's water...it's too cold.
Don't disturb him.
Wait.
Wait.
I have something for him.
Nice, huh?
.357 Magnum.
I bought it from an arms dealer.
Aim for the stomach, then the head.
You won't miss.
I want to carve a skull on the butt.
What do you think?
Put it away, this is the wrong place.
Isn't this a little soon?
Why? How can man not have a gun?
First religious rite, then rite of passage.
The baptism of gun fire.
Jerry, don't!
Shit, do you see that?
- You like her?
- No.
Do you or don't you?
Y-y-yes I like...
Isn't she pretty?
Want to get on the truck with her?
For five minutes.
Just the two of you.
Yes or no?
She gets excited when she sees a uniform.
She's completely deaf.
Whatever you say doesn't matter.
That's disgusting!
You wet your pants!
Shit.
Man, change your clothes.
It doesn't pay to wear a uniform.
Out!
Not out.
- It's out!
- Out?
How could you tell, it's a meter away?
Pitbull scores, now serves.
That crow is so noisy
what does he know about being a referee?
Forget it, it's a foul.
I don't care.
Give him a lesson.
Somebody pretends to be an expert again,
I'll show him.
I can't take these Nazis.
Then go buy some balls.
These guys are taking a holiday.
You think this is cool?
Did you not see them play tennis?
You still think that they're cool?
They are nuts.
That little lice-headed idiot
He took out his gun
and blew the tennis ball away!
They're being watched.
He will meet up with them.
I've said it a hundred times,
this feels like a dream.
But it wasn't a dream.
I've seen it.
Who's the one holding the dog?
Don't know, got here last night.
What kind of dog is that?
Pitbull.
No, this isn't a Pitbull.
I am Jacky, also known as Pitbull.
An expert in combat and robbery.
With an axe.
With an axe?
They seem to be all there.
Seems like it.
He's Mosquito?
No, he's Pitbull.
That's Mosquito, he's very tense.
He's a priest?
I'll tell you one thing
watch out for Mosquito, he's trigger happy.
Do you ladies give handjobs?
Not everyone gets to torture these
fifteen-year-old addicts.
Strange, my hands smell like meat.
This is the famous Dobermann?
He is the famous Dobermann.
They seem like serious drug addicts.
They're all alike.
Drugs will hook you; break you.
It's the trend.
Once I start, these clowns are dead meat.
Of course.
But you won't start.
Cristini, you're out.
There are so many complaints about you.
It's like a mountain.
Go home, let us do our job.
Yes, sir.
Shouldn't he call?
That's not his style.
Do we have an answering machine?
In case he calls while we're playing.
That makes sense.
If he doesn't call, we don't have to wait.
Why are you painting?
We leave in 3 days!
What happened to this house?
You want to know?
A decent young man
Broke
So he uses a shotgun to end his problems.
His wife,
and himself.
Goddamn it!
The blood is making me sick.
It's all over my ceiling.
I can't sleep at night,
because children are crying.
Why doesn't he go for the right people?
Without faith, man goes mad.
Without faith?
Without money.
You're dead.
I know.
My sister...
Let go, it's my sister!
Are we moving again?
I guess so.
How about some coffee to wake up?
I don't drink coffee.
There should be beer in the refrigerator.
They are so beautiful
They're identical twins.
Great, just like that
I'll help you put the knife back
My lovely younger sister.
Pony, stop messing around.
You want to be castrated?
She is my sister!
My sister!
Shut up.
Help me to press the car.
Shit, why don't you get
a garbage man.
Probably because of the legend.
I don't care about no legend.
- Pony.
- What?
Don't sell it.
Come here.
You miss me?
I miss you all the time.
You want your car pressed?
Are you asking me?
Do you have any weapons?
No, there's no time.
He's sick.
That will leave marks.
Do you want to commit robbery?
This is a big deal
I need thirty men
Get Big Nose, Torpedo
and the Matthew Brothers
- All of them?
- Right.
- There's a lot of them.
- Right.
When?
Tomorrow, go now.
- Hello?
-
- Oh, it's you.
-
- Not this weekend.
-
Why? I just can't.
I didn't say that I
think you're a fool.
- I just have things to do.
-
Do you understand?
I know
I get him the next two weekends
-
- Really?
It's a deal.
- Bye.
-
That woman's a drag.
That idiot came to
the wrong place!
Calm down.
Stop taking drugs
It makes you tense.
Let me.
Do I look suspicious?
Tense?
I'm not tense, are you tense?
No.
Priest, you came out without backup?
What's that?
A halo?
Nat the Gipsy.
Hello princess.
We were expecting you.
Thank you for all these gifts.
Right, thanks.
What did you rob?
I didn't rob, I made
an investment.
It is so convenient to
cheat with sign language.
Would you teach me?
You rob and let us wait.
Thank you for the invitation.
What?
How long has he been like this?
He's been bored for weeks.
He dreams of robbing banks.
The pillage...
He thinks that policemen
have become an illusion.
I am thinking with a new perspective,
about subtle differences.
He forgets what age he's in.
He isn't cautious of technology.
He sees a security camera,
he yawns.
How about Cordell?
What about electronic cashiers?
How will you rob these?
Fax machine?
Yann, tell him to face reality.
We can't deal with him.
Not only are banks modernized
Sunny gave me a laser-guided
machine gun.
This is a small missile.
No door can stop this.
After breaking into the bank,
the shock wave will pin
everyone to the wall.
The shock wave of the rocket
Beautiful.
It's Christmas.
There is the scent of Christmas trees.
It's Cordell.
Sir, there's news from the villa.
A man and a woman showed up
They all left together
I'll fill you in later.
My God...
They're moving.
They all left the villa.
Him...he must be Dobermann!
Who's checking out who?
Casey, Dushey, Noby
They are tracking the car.
Lucky, let's keep it that way.
Tell the mobile team to stand by.
Wait, aren't you rushing it a bit?
They might be going bowling.
Don't rush it.
Taking three cars to
the bowling alley?
They must be robbing a bank.
We should move out.
You got your license
in kindergarten.
What?
Come here.
If I go down, take care of Nata.
She wouldn't pay attention to me.
Don't let her be foolish.
What?
Ooh, a blonde...
What?
I mean you look good in a wig.
If you laugh, I'll kill you.
I'm putting it away and changing
Going home to my parents this afternoon
It's only a birthday, don't worry.
I'm not worried.
Call me, I'll come meet you.
What do your parents think you do?
Studying law.
You should see me in my black gown.
Goddamn faggot.
I want to go with you.
We're robbing a bank
Goddamn duty officer
Why do you put on this
kind of make-up?
Those girls who get arrested
always look sloppy in the papers.
So what?
She does it on purpose
to set an example.
For example, they may say that you're gay.
Be careful!
Are you nuts? Shit!
Are you coming, baby?
This is such a mess!
Let's go.
Your woman is really deaf?
Mosquito, aren't you
wearing a mask?
I like to see my face
in the newspaper.
Who else is on this one?
Leo, Pony, Big Nose, Torpedo
and the Matthew Brothers
They're all here?
You got a bunch of clowns.
Nobody's laughing.
See you tonight!
Don't forget,
today is my birthday!
East station.
I don't know what it is.
What is this shit?
Fox 3 calling Z1, over.
This is Z1, come in Fox 3.
A Mercedes with 5 passengers
leaving exit No. 3
heading toward the Louvre.
Fox 4 calling Z1, over.
Fox 4, come in.
Funny, the traced car
just came out.
Driver is female.
Keep tracing!
Sebastian Street, armed robbery
Republic Plaza, armed robbery
National Square subway entrance
Montpanas,
Beret Street Business Center
Your plan worked.
There are never enough cops
to go around.
What next?
Claude, this is a trap.
Mind your own business.
They went straight to Defont Street.
We have to go now.
Don't think that Cristini is right?
All the police are dealing with
robberies. They are phantoms.
There are no cops left to deploy.
Not one!
There's bound to be one real
phantom
I do not want to miss,
understand?
Are you coming?
I set the time and place
for this kind of massacre.
Let's go.
It's a beautiful little prank.
They must be dreaming if they
think that they can catch them all.
Fox 4, calling Z1
Fox 4 calling Z1
Fox 4 calling Z1
Fox 4, come in.
The woman in the Lamborghini
has just stopped the vehicle
at the Olympic Hotel
Awaiting instruction.
Fox 4, awaiting instruction.
Isn't this a good opportunity
to show off?
You deal with the driver of the Lamborghini.
I'll tell the commissioner the good news.
The end of Dobermann.
Fox 4 can move out...
Claude's men are useless.
We are back at war.
Unless they can kill Dobermann.
What kind of chance do they have?
Must you drive so fast?
You don't know
where you're going!
Fuck! She loves explosions!
This is Fox 1.
Come in, over.
Sebastian Street bank
has been robbed.
Fox 1, get ready.
Hurry!
My eardrum is about to break.
Miss...
Marx, did you see that?
Bank, bang!
You call him Marx?
I loved his movies
when I was a kid.
Bought all the tapes.
They're hard to find nowadays.
Z1, report your current position.
Don't stop, keep moving!
Don't be rash,
there are too many men.
We've sealed off all escape routes.
They can't get away.
Can't get away?
This is full of holes, a trap.
They're leaving.
David, keep up!
What are you doing? Faster!
Wait! They're slowing down.
They aren't robbing another bank?
They're stopping at...the front
of the Union Bank
Don't move!
What are they doing?
Sir...
Sir...I'm too old.
I can't get down.
It's alright, you can stand up.
- What?
- You can stand!
What, I'm busy!
I'm busy!
I just came to get 500 francs.
<You forget the rent!
You forget your child!>
No I did not.
<I don't want to bounce checks!
You owe me 30,000 Francs!>
-Huh?
-
Who do you think you are?
The queen of France?
Take it, we aren't theives!
Go to hell!
At last.
Good, let's go.
Calm down, calm down.
Just wait.
This is a trick.
Trick? What trick?
Two people are staying inside the bank.
They'll come out to drive a different vehicle.
No, they won't come out.
Damn it!
They tricked us!
Z1 calling all Foxes.
Clear all the exits.
Don't act without my command.
Repeat: follow my orders.
I don't need a hostage situation.
If the people in the car signal,
the robbers inside will come out.
Then we move in, got it?
It's going to get fucked up.
No, there are only two of them.
There are six of us,
and we're in the dark.
Let's go.
Shit!
It's me.
This is your first time.
Do not take the gate.
Asshole!
Don't move!
Don't worry, it's no problem.
Take that, cop.
Don't...
Well?
His head ruined my gun!
I don't like masks.
- Hello.
-
We're still inside bank.
We'll be right there.
We have to go back. Cops.
Leo, the one on the motorcycle.
The one on the motorcycle!
Shit!
Shoot, quickly!
Shoot!
Where is he?
The invisible rider
The messenger from hell
Shoot him!
Hurry!
Goddamn cops!
Helmet!
Faster, priest.
Grenade.
No!
His light will shine on you
He's holding on!
He will make you stronger
You call out to God,
he shall accept you.
You shout.
He'll say...
I'm coming.
What is this? Blood?
It's the rider's. It's stuck.
Doesn't matter.
It's not the rider's,
there's hair.
It's Marx's.
What are you doing?
Give me his gun, I want
this to look like suicide.
Good idea.
What does this bitch want now?
- Hello?
-
Sorry, I thought it was
my wife again.
It's Yann. He's coming back for us.
Great, there's still a ton
of cops out there.
- I'll take care of them.
- Wait!
Use that guy as a shield.
Come on, let's go.
Hey! You idiots.
Put down your weapons.
Very good...
Slowly
Great
Come on, cops...
Give me the gun!
Thank you, sir.
I am collecting guns.
Taxi's here!
Let's go.
Roy
I said this wouldn't work.
We have won.
They have lost.
Not bad.
Marx?
Where's Marx?
Sorry.
I opened the door, he ran out.
What? Then let's look for him.
Cops will be here any minute.
I don't care, I want my dog!
Wait! Pitbull!
Let me go, or I'll kill you!
Here is Marx.
A cop on a motorcycle was shooting at us.
God has punished him
He is beheaded and gone to heaven.
What?
He means we blew his head off.
I'll give him the best grave
The best grave for any dog.
Then I will skin these cops alive!
Sure.
Of course.
Fuck!
There's twice the bread
and cheap drinks
Want hot sauce?
No hot sauce, mustard.
The woman left the hotel.
She's dressed like a man.
A lesbian in men's clothes?
Yes, sir.
It's someone we know.
You remember Olivier?
The prostitute named Sunny?
That's him.
Look what I've found in the car.
That bitch and Dobermann are together.
Fine, where is she now?
Her parents' house,
around the corner.
Good, let's go find her.
Aren't you eating?
Act casual.
They're Fox 4.
Tell them to get lost.
Go, let's go.
Has the commissioner assigned you?
Really?
Son of a bitch!
Go away!
Leave me alone!
Goddamn it.
Shut up! Get lost!
Do you understand?
She's bleeding
Police!
Call the police!
This is exciting!
I love it.
It's delicious, Mom.
But too much.
You're too thin,
eat a little more.
You didn't mention anything
about school.
There is nothing to say.
When can you start working?
It's not easy being a lawyer.
You have a wife and family
We can't always take care of you.
Now, we can.
Leave him alone.
Let him study.
You eat, I'll get the door.
Are you expecting anyone?
Who are you?
Police.
The Police.
Sit.
Hello, Sunny.
Can I call you Sunny
In front of your family?
I'll call you Olivier.
Do you know them?
You want to talk, we can
go somewhere else.
Why?
Isn't it better in front of
the family?
Why does he call you Sunny?
Why don't you speak?
What are you doing with Dobermann?
Robbing banks for fun?
We cannot so despise money.
We must respect money...
But Dobermann
Dobermann deserves to die,
and be buried six feet under.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
I am talking about Dobermann!
Calm down.
This is a waste of time, right?
You're doing all right, Sunny
Must be, driving a fast car.
Is that car yours?
You must give thousands
of blowjobs,
To be able to buy this car.
Something normal people
are incapable of.
We found this in the car.
This is what we are
more familiar with.
You don't mind your son getting
his prick removed?
Your son giving blowjobs all day.
Don't you mind?
What? Asshole!
Your mother is not polite.
Tell them they are wrong.
Tell them!
Right.
Say we have the wrong place.
Say it, say it!
They're here for me.
I'm not a law student,
I'm a prostitute.
Shut up!
I won't.
You want me to become a lawyer,
I've made it halfway.
Mother, you don't have to
feed me medicine anymore.
I'm always farting because
of anal sex.
Good job, Sunny.
You would rather ruin your family...
The show must go on.
You even have a child.
You have both sexes.
To fuck and be fucked.
Where's Dobermann?
This child will say
that papa is a faggot.
I love kids
I mean it
I want to have my own
We'll get along fine
We can play for hours.
But there is no time now.
Julie!
Don't move!
Put the child back.
See what you are forcing me to do?
Just to protect one asshole.
Where is he?
I'll kill the child
if you don't tell me!
I'll beat your wife!
What were you thinking?
Are you still dreaming?
Such a pity,
especially on his birthday.
Really?
Today is his birthday?
That makes a difference
I hate to ruin birthdays.
Even if the birthday boy
is a queer.
Everybody should get a present.
Here you go, baby.
Don't.
Don't!
Don't...
You should have seen how
I blew his head off!
That cop is gone.
From the telescope
It looks like a movie.
Pity, no slow motion replay.
But cops all have hard heads.
We tried to kill him, but failed.
Can you pray for my dog?
Kill him!
All the teeth?
O.K.
I'm leaving.
So soon?
Goodbye, everyone.
Mosquito.
Mosquito!
- You want me to stay here with you?
- No.
You have a date with Sunny?
I want to get my money first.
Call Sunny before you go.
Why?
Don't you think that
the cops are moving fast?
There are cops everywhere.
Isn't that part of your plan?
Are you happy about
killing two cops?
I can't just sit there,
waiting to die.
I'll call him.
God,
Ride father's horse.
- Hello?
-
It's you.
<No, it's the Pope.
How is my car?>
Just fine.
The elevator's broken.
I'm out of breath.
No, no problem.
They're washing dishes.
Why do you say that?
-
- See you tonight.
So?
They're going to Joey's tonight.
Beside the canal.
The club with a skull.
You're going too
Looking lovely, wearing a smile.
I can't...
Yes, you can.
My man is a good cop.
But he has no patience with children.
Don't worry,
it'll be great tonight.
You'll be breathtaking.
The queen of the club.
Champagne!
The delivery man
will be here after noon.
- What?
- The delivery man will be here after noon!
What?
Just one problem.
Speak!
We have to kill the duty officer.
Is that a problem?
You think this is a problem?
No, I can help you kill
the duty officer.
There are two of them.
Then I will kill two people.
I love this, Victoria!
Robbing banks is great
Killing cops is great
- Blow me!
- No problem.
Nature is so corrupt.
What did he say?
What did you say?
Nature is so corrupt
and loves no one.
- What is corrupt?
- Nature.
It's only lions eating zebras.
Zebra?
You don't know what a zebra is.
I know it when I see it
Here, there is a big zebra.
The biggest in the world,
still eaten.
What is this shit?
Why don't you get a real woman?
What's the difference?
Sunny said she fucked all of you.
What is he saying?
I'll hit him in his stupid mouth!
Calm down.
You've got a woman,
stop complaining.
I've never fucked a man.
Hey, a mouth is a mouth!
Fuck! How much longer do we
have to wait?
He's not coming.
He'll come.
I don't believe it, he's nuts.
He's not crazy.
Before I reached the age of one
He gave me my first gun.
So what?
That's Uncle Joey.
Let's go.
- What?
- There are cops everywhere.
Stop being paranoid.
You always think there are cops
everywhere.
Not tonight.
I feel something horrible.
Let's get out of here.
What are you waiting for?
Don't touch me like this.
You're blind.
I'm not blind, I'm only deaf.
I know...
Shoot the girl first.
What?
Headquarters calling Luna 1.
This is Luna 1, over.
Commissioner says it's urgent
that he speaks with you.
You cut the radio?
After I get rid of Dobermann,
the Commissioner will thank me
Asshole.
Kiss my ass.
What is this?
If there are cops,
the alarm will show.
Put that gun away.
Why hide the gun if it's a cop?
Come on...
How are you, Mosquito?
Next week, my darlings,
I'll be going to...
New York
When you see me again
I'll have a little pussy
and a huge clitoris!
He's here!
I can't believe we've found him.
Don't shout, it will make the child tense.
Tell the Commissioner to
send all units.
Why not ask for the air force?
I don't know
what you're thinking
But I know what
these devils are plotting.
I am still going to
call the Commissioner.
Shut up!
You pest.
You could have captured Dobermann.
Two men are dead
because you're afraid.
Shut up or go back, O.K.?
They are like fine game
Tastes better when it's a little rotten.
One more
and another.
Smoke some pot.
Shoot up.
Let them play
Let them get stoned.
We'll wait by the door
and catch them one by one.
Like ripe fruit falling from the trees.
You hid your drugs in your bullets?
Cops would never look in there.
Good idea.
Take that.
This may kill you.
You didn't remove the detonator!
Why remove it?
Yeah, why remove it?
What do you think about me?
With you, I feel like a woman.
You're handsome.
Don't look at me like that.
What? What's the matter with you?
Don't you feel well?
Come...
It stinks.
Who farted in here?
The kid just took a dump.
Go change him, it stinks!
What?
Someone was showing a gun
in front of me
I came to dance, not to see guns.
- It's Pony.
- That's right.
Others would complain too
Get back on stage, I'll handle it.
I'll be right back.
Right?
Happy Birthday, Sunny.
This is fun.
Yann!
Thanks.
What's wrong with you?
I have to take a shit.
Someone's in the toilet.
I can't wait!
When I can't hold it, I have to go!
Then go outside and take a shit.
- Outside? Fuck you and outside!
- Yeah, now's the time.
I'll show you my shit.
A group of lunatics.
What can you do with
these morons?
They are the best.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna shit in the canal.
He's not going to piss over us.
Who is he?
Don't know.
He's desperate.
He's not pissing.
What is he doing?
All right...
Shit, the kid!
Stop! Police!
Damn...
I thought you tied her up!
Damn!
Baby, it's alright.
Degenerate!
Shit!
No.
You go down. You, go up.
Take him back to the car.
Yann, hurry!
They shot my dick!
Police! Get down!
I can't see!
Shit, the drugs!
Damn it!
Go ahead! We'll show them!
I'll call the Commissioner.
Welcome to reality, baby.
That way. Careful!
Almost there.
- Where's Dobermann?
- Didn't find him.
Why did the music stop?
Why did the music stop?
Get up, moron!
This way, we'll be safe.
That's the old escape route.
It leads to the parking lot.
When it's quiet, we can leave.
There's enough beer to
last two weeks.
I have to go look for my bird.
What is that?
A security device?
No...
If it's a video camera,
they'll be right on our tails.
Invisible, the wall is full
of security devices.
Completely soundproof, very private.
You know any good place?
Piece of shit!
Don't break it, I don't have any more.
- Can you pray?
- I don't know.
- Pray.
- Shit, what are you doing?
Don't shoot, I have hostage!
Please don't shoot!
- We're coming out!
- He's crazy!
Put down your weapon, or he dies!
They're together!
May the Lord be with us.
Almighty Lord...
Stop praying. Get in the car.
Get in, hurry!
Sir, Officer Bowman.
What about Bowman?
His head has been blown off!
Good!
Sunny, you're beautiful.
Kiss me.
Can I retreive the transmitter now?
Get this snitch out of here.
No, it's not like that...
I will put a swastika
on your grave.
We'll discuss decoration later.
Take them up first
Make them talk.
Strange, everyone got busted.
How did you get away?
You know the rules.
Tell Yann, it was for the baby.
Let's go.
No...
Wait, wait!
You have to.
No, I can't die.
Forget about my little brother.
Pay no attention to what I'm saying.
Can't get arrested for a poke.
You're pissing blood.
Stop talking about piss.
Don't make me scold you, it hurts.
It's O.K.
Remember our first robbery?
The post office on Duke Street?
We ran out, and then...
A police car came,
I was going to surrender.
You'd already drawn your gun.
What did I do?
You shot those bastards.
That's right.
Those sons of bitches.
You told me...
What did I tell you?
What did I say?
You said: "Don't let the bastards get you."
You're better,
and you have better weapons.
You're not going to hand me over?
Pony...
He's not going to make it.
Look, it's Nata and Pitbull.
Jacky Sueur
a.k.a.
Pitbull
Yann Le Pentrec
a.k.a.
Dobermann
They are all villains.
Jean-Claude Ayache, Mosquito!
Elie Frossard, the Priest!
Have you heard of them?
Tell me which team
I may remember.
What kind of sport do they play?
Here's a picture
of you and Dobermann.
You want my autograph?
Isn't this your mark?
You all have it.
I like dogs.
The drug charge alone
will get you 15 years.
More than that.
Much more.
The dead officer, head of family.
I came for a friend's
birthday party!
Her name is Sunny, ask her.
Her? Do you also not know her?
On her shoulder, she's got
the same tattoo as you.
You don't know her?
You must know Dobermann.
He is your boyfriend.
Poor fool
He got away,
you got prison for life.
You're still young.
It's a long road.
A very long life ahead of you.
With no one to depend on,
you think he'll wait 20 years?
What's that mean?
I get it.
You get what?
Go to hell!
Bitch!
You have nobody to lean on.
Your Nazi brothers all ran away.
Only the two of you left.
Bastard!
Sorry, David.
Include the cleaning bill
on your expenses.
This man is sick,
he should be put away.
There.
Shit, Pony...
No.
Wait. Wait!
Young, there are cops outside.
You take care of Pony,
at least until tomorrow.
Don't let them get him.
- I told you to stop!
- Get lost.
Stop it, you're insane!
Get lost!
Go!
Shit!
Cristini.
Cristini!
What kind of joke are you playing?
Shit! Watch out.
Cristini!
I'm going to fuck his woman
Watch.
You lose!
You lose, do you hear me?
You want to mess with me?
Fuck you!
Let's see
Who's the boss.
I'll fucking kill you!
Son of a bitch, I got you now.
Come on!
Fuck you!
Fuck you, you hear?
Tonight we chop off cops'
heads for free!
For Leo!
For Bulldog!
For Pony.
Alive.
I'm alive.
God...
Our lives are short and fragile.
Death reminds us of this.
But you are everlasting.
Your love is greater than Death.
We hand our brothers...
and our sisters to You.
Forgive her sins
So that You may protect her
In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ.
Amen.
This kind of burial is suspicious.
You want the real thing?
