And you conduct this marriage
Did you tell about this marriage
Why?
For kick!
Do you've to come this far to marry?
Can't we tie the knot before

If anyone asks in future
about your marriage,
Oh no don't ask about it,
it had running, chasing,
jumping, firing,
when you tell it had everything,
it'll be kick to you and the listener.
Don't tell your children stories
about crows and foxes.
Tell them your marriage story,
it'll give them kick.
Hey! Had we been caught
we would've lost lives.
Useless life! What if it's lost!
Can we get kick if we fear for that?
I can't take it anymore.
Brother, it's not important
why you did all this,
I was sad for eloping to marry
without my mother,
but now with your grace,
I don't have that worry too.
It's giving me terrible kick!
May God bless you with life long kick!
Even rogue elephant will
calm down on seeing me.
You made me run on streets
like a dog.
I'll not spare you,
I'll make you fall at my feet.
Don't taunt and make
a saint into roaring lion,
don't make me show my other face,
even if you think, it can't happen,
because I've only one face!
Did you expect punch dialogue, sister?
That's not my character. Bye sister.
Who is he?
Will he play with other's lives
for his kick?
Is he human?
You got this doubt if he's human now,
No, one new it's his first kick
This is his thrill
It was in his mother's stomache
It was a normal delivery
at the hospital
He was not normal
but born up side down
He was making the doctor smile
When kid's had bottle in there mouth
he was
He use to dive from the top into
his swimming pool
He use to do thing's upside down
He use to use both his hand
to play
He defeated everyone
He use to use laptop
and type upside down
He will do anything for kick?
Strange

said he Ieft the job.
I asked him why.
He said that he has
Iost kick in thatjob.
He keeps taking up jobs
and resigning next day.
Neither I understand him
nor his kick.
I thought he wiII change
if he marries.
PeopIe who know this idiot wiII
not give their daughter to him.
Even our reIatives have
stopped visiting us,
fearing that we might
seek an aIIiance.
I want to see him settIe in Iife.

Partner? Who is your partner?
You heIped me in robbing, right?
ActuaIIy I knew that Minister's
money is with the peon.
After I made you my partner in
the pIan and you caught him,
I came to know
where's the money,
it means I made you aIso
my partner in the crime, right?
Want me to send your share
of the booty, partner?
I Iike you...
You're making a grave mistake
by making me your partner.
You became my partner the day
you shot a buIIet into me.
If I had been your partner I wouId've
shot the buIIet into your heart.
You should be at the olympic's
Lottery
You Iike chaIIenges.
You can guess it from my
modus operandi, say something new.
Your body can bear anything.
You can say it Iooking at my body,
say something new.
You trust your sense of timing,
you're cocksure nobody
can catch you,
above aII you're good in
making caustic remarks.
You can judge it from my words,
say something new, partner.
If my guess is right, you're near by,
Iooking at me whiIe speaking to me.
Your guess is perfectIy right.
One more thing,
you're the best one to catch me,
but do remember one thing,
I'm aIways top and you're aIways down.
You can never catch me.
You've hurt my ego unnecessariIy,
and chaIIenged me,
wherever you may hide,
I'II hunt you down.
How can you catch me, partner?
Do you know how do I Iook Iike?
You don't know.
Do you know where wouId I be?
You don't know.
Do you know who's next victim?
You don't know.
Do you know where
wouId I be tomorrow?
You don't want to meet the
character in your story,
but I want to meet the
character in my story,
He is nearby
This time he can't escape
I will get him

Lottery

India's health care is
in his hands..
I've killed thousands..
Because I don't have enough
medicines in my possession..
neither the latest technology..
Absolutely true..
You're amazing..
Who is this?
With both hands,
I greet you..
I'll lift you and
place you on my shoulders..
and I'll kiss both your cheeks..
I'll pull you closer and dance with you
What Uncle..
we were having fun
Devi I need to talk to you..
Who are you looking for?
Nobody..
Why did the world health standard
reject your medicines and machines?
We are here..
We will sort everything..
Yes speak Shekar..
-Sir, the bracelet belongs to a girl named Shaina.
What?
Yes speak Shekar..
-Sir, the bracelet belongs to a girl named Shaina.
What?
-Yes sir, the high commissioners daughter
Shaina gave Devil the bracelet
as a gift..
What is the connection between
Shaina and Devil?
My lifes biggest tragedy..
Congratulations partner..
I told you Devil will
definitely come..
To protect her ex - boyfriend..
I don't know about Devil..
but Devi won't shoot Shaina..
If you don't know, then look into
my eyes and tell me who is inside..
Devi or Devil..
I've had enough..
I know that my son is the Devil..
My name is Anil Singh..
and this is my wife Nandini..
We live life happily on
a salary of 3 thousand
and we share this happiness
with our daughter Jhumki..
Our little family
and our little dreams..
Everything was perfect..
One day Jhumki fell unconscious..
We rushed her to hospital..
The doctor said that
Jhumki had a tumor..
She didn't have much time and we needed
to get money urgent for the treatment..
We sold Nandini's jewelry
to get the money..
Jhumki was our life..
and if we lost our life,
how were we to live?
our strength was finished..
Maybe in our death,
we would find new a life..
She is in St Marys Home..
Please save her..
Father, how much money
do we have in the bank?
What if Jhumki dies?
There is one thing
we can do..
We have a trust..
Angel health care..
Hey make it fast..
Yes Sir..
-Humans are not mannequins..
How long must I hold
this titanic pose.. Quickly..
Sir, I studied one case..
Who's child is it?
Your relative..
-No sir, not my relative..
Sir you have many charitable trusts..
Remember I told you that you
would come begging at my feet one day..
Today who won?
Me or him..
At least give a smile..
Look how happy they are..
But think about it.. the whole city..
the whole state.. the whole country
How  many kids suffer ?
I will get all the childrens lists
Everywhere I'm asked..
What gives me this kick?
Think, From where did I get that kick?
from a small childs smile..
If 1 smile gives me such a kick..
How many kicks would I get
from a thousand smiles?
Where are we going to get so much money?
from the same place this came..
But he was going to shoot me..
-No my child...
He will never do that..
I get my kicks from victory..
but losing kicks are not that bad..
Don't be afraid..
they don't know who you are..
its the answer to my childrens future..
You will die..
Then on the 14 November
I will die..
but on the 15 of November,
I'll join you..
and you won't be able
to do a thing about it.
Come on .. make it fast
quickly quickly..
Are you mad?
can't you see?
Don't fool around..
not today..
I know..
He will come..
He will definitely come..
now watch the fun..
I always win..
Who are you?
hey kill him..
As you sow..
so shall you reap..
All the treatments will be free..
absolutely free..
All the money that comes..
will be spent on the children only..
My king..
-Speak my king..
You take the van and go..
while I take the police on a joyride..
Whats happening here?
Today is 14 November
Childrens day..
Everything is over..
you used force.. you travelled abroad.. but
He is going to handle the Devil case..
I know him..
-Hmm
I'm sure I know you..
-I doubt it partner
Because I don't forget
a case or a face..
What is this new drama?
Its not a drama..
Its a kick..
Didn't I tell you..
on the 15th I'll join you,
and you won't be able to do a thing about it.
What are your'll going on about?
Devi has come..
I'm sure Devil won't be far behind..
Partner, I was never against you..
It was all about the children..
Women and work..
You took both away..
and you telling me
you not against me..
Its not the first time..
You will never understand
