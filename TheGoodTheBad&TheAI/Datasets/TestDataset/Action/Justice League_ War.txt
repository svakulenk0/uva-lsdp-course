New insight on the rash
of terrifying abductions
Plaguing Gotham City.
Warning, this footage may be too
mature for younger audiences.
Is this the mysterious batman
Who's been spotted in Gotham?
Uh, stop it, max.
Too scary.
I'm the batman, Charlie.
I've come to suck your blood.
Hey, come on!
Stop the bus, damn it!
Aah!
Going somewhere, buddy?
All right. You wanna dance?
Let's dance.
Your move, precious.
No! No, don't!
Crap.
Going up.
You saved me.
Sure did. The name's...
- What's the catch?
- What?
What's it gonna cost me?
You're welcome, lady.
And how am I supposed
to get down from here now?!
Now, where'd
my creepy-Crawly get to?
High-Tech armor, huh?
You're gonna have to do
better than that.
Ok, that was better.
What were you doing
at the docks?
I want answers.
Batman?
You're real?
Turn it off.
- I had him.
- Clearly.
Now turn off the damn light
before they see us.
Before who sees us?
This is Gotham P.D.
Put your hands in the air.
Put your hands in the air.
They don't like us much.
The world's afraid of us.
You say that
like it's a good thing.
It's necessary.
Move!
Take your glow stick
and go home.
Gotham's mine.
No, see, this entire
space sector is my beat.
Uh-Huh.
I'm serious!
I'm Green Lantern, damn it!
What the hell did you do?
Cool.
So what's it doing in Gotham?
Witnesses spotted this thing
Trying to plant
some kind of bomb downtown.
When the cops confronted it,
it spewed fire from its mouth.
Yeah, I noticed,
but fire's no problem for me.
As I was saying,
Green Lantern can do anything.
Except shut up, apparently.
Wow. Someone forgot to take
their tru blood tonight.
I'm not a vampire.
- Seriously?
- I thought with the darkness
And the vanishing,
then the, what, super strength?
No.
- Can you fly?
- In a plane.
Wait. You're not just some guy
in a bat costume, are you?
Are you freaking kidding me?
What? Nobody asked you to prom,
So now you dress as a bat
And prowl around
your parents' basement?
What's this do?
Huh?
No buttons.
I assume it works
off concentration.
How'd you do that?
You weren't concentrating.
- You won't do that again.
- Unless I want to.
- That's it.
- Let's rumba, spooky.
Unh!
Shh.
- Hold fast.
- We need more info.
Bullcrap. That's a bomb,
and he just armed it.
Lantern, wait!
For Darkseid.
- Dark side?
- Wh-What's that, a band?
Some kind of death cry.
It wanted to take us with it,
All to protect this.
I'm on it.
Ring, scan and identify.
Initiating scan.
Processing.
Unable to identify.
That's impossible.
The ring knows
what the guardians know,
And the guardians
know everything.
It doesn't scan like a bomb,
More like an alien computer.
- Alien?
- Like the guy in metropolis?
Superman.
You've met him?
No,
But I've researched him.
His powers levels are...
Not gonna be a problem for me.
We'll see.
In the meantime,
We need to know more
about this thing.
Nothing on the markings
or the design, Sarah?
No, dr. Stone.
Dozens of tests,
And we're still unable
to learn a single thing.
We know less now
than when the flash
Brought it to us days ago.
Maybe we'll catch a break
with the metal scan.
You've been working
around the clock on this, Silas.
Perhaps if you got some rest.
I'll rest when we know
what this device is
And why that creature needed it
planted in central city.
Now what do we know?
It's broadcasting
some kind of signal,
And we've tracked
similar signals
Emitting from coast city,
Gotham, and metropolis.
Then it's talking to someone.
I should take this.
- Hi there, dr. Stone.
- I figured I'd see
If you had any further
information regarding the device
And the organism I left with you
a few days ago.
- Slow down, son.
- I can barely understand you.
Yeah, I get that sometimes.
We lost the creature.
It seemed engineered
to fall apart.
I see.
Any further data on the device?
Nothing yet. I should
know more in a few hours.
All right,
I'll check back with you then.
Flash, I can't help but suspect
I'm speaking
to a fellow scientist.
I'll catch up with you later,
dr. Stone.
Burritos are here!
- Hey!
- Can't even do that quickly.
- Where's my extra salsa?
- Finally.
'Bout time.
Way to take the "fast"
out of fast food, Barry.
Hey, guys,
someone took mine by mistake.
Chimichanga?
Guys?
- Tickets.
- Let's see your tickets.
My dad's got the tickets.
You mean your granddad?
Uh, yeah. What'd I say?
And one for your grandson?
What?
Hey!
Yeah!
Big man, you all right?
What's the play, Vic?
Here's what we're gonna do.
Gun, dice, right yo-yo.
Scat right "y" option on hard.
Break!
Admiral, admiral,
Check brown ox.
Red 98. Hut, hut!
Ha ha ha ha!
Next stop, nationals!
Ha ha! Vic stone is the bomb!
These freaks cost America
Over $100 million
in property damage.
Who's gonna pay for that?
Us regular people, that's who.
Diana, wait.
- It's Wonder Woman.
- It's her.
- In the flesh.
- Someone do something.
Oh, great.
I am Diana of paradise island.
Tell me who you speak of,
And, by Zeus,
they will taste my steel.
You gather to protest...
me?
You, what is
your problem with me?
You want the truth?
You swing that sword
with a smile,
And you scare normal people,
And you dress like a whore.
Yeah, he's right.
- He's right.
- Yeah.
Wha?!
This is not your truth.
The lasso compels you.
Now tell us your truth.
I cross-Dress
in a Wonder Woman outfit.
It makes me feel powerful.
Embrace your truth, my friend.
My outfit makes me
feel powerful, too.
We better get going.
Yes, off to see
this president you speak of.
Dad, it's just me.
Hey, I know how busy you are.
I just really thought you'd
keep your promise this time.
By the way, we won tonight.
Talk to you later. Love you.
Played a hell of game
today, victory.
- We're grabbing a slice.
- You down?
Nah. I gotta go see my dad.
Hey, you were in my dad's seat.
Didn't look like
he was using it.
You see a kid run through here?
Humph.
Thanks for that.
Yeah, don't sweat it.
Awesome game today.
Superstar Q.B. Victory stone
Brings in the win
single-Handedly.
Nah, not quite.
What do you mean? You threw
that last touchdown pass,
Like, 43 yards.
Doesn't matter
if there's not someone
On the other end
to make the catch.
Must be nice to trust
someone else that much.
Hey, I should go.
Nice meeting you, victory.
Tell your dad
he's got some great seats.
Yeah, I will.
Hey, where's my...
Son of a...
yes!
Victory! Victory!
Superman's close.
I've been tracking
his flight path.
On what, your own satellite?
I was kidding.
You have a satellite?
Here he comes.
First one to the building is...
Uhh. I really hate that guy.
Wait here.
I got this.
No offense.
You'd just get in the way.
Here's the plan.
Green Lantern
kicks Superman's ass.
Tmz's got the video.
Aah!
So what can you do?
I can still see you.
The creature that attacked me
had one of those boxes you have.
A friend of yours, I assume.
He blew up,
So I'll ask you.
What are these boxes for?
Talk while you still can.
Trying to.
Round 2, flyboy.
Lantern, no!
Chains?
You're funny.
We won't stop him.
He's pissed off.
We have to talk to him.
Talk to him?
Lantern, focus.
You stop concentrating,
and that shield breaks apart.
Shut up.
This guy's gonna kill us.
- No, he won't.
- You bruise, but you don't kill,
Do you...
Clark?
You've made your point...
Heh. Bruce Wayne.
Who the hell is Bruce Wayne?
We think it's alien.
Well, it's not kryptonian.
Worth a shot.
- Hey, hey, what happened?
- We're done fighting?
Alien is relative, by the way.
It's a big universe.
Let's move.
Man, what is it
with you and sewers?
Someone is strategically placing
these boxes.
We have to find out who
and why before it's too late.
Desaad,
what do you have to report
From our agents on earth?
Sire, the powerful one
has found a mother box,
The one they
mistakenly call Superman.
And?
These defenders have
sprung up like antibodies
To protect their planet.
We are in danger of losing
The element of surprise,
my lord.
I humbly ask that you
move up your timetable.
Let the invasion begin.
We're maxed at power ceiling.
Cycle the pulses.
Dr. Stone,
Your son is here.
- I don't have time right now.
- Do it again.
Make time.
Victor, I'm in the middle
Of some very important work.
You mean
more important than me.
That's not what I said.
There were scouts there
today, dad.
They offered me a full ride,
all of them.
I told you
I'll pay for college.
You don't need to be sniffing
after a scholarship.
That's not the point.
They think I can hold my own
with the best of the best.
Why don't you?
Open your eyes, son.
Look at the world
we live in today.
We are witnessing the birth
of a new race of Superhumans,
Beings who can fly,
tear through buildings,
And outrun race cars.
They will make
what you can do obsolete.
In that world,
throwing a football is a joke.
You're never gonna come
to one of my games, are you?
No.
Dr. Stone,
something's happening.
We can talk about this later.
- So why are you two here?
- Metropolis is my turf.
There have been reports of mysterious
kidnappings across the country.
We had 'em here, too.
Figured that was life
in the big city.
You think the disappearances
and these things are connected?
They're connected.
So these monsters, they're...
they're soldiers,
expendable soldiers at that,
Planting these devices
at all costs.
That's military tactics.
We might be
staring down the barrel
Of a full-Scale invasion.
You're paranoid.
Let's just crack it open
and see what happens.
Hey!
Without any idea what's inside?
That's idiotic.
Heh. I'll show you idiotic.
Ahh! I didn't touch it.
It's activated itself.
It's transmitting.
Silas, look at these readings.
I am not letting you
walk away from me again, dad.
We're having this out.
Can we trace the power source?
I'm trying to lock in
on the signal now.
This thing
is more important to you
Than your own son?
Victor, stop!
It's gonna blow!
Aah!
You're welcome.
Still think I'm paranoid?
Ah, maybe a little less now.
We need to get out of here now.
Which way?
We have to get him
into the red room.
Sarah!
I'm not leaving you, victor.
Don't you dare leave me.
I don't believe it.
His vitals are there, Silas.
He's alive.
Dad.
Yes, victor. I'm here.
Ahh. It hurts so bad.
It's going to hurt.
It's not gonna be easy, but...
Whatever that energy is,
It's eating him
from the inside out.
He's going into cardiac arrest.
It's racing up his spinal cord.
Then we can't wait.
But, Silas, the risk.
What choice so I have, morrow?
This room contains technology
recovered from across the globe.
I've studied and logged
nearly everything in here.
I've taken apart
and rebuilt most of it.
It can save my son's life.
It has to.
- He's in pain.
- You have to do something.
The pain will subside
as soon as the promethium
Finishes replacing
the damaged tissue.
Promethium skin grafts?
His body could
reject them completely.
It won't.
I've injected the nanites.
Activate them.
- They're untested.
- We recovered them from...
Do it!
Aah!
Out of the way,
you freaky bimbo!
Cool. You're Wonder Woman.
My name is Diana.
Mine's Hannah grace.
Thank you for speaking
with me, Hannah.
You're not afraid of me.
Nah. I wanna be you
when I get big.
I would welcome
your sisterhood, Hannah.
What are you eating?
Ice cream.
Is it good?
It's the greatest food
in the world,
If you ask me.
Aww.
I will try some ice cream,
And another
for my friend Hannah.
Whatever you say, lady.
Just don't, you know,
take my arm with it.
Eh, here.
Ice cream is wonderful!
Told you so.
You should be very proud
of this achievement.
Um, thanks?
I lost him.
I promised his mother
I'd protect him,
But I failed.
What's going on?
Diana.
Steve, have you
ever had ice cream?
This cook is truly blessed.
You need to come back
to the white house.
You sound like my mother.
The president only has
a few minutes to meet you.
I grew weary of waiting
for him, so I left.
This is Hannah.
Very pleased to meet you.
Could you excuse us, Hannah?
You can't walk out
like that, Diana.
You're a political envoy.
I am a warrior.
With responsibilities.
Besides, I happen to know
Where they make the best
homemade ice cream in D.C.,
If you're interested.
Oh. I could compel you
to disclose this secret.
Or I could just take you there.
There is
my true responsibility,
Combat. Leave them to me.
Upload initiated.
Completed.
Recalibrating memory.
What's happening?
Stay calm, son.
It's gonna be all right.
- Hey, dr. Stone. I...
- We're in trouble!
Offensive mode activated.
Aah!
Victor!
I came as quick as I could.
Offensive mode...
White noise cannon enabled.
Lantern, plug that hole.
Yeah, yeah. I got this.
Concentrate.
Your constructs are fading.
Your mind is scattered.
Worry about yourself.
You're the one without powers.
We need to take a step back
and regroup.
There's too many of them
just to barrel through.
Yeah?
Tell that to Superman. Ohh!
Come on.
That's it.
Smile for me.
- Mayday. Mayday.
- The capital is under attack.
And there goes our big gun.
Fantãstico.
Aw, come on.
Can't a guy get any privacy?
Football. Told you so.
Well, we had to be certain.
I was so worried
about you, Billy.
- You don't have to be.
- For real.
I like your jersey.
Oh, yeah? I stole it.
You did not. You're funny.
We worry
every time you disappear,
You know, like a family would.
Foster family.
This time was the worst.
You've heard the reports, right?
There's an invasion of monsters.
They're grabbing people
off the streets.
And you morons believe that?
Jerk.
Come and get some, ugly.
Shazam!
They're being
overcautious, hon.
We'll be fine.
I need eyes up, pronto.
We're under siege.
Repeat, the president
is under siege.
Aah!
Mr. President.
It's nice to finally meet you.
I am Diana.
But you may call me...
Wonder woman. Thank goodness.
We've lost an engine!
Julian!
Aah!
Are we ok? What's going on?
By the gods.
You're strong.
I know.
Can't feel my hand.
Can't feel anything.
What's happened to me?
Your mind is now
a quantum computer, son.
There's buzzing in my ears.
Make it stop, please.
I can't.
At least you're alive.
Uhh. You call this living,
This half-Man, half-Machine?
This is what it took for you
to finally care about me?
You had to make me just
another one of your experiments.
Don't you hear the buzzing?
- You know what?
- I think I am needed downtown,
And you two clearly
need to talk, so I'll just,
Uh... Yeah.

Excuse me, but this is the hole
These wigglers
crawled out of, right?
Vic stone?
What the hell happened to you?
That wasn't so hard.
Looks like
you could use a hand.
Flash! My boy.
Great to see you.
Oh, yeah, and that's batman.
Batman's real?
Yeah. He's over there.
Wait. What?
It is a real honor to meet you,
sir, batman,
Sir ba... Batman, sir.
- Don't bother.
- The guy's a total tool.
I've followed your efforts
in central city, Flash.
You do tight, efficient work.
Hey, Barry, you, uh, got
a little something on your nose.
Get ready. Here they come.
For Darkseid!
Hah!
Holy...
Greetings, warriors.
Dibs.
Hi.
Ah, it's good to be back
in the heat of war.
Yeah, you better run.
No, they're assembling,
Waiting for whoever's behind
this to launch the attack.
All right. Now what?
I don't know.
Incoming!
Mine.
Defense mode activated.
Damn it.
You're done.
No! I'm not with them!
- Hold on. I can vouch for that.
- He was at S.T.A.R. Labs.
Huh?
Hey there. What's up?
Shazam.
I'm with him.
He's not with me.
And who the hell
are you supposed to be,
Mr. Roboto?
- Who I am doesn't matter.
- What I know does.
Which is?
I've...
talked to their technology.
I know their plan.
They're terraforming the earth.
It's about to get ugly.
- That fits.
- How do you figure?
Well, for one thing,
The water's on fire.
What are they doing with them?
Can't be sure, but I know this.
They're not killing anyone.
They're harvesting them.
This isn't
an isolated incident either.
It's happening
across the world.
We're too late. He's here.
I'm guessing
that's the bad guy.
Lucky guess.
Hmm. He doesn't look
that tough.
No.
I am entropy.
I am death.
I am Darkseid.
Stand back
and peep the light show.
Green Lantern's got this.
That all you got?
Not all I got.
Uhh. I'm not through with you.
Aah!
Is that your boyfriend?
No.
Cool. Watch this.
Hey, blackheart the deatheater
Or whatever your
"World of Warcraft" name is,
Suck on this!
Aah!
Now what?
Now you die.
Wait! No!
We're gonna have to move fast.
Not a problem for me.
- They're splitting up.
- They can do that?
- They're locked on us.
- Come on, Barry.
You're moving fast,
so think fast.
Whew. Never had to catch
my breath before.
Oh, no. Superman.
Aah!
Finally,
the kryptonian is ours.
Master will be pleased.
- They flew off with him.
- I saw it. They took Superman.
I'll get him.
Lantern!
Ahh.
Out of my way, batman.
Your arm is broken, you idiot.
- I can handle this.
- Get out of my way.
- You're gonna die.
- Then I die.
What are you trying to prove?
I'm not trying
to prove anything,
You phenomenal douche bag.
Don't act like you know me.
You don't.
We're just somewhat alike.
We are nothing alike.
We're fighting alongside
an alien, an Amazon,
A human lightning bolt,
a cyborg, and a speedster.
Far as I can tell, Hal,
you and I
Are the only normal people here.
I never told you my name.
Saw it on your flight suit.
You're pretty
south of normal, spooky.
You know that, right?
My name is Bruce Wayne.
When I was 10, my parents were
murdered in front of my eyes.
I've spent my life
training to fight
The same sort of criminals
that took them from me,
But this, this is different.
This isn't about me.
Uh, you're telling me this why?
This is bigger than I am,
and it's bigger than you are.
Get out of your own way.
Focus on what's important here,
everyone else.
Regroup with the others.
- And do what, exactly?
- You're loud.
They'll listen to you
if you got something to say.
Try to at least sound smart.
Keep them alive.
Keep Darkseid busy
till I get back.
Get back? From where?
We won't win
without our big gun.
Where the hell are you going?
Hey!
I'm going to get Superman.
Bruce Wayne, huh?
Moron's crazier than I am.
You guys ok? Good.
Listen up
Uh...
ahem!
We need to, uh...
We need to play offense
Instead of all
coming up to bat.
Um, what?
I apologize,
but I don't know your games.
I think what lantern is saying
Is that it's time
for some teamwork,
So let's pull it together.
Yeah, baby! Clap it up!
What's the plan, then?
Well...
he blasts those beams
out of his eyes, right?
- It's settled, then.
- We blind him.
That's as good a plan
as any, yeah.
We follow,
and we stay out of sight.
I'll turn on the fireworks
to get his attention.
Princess, you get
in striking distance
And stab that son of a bitch
in the eyes.
Like poor damned Oedipus.
Yeah, what
the hot Greek chick said.
And the invasion of monsters
raining from the sky?
What about them?
I might be able to send them
Back where they came from.
Good enough for me.
Here we go, team.
We got this!
"We got this"?
That's your big battle cry?
Don't worry about it,
smartass. Stick to the plan.
This is awesome.
Like that parker game
in overtime,
Where you ran the ball
the last...
All right, who are you,
and how do you know me?
What? I'm a fan.
Everyone around here
knows victory stone.
I'm not that guy anymore.
- Sure you are.
- I'm not.
I'm a terminator, an android,
Some kind of cyborg.
Now I'm gonna have to worry
About operating systems
and computer viruses.
Spoiler... You won't get
to do any of that stuff
If this guy eats the world.
Don't you get it?
I don't have a place
anywhere anymore.
Looks to me like
your place is with us.
The parademon hives on earth
Were ill-Equipped to process
your flesh, my prize.
But here
in my personal laboratory,
I can splice
your kryptonian genetic code
To create a new form,
A super parademon
in the service of Darkseid.
And once we have our champion,
We will seize the other supers
and break them as well.
All hail Darkseid.
Ok, remember,
I'll distract him...
- Darkseid!
- What the...
Get him out of there.
His showboating is
gonna ruin the entire plan.
Oh, great. Now I'm batman.
- What's the big deal?
- I had him.
- Dude, you had squat.
- We had a plan.
Heads up, guys!
You are a warrior, not a child.
Act like it.
Yes, ma'am.
Now follow me to victory!
She digs me.
Attack!
True, the metamorphosis
is painful,
But soon you will never
feel anything ever again.
What? I didn't send for you.
Let him go.
I am impressed by your
resourcefulness, earthling,
But once the transformative
process is set in motion,
Nothing can stop it.
Your friend is gone.
With the help
of the kryptonian,
I'll see to it that your world
Will be just another
that has fallen to Darkseid.
And what if you never see it?
You wouldn't.
Wouldn't you?
Welcome, my children.
Protect your... Hunh! Unh!
Uhh!
Hey, Darkseid, eat this!
Come on, giant.
I'm getting bored.
This world is mine.
One down. One to go.
His knife was on the left side,
Making him right-Handed,
Which means
the power must be here.
Aah!
Yah!
Now, Flash,
take out the other eye!
Sorry. I need this to save the world.
Thanks for your help.
Did that work?
Yeah, I think that worked.
Superman!
You need to fight
whatever they're doing to you.
We need you, Clark.
The world needs Clark Kent.
Yaah!
Both eyeballs blown out,
and he's still standing.
What else can we do?
Try and send him home.
How?
Darkseid is transferring data
to those metal cubes.
They call them mother boxes.
They're creating portals,
boom tubes.
I just have to speak
their language.
I didn't understand
a single word you just said.
Connecting to network.
Unable to connect.
Got to get some altitude.
Connection established.
Get him in there.
I'll crush you like a nut.
Yaah!
How dare you?
I am Darkseid!
I don't care.
Kick his ass!
- Now, kid.
- Slam the door in his face.
Unable to connect.
Damn it.
Yaah!
Error. Error.
The computer is not responding.
Come on, you stupid machine.
Work!
Network connected.
Yes.
Insufficient energy.
Shit.
It's programmed,
But I don't have
the juice to push it.
I need a huge blast of power.
Shouldn't be a problem.
Shazam!
Kryptonian,
you are coming with me.
Ohh. Like hell, I am.
Initiating boom tube closure.
Got you!
Hey, you're that kid.
Hell of a catch, man.
Thanks.
Don't tell them, ok?
It's none of their
freaking business.
It'll be our secret.
I always said you had
an arm like a cannon.
Now you totally do.
Nice job, kid.
Where'd Shazam go?
He took off,
Said he had a hot date.
Right. Who'd go out
with that immature hothead?
What about the human victims?
I can see them.
Let me just get this baby
to boom for me one more time.
I got this.
He's good for cleanup,
at least.
How do we keep
Darkseid from returning?
All those mother boxes
are fried.
Then they won't be able
to get back anytime soon.
It's a start.
Heads up.
There they are.
We should leave before
they blame us again. Ugh.
You guys are amazing.
What's your hurry, Flash?
Today marks a momentous day
in human history.
In our darkest hour,
these superheroes
Donned their
colorful costumes...
- costume?
- Took to the streets...
- this is my uniform.
- Quiet.
Oh, now you wanna bark orders?
After I did the heavy lifting
and pulled everyone together.
You're referring to when you
botched my very simple directives
And Wonder Woman led the charge?
Cyborg showed you a video?
He e-Mailed it to me.
I really hate you, bats.
I can't believe people
are no longer afraid of us.
Or that they think
we're a team.
We're not a team.
But I am pleased to meet
some folks who get me.
Yes, it was good to walk
among a pantheon again.
How do you mean?
Hades, Apollo,
Hermes, Hephaestus, Zeus,
Each a god in their own right.
And me?
I have never met
anyone like you, Superman,
God or mortal.
...At this time.
Is it by chance, by fate,
Or are there
bigger forces at work?
Is our modern
technological age...
I shouldn't be up here.
- Are you kidding me?
- Of course you should. We won.
Be proud.
Your dad looks like he is.
...In fact,
the way of all people,
Working for
a free and peaceful planet.
As we have seen...
by the way, man,
Thanks for not talking
about the other thing.
Don't sweat it,
And thanks
for seeing me in here.
- What?
- You're the bomb, victory.
- I know. I know.
- You keep reminding me.
Victory. Victory.
Victory.
These super friends
Used their superpowers
to protect us...
and we're not friends either.
- We let them think we're both.
- Why?
- It'll keep Gotham P.D.
- Off my back,
The air force off yours.
I don't know. A team?
I've got a lot
of responsibilities.
As do I.
Well, I have a whole universe
To protect, people,
so there you go.
- Come on.
- We can do it together.
Yeah? Can you fly into space?
I can.
Not my point. Look,
We are not friends.
We're not a team.
I don't agree, Hal.
I kind of liked
being a part of something.
Yeah, you would.
Listen, this was just
a one-Time deal, ok?
And what if something
like this should happen again?
- Please.
- What could possibly happen?
That said, I am very pleased
To introduce to you...
Gee, I didn't even ask.
Do you guys have a name?
- Yes, we do.
- We do?
- That's right.
- You can call us...
the super seven.
Please don't call us that.
- Hera help us.
- The super seven?
What? You don't like it?
The surface dwellers
have killed our king.
This is an act of war,
and they will pay.
