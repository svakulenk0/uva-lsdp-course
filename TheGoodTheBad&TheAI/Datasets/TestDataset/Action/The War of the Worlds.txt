It did not occur to mankind that a
- Is that a fireball or something?
- Boy, that's big.
- I wonder where it hit?
- Probably halfway to Pomona.
I'm gonna see. Who's coming?
This is Pine Summit. I got a smoke.
- 160l30.
- Azimuth: 160 degrees, 30 minutes.
Big? I bet it's as big as anything
that ever lit in California.
Better get something over there.
It's started a blaze already.
Number Three to D.O.
-
- We're getting this under control.
- Someone ought to check on it.
-
It's too hot to get near enough
for a good look, but it's enormous.
I got a message for you. You're the
guys from Pacific Tech, ain't you?
- Looks like the fishing was good.
- Have some?
Well, I might just do that.
It's about that meteor.
They say it's a whopper.
They phoned us up on the summit.
I thought you might be interested.
- About 10 miles from here.
- It didn't come down like a meteor.
That's right.
It came down in spurts.
You fellows figure it out.
You're scientists.
It's big as a house and red-hot.
- I'll borrow your car and take a look.
- We ought to get back.
- I'll fly Bilder back down in your plane.
- Okay, the insurance is paid up.
- Light?
- No, I'll smoke it later.
Did you watch it come down?
I saw it from my window.
Harold, look here a minute.
Step over a little. Smile.
It must have skidded along the gully.
Then the loose earth
shook down over it.
- I guess most of it's buried.
- That's  feet thick.
They run heavy. They won't be able
to haul this one away to no museum.
A good attraction for Sunday drivers.
Better than a lion farm or
snake pit. We won't have to feed it.
- We can sell tamales and hot dogs.
- Ice cream, cold drinks, souvenirs.
- We should put up picnic tables.
- Then they'd bring their own lunch.
- Gonna dig for gold, Buck?
- You think you're kidding?
It’ll be like having a gold mine
in your own back yard.
I'm gonna get a closer look at it.
- That's it over there.
- It's still pretty darned hot.
- Be careful, Buck.
- Watch it.
- Did you see it come down?
- Yes, I was fishing in the hills.
- That's a lot of tackle.
- The others flew back in my plane.
Why didn't it make a bigger crater?
It hit sideways and skidded in.
That's what I think.
A scientist's coming, he'll tell us.
- Ever hear of Clayton Forrester?
- What's that fellow trying to do?
He's top man in astro and nuclear
physics. He knows all about meteors.
- You seem to know all about him.
- I did a thesis on modern scientists.
- Did it do you any good?
- Sure, I got my degree.
- Say, do you have a match?
- No, I'm sorry. I don't smoke.
They had Forrester on the cover of
Time. You have to rate to get that.
- He isn't that good.
- You don't even know him!
- I do know him, slightly.
- What's he like?
Well, he's like...
You don't look like yourself in that
get-up, but I'm happy to meet you.
Sylvia Van Buren.
I teach library science at USC.
- I didn't know how to stop you.
- You didn't wear glasses in Time.
They're for long distance. To look
at something close, I take them off.
- You could fry eggs on that thing.
- The sand is keeping the heat in.
Uncle, Dr Forrester. Dr Matthew
Collins is the pastor here.
- Well, how do you do?
- How do you do, sir?
Hey, you!
What have you got in here?
It's ticking like a bomb.
This is a Geiger counter
for detecting radioactivity.
- It's that meteor.
- It's radioactive?
Yes. It's difficult to account
for a reaction like that.
- Look at it. It's going crazy!
- Maybe we should keep people away.
I'll post a few deputies.
That meteor is either very light,
which is unheard of, or it's hollow.
If it were heavy and solid, it would
have made a tremendous crater.
I'll wait around until it cools off.
Is there a place I could clean up?
- I'd like you to stay at my house.
- Thank you.
It won't be cool for  hours. What
do people do here on a Saturday?
- Not much of anything.
- There's a square dance tonight.
Allemande left and the ladies star.
Gents walk around, but not too far.
Allemande left and the gentlemen star.
Ladies walk around, but not too far.
First and third balance and swing.
Promenade the outside ring.
Three quarters round the outside ring.
Through that couple and not too far.
Meet in the centre with right hand star.
Swing your corner with left hand round.
Let's take another look at it.
- It's almost cold now.
- We might as well go home.
- No sense staying out here.
- Let's go.
Hey, it's moving!
- It's a bomb!
- It didn't go off last night...
- Maybe it's gonna go off now.
- It's a sneak attack. Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Bombs don't unscrew.
It's no meteor. That's for sure.
Darnedest thing I ever saw,
the way that's unscrewing.
- Thank you, Doctor. Having fun?
- You know what I was thinking?
The energy from one square dance
could send the meteor back home.
- Must be somebody in there.
- Who? Where do they come from?
I read that Mars is near Earth now.
It happens every  years, they say.
Men from Mars...
- What do you think?
- Maybe these are not men, like us.
Everything human doesn't
have to look like you and me.
If it's men from Mars, we ought to
let them know we're friendly.
- No, you don't know what it is.
- We'd be the first to make contact.
We'd be in all the papers.
We could walk out there
with a white flag.
I got an old sugar sack in my car.
What are we going to say to them?
"Welcome to California."
Come on.
We're friends!
Open up!
- How will they understand us?
- We'll talk in sign language.
Everybody understands that the white
flag means we want to be friends.
- Hey there, open up!
- Come on out, we're friends!
- We welcome you!
- We're friends!
No smooching in the dark, folks.
- Any candles around?
- All the lights in town are out.
- Somebody found some candles.
- I like it in the dark.
Call the electric company
and see what happened.
- Hey, the phone's gone dead.
- The phone isn't on the same circuit.
What are they saying? Something's
wrong with my hearing aid.
We play "Good Night Ladies" at
midnight, anyway. It's near that now.
- My watch has stopped.
- I've got the time.
- Mine's stopped, too.
- Mine ain't working. What is this?
They've all stopped
at the same time.
There's only one explanation for a
thing like this. Do you have a pin?
See that? My watch is magnetised.
That's what
knocked the phones out, too.
- But everyone's watches all together?
- Do you have a pocket compass?
- The needle isn't pointing north.
- It's pointing toward the meteor.
Let me through!
- What's going on?
- I don't know any more than you do.
Look at the fire out there!
The power lines are down.
That explains why the lights went out.
- Hey, look at the cars!
- Where are the three men you left?
Look there!
People in town started to follow us.
Don't let them come near here.
Get under cover!
- What is that gizmo?
- A machine from another planet.
We'd better get word
to the authorities. Look!
Sheriff, you'd better get word
to the military. You'll need them.
Get moving. On the double.
Take cover along the riverbed.
Get those 30s over here.
The area is controlled by Marines.
The gully is surrounded.
Here is Prof. McPherson of Canada.
Is it true you've had reports
of landings in other places? Canada?
Not in Canada yet, but in
Bordeaux, France. Some in Spain...
There's supposed to be one
down in Italy.
We're trying to locate the second
meteor that landed here at midnight.
- Do you think they come from Mars?
- Dr Forrester?
It's possible. It seems certain
they're from some other planet.
-
-
Thank you, Doctor. Colonel, can you
tell us anything about this plane?
It’ll drop a flare. Then Air Force
cameramen will get pictures.
There's been a lot of mysterious
activity around the machine.
Lights and dust, as if they're digging
themselves out. There it comes again!
If it keeps up,
it'll be a guide for the plane.
The pilot's just blipped his motor.
That means he's dropped the flare.
We'll be the first men on Earth to get a
real look at these invaders from space.
They're after the plane with their rays!
Jump for it!
Here we are...
Hey, they cut me off!
They got my truck!
They'll come out of the gully soon.
Our defences have to be ready.
- You'll need plenty of reinforcements.
- We'll get them.
- The troops are certainly moving in.
- You sent word to the 6th Army?
No, Col. Heffner's in charge.
You never know where you'll wind up
when you go to a square dance.
- That's D-24.
- Correct.
Locate your observation post
on this hill.
Position your recoilless 75s
back here. Carbon Canyon.
I want your battery here. In daylight you
may be exposed. Be ready to pull out.
- But you'll get first crack at them.
- Suits me, sir.
Heffner...
Half-tracks? Okay.
Get in back of Hill Three.
If it's a moving target,
follow up from there. Over and out.
They've located that second meteor.
There's one, there's the other.
We're right between them.
- So is the town.
- I warned them to prepare to evacuate.
Everyone has been alerted.
- Gen. Mann, I was told to expect you.
- I'm here to report back, not interfere.
Clayton Forrester,
I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
This is Pastor Collins,
Sheriff Bogany, head of local control.
- Miss Van Buren.
- Would you care for some coffee?
Gen. Mann's in charge of intelligence
for the Pacific area.
You've certainly got them surrounded.
- They've neutralised communications?
- Not all. The field phones are okay.
A cylinder reported by Huntington
Beach. That's a job for the Navy.
- Any news from abroad?
- We're in touch with their militaries.
They're coming down all over.
Santiago has two cylinders.
They're outside London.
They're  Naples.
We've got them between here
and Fresno. Two on Long Island.
- They're coming down at random.
- No.
According to information from foreign
sources, they have some kind of plan.
What it is isn't clear yet, because
once they begin to move,
no more news comes out of that area.
We've had reports
of destruction, massacre.
"Town south of Bordeaux
wiped out by ray."
"Local reports say nothing remains."
What do you make of that?
- All we've seen is their heat ray.
- Our newest weapons will stop them.
From the data, and that picture
the Air Force took tonight,
this is the original pilot ship.
Its observations
guided the others down.
One lands, then two, making groups
of three joined magnetically.
My orders are not to go into action
unless they move out of the gully.
This is the only place
we have them contained.
What happens here will be a guide
to other operations.
When it starts, and a defence pattern
develops, I'll report to Washington.
- You've deployed your forces well.
- We'll blast them right off Earth.
They'll probably move at dawn.
There's something moving
in the gully.
Look at it.
Beings from another world.
- Is it a flying machine?
- No.
It's supported from the ground by rays.
Probably some form of magnetic flux.
This is amazing!
They must keep the opposing poles
in balance and lift the machine.
Stand by to fire.
All command posts, stand by to fire.
- But Colonel, shooting's no good.
- It's always been a good persuader.
Shouldn't you try communicating with
them first,  shoot, if you have to?
Target as indicated.
We should try to make them
understand we mean them no harm.
There's another machine coming out!
They are living creatures.
They're not human.
They're an advanced civilisation.
If they're more advanced than us,
they should be nearer the Creator.
No real attempt has been made
to communicate with them.
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
I've done all I can in there.
You go back. Sylvia...
I like that Dr Forrester.
He's a good man.
Attention all batteries:
Prepare for volley fire.
Who's that?
What is he doing?
- Uncle! Stop him!
- It's too late. He's too far away.
Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
It's seen him.
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
And I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever...
- Let 'em have it!
- Fire!
The shells can't get through. They've
put up an electromagnetic covering.
That skeleton beam must be what
they used to wipe out the French city.
Cut across their lines of magnetic force
and any object will cease to exist.
Take my word for it, General.
This defence is useless against them.
You'd better
let Washington know. Fast.
Hold them as long as you can.
Order all command posts to pull back
north of the tunnel bunker.
Everybody out of here! The Air Force
will take care of these babies now.
Dr Forrester, get out of here.
Everybody out...
- Can't you go higher?
- The air will be full of jets in a minute.
Read all about the Martian invasion.
They're in New York and Miami.
Fighting outside Los Angeles.
Read all about it.
- Hold it right there, General.
- What do you think of the situation?
- Do you believe we can hold them?
- Sorry, I've no time.
Break it up.
The way he's hedging, maybe we
didn't hold them. I've heard news.
Australia, India...
Nobody's stopped them yet.
- If the city must be evacuated...
- Many have already moved out.
- We've mobilised cars and buses.
- The Red Cross is standing by.
The enemy
is 30 miles outside Los Angeles.
Not in full force yet, but developing.
It can happen any minute.
- Washington is on the line, sir.
- General Mann.
I'd say our effective losses
were 60% men, 90% material.
The jets went in but none came out.
Bombers were knocked out of the sky,
and their bombs did nothing.
Their electronic umbrella
is quite impenetrable.
Forrester thinks they generate atomic
force without the screening we use.
Very well, sir.
Get me the fastest plane we've got.
Now I'll make a statement
to those reporters.
All right,
the general will see you now.
We heard Forrester was out with you.
What does he think about this?
- Ask him. He's back at Pacific Tech.
- No, he's not. He hasn't shown up.
Wake up.
Let's get moving.
- Are you all right?
- It's that machine!
It's gone.
We're south-west of Corona.
There must have been another cylinder
down here. They cleared everyone out.
There's a farmhouse out there.
Let's find something to eat.
We're doing all right.
I almost forgot when I ate last.
That looks good. Mostly I get my meals
in coffee shops and restaurants.
- Don't you live at home?
- No, on campus. I haven't any family.
I come from a big one. There's nine
of us, all in Minnesota. Except me.
I have no close folks.
My parents died when I was a kid.
A big family must be fun. It must make
you feel you belong to something.
It does. Maybe that's why
I feel lost right now.
We'll get out safely. Don't worry.
They murder everything that moves.
If they're mortal, they have mortal
weaknesses. They'll be stopped.
I haven't been close enough to them
for any real observation.
I feel like I did once when I was small.
Awful scared and lonesome.
I'd wandered off. I've forgotten why.
The family and whole crowds
of neighbours were hunting for me.
They found me in a church.
I was afraid to go in anyplace else.
I stayed by that door, praying for
the one who loved me best to find me.
- It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
- I liked him.
He liked you.
Oh, I could bawl my head off.
But you won't, you're not the kind.
You're tired. You've been up all night.
You crashed in a plane, slept in a ditch.
You want to know something?
It doesn't show on you at all.
Get down!
- How long was I out?
- Hours. I've been so scared!
They're right outside.
Several of them came down together.
There's a machine standing
right alongside of us.
An electronic eye.
Like a television camera.
It's looking for us.
Maybe they're not too sure we're here.
They could be as curious about us
as we are about them.
Maybe they want to take us alive.
It's pulling out.
Can't we get out of here?
- Something moved out there.
- There's nothing there now.
- It was one of them!
- What was it like?
- I couldn't see much in the dark.
- I've got to get a good look at them.
- They've blocked it!
- It's blocked here, too.
They've pushed earth
all around the outside.
Here, this is the way up to the attic.
Look out!
Your scarf.
It's wet.
Blood...
Stop it. Stop it!
We've got to make a run for it.
Come on!
It's vital to prevent the Martian
machines from linking up.
Once they do, they adopt
an extraordinary military tactic.
They form a crescent,
anchor it at one end
and sweep on
until they've cleared a quadrant.
Then they anchor the opposite end
and reverse direction.
They slash across country, wiping out
everything that's trying to evade them.
That's why communications are cut
once they begin moving.
- Montreal's blacked out. Nothing.
- Same thing as on the Pacific coast.
- Anything from them yet?
- Still nothing from San Francisco.
- Here's that Los Angeles picture, sir.
- This is a sonic radar picture.
It shows details of the Martian nest
outside Los Angeles.
Their machines appear as round blobs.
Newly fallen cylinders are elongated.
There are three cylinders to each
group, three machines to each cylinder.
All right, I've seen enough.
Only one thing will stop them. We've
held back because of the radiation.
Now there's no choice. Washington will
confirm an order to use the atom bomb.
Our first target will be
the initial landing place outside L.A.
Have Pacific Tech monitor the drop.
I'll have the area cleared all around.
We can still hit them before dark.
We'll blast them all over the world.
- We've been looking all over for you.
- We walked half-way from Corona.
This is Miss Van Buren. Dr Grotzman,
Dr Pryor, James, Bilderbeck.
- What's this about the A-bomb?
- We're going in right after it.
- What's that?
- An electronic eye.
They modelled it after their own eye.
They use it the way we use a periscope.
- It'll tell us about their metals.
- We can find out about their optics.
- Very interesting.
- And this... the blood of a Martian.
I don't remember ever seeing
blood crystals as anaemic as these.
They may be mental giants,
but by our standards, physically,
they must be very primitive.
Everything about them
seems to be in threes.
Their eyes have three lenses,
three pupils. Strong light shocks them.
Sunlight on Mars is approximately
half as strong as we get it.
Add their clouds and dust,
it amounts to no more than our twilight.
Now, if you'll step over here, please.
We've rigged the epidiascope to reflect
whatever the Martian lens picks up.
Move in a little. Thank you.
There's how the Martians see us.
Evidently there's a shift
in their spectrum.
Their colour absorption
must be different from ours.
Let's see why they were so curious
about you, Miss Van Buren.
- Time we got started, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
- Let's make an analysis of their blood.
- It might give us something.
You can get all the Martian blood you
want after the plane drops the bomb.
The Flying Wing is going to carry it.
Tower, this is Flying Wing,
ready for take-off.
Wish us luck.
The target is the nest of
Martian machines in the Puente Hills,
where more cylinders came down
last evening.
A plane will pinpoint the target
from six miles up.
This bomb is ten times more powerful
than anything previously used.
It's the latest thing in nuclear fission.
Nothing like it has ever been exploded
before. We're going to be pretty close,
but there are observers in a forward
bunker who will be a lot nearer than us.
The whole world is waiting.
This will decide the fate of civilisation.
Whether we live or die
may depend on what happens here.
There must be a couple of million
people behind us in the hills,
waiting to find out
whether they can go home again.
All around the world, people
have been driven from their homes.
Direct cable communication
is being maintained with Washington,
but there's no radio at all. Not even
with the bomber that's coming over.
All radio is dead,
which means that these recordings
are for the sake of future history, if any.
Future history, he said.
Yes, if any.
Bilderbeck's calculated how long
we have until they take over the world.
If the A-bomb fails, the Martians
can conquer Earth in six days.
The same number of days
it took to create it.
There's the plane.
We've sighted the plane, sir.
-
- Look. Look!
They're using
those protective blisters again.
...5, 4, 3,  1.
Hello? What can you see?
There's something moving!
They haven't even been touched!
It didn't stop them. Guns, tanks, bombs,
they're like toys against them!
It’ll end only one way.
We're beaten.
No... Not yet.
Washington ordered all cities in danger
of attack evacuated if the bomb fails.
They'll be moving on Los Angeles now.
We'll fight them back to the mountains.
Our best hope lies in what you people
can develop to help us.
Six days, you said. Six days...
They'll stamp the city flat.
We'll establish a base laboratory
in the Rocky Mountains.
- We'll search out their weaknesses.
- A forlorn hope.
- But there  a chance.
- We may get a lead from the blood.
- By some biological approach?
- We can't beat their machines.
We've got to beat
Keep them rolling!
Come on!
- Gratzman, did you get those biotics?
- No, I thought you had them.
I'll get them. You get in the school bus.
Sylvia will drive you.
Let me up. I'll give you $500
for your place. I'll make it $1,000.
Money's no good anymore!
Here comes another truck!
Throw that guy off there!
Stop, you fools!
You fools!
- Quick, we've got to stop them!
- The law's no good here now.
- The thieves stayed behind.
- It's like this all over.
They must be stopped.
The instruments!
Hold it a minute!
We've got to have those instruments.
They're our only chance!
Did they grab the trucks ahead of me?
Did you see the Pacific Tech people?
I don't know. There's fighting all over.
- Did they get the school bus?
- If they saw it, they took it.
You can't buy a ride for love or money!
Gratzman! Bilderbeck!
Sylvia!
- Hey, you better get out of here!
- I'm looking for Pacific Tech people.
- There's nobody left around here now.
- We could have stopped them.
The mob stole the trucks and smashed
everything. They cut their own throats!
He's nuts...
Come on, jump in.
Hurry up. Jump in!
There was a girl with them.
If I could find her...
- She's kind of lost.
- You look kind of lost yourself.
- But I think I know where she'll be.
- It's your last chance to get out of here.
We humbly beseech
Thy divine guidance, O Lord.
Deliver us from the fear
which has come upon us.
From the evil that grows ever nearer.
From the terror that soon will knock
upon the very door of this, Thy house.
O Lord, we pray Thee.
Grant us the miracle
of Thy divine intervention.
Don't go, son. Stay with us.
No, I'm looking for someone.
She'll be in a church, near the door.
- Forrester!
- DuPrey, Bilderbeck! Are you?
- Where are the others?
- We don't know where they are.
I got knocked under our truck.
DuPrey pulled me out.
- What happened to Sylvia?
- We never did see her again.
In our peril we plead.
Succour and comfort us in this hour.
Please, God.
Sylvia!
Sylvia!
- Here! Here!
- Sylvia!
Let me through! Please!
It's quiet. Maybe they've gone away.
Something's happening to them.
It's dead.
We were all praying for a miracle.
