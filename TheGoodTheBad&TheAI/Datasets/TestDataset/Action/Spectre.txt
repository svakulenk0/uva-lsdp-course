Where are you going?
I won't be long.
Bottoms up.

I want to feel love
run through my blood
Tell me is this where
I give it all up?
I want to feel love
run through my blood
Tell me is this where
I give it all up?
I want to feel love
run through my blood
Tell me is this where
I give it all up?
Start anywhere you like.
Take your time, 007, but in five minutes
the head of the Joint Security Service
is going to walk through that door,
and I've got to explain to him
how one of our agents decided to
potter off to Mexico, all on his own,
and cause an international incident.
With all due respect, sir,
it could've been worse.
Worse? You blew up half a bloody block.
Well, better half a block than
a whole stadium full of people.
You had no authority.
None.
As you know, we're in the
middle of the biggest shakeup
in the history of British intelligence.
The ink's barely dry
on this merger with MI5
and already they're itching
for a chance to scrap
the double-0 program forever.
And you've just given them one.
You're right, sir.
You have got a tricky day ahead.
This is an official question.
Mexico City. What were you doing there?
It was just a coincidence. I
was taking some overdue holiday.
Okay. Fine.
As of this morning, you
are officially grounded.
I'm standing you down from
all operations indefinitely.
Very good, sir.
Sir?
I don't know what you're playing at,
but whatever it is, it has to stop.
Now.
- So sorry. Am I interrupting?
- Not remotely.
head of the Joint Security Service.
It's a pleasure to finally meet
you, 007. I've heard a lot about you.
Most of it good.
Congratulations on your new appointment.
Thank you.
I suppose we should call you C now.
No, no. "Max," please.
No, I think I'll call you C,
C.
As you wish.
Well, my door is always
open, 007, for my employees.
This merger's gonna be a
whole new chapter for us.
We're going to bring British
intelligence out of the Dark Ages
into the light.
That all sounds lovely.
That'll be all, 007. Report to Q
tomorrow for medical, thank you.
Very good, sir.
James?
Moneypenny.
So? How was the meeting?
Very good, thank you.
Here.
- Forensics finally released this.
- What is it?
It's personal effects they
recovered from Skyfall.
Perfect. You can bring it to me later.
- What do you mean?
- My place, 9:00.
Evening.
Come in.
Have you just moved in?
No.
Well, I like what you've
done with the place.
Your delivery.
Thank you.
Would you like a drink?
No, thanks. I'm not staying.
That's a shame.
What's going on, James?
There's not one person at MI6
who isn't talking about it.
Talking about what, exactly?
That what you did in
Mexico was one step too far.
That you're finished.
And what do you think?
I think you're just getting started.
I don't know what you mean.
All right.
I think you've got a secret.
And it's something you won't tell anyone.
Because you don't trust anyone.
If anything happens to me, 007,
I need you to do something.
Jesus.
Where did you get it?
In my mailbox just after she died.
Well, she was never short of surprises.
She wasn't gonna let death
get in the way of her job.
I've been tracking Sciarra ever since.
And what have you found?
Nothing significant yet.
When's the funeral?
Three days. In Rome.
If you think M's signing
off on that, you're insane.
He won't let you out of his sight.
Yes, it's a bit of a problem.
Listen.
Could you do a little quiet digging for me?
I heard a name in Mexico. "The Pale King."
You want me to be your mole.
Yes.
And what makes you think you can trust me?
Instinct.
TANNER: Poor old girl. Rigged
for demolition in a week.
Cheaper to knock her down than to rebuild.
Still.
Time waits for no man and all that.
Anyway, all the money's been spent on this,
the New Centre for National Security.
BOND: So that's C's new digs.
You've met him, have you?
Yesterday. What do we know about him?
Classic Whitehall mandarin.
Wrote a dossier last year
on how the double-0 program was obsolete,
how drones could do all
our dirty work abroad.
Went to school with the Home Secretary.
Of course, he did.
This merger's just the start of it.
In three days, there's a
security conference in Tokyo
to decide the New World Order.
If C gets his way, he'll
have unlimited access
to the combined the intelligence
streams of nine countries.
Including us.
Quite.
Well, a lot's happened while you were away.
A train bombing in Hamburg and an
industrial explosion in Tunisia.
It's not great timing for us.
It's all rather playing into C's hands.
M, well, let's say he's
feeling the pressure.
Yeah, I've noticed.
Now, this way, 007.
Be careful. It's a trifle slippery.
Q wasn't exactly feeling
at home in Whitehall,
what with the new merger,
so he set up shop here, away
from prying eyes, as it were.
I hear he's got something
rather special planned for you.
I can hardly wait.
Ah, 007.
- Q.
- Q: Please excuse the mess.
Everything's a little bit up in the air,
what with the changes and all.
Couple of things to get through.
Shall we get started?
Just relax.
That's it. Lovely.
Now, you may feel a small...
Christ!
...prick.
What is it?
Q: Cutting-edge nanotechnology.
Smart Blood.
Microchips in your bloodstream.
Allows us to track your
movements in the field.
You see those readouts?
We can monitor your vital signs
from anywhere on the planet.
Well, that sounds marvelous.
Call it a post-Mexico insurance policy.
By direct order of M.
I completely understand.
Good.
Right. Well, I've just, um,
got one last thing for you
and you can be on your way.
Magnificent, isn't she?
Zero to 60 in three point two seconds.
Fully bulletproof. A few
little tricks up her sleeve.
It's a shame, really.
She was meant for you,
but she's been reassigned to 009.
But you can have this.
Does it do anything?
It tells the time.
Might help with your punctuality issues.
- M's idea?
- Precisely.
Oh, one word of warning.
The alarm is rather loud.
If you know what I mean.
I think I do.
Oh, yes. That old thing is
taking quite a bit of time.
Mind you, there wasn't
much left to work on.
Only a steering wheel.
I believe I said, "Bring it back in
one piece," not, "Bring back one piece."
Anyway, enjoy your downtime, 007.
- Q?
- Q: Yes?
Well, now you know exactly
where I am all of the time.
Will you do something for me?
What do you have in mind, exactly?
Make me disappear.
May I remind you that
I answer directly to M.
I also have a mortgage.
And two cats to feed.
Well, then I suggest you trust me,
for the sake of the cats.
Well, it's lovely to see you, 007. Lovely.
Um, now, I meant to tell you,
the Smart Blood program is obviously
still in its developmental phase.
So we may experience the odd drop in
coverage during the first 24 hours...
but after that it should work perfectly.
I'll send you a postcard.
Please, don't.
Morning.
- What's that?
- Oh, it's just something from an admirer.
It's not your birthday, is it?
No, sir.
That was last week.
Q: Morning.
DB10, sir. He's waiting upstairs.
Oh, good. Yes, fine.
Oh, shit.
BOND: I'm sorry for your loss.
You knew my husband?
All too briefly.
What do you do?
Life insurance.
A little late for that.
For your husband, yes.
But what about you?
Me?
I hear the life expectancy of
some widows can be very short.
How can you talk like this?
Can't you see I'm grieving?
No.
What a lovely view.
You're wasting your time.
There are 100 more that will come after me.
All you buy me is five minutes.
Excellent.
Time for a drink.
You killed him,
didn't you?
My husband.
He was an assassin.
Trust me, he won't take it personally.
You signed my death
warrant. I was respected.
Loyal to a man you hated.
He trusted my silence.
With him gone, I'm a dead woman.
I can trust nobody.
I know the feeling well.
Well, I can tell you
that I don't trust you.
Well, then you have impeccable instincts.
If you don't leave now, we'll die together.
I can think of worse ways to go.
Then you're obviously crazy, Mister...
Bond.
James Bond.
These people,
if you just knew what they could do.
The power they have.
Did your husband ever
mention "The Pale King?"
No.
The organization,
they hardly ever meet.
But because of what happened to my husband,
they meet tonight.
Why?
To choose a replacement.
Where?
The Palazzo Cardenza.
- Midnight.
- Sounds like fun.
I might drop by.
He was obsessed.
He spent more time with them than with me.
Then the man was a fool.
LUCIA: Leaving your number?
BOND: I've called an American
friend of mine. Felix.
He'll contact his embassy
and get you out of here.
You'll be safe.
Don't go, James.
If you go there,
you're crossing over to a
place where there is no mercy.
I have to go.
MAN: ...pharmacy sites has provided
an excellent new sales platform.
We have adapted many of them into
clearinghouses for unapproved drugs.
In addition to which,
the latest figures show
that we presently control
of all oncological drugs
across Sub-Saharan Africa.
But we face challenges from the WHO
in their campaign against our
counterfeit pharmaceuticals.
We have now identified the
key individuals to target.
We expect the same success as we had
against the Council on Human Trafficking.
-
-
BLOFELD: Don't let me interrupt you.
MAN: Thank you, Doctor.
Now, on to the matter at hand.
After the success of our
attacks in Hamburg and Tunisia,
the aborted attack in Mexico City
and the death of our valued
colleague, Marco Sciarra,
leaves one of his duties outstanding.
Guerra, The
Pale King must be terminated.
Will you make the journey to Altaussee?
Does anyone challenge
Guerra for this position?
Welcome.
State your credentials for
succeeding  Sciarra.
BLOFELD: It's funny.
All that excitement in Mexico
City rang a distant bell.
And now,
suddenly, this evening,
it makes perfect sense.
Welcome, James.
It's been a long time.
But, finally, here we are.
What took you so long?
Cuckoo.
Ciao, Mickey Mouse.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
No.
-
-
Moneypenny.
Bond?
Listen, Moneypenny. Hamburg, Tunisia,
Mexico City, they're all linked.
It's one organization
coordinating multiple attacks.
So, she was right.
- I ran that check.
- MAN: Who is it?
Oh, my boss had his credit card stolen.
It's nothing. Why don't
you go back to sleep.
Don't be long.
- Who was that?
- MONEYPENNY:
BOND:
It's just a friend.
At this time of night?
It's called life, James.
You should try it sometime.
MONEYPENNY: The Pale King. It looks like
you've had dealings with him before.
-
- Of course.
- Mr. White!
-
Last unconfirmed sighting, Altaussee
in Austria, four months ago.
Hold that thought.
-
-
- You still there?
- Yeah.
Run another name, will you?
Okay. Go.
A man called Franz Oberhauser. He's...
And check his files
before and after his death.
After his death? What
are you talking about?
Please, just do it.
Okay, Q, give me something.
That's more like it.
Here goes nothing.
Good evening.
C: Do not let them tell you
we need less surveillance.
I say again, the Nine Eyes
committee would have full access
to the combined intelligence
streams of all member states.
less likelihood of
a terrorist attack.
it's time for the security
services of the world to unite.
An unelected one.
Thank you.
We will now vote on the resolution.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please cast your vote.
The vote is eight to one in favor.
However, as you know,
we cannot proceed unless by unanimous vote.
The Nine Eyes motion
is therefore not passed.
Democracy.
CHAIRMAN: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
- This evening's session is adjourned.
-
Yes, sir.
Please, tell me 007 is in London.
Q:
Um, I'll just take a look now, sir.
Because if he isn't, you're in deep shit.
I have him, sir. He
appears to be in Chelsea.
Well, I want eyes on him
when I get back, understood?
I completely understand,
sir.
-
-
Do me a favor. Make it quick.
Upstairs, Mr. White.
I always knew death would
wear a familiar face,
but not yours.
To what do I owe this pleasure, Mr. Bond?
I was at a meeting recently
and your name came up.
I'm flattered London is
still talking about me.
It wasn't MI6.
It was Rome.
Your team, not mine.
Ah.
Last month, I found
thallium in my cell phone.
It's done its job. I have
a few weeks. Maybe less.
So, here we are, Mr. Bond,
two dead men enjoying the evening.
What did you do?
I disobeyed him.
I followed him as far as I could.
He changed.
Oh, I see.
You grew a conscience.
Our game is our game. But this?
Women, children...
Well, the thallium would suggest
that he doesn't like you very much anymore.
And clearly the feeling is mutual.
So why don't you tell
me how to find him again?
Oh, come on.
Tell me where he is.
He's everywhere.
Everywhere!
He's sitting at your desk,
he's kissing your lover, he's
eating supper with your family!
You're protecting someone.
Your wife.
She left long ago.
Your son?
Your daughter.
You won't find her.
She's clever.
She's smarter than me.
She knows how to hide.
I can protect her if
you tell me where he is.
I can keep her alive.
Yeah.
You have my word.
Your word?
The word of an assassin!
That's my word.
You save her,
she can lead you to
She knows
Try the Hoffler Klinik.
You're a kite dancing
in a hurricane, Mr. Bond.
So long.
M: I can't deny I'm impressed you
got H.M.G. to cough up for all this.
C: Good God, the government couldn't
afford this kind of facility.
No, it was benefactors mostly,
from the private sector.
When it goes online,
this building will be
the most sophisticated
data gathering system in history.
The world's digital ghost, available 24/7.
George Orwell's worst nightmare.
I'm glad you like it.
My commiserations on
losing the Nine Eyes vote.
Must have been a blow.
Not really. Only a matter of time
before the South Africans see the light.
And you know what they say,
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Day and a half maybe.
Look, Max, I know
surveillance is a fact of life.
It's how you use the
information that concerns me,
and who is using it.
This is what we need to
do to keep the people safe.
Double-0 program is prehistoric.
Come on, M. You can't really
tell me that one man in the field
can compete with all of this,
running around out there
with his license to kill.
Have you ever had to kill a man, Max?
Have you?
To pull that trigger, you have to be sure.
Yes, you investigate,
analyze, assess, target.
And then you have to look him in the eye.
And you make the call.
And all the drones, bugs,
cameras, transcripts,
all the surveillance in the world
can't tell you what to do next.
A license to kill
is also a license not to kill.
I didn't want to have to do this,
but it looks like you still
can't control your agents.
MONEYPENNY:
Looks like you've had dealings
with him before. Quantum.
BOND:
MONEYPENNY: Last unconfirmed
sighting, Altaussee in Austria.
BOND:
C: So maybe there's something to be said
for total surveillance after all.
You watch MI6 agents?
We watch everyone.
SWANN: Please, take a seat.
I'll be with you in just a moment.
Please excuse me, Mr. Bond.
My name is Dr. Madeleine Swann.
Our job today is to analyze your needs,
both psychological and physical.
Hmm, sounds pretty straightforward.
I hope you don't mind. The
view can be distracting.
I hadn't noticed.
I see you filled out most of the paperwork.
Just a few questions to complete
your evaluation, if I may.
Do you exercise?
When I have to.
Do you consider your employment
to be psychologically stressful?
Sometimes.
How much alcohol do you consume?
Too much.
Some broader questions.
As a child, would you say you
were close to your parents?
My parents died when I was young.
Really? How old?
Old enough to remember.
How, if I may ask?
It was a climbing accident.
So who brought you up?
Someone else.
Humor me.
How does one train at Oxford and
the Sorbonne become a consultant,
spend two years with
and end up here?
Forgive me, but anyone might think
you were hiding from something.
You're paying a lot of
money to be here, Mr. Bond.
Who's asking the questions, you or me?
Of course. Carry on.
I see you left this final question blank.
What is your occupation?
Well, that's not the sort of
thing that looks good on a form.
And why is that?
I kill people.
Small world?
Where is he?
Your father's dead.
Two days ago.
How do you know?
Because I was there.
Did you kill him?
I didn't have to.
He did it himself.
And you came all the
way just to tell me this?
That my father's dead?
I came to tell you that your life
is in danger and I need your help.
- Why?
- I made a deal with him to protect you.
You're lying.
Why would he trust you?
Because he knew that I
needed something in return.
And what was that?
To find
This interview is over.
Dr. Swann...
You have 10 minutes to leave the
building. Then I'm calling security.
Thank you, Dr. Swann.
Can I get you something, sir?
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.
I'm sorry, we don't serve alcohol.
I'm really starting to love this place.
He'll have the prolytic
digestive enzyme shake.
Certainly.
If you've come for the car,
I parked it at the bottom of the Tiber.
Well, not to worry, 007. It was
only a £3,000,000 prototype.
Why are you here, Q?
Oh, I just fancied a break, to be honest.
I've been a tad stressed at work recently.
What with C's people crawling all over us
and the fact that M wants my
balls for Christmas decorations.
- Get to the point.
- The point, 007,
is that Franz Oberhauser is dead.
Dead and buried.
And unless you come back with me right now,
my career and Moneypenny's
will go the same way.
Do you understand? All hell is
breaking loose out there and...
- I saw him.
- You thought you saw him.
We've been through the records.
He died in an avalanche
with his father 20 years ago.
Yes. I know that.
But I saw him.
He's not someone I'll ever forget.
So you have a lead?
I have a name.
Well, that narrows it down.
Look, I'm sorry, 007, but time's up.
My whole career is on the line here.
Either you come back in and do
this through proper channels,
or I go directly to M.
Do one more thing for me. Then you're out.
Find out what you can from this.
I really, really hate you right now.
Thank you, Q.
Now? Please?
Where are you staying?
The Pevsner. Room 12.
One hour.
Here you are, sir. One
prolytic digestive enzyme shake.
Do me a favor, will you?
Throw that down the toilet.
Cut out the middleman.
-
-
No! Stay.
What do you want?
What are you doing?
Can't any of you speak?
Come on!
Right, come on. Come on.
Argh, don't touch me!
Hey!
You need to take a breath and
calm down. You're in shock.
Get away from me! Just get away!
Did it cross your mind
that you led them to me?
I haven't got time for this.
You need to tell me everything
you know about
Go to hell!
I gave your father my word!
And why should I trust
you? Because my father did?
Because right now, Dr. Swann,
I'm your best chance of staying alive.
Dr. Swann, Q.
Q, Dr. Swann.
- Hello.
- Enchanted.
Bond, we need to talk. Alone.
She knows.
- But, Bond...
- She knows.
What have you got?
I owe you an apology, 007.
You are onto something.
Oberhauser is still
alive. The ring proves it.
And it seems they were all
part of one organization.
Le Chiffre, Quantum, Sciarra,
your friend Mr. Silva.
And do you know who links them all?
BOND: Him.
Exactly.
This organization, do
you know what it's called?
- No.
- SWANN: Spectre.
Its name is Spectre.
How does she know that?
Because my father was part of it.
Then I think that you ought to see this.
REPORTER: You're looking at
pictures from South Africa right now
of what appears to
be a huge explosion.
Q, go back to London.
M's gonna need your help.
And keep tracking me.
Q: I will.
And, Bond, you have to
find
He's our only link to Oberhauser.
It's not a person.
It's a place.
Thank you.
This is where they spent
their wedding night.
They came back every year.
Then they brought me with them, too.
He kept coming back,
even after the divorce.
Well, then I'm sorry.
What for?
Ah-ha!
SWANN: What is it?
It's your inheritance.
- Want some?
- No, thank you.
You don't know what you're missing.
This can't be it.
Well, here's to your father.
I promised myself I would
never be hurt by that man again.
I cut off all contact.
I didn't want anything to
do with him or his sick life.
And then, with his dying breath
he sends me you.
Ironic, no?
You shouldn't be so hard on him.
The man I just met should
have been dead weeks ago.
The only reason his heart
was still beating was you.
I'll mourn my father in
my own time, Mr. Bond.
And, now, I'm going to bed.
-
- BOTH: Oh.
Don't think for one moment this
is where I fall into your arms,
seeking solace for my dead daddy.
You sit there.
Keep watch. That's what you're good at.
Come anywhere near me and I'll kill you.
I don't doubt it.
Look. There are two of you.
Two Jameses.
Lucky me.
Who sent you?
Who are you working for?
Now, where did you go?
Of course.
What is it?
Nothing.
What's this?
It's coordinates.
Your father was scanning for
a particular satellite phone.
He was looking for someone.
He was looking for him.
And he sent me here to finish the job.
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.
I like you alive.
I can look after myself.
That's beside the point.
I might not be coming back.
I know.
But I want to understand
what happened to my father.
So, where was he going?
Nowhere.
Thank you so much.
Thanks. All the very best.
What's going on?
The meeting was brought forward.
Did you not get the message?
No, we didn't.
Shortest meeting I can remember.
South Africans on board, I take it?
Yeah, well, who can blame them?
Nine Eyes is now officially sanctioned.
The new system goes live
in less than 72 hours.
It's a major step forward.
Global intelligence
cooperation changes everything.
As you said before.
Look.
They've asked me to head the new committee.
Yes? And?
And I should tell you I've
spoken with the Home Secretary.
And in light of the new
information I've given him,
he's decided to close down the
double-0 program with immediate effect.
You don't know what you're doing.
It's not personal.
It's the future.
And...
You're not.
You're a cocky little bastard, aren't you?
I'll take that as a compliment.
I wouldn't.
This isn't over yet.
- Would you press this for me? Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
Pick it up.
I hate guns.
I promised him I'd protect you.
The first thing to do is to
teach you how to protect yourself.
What if I shoot you by mistake?
Wouldn't be the first time.
Pick it up.
I said, I hate guns.
SIG 226.
Front sight. Rear sight. Hammer.
You just point it. You squeeze the trigger.
You try not to close your eyes.
Please, try it.
I don't have to teach you anything, do I?
A man once came to our
house to kill my father.
He didn't know I was upstairs
playing in my bedroom.
Or that Papa kept a
Beretta Nine-millimeter
under the sink with the bleach.
That's why I hate guns.
I think we'll skip
hand-to-hand combat.
MONEYPENNY: Good evening, sir.
Sorry to interrupt your
supper, but we have some news.
Q: Evening, sir.
Using the Smart Blood, I've tracked Bond
to a point here in North Africa.
See, every known map
registers it as empty desert.
Exactly. But if you look at the satellite
blowup, you can clearly see this.
We can't help him.
But, sir, we know where he's heading.
C is watching everything we do.
We're only handing them more information.
Sir, we can't just desert Bond.
We have to. We only make him weaker.
But, sir, we know exactly where he is.
Yes, I know, but if we can
track him, so can others.
Delete all the Smart Blood files.
Everything.
He's on his own.
You shouldn't stare.
Well, you shouldn't look like that.
May I get you an
I'm not sure.
It gets me into trouble.
Makes me do crazy things.
Well, we can't have that.
So, I'll have a vodka martini, dirty.
Make that two.
I have a question.
Well, what's that?
Why, given every other possible option,
does a man choose the
life of a paid assassin?
Well, it was that or the priesthood.
I'm serious. Is this really what you want?
Living in the shadows?
Hunting? Being hunted?
Always looking behind you? Always alone?
But I'm not alone.
Answer the question.
I'm not sure I ever had a choice.
Anyway, I don't stop to think about it.
What would happen if you did?
- Stop?
- Yes.
I don't know.
Your drinks, sir.
Could you leave them there, please.
You know, I think you're wrong.
I am?
We always have a choice.
I'll drink to that.
Shit.
What do we do now?
BOND: This might be a long wait.
Are you having second thoughts?
Too late now.
What's that?
That is a 1948 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith.
Please.
I'm scared, James.
Good afternoon, Mr. Bond, Dr. Swann.
I want you to know just how excited
we all are to finally meet you.
Well, it's a pleasure to be here.
Your host invites you both to rest,
relax, and join him for drinks at 4:00.
- Tell our host we won't be late.
- MAN: Wonderful.
Before we show you to your
rooms, just one more thing.
Oh.
You be careful with that.
It's loaded.
Thank you.
MAN: This is a very special place.
He has requested you enter it alone.
Of course.
Champagne?
Maybe later.
Certainly.
BOND:  I think
we're meant to be impressed.
BLOFELD: Touch it.
You can touch it if you want.
Do you know what it is?
It's a meteorite.
BLOFELD: Yes, exactly.
The Kartenhoff. The
oldest in human possession.
The very meteorite which made this crater.
Think about it.
So many years up there, alone, silent,
building momentum until it
chose to make its mark on Earth.
A huge, unstoppable force.
Except it did stop, didn't it?
Right here.
I can't tell you how much I've
been looking forward to this.
All of us here, together.
A reunion.
I'm so glad you came, too, dear Madeleine.
You were just a girl when I saw you first.
I came to your home
once to see your father.
I don't remember that.
But I do.
Shall we?
SWANN: What is this place?
Information.
Information is all,
is it not?
For example,
you must know by now that the
double-0 program is officially dead.
Which leads me to
speculate exactly why you came.
So, James, why did you come?
I came here to kill you.
And I thought you came here to die.
Well, it's all a matter of perspective.
Speaking of perspective.
- Is this live?
- MAN: Live and direct. 16:20 GMT.
BLOFELD: What an uncanny coincidence.
The French have a saying, "It's
the fate of glass to break."
Well, maybe it's the fate
of spies to just disappear.
In the meantime, I'm sure
C will keep you all busy.
That's touching, don't you think?
Well, James,
it looks like you're all alone.
Not much more than a voyeur, are you?
Too scared to join in.
I don't think
you quite understand.
Oh, I think I do.
You set cities on fire and
watch innocent people burn,
so you can convince governments to join
an intelligence network you've paid for.
Not that complicated.
I'm guessing our little friend,
C, he's one of your disciples.
You could say that.
And what does he get out of it?
Nothing.
He's a visionary, like me.
Visionaries.
Psychiatric wards are full of them.
Whereas you couldn't see
what's right in front of you.
You came across me so many
times and yet you never saw me.
Le Chiffre, Greene, Silva.
All dead.
Yeah, that's right.
A nice pattern developed.
You interfered in my
world, I destroyed yours.
Or did you think it was coincidence
that all the women in
your life ended up dead?
Vesper Lynd, for example.
She was the big one. Has
he told you about her?
And then, of course, your beloved M.
Gone forever.
Me.
It was all me, James.
It's always been me. The
author of all your pain.
You're a brave woman, my dear.
Now I understand why
my father lost his mind.
He didn't lose his mind, he was just weak.
But at least he understood
what he was up against.
You see, they failed to
comprehend the crucial fact,
that a terrible event can
lead to something wonderful.
Since you mention your
father, I'll show you.
WHITE:  She's
clever. She's smarter than me.
BOND: I can protect her if
you tell me where he is.
BOND:
WHITE:
BOND:
No, no, no. Turn this off.
WHITE:
Turn this off.
- This is important.
- I said turn it off!
I want you to understand something.
BOND:
Madeleine?
Look at me.
Don't look at him, Madeleine. Look at me.
WHITE:
she can lead you to L'Americain.
She knows L'Americain.
You're a kite dancing in
a hurricane, Mr. Bond.
The things that bring people together.
Out of horror, beauty.
BLOFELD: Torture is easy,
on a superficial level.
A man can watch himself being disemboweled
and derive great horror
from the experience,
but it's still going on at a distance.
It isn't taking place where he is.
As you know all too well, dear
Madeleine, a man lives inside his head.
That's where the seat of his soul is.
Now, James and I were both present recently
when a man was deprived of his eyes.
And the most astonishing thing happened.
Didn't you notice?
He wasn't there anymore.
He'd gone even though he was still alive.
So in this brief moment
between life and death,
there was nobody inside his skull.
Most odd.
So, James.
I'm going to penetrate
to where you are.
To the inside of your head.
Now, the first probe
will play with your sight,
your hearing
and your balance,
just with the subtlest of manipulations.
Well, get on with it then.
Nothing can be as painful
as listening to you talk.
All right.
Let's begin.
Why are you doing this?
You probably know that James here
lost his parents when he was young.
But did you know that it was my father
who helped him through this difficult time?
Over the course of two winters
he taught him to ski, and climb, and hunt.
He soothed the wounds of the
poor little blue-eyed orphan.
Asked me to treat him as a brother.
My little brother.
They formed quite an attachment.
So,
you killed him.
Yes, I did.
You know what happens when a cuckoo
hatches inside another bird's nest?
Yes.
It forces the other eggs out.
BLOFELD: Yes.
Well, this cuckoo made me realize
my father's life had to end.
In a way, he's responsible
for the path I took.
So, thank you.  Cuckoo.
Do you know any other birdcalls, Franz?
Hello, pussy.
Franz Oberhauser died 20 years ago, James.
In an avalanche, alongside his father.
The man you are talking to
now, the man inside your head,
is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
Catchy name.
My mother's bloodline.
If the needle finds the correct
spot in the fusiform gyrus,
you'll recognize no one.
Of course,
the faces of your women
are interchangeable, aren't they, James?
You won't know who she is.
Just another passing face
on your way to the grave.
He dies not knowing who you are.
The daughter of an assassin.
The only one who could have understood him.
- Shame.
-
-
-
I love you.
BLOFELD: Do those blue
eyes still recognize you?
I'd recognize you anywhere.
The watch.
One minute.
One minute.
BLOFELD: Did he say something?
- What?
-
I can't hear you, James.
BOND: I said,
doesn't time fly?
In there!
Let's go home.
It's not over yet.
Q: I've never even heard of Hildebrand.
M: That is the general
idea with safe houses.
Exactly how safe is this, sir?
We're about to find out.
It's safe.
Better wait here.
I'm M.
Madeleine Swann.
Pleased to meet you.
So, what do you have for me, 007?
The recently deceased head of
Spectre, Ernst Stavro Blofeld,
and his chief of intelligence,
your new best friend, C.
About to take control of his very
own global surveillance system
that he built right here under our noses.
Then we'd better move. The
system goes online at midnight.
BOND: If that happens, Spectre
will have control of everything.
So, you and I will have a quiet word with C
while Q hacks into the system
and stops it going online.
It won't be easy.
He'll find a way. He always does.
It's good to have you back, 007.
Sir.
James, I can't.
I'll come back for you when it's all over.
No, I can't.
No, you can't stay here, or you...
I can't go back to this life. And
I'm not going to ask you to change.
This is who you are.
You're saying good-bye.
Yes.
Take care.
You're a good man, James.
Are you in yet, Q?
A few layers of impenetrable
security still to go,
They've seen us! Reverse!
Go!
Get him in the building!
Move. Move!
Go back and find M, now! We need them both.
Not a good feeling being watched, is it?
Don't tell me you're responsible for this.
No, but my Quartermaster is.
And he's extremely talented.
C: Well, bravo.
But in case you hadn't realized
it, you two are out of a job.
So you're trespassing.
I'm afraid you've got the
wrong end of the stick, Max.
We're going to stop
this system going online.
And then I'm going to bring you in.
On what grounds exactly?
Poor taste in friends.
Take a look at the world.
Chaos.
Because people like you,
paper-pushers and politicians,
are too spineless to do
what needs to be done.
So I made an alliance to put
the power where it should be.
And now you want to throw it
away for the sake of "democracy."
Whatever the hell that is.
How predictably moronic.
But then isn't that what M stands for?
- "Moron."
-
And now we know what C stands for.
"Careless."
Come on.
-
- No, no, no!
You're a hard man to kill, Blofeld.
Ouch.
I do hope that doesn't hurt too much.
My wounds will heal.
What about yours?
Look around you, James. Look.
This is what's left of your world.
Everything you ever stood for,
everything you believed in, a ruin.
Why are we here?
Did you miss me?
No.
But I know someone who does.
Where is she?
That's for you to find out.
In three minutes, this
building will be demolished.
I can get out easily.
Now, you have a choice.
Die trying to save her or
save yourself and live with the pain.
You're bluffing.
Am I?
I've really put
you through it, haven't I?
That's brothers for you.
They always know which buttons to press.
Madeleine!
- Come on.
-
Come on.
Yes!
Let's go.
After you.
Why can't you just face it, M?
You don't matter anymore.
Maybe I don't.
But something has to.
Dead.
- Any word on Bond?
- MONEYPENNY: No.
But I can hazard a guess.
Madeleine!
Madeleine!
Do you trust me?
Do I have a choice?
Not anymore.
Come on!
Good-bye, James Bond.
Brace, brace, brace!
Sir, this is a terrorist alert.
Mallory, double-0 section.
Stand them down.
Echo team, hold fire.
Stand down.
Finish it.
Finish it.
Out of bullets.
And besides,
I've got something better to do.
Under the Special Measures Act of 2001,
I am detaining you on behalf
of Her Majesty's Government.
Bond?
- What are you doing here?
- Good morning, Q.
I thought you'd gone.
I have.
There's just one thing I need.
