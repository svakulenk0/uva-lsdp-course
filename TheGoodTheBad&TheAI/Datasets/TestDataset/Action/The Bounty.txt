This way.
Court is assembled
by the Right Honorable Lords,
Commissioners of the Admiralty
and I quote: To enquire into the cause
and circumstances of the seizure
of His Majesty's armed vessel,
The Bounty,
commanded by
Lieutenant William Bligh
and to try the said
Lieutenant William Bligh
for his conduct
on that occasion.
Surrender your sword
and be seated.
Lieutenant Bligh.
Perhaps it would be useful if you
told the court in your own words
the events
of April 28th last year.
Yes sir. If it please my Lords,
I will first read a list of the mutineers
who seized my ship.
The crew is not on trial here,
Mr Bligh. You, sir, are on trial.
The question at issue is
how you came to lose your ship.
To understand that, Captain Greetham,
it is essential to know
who were the mutineers
aboard that ship.
Alleged mutineers.
Continue Mr Bligh.
Fletcher Christian,
Masters Mate.
Wasn't this Christian
a friend of yours?
He was, sir.
Fifty guineas says he's dead.
Sixty says he's alive.
I'll wager he's still alive.
How much?
We'll dine within the hour.
- How much?
- Sixty guineas.
Taken.
I'll be back to collect it.
Graham!
Fletcher!
What are you all doing?
One of our members collapsed.
We're betting
on whether or not he's dead.
What brings you
to this den of iniquity?
Is there somewhere we can talk?
It's a breadfruit.
Breadfruit.
The Admiralty has instructed me to take
breadfruit plants from Tahiti to Jamaica.
Tahiti?
Fletcher, I want you
to sail with me again.
In what capacity?
The Admiralty's already assigned a
Mr John Fryer as Master of the ship.
He's a good man I think.
But I want you to be Master's Mate.
- If you agree, that is.
- Agreed.
Good, splendid! Good.
Why take breadfruit to Jamaica?
Cheap fodder for the slaves
on the plantations there.
Bananas are very expensive
there these days.
It lacks glory, William.
Well I don't have your connections,
you see Fletcher.
I want to make a name for myself,
before I'm too old.
And this green grocery trip
will make your name?
Now look, we'll go around
Cape Horn to Tahiti.
We'll pick up the breadfruit
then continue on
through the Endeavour Straits around
the Cape of Good Hope to Jamaica.
And then back to England.
We'll circumnavigate the globe.
Yes, but why risk
going round the Horn?
Because it is
the quicker route, Mr Fryer.
Quicker if we strike the one week
in a hundred
when there isn't a storm raging.
Oh. So you would have us go the long
way? Around Africa and Australia.
There and back.
Avoid the Horn altogether.
What conditions
do the plants need?
Warmth, light and water.
I shall be giving up my cabin to them.
We shall be like little pigs
in a stye. Shan't we?
No sir, we shall not.
I run a healthy ship, Mr Fryer.
I only say
the Bounty's too small.
We should have a frigate,
not a chamber pot.
Yes, and I should
have promotion to Captain.
But the Navy Board would
not heed either request. See?
Quickly now, children.
Ah, my little ones.
They've come to say goodnight.
Oh, goodnight,
goodnight. Off you go...
Aren't you going to say goodnight to Mr
Christian, Mr Fryer? Don't I get a kiss?
Goodnight, young ladies.
Goodnight, goodnight.
William a toast.
To circumnavigation.
To circumnavigation.
Circumnavigation.
And your safe and speedy return.
Yes.
We set sail two days before Christmas,
Stand by to set the mainsail.
What are you staring at me for? Aloft!
Loose that mizzen topsail, lively.
Remove some of these gussets!
Back down in the rigging!
Stand by, you crew gunners!
Away, you crew gunners.
Southwest by south.
That's your course.
Southwest by south. Aye aye sir.
Right men! Food up! Come on.
What's the name
of the cook? Lamb?! Hey, Lamb!
I hope
you got some lamb in that stew.
Hey, is it true
what they say about Tahiti?
You mean the women.
Do they really go around
with no clothes on?
All they wear is tattoos.
In wonderful places.
True?
Cross my heart. Paradise.
Hey!
You're in my place, Quintel.
Move yourself.
Don't look at him.
There'll be trouble.
I said you're in my seat.
- Piss off.
- Bugger off.
- What did you say?
- Shut it, Churchill.
You keep out of this.
Look out, he's got a knife.
Keep it quiet, Churchill.
Keep it down, lads.
Churchill!
The King.
The King. God bless him.
To the ship. May she swim well.
The ship.
The men are very quiet.
Charming tune.
And a fine musician.
We're lucky to have him.
Yes. He is not there
by chance, Mr Nelson.
Having him there
is good for morale.
Dr. Huggen. Another glass?
No thank you, sir.
You're uncommonly
abstemious tonight.
Well, more men have died
at sea from drink,
disease and dirt than
ever died by drowning.
Depend upon it, gentlemen.
I'm determined the Bounty
shall not lose a single man.
By heavens! I'll drink to that.
Then came
to one soft push.
Then came
the sweetest flower to find.
- Striking a superior officer.
- No I didn't.
- It's a hanging offence, sir.
- Sorry sir.
Can't be helped. We shall all get
to know each other pretty closely.
I wonder what we shall find out.
It depends how inquisitive
we are, Mr Young.
It doesn't sound quite right to me.
Do you think someone
had better go and look?
There is a ship and
it sailed to sea. It's loaded deep. -
Good evening, Mr Heywood.
Good evening, Adams.
Evening, Mr Adams, sir.
Everything alright here?
Couldn't be better, sir.
My place.
Stupid buggers.
You watch
your mouth too, old man.
Don't old man me, Churchill.
You haven't got a lucky face.
Seasick, Mr Heywood, sir?
Just leaving England.
Oh. Home sick.
- Feels you'll never see it again.
- Don't say that, sir. It's bad luck.
Sorry. Never been to sea before.
Two months ago I was still at school.
Never been to school meself.
Oh.
Can't even read.
I can't steer a ship.
Any fool can steer a ship, sir.
It's just knowing where to take it.
The end of our first day at sea.
Tot of rum, sir?
No, thank you, no.
Come on, sir. We don't cross
the Equator every day.
No. Thank you. No. Make sure
Mr Heywood has some, though.
OK. That'll do.
Haul him in. Away.
Coming up for sup,
Mr Heywood. Sir
Here you go sir. Have some of that.
Have some of that, sir.
Revive the spirit as they say.
Have a sup of that. Go on.
Get some
of this muck down you.
Well done, sir.
Thank you, Quintel.
Lieutenant Bligh,
I have your log here before me.
In it, there is the frequent entry
of a single word: dancing.
Can you explain that?
I can, sir.
A crew on a long voyage may easily
fall into melancholy and violence.
I believe this can be relieved
by regular exercise.
So for 20 minutes each day, I had the
crew mustered and I had them dance.
- Dance?
- Yes. They danced.
An activity
they participated in wholeheartedly?
I think so. Yes.
And yet Mr Bligh,
in your own log,
you admit that this rather
unorthodox form of exercise
led to grave discontent.
On one occasion only,
sir. And not grave.
Charlie. If you only had a frock on,
I'd ask you for a dance.
Get your knees up, Quintel.
I'm doing my best, sir.
Don't answer back.
We're bloody sailors,
not bloody dancers.
Mr Christian. Mr Young.
Put a gag on Quintel.
It wasn't bloody me.
Don't make it worse, Quintel.
It wasn't him, sir. It was me.
Come along, Mr Christian.
You've got the wrong man, sir.
Churchill said it was he
who made the remark.
Gag them both.
Ah, Jesus Christ.
- Do as he says, Mr Christian.
- Sir!
Fletcher.
William, don't you think those men
have been gagged there long enough?
They were both guilty
of an act of insubordination.
I could have passed it off with
a laugh and have done less harm.
The Royal Navy is not
a humorous institution, sir.
And insubordination
is no laughing matter.
However, you may cut them loose,
Mr Christian.
But mind they appreciate
the gravity of their offence.
Thank you, sir.
Captain's orders.
Ah, yes. Sure.
You can close your mouth.
Or I'll put it back in.
I hadn't expected this from the Horn. Do
you think the weather will stay with us?
Perhaps.
It doesn't look much. Does it?
No, it doesn't, sir. But I've seen
the Horn when the waves
were as high as three houses
one on top of the other.
I once saw six men washed
overboard on one wave.
Someone on this ship
is very lucky.
Mr Fryer! Close reef!
Close reef, sir?
Don't argue with me. Close reef.
Close reef, Mr Cole.
Stand by to close reef! All hands
on deck! Move yourselves!
Hurry along and take those sails in!
Get further aloft!
Hurry up, move yourselves!
Get those sails in!
Doesn't seem to like
fair weather, does he?
Haul on that sheet!
Get those sails in!
Mr Fryer. I seem to have
made a misjudgement.
You don't make many, sir.
Make sail.
Make sail, Mr Cole.
Aye, Aye, sir. Prepare to make sail!
Let go sheets and tack!
Square away!
Get aloft!
Someone!
Mr Christian!
Pull! Pull!
Robert, mind those bloody pots! Robert,
he's on fire! Someone douse him.
We'll all be killed!
All hands on deck!
Close the hatches!
Take the wheel, man.
Steering to port side.
Man those pumps!
Jamie,
hold that board. Someone!
Don't let go on the pumps!
Somebody get a bloody hammer.
Sir! Sir!
Have the carpenter lash
those things down, now!
- We must turn back!
- What?
In my opinion,
we should put about.
In my opinion we should not, sir.
We keep on our course.
You'll never make it
round the Horn. We must turn back.
Mr Cole, Mr Cole!
I want my opinion in the log, sir.
Mr Cole, have that lashed down.
And all the men on deck, now!
I want my opinion in the log!
Very well, Mr Fryer. If that's what
you wish, you shall have it.
The ship can't stand it
The ship can stand it
very well, Mr Fryer!
And how long do you think
the men can stand it?
As long as the officers
can stand it, Mr Fryer!
Get these things
tied down now.
Valentine! Come with me, boy!
Mr Bligh. How long did you
attempt to round the Horn?
And how far
did you travel in that time?
in 31 days, Mr Bligh.
You endangered your ship
and your crew for 31 days
in order to satisfy your ambition
to circumnavigate the globe.
My dearest Betsy,
Only to you in this bitter moment
can I reveal my heart.
I have failed completely
in my attempt to round Cape Horn
and circumnavigate the globe.
My doubts about Mr Fryer's
commitment to our endeavour
have been confirmed.
Enter.
- The men are assembled, sir.
- Come in. Come in.
I'm very sorry, William.
Oh. It can't be helped.
Come along.
Lads!
We will go about and run downwind
for Africa and the Indian Ocean.
- Mr Lamb!
- Here Sir.
As soon as we have put about it will be
safe to light your galley fires again.
Tonight I want as much hot mush
as every man can eat.
Let's hear it
for the Captain, lads! Hip-hip!
Hooray! Hooray!
However. However. We're still
faced with a long hard voyage.
I mean to make good use
of every hour of sailing time.
And to assist me in this, I'm replacing
Mr Fryer with Mr Christian
who will now act
as executive second in command
with the rank of
Acting Second Lieutenant.
Mr Fryer, come back here.
Mr Fryer, sir! Come back here!
You'll dismiss when I have done
with you, sir. Do you hear me?
- This is an outrage!
- Mr Fryer.
In all my years at sea...
Your years at sea?
Good Lord, man.
If I had known your nature,
I would not have accepted you
as boson of a river barge.
Must I suffer this before...
You'll suffer my correction,
whenever you're at fault, sir!
What fault?
Damn your eyes, man!
You turned your back on me!
- Oh, for that I apologize.
- Very well.
- But I protest.
- You protest, do you?
I am Master of The Bounty.
And I am Commander, by law!
I am the first. Do you understand?
God damn your hide.
And now you may dismiss, sir!
- Mr Cole.
- Sir.
All hands on deck. If you please.
Surely, Mr Bligh. It was unwise
to replace a professional sailor
like Mr Fryer
with a relative novice?
Fletcher Christian could hardly
be called a novice, sir.
The fact that he was
a good friend of yours,
was not of undue
influence upon you?
Let me know the intent
of your question, Mr Greetham.
We're trying to establish, Mr Bligh,
how you came to lose your ship.
I did not lose my ship, sir!
It was taken from me by a gang of
mutineers led by Fletcher Christian.
The man you promoted.
Yes. I promoted him because
John Fryer was grossly inefficient.
And he was also a coward. Fletcher
Christian at least had courage.
More, perhaps, than you ultimately
found to be acceptable. Eh, Mr Bligh?
Friday, October 10th.
At half-past twelve today,
James Valentine departed this life
as a result of illness and fatigue
sustained at Cape Horn.
This after all my care of the men
is surely a result
of our drunken surgeon's neglect.
Oh, God. By whose mercy
the souls of all men rest.
Bless these waters
and absolve from sin
he whose body
we now confine to them.
Eternal rest grant unto him.
And may he rest in peace. Amen.
Amen.
Commit the body to the deep.
At four o'clock, we buried Valentine
with all the decency in our power.
Twenty-five degrees.
Thirty-six minutes.
Land Ho! Land Ho!
Where away?
Dead ahead, sir.
Stand by to fire the salute!
Ready to fire the salute. Fire!
Stand by for a second salute!
Fire second salute!
Hey. I'll have her.
Thank you.
Quintel!
Sorry sir.
Have you ever seen
a woman before?
Keep your mind
and your eyes on your work, man.
Come on, get in line there.
Oars!
Prepare to toss oars.
Toss oars.
Toss your oars.
Thank you.
Hail, Capitan Bligh.
Hail, King Tynah.
Thank you, your Majesty.
I bring you greetings from His Majesty,
King George of England.
How is the great Captain Cook?
Captain Cook! He's well
and he also sends his greetings.
- He lives?
- Yes.
- He is my friend.
- I know.
Now you see.
Ah!
He gave me his picture.
Yes.
Some people say he was killed
by the people of Hawaii.
No, er... Captain Cook
is very much alive.
And, er, he's in good health,
King Tynah. He's very much alive.
As I said,
he sends his greetings to you.
And, er, he always talks of you
as his very close friend.
You told that
to this man... Tynah?
King Tynah, sir.
A savage King.
A King, my lord.
Descended from many Kings.
As our King George
is descended from many Kings.
Yes, in a way, sir.
Then why did you lie to him?
Why did you not tell him
Captain Cook was murdered
in Hawaii 10 years before?
Because they believe
that Captain Cook is immortal.
Literally?
They seem to regard
his likeness as a sacred image.
Interesting.
They also believe that every British
officer is more or less related to him.
So you were
more or less immortal too.
It would appear so, sir. And-um -
I also needed their assistance.
Captain Cook was our guarantor.
How long you stay in Tahiti?
About two months.
Round about the islands.
Stay here. Do not go to the other
islands. No welcome there for you.
Everything you need is here.
I'm much obliged to you.
His Majesty King George
has sent you many gifts,
King Tynah. Perhaps
I could carry back in return.
Gifts from yourself
to His Majesty King George.
Anything for a King. Pigs.
Bananas. Coconuts. Breadfruit.
Breadfruit. Breadfruit's
a very good idea. Yes, breadfruit.
I think His Majesty likes breadfruit.
Isn't that true Mr Nelson?
Indeed it is, sir.
His Majesty is a very keen gardener.
He would appreciate
breadfruit greatly.
If you were to send him
little breadfruit plants.
He could grow them
in his own garden.
We shall grow him
many little plants.
Thank you.
- Mr Christian.
- Sir.
Mr Cole. Would you distribute the gifts
to King Tynah and his good people.
These are gifts from His Majesty King
George of England to yourselves.
Sir.
Take it away, Mr Cole.
Oh, dear God.
- I hoped to avoid this.
- Avoid what, sir?
Dammit all man,
I'm expected to sleep with her.
She's one of King Tynah's wives. A gift
from one chief to another as it were.
Now look,
five minutes after I go below,
you must call me up on some
important business. Alright?
Yes sir. What business?
Business, dammit.
Any bloody business.
Welcome aboard, Ma'am.
Yes. Get on with your work.
She should soften
the old man up a bit.
Hot.
Enter.
Excuse me, sir. I...
- Mr Christian.
- Sir.
What demands
my immediate attention?
It could wait until tomorrow.
What is it? Damn you.
The ship is sinking, sir.
Good.
Ma'am.
Was Fletcher Christian
at this time still your friend and ally?
At that time, yes.
There was no indication
of any resentment towards you?
No. None.
Mr Bligh. When you planted
out your breadfruit,
did not the savages carry out
some sort of ceremony?
An indecent ceremony?
Is this relevant, Captain Greetham?
My Lord, if the crew
were allowed to witness it, yes.
Were the crew present, Mr Bligh?
Yes.
And was it indecent?
It is their deep belief
that the earth is rendered fruitful
by the coupling of their Gods.
And that the Gods can be roused
by the coupling of men and women.
So it did begin at the ceremony?
No sir. Not at the ceremony.
No, it was Fletcher Christian
and the native girl.
You misunderstood the depth
of the emotion between them?
Yes. I realise that now.
I had assumed that it was
simply youthful passion.
It takes more than an infatuated
youth to make a mutiny.
It takes a discontented crew.
The crew were anything
but discontented, sir.
Fletcher Christian corrupted them.
Yes, but what made them
so easy to corrupt?
I don't know.
It was the place itself.
Come here.
Mr, Christian.
Come in, whoever you are.
Faya!
Captain Bligh's surprised
that he hasn't had the pleasure of your
company at supper for some weeks.
Do you still do that?
And the Captain says
he'll expect you this evening.
Today. Today's not Friday.
Six o'clock.
Prompt, if you please.
Areya.
Wait, Dr Huggen.
I found the most extraordinary plant
today. On the west side of the island.
Just by the mouth of the river.
Mr Christian, it is half past seven.
Well, you didn't wait for me. I hope.
May I ask why you have come
to my table in a state of undress?
Well, I couldn't wear the jacket.
The tattoo's too painful.
Good God.
Put on your jacket, Mr Christian.
It's very painful, sir.
Put on your jacket,
Mr Christian. If you please.
- May I serve now?
- Wait!
Thank you, Mr Christian.
Very well Smith,
you may serve now.
Thank you sir.
- Mr Nelson.
- Sir.
When did you last inspect
the breadfruit plants?
Yesterday, sir.
Not today?
No sir. Mr Christian said a daily
inspection was not necessary.
Oh, did he indeed?
Well, Mr Christian.
And when do you think they will be
ready to transport in your opinion?
They'll be some time yet, sir.
We've already been here thirteen
weeks longer than we intended.
Will we never leave this place?
Because we arrived
so late. The plants...
I want to be advised of their progress
every day, Mr Christian.
Unless you need the time to cover
the rest of your body in pretty pictures.
Wait!
The sooner
we are seamen again the better.
Don't you agree, gentlemen?
Now perhaps you will join me in prayer.
Oh Lord, our heavenly father.
Almighty and everlasting God.
Most humbly do we thank thee
for what we're about to receive.
It won't be long now lads.
You'll all be on your way home.
You're not coming?
I fancy having a look at a few
of the other islands around here.
They'll hang you for desertion.
Only if we're caught.
You with us, John?
No. I've got a wife
and three kids back home.
There he goes.
Mr Bligh and bloody mighty.
How do you fancy the Endeavour
Straits? The Indian Ocean?
The South Atlantic?
The North Atlantic?
Nothing
but rotten biscuits and pork.
And his bloody lordship on your back
morning, noon and night.
Not me lads. Not me.
When do we go then?
Who's officer of the watch tonight?
I am.
Yeah?
Yes.
Well that's it, then.
Hey, Fletcher Christian.
Harami.
Maieva.
Harahai.
Thank you.
You wanted to see me, sir?
My daughter...
She has something of yours.
Of mine?
You are here now. Tamari.
Well, I'm sorry, sir, I...
Take this tusk.
When you see it, you'll remember
my daughter and my grandchild.
You will never forget Tahiti.
Fletcher Christian. Your wife.
- Think we should go as well?
- No, I do not.
Mr Heywood's going to have
to answer for this, you know.
Poor Heywood.
Hey, you bloody fools.
The Hottentots out there aren't as
friendly as these ones, you know.
Yeah. Come on lads.
Good luck to them
that's what I say.
They'll need it.
All hands.
Thank you, Mr Fryer.
Last night. Three men of
Mr Heywood's watch deserted ship.
The penalty for which
is death by hanging.
Mr Heywood, how is it you did not
see them? Were you asleep?
Yes sir.
Very well. You shall kiss
the gunner's daughter.
- Bosun.
- Sir.
Put this man over the cannon.
Do it now!
Aye, aye, sir.
Now listen to me, all of you.
In one week's time...
Hiya!
Stop that laughing!
Silence! You think this is funny?
You're a pitiful sight,
Dr. Huggen.
Go below to your quarters...
You think
this is a humorous occasion.
You are mistaken. From now on there's
going to be discipline on this ship.
We're going to have order.
And we're going to be like seamen.
In one week's time we will put to sea.
There will be no more grog.
There will be no more shore leave.
You've become a rabble, all of you.
And you will clean up
this ship and yourselves.
- Bosun.
- Sir!
Administer the punishment now.
Capitan Bligh.
Mr Christian! Mr Christian, sir.
Sir!
I wish to talk to you outside. Now!
Coming sir.
Thank you.
Is there anything wrong, sir?
Yes. Last night while the mate
of the watch was asleep, three...
Stop that noise!
Fiya!
Three men jumped ship last night.
Churchill was one of them.
You don't seem surprised?
Now that it's happened, no.
No, I'm not surprised.
I must say
I'm no longer surprised myself
when I see the example being set
by my first officer.
Just look at yourself, man.
Look at the way you're dressed.
Come on. You're no better
than one of these natives.
At least I am no worse.
I think your brain
has been overheated, sir.
And your body overindulged
in sexual excess.
I have done no more than
any natural man would do.
No. You have done no more
than any wild animal would do.
It always makes me laugh,
but when men lose their self-restraint
they say they're natural.
They are more natural than men
who have nothing to restrain.
Mr Christian, you will report
to the ship before sundown.
Is that understood?
No. No.
What did you say? You said no. Is that
what you said? Is that what you said?
No. Alright. You will report to the ship
immediately. Do you understand me?
And you will stay on ship.
There will be no more mixing with the
degenerate natives of these islands.
By any of my officers.
Or by any of my crew.
You comprehend
my meaning, sir? Good.
Keep em' coming.
Move it along. Don't drop them.
Come on, Purcell. Remember
that's what we're here for.
And the next one please.
Come on. Keep them coming.
Good lads.
Alright. Where are they?
I don't know yet, sir.
We'll find them.
Damn fools.
Don't make it worse for yourself.
Stand up.
Stand up!
He can't, sir. Bit of trouble
with the locals out there.
You know the penalty
for desertion, mister?
We came back
of our own accord, sir.
You're a mindless animal,
Churchill.
I will decide your punishment
when you're fit to receive it.
Mr Cole!
Get Dr Huggen.
Aye, aye, sir.
Sir. Over here.
Is he dead?
Yes sir.
Poor bugger. Alright, bury him.
Will you organise
that please, Mr Cole?
Fletcher.
I've come to say good-bye.
You do not come back.
Do you?
Ever?
- I must go now.
- No.
Not yet. Soon.
Eyes front, Mr Christian!
Off hats.
Take the men below.
- Make sail, Mr Fryer.
- Aye, sir.
Stand aside.
Stand down.
Stand down!
Come on, lads.
No sense in this.
Well, gentlemen, between ourselves
and home are 27,000 sea miles,
the Endeavour Straits
and the Great Barrier Reef.
Now the crew is deeply
demoralised, gentlemen.
And I must accept,
as every captain must accept,
the inevitable and theoretical
responsibilty for that.
The actual and immediate
responsibilty, however,
I place on you,
my fellow officers,
who met this crisis
with lethargy, impudence
and flagrant defiance
publicly uttered.
And perhaps also for that,
I am to blame.
I counted on a strength of character
which you do not possess.
However, the cure
for our predicament is discipline.
And I shall apply it
with an even hand, of course,
but most
where it is most required.
Yes, well that will be all.
Thank you.
You may leave now.
Not you, Mr Christian.
Leave it. Now!
Alright, Smith, you may
go and close the door, please.
So. You think
I'm harsh with you, eh?
Look, I've been at sea many years,
Fletcher. Since I was twelve.
And I have seen many men,
many good men,
Iose their heads over native
women in these waters.
And I've never yet
seen it come out well.
Of course I understand
the excitement and... um.
But think to yourself, man.
Could you take a woman like that back
home to your friends and family?
No, of course you couldn't.
They're not like us, Fletcher.
You think I was harsh with you.
But you needed someone to show
you where your duty really lay.
Because you were
at a loss, my friend.
You may not thank me now
but you will later.
So, let's get the ship
running properly
and get back
to where we were before.
Now look, Fletcher.
Listen to me.
I am prepared to forgive
and I am prepared to forget.
Do you understand me?
Will that be all sir?
- Yes, that will be all.
- Thank you.
You sent for me, sir?
Yes I did. This ship is filthy,
Mr Christian.
Sir?
The ship is filthy, Mr Christian!
Look for yourself.
Look! Filthy, sir! Filth there!
And there! And there!
Look at there!
I understand you dismissed
the swabbing party.
You left these decks crusted
with grime. Look at it there!
Bloody disgrace.
Now you'll be well advised, sir,
to call them back again
and this time do it properly.
Do you understand me?
Filth Sir! Filthy Mr Christian.
Still filthy! Look!
I see nothing, sir, but your finger.
I'll not have your vile ways
brought aboard my ship, sir!
Do you understand?
Now you'll call up
the swabbing party, yet again!
And this time you'll make bloody sure
that the decks are clean!
Or by God
you'll answer for it sir!
I'll not have any of your filthy
gutter ways on board my ship!
Do you understand? Pigs in a sty
have more comprehension
or cleanliness
than you buggers have.
Now you'll get
these decks clean
or by God I'll make you
lick them clean with your tongues
if you don't mend your ways.
There is a thief among us.
Yes, there is a thief on board
this ship, which is unfortunate
because you know what hardship
that means for honest men.
Last night,
my personal store of coconuts
was well up
to the top of the netting.
This morning, I - Well
I mean look for yourselves. See.
Now if the thief will declare himself,
I will punish him alone.
And then
we can forget the matter.
Sir.
Hold your tongue, Goddamn you sir!
I'm addressing the crew, Mr Christian.
Who do you think you are?
Now if the thief
will not declare himself.
I took one.
You?
I was thirsty.
I took one of your coconuts.
I thought it of no consequence.
One coconut, Mr Christian?
A dozen were taken, man.
I know nothing of a dozen.
Then, unless you're a liar
as well as a thief,
the rest were taken
by other members of your watch
who look to you
for their example do they not, sir?
- Mr Cole.
- Sir.
Impound the personal stores of
every man on Mr Christian's watch
and put them on half rations.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Thank you. Stand down.
That isn' t a raft,
it's a coffin.
There's a five-knot current running
between here and that island.
I'll take my chance.
You think a lot of us
haven't thought of this?
You're not the only one
to have left a woman behind.
Fletcher,
the men are ready for anything.
What are you saying, Ned?
Are you inciting me to mutiny?
If I were you,
I'd take the ship. That's all.
Why don't you, then?
I said if I were you. I'm not.
What I have to say to you is
the result of considerable reflection.
Its consequences
would be two-fold.
Firstly,
our journey will be shortened.
Which I know is a consideration
that cannot distress you.
And secondly,
upon its successful conclusion
not one of you in later years
will look back without a surge of pride.
We shall go with the winds
to Jamaica by way of Cape Horn.
You'll kill us all.
What did you say, Adams?
We tried the Horn before.
It was almost the end of us.
Damn you, man.
Don't you bloody cross me.
Mr Cole, take this man below.
And tomorrow we will assemble
to watch him receive punishment
for cowardice
and insubordination.
Mr Cole.
Take him below, sir!
You, Mr Fryer.
Give him the makings.
Sir.
Now. We set out to circumnavigate
the globe. And by God we shall do it.
To the greater glory of us all.
Is that understood?
Thank you.
Now you may dismiss.
Enter.
- Can I have a word with you?
- I'm busy. Is it important?
I think, yes.
Be brief!
William, about your decision
to go around the Horn.
William? Not sir?
Not captain? William.
I don't think the men will have it.
Oh, the men won't have it.
Are they in charge of the Bounty?
They might be if you insist.
Again. Will you repeat that, please?
The men might be in charge.
What are you threatening me with?
It's not a threat, it's a warning.
Oh. There are rumblings,
are there?
No. There is fear.
Around the Horn
is the easiest way. The better way.
And that is
how we will go. Anything more?
Don't put Adams under the lash.
He was insubordinate.
Cowardly and insubordinate.
He frightened the men.
I did not put that fear there, he did.
So he will be lashed
and we will go around the Horn.
Are you frightened to go
around the Horn, Mr Christian?
Are you a coward too, sir?
There will be no killing.
Except Bligh.
There will be no killing.
We set him adrift.
Hi. Christian's taking the ship.
Are you with us?
Come on, wake up.
We're taking the ship.
- Wake up.
- Mmm.
- Wake up!
- Whaa!
Shut up. Christian's taking the ship.
Christian's taking the ship.
We're taking the ship. Are you with us?
Come on.
Come on, Fryer. Wake up!
Get up! Come on, Fryer!
Mr Bligh.
Will you get up? Get up.
Get up!
On your feet.
What the hell
do you think you're doing?
Tie him.
What are you doing?
Mr Cole! Mr Cole!
Come on, get up on deck.
Mr Cole! You'll hang, for this.
Mr Nelson.
We've taken the ship.
We've taken the ship.
We've taken the ship.
We've got Bligh. Get on deck.
Dance. Dance.
Easy.
Dance. Dance.
You shut up. Dance. Dance.
Come on. Get going.
You're a fool, Quintel.
You'll hang for this.
- Are you in this, Norton?
- No, sir I'm not.
Shut up your trap!
Desist this madness!
Be quiet!
Have you any conception
of what you're doing?
Just shut your mouth!
Are you in this, Adams?
It's all you fault. There was
never a coward on this ship!
You're a coward, sir!
And that was your mistake!
You're a blackhearted villian, sir!
Pritchard, get over here.
Stay there, Pritchard.
Stay Pritchard, you're a man.
Get over then.
Allison, get over here!
Shut up. I'm staying here.
Let's kill the bugger now, lads.
I said leave him!
You sodding bastards!
You take you hands off him!
Let's kill him.
Take your hands off him, now!
Kill him!
Get your hands off him. Now!
Mr Christian,
I appeal to you sir.
Put aside this madness and it will be
forgotten. I give you my word.
It's too late.
Think of my family and
my friendship. Think of my wife.
I am in hell. Hell, sir! Why are you
being so damn reasonable, now?
God damn your blood
to hell with mine, sir!
God damn your blood!
Mr Christian,
get a hold of yourself!
You be quiet
or I will run you through.
Do it, Christian. Kill him!
Just shut your mouth! Shut
your mouth! I will run you through!
And then I will kill myself after.
You get him dressed now.
Get him dressed!
Bastard!
What's the matter with you all?
You be quiet!
Gun him down, damn you!
They're common criminals.
Get out of it, Cole!
You will be silent or
I will have you killed! You bastard!
You do and you will have
my blood on your hands.
Stop!
Quiet! We will get him in the boat.
Set him adrift. Get him dressed!
Will someone
give me my britches?
Pass us your watch up here then.
Come on, move yourselves.
You blackguard! Traitors!
Mr Bligh, come here, please.
If you wish to leave some
of these men on the ship,
I give you my word
they will not be harmed.
Lads. One of you will have
to come out. There's no room.
Mr Fryer,
you come up here.
We'll do without him.
We don't want you.
Mr Fryer. Get up here.
Stay where you are.
Or I'll blow your head off.
God damn you!
You're the scum of the earth!
Fulman. Get up here.
Come on, Fulman.
Move yourself.
Faster, man.
It will be fairly reported that you were
not part of this rabble. Thank you.
Smith bring that chest to me.
Do it now.
Get in the boat.
What use is that without charts?
I need the charts. Turn around.
You really think you'll be able
to command this rabble?
I'll do my best.
Well, I did my best
and I had the authority of the law.
You're a dead man, Fletcher.
That's enough of that.
Get on the boat, sir.
Quickly.
You've not seen the last of me,
Ned Young. Take my word for it.
Thank you, Mr Lamb.
Or you, John Adams.
You've not seen the last of me.
- I wouldn't wager on it.
- We shall see, sir.
I'll see you hanged.
Veer them away.
- Did you bring anything, Smith?
- Yeah I got a carpent...
Veer them away...
Get ready, boys.
Get the oars out.
Sorry to see you go.
Isn't this what you came for?
Here you go.
Goodbye, boys.
Hope I never see you again.
If you get home,
tell my mother that I love her.
She's got a lovely
little Tahitian grandson.
Have a long ride, Tim.
I hope they bloody eat yer, Fryer.
I hope never
to see Fletcher Christian again.
Unless it is to see him hanged.
How could he betray my friendship
and kindness to him?
I can only assume he has decided
to return to a life in Tahiti.
After taking stock of the meagre
provisions allowed us,
I have decided to make
for the island of Tafuha
in the hope of supplementing
our supplies of food and water.
By now,
there are many natives about us.
And by their manner, we do not expect
our welcome to last much longer.
- Mr Cole?
- Sir.
You take charge of my log...
and slowly make
your way out to the launch.
- Easy, Mr Cole.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Go now?
Now. That's right.
You give me no summer,
my boys. Nasty bugger.
Come on lads.
Get in the boat! Lose that barrel.
Stop playing games.
Is that what you want?
Everybody in the boat!
Prepare to pull away!
Mr Bligh.
Where's the captain?
Where's Mr Bligh?
Over there.
Come on then.
Norton come back. You fool.
Mr Bligh!
What are you doing?
Get aboard, sir!
Mr Bligh.
Get back, you bastards!
Keep back, you bastards!
I'll have your eyes for footballs!
Get back in the boat!
Help the man.
Get in the boat, sir.
My God, no!
Row for your lives!
Take your clothes off.
Throw your clothes over!
Bloody savages!
We're chops and liver
to them if they catch us.
That's the spirit.
Come on, we'll do it.
We cannot risk going ashore again.
What are we going to do, sir?
Well, we shall just have
to try and reach Coupang.
Without charts?
Well, I shall have to navigate
from memory, Mr Fryer.
It'll take us close to the most
savage islands in these waters.
The Fiji islands where cannibalism
is perfected almost to a science.
And from there,
my friends, God willing,
we shall proceed onward
to the Great Barrier Reef itself.
Then
to the coast of New Holland
and from there across
the Timor Sea to Coupang.
Now it will take us
at least two months
and we have provisions or more
enough to last us one week.
So that is the situation,
gentlemen. Plain and simple.
Well, we'll just have to make
the best of it. Won't we sir?
Make the best of it, Smith?
Yes, but will you?
That's what I ask myself.
Will you make the best of it?
Do you hear me? Are you prepared
to make the best of it? All of you?
Because all I can promise you, lads,
is relentless pain and hardship.
Now, if you're prepared
to make do and make sacrifices
and furthermore
are willing to swear by it,
I promise you our chances
of survival are fair.
You hear me?
You all say, aye.
Aye.
Good.
Mr Fryer, make way.
Prepare to make way.
Make way.
Fletcher!
Fletcher!
In the box are gifts
for the people of Tahiti.
We did not expect you back. We have
already given you everything.
We only want our women. And perhaps
some men to help me sail the ship.
Where's Captain Bligh?
Why doesn't he come himself?
He's no longer with us.
I've taken the ship.
He's dead.
No. No, he's not dead. We set him
adrift with some of the crew.
You shame me by coming here.
You shame me.
King George
will send many ships
with many guns to punish us
for what you have done.
We can give you nothing.
Go now.
Some of the men would like to remain
here and wait for the next ship.
Er, they wanted to go with Bligh
but there was no room in his boat.
They can stay, but not you.
Take your gifts and go.
No!
Should she not be allowed
to choose for herself, sir?
Ah.
Where will you take her?
I don't know. Somewhere
the British ships won't find us.
Take her. You will have
all the men you need. Go now.
Goodbye, Peter.
Good luck, sir.
I think you'll need it more than I.
Thank you.
I'm not coming, Fletcher.
I've thought it out. And I'm staying here.
Let's go.
I think I'll stay too, sir.
Get out. Let's go.
Come on lads.
They'll hang you.
I might just have a lucky face.
Here they come. Get it. Good one.
Loads of them.
They're all over the place.
Here we go. There we go. Go on.
Sod it. Who loaded these things?
Come on, man.
Quick. Yeah!
The only one I wholly trust is Adams.
I go everywhere
with a loaded pistol.
And where we are to head beyond
the reach of justice, I know not.
Thursday June 11th.
In the afternoon we saw gannets
and many other birds.
And at sunset
we caught one in our sail.
Which I reserved
for our dinner next day.
Who shall have this?
Smith.
And who shall have this?
Mr Fryer.
What about the rest of us?
You just have to wait your turn,
Purcell, like everyone else.
Some of us
haven't had nothing in days.
That's enough, Purcell.
Well, it's not enough for me, sir!
I'll tell you something.
The officers
and their lot get everything.
Shut your mouth, Purcell.
I'm as much a man
as you are, sir.
What did you say?
I said
I'm as much a man as you are!
Are you indeed?
I'm not so certain about that.
Sit down, damn you!
I'll knock you on the head with it.
Sit down! Sit down!
Mr Cole,
give this man my share of food.
I am committed
to a desperate enterprise.
I have said farewell
to everything I've been accustomed
to regard as indispensable.
But I suppose
I have found freedom.
So you've found
freedom, have you?
Freedom, retribution,
that's what you want.
Isn't that
why you gave him your compass?
I wanted to give him a chance.
A chance to survive
so he'll come after us again.
How can he come after us?
He'll be marooned on some island.
I only wish to God I'd given
him muskets. Now get out.
At least
ten times we have touched land.
Only to find either barren rocks
or hostile inhabitants.
And once nearly ran
a foul of an English frigate.
Our stores are low.
The spirit of the men, even lower.
His royal highness
woken up at last, has he?
Given you a rest, has he, darling?
Fletcher wants you.
Ned, I found it. Listen.
Where is it?
July 2nd, we discovered an island,
seeming uninhabited. It was
well timbered. But we did not linger
for we could find no anchorage.
That's perfect.
Every ship in the Royal Navy has a
copy of that book and those charts.
They never drew it on the charts.
All they give is a latitude,
Now it seems to me, all we have to do
is simply sail along this line of latitude.
We'll find the island.
Somewhere.
And if we don't? These men need a
home, Fletcher. They've mutinied once.
Oh, they'll have a home.
Pitcairn's Island.
They'd better.
I can
no longer write for lack of strength.
Commend me to your parents
and our loving daughters.
Mr Bligh,
when my spirit is gone,
there will be nothing
but flesh remaining.
I beg you use that poor flesh
to save the others.
No, no, Mr Nelson.
We're civilised men not savages.
And as civilised men we shall die.
Have no fear.
Sir, we'd like a word.
We've had it up to here.
There is no island.
We want to turn back to Tahiti.
And who'll navigate?
You. You're the navigator.
I'll navigate.
This ship's going to Pitcairn's Island.
Sir!
Sir!
Smith.
It's land.
- What?
- I think it's land.
Mr Cole, you'll hoist the Jack.
It's not proper
to land without identification.
Oh. God.
Sir. I am Lieutenant William Bligh.
I'm a British naval officer
and I have
to report an act of piracy.
We've found it.
We've found it, Ned.
It's our island.
We could easily have missed it.
Yes.
We'll never get off this island now,
will we sir?
Never see England again.
This court finds that the seizure of
His Majesty's armed vessel, Bounty,
was an act of mutiny by Fletcher
Christian and others of her crew.
And that her captain, Lieutenant William
Bligh, is in the opinion of this court,
to be exonerated
of all blame on this occasion.
Indeed, in the matter of his command
of the Bounty's open launch,
we commend Lieutenant Bligh for his
courage and exemplary seamanship.
Will you please
come forward Lieutenant?
My Lord. Thank you.
