Now, Bernie, this is seriously, now,
this is where they asked us to meet?
- Yeah, whaddya mean?
- Oh, I think I see her.
- Where?
- Oh, that's gotta be her.
All right, so,
what are we gonna do?
Are we gonna grab a milkshake,
Buddy, is that why we're here?
Yeah, all right, I guess.
All right, you're
gonna owe me big for this.
- You think I shoulda worn the other shirt?
- You look nice.
I don't know, Gus, maybe she... what if she
don't like the look of me or somethin'?
Bernie, c'mon, are you sure,
are you serious? What about her?
Aren't you dyin'
to see what she looks like?
- No, she isn't a dog.
She could be.
I already know what she looks like
like, c'mon, Ed, she isn't a dog.
You've been talkin' to her
for weeks on the phone, right?
- Yeah.
- Right?
Yeah.
She likes ya,
from talkin' to ya, Bernie.
And I don't think ya gotta worry about
her gettin' a good look at ya...
that ain't never been your problem.
Let's go.
Come on.
I shoulda worn the other shirt.
I'm the one takin' the risk.
doublin' with some girl I never
even spoke to, let alone seen.
I don't know why this Miriam broad
says it's gotta be a double date anyway.
Maybe she's not sure about me yet.
- How can anybody not be sure about you, Bernie?
- Yeah, thanks, Gus.
Yeah, hey, don't tell the other guys
down at the station about this.
It's not like you never
been on a date before.
All set there?
are you Miriam?
No, I'm her friend.
She's...
Hi, how ya doin', I'm Gus?
- Catherine.
We'll talk again.
Bye.
Hi.
Wait.
You are Bernie Webber, right?
Yeah, yeah, I'm Bernie.
Hey, you two,
let's go grab drink.
- You wanna go?
- Sure.
How ya doin'?
- I'm Gus.
- Ya know...
For a minute there I thought it was Smokey
the Bear makin' a call in that booth.
'Cause of your jacket.
Miriam's never been on a boat.
- She's scared of the water.
- Has she never?
I told her I don't know how she's
gonna date a guy in the Coast Guard.
I'm not scared,
I live on the Cape.
Don't worry, Miriam, ya know, we...
we all get scared out there.
I'm not afraid of the water, Bernie.
It scares me at night,
that's all, ya know.
Ya can't see
what's underneath.
Just more water.
Ya know, I... I get funnier
as the night goes on.
So, well, why... why did you want
to meet me for a date? Wha...
Why did you wait so long?
I didn't know if you'd be a...
If... if I what?
- You know.
- No.
You are so handsome, I just didn't
know if you'd be attracted to me.
Oh, God, no, Miriam,
you're exactly how I pictured you.
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
Better.
You know what, my... my brother he
always says when you know, you just know.
- Which one?
- All of it, I guess everything.
- No, I mean which brother.
- Oh.
Paul, my brother Paul.
He's the one who fought over in Germany?
- In Germany, yeah.
He's the oldest,
father's favorite.
All three of my brothers
went over to the war.
Is your father's...?
We should get Miriam out on a boat tonight,
whaddya say, Buddy.
We take out the dory,
gonna be fantastic.
You know we can't do that,
Gus, we can get in trouble.
- Come on, Bernie, it'll be fun.
- Rules are rules.
No, we... we...
we don't gotta row out far.
Just as so this sweet girl can say
she's been on a boat.
A row boat? No!
No, no, no, small boats are...
How about one of those bigger boats...
tied up to the dock.
- If Bernie's with me, I'll do it.
- Old fishing boat?
Those fishermen don't want us around,
unless we're pullin' 'em in.
They think they own the God damned water.
They're not very nice.
- C'mon, don't be such a fathead, Miriam.
- Yeah.
Let's go out on the dory,
what's there to be afraid of?
What's underneath, right?
Hey, Mr. Stello, how's it goin'?
- Hey, Bernie.
- Mr. Ryder.
Hey, so you see that...
see that girl standin' over there?
The one with the coat,
looks like a bear bunny?
- Yeah.
- Can't miss her.
I said the same thing myself,
funny you should say that, yeah.
Looks like Smokey, right?
Smokey the Bear?
I don't know no Smokey, Bernie.
It's... it's just a cartoon.
Anyway Mr. Stello, she... she thinks
she's scared of goin' out on a boat.
And I don't think we
should row out on a dory,
I don't want to get her
sick on that nice big coat.
So I was wondering if...
So, you wanna take her on
the Anna G around the harbor?
Yeah.
even if you wanted, right, Bernie?
Carl, stop.
my sister's now livin' in my house.
How's it goin' with you, Bernie?
That's enough, Carl,
he did all he could.
I AM sorry, Mr. Nickerson.
I didn't mean to upset you, just wanted
to ask Mr. Stello about borrowin' a boat.
Gotcha! Gotcha!
Give me your hands.
It's okay.
Just follow my arms, okay?
Stay with me.
It's all about...
it's all about the rhythm.
Okay? So, it's... so, it's,
here we go.
One two three,
right left right.
I count one two three...
- Let's just sit down, Bernie?
- No, Sweetheart,
Look, all ya...
all ya gotta do is...
ya gotta relax and be patient
and settle in my hand.
Hey, look, just, here,
settle in my hand, ya feel that?
Just, listen to the music.
You're doing great.
Will you marry me?
What?
Will you marry me?
No.
Miriam, hold on.
It's cold, Sweetheart,
don't ya wanna go back inside?
The... the band's not through.
It's cold, ya feel that?
There's a storm coming.
Okay.
Okay, what?
Okay, let's get married,
I just... I don't wanna...
Wanna what?
Well, it's only been a few
months and it's still winter after all,
and... and... look, ya know,
there... there's a storm comin'
it's just like this one
come through last year.
What does that...
I heard it's gonna miss us.
Yeah, but maybe not, ya never know.
Ya never know.
There's some people just...
they're just not cut out for... for this.
Sometimes ya go out
and ya don't come back.
Are you talkin' about
the storm, or marriage, Bernie?
I think I'm talking about the storm, right?.
You're scared of a storm?
No.
I don't wanna disappoint nobody.
And...
I don't wanna you,
I love you.
So...
yeah, let's get married.
You sure?
Oh, yeah.
When?
You want me to pick a date?
No, when... when do you wanna get married.
- April 16th.
- Okay.
Okay, April 16th it is.
But... but I... but I... I gotta
ask permission from Cluff first.
Ya gotta ask permission?
Yeah, it's... it's from my commander,
it's Coast Guard regulation.
But, promise, I'll ask him tomorrow.
Okay, Bernie.
Let's get goin'.
Then you can dance.
Hon, look at that,
it's already startin' t'snow.
Can you hear me over this hummin', Captain?
That fracture they went over last month is
not gonna hold it in these seas, Captain,
it takes a bad jolt it
could fracture again.
I'll have to go and check,
I can hear it from right down here.
The whales is really hummin'.
I ain't topping, Sir,
the whales is... hummin'.
I'd like to take it down
to three knots please.
If we don't slow down, Captain,
we might not have a...
position to hold.
No problem, Cap'n.
Holdin' at seven knots,
thank you, Sir.
- Hey, Pop?
- I hear it.
Ya wanna go up on deck have a look at
those crack clusters holdin' that weld together?
You might as well go get a hat, Papo.
What did he say?
He says he'd like you to
consider taking a hat with ya, that's all.
Get some sleep.
Whaddya know about this weather,
it's killin' me and young Eldon here?
Tiny, ya sure it's the weather?
Maybe it's your singin'.
Come on.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
It's gonna get worse.
I didn't make it top side!
That weld can't hold in these seas!
Ya gotta slow her down.
I'm callin' the Captain back.
It's comin' in!
- It'll keep up?
- Yeah.
We've got a hull fracture
in the engine room!
blankets,
whatever you can get your hands yet.
Yeah, Bernie?
I can't get anyone on the bridge.
I need to go up and tell the Captain
we got an eighteen foot fracture in our hull.
Tell him these pumps are holdin' for now,
but we don't put her to port, we're gonna wreck.
The Cap'n don't understand me, Balou.
I know he can't understand you,
he don't listen to anyone anyway.
Cold out today?
- Yeah.
- Ya still tryin' to fix that darn thing?
- Yeah.
Ah, c'mon, Fitzy,
it's useless.
Let the guy who fixes
it to come fix it.
I would if he would show up.
What's this on the radio,
a ship breakin' up?
Reiss at Fort Mercer.
- Fort... Fort Mercer?
- She's a big lady, she's a T2 tanker.
Started radioin' a couple of hours ago,
apparently she's got a big crack in her hull,
it's spillin' oil all over the place.
She's about 20 miles east,
off of Nantucket.
It sounds like Boston and Nantucket
are sendin' out their entire fleet.
We could be next.
They're saying gale force winds,
She's gonna be a mess.
Miriam called for ya.
Yeah.
Good luck, Pal.
- Mr. Cluff.
It's me, Bernie, Sir.
Take yourself a crew, go out there help them
fishermen secure their boats to the pier.
Aye, yes, Sir.
Sir, I need to...
need t'ask you a question,
I need permission 'bout a...
'bout a girl
Permission, permission...
for a girl?
Fuck this guy, it's workin'.
- Yes, sir.
- Not now, Webber.
But, no, Sir, it... it's... it's not...
it's not just some girl, Sir.
Not now, Webber.
We're back up.
Cluster here is the Mercer Rescue, right?
This here other pip,
two miles from here...
We must still be gettin'
phantom echoes.
How we suppose to tell
when 'n' if it is out there?
When's that technician comin', Fitzpatrick,
and where the hell's Chief Bangs?
It's "Fitzgerald", Sir.
Chief Bangs is in the mess hall, Sir.
You makin' fun of accent
'cause I'm not from around here?
No, Mr. Cluff.
- Why are you still standin' here, Webber?
- Sir, but...
go up top them fishin' boats.
- Yes, sir.
- Ya want me to go with Webber, Sir,
to secure fishing boats?
You didn't hear me, Livesey, I...
yeah, you with Webber.
Sorry, Rich, his orders, ya know.
That's enough time, whaddya think?
We're takin' on water inside,
we gotta launch some lifeboats.
You're such a jackass, Brown.
The least we can do, pray for
the Captain, Chief Collagen,
the rest of them men,
all good men.
Hey, ain't we good men, Quirey?
prayin's great, but it ain't everything.
We need to actually do something.
A word.
That hothead Brown,
he wants to launch the lifeboats.
- The lifeboats?
- Quirey, he wants to do nothin'.
And between them, the two of them
are getting the men worked up.
I figure that you know the boat better than
anybody, you're practically married to it, so...
- I think they'll listen to ya.
- Listen to me?
Half those men don't like me.
Nobody on the ship likes me,
me and Tchuda.
They might not like ya,
but they'll never listen t'ya.
We don't know if the
Captain got off an SOS.
The radio room's gone,
we can't call nobody.
Now it's just... just Garcia over here with
a little shortwave trying to pick up chatter.
I mean, as far as we know,
nobody even knows we're out here.
Now, I'm sayin' we launch some lifeboats
now and get off this ship while you can.
How you gonna get
'em down in the water in this storm?
It can't be done, those boats are
too small, it's suicide, Brown.
You can't do this,
you can' do dat,
whaddya want us to do, Quirey,
just sit up here, do nothing?
every man for himself.
That ain't the way, Brown.
That never did nothin' for nobody.
Now, the ship's split,
but the bulkheads separating
tanks eight and nine,
Now,
aren't fractured, so...
the air in the ballast tanks
should keep us afloat.
- Mr. Sybert says this, Mr. Sybert says that,
he's a big boy, let him say
it himself, he's right here.
G'ahead.
We're sinkin'.
Yeah, but the whistle works.
So, we should keep blowin' that,
maybe somebody'll hear it.
I don't know, but we're definitely sinking.
The crack in the engine room
is takin' on too much water,
the pumps can't keep up.
If the water reaches the air intake in
the engine, we're gonna lose all the power.
If we lose all the power, we lose the
pumps, and if we lose the pumps...
she's gonna drop pretty quick.
How long have we got
before that happens?
Four, maybe five hours.
Well, we need to buy
ourselves some time.
So somebody can find us.
If anybody's even lookin'.
Even if they do know we're
here,  the sea is big enough.
I mean it'd rip this thing in half.
How the hell we gonna get out?
That's why I'm sayin' we
gotta launch some lifeboats.
- Our luck's runnin' out.
- I don't believe in luck, Brown.
Put those lifeboats in those
seas, they won't last 12 seconds.
You and Quirey both you just
wanna sit around and do nothin'.
You got a better idea, Sybert,
or you just go back hide down below?
We'll run her aground.
Do what?
We're gonna run her aground, Sybert?
Even if you could with
half a ship, why would you?
Just break apart,
dump us all out in the sea.
we're gonna
find a soft shoal and we'll lay 'er up,
slow the water that's comin' in,
stay in the same spot,
we'll blow the whistle,
we'll give whoever's comin'
to look for us a chance to find us.
We're gonna steer a
ship without hydraulics?
That's your plan?
How's that gonna work?
I'll build a manual tiller.
Hey, Sybert, why should
we even listen to you?
The only thing you ever cared about was
this ship, ya know, I'll tell you what...
You two make a cute couple at
the bottom from the ocean.
Me? I'm gonna get onto a lifeboat.
Look.
We'll insert a steel beam
into the steering quadrant.
We'll put pulleys on the
end of it for leverage...
and then we'll move 'er manually.
Excuse me.
I think I got the radio working.
Bearing 83 degrees true, 27 miles from Pollack
Rip Light, about 20 miles east of Nantucket.
East of Nantucket?
That ain't the Pendleton.
- Fort Mercer, that's another T2.
Another tanker split in two.
But if everyone's gonna
help them, who's gonna...
who's gonna come for us?
How you feelin'?
You all right?
- Did you... did you ask Cluff yet?
- No.
Why didn't you ask him?
- What's wrong with you?
- I think I got one more...
- Webber!
- What?
- You asked him yet, you ask Cluff?
I told you not to tell nobody.
- I'm sorry, I'm not havin' a very good day.
- I know you're not feelin' well...
Webber, you don't need
permission to get married.
- Actually, you do Chief.
- Unless you're underage.
Thanks, Chief, just followin' regulations.
Let's go get suited up.
It's not regulation, Webber,
it's just a formality, like a courtesy.
And hey!
Did I hear right, that she asked you?
Followin' orders, right, Webber?
Yeah, she asked me, Chief.
Are you sure you're got your pants
on, Webber, or is she wearin' 'em?
Sounds like this girl
cut off your pe...
What, Webber?
What? Huh?
Don't ya got boats t'tie up?
She's... she's my fiancée, Sir.
Who asked you...
to be married.
Cluver's here, let's go.
One moment.
I'm not sure.
I'm sorry, Sir,
please speak up.
This line is bad, Ma'am,
I'll try and re-connect.
Please, sir, the lines are down.
Bernie? How are ya? How's work?
It's been one of those days,
ya know, but how are you?
- Hey, you're not the
radar technician, are ya?
- Ah, no.
I was ordered to hole up
here until the storm passes,
catch a ride back
on that lightship.
You can go wait in the
mess hall if you want to.
Now is not a good time, ya know.
I gotta get ready and go down
to the pier, tie up some boats.
I wish you were here with me.
I'm hearin' all sorts of
things about a shipwreck and I... oh.
What, are you okay?
Yeah, we just lost our lights.
You better go find 'em, then.
- They're 36 foot at the Mercer.
- You ask Cluff yet? That's him, right?
No, not yet, Sweet.
- I'll explain later. I
- Okay.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
Yeah, bye.
The best part,
she had no idea who I was.
Maske,
take
the 36-500 outta Old Harbor,
proceed to the Fort Mercer, 20 miles
east of here off Nantucket, ya hear?
we'd get over
the bar in this weather, Mr. Cluff.
We're better off takin'
the 36-383 outta Stage Harbor.
Well, it would take longer, right?
Not much.
What do you think, Webber?
You're a boatswain, too,
you know what it's like out there.
Yeah, look, no one's gettin' over the
bar in this weather, Mr. Cluff, nobody,
it's a suicide mission.
We should take the
It would take longer, sure,
but at least we'll be able to get out.
Godspeed, Chief.
- Webber, take Gouthro and
Livesey down the fishing pier.
- Yes, Sir.
Don't get me sick, Gus,
we shouldn't even be out here.
Why you always raggin' on us, Richie?
Don't take it out on us
'cause you you went wrong with Bangs.
- At least they get out.
- Screw you, it was a year ago.
Screw you.
- No one coulda got over the bar that day.
- Bangs coulda.
No, really, Richie,
he's not tryin' to get across the bar today.
No, said he did 36-383 right
out from the nice, protected bayside.
Well, Bernie, it doesn't matter what Richie here thinks,
or Bangs or Nickerson or nobody.
Nobody coulda got out to
save the men on the Landry.
Sometimes, ya know,
sometimes men die, Bernie.
All right, here we go.
All right, hang on,
now easy, fellas.
- I got it.
- Okay, up, up, up.
One two, all together now.
Three.
Tie it down, boys, I got it.
All right, now we got a tiller,
we're gonna drive her up on a shoal.
Uh-uh, Brown and them others, they're
gettin' ready to launch those lifeboats.
They think it's their best hope.
Oh, Pop.
- We need every guy we got.
- Well, they're gonna take the lifeboats.
- What are you trying to do, Sybert?
- Get off him.
You fuckin' tryin' to kill us?
You tryin' to kill us?
- You're out of your mind!
- He just saved your life! Okay?
The boat's in pieces, it's gone!
Enough!
That boat is too small for these seas.
And this ship will
be sunk by nightfall.
Now, every fella here wants to
live, the only way that happens...
is if we run her aground.
Set up a watch and
look out for a shoal.
I need four men working the
pulleys on the emergency tiller.
I need four men manning the
pumps,  aft of steering.
And the rest of you on
the fuckin' line topside,
Down below! Communicate
with the engine room!
And somebody...
keep blowin' that whistle.
You heard him, boys,
now move it, c'mon.
It sounds like you're
the man now, Sybert.
I hope you didn't just kill us all.
I saw a ship sinkin',
heard it whistle.
A distress signal.
from my house.
With the wind blowing south,
and those currents, I, uh...
I guess that's what occurs here
about now comin' up over the bar.
It can't be part of the Mercer, Bernie.
She's off Nantucket 40
miles southeast of here,
means she woulda
drifted Northwest then, right?
I know what I heard.
Know what I saw.
Well, okay then...
How 'bout we go back to the Station,
see if we can get to the bottom of it?
Just got off the phone with Boston.
They diverted a
plane from the Mercer,
and it sighted the stern of the
tanker Pendleton 5 miles east of here.
My God, two tankers broken in half in one
day, that's gotta be some kind of record.
Boston and Nantucket have
dispatched all their boats to the Mercer.
They can't make it
here in this weather.
Webber,  take
that 36-500 out and you go over the bar,
and you find the stern of
the Pendleton, ya hear?
Yes, sir.
Do you fellas wanna get
warmed up, get some coffee?
What?
What Carl's tryin' to say...
- This isn't about the Landry.
- Sure it is.
Eight men died that night.
You and Gus and Masachi
couldn't even get out.
What makes you think
you can do it now?
- You know the bar
on this kinda day, right, Bernie?
- Yeah.
That man in there don't know
what he's doin', he's sendin' you out to die.
You can't make it over
Chatham bar on a day like this.
You can't stay afloat for
long on half a ship neither.
Ya know, Mr. Stello, in the Coast
Guard they say ya gotta go out...
but they also say ya
gotta come back in.
That's regulations, ya know.
get lost
before you get too far out there.
Don't worry about me, Mr. Ryder,
I can't get lost out there,
I know those waters pretty good.
How can I get lost?
No, no, no, Bernie, what Dave's
tryin' to say, ya should just...
motor around the harbor,
say you tried to get out, and couldn't.
Ya know?
Thank you, Mr. Ryder, thank you..
But, Mr. Stello, I'm gonna
do my best to... to get out there.
I don't know if I will,
but I'm gonna try.
It's okay.
I guess Richie's in?
Who else?
I don't know, Gus, you
can hardly lift your head.
Who else you gonna take, Bernie?
Fitz is the only other engineman left.
And he's only third class,
and he don't got the experience.
I... I'll go, yeah, I... I can...
I can... I can do the job.
I mean, I can do it,
what, I mean, you... you can't go.
You... you're as sick as a dog, Gus.
He's right, Gus.
One more.
Well, someone has to go out
there and save those guys, right?
That's why I signed up.
Guess now's my chance.
Seaman Ervin Maske,
Stone Horse lightship.
Pumps aren't keepin' up.
Three more feet...
then we lose the engines.
Did you lock that
boiler rooms full?
You're crazy to think you can steer a boat
with a few ropes and a handmade tiller, Bud.
You got a better
idea I'm all ears.
There!
A shoal about a mile distance.
We can make that!
Rudder, 15 degrees to port,
half speed if we wanna hit it head-on.
Gotta make her turn 80
degrees on the compass to 3-10.
Rudder, 15 degrees port, half
speed, 80 degrees to 3-10 on compass.
Rudder, 15 degrees port, half
speed, 80 degrees to 3-10 on the compass.
Rudder, 15 degrees port half speed...
Rudder, 15 degrees port, half speed...
Rudder, 15 degrees port, half speed...
...15 degrees port, half speed...
Rudder, 15 degrees port, at half
speed, 80 degrees to 3-10 on compass.
Thank you, Eldon.
All right, you guys, now
pull, pull, pull, pull, come on!
Please tell me we're takin'
that boat to a bigger boat.
- You ever been on a rescue mission before?
- No.
Usually I just chip paint,
sometimes I cook for the boys.
Great!
- All right, you... you take the glory hole.
- Maske, Ervin Maske.
Ervin, yeah.
Richie, drop the mooring
line when you can.
The last known position
of the Pendleton is here.
So I... I figure once we cross the
bar, I reckon with the currents...
she'll have drifted about
here, that's 6 miles from us.
So you think Bernie can
get us out past bar on this?
I never seen
anything like it.
Yeah, I mean he's just gotta be sure
that he doesn't pitch-bowl us, that's all.
Huh?
The power in the waves in that bar
they can pick ya up, they can turn
ya end for end over and over again.
There's no way to survive that,
that's a pitch-bowl.
- Hey there, Fitz, we good?
- All right, give it a shot!
- Free the lines!
- Lines free.
- Did Bernie go out, Gus?
- Miriam, what are you doing here?
- Did he?
- Yeah, sent him.
I want to talk to him.
- Who?
- Cluff.
Your commanding officer,
where is he?
I want to find out where Bernie is,
I'm worried about him.
We're supposed to get married.
Miriam, this isn't what the
other girls do... or wives.
They don't come in here,
and they don't do this.
So?
I guess... you... you can
wait in here, listen to what's going on.
Sit down.
Tide's risin',
coulda work us off that shoal.
- We need to hit it hard.
- Yeah, there's no other way.
Wave!
- You feel that? She's drifting.
- Must've lost the tiller.
We gotta slow her headway or
we're gonna miss the shoal for good.
Close the governor valve, cut the
propulsion, we gotta isolate the boiler.
We gotta conserve
everything she's got left.
I keep tellin' ya...
this boat's just bad luck.
It's got nothing...
to do... with luck.
Station Chatham,
this is the CG-36-500, do you copy?
This is Station Chatham, 36-500,
what is your location. Over.
Station Chatham, we are...
we are now passing Morris Island,
heading down the channel
towards Chatham bar. Over.
- What's it mean going over that bar?
- Now, Miriam, don't do this to yourself.
Why not?
Why not, Gus?
If I'm gonna be with him,
I wanna know.
- You're the girl with the bear-coat, right?
- Yeah...
Yeah, that's me.
You gonna tell me what's
it's like out there?
Shoals on that bar are never
in the same place twice.
Flood currents carry
them big ocean swells
that rise up when they hit,
the shallows crash up against that bar.
The outgoing tide crashes
up against that bar.
That man shouldn't'a sent them out
to cross that bar in a storm like this.
maybe they get lost BEFORE.
Can't get out.
You know Bernie, right?
You know he won't
get lost out there.
You know he follows the rules.
Yeah, we know.
We all going down to the pier soon,
see if there's anything we can do down there.
Welcome to come.
Miriam, Miriam,
please come here.
Miriam?
- Excuse me, are you Commander Cluff?
- Who are you?
I'm Miriam Pentinen, Bernie Webber's
girlfriend, I want you to call Bernie back in.
The girl he was askin' me about,
do you know what he was gonna ask me?
For your permission to marry me.
Well, that's between you,
him and your god.
Asking me is just a formality,
he can marry all he wants.
Don't you know that?
But you can't be in here, Miss.
It's Bernie.
- Chatham bar dead ahead. Over.
- 36-500, Station Chatham,
Proceed as directed,
towards Pendleton's stern.
I didn't copy that, Station Chatham,
the conditions are extreme.
Why give him permission if
you're sending him out to die?
What the hell!
Gouthro, get her outta here!
Sir, wind's have gone from 40 to
- That's gonna hurricane strength in an hour.
- Gouthro, he got his orders.
You get her outta here, and you get
yourself to bed, you're too sick to be in here.
proceed over the bar.
I repeat, proceed.
Once over,
travel directly south,
the radar's intermittent
but it's showin' a pip.
Point, movin' south. Over.
Station Chatham, this
is the 500... copy that.
I hear what everyone's sayin'.
You don't know
what you're doing.
Excuse me?
Maybe... maybe it's because
you're not from here.
You don't know what
it's like out there.
What the hell would you know
what it's like out there, Miss? Hmm?
Please just call them back.
What do you think it's gonna be like
being married to a Coast Guard man?
Please, call just them back.
You gonna come in here, scared,
every time he out on the water?
- Please call them back.
- YOU, don't belong here.
- Please call them back.
- Get out of here! Get outta my station!
- Please call them back.
Get out my station!
Shoal's getting behind us.
Only chance now is a harder turn,
if the chains hold, but...
it could capsize us.
That's good work.
You need to stand clear, boys.
Those shackles crash and these chains
snap and they'll rip right through ya.
Here we go.
Gotta her movin' there.
You hear that?
That's it! That's... that's the bar.
Coupla minutes now, boys.
Hey... hey boys, we won't be
able to see much, all right?
So I have to listen to those waves
hittin' that bar... gotta time it.
So I'm gonna wait for
a low and then we go.
We got faith in you, Skip.
Anytime you're ready,
you just go, Bernie, all right?
The compass is gone.
Fitzy, the engine died.
- I got it, I got it.
- Nah, you don't.
You got about five seconds, boys.
- It's gravity pad, it doesn't... no way trace out...
- I know!
Come on, turn it on!
Maske? Get back here.
Tide's rising!
It'll get us through.
But let me know what's coming.
Hey Fitz! We made it over
the bar, back to spotlight!
Comin' out.
We turned too late!
We gotta buy that time back!
Tell Sybert we need 30 degrees in the
next two minutes or we'll miss that shoal.
- We're puttin' her in reverse.
- You gonna let the ocean push us.
Hold on.
You may wanna brace yourself, Eldon.
Close it down as soon as she hits!
Gentlemen!
Brace yourselves.
Hold on!
Now!
Well...
You did it! It bloody
well worked, Mr. Sybert!
You gotta keep the water away
from the air inlets to the engine.
We lose power,
we lose our pumps.
I'm afraid they're takin' on so much water
and the wave'll pull us right back off the shoal.
Feels funny to not be
movin around, huh, Eldon?
All right, let's get to it.
We're headin' down the lodge,
everything okay?
Quiet down now, my God,
give me a break.
I was on my way home,
my car spun out into a ditch.
I need some help.
Yeah, all right,
we live near here.
We can go back to my house, I'll call
my brother, he can pull you out, jump in.
- Thank you.
- You don't got a coat?
You can move that, we're bringin' it down
to St. Martin's in case ther're any survivors.
- I... I left my coat at the Coast Guard station.
- Ya gotta man there?
Stop it.
He is not there now right now, it's a...
- Bernie Webber?
- Yeah, Bernie he's a good man.
We can't find them
without a compass, Bernie.
We got no idea where they are.
Hold on.
You okay?
- You okay?
- I'm havin' a great time now, Bernie!
A whole lotta fun.
Brace yourselves!
Whole lotta... a whole lotta fun here.
- C'mon, take it, use it.
- Consider it done.
- We lost the pumps.
- The pumps are tripin' the breakers.
- I'll go check the connections.
Give me the light.
It's not worth a damn.
Sometimes I wish I didn't understand you.
Sybert, what's goin' on?
We're usin' every pump we got.
We jammed the breakers so
the pumps wouldn't trickle.
We got about two feet till the water
hits those air inlets to the
engine and then the ship's dead.
- Jesus Christ.
- Do you hear that?
That's the tide's rising
gonna work us off this shoal.
- Butt luck.
- This'll at least give us some time.
- Isn't that right, Mr. Sybert?
- That right, sure it is, Bud.
Yeah, as long as we got a
generator that's keepin' the pumps goin'.
By whoever might be comin'
to find us, we'll buy a little time.
You wanted be to be the man,
Sybert, now you the man, right?
Except you got no wife,
you got no kids back home.
You're a single man... always hidin'
down below, what do you gotta lose?
All right,
that's enough, Brown.
I'm scared to, Brown.
I gotta a life the same as you.
Just don't see the point in
sittin' around talkin' about it.
Station Chatham, 36-500,
Station Chatham, 36-500, do you copy?
Station Chatham,
this is Chief Bangs, CG-36-383,
Pollock lightship,
CG-36-500, do you copy?
Why can't they hear us,
Bernie, we hear them?
- Station Chatham, do you copy?
Repeat, we're comin' home.
Station Chatham this is 36-383,
return to Old Harbor.
Pollock lightship,
CG-36-500, do you copy?
We are all alone.
You heard, Bangs on the Radio, it
sounds like he couldn't get out, goin' back in,
storm is getting worse.
We should turn back in, Webber.
further than anybody thought was possible!
Maybe Richie's right,
maybe we should just go back!
Weather report says 8 to 9, repeat,
wind reported 8 to 9, heavy...
You heard Bangs on the radio.
We have no compass,
we have no way to communicate.
- You are...
- What? What? I'm what, Ritchie?
I brought us this far, didn't I?
Not Bangs, not Cluff, not nobody else... I did it!
We did it, Richie.
You wanna turn back around?
No, no, not now,
we came too far.
We are not gonna leave 'em.
Not on my watch.
Just do your job.
Turn off the beam,
Fitz, we're gonna in dark.
Better shot at seein' light from
the Pendleton if we're runnin' dark.
Watch it.
Get back here.
Get your butts back here!
I lost my hat.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah,
I'm just tired, come on.
You kids go on and
play in the bedroom.
You can wait with them, Megs
while I call my brother.
Thanks, please call me Miriam.
You think your mother would
mind if I turn on the radio?
Coast Guard Boston,
this is the Unimak.
We're at the Mercer bow now,
here in support of the Yakutat.
Four Mercer crew men jumped
from the deck, all were lost.
Repeat, four men lost.
Several crew members have hypothermia.
We're gonna for daybreak to
attempt another rescue. Over.
Does no good listenin' to all that chatter,
Miriam... better learnin' live not knowin'.
...at roughly 1900 hours we...
- How long you been married to Bernie for?
- We're...
We're not married yet.
- I didn't know if I...
- Like I said, Bernie, he's a good man.
Him and some of them others
try gettin' out a year ago,
save my husband Arnie and
the crew of the Landry.
They're out fishin'
marlin near Nantucket Sound
when the boat started takin'
on water, night just like this.
Come on, we gotta get goin'.
Brother's on his way to come meet us.
I gotta get down to the lodge, come on, you two.
Do you know who she is?
Ain't Bernie's fault, Carly,
nobody's fault, it's like her blaming you.
For what?
You're the one that told me there was no other ship
there, they're out there because of you, right?
Fitz, turn on the searchlight.
I can't believe we found her,
look at that!
We're too late,
she's a ghost ship.
- Are you seeing this, Sir?
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I see him.
Not sure I believe it.
Where is the hell's he goin'?
Good to see you, boys.
Careful.
- How we gonna fit them all on this boat?
- We're only built to hold 12, including us.
That's just regulation though, right?
How many could he fit?
Twenty, twenty-two tops.
Wait.
They comin' down here.
Drag to station, port side.
Come on, I gotcha.
We got ya.
Maske, get over here!
Come on!
Grab him!
You know where you goin' now, Miss?
I think so.
Thanks for your help, Mr. Nickerson.
Yeah.
You know...
- Bernie ain't out there, 'cause of me.
- Yeah, I know.
It's Bernie's job to go out, right?
How can I blame me for it?
Nice and slow! Nice and slow!
You're all right!
- Stop pushing!
- Pete, you're next.
- Take it nice and slow! Easy! Easy!
- Come on.
We gotta go!
We're leavin' nobody behind.
- Get on that ladder.
- We gotta get him down.
We don't have enough time.
She's slippin',
we gotta get off this ship.
Hurry!
Eldon, how you doin'?
I'm scared.
Well...
- it'd be a lot scarier up here without us.
- You gotta listen to me!
- Eldon?
- We're all gonna get off, stop pushin'!
You just follow right behind me...
if I can do it, anyone can.
Come on.
Hold tight!
Tiny! Tiny! Hold on!
Eldon.
Eldon, look at me!
Look at me!
When I say, "jump", let go!
Ready?
Jump!
You okay?
Hold tight.
They're ridin' so heavy,
you can hardly see her.
They're saying there's
Maybe...we take these guys
back in... come back out.
Can't leave 'em out here
alone, that boat won't last.
We all live or we all die.
Right?
You... you did good.
You should be the last one off,
Mr. Sybert.
Last man!
Hey Fitz!  Turn off
that searchlight, yeah?
We were in radio
contact with the McCullough,
and I said they lost 4 men, but saved the
rest. The captain of the Pollock Rip sent word...
- Mr. Cluff, it is 36-500, it's Bernie
- The guy's on the radio!
Chatham, Chatham, you copy?
CG-36-500, this Station Chatham.
Webber, is that you?
Yes, Sir, it's me, Bernie.
32... 32 survivors aboard
from... from the sinkin' Pendleton, Sir.
Station Chatham, do you copy?
say you have 32 survivors onboard.?
- They rescued 'em, they rescued 32 of them.
- Yes sir, 32.
We... we... we lost our compass,
so we don't know where we are,
but we're gonna try
to make it back home.
- Can't get back without a compass.
- Not in this weather.
Can they make it back?
You lost your compass, Webber?
Negative, 36-500, this is the Pollock
lightship, do not proceed to shore.
We're 5 miles northeast of the
Pendleton's last known location.
- CG-36-500, Station Chatham,
proceed to Pollock lightship
and unload all survivors. Over.
What do they know, right?
Right, Richie?
CG-36-500, do you copy?
If they know where they are...
someone tell me where I am 'cause
I don't know where the hell we are.
Webber, do you copy?
- I'm not headin' out to sea... no.
- This is Station Chatham, do you copy?
We just got you all off a...
off a boat,
so there's no way we're...
we're gonna get you all up there.
CG-36-500, this is Station Chatham.
Webber, your orders are to proceed
five miles northeast and unload
all survivors onto the Pollock.
It sounds like there's a cut off his
radio, Mr. Cluff... he's going it on his own.
Bernie Webber.
What do you know?
How are they gonna
find their way home?
He shut off the radio.
- Poor, poor boys.
- I can't believe this is happenin'.
There's more stuff in the car.
The power's out.
The whole town,
the power's out.
- It's worse than last year.
- Ya never know.
Let's get to the pier.
How did you find us
without a compass?
We... we just jogged along
with the seasonal currents.
I think we just got lucky.
- Yeah.
- Yeah...
Lucky.
Well, you know how you get home?
To be honest with ya, I'm not sure.
Just... disobeyed all my ranking officers.
They don't know,
so I guess I... I'd better, right?
With the wind on my left goin' out,
even if I... keep it her on my right,
we oughta be headin' the right direction.
We follow the lights onshore,
follow all the lights onshore.
Well, we are in your hands, Cap'n.
Listen up.
I'm puttin' the sea behind us.
Just let it push us along,
till we land up somewhere.
The storm's... the storm's
easing' up, boys, so...
we just look for the lights
on the shore to guide us in.
Even if we have to go so far as Nobska Point.
So be it! We just gonna find land!
It's been one heck of a
long day, right fellas?
Yeah, it sure has!
But don't you give
up hope on me now.
It's a good boat,
she'll get us through.
We'll get you home, okay?
We're all goin' home.
We're with you, Skipper.
- Keep the lights on, like SHE'S doin'!
- Quick! Turn your lights on!
Turn on the lights, everyone.
More light,
so that they can see us.
I think we made it over the bar.
That high tide carried us over!
You see that?
Fitz, turn on the searchlight.
- Look, you see that?
- Is that our boys!
It's them?
Well done, Bernie!
- You did it, Webber!
- Well done, Webber!
36-500 is now docking
at the Chatham pier.
There appear to be 32 survivors, Sir.
Repeat, we have 32 survivors.
Atta boy! Bernie.
Give me a hand.
C'mon, good to see ya.
Take it easy!
- This man's freezing, get me a coat.
Go on in, it's warm inside.
Let's get you up to the lodge.
Good job, Cap'n.
Well done, Bernie.
Webber?
Bernie.
Let's go.
We still got till April 16th.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I asked Cluff for ya.
- He said it's just a formality.
- Formality.
Now I know, right?
