Mrs. Claus is hot!
My name is Samantha Caine.
At least, I think it is.
You might not believe it,
but I was born only eight years ago...
on a beach in New Jersey.
I entered the world fully grown,
wearing clothes I don't remember buying.
In the back pocket,
a single key filed blank and faceless.
Fitting metaphor,
but otherwise no help whatsoever.
None.
Sometimes I stand naked in the mirror.
Try to guess my age.
Maybe 35?
I have lots of scars.
They call my condition
"focal retrograde amnesia."
It's no picnic,
but I've learned to live with it.
Got a job I love.
Been seeing someone.
Nice guy.
Good sense of humor.
-Hound of the Baskervilles.
-Mad dogs.
-Hal?
-Yes, Sam.
Of all the Christmas pageants
I've ever seen...
this is by far
the most recent.
For God's sake, Sam, I have
teenage girls playing the wise men.
-What did you expect?
-Teenage boys?
I thought they did fine.
It was the first Nativity where
Joseph stares at the wise men's tits.
Her name is Caitlin.
When I woke up on that long-ago day,
I was two-months pregnant with her.
I don't know who her father is.
I may never. I just know she's mine.
His name is Mr. Perkins.
My mom named him for me.
Caitlin, come help in the kitchen!
That's her.
-That's who?
-Her mom.
She's got amnesia.
Swear?
Swear.
Too weird.
Hello, girls.
Caitlin, come help me
in the kitchen.
Hurry up,
I forget where it is.
Raymond!
Catch you smoking, they'll never
find the body. Understand?
Yes, Ms. Caine.
Have a cookie.
As the year draws to a close...
I would like to share with you
just a few things about myself.
Things of which
I am especially proud.
First, I'm proud to say that...
I don't smoke...
I don't drink...
and I don't swear.
Oh, shit,
I do smoke and drink.
To our dear friends.
May the best of your past
be the worst of your future.
I'll drink to that.
Take a bow, my dear. Take a bow.
We got the mistletoe.
Eight years.
Except for my name,
all traces are lost.
I used to hire expensive detectives.
Now I use the cheap ones.
Doesn't seem to matter.
The woman I was...
the one I used to be,
she's gone.
I've kissed her goodnight.
Police! Don't move!
What the hell is this?
Don't give me attitude, sir.
You're assuming I won't shoot
your sorry ass.
When you make an assumption,
you make an "ass" of you and "umption."
I'm Sgt. Madigan, Vice,
and if you do cop a 'tude...
I will see to it you spend the next
If the case is thrown out
because my arrest was violent...
I will hire men to ass-fuck you
for the next ten years.
So if you're an ass-fucking fan...
go ahead and mouth off.
Meanwhile, you're under arrest
for the crime of prostitution.
Officer Dunleavy...
read him his rights.
-What?
-His rights.
You have the "remight"--
You have the right
to remain silent.
Anything you say and do...
will be held against you--
Please, listen, I got a wife.
I never.
This is the first time...
I've ever done this.
I swear!
Sir! Listen to me.
I can see from your choice here,
you're not a wealthy man.
Because of the damage
this arrest could do to you...
I think we might be able
to make an arrangement.
Oh, God!
Gotta stop using bums.
Forget that.
They looked like cops.
We pulled it off, didn't we?
It was embarrassing.
You want me to hire actors?
These guys are cheap.
They work for food.
When they puke,
is that a like a refund?
I'm pissing myself
you're so funny.
-What's this?
-I got movement on Samantha Caine.
Really?
No, I may have a lead on someone...
who rented Amnesia Chick
an apartment back in 1987.
They may still have
some of her stuff.
Get outta here.
Where'd that come from?
Lucky break.
Old lady died, and one of her
asshole grandkids found a credit card...
with the name Samantha Caine on it.
Tried to use it at Nordstroms.
Okay, here's what we do.
Get on the phone to Amnesia Chick.
Tell her we need more cash.
That was a really swell party.
Thanks again for the ride.
You and Hal have been together,
what, a couple of years?
How often do you two...
Stick our fingers in our hands and
pull them out? Every chance we get.
Earl, do me a favor? Every few words
blow bubbles and say "hic."
Goddamn it, I'm not drunk!
I'll prove it to you.
Come on.
Stop that!
I'm sorry.
And so much for the skydiving Santa
of Hutchinson County.
Meanwhile, WICC news...
journeyed to Honesdale, where Santa's
own Mrs. Kringle turned out...
to celebrate her hubby's
worldwide tour.
And after one look at her,
I'm thinking...
Santa got what he really wanted
this Christmas.
The parade included floats
and participants from four counties.
Everyone enjoyed themselves,
especially the young...
and the young at heart.
Gotta be fucking kidding!
No!
No fucking way!
It's impossible!
You rest up...
and I'll see you in the morning.
Sweet dreams.
I want a cigarette.
I don't smoke.
You used to.
See how easy it comes back?
I'm coming back.
You know that, don't you?
Name's Charly by the way.
You're going to love me.
This is the intergalactic slammer.
It's a jail.
This is the Borian dude.
Kind of like a dinosaur.
This is his escape chute. He's mean,
quick, and he don't take no shit.
He can shoot at the guards
with his arrow.
-Cool, huh?
-Todd.
Time for dinner.
Now.
Guess you better go in.
Hope you like the toy.
It's awesome.
Dad, Mom...
she gets weird.
Like on my birthday when you gave me
that Schwinn.
She called the bicycle store to see
if there'd been any robberies.
Tell her I don't steal
them locally, all right?
Sorry, but,
I can't take this.
You know how Mom will get.
Guess I'll see ya.
All right.
How do you like that?
-Yo, Trin, me. What's up?
-Ready to be happy?
Remember the landlady
I told you about?
The Caine woman was
her favorite tenant.
Then one day,
the tenant never comes home.
Old lady very sad. So sad she can't
throw away Amnesia Chick's shit.
It's pay dirt, Mitch.
Got an old postcard never mailed.
Woman telling everyone
she just got engaged.
Samantha's handwriting.
Perfect match.
She was engaged to some guy in Jersey.
No phone number, just an address.
Holy shit! Score!
That's worth time and a half.
Double. I made us look good.
Her other P.I.s couldn't find dick.
Course not.
Took a true dickhound like yourself.
Tell Ms. Caine
I'm coming to see her tonight.
Honey, you have an ETA
on that carrot?
Stow it.
Maybe you should just take it
with you to school.
You're killing me.
You're so funny.
Here.
Give me the knife.
No!
I'm going to cut this carrot,
and you're going to eat it and like it.
Piss off.
Hon?
Look, will you?
How the hell?
I used to do this.
I'm a chef.
Look what she's doing.
Give me something else.
Quick, anything!
-Tomato.
-Tomato.
Look.
-Look at this woman go. All right.
-More!
Pepper. Pepper!
Celery!
Look at this!
More!
Scallions!
One more tomato.
Look at this woman.
She's amazing!
Chefs do that.
Timothy, I know
you're gonna kill me.
Please use the gun,
not the knife
As a favor to me
I'm begging you.
Goddamn it, how can I tell the Feds
about the fucking "Honeymoon" thing?
I don't know
a fucking thing about it.
No, you don't.
I don't know a fucking thing.
You know, I can tell
when someone's lying to me.
What's so fucking important?
Remember your old colleague...
One-Eyed Jack?
He's doing 7-10 upstate.
Not anymore. He broke out.
Two days after seeing...
something on TV that "disturbed" him.
Yeah, "Baywatch Nights."
You want to get to the fucking point?
Under sedation, he said
Charly Baltimore's alive, sir.
Daedalus is concerned. He thought
you disposed of her eight years ago.
I know it's highly unlikely, but if she
were alive, she might be in contact...
with the old man
in Massachusetts.
Tap his phone.
Tell Daedalus I'm on my way.
Timothy, out.
I can't see Mr. Perkins.
He's there.
He's on the sled, see him?
He's watching you.
He's very excited.
That's better.
Ready to try it alone?
I want you to hold my hand.
Just pretend I am.
You can do it.
Piece of cake.
Here we go.
Ready?
-Mom, it won't work. Swear.
-Sure it will.
You're one of the X-men.
You're tough. Ready? Let go.
-3, 2, 1, go!
-Wait! I'm not ready!
Go!
Keep going!
I can't do it.
I want to go home.
I know you're afraid.
That's the whole point.
Can't you see that?
Stop being a little baby
and get up.
I can't skate anymore.
My wrist hurts.
Life is pain.
Get used to it.
You will skate
all the way to the shore, princess.
And you will not fall again.
Am I understood?
I'm just guessing, but...
this is a tree house.
I think you wanted a doghouse.
Little joke.
She said that her wrist hurt.
I didn't know it was fractured.
I don't remember...
what I said to her.
I can't remember.
No!
I'm not going to hurt you.
It's not me I'm worried about.
Evening, Charly.
Long time.
Get out!
I want my eye back, bitch!
Chefs do that.
Caitlin! Oh, my God!
We have to find Caitlin.
Slow down!
Your kid's okay.
She's in my car.
Jesus!
What the hell's going on here?
Freeze!
Don't hurt him!
Don't shoot!
Yeah, don't shoot!
Like she said!
Call an ambulance!
This man?
He's gonna...
help me find out some things.
So we'll be safe.
You understand?
When will you be back home?
Before you know it.
I swear.
Here.
I want you to keep a candle
burning in the window...
for me.
That's called "keeping a vigil."
That's to light my way home.
Here.
This is to my portable phone.
I keep it with me.
You call me anytime.
Why don't you keep this?
For luck.
Let's have Mr. Perkins wear it.
There.
See?
You do what you have to.
But, Sam...
the person you used to be...
whatever you find...
I'm not scared.
I never will be.
Not ever.
Thank you.
Mr. Perkins...
you lost one of your agents...
whose training included,
among other things...
counterassassination.
Now she turns up as belle
of the Christmas parade.
That information is two weeks old,
Mr. President.
To my knowledge...
Charlene Baltimore died...
in my employ.
Relic of the Cold War.
The kind of violent operative that has
since been eliminated from our ranks.
You recruited this woman?
For Chapter, sir.
Her father was...
a friend of mine.
Stop, I don't want
to hear that stuff.
The "intelligence" community.
You people are unbelievable.
You dump a mess like this
in my lap...
and then you come whining to me,
"Where's our funding?"
I'll tell you where it is.
Can you say, "health care"?
I'm not talking 'bout moving in
And I don't want
To change your life
But there's a warm wind
Blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight
I'm not talking 'bout the linen
-And I don't want to change your life
-"Moving in."
What?
It's, uh--
The song's not about linen.
Yeah, whatever.
So, you cold?
-Yeah, freezing.
-Turn on the heat.
It doesn't work,
but it makes a very annoying noise.
-Distracts from the cold.
-I'll pass, thanks.
Who knew I had an old fiancé?
And now we're just going
to pay a surprise visit?
There are no bells or whistles
because I don't remember any of this.
That's too bad. That's the cream
of the crop, believe me.
I forgot to ask.
Why is it that you got so far?
Say what?
Well, I mean...
you seem kind of low-rent.
No offense.
None taken.
Really, I was about to--
Shit!
Are you okay?
Is your neck all right?
You don't have whiplash?
What?
I'm just...
Since you almost ran us off the road,
I'm wondering what it is...
that you get
from an experience like that?
Don't get me wrong.
I'm sure it's enriching in some way...
and I know she was probably moved by
some asshole screaming out the window.
I didn't hang out the window and yell.
I checked out her form, okay?
If it's any consolation,
you got her beat hands down.
Really?
Yeah, from the neck up.
This is exciting.
You saw her tits.
It's so neat.
Look, it's a guy thing,
all right?
Now you got a nice body
and all...
but those, you could see them
coming around the corner.
You got time
to comb your hair. Shit.
What's that?
Charly was my name in the dream.
"To Charly.
Love, Nathan"
"Nathan J. Waldman, Ph.D."
All right, let's find a phone.
Found one.
Find his number.
-Take the stand.
-I got it. Now what'll I do with it?
Sit down!
Alice, please.
Your dog, Alice.
It and my appetite
are mutually exclusive.
-What's wrong with the dog?
-It's simple.
He's been licking his asshole
for the last three hours.
I submit that there's nothing there
worth more than an hour's attention.
And I think that whatever
he's attempting to dislodge...
is either gone for good...
or there to stay.
Wouldn't you agree?
Mr. Waldman...
I got your number from a realtor...
in Massachusetts,
and I'd just like to speak to you.
Who is this?
You tell me, Mr. Waldman.
My full name, please?
God!
It's really you.
"Chapter"...
they think you're dead.
-My full name, please!
-You don't know your name?
Your full name...
is Charlene Elizabeth Baltimore.
Don't talk, just listen.
You could be in danger, understand?
We must meet.
We must meet straightaway.
Where are you now?
In Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.
We'll meet halfway.
There's a town in New Jersey,
Chesterman.
Tomorrow.
Central train station...
at 11 a.m.
Meet me.
I'll tell you everything.
Signal Daedalus.
We got her.
-Curry Brand cat food.
-Could you spell that, please?
Curry Brand.
All this shit is the same anyway.
Yeah? You don't happen
to have a cat?
What do I need a cat for?
I got a girl.
Yeah, pussy's pussy.
-Mom, can I stay up for "Rugrats"?
-What, sweetie?
"Rugrats."
I want to stay up.
Yes, you can stay up for "Rugrats."
I'm gonna go now.
All right.
-Mommy loves you.
-I love you too.
Big kiss.
-Bye, Mommy.
-Good night.
Put my glasses in my pocket
Put the jacket on the chair
I sing the things I do,
so I won't forget.
Like...
Turning off the downstairs' light
Before I go to bed at night
Shit.
I can't take this...
fucking waiting.
Excuse me.
Do you normally curse this much?
What are you, a Mormon?
Yes, that's why I just smoked
a pack of Newports...
and drank three vodka tonics.
What I'm saying is...
back when we first met
you were all like...
"Oh, phooey!
I burned the darn muffins."
Now, you go into a bar...
ten minutes later sailors come
running out. What up with that?
Thanks for sharing.
Mind your own damn business.
While you're at it,
if you're going to smoke inside...
close the damn door.
I heard you scream--
Shit!
Henessey...
I didn't know about the gun.
I wasn't hiding things. I swear.
-Goddamn it, stop walking!
-I'm going home!
And so are you!
I paid you!
Well, here!
Take your money!
Take it!
I can't go home.
Until I know why that man tried
to kill me, I'm trapped.
It's like I'm in a goddamn prison!
Do you know how that feels?
Yeah, I know exactly
what that's like!
Four years inside.
Marion, Illinois.
A real shithole!
And I'm not going back!
Seven years ago
I was an Atlanta cop.
Me and my partner handled
a lot of impounded shit.
That motherfucker hated me.
I forget why, but he did.
On one weekend...
when he was conveniently away...
some bonds disappeared
from his office.
Lo and behold, when my brothers in blue
responded to an anonymous tip...
you'll never guess what they found
sitting in my closet.
The bonds.
Your partner put them there.
No, I did.
I stole the damn things.
I never did one thing right
in my life. You know that?
Not one.
That takes skill.
You just missed our exit.
Give me back my money.
Oh, so you're--
I'm taking you
to the train station, yes.
To meet Mr. Waldman.
Here you go.
Merry Christmas.
Bah humbug.
Look out the window.
Shut up.
You know we're about
ten minutes early.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Put my keys in my left pocket
-Gun in the right-hand side
-It makes a bulge you can see.
I should stick it in my pants
and shoot my damn dick off?
Now you're a sharpshooter?
Going to shake hands with the man
-How you doing?
-Hi.
It's for you.
Another in a long line of...
bad personal investments.
-Excuse me?
-Just saw the ring on your finger.
Do I know you from somewhere?
Back up.
Total pickup line.
Forget I said it.
I take it back.
Thank you for the beer, but...
I don't know you, no.
No, you don't.
I can tell when someone's...
lying to me.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Yours?
Who's your boyfriend?
Some guy.
Okay, people,
I got what I need.
Move in. Do them both.
That man walking this way.
Is that him?
I think so.
Gun!
Jesus wept!
Let's go!
We got to get to the car.
This way!
Come on!
Go! Go!
No! Come on!
No, this way!
Move it!
Come on, Ms. Caine!
Come on!
Oh, shit!
Take this! I got three shots left
in this revolver.
You got a full clip.
Just point...
and spray. Okay?
Ready?
And...
Fuck it!
Run for your life!
There's no way out!
-Jump!
-That's a three-story drop!
Are you crazy?
-What happened?
-I saved your ass. It was great!
We've got to get to the car!
This way.
Come on!
Get down!
Get down!
Get in, both of you!
Now!
I said now!
We jumped out of a building!
Yes, it was very exciting.
Tomorrow we go to the zoo.
You're Waldman.
No, I'm the Hill Brothers bean buyer.
Who else would I be? Hang on.
If you want me to talk
in front of him, you may be asked...
to kill him later.
It works for me. Your call.
Fire out the back if you have to.
-Old man, how many of those you got?
-Three.
One shoulder, one hip and one here...
right next to Mr. Wally.
Most patdowns never reveal it as
an agent's often reluctant to feel up...
another man's groin.
Other questions?
What's the weather like
on your planet?
Charlene, my darling.
My name is Samantha,
Samantha Caine.
No, forget all that.
The schoolteacher business...
was your cover.
Do you hear me, Charly?
Your memory was gone.
You bought your own cover.
It was a fantasy for Christ's sake!
Samantha Caine never existed.
You wrote the bloody thing!
No, it's not a fantasy.
I'm in the goddamn P.T.A.!
Then quit!
You're an assassin working
for the United States Government.
I ought to know.
I trained you.
Get the fuck out of here!
Assassin!
Your father was...
in the Royal Irish Rangers,
assigned to Belfast.
After he was murdered there
in 1975...
his friend, Perkins, adopted you,
or perhaps I should say...
recruited you,
to work for Chapter...
a blackbag operation working
from the U.S. State Department.
You getting this?
October, 1988, you were assigned...
to take out a munitions dealer
named Daedalus...
and his hired enforcer, Timothy.
You failed
to complete your mission...
electing instead to die, of all things,
despite clear orders to the contrary.
Dead you remain.
Until without preamble...
you reemerge eight years later
and a good deal frumpier.
Anyhow, I think we can
safely assume...
that Daedalus is aware
of your resurrection...
and attempting to reverse it.
He'll be watching the police, hospitals.
We must stay away, understand?
Mr. Henessey, can I help you?
Henessey, what is it?
-It's a setup. It's got to be.
-Put that down.
This is not an episode of television.
Those guys
back at the train station.
How'd they know we'd be there?
lmpossible! Unless Waldman told them.
-I did nothing of the kind.
-They tapped your phone.
I know it sounds preposterous.
Just happen to know we'd be calling?
-Get in the car.
-All right.
See here, my friend.
Oh, shit!
Get in the car, now!
How about it? You believe
any of the crap that guy said?
Well... no.
That guy was a lunatic.
We got to talk to someone else.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
I hope not because I'm thinking
how much my balls hurt.
But if you're talking
about the postcard...
I don't think I want to meet
any more of your old friends.
We have no choice.
We need some answers,
or we're gonna die.
I saw you from the road.
I think your name is Luke...
and I think
I was going to marry you.
Oh, baby!
Oh, man.
Luke.
She's my only daughter...
and I don't quite trust you yet.
So what about it?
-You and Mr. Outdoors bump pelvises?
-It's possible.
And how about your daughter?
What's her name, Cathead?
-Caitlin.
-You think he might be the father?
I don't know. But all these little
details about him are coming back.
-I'm remembering things.
-Like what?
Is this "America's Funniest
Practical Videos" or something?
Keep your fucking hands
where I can see them!
I had an itch.
Charly, this is crazy.
You and me, we were like...
Don't you remember?
Hell, you pursued me.
I know that he has a pin in his leg.
Car accident.
I know he cuts his own hair.
He doesn't own a TV.
He sits down when he pees.
That's enough.
I'm getting a boner.
I know this man.
I must have been seeing him.
Let me talk to him.
Alone.
I'm sorry.
Do you want to take a walk?
Got me a handgun
Got a rifle too
Anybody fuck with Mitch
He know just what to do
'Cause I'm a
Bad motherfucker
Stay quiet
and drop the rifle.
How'd you find us?
There may be many reasons
not to kill you...
but among them is not that
you'll be missed by NASA.
I found the address
in your coat.
Here. Between the address
of a topless bar...
and a picture of what looks
like a man's penis.
That's a duck, not a dick.
The man she's with.
Who is he?
Her former fiancé.
His name's Luke.
Former fiancé? That's ridiculous.
She was never engaged.
I just went through this with her.
She knows how the man pees.
Look at him.
He's cool.
Former fiancé.
-Why on earth would she think that?
-We found a note.
It's in her handwriting.
-She saw a note?
-Who are you, William Shatner?
Calm down.
-Yeah, a note to her uncle.
-Max?
Uncle Max!
That's the agency,
you blithering idiot!
And the word "engaged" means
she's locked on to target. Fuck!
-Not a former lover but a target?
-Her target, yes!
She knows things because she studied
the bastard to assassinate him.
Shit!
-Sam!
-Charly!
He's Daedalus!
Get out of there!
It's him!
Well, howdy there.
If it isn't the forgetful spy.
How you feeling?
You're the man from the bar.
Will you look at her.
She's not faking it.
She doesn't know me from Adam.
It's not that I don't trust
my compadre here, Major Baltimore.
In fact, I had every confidence
that your amnesia was genuine.
Until you showed up here.
You follow?
I'm trying to pull off
the biggest job of my career...
so, darling,
I have to know...
how much about me
you really remember.
And who you've told.
I haven't told a soul.
I swear.
We'll soon know.
What is this?
Some kind of torture thing?
Torture, yes.
A woman's face never looks...
quite so beautiful
as when it's distended in pain.
Witness...
the beauty of childbirth.
Untie me,
and I'll make any face you want.
Let's not and say we did.
Take a deep breath.
We're gonna do the torture thing.
Operation Honeymoon
is on schedule.
I've secured the tanker.
Now I just got to make the soup.
I'll follow as soon as
I'm done here.
Ten minutes in this cold water,
she'll be insane or dead.
Five minutes.
She'll tell me everything I need.
That's right.
Take in all the air you can.
If you need to vomit,
do it now.
So you...
don't remember anything...
at all?
Best night of your fucking life.
I say drown the wench.
Talk to me, Major.
Is my identity safe?
My name is Samantha Caine.
Answer the question.
Who knows about me?
Nobody!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
I hate to see you like this, Charly.
I heard you were
a hell of a spy once.
Watch your back.
I'm not done yet.
Goodnight.
Okay, I'll signal Daedalus.
Your money will be waiting.
Jack...
do yourself a favor, man.
Don't let her looks fool you.
She's the fucking Energizer Bunny.
Just do her and dump her.
Don't get cute and play doctor first.
I made that mistake.
Nearly killed me.
Little fucker.
Daedalus...
I'll make you a deal.
Let me go now...
and I'll leave you
the use of your legs.
Why have you resurfaced?
Is it Operation Honeymoon?
Is that it?
Who sent you?
Why are you here?
I let you touch me, cowboy.
I think I need a bath.
Samantha, please.
Who's Samantha?
Where's Henessey?
Hey, Mitch!
You're awake.
You're seeping.
Here...
Iook at this.
Oh, shit!
That hurt like shit.
I know.
That's why I distracted you first.
Same principle
as deflowering virgins.
What?
Virgins? What?
I read it in this Harold Robbins' book.
The guy bites her on the ear.
Distracts from the pain.
Ever try that?
No, I sock them in the jaw and yell,
"Pop goes the weasel."
Who the fuck are you?
Name's Charly, the spy.
Nice to meet you.
Drink?
As you can see, things are still crazy,
but the sheriff has told me this:
There have been gunshots--
Okay, let's say I buy it.
You are a trained killer.
I can't even say that
with a straight face.
So, Samantha, she...
Never really existed.
Like Nathan said.
She was a total fabrication.
I made her up.
So now she's just gone?
-Forever and ever?
-Thank God!
Look at my inordinately large ass.
Look what she did to me.
Pretty convincing act.
I guess.
You know...
her personality had to come
from somewhere.
Change the subject.
Better yet.
Bring me that bottle.
Here you go.
Drink up.
So what's next?
-What do we do now?
-I contact Chapter.
I come in for debriefing.
Bury the last eight years.
Get back to work.
Cheers!
Would you believe it, Harry?
We got an appropriations review
in three weeks...
and now the President wants to know
how I managed to lose an agent.
Yes, sir, you have a call
on line three, sir.
You going to tell me who it is?
Charly Baltimore, sir.
Run a trace.
This is Mr. Perkins.
Turn on the TV.
Farm in New Jersey. Seven dead.
Good Lord, girl, we've been
looking all over for you.
I got a photo of you
in a Christmas parade.
What the hell is happening?
Don't be stupid.
I completed my assignment.
You mean Daedalus?
I shot him.
He's pretty much dead.
Actually I would have
done it earlier, say in '92...
but I was baking.
Don't ask.
I want to come in.
Sure.
Of course.
Let me direct you
to a safe house.
Forget it.
We play it my way.
You want me back, then you stay away.
I'll call you.
Those are the rules, understand?
Shit!
Did you hear that?
If she got to Daedalus...
she could know
about Honeymoon.
She might know that old targets
are now your new best friends.
That could be trouble.
Goddamn you.
There were weapons on that farm.
She's armed.
Stop having kittens.
You're the head of a major spy network,
and you have a tendency to whine.
She could compromise
this entire operation.
We have 24 hours.
We find her...
and we kill her.
Do whatever it takes
but be careful.
If it gets out
you're working for me...
I'll be grabbing my ankles
on the White House lawn.
The lady's wacked. She's lost it.
I gotta get out of here.
I need you to meet me.
I'll sneak out to this phone and
call you at midnight with the details.
All right, Sam,
what did that accomplish?
I'm testing our boy Perkins.
Got a light?
I don't really trust him.
Come again?
Little experiment.
If he was looking for me
in Pennsylvania, he tapped your office.
You mean
he just traced that call?
Come midnight,
you hang by the phone.
If he wants to erase me...
he'll send someone to kidnap
and torture you for my whereabouts.
In which case, hey,
I don't trust him.
No. Time out.
I haven't had a date
in eight years, Mitch.
Is this a fun date?
