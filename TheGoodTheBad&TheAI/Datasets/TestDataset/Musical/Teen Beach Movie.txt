'Cause for me,
it's a dream come true.
I think about you,
boy, day and night.
If this is wrong, I
don't care if I'm right.
'Cause I know one
thing's for certain.
It could be forever
and ever and ever.
It could be forever
and ever and ever.
Best day ever!
Yeah, it was pretty awesome, huh?
Awesome? Surfing all
day, us being together.
Awesome wishes it was this awesome.
- Yeah, it was perfect.
- Yeah, it was.
Um, listen, Brady...
Ooh, did you hear about tomorrow?
Yeah. Can you believe they're
talking about 40-foot waves?
There's a huge storm
coming up from the north.
Surf like that only happens
here once every 30 years.
Can you imagine dropping
in on a barrel that huge?
Summer's not over yet! Woo!
Come on, I'm starving.
Race you to the house.
- Boy: I clearly won.
- Yeah, yeah.
First thing tomorrow, we hit
the beach and that awesome surf.
Brady, about tomorrow.
- Whoa, wait. Hear that?
-
No way!
- Hey!
- Hey. What's up, bro?
I can't believe you're
watching this without me.
Now that you're here, I'm not.
Please tell me this isn't...
Both: Wet Side Story...
Yeah, that.
Ah, 1962, surfers, bikers.
Best movie ever made.
How can you two like this silliness?
Especially you, grandpa.
Silliness? Mack, my dear, this
movie defined an entire culture.
- Exactly.
- Yeah.
A surfer guy and a biker
girl share a secret love,
while trying to unite
the rivaling gangs.
As an evil real estate mogul tries
to turn their hangout into a resort,
by building a weather machine which
blows up, creating a massive storm.
Silliness? Really?
Well, can we watch it later,
because I really need to talk to you.
Just watch my favorite part
when the two leads' eyes meet,
and they're pulled apart
by their rivaling gangs.
Don't usually swoon,
but I'm over the moon.
This is my favorite part right here.
Hey, get your salty surfer
mitts off my baby sister.
Get your biker baby sister
off our boarding buddy.
Oh, yeah?
Come on. They sing for no reason.
They come out of the water,
and their hair is totally dry.
The girls never surf as well as the
boys, and they sing for no reason.
I had to mention that one again, because
even a second time, I don't get why.
But it's always summer, and
everyone just sings and surfs.
But really, the surfing looks
fake. They'd drown on a real wave.
Seriously, they sing in the
ocean, and never spit out water.
Surprise.
Well, aren't you going to give
your Aunt Antoinette a hug?
Well, you are so...
Grown up. You look
absolutely unacceptable.
- What?
- Not you, dear.
Tell him the offer is unacceptable.
It's good to see you, McKenzie.
What are you doing here? I
thought you were coming tomorrow.
Well, you thought wrong.
We are leaving tomorrow.
I hope you've packed.
Mack, what does she
mean by leaving tomorrow?
Uh, this is Brady.
Brady, I am McKenzie's Aunt.
I'm sure she's told you all about me.
Mack, what does she
mean by leaving tomorrow?
Antoinette, welcome home.
Oh, hello, father.
You know it's always good to have...
Have you back.
Oh...
I see you're still making surfboards.
Oh, don't tell me.
You still have that.
Mack: Still have it?
We all grew up with the
legends about this board.
It's part of the family.
Me, your grandfather, and his father,
we each found our destiny on it.
There is only one way to
"find" your destiny, McKenzie.
And that is to...
Work hard for it.
Okay. All right, Mack. What does
she mean by leaving tomorrow?
Brady, as of tomorrow, my niece
will be attending the exclusive...
Overpriced, and did I mention
exclusive, Dunwich Preparatory Academy.
What?
Back east.
Uh, Antoinette, we should
talk about this, please.
There is nothing to talk about.
This has always been the deal.
Isn't that right, McKenzie?
Sure.
It's just that, um...
Tomorrow there are these extreme conditions
I've been waiting my entire life to surf...
Surf?
Oh, sweetheart.
Your new life begins tomorrow.
Your endless summer has...
Come to an end.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
You don't understand how
hard I tried. I just...
I didn't know how.
You're leaving? Just like that?
Why are they making you do this?
They're not making me. It's my choice.
So change your mind.
There's not enough time. My
flight leaves at noon tomorrow.
How can you leave? This is your
home. It's where your grandfather is.
It's where you surf, it's where I am.
I was really lucky to get
into this school, Brady.
My Aunt said it will
pave the way to my future.
I know you're upset, and I
should've told you. I just...
I didn't know how.
Mack! Hey.
Stop!
What was this deal your
Aunt was talking about?
After we lost my mom, the
deal I made with my Aunt was
that I could stay here with my grandfather
for the first part of high school.
Then, when it was time to get
serious, I would leave with my Aunt
and go to this school, like she did.
So she just shows up to take you away?
Aren't you happy here?
This is my mom's journal.
"Most of all, I dream that my
daughter becomes a great success.
"That she isn't just
pulled through life...
"But marches through it...
"Triumphantly".
She sounds amazing.
Yeah.
My mom wanted to go to college,
and make something of herself but,
she had me, time passed, and...
She never got to live out that dream.
- That's not your fault.
- No, I know it's not.
I also know that I can do
what she never had a chance to.
You don't have to be who your Aunt is.
Mack, you can be anything you want.
Brady, I have to do this.
- What about us?
- How can there be an us after today?
I'll wait for you.
I know what it feels like
to miss someone, Brady.
And I care about you too much
to ever put you through that.
So you're saying you care about
me enough to break up with me?
I don't want to, Brady,
but what choice do I have?
Thanks...
For the most awesome summer of my life.
I wish it wasn't over.
What's up?
How did you know I was gonna be here?
I knew you couldn't stay
away from surf like this.
Brady, I'm glad you
came, but... I told you...
I just came to watch
you surf, not to propose.
Okay. Check out what I'm about to do.
Hey, bro.
You gotta see this. She's rippin' it.
Yeah.
I don't like the looks
of this sky, Brady.
Yeah, check it out.
You're right. That doesn't look good.
She's gotta get in. This looks bad.
What is she doing?
She's not paddling in.
This isn't good.
Mack! Come on. Don't do it.
- No, I have to.
- Don't do it.
Mack!
You okay?
What are you doing here?
Okay, what happened to the storm?
Come on, let's get your board.
Let's go.
Mack: What did you do?
I tried to save you.
This is the part where
you tell me I'm your hero,
and then, you shower me with kisses.
I didn't need saving.
This is my last chance to ride that
monster wave before I leave forever,
and instead, I end up here and...
Brady.
Yeah?
Brady.
- Yeah?
-  What a day.
Maybe we're dead.
We've died and ended up in a musical!
I can see my reflection
in my surfboard shine.
I can hardly wait
to cause a commotion.
Come on, everyone,
jump into the ocean.
No ands, ifs, buts,
we're nuts for the beach.
-  Surf, surf crazy.
-  Surf, surf crazy.
Grab the perfect
wave, say hi to the sky.
We'll soak up the sun
and get the ultimate tan.
We can hardly wait
to show our devotion.
No rules at all,
have a ball at the beach.
Ride the perfect
wave, say hi to the sky.
Surf, sun and sand,
it's a bikini wonderland.
Mack, we're in the movie.
What movie?
My movie. Wet Side Story...
What?! How? Why?
All viable questions.
What do we do?
Have fun! Woo!
Burgers hot, water
warm, a cool seaside bash.
Make a splash!
Crazy!
- I'm Tanner.
- Seacat.
- Giggles.
- Rascal.
- Kiki.
- Brady.
I'm Mack.
-  Surf, surf.
- Woo!
Ride the perfect
wave, say hi to the sky.
Surf, sun, sand,
it's a bikini wonderland.
Well, that happened.
It's fantastic! Crazy, right?
- I'd say so.
-
Oh, that was awesome!
I mean...
Insane.
Um... what up, dawg?
Far out. He thinks we're animals.
No, it's an expression. It means...
He's right,
it does sound ridiculous.
And where are you cats from?
So cats is okay, but dogs is weird.
- Just follow my lead.
- Is it leading us home?
We're from, uh...
- Not far away.
- Far away.
- Far away.
- Not far away.
Right, not far, but, um...
But, but... far.
Close... far.
Hey, Rascal.
Yeah, Seacat?
Seems to me that we've
got some unwanted hodads...
Hodads!
- That we need to put the kibosh...
- Kibosh!
No, no, you've got it all wrong.
- We don't jelly...
- Jelly!
Roll to outsiders.
This is Big Momma's, the restaurant
where the surfers and bikers all hang.
Bikers? What bikers?
Each gang wants the other one gone so
the others can have it for themselves.
Here comes Butchy, the leader of
the motorcycle gang, The Rodents.
- The Rodents?!
-
How cool is that?
So we landed in the middle
of a surf and turf war?
- Soifers.
-
Thought I smelled something fishy.
Rodents. I knew I
shoulda laid some traps.
Thought you were exterminated.
And I thought you
soifers was all washed up.
Yeah, because clearly, youse is drips.
You should make like the
ocean and wave good-bye.
Because Butchy wants
this place to himself.
Yeah, Butchy wants this
place all to himself.
Yeah, Butchy wants...
Ooh.
They does not lie.
Sorry, but Big Momma's
is a perfect hangout.
We want it all to ourselves...
I'm so very sorry, but that
might not probably happen.
Excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me.
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.
What?
I'll show you what.
Stand back.
Why?
You'll see.
We're keeping it
cool, smooth and steady.
Slicked-back hair, man,
things are getting heavy.
We do anything we want,
anytime we want, oh, yeah.
Bubble gum, cherry
pop, go to the hop.
Hangin' with my brother
because his friends are so hot.
-  For some bruisin'.
- All right.
I went to the
drive-in, what did I see.
A hundred little
betties all starin' at me.
I got these two
wheels and an open road.
Just pop that
clutch, I'm ready to go.
We do anything we want,
anytime we want, oh, yeah.
Oh, no, we're not
gonna live any other way.
I got a gang full of
bruisers all cruisin' with me.
We do anything we want
anytime we want, oh, yeah.
We do anything we want
anytime we want, oh, yeah.
No, we're not gonna
live any other way.
Oh, no, we're not
gonna live any other way.
Woo!
Oh.
You just couldn't help
yourself, could you?
I've always wanted to be in that number.
Remember that movie with the robot who
drank liquid from an abandoned spaceship,
turned into a Vampire middle school
teacher who taught the entire school
to salsa dance, and then went on
to win the regional championships?
- Yeah.
- That makes more sense than this.
I have an idea. Hand me my cell.
- What year was this movie made?
- Uh, around 1960, and...
And you're gonna do what with a
cell phone that doesn't exist yet?
Call my folks... who
weren't born yet, right.
Brady, my entire future depends on
us getting out of here, like, now!
Except maybe it would
be fun to hang for a bit.
Except no, it wouldn't, because I
have to catch a plane in two hours.
Well, two hours and 50 years.
Fine. Maybe we need to figure out how we
got here in order to know how to leave.
So we came in on that storm, right?
Maybe that has something to do with it.
So we have to wait for a
storm to get out of here?
Yeah, but we're in luck, because there's
a huge storm at the end of the movie.
Okay.
What are we gonna do in the meantime?
All: Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey... oh!
Oh, hey, we're having a shredder
shindig tonight here at Big Momma's.
You should both make the scene.
- Yeah, but...
- Sounds blastin'!
- Yeah!
- Hey, cowabunga! Woo!
Radical! Woo!
We're stuck in another dimension, and your
idea of a good use of time is to party?!
Well, not me.
This was... how am I wearing...
Where did these outfits come from?
From the magic of movies.
You look nice. Dude, your board.
What? How did that get here?
Come on, let's go.
Hey, Giggles, those hips are so seismic.
It ain't moving 'em
that's the problem, Seacat.
It's getting 'em to stop.
So this is a shindig.
Yep.
And you're dressed for it. Let's roll.
So, boss, how we gonna get Big
Momma's to be only a biker joint?
Shut up, I'm thinking.
How long is that gonna take?
Great, now I gots two
things to think about.
Let's go.
We's not gonna let a bunch of waterlogged
wash-outs spoil our very fine evening.
Big Momma's is like a second home
to me... if I had a first one.
I popped my first wheelie in here.
Hey, did you see that
surfer dude eyeballin' you?
Yeah, I saw him. I saw him, all right.
- Sodas for everyone.
- Thanks, sis.
Those surfers weren't
bothering you, were they?
No, of course not.
They're not so, bad.
All surfers is bad.
Yeah, all surfers is bad.
Except for the ones that are very bad.
They're even worse.
Ooh, it's almost time.
Let's go, let's go.
Hey, Big Momma, you sure know
how to fry up a fish burger.
If you can catch it,
Big Momma can cook it!
Ooh, shake a tail feather.
Ha ha ha!
Oh, boy, I gotta cook.
- Come on, let's dance.
- No.
I'm sorry.
Don't usually swoon,
but I'm over the moon.
'Cause he was just
too cool for school.
And now I'm fallin'
for him, fallin' for him.
Feels like I tumbled
from another world.
Maybe I'll stumble,
but I know for sure.
Head over heels,
I'm gonna be your girl.
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm sorry, but I'm worried.
I don't have time to
wait around for the storm.
I'm gonna head back to the beach
and try and figure a way out of here.
No, Mack, remember?
This is the part of the movie
we saw at your grandfather's,
where the two leads get together.
You enjoy it. I'll let you
know if I come up with anything.
Whoa, whoa!
You saved my life.
Not really.
The stage is, like, two feet up. The
worst you would've done is broken a nail.
I guess I literally fell for you, huh?
I'm Lela.
I know.
I mean...
Yeah, you are. I mean...
I've dreamed about this since
I was, like, in fifth grade.
Who are you?
Brady, Knight in shining board shorts.
That's a really long last name.
Nice of you to drop in.
Um, sorry. I didn't see you.
Now that you do, do
you like what you see?
Sure.
It's really nice to meet you.
Excuse me for just one second.
Brady, can I have a moment? A
really quick, important moment.
Excuse me, Lela.
Okay.
It was really great falling into you.
I hope we can do it again sometime.
The mannequin with six rows
of teeth just asked me out.
Mack, something's not right.
We could write a list of
things that aren't right,
starting with the fact that there
are enough things to write a list.
Look around.
Nothing's happening. It's almost...
It's almost dull.
Okay. And?
Okay, so when Lela sings that song about
finding the perfect boy and being happy...
See, that's exactly my point.
- Why does she need a boy to be happy?
- Because it's 1962.
The thing is, after she sings that song,
it's Tanner who's supposed to
catch her as he's walking by.
Okay, what happens right
after he catches her?
They fall instantly in love, but are pulled
apart, and a full-on dance war breaks out.
It's almost like nobody
knows exactly what to do next.
Lela and Tanner were supposed
to fall into each other's arms,
find love, and then are
pulled apart by a turf war.
That's how the movie's written?
But instead, they fell into our
arms, and now, they're into us.
- And there's no turf war.
- Right.
So we changed the movie.
- We changed the movie.
- We changed the movie!
- Yeah.
- Do you think it will affect anything?
It affected who they fell for. Who
knows what else it could affect.
Okay, okay...
Brady, you said that
there's a storm at the end
of the movie that we
can ride out of here on.
Yeah, three days after they meet.
I'm gonna ask you something,
even though I know and,
I know you know, I don't wanna know.
Is there anything that happens
in the next three days that could,
somehow affect that storm?
See. Didn't wanna know.
If you're looking for this to make
sense, you're on the wrong beach.
I'm looking to see if Les Camembert is
building his diabolical weather machine.
How often do you hear that sentence?
Remember, I told you about the
maniacal real estate developer?
Or that one.
Les Camembert knows this beachfront
property will be gold someday.
So he tells Big Momma to sell it to him
so he can build an overpriced resort.
She says no.
Of course she does,
or there'd be no movie.
- It gets better.
- I can't wait.
Let's just stop right here.
No way. It's the Camembert hideout.
Let's go. Come on.
This is it.
How do we get in?
Boom.
Les: You know, I've dreamed of a scheme
like this every since I was a mere lad,
conning my school fellows
out of their lunch money.
Lunch? How about takeout?
That's him.
He's all British and proper,
but he's from Pittsburgh.
- Who's that with him?
-
What are they building?
Desperate to get Big Momma's, Les
Camembert hires a mad scientist,
Dr. Fusion, to carry
out his diabolical idea.
Come on, come on.
What is that?
Les Camembert's diabolical
weather altering machine.
Yes, yes, yes.
Manual...
This thing's almost built.
Shouldn't you be off book?
This machine will so drastically
change the weather patterns,
it will literally still the
oceans so there's no longer surf.
It'll create humidity so dense,
it'll rust every piece off of
those shiny chrome machines.
The surfers will leave to
find a new spot to surf,
the bikers won't come near this
area ever again, and I shall triumph.
Triumph, I say!
You will have the last laugh.
Yes. I've always been rather
wary of the last laugh.
What if it was only moderately funny?
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.
Ha ha.
- Ha ha...
- Hah!
And this thing never won an Oscar.
Mack. Wait, wait.
In the movie, Lela and
Tanner discover Les' plan.
They unite the surfers and bikers,
and destroy the machine,
which ends in an explosion.
That's what creates the storm.
So if Lela and Tanner
don't get back together,
which would put the movie back on track
the way it's supposed to play out...
The chain of events that
create that storm won't happen.
And we'll be stuck
here and never get home.
Don't worry.
We'll figure it out.
Butchy, it's cold. Give me your jacket.
Oh, thanks again,
Brady, for catching me.
You know, these are...
Oh, bunkers. Are you two together?
I would never take another girl's boy.
I mean that would be stealing,
and probably very hard to return.
Uh, no, we're not together.
I mean, we're together,
but we're not... together.
Lela, this is McKenzie.
So you wouldn't mind if Brady
took me for a walk on the beach?
No.
Please. Beaches are
meant to be walked on.
That's why they're called... beaches.
You guys are strange.
I like that.
Um, meet me by the water, Brady.
Oh, it is very nice to meet you.
I don't get it.
Okay, first, you break up with me,
but then, you throw me in
the arms of someone else?
She's crushing on you.
I like you.
And until you go off to that school,
I'm not gonna like anyone else but you.
The way I like you.
You're not seeing what's
right in front of you.
You're right in front of me.
I can explain it to you, Brady,
but I can't understand it for you.
So the way to get her to like him,
is for me to deflect her
affections off of me and on to him.
I really hope so.
I'm gonna do the same with Tanner.
All right.
I'll be back as soon as I can
get that smokin' girl to hate me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Um, do you mind if I join you?
Of course not. I'd wanna join me, too.
So, hey, I've never seen
a chick quite like you.
Chick? Really?
Hold on while I lay some eggs.
Okay.
No, that was, um...
Never mind. Thank you
for the compliment.
It's nice.
Sure.
So, Lela, how come you bikers
don't get along with the surfers?
Well, it's always been like that.
We're not supposed to
have a lot in common.
Plus, we both want Big Momma's.
Some of them seem pretty cool,
like, um, that guy Tanner.
It was very courageous of you to charge
the stage like that, and save my life.
Courageous? No, no, no.
Maybe.
I mean, I'm sure anyone
would've done the same.
Even a surfer.
You're my hero.
Hero?
I mean...
Listen, Lela...
It's amazing spending time
with you, but it's not...
I'm not what you think.
So you play the guitar.
I know.
No, I mean...
Are you good?
I feel a little tired, but...
At playing guitar.
Well, sure, when something inspires me.
"If music be the food of love, play on".
Was that Shakespeare?
Huh? No, that was me.
Sometimes I talk low for effect.
Oh, well, it works.
Thanks. I can do...
High...
Also, but chicks really dig low better.
Yeah.
You know, I dig you, Mack.
You're different than
other girls around here.
Actually, no. I'm not
different. I'm totally the same.
The same as what?
As everyone that isn't different.
You mind if I write a song for you?
Uh, yes.
What word rhymes with Mack?
Smack? That's a terrible song.
Really, Tanner, you
only like me because you,
think that running into
you was destiny, but...
Not our destiny, your destiny, with someone
that you're meant to be with that isn't me.
See?
Oh, good. A song anyway.
When it's meant to
be, you go kinda crazy.
But it's meant to
be, it's destiny calling.
Maybe you've already met
the one you'll never forget.
When it's meant to be,
the stars seem to glisten.
When it's meant to be,
that's destiny calling.
And if you listen,
you'll find your heart.
Four eyes meet,
and the meet is sweet.
What's the deal
when the way you feel.
- Oh!
- Gee.
- Um...
- Plan B?
When it's meant to
be, it's destiny calling.
Thinkin' that didn't
go as well as we hoped.
Oh, no. It's your favorite
movie. What do we do?
Uh, in the movie...
The next thing to happen is...
The biker girls all have a pajama party,
and the surfer guys
all hang at Big Momma's.
Maybe we need to get ourselves invited.
All right, so I'll go this
way, you go that way. Cool?
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.
My bad. It's my favorite
movie; I should know.
Brady, Lela!
You know what I have never done?
Eaten a rock, kissed a squirrel.
All exciting things, but no.
I've never had a pajama party.
We do them all the time.
We're having one tonight.
- You don't say.
- Sure, I do. I just did.
Tanner, what are you guys doing later?
Hangin' at Big Momma's. Wanna come?
- Sure.
- Cool.
Girls tend to over complicate things.
Hey, Lela, you should totally
invite Mack to your sleepover.
Oh, great idea. How about it, Mack?
I wouldn't miss it.
- Brady.
- Whoa. You saw that, right?
If you did.
What's going on?
Well, Rash Guards
didn't exist then, right?
So it doesn't belong
here, and it disappeared.
Wait, we didn't belong here either,
so what's gonna happen to us?
- No! No music. Brady.
-
We have to get out of here.
I have to get on a plane.
- It's not me.
-
- No, no, this is not a song!
-
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying something new.
- You always have it the same.
- No.
Come on. One time.
Just keep teasin', Struts.
Jiminy jeeps, Chee Chee. How
high do you want me to go?
Until your ears pop.
Okay, but you better steer
clear of ceiling fans.
And this time, make it even.
Last time, I kept tippin' over.
What do you think?
- Oh, my gosh.
- Okay.
It's beautiful.
Should I wear this to go see Brady?
He loves to surf, and the water's
blue, and this dress is blue...
So the next time he goes surfing, he'll
see the blue water, and he'll think of me.
Oh, my gosh, I love it.
Why should a boy influence
what you choose to wear?
Or anything you do?
Simple. A girl will look at your dress,
a boy will look at how
you look in your dress.
What's the matter with lettin'
a boy be in control of things?
It's your life.
You can decide what to do.
I decide to let boys decide.
To ask us out.
- Why don't you just ask them out?
-
Has the spark come off your plugs?
Yeah, we don't ask anyone out.
We can do anything a guy can do.
I don't know where you're
from, but around here,
you have to ask a boy
out without asking him.
You know.
Like, with your eyes.
What's up?
It's wigged out. I keep missing.
- What are you trying to do?
- It's this game I play.
Where I shoot stuff, and I
try to hit that angry bird.
Wait a minute, angry...
Ha.
So all you guys do around
here is hang, eat and surf?
Is there any other way?
Sounds perfect.
Sure are some boo-ha beauties
around here, like that girl Lela.
The rodent?
We don't date no rats.
You wouldn't take out a girl
just because she's a biker?
The tide wouldn't take out a
girl just because she's a biker.
Don't listen to those guys.
Doesn't matter if a girl's a
surfer or a biker, or a bookworm.
What do you like?
Well, a girl's gotta have
something special, ya know?
Take the lead, she likes
it when you're in control.
Let her breathe, chill
out, and go with the flow.
Make all the plans,
don't be impolite.
A quick glance, bat
your eyes and look away.
Take a chance, why
not ask him on a date.
Pick up the check,
no, bake him a pie.
I know what girls
like, you know what I mean.
I know what boys like,
boys like girls like me.
I know what girls like,
girls like boys like me.
I know what boys like,
boys like girls like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
-  You got it wrong.
-  No, I got it right.
Stretch pants, cute
sweater and sweet perfume.
-  I keep it loose.
-  My outfit is tight.
I know what girls
like, you know what I mean.
I know what boys like,
boys like girls like me.
I know what girls like,
girls like boys like me.
I know what boys like,
boys like girls like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
The more they chase
me, the more I resist.
There's only one
girl that's on my list.
I know what girls like,
girls like boys like me.
I know what boys like,
boys like girls like me.
I know what girls like,
girls like boys like me.
I know what boys like,
boys like girls like me.
I know what girls like,
girls like boys like me.
I know what boys like,
boys like girls like me.
I know what girls like,
girls like boys like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
- Like me.
What's up, Elvis?
Hey, frat boy. How'd last night go?
So cool being one of those
guys, even for a night, ya know?
They look out for each other.
Well, I couldn't get
Lela to talk about Tanner.
I don't think we're any
closer than we were before.
Not really, no.
What if we can't get them together?
We could be stuck here forever.
- Would it be so bad?
- Yes.
Every minute that I'm here,
is another minute that I'm
not doing what my mom wanted.
Every minute that we're
here, we're together.
I know but...
Besides, when will we get
another chance to be in a movie?
Like, actually in a movie?
Come on, Mack.
What's your hurry to grow up and leave?
Everyone's counting on me to.
Do you really want to?
- I thought you understood.
- I do.
Then help me get home.
Fine.
Maybe we just need to get
Lela and Tanner to spend
more time with each other
without peer pressure.
Right, so they get to know each
other as people, and not just rivals.
Yeah.
How are we gonna do that?
I don't know, but I'm not gonna
stop until I figure it out.
Seacat, look!
Hey!
Whoa ho, Wahini!
Cowabunga!
Cowabunga.
I've never been beaten on the waves
before, especially not by a girl.
I think that girls can
do anything guys can do.
If I was gonna think
something right now, I think...
I think that people
aren't always what I think.
Does that go for bikers, too?
The truth is, bikers aren't that bad.
They want the same thing we want.
We just want it better.
So why all the conflict between you?
I don't know.
It's sort of what everyone expects.
Like, it's the way it's
always been, I guess.
It's, like, your heart's
telling you one thing but...
You feel like you have
to do something else.
Yeah. I feel like, it's just the "something
else" that always gets in the way.
You're a pretty smart guy.
Yeah, but more pretty.
I know this electronic stuff
can be really complicated.
Oh, come here.
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.
- Uh...
- Sit.
- Really, Lela, it's fine.
- No, we're just gonna try it.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm just... homesick.
Oh, no, is it the decor?
Oh, no, no, I'm not sick
of your home, I'm just...
How are things with you and Brady?
Good.
I guess.
How are things with you and Tanner?
Good, I guess.
You know, sometimes...
I think that boys don't
tell us what they're thinking
just because telling us
would involve more thinking.
But they make up for it by being cute...
And boys.
Hey, that's a really pretty necklace.
It's Hawaiian.
It means friendship forever.
Like us now.
You're not at all what
I thought you'd be.
Yeah.
I'm not as much like me as people think.
You know, it's funny. I feel
like I could tell you anything.
Yeah, I know, it does
feel like that, doesn't it?
I have a secret I've never told anybody.
Well, you can tell me if you want.
I mean, friendship forever, right?
Okay. Okay.
- Ready?
- Mm hmm.
I wanna surf.
Surf?
Cool.
I mean, like a pro. It's
absolutely insane, I know.
And if my brother ever found
out, he would blow a gasket.
Plus, no girls ever surfed like a boy
before, I mean, until you, but that's...
That's what I wanna do.
It's crazy, huh?
Lela.
Never let anyone tell you what
you can and can't do in life.
But...
How do I do that?
It's not always easy, believe me, but...
So...
You think I should surf?
You definitely should surf.
Know what? Brady would even teach you.
I mean, he taught me everything I know,
and I'm a pretty great surfer, right?
You really think he would do that?
Yeah. It's a perfect
plan. I'll set it up.
- Okay! Woo!
- Okay.
Hey, Tanner, so you
know what I would love?
A walk on the beach in that direction.
Now. As in, the walk
in that direction now.
Uh...
I made this for you.
You made that for me? Really?
There are like, over
indigenous to this
region which would look...
So rad on a foxy babe like you.
Thanks.
That's beautiful.
So, how about that walk?
Is it ready to be tested, Doctor?
Momentarily.
This machine will create enough humidity
to cause excessive precipitation.
Inducing torrential rains.
As well as lots of frizzy
hair and stinky pits.
Good. The more "hoomidity," the better.
- Humidity.
- Hmm?
- Hu.
- Hmm?
- Hu.
- Hmm?
- Hu.
- What about me?
- Not hoo, hu.
- Me what?
- You said hoo.
- No, you said hu.
No, it's not hu, it's hoo.
Yes, I know it's me. Why
would I not know who I am?
Now, we just flip this switch.
Ha!
There, that's better. It
was getting dark in here.
Now, we just flip this
switch, ever so delicately...
To protect the intricate inner
workings of the machine, and...
What?
Uh, Tanner! Hi.
Um, so I gotta go talk to Brady, but
how about we meet in a few minutes?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Bye.
Bravo.
You're a wizard of weather.
A jet stream genius rising to the
occasion under intense barometric pressure.
- Oh, go on.
- Your mother must be so proud.
I'm just like her, you
know. I even have her eyes.
Of course, I let her
keep the rest of her face.
We've only got one mother.
So, now that we've temporarily
caused these changes in the weather,
how do we make them permanent so we can get
rid of these bikers and surfers for good?
We need to magnify the power.
Plutonium?
Lime soda.
- Strawberry soda?
- Plutonium.
In two hours' time...
This liquid will turn green,
and reach a boiling
point of 647 degrees.
Or as we scientists like
to call it, wow, that's hot!
Ha!
All right, meanwhile, let's go see
the effect it's had on the water.
- After you.
- After you.
- No, after you.
- No, after you.
Brady, did you see that?
Yeah, and it's the final
warning before the big storm.
Les' plan is working.
Okay. Okay, we need to get back into
the lighthouse to try and stop him.
But we need the element of surprise.
Do you think we can get
into it from the water?
-
- Mack.
Mack, you okay?
- Hair.
- Hair?
Hair, hair!
- Your hair isn't wet.
- Hair isn't wet.
- What does that mean?
- It means that my hair isn't wet.
- And that means?
- We're morphing.
Changing, Brady. We're
morphing into the movie.
- We're changing?
- We're changing.
You're singing.
Why are you singing?
Broke into song.
We're part of an
involuntary musical number.
- Stop.
-  I can't stop.
- Stop!
-  I can't stop.
This isn't good. First,
the Rash Guard vanishes.
Then your hair.
Now this.
-  Don't tell me it's a song.
- It's a song.
Can't you see that
this has gone too far?
Just close your eyes
if you don't wanna see.
An inefficient way
to move the story along.
Someone, won't you
make it, make it stop?
Don't make it stop.
-  Talk, talk.
-  Talk, talk.
-  Talk.
-  Talk.
Talk, talk, talk, talk,
talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
Stop!
Okay, okay, has it stopped?
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.
Let's go find Lela and Tanner.
- All right.
- Come on!
- Oh, hey.
- Oh.
- Are you waiting for Mack?
- Yeah.
- You waiting for Brady?
- Yeah.
All right.
So, we gotta get Lela
and Tanner together.
We have to make them find
out about Les' machine,
and have them destroy it
before it destroys them.
Oh, no! We're talking in plot points.
Going somewhere?
Let's go.
You're not going anywhere.
I know karate.
And, like, two other Japanese words.
- Brady!
- Ah!
Brady!
Oh!
Brady!
Brady? Brady!
Oh, he's fine. It was only on stun.
Drat.
Ow.
In the movie, that looked like
it would hurt a whole lot less.
Yeah.
We're gonna surf.
- What? You like to surf?
- I know.
It's like riding a cloud,
except the cloud is water.
No way! I said the same
thing, except not right now.
I know that bikers aren't supposed
to like surfing, but I don't care.
Oh, my gosh.
- I don't care.
- You don't?
- Hey, you know what?
- No, I don't know that either.
I've always wanted to ride a motorcycle.
- Are you serious?
- No, I'm Tanner.
I grew up riding.
Is that why you're stunning
as a moon, lighteth up a day.
Who said that?
I just did.
Wow. I really like your low voice.
Thanks.
- I can do high, too.
- Yeah.
You know, who would've thought that a biker
and a surfer could have so much in common?
- Both: Not me.
- Both: Stop.
- Both: Okay, I'll stop.
- Both: Okay, I'll stop.
Did you ever think that maybe...
The person you thought was perfect
for you isn't as perfect for you as,
the perfect person for you?
You mean...
- You?
- And...
You.
Tanner!
Tanner!
When it's meant to
be, you go kinda crazy.
When it's meant to
be, it's destiny calling.
Wait. What are we going
to tell Mack and Brady?
Yeah. Where are they, anyway?
I gave this to Mack. She was wearing it.
- Then why did she take it off?
- Something's not right.
We need to get help.
In mere moments, less time than it
takes for me to steal this scene...
This machine will change
the weather patterns,
I shall take possession
of Big Momma's...
Big Momma's.
And all your friends will
disappear forever, or longer.
Yeah well, there's
one flaw to your plan.
Oh, really?
And what might that be?
I don't know. Isn't there always
one flaw with these kinds of plans?
Well, I'm off to measure the
beach for a resort parking lot.
Everyone listen.
Les Camembert wants to destroy us.
He's built a weather...
A weather machine that
will stop the tide.
- And rust all of our bikes.
- Just to get rid of us.
Plus, he has Mack and Brady held
captive in a secret location.
We don't know where
it is because it's...
- Both: A secret!
- Oh, Lordy!
- We need your help.
- Us or them?
- Us.
- I think she meant us.
I mean all of us.
Our only hope is to work
together, free our friends,
and destroy that weather machine
before it destroys our world.
Why should we do anything with them?
We didn't wanna do
anything with you first.
- Together, we can help each other.
- Why should we listen to you?
I never thought I'd have
anything in common with a biker.
That is...
Until I took a ride with one.
In fact, all that fighting ever did
for us was stop us from seeing...
What we all have in common.
Big Momma's, the beach, and...
Us.
I love you, sis.
Now let's do this...
- Together.
- All: Together!
Hallelujah!
Could be worse.
At least my favorite movie
wasn't Tarantulas On A Train.
Okay, you've lost it.
If we hadn't have come here...
I'd be on the plane right
now, heading to some...
Private school to
become something that...
I really don't wanna be.
You don't, do you?
I've spent this entire
movie telling Lela,
to follow her heart
and do what she loves.
And she did.
She's more courageous than I am.
That's not true.
You're braver than anyone I know.
So you're glad we came.
I couldn't be more glad.
It's, like, I'm tied up,
but at the same time...
I've never felt more free.
You were right.
What's the hurry to grow up?
When I could be stuck in 1962 with you.
And if you listen,
you'll find your heart.
And if you listen,
you'll find your heart.
We only have one loose screw left, and
then, we'll be ready to change the world!
Do you really wanna do this?
Ruin the lives of all these people?
Just because you can magnify the power
of nuclear plutonium by 647 degrees,
doesn't mean you have to.
What?
What? It's not like I never paid
attention while you watched the movie.
How did you know that? Who are you?
We're from the future,
and you're not real.
You're just a villain in a
movie we got stuck in somehow.
No.
Yep.
I'm nothing but a...
A flicker on a silver screen?
Yeah, pretty much.
Bad news, bad news, bad news!
The surfers and the
bikers have united together
in order to destroy us and save you two.
How's that bad news?
Bad news for you.
Really? Doctor.
Hm?
It's time.
The machine, man!
Look, a ray. That
must be where they are.
I gotta be honest with you.
I'm not big on lighthouses.
It's kind of a thing.
For some people, it's snakes,
for some people, it's heights.
For me, it's lighthouses.
Oh, you can do this. We're all with you.
What do ya say?
Whoa! My fear is gone.
Let's go!
- Lela.
- Tanner.
- Mack.
- Brady.
Problem.
We are here to save you.
-  Surf, surf crazy.
-  Surf, surf crazy.
Oh, no.
No!
No! No!
No!
Look at that, Brady. They got
together all by themselves.
We're here to save you.
Oh, yeah!
Ah!
Grab the perfect
wave, say hi to the sky.
Hey!
Ah!
We can't break this thing apart.
Wait. This motor isn't much
different than a four stroke, 500cc,
flat twin, air-cooled wankel with
shaft final and rear wheel drive!
The kind you guys
refurbish all the time.
She's right, but it's too hard to get
to without taking the whole thing apart,
especially with these sausage fingers.
Not for me, it isn't.
- Ah!
- Lela, watch out!
Look out. This whole thing's
gonna blow. Let's get outta here.
I can't even imagine a scenario
where this works out well for us.
Nope.
Ah!
I'm not sure I like
the way this movie ends.
Movie? What movie?
Glad you asked. It seems we're all
in this movie, and we're the villains.
Intriguing.
Tell me more.
What is this?
How did... how did we get back here?
It's exactly where we're supposed to be.
- The movie's back on track.
- Yeah.
We can leave.
- Tanner: There they are!
- You did it.
Of course! Because girls
can do anything boys can do.
We gotta get back home.
What?
No. Stay. You'll love it here.
It's always just like this.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Where we're going, it's perfect, too.
I'm gonna make sure of it.
Hey, you guys saved Big Momma's.
And for that, we are, to
you, gratefully grateful.
Ever since you guys got here, it's
been, like, it's been a different world.
It's not just because of us.
Oh.
Friendship forever.
- Forever.
- Yeah.
Come here.
- Cowabunga.
-
Sure you're ready?
Yeah.
Let's go.
Surf's up!
- That's the one.
- Yeah. You ready?
- Absolutely. Let's go.
- Yeah.
Brady: Go, go, go, go!
You okay?
Wet, wet!
- What?
- Not what, wet. My hair is wet.
Your hair is wet.
It's a wet, beautiful, stringy mop.
And look, no time has passed.
It's exactly as we left.
We did it.
Now you have the chance to surf one of
the biggest waves to ever hit this beach.
And I promise, I won't try and save you.
Hey, if I needed saving,
I'd want it to be you.
Go shred that wave.
Woo!
McKenzie.
Mack.
That was outstanding.
Thanks, grandpa.
McKenzie.
Do you know what you've done?
We are late for our flight, late for
registration, totally off schedule, and...
Aunt Antoinette, I love you.
And mom would be so happy
that you care so much.
But I think you've been wrong.
I mean, my mom...
Wouldn't want me to be
successful like you, she'd...
Want me to be happy doing what I love,
like you are, doing what you love.
But it's not what I love.
I'm trying to read between the lines.
I wanna stay here for high school.
I wanna be with Brady.
I wanna surf more.
And later, I don't know what.
But the thing is...
I don't have to know.
And when I do decide.
It'll be my choice.
Fine.
Have it your way.
You are...
Headstrong, like your grandfather.
Hm? Hmm.
That is the nicest
thing you could've said.
Ah.
You know what we should do?
- Surf.
- Sing.
Everybody's diggin' on
the rays of the summer sun.
The sand and the waves
are made for having fun.
Grab your board, your
girl, and hold on tight.
Hip cats, hot dogs,
yeah, we're so out of sight.
Then you drop down
low, all toes on the nose.
There's no doubt
about who's number one.
'Cause when we boogie,
we boogie second to none.
We rock on the beach
and on the waves we roll.
Feel it in your feet, in
your heart and in your soul.
Surfin' day and night,
everybody shoot the curl.
Then you drop down
low, all toes on the nose.
I'm Mack.
Surf's up!
Surfin' day and night,
everybody shoot the curl.
Then drop down low,
all toes on the nose.
What?
I'll tell you what.
What?
I'll tell you what.
I'm sorry.
What?
- I'll show you...
- I'm sorry.
Come on, guy.
What?
I'll tell you what.
I can't stop singing.
- Oh, it's over.
-
Sync & corrections by P2Pfiend.
Where's Big Momma's?
Where are we?
My hair.
Dude!
You guy's are totally lost.
You need to use my phone?
Ah!
Ah!
- Phone: Say a command.
- Ah!
