One more.
Ask me, why?
I regret getting married.
Marriage maybe good for others
but it has ruined me!
My friends explained that the
old cot I'd brought with the dowry...
She is terrible. To top it
she has brought half a dozen kids!
They well remember our address.
I often left them in the temple...
...saying I'll soon be back.
I'd fiind them sleeping in my bed!
You're really nuts! Why are
you cursing the unborn kids?
Wrong! This superstar
director husband of yours...
...is rehearsing his
Oscarwinning play.
Continue with these plays.
But don't everwork.
So, Oscarwinning...
Tell me, this niece of yours
who has come from Pune...
How much longerwill she stay here?
- What does that mean?
She has nobody but me.
Does that mean she'll
live here all her life?
Softly... talk softly.
She has come to her uncle not you.
Don't be rude to hertoday.
- Why? - She's a very proud girl.
- She's come here to look for a job.
You've neverfound a job.
How will she get one?
I'm sure I'll get this job!
- I know it in my bones.
- Of course. My niece is the best.
She's educated and smart.
I must leave or I'll get late.
I don't even know the way.
Bye, aunt.
If you get selected,
negotiate for a house.
These days you get
quarters with the job.
Also a car. Run along, dear.
Or you'll lose the job.
I've often told you not to eat
chilies as it effects your speech.
- Come, I'll give you some sweets.
- Go and rehearse your play!
Stop... right here.
- Madam, the fare...
- Oh, yes.
Here you are.
Pray for me.
Can't you watch where you're going?
What would you say if
I asked you the same?
This is an office
not a jogging ground.
- The way you're running...
- Yes, this is an office.
Not your drawing room that
you're wandering around!
Help me pick up my fiiles.
You dropped them all!
What kinds of people! I'm late and
you had to barge into me right then!
Doesn't see where he's headed
and then scolds me!
Won't even apologise!
- I should apologise?
- No, I'll apologise!
Sorry, I made a mistake.
Forgive me.
He's made me forget all
the answers I'd memorised.
God knows what will happen
in the interview!
Dear God, let nobody get
selected before my turn!
- Who is Miss Sapna?
- That's me.
You've been called.
Get her application out
and read her bio-data.
Her application is not in the fiile.
- What?
- Sir, I'll tell you...
My name is Sapna and I've done
B. Com in the fiirst division.
Did I ask you?
Didn't you fiile the
applications in serial?
- I did sir but...
- Hurry up, Suri.
Yes sir...
Look at the state of
yourworld, Oh God.
How man has changed...
It says in this...
Sir, that's not my application.
I remember mine by heart!
I'll recite it for you.
I don't know how the papers
in my fiile got into yourfiile...
Oh yes! You banged into
me on the stairs...
- I banged into you?
- Don't you remember?
In the bargain yourfiile
fell down, so did mine.
And in the process,
the papers got mixed up!
I think we should now interview her.
What's your shorthand speed?
I don't know shorthand
but my English is good!
What's yourtyping speed?
I don't know typing but...
I write very fast.
I'd complete a three hour exam
paper in 11/2 hours and run out!
You may leave.
I can leave? Does that mean
I've got the job?
Please call the next candidate.
But... why are you calling the next
candidate when I've been selected?
A knowledge of shorthand and
typing is essential forthis job.
Give me one chance.
- I'll learn...
- This is no training school!
I need an efficient secretary
to run this huge office!
You may leave!
This is not the place to
throw fiiles and certifiicates.
They are trash for me!
I came for an interview
but he didn't conduct it!
He only asked me one question,
if I know shorthand and typing!
- I said, no. He asked me to leave!
- Did he say that?
Yes. Didn't people work when
there was no shorthand and typing?
- Yes, they did.
- Let me ask you something.
- Do you know shorthand, typing?
- How would I know?
So there! Yet I'm sure
you work pretty well.
Yes I do work all right but
you should explain this to him.
If he'd listen. But he started off
like a machine gun soon as I entered.
I don't understand who
gave him the MD's chair!
You... don't know anything.
I came here with such difficulty.
I'm not familiarwith Bombay streets.
I could fiind neither
rickshaw nortaxi.
Yet I came here.
With the hope that my
boss would be very happy.
You're crying...
- Why would I cry?
- Look, my child...
Tears turn into waterwhen they
flow but turn to poison inside.
Let them flow out.
By the way, who made you cry?
The Managing Director of
the Oberoi group of industries!
- That must be Vicky.
- That's right.
- You've brought me back there!
- Where are you going? Come here.
Let us leave or he'll
lose his shirt again!
Come here, Suri.
Where are you going?
Make out an appointment letter
in Miss Mehra's name. Pronto.
What are you doing?
How can you appoint me?
Why not? Do I look like riffraff?
You look very honorable.
But he's very dangerous!
He'll fiire you because of me!
He can't fiire me.
- Why not? - He's the Managing
Directorwhile I'm the Chairman.
- What?
- And also his father!
Here's your appointment letter
You're joining us tomorrow.
Get to work.
Grandma! Grandma!
Grandma, sir has come.
He's come? He's had it today!
Relax, grandma. Control yourtemper.
- You shut up!
- Yes, mother?
- Is this the time to come home?
I'd asked you to come at 5!
I'm sorry. I was in the office.
Is your office more important
than Prem's drama?
We're all ready for half an hour.
Now hurry up orwe'll be late.
The son of Industrialist
Balraj Oberoi is an actor!
Prem is not fooling around.
He's acting in a stage play.
You keep quiet. You're his elder
brother. You should explain to him.
He must concentrate on business
instead of these wasteful hobbies.
Why does he need to work?
I am here. Let him do
whatever he feels like.
He's become responsible on his own.
You're spoiling him! He's
sheltered by you! Wasting money!
- Why have you made money? Forthese
sons, isn't it? - Mother, you...
Get the car out.
- Will they come with us?
- Of course.
You should have told me. I'd lock
the office and get my staff along.
Apart from us, who
would watch his play?
Don't underestimate Prem.
One day Prem will be the
brightest star of the stage.
Oh Lord in the sky,
listen to my plea if you exist.
There are hundreds of girls
in the world. Find one for me!
My father's daughter
calls me brother
My father's wife calls me son
My mother's brother
calls me nephew
My brother's daughter
calls me uncle
Oh Lord!
You've given me everything'
Now give me a pretty wife
who'll call me husband
It'll be nice to fiind
someone calling me husband
She'll have a child
calling me daddy
The child will get married
and also have a child
My daughter-in-law will call me
father-in-law and the child, grandpa
You've kept me unmarried.
What mistake have I made?
My lovely sons would've given me
the next beauty
Give me the girl that
you want to give me soon
For all my trust in you, my
marriageable age may pass by
I may get old and may
have to carry a stick
I'm telling it to you because
you rule the world
God, you've given
me everything
Now give me a sister-in-law who'll
call me her brother-in-law
- Have we already reached Bandra?
- No, Bandra is quite far.
- Then why did you stop the cab?
- It's conked off.
- No, that's not possible.
- Why?
It's a machine.
Anything can happen.
Why don't you understand?
Today is my fiirst day at work.
Incidentally it's
my fiirst day too.
Now I'll lose my job.
You're not even trying!
I've got a job with such
difficulty. Now I'll lose it!
It's not empty.
Where will I get a cab?
Excuse me. Excuse me...
- Are you going to Bandra?
- No.
But I have to go to Bandra.
Today is my fiirst day at work.
If I'm late it will be my last day!
- So what can I do?
- Don't do anything.
Just take me to Bandra.
Now stop staring.
You can stare on the way.
The signal has changed to green!
Start the car! Please!
- Drive fast.
- Tell me one thing.
Is it your habit to sit in
anyone's car or your hobby?
I've no option. Else
I'd hate to sit in your car!
What are you looking at?
Glare in front!
I'll drive slow! Slow!
I'll turn right!
You want to go to Bandra?
Then shut up!
Stop! Stop!
Open this...
You gave me a lift forfree
So I'll give you free advice.
Don't look around and drive.
You might meet with an accident.
- You're getting late?
- Now go away.
What a character!
Good day.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to work.
Not to see yourface.
Didn't I tell you there's
nothing here that you can do.
- I have the appointment letter.
- Who gave it to you?
The one who is above you.
- The Chairman sir.
- Show me the letter. - All right.
Where has it gone?
I'd brought it along.
Do you think this ploy
will get you the job?
No sir. It's the truth.
One minute...
- Where is it?
- Your letter.
- You left it in the car.
- You!
He's my friend. He gave
me a lift in the morning.
Stop glaring at him
and read this.
That's all right.
Will you please come in?
- Go in.
- Come on.
Talk politely to him.
He's a good man.
What are you father and son up to?
One gives her a job and
the otherflirts with her!
What? This girl? She's crazy!
She sat in my car, told me to drop
her as it's herfiirst day at work.
How was I to know she works here?
- She says she's yourfriend.
- Friend? She's lying!
Creating a rift between brothers
on herfiirst day. Confusion next!
I say, lift the phone and
turn herfiirst day to her last!
Send in the girl who has just come.
- Arms look good.
- Just exercised.
- Why is your paunch showing?
- Just had breakfast.
- She's come.
- Yes? - Welcome.
Did you call for me?
- Tell him for how long...
- Just a minute.
Since when do you know him?
Him? 9.45...
- What's the time?
- 15 past 10.
- For half an hour.
- Half an hour?
Whom are you laughing at? Me?
- Go on.
- Yes, carry on.
- Who gave this fool a job?
- Who else?
What kind of a girl is this?
What clothes she's wearing!
No problem. Hail the Lord
and neverworry.
Look at this. She's
one in a million.
She's very pretty.
But Vicky won't approve of her.
The whole nation is
crazy about her.
And you rejected her!
What kind of girl do you want?
The one whom you set eyes on
and a voice sings from your heart.
- She's the one.
- Give me the bag.
She's the one who will
bring joys to my son's life.
- He'll look at her and agree.
- No!!
- You're back?
- I came to see mother.
- Seen her? - Yes.
- Then leave.
Please grandma. I've told you
I don't want to get married.
- How'll you spend life? - I've
spent it so long. I'll manage.
When will he get over old memories?
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you for 10 minutes.
Only 10 minutes not 10 hours!
You know I can't wait long.
So you trouble Mummy,
Daddy the neighbours?
Tell your parents, today I'm
blowing the horn at their house.
Tomorrow they'll come to my
house and I won't send you.
Now aren't we getting late?
Shall we leave?
Do you love me so much?
A lot. I can't live without
you for even a minute.
Tell yourfamily to
marry us off soon.
My parents did say
they'd marry us in a year.
Ayear?
You're driving so fast!
- Ayear is too long.
- I'll convince them for 6 months.
- Slow down.
- 6 months?
Okay, 3 months! Now slow down!
Then shall we get married tomorrow?
Pills for hypertension?
Sir needs this bad.
What a temper.
He's bound to be sick.
Window?
Fresh airwill make him feel better.
What's happening?
What's going on?
- Breeze...
- Shut the window!
Shut the window!
Can't you hear me?
- All right.
- What's wrong?
My head is splitting!
- Shall I give you a pill for
hypertension? - No.
Pick up those papers
and please staple them.
- Which ones?
- These!
- What are you looking for?
- This is a stapler! - Yes.
Hurry up!
What have you done?
- Sorry!
- What's wrong?
Son, what's the matter?
Why are you screaming?
- He has fiired me!
- Fired you? Why?
Either I stay in
this office or she!
Yourtie looks great.
Starting a new trend?
Take this girl away.
She's good for nothing!
She's a good girl.
Slowly she'll learn everything.
- Come, my dear.
- I'll keep the scissor.
I am the hero of my area
Did you take me
for anything less?
Get aside, lady
Get aside.
I am in an angry mood
Let go of her!
- She's a crazy girl!
- Why?
She forced herself into
my car yesterday.
- You sat in his car?
- It was my fiirst day.
- That is why. Yes.
- Today she follows me here.
You don't know her.
She's my dear niece.
- Good day.
- Good day.
Cast her opposite me.
She's come here to work not act.
I know where she works.
Being the master, I don't go there
What will she do there?
- Do you work for him?
- Yes. For his elder brother.
- You don't know his temper.
- I do.
He's as dangerous as I'm sweet.
Rememberthat dialogue.
We'll use it in some scene.
Let's go. Aunt must be waiting.
- Hey, uncle! Come here.
- Going to aunt.
- Let's rehearse.
- Aunt...
Why are you getting me
into trouble?
What? We lost this contract too!
How can that be possible?
Ourtenderwas quite low.
What was the difference in the
tender of that company and us?
All right. Fiind out and call me.
Call me later. I'm very busy now.
- Sir, what's the matter?
- We lost the contract again.
- Again?
- That's what I don't understand.
We haven't got any contract
forthe past three years.
It can be a co-incidence once.
Twice... but the third time...
We have been missing out on the
contract at very low differences.
This time it's just 2 bucks.
- How do you know?
- I saw the price list.
I just spoke on the phone.
The price will be opened tomorrow.
This means you're the traitor!
We pay you and you work for others!
How much did you sell yourself for?
- Forgive me, sir.
- Vicky neverforgives betrayers!
- You haven't left? - Neither have
you. - You should have gone.
- I thought you might need me.
- Nothing of that sort.
- I'll drop you home.
- Okay.
- What's wrong?
- I left my bag.
Has there ever been a day in your
life when you did something...
...without falling orforgetting?
I'll get it.
You use your hands too much.
Let's go. That's enough.
Anybody around?
Are you all right?
Please hurry up.
- Emergency case.
- It's a deep gash.
Madam, it's a police case.
Inform the police.
Doctor, where are you going?
There's so much blood flowing.
I can't do a thing
till the police comes.
The police? What will they do?
Will they treat him? You
yourself said it's a deep wound.
And you refuse to treat him!
God forbid if something
happens to him...
What kind of a doctor are you?
It's your duty to save human life!
You swearto save human life
when you get your degree.
And you forget it once
you become doctors!
Don't you care about his life?
I beg you doctor...
Don't do this!
Save his life!
You stay here.
- What happened?
- He...
Nothing. Nothing will
happen to my Vicky.
Nothing will happen.
- How is my son?
- He's all right.
- No need to worry.
- Didn't I say he'll be fiine?
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank her not me.
She brought the patient here
in time and saved his life.
She also reminded me of my duty.
Avery sweet child.
He has a deep wound on his head.
I can't say anything till
he regains consciousness.
You are aware that there are
only three actors in this world.
And me.
Dilip Kumar climbed the
stairs of yourtemple.
Amitabh Bachhan rang
the bell of yourtemple.
I can't ring the bell because
of the way you made me!
My hands doesn't reach the bell!
Dilip Kumar came for his love.
Amitabh came for his mother.
I've come for my brother.
Both of them fought with you
yet you made their scenes hit!
I'm standing before you
with folded hands.
Folded hands...
Save my brother's life.
I'll assume my scene is a hit.
Please save him.
- How do you feel, my son?
- He's absolutely fiine.
He'll be home in 2 days.
- Is brother all right?
- See for yourself.
Brother is fiine!
My scene is a hit!
- Let's go home and exercise.
- What's the day today?
We'll sign on!
What have you brought?
You shouldn't call from behind.
You made me drop the fiiles!
Now help me pick them up.
Sirwill be angry if he sees this.
So many fiiles?
Have you locked the office?
Sir asked me to get
the important fiiles.
I thought all the fiiles are vital.
He might need any of them.
So I brought them all over.
Did I do right?
Absolutely. I've been saying this
from day one. You can't do wrong!
- Where is sir?
- In his room.
What are you muttering in English?
Tell me the name of
the medicine in Hindi.
Doctor says brother is fiine.
He only needs some peace.
How can he get peace?
He wants to open an office at home.
- Look at these!
- I asked for one fiile!
Forget your office
and work for 10 days.
Send him to a hill station
for 10 days.
I think we all should
. the farm house.
- Pack the bags immediately.
- But Dad the office...
The office existed even
before you were born.
It won't shut in a week.
We're all going to the farm house.
I'll take leave.
- We're leaving tomorrow not today.
- You too must join us.
But I must take permission
from my uncle and aunt.
- So do that.
- Uncle's boat bobs in the stream.
Uncle, give me permission.
Uncle gives permission.
- Uncle will accompany you.
- So will aunt.
Even the doctorwill come.
- Why will you come?
- It's mental stress.
I've just been discharged from
hospital. Exercise will set me right.
Why are you laughing, shorty?
- Here she comes.
- Why have you come here?
- What is it?
- Grandma...
Aren't you ashamed to
ogle at two young men?
What sorry? Pick that up
and pass it to me.
Forget it.
All right. Tell us,
whose body is better.
But hear me out
before you answer.
I can't tolerate criticism. Nor
can I bear brother being criticized.
You don't seem like two.
It appears as if there's
a mirror between you.
Grandma has called you
for breakfast. Come fast.
Brother, this fool seems very clever.
But she's right. We are one.
Grandma!
- Breakfast looks inviting...
- You're not allowed to eat that.
This boiled egg is for you.
Take your pills.
Your blood pressure will rise.
I came here for nothing.
Sapna has taken over my job.
Get breakfast overwith.
I'll ask the driverto drop you home.
You would want me to go back.
So you can eat whatever you want.
Eat, Dad. The doctor is here.
- I can't disobey my son.
- What fun!
- What's the matter? - Khanna in
the house next door had diabetes.
He came to the farm house
one day, ate all that he wanted.
Today his grave lies
behind the house.
Speak auspiciously.
One thing is sure. It's more
enjoyable to eat your own choice.
What delicious food! Nandu, if your
hands weren't ugly, I'd kiss them!
The one who cooked this
has pretty hands.
- Who cooked?
- Sapna.
Really? Give them to me!
Careful, brother!
Give me your hands. Come on.
Whom are you laughing at? Me?
- Or me? - No...
- Say sorry!
Girls nowadays
are just great
They have someone in the heart
And they fall for someone else
Boys nowadays are great too
They flip for any girl
they see
The spicy one is now bitter, too
She's short is height,
but makes tall claims
We know, he's scared of even
the most timid creatures
And he says to us that he'll
fiight a tigertoo
His face resembles Salman's
Tell this fool not to consider
himself to be a hero
She wears high heels
and black glasses...
and thinks she's Karisma
Butterflies these days
are so very strange
Look friends, how a monkey
prances about like a stork
She wants to dance and
sing without knowing how to
One who doesn't get it,
says that the grapes are sour
I usually stay away
from such boys
I have something in me for
which, every girl loves me
She walks around looking
at me all day
My brother, don't fall
for her pranks
Or you'll get burnt
by this current
Currents nowadays
are just great
She has bathed in
the juices of flowers
She has come from
the world of stars
She's beautiful
You have made a place
in everyone's heart
Whichever house you go to,
you'll bring light into it
You'll light the
lamp of happiness
And you'll make
their destiny glow
Aim carefully.
You miss and I'm dead.
Shoot like Dilip Kumar.
No, uncle. Don't move.
Or you could lose your life.
Mister Dilip has held a gun
today forthe very fiirst time.
- I'm alive! - Now you won't
escape. This orange is smaller.
- That's too small! - That's fiine
but this fiig is real tiny.
This is fiine.
Shoot like Amitabh Bachhan.
No! That's Amitabh Bachhan.
He shoots with his left hand!
He's a born left hander. You're
born a right hander. Careful!
Close your eyes.
Hey, shut up! Talk too much
and I'll splatter your brains!
I'm alive! Saved!
You're not safe.
This fiig is smaller.
No! This is cheating!
You may move all you want because
my style is totally different.
That's a date. I can
shoot a grape with this.
Dilip Kumar and
Amitabh Bachhan are done.
Now what style will Prem use?
- He hasn't formed his style.
- Shut your eyes.
I'm taking you away from Prem.
Can I mount him?
Sure, why not? Come here.
Have you ridden a horse earlier?
No. But one must try
everything once in life.
- What is this?
- Open your eyes.
You guys cheated and
brought me here. My niece!
Help!
- Stop the horse!
- Save my niece!
Dad's running. Hope he
doesn't get a heart attack!
- The doctor is with him.
- He's had two by passes!
My niece! My niece!
Stop the horse!
Come on.
Help! Stop for a minute.
Help! Anybody around?
Save me!
Anybody around?
Somebody save me!
Stop!
- She'll get the fiirst prize.
- We'll have to stop her.
- She's a jockey.
- Still we have to stop her.
The mare is quite stubborn.
To top it, she's also adamant.
That is why we have to save her.
- In the worst scene she'll fall.
- Shorty! - Then go rescue her.
- Help me!
- My brother is coming to save you.
- Help!
- I guarantee you she won't survive.
Brother, she's crying.
She's not happy that we saved her.
- Then put her back on the mare.
- Go back... - No!
- Whom are you crying at? Me?
- No. - At me?
- Say sorry.
- Come on.
Come on home.
- Are you all right? - Yes.
- Not hurt? - No, I'm fiine.
Vicky saved my Sapna.
- Niece, are you all right?
- What is this niece business?
When you don't know riding,
why did you have to race the horse?
I didn't race her.
She ran off on her own.
- Was the mare mad to run? - The gun
frightened her & she took off with me.
- Don't you care about your niece?
- What did he do?
He placed an orange on his
head and asked us to shoot it.
- What? - He shot... - And the
horse got scared by the gun shot.
Why did you mount the horse
when you can't ride for nuts?
- Mare... - Forget it now.
- Daddy has come!
- She's nervous. Let's go in.
- Yes, come in.
- Uncle, they're left...
- What?
Two grapes, a peanut and a pill.
- I won't let you shoot them!
- Why?
He refuses to get out!
- I'm not out. That was a shot.
- Why won't you get out?
- How can you do that?
- Is this your age to play?
- What has age got to do with it?
- You're out. Go and bowl.
- I'm the umpire.
- You're a fraud.
Nobody take the catch.
She's gone in the water! My niece!
- Help!
- Help her!
Come out of the water!
- She looks lovely as she drowns.
- Save her! Don't talk of drowning!
- You save her.
- I can't swim!
Shorty, will you go or should I?
Sapna will lose her
life in your jokes!
- Then you go.
- No, I have a heart problem.
- No problem when you play cricket!
- Now go on!
- Go on.
- Save her! Don't discuss!
Give the bracelet.
The watch is water proof!
- It's a gift from Daddy.
- Go and save her!
Don't take off your pants.
Help! Help!
Grandma!
- You fiight very well.
- You lie very well.
The water in the swimming
pool is very clean.
Let it be. You look afterthe
others. I'll make the tea.
She's my pretty and lovely girl.
She's like the beautiful rose.
She's the apple of my eye.
To tell you the truth,
we didn't have our own kids...
...so she doesn't miss her parents.
Now we have but one dream.
To get her married to a
good boy from a good family.
- How much sugar?
- Half a teaspoon.
- That's all?
- Have you seen a boy?
We have but what can I say...
We don't have the
courage to talk to them.
- Why?
- He's from a very wealthy family.
Sugar? Half a teaspoon...
So what? They won't fiind a
bride as talented as Sapna.
That's quite true.
Grandma, you are great!
You have seen Sapna.
How she takes care of all.
Specially of Vicky.
His diet, his medication...
I love you.
I neverfound the chance to tell you.
You were always surrounded
by grandma or uncle or aunt.
I'll keep you happy. Very happy.
- Answer me.
- I'll answer you! Rascal!
Is this a prank?
It's not funny!
Great performance! What an actor!
He was rehearsing with him but
couldn't arouse the feelings. Hence...
Hearthat. I was acting!
Wonderful! I think you should
give up theater and get into fiilms.
That's just what I'll do because
there are only 3 actors in India.
The fiirst is Dilip Kumar, second
Amitabh Bachhan and the third...
...is you, my brother.
- Yes, come on, my brother.
She's coming. Murari, get my bag.
- Sir, I don't have time. - Talk
softly! - I have no time.
What's the matter?
I want to meet Daddy and nobody will
get my bag! - I'll get it. - Really?
Yes. No problem, sir.
First time a girl will get my bag
from my bedroom. But it's in the car!
We had great fun.
The trip was great.
It was really great.
Put the luggage in.
- Where is Sapna?
- She'll come with uncle.
- Then let us leave.
- Sure, come on.
- Prem, let's go.
- Then who will drive this car?
I'll drive.
- What problem?
- The doctor is here.
- He's already had two by passes!
- He's joking. - Son, you drive us.
Go home and write.
She's gone with grandma.
- I'll come with you.
- Why? Go with yourwife.
- She's got work at home.
- What work?
- She'll bash me.
- She's become fat?
- She looks ugly?
- I didn't say that!
- He's saying that.
- Come home. I'll show you!
Sir, there's no bag inside.
Call me Prem, not sir.
- The bag is not inside.
- I know that.
- It's in the boot.
- Is it? But where's everybody?
- They've gone.
- Why did they leave me?
They've left you for me.
Will you come with me?
Shall I deliver a dialogue?
Forthe fiirst time, a girl
will sit on my car's front seat.
My Madhuri Dixit.
My Madhuri Dixit!
Someone stealthily
comes into my dreams
Someone keeps me awake
the whole night
My heart is restless
I think I have fallen in love
I'm faltering in my step
This is the fiirst feeling
of its kind
I don't know what happened when
How can I tell you
the state of my craziness?
How can I tell what is
happening in my heart
'Someone is gradually
increasing my pain
Someone is slowly
making me writhe
This never used to
happen to me earlier
I never lost my senses
I never lost my peace
I stay awake the whole night,
and toss and turn
I remain lost
I wonderwhat I keep thinking
Someone takes away my senses
Someone just teases me around
What's the matter, mother?
Why are you so sad?
In 4 days, I've grown
so attached to this girl...
Everything seems vacant.
It's just a few hours since she left
but I feel I haven't seen herfor days.
- If she permanently...!
- If she permanently...!
Comes here forever?
- The best bride for Vicky.
- Vicky should agree to marry her.
He will agree. I will
convince him this time.
Escorted her home? Now leave.
See you at the rehearsal tomorrow.
Uncle, I feel I've fallen
in love with your niece.
- And she?
- I don't know.
If she looks out of the window,
it means she too loves you.
- If she doesn't look out?
- Don't ever be seen in this area.
She's my niece!
I'll break your legs!
If she opens the window,
I too will be overjoyed.
- She'll open it!
- Yes!
You could fiind just
one fool in the town. Me!
- How did you guess that?
- Because I let you treat me!
I never see you go to another
patient.
Not the time to be decent.
I leave all my patients
and come to see you.
It's been so long.
Did you ask me fortea?
No sweat. I'll get it now.
- Get some tea forthe doctor.
- I have some eats.
- Get some tea for doctor.
- I have good clothes.
I'm carrying shoes, sir!
What's going on? Everyone is busy.
Nobody has the time to listen to me.
- What's so special?
- There is something.
The actorwas getting ready.
Going for a play.
I'm going to the office.
Did you give me a sleeping pill?
Why am I dreaming when I'm awake?
- I'm going to the office for Sapna
. - Lord! Thank you. My son...
Cut the over acting.
My son is going to
the office on his own!
Didn't I say, he'd realise
his responsibilities himself?
You're going to the office
but what will you do there?
You don't know any work.
Nobody teaches a donkey's
offspring to kick.
What did he say?
Dad, he said; you don't have
to teach a fiish to swim.
I have something important to say.
- Put your heart in yourwork.
- I'm going for my heart.
You... in the office?
Who employed you, Miss Sapna?
Do you address your boss
by his name?
Address the boss as sir.
- All right.
- Say, sorry sir!
- Come to my cabin.
- Why?
I have to dictate an
important letter.
Come in and write.
Sometimes this thought
comes to mind...
Just write. Sometimes
this thought comes to mind...
Why sometimes?
It should come everyday!
That's wrong. Write again.
I love you very much, dearest.
I can swear by God if you wish.
That's not a declaration of love.
Sounds like a testimony in court.
What do you actually
want me to write?
I just want you to write
three simple words.
But it's pretty normal.
Can't we have something different?
Why don't you ask me
to write that?
Great! My son is really
working in office!
Tell me, what he's doing.
- Ask him.
- Just an official letter.
My son's fiirst official letter!
Read it out to me.
- What's the point? - Why?
- You won't understand!
- Read it out.
- Yes, read it.
One doesn't talk to
clients in that manner.
There's a lot of difference
in yourworking style and mine.
What will the horse eat
if he befriends the grass?
Aren't you ashamed
to be lying to my Dad?
Had I told him the truth
he would have been hurt.
- You should have let him be hurt!
- He thinks you've come here to work.
But you considerthe office
a stage and continue acting!
Look... try to understand...
- I understand everything.
- So I don't have to say a word!
No sir. I can't be compared to you.
You're there and I'm here.
There's a lot of
difference between us.
So you were saying, there's
a lot of difference between us.
If it's a difference of
height, it's very good.
If it's a matter of colour. You're
fair and I'm not. That too is good.
If it's a question of sex,
that's even better!
But if it pinches you that
I'm rich and you're poor...
- I'll erase the gap right now.
- Come here. - Yes sir?
Give this to Mr. Oberoi and tell
him he has only one son, Vicky.
- What are you saying?
- And tell Vicky, he has no brother.
- Get it. Now go. - What's all this?
- Let's go in the bus.
All right.
I'm willing to give up my car
and travel in a bus with you.
And you're not ready to give
up the bus and come in my car!
Is this how you love me?
- What is okay?
- Come on.
Come here. Give me the car keys.
Don't say anything to Vicky or Dad.
Get in from here.
What logic! I wish I was
as tall as my logic!
A little bit of peace
and a little of restlessness
Whateverthey call it...
we call it love
This happens to
everyone sometime
Whateverthey call it...
we call it love
I just keep missing you
You steal my sleep of the nights
Your love, my dear...
makes my heart ache
Sometimes we meet,
sometimes we have to wait
My eyes are awake
But we both are sleeping
In our own thoughts...
we lovers are lost
This is our state
May someone believe it or not
There is a little fun and a
bit of intoxication
- What happened?
- I was acting.
I came here thinking
I'd fiind a good job.
I neverthought
someday I'd fiind you.
Do you think I love you?
- Yes.
- I was acting.
At the farm, I told you
I love you? This too is acting.
What?
- You can't do this!
- I love you!
The public here hits hard.
Quickly go and talk to your
family about our marriage.
- No way! - Why not? - Let my
elder brother get married fiirst.
The day that happens I'll
tell them, my bride is ready.
All right.
That... that man!
I'll beat you! Talk to me of
marriage and look at other men!
It's not that. He's the
one who beat up Vicky sir.
Let's see where he goes.
Every week you come to fiix your car.
- Why don't you buy a new one?
- What can I say?
Since I was fiired, I don't
have money forfuel.
And you talk of buying a new car!
- Get the car checked.
- Check the problem in the car.
There's dirt in the engine.
We'll have to open the nuts
and bolts and clean it up.
The glass is shattered.
And the body is dented.
How much can we repair?
There are so many cars
but only 2 mechanics?
He'll fiix half the cars.
I'll repain'the rest.
You haven't slept?
How can we sleep when
our young son is still awake?
I've lived the life a man lives.
- I hope before your marriage,
I don't... - What are you saying?
You'll live to see
my kids get married!
- Wait a little.
- If so many years go by...
...your grandma's
life will fall short!
- We've chosen a bride for you.
- Bride? Who?
- Not her!
- Why? What does she lack?
She took such good care
of you in the farm house.
She won our hearts.
I am convinced...
She will be the best bride for you
- I'll have to think. - Keep
thinking. - We've thought it out.
Sapna will be your bride!
One doesn't feel hungry
orthirsty when in love.
- But would you like something to
pass time? - Get us whatever you like.
What would you like, madam?
And you, sir?
- No point. - why?
- It will turn cold.
- Then get it cold.
- Right sir.
Where's the loo?
I'll go to the loo and come.
- What are you doing here?
- Sir... I...
You're so nervous as if
I caught you red handed.
Sit down.
Get me a coffee.
- Take this one. - No, give it to
her. Get me another.
- Take it.
- Please have it.
- Brother!
- Shorty!
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.
Isn't she your crazy one?
In the coffee shop
during working hours...
- what are you saying?
- Now I'm saying it.
Then the world will talk.
Grandma's wish will be fulfiilled.
- Shut up! - Why?
- You are mistaken.
Mistaken?
- Nothing of that sort.
- Sure? - Sure.
- You're lying.
- Not at all.
Get up!
I will come with you.
Stay with me!
Who is that handsome young man?
My elder brother.
- He means the world to me.
- And the lady?
His sister-in-law.
I fiind her more of your
sister-in-law than his!
It's often said the boss sees the
secretary daily and falls in love.
No... I will tell brothertoday...
Sapna is your sister-in-law.
Don't even look at her.
She's the love of your
brother, his life.
His wife...
I love her a lot. A lot.
- Brother!
- What's up, shorty?
- Car packed up?
- No, waiting for you.
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Yes? - Like this?
- Let's talk here.
- No, I'll drop you to the office.
Forthe fiirst time my elder
brotherwill sit in my car!
So tell me...
- You'll go crazy when you hearthis
- Just a minute.
- Yes, Suri? - The papers you...
- Yes keep the papers ready.
- No more calls?
- No.
We've grown up together.
Never kept anything from each other.
I want to tell you about
one little thing I kept from you.
- You're hiding something?
- That's what I'm saying...
- Just a second...
- Yes Suri?
Shorty, just a minute.
Yes, Suri?
What? You still haven't
made the contract!
- You didn't get it done.
- You should have told me yesterday!
Write fast...
Our company has been working
with you forthe past 8 years.
What will be the mode of payment
before the contract is renewed?
What will the payment be
if the work days are more?
What will the payment be
if the work days are less?
The contract is terminated
if the contract is not ready.
Here's the office.
We'll discuss the rest in
the meeting. I'm coming up.
- Let me go!
- How can I let you go?
- We didn't talk.
- Shorty, you don't work.
Let me work.
We'll talk at home tonight.
I don't know why God is doing this!
I will tell him at night!
My mistake. I should watch my step.
- No sir, I'd ratherwatch mine
It's an office. Not a jogging park.
In my case, the drawing room.
- When I was new, I was scared of
you. - And now?
- Not anymore. I admire you.
May I? - Go on.
- No! Not Sapna
- What's wrong with Sapna?
Back at the farmhouse, she was
so caring. She bowled me over
For my family, she's the best
I could everfiind.
I am losing my sleep.
I am losing my peace
I am falling in love
The world seems like a new place
and everything seems pleasant.
I am getting lost
in your eyes
I spent my days and nights
with great difficulty
Today I realise what is love
Even I am lost
I don't gain my consciousness...
I wonderwhat intoxication this is
The views are getting better...
The climate is changing
We both have started falling and
rising in our intoxication
Having come into the arms
of my beloved, I'm aroused
We feel lost in
the shade of youth
What kind of magic is this?
What kind of a fiire
and pain is this?
- You haven't left the office yet?
- The boss is still in. I'm late.
Not late. Very late. And I've downed
countless coffees waiting for you.
I'm coming right over.
- Take a taxi, and hurry up, please!
Who was it?
My uncle. I'm late, you know.
That's why he called.
- I'll drop you.
- No! You mustn't take the trouble.
- I'll take a taxi.
- I wouldn't like that.
Come, I'll give you a lift.
Forgotten your bag?
- Sorry sir, I'll be back in a
moment. - One moment.
He must be waiting.
- Who?
- They may be awaited at home.
- At most, I'll be half an hour late.
- Stop! Please.
- What happened?
I'll take a taxi. You won't get late.
- Why are you bothered about my time?
- He must be so bothered...
- Who?
- Why botherfor me?
- Dropping you home is no botheration.
All right.
Tired of the waiting.
And no news of the beloved.
But I know, she isn't unfaithful
Then why does she keep you waiting?
- Moot point. - Show over.
The audience has departed.
- It's time to close forthe day.
- Till this flame burns, I won't go.
- May I take your leave?
- All right.
- A cup of tea for Vicky sahib,
please. - What?
Where's Grandma?
- Grandma... where is she?
...overthere.
- What's wrong with Mr Vicky?
- God only knows!
- Grandma, what do you seek from
God? - He gives me whatever I ask for.
When will He give me this wish
for a bride... for you?
If God can't refuse you,
how can I... a mere mortal?
You mean?
Nandu! Murari! Come here! Quick!
Call Balraj! Call Prem!
My Vicky says yes, he'll marry!
- Sir! Do you know?
- I know nothing! Get lost
What's it, Grandma?
- I've been waiting for you!
After you've heard what I have to
tell you, you'll go mad with joy!
- What could it be, Dad?
- You can't even imagine!
Your brother has said yes
to getting married
What's so great... What?!
Said yes? To getting married?
Brother, oh brother!
Who's the girl?
- You'll get to see, you'll get to
know. - Right away.
- Tomorrow. - Now!
- Tomorrow! - Now!
Tomorrow.
- Now?
- Tomorrow?
- Not tomorrow, tell me today!
- If you've waited so many years...
- what's another night?
- Tell me her name
- Her name is... your sister-in-law.
- Name? That's the relationship.
Come off it!
What's the name again?
- Tell me.
- Tomorrow. Now go to sleep.
All night, all through the drive,
you've kept me on tenterhooks
- Now tell me! - Let me show you.
- Show it to me! - Look...
- No one at all?
- Look. Properly.
- But this is Sapna.
- She's the one.
- Am I the fall guy this morning?
- No jokes. She's the one.
Aren't you happy?
Come on, what's wrong with her?
- What's good about her?
What happened to your choice?
Look at her, she looks like yogurt.
She's shorterthan I am! Mismatch!
And what'd people say?
Balram Chopra's son marries his
secretary! No, she's a reject.
- Find someone else, okay?
- No Prem.
Whatever people might say
she means the world to me.
She's the girl who has lit
the light of love in my heart.
She is the only one I will marry.
I'll marry no one else.
- Actually, brilliant choice!
- But you just said she's no good.
- Just joking.
- Really?
Now get married quickly and
make babies... while I take a break.
- Where are you off to?
- Now that you've found yours...
You've found yours, haven't you?
Time I found myself one.
- How are you doing?
- Good you're here.
I've got to take this weight off
my chest. I think I should...
- make a clean breast of it.
- Why haven't you said it already?
How could I? He was so happy.
He would've been hurt.
- So he won't get hurt now?
- What do you want me to do?
I was about to marry her. Now you
want me to call her my sister-in-law?
- You must. - Why must I?
I'll tell him the truth
- Why must you tell him the truth?
- Because I've never lied to him.
This could make him or break him.
You have to tell the lie
All right, I lie. But when he realises
that she's his brother's girlfriend...
- what's he going to go through?
- Who'd tell him? Not you. Not Sapna.
Then I'll have to leave this city.
- Go where you want to
- I'm sticking with my brother.
- How can I leave without you?
- Why are you crying?
- Just forfiive minutes.
- Let me cry my heart out. - So you
aren't happy for your brother?
- These are tears of joy! - Then
keep smiling through the tears. - How?
Like that.
The signal has turned green. Move it.
People will think you're insane
Yes, yes, I'm moving
- And don't you come to me again!
- Don't you call me ever again.
I won't! My brother's happy,
my sister-in-law is happy, I'm happy!
That's just what I want.
Now get lost.
Yes all right, I'm moving
Not one of them cares!
I'm in Panvel. On my way to Poona.
The signal is very weak here
I'll be back in two days.
I'll call you after I get back
Here's Prem. Put on the costume.
Let's do the rehearsal. Move it man.
- What's wrong with him?
- What's the matter, Prem?
- Vicky is in love.
- Vicky in love. At last!
Next, he gets married, and then
it's little brother's turn.
He's going to carry my niece away!
The girl Vicky is in love with
...is your niece. Sapna
What a joke! Now stop joking
and get into the costume.
- Don't you ever crack such dirty
jokes. - I'm not joking!
Is this something to joke about?
Vicky is in love with Sapna
- He wants to marry her.
- Tell Vicky you're in love...
- and you want to marry Sapna
- I can't tell him that!
- I can tell him that, can't I?
- You won't!
As her uncle, I will decide whom
she marries, and whom she doesn't.
And I know how much you and Sapna
love each other
You also know how much I love Vicky.
I'd do anything for him. You know?
I've done my bit of acting for you.
Now I'm going to do it for Vicky.
I'm going to need your help
...I need everyone's help.
- No more directing plays with Prem.
- What's the matter, Uncle?
- What does Prem think of himself?
- Why, what happened?
That girl in our group, Sonia
...you've met her, haven't you?
Prem insists on having her
as his heroine in every play
Even if she doesn't fiit the role.
Guess why? So that he can go flirting.
I just walked out of the rehearsal.
- How come? Prem is in Poona
- Where is he?
- In Poona. He told me so himself.
That's the official version for home.
He's rehearsing. With that girl!
Come on, take me there
You?
Why are you laughing?
I never guessed I'd get caught
so soon!
So this is your urgent business
in Poona! I trusted you. And this?
If you trusted me, it's your mistake.
Trust me, you're bound to be deceived
I love you! How'd I live without you?
You never even gave it a thought?
You'll live. Same as before. I didn't
bring you up these 20 years, did I?
Don't give me those lines. I was born
an actor. I'm in the profession too
If you can take that,
just fall into step. Like her.
Who says there are only three actors
in the world?
No not Amitabh Bacchan.
Nor Dilip Kumar. Only Prem.
They do their acts on screen
Who does it in real life?
Let's do it tomorrow! My baby is
so lucky! What a grand house!
And such a good boy! One has
to be lucky, yes Grandma?
Still, ask Sapna once.
- Why Sapna? I'm saying yes!
- Here, eat a sweet
- No thank you. You go ahead
Well all right. She's my niece, but
I love her more than my daughter
- What if she doesn't like Vicky?
- Didn't you see her at the farm?
- She was doting on Vicky.
- Yes.
In her eyes, I've seen love.
For Vicky
Next Sunday is Vicky's birthday.
We aren't throwing a big party.
But this time I want to give him
the thing he'll value most in life.
- Make sure you're here. With Sapna.
- You want to bring her right now?
No! Eat a sweet.
- One for you too?
You could've asked me before
getting involved with Prem.
- I would've told you what he's
like. - Get lost.
I say, whatever happens,
happens forthe better
At least she got to know before
things got worse.
God forbid it, we'd have lost face.
- In that family...
Vicky is a more deserving boy.
Siblings, yet poles apart.
One is honest and hardworking.
And the other... what a hypocrite!
And it's God's wish that
they want you for Vicky.
This isn't happening! I love Prem.
Make sure no one gets wind of it.
Gone are the times when women
would weep fortheir errant men.
Look at Prem. What difference is it
for him? He's still enjoying himself.
And why are you crying?
Come on, enjoy yourself
We're going there tomorrow.
For a formal meeting.
Wearthe black dress.
You look gorgeous in it.
- No...!
- This is for good luck.
My doll! How pretty you look!
The Lord has answered my prayers
Now get married quickly
and come into my house.
And fiill my Vicky's life
with happiness.
Now stop directing plays and get
into fiilms.
Mr Oberoi will fiinance you.
We're related now.
Why not? Balraj Oberoi Presents
Prem in every frame!
- Super hit!
I'm so happy! Nandu! Murari!
Get the sweets! Sapna has said yes!
Obviously! How could she refuse?
What could be bad
about my brother?
Besides, it's magnanimous of my
brotherto marry his secretary.
- What is he saying?
- She's your sister-in-law.
- Now Grandma, what about me?
- Later.
- When?
- Soon enough. Just wait and watch.
Yes, here are the sweets.
Come, give sweets to everyone.
Sapna, fiirst of all,
your brother-in-law.
That's the brother-in-law
And remember, for me, my brother
always comes fiirst. All else can wait.
May I reciprocate?
Prem isn't with you either?
- Where might he be?
- He'll come.
- He should've been home by now.
- He will.
- Where might he be?
- How would I know?
- Come on Rina, what's your problem?
- I can't live in a joint family.
I won't marry you before you start
living away from your brother.
- Afterthe wedding, I'll move out.
- Not after. Before the wedding.
Try to understand. He manages the
businesses. Afterwe're married...
- I collect my share, and move out.
- Are you saying the truth?
Trust me!
What are you saying man? You want
to walk out on your brother?
Two minutes. Let me talk. And you're
pitting brother against brother?
Not a hundred like her
are worth a brother
This is a private matter.
Please stay out of this.
- Go on, man.
- Let me talk.
Rina, trust me.
I'm not going to deceive you.
This is no private matter.
This is about brothers
And between brothers,
you shall do no wrong.
I've a big brothertoo.
I'm just trying to settle
the squabble.
What kind of a melodrama is this?
What big brother are you
talking about? Get up
Throw him out.
Have you had enough now?
Pick him up and throw him out
My brother! Where's my brother?
- You're drunk?
- Past tense. The trip is over.
They bashed me out of it.
Look at this... and this, and this!
Sit here. Just sit here
I'll be back.
Now watch my brother bowl you over.
- Who hit my brother?
- I did. Who are you?
What's the matter, boss?
Have we done something wrong?
Why did you hit my brother?
- It was a mistake. Please
forgive us. - Mistake?
- You're drunk!
- Let's talk when we're home.
Home? In this condition?
What will Grandma and Daddy say?
Then I won't go home.
I'll sleep right here.
- Stop this sham & just come home.
- I told you I'm not coming home
I'll sleep on the street.
I'll sleep on the platform.
I won't go home.
Come home.
Now listen to me...
Stop being stubborn
But fiirst say something
Come along, brother!
I can't get up.
And he's asking me to walk
First carry me atleast
I told you so many times
not to drink
Your liverwill get ruined
You're high
You don't understand it...
- He said this the fiirst time
I'm walking. I'm drunk and you're
the one feeling high
You used to say that
I'm yourfriend
And that you loved only me
And it never can happen
You are younger and
I am elderto you
Add to my respect...
don't lower it
This will never happen again
Listen my dear shorty
Listen my dear son
See how they are
laughing at you
I told you so many times.
It was not just in vain
There is something in my mind
Shorty's drama will stop; atleast
let my engagement happen
You've said that sentence
I think you're drunk and
your liverwill get spoilt
Is Sapna really coming here
or am I dreaming?
Yes. It is Sapna
She's looking very nice
You'll make a great couple
See, my brother
has royal ways
You are going to be
his sister-in-law
How are you sister-in-law?
You may not look after me
but don't make him unhappy
You are my Sapna.
He's my closest person
If she doesn't look after you,
she is wrong
I'll get you the right
sister-in-law then'
My life is one with his
In India...
- And the third is?
- It is you, my brother
Just let me get
rid of some booze.
Don't you go away. If you go away,
who's going to take me home?
Are you all right?
Are you okay?
Come home.
- Bring the tea!
- Tea, sir
Do you have soda and lime?
I'm feeling like puking
You know, after you were born,
I neverwanted any toys.
Because you were everything for me
...my brother, my friend, my toy.
I have always loved you.
You got drunk last night.
- I got into the mood yesterday.
- Never happened before, did it?
What if I were to play a drunk?
So I just got drunk
Last night, I had the feeling that
you were trying to tell me something
- Trying to tell you something?
- Tell me
When you're sober, you cannot
talk in drunken abandon.
Let me have a few drinks fiirst.
Then I might tell you.
- Are you pulling my leg?
- Oh no!
- So tell me.
- You really want me to say it?
Sapna is here
Sapna, talk some sense into him.
Last night, he got drunk
- Nothing new for him, is it?
- It was his fiirst time
Could it have been an act? You never
know when he's putting up an act.
I told you to drill some sense into
him. Not to scold him. Don't do that.
Still sir?
- Come on, we're going shopping.
- What am I going to do with you?
Just come along, I said.
- Just give me two minutes
What for?
Get lost and have bath.
This would look nice on you.
- What happened?
- He'll look like a bandmaster
Pick a suit that suits
his personality.
- How do I smell now?
- Better.
How would this be?
- Try it out on Prem
- But you're the one to wear it.
- If it suits him, it'll suit me.
- You can take a look in the mirror.
- Sapna, he's my mirror.
Just put it on, will you?
All right, I'll try it out.
You're unhappy, aren't you... about
the prospect of a secretary...
- becoming the lady of the house.
- My brother has made a bad choice
So what do you propose to do?
I'm about to enter your house.
- I'll tolerate you as always.
- There's still time. Change yourself.
- Time's up.
- You're destroying yourself.
Look at your brother.
How different the two of you are.
Lots of differences between us,
but my brother loves me dearly.
He won't like to hear you speak
ill of me. You understand?
I know. To tolerate you for
the sake of his happiness...
- well, I'm willing.
- Willing to do for Prem... what?
- At the engagement, she'll sing!
- Duet. With him
- What say? - I'll leave nothing to
say. I'll sing, I'll dance, and...
Let's leave now
The henna brings colour
on yourwedding day
You see many colourful dreams
I pray ardently that this
colour never be lessened
The red muslin cloth of yours...
should not slip out
of your body
The desires of
your crazy heart...
may never leave your mind
He was a crazy guy in
everyone's view
He was such a
happy-go-lucky bachelor
You have shut a free bird...
in the cage of your heart
Come to your senses.
Just listen to me
Just look into my eyes and
recognise my love
Oh crazy guy!
How do I explain to you?
Why I chose him
My brother is a simple man and
this girl is very naughty'
She is good looking but
crazy in her brains
I wonder if they'll get along
It is a pair of
a stick and ball
Hey fellers,
just listen to me
See the way he walks
He looks like his
brother's tail
Hey guy!
Just look into the mirror!
You have something in your heart
Stop fiighting. It is a moment
of joy. Be happy
Make a promise before me
that you won't fiight again
Oh dear! He's very innocent
Don't feel bad about
what he says
The ring!
- You still won't say it? - What's
it? What are you asking him?
- What's the matter, son?
- Ask him. He's going to say.
- You won't say it, will you?
- What?
Then I'll say it.
Prem and Sapna are in love
You think I don't know?
That night when you were drunk...
Sapna, marry my brother
I love my brother very much.
So you were making a sacrifiice?
No, you were about to ruin 3 lives.
You think you're great? You're my
little brother. You'll always be.
And you... you were marrying me
just to get even with him?
- No... - What made you think
his character is bad?
If you were in love with him,
you could've come to me, asked me.
And I'd tell you, my brother's
character is immaculate.
What use is it saying sorry?
You think you're some great actor?
Three actors in all of India, yes?
Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bacchan...
- and who's the third?
- You!
You... you are the one!
Now before he changes his mind...
take this... and put it on!
One minute, what was it
you were saying about her?
What?
- She looks like yogurt...
she's squat and that beaked nose
is just like her uncle's.
You said that about me?
I'm going to marry him!
You're marrying the man in black.
Have you ever seen two brothers
who love each other so much?
God protect them from the evil eye
How about honeymooning
before the wedding?
I'm the bride's dowry.
Can't you see where you're going?
All my papers are on the floor
This is an office.
Not a jogging park.
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.
This isn't your drawing room either.
You don't amble about.
I'm nervous as it is. I wonder if
I'm going to make it at the interview.
- So you're here forthe interview?
- No, I'm just taking a walk.
Obviously, I'm here
forthe interview.
