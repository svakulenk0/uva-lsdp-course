Bigelow.
- Well, what did I do now?
- Nothing.
I, uh, just thought you'd want
to know. There's trouble.
I thought you
said I didn't do nothing.
Oh, no, not you. I, uh...
I can't tell you where I heard it,
but I heard things ain't going
so good for your kinfolk...
Down on Earth.
There's trouble?
- Is it Julie?
- Well, I don't know exactly.
- Well, is it my boy?
- I told you I don't know.
Well, now, ain't that just dandy?
Here you take the trouble to tell
me there's trouble down there,
but you don't know what
kind of trouble it is.
Do me a favor, will you?
Go... Bother somebody else
while I finish these...
- ...stars.
- All right.
I just thought you might want
to go down there, maybe help.
Who, me?
You gone loony or something?
How?
Well, everybody's got a right
to go back for one day.
- They have?
- Sure.
That's the only reason I told you.
Hey, come here. Come here. Hey.
Not that I'm interested
in going back there,
but, uh, just in case I
should be, who, uh...
Who gives out this permission?
The star keeper.
Him, huh?
Well, I'll think about it.
Was you wanted to see me?
Yes, I was.
I heard my family's in
trouble down there.
Somebody tried to tell me if I
came up here and see you, why...
You'd give me permission
to go back for one day.
- Is that a fact?
- Yes.
But as I recall, Bigelow, when you
first got here, you waived that right.
- I did?
- Yep, pretty sure,
but let's look at the record.
Ah, here we are.
"Bigelow. Question,
"'Is there anything on Earth you
left unfinished, Mr. Bigelow?
"The reason I ask is you're entitled to go
back there for one day if you want to.'
"Answer, 'As long as I'm here,
I might as well stay."'
I said that?
Why, you don't think
this book's incorrect, do you?
No.
Well, if that's the way it is,
that's the way it is.
Wait a minute, now. Wait a minute.
You know, sometimes we make
exceptions in special cases.
Special cases?
Oh, you mean, if a guy led a
good life, he'd deserve a break?
- That kind of thing, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- I know the answer already.
- Do you, now?
Now, how do you know
how we judge things up here?
Eh, it'd just be wasting
your time and mine.
Simmer down now,
Billy. You're forgetting.
Here there is no time. This
is the beginning and the end.
Why don't you tell
me about yourself?
What did you do down there?
What did I do down there?
Oh, you mean, "What did
I do for a living?"
Well, you can start
there, if you want.
Well, uh...
- I owned this carousel.
- You what?
Look. If you know this story, what
do you want to hear it again for?
Oh, I don't know the story, but I can see
through you like a pane of window glass.
Now, why don't you start over?
Well, I worked for this lady
who owned the carousel.
Ah.
But I was the main attraction.
I was, wasn't I?
Every night, girls
would gather around,
music would be playing,
the carousel would be going
round and round,
the whole midway would be
packed with people,
and I'd be standing up there.
All right, everybody. Hurry, hurry.
Come ride on the carousel.
One more glorious spin.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Step right this way,
and come ride the...
The ride starts in a few minutes,
ladies and gentlemen.
Just a very few minutes. Hurry,
hurry over this way and...
-
- Do you mind?
Come on, everybody.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Ride on the carousel,
the most beautiful carousel
you've ever seen.
And this year it's
faster and faster.
The ride of a lifetime. Fifteen minutes
for five cents is all, five little cents.
Get in line.
Young lady, where's your ticket?
- I don't have any.
- You can buy one.
-
-
Up.
Julie.
Julie, come on. Hurry. Come on.
She's coming after
us again. Let's run.
No, I ain't scared of her.
Listen, you little... I've got
one more thing to tell you.
If you ever so much as poke
your nose in my carousel again,
I'm gonna have you thrown out,
right on your little pink bustle.
You've got no call to talk to her like
that. She ain't doing you no harm.
Oh, ain't she? I suppose you think I
wanna get in trouble with the police
- and maybe lose my license?
- What is the woman talking about?
Letting my barker fool with you.
Ain't you ashamed?
- I don't let no man fool...
- He leaned against her all through the ride.
He leaned against the horse,
but he didn't lay a hand on me.
Oh, no, Miss Innocence.
And I suppose he didn't put his
arm around your waist neither.
And suppose he did. Is that a reason
to go and have a "capuleptic" fit?
You mind your own
business, you hussy.
Go on back to your old
carousel and leave us alone.
- Yeah, leave us alone, you old...
- I don't run my business for a lot of sluts.
Who you calling a slut?
Slut yourself.
- Yeah, slut yourself.
- Shut up!
Jabber, jabber, jabber,
jabber, jabber.
What's going on anyway?
Spitting and sputtering like three
lumps of corn a-poppin' on a shovel.
- Mr. Bigelow, please...
- Don't yell.
- I didn't yell.
- Well, don't.
What's the matter?
I want you to take a good
look at that girl, Billy.
She ain't never to be allowed
on my carousel again.
Next time she tries to
get in, if she dares,
I want you to throw her out,
you understand?
- Throw her out!
- All right, all right.
Well, you heard what the lady said.
Go on. Go on home.
- Shoo, get.
- Come on, Julie.
- No, I won't.
- Would you like a nice, cool drink, Billy?
- Sure.
- Mr. Bigelow.
Tell me, please, honest and truly.
If I come back to the carousel
again, would you throw me out?
What did she do anyway?
She said you put your arm
around my waist.
Aha, well. There's something new.
Can't put my arm around a girl without first
asking permission, is that how it is?
No, I just don't want
that one around no more.
You come around all you like, see.
You ain't got the price, Billy
Bigelow will treat you to a ride.
Big talker, ain't you, Mr. Bigelow?
I suppose you think I can't
throw you out too if I want to?
You're such a good barker,
I can't run my business
without you, is that it?
Well, just for that,
you're discharged.
Your services are no longer required.
You're bounced. See?
Very well, Mrs. Mullin. Very well.
Well, now, you know,
I could bounce you if I felt like it.
Well, you felt like it just now.
So I'm bounced, bounced.
Well, now, you don't have to pick up
every word I say. I only said that I...
Said that my services
were no longer required.
Very good, Mrs. Mullin.
We'll let it go at that.
All right, you devil.
We'll let it go at that.
- Mr. Bigelow, if she said she's...
- You keep out of this.
But I don't want this
to happen on account of me.
- Apologize to her.
- Aha!
Me apologize to her? For what?
For giving my carousel a bad name?
A ba...
The day you bought the carousel,
Mrs. Mullin, it got a bad name.
After all I've done for
you, that's what...
- Now I am through with you.
- Go on.
- And it's for good, do you hear?
- Go on.
Get!
Through for good.
And I won't take you back
like I done before.
What will you do now, Mr. Bigelow?
Well, first of all, I'll go get
myself a glass of beer.
Whenever anything bothers me,
I always drink a glass of beer.
Then you are bothered
about losing your job.
No, only about how
I'm gonna pay for the beer.
Will you pay for it?
You?
- How much money you got?
- Forty-three cents.
And you?
- I asked you how much money you got?
-
Oh.
You don't need to cry about it.
If you ain't got it,
you ain't got it.
-
- Tell her to stop crying.
Carrie.
Well, that's better.
I'm going over to the carousel
and get my things.
Hey, you know that
bench down the road?
The one by the... By the water,
the last one, by the tree.
I'll meet you there.
And then we'll go see about
having that drink.
It's all right. Keep your money.
This time, I'll pay.
Julie.
Huh?
I've been bustin' to tell
you something lately.
You have?
The reason I didn't care
to tell you before was...
Well, 'cause you didn't
have a fella of your own.
But now that you got one,
I can tell you about mine.
I'm glad you've got a fella,
Carrie. What's his name?
His name is Mister Snow
And an upstanding man is he
He comes home ev'ry night
in his round bottomed boat
With a net full of
herring from the sea
An almost perfect beau
As refined as a girl could wish
But he spends so much time
in his round bottomed boat
That he can't seem to lose
the smell of fish!
The fust time he kissed me
the whiff of his clothes
Knocked me fiat on the
floor of the room
But now that I love him
my heart's in my nose
And fish is my
fav'rite perfume!
Last night he spoke quite low
And a fair spoken man is he
And he said "Miss Pipperidge,
I'd like it fine
"If I could be wed with a wife
"And indeed, Miss Pipperidge
If you'll be mine
"I'll be yours fer the
rest of my life!"
Next moment we were promised
And now my mind's in a maze
Fer all it ken do
is look forward to
That wonderful day of days
When I marry Mister Snow
The flowers'll be buzzin'
with the hum of bees
The birds'll make a racket
in the church yard trees
When I marry Mister Snow
Then it's off to home we'll go
And both of us'll look
little dreamy-eyed
A drivin' to a cottage
by the oceanside
Where the salty breezes blow
He'll carry me
'cross the threshold
And I'll be as meek as a lamb
Then he'll set me on my feet
And I'll say, kinda sweet
Well, Mister Snow here I am!
Then I'll kiss him
so he'll know
That ev'rythin'll be as
right as right ken be
A livin' in a cottage
by the sea with me
For I love that Mister Snow
That young, seafarin'
bold and darin'
Big, be-whiskered over-bearin
Darlin'
Mister Snow
- Carrie, I'm so happy for you.
- Yeah.
Come on. I don't wanna be late.
Carrie, this is where
he meant us to wait.
- You sure?
- Yes.
- It's awful quiet here, Julie.
- Yes, it is.
Hardly anyone ever goes past here.
Do you think the stories
about him are true?
Probably.
Well...
What are you girls doing here?
You told us to wait for you.
I meant she was to wait.
You can go home.
Why, Mr. Bigelow.
If you think either one of us
would stay here with you alo...
Oh, Mr. Bigelow, it's late.
If Julie stays,
she'll lose her job.
Lose your job 'cause you stay
out late? Where do you work?
At Bascombe's Cotton Mill.
All Bascombe's girls
have to be respectable.
We all have to live in
the mill boarding house
and if we're late, they lock us out and
we can't go back to work there anymore.
Is that right? They bounce you
if you ain't home on time?
- That's right.
- It's late, Julie.
We ought to go.
Are you coming?
Should I go, Julie?
I can't tell you
what to do, Carrie.
All right.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye, Julie.
Good-bye, Carrie.
Well, now we're both out of jobs.
- You had your supper?
- No.
You want to eat out on the pier?
No.
You don't come around the
carousel very much, do you?
I only seen you two or
three times before today.
I've been there much
more than that.
Is that right?
- Did you see me?
- Yes.
Did you know I was Billy Bigelow?
The girls told me.
- You got a sweetheart?
- No.
- Now, don't lie to me.
- I haven't any.
Why, you stayed here
the first time I asked you to.
You wouldn't have stayed so quick
if you hadn't done it before.
What did you stay for anyway?
So you wouldn't be left alone.
Holy smokes, you're dumb.
I don't need to be alone. I can
have all the girls I want.
Don't you know that?
I know, Mr. Bigelow.
All the girls are crazy for you.
Well, that's more like it.
You know what you remind me of?
A girl I knew at Coney Island.
Tell you how I met her.
We was just putting out
the lights one night when...
Is that you, Miss Jordan?
Yes, Mr. Bascombe.
- Whatever are you doing out at this hour?
- Well, I...
You couldn't be home in time
now if you ran all the way.
No, sir.
And what's it your business?
Mr. Bigelow, this is Mr. Bascombe.
He owns the mill.
I don't care what he owns.
If you ask me, he owns a lot of nerve.
What right's he got coming here...
What's going on here?
-  Oh, good evening, Timmany.
- Evening, Mr. Bascombe.
- Are you having trouble?
- Well...
Him having trouble? Ask me.
I was just setting here with my
lady friend not bothering nobody.
And old sideburns here...
Hear now, Bigelow. Don't be
calling Mr. Bascombe names
unless you're fixing
to get yourself in trouble.
- You know this fellow, Timmany?
- Yes, Mr. Bascombe.
We have a report on him from
the chief of police of Bangor.
He's a pretty fly gazabo.
Works on carousels.
Makes a specialty out of
pretty young ones like this.
Gets 'em all moony eyed,
promises to marry 'em
then takes their money.
I haven't got any money.
- That's right. She ain't.
- Oh, you found that out already.
Julie, you are a young
and inexperienced child.
And I've decided to give you
one more chance.
I'll take you back to the house myself
and explain everything to the matron.
Come, my child.
Well, don't stand there like
you didn't have good sense.
Do I have to go with you?
Well, no, you don't have to.
- Then I'll stay.
- After I warned you.
You see, Timmany? There are
some you just can't help.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Bascombe.
You. I ought to throw you in jail.
- What for?
- Don't know. Wish I did.
Well, and then what?
Huh?
You were telling me a story. You were
just putting out the lights when...
Oh, yeah.
Well, just as the lights went out,
someone come along.
It was this little girl,
the one with the...
Tell me something. Ain't
you scared of me?
I mean, after what that cop said
about me taking money from girls.
I ain't scared.
You're a funny kid.
Well, you wanna go
into town and dance?
Oh, no. I have to be careful.
- Of what?
- My character.
See, I'm never gonna marry.
Huh?
Well, a girl who don't marry has
gotta be much more particular.
About what? Who she's seen with?
Oh, no. No.
About not letting other people
get the wrong impression.
See, if... if I was gonna marry,
it wouldn't make so
much difference.
Oh.
Suppose I was to say to you
that I'd marry you.
You?
That scares you, don't it? You're
thinking about what that cop said.
No. Why, I never paid
no mind to what he said.
Well, you wouldn't marry a fella
like me anyway, would you?
Yes, I would...
If I loved you.
Why, it wouldn't make
any difference what you...
Even if I died for it.
Nah.
How do you know what you'd do
if you loved me,
how you'd feel or anything?
I don't know how I'd know.
But I know how it would be...
If I loved you.
But you don't.
No, I don't.
But somehow I ken see
Jest exactly how I'd be
If I loved you
Time and again I
would try to say
All I'd want you to know
If I loved you
Words wouldn't come
in an easy way
Round in circles I go!
Longin' to tell you
But afraid and shy
I let my golden chances
Pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me
Off you would go
in the mist of day
Never, never
To know
How I loved you
If
I loved you!
Well, anyway, you don't love me.
That's what you said, wasn't it?
Yes.
I can smell them. Can you?
The blossoms.
The wind brings them down.
There ain't much wind tonight.
Hardly any.
You can't hear a sound
Not the turn of a leaf
Nor the fall of a
wave hittin' the sand
The tide's creepin' up
on the beach like a thief
Afraid to be caught
stealin' the land
On a night like this
I start to wonder
What life
ls all about
And I always say two heads
are better than one
To figger it out
I don't need you or
anyone to help me.
I've got it figured out for myself.
What are we?
Just a couple of specks of nothing.
Look up there.
Why you can't even count
the stars in the sky
And the sky's so big
the sea looks small
And two little people you and I
We don't count at all
You're a funny kid.
I don't remember ever
meeting a girl like you.
Hey. You trying to
get me to marry you?
- No.
- Well, then what's putting it into my head?
- I wonder what it would be like.
- If you loved me?
But you don't.
No, I don't.
But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be
If I loved you
Time and again I
would try to say
All I'd want you
To know
If I loved you
Words wouldn't come
in an easy way
Round in circles
I'd go!
Longin' to tell you
But afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances
Pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me
Off you would go
in the mist of day
Never, never
To know
How I loved you
If
I loved you!
Well, anyway, I...
I ain't the kind of a
fella to marry anybody.
Even if a girl was foolish enough
to want me to, I wouldn't.
Don't worry about it, Billy.
Who's worried?
You're right about
there being no wind.
The blossoms are just
coming down by theirselves.
It's just their time to, I reckon.
Well, you being Julie's only kinfolk,
I thought you'd want to know.
Ain't seen that barker
from the carousel neither.
He got bounced too.
- If you ain't got any better than them...
- Oh, I got better. I got better.
It could be accidental, them both
disappearing at the same time.
All the same, it does
look a might peculiar.
Nobody in our family ever did anything
to be ashamed of, Clem Hoops.
Now, you just find me a couple
of good, big lobsters or get!
Cousin Nettie!
Julie, Julie.
Julie. Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
- I was wondering where you been.
- I been getting married, Cousin Nettie.
This is my husband, Billy Bigelow.
- Your husband?
- It's a fact, Nettie.
Look.
- It's pretty.
- Solid gold plated.
I'm pleased to know
you, Mr. Bigelow.
And I wish you both
all the happiness in the world.
I'd have said it sooner,
but it's kind of a surprise.
It takes a little getting used to.
Me, I never got used to it.
I just couldn't get
the hang of being married.
Was that Julie's fault?
I didn't say that.
But maybe it wasn't
my fault either.
There was only one
carousel in town.
I couldn't go back there.
- I didn't have a job.
- What did you live on?
Her cousin Nettie.
- To be perfectly honest with you, I tried...
- I would be if I were you.
Me, I never got used to it.
I didn't mind living
off her cousin Nettie.
It was... It was just having
nothing to do that drove me crazy.
Well, a couple of months went by.
Then it was June.
Everybody was getting ready for
the first clambake of the season.
Excepting Julie and me,
everybody was having
themselves a whale of a time.
June is bustin' out all over!
All over the meadow
and the hill!
Buds're bustin' outa bushes
And the rompin' river pushes
Ev'ry little wheel that
wheels beside a mill
June is bustin' out all over
The ocean is full
of Jacks and Jills!
With her little tail a-swishin'
Ev'ry lady fish is wishin'
That a male would come
and grab her by the gills!
Because it's June!
June, June, June
Jest because it's
June June June
Fresh and alive
and gay and young
June is a love
song sweetly sung
June is bustin' out all over!
The sapplin's are
Dustin' out with sap!
Love has found my
brother, Junior
And my sister's even lunier!
And my Ma is gettin'
kittenish with Pap!
June is bustin' out all over!
The sheep aren't
sleepin' any more
All the rams that
chase the ewe sheep
Are determined
there'll be new sheep
And the ewe sheep
aren't even keepin' score!
Because it's June
June, June, June
Just because it's
June, June June
It's June, June, June
Just because it's June, June
March went out like a lion
A whippin' up the
water in the bay
Then April cried
and stepped aside
And along come
pretty little May!
May was full of promises
But she didn't keep 'em
quick enough fer some
And a crowd of
Doubtin' Thomases
Was predictin' that
the summer'd never come!
But it's comin', by gum!
Y'ken feel it come!
Y'ken feel it in yer heart
Y'ken see it in the ground!
Y'ken hear it in the trees
Y'ken smell it in the breeze
Look around, look
around Look around!
June is bustin' out all over
To ladies the men
are payin' court
Lotsa ships are kept at anchor
Jest because the Captains hanker fer the
comforts they can only get in port!
-  You can feel it comin'
-  June is bustin' out all over
The moonlight is
shinin' on the shore
And the girls who were contrary
with the boys in January
Aren't nearly so
contrary anymore!
-  Because it's June
-  June, June, June
Just because it's
June, June, June
Because it's June
June, June, June
Just because it's
June, June, June
It's June!
Hello there on the Nancy B.
Hello there on the Nancy B.
- Lookin' for somebody, miss?
- My husband.
They told me he was with one
of your hands, Jigger Craigin.
Could be, ma'am, but I ain't seen him.
The whole crew's gone ashore.
They was, uh, figurin'
on goin' on that clambake.
Maybe you can catch
up with them there.
Thank you, sir.
- She gone?
- Yeah.
Billy, is that true?
ls there a clambake today?
- Yeah. First one of the year.
- Yeah.
Why don't we go?
- What for?
- We'd come back rich. That's what for.
Rich? From a clambake?
You'd be the first one.
Jigger's been the first
one lots of times.
What you need is a glass of beer.
Come on, I'm buying.
That clambake's just
what I've been waitin' for.
You couldn't find him, could you?
- No.
- Hello, Julie.
Hello, Carrie.
Julie, is Billy working yet?
No.
Mr. Snow says a man that can't find
work these days is just bone lazy.
Billy don't know any trade. He's
only good at what he used to do.
So now he just don't do anything.
You know something else, Carrie?
- Last Monday, he hit her.
- Nettie.
- Did you hit him back?
- Oh, no.
Well, I would have. I'd leave him.
You don't understand, Carrie.
You see, he's unhappy
'cause he ain't working.
That's why he hit me Monday.
Fine reason for hitting you. Beats
his wife 'cause he ain't working.
Is this before the
clambake, after or what?
It's while the clambake's going on.
Now, once we're out there,
suppose me and you get in a boat
and come back in and
did whatever we had to do.
Then we got back.
There's your alibi.
We could just say, "We were on the
island all the time. We got lost."
All right. What do we have to do?
I mean me, what do I gotta do?
Well, first, you go up
to old sideburns and you say,
"Excuse me, sir.
Could you tell me the time?"
I say, "Excuse me, sir.
Could you tell me the time?"
Then what?
Then by that time, I got
my knife in his ribs.
- Then you take your knife...
- Me?
I ain't got a knife.
Well, you can get one, can't you?
- Does he have to be killed?
- No, he don't have to be.
But these New Englanders are
funny. They'd rather be killed.
Well? Hmm?
I ain't gonna do it. It's dirty.
- What's dirty about it?
- Killing.
What's the matter with you?
We ain't gonna kill him.
We're just gonna scare him.
That's what the knives
are for, to scare him.
I ain't gonna do it, Jigger.
Of course, if you've got
all the money you want...
I ain't got a cent.
Money thinks I'm dead.
Julie?
I got some good news to tell you.
'Bout you and Mr. Snow?
Carrie and me are bein'
cried in church on Sunday.
- Mr. Snow, you startled me!
-
Well, this is him.
- Carrie told me a lot about you.
- Oh.
I told you a lot about
Julie, didn't I?
Enoch's nice-lookin', ain't he?
Oh, come, Carrie.
- Steady and reliable too.
-
Well, ain't you
gonna wish us good luck?
Course I wish you luck, Carrie.
You can kiss Enoch too,
us bein' such good friends
and me bein' right here
lookin' on at you.
Why are you cryin', Mrs. Bigelow?
It's because she has
such a good heart.
We thank you for your
heartfelt sympathy.
We thank you, Mrs. Bigelow.
Billy! Billy.
You know Carrie, and...
This is her intended, Mr. Snow.
- Mr. Snow?
- Mr. Bigelow?
I feel like I know you.
Oh, yes. The man who
owns the herring boat.
You smell it over there, Jigger?
Nope. Wind's in the
wrong direction.
- It's a good, honest smell!
- It's a powerful, honest smell.
Carrie. You still want
me to offer him a job?
What job?
Mr. Snow here is thinkin'
of puttin' on another boat
and I was gonna ask him to offer
you a job on it, but now I...
Me? Work on a herring boat?
No, thanks.
Enoch, come along before you lose
your temper and do something violent.
Well? Go ahead. Say it.
I insulted your friends,
stayed out all night.
I ain't workin'. I'm livin'
off your cousin Nettie.
- I didn't say anything.
- No, but it was on the tip of your tongue.
I was only gonna ask if... If you
wanted to go to the clambake.
It's a good idea, Billy. You've been
actin' kind of nervous and edgy.
Who knows? Maybe you
might find the treasure.
No! Ain't goin' to no clambake.
Well, you got anything else to say?
Like what, Billy?
Well, like whether
I'm hungry or not.
I didn't have to ask that, Billy.
I knowed you was hungry.
You go and sit down,
and I'll bring you your dinner.
Do you wanna see somebody?
Yeah, Billy.
- That is, if he's home yet.
- He's home.
Would it be asking too much
to know where he is?
My husband is around the other
side, waitin' for his dinner.
Thanks.
Hello, Billy.
Well, what'd you come for?
Well, I see you're still hangin'
around your jailbird friend.
What's it to you who
I hang around with?
One thing I can't abide is
a common type woman.
Everybody that gets mixed up with him
finishes up in the jailhouse or the grave.
Common woman.
Put on a new coat of paint. You're
startin' to peel, old pleasure boat.
Well. What are you doin' here?
You got a new barker, ain't you?
Why don't you stay home
and sleep at night?
- You look awful.
- Ah.
Here, come on. Put your hair
back off your forehead.
Oh, leave my hair be.
I, uh, hear you been beatin' her.
Now if you're sick of her,
why don't you leave her?
- There's no use beatin' the poor thing.
- Who beat her?
What's all this darn fool talk
about a beatin'? I hit her once.
Oh.
Now the whole town is talkin'...
Next one I hear say "beat,"
I'm gonna smash...
All right. All right, all right, all right.
All right. I take it back.
Look, I don't wanna
get mixed up in this.
"Beat her." As if I'd beat her.
What's the odds one
way or the other?
Why don't you look at the thing straight?
You're sick of bein' married.
Carousel ain't
crowded without me, is it?
Oh, Billy. You see? You belong
out there and you know it.
You wasn't cut out
for a respectable, married man.
You're the... You're...
You're the artist type.
You belong among artists.
Tell you what, Billy.
You come back...
And I'll give you that ruby
ring my husband left me.
I don't know. I...
Yeah.
I might go back.
Yeah. Yeah, I could still
live here with Julie, and...
- Holy Moses!
- Well, what's wrong?
Well, can you imagine?
The girls would love that,
a barker who runs home
to his wife every night.
Why, people would
laugh theirselves sick.
- Well, I... I know I would.
-
Yeah. I can hear you laughin'.
- Don't be so stuck on yourself.
-
- You want anything?
- Brought you your dinner.
Billy? I...
I got somethin' to tell you.
All right.
I've... Been wantin' to tell you.
- In fact, I was goin' to yesterday...
- Go ahead.
I can't. We gotta be alone.
Can't you see I'm busy here?
I'm talkin' business.
- It'll only take a minute.
- Get out of here.
- I tell you. It'll only take a minute.
- Will you get out of here?
- No!
- What did you say?
Ah, let her alone. She's
got somethin' to tell you.
And you... You've got
somethin' to tell her.
I'll be back in a minute.
- Well?
- Don't look at me like that.
I ain't afraid of you.
I ain't afraid of anyone.
Go ahead and tell me
what it is. Make it quick.
Well, I... I can't
tell you so quick.
Why don't you drink your coffee?
Is that what you come to tell me?
No, but... But by the time you
drink it, I'll have told you.
Well?
Well...
Yesterday my head ached,
and you asked me if...
Yes?
Well, you see, that's what it is.
I'm gonna have a baby.
Julie. Julie!
You ain't mad, Billy, are you?
Should you be walkin'
up them stairs?
- Sure, Billy.
- Here. Let me help you.
I'm all right. I'm fine,
just as long as you ain't mad.
Dee-dah-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dee
Round in circles
Here. You'll be wantin' an
advance on your salary.
That's only fair. Now, you been
out of work a long time.
Go home, Mrs. Mullin.
Well, what's the matter with you?
Go on back to your carousel.
Go on. Go on!
- You mean you ain't comin' back with me?
- Good-bye, Mrs. Mullin.
What did she tell you?
Some lies about me, I'll bet.
- No.
- I...
Nothin' about you.
It was about me and Julie and...
As a matter of fact, Mrs. Mullin...
I'm gonna be a father.
You? You, a father?
Good-bye, Mrs. Mullin.
- Hey, Jigger.
- Ah.
Jigger! Julie's gonna have a baby.
Well, what about it?
Nothin'.
My mother had a baby once.
I wonder what he'll
think of me!
I guess he'll call
me "The Old Man!"
I guess he'll think I can lick
Ev'ry other feller's father
Well, I can!
I'll bet that he'll
turn out to be
The spitan' image of his Dad
But he'll have
more common sense
Than his puddin'
headed father ever had
I'll teach him to wrassle
and dive through a wave
When we go in the
mornin's for our swim
His mother can teach him
the way to behave
But she won't make
a sissy out o' him
Not him! Not my boy!
Not Bill!
Bill! My boy, Bill!
I will see that
he's named after me
I will
My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
and as tough as a tree
Will Bill!
Like a tree he'll grow
with his head held high
And his feet planted
firm on the ground
And you won't see
nobody dare to try
To boss him or toss him around!
No pot bellied, baggy eyed
bully'll boss him around!
I don't give a
hang what he does
As long as he does
what he likes!
He can sit on his tail
or work on a rail
With a hammer, a
hammerin' spikes
He can ferry a boat on a river
Or peddle a pack on his back
Or work up and down
the streets of a town
With a whip and a
horse and a hack
He can haul a scow
along a canal
Run a cow around a corral
Or maybe bark for a carousel
Of course it takes
talent to do that well
He might be a champ
of the heavyweights
Or a feller that sells you glue
Or President of
the United States
That'd be alright too
His mother would like that.
But he wouldn't be president
unless he wanted to be.
Not Bill!
My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
and as tough as a tree
Will Bill!
Like a tree he'll grow
with his head held high
And his feet planted
firm on the ground
And you won't see
nobody dare to try
To boss him or toss him around!
No fat bottomed, flabby
faced, potbellied
Baggy eyed bully'll
boss him around
And I'm hanged if he'll
many his boss's daughter
A skinny lipped lady
with blood like water
Who'll give him a peck
and call it a kiss
And look in his eyes
through a lorgnette
Say, why am I takin' on like this?
My kid ain't even been born yet
I can see him when
he's seventeen or so
And startin' in to
go with a girl!
I can give him lots of
pointers very sound
On the way to get
'round any girl
I can tell him
Wait a minute.
Could it be?
What the...
What if he...
Is a girl?
Aw, Bill.
Bill.
What would I do with her?
What could I do for her?
A bum with... With no money.
You can have fun with a son
But you got to be a father
To a girl!
She mightn't be so bad as that
A kid with ribbons in her hair!
A kind of sweet and petite
Little tin-type of her mother!
What a pair!
My little girl
Pink and white as
peaches and cream
Is she
My little girl
ls half again as bright
As girls are meant to be!
Dozens of boys pursue her
Many a likely lad
Does what he can to woo her
From her faithful Dad!
She has a few
Pink and white
Young fellers of two or three
But my little girl
Gets hungry ev'ry night
And she comes homer
To me!
I got to get ready
before she comes!
I got to make certain that she
Won't be dragged up in slums
with a lot o' bums like me
She's got to be sheltered
and fed and dressed
In the best that money can buy!
I never knew how to get money
But I'll try! I'll try!
I'll try!
I'll go out and
make it or steal it
Or take it
Or die!
Wish you could come, Julie.
I'd rather stay home, really.
You go and have
yourself a good time.
Julie! Julie?
Julie?
Thought you'd gone.
I ain't goin' on the
clambake, Billy.
What do you mean, you ain't goin'?
Course you're goin'.
We're both goin'.
- But you said...
- Forget it.
I mean, that was before.
Gotta have a celebration, ain't we?
Oh, Billy, I'm so glad.
I'll see if Carrie and Mr. Snow
have room for us.
Oh, but... But you wouldn't
wanna go with them, would you?
Why, sure I would.
You're puttin' the craziest
ideas into my head.
First I don't wanna
go on a clambake
and now I don't wanna go
with Carrie and Mr. Snow.
- Go on. Ask him. Go on.
- All right, Billy.
Change your mind, huh?
- Yeah.
- Good. Get the knife?
No, I haven't got it. No.
Don't worry about it, mate.
Here's your coat.
Billy! Billy! It's all right.
- Come on!
- Comin', Julie.
See you later, mate.
- Mr. Snow.
- Hello, Bigelow.
Cast off the stern line.
Julie...
After the baby's born, maybe
we could go to San Francisco.
- We'll take the kid with us, of course.
- Sure, Billy. Sure.
You think I'm just talkin', huh?
You'll see.
Carrie, can you imagine how it'll be
when all the kids are asleep upstairs?
You and me sit alone
in the firelight.
Me in my armchair,
you on my knee maybe?
Maybe.
Maybe.
When the children are asleep
we'll sit and dream
The things that ev'ry other
dad and mother dream
When the children are asleep
and lights are low
If I still love you the
way I love you today
You'll pardon my saying
"I told you so!"
When the children are
asleep I'll dream with you
We'll think what fun we hev had
And be glad that
it all came true!
When the children are
asleep we'll sit and dream
-  Dream all alone
-  The things that ev'ry other
Dad and mother dream
Dreams that won't
be interrupted
When the children are asleep
and lights are low
Lo! And behold
If I still love your
The way I love you today
You'll pardon my saying
"I told you so!"
When the children are asleep
I'll dream with you
You'll dream with me
We'll think what fun we hev had
And be glad that
it all came true!
When today is a long time ago
You'll still hear me say
That the best dream I know
Is home
When the children are
asleep I'll dream with you
- Butter's melted.
-
Thanks, Carrie.
This was a real nice clambake
We're mighty glad we came
The vittles we et
were good, you bet!
The company was the same
Our hearts are warm
Our bellies are full
And we are feelin' prime
This was a real nice clambake
And we all hed a
real good time!
Remember when we raked
them red-hot lobsters
Out of the driftwood fire?
They sizzled and crackled
and sputtered a song
Fittin fer an Angels' choir
Fitten fer an angels'
Fitten fer an angels'
Fitten fer an angels' choir
We slit 'em down the back
and peppered 'em good
And doused 'em in melted butter
Then we tore away the claws and
cracked 'em with our teeth
'Cause we weren't in
the mood to putter!
Fitten fer an angels'
Fitten fer an angels'
Fitten fer an angels' choir
Then at last
-  Come the clams
-   The clams
Steamed under rockweed
And poppin' from their shells
Jest how many of 'em
Galloped down our gullets
We couldn't say oursel's!
Oh... Oh... Oh...
This was a real nice clambake
We're mighty glad we came
The vittles we et
were good, you bet!
The company was the same
Our hearts are warm
Our bellies are full
And we are feelin' prime
This was a real nice clambake
And we all had a
real good time!
We said it afore
and we'll say agen
We all had a real
Good time!
- Enoch?
- Aye?
You found the treasure last year,
so it's your turn to hide it now.
-
- Enoch.
And while Enoch's
hidin' the treasure,
all the rest of you get to work
and clean up this island.
Can't leave it like this for
the next picnickers that come.
Here it is, Enoch.
Fall in and get to work, the whole kit and
caboodle of you. Burn all that rubbish.
That's a well-set-up
little piece, that Carrie.
Look. Ain't it near
time for us to start?
No. We'll wait till they
start the treasure hunt,
then we'll go together like a team.
We'll get lost together like I said.
Did you get the knife?
- No.
- Well, go ahead and take one.
- Somebody might see me.
- Take it so they don't see you.
I got some sweet
business to transact.
- Miss Pipperidge!
-  Mr. Craigin!
No fair peekin'.
Oh, I didn't come here
to find no treasure.
- You didn't?
- No. I come hereto protect you.
You did?
What are you doin' out here alone?
Don't you know it's dangerous?
Suppose I was a different
type of fella.
You know, unprincipled?
A fella who'd use physical
strength to have his will.
- There are such men, you know.
- I know, but...
Every girl oughta know how to defend
herself against brutes like that.
Now there are certain holds
in wrestlin' I could teach you.
Trick's that'd land a masher
flat on his face in two minutes.
-  I ain't strong enough.
- Oh, it don't take strength.
It's just a matter of balance.
A twist of the wrist,
a dig with the elbow.
Here, let me show you a simple one.
This might save your life someday.
Now, suppose a fella...
- ...gets a hold of you like this!
-
Now you put your two
hands on my neck.
Now pull me towards you.
That's it. Now pull my head down.
Good. Now put your left arm
all the way around my neck.
Ah.
- Now squeeze... Hard!
-
- Tighter!
-
- Good girl.
-
- Does it hurt?
- Oh, you got me helpless.
Show me another one.
Uh, right... Uh...
Here's how you can pick a
fella up and send him sprawlin'.
Now, I'll just stand here
and you get a hold of...
Uh, no. No. Wait a minute.
I'll do it to you first,
and then you can do it to me.
- All right.
- And you just stand still and relax.
-
-
This is... This is the way
firemen carry people.
It is?
You see how helpless you can make a
fella if he gets fresh with you?
Aye.
Ah, Miss Pipperidge.
- I'm just crazy for you.
- Mr. Craigin...
Why, just to see your lovely smile,
I'd swim through beer
with my mouth closed.
Oh!
Oh. Hello, Enoch.
This is the way
firemen carry people.
Where's the fire?
He... He was just showin'
me how to defend myself.
It didn't look like you'd learned
very much by the time I came.
That's 'cause you came too early.
In my opinion, sir, you are
as scurvy a hunk of scum
as I ever seen near the
water's edge at low tide.
What's all the fussin' and
fuzzlin' and wuzzlin' about?
I never thought I'd see
the woman I'm engaged to
bein' carried out of the
woods like a fallen deer.
Oh, no, Enoch. He wasn't
carryin' me out of the woods.
He was carryin' me into the woods.
-
- Oh, no. I don't mean that.
I think we have said
all we have to say.
I can't abide women who are
free, loose and lollygaggin'.
And I certainly would
never marry one.
Enoch!
Aw, let him go, Carrie.
- You don't know when you're lucky.
- You keep out of this!
- Ooh!
- Enoch!
- Oh, Carrie.
-
You could never be happy
with a man like that.
I'm only tellin' you
for your own good. Believe me.
-
-
I never see it yet to fail
I never see it fail!
A girl who's in love
with a virtuous man
-  Is doomed to weep and wail!
-
Stonecutters cut it on stone
Woodpeckers peck it on wood
There's nothin' so
bad fer a woman
As a man who thinks he's good!
-
-
Nice talk.
My mother used to say to me
"When you grow up, my son
"I hope you're a bum
like your father was
"'Cause a good man
ain't no fun!"
Stonecutters cut it on stone
Woodpeckers peck it on wood
There's nothin' so
bad fer a woman
As a man who thinks he's good!
-  'Tain't so!
-  'Tis too!
-  'Tain't so!
-  'Tis too!
Oh, Enoch. Say you'll forgive me.
Please say you'll forgive me.
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone with my...
Shattered dreams.
They're all I have left.
- I got it.
- What?
- The knife.
- Oh.
Look, ain't it about time?
Sure. Hey, Nettie. Nettie!
- When do we start that treasure hunt?
- Right now.
Get your partners. Two
men to each team.
You got half an hour to find the treasure and
the winners can kiss any girls they like.
Billy? Billy!
Billy? Are you goin' with Jigger?
Don't you think that's foolish?
- Why?
- Well,
neither one of you
knows the island good.
- You oughta split up and each of you...
- Now look.
We're partners, see?
Let's go, Jigger.
Stonecutters cut it on stone
Woodpeckers peck it on wood
There's nothin' so
bad fer a woman
As a man who's bad or good!
Julie!
Oh, Julie. It kinda makes
you wonder, don't it?
Yes, it does, Carrie, and yet...
What's the use of wond'rin'
If he's good or if he's bad
Or if you like the way
he wears his hat?
Oh! What's the use
of wond'rin' '
If he's good or if he's bad?
He's your feller
and you love him
That's all there is to that
Common sense may tell you
That the endin' will be sad
And now's the time to
break and run away
But what's the use of wond'rin'
If the endin' will be sad?
He's your feller
and you love him
There's nothing more to say
Somethin' made him
the way that he is
Whether he's false or true
And somethin' gave him
The things that are his
One of those things is you
So when he wants your kisses
You will give them to the lad
And anywhere he leads
you, you will walk
And anytime he needs you
You'll go runnin'
there like mad!
You're his girl and
he's your feller
And all the rest
Is "talk!"
Common sense may tell you
- Billy? Billy!
-  That the endin' will be sad
And now's the time to
break and run away
But what's the use of wond'rin'
If the endin' will be sad?
He's your feller
and you love him
There's nothin' more to say
You ain't gonna use the knife?
Nah. I told you it was
just to scare him.
- What if somethin' happens?
- Uh?
- Something goes wrong.
- Ah.
Look.
Supposin' we die.
We'll have to come up
before... Before...
Before who?
Before God.
- You and me? Not a chance.
- And why not?
What's the highest court
they ever dragged you into?
Just police magistrates, I guess.
Sure. You never been up before a
Supreme Court judge, have you?
- No.
- It's the same thing in the next world.
For the rich folks, the heavenly
court and the high judge.
For you and me, police magistrates.
For the rich, fine music
and chubby little angels.
- Won't we have any music?
- Not one blasted note.
All we'll get is justice, and there'll
be plenty of that for you and me.
Say. Come on. Let's
play some cards.
It'll pass the time.
We'll play twenty-one. I'll bank.
What'll you bank?
I ain't got any money.
You can play on credit.
I'll deduct it.
- From what?
- From your share of the money.
If you win, you can
deduct it from my share.
Bascombe'll have 3,000 on him.
That's what he usually brings
to the captain,
only tonight the
captain don't get it.
We get it. 1,500 to
you, 1,500 to me.
Go ahead and deal. I'll bet 50.
Make it 100.
Nothin'.
Twenty-one.
- This time, double or nothin'.
- Double or nothin' 'tis.
I got enough.
- Twenty-one.
- Are you cheatin'?
Do I look like a cheat?
- 500.
- Say, you're a plunger, ain't you?
Yes, sir.
I'll take another.
Ah, too much.
- Uh, that makes 700 you owe me.
- $700?
Double or nothin'.
- I'll stand.
- Twenty-one.
A natural.
Why you... You stinkin' crook.
You are cheatin' me.
- I oughta...
-  Billy! Billy! Bascombe!
Go, go! The time! The time!
Excuse me?
Say, excuse me, sir.
Could you, uh, tell me the time?
Gimme that money and be quick!
- Look out. He's got a gun.
- Don't move, either one of you.
- Drop that knife.
-
Ahoy there, on the Nancy B!
Captain Watson! Captain Watson!
Stop, you! There's another
bullet in here for you.
Look behind you.
What do you see comin'?
- Two policemen.
- You wanted to know what time it was?
I'll tell you.
For you, it'll be 10
or 20 years in prison.
They ain't gonna put
me in no prison.
Where do you think
you're escaping to? The sky?
That's one of them.
The other one escaped
up Maple Street.
Hey, you! Come on. Get up.
You all right, Mr. Bascombe?
Yes, Captain Watson.
- Yes, I'm all right.
- Come on. Come on. Get up.
Why, those fools.
Those silly fools.
They tried to rob me.
They didn't notice that I was
comin' from the ship, not to it.
Say, this man's hurt bad.
He must have fell on his knife.
The money they tried to kill me
for is locked up in your safe.
- Fools.
- You. Get a doctor.
Get somethin' to put
under his head.
- What's that?
-
Folks comin' back
from the clambake.
June is bustin' out all over
- Stay back, please.
-  All over
- I wish you'd go the other way.
- What happened?
We had an accident.
A man was hurt.
- Who is it?
- Billy Bigelow. Please go back.
- Billy Bigelow? Billy Bigelow was hurt.
- Billy?
Billy!
- Where is he?
- Please. Please stay back.
He's my husband!
Billy!
Billy.
Julie.
Little Julie?
- Yes.
- There's somethin' I wanna tell you.
I couldn't see anything
ahead, and Jigger...
Jigger told me how we could get
a hold of a lot of money, see?
And maybe... Maybe
go to San Francisco.
Yes.
Tell the baby, if you want...
That I had this idea
about San Francisco.
Yes.
Hold my hand, tight.
I am holding it, all the time.
Tighter. Still tighter.
Oh, Julie. Julie.
- Sorry, lady.
- Where is he? I must see him.
Oh, please. Please.
Sleep, Billy.
Sleep.
Sleep peaceful, like a good boy.
There's something I...
I never told you.
Scared you'd laugh at me.
I'll tell you now.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Nettie.
What am I gonna do, Nettie?
What am I gonna do?
Do?
Why, you gotta stay here with me
so I can be with you
when you have the baby.
The main thing is
to keep on living.
To keep on caring
what's gonna happen.
Do you remember that
sampler you gave me?
Do you remember what it says?
When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid
Of the
When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song
Of a lark
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams
Be tossed and blown
Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never
Walk alone
You'll never
Walk
Alone!
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
So, that's the way it was.
Yeah.
When you first got here, you had
the right to go back for one day,
and you didn't.
Wasn't there anything
you wanted to do down there?
Yeah.
Yeah, I wanted to
break Jigger's head.
As a matter of fact,
it's still a good idea.
You won't find Jigger
down there anymore.
- You mean he's here?
- No, no.
He didn't even get this far.
Hey, tell me. What do
you got him doing?
That's not your concern.
Bigelow, you left your wife
havin' a baby comin'
with nothing to support 'em.
Why'd you do that?
I... I couldn't get work.
And I... I couldn't bear to
see her... To see her...
You couldn't bear to see her cry.
Why don't you come
right out and say it?
Why are you afraid to
use the right words?
Why are you ashamed you love Julie?
- I ain't ashamed of anything.
- Then why did you beat her?
I didn't beat her.
- I hit her.
- Why?
Well, we'd argue.
She'd say this. I'd say that.
And she'd be right.
So I hit her.
Are you sorry you hit her?
I ain't sorry for anything.
Look, I told you before.
I ain't no special case.
If I can't go back, just say so.
I didn't say you can't go back.
No, but you didn't
say I could either.
You're... You're just
trying to make me sweat.
No, I...
I'm just trying to figure out what good
you could do if I let you go back.
You know, your
daughter's down there.
She's unhappy. She needs help.
My daughter?
My baby... Is a girl?
My baby's a girl?
No, she isn't a baby anymore.
She's 15 years old.
And she ain't happy, huh?
No, she ain't, Billy. She's...
You know, she's a lot like you.
That's why I think
maybe you could help her.
Do you... Do you wanna
take a look at her?
Could I... Could I
see her from here?
Sure, you can, if you want to.
Nah. If she ain't happy,
I don't wanna look.
Well, right now, she appears
to be having a fine time.
Yes, sir. There she is
running along the beach there,
got her shoes and stockings off.
- Like I used to do, huh?
- Yeah.
Don't you think you
better take a look?
Well, what do I have
to do to see her?
Just look and wait.
And the power to see
her will come to you.
Is that her?
Pretty, ain't she?
My little girl, huh?
Let's go, Billy.
All right, Billy.
- Look, can she see me?
- Only if you want her to.
My father bought me
my pretty dress.
My father would've bought me
a pretty dress, too.
He was a barker on a carousel.
Your father was a thief.
Shame on you. Shame on you.
Shame on you. Shame on you.
- Shame on you. Shame on you.
- Oh, no.
- No!
- Shame on you. Shame on you.
Shame, shame, shame, shame!
Shame, shame, shame, shame!
I hate you.
I hate all of you.
Why did I have to look?
Poor kid. I know what
she's going through.
Something like what happened to
you when you was a kid, ain't it?
- What did I come down here for?
- To help her, ain't that so?
Come on.
Julie managed all right, I guess.
Yep, she had to.
She's got a lot of grit, Billy.
Come along, children.
Mr. Snow. Children.
- Morning, Mrs. Bigelow.
- Morning, Mrs. Bigelow.
Well, it's so nice to see you.
Won't you come in?
Thank you, no, Mrs. Bigelow.
Afraid we haven't time.
Just came by for my wife.
We have to stop at the minister's
house on our way to the graduation.
I tell ya.
- Carrie, Carrie, we're waiting.
- Coming. I heard you.
You'll be to the
graduation, won't you?
Well, of course I will. Louise
is graduating too, you know.
- Carrie.
- Oh, I'm coming, Enoch. What's the rush?
I was telling Julie about that musical
extravaganza we saw in New York.
I'm a tomboy
Just a tomboy
I'm a madcap maiden
from Broadway
We also saw Julius Caesar. Ain't that
a better show to tell her about?
Not for me. Why, I took one look at them
men in nightgowns and went right to sleep.
Good-bye, Mrs. Bigelow.
Come along, children.
- Good-bye, Julie.
- Pa, can I stay and talk to Louise?
- No.
- Just five minutes.
- Let him.
- Very well. Five minutes, no more.
Still lollygagging.
You'd think a woman with nine
children would have more sense.
If I had more sense,
I wouldn't have nine children.
Oh, Louise, your graduation
dress is finished.
You won't forget to come
in and have it fitted.
I won't forget, Mother.
Did you have a good time
in New York, Enoch?
Oh, yes. We went to the top
of the Statue of Liberty.
We went to the aquarium.
We went to all the theaters.
- Enoch. Come here.
- Huh?
- Can you keep a secret?
- Sure.
What's the secret?
I'm gonna be an actress.
There's a troupe coming
through here next week.
I met a fella. He says he's
the advance man or something.
- And he says he'll help me.
- You mean run away?
Shh.
I won't let you do it.
Well, how will you stop me?
I'll marry you. That's how.
- Will you, Enoch?
- Sure.
Of course it'll be a little hard persuading
Papa to let me marry beneath my station.
- But I'll do it.
- Beneath your station?
Don't bother persuading
your papa about anything.
I wouldn't have that stuck-up
buzzard for a father-in-law
if you give me a million dollars.
You're a fine one to talk about my
father. What about your own?
A cheap barker on a carousel.
He even beat your mother.
You get out of here, you sneaky
little la-di-da. I'll kill you!
If I want her to see me, she will?
Little girl.
Louise.
Who are you? How would
you know my name?
Somebody... Somebody
told me you lived here.
I, uh...
- I knew your father.
- My father?
And I heard what that little pumpkin head
said, and it ain't true, none of it.
It is true, all of it.
Did your mother tell you that?
No, but every kid in town knows it.
They've been throwing it up at
me ever since I can remember.
I wish I was dead.
What did your mother
tell you about him?
Well, she's told me a
lot of fairy stories,
about how he died in San Francisco.
She's always saying what
a handsome fella he was.
Well, he was.
Was he really?
Well, he was the handsomest
fella around here.
You really knew him, did you?
And he was handsome?
What else about him?
Do you know anything else
good about him?
He used to tell funny jokes at the
carousel. And he made people laugh.
Oh, did he? What else?
Look, I wanna give you a present.
I can't take presents
from strangers.
My mother wouldn't like it.
I don't mean you any harm, child.
- I just wanna give you something.
- Don't you come any closer.
You go away. You scare me.
Don't send me away, dear, I... I
just wanna give you a present.
Something pretty.
Something wonderful.
Psst.
What's that?
A star.
- Go away.
- Please, darling. I just want to help you.
Don't call me darling.
Let go of my hand.
Please, dear.
I just want to make you happy.
- Take it.
- No.
- Please.
- No.
- Please, dear.
- No!
Mother! Mother!
Failure. You struck
out blind again.
All you ever do to get out of a
difficulty is hit someone you love.
- Failure.
- Where is he?
- I don't want her to see me.
- Then she don't.
She looked like she saw
me before I said that.
Oh, he's gone.
I didn't make it up,
Mother. Honest.
There was a strange man
here, and he hit me hard.
I heard the sound of it, Mother.
But it didn't hurt. It
didn't hurt at all.
It was just as if
he kissed my hand.
Go into the house, Louise.
What's happened, Mother?
Don't you believe me?
I believe you.
Then why don't you tell me
why you're acting so funny?
Oh, it's nothing, darling.
But is it possible, Mother? For
someone to hit you hard like that,
real loud and hard,
and not hurt you at all?
It is possible, dear,
for someone to hit
you, hit you hard,
and it not hurt at all.
Julie.
Julie.
Longin' to tell you
But afraid and shy
I let my golden chances
Pass me by
Now I've lost you
Soon I will grow
in the mist of day
And you never
Will know
How I loved you
How I loved you
She took it, took the star.
Seems like she knew I was here.
Julie would always know.
- She never changes.
- Nope, Julie never changes.
But my little girl, my Louise...
- I gotta do something for her.
- So far, you ain't done much.
- I know, I know.
- Time's running out.
But it ain't over yet.
Look. I want an extension.
- I gotta see the graduation.
- All right, Billy.
-
-
Enoch Snow Jr.
Miss Louise Bigelow.
Our speaker this year
is the most popular,
best beloved man in our town,
Dr. Seldon.
-
-
He reminds me of that fella
up there, that star keeper.
Yep. A lot of these country doctors
and preachers remind you of him.
It's the custom
at these graduations
to pick out some old duck like
me to preach at the kids.
Well, I can't preach at you.
I know you all too well.
I brought most of
you into the world,
rubbed liniment on your backs,
poured castor oil
down your throats.
I only hope that now
I got you this far,
you'll turn out to be worth all
the trouble I took with you.
I...
I can't tell you any
sure way to happiness.
I only know that you've gotta go
out and find it for yourselves.
You can't lean on
the success of your parents.
That's their success.
- And don't be held back by their failures.
- Listen to him. Believe him.
It makes no difference
what they did or didn't do.
You just stand on
your own two feet.
The world belongs to you
as much as to the next fella.
So don't give it up.
And try not to be scared
of people not liking you.
Just you try liking them.
And just keep your
faith and your courage
and you'll turn out all right.
It's like what we used to sing every
morning when I was a boy at school.
Maybe you still sing it.
"When you walk through a storm
"hold your head up high."
You know that one?
And don't be afraid of the dark
Believe him, darling. Believe.
At the end of the storm
ls a golden sky
And the sweet silver song
Of a lark
- I loved you, Julie.
-  Walk on through the wind
Know that I loved you.
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams
Be tossed and blown
Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk
Alone
You'll never walk
Alone!
