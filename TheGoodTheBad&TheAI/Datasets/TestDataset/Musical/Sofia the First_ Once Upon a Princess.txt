Oh.
Once upon a time...
- Oh, I want to tell it!
- Me, too!
Okay. We'll all tell it.
- Wonderful!
- Mmm-hmm.
You start.
Once upon a time,
in the magical kingdom of Enchancia,
there lived a young girl named Sofia.
Sofia led a simple life,
working at the village shoe shop
with her mother, Miranda.
One fateful day, they were
summoned by King Roland II,
who needed a new pair
of royal slippers.
Oh, I hope they're blue!
No, red!
We'll see.
Sofia and her mother
arrived at the castle.
Sofia was very excited to meet the King.
Miranda placed
a slipper on the King's foot.
It was a perfect fit. And so were they!
King Roland and Miranda
were soon married.
And what seemed like
a storybook ending...
...was really a storybook beginning.
Sofia! It's time to go! Come on, honey.
The coach is waiting.
Coming!
- Good luck, Sofia!
- Don't forget about us!
Bye, Jade! Bye, Ruby!
Bye, Sofia!
Bye!
Mom! We're almost there!
I wonder what our room will look like.
Sofia, now that we're living in the castle,
you're going to have your own bedroom.
Yes!

Uh-oh.
Looks like someone's not going to be
the fairest in the land anymore.
Amber, James, I trust you'll do your best
to make your new sister feel welcome.
Of course, Father.
Your Majesty.
King Roland II.
Queen Miranda.
- Hey there!
- Good morrow, Sofia.
Great morrow, Prince James!
Princess Amber,
I'm so excited we're sisters!
Stepsisters.
Amber, James,
I know there aren't many fairy tales
about kind and loving stepmothers.
But I hope to change that.
These are for you. I sewed them myself.
It's our family crest.
That's right, James.
Because that is what
all this is really about,
becoming a new family.
Sofia, welcome to the family.
All hail Queen Miranda
and Princess Sofia!
Grow ye, flora!
Cedric. I said flowers, not showers.
Oh. Excuse me, Your Highness.
I'm still breaking in my new wand.
That's Cedric, our royal sorcerer.
He comes from along line
of royal sorcerers.
So, we're stuck with him.
Mmm. Ooh!
-- Ooh.
Rose petals.
Should I wave?
Yes. You should wave.
Right. Hi! Hello!
We don't have to curtsey
unless they're royalty.
I think it's going to take me a while
to get the hang of things around here.
Just follow my lead and you'll be okay.
Great.
That means I lead. You follow.
Oh. Okay. Following.
Oh, be careful, mate.
That's the new princess' throne.
Child! Watch where you're dawdling.
Mr. Ceedric!
It's Cedric.
It's so great to meet a real live sorcerer.
That flower trick was amazing.
If by amazing, you mean
a complete waste of my talents,
then, yes, thank you.
I should be out slaying dragons,
battling ogres.
But, no!
King Roland has me doing parlor tricks
when I should be...
- Mr. Ceedric?
I am Baileywick. The castle steward.
It is my responsibility to make sure
everything in the castle
is where it should be,
when it should be,
and you, my dear, should be
in the banquet hall, 30 seconds ago.
- Oh, right.
- Off you go.
Going.
Hmm.
Mmm.
- Sofia.
Yes, Your Majesty?
Call me Roland.
Or, "You with the crown."
Or Dad.
It's a tradition to provide
an official welcome
to every new member
of the royal family.
For your mother, it was the wedding.
But for you, we will be throwing
a royal ball in your honor at week's end.
- Brilliant!
- James, manners.
Sorry.
A ball? Just for me?
Father, why didn't I get a ball?
You did, Amber.
When you and your brother were born.
You don't remember?
Sofia, it will be your royal debut.
And you and I
shall dance the first waltz.
Oh, Rollie. You're so sweet.
I have to dance?
Why, what better way to let everyone
in the tri-kingdom area know
that Princess Sofia has arrived!
This is my room?
No, sweetie. This is your room.
It's so huge.
Looks like the standard princess suite
to me.
You've got your canopy bed,
window seat, playing area,
reading nook.
And in here, you'll find all your gowns
and royal accessories.
Wow.
Now, if you need anything at all,
any time of day,
all you have to do is ring this bell.
Yes, mum. You rang?
Do you need anything?
I don't know. Do I?
Well, when you know what you need,
you know what to do.
Good evening, Princess Sofia.
'Night.
And a ball
where they want me to dance
I'm just a little girl
from a small, small town
I'm too short for gowns
I look bad in crowns
And I'm gonna make
a bajillion mistakes
I don't know the rules
I don't want the jewels
And these feet were made
for comfortable shoes
Shelves bursting with trinkets
that I'm afraid to touch
Fancy toys and ginormous pillows
It's all much too much
Cancel my debut
Keep your royal crew
Sofia?
Oh, Mom!
What's the matter, sweetheart?
I don't want a royal ball.
Oh, Sofia. I've never known you
to turn down a party,
especially one thrown just for you.
But I don't know anything
about being a princess.
And I don't know how to dance.
I'm going to trip
and everyone's going to laugh at me.
You'll do fine.
And besides,
no one ever laughs at a princess.
Says who?
Come here, Sofia.
Just try the best you can.
And if it's not good enough for all those
stuffy dukes and duchesses,
then that's their problem. Mmm-hmm?
Sofia, I have something for you.
Consider it a welcome gift.
It's beautiful.
It's a very special amulet,
so you must promise to never take it off.
That way you'll never lose it.
I promise.
Now, you best run off to bed.
You have princess school
in the morning.
- Princess school?
- Royal Prep.
Where all the princes and princesses
from every kingdom
go to learn our royal ways,
including everything you'd need
to know for the royal ball,
which I'm very much looking forward to.
Me, too. Thank you.
Good night, Sofia.
'Night.
Everything's going to be just fine.
-- Ooh.
Sorry, Mr. Ceedric.
Cedric. Why can't you... Your amulet.
Isn't it lovely? The King gave it to me.
Well, good night!
She has the Amulet of Avalor!
But not for long.
Oh, how could I have missed it?
After all these years,
I can't believe the Amulet of Avalor
was right under my nose.
Yes. Now, all I have to do
is pry it from the princess
and I'll finally have the power
to take over the kingdom!
Maybe I am ready to be a princess.

This is a castle, not a farm.
Out! Out, out! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

Breakfast will be ready in five minutes.
And then it's off to school.
Whoa! Steady now.
-- Wow.
Hey, Sofia.
Hi! Wait for me.
Why do the horses have...
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!
Amazing.

That's great because I need to learn
to act like one by Friday.

I'm afraid it will take a little longer
than a few days
to learn how to be a princess.
You see...

Time for your first class, dear.
Good luck.
Class, we have a new student.
How should we greet her?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Ooh!
- Oh, dear.
- Let me help you with that.
- Here's your book.
And then she dropped her forks
all over the floor.
Hi! I'm Sofia. Amber's sister.
Stepsister.
- Wow. Nice amulet.
- Thank you.
- Are you going to wear it to your ball?
- We're all going.
We can't wait.
- Whoo!
- Oh!
Hey, Amber. What's going on?
I think it's time Sofia took a ride
on the magic swing.
I don't know, Amber.
Father asked us
to make her feel welcome.
Isn't that how you welcome
all the new students?
Well, all right.
Hey, Sofia.
Oh, hi, James. What's going on?
Have you tried
the enchanted swing set?
You don't have to kick. It swings itself.
Go on. Try it.
Swings itself.
Never heard of that before.
Hmm.
Oh.
Uh...
Oh, no.
Here we go.
Whoa.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Good one, James. You got me.
Oh.
Don't worry.
The first day is always the hardest.
He played the same prank on me.
I better go dry off before the next class.
Sofia, wait!
I thought you said she was your sister.
She is.
What's that sound?
Oh, look. A baby bird.
It's all right. I can help.
There you go.
Just the two of you.
The way it should be.
Huh?
I guess I gotta go back.
Bye.
Thank you!
Thank you.
Huh?
We shouldn't have played that prank.
Sofia, wait!
Princess Sofia!
Oh, how was your first day of school,
my dear?
Tougher than I thought it would be.
Oh, poor thing.
Well, then, how would you like
a private tour of my lair?
I... I mean, workshop.
You know, not even the King himself
has seen it.
Hmm?
Just up the stairs. Come along.
And this, my dear,
is where the magic happens.
Oh, that's just Wormwood, my raven.
Now, you stop it, Wormie!
You're scaring the princess.
Now, I make all the royal potions
right here.
Wow! This is really neat, Mr. Ceedric.
Hey, that looks just like my amulet.
Well, I'll be a dragon's uncle,
you're right.
Oh, but if you had the Amulet of Avalor,
you'd know,
for it contains powerful magic.
With each deed performed,
for better or worse,
a power is granted, a blessing or curse.
- Really?
- Well, yeah, you know,
if it's the real amulet.
But only a certified sorcerer,
such as myself, could tell for sure.
If you like, I can take a quick look at it.
I don't know.
Oh, I'll give it right back. I promise.
But I promised never to take it off.
And my mother says, "A broken promise
can never be glued back together."
How irritatingly charming.
Oh, well, look at the time.
Hope you enjoyed the tour.
I know how hard it can be
adjusting to royal life.
So, if you ever need any help,
my door is always open.
Ooh! I'll get that amulet.
Well, should we wake her up?
Are you kidding? The girl screamed
like a banshee yesterday.
And I got sensitive ears.
- I'm not going to scream.
- That's a relief.
- You can hear us?
- You can talk?
"Can he stop talking?"
is a better question.
Hey!
So, what are we dealing with here?
Some kind of a magic spell
or something?
Hmm.
"With each deed performed,
for better or worse,
"a power is granted,
a blessing or curse."
I helped a baby bird yesterday
and I think the amulet gave
me the power to talk to animals!
Oh.
That is great, kid,
'cause there's a few things that
I've been meaning to talk
to you princesses about.
Clover, not now.
She needs to get dressed for school.
It's okay, Clover. Tell me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You ever heard of
personal space, momma? Put me down.
Oh, sorry. You're just so cute
and cuddly I couldn't help it.
- Yeah, well, please, help it.
Okay. Now, why do you think
us woodland creatures
have been helping you princesses
for all these years?
I don't know.
Tell me.
'Cause we gotta eat.
And you got the food.
We've helped princesses
for many eons
We make your bed
Clean up your messes
Wake you up
And put on all your dresses
And what's our reward?
What thanks do we get?
Not a crumb, not a morsel
No brie, no baguette
Did you really think
after all these years
When we did your chores
we were volunteers?
- Fill our tummy
Wet our beak
- Like breakfast
- Dinner
A nut, a seed, a bean
or just some rice
'Cause a little bit of food
would sure be nice
It really isn't much
Not too much for us to ask
After helping you daily
with each little task
Just a bite or two
Such a modest fee
Even little songbirds
Shouldn't sing for free
Well, if food is what you want...
...- you've come to the right castle.
- Follow me.
A little bit to munch
And there's nothing quite like brunch
Of whatever tasty treat
all the royal people eat
We'd be glad to make some room
for a lentil or legume
If you want some first-class service
there 's a price
- Oh, a little bit of food
A little bit of food
- Just a little bit of food
Just a little bit of food
Nice.
Time for school.
Mmm-hmm.
Don't worry about the other kids, Sofia.
You gotta keep your eye on the ball.
And I'm talking about
your royal ball, honey.
You're right, Clover.
I'm going to learn
how to be the best princess ever.
That'll show 'em.
Yo! You go, princess.
Hmun dang zawng aia tlawma

Take the horses in back.
Give them something to eat.
I want the gold-ware, not the silverware.
Coming through to the kitchen.
This is a royal occasion, not a picnic.
Sorry, sir.
Make it work, everyone.
Sofia, how was school?
I thought being a princess
would be easy.
- But it's really hard.
- Hmm.
I know just what you need.
Jade! Ruby!
I thought you could use
some familiar faces.
Thanks, Mom!
Jade! Ruby! I'm so glad to see you.
Hi, Sofia!
- How many gowns do you have?
- Uh... Lots.
- We've really missed you, Sofia.
- I've missed you, too.
Oh, how many tiaras?
Five. No, six.
Oh.
Here. Let me help you with that.
Prince James.
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry. I've been a royal dunce.
- But I want to make it up to you.
- How?
Well, by teaching you all the royal stuff
you need to know for the ball.
We can start with how to pour
the perfect cup of tea.
Prince James poured me tea!
Best curtsey I've seen all year.
You're all set for the ball now.
My work here is done.
- There is one more thing.
- What?
I can't dance.
Is that all? No problem.
We have dance class
with Professor Popov tomorrow.
But the ball is tomorrow night.
One class with Popov and you'll be
dancing circles around all of us.
Trust me. Okay?
Okay.
Sofia, don't even think about touching
those stinky shoes.
I brought an extra pair just for you.
Thanks, Amber.
You're very welcome.
Now, hurry up and get ready.
Children, gather round.
So you think you can waltz, eh?
We shall see about that.
I need volunteer!
Mmm.
New girl. Excellent. Pop-pop-pop.
Follow my lead. If you dare.
Mmm.
Oh!
What's going on?
Whoa!
Oh.
Uh.
Oh, Sofia. I must have grabbed a pair of
Cedric's trick shoes by mistake.
He's always leaving his stuff
lying around the castle.
Sorry about that.
Coachman, can we get going?
The ball starts in four hours.
I'll barely have enough time
to get dressed.
Ah. Princess Sofia.
The ballroom is almost ready.
It's beautiful.
There's only one thing missing.
A princess.
It's your time to shine, Sofia.
And I can't wait to see your first waltz.
- Hmm?
- Oh, Mr. Ceedric?
- Hi!
- It's Cedric.
- May I come in?
- Must you?
What is it?
Remember how you said
if I ever needed any help?
Of course I remember.
I was the one who said it.
Well, I was wondering,
do you have a spell that
can make me a good dancer?
It's for the ball tonight.
I don't want to look silly
in front of everyone.
Mmm?
Mmm.
Yes. Everyone will be there.
I have just the spell for you.
Yes, I do.
And here we are.
No, no, no. Not now!
You must wait until the waltz begins.
Then just say those three magic words
and you'll become the best dancer
in the kingdom.
Thanks, Mr. Ceedric.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
That makes two of us.
Oh, come on.
You didn't really think
I gave her a dancing spell, did you?
When she utters the magic words
I gave her,
everyone in the ballroom
will fall into a deep sleep,
even her dear old mom and dad.
And I'll only wake them up
if she hands over the amulet.
And then the kingdom will be mine!
You look lovely, Miss Amber.
Perfect as usual.
I need to talk to my sister. Alone.
Mmm-hmm.
How do I look?
You gave Sofia the trick shoes
on purpose.
If I recall,
you played a prank on her, too.
What you did wasn't a prank.
She needed those dance lessons.
You're trying to ruin her ball.
And I know why.
Because she doesn't belong here?
No. Because everyone likes her
more than you.
And after what you did today, so do I.
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do.
Wait. James! Come back!
Oh.
MY gown!
Suzette! Marcie!
Look at you, Princess Sofia.
Pretty, pretty, pretty.
- Sofia! You look beautiful!
- You look gorgeous.
Prettiest princess in the palace.
All hail Princess Sofia.
- Sofia.
- Your Majesty.
It's almost sleepy time!
Shall we dance?
Somnibus Populi Cella.
What?
It's working.
Soon everyone in the ballroom
will be asleep.
Oh, no!
Mom? Mom? I must have said it wrong.
Please wake up.
Help! Help! Help! Someone. Anyone.
Mr. Ceedric?
Guards? Suzette? Marcie? Help!
What have I done?
Cinderella? What are you doing here?
Your amulet brought me here.
It links all the princesses that ever were.
And when one of us is in trouble,
another will come to help.
Why are you so sad, Sofia?
I tried to use a magic spell
to make myself a good dancer,
but it put everyone to sleep.
I should have just let them laugh at me.
Can you undo the spell?
Only you can do that.
But I think I can help you find your way.
Everyone's heard about the day
that true love came for me
He carried me off and far away
from my stepfamily
But ever since I wed the prince
and left my hurt behind
There's one regret! won't forget
that weighs upon my mind
My stepsisters let their jealousy
harden their heart
But when they ruined my ball gown
that's not all they tore apart
If only we had tried to see
a way to start anew
We may have found
that this time 'round
You suddenly feel that all is lost
Frightened and alone
But maybe yours isn't the only heart
That's sinking like a stone
Though many of the ones you love are
frozen in a trance
Someone who's a lot like you
never made it to the dance
But Amber's been so mean to me.
Perhaps all she needs
is a second chance.
- You could be true sisters
- Sisters
What do you want?
I've done something terrible.
Come on, I'll show you.
A dancing spell put everyone to sleep?
I must have said it wrong.
It's all my fault.
No, Sofia.
You wouldn't have needed the spell
if I didn't give you those trick shoes.
I was just jealous because
everyone likes you more than me.
Even my own brother.
That's not true. You're the most
popular princess at Royal Prep.
You have no idea how happy I was
when I found out
we were going to be stepsisters.
Sofia, we're sisters.
How are we gonna wake them up?
Hmm.
Oh, I bet Cedric has a counter-spell
in one of his books.
Oh. But his workshop is always locked.
Not if you have the key.
Give me a boost.
Got it.
Whoa!
I forgot about Wormwood.
He won't let us get near the spell book.
We'll need more help.
From who? Everyone's asleep.
Not everyone.
- Just follow the plan.
- We have a plan?
Hey. Those are the animals
that used to help me clean my room.
I wondered what happened to them.
Get his beak!
Got it.
Oh, you little...
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Take that, birdbrain!
Stop it.
- Get the spell book!
- Got it.
Oh.
Claws off my sister!
Eye peck away. Get it.
- Stop that!
- Amber, over here!
Got him!
All right, sports fans,
that may be the first time
Amber's picked up a broom,
but she sure knows how to use it.
Let's find that counter-spell.
Oh! Where is it?
I don't know.
Yo, Wormwood! Why so quiet?
Worried we'll tell the other ravens
you got outsmarted by a rabbit?
Hardly!
We'll see who has the last laugh.
They'll never find the counter-spell.
Oh, they've got your master's
spell book, birdbrain.
But the counter-spell book is hidden
behind the painting.
So the joke's on them.
Thanks, Wormwood!
She heard what I said? No!
Found it. Let's go.
- What's wrong?
- I can't go in there looking like this.
- You go on.
- Not without you.
Come on.
I've been fixing my dolls' dresses
for years.
There you go. Good as new.
Thank you, Sofia.
Guess I gotta go try to waltz now.
Wait. There's something I can fix, too.
I owe you a dance lesson.
Oh.
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One...
Populi Cella Excitate.
Amber, it's working.
Sofia, are you ready?
I am.
Merlin's mushrooms!
Ow!
Sorry.
I'm afraid I'm not a very good dancer.
I never paid much attention
in Popov's class.
But you certainly did.
You dance wonderfully.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I mean, Dad.
I had a little extra help from Amber.
- I taught her everything she knows.
- Huh?
Mom, would you like to dance?
Of course, James.
Ooh.
I've been wondering, why do they
call you "Roland the Second"?
Because my father, the former king,
was also named Roland.
So I guess that makes me
Sofia the First.
I guess it does.
Oh.
