I am the great detective
I take advice from none
I’ll even find a pimple
On a giant elephant
I do fight like a lion
I do work like a bee
My dog-like nose sniffs so fine
My eagle-eye can see.
My iron hand is dreadful
You’ll tremble and you’ll flee
And it’s completely futile
To hide away from me
More agile than a monkey
More mighty than a whale
My dog-like nose knows something
My eagle-eye can’t fail.
I’ve been to many places
I’m up to any task
Soon all your pretty faces
Are gonna be unmasked
I vanish in the twilight
I dive and swim so deep
My dog-like nose stands upright
My eagle-eye can peep
These days children are so selfish
There’s no way to keep them docile
We spend all our nerves on them
But they spit on it in return
Oh, she is so naughty, she ran from palace mad!
Oh, she is so naughty—she so upset her dad!
These days children are demanding
But they can’t be repremanded
They want song and dance till dawn
From parents  they got too withdrawn
Oh, she is so naughty, she ran from palace mad!
Oh, sheis so naughty—she so upset her dad!
Children are indeed our penance
They’re a misbehaving menace
Since we bought them costly tutors
Still, without them life is stupor
Oh, she is so naughty, she ran from palace mad!
Oh, sheis so naughty—she so upset her dad!
Sun’s ray so pure and golden
Clouds trapped behind their shroud
And  now this wall has stolen
That union we’d avowed
Night will pass, come morning bright and clear
Trust that happiness awaits us
Night will pass, will pass these times of fear
The sun shall then rise
The sun shall then rise
Birds ceased their song till morning
Stars touch our roofs with light
Through whirlwinds of our mourning
Do hear my voice tonight
Night will pass, come morning bright and clear
Trust that happiness awaits us
Night will pass, will pass these times of fear
The sun shall then rise
The sun shall then rise
Why, you are my little poor troubadummy child
How your figure has thinned out after all this while
Rest in comfort of your father and king
--I   d o  n o t  w a n t  a n y t h i n g!
Your hysterical condition is dangerous
Have a dietetic egg to encourage us
Maybe doctors can prescribe you a pill?
--T h i s   i s  q u i t e   a g a i n s t   m y   w i l l!
Why, my princess drowned in sorrowful fantasies
Soon we’ll have ourselves musicians from overseas
Choose among them whom your heart may desire
--I   d o  n o t  w a n t  a n y,  S i r e!
Perhaps we have no household of our own
But we don’t pay a dime to tax collectors
We’re laborers of  knife as well as axe
Romantics always living on the road
We don’t want to live any other way
We don’t want to live any other way
We walk on the edge, we walk on the edge
We walk on our precious edge
We roam around from morning until dawn
Somebody else’s boots give our feet blisters
We’re laborers of  knife as well as axe
Romantics living freely on the road
We don’t want to live any other way
We don’t want to live any other way
We walk on the edge, we walk on the edge
We walk on our precious edge
Our feet are licked by tongues of fire all night
Why don’t these touchy-feely people love us
Us laborers of knife as well as axe,
Romantics living freely on the road
We don't want to live any other way... We are walking on edge...
The whole world’s in our hands
We’re stars so well-reputed
And we will pulverize
Competitors and suitors
We came to you just for a bit
Privyet, Bon Jour, Hello
Now fall in love with us and quick
You’re in great luck, you know!
And now, my dears
Lend me your ears
And perhaps you’d better
Clap for us together
When we begin to sing
All eyes with joy do weep
And we already know
That things are meant to be
We came to you just for a bit
Privyet, Bon Jour, Hello
Now fall in love with us and quick
You’re in great luck, you know!
And now, my dears
Lend me your ears
And perhaps you’d better
Clap for us together
Rocka, rocka, rocka bye
Don’t sleep on the edge, good night
On the edge I always sleep
And no bad dreams ever creep
Rocka, rocka, rocka bye
Don’t sleep on the edge, good night
I can’t sleep next to the wall
My knees press 'cause I’m so tall
Think on edge I’ll lie
Don’t lie there!
Gonna sleep so nice
Don’t lie there!
Gonna make you cry
Don’t lie there, don’t lie there!
A grey wolf will come at night
And will take of you a bite
THE END
