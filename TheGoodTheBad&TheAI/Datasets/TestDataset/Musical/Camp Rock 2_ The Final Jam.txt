{uplifting theme playing}
{dings}
{girl squeals}
GIRL:
Turn, turn. There's the sign.
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe
we're finally here.
Oh, wait. I told Shane I'd text
him once we're almost there.
Oh, Mitchie...
What?
Nothing, nothing.
Mom, obviously it's something.
I mean, you and subtle
aren't very good friends.
I know you and Shane talk all
the time, but, you know, it's...
You actually haven't seen
this boy in almost a year.
I just don't want you to be
too disappointed, honey,
if he can't come
to camp this summer.
Mom.
I want you to have fun
and focus on your music.
Okay, first off, this is goanna
be the best summer ever.
And second, nothing can make me
lose my focus.
What is that?
Did somebody open another camp?
{ominous theme playing}
{uplifting theme playing}
Seriously,
why would somebody open up
another camp across the lake?
Oh, who knows, but I don't think
it's anything to worry about.
Aah! Caitlyn!
Oh! Mitchie!
{sighs}
Hi! Aah!
Caitlyn!
How are you?
I'm great.
Let me take this for you.
Thank you.
I was so afraid that we weren't
goanna get here in time,
but doesn't look like
many are here.
Well, you know what this means.
Since we're the first ones here,
we totally get our choice of--
Bunk.
{all squealing}
{all chattering}
I bet you sounded
fantastic.
Yeah? Oh, my gosh.
Well, I guess no one cares
about my life.
What don't we know? I mean,
you update your status,
like, every two seconds.
Fine.
I have a question,
and it's for Mitchie.
For me?
So, what's going on
with you and Shane? Hm?
{all giggle}
Nothing is going on.
That's a total lie.
You guys are obsessed.
{all laugh}
No, seriously.
I don't know, I just...
I feel like if we never get
to spend any time together,
then nothing
is ever goanna happen.
{soft acoustic theme playing}
{grunting}
Just one more crank
and I think I got it.
{grunting}
That's good.
Can we please just wait
for the tow truck?
Oliver tried
and he couldn't get it.
Mm-hm.
That's because Oliver's
not properly motivated.
He's not trying to get
to Camp Rock before Mitchie.
We should have never taken
that shortcut.
Maybe because Oliver
doesn't even know Mitchie.
Thanks.
It's goanna be really cool.
I got it all planned.
She'll walk in, and I'll be
sitting there, and I'll say:
"Hey, Mitchie."
She's goanna be
so surprised.
"Hey, Mitchie"?
That's your big line?
Trust me.
Everything's cool when I do it.
I'm just excited to finally
spend some time with her.
Oh, here you go.
Is this from the tire?
Yeah. I saw it
on the ground before.
Thought it was important,
so I put it in my pocket.
Why didn't you
tell me this earlier?
How could I have told you
if I didn't remember until now?
It's fine.
Just one bolt, right?
We good?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
{wheel clatters}
{yelling}
Please.
No!
Oh! Please, don't.
No, no, no.
No!
No!
Oh!
No, no, no!
Oh!
Told you
it was important.
{mellow theme playing}
Where is everybody?
I know, right? There's, like,
barely anybody out there.
I sure hope you've got something
we can do at opening jam.
Because if not,
I've got nothing.
Kind of, maybe, sort of.
I don't know. I--
Can we hear it?
Sing it.
Uh, okay.
{all giggle}
It's not finished.
It's okay. Come on.
Not anything special.
ALL: Come on.
¶¶ Last year's old news ¶¶
¶¶ I'm breaking' out
My six-string ¶¶
¶¶ And playing' from my heart ¶¶
That is amazing.
I love it.
Really? Thank you.
That's all I got so far.
I have a lot of lyrics,
but the music's not really
worked out yet.
Maybe we could just sing the
first part over and over again.
{acoustic guitar playing
nearby}
That's it.
Really?
Nobody ever agrees with me.
{all laugh}
{playing soft music}
Barron! Sander!
Hey, what's up?
Hey.
Hi, how you doing?
Play it again.
For you, Mitchie? Anything.
Let's rock.

{all cheering}
Yeah! Whoo!
Yeah!
Yes, all right.
Mitchie Torres,
returning rocker. Yes!
Welcome to the heart and soul
of rock 'n' roll.
Whether you're slick and
happening or dark and jamming,
Camp Rock is the place to be,
yeah?
All right!
{all cheering}
Now, I'm sure you've noticed
that there aren't quite as many
of you as in years past.
But not to worry.
{horn honking}
{squeals}
Ooh.
Shane!
Sorry, she does that.
BROWN:
Rockers, my nephews,
and Camp Rock alum,
better known to the world
as Connect Three!
Hey.
{grunts}
{crowd gasps}
We probably shouldn't have
tied his shoes together.
He's the one who said he could
make anything look cool.
{squawks}
And I believe
he stands corrected.
Shane.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
{chuckles}
Surprise.
{chuckles}
All right.
They are goanna be with us
for the entire summer.
The whole summer?
Absolutely.
{chuckles}
The official reason being
they miss their uncle.
But I don't think
that's the entire story.
CROWD:
Ooh!
People are staring.
You might wanna do something,
like react or wave.
Hey, guys. I'm Shane.
This is Jason and Nate.
{crowd cheers}
We know it's goanna be hard,
but just treat us
like normal campers.
Wow, I guess it's not
goanna be that hard.
BROWN:
Yeah, as I was saying,
um, we're a little
smaller this year,
and that is courtesy of our
new friends across the lake,
Camp Star,
founded, not so coincidentally,
by my out-to-destroy-me,
still-mad-that-I-kicked-him
out-of-the-group
former bandmate,
Axel Turner.
Axel Turner?
The guy who owns Star Records?
He's across the lake?
Yes, and I share your disdain,
Tess. Thank you for that.
Now, it's goanna take
some effort,
but I'm sure we can all
peacefully co-exist on the lake,
yeah?
{dramatic theme playing}
We're under attack!
BOY:
Nice.
It's full of marshmallows.
This one has chocolate.
Whoa.
Graham crackers.
Camp Rock's invited
to an opening-night bonfire.
{all cheering}
No, no, no. Absolutely not. No.
ALL {chanting}:
Bonfire, bonfire, bonfire!
This is a setup.
For what I'm not sure.
Come on, Brown. It'll be fun.
You said yourself
we all need to get along, right?
And it's not just because
I haven't made dessert yet.
This is really good chocolate.
Isn't it?
{upbeat theme playing}
TESS:
One word: wow.
This isn't a camp,
i-it's a resort.
You say that
like it's a bad thing.
All right, I got it.
Oh, I don't got it.
I think we should add this
to the uncool list.
A little help--
A little help, please.
Thank you. Ah.
See,
these are the type of things
that you can't learn
over e-mail.
Maybe we should
go back to that.
Guys, I'm not kidding.
Line up and wait for me.
Junior rockers, I'm serious.
Please wait.
Hey, what's up, guys?
I remember when I used to be
a junior rocker.
I-Is that a camera, bud?
Don't touch it.
What, you think I'm goanna drop
it in the water?
And if you thought that,
I guess you'd be right.
You dropped it, Curly.
You swim for it.
Yeah. Um...
Brown, my man. Long time.
Hi, I'm Connie.
Hi.
Listen, Axel, I don't actually
know what your plan is--
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
A breath and a step.
I'm beginning to remember
why I left the band.
Left the band.
You l-- You left the band?
That is so rich. Is that what
you're telling people?
You, my friend, have got to stop
living in the past.
I'm trying to reach out
to you here.
Reach out? Reach out by driving
me out of business. I love it.
There's no reason why we both
can't be successful.
We both have our niche.
Niche?
Camp Star is dedicated
to producing
the superstars of tomorrow.
And, uh, what's your place
about again?
Encouraging kids
in their love of music, Axel.
Ah.
Like I said,
room for both of us.
Y-You know,
just to be clear,
he did not leave the band.
We kicked him out.
I know, I know.
It's okay.
We kicked him out.
SHANE:
Question: What do you say
you and I break away later
and I finally take you
on a first date?
Answer:
I'd like that.
MAN:
Check, check. One, two.
Check, check.
One, two. Check, check, check.
Wow.
I know, right?
That's all I've been saying
since I got off the boat.
Come on.
Ready?
We really shouldn't be here.
It's so obvious this guy's just
doing this to get back at Brown.
First, he tries to take down
the White Crows,
and now Camp Rock.
What is that?
Hot chocolate. They're handing
it out free when you walk in,
plus you get to keep the mug.
What?
There's no way I'm staying
at this bonfire.
Hey, pouty boy.
You better hurry.
The bonfire's
about to start.
You know, we should probably
go take our seats.
I think they're about to start.
Mm-hm.
Don't mock.
I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Okay, just a little bit.
Ah.
Look, they actually have
a real Wardrobe department
with incredible fabric.
And they let me make this.
Uh-oh. I think I just sewed
my scarf to my bra.
So I thought this was supposed
to be a campfire.
You know, singing,
telling stories, an actual fire.
Everybody have a seat.
{crowd cheering}
I'm Axel Turner.
And I'd like to welcome
all you rockers,
and my dear, old friend,
Brown Cesario--
Yeah, Brown! Whoo!
--to Camp Star!
{dramatic music playing}
Go, Brown!
But you all don't wanna hear
a speech from me.
You wanna get to what a campfire
is really all about:
singing.
Hey, that's what you just said.
You're twins. Ha-ha-ha!
So does anyone have anything
they'd like to play?
Camp Rockers, don't be shy.
{crowd chattering}
Well, we'll go,
if nobody else wants to.
{crowd cheering}
This song is about me
and a friend of mine.
{playing soft acoustic music}
¶¶ We're like a melody
With no words ¶¶
¶¶ Until we figure it out ¶¶
¶¶ We sing
"La, la, la, la, la, la" ¶¶
¶¶ I know it's simple, yeah
But it's worked ¶¶
¶¶ Right up till now ¶¶
¶¶ 'Cause up till now, yeah ¶¶
¶¶ Every day's been like
A dream world ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, but now you're not
Just in my head ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, no ¶¶
¶¶ Will we remember
Different summers? ¶¶
¶¶ It's like tossing your heart ¶¶
¶¶ To see where it lands ¶¶
¶¶ Heads is easy ¶¶
¶¶ Tails is harder to plan ¶¶
¶¶ If we're starting
All over again ¶¶
¶¶ And again and again ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, you know that I can't help
But wonder ¶¶
¶¶ What's goanna happen next ¶¶
¶¶ I'm a little curious ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, yeah ¶¶
¶¶ Every star
That I stood under ¶¶
¶¶ When you were under it too ¶¶
¶¶ Did you ever think about us? ¶¶
¶¶ I hope you did
'Cause I can tell you ¶¶
¶¶ That's something
I'll never forget ¶¶
¶¶ I won't forget ¶¶
¶¶ If we remember
Different summers ¶¶
¶¶ It's like tossing your heart ¶¶
¶¶ To see where it lands ¶¶
¶¶ Heads is easy ¶¶
¶¶ Tails is harder to plan ¶¶
¶¶ If we're starting
All over again ¶¶
¶¶ Only friends ¶¶
¶¶ Just beginning ¶¶
¶¶ But I hope
That we find it again ¶¶
¶¶ So we can
Go from here ¶¶
¶¶ Oh ¶¶
¶¶ Will we remember
Different summers? ¶¶
¶¶ It's like tossing your heart ¶¶
¶¶ To see where it lands ¶¶
¶¶ Heads is easy ¶¶
¶¶ Tails is harder to plan ¶¶
¶¶ If we're starting
All over again ¶¶
¶¶ Oh-oh ¶¶
¶¶ Again and again
And again and again ¶¶
¶¶ Again and again and again ¶¶
¶¶ Will we remember
Different summers? ¶¶
{crowd cheering}
Whoo!
That was sweet.
But I guess it's time
for Camp Star to answer.
And, heh, my apologies
if we embarrass ourselves.
We-- We're kind of new at this.
{hip-hop music playing}
¶¶ Nobody's goanna wanna
Get next to me ¶¶
¶¶ 'Cause they know ¶¶
¶¶ They know ¶¶
¶¶ I take what's mine
And won't let it go ¶¶
¶¶ Doesn't matter
How you approach the scene ¶¶
¶¶ Just hope ¶¶
¶¶ Just hope ¶¶
¶¶ You're everything and more
When you hit the door ¶¶
¶¶ I dare you
To challenge me ¶¶
¶¶ You'll be begging
For mercy, please ¶¶

Ow! Oh.
Nate, are you okay?
{crowd cheering}
MAN:
You guys rock!
{all cheering}
And that's how we do things here
at Camp Star!
Wow.
{Axel chuckling}
Uh, before we go any further,
I'd like to make a quick
announcement.
We're having staffing problems.
Who knew we'd be so popular?
All right,
now we're under attack.
So I'd just like
to put it out there.
If there are any Camp Rock
counsellors or staff
who'd like to make the switch,
I'd be more than willing
to double your salary.
You've gotta be joking. I barely
have enough staff as it is.
I'll go.
What?
No.
And, if there are any Camp Rock
campers who'd like to join us,
well, I'm sure we can
find you a bunk.
Oh, did I mention
our cabins are air-conditioned?
He can't do this.
Right.
I need all the Camp Rockers
back on the boats now. Come on.
Go, please.
Come on, guys.
Back to the boats.
Let's go. Come on.
Are you sure it's okay?
Not a scratch.
I'm really sorry
about that.
Oh, it's all good.
I'm totally fine.
I'm just happy
I could catch it for you.
Well, it's always
kind of been my lucky charm.
I guess it still works.
Did you forget the part
where you hit him in the eye?
I'll be over there.
So, Dana,
you were amazing up there.
You think?
I'm just glad it's finally over.
We've been practicing for weeks,
and still,
every time I go on,
I'm almost sure
I'm goanna throw up.
I'm really glad you guys came.
My dad was totally sure
none of you would show.
My dad's Axel Turner.
He's your dad?
{mouthing words}
Heh. Everybody says that,
and kind of exactly like that,
but trust me,
once you get to know him,
he's a really great guy.
Well, I-I guess I should go.
Here.
You don't wanna lose it.
You can keep it if you want.
What would I do with a bracelet?
Right.
For the record,
I'm glad you're okay.
You have really pretty eyes.
Ah. Sorry, that was weird.
I didn't mean to make you
uncomfortable.
No, it's all good. People tell
me that all the time.
Um, probably because
they're right
in the middle of my face, so...
Uh-huh.
So... Heh. What--?
Um...
I'll see you around.
Okay.
Yes, I wanna keep it, you have
pretty eyes too. Stupid.
I'm an idiot.
Ha.
Something we both
can agree on.
Ow. Strong idiot.
I...
I don't want you
talking to that boy.
Don't worry, I don't think
it's goanna be a problem.
Okay, come on.
Rockers, boats now.
{scoffs}
Wow.
Now, this is a recording studio.
Hey.
Um...
Hi.
Can I help you with something?
Do I look like I need help?
Heh. Do I know you?
That's funny. I'm Luke.
Luke Williams.
I was just on-stage,
like two minutes ago.
¶¶ I'm giving you the fire ¶¶
{vocalizing}
Wow, impressive.
I know, right?
It's kind of my thing.
So you thinking about
joining us over here?
Uh, no, I'm perfectly happy
where I am.
Well, you are Shane Gray's
girlfriend, so...
Wait, what does Shane--?
How do you even know that?
You have to know the players
if you wanna be in the game,
right?
No.
It's a tough business.
It's summer camp.
To you, but to anybody
at Camp Star,
it's step one to a long
and illustrious career.
I don't have time
for second rate.
We're not second rate.
You don't have to get
all defensive.
It's none of my business,
you don't have to try
to convince me.
I'm not trying
to do anything.
Good. You're at the perfect
place for you.
Look, just so we're clear,
Luke "I'm giving you the fire"
Williams,
or whatever your name is,
not one Camp Rocker,
not in a million years,
would ever even think
about coming over
to this narcissistic,
over-produced ego factory.
Guess what? My mom said yes.
I get to make the switch.
That's great.
Welcome to the ego factory.
Thanks.
Tess, how could you?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I feel horrible, but...
{laughing}
Who am I kidding?
I am so excited,
I can't even pretend
to be sympathetic.
That was great
what you did up there.
¶¶ I'm giving you the fire ¶¶
So impressive.
I know, right?
Wow.
Good luck trying to find
a spotlight
big enough
for the both of you.
{scoffs}
{birds chirping}
{soft theme playing}
{all chattering}
No, you guys,
it's goanna be okay.
I mean, Brown's a smart guy,
he can figure something out.
Thanks for that vote
of confidence, Mitchie.
Guess I don't have to get
everyone's attention.
So the good news is,
and this really warms my heart,
we lost very few campers
last night.
{crowd cheers}
That's right.
But we did lose quite a few
of our remaining staff.
Which means,
and I can't believe
I have to say this,
Camp Rock is closed,
effective immediately.
GIRL: Wait, what?
BOY: No.
Y-You have to believe me,
I-I truly--
I've got no other option.
I'll start calling parents
as soon as we're done here,
which I guess is now.
I'm sorry.
Brown, wait. Guys.
Camp is over?
But we just got here.
It's not his fault.
I mean, there's nothing
he can do about it.
GIRL:
Man, this is such a bummer.
But...
that doesn't mean there isn't
something we can do about it.
Mitchie.
No, I'm serious.
This is our summer,
and we're not giving up.
We're not backing down.
GIRL: Right.
I don't know, Mitchie.
¶¶ We can't
We can't back down ¶¶
ALL:
¶¶ We can't
We can't back down ¶¶
¶¶ We can't
We can't back down ¶¶
¶¶ We can't
We can't back down ¶¶
¶¶ Not right now
We can't back down ¶¶
¶¶ Not right now
We can't back down ¶¶
¶¶ We can't back down ¶¶
¶¶ Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah ¶¶
¶¶ Don't close your eyes ¶¶
¶¶ We're all in this together ¶¶
¶¶ Wherever they draw the line ¶¶
¶¶ We're not goanna straddle
We'll cross it ¶¶
¶¶ Or lose it ¶¶
ALL:
¶¶ We can't back down
There's too much at stake ¶¶
¶¶ This is serious
Don't walk away ¶¶
¶¶ We can't pretend
It's not happening ¶¶
¶¶ In our own backyard
Our own home plate ¶¶
¶¶ We've been called out ¶¶
¶¶ We've been called out ¶¶
¶¶ Do you hear your name? ¶¶
¶¶ Yeah ¶¶
¶¶ I'm not confused
Let's win this thing ¶¶
¶¶ We can't back down
There's too much at stake ¶¶

BROWN:
What's going on?
Well, you said you needed
some new counsellors, so...
I found you some.
Then it looks like I should call
this staff meeting to order.
Yes.
Thank you.
BOY: Yes.
GIRL: All right.
GIRL:
Come on, Terry.
No, nada. Guys,
I already told you,
I'm not goanna be doing this.
Jason, you're looking
at this all wrong.
This isn't punishment.
It's a reward.
Really?
Really.
This just means
that everybody thinks
that you have
the leadership skills,
the maturity,
the intelligence--
You think I'm intelligent?
No.
--and the sheer guts
to take on this challenge.
Wow, you're good.
Thank you.
You're right.
This is an honour.
Exactly. Now, get in there
and make us proud.
We'll be right here
if you need us.
{children squealing}
All right.
Run.
Run.
Hi, everybody. I'm Jason.
I'm goanna be your counsellor.
I'm a little new at this
so I thought you guys
would go a little bit
easier on me.
What do you say?
I say, let's get him.
ALL: Yeah!
Guys, guys, hold on a minute.
Now get him.
No, no, no.
No, no, no. No.
{all yelling}
{upbeat pop music playing}
All right, let's dance.
Sorry.
{children clamouring}
All good?
ALL: All good.
Let's do this.
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
Here we go, guys. All right.
Circle, down.
Head, meet, out.
Louder.
{all singing scales}
Awesome.
Got a colour that looks good
with his eye colour.
What about this, girls? Right?
Hi.
{children squealing}
{groans}
Enough.
Do you wanna rock?
Well, you know what?
You don't deserve to rock.
Why should I show you the first
thing about being a rock star,
if you don't wanna show me
any respect?
Well, okay, then.
Who wants to play the drums?
Who wants to play the guitar?
Who wants to be a lead singer?
Well, you are goanna
have to buy tighter pants
and learn how to play
a tambourine.
I heard that.
JASON: Sorry.
{whispers}:
It's true.
{piano playing in distance}
{ducks quacking}
Nate?
Yeah.
Shane. What's up, bro?
What are you doing?
Um, lifeguard duty.
Schedule's a mess,
but you can't be too careful.
Just one last look.
All clear.
So, what do I have to do to pull
you away from this clipboard?
Mitchie,
I just rolled 100 pounds
of raw hamburger all by myself.
I told you, honey,
I needed help.
No, no, no, that--
That's impossible.
I know for a fact
that I scheduled--
Absolutely nobody. I'm so sorry.
What's going on?
This isn't working.
The kitchen is a disaster.
Yesterday, I ordered 50 pounds
of black beans
and they delivered
Well, you gotta admit, Mom,
you don't have the best
handwriting.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, it's rock 'n' roll, right?
It's goanna be
a little chaotic.
I think you're doing great.
We'll just make
some adjustments
to the schedule, yeah?
Perfect. Shane,
help Connie with the hamburgers.
Actually, I've--
I've got this thing--
Oh, really?
Well, come on, pretty boy.
No, but--
{laughing}
{playing steady beat}
All right, that's it.
Now pick it up.
Bring it home.
I knew you could do it.
All right, now it's, uh,
getting a little late,
so what do you say
we all go enjoy some free time?
ALL: Yeah.
BOY: All right.
{soft theme playing}
Hey, man.
Oh.
What are you doing?
Why does everybody
keep doing that?
Sorry, we're just doing our part
as activity directors.
And what's the activity today?
Wakeboarding.
{laughing}
No!
Oh!
{soft theme playing}
{grunts}
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm great.
{sighs}
Uh, don't suppose
you came over here
to see anyone
in particular.
No,
just getting some exercise.
Do you play a lot of sports?
Canoeing.
That's pretty much it.
I'm really
not all that sporty either.
I played soccer when I was
little, but who doesn't?
I don't know if it counts
as a sport,
but I'd kind of love
to be a dancer.
It's like my nerdy secret,
"if I could be anything,
that's what I'd be" wish.
What would you be?
I don't know.
Never thought about it.
Probably because if you could
be anything, you'd be you.
{both chuckling}
Uh, do you wanna hear something
really stupid?
I was goofing around,
and I accidentally sort of
wrote your name on my hand
but used permanent ink
by mistake.
No one's ever written my name
on their hand before.
Really more my wrist.
Heh.
Dana--
Yeah?
AXEL:
Dana?
Oh, it's my dad.
I'm so sorry, I'm not supposed
to be talking to you.
Hurry. Go.
AXEL:
Dana?
Dana.
Hey.
I saw this canoe.
Ugh. Don't touch it,
it's one of theirs.
I'll have an attendant
fish it out.
What's that on your wrist?
Nothing.
You wanna know what I wanna be?
The kind of guy who can tell you
how he really feels.
I hate canoes.
{upbeat theme playing}
I'm still an idiot.
I still agree.
Dude,
you can't keep hitting me.
Thank you.
{footsteps approaching}
Oh!
{Mitchie giggling}
SHANE:
Ow.
Thanks, Mitchie.
I had absolutely
the best day ever.
Everything's finally
starting to work out.
That's great.
It's all because of you.
No, it's because of us.
Now that everybody else
has gotten your time,
I think I'm goanna demand
some of my own.
It hasn't been that bad.
The whole reason I'm here,
the reason my brothers are here,
is so I can
get to know you better.
It's only been like two seconds.
And that is
the sweetest thing
that anybody has ever
said to me.
But...
But--
BARRON {over PA}:
Now a word from
your friendly
neighbourhood announcer.
Will the counsellors
scheduled for the bonfire
please report to the mess hall.
But you gotta go.
But we gotta go.
Are you coming?
No, it's cool. I'll catch up.
Shane.
Go, they need you.
Okay.
{guitar playing soft music}
Hey. I'm impressed.
Ehh.
You seem to be doing
much better with them.
It took
a little bit of time,
but I think I finally gained
their respect.
{whispering indistinctly}
{laughing}
Who glued me to this log?
{all laughing}
{singsong}:
Log Butt, Log Butt.
We're goanna call you Log Butt.
You know what's worse
than being called Log Butt?
Is being sat on by Log Butt.
Oh! Ooh!
BROWN:
Run. Run, he's got you.
Come back here.
Fireflies.
I'm goanna get this one.
Okay, catch them, everybody.
Let's jump. Jump.
{chuckling}
{suspenseful theme playing}
Looks like the Lord of the Flies
over there.
There's no way they're goanna
make it through the summer.
I remember doing that.
It's fun.
Don't even think about it.
{sighs}
It felt so great just standing
up in front of that class today.
I feel like there's
nothing we can't do.
Pleats.
Still can't do pleats.
Wish we had that attitude
the other night at Camp Star.
Yeah, I so wanted
to show them up.
That hardly counted. They'd been
planning that for weeks.
Yeah, and now they're all
walking around
thinking they're better than us.
PEGGY:
So not true.
You know, I'd really like to see
them go up against us.
BARRON:
Yeah.
CAITLYN:
If we had time
to get it together,
no way they'd stand a chance.
Like in Final Jam.
There's just no way.
Lot of big talk.
Wanna see if it's true?
{mellow theme playing}
It's about time.
My private vocal lessons
started ten minutes ago.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot that Axel thinks
you need the extra rehearsal.
ALL {chanting}:
Camp Rock.
Camp Rock.
Camp Rock.
Camp Rock.
Camp Rock.
Camp Rock.
Camp Rock. Ooh.
Yeah, that's right.
We're here on your stage.
See, you guys didn't really
give us a chance
to answer back
the other night.
But guess what?
That's goanna change.
Camp Rock vs. Camp Star,
the Final Jam.
What do you guys think
about that?
Drums.
{playing steady beat}
A little guitar, please.
{playing upbeat music}

{crowd cheering}
That is a fantastic idea.
Truly. I'm impressed.
A little healthy competition
is exactly what we need.
A champion always needs
a good sparring partner.
We do?
But you really think
that you can,
uh, take my guys on
head-to-head?
{scoffs}
Anytime, anyplace.
GIRL: Yup.
BOY: Yeah.
Can't wait.
Maybe use our amphitheatre.
Doesn't matter where.
We just know that Camp Rock
is goanna blow you guys away.
GIRL: That's right.
BOY: Straight up.
I'm sure an audience
would be a better judge of that.
Bring it on. You can pack it
with anybody you want.
{chuckles}
Well,
how about a worldwide audience?
What if we put this little
competition on TV?
Have the public decide
who's really the best.
TV? We'd really get to be on TV?
Uh, I don't really know
about this.
Not such a big talker now,
are you?
{Camp Star chuckles}
But that would be so cool.
The whole world would see us.
Uh...
SANDER:
Come on, Mitchie.
This could be huge.
BOY:
Yeah, let's do it.
You're on.
Whoo!
Yeah.
{all cheering}
I wrote this song
a long time ago
and I kind of
forgot about it,
but I think it could work.
It's a duet.
Now. But I think
I could rewrite it
and make a part for everybody.
Or we can rewrite it.
"I lay pretty, pretty flowers
on your grave."
Am I the only one who thinks
this song is, like,
totally depressing?
{clears throat}
You're on the wrong page.
Yeah, that song
was for my hamster's funeral.
Oh, this is perfect.
The staging
could be pretty cool.
Yeah, it looks like there's some
great spots for dancing.
And it's got a great groove.
Well, before we get ahead
of ourselves, guys,
I got a couple conditions.
You've got conditions?
Yes. Well, a condition.
There has to be a spot
for my junior rockers.
Of course. That's what
this is all about.
So, what do you guys think?
ALL:
I'm in. Let's do it.
I think somebody should talk
to Uncle Brown.
Why? I already know
what he's goanna say.
How could she do that?
I told them.
I told Mitchie Axel Turner
cannot be trusted.
I don't know why
you're getting so upset.
At the very least, Camp Rock
could get some great exposure.
He took advantage
is what he did.
He saw an opportunity
and went for it.
An opportunity to destroy me
once and for all.
And I thought Mitchie
could be dramatic.
Okay, then, just call him
and say no.
It's not that big a deal.
Oh, we're well past
big deal.
Look. "Camp Wars." Catchy.
Yeah, I especially
like the tagline,
"Only one will survive."
Millions of viewers will be
watching. That's good, right?
After this,
we are done.
And not just for the summer,
for good.
Oh, come on. Brown.
Give them a chance.
BROWN:
Look, nobody believes
in my rockers more than I do,
but we are goanna look like
a joke next to Camp Star.
We don't have the resources,
the infrastructure, the money.
Talent, passion, commitment,
yeah, we've got that.
It's not goanna matter.
It always matters.
And when people watch,
where do you think they're goanna
send their kids to camp?
CONNIE:
She didn't do it on purpose.
BROWN:
I know.
I just wish she wouldn't have
fallen into the trap.
{footsteps retreating}
{upbeat theme playing}
SANDER {over PA}:
Good morning, Camp Rock.
A message from Mitchie Torres:
All rockers, please report
to the main stage immediately.
Yeah, that means you.
Get moving.
All right, rockers. There are
new schedules out on the board.
From this moment on,
everything is about winning
the competition.
Everything. We have to be
completely focused.
What about swimming
and waterskiing and--?
Focus. Sorry.
{feedback whining}
Oh, sorry again.
Seriously, you guys,
if we wanna save this camp,
we have to put
all of our energies into this
and make it the best performance
that any of us have ever put on.
I mean, we may have
our doubters,
but we have come way too far
just to back down. Agreed?
ALL:
Agreed.
All right.
Now, let's go get to work.
Now.
{feedback whines}
{all chattering}
I don't know what to do
about this set,
but it's just gotta be big.
Think of the biggest thing
you can imagine
and then make it bigger.
All right.
Thanks.
Mitchie, we're moving
in the wrong direction.
There's even less time on this
than the last one.
Um, I've got a few minutes now.
That's not what I mean.
Mitchie,
can you look at this?
I want us to coordinate,
but not be all matchy-matchy.
Mitchie-- Hi, Shane.
Hi.
CAITLYN:
I know you're rewriting,
but we've gotta make some
decisions about the music.
Mitchie, can I talk to you?
Do you know who's doing
the vocal arrangements?
If it's me, fine,
but somebody's gotta tell me.
{sighs}
I'm sorry.
{tense theme playing}
{piano playing in distance}
I don't even know
why I'm here.
Take my advice
and never get a girlfriend.
I don't think
that'll be a problem.
{playing soft music}
{tender theme playing}
{laughing}
Hey, what are you guys doing?
I thought you were
goanna be rehearsing.
Whoa, calm down. We've been
rehearsing for over five hours.
We're just taking
a little break.
Really?
Because I was watching,
and it looks like we're goanna
need a lot more work.
{both laughing}
You guys done already?
No.
He was telling me
about his sister.
It's hilarious.
You have to tell her.
Oh, is it the one
about the group of kids
that didn't take
their jobs seriously
and then the camp shut down?
Yeah, I think I've heard it.
Hey, Mitchie. You gotta check
out this bit
me and the J.R.'s worked out.
It's a real spotlight moment.
That's great.
I'm sure whatever it is,
it's just goanna have to be
more of a background moment.
Sander, what's going on?
You guys haven't made
any progress
since I left like
half an hour ago.
You guys have
to get this thing built.
You guys have to work
with me.
If I wanted to go to Camp Star
I would have signed up.
Okay, that's not fair.
I'm just trying
to get stuff done,
but if you guys don't care--
Mitchie.
We all care,
but you gotta lighten up.
Really?
And what will that get us?
All right, okay.
Let's do it again.
That girl is taking the F-U-N
out of summer.
There is no F-U-N
in summer.
Exactly.
Seriously, I love her,
but I'm goanna kill her.
Okay, I think you know
what you've gotta do.
I'm on it.
{all shouting}
Guys, guys, calm down.
She didn't say no,
she said she'd think about it.
All work and no spray
makes a very unhappy rocker.
So I got a proposition
for you guys.
You think you're up for it?
Okay, we have a ton of stuff
to go over.
Where is everybody?
{sighs}
Seriously, people have got
to start being on time.
{kids shouting}
Attack!
{rock music playing}
Oh, this was not
on the schedule.
Are you kidding? This is what
summer camp is all about.
Counterattack!
{laughs}
Come on!
{all laughing and shouting}
Come on, then.
BOY 1: I know.
GIRL: It's so high.
BOY 2: Look at that.
BOY 3: That's a lot of fire.
So fun today.
Today was so awesome.
Yeah.
Has anybody seen Mitchie?
Um, I don't know.
She missed dinner.
Okay, thanks.
Look at our fire.
{laughs}
{door opens}
{door closes}
Your sheet music's soggy.
Just pouring myself
into my music.
{chuckles}
That was bad.
Yeah, I know.
Um...
Are you here to help?
I can't.
Why?
Because you and I are going
on a moonlight picnic.
Now?
Right now.
How could you--
Because I'm that nice
of a guy.
--think that I would just
go running off?
Are you saying no?
Do you not understand everything
that needs to get done?
How could I not?
You remind me every two seconds.
And the water-balloon fight.
I mean, what were you thinking?
I was thinking, "Wouldn't it be
nice to have a little fun?"
So you're saying I'm not fun?
Why do I even keep trying?
The whole reason I came
was because--
I know. It was to get
to know me better.
Well, guess what.
This is me
trying to save something
that I care about.
So am I.
Really?
And how's that working out
for you?
Not so great.
Shane.
You forgot your flashlight.
{playing soft music}
¶¶ It's like he doesn't hear
A word I say ¶¶

¶¶ Like fire and rain ¶¶
¶¶ You can drive me insane ¶¶
¶¶ You can drive me insane ¶¶
BOTH:
¶¶ But I can't stay mad at you
For anything ¶¶
¶¶ We're Venus and Mars ¶¶
¶¶ We're Venus and Mars ¶¶
¶¶ We're like different stars ¶¶
¶¶ Like different stars ¶¶
¶¶ You're the harmony
To every song I sing ¶¶
¶¶ And I wouldn't change
A thing ¶¶
¶¶ When I'm yes, she's no ¶¶
¶¶ When I hold on
He just lets go ¶¶
BOTH:
¶¶ We're perfectly imperfect ¶¶
¶¶ But I wouldn't change
A thing, no ¶¶
¶¶ We're like fire and rain ¶¶
¶¶ Like fire and rain ¶¶
¶¶ You can drive me insane ¶¶
¶¶ You can drive me insane ¶¶

{mellow theme playing}
Where is everybody?
{sighs}
PEGGY:
All right, now let's look at
the alto harmony on measure 15.
There's a four-bar rest.
Good morning.
Morning.
Oh, hold on.
What's going on?
You were right.
It shouldn't be all up to you.
And we do need
to step it up.
Shane got everybody up
before dawn.
He can be pretty persuasive
when he wants to be.
Morning. Sleep well?
I don't think you got
the new arrangement yet.
Needed a lot of work.
You did this?
We all did.
ALL:
Yeah.
I already know
I'm goanna love it.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
All right,
let's get started.
We gotta rock this stage
like we own it, right?
{plays short beat}
Now, I can hear you,
but I gotta see you play.
Nate, show them how it's done.
Like this.
Excellent.
Jason, show them how to rock.
Okay, guys, not like this:
But like this:
{strumming}
{all strumming}
Good job.
Well, it's easy for you guys,
but we're not all
rock stars.
But you can be.
{all cheering and applauding}
{playing upbeat rock music}
¶¶ Oh ¶¶
¶¶ Yeah ¶¶
¶¶ All right ¶¶
¶¶ Mm-hm-hm ¶¶
¶¶ Gather round, guys
It's time to start listening' ¶¶
¶¶ Practice makes perfect
But perfect's not working' ¶¶
¶¶ There's a lot more to music ¶¶
¶¶ Than knowing where
Your cue's goanna be ¶¶
¶¶ You can play
All the right notes ¶¶
¶¶ But that don't mean
You're moving me ¶¶
¶¶ But if you can jump
Like David Lee Roth ¶¶
¶¶ Or pump your fist
Like you're Bruce the Boss ¶¶
¶¶ If you got heart and soul ¶¶
¶¶ You can rock 'n' roll ¶¶
¶¶ Rock 'n' roll ¶¶
¶¶ Strum it, drum it
Slide across and run it ¶¶
¶¶ The stage is your home
If you learn how to own it ¶¶
¶¶ Like the greats did ¶¶
¶¶ There's no way
That you can fake it ¶¶
¶¶ You've gotta feel the beat
Before you can move ¶¶
¶¶ Even though you're not wearing
Blue suede shoes ¶¶
¶¶ And making' mistakes
Well, that won't matter ¶¶
¶¶ If you can swagger
Like you're Mick Jagger ¶¶
¶¶ If you've got heart and soul ¶¶
¶¶ You can rock 'n' roll ¶¶
¶¶ You can rock 'n' roll ¶¶
¶¶ Whoo, solo ¶¶
¶¶ If you live and die
For the music inside ¶¶
¶¶ If the one-four-five
Never gets old ¶¶
¶¶ Then you can rock 'n' roll ¶¶
¶¶ Rock 'n' roll ¶¶
¶¶ All right, now, take it low ¶¶
¶¶ Now, I need the spotlight
To hit me right here ¶¶
¶¶ As the crowd starts to cheer ¶¶
¶¶ I need the fan to blow
Right through ¶¶
¶¶ My rock-star hair ¶¶
¶¶ Right here ¶¶
¶¶ If you can scream
Like Axl Rose ¶¶
¶¶ Or sing like Christina
Show after show ¶¶
¶¶ If you've got heart and soul ¶¶
¶¶ You can rock 'n' roll ¶¶
¶¶ Yeah ¶¶
¶¶ If you've got heart and soul ¶¶
¶¶ You can rock 'n' roll ¶¶
¶¶ You can rock 'n' roll ¶¶
¶¶ Ooh ¶¶
¶¶ Yeah ¶¶
¶¶ You can rock 'n' roll ¶¶
{all cheering}
¶¶ Oh ¶¶
¶¶ Yeah ¶¶
¶¶ All right ¶¶
Hi, Nate.
{grunts}
Oh, I-- I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
Hi, Dana.
What are you doing here?
What do you think?
You came to see me?
Good guess.
Well, here I am.
{laughs}
That's it?
I came all the way over here
in a canoe
risking my father's wrath,
and that's all
you have to say to me?
I don't know what else
I'm supposed to say.
There's nothing
you're supposed to say.
Every day I see you looking
and waving and I'm all,
"That's so sweet.
I so like him."
You do? Really, that's--
That's what you say?
But then--
"But then"?
Ah. That's never good.
How do I really know
if I don't know anything
about you?
I guess I just thought
you were different.
I am different.
No, you're not.
You're exactly like every other
teenage boy in the world.
Have you ever told me anything
about yourself?
You know, other than
you like canoeing.
Well, I don't really
like canoeing.
Oh. Oh, good.
So I really know nothing
about you.
I still don't know
what I'm supposed to say.
I think you just did.
{sighs}
{soft pop music playing}
¶¶ Words don't come easy ¶¶
Idiot.
¶¶ Without a melody ¶¶
¶¶ I'm always thinking' ¶¶
¶¶ In terms of do-re-mi ¶¶
¶¶ I should be hiking' ¶¶
¶¶ Swimming' ¶¶
¶¶ Laughing' with you ¶¶
¶¶ Instead I'm all
Out of tune ¶¶
Special order.
¶¶ But what you don't know ¶¶
¶¶ You lift me
Off of the ground ¶¶
¶¶ Your inspiration ¶¶
{inaudible dialogue}
¶¶ You help me find my sound ¶¶
¶¶ Just like a bass line
In half time ¶¶
¶¶ You hold down the groove ¶¶
¶¶ That's why I'm counting'
On you ¶¶
DUO:
¶¶ And when I hear you
On the radio ¶¶
¶¶ I never want to change
a single note ¶¶
¶¶ It's what I tried to say
All along ¶¶
¶¶ You're my favourite song ¶¶
¶¶ My favourite song ¶¶
¶¶ And when I hear you
On the radio ¶¶
¶¶ Yeah ¶¶
¶¶ I never want to change
A single note ¶¶
¶¶ No, no ¶¶
¶¶ It's what I tried to say
All along ¶¶
¶¶ You're my favourite song ¶¶
¶¶ You're my favourite song ¶¶
{sighs}
I take back what I said
about girlfriends.
It's all good, because at this
rate, I'll never have one.
What do you mean?
Well, there's this girl.
I kind of figured.
I really like her,
but I'm having a hard time
telling her
how I really feel.
You're a rock star, dude.
Use it.
I don't think she cares.
She just wants to know all this
stupid, random stuff about me.
It's not random stuff.
She just wants to know
you care enough
to let her know
who you are.
Well, I care.
But I just don't know
how to say it.
Well, if you can't say it,
you can sing it.
{mellow theme playing}
{suspenseful theme playing}
Every single time
I'm trying to sing my high note,
I keep getting lost
behind her big head.
Oh, no, you didn't.
You couldn't stand
the spotlight.
TESS:
Now that you mention,
I'm not trying to do anything.
AXEL:
Enough!
We'll run it again
in three minutes.
And this time, remember,
it's not amateur hour.
He means you.
Hi, Dana.
Oh!
Kind of makes you jump,
doesn't it?
You shouldn't be here.
I know,
but I couldn't wait.
Wait for what?
It's a list of things
that nobody knows about me.
Two minutes.
I really gotta go.
I'm sorry.
Wait. We still have
two minutes.
Okay.
{playing soft music}
¶¶ I'm
I'm good at wasting time ¶¶
¶¶ I think lyrics
Need to rhyme ¶¶
¶¶ And you're not asking' ¶¶
¶¶ But I'm trying' to grow
A mustache ¶¶
¶¶ I eat cheese
But only on pizza, please ¶¶
¶¶ And sometimes
On a homemade quesadilla ¶¶
¶¶ Otherwise it smells
Like feet to me ¶¶
¶¶ And I, I really like it
When the moon ¶¶
¶¶ Looks like a toenail ¶¶
¶¶ And I love it when you say
My name ¶¶
Places, everybody. Come on.
¶¶ If you wanna know
Here it goes ¶¶
¶¶ Gonna tell you
There's a part of me ¶¶
¶¶ That shows if we're close ¶¶
¶¶ Gonna let you
See everything ¶¶
¶¶ But remember that you asked
For it ¶¶
¶¶ I'll try to do my best
To impress ¶¶
¶¶ But it's easier to let you
Take a guess at the rest ¶¶
¶¶ But you wanna hear what lives
In my brain and my heart ¶¶
¶¶ Well, you asked for it ¶¶
¶¶ For your perusing
At times confusing ¶¶
¶¶ Slightly amusing ¶¶

STAGE MANAGER:
Come on, get a move on!
We don't have all day!
¶¶ I never trust a dog
To watch my food ¶¶
¶¶ And I like to use
The word "dude" ¶¶
¶¶ As a noun or an adverb
Or an adjective ¶¶
¶¶ And I
I never really been into cars ¶¶
¶¶ I like really cool guitars
And superheroes ¶¶
¶¶ And checks with lots of zeros
On 'em ¶¶

¶¶ And making' someone smile ¶¶
¶¶ If you wanna know
Here it goes ¶¶

To show if we're close ¶¶

¶¶ For your perusing
At times confusing ¶¶
¶¶ Possibly amusing ¶¶
¶¶ Introducing me ¶¶
¶¶ Well, you probably know
More than you ever wanted to ¶¶
¶¶ So be careful when you ask
Next time ¶¶
AXEL:
Dana!
¶¶ So if you wanna know
Here it goes ¶¶
¶¶ Gonna tell you there's a part
Of me to show if we're close ¶¶

Dana. Everyone's waiting.
Sorry. It's my fault.
Why don't you save the theatrics
for the competition?
It's okay.
Go.
Thank you.
We'll talk about this later.
{acoustic theme playing}
And all that was left
was a bloody footprint.
{gasps}
Lame.
Not even scary.
Yeah, totally
not scary at all.
Okay, time for bed.
Turn on the lights.
But you called
"lights out."
I know what I called.
What was that?
{all laugh}
Jason, do you think
we're goanna win?
Yeah, Jason.
BOY:
Do you think we're goanna win?
Of course we're goanna win.
You guys are rock stars.
But what if they are too?
I guess I really
didn't think about that.
Good night.
{soft theme playing}
{mischievous theme playing}
Everybody up.
JASON:
Shh.
Follow my lead.
We're on a mission.
{suspenseful theme playing}
Okay, guys, stay low. Roll.
Oh! Oh, a rock!
Ow, ow, ow!
Okay. Don't roll.
Okay, gently, guys.
Come on, carefully.
Single file.
Slow. Careful.
Come on. Shh.
Guys, come on.
{hip-hop music playing}
JASON:
Go, go.
¶¶ You can play a song
Almost any groove ¶¶
¶¶ We can break it down
Break it down ¶¶
¶¶ Hey ¶¶
¶¶ You can play a song
When you see me move ¶¶
¶¶ Make you turn around
Turn around ¶¶
¶¶ Oh-ooh-oh

¶¶ I'm goanna take you ¶¶
¶¶ I'm goanna shake you ¶¶
¶¶ No one's goanna lose ¶¶
¶¶ Walking' in my shoes ¶¶
¶¶ When the lights come on
You can feel the heat ¶¶
¶¶ Then I'll hit the floor
Hit the floor, ooh ¶¶
¶¶ When the curtain's up
I fly on my feet ¶¶
¶¶ You'll be wanting' more
Wanting' more, ohhh ¶¶
¶¶ Oh-ooh-oh ¶¶

¶¶ Walking' in my shoes ¶¶
¶¶ Hey ¶¶
Well?
Good.
Maybe great.
But this competition
isn't about maybe.
Okay, fine. But can you tell
her to stay out of my light?
Well, maybe if you would
stay out of my way,
it wouldn't
be a problem.
Let me see "Tear it Down"
instead.
{all groan}
AXEL: Let's reset, people.
Come on. Move!
This has to be perfect.
Camp Rock isn't goanna know
what hit them.
{all chattering}
And the stage was, like,
super-cool.
It's huge.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold up.
Wait, so it's just
Tess and Luke singing?
Yeah, pretty much. Everybody
else is doing something,
but they're definitely
the stars.
But this makes it
so much easier.
We could totally win
this thing.
How so?
Oh, come on.
Even I get it.
I don't care
what they're singing,
but you and Shane are better
than Tess and Luke any day.
But Shane and I
aren't even singing together.
But you originally
wrote the song as a duet.
I know, but I--
You're our two
strongest singers.
And we know
you have chemistry.
It's just,
everybody worked so hard.
Yeah, to help save the camp.
If the two of you singing alone
on-stage can help us win,
you have to do it.
Then it's settled.
ALL:
Yeah!
{melancholy theme playing}
Remember when Audrey
jumped on Jason?
Man, the shaving cream
was the best one.
You guys okay
with just Shane and I singing?
Yeah, we're good.
I was just looking forward
to doing some of my new moves.
But it's okay,
if it means we get to come back
here next summer.
You guys had a good summer?
Only the best summer ever.
{Mitchie laughing}
You guys just gave me
the best idea ever.
Ew!
Thank you!
Hey, guys, new plan.
Everyone meet in ten minutes.
Hello, and welcome to Hitz TV.
I'm Georgina Farlow.
And today we're bringing you
Camp Wars,
the ultimate summer-camp
showdown.
Now, there can be only
one winner this Final Jam,
and your votes
are goanna help us decide.
Just call or text in
after each performance--
Kids, make sure to have
your parents' permission.
--and let us know who you think
sang out
and who you think
hit a wrong note.
What's your favourite camp,
Camp Star or Camp Rock?
And we're out.
Okay.
Georgina.
It's great to see you.
As always, Axel.
{laughs}
Well, I'm goanna go backstage
and do some stand-ups
before the concert.
Good luck.
Thank you.
All right, let's go get
some interviews backstage
with some of the campers.
You, uh-- You know her?
No, I know everyone.
But don't worry,
she doesn't have anything
to do with the voting.
Oh.
So I probably
shouldn't hold out hope
for us ever being friends again?
Probably not.
Though you never know.
Next year I might hire you
to run my summer camp.
{chuckles}
Thanks.
But I'm already booked.
Good luck.
{scoffs}
I'll be lucky if you don't
forget your words this time.
By "good luck" I mean
"I hope you fall off the stage."
{scoffs}
{all cheering and applauding}
As the sun goes down,
the volume goes up.
Welcome back to the ultimate
summer-camp showdown,
where you decide the winner.
Now, first up is Camp Star.
Now, Camp Star
was founded only this year
by superstar producer
and founder of Star Records,
Axel Turner...
{audience cheering}
...who's been producing
for over 20 years.
Now, I know if I was goanna
study music,
this is the place
I'd wanna be.
Why is she saying that?
It's her job. She's supposed
to say nice things.
If she doesn't stop talking,
I think I'm goanna throw up.
Too late.
Well, there's no
turning back now,
because the party
has already started.
Camp Star, everybody.
{all cheering and applauding}
{upbeat hip-hop music playing}

{all cheering and applauding}
GEORGINA:
Camp Star, everyone.
Oh! Remember, if you loved them
as much as I did,
call or text in now.
But don't go anywhere,
because in a moment
we're goanna hear from Camp Rock.
What happened to you?
When I get nervous
I sparkle things.
{laughs}
TESS: Would you stop and listen?
LUKE:
You sounded good too.
Hey, you guys
were incredible.
I know, right?
Only one thing would've
made it better: doing it solo.
I totally agree.
It's this bantery thing
that we--
Thanks.
Good luck.
Quite a performance, eh?
No denying it.
But don't count
those votes just yet, love.
I think you're goanna
be very impressed.
I don't need
to be impressed.
It'd be a miracle
if Axel didn't win.
Excuse me?
Do you know how much money
he spent marketing this?
He's paying to text and tweet
every cell phone user
in the western hemisphere.
You don't even
need to see the show
to know to vote
for Camp Star.
MAN:
One minute.
How come I just got a text
telling me to vote
for Camp Star?
I just got one too.
Um, it's asking me
if I wanna download
Camp Star's song
as my ringtone.
You were really a star.
Thanks.
And I really gotta go.
Oh, I hate crust on my bread,
and birds make me nervous.
Excuse me. Oh, uh, that
performance was amazing.
Thank you.
Don't you have somewhere
to be?
Yes, but, you know,
once you start expressing your
innermost thoughts and feelings,
it's kind of hard to stop.
Wish us luck.
Good luck.
Dana, he is the enemy.
No, he's not.
Not everything in life
is a competition.
But I think I just won.
{all cheering and applauding}
And we're back.
If you liked Camp Star,
get ready to be blown away
by Camp Rock.
Now, Camp Rock was founded
by rock icon
and legendary lead guitarist
Brown Cesario.
{all cheering}
You ready?
Let's do this.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Camp Rock.

GEORGINA:
Weren't they incredible?
So call in now, and tell us
which summer camp rules.
And don't go anywhere.
We'll be right back.
Call in, call in.
Yes!
MAN:
Wow!
{keypads beeping}
{dramatic theme playing}
Impressive,
but it'll never sell.
You know, uh, it should still
be about the music.
Maybe so,
but that's why you'll never
make it in this business.
That's fine.
I don't wanna be
in your business.
{chuckles}
{all cheering and applauding}
And the results are in.
{suspenseful theme playing}
{inaudible dialogue}
{melancholy theme playing}
{strumming}
You know, I was thinking about
keeping this as a souvenir.
Can't believe we lost.
Every song
can't be a hit.
Isn't that
what you told me?
It doesn't mean
we have to stop singing.
I'm really sorry I didn't spend
more time with you this summer.
Hey, the whole reason
I came here--
Was to get
to know me better.
And I've learned everything
I need to know.

Hi, we saw the fire.
