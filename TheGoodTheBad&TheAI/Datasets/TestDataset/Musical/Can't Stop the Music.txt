SOMEBODY'S HIP

A GOOD THING HE DID.
THIS ONE JUST GOT FIRED.
QUIT.
FIRED, QUIT.  IT STILL
MEANS THE SAME THING.
NO INCOME.
SAM !  THAT'S
VERY MATERIALISTIC.

I CAN'T HELP IT.
I DIDN'T INVENT IT.
I'M JUST IN IT.
I DIDN'T INVENT IT.
I'M JUST IN IT.
I DIDN'T INVENT IT.

AND I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.
I CARE WHAT HAPPENS
TO YOUR LIFE.
MM-HMM.  LOOK,

DON'T THINK OF ME
AS YOUR LITTLE BROTHER.
COME ON.
I'M TRYING TO BE SERIOUS.

JACK--
STOP AND LISTEN.

LOOK, TONIGHT
BENNY MURRAY IS GONNA SEE
THAT I AM MERELY FABULOUS.
HE'S GONNA MAKE ME

SAM, DON'T YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME ?
IT'S EVERYTHING.
I GET TO PLAY MY MUSIC,
THE PEOPLE ARE GONNA
START COLLAPSING,
AND THE BIG RECORD COMPANIES
ARE GONNA COME CRAWLING !
LOOK, I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU
EVER SINCE I'VE KNOWN YOU
THAT I'M FANTASTIC,
THAT MY MUSIC IS GOOD,
AND TONIGHT I'M GONNA
PROVE IT.
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T
LIKE WHAT I DO,
IF YOU DON'T
LIKE EVERYTHING,
I'LL GO BACK
TO DENTAL SCHOOL
LIKE MY FATHER WANTS.
BUT YOU GOTTA
GIVE ME A CHANCE.
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING FOR.
YOU WANT THIS A LOT,
DON'T YOU ?
YEAH.

YOU ARE LOOKING
AT A KING IN HIS CASTLE.
SEE, THESE SWITCHES
CAN LIFT, DROP...
AND CHANGE THE DISPOSITION
OF EVERYBODY IN HERE.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
WHEN THE MUSIC WENT MAD,
IT WOULD BE YOU AT THE CONTROLS.
SAM.  LOOK AT 'EM.
THEY'RE HAPPY
THEY'RE SO HAPPY.
THEY'VE FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING
THAT GETS 'EM DOWN.
THAT'S WHAT
IT'S ALL ABOUT, ISN'T IT ?
MUSIC IS MAGIC.
I WANNA MAKE THAT MAGIC.

SLOBBER ON THE STAR.

TAKE OVER THE NEXT SET
FOR ME, HUH ?

HEY, YOUR STUFF
IS TERRIFIC.
THANK YOU, SON.
JACK !  JACK !
JACK,
YOU WERE WONDERFUL.
DO YOU REALLY MEAN IT ?
YES !  ABSOLUTELY.
YOU SHOULD BE RECORDED.
NOW, HOW MANY SONGS
DO YOU HAVE ?
I MEAN TO SHOW.
OH, A LOT.  THEY'RE
IN VARIOUS STAGES
OF COMPLETION,
BUT IT WOULDN'T TAKE LONG.
HOW LONG ?
I-I DON'T KNOW.
MAKE ME A REALLY
GOOD DEMO TAPE AND WE'LL
TAKE IT TO A RECORD COMPANY.
SAM, THERE'S MORE
TO IT THAN THAT.
LIKE WHAT ?
LIKE--
LIKE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
LOOK, NOBODY HAS TIME
FOR ANYBODY, AND NOBODY
GIVES NEW PEOPLE A BREAK.
THIS MAY COME
AS A SURPRISE TO YOU,
BUT WHILE YOU WERE
FLUNKING OUT OF COLLEGE,
I WAS DATING AND ROMANCING
SOME OF THE REAL BIGGIES
OF THE RECORD INDUSTRY.
MAMA HAS CONNECTIONS.
ALL RIGHT !
SAM, WILL YOU
GET THAT, PLEASE ?
HELLO.
SAM, UH, I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU,
BUT I AM MAKING THIS CALL
UNDER EXTREME DURESS.
I LAUGH, I CRY,
I GO ON WELFARE.
I AM AN UNMARRIED,
UNEMPLOYED WOMAN.
LULU, WHAT'S THE MATTER ?
SYDNE THREATENED
TO GIVE ME THE SACK
UNLESS I MADE THIS CALL.
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT ?
ME WHO HAS GIVEN THAT SACK
THE BEST YEARS OF MY LIFE ?
LULU, SHUT UP
AND GIVE ME THAT PHONE !
AAH !  AAH !  STOP ME !
- HOW FAT ARE YOU ?
- ENORMOUS.  I'VE BLOWN UP
LIKE THEHINDENBURG.
THIS IS SYDNE CHANNING,
WHO ONLY HELPED MAKE YOU
THE BIGGEST MODEL OF THE '70s.
COME CLEAN.
SYDNE, DARLING,
THE '70s ARE DEAD AND GONE.
THE '80s ARE GOING TO BE
SOMETHING WONDERFULLY NEW
AND DIFFERENT, AND SO AM I.
FREE, HAPPY AND CONTENT.
CONTENTED.  BUT THAT'S
PERFECT FOR THE AD CAMPAIGN FOR
THE AMERICAN DAIRY ASSOCIATION.
COWS ?
MILK, DEAREST.
IT COMES FROM COWS.
SYDNE, DON'T GET UPSET.
I'VE TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU.
I HAVE RETIRED,
ONCE AND FOR ALL.
THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE BIGGEST CAMPAIGN
FOR THE ENTIRE FALL.
MUCHO LUCRATIVO.
MONEY, HONEY.
SYDNE, IT WAS REALLY SWEET
OF YOU TO ASK ME,
BUT HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE
TO TELL YOU NO, NO, NO ?
YOU ARE PASSING UP
THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME !
- MAY I PLEASE SPEAK TO LULU ?
- THERE'S REALLY NO ACCOUNTING
FOR TASTE.
HERE.  SHE WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.
YEAH ?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
WHY DON'T I CALL YOU,
OKAY ?  BYE.
WHAT DID SHE SAY ?
TELL ME EVERYTHING.
UH, SHE JUST INVITED ME OVER
TO SEE HER NEW APARTMENT.
- BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN MAKE IT.
- OH, YES, YOU CAN.
SHE'S DONE
A VERY CLEVER THING.
SHE'S RETIRED.
SHE'S THE GARBO OF MODELS,
AND EVERYONE IS CLAMORING
FOR HER,
AND I'M GOING TO DELIVER HER
IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO.
TO THE DAIRY ASSOCIATION ?
WE ARE GOING
TO MAKE MILK MORE
GLAMOROUS THAN CHAMPAGNE.
MAKE A NOTE.  ONE:
I'M GOING TO SUGGEST
THEY REDESIGN THE BOTTLE.
TWO:  I'M GOING
TO INSIST THEY CORK IT.
THREE:
MISS SAMANTHA SIMPSON
IS GOING BACK TO WORK.
LOVE WITH FREEDOM
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE
SAM, YOU GOTTA HEAR THIS !
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
SWEET.
SWEET ?
YEAH.
SWEET ?
JOHANN STRAUSS WRITES SWEET.
SWEET IS FOR WALTZES.
I CAN'T HEAR THE MUSIC
FOR YOUR VOICE.
WHAT ABOUT THE LYRICS ?
JACK, DARLING,
THE SONG MAY BE WONDERFUL,
BUT YOUR VOICE SOUNDS
LIKE A CRY FOR HELP.
OH.  OH, HO, HO, HO.
WELL, I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE
A MILLION PEOPLE SITTING OUT
THERE SINGING IN THE COURTYARD.
MY MUSICAL EMPIRE
IS NOT FINISHED YET.
WELL, SHOULDN'T A DEMO
SOUND LIKE A REAL RECORD ?
YES, BUT DO YOU KNOW HOW
MUCH THAT'S GOING TO COST ?
WHY IS IT THAT YOU'RE
THE MOST EXPENSIVE PERSON
I'VE EVER BEEN INVOLVED WITH ?
AND WE'RE NOT EVEN LOVERS.
DO YOU KNOW ANY SINGERS ?
YEAH.  WHAT ABOUT
THE SUPREMES ?
THEY'RE NOT WORKING.
SAM, TODAY NOBODY SINGS.
EVERYBODY DANCES.
THIS CALLS
FOR SOME VERY SERIOUS
PLOTTING AND SCHEMING.
YOU GO BACK TO WORK.
I NEED SOME ENERGY.
I'M GOING
FOR A BASKIN-ROBBINS RUSH.
AH, HAVE A GOOD TIME.
GET A DOUBLE-DIP ON ME.
THANKS A LOT.
HEY, FELIPE.
HOW ARE YOU DOING ?
C, C-MINUS.
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?
I HAD TO LEAVE
MY FEATHERS TO BE OILED,
AND THEY GAVE ME
THIS ONE TO WEAR,
AND IT DOESN'T EVEN FIT RIGHT.
YOU THINK
YOU'VE GOT PROBLEMS ?
JACK NEEDS SOME VOICES
ON A TAPE TONIGHT,
AND I NEED SOME PROFESSIONAL
SINGERS WHO WILL WORK
FOR WHAT I CAN AFFORD TO PAY.
PROFESSIONAL
AND FOR FREE ?
THAT YOU AIN'T GONNA FIND.
AH, MY GREATEST FEAR.
WELL, LISTEN.
TELL ME SOMETHING.
DO YOU SING ?
DO I SING ?  DO I SING ?
WHEN I'M CALLING YOU
ZAP !  YOU'RE A STAR,
AT LEAST FOR TONIGHT.
MY HOUSE, 8:00.
GOTCHA !
GOD !  I SHOULD'VE
KNOWN YOU COULD SING,
BUT I GUESS WHEN YOU SEE
SOMEBODY EVERY DAY, YOU JUST
SORT OF TAKE 'EM FOR GRANTED.
I MEAN, COUNTING OUT EXERCISES
IS SORT OF LIKE SINGING,
ISN'T IT ?
YEAH, I THINK
IT IS, YOU KNOW.
IT'S SORT OF LIKE--
GOT THE BACKBONE
CONNECTED TO THE HIPBONE
AND THE HIPBONE CONNECTED
TO THE THIGH BONE
AND THE THIGH BONE
CONNECTED TO THE LEG BONE
HEY, HOW'S THAT ?
IS THAT A STAR
OR IS THAT A STAR ?
PING !  TONIGHT, IT IS.
BE AT MY HOUSE AT 8:00.
I'LL FURNISH THE FOOD.
YOU FURNISH THE VOICE...
AND THE WINE.
YOU ALWAYS WERE
A GREAT HOSTESS, SAM.
DON'T BE FRESH.
DO YOU HAVE A HANDKERCHIEF ?
YEAH.  HERE YOU GO.
THANKS.
THANKS.
SURE.
NOW, WE'RE RECORDING
A SONG MY ROOMMATE WROTE.
IT'S TONIGHT IN OUR BACKYARD,
A SORT OF PARTY, DEMO-SESSION.
WAIT.  DON'T THANK ME.
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.
I'M JUST GLAD I CAN
INCLUDE YOU.
WELL, YOU CAN
INCLUDE ME OUT.
THAT IS THE WORST IDEA
I EVER HEARD.
WHAT, A BUNCH OF YO-YO'S
PUTTIN' ON A HOMEMADE GROUP
IN YOUR BACKYARD ?
THAT WENT OUT WITH JUDY GARLAND
AND MICKEY ROONEY
ONTHE LATE SHOW.
JUDY GARLAND
AND MICKEY ROONEY.
NEVER MISS
THOSE MGM MUSICALS
ONTHE LATE SHOW,
MAINLY
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
THEY RUN MY COMMERCIALS.
IS THAT YOUR
REAL SINGING VOICE
ON THOSE COMMERCIALS ?
YEAH, BUT I'M SURPRISED YOU

SO MUCH PRODUCT-PITCHING.

YEAH, I'M READY.

LIKE A TERRARIUM.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, LULU ?
I HAVE REACHED A POINT
IN MY LIFE...
WHERE I FIND PEOPLE
AND ANIMALS TOO DEMANDING.
ABOUT THE ONLY RELATIONSHIP
I COULD SUSTAIN
IS WITH A PLANT.
MM.  HOW BIZARRE.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE ?
I'VE ALSO DISCOVERED THE JOYS
OF COOKING AND CLEANING.
HOUSEWORK IS LIKE BAD SEX.
EVERY TIME I DO IT,
I SWEAR I WILL
NEVER DO IT AGAIN, UNTIL
THE NEXT TIME COMPANY COMES.
TACKY.
OH, AND HOW IS
THE PLATINUM PRINCE CHARMING
OF THE RECORD WORLD ?
WOULD YOU BELIEVE
I HAD TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT

I DON'T UNDERSTAND...
WHY A GOOD-LOOKING GIRL
LIKE YOU IS DOWN HERE
IN THE VILLAGE...
WITH A BUNCH OF--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT !
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING ?
I DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE.
I ACCEPT THEM.
THERE ISN'T A PERSON
WHO BREATHES WHO DOESN'T
HAVE CERTAIN PECULIARITIES.
AS LONG AS IT

IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME.
YEAH, BUT WHERE

SAM, AM I CRAZY,
OR DOES IT

YOU CAN DO THAT ?

OH, SAM !
MAGIC NIGHT
MAGIC'S IS THE MUSIC
IT'S A MAGIC NIGHT

ALL THE MAGICAL VIBES

OH.  HI, SAM.
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT
ON THE HOTTEST DAY OF THE YEAR
THE AIR-CONDITIONING GOES OUT.
WELL, HOW'D IT GO TODAY ?
- IT DIDN'T.
- DIDN'T WHAT ?
- IT DIDN'T GO.
I SAW A MUSIC PUBLISHER,
A COUPLE OF TALENT AGENTS
AND A RECORD COMPANY V.P.
- WHAT'D THEY SAY ?
- "WOULD I DISCUSS IT
OVER DINNER ?"
- IT'S THE SAME OLD
CASTING COUCH ROUTINE.
- SAM, THIS IS VERY DEPRESSING.
CRITICAL.  I ATE
TWO SNOWBALLS, ONE DING DONG
AND A COUPLE OF TWINKIES.
MAKE YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER ?
IF YOU LIKE FEELING
LIKE THE PILLSBURY DOUGHBOY.
WHO'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
RECORD PERSON WE BOTH KNOW ?
STEVE WAITS.  OH, NO.
I'M NOT SWALLOWING MY PRIDE
AND GOING BACK TO HIM.
SURE YOU CAN.
UH-UH.
ANYBODY WHO CAN SWALLOW
TWO SNOWBALLS
AND A DING DONG...
SHOULDN'T HAVE
ANY TROUBLE WITH PRIDE.
YOU'RE DOING HIM
A FAVOR, SAM.
I'M A VERY TALENTED
COMPOSER, RIGHT ?
RIGHT.
AND MARRAKECH RECORDS
IS THE BIGGEST
AND THE BEST.
SO WHY DON'T WE START
AT THE TOP ?  IT'S BETTER
THAN WORKING OUR WAY UP.
WHAT DO YOU SAY ?
THAT'S MY KIND OF LOGIC.
HELP ME GET READY.
GREAT.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT SHOULD I GIVE HIM ?
INNOCENT LITTLE GIRL
OR WOMAN OF THE WORLD ?
WELL, IF YOU ASKED ME,
I'D TAKE--
I KNOW WHAT YOU'D CHOOSE.
WHICH REMINDS ME.
HOW COME I HAVEN'T HEARD
THE PITTER-PATTER OF LITTLE
STEWARDESSES' PUMPS LATELY ?
HAVE YOU BEEN DECLARED
OFF-LIMITS ?
NO.  THEY HAVE.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
- I'VE GIVEN UP
MY LOVE LIFE COMPLETELY...
UNTIL AFTER I'VE GOTTEN
SOMETHING RECORDED.
- I MADE A SOLEMN VOW.
- JACK, THAT COULD TAKE--
SHH !  DON'T SAY IT.
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
JUST PICK OUT YOUR DRESS
AND GO SELL YOUR ASS OFF.
WELL, THIS DEFINITELY CALLS
FOR TITS AND TEARS.
WELL, SURE I GOT TIME
FOR YOU.  GO AHEAD.
WHAT ?  NO, WE ARE
SHIPPING TRIPLE PLATINUM.
ABSOLUTELY NO RETURNS.
ANYBODY ELSE CALL ?
ROD STEWART.
GET ME HIS PRIVATE NUMBER.
CAN'T GET IT
FROM CELEBRITY SERVICE.
WOULD YOU FIND ME ROD STEWART ?
WHEN YOU DO, HAVE HIM CALL ME
BACK IMMEDIATELY.  YES !
UH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
UH-HUH.  UH-HUH.
SAMANTHA.  OUT.  UH-HUH.
UH-HUH.
OH !
OOH.  UH-HUH.
UH-HUH.
UH--  MM-HMM.
UH-HUH.
UH-HUH.
OH, YEAH.
UH-HUH.
MM-HMM.
DON'T I GET A KISS ?
FIFTY-THOUSAND DOLLARS ?
ARE YOU CRAZY ?
WHO DO YOU THINK I AM,
NEIL BOGART ?  KEEP IN TOUCH.
CAN I GET YOU A DRINK ?
WHAT ?  NO.  WAIT, WAIT.
WOULD YOU JUST WAIT ?
NOW, HOW DID WE RELEASE
THE NEW SINGLE IN ATLANTA ?
YEAH.  UH, TELL HIM
I'LL CALL HIM BACK.
NOW, UH, WHERE WERE WE ?
WELL, STEVE,
IF I COULD JUST--
ONE SECOND.  YEAH ?
NO.  TELL HIM I'LL SEE HIM
A LITTLE AFTER 7:00.
WAIT A MINUTE.
SAMANTHA,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ?
SAMANTHA, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.
IT'S ALL COMING BACK TO ME.
LIVING WITH
THE TOUCH-TONE KID.
I CAN'T GET A WORD IN EDGEWISE.
YOU MEAN THE TELEPHONE ?
YEAH.
NO, THIS IS ME IN THE PAST.
THIS IS NOT ME NOW.  NO.
NO, YOU'VE CHANGED.
YEAH.  I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
YOU DON'T HAVE
A PHONE IN YOUR LIMO ?
NEXT TO THE JOHN ?
NEXT TO THE BED ?
IN THE SAUNA ?
NO.
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
OKAY, WAIT.
JUST ONE MINUTE.
ONE MINUTE.
WANNA SEE WHAT I THINK
OF TELEPHONES NOW ?
THAT'S WHAT I THINK
OF TELEPHONES NOW !
HELLO.  LOOK, WILL YOU
JUST HOLD ALL CALLS ?
I GOTTA GET OUT
OF THIS BUSINESS.
HAVE A SEAT, SWEETHEART.
YEAH.
WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
IS THAT I'M DIFFERENT NOW.
AND--  WELL, THE FACT IS THAT,
UH, THE REASONS YOU LEFT ME
SIMPLY DON'T EXIST ANYMORE.
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO ANSWER THAT.
PROVE IT.
OH, GOD.  I'VE REALLY
MISSED YOU, YOU KNOW THAT ?
I'VE-- I'VE NEVER
STOPPED LOVING YOU,
EVER, EVER, EVER.
THAT BODY OF YOURS
IS SO BEAUTIFUL.
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU.
I'VE GOT TO HAVE YOU AGAIN.
I LOVE YOU.
- WAS THAT ROD STEWART ?
- STEVE, THIS IS NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.
OH, SAM.  DO YOU THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING LEFT
BETWEEN US ?
WELL, YEAH.
WHY DON'T WE, UM, MAKE
SOME BEAUTIFUL MUSIC TOGETHER ?
A CASSETTE ?
OH, NO.  NOT YOU TOO.
OH, JEEZ.
EVERYBODY IS PUSHING
THEIR MUSIC THESE DAYS !
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.
YOU GOT A NEW BOYFRIEND WHO'S
LEARNING HOW TO PLAY THE GUITAR.
WRONG.
I HAVE A NEW LIFE,
NOT A NEW BOYFRIEND.
IT'S JACK'S MUSIC.
YOU REMEMBER JACK ?
YEAH.  THAT KID THAT TOOK CARE
OF YOUR APARTMENT LAST SUMMER
AND LET ALL THE PLANTS DIE ?
WELL, HE'S VERY TALENTED,
AND HE COMPOSED ALL OF THAT.
LISTEN TO ME, SAMANTHA.
MUSIC MAY BE THE OIL
OF SHOW BUSINESS, BUT YOU
DO NOT WANT TO GET INVOLVED.
- TRUST ME.
- TRUST ME.
YOU'VE GOT THE BIGGEST
GROUPS AROUND.
THEY'D GIVE THEIR EYETEETH
TO GET THEIR HANDS
ON THIS MUSIC.
YOUR TAX LAWYERS
ARE WAITING, MR. WAITS.
TAX LAWYERS.  EVERYBODY'S
GOT THEIR HANDS OUT.
EX-PARTNERS,
STOCKHOLDERS, THE I.R.S.
TAKING EVERYTHING I GOT.
I DO ALL THE WORK,
AND THEY TAKE ALL THE MONEY.
GREED !  GREED !
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT GREED.
MY GROUPS WRITE
AND RECORD THEIR OWN MUSIC...
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANNA SHARE
THEIR ROYALTIES WITH ANYBODY.
THEY DON'T EVEN WANNA HEAR
ANYBODY ELSE'S STUFF.
SO HOW DOES A COMPOSER
GET STARTED ?
I DON'T KNOW.  I DON'T KNOW.
TELL HIM HE'S GOTTA
HAVE A HOOK.
TELL JACK
TO GET HIMSELF A GROUP.
A GROUP ?
BUT WE ARE A GROUP.
THEY'RE RIGHT THERE
ON THE TAPE
AND THEY'RE FABULOUS.
OH, YEAH ?
WHAT ARE THEY CALLED ?
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU.
WHERE ARE
THEY PERFORMING ?
THEY'RE NOT.
SAM--
LOOK, I'VE GOT THEM
UNDER WRAPS.
THEY'RE A REVOLUTIONARY
NEW CONCEPT, AND I'M NOT
HAVING MY GROUP RIPPED OFF.
I THOUGHT
IT WAS JACK'S GROUP.
I'M THE MANAGER.
YOU'RE A MANAGER ?
YES, AND I'M NOT LEAVING
THIS OFFICE UNTIL I GET
A COMMITMENT FROM YOU...
FOR A DEMO SESSION.
THAT'S VERY EASY.
YOU GOT IT.
OH.  OH !  REALLY ?
YEAH, YES.
YES.  YES.  YES.
THANK YOU.
I REALLY OWE YOU ONE
FOR THIS.
IF YOU REALLY MEAN THAT,
THEN HOW ABOUT
THE EAST HAMPTON LIKE
THE OLD TIMES THIS WEEKEND ?
OH, THAT'S REALLY
HARD FOR ME...
BECAUSE, UH, I HAVE
TO CONTROL MYSELF
BECAUSE OF MY VOW.
WHAT VOW ?
OH, WELL, I COMMITTED
MYSELF TO CHASTITY...
UNTIL THE GROUP
BECOMES A SUCCESS.
OH, CHASTITY.
YEAH, AND IT'S
REALLY HARD FOR ME.
YEAH.
BECAUSE I WANT
WHAT YOU WANT.
WHAT WE WANT.
WHAT THE WHOLE WORLD WANTS.
BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE ONE THAT I WANT.
NOBODY DOES IT BETTER.
SO KNOCK ON WOOD.
SOMEDAY I'LL FIND YOU
AND WE'LL BE TOGETHER
AGAIN FOR SOME...
HOT STUFF BECAUSE
I LOVE THE NIGHTLIFE...
AND, OOH, I WANNA
MAKE IT WITH YOU.
SO I'LL BE SEEING YOU
BECAUSE YOU LIGHT UP
MY LIFE.
OOH.
SHOO-BE-DO-BE-DO.
HI.  UH--
UH, WHICH WAY'S
THE MEN'S ROOM ?
RIGHT OVER THERE.
THAT WAY.
RICHARD.
COME ON IN.
HI.
HELLO.
UM, HOLD IT !
HEY, WATCH IT.
YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY
I'M A NICE PERSON.
I COULD HAVE RAFFLED
THIS OFF IN THE ELEVATOR.
THANK YOU.
HEY, I MEAN IT.
I REALLY WANNA APOLOGIZE
FOR THE OTHER NIGHT.
I'M A GEMINI.
I GOT TWO PERSONALITIES.
THIS IS THE GOOD ONE.
COME ON.
LET'S BE FRIENDS.
THE ONLY MAN WHO EVER
SAID THAT TO ME
AND MEANT IT WAS JACK.
WELL, FRIENDLY.
CAN I TAKE YOU TO DINNER ?
DON'T YOU HAVE
TO GET BACK TO WORK ?
I'LL COOK UP SOME STORY
AND IT TO 'EM TOMORROW.
HMM.
THE DEVIOUS TYPE, HUH ?
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I'M VERY COOL, CALM
AND CONSCIENTIOUS.
IN FACT, EVERYTHING I DO
IS ON TIME, NEAT AND CORRECT.
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
I GOT AWAY WITH
A LITTLE SOMETHING.
THIS IS REALLY TERRIFIC,
BUT I HAVE TO GET HOME.
COME ON !
I'VE LOST HALF A DAY'S PAY.
RON, YOU'RE REALLY NICE,
BUT I HAVE A GROUP
TO PUT TOGETHER.
NEED ANY HELP ?
ALL I CAN GET.
ALL RIGHT !
HEY, BUDDY !
DAMN.
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
-
-
HEY !  WHOO !
IT TAKES MORE THAN A PRETTY FACE
TO GET ANYWHERE IN THIS TOWN.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
JEEZ !
MA'AM ?
JACK !  JACK !
JACK !  JACK !
WE'RE A GROUP !
WE'VE GOT STUDIO TIME !
WHAT ?
YOU REMEMBER RON.
HE'S REALLY VERY NICE.
HEY, I CAN'T GET THAT SONG
OUT OF MY HEAD.
REMEMBER THAT--
MAGIC NIGHT
RIGHT.
HEY, BUT-- BUT--
HOW'S THE INDIAN ?
FINE.
WOULD YOU GET
THE MUSTARD AND THE RELISH ?
I HAVE TO TAKE MY LENSES OUT.
THEY'RE KILLING ME.
WAIT, SAM !  YOU GOTTA TELL ME
LOGICALLY AND SIMPLY...
WHAT WENT ON
OVER THERE !
WE ARE A GROUP !
WE'RE A GROUP !
YEAH, BUT...
YOU JUST DON'T
PUT TOGETHER A GROUP
LIKE IT WAS A LAUNDRY LOAD.
"LAUNDRY LOAD."
HEY, THAT'S NOT A BAD NAME.
WHERE IS THAT DISTILLED WATER ?
I'VE GOTTA TAKE MY LENSES--
I'LL USE PERRIER.
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT ?
I HAVEN'T QUITE
GOT THE WHOLE THING,
BUT IT SOUNDS PROMISING.
WAIT A MINUTE.
SAM, STOP WITH
ALL THIS BUSY WORK.
THIS IS ALL--
THIS IS MY LIFE HERE !
WAIT A MINUTE.  TELL ME,
HOW DO YOU PUT TOGETHER
A GROUP THAT DOESN'T EXIST ?
I GOT IT.
I JUST DID IT.
I USED MY BRAINS, NOT MY BODY.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
AN ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT IS ?
DO YOU KNOW HOW GOOD
THAT MAKES ME FEEL ?
YEAH.
BUT IT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN
WHAT'S GOING ON !
WE, MY DARLING, ARE A GROUP.
YEAH.
WE'RE A GROUP.
OH !  OH, NO !
OW !
OH, MY GOD !  OH, NO !
OH !  OH, MY GOD !
THANKS A LOT !
OH, MY FLOOR !
ALL OVER THE MUSIC !
GET HIS PANTS OFF.
HELP ME GET HIS PANTS OFF.
I'M BURNING !
IT'S ALL OVER
MY PARQUET FLOOR.
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
WE NEED MORE GUYS.
WHY ?
MY MUSIC NEEDS
A VERY BIG SOUND,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?
OH, I GOT IT !
WE'LL PUT ADS INVARIETY,
BACKSTAGEANDBILLBOARD.
WE'LL HOLD AUDITIONS.
OH, BUT WHERE ?
WE CAN'T DO IT HERE...
BECAUSE WE MADE
SO MUCH NOISE
THE OTHER NIGHT...
THAT TWO NEIGHBORS
COMPLAINED AND--
I CAN'T AFFORD
TO RENT A HALL.
WELL, YOU CAN USE MY OFFICE.
YOUR OFFICE
A WEEK FROM FRIDAY ?
YEAH, SURE.

SAM, YOU WRITE UP THE AD.
THIS IS TERRIFIC !
I GOTTA THINK !

WHO'D HAVE THUNK IT,
RIGHT ?  HEY.
ECH !  I'LL THINK
ABOUT THAT TOMORROW.
BLECH !

YOU GO WRITE THE AD.
SAM, I LEFT A NEW SONG
ON MY RECORDER.
GIVE IT A LISTEN IF YOU'VE
GOT NOTHING BETTER TO DO.
I THINK I CAN DO
TWO THINGS AT ONCE.
THE PAD AND THE PENCIL
ARE ON THE DESK.
UM, SAM'S VERY DELICATE.
I'D LIKE FOR HER
NOT TO SEE YOUR KNEES.
CRAZY.
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME WINE ?
THAT'D BE NICE.
YOU LOOK QUITE COMFORTABLE.
I-I AM.
THIS CITY WAS
GETTING TO ME FOR A WHILE,
BUT I THINK
I'M GETTING USED TO IT.
I'VE BEEN LIVING HERE
AND WORKING HERE
SINCE I WAS 18,
AND I WOULDN'T LIVE
ANYWHERE ELSE.
YOU KNOW,
I NEVER DATED A GIRL
WITH A MALE ROOMMATE.
WELL, THIS IS THE '80s,
DARLING.
YOU'RE GONNA SEE
A LOT OF THINGS YOU'VE
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
OH, EXCUSE ME !
OH, I'M SORRY !
HERE.  LET ME HELP

YEAH !
WELL, GET--
LET ME SEE IF I--
OH, MY GOD.

UH, KIND OF.
NOW LISTEN,
I DRAW THE LINE AT YOUNGER MEN,
BUT I DEFINITELY DRAW THE LINE
AT YOUNGER MARRIED MEN.
IT'S COMIN' THROUGH.
MY DIVORCE.
WHAT ?
THAT IS A TIRED LINE.
NO, IT'S NOT.
THAT'S WHY I MOVED
FROM ST. LOUIS,
TO HAVE SOME FUN.
OH, WHOA !
WELL, ARE YOU ?
I AM NOW.
THIS LITTLE PIGGY
WENT TO MARKET...
CUT IT OUT !
AND THIS LITTLE PIGGY
WENT HOME.

THIS FIRM'S REPRESENTED
MANY ENTERTAINMENT CLIENTS
OVER THE YEARS.
YES, TRUE.  COLE PORTER
PLAYED THAT PIANO.
WE REPRESENTED
RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN,
MARVIN HAMLISCH.
BUT THIS SORT OF SHENANIGANS
IS NOTHING SHORT OF
DISGRACEFUL.
I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY.
RON, DEAR, DIDN'T
GREENWICH VILLAGE PEOPLE-TYPES

NEW YORK THAT THERE HAD TO BE
SOMEBODY DID THE SAME THING.
SO I MADE A FEW PHONE CALLS,
SOMEBODY GAVE ME AN ADDRESS...
AND MADE ARRANGEMENTS
FOR US TO USE IT.
HEY, THAT'S TERRIFIC !
YOU'RE TERRIFIC.

I MADE A FORTUNE
IN THIS BUSINESS
USING MY INTUITION,
AND MY INTUITION TELLS ME,
"DO NOT GET INVOLVED."
I'M SORRY.
JUST STAY VERY COOL,
CALM AND COLLECTED.
I AM PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF TAKING CARE OF THIS.
IT WASN'T THAT BAD, WAS IT ?
I CAN'T BELIEVE

THEY WERE GREAT !
AND YOU WERE FABULOUS.
YEAH ?
HOLD ON, GUYS.
DID IT AGAIN.
GOT MYSELF A NEW GROUP,

WHAT IN THE HELL
IS THE MATTER WITH YOU ?

I'M SORRY, SAMANTHA, REALLY.
I KNOW THAT YOU PUT
A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY
INTO THIS GROUP,
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
EXTRA MONEY COMING IN,
BUT THEY'VE GOT A VERY LITTLE
SOMETHING TO OFFER, VERY LITTLE,
TO A VERY SMALL AUDIENCE.
NOW I'LL SHOW YOU EXACTLY
HOW DISINTERESTED I AM.
THAT'S IT.  THAT'S MY OFFER.
NOW, DON'T GET ALL EXCITED
AND THANK ME.
WE MAY NOT BE LOVERS ANYMORE,
BUT WE'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE
GOOD, SOLID FRIENDS.
ARE YOU MAD ?
THAT WOULDN'T FEED MY CAT !
YOU DON'T HAVE A CAT.
TAKE YOUR OFFER
AND STICK IT IN YOUR EAR !
THEY'RE WORTH
A LOT MORE THAN THAT !
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
GIVE ME THIS SHIT ?
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, SISTER.
THAT'S OKAY, KIDDO.

WHAT THAT WILL COST ?
DO YOU KNOW

- MA, IT'S ONLY A COMMERCIAL.
- AW, NOW, HONEY,
DID GERSHWIN EVER WRITE
A HIT COMMERCIAL, HUH ?
WELL,
HOW'D YOU LIKE IT ?
I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE GOING
TO SHOW SO MUCH OF YOURSELF
ON TELEVISION.
OH, SAM, THAT IS THE MOST
GLAMOROUS AND SEXY
COMMERCIAL I HAVE EVER SEEN.
AW, LULU.
LULU, WILL YOU
TAKE THIS AWAY ?
I DO NOT DO MANUAL LABOR.
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING ?
YOU ARE SO UPTIGHT...
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
A GREAT CAREER MOVE
WHEN YOU SEE ONE.
IF THAT DOESN'T SELL MILK,
NOTHING WILL.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, SAMANTHA,
I'M HAVING A BIT OF A PROBLEM
WITH THE ADVERTISING AGENCY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
DESPITE THE FACT
THAT I THINK
IT'S FABULOUS,
THE CLIENT
NEEDS MORE TIME
TO THINK IT OVER.
THINK WHAT OVER ?
THE HIGHER ECHELON
OF MADISON AVENUE...
FEELS THAT IT MAY BE
TOO CONTROVERSIAL...
FOR THE AMERICAN
FAMILY IMAGE.
CORPORATE THINKING SUCKS.
MOTHER !
I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY CHIC
AND TASTEFUL.
TWO QUALITIES OFTEN
IGNORED BY TELEVISION.
WELL, THIS MEANS
NO RESIDUALS FOR A WHILE.
RESIDUALS ?  DOES THAT
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH MONEY ?
HMM.
UH, YEAH,
WE NEED IT NOW.
WELL, YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY
BE OVERDRAWN AT THE BANK.
COULD YOU, DEAR ?
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
WE WERE GOING TO USE
THE RESIDUAL PAYMENTS
FROM THE COMMERCIAL...
TO PUT ON A PAY PARTY
TO INTRODUCE
THE VILLAGE PEOPLE.
PAY TO GO TO A PARTY ?
HOW GAUCHE !
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY.
MY BRIDGE CLUB
WILL THROW THE PARTY.
WE'LL USE THE ELKS LODGE.
WHY, IT'LL BE BIGGER
THAN BINGO NIGHT.
MOM, THAT'S WONDERFUL,
BUT, SEE, WE WERE THINKING
OF SOMETHING SPECTACULAR.
UH-OH.  YOU NEED
THE BIG BUCKS, HUH ?
YEAH.
WELL, MY GOODNESS,
A PARTY IS A PARTY.
IT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.
NORMA, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
SOMETHING FOR AROUND
WITH LIGHTS
AND COSTUMES.
I MEAN,
A REAL SHOW.
WELL, I DID ONE FOR 3,000
LAST MONTH IN--
WHERE WAS IT ?
HOUSTON.
YOU GAVE A PARTY
FOR 3,000 PEOPLE ?
MM-HMM.
A CHARITY FUND-RAISER.
IT'S ONE OF MY HOBBIES.
BUT, OF COURSE, WE DO
RAISE A LOT OF MONEY
FOR THE NEEDY.
MRS. WHITE, WOULD YOU
CONSIDER US NEEDY ?
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I AM IN CHARGE OF
A REALLY GRAND AFFAIR...
NEXT MONTH IN SAN FRANCISCO
AT THE GALLERIA.
NOW, WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE
FOR THE BOYS TO SING
A FEW SONGS ?
A-- A FEW SONGS ?  HEY !
WE WILL KNOCK 'EM OUT !
I THINK I SHOULD GET
STEVE WAITS IN ON THIS.
LET'S HAVE
SOME CHAMPAGNE !
LULU,
PACK MY FALL WARDROBE.
I ADORE SAN FRANCISCO.
MY FAVORITE
EX-HUSBAND LIVES THERE.
AND I AM DOWN
TO MY LAST PUCCI.
HAVE I GOT
A WHOLESALER FOR YOU !
STEVE ?  HELLO, DARLING.
IT'S SAMANTHA.
I, UH, THINK I HAVE
AN OFFER YOU CAN'T REFUSE.
HOW ABOUT A LONG WEEKEND
IN SAN FRANCISCO ?
UH-HUH.  WELL,
I'LL SEE YOU AT YOUR PLACE
IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES.
I'LL GIVE YOU
ALL THE DETAILS.
BYE.
I JUST SEALED OUR FUTURE.
AND ENDED OURS.
GET YOUR MIND OUT OF THE GUTTER.
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
STEP INTO MY OFFICE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU CALLED STEVE WAITS...
AND MADE AN ASSIGNATION
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME !
WHAT'S THAT ?
A DATE !
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO ?
I WOULDN'T DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT BEHIND YOUR BACK.
WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO DO,
SEDUCE HIM INTO A DEAL ?
IS THAT ACTUALLY
WHAT YOU THINK OF ME ?
I DON'T KNOW.  I--
OH, REALLY ?
WELL, UM, IF THAT'S THE CASE,
I SUGGEST WE SEE EACH OTHER
ONLY ON A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP
FROM NOW ON.
AND I'LL SEE YOU
IN SAN FRANCISCO, MR. WHITE.
ALL RIGHT, SO MAKE IT QUICK
BECAUSE SAMANTHA'S
GONNA BE HERE ANY MINUTE.
HOW DID WE DO
IN CHICAGO ?
OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.
UH-HUH.  UH-HUH.
MM-HMM.  UH-HUH.
OKAY, GOOD-BYE.
CHARLIE, THE MINUTE
SHE GETS ON BOARD,
SLAM THE DOOR AND
TAKE OFF, ALL RIGHT ?
NEVER MIND.
IS THAT YOU, SAM ?
HI, MR. WAITS.  I'M SORRY.
SAM COULDN'T MAKE IT.
IT'S A LONG STORY.
OH, MY GOD.
A REAL PRIVATE JET !
SOMEDAY YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE ONE OF THESE, BABY.
A LITTLE BIGGER, I HOPE.
AND I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE DECOR MYSELF.
NOT SO BUSY.
AND WHO'S THIS ?
OH, UH, MR. WAITS,
THIS IS MY MOTHER.
HELEN MORELL.  AND YOU CAN
JUST THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS
THAT YOU KNOW MY SON.
WILD BLUE YONDER !
HERE WE GO !
GEE, THESE LOOK GOOD.
DON'T TOUCH THAT, JACKIE.
IT'LL GIVE YOU THE TROTS.
WHEW !  CAN'T WE GET RID
OF THAT SMELLY THING ?
I GOT ALL
YOUR FAVORITES HERE, BABY.
I GOT CHICKEN SOUP
WITH MATZO BALLS.
I GOT KREPLACH.
I GOT STUFFED CABBAGE.
SHE'S NOT EVEN JEWISH.
WELL, WHEN IT COMES TO EATING,
ALL MOTHERS ARE JEWISH.
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE !
I AM BEING HIJACKED
IN MY OWN AIRPLANE !
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ?
I AM THE PRESIDENT OF
A MAJOR RECORD COMPANY.
IS IT REALLY KREPLACH
IN THERE ?
I GOT EVERYTHING.
YOU SEE, SIR,
MY FATHER IS JEWISH,
BUT MY MOM,
SHE'S ITALIAN-CATHOLIC.
SO, WE GOT
ALL THE BASES COVERED.
SPEAKING OF BASEBALL,
WHILE THE OTHER KIDS WERE
FOLLOWING THE BASEBALL SCORES,
I WAS FOLLOWING THE POP CHARTS.
YOU CAN ASK ME ANY--
I THINK I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.
WHY DON'T YOU SAVE THAT FOR
THE LINER NOTES ON THE ALBUM ?
ALBUM ?  WE'RE GETTING
AN ALBUM DEAL ?
NO !  I DID NOT SAY THAT.
I WORKED FOR DAVID MERRICK
ON BROADWAY.
I KNOW ABOUT CONTRACTS.
I THINK WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO INSIST ON 10%
OF THE FIRST 100% NET PROFITS.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE NOT
SEEN THIS GROUP EVEN PERFORM.
OH, LET ME TELL YOU !
AFTER THIS CONCERT,
PEOPLE WILL BE STANDING
ON THEIR HEADS TO BID.
NOBODY IN THIS WORLD IS GONNA
GIVE YOU ANY MORE THAN 2%
OF 6% OF 100% OF THE PROFITS.
HOW ABOUT NINE PERCENT ?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
NO MORE THAN SEVEN.
EIGHT PERCENT ?
YOU'RE ROBBING ME.
OH, USE YOUR NAPKIN !
I'M SORRY.
WHAT ABOUT THE MERCHANDISING ?
NOT SO FAST !
AH, YES, THE MERCHANDISING.
NOW, I THINK THAT WE WILL
HAVE TO ASK FOR THE T-SHIRTS.
I FEEL LIKE I'M SITTING
ON MY OWN PLANE WITH
MA BARKER AND HER KID !
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANNA FIGHT ?
YOU GET THE T-SHIRTS,
I GET THE LUNCH PAILS
AND THE LOOK-ALIKE DOLLS.
YOU CAN HAVE
THE T-SHIRTS IN JAPAN.
WE WILL TAKE THE LUNCH PAILS
WORLDWIDE.
BACK UP A MINUTE
AND GO ALL THE WAY
BACK TO THE BEGINNING.
NOW, WHICH ONE
IS THE KREPLACH ?
I SEE YOU.
BUBBE,
THE FIRST TIME
I PLAYED SAN FRANCISCO,
I CAME IN ON A BUS.
AND HERE I AM COMING BACK
WITH MY SUCCESSFUL SON
ON A PRIVATE JET.
OH, LOOK, MA,
LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL.
OH, OH, JACKIE, IT IS TRUE.
THERE IS MAGIC IN THE WORLD.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

THIS GAME CALLED LIFE
IT'S A TOUGH GAME TO PLAY
