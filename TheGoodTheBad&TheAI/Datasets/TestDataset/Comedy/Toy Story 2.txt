Buzz Lightyear mission log.
All signs point to this planet
as the location ofZurg's fortress,
but there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.
-
-
-
-
-
-
Come to me, myprey.
To infi nity and beyond!
So, we meet again,
Buzz Lightyear, for the last time.
Not today, Zurg!
-
-
- %%
- Oh, no! No!
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, you almost had him.
- I'm never gonna defeat Zurg!
- Sure, you will, Rex.
- I n fact,
you're a better Buzz than I am.
- But look at my little arms!
I can't press the "fi re" button
and jump at the same time!
Where is it?
Where is it?
- Uh, Woody?
- Huh?
-
-  Ooh.
Hang on, cowboy!
- Woody, are you all right?
-  Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fi ne, Buzz. Okay. Here's your
list ofthings to do while I'm gone.
Batteries need to be changed.
Toys in the bottom ofthe chest
need to be rotated.
Oh, and make sure everyone
attends Mr. Spell's seminar...
on what to do
ifyou or a part ofyou is swallowed.
- Okay? Okay. Good. Okay.
- Woody, you haven't found
your hat yet, have you?
No! And Andy's leaving
for cowboy camp any minute,
and I can't fi nd it anywhere!
Don't worry, Woody.
I n just a few hours,
you'll be sitting around a campfi re with
Andy making delicious, hot "sch'moes."
- They're called s'mores, Buzz.
- Right. Right. Ofcourse.
Has anyone found Woody's hat yet?
Keep looking, men.
Dig deeper! Negatory. Still searching.
The lawn gnome next door says it's not
in the yard, but he'll keep lookin'.
It's not in Molly's room.
We've looked everywhere.
- I found it.
- You found my hat?
Your hat? No.
The missus lost her earring.
- Oh, my little sweet potato!
- Oh, you found it!
Oh, it's so nice...
to have a big, strong spud
around the house.
- Ooh!
- Oh, great. That's just great.
This'll be the fi rst year I miss cowboy
camp, all because of my stupid hat!
- Woody, look underyour boot.
- Don't be silly.
- My hat is not under my boot.
- Would you just look?
You see? No hat.
J ust the word "Andy."
Uh-huh. And the boy who
wrote that would take you to
camp with or without your hat.
I'm sorry, Bo.
It's just that I've been
lookin' forward to this all year.
- It's my one time
with just me and Andy.
- You're cute when you care.
- Bo, not in front of Buzz.
-  Let him look.
-
- Miss Peep, your sheep!
-
-
- This is Al from Al's Toy Barn,
and I'm sittin' on good deals.
- Whoa!
Ow! I think I'm feeling
a deal hatching right now.
Whoa! Let's see what we got. We got
boats for a buck, Beanies for a buck--
-Rex, turn it off!. Someone's gonna hear!
-Which one is off?
Buck-buck-buck! And that's
cheap-cheap-cheap! So hurry on down--
For cryin' out loud, it's this one.
- I despise that chicken.
- Fellas!Fellas!
- Okay, I got some good news,
and I got some bad news.
- What news?
The good news is
I found your hat, Woody.
My hat! Slink, thankyou.
Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou.
- Where'd you fi nd it?
- Well, that's the bad news.
-
- Oh, it's Buster!
Canine alert! Man your
battle stations! Let's move, move, move!
-
- Woody! Hide! Quick!
-
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay! You found me!
Buster, all right.
Hey, how did he do, Hamm?
- Looks like a new record.
- Okay, boy. Sit.
- Reach for the sky.
-
- Gotcha!
-
Greatjob, boy.
Who's gonna miss me
while I'm gone, huh?
- Who's gonna miss me?
Who's gonna miss me?
-
Andy, yougotallyourstuff?.
-Have a good weekend, everybody.
I'll see you Sunday night.
-It's in my room.
-
- Stick 'em up.
I guess we'll work on that later.
Hey, Woody.
Ready to go to cowboy camp?
Andy, honey, come on.
Five minutes, and we're leavin'.
Five minutes. Hmm.
Help, help!
Somebody help me!
Let her go, evil Dr. Pork Chop!
Never!
Youmust choose, SheriffWoody.
Howshall she die?
Shark, ordeath by monkeys?
- Choose!
-
I choose Buzz Lightyear!
- What? That's nota choice!
-
To infinity andbeyond!
- I'll save you, Miss Peep.
- My hero.
-  Thanks, Buzz.
-  No problem, buddy.
You should never tangle
with the unstoppable duo
ofWoody and Buzz Lightyear!
Oh, no.
Andy, let's go!
Molly's already in her car seat.
- But, Mom, Woody's arm wrecked.
- Oh, no.
- Maybe we can fi x him on the way.
- No, just leave him.
I'm sorry, honey,
but you know toys don't last forever.
- What happened?
- Woody's been shelved.
Andy!
- Woody?
- Woody? Honey, are you okay?
Yee-hah!
Ride 'em, cowboy!
He's back? Hey, everybody! Andy's back!
He's back early from cowboy camp!
- Places, everybody! Andy's coming!
-
Yeah!
**
Hey, Woody!
Did you miss me?
Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap.
Ride 'em, cowboy!
Ohh. I forgot.
You're broken.
I don't wanna play with you anymore.
No, Andy!
No. No, Andy! No!
Andy. Andy.
Bye, Woody.
No! No! Andy!
-
-  Wheezy, is thatyou?
- Hey, Woody.
- What are you doing up here?
I thought Mom tookyou
to get your squeaker fi xed months ago.
- Andy was so upset.
- Nah. Shejust told him that
to calm him down...
and then put me on the shelf.
- Why didn't you yell for help?
- Well, I tried squeakin'.
But I'm still broken.
No one could hear me.
Besides, the dust
aggravates my condition.
What's the point in
prolonging the inevitable?
We're all just one stitch away
from here to there.
Yardsale? Yardsale!
Yard sale! Guys, wake up, wake up!
There's a yard sale outside!
- Yard sale?
- Sarge, emergency roll call!
Sir, yes, sir!
Red alert!
All civilians fall in position now!
Single fi le! Let's move, move, move!
- Hamm? Potato Head, Mr. and Mrs.?
- Here.
-  Here.
- Troikas. Check,
check, check, check, check.
- I hate yard sales!
Someone's coming!
Okay. Let's see what's up here.
Bye, Woody.
Wheezy! Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.
Ooh--
-
- Hey. Here, boy. Here, Buster!
Up here!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Okay, boy.
To the yard sale! Hyah!
-
What's goin 'on?He's nuts.
- His arm ain't that bad.
Don't do it, Woody!
We love you!
Careful on the steps, now.
Okay, boy. Let's go.
And keep it casual.
Not that casual.
-  Piggy bank
coming through, coming through.
-  Is he out there?
There he is.
-
- **
- He's in the box!
-  He's sellin' himself
for 25 cents!
- You're worth more than that.
- Holdon. Holdon.
He's gotsomething.
- It's Wheezy!
-  Wheezy?
Hey, it's not suicide.
It's a rescue.
-
-
Good boy, Buster. Hold still.
There. There you go, pal.
- Bless you, Woody.
- All right, now.
Back to Andy's room. Hyah!
-
-  Way togo, cowboy.
-  Golly bob howdy!
- Woody, I'm slipping!
Mommy-- Mommy, look!Look at this!
- Mommy, look! It's a cowboy dolly!
- Hey, that's not her toy!
What's thatlittlegal
thinkshe's doin '?
- Mommy, Mommy, can we get it?
Please? Mommy, please?
- Oh, honey.
You don't want that toy.
It's broken.
-
There's a snake in my boot.
-
Original hand-painted face.
Natural-dye, blanket-stitched vest!
Little rip. Fixable. Oh, ifonlyyou had
your hand-stitched, polyvinyl--
A hat!
I found him! I found him! I found him!
-
- Buster! Quiet do wn!
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- Yes. You can help
take his paws off my pal.
I'll give you, uh,
- Oh, now, how did this get down here?
- Handher thesheriff.
Nice andeasy.
- Five dollars.
- I'm sorry. It's an old family toy.
-  Wait!
- Nowjust walk away. The other way.
- I'll give you 50 bucks for it.
- Fifty bucks ain't bad.
- It's not forsale.
- Everything's for sale.
- We'll trade. You like my watch?
- Sorry.
- He's safe. Way to go!
- She showed him!
- Molly, don't touch that, sweetie.
-
Yeah. Go home, Mr. Fancy Car.
- Holdon.
-  What's up?
Whatis it, Buzz?
-
-  What's happening?
What's he doing?
I can't watch!
Cansomeone covermy eyes?
- He's stealin ' Woody!
-  What?
He can't take Woody. It's illegal.
- Where's he going?
- Do something.
- Buzz!
-
-  Get him, Buzz.
Where's the red jacket?
Why would someone steal Woody?
All right.
Let's review this one more time.
At precisely 8:32-ish,
Exhibit "A," Woody, was kidnapped.
Exhibit " B,"
a composite sketch ofthe kidnapper.
- He didn't have a beard like that.
- Fine. Etch, give him a shave.
The kidnapper was bigger than that.
- Oh, picky, picky, picky.
- Let's just go straight to Exhibit " F."
The kidnapper's vehicle.
Now, the vehicle fled the scene
in this direction.
- Your eyes are in backwards.
It went the other way.
- Hey. Put a cork in it.
- How do you spell " F.B.I." ?
- My crime scene!
Oh, why don't you watch
where you're going, "Godspilla" ?
- I didn't know there was a crime scene.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- A little quiet, please. Thankyou.
- Huh?
Lazy toy brain.
- Lousy try, Brian.
- What are you doing, Buzz?
It's some sort of message
encoded on that vehicle's I.D. tag.
- Liz try bran.
- It's just a license plate.
It's just a jumble of letters.
Yeah, and there are about
in the tri-county area alone.
- Lou's thigh burn.
-
Oh, this can't help.
Let's leave Buzz to play with his toys.
Toy. Toy. Toy.
Hold on!
- Al's Toy Barn.
- Al's Toy Barn!
Etch, draw that man
in a chicken suit.
-
- It's the chicken man!
-  That's ourguy.
- I knew there was something
I didn't like about that chicken.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll be right there.
And we're gonna do this commercial
in one take, do you hear me,
because I am in the middle
ofsomething really important.
-
-
You, my little cowboy friend,
are gonna make me big buck-buck-bucks.
-
-
Andy!
I can't believe I have to drive
all the way to work on a Saturday.
- All the way to work!
-
What? Whoa!
Hey! Stop! Horsey, stop!
Stop! Sit, boy!
Stop it!
Sit, I said!
Whoa! Whoa.
- Yee-hah!
-
It's you! It's you!
It's you! It's you! It's you!
- It's reallyyou!
- What's me?
- Whoo-whee!
-
There's a snake in my boot.
- Ha! It is you!
- Please stop saying that.
Prospector said somedayyou'd come.
Sweet mother ofAbraham Lincoln!
The Prospector!
He'll wanna meet ya!
Say " hello" to the Prospector!
- It-- It's a box.
- He's mint in the box.
Never been opened.
Turn me around,
Bullseye, so I cansee.
Why, the prodigal son has returned.
Yee-hah!
It's you! It's you!
You're here! It's you!
It's you! It's you!
Okay. I'm offi cially freaked-out now.
Oh, we've waited countless years
for this day.
- It's goodtoseeyou, Woody.
- Listen. I don't know wh--
- Hey, how do you know my name?
- Everyone knows your name, Wood-y.
Why, you don't know
who you are, do you? Bullseye?
That's me.
Wow.
Holy cow.

Let me take the wheel.
-
-  It's too fast.
- How can you even tell what's on?
- I can tell.
-
-  Stop! Back, back, back!
Too late. I'm in the 40s.
Got to go 'round the horn. It's faster.
-  Back, back! Stop!
- And look for the giant chicken!
Now, Etch!
That's where I need to go.
You can't go, Buzz.
You'll never make it there.
Woody once risked his life to save me.
I couldn't call myself his friend
if I weren't willing to do the same.
So who's with me?
I'm packing you an extra pair ofshoes
and your angry eyes just in case.
This is for Woody when you fi nd him.
All right, but I don't think
it'll mean the same coming from me.
Mr. Buzz Lightyear,
youjustgottasave mypal Woody.
-
- I'll do my best, son.
Okay, fellas.
Let's roll.
Geronimo!
You'd think with
all my video game experience,
I'd be feeling more prepared.
The idea is to let go.
We'll be back before Andy gets home.
Don't talk to any toyyou don't know!
To Al's Toy Barn and beyond!
They don't
call this the old abandoned mine
for nothin', Prospector.
I reckon we oughta
get outta here.
Where's my gold?
Holdon. I'll lightme a candle.
Where's my gold?
Holdon. I'll lightme a candle.

% Yodel-ay-hee-hoo %
Hey, critters, go get SheriffWoody.
Now scurry!
Good job,
Bullseye. I reckon the new
schoolhouse is fi nally done.
-
- What's that?
Jessie and Prospector are trapped
in the old abandoned mine,
and Prospectorjust lit a stick
ofdynamite thinkin' it was a candle,
and now they're about
to be blown to smithereens?
-  Mm-hmm.
- Ride like the wind, Bullseye!
You're fannin' the flames,Jessie!
It takes brains to put out that fi re.
Yow! My biscuits are burnin'!
Will Woody and Bullseye land to safety?
Can they reachJessie
andStinky Pete in time?
Tune in next week for the exciting
conclusion: "Woody's Finest Hour."
All right! All right! Next tape!
Hey, w-wait.
Whathappened? Whathappens next?
- Come on! Let's see the next episode!
-  That's it.
- What?
- The show was canceled after that.
Wait. What about the gold mine and the
cute little critters and the dynamite?
That was a great show!
I mean, why cancel it?
Two words: Sput-nik.
Once the astronauts went up, children
only wanted to play with space toys.
I know how that feels.
But still, my own show.
- I mean, look at all this stuff!.
- Didn 'tyouknow?
Why, you're valuable property!
I wish the guys could see this.
Hey-howdy-hey. That's me.
I'm on a yo-yo.
Oh, hey. Nice teeth.
And yet, still a good-lookin' guy.
Oh, it's a bank! Cool.
Wh-What do you do?
You push the hat, and out co--
Oh, out come bubbles. Clever.
Oh, wow. Hey, what's this thing do?
I get it.

Look at us!
We're a complete set!
- Now it's on to the museum.
- Museum?
-
-
- What museum?
- The museum.
We're being sold
to the Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo.
- That's inJapan!
-Japan? No, no, no, no, no.
I can't go toJapan.
What do you mean?
I got to get back home to
my owner, Andy. Hey, look, look. See?
-  He still has an owner.
- Oh, my goodness.
No. Can't go.
-I can't do storage again. I just can't!
-J essie.Jessie.
- I won't go back in the dark!
- What's the matter?
What's wrong with her?
- Well, we've been in storage
for a long time waiting foryou.
-
- Why me?
- The museum's only interested
in the collection...
ifyou're in it, Woody.
Withoutyou, wego back intostorage.
- It's that simple.
- It's not fair!
How can you do this to us?
Hey, look. I'm sorry,
but this is all a big mistake.
- You see, I was in this yard sale--
- Yard sale?
Why were you in a yard sale
ifyou have an owner?
Well, I wasn't supposed to be there.
I was trying to save another toy when--
Was it because you're damaged?
Hmm? Did this Andy breakyou?
Yeah, but-- No, no, no, no, no!
It was-- It was an accident.
- Imean--
- Sounds like he really loves you.
It's not like that, okay?
And I'm not going to any museum!
- Well, I'm not going back into storage!
-
-
- Al's coming!
-
- Go! Go on,Jessie.Jessie, look at me.
- Oh, oh, oh.
I promise you'll come out ofthe box.
Now go! Go!

It's show time!
Oh, money, baby.
Money, money, money.
And now,
the main attraction.
%%
No! His arm! Where's his arm?
Oh... no. No, no, no, no!
What am I gonna do?
I know. I know.
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Pick up the phone!
-  Hello?
- It's me. It's Al.
I got an emergency here.
- Well, I'm busy.
- Yes, we're all busy.
Look. It has to be tonight.
-
- All right. All right.
But fi rst thing in the morning.
It's gone!
I can't believe it!
- My arm is completely gone!
- All right. Come here. Let me see that.
-
- Oh, it's just a popped seam,
easily repaired.
- You should consideryourself lucky.
- Lucky?
Are you shrink-wrapped?
I am missing my arm!
Big deal.
Let him go.
I'm sure his precious Andy...
is dying to play with
a one-armed cowboy doll.
Why,Jessie, you know he wouldn't last
an hour on the streets in his condition.
It's a dangerous world
out there for a toy.
All right.
Nobody look till I get my cork back in.
- Good work, men.
Two blocks down and only 1 9 more to go.
- What?
-  Nineteen?
- Are we gonna do this all night?
- My parts are killing me.
- Come on, fellas.
Did Woody give up
when Sid had me strapped to a rocket?
-  No.
- No.
And did he give up when you threw him
out ofthe back ofthat moving van?
- Oh, you had to bring that up.
- No, he didn't!
We have a friend in need, and we will
not rest until he's safe in Andy's room!
- **
- Now let's move out!
And that concludes our broadcast day.

-
Bullseye. Bullseye, go, go, go, go.
Oh, tsk. Come on. You don't wanna
help me. I'm the bad guy.
You're gonna go back in storage
because of me, remember?J ust go.
Bullseye--
All right. All right.
But you have got
to keep quiet. Come on.
Over here. Attaboy.
Okay, Bullseye. Upsy-daisy.
Psst. Bullseye. Cutit out.

Where is the remote?
Why don't Iputitin thesameplace

What is your problem? Look, I'm sorry
I can't help you guys out.
Really, I am. But you didn't have
to go and pull a stunt like that.
What? You think I did that?
Oh, right, right.
The TVjust happened to turn on,
and the remote magically ended up
in front ofyou!
- You calling me a liar?
- Well, ifthe boot fi ts--
Say that again.
Ifthe boot fi ts.
Okay, cowboy.
- Yah!
-
Howdoyoulike that?
Take itback! Take itback!
Don't thinkjust 'cause you're a girl,
I'm gonna take it easy on you.
-
-Jessie, Woody, you stop this at once.
-
-
I don'tknow
how that television turnedon,
but fi ghting about it
isn't helping anything.
- If I had both my arms--
- The fact is, you don't, Woody,
so I suggest
you just wait until morning.
- The cleaner will come, fi x your arm--
- And then I'm outta here!
Oh, no, no.
Bullseye, don't take it that way.
- It's just that Andy--
- Andy, Andy, Andy.
That's all he ever talks about.
Hey, Buzz, can we slow down?
May I remind you that some of us are
carrying over six dollars in change?
Losing health units.
Must rest.
- Is everyone present and accounted for?
- Not quite everyone.
- Who's behind?
- Mine.
Hey, guys.
Why do the toys cross the road?
- Not now, Hamm.
- Oh, I love riddles. Why?
To get to the chicken
on the other side!
-
-  The chicken!
- Oh, well. We tried.
- We'll have to cross.
- What the-- You're not
turning me into a mashed potato.
-
I may not be a smart dog,
but I know what roadkill is.
There must be a safe way.
Okay.
Here's ourchance. Ready. Set. Go.
Drop!
-
-
Go!
Drop! I said "drop"!
-
-  Go!
Drop.
Go.
That went well.
Good job, troops.
We're that much closer to Woody.
-
- Oh, thank goodness you're here.
Is the specimen ready for cleaning?
So, uh, how long is this gonna take?
You can't rush art.
Oh, no. It's closed.
We're not preschool toys, Slinky.
We can read.
-
- Hey, Joe, you're late.
- We 'vegot
a ton oftoys to unloadin the back.
- All right. All right.
- I'm comin'. I'm comin'.
- All right. Let's go.
But the sign says it's closed.
No, no, no, no. All together. Now!
-
-
Whoa, Nelly! How are we going to
fi nd Woody in this place?
Look for Al. We fi nd Al,
we fi nd Woody. Now move out!
- Woody?
- Woody.
There you go.
He's for display only.
You handle him too much,
he's not gonna last.
It's amazing. You're a genius.
He's just like new.
Wow.
I could use one ofthose.
You know, they make it so you can't
defeat Zurg unless you buy this book.
It's extortion.
That's what it is.
Hey, I always thought
the golden sector was the only--
-
-  I thought
we could search in style.
Nice going there, Hamm. So how about
letting a toy with fi ngers drive?
Am I really that fat?
-
- Ow!
- What are you doing?
- You're in direct violation
ofCode 6404.5,
stating all space rangers
are to be in hyper-sleep...
until awakened by authorized personnel.
- Oh, no.
-
You're breakin' ranks, ranger.
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
- I've got an AWOL space ranger.
- Tell me I wasn't this deluded.
No back talk!
I have a laser, and I will use it.
-You mean the laser that's a light bulb?
-
Has your mind been melded?
You could've killed me, space ranger.
Or should I say "traitor" ?
- I don't have time for this.
- Halt!
I orderyou to halt!
Listen to me.
Listen. Wait.
- We've been down this aisle already.
- We've never been down this aisle.
- It's pink.
- Face it. We're lost.
-  Back it up. Back it up.

Howlowcanyougo?
Excuse me, ladies. Does anyone
know where we might fi nd the Al
ofAl's Toy Barn?
I can help.
I'm Tour Guide Barbie.
Please keep your hands, arms
and accessories inside the car,
and no flash photography.
-Thankyou.
-I'm a married spud. I'm a married spud.
- I'm a married spud.
- Then make room for the single fellas.
To our right is
the Hot Wheels aisle. Developed in 1 967,
the original series had 1 6 cars,
including the Corvette.
I beg your pardon, ma'am,
but where's Al's offi ce?
Please hold all questions
until the end ofthe tour. Thankyou.
It says how you defeat Zurg! Look!
-Hey, get this outta here, "geek-osaur."
-Excuse me, sir.
- Look out!
- Stop, stop, stop!
-
-  Turn into the spin, Barbie!
My source of power!
No!Come back!Hey!
Wait up! Hey!
Come on! Slow down!
Dinosaur overboard!
Slow down!
Remain seated, please.
Ow! Listen to me. Listen to me.
You're not really a space ranger.
You're a toy.
We're all toys. Do you hear me?
- Well, that should hold you
till the court martial.
- Letmego!
You don't realize what you're doing!
And this is the Buzz Lightyear aisle.
Back in 1 995, shortsighted retailers did
not order enough dolls to meet demand.
- Hey, Buzz!
- Halt! Who goes there?
Quit clownin' around and get in the car!
Buzz, Buzz, I know how to defeat Zurg!
- You do?
- Come on. I'll tellyou on the way.
No, no, guys! You've got the wrong Buzz!
You've got the wrong Buzz!
Say, where'd you
get the cool belt, Buzz?
Well, slotted pig,
they're standard issue.
No!
-
It's like printing my own money.
-
- Yeah? What?
-
Oh, oh. Mr. Konishi.
Yes, uh, I have the pictures right here.
I n fact, I'm in the car right now on
my way to the offi ce to fax them to you.
I'm going through a tunnel!
I'm breakin' up!
Oh, wow! Will you look at me?
It's like I'm fresh out ofthe box!
Look at this stitching! Andy's gonna
have a hard time rippin' this! Hello!
H-Hi! Hello!
Great. Now you can go.
Well, what a good idea.
Woody, don'tbe madatJessie.
She's been through more than
you know. Why not make amends
before you leave, huh?
It's the leastyou can do.
All right.
But I don't know what good it'll do.
Hey. Whatcha doin' way up here?
Thought I'd get one last look at
the sun before I get packed away again.
Look,Jessie.
I know you hate me for leaving,
but I have to go back.
I'm still Andy's toy.
Well, ifyou knew him, you'd understand.
See, Andy's a real--
Let me guess.
Andy's a real special kid.
And to him, you're his buddy,
his best friend.
And whenAndyplays withyou,
it's like even thoughyou're notmoving,
you feel like you're alive,
because that's how he sees you.
How did you know that?
Because Emily was just the same.
She was my whole world.
* Whensomebody lovedme*
* Everything was beautiful*
* Every hour wespent together*
* Lives within my heart*
*And whenshe wassad*
* I was there to dry her tears *
*And whenshe was happy so was I*
* Whenshe lovedme*
* Through thesummerandthe fall*
* We hadeach other
That was all*
*Justshe andI together*

* Whenshe lovedme**
You never forget kids
like Emily or Andy.
But they forget you.
-Jessie, I-I didn't know.
-J ust go.
Howlong will itlast, Woody?
Doyoureally think...
Andy is gonna take you
to college or on his honeymoon?
Andy's growing up,
andthere's nothingyou can do aboutit.
It's your choice, Woody.
You can go back, oryou can stay
with us and last forever.
You'll be adored
by children forgenerations.
Who am I to break up the Roundup gang?
- Hey, Woody, are you in here?
- Nah. This one's empty too.
- Woody! Woody!
- Woody!
Pardon me, gentlemen, but have either of
you seen a cowboy doll with a bad arm?
- Why, no, I haven't.
- Hey! He was talkin' to me!
- No! He was talkin' to me!
- Why, you--
-
- You see, all along,
we thought the way into Zurg's fortress
was through the main gate,
but in fact, the secret entrance
is to the left, hidden in the shadows.
-To the left and in the shadows. Got it.
-
- Someone's coming.
- Everyone take cover.
It was a big pileup, but I don't want
to boreyou with the details.
Yes. Now, let me
confi rm your fax number.
-
- 01 1 . Wait.
That's a lot of numbers. No. I got it.
- It's him.
- The chicken man.
- Funny, he doesn't look like poultry.
-
That's the kidnapper, all right.
A kidnapper!
An agent ofZurg if I ever saw one.
And the piéce de résistance!
I promise the collection will be
the crown jewel ofyour museum.
- It's Woody!
- Now that Ihaveyourattention,
- imagine we added
another zero to the price, huh?
-
- I'll pay anything you want.
- Yes! Yes!
You got a deal!
I'll be on the next flight toJapan!
Quick.
I nto the poultry man's cargo unit.
He'll lead us to Zurg.
Move, move, move!
Don't touch my moustache!
Rich, rich, rich, rich!

Huh?
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.
-  Ha! He didn't take the bag!
- No time to lose!
He's ascending
in the vertical transporter.
All right, everyone. Hang on.
We're gonna blast through the roof.
- Uh, Buzz?
- To infi nity and beyond!
What are you? I nsane? We're
wasting time. Stand still, Godzilla.
-
- I don't understand.
Somehow, my fuel cells have gone dry.
-
-
-
- Blast. He's on level 23.
How are we gonna get up there?
Maybe ifwe fi nd some balloons,
we could float to the top.
Areyoukidding?
Isay westack ourselves up,
push the intercom
and pretend we're delivering a pizza.
How about a ham sandwich...
with fries and a hot dog?
- What about me?
- You can be the toy
that comes with the meal.
Troops!Overhere.
J ust like you said, lizard man.
" I n the shadows to the left."
Okay. Let's move!
Mission log. Have infi ltrated
enemy territory without detection...
and are making our way
through the bowels ofZurg's fortress.
You know, I think that Buzz aisle
went to his head.
Oh, no.
Which way do we go?
-This way!
- What makes you so sure?
- I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure.
-
We've been detected. The walls!
They're closing in! Quick!
- Help me prop up vegetable man,
or we're done for.
- Hey! Put me down, you moron!
Guys, look! It's not the walls!
It's the elevator!
Come on. We've got no time to lose.
Everyone grab hold!
-  What?
-  Huh?
Uh, Buzz,
why notjust take the elevator?
They'll be expecting that.
Hey, Buzz! Stop!
Slowdo wn!
To overnight six packages
toJapan is how much?
-
- What? That's in yen, right?
Dollars?
You are deliberately taking advantage...
of people in a hurry, you know that?
All right.
I'll do it! All right. Fine.
I'll have the stuff
waiting in the lobby, and you'd
better be here in 1 5 minutes,
- because I have a plane
to catch, do you hear me?
-
Whoo-hoo!
We're fi nally going.
Can you believe it?
That's custom-fi tted foam insulation
you'll be riding in, Bullseye.
First class all the way!
You know what?
I'm actually excited about this.
I mean it.
I really am!
- And why shouldn't you be?
- Yee-hah!
- Whoa!
- % Swing your partner do-si-do %
- Look at you, dancing cowboy!
- Look! I'm doin' the box step!
Uh-oh. Hey, heads up down there!
- Whoa! Pork bellies are fallin'.
- Hey, how much farther, Buzz?
Halfway there.
My arms can't hold on much longer!
Too... heavy.
- Oh! What was I thinking?
My antigravity servos!
-
Hang tight, everyone.
I'm going to let go ofthe wall.
- What?
- He wouldn't.
- One--
- He would.
- Two--
-
- Three!
-
To infi nity and beyond!
- Approaching destination.
Reengaging gravity.
-
- Area secure. It's okay, troops.
-
The antigravity sickness will wear off
momentarily. Now let's move!
Remind me to glue his helmet shut
when we get back.
How 'bout givin' me
a little intro there,Jessie?
I ntroducing the high-ridin'-est
cowboy around--
- You forgot "rootin '-tootin '-est"!
-
The high-ridin'-est, rootin'-tootin'-est
cowboy hero ofall time,
SheriffWoody!
- Say, little missy, you notice
any trouble around these parts?
-
Nary a bit,
not with SheriffWoody around.
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! I got it!
I got it! This is great! Okay!
The bandits got the critters
tied up in the burning barn,
and now for the best part!
Help us!
The barn's on fi re!
I've got ya, critters.
No need to worry.
Woody saves the day again!
- Yee-hah!
- Now, where's my trusty steedBullseye?
Ihave to ride off
into thesunset-- Oh!
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!
W-W-Watch it.
Wait. I'm ticklish, okay?
- Oh, you are?
- No, no, no. Cut it out.
Stop it. Stop it.
- No, please. No, no. Stop! Stop!
-
Mission log. Have reached
Zurg's command deck, but no sign
of him or his wooden captive.
- Please, no!
- That's Woody!
-
- This way!
Please, please, no!
Buzz, canyousee?
What's going on?
-  Take that!
-
To the left. No, your left.
- Take it up higher.
-  What's happening?
Oh, it-it's horrible.
They-they're torturing him.
-  What are we gonna do, Buzz?
- Use your head!
But I don't wanna use my head!
-
- What's going on here?
Buzz, guys!
Hey, how did you fi nd me?
- Watch yourself!.
-
We're here to spring ya, Woody!
-
- You heard of kung fu?
Well, get ready for pork chop.
Prepare to meet Mr. Angry Eyes!
Holdit, now! Hey, you don't understand!
These are my friends!
- Yeah, we're his friends!
- No, Rex, I mean they're my friends!
-
- Hey, stop it!
Leave him alone, springy dog! Hey!
- Grab Woody, and let's go!
- Fellas, hold it! Buzz, put me down!
- Quick! To the vent!
- They're stealing him.
- No!
-
- Hold it right there!
- Buzz?
- You again?
-Woody! Thank goodness you're all right.
-Buzz, what is going on?
Hold on. I am Buzz Lightyear,
and I'm in charge ofthis detachment.
- No, I'm Buzz Lightyear.
I'm Buzz Lightyear!
- I am Buzz Lightyear!
So, who's the real Buzz?
-I am!
-I am! Don't let this impostor fool you!
He's been trained by Zurg himself
to mimic my every move.
-
-  Buzz!
I had a feelin' it was you,
Buzz. My front end just had
to catch up with my back end.
Will somebody please
explain what's going on?
It's all right, space ranger.
It's a code 546.
-  You mean it's a--
- Yes.
- And he's a--
- Oh, yeah.
- Your Majesty.
-
- Woody, you're in danger here.
We need to leave now.
- Al's selling you to a museum--
- inJapan!
-  I know. It's okay, Buzz.
- I actually wanna go.
- What?
- Areyou crazy?
Look, the thing is,
I'm a rare SheriffWoody doll,
and these guys are my Roundup gang.
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?
Woody's Roundup !
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?
Woody's Roundup !
Oh, it's this great old TV show,
and I was the star. See? Now look.
Look!Look atme!
See? That's me!
- This is weirdin' me out.
- Buzz, it was a national phenomenon.
There was all this merchandise
thatjust got packed up.
Oh, you should have seen it.
There was a record player and a yo-yo--
Buzz, I was a yo-yo!
- "Was" ?
-Woody, stop this nonsense and let's go.
Nah, Buzz.
I can't go.
I can't abandon these guys.
They need me to get into this museum.
Without me, they'll go back
into storage-- maybe forever!
Woody, you're not a collector's item.
You're a child's plaything.
You are a toy!
For how much longer?
One more rip, and Andy's done with me.
And what do I do then, Buzz?
Huh? You tell me.
Somewhere in that pad ofstuffi ng
is a toy who taught me...
that life's only worth living
ifyou're bein' loved by a kid.
And I traveled all this way
to rescue that toy...
because I believed him.
Well, you wasted your time.
- Let's go, everyone.
- What about Woody?
He's not coming with us.
But-But Andy's coming home tonight.
Then we'd better make sure
we're there waiting for him.
I don't have a choice, Buzz.
This is my only chance.
To do what, Woody? Watch kids from
behind glass and never be loved again?
Some life.
- Is everybody okay?
- SheriffWoody!
- Iknewyou'dmake it!
- Now, remember, deputies,
the real treasures are
yourfriends andfamily.
Before Igo, kids, I want toshare
somethin 'special withyou,
- for the times I'm notaround.
- Good going, Woody!
I thought they'd never leave.
* You'vegota friendin me*
% You've got a friend in me %

- Buzz! Wait! Wait!
- Woody, where are you going?
You're right, Prospector.
I can't stop Andy growing up.
But I wouldn't miss it for the world.
- No!
- Buzz!
- Yes?
- Yes?
- I'm coming with you!
Wait! Wait-wait-wait-wait.
I'll be back in just a second.
Way to go, cowboy!
- Hey, you guys-- Come with me.
- What?
Andy will play with all of us.
I know it!
Woody, I-I--
I don't know. I--
Wouldn't you give anything
just to have one more day with Emily?
Come on, Jessie. This is whatit's
all about: to make a childhappy.
And you know it.
Bullseye, are you with me?
Okay, good boy.
Prospector, how 'bout you?
-
-
- Prospector?
- You're outta your box!
I tried reasoning with you, Woody,
but you keep forcing me
to take extreme measures.
Wait a minute. You turned on the TV
last night, notJessie.
Look, we have an eternity
to spend together in the museum.
Let's not start off
by pointing fi ngers, shall we?
- Youreally are Stinky Pete, aren'tyou?
-Prospector, this isn't fair.
" Fair" ? I'll tell you what's not fair:
spending a lifetime on a dime-store
shelfwatching every other toy be sold.
Well, fi nally my waiting
has paid off,
and no hand-me-down cowboy doll
is gonna mess it up for me now!
Buzz. Help, Buzz! Guys!
It's too late, Woody. That silly
Buzz Lightweight can't help you.
His name is Buzz Lightyear.
Whatever. I've always hated
those upstart space toys.
It's stuck! What do we do?
- Should I use my head?
-
-
- It's Al!
Look at the time.
I'm gonna be late!
Oh, fi gures. I can't miss this flight!
I've gotta pack.
All right. Let's see.
Uh, wallet, keys, tickets,
uh, passport, beefjerky--
very expensive over there.
Shower!
Oh, I can skip the shower.
Ijustgottaget outta here now!
Quick! To the elevator!
-
- Hurry. I can hear it coming.
So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear--
for the last time.
Aah! It's Zurg! Watch out!
He's got an ion blaster!
Quick! Get on!
-
-
The emergency hatch!
Come on!
Huh?
- Come on! Hurry!
-  But Buzz is in peril!
Buzz-- Buzz--
Buzz-- Lightyear to the rescue!
Surrender, Buzz Lightyear.
I have won.
I'll never give in.
You killed my father!
No, Buzz.
I am your father.
Noooo!
Come on!Come on!Come on!
Buzz, you could have
defeated Zurg all along!
You just need to believe in yourself!.
- Prepare to die!
-  I can't look!
Wh-Wh-Whoa!
I did it.
I fi nally defeated Zurg!
Father.
-
- Ah, fi nally!
-
- How are we gonna get him now?
Pizza, anyone?
- Go, go, go!
- Igotit!
- Buzz, are you coming?
- No, I have a lot of
catching up to do with my dad.
Good throw, son.
That's my boy. Go long, Buzzy!
- Oh, you're a great dad. Yippee!
- Farewell.
- Does anyone know how to drive?
- Slink, take the pedals.

Left is right!
Buzz, he's turning left!
He's turning left!

Woody, Buzz, that polecat Zurg
has stolen my space cows!
Andy, come on, hon.
Time togo.
- Hey, you fi xed Woody!
- Yeah.
Glad I decided not to take him to camp.
His whole arm might have come off.
Well, what do you know?
Yee-hah!Oh, Bullseye,
we're part ofa family again!
Hmm?
Uh, m-ma'am, I, uh--
Well, I just wanted to say
you're a bright young woman

Uh, " hairful" ofyarn.
It's, uh-- Whoo-- Uh--

Welcome to Al's Toy Barn.
We've got the lowest prices in town.
Everything for a buck-buck-buck.
Well, I guess crime doesn't pay.
Oh, Andy did a greatjob, huh?
Nice and strong!
- I like it. Makes you look... tough.

- You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

You saved their lives?
Oh, my hero!
- And they're so adorable!
Let's adopt them!
- Daddy!
- Oh, no.

Wheezy, you're fi xed!
Oh, yeah. Mr. Shark looked in the
toy box and found me an extra squeaker.
- And... how do you feel?
- Oh, I feel swell.
