Does he have any cameras?
It just looks like a car.
Watch your line. Step back.
And remember to keep yourself square, okay?
Play the music.
You're really good.
Thanks.
When did you learn how to ice skate?
I've been going for three years.
Really?
Is that the same SUV?
There's kind of a lot of those in LA.
Yeah, but I think that's the same one.
I've seen it.
-What are you doing?

-MARGE: Morning, Johnny.
Hey, Marge.
They're waiting for you
at the special effects studio.
They need to do a mould of your head.
The map should be under your door, okay?
Yep, okay.
All right, so, Johnny,
what we're gonna need you to do here...
You're slouching a little bit.
We'll need you to sit up a little more.
Oh, yeah. Oh, sure.
Now the most important thing to do
is to remain rigidly upright
during this entire process.
-Like this?
-Yeah. Yeah, that's good.
Good in the front for you or...
Uh, I can be.
On the left side,
let's pull this back just a little over here.
Close your eyes.
Now I'm going to have you
keep your eyes closed
and your mouth closed
for the rest of this process, okay?
Yep.
And this shouldn't take longer
than 40 minutes or so.
Oh!

All right, let's get the, uh...
Let's get the bandages ready.

-MASSEUR: Oh, they didn't tell you?
She wasn't available.
No. Come on in.
Whoa!
-What the fuck, dude?
-Oh, did they not tell you how I work?
No.
You see, I have a website
that explains my technique.
I feel that if my client's naked,
it's just more comfortable
if I meet them at the same level.
Yeah, it's not for me.
Thanks, though.
Why don't you just pack it up?
All right.
Sir, I'm sorry about that.
No, it's cool.
MAN ON TV: Gandhi advocated the boycott
of machine made European clothing.
And it caused large scale unemployment
in India.
As always Gandhi wore
only white linen cloth,
which had become a symbol
of the entire movement.
He took to making a handmade cloth
called khadi.
Most importantly,
it showed India how to be self-reliant.
Hi.
You got another cigarette?
Yeah, sure.
Hi.
JOHNNY: Oh, Shania...
SHANNON: Shannon.
JOHNNY: Shannon. Sorry.
-Hey, Cleo.
-Hey.
Why are you taking a bath next door?
Is yours broken?
Yeah. Yeah, it's been acting weird.
What a nice surprise.
Come on in. You got your stuff?
Shouldn't you be in school today?
CLEO: it's Sunday.
SAMMY: You need to hold down the...
The rhythm.
CLEO: Yeah.
SAMMY: Yeah!
Here we go.
Here we go.
-Are you using your whammy?
-Yup.
Drummers is what you do now.
Why don't you use drummers?
It's not Stewart Copeland?
Well, it wasn't that hot pretty girl.
Big lips.
Let's see what the score was.
Let's see the score.
SAMMY: Oh, God. Jeez.
-97!
-97! Whoa.
-92.
-92.
-I beat you?
-Yeah.
SAMMY: Stick to movies!
Are you kidding me?
Another actor's failed transition into music.
Oh, God!
JOHNNY: Cleo, check this out.
You don't do any sports, you just do ballet?
Mmm-hmm.
Ice skating.
And jazz dance, huh?
No.
My sister did jazz dance.
It was so stupid. I always had to watch her.
Oh, God, and her stupid leotard.
-Like this? Like...
-Yeah, she looked like...
What else do you do, do you do karate?
No.
At ballet, are you the best in the class?
I... Well, I try to be, yeah.
Ls your ballet teacher an alcoholic?
No.
I knew a girl whose ballet teacher
was this alcoholic.
I figured they all were.
It's true, like, you probably don't know
'cause you're a kid.
When you get older,
you'll realise she goes off to the back
more often than you guys think, you know.
You can smell wine on her breath.
Seriously, it's a big...
it's a big thing for ballet teachers.
It is.
You don't recognise that stuff.
Wait. Do people really...
You can't play on hard.
CLEO: No.
SAMMY: it's so hard.
-
-That's insane.
-Hello?
-MARGE: Hi, Johnny.
Hey, Marge.

Yes.
And you need to be in Milan, Wednesday.
We can fly you out tomorrow night
or Tuesday.
Are you there?
Johnny?
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm here.
We'll get you the flight options
later today, okay?
And let us know what you want.
All right. Thanks, Marge.
I'll talk to you later.
Hi, I need a few things.
Could I get three cups of milk,
a stick of butter,
some cheddar cheese.
And do you have a cheese grater
that you could bring up?
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

How about the handstand?
-That was good before.
-Okay.
Are you sleeping?
No.
You want to get a snack?
Yeah.
How can we be of service to you?
Um... What kind of gelato do you have?
Cioccolata, strawberry, pistachio e vaniglia.
Hmm. Well, we'd like to try them all.
Uh, could you send up two of each, please?
Certamente, Mr. Marco.
Thank you.
How about vanilla? Did you try it?
-Mmm. Good.
-Mmm-mmm.
Mmm.

I know you do.

And he had a scooter.
Do you like to ride a scooter?

-JOHNNY: Morning.
-Good morning.
Hi.
SYLVIA: Mmm.
The coffee's good.
Do you like coffee?
JOHNNY: it's good.

ROMULO: Hi, Johnny, welcome back.
Hey, Romulo, how are things, man?
Good. Would you like a song?
Good.
Have you ever heard him sing before?
Just wait. He's great.
Baby, let me be your loving teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be your teddy bear
Baby, let me be around you every night
Run your fingers through my hair
and cuddle me real tight
Oh, let me be your teddy bear
I don't wanna be a tiger
'Cause tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be a lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough
Just wanna be your teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be your teddy bear
l just wanna be your teddy bear
-ROMULO: Thank you very much.
-Thanks, Romulo.
-Morning, beautiful.

I have your orange juice.
Thank you.
Oh, can you bring it in the kitchen?
Yeah.
Mmm. This is so good.
Yeah, it's really good, Cleo.
-Mmm, you got the sauce perfect.
-Thanks.
It's, like, not too heavy.
Mmm.
I'm making a list
for the things I need for camp.
I have tennis racquet, tennis balls,
bathing suit, shampoo and conditioner.
What else?
-Sunglasses.
-Okay.
Bring your own soap.
So you don't get warts from the other kids.
That always happens at camp.
Ask your dad.
Maybe some snacks. You might get hungry.
You're not allowed.
Well, you can sneak a little in your backpack.
Get hungry at night or something.
SAMMY: Wow.
Oh, I like that spin move. What is that?
Chaîné turn.
SAMMY: Cool. Chainay-nay turn.
That's one of the fundamentals
of Afro-Cuban dancing, huh?
Is that what you're doing?
-Ballet.
-SAMMY: Oh, ballet.
We're almost there.
Have you read all these, Dad?
None of them.
I've got an idea. Why don't you be my reader?
You read them and tell me
if the character is any good.
I'll check it out.
Why don't we read Cleo's diary?
No.
When me and your dad
were a little bit older than you,
we got your Aunt Tiffany's diary,
and she was going through, like,
a rebellious stage.
And we read it all dramatically
to a tape recorder
and we waited until she got home.
And, it was like... It was really bad.
We put it on the stereo
and turned it on really loud.
And then we just went running.
-Oh! I got it.
-What'd she do?
She raised hell.
I just heard her screaming and crying.
I wasn't allowed over for like a month.
-They should have kicked your dad out, too.
-I got it.
We were looking for adventure, though.
-
-Oh, crap.
Oh!
Damn.
Souvenir?
-That smells.
-No, no, no.
-
-Smell it, smell it.
All right. Anybody following us?
No. The coast is clear.
Have you talked to your mom?
No, I left her a message.
How has she been doing?
She's good, I guess.
-
-Whoa!
What the... Hold on.
Damn it.
Hey. I was driving...
I need a tow.
Sunset and Sierra.
No.
Thanks.
Now what?
There you go.
This is not a good time.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
-Hey, Cleo, you hungry?
-Mmm-hmm.
-You want to go downstairs, get a burger?
-Oh, yeah.
-All right. So what do you got?
-A triple.
Get out of there.
-Two tens.
-Shuffle 'em.
Am I ever going to win a game today or...
Think I'll win? Can I win a game?
Oh, there's your outfit.
-I think that hat would look good on you.
-it's a turban.
Well, maybe we should get you
one of those for camp?
-That's embarrassing.
-
Look at their outfits.
Val Kilmer calls himself Val-ibu.
Check this out. Cleo.
WOMAN: Hi, Johnny.
JOHNNY: Hey, how you doing?
Good.
What? I don't know her that well.
-JOHNNY: The airplane!
-
JOHNNY: I used to do this. It was a lot easier.
You're getting big.
Hey, you want to stay one more day
before we go?
CLEO: Yeah.
It's that sound it makes
when we're doing good.
I like that sound.
-Okay, here we go.
-I'll let that one go.
-I got it.
-Okay.
Okay.
-How are you doing?
-I'm good.
-Can we pet him?
-Yes.
Oh, hey!
Hey, sweetie! Hi!
JOHNNY: What's that book about again?
CLEO: it's about this girl
that's in love with this guy.
But he's a vampire
and his whole family is vampires,
so she can't really be with him.
JOHNNY: Why doesn't she become one, too?
CLEO: Because she can't.
He doesn't want to turn her into a vampire.
And if she gets too close to him,
he won't be able to help himself.
Oh!
Okay.
-You need that? No?
-No.
Allow me.
-See you, Ray.
-RAY: Take care, Johnny.
Cleo, what's wrong?
Why are you crying?
I don't know when Mom's coming back.
She said she had to go away for a while.
But she didn't say
when she was coming back.
And you're always gone.
Come here.
Don't cry, honey.
Another two...
-That's a bet, sir.
-Come on.
Come on, 11.
-Seven.
-Seven.
Excuse me, sir. She can't be at the table.
She has to take a step back.
Okay. Stand over there.
-Okay, folks.
-All right, here we go. Here we go.
Come on!
All righty. Watch this.
You always want to take the full odds.
Always. it's the best bet.
It's the only bet where the house
and the player have the same advantage.
You got it?
-Okay. Got it.
-Okay, sir, your dice.
-Go hard 10. Hard 10.
-That's a bet, sir.
-I want a hard 10. Say, "Hard “10."
-Hard 10.
Hard 10. Come on!
-it's okay. it's all right.
-Four, four...
-Easy four.

We got it, we got both wins.
All right.
Have fun at camp.
-I'll see you in a few weeks.
-Okay.
Okay.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Cleo!
I'm sorry I haven't been around.
-LAYLA: Hello.
-Layla?
Johnny.
Hey.
What's wrong?
I'm fucking nothing.
I'm not even a person.
Why don't you try volunteering
or something?
No.
I don't know what to do.
I'm just... I want...
Can you... Can you come over? Just...
Can you come over?
No, I can't.
All right. Thanks.
Johnny, you're gonna be okay.
RECEPTIONIST: Hello, Mr. Marco.
How can I help you today?
Hey, is Serena around?
You know, she's not in.
Can I help you with something?
I'm gonna be checking out.
Oh, all right. Well, should we put your things
in storage until you return?
No. Just box it up
