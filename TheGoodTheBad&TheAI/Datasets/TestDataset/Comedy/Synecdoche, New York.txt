GIRL:
# And when I'm buried
And I'm dead #
# Upstate worms
Will eat my head #
MAN : --7:45 on
this beautiful, almost balmy
ELKE:
ELKE:
GIRL:
Mommy, done.
Okay.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
I tried not to wake you.
- Well, thanks.
You didn't. I just--
You know, I couldn't get up.
Caden, can you get that?
CADEN:
It's Maria, I don't want to.
Caden-- Oh, that's weird.
MARIA:
Mommy, is something wrong
with my poop?
No, honey, it's just green.
You probably
ate something green.
I didn't. What's wrong with me?
I have to get that, Olive.
You're gonna be fine, okay?
But, Mommy--
Yeah, I'll be right back, Olive.
Oh, nothing.
Just wiping Olive's ass. You?
MAN :
Oh, you're kidding.
Holy fuck.
I don't feel well.
Oh, my goodness.
CADEN:
Harold Pinter died.
WOMAN:
Well, he's old, right?
No, wait.
He won the Nobel Prize.
OLIVE: Mom.
- What, honey?
Do you need
to look at my poop?
You sure it's all right?
- It's fine, Olive. Just flush.
What if it's alive?
What if I kill it?
It's green like plants.
It's not alive, honey.
Remember the production
of
I did at Albanyfest?
Have your oatmeal, honey.
I want peanut butter and jelly.
- You said oatmeal.
This isn't a restaurant.
I don't want oatmeal.
WOMAN:
Okay. Fine.
Mommy, I'm sorry.
- They found avian flu in Turkey.
In the country Turkey,
not turkeys.
Can I watch TV till school?
- In some chickens. Yeah.
MAN: There is a secret something
at play under the surface,
Milk's expired.
WOMAN: Okay.
CADEN:
Jesus.
WOMAN: You better eat this.
- I will.
Yeah.
ELKE :
MAN :
ELKE: And how long have
you been in New York for?
CADEN: The first black graduate of
the University of Alabama died.
Vivian Malone Jones.
Stroke, 63.
Fuck!
God! Somebody! Adele, help!
Jesus, Caden, what the fuck?
I was shaving
and the thing flew off!
Oh, my God!
Jesus, look at your head.
Oh, shit.
Oh, God, I can't turn it.
Oh, wait.
Mommy, Daddy has blood.
- Yeah.
CADEN:
Will there be a scar?
Probably.
It looks like a mud flap.
I prefer there not to be a scar.
- Yeah.
That fellow is annoying.
He's in here every week,
like clockwork.
There. I think that should--
- Let's see.
What?
- Change in bowel movements?
It's a little more yellow
than usual. Why?
Yeah, I'd like you to see
an ophthalmologist.
A neurologist?
- What? No.
An ophthalmologist.
I said, ophthalmologist.
Do you hear that?
Yeah.
And today is Tuesday.
Mommy, is today Tuesday?
No, honey, today is Friday.
So, what exactly did he say?
That my pupils weren't properly,
uh, opening and closing.
Dilating.
No.
- Yeah.
I don't think that's what he said.
- Yes.
That's not what he said.
- Is it the bump to your head?
He doesn't know. Maybe.
He said he doesn't think so,
but maybe. But he doesn't know.
But maybe. Who knows?
Okay, Jesus, Caden, I got it.
He doesn't know--
- Sorry. I'm a little anxious.
Did you have to get
a shot, Daddy?
No, honey. It's the start
of something awful.
OLIVE:
Do I have to get a shot?
Course not.
Did you tell him
I have green poo?
It's fucked timing.
- Call the plumber-- Hey.
Sorry. I have rehearsal.
- Fuck.
Hey, come on.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Everybody, sorry.
How many years
until I have to get more shots?
Not for a really
long time, babe.
A million years?
Remember what Dr. Woodman said--
- Dad, what's a plumber?
Um, he's a-- He's a man--
- Or a woman, Dad.
Right. He's a man or a woman who
fixes sinks and toilets and...
Do you know what pipes are?
- No.
Hey, Jim. I had an accident.
- Like to smoke out of?
A different kind of pipe, honey.
- All right, bye.
Houses have pipes,
and they're made of...
Um, they're like tubes,
and they're behind the walls,
and they're under the floors
and everywhere.
And, um--
- What's the matter?
Every single where?
- It's okay, honey.
They just carry water
to and from sinks and toilets.
It's like in your body.
You have veins.
Capillaries.
Capillaries filled with blood.
I have blood? I don't want
blood. I don't want blood.
What are you doing?
- Trying to explain plumbing.
Well, stop.
- I can't do this now.
Don't worry,
you don't have blood.
Don't tell her
she doesn't have blood.
Caden, stop it.
- I don't want blood.
Thanks for getting me in
right away.
Was it the bump to the head?
No.
Could be, but I think we need
to get you to a neurologist.
Neurologist?
- It's a brain expert.
I know what a neurologist is.
I thought from the way
you asked--
I just thought you said
"urologist."
Why do I need to see
a neurologist?
Just for a look-see.
The eyes are part of the brain,
after all.
No, that's not true, is it?
Why would I say it
if it weren't true?
It doesn't seem right.
Like morally correct,
or "right" as in accurate?
I don't know.
Accurate, I guess?
Interesting.
MAN: Now, when you kick off, boy,
I want a 70-yard boot.
And get right down the field
under the ball.
And when you hit,
hit low and hit hard,
because it's important, boy.
There's all kinds of
important people in the stands.
And the first thing you know--
Ben?
Ben, where do I...?
Ben, how do I...?
Willy, you coming up?
Willy?
Willy, answer me.
Willy! No!
MAN: Oh, Jesus, come on.
Oh, crap.
Claire, are you okay?
What's happening here?
It's too late in the game
to have these problems.
I know, Caden. I'm sorry.
We'll get it.
Oh, my God.
- You okay?
Yeah, I think
the-- The wig--
The wig saved my life.
Yeah.
It's okay, honestly.
That was good, Tom.
TOM: Yeah?
- Yeah.
I was trying something
different.
I was crashing differently.
Ambivalently.
- Yeah, I saw that. I liked it.
Um.
Try to keep in mind that a young
person playing Willy Loman
thinks he's only
pretending to be
at the end of a life
full of despair.
But the tragedy is that we know
that you, the young actor,
will end up in this very place
of desolation.
Okay.
Uh,
that's great.
Let's try it again.
How long, David?
DAVID:
I-I think 15.
Anything?
Uh. Hm...
So now what?
Hey.
- Hey.
In search of
the elusive signal.
The signal's good here,
oddly.
That-- That is odd.
I know.
Cell phones, they're crazy.
See you in a few.
Yep.
Yeah, Dr. Heshborg said
I should see a Dr. Scoriano.
My pupils don't work.
I think
I have blood in my stool.
That stool in your office?
ADELE:
When I was pregnant with Olive.
What was it like?
I don't know.
Hopeful or something.
Like something
was gonna change.
Yeah, something did. No?
CADEN: Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
- I mean, bigtime.
I mean, maybe not as much
as I'd hoped.
I'm sorry.
That's a terrible thing to say.
There are no terrible things
to say in here,
only true and false.
Can I say something awful?
Yes, please do.
I've fantasized about
Caden dying.
Being able to start again,
guilt-free.
I know that's-- That's bad.
Caden, does that feel terrible?
- Yeah.
Okay, good.
It's a nightmare in there.
I'm sorry.
So I'm reading
Yeah?
- Yeah.
You like?
- Love.
I'm such an idiot
for not knowing about this book.
It's famous, as it turns out.
- Yeah.
You're not an idiot.
Then you say:
"In fact, Hazel, you're very
bright, and I love your eyes."
In fact, Hazel,
you're very bright.
Oh, am I?
And I love your eyes.
Do you?
Oh, you're a darling.
Then what do I say?
I can't say what then you say.
- Why?
Because it's dirty.
Could you--?
Could you step out for a second?
Go ahead.
I've seen boy parts.
:
Can I take a piss in your sink?
Yeah, sure. I guess.
We're sold out.
Great.
CADEN:
Gorgeous.
Thanks.
How was rehearsal?
Awful.
We have,
uh, 560 lighting cues.
I don't why
I make it so complicated.
Because that's what you do.
Yeah.
We got through it though.
- That's really pretty.
Caden, I'm sorry, I--
I can't-- I can't come tonight.
I'm sorry.
I have two canvasses I have to
get ready to ship for tomorrow.
I know it sucks--
- It's opening night.
I know. I wish I could come.
I would if I could.
I've gotta get ready.
- You know. Tomorrow--
I have to get ready. I don't
know what I'm gonna wear.
I have to figure out
what I'm gonna wear.
Oh, boy, oh boy.
Willy?
It's all right,
I came back.
Oh. I hated myself tonight.
Plus, I'm so-- Excuse me.
- Hey, Tom.
I'm so bloated and enormous.
No, you look good.
You were great.
I was very pleased.
CLAIRE: You okay?
Sorry. A little bit
of a headache.
MAN:
Willy Loman.
Aw.
I just wanted to say thank you
for everything.
You've been absolutely
brilliant.
It's gonna be miserable
going ahead without you.
I'll be around. I'll check in.
- I'm such a baby.
Okay. I'm gonna go get drunk,
that's what.
Okay. Claire.
Mm. Sweetheart.
Good. Good job.
Oh, don't worry,
I'll get better.
Good work.
- Don't worry, it'll get better.
Hey. I, uh--
I figured I'd better
get in fast.
Hey, you wanna--?
You wanna sit?
Yeah, thank you.
Where's
Had to work.
Uh, her show in Berlin
is in two weeks.
We're gonna go there
for like a month.
Why do I like you so much?
I couldn't begin to guess.
Me neither.
Do you get high, my friend?
You know, sometimes.
Do you want to now?
With me, in my car?
I-I get kind of, uh,
something when I'm stoned.
What does "something" mean?
You know,
bothered.
What does "bothered" mean?
You know.
Bothered. Horny.
Oh.
And me with a station wagon
and all. Could be dangerous.
Yeah, could be.
You're absolutely zero fun.
When are the reviews
gonna get here?
Don't know.
MARIA:
His best friends finger two babies--
One this big, one this big.
--and two kittens.
Hey.
Hi, Caden. How'd it go?
Hi.
- Hi.
It's late.
Maria came over
to keep me company because...
And we just lost track.
I got everything done.
But I'm sorry
I missed-- Missed your play.
I'm sorry.
But, uh, how'd it go?
Great. We're a hit.
Reviews are great.
said it was brilliant
casting young people
as Willy and Linda.
That's great, Caden. Good for you.
- Great.
I can't wait to see it tomorrow.
- That's-- Tonight.
That's great.
MARIA: Wow, it's really late--
- Early.
Early.
It's late.
- Hey, I would love to see it too.
Can we get Maria a ticket?
You're stoned.
I mean, a little.
- It's, you know-- I don't know.
But are you happy with it?
Yeah. Yeah,
I'd love for you to see--
To know what you think.
It doesn't matter what I think.
MARIA:
Absolutely. It's all about
your artistic satisfaction,
Caden.
Congratulations.
CADEN:
Yeah.
HAZEL:
I've always loved this house.
WOMAN:
Yes, it's a wonderful place.
The truth is, I never really
imagined I could afford it.
Well, the sellers
are very motivated now.
It's a scary decision.
I-- I never thought
I'd buy a house alone.
But, you know, I'm 36,
and I wonder what it is
I'm waiting for.
Home buying is always scary.
And with the fire and all
especially.
Well, it's a good size though,
not including
the partially finished basement.
Oh, I don't know.
I'm thinking I should go.
It's a perfect size
for someone alone.
I like it, I-I do.
I'm just really concerned
about dying in the fire.
It's a big decision
how one prefers to die.
Would you like to meet my son?
Derek.
Derek's living in the basement
since his divorce,
if that's okay.
Hey, Mom.
MAN:
CLAIRE:
I want just a minute.
I never...
Forgive me, dear.
I can't cry.
I don't know what it is,
but I can't cry.
It seems to me that
you're just on another trip.
I keep expecting you.
Why did you do it?
I search and I search
and I can't understand it.
I made the last payment
on the house today.
We're free and clear.
We're free. We're free.
MAN: Well done.
MARIA: Bravo.
Well done.
It was very successful.
I thought it was wonderful.
Why did the older people
look so young?
It was a choice, Dad.
I'll explain later.
I can't get excited
about your restaging
someone else's old play,
it just--
There's nothing personal
in it.
CADEN: People are coming out
of the theater crying.
Great. Be a fucking tool
of suburban, blue-haired,
regional-theater
subscribers.
You didn't you think it was long?
- No.
But what
are you leaving behind?
You act as if you have forever
to figure it out.
MAN:
ADELE: I don't know.
I slept maybe three hours.
So we're both tired.
No, I cuddled with Olive
all night. It was great.
Morning. Morning.
Morning, Caden.
I think I might have arthritis.
Friends on fire.
I'm going to.
No, I know exactly. Okay,
I will. I'll call you later.
I know. You're right. Bye.
My joints are stiff.
Who was that?
Maria.
- Right.
Hm.
- Three hours since you spoke.
Caden, I think I wanna go
to Berlin with just Olive.
I think it would be good
for us.
Oh, Christ.
Morning, kiddos.
Why don't you--?
Why don't you want me to go?
You know, I think
it would be a good thing
for the two of us to do alone.
How do you think
I'm supposed to respond
to something like that?
Want me to zip your coat up?
- Yeah.
What's wrong
with your face, Daddy?
Uh, it's pustules.
It's called sycosis.
Spelled differently than
"psychosis,"
but it sounds the same.
I don't know what that means.
Of course not.
Well, there are two kinds
of psychosis.
Ahem.
They're spelled differently.
P-S-Y is like if you're crazy,
like Mama.
S-Y is like these ugly things
on my face.
You could have both, though.
I could, but I don't.
Can I ask you something, Ad?
Have I disappointed you somehow?
I don't know what I'm doing.
We're just spending
a little time apart.
We'll talk when I get back,
okay?
Everyone is disappointing.
The more you know someone,
it just...
This whole
romantic-love thing,
it's just a projection
anyway, right?
I mean, I don't know.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I love you.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know.
We'll talk when I get back.
Okay?
MAN:
WOMAN : --and I'm on the
first train out of Palookaville.
MAN:
MAN:
WOMAN:
WOMAN:
I'm lonely.
Yes. Anything else?
I'm hurt.
- Yes. And?
I think Adele's right.
I'm not doing anything real--
What would be real?
I'm afraid I'm gonna die.
I don't know
what's wrong with me.
I wanna do something important
while I'm still here.
That would be the time to do it.
I have a book
that might help you get better.
Better?
It's called
Who wrote it?
- I did. All of these.
Wow, I never knew that.
Yes. Well, wow, indeed.
MADELINE:
That's $45.
Five. Five.
Five.
Oh. Some fives.
That's not good.
Keep with the flossing.
We'll see you in three months.
Six. Six. Six.
I'm gonna recommend
you see a periodontist.
He'll probably recommend
gum surgery.
ADELE:
Hey, I'm so glad
I finally got you.
It's Caden.
It's Caden. I can't wait to see
you and Olive on the 12th--
Have fun--
DISPATCHER:
I'm sick! I'm sick!
NURSE:
Mr. Cotard?
Mr. Cotard.
Mr. Cotard.
You've had a seizure of sorts.
- What does that mean?
Seems to be some synaptic
degradation, fungal in origin.
Autonomic functions
are going haywire.
You'll lose your ability
to salivate, cry, et cetera.
Is it serious?
We don't know. But, yes.
We'll get you enrolled
in some biofeedback program.
Maybe you can learn
some sort of manual override.
We should get a drink.
It would be fun.
It would be weird.
I like weird. I like you. See?
Anyway, I don't wanna
make you uncomfortable, I...
Okay, so I do wanna
make you uncomfortable.
# One person in a sea #
And what do we do
with all this?
You wanna come over
to my place, Cotard?
I won't let you off
the hook this time
by saying, "Never mind."
Adele is only on vacation.
She hasn't called since
she left. It's been a year.
It's been a week.
I'm gonna buy you a calendar.
Okay.
Just for one drink.
Come on. Scraps
for my scrapbook.
CADEN:
I can't, uh-- I really can't
drink very much
because of my condition.
Did you put something in it?
If that's what it takes,
consider it done.
Poof.
Love potion number 69.
It's good.
Does it make you wanna kiss me?
Kind of.
Tell me why.
Because I feel-- I feel
a lot of longing.
Beg a girl, why don't you?
Please, Hazel.
- On your knees.
What?
I want you to beg me
on your knees for a kiss.
Just for fun.
Why am I doing this?
For fun, baby.
Will you help me
forget my troubles?
Oh, kiddo.
You don't even know.
No, no, no.
What?
- I don't know.
What is it?
- I don't know, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What?
- I don't know, I'm just, um...
I'm just really confused.
I'm sorry.
I, um...
I'm sorry.
I'm really, uh--
I'm really sick.
And I think I'm dying.
I have a kid,
and I'm married.
I just thought this might
change things, you know?
I had a good time, and I think
you're a very nice person.
That is just the wrong thing
to say right now, Caden.
You should go.
HAZEL : Hazel. Uh. Leave
a message or not. It's your dime.
CADEN: Hi. You know, I haven't
heard from you in a while
COMPUTER:
ADELE:
MAN:
So, I got this MacArthur grant.
- Oh, Caden.
Yeah, a lot of money.
- You know what you're gonna do?
Theater piece.
Something big
and true and tough.
I can finally put my real self
into something.
What is your real self,
do you think?
I don't know yet.
The MacArthur is called
"the genius grant"
and I wanna earn it.
That's wonderful. God bless.
I guess you'll have to discover
your real self, right?
Yeah.
I wanted to ask you, how old are
kids when they start to write--?
There's an absolutely brilliant
novel written by a 4-year-old.
Really?
-  by Horace Azpiazu.
That's cute.
- Oh, hardly.
Little Winky
is a virulent anti-Semite.
The story follows his
initiation into the Klan
his immersion in the
pornographic snuff industry
and his ultimate degradation
at the hands of
a black ex-convict
named Eric Washington
Jackson Jones Johnson
Written by a 4-year-old?
- Jefferson.
Wow.
W-Written by a 4-year-old?
Well, Azpiazu killed
himself when he was 5.
Why did he kill himself?
- I don't know. Why did you?
What?
I said, why would you?
Oh, I don't know.
Yeah, I wanna bring my
production to New York.
Mm-hm.
And to get it seen by people,
you know, who matter.
Well--
The sooner the better.
This theater,
centrally located.
Heart of the theater district,
so, you know, great for plays.
Yeah?
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
There it is.
What was this used for?
Plays.
Like, theater plays?
:
Uh-huh. Shakespeare.
The storm.
You see, the idea is to do
a massive theater piece.
You know uncompromising,
honest. Uh...
Here's what I think theater is.
It's the beginning of thought.
It's, uh, the truth
not yet spoken.
It's what a man feels like after
he's been clocked in the jaw.
It's love in all its messiness.
You know, and I want all of us,
players and patrons alike,
to, uh, soak in
the communal bath of it,
the mikvah, as the Jews call it.
Because we're all in
the same water, after all.
You know, soaking
in our very menstrual blood
and nocturnal emissions.
This is what I wanna try
to give people.
WAITRESS: Okay, here you go.
Here's your salad.
Here's your soup.
- Thanks. Ahem.
Thank you.
- Enjoy.
What are you doing?
Salivating.
The biofeedback training.
So I was wondering
if you'd help.
In your box office?
No, as, um, my assistant.
I'm not sure I can work
with you, Caden.
I'm kind of angry.
I just wanna normalize it.
I think we'd have
a lot of fun together.
:
I miss you.
Really disturbing.
- I know.
OLIVE:
This is pink.
Yeah, that's good.
CLERK: Next.
CUSTOMER: Hi.
CADEN:
We'll start by talking honestly
and out of that,
a piece of theater will evolve.
I'll begin.
I've been thinking a lot
about dying lately.
You're gonna be fine, sweetie.
I appreciate that, Claire--
You are, you poor thing.
Yeah, well, regardless
of how this particular thing
works itself out,
I will be dying.
And so will you.
And so will everyone here.
And that's what I wanna explore.
We're all hurtling
towards death.
Yet here we are,
for the moment, alive,
each of us knowing
we're gonna die,
each of us secretly
believing we won't.
It's brilliant.
It's everything.
It's
HAZEL: Stop.
DEREK: I'm just asking.
You're so obnoxious.
- You're so obnoxious.
You do not wanna cross me.
- Don't I?
Hi, Claire.
Hi.
- Hazel.
Yeah. No, no.
- I know, I know. Hazel.
You're the box office.
Yeah, I'm the box office.
How are you?
Wonderful. You?
Yeah, yeah. I'm good.
I'm fine. Thank you.
Actually, I'm meeting
Caden here.
You know Mr. Cotard, right?
Yes, I recall Mr. Cotard.
Yeah. I'm waiting--
Oh.
- Oh.
Hey. Hey.
- Hi, Caden.
Hi, Caden.
Hi, Hazel. Hi, Claire.
Hi.
This is Derek.
Hi, Derek.
- Hi, Derek.
Hi, Derek.
Hi.
Heh.
Oh, well, we'll leave you be.
It's nice to see you again.
Take care.
Why am I bowing? Okay, bye.
That was awkward.
Yeah, I guess so.
Do you like beaver--?
So could you tell me
maybe what it is
that you want from me?
Hm?
You know, like,
from my character.
Oh. Uh...
Well, we'll build it
over time together.
You know, try to find
a real person, maybe,
to model it after.
That Hazel girl's
kind of interesting maybe.
You know, like, why--?
- Although--
Why is she still working
at a box office at her age--?
I don't know. Probably not
that interesting.
Maybe she wanted
to be an actress
but she lacked
the confidence.
Yeah, we'll talk about it.
- I'm so excited.
Really? Why?
Because I think that it's brave.
And I just feel like I'm gonna
be part of a revolution.
I keep thinking about Artaud,
you know, and Grotowski,
for chrissake.
I don't know what I'm doing.
But that's what so refreshing.
Knowing that you don't know
is the first and the most
essential step
to knowing, you know?
I don't know.
Well, I'm proud of you.
Thanks.
HAZEL: Don't say that, not to me.
DEREK: Sorry.
My mother died last night.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- What are you doing out?
Well, I-I... This is me.
Well, um...
Well, it was nice meeting you.
Oh, God, did I
just say "meeting"?
I'm sorry. I'm so stupid.
Slip of the tongue, is all.
Yeah, it's a Freudian slip,
right?
I don't know how it's Freudian.
To meet, you know?
Like, to meet.
Oh.
There she met Ralph Keene.
They fell in love, married,
and soon their first child,
Claire, was born.
I used to be a baby.
PASTOR: Claire Elizabeth Keene
was a joyous child...
I'm sorry.
- ...the apple of her mother's eye.
God, you're beautiful.
Guys And Dolls,
The Sound Of Music.
I have to fuck you.
I have to.
There will be
no other before you.
I'd like to buy a ticket, please.
- Oh.
Okay. Hold it. Ahem.
CLERK: That'll be $40.
We're not really--
We need to investigate.
You know, to really discover
the essence of each being.
Uh...
You know, I think I need to work
with both of you separately.
Davis, I'll start with you.
: I liked the beginning.
- I don't wanna see a good scene--
CLAIRE:
There's a difference
between favoring me
and pretending we've never met.
We've had Ariel. I think people
know that we've fucked.
We'll talk about your character
after we put Ariel to bed, okay?
Okay.
:
I think I made a breakthrough.
This character
is so beautiful--
Yeah, I have to go
find my daughter.
Your daughter's right here.
- My real daughter.
Excuse me?
I mean, my first
daughter, Olive.
I have to go find her.
Please don't do this to us!
She's tattooed.
She's tattooed.
Oh, everyone is tattooed.
Oh, I've never seen that before.
CLAIRE:
You have responsibilities.
CADEN: Yeah, I'll be quick.
I'll do it quick.
MADELINE:
Hi.
When you canceled, it freed me
up, so I'm traveling too. Yipee.
You know, I'm not sure
I'm getting the book.
Oh, but it's getting you.
You're almost
non-recognizable now.
Thank you.
Hi.
I don't speak German.
Yeah, yeah.
I may help you, mister?
I'm looking for Adele Cotard.
Adele Lack.
We must not give addresses
or other personal informations.
Oh. I'm her husband.
No, you are not her husband,
which is named
Gunther
I'm the father of
her daughter, Olive.
I'm sorry, I-I cannot help you.
OLIVE :
Hello.
You're here?
Yeah.
I live with Adele and Olive
and Gunther and Heinz
and Uschi and Britt.
I'm everyone's nanny.
I wanna see my daughter.
Mmm.
Yeah, they sent me.
They?
Who are they?
Who the--? Who the fuck
are Uschi and Britt?
Uh, yeah, they decided
it's not time to see you--
They decided? Who decided?
They had her tattooed.
Oh, I did that.
Olive is my project--
She's a four-year-old!
She's a fucking four-year-old!
She-- She's almost
over 11 now.
She's my muse.
I love her--
CADEN:
You don't love her!
Where is she?
What did you do
to my daughter?
Oh, God.
Death comes
faster than you think.
Dr. Williams, that was your
last patient for the day.
Jennifer, let's stop
the charade, uh?
JENNIFER:
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're actually
having an affair off set.
Palpable, huh?
Oh, okay.
Who told you?
I mean,
it's not good.
Not good,
oh, okay.
You're actors playing actors.
You're in this scene,
you're not just filming it.
You're in this scene.
MAN:
Just like that--
As you're telling him this,
you realize that you're
attracted to him also.
And how are you
gonna let him know that?
And the guilt you feel
about telling him
about somebody else
knowing that.
OLIVE:
Daddy, Daddy is mine.
Daddy can't play now, honey.
Daddy doesn't live
with us anymore, baby.
He had to go
find himself.
MAN: They still feel a little tight
in the toe.
Have an argument.
You're having an argument.
Have it.
I don't buy it.
You, sir,
are a horse's ass.
Just get the fucking shoe.
Two sizes--
Tom, don't turn
into another person
just because I say
change your action.
And this started just today?
Mm-hm.
- Never happened before.
Mm-mm.
Okay. Good.
You can get dressed.
I mean, you're a doctor,
right?
Now, am I dying?
Can you tell me that?
No.
No, you--?
You can't tell me?
I can't tell you.
No, you can't tell me
if you can't tell me?
No.
No, you can't tell me
'cause you're
not allowed to?
No.
Caden.
What are you
doing here?
Oh, I-I-I was wondering
if I was gonna bump into you.
I--
- You look great.
Thanks.
Is that a new haircut?
Yeah, for--
For a while now.
What are you doing
in New York?
Um, I'm here with Derek
and the boys.
Um, mini vacation.
The boys?
Yeah. I-I thought you knew.
How old?
Five.
Uh, twins.
Robert and Daniel
and Alan.
Ah.
Yes.
They're nice names.
Where are they?
Derek took them
to the Natural History
so I could shop.
Ah.
It's so good
to see you, Caden. I--
How are things?
You know, I, uh--
I was with Claire.
And we--
We have a daughter and--
But we're separated.
Um...
How about with you?
Good.
I have a great job
at Lens Shapers.
:
Shapers. Great.
You wear a lab coat.
It's so good to see you.
Oh, good to see you, Hazel.
Hey! Hey!
I got you.
Let me go.
OLIVE :
I wanna come back.
I wanna take care
of you and Olive.
Ariel. Ariel. Fuck.
Ariel.
No, no, no, it's so late.
Please.
Hello?
Okay.
My father died.
Oh, baby.
CADEN:
They said his body
was riddled with cancer
and that he didn't know.
That he went in
because his finger hurt.
They said he suffered horribly.
And that he...
That he called out for me
before he died.
They said that he--
He said he regretted his life.
And they said
he said a lot of things.
Too many to recount.
They said it was the longest...
...and saddest deathbed speech
any of them had ever heard.
There was so little
left of him...
they had to
fill the coffin
with cotton balls
to keep him
from rattling around.
I'm really sorry
for your loss.
Thank you.
Can you excuse me a moment?
Of course.
I need to use the bathroom.
All right.
WOMAN:
God bless you and your family.
CADEN:
God bless you.
Will you excuse me?
HAZEL:
MAN :
CADEN:
Sorry.
Caden?
Hi, Derek.
You, uh...
Just tell me what to do?
MAN : In Pakistan
today, the government--
Caden, everyone has to figure
out their own life, you know?
I just want you to look at me
the way you used to.
Oh, honey, I can't anymore.
You know I'm sorry.
I-I screwed everything up,
and I-I don't have
any courage.
And I-- And I'm sorry.
Caden.
I'm okay.
I don't want you to be okay.
I mean, I do, but I--
It just, uh...
It rips my guts out.
I'll help you through
any way I can.
And I'll--
I'll help you through too.
I'm fine.
I have Derek.
Okay, I'm going.
HAZEL:
Honey, I'm coming.
OLIVE :
Olive?
Olive.
Olive, it's Daddy.
Olive, it's Daddy.
Olive, it's Daddy!
Don't fucking stare at me!
Olive!
Get off!
It's my daughter!
That's my daughter!
Get off!
I won't settle
for anything less
than the brutal truth.
Brutal.
Each day I'll hand you
a scrap of paper.
