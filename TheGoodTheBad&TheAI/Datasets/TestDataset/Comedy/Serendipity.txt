# Somebody's gonna make
a happy trip tonight #
# While the moon is bright #
# He's gonna have

- Wooh! Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
-
- Do you want these?
- No. Please.
- You go ahead. It's the last one.
Uh, miss, do you have another pair
of these black cashmere gloves?
- Whatever's out is what we have.
- You don't have a stockroom?
- No. No. We don't have
an attic either.
- Or a basement?
Um, listen, you take 'em.
I don't need 'em.
- No, no, no.
You saw them first. I--
- Please. I insist.
- Take them. Wait a minute.
- Oh! Oh!
- Excuse me, sir. These are ours.
- Yeah?
Oh. Your gloves? How come?
They're just sort of hanging there,
sleeping with their
little price tag on.
- We were just discussing
them, all right?
- Well, I have news for you.
You can go on discussing them
long after I've paid for them.
- Calm down, all right?
- Calm down? It's five days
before Christmas.
I'm in the middle
of a New York department store.
He's asking me to calm down.
Well, these were meant to be
a very special gift for someone.
- Yeah, we put quite a lot
of thought into those.
- Isn't that right?
- Well, who were they for?
- My boyfriend.
- My girlfriend.
- Her boyfriend.
- His girlfriend.
One pair of gloves
for two people?
- This is hard to explain.
- Try.
All right.
Go ahead.
Oh. Uh, well, he is
at the present time my boyfriend.
But in 18 months--
After the operation--
- He will be--
- She will be--
My girlfriend.
Do you understand?
That didn't
really work out.
- No, but Merry Christmas anyway.
- Thank you very much.
Well, you earned these.
That was quick on your feet.
- Thanks. It was a team effort.
- Yeah, it was. It was.
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Well--
Ah, well.
# Have a yule that's cool ##
They're ready for you guys.
Thank you.
I don't know what you said
to that guy makes any sense.
- But I think we scared
the be jesus out of him.
- You were pretty fierce.
This will work, though.
This is quite a coffee.
But I'm serious about the check.
It's the least I can do.
Well, thank you, but, see,
now I have to go find
something else for my girlfriend.
- Oh, they were for your girlfriend.
- Yes, they were.
- Oh, I can't accept them then.
- Well, you have to.
Otherwise you
won't treat. Really.
Let me tell you something.
This is the ultimate blend to drink.
- Where did you find this place?
- I first came in
because of the name.
- Hmm.
- Serendipity. It's one
of my favorite words.
- It is? Why?
- Uh-huh.
'Cause it's such a nice sound for
what it means: a fortunate accident.
- Mm.
- Except I don't really
believe in accidents.
- I think fate's behind everything.
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.
- Fate's behind everything?
- I think so.
- Everything's predestined?
- We don't have any choice at all?
- I thinkwe make our own decisions.
I just think that fate
sends us little signs,
and it's how we read the signs
that determines whether
we're happy or not.
- Little signals. Yeah.
- Yeah.
Fortunate accidents.
Lucky discoveries.
Columbus in America.
- Yeah, or Fleming
discovering penicillin.
- Penicillin.
- Fleming is his name?
- Yes.
Or "Jonathan
and the Gloves."
- I don't know that one.
- You don't know that story?
It's an old
folk tale classic.
Our hero, Jonathan, goes out
in search of black gloves.
And in a perfect act
of "serendipiocity"
or "serendipaciousness,"
he runs into a beautiful, attractive
English girl with a boyfriend.
You have a boyfriend, right?
- Yeah, I do.
- That's what I thought.
- And you have the glove lady.
- Yes, I do.
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a very nice time.
- Well, I hope you enjoy the
gloves you bought yourself.
- Oh, I'm sure I will.
I usually appreciate
my own thoughtfulness.
What do you want for Christmas?
- Golfclubs.
- Oh.
So you're gonna meet
your boyfriend now or what?
No, I think he's probably
out doing what you're doing.
Getting a crush on
someone else's girlfriend?
No, I'm sorry. I just meant to say
I had a really great time.
You know, maybe you should
give me your phone number,
you know, just in case.
- In case of what?
- You know, in case of life.
I just had a great time, and I'd
never be able to find you again.
Well, if we're meant to meet again,
then we'll meet again.
It's just not
the right time now.
Maybe we were supposed
to meet on British time
and we're five hours too early.
Come on.
I don't even know your name.
My name is Jonathan.
- Does that make you
wanna tell me something?
- Yeah, it does.
Merry Christmas, Jonathan.
And thanks.
That's it?
# I can feel my heart #
- Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry about that.
- # And it's about to burst #
# I try to clean it up #
# But I just get worse #
# Wish I could fall #
# On a night like this #
- # Into your loving arms #
- I think I left a scarf.
No. Nothing down here.
Why don't you go upstairs?
- Maybe it's still there.
- Thank you.
# I thought I saw your face #
# In the evening sky #
# On a lonesome cloud #
# That was drifting by #
# I wish I could fall #
# On a night like this #
# Into your loving arms ##
Hey.
Hey.
Let's go do something.
All right.
What you wanna do?
I don't care.
All right. Come on.
Now, promise me you're not
just visiting here for a week...
or marrying somebody
to get a green card or on parole.
None of the above. You?
No, no, no. Proud U.S. citizen.
No criminal record.
So you won't tell me
your name.
Well, tell me, uh, what do you
miss most about Mother England?
I miss my mom terribly.
If I were her,
I'd miss you too.
Okay. Favorite movie.
- The correct answer
is Cool Hand Luke.
- I've never seen it.
Oh, come on. You've never seen
Cool Hand Luke?
Paul Newman?
Oh, my God. Come on!
"Failure to communicate."
Sadistic cop in sunglasses
with no name.
Reminds me of you
in that way.
Um, favorite
New York moment.
This one's
climbing the charts.
I'm flattered.
Is there anything else
you need to know about me?
Huh.
Favorite sexual position?
Oh!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Yeah, yeah. That's my favorite too.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No. Yes.
- You did?
Let's take a look at that.
- Ouch.
- Oh, Jesus.
That's a deep, deep gash.
- Gaping.
What? We'll
fix that right up.
There you go.
What? Oh, you're
looking at my freckles.
It's the curse
of the English, I'm afraid.
Fair skin and bad teeth.
No, you have great teeth.
Those aren't just freckles.
If you look closely,
you can see Cassiopeia.
- What?
- Right there.
Hold on a minute.
Okay. All right,
here's the story.
A long time ago in Ethiopia,
there was this queen
named Cassiopeia...
who thought she was the most
beautiful woman in the entire world,
and there wasn't anybody in
the kingdom who wasn't offended...
by this woman's
relentless vanity.
And then one day, she really
screwed up and offended the gods.
I don't remember what she did and
I don't remember who she offended.
But it was bad.
She crossed the line.
But anyway, Poseidon, the sea god,
punished Cassiopeia...
by placing her in the heavens
upside down on her throne,
stuck for eternity with her skirt
around her shoulders...
and all the blood
rushing to her head.
And now she's just
a constellation in the sky,
a bunch of English freckles
in the shape of a throne.
So she made
one tragic mistake.
And paid for eternity.
Correct.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Legible, legible.
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- Now, please, please.
Let fate take
its proper course.
Oh!
- That was an accident.
Write down that again, please.
- I can't.
That was a sign.
Fate's telling us
to back off.
If fate didn't want
us to be together, then why
did we meet tonight, huh?
- Gotcha.
- Well, I don't know.
- But it's not an exact science.
It's a feeling.
- Well, what if you're wrong?
Huh? What if it's all
in our hands and we just walk away?
No names, no phone numbers, nothing.
What do you think's gonna happen?
Do you think good old fate is
just gonna deliver my information...
- right to your doorstep?
- Do you know that's the best
idea you're had all night?
- What's the best--
- Here you go. Write
your name and number down.
- On a $5.00 bill?
- Mm. Just do it.
You are a strange
and interesting woman.
Now what?
Wait there.
Hey!
What the hell was that?
When that $5.00 bill
makes it back into my hands,
I'll be able to call you.
And when you hear
my voice on the other end,
then you'll believe
in fate, won't you?
##
- Hey, what about me?
- What do you mean?
Well, we have to send
something out in the universe
with your name on it, don't we?
- Come on. Isn't that
the only fair thing?
- That is the only fair thing.
What have I got, even?
Ooh. No. I have a really good idea.
- What?
- Okay.
- That's a lot of tuba.
- Okay, see this book?
Yeah.
Okay, so when
I get home tonight,
I'm gonna write my name
and number inside this book.
And then first thing
tomorrow morning, I'll sell it
to a used book store.
Which one?
You're not gonna tell me.
You're not gonna tell me. Why not?
Well, now, every time
you go past an old book store,
you're gonna have to go inside
to see if it's there.
This is just wrong.
You don't just have the most
incredible night of your life...
with a perfect stranger and then
leave it all to chance, do ya?
- Do ya?
- Come with me a second.
What, we're gonna get a room?
I'm kidding.
But I wanna know you more.
- Come on. Where are we going?
- Okay.
- Now, you stay here.
- Okay.
- No, stay here. Stay there.
Don't make me come over there.
- Okay.
All right, if we both
randomly pick the same floor,
we're meant to be together now.
You're insane.
Come on.
Okay, get in.
Take a breath, and then
when the door closes, hit a button.
- I don't understand this.
- You don't have to understand.
You just have to have faith.
Faith in what?
Destiny.
Hey!
It's Sara.
My name's Sara.
And here it is.
See? You were right.
- Uh--
- Let's go, buddy.
- We're going up here.
- Oh, that's okay.
Josh likes to ride either way.
- Don't you, Josh?
-
Don't do that!
Don't touch those!
Hey, calm down.
He's just a kid.
- Looks like we've stopped.
-
- We're going again.
- Thank you.
-
Where is she? Is she here?
- No, no. I don't think so.
Come on, Josh.
Let's go, buddy.
Okay, stay alert.
-
- Is she here?
- No, not here.
Back in the elevator.
- She's not here?
- Come on! Come on!
Move it! Come on, boy!
-
Hey, Sara. I'm sorry.
- Hey. I'm sorry.
- What?
I'm sorry.
I usually have to
beg to be a part of weddings.
And if I do get into the wedding,
of course they postponed it,
and it's overseas somewhere,
and they've canceled my passport,
and I can't be a part of it,
and it's ridiculous
and awkward and horrible.
So thank you.
I take this very seriously.
It's a gift
to be the best man.
They say that once in your lifetime,
someone comes along...
whom you're absolutely
meant to be with.
Everything feels great,
stars are aligned,
body and spirit
are in balance.
Formy friend
Jonathan Trager,
that person was me.
But as you know,
Jonny and I were simpatico.
We were brothers
from another mother.
We were friends
since freshman year.
I watched him go out
with woman after woman,
and he'd always come crawling--
he would come crawling
back to me.
- It was embarrassing.
- You loved it.
But then one night he came home
and things were different.
His adole scent dream of becoming
a documentary filmmaker
was a thing of the past.
- Thank God.
- He hardly even responded...
to my playful yet tormented
flicks of my finger...
against the soft part of his skull
as he studied for finals.
And that is because
he had found her.
The woman he was meant to be with.
And if anyone is qualified...
to know when he met his soul mate,
it would be me, his first wife.
She's smart, she's funny,
she's beautiful.
In short, she's the kind of woman
that any man would dream about.
And I think we all have.
So it is with sadness...
and fond, fond memories...
that I raise my glass...
to the new
Mrs. Jonathan Trager.
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you something. My friends,
if I had to lose Jonny to anyone,
I can't imagine
a more perfect woman than Halley.
Cheers to both of you.
- How drunk is he
on a scale of one to ten?
- Twelve.
You think we'll ever out-romance
Dean and Courtney?
- I don't know. I don't think
I've ever seen them fight.
- Me neither.
Must be a bitch
on their sex life.
We have a pomegranate souffle
which is amazing, which is
different than the sorbet.
Listen, we'd love
to join you guys,
but Courtney has to wake up,
so I got to be good.
Halley, listen to me.
It's not too late to back out.
- Good night, Dean.
- And I'm at 166th and--
Good night, Courtney.
Mama, you don't want to see this.
I need-- I need to snuggle.
- I'm gonna go sleep it off.
Listen, you're wonderful.
- Good night.
- You know what? You need me.
- Take care. Come on, hon.
You guys, listen, I hate to
tell you, but I gotta go home too.
I have to. I gotta get up
at 8:00 in the morning.
My day is crazy tomorrow.
- Come in for one drink.
- He doesn't want to come.
He doesn't have to come.
- I'll see you in about 20 hours.
- Bye-bye, dear.
- I love you, son.
- Night-night.
- George.
- Take care.
You okay?
- You better be up later.
- Yeah, why?
- Because I'm gonna come home
and get undressed...
- Uh-huh?
- and climb into bed,
- Uh-huh?
act like we just got
over a terrible fight.
See you later now.
Reading is good for you.
Knowledge.
Reading?
- Hold on, hold on. Listen, listen.
- I read it a long time ago.
- I'll throw in the screenplay to
The Bridges of Madison County.
- I saw the movie. It was great.
Okay, and--
And nothing. I mean--
I mean, I did nothing.
I-- I just let her
walk out of the party
and I didn't say anything to her.
And now she's gone forever.
I mean,
she was my soul mate.
Kenny, I honestly
think it's dangerous
to use the term "soul mate."
It implies there's
some magical element
that we have no control over,
like fate or destiny.
I think holding on to beliefs like
that stops us doing the real work.
And the fact is,
if your therapy stays on track,
I think you'll find there
are many, many people out there
you could easily be happy with.
You truly believe
all that, Sara?
Yeah. I really do.
- There you go.
- Thanks.

You got to say yes, first.

- I got it. I got it.
- Ow, ow. Ow!
- I got it.
Okay, you're not gonna
read into this, right, Sara?
- I mean, it's just
an accident, nothing more.
- No.
God. We'll
get it refitted.
It's beautiful.
I love it.
You-You get changed.
I'm gonna call Ryan,
tell him you said yes.
- Why? Was he worried?
- Not about you. About the tour.
He's hoping to fit the honeymoon
into the schedule.
How does Bora Bora sound?
Very... sexy-sexy?

Now, if you're a golfer
on a one-hour lunch break,
you'd use that time up
just getting to the nearest
course out of Manhattan.
All this was
a long overdue solution.
Formerly a dilapidated pier
and converted just five years ago,
the range offers the inhabitants
of this concrete jungle...
the chance to keep
their drives straight,
their short games accurate...
and most of all, brings the joys
and frustrations of golf...
back to city folk.
This is Nick Roberts,
ESPN News, New York City.
Superb, Nick.
We got it. Thank you.
- Artie, I gotta run, okay?
- What about the B-roll shot?
Paging Sara Lawson.
Paging Sara Lawson.
- Please come to the frontdesk.
- Could you come back and get
the B-roll on Friday?
- Yeah. Whatever you say, boss.
- Thank you, sir.
- I'm Sara Lawson. Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
- How are you?
You're down
at position number two.
Oh, right. Bad golfers
all the way down there, right?
Dude, take off.
We got it.
Well, hello,
Mr. Marrying Man.
- Hi. Uh, where's Lauren?
- Oh, Lauren took the day off.
My name is Sara
and I'm gonna cut your hair today.
You know what?
I'm not thrilled with having
that "just cut hair" look
for my own wedding, so--
- I'll just take a little bit off.
- I gotta live with these pictures
the rest of my life.
- Just a little bit.
- Please, you know, uh--
# It's you #
# And me forever #
# Sara, smile #
Whoo!
# Won't you smile
a while for me #
Forget Charles Street.
Take me to the New York Times
building on 42nd, please.
- Mm-hmm.
- # Sara ##
-
- Whoo!
I'm telling you,
I keep running into her.
I keep finding it.
It keeps happening.
She was at the golfrange.
She's a big girl now with big hips.
All right?
Then I gotta leave
'cause Sara's gonna cut my hair,
And the guy in the taxi,
he's serenading me, "Sara."
I'm telling you, the universe
keeps revealing her to me,
- screwing with my head.
- You're getting married
in three days.
- That's my point.
- It's entirely duplicitous.
Think about it. Why would you risk
your relationship with Halley...
- just to search
for some pipe dream?
- Just hear me out, man.
I'm sure that
I love Halley, all right?
And maybe every time
you fall in love with somebody,
it's a completely
different experience.
So it's a mistake to compare them.
I get it, but--
All right.
It's like Halley is
The Godfather, Partll.
She's what?
Godfather, Partll.
That was an incredible movie.
Might be better than the original.
All right?
But no matter how much you love
The Godfather, Partll,
you still have
to see the original...
to understand and appreciate
the sequel, don'tya?
Come on. Is it too much to ask from
my oldest friend to help me out?
- You've already got
the fairy-tale marriage.
- I'm the best man.
You work in the biggest
newspaper in the world.
Help me find her.
Let me tell you something.
Contrary to popular New York myth,
the Times
is not omniscient.
I need a last name.
I need a social security number.
- If we find the book--
- It-It-It's a dead end.
You know that.
- Unless we search every
book store in New York.
- You did that.
- Years ago. Do you remember?
- Maybe I missed a store.
- Maybe somebody bought it
and sold it back.
- You know what?
I don't want any part of this.
All right?
Maybe I am just getting cold feet.
I'm telling you right now,
British women do not age well.
You know, I mean, years ago,
yes, she was a luscious treat.
You know, she probably looked like,
you know, Baby Spice.
But now
she could look like--
Old Spice.
- It's a great haircut.
- Oh. Thanks.
- Tell me you love me.
- I love you.
- Tell me something romantic.
- Like what?
I don't know. Like...
how I'm the only girl in the
entire universe meant for you.
Oh, my God, the dinner!
By the way, I emptied your closet.
We gotta pack for the honeymoon.
-
- God, I hate this building.
Shut up!
Don't hit it with the thing.
-
- Jon!
- What?
I'm gonna go yell
at the super.
I don't understand
why this is going off.
- You said last week
it would be fine.
- Hey, Jon.
This place looks like
a disaster area.
- Thanks, Gerald.
- Gerald, it's in here.
I gotta get going.
Coming!
Come on! I wanna see!
I wanna see!
I thought you wanted
a round-cut diamond.
- Why? When did I say that?
- I'm not exactly sure.
- But when we were younger, I think.
- Oh, God.
When I was younger, I was gonna
marry Boris Becker, wasn't I?
- Hey, guys. What did you think?
- Hey!
Well, I mean, was that last song
really inspired by my sister?
Every artist
needs his muse.
- Who wants to hear the good news?
- Hey, I pay you for the good news.
No. You pay me
to keep away the bad news.
- Bring it on.
- Lars' dates in Stockholm
sold out in eight hours.
Wow!
That means we're gonna
have to add some more shows.
So we'll bump Paris--
Sorry. I don't wanna
spoil anyone's party,
but Lars and I have
already set the dates
for our honeymoon and our wedding,
and I've told my patients
when I'm going.
Well, baby, your patients can do
without you for a couple weeks.
He's right, Sara.
I mean, a couple of extra weeks
in Europe aren't gonna kill you.
Caroline's just pushing you
to stay longer...
'cause she wants us
to house-sit for you guys.
Yeah, thank you.
I was going to ask her
when she was drunk.
- Actually, that's a great idea.
- Yeah?
- Yes!
Come on, Kip.
Let's get out of here
before Sara changes Lars' mind.
- I said something wrong?
- No, it's--
I've just got
a very detailed schedule...
and my patients
are important too.
- I don't like changing
the dates at the last minute.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
But I really need you to approve
these T-shirt designs forAustralia.
- Oh, no problem.
- You don't mind, do you?
- Can we do this later?
- Yeah.
She don't mind.
That's chamomile
for you ladies.
- Nice and hot. Very good.
- Thanks.
Sara, it was a movie poster.
It's no big deal.
It's peculiar though, right?
Don't you think?
Look, I thought you were through
with all this New Age bullshit...
like horoscopes and feng shui
and all the crap.
Eve, for someone
who owns a New Age store,
you are alarmingly earthbound.
Oh, yeah? And for
a shrink-in-training,
you are a little bit crazy.
- I'll tell you that much.
- Excuse me.
- Do you carry the Casanova candle?
- As a matter of fact, we do.
Check on the shelf across
from the Caligula incense.
And they're on sale,
so today's your lucky day.
Great. You see,
that is what happens...
when people get hooked
on the New Age life.
They end up sitting at home
burning candles for Mr. Right...
when Mr. Good Enough For Right Now
is waiting at the corner bar.
-
- Hi. Oh, yeah.
She's a pain in the ass.
- And I gotta find her.
- I've been here three years,
so this is--
Yeah, I understand.
But your computer system
has been here for a long time.
- I think-- I think you're
just wasting my time, sir.
- No, no.
- Here's the thing.
- There's nothing I can do.
- It's very crucial.
- You cannot be over here.
You cannot come over...
- to this side of the counter.
- All right.
- Please don't cross this line.
Thank you.
- All I really need...
is if you can enter this
account number in the computer...
- and just tell me her name.
- Oh, I see.
When you put it
that way, no.
- Would 20 bucks help?
- It might if I was
a health inspector.
- Listen, this is really important.
- Oh, boy, did it again.
Crossed the line. You have to remain
on the other side of the register.
I don't wanna say it again.
Remain on that side. Thank you.
Let's bottom-line this, huh?
What's it gonna take?
I have to have the name.
Well, I was a little short
on myweekly sales draw.
- Were you?
- I'm just mentioning.
Okay. Um, I'm going
to, uh--
- Uh-uh.
- Look where my feet are.
Allright?
- Lovely choice, sir.
- Thank you.
Account number
was 029351--
I thought you said you were gonna
help with my weekly draw.
The tie's worth $95.
We're still 700 short.
- $700? That's extortion.
- 700.
That's good
salesmanship, sir.
What do I need?
Ring it up.
- Well, we have a purple tie.
What would go with a purple tie?
- Mm-hmm.
I look like a magician.
All right,
you horrible little man.
I bought the entire spring line.
Okay, you happy?
- Now, look her up.
- I already did.
It was a dead account.
There's no information
in our computers.
- You give me that?
- Hey, chase me.
- Chase you? What? Are you insane?
- Don't cross the line!
- You crossed the line!
- Stop saying that
or I will cut you!
Now, you better find a way
to help me right now!
- I can suggest another option.
- Suggest it fast.
When our customers
apply for a credit card,
the hard copies go to our
storage facility in Queens.
All you need is the account number,
which you already have,
and you can find
her application.
However, you need
an employee to get you in.
You need an employee...
to get you in.
Crocodile.
Hal.
Halley.
A natural.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Really natural.
- No, no, no. Cut, cut, cut.
- What's the problem?
The problem is you can't fend
off an army of blood thirsty
Vikings with a shehnai.
- It's illogical.
- No, see-- No, no.
You're lulling them
into submission with the music.
That's the whole point
of the song, really.
"Mystic Surrender."
You don't think he looks
like he hates the music?
No. Hey.
Hey, baby.
- Now, this guy, he's-he's like
Alec Guinness. So good.
- Yeah.
Star Wars.
Obi-Wan.
All right, right here,
what are they doing?
What's their attitude?
- Whatare they thinking?
Whoare thesepeople?
- They're in awe and speechless.
And they're just grateful.
Underfed. Underpaid.
Why don't they ask me to stay
in the village and have a feast?
Yeah. Sara, hey.
- Can we talk for a sec?
- Sure.
Okay, yeah, I'm going
to split, guys.
Lars, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna talk to the director...
and I'm gonna have him
tweak that whole section.
- It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
- Tell him about the feast.
- What's going on?
- I lost my keys yesterday.
- Oh, that's a drag.
- And I've just
found them in the freezer.
I don't get it.
Is that a joke?
No, Lars,
it's not a joke.
I feel like
I'm losing my mind.
It's the wedding plans
and the tour and my patients.
It's just a bit
too much to deal with.
Okay, Sara, look. We're leaving
for Toronto in the morning,
- so don't fall apart on me now.
- I know, I know, I know.
And that's why I think
I need a little break.
What do you mean,
a little break?
No, not that kind
of little break.
I just mean a weekend away
to recharge my batteries
and clear my head.
Hey, this has nothing
to do with the other night.
I just need this.
I need it for me.
But I won't go
unless you say it's okay.
- It's okay.
- Thank you.
Okay. Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Oh, I don't know.
New York, maybe.
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, my God.
Are you serious?
Get out of town.
Yeah, that's the idea.
- Thanks. Talk to you soon.
- Okay.
This is unbelievable.
Sara, really, this is
way too generous of you.
Oh, come on.
Can't a girl do something nice
for her friend on her birthday?
There's no ulterior motives?
Well, yeah.
I'm getting married in a week
and I'd just like to have
one last fling...
with my best friend
before I walk down the aisle.
- It's so sweet. But, you know,
you're really not my type.
- Oh, thanks.
- We're going to New York?
- Yeah. Yea!
# I want you
to get together #
# I want you
to get together #
#I want you
to get together#
# Put your hands together
one time #
# I want you
to get together #
# I want you
to get together ##
Hey! Excuse me.
- Why so tense?
- Because you're
freaking me out, all right?
- Is there another space
you can be in?
- Oh. Excusez-moi.
- Uh-huh.
- And what is it you do?
Why, my sales clerk friend,
I happen to write for
a little publication.
Maybe you've heard of it.
It's called the New York Times.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
-
Hello. Who?
Dean? And who may
I say is calling?
Huh? Hang on.
Your editor.
Hi. No.
Didn't get a chance
to write that one. Uh--
Didn't write
that one either.
Uh, with all due respect, sir,
they'll all still be dead tomorrow.
Okay. Thank you.
Bye-bye.
- You write for the obituaries.
- Absolutely. Yeah.
- You must be very proud.
- Uh-huh. I'm the one
with the last word.
- Not tonight. I don't think so.
- Yes, I am. Absolutely.
- Fat chance. Last line.
- Still talking. Yeah, right here.
I don't know. I don't know.
My eyes are killing me.
- Tell me these numbers match.
- I'll tell you.
- Let me see.
- Don't do that.
- Ah-ah!
- Is it 0293?
Congratulations.
- You got it?
- I think you found her.
Too bad the last name's
completely smudged out, though.
Well, it's his fault.
It was his thumb.
When he grabbed it, his thumb
went right across the name.
Completely. I'm kidding.
It was smudged in my hand.
- Would you stop it?
- It's just a little joke.
That's carbon paper for you.
I guess that's why
America rejected it.
- What's that address?
Is that her address?
- That's seven years ago, man.
So go to the building
leasing office...
and you'll find out
who lived there seven years ago.
It ain't rocket science.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Where to?
- Yeah, where are we going?
- Uh, okay, take us...
anywhere in New York.
- Excuse me?
Anywhere. Wherever
you feel like going.
- That's not a destination, lady.
- Wait. You didn't make reservations?
- Um, okay, Eve, please
don't get mad at me.
- What?
Oh, no.
I cannot believe this.
I need
a borough here, ladies.
I was gonna tell you
when we got on the plane.
You know what?
That's really sneaky of you, Sara.
- I'm not a bloody psychic.
- Eve, wait!
Wait!
- Eve. Eve!
- You tricked me.
I knew you wouldn't come
if I told you the truth.
I needed my best friend with me.
What are you doing, Sara?
Honestly, Sara, I don't
understand you anymore, okay?
Please, tell me something.
Tell me anything that makes
just a little bit of sense.
I've just spent
the entire flight...
staring into the sky,
thinking.
Not about my fiance,
but about this mystery guy...
I met a million
and a half hours ago.
A guy I don't even remember,
except for this...
vague picture I have
inside my head.
It was just a few seconds.
A fragment, really.
And it was like...
in that moment,
the whole universe existed
just to bring us together.
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm gonna let fate
take me wherever it wants to go.
Because when all this is over,
at least I'm never gonna have
to think of him ever again.
Let's just pray
he's a bald fascist...
who picks his nose
and wipes it under the car seat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Could you hold on?
Where are you going?
You better be buying me one
frigging big birthday cake,
that's all I gotta say.
Could I get your
destination, please?
- The Waldorf, I guess.
- Finally she gets it.
Okay, we are going...
that way.
And I'm gonna follow.
You can do it yourself. Just open up
the computer and look into it.
- I'm not even sure that I can
give you this information.
- If you can't, why can't you?
Because I'm just a temp, okay?
I don't know the rules.
Couple of months out of college,
you're acting like you're
part of the establishment.
No, no, no, no, no--
What about privacy law, huh?
Forget about privacy laws.
You know what privacy laws do?
- No.
- They protect millionaires.
Do you know who those are?
- Who?
- Tell him who they are.
- Tell him.
- Kids your age.
Pimple-faced college dropouts who
have made unhealthy sums of money...
forming Internet companies
that create no concrete products,
provide no viable services and still
manage to generate profits...
for all of its lazy, day-trading,
son-of-a-bitch shareholders.
Meanwhile, as a tortured member
of the disenfranchised proletariat,
you find some altruistic need
to protect these digital
plantation owners?
Wow. Come on.
Come on.
- You guys want the tenant
on record in 1994?
- December, to be exact.
- There's your tenant.
- Sebastian Mig-non?
No. Mignon.
It's French.
No, we're looking
for someone named Sara.
You got the right one?
- Maybe he was her boyfriend.
- Thanks.
- You did the right thing.
Really, you did.
- Goodwork, pal.
You got it.
M-I-G-N-O-N.
You got it?
There you go.
- Thank you so much, Sally.
You gotta love her.
- Where is he?
- Brooklyn.
- Okay, let's, uh--
let's grab a subway.
Wait a minute. Wait. Aren't you
forgetting about something?
- What?
- Wedding rehearsal.
Bachelor party.
- Plenty of time.
Plenty of time. Come on.
- You sure?
- Yes. Gotta go to Brooklyn.
Come on.
-
Prada!
Oh, my God!
Ooh! Prada!
Ooh, I love this stuff.
- That's $20.
- Twenty bucks?
Eve, that's
a horrific knockoff.
At least my fake says "Prada."
Yours says "Prado."
Yeah? Well,
I say for a dollar,
I can buy a little
Magic Marker and fix that.
I'll take it.
Twenty bucks?
Right back here.
Here you go.
Two buckets of balls for the price
of one at the Chelsea Piers today.
- So where are we going to now?
- I don't know.
- Lady, lady, you're a golfer?
- I feel like I feel something.
- Two for the price of one.
- Right where I'm standing.
Hey! Who are you?
Can you believe that?
Two bucket of-- Whoa!
- Will you help me up, ma'am?
Yeah, yeah, help me up.
- Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?
- Is the ball okay?
- Yeah, the back of the head.
Is that all right?
- Oh, my. Goodness gracious.
- I'm all right.
Can you get the flyers?
- Here you go.
- Taxi!
- Sara!
They should
make pills for this.
He's gotta be here.
He's got to be here.
I can feel it.
- Excuse me. Miss?
- Yeah?
- You're blocking my shot.
- Oh.
Oh. Sorry.
This is Nick Roberts,
ESPN News, New York City.
- Oh!
- Do you know
who plays golf?.
Guys who are too fat
to play tennis.
Like that guy.
Well, this is a special occasion.
After all, how many times in your
life is your son gonna get married?
Well said.
- You wanna know
why I love this game?
- No. Why?
I'll tell ya.
You can take years off from playing
and still come back strong.
Well, me, I haven't played
in over five years.
You're kidding.
- Ow!
- Ooh!
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.
- Sorry up there.
- Eve, look out!
- Go.
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I'm, so sorr-- Are you okay?
Please say something.
Say something.
I think I swallowed a filling.
Thank you for letting us in.
Now, Mr. Mignon,
we have an odd and some what
personal question to ask you.
Mignon.
Mr. Mignon.
Mignon. Like the meat.
Mr. Mignon, a few years ago,
did you live with a girl,
first name Sara?
Attractive, dark hair,
kind of, like, mysterious,
you know, really amazing...
- girl.
- Oui.
- Do you know where we can
locate this individual?
- No, I do not.
- Do you remember her last name?
- No.
Oh, come on. You don't
even remember the last name
of your ex-girlfriend?
- I find that hard to believe.
- You don't understand anything.
She was not my girlfriend.
She was just, uh, a roommate.
She stayed with me
for a very short period of time.
- She was placed with me by--
- A roommate finder's service?
Oui. She stayed with me with
her boyfriend for a few months--
- I don't care about him.
- And then he moved out
very quickly.
And at the end of the year,
she moved out too.
Yeah, but did she
leave anything behind,
maybe with her last name on it,
like a receipt, a bill?
- Like a piece of luggage?
- No. No, no.
Anything would help,
really. Anything.
I remember she sat on me.
She-- She sat on you?
Yes. She sat on me
for a while.
I found her...
inspiring.
I guess that is why I started
painting her in the first place.
Oh. She sat for you.
I'm sorry.
That is what I said.
- That's what he said.
- That's what I said.
Clearly.
Do you happen
to have the painting?
Hey, now you're gonna see
what it's all about.
You know, you see her face.
Okay. Yeah.
This is her, yes?
Yeah, sure.
Around the eyes a little.
I mean, I'm definitely getting
the British thing, you know,
with the crown and the scepter.
- Do you have a name for
the roommate finder's service?
- They would have the information.
No, I do not.
But if it helps, I do remember
where the service was located.
- Absolutely!
- Yes! Where? Where?
- Manhattan.
- Where in Manhattan, Mr. Mignon?
On 60thStreet.
- East side or west side?
- It was just next to that--
on the left of that
splendid little patisserie,
Serendipity.
That'sit.
Get-- Get ready.
Happy birthday.
It's on the house.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Oh, I'm a god-awful friend.
- No, you will be if you sing.
-
Eve, thanks so much
for coming with me.
You're welcome.
Sara, you know,
it's a wonderful thought.
The idea that all of life,
that every single event
is part of some master plan...
designed to lead us
to our universal soul mate.
But if that's really true,
then what's the point of living?
Or making decisions?
Hell, why should we even
get out of bed in the morning?
For the cake?
No. Not for cake.
So that you make mistakes.
Mistakes like this trip.
And if you're smart enough,
you learn from your mistakes.
You figure it out.
You-You think.
You realize that life
isn't some elaborate stage play
with directions for the actors.
Life's a mess, Sara.
It's-It's
chaos personified.
I have to give it
all up now, don't I?
Sara, you have a fiance who,
despite his weird
Eastern music,
which we hope is
just a phase, let's hope,
loves you
very, very, very much.
It's not giving up.
It's growing up.
Let's get out of here.
Yeah.
- Here's one.
- Ooh, catch it.
- It's a bridal shop.
- Oh, my God. The irony.
- Wait right here.
I'll be right back. Stay here.
- Why?
- Time, please?
- Uh, about 7:30.
Right. Right.
They moved downtown. If we get lucky
with traffic, we can still hit it.
- What time is rehearsal?
- Can't do it.
- Taxi!
- It's over, man.
What?
- What are you talking about?
- How can I ignore that?
"Bless the goddamn bride"?
- What?
- It can't get
any more clearer than this.
I'm not supposed to be doing this.
It's not in the cards.
Hey, it's another
one of your clues, man.
Let's talk about it in the cab...
- on the way over.
- It's not a clue. It's a sign.
- What's the difference?
- A clue is what a detective
uses to find a suspect.
The receipt, the warehouse,
that French guy-- those
are clues. This is a sign.
Me never finding the book,
that's a sign.
Sara never finding the $5.00 bill,
that's a sign.
How could something
not happening be a sign?
Maybe the absence
of signs is a sign.
Isn't it?
That's lucid.
Look, I don't know, man.
Maybe there is no fate.
And if there is,
it's not working for me.
You know, it's not actually supposed
to end this way, by the way.
We're supposed to pull the curtain
and see the wizard, all right?
- Get to the end of the river.
- This is the end of the river.
My wedding rehearsal...
starts in less
than an hour.
- My bride is waiting for me.
- Let me ask you something here.
If Sara were here right now,
poof, came down, what would
she tell you to do?
She would tell me to run,
not walk to the Waldorf...
because all the signs
point to me getting married.
Look. Wedding dress.
Lots of white.
- I hate to state the obvious--
- State it.
If you don't do this,
you may never find out who Sara is.
Maybe I was never
supposed to.
Maybe all this
is just a maze...
designed to lead me directly
back to where I started.
Which is getting married.
They should make pills
for this.
- Halley?
- Oh, my God. Eve!
What a crazy coincidence!
How are you?
- Good.
- Oh, my God.
Sara, can you believe...
that I was Halley's R.A.
in college?
Isn't that funny?
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Sara.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.
Oh, my gosh. What's it been,
like eight or nine years?
Eve was, uh--
I went to B.U. with Eve.
- Well, isn't that wonderful?
- Yeah. How about that?
So what are you doing here?
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- You are? Congratulations.
- Congratulations.
- Wow!
- Thanks.
- In this hotel?
Yeah, at noon.
We're going to rehearsal.
Why don't you come watch?
- Why don't you go?
- Okay, sure. I would love
to come and watch.
And you can bring your...
partner if you want.
- Oh!
- Oh! No, no.
I have to go upstairs
and call my fiance-- who's a man.
Oh! You must be
very proud.
- Okay, so have a good one.
I'll see you later.
- Okay, good.
Good-bye,
my sweet lesbian lady lover.
I'm just kidding.
It's just a joke between us.
Lars?
What are you doing?
- How did you know where I was?
- Intuition.
Really?
No. I went through
the New York Hotel Guide.
Alphabetically, in reverse.
I started with "Z."
Sara, I missed you so much.
I'm sorry. I don't blame you
for running away.
I was so... focused
on the album, the video.
l, Jonathan, take you, Halley,
to be my wife,
and I promise to love
and sustain you...
in the bond of marriage
from this day forward.
And obviously, Jonathan,
you'll be looking at Halley.
-
- And that's when the actual
ceremony will conclude.
- Excuse me. I need
some help over here.
- What?
And then--
then you're married.
Hal, who's that girl
over there?
- Oh, that's my old friend Eve.
- Oh.
Okay, everyone, that's a wrap.
And now make sure to
be here tomorrow morning
at 9:00 sharp for pictures.
I hate to break up a good thing,
but we have some strippers
waiting for us. We're late.
- You mean "exotic dancers."
- No, no. I mean "strippers."
- The women who take off everything.
- I'll see you men at 9:00.
But remember, I promised Judy
I'd be home by 10:00.
Fantastic. It gives you
an hour to get crazy.
Let's get into it.
Before you take Jon and Dad off
to your male-bonding ritual,
I need to talk to him.
Okay. Beautiful bride.
I'll be in the cab.
- Hi.
- I want you to meet Jon.
- Hi. It's so nice to meet you.
- I would love
for you to come tomorrow.
- We'd feel terrible if you didn't.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- That's so sweet.
It's tomorrow at noon?
Yeah, and you can bring
your friend if you want.
- Okay. I'll be there.
- Be there.
Thank you.
That's so nice.
- See you tomorrow.
- Nice to meet you. Bye. See you.
- Halley, what is it?
What's wrong?
- It's you.
- What do you mean, it's me?
What did I do?
- Nothing, exactly.
It's just this feeling
I have, like--
like you've been somewhere else
for the past few days.
- That's not true.
- Don't lie to me, Jonathan.
I've dreamed about this
my entire life, and-and...
I've imagined the dress
and the flowers...
and even the music
the band was gonna play.
And everything is exactly the way
I want it, except for my fiance,
who's just decided to float off
to Never-Never Land.
Look, maybe I've been a little bit
out of it the past week,
but it's just normal,
you know, guy stuff.
- It's a little cold feet.
Doesn't mean I don't love you.
- Well, call me crazy,
but I'd like
my fiance's feet to be warm,
especially when we're hours
from going down the aisle.
I'm sorry, Hal.
Really, I am.
Whatever it is that
you're holding on to,
please just let it go.
Please.
I think it already
let go of me, okay?
Wait.
- What's this?
- What do you think?
It's the traditional
groom's gift.
- I got yours,
and I forgot to bring it.
- I know. It's okay.
Open it.
It's a first edition.
It's just that every time
we go into a bookstore,
you're always flipping through it.
And I checked this week.
You don't even have a copy.
What's wrong?
Don't you like it?
It's perfect.
It's an excellent choice.
# When you know #
# That you know #
# Who you love #
# You can't deny it #
What's going on?
Are you all right?
Her name's Sara Thomas.
What?
How did--
Halley gave it to me
as a wedding gift.
# Never let him go #
# 'Cause you know #
# And you know
that you know #
Sally?
It's Dean from obits.
Hey.
I need an address for a Sara Thomas.
S-A-R-A T-H-O-M-A-S.
Uh, I got
an old phone number.
Yeah, we'll hold.
Hang on.
Sir, can you pull this thing over?
I can't hear a thing.
Honey, just one second.
Okay, go. What?
What?
We have to cancel
Dusseldorf. Why?
We have to cancel Stockholm?
# You can feel
love's around you #
# Like the sky
round the moon #
# This is how
love has found you #
# Now you know
what to do #
# When you know ##
Oh. Look at those stars.
They all have names,
you know.
I don't know
what that is.
It's Cassiopeia.
The... stars in the sky.
It's Cassiopeia.
You realize with the time delay,
if our return flight takes off
more than ten minutes late,
I miss my own wedding, okay?
- Does that bother you
in the slightest?
- You are a jackass.
- Well, thank you.
- You are. You--
Y-Y-You're my hero,
you know?
You're like my oracle
and shit, you know?
You're out there, man,
and you're making it happen.
Courtney moved out.
- What?
- Yeah. It's-- Look, man.
We'd been fighting
for a really long time.
Why didn't you tell me?
We didn't want to ruin
your wedding, man.
- Didn't want to rain
on your parade, man.
- What the hell happened?
We just--
We let it slip away,
you know?
That's the point. It--
You know, it died.
- We died.
- What was the cause of death?
Not enough of all of this,
of this, of this.
And not enough,
you know? Do you--
Do you remember
the philosopher Epictetus?
You remember what he said?
He said, "If you want to
improve, be content to be
thought foolish and stupid."
That's what you've done.
- I work hard at it.
- Now I want to be a jackass.
You know?
You're the shit!
That would be me, the shit.
Yeah. He's the shit. Okay.
##
You know what, old buddy?
On second thought,
maybe you should call first.
- What are you talking about?
- Give her a ring.
It's more polite that way.
Calling her gives her
a chance to clean up.
I don't care how clean
her house is!
- She might.
- What are you talking about?
- You told me to go!
You said I was your hero!
- I forbid you to look.
- You can't look!
- Why are you hanging on?
- I don't want you to get hurt.
Don't get hurt!
- You're hurting me!
I think that went very well.
Didn't-- Didn't she say that
everything happens for a reason?
- Yeah, she did.
- Well, maybe we're
laying here because--
Because why?
Because you don't want to
be standing somewhere else.
I see. Yeah.
We're crawling. We're crawling.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.
I'm sorry to report that we're gonna
be on the ground a little longer...
due to some bad weather
heading this way.
The air traffic controller
has put us on hold,
so in the mean time,
I've asked the cabin attendants
to start the movie.
- Hey, you getting ready?
- Yeah.
You know me.
I love a good wedding.
- So have you talked to Lars?
- Yeah.
We spoke this morning
before he left.
I think he's gonna be okay.
At least I hope so.
Of course he's gonna be okay,
and you're gonna be okay too.
Yeah?
Oh, you know what?
There's a lady glaring at me.
I don't think I'm supposed
to be on the phone.
Can I call you when I get home?
Have a safe flight, okay?
- Lots of love. Bye.
- Headsets?
- Yes, I will.
- $3.00, please.
What the hell is this?
Something the matter?
Yes. I think I've mixed up
my wallet with my friend's.
Yes, I have.
See? Prado.
Oh. Well, is there
any money in it?
I'll have a look.
Yes, there is.
Thank you.
Two ones... and a five.
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you.
- Uh, sorry. Excuse me.
- That's this gentleman's change.
- Jonathan. Jonathan.
- Excuse me. I just--
Sorry. You know what?
I'm going to--
Thank you. Excuse me.
Sorry. Whoo! I'm sorry!
Hi. Yeah.
It's in New York City.
I need the address
of a Jonathan Trager.
Yeah. T-R-A-G-E-R.
Thank you.
Hi. I'm looking
for a Jonathan Trager.
Is this his building?
- You must be late.
- Late for what?
The wedding.
Waldorf-Astoria.
- He's getting married?
- Might be already.
- Wait! Hey, wait! Wait!
Excuse me!
-
Sorry. Can you take me
to the Waldorf-Astoria
as fast as you can go, please?
Can you see what it is?
Oh! Sorry. Sorry!
Oh. Oh, please, God, no.
- Stop!
- Stop?
Is it over?
- The wedding?
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
It's over, all right.
Butdon't worry.
You'll get
your present back.
- Excuse me?
- They always return thepresents.
You asked
if it was over.
The truth is,
it never even began.
- What?
- Yeah. He called the whole
thing off this morning.
He called it off?
That's terrible.
Were you a friend
of the bride?
Or the groom?
- What's up with this weather?
- What happened to spring?
- So, what kind of
pep talk do you want?
- What do you got?
Well, I've got the inspirational
"You can achieve anything
you dream about."
It's very popular,
but not appropriate for this.
Of course, there's the "Don't worry,
there's more fish in the sea" pap.
- No.
- Uh, we can always
fall back on the classic...
"When God shuts a door,
he opens a window."
How about telling me
I did the right thing?
I don't have to tell you.
I wrote it.
- What's this?
- It's your obituary.
- Nice.
- Turns out I had writer's block...
penning your best man speech,
and that's what ended up coming out.
Blame it on the day job.
- Twenty, right?
- Thanks.
- You going to see Courtney?
- Absolutely.
I needed this.
You know, the Greeks
didn't write obituaries.
They only asked one question
after a man died:
"Did he have passion?"
How do I look?
Like a jackass.
- Good luck, man.
- Thank you.
Jonathan Trager,
prominent televisionproducer
for ESPN,
died last night from
complications of losing
his soulmate and his fiance.
He was 35 years old
and soft-spoken and obsessive.
Trager never looked the part
of a hopeless romantic.
But in the final days
of his life,
he revealed
an unknown side of his psyche.
This hidden
quasi-Jungian persona...
surfaced during
the Agatha Christie-like pursuit
for his long-reputed soulmate,
a woman whom he only spent
a few precious hours with.
Sadly, the protracted search
ended late Saturday night...
in complete and utter failure.
Yet even in certain defeat,
the courageous Trager
secretly clung to the belief...
that life is not merely
a series of meaningless
accidents or coincidences.
Uh-uh. But rather
it's a tapestry of events...
that culminate in
an exquisite, sublime plan.
Asked about the loss
of his dear friend, Dean Kansky,
the Pulitzer Prize-winning
author and executive editor
of the New York Times,
described Jonathan as a changed man
in the last days of his life.
"Things were clearer for him, "
Kansky noted.
Ultimately, Jonathan concluded
that if weare to live life
in harmony with the universe,
we must all possess a powerful
faith in what the ancients
used to call "fatum,"
- what we currently
refer to as destiny.
- Destiny.
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.
I guess I'm just gonna
try and find him or something.
I don't think you should do that.
I really don't.
- Well, what do you think
I should do?
- Just be here.
- I feel it.
I feel it in the air.
- Eve, what's happened to you?
You've become your own
worst nightmare right there.
Bye.
And please put a jacket on.
It's freezing out here.
