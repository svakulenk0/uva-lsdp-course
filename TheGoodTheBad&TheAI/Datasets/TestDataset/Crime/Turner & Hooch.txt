The sleeve attaches
to the Pendaflex folder...
between the second
and fourth slots from the Ieft.
We've done the same
with one of these peel-off stickers.
It goes right on the file folder.
Now, each file folder needs to go
into its own Pendaflex folder.
You have to make sure
it's the appropriate Pendaflex folder.
Wh-Why does it have to be on the inside
folder and the outside folder ?
- The case number ?
- Yes.
Because it's the key to
the entire system.
It also goes on the report.
AII pages.
You punch it with
a two-hole punch.
You attach it to the file folder
on this two-prong fastener.
- That way, nothing ever gets Iost.
-
Now, misdemeanours go in here.
-
- And felonies go in there.
Hey, plenty of room in there.
Why do you think I'm Ieavin' ?
Caseload number's also
on the daily caseload sheet.
And today, for example,
we have two-- count 'em, two-- caIIs.
Both of 'em down at the pier.
If we drag our feet,
they can carry us through to Iunch.
- Happy Birthday, Katie.
- Thanks, Scott.
Hey, could you give me a caII
sometime today on the radio ?
- CaII you ? About what ?
- I don't know.
Make something up. I'm beginning
to think the damn thing's busted.
Police officer !
Out of my way !
- Mornin'.
- Mornin', Petey. Dave !
Scott ?
Scott ?
Scott, I made some muffins
for you to take with you.
Oh, you didn't have to do that,
Mrs Remington.
God bless you in that awful city.
We're aII hoping that
you don't get shot.
Poor boy.
-
-
What ?
Seat belt, seat belt, seat belt.
It's the Iaw.
-
- Thank you.
- Ah-ah-ah-ah.
- Oh, come on, man.
I can't sit here and smeII these
without havin' at Ieast one.
AII right, aII right,
aII right, aII right.
- Just make sure it's just one.
- Thank you.
- How many days do you have Ieft ?
-
- Three.
- Good. Real good.
- Why ? Am I getting on your nerves ?
- Oh, no.
I mean, I really appreciate your
showing me the ropes this week--
lettin' me ride around
in your nice, clean car,
and treating me Iike
a fuII-fledged detective.
- Investigator.
- Whatever. But, Scott, when
are you going to Iearn to relax ?
- I am relaxed.
- Mm-mm.
I'm not talkin' about the smaII "R."
I'm talkin' about the big "R."
You know, "Top of OId Smoky."
- You mean, when am I going to get Iaid?
- Hey.
Oh, weII, I-- It's already been
four times this morning.
I'm exhausted.
Okay, come on, boys.
Mama's gonna be mad.
- Mr Boyett.
- Hey, Scott. How are you doing ?
I hear we're Iosing you.
Ah, yeah, 'fraid so, 'fraid so. This
is David Sutton. He'II be replacing me.
- Mister Boyett.
- Come on, boys.
Uh, we came down to teII you that--
That they found your dinghy
over in Moss Landing.
You should send somebody
to go pick it up.
Yeah, weII, thanks. I never thought
I'd get to see that again.
Hey, Scott, could you, uh,
show the boys your, uh, badge ?
- They never saw
a detective's badge before.
- Sure.
- He's a detective ?
-  Nope, an investigator.
- I don't know, Dad.
Looks kind of fake to me.
-  Fake ?
Hey, kid, you wanna
spend some time in jail ?
- Cute kids.
- Yeah, weII, yeah. Kids.
Need four hands !
Amos !
-
- Amos !
-  Who's there ?
- It's me ! Scott !
Oh. Let me get a Ieash on him.
Yeah, do that !
PIease ! Thank you.
- Amen.
-
Here's the muffin for Hooch !
I brought a muffin for ya !
The muffin, Hooch !
Hooch, the muffin !
The muffin, Hooch !
-
-
-  Medic !
-  Hooch ! Come here !
Amos ? Amos.
Let him go, Hooch.
Let go of him, Hooch.
- Hooch. Drop him. Drop him, Hooch.
-
I-I'm sorry, Scott. I don't
have the hand strength I used to.
- You're okay, aren't ya ? Huh ?
-  Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
I was Iookin' forward
to a nice, quiet cup of coffee.
- But now I'm awake !
- Don't let him see that you're angry.
H-He has a sensitive spot.
He reacts real bad to anger.
What is the matter with him ?
I brought him a muffin. He knows me !
What, "know ya" ?
He didn't even break the skin.
Why, this dog Ioves ya, boy.
Let's go on up to the house
and we'll aII have a cookie.
Come on, Hooch.
Let's go, boy. Come on.
Doc says I shouldn't
give him these chocolate chips.
Uh, what do you say
about that, Hooch ?
I thought so.
WeII, I'm here, Amos.
What's the complaint this time ?
Them.
That seafood plant.
There's somethin' goin' on over there.
-  Oh, they're okay,
other than a stolen dinghy.
- No, it isn't.
It's worse than it was before.
There's always some strange noises
goin' on at night.
WeII, you're always teIIing me you
don't hear Iike you used to any more.
WeII, I don't hear it.
Hooch hears it.
- He teIIs me.
- Oh.
Hooch teIIs you about it.
WeII, uh, you Iive in
a pretty industrial area, Amos.
If you want peace and quiet, I suggest
you move to a nice apartment somewhere.
Me and Hooch in an apartment ?
Yeah, that'd be the sight.
I-I thought you didn't
mind comin' around here.
- Oh, I don't mind comin' down here.
-
It's just, uh, I'm-I'm Ieaving
on Monday, remember ?
Now, the guy who's replacing me--
Sutton--
he's not gonna want to come down
and talk to you Iike I do,
because he's, weII, he's scared
to death of your dog.
-
- I can't figure out why.
Whoa, aII right ! Hey, aII right !
That-That's good ! Huh ?
Yeah, just sit there.
Drool over yourself.
Gave 'im whisky once.
Then he howled aII night.
Now he sticks to beer.
- You want some ?
- No. No.
Thank you,
I'm not on Hooch's hours.
WeII, I-I-I really have to get goin'.
Oh.
Movin' up to the big city, huh ?
Yeah.
WeII, maybe me and Hooch
could come and visit.
You ? Anytime.
Hooch, uh--
Sacramento is the state capital.
I think they have Iaws
against dogs Iike Hooch.
Oh, stop.
It's not that funny.
Sorry, man.
I can't help it.
Every time I think about it...
I nearly wet my pants !
So do I.
That's why it's not funny.
Delta One, Delta One.
Hey, Katie. Turner can't come
to the phone right now.
- He's got a dog on this throat.
- Now, now. Just say "thank you,"
and then we're, that we're clear.
Thanks for the radio check, Katie.
We're clear.
No, it's business, Turner.
Some kids found money on Pinecone Beach.
So far they've counted 8,000.
- AII right, we'll be right there, sure.
- Katie, we're on the way, pronto.
- Mrs Harper ?
- Oh. Okay.
First I thought it was play money.
They had it scattered aII over the road.
- Wow.
- Then, when I realized it was real,
I had them show me where they found it
so I could show you.
If no one claims it or identifies it
in 30 days, it's yours.
- Oh.
- I found it. It's mine.
- She can't have any.
- Stop !
WeII, I'm confiscating it,
and if you do get it,
you have to use it for coIIege.
It's the Iaw.
- See ?
- We have some forms you're gonna
need to fiII out, Mrs Harper.
Yes. Stop that !
She wanted a formal
church wedding, and I said fine.
Suddenly, it's two grand
for a wedding dress,
reception with a fuII bar for 400,
and I'm gonna end up
pickin' up the tab for the honeymoon.
They're talkin' Bora Bora.
There he is now.
Didn't you want to talk to him ?
Yeah. Ferraday !
Want to talk to you.
Ferraday, I'm talkin' to you !
Right there !
What's the hurry ?
Hooch ! Be quiet.
-
- For Christ's sake.
You know, I feel Iike an ass.
I mean, I take you in, I give you
my trust, and what do you do ?
- You take the food off my kid's plate.
-
It was there.
I-I just Iost my head.
It won't happen again,
Mr Boyett.
Deal with it.
- Hi, there.
-  You get out of here.
- You back off !
- I hope I didn't disturb you.
You know, I realize we were making
sort of a racket over there.
In fact, I-I saw your Iight come on
over here, I realized I woke you up,
and I thought I'd better come over
and make sure everything's aII right.
WeII, you just mind your own business.
This is private property.
Okay, but you know what ?
I'm thinking if we disturbed you,
I ought to compensate you a Iittle bit,
just to make up for any inconvenience--
I don't want any of your money.
I've been watching you.
I've been seeing
what you're doing over there.
Hey, wait a minute. I can assure you,
we're doing nothing wrong over there.
- You get the heII off my dock !
- Don't !
No, don't you shove me.
You understand ?
I'm gonna introduce you to my dog.
-
- Jesus.
HeIIo. Yeah.
Yeah, I am now.
Uh, I'II-I'II be right there.
- Yo.
- ReaIIy ? Turn around.
The dog was guardin' the body.
They had to wrestle him inside.
- Ah, d-d-did you talk to anybody ?
- Nobody heard or saw anything.
Seafood workers spotted the body.
- You ever investigate a murder before ?
- Are you kiddin' ?
- I moved here
to get away from murder scenes.
- WeII, everybody's watchin',
so let's Iook Iike
we've done this before.
AII right.
I got five roIIs of film.
Burn it up.
-  Great, it's those jerks
from the Sheriff's Department.
-
Hi, guys.
-
- HeIIo there, Iadies.
We'II, uh, caII you
if we need any help, Turner.
Foster and McCabe. GIad to see you.
I need coffee, with cream.
- Do you take sugar ?
- Two sugars.
- Two sugars.
- That's cute.
Look, in the spirit of cooperation,
I'd Iove it if you guys would get
the heII out of here. Is that okay ?
The pier is our jurisdiction, guys.
Yeah, but the entire county's the
Sheriff's jurisdiction. You know that.
This is police work, not a Iost bicycle.
-
- Excuse me.
What is this, a joke ?
Come on, every Iittle speck of dirt
is not evidence.
What are you going to do, Turner ?
Put the entire pier in a Iittle baggie ?
- What is that for ?
- To preserve what's ever
underneath the fingernails.
For what ? He was stabbed
in the back, for cryin' out Ioud.
You can never anticipate
what evidence is going to be important.
- You gather it now, analyse it Iater.
- Right.
Did you read that in a book ?
Yeah. Yeah.
I did read that in a book.
It was a great big blue book,
but I think you woulda Iiked it.
It had a Iot of pictures !
-
- Hey, wait a second.
We're aII upset here.
Why don't we just cooperate ?
We aII get our jobs done.
Hey, we'd just Iike to examine the body.
Before it decomposes, you know.
-
- Aw--
Just gimme a minute with my guys,
would ya, please ?
- Not a problem.
- Thanks.
TeII ya, Scott, we're gonna have to turn
this over to the Sheriff's Department.
Why ? Why ?
They couldn't find shoes in a shoe box.
WeII, you're Ieavin' town in a few days,
David doesn't have enough experience...
- to handle a murder investigation--
-  Oh, yeah, but wait.
I don't have to be in Sacramento
for a whole other week.
I was going to take a vacation.
I'II just-- I'II just cancel it.
I'II just canc--
- We can handle this.
David's a very good Iearner.
- Turner's a heII of a teacher.
What's the point of having investigators
on your police force...
if aII we get to investigate
is stolen mailboxes ?
Come on. Howard, I got another
pay cheque coming. Let me earn it.
We can handle this.
We won't let you down.
We deserve a shot at it !
AII right, just do the best job you
can with the time you got. AII right ?
- AII right.
- AII right.
-  AII right.
What do we got ?
Okay. WeII, we're wiIIing
to share the Iab reports with you,
and we'll let you examine any evidence
that we gather. Fair enough ?
-  Oh, no. Not fair.
-  Not fair.
Sounds fair enough to me.
Oh, excuse me. Are you goin' in there
with just these things ?
We do this for a Iiving.
Stay out of the way.
Take this stuff. Make sure that
these are aII eight by ten glossies.
-  Cut it out !
-  Why ? Get goin'.
Get out of the way ! Wait !
-
-  I got him !
Turn it around. Whoa, whoa, whoa !
PuII, puII, puII !
- Get him around. Easy, easy, easy !
- Here he is ! Here he is !
Oh, my God !
Whoa !
Back him up.
Bad dog !
Good boy, good boy.
Come on, this way. Over here, boy.
Whoa ! Oh ! Oh !
- Oh ! Whoa ! SIow down, boy.
-
This-- This dog's nuts.
- We're gonna have to shoot him.
- Hey, you're not gonna shoot this dog.
He's the closest thing
we have to a witness.
Oh, yeah ? You think
you can handle him ?
You're nuts.
Where are you goin' ?
He just responds poorly to anger,
that's aII.
- Uh, David !
- What ?
David, bring the car around.
Up as close as you can. Open up the back
doors and Ieave the engine running.
Hey, there, Hooch.
Hey, you s--
You saw the whole thing, didn't ya ?
-
- Yeah, weII, Amos is gone now, so, uh--
You don't have a Iot of options.
Okay ? You are either gonna work
with me, or they're gonna shoot you.
Come on. What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna try--
I'm go-- I'm gonna try
to make you a Iittle more--
a Iittle more comfortable, huh ?
Oh, don't you just want to
think about it ?
Huh ? Huh ? Here. Here. Here.
Watch. Watch. Watch.
Uh, how do you do this ?
Let me just... make ya a Iittle...
more-- Oh, there.
There, there. Isn't that nice ?
Think about it.
Maybe we'll get some nice big
chocolate chip cookies.
Yeah. Nice big box of
chocolate chip cookies.
The soft kind ? The kind
with the 22 chips ? Want a cookie ?
The ki--
Want a cookie ?
- Come on, Hooch, get in the car !
-
- Come on, boy.
-
You people over there, get back.
- Come on !
-
- Come on !
-  Move it back.
- He's got it under control.
Stay out of the way.
- Come on, Hooch. Come on, boy.
Aw, goddam it !
-
- Hooch !
-
-  Oh, yeah, yeah !
- What, you tired ? Huh ? Hope so.
-
If you are, it's just too bad.
Now, Iook out. Look out.
Come on.
Too bad, aII right.
Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute.
Hey, you're goin' in the clinic
for a few days, pal.
It's gonna be good for ya.
Come on.
- Come on ! Come on. Come on.
-
- Come on, Hooch. Come-- Come on.
-
- Come-- Wait a-- Whoa ! Hooch !
-
Hooch, no ! Stop !
Stop ! Hooch !
-
- Hooch ! Stop ! No !
-
-
I'II kiII ya.
No, Hooch !
-
- Hey, what are you doing to this dog ?
- Ow. Ohh !
Just taking him for a walk.
- WeII, he's bleeding.
- My God, how Iong has he been bleeding?
- Not Iong enough.
- You ! I'II kiII ya.
- Hey. Now, I have a front door,
you know.
- I'II shoot you, Hooch.
I'II shoot you, Hooch.
- WeII, you stay there.
- You just stay right there.
- Fix him up so I can shoot him.
-
- AII right. AII done. You stay.
- What's your dog's name ?
-
Uh, uh, his name is Hooch, but--
Those wounds needed stitching.
- When was the Iast time he saw a vet ?
- I don't know.
WeII, that's neglect. And it's
borderline abuse. I mean, he's filthy.
His diet is terrible,
and Iook, if you cannot--
WeII, no, hey, no,
this is not my dog.
He belonged to an old man
who Iived down by the pier.
- WeII, then, I want to speak to him.
- You can't.
- He was murdered Iast night.
- Whoa. God.
I'm Scott Turner, I'm the, um,
police investigator here in town--
I know. I mean, we use the same bank.
Emily Carson.
- Oh, we do ? Oh. WeII. Oh.
- Yes. Yes.
- I'm sorta new here,
but it's a smaII town, so--
- It's ni-nice to meet you.
- I'm sorry about this misunderstanding.
- That's quite aII right.
I can't stand seeing animals mistreated.
- Can I ask you a question
regarding the dog ?
- Yes. Come in.
There's a good chance, I think,
that he was a witness to the, uh, crime.
He may have to identify a suspect.
Can he do that ?
- Yes. Maybe.
- Can I show him, Iike, a photograph ?
Like a, Iike a mug shot ? And--
- You don't know much
about dogs, do you ?
- WeII, no, I n-never had one.
- Not even as a kid ?
-  N-No. No way.
WeII, dogs don't see
in two dimensions.
I mean, he could recognize a voice,
or a scent, but not a photo.
- AII right. AII right.
- Come on, Hooch. Come on !
Uh, doesn't he have to... recoup ?
WeII, no.
He's a Iittle tired, but he's okay.
You're a good "dawg."
Yes.
- Boy, you sure are good with animals.
- Yeah. I'm a vet.
You're buttering me up for something.
WeII, I-I just can't help but think that
this dog is gonna be a Iot better off...
with someone Iike you,
than with someone Iike me.
- 'Cause I-I don't know-- Thank you.
- Are you married ?
-
- No.
- You Iive alone, then ?
- Yeah.
- House, or an apartment ?
- House.
Yeah ?
You have a girlfriend ?
- No.
- WeII, perfect.
- Perfect ? Perfect for who ?
- Perfect for Hooch.
- For Hoo-- How ?
- When you're home,
he'II keep you company,
and when you're gone,
he'II take care of your house.
-You're Iucky to have him.
-Oh, no, no, no, no.
I don't have room for a dog Iike Hooch.
Not many people do. I gotta go work.
Goodbye, Scott Turner.
What ?
What ? What is it ?
What ? What ?
Are ya-- If you're hungry, finish
the hamburgers. Ya-- Eat the buns.
-
- Eat the buns. If you're not thirsty--
You know, you're not touching the water,
the orange juice, cranapple.
What is it ?
What am I supposed to do ?
- Make you a margarita ?
-
Shut up ! God !
Shut up ! This has been going on
for two and a haIf hours.
-
- Just be quiet !
-
-
-
-
A-AII right. AII right. AII right.
You teII me what I'm supposed to do.
You teII me what I am supposed to do.
What am I supposed to do ?
You teII me.
What am I supposed to do ?
What am I supposed to do, Hooch ?
Am I supposed to stand out
on the porch aII night Iong ?
-
-  Give him a Valium, Turner.
Take one yourself.
Hey, shut up !
I'm a policeman.
Gu-- Want your car towed ?
Man, I hate you.
Oh, no !
Aah ! You !
Aw, ya stupid dog !
No.
Ah, ya stupid dog !
Oh, you wanna chew my head off ?
Go ahead. You'II be trapped inside
and you'II starve to death.
That is, if they don't find
my body first and then shoot you.
You're in my house.
Back off. I'm comin' in.
-
- Back off, Hooch !
Back off.
Back.
AII right.
If we're gonna get along, we're gonna
have to come to a certain understanding.
-
-These are the simple rules: No barking.
No growling. You wiII not Iift your Ieg
to anything in this house.
This is not your room.
No slobbering.
No chewing.
You wiII wear a flea coIIar.
This is not your room.
-
- No begging for food.
No sniffing of crotches.
And you wiII not
drink from my toilet.
This is not your room.
This is your room.
The rest of the house is mine,
and when I come back into my house,
I Iike to find everything
where I put it.
Everything in its place.
Now, you don't touch my stuff.
And I certainly
won't touch any of yours.
WeII, this is the room to do that.
This is your bed.
You foIIow these very simple rules...
and shut up,
we'll get along fine.
Hey, Scott.
-
- So what does it teII you ?
Not much. I never read
an autopsy report before,
and I'd just as soon
never read one again.
Autopsy report's the cornerstone
of any homicide investigation.
This one teIIs us that the perpetrator
probably had special combat training.
- Where did you see that ?
- Right here. "The murder weapon
penetrated the body...
"between the third and fourth ribs,
at an upward angle...
"entering the right Iung
at a depth of two inches,
severing the pulmonary artery.,,
I read that.
The victim was stabbed from behind
on the right side of the rib cage,
which would make
the kiIIer right-handed.
Yeah, yeah.
But you're missing something.
Now, you stab somebody in the heart,
they can stiII scream.
But you penetrate the Iung,
they can't even let out a whisper.
They're trained to do that
in Special Forces.
WeII, that wasn't in the report.
How did you know that ?
I'm a professional investigator.
It's my business to know these things.
Besides,
I caIIed the coroner and he told me.
Hey, feIIas.
How much do you think we could get
for aII of the furniture
here in the office ?
Or I got a better idea, how about
we seII a couple of squad cars,
startin' with yours first, Turner ?
- Is there a problem, Howard ?
- WeII, yeah. There sure is.
I mean, the county crime Iab wanted
to charge me 7,280 for this stuff.
Now, suppose I send aII of this in,
who do you suggest I Iay off ?
Hmm ?
Katie. Katie wouldn't mind
making the sacrifice, would you, Katie ?
- I've sacrificed enough for you, Tur--
- Oh, hey !
- We'II thin this out, Howard.
I'II go through it.
- PIease.
Don't worry. I'II thin it out.
Howard. It's fine.
Oh, no, no, no !
You're eatin' the car !
Don't eat the car !
Not the car !
Oh, what am I yeIIin' at you for ?
You're a dog.
- Don't understand a word I'm sayin'.
-
What does it matter anyway ?
This car is gonna be David Sutton's
in a couple of days.
Here. You hungry ? Here.
Here's an ashtray. Eat that.
You know,
it's a terrible thing about Amos.
I'm Iockin' my door tonight,
for the first time in years.
Oh, now, don't-don't do that.
We'II-We'II catch the guy.
I-I-Is this dog food ?
It says turkey and bacon.
Oh yeah. You know, people Iove
their dogs, so they want a variety.
- What kinda dog are we talkin' about ?
- Oh, very, very, very big.
Very Iarge, very taII.
Very, very wide. Massive. Ugly.
Ah-ha. WeII.
You don't need this.
What you need is...
- this !
-
I don't even Iike the dog, Kevin.
Why would I get him a toy ?
Because dogs Iike to chew, Scott.
I mean, it's either chew this,
or your furniture or your shoes.
- It's up to you.
- Okay.
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday !
At the Imperial Raceway in San RapeIIo.
The world-class semifinals of
the N.R.D.A. funny car competition !
- Sunday, Sunday, Sunday !
-
I'd Iike to thank you, Kevin,
for taking aII this time away--
Oh, no, no problem.
It's my pleasure.
- Dog shampoo.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
That's regular, no.
What you need is-- Yeah, medicated.
There, that's what you need.
Let's see.
FIea, tick, uh, wormer--
Scott ! Oh, Scott ! In case of
bad breath, regular, or minty ?
Thank you, Kevin.
- Ninety-seven fifty-one.
- Ninety-seven fifty-one ?
What ? Is that--
Is that pesos ?
This is for a dog. This is dog food.
Ninety-seven fifty-one ?
I'm not gonna eat this stuff !
Uh, did I buy smoked salmon ?
Ninety-seven fifty-one !
- How much if I take this back ?
-
I'd Iike to talk to Kevin.
Can you caII him, please ? Kevin !
You get off of there.
Off !
-
-
AII right, that's it.
I'm gettin' my gun.
My rod, my piece,
my iron, my heater,
my gat, my Iead-hurler !
Do not come back !
Oh, wow. Wow.
That dog's got a Iot of guts.
Either that, or he's stupid.
No !
You are out ! Out.
-
- Out for good.
Forget it, I wish it was snowing.
-
- No, no. I wish it was hailing.
I wish it was hailing, God.
- Send me hail the size of cantaloupes,
-
if you're a just and fair God.
-
- No !
-
- Cut it--
No, the--
I'm runnin' out of doors.
Oh, no. No.
She cannot spend the night.
Get back. Get back.
You, you go ahead. Not you.
No, no, no. Come on.
Not you, just her.
Get back in the car.
Wait a minute, what am I doin' ?
What am I doin' ?
Go ahead, Hooch.
Go ahead. Go. Go !
Go.
Go. Go ahead. Go, boy, go.
FoIIow her. FoIIow her, boy.
She wants ya, man !
This is why she's doin' this,
so you'II foIIow her. In. In. In.
Go in, go in, go in.
Hi.
- Scott Turner, right ?
- Yeah, I was Iookin' for my dog.
Have you seen him ?
Yeah, I noticed.
You know anything about fuses ?
- EIectrical fuses ?
- Uh, yeah. Can you come in ?
For two minutes ?
Just two minutes.
- A fuse box ? Sure.
- Come in.
- Bedroom Iight is on !
- Huh ? What ?
- What ?
- Bedroom Iight is on !
So teII me when
the bathroom Iight goes on.
Mm, aII right !
Hey !
- Hey !
- Uh, no, not yet.
Uh, Iook, thank you, but, uh--
The-The-- Your Iights are on. This is
going to take you aII night, you know.
No, actuaIIy, I just quit.
- You were gonna Ieave it Iike this ?
- Yes.
- Oh.
- I'm gonna start again tomorrow, but--
WeII, you, ah, don't have
to help, but there's...
a couple of roIIers there,
and an extra brush.
- This really bothers you.
- This would make me nuts, yeah.
It's harder to cut it in a big town
than it is in a smaII town.
Aw, that's a crock.
- Oh ?
- In a big town, you're anonymous.
You make your mistakes,
no one sees it.
Who cares ? In a smaII town, you got
to Iook everybody right in the eye.
Oh. WeII, there's a--
There's a Iot more to it than that.
WeII, that's true. You'II probably
have better Iuck with women.
Women in big cities outnumber the men,
so they're more desperate.
-
- Thank you very much.
-
- If you have opinions about anything,
I want to encourage
you to express them.
Don't be shy. Just blurt them right out.
WeII, you're better off here.
-Oh, yeah ?
-It's a wonderful town to raise kids in.
- WeII, I don't have kids.
- WeII, I want five kids.
How about a dad ? Huh ? Have you got
a dad picked out for these five kids ?
- No. Not yet.
- No ?
- WeII, let me fiII you in
on the Cypress Beach singles scene.
- God, I hate that phrase--
- "The Singles Scene."
- There's Embers Cocktail Lounge.
Or, what else ?
I guess the, uh, weII, the Dairy Queen.
But I usuaIIy arrest guys my age
who are hanging out at the Dairy Queen.
'Course, you're pretty opinionated, and
you want to have those five kids, so--
- That I am.
- And we are...
- Uh, yeah.
- finished.
- This is good.
- Yeah.
- Doesn't it feel good ?
- This feels very good.
- Huh ?
- I got to admit it.
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
You have paint aII over you.
It's even up in your hair.
Look at you.
You don't even have it on your hands.
-  Yeah. Yeah.
- Spotless.
I have some, uh,
- some packing that I stiII have to do.
- Right.
- WeII, it's a nice night.
- Yeah.
And I have to walk CamiIIe.
Do you want to take a walk with me ?
- Uh, no. No.
- No ?
No, no, no. WeII, you see,
I'm, I'm starting to Iike you.
And if we go on a walk,
I'm just going to Iike you even more.
And then, one day,
we might even end up in Iove,
and everything wiII go along fine,
for a while, but,
but then, one day, bang, you're gonna
caII me a selfish, compulsive bastard.
And you're going to puII your hair out,
and you're gonna scream,
and you're gonna say
you never want to see me again,
because I drive you crazy.
And I'm Ieft shattered.
Now who needs that ? Good night.
Hooch !
What time do you want to tackle
that haIIway tomorrow night ?
'Bout 7:00 ?
Good night, Houdini.
Okay, boy. Guess what ?
It's time for a bath.
Come on.
-
- Come on. Come on.
Time for a bath.
Let's go.
Oh, baby. Up.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
-
-
Ugh !
-
-
- Ah, ah !
-
No, no, no, no. Okay.
Get in the tub. Get in the tub.
-
-
No !
This is why man wiII prevail, and
your kind wiII never dominate the earth.
This is what you can do
if you've got thumbs !
Huh ? Move around.
Move around. I don't care.
There you go.
Oh, what a ferocious dog !
- Get your armpits here.
Get your undercarriage.
-
If I Ieave you in the car,
you're just gonna eat the rest of it.
Come on.
-
-  Oh !
Turner, what the heII is that ?
- Come here.
- You can't bring a dog in here.
Uh, can you,
uh, Iift up this desk ?
-
-
Something different about you.
I Iike to think so, yeah.
Oh, I know what it is.
No tie.
This is the first time
since I've known you that
you haven't worn a tie on the job.
- Turner ?
- Yeah ?
- The dog's in the window siII.
- Oh. Hooch, get down from there.
-
- Hooch.
WeII, what can I do, Katie ?
The dog Ioves weddings.
- Hooch, knock it off.
-
-
- Hooch, shut up.
Shut up, Hooch.
Come on, shut up !
-
- You ought to get the heII out of here.
Be careful !
- Ooh !
-
What is it ?
What's the matter ?
Dave ! Police officer !
How ya doin', Petey ?
Dave !
Right behind you.
-
- Hooch !
Folks, don't panic !
Don't panic !
-
-
- Hooch ! Stop !
-
Hey, feIIas,
what the heII are you doing ?
- Hooch !
-
-
- Hooch !
-
-
- Damn !
-  Ever see that guy before ?
No ! I can't see his plates.
I don't have my glasses.
-
- Hold it ! Police officers.
We need your car.
Hi, Ernie. Come on,
Buckle your seat belt.
- Buckle my seat belt ?
- Buckle the seat belt !
I can't find my seat belt !
-
-  We gotta stop and get Hooch!
Come on, boy! Come on, Hooch.
Get in the car. Get in the car.
In here. Good boy. Good boy.
Come on, Hooch. Watch his tail.
My mom is gonna kiII me.
She told me not to take this
thing over 40. It's brand-new.
- She's gonna kiII me. I'm dead.
- Calm down, Ernie.
Gotta do this to break it in.
- Your mom wiII thank you for it.
- Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
- He's stepping on my mom's groceries !
- SIap him across the face. He'II stop.
Ugh ! Ugh !
-  AII right. What is that ?
-  It's a black CadiIIac.
What is the Iicence plate ?
I can see the car.
Uh, wait. P-K-I. P-K-I.
- Okay, P-K-I--
- No. "B."
- No. It's P-K-I.
- It's a "B."
- B-K-I.
- Shut up !
- Shut up, Ernie !
- P-K-I.
- P-K-I.
- R-K-I-5-4-7.
- R-K-I-5-4-7.
- AII right, that's right. R-K-I-5-4-7.
- Romeo, Kilo, India, 5-4-7.
AII right, hang on, hang on.
He saw us ! He saw us ! Come on !
Come on, come on, come on.
- Which way ? Which way ?
- I think he went right.
- Right, right ! I'm sure it's right.
- WeII, don't guess !
It's right, okay ?
Go right ! Right !
Highway Patrol hears about that,
I'm out of a job before I even start !
Hey, Turner, don't worry about it.
It'II be our Iittle secret.
What's the matter with your mom ?
She can't get a car with some muscle ?
WeII ! You boys really
Iivened up the reception.
The bride burst into tears
and swore...
she was gonna have nightmares the rest
of her Iife because of that dog.
Fortunately Boyett thought you
were trying to capture the beast.
The mayor did too. I, of course, did not
teII them it was your runaway pet...
that had now become
the station mascot.
Don't raise your voice
around him Iike that.
- You'II just set him off again.
- Aw, come on.
- He's chained to a radiator.
- That doesn't matter.
Zack Gregory is a former Marine
with three arrests on his record:
Assault with a deadly weapon,
transportation of unregistered
firearms, and extortion.
No convictions. Monterey P.D. says that
address and phone number were false.
- WeII, who is he ?
- The guy Hooch was just chasing--
- The man he saw kiII Amos Reed.
-
- You're kidding. Think this is the guy?
- Yeah.
- What ?
- Gee.
-
-
- Congratulations. You broke the case.
- WeII, we don't have him yet.
Yeah.
There's, uh, no motive, Howard.
Amos wasn't kiIIed in a robbery
or a pattern crime, or in a fight.
-
- We think maybe he was kiIIed
to cover something up.
-
- This, uh--
This Zack guy is employed
by Boyett Seafood.
Now, Amos was always complaining about
strange noises down there at night.
- Like something iIIegal was going on.
- Hmm. Katie, could you...
swing the door open, please ?
We're gonna need some air in here.
Amos complained
about everything, Turner.
Yeah, and now he's dead, Howard.
I think we need to assume
that he was right.
Now consider it.
It's an isolated spot down there.
There's fishing boats coming in
and going out aII the time.
Now somebody's kiIIed ?
Drugs, Howard.
I know we don't have the personnel,
and we'll never have a warrant
with the stuff that we have so far,
but it sure would be nice
if we could search that place.
Yeah, aII right.
I guess I can handle that.
I mean, Boyett's a friend of mine.
What's he gonna say, no ?
Yeah. D.E.A. agents,
Customs guys, the C.H.P.,
two shifts of our own guys,
plus aII sorts of Iocal cops.
This is gonna be the biggest search
in the central coast since--
What ? Since probably World War II,
and it's aII because of you.
We're gonna go through Boyett's
Iike bacon through a duck...
and bust us a smuggling operation.
This is dessert.
Chocolate chip cookies.
Chocolate chip.
Something to drink ?
It's not gonna hurt me at aII
if we impress some of those C.H.P. guys.
That's gonna Iook good on the resumé.
Give me maybe a Iittle job security
in the future.
Nothin' wrong with that.
There you go.
WeII, come on.
You're not eating. Go ahead.
Go ahead.
This is a celebration, Hooch.
You I.D.'d Zack Gregory.
Amos's murder is aII but solved.
So go.
- Open your beer.
-
What ?
You're thinking about Amos ?
Huh ?
You must miss him.
Yeah, weII,
I forget sometimes that
this must be pretty hard on you.
Everything's so different.
You and I got off
to a pretty bad start,
and my place isn't exactly
a rusty shack fiIIed with junk.
Not yet, anyway.
You can keep working on it.
Okay ?
Hmm ?
- You Iike that ?
-
You Iike that ?
You do !
You Iike that.
WeII, here.
Let me do this side as weII.
Huh ? Huh ?
You're not so rough.
- You're not so mean.
-
You're not any kind
of a monster dog, are ya ?
Ooh ! Ooh ! Ooh !
Look at that face. Look at those
big teeth. What are you doing ?
Give me back my towel.
Give it to me.
- AII right then ! Come on !
-
-
- Come on ! Come get this thing !
Get it ! Ha ! Ha-ha !
I got it !
Oh, yeah ! Yeah !
I'm coming right now for you !
WeII, if any of my employees
are involved in anything iIIegal,
I'm happy to cooperate.
- I just don't understand it.
- When was the Iast time
you saw Zack Gregory ?
Yesterday at the wedding.
He didn't show up for work Iast night.
WeII, the Monterey police
checked out his address.
It was a motel,
and they'd never heard of him.
He shows up for his pay cheque,
I'II caII you.
AII right, let's go, guys !
Come on !
I don't want any Sheriff's Department
guys handling this stuff alone.
Let's make sure one of our guys
is with them aII the way.
- Gee, I hate fish.
-
Okay.
Let's check in the back.
Move these filing cabinets out,
- then go through these one by one.
-
Maybe we came on the wrong day.
Howard, I apologize.
I'm sorry.
- I really let you down.
- Come on.
Forget it. Can't expect things
to pan out every time, can you ?
Besides, you got a new job
waiting for you.
Why don't you go home
and pack up and get ready.
David, the case is now yours.
Foster, the guys in Monterey told me...
you sheriffs did
the original go-see on Zack Gregory,
but the D.M.V. says they sent
his vehicle registration...
on the black CadiIIac
to the Lazy Acres motel.
So I'm just trying to determine how you
discovered that it was a false address.
What did you do,
just caII them up on the phone ?
You didn't even go down
for an interview ?
You didn't show them a photo ?
WeII, aII right, Iook,
I need surveiIIance done...
on the Lazy Acres motel
to Iocate Zack Gregory.
Yes. He's the prime suspect
in the Amos Reed murder, that's why.
Yes, he is.
He is Iegitimate.
I have an eyewitness, kind of.
I am not teIIing you
how to do your job.
I am a Iaw enforcement officer,
and you are too, kind of,
and I'm asking you
for a professional courtesy.
Don't hang up on me !
What a dumb cop.
Scott Turner.
Oh, hi. Yeah.
Hey, how's the town vet ?
It just keeps
clicking around inside my brain,
what Amos told me about that place,
that there's something going on.
I don't know.
I can't figure it out,
- and I can't stop thinking about it.
- Maybe you should.
-  No.
- Stop thinking about it.
WeII, when I have a problem
that I can't get anywhere with,
sometimes I just think of
something completely different,
and then that's when
a solution comes, bang,
just Iike that, out of nowhere.
- WeII, that's fascinating.
-
I don't work that way, aII right ?
- WeII, try.
- WeII, I-- No, I can't.
- I don't, uh-- I don't know how.
- WeII, I'II help.
- I'm thinking about something else.
-
- What am I thinking about ?
- Oh, don't.
- Indulge me.
- Don't, don't-- Don't even, uh--
- I don't know
what you're thinking about.
- Oh, great.
So you've never thought about it ?
Never thought about what ?
Oh, oh, oh-- Thought about--
- Oh ! WeII--
- Thought about that. WeII--
Yes. I'm a guy. Yes. Yeah.
I've thought about that.
- How far did you get ?
- WeII, I, uh, I got to unbutton the...
top button of your blouse.
I got a Iot farther than that.
- You did ?
- Mm-hmm.
- How far ? A Iot farther ?
- WeII, a Iot farther.
I didn't know
there was farther than that.
WeII, you have to use
your imagination.
- WeII, that's got to be iIIegal.
- Probably is.
- Eww ! Right from the carton ?
- Mm.
Oh, God ! A woman in my house.
How'd that happen ?
Hey, how's your back ?
WeII, it's regained some
of its elasticity, I'd say.
Yeah.
- WeII, this thing is empty.
- Mm-hmm.
What are we gonna do about it ?
WeII, most of my grocery budget's
been blown on my dog,
- but we could manage--
- Those eggs ?
- Perfect omelette.
- Oh, that's great. Go to it.
Uh, weII, um--
- No. No, no, no. No, no, no.
-
No, I think "we" was
the operative word there.
- No. Oh, geez !
- Oh, weII !
Oh !
You Iook very Iovely in the Iight.
- I don't do this.
- That's where it aII happens.
- We have cheese.
- Oh, come on.
- I'II mess up your kitchen.
- I'm not gonna cook for you, woman...
- 'cause you wore me out.
- Did I ?
We could caII for pizza.
Don't. Don't.
I'II walk you through this, Doctor.
That's an omelette pan
right above you.
Aw, geez. You have a pan
just for your omelettes ?
There's a whisk and--
-
- Oh, no.
- I'm hungry too.
- Oh, come on. I'm doing it.
I'd Iike to eat some time
in the next five hours.
- Is this happening ?
- There you go, and great.
Now, mix that up...
and then we'll throw in
the other stuff.
-
- No, that's-that's stirring.
This is how you mix.
This is how you mix.
Oh, my God.
Do that again, would you ?
- You Iike that ?
-  Oh ! Yeah.
Oh, you feel so--
feel so good.
You smeII so good.
Oh !
- Mmm ! Oh, Jesus, of course !
- What ?
Oh ! They're not
bringing something in !
How could I-- Oh !
- The thing that I wasn't thinking of !
- Oh, the thought.
- Yes ! Bang !
- Oh. I told you--
Hits me right--
That's never happened to me.
I gotta get another Iook
inside that place.
- They're smuggling something out !
- Why did I open my mouth ?
So does this mean
I'II be eating alone ?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, but yeah.
I teII you what.
I'II make it up to you tomorrow night.
Have you ever been down to that
Italian place down in San RapeIIo ?
They make a Iasagna down there.
It's not a great Iasagna,
but it is a good Iasagna.
I make better, but do you want--
You want to go tomorrow night ?
So, you're gonna be here
another night ?
- Oh, yes.
- WeII--
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yes.
Yeah, another night...
at Ieast.
Hooch ! Come on, boy.
- He's outside.
- What is he doing outside ?
- With CamiIIe.
- Oh, would you clean this stuff up ?
When you're done ?
AII right ?
Just-- Leave it. Never mind.
It's aII right. It's aII right.
I've got it.
- Oh, God ! What time ?
- 7:00.
- I'II meet you here.
- I'II meet you here ! Hooch, come on !
-
- Hooch, put that down !
Come on !
This your first stake-out ?
It's mine.
Mmm.
WeII, it's gonna be a Iong night,
so what do you say
we prepare for it, huh ?
Try to stay alert.
ShaII we ? Want one ?
There you go. Special treat, aII right ?
Mmm ! Whoa. That's good.
They're hard.
WeII,
it's not bad.
Tastes Iike health food.
You can have this.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
Back in there.
Now, back to work.
It was caIIed
Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp.
It was Iike, you know, Iike
The Man from U.N.C.L.E. or something.
Did Amos have a TV ? Oh. It was
two-dimensional. You couldn't see it.
It was these chimps,
and they were supposed to be spies,
and they were dressed up in suits
and stuff, and they'd wear hats,
and smoke cigarettes
and talk Iike that.
You missed it. It was good.
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.
was good though too.
That was a good show. It was a
cool show. It was on Mondays at 9:00.
But it wasn't
Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp.
What does that do for you, huh ?
That feel good ?
Wake you up a Iittle bit, hmm ?
I guess you have to be a dog.
Mmm.
Maybe I should have.
I had-- I had the enlistment papers
aII fiIIed out.
and aII that kind of stuff was sent,
but I had this thing
with distance vision...
so no flight school for me.
If you're in the Air Force
and you're not in flight school,
it means you're scraping bird shit off
of some runway in Guam for two years.
So... here I am.
I'm boring you.
It's my apple.
I got you something.
Here.
I got you a diet Coke.
Diet 'cause-- Look at that.
Gotta start working on that.
You know, we've-- we've known
each other for a while now.
Uh, I think it's safe for me to say.
Are you aware of your drooling problem ?
I mean, it Iooks Iike
you swaIIowed a tennis shoe...
and you've got the Iaces
hanging out.
It's, you know,
it's a bit embarrassing.
Don't you think ?
Maybe you could save that.
Is there a use for this stuff,
Iike as an industrial Iubricant
or something ?
Eww. Good God.
I won't even say
what you're doing to the car.
- Hey.
- Did you bring it ?
Yeah, I brought it.
- You do know that
we have to take it back ?
- Yeah. Yeah, we'll take it back.
We'II take it back.
Come on, Hooch.
Come on. There you go.
Listen, I saw Boyett Ieave, so let's
get this over with before he comes back.
Wait a minute.
What about getting permission ?
- Oh, David, why don't you relax ?
- Relax ?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
There's something not right here.
You got that Iook in your eye.
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Oh, yes you do.
-  You humped the vet.
- Oh, "humped the vet."
Humped the--
You have a Iot of class.
I happened to have
a religious experience...
with the future Mrs Scott Turner
who happens to--
Yes. She holds a doctorate
in veterinary medicine.
Get that ugly mutt out of here.
Sorry.
We're police officers.
This is a police dog, and we
just want to have a Iook around.
- You were here yesterday.
- The dog wasn't available yesterday.
This dog is a big problem.
He's a major health code violation.
WeII, I-I don't understand
what the hassle is.
I spoke with Mr Boyett.
He said he'd be happy to cooperate.
WeII, if he said it's okay,
then I guess it's okay.
- Thank you.
- Liar.
- What ?
- Boyett didn't teII you that.
He sure did... yesterday.
Come here, boy.
Okay, Hooch.
Let's find some money, huh ?
Can you ?
Can you find some money ?
Huh ? Huh ?
SmeII it. SmeII that money.
Find me some, okay ?
Yeah, find some for me too, Hooch.
- Go find it, Hooch.
- What makes you think
these things are connected ?
You know why I took that job
in Sacramento ?
Yes. Because nothing
ever happens in Cypress Beach.
But what has that got
to do with anything ?
There's been two unusual incidents
in town aII year-- Amos's murder...
and 8,000 found on the beach-- they
happened a day apart from each other.
Now, maybe there's a connection.
- Maybe there's not.
-
What is it, Hooch ?
What, you got something, boy ?
What is it ?
What you got ? What'd you get ?
What is this ?
What you got, huh ?
Look at this.
This is a perfect match.
It's the same size.
It's the same brand, everything.
That's a good boy.
Oh, yeah.
- Way to go ! Good going.
- AII right, you guys.
I just talked to Mr Boyett.
He never gave you permission
to bring a dog in here. He's furious.
And I hope he sues
the crap out of you.
Hey, weII, we're done anyway.
Thanks very much.
Come on, boy. Come on, Hooch.
Here we go. Come on.
You know, I could get fired over this.
It's fine for you.
You have another job to go to.
- I Iike a town where nothing happens.
- Don't worry. I'II take the blame.
I'II talk to Boyett and work it out.
Then I'II caII Howard and do the same.
AII right, what should I do ?
WeII, we need to find out
how common these plastic bags are--
if you can just pick 'em up
in a supermarket,
or if they're a special
order kind of thing--
so check out aII the businesses,
stores, things Iike that.
Then park the car,
turn off the radio, take a nap.
'Cause if you're in on what
I'm doing next, you wiII get fired.
- You stay in the car.
-
...think so, Skipper.
- Skipper ! Mary Ann and Ginger !
-  What about them ?
-We gotta warn them about the Professor!
-
No vacancy.
-
- Speak English, moron. No vacancy.
If you ain't got a warrant, get Iost.
- You know him ?
- Never seen him.
I don't have a Iot of experience being
one of these intimidating policemen.
- I've never had to threaten anybody.
- You're breakin' my heart.
So, in order for you
to take me seriously,
- I guess I'm just gonna have
to shoot you in the Ieg.
- Yeah, sure you are.
You almost shot me !
I can't believe you done that !
-
- I can't believe I missed.
Now, where is Zack Gregory ?
-
- Put the gun on the counter.
- Zack Gregory ?
- I believe so.
Go over to the CadiIIac.
- You drive.
-
Hey, a seat belt ? Oh, yeah.
Think that's gonna keep you safe ?
Start the car.
What are you doing ?
AII right, now start the car.
Now go out here and turn Ieft.
-
- What are you doin' ? SIow down.
Careful ! Look out !
You're not gonna do it.
You don't have what it takes.
What, kiII you ? You're right.
I don't. But he does. Hooch !
-
-
It's an interesting sensation,
isn't it ?
I'm just gonna ask you some questions,
and you blink once for yes,
and twice for no, okay ?
Once. Yes. Okay, good.
You kiIIed Amos Reed.
I don't believe you.
Hooch says you did.
-
-
"Yes." Okay. Progress. Good.
Now, the seafood plant--
you're using that as a cover ?
You're smuggling money-- cash--
out of the country ? Yes.
Okay. Hmm.
This is fun, isn't it ?
Boyett's in charge ? No ?
-
-
I can't stop him from snapping
your neck in two. Is Boyett in charge ?
Is Boyett in on it ?
AII right.
-
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
Here. Back this way.
AII right, I'm just gonna make you
a Iittle more comfortable, that's aII.
-
- AII right. Good. Now, let's sit down.
Let's sit down. Hooch !
- Come on, boy.
-
Keep an eye on him for me,
would ya ?
What is this in your pocket ?
Oh. Thanks.
Okay, now, Hooch. Is there any way
I can get you to understand this ?
I need you to cover the back.
Understand ? Cover the back.
You know, the back,
the back-- the backyard.
The back door. The gate.
The back-- The back
of the building, okay ?
PIease ?
Cover the back.
What a good dog.
- Oh ! You scared me.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Are you aII right ?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
- It's-It's nothing.
- I got here as fast as I could.
I mean, I can't believe it's Boyett.
- You were right.
- Where's the backup ?
- Where is everybody ?
- Huh ? Oh, yeah.
I got four cars out on Carpenter Road.
They're ready any time I signal them.
- Okay.
- Uh, so--
- You ready ?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Looks Iike we missed 'em.
Yeah.
Hey, the engine of this forklift
is stiII warm.
So it Iooks Iike we just missed 'em.
- Hey ! Hey !
- Because you tipped 'em off,
didn't you, Howard ?
What are you doing ?
What's going on here ?
You got backup on Carpenter Road,
you better caII 'em in. Use the radio.
- Turner, come on. It's-It's Howard.
- Look, Iook, Iook.
You and Boyett are Iaundering money.
You've got the perfect set-up here.
This smaII town where nothing ever
happens. Built-in police protection.
I even know how you're doing it.
No !
That's aII the evidence I need, Howard.
It's just a matter of
who's gonna seII you out first,
Zack or Boyett.
We got him pinned between us !
-  He's on your right !
- Cover me !
-
- No !
You hit my Ieg.
AII right, Iace your hands
behind your head.
- Don't turn around.
- Howard.
He's stiII got his pistol.
- Howard, what are you doing ?
-
Scott ?
I'II kiII you if I have to.
But obviously this is going to be
a Iot easier to explain...
if we both have the same story.
What ?
We came here to question him
and he fired at us.
He kiIIed your dog. We fired back.
KiIIed the suspect.
Congratulations.
You solved the case.
You know, I met some people
when I was in the army in Panama,
and they needed a secure way
to get cash out of the country,
so Walt set it up,
and I got one percent.
- It's drug money, Howard.
- I don't know that.
I never asked where it came from.
It's a damn shame that people
are getting kiIIed over this thing.
When I found out about it
it was too Iate. Do you believe me ?
- How do you explain Amos's murder ?
-  It's covered.
Zack kiIIed Amos.
Boyett told him to do it.
Boyett's dead. The case is closed.
It's aII true.
Now, you gonna work
with me on this ?
Sure is a Iot of money, Howard.
Yeah, I'II work with you.
TeII the truth.

-
- Hooch.
Hooch, Hooch, Hooch.
Come here. Keep these on.
Come on.
Hold that there.
Use pressure to stop the blood.
You'II be aII right
once we get you home.
Once we get you home,
you'II be aII right.
- What you need is some rest.
- Keep your hands on his face.
He can smeII you.
- That's right.
- Yeah.
You'II be aII right.
Change it when it gets soaked.
That's right.
Just hold on, pal.
You okay ?
He's gonna be aII right.
He'II be okay.
He's Iost a Iot of blood.
It's okay.
It's aII right.
Good boy. That's a good boy.

They may not drive weII, but we try
to keep them a Iittle bit clean here.
Hey, I'm sorry, man.
- Let's go. Come on.

Seat belt. Seat belt.
Oh, ho !
Stolen bicycles from the high school.
Congratulations.
How'd you know to Iook here ?
Hey. I'm a professional investigator.
It's my job to know these things.
You got a tip.
I got a tip.
You solved the case.
It feels good, doesn't it ?
Chief,
your wife just caIIed the station.
Quote, unquote:
"He's out, and if you're not home
in five minutes, you're hamburger."
- Hey, Turner, you need my help ?
- I can handle my own domestic crisis.
- Wait a minute. Here. Take my jacket.
- What ?
Wrap it around your throat.
- Good Iuck, Chief.
- Good Iuck is Scott's.
-
- What's going on ? I'm home.
Help ! I didn't get my nap.
I didn't-- I didn't get
my ice cream cone.
And he set them off again.
These are perfectly nice puppies
and then he gets them going.
- Uh, where-- where is he ?
- I'm done.
Where is he ? Where is he ?
- He's upstairs. He's yours.
- I'II take care of it.
- I'II take care of it. AII right.
- You deal with it.
- Professional veterinarian.

No eating of the house plants.
No dogs aIIowed
on the second floor at aII.
No playing of my records.
No sniffing of crotches.
No drinking out of the toilet.
You wiII not beg for food.
No baII playing in the house.
No chewing or slobbering of my shoes.
- You wiII not hide from me.
-
This is not your room.
