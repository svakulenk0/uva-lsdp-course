- You have a loan app? Wonderful.
- Yeah. Terrific.
My wife and I were having dinner
the other night... recently married.
- How can I help you, sir?
- Loretta,
see the man talking
to your bank manager has his case open?
Oh, that's Mr. Gwendon,
one of our assistant managers.
Our manager is Mr. Schoen,
but he's not in today.
- But you see the man with the briefcase.
- Yes.
That's my partner.
He has a gun in there.
If you don't do exactly
what I tell you or if you give me
any kind of problem at all,
I'm going to look at my partner
and he's going to shoot your
Mr. Gwendon between the eyes.
Okay.
All right, take one of those big
envelopes and put as many 100s,
Nothing with bank straps
or rubber bands. I don't want
dye packs. I don't want bait money.
Start with the second drawer,
and then the one over there,
under the money counter.
Okay. It's okay. Come on, Loretta.
Key's right next to you.
There you go.
No bills off the bottom
of the drawer, please.
This your first time
being robbed?
You're doing great. Just smile so you
don't look like you're being held up.
You got a very pretty smile.
You got 20s? Give me the 20s.
I'll take those.
There you go.
I'll put those in my pocket.
There you go.
I have to give my partner a sign.
Now, that's good.
He's gonna wait
until I'm out of the building,
make sure you haven't set off the alarm.
If you have, he's gonna shoot your
Mr. Gwendon between the eyes. Okay?
- Okay.
- I think that'll do it, Loretta.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
You too.
Hey... she's cute, isn't she?
Yeah, she seems very nice.
Who was that?
No, no, no, no, no.
Son of a bitch!
Fuck! Fuck!
I think you flooded it.
Get out of the car, sir.
- Hey, you wanna hear a funny story?
- Shut up and get out of the car!
Yeah. Okay.
Go, go, go!
You want somethin', Foley?
Some fellas are goin' out of here.
What if I tell you where and when?
- How many?
- Expect you to look out for me,
let me run off work detail...
Okay, okay.
How many goin' out?
- I hear six.
- When?
- Tonight.
- You know who they are?
Yes, I do.
But I'm not gonna tell you just yet.
Meet me in the chapel,
just before lockdown. Okay?
- You all right?
- I love you, baby.
Tonight's the big night.
You excited?
- It's Super Bowl Sunday, okay?
- See you moved it up.
- Why you think that?
- I saw you runnin' this mornin'.
Stickin' to your routine
in case anybody happened to notice.
But you only did a couple of miles,
instead of your usual five.
Saving yourself for the big event. What
happened? Finish ahead of schedule?
Mira, you see those posts out there?
They're putting up another fence
already there, you know?
So you figure, mira,
we wait till Super Bowl Sunday,
they have that fence built...
then, cono, we gotta dig what,
another nine, ten days, baby?
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.
So tonight, when it gets dark,
batta-bing, I'm outta here.
Come on, Foley. You could come.
I appreciate the offer,
and it's tempting.
It's a long run to civilization.
What's it? A hundred miles to Miami?
I'm too old to be tryin'
a stunt like that.
So, you send me a postcard
when you get out.
- Adele Delisi speaking.
- Will you accept a collect call
from Jack Foley?
Yeah, I'll accept.
- Hey, Adele, how you doin'?
- Hey, bank robber.
Want some advice? Next time,
keep the engine running.
- Huh-huh. That's funny!
- What do you want, Jack?
Adele, you know that Super Bowl party
that was for next Sunday?
They changed the date.
It's tonight at 6:30.
- Didn't you tell me one time
calls aren't monitored?
- I said, not as a rule.
So why don't you just come right out
and tell me what you're talkin' about?
- Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth,
out there in the free world.
- Oh, yeah, what's free about it?
I'm lookin' for work.
- What about Mandrake the Magician?
- Emil, The Amazing, huh?
He fired me.
Hired a younger girl... a redhead.
Adele, the reason I'm calling...
they changed the date.
It is tonight. It's 6:30.
That's like a few hours from now.
- You tell Buddy...
- Okay, all right, and the guy
driving the other car?
- What are you talking about?
- Well, seeing as you have
so much luck with cars,
Buddy thought it might be
better to bring two, you know?
He got this guy who says
you know him, from Lompoc...
- Uh, Glenn somebody...
- Glenn Michaels.
Uh-huh, that's him. Buddy said
Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
- Adele?
- Yeah?
You tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing
his sunglasses, I'm gonna step on 'em.
- Might not even take 'em off first.
- Okay, honey. I'll do that.
Now, you try not to get shot. Bye.
Hey...
Here, ma'am.
Let me help you with these.
Beautiful young lady like you
shouldn't be carrying groceries.
Let a man do that for you.
Now, I didn't ask for your help,
so don't expect a tip.
Oh, that's okay, ma'am.
I'll just take your car.
Happy birthday.
Did you fit another
Chanel suit in here?
Something much better.
Go ahead, open it.
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.
- It's a, um...
- Sig Sauer 380.
- Right.
- Oh, I love it!
Thanks, Dad.
Happy birthday.
- How 'bout some more coffee?
- You know, I can't.
I have to go out to Glades, and then
I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at 10:00.
Which one is that?
The A.T.F. Guy?
Actually, he's with the F.B.I. Now.
He switched over.
- He's still married, though.
- Technically. They're separated.
- Well, so he's moved out then.
- He's about to.
- Well, then they're
not separated, are they?
- Can we not talk about this?
- What are you doing at Glades?
- Serving process...
a summons and complaint.
Some con doing mandatory life
doesn't like macaroni and cheese.
So, he files suit. Says he doesn't have
any choice in what they serve,
and that violates
his civil rights.
- You can step in, work full-time
as one of my investigators.
- No, thanks.
- You used to like it.
-  Dad.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers... nothing
wrong with them, if they're divorced.
Karen, why waste your time
on some cowboy cop...
who drinks too much
and cheats on his wife?
That's how those hot shots are...
all of 'em!
I really gotta go.
We don't talk much anymore.
How 'bout I come over Sunday
and we watch the Super Bowl together?
I'd like that.
Thanks for the gun, Dad.
They're right underneath you, Pup.
They dug a tunnel.
I don't hear anything.
Where's the tunnel come out?
Fourth post
from the guard tower.
I don't see nothin'.
You just keep watchin'.
Federal Bureau of Investigation,
how may I direct your call?
Yeah, this is Karen Sisco again
for Ray Nicolet.
Hold, please.
Yeah.
The line is busy.
Would you like his voice mail?
No, forget it.
I'll call back later.
- All right.
- Thanks.
Still don't see anything.
You will directly.
Wait a minute.
What the fuck?
Two men by the fence!
What the hell is she doin'?
Stop! Get your hands
in the air!
Tunnel's clear.
Seal up the north face.
- What happened?
- What the hell do you think,
jackass? Got a jail break!
Cubans out in the cane. Don't point
that thing at me. Hey, Buddy.
- It's okay, we're the good guys.
- What are you doing here?
All right. You're just a girl. What do
you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
- I'm a federal marshal
and you're under arrest.
- That's probably all the hacks.
Why don't we talk
about this later?
Watch your head.
I'm in. Let's go!
- Hey! You comfy?
- If I could have a little more room...
Well, there isn't any.
We got a lot of shit in here.
We got handcuffs in here.
What's in this can?
That's for your breath. You could
use it... squirt some in your mouth.
Yeah, well, that's mace, isn't it?
All right, you! Get...
Hey. Where's your gun... pistol?
In my bag, in the car.
Boy, it stunk in there.
I believe it. You're ruining
a $900 suit my dad gave me.
Yeah, it went great
with that 12-gauge too.
Why in the world would someone like you
become a federal marshal?
- The idea of going after
guys like you appealed to me.
- Sorry, what was that?
Guys like me?
Let me tell you something.
Even though I've been celibate lately,
I'm not going to force myself on you.
- I've never done that in my life.
- You wouldn't have time, anyway.
We come to a roadblock, they run the car
and find out who it belongs to.
That's if they get set up in time,
which I doubt. If they do,
they'll be lookin' for a bunch
of little Latin fellas, not
a big black guy drivin' a Ford.
He must be quite a pal,
to risk his own ass like this.
Buddy? Yeah, he's a good guy.
Back when we jailed together,
he used to call his sister
every week, without fail.
She's a born-again Christian. She does
bookkeeping for a televangelist.
He'd call her up,
confess his sins.
He'd tell her whatever bank
he happened to rob at the time.
Buddy... that
his given name?
The one I gave him, yeah.
So, what's your name?
Be in the paper
tomorrow, anyway.
Jack Foley.
You've probably heard of me.
- Why? Are you famous?
- The time I was convicted in California,
the F.B.I. Told me that I'd robbed
more banks than anybody in the computer.
- How many was that?
- Tell you the truth,
I don't really know.
Started when I was 18 years old,
driving for my Uncle Cully,
and his partner, Gus.
So, basically you're saying
you spent half your life in prison.
Basically, yeah.
I go back, I do 30 years. No time off.
- You imagine lookin' at that?
- I don't have to. I don't rob banks.
You don't seem all that scared.
- Of course I am.
- You don't act like it.
What do you want me
to do, scream?
That wouldn't help much, anyway.
No, I'm just gonna sit here, take it
easy, and wait for you to screw up.
You sound like my ex-wife.
- You were married?
- Just for about a year,
give or take a few days.
It's not like we didn't get along...
we had fun. We just...
didn't have... that thing,
you know, that uh...
- That spark, you know?
Gotta have that.
- Mm-hmm.
- We still talk, though.
- Sure.
This is not gonna end well.
These things never do.
If it turns out I get shot
like a dog, it's gonna be in the street,
not off a goddamn fence.
You must really see yourself
as some kind of Clyde Barrow, huh?
- You mean, of Bonnie and Clyde?
- Yeah.
The part in the movie where they get
shot, when it's Warren Beatty and...
- Faye Dunaway.
- Faye Dunaway, yeah.
- I like her in that movie about TV.
- Network, yeah, she was good.
And that guy says he's not gonna
take any more shit from anybody.
- Peter Finch.
- Yeah! Peter Finch.
"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not
gonna take any more of your shit!"
In that part where they get shot,
I can remember thinkin' to myself,
thinkin', "Hey, that wouldn't be
such a bad way to go, if you had to."
You sure are easy to talk to.
I was thinkin', if we met
under different circumstances...
if you were in a bar and
I came up and we started talkin'...
- I wonder what would happen.
- Nothing.
- If you didn't know who I was.
- You'd probably tell me.
- Just saying if we met
under different circumstances...
- You have got to be kidding.
Yeah. Yeah.
Another movie I liked with Faye Dunaway
was Three Days of the Condor.
The one with Robert Redford
when he was young.
Yeah.
You know, I never thought
it made sense, though...
you know, the way
they got together so quick.
Why not?
- I mean, romantically.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, but it... if... uh.
All right.
Here we go. All right.
Where the hell are we?
At the turnpike. Glenn's right above us
with the other car.
- All right, c'mon. Hop on out.
- Turn around and get your hands up!
- Shit!
-
We may as well leave her.
We're leavin' the car...
and we gotta leave her someplace,
anyway... what's the difference where?
- She's comin' with us.
- Jesus Christ, what were
you doing in there?
- Look for a name.
- I already looked.
Her name is Karen Sisco. Like
the Cisco Kid, only spelled different.
S-l-S-C-O.
Karen?
All right, Karen?
You be a good girl, now.
- I'm gonna open up the trunk.
-
Hey, hey, hey, now!
Now, you're puttin' holes in your car!
I'm not leavin' you.
I'm gonna open the trunk enough
for you to drop your pistol out.
Now, if you shoot, Buddy's got
your shotgun, he's gonna shoot back.
There's nothin' I can do about it,
so it's up to you.
Hey. Don't!
It's Glenn! Whoa!
Fuck! Hey, hey, Jack.
Good to see you, man.
What the fuck
are you guys shooting at?
- Do we need 'im?
- The cop saw this car.
- He might tie it to the break
and turn around.
- All right.
- Hey, Studs. We didn't recognize ya.
- Hey, "Studs," man.
I haven't heard that since Lompoc, man.
So what's goin' on?
Aw, nothin'.
Karen. Are you comin' out?
- You hear that?
- Okay!
Okay.
You win, Jack.
Now, you get your clothes cleaned,
you send me the bill.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
What, did you crawl through
a sewer, man? Who're you?
- Take your sunglasses off.
- I see better with 'em on, man.
You don't take 'em off
I'm gonna throw them off
while they're still on your head.
- Go wait in the car.
- Um, we're in civilization now,
so you can ease up a little bit.
I'm sorry. I'd like you
to wait in the car, please.
Take her, put her in the back.
- Okay. In the trunk?
- In the backseat! In the backseat!
- Backseat. Okay, you gotta come now,
'cause I gotta do this...
- Gimme your jacket.
Somebody forgot
to bring the clean clothes.
I brought 'em. They're at Glades
in the back of the Cadillac.
You decided to jump
into the trunk of her car.
You can blame me if you want.
I don't mind.
- Here, sir.
- I'll tell you...
- What's your problem, Jack?
- I don't know why you got Glenn
involved in this.
- How 'bout the score was
his idea to begin with?
- Idea...
The guy's got a fuckin'
vacant lot for a head.
He thinks he can talk
to me like that? Shit.
"Gimme your jacket." I have been
sitting here for over a half-hour,
watchin' out for the Highway Patrol,
if you think that's fun.
God. You know, I hadda go
over there in the bushes...
to smoke a joint, just so I could like,
you know?
Yep. I got somethin'
big lined up, up north.
Yeah, these guys? Wouldn't even fuckin'
know about it if it wasn't for me.
- Every time he opens his mouth,
I wanna punch him out.
- He's not the problem, Jack.
You wanna pull your head
outta your ass, tell me why the hell
we're bringing her with us?
- Glenn.
-
You don't remember me, do you?
Um, couldn't have been Glades
if that's what you're thinkin',
'cause I was never out there.
- No, that's not what I'm thinking.
- Oh, yeah?
But you're sure
we've met, huh?
- Last fall.
-
I drove you from the Palm Beach County
Jail to the federal courthouse... twice.
You're Glenn Michaels.
I never forget anybody
I've cuffed and shackled.
Now let's think about this for a minute,
Glenn, see if we can't work it out.
Do we have a gun in the car?
Oh, shit!
I remember you! Hey!
Foley's not gonna make it,
and if he goes down, you go with him.
- Now, look. I can understand
if you guys are close, but...
- No, we're not.
- But, yeah. I'm helpin' him.
- Now wait a minute, Glenn.
Have you helped him?
I mean, technically,
at this point, I doubt you could be
charged with aiding a fugitive.
So you still have a choice.
You wanna take her to my place, get
cleaned up, come out of the bathroom...
with your aftershave on, and she goes,
"Oh. I had you all wrong."
No. I just wanna talk
to her again, that's all.
I just wanna see what it might have
been like under normal circumstances.
- It's too late for that, Jack.
-
He wants to get out of here,
and I don't blame him.
Ref don't call it soon, Snoop's gonna
send this cat out in a body bag.
Anybody ever tell you
why they call him "Snoopy"?
He used to be
Maurice "Mad Dog" Miller...
back when he was a pro.
Now you pet him,
he goes down.
- I don't believe it!
- Oh, my!
Bullshit! Bullshit!
Yeah, you the man.
Guy's bragging he won
a thrown fight.
Fuckin' pathetic.
Dangerous is what it is.
- Who's the bald dude?
- Richard Ripley.
The Wall Street guy?
Call him Dick The Ripper on account
of all the guys he ripped off.
Oh, yeah. I didn't
recognize him without his rug.
- What's his bid?
- Three years.
You guys on the bench? Okay.
Three years, fined $50 million
and wrote 'em a fuckin' check.
Just like that.
Fifty mill, signed his name.
Didn't even... Didn't even...
Okay, a little help.
Okay, heavy!
Heavy! Come on!
All the bright glare out here,
you couldn't read the numbers
on the weights.
Oh. I had it. Jesus.
- How do you know he wrote a check?
- Uh, he told me.
We work laundry together.
Guy loves to fucking talk.
Yeah, he loves to talk.
He talked to the U.S. Attorney.
Rolled over on all the snitches
he was doing business with.
Hey! Any guy who can write
a fuckin' check for $50 million,
he says anything,
I'm all fuckin' ears.
Guy tells me he's got
all this money in foreign banks.
Plus, around, mmm,
five million in uncut diamonds
at his house.
He said, quote,
that I can get my hands on it
at any time.
- Where does he live?
- Detroit.
Snoopy Miller says that uncut diamonds
are as easy to move as cash.
Ever seen
an uncut diamond, Studs?
Looks just like
a plain, old rock.
- Wait, you think this guy's lying?
-
What do you think, Studs? Use
your head. Some guy's got $5 million...
socked away in his house,
and he's gonna tell some motormouth
he just met in prison about it.
Oh, I see.
You guys are cynical. Right.
Here it comes.
Keep on walking. Keep walking.
You don't wanna be
answering any questions.
I'm just saying
she wasn't scared, that's all.
That's 'cause she had
her hand on her gun the whole time
waitin' to make her move.
You're just jealous 'cause
it was me in the trunk with her...
- and not you.
- You're right.
The first thing I'm gonna do...
is get this mud off me.
Hey.
Karen?
Karen, honey?
Karen?
You were talking
in your sleep.
What'd I say?
"Hey, yourself."
- Huh.
-
Hello, Daniel.
Daniel Burdon, F.B.I.
Marshall Sisco, Karen's dad.
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
Umm...
Would you mind, please,
waiting outside?
We have some business
to do here.
Well, uh, I have
to use the john anyway.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
I wanna be
on the task force, Daniel.
Well...
That's nice of you
to offer, Karen, but...
I got all the help
I can use right now.
Instead, let's talk about
how you got that bump on your head.
Isn't that my file
you're holding on to?
Yes, but I want
to hear it from you,
starting... with when
you grabbed the wheel.
Where was this?
Coming to the Okeechobee exit.
-  Sit back!
- Can you see with those glasses on?
I'm fine!
This is... stupid, man.
These guys are gonna be
so disappointed in me, man.
You know what?
If I wasn't stoned,
there is no way that you would have
talked me into this.
- Remember that.
- Get off at the exit
right after that bridge.
No, I am not fucking turning
myself in, so forget it!
- Get off at that exit!
- What exit?
- That exit right there. Take that exit!
- Sit back! No!
The next thing I knew,
the paramedics were
pulling me out of the car.
- You all right?
-  There's a couple
of points I keep wondering about...
have to do with the two guys
that grabbed you.
Buddy, is it?
And this fella Jack Foley.
I swear, the man must have robbed
over 200 banks in his time.
- Really?
- Um-hmm.
He told me he didn't
remember how many he robbed.
Then you talked to him.
In the trunk, yeah.
What'd you talk about?
Different things.
Prison, movies.
This fella holds you hostage,
you talk about movies?
It was an unusual experience.
You know, Foley made me think
of that fella Carl Tillman.
The one that you were seeing,
it turns out, the same time
he was robbing banks.
- Do you recall that?
- And what happened to Carl?
The time came, you shot him. But you
didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.
They're unarmed, you had a shotgun
and you let them throw you in the trunk.
Okay. Now you got
your Sig in your hand,
and you say in the report
that you couldn't turn around.
He had you pinned down.
But when the trunk opened,
how come you didn't
cap the two guys then?
What do you work on most of the time?
Fraud? Go after crooked bookkeepers?
Karen, I've been with the bureau
- Have you ever shot a man?
- No.
- When was the last time you were
primary through the door?
- I have to qualify?
You have to know
what you're talking about.
We'll talk another time.
All right, Karen?
I'd like to know why Foley
put you in that second car
when he didn't need you anymore.
You'll have to ask him that.
Rip, Rip.
- What the deal is, baby?
- Hi, Maurice.
- Oops. I don't know.
- Make a fist...
- There you go.
- Fuck it, man.
- Got your little fishies for you.
- Oh, good.
Not so fast. Starting out,
there's gonna be an across the board
cost of living increase.
- What?
- When I got put in here a year ago
on credit card fraud,
I didn't really get
no props for that.
But ever since I shanked
that loudmouth pussy in the yard,
it's like my Dun and Broadstreet around
this bitch done shot way the fuck up.
Actually, it's Dun and Bradstreet.
That's the, uh...
Well, I've heard it both ways.
Point is that the price
has gone up around this bitch too.
Get your little black book out.
We got some business to talk about.
For the little fishies...
What'd I say they was gonna be?
- Two thousand.
- Now they're gonna be three thousand.
- Come on. You...
- Now they're gonna be three thousand.
That saltwater shit
you put in your eyes?
- What do you call that?
- Bausch & Lomb.
Yeah, that bushy lawn shit.
That's 300.
- I need it.
- Yeah, you do. And that extra pillow.
I'm gonna get that for you,
but that's gonna be like five C's.
- Five?
-  Hey.
Sign says shut the fuck up,
or can't you fellas read?
Who the fuck
you talkin' to, man?
You got a problem
over there, Foley?
Yeah, this is
the dumbest fucking shakedown
in the history of dumb shakedowns.
- Five hundred bucks for a pillow?
- That's right.
- It does seem a little high,
doesn't it?
- Shut up, Dick.
- Must be a nice pillow.
- Full goose down.
- Look, you still...
- How much for your company at chow?
My company? Come on, man. You know
I'll watch this motherfucker's back.
- How much?
- That's a C-note.
If you're smart, Ripley,
you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
Really?
Well, l... l...
I don't know.
First of all, if he kills you,
then he's gonna get nothin'.
Well, uh, the man don't
just have to die, Foley.
He could accidentally hurt himself
falling down on something real hard.
Like a shiv or my dick.
I'll pay. I'll pay it.
Don't worry.
If he falls on anything, Snoop,
then they're gonna transfer
his ass outta here faster
than you can throw a fight...
and you're still
gonna get nothin'.
You know, last time I checked, man,
this shit over here ain't
got nothin' to do with you.
Why don't you go outside?
Smoke a cigarette or some shit.
I don't smoke.
You heard the man. Why don't
you get your punk ass up outta here?
- Uh-oh.
- You fucked up now, man. That's Himey.
Protégé of mine. Ranked number 32
in the federal prison system.
- Thirty-two?
- That's right.
- Out of, what, 20.
- Kick this cracker's ass.
- What's going on here?
- Uh, nothin'.
Just "reading is fundamental" shit.
We got all excited and everything.
Clear outta here. Now.
- No problem.
- All of you. Let's go.
Uh, Snoopy.
I think we settled the fish thing.
Oh, the fish. Yeah.
That's how you
do the shake, partner.
Paper says there's ten grand each
on you, Chino and Lulu.
They say anything about Karen?
Just that she got away. Here.
- Hmm?
- Jack!
-  Hey!
- That's all right. It's in the pool.
Did it say what happened to her
after she took off with Glenn?
I don't know.
You'll have to ask Glenn.
He's probably on his way to Detroit,
which is where we should be.
- Yeah.
- Do you realize what you're doing?
Worrying about a woman
who works for law enforcement?
You wanna sit down and have cocktails
with a woman who tried to shoot you.
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Do you think this old guy's
her boyfriend?
It's the only picture
she has in here.
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
The longer we stay here,
the better chance there is...
that either Glenn
is gonna screw up the score,
or we gonna get busted or both.
This is Foley?
- Karen?
- Hmm?
- This is Foley?
-   How lucky can one guy be
-
- Doesn't even look like that.
- Oh, no?
- Uh-uh. He looks a lot like...
Different.
Wyatt Earp is here.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- How you feelin'? Feel better?
- Good. Yeah.
- Is your dad taking good care of you?
- He took the week off...
to take care of me and he's worked on
his boat every day since.
- Dad, this is Ray Nicolet.
- Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.
- Likewise.
Ray's working with the F.B.I.
Task force on the prison break.
I see that. Tell me, Ray, do you ever
wear one that says "undercover"?
- No.
- How's it going?
Sit down.
Okay. Good.
We caught one of them.
- Was it Foley?
- Was it off a tip?
Somebody spotted two of them
out in this hobo camp near the airport.
Called in the number.
That was it.
- I knew it as soon
as I as there was a reward.
- Was it Foley?
No, Linares,
one of the Cubans.
We went in there with full SWAT,
two choppers, that whole deal.
Linares goes nuts,
starts shooting, so we took him out.
I don't know how Chirino
got away, but he did.
- And Foley hadn't been there.
- No, this place was strictly Cuban.
Foley had a ride. He must have
his own agenda. You know what I mean?
He seems to be the only guy
who kinda knows what he's doing.
- Uh-huh.
-
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
Hello?
Yeah, she is.
Just a minute, please.
Karen.
- Hello?
- Hi.
You know who this is?
Yes.
Five minutes.
So. Ray.
- Yeah.
- There's something I'm wondering.
The headline reads, "I slept with
a murderer, says shaken Miami woman."
- Who is it that answered the phone?
- None of your business.
I'm just worried maybe
I'm not old enough for you.
- It was my dad.
- Really?
- He's got a cop's face.
- How do you know?
- Oh, wait. You have my wallet.
- And your gun.
- Think I can have 'em back?
- How do we do that?
You can come by my dad's place
and drop 'em off.
I could leave it with the SWAT guy
that answers the door.
There's a guy here
on the task force right now.
Maybe I should put him on the phone
and let the two of you work it out.
- You wouldn't do that.
- Why not?
Because you're having
too much fun.
She fixes him pork chops and rice.
The next thing you know,
they're making love on the sofa.
She says he was very gentle.
This guy, Chirino, shows up at the
house, says he misses his little girl.
She feels sorry for him.
Next thing you know... boom.
- On the couch.
- That's how you score now, huh?
I guess.
There's something
I've been wondering.
Whatever happened
to your Uncle Cully?
You think he's gonna
tell you where I am?
- Unless you wanna tell me.
- He's dead.
Did 27 years before he got out,
and he died a couple of years afterwards
in a charity hospital...
by trying to make up
for all the good times he missed.
That's not gonna be me.
What, one last score, retire
to some island? Is that the idea?
- Jack.
- I'm partial to mountains myself,
but if you like islands,
we'll make it an island.
- What do you mean,
"we'll make it an island"?
- You and I can make it...
- Jack, you better come
and check this out.
- Is that Buddy?
- What? No. Okay. Bye-bye.
- Who're you talking to?
- So she's a married woman.
- Right.
But she goes to bed
with a prison escapee because...
he tells her that
he misses his little girl.
She tells the world about it.
But you protect her.
You don't reveal her name.
That makes it sound like
what she was doing was okay...
as long as her husband
doesn't find out.
Like the guy who cheats
on his wife, saying what
she doesn't know won't bother her.
- Dad.
- What?
Ray, I wanna show you
something... in the living room.
- Yeah.
- Good talking to you, Ray.
Yeah, you too.
Federal law enforcement
agents raided a squatters camp...
north of Miami International
Airport this morning...
in the hopes of capturing
a fugitive from Tuesday's daring escape
from Glades prison.
F.B.I. Officials confirm that
one of the escapees, Arelio Linares,
- was killed...
-  Chino's gonna
wanna talk to me.
-
- Chino's runnin' for his life.
He don't give a shit about you.
He's gonna know by now
I gave him up back at Glades.
He's gonna wanna find me.
Maybe see Adele,
see what she knows.
He knows where she lives?
Jack!
We were talking once,
drinking rum,
and I may have
mentioned Adele.
How she worked for a magician.
Chino got all interested.
He said, "How do you saw
the woman in half?"
Maybe he wanted to meet her,
maybe see her if she came to visit.
Oh, okay, okay. So you call her up
and tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
- The phone's probably tapped by now.
- You're right.
And if the phone is tapped,
you know they have her place staked out.
- Shit!
-
Adele Delisi speaking.
-  Uh, uh, this is Adele?
- Yes, it is.
Oh... Uh, sorry.
Wrong number.
Nice disguise.
I'm a tourist.
All right. Here we go.
Coming up right here...
on the left.
- What about the guy with the clippers?
- I wonder what the F.B.I...
is charging to trim hedges
these days?
- Quite a checker game
they got goin' on too.
- Pull on up.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
Okay, you saw her.
That's all you get.
- Let's go to Detroit.
- Now you're talkin', brother.
I'll say one thing for Jack...
he's very considerate.
Lights on or off,
if you know what I mean.
- Really.
- Hmm.
Adele, listen...
I just want to find him
before he does something else
and makes it worse on himself.
No.
Buddy'll take care of him.
Keep him out of trouble.
He's Jack's conscience, always has been.
They must have robbed
- They were a really great team.
- Until they got busted.
Hmm. That wasn't Jack's fault,
no, that was on account of...
Buddy, for some reason, decided to call
his sister and confess to the job...
before they'd done it
instead of after.
Well, she called the F.B.I. They both
went down, and they ended up at Lompoc.
I think Buddy felt
kind of bad about that.
Adele, do you have any idea
where I could find Buddy?
- Or Glenn?
-
Mira, Adele, you in there?
- Yes.
- Mira, I'd like to speak to you, please.
- Well, who is it?
- Emile, you know, the guy
you used to work for?
- Uh...
- He gave me your number
and where you live.
Mira, I'm looking for an assistant.
Can I speak to you, please?
- Oh. Uh, yeah.
- All right.
You did work for Emile, right?
Uh, yeah, I was Emile's box jumper
for four years, almost.
Cono! You were what, his box?
- Uh, his assistant.
- Oh, okay.
You say you perform
in the Miami area?
Oh, si. Here, there, you know.
I was a magician in Cuba. They used
to call me Manuelito the Magician.
Mira, can you please open?
- I'm not dressed.
- I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
- You know Jack?
- Who are you?
Jose Chirino.
Or maybe you heard Jack call me Chino.
Bueno, I'm the same guy.
Tell him he has to wait in the hall.
You have to get dressed. Say it loud.
Wait in the hall.
You have to get dressed.
Mira, mira, you tell me
where I could find Jack
and I don't bother you no more.
Now, come on, please! Hello?
- I don't know where he is.
- I'm the guy that helped
Jack escape from prison.
- Mira, please open this fucking door...
- I'm gonna call the police.
Cono, why you gonna do that
to a friend, man? A partner to Jack?
That's it! That's it!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Cono, mira, please!
- Adele! Adele!
- Give me your hand.
- You not Adele!
- I'm a federal marshal,
and you're under arrest.
- Get my bag, Adele.
- Oh.
Mira, please, please. I think
there's a misunderstanding here.
Can you...
you got nice bag.
Mira, let's say we just forget about it,
okay? We forget about this, I go home...
- Shut up.
- Owwww! Who the hell
taught you how to do that?
- Give me your other hand.
- Okay, okay. Ay, cono.
Ohhhh!
I gotta go make pee-pee.
Ohhhhh! Owww!
Wow! You are mean!
Look, I'm gonna call my lawyer.
This is... What do they call that?
Human rights violation.
- Ay, cono.
- Daniel Burdon, please. Karen Sisco.
Mira, Adele, Adele.
Can I ask you a question, please?
You know that trick you do?
Karen? Where are you?
I've been trying to reach you.
When you in the box
and they saw you in half?
- I'm at Adele Delisi's.
- It's magic.
We already talked to her.
That's a dead end.
I was just wondering,
if I brought in Chirino,
would you let me be on the task force?
- Yeah, sure, Karen.
- Then they put the saw through,
and they separate it.
- And that's it. Ta da.
- But how do you twinkle your toes?
I don't get that.
You bring Chirino in,
and you can be on the task force.
- That's all I wanted to know.
- Good.
Now, would you forget
about the ex-wife,
and get over to the Adams Hotel?
- You got it.
- Then they open it up...
- No! No!
- Come on.
- And then that's it.
- Fake legs.
- Mmm.
- Fake legs? How you gonna...
- Ay! Cono.
- Thanks, Adele.
How do they twinkle their toes,
then, if it's fake, mira?
First thing we do,
we get to Detroit, we find Glenn,
and we find a window
to throw him out of.
I was thinkin', if I was Glenn,
and I was up there...
to take down the Ripper,
where would I go?
'Cept that if you were Glenn,
you wouldn't be thinkin'.
Remember Snoopy Miller,
his old pal from the joint?
Snoop? I figured
he'd be brain-dead by now.
Nah, Snoop doesn't box anymore.
Glenn told me that he's managing
some fighters out at the Kronk.
- Did you get the key?
- They're in room 613.
All right. I want
two men outside, front and back.
Conroy, Jamison, go on up to six,
cover both ends of the hall.
You're primary.
You're secondary.
And you're point man.
- You gonna use a ram?
- Yeah. Why?
The manager's door is metal.
You know what I mean,
they might all be.
A ram on a metal door makes
a lot of noise for what good it does.
I got a shock lock round
for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.
Fine. Whatever.
Two, please.
You.
Fuck it.
Let's take the stairs. Karen...
Take the radio. Stay down here
in the lobby and watch the elevator.
- Daniel, I want to go upstairs.
- Well, you can wait
in the car if you want to.
Now, you see Foley and Bragg
coming behind us. What do you do?
- Call and tell you?
- And you let them come up.
You don't try to make
the bust yourself. You understand?
Is this your floor, ma'am?
Is this your floor, ma'am?
Oh. Oh, yes.
Yes, it is. I'm sorry. Thank you.
Be advised we are
approaching the door.
Be advised we are
going to blow the door.
Going up?
Shit, I thought I was going up.
She just looked right at me.
- Who?
- Karen.
- Karen Sisco?
- Yeah.
She's in the lobby.
- She's in the lobby?
- Yeah.
They know where I live,
no doubt they know what I drive.
We gotta dump this car.
She just sat there,
looking right at me.
Karen, they're
not up here. Keep your eyes open.
Karen? Karen, are you there?
He waved at you?
Couldn't swear to it,
but I'm pretty sure he did.
- Did you wave back?
- I didn't have time.
I imagine you would have, though.
Buddy's sister, Regina Mary Bragg,
got two calls from Buddy
in Detroit this morning.
She calls Burdon.
She's also the one who called Burdon...
- and gave him Buddy's address.
- So?
So what I want to know is why he still
calls her even after she turned him in.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.
What I want to know is why,
they got such a big score up north, did
Foley hang around Miami for so long?
- Any thoughts on that?
- None I'd like to share.
- I'll call you when I get in.
- Okay.
Hey
Time is truly wasting
You know, I don't just deal product
and manage fighters no more.
A lot's changed since the last time
you seen me, man. It's like I've, uh,
vertically integrated myself,
you know, diversified and shit,
and now I'm into
the occasional grand larceny,
- home invasion, shit like that.
- Huh.
White Boy Bob right there's
my all-around man, you know.
He's my personal bodyguard when I feel
like I need one, driver, shit like that.
Yo, man, watch the road, White Boy!
What you lookin' back here for?
-  Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I like this car, Glenn.
- Yeah.
You stole a good one, boy.
You can roll around
in Ripley's neighborhood
up there in Bloomfield Hills,
not get sweated
by the private security.
Ain't gonna have no police on our ass,
nothing like that. It's nice, man.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, so you still haven't said
how you want to do this thing.
Oh, I'm gonna tell you that
as soon as we get one other
brother I'm gonna need, uh,
Kenneth...
that's Moselle's brother...
along with White Boy right there.
- What?
- All right, here we go, White Boy.
Uh, who's the fireman?
Ken dog.
- What's up, brother-in-law?
- What's happenin', hustler?
Hey, man. This cigarette
gonna bother you, Mo?
Yeah, put that thing out, all right?
Ken, this is Glenn.
- Glenn, that's Kenny,
the dude I was tellin' you about.
- Hi.
You're the one gonna help us
rip off that rich white dude?
- Yeah, that's him.
-  Help you?
Go ahead, White Boy.
Um, whoa, wait a minute, um, look...
Maurice, I am
letting you in on this gig,
not...
- You just asked
how we gonna do it, right?
- Yeah.
Well, I'm telling you how, man.
We the experts.
Person I'm worried about
is you, Glenn.
- Me?
- Yeah.
Can you step up and actually do this
shit instead of just talking the talk?
Do what?
Walk into this house
I got picked out.
Do this cross-dressing nigger
named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to.
- Been dealing on his own.
- What? When, man?
Shit, right now, son.
What you think all this shit is for?
I don't need to prove
shit to you, man, okay?
The Ripley job is my job.
You're either in or you're not.
You wanna go pop some crack dealer
pissed you off, man,
- that is your problem,
not mine, fuck!
- Glenn,
I know you supposed to be
cool and everything, okay,
but you ain't got
to give me no tone of voice.
You don't like what I'm sayin',
you just bounce the fuck out
this whip anywhere up in here.
Okay, I think we're forgetting
that this is my whip.
I brought it up.
Shit. Hey, come on, man. If I say
this is my car, you know this is my car.
You just get yourself
another one.
If I say we in on this Ripley shit, we
in on it, with or without your punk ass.
And if I say you gonna walk up in
this house and do this motherfucker...
so I can see if you got
any balls or not,
guess what else you gonna do?
We're here.
Tighten up your panties, boy.
- Hacksaw. Okay, I'll take that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hatchet, man.
- Hatchet?
-
- What are you gonna do with a hatchet?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's get some fire to that ass.
Look here.
You want the.45 or the Glock?
Glenn?
Shit, boy.
It was worse than you thought
it was gonna be, huh?
You with the bad boys now, baby.
Let's go.
What do you think?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and
now we got ourselves another partner.
Hey, Studs, how ya doin'?
Jesus Christ,
what are you guys doin' here?
Weren't you expecting us?
Where's your sunglasses?
Somebody finally step on 'em for ya?
- I don't know.
- Whose blood you got on your shirt?
Listen, man,
these guys are crazy.
- Snoop!
- Shit.
We have a problem here?
Jack Foley,
famous bank robber.
Snoopy Miller,
famous fight thrower.
Seems I read somewhere that you
broke out of a prison down in Florida.
- Is that right?
- They got a low class
of people there, Snoop.
Hey, you call him that again I'm gonna
put your head through the wall.
What? You mean "Snoop"?
Nobody calls me Snoop or Snoopy
anymore is what White Boy Bob
is trying to tell you.
He's just a little crude with it.
You know what I mean?
Nah, I left all that
behind me, partner.
But you call this bozo
"White Boy."
White Boy Bob
used to be a fighter.
Oh, so tell me, what do you
do now, White Boy Bob,
outside of shoot
your big mouth off?
- Like being back in the yard, isn't it?
- Yeah, just like it.
Nobody backing down
or nothing.
- You back down, you just a pussy.
-
- Why y'all in Detroit anyway,
up here in the cold?
- Glenn didn't tell you?
- Glenn? What?
- I thought you guys were busted.
Why's that? 'Cause you left us
standing on the side of the road?
Whoops.
Look, Snoop, I don't know
what Glenn promised you,
or what you think you're going
to get out of this... here's the deal:
Buddy and I, we're going to take half
of anything we get off of Ripley.
Anything else, you guys are
allowed to cut up any way you want.
Oh. Why don't we talk
about this outside, man?
- Nice in here. It's warm.
- Warm? It's like
Sometimes it's 100 up in this mug.
That's the way Emmanuel
like to keep it.
Keep his fighters mean and lean like
Tommy Hearns. Ain't that right, Kenny?
I got someplace to be anyway,
so tell you what:
Why don't y'all come by
the fights Friday night?
We'll sit down,
chop it up, you know, look it over.
- State Theater.
- All right. We'll see you then.
So it must take a lot of balls
to walk into a bank and
stick it up with a gun, huh?
I don't know. I never used
a gun before in my life.
You're kidding.
You'd be surprised what all you can get
if you ask for it the right way.
Well, you're the reason, my friend, that
I don't keep all my money in the bank.
So where do you keep
your money, Dick?
Talking about all those
uncut diamonds you told about.
- I know what you're talking about.
- You're the one with balls.
Say something like that
to somebody like Glenn?
Glenn? Come on, nobody's
going to believe Glenn.
- Do you believe Glenn?
- Uh, no, I don't.
Besides, even if it was true,
he'd still have to know
where I keep 'em, wouldn't he?
Doesn't have to know anything.
You told him you keep 'em in your house.
It's a very big house.
So, how much longer you in here for?
Uh, 22 months,
three days, two hours.
- Why?
- 'Cause I could use a guy like you.
Somebody that knows how to ask
for things in the right way.
I'm talking about
when you're out of here.
After all, you can't rob banks
forever, can you?
- I'm not exactly a nine to five type.
- Who is?
I thought everybody liked Eddie.
- How you doin', Ray?
- I'm freezing.
But I'm getting warmer.
So listen, other than we had so much fun
the last time we worked together,
you want to tell me why you're coming
to me instead of the F.B.I.?
I go to the F.B.I.,
the first thing they're
gonna do is send me to get some coffee.
You know what?
You're right.
Ray, about a year ago,
D.E.A. Had a guy, Glenn Michaels,
on possession with intent.
- Listen, is that your car?
Find out whose it is.
- They couldn't make it stick.
In his statement, he said he was coming
to Detroit to see a friend...
about job opportunities,
if you can believe that.
- What was the name of the friend?
- Maurice Miller,
also known as Snoopy,
used to be a prizefighter.
I know Snoopy.
He's a fucking wack job.
He thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard,
hangs out over on the west side...
with a couple of other
first-rate nut cases.
- Well, I'm gonna need
a last known address.
- 2710 coming in.
- You're gonna need what?
- A last known address.
That your car?
No way. I don't want you
talking to Miller alone.
Come on, Ray. I'm a federal officer.
I can handle myself. I'm armed.
I'll call you tomorrow
with the address.
Thank you, Raymond.
You see the paper?
-  It's a terrific shot of her.
-  Outside of that.
Doesn't say what she's doing here,
but I don't think it has
anything to do with us.
She came up here on her vacation
because she likes shitty weather.
Nah, I think she's after Glenn.
The girl still there?
They don't stay the whole night, Jack,
unless you pay for it.
- Did you tell your sister?
- Yeah, I just hung up.
She prayed for me.
- Mm-hmm. And how long were you
on the phone with her?
- Two hours.
- And how long were you with the girl?
- 45 minutes.
You didn't tell your sister
about Ripley, did you?
Look, Jack, just forget
about my sister, okay?
Now, if Karen Sisco is
tailing Glenn, we're fucked.
Tomorrow night at the fights,
we all get picked up.
Why don't we just drive by where
we're meeting tonight, check it out.
And we'll go by Ripley's too,
while we're at it.
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.
- Athenaeum Hotel, how may I help you?
- Karen Sisco, please.
- Hello, Best Western.
- Karen Sisco, please.
- Moselle Miller?
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for Maurice.
- You find him, tell him
the dog got run over.
I'm out of grocery money.
- Moselle, who you talkin' to?
- Lady lookin' for Maurice.
- What does she want?
- Hasn't said.
- That's not Maurice?
- That's Kenneth, my brother.
He's talkin' on the phone.
- Ask her what she want with him!
- You ask her!
- Maurice business
is none of my business.
- Yeah, you damn right.
State Theater, huh?
Who's fightin'?
Nigger, what?
I'm looking for somebody
I think Maurice knows.
You're not with probation,
one of those?
- No.
- You a lawyer?
No, I'm not. I'm looking
for somebody named Glenn Michaels.
Glenn? I don't know any Glenn.
He said he stayed here
last November.
- Here in this house?
- He said he stayed with Maurice.
Well, he ain't
even here that much.
I'd like to know where he goes,
but at the same time,
I don't wanna know,
you understand?
Yeah.
- You say your dog was killed?
- Got run over by a car.
- What'd you call him?
- Was a she. Named Tuffy.
Where do you think
I might find Maurice, Moselle?
I don't know.
The gym, the fights.
I know he don't miss the fights.
They're havin' some tomorrow
down at the State Theater.
- He used to take me.
- The State Theater.
Why you askin'
all these questions about Maurice?
She lookin' for a man name of Glenn.
Did I ask you? Go on and do something
with yourself, Moselle.
Why don't you take your ass
to Dot and Etta's and get us
some shrimp or somethin'?
- You're a fighter.
- How you know that?
- I can tell.
- Yeah, I was.
'Til I got my retina
detached two times.
- What'd you fight, about middleweight?
- Nah, light.
Super middleweight,
once my body developed.
- What you go about, what, a bantam?
- Flyweight.
Nigger, what?
You know your divisions, huh?
Do you like the fights?
You like the rough stuff?
Yeah, I bet you do.
You like to get down
and tussle a little bit?
Like me and Tuffy,
before she got run over.
We used to get down on the floor
and tussle all the time.
I'd say to her, "You a good bitch,
Tuffy. Here's a treat for ya."
And I give Tuffy what all good bitches
love best, and you know what that is?
Know what that is? A bone.
I'll give you
a good bone too, girl.
- You're not my type.
-
No, that shit
don't mean nothin' to me.
- I let the monster out,
you gonna do what it wants.
- I gotta go, Kenneth.
- Maybe we'll see each other again.
- No, no, we gonna tussle first.
Awww!
Damn it!
What the fuck was that?
You wanted to tussle.
We tussled.
That's a big ass house.
Place almost looks
like a prison.
No doubt he's got some
serious security system.
Time comes, we go up, knock on the door,
see if he wants to talk about old times.
- You know, the easy way.
- Cool.
Think he'll let us in, we got the Snoop
and that musclebound asshole with us?
Nobody's gonna be with us.
I say we go to the fights tomorrow
night, see what Snoopy's big plan is,
then we go in,
ahead of him, alone.
Oh, I can dig it.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop,
while we off livin' the good life.
Good life. Buddy, you know anybody
who's done one last big score...
and then gone on
to live the good life?
Look, Jack, there's a chance
we'll walk out of here with nothin'.
I say,
let fate decide.
Let fate decide? What are you,
the fuckin' Dalai Lama now?
Nah, man,
it's my sister.
My sister believes
in fate but not hell.
That's why she stopped praying
for all the lost souls,
since you don't hear that much
about purgatory anymore.
But every day, she asks her boss
to pray that Buddy don't fuck up.
-
- I mean, what do you think?
- Well...
- You think there's a hell?
Yeah, it's called
the Glades Correctional Institute.
I'm sure as shit not going back there
or any place like it.
They put a gun on you,
you'll go, brother.
They put a gun on you,
you still have a choice.
So, Mr. Foley,
Mr. Ripley and I have
had a long discussion
about your role in the company,
and it was his feeling you'd be
happiest working down here in Miami.
- How's that sound to you?
- Sounds great.
Good. You're about
a 42 long, right?
I uh, I'm about a 42...
like, 42 regular.
- Okay, let's see how she fits.
- What is that?
Your uniform.
My uniform.
Mr. Foley. Mr. Foley!
Sir, sir. Excuse me, sir.
Sir! Sir, excuse me!
- You can't go in there!
- Are you fucking kidding me?
A security guard?
- What are you, stoned?
- Hey, hey! Take it easy!
It's all right, Peggy.
It's under control.
You know something?
I wasn't sure that you'd show up here,
but I was very sure if you did,
you'd throw this job
in my face.
Let me tell you
something.
Every single thing you've done
with your life up until this point...
in the real world
means nothing.
Less than nothing.
You're a bank robber.
That's not
a very marketable skill.
We don't see a lot
of old bank robbers walking around...
with a pension plan,
now do we?
I think you know this.
That's why you're here.
Today, I've offered you...
a lousy job with a lousy wage.
You want something better?
Why don't you show me you can change?
Then I'll offer you
something better, a lot better.
But until then, my friend,
you'll have to earn it.
How, Dick?
The way you earn it?
Married some rich broad
owns the company,
selling it off a piece at a time
then divorcing her?
What's this Knute Rockne "pull yourself
up by the bootstraps" bullshit?
Back in prison, a guy like you
in a place like that?
You were ice cream for freaks.
A goddamned dumpling.
Maurice and a dozen other guys would
have bled you till you had nothing.
Until you were nothing.
I saved your ass!
So you'll pardon me if I don't want
to sit on a fucking stool all day,
and say, "Sign in here, please,"
or "Hey, pal, you can't park here."
All right, Dick?
I can't fuckin' do it, Dick!
- I'm disappointed in you.
- You wanna...
Oh, here we go.
What job did he promise you boys?
- There's two ways we can do this.
- Yeah, what are they?
Hey, Buddy, I gotta get a better pair
of shoes and some things for tomorrow.
Drop me off by the Ren Center
and we'll hook up later?
Yeah, okay.
I better go call my sister.
Can I get you anything?
Yeah, I'll have a bourbon, please.
Water back.
Okay.
Hey, Tad, why don't
you do us again, please?
Oh, and, Celeste,
put the lady's drink on our bill.
- They want to buy your drink for you.
- Yeah, I get that.
- Tell them I'd rather pay for my own.
- Okay.
I'll find out.
Excuse me.
My associates and I,
we made a little bet...
on what you do
for a living.
And I won.
Hi, I'm Phillip.
If it's okay with you,
Phillip, I'd rather just
have a quiet drink and leave.
Don't you want to know what I guessed?
How I know what you do for a living?
Really, Phillip, I don't want to be
rude. I just want to be left alone.
It's a little cold over there.
Excuse me.
I think I know why you're depressed.
If I can offer
my observation.
See, I got a hunch
you're the new sales rep,
and the client's not exactly knocked out
by the fact that a young lady...
even one as stunning as yourself...
is handling the account.
Am I close?
I'm Andy.
We're all ad guys. Flew in this morning
from the apple... New York.
Came in to pitch
Hiram Walker Distillery.
Little test market campaign
for the new margarita mix.
It's really pretty interesting.
We take this, um,
Mex... um,
Hispanic bandito...
with his bullet belts and everything,
and the big Chihuahua hat,
and he pulls out
his six-guns,
- and these guys back here...
- Andy.
Really.
Who gives a shit?
- Do you want to tell me what happened?
- Beat it, Andy.
Andy.
What'd you do?
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Yeah, I'd love one.
Sit down.
I'm Gary.
I'm Celeste.
- It takes forever to get a drink.
There's only one waitress.
- I can go to the bar.
- Oh, don't go.
- Are those guys bothering you?
No, they're fine.
I mean, you just got here.
Here, help yourself.
- You like bourbon?
- I love it.
We got that out of the way. Tell me,
Celeste, what do you do for a living?
I'm a sales rep,
and I came here to call on a customer,
but they gave me a hard time
'cause I'm a girl.
Is that how
you think of yourself?
- As a sales rep?
- As a girl.
- Yeah, I don't have a problem with it.
- I like your hair.
- I like your outfit.
- Actually, this is
my second favorite outfit.
I had a first favorite, but it got
ruined and I had to get rid of it.
- You did?
- It smelled.
- Really? Having it
cleaned didn't help?
- No.
So tell me, Gary,
what do you do for a living?
- How far do you want
to go with this?
- Don't say anything yet.
I don't think it works
if we're somebody else.
I mean, Gary and Celeste,
what do they know about anything?
- Well, this is your game,
I've never played before.
- It's not a game.
It's not something you play.
Well, does this make
any sense to you?
It doesn't have to.
It's something that happens.
It's like seeing
someone for the first time...
like you could be passing on the street,
and you look at each other
and for a few seconds...
there's this kind of a recognition...
like you both know something.
The next moment,
the person's gone,
and it's too late
to do anything about it.
And you always remember it,
because it was there, and you let it go,
and you think to yourself,
"What if I had stopped?
If I had said something?"
"What if?"
"What if?"
And it may only happen
a few times in your life.
- Or once.
- Or once.
How'd you find me?
Uh...
Called your room
from downstairs.
Oh.
And if I had answered,
what were you gonna say?
I would say who I was,
and do you remember me,
and want to meet for a drink?
If I remembered you.
I came here looking for you.
All right, so then I would have
said yes, but for all you know,
I could have had a SWAT team waiting
for you... why would you trust me?
It'd be worth the risk.
- You like taking risks.
- So do you.
You know, sooner or later...
You really wear that suit.
Well, that's not
what you were about to say.
- Remember how talkative
you were in the trunk?
- Mm-hmm.
- Adele said you do that
when you're nervous.
- Oh, she did, did she?
- You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
- But in a nice way.
You know, that Sig
you took from me was special.
My dad gave it to me
for my birthday.
Yeah?
What were you going
to do with me?
I hadn't really worked
that part out yet.
All I knew is that I liked you,
and that I didn't wanna...
leave you there on the side of the road
and never see you again.
Then you waved to me
in that elevator.
- Yeah, I wasn't sure if you caught that.
-
I couldn't believe it.
By that time I had been...
thinking about you a lot...
and just wondering
what it would be like if we met,
if we could take a time-out.
I was thinking the same thing.
I kept thinking,
"What if we took a time-out?"
If we... just spent
some time together.
- You know, I saw you on the street.
- Where?
Outside Adele's.
- You went to see her?
- To warn her about Chino.
- So she did help you.
- I don't think we should get into that.
You're right.
And I won't ask about Buddy,
or what you guys are doing
in Detroit, or if you've run
into Glenn Michaels yet...
Okay, now, don't talk like that,
because you scare me.
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.
There's something
I want you to know.
I wasn't just looking for a fuck,
if that's what you're thinking.
- Or, I was...
- Why are you mad?
I was looking for some kinky thrill...
you know, score with the bank robber.
- The way some women go for rough trade...
- All right.
Now I can say that I fucked
a U.S. Marshal. Do you think I will?
I don't know.
Mm-hmm.
Come here.
I know a guy...
walks into a bank with a bottle,
tells everybody it's nitroglycerine.
He scores some cash
off of the teller.
On his way out, he drops the bottle.
It cracks on the floor.
He slips in it. He smacks up
his head. They get him.
The nitroglycerine
was canola oil.
I know more fucked-up bank robbers
than ones that know what they're doing.
I doubt one in ten could tell you
where the dye pack is.
Most bank robbers
are fucking morons.
For you to go to bed with one
for kinky thrills,
like you were saying,
makes you as dumb as they are.
Now, you are not dumb.
Why would you think that? Why would
you think that I would think that?
You're not dumb.
Well, I don't know about that.
I mean, you can't do three falls
and think you have much of a brain.
Come here.
You're getting
serious on me now.
Tryin' not to.
I just want to know
what's gonna happen.
You know.
Put it together now. Put it together!
Upstairs and downstairs.
- He don't want
to see you downstairs!
- Man, you drink like a bitch!
He don't want to see you... Get your
tussle on. Joe, get your tussle on!
Yeah, don't let him
out that corner.
Don't let him out, now.
Hey, you know what?
I gotta go take a pee.
What are you tellin' us for?
You want somebody to hold your pecker?
Do that work, Joe!
Put it together now, Joe!
That's it, baby!
Take him deep!
Oh, oh, my God, I love it.
Put him to sleep, Joe!
Put him to sleep, Joe!
Sit down, Kenny.
That's it! That's it!
- You tryin' to steal this car, Glenn?
- Don't, don't, don't!
Oh, my God,
I can't believe this!
Another one of those days, huh?
Nothing seems to be going right.
- I don't have the keys to the car.
- I see that.
No, I mean I am not
fucking stealing the car!
- You're not?
- No, I already stole it a week ago,
whenever it was,
in West Palm.
So I can't be
stealing it again, can I?
- Put your hands on the wheel, please.
- Okay, so now you're gonna...
bust me for pickin' up
a car, what the...
For the car, for aiding
and abetting a prison escape,
and for conspiring to do
whatever you came here for.
Listen to me. These guys, they're gonna
be out here any minute looking for me,
and they're
fucking animals, man.
What's going on, Glenn?
Nothing. I just wanna
get the fuck outta here.
I thought this whole thing
was your idea.
Okay, ripping off Ripley
was my idea,
but these guys, they are
in a whole other level of their own.
- Ripley, the Wall Street guy?
- Yeah, the plan was...
to pick him up
at his office tomorrow...
and drive him out
to his house in Bloomfield Hills.
And now I don't give a shit
what the guys do, you know?
- And Foley was part of this.
- Yeah, he's supposed to be,
but he hasn't showed up yet,
- which is good for him.
- Why?
Because Maurice is
gonna kill him.
Like, try to collect
the reward money or something.
But you say he hasn't shown up yet.
You think he backed out?
I don't know.
He doesn't exactly confide in me.
I wonder why.
Okay, if you're gonna do this,
let's do it and get out of here.
I am freezing
my ass off!
If you wanna get out of here, run.
It'll warm you up.
Oh, ha, ha.
Really?
I swear to God, Glenn, if I find out
that you are lying to me, l...
I know, you will find me.
I believe it.
Hey, know what
I was thinkin'?
If you didn't drive me
to the federal court last summer,
you wouldn't even
know who I am.
If I didn't know you, Glenn,
by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.
Think of it that way.
Now run.
Yeah! Yeah!
I'm tellin' you,
man, the money is here.
- Snoop.
- Hey, it's the bank robbers.
Y'all missin' the fights, man.
Pull up a chair.
- Who's sittin' here?
- Oh, that's your homey, Glenn, man.
But he bounced to the bathroom
a couple minutes ago...
- and we ain't seen him since.
- Must've fell in, man.
No doubt.
Yeah, sent these two looking for him.
They came back shaking their heads.
Well, if he left his coat
and he's been gone a while, then...
- Car's here, man. I checked.
- Yeah.
- All right. We're leavin'.
- Leavin'?
- What the fuck, Foley?
- Stupid, you know where Glenn is.
- Look, what you worried
about Glenn for, what he know?
- I thought everything.
No, Glenn know everything
that's supposed to happen tomorrow.
Now, he may run and tell somebody that,
but that don't mean shit.
Glenn don't know
I changed the plan.
It's happenin' tonight.
Soon as we leave here.
Go back by the house, pick up some shit
we gonna need, and we just gonna do it.
- Give me a minute to talk to Buddy.
- You got two minutes, that's all.
- Make up your mind, Foley.
- I wasn't asking permission.
- You know they're gonna set us up.
- I get that feeling, yeah.
You think you can get
to the diamonds before they do?
I'll make you a deal.
You get outta here right now.
I'll do the job with Snoop. I'll meet
you anywhere you want, give you half.
- Half for doin' what?
- Gettin' me out of Glades, for starters.
Who's gonna watch
your back?
All right, White Boy.
House call.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Ready to do this, baby?
- Ready for whatever.
Cool. My shit always work.
Perennial Plumbing.
Somebody in the house called.
You don't know what you're talking
about, because no one was here.
- Let's go skiing.
-  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You still got time
to take me up on my offer.
And leave you alone
with these assholes?
- Raymond Cruz.
- Ray, it's Karen Sisco.
I'm at Ripley's house.
I just saw Maurice Miller and four other
suspects force their way into the house.
They're armed.
I'm gonna need backup.
- Who are you?
- I work here.
I'm the maid. Fuck off!
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do:
Fuck you, then off you.
- Hey, not yet.
- Where Ripley at?
- He isn't here.
- Out for the evening or some shit?
- He's in Florida... Palm Beach.
- When's he due back?
- What difference does it make?
You gonna wait for him?
Mr. Ripley's down for the season.
Christmas to Easter.
Stop that shit, man.
You're here all by yourself?
That's right. Just me.
- Where Ripley's safe at,
keeps his valuables in?
- I don't have any idea.
I fuckin' bet you don't.
We gonna take a look upstairs
in the man's bedroom, all right?
You and Mr. Buddy look
at all the rooms down here.
Check the paintings,
behind the walls.
Check the fuckin' walls
in the closets. The man's
got a safe. It's here somewhere.
What about his place
down in Florida?
If you called, we could have checked
the walls down there before we left.
That is, if you'd bothered to find out
where he was. You follow me?
Man, take this bitch upstairs.
Upstairs!
Listen, you try and trip any alarms,
anything like that,
you gonna be a dead Hazel,
you understand me?
- Hey, hey, where we at? Where is it?
- Over there.
- Ever wear one of these?
- I don't ski.
Keep an eye on the maid.
I'll have a look around.
Go sit down. Please.
Damn, Mo. How's this motherfucker
livin', man? Shit!
Check behind the pictures
on the walls, man.
Hey, Mo. Found some rubbers.
White Boy, why the fuck
you lookin' under the mattress?
You know dude ain't gonna hide
no diamonds under there.
Damn! Dumb 'bama motherfucker.
- Where Foley at, man?
- He's checkin' the other rooms
like you said, boss.
Man, keep a eye on Foley.
Ken, stop fuckin'
with the radio, put on a CD.
- I don't recognize
none of these bands, Mo.
- Just pick somebody.
What, "How To Sing
Like Michael Bolton"?
What the fuck you wanna
listen to, huh?
- I like Schubert.
- Schubert? Well, I don't.
Uh, Foley?
Cool.
- Foley!
- How you doin'?
What in God's name
is happening here?
- Who's upstairs?
- Snoopy Miller, couple of his friends.
- Maurice, from Lompoc?
- Yup.
Have they got Midge up there?
What kind of a man lets a woman
answer the door this time of night?
We thought it was her husband.
He comes here and checks up on her.
I'm supposed to be
down in Florida.
In a few minutes, you're gonna
wish you were. Let's go, come on.
Why don't you sit down?
We'll have a look at your fish.
Oh, that's workin'.
That's workin'.
Motherfucker!
I found the safe, yo!
Don't go nowhere.
- Oh, shit! We gonna have a party!
- Look at that bitch.
They found the safe.
- Fuck.
- Buddy, you remember
Richard, don't you?
- Yeah, hi. Nice house.
- Thank you.
Yeah, man.
We just all hit this handle,
blow this sucker
wide open, man.
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's get ready.
Oh, Dude... you're gonna
kill me with that.
- Where you been, man?
- Found some steaks.
- Steaks?
- Yeah, some big ones, bro.
Man, come on.
Blast this damn safe open, man.
- He's down there lookin' for food.
- Fool.
All right. Hold it. No.
Get to the side, man. All right.
On three.
One, two, three.
- Jesus Christ, they're shooting Midge!
- Sit down, Dick.
They're trying to open up
the safe, not your maid.
Oh, shit.
Man, we didn't even crack
this sum' bitch.
- Okay, hit the hinges.
- Uh-huh.
Put your finger in your ear, man.
This is gonna be loud.
All right, on three. One, two...
The combination is 3-10-44.
- Richard's birthday.
- Thank you.
Are they dead?
We gotta find Foley, man.
Can't believe you're still angry with me
after all this time.
I'm not angry with you, Richard.
In fact, I'm completely relaxed.
The thing is, I can't figure if
it's the fish that are cooling me out,
or all those uncut diamonds
in the bottom of the tank, there.
Goddamn.
Dumb-fuck Glenn was right.
You got about 5 million worth in there?
Five point two.
They just look
like plain ol' rocks!
They sure do.
You wanna grab 'em, Buddy?
If I were you,
I'd get up and run.
- I'm not leaving Midge.
- Don't be an asshole.
They're gonna kill you.
Well, if that's my fate then so be it,
but I'm not leaving her.
I'm in love with her.
- Come on, Jack.
- Good luck, Richard.
- Come on, Jack.
- Shit. They're gonna rape
that maid, aren't they?
By the look of those guys,
they'll rip her too.
- Then they're gonna kill 'em.
- At least.
Rip, Rip.
- Tricky motherfucker.
- Are those my suits?
Naw. These are my suits.
Look at you, man.
Where you been hidin', Dick?
We made it, didn't we?
- All you gotta do is
get in the van, baby.
- I'm goin' back in.
- I'm goin' with you.
- No, you dump the van,
meet me at the airport.
- I'll get one of Ripley's cars.
- Jack...
The shit that's about to go
down here, you'll be on the phone
with your sister for a month.
- All I'm sayin' is we're square.
- Here.
Yep.
Jack.
Get outta here.
- Get that shit off.
-  Get your hands off me!
- Fuck you, shut up!
Nobody's gonna help you.
-
- Midge!
- Fuck Midge, man.
Where the jewels at, Dick?
- Foley... Foley's got them.
Go after Foley!
- Where the fuck is Foley, man?
Midge?
Midge! -
- Sit your punk ass down, man.
- Ooh, goddamn!
- Son of a bitch!
Man, take the front stairs.
I'm gonna take the back.
- You all right?
- Where's Richard?
He's downstairs.
You wait here.
Hold it, asshole.
Drop the gun.
Drop it!
Put the damn gun down, now.
Now!
Put it down!
Stay right there.
Don't move. Maurice!
I got Foley!
Maurice!
Ain't got
another clip I can use, do you?
No, I don't.
- You ain't never shot
a gun before, have you?
- Not until recently, no.
- You a little nervous?
- Little bit, yeah.
You know, a situation like this
has a high potentiality...
for the common motherfucker
to bitch out.
- So I figure, why take a chance?
-
Bitch!
- Aw, sh...!
- Motherfucker!
Stop! Put your hands in the air!
Jack?
- I know you're up there.
- Shit!
- Where's Kenneth?
- He's up here.
He's dead.
- Come on, Jack, don't.
- Pretend it's not me.
- You think I'd shoot you?
- If you don't, somebody else will.
What're you now?
A desperado?
- Put the gun down.
- I'm not goin' back.
Jack, please, don't make me do this.
Put the gun down.
- Damn it, Jack, put the gun down!
-
No more time-outs.
You win, Jack.
- I can't shoot you.
- You did. You shot me.
You know what I mean.
I'm sorry.
I wish things were different.
Airport.
Yeah, they don't know
yet if they want to bring him up
on the homicides.
I doubt if they will.
They'll just put a detainer on him.
When they're through with him here,
he'll go back to Florida.
Are you gonna go get him?
It's possible. Why?
Well, you know,
I was just thinkin'.
You can have a nice time
with him on the ride down,
picking up where your interlude
or whatever you call it left off,
and then you can throw him
in the shithouse.
He knew what he was doing.
Nobody forced him to rob banks.
My little girl... the tough babe.
I'll call you later.
Good-bye.
Jack.
I got you a present.
Something for the road.
I'm gonna have to take it away,
though, soon as the ride is over.
Jack Foley?
Meet Hijirah Henry.
What kind of a name is Hijirah?
- It's Islamic.
- What's it stand for?
The "Hijirah" was Mohammed's
flight from Mecca in 622.
- His flight?
- Brothers in Leavenworth
gave me that name.
You were in Leavenworth, huh?
- Four time.
- Meaning?
- Meaning, time came, I left.
- You busted out.
I prefer to think of it as an exodus
from an undesirable place.
- How long before they
caught up with you?
- That time?
- There were others?
- Yeah. That was the ninth.
The ninth?
Well, ten if you count that prison
hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
- You done a lot of walkin', Henry.
- Hijirah.
Hijirah.
Now we're off to Glades.
Yeah, it looks that way.
I was supposed to leave
last night with the lady marshal,
but for some reason
she wanted to wait.
- She did, huh?
- Guess it's cheaper taking
two of us down in one van.
Could be. Maybe she thought
