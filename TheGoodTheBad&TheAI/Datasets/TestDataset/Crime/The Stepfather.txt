DETECTIVE TYLAR: One female
in her late thirties
and three minors.
Multiple stab wounds
and blunt-force trauma.
CAPTAIN MACKIE: What about
the ex-husband?
Court said the wife
had a restraining order
against him.
Dylan Bennet.
He spent the night with
a bottle of Jack Daniel's.
lt was his
first Christmas
without his family.
MACKIE: All the more reason.
TYLAR: Well
you didn't se'e him
when he ID-ed his family.
Looked like he'd been
hit by a freight train.
DETECTIVE SHAY:
Seeing his kids like that.
All the blood.
Yeah, it was definitely
a nightmare for him.
TYLAR: If this guy did it,
he gets my vote for
a goddamn Academy Award.
Let's say the stepfather,
this Grady Edwards did it.
What do we got on him?
Nothing.
Said he was from Kansas.
SHAY: Except we can't find
a match in any database.
And he stopped the newspaper
to have time to disappear.
And we think he might
have done this before.
Three years ago
in New Jersey,
a wife and three kids.
Gunshot wounds to
the back of the head.
The stepfather disappeared.
Lived in a rented room
where he met the victims.
Both rooms were owned
by older women.
One of the women
who lives in New Jersey said,
''He's a wondeful man,
always paid his rent
on time and in cash.''
So, of course,
she never asked him
for any identification.
SHAY: No, he's smart.
The Toyota Land Cruiser
that we found abandoned?
Paid for in cash.
No driver's license
required for registration.
TYLAR: No credit cards,
no anything. Which means...
MACKIE: No photo ID required.
SHAY: Always a divorced
or widowed situation.
TYLAR: l'm telling you,
this guy's a monster.
Even if this is your guy,
it's been six months.
He could be anywhere by now.
SEAN: Mom, Beth says
l can't get these.
Sean, we're not
getting these.
Hey! You two stop arguing.
Why does she always get
to pick the kind of cookies
we get? It's not fair!
Life is not fair.
Life is about the woman
getting to pick the cookies.
Sorry, they get a little
out of control sometimes.
They're just kids.
But the sooner you figure out
the cookie deal, the easier
your life's gonna be.
l'm just saying.
lt's a woman's world
and we're just guests here.
Wise man. l'd say
your wife is very lucky.
Oh. Uh, l'm not
married anymore.
l still wear it, but l
Iost my wife and daughter
in an accident last year.
Drunk driver.
Oh, God, l'm so sorry.
lt's okay.
l could use
a little help, though.
Sure.
Where is the peanut butter?
l just moved to Portland
and l don't know
this store yet.
lt's actually
two aisles over.
This way? Thank you.
Uh-huh.
You're so welcome.
Remember what
l told you.
What?
lf l didn't know better,
l'd think you were
following me.
No. Hey.
Um...
l'm not usually this forward,
but l'm recently divorced
and, um...
l'm taking my kids for pizza,
so l thought maybe
you might want to go.
Pizza?
The truth is,
l'm just dying for
some adult conversation.
Well, l'm not usually
this easy.
David Harris.
Susan. Susan Harding.
lt's very nice to meet you.
lt's nice to meet you.
¶ Now l've lived through
my share of misfortune
l still can't believe
she didn't come to
the airport.
l told you, she had
some things to do.
¶ But how long
should it take somebody
A little help here.
Yeah.
¶ Before they can
be someone? ¶
At least you have me.
So, have you met this guy?
Yeah, a couple of times.
You know, when l came by
to say hi to your mom.
He seems cool.
Okay, but she's
only known him since,
what, like,
after Christmas?
That's so fast.
Well...
Come on, give it
a chance. You know?
Before you do
something stupid.
Like what?
l don't know. Like, um,
irritating your mom
and getting sent
back to military school.
l'm just saying, it seems like
she's rushing into things.
Don't you think?
l think it's her
business what she does
with her personal life.
And she tends to
screw that up, mostly.
Come on, Michael,
chill on this one, please?
No fights with your mom.
Okay.
Okay. l got something
to show you.
ALL: Surprise!
Well, this is a surprise.
This is a surprise.
Thank you.
l'm so happy to have you home.
SEAN: Hey, Michael.
What's up?
Hey. Sean.
Holy crap, you're huge.
Thanks.
l missed you. Come here.
Beth. l missed you, too.
Welcome home.
Hey, Aunt Jackie.
Leah, hey.
Hi, sweetie.
Let me look at you.
Your hair's gotten longer.
Yeah. They ease up
on you after a year.
You look so...
So much like a man.
l was expecting a boy.
That's what the military does.
Builds men. Good, strong men.
Michael, this is David.
David, Michael.
ls that a regulation cut?
No.
lt wasn't real military.
It was just a school
for screwups.
Oh.
Well
good to finally meet you.
l've heard so much about you.
Everything seems
to be going great.
Sean and Beth love him.
What's not to love?
Yeah, he's almost
too good to be true.
Don't start, Jackie.
l'm kidding.
l'm kidding.
l like him.
Do you think l'm
crazy to be engaged
to someone l've only
known for six months?
You've always been crazy.
That has nothing
to do with him.
He seems a little crazy,
too, about you.
DAVID: Everyone have
enough to eat?
ALL: Yeah...
l would like to
propose a toast.
First of all
l want to th' ank Susan
and Sean and Beth,
who, in a very short time,
have taken me in
and made me feel at home.
This is... It's a dream
come true for me.
Thank you.
And to Michael.
Your return makes
us complete.
Family is
the most important thing.
Without it, we have nothing.
Welcome home, Michael.
Hear, hear.
MAN: Hear, hear, Michael.
l think l'm a little
nauseous after that.
Stop it.
You want something
to drink?
No, no, no, l got this.
We have a surprise
for you, too.
Really?
Jackie pulled a few strings
and she can get you a job
working with her as
a real estate agent.
Oh, l couldn't.
Wait a minute.
Of course you can.
Okay? Just follow me around
and I'll get you all set up.
lt's a great
opportunity for us
and she really
went out of her way.
Well, l can't say no
to my bride-to-be
or her sister, can l?
Thank you, Jackie.
Don't thank me. Thank her.
Because she's
the one who convinced me
to get you off the road
so she can keep
an eye on you.
Oh. Did you?
Thank you.
l'm gonna go have
a word with your son.
God, l hope Michael
takes to him.
He will. He's just been
blindsided by the divorce.
He'll bounce back.
Michael.
Give me four minutes.
Meet me in the basement.
So, what'd he say?
He said he wants me to
meet him in the basement.
ln the basement?
Yeah.
Why?
l don't know.
Well, l guess l'm
about to find out.
Those two are mine.
But you're welcome
to use the others.
What's all this for?
Well, l'm a bit of
a wannabe carpenter.
l built these
storage cabinets myself.
And l'm working up
in the attic right now
on some termite damage.
l think we need
a real toast.
Just the guys.
This is where
l keep the good stuff.
There we go.
Now, don't let your mom know
l've got a tequila stash.
l've worked my ass off
trying to convince her
l'm perfect.
l know this must
be a bit of a shock,
your mom and me
getting married and all,
but l want you
to know, l want us
to be a real family.
Because without it,
we have nothing?
Oh.
Okay. Touché.
So l get a little
corny sometimes,
but l meant what l said.
You just let me
handle your mother,
and l'm gonna make
sure you stay right here,
where you belong.
No more military school.
We're gonna put this
family back together,
you and me,
father and son.
Stepfather.
Stepfather
and son.
That's smooth, isn't it?
So your mother tells me
you're one hell of a swimmer.
Yeah, l do okay.
You know, l used to
swim in competition.
In college, at U of O.
Your senior year is
gonna be very important.
You could maybe get
a college scholarship
swimming.
You should be
training this summer.
lt's kind of hard to
train in a backyard pool.
Maybe. But l hear
your old school has
a summer swim program.
lt does, but l can't
use that pool anymore.
That's the past.
Here is to the future.
Remember,
l have to go see my
grandparents tomorrow.
Yeah, that's right.
But l'll be back
the day after. l'm sorry.
No, that's all right.
l mean, it's the day
l get back,
but that's fine.
l'll call someone else.
Shut up. l'm sorry.
Listen, l want to
get my license.
So, can you take me
by the DMV?
Maybe.
l'll think about it.
Why not?
l kind of like having you
dependent on me, actually.
All right, get in the car.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night, Leah.
Bye.
Glad you're home, Michael.
Thanks, Aunt Jackie.
l'm so glad to be home.
Thank you for coming.
KELLY: Do you think
David meant what he said
about getting your
mom to let you stay?
He said he was
gonna make it happen,
so we'll see.
Sweet. Bye.
A lot for one day, huh?
No, no, it was...
It was nice. Thanks.
l'm trying too hard.
You can say it.
Look, Michael, l know
it's difficult to come home
to another man in the house.
l just need you to
try and get along, okay?
Mom, can we just hold
the lectures, please?
l've been home
for two seconds.
Okay.
He's a really good guy.
And he cares about me
and we're trying to
start a new life together.
And you don't want
me to mess that up.
Well, that's not fair.
No, no, no, l get it.
l'll try not to inconvenience
you and your new life.
Michael.
l'm sorry. l, um...
l'm pretty tired, Mom.
Okay. Okay.
Good night.
SUSAN: Maybe he should
stay there his senior year.
But his place is
here with his family.
Yeah, but you don't
know what he was like.
The kids he was
hanging out with,
the lying.
His temper was
out of control.
Believe me,
l want him here more than
anything in the world.
l just hope he's ready.
You're right.
Are you ready?
Well, it depends.
Are you ready for it?
¶ The same sick place
that we keep falling on
¶ The safest place
is here in my head
¶ It's where l get lost ¶
Wow, that smells good.
Hey.
How was work?
Work was great.
These are for you.
Thank you.
Michael.
What's this?
Your locker key
to the boys' gym
at your old high school.
The swim team
starts training
first week in July.
Wait, how did you
swing this?
l had a little chat
with Mrs. Rivers,
the athletic director,
a very open-minded woman.
David, that was so sweet.
Yeah, that's incredible.
lt's just a probationary
period for now.
There's no guarantee
they'll let you back
in the fall.
But we'll work on that later.
lt means a lot.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
So, what are we
having here?
Okay, l just think it's so
cool that he actually did
what he said he was gonna do.
l know. l know.
See, l told you everything
was gonna work out.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Hey, we still going
to the DMV tomorrow?
Um. Yeah.
l'll be by around 10:00.
Yeah, that sounds good.
All right.
Good night.
Night.
¶ l'm happy to say
¶ It's really not
too bad a day out... ¶
Hey, Sean,
turn that down, please!
Yes!
Sean, turn that down now!
l mean it!
Your mother said
to turn it down!
¶ Do you know why? ¶
Do you think it's a good idea
they're so passionate
at their age?
They've known each other
since grade school.
She's a good influence
on Michael.
You should stop being
so old-fashioned.
l think it's so lucky
that your mom met David.
Why is that?
He is gonna be your ticket
to staying here with me.
Maybe l don't want
to stay here with you.
Maybe you want to go
back to an all-boys
military school.
Maybe.
Mmm-hmm.
But l like
Iooking at you.
That's why we
make a good couple.
Because l like
you looking at me.
SUSAN: You okay, Sean?
Um...
Yeah, l'm okay.
You sure, buddy?
This is great.
l've missed family
dinners like this.
You've missed them?
Does that mean you
were married before?
David lost his
wife and daughter
in an accident.
BETH: Yeah,
a drunk driver.
Oh.
l had no idea.
l'm sorry, David.
l'm sorry.
l guess that's why family
is so important to me,
Michael.
SUSAN: Well
family is imp!ortant.
We haven't always had
such great experiences
as a family.
Hey, it wasn't all
Dad's fault.
No, l didn't say it was.
BETH: But, you know,
our family wasn't that bad.
l saw on TV this woman who
drove off a bridge with her
three kids in the back seat.
That is so not
dinner-table conversation,
young lady.
They all drowned.
That kind of thing
really gets to me,
that someone
could do that to
her own children.
lt makes you wonder,
though, what it takes
to make someone do
something so sick.
Okay. Can we change
the conversation?
Yeah, l'm sorry.
Dad!
Maybe they disappointed her.
Dad!
Hey, how are you?
Let me take this.
l'm good. Thanks.
Hey, sweetie.
Hi, Dad.
Aren't you gonna
say hello to him?
No.
BETH: Shotgun!
What?
SEAN: There's no way
you're getting shotgun.
Hey. Hey, work it out,
guys. Work it out.
Hey.
Back on Sunday.
They're going to camp.
We have a million
things to do.
l know they're
going to camp.
l'm only in town
a couple days.
l'm taking the kids
to a Blazers game.
They can spend the night
with me at the hotel.
l'll have them back tomorrow.
Where's the co-ed girlfriend?
That's over.
Actually, she was
working for a Ph.D.
She wasn't that much
younger than you were.
She just took a little
better care of herself,
that's all.
ls Michael home?
He doesn't want to see you.
Those his words or yours?
His.
''Your check is
Iate'' are mine.
Just make sure you don't
spend any of the money
on my replacement in there.
lt's not necessary
to replace you, Jay.
You're not missed.
Good to see you,
too, Susan.
You guys ready?
Everything okay?
He's just always
such an ass.
So, Michael, Jackie has me
covering an open house
in the afternoon,
but let's you and me
have lunch tomorrow.
What do you say?
That'd be really nice.
Yeah, that'd be good.
Great.
Hey, Mrs. Cutter,
how are you?
l'm fine, Susan.
There was
a police sketch...
SUSAN: l can assure you
it's not David.
Don't worry.
It's so not him.
Okay. If you see it,
come over and
Iet's talk about it.
Okay.
Thanks, Mrs. Cutter.
All right.
You all right?
Yeah.
That was Mrs. Cutter.
She's known in
the neighborhood
as ''The Cat Lady.''
Stopped by with one
of her gazillion cats.
They make my
allergies go crazy.
What'd she want?
Wanted to tell me
that she had seen
this story on
America's Most Wanted
about this killer
and that the police sketch
Iooked just like you.
lt was all l could do
not to laugh in her face.
You know Erica Harmon, right?
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, so a couple years ago,
she tells Erica Harmon's
husband
that Erica is having an affair
because she sees this man
sneaking into their house
every morning
just after he leaves.
And was she?
Well, yeah.
Well, there you go, then.
Well, it wasn't
any of her business
and she told
the entire neighborhood
before she told him.
Great. This'll make me
a hit with the neighbors, huh?
l gotta go.
l think l'd rather be
the mystery man sneaking
into Mrs. Harmon's house.
What's she look like?
Stop it.
Hey, where are you
having lunch?
Because l need to
drop Michael off.
There's a diner
across from the office
and l'll bring him home
on my way to the open house.
Have a great day.
Hey, Mom.
Hey, sleepyhead.
Want something to eat?
Yes, please.
Okay.
Where's David?
You just missed him.
Good morning, Mrs. Cutter.
Okay, anybody got
a sweet tooth?
Do you want dessert?
No, no.
You sure?
Some more tea? Anything?
No. No, l'm fine.
All right.
Just the check, please.
No problem.
Thank you for lunch,
by the way.
Absolutely. So...
What l really wanted to
talk to you about was, um...
Well, l need a favor.
Well, what kind of favor?
l'd like you to
be my best man.
Me?
l'd really be
honored if you would.
There's no one else
l'd rather have.
l know sometimes l get
a little carried away
with the whole family thing,
but, you know, truth is,
l'm really happy you're home.
And like l said,
l'm gonna make sure
you stay home
and this family
stays complete. Right?
Here you go.
Thank you.
So, uh,
what do you say?
Well...
l know it would make
your mother very happy.
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
That's great. That is great!
You know, without sounding
too sentimental,
l want to tell you,
meeting your mother
that day in the supermarket
changed my life.
lt was hard, you know,
after what happened
to my wife and daughter.
Mmm-hmm.
My little Michelle
was my whole world,
my whole life.
Watching her grow
up was everything.
You'll understand
what l'm talking about when
you have kids of your own.
Not that you and Kelly
should be rushing into
anything. Okay?
No, no, no. Don't worry.
You got years to
go if you're smart.
When it happens,
l think you'll
see what l mean.
They're everything.
Lisa would have
turned 11 next week.
Who's Lisa?
My daughter.
Thanks.
Pleasure.
l'm sorry.
l thought you said
her name was Michelle.
Did l?
Mmm-hmm.
lt's Lisa-Michelle.
You must have heard it wrong.
l'm sorry.
Yeah. 11 next week.
Damn it!
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
Hi!
Hi!
Hello, there.
We're the Baldwins.
We called about the house.
Mrs. Baldwin. Mr. Baldwin.
Good to meet you.
l'm David Harris.
Mrs. Baldwin,
do you have any children?
Three girls.
Three girls?
You're gonna
Iove this place.
Stay here.
Finish your dinner.
Okay. l'm coming.
All right. Yeah.
Come on. Come on, baby.
Come on.
Yeah. Let's see who it is.
Midnight? Midnight?
Where is that cat?
Where is he? Midnight?
Where is that Midnight?
Come here.
What are you doing?
What's the matter?
KELLY: So, are you?
Am l what?
Gonna be his best man.
Um...
Yeah. Yeah, l guess.
l said yes, so...
KELLY: What?
l'm about to get
another father.
You know,
and l can't talk to
the one l have now.
Well, maybe
you should start.
¶ You want the truth
¶ l don't know what's real
¶ You found me out
¶ l'm still nipping
at your heels
¶ l could try
¶ But the feeling
won't let go ¶
What's wrong?
Didn't you close your door?
Yeah.
Beth? Is that you?
Sean? Sean?
No, there's no one here.
What?
Jesus, David.
Hey, come on.
Where you going?
l better go home.
You don't have to leave.
No, it's okay.
Were you just watching us?
Doing what?
l just got home from work.
l'm gonna take a shower
and get ready for dinner.
SUSAN: You and Kelly
have been together
for a long time.
All l'm saying is,
l just want you
to be careful.
She seems like
a very nice young woman.
Which is why a young man
should be more discreet
with his affections.
Meaning what?
What does that mean?
People might get
the wrong idea about her.
You wouldn't want that,
now, would you?
What do you suppose
people think about you
moving in with my mother?
Michael.
Excuse me. Apologize.
No. For what?
Being disrespectful.
lt's okay. It's okay.
It's healthy to have
open family dialogue, right?
Yeah.
SUSAN: How was your day?
lt was busy.
Was Mrs. Cutter
here today?
No. It's probably from
the house l was showing.
They have cats and...
Sean. Beth...
Hey. If you ever lay a hand on
one of my kids again, it'll be
the last thing you ever do!
What are you
talking about?
This bastard
tried to choke Sean.
l didn't choke anybody.
Sean says you put your hand
around his neck and it hurt.
His mother told him to
turn down his video game and
he wasn't listening to her.
l was just
trying to show him
a little discipline.
From what l've seen,
that's lacking
a bit in this family.
lf you ever touch
my family again,
l will kill you!
l swear to God!
SUSAN: Stop it.
Come on...
This is not your
family anymore, Jay.
What do you even
know about this guy?
Stop.
What do you know about him?
Stop it!
l know he's not sleeping
with his secretary!
You don't know
a goddamn thing!
l'll call the police
if you don't leave!
Not a goddamn thing!
You heard what l said.
You touch my kids again,
you got some big
trouble coming.
Oh, my God.
l'm so sorry.
lt's okay. Come here.
l'm so sorry.
He had no goddamn right
grabbing Sean like that.
No goddamn right!
You can't do this anymore!
Come on. Calm down, please.
Dad, here.
You dropped this.
It fell out of your pocket
when you were going at it.
Thanks.
You stopped me
from doing something
really dumb in there.
Yeah, l probably did.
l don't like this guy.
l don't trust him.
l mean, what do you
know about this guy?
Not any more
than you, really.
You got taller.
Yeah, well, you know,
it's been a year.
Hey, hey, come on.
Talk to me for a second,
will you?
What do you want?
l don't know.
l want to talk to you.
Your mom says you
don't want to see me.
ls that true?
l don't know, Dad.
You know, l'm not
the one who left.
l left your mom.
l didn't leave you.
You kids are
the most important thing
in the world to me.
Well, yeah, yeah,
you have a funny way
of showing that.
Hey, l know. l screwed up.
l feel really bad
about that, but l'd
like to make it up to you.
What, you're not gonna see me?
You're not gonna talk to me?
No.
Are you okay, Sean?
Yeah.
l guess l shouldn't
have told Dad.
Well, what...
No, it wasn't
your fault, Sean.
l shouldn't have
done what l did.
It wasn't right.
l'm not your father.
Maybe someday, but...
This is all new to me again.
l'm gonna make mistakes.
And l just hope you can
forgive me when l do.
Can you do that?
l promise,
it'll never happen
again, okay?
Friends?
Friends.
Yeah. All right.
l shouldn't have done it.
lt's just that
l see a family without
a father and l know
how easy it can
all fall apart.
lf l'm ever gonna
be a part of you,
l need to gain their respect.
And trust.
l don't know how you
were raised, David,
but my family never
used physical force.
lt's not okay with me.
Sure.
You're right.
DAVID: l can't keep...
l can't... l can't...
l got to make this work...
lt's all right.
It's all right.
l'll tell her l'm sorry.
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
It's just...
Thanks.
David.
Yes. Something wrong?
No. No, in fact,
everything's great.
Your enthusiasm with
the buyers at the Reeves'
open house made the sale.
Great.
We need these filled out.
What are they?
Social Security,
payroll insurance,
workman's comp.
And we need a picture ID.
Personnel said that they gave
you the forms to fill out,
but they just
never got them back.
No, no, l never got anything.
Don't worry about it.
We need them, though,
so we don't have
to keep paying you
under the table.
l'll get all this
done right away.
Great.
DAVID: It just wasn't
something l enjoyed doing,
that's all.
Well, l don't understand,
because Jackie said
you were a natural.
Real estate is just not me.
Well, what does that mean?
That you want to go back
on the road again?
l don't know.
We'll see. We'll see.
No, wait. l...
SUSAN: l thought you
enjoyed family. l mean,
dinners like...
l know how much you
hate me being gone,
but it's what l know best.
Let me get
on your computer
and look around.
Maybe l can find
something that doesn't
require much travel.
Dude,
you better turn it down.
Are you worried about David?
He's not gonna
touch you, all right?
l'll make sure.
l'm just useless.
Hey. l'm walking out
the door right now.
Okay, see you.
How's it going?
Couple of things
down in Eugene.
Okay, well, l'm gonna go meet
Jackie and Leah for a drink
and plan the wedding.
Would you like to come?
l don't think so.
When l'm done with this,
l'm gonna go for a run.
Okay.
David...
l didn't mean to
make such a fuss
about your work and all.
l don't want
you to do anything
you don't want to do.
l
want you to be
as happy as l am.
Have fun.
Susan's not here.
How about the kids?
Beth's at a friend's.
Sean and Michael are
upstairs playing video games.
Look, uh...
l'm sorry about
the other night.
l made an ass out of myself.
It's just when Susan
and l fight...
l was headed to the airport.
l wanted to say goodbye
to the kids and...
Well, l'd like to
apologize to you
for being a jerk.
Apology accepted.
Come on in and say goodbye.
Hey, Michael tells
me you used to swim
for the Ducks?
A long time ago.
Yeah? What year?
'92.
Really?
l went to U of O myself.
l got to grab that.
Excuse me.
Sure. Sure.
Hello.
Hey.
Jay had left a message
on my cell phone
saying he was gonna
stop by there to say
goodbye to the kids.
Did he come yet?
No. Not yet.
Okay, well, if he does,
will you just stay
out of the way?
All right.
l'll see you later then.
Hey, you want to
hear something funny?
l called the alumni office
and they told me
they only had four guys
named David Harris
graduate in
the last 30 years.
And two of them are dead
and one graduated in '87.
And the other one was that
All-American running back.
You remember him?
Of course, he's a little
darker than you are,
wouldn't you say?
So, uh...
lt's just...
It seems like you
might have lied to Michael
about college and swimming.
And now
it's got me wondering
just, you know,
what else you
might've lied about.
Hey, look, l told Michael
that l would do
some checking on you
and, to be honest,
l'd like some answers.
Hey. You hear me?
Yep.
What?
l heard something.
What was it?
l don't know.
It's nothing.
l don't understand.
l'm kind of confused,
because...
About?
Well, the feedback
from the buyers was great.
He just felt that
it wasn't what he
thought it was gonna be.
You're okay with
him on the road?
He's gonna try to find
something where he doesn't
have to travel that much.
And l just want
him to be happy.
If he's happy, l'm happy.
There you go.
l just want to get his bags.
Pop the trunk?
You got it.
This is Jay Harding.
Leave a message.
Hey, Dad. It's me.
Where are you?
Call me. Bye.
David!
Yeah, what do you
need, Michael?
Nothing.
You know when you asked me
at Michael's party
if l thought you were
rushing into things?
l'm thinking now
that maybe you are.
l mean, how much do you
really know about David?
The same day that l
ask him for details
about his past,
he just up and quits.
You don't find that strange?
No, l don't.
You know what l want to do?
l want to go to Vegas
and have one of those
Nice.
David wants to have
a church wedding.
That's great. What church?
l mean, do you even
know what religion he is?
l don't care what
goddamn religion he is.
Okay, you're starting
to sound just like Jay.
He's accused me of
not knowing anything
about David.
You know what l do know?
David has been good to me.
He's good to the kids.
They love him.
He's made my life
worth living again.
l mean, l...
For the first time
in a long time,
l'm looking forward
to the future with a smile.
l just wish everybody
would be happy for me.
ls that too much to ask?
No, it's not.
Personally, l'm with you.
Hey, l'd have my teeth
cleaned in Vegas if l could.
Right?
Go! Go! Go!
Watch it! Wow!
l just missed that car.
Hey, guys.
DAVID: Hey.
Hey, Mom.
How'd it go with
Jackie and Leah?
We decided we
should go to Vegas.
l'll be right back.
Where's Michael?
He's in his room.
l think he's a little upset
that his father never showed.
That is so typical of Jay.
Honey?
Yeah.
l have a confession to make.
l accidentally
broke the crystal vase
that was in the living room.
That's okay.
lt was a wedding
gift from Jay's sister.
l never liked it anyway.
You didn't?
Mmm-mmm.
Or her.
Then l don't feel so bad.
You don't think
it's a little weird
that l ask for some
background information,
and suddenly,
he doesn't want to sell
real estate anymore?
Not necessarily.
l like David.
He's a gentleman.
He always picks up the tab.
Jay was so cheap.
Do you know what l
do think is weird, though?
He always pays in cash.
Who doesn't
want the miles?
You know, l never thought
l would ever say this,
but l think l'm
gonna give Jay a call.
l mean, if he's not
buying this either,
then maybe it's
worth checking into.
Hey. He didn't show up?
No.
l'm so sorry.
That's okay.
No, it's not okay.
He's never been
there for you like
a father should be.
And part of that's my fault
because l never
should have allowed it
to go on as long as it did.
That's why David's
so important to me.
Because he cares
about you kids.
He wants you to be here
and be part of your lives.
He's so perfect, isn't he?
Take those off.
l thought you'd be
able to see how happy
David makes me.
He is part of
this family now.
l want him in my
life and our lives
and you need to
understand that.
Do you understand that,
Michael?
Yeah. l understand. Okay?
Okay.
David, are you down...
l'm just putting
some things away.
l'll be right up.
Okay.
Sorry l didn't make it.
Definitely next time.
But l did check out
your soon-to-be stepfather.
l still don't like him,
but at least
he seems to be
who he says he is.
lt was good seeing you,
Michael. Dad.
¶ Thank you for
¶ Making me
¶ Feel like
¶ l'm guilty
¶ Making it
¶ Easier to
¶ Murder your sweet memory ¶
Hey, Robert.
What happened over there?
Mrs. Cutter died.
She had an accident.
l guess her niece
called a couple of times.
Didn't hear
anything from her.
So she stopped by
the house and found her
just this morning.
That's sad.
Have a good one.
Mom? There's a bunch
of police cars
across the street.
SUSAN: What's going on?
The old woman
across the street?
She fell down her stairs
and broke her neck.
The one with the cats.
SUSAN: Mrs. Cutter?
Yeah.
That's horrible.
When did it happen?
The mailman said her niece
found her this morning.
That poor woman.
Sean. Hurry.
We got to go, honey.
All those things
l've said about her.
l feel terrible.
lt breaks my heart.
Will you remember
to pick them up
from the dentist?
Yeah, l will.
Okay, guys.
Bye.
See you.
l'll see you.
Hello.
David, it's Jackie.
Hey, Jackie. What's up?
l'm just calling
to remind you about
those forms.
l'm not working
there anymore.
l know.
lt's just, we still
need the state and
federal tax papers
and l'm leaving tomorrow.
l'm catching
a flight to meet Leah
in Hawaii for two weeks,
and so l'd really like to
get that paperwork in
before l leave.
l'm a bit crunched
for time today.
l have to pick
the kids up from
the dentist later...
lt'll only take
a few minutes.
l'll see what l can do.
Thanks...
lt's really too bad
what happened to Mrs.
Cutter, isn't it?
Accidents happen.
lt just must
have been her time.
Hey.
College applications.
My adviser said we
should file early in case
we don't get into U of O.
Okay.
Come on.
l'm coming.
lt all sounds
circumstantial
at best to me.
l know, l know it does.
l know it does.
But l'm telling you,
it's really starting
to give me the creeps.
Just think about it, please.
One day,
this woman tells my mom
about this show that she saw,
and the next, she's dead.
She's dead now.
lt was an accident.
You said so yourself.
So how does he know that
she broke her neck
falling down the stairs?
How does he know that?
The mailman never
said anything about that.
l heard the whole
conversation, l swear.
l wish l could tell
my mom about this.
lf you bring
this up to your mom,
she's gonna send you back.
¶ l'm coming up only
to show you wrong
Hey, you got to admit,
the comment at
the dinner table
about the woman
who killed her kids
was kind of weird.
Come on, it was
weird to say the least.
And then his daughter.
How do you mix up
your daughter's
name like that?
He didn't.
Her name was Lisa-Michelle.
That's what you said he said.
l said he said that.
But you weren't there.
Right?
You didn't see his face.
It's in his face.
Let me get this straight,
all right?
The neighborhood weirdo...
Yeah.
...sees a show
about a man who
kills his family
and then you think
that David mixed up
the name of his daughter,
so therefore
he's the guy that
killed his family?
l don't know.
Yeah, that all
adds up to me.
¶ Really too late to call
Look, you said
your dad checked
up on him, right?
And everything was cool.
Yeah.
Okay, then. Right?
lt's fine. Relax.
¶ To know me as hardly golden
Are we gonna finish these?
Babe, come on.
Damn it, Michael.
¶ Is to know me all wrong
They were
¶ At every occasion
l'll be ready for a funeral
Michael.
You're obsessing.
You know, you're just
a little freaked out
that your mom's
marrying a stranger.
l was the same way
when my mom was
gonna marry Jack.
You know? And then
he turned out to be cool.
lf you're gonna
obsess about something,
you should obsess
about something that
really matters.
Like what?
Like me.
l don't want to have
another long-distance
relationship with you.
So keep
your eye on the ball.
¶ l'm coming up only
to show you wrong ¶
l'm gonna pick
up Sean and Beth.
l'll be back in an hour.
Will you two be all right?
Yeah, why wouldn't we be?
l'll see you in
a while then. Behave.
Come on.
What are you gonna do?
l'm just gonna look
through his stuff.
You're crazy.
You're so gonna
regret doing this.
Only if l get caught.
Michael, come on,
l don't want to do this.
Look, if we find nothing,
l'll drop it forever.
l promise.
Hello.
SUSAN: Hey, you.
l just finished shopping,
so l'm gonna pick
the kids up after all.
l just left the house.
l'm on my way.
That's okay 'cause
l'm so much closer.
But thank you.
Well, okay then.
l'll see you at home. Bye.
Okay. Bye.
Did you just hear that?
No.
We're alone, Kelly.
It's fine.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Shit!
Shit!
Michael.
Michael, you in there?
You in here, Michael?
Michael!
Michael,
did you ever hear
from your dad?
Well, l got a text
message from him, so...
Really? What'd he say?
Just that he was sorry
for not coming by
before his flight.
l've tried calling
a couple times and l just
get his voicemail, so...
l don't know.
l'll probably text
him tonight.
Honey, l'm sure he
just got crazy with work.
You know how Dad gets.
Yeah, yeah. No, l know.
BETH: David?
BETH: David, you okay?
Yes, l'm fine.
l know.
l almost pissed my pants,
l was so scared.
You know, that's not
a turn-on, by the way.
Michael, shut up.
l'm being serious.
l know. l know.
You do?
Yeah. l mean,
l've been thinking about
what you said,
about all of it, really.
And l've decided that...
That you're right.
l mean, maybe, maybe,
l am obsessing.
You think?
l mean, my dad said
he was all right, so...
l guess the rest of it
is just me freaking out.
l think you should
come by tomorrow
and we'll get these
college applications finished.
No more obsessing?
No, no, no,
l swear on my life.
All right?
So l'll see you tomorrow.
Okay. Good night.
Okay. Night.
Yeah, come in.
Hey, you got a sec?
Sure. What's up?
How you doing?
Uh, fine.
Maybe l'm wrong,
but for a while there,
l thought we were
off to a good start.
And now l'm getting the
feeling that somehow we're
not on the same page.
l know it can't
happen overnight, Michael.
But for the sake
of the family,
you gotta understand
that things are going
to change around here.
lt's not gonna
be like it was,
but hopefully better.
Yeah, l do. l know.
Good.
l just want you to
always be up-front with me.
No lies,
no sneaking around.
Your mom wouldn't like that.
And you need to
win back her trust.
l don't want to see you
have to go back to
that school again.
You swore on your life.
Just look at the
police sketches.
Please,
that's all l'm asking.
There is a resemblance.
You got to admit,
it kind of looks like him.
You know who this
actually looks like?
It looks like Mr. Rockwell,
our biology teacher
from freshman year.
No, you hardly looked at it.
All right.
It could be anybody.
Look, this is Grady Edwards.
The police couldn't match
his ID.
They couldn't
trace any fingerprints.
And there are similarities.
He said he was in sales.
He said he traveled a lot.
They can never find
any pictures of him either,
so l asked Beth
this morning
if she could find any
pictures of him in the house,
any pictures of David.
There aren't any because
he doesn't like having
his picture taken, apparently.
So what?
Neither do l.
But l swear
l didn't kill that woman
and her kids. Okay?
lt doesn't prove anything.
The website was in
the browser history.
He was checking it out.
So what if he was?
Or maybe it was your mom.
Or maybe they both
were because they were
curious about what
Mrs. Cutter said.
l mean, that's what
made you check it out.
All right.
lt's fine.
Just forget about it.
Are we gonna
finish these, Michael?
Hold on one second.
What is it?
You just don't want to go
to college with me anymore?
By the way,
l'm screwing Mark Helford.
Hmm?
What?
l'm leaving.
l'm going home.
Call me later.
Or, you know what,
don't actually.
l don't care. Whatever.
You know.
Kelly. Kelly, come on.
l'm sorry.
God, l didn't even know
you were there.
You scared me, Mr. Harris.
Call me David.
l was just getting
myself a lemonade.
Do you want one?
No, that's okay.
Looked like Michael
and you were having
a bit of a fight.
No.
lt's nothing, really.
Anything l can
help you with?
No, it's cool.
You sure?
Something seems to
be troubling him.
Maybe the two of us
can help him work it out.
l don't know. It's just...
l don't get it.
He's been such a jerk lately.
lt's called being a guy.
We're all jerks.
That's why you women like us.
We're like projects
you take on.
See, Kelly,
young women like you
seem to mature faster.
lt takes boys a little
Ionger to catch up.
You know,
you might be a part of
the Harding family one day.
And l'd like you to
think of me as you would
the others, as family, too.
Yeah, l do.
l mean, you know, l will.
And if you ever
need anything,
please come to me.
Especially if it
concerns Michael.
Neither of us
want to see him do
something stupid, do we?
Something that might
get him sent back
to military school.
He won't.
But thank you, Mr. Harris.
David. Call me David.
KELLY ON MACHINE:
Hi. l'm not here, l'm there.
Leave a message.
Hey, it's me.
l really want to
see you tonight,
so give me a call. Bye.
Sorry it took
so long to get back.
l'll try to call you
in the next few days.
Hope all is well. Dad.
l've tried to reach you
on your phone.
Want to talk to
you about David.
Call me. Jackie.
This is Jay Harding.
Leave a message.
l have to call
you back on that,
but the money sounds like
we're in the ballpark.
We'll talk tomorrow.
All right.
What's up, Michael?
You look like you've
seen a ghost.
No, l, um...
l heard a phone ring.
l thought it sounded
like it was coming
from the basement.
You probably just heard mine.
l got a call on a job.
l think l'm gonna take it.
Money sounds good.
l won't have to travel much.
Hey, where's the key?
David, where's the key
to the basement?
Yeah, l was wondering
that myself.
l needed to get some of
my tools this morning.
The key was gone.
Someone took it out
and forgot to put it back.
Forgot to put what back?
Hey, honey.
Hey, guys.
DAVID: That key to the lock
on the basement door
is missing.
l'll call a locksmith
in the morning.
Better yet,
l'll go down to
Home Depot and
get a replacement.
That lock was getting old.
l can do the work myself.
By the way,
l think l found a job.
SUSAN: That's fantastic.
Yeah, the pay's good
and very little travel.
l like that.
l thought you would.
Let's celebrate.
Okay.
Maybe you should
get a job this summer.
He's already got one.
He's the lifeguard
at the pool here.
SUSAN: No, no, l'm serious.
That way you could earn
money toward getting a car.
You're getting your license.
You're gonna need
a car of your own.
Especially if you're gonna
spend your senior year
here in Portland.
BETH: Wait, Mom.
SEAN: Are you serious?
BETH: Wait, do you mean that?
SUSAN: Yeah,
l think David's right.
The only way for us
to be a proper family
is if you're home with us.
Besides, when you go
to college, you're not
going to come back.
-Who wants dessert?
SEAN: Oh, me. l do.
l'm gonna drop
Sean and Beth off
at the Kagans,
'cause they're
gonna spend the night
and then Carrie's mom's
gonna drive them up
to camp tomorrow.
Want to ride with me?
l wish l could.
But l need to get
back on the Internet
and finalize this job.
Okay. l should only
be a couple hours.
A couple hours. Okay.
Well, have fun,
guys, huh?
Bye.
Bye.
Bye, David.
Susan.
Yeah.
l love you.
l love you, too.
What are your plans
this evening?
Um...
l might go see Kelly.
For how long?
l don't know. Why?
Just be careful.
The news said
there's a big storm
headed this way.
lt's gone.
What?
The shot l took
of him before?
lt's gone. He deleted it
and now there's no pictures
of him anywhere.
Well, maybe you
deleted it by accident.
No, l didn't...
Have you not been
listening to me?
l thought you said he
didn't see you take it.
Maybe he did or
maybe he's been
checking my phone
this whole time.
l don't know.
But he came
into my room when
l was in the shower.
He deleted it.
l know he did.
He doesn't want
his picture taken.
That doesn't mean
he's a killer.
The key to the basement
didn't just get lost,
all right.
He's always down there.
He's hiding something.
So what's the weather like?
l'm trying to pack.
All you're gonna need
is a bikini and a smile.
Neither if you
forget the bikini,
because l'll have
enough smile for
both of us.
Hold on a sec.
Are you on your cell phone?
Hey. This is Susan.
Leave me a message...
lf you're trying to do
some last-minute business,
give it a rest.
You've got a plane to
catch in three hours.
No, l'm trying
to reach Susan.
l think l did
something stupid.
l called Jay
and l left a message
that l wanted him
to do a background
check on David.
You think you did
something stupid?
Listen,
l called him about the W-2s
and he hung up on me.
He never did anything
he said that he would.
She is going to kill you.
l know. That's why
l need to reach her
before Jay gets to her first.
Okay?
So, please, do me a favor.
l will call you during my
Iayover in L.A., okay?
No, don't.
l'm going on a party cruise
around the island tonight.
Oh, really?
Just get here!
l'm trying.
Love you.
Love you, too. Bye.
JACKIE: l wasn't able
to get you on
your cell phone
before I left
but l wanted' you to know
that l left a message
for Jay to run a
background check on David.
And l haven't heard back,
so l'm gonna call
this investigator
we use at the office
when l get to the airport.
Before you go ballistic,
Iet me tell you
that he refuses to
give any identification
for insurance and payroll.
And he lied to me.
There's something
not right here.
l'm leaving for the airport
in about 20 minutes.
lf we don't talk,
l'll call when l get back.
l love you.
Don't be mad, please.
WOMAN: Portland Tribune.
Hello. l need to
speak to someone about
canceling a subscription.
God, you scared me.
l didn't think
anybody was home.
You're home early.
What, did you go running?
l needed to clear my head.
Did Jackie call?
Not since l've been home.
Because l had a missed call
and she didn't
Ieave a message.
l tried to reach her.
l couldn't.
Where's Michael?
Over at Kelly's.
Oh.
l'm gonna change
clothes real quick.
SUSAN: God,
l hate it when
it storms like this.
l can never sleep
with all this
thunder and lightning.
Here. Take one of these.
What is it?
It's a mild sleeping pill.
They make you so
groggy the next day.
So will no sleep.
Just take half.
Really?
Sure.
l don't like
Michael out in this.
Well, let's call him
and get him home.
No, that's okay.
l've just got to stop
treating him like a child.
All right, stay here.
If you see any movement
upstairs or see
anyone come downstairs,
any lights, call me.
l've got it on vibrate.
Well, Michael,
what are you doing?
l'm gonna find out
what's in those
storage cabinets.
That's insane, Michael.
Really, what if...
Your mom just told
you you could stay.
What do you think's
gonna happen when she
finds out about this?
And she will
find out about it...
Kelly, he's hiding
something in there,
all right? l know he is.
But you have to trust me.
Please. Please.
Just please be careful.
l will. Okay.
Shit.
Where is it?
Honey?
Finally.
God.
Shit!
Michael! Come on!
Come on. Come on.
Pick up, Michael.
Shit!
Michael!
What are you doing, Kelly?
Kelly!
Come on!
Kelly!
Kelly! Kelly!
Kelly!
What's all the noise?
l thought l could make
this work. But l can't!
This isn't the right
family for me.
The boy is a problem.
He has no respect.
You haven't been
hard enough on him.
You've got to make
a boy understand!
You've got to break him
if necessary!
You're too weak to do that.
