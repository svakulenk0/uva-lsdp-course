I know I'm not ugly. I just...
I don't know. I never saw myself
as an A-list-looking guy.
Um, but I went to Indian Hills
to learn and be with my peers.
But I was always self-conscious that I wasn't,
you know, as good-looking as other people.

Okay, this morning's lesson
is on character development.
So in The Secret,
we talk about the law of attraction...
and how we need to be really careful
about who we surround ourselves with...
because we wind up being
the average of those people.
So we are going to make vision boards...
about people who are
demonstrating good character...
like Angelina Jolie.
So, what qualities do you guys
admire about Angelina Jolie?
Her husband.
- Mm-hmm. Okay.
- Anything else?
- Her hot bod.
Okay. Okay.
Well, the hot bod is not a characteristic.
- But... Okay?

Well, we're gonna do it until we finish...
and then we're gonna move on
to the fluorescence work.
Got it.

Here.
- You fucking serious?
- Come on.
MOTHER: Marc?
One second, Mom.
It's time for dinner.
Be right there.
- Hey, Chloe.
Not much. Hey. Did you ever, uh...
Did you ever talk to Ricky
about the Rolexes?
Yeah, yeah.
He's got connects. Bring 'em by later.
Okay. Thanks.
- How'd your audition go today?
- It was all right.
I think it went really well.
They said they want to do a test shoot.
- Oh, good. That's good.
- Yeah.
- What's it for?
- Uh, Axe body spray.
- Oh.
- And we have a “go see” for the BCBG runway show.
Oh, that's huge. Good job.
And that's a cute dress.
Did you get a new dress?
Mm-hmm.
Our friend Marc... he's a stylist.
He let us borrow some stuff
for the auditions.
- That's nice.
- Mmm.
His dad has a production company
that he helps style for.
MOTHER: What's it called?
I don't remember. Like...
- Something... “International.”
- Mmm.
Uh, Mom, we actually have to get going...
because we're meeting this manager tonight
who could be really helpful.
Yeah, he knows a lot of photographers
and producers, so...
- A manager?
- Hmm.
I'd totally do that singer guy.
- But did you see how small his hands are?
- No. Ew.
Yeah, that could be gross.
Dude, we have to get in that video.
- I know.
- Does this look good?
Yeah, I mean, do you feel good in that?
I want to be hot but not desperate.
Totally.
- I think it looks cute.
- Yeah?
- Show me a different top.
- All right.
My butt look good in these jeans?
Your butt looks awesome.
Come on.
MAN: I be fucking your girl
I was texting her only
Told her, “I'd like your legs
better if they was open”
Hey, Ricky. You remember Marc.
Sure. Sure, I do.
So, Marc, what can I do for you?
- Um...
I was wondering if you could, uh...
could sell these for me.
- Where'd you get them?
- Uh, we found them.
I see.
Well, what do you think?
Can you take them?
I don't know.
I could see.
Tell you what.
I'll give you five grand for them.
Aren't they worth a lot more?
Not stolen ones.
Okay. Sweet. Thanks.
Eva, I love those shoes!
Thank you.
Sure, kid.
Ooh.
Oh!
MARC: When we went out, we got in
everywhere, and everyone loved us.
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye now.
Thanks.
WOMAN:
Hey. hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
MAN:
Doin' something mean to it Do it better
than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters
Go! a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero
need his theme music
How many times
have you guys been up here?
MARC: This is, like, our fifth time.
- And she never noticed?
REBECCA: We never take enough for it to be obvious.
I mean, come on. it's Paris Hilton.
- Yeah.
SAM: Yeah, right.
- She's got so much stuff.
MARC: I know, right?
- It's great.
- It's chill.
MARC: I don't know.
You'd never wake up though.
- You'd sleep in all day.
- Here we go.
- Whoa.
- Oh, shit!
ROB: Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here.
MARC: What?
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Hey, Sam.
- What? - Your coat.
ROB: Let's go.
Okay. Let's try it with this.
Now fix your hair.
Oh, yeah.
You could totally pull this off.
You're like an off-duty supermodel.
- Really?
- Yeah.
These Chloé sandals
could work with it too.
- For, like, a day look.
- Yeah, definitely.
- Right?
- Here. Try 'em on.
- Hello?
REBECCA:
- What?
FEMALE NEWSCASTER:
MARC: Oh, my God.
Audrina Patridge posted
this security footage on her Web site.
Shit.
She's asking anyone who has information
about the break-in...
REBECCA:
- Shit. Fuck. One second, Rebecca.
- Just chill out.
I can't talk.
- Everything all right in here?
- Yes, Mr. Hall.
We're sorry for making too much noise.
Everything's fine, Dad.
All right.
You're stressing me out.
Carly keeps texting me. it's so annoying.
Ew. She's so grimy.
I know.
I think I'm gonna go to Sagebrush later.
Cool. Who's playing?
I don't know. A couple local bands.
I want to go to Rachel Bilson's.
She's in Paris for fashion week.
Don't you think you should
chill out a little bit?
Yeah. That news thing
totally freaked me out.
Nothing happened.
There's no way of telling who it is anyway.
Come on.
Can you find her house for me, please?
I want some Chanel.
- I don't know.
- Come on. You're my best friend.
Please? Let's go get some stuff.
We're going to Rachel Bilson's.
Wanna come?
NICKI ON PHONE:
I don't know.
Marc thinks so.
Come on.
MARC: I think the biggest problem was
after the Audrina thing, nothing happened.
It gave Rebecca that self-boost that, “Oh, this is okay.
I can get away with this.”
And I think her projecting that onto me
made me think that it was gonna be okay.
- Yo, Becca.
- Hey. What's up?
I heard you went to Paris Hilton's.
- Yeah.
- And you took some stuff?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's so cool. Paris Hilton.
We're gonna go get a drink. Lates.
I can't believe she went to
Paris Hilton's house.
What up?
Where have you guys been tonight?
- We went to Rachel Bilson's.
- No fucking way!
- Yeah. It was chill.
- Sick!
You went to Rachel Bilson's?
- Yeah. She's in Paris at fashion week.
- Shut the fuck up.
We just went in.
Yeah, look at their chill-ass
Chanel purses, dude.
What the fuck are you doing? Come on.
Come on now.
- Puff, puff, pass.
Puff, puff, puff.
MARC: Rebecca's, like, biggest
conquest was Lindsay Lohan.
FEMALE NEWSCASTER: Lindsay Lohan
is fighting back against accusations...
she stole a $2,500 necklace
from a Southern California jewelry store.
Her attorney addressed
the matter for the first time.
This is the dress she wore
to the Cosmopolitan opening.
Oh, my God. Let me see it.
I want to try it on. it's amazing.
These are cute. These are really useful.
Yeah.
When are you coming back from Vegas?
I don't know. Just gonna stay with my dad
until things calm down with my mom.
- I'll call you from there?
- Okay.
Will you hold on to
some of my stuff for me?
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay. Bye.
Bye.
Ciao.
INTERVIEWER: Why do you think Rebecca was so
obsessed with these women and their clothes...
MARC: I just think she wanted to be
a part of, like, the lifestyle.
Like, the lifestyle
that everybody kind of wants.
Lindsay Lohan gave police
the security footage...
from the night of March 23,
when her house was burglarized.
Comparing the clips...
it looks like these are
the same burglars...
as in the Audrina Patridge
security video...
and police are investigating
the connection...
of the Hollywood Hills burglaries.
If you have any information,
please contact the L.A.P.D.
YOUNG WOMAN: Marc and Rebecca
were bragging about it at a party.
They said they had been in Rachel Bilson's
house and Lindsay Lohan's.
They said they went to Paris Hilton's,
like, eight times.
That's Marc Hall, Rebecca Ahn and Chloe. I
don't know her last name. And Nicki Moore.
MAN: L.A.P.D. Open the door!
L.A.P.D. Open the door!
- Is this the home of Marc Hall?
- Yes.
- We have a search warrant.
- I'll... I'll get him.
Marc.
Mom.
Okay. Whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
It's gonna be okay.
Ma'am.
POLICE OFFICER: You have the right
to remain silent. Understand?
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.
What's going on here?
What's this all about?
- Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to step aside.
- Honey.
You have the right to speak to an attorney
present during any questioning, okay?
And if you cannot afford a lawyer,
one will be provided for you.
All right? Let's go.
- Marc. Over here.
- Marc, right over here!
- Right here, buddy.
- Hey, Marc. Right here.
MAN: Los Angeles Police.
- Yes?
- Ma'am, we're the police.
- Is this the home of Nicolette Moore?
- Yes.
We have a search warrant to search the house.
Ma'am, can you please step out of the way?
- Out of the way.
- For what?
- Is anyone else in the house, ma'am?
- Mom?
MOTHER: My kids.
- Call them downstairs.
- What's going on?
- Come downstairs, you guys. Come downstairs right now.
- What's going on?
- Where are they going?
Ma'am, you need to
secure your animal-now.
Pick up your dog.
Ma'am, you have any weapons in the house?
- No.
- Okay.
What is this about?
Wait. What is going on?
I'll explain everything to you
before we're done. Nicolette?
- Yeah.
- Sit down over there.
- Why?
- What did I do?
POLICE OFFICER: Just sit down.
- Just sit down.
MOTHER: Why?
We're conducting an investigation.
Before we're done...
I promise you I'll explain everything.
- Why do I have to sit down?
- Zip it.
- Put your hands behind your back.
- Mom?
- Mom? Mom?
MOTHER: Excuse me. Sorry.
- Excuse me.
- Get her back.
- Can you stop...
- I need you to stop right here.
- I need to speak to my mom.
- ...what you're doing with my daughter.
I need to speak to my mom. Mom?
- Call the lawyer. Call a lawyer!
- Mom, why are they taking her?
You're hurting me.
You're really hurting me. Mom.
Can you call the...
Ow!
Ow. I want to talk to my mom.
Ow.  Ow.
- Hello? How can I help you?
- Is this the home of Rebecca Ahn?
I'm her mother, but she's staying
with her father in Nevada.
RICKY: Easy, Tank.
What the fuck, man?
Chloe.
- Carrot-beet?
- No.
Crystal, shh! Crystal.
Crystal. Chloe.
Then Rebecca wanted
to go to Orlando Bloom's.
We knew he was away, from the Internet.
You know, you Google his name...
and it says Orlando Bloom's shooting a movie
in New York, and he's with Miranda Kerr.
So we just walked in.
The door was unlocked. There was no alarm.
The door was unlocked?
I'm really sorry about what I did.
Did you know
Rebecca was leaving the state?
I... I just knew that she was going
to stay at her dad's...
because she wasn't getting along
with her mom and her stepdad.
You didn't know she was taking
stolen property...
across state lines
and leaving you holding the bag?
I thought she was just
gonna go see her dad.
Metro Police. Are you Rebecca Ahn?
- Yes.
- We have a warrant to search the premises. Step aside.
Move back.
Bobby. Downstairs.
Jeff, upstairs. See what you find.
Here's your warrant.
Do you know why we're in your home,
serving you a search warrant?
- Yes.
- Why do you think we're here?
My friend Marc was arrested.
He called me from jail...
and said the police had done
a search warrant on his home.
- Do you know why?
- I've been watching
They've been saying I'm a person
of interest in these burglaries.
Were you involved in these burglaries
of these celebrities?
No, I wasn't.
Is there going to be any property from
those burglaries in this residence?
- No.
- Have you ever been...
- to these celebrity homes that were burglarized?
- No.
MAN: Could any
of your fingerprints or D.N.A...
- be found in any of the victims' homes?
- No.
You boys having fun?
Find something interesting? What?
- Yeah, we got a few things on the list.
- Right on.
Anything else?
- Yeah, we also came up with these.
- Nice.
We found a jacket and jeans
that match a description by Lohan...
and some personal photographs
of Paris Hilton.
If I tell you where everything is,
would you let me go?
Hypothetically, let's say I can
help you locate this property...
and tell you who has it,
how would that help me?
FEMALE NEWSCASTER: Rebecca Ahn, thought
to be the ringleader, was arrested...
and awaits her hearing
with the other members.
Stay tuned for the latest
on the Bling Ring.
Did you speak to any of the victims?
I've spoken to all the victims.
Really? What did Lindsay say?
MAN 1: Nicki. Nicki.
MAN 2: Nicki. Nicki.
- How was it in there?
- It was not good.
Okay, thank you.
Nicki. Kate from Vanity Fair is here.
Can I get you something to drink?
So how is Sam related?
NICKI: We have adopted her.
- I was friends with her mother.
- Mom, this is my interview.
- Okay.
Yeah. So, she has been living with us.
Um, we met when my parents divorced...
and now my mom homeschools all of us.
Based on the philosophy of
which is based on the laws of attraction.
- Can I talk, please?
- Sure.
I'm sorry.
The reason that we related so well...
is that my dad
is a recovering alcoholic...
- and Sam's mom...
- She's a practicing...
is a practicing drug addict and alcoholic.
And our moms became, like, best friends.
- We were, and she went off the deep end.
- Please!
- So, basically you took her in.
NICKI: Yes.
We took her in about six years ago.
But let's, uh...
Let's... Let's get back to Nicki, okay?
Uh, so Adam here told me
that you do charity work.
Yes. We do a lot of stuff
through our church.
- Mm-hmm.
- It's called the Agape Church.
- Right.
- It's the religious science philosophy...
beneath
Um, my other sister, Gabby,
is on a trip with them building homes.
And they do a yearly trip to Africa...
where they build wells
and schools for kids.
Which country?
Um, I can't remember
exactly which country...
but we do bake sales and, like, feeding
the homeless and that kind of stuff.
Okay. So there's a little bit
of a disconnect...
between your positive pursuits
and what's happening now.
Nicki, I don't want you
to answer that comment.
Well, I think that I am.
Don't.
I have, like,
a good statement to say about this.
She could speak generally.
I think this situation
was attracted into my life...
as a huge learning lesson for me...
to grow and expand
as a spiritual human being.
I believe that I am an old soul.
You are, honey. She is.
We've gotten to know
Nicki and her family...
and we believe that she is an extremely
focused and honest young woman...
who has a lot to offer the community.
And we agree that there
has not been a disconnect.
That there were circumstances
that happened...
but Nicki herself
has continued to stay on her plane...
despite the tumultuous
experiences happening.
What's your goal, or life plan,
if you have one?
I do. I think it's my journey...
to push for peace
and the health of the planet.
Nicki's expressed to me
a lot of her humanitarianism.
It's my main goal.
I... want to be a leader...
and do things that people really notice.
That's why I'm taking business-
so that I can be a leader...
and-and take a stand for people.
But I went to Indian Hills
to learn and be with my peers...
but I was always self-conscious that I wasn't,
you know, as good-looking as other people.
And now you're a star.
Yeah... On my Facebook page recently...
I had over 800 friend requests.
I accepted them all.
I mean, I didn't even look at them.
- And then I noticed someone
had created a fan page for me.
- Hmm.
It's just kind of awkward
that so many people are loving me...
for... for something
that's so looked down on in society.
If it had been, you know, something
that were to benefit the community...
or something like that, I'd love it.
But it's kind of showing America has this.
This sick fascination
with a Bonnie and Clyde kind of thing.
Does this look good?
Is this conservative?
If you like a secretary-style hooker.
Bite me.
Maybe with a jacket?
Well, it looks better.
Right?
Ah, you need lower heels.
Yeah.
Where are my kitten heels?
You're so lucky
you weren't on that video.
I know. Sucks.
Yeah. It does.
Maybe I need to wear something longer.
Do you own anything longer?
- No.
Mom does.
- Can I have a five-milligram Adderall?
- Mm-hmm.
Okay, just remember
what we went over with Shannon.
They can't prove that you were
in any of those houses, okay?
- I know, Mom.
- All right?
Do you want to just ground ourselves
really quick? Nicki?
I know there is one mind,
one presence and one power.
- Mom, shouldn't we go?
- Emily.
- What? - Stop talking.
- She's praying.
I know I'm always protected,
and karma cleanses my journey.
Thank you, Lord, so much for this truth.
- And so it is.
ALL: And so it is.
So it is. And you rock, girl. Okay?
- Right here. Right here. Nicki. Nicki.
- Okay, Nicki.
- Hey, Nicki, Nicki. Can we get a comment? Nicki.
Nicki.
- Nicki.
- Nicki.
Nicki.
This has been a very difficult time
for myself and my family.
Thank you for respecting my privacy.
I look forward to my day in court.
Chloe!
- Marc.
- Marc.
Right here. Right here.
Hey, Marc.
How does it feel to be a rat?
Okay.
MAN: Remain seated. Come to order.

FEMALE NEWSCASTER: Members of
the Bling Ring were sentenced today...
that netted more than
three million in high-end goods.
We're here with Nicki Moore, who just served 30
days for her involvement in the Bling Ring...
and shared a cellblock
with one of its victims, Lindsay Lohan.
There were reports
that Lindsay was crying.
With you being next to her,
did you actually hear any of this?
Yeah. I could hear her crying
the first day...
which is really hard
when you're just trying to be strong.
But I just really kept to myself...
and just tried to get through the day.
It's hard when you're
woken up at, like, 5:30.
And how'd she look?
She got to keep her extensions in.
A lot of the girls were talking-“Oh,
I had to take my weave out,” or whatever.
But, um, she was in orange like all of us.
Now, were you nervous being next to her?
Because you actually were accused
of being a part of the group...
that allegedly robbed her house.
Yeah. I mean, it was scary for me.
They were showing the surveillance video.
They were showing the story
on TVs inside...
and, you know, little do people know...
that when that first video came out...
I was actually in contact
with her manager...
to tell her who I believed
the people were who robbed her house.
I mean, when I get to tell
my side of this story...
people are gonna know the truth.
So, that's nerve-racking.
She could think you robbed her house.
Yeah. She could have.
But, you know, anyway...
you can follow everything about me
and my journey...
