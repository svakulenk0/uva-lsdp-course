TOHO FILMS AND
KUROSAWA PRODUCTION PRESENT
He looks like me.
Precisely like you.
I have impersonated you for a
long time but he is a miracle.
Where did you find him?
At the execution grounds.
The execution grounds?
He was going to be crucified.
I thought he would be
useful as a double for you.
What did he do?
They found him sneaking around
the grounds. He's a thief.
A thief?
And a tough one. Torture
failed to make him talk.
Possibly, aside from
stealing, he's also killed.
What did the prosecutors say
about his resemblance to me?
Nothing.
Only I, your brother,
could see it from the first.
His hair, clothes, the way
he talks... all so different.
No one has the least idea of
his resemblance to our lord.
Even I, who recognized
the resemblance,
am doubly amazed at the likeness
once we dressed him like you.
Where is he from?
As you see,
he is very much like you.
Our father might have
had a son somewhere else.
But do not fear.
He is a drifter from the north.
He could not be our half brother.
Even with this resemblance, Nobukado,
he is so wicked as to be
sentenced to crucifixion.
How could this scoundrel
be my double?
I only stole a few coins. I'm petty thief.
But you've killed hundreds
and robbed whole domains.
Who is wicked?
You or I?
I was going to be crucified.
My life could have ended this day.
I am immune to threats.
Boil me! Broil me!
Very well.
Say whatever you want.
If you will not say it, I will.
I am wicked, as you
believe. I am a scoundrel.
I banished my father
and I killed my own son.
I will do anything to rule this country.
War is everywhere.
Unless somebody unifies the
nation and reigns over us,
we will see more rivers of blood
and more mountains of the dead.
It is cold.
My old wound hurts when the air is cold.
Nobukado, he has spoken
hastily. He might be of some use.
Train him.
KAGEMUSHA
In the 16th century,
Japan is torn by war.
Warriors vie for the capital Kyoto,
for the conqueror will rule Japan.
There are three rivals.
Shingen, Nobunaga and Leyasu.
In 1572, Shingen marches toward Kyoto.
We've cut the waterway into the castle.
The castle will soon fall.
I hope so.
We have had it surrounded for 20 days.
I don't think the enemy
leader will surrender soon.
Someone plays the flute every night.
And he plays well.
Our men are impressed. They
like to hear it at night.
Listen!
We must let my father know
we've cut the aqueduct.
Lord Shingen, your father, is here.
Except for us chief vassals,
not only the enemy, but our own
men believe the lord is here.
It is needless to
send messengers to him.
Sire, Masakage Yamagata is here.
Send him in.
Leave us alone.
My lord.
I'm angry.
Asakura sent me a message.
He is returning to his fief.
His men are weary and it is mid winter.
The enemy is also tired.
If Asakura retreats,
Nobunaga will reinforce
Leyasu and block my way.
Asakura's retreat is treason against me.
How old are you, sire?
- 53, as I remember.
- Why?
And you still behave like
a five-year-old child.
People gather, scatter.
They go left and right
following their interests.
That is not surprising. But
then I find you like this.
With such a narrow mind, you
must not dream of rulership.
Go back to your own domain.
You are a mountain monkey.
You should be gathering
nuts in the mountains of Kai!
That's enough.
What brought you here?
We've cut the aqueduct.
Will the castle fall soon?
I wonder. There will be rain and snow.
The castle can stand longer.
The garrison leader is a fine warrior.
He lets us hear the flute at night.
I heard about that flute.
Will he play again
tonight without water?
If we hear him tonight
the garrison will hold.
The castle will not fall.
But if we do not hear the
flute, the castle is doomed.
Its fall is near.
I want to hear if the
flute is played tonight.
Prepare my seat in the castle.
What? Shingen is dead?
According to our spy, there
is a rumor that he was shot.
Stupid! It's just talk.
Is he alive? Is he
dead? That is the point.
Bring a stool.
There is only one thing in
the world that can frighten me.
That mountain monkey.
He has bothered me.
His death helps.
I would go to Kyoto and take a nap.
Discover the truth of
his death. Understand?
My horse!
What? Lord Shingen is dead?
A sniper shot him. He was badly wounded.
Is he dead or alive?
Either way it is a chance
for our Tokugawa Clan.
Be quiet. Even if he did beat
me at the battle of Mikata,
I am no coward. His
death does not please me.
As a warlord, he has been unrivalled.
He is just over 50.
If he really dies, it is a great loss.
We have won many
battles. Why retreat now?
Strange.
I heard this rumor.
Our Lord's been shot.
Open your eyes and look for yourself.
Lord Shingen is over there.
To occupy Kyoto,
to put my flags in the capital,
has been my long-cherished dream.
But,
if I die, we must forget it.
Let it be a dream.
Remember.
My death must not be known.
Keep it a secret for
at least three years.
Guard our domain. Never move from it.
Do not move.
If you ignore my order
and leave to attack,
our Takeda Clan will be no more.
Note that, men.
Consider it my will.
Father.
But I am not going to die.
I said
I must prepare for the worst.
But, no.
I will not die.
The lancet holes of the
castle were like this.
And the target?
Under the stone wall
of the second tower.
If I am similarly here,
that pine tree is the same
distance and direction.
You saw Takeda's men make
a seat there during the day?
They put up three bamboo
poles with white paper.
I thought an enemy lord might
go there to listen to the flute.
I set up my gun during the day.
Do as you did then.
I put the gun through
the lancet hole like this.
I steadied my aim and
waited for the night.
Shoot.
Go ahead. Shoot.
It was dark, at night, no bonfire.
I could not see.
Some time after the flute began,
I pulled the trigger like this.
Then what?
As soon as I shot,
noises came from the
spot I aimed at, like now.
Calm them.
Now we can believe that
Shingen was wounded.
Not yet.
If he was,
the Takeda army would
have annihilated the enemy.
They would have tried to
kill this sniper at least.
No.
They want to keep it a
secret. They would not.
They made peace when
they had almost won.
And they returned home.
It is strange. A ruse, perhaps.
Have we crossed the Seta Bridge?
I can see Kyoto.
Occupy it! Put my flags in the capital!
Our lord?
I cannot see him yet.
What a sight. Beautiful.
The invincible Takeda army.
Keep your line!
I don't think we can keep
my father's death a secret.
Some saw his body in the palanquin.
I took care of them. They died.
But there are spies
from Nobunaga and Leyasu.
You must observe your father's will.
We must try our best.
Nobukado impersonated
the late lord in battle.
The enemy has never known.
We must deceive our own men too.
But Nobukado cannot do that.
And the secret will be out.
Exactly.
I cannot myself deceive our men.
But if there were another
double of the lord...
Another double?
I have prepared for such an occasion.
Take a look at him.
Come in.
Remove your mask.
Where is the lord?
You were born base!
You cannot see a lord so easily.
Make way for the lord!
You saw him?
Yes.
I think it is Shingen.
Let's have a closer look.
It might be a double.
I'm sure it is Shingen.
Leyasu sent you?
Nobunaga sent me.
I don't understand.
I found a guarded
palanquin hurrying north.
I thought Shingen was in it.
A doctor was beside it. I
thought Shingen was wounded.
But look at that.
Shingen was not in the palanquin.
Listen.
The party rested, then
returned to the main force.
And the doctor's servant
was killed on the pass.
It doesn't make sense.
Why did they turn back?
Why did the servant have to be killed?
But it is Shingen. No doubt about it.
That is right. It is Shingen himself.
Do not push your luck! What
if someone saw you just now?
Impossible.
He was dying before. Now he's healthy.
You do not know the truth.
Are your spies blind? Old? Deaf?
Shingen had some reason
to return home so abruptly.
He must be wounded, or dead.
If he were healthy, he would
have surrounded us by now.
Do not move!
You've disappointed me.
Of all things, you tried
to steal and escape.
I can play the role of his
double from time to time.
But not from morning till
night. It is too much.
Besides,
the lord is already dead.
You lied to me. You tricked me.
Shut up. Do as you are told.
You cannot treat me like this.
Come, come.
There is a good reason.
We must keep the lord's
death a secret, as he wished.
What do you mean?
We must pretend he is alive.
But these three know.
Those who were close to him should know.
I was intending to tell you, too.
I want you to keep this role.
Not anymore. I cannot.
- Do not be obstinate.
- It is not that.
The lord is dead. I have
no duty to anyone else.
Listen. He wanted to hide his death.
Because he wanted to live
with us for three more years.
If you have any duty
toward him it is now.
Perhaps you are right, but I
had been thinking he was alive.
Then I found him dead.
Suddenly, it all seemed stupid!
Hopeless. We cannot use him.
There is no other way. Only
he can deceive everyone.
Listen.
If you refuse to act as
the lord, you will die.
You saw the lord's corpse.
But if you help us,
you will be rewarded and
released in three years.
You owe your own life to Nobukado.
He is asking you now.
Enough!
No matter what you say, he
will never understand us.
Mind you, he has nothing
to do with the Takeda Clan.
It is selfish of us to
make him solve our problems.
This role is for someone who
can die for the Takeda Clan.
Release him.
But if he goes free,
then everyone will know.
There is no way not to.
Tomorrow,
we will bury the lord's body
in Lake Suwa as he wished.
This is no time for killing.
Day after tomorrow,
it will be a sad march home.
Let us discuss it.
What are they doing?
What is in that jar?
Strange. The jar is gone.
What happened?
I have it.
I thought the jar contained
a treasure, but I was wrong.
They would not abandon that.
And the Takeda warriors
behaved unusually.
I am sure the jar
contained Shingen's body.
The man we saw from the
mountain was his double?
Definitely.
Three spies were in that hut.
They saw everything. Send
your men to kill them!
We are going to tell our
soldiers of his death today.
Naturally, the enemy will know at once.
Leave.
What do you want? Payment
for the information?
No.
Let me help you.
I do not want any
reward. Make use of me.
I want to be of some use to him.
Use me.
I beg you.
Ajar of sake dedicated to the
god of the lake this morning.
What did it say?
Now I'm disappointed.
The jar contained sake.
Sake?
It was dedicated to the god of the lake.
Is that all?
Then is Shingen alive?
Wait.
There will be a Noh performance tonight.
We will see if the lord is real.
It is a lucky day.
Boys' Festival and now the
return of your grandfather.
Will my father come home?
But you are the heir.
You will be the first to greet the lord.
I know. He is the master here.
And next to him, you.
Why do I come before my father?
I do not know.
Lord Katsuyori, your
father, is your guardian.
You are his charge until you grow up.
Hurry. The heralds are at the gate.
Now go and greet them.
The East Gate?
No. You will see him in the Main Hall.
The lord is back!
First, enter the Bishamon Hall.
Next, the Fodo Hall,
then the Izuna Hall.
And then the Main Hall.
Understand?
I have already taught you how to behave.
Congratulations, my lord.
No! He is not my grandfather.
What are you saying?
He's fought many months. His
countenance may have changed.
Besides, he suffered an
illness during the battle.
A serious illness can change us.
Go closer to him.
Have a good look at him.
It's true. He has changed.
I'm not afraid of him anymore.
That's good!
That was close.
I should have thought of it.
Children understand.
But you treated him properly. Well done.
I did not know what else to do.
That is all right. The late
lord was straightforward.
He stepped straight into
the hearts of the others.
Remember that. Behave
as your heart wishes.
That is best.
The hidden guard room.
When the lord gives audience,
guards are waiting here.
Also, guards are here all night.
The sutra room.
The lord reads the sutras here.
And this is the living room.
The lord relaxes here.
Beyond is his bedroom.
These three attendants and
two pages know everything.
They will take care of you.
One of them will always be at your side.
Behave as they bid. You
will not be suspected.
These people know who you truly are.
They are like your
family. Be frank with them.
I have chosen clever boys for you.
I know it is difficult.
I was for a long time the lord's double.
It was torture.
It is not easy to suppress
yourself to become another.
Often I wanted to be myself and free.
But now I think this was selfish of me.
The shadow of a man can
never desert that man.
I was my brother's shadow.
Now that I have lost him,
it is as though I am nothing.
Well, you are going to
meet the lord's mistresses.
These men will teach you manners.
Study the structure of this mansion.
Don't get lost in your own house.
My name is Tsuchiya, chief attendant.
Amemiya is mine.
Hara is mine.
Amari is mine.
Tomono is mine.
Do not be too proud.
What are you doing?
The late lord never did that.
How is this?
Little Takemaru was a problem,
but the horse is worse.
It can tell. Only the
late lord could ride it.
If the double falls off,
everyone will suspect.
Lord Shingen has been ill.
He must refrain from riding.
Good idea.
There are many other problems.
We must be careful to keep
the late lord's intentions.
Tonight he will have to meet
the late lord's mistresses.
How will he be with them?
Our master has been ill.
He must refrain from riding.
Where is Lord Katsuyori?
With Takemaru.
He is another problem.
Maybe the biggest.
He has never once smiled
since his son Takemaru
was chosen as heir.
No wonder.
He has won many battles.
Now he is a mere guardian.
He cannot be happy.
And above that, he has
to call a thief
As do we.
Forget such personal feelings.
We must be united.
That is all.
I will return to Suwa Castle.
He is late. But we cannot
go any further. I am worried.
Nobukado is with him.
Besides, even I cannot
tell which is which.
He will be safe.
Will he? In bed?
Do I look like a different man?
You have not changed in appearance,
but your voice has changed
because of the illness.
The way you talk, too.
A serious illness can
change even a man's heart.
On second thought, you do
look like a different man.
Very well. The game is over.
Actually,
I am not Lord Shingen.
I impersonate the lord.
You are joking.
It is true.
Nobukado became tired
of the work and hired me.
Ask him.
Isn't that true, Nobukado?
Look at me carefully.
I am not your master.
You are drunk, sire.
It is late. Good night.
The master will not
stay with either of you.
The doctor said he
must not exert himself.
You are the leader of the Takeda Clan.
No one may deny this.
You.
The late lord destroyed Lord
Suwa who owned this castle.
He loved Suwa's daughter
and you are the result.
You are Suwa's grandson. He
could not appoint you heir.
So he compromised and made
your son Takemaru his heir.
In his heart, he always
thought the position yours.
No. I was not a son to him.
He always treated me
as one of his retainers.
No.
He wished to be buried in
Lake Suwa, in his armor.
Do you know why?
Because he wanted to
be near you, to aid you.
Since you live here in Suwa Castle,
I believe this shows his feelings.
He forbade me to use his banner
with the four letters for
Wind, Forest, Fire, Mountain.
It represents the head
of the Takeda Clan.
That banner represents your late father.
He forbade you to use it because
he wanted you to surpass him,
to fly your own banner.
My father's intention was to ignore me.
His own chief retainers
treat me with disrespect.
Consider this, even
if this was his plan,
how could I call a thief
my father, bow down to him?
But now your name as a
brave warrior is well known.
The day will come when the
retainers will kneel to you.
Why are you called a
mountain, Grandfather?
Mountain?
Everybody calls you that.
Is it because we have that
mountain in our garden?
You know the master's banner.
What do the letters mean?
Swift as the wind. Quiet as a forest.
Fierce as fire. Immovable as a mountain.
The lord is that mountain.
Both in battle and at home,
he is steadfast, like a mountain.
When his army moves,
first, the horsemen
attack as fast as the wind.
Second, the lancers
advance quiet as a forest.
Third, the cavalry raids
mercilessly as fire.
And the lord is behind them,
always watching over them,
immovable as a mountain.
That is why our soldiers
can fight so strongly.
Immovable as a mountain.
The lord is that mountain.
So we call him the mountain.
I see.
Understand, Takemaru?
The spies agree Shingen
has returned home.
There were no other reports.
I don't understand. It was
his chance to take Kyoto.
Nobunaga, his rival, is
busy fighting other warlords.
Shingen would not miss
such an opportunity.
Very well. Let's attack.
Attack whom?
Takeda's outlying castles.
Attack them
and watch Takeda's reaction.
Their reaction will tell us
if Shingen is behind them.
Messenger from Lord Katsuyori!
What are you doing? Nobukado is coming.
Be careful. They'll see you.
Tonight, as soon as
Lord Katsuyori arrives,
we will have a conference
of the entire clan.
You will have only to sit
with dignity and listen.
The decisions will be
made by the generals.
Then I will say:
"The discussion is over. Let
us have your instructions. "
Then you will nod in
satisfaction and say:
And then stand up and leave. Understand?
Well done. Thanks to you all.
And then stand up and leave.
Do not try to put on airs.
The late lord was like a mountain.
Act naturally.
Like him.
The discussions are concluded.
Let us make our decision.
Leyasu is unforgivable.
We beat him once at Mikata.
He did not learn and
now he is attacking us.
I will drive them all from our domain.
Only one castle has fallen.
You need not go yourself.
He must study Leyasu's moves
to understand his purposes.
The Tokugawa army has
burned Okabe Castle.
Now they are surrounding
Futamata Castle.
We must counterattack
now to save Futamata.
The castle is protected by
Anayama. It is impregnable.
If it is in danger, he
will ask the lord for help.
Leyasu does not move capriciously.
He studies our reactions
to his initial attack.
He is young but very
thoughtful, cunning.
That's why Nobunaga trusts him.
He frightens me.
We must discover what
he meant by this attack.
That is first.
But it will be too late when
we find out what he meant.
Attack now,
or wait and see.
What does our lord think?
Father, what are your instructions?
Do not move.
A mountain does not move.
Well done. Thanks to you all.
Lord Katsuyori behaved badly.
He knew it was the late lord's double.
But that man countered beautifully.
We cannot approve.
He shamed Katsuyori
publicly. He went too far.
I admire his wit, standing up like that.
But sometimes a witty man
depends too much on his wits.
He must stay within
the limits of his role.
I know.
Still, he impressed me.
Even though he's tough,
it must be torture.
He must feel as if he
were truly on the cross.
What is it?
A dream.
A million enemies surrounded me.
Tell Leyasu this.
While I fight Lord Asai,
ride out and see if
Shingen is really dead.
Just asking will not
help discover the truth.
Amen.
Noda Castle and Nagashino
Castle have fallen.
You're good, Grandfather.
Another war?
Are you scared?
No. But you'll be gone. I'll miss you.
Noda and Nagashino have
fallen. Where is Leyasu?
He and his men have
surrounded Futamata Castle.
Katsuyori's gone to battle.
What? Without a conference? On his own?
Where did he go?
Takatenjin.
Takatenjin Castle?
Not a bad strategy.
If he takes the castle,
Leyasu will be threatened.
Only if he takes it.
Even his father failed to
take it. I do not think he can.
Leyasu has a chance to
attack him from the rear.
You may go.
We must send our troops to protect him.
Shingen's banners will make
Leyasu believe he is there.
That is right. The banners
will frighten him away.
May, 1574
The lord's banners in the rear.
Do not move. No matter what. Understand?
Not again. He stands
behind me at every battle.
He treats me like a child.
Let him. We will take over
this castle with our own hands.
Tell the men to break into the castle.
No, burn it.
What is this?
A group of horsemen are coming this way.
Our side support?
What flags?
No flags.
Ours or theirs?
I cannot tell.
Now I see! The enemy!
Make walls of those lances.
Battle formation.
The enemy! A raid!
Keep calm.
Let them go!
Come back!
Enemy on the left hillside!
Enemy on the left. Attack!
Enemy's retreated!
Back to first battle form!
Look.
They died protecting you.
Imagine you are already
crucified. Do not move.
What is that?
Enemy on the right. The
banner is marked "Hon".
It is Heihachi Honda, one of
Tokugawa's bravest generals.
Enough. Pull back.
Do not move!
But I still feel Shingen
is dead. I do not know why.
That is what I feel.
Why?
I do not know. I just feel so.
We both hope Shingen will
die. It would help us greatly.
So we anticipate his death.
We long for it.
Maybe that is all.
The color is like blood,
but it is European wine.
What is the matter? Do you not like it?
Well...
I'll stop those religious
rioters in Ise. I'm quite busy.
I've been too late to help you.
This gold expresses my regrets.
I will leave Takeda to you. Farewell.
Nobody can deny that you
took Takatenjin Castle.
Even your father failed to take it.
No!
It is true I took the castle.
But the credit does not go to me.
It goes to my late father
who frightened the enemy away.
I cannot escape from him after all.
The chief retainers are to blame.
They use the lord's double
to make you seem small.
The mountain?
In the garden, with Takemaru.
This will not do.
I told you, one of you must be with him.
I am sorry.
He is now well used to
living in this house.
He has become sure of
himself since Takatenjin.
He is doing well.
As if the late lord were inside him.
And he's charmed Takemaru, too.
The child loves him.
It makes me sad to see it.
That is so.
It is a cruel thing to do.
Some day he will know.
It will not be long.
The third year is almost
over, keeping this secret.
When the day comes,
it is not only Takemaru
who is to be pitied.
What will happen to the double?
A double means something only
when there is an original.
When the original is gone,
what will happen to the double?
Where is the lord?
He's great. Only he can ride that horse.
Nobukado, he doesn't have the scar.
The wound he got at Kawanakajima.
So he is an impersonator after all.
Grandfather!
This man is not your grandfather.
He's an impersonator.
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
How stupid.
He could deceive men, but not the horse!
I was to blame.
You have taken care so
that we have done properly.
We thank you for that.
Lord Katsuyori has arrived.
The play is over. Lord
Katsuyori is our master now.
From Nobukado.
He appreciates all you've done.
This is with the compliments
of the other generals.
Take it.
Keep well.
Go away. Get out of here.
I want to see Takemaru
and say good-bye.
Takemaru? What impudence!
How dare you? Go!
April, 1575
What? They conducted Shingen's funeral?
That is like Shingen.
For three years after his death,
he successfully deceived me.
Even the 50 years of a man's life
Is short compared to that of this world
Life is but a dream,
a vision, an illusion
Life, once given, cannot last forever
Katsuyori has left his
domain, with 25,000 soldiers,
heading for Nagashino.
The mountain has moved!
My lord, what do you
think that bar of light is?
A rainbow.
No. It is your late father's
instructions not to proceed.
He is telling you to stay
in your domain, to guard it.
Those were your father's last words.
Do so. Then nothing can harm us.
Harm us? Nothing could.
Our ancestors never
lost a single battle.
We never retreat.
Forward!
May 21, 1575
Wind. Fire. This will
be the end of our clan.
Good-bye. I will go first.
Wind. Forest. We will meet
again where Lord Shingen is.
Attention!
Takeda will be no more.
The mountain has moved.
Messenger.
Tell the gunners to
shoot the horses first.
The Takeda cavalry cannot
fight without horses.
