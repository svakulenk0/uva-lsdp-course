Announcer:
WAS DRIVEN FROM THE CITY,
THE REPUBLIC OF ROME
RULES MANY NATIONS,
BUT CANNOT RULE ITSELF.
THE CITY IS CONSTANTLY
ROILED BY CONFLICT
BETWEEN THE COMMON PEOPLE
AND THE NOBILITY.
POWER IS SHARED
AND ORDER MAINTAINED
BY TWO SOLDIERS--
OLD FRIENDS--
GNAEUS POMPEY MAGNUS
AND GAIUS JULIUS CAESAR.
ONCE, POMPEY WAS ACKNOWLEDGED
BY ALL TO BE THE GREATER MAN,
BUT FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS,
WHILE POMPEY HAS KEPT
THE PEACE IN ROME,
CAESAR HAS WAGED A WAR
OF CONQUEST IN GAUL
THAT HAS MADE HIM
EVER MORE RICH AND POPULAR.
THE BALANCE
OF POWER IS SHIFTING,
AND THE NOBILITY
HAVE GROWN FEARFUL.
THOUGH OF NOBLE BLOOD
HIMSELF,
CAESAR STANDS
WITH THE COMMON PEOPLE.
A MAN LIKE THAT--
AN ARISTOCRAT WITH
SOLDIERS, MONEY
AND THE LOVE OF THE PEOPLE--
MIGHT MAKE HIMSELF KING.
PULLO, FORMATION!
-
- PULLO!
SINGLE FORMATION!
SHIELDS ON ME!
GET BACK IN FORMATION,
YOU DRUNKEN FOOL.
REFORM!
Man:
LEGIONARY TITUS PULLO
IS A HERO OF THE 13th LEGION,
- BUT LOOK AT HIM NOW.
-
JUSTICE KNOWS
EVERY MAN'S NUMBER.
HE HAS COMMITTED
A TERRIBLE SACRILEGE,
AND HE WILL PAY FOR IT
WITH HIS LIFE!
AS WILL ANY MAN HERE
WHO BREAKS THE LAW.
BRAWLERS AND DRUNKARDS
WILL BE FLOGGED.
THIEVES WILL BE STRANGLE
DESERTERS
WILL BE CRUCIFIED.
IS THAT IT?
I WAS JUST BEGINNING
TO ENJOY MYSELF.
Man:
BEFORE YOU...
VERCINGETORIX,
SON OF CELTIL,
CHIEFTAIN OF THE TRIBE
OF THE ARVERNI,
COMMANDER OF THE REBEL
STRONGHOLD OF ELYSIA,
KING OF ALL THE GAULS.
WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE OF HIM?
-
- CAESAR!
-
- CAESAR!
CAESAR!
CAESAR! CAESAR! CAESAR!
HEY!
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
HEY-- HERE!
YOU PISS-DRINKING
SONS OF CIRCUS WHORES!
THE CHIEF OF THE GAULS
HAS SURRENDERED TO CAESAR.
THE WAR IS OVER.
DON'T SATHATY
THE BOYS HAVE BEEN GIVEN
TWO DAYS LIBERTY
TO SACK THE TOWN
AND TAKE PERSONAL SPOILS.
THEY'LL ALL BE RICH.
AND ME IN HERE!
HEY!
-
- COME ON, GET IN THERE!
ARE YOU INSANE?
THAT'S A FLOOR PRICE.
WE'LL PAY THE USUAL PREMIUM
FOR TRADESMEN AND FERTILE
WOMEN, ET CETERA.
FROM POMPEY MAGNUS, SIR.
Man:
SET THE FLOOR
CLOSEREIGH TO
Pompey's voice:
"MY DEAR FRIEND
AND PARTNER, GAIUS,
I HAVE TERRIBLE NEWS."
Woman:
FORGIVE ME.
FORGIVE ME.
I FORGIVE YOU.
I FORGIVE YOU.
- BE GOOD TO MY SLAVES.
- I WILL.
AND Y FATO MER.
I WILL.
KISS ME.
YOUR HAIR.
FUNNY.
Man:
THIS ISN'T MISERABLE
EASTERN PEASANTRY.
THIS IS THE CREME
OF THE GALLIC NATIONS.
A GLUT ON THE MARKET.
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO GIVE THEM AWAY.
- SEVEN, AND BE DONE WITH IT.
- ON DELIVERY TO MASILIA?
- OH, PLEASE!
- AGREED. SEE TO THE DETAILS.
I HOPE YOU GOT
A DECENT PRICE OFF
THOSE PARASITES.
GOOD ENOUGH.
NEWS FROM ROME?
POMPEY WRITES.
MY DAUGHTER JULIA
HAS DIED IN CHILDBIRTH.
I GRIEVE WITH YOU.
THE CHILD?
A GIRL-- STILLBORN.
POMPEY WILL BE NEEDING
A NEW WIFE.
CAESAR! AESAR!  CAESAR!
MORE OF CAESAR'S SPOILS
FROM GAUL.
CAESAR! CAESAR!
WHAT A DREADFUL NOISE
PLEBS MAKE WHEN THEY'RE HAPPY.
THIS IS MUSIC.
WAIT UNTIL CAESAR
STARTS THEM HOWLING
FOR OUR BLOOD.
THEN YOU'LL HEAR
SOMETHING DREADFUL.
Man:
A FINE REWARD IS OFFERED
FOR THE RETURN
OF A SLAVEWOMAN,
STOLEN OR ABSCONDED
FROM THE HOUSE
OF MARIUS DOLABELLA.
UNDER THE PROTECTION
OF POMPEY MAGNUS
AND JULIUS CAESAR,
SENATE SITS TOMORROW.
BE AWARE!
NO DISORDER
WILL BE TOLERATED.
Man #2:
YES, THEY COME FROM
A PALMERIAN SOURCE.
-
-
THAT WAS
LOVELY, TIMON.
TWO STALLIONS
HAVE COME TO ROME TODAY.
OF COURSE,
HOW CHILDISH OF ME.
- YOU WANT THE HORSE.
- I DO.
BUT DON'T
BE SULLEN NOW.
THIS WAS NOT
A HARDSHIP F ME.
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND SOMETHING
PERVERSELY EROTIC
ABOUT GOATY LITTLE MEN.
DO PLEASE DON'T LURK,
OCTAVIAN. COME IN.
DON'T BE A GOOSE.
COME IN.
I'VE BOUGHT A HORSE.
HAVE YOU?
THE BEST HORSE IN ROME
BY ALL ACCOUNTS.
VERYI'M APPY
FOR YOU.
IT'S A GIFT
FOR YOUR GREAT-UNC
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
THE ANIMAL TO GAUL
AND GIVE ITTO HIM IN PERSON.
- WHY?
- WELL, WHEN HE'S
BACK IN ROME,
EVERYONE WILL BE
GIVING HIM GIFTS.
WE MUST BE FIRST.
I DOUBT HE WILL RETURN
TO ROME ANYTIME SOON.
THE SENATE'S HOSTILITY
WILL PREVENT HIM.
- LEGALLEAKING, IT IS NOT--
- PLEASE DON'T START
SPEAKING LEGALLY.
- YOU KNOW HOW IT BORES ME.
- IT'S A LONG WAY TO GAUL.
EXACTLY.
WHILE YET A MERE BOY,
YOU WOULD RISK YOUR LIFE
TO HONOR YOUR BELOVED
GREAT-UNCLE.
YOU RIDE
INTO CAESAR'S CAMP ALONE,
ON A NOBLE WHITE STALLION.
THAT'S A GIFT
HE WON'T SOON FORGET.
- ALONE?
- WELL, YOU'LL HAVE
PLENTY OF SLAVES.
YOU'LL BE PERFECTLY SAFE.
AND YOU'LL MAKE YOUR MAMMA
VERY PROUD AND HAPPY.
CATO,
THE SENATE HEARS YOU.
POMPEY MAGNUS...
I HAVE A QUESTION CONCERNING
YOUR FRIEND AND CO-CONSUL--
THE DARLING OF VENUS,
GAIUS JULIUS CAESAR.
WHY DOES HIS CHAIR
REMAIN EMPTY?
WHY DOES HE NOT COME HOME?
HIS ILLEGAL WAR IS OVER.
GAUL IS LONG SINCE
ON IT'S KNEES.
WHY DOES CAESAR
KEEP HIS BRAVE SOLDIERS
FROM THEIR FAMILIES
AND FRIENDS?
FOR EIGHT LONG YEARS,
HE HAS GORGED HIMSELF
LIKE A WOLF
ON THE BLOOD OF GAUL,
AND THEREBY MADE HIMSELF
MONSTROUSLY RICH.
- WHY?
- SIT DOWN!
WHY DOES HE PLY THE MOB
WITH RACES AND FIGHTS
AND GAUDY FEASTS?
WHY HAS HE PAID THE DEBTS
OF EVERY REPROBATE FOOL
IN THIS SENATE HOUSE?
WHY?!
I'LL TELL YOU WHY
HE DOES THESE THINGS.
HE WANTS TO BUY HIMSELF
A CROWN.
HE WANTS TO DESTROY
THE REPUBLIC
AND RULE ROME
AS A BLOODY TYRANT!
- THAT'S WHY!
-
THEREFORE, I MOVE...
THAT CAESAR'S
GOVERNORSHIP IN GAUL
BE TERMINATED IMMEDIATELY,
THAT HIS ARMIES
BE DISBANDED
AND THAT HE BE RECALLED
TO ROME TO ANSWER CHARGES
OF ILLEGAL WARFARE,
THEFT, BRIBERY
AND TREASON!
VERY GOOD, CATO.
FULL OF VIM AND VERVE,
AS USUAL.
CAESAR...
HAS BEEN GENEROUS
TO THE PEOPLE
BECAUSE HE LOVES
THE PEOPLE AS I DO.
IT IS THE PEOPLE THAT RULE,
NOU FINE NOBLEMAN.
IT IS POMPEY'S SOLDIERS
THAT RULE,
NOT WE FINE NOBLEMAN.
I'M GOING TO SAVE US ALL
HOURS OF USELESS CLAMOR
AND USE MY CONSULAR VETO
ON YOUR MOTION.
- YES!
- Pompey: I DO NOT--
- I DO NOT--
-SILENCE!
ARE WE CHILDREN?
LET THE CONSUL SPEAK
THANK YOU, CICERO.
- I DO NOT--
- HOWEVER...
IF I MIGHT SAY
A FEW WORDS BEFORE
YOU CONTINUE.
WHEN CONFRONTED
BY A HUNGRY WOLF,
IT IS UNWISE
TO GOAD THE BEAST,
AS CATO WOULD HAVE US DO.
BUT IT IS EQUALLY UNWISE
TO IMAGINE
THE SNARLING ANIMAL
A FRIEND
AND OFFER YOUR HAND
AS POMPEY DOES.
PERHAPS YOU WOULD
HAVE US CLIMB A TREE.
CAESAR IS MY BROTHER
BY SACRED OATH.
I KNOW HIS HEART.
HE IS MY FRIEND
AND A FAITHFUL
SON OF THE REPUBLIC.
AND UNTIL ANYONE PROVES
THAT HE IS NOT,
I WILL NEVER BETRAY HIM.
-
-
POMPEY MAGNUS,
MY DEAR FELLOW,
YOU'RE WELL MET.
SCIPIO, CATO.
I WOULD NOT TAKE YOU
FOR LOVERS OF THE MIME.
YOU KNOW MY DAUGHTER,
CORNELIA.
WIDOW OF NOBLE PUBLIUS
WHO DIED AT CARRHAE.
CORNELIA, YOUR HUSBAND
WAS A FINE ROMAN.
I THANK YOU.
FATHER, MY PRESENCE
IS NOT APPROPRIATE.
THERE'S A LEWD WOMAN
ON THE STAGE.
I HAD NO NOTION.
WE WILL NOT
LINGER THEN.
POMPEY,
A PLEASANT GOOD NIGHT.
IF IT PLEASE YOU,
MIGHT WE SPEAK ALONE?
NEITHER
WE ARISTOCRATS ALONE
NOR YOU
AND YOUR SOLDIERS ALONE
CAN CRUSH CAESAR.
STOP THERE.
I DO NOT SAY THAT
YOU WISH TO CRUSH CAESAR,
I ONLY SAY
THAT IF YOU DID WISH IT,
YOU COULD NOT DO IT ALONE.
I HAVE NO NEED
OF YOU NOBLE GENTLEMAN.
I HAVE ONLY
TO STAMP MY FEET
AND LEGIONS WILL SPRING UP
ALL OVER ITALY!
I CAN SQUASH CAESAR
LIKE AN INSECT
IF I WISHED IT SO.
I DO NOT WISH IT.
RENOUNCE HIM, POMPEY!
RENOUNCE CAESAR!
ALLY YOURSELF WITH US
AND HIS STRENGTH WILL
WITHER AWAY.
IT IS YOU WHO IS
THE REAL POWER.
IT IS YOU
THE PEOPLE TRULY LOVE.
THINK YOU THEY WILL
STILL SHOUT CAESAR'S NAME
WHEN HE RUNS OUT
OF GALLIC TRINKETS
TO THROW TO THEM?
THINK YOU I CARE
WH AAMESAT NRE SHOUTED
IN THE STREETS?
NOTHING IS
MORE IMPORTANT.
YOU ASK ME
TO OPENLY BETRAY A FRIEND.
I CANNOT DO IT.
GOOD NIGHT.
EVERYTHING
WILL BALL RIGHT.
IS HE NOT PERFECT?
PROPER LITTLE SOLDIER.
- Octavia: HE'S SCARED.
- Atia: NONSENSE.
ROMAN MEN
ARE NEVER SCARED.
HE'S JUST SAD
TO BE LEAVING HIS MAMMA.
YOU'RE NOT SCARED,
ARE YOU, OCTAVIAN?
OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT.
TIME FLIES.
GIVE ME A KISS,
MY LOVE.
ANDROS...
BRING HIM BACK SAFE
OR I'LL USE THE EYES
OF YOUR CHILDREN
FOR BEADS.
LYCO, THE HORSE--
NOT TOO EXPENSIVE I HOPE.
I'M SORRY, SIR,
THE HORSE WAS SOLD ALREADY.
- TO ATIA OF THE JULII.
- ATIA?
SHE'S SENDING IT TO GAUL--
A GIFT FOR CAESAR.
DAMN HIM!
MUST HE HAVE EVERYTHING?
AS YOU WERE GOING
TO BE IN GAUL ANYWAY,
I MIGHT KILL
TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE.
LET ME LOOK AT YOU.
AS UGLY AS EVER,
I'M AFRAID.
NOT AT ALL.
AGE SUITS YOU, BRUTUS.
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?
- FIVE YEARS?
- NO, SIX.
OH, HOW CLEVER.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
A PROPER HOUSE.
OH...
I DEEPLY REGRET
YOUR LOSS.
JULIA AND SO FORTH.
HORRIBLE BUSINESS.
CONDOLENCES, REALLY.
NOW TELL ME,
HOW'S YOUR MOTHER?
THE SAME AS EVER.
SHE SENDS HER LOVE,
DEMANDS TO KNOW
WHY YOU HAVEN'T
WRITTEN TO HER IN MONTHS.
I CAN REMEDY THAT
IF YOU'LL BE MY COURIER.
I HAVE SEVERAL LETTERS
TO SEND.
IF I CAN EVER BRING MYSELF
TO GET ON ANOTHER HORSE.
I HAD NO CPTIOONCE
THAT GAUL WAS SO FAR AWAY.
BRUTUS,
ME OLD COCK...
WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU DOING HERE?
MARK ANTONY,
HOW NICE.
I'VE BEEN VISITING
MY COUSIN IN N.
OH? HOW IS THAT IDIOT
COUSIN OF YOURS?
- HE WAS--
- ACTUALLY, I'M SORRY,
I'M IN A BIT OF A RUSH.
I NEED, SAY,
A HALF TALENT OF GOLD.
- DO YOU?
- SEE HOW HE TRUSTS ME.
- FOR THE EAGLE.
- OF COURSE. STRABO!
GIVE HIS HONOR MARK ANTONY
A HALF TALENT OF GOLD.
- A HALF TALENT OF GOLD.
- AND NOT A PENNY MORE.
- DOMINUS.
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU TOLERATE THAT MAN.
HE LIKES TO FIGHT.
THE WAY HE CARRIES ON,
ONE MIGHT THINK HE CAME
FROM NO FAMILY AT ALL.
HE DOES HAVE
A VULGARIAN STREAK.
I DON'T MIND IT.
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT
THE EAGLE?
MY PERSONAL STANDARD
S STOLEN BY BRIGANDS.
A BAD BUSINESS.
THE LEGIONS WERE ALREADY
HOMESICK AND SURLY WHEN
THE EAGLE WAS TAKEN,
NOW THEY'RE
POSITIVELY MUTINOUS.
THE MEN THINK IT'S
A SURE SIGN OF MY DOOM,
AND THEY'RE CLAMORING
LIKE GEESE FOR DISBAND.
THEY DID NOT SEEM
SO UNHAPPY.
WELL, THEY NEVER
FLAUNT THEISCONTENT.
GETS THEM WHIPPED.
I TELL YOU, BRUTUS,
I'M AT MY WITS END.
MASTER OCTAVIAN...
VASIO IS ONLY
A FEW MORE MILES.
DO NOT TOUCH ME
WITHOUT PERMISSION.
WATER.
LUCIORENUS V.
YOU HAVE A BRAIN.
SO THE TRIBUNES SAY.
SO TELL ME,
IF IT WERE YOU WHO HAD
TO RETRIEVE CAESAR'S EAGLE,
HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT IT?
, I'D TAKE CAPTIVES
FROM EVERY TRIBE IN GAUL
AND CRUCIFY THEM
ONE BY ONE
UNTIL SOMEONE TELLS ME
WHERE THE EAGLE IS.
THEN, I WOULD
GO IN QUICK AND QUIET
WITH ONE OR TWO MEN
AND... STEAL IT BACK.
GOOD.
WE ARE OF ONE MIND.
- DO IT.
- DO IT, SIR?
WELL, I BELIEVE THERE'S
A TORTURE DETACHMENT
WITH THE THIRD,
BUT YOU MAY CHOOSE
YOUR OWN MEN IF YOU WISH.
THERE'S
A QUARTER TALENT THERE,
FOR BRIBES AND SUCH.
- SPEND IT WISELY.
- SIR.
NO! PLEASE LET ME DOWN!
LET ME DOWN!
LET ME DOWN! I KNOW--
I KNOW WHERE THE EAGLE IS.
- SPEAK.
- THE BLUE SPANIARDS,
THEY CAME TO STAY
FOR ONE NIGHT...
AND THEN RODE
TO THE CADURCI LANDS.
PLEASE! PLEASE PLEASE.
LET ME DOWN.
CADURCI.
FORTUNE PISSES ON ME.
- PLEASE LET ME DOWN!
- TAKE THEM DOWN.
FORCULUS,
IF YOU BE THE RIGHT GOD
FOR THE BUSINESS HERE,
I CALL ON YOU
TO HELP ME.
IF YOU WILL OPEN
THIS DOOR,
THEN I WILL KILL FOR YOU
A FINE WHITE LAMB,
OR, FAILING THAT,
IF I COULDN'T GET A GOOD ONE
AT A DECT PRICE,
THEN SIX PIGEONS.
THIS, FORCULUS,
I VOW TO YOU.
LEGIONARY TITUS PULLO,
STAND UP.
E RELEASED
TO THE COMMAND OF
SECOND SPEAR CENTURION
LUCIUS VORENUS.
DO YOUR DUTY TO HIS
SATISFACTION, AND YOU'LL BE
SPARED DAMNATION IN THE ARENA.
I WON'T EVEN STAND
NEXT TO THIS SHORT-ASSED SHIT,
LEAVE ALONE SERVE UNDER HIM.
I'LL STAY HERE,
THANKS VERY MUCH.
THESE ORDERS COME DIRECT
FROM HIS EXCELLENCY
MARK ANTONY HIMSELF.
YOU ARE TO RETRIEVE
CAESAR'S EAGLE.
ME, RETRIEVE
CAESAR'S EAGLE?
- BRUTUS?
- MAMMA!
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW GOOD IT IS TO BE HOME.
YOU'RE AS BROWN
AS A BEAN.
IT MAKES ME LOOK
QUITE SOLDIERLY THOUGH.
IT DOES, IT DOES.
- HOW IS COUSIN MARCELLUS?
- TEDIOUS BUT HEALTHY.
- AND CAESAR?
- WHO?
DON'T BE CRUEL.
IS HE WELL?
DID HE ASK OF ME?
DID HE?
I CAN'T RECALL.
I THINK NOT.
HE DID WRITE YOU
A LETTER THOUGH.
OH, YOU BEAST.
Caesar's voice:
"DEAREST SERVILIA,
FORGIVE MY LONG SILENCE.
THESE LAST LONG MONTHS WERE
ALL BLOOD AND IRON AND MUD,
AND NO TIME
FOR LETTERS TO FRIENDS.
BE SURE THAT
I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF YOU
WITH GREAT AFFECTION.
I LONG TO BE TOGETHER
AND ALONE WITH YOU."
"GREAT AFFECTION."
LONGS TO BE ALONE
WITH YOU.
YOU THINK HE SAYS
SUCH THINGS TO HIS WIFE?
"AFFECTION"?
WHAT'S THAT?
HE COULD NOT SAY "LOVE."
WOULU HAVE HIM
PLUCK A HARP?
HE'S A SOLDIER,
NOT A POET.
THE DAY DWINDLES.
OUR GUESTS
WILL BE ARRIVING.
YOU RIDE WELL,
ALMOST AS WELL AS ME.
PULLO, YOU WILL
ADDRESS ME CORRECTLY.
ALMOST AS WELL
AS ME, SIR.
ME, I'M A NATURAL.
MY FATHER WAS A UBIAN PROBABLY.
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO RIDE SO NICE?
PLEASE YOURSELF.
ONLY TRYING TO BE PLEASANT.
MY MOTHER'S PEOPLE
RAISED HORSES IN MUTINA.
MUTINA, NEAR REGGIUM?
UP ROUND THERE?
- UP THERE.
- GOOD COUNTRY.
LISTEN, SIR, THANK YOU,
FOR TAKING ME ON THIS JOB.
- A NOBLE WAY
TO MAKE AMENDS.
- AMENDS?
FOR GETTING ME INTO
THIS CAC BY CALLING ME NAMES.
- THINK NOTHING OF IT.
- NEVER. I WON'T FORGET.
TITUS PULLO
NEVER FORGETS A FAVOR.
- HAH!
- WHAT YOU MEAN, "HAH"?
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OUR CHANCES ARE OF
FINDING THE EAGLE?
LITTLE OR NO CHANCE.
THE EAGLE MIGHT BE ANYWHERE.
BURIED, MELTED DOWN,
SUNK TO BOTTOM OF THE SEA.
WE ARE HUNTING A BLACK DOG
IN THE NIGHT.
AND NOT FINDING THE EAGLE
IS MUCH THE SAME AS LOSING IT.
WE WILL BE DISGRACED.
NOW, I CHOSE YOU
BECAUSE YOU ARE DISGRACED
ALREADY AND CONDEMNED TO DIE.
SO YOU WEREN'T MAKING AMENDS
AT ALL, THEN?
PULLO, IN EFFECT,
YOU'RE DEAD ALREADY.
THE LOSS OF ONE DRUNKEN FOOL
DOES LITTLE DAMAGE
TO THE LEGION.
IF I'M DEAD
ALREADY THEN, SIR,
YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE
HOW YOU SPEAK TO ME.
IF I'VE GOT
NOTHING TO LOSE,
WHAT'S TO STOP ME
CUTTING YOU INTO LITTLE GOBS
AND RIDING OFF, EH?
WHAT'S TO STOP ME, SIR?
WELL, IF YOUR HONOR AS
A SOLDIER OF 13th
ISN'T ENOUGH,
THEN I'LL HAVE TO
RELY ON MY SUPERIOR
FIGHTING SKILLS.
- SUPERIOR FIGHTING SKILLS?
- MMM.
VERY GOOD.
D OF COURSE,
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE
LONG HAIR DOWN TO HERE,
HUGE MOUSTACHES,
THE MOST HORRIFIC STENCH.
THEY EAT ONLY RAW MEAT
AND NEVER WASH.
OH, THEY DO HAVE
ONE ADMIRABLE CUSTOM.
THEY SETTLE
THEIR POLITICAL DISPUTES
BY SINGLE COMBAT
TO THE DEATH.
- EXCELLENT IDEA.
- ISN'T IT?
MOTHER IS ALWAYS NAGGING ME
TO ATTEND POLITICS.
WELL, IT'SN
BEE  OUR FAMILY'S TRADITION
AND DUTY FOR...
IT IS SUCH
DREADFULLY DULL STUFF.
NOW YOU SEE, IF OUR SENATE
CONDUCTED BUSINESS
IN THE GERMAN STYLE,
I SHOULD
CERTAINLY GO AND WATCH.
YEAH, NO TEDIOUS LAWSUITS
AND ENDLESS DEBATES,
JUST SWORDS, DAGGERS--
- MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING.
- BRUTUS, A WORD.
TELL ME,
YOU ARE A GOOD JUDGE.
HOW IS MY DEAR FRIEND
CAESAR?
WELL, HE IS--
HE'S BEEN BETTER,
I THINK.
- MMM?
- MMM.
VERY-- VERY WEARY,
TO BE HONEST.
- A LITTLE DEMORALIZED.
- CAESAR DEMORALIZED?
- NEVER.
- HIS STANDARD WAS STOLEN.
HOW DID HE LET A FOOLISH THING
LIKE THAT HAPPEN?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT HIS MANNER
AND UPROAR ABOUT IT--
YOU KNOW HOW PLEBIANS
CAN BE ABOUT SUCH THINGS--
DESPERATE TO COME HOME,
MUTINOUS.
I HAVE HEARD
THERE WAS SOME DISCONTENT,
BUT MUTINOUS?
HARD TO BELIEVE.
CAN YOU IMAGINE?
AFTER ALL  DON HASHEE
FOR THEM,
HE IS NOT SURE WHETHER
THEY WILL--
WILL FIGHT
FOR HIM ANYMORE.
AND THE LOWER CLASSES HAVE
A VERY VERY CRUDE SENSE
OF LOYALTY.
- NO OFFENSE.
- EH?
I DON'T MEAN YOU.
YOU ARE LOWER CLASS,
BUT THAT IS TO SAY,
THE LOWER CLASS
IN GENERAL, HOWEVER.
A VERY CRUDE SENSE
OF LOYALTY.
EXCUSE ME.
Caesar's voice:
"MY DEAR NIECE,
I HOPE YOU
AND THE CHILDREN ARE WELL.
I HAVE A TASK FOR YOU.
POLICY DICTATES I GIVE
A NEW WIFE TO POMPEY,
BUT I HAVE BEEN
GONE TOO LONG TO KNOW
WHO AMONG THE FEMALES
OF OUR FAMILY
WOULD BE SUITABLE.
I WOULD ASK CALPURNIA,
BUT THOUGH AN EXCELLENT WIFE,
SHE HAS NO EYE
FOR THIS KIND OF BUSINESS.
DO ME THE FAVOR
OF SELECTING WHICHEVER GIRL
YOU THINK
MOST LIKELY TO PLEASE
AND OFFER HER
TO HIM IN MY NAME."
EXCUSE ME,
I WAS FAR AWAY.
CAESAR HAS NO BAD NEWS
FOR YOU, I HOPE.
NO, NOT AT ALL.
NOT AT ALL.
- WHAT A LOVELY PARTY.
- THANK YOU.
NOT AS LOVELY
AS YOU LIN THAT DRESS.
SHH.
AND OCTAVIA--
BEAUTIFUL.
WELL, I TRY.
SHE WILL INSIST
ON SLOUCHING.
WHERE'S OCTAVIAN?
- HE'S IN GAUL.
- OH.
-
-
-
-
GREAT MOTHER SAYS
NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOUR BOY.
GOOD.
TELL ME NOW,
HOW GOES YOUR MARRIAGE?
GLABIUS IS A GOOD MAN.
YOU SURPRISE ME.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WERE
DIFFICULTIES BEN YOU.
MUST YOU ALWAYS HAVE
A NEEDLE IN HAND?
I WAS ONLY ASKING.
EXCUSE MY CURIOSITY.
THERE WAS SOME DIFFICULTIES
IN THE PAST,
BUT WE OVERCAME THEM.
WE LOVE EACH OTHER
VERY MUCH.
WELL, THAT'S A SHAME.
NOW I FEEL BAD.
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE OVERJOYED.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
UNCLE JULIUS
INTENDS TO MARRY YOU
TO POMPEY MAGNUS.
- UNCLE JULIUS INTENDS--
- I KNOW POMPEY IS A TOUCH
LOW IN MANNER,
BUT I'M TOLD H
E'S A PERFECTLY ADEQUATE LOVER.
AND YOU SHALL BE
THE FIRST WOMAN IN ROME.
WE SHALL HAVE TO GET YOU
DIVORCED FROM GLABIUS,
OBVIOUSLY.
QUICK AS POSS.
i will not do it
i love my husband
if u do not divorce glabius, wiLLINGLY,
THEN CAESAR WILL ASK
GLABIUS TO DIVORCE YOU.
- AND GLABIUS WILL REFUSE.
- DOUBTLESS, AND THEN
HE'LL BE KILLED.
AND DOES ANYBODY
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN?
CAESAR WOULD NOT DO THAT.
THE MAN'S BEEN IN GAUL
FOR EIGHT YEARS.
'S PRACTICALLY
A WILD BEAST.
THE MAN HAS TEARS
IN HIS EYES.
TEARS.
HE LOVES ME.
MANISH HUSBAND
IS NO USE TO ANYONE.
AND YOUR SERVANTS!
WHAT A FUSS!
I THINK
YOU FEED THEM TOO MUCH.
A LITTLE MORE ARSENIC,
I THINK, GAIA.
TRY TO LOOK A LITTLE
MORE CHEERFUL, OCTAVIA.
- IT'S FOR THE GOOD
OF THE FAMILY.
- I DON'T CARE.
YOU AND I AND YOUR BROTHER
ARE ALONE IN THE WORLD.
- WE HAVE TO BE STRONG.
- WE ARE NOTLONE A
- CAESAR IS--
- CAESAR IS IN GAUL.
POMPEY IS HERE.
COURAGE, MY LOVE.
THE PARTHIAN
WERE THREATENING
MY LEFT FLANK.
AND SO, RATHER THAN
SHORTEN THE LINE
AS WOULD BE
CONVENTIONAL,
I SENT IN MY CAVALRY RESERVE
AND OUTFLANKED THE FLANKERS.
BRAVO, MAGNUS.
MASTERLY.
IS HE NOT,
OCTAVIA, MASTERLY?
MASTERLY.
Atia:
MAGNUS, TELL ME SOMETHING,
AND BE HONEST.
DOES MY DAUGHTER
PLEASE YOU?
VERYASING,
NO DOUBT.
THEN I CAN TELL YOU
THAT CAESAR,
AS A TOKEN
OF HIS ABIDING FRIENDSHIP,
WOULD LIKE TO OFFER HER
TO YOU IN MARRIAGE.
AH. AHEM.
SHE IS NOT MARRIED
TO YOUNG GLABIUS?
DIVORCED.
AH.
- PERHAPS YOU NEED
TIME TO THINK.
- EXCUSE ME,
I WAS TAKEN UNAWARES.
HOW COULD I REFUSE SUCH
A WORTHY AND DIGNIFIED BRIDE?
- CAESAR IS
FAR TOO GENEROUS.
- EXCELLENT.
WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL NEXT MONTH
FOR AN ACTUAL CEREMONY,
OF COURSE,
WHEN JULIA'S
MOURNING DAYS ARE OVER.
OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
BUT YOU MAY TAKE
YOUR BETROTHAL PRIVILEGES
ANY TIME YOU WISH.
NOW, IF YOU LIKE.
- REALLY, THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
- DON'T BE SILLY.
OCTAVIA WOULD LOVE TO.
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR SHYNESS.
WE'RE ALL FAMILY NOW,
AFTER ALL.
BRITISH WOMEN--
NOW, THAT'S SAVAGE CUNNY.
YOU HAVE TO HUNT THEM DOWN
LIKE DEER.
MIND, ONCE YOU GET THEM
UNDER YOU,
SLACK AS YOUR BEST
NARBO SCORTUM.
DO YOU CARE
FOR NOTHING BUT WOMEN?
WHAT ELSE IS THERE?
FOOD, I SUPPOSE.
YOU DON'T LIKE WOMEN?
OF COURSE I DO.
I'M MARRIED TO ONE.
- I HAVE A WIFE, NIOBE.
- I SEE. CENTURIONS CAN
MARRY THEN?
I RECEIVED
A SPECIAL DISPENSATION.
A SPECIAL DISPENSATION?
SHE MUST BE SOME GOOD...
WOMAN.
SHE IS.
BEEN AWHILE
SINCE YOU'VE SEEN HER THEN.
SEVEN YEARS,
THAT'S HARD.
MAY FORTUNE SMILE ON YOU.
ME, I HAVE SIMPLER TASTES.
I LIKE TO KILL MY ENEMY,
TAKE THEIR GOLD
AND ENJOY THEIR WOMEN.
THAT'S IT.
WHY TIE YOURSELF TO ONE?
WHERE'S THE FLAVOR?
WHERE'S THE JOY?
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU HAD A WOMAN
WHO WASN'T CRYING
OR WANTING PAYMENT?
YOU'RE ON FIRST WATCH.
WAKE ME WHEN THE MOON'S
AT THE ZENITH.
RIGHT YOU ARE, SIR.
Vorenus:
HALT!
HALT!
SONS OF DIS!
THEY WEREN'T
SUCH GOOD HORSES ANYWAY.
MY PEOPLE FOUGHT
AT ZAMA AND MAGNESIA,
MY FATHER RODE WITH SULLA,
AND I'M REDUCED TO THIS--
UNHORSED AND ROBBED
BY CHILDREN.
NICE HORSE.
-
-
LOOK HERE, MARS.
LOOK HERE, MARS.
I AM TITUS PULLO.
THESOODYE BLEN ARE
MY GIFT TO YOU.
THANK E GODS YOU CAME.
I AM EXTREMELY GRATEFUL
TO YOU.
AYE!
LISTEN TO ME. I ORDER YOU
TO RELEASE ME THIS INSTANT.
FINE WAY FOR A SLAVE
TO TALK. YOU WON'T GET FAR
WITH A MOUTH ON YOU.
I'M NO SLAVE.
I'M GAIUS OCTAVIAN
OF THE JULII.
- GREAT-NEPHEW
OF JULIUS CAESAR.
- GAIUS WHO?
I AM A ROMAN CITIZEN
OF NOBLE BIRTH,
AND I ORDER YOU
TO CUT THESE ROPES.
SAY PLEASE.
PLEASE.
BE ASSURED YOU WILL BE
AMPLY REWARDED
FOR YOUR SERVICES TO ME.
SEE HOW GOOD HE TALKS?
HE'S CONVINCING,
I'LL GIVE HIM THAT.
CAESAR WILL PROVE WHO I AM.
TAKE ME TO HIM.
WE CANNOT DO THAT AS YET.
WE HAVE ORDERS.
- WHAT ORDERS?
- WE ARE TO RETRIEVE
CAESAR'S STOLEN EAGLE.
CAESAR WOULDN'T PULL
A HAIR FOR HIS EAGLE.
YOU'RE ON A FOOL'S ERRAND.
IF CAESAR DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT THE EAGLE, WHY DID
HE SEND US TO FIND IT?
IT W LOOOULDSTRANGE
IF HE MADE NO EFFORTS.
ACTUALLY, LOSING THE EAGLE
IS USEFUL TO CAESAR.
WHY WOULD THAT BE
USEFUL TO CAESAR?
BECAUSE POMPEY IS
NO DEEP PHILOSOPHER.
HE WILL TAKE
A SYMBOLIC LOSS
FOR A REAL WEAKNESS.
EXPLAIN.
CAESAR DOESN'T WANT
TO STRIKE THE FIRST BLOW
AGAINST AN OLD FRIEND,
SO HE WISHES TO LURE POMPEY
INTO ATTACKING HIM FIRST.
POMPEY WILL ONLY DO THIS
IF HE BELIEVES CAESAR IS WEAK.
NO. THEY'RE AS GOOD
AS BROTHERS, THOSE TWO.
WHEN JULIA DIED,
THE LAST TRUE BOND
BETWEEN THEM WAS CUT.
CAESAR HAS TAKEN THE LOVE
OF THE COMMON PEOPLE
FROM POMPEY,
AND THAT WAS
HIS MOST PRIZED POSSESSION
A BATTLE IS INEVITABLE.
PULLO.
BLUE SPANIARDS!
GOOD MORNING, UNCLE!
OCTAVIAN?
ONE OF POMPEY'S MEN.
I MISJUDGED HIM.
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD TAKE STRATEGY
TO TURN HIM AGAIME,NST
BUT HE MUST HAVE TURNED
THE MOMENT JULIA DIED.
AND ALL THE WHILE
HE WAS DEFENDING YOU
IN THE SENATE.
-
- HE HAS THE CUNNING
OF A SARDINE, POOR FOOL.
THE BATTLE BEGINS.
ABOUT TIME.
PORCA JUNO.
Caesar's voice:
"DEAREST POMPEY,
I BELIE
THE ENCLOSED MAN
BELONGS TO YOU.
A QUICK NOTE TO TELL YOU
I HAVE DECIDED TO WINTER
THE 13th LEGION
CLOSER TO HOME, AT RAVENNA,
SO I SHALL SOON HAVE
THE PLEASURE OF PAYING YOU
HOMAGE IN PERSON."
-
-
Pompey:
ALL OF YOU, THIS IS
MY NEW WIFE, CORNELIA.
MAYBE IF YOU'D
SUMMONED A LITTLE CHARM
INSTEAD OF MOPING ABOUT
LIKE SOME TORPID OLD SHE-COW,
- THIS WOULD
NEVER HAVE HAPPENED.
- OH, MY DEAR!
EVERYONE KNOWS
IT'S A POLITICAL
REPUDIATION ON ACCOUNT
POMPEY AND CAESAR
ARE ENEMIES NOW.
ONE ONLY HASO LO T
AT CORNELIA.
POOR SAD CHICKEN,
PLUCKED AND BOILED.
MAYBE GLABIUS
WILL TAKE ME BACK.
OH...
WE ARE WELL RID OF HIM.
WE'RE GOING TO FIND YOU
SOMEBODY MUCH MORE WORTHWHILE
THAN GLABIUS.
I'VE BEEN DISHONORED
AND SHAMED BEFORE
THE WHOLE CITY!
NONSENSE!
A GIRL FROM A GOODILY
CAN NEVER BE DISHONORED
A VBYLAINOUS
LITTLE PLEB LIKE POMPEY!
NO...
IT IS I WHO HAS BEEN MADE
TO LOOK FOOLISH.
- IT IS I
WHO HAVE LOST FACE!
- I WANT HIM DEAD.
I WANT HIM DEAD.
AND THAT YOU SHALL HAVE.
POMPEY WILL
EAT SAND FOR THIS.
