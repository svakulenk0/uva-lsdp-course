It has been reported that the
Nazi ﬂeet of U-boats exceeds 500.
Hitter knows how near disaster Britain was
in the last war in 1917
when the U-boat menace all but
strangled our supply lanes on the sea.
We are an island people.
We cannot survive
without our communications across the sea.
Hitler knows this only too well.
These pictures
from another captured German newsreel
bring home with vivid reality the daily
and nightly threat to all our shipping.
That, gentlemen, is what we've got to stop.
It may seem incredible but there is at the
moment one reason why we cannot stop it.
Tirpitz.
Tirpitz is lying 60 miles inland
up a Norwegian fjord
And because of the threat
she constitutes, we
have to keep half a fleet
watching out for her.
Wasted ships, gentlemen.
Ships that we urgently need
to protect our Atlantic convoys.
The Royal Air Force have made
two attacks without success.
The cliffs of the fjord
are so steep that she
might as well be lying
in an air-raid shelter.
Somehow, gentlemen,
Tirpitz has got to be put out of action.
How?
; Human torpedos, sir.
Two men riding across the North Sea
sitting on half a tonne of high explosive?
It's not practical.
Yes, Fraser?
It is practical, sir.
Nobody here seems to realise
how simple such an operation could be.
Hardly
I've got the men, sir.
Give us the machines and we'll put
Tirpitz out of action for you.
You seem very sure of
that, Commander Fraser.
Yes, sir. I'm sure of it.
- Mr Corbett.
- Yes, sir.
Volunteered from shore base, didn't you.
Yes, sir.
- Too much paper and not enough work, eh?
- Yes, sir.
Well, I dare say we can alter that.
- Mr Duffy.
- What's that?
- It's a pullover, sir.
- As worn in the Australian
Navy, I suppose. - No, sir.
Not in this Navy either, Mr Duffy.
Now listen.
just because you volunteered
for special service,
it doesn't mean you can dress up in fancy
clothes like a bunch of fighter pilots.
Remember that.
How old did you say you
were, Mr Abercrombie?
‘19, sir.
- Looking for a bit of excitement?
- Yes, sir.
Well, you won't have to look far in
this outfit. It'll come slap at you.
We were together in the Med, Ramsey,
weren't we?
Yes, sir.
- How's the wife?
- OK now, sir.
- Boy or girl?
- Boy, sir.
Good for you.
Smart.
Are you going to like this
any better than being a steward?
Dunno, sir, yet.
- You'll give us a try, eh?
- Try anything once, sir.
We've served together before, Hutchins,
haven't we?
- Yes, sir.
- Married yet?
- No, sir.
Not found the perfect woman, eh?
- They're all perfect to me, sir.
- Yeah.
Well, keep your mind on the job.
- This job, Hutchins.
- Yes, sir.
No offence to present company
but only an English RN
officer would think of
putting up that, and
filling it with water!
All right, the order of
ascent will be Mr Duffy,
Mister Corbet,
Mr. Abercrombie
- You all right, Ramsey?
- Chief.
- Smart.
- Chief.
- Leading Seaman Hutchins.
- Chief.
Right, class ready.
Now, don't forget, breathe out.
- Good. I'll go and see how they are.
- Yes, sir.
Whoa.
Old Tom marched in
as if he was going to the gallows.
What about you, Digger?
You went green all over.
I feel as if I hadn't spent a penny
since Christmas.
- Cheer up, Ernie. It's all over now.
- Whoo.
Next time I'm coming up your way.
Any casualties?
ALL: No, sir.
We must think up something
else, mustn't we?
Thank you very much, sir.
All right, gentlemen? Now the other arm.
Come on, Stan, push!
- Push.
- I am pushing.
- Nice and comfy, sir?
- Ha, blimey.
- It'll be better when you get in the
water, sir. - Well, it couldn't be worse.
Come on. This could be an emergency.
It is an emergency ,sir.
Right, heads up!
Right?
Push!
- How is it, Stan?
-  Lovely.
- Eh?
" Lovely!"
- Oh.
- Fits you like a glove, boy.
All right, get ‘em aboard.
See any mermaids, Tom?
Yes. Two. But they wouldn't
look at anything under a Commander.
Ah.
- Get a move on, Mr Duffy, sir.
You're next. -
Morale...
..is at its highest level.
What is needed now...
is more machines...
and real agressive action.
Stand to attention!
- Stand them at ease, please.
- Stand at ease.
Now, I want to read you
part of a letter that
I received from the
Admiralty this morning.
With reguards to your request
for aggressive action
to be carried out by the
Mark I Human Torpedo,
it has never been naval policy
to risk life unnecessarily,
with untried and experimental weapons.
The Mark I Human Torpedo
is an unproven machine.
You are reminded, moreover,
that her crew are unproven also.".
And don't look so damn
sorry for yourselves.
You see that?
The Admiralty
oughtn't to write us this sort of a letter,
especially when the Home Fleet's
exercising on our doorstep.
- You all set?
- Yes, sir.
Now listen...
they've got two anti-submarine nets out
and one anti-torpedo.
And watch out for the patrol boat.
- Sounds as if they knew we were coming.
- That's just normal procedure.
Now, I want all charges laid by 2230 hours.
And I want you all in and out by that time.
- All right?
- Yes, sir.
Now, don't forget, you've got to dive
at least a mile from the target.
And it's not going to be easy.
Well?
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
- Er, I suppose they are dummy charges.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Good. Because I'm going to be
sitting right on top of them.
Hey, feeling all right, cobber?
Fine.
Steward's delight, this
is, blowing up Admirals.
- All set?
- Lovely.
Come on.
We'll be there and back
before those boys get through the nets.
The admirals' waiting for you, sir.
I suppose you've come to pester
me about your toy submarine.
Oh, hardly pester, sir.
I don't mind admitting quite frankly
that I'm again ‘em.
Oh, sorry to hear that, sir.
I think you may be proved wrong.
Now you're talking, my boy.
Conjecture and enthusiasm are one thing.
Proofs an entirely
different kettle of fish.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Roll on 12 o'clock.
Lets get turned in.
The Italians have tried them
in the Mediterranean
but they've been
playing about with toy subs for years.
Whereas...
- What's the matter, Fraser?
- Nothing, sir.
- Not boring you, am l?
- Oh, Lord, no, sir.
Then stop fiddling with
that infernal watch.
Oh, sorry, sir.
What exactly did you want to see me about?
Er...
W-W-Well...
N-Nothing in particular, sir.
L-l just wanted your general views
on the tactical uses of the chariots.
I'll be quite blunt.
I don't think they have any tactical use
while they remain an unknown quantity.
- Unproven.
- Yes, sir.
You uh...
- You think I ought to give you proof, sir?
- Undoubtedly.
- What the devil's that?
- The proof, sir.
- Proof?
- Yes, sir.
Those were dummy charges
on the hull of this ship.
If they hadn't been dummies, you'd be
on the bottom now, sir, for the duration.
Damn fine show, Winley. 100%.
I think we've sold it.
It's Mr Abercrombie and Ramsey, sir.
- Aren't they back?
- Yes, sir.
- They all right?
- They will be, sir.
Wouldn't have been so funny if we'd had to
kill a man to get our own way, would it?
Have we got our own way, sir?
Yeah.
.Fraser.
Goodbye-
Sir.
- Smart.
- Yes, sir.
Could I speak to you for a moment, sir?
Well, of course. What's on your mind?
I'm sorry to trouble you so late, sir.
Oh, it's not late.
I've thought about this a lot, sir.
And I thought that if I
could speak to someone...
I'm scared, sir.
- Of diving?
- Yes, sir.
I'm all right, sir, I'm quite all right,
until I feel the water pressing down on me.
And then I sort of panic inside, like.
- I haven't noticed it.
- No, sir.
That's the point, surely.
I haven't noticed it.
- It's still there, sir. And I felt...
- Cigarette?
Oh, thank you very much, sir.
Now, there are two kinds of courage,
aren't there?
One fellow's brave
because he doesn't know what fear is.
The other fellow's brave...
because he's afraid and fights
it and doesn't show it.
Supposing I couldn't fight it, sir?
Supposing we got in a
jam and I lost my head.
There's two of us on them
things, isn't there?
Hm
You're not the only one who's come to me
with this story, you know.
- I'm not, sir?
- Far from it.
You don't think I ought to back out, then?
- Do you want to back out? That's
the real question. - No, sir, I don't.
It... Well...
It sort of facinates me in
spite of being scared stiff.
I tested Cassidy, you know,
with Chief Petty Officer Chubb.
- Yes, sir. I know.
- Frankly, I was scared stiff, too.
Thank you, sir.
Whump. She's a goner.
How's that?
If you put a charge there my boy,
you'll be a genius.
- Right on the captain's backside.
- Attention.
Right, carry on, Chief.
Here he is. Lieutenant Anderson.
Royal Norweigan Naval Reserve
I'm very happy to be here.
He spent the last two years in Norway
and he's got some very interesting things
to tell us.
- Abercrombie.
- Sir.
Well, cheer up.
- Some of us have to stay behind, you know.
- Yes, sir.
Incidentally,
even if you hadn't done that,
I still wouldn't have
sent you on this trip.
You took some pretty big
risks the other night.
Pamsey didn't say anything,
but I can guess.
I tried to get under the net, sir.
- In the deepest part?
- Yes, sir.
- Why?
- Well, we...
I wanted to get in there first, sir.
Damn nearly killed yourself doing it.
- Ramsey, too.
- I know, sir. I'm very sorry.
I'm not organizing a race.
These things are planned operations.
I want a team.
Not a lot of characters
out collecting gongs.
Now, you can kill yourself any time you
like but don't go killing other people.
Pamsey's got a wife and kids.
- All right?
- Yes, sir.
FRASER: Tirpitz
Now, you can see
that she lies a long way inland.
And every yard of it is going to be tricky.
Damn tricky.
There'll be German patrol boats,
shore batteries and all the rest of it.
But your main danger may well be that, in a
flat calm, anyone who looks closely enough
will be able to see the chariot
secured below the water line.
And don't forget,
you'll be sailing in a very small boat.
She's unarmed.
And you're going to go through one of the
best defended stretches of water we know.
The Ingebord will have forged papers
showing that she's a Norwegian ﬁshing boat
on passage from Edoy to Trondheim
with a cargo of peat.
- She's loose.
- Sounds like it.
SMART: Oi!
I think number two's adrift forward.
She's pulling to port.
Can you go down and fix it?
I can try.
I'd better find you some calmer water.
Big wrench. Quick!
Boat approaching!
ANDERSON: German patrol.
Get below.
Get below.
Here, what about Tom?
Leave that to me. Get below.
Hurry!
Sven.
If Mr Corbett tries to
come aboard, stop him.
- It does not matter how, just stop him.
- Ja.
If you hear him, make a noise.
Hammer and keep on hammering.
-
-
Kapitan Erikson.
-
-
The engineer.
Hey!
Well, another 15 minutes.
She's loose again.
Can't tell.
Only 15 minutes.
ANDERSON:
Trondheim‘s on the starboard beam now.
That means Tirpitz.
Less than 10 miles away.
Can you attack in this weather?
- We can attack in any weather.
- It'll be dead calm on the bottom.
Better finish getting dressed.
The less we hang about, the better.
Hey!
Port chariots a goner.
Not even a shackle left.
That means both of them gone.
Starboard snapped clean as a whistle.
Tirpitz is over there.
If it was light, we could see it.
I'd like to get my hands on the blokes
who made those bolts.
Could have reached her easy.
We have no papers for the return voyage.
Then we'll have to scuttle her.
Well, boys, let's go for a walk.
Who's for Sweden?
See anything?
No.
But at this time
they're probably in the guardhouse.
There must be a guard,
so near the frontier.
Ja.
‘Ere, have we got to walk up that?
Ja. Right to the top.
Oh, my poor feet.
- Can't we get moving?
- No, it's not time.
Funny.
I can almost smell ‘em cooking
all those hot dinners down there.
Cor, what I couldn't do
to a ruddy great steak
with onions and chips
and an egg on top.
Whoo.
I'll stand it to you when we get back.
First time ashore.
- Two eggs, Stan?
- It's a deal.
Right, you're on.
I'd say we'll be due for leave
when we get back after this.
Oh, you've got it bad, haven't you?
Well, being married's different somehow.
You're telling me.
I had three years of it.
- Married?
- Yep.
Three years‘ hire.
She gave me me push.
That was bad luck, Duffy.
Well, maybe I chose the wrong girl.
What happened?
I bored her.
Anyway, she found the other boys
more interesting.
- Sorry, Duff.
- I'm not.
Oh, hell, cobber,
you get leave and enjoy yourself.
Pay no attention to Uncle Duffy.
- Who said leave? - Don't tell
me you want to get married, too?
He's got about six wives already.
I wish I had.
You need to lay off
the oatmeal stout and whelks, mate.
Right, It's time we go now.
Where's the actual frontier?
There.
The top of the mountain.
Will the Swedes intern us?
Let us reach Sweden first,
and then worry about that.
Cor, I couldn't half fancy that.
The cook or the cooking?
-  Shoo. Shoo. Good boy.
-
My last. Here.
We go now.
GERMAN SOLDIER: Halt!
Hier, bitte.,
Mit kommen!
Jawohl.
At the next post, I'll drop. You get him.
At the next post, you take the front one.
-
- Here.
Argh!
Quick. There will be others.
Come on, quick!
Right.
- Keep still.
-
Hang on, mate. I want a steak
and chips out of you, remember.
- With two eggs?
- Yeah.
Could you manage a double whack?
What happens?
- I don't know. - Probably stick
us in the nick for the duration.
Anderson.
Him
What did he say?
He says arrangements will be made as soon
as possible to fly us back to Scotland.
- Fly us back to...
- But I...
I thought neutrals were supposed to...
These days no people are neutral.
Well, now that you lot are back from
your winter sports holiday in Sweden,
maybe we can settle down
and get some work done.
Because this time we've got a
real striking power in our hands.
A midget submarine.
You'll attack sitting in it, not on it.
And when l say attack, l mean attack.
The midgets carry four
tonnes of high explosive.
We‘re going to blow such a hole in
Tirpitz, she‘ll never move again.
Quite comfortable down there?
It will be, Chief,
when Smart finds room for his feet.
Sorry about that, sir.
My head's not in your way, is it, sir?
- Diver in position.
- Yeah, about time too.
You're the only one who
can stand up straight.
I could if I was six inches shorter.
- Who's your No.1?
- Abercrombie. He's down here.
- He all right?
- Well, he is at the moment.
But he's a growing lad. I doubt if
we'll get him out in an hour's time.
- Where's that mad Irishman?
- Yeah. No engineer, Chief.
McCleery.
Aye, Chief.
- Hello, right on my barnet!
- Sorry, Ernie, boy.
What's the matter with X3?
- I'll ram ‘em and sink ‘em if they
don't hurry up. - All clear, sir.
- Everybody OK? No.1?
- Aye aye, sir.
- Engine?
- All set, sir.
- Diver?
- Spare a penny for the diver, sir.
Now, that's an idea. How do you
spend a penny in this contraption?
Lower purchase.
Carefully.
Handsomely.
- We don't want to blow the dockyard up.
- No, sir.
Stop purchase.
Right,
- Is it clear now?
- Yeah.
Hey!
- I thought they gave
you three weeks.
- They did. I knew it was
too good to be true.
Nobody gets three weeks
leave out of this navy.
Unless they're too sick to stand up.
- What's new?
- That is.
Why, it's a side cargo.
I've seen it before.
Yes, except that the
others were dummies.
- This isn't.
-
Don't hit it, son. Two tons of
amatol makes an awful big bang.
No amount of hitting will affect it,
but we've heard nasty stories about leaks.
- Leaks in a side cargo?
- Sets it off.
Hey, there's another bit of news, too.
When we do go in,
the old man will lead the attack.
Yes, but when?
- Why muck up our leave?
- Better ask him yourself.
You're early, aren't you?
You weren't due back till 2359.
- Keen, sir. That's us.
- Good, start right away.
- Chubb, give these boys net
cutting practice. - Aye aye, sir.
Cor blimey, what a welcome!
PIANO: J‘ Skye Boat Song
J‘ ..the sailors cry...
What'll you do after the war, Tom?
Just what I was doing before it, I suppose.
Go back into the family business.
Oh, what's that?
- Biscuits.
- Oh, biscuits.
You'll be bored stiff in
peace time after this.
There are worse things than being bored.
Especially if you've got
a wife and children.
What about you?
Me?
I'm going to buy me a little
boat and just sail it.
- Where?
- Anywhere.
Any place where the booze is cheap
and all the girls have got husbands.
Playing
- You know, it's dead funny...
- ‘Ere, what is it?
Um, Deuces Wild, Aces to open.
It's dead funny, you know.
People at home still think I'm a steward.
Ah, poor old Ernie - a hero in disguise.
Well, it's a bit rough, isn't it?
Cor blimey. I'll open and play these.
- What?
- I can't even tell my girl.
I wouldn't worry, Ernie.
- I'll take three.
- Right.
She'll probably pass you up, anyway,
for some lovely big RAF type. With wings.
I'll give him flippin‘ wings if she does,
and a ruddy harp and all.
Come on, what are you going to do?
- I'll bet doubles.
- Don't be reckless.
Company
‘Shun.
Sit down, gentlemen.
I know where you're going, mate.
- Norway.
- Really?
ADMIRAL: The passage across the North Sea
will be made under tow.
His Majesty's submarines
Tiger, Tomahawk and Striker
are detailed for this operation.
The attack will be carried out
by three X-type submarines.
Commander Fraser Royal Navy, In X1,
will take charge of the entire operation.
For the purpose of the attack, X1 will
therefore become flotilla leader.
X2 will be commanded by Lieutenant Duffy,
Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve.
X3 will be commanded by lieutenant Corbett,
Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.
During the North Sea passage, each X-type
submarine will be manned by a passage crew.
The operational! Crews wll rest as much
as possible in
- Ship's head?
- O95, sir.
- Steer O98.
- Steer O98.
Together
- Group down.
- Group down.
- Blowing up a bit, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
We're in the right submarine, then.
I wouldn't be a passage crew
for all the gin in Pompey.
- Depth?
- 7O feet.
- About time for our breath of air,
isn't it? - About half an hour yet.
Cor, what a job.
All the work and none of the glory.
Well, someone's got to do it.
"What did you do in the war, Dad?"
"I was towed across the North Sea."
"Sitting on my um... fat bottom, son."
Oh, ta, sir.
"ANNOUNCEMENT". Check A inboard vent.
Check A inboard vent.
I don't like leaving her behind.
Then take her, Digger.
The order said no personal effects.
Since when have you been
fussy about orders?
All right.
We'll be transferring you to your own craft
about 1800.
All right?
ANNOUNCEMENT:
Diving stations in five minutes time.
Diving stations in five minutes time.
Second coxswain and dinghy party,
muster in the control room.
Second coxswain and dinghy party,
muster in the control room.
- Sir...
- Yes, sir?
What do you reckon they'll give us
for supper - chicken again?
Don't you ever think of
anything except food?
Well, I look at it this way, sir.
Either we get what's coming to us
and then we won't be
bothered by food no more
or else we do the job,
blow Tirpitz sky high,
get nicked by Jerry
and put in a prisoner of war camp.
What's all this about prison camps?
after the attack you'll
be back in this sub.
Stuffing yourself with
I'll believe that when I do it, sir.
- You chaps ready?
CORBETT: Yes, sir.
Down periscope.
If we transfer crews now
while there's a bit of light,
- I can tow you in another four miles.
- Fair enough.
Tell X3 we're surfacing to transfer crews.
Tell X3 we are surfacing
to transfer crews, sir.
I have a feeling those chaps
are going to be glad to see us.
- Stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface.
Diving stations.
- Stand by to surface. Report main vents.
- Report main vents.
Open one, two, three, four,
five and six LP master blowers.
Open one, two, three, four, ﬁve and six.
- Check all LP tank size.
- Check all LP tank size.
What's that funny smell, Dad?
- That's air, son.
- All right.
- All right, stand by to transfer.
- Aye aye, sir.
And about time too.
Give the ruddy Tirpitz an
extra kick from us, eh?
Don't worry. We will.
- Good luck.
- Bye.
Rather you than me.
They've transferred crews all right.
Stand by! There's a ruddy
drift mine caught in the tow.
Hey.
Hold on to your hats.
There's a mine caught in our tow.
My God.
It's a mine! It's fouled the tow rope.
There's a mine on the tow.
Shut all water-tight doors.
I never could stand loud bangs.
ABERCROMBIE: Right, move along, there.
It's all right. You can take out
your ear plugs. She's gone.
- Corbett and Duffy have
transferred crews, sir. - Good.
- Well, we'd better love you and leave you.
- Yes, sir.
- Ship's head?
- 1'05, sir.
- Periscope depth?
- 32 feet, sir.
Up periscope.
Well?
All clear.
Stand by to surface.
- Diving stations.
- Diving stations.
- Check main vents.
- Check main vents.
Signal X1 we're surfacing.
Signal X1 we're surfacing.
Well, thanks for the ride.
- Blow Tirpitz clean out of the water.
- We'll have a go.
We'll be waiting for the bang about dawn.
- Good luck, sir.
- Bye.
Alright, here we go.
- Dive, dive, dive.
- Dive, dive, dive, sir.
- 3O feet.
- 3O feet, sir.
- Full ahead, group down.
- Full ahead.
- Steer 135.
- ‘I35 it is, sir.
- Give me a course for Stjernsund.
- Aye aye, sir.
Trimmed for diving, sir.
Fine.
- Periscope depth?
- Ten feet.
Half ahead, group down.
Half ahead, group down, sir.
FRASER: Time?
- 2227.
- Not bad.
New course will be 128, sir.
FRASER. Steer 128.
- 128 it is, sir.
- Steady as she goes.
- Steady as she goes.
- Half ahead, group down.
- Half ahead, group down.
Depth.
Depth.
Periscope depth now, sir.
CORBETT.
Looks like shore ﬂights. Fine on port bow.
Any ideas, pilot?
Could be this island.
There's a fishing village there.
What do you mean, could be?
Could be Southend Pier.
Definitely not Southend, sir.
Well, boys, we're on our way.
Let's pop in quick, blow her sky high,
and home in time for bed, eh?
Talking.
- Course?
- Course 172, sir.
There's something on the starboard beam.
It's a tanker.
Take her down 40 feet. Flood Q.
Flooding.
Q flooded.
The skipper of the big sub
will be biting his nails when he sees that.
Not allowed to torpedo!
Sounds like a big one, too.
Depth.
Depth,
Oh, for a nice torpedo.
Can't be keeping much of a watch
or they'd have seen us at that range.
The lookout's half asleep, I expect.
I can see the Brattholm Islands now.
Course?
Steer 176.
- Take her down to 3O feet.
- 3O feet, sir.
You're sure we're in the
right fjord, skipper?
I mean, this is dead easy.
You wait.
I said course 107.
Course is 107, sir.
It bloody well isn't, you know.
Brattholm's dead ahead.
Then gyro's off the board, then, sir.
Any idea what's wrong?
No.
I'd better go aft, switch her off
and open her up, sir.
Come on, quickly.
What's the depth here?
Five fathoms. Shingle and mud, sir.
Well, we'll have to sit
on the bottom and wait.
Take her down.
Gently!
Aye aye, sir.
Slow ahead, group down.
- 25 feet, sir.
- Right, stop motor.
Stop motor.
Seems like the chart was right for once.
Emergency lighting, Quick!
Stand by to surface.
Stand by to surface, sir.
Shut main vents.
Main vents shut, sir.
Ready to surface, sir.
Surface.
Any more tea?
Yes, sir.
Just 12 miles over there...
..Tirpitz.
Now you mention it,
I can almost smell the sauerkraut.
Recharge batteries now.
Aye aye, sir.
- Captain.
- All right, sir?
Any movement?
CORBETT: I'm not sure.
Listen!
That's funny. It sounds like music.
Keep still!
Ersatz.
You stay on watch.
I'll get below and get a move on.
Right.
Well, how is it?
Still showing 296, sir.
We know that's wrong.
Couldn't we go in by periscope?
It's only about ten miles.
We could take it slow.
Supposing something goes wrong with it.
We can't sail entirely blind.
- If we surface, that'd give the game away.
- That's it.
On the other hand, we don't know
if the others have even got this far.
We'd look ruddy silly if we turned back
and found out we were the only ones
who had a chance of hitting
All right, then, we'll attack.
It'll mean periscope depth all the way -
unless we get too close to a Jerry ship.
Let's take her up.
All right.
- Dive, dive, dive.
- Dive, dive, dive, sir.
This is it.
- Dive, dive, dive. 3O feet.
- Dive, dive, dive. 3O feet.
Steer 220,
Steer 220, sir.
Steady on 220, sir.
- Let's help you into this.
- Sir.
Periscope depth.
Periscope depth, sir.
Periscope depth now.
Net bouys dead ahead.
Small coaster. Red 45.
Stand by to flood W and D.
- Shut No.2 main vent.
- No. 2 main vent shut, sir.
- Shut No.2 Kingston.
- Shut, sir.
- Slow ahead, group down.
- Slow ahead, group down, sir.
- Slow, group down.
- Slow, group down, sir.
Small coaster dead ahead.
Well, I'm damned!
They're opening the boom for her.
Full ahead, group up!
If we can get through that gate,
it will save us hours of wire cutting.
I'll want 20 feet in a minute.
Any more urge?
Maximum now, sir.
Don't look now, they're closing the boom.
Quick off the mark, aren't they?
Here we go. Take her down 20 feet.
And hang on.
She's not answering, sir.
I've got no control here.
Blimey! We're through!
Do you know, I believe we are.
Periscope depth.
Periscope depth, sir.
Half ahead, group down.
Take her slowly.
- Open No.2 main vent.
- No. 2 main vent open, sir.
- Open No.2 Kingston.
- No. 2 Kingston open, sir.
Depth.
Depth.
- Are you all right?
- Give us a hand.
Nice work, diver. Have a good swim?
Place is lousy with jellyfish.
Periscope depth.
There she is, large as life.
Larger, in fact.
Ah, my beauts, if you
could see what I can see.
We're gonna get her, after all.
Huh?
Flood Q, full ahead, group up, crash dive!
- Full ahead, group up, crash dive.
- Pray, boys.
Periscope gone, sir?
Lucky it wasn't us.
All right, blow Q.
Blow Q, sir. Q blowing, sir.
Bring her up slowly.
Periscope depth. Periscope depth.
Q blown, sir.
Periscope depth now.
Can't see a thing.
We're blind.
- No periscope, no compass.
- Too right we're blind!
What now?
Now we just sit on the bottom and wait.
It's all we can do.
We could bail out.
Not yet we couldn't.
We're so near Tirpitz, we'd only
give the game away for the others.
When we hear that bang, we'll bail out.
Not before.
Yes, sir.
Depth: ten fathoms.
Shingle.
Aye.
OK, slow ahead.
- Group down.
- Slow ahead, group down.
Take her down.
Slowly.
There she is.
It'll be anti-torpedo nets in a minute.
Stand by to dive.
Stand by to dive, sir.
It's hellish shallow about here, sir.
We'll have to risk that.
Any sign of activity?
Not a flicker.
They're all still dreaming
of their fat Frauleins back home.
- AT nets ahead. Take her down.
- Take her down.
- Half ahead, group down.
- Half ahead, group down.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Right, hold her. Keep her like this.
We'll bump under her nets if it splits us.
Flood Q.
Don't let her surface.
Depth charges.
Someones in trouble.
I hope they don't pop off our side cargoes.
You won't have to worry
about much if they do.
We're through.
And that means there's nothing between us
and that juicy great battle wagon.
Now for it.
Can't see a ruddy thing.
Wait a minute.
Yeah!
We've got her.
Slow, group down.
Slow, group down.
Gently. Gently, gently.
Only half an hour more, cobber.
We may have to wait a
little longer than that...
Only half an hour more, cobber.
Till we hear the bang, eh?
Yes, that's an idea. What about a tune?
Only wish I could.
Jerry‘d pick it up?
They might get a little suspicious
if they heard a dirty British song
coming up through their deck plates.
- Are we as near as that, then?
- Sure.
That's it!
Depth charge.
Probably just a routine operation,
nothing to do with our boys at all.
Side cargo makes a bigger bang than that.
Full astern, group down.
Ship not moving astern.
Full ahead, group down. Trim up.
- Hard aport.
- Full ahead, group down, trim up!
Hard aport, sir.
Shut one main vent.
- Blow one main ballast.
- One main ballast blowing, sir.
One main ballast blown, sir.
No ruddy good.
Full astern, group up.
That's done it, sir.
Take her down, take her down!
- Open 1 main vent.
- 1 main vent open, sir.
She won't go down.
The net must have fouled the hydroplanes.
Flood Q, flood main ballast.
Q flooded. Main ballast flooding, sir.
- Keep her steady.
- Steady.
- Stop motor.
- Stop motor.
That's her.
Set both side caegos for half an hour.
Set both side caegos for half an hour, sir.
Both side cargoes set 3O minutes.
- Release both.
- Release both.
Both side cargos released, sir.
Well, let's get the hell
out of here, shall we?
It's no good, skipper.
She won't dance, sir.
What's our depth?
She's on her side.
All right, then. We'll go on in as we are.
- Half ahead, group down.
- Half ahead, group down.
Stand by for the bump.
Getting stuffy, isn't it?
You can breathe.
What are you worrying about?
She's moving, isn't she?
She can't be. She's still on the bottom.
Seemed to me she... keeled over a bit.
Well, she didn't.
Ja!
Achtung!
- Course?
- O55, sir.
- Keep her right there.
- Aye aye, sir.
Motor's stopped, sir.
-
- What about it?
- Shafts either bent
or broken, sir.
- I thought things were going too well.
Keep trying.
There she is. Stop motor.
Stop motor.
Set side cargoes for 3O minutes.
Set side cargoes 3O minutes.
Both side cargoes set 3O minutes.
Let ‘em go.
Side cargo's gone, sir.
Well, there's no point in hanging around.
Nein, nein, nein.
Slow astern, group down.
Full astern, group down.
Full astern, group up!
- Stop motor.
- Stop motor.
OK, boys, blow all main ballast.
We are surfacing.
- Blow all main ballast?
- Surfacing?
Well, we've done our job.
With no hydroplanes and stuck under Tirpitz
we've had it. We'll bail out and scuttle.
- All main vents shut, sir.
- Blow all main ballast.
Blow main ballast.
She's not moving.
- No good?
- She won't budge, sir.
- Take this out and have a look.
- Aye aye, sir.
Don't get your feet wet.
Flood him out.
- Dry him out.
- Aye aye, sir.
What's the hell's that?
No wonder she won't move.
We're stuck underneath her keel.
And it looks like the tide's going out.
- She's settling down on us all the time.
- What?
I've got better than that. We're on
top of eight tons of high explosive.
Eight?
DSEAs, quick!
Shall I flood W and D, sir?
Hell, no. Flood the whole chute.
- Hatch lever jammed.
- Got a battleship on it, that's why.
Get ready to bail out.
- Well, keep trying.
- No good, sir. We've had it.
- Depth?
- 15 feet, sir.
- She's rising. Flood Q.
- Flood Q, sir.
All the tanks are full, sir.
Can't hold her.
Any drift?
If the jar is not busted,
we've swung round and back towards Tirpitz.
That would be lovely.
Right back on top of our own side cargoes.
Still rising, sir.
- No sign of any of the others.
- No.
What goods he supposed to be?
They think we were using limpets.
He'll have a headache if he's down
there when those charges go off.
-
- Don't be like that.
Another half hour should
see us out of here.
- She's floating.
- No, she isn't.
- It's the side cargo. It's flooding.
- Not necessarily.
- Couldn't be anything else.
- It might be a tide or a strong current.
There's one way of finding out.
- Start the motor.
- Aye aye, sir.
- We're surfacing, sir?
- No, we're not.
- Take it up ten feet when you can.
- Ten feet, sir.
- Slow ahead, group down.
- Slow ahead...
..group down.
Amt-swan.
I knew it. Side cargos flooded.
That's why it keeled over.
- We're not bailing out.
- But it will blow up.
We're not giving the game away. All right?
- They must have got in by now, sir.
- We can't be sure.
One peep out of us
and the whole attack could fail.
- All right. Stop motor.
- Stop motor, sir.
Ten feet now.
Going up. Ironmongery and hardware.
Seven feet now, sir.
I can't hold her.
- All right, stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface, sir.
- Can you blow any tanks?
- Only number two, sir. Now?
Right,
. Right, at.
- Good grief! Look at her.
-
Wm?
Cor blimey!
They got the ruddy cooks on that gun.
Stand by to bail out.
Might as well be shot as drowned I suppose.
Bail out!
They're picking them up.
Hello. Here comes the executioner.
Hans!
Schnapps.
Cor blimey! Here you are, skip, have a tot.
Quite a tea party. What happened?
We got stuck under this hulk.
Park yours all right, sir?
Yep. Dead under number one engine room.
And you?
- Right on top of yours.
- Ought to be quite a bang.
So they got eight tons of amatol
underneath them.
- What are they gonna do about it?
- They're getting up steam.
- Yes, sir.
- Hell.
- No sign of Duffy?
- No, sir.
- Still flooding?
- Can't tell.
There's no more list.
They don't always explode when they flood.
Yes they bloody well do and we all know it.
- I'm all right.
- Sure you're all right.
Nein, nein, nein.
They've only got to move it
a few feet to one side.
- They don't know that.
- Yet.
Let's stall it.
- You, sir, command this party?
- No.
Are you in charge of this party?
- Excuse me?
- Are you commander of this party?
Oh, yes... Yes, I am.
We wish to know immediately what
kind of charge have you employed.
I beg your pardon?
We want to know what kind of explosives
you have used.
Yes, I'm sure you do.
You realise that you are in danger with us.
- Do you realise that, Corbett?
- No, sir, I didn't.
What's the time?
- Ten minutes to, sir.
- Yes, we do.
Now listen, all of you.
You'll be sent to prison camp, in any case.
If you tell us the nature and position
of your explosives,
we can make things easier for you.
Eight minutes to go, sir.
They must move her. They're not crazy.
Here. Do you think we could move along
the deck a bit?
Not a chance. Why?
I reckon we're plum on top of the charges,
that's all.
- What's the matter? You tired of swimming?
-
- Engines. Feel them?
- Yeah.
Five minutes.
They must get her moving.
I wish to hell we had used limpets.
Three minutes.
She's moving.
- No, she's not.
- Props are turning, anyway.
Tight.
Flood her up - number one. Open everything.
Oh, what a lovely bang!
That must have broken her back.
- She won't move from here in this war.
- Hey, look. It's given me a nosebleed.
- You think they heard that in
Whitehall, sir? -
flooded.
I hope he's got a smashing sense of humor.
Achtung!
The Captain says you are brave men.
He salutes you.
Thank you, sir.
Right
