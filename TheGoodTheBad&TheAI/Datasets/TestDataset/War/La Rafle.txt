All events in this film,
even the most extreme,
truly occurred in Summer 1942.
No Jews - By Order
Hi, Raymond.
Weismann.
What are you doing there?
Can I go to school with you?
The star, is that right?
What's the problem?
We're Jewish, aren't we?
And proud of it, too!
Come on.
How about that!
They seemed like such good kids.
At least now
we won't get them mixed up.
Field Marshal,
here we are!
Facing you, the savior of France
We swear, we're your men
We're here to serve and follow you
You could've waited for me.
Mum insisted on walking
my brother and me to school.
You've given us new hope
The nation will be reborn
Field Marshal, here we are!
Right, the first one of you
to mention that blasted star
gets his arse kicked.
Clear?
Yes, sir!
File in, two by two.
In silence, please!
C'mon, lads.
When surgery can do nothing,
as with the faces
of these Great War vets,
a facial prosthesis can be fitted.
This technique...
Stand up, ladies!
Please sit down.
Now then, ladies...
You may have been told that Jews
have pointy ears, hooked noses
and goodness knows what else...
Curtains, please.
As you can see, your fellow students
look just like you.
That's why
you will help Esther and Sarah
to escape through the courtyard
if the Germans arrive.
I'm relying on you.
Thank you, ladies.
Vichy, unoccupied France
How many did you say?
Foreigners, most of them.
Even so, that's rather a lot.
How many Israelites
do we have in our own camps?
is that they're foreign Jews.
If the Germans
take back the scum
that's fled here since '33,
I've no objection.
Neither do I, obviously.
But...
Offer them to the Germans, though.
I have.
Just in Paris,
over half the Israelites
are French nationals.
Not to mention their children,
all born in France.
The Germans
won't take the children.
Won't they?
Not for now.
What are we supposed
to do with them?
- Hello, Violette.
- Hello, children.
- You coming, Simon?
- Yes.
- Hi, Tati!
- The terrible twosome's back!
Hands off my radio, you!
Don't worry.
Evening, Ida.
- Good evening, children.
- Evening, Captain.
Hi there.
How's my little tiger?
Hi, Mum.
You're all sweaty.
Look...
Top of the class again.
What have you forgotten, Simon?
Can I go with him, Mum?
Please, can I?
Don't be late.
School's not finished.
- Okay. Thanks.
- You have homework to do.
- Hi, Dad.
- Don't forget my tobacco!
Don't worry.
That was André Claveau
and his Orchestra.
Now the racing results.
At Auteuil, the Princes' Handicap
was won by Isaac.
The horse's name,
not the jockey's, of course.
Now they wear yellow stars,
it's a shock
to see Paris crawling with Jews.
Hard-working Jews!
In Montmartre,
I counted 268 yellow stars.
A victim of its own generosity,
France has been swamped.
Sura!
Which means?
Explode with an onion up your arse!
That's the third time this week.
Put a sock in it!
We have a job for you.
What kind? Hope it's nothing like
the last one...
When a viscount
meets another viscount
What do they say?
"Viscount, how are you today?"
When a marquis
meets another marquis
What do they say?
"Marquis, how are you today?"
Come on, Nono, let's go!
It's just some little Jewish scamps.
Wait for me, lads!
Don't be so mean!
- Tomorrow, we'll try a posh area.
- What's "posh"?
Rich, you mug.
The rich leave a long stub.
We'll visit the Eiffel Tower,
at last.
What's that?
Remember that exhibition?
"The Jews in France"?
What a load of shit!
It's not even scientific.
- Looking at your profile...
- What about my profile?
It makes you wonder.
Very funny.
What was that stink at the bistro?
Their sauerkraut.
It's chock-full of pork.
Germans don't eat kosher?
It's dark in here!
We'll die of suffocation!
I'm late for my customers.
Who are they for?
The Traubes.
Some people have such lovely things.
Look at Renée's blouse!
Hands off, you!
Titanic's on at the Gaumont.
You know Hitler blames
the Titanic sinking on us?
Really?
Iceberg.
Another damn Jew!
- How can you joke about it?
- Rachel, my girl...
Read me Gone With The Wind
instead of grumbling.
Rachel!
You'll only cry again.
It's good to cry
if it's not for real.
I've got a head this big
and I hate Jews.
Jews won't be laughing for long.
With this prophecy,
I will have the last word.
They will disappear
from the face of the earth,
annihilated and obliterated!
We must hurry, Himmler.
Before the international community
starts an outcry.
Have you read Sun Tzu?
The Art of War.
Remind me to give it to you.
Everything is taking place
as I described in Mein Kampf.
Page 771, mein Führer.
They must learn
to take me at my word.
Mr. Jacques first, by the church.
We've done him.
And those loaves...
Go on, scram!
This isn't a circus!
It's a respectable business!
Why doesn't the baker want Jews
in her shop?
Because she only likes barb-aryans!
- What's going on?
- Get lost!
Thank you!
Pancakes, yummy!
Simon!
Hello, Father.
Hello, boys.
The Nazis and collaborators
forget something.
Why did you call him "father",
the man in black?
What's that?
Their Christ was a Jew!
- You're joking?
- He was some kind of rabbi.
And they don't know?
Why'd you call that man "father"?
If he came back today,
their Christ,
he'd be wearing a star.
Blow me down!
The man in black isn't your father.
And that's all!
It's too premature.
You promised
to hand over your Jews.
I promised nothing.
- I said...
- What's wrong, Bousquet?
- I said I'd talk to my superiors.
- That's a joke.
Don't let your resolve weaken
so close to our goal.
Must we bring troops from the front
to do the job ourselves?
You couldn't!
- You imagine refusing?
- I didn't say that.
- 100,000 Jews is too many.
- 20,000 isn't enough.
The Führer would not understand
if you refused to cooperate.
He'd interpret it as provocation.
An insult.
Look,
you empty it out like this.
Careful you don't make a mess.
Sura, did you see my rolling papers?
No, that's not the tobacco.
It's the solvents, the paint.
My papers, darling?
In the dresser.
In the drawer.
On the right.
The second one.
You don't even know
who smoked them.
What if he had tuberculosis?
No danger of that.
I pinched them off some Germans.
- Great big fellas, they were.
- Bastards are fighting fit!
I hope they all rot from cholera.
Can I practice now?
Can I? My audition's on Monday.
Can I start?
I don't think Shabbat's ended.
One...
two, three...
Three stars, Sura.
Shabbat's ended.
Don't you believe me?
No.
Jo...
Come over here.
It's true, Mum, honest.
Go on, put your ballet shoes on.
Five police training schools.
I know what's coming.
Our government must reassert itself.
We need new training schools.
No more paramilitary police.
- No more Police for Jewish Affairs.
- Darquier'll be pleased.
His militiamen are exemplary.
They're thugs.
- Rabble.
- Who do the dirty work.
They don't have the file of Jews.
We have it.
Can't you change the music?
I like Chopin.
He was Jewish, wasn't he?
Sura, not all geniuses are Jews.
I'll get you!
Stop that.
I have a suggestion.
We organize everything.
But you restore
our police's authority.
If all goes to plan,
I promise
the Führer will listen favorably.
Vanda Lesniak.
Sarah Landeau.
Annette Monod.
Lucienne Dufresnes.
Goodbye!
Have a good holiday!
Look, Mum, I won the prize!
That's wonderful, love.
What's wrong?
Come on, let's go home.
We'll pay for private lessons
with Prof. Grunstein.
He's banned, too.
That way, you keep your teacher.
Dad, private lessons are expensive!
So? I'm not a cripple, am I?
Listen and remember this forever.
They can ban you,
but they can't ban your talent.
The war will end one day.
All wars do.
- We must leave right now.
- And go where?
The Ritz?
They're dismissing Jews
from universities,
the civil service...
Everywhere, Dad.
The nursery school head...
she's been fired.
Have you read the papers?
Have you seen what they call us?
"Undesirables". That's what.
What more do you need?
How can 5 of us get out?
How can we cross the border?
With what money?
Mr. Finkel and his wife
tried to make it to Spain.
Now where are they?
At Drancy internment camp.
You want that?
Do you?
"9th decree of 8th July, 1942,
"concerning measures
against the Jews.
"It is forbidden for Jews to frequent
establishments open to the public. "
What does that mean?
I'll tell you what it means.
We're banned from cafés,
restaurants,
concerts, libraries,
fairgrounds...
They should say where we can go.
It'd save ink.
What do you think?
I preferred things
the way they were.
"Restrictions on entering
shops and businesses... "
Honestly, Laval, you've read it too.
"France is not yet
sufficiently anti-Semitic
"to accept
the mass deportation of Jews. "
Who wrote this report?
- The secret services.
- I always said...
France isn't ready.
Police stations are swamped
with denunciations. Overrun.
We can't deport French-born Jews.
The country won't accept it.
Let's turn it to our advantage.
We'll deport the stateless ones.
Personally, I'd feel no dishonor
in deporting them
to Germany's territories for Jews
in the East.
In the East?
East of what?
Any mass deportation
would cost me power.
I see.
I'll deliver your answer in person.
In the negative.
I knew we'd reach agreement.
Let's recapitulate.
You start by sending us 10,000 Jews
from your camps
in the southern zone.
In the occupied zone,
your police do the job...
Under French command.
That's the quota.
Only stateless persons
will be arrested. Austrians, Czechs,
Russians, Germans and Poles.
We'll leave you
the children until...
Impossible!
Our social services couldn't cope.
Children should go
with their parents.
We'll have to refer that to Berlin.
No Jews - By Order
Just watch what happens.
I knew it.
You should know the law.
You, too.
You have children here?
Of course.
Count yourselves lucky
I don't arrest you.
People end up in Drancy for less.
And don't forget,
curfew for Israelites at 8 PM.
I don't make the law.
Boys!
Nono, we're going.
You're going already?
I'm going to have a baby.
Your Mummy is.
You'll have a brother or sister.
No, it'll be a baby.
The doctor said so!
Nowadays,
you don't want to be having babies.
If these ladies are going,
so are we. Lucien?
It's silly that you have to leave.
It's outrageous,
how they treat you.
My husband made it to the free zone.
But I've had no news in 2 weeks.
I don't know how you do it,
all alone with four children.
Are you the new tenants?
We just moved in next door.
We're from the Marne.
My husband works
at Les Halles market.
Shall we go for coffee?
Aren't you forgetting something?
Afternoon, Mrs. Traube.
Good afternoon, Sura.
Ladies.
I have some laundry for you
to come and pick up.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, sir.
You're not in school today?
Not any more,
like all Jewish teachers.
I give German lessons
to students now.
Enjoy your walk.
Thank you.
What?
What what?
What were you laughing at?
I wasn't laughing.
Hark at him.
In the end,
it's proving easier with the French
than the Duce
or that blasted Franco.
Film the young people, not me.
You're much younger than them.
Spain fights
for every one of its Jews.
Mediterraneans,
so over-emotional!
Romantics.
That's why we dominate them.
Herr Hitler, can we go
and see the deer?
Of course you can, sweetheart.
We'll give them
some bread soaked in milk.
Fast and with utmost discretion.
Night and fog.
A total of 5000 men.
Including 4,500 gendarmes,
Mr. Secretary General,
and 200 plain-clothes
secret servicemen.
Not forgetting 1000 militiamen,
all highly motivated.
If my calculations are correct,
that's one armed man
for every four or five Jews.
We should net 24-25000.
Of whom three-quarters are women,
children and pensioners.
That shouldn't be any problem.
To reach the quota you set,
we'll have to strip a few thousand
of French citizenship.
Isn't that so, Leguay?
So it looks legal, we only arrest
foreigners or stateless persons.
We're taking care of it.
Let's say the 14th of July.
Be serious. It's our
national holiday, Bastille Day.
In that case, the 16th.
They've got out
the file of the Jews.
Evening, Tati.
Evening, son.
Thousands of people listed.
It'll be any time now.
It's nice of you to warn us, Dédé.
Give my love to Momone!
I heard they'll take children
this time.
You're mad, my girl!
Schmuel,
tell your daughter she's mad.
Children?
Why'd they burden themselves
with children?
Sergeant Desnoyers
came specially to warn everybody.
You're talking nonsense, my girl.
Thousands of Jews
took refuge here like us.
Know what they say in Poland?
France is the Jews' salvation.
- Dad, we mustn't stay here tonight!
- It'll be like last time.
When was that false alarm?
If it makes you feel better,
I'll sleep in the workshop.
We're in danger, too!
Stop it, Rachel!
You'll scare your brother.
They want men
for their arms factories.
They won't touch us.
And your father's a war veteran.
I'll sleep downstairs,
for Rachel's sake.
Have you seen my cigarettes?
You just want to smoke in bed.
What bed?
There's just a rotten couch.
Full of fleas!
- Why didn't we go to America?
- They turn back communists.
You can go later. I prefer Paris.
Every day, I go to the Sacré Coeur
for my models,
and every time,
I feel my heart skipping.
Compared to Lublin,
France is a dreamland.
You never saw what Poland was like.
We could tell you stories.
Pétain's no Cossack,
whatever you say.
It could be a rumor,
but you never know.
Here's what we'll do...
If I hear them,
I'll come calling my cat.
Tati, you don't have a cat.
What a sweetie!
He's a bright one, isn't he?
Why did she say
she'd come calling her cat?
The cat's make-believe.
Try to delay them,
so we can get out the back.
- Goodnight, Bella.
- Goodnight, Tati.
Mum?
Yes?
I have an idea.
What's your idea?
We should get married.
What do we do with Dad?
We'll invite him.
Goodnight, darling.
You can finish tomorrow.
You'll teach me
to speak French good?
Right now?
No, I'm having lots of work to do.
I have.
I have lots of work to do.
Make fun of me.
Goodnight, darling.
What does that mean?
My little Yiddish noggin,
I think you'd say.
You're my little Yiddish noggin.
Goodnight, Mum.
To all Divisional Chiefs,
you will arrive
at the first address at 4 AM.
All listed Jews
must leave their homes immediately.
You will proceed swiftly
without needless chatter.
The ethics of the operation
are not to be debated.
All arrestees will be taken
to the primary detention centre,
whatever their state of health
or age.
Gas and electricity meters
will be shut off.
Pets will be given to the concierge,
with tenants' keys.
Arrestees must be in possession
of identity cards.
Each detainee is allowed one pair
of shoes, two pairs of socks,
two shirts, two pairs of underwear,
a sweater, a set of sheets,
a bowl, a cup, blankets...
Razors are permitted.
Moreover, detainees must take
two days' food per person.
You will send childless couples
and bachelors to Drancy camp.
All the others
to the Winter Velodrome.
Kitty! Kitty!
They're here! They're coming!
They're coming! Wake up!
I'll report you!
There are only poor folk here.
They haven't done anything!
Stay out of this! Back inside!
Go!
That's an order!
The children too?
- Mum!
- The children!
Stop! Don't hurt her!
They're taking the children too!
The children!
- Quiet!
- Run!
Stop!
They're taking the children!
Open up, now!
Run!
It's the Zyglers.
Don't hurt her!
Stop hurting her!
- Vladimir, please take the children.
- You too, Ida.
I can't leave my husband.
Children, don't make a noise.
I'll see you soon.
Where are you going?
Taking my brother to his nanny's.
- Name?
- Louise Timonier.
We just moved in.
What are you doing?
Let's go!
What are you doing here?
I told you to keep out.
They're Jews.
Mummy!
Thanks anyway.
Get the hell out!
I'm missing two from my list.
Louise and Léon.
Where are they, ma'am?
Do you honestly
expect me to tell you?
I won't leave!
This is my home.
Your name!
He fought in the Great War!
His Jewish comrades died for France!
How dare you?
Those are my children!
Murderers!
Excellent.
Only four suicides so far, sir.
And almost no fighting.
Yes, but how many have we got?
What time is it?
- I said, how many?
- 5000.
We're below target. Look lively!
Ida...
Get your paws off me!
Idiot!
Open up. Police!
Open it or we'll blow the lock off.
What are you doing?
A madwoman jumped with her brat.
I don't want an epidemic.
My God!
Who was it?
We know everyone here.
Who cares, they're dead.
Right, how many Jews here?
We've got five.
Sura, Charlotte, Rachel,
Joseph and...
Stupid dago name.
Schmuel Weismann.
- He isn't here.
- Where is he?
Deceased.
It doesn't say so here, ma'am.
Last week.
Embolism.
Just to repeat myself, you're allowed
Hurry up!
Girls, help me!
Take warm clothes,
they'll come in handy.
Where are you taking us?
Chop chop!
Get some crockery.
Nothing breakable.
No need, you'll get them there.
Forget that, too.
You won't need it there.
Where's "there"?
Why won't you tell us?
I don't know
and I don't give a damn!
Quick or I'll get the Gestapo.
You'll change your tune.
Don't try to escape,
we have orders to shoot.
Move!
For Poor Relief.
Shouldn't we tell Dad?
That's an idea I like.
So, not a widow after all?
Hubby's embolism all cured?
Get the champagne!
What's embolism, Mum?
It's okay, Jo. You didn't know.
Gently, please!
She got out of hospital yesterday.
You think they'll hurt my teddy?
They can't. It's a toy.
I don't understand.
Are you okay, Mum?
- Are you sure?
- Not a word.
Otherwise, they won't let me
come with you. Not a word.
- Your papers!
- Leave it, Momo, she's new.
Mona, make any cash last night?
Want a jar at René's?
Yeah, sure...
This strip of a girl? A prossie?
With a sprog and no tits?
As if you don't know
how twisted you men are.
Come on, Mona, let's have a drink.
I know where we'll hide her.
You're the Zygler girl, aren't you?
We'll take her to Father Bernard.
And Professor Traube, where's he?
At Collège St. Vincent,
with his students.
He's an early riser for a teacher!
Those kicked out of their schools
have no choice.
Remind me
to send a van to St. Vincent.
We have a Jew to pick up.
One Saul Traube.
You have ten minutes.
Food for two days,
one small suitcase.
You understand French, don't you?
- I have my orders.
- Not orders to peep, though.
Run up to the attic and hide.
- What are you going to do?
- Warn Dad.
I've got to beat them there.
Take your coats.
They'll think you left.
I'll try to delay them.
Go on!
The little bitch!
Check upstairs.
Stop it!
Not so proud now, eh?
- Good riddance, I say.
- Shut up!
What'd these kids do to you?
Where are they taking them?
Jerusalem!
Death to Jewish vermin!
I'm not vermin!
Die!
Look, Mum, it's Jo!
Mum, grab him!
- We can keep him.
- I'm not allowed to.
Goodbye, HéIène.
- That's enough.
- Goodbye, Sura.
Goodbye, Jo.
If anyone escapes,
hostages will be chosen at random
and shot.
Is that clear?
I'm sorry, Dad.
Sorry for what, son?
Isn’t it better,
the whole family together?
I'm a war veteran.
I want to know where we're going.
- Are we leaving France?
- On my word as an officer, no.
I believe you.
Let's face facts, we've failed.
With all due respect, sir,
you call that a failure?
A mere 10,000 Jews missing!
They had accomplices.
To arrest more Jews,
we'll have to search Aryan homes.
From now on,
you must never say your old name,
nor your little brother's
nor other family members' names.
You must forget
your old address, your school,
your classmates...
You must change your date of birth,
your religion and everything else.
Do you see?
It's a question of life or death.
Thank you.
I know what you risk.
To fight Hitler
is to fight the Antichrist.
Excuse me,
the Winter Velodrome, please?
The senior doctor's expecting me.
I'm looking
for the consultations room.
- Who are you?
- Annette Monod.
Let go of my wife!
Miss! Our son has a bad fever.
I won't be a moment.
Can you tell us our new address?
Our children might worry.
We've been without water for 2 days.
Please, do something.
I'll be right back.
Where are we going?
My daughter has measles.
I won't be a moment.
Are you alone?
I beg your pardon?
I asked for reinforcements.
I'm sorry.
What's your name?
I only have 6 nurses,
including you, for 8000 people.
Ask Matthey Joanis at the nursery
what you can do.
Do you know if doctors are coming?
No.
I have 60 volunteers ready,
but they want no witnesses.
They dragged Jews from hospitals,
old folks' homes,
asylums even.
We have lunatics here.
Appendicitis cases
who'd just been operated on.
And the usual children's diseases.
Measles,
scarlet fever, chicken pox...
Typhoid even.
I never saw chaos like this.
And in the pharmacy?
Methylene blue.
And two stoves to sterilize syringes.
On the front in '14, it was better.
- You were there?
- Ambulances at Verdun.
I lost my eye there.
But the other misses nothing.
Where do I begin?
We just received some milk.
Under-4s only.
There's not enough to go round.
I've been a good boy.
I'm sure you have.
My teacher said so.
I believe you.
Why can't I leave then,
if I've been a good boy?
I've no idea, little man.
I don't know why you're here.
We need to tell Mummy
we're waiting here for her,
me and Simon.
We live at number 12.
Number 12, fine. I'll remember.
You have family here?
Yes, my brother's outside.
What's your name?
Noé Zygler,
but you can call me Nono.
Okay.
That boy's mother
died this morning.
A hemorrhage.
Poor woman died
on the way to hospital.
The boys don't know.
Which is your brother?
I am.
- Is your father here?
- He's in the free zone.
At least, I think so.
My big sister
and little brother got away.
You two are all alone here?
We're here. Their neighbors.
They're with us.
Look, Mummy gave it to me
before she went to hospital.
There's her photo inside.
Your Mummy's very pretty.
When does it begin?
What, darling?
The show. The bicycle race.
We're the only show here, Nono.
- Where are you going?
- The Red Cross. Can you help?
- Depends.
- Leave me alone!
You're trying to get out?
Are you alone here? No family?
Nobody?
Go and see the chief plumber,
Roques.
He has blank permits, Ausweis.
He can help you.
Go on.
I didn't tell you.
He can help you, too.
Why don't you ask him?
Who'd look after them?
Come on in, madam.
A fine case of chicken pox.
I never saw so many Jews.
How can they hurt us?
There's too many of us.
It's too much work.
Why are we here then?
I know where we're going.
We're going to Pitchipoi!
Where's Pitchipoi?
Near Timbuktu.
Why's everything you all say
so confusing?
I heard we're being sent
to the arms factories in Poland.
There aren't any in Poland.
But there are salt mines.
I saw them when I was a kid.
You get on a little train
and go underground.
And you know what the workers
built in the salt? Do you?
Do you know?
What about you?
A cathedral. A real one.
In the salt.
With candelabra and pews.
We can build a synagogue then.
The doctor sent me.
You're the chief plumber?
Yeah.
I won't shake your hand.
- Who's it for?
- Me.
- It'll never work.
- Why not?
We got two Jews out today.
Two men, in our overalls.
With your figure...
They're not that stupid!
Give me the Ausweis anyway.
In my top pocket.
Take the pen out, too.
How do you spell your name?
Roques, with an S.
If anyone asks, say I'm your wife.
I can cope with that.
- Does that look okay?
- Let's hope so.
Now it's got my name on it.
Thanks.
And good luck.
Say it to them.
I brought my husband his lunch.
He's the chief plumber.
I'll go with you, just in case.
Hold on.
How do I look?
Full of nerve.
Let's go.
Not him!
- Who is he?
- He knows I'm Jewish.
Miss!
Well played.
Quick, before he changes his mind.
Little girl.
Thanks.
Here.
I told you.
Why'd no one listen to me?
Rachel, please, not in public.
You're always so trusting.
It's all your fault.
A father protects his family!
Rachel, be quiet.
Look around you.
I wasn't the only one.
We all trusted them.
Your father's right.
We all trusted them, all of us.
You're Protestant?
A pastor's daughter.
- Practicing?
- Yes.
I still believe.
I wanted to say...
I'd no idea what was going on here.
I never imagined this.
They gave you
no special instructions
before they sent you here?
Sure.
So, what were
their recommendations?
To stay silent
about what I saw here.
Not to mix with the detainees,
to keep my distance.
One day,
they'll be called to account.
Who?
The men who ordered this.
They'll have to pay.
You must stop your children
from gathering by the rails.
Firemen!
Water!
Water!
What do we do, sir?
There'll be a riot.
I wouldn't blame them.
Roll out the hoses!
That's an order.
What the hell's going on?
Who gave these orders?
I did.
You're here to check the hoses,
not use them!
I don't see a fire.
Roll them back up! Now!
I'm the ranking officer
in this arena.
Step back, Lieutenant.
Attention!
In the absence of a superior,
I'm in command.
And so, I confirm my orders.
Roll them out!
Fall out.
What you're doing is a disgrace.
Hooray for the firemen!
Please!
Over here!
Thank you.
Don't push!
Please, over here!
Thank you.
God bless you.
So my uncle can bring us food.
I've no stamps,
but I put 5 francs inside.
Please...
Hurry!
God bless you.
Thank you.
Gentlemen...
I noticed you taking messages
from many detainees.
Tomorrow,
don't report for duty.
You'll each receive a Metro ticket.
You'll go and post the messages.
As far away as possible,
to avoid arousing suspicion.
If by chance you get caught,
say you're acting alone,
to protect your comrades.
Anyway, do your best.
I'm proud of you.
By the way, Cardinal Suhard...
You read his letter of protest?
"We can't hush
the cries of our conscience...
"In the name of humanity
and Christian principles... "
What do we do?
Nothing.
He didn't even make it public.
So it doesn't exist.
The Germans are here!
You bastards!
Scum!
Deaths every day,
sanitation deteriorating...
I have 100 volunteer doctors
waiting for a simple order.
Jews, I imagine.
All you have to do
is allow them in.
There's no point.
They're leaving tomorrow.
All of them. Even you.
Murderers!
It can process 8000 units per day.
As long as we finish
crematoria 2 and 3 by mid-August.
Ashes, Himmler.
We need ashes.
Ashes don't say
how many of them there were.
They don't say
if they were men, women or children.
Goodness, Wagner is so depressing!
Can't we change the music?
Who wants a cocktail?
Moi, moi, moi!
Eva, you know what I think
of women drinking alcohol.
I don't drink, mein Führer.
I just think up cocktails
and test them on Dr. Morell.
Come and try my latest creation.
For heavens' sake,
don't get so close to the fire,
or you'll explode
like a Molotov cocktail.
Dinner's in 10 minutes.
It's Sauerbraten.
If you'd seen the slaughterhouses
in the Ukraine,
and the butchers
wading through blood,
you'd soon lose your appetite
for Sauerbraten.
It's nothing,
just a touch of heatstroke.
Give him plenty of fluids.
Are you okay?
Fetch her cape.
You're exhausted.
You need to rest.
Are you holding up?
Yes, for now.
You know your destination?
The Loiret region detention camps.
Beaune or Pithiviers.
I'd like...
I'd like to go with the children.
I'll support your request.
Thank you.
Get some fresh air,
you're very pale.
Want a cigarette?
Thanks, I don't smoke.
I couldn't face that again.
Go ahead!
Resign!
Go on. Rebel!
Not one of you has.
Not a single one.
Is it normal,
what's going on in there?
They had it
coming to them perhaps?
It's easy for you to say.
I'm a soldier.
I could get shot.
- I have kids, you know.
- So do they!
They've got no supplies.
There's a grocery opposite.
Why not let them buy food?
I have orders.
Orders to starve children?
They're leaving already?
We're evacuating the whole stadium.
About time, too.
It's not even a real train.
Keep moving!
Keep moving!
That way!
People: 40
Horses: 8
See, Jo, we haven't left France
and we're all together.
Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp,
Look, Simon, a snail!
Come back here.
It's so hot!
And it stinks in here.
Probably, the people before us.
Where are they now then?
Stop it!
You can't get away from me,
you grub.
Stop...
That tickles.
Mrs. Traube!
Where's Hannah?
And your husband?
I don't know where they are.
I saw your daughter.
- Where did you see her?
- At the stadium.
My God! In that case...
Where is she now?
There are other camps nearby.
You need to ask.
You'll find her.
I'm glad to see you again.
Same here.
He's the last one.
My feet are killing me.
All done!
I don't get it.
I heard they're going East.
With no warm clothes.
It's Autumn soon. They'll freeze.
What do you think?
I think the Germans are organized.
Too efficient sometimes.
Do you trust them?
Here...
Sulking?
You don't care about me anymore.
You know I'll never abandon you.
You're my little Nono.
When will Mummy come back?
She's tired
from delivering your brother.
My brother?
What's his name?
He's called...
Julien.
Do you like that name?
And you? Do you like it?
Where've you been?
- Go and play. What's the game?
- The roundup.
I'm sick of always being the Jew.
- You can be the gendarme.
- Come on.
Soup!
The Loiret camps now house
almost all the undesirables.
They're teeming with Jews,
who infested France like parasites.
Turn that off.
It really gets me down.
There's nothing in the soup.
They won't last long on this.
Did you see the daily bread ration?
Go and tell the authorities.
I wrote to the Prefect.
I've gone on the same rations.
What? Don't go playing the martyr.
It's the only way
to prove it's insufficient.
You think they don't know
in the Prefect's office?
I'm not hungry.
Go on, take it.
You think we'll be grown-up
one day?
I don't know.
They don't just want us dead,
they want us to suffer first.
Don't do that. It's all there is.
It can't go on like this
for centuries.
Proletarian revolution.
That's the answer.
Another bloodbath?
What the Jews need is a land.
A country we can call our own.
Zionist?
- Communist?
- Trotskyite. Him, not me.
My wife's religious.
I bet they put bromide in it.
What?
So you can't get it up.
What do they care if I get it up?
Young man!
To stop us reproducing.
Get up.
Get up, your brat!
I didn't do anything, sir.
You just spat.
Not at you. A weevil.
- He's telling the truth, sergeant.
- Keep out of this!
I didn't do anything, sir, honest.
Sergeant to you, you runt!
Don't! He's armed.
Think of your family.
He's on the next convoy in any case.
As for you, doc,
stay in the infirmary
or I'll relieve you of your duties.
Can't you sleep?
Perhaps your sister was right.
I should've protected you.
Don't say that, Dad.
Dear Sir,
I received no reply to my letter.
In it, I described
the sanitary situation here.
The detainees live in conditions
of malnutrition and neglect
unworthy of our institutions.
I invite you
to come and see for yourself.
After 3 weeks on the detainees' diet,
I've lost over 14 pounds.
Nearly all the children are ill.
Come to our aid.
These civilians
are guilty of no crime.
Sorry if I'm interrupting.
No, come in.
You still hope to get a reply?
I'll go there if I have to.
You can't keep starving yourself.
We need you here.
It's the only way I've found.
If you're sick, who'll care for them?
And the next ones?
They won't stop now.
There'll be more roundups,
more detainees.
I'm relying on you
for when I'm gone.
Tell the Prefect Miss Monod's here.
He knows why.
I told you, it's impossible.
Sir!
I wrote and you never replied.
Do you believe me now?
Can you reach it?
Almost.
Got it.
How are my mother and Renée?
- Fine. You want me to fetch them?
- No, no time.
Tell them I'm in Limoges with Dad.
Louise and little Léon
are in hiding, too. Don't worry.
Thanks.
Give my mother and Renée my love.
- Okay.
- See you.
How was she?
Fine. She was all pink
and everything.
She sends her love.
Toffees from Brittany!
Do you want one?
No, thanks, we're fine.
Here...
You too.
Can I have another one?
Wonderful!
- Can we eat it?
- Of course!
Darling, do you want
a bit of your godfather to eat?
At last, I can feast on mein Führer.
Who's coming for a swim?
I just spoke to Berlin.
The French want to deport
the children with their parents.
Why's that a problem?
It's impossible.
We're behind schedule
on crematoria 2 and 3.
We can't keep up.
Find an excuse for the French.
Tell them whatever you want.
There aren't sufficient trains.
The Germans can't deport
the children before mid-August.
That's very regrettable.
How can we overcome this setback?
I say they're sponge cakes.
No, they're biscuits.
They're rich tea biscuits.
I heard there's a factory that way.
When I grow up,
I'll work in that factory.
Cut it out, lads, they're waffles.
Children! Come here!
We have sponge cakes!
Hurry!
Take it easy, eat them slowly.
Come on...
Everyone will get one.
Take it easy and enjoy them.
There's one each.
Imperceptibly
You took over my life
Imperceptibly
You won over my heart
First, you were like a friend
Then a sister
We made witty jokes
About happiness
What do we do, sir?
Switch off the radio?
No, leave it.
I like this song.
Everybody up! You're leaving!
Come on, wake up!
Everybody up!
Quickly!
Everybody up!
We're leaving?
The boy has to go with his mother.
That's an order.
Everybody in the yard in 15 minutes!
Is it true they take medallions
in the search barracks?
Mine isn't even made of gold.
We'll have to tell them.
You'll tell them, won't you?
I'll tell them.
You're not coming with us?
Not just yet.
I have too many sick children here.
Afterwards,
you'll come and live with us.
At Pitchipoi.
I heard that's where we're going.
Of course I'll come.
Just a second.
Well?
It's not appendicitis,
it's a minor hernia.
He'll be fit to travel?
Yes.
Go and get ready.
David...
I've been thinking.
I could ask to be replaced...
I could go with the convoy.
Only Jews are sent East.
They'll never accept.
Listen.
You've come as far as you can.
It's time to say goodbye.
I should have helped you escape.
And let the children travel alone?
I'd never have agreed.
I'll send news when I can.
Not your wedding ring!
If they want it,
they can come and get it here.
In the shit.
You think I'm stupid?
Thought you could trick me?
Bitch!
Is that what you thought?
You dirty Yid!
Get rid of it.
Next!
Right, state your full name.
Put all you have on the table.
Jewels, cash, deeds...
And no cheating.
You saw what happens to cheats.
Come on!
- We haven't got all day!
- What are you doing?
You're mad!
- Lie on the table.
- Your head at this end.
Is that everything?
Go on.
Next!
I don't understand.
Why are the men over there?
I don't know either.
We're ready.
Due to a lack of rolling stock,
your younger children
won't be leaving today.
- You can't separate them.
- You have no right!
Keep them in check.
Stand back!
Back to the barracks!
Don't shoot!
Go back to the barracks.
I wanted to catch the train!
- What are you doing?
- Calm down.
The lunatics'll see their kids soon.
You're the lunatics! You can't leave
children without their mothers.
Shut up!
Sergeant!
Let me do my job.
That is your job!
Escort Miss Monod back.
Don't separate them!
Let me go!
Take your belongings
and leave quietly.
You will never succeed.
You'll never destroy us.
Back in line!
Out of the way! Move!
Attention!
One step back!
About turn!
Quick march!
Pick up your stuff!
Forward march!
You have to live, Jo.
Don't stay here. Find a way out.
Promise me!
I'm getting out.
- Come with me.
- What about your parents?
I've given up hope.
I can't leave without him.
We'll take turns to carry him.
I can't, I have a hernia.
That's okay. Bring it with you.
Stop, it hurts when I laugh.
A hernia's a kind of tear
in your stomach muscles.
I couldn't even lift him.
You go ahead.
I'll see you after the war.
No way.
I won't leave you and Nono here.
- We'll wait till you're cured.
- Don't be stupid.
They said we leave in 10 days.
I'll never be better in time.
It's your only chance. Take it.
- Go and hide it.
- Where?
In one of your shoes.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
You have a raging fever.
You should go and see someone.
Who? The doctor?
The one in Beaune.
We don't want you catching typhoid.
Okay?
Do you know the bath song?
The bath song?
No, I don't. How does it go?
By the clear fountain
As I was walking by
The water looked so lovely
That I stopped to dive in
I've loved you so long
I'll never forget you
Bath's over.
Go and get dressed.
Go ahead, children.
Most of them
have forgotten their surnames.
How will they ever find
their parents?
- You've no idea where they are.
- Poland.
Don't worry.
Why haven't we heard from them?
It's been 5 days now.
The journey takes 3 days.
I doubt they have telephones there.
No news for their children here.
Doesn't that seem strange?
Come on.
Time for your bath.
When you were asked
to take in Jews,
you did,
but in a trickle.
A thousand here, a thousand there.
Always the same with the Americans.
Arbiters of the free world!
What's so strange about the Germans
taking Israelite manpower?
Especially with the Russian front.
But morally...
It's disease prevention, not morals.
We put an end to damaging
Gaullist and communist propaganda.
What damage can some women,
old folks and children cause?
And the invalids? The disabled?
Why this sudden urge
to take on more mouths to feed?
It's absurd. Unless...
- Unless what?
- It's racial purification.
And France
is an accomplice to the crime.
Joseph Kogan?
Weismann?
Watch out!
All clear.
What did I tell you?
Come on!
Let's go!
- What are you doing?
- We're hungry.
- Stop it!
- It's not an excuse!
Tastes like shit, this soup!
Corporal! Quickly!
What's going on?
Come back here!
I'll go first.
You okay?
The problem
of the Israelite children is settled.
For humanitarian reasons,
I asked for families to be reunited
within two weeks.
- Are you cold?
- No.
Are you scared then?
Yeah, I am.
It's not the dead
you need to watch out for.
It's the living.
Goodnight.
Miss!
Get up!
Get the children ready,
they're leaving.
What?
We're going to see Mummy!
Get dressed!
Don't forget them!
Get up, kids!
We're going to see Mummy!
Hold on, Nono, let's get our stuff.
Not him, he's very ill.
Put him down immediately.
- Put him back in his bed!
- They all have to go.
They have fever.
All the children must leave.
I have my orders.
Help me.
You can't even stand up.
Flowers for your Mummy?
They'll wilt in the train.
Pick others when you arrive.
- Who are you?
- The doctor from Beaune.
- I have to go.
- No, wait!
You're running a raging fever.
Where's Annette gone?
I don't know.
But at least we're together.
The children!
They can't travel alone!
You clearly don't understand.
You can't do anything.
You don't understand. Let go!
Please, don't scream.
I must tell you something.
Let me go.
There's nothing you can do for them.
It's too late.
What?
- They're going to die.
- What are you saying?
They'll be murdered.
On arrival, probably.
Gassed. All of them.
You're mad.
Listen!
I'm with De Gaulle.
There's no Jewish territory
out East.
There are camps.
Extermination camps. You see?
Gas chambers.
Some Polish partisans escaped.
That's how we found out.
Most of the parents
are already dead.
They don't keep children alive.
It can't be true.
The BBC announced it
a few days ago.
The Allies wouldn't allow it.
The camps aren't a "priority".
First, they want to stop the war.
Maybe later, when we're organized,
we can sabotage the convoys.
I don't believe it.
- Your full name?
- Bauer Abel.
- Your full name?
- Salomon Thurman.
- Your full name?
- Ylan Kotosh.
Full name?
Simon Zygler
and Noé Zygler.
Your full name?
Bernstein, Suzanne.
Full name?
Gilberte.
Gilberte what?
What's your Daddy called?
Daddy.
Label!
Let me out!
Stop, Nono!
I want Annette!
- Let me out!
- Stop it! Let go!
- I want to get out!
- Calm down now!
What are you doing?
Someone'll see you!
PARIS, JUNE 1945
Go inside and get some rest.
She's my wife!
Someone to see you.
Have you found your parents?
No. Nor my sisters.
I have a hundred kids upstairs,
but you know...
no child from the Velodrome
who took that train
ever came back.
Have you found anyone?
No.
Yes, I have.
You!
I met some good people.
From the North.
They want to adopt me.
That's good.
I'll be going.
I left my name at the desk.
Will you write to me?
Write to me here.
I'll be here a while.
Go on...
Gisèle!
You're alive!
What are you doing?
Get out of here!
You know him?
We found him
near our local station.
He must have been pushed
onto the tracks. That's all we know.
He's not very talkative.
So you know his name?
Yes, I know him.
Out of 13,000 deportees,
only 25 survived.
None of the 4051 children
put on the train ever came back.
Vichy and the Germans
aimed to round up 24000 people.
But on the morning of the round-up,
brave Parisians helped hide 10,000
Jewish men, women and children.
