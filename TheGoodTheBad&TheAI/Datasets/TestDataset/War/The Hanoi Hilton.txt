for yourself,
You know,
individual freedom.
Freedom, the right to think
for yourself,
Is that why
you're here?
I think I've told you
why I'm here.
But if you want
the official reason,
I think I've told you
why I'm here.
you'll have to ask
the civilian authorities.
I think I've told you
why I'm here.
They lawfully
ordered me here.
I think I've told you
why I'm here.
On that level,
I'm serving my country.

why I'm here.
I'm here to serve
my government.

in a decent,
Now, this kid has got hair
almost across his ears,
courteous way,
she says,
Now, this kid has got hair
almost across his ears,
"Don't you find your hair
a little feminine?"
Now, this kid has got hair
almost across his ears,
That little son of a bitch
Now, this kid has got hair
almost across his ears,
looks at her straight
in the eye and says,
Now, this kid has got hair
almost across his ears,
"Compared to you, maybe."
Now, this kid has got hair
almost across his ears,
So I killed him.

to make you act contrite.
CATHCART:
Before we get down to business,
Repeat,
do not act contrite.
CATHCART:
Before we get down to business,

Before we get down to business,
Understand?
Yes, sir.
CATHCART:
Before we get down to business,
All right.
Now explain.
CATHCART:
Before we get down to business,
If Rod Steiger

CATHCART:
Before we get down to business,
why would he want
to help Omar Sharif?
CATHCART:
Before we get down to business,
Because he really wants
Julie Christie.
CATHCART:
Before we get down to business,
WILLIAMSON:
She was in love with

before the POWs came home.
Three years.

ASHBY:
Colonel, could it really
be that long?
CATHCART:
Ashby, we don't have to tell
you that this is not Korea.
ASHBY:
Colonel, could it really
be that long?
We're not gonna be here
forever.
ASHBY:
Colonel, could it really
be that long?
Bombing pause or not, our
people, they know we're here.
ASHBY:
Colonel, could it really
be that long?
They'll never let us down.
ASHBY:
Colonel, could it really
be that long?
I know, sir. It's, uh, just
a little lonely, is all, sir.
ASHBY:
Colonel, could it really
be that long?
I'm not used to being
alone like this.
ASHBY:
Colonel, could it really
be that long?
Big family,

ASHBY:
Colonel, could it really
be that long?
the Air Force, I--
ASHBY:

be that long?
I hate being alone.
You can always pray, son.

My old man, you know,
he was always preaching
that hang tough sermon.
My old man, you know,
His heroes
were the Grenadier Guards.
Whole regiment.
His heroes
were the Grenadier Guards.
He said when the Germans
had the British pinned down
His heroes
were the Grenadier Guards.
on the beaches of Dunkirk,
it was a madhouse.
His heroes
were the Grenadier Guards.
So when
the Grenadier Guards arrived,
His heroes
were the Grenadier Guards.
they lined up in parade order,
band and everything.
His heroes
were the Grenadier Guards.
His heroes
were the Grenadier Guards.
German planes were
strafing the beach.
His heroes
were the Grenadier Guards.
The truth of color.
His heroes
were the Grenadier Guards.
Diving planes killing men.
His heroes
were the Grenadier Guards.
His heroes
were the Grenadier Guards.
Men dying at attention.
His heroes
were the Grenadier Guards.
The only order they heard
was close ranks.
The only order they heard
was close ranks.
Close ranks.
The only order they heard
was close ranks.
They swallowed their fear
and like the whole British army
lived to fight another day.

When I was young...
When I was young...
...at religious school,
I remember a great deal was
made of Abraham and Isaac.
...at religious school,
How God ordered Abraham
to sacrifice Isaac,
...at religious school,
his only son,
his beloved child.
...at religious school,
Abraham stood
with a knife in his hand
and wrestled within himself
to decide whether to believe,
Abraham stood
with a knife in his hand
to trust God.
Abraham stood
with a knife in his hand

And I suppose that most
of us identified with Abraham.

free choice if that was us.

And I've learned that
the greater the darkness,
I know that all people

And I've learned that

Excuse me,

Yeah.
I'm Charlie Cummings.
I went to Greenwich High School.
You're a hero there.
An alum, heh.
Hey, come over here.
Pretty crummy high school
if Ashby's a hero.
Of course some students
call you fascist.
Is that true?
The hippies.
Not just the hippies.
Most people, I guess.
Most people?
Yep. By now.
People are tired of a war
you're not trying to win.
Especially when things
at home are so good, you know?
No, I don't know.
Explain.
Are they going to put us on
trial like the VC say?
CUMMINS:
Nah, I doubt it.
People are kind of into
themselves now, you know,
self-awareness,
sensitivity training,
consciousness-raising,
you know?
What the fuck
are you talking about?
Well, heh,
you'll have to see it.
Maybe to live through it
to understand it.
Right.
Cummings, come on.
We need a fourth
for hearts.
It was a real honor
to meet you, sir.
A real honor.
Thank you.

They don't come near this place.
You never heard of
