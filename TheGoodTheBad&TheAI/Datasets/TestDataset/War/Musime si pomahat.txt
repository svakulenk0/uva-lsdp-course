Well, friends, my wife's waiting.
My dad believes it won't
last longer than a few months.
We won't intrude for
very long, Herr 'iek.
It's terrible, David.
We must be hopeful.
Herr 'iek.
There's jewelry in my dad's study.
You know where.
Just in case.
- Do you need some help?
- Hi.
This is Mr. Imaek.
The younger Mr. Wiener.
- Imaek.
- He's my neighbor Franta.
He's a good man.
Something small for the journey.
Well, good-bye.
- We're very sorry.
- It's not your fault.
Aunt Frieda wrote that
it's okay in Theresienstadt.
Children go to school.
There's an orchestra,
food, even hot water.
Maybe better than squeezing
in the kids' room here, eh?
We just don't know why
she mentioned Uncle Otto's cough.
We're all getting sick now.
It's just that Uncle Otto's
been dead for 15 years.
Good luck.
Al'ik!
Come here.
Herr imaek.
Oh, my God.
Mr. Wiener,
what are you doing here?
I need help.
If somebody sees you,
they'll execute the whole street.
I don't have a choice.
I have to hide.
Good God! Get out of here!
We have children.
Jew!
AJew is here!
AJew is here! Help!
DIVI DED WE FALL
Can't those bastards be quiet?
Bastard means
a child out of wedlock...
and these are
our neighbors' children.
Exactly.
I don't know what drives
people to keep breeding...
and multiplying.
Must be some twisted
self-preservation instinct.
Even if you could have
a child, you know...
I still wouldn't bring it
into this world.
But it's not like that.
Oh, please,
don't believe in miracles.
- Don't pray to her for a kid.
- I don't pray to her.
- Oh, you do.
- I do not.
Then pray.
Don't you think I know you?
You always get
that holy expression.
Your eyes get moist...
and then things
start happening inside.
You're nuts.
Well, and now
your Nazi friend is here.
United we stand...
My friends, good morning.
- God damn your jokes.
- I've got something for you.
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.
I have a surprise for you.
Shall we have some
real coffee, Josef?
You shouldn't have.
You can't tell me what
I should and shouldn't do.
If I can, I give.
I was never stingy.
By the way, Josef, I arranged
papers allowing you to drive.
Thank him.
- Thank you, Mr. Prohaska.
- Horst.
You're in a good mood today,
aren't you?
Why not?
Don't trust London, Josef.
Hey, I see through you, Boss.
Relax. I'm not petty,
and I was in the Patriots' Club.
Come, madam. Have a look.
- Josef, you're not interested?
- But, of course.
Don't say a thing.
Your head is full
of Stalingrad...
and the never-ending siege
of Leningrad, right?
I will straighten out
your errors and illusions.
Imagine this is Moscow.
These are our armies
on the eastern front.
The retreat back to Rzhev
and Vyazma was a brilliant move...
by our offensive
headquarters, understand?
They created an amazing
maneuvering space, right?
And as spring follows winter,
the Fuhrer renews his forces.
And he will pound this space
with all his crushing might.
And by the by,
it's about 250 divisions.
And not only German.
And Bolshevism will suffer
at the hands of Hungarians...
Italians, Spanish...
volunteers from
France and Belgium...
and even the Slovaks.
Cigarette?
I wouldn't deprive you
of 15 crowns.
Well, actually 20.
Incidentally...
a new family is moving
into Wiener's villa tomorrow.
The house has been cleaned
and sterilized.
It could be worse.
So tomorrow they're moving
into Wiener's villa.
I hope you're not going
to keep on pitying them?
He wasn't just our employer.
He was also...
our acquaintance, wasn't he?
Careful.
He was your superior,
and you were my superior. That's all.
Today my superior is Herr Kepke.
Okay, but he was
a decent man, wasn't he?
He did things for you, too,
didn't he?
Look, you can't expect me
to show sympathy to some Yid...
or any other enemy of the Reich.
Come and have a look, madam,
at this husband of yours.
He used to be the energetic boss
of the sales department.
And now he's sitting here
like this, sipping coffee.
Maybe you'd better start
working before they notice.
Maybe you all might have
found out that while...
building the border
fortifications...
a transom fell and broke my leg
in three places.
So for your information
that means I'm disabled.
I know, a loser... A hero.
I almost forgot.
Look at this. Perfect work.
Our Leni embroidered this.
Isn't she clever?
She said it was for the uncle
who always sleeps.
I have one just like it, but...
I never have time to use it,
so much work...
- What are you pretending to be?
- Why, you, you sleepyhead.
And you laugh.
Come lie down.
Lie here and rot.
You're also a hero.
Goddamn it. This...
You have it in your pocket.
Let me see.
Come on. I'm not a child.
What about my head?
Wear this cap.
- I look like a beetle.
- But it suits you.
It doesn't really matter,
does it?
- Is that good-bye?
- No.
It's risky, isn't it?
And all of a sudden,
we understand each other.
Just a hint is enough for me.
So don't go. Who's making you?
Haven't we done enough for them?
Who knows if
they'll ever come back.
- Let me.
- Oh, please.
Please, I can tie
my own shoelaces, huh?
I can't leave them
to those Nazis.
Understand?
I made a promise,
and I need to keep it.
It works.
Mr. 'iek...
David!
Can you take the light
out of my eyes?
- What are you doing here?
- I escaped from Poland.
I needed something valuable.
- But you can't stay here.
- I'm off tomorrow night.
But you don't understand.
You can't stay for even a minute.
Germans are coming
tomorrow morning.
- And with you?
- Where with us?
Oh, you mean at our place.
God, what are you doing here?
I was afraid.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Who is it?
Good evening, Mrs. Marie.
David.
Let's go.
What is that?
I shit my pants. Turn it off.
Take my hand.
You want some jam on it?
- Close the door.
- I am.
You know, this is no longer
exactly a safe area.
A safe place.
It's full of collaborators
and finks.
You wouldn't believe...
what abnormal times
can do to normal people.
The swine.
I would.
What about your family?
I don't know.
They're probably dead.
You wrote that conditions
in Theresienstadt were okay.
No one could write the truth
from there.
It's just a transfer station...
to the camps in Poland...
and nobody there is supposed
to survive.
Nobody at all.
I was lucky to work where
they sort confiscated goods.
Clothes and valuables.
And after 18 months I was able...
to bribe one of the SS men.
Two of us escaped.
And what do you plan
to do here?
I lived here all my life...
so I thought maybe
someone here might help me.
But what are you
going to do now?
Tomorrow I'm meeting a friend
at a set place out of town.
I promised to get some money
and then we'll move on.
Well, I'll give you a lift there.
I have papers.
And I have a car
borrowed from...
an ex-coworker.
He worked in your warehouse.
- Before the war.
- Obviously.
Maybe your friend
waited somewhere else.
No.
They probably got him.
I'll go on myself. You go back.
- Thank your wife again.
- Maybe he'll still come.
Something might have kept him.
Maybe.
Halt! Come here.
Oh, my God.
Good morning.
Excuse me, please.
We're having car trouble.
- How can I help you?
- A number 13 wrench.
- A number 13 wrench.
- Yes, I understand.
- Number 14.
- 13.
It's a Czech car.
Oh, right.
Number 14, wrench number 14.
You've saved our lives.
We've been getting soaked here
for an hour already.
- Do you have enough gas?
- Just a moment.
Do you have enough gas?
Shit!
I'm all thumbs.
You are very helpful and kind,
and very funny.
Number 14.
Start it up, please.
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, my God.
David.
Thank you.
- What are you doing?
- What?
I'm darkening the windows,
and you turn on the light.
- But you're already done.
- Damn it. We must be careful.
Good heavens.
- That's mine.
- Let go.
Thanks a lot.
I know how risky it is for you.
This is for you.
- What is it?
- Oh, no.
David, you're not serious.
Keep them.
Come on. Let's go.
Go, go.
You're afraid, aren't you?
Before the war
many people had these made.
They suspected what was to come...
and made these shelters.
Now they're used
as safes or pantries.
I even helped to make
the one at your father's.
Below here are the stairs.
You can hear what's happening
in the house.
And here bars were torn out.
Now it leads to the rain gutter.
Here's a mattress. Heat will
come in from the next room.
The pig must go.
I'll take care of it.
At night you can come out
if you want, okay?
Well, we'll have to see.
But he has to wash himself,
doesn't he?
Yeah, but mainly
he has to be quiet.
If something happens,
scratch softly...
like a mouse, okay?
Here are some blankets
and a kerosene lamp.
Good night.
Good night.
I'll bring you a warmer blanket.
David...
Good night.
We have to do something
immediately.
About what?
About getting rid
of this problem.
We have to eat it.
- We'll simply eat it, right?
- Oh, God.
But what about him?
What? Do you want
to send him away?
Come on. Want. Don't want.
Does it depend on what I want?
Could I have imagined
I'd be left out of all this?
We watched from the window...
and told ourselves
it was just passing by.
Today it's after us.
I expected something like this,
but I'm still shaken up.
Look, nothing changes
if you send him away.
They catch him around
the first corner and then...
they'll find out he was here.
That he was here
and that you didn't report him.
So, what are you saying?
That makes it easier then.
You want to turn him in?
- What?
- You want to report him?
- Oh, please, really, Marie.
- You decided for him...
for you, for me
and for everyone on this street.
- And are you blaming me or what?
- No.
I'm not blaming you.
It's just good
that we have no children.
You're so right.
What an awful smell.
It's soap.
It's really waking me up.
He has to help us with it.
You think he'd allow pork
past his lips?
In the circumstances,
he should eat what he gets.
Oh, it was hard
and risky work...
getting it here.
Hands up!
- That'd surprise you, eh?
- What an idiot.
Josef, you're asking for trouble.
What is all this?
Marie, you can smell these
shenanigans down the street.
You're asking to be searched.
Show me.
It's not tough yet,
just like the times themselves.
But they will be.
My hat, please.
I hope you didn't get
my car all greasy.
Josef, you're really
asking for trouble.
And what are you
going to do with it?
We'll eat some.
You can have some.
Something I'll take.
Something I'll give.
Marie, come have a look.
- Look at this beauty.
- Where did you get it?
We confiscated it yesterday.
They won't need it anymore.
And here it will add
a certain flair.
So, have you decided?
The position with us is still open.
I feel so good here with you.
Josef always had class.
He knew how to live.
And he got me the job
at the warehouse, right?
TheJew Wiener was stingy,
but good during the crisis.
I fed three kids.
Bastards. Now they're used to it
and can imagine nothing else.
Josef, do you still remember
the boy that everyone called...
Wurst instead of Horst?
- You know, Wurst like sausage.
- I know what wurst means.
Wurst, fetch me a beer.
Get out of here, Wurst.
Back to the Reich.
Back where? My home is here.
You mean with us?
Certainly.
Josef accepted me
almost like a son.
He sent all those jokers packing.
- By the way, is there any beer?
- No.
Come on. Accept. Didn't accept.
That was long ago.
I can remember once...
Today we all just
laugh about it.
Today, I've simply accepted you.
We need to help each other.
I was in trouble yesterday.
Tomorrow it might be you.
Especially, if you treat
the law on hoarding like you do.
That'd mean prison, Marie.
But it's delicious.
- Nothing will be forgotten.
- Hey, cut it out. Kindly stop it.
See how he stares at me?
Don't stare.
- Please, Wurs... Horst.
- Thanks. I've had enough.
You think I don't notice
how some people avoid me?
How they cross to
the other side of the street?
That's their business.
What have I done to them?
To anybody?
I'm helping decent people.
Is that a sin?
No, it's not a sin.
Everybody just talks about
helping, gabs and gabs.
This means helping to me.
- So you're actually a hero.
- What do you mean hero?
Who would be foolish enough
today to act like a hero?
What about you?
You sit here either
stuffing yourself with pork...
or wallowing on the couch.
We have to survive.
Every lovely thing
should survive, be saved, eh?
What are you doing here?
You have to come home, Dad.
Herr Kepke is waiting.
Is that how you knock on the door
of nice people? Idiot!
- This is Karl. Say hello.
- Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
I delivered him with
my own hands. Wait outside.
Get rid of everything.
Properly. People are pigs.
You might be turned in,
and what could I do about it?
To be safe, skin a rabbit
to be able to show the bones.
Since we're
in this situation...
we must follow certain rules.
He drops by whenever he wants.
Do you understand?
- Please.
- Well, what?
He comes by to see you.
I'm just...
an excuse.
Well, deprive him of it.
Take that job he's always offering.
Oh, Marie, it's not...
You think l...
I should...
What?
Do you know where
you're pushing me?
- What's that look?
- Do you know what you're asking?
You brought David here,
so do what you have to do.
What are you doing?
Why are you setting it there?
We agreed on some rules, right?
And you're playing
restaurant here.
Take it to him there
immediately.
Rules will be observed.
Take it to him there.
This is not a roadside inn
for fugitives.
But it's dark outside,
and it's locked.
He can't be locked
in that hole day and night.
- Give them to me.
- Listen.
There is nowhere dark enough
to hide us, darling, eh?
So take it and bring it
to him there. Go!
- Josef, please.
- Please.
Don't say please. Go.
- Why are you pushing me?
- Sorry.
Wish him bon appetit.
Goddamn it!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Your husband is right.
- I know.
But it's one thing to be right...
and another to be able
to stand such things.
Do you need anything?
Aren't you cold here?
Did you finish the book?
I can't read much.
Are you thinking about
what happened to your family?
Kaje, my sister...
could have saved herself...
at least for a while.
After arriving at the camp,
she was offered to be a kapo...
provided she'd be hard enough.
She was given a club...
and told to beat
our parents to death.
I could see
my father and mother...
kneeling there,
begging her to do it.
Come.
Nice.
I haven't seen your wife
for a long time. How is she?
Oh, yeah. She's started
studying French.
- With whom?
- What?
- Who's she taking lessons from?
- By herself.
By herself?
Well, when such
a beautiful woman has no kids...
she never knows
what to do with herself.
She's been ill a lot lately.
I never see her.
No, no, Josef.
You can't refuse medicine.
- Well, thanks then.
- Just take it.
I know a good doctor.
You could go to him.
Confidential information:
They're sniffing everywhere.
They no longer trust anyone.
Anything can be an excuse.
That some Czech starts
with French before knowing German.
- Oh, come on...
- Don't underestimate it.
You also need to train
your facial expression.
The Germans read faces.
They are excellent typologists.
Every day you must practice
that irreproachable loyal expression.
It's easy for you.
You were born with it.
No, I wasn't. Try it.
Relax the muscles.
Now!
Now I don't know what
you're thinking about at all.
- Neither do I.
- Don't laugh.
This was my son Andreas'
favorite composition.
The one who fell, a hero...
at the defense of Kharkov.
Go to your room, Willy.
You know, gentlemen...
of course it saddens me greatly.
But pride is stronger.
And I'm aware of
the significance for us...
of the loss of
a single young German life.
Lately I read...
a fascinating article about this.
Somebody exactly calculated
that the life of one German...
a soldier...
is worth 20 Slavs and 100 Jews.
- A hundred?
- Yes.
I brought you something.
Vitamins and a sunlamp.
A big empty house and
you're stuck in this hole, huh?
I feel so sorry about it.
I'm afraid our neighbors
will figure something out.
I don't trust anyone anymore,
and them least of all.
I have no one
to speak to anymore.
It's enough to speak
to you sometimes.
Thanks to that I can stand it.
Me too.
We just have a bigger
and lighter cell.
What is it?
Do you need anything?
Well, I think I caught a cold.
That's too bad.
Here's a pillow.
Well, good night.
So that old Kepke
isn't a bad boss, eh?
'Night.
What about Marie?
She's alone all day.
Perhaps a visit from me
would cheer her up.
Like I said, she doesn't
feel well, Horst. 'Night.
I am in Paris.
I visit the museums...
The Louvre is very nice.
I visit it three times.
You must be crazy.
I thought you were sleeping.
Did you get the medicine?
Of course, but Prohaska
walked me all the way here.
What if he'd come up?
You once called him a snoop,
didn't you?
Horst...
Careful about darkening
the windows, Josef.
'Night.
I just don't want you going
in there when I'm not home.
- He's not well.
- So give him another blanket.
I already did. I gave him
a fur coat and the sunlamp.
- What?
- What?
My sun?
I don't feel well either,
and you give him my sun.
Go to bed.
I'll make you some tea.
If there's any left.
Don't you want to wall him
in there so you can relax?
Josef, he's really sick.
Exactly. You might catch
something from him.
What are you doing?
I'm going to sleep here
in case he needs anything.
No, I'm sleeping on the couch.
Go to bed.
Don't worry. I'll stick
a slipper in the door.
You're such a...
This life is for shit.
Good night.
I stand beneath the carob tree
And it's not easy
I sit beneath the fig tree
And all is green and free
I lie beneath the almond tree
And it's like a dream
My gorilla
Has a villa in the zoo
My gorilla
Lives contentedly and true
He can't speak of politics
But if his wife has got the itch
he can scratch it
- Good afternoon.
- Agata, come on home!
I need to buy a briefcase...
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Gestapo, Marie.
Cut it out, you fool.
- Hi. We have visitors.
- Josef, please...
Josef, come here.
Please.
- I need to buy a briefcase.
- Yes.
- What do you mean yes, you fool?
- Sit down, Herr Kepke.
Marie, you look terrible.
Isn't the medicine working?
You must excuse me.
The old man's middle son got killed.
To Paul!
Don't give him any more.
He's had enough.
He should speak German
if that's his native tongue.
I'm sorry.
Well, then, to the hero Paul.
Don't you say Paul's name.
Josef. Please...
Josef. Please...
Who's calling us from here?
Who is that calling like that?
Why don't you air the room
a bit, Marie?
Let it go. My Paul.
This is your fault too.
Have you tried compresses
on your chest?
Careful you don't
catch something.
People like me rarely
catch anything. I'm Nordic.
Nordic race.
Marie, maybe
the time will come...
when from the union
of people like you and me...
What are you afraid of?
That time and that human...
may be closer than you think.
Well, Marie,
let's not fight about it.
Josef, your wife is burning up.
Come and see.
My gorilla
Has a villa in the zoo
Bye-bye.
You're Czechs.
You should be ashamed.
- Good afternoon, Marie.
- You startled me.
Healthy, agile, beautiful,
just like I like you.
- Where's Josef?
- Who's that?
He's still at Dr. Fischer's.
I think it'll come out that
you're not the problem.
Look.
What's that? For your wife?
If she weighed 50 kilos less.
I know your size exactly.
No, I can't accept it.
Thank you. Take it.
On the contrary,
you'll try it on now.
I have a car and some
Moselle wine and cold chicken.
- Let's take a little trip, huh?
- No, no.
That's an order!
Josef jealous of a gift
from a friend?
Was he jealous of sausages
or medicine? Try it on.
It's for someone
much younger, isn't it?
Well, that's true,
but it will fit you too.
I'll try it on...
but I won't go
anywhere with you.
- It will be our little secret.
- What?
The test might last
for two or three hours...
and we can wait for
the results together.
We can wait here if you like.
No, I don't want to. Excuse me.
- What now?
- I forgot something.
Good?
And after all, Marie...
we're all as young as we feel.
And today I feel 21.
I need to be home early.
Perhaps you forgot
to feed your pets?
As far as I know
you killed all the rabbits.
If I leave out that woodworm
in the wardrobe...
Am I right?
There'd be no danger from me...
even if you had a buffalo
in that closet.
- Horst!
- Did I hear you right?
- Pay attention.
- I am, Marie.
I am.
But you relax a bit.
You're so high-strung.
As tense as a bow.
Ah, my old acquaintance.
Please.
What a lucky coincidence.
Is it anything serious?
No, just a routine checkup.
Dr. Fischer is
a great specialist...
a true professional.
During 100 sterilizations
of Gypsy trash...
I betJosef hasn't taken you
anywhere since the war began.
Just a minute, please.
Try it. Just a minute.
- And two cognacs, please.
- No, I don't want one.
Why? You're always
afraid of something.
And of what? Of yourself?
Of you.
Of me? For God's sake, why?
I don't know.
I suffer just like you.
Really, I'm not the one
for such trips. I'm married.
To a burnt-out wick.
You voluntarily live in a tomb.
All of us do.
You're married, too,
and have children.
Exactly.
I have a wife,
and the children you long for.
Look, I'll tell you
something, Marie.
I have a very ambitious wife.
She's persistent, enduring...
and with her constant persuading
and working on me...
she completely changed me.
My roots are here.
She's from Germany.
I'm from Bohemia.
You don't really think
I believe in all that stuff?
- Then why did you marry her?
- Because I loved her.
And now you don't
love her anymore.
No. Not anymore.
And do you still loveJosef?
Yes.
I didn't want it.
- Do you know what she wants?
- Who?
That fanatic of mine.
For us to move to the Reich,
to, allegedly, a safe place.
So go.
But they bomb them every day.
She's obsessed with the idea
that after the war...
Czechs will skin us alive.
- Anyway...
- Sorry.
Sir.
A drop is enough.
Perhaps she could lend a hand.
Marie, come and see.
- Come and have a look.
- What is it?
Hey, I got it.
- That's poaching.
- That's a crawfish.
A bit of danger should always
accompany such a trip, eh?
How about if I catch a few
and we cook them for dinner?
They're a great delicacy.
- If it's worth it to you.
- It is, Marie.
You're so beautiful.
Just a parasol and it's...
Beautiful Bohemia, Bohemia mine.
My rising soul is ever thine.
Are you switching to
the resistance because of me?
No, Marie,
I'm preparing an offensive.
- That's not necessary.
- But it is.
I don't like it.
But you are
an intelligent woman.
- Leave me alone.
- Marie...
There's an easy solution
to your problem...
without any experiments
or operations.
- Get away from me.
- I know you want it.
Your solution is just
to rape me!
What rape? Nobody's here.
We're here alone, Marie...
Leave me alone.
- Take a deep breath.
- Thanks for the advice.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I might be pregnant,
and I don't want to lose it.
Right. Marie, I'm not 20.
Don't try to make a fool of me.
Such a lie.
I want to go home.
So go. I can't right now.
I have bad news for you.
Unfortunately, the tests
prove that it's you.
You can't have children.
I understand.
Thank you, Doctor.
Don't mention it, Mr. 'iek.
- Let's cross to the other side.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Imaek.
Don't run away. I can explain.
Libushka, you don't know
the truth about me.
I'm a Czech just like you.
Unluckily, I have a problem
I can't explain just now.
Josef, I don't know why, l...
I'm a decent man with nothing
in common with those swine.
Hello, hello. My friend.
- Would you like a lift?
- No, thank you.
Too bad.
Good-bye.
Come, children.
Let's leave this friend.
Libushka...
Jesus! What are you doing here?
Sorry I startled you.
- I've decided to leave.
- What?
We might not survive
the next visit.
Have you gone crazy?
Dear 'ieks, your reward...
is in the drawer on the left.
David, it's not...
Understand? You leave today,
and we're dead tomorrow.
Where would you go?
Don't worry.
They won't get me alive.
Alive or dead, you think
they won't trace this sweater?
David.
This is just great.
The whole city can see me...
walking around with Nazis...
collaborators!
I took a job at their office...
and now you want to leave.
Where were you?
- Are you going someplace?
- Yeah, of course, Marie.
This guy here got bored, you know.
He needs a bit of air.
Don't shout like that!
David, get immediately
back where you belong.
I know but
if you understand, Horst.
Just a minute, please.
I'll be back.
We must wait a bit.
I heard.
Here we go!
Kepke must leave
the Wieners' villa.
Why?
He's no longer the father
of heroes, but of a deserter.
Deserter?
The little one, that squirt,
was shot deserting.
By his own people, the Germans.
His wife had a breakdown.
She's in a mental hospital...
and Kepke had a stroke.
What is that to us?
- What? You don't understand.
- What?
Prohaska wants to move him
into our place.
- Here?
- Yeah.
- Where here?
- Don't shout.
Horst, could we have
a word alone?
No, no. No cajoling, no bribing.
It's been registered.
This is a solution.
A broken man is no danger to you.
- United we stand.
- Horst...
Come.
- Frau 'iek. Herr Kepke.
- I know.
Please accept my condolences.
A... How do you say terrible?
- Terrible what?
- A terrible tragedy.
A terrible tragedy.
Yes, we're very sorry...
about what happened.
We'd like to help you, but...
unfortunately it's not possible.
Why not, may I ask?
We've spoken about it already.
Yes? I don't remember
that at all.
I'm pregnant.
What?
We'll need the children's room.
Translate that.
I am pregnant...
and we need a room
for the child.
Then that's another matter.
In that case no one
can be accommodated here.
Congratulations, Josef.
Thanks.
I hope you know what
you're doing, dear lady.
And I'll need a certificate
from Dr. Fischer.
Let's go, Albrecht.
Can you forgive me, Herr 'iek?
I apologize to you.
Here you go.
Come here, my little...
Are you crazy?
Wait. I can explain.
Good night.
Why are you here?
Where's the key to that door?
- I made it all up.
- Come on.
You can lie so persuasively
with your upbringing?
That time with Prohaska...
was much worse than I told you.
He acted like a pig.
I never thought he'd try
to get revenge like this.
I couldn't have known
that you'd believe it.
You surprise me.
How can I trust you now?
I've never been with anybody...
except you.
I believe you. I have to.
I want to.
It's only that... Wait.
- What?
- Marie.
This is a terrible problem.
What are we going to do now?
About what?
The whole neighborhood knows
we can't have children.
I have a paper from the doctor.
It's nothing for them
to check it.
Prohaska won't stop.
And if it comes out...
then not even your Madonna
can help us.
- What about the doctor?
- What?
The doctor?
Come on. He's their man.
He's a swine.
Oh, God.
- There's only one thing to do.
- What?
You've got to get pregnant
as fast as possible.
Otherwise, we go to the gallows.
Our only hope...
is David.
David?
David.
You can't ask me for that.
I'll never do it.
Never, Josef.
Are you crazy?
David, come here.
- Someone is ringing.
- I'll take care of it.
Get back in there.
I'll take care of it.
Just be calm.
Well, hi.
I came to speak openly with you.
If you think I'll cover for you,
you're kidding yourself.
Everything has its limit.
I'll never betray myself.
- So don't.
- Look at yourself.
Well, we're celebrating,
you know.
Such big news, right?
So it was news to you, too, huh?
I was lucky to be there
at just that moment.
By the way,
when did she see a doctor?
- What?
- When did she see a doctor?
You mean my wife? Well, she...
didn't want to scare me,
you know?
She's terribly...
She wanted to be
absolutely sure.
For years you were childless...
and now when we need help,
a miracle happens.
- Everyone will be suspicious.
- Don't yell at me.
But it's easy to disprove
unfounded suspicion, right?
Yes, of course.
We're already working on it.
I hope so.
The times are cruel,
so don't play games with anyone.
- Want a drag?
- Do you understand?
Jesus Christ!
So come on.
Let's go.
David...
Sit here. I know it's terrible.
I understand you
very, very well.
Shall we remove the pictures?
- Crying won't help.
- But I can't.
This is a matter of life and death,
and you say you can't.
- I don't say I can't.
- David, it's not against you.
David, come here.
Calm down.
Lie here nicely.
You can't leave us now.
It must be.
We have to. We simply have to.
Damn it. It's our lives.
And stop crying.
How is Mrs. 'iek?
I haven't seen her for a long time.
So you finally made it, huh?
One would have thought
it was a hopeless case.
Fanda, stop fighting!
And, hey...
I'd be afraid to show my face.
I'm terribly ashamed.
I wanted to finally
apologize to you.
I behaved unacceptably that time.
Like an animal.
I'd be grateful if
you'd just forget about it.
I took the liberty of
getting a little something.
Have a look.
I don't need these anymore.
These are for a girl.
And these for if it's a boy.
Are you hungry?
No one's cooked for me
for a half year.
- Hi.
- Josef, where were you?
You haven't come around
for a long time.
So you've been designing
V2s in there?
No, no, I usually listen
to the radio there.
- Have a hotcake.
- Thanks.
- Music?
- Music.
The music some will
have to face.
Stalin's organ concerto? Do you
long for the tyranny of muzhiks?
Come on, Horst.
Don't believe that radio of yours.
I'll show you something. Look.
This is the Red Army.
This is our allies.
And this...
This is your wehrmacht.
And now look.
Don't jump the gun.
I envy your tranquility...
but don't fully understand
your tingling happiness.
And I don't know what you mean
by tingling happiness.
You must have an ace
up your sleeve.
Horst, you act like
you don't know me.
Josef, someone might come here
and investigate a bit...
and begin to unravel
the whole story.
Of course I'm joking,
but now is the time of blunders...
nervousness, errors
and quick solutions.
You know what I mean.
You know that saying
about one boat?
- That we're all in the same boat?
- Yes.
- We're afraid, right?
- Who's we? The two of us?
Not me, I'm not afraid.
Let me put it this way.
I just thought there might be
an urgent need to hide...
something or somebody
in a safe place.
And I know such a place.
My place.
Nobody would look for
anything or anybody there.
Yeah, of course, maybe in
a few weeks not even for you.
If so, I have relatives
in the south, so then there.
Okay, but I don't need
to hide anything or anybody...
with your relatives
in the south.
Goddamn it!
- I'm sorry.
- I'm going to lie down.
You're like a child.
Who will the kid take after?
- Think no one will find out?
- You know what?
Have a hotcake, Wurst,
and then beat it.
- We shouldn't talk like this.
- But we will talk like this.
You can't be serious!
We're not in Paris, out of danger.
Every day here it's life and death.
Let's not pretend.
Where are you going?
The door is over there.
- But I'm interested in this one.
- Damn it.
What's going on?
This is it.
My God, what will we do? Josef?
- Stay calm.
- Do something.
- I'm afraid.
- Just wait.
Dear Mary, help me, please.
Please protect my child.
- What is this?
- Al'ik, come here.
Meat.
There's nothing here.
You are at the house
of a citizen of the Reich.
We've fulfilled our duty.
- Horst Prohaska.
- Yes.
Okay. Move on, move on.
They're gone.
You saved our lives, Horst.
Thanks.
Perhaps three of you.
You mean the child.
Divided we fall.
Andulka. For Al'ik.
Me too. Me too.
Bastards.
That was in our street.
- This is it.
- What?
Wait. I'll get Mrs. Imaek.
No, you better get the doctor.
What? Go out? To town?
David, it's bad.
I've got to go to the hospital.
Take care of her, please.
Marie, be careful.
- Come and sit down.
- No, it's better to walk.
Hey!
My wife's having a baby.
Can't you see
what's going on here?
My wife's having a baby.
Doctor!
I'd like to speak
to the commander.
Good afternoon.
I'd like to speak to the commander.
Good afternoon. I need help.
- Hi, Franta.
- Do you know him?
Yeah. He's my neighbor,
Comrade Captain.
He worked for the Germans,
confiscated Jewish property.
Was close to the collaborators.
He was a friend
of the SS commander.
- Take him away.
- But why?
- You ask why?
- But, Franta...
I wouldn't have come here
if that were true.
Can you disprove
the accusations?
- Of course I can.
- How?
The smell of pork
came from your house...
while you sang German songs.
I hid a fugitive, a Jew.
We couldn't be conspicuous.
I didn't want to arouse suspicion.
I had to be careful in front
of our people too.
Captain, the son of a Jewish
industrialist, David Wiener.
He lived for two years
in our pantry.
You must remember David Wiener.
Today every swine suddenly finds
a Jew or a partisan...
one usually gone
or dead long ago.
But mine...
Mine is sitting on my wife's bed,
and she's giving birth.
Do you understand?
And the doctor is here, Captain.
You're his neighbor.
Is his wife pregnant?
It'll be easy
to see for ourselves.
You say that the doctor
is here somewhere?
- Yes, here, Captain.
- Well, okay.
Suicide. He had poison with him.
Just a minute.
So is your doctor here
somewhere?
Him.
That's our doctor.
Come here. Yes, you.
- What is your specialization?
- General practitioner.
Goddamn it. Did anyone ask you?
No, they didn't.
Captain, my wife's giving birth,
and I need a doctor.
Well, you don't
look like a doctor.
You look more like
a collaborating swine.
Please, Captain. Doctor...
Any complications, Mr. 'iek?
Has the baby dropped?
- Has labor started?
- It's premature.
It's Mrs. Marie's first.
At her age it could be serious.
Captain, we have
no time to waste.
We'll see. I,
representing the army in exile...
Sergei, representing
the Soviet army...
and you, as a member
of the resistance, let's go.
We have enough water.
Please bring some sheets.
Still, even at the very end...
No funny stuff.
And where's thatJew of yours?
Josef, who are these people?
- Friends.
- Did you bring the doctor?
I'm here, Marie. I'm the doctor.
- What?
- Don't yell. Calm down.
And now show us
thatJew of yours.
- Pardon?
- ThatJew of yours.
It's coming.
Marie, relax. David?
Calm down. Where's David?
It's important.
It's coming, Josef.
I'm afraid it's already started.
I'm going to need help.
Well, you're the doctor.
We came on different business.
That must wait.
This is a matter of life and death.
Don't ever doubt it.
Stay here and help him.
- But, Captain...
- That's an order.
And you come with me.
I'm going to need hot water,
some scissors...
and string for that...
- For sealing the umbilical cord.
- I know, for tying it off.
David! He was...
David! He's gone. He was here.
Please, don't be afraid.
I delivered all of my kids.
Don't be afraid of me, Marie.
I beg you.
- Don't push. Not now...
- Horst.
Captain, I wouldn't tell
such a stupid lie. Believe me.
And now my wife's delivering.
I can't have children.
Leave if you feel sick.
Get out.
Look, Captain, this was his.
Where would I get it?
You're trying to bribe me, you pig.
Get up and move.
Be human.
- Get moving.
- Captain.
These are not my jewels.
He hid them.
- Captain, on my knees I beg...
- On your knees, swine.
You're going to shoot me
here like a dog?
- And who are you?
- This is our David.
- Who are you?
- This is our David.
- David Wiener.
- Do you have any papers?
What about this?
Show him your arm.
What about this?
Sorry, but nowadays
we can't just believe anyone.
Do you know the man
in the next room?
Who doesn't know him?
Is he really a doctor?
Mainly, he's a man who knew
about me the whole time.
He brought me medicine and food.
He never betrayed us.
He's a decent man.
He's one of us.
We have a boy.
The picture of his mother, eh?
Good afternoon, Mr. Wiener.
Little one.
Al'ik!
