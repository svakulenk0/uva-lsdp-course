Fog's coming in. Get it, mister?
Yeah, Skipper.
We've been running through patches of it
for half an hour.
The main bank's over there to port.
-See something, mister?
-No, it's my tooth again.
I got a mouth full of little dwarfs
with red-hot pickaxes.
You had that toothache
on our last voyage.
Why didn't you get it fixed
when we were in port?
When I'm in port, I want to see something
better-looking than a dentist.
-You rate a toothache.
-I'd say.
That's punishment for my sins.
It'd take more than a toothache
to pay for your sins.
The women.
Honolulu, Port Said, Cape Town.
Police in Singapore.
I reckon you've been in trouble
in every deep-water port in the world.
I can't think of any I missed.
-Fog' s gonna shut in thick before dawn.
-Yeah.
Parker.
-Yes, sir?
-Pass the word along to the bos'n,
-I want a double lookout fore and aft.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Expecting trouble, sir?
You are here to learn, Parker.
Here's your first lesson.
It's an old law of the sea.
Don't ask questions
when you're given an order.
Yes, sir.
You know, that kid's gonna be all right.
Remember when you were
his age, Skipper?
Yes, mister. I remember.
When I was as old as Parker, I'd sailed
around the Horn in a square rigger.
I came up the fo'c'sle myself.
But we haven't got time
to train kids that way nowadays.
How else can you learn the sea?
By rigging a kid in a fancy cadet's uniform
and sticking his nose in a book?
Oh, why don't you give him a chance?
He'll catch on.
Catch on.
The difference between you and me,
Skipper, one of the differences is,
you remember the grief.
I remember the fun.
Next time we get in port,
see a dentist. First.
You know something?
The last tub I shipped out on was so old
that I found a pair of Christopher
Columbus' cufflinks in a locker.
-Did you have a gun on her?
-Certainly, it had a gun on her.
But, holy mackerel,
we'd ever had to fire it,
-the whole ship would have fallen apart.
-Okay. Deal me in.
This here belly wash gets worse everyday.
Well, if it's belly wash,
you don't have to drink it.
-All right then, it's hogwash.
-Here you go, Peaches. Lap her up, baby.
So you been robbing
my canned cow again?
What do you think we're gonna use
for milk this trip? Bilge water?
Oh, lay off, Caviar.
Peaches has gotta have her cream.
Now, you keep out of my galley,
or I'll cut your liver out
and feed it to the cat.
Excuse me. I've got an order for the bos'n.
Hey, Boats.
Captain's boy wants to see you.
-Bos'n, the Skipper...
-Hey, look out!
Now what?
Next time you come in here,
put your feet in your pocket.
I'm sorry. Bos'n, the Skipper wants
a double lookout fore and aft.
What's the matter? The old man nervous?
Send somebody else.
Don't break up the game.
Let's see, on the flip.
-Hey, what's the idea?
-Oh, you wouldn't have won, anyway.
-Lay off them cards.
-You take it, too, Larson.
You're squeezing us out
because we're losing.
You're sore 'cause I called you
when you had a pair of deuces.
Now, would I do a thing like that?
Would I?
-Yes.
-You certainly would.
How you getting along
with your books, professor?
-Swell, thanks.
-Hey, you better study good
or the Skipper'll put you in a corner
with a dunce cap.
Leave it open, sweetheart.
When I got it off Hatteras,
six guys was caught in the fo'c'sle
'cause the door buckled
and they couldn't bust her loose.
-Sorry.
-Hey, deal me in.
How did a Kansas hay-shaker like that
ever happen to go to sea?
Why does anybody ever go to sea?
Why does anybody go to...
Now, to be out here
in a rust-pot full of high-test gasoline,
a guy has to be muscle-bound
between the ears.
If a torpedo ever connected with this ship,
we'd go up like a match lighted
to cellophane. You ain't got a chance.
Boom. And you're in the hero department,
just like that.
And the next thing you know, you're
picking the Milky Way out of your ears.
-Okay. Okay. So what?
-What do you mean, okay?
Now, wait a minute.
I think you got the wrong angle.
The way I see it, if your ship's number
is up, you're gonna get it.
Yeah? And suppose my number ain't up?
Then, brother, torpedoes can connect
right where you're sitting,
and still nothing'll happen.
Well, I want no torpedoes where
I'm sitting. I'm a sensitive man, I am.
Oh, what do you know about it, anyway?
You carpenters,
you got sawdust for brains.
Listen.
I was shipping out
when your buttons were safety pins.
I was in a tanker in the last war.
I got torpedoed so much,
I got water on the knee.
What made you ship out again?
Well, for years, I had my own business.
I got my own house, too.
Got a little money put away.
Then what're you doing out here
in this floating junk pile?
Well, I want to keep my business
and my house,
and I figure this is a smart way to do it.
We didn't ask for this war.
I know I didn't. None of us did.
-And now all of us are in it.
-Sure, sure.
With you in the war,
we got nothing to worry about.
-It's an open and shut proposition.
-I got faith in God,
President Roosevelt
and the Brooklyn Dodgers.
In the order of their importance.
Boys, the only reason I'm here
is because this is one place
my wife cannot get at me.
I thought you settled that alimony beef
with your missus.
I did. But I got married again.
And you're running away
from the new one so quick?
Well, they chase me, so I gotta run.
Why, they think
they can cut alimony off me
like you'd carve blubber off a whale!
Hey, Boats, what happened to that dame
in San Diego, name of Rose?
Oh, she's still around.
She got married, I think.
-No, she's still on the loose.
-Hey, I know her.
You guys are talking
about a different dame.
The same one.
Said her folks come West
in a covered wagon.
Yeah, you take one look at her face,
and you'd know
why they had to keep it covered.
She looked like Frank Buck
brung her back alive.
Hell of a lady.
Can't you guys talk
about anything but women?
-What else is there to talk about?
-Well, I ain't no hero.
I just went to sea for a summer vacation.
That was 10 years ago.
How about some of that night lunch?
Why don't you give
that tapeworm of yours a rest?
Why should I? It don't give me none.
With that grub you serve on this ship,
it's no wonder we're hungry all the time.
I notice you shovel in plenty of it.
Yeah, but it don't agree with me. See?
Whitey, give me a ham on rye, will you?
The last ship I was on, we eat like the Ritz.
The last ship?
Every day I hear the same beef.
You're always bragging
about the last ship.
And when you sail again,
this'll be the last ship,
and you'll be yapping about me
being the greatest cook that ever sailed.
And you'll be right, too.
Well, I think you're a pretty good...
My corns.
-Oh, you and your feet.
-Oh, I got very sensitive feet.
I found out in the last war.
My corns always hurt
when there's a sub around.
You know, my feet, they hurt all the time.
-But they don't tell me nothing.
-No kidding. My corns are burning me up.
Why don't you shut up about them corns?
-He gets messages in his toes.
-Why don't you bottle them corns?
Say, can't that machine play nothing else?
Stop beating your gums, brother. I like it.
I had a girl who used to sing that.
She had a baby face and a brain to match.
I taught it to her.
Oh, brother. If that was a dame,
you couldn't shut her up that easy.
-They got us!
-Those dirty...
Go aft! Get everybody on deck.
Pop, we've gotta get up on deck.
-Where are you going, Pop?
-My teeth. I gotta get my teeth.
You won't need teeth to chew saltwater.
Get above.
Sound general alarm. All hands on deck.
Aye, aye, sir.
Check the damage aft.
-Stand by that raft.
-Can't raise the engine room.
Parker, follow me to aft
and report back to me.
Aye, aye, sir.
Break out all hands, Steve!
How is it below?
The engine room's flooded.
We're making water fast!
You stay here
and see that everybody gets out.
Aye, aye, sir.
Hit her square
in the engine room, Captain.
She's flooding fast.
We're going to abandon ship!
Stand by to lower away!
Peaches!
Peaches.
Peaches, baby, where are you?
Where are you,
you darn fool cat? Peaches?
Peaches, baby. Come here, Peaches.
Come on, sweetheart.
Daddy's gonna take care of you.
-Let me have him, kid.
-Thanks, mister.
Hey, Mack. Give me that fall.
Hey, you can't take that with you.
Think you're going to Atlantic City?
-Hey, where are your pants, Johnnie?
-I forgot them.
Number one raft!
-Lend a hand over here.
-...sail!
Some of the engine room gang
are trapped aft, sir.
-Tell Sparks to sign off and get in the boat.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Get in the boat. Get away!
What about those men trapped aft?
I couldn't get to them.
There's nothing we could do.
Don't tell me what I can do, mister.
Steve, there's nothing in the book
that says you gotta burn with your ship.
-Waiting for you, sir.
-Yeah, I'm ready.
Sparks. We're shoving off. Come on. Hurry.
I'm signing off now.
Tex!
You all right?
Look out!
Come on, get out of here!
-Ready, Skipper?
-You first, Mr. Rossi.
-Let go the falls!
-Let go the falls!
Send off!
-Out oars!
-Out oars, men!
Come on, Tex, let's get in that boat!
Tex, we're cut off. Let's go forward.
Come on!
We're cut off. We gotta go back.
Step on that stroke.
Let's get out of this oil.
There's two men.
-Circle about and pick them up.
-Give way, port. Backwater, starboard.
Wait, you gotta take that off.
You can't swim with that in the water.
If you make it, remember me, John.
-They're swimming through the fire.
-Pull on those oars!
-They'll never make it.
-They haven't got a chance.
Tex!
Tex!
There he is! Pick him up.
Pulaski! Come on.
Get in here.
That's it.
Who was it?
Tex.
There's the stinking pigboat!
Yeah, they smell so bad,
they've gotta come up for air!
Lay on those oars!
Give way portside, backwater starboard.
Where is your captain?
Where do you think he is?
He's with his ship.
-Why, they're taking pictures of us!
-We're in the movies, boys.
Why, they're taking pictures
to show Hitler.
It should have sound.
I could tell him something.
Take your pictures, you murdering pirates!
Let's give them this. Thumbs up!
They're bearing down! Give way together.
He's gonna ram us!
-Look out for the diving vanes!
-Jump clear!
Clear of those propellers!
Peaches! Peaches!
I lost Peaches!
Make for the raft!
They're moving off.
Go on. Laugh, you apes!
You've had your blood and fire
to make you laugh.
But I swear to God, our time is coming!
We'll pay you back.
We'll hunt you down
and slice you like a piece of cheese!
Hey, they can't hear you.
No, but God can.
Tanker wreckage sighted
at position 2 cast 7.
What ship is that?
sir.
Look!
Look at that.
Destroyer Division 18.
Survivors on raft.
Thank God.
-Which one of you men is Captain Jarvis?
-Me.
-Your cigarette, sir.
-Glad to know you, Captain.
I'm Jordon, Nationwide Newsreel Service.
We'd like to get some pictures
of you and your men.
Now, Captain, will you tell us
in your own words
exactly what happened
when the torpedo hit the tanker?
She caught fire.
Into the microphone, please, Captain.
Not to me.
-She caught fire.
-And then what happened?
We took to the boats.
And then what?
-We spent 11 days on a raft.
-I see.
But here's our chief officer, Mr. Rossi.
Better hear from him.
Thank you, Captain. Mr. Rossi,
are you going to ship out again, sir?
Yeah. Why not?
If you live on the land and your home
burns down, you get another home.
On the sea, it's the same way.
You see, a ship is our home.
If a ship burns, you get another ship.
-That's the way it is, ain't it, men?
-Right.
Thank you, Mr. Rossi.
Anybody else like to say anything?
Go on, tell them. Don't be afraid.
What you gonna say, Boats?
-Your name, please?
-O'Hara.
Alfred O'Hara.
Well, come on, fellows, hurry up, hurry up.
Well, I've got a message
for Hitler, personally.
My dear Adolph...
-Hi, Cap. Thought you was at sea.
-I was.
-Must have made a quick trip.
-I did.
Oh, Stephen!
Oh, darling.
I just got your telegram an hour ago.
-Up until then I couldn't find out a thing.
-Sarah.
Why didn't you tell me when you
were coming? I'd have met the train.
I didn't know what time I could get away.
All these days without any news of you.
We were picked up by the Navy.
They don't give out
much information these days.
No, they can't, of course.
She was a good ship, Sarah.
-What about the men?
-Some of them were lost.
-You all right?
-Oh, I'm fine. Fine.
-You bought a new suit.
-Doesn't fit very well.
You have a terrible sunburn.
-Oh, it'll wear off.
-Oh, darling, I like it.
Oh, I've got so much to tell you about.
Remember the Hopkins' boy, George?
Well, he joined the Merchant Marine.
I really think he did it because of you.
I'm awful hungry, Sarah.
Oh, this is wonderful!
I could soak in here for a month.
Of course, you know it's really dangerous
to take a bath so soon after dinner.
Too bad. I should have brought
my life belt with me.
This feels so good.
I thought
I'd never get in one of these again.
Sleep well, darling.
Oh, I know,
this is so silly.
I'm only crying because I'm happy.
I just didn't want you to see.
I knew it all the time.
After all these years,
wouldn't you think I'd be used to it?
Sarah, I've been through a lot of storms.
I've always come home to you.
I know.
For a sailor's wife,
this war is just another storm.
Oh, darling.
You rest well, darling. You rest.
-Hello, Joe. Been away?
-Yeah.
-Joe Rossi. When did you get in?
-This morning.
Good to see you.
Have a drink on the house.
No. You'd better have one with me.
Hey, what've you got
that's good for a toothache?
Oh, straight whisky. It'll kill it or cure it.
-It never helped it before.
-Well, you never did it right.
Look. Hold it in your mouth
next to your tooth,
but don't swallow. Look.
-Now I'll buy you one.
-Oh, don't swallow it, eh?
-Yeah, it feels better already.
-Excuse me, will you?
-Certainly.
-Good luck.
-Will you keep this for me, please, Charlie?
-Sure.
-New face.
-Yeah.
Troop trains coming in every hour,
all night long.
Planes, guns, ammunition. Why, you can
see them as plain as anything. Yes, sir.
They must be sending off 50,000 men
every night.
Some nights more than that.
Do you remember that blackout
we had the other night?
Supposed to be
Nazi planes hanging around.
Baloney! You know why they had it?
They was sneaking ships out,
plenty of them.
And I'll tell you something. I happen
to know the names of them ships.
Hey, Jack.
The lady's singing. Do you mind?
I don't mind.
The
-It was loaded with guns...
-Hey, Gus,
-do you want a drink?
-Excuse me.
Maybe the news ain't reached you yet,
there's a war on.
Sure. Ain't that what I been saying?
Those are troop ships
going out to the front.
The front's right off Sandy Hook.
It ain't more than 10 miles from here.
They're losing a lot of ships out there
just because of talk.
Talk? Nothing.
Bombs and torpedoes
is what's been doing them sinking.
All those kids, thousands of them,
nothing but bait for Nazi submarines.
I'm telling you,
there was 10 ships in that convoy!
-You saw that, huh?
-Sure, I saw it.
-With your own eyes?
-Of course, with my own eyes.
Well, what do you know?
Come here. I want to tell you something.
A little closer. I want to whisper this.
Now, Pete, maybe you won't talk so much.
Hey, Charlie, I think our friend has
had a little bit too much to drink.
-Don't you?
-Yeah.
-Did you hurt your hand?
-Never do.
Thanks.
Hey, Charlie, another drink.
You don't waste time between drinks,
do you?
I never waste time.
Go on, sing something else.
Look, if you had to sock that guy,
why didn't you take him outside?
I make my living here.
Listen. I did it as neatly and as quietly
as I could, out of consideration to you.
He should have had his teeth kicked in.
Big hero.
What would you do
if a guy was shooting off his mouth?
Turn him in, so he couldn't go
and talk someplace else.
Well, that ain't direct enough for me.
-Do you want a drink?
-No, thank you.
I don't drink with strangers.
-Well, then sing.
-A command performance?
Yeah. I like your voice.
That's not what you like about me.
Well, that's all I know about you so far.
Here.
I guess you two should know each other.
I guess.
-Joe Rossi, Miss O'Neil.
-How do you do?
You better get that tooth fixed.
Yeah, I think I will.
Hiya, boys.
I always wanted a classy tiepin
ever since I was a kid.
So I tells the guy
the tiepin is on Davey Jones' necktie.
So the buzzard gets sore and says,
"That don't cut no ice with me.
"I still want my 80 bucks."
So I says, "All right. Go sue Hitler."
-Well, what happened?
-So I paid the 80 bucks.
-Hiya, fellas.
-Hi, gang.
-Good hands you got, huh?
-Keep it quiet, will you?
-Hiya, Whitey.
-Hiya, Joe.
-I hear you lost your cat.
-Yeah.
The sea is no place for dumb animals.
When you take a cat or a dog
to sea, you gotta catch them young.
-Then they don't get seasick.
-The only place to get seasick,
-is underneath a tree.
-Okay. Drop it. Let's play poker.
One AB, two ordinary seamen, one wiper.
-Relax. They're calling for a wiper.
-That ain't me.
Four oilers, four firemen, two wipers.
-P.U. What smells bad around here?
-What do you mean, what smells bad?
That perfume is worth five bucks a whiff.
I ought to charge you for it.
You know it must be love when a dame
will sprinkle that all over you.
More than 100 men
must have shipped out today.
A hundred? That's only a spit in the ocean.
It'll take thousands.
-They're building them ships so fast.
-Four oilers.
Three ABs.
That's the fourth time in the last half hour
they've called for ABs.
-What're you waiting for?
-I ain't in no hurry.
Well, I figure on shipping out today
or tomorrow.
-You can't wait, can you?
-We was lucky once, we'll be lucky again.
Sure. Luck is riding on our tail.
What's the matter? Don't you believe in it?
I do. I once knew a fella
got bombed three times
without being scratched.
Then he drowns himself
taking a swim at Coney Island.
That's the way it goes.
In a pig's eye.
I'm gonna get me a shore job.
Why should I commit suicide at my age?
For my dough, the only safe run
is the Staten Island ferry.
You'd look good on a Staten Island ferry.
Yeah, and I'll go on looking good
when you're inside of a shark's belly.
I don't think
you'd like that Staten Island run, kid.
-Why not?
-Well, you gotta pass the Statue of Liberty
going each way, and you might
not want to look her in the face.
I don't mind.
What're you hanging around the
hiring hall for, if you ain't shipping out?
I got my rights. I'm paid up here.
I'm a paid-up member of this union
in good standing.
Listen. The only uniform we got
is a union button.
And no guy's wearing one
who ain't got what it takes.
And he ain't got it.
And I ain't playing poker with no bedbugs.
-What's biting you?
-Come on, close your yap and deal.
Deal me in.
You guys are talking
like I was a kid or something.
Like I didn't know what the score was.
Look, I've been shipping out for six years.
It's one thing for you as single guys,
not a worry in the world.
Easy come, easy go. So I ain't single.
So I'm so dumb I got a wife
and a kid coming next month.
So I'm nervous,
and my nerves is waltzing with my pulse.
-Oh, pipe down.
-What do you mean, pipe down?
Ain't it permitted? No more free speech?
Wait a minute. Come on, sit down.
Take it easy.
Don't it matter if I wanna know whether
my kid's gonna be a boy or a girl or twins?
Or like this fella says,
"Charity begins at home."
Or don't it count no more, the home?
Look, we know what's what.
Guys like us killed on ships,
the fish pecking at our eyes.
Who cares about us, anyway?
Everybody's nuts
about the Army and Navy.
What are we supposed to be,
skeletons in a closet or something?
Oh, yes,
and now they're gonna give us medals.
Medals.
Well, what good's a medal
when you're washed up on a beach
in a mess of seaweed?
Nobody even knows what you died for!
So my kid can sing,
"My Daddy Lies Over The Ocean,"
or under it?
I wanna bounce my kid on my knee.
I wanna be with my wife.
Go on, make a law against it.
Put me in the nut-house
for thinking things like that.
Well, why don't you say something?
You all dumb
because I spill what you're all thinking?
I'm thinking plenty.
And I ought to make you smell knuckles
for the duration.
No, no, no.
You got your brains in your fists.
-But that's what he needs.
-No.
If that's the way you feel,
you got a right to say it.
That's what we're fighting for.
But you're seeing it cockeyed.
You think the rest of us have got
nothing close to us, but our shirts?
I got a family.
You think my wife feels good
with me on the sea
and my boy in England in the Air Force?
-You got a boy in the Air Force?
-Yes.
But why talk about such a common thing?
So you want a safe job, huh?
Go ask the Czechs and the Poles
and the Greeks.
They were figuring on safe jobs.
They're lined up in front of guns,
digging each other's graves.
The trouble with you, Pulaski,
is you think America is just a place
to eat and sleep.
You don't know what side
your future is buttered on. Believe...
Don't waste your breath.
What are you doing
wearing that union badge?
Twelve ABs, six ordinaries,
two electricians.
Hey, O'Hara, come on.
It's one of them new Liberty ships.
I just got the dope.
They're signing on a full crew.
-One bos'n.
-That's for me.
One carpenter.
Four oilers. Four firemen. Two wipers.
Have your cards ready.
Please form in line. You'll be taken care of
by the numbers on your cards.
She's one of them new babies.
A big wagon, and she's fast.
Get in line, please. We'll take the ABs first.
Here we go again, daddy!
Look who's here.
I guess I talk too much.
-Welcome home, sweetheart.
-No hard feelings, huh?
Why should there be any hard feelings?
-Got a cigarette?
-Sure. Here.
Why...
-Well, I got you this time.
-Who's all this?
It's Jenny, the wife.
I saw your fat face in a newsreel,
Mr. Alfred O'Hara.
Here's an invitation for you, from a judge.
Oh, listen now, Jenny.
I've been having a tough time.
I've been fighting sharks on a raft
for 11 days.
Yeah? Did a blonde shark
spill that perfume on you?
No, Jenny. That's the smell of the sea.
Yeah? Well, try smelling this for a change.
Them Liberty boats are sure well-named.
Many of you are being assigned
to active duty for the first time.
Others are being transferred to new ships.
Some of you have faced the fire
of the enemy
and given a good account of yourself.
Annapolis and West Point
have a long and glorious tradition.
This is a new school.
But you have a tradition, too.
The oldest tradition
of any American service.
American merchant ships,
carrying vital supplies
to George Washington's army,
were largely responsible
for our first victory as a free nation.
Remember that.
Gentlemen, the future
of the United States Merchant Marine
is in your hands.
Cadet Anderson.
You're assigned to the
Captain Gustafson. Good luck.
-Smooth sailing.
-Thank you, sir.
Cadet Parker.
Cadet Parker,
you're assigned to the
She's a new ship with a famous old name.
You already know the Captain.
Captain Jarvis. Good luck. Smooth sailing.
Thank you, sir.
Cadet Tierney.
Joe Rossi here?
-What do you want to see him about?
-I'd rather tell him that.
Oh, hiya, Steve. Come on in. Have a drink?
No, thanks.
You look worse than you did on the raft.
Maybe. But I've had a lot more fun.
Honey, I want you to meet
a good friend of mine, Steve Jarvis.
We've met.
Joe, I got a new ship.
You're signed on as first,
providing you can report in half an hour.
-And not in that uniform.
-You're not gonna go, Joe?
Baby, I told you it was gonna be like this.
-It's an old story with Joe and me.
-Is it?
I'm always getting him aboard ship
when he's tangled up
in something like this.
-Something like what?
-Oh, don't mind him, Pearl.
The old man of the sea.
You may know a lot about ships, Steve,
but you don't know anything about people.
I know you. She's different.
Everyone of them's different.
-I've heard it in Cape Town, Rio, Bombay.
-That's right.
-Where's your money?
-I have...
-You got paid off in a lot of cash.
-Now wait a minute.
We're not going out of here without it.
I've had experience. Hand it over.
I'll tell you where his money is if you're so
anxious to know. He gave it to me.
-Oh, he gave it to you?
-Yes, he did.
-And we put it in the bank.
-We put it in the...
How do you mean, we?
Me and the wife, we got spliced yesterday.
Joe, why did you let me make
a fool of myself?
-Excuse me, Mrs. Rossi. I'm very sorry.
-Oh, that's all right.
-Joe, how'd it happen?
-Well, I don't know. You better ask her.
I guess there's no reason
that makes any sense.
I guess we just like each other.
That makes a lot of sense.
Kind of hard to believe, ain't it?
-Me, all hitched up with a missus?
-It's nice to believe it, Joe.
You see, he can't go. He just can't.
Baby, look, I gotta go.
We'll sneak in a honeymoon
when I get back.
Take you up to Niagara Falls if I don't get
tired of looking at water by that time.
Joe, please.
Baby, there's one thing
you gotta understand.
Maybe we guys know more about
what's going on than most people.
We've been hanging around Axis ports
for a long time,
and we've seen what they do.
What we've seen ain't nice.
So we can't sit around holding hands
with all that going on.
Right with you, Skipper.
I know how it is, Mrs. Rossi.
I've been married for 20 years,
and my wife feels just the same as you do.
Does she?
She's had a lot of experience
being a sailor's wife.
I'd like you to know her, Mrs. Rossi.
-I'd like to.
-I'll give you her telephone number.
I wish you'd call her.
Maybe she'll tell you that I'm not always
as dumb as I was when I came in here.
Thanks.
I'll finish packing your things.
I guess I'm not used to being
a sailor's wife.
-You better get used to it.
-I'll try.
You know, it's a funny thing. I've been
saying goodbye to people all my life.
This is the first time
it ever meant anything to me.
-That's why I married you, Joe.
-Huh?
So you would have somebody
to say goodbye to and come back to.
-That's what you wanted, isn't it, Joe?
-Yeah.
Yeah, I guess that's what I wanted.
Oh, say,
do you mind if I take this with me?
-That doesn't look like a sailor's wife.
-Oh, I think it does.
I'll find you something
a little more homey.
Yeah, that'll do.
I'm sorry that fellow's in it.
-But I look nice, don't I?
-Yeah, he seems to think so.
-Who is the mug?
-Oh, it's nobody, Joe.
I don't even remember his name.
When'll you be back?
I don't know.
-Where you going?
-I'm sorry, they don't tell us that.
Just someplace on the ocean?
You can't sail on land.
No place where I could write you?
No, kid. I'm sorry, that's the way it is.
It's all right.
Goodbye, Joe.
Yeah.
Yeah, goodbye, kid.
All ready, Skipper.
Well, goodbye, Mrs. Rossi.
Don't forget to call my wife.
-I won't forget.
-I think you'll like her.
I know she'll like you.
Take care of yourself, kid.
-Goodbye.
-Bye.
All finished loading, Mr. Rossi.
Sorry I gave you such a deck load,
but they need all they can get over there.
You batten it down,
and we'll do our best to deliver it.
-Thank you, sir. Good luck.
-Thank you.
Hey, can you imagine us tanker stiffs
on a ship like this?
Yeah. It's like being shacked up in heaven.
-Feel that.
-You're telling me?
Boy, oh, boy, am I gonna sleep tonight.
Hello, chief.
Chief, I want you to meet the guys.
That's Abrams, Pulaski and Cherub.
Boys, meet the chief.
-You gonna take that cat out to sea?
-Why not?
It's dangerous. She might get hurt.
You don't even let her make up
her own mind.
-Maybe she's got other plans.
-She's too young for that.
I'm gonna take care of her.
I ain't gonna let nothing happen to it.
You forget what happened
to Peaches the First?
But Peaches was a lady,
and she couldn't swim.
Now, this cat's different.
You know the name I got for him?
Thomas.
But that don't give him no duck feet.
But that's what I'm trying to tell you.
I've been educating him.
Each day I dunk him in a tub of water
and shove him around a bit.
And now, no kidding,
he can swim like a fish.
Besides, what's he got to worry about?
He's got nine lives, ain't he?
How do you know he ain't used up
eight already?
Why, hello, there, Admiral.
I didn't know you in those blues.
How are you, sir?
So you're shipping out
with the old man again, eh?
Yes, sir. And I'm glad to be with him, too.
Of course, I don't know
how he'll like it when he sees me.
You don't have to worry about that.
Well, this isn't much like the old tanker,
is it? Even smells different.
Sure does. It gives me a kick
to be on a new ship like this.
Yes, it's quite a tub.
Well, come along with me,
and I'll show you where to stow your gear.
-Then I'll take you up to see the Captain.
-Well, thank you, sir.
Another cadet just came aboard, sir.
That fills our complement.
-What's he like?
-Well, he looks pretty good to me.
Been torpedoed, spent a week on a raft,
and he's raring to go again.
That's fine.
We'll need them like that this trip.
Show him in.
Right this way, son.
Reporting for duty, sir.
Parker.
-Glad to see you again.
-Thank you, sir.
Hope we'll have better luck this time.
Get into your working clothes.
-Plenty for you to do.
-Yes, sir.
Parker again.
Book-learning sailors
instead of experience.
Well, I must admit, he did all right.
You know, times change, Skipper,
and men and ships with it.
Take this ship, for instance.
-She's a fine one, mister.
-Yeah.
Why don't you get one?
You rate a master's license.
You should have been on the bridge
of your own ship a long time ago.
Oh, no. There's too much worrying
and paper work
goes with your job, Skipper.
I'd get all tangled up in that stuff
and choke myself to death.
-Maybe you'll change your mind.
-Maybe.
But they'll have to give me a secretary
to do all that.
Oh, here's our gun crew now.
Look at that.
Ensign Wright and gun crew reporting, sir.
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Wright.
My name's Rossi. First Officer.
I guess you'd like to see the Captain.
I'll take you right up.
Thank you.
-Gee, she's a swell-looking ship.
-Yeah.
I hear they got a new five-inch gun on her.
-I hope we have a chance to use it.
-Maybe we'll get a little excitement.
-Get a load of these guys.
-Holy mackerel. Hey, Sid.
Look out. Make way for a sailor.
-Why, they're just babies.
-Where's your nurses, kids?
Ain't you children got the wrong ship?
This ain't no Coney Island outing,
you know.
Look what they sent us for a gun crew.
The Navy must be running out of men.
These guys are just pleading for trouble.
Yeah. Anytime, anywhere.
We're here to protect you guys.
They're here to protect us.
Now, ain't that sweet?
Hey, Mousie, come here a minute.
-See that star he's got on his chest?
-Yeah.
-You know what that means?
-Yeah. He got high marks in arithmetic.
Hey, Mousie,
what was the last ship you were on?
-The
-He means the
The  Are you kidding?
-Did you knock off any of them Japs, kid?
-Yeah, we got a few.
-Yeah, but what battle was you in?
-I just enlisted.
-"Enlisted."
-What did you do before you joined up?
Oh, I had a couple of rackets.
I was selling neckties at cut-rate.
-Neckties!
-Wrap me up a girdle.
-With a blonde in it!
-All right, break it up, boys. Break it up.
Mr. Wright, with your permission,
I'll have my men
-show your boys to their quarters.
-Thank you, Mr. Rossi.
Pulaski, and you, Whitey,
take these men aft.
Yes, sir.
This way, guys. Follow me.
Come on, sea scouts.
They're taking them kind of young
these days, ain't they?
We're getting them young, Mr. Rossi.
We're not taking them.
-Those boys all volunteered for this duty.
-Don't get me wrong, Ensign.
I'm not objecting to their youth.
I'm all for it.
They've all been trained for this job.
Yeah, well, I hope so, because
just between you and me, Mr. Wright,
I don't think my men
could hit the deck with their hats.
All hands on deck.
Stand by your lines, fore and aft.
Okay, boys, stop shooting the breeze.
We're gonna shove off.
Hey, Boats, where we heading for?
I don't know.
Cape Town, Algiers, Zanzibar.
-Now, Zanzibar. There is a town.
-Any dames there, Boats?
-Right rudder.
-Right rudder, sir.
-Steady on the course, sir.
-Very well.
-She handles like a sloop.
-Yes, sir. She's well-mannered.
Periscope sighted directly astern!
Scale, 1500. Range, 75.
-Mark, mark, mark, mark!
-1500.
Ready One.
-Range, 1800, no change.
-Ready, one.
-Mark, mark!
-Set.
-There ain't any subs.
-It's gunnery practice.
That was pretty sloppy, boys.
It took you over 15 seconds.
Let's try it again. Set. Range, 1800...
If them kids are gonna handle them guns,
I'm gonna pick me out a good seat
in the lifeboat, right now.
Wait a minute.
Weren't you men detailed by the Captain
to report here to learn gunnery?
Well, we're here, ain't we?
Well, it's very important that
you learn something about these guns,
in the event that some of my boys
are knocked out during action. Come on.
I want you to watch the loader.
Parker, right over behind the trainer.
You right over here by the pointer.
You right there.
I want you fellows to watch my men
very closely. All right, men.
Set, ready. Range, 1800. Scale, 69.
Range, 1800. Scale, 69.
Cease firing.
So what's so tough about that?
Mister, it took the Navy six months
to train these men.
-That's a long time.
-I could do it in a week.
-It would take you a year.
-Listen, buster...
Hold it, Pulaski.
Suppose you take the place of the man
you've been watching?
-The rest of you fellows do the same.
-Here. This is gonna be good.
Set, ready! Range, 2800. Scale, 35.
Fire!
What do you mean, fire?
I ain't even got the door open.
-That's a breech.
-All right, breech. It ain't open, is it?
-Goldberg.
-Yes, sir.
I'm detailing you to train these men
one hour a day.
Aye, aye, sir. It'll be a pleasure.
What'd you say your racket was
before you joined up, buddy?
-You...
-Don't point that thing. It's for the gun.
All right, men, let's go!
Mr. Rossi.
These are our orders.
Here's the Canadian port of assembly.
We pick up the convoy here.
-You've blocked the courses?
-Yes, sir.
And we take on more deck cargo
in Canada.
If they put any more load on this ship,
we'll have to put wheels on her bottom
and push her in.
Pilot coming over the rail, sir.
There's a Navy lieutenant with him.
I'm Captain Johnson. Pilot, sir.
I'll take her up to the moorings.
This is Lieutenant Mclntosh
of the Royal Canadian Navy.
My name is Jarvis.
This is my first officer, Mr. Rossi.
Glad to know you.
How long will it take to get to our berths?
We'll get through the nets and minefields
in about 45 minutes.
Lieutenant Mclntosh is here to give you
any information you might want
about the convoy.
The convoy commander presents
his compliments and asks
-that you attend the conference.
-That's fine. She's all yours, Captain.
Thank you.
Holy mackerel! The whole world's here.
Australia, Mexico, Cuba. See?
Hiya, matey.
That's something you never seen
in your 30 years at sea.
We're going to live to sail them right into
Wilhelmshaven and Hamburg and Bremen.
I was told to report
for a convoy conference.
-Inside, sir.
-Thank you.
This is the number of your ship, sir.
Captain Jarvis of the
-This is the number of your ship, sir.
-Thank you.
Captain Jarvis.
Ziemer. Man, but it's good to see you.
Good to see you.
-Rotterdam, 1940.
-Yeah.
I'll never forget that evening I spent
with you and  Ziemer
-and the family.
-I don't forget, either.
I read what the Nazis did to Rotterdam.
You mustn't give up hope.
They're safe somewhere.
No.
From my ship in the harbor I look to
the Zeelandstraat where my house is,
and I see Stukas diving.
I see flames and smoke and ruin.
They are not safe.
Some day it'll all be over.
Then we'll be able to sit once more
in your garden by the canal.
Attention.
Gentlemen, I wish to introduce
the convoy commander,
who will preside at this conference.
Rear Admiral Hartridge,
United States Navy.
Thank you, gentlemen, carry on.
Captain Williams, my operations officer,
will give you the details.
Each of you has been given a slip of paper
which contains the number of his ship.
The ships of this convoy,
designated as Convoy 211,
will put to sea at the respective times
marked in the sealed orders
to be given you
at the close of this meeting.
You will also receive your codes, ciphers
and zig-zag plans
from Lieutenant Commander Brown
at the end of this meeting.
Immediately upon weighing anchor,
each ship will display her number
by a hoist of flags
of the International Signal Code.
You will proceed directly
to the point of rendezvous
and assume your positions,
as shown by this diagram.
Our convoy is made up of 73 vessels,
not including the naval escort.
In order to maintain your position,
you have only to match your number
with those of the ships around you.
Let's take a number at random.
-Number 28.
-Why, that's my number.
The numbers of the ships abeam of you
must be 27 and 29.
And the numbers of the ships
forward and astern of you
must be 18 and 38, respectively.
Now, let's move
to the other end of the line.
Number 21.
-That's me.
-This is your position, Captain.
Your normal stations
will be 500 yards apart.
The command will carry
the signal number 00.
She should be watched for signals
at all times.
Are there any questions, gentlemen?
Yes, Captain?
-Do we use only flags for communication?
-No, Captain.
We will use five means of communication.
Blinker light, rocket, whistle, flag
and when practical, loudspeaker.
But absolute radio silence
must be maintained at all times.
Yes, Captain?
What means of communication do we use
if we lose contact with each other,
-or if we're forced to scatter?
-None.
In the event that we are forced to scatter,
you will proceed to a new rendezvous
at a time and place
indicated in your sealed orders.
Are there any further questions,
gentlemen?
Gentlemen,
I do not need to emphasize the hazards
you're likely to encounter.
You all know the efforts
the enemy is making
to cut the lifeline of Allied supplies.
Most of us are strangers here.
Our vessels fly the flags of many nations.
But we will know each other better
after this trip.
Good luck and Godspeed.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I will see you at our destination.
All the ships are clearing the harbor
very handily, Admiral.
I doubt if there'll be much delay
at the rendezvous.
Good. Signal the escort force
to commence screening operations.
Aye, aye, sir.
Mr. Burk, signal the escort force
to commence screening operations.
Aye, aye, sir.
Signal, pennant four, William. Jig easy.
Pennant four, William. Jig easy.
On the searchlight.
Signal, pennant four, William. Jig easy.
-William.
-Jig easy.
Coastal patrol to convoy commander.
Coastal patrol to convoy commander.
This is where we leave you.
Good luck.
-Our sealed orders opened yet?
-They are.
-Ten minutes ago.
-Where we headed?
-Russia, port of Murmansk.
-Murmansk?
-Well, this trip ain't gonna be no picnic.
-Never has been.
I guess the only thing that's important
is to get that stuff to Russia
as quick as possible.
That's right, mister.
Make yourself and all the officers
acquainted with those orders.
Yes, sir.
What a day. What a day.
So rough out there, even the fish
are trying to get out from under.
Yeah.
You know, this is the kind of a day
I'd like to be home
-with a blonde and a book.
-Since when can you read?
-Who said I could read?
-But you said...
Parker?
-Yes, sir. Skipper want me, sir?
-No.
No, I was just surprised
to see you sitting up.
-You better turn in.
-I was trying to, but I couldn't make it.
Sit down.
Now, these nights are killers, aren't they?
Yeah, I lie in my bunk with my clothes on
and try to sleep,
but every time that engine slows down,
my heart speeds up.
In time, I think I can train myself
to have an iron nerve like you have.
Let me tell you something
about my iron nerve, son.
It's made of rubber,
just like everybody else's,
so it'll stretch when you need it.
You know, people got a funny idea
that being brave is not being scared.
But I don't know. I always figured
that if you weren't scared,
there was nothing to be brave about.
The trick is,
how much scaring you can take.
-I got an idea you can take plenty.
-I hope so.
-Oh, that's your girl?
-Yes, sir.
Well, she's nice-looking.
-What's her name?
-Emily Jordan.
We want to get married,
but we've got to wait
till I get my third mate's papers.
You're young enough to wait.
-How'd she feel about your going to sea?
-Well, she didn't feel good.
Same as my wife.
Here. Take a squint of this.
-Say, she looks swell.
-Yeah.
Yeah, we didn't have time to have
a real good picture taken.
You know, it's kind of nice to have
somebody at home
-thinking about you, ain't it?
-Yeah.
How'd you ever happen
to join the Merchant Marine?
That's what I wanted to do
even when I was a kid.
I guess I've read everything
written about ships.
Dana, Conrad, Marriott, Melville.
I never got around to reading that stuff.
I've been too busy doing it.
It seems to me like the toughest,
most important job anybody can do.
-Both for now and after the war.
-You're right, son.
There's no job bigger than this.
Let me tell you something.
No matter how many planes and tanks
and guns you pile up,
no matter how many men you got,
it doesn't mean a thing, unless the men
get the stuff when they need it.
That's your job and my job
to see that they get it.
Gee, Mr. Rossi,
when you have your own ship,
I hope I have a chance to sail with you.
I'm afraid I'm a little too easygoing
to be a skipper.
Well, you better turn in
before you go on watch.
-Good night.
-Good night, sir.
Fog bank dead ahead!
Fog bank dead ahead!
It's getting thicker every minute.
If it gets much thicker,
we'll have to chop our way through it.
-Parker?
-Yes, sir.
-Take a man aft and rig the towing spar.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Come on, let's get this spar overboard
before that ship back there climbs our tail.
I wish we had one of these
sticking over the side.
-What for?
-To keep that Dutch ship off us.
I don't want no 10,000 tons of TNT
smacking me in the kisser.
You got nothing to worry about.
He's just as scared as we are.
-I don't know. Ready?
-Heave.
Spar dead ahead!
-Slow her down five turns.
-Slow her down five turns.
What's the matter?
Have you got fog up there?
Thicker than your skull.
-Ship close aboard! Port beam !
-Hard right!
Hard right, sir.
Wake up, you dumb son of a sail fish.
You dead or gone blind?
-Hard right!
-Wheel's hard right.
Ship swinging right all the time, sir.
Well, we've just missed
some nice fireworks.
Whew.
Well, Brown, it's a relief to get clear
and have so many
of the convoy astern of us.
Yes, Admiral. Signal force reports
practically all ships in sight.
Good.
Check the number
of those ships, Mr. Rossi.
-Yes, sir.
There's that old Dutch tub
right abeam of us.
They're all over the place.
Looks like they'll have to
shuffle the pack and deal again.
-Signal attack formation.
-Aye, aye, sir.
From convey commander to 371 and 406.
Room 406 to convoy commander.
Go ahead.
Search and attack submarines
on starboard quarter of convoy.
All engines ahead, flank speed.
Back to your stations.
Sound general alarm.
All hands on the board deck.
Set out your fire equipment.
This attack may be a decoy.
Have the rest of the escort
remain on station.
The main attack may come
from another quarter.
Aye, aye, sir.
On the searchlight.
Emergency pennant. Dog. King.
Emergency pennant. Dog. King.
Periscope two points abaft the port beam.
-Signal 308 submarine's position.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Convoy commander to 308.
From 308 to convoy commander.
Go ahead.
Periscope two points abaft
of port beam of flagship.
Distance, 1,400 yards.
-Left full rudder, Quartermaster.
-Aye, aye, sir. Left full rudder.
All engines ahead and flank speed.
Thirty-eight seconds,
let go your first charge.
Aye, aye, sir. Thirty-eight seconds.
-Stand clear of the depth charge racks.
-Stand clear of the racks.
Stand clear of the racks!
-Let go number one.
-Let go number one, sir.
Number one gone!
Number one gone.
-Brown, signal the convoy to disperse.
-Aye, aye, sir. One pennant. Easy cast.
-Signalman, one pennant, easy cast. Hit it.
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Fire dispersal rocket.
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Stand by to fire your rocket.
-Ready with the rocket, sir.
Fire.
-Looks like the Nazis are all around us.
-We've run into a wolf pack.
That depth charge brought him up.
After gun, train on target off port quarter.
If this keeps up,
somebody's gonna get hurt around here.
Forward gun.
Submarine on starboard bow.
Control. New target on starboard beam.
Concentrate all guns.
Come right 20 degrees. We'll ram her.
There's one they won't have to ram.
-Grades 1650. No change.
-Ready.
That one had his name on it,
for the little one
with the moustache, Schickelgruber.
Oh, we did it.
-Scratch one sea skunk.
-Come left and steady up on 290.
Come left and steady up on 290, sir.
Torpedo three points of starboard bow,
-We're going sky-high.
-Rudder amidship.
-Rudder amidship, sir.
-Turn your guns to starboard.
So long, baby.
-That was close, sir.
-Yeah.
Break out one of the cargo booms,
put a sling on this bomber
-and get it in place.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Four men with lines!
Over the side and secure those chains.
If we ever get to Murmansk,
I'm gonna buy me a barrel of vodka
and get stinking.
You better get two, then you'll have one.
You know, it's a funny thing,
now that it's all over,
my corns is burning like a house afire.
You got more sense in your feet
than you got in your head.
-At least your feet know we're in trouble.
-What're you beefing about now?
Well, what chance have we got here
all alone in the North Atlantic?
They can pick us off here
like a duck in a barrel.
Well, the convoy's gonna
get together again.
-Who says so?
-They got it all fixed.
They got one of them things
like you have with dames.
-What things?
-You know, a fellow and a dame.
Yeah, the...
A guy's been going with a dame
for a long time,
then he don't see her for a long time.
Then he... Then they get together again.
Rendezvous.
Abrams, get your tail off that deck.
You're not parked in the bleachers!
Pulaski, get the lead out of your breeches.
This is no Bronx picnic.
Aye, aye, sir.
Who does he think he is, Simon Legree?
Go on with this...
Hey, take a look at that.
-What do you make of it?
-It's a sub.
-Mr. Wright!
-Yes, sir.
Off the port quarter.
That's a U-boat all right.
She's out of range.
She's playing tag and we're it.
-Hard right, Quartermaster!
-Hard right, sir.
Now, gentlemen, as you know,
a submarine's been tailing us for hours.
I deliberately changed my course
to lead them away from the convoy.
You know what that means?
We can't rejoin. We're on our own.
Mr. Wright, it looks as if you and your men
will have that chance
you've been waiting for.
The sub's keeping out of range, sir,
because she doesn't want to match guns.
I think she'll dog us till night, submerge
and then attack.
Maybe.
Mr. McGonigle,
if you've a couple of extra knots
up your sleeve, I want them right now.
I'll try, sir.
We can't expect any help.
Our first job is
to shake that sub off our tail.
Our next is to beat our way to Murmansk
and deliver the goods.
With God's help,
that's what we intend to do.
Mr. Rossi, double your watch
and be ready for any emergency.
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Thank you, gentlemen.
Aye, sir.
I wonder what them guys in the sub
are thinking about.
They're Nazis. They don't think.
What do you mean,
"They're Nazis. They don't think"?
Don't kid yourself. They think all right.
Wanna know what they're thinking about?
About us. About this ship.
They're thinking about knocking us off.
I can't understand it.
There's a sub following us,
and my feet don't hurt.
-Mr. Wright?
-Yes, sir.
What can we expect?
After dark, he'll probably pick up speed
to get ahead of us,
and stay with us to pick up the convoy.
Any case,
he'll let us have one before dawn.
Anything we can do
to put your guns in range?
No. If we slow down, he will, too.
-It'll be dark in another hour.
-Yeah.
It's gonna be a black night and a long one.
-She seems to be coming up a little.
-Yeah.
-Why not throw a shot at her?
-No, she's too far out of range.
-One round will keep them away.
-I'll try one, sir.
After gun,
be ready to fire on target off port quarter.
Fire!
I figure in about two hours
they'll be abeam of us.
Yes, sir.
We've got a lot of waiting to do.
-How's your pulse, kid?
-I'm okay, sir.
There's not much of a chance
of getting away from them, is there?
No way that I know of.
If we run, they'll follow us.
If we stop, they'll spot us
with their listening devices,
if there's anything to listen...
Parker, have the Chief Engineer report
to me in the Chart Room on the double.
Aye, aye, sir.
Hey, Cap, you know
it's only going to be a short time
-before that sub comes up abeam of us.
-I know that, mister.
I've asked the Chief Engineer
to come up here
to find out if it's possible to turn off
every piece of machinery.
-Cut out every sound.
-To beat the sub's sound detector?
Well, we've got to.
They can pick up anything.
-You mean secure the boilers?
-Yeah.
It's the only way
I could think of to lose that pig boat.
-Oh, in here, Mac.
-Did you send for me, sir?
Chief, can you black out
every sound onboard?
Pumps, circulators,
generators, everything.
-The whole plan.
-I can,
but I won't be responsible
for the safety of the ship.
Will you be responsible
for the safety of the ship
if we get struck with a torpedo amidships?
How long will it take you
to secure everything?
-Ten minutes.
-Can you get steam up again
-in half an hour?
-Yes, sir.
-It's worth the risk. Go ahead.
-Aye, sir.
Mr. Rossi, check the wind
and estimate the drift.
Pass the word along to the bos'n.
I want complete silence
throughout the ship.
Aye, sir.
Everything's secure, sir.
All we gotta do now is wait.
-I wish I was in Times Square.
-Why?
I'd take a subway home.
There you are, baby.
Stay put, and for crying out loud,
don't make no noise.
I tell you, there's no sub around.
My corns don't hurt.
Do you know what I'm doing
when this is over?
I'm putting into port,
I'm getting off the ship
and putting an oar on my shoulder,
and I'm starting inland.
And the first time a guy says to me,
"What's that on your shoulder?",
that's where I'm settling
for the rest of my life.
-Shut up!
-Hey, pipe down.
I think we've got something out there.
Do you hear it?
Sounds like she's about
a half mile off our stern.
Yeah.
My heart is pounding so fast
it's gonna bust right out of my chest.
Take it easy, kid.
I'm gonna tie a knot in that cat's neck
and toss it overboard.
Wait a minute, guy.
I can't hear it right now. She's gone.
There's no telling.
They may have blacked out, too.
We'll drift till dawn.
All clear, mister?
All clear here, sir.
-Portside, what do you see?
-All clear, sir.
-Can't pick up a thing.
-Very well.
Mr. Wright, check with the crow's nest.
Crow's nest, everything clear out there?
-All clear, sir.
-Good.
I'll give you all the steam you need
in half an hour, sir,
and maybe before that.
Light off both boilers.
Get the fires
under both boilers right away.
It sure feels swell to be moving again.
It sure was like sailing
a ghost ship last night.
Listen.
-Listen to what?
-Them engines.
Don't they sound good?
Don't do that, Pulaski.
My ears are still sticking out
from all the listening I did last night.
How do you like that?
Don't you know you just scared me
out of two years' growth?
And at my age, that ain't so good.
I felt like cheering when the sun came up,
and that stinking sub wasn't around.
It feels nice and warm in here.
What's the matter, kid? You're not eating?
Oh, I ain't hungry.
No wonder he ain't hungry,
with this belly wash.
-This what?
-Belly wash. That's what I said,
and that's because I'm polite.
If it ain't the mines, it's the subs.
If it ain't the subs, it's the bombs.
If it ain't the bombs,
it's this arsenic this guy gives us for grub.
-You ought to be charged with murder.
-Why don't you dry up?
Don't pay any attention to him, Cookie.
We're all at a point where
we're gonna bite off each other's heads.
I nearly bit my own off last night.
What's the matter... Don't tell me
your feet're hurting you again.
-No, it's my head.
-Well, that's okay with me.
Just so it ain't his feet.
Now, wait a minute. This may be serious.
-Just how bad does your head hurt?
-Oh, very bad. Very bad.
It's a funny thing, I can't understand it.
I hardly ever have a headache.
You shouldn't eat so much
with a headache.
Why not? It don't go to my head.
Anything else hurt?
-Yes, my...
-Never mind.
You hear that?
May be Russian planes
coming out to meet us.
May be,
but that's Norway off to starboard.
Unidentified planes off the starboard bow.
Aircraft sighted.
-Where away?
-Starboard bow.
Altitude approximately 10 to 15.
Unidentified planes,
two points off starboard bow.
Sound general alarm.
Sound general alarm.
Anti-aircraft batteries track target.
Nazi planes.
They're enemy planes, sir.
Get that guy down out of the crow's nest.
Crow's nest. Come on down out of there.
Engine room. Stand by for maneuvers.
Aye, aye, sir.
-Tight right.
-Left.
We'll con the ship from the wheelhouse.
Get the Quartermaster below. Steer 40.
Get below.
Steer 40 and signal when you're ready.
Aye, aye, sir.
-We got one.
-We got him.
-We got it.
-We got it.
Get to shelter, Skipper. They're strafing.
-Where'd it get you, Steve?
-In the leg.
-Take over, Joe.
-All right, boys. Take him to his cabin.
Yes, sir.
Forward gun. Forward gun.
Our system's dead.
Parker, go forward. On the double.
Get back there. I'll load her.
Here he comes again, spitting.
We'll spit right back at him.
He'll never come back.
Look out.
Mr. Rossi. Give me a hand here, will you?
Here, Mr. Rossi.
Right here, Mr. Wright.
-Well done, Parker.
-Thank you, sir.
Need another man here.
Yeah, just take it easy.
How many of these do you want, Steve?
Just one.
Here you are, Skipper.
-What's the condition of the ship?
-She's still afloat.
Can you keep her afloat?
We got to. You're in no condition to swim.
What about the men?
I'll tell you about that later, Steve.
Parker?
Later, Steve.
I'll give you a full report later.
Now, this is gonna sting a little bit.
Oh, close those ports. Let's get that lamp.
A little higher.
Just hold that leg down tight.
Don't let it move.
Well, here we go, Steve.
I'm gonna start digging.
All right. Go for it.
As a surgeon you're a great first mate.
-Did you get it?
-Yeah.
Oh, hand me that bottle of sulfur.
That brown bottle there. That's right.
-I think you'll be all right now, Steve.
-Thank you, Joe.
How do you feel now, Steve?
Better, Joe.
So you got a ship of your own, after all.
-You are the Skipper from now on.
-I'll try to take care of her for you.
I'll look in on you later.
-How's the Captain?
-Well, we'll know better in a few hours.
-Have you got Parker's things packed yet?
-Almost finished, sir.
Stow them in my cabin
when you get through.
We'll send them back to his folks
in Kansas, when we get to the States.
It ain't much for them to get back.
What about these?
I'll take them. They're to his girl.
He told me about her.
-Is that her?
-Yeah.
Oh, here's one that ain't finished yet.
-I didn't mean to, Mr. Rossi, but I read it.
-That's okay.
It's got things in there,
like where he says he was so scared
he couldn't sleep nights.
That's the way we all feel.
But he says it was okay on account
of he has confidence in us, the crew.
-He was a good kid.
-Yeah, and I used to ride him all the time.
He made a fine officer.
Do you mean that he used to study
all these books?
Well, you gotta learn it
one way or another.
Mr. Rossi, do you mind
if I borrow a couple of these?
I don't think Parker will mind.
Report on deck
when you get his gear stowed.
If you work hard enough, maybe you can
wear one of those some day.
All ready for the service, Steve.
I wish I could do it for you, Joe.
I think you better mark in the book
the parts that I'm to read.
I've done that.
"I am the resurrection, and the life,"
says the Lord.
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.
"And whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die."
"We brought nothing into this world,
and it is certain we can carry nothing out."
"The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away;
"blessed be the name of the Lord."
Now that's the word of God.
And it's good.
I don't think He'd mind if I put my oar in.
These are eight men we knew and liked,
guys like us.
Guys we ate with and slept with
and fought with.
Well, we were just a little luckier
than they were.
We'll miss them. All of them.
Gunner's Mate, First-class,
Michael Ahearn.
Gunner's Mate, Second-class,
Frank Rosetti.
Apprentice Seaman, Maurice Goldberg.
Able Seaman, George Anderson.
Able Seaman, William Ordinski.
Able Seaman, John Murphy.
Able Seaman, Henry Boehn.
And Cadet Ezra Parker.
I guess I knew Parker a little better
than the others. He came from Kansas.
He had a girl. All the ocean he ever knew
was in a mud-hole,
but he had to go to sea.
Well, we're giving them all
a good send-off.
It's too bad their folks ain't here to see it,
'cause I know they'd feel better about it.
I'm sorry they had to die.
I'm sorry they didn't get a chance
to live out their lives,
so they could've finished the things
they started out to do.
But those are the breaks.
Any one of us could be
lying here tomorrow,
and somebody reads a book over us,
and we're tossed in the sea.
But that ain't what's important.
A lot more people are gonna die
before this is over,
and it's up to the ones that come through
to make sure
that they didn't die for nothing.
Now, will you men join me
in the Lord's Prayer?
"Our Father, who art in Heaven,
"Hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
"Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
"Give us this day our daily bread.
"And forgive us our trespasses,
"as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
"And lead us not into temptation.
But deliver us from evil. Amen."
"We therefore commit his body
to the deep,
"looking for the general Resurrection
in the last day,
"and the life of the world to come,
through our Lord Jesus Christ,
"at whose second coming
in glorious majesty to judge the world,
"the sea shall give up her dead;
"and the corruptible bodies of those
who sleep in him shall be changed,
"and made like
unto his own glorious body;
"whereby he is able to subdue all things
unto himself."
Yeah, I wish we'd run into
some good, dirty, stinking fog.
That would help keep them away.
-How's your forward gun, Mr. Wright?
-Pretty bad shape. We're patching her up.
The attacks are okay, though.
Keep working on that gun.
We may need it.
How's it below, chief?
Plates are none too good.
Propeller shaft took the line.
How much speed can you make?
Less than half of what
you've been getting.
About six knots.
-How's your cargo?
-Can't take much more of a beating, sir.
Pardon the suggestion, mister,
but why don't we head for Scotland?
We could pick up a convoy there.
And I'm telling you, a trip to perdition
would be like a pleasure cruise
compared to what we are going under.
-No, we'll hold our course. Smoke?
-Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Now don't worry, Mac. We'll make it.
I hope so. I can't swim.
Light, sir?
-Another match, please.
-What's the matter, you superstitious?
No, but I do not like to tempt Providence.
Looks like they got us in number one hold.
There's a hole forward, sir,
you can drive a tank through.
Break out all the gasoline and oil you got,
spread it amidships and set fire to it.
Aye, aye, sir.
Mac, what's the damage down there?
Making water, sir.
We've started the bilge pump.
-We can keep her under control.
-All right. Keep operating.
And send a man forward
to secure the bulkhead.
All hands to the cargo winch.
Turn your guns to starboard
and hold your fire.
Bring out those fire buckets,
throw out the sand,
fill them with gas and oil, spread them
in the forward deck and light it.
What? Has he gone crazy?
What's he want to burn the ship up for?
Trying to bring that sub to the surface.
Mac, come here with me.
If they think we're sinking,
they won't waste a torpedo on us.
They may surface.
Stand by here to break out this fire hose!
Stand by the fire hose.
Engine room. Let oil into the boiler fires.
-We'll give it to you, mister.
Open up three, five and seven oil valves.
Radio room, send out S.O.S.
We're abandoning ship,
and don't believe it.
Look. She's surfacing.
-Hard right!
-Hard right, sir.
Rudder hard right.
Ship swinging right all the time, sir.
-Steady as you go!
-Steady as she goes, sir.
-Where do you think we hit her?
-That's a job for a glass-bottom boat.
Why doesn't anyone report to me?
Steve, you remember
when the old tanker burned,
and the Nazis rammed our lifeboat?
And you swore you'd find them
and slice them like a piece of cheese?
Don't leave the bridge,
and I'll talk to you later.
Aye, aye, sir.
Bos'n! Get that fire out. Get a move on.
You wanna go into Murmansk
looking like a tramp?
-How many more days to Murmansk?
-Oh, a couple, maybe three.
I keep pinching myself to see if I'm alive.
Keep pinching, will you?
We ain't there yet.
Hey, look.
I think they're on our side!
Famous last words.
No, they're ours all right.
Russian planes on the starboard quarter!
You sure you can make it?
I'll be on that bridge if Chips has to build
a frame to hold me up.
-How do you like that? Nice, huh?
-A regular Rembrandt.
You know, if we keep knocking off Nazis
like this,
they'll be commissioning us into the Navy.
The
Yes, sir. That's us.
It's a miracle.
That isn't a miracle.
It's American seamanship.
-That's a great welcome for you, Joe.
-Not for me, Cap. It's for the ship.
Put your heaving line on the dock!
-Hey, what does that mean,
-That means, "comrade." That's good.
Comrade, comrade.
That's the first time I ever wanted to kiss
a longshoreman.
What's wrong, Joe?
I'm just thinking about the trip back.
