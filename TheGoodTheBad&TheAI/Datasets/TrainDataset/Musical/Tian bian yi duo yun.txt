Watch this
contestant attack his slice.
And it's a new record!
It's a battle to consume
the most watermelon
in the shortest time.
this one wants the plate too!
And now for the
pip-spitting competition.
this contestant's meager performance
causes general hilarity.
Even the children beat him.
this one has the knack,
he spits it more than 30 feet!
but with no front teeth,
you drop your pip before you spit!
The price of watermelon
is now so low
that it's more profitable
to sell the juice
and the market is awash!
Guess the price of a 24 oz. jug?
Cheaper than mineral water!
Everybody's drinking it
and now ex-congressmen
want in on the market.
Look at the figures:
this juice bar
is taking in 50,000 dollars a day.
that's a cool.
And watermelon can open your heart!
It's the ideal way to send a message.
Of course
In this summer day
there's no better
or cheaper method!
It lets you express
what you can't say out loud.
there's a whole lovers' code:
a small yellow one
means you're just good friends.
A big red one
means you're wildly in love.
And regular melons,
despite their small size,
are reserved
for the most ardent passion!
Here you see
a group of students,
too shy to declare their love,
going out with "guardian angels "
friends dressed as watermelons
to deliver watermelons
to the girls' dormitories.
When the girls receive them
they blush,
and their hearts swell with pride.
the river bed is almost dry,
even upstream.
these low rain levels
don't normally occur until february.
The dry weather covers a wide area:
the vast majority of rivers
are affected.
A severe drought
can therefore be expected.
Weather patterns in recent years
and low water stocks
are fueling the sense of alarm.
Invest in buckets to store water!
We are going to
suffer a serious drought
but water,buy bucket,keep water.
Our sales are up 150%.
business is booming.
Get your water buckets here!
Top quality guaranteed!
The Yilan mineral water company
has trebled its output.
Two-gallon flagons
are especially in demand.
Not only flagons,
suppliers of water-coolers
are also delighted
and have stepped up deliveries
to 7 days a week.
Taiwan is in the grips of panic
over the widespread drought.
The main reservoir
has become a cause for concern.
the water level,
which is still falling,
is now only 107 feet.
Taps are dry from 2 pm to 10 pm
and everyday life is in turmoil.
What are you looking for?
My keys.
Ain't no keys here.
Move out of the way.
Don't stand there.
Listen, lady,
there ain't no keys here.
It's dangerous.
We got work to do.
There ain't no keys.
Stop hanging around.
There ain't no keys, I said.
The strategy from Congress
is to invoke higher authority.
Taiwan is so dry.
May there be rains from on high
from our people and Congress,
hear our cry!
Do you want rain in Taiwan?
Yes.
Do you want rain in Taiwan?
Yes.
What's up?
She's got ants.
Here.
No nightingale's sweet tune
No flowers in bloom
Can soothe my heart so blue
I look out from my room
Amid my gloom
And there alone is a half-moon
No bright shining star
No cloud from afar
Only in my dreams do I find you
I've only my memories
to carry me through
And there alone is that half-moon
the poor moon's torn apart
It's lost half its heart
Is it shining down there on you?
Our old dreams
never will come true
Cold neon lights
Long shadows in the night
They make my lonesome soul so blue
the night breeze stirs in my room
And still alone is that half-moon
The night breeze stirs in my room
And still alone is that half-moon
Are you still selling watches?
The first day that we met
We knew we never would forget
this everlasting love
Such unforgettable love
Like the two wings of a dove
Side by side up above
Look at me,
don't be sulky, don't be sulky
I'll be everything you need
the first day that we met
We knew we never would forget
this everlasting love
Such unforgettable love
As two trees grow intertwined
the highest love we will find
Look at me,
stand by me, stand by me
I'll be everything you need
the first day that we met
We knew we never would forget
this everlasting love
Such unforgettable love
As two trees grow intertwined
the highest love we will find
Look at me,
stand by me, stand by me
I'll be everything you need
the first day that we met
We knew we never would forget
this everlasting love
Such unforgettable love
How could we forget
the day that we met
No more water?
I don't believe this!
Go get some!
Get a move on!
I can't find my eyelashes!
Can you see my lashes?
What?
I haven't a sou
but a heart, yes I do
And this heart, I tell you.
Is loving and warm
but so sad and forlorn.
I've been so often betrayed
by men brutal and jaded.
So often degraded.
And so, come what may
I'd throw everything away
Rather than lead my heart astray
I haven't a sou
I'd sell my soul too
to keep my heart true
to keep my heart true
I haven't a sou
I'd sell my soul too
to keep my heart true
to keep my heart true
I crawl out of bed
And shake my sleepy head
Suddenly it dawns on me
I got the whole day free
I have a date with lovely Chen,
I must look good, but then
I see my shoes, what a fright
the left foot's on the right!
Already I am running late
I mustn't make her wait
I see her with her back to me
She looks like harmony
to show her that I think she's bliss
I plant a big wet kiss
She turns around and punches me
It wasn't Chen, you see
Later comes the real Miss Chen
It's way past 12 by then
I tell her that I hate to wait
And ask her why she's late
She still has slippers on
Her skirt is hitched up wrong
turns out that she's as scared as me
And nervous as can be
Oh what fun we had that day
the time just slipped away
We danced and had a walk
And sat down for a talk
but when I see it's time to go
Oh, what a fearful blow
She wasn't Chen, her name was
Hsiao And she thought I was Zhao
the cap's inside the Japanese girl.
Lin
What do you want?
Fish that cap out.
Need a hand?
Don't look down, don't look back.
Look straight ahead
and find your track
Follow it with a fearless stride
And happiness will be your prize
Gently let your spirits rise
Walk straight
on with head held high
All obstacles you'll put aside
for happiness you need to strive
be sure to keep
your eyes on the goal
And share your joy with one and all
follow the path with fearless stride
And happiness will be your prize
Gently let your spirits rise
Walk straight
on with head held high
All obstacles you'll put aside
for happiness you have to strive
Don't look down, don't look back
Look straight ahead
and find your track
follow it with a fearless stride
And happiness will be your prize
Gently let your spirits rise
Walk straight
on with head held high
All obstacles you'll put aside
for happiness
you need to strive-
back to work.

A wayward cloud...
Lonesome and proud.
Slipping through my hand
to a far-off land
My heartless love
Drifting high above
Drifting high above
Like a wayward cloud
With no earthly bound
His lonely hours pass like
wilting flowers
As he watches life drift by
A sole shadow, with the world below
Like a wayward cloud
A wayward cloud
Lonesome and proud
Slipping through my hand
to a far-off land
My heartless love
Drifting high above
Drifting high above
Like a wayward cloud
My love like to travel around the world
Everywhere is home the wind blow
he horse run
travel to far-off land
and leave me behind
thinking of him day and night
A sole shadow,
with the world below
Like a wayward cloud
My heartless love
Drifting high above
Drifting high above
Like a wayward cloud
With no earthly bound
