Let the evil eye not fall on you.
I wonder which Prince is
going to carry you away!
Go, Mother.
Madam
- Yes Pichumani?
Flowers.. fell from your hair!
Oh! Give it to me.
- Let me do it myself!
Ok. I should go now.
Karthik..
..start the music as
soon as Pichumani puts the..
..flowers in her hair.
Ready, sir.
Viji.
- I am ready, sir.
The girl runs, Pichumani
is playing the flute..
.. and until he calls for her..
..and check out the special tone..
..for the begging
bowl crashing down.
I shall rock it.
- Okay. Okay, take.
Let the evil eye not fall on you.
I wonder which Prince is
going to carry you away!
Go, mother.
Madam..
- Yes Pichumani?
Flowers.. fell from your hair!
Oh! Give it to me.
- Let me do it myself!
Ok.
That sitar note you hit
when that Girl got shy..
..gave me Goosebumps!
- Yes..
..as if you played for Benhur
and Brave heart before this!
You have been doing the same
damn thing throughout the year.
He may hear you!
She is the landlord's daughter,
and he is just a beggar.
Just putting flowers in her hair,
how can love find its way?
He's a Hero! That's why..
What if you and I did the same?
- Police will find their way!
I pity these Landlord's
daughters in Tamil Cinema
Why?
They all seem to find only
beggars to fall in love.
Viji, are you ready?
- Okay sir, play.
How is it?
Beautiful.
So calm and peaceful
What are you doing?
Uncle! Don't move
Enemies are attacking us
Enemies?
Viji.. what is this?
We have a Terrorist
unit at our doorstep
They are just children.
It's so Beautiful and Calm again
Excuse me, where is Flat no 17 B?
That's unoccupied. Why
are you enquiring about it?
We are moving in there.
I handle the Security
and Maintenance here
In short, I have total control!
My name is Karthik.
This is Viji.
Straight this way.
Last block. First Floor.
Hello, how are you? I am fine.
Excuse me.. excuse me.
Your kerchief.
It fell down.
Thank you.
- What is it?
Thank you.
Its all right!
I just returned her Handkerchief.
Why is she getting so emotional?
Why are you laughing?
Was just thinking..
.. of you as Pichumani, and she
, the Landlord's Daughter!
Its very important to be
friendly with the neighbours.
Ring the Bell
V. Ananthakrishnan,
Chartered Accountant.
Yes.
- Hello, sir.
We are your new neighbours.
- Please come in.. come.. come.
I am Ananthakrishnan.
I am Karthik. He is Viji.
Sit.. sit. Please be seated.
I am the secretary of this
apartment. Janu. - I am coming.
My wife Janu!
Greetings. - Boiled Milk
from our house warming pooja.
Our new neighbours!
My son.
- His name is Arjun
Where are you working?
We are musicians. Keyboard Players.
You play in stage shows.
No. We are from the Film Industry.
Heard of Music director Vidyasagar!
Yes!
We play for his songs
Songs from the movie Chandramukhi?
Yes! We played those.
Is it so? ' Can't you
speak for a while..'
'..pampering me?'
Oh I just love that song.
You sing so beautifully.
Thank you. Even our son
Arjun is learning the keyboard.
He is really interested in music.
I can see that.
If you could teach him music,
when you are free..
Sure! With pleasure.
Seems like you cook well too
Just as beautifully as you sing.
The aroma from the kitchen is great.
If you don't mind,
could you give us some..
Definitely! I'll bring it, as
soon as the cooking is over..
Liking your apartment?
Yes. Very much.
When is your family arriving?
They aren't coming.
I'm staying here alone.
Mother's with brother in Delhi.
Viji stays with me on and off
You aren't married?
Not yet. He just
returned her Handkerchief.
No, not yet.
- Not me either.
You go inside.
You go inside, Janu.
You mean, you are bachelors?
We should be, since
we are not married..
See Mr. Karthik, there has
been a mistake Some where..
I think so too! In his Horoscope.
According to our Apartment Rules..
..we don't allow
Bachelors to stay here!
Why?
There were 4 who stayed here..
..created too many problems.
Since then we don't
allow any bachelors.
We had sent all house
owners a notice on this.
But our house owner
lives in South Africa
I know
That is why we sent him an email!
I assure you we aren't
those kind of Bachelors.
We are the more decent ones
like Abdul Kalam and Vajpayee.
You won't even notice us here.
We leave home early
and come back late.
We've paid an advance of Rs. 2 Lacs.
Sorry. Isn't there
something called Rules?
Its better you look elsewhere.
Let's not discuss this now
We'll have a word with the
house owner and get back to you.
Come on, Viji.
Where are you going?
That Vessel is ours!
Drink lots of Milk! You
will be the next Dhoni.
It's difficult for
bachelors to find a flat.
Thinking practically there
seems to be only one solution.
And that is..
- What for that?
You getting married.
It's also your mother's dream
Your mother's as well.
Why don't you get married?
As a bachelor they
won't give you a Flat!
As a bachelor they
won't even give me a girl!
Shut up, Viji.
- I am serious.
That Secretary chap.. even
he found himself a Girl.
Tell your mom to find you a girl.
One doesn't get married like that !
It has to happen on its own.
What?
First I should see
the girl of my dreams.
When I see her I will know that..
.. I can spend the
rest of my life with her.
What?
You are making me teary eyed!
Don't pull my leg
How will you know she is the one?
That's how it is.
Like in Comic Books, there'll be
a Bulb glowing over your head..
.. ringing of bells ..
For that you should be an
Electrician or a Bell Boy!
Such things don't happen.
They will.
What to do with the
Secretary till then.
Before your bulb glows, he'll
pull the Fuse. - Let him be.
Talk of Romance, and
passions are ignited.
Hasn't such a thought
ever occurred to you?
You mean, with Bells ringing
and Bulbs glowing. Actually, I..
Better you keep quiet.
Whatever!
Let the bloody tomatoes rot!
How dare you avoid me!
I will kill you.
Leave me alone. You drunk rascal.
I'm a man. I'll do as I please.
What kind of a man are you.
Can't take care of your wife!
How dare you question me!
Remove your nose
ring and give it to me?
I'll kill you
Give me the money!
I know it's in your saree.
Don't be impertinent
to the man you belong to
Don't hit me!
Who are you? Holding my hand!
Who do you think you are?
A Supercop? Leave me.
I will do as I please with my wife.
Nobody around dare ask me.
I'll let you go, as you're a woman.
If a man had hit me..
..that would've been the end.
You dare hit me? Do you know who..!
Stop staring. Help me
Oh God! Am seeing Double.
You hired her to
beat me up, didn't you!
Instead of telling me all this..
..why don't you ask her straight..
..the Bulb glowed, Bell rang,
when can we get married?
She left in the
auto before I could..
What a woman she was. So Brave!
Just like my mother.
You mean she was an old woman!
I meant like my mother.
My mother is just like that.
Once, this guy stole her handbag..
..you should have seen her
beat him up on the road.
Even I was scared to touch
that handbag after that!
I get it!
Scoring music for
too many action films..
.. has messed you up.
Who could she be?
Well she could be..
Never mind! Don't say anything..
Whatever!

I somehow don't think
Beethoven's birthday..
.. is cause enough for us to booze!
What?
He's a musician. We must
celebrate his birthday.
It's not like we drink everyday..
Last we drank was for
Michael Jackson's birthday!
Which was last week!
That's his problem.
I am done. Bill!
Here.. finish the Chicken.
There is too much Garlic in this.
Karthik..
Garlic is very good for health.
If you have garlic everyday, one
in the morning and one at night..
.. you'll live for a 100 years.
My grandpa used to say that.
Not only did he say,
he lived it by example.
Really?
But the poor bugger died at 62!
How?
Well, he came out of bath,
dried his towel, sneezed. And died.
But the Garlic..?
There are somethings in life..
..which even Garlic can't save!
Can you believe this?
I am high on beer
That's because you hardly ever drink
So you ARE
suggesting I drink everyday?!
Hello.
- Hello.
I am Priti.
I am Karthik.
I am Inzamam-Ul-Haq.
Can she not see me?
I heard you are a Musician
- Yes
I am also learning the Guitar
If you ever drop your Kerchief..
..on the guitar
he'll return it to you
Can she still not see me?
Let me not stop you. Good night.
Good night.
Wait.
There, she bumped
into something! Let's go
Why did you say you
are Inzamam-Ul-Haq?
Would she have fallen in Love
with me if I said I was Viji?
Noticed one thing about Beer?
Once drunk one even burps beer.
Don't make noise
Viji.. What are you doing?
What is this? What is this,
Viji? He might come.
It's the Secretary
What are you doing?
What's this? In front of
the Secretary's house?
What if he comes..
What is this? What's happening here?
How dare you vomit outside my house?
It's not what you're thinking.
It's his birthday.
Happy Birthday, sir.
So? If it's your birthday..
..you will puke
outside everybody's house?
I never puked on my last birthday.
Are you joking?
Know who I am?
Secretary of this apartment.
Just a minute, sir.
What's he saying?
Viji.
- Let me talk to him
No need for that.
- I will talk to him.
If you want to vomit
go to the bathroom
Do we have Garlic at home?
Viji, get in.
Just that he had some Beer.
It didn't quite agree with him
Trying to fool me?
That's why we don't allow Bachelors.
I'll have this cleaned in 5 minutes
Think of this as a bad Vomit,
I mean, a bad Dream!
What?
What are you doing here again?
Actually he seems to be
puking more than he even drank!
This is the limit.
Yes, this is the limit.
I'll call the police.
Why Police?
Want us to vacate? We will vacate.
Just give us a little time.
- How long? Half an hour?
We've to find another house
- 1 hour?
Sir.. please.
- How much time do you want?
How about 2 years?
Would that be enough?
Take 5 years. I'll call the police.
Janu, get my cell phone.
We'll vacate immediately sir.
We'll look for
another house right away.
Go. Get going.
I'll call the police.
- What's that noise there?
Nothing! Don't come out..
You are not my Friend.
Just my screwed up Fate!
Didn't I spell it out to you?
If you want to puke
go to the bathroom.
Why did you come out again?
Wasn't that the bathroom?
Which?
- Where I threw up?
Hey.. hey.
I was wondering..
..what the Secretary was
doing in our bathroom.
Sorry, Karthik.
I will wash away my own sins
What are you going to wash away?
I sat all night
washing away your mess
I am going to apologize
- What?
I'll say that the Bird Flu
got me, will get some sympathy
Not necessary.
Have told him, we'll
vacate this place.
That bad?
- He threatened to call the Police.
Start looking for another house.
Leave this to me
The way I beg for forgiveness..
.. he is going to
come to you, and sob.
Viji is going to the bathroom,
Having a bath..
..Changing, meeting him and
finishing this once and for all.
Wait and Watch what
happens in half an hour!
Hey.
Karthik.
''Is it the moon that I
see through my window?''
''Is she the one I lost on the road?''
''What I saw, what I see..
Is it but a dream?''
''Is it my muse
right in front of me?''
''The dove that flew away
disappeared behind the clouds''
''But when I came home and saw It
was in my garden tittering about''
''She disappeared through the
streets but fate took me to her''
''This makes me believe
That love has blossomed truly''
Good Morning.
My name is Karthik.
Newly moved in here.
You may not know me, but I know you
Remember last week, that
guy beating up his wife..
..you beat him up and threw him
into the garbage. It was amazing.
Wanted your autograph right away
Before I could cross
the road, you had gone
Wanted to appreciate what you did
As I said before, I am Karthik,
May I know your name?
Jnana Prakasham.
Jnana Prakasham?
Professor Jnana Prakasham.
- Oh! Karthik.
Where do you work?
I am a musician. I work in Films
Oh! Very good.
I ardently listen
to Tamil Film songs.
There's this latest song..
It's a nice song.
I like that song a lot
I think it's based on Bhimplus raga.
I also enjoy Tamil Movies.
There's a new
director called Mani Ratnam.
Brilliant boy.
He'll become a great director.
Mark my words.
He'll go places. Mr.
Raghavan, stop there.
How can you ride
without your helmet?
I forgot it in the office.
No. The Police will surely catch you
Even Chief Minister MGR has
said so in a recent interview.
Got caught with the Professor?
Who is he? Talks funny.
He's a well read man
- Really?
Didn't notice the bald head?
Was a Professor in a University.
Now is slightly mentally off.
Thinks we are all
still in the year 1984.
Why is that?
Well that is because..
Switch the motor off
Am going to switch the motor off.
We'll talk in detail later.
It's this way. Fengshui
is confusing everything..
Going late to school?
If you go late,
you'll miss your lessons.
Then how will you
become a Great person?
'The one who sleeps in
school misses Knowledge'..
.. sang a great man
Mark my words.
Discipline is a must.
Such loud music.. so
early in the morning?
Nuisance!
Hello..
Anybody home?
Please help. Something
has happened to him.
What?
Don't know. Something
seems to have frightened him.
He is not responding
He did this on purpose.
Who? What?
Your friend. Why was he like that?
Like what?
I won't even look at the
face of someone I don't like
And he made me..
Please bring a hot cup of Tea.
For me.
What are you looking at? Its For me!
Now tell me
Leave that. When are you vacating?
Vacate? What for?
Didn't you promise
to vacate last night?
But I didn't even see you last night
Didn't see at all? This is too much.
Last night after your friend puked..
..didn't you say you would vacate?
Last night we were in Singapore
Singapore?
- We came in only this morning.
Can you prove it?
Thousands come from
Singapore everyday..
..are they all proving it?
A Drunk's words cannot be trusted.
For the last time,
When are you vacating?
Don't you know the
rules of the apartment?
Isn't this apartment
within the Indian Boundaries?
In the Indian Penal Code
show me where it says..
..Bachelors can't
stay in Apartments.
I'll vacate immediately.
I swear on Ambedkar.
With all due respect..
..I think you have
Multiple Personality Disorder.
So calm outside, but
like a beast inside
Consult a doctor immediately.
What did you do to that man?
I didn't DO anything on purpose!
Tell me. No point
keeping it under covers.
I should have kept it covered.
But before I could..
What?
He saw me Shame Shame puppy shame!
Oh God! How did this happen?
Well I came out of the shower
and was bathing in some music..
..the tempo dropped
and so did my towel.
This is the worst
punishment a man can get!
Get lost! Actually
why don't we vacate..
Why should we vacate?
You asked me to look
out for another house
When you went to the bathroom,
I saw from the balcony.
You also saw me?
No stupid. I saw my angel.
Who?
My Rani of Jhansi.
Really?
She stays right here..
in our complex.
Even if the army comes to
evict me, I am not leaving!
Then the Secretary?
If you want, get even
and see his Puppy shame!
Yuck! No!
Good shot. Do you like
cricket, Babu? - Yes
Did you see the match last week?
Which match?
India Australia match. We lost
by 46 runs. Didn't you watch?
Yes. I watched it.
Hardly been a year since
we won the world cup..
.. and they are losing so badly.
It's a shame.
Youngsters should
come into the team.
Gavaskar should retire.
- Ah! You correct.
There is this young
man from Hyderabad.
Very brilliant player.
Should play for India very soon.
Mark my words.
He'll be the captain of
Indian Cricket team one day.
His name is..
Hello. Good Evening.
The name of American
president is George Bush.
British Prime
Minister's name is Tony Blair.
Latest James Bond's
name is Daniel Greig.
Why I am saying
all this is because..
..I know the names of these
people from round the world.
But staying in the same apartment..
..shouldn't I know your name?
Azharuddin. The Hyderabad player..
..I mentioned, his name
is Mohammad Azharuddin.
Very good player, Babu.
He is a good fielder too.
Even recently he played very
well in the Ranji Trophy Finals.
He is a very
promising player, you know.
And who is there after Kapil Dev?
We need another genuine fast bowler.
Even Madanlal has grown older now.
Every now come here.
- What happened to the old lady?
Sister, Grandma fell down.
What happened?
- Nothing to worry, Babu.
Might have been on empty stomach.
Just take her to a doctor. Quick.
Know any doctor? Or
should I go to a Hospital?
Know Grandma's blood group?
Patient's relative?
Name of the Patient please.
Please tell me the name.
Why don't you just say it?
What's your problem?
You're not answering
I am sorry.
Must have been fasting.
Nothing to worry about.
Better to stay here tonight.
Grandma.. She is alright..
Nothing to worry
Better she stays here tonight.
Oh! It's okay.
''From the depth of her
eyes she spoke poetry''
''With beautiful gestures
she communicated freely''
''But through sounds she
can never speak to me''
''Silence is not a handicap''
''Words do not mean true perfection''
''Her face is enough for me
to speak language truly..''
Sometimes God can be so Cruel.
Let it be. Am sure your
bulb will glow elsewhere!
No, it's now burning brighter.
When I first saw her I
wanted a girl like her..
.. now I've decided..
it's her I want.
How?
Think about it. You are a musician.
You want to
accomplish something in music.
I can understand..
..if the woman in your life
doesn't understand music..
.. but if she cant hear it even?
Why should she hear it.
You know that music
is felt, not heard.
That's why music needs no language.
And neither does Love.
When we score music for a film..
..don't we leave portions
of the film with no music?
Doesn't that silence
have so much beauty.
I can love her silence too.
It doesn't mean that I
am giving her a life
I just want to share mine with her.
I think we will be happy
Be happy! So what are
you going to do next?
I've collected details about
her. She is a school teacher.
What?
A school for people like her.
She has a friend called Sheela.
Works in the same school.
We should speak to her
How will she talk?
- She can talk fine.
If we meet her we can
find out more about Archana.
You know you are lucky in Two ways!
- How?
Your wife won't talk unnecessarily..
..she won't bother if
you play rotten music.
Where do we meet Sheela?
Go and talk
She's gone
Yes I can see that
Stop her and talk
What do I speak with her?
Don't know if you've
starting trouble..
..but I don't think her bike does!
I'll stop her . You
think of something fast
Hello. Hello, Madam..
Excuse me, stop.. stop. Stop.
- Yes.
License?
- Who are you?
CBI. - So, why do you
ask for the license?
We can ask anything.
Got a license or not?
How do I believe you're
from the CBI? - Good question.
Let me walk away. Call
out CBI, I'll surely turn.
Joking?
I've been watching you. Is
this how you behave in a church?
One second ma'am.
Sorry to trouble you
Who are you?
- He is LIC. I mean CBI
I'll call the police.
It's not what you're thinking.
I need to discuss something with you
What?
About your friend Archana
Archana?
What about her?.
There's a proposal for her.
Boy's name is Karthik
Plays the keyboard. I'm a
great guy. He's even better!
Who?
Please don't misunderstand.
I stay in the same place as Archana.
When Archana's grandma
fell sick yesterday..
..I was the one who
rushed her to the hospital.
I need to talk to
you for ten minutes.
Please.
There are somethings in
life that make you wonder why.
Archana is one of them.
She was 3, when they found
out she had this defect.
After that, her dad slowly
moved away from her and her mother.
Being a single
mother took its toll,..
.. so, she never got the love..
.. and affection a child
of her age should get.
Then her father found another
woman and moved out completely.
At the age of six
she lost her mother.
From then, her
grandmother has been her everything
Watching her parents fight,
made her a violent child.
She expects nothing from no one.
She despises sympathy,..
.. and expects
everyone to appreciate her.
For that she studied well,
learnt to paint,..
.. sculpt and even
learnt Karate and Kungfu.
Yes I saw that
If she starts hating something..
..then it's difficult to
change her mind about it.
And she generally feels
men are not to be trusted
Come, let's go..
No wait.
I believe I can give her the love
she didn't get from her parents.
Don't ask me why I
feel this, I don't know.
I don't know you from before.
But you are asking about
Archana in front of God,..
.. I believe you will be true.
Will she understand
when we speak with her?
If you see her face and talk,
she can read your lips
Doesn't she have any other family?
Her guardian. Mr Ananthakrishnan
I have heard this name before
Stays in the same apartment
In fact he is the
apartment secretary
Okay, bye.
- Yes, bye.
Hey, Karthik.. usually Love
happens, then comes the villain..
.. and with him, the problem.
Here the problem is ready,
and the villain awaits us.
Who next? Grandma?
Coffee.
Thanks.
Sheela told me everything.
But who is to tell Archana all this?
Do you see that?
There was one more Vase,
just like that.
spoke to her about..
..getting married and she broke it.
Really?
You don't know about her anger.
Sometime back, at the neighbour's..
.. a young boy had
come from the army.
He fell for her and said, I Love you
She punched his nose in return..
..and he went
running back, to Kashmir.
Don't say a thing!
But we can't just leave it, can we?
Want to call him back from Kashmir?
I mean we should be advising her
What do you want me to do?
I will handle it.
All I need is your consent
I was worried about her future
I will be glad to
see her settle down.
Your husband is
pestering us to vacate.
Ignore him. You just go ahead
Just make sure there are
no problems with him..
All routes seem clear.
The next person is the Secretary
I must find a place in his heart
Even Aunty failed there!
Where do you stand?
Be serious. This is no time to joke.
That Fat Cream Bun Arjun..
Who?
- The Secretary's Fatso Son.
I will teach him the keyboards and..
.. make him a little Rehman,
within a month.
Now you are joking.
- We have no choice.
I'll go to the beach..
..cry out my woes and
commit the sin. - All the best.
Have to wake up at 5.30 am
Delivering milk?
No am going Jogging.
- What? Why?
Archana goes jogging everyday.
- Alone?
With her Dog.
- She won't need you then!
Good night.
Professor, this is too much.
Did you say something?
Who else to inform?
And you're sleeping ..
What's your plan?
What can I do?
Mr. Ananthakrishnan..
You don't realize the
seriousness of the situation.
The consequences could be very bad.
You are the right man for this!
- What happened ?
How can you act as
if you know nothing?
MGR is unwell, has
been admitted in hospital
What can I do? Am I a doctor?
He doesn't even look educated.
Educated in an MBBS I mean!
See? How irresponsible he is
Not like that.
It is. MGR is a great leader.
They suspect a Brain Tumour.
If something happens..
.. it will be a law & order problem.
There won't be newspapers,
nor milk..
I'll deliver milk in
your house. Happy?
Even the newspaper.
- Did I ask you?
Just supporting you
- Not necessary
I have a helping nature.
That's why. - Shut up.
Mr. Ananthakrishnan, You are
the secretary of this apartment.
Instead of speaking of security..
.. you are talking like a milk boy.
Wait till the next election.
We'll show you who we are.
Mark my words. Your
days are numbered.
Jnana Prakasham, you
are talking too much.
No, you are talking too much.
You shut up. Take him away.
Call that security.
Don't worry, sir. Look, I will..
..support you. In the next election,
at least by
casting ten false votes..
..I shall make you win.
- Janu, go inside.
Irresponsible idiot.
- Sir, nothing will happen to MGR.
They'll take him to America.
His ministers will
also accompany him.
He will also win the next election.
How?
- His horoscope says so!
See. He is answering me responsibly.
Mark my words. He will
be the next secretary.
Let that be for now.
Just go home and rest.
Whether there's milk or not,
your coffee will taste the same!
Thank you so much son..
Its ok
It's not that.
Everybody is always making
fun of him and ridiculing him.
You are the only one
who speaks to him kindly
How did this happen to him?
We had a son.
He was in his 12th class,
when he met with an accident
In 1984?
As soon as we got the call..
.. he was shocked and shaken.
He doesn't know anything
that happened thereafter.
He didn't even shed a tear.
If he had broken down and cried,
this may not have happened.
He never recovered from that shock.
As far as he is concerned,..
..this world came to a
stand still that day in 1984.
Was your son's name Babu?
That's what we called him
Sir calls me Babu.
If he had been alive, he
would have been like you.
Oh! Good morning.
How is grandma?
Grandma?
You are asking if I jog every day?
Yes. Me, daily. 5
'o' clock.. jogging.
Remember sometime back
there was floods in the city?
I jogged even then.
Your dog.
Your dog? Very cute.
I love dogs.
So sweet.. pupy dear.
We want sixer.. we want sixer..
We want sixer.. we want sixer..
We want sixer.. we want sixer.
We want sixer.. we want sixer.
Yeah!
- Ahh..h!
Karthik, you went like a Hero
and came back like an Item Girl?
Was showing
Archana's dog, my affection.
He didn't return my feelings
Heard you broke
athletic records in Chennai.
Shut up!
I heard from the
Apartment kids. Am proud of you!
Didn't realize..
..that a Giant Beast could
be within such a small Dog?!
You?
Hello aunty. How come
you've come here alone?
What happened?
It's ok. Control yourself.
Whatever it is, tell me.
But please in Tamil..
.. since I don't know Chinese.
What happened to your nose?
Nose?
Shut up, the stitches will come off
Hello Doctor, how come you are here?
Convey my regards to
every one at home.
Viji, It hurts like crazy.
Doctor poked me,
all around my navel.
What did you expect?
Spin a top around it?
Hi.
I heard, a dog bit you?
Even you know about it!
Where did it bite you?
Started in Adyar, then
it bit me in Besant Nagar
Where did it bite you on your body?
Nowhere in particular.
Everywhere in general.
I want to see.
Is this a national
heritage for public viewing?
No college?
I took leave today
Why?
- Didn't feel like going
Can I stay and look after you?
No need. Please leave me alone..
Won't you understand my feelings?
The doctor gave me heavy
injections, I feel dizzy.
Need to rest. Do me a small favour?
What is it?
A small favour..
Close the door on your way out.
Won't you understand my feelings?
What do I do with this girl?
Be fair! She has the same disease.
Looking at you all
her bulbs are glowing!
You heard only one bell
but she heard a million
She is back
Must be someone else.
Tell them I am indisposed.
How come I am
always invisible to her?
Please come in.
HI, please come in.. come.
This is my friend Viji.
I'm Sheela. Yes, I know that.
- Viji. Please sit down. Come.
She says I'm sorry
Apologizing for
such a trivial thing.
She says this dog
has never bitten anyone
It was totally unexpected
It's ok. It hardly bit me.
Just a scratch here
and a minor peck there.
Don't worry about me. Am
perfectly all right actually.
She says your house..
My house is very beautiful, right?
Thank you. First
time you have come home.
Coffee.. coffee.
No, we are late for school.
You should come another
day for Coffee definitely.
Okay.
- Okay bye.
Get well soon.
- Oh! Thank you. Bye bye.
I have a question.
Archana said something
and Sheela explained it.
Then you replied
and Sheela explained.
I have a small doubt.
Does this mean Sheela
will be with you forever?
Nobody else can think from
such a strange perspective.
But you are correct. I
will learn that as well.
Learn what ?
Sign language.

Viji.. Viji.
What is it?
Why are you pestering me?
What is your problem?
I said your name is Viji
Did I say, my name is Padayappa?
I was practicing.
Don't act so irresponsibly.
Good Morning.
- Good morning.
Good evening.
- Good evening.
Good Night.
- Good Night.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just a minute.
Don't misunderstand..
..but how does one say 'I love you!'
Viji.
- What?
Arrested the Producer? Who
the hell is going to Pay us?
Feeling cold? Why didn't you say so?
I said 'I Love you'.
I am just the person
who should hear that!
Who is this?
Grandma
Grandpa?
Grandpa
Who is this?
Means?
My husband
Are you serious?
Yes. Died within a year of
their marriage in an accident.
Was shocked when I heard it
Everyone seems to have a sad past
- the Professor..
..Archana and now Sheela.
I guess that's how Life is.
The other day at the hospital..
..Archana explained
her condition to me..
.. with so much
dignity and self respect.
I could see her belief in
Life, beyond her handicap.
Today I saw the
same thing in Sheela.
Its true.
They are younger than us, but we
have so much to learn from them!
Hey.. just pass it.
Good Morning.
My name is Karthik..
Karthik.
Your name is Archana..
Archana.
That is a Dog.
Angry Dog.
Sorry sir.
No.. no.. no. It's okay.
Be there it self. Be there.
Okay.. okay.
Now, watch.

Good Morning.
- Good Morning, Babu.
Today is my birthday!
Bless me, sir.
- Babu.
Here take this book.
Thank you, sir.
This book will be
very useful to you.
In fifteen years time..
..the world will
depend on Computers.
Writer Sujata has
also written about this.
Nobody listens, when I tell them.
Read this book..
..and any doubts, you ask me!
Anytime, okay?
What's your Star sign?
Chitirai
That is Virgo.
- Right
Am going to the temple. I'll
make an offering in your name.
Krishnan, dispose this
Omni at the earliest..
..and there is a model
called Maruti 1000. Buy that.
Very good mileage. Good pick up.
Good Morning.
- Oh! That. It's my birthday today.
Thank you.
My mom called. I was talking to her.
That's why late!
Professor gave me this as
birthday gift. Yes.. yes.
But nobody understands him here.
What else to do.
As usual. With friends..
party and hotel.
Something useful? Like what?
I have never seen you here before.
Thanks for volunteering
such a generous donation.
Thank you so much.
- No mother.
You're doing so much good.
Its only a donation.
God bless you. Many happy returns.
- Thank you, Mother.
Where is Archana?
They're clapping for you!
Wishing you for your birthday
This is for your donation!
I've celebrated many birthdays.
This one will be unforgettable.
Home?
Come in son
Is it? Happy Birthday!
You drew this?
The Moon.
Oh. The Moon.
The moon reminds me of this story..
..my mother used to tell me
Tale.. Story!
If we miss someone a lot..
..then think of them
and look at the moon,
you will see their face in it.
I used to love my grand mom.
Whenever I missed her,..
..I used to see the moon
and I could see her face.
Your mom never told you stories?
Do you miss anybody?
You don't miss anybody?
Soap!
You made this? Wow!
For me?
Gift. Thank you.
Here you are. Shall we start?
Ok. Your first lesson.
Is this a keyboard?
Yes, Uncle.
A Keyboard should not be
used as a dining table! Ok?
Ok, Uncle.
- You are already half Rehman!
No. Wait. First I will teach you.
You play, and then eat one pakoda.
- Okay, Uncle.
Keep your fingers here and..
Cdef.. Gapc.
You are teaching me A B
C D in the wrong order?
Oh my little genius you! See this..
sa ri ga ma pa da ni sa.
sa ri ga ma pa da ni sa.
You seem to be doing
only one thing right!
Keep at it.
Keep practicing, I'll be right back
Hey that boy..
What the hell is this?
There is music in a violin.
Can a Violin become Music?
That fatso is better off..
Isn't Archana also
like that? What happened?
I was thinking
- what if like Archana,
I could also not
hear your nutty laments
Correct. I was thinking jus that.
I want to know what
her world is like.
Great! Do one thing.
Like Gandhari in Mahabharath..
..going blind after marriage..
..to see her husband's
world; you also shut your ears..
- Brilliant idea.
Hey! Are you nuts?
Please, Viji.
I have already stuffed 2
rolls of cotton into your ears.
If I have to stuff
more I need Cement.
Can't you hear me?
Is that so? Ok
Am leaving now
Am so proud of you man
No. Don't have to come with me.
Poor child! Seems to
have finally lost it
Don't be a fool to think
that she'll love you..
..if you do such stupid things
Remember, you
watch planes fly high..
..while we fly in those very planes.
Understand this and back
off. I am warning you.
Okay, break.
Did you hear that female's voice?
Doesn't that Sound like
the director dubbed for her?
Hey what is it?
No, Viji..
If Archana had a voice,
how would it sound?
It could sound like
that scary lady's voice
It'll sound like
Lata Mangeshkar's voice.
Have you heard her talking?
No
Some people who sing well,
sound awful talking.
Haven't you heard that?
Archana's voice will sound perfect
Have it your way!
I never thought of this!
- What?
No, Viji. Think about it.
Archana talks to
me in sign language.
What if I imagine a
voice for her when she does.
I don't understand
Whenever she talks to me..
..I will hear a beautiful
voice that I will imagine.
Like a dubbed film?!
Waste of time talking to you!
Where are you going?
Am going to listen to her voice.
She'll be thrilled to know
she has a beautiful voice.
You keep plucking on your chords.
We have heard of 1330 Tirukkurals..
..but he has set out
to hear one extra one
Tamilnadu's new discovery!
I came to see you.
Tell me your name
Tell me your name
Archana. Archana.
Tell me my name now
Why?
I will tell you.
First tell me my name
Karthik.. Karthik.
Beautiful.
What are you doing here?
- We have come on a picnic
Yes.
- Wait.
What's all this?
- Your voice is beautiful.
My Voice?
Yes Archana. When you talk I
am imagining a voice for you.
And do you know.. it
sounds so beautiful!
Why do I need a Voice?
When I talk with you
it'll be easier for me.
So you are finding it tough now?
Not tough. But just that
we can get more fluent..
Enough.
If talking to me is so tough,
then don't bother.
No.. Archana, it's not that.
I didn't mean that.
You can hear the
voice you have imagined..
..but I won't because that's not Me.
So when you talk with me..
..will you be talking
to this other person?
Is the real ME so
difficult for you to handle?
I am happy dealing with people
who accept me for what I am.
Why do I need..?
Stop it. Stop imagining a
voice for me. I don't want it
Archana.. Archana. I am sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.
I only meant it in good humour.
What happened?
I didn't understand
what she said last.
I don't have a voice.
Don't need one either
I have nothing to say to this world.
What happened?
I'll speak to you later.
You could've just shut up
Why discover something imaginary
Now just imagine your love life!
I didn't know she'll react this way!
If you want to discover..
..why not something more useful!
Herbal Petrol, Tsunami detectors?
Discovering imaginary voices!
I thought she'd like it
Sure
- Now what do I do?
Sit by yourself and discover
Why are you fighting?
Is this what we struggled for?
What did I do wrong?
Think about it.
So far, you have accepted her..
.. for what she is and
she has got used to that.
Bringing up her voice now..
..only points out
you feel she is flawed.
Her being upset is justified.
What if I..
..told you to imagine
yourself as being beautiful..
Won't it upset you?!
- Hello.
This was a joke!
Please don't stop talking to me.
I realize I have goofed up.
Even when she was telling me off..
..I continued
imagining a voice for her.
I will apologize
Be sure what you are going
to tell her when you meet.
''Oh woman who speaks with her
eyes.. Will you forgive me?''
''I ask you in poetry
Will you forgive me?''
''Oh pure moon Will you forgive me?''
''By mistake I made a
mistake Will you forgive me?''
''Please listen to my plea..
Why are you so angry?''
''Look at me with
your mysterious eyes ..
''..And withdraw your
curses completely..''
''Oh woman who speaks with her
eyes.. Will you forgive me?''
''I ask you in poetry
Will you forgive me?''
''The moon does not
talk That is not a flaw''
''If a flaw is considered beautiful..
..Even life becomes ideal''
''Oh woman I have understood
You being yourself is beauty''
''I will not paint a flower
And draw on it a moustache''
''When you speak with your silence
I will not draw sound from it''
''When the dark
night holds a crescent
Why force a full moon from it''
''My life seems
listless My heart is bitter''
''Gesture that you forgive me
Withdraw your curses completely''
Oh! I'm Sorry.. I'm
sorry.. I'm sorry.
Oh! Oh! I'm sorry..
I'm sorry.. I'm sorry.
''Oh woman who speaks with her
eyes.. Will you forgive me?''
''I ask you in poetry
Will you forgive me?''
''The smile that you wore,
The mischief that you showed,''
''Where did they go?''
''Your eyes holding
the deep blue sea ..
..Of a storm they
seem to be warning me''
''You don't have to cajole
me Just a shrug will do''
''You don't have to be over friendly
Just a half smile will do''
''I don't want an angry
glare Just a glance will do''
''I don't want open doors
Just a window will do''
''My life passes me Days pass me''
''Use your mesmerizing eyes
And give me back my life''
Oh! I'm Sorry.. I'm
sorry.. I'm sorry.
Oh! Oh! I'm sorry..
I'm sorry.. I'm sorry.
''Oh woman who speaks with her
eyes.. Will you forgive me?''
''I ask you in poetry
Will you forgive me?''
''Oh pure moon Will you forgive me?''
''By mistake I made a
mistake Will you forgive me?''
''Please listen to my plea..
Why are you so angry?''
''Look at me with
your mysterious eyes ..
And withdraw your curses completely.
I didn't do it on purpose.
Babu, Please listen.
Babu, stay there. Archana, go home.
Go home.
What is this, Babu?
Walking around
casually at such a time.
What happened?
Indira Gandhi has been assassinated.
She was shot by her own body
guards. 36 bullets, you know.
There are riots in Delhi.
They are killing all Sikhs.
There could be unrest here.
I have locked the front
gate so nobody leaves.
Come here
No point depending
on that secretary.
He is an
irresponsible idiot, you know.
Why don't you buy me
a pair of slippers!
MGR doesn't know this yet.
About your torn slippers?
- Stupid, Hey?
Am talking about Mrs.
Gandhi's death.
MGR is in hospital, how
is he going to bear this.
Yeah it'll be tough
If a Prime Minister
herself is not safe..
Where is this country going to?
I knew you would be
leaving at this time
What you don't know is,
that I have been waiting
What do you want?
I feel shy looking into
your eyes and talking.
Sachin, Shahrukh may
drive women crazy,..
..but you drive all women crazy.
Please don't go.
If there is any beauty in this
apartment, it's because of you.
I may be younger than you..
..but I lost my heart
the moment I saw you
Your Hairstyle..
.. your eyes ..
..that smile ..
.. so many things about you!
But..
''My dear, will you hear my song?'
'Dear one, are you sad?''
What is this racket
late in the night?
I am talking to you.
Can you hear me?
What happened?
Just as an object comes
crashing down when you drop it..
..from the third to
the ground floor..
.. my age has too, from
Something's wrong with
you. Since that day..
Which day?
Since that day you saw
something and got frightened!
Why did you have to
remind me of that?!
Be quiet. The Child will wake up
Stuff him with chips if he does.
''What do I tell you? My
heart can't bear this.''
How do I bear this? I
don't get sleep too.
Who doesn't have to face this pain?
There is no one above
you in this village.
I just revealed my sorrow
through singing my song.
My dear prince, your
sorrow is the one..''
Did something massive fall down?
Viji.
Why is he wearing a blouse?!
Why are you all staring at me
like an odd exhibit. Help me
Don't worry sir. He is all right.
How do you say that?
Even as he was falling..
..he was telling me to
switch the motor off.
Does Aunty know yet?
- Don't ask!
I called them to inform.
Told his son about him.
He told me to get him some Chips!
Is he a son or a Grinder?
How did he fall?
You won't believe me..
I hope he didn't get hurt.
You too, Viji.
While falling down he
caught the cable TV wire..
..telephone cable, etc..
..and hanging on it, he
landed safely like Spider Man.
They took him to the hospital.
But Viji, this is a
very good opportunity.
To finish him off completely?
Tomorrow morning, I am
going to meet him to enquire..
..about his health
with a banquet and..
..the sacred
vermillion of Goddess Kali.
I will join you too.
No, Viji.. you will
spoil the mood if you come.
I won't speak even a single word.
I will ask with my
eyes only whether..
..he is fine just like
Thillana Mohanambal.
Hey, you may play with me alone.
Don't play tricks on my life. Okay?
Viji!
Oh! Please come.. come.
Congratulations! Sorry sir,
it was a slip of the tongue.
In the morning..
..I had gone to the Thiruverkkadu..
..temple to do a Kumbabhishekam
..
I mean, we performed
a floral offering..
..on sir's name to the goddess.
As soon as sir recovers..
..I have prayed to shave off
the head and lift a kavadi.
Hey, shaving off the head
is not for me. But, for sir.
Won't sir lift a kavadi and all?
This is very much required
for the work he has done.
I am not able to face people.
Aunty, poor man.- Then what? Will a
nyone fear of a dead cockroach?
That didn't die.
- Oh! Is it alive?
Where have they admitted it?
Sir, hope you didn't get much hurt.
Any way, it would be
better to exercise..
Hey, keep quiet. Sir, I
need to ask you a small doubt.
What is it?
Sir, did you fall down while hitt
ing the cockroach or..
.. after hitting the cockroach?
Are these details
required now it self?
Many people have many
doubts even at our flat.
The watchman is the
only person who says..
..that you hit the cockroach.
Rest, every one is saying
that you bit the cockroach, sir.
Will you please get out?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry. Hey.
Hey, Karthik..
Still.. still, you
shouldn't have done that.
I was controlling myself a lot.
He was the one who
started about that cockroach.
Who, me? That is the reason why I
asked you not to come along.
Was it possible to control the
laughter on seeing his state?
I am sorry, Archana.
Yes. Open it and see.
A music is coming from inside.
Thank you.
Sir, excuse me.
- Thank you.
Archana.. hope you
won't misunderstand..
..if I ask you one thing.
What is music according to you?
What is music
according to you? What is it?
Okay.
- Sorry.
For all of you, music means joy.
For me, Music is another language.
I don't know Hindi.
Don't know Chinese.
In the same way, I
don't know music also.
But, a language that I know, none
of you know. Silence!
''Silence.. that silence
is the beauty in you.''
''The vision is enough. Try
to speak the words with it.''
''Silence.. that silence
is the beauty in you.''
''The vision is enough. Try
to speak the words with it.''
''In the words which are
spoken and finished..''
''..there remains a meaning.''
''..there remains
crores of meanings.''
This is my gift to you.
Bye.
On that day, the reason why
you stood turning your back..
..I could understand it now
only when I looked at your face.
When I look at you, a
thousand butterflies crave..
..without getting a
place to sit in my heart.
On seeing you, my age is
hanging on the foot board..
..just like a college student.
A kite which had forgotten to fly..
..after being
stuck on an apple tree.
I never expected that
it would fly once again.
Why are you staring like that?
Can't you understand that
I was waiting for you only?
Don't go away. I can
understand your confusion.
I might have scolded you
with love in this apartment.
You need not tell any thing.
I have the right for it.
The way I suffer
without getting proper..
..sleep after having met you..
..it is totally a new experience.
But, would this society accept us?
Are we residing at America?
They shall never
accept it, sir. Never.
When did you come?
What is this, sir? I thought
that you have changed your mind..
..but, you are changed
as a man it self, sir.
Don't touch me, please sir.
How shameful and
embarrassing it would be..
..if your wife learns about this?
A bachelor's virginity has
become very unsecured, sir.
When did you..?
- Don't touch me, sir. Please.
I didn't expect this from you, sir.
Hey, brother.. brother.. listen..
..I was watching the
register of the office. Hey, Viji.
Are you working at a boy's hostel?
I shall leave not only this
apartment, but this state also.
Viji.. Viji.. Viji..- I'm not of
that type, sir. Please leave me.
At least tell me when you
came before you go. Sorry.
I never thought that you
will get so much corrupted..
..on seeing my puppy
shame just for once.
Come, son. Come inside.
.Babu.. come.. come.. come.
What is it, babu? Oh! Chapels!
Is it all right, sir?
Fits me like a glove. Good, Babu.
He has never asked for anything
to anyone like this ever before.
He asked me very rightfully.
If I say truly, I am very
happy that he asked me like this.
I did it just as I would
for my father. That's all.
I take your leave, mother.
So that's the end of the film?
That's the hero introduction.
How do you make music for this?
That's our fate!
Please sit down. Hasn't Aunty come?
We know him well. We're his
favourites. Especially Viji
Okay, fine. Archana..
- Will you eat something? - No
Cool drinks.
- no. Pepsi - No.
Coke?
- No. Sir, at least, tea?
Coffee? - No. Atleast, Bonda? -
No. - Sir, cake? - No. - Chips?
No.
- You can take it for Arjun, sir.
I said 'no thanks'!
I have to speak to Archana.
Will you keep quiet?
Okay, okay.
- Sir, popcorn is very nice..
Archana, what are you doing here?
We came shopping.
Shopping? Why with these fellows?
She says we are all friends.
Do you need friends like them?
Go shopping with Sheela or grandma.
Why with these fellows?
She says she knows what
kind of friends to choose.
You don't have to say anything.
I should not say anything?
I am your guardian, mind it.
She says, stop
behaving like a Nutcase..
.. and to mind your own business.
Who are you calling a nutcase?
You. There is no doubt about that
Okay, I'll see.
You don't know about them.
Wait till I..
Why are you saying sorry?
He is like this.
He told us to vacate, I
told him I won't. That's why
Karthik is not married yet.
They don't rent out the space
to bachelors in your apartments
I said the same thing.
He refuses to get married.
She's asking you to
find a girl for him
I can..
But he has an image
of a girl in his mind.
Tell her straight
She should be well read.
She should be brave.
Independent thinking.
If she was all that
I just described..
..she'll be beautiful to me
What
What is she saying?
She is asking if that
girl should know music
Not necessary
If I find the girl I want,
the life I lead with
her will be happy.
That happiness will
give me good music.
She only needs to be an
inspiration for my music.
If she understands me, she
will understand my music as well.
You might as well
have told her straight
Hey, Archana..
Come in
Sit down.
Cake.
You made it?
It's like Music.
What is music like?
Like this cake!
Come here
Place you palms on these speakers.
Your palms, on these speakers.
Now there will be music.
I composed it.
Watch my hands carefully.
Okay? 1.. 2.. 3.
Yes!
That's it, Archana.
I know it Archana. I
know you can feel music.
The Music in the air, you could
see right? Understand it right?
The same way, you
will understand my mind.
I want to marry you
Will you marry me?
Tell me Archana
Archana.
Yes, I am your friend.
Even after we are married, I
will be a good friend to you.
Why can't you?
Your world is different..
Don't say that Archana!
Take me into your world.
We'll live happily. Trust me..
What else did she say?
'I can't marry anyone.
My world is different.
Nobody else can belong there',
is what she said.
She said that she
could not hear my music..
.. and she would not either.
This is what I said
Why do you need this?
No. She asked me
what music was like.
She really understood my music.
Even when I
stopped moving my hands..
..she still followed the music.
So I felt like
telling her and I did.
Am not saying it was wrong..
..but she seems to hate marriage.
She fears it. Even I
can't understand why.
Merely speaking about it angers her.
Archana is a nice girl.
But anger isn't good for a home.
Listen..
.. let this be..
..there is so much
more to do in life!
What Viji says is right.
Forgiving you last time
was itself a big thing.
I don't think it'll happen again.
I can't leave it like that
You'll apologize again?
Why should I? What did I do wrong?
Listen!
- I can't!
Sorry!
Its ok. Please be here
What did I do wrong?
I said I wanted to marry you.
Why are you so angry about that?
No, talk to me
Say something, Archana
I don't understand
I've already told you everything.
I will tell you again..
.. I don't want to see you.
Get out of my life!
Have you gone mad?
You are going overboard.
Is it wrong to propose to you?
So what if he asks you?
Is this a reason?
Karthik doesn't
expect you to know music.
Why won't you get married?
Give me reason
Karthik doesn't
think of you as a burden.
He has so much affection for you.
He won't change
Just because your father changed
doesn't mean everyone else will.
Ok I don't understand.
So please explain.
Is this how you want to be
for the rest of your life?
Why?
Why are you saying that?
Why do you think the child
you've will also be like you?
But that was two generations back..
..that doesn't mean..
If it does happen..
What Archana?
What help?
Tell Karthik?
What?
Karthik can like anybody and
marry anybody if he wants.
But I have neither the
intention nor the need for it.
He doesn't have to see me,
or wait for me either.
Tell him to marry
someone else and be happy.
I have never seen her
cry in all these years.
This was the first time
I saw tears in her eyes
Okay, Sheela. If that's what
she wants, I have to respect it
That doesn't mean I'll
forget her and marry someone else.
I just won't disturb her.
I won't come in her way.
''Oh silent one The
portrait with talking eyes''
''The child woman My darling chaos''
''I plucked the heart like a flower''
''And used my nerves to make a bower''
''I handed them
over to you, dear one''
And, you stamped over it, girl.
''Oh silent one The
portrait with talking eyes''
The rainbow started crying as
soon as it finished filling..
..the seven colors in it.
Will you be able to see it again?
In the mind of the girl,
your life ended up in confusion.
The sky is shocked
in half dizziness.
I cried calling for my love.
You are shaken up
thinking that life is revenge.
I had plucked the
flowers for your worship.
You are frightened it
is killing the flowers.
I loved you with my words. You
killed me with your illusions.
I just asked for the rain, you
gave me thunders and lightening.
''Oh silent one The
portrait with talking eyes''
''The fire is also a beauty in
the forest of bamboo shoots.''
But, I never enjoyed them.
My heart just can't bear this.
In your anger, you are a beauty.
But, I can't enjoy it. Dear one,
my heart can't tolerate this.
''Seeing your state, my heart
is beating outside my body.''
''As your heart has
torn into two pieces..
..my heart has torn
into four pieces.''
''If the seed is broken,
a plant is grown.. ''
''If the heart is broken,
grass only will grow.''
''What is a punishment in
comparison to your silence?''
Shall we eat something?
- I am not hungry
Then you eat, I just
want some Coffee..
HI.
- HI. Viji..
I'll be upstairs
He's like that only. Okay, carry on.
Bye.
- Bye.
What is this? You just left abruptly
What else should I have done?
You could have said Hello
Why? Didn't she clearly state..
..that I should not
see her or talk to her
Look here. She may have just
said that in anger.. - No.
Remember the happiness in her eyes..
when she saw that
locket at the restaurant.
I gave it to her without her asking.
Today she has asked for this.
Its better I give this to her
What? What did you want to tell me?
Am feeling shy..
What is it?
Its nothing. You
shouldn't laugh at me..
Ok, tell me
The bulb glowed for me as
well.. even the bell rang.
See you're laughing
Ok. Who is it?
Sheela.
Sheela?
When did this happen?
Yesterday, in the shopping mall
..I thought about it
at first, then I decided
Decided what?
To marry her
I am so happy. You
have such large heart
Nothing of that sort.
I am not giving her a life..
..just sharing mine
with her, like you said
Ok let's get to work. We
should first tell Sheela this
I know you feel awkward about it.
Don't worry -I will speak to her
Hey Viji, You think I
won't do this for you?
Not that. I already spoke to her.
When?
This morning at the church
Hold on! License check
It's you!
Coming from the church?
Wow what gave it away?
You have started talking like me
It's infectious. How
come you are here?
Just that I had no
recordings today. Felt bored.
So I thought I will meet
you and ask you to marry me!
Why are you so shocked?
Ok let me get right to the
point. I wish to marry you.
You know about me. I play
the keyboard, earn well.
Have already gotten
my sister married.
So it's only me and
my mom. I am free.
Other than that I've an
occasional beer on Beethoven..
..or Michael Jackson's
birthday? Any problem?
So suddenly. You
know about me, right?..
I know. What about it?
I am not concerned about your past.
It could happen to anyone.
Even I could not walk for
around a year and a half!
People had to carry me around.
Yes. But I was a baby then
Okay, jokes apart.
I've told you what I needed
to say, now it's your turn.
Is this how you really spoke?
- Yes.
So what did she say?
First she was scared,
stared around a bit,..
..then asked me to
speak to her parents
Great. But please don't
speak to her parents like this.
I already spoke to them too.
When did this happen?
I went straight to her house
- What did they say?
What is this? Is this is a
general family reaction?
It's totally unexpected.
We don't know what to say
Don't misunderstand my asking.
Do you've issues
with her marrying again?
Nothing of that sort.
I pray everyday that
something like this should happen.
Do let me know.
I won't press you to
tell me tomorrow..
..you can even tell me today
Are you married already or ..
Not yet!
They asked me if they
can have a church wedding.
People get married in
all sorts of places..
.. a church is
perfectly fine for me!
I'll tell you something beautiful..
..I told my mother yesterday.
I was wondering how she would react.
Do you know what she did
She looked at me for a bit and
then kissed me on my forehead.
She used to kiss me on my
forehead before going to school.
After all those years,
only now.. I got goose bumps.
Having lost her
husband early in her life..
..she could understand Sheela well.
It was so touching.
So when is the wedding?
Lets see.
What?
So we can fix it anytime,..
..but I asked it to be
put off by a bit. - Why?
Let things sort themselves out
with you, when can have it then
I know what you're talking about
That's a closed chapter.
It's my problem.
Life doesn't end here.
Moreover if you get married now..
..it'll be a
welcome diversion for me.
Do that for me at least
No, Karthik.
Hey, Viji.. please.
Okay.
What did she say?
She is talking about the
way you proposed to me
Even I am shocked.
Got to know the
result within the day's..
..play like in a One Day match
People all around have
been waiting for years,..
..having changed names,
identities, cities..
..and even languages just for this!
Did I say so something wrong?
Yeah she is a great girl.
But ask for her license,
and she gets angry.
Me? Thank you. But Archana,
Karthik is much nicer than me.
When your friend finds herself
a life, aren't you so joyous;..
..in the same way,
won't I be ..joyous..
..if the same
happened with my friend
We would all be overjoyed
Tried a serious role for a change
- not working at all!
I don't understand
What don't you understand?
Archana and Karthik
are getting married
No that's what we want. We
will make sure it comes true
Yes
But they've fought and are
not talking to each other?!
Yes!
Are you drunk?
What do you mean?
If Archana has to get married,
won't I find her a boy?
Who? You?
The last time you found a boy,..
..even his own
mother didn't like him.
If Archana had seen him,
she would've chased him away.
So, you'll get her
married to Karthik?
Why, what's wrong with that?
Do you know he is a drunkard?
Who is a drunkard?
Maybe one day he may have..
You keep quiet.
You also drank.
At Jayaram's wedding,
you were drunk..
..and lying sprawled in the kitchen!
When did this happen?
Didn't you know?!
You are talking unnecessarily.
Didn't you find any other place?
In the kitchen!!
Okay, control your self Janu.
Now what do you both want?
Look here..
I'm not asking you to
conduct this wedding
I believe it'll happen for sure.
But when it does, and I
see you interfering,..
..I'll end your life
with my bare hands.
Go give this locket to that aunty.?
Okay, Uncle.
That uncle told me to give it to you
Don't want!
Your Mother.. Where? Your Father?
School?
Babu can you come to
the hospital with me
What happened sir?
My son has met with accident.
I just got a call.
He always wears a helmet. He
seems to have forgotten today.
The Corporation lorry
crashed straight into him it seems.
My wife doesn't know yet.
She wont be able to bear it.
Was preparing for
the IIT entrance exam.
Even now he had gone to a
Friend's house to pick up notes.
I even told him, not
to go out so late..
..to wait till the morning.
He had said that the exam
was very important to him,..
..and he wanted to get
good marks and a good rank.
Very ambitious boy.
They say it's a head injury.
Body seems unhurt.
Can you come with me to
the hospital, Babu? Please.
Your son met with an accident
and died on the Spot damn it!
He died in the year 1984,
it's been 20 years since!
We are in 2007 now. MGR is dead,
Indira Gandhi is
dead and so is your son!
You Bloody Fool! Are
you not educated?!
Your Azharuddin,
Computers are all ancient now.
Look there.
Your wife! Do you
know why she is crying?
She's not crying for your dead son.
She's crying for you, damn it..
.. she doesn't even know if
her husband's normal or insane.
Your babu is dead!
Damn it. He is dead.
If you want, take me as your son.
Cry. Cry your heart out!
Cry, man.. cry. Cry.. cry.. cry.
I am sorry.
Why sir?
For all that happened!
Some things take
some time to understand.
I have understood only now!
Archana will also understand.
She will.
Just felt like telling you
Hello there. One minute
Congratulations!
- Thank you, sir.
After marriage he
wants to move in here.
Oh! Excellent. You are most welcome.
Will you call me for the wedding?
The first invite will be yours
Okay.. okay.
Hey come..
How come suddenly?
What are you looking at?
What is this?
What is all this?
A gift?
Why are you giving it now?
Come to the wedding
and give it yourself
Hey? What's happened to you?
You wont come for the wedding? Why?
Of course everybody will be there
Is this because
Karthik will be there?
What are you talking about?
What can Karthik do to you?
There is nothing
between you guys, right?
Why can't you see him?
What do you mean Understand?
You may have a hundred problems,..
..that doesn't mean you
don't come for my wedding.
Here. Keep this.
If you want to give it to
me. Give it at the wedding
Listen. If you don't
come for my wedding,..
..I don't want to
see you ever again.
What do you mean by just
walking out? Is that all?
Are you coming for
the wedding or not?
If this remains with me,
it won't be a violin..
..it'll just be a piece of soap.
Apparently you said you won't
come for Sheela's wedding. Why?
Why?
Just because I will be there?
Have I disturbed you
even once since that day?
I stayed away thinking, even
seeing me could cause you pain.
You have made me seem
like a cheap Roadside Rogue.
You not coming to the
wedding because of me is a LIE.
You are afraid of yourself.
But you pretend you're not.
That's the biggest problem.
All are affectionate with you.
It's you who doesn't understand.
Many people hate life
and kill themselves.
You're the only one who has
killed Life and continues living.
How are you able to pretend
being dumb to your own self? Sorry..
I am telling you for the last time.
You won't face any
problems because of me.
If you trust yourself, then come..!
If in spite of this you
don't turn up ..then..
I can see the desire to Live
in your eyes. Why deny yourself?
Why won't you give Life a chance?
Trust me, you won't lose.
What is your fear, Archana?
That you will have a child
and it'll turn out like you.
Is that all?
If such a thing happens I will
not run away like your father did.
I will bring my child
up like my own life.
Some things in life you have
to trust, without questioning.
Someday you will
realize you were wrong,..
..but it may be too
late to set it right!
I loved your silence as
much as I loved my music.
But it's you..
- ..it's you who made me cry!
My dear Bride and Groom
