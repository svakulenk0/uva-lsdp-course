- Yoo-hoo!
- You're very kind.
-
-
Ariel! Oh!
-
-
-
- Oh!
# And wave goodbye #
Good night, girls.
#... endless sky #
Our song.
Our song.
- Shh.
-
-
-
-
-
Go!
Athena!
No!
- Uppy-uppy, my darlings.
- It's us.
Governess!
- Hey!
- Rise and shine.
- Why so early?
- Mustn't be late.
But it's still dark out.
Uh...
- Oh. Hi.
- Wakey-wakey.
- Oh, I was dreaming about a boy.
- Yes. Come on, girls.
- But I need my beauty sleep.
- Tell me about it.
Easy for you.
No one cares what you look...
- Move it.
- I think you're lovely.
Can't we meet Father later?
I don't get to make
those kinds of decisions.
Any decisions, really.
- Get up!
-
- OK, we heard you.
- We're going as fast as we can.
All right, all right, all right.
Move your tails.
This is our special time
with your father.
Special?
It's the same every morning.
- She's got a point.
- That's what your father cares about.
Predictability,
presentation, punctuality.
- That's all Dad cares about.
- She's got a point.
- You've got your own mirror!
- Two minutes.
Stop primping!
- Anyway, I told her, she used to...
- Come on, Ariel.
Why can't he let us do
something different? Just once.
Give him a break.
He's the king, remember?
- You try running a kingdom.
- I wouldn't run it like this.
Don't upset him, Ariel.
Just because you're the oldest, Attina,
- doesn't mean you can boss us around.
- Yes, it does.
Benjamin, if we're late again,
I'll never get a promotion.
- Marina...
-  Come on, girls.
Not that I want a promotion.
No, no, no, I love this job.
Looking after you is what I live for.
Really.
- I hate this job!
- The less said the better.
-
-
Whoa! Whoa!
- Good morning, Your Highness.
-  Sebastian.
- Oh!
- Anything to report?
Unfortunately,
the sprat and the... smelt
were still...  squabbling.
No worries. I told them
I'd sic the salmon on them.
Sebastian,
what would I do without you?
You'd be negotiatin' with the sprat
and the smelt, that's what.
Shh!
- Good morning, girls.
-  Good morning, Father.
- Marina.
- Good morning, Your Majesty.
- Sebastian.
- You're late.
I... uh...
-
-  Your Majesty.
Well, I presume
you've all been attending
- to your royal duties this week.
- Yes, Father.
- We've been working diligently.
- We're always done early.
- Shh!
- And the coral is in bloom.
- Clam it!
- Enough!
So I thought maybe we could
go for a swim on the reef?
- Not today, Ariel.
- But it only happens once a year.
- It could be fun.
- I don't have the time.
I was thinking we could just
skip the morning walk.
Ariel! Your father said no.
Yes, sir.
Nice job.
- Be on time tomorrow.
-
- Let's move it!
- OK, we're coming.
- Time to go.
- Great.
Here they come!
Well, hi to you, too. Oh, get...
-
-
-
-  That's it!
-
- Ooh!
- Aah!
-
Your Majesty, I was thinking about
making some changes in the palace staff.
- Huh?
-  Really?
Got it!
- Watch it!
- Careful!
Get up!
Cuckoo!
That will be all, Sebastian, Marina.
- Good day, girls.
-  Goodbye, Father.
- Thank goodness that's over.
- Ariel.
Oh! Yes, Daddy?
- He sounds grumpier than yesterday.
- Time to go.
A princess does not tickle
another princess with seaweed.
You saw that?
I was just trying to have some fun.
- You disrupted your sisters.
- Well, they laughed.
- Well, I didn't.
- Daddy, why can't...
Is it too much to ask that you
simply walk with your family?
- That's all we ever do.
- Ariel...
- Can't we do something different?
- Enough!
You have to learn to respect
the way I run this kingdom.
Barnacles.
What? That'll take all day.
Well, then you'd better get started,
young lady.
I hate this place.
Mm-hmm.
Snacky-snack.
OK.
- No manners.
-  This job is killing me!
Oh, dear.
If I have to watch over these
spoiled princesses one more day,
- I'm gonna beach myself!
- Mm-hmm.
You should've heard that little
clawboy Sebastian today. "You're late."
If Triton wasn't looking,
I would have squashed
that crustacean into a crab cake!
- Mm-hmm.
-
- Maybe I'm just too sensitive?
- Dip.
- Did you feed them today?
- Yes. Twice.
And the key?
Ooh! That Sebastian!
- I despise him! I loathe him!
- Never heard that one.
How did that little invertebrate
get to be chief of staff?
- Chutzpah?
- I want that job.
I deserve that job!
So what if I'm late every once in
a while and the girls are miserable?
- Nobody's perfect.
- That's right. Nobody's... perfect.
- Nobody's perfect.
- That's right. Nobody's... perfect.
- Oh... my.
- Everyone makes mistakes,
even... him!
Or a good cuticle cream.
- Ow!
- Oh, so sorry!
Now, color? Sardine Silver?
- No, thanks.
- Orange roughy?
- Not in the mood.
- Rainbow trout?
Just paint them the shade
of clarified butter!
So much for my samples.
Uno error.
-
-  Oh, my.
-
- That's right. Three names.
-
- Ooh, French!
-
- Big surprise.
I'm feelin' it. Big wave!
-
- Mmm...
-
- Pouty. Sassy.
- Oo-wah oo-wah
-
- Oo-wah oo-wah
-
- Mmm...
- # And after that, who knows? #
Sebastian's bound
to make a mistake, right?
Not likely.
Dream killer!
One.
Live from The Catfish Club, it's...
-
- Flounder!
We love you, Flounder.
-
- Whoo! Oh, yeah!
I'm hot. I know it.
- Hey!
- Aah!
Was that... what I think it was?
- Nope. Whoops.
-
- That!
- What?
- That sound!
- Oh, that sound.
I was just...
...cleaning out these...
But then you... Hey!
And then I...
And then the thingamajiggers just
boppity boop, bop, bap!
Can you do it again?
Halt! You're in violation
of the Triton Acts!
- All music is forbidden in the kingdom!
- Not good.
- Swim!
- Hey, get back here!
Faster!
Corkscrew!
Ooh!
Torpedo tube!
Whoo-hoo!
Not again!
There they are!
Fish launch!
- Thanks.
- No problem.
-
- This way!
- My name is Flounder.
- Oh, I'm Ariel.
Oh, no!
Princess Ariel!
What is the meaning of this?!
- Princess?
- Um...
- We weren't doing anything.
-  No?
Then why were you trying to get away?
Um... 'Cause they were chasing us?
- We heard music, chief.
-
Music!
The princess was making music?
The princess wasn't making music.
He was.
Music is against the law!
Take him to the dungeon!
- I can't make it in the slammer!
- Now!
Wait! This is all
a big misunderstanding. Huge.
You are gonna laugh when I explain.
- Which I'm about to do.
- In this century, please.
Right. You see, I was just
cleaning the coral tubes,
and my friend here
was helping me.
That's right. Best friend helpin' out.
- Makin' it happen.
- But not making music.
See?
Guards! Escort the princess
back to the palace.
- But Sebastian...
- And you!
Consider this your first
and only warning, mon.
- Humph!
-
Oh!
Intolerable, I tell you.
That girl is working on my last claw!
If I change my hair,
he'd notice?
Where's my brush?
My brush works better.
OK, bedtime. Outta my way. Don't look
now, but dinner exploded on your face.
- It's plankton extract and sea salt.
- Pretty.
It rejuvenates the skin
and it won't clog your pores.
- Whatever!
- It's your face.
'Scuse me.
- Uh, is that my mask?
- Nope.
It's got my initial on it.
All of our names
start with "A," Aquata.
- My brush?
- I was gonna talk to you...
- My lucky seashells?
- They're not very lucky.
-  Mr. Fuzzyfinkle!
- He's so cute. He likes me.
- And my pillow?
- Yeah, that's for Mr. Fuzzyfinkle.
- Nice try.
- Give it back!
Arista, you always do this!
It's my stuff!
- Finally, some entertainment.
- You're just the selfishest person...
Shh! Shh! He's coming!
- Good evening, girls.
-  Father.
- Sleep well.
- Good night, Father.
Ariel?
Good night.
Good night.
Why did you do that?
He's our father.
Sit there as long as you want, Ariel.
Nothing's going to change.
Maybe I could have her pillow.
Oh! Ha, ha, very funny.
What?
How long
has she been in charge?
Right.
Flippity-flop and slide to the side.
-  The joint is jumping.
- It's time to glide.
Hey! But I got the kelp yesterday.
It's not fair.
I'm weak. Pathetic.
- I'm a lowly errand boy.
-
Oh, it's about that time.
-  Oh, yeah.
-  Hey, hey!
All right, let's bring it.
You know what to do.
- Ah!
- Ooh!
Sea kelp. Salty or extra salty.
Get your sea k...
Flounder!
- Ariel?
-
Oh, no.
Oh, Flounder.
- Sebastian!
- Whoo!
Sebastian?
-
- Sebastian.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
-
-
Ariel! No, don't!
Rock your body, child!
- Aah!
- Love your club.
-
- Huh?
Oh, wait! I won't tell.
Wait a minute. I won't tell!
Oh!
-
-
-
-
-
-
# And I
-
- This can't happen!
- # Love #
- Your father is the king!
Swifty.
Do you promise to jump, jive, wail,
groove, rock steady,
and lend a helping hand
to your fellow music lovers?
- I do.
- She's in.
Good morning, Your Highness.
Sebastian. Marina.
-
- Good morning, Your Majesty.
I have a problem.
- It's Ariel.
- Ariel? I...
Finally! So you see it, too? Oh, yes.
She's rebellious, insubordinate,
headstrong.
We need to immediately implement
a series of checks and balances
designed to crush her spirit.
What? Too harsh?
Absolutely! Your Highness,
she is young, going through a phase.
I don't remember having this much
trouble with any of her sisters.
I do! They're all a handful.
We should shave their heads.
-
- Just kidding.
- Alana wasn't difficult at all.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
But Arista and the blowfish incident,
remember?
Oh! It took weeks
to clean up the palace.
And how about Aquata
and that stingray?
- I can still feel it.
- Well...
Or the time Attina got her head
stuck in the conch shell.
That was me.
Well, perhaps you're right, Sebastian.
Still, it seems Marina
could use some help.
I want you to look after Ariel.
No offense, Marina.
None taken.
- Soft shell. Stick eye.
- Tardy girl. Fish lips.
- Backstabber. Bottom feeder!
- Fashion disaster. Babysitter!
Dismissed.
What?
What?
- Uh... You were humming.
-  I was?
- Out loud.
- Don't worry.
- It was just a dream.
- I'll tell you what wasn't a dream.
- We woke up at midnight.
- And your bed was still empty.
- Really?
- Yeah. That is two hours past curfew.
- Oh.
- Ooh, was it a boy?
- If it's a boy, I'm gonna die.
- Ugh... Drama.
I mean, I'm happy for you, Ariel.
It's just that I'm two years
older than you,
and the only one I've come
even close to kissing is Stevie.
- Ew! Squid-Lips Stevie?
- It was on a dare.
- Whatever.
- Girls, let's stick to the subject.
Well, it wasn't a boy, OK?
I was just helping a friend.
Out past the kelp forest.
Ooh! Past the kelp forest.
It wasn't a boy.
- It was a bad boy.
-
- Oh, Ariel.
- Simmer down there, sister.
- So you were just helping a friend?
- Um... Yep.
Then, where'd you get... this!
Can you imagine
what'd happen if Dad found it?
- He's never here.
- Don't get cute with me.
This is serious. Where were you?
I was just... listening to music
in an underground club.
OK, where were you really?
-  Listening to music?
- No way.
- What was it like?
- Come on. Spill it.
Oh, it was amazing.
The energy, the dancing, the music...
Just makes you feel like...
Like what?
Like when Mom was here.
Ariel, I wanna hear it, too.
- You do?
- Me, too.
- OK. Me, too.
- Me, too! Me, too!
- Not without me.
- Yeah. Everybody does.
Please, Ariel. Please?
- Well...
- Oh!
- We'll go tonight.
- I'm so excited!
- Music!
- What should I wear?
So you think there'll be boys?
- One way to find out.
- This is not happening!
You go again and I...
- Oh, lighten up.
- Come on.
Mmm?
- OK.
-
Come on, girls. Uppy-up.
- Morning.
- They're early.
Yes. But why?
Get your sea kelp. Salty or extra salty.
Hey, Ray-Ray. You gonna
rock the house tonight?
Well, wouldn't be here
just for the halibut.
- Oh, Ray-Ray.
- This is so exciting!
Hey, you're in my personal space.
- Stop pushing me.
- OK, bossy. Whatever.
-  Music!
- I know! Isn't it fantastic?
- And we're here together!
- Yeah!
Boys, here I come!
Wow. This really is... fantastic.
- Yeah. I'm scared!
- Me, too.
- I thought I was the only one.
- No, no, no, no...
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Catfish Club is proud to present...
Let's just go!
...the original rock lobster.
The one, the only, red tornado!
-
-  Sebastian?
- Way to go, Sebastian!
- I love you, Sebastian.
- Hi!
- Whoo!
OK. Where are the boys?
Are you a boy? Good enough.
Whoa! I'm Adella.
This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me!
- Would you like to dance?
- No, thanks.
- Let's dance.
- No, thanks.
Would ya like to dance?
I can't dance, OK?
I'm a mermaid with no grace.
I look like a spastic piece of kelp.
Let's go.
Seriously. No, I mean it.
You guys, I can't...
Come on.
- That's it!
- You've got it!
She really can't dance.
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah!
There ain't no problem with that.
Ah-cha, cha, cha.
Thank you.
You were right, Ariel.
Mom would've loved this.
- Yeah.
-  Thanks!
- You're the best.
- Really.
-
- Ha!
- Huh?
- Whoo!
Ha!
We be jammin', mon.
That's right!
- Good night, Ariel.
- Good night, Andrina.
Zap-it-y-do-dah, zow!
-  Night, Arista.
- Sweet dreams, Ariel.
- You, too, Alana.
- Good night, Adella.
I still didn't get to kiss a boy.
- Good night, Aquata.
- Night.
Good night, Attina.
Your Highness.
We need to talk.
-
-
Jumpin' jellyfish!
-
- Quick! This way!
-
- Hi.
This is how you watch over
my daughter?
- Sire, I...
- I trusted you.
Sire.
Guards! Lock him away.
- What? No!
- Lock them all away!
- But, Your Majesty, please!
- Come on. Let's move it.
- I'm with the band.
- Sure you are, kid.
Marina, you will take over
Sebastian's duties immediately.
As you wish.
- Attina, take your sisters home.
- Yes, sir.
- Father, you can't do this!
- It's already done!
Aah!
- You are all confined to the palace.
- Yes, Father.
Why don't you just lock us in jail?
Ariel, you are confined to the palace
until you understand what you've done.
What did we do? Tell me, Daddy...
- Ariel, leave it alone.
- No.
We haven't done anything wrong.
All we did was listen to music.
- Which you know is forbidden!
- But why? Why can't we have music?
- This discussion is over.
- Just tell me!
I do not have to explain myself to you.
I don't understand. We love music.
I will not have music in my kingdom!
I may not remember much
about my mother,
but I know she wouldn't have
wanted this.
Attina?
You just don't know when to quit.
What?
It's over, Ariel.
But... we were finally happy.
Look around, Ariel.
No one's happy.
Yahoo!
- Who is that?
- I don't know, but she scares me.
Whee!
Uh! Don't touch me.
Benjamin, tear out those puny windows.
- Rip down those narrow walls.
- Oh, no.
This is just the beginning.
I want a balcony
so I can wave down
to the adoring crowds.
But high enough so they
can't see disdain on my face.
Can you taste it, Benjamin?
The sweet taste of power!
Filling, yet oddly minty!
Delivery for Miss Del Rey.
-
- She does seem happier. Oh!
- How long has she been in charge?
- We're going on... seven minutes.
# I remember #
I got to get out of here.
I got to get out.
The walls, they're closing in.
There's no space! No air!
I got it! We'll start a riot!
Follow my lead.
Atlantica! Atlantica!
Join me, guys. Atlantica!
-  Hey, Ink Spot.
- Yeah?
-
-
This ain't living.
You know what I'm saying?
And the acoustics are non-good-ular.
Listen.
Come on, at least we're hanging out.
Can I get a "hoo-yah?"
Come on, guys. This looks
a lot worse than it is.
I'll just get an audience
with the king and I'll fix it.
Now, no offense, man,
but you had ten years to fix it,
- and this is where we end up?
- In jail.
-
- Well, I...
The band has talked it up, see,
and we want you to...
- Slip through the bars.
- Use your claws to pick the lock, man.
- And open that door!
- Good plan. Good plan.
- Solid.
- Liquid!
- Just kidding.
- No, bad plan!
If we break out of this jail, there
ain't no coming back here, mon!
We'll be fugitives!
- That's cool.
- That works.
What's a fugitive?
What about Ariel?
You just going to abandon her?
Leave her to deal with all
that we tangled her up in?
You think that small, weak,
innocent, helpless little girl
- can do anything by herself? Oh!
-
- Ariel?
- Come on, Sebastian. Let's go.
- I'm with her.
- If we run away from Atlantica,
- it will break your father's heart.
- She got to do what she got to do.
- I'm sorry. I just can't live here.
- Yeah, let's go.
Listen, I will not be responsible
for taking you away from your family.
I'm leaving! With or without you.
- All right!
- Nobody's leaving!
- Except you.
- Mmm-hmm.
Look, Sebastian, without music,
this place just isn't home.
- You know she ain't lying.
- Ain't no comeback to that!
You got that right.
Ha! Oh, no, no, no.
Never mind.
- Are you OK?
- Ariel, you're right!
Without music,
this place just isn't home.
I know just where to go!
Freedom!
Oh...
-
- Aw...
-
-
OK...
Oh!
Oh, dear.
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!
Flounder, shh!
Move it, move it, move it, mon.
-  Move it, move it, move it.
- Flounder, please!
-
- Shh!
This way. Come on.
- Flounder, shh! Be quiet.
- Ditto!
- Shh!
-
Yeah! Hit me!
Hey, small fry, I think you could
use some lessons in fugitivity.
Oh, yeah. Right. Got it.
You're gonna blow it for all of us.
- Blow, good.
-
Hey, kid, ixnay on the soundtrack.
- Why?
- Why? Why? Why? Try jail!
- Prison!
- The big house!
- The slammer!
- Music is against the law, you dig?
Not out here.
- What?
- Come on.
We ran away so we could sing.
And I'm singing.
You know, the kid's
striking a major chord.
I feel it, I feel it.
Look at him go with his bad little self.
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on. Let it happen.
-
- There he goes again.
-
- He's groovin'!
- Let me try it now.
-
-
-
Whoo!
-
- I dig this freedom!
Try and stop me!
Oh, yeah, take me with you.
-  Come on, guys. This way.
-  All right.
-  OK.
-  Let's step-a-doodle.
-  Where are we going exactly?
-  Don't worry, mon.
'Cause I got to go
to the bathroom.
Oh, Flounder.
And thanks to my
bold new initiatives,
second only to my fabulous day wear
and dressy evening separates,
productivity in all sectors
is up 20 percent.
Squids are producing more ink,
kelp more oxygen,
and the coral reef is just churning
out the plankton. Chuga, chuga!
I do so enjoy fresh plankton
on my salad, don't you?
I'll take that as a yes.
As you can see, I'm...
I'm a self-starter, Your Majesty,
here to anticipate your every need.
Not like that last guy.
What was his name?
Sooner we forget about him,
the better.
In fact, let's make a vow
never to mention his name again.
Here, I'll start.
There. Wasn't that easy?
- Marina.
- Busy!
- I think I was too hard on them.
-  Huh?
- It's about Ariel.
- Not now!
- Perhaps I went too far.
- Nonsense, Your Highness. Not possible.
- Marina.
- What?
-  Daddy!
- Huh?
- Ariel's missing.
- What?
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I just... did.
We can't find her!
We've looked everywhere!
Don't worry. I'll find her.
Get me Sebastian!
What, what! No, no, no!
No, I'm in charge here! Well...
Sebastian's gone, too.
Guards! Search the palace.
Search every inch of Atlantica!
Find my daughter!
Your Majesty. Whoo-hoo!
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.
Sebastian.
- Are we there yet?
- No.
- Are we there yet?
- No.
- Are we there yet?
- No.
- Are we there yet?
- No.
- Are we there yet?
- Yes. This is it.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- Are you s?
- Yes!
Oh, man. We can't live here!
Yeah, this place is all "Oom-pa-pa."
We need some...
Nonsense. It's perfect.
Just listen to them acoustics:
Solid.
Well, it beats the dungeon.
But not by much.
It'll do for the time being. Excuse me.
Ooh...
-
- Sebastian, be honest. Are we lost?
No, this is fine.
There's more to this place
than meets the eye.
-  Knock it off!
-  Sorry.
-  Give me the key!
-  I said no.
Look, I haven't worked my tail off
for the last 12 hours
- just to have it snatched away.
- How about a nice relaxing bath?
- Benjamin.
- Kelp wrap? Lomi lomi rub?
Give me the key!
You said never give it to you
in a fit of rage!
- I'm perfectly calm!
- Doesn't sound it.
- Give! Give!
- Oh!
- Mm-mmm.
- Give!
- Oh, look at the pretty fishies.
- Really? Where?
- Oh!
-
Ooh, yum-yums!
Come to Mommy.
-
-
Oh, yes. Mommy wuvs you.
OK, I'm not gonna watch this part.
My, my, are you hungry? Ooh...
- Who wants crab cakes?
- What are you going to do?
Whatever it takes
to get rid of Sebastian!
- But what about Ariel?
- Ariel? Ariel?
You're right. She'll tattle.
- I'll have to get rid of her, too.
- What?
- That's brilliant, Benjamin, brilliant!
- OK, that wasn't what I meant.
I never liked her anyway.
I'll make it look like an accident.
That's it! An accidental
underwater ambush
by a team of the cutest
wittle yum-yums ever.
- You've lost your mind.
- Sic 'em, boys!
Ooh, what hath we wrought?
Oh, swim, you pretties.
Swim, you pretties. Faster! Swim.
-
- Wait up!
- Sebastian.
- Five more minutes, Mommy.
Sebastian, did you hear that?
Leave me alone. Sleeping.
But there's something out there.
Come on, help me find it.
I'm tired. You go check it out.
It was an
anniversary present.
Your father had the music box
made for your mother.
Athena was more than his queen,
you know.
She was his best friend.
When your mother died,
the whole kingdom was heartbroken.
The heart that never healed
was your father's.
It's so sad.
He's forgotten
what it feels like to be happy.
I... I have to bring this back to him.
If you insist.
This is why we came here, isn't it?
Whoa, whoa, let me get this straight.
You led us out here...
To the armpit of nowhere, man.
In the hope that Red
might find the music box.
And now you wanna go back
to the palace...
- To return the music box to the king...
- On the chance that maybe it'll...
Remind him to remember
how to be happy...
And then he'll bring music back?
That about sums it up.
Couldn't we just strap it to a dolphin?
He'd get it eventually.
Listen, the band talked it over, and...
We just can't take that chance.
- What?
- Huh?
It's OK. Maybe someday
it'll be different.
You'll come home
and play music all you want.
Sure, Red. Someday.
- Someday.
- Bye.
What? No, no, wait. Ray-Ray!
Guys! We can't just let them
go back alone.
- Drop it, small fry.
- But we took an oath!
To jump, jive, wail, groove,
rock steady, and at all times
lend a helping hand
to your fellow music lovers!
The Catfish Club is history.
That oath don't mean a thing.
Well, it still means something to me.
Hey, Ariel! Wait up! Ariel!
I don't remember this much kelp
when we came through here last night.
Oh!
Kelp, schmelp. I ain't afraid
of these overgrown weeds.
Hi-yah!
Take that! And that!
Guys? That ain't kelp!
- Surprise!
- Marina?
- What are you wearing?
- I thought I'd dress for the occasion.
What's the occasion?
-  Go, go, go, go!
- Sic 'em, boys.
-
-
Keep going!
-
-
-  Ah!
- Ow!
That... hurt.
This way. Quick!
Where's Sebastian?
-
-
I've tasted power, Sebastian.
- And I'm never letting go.
- Bring it on!
Come to daddy.
-
- Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah!
-
-
- Oh, my!
-
-
-
- Now!
- Huh?
- Fire!
-
Yeah! Awesome!
- Ooh, they hurtin' for certain.
- Yup, yup, yup.
- Sebastian's in trouble!
- Follow me!
- Let's go.
- Right in your wake, kid.
- The music box!
- Ariel!
Huh?
How do you like that?
Oops.
Flounder!
-  Come on, try and get me.
- Get back here!
-
- Ow!
Chika, boom, boom, boom! #
-
-
Tight fit?
You... stink.
- I win.
-
- Flounder!
- Sebastian! Help!
I got the tail.
- Hey! Flounder at twelve o'clock!
- 12:04, actually.
- Flounder.
- Whoa!
- Do the corkscrew!
-  Break out all the utensils.
-
- Whoa, whoa!
- Who the fish?
-  That's it.
Go, Flounder! Go, go!
You slippery eel!
Yeah, mon, just like we planned it.
Way to go, Flounder, you did it!
- We did it, mon.
- We sure did.
- Solid.
-  Come on. Let's go!
-  Sebastian!
- Look out!
Ariel! No!
-
- What have I done?
Daddy?
I'm... I'm so sorry I didn't listen.
- I'm sorry.
- Daddy.
- Let's go home.
-
- Guys, you came back.
- Sure did, small fry.
Like you said, we took an oath.
Come here, you little knucklehead.
- Group hug!
- We dig you, man.
Guys... can't breathe.
Mmm.
Rise and shine.
It's a beautiful day.
- Daddy!
- Daddy!
To my daughters,
and to all the citizens of Atlantica,
I hereby decree that music
will once again ring clear
from one end of my kingdom
to the other!
Therefore, I hereby present
Atlantica's first
official Court Composer.
-  Yeah, yeah!
-  Fabulous!
Thank you, Your Highness.
Uh, not that we don't trust you,
Your Majesty, but...
Swifty, hit it, mon.
Raise your right hand,
fin, claw, tentacle,
or whatever the case may be.
Very good. Do you promise
to jump, jive, wail, groove,
and at all times lend a helping hand
to your fellow music lovers?
- Um... I do?
-
Thank you, Ariel.
Yoo-hoo!
-
-
- A girl in the band?
- That's right.
-
-
Daddy, how about a dance?
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Whoo!  Conga!
# I will sing for the rest of my life #
Let's think about what we've learned.
You just can't hurt people.
Hurting is mean.
We don't want to be mean, do we?
Maybe you're right.
That's my girl.
Samba?
Ooh-wa,
ooh-wa!
