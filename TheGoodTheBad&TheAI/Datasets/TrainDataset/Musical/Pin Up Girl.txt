- Boy, what a ride.
- Never thought we'd make it.
Bye! Oh!
Hey, how many guys are in there anyway?
- Hey, where's the sarge?
- Don't worry. He's in there.
Thanks, lady.
Kinda cozy, wasn't it?
Sure was!
- Give us a lift, lady?
- Okay. Hop in.
You're my little pinup girl
Honestly, you are
How would you like some coffee
A doughnut
An apple
A candy bar
Won't ya be my pinup girl
Give a guy a break
The best that we can give you
- Is cocoa
- A cookie
A piece of angel cake
I have to have that smile
Before me
No matter where I roam
We have some nice
old-fashioned mince pie
Like your mama
used to bake back home
Do I love my pinup girl
With all my heart and soul
I'm sure I understand you
But I'm here to hand you
A hot dog on a roll
We surely understand you
But we're here to hand you
A wienie on a roll
Weenie-meenie-miney-mo
Who's the darlin' of the U.S.O.
Lorry, Lorry
Must be you
Tell us a story
Lorry, do
Okay, I'll tell you one that's true
A boy sent his baby a note
And this is exactly
what he wrote, quote
Honey, don't worry your head about
Those pinup girls you've read about
For you most certainly know
You're my little pinup girl
Honestly, you are
To me you have the grace of an angel
The face of a movie star
You're my little pinup girl
Though we are apart
When I'm in sleepy willow
You're pinned on my pillow
And also in my heart
I have to have that smile
Before me
No matter where I roam
That twinkle in your eyes
can warm me
Like a fireside at home
Do I love my pinup girl
Bet your life I do
So, baby, keep a-grinning
Remember, I'm pinning
My hopes on you
I have to have that smile
Before me
No matter where I roam
The twinkle in your eyes
Can warm me
Like a fireside
At home
Do you love your pinup girl
Bet your life we do
Do-doo-doo-doo
Well, baby, keep a-grinnin'
Remember
I'm pinning all my hopes
On you
- Miss Jones?
- Yes?
I'm a deputation from Company "B."
I got a protest to read to you.
"A proclamation from the men of Company 'B'
in protest to LorryJones.
"Whereas the men of Company 'B'-
of which I am one-
"have enjoyed
the Missoula U.S.O. canteen...
"and whereas such enjoyment was caused by
the charming presence of Miss LorryJones...
"therefore, be it resolved that Company 'B'
herewith lodges formal protest...
"and begs Miss Jones to call off
her trip to Washington, D. C...
and stick right here in town
where we need her, whereas!"
I think that's awfully sweet of you...
but I've already given my promise
to the U.S.O. in Washington...
that I'd go with
one of their road shows.
- Oh, no, Lorry!
- They're sending me to all their camps.
- I think they're gonna make me an honorary colonel.
- Really?
LorryJones,
how can you stand there-
They were even gonna send a military escort
to take me to the train tonight...
but I thought that was too much.
- That is too much- way too much.
- What's with her?
Well, if you gotta go, you gotta go.
But what about those pinup pictures
you promised us?
I have them all ready for you.
Come on over to the counter.
Say, do you know
where I can find LorryJones?
Yeah, but I ain't gonna tell you.
- Come on, Lorry. I was the first one here.
- Me too, Lorry!
How 'bout me, Lorry?
You promised me one!
It says the same on each of them-
"With Love, Lorry."
- Lorry!
- Hello. Here's the last one. That's all, fellas.
Come on, Lorry. We'd better hurry!
I'll have to say good-bye, unless a few of you
want to see Kay and me to the station.
- What do you mean, a few of us?
We'll all go! Huh, fellas?
But, Lorry, don't you remember?
I'm the guy you became engaged to last night.
George! Of course!
I'm supposed to take you
to the station alone!
- What do you mean, "alone"? Get a load of this guy!
- Where do you get that?
We're all going with you!
Wait a minute.
I know how I can settle it, fellas.
George will go with me, and you'll go with Kay,
but we'll be together.
- How's that?
- Swell!
- Stop pushin', will you?
- We at Company "B" are gonna miss ya.
This U.S.O. canteen
will never be the same.
I don't feel like taking my clothes off
with just that little curtain...
Don't be silly, Kay.
What are you afraid of?
Why are you so brave?
You've never been in a Pullman before.
Oh, yes, I have, when I visited
my uncle in California.
You've never been out of Missouri
in your life.
Lorry, sometime someone's
gonna catch up with you good.
You'll never get away with making people back
home believe you've gone to Washington...
to join a U.S.O. show.
Oh, I don't know why you just didn't
tell them the honest truth.
And let them know we're only gonna work
as stenographers for civil service?
- Why should I?
- Because it's the truth.
Maybe it is right now, but something
could change it, couldn't it?
When you let people believe things
that aren't so, it's lying.
Like letting that marine who brought us
to the train think he's engaged to you.
You have about six other boys
thinking the same thing.
They wanna think it. Besides,
I like being nice to the boys in service.
Anyway, I'll probably never
even see them again.
You better not see them again...
at least not all at the same time.
Oh, Lorry, why do you
always have to tell fibs?
- I don't tell fibs.
- Quiet.!
I just make things up.
It's certainly no thrill pushing a typewriter
and eating drugstore lunches...
and being a fixture in an office.
Just the same, I'm thrilled
with being just what we are.
Imagine us in Washington
Sunday morning.
Imagine us in New York
Sunday morning.
Gee, won't it be-
Laura Jones!
I knew I shouldn't
have come with you!
- If you start planning anything funny-
- Why not?
- We don't have to report for work until Monday.
- But, Lorry!
Oh, I won't listen to you.
And besides, we promised my aunt
in Baltimore that we'd visit her Sunday...
and, well, if we don't show up-
- We can tell her our train was wrecked.
- There you go again.
Pardon me.
What's all the excitement about?
Tommy Dooley, one of the navy heroes
from Guadalcanal, is arriving.
Kay, our first thrill, and we're
only off the train two minutes!
- Hi, Tommy. Nice going, sailor.
- Hiya, big boy!
- Welcome to New York.
- Thanks-
Uh, I'm afraid I don't remember-
You don't?
- Mabel?
- Nope. Try again.
- Fifi.
- Nope.
Here.
Maybe I got a better memory.
Stand back, and let her keep trying.
I think I'm getting warmer.
Who's that girl, his fiancée?
No, ma'am. That's Miss Molly McKay,
a nightclub entertainer.
She sure love heroes,
and she meets them all.
If they're all like him,
it must be a wonderful hobby.
Ah, just call me Molly, and don't you
dare let me see you lookin' lonesome.
Well, grab a wing, sailor.
We're goin' places.
- Just a minute, lady. Don't you think-
- She is thinkin'.
Whatever it is, I'm for it.
Come on. Let's go.
That's our first thrill.
Let's go look for another one.
Or bring a blue tomorrow
Time alone will tell
If our romance is real
Or just a springtime spell
For heaven knows
And time will tell
- Bonsoir, mademoiselle.
- We'd like a table, please.
Uh, any little table will do.
In what name did mademoiselle call
to make the reservation?
Oh, well, we didn't think-
Yes, I'm sorry, mademoiselle.
- For this evening, all tables are taken.
- Pierre, no tables?
Bonsoir, madame.
You have reservations, of course.
He gave them a table,
and they didn't have an escort.
When he saw us coming,
he put the rope up.
We should have used our imagination.
We should have-
Lorry, don't. Don't use yours.
You do such awful things with it.
Excuse me, please.
When the gentleman
we were expecting arrives...
tell him the ladies left
because you didn't have a table.
Oui, mademoiselle.
The gentleman's name?
Mr. Tommy Dooley from Guadalcanal.
Certainement, mademoiselle.
Mr. Tommy-Tommy Dooley?
Oh, mademoiselle, there is a mistake!
Of course we have a table for Mr. Dooley.
The best, at the ringside.
We'll know it's real
But time will tell
How could you look him in the eye and tell him
we were expecting Tommy Dooley?
Well, he's important. The headwaiter knows him.
And it worked. We're in.
Ooh
Time alone
Will tell
Good evening. I'm Eddie Hall.
I hope you liked that number.
Boys played it just for you.
- Gardenias, as big as sunflowers!
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, d-did you say your name was-
- Eddie Hall.
I'm the owner of the show.
Just a little gift. We present them
to all our important guests.
- Oh, but, Mr. Hall- - That's very nice
of you, and the music was wonderful.
It reminded me so much
of the night I was in Paris.
- Prince Dubonnet had just
asked me to dance- Oh!
- Lorry, don't you think- I mean-
- Pardon me.
Molly and Mr. Dooley just arrived.
Excuse me.
- Lorry-
- Oh! Thank you.
Let's get out of here before
we get into any more trouble.
Don't be silly. He has no way of finding out
whether we know Dooley or not.
Oh, what that'll do to you
with your ideas.
Try it. Go ahead.
Tommy, you old son of a gun!
- Eddie, shake hands with a pal o' mine, Dud Miller.
- Pleased to meet you.
- You're an optimist.
- Molly, we're late with the show.
Will you get out from under that soup plate
and get into your costume?
After my number, I'll be back. Don't let Eddie
bore you. Remember, I saw you first.
Always kidding. Oh, Pierre.
I'll have you seated,
and we'll go on with the show.
- Take Mr. Dooley and his friend to their table.
- Oui, monsieur.
Thanks a million, Eddie, and hurry back.
We want you with us.
Maybe you'll change your mind when you
see what's waiting for you at the table.
What's he mean by that?
A big dinner, of course.
A swell guy like that thinks of everything.
This way, monsieur.
- It's Tommy Dooley.!
- Attaboy, Dooley.!
Oh, come on!
Let's get out of here!
There. Didn't I tell you a guy
like that thinks of everything?
- Thanks. How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Gee, I didn't expect a surprise like this.
- You and us both.
It was nice of Eddie to invite you.
I'm glad you're here.
Oh, thank you, but, well, you see-
I'll bet you two girls are actresses, huh?
- Oh, heavens, no. We're just-
- We're in musical comedy.
- Really? What show are you with?
- Uh, Remember Me.
No, I can't say that I do,
but I just got back in town-
- That's the name of their show here on Broadway.
- We'll have to see it.
Splendid!
We'll get you some tickets.
- I think we'd better be going.
- What's the idea? What did we do?
And besides, we just met.
You don't want to break my heart, do you?
I don't suppose there need be
any rush about it.
Good. At least we've got one thing settled
for the rest of the evening.
When the red red robins
and the bob bobwhites
And pretty bluebirds
sing you out of bed
They're tweet-tweetin' to tell you
In their tweet way
That there's a happier day ahead
When the red red robins
and the bob bobwhites
And pretty bluebirds
chirp their little tune
They're just tryin' to sell you
a bill of goods
But we'll be out of the woods
real soon
When they're whistlin'
on your windowsill
Join along in their familiar song
If you won't
the whippoorwill will
Oh, it's not so easy
to be gay and breezy
When the whole darn world
is in a stew
But to help the morale
won't you be a good pal
Won't you warble a chorus or two
Like the red red robins
and the bob bobwhites
And the bluebirds do
Hep, hep, you cats dig me righteously
Speakin' of birds
it's occurred to me
I know a new bird
who's no bluebird
He can rock it
Wait and see
You've just heard the "jitterbird"
Oh, it's not so easy
To be gay, gay
And breezy
When the whole darn world
Is in a stew
But to help the morale
won't you be a good pal
Won't you warble a chorus or two
Like the red red robins
and the bob bobwhites
And the bluebirds do
And pretty bluebirds
sing you out ofbed
When they're whistlin'
on your windowsill
Tra-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
If you won't
the whippoorwill will
It's not so easy
to be gay and breezy
When the whole darn world
is in a stew
But to help the morale
won't you be a good pal
But to help the morale
won't you be a good pal
Oh, don't be uneasy
Just be gay and breezy
When the whole darn world
is in a stew
Like the red red robins
and the bob bobwhites
- Wasn't it beautiful?
- Yes, and Miss McKay can certainly put over a song.
- And how!
- She's a swell gal too. She and Eddie will be over to join us.
They will?
Oh, I think that will be wonderful.
- I mean, I wonder if I can make a phone call.
- That's right. Uncle Herman.
He'll never forgive us
for not phoning him.
Hey, wait a minute.
What's the rush?
- Oh, well, we were just going to make a phone call.
- Don't go.
I'll have a phone brought to the table.
Sit down.
I've been talking to your friends,
but I don't think Molly has met them.
- Introduce us.
- Introduce you?
- Yeah.
- Aren't they friends of yours?
I guess we're all a little mixed up.
You see-
- You mean to say you didn't invite these girls here?
- Me? I invited them?
Oh, now I think I'm beginning
to get the angle.
- You figured I'd get lost in the traffic, huh?
- Wait a minute, Molly.
You know that I wouldn't do
anything like that to you for the world.
Tell her the truth. Did I invite you-
When the agent phoned and told us to come over,
well, naturally we thought that-
Agent? What agent phoned you?
How should I know? All he said
was to see you about the tryout-
Don't you realize that this is Miss Lorraine
from the musical comedy Remember Me?
You see, we came right over
from the theater...
and I guess, by mistake,
they seated us at this table.
Just a minute.
Remember Me closed last night.
What's the difference?
They're here now, and everybody's happy.
- Aren't we?
- If you were in Remember Me, you know all the numbers.
Oh, heavens to Betsy, yes.
She knows them backwards. Why, back in-
Well, that's fine. Why don't we
have her try one out right now?
I told you,
I don't know anything about it!
I think it's a swell idea, and we're all for it.
Aren't we, Miss Lorraine?
Oh, I'd love to, but we have
to catch a train in 40 minutes.
We're joining the U.S.O. show
in Washington.
- This'll only take a couple of minutes.
- I'm sorry. I can't.
- I have a cold.
- Oh, come on.
There's no need for me to deliberately
flaunt myself with laryngitis, is there?
- Come on.
- Well, it's too late to phone Uncle Herman now.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a big surprise for you.
As a matter of fact, it's a bigger
surprise to me than it'll be to you.
You all remember me?
I mean, the show Remember Me.
Then surely you'll remember her.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Miss Laura Lorraine...
in "Don't Carry Tales."
All right? Take it away, Charlie.
Listen, children
Listen to your teacher
Pay attention and learn your ABC's
And when you grow up
you can be a quiz kid
Or a guest of honor
Listen, children
Listen to your teacher
You gotta know your figures
if you wanna be considered bright
Tell us more, oh, teacher
Tell us more, more, more
Listen, children
Listen to your teacher
Battles are won in the daytime
Ah, but history is made at night
Tell us more, oh, teacher
Tell us more
- More?
- More!
If you want to be teacher's pet
Here's a little motto
that you mustn't
No, you dasn't ever forget
Don't carry tales out of school
'Cause if you do
you're a fool
You mustn't tell
everything you know
And keep it to yourself
that I love you so much
Don't carry tales out of school
You'll find it's a pip of a rule
And though a busybody
may insist
Don't let on that we've kissed
If you're a blabbermouth
you're off my list
So don't be a stubborn mule, baby
And don't carry tales out of school
Tell us more, oh, teacher
Tell us more
Well, don't you think
we ought to dance now
You'd better button up
your upper lip
A little slip may sink your ship
If you're a blabbermouth
you're off my list
So don't be a stubborn mule, baby
- Hush.
- Shush.
- Psst.
- Hey.
If as a lover
you're a riot
Don't let out a peep
Just keep it quiet
Don't carry tales out of school
Yes, sir!
Whoo-hoo!
Terrific guy-
that Malcolm on the drums.
- You were swell.
- Oh, thank you.
- May I have this dance?
- Uh-huh.
Hold it. Thank you.
I think it's swell that a big
musical-comedy star like you...
could come here on a blind date,
not knowing who you were going to meet.
Oh, one gets tired of the usual bankers...
and millionaires and playboys.
It's rather nice meeting
someone... different.
Does he have to dance
every dance with her?
Newark, New Brunswick,
Elizabethtown.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Did you think we were never coming back?
Nothing like a hamper of goodies
to take on the train.
- You look like Santy Claus.
- As far as I'm concerned, it is Christmas.
You don't know what the past few hours
have meant to me, Lorry.
- They were wonderful.
- I had a terrible disappointment when I came home.
You did? How?
Well, sounds kind of goofy, but...
while I was in Guadalcanal, a girl sent me
a fan letter with her picture in it.
Boy, did I fall-
hook, line and sinker.
I could hardly wait
till I got home to meet her.
And now you find she doesn't like you?
It was a bigger disappointment than that.
I found she was married and the picture
she'd sent had been taken 15 years ago.
Oh.
Now you know what it means to meet a girl
like you who's really on the level.
- Lorry, come on. We'll miss our train.
- Baltimore-
Ooh, that's us. I guess
we'll have to say good-bye now.
Wait a minute. We haven't got your address.
Who's got a pencil?
- I have.
- Get me paper, somebody, quick.
Here. Write it on the back
of that magazine.
We're stopping off to visit
Kay's aunt in Baltimore first...
so if you want to write, you'd better
send the letters in care of her.
- What's her address?
- 473 Oriole Street.
And my aunt's name
is Miss Minny Pritchett.
Gee, it'll be like doing time
in the brig till we hear from you.
I don't know what you mean,
but sounds awful nice.
Hold out your arms-
for the packages, I mean.
- Can you hold 'em all?
- Uh-huh.
- Both your hands full?
- I'm afraid they are.
Not good-bye, just good night.
Good night.
Come on, Lorry. Hurry up.
Oh! Good-bye! Uh, good night.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Hey. How far is Baltimore
from Washington?
Oh, uh, it's about the same as it is
from Washington to Baltimore.
What's that address?
Hey, I forgot to
tear it off the magazine!
- Hey, wait! Hold that train!
- Hold that train!
If nothing else gets me down about this job,
climbing these stairs every day will.
Come on. After two weeks, you oughta
be able to get your mind off New York.
- They've probably forgotten all about us by now.
- Men are like that.
Dud Miller's the only one who ever
treated me sweet and suggestive...
but I loved it.
Mmm, it was wonderful,
being a musical-comedy star...
for a night.
I guess it's the nicest thing you've ever been.
In your mind, I mean.
Bureau of Aeronautics.
Uh, you got me. No, I know!
You go down here-
- It's them!
- What'll we do?
Oh! Run!
- We're trapped.
- Now where will we go?
So you keep right on going
till you get to 3361.
Oh, hold on. That's the old 3354.
That ain't right.
Wait a minute. I'm wrong.
You don't turn right. You turn left.
- Oh, the left.
- That's right.
- You mean my right?
- No, my right, your left.
- If I turn left, I'm right?
- No, my right, your left.
- My left?
- That's right.
Why didn't I stay in Missoula?
Never mind that. Peek out and see
where they're going. Go on!
It's safe.
Let's get to the office quick!
- 3369. Here we are.
- Hey, wait.
- Well, then it must be back that way.
- I give up.
Wait a minute.
Oh!
- What's the matter?
- It's them again. They're coming back!
- Here we are- 3368.
- Yeah. Finally.
I'll wait outside till
you're through with the chief.
- Okay. I don't think I'll be very long anyway.
- Hey, square your hat.
- Where'd they go?
- Your hero went in next door, where you have to work today.
Oh! Well, I won't go in.
I'll quit first.
Dooley, you youngsters
are doing a grand job.
- I wish I could be out there with you.
- Wish you could too, Chief.
And I would be if I could
get back on active service.
Just think of me,
Chief Barney Briggs...
- lashed and battened down to a desk.
- Tough.
You know if-
Oh, why don't I shut my mouth?
Where's that stenographer?
That's you.
- Well, did you have a good time in New York?
- Couldn't have asked for better.
They gave me everything
but the sidewalks- dinners, shindigs.
- Reel in a lot of your dough?
- Oh, no.
Met a girl who works in a nightclub.
Everything free.
Mmm. Danced all night every night.
- Well, uh-
- You're lucky you didn't get back here on crutches.
Look at that!
Plastered all over the papers with women!
- Now, Chief-
- Women- I hate 'em!
- Hello.
- Hello, Briggsey. Is my little Kewpie stepping out tonight?
Oh, uh, yes, Admiral.
I'll, uh- I'll, uh, do that, sir.
- You take my advice and keep away from them.
- Now, look, Chief-
"Dooley, Aviation Ordinance Man Second,
distinguished service.
Transferred to Washington special duty
and further medical examination. "
So you stopped off in New York
and danced yourself dizzy.
You know you're supposed to take care
of that bad leg? Who was she?
Beautiful! Uh, I mean, uh,
she's a musical-comedy star.
Just what I thought. She used you
to get her pictures in the paper.
She ran around with you
to cash in on your publicity.
Oh, no, Chief. You've got that all wrong.
I only saw her once.
That's once too often!
See here, Dooley!
The navy doesn't want you kids
to make fools of yourselves.
All this girl of yours wants
is notoriety.
She might even follow you
here to Washington.
If she does, I'll have her locked up.!
I'll turn her over to the F.B. I...!
But don't you worry, Dooley.
I'll protect you.
That's my job- to see that you fellas
aren't exploited. You don't know women.
- No?
- No. You haven't been in the navy long enough.
But you can depend on me.
I know.
- Swell. Got any telephone numbers?
- I've got a book full of tel-
Wait a minute. What do you mean?
You're here on business.
The Bureau of Aeronautics wants
a report on everything you've learned...
aboutJaps and Jap tactics.
Here, this young lady will take down
your report in shorthand.
- What's your name, miss?
- Jones.
- Little late, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.
Here's my department record.
- Miss Jones, this is Mr. Dooley.
- How do you do?
You work with him to get his report out.
Use that office in there.
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.
- Now, get to work and keep your mind on it.
- Okay, Chief.
- Shall I take dictation, or would you rather-
- Hmm?
- I said, shall I take notes or-
- Do you dance?
- Not during office hours.
- Oh.
Well, there was something
about you that-
I mean, it reminded me of-
No. Couldn't be.
- I'm ready, Mr. Dooley.
- Look, I don't wanna work.
I want to go to Baltimore.
Where is it?
- I think it's over there behind the navy yard.
- Well, that's something.
I'll be a little closer to her
when I'm in my bunk.
Miss Jones,
have you ever been in love?
- Well, l-
- No, you look too sensible.
For days I've been
walking around in circles.
- I've even been talking to myself.
- You have?
That's the way you get.
I met a wonderful girl and lost her address.
That's why I have to go to Baltimore.
She's staying there someplace.
I've got to find her.
You know, the first time we met...
the first time we looked at each other...
it was just like- like coming in
with your wings flapping.
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Oh, she's gorgeous.
She- She takes your breath away.
She makes you feel, well-
- Were you ever tattooed?
- No, but-
Well, that's just the way
she makes you feel-
like somebody's
sticking needles in you all over.
Am I boring you?
Gosh, no. Oh, no, sir.
Ah, what's the use?
I'll never find her in Baltimore.
I'd have to go around ringing doorbells.
But perhaps if she knows
you're here in the navy department...
and anxious to see her again,
she might telephone you.
- Do you think she would?
- Well, if I were in love as much as you seem to be.
Oh, I'm off my top!
Well, I'd phone you.
Oh, Miss Jones!
You've saved my life.
You're a great girl, wonderful.
I'll never forget.
Hey, can you leave your work
for a minute?
Oh. Miss Jones, Mr. Miller.
Hiya. The O.W.I.
wants you right away.
Miss Jones thinks Miss Lorraine
might call me up from Baltimore.
- Hey, suppose she does while I'm gone?
- I'll take the message.
Swell. Don't leave the phone,
not an inch. Tell her l-
Tell her I'll be right back.
Get her number. Come on.
- Have I got my fingers crossed.
- Didn't you tumble?
- Tumble? What do you mean?
- In there- that girl.
Isn't she the one we met in New York?
The "Remember Me" girl.
What are you talkin' about? That's Miss Jones.
She typewrites with her fingers.
Oh, yeah? For two girls to look that much
alike, she'd have to do it with mirrors.
If she was the same one,
what would she be doing here as a steno?
Why would she- Oh, hiya, Chief.
I thought you were working.
What's the matter? Isn't that girl all right?
- Absolutely. I got called over to the O.W.I.
- Excuse me, Chief.
That girl in there-
How long's she been working here?
- Her report card says a week. She's from out of town.
- New York?
No, she came here on government transportation
direct from Missoula, Missouri.
Highly recommended.
Don't you two try to start anything.
Oh, no, no, no. We wouldn't-
Oh!
Extension 47.
Hello, Kay?
Everything's wonderful!
I'm gonna take Mr. Dooley's report,
and he loves me. He's been trying to find me!
- Didn't he recognize you?
- No, he doesn't know I'm me.
But he loves me
ever since he first met me.
But, Lorry, what'll you do now?
You can't let him go on thinking that-
But I have to! He's crazy about
Laura Lorraine, not Laura Jones, and-
- Good-bye.
- Who was that?
Why, Miss Lorraine.
Miss Lorraine?
Why did you let her go? Why did you-
I told her you were out of the office.
But I wasn't. I was right there.
She said she was leaving Baltimore
for Washington...
and if you wanted to,
you could meet her tonight.
- Tonight? Where?
- In front of the statue of Benjamin Franklin at 8:00.
Miss Jones, you don't know
what you're saying.
I'm the happiest guy in the world!
Wait a minute. You've gotta help me.
Where will I take her?
Every place in Washington
is packed with people.
I want to be alone with her...
someplace, if I take her in my arms,
she'll naturally cuddle up.
Maybe a carriage ride.
No, the driver hears everything you say.
- A walk in the park?
- That's worse. Too many people.
- You hear everything they say.
- I've got it.
- What?
- A moonlight picnic.
If you could have someone put up a box
supper for two and get a portable radio-
- I can get those all right, but where in
Washington- - Why not right on the mall?
With moonlight on the water,
it would be awfully romantic...
and, I've heard,
sometimes awfully lonesome.
Miss Jones, you're wonderful!
You're terrific!
You're-
Just showing her
a Japanese stranglehold, Chief.
If this keeps up, she won't be here
long enough to use it.
Penny for your thoughts?
I was thinking of your secretary and what
a lovely person she was to suggest this place.
It must be nice to have
such a sweet girl in your office.
I'd much rather think
of the sweet girl I have in my arms.
I wonder if you'll always feel
that way towards me, Tommy.
- Always.
- Even if something happened?
- Of course, darling.
- I wish I could be sure.
What makes you say that?
Oh, I don't know. l-
- Lorraine.
- Yes?
When a fella's liable to go away...
maybe for a long time...
do you think he has a right to-
well, to ask a girl to wait for him?
If he loves her, I think he has.
But you're joining the U.S.O. show.
You don't know where you'll be or-
I haven't had much luck
with the U.S.O. show, Tommy.
There's too many big stars
ahead of me.
I was thinking of going back home
to Missour- uh, Kansas City...
and- and forgetting the stage.
That's a fine thing.
With all your talent? Why, it's ridiculous.
Oh, no, it isn't.
I don't mind giving up the stage.
Besides, Washington wouldn't
be the same if you went away.
you've been listening to the music
of Charlie Spivak and his band...
coming to you from the opening tonight of
Washington's newest and smartest nightclub...
the Club Diplomacy.
What's the matter with us?
There's the solution to our whole problem.
Eddie Hall! Why, he's right here
in Washington opening up his club tonight.
That Miss, um-
you know, the singer-
She's been sending me telegrams
and letters, begging me to come.
- But, Tommy- - We'll grab a taxi
and go over to the Club Diplomacy.
- But listen-
- Not to one word.
I'm gonna make Eddie Hall give you a break
if it takes an act of Congress.
All kidding aside, folks, you've made me
the happiest boy in the world.
Why, just two minutes ago
Senator Novacall stopped me, and he said...
"Mr. Hall"-
He called me by my maiden name.
"Mr. Hall," he said,
"I want to congratulate you.
Your opening is the biggest
we've ever had in Washington."
Oh.
Now I know what he meant.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
that cheerful little earful of corn...
Miss Molly McKay!
Ladies and gentlemen
attention, please
You've got to listen to me
Here's an extra special communiqué
Just arrived today
From Washington, D.C.
Pretty little milkmaid
milk that cow
Say there, you
grab ahold of that plow
We gotta do a heap of farmin' now
We're on a Yankee-Doodle hayride
Run your little tractor
Stack that wheat
Your big boy and his buddy must eat
We need a lot of starch
for marching feet
We're on a Yankee-Doodle hayride
Oh, there ain't gonna
be no hoedown
Till we knock the foe down
Neighbor
we just can't slow down
Got to go
Got to go like blazes
Soldiers in khaki
Sailors in blue
Cannot be any prouder than you
A pair of overalls is a uniform too
We're on a Yankee-Doodle hayride
Hey, hey
What do you say
We gotta have beans
and gotta have tomatoes
Come along, rain
We gotta have crops
lowa corn and Idaho potatoes
Fatten that calf
We got to have chops
If you want to win
you've gotta pitch in
If you want to pitch in
then you've gotta pitch hay
Hey, hey
Are you goin' away
Way down yonder in a cornfield
Soldiers in khaki
Sailors in blue
Cannot be any prouder than you
A pair of overalls is a uniform too
Your Uncle Sam is calling you
To come and hitch your wagon
to a Yankee-Doodle
Cock-a-doodle-doodle hayride
Having you folks drop in is all I needed
to make the evening complete.
- You're sweet to say that.
- Looks like you're having a big opening night, Eddie.
A sellout.
Hey, what's going on
between you two anyway?
Hmm. I get it.
Well, he's a great guy, Miss Lorraine.
I've known this son of a gun ever since
he wore three-cornered pants.
As a matter of fact, I loaned you
the dough to buy your first long ones.
- That's right.
- Yeah.
I guess that shows you where I stand.
And you think he wouldn't do me a favor?
- Favor? Are you short? Do you need dough?
- Oh, no, no.
- There is something else.
- Just ask. You've got it.
- You're going out on a limb.
- For you, I'll chop it off.
- Mr. Hall, l-
- You're sure?
Positive. Ask me anything. It's done.
Okay. I want you to put
Miss Lorraine in your show.
- Did you say-
- Remember how good she was in New York?
She'll be twice as good here
in Washington.
Didn't I tell you he'd do it?
Didn't I say he was a great guy?
I think you're one
of the nicest persons in the world...
and I appreciate
what you've done for me.
- What's the matter? You sick?
- Oh, no. No, no.
Just a little dizzy from climbing out
on that limb so fast.
- What hit me, a P-38?
- I hit you.
When you signed up that Lorraine girl,
you didn't invite trouble with me, you ensured it.
Now, wait a minute.
Let's talk this thing over sensibly, Molly.
Stay down for a full count or I'll hang a shanty
on your other eye to look like a duplex!
- I'll go for help!
- Help nothing, sister.
You come back in a few minutes, and what's
left of him you can kick under a rug.
Listen, you got this thing all wrong.
I was forced to sign up Miss Lorraine.
Tommy Dooley made me do it.
- Oh, yes? What did he use for persuasion?
- Friendship.
What do you think? I gave in because he was
gonna hit me with a piece of wet lettuce?
I don't care why you gave in!
All I know is I'm through.
- I'm walking out on you right now!
- Molly!
That Lorraine dame took Dooley
away from me in New York...
but I'll choke before I let her parade
in front of me in Washington!
But she isn't gonna
parade herself in front of ya.
You're the star of my show.
She can't compare with ya.
You're my drawing card. Molly!
- Don't you think anything of me?
- Anything?
Everything.
Everything I can think of!
Wait a minute.
For once in your life, be sensible.
- Mmm.
- Even if it's only for the novelty.
Excuse me.
Mmm. A marine.
And "excuse me," he says.
How do you want him to come in?
Throwing hand grenades?
- How do you do?
- What can I do for you?
- I'm looking for someone- Miss Lorraine,
as you call her. - It's her again.
- She gets 'em all.
- Look, brother, will you please go away?
- I got all the trouble I can use.
- Yeah? Well, you're gonna get some more if I don't find her.
- I happen to be engaged to her.
- That's fine. Now, if you'll just run al-
- You're engaged to her?
- That's right.
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.
She gave me this the night
I took her to the train.
- You took her to the train?
- Look, bud, you got the wrong party.
- You didn't take her to the train that night.
- I tell you I did.
I wasn't lettin' those guys
beat my time.
- But they took her to the train too.
- They horned in.
She didn't want 'em.
She says, "George, I'm just bein' nice to them
'cause they're doing their bit.
You're the only one I love."
- She said that to you?
- Sure. Course, she's nice to all the fellas.
That's why she's
such a popular pinup girl.
- Thousands of guys have her picture.
- Pinup girl?
You mean I've got a popular pinup girl in my show,
and I'm not letting the public know?
Miss Lorraine
won't be here until tonight...
so why don't you and I sort of plan
a little surprise for her?
- Well, that's fine.
- Pardon us.
Wait a minute, Molly.
You're not going anyplace with him.
- If she wants to, who's gonna stop her?
- Yeah. You keep out of this.
War is war. Oh, and by the way,
reserve a table for Miss Lorraine's fiancé.
He's going to be
our honored guest tonight.
You look good, Ed.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Once too often
You're gonna step out
once too often
I'm gettin' mighty sick and tired
Of totin' the torch for you
So just be careful
brother
I, too
can find another
Remember anything that you do
I can do too
Once too often
I'll get the go-by once too often
And then you'll have
to change your tune
And sing in a different key
That line that you've been usin'
Will cease to be amusin'
It's gonna boomerang
When you come lookin' for me
Say, you're a wizard
when it comes to cryin'
A master in the art of alibi-in'
Go on and do
your tall and fancy lyin'
Baby, but you will say you're sorry
Once too often
You're gonna weep
but I won't soften
You're gonna whimper like a pup
The day I catch up with you
Step out, go on and show off
Some night the lid will blow off
You're gonna give my heart
the business once too often
- Stick around. I'll be back in a minute.
- Hey. Where you goin', sailor?
I'm going backstage and pop
a mighty important question.
Keep your fingers crossed
that I get the right answer.
Come on now, girls. You go
and get ready for your next number.
- Oh, Tommy, can you spare a minute?
- Well, l-l-l-
I've got a surprise. It's for Miss Lorraine.
I thought maybe you'd want to get in on it.
- Well, you bet your life I would. What is it?
- I'll show you.
Tommy Dooley, meet George Davis.
- How are ya?
- Very well, thanks.
- How are you?
- Isn't this wonderful, you meeting him?
Well, sure, but I don't quite understand.
What's this all about?
Well, George is Miss Lorraine's fiancé,
only she doesn't know it yet.
Oh, yes, she does.
She told me so herself.
- She doesn't know you're here.
- I don't get this.
She doesn't know he's in town.
We were gonna wait until after her number,
then all of us were gonna walk in on her.
Will she be happy- success in the show
and getting her boyfriend back in one night.
And she deserves it.
She's got what it takes.
- That, my friend, is an understatement.
- You a friend of hers too?
In a way. Course, it was only casual.
Very casual.
Thanks, Molly, for saving me
from doing something very silly.
Glad to have seen you.
Best of luck to you both.
He's not a very sociable guy, is he?
He's been looking out a porthole too long.
What are we waitin' for?
I'll change all my advertising. I'll bill you
as the nation's number-one pinup girl.
Everybody in Washington'll be packin' the joint.
I'll give you the biggest publ-
- Surprise! Look who's here.
- Lorry!
- How do you do?
- Don't you remember me?
Oh, yes. Of course.
It was at a dinner party, wasn't it?
- Now, was it in Pittsburgh or-
- It was in Missoula at a dance, and you know it.
You're engaged to him.
Don't you remember?
Molly, if this is gonna be a fight,
remember it's a private one.
George! Now I place you!
Well, it's about time
we got to know each other better.
And maybe it's about time
we had something understood.
See, I'm engaged to 500 boys, but that doesn't
say I'm gonna marry each one of them.
- I'll say you're not.
- No.
You can include Tommy Dooley in that 500, too,
because you're not gonna marry him either.
- I fixed that.
- What do you mean, you fixed it?
I introduced George to Tommy,
and I told him you two were engaged.
You did? Where is he?
From the way he left, by now,
he's probably flying over the equator.
Oh.
Now you've really fixed it.
Well, how did I know
she was engaged to 500 other guys?
You didn't wanna
get married anyway, did ya?
"Dear Tommy, it is hard to explain
what happened last night.
"There is so much
I would like to tell you.
"If you will see me,
I'm sure I can make you understand...
"and you won't think so badly of me.
"Please leave a message with your stenographer.
I will phone her.
Miss Jones, if Miss Lorraine calls,
tell her I don't want any part of her.
- You don't?
- Never.
- That's being awfully hard-hearted.
- She made a fool out of me.
What do you expect me to do?
Congratulate her?
Maybe you don't understand.
I think her letter was beautiful.
- I'm sure she's terribly unhappy.
- Don't let her fool you.
She's probably laughing up her sleeve.
She's engaged to another guy.
The chief was right. He told me
she was playing me for a chump all the time.
- Why are you sticking up for her?
- I'm not.
I think she's a silly person who
probably didn't realize how serious-
Baloney. Let's skip the whole thing.
I don't wanna think about it.
It's over. From now on,
it's a thing of the past.
What did I tell you,
you irresponsible, seagoing Romeo?
Look at that. She's done it.
And she had the colossal gall to pull it right
under the nose of the navy department.
She's followed you to Washington.
Didn't I tell you she was out to exploit you?
Wait a minute, Chief.
You don't have to worry about her anymore.
I brushed her off for good last night.
One with a bow line like that?
How could you do it?
What's the difference? All that matters
is we're washed up, and that's final.
- You sure?
- Positively.
She's out of my life forever.
Well.
- Forever?
- Yes. Forever.
I had it coming.
I was a sap to fall for an actress
in the first place.
I'm not the type,
and I should've known it.
- But you're being so hasty.
- I'm not being hasty. I'm just being sensible.
If I had a brain in my head,
I'd fall for a girl like- like you-
a girl who's sincere and honest
and has both feet on the ground.
- Did you say like me?
- Yes. You.
You wouldn't think of deceiving
a fellow or lying to him.
You're the kind of a girl a fellow needs.
The ceiling's gonna fall
right down on my head.
- What'd you say?
- Oh- Oh, l- Oh-
I said I broke the lead.
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you doing tonight?
- Oh, I've got a date.
- Break it. I'm taking you to dinner.
Have you ever been
to the Club Diplomacy?
- Well, not exactly. l-
- Well, that's where we're going.
- Dooley, come in here.
- Okay, Chief. Coming.
I'll be back in a minute.
Talk yourself out of this one,
Laura Jones.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Dooley, but I don't
think it's right for us to come here.
After all, I'm your stenographer,
and people might talk.
Nonsense. You're not going
to run into anybody you know.
And besides, they'll probably
stick us behind a marble pillar.
- Telephone, Mr. Hall. They're calling you from backstage.
- Thanks.
- Hi, Eddie.
- Tommy.
I want to talk to you.
Be with you in just a second.
- Mario, get Mr. Dooley a ringside table.
- This way, please.
- Nice break.
- Mmm.
What?
Miss Lorraine isn't here yet?
But her number goes on in five minutes.
I'll be right there.
- Good evening. A single, sir?
- Yes. I'd like to be pretty well down front.
- I'm kind of hard of hearing.
- Yes, sir. This way, please.
- Have you had any luck?
- No, sir, and I've tried calling every place I can think of.
- Including the receiving hospital.
- This is all your fault.
If you hadn't brought that marine backstage
last night, I wouldn't be in this jam.
Listen, brother,
don't start throwing punches at me.
You'd better figure out what you're
gonna tell that audience out there.
Tommy Dooley is out front. Maybe he can
tell us where she is. Stay on that phone.
- With the dinner, I want the best champagne in the house.
- Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Dooley, but isn't this
a rather expensive way to get even?
You think that's the only reason
I brought you here?
I can't think of any other.
Can you?
Well, let's not talk about it.
Miss Lorraine goes on in two minutes, and
then you can see how little she means to me.
I wouldn't be at all surprised
if she didn't go on tonight.
- What makes you say that?
- By the tone of her letter.
- She sounded awfully upset.
- Well, she should be.
Pardon me, Tommy.
Meet my secretary.
Miss Jones, Mr. Hall.
How do you do?
Good evening. Have you talked
to Miss Lorraine today?
No. And what's more,
I don't care if I ever do.
Oh, boy, am I in a spot. She's supposed to
go on right now, and she hasn't shown up.
- Do you think anything's happened to her?
- I don't know.
I've called every place in town,
including the receiving hospitals.
- Have you tried the morgue?
- The morgue?
- You don't think for a minute she could've-
- Now, wait. Don't get excited.
People can be missing without being dead.
Miss Jones, why didn't you make me
get in touch with her this morning?
Well, don't just stand there.
Why don't you do something?
There's only one thing I can do: announce
to the crowd she won't appear tonight.
I'm not thinking about your show.
I'm worried about Miss Lorraine.
- We've got to find her. - Don't jump on me.
If you hadn't walked out on her last night-
- Pardon me, Mr. Hall. May I speak with you?
- Yeah. What is it?
Miss McKay wants to know
if you want her to go on first.
- Certainly. She'll have to. Tell her to get ready.
- Yes, sir.
- What do you mean,
if I hadn't walked out on her?
Listen, children
Listen to your teacher
Pay attention and learn your ABC's
And when you grow up
you can be a quiz kid
Or a guest of honor
Listen, children
Listen to your teacher
You gotta know your figures
if you wanna be considered bright
Tell us more
oh, teacher
Tell us more
more, more
Listen, children
Listen to your teacher
A boy plus a girl
Plus a rendezvous
Adds up to something
divided by two
Tell us more, oh, teacher
Tell us more
Much more
Tell us more
Teacher
If you wanna be teacher's pet
Here's a little motto
that you mustn't
No, you dasn't ever forget
Don't carry tales out of school
'Cause if you do
you're a fool
You mustn't tell
everything you know
And keep it to yourself
that I love you so much
Don't
Don't tell tall tales
Make it a rule
And though a busybody may insist
Don't let on that we've kissed
If you're a blabbermouth
you're off my list
So don't be a stubborn mule, baby
Don't carry tales
Tell us more, oh, teacher
Tell us more
There's nothing but ridicule for
a blabbermouth who breaks the rule
Don't carry tales
Out of school
- That girl's a blonde bomber.
- I don't know. I was engaged to her once.
What? You too?
What is this? An epidemic?
Just about.
She's engaged to 500 other guys.
Here comes one of them now.
Wait a minute.
How dare you disobey orders?
Didn't I tell you to stay away from her, and
didn't you tell me this morning you were through?
Yeah, but look, Chief.
I gotta find out what this is all about.
I'll tell you what it's all about.
She's out to trap you.
You're all wrong.
She's engaged to a marine.
She is not!
He just told me it was all off.
- Are you sure?
- Certainly I'm sure.
- I told you you don't know anything about women.
- Thanks.
- Wait a minute. Where you going?
- To take your advice, Chief, and learn about women.
Hello there. Long time no see.
- No, you don't, Tommy.
- Oh, now, Eddie.
- Not now. She's changing her costume for the next number.
- Be reasonable.
Did, did, did-d-d-d-did you hear
The story of the very merry widow
The merry widow
used to go for waltzes
And she danced a minuet
surprisingly swell
But she threw her waltzes away
Yep, the widow is hep today
Now the little lady
likes to do the rumba
And she really does it socko
At the Stork and El Morocco
Where they say she knows
her sambas very, very well
The merry widow
used to go for operas
In the royal box
she looked majestically swell
Now she gives her tickets away
And she's right in the groove today
For the little lady
likes a bit of boogie-woogie
And she traded Traviata
for a trumpet's ra-ta-ta-ta
And they say she digs her jivin'
Very, very well
When it was teatime
she used to stop in
For a cup of tea
with Mrs. Abercrombie
But now at teatime
she likes to drop in
For a double scotch and soda
or a Zombie
The merry widow
Wore the smartest dresses
In the sheerest black
she looked excitingly swell
But she packed her pretties away
Wears a uniform every day
Now the little lady
has no time for dancing
Does her job with great devotion
She's a cinch for big promotion
And they say she does her duties
very, very well
Very, very well
Now she hasn't any time for sambas
And she hasn't a minute
to spare for boogie-woogie
Hip-hip hooray
She's on her way
No time to play now
This merry little widow
is a busy little widow
Working for the U.S.A.
