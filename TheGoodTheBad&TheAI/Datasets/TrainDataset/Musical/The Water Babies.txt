Fresh fish here, caught this morning!
It's a bargain!
Look what I've got to show you here.
I have 12 wonderful plates for one shilling.
Here's a bargain you'll not see
in this market for years to come.
The late Lord Marsbury wore this.
Farthing. Thank you, Miss.
Sir, join the army? Queen's shilling.
Matches! Spare a farthing!
Lady, give us a farthing!
Just a farthing for the baby!
Fresh rabbits, caught today!
Come along, now!
- Here we are, some lovely Yorkshire hams!
- Lovely pies!
Pies!
York pies!
Hot pies!
Come on, now! Get your pies!
Ha'penny a pie!
I repeat, for the first time,
you have your last chance to see...
...Madame Doasyouwouldbedoneby
in her greatest role...
...the head of an Indian princess.
Just the head! A living head!
Not the body, just the head!
A miracle of our time! Roll up!
Only a penny a ticket!
A penny a ticket! Roll up!
For the first time in your fair city
see Madame Doasyouwouldbedoneby...
Come on now. Keep moving.
Only a face. Move on.
No body.
- Come on, sir. Keep moving.
- Fantastic.
Sensational. Move on, laddie. Move on.
Come on, keep moving.
Go on, son. Keep moving.
Keep moving.
Come on now. Keep moving.
Keep moving.
Only a head.
Move on, move on!
Roll up! Roll up!
For the first time in your fair city!
I repeat, for the first time,
you have your last chance to see...
...Madame Doasyouwouldbedoneby
in her greatest role...
...the head of an Indian princess.
Where hast you been, Thomas?
Where hast you been?
Hast ever seen such an ungrateful wretch
as this, Mr. Masterman?
Can't say as I ever had wished to,
Mr. Grimes.
What happens to apprentices
what dodge their masters, Damiel?
They're flogged
and deported to Botany Bay.
Is our young cockney whelp aware of that?
- Work, is it, Mr. Grimes?
- Aye, work, very important work.
We have an appointment at Harthover Hall.
High cockalorum?
Very high cockalorum!
Come on, Wilfred.
Harthover Hall?
- High cockalorum, indeed!
- Indeed!
Get your pies! York pies!
Pies! York pies!
Lovely pies!
Ha'penny a pie!
York pies!
Foolish.
It's dangerous, Damiel.
Yes, but do you want to be
a chimney sweep...
...all your life, Mr. Grimes?
Or a toff with a coach and four
and a pack of servants?
Or a snapped neck if they catch us.
You know what they say
about Harthover Hall, Mr. Grimes?
What do they say about Harthover?
Speak up, lad, or I'll knock thy eyes out.
They say it's got more chimneys...
...than I've had clouts across me ear,
old Mr. Grimes.
And here's another one.
Stay down there till I tell thee!
Here.
Have a good swig of that, and get to sleep.
It's a long day tomorrow.
If this works tomorrow...
...we're made men.
Made men!
Good night, boy.
It's time you were up, Mrs. Crodgely.
Come on. Good boy.
Where's this then, Mr. Grimes?
"Where's this then?"
China.
Where dost thou think?
Yorkshire. Can't thou see it's Yorkshire?
I know it's Yorkshire, Mr. Grimes.
Well, then...
I've never seen it clean before.
We're in the country.
Is that what they call it?
Lovely, isn't it, Mr. Grimes?
- I shall retire here.
- Shut up.
Walk on, Wilfred.
Come on, you, take this dog!
Get a hold of this.
And keep up!
Get!
Come on, Wilfred.
There you are.
Harthover Hall.
I shall retire there instead.
Don't be daft.
Young Thomas,
that enough chimneys for thee?
I shan't be through sweeping those
before Christmas, Mr. Grimes.
Wilfred, come.
Next year.
This ain't no burial ground.
What's your business?
What's our business?
We've come to clean chimneys.
What's it look like?
I thought you was the undertaker,
going to bury him.
He is dead, isn't he? Walking dead?
And see you don't come out
with more than you went in with!
What does he mean?
We've got no time for poachers.
Poaching? Perish the thought!
A nasty suggestion,
killing poor, dumb beasts.
It's nasty, very nasty.
And just remember...
...Squire Harthover
is the Justice of the Peace.
And it's the gallows in these parts...
...for fellows that take things
that don't belong to them.
So think on.
We'll do that. We'll think on.
Come on. Come on, Wilfred.
Not front.
Around back.
What a disgusting,
filthy disgrace to humanity you are.
I'm Grimes, missis.
You're drunk, sir.
Nevertheless, I'm Grimes.
Now, does thou want
the chimneys swept...
...or does thou not want
the chimneys swept?
Ta.
Come in.
You can leave that thing outside
for a start.
Hurry up, quick. Here.
Mr. Grimes, baskets and bags.
Now then, listen to me, all of you.
I've just sheeted all the rooms
where there's chimneys to be swept.
You brought plenty of soot bags, I see.
- Aye.
- Use them!
Because I warn you...
...one speck of soot
in any of those rooms...
...and not a penny piece
will you get from me.
Yes, ma'am.
- Missis.
- Come on, get on with it then!
I'll wait outside, Mr. Grimes,
to collect the soot bags.
Right.
Mr. Grimes...
Come on.
No dust covers.
Come on.
Take the brush.
On the way and earn the keep.
It's dark up here, Mr. Grimes.
Get up there!
Else I'll light a fire and burn the bum.
No, Mr. Grimes!
Please, no. Not me bum.
Upsy-daisy, Thomas, lad.
It's wonderful what a bit of kindness
will do for them young wretches.
It's dark. I can't see a blooming thing.
Shut up!
Keep going, lad.
Cor blimey!
Me brush! Where's me brush?
I'll get a clout if I can't find me brush.
- Thomas?
- Yeah?
- Come on, lad, down this way!
- What way, Mr. Grimes?
This way!
- This way, and sharp about it!
- Right-o, Mr. Grimes!
Hurry up, lad!
Coming, Mr. Grimes.
Thomas, what are thou up to?
I can't find me way, Mr. Grimes!
What way should I go?
I'm lost!
I've lost meself!
Then find thyself, and quick about it!
Cor!
Who are you?
Blimey!
Who are you, boy?
Don't shout, please.
I'm not.
I'm only a chimney sweep,
come down the chimney. See?
I lost me way.
You've come down the chimney, boy?
Yeah.
But how terrible for you.
Aren't you frightened, being in the dark?
Sometimes,
but I'm more frightened of Mr. Grimes.
- Mr. Grimes?
- He clouts me.
- Clouts you?
- Hits me regular, across the earhole.
- Why don't you tell your parents?
- Me what?
Your mother and father.
I ain't got no mum or dad. Never did.
Grimes said I was hatched out
in the London gutter by the sun.
You got a mum or dad?
No.
They died in Vienna last year on holiday.
Not much of a holiday?
Sorry.
You've got no mum or dad, like me.
Same sort of difference.
Who looks after you, then?
My uncle and aunt.
Sir John and Lady Harriet.
Blimey. Royalty!
This is their house.
Must be worth a few bob.
Paradise, this is. My idea of paradise.
What did they do that to him for?
- Who is he?
- Jesus.
- Who?
- God.
He's got the right room for it, hasn't he?
Paradise.
What's your name, boy?
Thomas.
Thomas Aquinas something-or-other.
"Something-or-other"?
You don't get no last name
if you ain't got no mum or dad.
It's the rules. I'm just Tom.
- Who are you?
- I'm Ellie.
Ellie? That's a very pretty name, miss.
Highly classy.
But it would be, living here.
You couldn't be a Gertie or a Ruby,
could you, living here?
- What was that?
- I don't know.
But you see,
noise is not allowed in this house.
Tom!
Be careful.
Mr. Grimes! What you doing?
Thieving?
Ellie?
Ellie! Are you all right?
What's going on there?
What's all that noise?
Are you all right, Ellie?
Miss Ellie!
Why, the young thief!
What do you mean, Mr. Grimes?
- The boy's a thief!
- I'm not!
- No, he's not!
- Ellie...
- But he isn't!
- That's enough.
I'll have him hanged for thee.
Stop, thief!
- Will you come back here?
- Nobody ever listens to me!
I've something very important to tell you!
Toby!
Sir John! Lady Harriet!
Let me go! You can't push me around!
Let me go!
I have to tell you! Leave me alone!
Ellie, be quiet, child.
What is it, Mrs. Tripp?
What is it, Mrs. Tripp?
Hang fire, dear heart, I've just asked that.
So have I, dear. I have a right to know.
What is it, Mrs. Tripp?
A thief, milady.
Pinched all the silver, milady.
Pinched the silver?
Really? What's "pinched," dear?
Purloined, my love.
Somebody's stolen the silver!
God save the mark. Call the justice, John.
Call the justice!
I am the justice, dear.
Are you really, dear?
No one tells me anything.
Morning.
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief.
Someone has pinched me silver.
Stop, thief!
It wasn't the boy. It wasn't Tom.
It wasn't him. He isn't a thief.
It was the old man Mr. Grimes!
It wasn't him!
Stop, thief!
Masterman?
Yes, Mr. Grimes?
Find that boy, Mr. Masterman.
He's been stealing off Sir John's property.
Quick as you like, Mr. Grimes.
Stop, thief!
Who in particular are we looking for?
Mr. Masterman, please, shut up.
A boy, sir.
A wicked boy.
Indeed? A boy?
There was a lad, minutes ago,
running across the fields.
It were your lad. I saw him.
He shan't escape.
I shall find him
and make an example of him.
We'll hunt the young scoundrel,
if necessary, across all Yorkshire!
To horse!
Me lip! Mr. Grimes!
Stop, thief!
Come on, Wilfred boy.
Come on! That's right.
Come on, Mr. Grimes!
They went back the other way. Get up.
Blasted boots! I'll tell Uncle John.
He'll listen to me. It wasn't Tom.
Ellie, come back here this minute!
Come back here, I say!
Run, boy. Run!
It's me war wound.
Get up.
Wilfred's giving out.
I hope that nag throws her
and breaks her neck.
How did she cross you, Mr. Grimes?
She saw me throw the swag to Thomas.
Here. If she can convince Squire,
it'll be... for me.
We best get going, then!
I don't mind looking like a corpse,
but I don't want to die like one.
Come on, Wilfred. Come on, lad.
Up you get, Joshua. Come on.
Come on now, Wilfred.
Go on, Wilfred, lad.
Come on.
Giddy up.
Mr. Grimes...
...who is he?
Ignore him.
There, sir. There he is.
There he is, sir.
Come back, lad!
Come back! You'll fall!
By George!
He may be a thief,
but he's a plucky little beggar.
Uncle John!
I've something very important
I must tell you!
It wasn't Tom! It was the sweep!
- What?
- The sweep, Mr. Grimes!
Good Lord!
If he slips, he'll kill himself.
He's like a frightened little rabbit.
We mustn't scare him.
No, Sir John. Don't try it.
It's too dangerous. Follow me.
I know a better way down.
Don't try and jump, lad.
It's not called Dead Man's Pool for nothing.
You jump in there, son,
and you won't come up.
Steady, now.
We can't save you if you fall.
He's right, my dear boy.
Now, you listen to me very carefully.
No harm will come to you, I promise.
But, for goodness' sake, stay still!
Stay perfectly still!
Tom! They know it wasn't you.
Tom!
Tom, don't!
I've gone all clean.
Here, Toby! Look, I'm clean!
I thought you were a goner.
You know what?
I've got a funny feeling we're underwater!
What's going on here?
Having trouble, Mister?
What's it look like?
What exactly are you trying to do?
Can't you see? Swim!
- Get off!
- What is he?
What sort of fish are you?
What are you?
I'm Tom.
- Tom? But what's a Tom, then?
- A boy, that's what!
- A human!
- And what might that be?
Just the highest form of animal life,
that's all.
It doesn't look much like it
from where I'm floating.
Know his trouble?
He doesn't know how to swim!
Doesn't know how to swim?
Isn't my fault.
- Things as don't swim...
- Got no right to be here.
No!
Why don't you go back
where you came from?
Blimey, I wish I could,
but I don't know how, do I?
Why don't you leave me alone?
Go on! Swing your hook.
Now, no need for that kind of language.
In underwater society, young creature,
we try to avoid words like "hook."
Particularly amongst mixed company.
- Lady wife.
- Thank you, dear.
Sorry, missis.
Now, do I understand
you've never swum before?
- I've never had a bath before!
- Quite. Don't look so miserable about it.
All it takes is a little perseverance.
I have... What's it, missis.
Look.
- Whoops! There you go.
- I just sink!
Then you must keep on persevering.
Leave off!
"When you're sinking fast
"And you think you won't last
"Got to try a little harder
"When you slip and slide
"Got to swallow your pride
"And try a little harder
"Never say die
"You know you'll get by

No, I ain't.

Otters!
Hold up.
What?
Take a switch at that.
- Food!
- Food!
Charge!
Every fish for himself!
Get out of my way!
Stay right there, Scout.
Come here, you.
You, in that funny shirt.
I'll soon sort you out.
Come on. Lay off!
Where's he gone?
Hello, what have we here?
Me nose!
Hey, chubby chops!
- You in the soppy hat!
- Soppy hat?
Why don't you go for
someone your own size?
Soon sort you out.
Right!
It comes to something
when a fellow's dinner starts fighting back.
You must be one of those
downstream mob.
- No, I come from up there.
- Up there? You're a long way from home.
Don't I know it.
But someone like you,
who knows his way about...
...perhaps you could show us
the way to get back up.
No argument there, son.
- Only thing is the dangers.
- What dangers?
Otter hounds. Only one sniff of me,
and it's, cheerio, here comes supper!
- Who can help me?
- Your best chance'd be the water babies.
- Water babies? Never heard of them.
- They're not from around these parts.
Right out at sea, they are.
Which way is right out at sea?
Downstream.
That's for us, then, Toby. Come on, boy.
Thanks, Mr. Otter.
That's the last anyone'll see of them.
Serves them right.
That'll teach you to fight fur.
The way I see it...
...these water babies must have
more sense than all them fish.
And if they can put us on the road back,
I can see Ellie again.
What's that?
Turn back!
Rapids!
Help!
Toby, where are you?
Help!
I feel rotten.
How about you?
Let's find some clean water.
Never heard of being under-the-seasick.
They ought to put milestones down here.
No way of telling where you are.
What an idiot!
That's what I am.
A right prune, if you know what I mean.
I feel such a dafty!
Stuck here like a pound of crabmeat,
know what I mean?
Swum these waters for 40 years...
...lad and lobster, 40 years,
and what do I do?
Fall for a wee trap. What a talent.
Jimmy, what are you staring at?
Just wondering,
why are you holding on to that thing?
Why am I holding on?
That's great, that is.
Do you not see
the daft thing is holding on to me?
- Perhaps I can help.
- That's downright offensive.
If I can't do it with my strength...
...what use would be a poor,
wee soggy like you?
Maybe your head's loose,
but your wee heart's in the right place.
Give us a hand, then.
Take a grip on that bar. Now!
Heave! Heave!
Heave hard!
It's useless, know what I mean?
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah, what is it?
The lobster snatcher.
Haul away, then! I'll be boiling tonight.
No!
Give up, Jimmy, I'm dead.
Not yet, you're not!
Leave go, or they'll be serving you up
with mayonnaise and all.
- One last try. Heave!
- Pipe clay up the lum!
We've done it! We beat them!
Not we, you.
Jimmy, you saved my life.
I'm Tom.
Give us your hand, then.
You're greetin'. What's that for?
It's just,
I never saved a lobster's life before.
You have now. Jock of the Orkneys.
Come on, laddie, let's come away deeper.
The water babies, is it?
As I've heard tell...
...they're the wee 'uns got that place
in the middle ocean.
- Yeah?
- And I have it on good authority...
...it's great there, you know what I mean?
But where is it?
Where is the middle ocean?
It's too far for a wee scruff like you
to be going on your own.
Apart from the normal hazards
of sea travel...
...there's that hairy great killer shark.
Them water babies are my only chance.
If I don't reach them,
I'll never get back up there to Ellie.
You'll not do it
on your own wee, silly self...
...not without someone reliable
to be your guide.
- Yes, but who?
- That's no problem.
You'll come along with us?
High cockalorum, Toby!
- What's "high cockalorum"?
- For me, it's pies to eat, free beer...
...and somewhere to sleep warm
when it rains.
That high cockalorum. I ken that word.
"High cockalorum
"Means lots of things to me
"A Saturday night in Glasgow
with a lassie on me knee
"The swirl of a kilt, the magic lilt
"Of a Highland pipe and drum
"It's really grand, you understand
"It's pipe clay up the lum
"And with friends along to sing a song
"And drink a wee, wee jarum
"It's Scots wa hae Hogmanay
"High cockalorum
"High, high, high, high
"High cockalorum
"High cockalorum
"Happy to be in your company
"High, high, high, high
"High cockalorum
"High cockalorum
"Friends forever, stickin' together
"High, high, high, high
"High cockalorum
"Hey, hey, hey, we're on our way
"We're on our way
"We're on our way
"We're on our way
"We're on our way
"We're on our way"
It's certainly no giggle, this place.
It's what they call the Sargasso Sea.
There ain't no sign of any water babies.
They'll not be far now.
- Blimey! Take a look at that boat!
- Aye, a right ship's graveyard.
All the buccaneers and the privateers
that searched for gold of the Spanish Main.
This is where they all ended,
down in the depths, drowned.
Don't you know any funny stories?
What's that?
That's the haunter.
I'm getting out!
It can't get in here, can it?
No chance.
Hello!
That about frightened you, didn't it?
For years, I've been patrolling these wrecks
waiting for somebody to terrify.
We was terrified, very.
Some was, some wasn't.
That is kind of you.
Tell me, what brings you here?
- No, my wee chum here, you see...
- It's the water babies.
If I find 'em, I can go back up there to Ellie.
- You still got a way to go.
- Not that far. We just carry on due east.
- Due west.
- That's due south.
We'll be there in no...
What do you mean, "south"?
South's where I hear them singing from
sometimes when I'm lonely.
You can come with us
and show us the way.
I'd love to.
I can't tell you what a change it'll be...
...to have companionship.
Steady now. Pipe clay up the lum.
Pleased to meet you.
And mine's Terrence, dear.
You know what, Terrence, dear,
you are high cockalorum!
Nice of you to say so. Now, listen.
This is what high cockalorum means to me.
"High cockalorum
"It really says it all
"It's diamonds and tiaras
"It's the Royal Albert Hall
"It's a musical play, it's terribly gay
"It's high society
"It's lookin' your best,
bein' beautifully dressed
"It's goin' out to tea
"In the end, it's having friends
"I really do adore 'em
"It's heavenly, it's ecstasy
"It's high cockalorum
"High, high, high, high
"High cockalorum
"High cockalorum
"Happy to be in your company
"High, high, high, high
"High cockalorum
"High cockalorum
"Friends forever, stickin' together
"High, high, high, high
"High cockalorum
"Hey, hey, hey, we're on our way
"We're on our way
"We're on our way
"We're on our way
"We're still on our way
"We're on our way"
Are you sure we've gone the right way,
Terrence?
Trust Terrence.
I'm keeping my eyes open for seamarks.
I'm keeping my eyes open
for that killer shark.
Right into our trap.
Right into it.
Rather tragic when you think about it.
Very.
Why are you laughing?
I'm thinking about it.
Bit creepy, isn't it?
I think perhaps we should turn back.
I'm getting foreboding.
No matter how many bodings you get,
we're keeping on!
- Get into single file.
- Can't we get into single file together?
Take them!
What's happening? Let go!
Put me down!
Get away!
Young Tom...
...how nice to see
your dirty little mug again.
But calm down, I'm not eating you yet.
You'll be kept prisoners, all of you...
...till we get the entire
water baby kingdom in chains...
...ready to be my slaves in Shark Castle!
And don't think you can escape.
Our seabed friends are
going to hold you fast!
Blimey, Jock.
Looks like I'll never see Ellie now.
He's alive!
Mrs. Tripp!
Tom's alive!
He's still alive!
Yes, my dear.
I'm sure he is.
Go on, Terrence.
Don't let 'em get you down.
How can they get me
further down than this?
Nothing ever goes right for me!
That's it, have a good weep, Jimmy.
- It's nature's release.
- Talking about release!
Help!
Look!
But what is it?
Something that looks very wrong.
It is, sir.
They've got us prisoners,
and we need help, sir.
A cry for help.
Claude, the bold cavalier.
He puts his sword at your disposal.
for one of my...
...best-known numbers.
I am going to enjoy this.
That's the way to do it!
Lovely!
And I love that hat.
Get 'em!
Here we go!
Take that, that, that, and that!
Very good!
They're running away.
If there's one thing I despise, it's a coward.
Stand and fight, you yellow, lily-livered...
No need to take everything personally.
High cockalorum!
High cockalorum?
You know that song?
I'll show you, my little ones...
...what it really means to me.
I'll tell you.
"High cockalorum is really
"It's camembert,
"It's kissing on the cheek
"A French
"And a lovely Paris night
"The flash of steel that's meant to kill
"The challenge to a fight
"With one, two, three, and four
"Why wait for any more?
I'll lead the way
"To high cockalorum
"High, high, high, high
"High cockalorum
"High cockalorum
"Happy to be in your company
"It's high, high, high, high
"High cockalorum
"High cockalorum
"Friends forever, stickin' together
"High, high, high, high
"High cockalorum
"Hey, hey, hey, we're on our way
"We're on our way
"We're on our way
"We're on our way
"For some swordplay
"For some..." What did you say, then?
I'm sure it all becomes a matter
of finding the water babies...
...before  shark.
To warn 'em about
the horrible things he'll do.
And so they can tell young Tom
how to get back up there.
I see.
No, I don't see!
I don't like being the one to say this...
...but I think your Scottish friend
has got us lost.
Hawd ya whisht.
We're still heading due south.
- East.
- No!
West.
Watch out!
Listen!
To what?
Hear that?
Music!
And it's coming from over there.
"When you hear this sound
"Ringing all around
"It's telling you to come on in
"Come on in

Water babies!

Hello, Tom.
That's the first time
anyone's got my name right.
How did you know?
Water babies just do,
the way you know our names.
You're Alfred.
And you're...
...Ariadne.
- You see?
You're saying I'm a water baby?
Stone me!

"Listen to what it's saying"
On our way down here, we met this pair.
A flipping great shark,
and this sort of lighted-up eel...
...and the things they were swearing
they was gonna do.
While we stay on this playground,
there's nothing that can harm us.
Glad to hear it.
Mind if I ask you about
something else now?
Whatever you want to know.
Where I come from,
there's a girl called Ellie.
Come to think of it,
she looks a bit like you.
- Do you think she's pretty?
- You wouldn't believe it!
Good.

"So listen to what I say
"Dancing
"Singing
"Listen, the bells are ringing
"Music..."
What I'm trying to find, see,
is some way of getting back to her.
So I was wondering...
There's only one being who can decide
if a water baby may return up there.
The Kraken.
The Kraken's terrifying.
He's the Lord of the ocean.
And he lives in a place called
"The other end of nowhere."
Has any water baby ever got to see him?
Yes.
A long time ago,
two of them set out to find him.
But they never came back.
That's the way they set off...
...because it's the only way
to reach the Kraken.
- Through the tunnel.
- That's where we've got to go, then.
Terrence is on his travels again.
Not till you're rested.
Won't tomorrow do?
I suppose so.
I personally am very sleepy.
Tom, you must wake up!
- What's up?
- Wake up!
- What's happening?
- Wake up!
- It's terrible!
- I knew it!
I've been struck down in me prime!
- It's too awful.
- Before me prime!
Everybody's gone! Everybody!
They've been taken.
There was a blue light from the cave,
the gate opened.
Then we heard the voices
of our two lost friends.
So all the babies rushed off towards them.
I warned them not to.
But they went on and...
When they were all inside the cave,
I heard this awful laughter.
That shark's got them.
All of our friends. What can we do?
- We must get help from that Kraken.
- Yes, the lad is right.
adventure is calling us!
Good-bye! Good-bye!
Don't worry, we'll find 'em!
I reckon this is it.
Certainly doesn't look like anywhere else.
The other end of nowhere.
High cockalorum.
This looks like the other end of nowhere.
Think that's here to help us climb up?
Eternity.
-
- Hang about!
On top of that ice, it's air.
Only me and Toby can breathe air.
It's got to be us on our tod.
We'll be back with lots of help.
And we'll not budge from here,
but be awful careful.
'Cause that's what we'll be. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
-  my brave ones.
Wonder what that says.
What's happening?
How dare you!
How...
...dare you!
- Excuse me, guv!
- How...
...dare you!
Out, lad, out! Trespassers will be petrified.
I want to see the Kraken!
You listen to me, you great hearth rug!
I demand to see the Kraken!
"Demand"?
You just might amuse his Lordship.
"Demand," if you don't mind.
Is this him?
Come on. Morning to you, Cyril.
Archie?
This young tearaway
wants to see the Kraken!
- Put his name on the waiting list.
- But nobody's waiting!
He is.
- How long do I wait?
- Till I say so.
- When will that be?
- When I've decided.
- When will you decide?
- When I say you can go.
- Toby! Come on!
- Come back, you imp!
Have you got no respect for formalities?
And what are you laughing at?
"Demand," he said!
The sprat said "demand"!
High cockalorum!
What...
Is there anyone there?
Anybody inside?
Some know me as Neptune...
...Father of the Seas.
Some know me as Poseidon,
the Thunderer.
But most know me as Kraken,
the Earth Shaker.
Not many know me at all. I'm Tom.
Unknown? Uninvited?
Yet you come to me for my help?
- It's two helps, really.
- Two helps?
It's hard, see?
I've got these friends called water babies
trapped in Shark Castle...
...and I want to be allowed
to go back up there.
One choice, and only one.
And it is you who must choose.
If it be the right one,
all will be well with you.
If I pick the wrong one?
You will remain forever captive
in my realm!
So make the choice!
Is it to be this...
...or this?
Make your choice, boy!
Set the water babies free!
So be it!
But they ain't free.
Not yet, for there is one condition.
One condition? That's not fair!
You should've said that first!
I am the Kraken!
I can say things last if I wish!
- What is it, then?
- I, the Kraken, put you to test!
I must see you defeat the shark
and the eel.
What, by meself?
You may make use of your friends...
...your courage, and your wits.
Funny way of going about things, guv.
I shall be watching, boy.
Here.
Listen!
What the governor said
you've got to do is help me.
To beat the shark? He said that?
I don't think that comes
within my polar region.
Not to beat the shark.
- It cannot be done.
- It cannot be done.
Mind you, bit of planning...
Yes, a bit of planning.
Putting heads together?
Respecting the formalities.
Right-o, then! Heads together!
And then, of course, all we have to...
Can we do that?
- Of course, we can!
- But will you do it?
Try keeping us out!
Whoever did that, I'll have him kippered!
To your posts, you miserable ninnies!
Guard the outpost! Sound the...
I'll reduce the lot of you to the ranks!
I'll snap your spines! I'll desiccate you!
I'll have your fins for fritters!
This is no way to run a navy.
Trajectory and distance bang on!
- How was that?
- Right! Our turn, now!
Left, left.
Right a bit. Right a bit.
Who was supposed to be standing guard?
Eel!
- Where are you?
- Just coming, sir!
- At the double!
- I'm on me way, sir!
You overdeveloped worm!
Get up to battlements,
and see what's happening!
Immediately, sir! Like a flash.
A moving blur!
There she goes!
He does irritate me, that shark!
He really does!
No consideration for other fish's feelings.
Self, self, self.
To the battlements, you scum!
Go on! Shake a tail!
Dear!
I'm right behind you!
I said, up, not down, you dunderhead!
Invasion!
- How did we do with that one?
- Right where it hurt!
All together, men!
One moment, if you please.
Let's not have any sloppiness,
not when neatness is possible.
You're an artist, Cyril.
Pride in one's craft.
Push!
On top of the situation, milord?
Sir? Captain?
No!
Now for the big attack!
You go in front. I'll lead.
Hooray!
Charge!
Hooray!
Lose your fear!
Claude is here!
One skillful flick of the nose,
Come on out, before the shark catches us!
Quick!
That's right! Quick!
Get me out of here!
I'm surrounded by incompetents!
Go after those invaders! Annihilate them!
You'll never guess what I've found.
- What?
- How about...
Go on! Great stupid toady!
That's gratitude!
Mutiny, is it?
Yes, it is! What about that, big mouth?
When the boot's on the other foot,
it doesn't taste so good, does it?
I didn't mean it, sir!
I was only trying to cheer you up!
No, it was only in fun! Please!
Get a move on!
- Sharks at the rear!
- It is fighting time!
Jock! There are too many for him!
Hold on, Claude!
- See that gate?
- Aye, the portcullis.
- Lf we drop it, they'll be trapped.
- But it'll take some doing.
- I'm going through!
- Watch it here, Tom!
Easy in there!
Looks like a big drum!
- And a lever!
- That'll be it!
The brake on the capstan!
If you can free the brake...
It's stuck!
There must be a way!
Here!
You've done it, laddie!
That should keep 'em busy for a wee while!
Enough for us to escape ourselves!
- Very satisfactory effort.
- A job well done!
You'll just never believe
what's happening down below!
Get off! Stop it!
I'll cut your current off or whatever that is!
No, you mustn't touch me current!
No, please! Don't cut me current off!
That's nasty!
- I wouldn't do that to me worst enemy!
- I'll defuse you!
No, don't defuse me! Please!
I don't want to be defused!
I like being alive!
What shall I do when the nights get dark?
Mummy! Stop him!
- A mighty victory!
- Pipe clay up the lum!

Now, this has got to be
one of the governors.
You're not kidding! I know him!
I did keep an eye on you, Tom.
By choosing to plead for others,
rather than yourself...
...I can now grant you your own plea.
You may go back up there.
You gonna leave us, Tom?
But there is still the matter
of
We shouldn't keep him
from young Ellie and that.
Good-bye, then, Claude.
I'll never meet a braver sword fighter
than you!
And Terrence,
you may think you're a bit of a seaweed...
...but when it's needed, you give your all.
I do, don't I?
And you, me old mate...
One friend I'll never forget
is Jock of the Orkneys.
Get away home.
Pipe clay up the lum!
What does that mean?
"Keep your chimney clean."
The relief!
I thought it was rude.
- Good-bye, Tom.
Good-bye, Tom. Don't forget us.
Good-bye, Tom.
- Good-bye, Terrence.
- Good luck.
Good-bye.
Tom.
Good-bye!
Blimey! Harthover!
Hello?
There's got to be someone about.
Somebody is about, young jailbait!
Who would have thought
to see this wretch again, Damiel?
Not I, Mr. Grimes.
Not I. And his little pup, as well.
Be quiet, Wilfred!
Why aren't you two hanged, then?
Growing up,
back-answering the elders and betters?
Thou hast got a lot of punch and gall...
...but I'll bring thee back to heel
soon enough.
Not so hasty, young fella!
Thy master's still got work for thee!
Get outside of that!
More?
It was Providence what sent thee tonight,
Thomas.
For we mean to sweep out Harthover Hall
good and proper.
You ain't!
Not after last time!
They think it was thee.
If he gets troublesome,
he'll have his neck stretched.
Now, pay attention.
After one try, they won't expect another.
So we clean up,
and then we're away to London.
Thou'll get thy share, Thomas.
Old Grimes was never stingy...
...was he, Damiel?
Not ever, Mr. Grimes!
No, never, Mr. Grimes.
Now, give me the dog,
and get up the drainpipe.
And move along.
And up to that there window what's open.
Then go downstairs,
and let us in by this here back door.
Don't be thinking of warning anybody.
Because I've got your little pup here!
And if you cross us,
I'll break his neck as quick as you like!
Keep moving!
Come on.
Go on!
Pipe clay up the lum!
Tom!
Stay exactly where you are!
Stay exactly where you are!
I just said that, dear.
So have I, dear. Say it again.
Stay exactly where you are!
That's him, Uncle John!
That's Mr. Grimes!
This time,
I believe we have the real thieves.
And this time, you will not escape!
Won't escape?
Damn his eyes.
I believe he's right.
Blimey!
Mrs. Tripp, you've done a splendid job.
Quite a transformation.
Hardly recognized him.
Highly classy!
What's it say?
Quiet, please, everyone.
On your chair, young Tom, on your chair.
The time has come. Deep breath.
Don't be shy. Speak up. Now, Tom...
We want to know what happened to you
after you jumped into the water.
We were all so distressed
when we could find no trace of you.
Now, you tell us. Tell us the whole story.
There was a lobster.
First of all, a salmon.
He taught me how to swim.
And we went to find the water babies.
Then we met Terrence, and he took us to...
Terrence was a seahorse.
Then we were captured by the evil forest,
and found the water babies' playground...
I don't know about you,
but I can't understand a word he's saying.
To be honest, Mrs. Kennedy, neither can I,
but there again, he's a Londoner.
Anyway, Claude rescued us.
Tom, I can't help thinking
that those two rascals...
...must have given you
a bit of a clout on the head!
Never mind.
True or not true, it was a good story.
But perhaps it is just a fairy tale,
and only fun and pretense.
Therefore, we mustn't believe a word of it,
even if it's true.
Be that as it may, the important thing is...
The most important thing, dear.
The most important thing...
- Didn't I say that?
- Yes, dear.
The most important thing is that we,
Lady Harriet and I...
...want you to treat this good house,
Harthover Hall, as your home.
Quite so, sir...
...and the invitation is extended
to your friend.
Tom, we shall look after you
as if you were our own son.
So welcome to the family, Thomas...
What's the rest of it, Ellie?
Thomas Aquinas something-or-other.
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Thomas Aquinas something-or-other.
Thomas Aquinas something-or-other.
Sounds as far-fetched as his story.
Boy has a fertile imagination.
Undoubtedly a dream,
but his recall is fascinating.
They don't believe me, Ellie.
They don't believe it really happened.
You don't believe me, Ellie, but it did.
It honestly did.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on, boy!
Yes, he made it up,
but it was really very endearing.
A lobster, dear?
Bonne
Now do you believe, Ellie?
Now do you believe?
I do!
Wait till I tell Uncle John and Aunt Harriet!
It wasn't a story! It was true!
I told you, didn't I?
There are water babies!
There really are!
