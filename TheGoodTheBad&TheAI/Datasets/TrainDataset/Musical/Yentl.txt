- Morning.
-  Good morning.
When I was in Lublin studying last week,
I found this wonderful book.
Can you believe the price of cabbage?
For instance, he gives 25 different
interpretations of Genesis alone.
Best in the market.
Parsnip, turnip, everything for soup!
Storybooks for women,
sacred books for men!
Lovely picture books for women.
. . in each sentence.
Fish, fish! Fishy fish!
Mama!
Rachel!
Fish! Fish!
Come, look. Look at this, ladies.
Fine herring, beautiful silver carp.
-  Delicious.
- See the difference?
The skin should be tight, firm,
and the scales shiny like diamonds.
- Yentl, how's Papa?
- He's much better, thank you.
Then there's the smell.
Lovely picture books for women,
sacred books for men.
Storybooks for women,
sacred books for men.
Yentl? Yentl, what would
you like to have?
Erm...
Yentl, a pike or a carp?
- Fine.
- A nice carp.
Novels for women, sacred books for men.
Yentl, what's this I hear?
You finality got engaged.
- I don't know.
- What? Did you or didn't you?
What, hear about it or do it?
If she can joke about finding a husband
at her age, I should worry.
Here you are.
So beautiful, it'll cook itself.
What's so funny?
- Will you buy my fish?
- I'll eat chicken.
Storybooks for women,
sacred books for men.
Yentl, did you hear about Helen Shipman?
- I haven't got time.
- You never do.
- Buy your gruel.
- Sacred books for men.
Lovely picture books for women.
He relates the mysticism of creation
to the mysticism of language.
We shouldn’t be reading these things.
- Can we afford it?
- No, but there's one in the rabbi's study.
Come on.
What a nice girl! There's your change.
- You're in the wrong place, miss.
- What?
Books for women are over here.
- Novels, very romantic.
- I'd like this one.
- Sacred books are for men.
- Why?
- It's a law.
- Where is it written?
Never mind where. It's a Law.
Well, maybe it's written in here.
Miss, do me a favor. Do yourself a favor.
Ah, here, buy a nice picture book.
- Girls Like picture books.
- What if I told you it's for my father?
Why didn't you say? 15 kopecks.
- And that's written inside the cover.
- Thank you.
Good. And who's wise?
-  He who knows a lot.
- No, try again.
- Who's wise?
-  Erm... he who...
- He who learns from all men.
-  He who Learns from all men?
Good. And who's rich?
Oh, I know that one.
He who is content with what he has.
Yentl, is dinner ready?
Yes, he who has a full heart
and he who is content with what he has.
How can one question
have two answers?
Ah, David, sometimes there are
many answers to the same question.
Now, the last one.
- Who is strong?
- Erm...
- Strong...
- No, no. Who is strong?
- He who controls his passions.
- Concentrate.
Controls his passions!
- Try, David.
- I'm trying.
- He who...
- He who controls his passions!
Yentl knows Talmud?
I think that's enough for today.
My father says that a woman
who studies Talmud is a demon.
She's not a demon, she just has big ears.
So you don't need to tell your father.
- Goodbye, Reb Mendel.
- Goodbye.
Bye, David.
Now the whole village
will be talking about us.
Papa, you shouldn’t smoke.
Do you think the angel of death will be
frightened away by cough medicine?
- First, you don't have to drown him in it.
- Again.
- Second, he's beginning to Like it.
- You want some more?
You know something?
Baked apple is good a little burnt.
- I'm sorry, Papa.
- No. I Like it this way.
- Really?
- Oh, yes.
Go on, your move.
- Papa?
- Mm?
Why does every bookseller
have the same argument?
- You know why.
- I envy them.
- The booksellers?
- No, the students!
Talking about life, the universe.
I learn how to tell a herring from a carp!
Yentl, for the thousandth time,
men and women have different obligations.
- I know, but...
- And don't ask why.
Go on. Get the books.
- Get the books.
- Thank you, Papa.
''Thank you, Papa.
Thank you, Papa. ''
- The shutters, darling.
- The shutters.
If you don't hide my studying from God,
why from the neighbors?
I trust God will understand.
I'm not so sure about the neighbors.
Questions, questions,
even when you were Little.
''Does a goat have a soul?
What was before the universe?''
- I'd Like to know.
- Oy!
- Where were we?
- Hillel's argument. Erm...
Hillel’s argument that knowledge...
Papa?
- Papa?
-
Papa, I'm... I'm a Little tired tonight.
Do you mind? We'll study tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Oh, Yentl, Yentl.
Oy. You're such a comfort to me.
But you should have a young man to take
care of you, one who doesn't Like to eat.
- Good night.
- Good night, Papa.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
God,
O merciful father,
I am wrapped in a robe of light,
clothed in your glory
that spreads its wings over my soul.
May I be worthy.
* Amen *
* There's not a morning I begin
* Without a thousand questions
* Running through my mind
* That I don't try to find
the reason and the logic
* In the world that God designed
* The reason why
* A bird was given wings
* If not to fly
* And praise the sky
* With every song it sings
* What's right or wrong
* Where I belong
* Within the scheme of things... *
* And why have eyes that see
and arms that reach
* Unless you're meant to know
there's something more?
* lf not to hunger
for the meaning of it all
* Then tell me what a soul is for
* Why have the wings
* Unless you're meant to fly?
* And tell me, please, why have a mind
* lf not to question why?
* And tell me where
* Where is it written
what is it I'm meant to be
* That I can't dare
* To have the chance
to pick the fruit of every tree
* Or have my share
* Of every sweet imagined possibility?
* Just tell me where
* Tell me where
* If I were only meant to tend the nest
* Then why does my imagination sail
* Across the mountains and the seas
* Beyond the make-believe
of any fairy tale?
* Why have the thirst
* If not to drink the wine?
* And what a waste
* To have a taste
* Of things that can't be mine
* And tell me where
* Where is it written
what it is I'm meant to be
* That I can't dare
* To find the meanings
in the mornings that I see
* Or have my share
* Of every sweet imagined possibility? *
Papa!
* Just tell me where
* Where is it written?
* Tell me where... *
Are you all right?
* Or if it's written
* Anywhere... *
Did you hear?
Yentl is learning Talmud!
- It's true.
- David's mother told me.
She should Learn how to get a husband.
He came all the way from Riga to see you.
Why won't you at least meet him?
- What for?
- I want to dance at your wedding!
- I want to see you happy.
- I'm happy with you, Papa.
I don't want to get married, to bear children
and darn my husband's socks.
You want a husband who will darn
your socks and bear your children?
Go on, turn the world upside down.
You won't have a moment's peace.
Children are more important
than the Talmud.
Without children to pass it on to, the
Talmud dies with old men when they die.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm the one who's sorry.
You're a woman
but I didn't teach you how to be one.
- You taught me everything I know.
- Too much.
You know too much, but not enough.
- And it's my fault.
- Papa, don't say that.
Learning is my whole Life.
Please don't be sorry. I'm not.
- What is it?
- That tree.
That tree was this high when your brother
Anshel died, may he rest in peace.
You were only a baby, could hardily talk,
let alone ask why.
And now look, look how it's grown.
Too late to tell you to play with dolls, huh?
I love you, Papa.
Hear me, O Lord, master of the universe.
Thou hast given me a daughter
who brings me great pride
and pleasure.
And for this kindness,
I thank thee forever and ever.
What's to become of you, Yentl?
Come, Yentl.
You must tear it over your heart.
- Good.
-  Who will say Kaddish?
- I will.
- It has to be a male relative.
-
-
May God forgive her.
My house is hers as long as she wants.
She'll help in the store,
look after the children, cook...
- Yentl, eat.
-
It's enough.
We mourn for seven days only.
Then Life goes on.
Ah!
Sorry.
Razel, Sarah, I think maybe
we come back later.
Get your things, Yentl.
I'll come back for you Later.
I'll keep you so busy,
you won't have time to think.
Forgive me, Papa.
Wait!
- Wait. Stop!
- Whoa!
-
- What do you want, boy?
Could you give me a ride to the next town?
- You got money?
- Er, a Little.
- Get in back.
- Thank you.
- Yah!
- Where do you think you're going?
-
- Get off of here.
- Go find another wagon.
- Wait! Please wait!
* God
* Our heavenly father
* O God
* And my father, who's also in heaven
* May the Light
* Of this flickering candle
* Illuminate the night
the way your spirit
* Illuminates my soul
* Papa...
* Can you hear me?
* Papa, can you see me?
* Papa, can you find me in the night?
* Papa, are you near me?
* Papa, can you hear me?
* Papa, can you help me
not be frightened?
* Looking at the skies
* I seem to see a million eyes
* Which ones are yours?
* Where are you now that yesterday
has waved goodbye
* And closed its doors?
* The night is so much darker
* The wind is so much colder
* The world I see is so much bigger
* Now that I'm alone
* Papa, please forgive me
* Try to understand me
* Papa, don't you know I had no choice?
* Can you hear me praying
* Anything I'm saying
* Even though the night
is filled with voices?
* I remember everything you taught me
* Every book I've ever read
* Can all the words in all the books
* Help me to face what lies ahead?
* The trees are so much taller
* And I feel so much smaller
* The moon is twice as lonely
* And the stars are half as bright
* Papa, how I Love you
* Papa, how I need you
* Papa, how I miss you
* Kissing me good night *
If I am not for myself, who will be for me?
Who will be for me?
Who will be for me?
If I am for myself alone, who am I?
Who am I?
And if not now...
-
- . . when?
Wait!
-
-  Innkeeper, more soup!
Did you hear that?
Yes. I hear, I hear.
Who's throwing that?
Don't throw that. I told you not to.
- Watch out!
-  Lithuania, Poland, same thing.
A school is a school. It's only the rabbis
that are different. The girls...
- Why would the Talmud repeat itself?
- It's an improper translation.
- Even if they contradict each other?
- Avigdor, what do you think?
The Talmud recognizes
Life is filled with contradiction.
- You see? He agrees.
- Your move.
- Ah!
- What?
- Nothing, sorry.
- No, go on.
It's just that, erm, if you move your castle
- to queen 7...
- Yes?
His knight is pinned. That's all.
You don't know what you're talking about.
No. Sorry.
Stop yelling at me, Papa.
I'm not yelling!
Checkmate.
The Long diagonal. Who knew?
You should’ve listened to him.
Chaim, catch!
- You want a bite?
- No, thank you.
- Don't play.
- Hey, you. You.
- Sit down.
- Why?
Because I said so.
Five kopecks if you win.
Pay me one if you lose.
What do I have to do?
Whoever forces
the other's hand down wins.
- No, thanks.
- Ready? Go!
Wasn't it Rabbi Akiva who said,
''The true strength of a man... ''
One kopeck.
''. . Lies in his ability to stretch
the narrowest mind''? Thank you.
You're welcome.
Now you can stretch my mind again.
Go.
I think Rabbi Akiva also said...
Two kopecks.
- I thought it was one.
- Mm. But I beat you I twice.
Oh.
Give him back his money.
- Why?
- Because I said so.
Because you said so.
I'll see you Later when your beard
starts to grow. Mama's boy.
- No, it wasn't, since you ask.
- Hm?
Rabbi Akiva. ''The narrowest mind. ''
Oh. Er, was it Rabbi Eliezer?
No, Rabbi Israel Salanter.
Rabbi Israel Salanter.
My brother didn't have one either.
What?
- Are you hungry?
- A Little.
- Help yourself.
- Yes, please.
Which yeshiva are you going to?
I haven't decided. Someplace quiet.
A quiet yeshiva?
- Bechev's the best.
-  Well, the nearest.
That's where we study.
Well, I just count the days till I go home.
His parents count
the days until he goes back.
Our rabbi's a genius.
Rabbi Zalman? Maybe you've heard of him.
I think so.
In one answer, he settles ten questions.
Papa had 10 questions for every answer.
Had?
He died eight days ago,
may he rest in peace.
You're in mourning too.
My brother.
Almost a month now. May he rest in peace.
I'm Shimmele, by the way.
- Oh.
-  Hello.
- And you?
- What?
What's your name?
- My name?
- Name.
Um...
Anshel. That's it.
That's my name. My name is Anshel.
Good. You know your own name.
You're as good a scholar as I am.
- This is Avigdor.
- I know.
- I mean, hello.
-  Boys!
Wagons to the north and west leaving now.
And now means now!
Goodbye.
Anshel.
Anshel!
Hey, are you deaf? Anshel!
Anshel. Yes?
There's room if you're still undecided.
I just decided.
* He tells him there's a fisherman
who's got the strongest rod
* The cod he catches are so big
* And when they see
his cod they scream! *
- Where you from, Anshel?
- Erm...
A Little village
you've never heard of. Yanev.
Yanev? I have relatives in Yanev.
A third cousin.
- We moved.
- What?
Years ago.
- You have relatives in Riga?
- Riga?
- No.
- Now we live in Riga.
Oh.
Were you close?
He was my father and teacher.
What more could you ask?
What about your brother?
- We were brothers.
- Older? Younger?
- Younger, about your age.
- What happened?
Pneumonia.
Sorry.
Would you Like to discuss
a page of Talmud?
- Oh, no, not Talmud.
- Which?
- Whatever you're reading.
- I'll state the premise. You dispute it.
- When does day become night?
-  Sundown.
-  When is sundown?
- When you see three stars.
Not precise enough. When's dusk?
- When the light's no longer blue.
- That's twilight.
- Twilight is when objects are silhouettes.
- Be quiet for five minutes!
There's Bechev! We're home!
How do I get into this yeshiva?
Rabbi Zalman tests you on what
you know or what you think you know.
Can I live at this Yeshiva?
No, but you'll find lodgings.
There may be a room where I stay.
I'm starving.
You're always starving.
-  Wait for me!
- You walk too slow.
-  You walk too fast.
- The synagogue's to the left,
the yeshiva's straight ahead,
I live around the corner.
-
- Who is it?
-  It's me.
- Avigdor?
How many other boyfriends do you have?
I'm so glad you're back!
-  Are you all right?
- Yes, yes.
When you see Hadass you’ll feel better.
Who wants other girls when I've got you?
- Shame! A wicked tongue.
- I want you to meet my friend, Anshel.
- Anshel, Mrs Jacobs.
- Good evening.
- Anshel?
- Do you have a room for him?
Oh, I'm sorry, dear, not tonight.
My niece is here,
but she leaves tomorrow.
- All right, he can share my bed.
-  No, I can't.
Why not?
- I don't want to impose.
- Don't be silly.
- I'm a restless sleeper.
- That's all right. I snore.
Come on.
Young.
Anshel, will you put out the lamp?
I can't. I'm being tested
by the rabbi tomorrow.
So? You're going to Learn the entire
Talmud by heart overnight?
All 2, 555 pages?
- You're tired, you sleep.
- I'm exhausted.
I've been in the wagon all day,
all I want to do is sleep.
Get in bed.
- Would you Like to talk a Little?
- Bed.
- Why don't I just...
- Get in bed.
So, er...
- Who's Hadass?
- Hm?
- Mrs Jacobs mentioned...
- For God's sake!
Sorry. It doesn't matter.
Go back to sleep.
The girl I'm engaged to.
Oh.
-
- Sorry.
- Oh, it's your suitcase.
-
Is she, er, pretty, this Hadass?
No.
Beautiful.
What color hair does she have?
I dine at her house every Tuesday.
I'll take you.
Thank you.
- Red.
- Hm. Red, huh?
- Will you get into bed?
- Sure.
You’ll fall off the edge.
I always sleep Like this.
- Why?
- Why?
I... I think it's written.
What is?
Two bachelors in the same bed
must lie back to back.
- Really?
- Really.
So turn over, please.
Why'd you have to talk about Hadass?
Now I'll never get to sleep.
Why not?
Don't you ever think sinful thoughts?
- No.
- No?
- Yes!
- Don't be so nervous.
Why should I be nervous?
You're being tested
by the rabbi tomorrow.
Mm. Mm.
Good night.
Good night.
No, Anshel, the point of study is
to teach us how to Live, not only to study.
- Why?
- Again, ''Why?''
My father quoted Hillel, who said... May I?
- Hillel said, ''May I?''
- No, may I quote Hillel?
Quote, quote.
''He that increases wisdom increases Life. ''
Wisdom is the most important thing.
Only as the means to an end.
Wisdom is the means.
Living is the end.
Then, may I ask you another question?
Ask, ask.
If he that increases study increases
wisdom, and therefore Life, then...
You can't just grab it...
That's not it. You can do it, so Long as...
That's why the rabbi says
you must use the Left side.
Well?
I don't know. He just said to me...
- He asks a Lot of questions.
- Sorry, I've been told that before.
It's by their questions
that we choose our students,
not only by their answers.
Your father taught you well, Anshel.
Welcome to our yeshiva.
I'm accepted?
- I'm a student?
- Mazel tov.
I'm a student.
And now, a study partner for him.
* There are moments
* You remember all your life... *
Mazel tov, Anshel.
* There are moments
you wait for and dream of
* All your life
* This is one of those moments
* I will always remember this chair
* That window
* The way the light streams in... *
He's too advanced for them.
* The clothes I’m wearing
- * The words I’m hearing... *
- Too advanced for Yessel.
- * The face I’m seeing... *
- So who?
* The feeling I’m feeling... *
- Me?
- You?
My chickens are too advanced for you.
Thank you.
- Avigdor?
- *. . will be written in my heart... *
There's only me
who is too advanced for him.
- * As long as I live... *
-  It's up to you.
We’ll see.
* I can travel the past and take what I need
* To see me through the years
* What my father learned
and his father before him
* Will be there for my eyes and ears
* I can walk through the forests
of the trees of knowledge
* And listen to the lesson of the leaves
* I can enter rooms
where there are rooms within rooms
* Wrapped in a shawl that learning weaves
* I remember, Papa
* Everything you've taught me
* What you gave me, Papa
* Look at what it's brought me
* There are certain things
that once you have
* No man can take away
* No wave can wash away
* No wind can blow away
* And now they're about to be mine
* No tide can turn away
* No fire can burn away
* No time can wear away... *
* I can open doors, take from the shelves
* All the books I've longed to hold
* I can ask all the questions,
the whys and the wheres
* As the mysteries of life unfold
* Like a link in a chain
from the past to the future
* Joins me with the children yet to be
* I can now be a part of the ongoing stream
* That has always been
* A part of me
* There are certain things
that once you have
* No man can take away
* No wave can wash away
* No wind can blow away... *
Anshel, come down.
* No fire can burn away
* No time can wear away... *
Where in the Talmud does it say,
''possession is nine tenths of the Law''?
Shimmele.
- Er... Yebamot?
- No.
- No, it's Baba Metzia.
- No!
- It's Baba Kama, page 29a.
- No!
Forgive me. It's Baba Kama, but it's 31b.
- * There are moments... *
- Anshel is right.
*. . you remember all your life
* There are moments
you wait for and dream of
* All your life
* This is one of those moments *
Mm...
Perfect.
Beautiful.
Congratulations, Anshel.
Accepted in a fine yeshiva.
- Your father would be proud.
- I hope so.
- He was a scholar too?
- Yes, yes, he was.
Now his son after him.
May your father rest in peace.
May he rest in peace.
Avigdor's brother too. He told you?
Um, yes, he did.
Consumption, a terrible thing.
Esther!
- At our table, two scholars waiting.
- I'm coming.
I'd Like to have a toast
to the new yeshiva boy.
- Lechaim.
-  Lechaim.
- How was the fish, boys?
- Delicious.
- Hadass made it.
- It's Avigdor's favorite.
I hope so.
We get it every Tuesday!
It's very good. It's good fish.
You have a lovely home, Mrs Vishkower.
Such beautiful things,
the silver, the dishes, the tablecloth.
Thank you, Anshel.
It's nice of you to notice.
Oh! I'm sorry.
It's all right.
You, erm, you come from a big family?
- No.
- No brothers or sisters?
- No.
- Your father never remarried?
- No.
- Esther.
I'm just curious. Who took care of them?
If I knew Talmud the way my wife
knows everybody's business,
I'd be the sage of all sages.
Don't you pay any attention.
* No wonder he loves her
* No wonder at all
* The moment she sees him
* Her thought is to please him... *
Horseradish is good for you.
* Before he even knows that he's hungry
* She's already there with his plate
* Before his glass is even empty
she's filling it up
* God forbid he should wait... *
* Before he has the chance to tell her
he's chilly she'll go put a log on the fire
* Fulfilling his every desire
* No trouble
* No bother... *
- Carrots?
- No, thank you.
* No wonder
* She's pretty
* What else should she be?
* She hasn't a worry
* And why should she worry?
* When she gets up, her biggest decision
* Is figuring out what to wear
* To pick a blouse, a skirt,
and then there's the problem
* Of what should she do with her hair
* And later as she stands
and studies a chicken
* The question's to roast
or to not roast
* Or better yet, maybe a pot roast
* Tomatoes?
* No... *
- Potatoes.
- Mm.
* No wonder
* He likes it
* It's perfect this way
* Who wouldn't want someone
who fusses and flatters
* Who makes you feel
that you're all that matters
* Whose only aim in life is to serve you
* And make you think
she doesn't deserve you?
- * No wonder... *
- It's all right.
- *. . he loves her... *
- It happens.
- * What else could he do? *
- All the time. Ha-ha!
* lf I were a man
* I would too *
-  Let's try dessert.
- Yes, Mother.
Good, hm?
Let's go this way.
- She makes the best almond cakes.
- Mm.
- I thought it was pneumonia.
- Hm?
- Your brother.
- It was.
- Vishkower said consumption.
- Did he?
They were very impressed with you.
''Beautiful dishes, beautiful home. ''
I didn't open my mouth
the first two months except to eat.
Is she always that nervous?
She's a girl...
in Love. What do you expect?
She doesn't say very much.
What does she have to say?
Don't you ever wonder
what she's thinking?
No.
- What could she be thinking?
-
I don't need her to think.
I can do that with you.
Wrong. The Hebrew for rib
never meant rib, it meant side.
Rib, side, what's the difference?
Adam was created male and female.
- Where's that written?
- Genesis, chapter five.
If God took one side of Adam and created
woman, that means we're all the same.
You've never been with a woman.
I mean they share masculine
and feminine qualities.
- Look, can you do that?
- What?
Create Life, give birth to sons?
When you can, then tell me we're the same.
Another interpretation,
the true story of Adam and Eve -
God wouldn’t make her from Adam's ear
Lest she be an eavesdropper.
Nor from his heart, lest she be jealous.
But from a hidden part of the body,
so she be modest.
- In other words, the rib!
- No, no, not the rib!
- Side!
- Rib!
- Side!
- Rib. Admit you're wrong.
- Admit it. Admit it!
- I will not! I'm not wrong!
- Admit it!
- Get off! I can't breathe!
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
Come on.
- Where are you going?
- Come on!
Avigdor, wait!
- Avigdor!
-
- Avigdor, where are you?
- Over here!
- Come on in.
- Oh, my God.
- Come on in!
- No! Er...
There's a passage here that, erm...
- It's the only way to cool off!
- No, it's all right.
I'll, er... I'll watch the clothes.
Don't throw me in the water.
Shimmele, come on in!
-  How's the water?
- It's good. It's fun.
It feels wonderful. Whoo!
- You're really missing something.
- Am I?
-  The water's perfect.
- Is it?
- Here, your pants.
- What a day.
- Put on your pants.
- What a pleasure!
- It must be a sin.
- It couldn’t be.
Anshel! Come on in!
- That's enough studying!
- No, no, it's too cold.
- The water's warm.
- No, I catch cold easily.
That's not the reason.
Why didn't you tell me?
- What?
- You can't swim.
I can't swim. That's right. I can't swim.
I can't swim!
Neither can I.
That's why I stay where it's shallow.
- Come on, I'll teach you.
- No.
- Don't be afraid.
- No! I don't Like swimming!
- Take off your clothes.
- No! Stop it! Please, stop it!
- Are you ashamed? Embarrassed?
- I don't want to!
- All right!
- I don't want to!
All right, all right. If you're that scared...
I'm not going to force you.
- Next time.
- Sure.
When you're ready.
* There's no chill
* And yet I shiver
* There's no flame and yet I burn
* I’m not sure what I’m afraid of
* And yet I’m trembling
* There's no storm, yet I hear thunder
* And I'm breathless, why, I wonder
* Weak one moment
then the next I'm fine
* I feel as if I'm falling
every time I close my eyes
* And flowing through my body
is a river of surprise
* Feelings are awakening
* I hardily recognize as mine
* What are all these new sensations?
* What's the secret they reveal?
* I'm not sure I understand
* But I Like the way I feel
* La la, la la
* Oh, why is it that
every time I close my eyes he's there?
* The water shining on his skin,
the sunlight in his hair
* And all the while I'm thinking things
* That I can never share with him
* I'm a bundle of confusion
* Yet it has a strange appeal
* Did it all begin with him
* And the way he makes me feel?
* I Like the way
* He makes me feel *
Which is the greater crime,
stealing by day or by night?
-  By day.
- By night.
- What's wrong?
- That's what I wanna know.
Every morning, you exhaust
the five books of Moses
and the entire mystery of
the universe. This morning, nothing.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Just Like my brother. In a world of your
own, not speaking your mind, moody.
- Who's moody?
- Worried about something?
- No.
- Studies?
I'm your study partner. Tell me if you are.
With me sitting next to you, why worry?
I know. I'll take you to the matchmaker.
- I'm not going to any matchmaker.
- She’ll give you something nice.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Thank you, Sophie.
Avigdor, please.
My future father-in-Law wants to see me.
- We're going tonight.
- No, now.
- What for?
- Dowry, wedding ceremony...
- the wedding night!
- Why do you keep grabbing me?
What?
You're always grabbing me.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
So? Everything has to have a reason?
The wedding night!
Hello, Sophie. Is Avigdor here?
Erm, he, er...
Excuse me.
What's... what's wrong?
-
- What's the matter?
Anshel, I'm sorry. You're still welcome,
no matter what's happened.
Sophie will get you something to eat.
-
- Where's Avigdor?
Excuse me, Reb Alter, but...
Hadass, sweetheart,
try to understand.
Avigdor.
I just came from...
What happened?
The wedding's off.
Why?
He says I have the evil eye,
says melancholy runs in our blood.
What are you saying?
No man can Let his daughter
marry into a family Like that.
Avigdor, what are you talking about?
- They found out.
- What?
- About my brother.
- What about him?
He didn't die of pneumonia
or consumption.
He committed suicide.
Oh, my God.
So no wedding.
No sons.
What's all this for?
- Did you talk to Hadass?
- What for?
She loves you, she'll still marry you.
- Not if her parents say no.
- If she thinks her parents are wrong...
She's a woman! She can't think for herself.
That's nonsense!
You want a philosophical argument?
I've lost the one girl
that I've ever loved, that I'll ever Love!
You’ll fall in Love again.
No.
Hadass is a nice girl but don't make her
into more than she is.
I'm not.
She was exactly what I wanted.
Please go.
I'm sorry.
Is this really happening, Anshel?
Maybe...
someone else will turn up for you.
Maybe not... quite as pretty,
maybe with brown hair.
I wouldn’t notice her if she did.
Why punish him
for something his brother did?
Anshel, please.
Hadass should be proud to be his wife.
- Anshel.
- Love is all that matters.
No, there are other things.
Don't talk old wives' tales, talk the Law.
I'll talk Life!
What matters is a man's children.
It's his children that your Law exists for,
her children!
That's her only dowry.
And my obligation as a father.
I have one daughter. I want the best for her.
Avigdor is the best.
The best scholar, maybe, the best friend.
But not the best choice.
We want someone from a good family,
someone with no secrets to hide.
Someone Like...
Someone else.
Anshel.
A Little more?
In the middle of the night,
he goes to school.
What did you have for dinner?
What did I have for dinner?
Very Little.
And Hadass?
She's still in Love. What do you expect?
How did she Look?
Not as bad as you do.
You didn't miss anything.
It was Like a madhouse.
The whole family’s going crazy.
What do you mean?
Well, it's just that...
I'm sure Reb Alter... I mean, to save face,
they're going to try to marry her off...
After a broken engagement,
they have to. It's usual.
- Did they mention someone?
- No, no.
- But they were looking at me.
- You?
Can you imagine?
Shows you how desperate they are.
- What's the matter?
- The books.
Avigdor? What's the matter?
That's a sin! What are you doing?
Avigdor, please,
just tell me what's happening.
- The books!
- What?
- What are you doing?
- Where is it?
- What are you Looking for?
- Oh, here it is.
- What's the matter?
- Sit down. Sit.
I...
Anshel, I'm going to make you
the happiest man in the world.
- Yes?
- It is the Law, and it's written.
You Like everything written.
- What's written, Avigdor?
-
It's perfect. We are Like brothers.
If one dies, it is the other's obligation
to marry his widow.
Who's died?
I want you to marry Hadass.
- Oh, no.
- Yes.
Never, Avigdor, I couldn’t.
- Why not?
- Why not?
- She Loves you.
- Let me explain.
I'm not your brother.
- In my eyes, you are!
- I don't want to marry her!
- I don't Love her!
- That's good!
- What are you talking about?
- Listen! It's meant to be!
Nothing's meant to be.
The thought of her with another man,
a total stranger, drives me crazy.
You marrying her would be
the nearest thing to me marrying her.
They may marry her to someone
she doesn't know!
- She could never Love me.
- She likes you.
I could see her, visit you both.
You're talking Like a madman.
If they take her away,
I'll never see her again.
- She’ll take care of you.
- No.
- Wealthy family, beautiful girl...
- No!
- Why do you have to be different?
- Please, that's enough.
Oh! What's the matter with you?
Any other man would...
Anshel, time will go by.
Tempers cool, things change.
Who knows? Perhaps even her father.
Your marriage could be dissolved.
Hadass and I could...
She means that much to you?
Who better will you find?
Who better will she find?
- Do it, for all of us.
- I can't! It's impossible.
Nothing's impossible.
Just think about it.
I've thought.
It's out of the question. The answer is no.
Another question.
Do you feel anything for me?
What?
Do you?
Of course I do.
Then think again.
More noodles? They're your favorite.
How do you know?
You told me Last week at dinner.
- I don't remember.
- I do.
It's a little chilly in here.
I thought it was rather warm myself.
It is warm... for this time of year.
* No wonder she suits him
* She never disputes him... *
Last year, it was also warm.
* The conversation's not too exciting
* But oh, what a change it must be
* To spend an evening
where there's no conversation
- * Must be a relief after me... *
- I'll get dessert.
* And though there's nothing much
to challenge your mind here
* Who cares when the food's so delicious?
* Not to mention these beautiful dishes
* A matched set
* From France yet... *
You Look pensive.
No, I was just thinking.
About me?
As a matter of fact, I was.
Good thoughts, I hope.
Something smells good. What is it?
It must be the cinnamon
in the baked apple.
You bake apples too?
* No wonder he loves her
* No wonder to me... *
- A cushion?
- Why not?
* With ribbons and laces
* In all the right places... *
- Milk or lemon?
- Yes, please.
* I must admit it's all very pleasant
and this is a comfortable room... *
- Which?
- Which what?
* And if he likes the smell
of lilacs and roses
- * Then maybe he likes her perfume... *
- Lemon or milk?
* And though her silky hair
and milky complexion are nice
- * Still they're not that distracting... *
- Anshel?
- Milky.
- What?
Milk, milk!
* So what accounts
for the way he's been acting? *
- Honey?
- * Her softness... *
- No honey.
- * Her sweetness... *
Sugar?
* How could he resist her? *
- An almond cookie?
- * And why would he try? *
How do you get them all the same size?
* No wonder he wants her... *
- You notice everything.
- * He needs her... *
The china. Cookies.
* No wonder... *
That's really wonderful.
* So would I *
Where are your parents?
Maybe they'd Like some tea.
They're in the study
having tea with a guest from Zamosc.
Yesterday, two came from Tomashev.
I must be going.
I may have to leave Bechev
if they don't find someone for me here.
They'll find someone.
Who wouldn’t want you? I mean...
- Don't you think about marriage?
- No, just my studies.
- I admire that in a man.
- That's very good.
Good night.
Good night.
He's not there, Anshel.
He's gone. He took his things and Left.
Hurry!
Wagons to Lublin province leaving now!
Wagons to Lublin province
Leaving now!
Avigdor, don't leave! I was wrong!
- You?
- She's worth fighting for!
- Talk to Vishkower.
- He won't listen!
- Maybe there's a Law.
- There are no laws, not for this.
If you stopped studying once in a while,
you'd know more about Life, about Love.
How can I expect you to understand?
You've never felt it.
Last call for Lublin province!
Avigdor!
- Oh, my God.
- Carry your suitcase, sir?
Bye, Anshel.
I'm sorry about everything.
Asking what I did was
my only way of staying and it was wrong.
No, it's not wrong. It's understandable.
You're in Love.
- It was sinful, unnatural.
- But what's natural?
- I was asking the impossible.
- Don't go, Avigdor!
Everyone aboard!
Don't go!
I'll come with you!
Wait! Avigdor!
Nothing's impossible!
Nothing.
It's impossible.
What do you think, Zelig?
I never had such trouble fitting anybody.
- It's so tight round the chest.
- It fits!
- This is how you cut.
- It's the tape measure.
It's all right.
For Alter Vishkower's son-in-Law,
we must do our best work.
- I Like it this way.
- He Likes it this way! Ha!
- Look at him.
- * Look at me
* I must be absolutely crazy
* How did I ever let it get this far? *
Take off the coat.
* I’m getting deeper into trouble
* Am I a woman or a man?
Am I a devil or a demon?
Problem with the pants. Next to them,
the coat looks good. Take them off.
- Why?
- Why?
* Papa was right
* I ask too many questions
he said a soul can get perplexed
* I can't believe what happens next
Papa was right! *
- Trouble with the crotch.
- What's wrong?
You’ll find out when you relieve yourself.
* It seems this little game I play
becomes more risky every day *
- The pants, please.
- All right, I'll take them off.
- Leave the room.
- He's ashamed.
A tailor is Like a doctor.
What's to be ashamed?
Move, Zelig!
The wedding's tomorrow night!
Move!
Tomorrow night? Tomorrow night?
* Tomorrow night, tomorrow night
* Under the canopy I'll stand with her
tomorrow night
* And place a ring upon her hand
* With her all dressed in white
* Tomorrow night
* I don't know how this came about
but I'll be wed without a doubt
- * I've got to get out! *
-  What did you say?
I've got to get out of my clothes.
Get back out here.
- * Look at this... *
- Come on, move.
* The way one lie begets another
* Somebody wake me up
and say it's all a dream... *
- Ouch!
- Look at this!
* Look how easily I fool them
* They may have eyes but they don't see
they never really look at me
* People are blind
* How else would everyone believe me?
* It might be interesting to know
just how much further I can go... *
Look, the right sieve
is Longer than the Left!
- This will never work.
- We’ll make it work!
At Least the hat fits.
* Tomorrow night, tomorrow night
* I can't believe what I'll presume to be
* Tomorrow night
* I’m not the bride,
but I’m the groom-to-be
* Tomorrow night
* And that's a monumental trick
I'd better think of something quick *
Oh, my God, I'm feeling sick!
Just the usual nerves before the wedding.
- I'd better rest.
- You’ll need plenty of rest!
* I could run away
* I could leave without a trace
* Go anywhere or anyplace
* Where no one knows my face
as a woman or a man
* I don't know, just so I can run away
* Run away
* I’d be free
* I’d be rid of all of this
* But there's someone I would miss
* And being near him is what this
* Is all about
* So running away is out
Will he get away with it?
Will we get away with it?
* Papa, dear
* You dreamed of dancing at my wedding
* But something tells me that I’m right
you wouldn't want to dance tonight *
Take off the clothes.
All right. We’ll Leave the room.
Come, Zelig, we have a Lot of work to do.
* Isn't this
* A strangely logical solution?
* Things may not be as they appear
but the advantages are clear
* He loves her, she loves him
* He Likes me, I Like her
* And I've reason to think she Likes me
* She keeps him, he keeps her
I keep things as they were
* It's a perfect arrangement for three
* Who'd have ever predicted
the moment would come
* When I’d find myself grateful
they've kept women dumb?
* She's an innocent maiden,
but then, so am I
* That's why it's possible
I could get by
* Look, I’ve seen the impossible
happen before
* Maybe, God willing,
it’ll happen once more
* For I feel like a train on a perilous track
* No way to stop, no way to go back
* A snowball that's gathering speed
down a hill
* Going faster and faster and faster until
* Tomorrow night, tomorrow night
* Even if someone would pray for me
* Tomorrow night
* There's not a prayer
that they could say for me
* Tomorrow night
* Tomorrow night, tomorrow night,
tomorrow night
* Is now tonight! *
Mazel tov!
Blessings!
Success! Mazel tov!
Musicians, please!
The mitzvah dance!
The handkerchief dance!
- Excuse me.
-  Where are you going?
Look. Look at the shoulders.
You're not Leaving, are you?
I have a wedding present for both of you.
- Thank you.
- Nachmonides, the holy letter.
He wrote it over 500 years ago.
''Converse with her
to put her mind at ease.
''Speak words which arouse her to Love,
desire, and passion,
''and words of reverence for God. ''
Never force her.
Her mood must be as yours.
Win her with graciousness
and seductiveness.
Be patient until her passion is aroused.
Begin with Love.
And when her mood is ready,
Let her desire be satisfied first.
Her delight is what matters.
-
- Come along.
- Avigdor, I... I don't know if I can...
-  Anshel.
- Anshel.
- Your father-in-law's calling you.
Anshel, I have to talk to you.
Remember your obligation.
As I said, you mustn't be nervous.
Eve was made from Adam's rib
to obey his wishes. So must you.
- There's nothing to be nervous about.
- Yes, Mother.
We have protected her. She knows nothing.
But I don't have to tell you
to be fruitful and multiply.
Thank you, sir, I know the Law.
May your wedding night
be as joyful as ours... was.
And, please God,
a grandson nine months from now.
Are you too warm?
No.
- Shall I open a window?
- No.
Unless you want to. You're the man.
That's true.
- Don't be frightened.
- I'm not.
You're not?
- Yes, I am.
- Good.
- What?
- I mean, it's only natural.
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to. Anything.
But I do. I have to do
whatever you demand.
- No, that's not so.
- It's not?
The Talmud says a woman
may refuse her husband.
- My mother said...
- Too many women don't know the Law!
If you want to refuse
then naturally I respect your wishes.
You're a very considerate man, Anshel.
Only because I know
you're thinking of someone else.
Who? I'm not at all, of anyone.
You mustn't be angry with him.
What?
Well, any woman would be
who was close to him.
You're very understanding.
It's only natural that you wish he were here
instead of me.
But you're my husband.
The thing is, Hadass,
because you're still thinking of Avigdor,
I can't Let you commit any unnecessary sin.
- Sin?
- It's clearly written
that a woman cannot give herself to one
man while she's thinking of another.
Tonight we'll do what you want,
which is nothing, I understand.
- I don't know what I want.
- When you do,
you must Let me know.
You're very hard to resist, Hadass,
but I'm not going to force myself on you.
I'll... I'll just have to be patient.
- Good.
- Good.
Ah! A drop more wine?
It's our secret. No one needs to know.
Our secret.
And our friendship.
- A husband and wife can be friends?
- Oh, yes.
There's only one problem. Help me.
In the morning, when they come in,
they'll think we've...
- But we haven't!
- Shh! Secret!
- Shh!
-
Wait, no, just one bed.
- You silly goose!
-
-
- Ooh!
You tell me.
Truce, truce!
Oh!
Anshel.
I think I'm going to Like
being married to you.
Good night, Hadass.
Good night.
So, er... what was it Like?
- Oh, the usual. Music, dancing...
- I was there.
Oh.
Hadass and I talked, laughed a little...
Laughed a Lot.
And then she went to sleep.
Tell me the truth.
People who want the truth never believe it.
- What did you do to her?
- What do you think I did to her?
You kissed her, caressed her, held her.
All right! I did everything Like you said.
What else do you want to know?
Did she make sounds? Did she scream... ?
- She screamed and went to sleep.
- Went to sleep?
- Anshel.
- She talked a Little.
Talked? In her sleep? What did she say?
Things Like, ''Avigdor, I Love you. ''
''I Love you''?
Go on.
''I adore you, Avigdor, '' she said.
That's the truth?
Yes, my friend.
That's the truth.
Raspberry tea
is very good for headaches.
- Thank you.
- Am I disturbing you?
No.
It's almost sundown, the Sabbath.
Yes.
Mother says it's a special blessing
on the Sabbath.
- Going to synagogue?
- Going to bed.
Mm.
- Unless you're tired.
- What?
Drink your tea. It's getting cold.
When Avigdor used to call,
I sometimes spilled things.
- I don't know if you ever noticed.
- No, never.
It's because he made me tremble, inside.
That's Love, Hadass.
But you don't make me tremble.
You make me peaceful.
That's the friendship
I was telling you about.
- In the Talmud...
- So will you teach me?
Teach you?
Please?
- Talmud?
- Talmud?
- Talmud!
- Not the Talmud.
Talmud! It's the Least a husband can do
for his wife, the most maybe.
I could never Learn Talmud.
Nonsense! Lock the door.
- Isn't it a sin?
- It's not a sin.
Then why are we closing the curtains
and locking the door?
God will understand.
I'm not so sure about the neighbors.
-
- What's funny?
You. I've never seen you so excited.
Now pay attention, Hadass.
First there's the Bible,
- the five books of Moses...
- Wait.
- Where are you going?
- The soup's on the stove...
Let your mother do it, please!
The Talmud is commentaries
interpreting the...
- What are you doing?
- Just pulling a thread...
- Don't! We're studying!
- Yes, Anshel.
- Where was I?
- Commentaries interpreting the Bible.
Yes.
The first commentary is the Mishna,
our code of Law.
I'm glad your headache's better.
It's a masterpiece of literature, folklore,
and philosophy,
it deals with astronomy,
architecture, medicine.
Everything from making Love
to planting Egyptian beans.
Making Love?
To planting Egyptian beans.
I thought you said something about
making Love.
Then there's the midrash -
legends, stories, dealing with legal issues.
Two men dispute
the ownership of a flock of chickens...
While your books argue about chickens,
I've had to pluck them.
It's Friday. I've been up since dawn.
I'm too tired to be
a scholar on Fridays, Anshel.
I'm sorry.
I'm the one who's sorry, Hadass.
I'm too tired
for the special Sabbath blessing,
even if maybe you were
going to... demand it...
Maybe.
Next Tuesday, eight o’clock.
What about her parents?
I'll just say, ''Avigdor's coming to dinner. ''
Anyway, they're away next Tuesday.
Are you two agreeing or disagreeing?
- Agreeing.
- Disagreeing.
- Disagreeing.
- Agreeing.
-  He's one second late.
- Hm?
Oh... yes.
- Hello, Sophie.
- I'll take your hat.
Thank you, Sophie.
Hello.
This is the one I brought from home.
The first part's about the ancient mystics.
It's all a bit elementary, but...
Welcome, Avigdor.
-  Tell me more.
- I've told you everything.
It was a very interesting
discussion.
And then what happened?
Well, erm... Avigdor was there too.
He'll tell you.
Was Rabbi Zalman angry or did he laugh?
He... he laughed. Didn't he, Avigdor?
- Yes.
- Did you laugh?
We both did.
I can just see you.
- I'll do that.
- No.
But you have a guest.
So have you.
Marriage agrees with you.
- You're more beautiful than ever.
- Thank you.
Avigdor, I'm concerned about Anshel.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't think Anshel is happy.
Why don't we have tea in the parlor?
Milk or, er... Lemon?
Fine.
Ah!
Sorry.
We Left off with Maimonides' code
of the golden rule.
Let's read chapters seven and eight
and then discuss them. Is that all right?
- All right.
-
Don't stop, Hadass. It's pretty.
* Look at how he looks at her
* Will someone ever look at me that way?
* Full of all the feelings
* And the soft unspoken words
that lovers say
* I thought that I knew every single look
* And sweet expression on his face
* Yet this is one that I don't recognize
* Although I’ve sat
and studied him for hours
* But now I see how love
completely occupies
* A pair of eyes
* See the way they gaze at her
* Like slaves they follow
everywhere she goes
* Do my eyes forget themselves
* And do I ever look at him
* And smile in such a way
* That what I’m feeling shows?
* Sometimes I have the feeling
* Everybody knows
* And even though it's crazy
* Still I can't help wondering
if I'll ever live to see that day
* When by some
* Miracle of miracles
* He'll turn around and look at me
* That way... *
It's no good. I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Avigdor.
Avigdor, wait!
Good night.
Anshel.
Hm?
How many children do you want?
The actual number?
I don't think I've ever really...
He didn't make me tremble tonight.
Hm?
You did, though.
What's even nicer, I made you tremble.
What?
When he was Leaving,
I put my hand on yours.
You were trembling.
Er, well... What are you doing, Hadass?
- I'm Looking at you.
- I can't read without my glasses.
When you told me I could refuse you,
you didn't tell me I also could demand you.
Who told you that?
The Talmud. I forget what page.
- 63a and b.
- It's written, Anshel.
You've been studying too hard.
You said to tell you
when I knew what I wanted.
I do.
It isn't Avigdor. It's no Longer a sin.
- H-Hadass, I...
- Shh.
It's been terrible for you, I know,
all this waiting.
But it's all right now.
You don't have to wait any Longer.
Oh, God! Oh, God! I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry, Hadass.
- For what?
For teaching me? For understanding me?
For making me fall in Love with you?
I can't! I can't!
I feel so certain that you Love me.
Everything you do
shows me you Love me.
What is it, Anshel?
* Look at how she looks at me
* But I can never look at her that way... *
Is it me? Am I so... ?
- Do you find me... ?
- I find you beautiful, beautiful.
Then what?
* Full of all the feelings
* And the soft unspoken words
that lovers say... *
There are things I wish I could explain,
things I'd Like to tell you.
I feel so...
- Maybe you’ll feel better tomorrow.
- I hope so.
* In all the words in all the books
* I wish there were a way to say
* What she's taught me
isn't written anywhere
* And I’m supposed to be
the one who's wise
* One thing is certain
* I can never be what she
* Expects of me
* I've wanted the shadows
* I don't any more
* No matter what happens
* I won't any more
* I've run from the sunlight
* Afraid it saw too much
* The moon had the one Light
* I bathed in
* I waked in
* I held in my feelings
* And closed every door
* No matter what happens
* I can't any more
* There's someone who must hear
* The words I've never spoken
* Tonight if he were here
* My silence would be broken
* I need him to touch me
* To know the Love that's in my heart
* The same heart that tells me
* To see myself
* To free myself
* To be myself at Last
* For too many mornings
* The curtains were drawn
* It's time they were opened
* To welcome the dawn
* A voice deep inside's getting stronger
* I can't keep it quiet any Longer
* No matter what happens
* It can't be the same any more
* I promise
* It won't be
* The same
* Any more *
I'll miss you.
You’ll have lots to do while I'm gone.
- I know, but...
- Tell your parents I'm sorry.
Sorry?
That I wasn't here when they got home.
You’ll see them on Friday.
You can tell us about the city.
Show them the books you bought.
Oh...
I baked almond cakes.
You and Avigdor wouldn’t Last three days
without my almond cakes.
Thank you.
Hurry home.
It won't be the same here without you.
Hadass.
Do you remember
what we studied Last week
in the Talmud about patience?
Tell me, what did we read?
''Patience yields many good things. ''
If you have patience,
you’ll have everything you want.
Children, beautiful children,
as many as you want.
Trust me.
I do trust you.
Well, I... have to be going.
I'll study while you're away.
I want you to be proud of me.
Oh, I am proud of you.
You should be proud of yourself.
I Love you, Anshel.
I Love you too.
* She's mother
* She's sister
* She's lover
* She's the wonder of wonders
* No man can deny
* So why would he change her?
* She's loving, she's tender
* She's woman
* So am I *
This trip was a good idea, Anshel.
- I have a secret to tell you.
- Tell me.
- Not now.
- All right.
So my crazy plan
was crazy after all.
What?
She Loves you now.
- She only thinks she does.
- What?
Things aren't always what they seem.
What are you talking about?
You’ll see.
Now, what's this secret of yours?
I'll tell you when we get to Lublin.
Look, there's our friend again.
I wonder if it ever gets tired?
- When are you going to tell me?
- Not yet.
- Why not?
- I just can't.
Slivovitz?
No, thanks.
So let's hear the secret of yours.
Maybe I will have a glass.
Good. You look a little pale.
- Lechaim.
- Lechaim.
So tell me.
Well, er...
We're friends. What can't you tell me?
All right.
Avigdor, what would you do
if all you wanted in Life was to study
and it was forbidden?
- It isn't forbidden.
- What if it were?
What would you do if some crazy Law
said all men called Avigdor
or all men with brown eyes
were forbidden to study?
- I'd study anyway.
- Secretly?
If I had to. Why?
And that would be difficult,
always hiding, afraid?
Yes. What's your secret?
Without studying, you couldn’t Live.
Is that right?
- That's right.
- I couldn’t, either.
- So?
- So I studied, secretly.
No, you didn't.
What are you babbling about?
Avigdor...
my name isn't Anshel.
That's your secret?
Dear Avigdor.
- I don't know how to tell you this.
- Well, don't. I'll guess.
- I'm not a yeshiva boy.
- You're the chief rabbi of Lithuania.
- I'm not any kind of boy.
- Not the chief rabbi, all right.
My name isn't Anshel.
It's... it's Yentl.
Yentl?
And...
I'm a woman.
A woman.
A woman.
Now my secret.
- I'm the Tsar of Russia.
- Then I'll prove it.
- Stop this, Anshel.
- I'm not Anshel. I'm Yentl.
- I'm not a man. I'm a woman.
- Stop it.
- I'm a woman, Avigdor.
- Anshel, I don't Like this.
What kind of a game is this?
It's not a game.
Not any more.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh, my God.
I've only shown you
so you can testify to the rabbis.
It can't be.
It is.
What have you done?
- Listen to me.
- Don't come near me.
- Let me explain.
- Don't touch me.
Avigdor, don't be afraid,
I'm not going to hurt you.
- You're a monster.
- No.
All I ever wanted to do was study.
''A woman shall not wear
that which pertained to a man. ''
- You're a devil.
- Try to understand...
- Enough! Please!
- I'm not a devil.
Every commandment broken, every day!
Stay away from me! Please!
What are you, a demon?
- I'm not.
- You spit on the Torah!
I Love the Torah!
You spit on it, on everything and everyone.
In God's face, my face, Hadass's face!
- God, Hadass!
- She knows nothing!
- Nothing?
- No, she's never...
An innocent married to a devil!
You married a woman!
- How could you do that?
- It was your idea!
- This? My doing?
- Yes!
Come on, you're a man. Answer me
Like a man. I want to know why. Why?
Why didn't you say you were a woman?
I was afraid of this, of exactly this!
So you lied to me, you lied to Hadass!
I told you things I wouldn’t tell a wife!
- I'm glad you told me.
- What kind of creature are you?
- Just a woman.
- I want the answer.
Tell me the answer. Why? Why?
- I... I was afraid.
- Why?
- I wanted to be near you.
- Why?
I didn't wanna Lose you. I Loved you.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
I Loved you.
I thought you didn't
understand about Love.
No wonder.
My God, no wonder.
All the times I looked at you and touched
you and I couldn’t understand why.
I thought something was wrong with me.
There was nothing wrong with you.
It was me.
Your skin.
It's so...
Your hair...
It must have been beautiful.
It’ll grow.
Your hands...
I always tried to hide them.
Oh, no.
I did... I...
I didn't want to touch you.
I was afraid to.
Your mouth...
Yentl.
I Loved you too.
Hadass.
It's not...
difficult.
I'll write a statement to the rabbis
that the marriage was never consummated.
You can take it back to Beshev,
give it to the rabbis.
The rabbis witnessed it.
Witnessed what, a marriage between
two women? It's null and void.
According to divorce procedures...
No, according to God,
it was not a marriage.
This is crazy.
I'm arguing Talmud with a woman.
It's not the first time.
Go back to her, Avigdor.
I don't think Hadass will Listen
to her parents any more.
Maybe there's something we can do,
a Law or something...
Avigdor, there's no book with this in it.
Sometimes... right can come from wrong,
virtue from sin.
It's in the Talmud somewhere.
We’ll go to another town.
We’ll get married, have children.
We’ll find a new yeshiva.
For both of us?
You still want to study?
We've argued the Bible back to Genesis,
chapter one, verse one.
How could you still ask me that question?
You don't need to any more.
I'll do the thinking, I'll handle everything.
I want to study with you, not darn socks.
- Impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.
You can study at home.
No one has to know.
And draw the curtains,
close the shutters?
- I want you to be a real woman.
- I am.
Then act Like one!
There's no gift from God
more beautiful and miraculous.
You know everything
without opening books.
What more do you want?
More.
Your beard.
I suppose it’ll never grow in now.
How could I have been so blind?
Here's a statement for the rabbi
and a note for Hadass.
Would you give it to her for me, please?
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you too, Avigdor.
Goodbye, Anshel.
Yentl.
Yentl.
* There are moments
* You remember all your Life
* There are moments you know
* Will be with you all your Life
* His face
* Will be written on my mind
* Will be written in my heart
* As Long as I Live *
My dear Avigdor.
After many months,
your letter finally reached me.
I hope this one finds you!
Since we said goodbye,
I’ve prayed that,
despite the pain I’ve caused,
some happiness would come out of it.
And now you tell me it has.
As for me, I’m going to a new place
where I hear things are different.
Anyway, we'll see.
Take care of yourself, and Hadass.
l hope she continues with her studies.
She has great promise.
And remember,
l will love you both, always.
* Tell me where
* Where is it written
what it is I’m meant to be?
* That I can't dare?
* It all began
* The day I found
* That from my window
I could only see a piece of sky
* I stepped outside
* And looked around
* I never dreamed it was so wide
* Or even half as high
* The time had come
* Papa, can you hear me?
* To try my wings
* Papa, are you near me?
* And even though
it seemed at any moment
* I could fall
* I felt the most...
* Papa, can you see me?
*. . amazing things
Can you understand me?
* The things you can't imagine
* If you've never flown at all
* Though it's safer to stay on the ground
* Sometimes where danger Lies
* There the sweetest of pleasures
are found
* No matter where I go
* There'll be memories
that tug at my sieve
* But there will also be
* More to question, yet more to believe
* Oh, tell me where
* Where is the someone
who will turn to look at me?
* And want to share
* My every sweet imagined possibility?
* The more I live
* The more I Learn
* The more I Learn, the more I realize
* The less I know
* Each step I take
* Papa, I've a voice now
* Each page I turn
* Papa, I've a choice now
* Each mile I travel only means
* The more I have to go
* What's wrong with wanting more?
* If you can fly, then soar
* With all there is
* Why settle for...
* Just a piece of sky?
* Papa, I can hear you
* Papa, I can see you
* Papa, I can feel you
* Papa
* Watch me
* Fly *
