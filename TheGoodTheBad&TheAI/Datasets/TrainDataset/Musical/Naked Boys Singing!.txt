"NAKED BOYS SINGING '
TOTAL NUDITY
Here
You use the ticket
Here
Our dance group is a success
Ultimately
Get ready, let's sing
Ultimately
The few who dare to show
Do not be ashamed
To confess
You came to look at
The coolest part
Our frontal nudity...
Here
For us all it's magic number
Here
There is also space for comic and tragic
For us?
There is no guilt or punishment has
For us?
Bare stage is the definition
But we do want, arguing
You'll like it
Oh, go...
When natural
This is our full nudity
Mom always wanted me to be the largest
Always gave me all the good and best
If you saw me today so
As a dummy
What would the years of classical and jazz
And six years of ballet?
Well ..
I will not forget everything I learned
But as is so good, Mom, get naked here!
You shuffle your look with lustful
Because without the towel private is public
Jerry... Sorry...
Sorry!
Cellular... I knew...
phone!
Let me answer for you...
Hello?
Not here Ps is the
Who speaks?
Sal's mother ..
He can now talk now.
He will already be naked!
You've heard the warning before the show?
No, sorry!
Well, what was told is that
if your phone rings during the presentation,
you should get naked with us.
So... Let...
Sorry, we reinstate your Ps
phone, now you are part of the show.
So you can dance and sing?
For we can call another person.
Alright! Who wants to see
Sal singing and dancing naked?
Now, when the count of 3 will start
the first presentation of Salt nuzinho.
Ready?
Salt Ready?
A. .. Two...
Three!
Well, where were we?
You shuffle your look with lustful
Because without the towel private is public
You can be gay, straight or bi
There is only one reason for coming here
In front, behind
In the four cardinal points
Let us proclaim
Thus the natural
Like any mortal
The coolest part
I get so exposed
What remains to show?
The doors closed
There is nothing to hide
I took off my armor
I looked closely
And I saw that being naked is more
Only to be discovered
Then I realized
That nudity is more than an order
So, I know I want to undress me
Of shame in me.
The truth I'll get
Not knowing where I'm going
I look at my body
And try to see who I am
Anyway, the drama is not our motto
Here is how the summer of Ipanema
Here there is no Shakespeare or Moliere has
Critics write what she wants
I hear you moan
It is sensational
Thus the natural
Like any mortal
The coolest part
Our... Our... Our...
Our full nudity
Total!
MY PROFESSION
I told an acquaintance
I wanted to work
And then he asked me
if i was exemplary
In the house in order by
they work very nice
I would think...
But with an unusual requirement
Scrub the floor naked
Vacuuming then
Upturned butt
Rinse with force clothing boss
Muscles in shape
Here is my standard
Is the house shine like the Taj Mahal
That being so nice
Without clothes, and the attention to me
It is an endless fun
And I get a lot of money
I like more
of my profession
Earlier rolls a climate
And it just gets better
If the mood is up there
Laughing says he is a fan of Belchior
Go undressing
That saves you time
By joining the material to use
Cloth, bucket, mop
And he's already feeling burning
I have sex only if it is
A cat... and my card
Says what the obligations
my profession
League!
You seem strass!
Following me like a cat
I let him look more
Singing and clean your picture
I use my natural gifts
And in any case
It's kinda scary
It seems a performance,
but with a mop
Already four in readiness
Clean every crack or go
I feel a satisfaction
And I can not stop
The welfare and it is my
in my profession
I charge extra for dance...
But I give a discount if the ruffles...
The neighbors love
when I clean the windows.
Smell of jasmine
I gave it my all
My power is awesome,
Finally!
Until I retire
work with dedication
I give myself with passion
to my profession
But...
To finish the story
I will not claim victory
Because I do not really mind
for the gift of tidiness
Well, pay attention
And it will give me reason
With all my heart
I make a confession
But that contradiction
My home is... just a mess!
What a mess!
HOOD TO SEDUCE
At eight days the family has wanted to see me
Came a man who had something
that glowed in his hand
He then said:
"Blessed is the fruit that was born"
He spoke in a language beyond all understanding
"Baruchatah... I do not know that there "
Everyone then realized it was there
Instrument worthy of wonder
Someone said: "Other"
Clinked crystals
As if I had something unique
"Da da di di di di di di"
The hood that seduces
Everyone gathers around my penis
To look at, contemplate
This organ is in the service of Venus
They will smile, applaud
Everyone cheered as this masterpiece
That eagerness, a Rodin
When up is sublime, is a sideshow
Taking measures is so great
Hung Up is wonderful
A thousand cheers is jus
Hood that seduces
"Mazel Tov"
I assumed that the tin-tin for me
would never-ending
A cut tight
beard and saying:
"Do not ever expose"
I will show, a feast
And while looking you will find a treat
Dying for pleasure
As the language into a pot of dulce de leche
Divine, delicious,
perfect, glorious
Splendid, lofty,
but it is dangerous
Causes no harm to use straight
Do not you dare cut
more speck
Scared me bend
Makes me that I cut
Very important
Nothing sharp
Neither far nor near
But be smart
Spotlight
Oh how I miss my
Hood that seduces
IN THE SAME WINDOW
There you are
In the window in front
I want to see if you look at me
And I'm here
In the window in front
To play the game that never end
Just look at each other find
And come the temptation to look more
Then your eye is my
and overcoming shyness
In the silence I can see
You match
We once again
Blind desire
Will tonight
you gonna call me?
And if you want
Can I be your comfort
And if you want
My wishes can reveal
Hold you in your eyes and see me
Making love until dawn
And once again
Caught in my eye
The same image comes to me cause
And before the nudity
Try again
Find a way to get closer
This meeting which takes place in the same window
Take me, come flooding
Music and heat my days always cold
In me, you will find
And if you want
Can I be your refuge
And if you want
Today I can give myself
Hold you in your eyes and see me
Making love til dawn...
I read in your eyes
You want me too
I want you...
I want you...
I want you...
But if you want
I offer my care
If you want,
I'm by your side
Hug
in your eyes and see me
Do not stop the game here
Do not go away soon
I need you
Say yes
I want to find
Come get me
So until tomorrow
On another evening
GOING UP!
No. .. Oh, no
Not really
Think of the smell of sweat
In girls ugly
In his parents making love
Yuck!
No. .. What a terrible situation
I can not contain
A. .. Only one
Just a minute
Just get up in the closet
Just pick up the towel
And I could cover
Ouch... Just... It is a natural defect
What clubs can not think
Ar .. More air
Breathe!
Pretending to be alone in complete calm
If I try, I can
More... Ar .. Hard evidence
will prove that I'm gay
Eye to the boys of bodybuilding
- The Football
- From swimming
Torture, suffering, destruction
I can not do more and too much effort
Can not ever control my horny
I hide with hand
Going up!
- No. ..
- Oh
- Air
Going up
- The smell of sweat
- Contain Me
- I'm just
Body and mind, concentration
I know that these bodies give dappled frisson
But pointing fingers is not so good
Going up!
Stop! Yes, stop
Do not think...
- For the more I think
- More he looms
And you can betray me
God!
Stop!
And he never obeys me
Always be controlled
Mother Nature can ruin me.
- Or do I take
- How humiliating!
And which of us will win?
I own me,
I will not call attention.
Look now at the ground
You are the slave and I am the Lord.
Please...
It's embarrassing...
Traitor...
That healed, that tabby, so good, that torture
Doom, my God!
Three... Two... Ummmmm
No, no, no, no, no, no
No! Going up!
No. .. Just...
Ar .. Stop...
No. .. Just...
Ar .. Stop...
Going up
- Collect.
- Viadinho.
- What a shame.
Behave or go out
If this happens, it may be my end
They can not know
what's inside of me
- I feel alone
- I feel alone
- I feel alone
USING ONLY THIS SONG
Dear Aunt Ruby gave us a magazine G.
Can not believe you
was to expose himself this way.
As I stare at people
this city now?
Where was your head?
Hey Chris. Why do not you tell me that
would ruin his career
not to mention mine?
I'm your agent, we gotta talk.
Wait, I'll answer the call...
Marilyn Monroe came out in Playboy
And a calendar
Landed without clothes
Everyone wondered
Mom called her a slut...
But she has sold millions of magazines
and tripled his fortune.
She was rude and a bit naive.
And when asked:
"Honey what were you wearing?"
Believe me, she replied:
"I was just using that song
Nothing, just that song
I do not believe,
What do you too?
And believe me
this is a beautiful song...
Using only this song.
The young Burt Reynolds
also proved.
In Cosmo,
everybody saw it.
On a bearskin rug
and a smile.
Hand over the treasure.
He had good taste
And three decades later
My mother is still amazed!
But when it no longer a novelty
embarrassed in my city...
Burt became the number one...
And he used only this song...
Just used this song...
Now tell me,
What's wrong?
And believe me
this is a beautiful song...
Using only this song.
Only a few dreams
And with a pleasing personality
Even though ambitious, I'm shy.
But know that even liked...
With flashes on me.
And with the clicks of cameras...
I felt like a star
And I was only using this song.
Using only this song...
Using only this song...
Now tell me,
What's wrong?
And from now on
will always play my song
Yes!
Using only this song...
I'm fine.
And much better than the rest.
Using only this song...
Using only this song...
Using only this song...
SONG OF PILA
When problems persist in this life tormenting me
When the subjects most petty harass me endlessly
My torment and despair ultimately end up
Well... I seek relief
is in my own hand
I'll punch
I'll punch
Banging his hand on my pylon
I'll never tiring kneading
What a feeling
Grind grain
I'll crushing, grinding
Punch up running out of air
To relax
I'll punch
No need to study
nor erudition
Everything comes naturally
only with concentrations
No need for partner
uniform or pectoral
Get ready, we will...
... Demonstrate how it's done!
I'll punch
I'll punch
Hitting the hand
In my pylon
I'll never tiring kneading...
What a feeling
Grind grain
I'll crushing, pressing
Punch up running out of air
To relax... To relax... To relax
I'll punch
We forgive the arrogance
Our sport is what is preferred
It's good and not opposed to the terms of decency
Garlic without punch
causes flatulence
I'll...
I'll punch
I'll punch
Banging his hand on my pylon
I will knead without tiring.
I'll punch
I'll punch
I'll tell you
You see it to believe it, I punch up running out of air.
With what pleasure
I will temper
After grinding
And then prove
Leave tan, wet
Then serve and eat
In my mortar... In my mortar...
In my mortar... In my mortar...
In my mortar... I'll punch
I'll punch!
Robert Mitchum
There must be something wrong with me.
Cause I do not think even a little sexy.
Guys with perfect bodies.
If showing how
Hollywood gods.
What I've been everywhere
In every movie, every book
I see. I see. I see.
Mountains and mountains of muscles
That just my horny.
For me,
I love the days of Robert Mitchum.
I know he was chubby and flabby.
But when she got naked.
Simply enchanted me...
For me,
I remember the times when
men were no more
so much time working out
When a potbelly
was good to hug
Oh my God,
Bring me the Robert Mitchum.
I do not mean that
I am immune to the charms
a defined chest
and muscular arm.
But a failure here
a defeitinhos there
steal my look soon.
I know I'll never be healed
But to say that my heart is big.
True, true! Oh my God!
At that time I would also be sexy.
Before the era of the implants
and liposuction.
For me,
I love the days of Robert Mitchum.
Despite his smoking
and other things
But when they played the tough guy
Gave me the biggest boner.
For me,
I remember the times when the guys
... Drinking lots of water and not beer,
Or discuss the consistency of your skin.
That's where I sear...
I really want is Robert Mitchum.
Do not you remember him?
He did Cape Fear?
That was not just a movie,
was something extraordinary for me
He was sexually and
murderously serious.
Tough and lightly dressed.
I'll never forget
The close in his eyes that gave
He knew exactly what to do.
A perfect tan
In the era of real men.
As Robert Mitchum.
And I'm not alone...
For us,
We want the days of Robert Mitchum.
When the guys came
in all shapes and sizes.
And some even managed a couple.
And as played out conversation...
For us, we remember the times when
that men were not so young
Or tall or skinny or healed.
To be honest,
exagerandamente perfect.
A perfect tan
In the era of real men.
As Robert Mitchum...

PORN ACTOR
You know?
I am a porn actor from the interior of Parana
Mom does not like me go to work
In my profession
Sex is my bread and butter
But dad says
I'm gonna burn in hell.
I was once an altar boy,
frustrated but my godmother
Since the day he showed up naked
The neighbors commented,
aunts fainted
When I chose this profession.
Inside is already known
Sex is forbidden topic
Speaking of his own penis is taboo
While the scroll wheel
I stare up solace
And to show the world my turkey...
I am a porn actor from the interior of Parana
And much say-that-says-I heard
Envy me, believe me
Business with pleasure
And live the way I dreamed.
But... If I say I never tire
Never to drown the goose
For the cameras
With more than once
I've been called a sinner,
dirty, down, shamelessly.
I do not care or
the minimum processions
If the plan is tightly closed,
by train to roast chicken
The people already starting to attack me
I did not pay attention,
going from four to the floor...
Concentrate sphincter relaxation pro...
I am a porn actor from the interior of Parana.
My jet is so powerful nor so
But if the money is legal,
show the snake with sticks and bush
Buy clothes, car, house and garden.
See...
I know that my success
is something that I deserve
I am an exemplary employee
The versatility
I only bring prosperity
In both positions I can play...
If I sometimes feel guilty,
a gorgeous body is the excuse
To moan, pant,
grunting, calling for more...
And the movie go running
I set and taking advantage
A pleasure to gargantuan proportions!
I am a porn actor from the interior of Parana
Can rent all my movies
My heritage is that there,
Oiapoque to Chuy's
I appear on TV nonstop.
My work is unusual,
I do not judge anyone
I pride myself that I embraced this life
Only because of my home
I decided to rebel
I love
My success
Soon you will see
My butt-size will sell
Abundance that my butt,
knockout any mortal
My rear will turn
national headlines:
"A great actor porn inside...
From there do Parana
The interior of Parana,
I was born in Maringa... Hi!
KRIS, SEE WHAT HE LOST
Helpless and so alone
Lacking and directionless
I got angry, got lost
I loved you with fever
What a laugh
That freshness
I wanted to live
With strength
With fury
My great love
Weak, me
And I was weaker
Cris, how I wanted
I remember it well
I can no longer hold
Those who were
I try to forget
Work
Future
I follow
Empty
Alone
Survived
Weak, I was
And left me weaker
Cris, I always wanted...
Images
I imagine you still here
Life goes on
What steps do I take?
Memory
Nostalgia
Memories too
Still
Bound
You and I
But if I look good
Every time I see more
Cris, so I wanted!
They are all well
The world is moving
There is war and peace
Life takes me
I feel good
Today I am stronger
Remembering you
Cris...
I try to look
For things that make me well
With my friends
I feel happy.
I dream
I laugh
The winter is over
Your face
Warm me
Eternal Summer
Cris, how much I wanted
Oh, Cris...
Oh, Cris...
Oh, Cris...
It made me so happy...
BELO BOFE WELL PUMP
It is six o'clock
Sunrise
My god, what sleep tremendous
Everyone in a good mood
Except me
That punishment is to have a tire
My eye says: No!
The mouth says: No!
The mind says No!
But he says:
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
To be a great breeder and pumped
It's good to get a heavier weight
To be a great breeder and pumped
It's good to get an ever increasing...
Sweating profusely
My body hurts
Maldita series
What destroys me
I look in the mirror and feel good
But seeing the Barbie I'm a nobody
I look high and I think: "Who am I?"
What misfortune is to have a tire
Biceps: No!
Triceps: No!
Abdomen: No!
But he says:
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
To be a great breeder and pumped
It's good to get a heavier weight
To be a great breeder and pumped...
It's good to get a weight each
greater!
Run the treadmill
I'm breathless
I can not get
Nowhere
My feet burned, twisted, hurt
That martyrdom is to have a tire
Thighs: No!
The glutes, No!
Heart: No!
We know that this is torture
Barbies never eat fried food.
Just
Good!
Since the shower
I'll slowly undressing
That nervous
Wrapped in a towel.
So I go into the steam
I notice the looks around me
Groping try to see
Hungry,
many eyes try to eat me...
Heat
And sweat
The bodies are incessantly
I feel there is tension in the air.
Steam...
Numbness...
Heat...
My skin says: Oh!
My hand says: Oh!
My tongue says: Oh!
And he says: Hi!
Hi!
Hi ..
Later?
Of course, later!
Juliet has not only Romeos
Flee now the sauna
More air, my God!
If the angels of heaven are too muscular
The sky is... the sky is... is...
Hotter than hell. Amen
You may think I'm delirious
But it is only because I'm working out
If your goal is to increase
It does not matter which head will lead
Who cares if the low win?
It alone warrants my pleasure
Cursed is the time to raise
But I know the reason I work out...
For he says:
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah!
THE ARTIST
You see me here
Do not know how many lives can I live
Do not know who I am
And what does this mirror you see?
I surrender to my role
I am faithful to the stage
Here it is: "To be or not"
Corner then
A good verse
I dance well
Do not miss the tone
You just
Breathless...
How sublime to see someone
represent...
But I lied
I pretend well
Right now I'm thinking:
"God, that bag is fake"
But for you
I can be
a great artist
Betty Midler is divine
And Barbra Streisand is emotion?
They feel hunger, boredom, anger
or sleep and lose track
With faith insist...
How do I resist
They are always artists
We know well
It tastes
Being an artist.
If I bare what's left to see?
Only an outline of what I can do
E class and rehearsal and singing
and dancing to satisfy you
But if the bottom of my wardrobe
you spy
Will notice that I sweat, get tired, I tremble,
cough and lose the air... air... air
Ooooh!
Air!
Jerry...
Thanks!
Air!
I know how to lie
But I will follow
Backstage at the mirror crying
And think of escape
It always does
Good and bad
This is be...
... Artist...
Here shine
Back then delete
Just being an artist
Come on, guys!
If I bare what's left to see?
Only an outline of what I can do
E class and rehearsal and singing and dancing to satisfy you
But if you under my costume spy
You will see that I have foot pain
Ingrown toenails, calluses and foot odor
Cramps, gas and indigestion
Laryngitis, bronchitis, hoarseness and also
Bloated, nauseated, it'll throw up
Tired, numb, trying to pee
Lonely, frustrated, needy and depressed...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no
Cry for me
Here I know I know nothing
It's everything I dreamed
Ah, that's good
Has sound and fury
When the curtain opens, I show my gift
Our show will go on
You and I are a pair
Par!
It is too good there my name on the poster
I do pose, I get flower
but I know it is all a fleeting dream
There are those who resist?
I die to be a great...
Artist!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
IN THE SAME WINDOW
There you are
In the window in front
I want to see if you look at me.
And we once again
Blind desire
Will tonight
you gonna call me?
And if you want
Can I be your comfort
And if you want
My wishes can reveal
Hug
in your eyes and see me
Making love til dawn...
But if you want
I offer my care
If you want
I'm by your side
Hold you in your eyes and see me
Do not stop the game here
Do not go away soon
I need you
Say yes
I want to find
Come get me
So until tomorrow...
On another evening...
I get so exposed
What remains to show?
The doors closed
There is nothing to hide
And today I realized
What drives my desire
Then comes the embrace of the shadow
And this meeting is the loop
That binds me to be another
I'm ready to understand
The love that brings me so
I know I want to undress me
Of shame in me
The truth I'll get
Not knowing where I'm going
I'll look for my
Looking for my
Look at my body
And try to see who I am.
And if you want
Can I be your refuge
And if you want
Today I can give myself
Hold you in your eyes and see me...
Here
You use the ticket
I am a porn actor from the interior of Parana...
I like every time
more of my profession.
Here
Our dance group is a success.
Using only this song...
Going up!
Finally,
Prepare yourself: Let's sing!
I'll punch, I punch,
I punch, I punch
Finally,
The few who dare to show
Come and Robert Mitchum.
I am a great artist!
Here there is no Shakespeare or Moliere has
Critics write what she wants
I hear you moan
It is sensational
Thus the natural
Like any mortal
The coolest part
Our...
Our...
Our...
Our...
Nudity...
Total...
