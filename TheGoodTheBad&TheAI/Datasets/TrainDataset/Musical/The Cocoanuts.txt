We wanna see you, Mr. Hammer.
What's the matter?
Somebody pay their bill?
We want our money.
Yes, money.
You want your money?
We wanna get paid.
Oh, you want my money?
Is that fair?
Do I want your money?
Suppose George Washington's
soldiers had asked for money?
Where would this country be today?
But they did ask.
And where's Washington?
No, my friends. No, money will
never make you happy, and happy
will never make you money.
That might be a wisecrack,
but I doubt it.
We want our money.
I'll make you all a promise.
If you'll all stick with me and work hard,
we'll forget about money.
Let's get together and
we'll make a regular hotel
out of this place.
I'll put writing paper in the hotel,
and next year if you behave
yourselves, I'll put in envelopes.
I'm gonna put extra blankets
free in all your rooms.
There'll be no cover charge.
Think of the opportunities
here in Florida.
Three years ago I came to Florida
without a nickel in my pocket.
And now I've got a nickel
in my pocket.
That's all very well, Mr. Hammer,
but we haven't been paid
in two weeks and we want our wages.
Wages?
Do you wanna be wage slaves?
Answer me that.
No.
No, of course not.
Well, what makes wage slaves?
Wages. I want you to be free.
Remember there's nothing like
liberty, except  and
the
Be free, my friends.
One for all and all for me,
and me for you and three
for five and six for a quarter.
Pardon me. A couple of telegrams
for you, Mr. Hammer.
There you are.
Business is beginning
to pick up already.
Now if you gir...
boys will only be calm.
Uh-huh. " We arrive
this afternoon on the 4:30.
Kindly reserve two floors
and three ceilings."
They must be mice.
"If we like your property,
we will immediately buy it."
See that, things have
started our way already.
Who's it from?
Western Union,
and they've got a lot of money too.
On the 4:15, eh?
Well, I'll take the bus down myself.
Here's another one, Mr. Hammer.
See, we're gonna be
stuffed by tonight.
This hotel will be so crowded
that we'll be turning away
thousands of people.
"If there is another hotel
in Cocoanut Beach,
cancel our reservations."
I knew it. It was too good.
Wait a minute. " P.S.
Aunt Fanny had an eight-pound boy.
Can you come to the wedding?"
You see, everything is all right, boys.
Everything is all right.
You're all invited to the wedding
of Aunt Fanny's eight-pound boy.
Hooray!
Oh, but that won't be
for a couple of years yet.
In the meantime, I want you
to buck up, get down to work.
Let's put this thing
over with a bang.
And above all,
forget about money.
Don't think of it.
Just forget about it,
because you won't get it anyway.
Hooray. Hooray.
Hooray!
See that? I keep them
dancing for their money.
Jamison, I'm going down
to meet the 4:15.
If I never come back, you'll know
I'm still waiting for the train.
Yes, sir.
And in my absence, I'm relying on you
to take good care of everything.
You can depend upon me, sir.
That's fine. If any guests
come in, take good care of them.
And think of me, Jamison.
You bet I will.
I'll be back someday.
All right.
Keep a light burning in the window,
if you can find a window.
All right, sir. Good-bye.
Good-bye, Jamison.
Hello, Harvey.
Why so downhearted?
Is Bob Adams cutting
you out with Polly Potter?
I'm not worried about a hotel clerk.
No, but I'll bet you're worried
about the Potter millions.
You generally could use money
in the old days.
Oh, lay off that stuff.
You know, marrying Polly
is the only way for you
to square your debts.
I can take care of myself.
I doubt it.
Suppose I have a little plan
that'll take care of both of us.
What do you mean?
Have you ever seen that diamond
necklace of Mrs. Potter's?
You bet I have.
What's that got to do with us?
Her room and my room
are right next to each other.
Hers is 318; mine, 320.
The door between is unlocked.
Well?
She keeps everything in a jewel case
locked up in her dresser.
The key is always in her bag.
That's what you've got to get.
It's a large order,
but maybe it can be done.
Suppose I invite Mrs. Potter
and Polly to take supper
with me tonight?
What then?
Sometime during the evening...
I might be able to get
the key out of her bag.
Now you're talking.
That sounds more like old times.
And now I will try and get rid
of Bob Adams for you.
Look, this is Cocoanut Manor.
You know that hill?
What a question.
Do I know that cunning little hill?
It's cunning, all right.
But that's why there hasn't been
any development here.
Couldn't it be cut down?
Too expensive.
Now, here's what happened.
John W. Berryman
was here to see it last month.
You know, Berryman practically
built Palm Beach and Miami,
but he said he wouldn't touch this.
Now when a man like that passes
a place up, no one wants it.
Do you know anything
about architecture?
No, but I'd love to learn.
Well, I made a drawing
of the whole place showing the hills.
It's a built-up scheme,
without cutting down the hill
or having it get in the way.
I made the hill fit in
with the architectural scheme.
I sent Berryman a copy last week,
and his secretary
wrote me a nice note saying
they were studying my plans.
That's thrilling.
Does Mr. Hammer know about it?
Not yet. But if he takes it,
I'll design the buildings.
Say, I may be an architect yet.
If he only does, I'm sure it
will be the most beautiful
place in the world.
It would be...
if you lived there.
Look, see what I've written?
"Heaven for Polly and me."
That looks great.
When do I move in?
Any day now.
It's a lovely dream, Bob.
Let's make it come true.
The skies
Will all be blue
When my dreams
Come true
And I'll be smiling
Through
When my dreams
Come true
That Spanish castle
I built in my mind
Will be a love nest
The practical kind
And I'll be there
With you
When my dreams
Come true
Ever since I met you
All that I seem to do
Is dream
Wonderful dreams
Heaven's before my eyes
When will I realize
My dreams
Wonderful dreams
The skies
Will all be blue
When my dreams
Come true
And I'll be smiling
Through
When my dreams
Come true
That Spanish castle
I built in my mind
Will be a love nest
The practical kind
And I'll be there
With you
When my dreams
Come
True
Will you look at that?
I am looking.
Well, it's darn cute.
I wonder who it can be.
Let's find out.
Then little Red Riding Hood
said to the wolf,
"Wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf."
Hello.
Hello.
Your mother is
looking for you, Polly.
She generally is,
and she generally finds me.
You know Mother.
Thanks a lot.
It was a lovely story, Mr. Adams.
I'd like to hear
the rest of it sometime.
Good-bye.
I wonder if I could
hear it sometime.
With pleasure.
How about you, Yates?
No, thanks.
You know what happens
to bad little boys who tell stories?
Certainly. They marry
the beautiful princess.
So long.
And I'll be there
With you
When my dreams
Come
Nice boy. The kind who usually
gets what he wants.
Not always.
I might win out yet.
Well, miracles do happen.
Well, Polly, you've been
out again with Mr. Adams.
But only for a little while,
Mother.
Why a daughter of mine should
fool around with a hotel clerk...
when she has the opportunity of
marrying one of the Boston Yates...
is more than I can understand,
Oh, who cares
about the Boston Yates?
Anyway, Bob isn't a clerk.
He's an architect.
He's only clerking
until he can get started.
One who clerks, Polly,
is a clerk, and that settles it.
And I want you to remember
that no Potter...
has ever been involved
in a single scandal.
How about Uncle Dick?
Polly, it's a well-known fact...
that your uncle was drunk at the time.
Hey. Hey. Why don't you take
something for that insomnia?
You ought to cut out drinking
so much coffee.
I'm sorry, sir.
Say, any luck with the 4:30?
Yes, it didn't hit me.
That's the only luck I had with it.
Mr. Hammer, I think I know
what's wrong with the hotel.
I think I know too. You're fired.
Get your hat and my coat
and get out.
Maybe the season hasn't started yet.
Maybe the hotel hasn't opened yet.
Don't worry, Mr. Hammer.
In a few weeks you'll be cleaning up.
Yes, and making the beds.
Go on, get out of here.
I can handle this rush myself.
and you have to sleep here.
How do you do, Mr. Hammer?
Why don't you whistle at the crossing?
You're just the woman I'm looking for.
Now whether you like it or not,
I'm gonna tell you
about Florida real estate.
It's the first time it's ever
been mentioned down here, today.
I'm sorry, but...
Do you know that property values
have increased 1929 since 1,000%?
Do you know that this
is the biggest development
since Sophie Tucker?
Do you know that Florida is the show spot
of America and Cocoanut Beach
is the black spot of Florida?
You told me about this yesterday.
I know, but I left out a comma. Look.
In a little while we're gonna
hold an auction sale at Cocoanut Manor,
the suburb terrible... uh, beautiful.
You must come over.
There's gonna be entertainment,
sandwiches and the auction.
If you don't like auctions,
we can play contract.
Here it is. Cocoanut Manor,
by railroad.
There you are, Cocoanut Manor
glorifying the American sewer
and the Florida sucker.
Why, it's the most exclusive
residential district in Florida.
Nobody lives there.
And the climate... Ask me
about the climate, I dare you.
Very well. How...
I'm glad you brought it up.
Our motto is, Cocoanut Beach...
no snow, no ice and no business.
Do you know that Florida is
the greatest state in the Union?
Is it?
Take its climate. No, we took that.
Take its fruits, take the alligator pears.
Take all the alligator pears
and keep 'em. See if I care.
Do you know how alligator pears
are made?
Haven't the slightest idea.
That's because
you've never been an alligator,
and don't let it happen again.
Do you know that it sometimes
requires years to bring the pear
and the alligator together?
They don't like each other.
No.
No. Do you know how many alligator
pears are sent out of this state every year
and told not to come back?
I don't think I do.
All they can get a hold of.
Florida feeds the nation,
but nobody feeds me and that's
what I wanna talk to you about.
Mr. Hammer...
Another thing,
take our cattle raising.
I don't mean anything personal.
But here is the ideal cattle
raising section.
We have longhorns, shorthorns
and shoehorns.
Mr. Hammer, will you let me
say something, please?
I hardly think so,
and there's something else
I wanna bring to your mind.
Where will you be when you're 65?
That's only about three months from now.
If I were to buy, I should prefer
someplace like Palm Beach.
Palm Beach?
The Atlantic City of yesterday?
The slums of tomorrow?
Do you know that the population
of Cocoanut Beach
has doubled in the past week?
Has it?
Three bulldogs were born.
We're expecting a nanny goat in the morning.
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
I must be going.
Aw, now, don't go.
Before you go, let me show you
a sample of our sewer pipe
we're gonna lay.
Look at it. Nobody could fool you
on a sewer pipe, can they,
a woman like you?
Now this is the eight-inch pipe.
But of course, all property
owners will be allowed to vote
on the size of their pipe.
In case of a tie, it goes to the Supreme Court,
and I can give you a little
inside information in advance.
The chief justice is crazy
about this type of sewer.
Here, put it in your pocket.
I'll see you later.
Mr. Hammer, I can't use this.
I don't want it.
Hello. Yes?
Ice water in 318?
Is that so?
Where'd you get it?
Oh, you want some?
Oh, that's different.
Have you got any ice?
No, I haven't.
This is Cocoanut Beach...
no snow, no ice.
Get some onions.
That'll make your eyes water.
What? You too!
Oh, Mr. Hammer.
Mrs. Thompson wants to know...
if you'd reserve a table for dinner
for her in a nice quiet spot.
A nice quiet spot?
Yeah.
Tell her she can eat in the lobby.
We ought to dress this place up a bit.
It looks terrible.
Front. Front.
Front. Here, front.
Here, front.
Here, front, front, front, front.
Jamison, what's become of our front?
Are we all out of front?
I haven't seen 'em.
I'm gonna fire some of those people.
Give me the fire bell.
Why don't you stick around here.
If anybody comes in that looks like
a customer, tie 'em and brand 'em.
Yes, sir.
Look at him.
He's dressed better than I am.
Hey, come on. Come on.
Hey, come here. Come here.
Come here!
-
- How do you do?
Are you boys giving me
the runaround? Come over here.
Now what do you want?
Explain your business.
We send you a telegram.
Oh, you're the boys
that sent the telegram?
How do you do?
That's a coincidence.
I used to send telegrams myself.
How are you?
And how are you?
That's all right. Don't worry.
Say, you can stay, but you'll have
to take that groundhog out of here.
Now what do you want?
Explain your business.
We make a "reservash."
"Reservash"?
Yes. We want a room
and no bath.
Oh, I see. You're just here for the winter.
Well, step this way and
I'll see what I can do for you.
All right. We stay for the summer too.
I'm sorry, boys,
but we haven't got any vacancies.
He's got no vacancies?
That's all right, we take a room.
You want a room?
All right, we take a vacancy.
Hey, what are you...
Hey, hey, do you know
that suitcase is empty?
That's all right.
We'll fill it up before we leave.
Oh, you will, eh?
Well, you'll empty it before I go out.
Step this way, boys.
Just put your moniker on there
and everything will be "A.K."
Look what he do.
Don't do that.
Step right this way, boy.
Three shots for five.
He never misses.
This boy wins the gold cigar.
Anybody else? Step right this way.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't throw that.
That's only for long distance.
All right, all right.
Now what do you want?
Would you like a suite
on the third floor?
No, I'll take a Polack
in the basement.
Here you are.
Let me help you here.
I'm sorry.
The afternoon mail isn't in yet.
I can use you the first of the month.
Telegram for Mr. Hammer.
Just tell them I'll send them
the money in the morning.
Now then, what do you want?
What do you want?
Do you want a single room?
We'd like to double up.
Well, eat some green apples.
Just a joke.
What's that?
You'll have to talk louder.
I can't hear you.
If you'll take your nose out
of the receiver, it'll be okay.
Funny fella, you.
Hello. What's that?
You wanna know where you can
get a hold of Mrs. Potter?
I don't know.
She's awfully ticklish.
Now, I'm in a position, gentlemen...
He's a hungry.
Here, have one of these flowers.
They're buckwheat.
Pick out a nice one now.
I don't want you to get
any of the worst ones.
There you are.
I'm so glad.
Now, if you boys will pardon me
for a few moments,
I have some very important
business to attend to.
As a matter of fact,
I'm going upstairs to get
your partner a stomach pump.
He needs one.
And I'll be down in a few minutes.
And while I'm gone, don't forget.
Register.
Hey, don't forget. Register.
That's all right.
Hello. Hello.
No, we no got a no rooms.
We got a nothing.
We got a no customers.
We got a nothing.
All right. I send you up a some.
All right, good-bye.
Did you ring, sir?
Did you ring, sir?
Did you ring, sir?
Come on. Come here.
Come here.
Get away from those girls.
Come on.
Hurry up.
All right then, but let's be careful.
I will.
Tell me, how is it
that the door between your room
and Mrs. Potter's is open?
Well, you see,
I told her that I trusted her.
You trusted her?
Hey, stop that.
Come on. We dance.
Really!
Come, Penelope.
Let's get away from this... bum.
Bum. Bum.
Bum, bum, bum
I could kill those tramps.
Wait a minute.
Don't kill them yet.
I've got an idea.
About them?
Mm-hmm. Listen.
When the necklace is found missing,
someone's got to be blamed.
Why not them?
Gee, that's not bad.
But have you got anything definite?
Suppose I flirt with them
and they come to my room.
Then what?
I'll complain to the management.
Then on the night the necklace disappeared
they were seen near Mrs. Potter's.
Get it?
You bet I get it.
That's a grand idea.
Thanks, kind sir.
Well, I've got to run along now.
See you later.
Good-bye.
Hey, hey, what you do, eh?
All the time you eat.
That's a no good.
We gotta get the money.
Right now I'd do anything for money.
I'd kill somebody for money.
I'd kill you for money.
Oh, no, you're my friend.
I kill you for nothin'.
What do you laugh, eh?
You're in the hotel three hours
and you no got a something yet.
What do you got?
A beautiful watch. That's a fine.
That's a fine.
That's all you steal?
Hey.
I think I know your face.
I give up. Whose is it?
I'll tell you in a minute.
I brought some pictures
from headquarters.
Let me see your face.
Yours too.
All right. All right.
I make my own face.
Why you push, huh?
No pushing.
You wanna fight? Come on.
Come on. Start. Come on.
That's no funny.
You fight upstairs.
Hey! What are you guys
fighting for?
We no fight. That's a my friend.
We play this way.
What are you doing around here?
What's your name?
I'm pretty suspicious of you birds.
Now you listen to me.
I haven't got anything on you yet,
but I'm going to keep watching.
I've got your full records
right here in my pocket.
There's enough to send you up
the minute you start anything.
Do you get me?
Wise guy. Wise guy. Gotta start a fight
when the detective come around.
You can't wait a little bit, huh?
What do you got?
A badge.
That's a fine.
He's a no more detective.
You're a detective.
Hurry along, my dear.
Only a few minutes
to get to the train.
Can you tell me what time is
the next train to Philadelphia?
There's a train once a week
and sometimes twice a day.
Thank you.
That's all right.
That's a fine.
It's a little tight.
Needs something taken out.
All right, keep it.
That's just what I need...
a coat like this.
Hello.
How do you do?
That's a good-looking coat
you have on.
You like it, huh?
Do you know you look like
the prince of Wales?
Better.
Where'd you get that coat?
That's a my coat.
That's your coat?
That's a my coat.
But it doesn't fit you.
I know. I had it made to order.
Tell me,
what are you doing tonight?
Maybe you got a good idea, eh?
Well, don't you dare come
to room 320 at 11:00.
All right, I come half past 10:00.
Did you see a handkerchief?
I thought I dropped one.
Well, it really doesn't matter...
because what I'm really
interested in is you.
Did anyone ever tell you that you
looked like the prince of Wales?
That's funny. I thought it was
an original idea of mine.
Tell me, do you know who I am?
Do you know my room number?
Well, I'll be there at 11:00 tonight.
Did anyone ever tell you
you look like the prince of Wales?
I don't mean the present prince of Wales.
One of the old Wales.
And believe me, when I say Wales,
I mean Wales.
I know a whale when I see one.
Did you say your room was 318?
I'm the proprietor of this hotel
and I have a passkey
to every room in it.
Passkey?
Passkey, that's Russian for "pass."
You know they "passkey"
down the "streetskey."
Won't you, uh, lie down?
Aw, if we could find
a little bungalow, eh?
Of course, I know
we could find one, but maybe
the people wouldn't get out.
But if we could find a nice little
empty bungalow just for me and you...
where we could bill and cow...
No, where we could
bull and cow.
Do you know what
you're trying to say?
Yes, it's not what I'm thinking of.
What I meant was,
if we had a nice little bungalow...
and you was inside and I
was outside trying to get in
or inside trying to get out...
No, I was in... You was up...
You were inside out and I was up...
Uh, no...
I'll tell you, if you don't hear
from me by next Friday,
the whole thing's off.
I don't think I understand.
I mean, your eyes... your eyes,
they shine like the pants
of a blue serge suit.
What? That's an insult.
That's not a reflection on you.
That's on the pants.
What I meant was
if we had a nice bungalow...
and I came home from work
and you were standing by the gate...
No, you came home from work
and I was standing by the gate.
That's more like it.
And we came down the path...
and we went inside
and the shades were drawn...
and the lights were low,
and, uh... then, uh...
Are you sure
your husband's dead?
Why, yes.
There seems to be a trace
of uncertainty in that "yes."
You know, a yes like that
was once responsible for me
jumping out of a window.
And I'm not the jumper
I used to be.
What I meant was, you're gonna
be here all winter and I'm
stuck with the hotel anyhow,
why don't you grab me until
you can make other arrangements?
My dear, Mr. Hammer,
I shall never get married
before my daughter.
You did once.
Oh, but I love you.
I love you.
Can't you see how
I'm pining for you?
What in the world
is the matter with you?
Oh, I'm not myself tonight.
I don't know who I am.
One false move and I'm yours.
I love you.
I love you anyhow.
I don't think you'd love me
if I were poor.
I might, but I'd keep
my mouth shut.
I'll not stay here any longer
and be insulted this way.
No, don't go away
and leave me here alone.
You stay here and I'll go away.
I don't know what to say.
Say that you'll be truly mine,
or truly yours or yours truly.
Don't you know that I'm...
Will you keep your hands
to yourself!
Come on.
I'll play you one more game.
Come on.
The three of you.
Ohhh.
Can you come down
a little bit?
Just think, tonight... tonight...
when the moon
is sneaking around the clouds,
I'll be sneaking around you.
I'll meet you tonight
under the moon.
Oh, I can see you now...
you and the moon.
You wear a necktie
so I'll know you.
Send up some ice water right away.
That's right. Thank you.
Thank goodness.
Close the door.
Did you get the key?
Yes. It's one of these.
Oh, that's fine. Now, listen.
We can't take any chances on this job.
How do you mean?
There's bound to be trouble
when she misses the necklace.
Well?
We can't have it found on us.
I should say not.
We've got to play it safe
and hide it somewhere for a while.
Hide it?
Just for a few days.
Yes, but where?
Anywhere but in here.
Hide it?
I know just the place.
A hollow tree stump about a mile
from here. Will that do?
Fine, but how do I get there?
It's Cocoanut Manor.
You've been out there.
I'm not so sure, Harvey.
Here, I'll show you.
Now, you... you go
right out Cocoanut Road.
Then there's Augustine Road,
like this,
but instead,
you take the Granada Road.
Suddenly, you come to a clearing
with a fringe of trees around it.
That's Cocoanut Manor
where the stump is.
It's about 20 feet
from the edge of the clearing.
That's where you put the jewels.
You can't miss it.
Now you take the necklace
right out there, see?
I've got to go back downstairs,
or Mrs. Potter will be suspicious.
And be careful.
I will.
Cocoanut Manor, Granada Road,
Everything's going along
swimmingly now.
Do you remember me?
The prince of Wales?
Why, yes, of course I do...
Mr. Hammer, how dare
you come into my room?
If there's gonna be
two people in this room,
it'll be 50 cents extra.
Did he go?
Who?
Anybody.
Get out. Oh, Prince,
how you frightened me.
This hotel not only has running water,
it has running guests.
Do you remember me?
Prince of Wales?
- Who is it?
- It's me, the king of England.
-
-
Come in.
Ice water.
Put it there.
Thank you.
Come in.
Lay down.
Well, I never.
I should say not.
You get out of here.
Get out. Hurry. Hurry.
Come in.
What is the matter with that man?
Mr. Hammer, what are you
doing in my room?
I was only playing, that's all.
I'll find out about this outfit.
Who are you?
That's all right.
I'll be through in a minute.
- Well, I guess there's nobody in here.
- You don't know where to look.
What's that you said?
Oh, this is awful.
When you've quite finished,
let me know.
Well, everything seems
to be all right in here.
I'm not so sure about that.
All right. I know where to go.
Alone at last.
Come over here. I wanna see you.
Now listen to me.
I'm not gonna have
that red-headed fellow
running around the lobby.
If you wanna keep him up in the room,
you'll have to keep him in a trap.
I can't catch him.
Who is he?
That's a my partner, but he no speak.
Oh, that's your silent partner.
Well, anyhow, you wired me
about some property.
I've thought it over.
Now, I can let you have
three lots watering the front,
or I can let you have three lots
fronting the water.
Now, these lots cost me $ 9,000
and I'm gonna let you have them
for 15 because I like you.
I no buy nothing.
I ain't got a no money.
What?
You got a no money?
I no got a one cent.
How are you gonna pay
for your room?
That's your lookout.
Oh, you're just an idle "roomer."
Well, you see, we come here
to make money.
I read in the paper and it say,
"Big Boom In Florida."
So we come.
We're a couple of big booms too.
I'll show you how you can
make some real money.
I'm going to hold an auction
in a little while in Cocoanut Manor.
You know what an auction is, eh?
I come from Italy
on the
Well, let's go ahead
as if nothing happened.
I say I'm holding an auction
at Cocoanut Manor.
And when the crowd
gathers around, I want you
to mingle with them.
Don't pick their pockets,
just mingle with them...
I'll find time for both.
Well, maybe we can
cut out the auction.
Here's what I mean.
If somebody says $100,
you say two.
If somebody says two, you say three.
Bid up.
That's right. Now,
if nobody says anything,
then you start it off.
How am I gonna know
when they no say nothin'?
Well, they'll probably notify you.
You fool, if they don't say anything,
you'll hear 'em, won't you?
Well, maybe I no listen.
Well, don't tell 'em.
Now then, if we're successful
in disposing of these lots, I'll see
that you get a nice commission.
And how about some money?
Well, you can have your choice.
Now, in arranging these lots,
of course, we use blueprints.
You know what
a blueprint is, huh?
It's oysters.
How is it you never got
double pneumonia?
I go around by myself.
Do. You know what a lot is?
Yeah, it's too much.
I don't mean a whole lot.
Just a little lot with nothing on it.
Anytime you got a too much,
you got a whole lot.
Look, I explain it to you.
Sometimes you no got a enough.
Sometimes you got a whole lot.
Sometimes you got a little bit.
You no think it's enough.
Somebody else maybe
think it's a too much.
It's a whole lot too.
Now, a whole lot is a too much,
too much is a whole lot.
Same thing.
The next time I see you,
remind me not to talk to you,
will you?
All right...
Come over here, Rand McNally,
and I'll explain this thing to you.
Now look, this is a map and diagram
of the whole Cocoanut section.
This whole area is within
a radius of approximately
three-quarters of a mile.
Radius. Is there a remote possibility
that you know what radius means?
It's a W.J.Z.
Well, I walked right into that one.
It's gonna be a cinch explaining
the rest of this thing to you,
I can see that.
I catch on quick.
That's a rodeo you're thinking of.
Look, Einstein.
Here's Cocoanut Manor.
No matter what you say,
this is Cocoanut Manor.
Here's Cocoanut Manor.
Here's Cocoanut Heights.
That's a swamp.
And right over here
where the road forks,
that's Cocoanut Junction.
Where have you got
Cocoanut Custard?
That's on one of the forks.
You probably eat with your knife,
so you won't have to worry about that.
Now, here is the main road
leading out of Cocoanut Manor.
That's the road
I wish you were on.
Now, over here on this site
we're gonna build
an eye and ear hospital.
This is gonna be
a sight for sore eyes.
You understand?
That's fine.
Now, right over here,
this is the residential section.
People live there, huh?
No, that's the stockyards.
Now all along here,
this is the riverfront,
and all along the river...
all along the river,
those are all levees.
That's the Jewish neighborhood?
Well, we'll pass over that.
You're a peach, boy.
Now, here is a little peninsula,
and here is a viaduct
leading over to the mainland.
Why a duck?
I'm all right. How are you?
I say here is a little peninsula,
and here's a viaduct
leading over to the mainland.
All right. Why a duck?
I'm not playing Ask Me Another.
I say that's a viaduct.
All right. Why a duck?
Why a duck? Why a no chicken?
I don't know why a no chicken.
I'm a stranger here myself.
All I know is that it's a viaduct.
You try to cross over there a chicken,
and you'll find out viaduct.
I no go someplace...
It's deep water, that's why a duck.
It's deep water.
That's why a duck.
Look, rube. Suppose you were
out horseback riding...
and you came to that stream
and wanted to ford over.
You couldn't make it.
It's too deep.
But what do you want with a Ford
if you got a horse?
Well, I'm sorry the matter
ever came up.
All I know is that it's a viaduct.
Look. All right.
I catch on to why a horse,
why a chicken, why a this, why a that.
I no catch on to why a duck.
Well, I was only fooling.
I was only fooling.
They're gonna build a tunnel
there in the morning.
Now, is that clear to you?
Yes, everything except
why a duck.
Well, that's fine. Then we can
go ahead with this thing.
Now, look, I'm gonna take you down
and show you our cemetery.
I've got a waiting list of 50 people
at that cemetery just dying to get in.
But I like you.
You're my friend.
I like you and I'm gonna shove you
in ahead of all of them.
I know you like me.
I'm gonna see that
you get a steady position.
That's a good.
And if I can arrange it,
it'll be horizontal.
Now remember,
when the auction starts,
if somebody says $100...
I say 200.
That's grand.
Now, if somebody says 200.
I say 300.
That's great.
Now, you know how
to get down there?
No...
Now, look.
You go down there,
down that narrow path there...
until you come
to that little jungle there.
You see it?
Where those thatched palms are.
Yes, I see.
And then there's
a little clearing there...
a little clearing with
a wire fence around it.
You see that wire fence there?
All right. Why a fence?
Oh, no, we're not gonna go
all through that again.
You come along with me
and I'll fix you up.
I know what you mean.
Bid 'em up. Go higher.
One say 100, 2... 200, 300.
That's it. If somebody says
$100, you say 200.
If somebody says two, you say three.
Help me put this deal over,
you can have anything you got.
I got a nothing.
Be alert. That's it. Be alert.
Be alert, or papa don't go out at all.
I be alert. I don't know
what it is, but I be it.
All ye suckers
who are gonna get trimmed,
step this way for the big swindle.
Ladies and gentlemen, before proceeding
with the main business of the day,
which is the selling
of these lots at any price,
we're gonna have
a little entertainment...
very little.
I wanna present to you
Miss Polly Potter,
the best paying guest in the hotel.
In fact, the only paying guest
in the hotel.
She will sing for you and for me too.
Miss Potter.
Monkeys upon a tree
Never are very blue
They never seem to be
Under par
That is true
Not like the ones you see
On a bar in the zoo
Monkeys upon a tree
Do the monkey doodle doo
Oh, among the mangoes
where the monkey gang goes
You can see them do
The little monkey doodle doo
Oh, a little monkey playing
on his one key
Gives them all the cue
To do the monkey doodle doo
Let me take you by the hand
Over to the jungle band
If you're too old for dancing
Get yourself a monkey gland
And then let's go, my little dearie
Here's the Darwin theory
Telling me and you
To do the monkey doodle doo
That's Florida, folks...
singing, dancing and entertainment.
After the entertainment,
there'll be sandwiches.
But remember,
if there are no lots sold,
there will be no sandwiches.
Florida, folks... sunshine, sunshine.
Perpetual sunshine
all the year around.
Let's get the auction started
before we get a tornado.
Right this way.
Step forward, everybody.
Friends, you are now
in Cocoanut Manor,
one of the finest cities in Florida.
Of course, we still need
a few finishing touches,
but who doesn't?
This is the heart of
the residential district. Every lot is
a stone's throw from the station.
As soon as they throw enough stones,
we're gonna build a station.
will be built right here.
Why, they're as good as up.
Better.
You can have any kind
of a home you want to.
You can even get stucco.
Oh, how you can get stuck, oh.
Now is the time to buy
while the new boom is on.
Remember that old saying,
"a new boom sweeps clean"?
And don't forget the guarantee...
my personal guarantee.
If these lots don't double
in value in a year, I don't know
what you can do about it.
Now, we'll take lot number 20,
right at the corner of DeSota Avenue.
Of course, you all know who DeSota was?
He discovered a body of water.
You've all heard of the water
that they named after him...
DeSota Water.
Now this lot has a 20-foot frontage,
a 14-foot "backage"
and a mighty fine gobbet.
Now, what am I offered for this lot?

Wrap up that lot
and put some poison ivy on it.
Well, I came out even on that one.
That was a big success.
Yeah, one more success like that
and I'll sell my body to a medical institute.
Now, we'll take lot number 21.
There it is, right over there, folks.
Right where that coconut tree is.
What am I offered for lot number 21?

What the heck do you care?
But how about me?
Sold to What The Heck for $800.
I hope all your teeth have cavities.
And don't forget...
abscess makes the heart
grow fonder.
When he said "why a duck,"
I should have smelled a rat.
I did, but I didn't know who it was.
Now, we'll take lot number 22.

Will the gentleman who said seven

He say six, I say seven.
He say seven, I say eight.
He say eight, I say nine.
I got a plenty of numbers left.
When I start, I no a stop for nothing.
I bid 'em up. I go higher.
Higher, higher all the time.
You'll go higher
when I get a hold of you.

Too late. Too late.
Too late all the time.
Now, we'll take lot number 25,
right where you're standing.
Will you please
get your feet off this lot?
You're getting it all dirty.
Now, here's a lot, folks.
It doesn't look very big on top,
but it's all yours as far down
as you wanna go,
and it's dirt cheap.
Now, what am I offered
for lot number 25?
Anything at all. Who'll start it off?
Anyone at all. Anyone at...
What's become of Peter Rabbit?
What am I offered for lot 25?
Come on, folks. You know
you're allowed to bid.
This is a free country.
What am I offered for lot 25?
What am I offered for lot 25
and a year's subscription
to
Will somebody take a year's
subscription? I'm trying to work
my way through college.
Will somebody take a six-month's
subscription? I'll go to high school.
Does anybody wanna buy
a lead pencil?
I'll wrestle anybody
in the crowd for five dollars.
Well, if there's not gonna be
any more bidding, I might as well quit.
What's the matter with you people?
Can't you visualize bargains?
Don't you wanna make money?
I'm gonna try one more lot,
and if I don't dispose of this,
I'm gonna fold up. You get me?
We're gonna take lot number 26,
the star lot of the whole proceedings.
Here it is. Right there where

I'll bid...
Twelve? Twelve once.
Twelve twice.
Sold to Mr. Adams for $1,200.
And a mighty fine piece of property
you got there, buddy.
Oh, Bob, you've got it!
What happened?
I protest against that.
I didn't have a chance to bid.
What do you mean? I want you
to understand I don't discriminate.
You had the same opportunity
as everybody else.
Mr. Hammer.
Mr. Hammer, I've been robbed.
What?
My necklace in your hotel...
Oh, Mother.
It's worth $100,000.
Was it valuable?
"Was it valuable"?
I'll give a thousand dollars' reward
for its return.
You hear that?
This little lady has lost
a necklace worth $100,000,
and she offers a thousand dollars'
reward for its return.
Sold for $ 2,000.
Make a note of that.
Comin' through.
I'll take charge of this.
All you people get back
and give us plenty of room
and keep quiet.
Cut that out.
Come on.
Get back, everybody.
What's the matter?
What, he hurt you?
What's the matter?
No push, boy. Come on.
Come on. All right.
Start fighting. Go on.
Mr. Hammer, what's
the matter with him?
I don't know where he's from.
He hasn't any license on him.
What is it? What?
Yes, that's it.
That's it.
You dear man.
Oh, I'm so happy.
I must kiss you again.
So that's it. I saw you
in that room last night.
Grabbing off stuff
for the reward, eh?
Now then, you, come clean.
Hey! Let go of that.
All right. Leave him go.
Come on. Leave him go.
How'd you know
that necklace was there?
Officer, may I make
a suggestion?
What is it?
Isn't it possible that the gentleman
who bought this lot might know
something about it?
Why was he so anxious to buy it?
How about it, you?
Why did you buy this lot?
None of your business.
He is a desperate character.
Mother, he isn't.
Whenever a fella shuts up and
won't say anything, I've noticed it's
generally on account of a woman.
- Who is she?
- None of your business.
I won't say a word.
You won't say anything.
This guy's letting on to be a dummy.
This bird you can't understand
when he does talk.
Is there anybody here
who  talk?
I will, but I can't think of anything.
Well, if you won't tell me about it,
you'll tell somebody else.
Wait a minute.
You mean to say that...
That's enough. Come on.
Please. Please don't take him.
What?
I didn't want you to steal it, Bob.
I had no idea that you'd do it.
Oh, I feel awful.
What are you talking about?
Bob, what does she mean?
Polly.
Oh, it's all my fault.
I had no idea
he'd think that I meant it.
I didn't want you to do it.
I just meant that you
could give me one like it.
Wait a minute.
Are you accusing me
of taking Mrs. Potter's necklace?
I'm taking all the blame myself.
I was joking, and you
took me seriously.
Bob, last night when you
told me that you'd taken it,
I just couldn't believe it.
Told you I'd taken what?
Why, Polly, she's out of her mind.
It sounds quite plausible to me.
Mother.
He didn't know what he was doing.
I begged him to take it back.
Say, I'm not gonna stand
for any more of this.
Why, the whole thing
is ridiculous.
It's absurd!
Do you people really think
for one moment that...
Oh, I... I don't care what
you think, any of you.
Polly, you know it's a lie,
don't you?
It was just a harmless flirtation,
and then, well, he lost his head.
Don't you know it's a lie?
Of course I do.
You don't think I'd believe
a silly story like that, do you?
Polly.
Mother, I don't believe it!
Mr. Adams, I must ask you
never to speak to my daughter again.
But, Mrs. Potter...
Bob, I'm going with you.
You'll stay here.
Yes, Polly.
You stay here.
It's only for a little while.
Why, the whole thing is ridiculous.
You ready?
Yes.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Bob.
Don't keep it up any longer.
All right.
I'll have a confession
out of him in half an hour.
Come on, you.
Bob!
Will you come back here.
Now we'll take lot number 27.
I've been so unsuccessful
in disposing these other lots,
that I'm gonna give away
a half a pound of tea with
every lot I sell from now on.
There's only one way
to wipe out this disgrace.
You must make people forget
that you ever knew this young man.
Mother! What are you saying?
You see what's come of your way.
Now I'm going to have mine.
Mr. Yates?
Yes, Mrs. Potter?
My daughter has reconsidered
her answer to you.
Mother!
Your engagement
will be announced tonight.
That's wonderful, Polly.
I shall give a dinner at the hotel...
A dinner? A dinner?
You want the 30-
or 40-cent dinner?
You may invite everyone.
It's 50 with Jell-O,
and, oh, how you can Jell-O.
In honor of the engagement
of my daughter to Mr. Harvey Yates.
I see.
Let me be the last
to congratulate you, and you too.
I'm sure you'll have
a very dismal wedding.
Congratulations, Yates.
Congratulations, Polly.
Coming, Polly?
In a minute.
Please go ahead.
Why, what's the matter, dear?
Nothing. Please go.
All right.
I'll wait for you.
Oh, no.
You got the key?
That's fine.
Hey, wait, wait. Look.
I got the saw.
Now, you gotta get a something.
We get a Bob out. Hurry up.
Bob. Hey, Bob. Hey, Bob.
Hello.
What are you doing here?
How do you do?
I didn't know they allowed visitors here.
I'm a no visitor.
We come to get you out.
We gotta be quick too.
Thanks very much.
You shouldn't have bothered.
I might as well stay here
as any other place.
You gotta come out. Uh...
Polly, she wants you.
Polly wants me?
She gotta have you because
tonight she's gonna be engaged.
Engaged?
Yes, gonna be married.
Mrs. Potter, she's gonna give
a big engagement dinner.
To who?
To Polly.
He's engaged to Polly.
Everybody's gonna be there.
You too.
Polly's gonna marry Yates?
That's right. That's right.
Let me outta here.
Get me out of here quick.
We get you out. Hey,
Come on. Hurry up. Quick, quick.
Shh! Shh!
Now we get you out.
Thanks very much.
I don't want anything to eat.
Not at a time like this.
Come on. Hurry up.
Get me out of here.
We get you out.
What's a matter?
What a you do, eh?
Come on. Break a the lock.
Come on. Hurry.
What's the matter?
What's a matter for you?
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Stop fighting.
Stop fighting!
This is no time to fight.
Come on. Hurry up.
Get me out of here, quick.
Oh, come on. Hurry. Hurry.
Come on. Hurry up, Bob.
Everybody's away.
Is that so?
Well, I'll attend to that.
Boy.
It's been reported to me
there's a poker game
going on in room 420.
Go up there and knock on the door
and see if you can get me a seat.
Yes, sir.
All right.
I'll be right over.
All right, Bob. The coast is clear.
Nobody around.
Here he is. We got him.
We got him, all right.
Hello. Are you out on parole?
No. These two gentlemen
helped me to get out.
I'm ever so much obliged
to you, Mr. Hammer.
They told me it was your idea.
I can't begin to thank you.
That's all right. Maybe you do
as much for me sometime.
Well,
Good-bye.
I can't begin to thank you.
Why, that's polygamy.
Believe me,
it's no fun being in jail.
Jail is no place for a young fella.
There's no advancement.
But seriously, Mr. Hammer,
you know that story of Penelope's
was all a lie, don't you?
Now, what's the use of worrying?
It's silly to worry, isn't it?
You're gone today and here tomorrow.
But you know it was a lie.
How am I gonna prove it?
Well, of course...
What is it?
"Silent Red wanted by the police."
What's going on here?
Everything's been dropping
from on high here.
Grapefruit.
Well,
I hope I still got
my underwear on.
You know...
Come here with that.
I felt kind of flimsy.
Bob.
Yes, sir.
Go upstairs and count the rooms.
I think the third floor is missing.
I'll put this stuff in here
until I get ready to go upstairs.
Wait just a moment.
"Blackstone Hotel, Chicago."
"Statler Hotel, Cleveland"?
Those are mine.
Can you imagine that?
More papers than
any man I've ever knew.
"Granada Road. Cocoanut Road."
"Granada Road, Cocoanut..."
"Granada..."
Hey, if you get it twice more,
you're allowed to keep it.
Come here with that, will you.
You can beat that,
but you can't tie it.
"Granada Road..."
Don't, don't... Don't talk.
He'll take the words
right out of your mouth.
"Granada..."
"Granada Road. Cocoanut Road.
Hollow stump. Jewels."
Tell me, where did you find this?
That's a great guy you picked to ask.
Where did you find this?
Mr. Hammer, whoever
drew this knows something
about that robbery. Look.
When my dreams
Come true
And I'll be smiling
Through
When my dreams
Come true
That Spanish castle
I built in my mind
Will be our love nest
The practical kind
And I'll
Be there
With you
When my dreams
Come
True
Penelope, dear,
so good of you to come.
Thanks so much, Mrs. Potter.
Oh, isn't it lovely.
You're a lucky boy, Harvey.
Yes.
I know the party is going
to be a great success.
I hope so.
Hello, Penelope.
Oh, hello.
I didn't know you were
going to be here.
Anywhere that you are.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Is Mr. Hammer coming?
Mr. Hammer? Yes.
He'll be here directly.
Mr. Hammer,
your costume is wonderful.
This costume has been condemned
by
I love the color scheme.
That isn't a scheme.
It's a conspiracy.
Senor Chico Joseph Maria de Accunia,
Count de Elsinore.
On Track 25.
Aha!
Listen, Count. As soon as the guests leave,
I'd like you to take the ashes out.
His Excellency,
the ambassador from San Rafaelo,
Senor de Harpeno.
Hey, nix on that stuff.
Sure, and it's just
a breath of old Ireland.
I can see me old mother
comin' down the old path.
And I can see in the mornin'.
And I can see the old...
Diddly doo
Whoo, goes the weasel
There goes the weasel now.
I'm awfully glad you came,
Mr. Hennessy.
That's all right, madam.
At a party like this,
you've got to have the law around.
Now, a nice woman like you
needs protection, and I'm here
to see that you get it.
There's a couple of shady characters
hanging around that I'm going
to keep an eye on.
What's that you gave him?
I no give a nothing.
Give me that, I tell you!
Who got my shirt?
What's become of my shirt?
I want my shirt.
Hey, you've lost your shirt.
Yes.
Uh, can you describe this shirt?
What's that?
Here. Now, look.
This cross... This cross marks the spot
where the shirt was last seen.
Cut that out.
Now, remain quiet,
will you please?
Just as I thought.
You birds are all in on this thing,
and you're all trying to keep me
from finding my shirt.
That's a lie, you whelp.
Whelp, whelp, whelp, whelp, whelp.
Whelp, whelp, whelp.
I want my shirt.
He wants his shirt.
I want my shirt.
He wants his shirt.
He wants his shirt
I want my shirt.
He wants his shirt.
I want my shirt.
He wants his shirt
I want my shirt
I want my shirt
I can't be happy
without my shirt
He wants his shirt
He wants his shirt
He can't be happy
without his shirt
I want my shirt
He wants his shirt
He can't be happy
without his shirt
He wants his shirt
He wants his shirt
He won't be happy
till he has... his shirt
He's got it, he's got it
He's got it, he's got it
I've got my shirt back
Thank God, I've got my shirt
I've got my shirt
He's got it, he's got it, he's got it
I've got my shirt
You'll never know
how deeply I was hurt
He's got it, he's got it, he's got it
I thought I'd lost my shirt
He's got it, he's got it
he's got it, he's got it
It was given to me
by my brother Bert
His brother Bert
That's why I love this shirt
The beautiful shirt
My shirt
The wonderful shirt
Now that I've found my shirt
Good-bye
And now, friends, now that
we've found Hennessy's shirt,
would you all mind looking for
a collar button that I lost here?
Size 131/2.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
if you'll all find places
at the table,
we'll have a short entertainment
before supper.
Eat, eat, eat. Come on!
How about you and I
giving this joint the air and indulging
in some snappy necking?
What?
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Hammer will now act
as master of ceremonies.
Mr. Hammer.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Two hundred dollars.
In behalf of the Rotary Club
of Minneapolis,
I want to take this occasion
of welcoming you to Waukegan.
No, no, I mean, in recognition
of my many years of service
with the railroad,
you have presented me
with these ties.
And that, of course, reminds me
of the story of the Irishman.
It's so funny.
I wish I could think of it.
Oft in the stilly night,
the trembling of a leaf
can be heard...
sighing through the trees.
And the babbling brook,
as it wends its way onward,
babbling and...
Well, I got rid of one.
And one like that is worth
three ordinary ones.
Where was I?
Oh, yes, on this chair.
That's right.
Western cattle opened
at 15 and a quarter.
Yearlings and spring veal
showed a firm tone.
And eggs were a little touchy
on a falling market.
Well, my mother and father
talked it over, and they finally
moved to New York.
They took a little house in the Bronx.
And it was in that little house
that Abraham Lincoln was born,
much to my father's surprise.
And that, boys and girls, was
the beginning of the Lincoln Highway.
And now, friends, in view of the fact
that Miss Potter's engagement...
is being celebrated here tonight,
so to speak,
I think a few words from her mother
would be revolting.
I now take great pleasure
in presenting to you...
the well-preserved
and partially pickled Mrs. Potter.
Come on now.
Give the little girl a big hand.
Speech. Speech.
Big speech.
Speech. Speech.
My good, good friends,
if I could only tell you...
how rosy-hued everything
seems to me tonight.
The whole world,
and everything in it,
is bathed in a soft,
glowing, luminous haze.
The old gal is stewed
to the eyebrows.
And now I want to wish you all
a most enjoyable evening.
As for myself, I'm sad.
I simply can't go any farther.
I'll get off with you.
Now, friends, I want to take
great pleasure in presenting to you...
the groom Mr. Yates,
Mr. Harvey Yates.
Good evening, radio fans.
We are now back in the studio.
Stand by for your station announcer.
My dear, dear friends,
uh...
uh...
I, uh, really don't know
what to say.
Well, shut up.
What a splendid suggestion.
Good, eh?
I feel highly honored,
but I'm afraid I'm not much
of a speech maker.
Nevertheless, Mr. Hammer,
it was very nice of you
to call on me.
You must call on me sometime.
I was just about to...
Yes, come up and see my flower bed.
What I intended to say...
I want you to see my pansies.
Well...
I got short pansies and long pansies.
I was just going to say that...
Next spring I'm gonna get
some early bloomers.
As I was about to say...
There seems to be a steady stream
flowing in and out over there.
I wouldn't dream of taking up
any more of your time.
I really wanted
to thank you all.
Yeah.
And as I said before,
I hadn't intended to make
a speech at all.
Well, you certainly succeeded.
Now, friends...
Now what's the matter
with him?
That's that good Gulf gas.
Goodness.
I'm so sorry.
Hey, hey. What are you doin'?
Don't do that.
Come on.
That's a not a good.
Mr. Hammer.
Mr. Hammer,
can't you do something?
I don't have to.
They're doing plenty.
Oh, this is awful.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
the, uh...
the first musical, uh, number
that we intend to portray...
will be the, uh, beginning
and the ending of a very...
We're gonna have music.
Music. We're gonna have music.
Now, the first musical number
on the program...
will be a piccolo solo
which we will skip.
And the second number
will be Senor Pastrami,
the Lithuanian pianist.
The Senor, for his first selection,
will play " A Cup of Coffee,
a Sandwich and You"...
from the opera,
Senor, allow me
to escort you to the diet.
Uh, Senor Pastrami,
what is the first number?
Number one.
And now, friends, I want to present
to you a charming little lady.
Down in front.
Hey, sit down.
What's wrong with you?
The little lady who is to become
Mrs. Harvey Yates,
over my dead body.
I know I have the sincere wishes
of all my friends...
and can only tell you
how much I appreciate it.
I think I can honestly say this is
the happiest moment of my life.
Look what I have here.
It's a little engagement present
just given me by Mr. Yates.
He wrote it just now,
but he wrote another yesterday
when a necklace was stolen.
They are both
in his handwriting.
Let me read it to you.
It shows how to get to Cocoanut Manor
and the hollow tree stump...
and reads,
"Hollow stump, jewels."
I don't believe it.
See for yourself.
Yates is gone.
Yates is gone?
And I gave him a check this morning
for a thousand dollars.
It's a good thing
it was my personal check.
Mr. Hammer.
There's a man outside who wants
to see you with a black mustache.
Tell him I've got one.
Well, I think you
will want to see him.
His name is Mr. John W. Berryman.
He has accepted my architectural plans
for the development of Cocoanut Manor.
Well, happy days, old boy.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
He also wants to know
if you can accommodate
What in the world's
the matter...
Mother, you must admit
you were mistaken.
Mr. Adams, how can you
ever forgive me?
Oh, please, Mrs. Potter.
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're all invited to attend
the wedding of my daughter.
The wedding will take place
exactly as planned.
That is, with the exception
of a slight change.
She will be married
to Mr. Robert Adams.
Hooray! Hooray!
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
The skies
Will all be blue
When my dreams
Come true
The practical kind
And I'll
Be there
With you
When my dreams
Come
