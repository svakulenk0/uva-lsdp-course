- Boy, I'm sure glad this show is closing.
- Me, too.
You have another gig lined up after this?
No, but I know I don't want
to do another chorus line.
Well, Kelly, now that you've left
your life in the theater...
maybe you'd reconsider
my offer of four years at Princeton.
I haven't quit, Dad. I'm just taking a break.
I've told you a million times,
dance is my life.
I don't understand.
With your intelligence
and the opportunities that I could provide...
What about your young friend, that lawyer?
What's his name? Derek?
He wanted to marry you.
Why did you break up with him?
Derek is a nerd.
And you're the one that liked him, not me.
At least she's not spending time
with those street people anymore, darling.
Look, I come home to relax with you guys,
not argue.
But we are relaxing, dear.
I'm not arguing with you, Kelly.
I'm telling you.
I don't like the life you're leading.
It's my life, Dad.
We don't clean up
for any of the other girls like this.
This place is a mess.
It needs cleaning anyway.
You just now realized that?
The mere sound of Kelly's voice
on the phone drives the funk...
from your dingy socks away.
You should have more respect
for our dance partner.
Hey, look who's here!
Kelly!
Hey, Kelly!
Turbo! Ozone!
- Hey, Turbo, it's good to see you.
- Good to see you.
- Look at that rod.
- Hi.
I really missed you.
That's a sharp car.
Looks like show business
is treating you good.
Actually, I'm pretty burned out.
Yeah, I've been hustling for pennies.
Doesn't it seem like dancing
is just the same old tune?
Yeah, I know.
All those auditions and cattle calls.
"We'll call you next week."
Hey, look who's here! It's Kelly!
Special K!
Hey, Special K, look what Ozone taught us!
All right! Kelly's back!
So you're teaching class?
Yeah, I'm teaching class now.
!
Hey, man, come on.
Forget her, she's just a tease. Come on.
Turbo's in love.
Let's jam!
Miracles?
Yeah, it's our Community Center.
Turbo and I help out here sometimes.
Really, and this is where you teach?
Magician, show us around.
Are these guys professionals?
They're really good.
No, they're kids.
They're from the neighborhood. The ghetto.
I'm telling you, this place is fresh.
This is great!
This place is great for the kids, Kelly. Look.
Man, you have mirrors. This is great.
- Wait till you meet Byron.
- Where is he?
What's happening, champ?
- How are you?
- All right.
Good to see you.
Hey, hot stuff! What's going on?
How they doing anyway?
They're doing all right. Not deadly...
but they're determined.
What's this?
Who's the new talent?
This is Kelly. She's our dance partner.
Kelly, this is Byron,
the dude that runs this place.
- Good to meet you.
- Hey.
It's a pleasure. You must be the one
who danced with these two turkeys.
Yeah. It looks like you're doing a great job
with these kids here.
We try. If you have any spare time,
drop around.
We can always use help around here.
All right. I'll talk to you later.
Got to get back to work now.
- Come on, I want you to meet my kids.
- Okay.
These kids got a lot of talent.
Michael! Get off!
Look at those girls. They get off!
Come on, you guys,
I want you to meet Kelly.
How're you doing?
Michael, why don't you get out here
and show us what you got?
That's fresh! Try it like this.
Hey, come on. Let's turn the music up!
Got to get somebody down here
with a couple of flatbeds.
I don't know.
How long will it be before
we can start this project?
Not long. It'll come down soon.
Should pass through channels
in about three weeks.
Randall, I want this building.
This is the perfect site.
So how did you wind up here, anyway?
When Byron found it, it was a dump, Kelly.
- Yeah?
- We all got together and fixed it up.
It looks fantastic. You guys did a great job.
Yeah, well.
The kids really mean a lot to you?
It's like a second home to all of us.
This place is great. I love being here.
- You're between jobs, aren't you?
- Yeah.
You could teach.
You think it'd be okay?
You heard what Byron said, didn't you?
"We need all the help we can get."
I tell you, I would love working here.
Well, all right!
I want to build that shopping center.
I want to build it on the site
that we talked about.
The property values in that area
are just going to take off.
And that building that the kids are in...
that has got to go.
I'm working on it, but you know...
Commissioner Snyder is soft on these
so-called "community projects."
Randall, I want...
Zoning's cooperation.
Wait a minute, isn't this a city building?
Yes, the city loaned it
to some kind of local group...
for a community center.
They call it something...
"Miracles," that's it.
Miracles. What an inspiring name.
What do they do here?
It's just designed to keep kids off the street.
They have classes in art and dancing,
that kind of thing.
These ventures come and go.
The key thing though is that
our current engineering reports show...
that that building is structurally unsound.
It would be more cost effective
at this point to...
tear the building down,
and offer the property for sale.
And I don't think it would be bad
if we took this area...
and put in a shopping center here.
- But where will all those kids go?
- They've got their club, Radiotron.
- Well, Mr. Randall, you might be right.
- Good.
Look who's here, girls.
Electros rule the dance floor now, sucker!
Why don't you get back to your social club
and go play with the babies?
Come on, you guys,
let's turn these fools out!
Did you bring your mama along
to wipe your nose?
Be cool!
Look it, we're not gonna waste
any of our moves.
And we're sure not gonna dance
for you punks!
Ozone, look at this jive letter
they sent me this morning from City Hall.
What's this baloney?
It says our building is
going to be condemned...
unless somebody comes up
with $200,000 to fix it.
And I don't think the city is gonna
come up with that kind of bread.
- Let's raise the money.
- $200,000?
It's a whole lot of nickels and dimes.
We gotta try, champ.
Ms. Snyder, we received this letter
saying that you people...
plan to tear our building down.
Yes, Mr. Smith. I know about that letter.
What can we do to save Miracles?
Listen, kids, I really am on your side.
But the best that I'm able to do
is get you a 30-day grace period...
so that you can raise some money
to renovate that building.
We appreciate your 30-day grace period...
but do you really think that's long enough
to raise that kind of money?
I don't know.
But I do know this is your only chance.
At least we have a chance.
- Thank you.
- Here, look!
!
Here's $100.
$7,000.
Not looking too good, is it?
Come on, you guys, it's a start.
But we don't have too much time
before the end.
$7,000 is not going to impress
the Zoning Committee at all.
Why don't we just put on a show?
Like those big ones
with the dancing and juggling.
We could have it in the streets.
Like a street festival.
I'll dance!
I could choreograph.
I'll run rehearsals.
And of course...
I could be the star.
So they called you about me?
Yes, they're considering you for the lead.
It opens in Paris.
In Paris? You're kidding.
Stanley! That's great!
Relax. You still have to audition.
I'll call you when they set a date...
if I can find you.
You've been hard to reach lately.
I've been teaching
at this Community Center.
It's very noble,
but don't let it interfere with your career.
I have had a lot of time on my hands lately.
Don't worry, that'll all change.
Okay, I'm going to hold you to that.
Nice to be working with you again, Ozone.
Yeah, it is.
- Here, help me carry this.
- Sure.
Okay. Back it up.
- Hi! Sorry I'm late.
- Hi, Kelly.
Guess what? Stanley got me an audition.
I might be the lead in a show
that's going to Paris.
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah.
But what about this show?
You guys got a lot done.
You gonna stick with us or what?
Electro Rock!
Hey, let's take these suckers!
Later, sucker.
I'll get that guy!
Ozone.
You been off the street too long, blood.
You got lazy. You lost your edge.
You're the loser, punk.
Try me.
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
!
Hey, kid, get out of the way, all right?
What are you doing?
What kind of camera is that?
Look, you'll have to get out of here, sonny,
we've got some work to do.
Doing a movie? Can I be in it?
No, we're surveying the land.
Mr. Douglas here
is going to build a nice new supermarket.
- You mean here? At Miracles?
- That's right.
You get back to work, and you, kid...
you get out of here.
Look, let's pack up.
We've got enough for now to go on.
Over there!
Hey, hold on, buddy, what's going on here?
What are you fellows doing here
with that equipment?
Well, we're making a preliminary survey
of potential construction sites.
The name is Douglas.
Whoever you are, you got no business
coming around here with that equipment.
We haven't had a hearing yet.
And you don't own this property yet.
I'm very aware of the fact
that the city owns it.
Are you, perhaps, a city official?
No, we're the legal tenants here.
That's a situation I don't think
will last very long.
Yeah, well, look here, hot shot...
you can forget your plans, man,
'cause we're going to stop you.
We're going to stop you cold.
I doubt if an arrogant bunch of street kids
have the power to...
You don't how much power we really have,
do you?
We'll go to the press,
and we'll fight this thing all the way.
Well, it's your time.
Waste it if you want to.
Is that man going to take away Miracles?
No, we're not gonna let him.
Yo, Turbo. Hey, man, you know,
we should work on some new moves, man.
Somethin' fresher than fresh, man.
Somethin' funkier than funky.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, man, let's put on...
- Let's put on some OIlie and Jerry.
- Yeah, that'd be cool.
Hi, Ozone.
Ozone, I'd like to talk to you.
What do you want to talk about?
- Hi.
- Bye.
Are you going with that Kelly now?
Oh, girl, what difference does that make?
- It makes a difference to me.
- It shouldn't.
Look, that thing between us, baby,
was over a long time ago.
Well, I still love you, Ozone.
- Look, Rhonda, I'm sorry.
- Forget it!
I don't need your sympathy, Ozone!
What do you want?
You know what I want?
I want you to stay away from that girl!
Girls are whacked.
Come on.
Hey, man, what did she say?
She thinks you're sexy.
She wants to dance with you.
Go on, man, I think she likes you.
Yo, Ozone, you think I look like a stud?
Did you say something?
You think I got sex appeal, dude?
Gimme a break.
You're acting weird.
Dude, I need some advice.
What advice?
I wanna know
how to start off with a girl, dude.
Yeah? You mean, you're askin' me
how to get it on with a girl?
Well, something like that.
All right.
If that's the case...
I'll show you a few tricks of the old master.
There's two phases to this.
There's phase number one.
You got to get the girl interested.
Then there's phase number two,
the old tactical maneuver.
First, you've got to get the girl
to come to you.
After that, you've got to play it cool.
You walk by like this.
Real close.
Then you look at her.
Only, she doesn't know you're looking.
Now you try it.
Go ahead.
Okay, suppose she knows I'm there.
What do I do next?
- Tell her I love her?
- No, if you tell her that...
She doesn't even know you yet.
- Can I kiss her?
- No.
Do that, and she'll punch your lights out.
Then what do I do?
You do like I do.
You just stand there and you smile.
Smile? Like this?
No, matter of fact, don't smile at all.
Well then, can I kiss her now?
No, you whisper in her ear.
Whisper what?
You know, softly, like,
"Hey, baby, you look fine.
"I like you. Hey, check this out."
Butter up to her. Try it.
Here, try it.
Go ahead.
You have the nicest...
teeth.
No, man, she's not a horse.
Tell her about her eyes.
Your eyes are so...
- brown.
- No.
Move over. Let's start from scratch.
Let me show you how you do it.
Here we go.
Everybody. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.
Every one of you did a fine job.
I'll contact your agents about the part
next week. Thank you very much.
Now I know this director.
Your chances with him are excellent.
Man, I wish I could know right now.
I don't know what
I'm going to tell Ozone, though.
All you used to talk about was your work,
now all I hear is Ozone, Ozone.
Are you in love with the guy?
Come on, Stanley.
I just like the way he dances.
What's this Stanley tells me about
our daughter dancing in Paris?
Darling, she doesn't have the job yet.
I also understand that she's been
back in the streets with that...
Bozo or Turbine
or whatever the hell their names are.
She isn't in the streets, she's volunteering.
It's charity work.
She's helping all those
poor, little, underprivileged children.
Yeah, I'm going to do something about
all this nonsense.
I don't know what you can do. Kelly's
old enough to make her own decisions.
- I'm going to find a way. Call her up.
- Yes, dear.
- Get her over here for dinner.
- Yes, dear.
- I want to talk to that girl.
- Yes, dear.
You know, maybe my father could help.
I'm invited over for dinner tomorrow night.
Why don't you guys come over?
That's a whacked idea.
Why? He's an intelligent man.
He can help us out or give us good advice.
I don't beg from rich people.
I work for what I get.
- I thought you'd do anything for those kids.
- Well, it's not that.
I don't want to use you, Kelly.
That's okay.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Wow, this is some layout.
When you said money,
I wasn't expecting all this.
Come on, Ozone, they're just people.
Rich people.
Very rich people.
They're also my family.
- So are we.
- I know. Come on.
Hi, Rosa.
I'd like you to meet my friends.
This is Ozone and Turbo.
Hi, Mom.
- Hello, dear.
- Good to see you.
How you been doing?
So you must be Turbo and Ozone.
You certainly have original names.
Unique flair for fashion...
which apparently is rubbing off
on my daughter.
Thank you.
That must be Dad.
- Thank you.
- Derek?
Hello, Evelyn. You look lovely as always.
I'm so happy
you could accept our invitation.
Thank you very much.
Hello, Kelly.
Hi.
Boys, this is Derek Sloane, Kelly's fiancé.
- Hi.
- What's up?
Hello.
Mother.
What's he doing here?
You know I can't stand him.
Don't blame me, I didn't know.
Well, your father thought
it would be a good idea.
Sharp outfit.
We know.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, honey.
I want you to meet my friends.
- Good to see you. How are you?
- Very good.
How's your law practice coming along?
Very well. Fortunately, in Hollywood,
everybody sues everybody.
Shall we dine?
Bon appétit.
So, what do you think?
Good?
See, Mrs. B...
everyone loves your cooking.
They should. After all, you spent a fortune
sending me to Cordon Bleu.
- It was well worth it.
- But I do enjoy it.
It's pretty good.
This is the first time I've tried this dish,
but I'm really rather pleased.
Wonderful.
Yes, it is good.
You know, I think I'm going to have
just a little bit more, if I may.
Well, boys,
how are things going down at your club?
Kelly tells me you've been doing
wonderful things for these...
poor, little deprived children.
Actually,
Miracles is having some trouble, Dad.
Those people can't stay out of trouble,
no matter what.
You're looking at one of "those people."
Derek didn't mean to be rude.
Did you, Derek?
Derek always means to be rude.
Well, what kind of trouble are you in?
We're not in trouble, our building is.
They want to tear it down
and build a stupid shopping center there.
But they're giving us a chance
to save the building.
Oh, I see.
You're here for money.
I know what you people do with money.
You mismanage it.
You spend it on drugs
and fancy clothes and cars.
Dad!
I don't see any point
in throwing good money after bad.
Come on, Turbo.
Look, we don't need your help.
We can take care of our own.
And thanks for the dinner, Mrs. Bennett.
Yes, we loved your cooking.
Could we have a roll?
Arrogant riffraff.
Sorry about the other night.
I should have known better.
My parents live in a world all their own.
That's okay. I kinda liked your cat.
Ozone was really mad, though.
He was mad, but he wasn't mad at you.
It was just...
Don't worry about it. He'll cool off.
Kelly, listen to this situation.
I've got this friend. He likes this girl.
Does she like him?
Yeah.
Then what's the problem?
Well, it's just that he gets so confused...
because he's such a cool dude,
and he's never had these feelings before.
- This must be a good friend of yours, Turbo.
- Yeah.
Don't worry about it so much.
I've seen her looking at you.
It's just that I don't know what to say or do.
Just say yes.
- "Yes"?
- Yes.
Yes!
Yo! Strobe!
Get away from me, man.
I ain't got nothin' to say to you.
Look, man, I want to call a truce, all right?
We want you with us.
Look, if they tear down Miracles,
that's our neighborhood.
Don't you see, man?
They'll redevelop us out of existence.
We need your juice, Strobe.
We need to be united, man.
Ozone, don't lay the jive on me, man.
I don't need it.
Ozone, guess what?
They offered me the part.
I can go to Paris if I want to.
Are you going or not?
I don't know. I have to decide tonight.
It's what you want. Take it.
It used to be what I wanted.
I don't even know anymore.
Hey, look, baby, I can't decide for you.
I thought you wanted me
to stay and help with the show.
It's your life and your career, isn't it?
Why don't you ask your fiancé, Derek?
Maybe he can help you decide,
because I can't hang, baby, you dig?
What's the matter, honey?
Did Ozone break your little heart?
He's not your type, girl.
I really don't want to talk about it
right now, okay?
I suggest you stay away from him.
Just leave me alone.
You don't belong with Ozone.
You don't belong in this neighborhood.
Honey, you just keep showing your
pretty little face around here...
and it's not going to stay pretty
much longer.
Stanley, hi, this is Kelly.
I've decided to take the job.
Yeah, when do we leave?
Yeah, I'll be ready.
Why don't you call me
when you get all the details?
Kelly, you are so lucky to be going to Paris.
Do you know when your father and I
honeymooned there, it was so romantic?
All those wonderful little cafés.
I loved it. It was so beautiful.
We had such fun.
Your father looked so handsome
in his white linen suit.
Darling.
You'll forget all about this
once you get to Paris, really you will.
Let's go, okay, Mom?
Viable for who?
And the floor recognizes this panel's
trying to push us out of our neighborhood.
!
Right.
And the public says that Miracles is more
than just a piece of property.
It's people.
Miracles is the lifeline of our kids.
Now, we know what kids can do
with pistols, knives and needles.
Miracles makes them
feel good about themselves.
Gives them something to look forward to.
Gives them a sense of achievement.
And it's not by stepping on people.
It's by working hard and working together.
It's not unsafe.
But we're working on a show.
We'll make lots of money.
- You're crazy.
- Crazy?
!
!
- What?
- You're crazy.
- You can't do that.
- Come on.
You guys are whacked, man.
Whacked?
Who...
Wait a minute.
Yo, Douglas.
You haven't won yet.
You may have the city dancing
to your music, but you don't have us.
Get out of my way.
Hey, man, we're going to stop you,
commission or no commission.
Listen, if you cause me more trouble...
I'll finish you, your friends,
and your whole damned neighborhood.
Listen, sucker!
What are we going to do now?
Well, if there's one thing
I'm sure we're going to do...
- it's not give up, right?
- Yeah!
That's right.
Bobby, set that on the corner post.
Hey, man.
- Take my picture!
- Get out of here, okay?
What seems to be the problem?
Come on, kid, beat it, will you?
Yo, man, what's up?
- I got your lunch!
- Hey, right now. Come on.
See? I'm ready.
Who's that? Can you get it?
- Ozone.
- Kelly, Turbo's been hurt real bad.
- Where is he? What's happened?
- He's in the hospital. Come on.
Kelly, you can't miss this plane.
You're expected in Paris tomorrow.
Paris is going to have to wait.
They won't wait. They'll hire someone else.
Well, let them hire someone else,
or get me another ticket or something.
Yes?
Turbo, why don't you wake up,
you suck-off?
Yeah, man. Come on, wake up.
What're you doing in there?
- I don't know. What's she doing in there?
- Maybe she lives in there.
He's talking!
- He's okay!
- I don't believe it.
- Hey, man, don't leave now.
- Hey, man, wake up.
Man, I am hungry. Get me some food!
He's hungry! Turbo's hungry.
Come on, he's okay!
Now you two, get on with you.
This is my floor.
Stop it!
!
No, we're losing him!
He's flatlining, Doctor.
There's nothing I can do.
It's too late. We lost him.
What happened?
Dad?
I find this hard to believe...
but Stanley tells me that
you backed out of that Paris deal...
in order to run off with that...
street dancer.
Well, may I come in?
Oh, boy.
I've got an offer for you, Kelly.
I'll bail out Miracles,
pay the cost of renovation...
on the condition...
that you stay out of that neighborhood,
and go to Princeton.
I really do want to help Miracles.
Maybe I should do it.
A very sensible decision.
No, you won't.
I can't let you do that.
That's not what you want.
That's not what you are.
Why don't you just stay out of this?
I told you, we can take care of ourselves.
We don't need your money.
But we do need you.
You really mean that.
Wise up.
Your pride can't afford to turn down
an offer like this.
And what do you know about pride?
Pride's more important to our kids
than your money will ever be.
Nobody is going to tell me
when to lay down my pride.
Let me tell you something.
That theatre, or whatever it is, of yours...
that's just another public project
that takes good money...
and throws it down the toilet.
Why are you always
so negative about everything?
Everything that I have ever wanted to do,
you have always been against it.
Dad, I'm staying.
You're making a big mistake, Kelly.
I've got to get out of here.
I've got to get back to Miracles
and help with the show.
I can't be laying up in this traction.
You don't understand.
You...
must help me get out of here.
It's very important for me to get out of here.
I can't lie in bed...
Look.
This belongs on stage, not in no hospital.
Come on.
Are you new here?
You have to take linens down
in the service elevator.
Me no English.
When are they going to hire some help
that speaks the language?
Guess who?
Hey, you guys ready for the show?
Tear this show up, right on.
What's she doing here?
I thought I told you to stay away from here.
- I didn't take your advice.
- I can see that.
Kelly, I'm only going to tell you this
one more time. Leave.
You're not going to tell me what to do
or where to go.
I liked it a lot better here with you gone,
and I want it to stay that way.
You think you're so tough, don't you?
Well, you don't have your bodyguards.
You know, I turned down
a good job in Paris to stay here...
and not you or anybody
is going to tell me when to leave.
I'm staying!
What are we going to do, Ozone?
I know what we're going to do.
Turn on the music.
Get out of here! Move away!
Get off that machine!
- What's going on here?
- Look at this.
Never mind that.
I said to get this thing moving.
Now get it moving!
- Okay, you're right.
- Damn right, I'm right.
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, that's Turbo.
Come on now, move it!
Get out of the way.
Get out of here, man, what's up?
Get away from there, kid.
You going to run me over
with the bulldozer?
You going to try break down the building?
You'll have to get past me, sucker.
Man, I said stop!
- Why did you stop?
- The kid...
I don't care about the kid.
Knock that stage down now!
- No way.
- What do you mean, "No way"?
- You paid for a job, not to kill kids.
- Who're you working for?
- We're going home.
- No, you're not.
You wait here.
I'll get that kid out of the way.
- I'm staying right here, man.
- Let's go, let's get out of here.
Where are you going?
Bring that machine back here!
You'll not work again for me!
Bring that machine back!
We'll be right here,
we'll get the background, okay?
Good afternoon.
This is Howard Howard, Channel 3 News.
Today, the little guys
are going to take on the big guys.
Right behind me here
you see a bunch of spunky kids...
who are getting ready
to fight City Hall in their own way.
Why? Because they don't want
this Community Center...
torn down for a shopping center.
There's a gentleman here I'd like to bring in.
This is Mr. Ken Randall,
from the City Planning Office.
Howard Howard, Channel 3 News.
I've got a quick question for you.
Will the city let these kids
lose their Community Center?
No, the city is here for the people.
And there's obviously been some kind
of a snafu here.
These things happen,
even in the best of cities.
But I can assure you...
that we will do everything
to straighten this out...
for the benefit
of those deserving youngsters.
And that's good news.
The gentleman coming here is Mr. Douglas,
Douglas Construction.
Mr. Douglas is head of the firm
that wants to tear down this site.
Howard, may I take Randall?
It's important. I need some information.
Certainly.
- What did you say to that guy?
- I said it was a snafu.
What do you mean, "snafu"?
The mayor doesn't need bad publicity
in an election year.
Are you telling me that you and the city
are going to pull out of this?
Yes.
Mr. Douglas. Question, sir.
What action do you plan to take
against these kids blocking your project?
Oh, well. We're not going to take any action.
We of the
Douglas Construction Company feel...
we won't disrupt the community,
we will withdraw from the project.
This is a new
and dramatic development, here.
I would like to get a little reaction
and comment from Mr. Byron Smith.
Well, you just heard Mr. Douglas
change his mind on the whole affair.
And I'm sure that Mr. Douglas
will make a nice, sizeable contribution...
to help us pay our loan just fine.
- That right, Mr. Douglas?
- A contribution, yes.
It was suggested that $3,000...
That was suggested by Mr. Randall.
But we, of course,
of the Douglas Corporation...
feel that $6,000...
really isn't enough for this project.
Therefore...
In fact, we're going to make a donation...
of $10,000!
As you can see,
there's a lot of excitement here today.
Finally the little guys
are coming out on top...
and I think that victory
deserves a lot of applause from all of us.
Ozone, quick question!
Howard Howard, Channel 3 News.
You really danced your way to victory today.
Well, it's not over yet.
We need a miracle to save Miracles.
We're $150,000 short.
Why don't you tell them about it?
We're having a show today, right here,
to raise money to save Miracles.
There will be dancing, juggling,
the whole works.
So come down,
enjoy yourself and celebrate with us.
I'd like to see you there.
My God, it's Kelly!
I do wish
she'd do something about that hair.
!

!
- Give!
!
!
These kids have put together
such a show here today...
and single-handedly have raised
over $150,000, which is some feat.
But it's not enough. They have more to go.
They have to raise at least $200,000.
Are they going to make it?
We're going to support them.
You've got to hand it to those kids.
They really fight for what they believe in.
Darling, that's what
we always taught Kelly to do.
Didn't we?
You know, Mrs. B, I think you're right.
Let's go.
Dad, what are you doing here?
I thought you...
I've been thinking.
I guess we all have to live our lives
the best way we possibly can.
You kids have done a great job here today.
I'm proud of you, Kelly.
All of you.
Even without Princeton?
Yeah, even without Princeton.
Thank you, Dad!
All right!
