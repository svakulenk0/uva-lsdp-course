The wind across the water
A cloud across the skies
The music in the echo
Of the eagle as she cries
The winter light at sunset
The full moon on the rise
Everything, everything flies
A mother's prayers to heaven
A young boy's paper kite
The breeze that brings the morning
A comet through the night
Aurora borealis
As it sweeps across the skies
Everything, everything flies
Time and stars and innocence
Childhood's waking dream
The spark that leaves a dying fire
The trout that breaks the stream
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
La-la, la-la, la, la-la
The sound of children's laughter
When they're having fun...
Whoa, there!
The pride that leaps from heart to heart
When a job has been well done
The love of friends and family
Shining from their eyes
Everything, everything flies
Ah, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah, ooh-ooh-ooh
Lt'll come. You'll see.
It'll come.
Why does that have
such a familiar ring to it?
I know. We've been
coming here for the
last three days.
At the crack of dawn.
So it's been a little early.
But that's when I saw it.
Trust me. It'll be worth it.
Well, wake me up when it arrives.
That's louder than a wild-eyed grizzly!
Isn't it beautiful? Come on, Jenna.
OK. It was... worth it.
Even if I am going to have
a heart attack. Phew!
What is it?
I don't know. But look at it go.
Don't you ever wonder
what it's like up there,
looking down on the world?
No, not me. I don't get how
that big steel whatever-it-is
can fly like a bird.
But what a feeling.
You wanna be up there, flying?
Sometimes,
in my dreams,
I'm soaring above
the clouds, free.
Dipsy!
You're not getting
into anything, now,
are you girl?
Didn't think so.
Good girl.
It's a disaster, mayhem,
a catastrophe.
Hey, Mel. I brought you
a treat from the store.
Thanks, Dipsy,
but I can't eat a thing.
Nervous stomach.
Good.
I already ate it.
So, what's news?
News? Don't you know
the mail is late?
Honey, it's late at least
once a week. Why
worry?
I'm not worried.
I'm just reasonably concerned.
I'm frantic. Why are the dogs
late with the mail?
Uh, they're playing bridge?
No. I'll tell you why.
Something terrible
must have happened.
What if the dogs
went right over a cliff?
Splat!
Or they coulda been
buried in an avalanche.
Mel, calm down.
Ow!
No, they're probably
out there right now,
bleeding and torn to shreds
after a vicious attack by grizzlies.
Oh, my.
I think I feel a migraine
coming on.
I think I'll join you.
What in the name
of Yukon Jack is that?
What the heck is it?
Trouble. That's what it is.
Yah! Yah!
Yah!
Mush! Mush!
Whoa, whoa!
We're late again.
What's the big deal?
We're just running the mail,
not saving the town.
- Like your old man.
- Zip it, Ralph.
We would have been on time
if you hadn't been dragging your butt.
Me? I've got a broken toenail
and it's driving me crazy.
Besides, Kirby kept yanking to the right.
I had a lousy
breakfast this morning.
I got no energy.
It wasn't our fault.
Hello. The ice
was slippery.
Everybody knows the
snow is treacherous
in the spring.
Yeah. That's it.
The snow's getting
soft.
Warmer weather,
mushier snow.
But that's no excuse
for being late.
Everyone counts on us.
Neither snow nor rain
nor sleet nor hail
will stop the U.S. Mail.
Yeah. What are they
gonna do? Fire us?
Rookies. They're
all the same.
Look, Kodi. Bottom line -
we got the mail to Nome.
Enough said.
Mail's here, Mr. Conner.
Hey there, Mr. Simpson.
I'm OK.
Looks like the mail
finally arrived today.
Very funny, Balto.
You know Kodi is proud
of his new job.
He does get that
gleam in his eye.
Hi, Dad. Hi, Mom.
Looking good out there, son.
You think so?
I've been practicing on
the beach. I'm kind of...
Well, I'm hoping to get
a chance at lead dog.
Like you, Dad.
Well, you keep working
hard and I'm sure
you'll get there.
It's here. My God, it's here.
What's here?
Hey, boy. A dog
welcoming committee, huh?
Why don't you guard my plane?
I'll be back soon.
What is that thing?
Watch it, Balto.
Dad, don't go getting any ideas.
Me?
You think I'd just hop in
and go for a flight?
Yes.
You're right. I would if I could.
I got a bad feeling
about this.
When don't you
have a bad feeling?
Guess we can
agree that spring
is officially here.
So where's Boris?
Be-ba-ba ba-doo ba
Wah-wah, mmm
Ba-ba-a-am
Ba-wah-wah, whoa
Morning, big boy.
Your moving is
getting me grooving.
Oh, you cannot see
I'm taking personal bath
here?
You bet your little patootie.
But I figure two in a bath is
a whole lot more fun than one.
The name's Stella.
I just flew in for the summer.
It's my first trip to Nome
and I like what I see so far.
What's your name, big boy?
Boris. But my friends
are calling me...
Boris.
All right, honey. Boris it is.
That's a strong, handsome
name for a strong,
handsome goose.
So, where
are you from, Boris?
I can tell it's not from around here.
I am living in Nome for a long, long time
but I was born in Russia.
Really? Cos you don't have an accent at all.
I was hoping to see
the picturesque sites here.
Then later,
you can show me
this one-horse town.
That can be arranged.
Hold it! Hold it!
Uncle Boris!
Enough. Enough! Put me down.
Play with us, Uncle Boris.
Give it a go, please?
No. No!
Not another game of...
Slosh!
Absolutely not.
No slosh. No.
No. No.
All right, Luc, on three.
Maximum velocity.
One...
No!
Two...
No! Nyet! Hold!
Three!
No! No! Nooo!
Enough! Enough! Enough!
How many times am I telling you?
Stop what you are doing.
But wasn't that fun, Uncle Boris?
Fun? Fun is birthday party.
That was big pain in tush.
I say stop, you go.
I say no more,
you do more.
What? You have
rocks in your head?
No. I'm all clear.
Can't say the same
for Luc, though.
Sit down when
I am talking to you.
There's a goose with guts.
Now, go away and
do not come back
for 40 or 50 years!
Yes, Uncle Boris. Right away.
See you tomorrow.
Phew.
My, my. Boris, baby.
You weren't afraid
of those big, bad bears.
You are one loose goose.
Afraid of Muc and Luc?
They are just a c...
No, of course not.
What should a goose
fear from a bear?
We are more smart,
more bold...
And more cute.
So, big boy, what do
you say we do a little
flying together?
Say, around sunset?
Fly with you?
Is that a yes?
Uh... Wh...
See you then, hot stuff.
Oh! What have I done?
Balto! Balto!
Wake up. Eyes open.
What? What? What's up?
Repeat after me -
Boris, come right away.
It's an emergency.
What emergency?
No. Say like this -
Boris, come right away.
It's an emergency!
Now you go.
First tell me what's going on.
Is terrible. I'm
going on date with
gorgeous goose.
Now, that is scary.
And she's wanting
me to fly with her
but I do not fly.
Boris, you goof. Why
don't you just call it off?
I... I...
You're really hooked, aren't you?
Mmm-hmm.
Wow. She must be something.
Here is my plan. I go
on date, I charm Stella,
then you come,
get me before she
finds out I do not fly.
Is good, no?
Here's my plan.
You learn to fly.
Is terrible plan.
Why? What's wrong with it?
I already know how to fly.
You're kidding, right?
Not right.
You know how to fly?
Since when?
Look at me. I am bird.
All birds can fly.
You just came here
begging for my help
because you can't fly.
I do not fly. I did not
say I could not fly.
All right. I'll bite.
What's the deal here?
I'd give my eye teeth
to fly just once.
Why don't you?
The flying part is not hard.
It's where you go when you do it.
Psst!
I hate heights.
Wait a minute.
Are you saying that
you're afraid of heights?
No. Of course not.
Just a little.
Come on, Boris.
I have an idea.
Don't worry. This'll work.
Don't worry, he says. Ha!
There. What do you see?
Nothing. What do
you think I see?
Flap around like this
for a while and you'll
get used to the feel of flying.
Then you'll forget that
you're up in the air.
You know,
this makes sense,
in absurd,
illogical way.
Ah! Ahhh!
That's it! You're doing it.
You're doing great!
How does it feel?
Not bad, except I have
no idea where I'm going!
Keep going! Keep going!
Is working! Is working!
You got it. Now, open your eyes.
Ah! What do you know?
I am flying.
Ha-haaa!
I am one hot goose.
I'm not sure Stella's
gonna see it that way.
Hoo!
I am good.
I am the goose.
Duke, you
make a good argument.
Maybe we should
give it a try.
lt'll be an honor
to work for you and the
U.S. Mail, Mr. Conner.
OK, this is really
horrible. Devastating.
Besides that, give me
the particulars.
We gotta spread the word.
And what word would that be?
That the mail is
gonna be delivered by
that flying whatever.
The sled dogs are
through. Canned. Fired.
Out on their butts.
Unbelievable.
Dipsy, we're gonna have
to activate the E.D.A.S.
And what would that be?
Numbskull! The Emergency
Dog Alert System.
Ohhh. Oh, yeah.
Heh-heh-heh.
Oh!
Oh, now what?
We have to deliver the mail.
Dogs have always done it.
I don't know how to
do anything else.
If we don't deliver the mail,
who will want us?
Mr. Conner, there must
be something we can do
to keep delivering the mail.
The bush pilot
makes a good case.
It isn't fair.
It's not right.
We need our jobs.
We've always delivered...
What are they saying?
Tell us.
Is it good news, bad news, what?
OK. The mushers are
talking to Conner.
That's bad. That's gotta be bad.
And, he's saying
that airplanes are
faster than dogs.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Now he's saying air mail
is the wave of the future.
Oh! It's worse than I thought.
Hold on a minute. OK.
All right. This could
be interesting.
Oh, my. Oh! Um... Huh?
What the...? Whoa.
Yikes.
Oh, my.
What?
The postmaster's
agreed to a race
to see who's faster,
the bush plane or the dogs.
We're saved.
We'll beat the tail off
of that bush plane.
Are you crazy?
Have you seen how
fast that monster flies?
We can't afford to lose.
No kidding.
We need somebody
fast and experienced
to lead us in the race.
You can count on me.
What? What?
Well, Kirby, it's just...
We don't need fast,
we need really, really fast.
Oh?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're right.
The fastest dog in Nome.
The most famous dog in Nome.
My dad.
That's... Oh! That's good.
Now back. Stay down, brows.
Get bee wax, maybe make better.
Now I looking good.
Not good now.
Well, hi there, flyboy.
You're right on time.
I did not want to miss a minute with you.
Mmm, a goose
with intelligence.
Let's hit the skies, big boy.
Why rush things?
Let us take time
to be getting to know
each other first.
We can catch up in the air.
Flying really gets my feathers tingling.
Oh!
Wait, I am... I cannot... I have...
I have a crick in wing.
Ready?
No. I am meaning my other wing.
Ah! Ow! Oh! Ah...
Sit down, Boris.
Let me tell you something.
I've been around the pond
a time or two
I've done my share of migrating
When I look at you,
I enjoy the view
You set my little
wishbone to palpitating
Come on down, boys.
I'm a goose
On the loose
On the prowl for a handsome fowl
You've got the style,
got the form
Got the big strong wings
to keep me warm
I know what I like
-  And I like what I see
-
How'd you like to do
a little flying with me?
I ain't no quail
Wah-wah-ooh
You ain't no chicken
Wah-wah-wah-waaah
You've got my heart
doing more than ticking
I'd like to rest
against your chest
Aah-ooh
We could build ourselves a sugar nest
Oh, can't you feel
we've got some chemistry?
Don't you wanna try
a little flying with me?
Wah-wah-wah
Beak to beak
Wing to wing
Wah!
We could have ourselves quite a fling
Tail to tail, feather to feather
Don't you think
we oughta flock together?
Wah-wah wah-waaah
I'm the goose
Goose
With the juice
Juice
Wah-ooh
Mr. Gander, let's meander
On my own up here in Nome
I'm a chick who's
oh-so-far from home
Awww!
We could honk in harmony
Come on up and do
a little flying with me
Where the air is rare
And the wind blows free
Come on up and do a little...
Do a little
Come on up and do a little...
Flying with me
Let's you and I get
down and fly, flyboy.
Bye-bye!
Boris! Boris!
Huh?
It's an emergency.
Balto! It's about time.
Ah, is Balto. Always
in trouble, this dog.
If I'm not bailing him out,
then he is kaput.
Maybe we fly some other time.
But, but, but...
You must be the famous Stella.
And you must be the famous Balto.
The trouble dog.
Boris...
Come. We take care
of emergency. Come.
Goodbye, Stella!
Huh?
Bye... Boris.
Bravo, Balto. Magnificent.
Except for talking too much at end.
Hee-hee! We fooled her.
Boris, I wasn't faking it.
There really is an emergency.
A big race.
The mail dogs
against the bush plane.
Whoever wins
gets to deliver
the mail to Nome.
They want me
to lead the
dogsled team.
So what is problem?
I've chased that bush
plane. I can't beat it.
That could be problem.
We'll beat
that plane paws down,
now that you're lead dog.
Listen...
We're behind you 100 percent.
To the max!
If anyone can do it, you can.
Everyone, listen. I've seen it fly.
We have to consider the possibility...
Let's do the call!
Yes, this is good. Very good.
You think a bunch of dogs
can beat an airplane?
Of course not. Is impossible.
Oh. Thanks for the vote of confidence.
If you think we're
gonna lose, why
are you so happy?
Because I have solved
my Stella problem.
Oh.
Let me guess. You're
gonna tell her the truth.
Are you crazy?
Ah! Oy! The pain!
The pain! Oh!
An old migratory injury is back.
What migratory
injury? You've never
migrated anywhere.
What does it matter?
If I'm in pain,
I cannot fly, yes?
What are you
doing here? It's late.
I just thought I'd say hello.
You couldn't
wait until morning?
I thought you'd miss me too much.
Always. So, what's up?
With me? Nothing.
Uh-huh.
I don't know. It's just...
Well, you saw that
plane. It's so fast.
I can't...
There's no way
to keep up with it.
How can I look Kodi
in the eyes if we lose?
You're his father.
He loves you.
He knows me as
the town hero.
The great Balto
who saved Nome.
What happens when
I'm the same Balto
who loses the mail run?
Oh, Balto.
You don't have
to be a hero
You just have to be there
He doesn't need to
know you're perfect
He needs to know you care
And when the race is over
You've done all you can do
Be a father, not a hero
That's all he needs from you
You don't have to be a winner
If you give it your best
Believe in who you are
And then time can do the rest
Your heart is his example
Brave and strong and true
You don't have to be a hero
You just have to be you
Trust in your son
He's more than he seems
Like you, he can run
Like you, he has dreams
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Whatever happens, Balto,
you'll always be his hero.
Have faith in yourself, my love
Have faith in him too
He will always have a hero
He will always have a hero
For he'll always have you
It's OK, boy. I'm not
gonna hurt you.
Wait a minute, I saw you
this morning. Balto?
Heh. Heard a lot
about you, boy.
Quite a hero around here.
You saved a lot of lives
in that diphtheria scare.
I can't figure out how you
found your way back
here with the medicine.
That was some storm.
Come on. It's OK.
You seem to like
my plane, huh, boy?
I call her the Tundra Express.
Nothing can beat being up there,
soaring above the clouds, free.
More seeds, Boris?
Maybe just a few.
Is that better?
A little.
That must have
been some fight
you were in, hot stuff,
if you're still feeling it all these years later.
You've heard of bald eagle?
He wasn't bald till
I finished with him.
So, honey, what else
can I do to get you
back on your wings?
Well, I do have this itch.
Here?
Oh... oh...
Little to the left.
Here?
To the right.
How's this?
Heaven.
When you're better,
we can fly around.
Who knows what
could happen then?
Say, tomorrow?
The pain! Oh, the pain!
Oh, it's excruciating.
Ohh. Mmm.
Are you ready? I'm ready.
Are you ready? Cos I'm ready.
Something tells me
he's ready.
This is gonna be great, Dad.
Good luck, you two.
Luck? Ha! Like that
will make a difference.
Mr. Optimism.
That's why I like having you around.
Always a pleasure.
Why are you here,
anyway? I thought
you'd be with Stella.
Believe me, I'm going right away back.
Did she fall for that
ridiculous story of yours?
I have her eating out of wing.
Oh, oh, the pain!
I tell you, Balto,
I am having cake
and eating it too.
Uh, Boris...
Whoever called me
a silly goose will
eat his words.
- Boris!
- Stella is treating me like a king.
I just have to keep
this up for summer.
I am made in the shade.
I am a genius.
Ahh!
It is a miracle! I am
suddenly all better.
So, you're a big, fat liar.
You're just another
slick bird honking out
of both sides of his beak.
Stella, listen to me.
And make a bigger
fool of myself?
No. Your goose is
cooked.
Ouch. I-I can explain.
You don't know whole story.
Ow! No! Oh! Ooh!
Well, well, couldn't happen
to a nicer bird.
Have a good ride, flyboy.
Hey!
Hello! Anybody!
Here's your mail, Mr. Simpson.
Good luck to you.
Thanks, Mr. Conner.
Attention. Attention, everybody.
The U.S. Mail is now
aboard both the dogsled
and the bush plane.
The winner'll be the competitor
who is first to deliver
the mail safely to the
town of White Mountain
then returns to Nome
with the new bag of mail.
All right, everybody. On your mark,
get set...
Ha! Hey! Hey!
- Come on.
-
Come on.
Go! Go! Go!
Hey! Ow! Ahh!
Ooh! Ooh!
My toenail. It's killing me.
We gotta slow down.
Or not.
Kirby, you're pulling me again.
Me? You gotta be kidding.
Keep in line, boys.
You got it, Balto
All right,
everybody.
Move those feet.
Come on, everybody.
White Mountain. There it is.
Oh, no.
I don't believe it.
How'd he do that?
What are we gonna do now?
Hey, the race is only half over.
Don't give up now.
Ha! Hey!
Mail delivery, sir.
Thanks, Duke.
Here's the return batch.
Wait a minute. Hold the wire.
Where am I?
Oh!
Here's the mail from Nome, sir.
Thanks. Let's load you up
for the return trip.
White Mountain?
How did this disaster happen?
This mail goes right back to Nome.
Good luck to you.
Balto! Balto! Take me home!
No! No!
I am stuck in White Mountain.
I'm going to spend
the rest of my days
in White Mountain.
I'm going to die of boredom
in White Mountain.
I am...
Huh?
Going home!
Sled team already left.
What's your holdup?
Ice. Gotta get it off
the wings before I can fly.
Oh...
Aaah-oooh!
Oh, I wonder how far
they are by now?
Well, assuming they didn't get lost
or get attacked by bears
or Balto didn't break his leg
or the mail didn't fall out of the sled
or Kodi didn't barf or...
Never mind.
Look at what the dog dragged in.
Triple A, number one,
first quality beef jerky.
And did old Guntersson
see a thing?
Absolutely not.
You know, I am getting
so good, I scare
myself. Anyone?
Eat? At a time like this?
Go ahead, Dipsy.
Thanks.
I don't mind if I do.
I can't see my nose
in front of my face.
That's good. Cos it's ugly.
Very funny, wise guy.
What if we don't catch up? What if we lose?
That plane's gotta be
halfway to Nome by now.
Nobody quits on my team.
Nobody. Move, move, move!
Other reason I do not like to fly.
I'm about to lose my lunch.
Do you hear that?
The plane engine?
We're catching up.
I can't see it.
It's up there, all right.
And we're beating it.
Ahhh!
Whoa, there.
Come on, Dusty. You got it.
I'm OK.
Do you hear the plane
anymore, Dad?
No.
Where the heck am I?
Come on, baby.
Ohhh!
They should have
been back by now.
I knew it. They're in trouble.
Please, Mel,
don't get started.
The plane.
It's gonna win?
Oh, brother.
Well, where is it?
Wait. What happened?
Wait a minute.
That's the sawmill.
Not the plane?
Balto.
Balto!
They won!
They did it?
I don't believe it.
Easy, easy.
Did we beat the plane,
Mr. Conner?
Congratulations, Mr. Simpson.
You've done it.
You're the winners.
Yes!
Yeah, we beat
that plane. Kicked its tail.
Yeah! If this doesn't prove
us dogs rule...
what does?
Thanks for saving our jobs, Dad.
For the time being.
What do you mean?
I don't think that's
the last of the
bush planes, son.
Their day is coming.
How can you say that?
We beat him.
This time, Kodi.
But I've seen them.
We can't do this every time.
You're just wrong.
It's what I think.
You know how much
this job means to him.
Yeah, I know.
Where's Boris?
I thought Mr. Positive
would be here
celebrating with us.
Maybe he made up
with his new girlfriend.
Probably.
You know, I don't get it.
Duke should be here by now.
A little bad weather and
that yellow-bellied plane
flies south for winter.
He'll show up with his
tail between his wings.
I know what's wrong.
He's a sore loser.
What could be wrong?
We still have our jobs.
Yeah. Yeah, we do.
And we're gonna keep them.
Come on, let's go.
What are you doing
out here? The party's
on the beach.
I'm just wondering
what happened to Duke.
Are you really worried?
Balto! Balto!
It was awful. It was terrible.
Did I say it was awful?
There we were,
fishing the river, just minding
or own business when it...
attacked!
What attacked?
The monster.
Wait a minute. A monster?
We could barely see it through the fog
but we could hear it getting closer
and closer.
We didn't stick around
to introduce
ourselves. We bolted!
But it chased us,
growling and snarling,
until finally, it pounced
out of the sky.
If Luc hadn't yanked
me out of the way,
we would have been...
crushed.
Where's this... monster now?
Out there.
Stuck in the snow.
That's how we escaped.
It pounced out of the sky?
And the snarling,
was it really loud?
Loud? It was louder
than a wild-eyed grizzly.
The bush plane.
Ay! Ow! Oh!
I must get help.
Oh!
Balto,
you don't even know
the plane is out there.
Your sources are
a couple of mentally
challenged polar bears
talking about a monster.
Need I say more?
I just have a hunch.
It's worth finding out, right?
I don't get it. We won
the race, fair and square,
and now you want us
to help the enemy?
He's not the enemy.
He's a man. A nice one.
But Dad, he is the enemy.
He wants to take away our jobs.
It's not our fault
that plane's unreliable.
Not to mention
loud and smelly.
Yeah, kinda like
you, Ralphy boy.
This is serious.
That plane is out there
somewhere.
We're the only ones who can help.
That just proves our point.
The difference between
a dog and a machine
is dogs are tough and reliable.
I thought the difference
is only one has a heart.
I'm not gonna let Duke freeze to death.
Who's coming with me?
Kodi?
I don't even think he's out there.
But my job is to deliver the mail.
I'm sorry you see it that way.
Dad, wait.
Balto the trouble dog, right?
Hey, Stella. Sorry, but I'm kinda busy.
Tell Boris that I'll be gone for a while.
But Boris is why
I'm coming to see you.
Not that I'm interested
but did you see
the bum come back?
Come back? Where'd he go?
I thought he was with you.
Let's say he took
an unscheduled flight
on that bush plane.
Served him right, the stinker.
Boris was on the plane?
I saw him get packed
on myself. Don't ask.
Stella, I think...
Well, I think the plane crashed.
What?
As fast as you can, boys.
It's gonna be a cold night.
Er, you're positive when
we get back there
the monster won't get us?
Trust me.
I don't even know
why I'm going on
this rescue operation,
that lying, untrustworthy
ball of feathers.
- You know, he's nuts about you.
- Really?
Did he say something?
He only said that you
were more beautiful
than a wild rose
and more luminous
than the northern lights.
He didn't say that.
No, he didn't, but I know
it's what he thought.
And how do you
know so much?
I've known Boris
since I was a pup.
He may be a pain
in the butt but he's...
He's the dad I never had.
Yeah, a pain. That's
what he is, all right.
I wish I'd never
laid eyes on that
lying beak of his
or that little cute waddle
when he walks
or that feather that sticks out
in that funny way on
his neck, you know?
I was the one who
chased him onto that plane.
If anything happens to him,
I'll never forgive myself.
At this rate, we won't
get there till next spring.
Say, fellas, why don't you
tell me where the plane
went down so I can fly there?
Good idea.
Let's see. The frightening
monster ran amok at...
I mean, the bush plane
attacked us by Bear Claw Rock,
just past Falcon's Peak.
Got it. Bear Rock, Falcon's Peak.
Wish me luck, boys.
Good one, Luc.
Got beat by the spring snow.
There's gotta be soft patches all over the...
Would you look at that?
Stella's found them already.
She's better than I thought.
Bear Peak, Falcon Rock?
Whatever it was you told me,
I have no clue where I'm going.
I'm just here on vacation.
I guess that leaves you out
as our tour guide, then.
Come on. Let's get going.
Something's happened to the plane.
Let's send out a search party.
Where to look?
It could be anywhere.
Do you know how
much open territory
there is between us
and White Mountain?
No, but I bet you're gonna tell us.
Millions of miles.
They'll be looking for it for weeks.
Listen, if anyone can find him, Balto can.
Kodi?
Kodiak, come here.
Yeah, Mom.
I thought you went with your dad.
No, I didn't.
You mean your dad's out there alone?
Why didn't you go?
Well, I...
I don't know. I don't know
why he's even looking.
There is a man out
there, maybe dying.
We could have lost our jobs
because of that man.
You think your job is
worth more than a life?
I should have gone with Balto.
Do you think Uncle Boris is OK?
He's probably griping
about what's taking
us so long.
Come on, let's pick up the pace.
Right. Onward. Onward.
Oh!
Hmmm...
Their hearts are
in the right place.
They are kinda cute,
if you have a thing
for polar bears.
This is no time to be playing games.
Help! Stella!
Quick, grab my leg.
What was I thinking?
Hang on, Balto!
Muc! Luc!
Hang in there, boys.
There's got to be a way out.
I'll fly ahead and
look for something.
Hurry!
Reverse! Reverse!
Go the other way!
Trouble ahead?
Depends how you feel about waterfalls.
What are you trying to do?
Give me a stroke?
Because you did. That's it.
No more white water
adventures. No more.
It's a deal.
I ache in places I didn't know I had.
Come on, you sore
from that little run?
And you aren't?
Me?
Don't be ridiculous.
The big talker.
Hey-hey. Our newest teammate.
Listen, guys, I've been thinking.
Maybe the pilot really is lost.
Joining the other side?
Of course not.
I'm one of you. It's just...
Well... the
temperature's dropping.
He's just a human.
He could freeze to death.
So? He shoulda
thought of the risks
before he challenged
us to a race.
Yeah, but...
You're either with us or against us.
All I ever wanted
to do was be a
part of your team.
Bringing the mail
and supplies is
about helping everyone.
And when somebody
really needs our help,
we're sitting on our butts.
If this is what it means
to be a mail dog,
I'm not sure that's what I wanna be.
Any more, Balto?
Sorry, Stella.
So, now what?
Well, I think I know where we are.
Think? Why don't I like
the sound of that?
I know where
we are. Much too close
to moose territory.
You have a thing about mooses?
Everybody knows bull moose are mean.
Mean and stubborn.
And did I mention
those antlers?
Sharp and big.
Sharp and strong.
Ooh!
See how dangerous they are?
I'm guessing the river
pushed us past
Bear Rock.
I can't tell from here
how far we need
to backtrack.
Stella, can you take
a look around?
Bear Rock looks like...
well, a giant bear.
You don't say.
Back in a flash, fellas.
I see it! I see it!
I'm going over.
Boris...
Boris!
Where are you?
It's there. I saw it. The plane.
No sign of Boris.
Come on, let's go.
Through moose territory?
Luc says we're doomed
if we meet one
of those bull moose.
The faster we go in,
the faster we come out.
Come on.
You know, they
only have two moods -
angry and very angry.
Move those buns, fellas.
No.
Uncle Boris.
Look, we don't
want any trouble.
We're just
passing through.
You talkin' to me?
Our friend down
there might be hurt.
You talkin' to me?
We just wanna get by.
I just wanna know if
you're talkin' to me.
Here's a newsflash,
genius.
We're talking to you!
Whoa, whoa,
buddy, please.
This is an emergency.
We don't want
any trouble.
I think you're talkin' to me.
Now he gets it.
Pull, Luc. Pull harder.
You talkin' to me?
No. Course not.
Just talking amongst ourselves.
I think you're talkin' to me.
Ooh!
Balto, talk to me, honey.
Come on, sugar.
This isn't a good time
for a snooze.
Hey, lamebrain! >
You're standin'
on my turf.
You talkin' to me?
Am I here to amuse you?
You see any other
lamebrain moose here?
Yeah. I'm lookin' at one.
He's alive.
Boris?
Where are you?
Maybe he wasn't
on the plane after all.
But I could swear he...
Boris? Can you hear us?
Uncle Boris! Uncle Boris!
Flyboy?
Luc says he's found him.
No!
Boris. Boris.
Come on. Wake up.
Come on, big boy.
Don't you give up!
You owe me an apology!
What...? What...
What am I doing here?
Uncle Boris.
What? What?
All right, already.
I almost die once.
It was enough.
Easy does it, Luc.
Oh, the plane.
It was terrible.
Ahhh...
We'd better get him home.
What about the pilot?
Duke! You guys go on ahead.
But what about you?
It's getting cold out.
I'll be fine. Just
take care of Boris.
Come on, we're going to
take Uncle Boris home.
Balto?
What are you
doing here? How...?
How did you know?
Darn leg.
Guess I won't be
walking back to Nome.
No!
Hang in there, boy.
Now what?
Oh!
Kodi?
We heard you had
a special delivery for Nome.
Right on time, son.
Whoo! It is cold,
cold, cold, huh?
I don't know. Balto's
been gone a while.
Eight hours,
and counting.
Don't count him out.
Kodi.
I don't believe it!
Hallelujah!
Balto saved my life.
He and the other dogs.
Good dogs.
Good boy, Balto.
That's my team.
I can't believe it!
I knew he could do it.
I lost my appetite.
I still am not believing
you came looking for me.
Is it maybe because
you still like me?
Maybe.
Or maybe it's because
I had a few more things
to get off my chest.
I forgot to say
you were a rotten, lying,
good-for-nothing snow goose.
Wait, wait! Stella!
Bye, Boris.
It's been an education.
No, Stella, come back!
Do not go. Please. Stella!
Stella-a-a-a!
Now, that's more like it.
I... Well...
The truth is I am
a low-altitude flyer.
What are you talking about?
I hate heights.
That is why I lied to you.
That was the problem?
It wasn't me?
You?
What could be wrong with you?
You are perfect.
So you did notice.
Now, let me get this straight.
All this fuss was because
you don't like to fly?
No matter what I answer, I sound foolish.
Well, the way I see it,
having a grounded goose for a boyfriend
sure beats having a lying,
cheating, double-talking,
no good, high-flying,
fair-weather fowl...
Did you say boyfriend?
Among other things.
Stella...
Would you do me
the honor of joining me
for a little midnight swim?
Swimming at midnight?
I like it already.
Did Dad
tell you when he saw
you leading the others
it was one of the proudest
moments of his life?
Yeah, well, not
in so many words
but I got it.
Hey. Hey, there he is!
Living out a dream.
Nothing like it, huh, boy?
The wind across the water
A cloud across the skies
The music in the echo
Of the eagle as she cries
The winter land at sunset
The full moon on the rise
Everything, everything flies
A deer across the meadow
A rabbit on the run
The young colt with a flashing tail
Leaping for the sun
A million crystal snowflakes
Dance before your eyes
Everything, everything flies
Time and stars and innocence
Childhood's waking dream
The spark that leaves a dying fire
The trout that breaks the stream
A mother's prayers to heaven
A young boy's paper kite
The breeze that brings the morning
A comet through the night
Aurora borealis
As it sweeps across the skies
Everything, everything flies
The moment that we first appear
something in us sees
We tell the world with arms unfurled
Give me sky, give me wings
Oooh-ooh-ooh
When we lift a heart with goodness
or lend a helping hand
We share the load upon the road
Through despair and fragile lands
The things that keep us earthbound
Melt before our eyes
Everything, everything flies
Everything flies
Everything flies
Everything, everything flies
Everything flies
Everything flies...
