- It's over!.
- We did it!
- Wasn't it terrifying?
-  What a night!
Great Halloween,
everybody.
I believe it was
our most horrible yet.
Thank you, everyone.
No. Thanks
to you, Jack.
- Without your brilliant leadership--
- Not at all, Mayor.
You're such a scream, Jack!
You're a witch's
fondest dream.
You made walls fall, Jack.
"Walls fall"? You made
the very mountains crack, Jack.
- The deadly nightshade
you slipped me wore off, Sally.
- Let go.
- You're not ready for much excitement.
- Yes, I am.
- You're coming with me.
- No, I'm not!
Come back here,
you foolish--
Ow! Oh. Oh!
Ooh, Jack, you made
wounds ooze and flesh crawl.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Hold it!
We haven't given out the prizes yet.
Our first award
goes to the vampires...
for most blood drained
in a single evening.
Our second
and honorable mention...
goes to the fabulous
Dark Lagoon Leeches.
!!!!
Nice work, Bone Daddy.
Yeah, I guess so.
Just like last year.
And the year before that,
and the year before that.

!! There are few who deny!!
!! At what I do
I am the best!!
!! For my talents
are renowned far and wide!!
!! When it comes to surprises
in the moonlit night!!
!! I excel without ever
even trying!!
!! With the slightest
little effort!!
!! Of my ghostlike charms!!
!! I have seen grown men
give out a shriek!!
!! With a wave of my hand!!
!! And a well-placed moan!!
!! I have swept the very bravest
off their feet!!
!! Yet year after year
it's the same routine!!
!! And I grow so weary
of the sound of screams!!
!! And l, Jack
the Pumpkin King!!
!! Have grown so tired
of the same old thing!!
!! Oh, somewhere deep!!
!! Inside of these bones!!
!! An emptiness!!
!! Began to grow!!
!! There's something
out there!!
!! Far from my home!!
!! A longing that!!
!! I've never known!!
!! I'm the master of fright!!
!! And a demon of light!!
!! And I'll scare you
right out of your pants!!
!! To a guy in Kentucky
I'm Mr. Unlucky!!
!! And I'm known throughout
England and France!!
!! And since I am dead
I can take off my head!!
!! To recite Shakespearean
quotations!!
!! No animal nor man
can scream like I can!!
!! With the fury
of my recitations!!
!! But who here!!
!! Would ever understand!!
!! That the Pumpkin King
with the skeleton grin!!
!! Would tire of his crown
If they only understood!!
!! He'd give it all up
if he only could!!
-
-!! Oh, there's an empty!!
!! Place in my bones!!
!! That calls out for!!
!! Something unknown!!
!! The fame and praise!!
!! Come year after year!!
!! Does nothing for!!
!! These empty tears!!!!
Jack.
I know how you feel.
Sally.
You've come back.
- I had to.
- For this.
Yes.
Shall we, then?
That's twice this month you've
slipped deadly nightshade
into my tea and run off.
- Three times.
- You're mine, you know.
I made you
with my own hands.
You can make
other creations.
I'm restless.
I can't help it.
It's a phase, my dear.
It'll pass.
We need to be patient,
that's all.
But I don't want
to be patient.
No, Zero.
Not now.
I'm not in the mood.
All right.
Here you go, boy.
Mornin', gents.
-
-!!!!
!!!!
!!!!
Jack?
You home?
Jack, I've got the plans
for next Halloween.
I need to go over them with you
so we can get started.
Jack, please, I'm only
an elected official here.
I can't make decisions
by myself.
Jack!
Answer me!
-
- He's not home.
- Where is he?
- He hasn't been home all night.
Where are we?
It's someplace new.
What is this?
- Whoa!
-
Whoa!
!! What's this? What's this?
There's color everywhere!!
!! What's this
There's white things in the air!!
!! What's this? I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming!!
!! Wake up, Jack! This isn't fair
What's this!!
!! La-la-la-la-la-la-la!!
!! What's this, What's this
There's something very wrong!!
!! What's this, there's people
singing songs, what's this!!
!! The streets are lined with
little creatures laughing!!
!! Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy!!
!! What is this
What's this!!
!! There's children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads!!
!! They're busy building toys
And absolutely no one's dead!!
!! There's frost in every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes!!
!! And in my bones
I feel the warmth!!
!! That's coming
from inside!!
!! Oh, look, what's this
They're hanging mistletoe They kiss!!
!! Why, that looks so unique
lnspired!!
!! They're gathering around
to hear a story!!
!! Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this!!
!! What's this in here
They've got a little tree How queer!!
!! And who would ever think
And why!!
!! They're covering it
with tiny little things!!
!! They're covering it
with tiny little things!!
!! They've got electric
lights on strings!!
!! And there's a smile on everyone,
so now correct me if I'm wrong!!
!! This looks like fun
This looks like fun!!
!! Oh, could it be I got my wish
What's this!!
!! Oh my, what now
The children are asleep!!
!! But look
There's nothing underneath!!
!! No ghouls, no witches here to scream
and scare them or ensnare them!!
!! Only little cozy things!!
!! Secure inside
their dreamland!!
!! What's this!!
!! The monsters are all missing
and the nightmares can't be found!!
!! And in their place there seems
to be good feeling all around!!
!! Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air!!
!! The smell of cakes and pies
are absolutely everywhere!!
!! The sights, the sounds
They're everywhere and all around!!
!! I've never felt
so good before!!
!! This empty place
inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough!!
!! I want it Oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own!!
!! I've got to know, I've got to know
what is this place that I have found!!
!! What is this!!!!
Christmas Town?
- Hmm.
-
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hmm.
- This has never happened before.
- It's suspicious.
- It's peculiar.
- It's scary.
- Stand aside. Coming through.
-
We've got to find Jack!
There's only 365 days left
till next Halloween!
Is there anywhere
we've forgotten to check?
- I looked in every mausoleum.
- We opened the sarcophagi!
I tromped through
the pumpkin patch.
I peeked behind
the Cyclops' eye.
I did,
but he wasn't there.
It's time to sound
the alarms!
Frog's breath will
overpower any odor.
Oh!
Bitter!
Worm's wart. Wh-Where's
that worm's wart?
Sally!
Is that soup
ready yet?
Ah.
Coming!
Lunch!
Ah, what's that?
Worm's wart!
Mmm!
And frog's breath.
Wh-What's wrong?
I-I thought you
like frog's breath.
Nothing's more suspicious
than frog's breath.
Until you taste it,
I won't swallow a spoonful.
I'm not hungry.
Oops.
You want me to starve.
An old man like me,
who hardly has strength as it is.
Me, to whom you owe
your very life.
Oh, don't be silly.
Mmm! See?
Scrumptious!
Did anyone think
to dredge the lake?
This morning.
- Hear that? Shh.
- What?
-
- Zero!
Jack's back!
Y ea!
Jack's back!
Where have you been?
Call a town meeting
and I'll tell everyone all about it!
- When?
- lmmediately!
Town meeting!
Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!
-
-  Town meeting!
Town meeting
tonight!
-
-
Listen, everyone.
I want to tell you
about Christmas Town.
!! There were objects
so peculiar!!
!! They were not
to be believed!!
!! All around things
to tantalize my brain!!
!! It's a world unlike
anything I've ever seen!!
!! And as hard as I tried
I can't seem to describe!!
!! Like a most
improbable dream!!
!! But you must believe
when I tell you this!!
!! It's as real as my skull
and it does exist!!
Here, let me show you.
-
- Ooh!
!! This is a thing
called a present!!
-!! The whole thing starts with a box!!
-!! A box!!
-!! Is it steel!!
-!! Are there locks!!
-!! Is it filled with a pox!!
-!! A pox How delightful, a pox!!
If you please.
!! Just a box with
bright colored paper!!
!! And the whole thing's
topped with a bow!!
-!! A bow!!
-!! But why!!
-!! How ugly! What's in it!!
-!! What's in it!!
!! That's the point of the thing
Not to know!!
-!! It's a bat!!
-!! Will it bend!!
-!! It's a rat!!
-!! Will it break!!
!! Perhaps it's the head
that I found in the lake!!
!! Listen now
You don't understand!!
!! That's not the point
of Christmasland!!
!! Now pay attention!!
!! We pick up
an oversized sock!!
!! And hang it like this
on the wall!!
!! Oh, yes, does it
still have a foot!!
!! Let me see, let me look
Is it rotted and covered with gook!!
Um, let me explain.
!! There's no foot inside
but there's candy!!
!! Or sometimes it's filled
with small toys!!
-!! Small toys, do they bite
or explode in the sack!!
-!! Do they snap!!
!! Perhaps they just spring out
and scare girls and boys!!
!! What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun!!
!! I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once!!
!! Everyone, please
Now not so fast!!
!! There's something here
that you don't quite grasp!!
I don't know.
Do you get it?
Well, I may as well
give them what they want.
!! And the best I must confess
I have saved for the last!!
!! For the ruler
of this Christmasland!!
!! Is a fearsome king
with a deep, mighty voice!!
!! Least, that's what
I've come to understand!!
!! And I've also heard it told
that he's something to behold!!
!! Like a lobster
Huge and red!!
!! When he sets out to slay
with his rain gear on!!
!! Carting bulging sacks
with his big, great arms!!
!! That is,
so I've heard it said!!
!! And on a dark, cold night
Under full moonlight!!
!! He flies into a fog like
a vulture in the sky!!
!! And they call him!!
!! Sandy Claws!!
!! Well, at least
they're excited!!
!! But they don't
understand!!
!! That special kind
of feeling!!
!! In Christmasland!!!!
Oh, well.
Hmm.
Hmm.
There's got to be a logical way
to explain this Christmas thing.
You've poisoned me for the last time,
you wretched girl.
-
-
Oh, my head!
The door is open!
- Hello?
- Jack Skellington!
Up here, my boy.
Doctor, I need to borrow
some equipment.
Is that so?
Whatever for?
I'm conducting a series
of experiments.
How perfectly
marvelous.
- Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
- I know.
Come on into the lab
and we'll get you all fixed up.
Hmm.
Experiments?
Zero, I'm home.
Interesting reaction.
But what does it mean?
You can come out now
if you promise to behave.
Sally?
Sally?
- Oh! Gone again!
-
Hmm.
Oh!
!! Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack!!
!! Don't know if we're ever
going to get him back!!
!! He's all alone up there
Locked away inside!!
-!! Never says a word!!
-!! Hope he hasn't died!!
!! Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack!!
!! Christmastime
is buzzing in my skull!!
!! Will it let me be
I cannot tell!!
!! There's so many things
I cannot grasp!!
!! When I think I've got it
then at last!!
!! Through my bony fingers
it does slip!!
!! Like a snowflake
in a fiery grip!!
!! Something here I'm not quite getting,
though I try I keep forgetting!!
!! Like a memory
long since past!!
!! Here in an instant
Gone in a flash!!
!! What does it mean
What does it mean!!
!! In these little
bric-a-brac!!
!! A secret's waiting
to be cracked!!
!! These dolls and toys
confuse me so!!
!! Confound it all
I love it though!!
!! Simple objects
Nothing more!!
!! But something's hidden
through a door!!
!! Though I do not
have the key!!
!! Something's here
I cannot see!!
!! What does it mean
What does it mean!!
!! What does it mean!!
-
- Hmm. Hmm.
!! I've read these Christmas
books so many times!!
!! I know the stories
and I know the rhymes!!
!! I know the Christmas carols
all by heart!!
!! My skull's so full
It's tearing me apart!!
!! As often as I've read them
something's wrong!!
!! So hard to put
my bony finger on!!
!! Or perhaps it's really not as deep
as I've been led to think!!
!! Am I trying
much too hard!!
!! Of course, I've been
too close to see!!
!! The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me!!
!! It's simple really
Very clear!!
!! Like music drifting
in the air!!
!! Invisible
but everywhere!!
!! Just because
I cannot see it!!
!! Doesn't mean
I can't believe it!!
!! You know I think this Christmas thing
is not as tricky as it seems!!
!! And why should they have all the fun
It should belong to anyone!!
!! Not anyone, in fact
but me!!
!! Why, I can make
a Christmas tree!!
!! And there's no reason
I can find!!
!! I couldn't handle
Christmastime!!
!! I bet I could
improve it too!!
!! And that's exactly
what I'll do!!!!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
Eureka!
This year...
Christmas will be ours!
Patience, everyone.
Jack has a special job
for each of us.
- Dr. Finkelstein!
-
Your Christmas
assignment is ready.
Dr. Finkelstein, to
the front of the line.
What kind of noise is that
for a baby to make?
- Perhaps it can be improved?
-  No problem.
I knew it!
Doctor!
Thank you for coming.
We need
some of these.
Hmm.
Their construction
should be exceedingly simple, I think.
How horrible
our Christmas will be.
No!
How jolly!
Oh. How jolly
our Christmas will be.
- What are you doing here?
- Jack sent for us.
- Specifically.
- By name.
- Lock.
- Shock.
- Barrel.
Jack!
Jack!
It's Boogie's boys.
Ah, Halloween's finest
trick-or-treaters.
The job I have for you
is top secret.
It requires craft,
cunning, mischief.
And we thought you
didn't like us, Jack.
Absolutely no one is to know about it.
Not a soul!
Now...
...tree...
...Christmas Town...
-
- Ow! Hmm.
And one more thing.
Leave that no-account
Oogie Boogie out of this!
Whatever you say, Jack.
- Of course, Jack.
- Wouldn't dream of it, Jack.
!! Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws!!
-!! I want to do it!!
-!! Let's draw straws!!
-!! Jack said we should work together!!
-!! Three of a kind!!
-!! Birds of a feather!!
-!! Now and forever La la la la la la!!
!! La la-la la la-la
La la-la la-la!!
!! Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight!!
!! Throw away the key and then
turn off all the lights!!
!! First we're going to set some bait
inside a nasty trap and wait!!
!! When he comes a-sniffing we will
snap the trap and close the gate!!
!! Wait, I've got a better plan
to catch this big red lobster man!!
!! Let's pop him in a boiling pot and
when he's done we'll butter him up!!
!! Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box!!
!! Bury him for 90 years
Then see if he talks!!
!! Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man!!
!! Can take the whole thing
over then!!
!! He'll be so pleased
I do declare!!
!! That he will cook him rare
Whee!!
!! I say that we take a cannon
aim it at his door and then!!
!! Knock three times and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more!!
!! You're so stupid! Think now
if we blow him up to smithereens!!
!! We may lose some pieces and then
Jack will beat us black and green!!
!! Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag!!
!! Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad!!
!! Because Mr. Oogie Boogie
is the meanest guy around!!
!! If I were on his boogie list
I'd get out of town!!
!! He'll be so pleased
by our success!!
!! That he'll reward us too
I'll bet!!
!! Perhaps he'll make
his special brew!!
-!! Of snake and spider stew!!
- Mmm!
!! We're his little henchmen and
we take our job with pride!!
!! We do our best to please him
and stay on his good side!!
!! I wish my cohorts
weren't so dumb!!
-!! I'm not the dumb one!!
-!! You're no fun!!
-!! Shut up, I've got something
Listen now!!
-!! Make me!!
!! This one is real good
You'll see!!
!! We'll send a present
to his door!!
!! Upon there'll be
a note to read!!
!! Now in the box we'll wait and hide
until his curiosity!!
!! Entices him to look inside And then
we'll have him! One, two, three!!
!! Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick!!
!! Lock him up for 90 years
See what makes him tick!!
!! Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits!!
!! Mr. Oogie Boogie
is sure to get his kicks!!
!! Kidnap the Sandy Claws
See what we will see!!
!! Lock him in a cage
and then throw away!!
!! The key!!!!
Sandy Claws, huh?
It goes something
like this.
!!!!
How about it?
Think you can manage?
A-one and a-two
and a-three and a--
!!!!
Next!
Fantastic!
Now, why don't you all practice
on that? And we'll be in great shape.
Sally, I need your help
more than anyone's.
You certainly do, Jack.
I had the most terrible vision.
- That's splendid!
- No! It was about your Christmas.
- There was smoke and fire--
- That's not my Christmas!
My Christmas is filled
with laughter and joy...
and... this:.
my Sandy Claws outfit.
- I want you to make it.
- Jack,
- please listen to me.
It's going to be a disaster.
- How could it be?
Just follow the pattern.
This part's red. The trim is white.
- It's a mistake, Jack.
- Now, don't be modest.
Who else is clever enough
to make my Sandy Claws outfit?
-  Next!
- I have every confidence in you.
But it seems wrong
to me, very wrong.
- This device is called a nutcracker.
-
Jack, Jack!
We caught him! We got him!
Perfect!
Open it up, quickly.
-
-
That's not Sandy Claws.
- It isn't?
- Who is it?
-
- Bunny!
-
- Not Sandy Claws. Take him back!
- We followed your instructions.
- We went through the door.
Which door?
There's more than one!
Sandy Claws is behind
the door shaped like this.
- I told you!
-
-  You knock it off!
- Ow! Ow!
-
-
I'm very sorry for
the inconvenience, sir.
Take him home first!
And apologize again.
Be careful with Sandy Claws
when you fetch him.
- Treat him nicely.
-  Got it.
- We'll get it right...
-  next time!
You will be a decided
improvement...
over that
treacherous Sally.
Master! The plans!
Excellent, lgor.

Kathleen,
Bobby, Susie.
Y es, Susie's been nice.
Nice, nice, naughty, nice, nice, nice--
There are hardly any
naughty children this year.
-
- Now who could that be?
-  Trick or treat!
- Huh?
Ya!
You don't look like yourself, Jack.
Not at all.
Isn't that wonderful?
It couldn't be more wonderful!
- But you're the Pumpkin King.
- Not anymore.
-
- And I feel so much better now.
Jack, I know you think
something's missing, but--
- Ow!
- Sorry!
You're right.
Something is missing, but what?
I've got the beard,
the coat, the boots, the belt--
Jack! Jack!
This time we bagged him.
- This time we really did.
- He sure is big, Jack.
- And heavy!
- Let me out!
-
- Oh, Sandy Claws.
In person! What
a pleasure to meet you.
Wh-Why,
you have hands!
- You don't have claws at all.
- What?
-
-  Where am l?
Surprised, aren't you?
I knew you would be.
You don't need to have
another worry about Christmas this year.
- Wha-- Wh-Wha--
- Consider this a vacation,
Sandy, a reward.
It's your turn
to take it easy.
- B-But there must be some mistake.
- See that he's comfortable.
Just a second, fellas.
Of course!
- That's what I'm missing. Thanks.
- B-B-But--
You just can't-- Hold on!
Where are we going now?
Ho-ho-ho!
No.
- This is worse than
I thought, much worse.
-  Ho-ho-ho!
-  Ho-ho-ho!
- I know.
Me on vacation?
On Christmas Eve?
- Where are we taking him?
- Where?
To Oogie Boogie,
of course.
There isn't anywhere in the whole world
more comfortable than that.
- And Jack said to make him
comfortable, didn't he?
-  Yes, he did!
Haven't you heard of peace
on earth and good will toward men?
No!
Oh! This'll stop Jack.
What a joy
to think of...
all we'll have
in common.
We'll have
conversations...
worth having.
-  Don't do this!
-
Naughty children
never get any presents.
- I think he might be too big!
- Oooh!
No, he's not.
If he can go down a chimney,
he can fit...
down... here.
-
-
Well, well, well!
What have we here?
Sandy Claws, huh?

Hurray! It's Jack!
Think of us as you soar
triumphantly through the sky,
outshining every star:,
your silhouette,
a dark blot on the moon.
You, who are our pride.
You, who are our glory.
- You, who have frightened
millions into an early grave.
- Ow!
You, who have, uh,
devastated the, the souls
of the... Iiving?
- Oh, no! We can't take off in this.
-
- The reindeer can't see an inch
in front of their noses.
- Phew!
This fog's
as thick as, as--
- Jellied brains.
- Or thicker!
- There go all of my hopes,
-  Oh!
my precious plans,
my glorious dreams.
- There goes Christmas.
-
-
- No, Zero. Down, boy.
My, what a brilliant
nose you have.
The better
to light my way!
- To the head of the team, Zero.
-
- We're off!
-
Wait, Jack! No!
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ho!
Good-bye, Jack.
My dearest Jack.
Oh, how I hope
my premonition is wrong.
!! I sense there's something
in the wind!!
!! That feels like
tragedy's at hand!!
!! And though I'd like
to stand by him!!
!! Can't shake this feeling
that I have!!
!! The worst is
just around the bend!!
!! And does he notice!!
!! My feelings for him!!
!! And will he see!!
!! How much
he means to me!!
!! I think
it's not to be!!
!! What will become
of my dear friend!!
!! Where will his actions
lead us then!!
!! Although I'd like
to join the crowd!!
!! In their
enthusiastic cloud!!
!! Try as I may
it doesn't last!!
!! And will we ever!!
-!! End up together!!
-
!! No, I think not!!
!! It's never to become!!
!! For I am not
the one!!!!
Ho-ho-ho!
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
Santa!
Santa?
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?
- Uh, uh, uh, uh--
- That's all right.
I have a special present
for you anyway.
There you go, sonny.
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
And what did Santa
bring you, honey?
-
- Merry Christmas!
-
- Hello. Police.
-
- Attacked by Christmas toys?
That's strange. That's the second
toy complaint we've had.
Ho-ho-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Ho-ho-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-
- Huh?
-

You're welcome,
one and all!
Where'd you spot him?
Fast as we can, ma'am.
Police. I know, I know,
a skeleton. Keep calm.
Turn off all the lights. Make sure
the doors are locked. Hello. Police.
Reports are pouring in from all over
the globe that an impostor...
is shamelessly impersonating
Santa Claus, mocking and
mangling this joyous holiday.
Authorities assure us
that at this moment...
military units are mobilizing to stop
the perpetrator of this heinous crime.
- Jack. Someone has to help Jack.
-...wherever you are,
- Where'd they take that Sandy Claws?
- come back and save Christmas.
Look, Zero,
searchlights.
They're celebrating!
They're thanking us
for doing such a good job.
Whoa! Careful down there!
You almost hit us!
-
- It's okay, Zero!
-
- Head higher!
Are you a gamblin' man,
Sandy? Let's play!
-
- Hmm?
My, my!
What have we here?
Hmm.
I'll get you out of here.
Ah! Lovely.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle!
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle!
What? You try to make
a dupe out of me?
-
-
Who's next
on my list?
Ah, little Harry and Jordan.
Won't they be surprised?
- They're trying to hit us. Zero!
-
Merry Christmas
to all...
and to all
a good night!
I knew this Christmas
thing was a bad idea.
- I felt it in my gut.
-
Terrible news, folks!
The worst tragedy
of our times!
Jack has been blown
to smithereens!
Terrible, terrible news!
Attention.
Attention, citizens.
Terrible news.
There's still no sign
of Santa Claus.
Although the impostor
has been shot down,
it looks like Christmas will have to
be canceled this year.
I repeat, the impostor
has been shot down,
I repeat, the impostor
has been shot down,
but there's
still no sign of Santa.

poor old Jack!!
!! But I never intended
all this madness!!
!! Never!!
!! And nobody
really understood!!
!! Well, how could they!!
!! That all
I ever wanted!!
!! Was to bring them
something great!!
!! Why does nothing ever
turn out like it should!!
!! Well, what the heck!!
!! I went and did my best!!
!! And, by God
I really tasted!!
!! Something swell!!
!! Something swell!!
!! And for a moment
why, I even touched the sky!!
!! And at least I left
some stories they can tell I did!!
!! And for the first time since
I don't remember when!!
!! I felt just like
my old bony self again!!
!! And l, Jack!!
!! The Pumpkin King!!
!! That's right
I am the Pumpkin King!! Ha-ha-ha!
!! And I just can't wait
until next Halloween!!
!! 'Cause I've got
some new ideas!!
!! That will really
make them scream!!
!! And, by God, I'm really going
to give it all my might!!!!
Uh-oh. I hope
there's still time...
to set things right.
-  Sandy Claws.
- Hmm.
You wait till Jack
hears about this!
By the time he's through with you,
you'll be lucky if you--
The King of Halloween...
has been blown
to smithereens!
Skeleton Jack...
- is now a pile of dust!
-
-C'mon, Zero! Christmas isn't over yet.
-
What's that you said
about luck, rag doll?
-  Help! Help! Help!
-
-
- Shhh!
Seven!
It's Oogie's turn
to boogie now.
-
- One... two... three... four...
- five, six, seven.
-
This can't be happening.
Ashes to ashes,
and dust to dust.
Oh! I'm feeling weak...
with hunger!
One more roll of the dice oughta do it.
What?
Snake eyes?
Eleven!
Looks like I won
the jackpot!
Bye-bye, doll face...
and sandman!

J-J-J-Jack!
But they said you were dead.
You must be...

-
- Ooooh!
Jack, look out!
So long, Jack!

My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs!
Forgive me,
Mr. Claws.
- I'm afraid I've made
a terrible mess of your holiday.
- Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?
The next time you get the urge
to take over someone else's
holiday, I'd listen to her.
She's the only one who makes any sense
around this insane asylum!
- Skeletons, boogie men--
- I hope there's still time.
To fix Christmas?
Of course there is!
I'm Santa Claus!
He'll fix things, Jack.
He knows what to do.
- How did you get down here, Sally?
- Oh, l-I was trying to--
- Well, I wanted to, to--
- To help me.
- I couldn't let you just--
- Sally.
I can't believe I never
realized that you--
Jack! Jack!
- Here he is!
- Alive! Just like we said!
Grab ahold, my boy!
Whoa!
Good news, folks.
Santa Claus, the one and only,
has finally been spotted.
Old Saint Nick appears to be traveling
at supersonic speed.
He's setting things right,
bringing joy and cheer
wherever he goes.
Y es, Kriss Kringle has pulled it out
of the bag and delivered Christmas...
