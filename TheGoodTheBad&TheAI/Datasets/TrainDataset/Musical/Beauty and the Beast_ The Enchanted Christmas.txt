After an accident
caused my blindness...
It was like the end of my life.
But Mom used to try
to make me feel better...
by saying 'Now you're
a sleeping beauty in a forest. '
The right man, your Prince
Will awaken you.
And it's true, he's here for me!
Dong-gun?
What is this painting of?
One of the greatest paintings ever!
It's The Seascape in Hawaii' by A.
De Saint-Exupery.
With the crystal clear sky and
Pretty clouds above the horizon...
And the lush green grass
And exotic tropical trees...
I have just one word for that,
'dream place'...
Dong-gun is my eyes.
Through his eyes,
I see the sky and the sea...
and undisturbed grassland...
With him being with me,
I can be anywhere.
- Hae-joo
- When I need him
He's there for me out of nowhere.
He's everything I got.
You know why?
He's
literally a guiding light in my world.
And he completes me.
There's no reason
to lament for being blind.
You know what
the beauty of being blind is?
In my world, the others are blind...
That's why I'm
far from being miserable.
Watch out, a horrible
space beast is in front of you!
Hae-joo, come on.
It's raining pretty bad, huh?
Hae-joo, wait!
Your shoelaces are untied!
Hello!
Okay, it's done!
Hae-joo, what's going on?
Don't tell me the beast
implanted a memory chip...
Dong-gun!
I got an eye donor.
You know what that means!
I'll be able to see
the world with my eyes!
Hey, Dong-gun!
Dong-gun!
You screwed it up, focus!
I'm awfully sorry.
- Do it right, man!
- Okay, let's do it again!
Help me, Space Beast!
Good job, let's have
a lunch break.
Thanks a lot. Enjoy your lunch.
You're the greatest
beast dubbing artist ever!
I can see the beast in you!
I'm one of your biggest fans.
What's wrong with you?
It's about my girl friend,
who'll recover her sight.
I don't believe you got one,
in the first place.
Go to Sungbook-dong, driver.
It won't start, huh?
What a fateful moment!
That's how it started?
Somehow it appears so.
- Go to Itaewon, please.
- Okay, lady.
Sungbook-dong, please.
No problem, Miss.
- You work until late, huh?
- Yes.
Where to, Miss?
Let me guess, to Itaewon, right?
If you keep getting paid so low...
Obviously you're not a cab driver.
Damn, that's embarrassing!
I'll return it, a sure thing.
No, it was my fault
and let me treat you, please.
You returned my mobile phone
and treated me dinner!
Thank you very much!
It was my pleasure...
I was happy to be with you.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Hey, wait a moment!
I can't remember
the last time when I was this happy.
What a beautiful neighborhood!
Your shoelaces are untied
so dangerous.
I should've owned up earlier,
I am sorry about that...
Here you go.
Wait.
Hae-joo, I'm so sorry about that.
I didn't mean
to make you uncomfortable.
Just let me have a chance
to explain what I look like.
What can I say?
Why of all men Jun-ha
was the one?
TAK Jun-ha.
Who is he?
I've got one word
for this guy, 'perfect'
Every single girl
was crazy about him.
Oh, shit!
I've never seen such a handsome,
hot and great guy.
When I was lost, thinking about
what guy I should be for her...
Jun-ha is the guy for her.
He just deserves my angel
way more than I.
So she thinks you
look like Jun-ha?
What?
Hae-joo!
For her, I am the prince,
her eyes and everything...
under the one condition
that she's blind!
Never do I enjoy
her being blind, but...
How bittersweet!
I'm telling you,
she'll be disappointed to see...
this world that's not
always beautiful.
How should I take care of it?
What am I gonna do?
She'll even see
my gross and hideous face!
Oh, man, what should I do?
Hae-joo, open your eyes slowly.
Mom, it's you?
You're older than I thought!
And Dong-gun, he isn't here yet?
Who is Dong-gun?
The guy who gives her a ride
to work and back home every day.
How come I haven't
even seen him once?
No one did! Anyway he'll
be here, so we'll see him.
I'm sure he's a hot
and handsome stud.
So handsome that people
think he's had plastic surgery!
Dong-gun?
Dong-gun!
Dong-gun!
Who are you?
Hello, I am, Jung-suk,
a friend of Dong-gun.
He is on an urgent business trip,
so I am here for him.
You all look like
scared stiff, sorry.
Who did you say you are?
Congratulations!
Who are you?
Dong-gun, I can see everything!
Don't tell me you didn't know
whom I want to see now!
When will be here?
Too noisy, Hello?
Die, you stupid monster beast!
Wait!
Cut!
Cut!
I said cut, dumb ass!
- You're nuts?
- I am really sorry.
I can't take your shit any more.
Let's have a break.
- Let me give it one more try!
- No way!
- Let's have a break.
- Oh, please.
You must be better than that!
I'm really sorry.
Dong-gun, what's
the matter with you?
Something wrong with Hae-joo?
Jung-suk, just be honest,
do I look that terrible?
Do my looks scare you off?
- You look handsome to me.
- Are you sure?
Then how come everybody
reacted as if I was a monster?
What did Hae-joo say
when she saw you in person?
She didn't recognize it was me.
You didn't tell her?
I was so petrified that
I pretended not to be me.
Why not?
I made up a lie
about my looks, being stunning...
Is that why you didn't
tell her the truth?
Come on, this is good timing.
Being blind, she had no idea
what it means to be handsome!
She is so innocent
in that subject.
Just let her get used to your looks
and believe you're handsome...
You have no time
for crying out of self-pity, you ass!
Just call her.
- Does it work?
- Sure.
Move your ass
and make her your girl!
You lose this crucial moment,
you'll lose her forever!
In case any hot son of a bitch
makes his move on her...
this game is over
for you, period!
Okay, you can join
the others for lunch.
Call her.
His plan does work?
Probably it will.
Could be possible.
Dong-gun, how come didn't call me,
nor answer your phone?
It's torturing me,
not seeing you now!
So you're okay?
You can see everything?
Sure I can,
when the hell will you be here?
Tell me when!
Well... soon.
Did you like my present flowers?
Aren't they like you imagined?
Sorry I just sent Jung-suk for me.
But he does look nice and handsome, huh?
No kidding! He was horrible!
All my family were frightened to death!
Dong-gun, Hello?
Plastic surgery for all these?
Trust me, that's a death wish.
Let me see.
You look okay, why bother
to change your looks?
My advice, just get rid of the scar.
- Will it make me look better?
- Much better!
You'll be proud of how you look!
How long will it take
to get rid of the mark?
No ER case for this?
I see, then...
Including the surgery and recovery...
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks?
Dong-gun, you didn't
get any of my calls?
Call me back as soon as you get
this message. It's Hae-joo!
You crossed the damn line!
I'll kill you!
Answer the phone before I lose it!
You know what you got to do, right?
Here, honey!
Honey!
Here.
steps and turn left...
The 12th floor and the 15th door.
The toilet is broken again!
It sucks!
Hey, you must be Jung-suk!
You got any idea
where Dong-gun is?
I mean Dong-gun, your friend!
Well... let me think.
Where could he be?
Maybe, probably...
- He's in Hawaii.
- Hawaii? Why?
As I told you before...
He's on a business trip,
as a dubbing artist for a beast.
I don't get it.
He didn't say a word to me...
Hae-joo, don't cry.
He'll be back soon, trust me.
He didn't see it coming,
it was hustle and bustle.
I can tell it was
too hectic to call you.
How else would
I have his mobile phone!
Hello, that's right.
Dong-gun is in Hawaii!
Hawaii?
Hae-joo!
He'll be here soon.
He said he's going to give
you a great birthday gift.
That's his plan!
Good bye.
Hae-joo, Dong-gun sent you a postcard!
- It's from Hawaii?
- Really?
- Let me...
- No, this one!
Okay, I will!
Hae-joo, how much
I want to be with you now!
What a twist of fate is it that...
I'm this far away from you now.
Even on a positive note...
that Hawaii is so beautiful...
I am not as happy as
the others here 'cause...
you're not here.
Be patient, sweetheart,
I'll give you the greatest gift
for your birthday
But I think it's fair for you
to do something for me.
I want you to write me postcards, too.
You don't know
how much I want to hear you.
But I'll send you postcards
instead of calling you...
until you learn to write.
It'll take 2 weeks for you
to learn to write.
I'll be there by the time
you've done your homework!
Hae-joo!
You can see, can't you?
You see me, too? Oh my god!
It's unbelievable!
Hey, guys!
Hae-joo, please!
Swing'!
I can read!
I did homework!
Come back, Dong-gun!
Dong-gun!
Dong-gun!
You're a lazy boy!
I missed you so much!
Who the hell are you?
You know her?
Mr. TAK, hurry, we're losing them!
Sons of bitches!
You just stop right now, you assholes!
Don't be so mean!
You bastards!
Look what the dirty pigs did!
It hurts.
Get in there you scum!
Move your asses!
Hey, Miss, where are you going?
Well...
I have no idea how to get home!
Get in, I'll give you a ride.
What?
Something on my face?
No.
What do the Chinese characters mean?
The 3rd dragon
It's like the 'ABC' of the alphabet!
Don't be so harsh,
I didn't learn Chinese yet!
Whatever.
Mister, someone must
have scribbled on your arm.
Shall I erase it for you?
It means I'm the number 3
of the Dragon Gang!
Mr. 1st Dragon, Mr. 2nd
Dragon, I'm the 3rd and...
Shut the hell up, you bastard!
How the hell you laugh!
Wait.
Use this handkerchief
or it'll get infected!
- Goodbye, Dragons!
- Good night, angel!
- Thank you for the ride.
- My pleasure.
Are you okay?
You must've been frightened!
I'm okay, it's not the first time
I got in the wrong car...
I see.
Wait!
Let me see...
Your shoelaces are untied!
So dangerous!
Why are you looking at me?
I see. I look like your
dead boyfriend, don't I?
He's not dead!
Get your hands off me!
Just wait. Let me finish this up.
Sorry, I didn't mean it!
It just happened!
Hello, everybody.
Good night!
I went in the wrong direction.
Tell me, is that Dong-gun?
- No!
- That's gotta be Dong-gun!
Invite him in!
We want to say hello to him!
How funny it is to make
such a ridiculous mistake!
I saw a man who looks like
the way I imagined you are!
To begin with, I was stupid
to think you are in Seoul!
Well, I take the stupid part back.
Let me see.
What?
It worked out great.
The surgery came out great!
Oh, great!
- Let me look at myself in the mirror.
- No, not yet.
Don't take away this bandage
until I tell you to.
- The hideous thing goes forever?
- No, it was never here!
Thank you, doctor, I feel reborn.
Miss JANG Hae-joo, come with me.
What? Go where?
I did nothing wrong.
This is where you wanted to go?
What, you want to go to police station?
You're blocking the screen!
You're the last person
I want to be with now!
- Son of a bitch...
- Bastard!
Excuse me. I'm outta here.
You can eat mine, too.
Be a good girl. It's a bad habit
not to finish your meal!
Okay, I'll eat this,
you're taking me home!
Sure, just finish this first.
How nice to have this meal!
Do you like it?
Let me ask you something.
Your dead boyfriend...
How long had you been with him?
It's not funny any more!
He's very much alive!
He'll be back from Hawaii soon!
How about this?
I'll be your temporary boyfriend!
What? It's not bad, is it?
Mr. Prosecutor,
please do your real job!
You didn't read the newspaper?
I nailed the Dragon Gang!
You watched it all!
- Stupid jerk.
- Dirty pig.
Oh, Hae-joo, What's your favorite?
Just go home!
Wait!
I'm Do-shik, number 17
of the Dragon Gang!
And you?
- What?
- Tell me who you work for.
I work for Toonibus Station!
Tune-a-bus Station'?
Never heard of it.
Tune-a-bus'... then
you deal with vehicles?
What's your role
in the syndicate?
I'm here to get revenge on
TAK Jun-ha, and you're, too?
TAK, that son of a bitch,
is a dirty and sneaky dog.
And fucking mannerless to my boss!
This is what I'm gonna do,
'knock him off, 'delete' him!
I'm psyched up
just thinking about it.
Hey, this is it! Let's do it.
You!
You... are my sunshine
my only sunshine...
You called me?
- Nah, man.
- Are you messing with me?
We've met before, right?
Aren't you KOO Dong-gun?!
Long time no see!
How have you been?
I think I should be okay.
Oh, goddess of fate,
you are so cruel...
Of all the men...
You sent Jun-ha to... Hae-joo!
I feel so sympathetic for you.
We've got the same enemy.
Let's 'delete' him clean.
For my family, and
for your 'would-be' family!
As a team, we can do this
easy and clean.
- Don't leave me behind.
- Taxi!
Hey, Tune-a-bus!
What a timid boy!
Hae-joo, how have you been?
In Hawaii, a prosecutor is
the worst choice for a boyfriend,
Cause in Hawaii, people are
so nice and kind that...
there is no work for prosecutors.
Only the 'dumb and dumber'
apply for prosecutor jobs.
The worst part is that they
break the law by themselves!
Give it back to me.
- I said, give it back to me!
- No, sir.
You damned stubborn pig!
I'll make you regret that!
Help! He's killing me.
Hae-joo, where are you going?
How lucky I should see you here!
Get in!
I'll give you a special ride
in a more than special car.
Get in, Hae-joo!
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor!
Look what you're doing,
like a brainless thug!
I see why prosecutors
have such a bad rep in Hawaii.
It's so obvious!
What? Hawaiian thug?
Hae-joo, let's make the best
use of this damn patrol car.
With a siren on top,
we'll get there fast and safe!
Stay away from me,
or I'll call the police.
I work for the police!
Help! He's killing me!
Dong-gun... hurry!
Okay, let me see.
What?
Don't panic! This is just a small
side effect of the anesthesia.
Let me take a mirror!
Oh, God!
Just one week is enough
to get your brows back!
Are you sure?
Hae-joo, I am sorry to say this...
It's unexpected, but I've got
to work one more week here...
What?
Dong-gun, don't be sorry.
I know you're stuck with work.
But I miss you so much.
It's weird that I can feel you
only with my eyes closed...
The moment,
I open my eyes,
you're not with me any more!
What an irony of fate!
My heart has never hurt
like this before.
I feel like my best friend has gone
the moment my eyes are opened.
I don't even have a photo
to remember you by!
If I do, I could see and
feel you in the photo.
Oh, God, can't you give
me anything to feel him by?
Excuse me.
Where do you have
the painting of Hawaii?
Sorry, but we don't have any.
Hae-joo, you don't
have an umbrella, do you?
Hae-joo...
I cant' bear to see
the shit going on there!
They are becoming horny.
Your game is almost over.
Can you believe this jerk
has almost won her heart?
You need this?
- Damn, that thing's scary!
- You don't like it?
How about this?
You need a much bigger one?
Look at the jerk and your girl!
They're going away!
My handkerchief?
I had a grueling fight
with that jerk to get it back.
The pig made frantic
attempts not to let it go.
I gave this to him!
Why did you take it back?
Not to the worst tempered
shit head of a criminal ever!
You still don't get it yet?
It's me that you
should sympathize with!
I was hurt trying to get
the criminals!
It hurts so much.
Hey, easy! Ouch...
Thank you for the ride.
I've been dry and safe.
You have no idea
how happy I am to do this!
- And I'll be there for you tomorrow.
- No, thank you.
You'd better stop this.
Hae-joo, you don't have
the slightest idea why I do this?
It's tougher than nailing criminals.
You don't like my weapons so...
I worked hard to get you this.
- What the hell is this again?
- Accidental death!
Don't you know how to 'think'?
If a prosecutor is run over by this,
it's called an accident, right?
What a brainless crap!
Just stay away,
I am in trouble already!
You really want to kill someone?
You're nuts!
Oh my, they're doing it!
Look, they are kissing!
Their tongues are moving!
Now where's your
'be moral' attitude?
You said it's brainless crap!
Calm down?
What's it with you!
You should kill TAK, not me!
What?
Hae-joo!
Sorry about this!
No need to be.
You were so miserable, that's why.
But at least we learned something.
The 'speeding cart
murder op' is too dangerous.
Cut the revenge crap!
What are you talking about?
You sit and watch your girl fall for him?
You know what?
Honesty is the best policy.
When I get rid of the bandage,
I'll tell her everything.
What a sappy, goofy idea!
Don't tell me you have
any chance against him!
Finish him off! Delete him ever,
there's no other way!
Delete what?
Is he a file or something?
Please cut the stupid crap!
Screw your 'knock off
'delete', whatever!
You have no brains or guts
to confront him!
Anyway I'll be promoted
to the 2nd Dragon!
I could guess.
Hey, Jun-ha!
- So happy to see you again!
- So am I.
Last time I was too busy
to have a long talk.
Today, let's go get some drinks
or something, buddy.
But I have an appointment...
No, not drinks,
we should have dinner first!
Hey, Jun-ha, hi again!
What's up?
- Hi, Dong-gun.
- How are you doing?
There's a good restaurant.
Let's have lunch, dinner, whatever!
- I'm not hungry at all!
- Yes, you are!
Jun-ha, wait!
Jun-ha, again, hi!
I couldn't wait to see you.
- You must be hungry.
- No, not at all.
Please come with me,
I got something to tell you.
Hey, one more bottle of this please.
Down as much as you can,
but we're going Dutch!
Let's drink until one of us falls.
Can I borrow that bottle?
Oh, water!
No!
Not a chance!
You don't get me this time
forget it!
No!
NO!
This leech nearly got me again!
Hey, give me some water!
Hae-joo!
Hae-joo!
She's playing the piano
with her eyes closed?
* I can see you but like
in the mist.
* The moment I touch you,
you move back.
Hey, our enemy is playing
disgusting romantic crap!
He sings in a 'cool guy'
seducing way!
I bet, they'll do it tonight, period!
* I can see you,
but like in a mist.
* The moment I touch you,
you move back.
You need this
Hit and run. You got it?
I'll let the power down.
The power company
screws up my song!
Hae-joo!
How stupid I was to do
the ass's 'hit and run' crap!
Dong-gun?
Dong-gun?
Hunt for any of the Dragon rats.
Give me a call.
I'll be waiting.
Hae-joo, you'll be all right.
Get some sleep.
Jun-ha...
You're a great guy.
Totally different from
the prosecutors in Hawaii!
How embarrassing!
Dong-gun, where are you?
Who are you?
Hae-joo, I am Dong-gun.
You can't be Dong-gun!
I want you to understand
why I had to run away
Sorry, Hae-joo.
- 'Dong-gun! '
- 'Huh? '
It's not your looks but your soul
that I am in love with.
Hae-joo, your true love freed me
from a long spell and curse.
Dong-gun, you look so cool!
I love you.
Eat this, love is patient
but your stomach is not.
You don't know when to quit!
Don't get mad at me!
I can't believe this!
It's just one of the few cases,
a nasty bit of tough luck!
I hope this will help
to relieve your feelings!
NO!
Are you a quack or something?
I looked just monstrous before,
now I'm whacky psycho!
NO!
You need more brown?
What should be the 3rd excuse?
Look!
Thank you, Jun-ha.
Is your boyfriend still alive?
Not dead yet?
What is he like?
- He's a space beast.
- Pardon?
No kidding! Then you
went out with a beast?
My self-pride hurts,
I'm a loser against a beast?
Don't take it wrong.
You're a great guy.
It's his nickname, I like the growling
beast sounds he makes.
That's all?
Then let me beat him.
If I make a better beast sound,
I win your heart, right?
Trust me, this is my game.
Sorry, that's a dog bark.
I'm laughing so hard
it's making me cry.
I can feel the unavoidable
chemistry they share!
Dong-gun, what should you do?
Hello.
- Wait a moment, Hae-joo.
- For me?
Hello.
Dong-gun!
Where are you now?
I was taken to an ER.
Some mad jerk threw
a bottle and I was hurt!
I don't know what shit
was in his head, damn!
You're still in Hawaii?
Come to see me!
So sorry but I can't
come back to you,
I changed my mind!
Hot chicks on the beach
are going nuts for me!
No man would leave so many chicks
behind for just one so-so girl.
You think I'm a jackass!
I'm not just saying
this is exciting but...
I'm seriously thinking of
marrying one of the babes here.
I'm sick of the 'soul mate' love shit,
so you find someone else.
If you need my advice,
a public prosecutor is an option.
What about a honeymoon in Hawaii!
Good bye.
Hello!
What?
I'm going to Hawaii!
Hae-joo!
Mom, don't worry, it won't take long.
Hae-joo!
This jerk's got me infuriated!
Jun-ha!
You're here to grab me for
lunch, dinner whatever!
- How have you been?
- Good.
How is it going with the girl?
With Hae-joo?
I don't know...
but it's tough.
She doesn't know
how much I feel for her.
You must be
way deep in love with her!
You know what drives me crazy?
I don't think I can compete
against her boyfriend.
She's as firm as a rock.
I bet you deserve her better.
Just keep caring for her,
and she'll turn to you.
You're such a great guy!
And you two are meant
for each other.
You feel so weird!
I'm honored to treat
a messenger of love!
What do you like to eat?
How about Chinese noodles?
How about a rain check for that?
Why don't you see her now!
- I'm in a hurry.
- Where are you going?
Hawaii? You just
came back from there!
Tell me, why Hawaii again?
Jung-suk, there's a visitor
for you in the lobby.
You're here for me?
I'm Jung-suk.
You're... Jung-suk?
Sure... I am.
Dong-gun, well...
where could he be?
He's probably in Hawaii!
I'm Jung-suk, Dong-gun's friend.
He is on an urgent business trip,
so I am here for him.
What?
Hey, Miss, your passport, please.
Sorry, but I don't have one,
but I should go in there!
It's an emergency.
Sorry, but you're not
allowed in without a passport.
I said an emergency.
Are you deaf or something?
Come this way,
we need to investigate this.
I've been waiting this long!
Come this way, come on!
Amazonian strength
out of this small girl!
- You're such a blockhead!
- This way!
Dong-gun!
Miss, stop there.
Dong-gun!
I'm begging you,
Just give me 5 minutes.
What the hell!
Whatever story you got,
better not make a fuss.
Hey, Miss!
Can I go to the restroom
for a minute?
I swear, the man on the photo is me!
- Do I look so different?
- Totally different!
What a scum!
Don't think this cheap
forged passport would work!
I swear, I am a good citizen!
Look at me, I admit
I altered the photo a bit.
And ID number,
KOO Dong-gun!
I'm being wrongfully accused!
Hae-joo, what are you doing here?
- What's this mess about?
- You wanna get beaten?
Hey, you son of a bitch!
Don't tell me you don't know
how much I miss you!
Why are you doing this shit!
You're not here for fun!
Sorry but I don't get it,
Hae-joo.
I am Jung-suk.
- KOO Dong-gun!
- Yes, sir!
- Here fingerprint!
- Right.
Hae-joo, why are you
being held at the airport?
Hey, Dong-gun!
What's up?
Waiting for your plane?
You're going on a trip, right?
You and I never stop
meeting by accident!
Hae-joo, this is Dong-gun,
my high school friend.
I met him 2 weeks ago,
the first time since high school.
Say hello.
This is Dong-gun.
This is Hae-joo, she's pretty, right?
Say hello.
Nice to meet you, Hae-joo.
Jun-ha is a really great guy.
He can make you happy.
- What?
- Dong-gun!
So you're running away, chicken!
You're okay not seeing me forever?
You dirty coward!
So you didn't want to see me?
Stupid son of a bitch!
You worthless shit!
You're not the Dong-gun
I've been in love with.
He is a man of his word,
and will be with me...
as he promised...
A chicken like you,
is not my boy friend!
You've met before?
Let me go!
You're not brave enough to look at me?
Don't pretend to be Dong-gun,
he's not such a loser!
Even if Dong-gun felt
for some other girl...
He wouldn't sneak away
like you do.
Just get away!
I won't see you again.
Hae-joo!
Hae-joo...
Happy birthday to you.
Wait, Hae-joo!
Jun-ha, 'mother-four-Q'!
What a jerk!
Take it easy.
Good night.
Wait!
TAK Jun-ha, you filthy pig.
You dirty dog!
Who's this sucker!
Go to hell!
Where is he?
What are you doing?
The mail carrier
just came right?
- What's that?
- What's what?
- You're hiding something.
- Hiding what?
I'm a man of law and order,
a prosecutor.
See, I am clean.
It's not funny,
give me what you're hiding.
In this hand?
It's clean.
Credit the beauty
of trusting someone!
Okay, I don't mind, whatever.
Here, the electricity bill is so big!
Join the energy saving movement!
Hae-joo, give me
the pleasure of driving you,
I had my car washed for you.
Dong-gun, I love you!
They're the first words I learned.
Damn!
All this just sucks. I can't stand it!
Sir, calm down.
What makes you so happy?
Hae-joo, the beauty &
Dong-gun, the ugliest beast ever
Hae-joo!
You're okay with everything?
Such as?
Your shoe laces won't get loose?
Dong-gun, I love you.
They're the first words I learned.
Sorry about Hae-joo,
but I can't do this any more.
Jun-ha, son of a bitch!
- Let me go!
- You're not allowed!
Let him in!
Hands off!
Is this what you wrote?
Did you mean it?
Long time no see.
Just explain to me,
what's going on with Hae-joo?
It's true and correct,
she's losing her eyesight.
What's worse, another
transplant is not possible.
So, you broke up with her
'cause she's going blind?
You two-faced sneaky pig!
If Hae-joo's going blind again,
she needs you more than ever!
To be up front,
I don't think I can do that.
I've got to think about my career...
So if Hae-joo goes blind...
She'd be too much a burden
for me to carry.
You son of a bitch!
You don't deserve a bit of her love!
- Hae-joo, good job.
- Thanks a lot.
See you tomorrow.
Hae-joo...
Hae-joo, you don't see me?
What a monstrous twist of fate!
I'm so sorry.
I'm the one to blame for this!
I'm so sorry!
Please accept my apology!
I am awfully sorry, Hae-joo.
Who are you?
I'm KOO Dong-gun.
You don't remember my voice?
What are you talking about?
I don't know you!
Just get off the stage.
Oh, Hae-joo.
You should've begged more, idiot!
Oh my God,
my eyes hurt like hell!
- Are you alright?
- Hands off, don't do silly things.
I am Dong-gun, your boy friend, ex...
Why are you doing this to me?
Dong-gun dumped me and
ran away to Hawaii, or wherever.
Hae-joo, I didn't dump you, but...
I didn't mean it. I don't
even know where to start!
The bottom line is
I'm back home, to you!
You like the space beast, right?
It's back for you.
Oh, princess Hae-joo,
forgive me just once!
Now I see what the beast sound
is like!
I don't want to hear anymore.
The moment I can see again,
you'll run away!
That's never gonna happen.
I didn't mean to
hurt you or something.
I just thought Jun-ha
could make you happy.
And Dragon Gang guy
ruined everything...
I even saw a plastic surgeon
to look better, but...
When did you get this mark?
- When I was a kid...
- Did it hurt?
You can see me?
You idiot!
I miss you so much!
Why do you think
I wanted eye surgery?
I wanted to see you smile and cry and...
In that way, I want you in my life.
I'd stop loving you
if I found you weren't handsome?
I love you whether
it's a dark or bright world.
So just be with me,
whether you're a beast or a prince.
Oh, Dong-gun!
Do you like my looks anyway?
You're the cutest beast ever!
TAK Jun-ha!
Mercifully I'll spare you your life.
In return for that...
Send her back to my friend.
I know every piece of shit about you!
He even knows about
the attempted cart murder!
Ready to join your buddies
in the big house!
