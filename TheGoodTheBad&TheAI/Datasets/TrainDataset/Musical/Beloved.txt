Want to try another size?
-Yes.
Here's the left foot,
would you like to try it.
We also have a 36.
and now
I'm going to walk
I'm closing, Madeleine.
Yes!
Goodbye.
Do you have a bad back,
Madeleine?
No.
That's 50 000 in old Francs.
Where shall we go?
Are you staying at a hotel?
No, I live over there.
If Roger Vivier had not
designed shoes
for Christian Dior, my mother
would never have been a whore
I like the word whore.
It adds to the story of
my parents.
The mother never said that word.
She says it was just something she did occasionally.
She was always
in formal employment.
That prostitution was
extra money.
Good morning, Madeleine.
Good morning, Mrs. Menant.
Mme. Menant.
That night as they
went up the stairs
My mother figured her
potential turnover.
Counted all the shoes
and dresses that she'd be able to buy.
Even today she's not
afraid to say ...
without Roger Vivier, she would
most certainly have become a thief.
I think she's in a way
convinced that
prostitution saved her from prison.
Are you Madeleine?
Yes.
A friend gave me your address.
You can ...
do you ... make love ... with you?
It's possible if you have money.
Well .. I've got this.
Come with me.
Are you okay?
It's just a little tickle.
Tickle?
In my throat ...
Cough ...
-Not here. Are you crazy?
-No. I am a doctor.
Cough-again, please.
-No, no ...
I don't do weird things,
please go
I don't want to do weird things.
I'm really a doctor.
Cough.
Again.
Come.
So, this is Marie Dominique.
-Nice to meet you!
-Good morning.
And hidden behind her officer
is Odette.
-Nice to meet you.
Shall I introduce myself?
François Gouriot.
François.
Danielle, you already know.
Yes.
You look very elegant today, Danielle.
Thank you.
-And my boss, Ms. Rivier.
-Good morning.
-My compliments.
And this is the Jaromil.
He comes from Czechoslovakia.
But he's not a communist,
he's a doctor.
An Endocrinologist. Anything
that has to do with glands.
It is a specialty
taught in our country,
it's why he came
improve himself here.
-Well then, until tomorrow.
-See you soon.
Goodbye, Madeleine.
-Goodbye, My Lady.
-Up.
I think you made
quite an impression.
Good. Repeat after me:
- "Lékar."
- "Lékar."
What do you mean?
I mean doctor in Czech.
Good. It means
"The best doctor in Prague."
Good.
You're ready, my dear.
What did I say?
"I am the wife of
best doctor in Prague. "
My God.
It was beautiful.
But Jaromil, you're crazy.
No, I'm in love.
I'm also in love, but ...
I must be honest, Jaromil.
I will never go to
Czechoslovakia with you.
So you don't love me.
How can you say that,
I adore you.
We don't let go of
the people we love.
I never said I would.
-Do you want to make me cry, is that it?
-Madeleine ...
I got to go back. I don't have
the right to stay in France.
But you told me that you
could get a visa to stay.
Yes, but I don't want to
spend my life here.
I don't want become your pimp.
In France don't they call
the husband of a whore a pimp?
Go, go.
we discover
the history of Prague
we discover
the history of Prague
A little to the left
of a Sputnik
A little to the left
of a Sputnik
I'm waiting for you.
Watch out,
they’re still hot
You see,
they’re not
completely cooked.
Don’t get under our feet
whilst we’re cooking.
Go see your uncle.
Where's Daddy?
He’s gone hunting.
to feed his family.
No, no.
Don't mess it up.
That's three times this week
he hasn’t come back...
I know, my dear.
Men sometimes
have this crazyness.
And then it passes.
But where is he?
What is he doing?
He must have been
on duty at the hospital.
Three shifts in the same week?
I'll make some tea.
- Where you going?
- To look for him.
We must stay calm.
It is the only thing we can do
under the circumstances.
-Madeleine, what are you doing here?
-Karel, I was so scared.
There are tanks everywhere
it's war ...
Not war, it's the Russians.
Come on, I'll take you home.
No, have to find Jaromil.
He left ages ago.
He never came home.
Get in.
You should go to the French Embassy,
Madeleine.
You're French, you can
leave the country with Jaromil.
Do you know where he is?
Take me there!
I want us to go back to Paris.
I don't care who he's with.
-Madeleine.
-Karel.
I can't.
This is between the two of you.
He'll be back in the morning.
You can travel during the day.
It's on the ground floor.
I can't wait for you.
You understand?
Jaromil!
Jaromil!
I know you're there.
I'm not angry, but we must go.
We must go immediately.
The Russians have invaded Prague.
-There are tanks in the city.
-She's crazy... always making things up.
Are you sure?
Yes, it's a joke!
She's amazing!
I swear, the cost may be high,
but this time I'm going
Oh, Prague!
What made me do it
Remember the ring
you put on my finger?
Your sun fades
with a final glow
Talk to her. Explain.
Now that she already knows.
-She knows nothing.
She's already gone.
And you can open your legs,
let's finish what we started.
The bells would
immediately play for me
Remember the ring
you put on my finger?
Your  sun fades
with a final glow
Honey, I could have someone
come and fix the bathroom light?
I'll fix it
at the weekend.
-Ready.
Thank you.
Mind my lipstick.
And the postman,
will the postman come?
We're entitled to a postman
like everyone else.
Yes.
Good morning, my princesses.
-Vera, it's ten to eight.
I'm not taking you by car,
I did warn you.
Yes I'm ready.
I need 15 francs.
-For what?
I need 15 francs, that's all.
You irritate me. I don't like
to give money that way.
Go.
Hello!
Mother dear ...
Go. Take your scarf.
I'm staying at Hotel Camellia.
Room 17.
Are you coming now?
Alright.
You're super late.
You should not have come.
I leave by plane tomorrow.
It is a medical congress.
And they let you out?
Don't blame the Communists.
I knew
you would turn communist.
I don't know a thing about politics,
but it is very beautiful.
Please.
Really.
Your second marriage is good.
You can notice. Long live France!
You wouldn't understand, Jaromil.
-I miss you.
-I warn you, nothing will happen.
I always think of you.
And what do you think?
I dream I'm
making love with you.
Yes? And it's good?
It's hard to say.
Very well.
Invite me to go to your room
but promise to behave.
-You are beautiful.
-No.
Men no longer
turn to watch me.
-They pass me by.
-Is it serious?
Before I was a mother they whistled.
Yes, it's serious.
Is life passing me
backwards.
-You being childish.
-Do you see this wrinkle?
What wrinkle?
-It wasn't there last week.
No?
I was sure you'd would do that.
Why did you call?
Either way,
I don't care.
-No.
-Yes.
-No.
-Yes.
Yes.
Wait ...
Wait.
Many people have died in Prague
in recent times.
All around me ...
Derek, Peter ...
They were run
by the Communists?
No, I'm talking
about people who simply die.
Because of the sadness.
Despair ...
It is a very sad life.
And you ...
You're not sad ?
I keep thinking about me.
And when I think of me,
I feel my heart beat weakly.
I say, "Madeleine quickly,
Madeleine think of me ... "
"Think of me ..." But my
heart remains weak.
So I start to scream ...
"Madeleine ... Madeleine ..."
"... Think of me."
You must hear me because ...
I feel my heart
beating again
little by little.
Don't mess with me.
There's something between us that ...
no divorce can
make disappear.
So why are we divorced?
It's a good question.
Why you married a policeman,
is also a good question.
He's not a policeman, he's a guard.
It's the same thing.
He's the perfect man for me.
I'd pay to see that!
Tell me about Vera.
She's not a good writer.
Liar. She writes every
month, I make her.
Force you mean.
She doesn't like writing, is that it?
Yes, she's 14 and does not
want to do anything, it's normal.
She looks like you.
You know what?
That girl is really his daughter.
She wants to see everything
Paris is not enough
She likes nothing
and wants to make her big exit.
The smell of the trains,
the noise from airports.
She can't be
quiet anywhere
I wonder if she
is vain
If she uses the mirror
and abuses her beauty
She doesn't like anything,
except going out at night
She gives her hand
to anyone at random,
As you told me
before, tell me.
-Miss ...
-What do you know?
-Is she ...
-You should see her.
She is more like
to you than you think
You know what?
That girl is really his daughter.
Her eyes are so black
that they sometimes seem frightening.
your skin.... I
remember the smell
and of your skin
I remember the feel.
I wonder if
this girl is beautiful
Without lipstick,
or painted eyebrows ...
As lovely as you
so that all the others are jealous
She has breasts
beautiful as these
her waist,
say yes.
-Miss ...
-What do you want to know?
-Is she ...
-You should see her.
She is more like
with you than you think.
I wonder if
the girl is like you
Without memories,
selfish and worry
Playful and joyful
is it inherited?
This happy amnesia that you
are living every day.
-Miss ...
Playful and lively,
-Is she ...
An idiot-happy ...
Son-fish, little fish is!
-Shut up.
You know what I think very well.
Her power is crazy
men
desire her for their selfish joy.
It's your fault.
They say "ready", I am
in love with an egoist.
I don't understand
what you are saying.
You've lost much of
your French, you know?
Is it a compliment or a
criticism that you're giving?
Did you know that it's sad when a man
needs to change his idea of love
in the middle of a sentence?
Because of
lack of vocabulary.
Yes, it was more a compliment.
Thank you.
I can get a visa, you know?
They explained to me all the documents,
procedures ...
I'll stay. If you and Vera come
with me immediately.
Why do you always do this?
I love you.
Jaromil.
Don't laugh. No one's allowed to enter here.
Do you know ... Do you know
that to seek political asylum
I have to ask the police.
Maybe I can address the problem,
whilst you're packing your bags.
I'm not taking a bag.
And don't make noise, run.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
Stop!
Quick!
Vera?
-Vera are you home?
I'm here.
It's Jaromil. Your father.
No greeting?
We're leaving.
We are three, the family.
François Gouriot, Understand?
Go pack your school things.
Take some clothes and put them in the trunk
that's in the hallway.
The rest we can get
later, okay?
-Return to Prague?
-No, no ... Don't worry.
But you have to be quick,
we don't have much time.
It's Dad returning.
He'll wonder where I am.
Take him to your room.
Hide under the bed.
Go with her.
-Dear.
-Where were you?
I said, I went shopping.
I was looking for a desk for the lounge.
Oh yes. How was it?
I didn't find anything.
I searched everywhere,
I'm exhausted.
-And you?
-Had a good day?
-But you have to go back?
-Yes.
You work too much, dear.
Vera ...
Vera, I won't say ...
your mother
has not be educated as she should
But you lack, baby,
a father's words.
The authority ...
Especially now
you are 14.
I'm not afraid to say
unpleasant things.
You are my daughter
and must be worthy.
Understand, dignity is the ...
most important thing for me.
It's the alpha and omega.
The moral backbone is dignity.
Vera.
Believe your father, dear.
It is important when we are
front of the mirror every morning
when shaving.
we are not obliged to spit at our own face.
I don't shave in the morning.
-But if you put make up on?
-I don't wear make-up.
You're right, it's useless.
But the idea works,
work when you comb.
Every day
take stock of the previous day.
and always before
a temptation, say:
no ... tomorrow morning when I shave
I will not be happy.
When I comb my hair?
combing hair, yes.
I think it's very clear.
Where are you sleeping?
In a hotel near the Place Clichy.
Tonight that will be our home
and tomorrow ...
and tomorrow we'll go
to the home of your aunt.
You're really going to spend all
of your life with us?
What is your mother doing?
You do not hear anything more.
I don't think it's a good idea
that you go out these.
I'll be careful.
You know, it was easy ...
It was cowardly,
what I did, leaving Prague ...
escape.
He said he wanted to stay,
wanted to resist ...
But would I resist?
The communists?
It was not my problem.
My problem was you,
You had a bright future.
I couldn't survice
alone in Paris.
He doesn't understand.
He always believed
I'd be back.
He never knew
how difficult it is to get
a corner of our own.
I made a living however I could.
Now, he's returned, he wants me...
then he doesn't want me anymore.
Your father is just a man, Vera.
Your father is perverse.
Your father is a bastard.
Vera, where you going?
It was the end of the Passer family.
The end of the story
the whore and the infidel.
I am the sex life of
my parents, it's just who I am.
If I look inside myself,
that's the story I see.
I was in the street, it was cold.
I no longer knew whether I was
angry with them
I just remember wanting
be loved intensely that night.
I wanted to understand what
caused me much pain.
Everything was so peaceful,
everything is silent
They talk about it,
but don't look at me.
For a sigh,
how many shots?
Everything is so calm
apparently
For a caress,
these scratches?
Everything is so calm
after the dance
Everything is so calm,
a great calm.
When I finally love,
that's it ...
Here in London
I'm calling, I don't know where.
I must have confused
fog with blur.
Here in London
I'm calling for those who don't know
no answer,
taxi stand empty
Here in London, I'm calling
I don't know how long
Big Ben must have melted,
I don't know what time it is.
Here in London
I don't know how I call
must be bored
is still waiting for me
-Clément, what are you doing here?
-What?
Where were you?
I was worried.
You forgot your coat.
Were you cold?
Sir, madame
What happened?
What happened?
Did he upset you?
No, I'm so tired.
I was sad, predictable.
Nandita decided
I should go to sleep.
What a crazy psycho fuck.
She thinks she's my mother.
She wouldn't let me
touch her breasts.
That's not fair, your room
is much bigger than the mine.
I'll sleep here.
I don't know. Promise to
behave? Clement?
I promise.
No sex between us.
Not even the idea of sex.
Together.
My belts stuck, it wonm't unbuckle.
-Can you help me?
-Yes.
But what happened here?
Pull the other side.
Wait.
Let's sit down, it'll be easier.
Like it when I grab that?
No.
And when I give you
a kiss, you don't like it?
No, don't be angry.
Wait.
Who is it?
Be careful.
-No problem.
Ah, yeah! I'm sorry.
The beaver is sleeping?
You know why they
have a flat tail?
It is because I have a flat tail
that you're calling me a beaver?
It's because they were sucked by ducks.
Then reread these 200 pages
I threw away erased that I didn't like
about the teacher.
Perhaps to keep the teacher
character as a novelist.
It was fun.
You don't do that. I asked
you to be here.
Got it? go away, go away.
You don't know me,
so don't touch me!
-You don't know me.
-Don't touch me.
Got it?
I'm not afraid of you, fuck you.
-I'm not afraid ...
Clément-!
-Come on.
- ... I'm not afraid of you.
You do not do that
when I'm here.
Do not be a whore
when I'm here.
And you stay here now.
Come, Nandita.
What are you doing here?
You were due back tomorrow.
Father, please put on some underwear.
I didn't warn you,
because it wasn't planned.
you are beautiful, my daughter,
so beautiful.
I never forgot that
I had a daughter.
I came back. I'm here and I'll stay.
I am living in the home of your aunt.
But I'll get a house.
You are beautiful.
So let me get this straight, you're going to
leave Reims and come back to Paris?
No, no, no ...
Your mother will not
leave Mr. Gouriot.
No, no ... he's retirement.
She needs him to have
a more peaceful life.
You won't understand.
I was talking with your father ...
-He began to caress me ...
No, stop mother ...
I don' want to know.
We didn't want
go to go to a hotel.
I had the keys to your home.
I wanted to see where
my daughter lives.
-Really?
-Yes.
-Why come back early?
-No reason.
Restaurant ...
Let's all go out to eat.
As a family!
I can't, I have to
catch the 7pm train.
You don't have a choice, we're goiong out to eat.
You only need to tell François ...
I want you to dine with me
and take the last train.
You are forcing me
lie and I don't like it.
What?
-Nothing, nothing.
-It's beautiful.
What?
To see the two of you together is beautiful.
I feel sorry for François.
He's no saint.
One day, I had sex
with a man in the barracks.
And I picked up an infection.
I had to talk to him.
It was like walking on eggs,
I was so nervous.
No sooner had told him that maybe
had an infection
than he dropped to his knees,
dropped to the floor
Saying that I should
forgive him
that this woman had bewitched him,
but he wouldn't see her again.
Such a drama!
Do you really need to tell me
this kind of thing, Mum?
Just to give you an example.
For you to know
your mother is not the devil ...
Francois and Gouriot
are not saints.
And my father,
thinking of going back to see him?
What do you advise me?
Would you be happy?
That's the question.
This is something that'll only be known in time,
It's not worth thinking about now.
Yes .. So you're
thinking of returning to see him.
If he wants to ... Perhaps, yes.
You'll be waiting
by the phone, trust me.
You'll keep me informed?
-And you? And your love?
No, shut your mouth!
I can't ask?
It's too much.
I found a person in London,
an American.
What's he like?
He's very cute.
He's very seductive, he's perfect
and he's gay.
That annoying.
I advise you not fall in love.
On the other hand, it could be amusing.
My heart is heavy
and the reason
A heavy heart
and its mysteries
Everything weighs,
everything that harms
A heavy heart
always takes
The light-hearted girls
and one day
We have this feeling
of failure
of being superficially
abandoned
This superficiality,
I offer you
Do you get
superficially disappointed
But now my
heart weighs a ton
I heard you get up,
my dear.
I found the Jaquis,
this morning at the bakery.
He invited us for a Tarot
session tonight.
Very well. Want to go?
Yes, I want to go.
Well, I have to go.
I know that you
like the rest of the morning.
But ... What are you doing here?
I didn't satisfy myself yesterday. I'm coming.
No, don't come in.
Your ex-husband is here.
Oh yeah?
Yes.
It's beautiful backyard!
Did you plant it, Madeleine?
-Yes.
Really?
The orchard, too?
-The backyard is her kingdom.
Truth?
I'll drink more coffee.
Mr. Gouriot ...
I will explain
the reason for my visit.
I came here to ask for Madeleine's hand ...
Madeleine
But what is he saying?
Madeleine. I want
her to be my wife.
As in the beginning.
I ask you to give her a divorce.
I don't know if Madeleine
want's one, so I thought ...
it would be better ...
if you were to tell her ...
to leave with me.
My dear,
you should dress.
-Yes.
-I will talk a little with Jaromil.
When you were
the Republican Guard
riding a horse?
Don't think I'm stupid.
You know, I know what happened
between you after the divorce.
I found several letters.
in which you asked her for photographs
in which you told her to sleep with
other men and then tell you.
Madeleine always obeyed you.
I endured it.
However, during all
these years it was a heartbreak.
I suppose that since you are
in Paris, she will want to see you.
I won't fight it.
It is up to Madeleine.
But you can be sure
she will never leave.
Because I really love
and respect her.
You can not understand.
You don't respect anything.
So listen, I ask
you to leave my house
and never return.
Please.
Wouldn't you rather kicked me out on my ass?
He's gone.
-I swear I knew nothing.
-I believe you.
Want a divorce?
No, why? I didn't ask for anything!
-So I hear ...
Never deceive me,
I know that you will never change.
I will forget all about  your
relations with her ex-husband.
Sure
He was very pleased
to come up here for me
give this great news.
I heard nothing,
I don't know anything.
And I do not want anyone else,
besides the two of us know that.
Don't say anything to our friends.
Don't tell Vera.
Never talk about the subject.
-Continue to be your wife?
-I don't talk about it.
Of course you remain
my wife.
Not if you don't understand
we have more than sex.
-I understood.
-It's up to you.
This man, in my eyes,
does not exist.
I'm going to Nico,
shall I bring crayfish for lunch?
A good idea, crayfish.
Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning.
I'm sorry.
Can I talk to you a second?
-What is it?
-Damn, you scared me ...
I thought you would not talk
me anymore.
One more.
-Today is the day of presentations
-Yes.
It is the turn-of whom?
It's not here.
It must be here, look!
She told me, "Kuntz" behind
the "Gare de L'Est."
-Look, "Kuntz".
- "Kuntz."
"Kuntz, Kuntz". It seems
"Apocalypse Now", but in Alsace.
Colonel Kuntz.
What are you doing in there?
My dear!
Clement, I'm glad to see you.
Me too, I'm happy.
-And this meeting?
I took advantage of the fact that she
is in Paris for you ...
and bought a birthday present.
It is from me and your father.
-Yes?
We bought it together this afternoon.
Open it, I'm on tenterhooks.
He's staying
on the second floor.
He's sleeping, we shouldn't not wake him.
Coming to the station?
You're not staying?
No, François would be worried.
No, I'm really here for your birthday.
-It is a DVD player.
-How kind.
Don't be like that. We'll have a party
on Sunday anyway.
-You coming, Clement?
-Sure I will.
My father is
staying in that hotel?
It's very practical.
I can come and go on the same day.
It is somewhat
my second home.
Yes, but whoever has two homes,
has lost their mind.
If you could try not
to have an opinion.
Whenever I want to see him.
It worries me to leave him alone
in Paris like this.
I need him.
I need him so much. Good, but
I will not bore you with that.
But you'll have to decide.
You can't hide forever.
But why?
We like it this way.
I must go, or I'll
end up arriving late.
Could we
stop fooling ourselves?
-What did you say?
-Nothing. Forget it.
-Have a good journey.
-Yes.
-What?
-I speak of faithfulness ...
It's a good thing
fidelity, when you love someone.
-Are you serious?
No, I'm tired.
When I'm tired
I'm sentimental.
I'm very tired.
Was that was picked out of love
or because she's tired.
Yeah, I'm encouraged
to regain my strength.
I prefer vitamins.
A, B, C, D.
Let's go to the pharmacy.
-Want it?
-Slutty.
I believe
I cry
Waiting for you
anywhere
-The fish is for whom?
Thank you
It is for me. Thank you.
-Enjoy.
-This is good.
What are you eating?
You should not eat ...
such sophisticated things.
Enough already, don't start.
That's a meal
-French.
-So go on attack.
I was careless.
You? No.
It's your mother that is careless.
You are brave.
I don't see the courage
to love someone who does not want me.
You know what it is to be brave?
You do ... whatever the cost
even knowing ...
that you'll lose.
That's courage.
Courage and caution
are virtues
fundamental.
-Yes?
-Yes.
Our virtues,
Your mother and mine
are carelessness, pride ...
pleasure, anger.
Yes.
-You never wear colorful clothes?
-I don't look good in them.
Come ...
I want to buy a dress.
No, you do not have a father.
-No, c'mon, c'mon.
-No.
You can't ...
I am your father and I will buy you
a dress.
You must be married
to wear a sari.
I've never heard such idiocy.
Come on, come on. Go in.
Choose.
This pattern is beautiful, no?
Try this, go into the changing room.
leaves traces.
You are very cute?
This is not pretty
for a girl like you.
Go, go, hurry up.
-I have an appointment.
-The changing room is ...
You have a meeting with whom?
With a person
I see in secret.
No daddy, don't start.
Shit.
-800 Franks?
-Yes.
Thank you.
-So?
I do not know even how to put it on.
You have to tie it.
Hurry up.
You have beautiful legs my dear.
Until Friday, until Friday.
Goodbye.
Look out!
Okay? Don't move,
we should send for a doctor ...
-A doctor, no.
-You'd better sit down.
I am a doctor, leave me alone.
Jaromil ...
You are the Vera-Passer?
-Yes.
Can you come with me, please.
This way.
Let's sit down a minute.
I just saw the results of the
examination done on your father.
The strike caused a mild bleeding
and a concussion.
It is important with a blow
to the head.
Unfortunately, the lesions are too
serious for us to operate.
He's been hospitalized
with the rehabilitation service.
Can I see him?
Yes, for sure.
I'll go with you. The nurses
are preparing him.
Want some coffee while we wait?
No, the doctor will see him?
-I am the doctor.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No offence. This way.
I really liked the dress, you know.
You're right,
I look good in pink.
-So?
-We don't know anything yet.
-Cigarette?
-Yes.
-It was nice of you to come.
-That's what friends do.
See how we can be friends?
Finally, this is more like old times.
No, come here.
We were lovers 6 times
a couple for four days and a half,
and the 3rd night of the story
we were almost parents.
Yes, in the end just ...
becoming friends,
after completion of a transaction.
It's not true. After sex
there was a little tenderness.
-A great tenderness.
-A great tenderness?
Yes, That now gone.
I think we are too
old for tenderness.
You're not even 30.
Yes, but it's all screwed up.
In one or two years, students
will call you "uncle."
-You got a tattoo?
Not real-shit.
A girl who wrote this
for me to remember her.
I should have taken a bath
before I came, I was stupid.
-Not with anyone?
-I'm with Henderson.
How so Henderson.
He came back to see you?
No. I'm always
thinking about him, it's pathetic.
It's impossible to imagine
you with another man.
He's my imaginary husband.
Yes, marriage is more abnormal
since there are weddings.
Do you believe in fate?
I need fresh air.
I have not found a girl
who's neck I'd write on.
Why not?
It seems ideal for you.
Where are you going?
Don't you see that is my handwriting?
Why did you do it?
Clément. We got lost.
-Yes ...
-Know where they put him?
Yes, down the hall.
Okay, François?
Vera?
I don't understand.
I shouldn't be here.
I don't understand.
Let's talk in French, then?
-Try!
-Okay.
There is one thing I have to tell you
I think I'm HIV positive.
Yes, yes. I was super cautious.
I was crazy in New York.
Very crazy.
One night,
I found a man in a bar.
I was drunk
I do not remember anything.
The next morning in my room ...
Do not remember the sex ...
but I knew I we'd done it ...
without a condom.
How do I cure myself of such stupidity
It makes ...
It makes me fear the worst
I panicked ...
I decided to leave New York.
which means
they are priceless
Someone else
would be more convenient
On 9/11, my daughter embarked
on a plane to New York.
She said she would
visit her American.
Who had returned to America.
She said it was Henderson
who asked her to go.
he had left his boyfriend.
And wanted to see her.
European flights to New York
were diverted to Canada.
After the attack
against the twin towers.
Vera landed in Montreal
All flights were suspended.
Stuck there.
Air France
arranged this hotel.
I don't even know what part
of the city I'm in.
Henderson will pick me up by car
he has the address.
Is Montreal near New York?
Give or take,
six hours.
He should arrive tonight.
You had told me that they
lost your bags on the plane.
They'll send them to New York.
You shouldn't go there.
You should return to France.
Mother, there is no probability
of that happening.
Like a drop of water,
anything is possible
You were beautiful,
try not think about it
Who broke
This line of flight?
The French never
forget to eat.
Okay ... Don't start!
Mathieu.
How is New York?
It's weird ...
distressing, unreal ...
Strange, a strong smell ...
like dust burned.
Sometimes smells of petrol
You're Henderson's boyfriend?
Yes more or less.
I'll see if they're still serving
food in the restaurant.
Want something?
Mother, did I wake you up?
I'm sorry. No, it's okay,
I'm fine.
We leave tomorrow morning. I'm
very happy to be with Henderson.
Go back to sleep. I love you very much.
What?
Can't I say that I love you?
Go back to sleep.
Have they restored the networks?
Do the phones work?
I don't know, I haven't tried.
-Am I bothering you?
-No. I'm going to bed.
-But that stupid. I woke you up?
-Stop ... It's your room.
Henderson is sleeping.
Completely wiped-out.
He's a heavy sleeper.
I'm not sleeping my friends.
Okay?
Want a drink?
Can you change the channel?
Yes.
Before leaving the room
Vera stole all
of Henderson pills.
She went to the bar.
And swallowed them all discreetly.
The whole box.
A lethal dose.
Nobody saw her take the pills.
People remember her
dancing alone in a corner.
People didn't want to look at her.
My daughter who
danced through the night.
They were ashamed.
And then ...
those sitting at the bar... they saw nothing.
We have just seen your mother, Clément.
Sorry you're sick.
Your parents were never vaccinated?
No, it's not worth taking,
unless you're a child.
I saw on the Internet that pertussis
is infectious for 4 weeks.
Yeah, I know. But I'm still
tired, be careful.
We should have called before,
we apologize.
We are ashamed to have
guests, you are sick ...
That's how we learned of the death
a friend of Madeleine.
No, but it was a good idea
this invitation, I think that ...
very good, for you to make a party.
I will not lie,
we wanted to see you.
Madeleine has always asked me
to invite you.
You're the only one present
she wants.
-It's next Wednesday?
Yes, lunchtime.
There's a train that arrives at 12:13.
I confess to being a little afraid
of seeing them.
I don't know if I can
face it all.
He is saying
won't have the courage.
What an idiot!
He can roast and eat their balls,
Can we count on you,
Clément.
Yeah, I gotta go.
I have ...
I have to go, a kiss!
-Okay?
-Stop!
You're crazy.
What is it? Yes, Madeleine.
I told your husband that I would.
Is that clear enough.
Kate ...
Moreover,
no one goes to Reims
I will spend the Sunday at home
between four walls.
Tuesday, I don't know,
but the only thing
is that on Wednesday,
I'll be here.
Clean the grave,
see the rocks bloom.
that's what's planned for
Reims on Wednesday
below zero,
that's why
Reims is quite depressing
under the arcades
Which hugs your body
in its arms
It's Mireille.
Come in, come!
-Okay?
-Yes.
Everybody in the lounge.
It's at the back of the house.
-Okay?
-We waited for you at lunch!
Lunch was for close friends
Coffee is for the neighbors.
-Why didn't you come for lunch?
The trains were on strike.
Only running a skeleton servive,
I had to wait ages.
I spent the day at the station.
No scolding, please.
Thank you. Madeleine had
a crisis because you did not come.
She locked herself in her room.
Didn't want to eat.
I couldn't get
her to leave the room.
-A cigarette?
-Yes.
Thank you. Got a light?
She's upset, you know.
For weeks ...
had been fine and then out of nowhere.
She doesn't want to see anyone,
won't speak to me.
for days ...
And then one morning,
She makes coffee and laughs.
As if nothing had happened.
Yes, she lost her daughter.
It's no small thing.
-Now she's all alone.
-All alone ... All alone ...
Shit, what about me?
for 34 years she's lived with me.
She's not alone.
But how stupid is that?
If I stay,
will she open the door.
I've never done this through
a closed door.
What are you talking about?
My dear. Clément just
arrived. He's here by my side.
I'll leave you alone.
Do something about it.
Come in.
Good afternoon.
Are you alone?
Yes.
Won't you look at me?
Don't you want to look at me?
I'm ugly. I'm tired of crying.
You never cried before.
No, you're right.
I never cried so much.
However, sadness ...
I was sad,
but I could control myself.
This is already happening.
I can put up with ugly faces.
It is not ugly, it's beautiful.
He said I was depressed?
No.
He said you were not well.
He says it to everyone.
It's crazy, I'm fine.
There are days when I ...
I can not look at him.
He's not guilty, so is ...
You see, there are mornings when
is difficult to say to someone ...
"I love you"
thinking, "I don't love you."
Well, I think that's what happiness is.
Don't make fun.
I no longer think about happiness ...
Not for a long time.
It doesn't stop me from being happy.
I trust in life ...
but do not trust happiness.
You are depressed.
They are going to light
the candles  ...
Want to go?
Really?
-Yes. Seriously.
Go down for a bit. Blow out the candles
and then come with me, okay?
Come on. I'll wait below.
Be quick.
Happy birthday to you ...
Happy birthday to you ...
Happy Birthday, Madeleine ...
Happy birthday to you ...
Blow.
Congratulations, congratulations.
Where are you going?
Clement wants to leave.
I'm going with him to the cemetery.
Let's look at Vera,
before you catch the train.
-Want me to take you in the car?
-No.
Let's walk,
it will do me good, I drank too much.
-But you're coming back?
-Beautiful your new toy, Jackie.
Bye, François.
Bye!
Okay?
Vera was a gift for you.
You were never married, but were
always in love.
Don't say stupid things.
-There are no happy marriages.
-You don't say.
She was never
in love with me.
-You think so?
-You know.
No, I do not know.
Vera always managed
hide her feelings.
Well, I realized that she loved him.
-I wouldn't call it love.
-What would you call it?
She dreamed of being
Henderson's wife.
If that's not love?
-A melodrama.
-So you're saying she never loved him.
That man never loved her.
You were the one who loved her.
What is better, being the who is beloved
or being the lover?
His place. I would have given my
life to be in his place.
You're right.
Clément, catch the door.
I'll explain.
You know, I already know the story.
How you fell in love with a client,
a medical student.
That didn't work, bringing him to your apartment.
This part I also know.
That Vera was conceived,
that first time.
Your freedom, his joy.
I was not an easy woman,
by any means.
At the time it was easy,
very easy.
But Vera was not conceived here.
I was just saying,
I don't want to know.
It was him who wanted me.
Vera always thought that I was
passionate about her father, but no.
We spent the night together and then ...
in the morning I sent him away.
He didn't want to
He wasn't working.
I'm not your toy.
Not my toy?
So what are you?
-A whore.
-Madeleine, please.
-I'm in love with you.
-That's absurd.
-You love all French women.
-I'm not crazy about all French women.
I'm not crazy about De Gaulle,
just you.
You're beautiful.
Today finds me beautiful
and tomorrow, who knows.
Whether you'll fall for me?
I am not indifferent
to your Russian charm.
I'm not Russian.
What do you mean "indifferent"?
You're allowed to love me.
Thank you.
-Go away.
-Bye, Mrs. Whore.
-Goodbye, Mr. Customer.
Have you ever loved a man?
You have to go.
It's something that no
man ever dared to ask you ...
and are you ready
to do it for me?
I'm cold.
I feel very cold.
Love me forever.
You're forbidden to
love other men.
There are some people
who spend their lives.
Who take so long
to understand that ...
freedom
is the worst offense to love.
Since the death of Jaromil ...
I am not the same,
and you've disappeared as well.
That when he went
so did I
I no longer recognize myself.
It's not pretty when you miss someone.
Mother always said
"It's not pretty when you miss someone."
Thank you.
