ENTHUSIASTS, LED BY OUR OWN
EUGENE FELSNICK.
AND SPEAKING OF EXPLOSIVES, THE
SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS DECIDED THIS
YEAR TO SUSPEND OUR
DUCK-AND-COVER EXERCISES AT THE
HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL SINCE MOST OF
YOU ARE TOO BIG TO FIT UNDER THE
DESKS.

LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO BUILD A
NEW BOMB SHELTER WITH ENOUGH
ROOM FOR ALMOST EVERYONE.
NEXT FRIDAY WILL BE OUR FIRST
PEP RALLY, AND EVERYONE KNOWS
YOU CAN'T HAVE PEP WITHOUT
CHEER.
SO DON'T FORGET TO SIGN UP FOR
CHEERLEADING, GIRLS, UNLESS
OF COURSE YOU'VE HAD A PREVIOUS
HEAD INJURY.
I WANT TO SEE PLENTY OF SUPPORT
FOR COACH CALHOUN AND THE RYDELL
RANGERS.
REMEMBER, IF YOU CAN'T BE AN
ATHLETE, BE AN ATHLETIC
SUPPORTER.
AND FINALLY, THE NATIONAL
BANDSTAND TELEVISION SHOW IS
CONSIDERING RYDELL AS A
REPRESENTATIVE AMERICAN HIGH
SCHOOL TO BROADCAST LIVE FROM
OUR GYM.
IF CHOSEN, WE WILL HAVE THE
CHANCE TO SHOW THE ENTIRE NATION
WHAT BRIGHT, CLEAN-CUT,
WHOLESOME STUDENTS WE HAVE HERE
AT RYDELL.
GOOD LUCK TO US ALL.

GUYS
SMILE AT THEM AND BAT MY EYES ?
? PRESS AGAINST THEM WHEN WE
DANCE ?
? MAKE THEM THINK THEY STAND A
CHANCE ?

? I COULD STAY HOME EVERY NIGHT
WAIT AROUND FOR MR. RIGHT ?
? TAKE COLD SHOWERS EVERY DAY ?
? THEN THROW MY LIFE AWAY
ON A DREAM THAT WON'T COME
TRUE ?
? I COULD HURT SOMEONE LIKE ME
OUT OF SPITE OR JEALOUSY ?
? I DON'T STEAL AND I DON'T LIE
BUT I CAN FEEL AND I CAN CRY ?
? A FACT I'LL BET YOU NEVER KNEW
BUT THE CRYING IN FRONT OF YOU
? THAT'S THE WORST THING I COULD
DO ??
