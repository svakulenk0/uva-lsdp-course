This place is
unbelievable Bhaveshbhai,
you won't see such
a place anywhere in India.
The shops are openly selling weapons.
As a matter of fact women
and children are also carrying guns.
You would've been
shocked to see this sight.
I am seeing a market full
of weapons for the first time.
Oh Bapu, welcome, welcome.
Please come to my shop!
I assure you, you will not find this
quality of guns anywhere in India.
I will call you later.
Don't worry about the price
just come, come, come Bapu.
Look at this one Bapu, all these
guns have been made here itself.
...hand-made... world famous
in the whole of Ranjaar.
This is a Russian Kalashnikov right?
This is a Rajanikov Bapu,
not a Kalashnikov.
It's not a gun if it
is not made by a Rajadi.
You sell these guns openly...
...aren't you worried
the Police might catch you?
Who cares about the Police...
Bapu the fact is, guns rule
this land. What choice do we have?
There are enemies across the border
and enemies across the street as well.
There are enemies over there as well?
Yes those bloody Saneras...
Forget about them Bapu,
try the range of this gun.
This one goes straight for the enemy.
These bloody Rajadis, they
are acting way too smart today...
Hey everybody, listen up...
These Rajadis are bloody useless...
...they should remove their
beards and wear a dress...
Did you see Bapu,
anything we do, they retaliate.
Looks like an old grudge.
There are only three cuss words...
which we Rajadis know,
Sanera Sanera and Sanera...
Son of a gun!
These Rajadis are
way out of line today.
Looks like they have
forgotten our last brawl.
These beggars need another
dose of imported bullets.
Hey... hey... how dare you
take a piss here you idiot.
You better gel out of here
or I will break your head you rascal.
It's my terrace I am pissing from,
I can't help where it falls what's
your problem you bloody Sanera!
You piece of filth, bloody Rajadi!
Bapu!
Wait you mongrel! Rajadi!
I will wipeout the
entire Rajadi clan today.
Hey!
Hey you... bloody m!
Brother don't stress.
This is an everyday
affair in our neighborhood.
What are you talking about...
...he just shot at a kid!?
That kid is our clan
leader's grandson.
Today the bullets were
rained on Goli as well.
You are fortunate as
there will be a huge brawl...
"between the Rajadis and Saneras."
- So which one do you want?
- Bloody hell...
You hit a customer!
Bloody, slimy Sanera!
It's a brawl!
Bloody Saneras!
Meghjibhai...
Meghjibhai,
Those bloody dogs fired at Goli. The
situation is getting out of control!
Bapu... he shot at
me... that too 4 times.
Who?
Bhavani!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's fix them!
People are just randomly
firing at each other,
this is absolutely shocking...
Bhavesh bhai!
Move! Move!
Ram!
Ram!
Why will Ram be at home at this hour?
Kasai Bhabhi,
a melee has broken out...
...Meghjibhai has gone
alone to fight the enemy.
Maa, Uncle Ram should
also be with father!
Ram is the only one who
believes in peace and love.
But these people
won't even spare him.
You can find Ram at his
usual hangout, Hanuman Lane...
"A swing in his walk."
"The twinkle in his eyes."
"And his usual mischief."
"Watch him win hearts."
"A swing in his walk."
"The twinkle in his eyes."
"And his usual mischief."
"Watch him win hearts."
"Watch him walk and protect,
watch his bravery."
"Watch it... watch it..."
"He has a brave and lovely heart."
"He has a brave and lovely heart."
"And a sharp tongue.
Watch him throwing tantrums."
"Look at everything in depth,
the hearts are united."
"He invites enmity with enemy, but
love always flows in his heart."
"Watch it... watch it..."
"The sparkle in his soul.
Eyes like darts."
"The sparkle in his soul.
Eyes like darts."
"Watch him make move,
he'd heal any wound."
"Look at his expressions.
Watch him providing shelter."
"Anyone listening to him
will spread sweet notes."
"Watch it... watch it..."
Don't spare. C'mon.
Out of my way...
Out...!
Your nephew,
your own blood, has been shot at.
While we were fighting
for our dignity there...
...this guy was singing
and dancing away to glory...
...and this time he has created
a whole new record Baapji,
he let that horrid man Bhavani
escape from right under my nose!
He saved the enemy's life.
- Poppat, go open the window.
- Yes sir.
Look at it this way, Baapji...
I saved Meghjibhai from
committing a murder.
We have been so
obsessed with killing...
...that we have forgotten
the value of life.
And why is everyone blaming me?
Why don't you all tell
Goli where to aim his piss.
Smart Boy.
You forget when you were
his age you killed one of their men?
It was an accident...
and I paid for it as well...
...you exiled me to Ahmedabad for
that crazy, old hag.
Bloody hell, it's sheer stupidity...
...to try and save
someone's life in Ranjaar...
Send me back if you wish...
Receive your call. It's ringing.
Bijal Baby,
I am coming... l am coming...
...right now a little tension,
later I will give you full attention.
See Baapji, look at this boy
he runs a video store of porn films,
deals in stolen cars...
Only girls on his mind...
mornings it's Bijal...
"afternoons for Sejal...
and for the night it's Kinjal."
With him around who needs an enemy?
The show off carries an empty gun!
All you need is guts
to be a hero Meghjibhai,
so what is the point of
a loaded gun when I have guts?
Then what is the point
of having you around?
This place is only for men.
Hey! You can ask any girl in
the entire village about my man-hood.
You will get an awesome report,
Meghjibhai.
Bhai... bhai... bhai... bhai...
And before I leave let me say this...
...we have used words,
we have used bullets...
...now is the time
to use our brains...
...let's join hands with the enemy.
Today these guns
have been raised at you,
next time you say this,
they will fire.
We might not have
Dhankor's wealth or power.
But we have the
courage to destroy her.
We take great pride in our clan
and our pride means everything to us.
Even an ocean which was
immersed in pride did not know...
...that one day it will
become a barren desert,
if that ocean could
not sustain its pride...
...then what are we
com pared to it, Baapji.
Hey Poppat, open the window...
Ram has just returned and is already
having differences with his father.
I'm glad he is back otherwise
who would have saved him.
Mura, the bone is hurting...
Buahujoor,
the gun slipped out of my hand...
otherwise I would've
easily killed 4 or 5 Rajadis.
There was a cloudburst
in Uttarakhand...
well... well... sad... very sad...
My brother took a
bullet in his chest...
...are you sure the same
blood runs through your veins?
You know my blood is more
volatile than my father's...
I swear on you,
I swear on Goddess Am be,
I will kill each and every Rajadi.
Brain and brawn should
be used at the right time.
What do you think, Vanka?
Yes... yes!
What are you sitting here
and nodding your head for?
Spit it out, bhai!
Yes Hujoor, the court has
issued a notice in your name.
It is an enquiry regarding
the 4 murders last month.
Oh! Regarding
the 4 murders last month,
what about the 6 which
will happen next month?
Forget about the past.
I told you, don't press the bone...
Vanka, bring your court here...
Dhankor will go nowhere.
Yes... of course Hujoor.
Ujjwal, where is Kanji?
Hujoor, I will call him right away...
You have come home after 10 long
days, I am not sparing you tonight.
Really?
Kanji bhai! Baa is calling you!
I need to go meet Baa, I
haven't met her since I've returned.
A lovely proposal has come for Leela,
I need to show the
boy's picture to Baa.
Show it to her later, you
have another priority right now...
Oh come on,
you will ruin all the photos.
Give me just one peek!
He must be from Ahmedabad!
He is an NRI...
You mean, Leela who is
like a red chilli will get...
...a groom who's
like a chocolate cake?
He will move in with
us post the wedding...
...we won't let him take Leela away.
You mean Leela won't
stay with her in-laws?
Let me tell you,
this kind of possessiveness
for your sister is ridiculous.
I also left my maternal
home post marriage.
So am I not possessive
about you as well?
Kanjibhai!
Attending your Baa and your sister's
whims and fancies all day long...
...how will we ever make babies?
Kanji bhai, Baa is calling you!
Go and tell Baa,
Kanji will meet her after half...
...no, one hour.
Ujjwal, why has Kanji not come yet?
He is on his way, Hujoor.
This year's chilli crop
seems extremely fiery...
Bhavani, taste and tell.
Baa
Baa you asked for me?
Pranaam!.
You have been home for a while and now
you find the time to come and see me?
Baa, actually...
I know what happens behind
those closed doors all day long...
...when will we see the result of it?
Any ways, what about the proposal
which has come for my Leela?
He is an NRI, Baamgood,
simple guy... this is his photo.
Never mind the photo...
call him over for Holi.
So Bhavani, what say?
Now use this fire...
...against the Rajadis.
We've held these Rajadis
on a leash for 25 years,
but now their guns are blaring.
Do me a favor let's play Holi...
Go away... Move!
Stop it all of you sex-starved
losers... come on... today is Holi!
Why wasting time watching porn,
when we can real fun outside!
Oh go away!
The main scene is going on...
Hey Rambhai, Keshav is going
to get married soon, let him watch...
...he needs bedroom lessons otherwise
he will be clueless on his first night!
What are friends for? We will
reach in time to do the needful.
Rambhai...
Come on... today we will celebrate your
bachelor party in the Sanera Mansion!
What?
Obviously... we have already
enjoyed all the Rajadi girls.
Are you crazy? Has any
Rajadi ever gone there before?
We will go...
trust me the first time is the best.
Celebrate Holi with the enemy?
Rubbish!
If anyone sees us there,
they will shoot us on the spot!
We are not afraid, Baapla.
You loser! There is only one
kind of gun needed to play Holi...
...and that everyone has, right?
Of course!!!
Any ways, no one will
recognize us in the chaos...
...don't worry... we are safe.
I guarantee it.
Come on now... l will pay
for the next two porn films...
...let's go,
I can't control it any more!
And see...
Watch out all of you Sanera girls,
I am coming!
Happy Holi!
You betrayed us to the Rajadis?!
You coward! I swear, I will kill you!
Baa...
Welcome... Please com e. - Hey...
Baa, meet Karsanbhai,
our future son-in-law. - Welcome.
Good evening, Baa.
- God bless... Please take a seat.
- No, I'm fine.
You have come all the way
from London, you must be hungry...
No thanks.
This is Aandva
right?
It's Haandva,
not Aandva...
Ya... same thing... Aandva!
Haandva... H... H...
I craved so much
for this in London...
Ever smiling guy.
He is a good catch, Kanji.
By the way Karsanbhai,
what do you do?
I am an Archaeologist.
Meaning?
It means we dig up old
structures and study them...
Really?
Studying, digging, restoring...
You know what I mean...
Umm... By the way what
is your family business?
Shooting, smuggling, killing...
...you know, what I mean...
Welcome to the family business...
...oh, your hands are shaking?
The day your hands stop shaking,
holding the gun...
...would be the correct
day for the wedding, right Kanji?
Yes Baa.
Karsan bhai, this is the family
you will get married into...
...and wishing you a very happy Holi!
Happy Holi!
Greetings!
Stop screwing around!
How much deeper do you want to go?
I will push in till the end,
Baapla...
I think you are trying
to bell the cat!
Hey! If you are scared, then leave...
Hey!
Now how many times will
you change your clothes?
But I don't want to get married...
Baa has summoned you
so that's it...
God bless you.
Karsan, meet my daughter Leela...
Hey Ram, let's go!
She is the enemy's daughter!
Oh destiny!
We are star-crossed lovers!
Leela, meet your groom.
Karsan from London...
...Kanji has chosen him for you.
Happy Holi, Miss Leela...
I will be honored
if you agree to marry me.
Congratulations!
It's agreed then... touch
the feet and take the blessings now.
Touch the feet!
Hey...
He is such a catch!
Oh, she is so coy!
Happy Holi!
"As my heart soars up to join you."
"It leaves this world
behind for you..."
"I've tasted blood."
"The sleeping desire in my
veins has now awakened."
"I've tasted blood."
"By touching of lips..."
"...from the corner of dreams."
"By touching of lips..."
"...from the corner of dreams."
This bloodlust has brought
us together forever...
"I've tasted blood."
"I've tasted blood."
"Today this mad one is
roaming here and there..."
"Today, the breath is stuck
with him only."
"It used to flow freely.
It used to remain full to brim."
"It used to flow freely.
It used to remain full to brim."
"I don't know when it
went away taking my life."
"Lips, touched lips, touched blood."
"I've tasted blood."
"I've tasted blood."
"The sleeping desire in my
veins has now awakened."
"I've tasted blood."
"By touching of lips,
from the corner of dreams."
"By touching of lips,
from the corner of dreams."
"Lips, touched lips,
touched blood."
"I've tasted blood."
"I've tasted blood."
"I've tasted blood."
Despite all our wealth and clout,
those boys managed
to saunter into our house.
How to recognize the enemy in
all that color and chaos, Kanjibhai!
Idiot, you don't need to
see the enemy, you sense him.
And Vanka,
I heard those Rajadis have hidden...
...a huge stock of
bullets in their home...
Should I be giving you
this information?
I was just about to tell you, but...
But what?
We have to clip their wings Vanka.
Listen, Radhubhai
has gone on a pilgrimage.
And his two sons Ram and
Meghji are completely useless.
I agree.
Now do you want me to spell
out what needs to be done next?
You know I like the color of money,
so do you want me to spell out...
...what needs to be done next?
Here, as much as you want.
But beware,
if I ever see any
Rajadi around my Leela,
then you will pay
for it with your blood.
Come on now Ram...
we are fed up...
...we have been waiting for hours
but not a glimpse of that girl.
Let's leave now!
Not without seeing her...
I can't control any more,
I am going in!
Don't stop me!
She is all I can think about!
Then you need to get your
thoughts out of your pants!
Right now my heart, my thoughts
everything is in my pants!
- But how will you find her room?
- Very simple.
Moonlight will stream
out of her windows...
"because she is the moon itself!"
Hey Romeo, what if it turns
out to be her mother's room?
Then arrange for my funeral!
And what if it's her brother's room?
Then arrange for His funeral!
I hope you are aware what will happen
if you enter the wrong room?
But can you imagine what all
can happen if I enter the right room?
You will be the death of us.
Gosh... it's you?
You've come till here?
If you want I can come till there...
Have you lost your mind, if someone
sees you, you will be in big trouble!
I am already in trouble...
...you have taken my breath away
and I need it back!
So take it and leave, any ways
we don't keep anything of strangers.
Stranger?
Have you forgotten how
you colored this stranger?
How can I forget that?
Hey there, wait up,
I have come to tell you a secret...
- What?
- Secret!
- Hi!
- Hi!
So what's the secret?
Listen, get this straight...
...don't fall in love with me
I am a Rajadi, your enemy!
Enemy?
No wonder our eyes were battling...
Wow!
You are as sexy as
you are dangerous...
And you are as dangerous
as you are cocky!
That's why I have an awesome idea...
...let's change our last names!
Then I won't be a Rajadi
and you won't be a Sanera...
Simple. Problem solved.
Will you eat a rose
if you start calling it rice?
- What's in a name?
- Good point!
Leela!!!
Oh Lord Ram!
How beautiful my name
sounds when you say it!
- What?
- Ram!
Leela! Ram Leela!
Leela...
- Wait... I'm coming!
- I am sleeping!
Shut up, I am coming!
- Hey, what are you doing? Go.
- Yes, but Leave me...
Where are you going?
Hey, Leela...
On my Way!
Why aren't you opening the door?
What is that noise
coming from your room?
A peacock has entered my room!
Forget the peacock,
Baa is calling you downstairs...
You go ahead, I will come in a bit...
Come soon!
Now you have reached my bed?
Your bed is as hot as you.
Quite daring you are...
risked your life and came here!
Am I that beautiful?
Yes! I will give up my life for
you... take a bullet right here...
...on my chest.
Oh! You have absolutely
no hair on your chest!
Oh! Neither do you...
There is a saying around here,
a man with a hairless chest
cannot be trusted.
Forget about trusting me...
just marry me.
Marry you?
Ok fine.
I have been desperately
waiting for my wedding day.
You agreed so easily!
Haven't I waited
so long for you already?
What...?
Come on give me your cell number.
Here... my business card,
freshly printed.
Ram Rajadi. 3G Businessman.
I will call you if I feel like...
And if I feel like,
I will come to meet you.
I forgot to write my
address on it, should I?
- Aey!
- Aey!
Aey!
Aey...
Aey...
Aey...
Aey...
Aey...
Well, even the peacocks want it now.
Want what?
What you want...
what I want... to make love...
Peacocks don't do all this...
...they just spread
their wings and dance.
Not dance, its romance.
See, just like before doing it,
we spread ourselves...
...they spread their wings...
Leela, what are you up to?
Hasn't your peacock left yet?
I am trying to shoo it away.
You better come down fast,
or else Kanjibhai will be here with
his gun to get rid of your peacock!
Okay, listen!
Leave! Go!
Leela!
I am coming, bhabhi!
Leela!
She is bad news to our romance!
Call me! - Yes! Leave now!
Hey listen...
Yes, tell me...
Receive your call, it's ringing.
Hmm. I was peacefully
asleep in thy heart...
...is it from there
that you pulled out my card?
Grapes are green,
Bananas appear gold,
Leela belongs to Ram
the whole world has been told.
Through the night, you have
sent 48 such stupid messages.
Where the hell are you?
After meeting you,
I have only been flying...
...in the barren desert all night,
I kept lying.
You're still at it?
Didn't you sleep at all?
A knife cuts an apple,
an apple is cut by a knife,
you worry for me like
you're already my wife.
Awesome,
so come over and make my life!
I feel like seeing you.
My Baapji is out of town...
...baby, so I will have to
manage the gun shop. You come over.
Then I will fly to you like a plane,
for it won't be in vain,
let Baa kill me,
for you I will suffer any pain.
Darling, I don't think
you Saneras are daring enough...
...to venture into enemy lane.
Don't you dare me
or I'll pull the trigger.
So go ahead, Pull it!
Lady, here's your Happy Ending shop,
give me 10 rupees in change...
I don't have any change.
Whoa hottie! It's you?
You dared me, right!
See, I am here in the Rajadi side...
...walked out from
right under Baa's nose.
Now go pay the Chhakda
driver...
Loser!
Hurry up, everyone.
Loser no... your Lover yes!
Hey! You deserve a 100!
Why did you pull down
the shutter during business hours?
I don't care about this business...
this is any ways my brother's shop...
I don't like guns, bullets or fights,
I only prefer blouses that are tight.
Looks like you are useless...
I'm sure you don't make any money?
Honey I make a lot of money!
- Really?
- Yes.
I have a 3G business!
G for Garage of stolen cars,
G for Grade C adult
films' video store...
...G for handling the
Girls of this village...
I'm a busy man you see.
Hey, busy man...
I have fallen for you, I want you.
Hey!
Your Baa doesn't own me...
...did you ask for my permission?
What if I am not interested in you?
I will make you mine...
What about your darling Karsan?
Yuck! I will shoo him away...
What if your family objects?
I will convince them...
What if I leave you?
I will kill you.
"A game of bullets and kisses."
"As playful as the love
between you and me..."
"A game of bullets and kisses."
"As playful as the love
between you and me..."
"A game of bullets and kisses."
"As playful as the love
between you and me..."
"This is... Love at war!"
"This is... Love at war!"
"This is... Love at war!"
"You're a fighter
plane but you're my life."
"Our bed is a battle field."
"You're a fighter plane
but you're my life."
"Our bed is a battle field."
"if you press the trigger,
I'll play kisses."
"if you press the trigger,
I'll play kisses."
"This is... Love at war!"
"This is... Love at war!"
"This is... Love at war!"
"This is... Love at war!"
"This is... Love at war!"
Smile please, look up a little...
That's it.
Hey bhai, enough now, go away!
Thank you.
Miss Leela!
Hey! What are you doing here?
I had left you at the temple, right?
What would have I told Baa,
had you got lost?
Nice...
What photos are these?
I am clicking pictures
of these villagers for my book.
By the way, where can I
find those naked tribal women?
You Rascal!
- I am sorry, Leela. - Scoot!
- Sorry, Leela.
Hey!
We have orders...
...to raid this place!
Move, get back!
Oh, so you have pickled
the bullets as well?
Turn on that tap...
...these buggers might
even be bathing with bullets...
Hey! So what Vanka?
You know very well we
deal in bullets, not in roses!
The license is for the shop,
not home.
It's illegal to store
bullets in the house.
Tell you what Vanka,
you've acted really well
as a Police officer,
now keep this payment
for your performance as well.
You've said this today,
don't ever say it again.
I'm an honest man.
You will have to come
to the Police station.
Come on Vanka bhai,
before we go to the police station,
why don't you come upstairs and check
the awesome stuff stashed in here.
I guarantee you will be satisfied.
What vast difference between
the two brothers... l am coming.
With a brother like
him who needs an enemy?
You are such an honest man Rambhai,
you willingly shared the information.
Oh, I have a very helpful nature,
Vanka bhai.
Leave...- Listen!
Hmm... make sure you check
every nook and corner...
...not a single bullet
should escape the eye.
Let me go.
This... is a bomb not a
bullet Rambhai... what a film!
Dirty film. Part 2.
It is fire on ice.
Fully Fresh! Full raunchy!
My guarantee!
This was the place to raid, Rambhai.
Let's assume that's what happened.
So, can I keep all these DVD's?
So, can I keep all these bullets?
Listen guys, forget the bullets,
and grab these DVD's!
Quite a colorful man you are.
I am so glad your raid was a success.
You have found the ladder to success,
now you can even jump
on Hariganga with it.
The truth is Rambhai,
I just don't understand,
had we come to raid or get raided.
That Rajadi Ram ruined the raid
and saved all the bullets.
Now those bastards
are celebrating.
And your bloody Vanka also
turned out to be a turncoat,
he got money from you
and pleasure from them.
Yes, Brother!
God bless me and my brethren!
God bless me and my brethren!
Yes, Brother!
Yes, Brother!
May no evil befall upon us ever!
For the evil has been won
over by us once again!
Yes, Brother!
God bless me and my brethren!
God bless me and my brethren!
Yes, Brother!
Hmm... you have clicked some
good pictures, Karsan bhai.
Thank you...
You should click my pictures too!
Whenever you say, Baa.
Oh, this one is special...
Take a look, Kanji.
Kanji!
If you are done counting
Rajadi bullets then look at this.
What were you doing
in the Rajadi area, Leela?
Answer me! Why did you go there?
I am asking you something, Leela!
You only asked me to show
the entire village to Karsan...
...and he insisted on seeing
the gun market. He took me there.
- But, Miss Leela...
- Shut up!
Or else I will tell everyone...
...you were after
the naked tribal girls.
Pervert!
What a cute couple...
Now we should not delay
the wedding any further...
Start the preparations.
Bhavani, you book the caterers
and that Henna girl from Surat.
And Rasila...
Yes, Baa?
Take her latest measurements.
Her wedding dress will be
made tomorrow itself. - Okay.
Oh, she is so coy.
Leela, why did you walk away?
You are so short tempered.
Did I commit a sin by
going to the Rajadi area?
It is a sin to build a
relationship with the Rajadis.
I know what's going on...
and which Peacock visits your room.
Then go ahead
snitch on me and finish the matter.
No matter what,
Baa will get you married to Karsan.
We have a lot of work,
come on let's take your measurements.
Why give measurements when
I don't want to get married...
Hmm... he is calling right?
Go ahead get us both killed!
What is it? Why are you calling me?
Why didn't you come?
Your waist size must be 28, right?
No, it might be 24,
but where are you?
And hips? Forty Two?
Forget about the hips!
Why are you taking my measurements?
Tell me, is your bosom 36?
Not 36! 136!
Come here... let me
drown in your bosom.
Enough... now stop fooling around,
there is a big problem.
Oh come here...
Tell me what has happened?
Listen I think Baa might
be aware of our love story...
...she is preponing my wedding,
something needs to be done.
So let's start by
taking your measurements...
...neck...
...like a peacock...
...long and beautiful...
and where your neck ends...
...your waist starts...
like a deer...
...so slim and appealing.
And your butt is like this garden,
it will remain here long
after I'm married and gone...
Leela?
I'm going to my room. Don't follow me!
What don't follow me,
see I have bought an adult film CD.
The title is,
Enemy Desire Pants on Fire.
First let's watch and then copy them.
You keep fooling around, but will you
ever try to understand my situation?
You think I don't understand?
There is only one
solution for our situation.
We will have to elope.
Tomorrow itself.
I will come to pick
you up at 8 o'clock.
Promise?
I guarantee it. Just be ready with
your deadly figure and fiery trigger!
Yes and I will get
snacks and sweets as well!
Did you call me sweets? - You're my
sweets. I will eat you up!
How are you Rambhai?
You look quite in the mood today!
Here he comes.
Lord Cupid is coming.
Now wait and just
listen to his tales...
So Rambhai... how was your night?
Spent the night upright... on a tree.
Actually, he was lying down.
Tell the truth, who is the girl?
Hey, the first name is amazing...
...but her last name is blazing!
Brilliant! bhai...
Make sure you watch
the news tonight...
I am about to change
Ranjaar's history.
Hello, what is going on?
Hey Kanjibhai!
Damn, spoiled the whole mood!
Forget it, Meghjibhai.
It's my job to tame the enemy.
Hasn't Radhu taught you...
...that if you spit on the sky,
you'll dirty your own face?
What do I do? Actually it's
your face... that angers me...
So I spat out the rage.
After seeing you I realized
Sanera clan has men as well.
Really? Show me one Rajadi man
who has the guts to face me.
Hey get out!
That's hardly a challenge for us now
go away... your face is such a turn off.
Hey! You rascal!
Why? Felt bad?
Will you complain to your Baa?
This gun, is my Baa.
Hey, what is the big deal...
Now my gun doesn't
like too much complaining...
...it might get angry
and blow your brains out.
Calm down Meghjibhai!
Why pull out a gun
at the drop of a hat?
I don't like this ok...
Kanjibhai, welcome to Janta Bazar.
Make love not war.
Have juice... Have tea, enjoy.
...just relax...
...and keep your cool... let it go.
Why do you fight all the time?
Those who attack from the rear,
don't have the tools
to fire from the front.
Oh, is that why you attacked us from
behind... by arranging that raid?
Meghjibhai!
Hey Kanjibhai...
...raid failed because our police
is busy chasing skirts... not bullets!
I should have killed you
on Holi itself, bloody outlaw.
Don't call me an outlaw,
brother-in-law!
I have a few lines
to say about in-laws...
Go on bhai...!
Whilst you were all busy
with their guns and triggers.
I was enjoying the
enemy's killer figure!!
Wow bhai! Very nice!
Oh you killed me... l am dead...
Enough now, get up.
Look at how well the Rajadis shoot!
Come on... take a decent shot!
This is called an aim! Sanera aim!
Now, show me.
Rascals!
Carefully, Kanjibhai. Watch out.
This bullet grazed my heart.
Oh no!
Come on take one more shot.
Break it, Kanjibhai.
That was brilliant!
Oh, lovely performance Meghjibhai!
Oscar! Oscar!
You should go Kanjibhai... now!
The soul can never be cut
into pieces by any weapon.
Nor can it be burned by fire.
Nor moistened by water.
Rasila, make sure no Rajadi
bullet stays in my Kanji's body.
He needs to go away clean.
- How could you shoot?
- Leela, listen to me!
- Please hear me out, Leela!
Ultimately you proved
you are a Rajadi!
Don't touch me Ram,
he was my only brother!
I too had just one brother.
You would've done
the same thing in my place.
I am in your place.
I have wronged you...
punish me or hold my hand.
How do I hold your hand?
I can see my brother's blood on it.
It's over.
How is it over?
How?
Now we are joined, by blood.
Let's leave from here,
else this enmity will engulf us.
Whole world is gunning for me...
...there are a 100 reasons to die,
only 1 to live...
You!
So you have embraced
your brother's killer, Leela?
Shameless, selfish & incorrigible...
But that is how love is, right?
I have lost my love, but this is
your only chance, go with him Leela.
But how can I leave Baa
and you in this situation.
It would be wrong.
It might be wrong for the world,
but for me,
your love is the
only right thing Leela.
In his anger he chose hatred,
you choose love.
Enough...
"please go away before
I change my mind."
It's Baam again.
Everything will be fine...
...now this is our life,
no fear... no revenge.
We will live happily...
...give me your word
we will never look back...
...promise me.
Who is it?
Bapu... Towel... soap, hot water.
- Don't need.
- Anything to eat, Bapu?
No nothing, go away.
Ok enjoy your honeymoon, sir.
You are still thinking
of the past, right?
I'm thinking this...
...bed might be too hard for you.
Then I'll sleep on you.
What are you thinking now?
I am thinking,
will our child be
a Rajadi or a Sanera?
Is it Baa?
You speak to her...
I will get something to eat.
I am coming with you, please.
Leela, there is Police everywhere...
...even Baa's men are looking for us.
It's dangerous outside...
- Please let me...
- I said NO!
...you sit here quietly.
What will you eat?
Should I get some snacks?
You eat the snacks...
I will eat you.
So Arjun, how is business doing?
All good with God's grace...
hey take your change!
He seems to be new in the city.
How much for this
Sindoor ?
Only 20 rupees. But it will bring you
good luck forever.
In that case take 50 rupees.
What are you doing out here?
I told you Baa's men are looking
for us, why did you step outside?
Look what I bought, Ram.
Some clothes for us,
Sindoor and these rings.
We'll have a simple wedding.
Here...
...wear this ring, our simple
wedding ceremony is done, happy?
Let's go now.
Listen! We will have
to get married properly.
How can we stay in the same
room without getting married?
What are you doing, Ram?
What are you doing, Ram?
You are worried about your wedding?
Read today's headlines.
Riots have started in Ranjaar,
Rajadi houses and shops
have been destroyed...
...things are out of control.
But you have nothing
to worry about...
...it's only the Rajadis
who are suffering.
I don't differentiate between
Rajadi or Sanera suffering.
If I did,
I wouldn't have run away with you...
...I have also left behind
my Baa. It's not easy for me.
It's not easy for me either,
even I have abandoned my family,
but you only care about yourself.
Why are you talking
about these things...
...when I am trying to forget
everything and keep you happy?
In the whole of Ranjaar,
we were the only ones who fell in
love. Now we are the ones fighting.
Because, ultimately there
is enmity in our blood, right?
But you are the ones
who started this enmity.
We didn't!
At every opportunity, you bloody
Sahara's stole from our homes...
- ...our businesses, slaughtered us...
- Why will we steal from you?
- ...did not even spare children!
- You Rajadis are nothing before us!
- Your Baa is the most...
- Don't talk about children...
- ...notorious criminal in the state!
- ...your uncle kidnapped little babies!
- Murders, extortion, smuggling...
- And you? Thief, cheat...
...if so then why did
you come with me?
- Filthy Rajadi blood
flows in your veins...
...else you wouldn't have
fired that gun! - Hey!
It's a full moon night...
...best time to get married...
...let's just do it tonight.
Bhavanibhai, the driver
has given this address only.
I give you my word, I will find
Ram Leela before sunrise tomorrow.
Their love story will be over
before 9 am tomorrow morning.
"Touch me with your soul."
"Colour me with your passion."
"Touch me with your soul."
"Colour me with your passion."
"Intoxicate me with..."
"...your burning fervour."
"Intoxicate me...
Enlighten me with your love..."
"Intoxicate me with
your burning fervour."
"My jewel and wealth is Ram,
I'm his forever."
"He's settled in every
pores of my body."
"My love is clean white,
colour it with seven colours."
"Touch me with your soul.
Colour me with your passion."
"Intoxicate me with your
burning fervour."
"The night seems barren
like a black dagger."
"The fire of desires that you
experience, I too experience it."
"Blow it and I'd burn down in it."
Burn me with yourself.
"Touch me with your soul."
"Intoxicate me with your
burning fervour."
Receive your call, it's ringing.
Receive your call, it's ringing.
Hello...
What, Ram... you left
without informing us?
Finally we found you...
We have reached your lodgings...
...are you coming down
or should we come up?
What... what are you doing here?
Have you gone crazy?
Leave right now!
Ram, we are all your friends...
...a friend in need is a
friend indeed... Am I correct bhai?
- Yes Ram...
- How did you find me?
Bhai, we would have traced you
to the depths of hell...
...it's all sorted with the police.
Come back to Ranjaar
with us without a worry.
I did not leave to return...
...you can keep your bloodshed,
your guns and bullets and be happy...
We have nothing to
do with Ranjaar any more.
That is quite apparent...
...Meghjibhai's remains have barely
been put to rest and he is...
...already in bed with that wretch.
Her name is Leela and she
is your bhabhi , OK!
I have married her...
If you ever utter her name
with your filthy mouth...
...I will cut your tongue out!
Ram, leave him. - Leave.
Let's all be sensible here...
He is married now...
...instead of congratulating him
you are fighting with him.
What congratulations?
He married a Sanera.
She is a Rajadi now...
...and also our sister-in-law.
Apologize.
Congratulate and hug him...
come on!
Come on now... Do it!
Sorry, Rambhai.
That is much better. Come,
let's sit and talk for 5 minutes.
Forget it... I am not coming.
Come on,
just have a beer with friends...
No I can't...
Hey come on,
we have travelled so far.
Can't you spare 5
minutes for your friends?
Please... Let's go!
I'll inform Leela and come...
Don't worry about her...
it's just one beer!
Come on Ram, let's go!
You married first and also celebrated
your honeymoon? Three cheers for Ram!
...and another one for Leela bhabhi!
Say cheers!
Come on Ram,
let's have one more drink...
No way, guys...
Leela is waiting... l am going.
Sure you can go to Leela bhabhi,
but first tell us something...
You left Ranjaar...
you forgot all your friends...
...you even forgot all
the other girls of Ranjaar!
What is so special
about Leela bhabhi?
Your bhabhi is one of a kind...
...special edition.
The first time we met,
instead of coloring me...
...she kissed me.
Instead of giving me her heart...
she gave me her life.
There is no one like Leela.
See...
...we are talking about her
and she calls.
Special connection!
Hello... Leela baby I love you...
I am coming soon baby...
I will be there in 5 minutes.
When will you talk to us
if you keep talking on the phone?
Forget the phone...
So what were you telling
us about Leela bhabhi?
Continue...
Ranjaar should have
a statue of Leela!
Very good idea!
She is the only Sanera
who has dared to love a Rajadi.
Very true!
I told you...
...there's no one like Leela!
Her brother's blood is on my hands...
...yet she married me.
Because there is no one like Leela...
Well done!
Well done God!
You made millions...
but there is no one like Leela...
There is...
There is... no one like Leela!
I don't want to go!
It's Buahuzoor's will...
Ram!
Ram!
Ram!
Move!
Move!
Move!
Get out of the way!
Get up!
Ram!
Ram!
Ram!
Ram!
Leela!
What a revenge! Hats off Ram!
What the hell have
you done you bastards?
What have we done? The message
was sent to Vanka from your phone.
I had trusted you all!
Even we trusted you, Ram! You left
the Rajadis to pay for your sins.
Leela!
Leela!
Leela!
Don't let him go!
Ram!
Leela!
Yes Radhubhai.
We are on our way back.
We had just stopped at a temple.
We have created history...
...by humiliating
the girl in such a way...
...that those Saneras will
never be able to face anyone.
I had sent a message
to Vanka from Ram's phone.
Now Leela will believe
that Ram has betrayed her.
Ram!
What are you doing?
This is misbehaviour. This is wrong.
You will teach me
what is right and wrong?
You scoundrels have changed the
whole definition of right and wrong.
Enough of your nonsense,
we are your friends.
Changed...
Everything has changed overnight.
The ocean of love... has
changed into a desert of hatred...
I hated enmity... it changed...
I fell in love madly
for the first time...
...left the whole world
for my love... it all changed.
Hey Ram, Ram!
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
I am checking if the
color of my blood has changed.
Is it still red...
or has it lost its color?
Enough Ram! Let's go home now.
"I've had such an enmity with you."
"That I haven't remained
like myself any more."
"That I haven't remained
like myself any more."
"This red love,
this remorse of love."
Leela, please eat something...
...you haven't eaten
at all in 3 days.
Enough is enough Leela.
What have you done to yourself?
You are calling him again, right?
You have been calling and
messaging him since 2 days...
...without any response, right?
There won't be one either.
Forget the past...
Baa has any ways called
Karsan's parents from London.
Grapes are green,
Bananas appear gold...
...Leela belongs to Ram
the whole world has been told.
What did you just say?
Knife falls on an apple
or an apple falls on a knife...
...please answer the phone,
the one calling is your wife.
What wife?
The person whose messages
you are enjoying...
...is the one who informed Vanka.
The boy has taken his revenge
Leela, by humiliating Baa and you...
...now we've become a laughing
stock in the whole of Ranjaar,
It was my mistake...
that I entrusted you to him.
I entrust Ram with my life.
The man you place so much faith in,
does not deserve it.
He proved he is a
Rajadi after all Leela...
what the hell are you doing?
Naughty granny, handsome grandfather
I have to go to Ram's house...
...how long will
I stay with my mother.
What madness is this...
...and why have you put sindoor
like a married woman?
The peacock is incomplete
without his mate...
...this sindoor in
Ram's name is my fate.
Leela, If Baa sees this,
there will be a furor. Wipe it off!
Leela...
...get this straight,
fire and water cannot co-exist.
The chant of Ram's
name sets even water afire.
Since the time she was 3,
my silly daughter wanted...
...to get married just for the
beautiful clothes and ornaments.
I have been getting jewelery made
for Leela's wedding since then.
Yes, Hujoor.
Very nice.
Baa,
Leela has refused to eat yet again.
Keep it there, I will eat it.
She has not eaten
a morsel since 3 days...
...and all you are concerned
about are the ornaments?
Rasila, gold looks beautiful
on my Leela, right?
Nothing looks good
on her any more Baa,
she has turned her
back on the world for him.
But you will not understand
their relationship.
If I didn't understand their love,
I would have punished
that Rajadi with death...
What could be a
better punishment...
...you took away their breath
and asked them to live.
This will look nice on me
for the wedding day, right?
Yes, yes, Hujoor.
Ram, that's my boy!
How well you have avenged us.
You have cut Dhankor's limbs,
you have killed her only heir and
have put her family name to shame!
Bhai... bhai... bhai
From today, Ram takes my place.
Rambhai... Rambhai...
Rambhai!
Rambhai! Rambhai!
With a gun in hand
and hatred in my heart.
...I rule the world, true that...
You all had once raised
guns at me in this court,
now in this very court
put a huge picture of me...
...as the new Rajadi don Rambhai!
Rambhai!
Henceforth let's ensure, that
every Holi is coloured in blood!
Houses burn instead
of lamps on Diwali...
Now, we live and
we die for... Saneras!
Kesar bhabhi...
I look good, right?
You too...
Sorry, Kesar bhabhi.
I won't touch your feet, won't
embrace you, won't wipe your tears.
I am a Don...
...and Dons' don't mourn,
they only celebrate.
Celebrate what?
Meghji's death or yours?
What's the difference,
Kesar bhabhi?
One body was carried out,
one was carried in.
You gave up so easily?
People take on the world
for the ones they love.
Bhabhi, who do I fight with?
My own family is my enemy.
Any ways, let me know
if you have any problem,
I will solve it. I am the Don...
...are you worried about Goli?
I will never let this happen to him.
I will change his legacy, I swear.
Anything else... no?
So leave now.
We're happy to announce
that we've a guest here.
Rambhai has become
the new Rajadi Don.
We have arranged a special
program in his honor.
And we know exactly
what Rambhai wants.
"Whether Ram wants Leela."
"Or Leela loves Ram"
"What's the world to do with
the love of these two?"
"Whether Ram wants Leela."
"Or Leela loves Ram"
"What's the world to do with
the love of these two?"
Their funda is pretty simple, dear,
If you shoot..
...It's a fight,
and if you wink, it's love..
"Whether Ram wants Leela."
"Or Leela loves Ram"
"What's the world to do with the
love of these two?"
"Keep the gun in your pocket
and keep the trigger in control."
"Keep the gun in your pocket
and keep the trigger in control."
"Whether Ram wants Leela
or Leela loves Ram."
"Whether Ram wants Leela."
"Or Leela loves Ram"
"What's the world to do with
the love of these two?"
"The clouds rain with roars.
They crave to see Leela's adorning."
"Bangles, nose-ring, and waist-band.
Make the queen as beautiful as moon."
"Ram-Leela are lovebirds."
"And the Ram-Leela is all passionate."
"Everyone looks like an enemy
and I see a thief in all."
"Everyone looks like an enemy
and I see a thief in all."
"There is a peacock sitting
on my balcony."
"It's a fault of both that
Ram-Leela is infamous."
"O my Ram, 0 my Ram."
"O, Leela!"
"Whether Ram wants Leela."
"Or Leela loves Ram"
"What's the world to do
with the love of these two?"
"There is only one bullet
and only one life."
"There is only one bullet
and only one life."
"And on every bullet, it's
written who'd die from it."
"But they deceive even
the bullet, that's how they work."
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."
"Whether Ram wants Leela."
"Or Leela loves Ram"
"What's the world to do with
the love of these two?"
Wow! That's true.
Hail Lord Rama!
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."
C'mon, everyone clap..
Leela, meet Nattubhai
and Gamaben...
Ram's parents.
And this is my daughter, Leela.
You must've heard a lot about her.
They are a wonderful family...
...Karsanbhai the Archaeologer
and father the Astrologer.
Read my palm... tell me how
many times will I get married?
Nattubhai,
how come you didn't laugh...
Leela just cracked a joke...
Our Leela is very sharp.
That's why I had told Karsanbhai...
learn how to hold a gun...
...to keep his wife in control.
Yes... Baa.
Enough of the juice!
Bhavani, give the rings.
Let's get them engaged right away.
All right...
...in that case the honeymoon
will be at a location of my choice.
At Madhuchanda Lodge, Jagatrana.
We will get a discount as well,
I have just been there.
Oh! How come you stood up,
son-in-law?
See everything else is fine,
Nattubhai...
...but he is not
as tall as our Leela.
We will have to add
heels to his wedding shoes.
Baa, why this urgency
for the wedding?
Even the mourning period for
Kanjibhai is not yet over...
I am fulfilling
Kanji's wish itself.
Karsanbhai, put the ring on!
This ring will not come off.
Bhavani give the diamond.
"This ring will stay
on my finger forever"
...and so will the
Rajadi in my heart.
I can snatch away a Lion's kill,
what is this ring on your finger?
Go ahead, try.
You are my pride,
my prestige,
if it was someone else..
Baa please!
I would have chopped
their head off.
This is my ace against your queen.
Forget about my queen,
Rambhai humiliated Dhankor so badly
that she cut her own daughter's finger.
What?
Is it true?
Wow! Leela Bhabhi
lived through the pain!
The game has changed. -How?
Ram has a full house
and Leela Bhabhi has lost one.
That's right. - Yes.
Here is my 100 bucks in the name
of Leela bhabhi's ring ceremony!
My heart crossed swords with yours,
In a feud as flawed as love.
A love that changed my very name...
My name is love,
Your name is love,
My name is love,
Your name is love,
My name is love,
Your name is love,
My name is love,
My love is red.
The red of remorse,
Of rivalry and regret.
"This red love, this remorse of love."
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."
"This red love, this remorse of love."
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."
"This red love, this remorse of love."
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."
Rasila, take these clothes
and ornaments, they are for Leela.
Get her dressed
and bring her down.- Yes, Baa.
- So well everything is going...
- Dhankor Baa...
We are thinking of delaying...
...the wedding by a few days,
let's all lake it a little slow...
Oh Nattubhai, what slow, the
groom is already coloured yellow.
All the other women have completed the
ritual, now it's your turn Buahujoor.
From London comes the groom's
family, riding haughty and high,
We won't let them go,
stay here or die!
Dhankor Baa, please let us go...
...you can't build this
relationship at gun point.
At least return
Karsan's passport Baa.
This is plain torture.
Plane... oh yeah, we shall book
your plane tickets tomorrow.
Enough! Dhankor Baa. Enough.
Wow! You are holding a gun,
the boy is ready for the wedding.
Our bespectacled groom,
we thought was a little shy,
but look he's holding
a gun... oh my my!
Hey Leela, see what I've brought.
Baa got such beautiful ornaments
and clothes made for you.
Your wedding is set for this
Thursday and so much to be done!
Get ready soon and come down,
guests have started arriving...
Marriage is so amazing,
Rasila bhabhi.
You should also get married again.
Have you lost your mind?
If you can't get married again,
then how can I?
My husband is still alive.
Baa can get me married
to anyone she wants...
but I will consummate
my marriage only with Ram.
Shameless!
Shameless, incorrigible, selfish...
...but that is how love is.
Now don't look so shocked,
go and tell him,
I will wait for him
near the dry well tonight.
You want me to go
to Ram's area?
And ask my husband's
murderer to sleep with you?
You do care for me, right?
He is now the Don of the Rajadis...
...revenge, hatred, guns and bullets.
That's what he lives for now.
Neither will he answer your calls,
nor will he meet me,
you very well know what
answer I will come back with.
This relationship is over now.
My first night will be with
Ram or this will be my last night.
Few songs were demanded
from me to sing.
I'll sing a couple of lines.
From the movie, 'I've seen the
country as well as the foreign land.'
Where is Rambhai's shop?
This... is the one.
- Is he inside?
- Should be...
Oh Rasila bhabhi? What
are you doing in our Video store?
Welcome, please come in...
I am shocked to see you here...
Are you also interested
in "action" films?
We are watching one right now,
come join us, please
sit... enjoy yourself...
I need to meet Ram.
Not Ram, call him Rambhai.
I need to meet Rambhai.
Say "please"...l
need to meet Rambhai.
Please, I need to meet Rambhai.
You had your fun?
Now call Ram... I have
an important message for him.
But Rambhai is not here.
I know he is inside, I will
go and look for him myself...
Rambhai is the new
Don of the Rajadis.
Did you take an appointment
to see him, Rasilaji?
No? So you can't meet him.
Listen, I have to deliver
an important message to him.
It is for his own good.
Isn't it wonderful...
First Dhankor did
"good" to Rajadis...
...and now Rasilaji
has come as our saviour.
Give us a chance,
we can also do some "good",..
...since Saneras have no men left.
Bastard...
Go away!
Rambhai is not here...
...whatever you want to say,
say it in my ears.
You disgusting animal!
Leave me!
Sanera women, sharp and cheeky.
Oh Look...
...your blouse is all wet.
Let me help you dry it.
Leave me.
Take it.. - Leave.. leave me.
Hey, leave her.
Leave her alone.
Stop, have you all lost it?
You want revenge
from a helpless woman?
If Rambhai hears of this,
he will kill every one of you.
My husband was right...
There are no men in the Rajadis.
- Want to see my manhood?
- Hey!
If you even try to touch me
this time... I will rip you apart.
Now, go and tell your Rambhai...
Leela will never be his.
This is my promise.
Rasila bhabhi, what did Ram say?
Tell me...
...what happened bhabhi?
Please, what was his answer?
This is what those Rajadis did.
Hey look there...
"stop!"
Run away!
Ah... here is her shawl...
the wretch must be around!
You bloody Kesar I won't spare you!
Let's go!
Now its war in Ranjaar!
We will teach them a lesson
for trying to touch our women.
Veer, Mandar,
Velji, Pranjeevan, come here.
Our revenge will start right here,
right now!
Yes, brother!
The first bullet,
will be fired on them.
"If we can't punish these bastards"
"these rapists, then
throw away your guns!"
You avenged your brother's
death right away...
...today when it's about our women,
you are giving us a lecture?
What revenge are you
talking about Rambhai?
You want us to abandon our guns?
so here!
I asked you to abandon your guns...
not your manhood.
Will the Saneras stop
even if we abandon our weapons?
I can see,
the end is near for the Rajadis.
How could Radhubhai
crown you as our Don?
Hey, stop!
You BastardmBuahujoor...
kill him right now...
This tone has to change.
Our guns are done talking...
...now the time has
come for us to talk.
Oh Rambhai, we could've discussed
this over the phone as well.
Why did you take the
trouble to come here?
My mobile number is 9285000011...
any ways its Navratri, you're fortunate
to witness the Goddess herself.
Take prasaad .
Pride against pride,
an eye for an eye, enough of this.
I am standing right here,
unarmed, kill me...
...if that's what
brings your son back.
And one last thing, we Rajadis respect
and protect our women with our lives.
And if you doubt that, try
building a relationship with us.
Long live Lord Ram!
Goli, see who's calling?
Uncle, unknown number... 9285000011
say...
Rambhai, you recognized my number?
A real man's voice echoed
in this mansion after long.
You were right,
let's build a relationship.
And hey Leela, where are you going!
She was sitting right here,
but at the mention of your name,
she blushed and ran away.
Tomorrow is the first night
of Navratri celebrations,
You must come.
My official invitation,
Must be at your doorstep by now.
I hope you appreciate
my offering Rambhai.
Actually, these Peacocks were
making too much noise around here.
We are enemies no more...
...so I hope you will be
there tomorrow night?
Baa,
if the invitation is so fancy,
then your hospitality will
be worth experiencing.
I will be there.
Get ready.
Thank you...
Alright then, see you tomorrow...
Rest in Peace...
oh I mean may your day be peaceful.
If he is a lover,
then I am a killer.
For the first time in Ranjaar, a
man has fought for a woman's honor.
Be it Rajadi or Sanera...
For us you are our Don Rambhai.
This turban is for
every woman's pride.
Rambhai...
bhai... bhai...
As I await for my true love,
I dance without shackles...
My pulse races to
the beat of every drum,
And I wait for you to come
and change the rhythm of the life.
"Hey, drums beat. Come fast.
Open the shackles of my feet."
"Drums beat."
"Drums beat with the kettle-drums
with huge sounds."
"Drums beat."
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."
"There is knocking on the door."
"But he hasn't yet come."
"Since then, yeah, since then
I've been waiting.."
"Now open your arms and come."
"My heart roams here and there in joy,
getting all restless."
"The words of my beloved
speak out loud."
"Drums beat."
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."
"Drums beat."
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."
"Hey, drums beat. Come fast."
"Open the shackles of my feet."
"Drums beat."
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."
"Drums beat."
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."
"This green lemon-tree.-"
"..and green betel-tree."
"O Lord, don't refuse.."
"Please have a little stay
at my house."
"I'll not stay."
"As Goddess Sita is
waiting at my home."
"Sita, Alone there.."
"..waits for Ram and Lakshman."
"Every moment passes in agony."
"Now come and dance with me."
"Why do you shiver so much."
"Now don't be afraid of your heart."
"Peacocks now speak in the gardens."
"And the geography of
my heart has changed."
"Drums beat."
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."
"Drums beat."
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."
"Hey, drums beat. Come fast.
Open the shackles of my feet."
"Drums beat."
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."
"Drums beat."
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."
"Drums beat."
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."
"Drums beat."
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."
"Drums beat."
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."
"Drums beat."
"This green lemon-tree.-"
"..and green betel-tree."
"O Lord, don't refuse.."
"Please have a little stay
at my house."
"I'll not stay."
"As Goddess Sita is
waiting at my home."
"Sita, alone there.."
"..waits for Ram and Lakshman."
After what happened to Baa, it is
hard to trust anyone, Bhavani bhai.
Thankfully, by God's grace,
Buahujoor is alive.
But the wound is deep,
her condition is still critical.
Now just wait and
watch Rasila bhabhi,
I will not spare that Ram
and those wretched Rajadis.
Bhavani bhai, it is not
the time to discuss these things.
This is the time
indeed Rasila bhabhi,
Now the silent film is over
and the action shall begin.
Henceforth I will
be calling the shots...
...and my decision
is blood for blood.
Not blood for blood Bhavani bhai,
blood in the place of blood.
"Leela will take Baa's place"
...that's mine and the
entire Sanera clan's decision.
You may confirm if you want.
What the hell does Leelaben
know about our business?
I have learnt from Buahujoor
since I was 5 years old,
this business is my entire life.
You've been learning
since you were 5,
she has learned in the womb.
Even Abhimanyu had
learned in the womb Rasila bhabhi,
yet he could not brave
the conspiracies of war.
It's time to change Baa's
dressing... go call the Doctor.
Who gave you the right
to decide for me?
You know how much
I hate all this...
...this business, this bloodshed.
And yet you are forcing me into this.
This is your legacy Leela
and you cannot change it.
Use your mind,
If Bhavani takes over
he will destroy Ranjaar.
Now it's your call.
You should've completed
thejob Radhubhai.
A wounded Tigress
is always more dangerous.
Pujalal just as you are flying
a kite... in a sky without breeze,
our enemy was shot at,
without us even firing.
If we all start cutting
each other's kites the way you do,
then our underworld
will be doomed. Am I correct?
But what is the proof...
...that the Rajadis
have shot Dhankor.
When a snake is wounded,
only a mongoose is to blame
Radhubhai. Isn't it Rambhai?
We have decided, a compromise
is the only option for you.
Don't worry,
meeting has already been fixed...
...at Dhankor's house to be
presided over by the village head.
If compromise is inevitable,
then bring Dhankor here,
if she apologizes, then so will we.
I will go there...
...tomorrow evening at 6,
confirmed.
Ram...
Come on Baapji...
I am the Don.
How is Dhankor feeling now,
Bhavani?
If she's better,
can we go and speak to her?
That's not required Sir,
Hujoor is coming here.
Look everyone,
how strong Dhankor is...
...she is up and
about within 2 days.
Really impressive...
Hey Bhavani bhai,
this is ridiculous.
Now we have to discuss
business with a kid?
Are there no men
left in this house?
This business was never
dependent on any man, Pujalal.
All their cargo comes via
our Mundhra ships, right Ujjwal?
Yes hujoor.
Starting tomorrow,
let them find another way.
As you say, Hujoor.
Is Dhankor feeling
better now, dear?
Yes, with Goddess Am he's blessings.
Now I am handling everything.
So I stay very busy. You must be
very busy too, with the elections.
Yes the elections
are approaching my dear,
but nothing will be possible
without your support.
And we will get your
support only when...
Baa has been wounded deeply, sir.
And at her age, it takes
time for the wounds to heal.
That is exactly why we wanted
you all to talk face to face.
Face to face?
These Rajadis should
be sitting behind.
So they can easily
stab us in the back.
See the thing is, Saneras and Rajadis
have been enemies for over 500 years,
and because of this enmity,
business is hampered,
too much blood has been shed...
...we are losing both,
money and lives.
That is why we want
both of you to unite.
At least someone wants us to unite.
I can't let that happen Sir,
they killed my brother.
Even my brother was killed, Sir.
They tried to rape
my sister-in-law!
They tried the same on our women!
- They shot my mother!
- They took away my wife!
If you avenged everything else,
then why not this?
Guns were fired in name of
compromise, why not avenge that?
Avenge broken promises, avenge
running away from responsibilities!
Whole world ridiculed us,
why not avenge that?
Any ways, not everyone is
capable of loving their enemy.
Alright Sir, consider
this over from my end as well.
Here is your compromise.
Henceforth,
there will be no relationship...
"between any Sanera and Rajadi."
Starting today,
our paths will never cross.
As far as business goes...
...you will manage
the tobacco business...
...and we will handle
the arms smuggling.
Hey! Popat make a note...
...we will stay intoxicated, as we
have handed over our senses to them.
The sea route will be ours...
...roads will be yours.
That's appropriate.
Popat, get ready
for a bland life...
...for the seas and
salt belong to them now.
There will be no exchange
of bullets, food grains or girls.
Write...
starting today we won't shoot,
won't eat, won't even get married.
"Since we have sorted everything...
let's embrace once and seal the deal"
These people have
stabbed us in the back,
- now they want to embrace?
- Bhavani.
These Rajadis have
tried to kill Buahujoor!
"If we give them any more chances"
"these rascals will
enter our house and..."
...spit on us!
Bring over the spittoon...
The spittoon.
Here...
We have carted around
dead bodies for long..
...It's time now to focus
on business. - What is it huzoor.
Don't you feel comfortable
on this seat...
...is that why you are
scared to take revenge?
Hey!
If she were a coward,
she would've attacked from behind...
...not loved openly.
Ok Sir, the decision is final.
Now let's be enemies...
...in love.
Bhai... bhai...
bhai... bhai...
Relax losers... it's
just my cellphone!
Hujoor, one photo please...
Hey Popat...
...this should be
on Twitter by tonight...
...and in the papers
by tomorrow morning.
Ram-Leela unite...
Rambhai...
Rambhai...
Come on Popat! Let's leave...
Gujarat's Home
Minister has spent...
...more than 8 crores on his...
...daughter's wedding, the social
workers are protesting against that.
Tomorrow is the
last day of Ramleela.
Police on high alert...
This year the Goddess' sacrament
will be distributed by you...
I will take you there.
How are you... Buahujoor.
- These are some important documents...
- I am sitting with Baa right now.
It's urgent... this is the agreement
made with the Rajadis yesterday...
Please go through them once...
You have read it right?
Don't worry Baa,
everything is running smoothly.
We have doubled
the extortion rates,
all the murder charges
in your name have been settled.
We are filing our tender
for Ahmedabad highway.
That contract has
to be ours Bhavanibhai...- Yes.
Even Pankaj bhai has been sorted...
No problem at all, you go
ahead and sign. We will manage...
Some people are waiting
for you in the hall...
It's amazing how you
have been managing all this.
It doesn't hurt any more, Baa.
Your order has arrived Radhubhai.
It's the latest stock, even Sahara's
don't have it. It's special.
How is this special Panna bhai?
These guns don't take lives, is it?
Get this placed in the store room.
Ram this is not the
time to store these guns.
It's time to pick them up.
Ever since you took over, our guns and
ammunition business has fallen flat.
That cunning girl...
...has allotted all
the failing businesses to us.
And has taken over all
the big contracts herself.
I must say Baapji, you are very lucky
to have such a smart daughter-in-law.
You think she will
be able to forget all this?
Im possible!
How can she ever forget me?
She will definitely
take her revenge.
Even though someone
else may have shot Dhankor.
What's shooting and killing father?
With a single arrow passing
through both our hearts,
she and I still go on living...
Hey, see!
Ram Leela's photo! Directly
from Twitter to the front page...
Frame this photo and hang it.
There should be at least one
photo of the married couple, right?
- Ram!
- To celebrate our wedding,
this time Rajadis will burn Havana's
effigy in Ranjaar!
Ujjwal, this year Ravana looks
a lot like that Rajadi Don, right?
That Ram along with his Rajadis...
...is eagerly looking forward
to burn the effigy, Bhavani bhai.
That will happen only if
they manage to reach here, right?
Leelaben has made a huge mistake by
signing the orders without reading.
Now no Rajadi will be spared.
That's a brilliant
plan Bhavani bhai...
...now that seat will be yours.
The seat is guaranteed Ujjwal.
I spent my entire
bloody life for it...
I shot my own Buahujoor for it...
How can I let Leela use
this seat to further her romance?
Now I will put an end to
this love story once and for all.
Hello everyone,
hello brothers and their sisters...
For the evil Ravana of Ranjaar...
...it's the doom day, in the barren
desert flowers would bloom today.
Welcome to the last day
of Ram-Leela .
Look at how Ramji walks.
Look at the audacity in his eyes.
Look at how Ramji walks.
Look at the audacity in his eyes.
Here goes Lord Ram...
carrying his bow and arrow...
On one side is army of evil...
on the other side is goodness
of Lord Hanumaan...
Long live Lord Ram!
Let goodness prevail!
Lord Ram returns home today, we
rejoice, a thousand lamps we light,
"O beloved!"
"O beloved!"
The war will start now.
On the day of festival,
Leela has killed innocent Rajadis.
She hasn't even spared women.
Read her orders.
Orders to kill the Rajadis...
...orders to kill us!
Hey Manga, let Ram know that his wife
shall die at the hand of Rajadis.
- Please Radhubhai, have some
faith in law. - Enough!
It's time for us
to take the law in our own hands!
For Lord Ram every
moment without Sita,
was a moment full of poison.
As Ram and Sita unite today,
let the lamps burn.
It's time to burn the evil,
It's time for Ranjaar
to give up arms!
Long live Lord Ram!
You may sit.
Hujoor, these people have come
all the way from Ahmedabad...
...to discuss an urgent matter.
"It is time for the
religious rituals to begin"
"cancel all the
meetings after this."
Ok Hujoor...
Oh, you still haven't gone home?
Haven't you returned
his passport yet, Ujjwal?
I got my passport Leelaji.
Thanks to you,
I can finally go home.
Thank you so much.
I will never be able to forget you.
Me too.
Where is Bhavani?
Bhavanibhai has gone
to finish your work, Hujoor.
- Regarding the orders you had passed.
- What orders?
The orders you signed
the other day...
I must say Hujoor,
what brilliant orders.
You managed to do what
no other Don has ever done before.
This is the best
Dassera for Saneras.
But what have I done?
The ultimate coup!
Rajadi's were on their
way to burn the Ravana's effigy,
but you went ahead
and got their Ram killed!
- What did you say?
- Yes Hujoor...
Yes Hujoor... That Rajadi Rambhai
has been killed on his own chariot.
"Some Astrologer had predicted,"
"that this year Ravana
won't burn in Ranjaar."
Now see Ravana
will burn at the hands of Saneras.
You are a Goddess for us, Hujoor.
Long live Hujoor!
Long live Hujoor!
Long live Hujoor!
Long live Hujoor!
Hail Goddess Am be!
Hail Goddess Am be!
Hail Goddess Am be!
Go ahead... immerse the idol.
Tell me sarpanch ...
Looks like the Rajadis are being
immersed this year in their own blood.
Ranjaar's Dassera has been
colored red this time.
Don't speak in riddles...
Ujjwal, what is he trying to say?
What will he tell you?
I will explain.
The truth Dhankor, is that
the Rajadis are being murdered..
...In each and every
corner of this village.
Ram Leela had made an agreement,
but you did not honor it.
I did not expect
this of the Saneras.
If only hatred was taught... then
how did Ram Leela fall in love?
Rajadi woman!
That's right.
Meghji's widow, Kesar.
You succeeded in wiping off Rajadis
from face of Ranjaar.
This is my son,
Rajadi's last living heir.
Kill him as well.
Then there will
be no love and no war.
Maa!
Ranjaar's women waste their time
giving birth to boys, raising them.
It only takes a single bullet
of your enmity to take their lives.
She is right Baa...
...with every bullet
fired not only a son...
...but even a mother dies.
I am thankful to Goddess Ambe
for not giving me a child.
You look shocked to see me alive.
You coolly signed those orders...
Ram, Ram, Ram! So many
Rajadis have been murdered...
...now they are coming to kill you.
So have you come to save me?
No I have come to kill you.
You turned out to be as wretched as
you are beautiful.
Even you think that
I passed those orders?
No..
In that case how am I wretched?
Because you fell
in love with a Rajadi.
A love story should not be so toxic
that innocent people die.
Now you look like
the Leela I fell for.
Now you also look like
the Ram I fell in love with.
Listen,
I have to tell you a secret.
What secret?
For the first time ever...
my gun is loaded.
You naughty Peacock!
Hey 136...I will change
my mind if you come so close.
When we should've
made love... we didn't.
Now, even that Peahen is pregnant,
but look at us...
...didn't get it from the only one
I have ever loved.
I didn't get it from anyone.
How I always thought I would
get you the "morning after" pill...
...and how it's come
to evening bullets now.
I wanted us to have 18 kids.
That's funny, didn't take the exams
and yet want the results!
Come on...
...time is running out, our 'marriage'
convoy has reached Patel wadi.
We cannot die at their hands.
You own my life and I own yours.
With us gone,
the enmity in Ranjaar will be over.
Now you decide, who kills you...
the enemy or the lover?
What is your size?
Shirt is large,
for the pants it's extra large.
But why are you asking
for my measurements now?
Don't you want an outfit,
for the last rites?
Take this gun.
Don't you want revenge?
Uncle Ram says
if we forego revenge,
then the barren desert
shall bear flowers.
You address Kesar as Maa?
Everyone here calls me Baa.
Not this time, Buahujoor,
It's taken a lot of effort to
wipe out the Rajadis from Ranjaar.
I will not let this
opportunity slip away.
Hey Rajadi, it's a full moon night...
perfect time... let's do it tonight.
Last time we tried
doing it remember..
"They scared the life
out of us by pelting stones..."
...this time,
they will fire bullets.
Any last wish?
Sarpanch please send a message
to the Rajadis...
The Saneras and Rajadis will
celebrate Dassera together this time.
Bhai, bhai, bhai.
Rasila, start the preparations...
...today we will
send off Leela with Ram.
Hail Goddess Am be!
Do you hear the firing downstairs?
Your in-laws have arrived.
Show me, how good your aim is?
Your bullet should pierce my heart.
Just like the first time.
On the count of three...
Leela!!
The bad news is here.
Leela, Baa is calling
you downstairs, come quickly!
Listen...
Tell me...
Leela!
Leela!
That Dassera,
first time in 500 years
Rajadis and Saneras burnt the
effigy of evil Ravana, together.
Leela and Ram departed
amidst grand fanfare.
That last gunshot fired..
...by Ram Leela in name
of love still echoes...
and never has there been
a gun fired since in Ranjaar.
No longer are houses burned,
only lamps are lit.
If anger and revenge can turn
an ocean into a barren desert...
...then true love can also
make flowers bloom here.
"This red love, this remorse of love."
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."
"This red love, this remorse of love."
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."
"Love, love, love.."
"I have had such an enmity with you."
"I have had such an enmity with you."
"That I haven't remained
like myself any more."
"That I haven't remained
like myself any more."
"My name is love."
"Your name is love."
"My name is love."
"Your name is love."
""My name, your name,
my name, it's all love."
"This red love, this remorse of love."
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."
"This red love, this remorse of love."
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."
"Love, love, love.."
"Should I change my name.."
"..or should I hide your name?"
"Or should I just leave all the
memories and become a hermit?"
"So that there is just one work,
love, for me."
"My work be love,
love be my work."
"My name is love.
Your name is love."
""My name, your name, my name.."
"..it's all love. This red love,
this remorse of love."
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."
"This red love, this remorse of love."
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."
"I have had such an enmity with you."
"That I haven't remained
like myself any more."
"That I haven't remained
like myself any more."
"My name is love."
"Your name is love."
"My name is love. Your name is love."
"My name is love. Your name is love."
""My name, your name,
my name, it's all love."
"This red love, this remorse of love."
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."
"This red love, this remorse of love."
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."
"This red love, this remorse of love."
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."
