APRIL TO PARIS
DEPARTMENT OF STATE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
- Hello, Mr Putnam.
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr Putnam.
- You were not careful.
Hi, Tracy.
- Everything is squared?
- Affirmative.
Very good.
S. WINTHROP PUTNAM
ASSISTANT TO THE ASSISTANT
DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE
The letter, sir.
In fact, the French still insists
to see you.
- It is not immigration?
- It was sent to Justice
who sent the Treasury,
who has returned here.
The usual channels.
What is his complaint?
This is the third time he comes here.
I'm really busy with the festival,
but let him come.
You made me look?
Find a place.
If you get there.
Fouquet, my secretary has already said
nothing could.
- I must be in Paris next week.
- Your passport is in order.
- You can go whenever you want.
- When I want.
But I have no money for my ticket.
And I can not fly by myself.
I spent all winter
to earn dollars Yankee
but I do not
Yankee every penny.
The Treasury had to lock all your money
to count how much tax you owe.
- How long?
- One week, two weeks. One month.
A month?
No money, no wine, no women?
Is this a way for man to live
unless you are American?
Sorry, but what are the rules.
I can not do anything.
In France, I am a famous artist.
I have my own cabaret.
At the bank, I francs
not knowing what to do.
I'll call Paris
and ask them to send me money.
I can?
- Yes.
- Okay.
But we must grasp
as soon as it arrives.
Charming.
It will soon
spring in Paris.
Children dancing
the Bois de Boulogne.
Men will be selling hot chestnuts
in small trucks in the street.
Chestnuts.
And everywhere, young couples
will be entwined, kissing.
Have pity for a man who is not breathing,
only lives and loves when he is in Paris.
You lend me enough to leave?
It is against the rules.
- In second class?
- Impossible.
- In steerage?
- It is also against the rules.
Coat me fat
I'm going to swim across.
- It's ...
- I know.
It is also against the rules.
I will wait to see a wizard
above you.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not
to criticize your government,
but there are only regulations.
Forms, red tape, efficiency,
no room for error.
What would happen to this giant machine
if only one small human error
it slipped?
Things would not be as square,
believe me.
This mechanism would make the delicate balance ...
There is something terrible happened.
- What's going on?
- I'm off to New York.
Tell the Harvard Club
I miss dinner.
Tell them anything.
Invent.
- I know what's wrong.
- What?
He mixed the letters
Festival in Paris
and sent the invitation Ethel Barrymore
a dancer.
A dancer?
I'd better make his cartoons.
One minute, Mr. Putnam.
Why this whirlwind trip
from Washington?
The Festival of Paris is canceled?
Any statement will come from the wizard.
I am his assistant.
But the Festival of Arts is you.
It seems that you take
a representative of the theater.
That it will be,
Ethel Barrymore or Bugs Bunny?
Very funny.
Representatives of various arts
come the best of the United States.
Sorry to disappoint you,
but everything is going very well.
Why have caught
the first cap and took a plane?
I caught nothing at all,
as you so vulgarly.
This is a scheduled visit there for weeks.
I wish you a good day.
- A further statement.
- Mr. Putman.
Knickerbocker theater.
Make sure nobody is following us.
Okay, Dick Tracy,
this will be our little secret.
Knickerbocker THEATRE PRESENTS
THE GREAT MUSICAL SUCCESS:
"IT MUST BE OWL"
It will $ 5.
Hold.
Say, and the tip?
Your rates are set by the Commission.
They will provide a living wage.
You want to marry me for my money?
Gratuities are unworthy
and anti-American. They should be abolished.
I'll give you some advice.
Do not cross the street.
It is a big organization.
Close the door.
- Where is your heel?
- My what?
You have a ticket
or is it to get warm?
I have no ticket.
I'm traveling on official
for the government.
I'd like to see ...
Miss Ethel S. Jackson.
- Where can I find it?
- Dynamite Jackson?
Come here.
It must be nice
Love every street corner
This is the third from the left.
twinge
It must be nice
A beautiful plant, right?
It must be nice
One way to heaven
It makes us peasants
A society full of people
That must be really cool
It says
not rewrite history
Since we are bewitched
We can not fight
Whoever said
That man was not made of wood
understand
It must be nice
Yes, really cool
The only remedy to celibacy chronic
Go put a price
For shoes, rice
Marked  "She" and "Him"
You will see that love
Is all that tells
Cole Porter asked
What is love?
If you have not been answered yet
Dear Mr. Porter
is what we do not know what love is
But we can tell you what it looks
is the least we can do
You listen, Porter
It must be nice
Yes, really cool
The only remedy to celibacy chronic
Go put a price
For shoes, rice
Marked  "She" and "Him"
And you will see that love
Is all that tells
Love is all that is said
Love is all that is said
Love is all that is said
A beautiful plant, right?
Sit down.
Thank you.
Surprise!
- It's all for me?
- Stop doing the baby
and open your gifts. We gotta go.
- A nightgown.
- You like?
- So?
- Superb.
- Splendid.
- Put that when they say:
"Women and children first"
they know.
Slippers and perfume.
The girls adore.
And a dictionary.
Everything I need.
- And the invoice.
- Give me that.
How it got there?
Girls.
Where did you get the money for it?
We refuse to answer
because it could put us in question.
Do not look at me, I'll cry.
- Take that.
- Go ahead.
Where can I find Miss Jackson?
We must wait outside with the others.
You do not understand,
I represent the government.
- Our government?
- Yes.
It is worse than I thought.
On stage.
Donna, you wanted some cake?
A big part.
I ask you forgiveness.
Miss Jackson?
A speech.
No.
We want  Jackson.
I do not know what to say.
Imagine the government choose me
to represent the American theater
Festival of Paris.
Why not?
I could not believe it
when I received the letter.
I must be a representative sample.
Or perhaps it is
because I represent the equity?
Tomorrow everything will be more
a big mistake.
Miss Jackson ...
I guess everyone has the right,
once in his life,
a great moment.
This is mine, this is my big moment.
I'll remember all my life.
If someone says that I cried,
I knocks.
If it is not already.
- Bon voyage.
- Promised.
Do nothing that I would not do.
If you can hold you back.
Goodbye.
Thank you again, girls.
Miss Jackson?
Zippers.
I would like to introduce myself.
I beg you.
S. Winthrop Putnam
Department of State.
I'm sorry.
Magic.
I imagine any old
with a beard before.
- Forgive me if I disappointed you.
- No.
- You agree very well.
- Thanks.
Can I put the cake?
I've had enough.
You have the passport and the ticket?
The boat leaves on Friday.
That's what I want to talk about.
- You go there all the time, I guess?
- Where?
In Europe, I mean.
I've never been anywhere
where the subway does not drive.
And now I'm off to Paris, France.
Thanks to you.
I could kiss you for that.
- That's what I'll do.
- No, Miss Jackson.
In your speech,
you were talking to an error.
- And then?
- That's exactly what happened.
There was a letter to Ethel Jackson
about a work permit
a cabaret
in Montreal, I think.
Do not worry about it.
Can I cancel Montreal to Paris.
Only the Eskimos there.
And there was a letter
for Miss Ethel Barrymore
asking
to represent the United States
International Arts Festival.
I'm sorry.
I hope you understand.
Everything is canceled?
That's right.
Sorry to have confused the letters.
Sure.
Imagine Ethel Barrymore
play in this rat trap in Montreal?
The State Department would appreciate
you do not tell anyone.
The Department of Justice
would investigate,
This would be a bit annoying,
because it is we who are investigating them.
Imagine the girls.
They are put into four
for all these gifts ...
It is the most beautiful thing
that ever happened to me.
And now ...
Miss Jackson, I know exactly
what you feel.
How can you?
When I was a kid in Boston
my father bought me a rifle.
A 22 mm, I was 12.
I had never seen anything more beautiful.
We were out hunting in Maine
and I caught chickenpox.
Why do not you be fired?
It's your fault,
you have confused the letters.
Without you, I would not have been
so enthusiastic.
- I can do something?
- Yes.
Add it to your friend in Washington.
I will not need it.
- If you listen to my version ...
- Exit.
You'll grow a beard.
Next year I am voting for Anthony Eden.
April in Paris
chestnut flowers
tables are out
Under the trees
April in Paris
Feeling
That person could never
Painter
I never knew
The charm of spring
'd never hit so close
I do not know
That my heart could sing
No warm embrace
had never missed
Till April in Paris
to turn to?
What did you make me
heart
Hello, Mr. Putnam.
Mr. Sherman is waiting for you, Mr. Putnam.
He learned the good news.
- Really?
- Go ahead.
At the right loan.
I know what you mean, sir,
and I deserve it.
I congratulate you, my boy,
it is good work.
I am in Department 10 years
and it was the diplomatic mission
The most difficult
from an explorer
was lost at the Pentagon.
Imagine naming a dancer
to represent the American theater.
- I take full responsibility.
- It was a stroke of genius.
Oh yeah?
I do not know how the news services
have known, but I'm delighted.
Look at all these telegrams.
You have captured the popular imagination.
I saw the young lady and told her ...
"A representative of ordinary people."
She threw my hat
and her babydoll face.
The Department of Labour:
"250,000 new voters."
And Anthony Eden.
Winthrop, here passports
for our group.
Joshua Stevens
the greatest American artist.
Sinclair Wilson
our greatest man of letters.
Joseph Weimar
one of our greatest composers.
And "Miss Ethel S. Jackson."
How to describe?
Just say: "A beautiful plant."
This is top secret
or any girl can she get?
- Marcia.
- Hello, darling.
That's nothing.
And so, for something.
Congratulations, honey.
I heard your feat.
How to do you think?
It came to me by sending a letter.
I just talked to Senator Owen.
There is a vacancy
Council of Labour.
One member of the board
back to work.
We accept no small job.
We want the seat of Massachusetts
the Senate.
Oh yeah? Is large enough
for both of us?
Right now, you're the darling
Capitol Hill.
What you have done is perhaps
a springboard to the White House.
Come, do not we dream a little too much?
I do not have the qualifications.
No, it's too wacky.
Never doubt the power of a woman
who wants to be First Lady.
Goodbye, darling.
- Continue like that.
- I'll go with you.
You have more important things to do.
- Dad will accompany me.
- Come, my dear.
Dad, can you assign
a larger office in Winthrop?
I could demote
and give him mine.
Maybe.
As a wedding gift.
-  Yes, sir
- Tracy?
Send a telegram
Miss Ethel S. Jackson.
At 128 West 48th Street,
in New York.
The plans have changed.
Pack your bags
to be picked up.
At 16 pm tomorrow to embark.
Signed, the President.
Who
S. Winthrop Putnam, of course.
Ladies and gentlemen,
President of the United States.
Mr. President of Congress, Mr. President
of the House of Representatives.
Dear Members of Congress.
I have the honor to submit
My report on the state of the Union
is an honor and a privilege
A privilege and an honor
come to this day
to repeat
Let each of our 48 states
East, as I will soon show
certainty and absolute
And I say in a firm
that you understand
Each state is thriving
my last interview with the firm
There were no debt
The budget is balanced
credit
Did I say balanced
I withdraw the word
We are more that balancing
You will be pleased to know
What we found money

I therefore reaffirm
And I said to my
Sixth  term
What  all 48 states
East, as I will soon show
one certainty and absolute
I say definitely
that you understand
Each state is thriving
robins sing around me
Life, what a delight
Do not think power

That life can be more fun
That  Barnum and Bailey
Gay as a lark
Life, what a delight
moods, I do not know
I come
Life, what a delight
Life will be a joy every day
Life, what a delight today
Who would have thought a French
would borrow
another French United States?
No, really, you saved my life.
Here is your reservation.
- The Royal Suite on the main deck.
- Thank you, sir.
- I'm here.
- Simone, my little pigeon.
- Philippe.
- You also go by boat?
You remember our last trip?
From this last night?
You remember this, this and that?
We continue?
The first few minutes,
it is always like that.
You get the picture.
I think so. This is my wife.
Exactly.
- Here I am, gentlemen.
- Professor Weimar.
You know Sinclair Wilson
Joshua Stevens?
Very good. They left
In my last concert.
Our government is about
to launch another noble experiment.
Three of the greatest minds of this country
will travel to Paris with a dancer.
Everything happens to me with 20 years behind.
Trent.
Dad.
I knew you forget your pills.
Me too.
Dad,
I should not go to sea?
Everyone does,
even dancers.
It is a terrible grip on Winthrop.
Do not show him your concern.
- You can see it?
- As an old petticoat.
Let him go alone.
When he is in Paris,
He will care for you in Washington.
Very good. You're a clever mind.
I look like my daughter.
- What's the holdup?
- Where is he?
He sought Miss Jackson
home.
Miss Jackson, open this gate.
Did you get my telegram?
Yes, Western Union
would not send my reply.
Go.
- How did you get?
- I have a friend at the FBI.
And the Red Cross?
I know I've treated
meanly,
but you need the government
to cooperate.
- Cooperate?
- Yes.
She is very good.
It's been 10 years that Uncle Sam takes
heavily on my pay
and now I owe him.
What have you done with my $ 200
last year?
I assure you
they were well spent.
By sending letters
the wrong people.
- I just check.
- Leave me alone.
I have a duty to perform.
It means nothing to you that
I spent three years up to the festival?
- Try it with a violin.
- Miss Jackson, you do not laugh.
Do you know what my title?
Wizard Wizard
Deputy Secretary of State.
I took 10 years to get that far.
If this fails,
I will return to square one.
Wizard Wizard
the assistant to the Deputy Secretary of State.
It is a real affair of state, tell me.
Miss Jackson
Have you ever been to Paris in the spring?
Are you kidding?
The prince and I'll always be
going to Monte Carlo.
No beautiful young lady
should miss this.
The cafes on the sidewalk,
champagne, songs.
- Who sings?
- In Paris, everybody sings.
All the time.
It's like that there.
This will soon be spring in Paris.
Children dancing
the Bois de Boulogne.
- Bolognaise?
- Boulogne.
Men will be selling hot chestnuts
with their little carts.
Chestnuts.
And everywhere, young couples hugging
to kiss.
Do not sacrifice this trip
because you hate me.
But I do not hate you.
You make so much effort
I'm starting to believe you.
If you come to use
your $ 200?
You may encounter a beautiful
young man and return to your cost.
You know what?
I might try it, yes.
I'll help you pack your bags.
- These bags are already made.
- What good is a waste of time!
When you're burning me too
I implore you, madam
hand me your lips
Do not whisper: "Let me time"
Keep your reasons
your rhymes for you
Give me your lips
Madam, somewhere, a ghost island
just waiting for our ghost ship
We will
giving me hope
You'll be mine
Give me everything that is most sublime
Give me your lips
Give me your lips
Madam, somewhere, a ghost island
just waiting for our ghost ship
We will
giving me hope
You'll be mine
Give me everything that is most sublime
Give me your lips
Philip!
She leaves a big tip.
Philip, you just calm down in the kitchen.
See you later, miss.
You think a good example
to other servers?
Yes, the question is,
can they go?
You should thank me
for this opportunity
Working to return to France.
Instead, you will not cause me
but trouble.
But I did not ask to be a waiter.
If I could talk to the commander,
I explained that
I could pay my travel in 1st class.
- Upon our arrival in France.
- The commander is ill.
He sees no one.
And I'm sure
he was not impressed
because you are Philippe Fouquet.
I seem to be the one to be.
If I still need to complain,
when will the captain standing
He will return to the United States,
where you will spend the rest of your life.
I beg you not when I eat.
Yesterday you made
breakfast in bed for a young lady
and you're there remained until after lunch.
Tomorrow, I'll go away.
You are so French.
Go take care of your table.
I promise not to tell the captain.
Mr. Leader, I love you.
If only you knew how to cook.
I'm sorry.
What was I thinking?
Miss Jackson
you use the teaspoon
instead of the spoon broth.
Try to remember:
The dessert spoon is a truncated ellipse.
Spoon broth, part of a sphere.
I will practice at night.
You did not think that I would?
Gentlemen, what have you ordered?
- The New England boiled dinner.
- With a poached egg.
Fortunately for you,
I am a man of taste.
I brought you to the place
coq au vin in Burgundy.
A chicken delicately flavored,
surrounded by nasty little fungus,
swimming naked in a pool of burgundy.
In Boston, you could use it
in public.
I should have kept Immigration
or grease for you that you're swimming.
Repeat this.
A spoonful of this rich food
surely kill me.
Better to die with it in the mouth
than live with a boiled dinner.
Amen.
Miss commissioned
The duckling flamed.
I will prepare before your eyes.
- That is good. This is my first time.
- Me too.
I'll bring my personal touch.
What a wonderful way
to drown a duck.
It does not bother you?
After all, this is our last evening.
Which reminds me,
your bags are ready?
I am so amused that
I could have stayed in the bag myself.
If everything is ready,
you do anything after dinner?
No. What were you thinking?
I think Mr. Stevens and Mr. Weimar
should help you
for your speech at the festival.
If you still flamed in cognac?
After that, Mr. Wilson spends time
with you
make the combination.
Irregular verbs,
that you pose so many problems.
- Then we could find.
- With joy.
To study the protocol.
You'll find it quite interesting.
Gentlemen, I have heard enough.
It has been four days since
I serve this table.
And nobody out
one word romantic
this lovely lady.
- It's against the rules, too?
- Waiter!
What has she done wrong?
From what I see from where I am,
it is an incredibly attractive young woman.
- Thank you, boy.
- Of course I could be wrong.
But I have at least half right.
Boy, so we'll look
our dessert.
Sir, your dessert is right here.
Tonight, there was a dance in the great hall.
I noticed as the young lady
you looked
when she takes the wrong spoon.
Believe me, sir.
If you take him to the ball tonight
you'll thank me
for the rest of your life.
Oh yeah?
This is outrageous.
I will report to the captain.
Not so fast.
There are 24 complaints before you.
It is right for one thing.
I'd love to go to the ball tonight.
It's out of question.
You have too much to do.
It's out of question.
You have too much to do.
Miss Jackson
I am no longer young
and I do not dance very well.
My feet are tired of having served
long hours of breakfast in bed.
But if you do me the honor
accompany me to the ball
I am a young man again.
It is the most beautiful invitation of my life.
If you want to shame the delegation
going to the prom with a server ...
- In this case, I can take.
- You will not do that.
And you, young lady,
finish your dinner.
Forget this nonsense
and reach your cabin.
Enough.
I did not ask to come
I was invited.
In fact, I was almost forced.
Sorry if I demeans the standing
This agreement pallbearers,
but I have enough to obey.
I shall not finish my dinner.
I will not in my room.
I do not know what I'll do.
Listen to my advice, hang well
your life jackets.
- Miss Jackson.
- Sit down, Winthrop.
Eat this duck, goose species.
I hope you like it cooked.
Waiter!
Do something.
Does it help?
It's wonderful, Philip.
- The whole trip should be like this.
- He's going to be patience.
In a few minutes, Mr. Putnam
will be enough to play chess.
He will pick you
I will tap on the shoulder ...
- You see?
- Philippe.
- Hello.
- Mademoiselle, I am very embarrassed
but do you know
that this man is a steward?
She is an angel.
- Fouquet has remade his own.
- If you allow ...
It is impossible.
We have been very lenient with you,
but you went too far.
Sorry, miss, you can stay
but not your joyous companion.
In this case, I still do not.
Come, my dear.
We will continue on another boat.
I'm sorry
you're put on your 31.
It was very nice of you
for inviting me tonight
but I returned to my cabin.
Would you like to live a life
boiled dinners
- And poached eggs?
- No.
And spend your evenings
to study programs?
No.
Do you prefer to rely entirely
the hands of a French
who has imagination, joy of living
and years and years of experience?
Lafayette, I'm here.
Cinderella has to go to the ball
albeit by the back door.
Unleash the room.
The ball will start.
Philip, are you crazy?
- Where have you been?
- There is work.
Yes, there is work.
This charming young lady
on the boat for four whole nights
and nothing has happened yet.
- Nothing.
- Impossible.
And on a French ship!
Do you know what that little
spent his evenings?
To conjugate verbs.
The honor of France is at stake
Can we let her in America
without a spouse?
No, gentlemen, never.
I pray you, sit down.
Even if the grand salon We are prohibited,
we have our ball here.
Well, my friends.
You are timid or the French?
French!
Sorry for the delay
your baking,
but the food was packed.
Let's drink to French cuisine.
- My stomach will never be the same.
- This is a unique evening.
All servers are dancing in the kitchen
even the head.
And your young lady danced
with each of them.
The true spirit of democracy.
And now, gentlemen, I leave you.
The next dance is for me.
Gentlemen, it was a noble experiment,
but it did not work.
We ran out of kindness.
Miss Jackson is young ...
- She should be told immediately ...
- And beautiful.
... we are bringing the United States.
Sir, I am not totally
agree with you,
but if you so desire,
I beg you not to be harsh with her.
I will not be hard.
For it is yours to do.
Very good, sir. I'll tell him.
But it may be that his reaction is violent.
Mr. Weimar, if I do not return,
finish the game
The representative of this great country
for which we have so much respect before ...
- What is it already?
- The United States.
Let's drink to the health of the United States.
Sorry, I never drink.
The man refuses to drink
the health of his country?
Which is the official?
- It'll make the one in Moscow.
- Sure.
Give me that.
I do not want the committee
investigating committees,
investigate me.
That's better.
United States.
And not for France?
It is very important to drink to France.
In France.
Miss Jackson, I promise you that in Paris
this will be the same every night.
I unlock my money
and you unlock me, me.
I do not want to stop now.
I prances.
For three nights in a row
It forced me to calm down
And say I did not like the role
Thanks to you, my friends
This little game is over
And you forgive me
If I lose a little control
I do not care what I did last night
And the night before
And the other night as before
I'll ring the bell tonight
I'll ring the bell tonight
That's what I'll do
I radiate joy and I feel
On  mood to party
That hangs  Commander
crew
It blew the plug tonight
It blew the plug tonight
That's what I'll do
And when the band
Will his five-minute break
You'll want
It  it resumes
your health, my health
a life full of joy
Me I oops-there-boom
The boat will pitch tonight
The boat will pitch tonight
's what we gonna do
When a violinist  danced his fiddle
It makes me want to jiggle my
But it could well be the bubbles
What makes this moaning saxophone
Go and find a ukulele
And you can do  ding-dong, ding-doung
your health, my
And a life full of joy
Let us therefore stick  trial
The boat will pitch tonight
The boat will pitch tonight
's what we gonna do
I'll ring the bell
Sauté  cap
And if the vessel sinks
be too bad for them
Because I "quoted"
Make  pitch
to rock the boat this evening
In Ethiopia!
In Afghanistan.
And if you think of other countries,
tell me.
The ball is now completed.
Cinderella returns to the heap of ashes.
I go home quietly.
You heard me.
As if I did not know what
you and your cartel have expected.
Send me the first plane
and hope he fails.
Go ahead.
Say I'm ashamed for my country.
Say something.
I have only one thing to say.
What?
What a beautiful plant.
Well.
It does not look like S. Winthrop Putnam.
Call me Sat
Mr. Putnam
should not be angry with Miss Jackson.
It's my fault. I made it come here.
I made him drink a little champagne.
I made it dance.
The medal will come later.
We dance?
You'd better go
take a poached egg.
Not worth the fight tonight
I'm lecturing.
I do not care
what you did last night
And the night before
And the other night as before
It rings the bell tonight
It rings the bell tonight
's what we gonna do
I did not know you danced
Department of State.
It depends what state you are.
You happen rather human.
I'll show you exactly
how I became one.
He
was, yes
Now it is continental
can do the same for you
It rings the bell tonight
It rings the bell tonight
That's what we're going  ...
Mr. Putnam.
Do not apologize
for having embraced.
Even if you are engaged.
- I understand.
- It does not upset you?
In this case,
Forgive me.
- Good night, Sam
- Good night.
Bad cabin.
Me too.
Forgive me.
- Good night, Sam
- Good night.
It must be wonderful to go to Vassar
and for the State Department for a father.
Not when we talk all the time.
My father was a janitor.
Building Equitable
at 48th Street and 8th Avenue.
I like janitors.
Me too. My father, anyway.
Without them, the Pentagon would be in
his memo to the knees.
- Good night.
- Good night.
It was not an ordinary janitor.
He was offered a watch. Any gold.
I have no doubt.
- Good night, Sam
- Good night.
You're going to marry?
- Her father is a very important man.
- That you will marry?
Neither one nor the other if I can prevent it.
But this I know.
Our engagement was announced
in the reports of Congress.
Well ...
- You're still the wrong cab.
- It's mine.
Sorry.
Wait.
It's yours.
I have a bigger water bottle.
Are you sure?
Listen.
There was a man on board
who can arrange this.
- Who?
- Commander.
Because he married people?
We can then spend the night
in your cabin
or mine,
or both.
It looks to me fair. Let's go.
Incidentally,
I love you very much,
Ethel.
Me too, Sam
First, the commander.
Miss, do you want
this man for a husband?
Yes, I want it.
And you, will you take
this woman in marriage?
Yes, I want it.
Not you. You are the witness.
Yes, I want it.
I now pronounce you husband and wife
by the power given to me
as commander of that ship.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
I think we'd better go ...
There is nothing else to do in the area.
Goodbye and thank you very much.
- Where are you?
- I am the witness.
Now you are no more.
Thank you for everything, Philip.
Go drink coffee black.
Thank you.
I know a place
A very special place
Where we only can go
one reaches its shores
because there was no shore
Neither  no house
Neither  no door at all
Yet the place is here
indeed the
The day you guess
The place and address
Will be the first day of happiness
Is it far?
Is almost
When we kiss
It differs very much
is the place
Whether you occupy in my heart
I've always considered that
stubborn as a fool,
tonight you proved that
you were a stubborn romantic fool.
I salute you.
- Francis.
- Sure.
Help me to open it.
But what does a busboy
in the captain's cabin?
He steals his liquor, why?
This is not logical.
A ship as large
with a commander-busboy?
Sober you up, Philip.
I am not the commander.
So why do you wear his jacket?
Because when you and your friends have come
knock at the door, I had to improvise.
Stop this blather.
There is more alcohol in the kitchen.
Francis, you married my American friends.
I'm sorry.
Tomorrow, I will divorce.
They returned to their cabin.
We must stop them.
They have helped many
with the Marshall Plan!
So I have to stop.
Say they are not married,
you imitated the commander.
Do you realize the seriousness
of this crime on the high seas?
We'll lock me up.
You'll be returned to the United States.
So what can we do?
Separates them while they are on the ship.
Once they are ashore,
you can tell them,
because the commander must never learn
what happened tonight.
What do I never learn?
What are you doing in my cabin?
It just steals your spirit, that's all.
I'm sick days
and the whole ship goes mad.
We dance in the kitchen,
you steal my champagne.
You're Fired both.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much and good night.
- Where are you going so fast?
- In the kitchen.
- There was something on fire.
- Sit down, Mr. Fouquet.
You too.
I wish I had a long discussion
with you.
You could summarize
for Reader's Digest
Sure.
Toothbrush.
I always read before going to sleep.
You look for a cab, I on the other.
I hate myself already.
With the compliments of the chef,
your wedding breakfast.
Breakfast?
It's the middle of the night.
In fact, the night has barely begun.
- Good.
- Philip, you're drunk.
I assure you I could not do
I'll do if I was sober.
Philip.
I have heard of breakfast in bed
but this is ridiculous.
Forgive me.
- I will clean it immediately.
- No.
Excuse me.
I will not for awhile.
So tell you.
What?
Listen ...
I'm too busy this booth.
It gives a bad reputation
this boat.
You're gonna love my parents.
Really?
Dad is a professor
at the Institute of Technology Massa ...
chusetts.
No wonder you're so smart.
Enough to marry you
before you can say no.
Somewhere
I am not really married.
Me either.
I guess you do not feel
the second year.
Earlier than that.
Ms. S. Winthrop Putnam.
Ms. Sam Putnam.
Forgive me, darling.
Toothbrush.
I'm so sleepy.
Sam, what has happened?
Is everything okay?
Who is it?
Surely your drunkard friend Philippe
with breakfast.
He must think
it's a fun racket.
Go!
Take an anchor
and jump overboard.
What's there, young man?
One minute.
This is Sherman.
What do we do?
Tell him we're married.
We can perhaps use his cabin.
- You can not do that.
- Why not?
I'm going to tell him gently.
After all, I'm going to marry his daughter ...
Really?
You'd better go there.
What a place for a honeymoon.
Well, young man.
I hope you are happy with you,
tonight.
I can not say I am.
I have nothing against a little wine
but this scene in the kitchen,
it was a bit too much.
- Close the door.
- I will do my best.
- I had a nightmare.
- Really?
Indian.
You do not seem to grasp
the seriousness of the situation.
I have something very important
I want to talk about.
Winthrop, you must understand
that the American people ...
expects its staff
be appointed by him,
but do not act like him.
And do the wedding with dancers
is no way
to influence voters.
If I hear more gossip
you and Miss Jackson
I do not want my daughter
to postpone his marriage with you.
It would be right.
And also you will destroy your career.
I would have no choice
that you refer.
Let me read a few paragraphs
the manual driving
Department of State.
Trapped.
- I'm sorry.
- I do not care for your courtesies.
- Get me out of there.
- It was an accident.
All this is a nightmare.
- I'll dust.
- I've had enough.
This has already been used.
Regardless, just listen to me.
"Section B, paragraph 32:
All employees of this department
must maintain the dignity and decorum
expected of employees
Department of State. "
It is repeated
that any misconduct
will reflect unfavorably
the United States government.
Yes, sir.
Who lit the fire extinguishers?
Sam!
Read on,
the evening is damn anyway.
Hello, darling.
And do not say that the world is small.
Marcia.
You remember my name.
- Hello, Dad.
- How did you get so far?
My pocket money was so
accumulated I took a plane.
I'm grown up now.
We stay here or you remain standing there
play in the post?
- Is this our little dancer?
- Not yours, dear.
Marcia, I would like to introduce you
Mrs, Miss. ..
Dynamite Jackson.
Here they are.
Now they are down,
I must say
they are not married.
You become a boiled dinner.
They ride in their car.
- They go through customs?
- They have diplomatic immunity.
Yes, but not all.
OPENING TODAY
I tell him just after the festival.
And meanwhile,
I sleep in bathtubs?
This meeting is important.
I will not be returned before.
If you touch Miss Vassar 1922
Again, I beat you.
Goodnight, Sam
- Everybody kiss you, except your wife.
- After all, France.
Who had the idea to bring that Jackson?
We shall return soon
Winthrop but thought
him to make an appearance,
as a democratic gesture.
His movements are increasingly
each day.
Calm down.
Respect for the thousands of dollars
spent to make you a lady.
Lady or not, if Miss Cabaret continues
whisper in his ear, I freak.
I am pleased to present
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
United States of America.
Is not that wonderful, darling?
Ladies and gentlemen
delegates
International Arts Festival.
It is a privilege to speak
at a meeting
whose sole purpose is to promulgate
peace, friendship and harmony.
You know why I followed you?
I think we should get married
immediately.
There will be the world in the bathtub.
Put on your helmets,
you hear better.
I do not need it, honey.
My mind is wide.
And in this case, I use the term
deliberately.
Here, unanimity of thought is complete.
Here do not rule but harmony, friendship and peace.
Before continuing, Mr. Putnam should you
tell what happened on the boat.
You should listen.
We enter the story.
I guess.
I was told that in New York
you had a specialty.
I try to be nice, my dear,
so do not provoke me.
I do not want
what I might be ashamed.
You mean the day, of course.
We all
one big happy family,
whose words are peace,
Friendship
and harmony.
I beg you, Miss Sherman.
Do not do that, please. Attention.
- No!
- Ladies ...
Marcia!
- Stop immediately!
- Miss Sherman.
Ms. Jackson, do not!
Winthrop, can you stop it!
Mr. Wilson, do something ...
Standing. Stop. Listen.
- It has begun.
- Marcia, behave yourself.
There.
Ladies, you realize
it is the international festival.
I think you proved demonstration
the need to refer
Ms Jackson in the United States.
- The sooner the better.
- You think you're clever.
Your baby has something
to tell you.
Ethel, I mean, Miss Jackson
it will take weeks
to restore harmony here.
I do not want to do anything
that the more disruptive.
Not now.
You measure the importance
it has for me.
I start, yes.
Give me some time
to arrange ...
- Ethel, wait ...
- Let her go.
Miss Jackson?
Welcome to the gay Paris.
So I'm not even married
this big beta.
I would have told you earlier,
but I did not before arrival.
Sam knows?
I left him a message to the hotel.
Married and divorced by servers.
This is a great career.
My little Camille, do not be so tragic.
Tragic? Me?
I'm brimming with joy to rid myself
this pretentious.
In fact, I celebrate the news.
Boy?
Another drink.
Thank you.
Why not go inside?
Because it is April in Paris.
When it's April in Paris
we sit all out.
Can I leave the bottle?
You come back?
In July.
I'll tell you:
Sat Putnam means nothing to me.
I came to Paris for fun
and that's what I'll do.
Do not be sarcastic.
Philippe, sing something.
Sing? I do not want to.
But in Paris
everybody wants to sing.
What a horrible idea.
Come, Philip,
be gay and careless.
And Champs Elysees.
Okay, I'll try.
April in Paris
chestnut flowers
output tables under the trees
April in Paris
It feels
What nobody could reproduce
I never knew
The charm of spring
'd never hit so close
I never knew
That my heart could sing
No warm embrace
had never missed
Until April in Paris
to turn to?
What did you make me
heart
Useless, Philip.
Like the man I married
and who is not even my husband.
Even in Paris, this is unusual.
What will I do?
I can crawl back to him.
Sure he will not return
crawling towards me.
You will not leave Paris without him.
I promise you.
With what I have up there
and what you have there,
we find a way.
Good night, darling.
You're not ready?
You better
to go to the tavern without me.
I have a headache.
But it's the best show in Paris.
We have a table first.
There is apparently a new
great American artist.
What's going on?
I do not want
you catch my migraine.
I will not go if you feel well.
Lay down that I will ground the temples.
- I can get up to take an aspirin.
- But this is not the same thing.
- Get out. I feel better.
- While there is no reason to leave.
I will be ready in a gale.
Ethel.
- I'm distributed in New York.
- They had to refuse.
So keep the Empire State
Who is great
But that's all
Take  therefore, your old New York
I'm also going
Me, I want Paris
My New York may have its faults
As you say
But your  Paris has also
Please, over here
From your hotel
The view is beautiful
But the problem in the story
There is no bathtub
The plumbing  date of 1883
I know
But therein lies the charm of Paris
The clothes are chic
hats, unique
What rapture
Then comes the note
And you end up penniless
Therein lies the charm of Paris
Cart Dealer
The Eiffel Tower
flower market
The Eiffel Tower
Art priceless
The Eiffel Tower
The Eiffel Tower
The awful Eiffel Tower
We do not support
Not without love
I like love
But not always
I think it's heredity
As they say ...
Therein lies the charm of Paris
But New York is my home
boy regrets
No  crepes Suzette?
Ms.  pale
Snails
stomach, yes, you'll see
But therein lies the charm of Paris
Try
To have a taxi
He put his light
It goes like  air
And you happily reverses
Therein lies the charm of Paris
Happy cafés
The Eiffel Tower
mayo
The Eiffel Tower
The Eiffel Tower
if tiring
If  inspiring Eiffel Tower
Me, I saw everything
ball of Fine Arts
Rue de la Paix
It can go
Force me a little and it will
Paris begins to please me
Art priceless
Cart Dealer
chic clothing
leaky pipes
Therein lies the charm
Therein lies the charm
Therein lies the charm
De Paris
It was quite a spectacle
for at least one person.
I wonder what he has
between it and the French.
I gotta go find out.
No. You're going back to the hotel and forget it.
I can not forget.
Whenever I try,
I remember very clearly.
It might be easier
to forget.
Winthrop.
If you leave me,
it's the end of your career.
You will not be even
dog catcher.
It suits me perfectly.
I've picked up too.
You never loved me.
You wanted to marry me
to redo the White House.
- Winthrop.
- I will tell Ethel that I love.
- Dad, why did not you say?
- What could I say?
He pretty much covered it.
It's yours.
I heard him gasp from the scene.
- You think he'll come back?
- Crawling.
Like a poodle.
He scratches at the door.
I do not want to see.
But he came back.
You love him, he loves you.
What's more?
He has not suffered enough, that's all.
Enter.
Ethel, I love you.
He loves you.
- Shut up, thief of women.
- Bravo. He is also jealous.
- Would you hit me? I'm despicable.
- After.
You're not my wife,
but I want you to be.
Mr. Putnam
I never trust to a promise
made on a whim.
- It would break your career is already over.
- I do not want.
- Shall we?
- Where?
Where we go every night.
He is embarrassed in front of men
honorable intentions.
We'll do the wedding.
- One minute.
- We'll dance until dawn.
And laugh, sing
drink champagne and endless.
Mr. Putnam then inform
State Department
that tonight I will have for my 200 dollars.
What do you want from me?
Sam is income to you.
You just need to pick
like a ripe peach.
It is not mature enough. He must suffer.
Ethel.
Suffer.
Hurry. Do not lose eye
this taxi. The girl I married is.
Fouquet has remade his own.
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Philip.
Bring the young lady to his hotel
at 94, rue Fauberge.
Thank you.
Guess who.
Si
Tuck, it's late.
The game is over.
Almost. He followed us.
- He saw you come in?
- That's what I wanted.
There are crazy in your family?
- No.
- Now, if.
They do not believe.
Me, Philippe Fouquet
I fight for my honor.
Sat
Destroyer of homes.
In America, you hang him for that.
It was self-defense.
- Species of gigolo.
- Sat
You really want me.
And you go back to the hotel with me.
Get up I knock you down again.
Explain to us ...
I stay on the floor as she does.
Philip. What happened?
What's the matter?
- What did they do?
- Nothing.
Who are you?
Miss Jackson, my wife, Madame Fouquet.
Married too.
In America, you wring the neck
after you have hung.
Why?
For trying to bring
an idiot to her man?
To have it thrown out of my house?
Almost every night
a fool follows him home.
It has become monotonous.
But nobody told me his wife.
In the eyes of all,
I'm his housekeeper.
Everyone should know in France
Philippe Fouquet
an old married man with five children.
- Five children.
- I am a very good housekeeper.
If it is known, it would be bad
for my business.
- And how he would feed his family?
- That's what I want to know.
Philippe Fouquet must play
the gay fellow, dancing, singing.
A different woman every night.
And I always come home to my wife.
Tired, but he returned.
Merry Paris.
I will not believe anything about Paris
my whole life.
I do not believe this.
You can fool S. Winthrop Putnam
not Sat
I am a new man.
You'll wake the children.
If anything, I eat them all.
- On toast.
- Papa!
Or white bread?
Here's my good American friends,
miss Mr. Jackson and Putnam
who do not believe you exist.
Enough. Go to bed.
- Charles, Yvonne.
- She is right. I accompany you.
This is my career.
Good night.
So?
All this proves that you flirts
with a married man.
It proves nothing of the sort.
How could I know?
It is a state secret.
Then you cook something up
with a man who was not.
- I did not know his children.
- If it were 5 women do not matter.
I pray you, go home.
Kiss you, marry you,
do something you go to bed.
I married once is enough.
How to convince
poached egg that I like?
- Love is for peasants.
- So I am one.
Philippe, love is not it wonderful?
It is I who am asking you.
Love?
Love is beautiful, I tell you.
Ask anyone in Paris
He will tell you yes
Not for me
It's so nice
I hate
For boys and girls
Overrated
Love is happiness
pure idiocy
is you, the idiot
Stop being an idiot and kiss me
She's right, stubborn
Stay out of it
It's my fault, not hers
is fine
Can I go?
If I can monitor
It's so sad
is scary
She is adorable
He is contemptuous
they arrange it for themselves
Philip?
Goodbye, my friends
I have problems on my side
You've
is wrong
is you who I am
Who  follows that
Let us all
embrace us and we say farewell
Farewell forever
Please
Love is not it wonderful?
I ask
Is not it wonderful?
I ask
I do not know
That my heart could sing
No warm embrace
had never missed
Is not it beautiful?
What a beautiful plant.
