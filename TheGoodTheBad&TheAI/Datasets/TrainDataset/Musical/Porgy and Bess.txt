Summertime

Oh your daddy's rich

So hush, little baby,

One of these mornin's

Then you'll spread yo' wings

But till that mornin'

With Daddy and Mammy standin' by.

Oh, nobody knows when

So..  roll dem bones,

If they rolls in this game,

Honey boy!

Honey, don't play tonight.
Do like I say.

Night time is man's time.
He got a right to forget his troubles.
He got a right to play.
If you hadn't been drinkin'
you wouldn't talk to me that way.
You ain't nebber hear
Lord Jesus say nuttin'
'bout got to play.
There you go again.
Lissen what I say.
I works all the week;
Sunday got to pray.
But Saturday night
a man's got a right to play.
Yes, sir, that's right.
That ole lady of mine is hell on
savin' money to join
the buryin' lodge.
I says spend it while
you is still alive and kickin'.
Lord, I is tired this night.
I'm done with cotton.
Better come along with me
on the Sea Gull.
I got room for another fisherman.
That suit me.
This cotton hook done swing

Here, who wants a cotton hook?
Summertime and the livin' is easy...
Seven come,

Throw that beautiful number!
Come seven to me! Yeah, man!

Gettin' hot!

Lissen to yo' daddy warn you,
'Fore you start a-travelling,
Woman may born you,
love you and mourn you,
But...
a woman is a sometime thing,
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.
Oh, a woman is a sometime thing.
Yo' mammy is the first to name you,
Then she'll tie you
to her apron string,
Then she'll shame you
and she'll blame you
Till yo' woman comes to claim you,
'Cause
a woman is a sometime thing,
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.
Oh, a woman is a sometime thing.
Don't you never let
a woman grieve you
Jus' cause she got
yo' weddin' ring.
She'll love you
and deceive you,
Take yo' clothes
and leave you
'Cause
a woman is a sometime thing.
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.
There now, what I tells you;

He got better sense

Come back, Jake,

Yes man, I got honey in de comb.

Now we'll have a game!

what got the guts to shoot it off me.
Get on down, son we'll take it.
Lay it down.
All right, mens, roll 'em.
We done wait long enough.
You bes' wait for Crown.
I see him comin',
takin' the whole sidewalk,
And he looks like
he ain't gonna stand no foolin'.
Is Bess with him?
Lissen to Porgy.
I think he's sof'
on Crown's Bess.
I ain't nebber swap
two words with Bess.
Porgy got too good sense
to look twice at that
liquor guzzlin' slut.
That gal Bess ain't fit
for Gawd fearin'
ladies to 'sociate with.
Can't you keep
yo' mouth off Bess.
Between Gawd fearin' ladies
and the Gawd damnin' men
that gal ain't got a chance.
Ain' I tells you Porgy sof' on her?
No, no, brudder,
Porgy ain't sof' on no woman;
They pass by singin',
they pass by cryin',
always lookin'.
They look in my do'
an' they keep on movin'.
When Gawd make cripple,
He mean him to be lonely.
Night time, day time,
He got to trabble
dat lonesome road.
Night time, day time,
He got to trabble
dat lonesome road.
Here comes Big Boy!
'Low, Crown.
'Low, Bess.
Hi, boys!
All right, Sporting Life,
give us a pint
and make it damn quick.
Pay him, Bess.
Drunk again!
He sure love his liquor,
but some day
she's gonna throw him down.
That damn liquor'
jus' as weak as water.
See that hussy drinkin' like any man!
have one to the
Gawd fearin' ladies.
There's nothin' like 'em,
thank Gawd.
Oh, no, you don't.
Nobody ain't drinkin'
none of my licker
All right, mens,
I'm talkin' to you.
Anybody answerin' me?
Boxcars again.
Cover 'em, brother,
cover 'em.
I goin' to pass 'em along and see
if I can break my luck.
Robbins' lady ain't allow him
but fifty cent
and he can't take
no chances with bad luck.
That's all right, honey boy,
I'll stake you when
yo' four bits done gone.
Go ahead an' play.
You don't need no charity
off no she-devils.
See what I gets for you.
Yo' woman is easy
when you know the way.
Crapped out!
Don't you ever
let a woman grieve you
Cause she got yo' wedding ring.
She'll love you and deceive you,
take yo' clothes and leave you
'Cause...
A woman is a sometime thing.
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.
That gal ain't need to worry
'bout no man marryin' her.
Some women got to marry
a man to keep him.
Shut yo' damn mouth!
You don't give Mingo a chance
to talk to the bones.
Fade me.
Old snake-eye go off an' die.
Old man seven

Crapped out,

Crown too cock-eyed drunk

What the dice say, Bess?
Seven.
I ain't drunk enough
to read 'em.
That is the trouble.
Licker ain't strong enough.
Give me a pinch of happy dust,
Sportin' Life.
Don't give him that stuff,
Sportin' Life.
He's ugly drunk already.
Pay him an' shut up.
Frien' an' dice an' happy dust

You mens bes' go slow.
Leave Peter be, let him alone.
He ain't mean no harm.
Huh, seven!

Roll up that bastard's sleeve.
Well, you got them damn dice,

Nine spot!

Touch that money an' meet yo' Gawd!
Take yo' hand off me, you lousy houn'.
Han' me that brick behin' you.
Nobody's gettin' away

I'm goin' kill dat bastard!
Looks like trouble to me;
He made his nine,
There's gonna be a fight,
look out!
Somebody hold them back,
Crown got murder in his eye!
Somebody hold them back!
Oh, stop them,
someone will get hurt!
Why must people fight?
Crown is a bad, bad bizness
when he's drunk!
Why mus' they fight
Can't anybody make Crown stop,
Lawd, please make dem stop!
Jesus, he killed him!
Wake up an' hit it out.
You ain't got no time to lose.
What the matter?
You done kill Robbins
and the police will be comin'.
Where you goin' hide?
They know you an'
I pulls together.
Some man always willin'

Well, get this:

All right, only get out now.
Here, take this.

Why you an' me will

I ain't come to that yet.
Well, the cops ain't goin' find me

You done bring trouble enough,

You wouldn't have a heart

Not till hell freeze!
Who live over there?
That's Porgy,

Where is brudder Robbins?
He's a-gone, gone, gone,

But he's gone, gone, gone,

But death acome awalkin'

An' he's gone, gone, gone,

An' he's gone, gone, gone,

Overflow, overflow.

Thank you, Lawd,
Bless you Lawd.
Lawd will fill de saucer,
Um! A saucer-burial setup,
I see. You're his widow?
Yes, suh.
He did not leave
any burial insurance?
No, boss,
he didn't leave nuttin'.
Well, see to it he's buried tomorrow.
You killed Robbins an' I'm going
to hang you for it!
He ain't don um!
What he say?
He say you kill Robbins.
Come along now!
'Fore Gawd, boss,
I ain't never done um!
Who did it, then?
You heard me, who did it?
Crown done it, boss.
I done see him do it.
You're sure you saw him?
I swear to Gawd, boss,
I was right there beside him.
That was easy.
I thought as much.
You. You saw it too.
I don't want to have
to put the law on you.
Look at me,
you damn dummy!
I don't know nuttin'
'bout it, boss.
That's your room in the corner,
ain't it?
Yes, boss, dat's my room.
The door opens on the court,
don't it?
Yes, boss, my door opens
on the court.
An' yet you didn't see
or hear anything?
I don't know nuttin'
'bout it, boss.
I been asleep inside,
and my door been closed.
You're a damn liar.
He saw the killing;
take him along and lock him up
as a material witness.
Come along, uncle.
I ain't done it, boss.
How long you goin' lock him up for?
Till we catch Crown.
I reckon Crown done loose now
in de palmetto thickets,
an' dere ain' no rope
long enough to hang him.
Then the old man's out of luck.
Remember,
you've got to bury
that body tomorrow
or the board of health
will take him
an' turn him over
to the medical students.
Come on,
get the old man in the wagon.
I ain't never done nuttin', boss.
I swear to Gawd
I ain' never done nuttin'.
I can't puzzle this thing out.
Peter was a good man,
but dat lousy Crown was a killer
and forever gettin' into trouble.
That's the truth, brother.
And there go Peter
to be lock up like a thief.
Like a thief.
An' here be Robbins
with his wife
and his fadderless chillen,
an' Crown done gone his ways
drinkin', gamblin', swearin',
to do the same thing
over and over somewheres else.
Gone, gone, gone,
gone, gone, gone.
My man's gone now,
Ain't no use alistenin'
For his tired foot-steps
Climbin' up de stairs. Ah!

Come to keep me comp'ny,
Whisperin' beside me
When I say my prayers.

To de promise land.
But Ole Man Sorrow's
Marchin' all de way wid me
Tellin' me I'm ole now

Since I lose my man.

Since my man is dead!
How de saucer stan' now,

There ain't but fifteen dollar.
Hum! Can't bury him
for fifteen dollar.
He got to be buried tomorrow
or the board of health will

to the medical students.
Life is hard, brudder,
but we all got to live.

to bury a grown man.
Oh, for Gawd sake,

Don't let the students take him

If I get my hands on you once more,
you'll see quick enough.
All right,

but remember ole Sportin' Life
an' de happy dus' here all along.

to de picnic, Bess.
Bess, you is my woman now,

Because de sorrow of de past
