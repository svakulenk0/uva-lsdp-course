Where you gonna be
Ten years from now,
where do I wanna be?
I wanna be...just living, man. Just living
comfortably with my wife, you know.
Just layin'back. Just chilling.
You know what I'm saying? Living.
Where do I thi nk I'll be
in 10 years?
I don't think I'll be seeing it, dog, for real,
man. I don't think my luck is that good.
-
- I hope it is, but if it ain't, so be it. I'm ready.

I don't know.
What's up with you?.
-
-  In the beginning...
God gave me a clean slate.
-
-
But where I grew up,
I knew I couldn't stay clean.
Ifyou was a nice, ordinary kid...
you was an easy mark for the wannabe gangsters
and cutthroat girls in the schoolyard.
- You wanna check out this magazine?.
- Right on. Let's go.
Fab 5 Freddy. There we go.
Kurtis Blow, man!
He's the man! You know--
# Clap your hands, everybody

# Break it up, break it up

- There we go.
- Yeah.
I know.
Y'all want our autograph?.
We gonna be in a magazine one day.
Chris Shy-ass
can't be in no magazine.
He's too fat, black and ugly.
At least there ain't
no train tracks in my mouth.
What do I tellyou?
Ifyoujustpayattention...
you study hard, always do your best
and lookwhat happens.
A hundred percent!
- I'm proud ofyou, Chrissy-poo.
- Don't call me that!
Oh, I forgot.
You're all grown-up now, huh?.
Mymoms was from
a small town inJamaica...
where theyleft
the doors unlocked at night.
But in our neighborhood, the only time
she let me offthe stoop...
was when she walked me
home from school.
We've seen that 1 2, 1 3 times.
Don'tyou wanna see something different?
This was Brooklyn. Do-or-die Bed-Stuy.
- And there was just some shit
Moms couldn't protect me from.
-
Voletta.
Christopher, say hello to your father.
You are still beautiful,
Voletta.
If that's what you came for
you can leave right now.
Sugar?.
A hundred dollars.
Is that all he's worth toyou?
Are you even planning on
being in his life?.
- Things are complicated.
- Things?.
I feel like
ifyou and I could just--
It was easy to lie
about yourwife.
Now, when it comes toyour child,
""things"are complicated.
Bye, Voletta.
Hey!
You forgot something.
You're a real piece ofshit.

##
-
-  What's up, y'all?.
This is Super Rocking
Mr. Magic holding it down.
-  This is DJ Marley Marl.
- Check it out, y'all.
It's all the waylive.
##
It's time for bed, mister.
He ain't coming back, is he?.
No. I don't believe so.
Good. I'm glad.
Oh.
Come here.
-
-
We're gonna be all right,
justyou and me.
- ##
- #You ain't no pops to me #
#You just some nigga
sipping on tea #
# Moms don'twantyour money
so run and flee #
Flee--
# Back all hunched over
'causeyou gotta admit #
# I don't need you in my life
'causeyou ain't shit ##
- ##
-
# Hey, ho
Hey, ho #
Right then and there...
I decided to stop being
that little kid on the stoop.
# Hey, ho
Hey, ho #
I wanted to be like
them brothers on the block.
They didn't hold
their heads down for no one.
# Hey, ho
Hey, ho #
I knew life
was a fucked-up game...
and I knew D Roc was fucked up enough
to show me how to play.
- What's up, D Roc?.
- What up, big boy?.
- Your mama finally let you out the house?.
- Told you I would come.
- I ain't on lockdown like that.
- So you ready to be a big baller?.
What I gotta do?.
- ##
- ##
Remember, just act like
you slapping the nigga five.
# Five, six
One, one, two, two, three #
# Four, four, five, six
One, two, three, four, five #
- The phone is ringing.
-
Motherfuckers got
addicted to crack after they first hit...
but I got addicted to money
after my first sale.
By the time I was 1 7,,
I wasn't no ordinary kid. I was paid.
Christopher, you're not still
lying in that bed, are you?
No.
-
- Christopher, what are you doing?
- ##
- You sayingyourprayers?
Prayi ng that God teaches you how to knock.
Please. Don't you mock your prayers.
You don't thinkJehovah
has a sense ofhumor?
He must have, if he made you.
We always gotta listen
to this corny old country music?.
I happen to like this music.
They tell good stories.
So, who wereyou yappin'
on the phone with last night?.
-Jan.
-
It's perfectly normal
for a mother to feel jealous...
when her son cares about another female.
Oh, for crying out loud!
By the way, Ma--
- What?.
- How much does a garbage collector make?.
I think about 28,000 a year. Why?.
- No reason.
- Would you hurry up beforeyou
make us both late for class?.
-  Hey, Voletta.
Is that the new Watchtower?.
- Of course.
We gonna see you this weekend, right?.

Me and D Roc were like factoryworkers...
and Fulton Street
was the assemblyline.
# Here we go #
But every now and then,
D Roc would say, ""Yo, can I get a rhyme?"
-
- See, drug dealing was like my wife.
Rapping was just some chick on the side.
Before I knew it, word got out
about my skills and shit.
Then this kid named Primo
called me out.
Everyone was jocking him,
'cause he never lost a battle.
It was one thing to rhyme foryour boys,
but it was another to battle.
- ' Bout ti me you stopped runni ng.
- ' Bout time your ass stopped talking shit.
-  Yeah. That's Chris.
- Come on, man.

Hey, deejay, play me something nice, man.

I 'm gonna get some barbecue chicken
when I'm done with big boy.
You sure you don't want
no barbecue chicken?.

Get him downtown.
Primo. Who the hell is that?
-
-  Word!
What's up, Mom Dukes?.
So I was by Fulton Records and I thought,
""What would make Slim happy??"'
So I bought you the corniest
country album I could find.
In the last month,
you have missed 20 days of school.
All right. Look.
I tried, Ma.
I missed a few days.
But I went back three weeks straight.
Then three people came to
my class on career day:.
a computer technician,
a store owner, a doctor...
- and they all looked like poor, broke-down niggas.
- You watch your mouth.
I can't see myself going to
school to end up like them...
'cause I got something to do right now.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?.
Jan's pregnant.
I'm gonna be a father.
Please tell me thatyou are not that stupid.
Whywould you even say
something like that?.
Becauseyou are still a damn boy.
Is this whyyou think
I came to the States--
So I can spend all my days
taking care ofyou, feeding you?.
Cleaning up old plates of mashed potatoes
you leave underyour bed?.
- What?.
- You can't take care ofyourself.
- How areyou gonna take care of a baby?.
- What didyou do with it?
- Where's the plate?.
- I threw it in the trash. It was disgusting.
It's mywork, man.
- What are you doing?.
- Those wasn't no damn mashed potatoes, all right?.
Look at me.
I said, ""Look at me."
Areyou telling me
what I thinkyou're telling me?.
Boy, you gonna end up like those
worthless bums you hang with.
- Don'tyou see that?.
- Bums don't have chains, and boys
don't have money. I'm a man.
You think that makes you a man?.
Get out.
- Ma.
- Get out.

I had fouryoung cats out on the streets.
Look atyou, man.
All grown up and shit.
Shut the fuck up and get back by the door.
I wasn't hanging with
my boys, wasn't messing with no chicks.
I was too busy counting paper.
- But I was moving too fucking fast and I slipped up.
-
-
-
-
You have a collect call from--
-
Christopher Wallace.
...an inmate at the Wake CountyJail.
-
- Ma.
Damn you, Christopher.
I fucked up.
I need your help.
No. You gotyourselfinto this mess.
You getyourself out.
I can't askyou to pray for me?.
I never stop praying foryou.
Butyou need to stop wasting God's time
and pray foryourself.
So it's like that?.
It is like that.
- Closeyour eyes, Christopher.
-
Yea, though I walk through
the valley ofthe shadow of death--
Yea, though I walk through
the valley ofthe shadow of death--
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.
Thoupreparest a table before me
in the presence ofmine enemies.
-
-  My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy
will follow me all the days ofmy life.
You gotyourself
into this mess. You getyourselfout.
That was the first time
in my life I thought ifl was dead...
my fucking problems
would go away.
I started rhyming 'cause I was bored.
Plain and simple.
But then my frustrations turned into rhymes,
and those rhymes told my story.
- # The 23 rd Psal m was what
my moms had to offer #
-
# No collection plate
to make hard time feel softer #
# I know how it feels
to wake up fucked up #
# Pockets broke as hell
Another rock to sell #
# I got P-A -I-D
That's why my moms hates me #
# She was forced
to kick me out, no doubt #
# Then I figured out nicks
went for 20 down south #
Christopher, it's a girl.
# I know how it feels
to wake up fucked up #
# Pockets broke as hell
Another rock to sell #
##
# Baby on the way
Mad bills to pay ##
Welcome home.

My surgery is next week. They need to act
aggressively if I'm gonna have a chance.
""If'?.
