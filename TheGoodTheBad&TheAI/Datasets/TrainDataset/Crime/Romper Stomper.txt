- What did you run into me for?
- I didn't mean to, that guy pushed me.
What are you doing here?
I'm going to tell you something.
I want you to listen to me, OK?
This is not your country.
Help!
Get the yellow fuck!
Fuck off!
Fucking squinty! Fuck him!
Fuck him!
One, two...
Get him!
You like it, gooky boy?
Fuck off!
Hurry, your brother needs the pot.
- What happened?
- Fucking skinheads!
They bashed Long, Vinh and my sister.
Look, my sister's blood.
Come on. We'll get some payback.
All the guys from the factory are with us.
But we're going to need more wheels,
so bring your car.
The skinheads would all be gone by now.
We'll find them, sooner or later.
Well? My sister worked for you
and your father. Remember?
Doesn't that mean anything?
Dad will kill us
if he knows we left the car.
He's right.
Yeah? Yeah?
Forget them, Tiger.
Chicken shit.
I'll help. Can I come?
Forget it, shrimp.
Where is he? Inside?
Yeah, he hasn't come out
but he's expecting you.
That was Pommy Bill.
He's come to help.
- He hurt you?
- No.
But he's been hitting the rohys again.
It's the worst I've ever seen him.
Are you all right?
Perhaps if you stop struggling, Sir...
Have it your way.
Do you like punching up little girls, Sir?
Do junkies like punching up little girls?
- Have you been taking the Phenytoin?
- Yeah.
Then where is it?
I don't know. I'm busy.
You haven't, have you?
- Seizures been bad?
- No.
You've got a bloody chemist shop here.
You'll fry your brains with this stuff.
And the one drug you really need,
you don't bother with.
I need some money, Martin.
Come on now.
Shut up!
It's your game anyway,
you stupid...
Get away from me, you bastard!
I'll fucking kill you!
Missed you badly.
I don't want that.
Can't you just be nice to me?
Pick up your things
and let's get out of here.
Get away from me, you bastard!
I'm going to fucking kill you!
I can't stay with you,
Martin, come on.
Fuck off!
You're the one who always starts it.
- All right!
- Hey, boys!
Tracy!
Sorry.
The men are here.
The big men have arrived.
Come here, you!
Piss off!
Fuck off!
Hey, we need your muscle.
Rob and Chris have kicked us out the squat.
Three jugs, Harold.
- Fucking Rob hit me too.
- Are you going to stomp 'em for us, Davey?
Hey! Get him out!
Come on. I'm not serving
any bloody kids. Get him out!
If he doesn't leave,
I turn off the beer.
Now!
OK, Bubs, piss off.
Come on, out you go!
Get your mother to read you a story.
Piss off, Bubs!
Go home!
Hey, Rollo says you had
some gooks in here last week.
- What's it to you?
- What were they doing here?
- This is our place, mate.
- No, this is my fucking place, mate!
Yeah, but you had gooks here.
Doesn't bother me.
You got a problem with that,
that's your fucking problem.
- Who's that?
- I don't know.
Never seen her before.
- Bit of a space monster, if you ask me.
- You mean space cadet.
Hey, mate,
you gonna give us a drink?
Come on, mate.
Come on, give us a drink.
Fuck!
Your breath smells like shit.
- Hey, can we go?
- What did you just call me?
Hey, what did you just call me?
- Just leave it. Let's just go.
- Don't lean on my face!
Davey!
Get off me!
- Do you surrender?
- Yeah, fucking whatever, I surrender.
Motherfucker!
You're getting better, Davey.
Gee, look at that jacket.
It's beautiful!
You want that jacket?
Move!
- Nice jacket.
- Yeah.
Well, I hope it was worth it.
It's bleeding.
It's not even deep.
Got a bit of glass in it, though.
Do you want me to operate?
It's still bleeding.
This is pretty clean.
This is home.
- Yeah, what is this, a squat?
- Squat be fucked! We pay rent for this.
Let me show you this.
What is this?
Do you love me?
So you're awake.
Brought my bag up from downstairs.
I didn't get to salvage much
from the place where I was living.
Some idiot tore it all up.
These are for tap dancing. See?
But they don't fit me anymore.
That's a picture of my mum.
Isn't she beautiful?
Everyone says I look like her.
Not saying I'm good-looking.
I'm not saying that.
But we do look alike.
She's dead now.
It was a car accident.
She had her head chopped off.
I think it's good to be able to talk about
these things without cracking up, you know?
Besides...
I know she's still with me somehow.
I think, that when I have kids,
she'll be one of them.
You know, sort of reincarnated.
What are you doing?
Why don't you fucking keep your mind
on the fucking job, woman?
What?
Hando, Magoo.
- Magoo!
- Way to go!
Fucking Magoo.
What are you doing here?
Didn't have time
to tell you we were coming.
Didn't know we were coming, actually.
Just kept on driving.
Forgot to fucking stop!
Check this out!
Joined up a couple of months ago.
What for?
Needed a job, didn't I?
They put you through school.
- Still get to keep the hair short.
- You look like a fucking hippie!
Fuck!
I thought you wanted
to shoot guns, mate.
I want to get in a fucking sub.
Fire torpedoes.
How are you?
We're the handsome Canberra boys.
Come to see
the ugly Melbourne boys.
This is my mate Magoo.
That's Jacqui.
And that's Flea.
Hi.
Got something for you, boys.
Macka pulled it from
the basement of the war museum.
Standard issue for the Hitler Youth.
Cheap alloy. Doesn't look that good.
They were made towards the end of the war.
They were running out
of metal then, weren't they?
You don't want it?
- I'll take it.
- Fifty bucks.
Thirty.
Forty then.
Come on, Davey,
you're robbing me of fifty, mate.
That's all I got.
How long are you staying for?
Come on.
Here. Pay me back
next dole cheque.
- Magoo!
- Champ, man!
- Hey, how's Billy?
- Can I have look, Dave?
- He got Eileen up the duff.
- It looks all right.
- It'll be all right.
- Tommy's going to kill him.
I'll change that bandage
for you later on.
He's going to fucking kill him!
Any parties happening
in this shitty town?
Orr, Bubsy!
Oy, Davey! Cop a drink!
Nice party, mate.
I've got to get
the first bus back to base.
You enjoy being cannon fodder
for the system?
It's a job.
See you, Hando.
Hey, Flea.
You look like shit, Davey.
Stupid little bugger.
Why do you go in for all this stuff?
Because I don't want to be
a white coolie in my own country.
Because it's not our country anymore.
Because rich people...
and powerful people brought in
boatloads of human trash.
Cheap labour.
Gooks mainly.
And there's going to be more.
I want people to know that I'm proud
of my white history and my white blood.
One day, it might be all I have.
But I don't want to go
the same way as the fucking Abbo.
See that map?
That's all the gook properties
in Barclay Street.
A few years ago
that was a white area.
"Mein Kampf."
- Do you know it?
- It's about war, isn't it?
This book was written by Adolf Hitler.
Got turned into a joke by people who don't
want you to know Hitler's view of the world.
It's simply about...
the on-going struggle of the white race
and the enemies it faces.
If you don't know who the enemy is,
you can't win the war.
Listen.
"All the noble cultures
of the past declined"
because the purity and vigour
of the originally
created race faded out.
They were compromised
by the seed of lesser races
who were attracted to
the works of the superior men.
The undeniable reason
for their decline
was then due to a kind of
racial blood poisoning.
"Racial blood must then be preserved
in it's purity at all costs."
Well, how does it feel to own a pub?
It's a dump.
Shut up.
The money will be transferred
to your account in thirty days.
Did you finalize your plans
for the old place?
We will turn the place
to a restaurant with bar.
For my sons to run
when a little older.
If they are smart enough.
Well.
- You're going to root it, Bubsy.
- I don't care. Fuck Harold!
I'm just going out for
about an hour. Mister...
- his sons want to have a look around.
- All right.
Ten metres.
Ten metres by twelve.
Can we keep
one of these tables at home?
What do you want it for?
You're a lousy player.
Do something useful.
Go and get us some lunch.
And remember,
no greasy souvlaki shit.
This red's going to do
lovely things for your eyes.
- Just watch my makeup, OK?
- All right, don't move then.
What are you eating that rubbish for?
You got rocks in your head? Geez!
I'm not living with no fat bitch.
Hando!
Gooks down at the Railway Hotel!
- Stop there!
- But I want to come!
Stay here! Piss off, Bubs!
Fuck you, you bastards!
Fuck you, I'm going!
Do you want to come?
How you going?
Right!
Shut up!
Time to die, gook!
Time to fucking die!
Let's break some fingers.
Tiger! Fucking skinheads!
They've got my brothers.
Get the guys. Get the guys.
Skinheads!
What are you doing here, Bubs?
You were told not to come here! God!
Fuck off, shithead!
Let me through!
Fuck me!
What's happening?
What are you doing here?
Why don't you bloody well do
what you're told, woman?
- I thought I told you to stay at the shop.
- They're only kids!
Who says?
We hate you, gook.
We'll never let you go.
This is our place, gook boy. Our place.
What are you doing here?
The only thing for you here is pain.
We don't love you.
You understand?
I hope you do, mate,
because I don't speak monkey talk!
Give him smack in head, special.
Maybe you got him
enough now, Hando.
- Hit one of them.
- Go on, go for it.
Hando!
Hando! There's gooks!
There's thousands of them!
Monkeys! Monkeys!
How do you like it?
Do you fucking like it, man?
Do you fucking like it?
Brett!
Wait for Brett, you bastards!
- Come on!
- Fuck!
Fuck this, bastards!
Fucking dogs!
Fucking move!
Come on, you wankers!
Fucking move!
You fucking yellow bastards!
Fuck you!
What happened?
What are we going to do?
There's fucking thousands of them!
- There's millions of them!
- Shut up!
- Shut up, I said!
- They got Champ, Luke and Magoo.
And Brett!
Why didn't you all stop and help?
What did you keep running for?
What do you expect?
You fucking little dickhead!
There's fucking billions of them!
- Where's Jacqui?
- We should have stopped!
- Bullshit!
- Anyway, we're all in for it now.
- Like fuck, Sonny!
- Hando, they're at the front door!
Come in. Come on.
You fucking filthy slope head scum.
You filthy yellow monkeys!
What the fuck are you afraid of?
This is our place.
No more running.
We stop them here!
You look like a bunch
of scared fucking rabbits.
Through the manhole,
across the roof.
All right, Davey?
Go!
- Fucking move it!
- Don't fucking rush me, you...
Bubs! Come on!
- Hando!
- Let's go!
Keep "stumm", keep your head down.
They don't know we're here yet.
Gabe! Where's your jacket?
Davey!
Cops. Cops. Let's go.
Fucking skinheads.
Fucking next time, mate.
Rob!
Come on! Rob, open the door!
Rob, open up!
Rob, is that you?
Prick wife-basher.
- What are you doing here?
- Can we talk to you for a while?
- How long is a while?
- I don't know.
- Where's Tracy?
- I'm here, Rob.
How come you stopped
making love to me?
That's it! Get lost!
That bitch smoked my fucking stash.
She's not coming back.
Rob, I know we haven't
known each other for long,
but we feel bad
about what happened
and we'd like to give you some money,
if only to pay for the food we ate.
You two have money? Pigs!
Rob, don't be a bastard.
- We want to make it up to you.
- Well, stick it in the hole.
If you want this money, then have
the decency to see us face to face.
Serves you right, you wanker.
- I'll get you, you maggots!
- Shut up!
Come on, guys. Let him go.
How's it going?
Yeah!
"Yeah"?
Is that all you've got
to say for yourself?
Hello, Chris.
Hello, Chris!
Let's have a tonguey for the skins.
Come on!
- Tonguey for the skins.
- Couple of fucking faggots!
You faggots!
- Faggots!
- Sonny!
We're going to stay here for a while.
You don't want to hang around, do you?
Do you?
Now I'm going to
ask you nicely to leave.
If I see either one of you again,
I'm going to chop your legs off.
OK?
Stupid shit!
Hando? I'm starving, man.
Hippy degenerates.
Hot food!
Yeah.
- So, do you do much cooking?
- Sometimes.
My mum was a good cook.
And I liked Home Eco at school.
They had a great kitchen at Linley.
- Where?
- Linley Hall. It's my old school.
- Well, one of them.
- What is this shit?
Vegetables and pasta sauce.
Anything else?
Well, I used everything we had.
- Hey, Sonny...
- I can put different sauce on it, if you like.
Like the disposal unit?
Bloody wog crap!
Thanks for helping.
Sometimes I live
like a slob, you know?
But when I make the effort...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
All right.
It was an accident.
Gabe?
Gabe!
- What are you doing?
- Davey, do something!
What's wrong?
She's a spastic.
So what's the matter with you then?
Does it happen often?
Sometimes.
- I'm not crazy or anything.
- No one said you were.
I just get these fits sometimes.
There's stuff I can take for it.
Let's get a shotgun
and spray Harold's window.
Shotguns are for Elmer Fudd, dickhead.
I vote we get a.45 automatic
and blow the head gook
back to Singapore.
Saigon, stupid.
I fired a.45 at a range once.
It was far out.
You never used a.45.
Don't shit me, Sonny.
What would you know, Baby Bubs?
An anti-static gun's big news for you.
We can get any sort of gun we want
from Bully at the Red Room.
All we need is the cash
and we need it up front.
- If you lot are going to shoot people...
- We're going.
Then go.
We don't want any fucking
passengers from here on in.
So fuck off.
Sonny, do you
want to come with us?
No.
I want to kill gooks.
Gooks! Gooks!
- We could go fruit picking.
- I hate the fucking country. Don't I?
All right then.
- You'll all end up fucked!
- You'll end up fucked if you don't piss off!
You fucking moles!
I want guns.
Luke, Magoo, Champ, Brett...
I want revenge.
Bully handles cars.
Yeah, fuck cars.
Let's go do a burg.
You want to knock over
a house, do you?
What about it?
I know a place you could do.
It's better than anything
you got on your minds.
Is that you?
Hi.
Shut your mouth!
You're not going to
hit me again, are you?
How are your renovations going?
Bloody endless.
More Bundy and less coke.
See, I remembered.
Are you going to stay?
No, this is just a visit.
God.
I love you. Do you know that?
Sorry.
I'm going to the loo.
I'll be back in a sec.
- Nice place you have here.
- Who the hell are you?
We came to wreck everything
and ruin your life.
God sent us.
- Cheers, mate. Good on ya.
- To Martin, the big, fat, rich pig.
Fucking suck shit!
- Fuck, mate!
- You mug!
- Thanks, Martin.
- Shit!
Fuck, mate.
- What's in it?
- Wack it in there, mate.
That's shit, isn't it?
Could be worth something.
The guns will be worth a lot.
Hey, Gabe.
Bubs!
Hey, Hando, I found one
without the barrel filled in.
It doesn't work, though.
None of them work, Bubs.
The firing pin's been ground down.
Still looks good, though.
What does this bastard do anyway?
He used to be in advertising,
but he made films.
He did "Mortal Blade"
and "Last Blood".
They came out last year.
Did you see them?
So, how do you know him?
He's my dad.
He won an award for this poster.
It's good, isn't it?
Did you see it?
He's very talented, you know.
Go on then. You fucking shit.
Hurry up, come on. Let's get it
fucking loaded so we can piss off.
What a fucking tragedy
breaking this up for parts.
Cackles!
Just be fucking careful, all right?
Martin really loved this car.
Blotted his copy book with
that piece of shit though, didn't he?
Jap crap.
Fuck you!
Why are you doing this to me?
I want to see you squirm.
Incredible little bitch.
- I loved you.
- That wasn't love.
Let me go, Gabrielle.
Why didn't you love Mum?
Did she know about us?
Did she?
Sometimes...
I think she killed herself.
She died in an accident.
An accident,
that's all there was to it.
I loved her.
And I loved you.
Shut up!
And you wanted me.
Next time I'll aim at your skull.
Check this out.
"Timmy and Ted went to bed
dressed in red dressing gowns."
- Who's Timmy and Ted?
- My cats.
I used to always do this.
That's my brother Nicholas.
He's gay now.
Cute though.
You're cute too.
Give me a look.
It looks all right.
See, Hando doesn't act
like he likes me.
- He likes you though, doesn't he?
- He's my best mate.
I want him to go away
on a holiday with me.
Just him and me.
And you.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
You like me, don't you?
Don't you?
I'll kill you, boy!
It's locked!
Hando, he's got a gun!
Get fucking in!
Gabrielle!
Stop doing that to your hair.
You look fucking pathetic.
And while you're at it,
keep the fucking noise down as well.
I told you to shut up!
- What's wrong with you?
- You, you dumb slut. Shut up!
Don't go crazy at me just because
you and your mates fucked up.
You had it all on a plate. But no,
you had to play silly buggers with the car.
Why couldn't you
just take his stuff and go?
You're a loser.
Don't call me that.
No one ever calls me that!
I was going to give her to you anyway.
I want you to go.
I'm sick of looking at you.
Go! We're finished. You're out.
- Just like that?
- Yes.
All right then.
All right.
You...
- You'll all end up...
- Shut up!
You live like shit!
You can't even
look after yourselves!
You're just hopeless!
Where the fuck are you going?
I'm going home.
Well, good riddance to you, boy!
Maybe you'll get that fuck
you've been after for so long.
Davey!
What are you leaving us for?
You're leaving us for her?
You're a suck! You're weak!
You're piss weak and gutless!
Fuck off, little Bubs.
I thought you were strong.
You're weak!
You're nothing!
Gabe?
- Leave me alone!
- Gabe!
Look...
- There's something I've got to do.
- Well, can I come?
No.
Have you got a piece of paper?
No.
Bubs.
If ever you need me or want me,
I'll be at this address.
Is that Footscray Police?
Listen,
I know where there's some people
that you might be looking for.
- Shut up, cockhead!
- Christ!
Got cut off yesterday.
- Anyone know we're here?
- No. No way.
Is there a tap outside?
I don't know.
I thought you were
supposed to be my scout?
Drop it! Drop it!
- Hurry!
- Right!
No!
Come on, copper!
You murdering fucking...
You fucking...
Fuck off, pig!
Fuck off, you fucking pigs!
Lezz-slut!
Fuck you!
I'll fucking kill you!
- I surrender.
- Too fucking late.
That's right, you know the rules.
They're smiling at you.
You have a lovely smile too.
Thank you.
David!
Someone here to see you.
She looks like a tramp.
Don't worry, Grandma.
Hi, Gabe.
Why don't you bring your friends into
the house and entertain them in there?
We're OK out here, Gran.
You don't look right without
your jacket with all the badges.
Well, my Grandma, you know,
she doesn't know about that.
She doesn't like the badges or anything.
I don't want to upset her.
It's her place.
What's this?
That's my matchbox collection.
My dad...
he's an industrial diver.
He travels all around the world. See?
Amsterdam,
San Francisco,
Venice,
Perth,
Naples.
I think he's in Sydney
working on the Sydney Harbour tunnel.
I haven't got a box from there?
I love you.
I love you too.
Don't ever leave me.
Hando!
- They killed Bubs.
- What?
The cops come.
They took everybody else.
They killed Bubs.
How did they know
where to get us?
She's been with me
since she left the squat.
She hasn't told anyone.
Shit!
What is wrong?
Why are my "Lieblings" barking so?
- It's just a cat.
- What?
A cat. They've seen a cat.
We don't get many cats in this yard.
Is that girl still here?
I'm not running a brothel.
I'm alone, Gran.
You can't come in.
I'm not dressed.
They'll find you here.
They'll come looking for you.
You know that.
Yeah.
I think we should stick together.
Past is past, right?
We're all we've got left, Davey.
What do you want to do?
I've got a plan, mate.
Let go of him!
You'll kill him!
Stop it! You don't have to...
- No! He's fucking killed him!
- Shut up!
- No! He's fucking killed... No!
- We're never going to get out of this.
- Is he dead?
- Is the car full?
- Is he dead?
- Yes.
- Is the car full?
- Yes.
The jerry? The fucking jerry?
Yes!
- Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Why'd you fucking kill him?
We'll drive all night and dump
this piece of shit in Adelaide.
I haven't been to the beach in years.
- Be all right if we stay here a while?
- Not long.
I think we should go west.
I'll get you through this,
I promise.
Davey!
We just have to stick together.
I'm not afraid.
She's sick, mate.
She's trouble.
She doesn't really want you.
She'll just use you.
You won't get
nowhere with her, Davey.
- She needs medicine or something.
- She's my problem, isn't she?
- Listen to me.
- Take your hands off me!
- I'm sick of listening to you, all right?
- She's desperate.
She'll drag you down, Davey.
She doesn't love you,
if that's what you think.
Is that what you think?
She's fucking desperate, that's all.
Davey, she's going to
drag us both down.
Besides which,
you don't want her involved if...
we get caught,
for last night, do you?
We've got to get rid of her.
She can have a share of the money.
Can't be fairer than that.
Do you want to tell her?
I'll tell her, if you want.
You're not just dumping her.
We'll give her fucking
two hundred bucks. All right?
You've looked after her
as far as you can.
Are you going to tell her?
I'm with her,
and she's with me.
Well, Davey, I tried.
What's that?
It's where the fucking car is!
- What happened?
- Gabe!
What happened,
you mental bitch?
Mental bitch!
I heard what you two said.
I know what you're going to do.
You suck, Davey.
You can't do anything without him.
- It was me who called the cops.
- What?
I called them.
No!
Hando!
Davey!
I told you, you stupid cunt!
I fucking told you!
You bitch! You're fucking dead!
Gabe!
Are they all right?
I'm not sure.
Stay.
