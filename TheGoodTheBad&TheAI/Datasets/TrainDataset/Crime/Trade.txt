Mom, i bought it, it's paid for.
Why can't you behave, like your sister for an example..
You wouldn't talk to me like this, if your father was here.
Well he's not here!
Be back later, mom.
Will you be back later today to spend the night?
You will be back later, no?
You can't use this bike, i forbid it.

Hey! Hey...

What's the matter? What's going on?
What's the matter?
Hey you, son of a bitch,

Tell that to your mother!
Realy!
Realy!

Let's go! Hurry up move! Faster!
Show me! Where you found it?
Right there.
Hey!
Hey! Where you going?
Jorge, what are you doing?
That was my sisters!
Why?, why?
Did you see the girl on the bicycle?
My son is a sleep, and i can't...
god help you.
Nobody saw a damn thing,
it's time to go and see don victor.
Let's go!
If she was taken in this part of city,
it means the russian took her.
Russian?
They're animals.
They buy and sell anything they get there hands on.
A pretty girl, like your sister, it's very possible,
And for them a virgin... is solid gold.
She's only 13, don victor.
Please tell me, where i can find her!
Help me please!
With the russian?
They're everywhere.
Heard about globalization?
It's rediculess.
How about in mexico city, don victor.
What are you gonna do?
Go there and knock on his door?
I am not afraid of them.
Besides, my friends will back me up.
These two blockheads?
Look at them!
You don't have any idea about the russian!
You guys wont be a treat to them
They will go with me!
Why the long faces?
Are we not in fact brothers?
She is my sister, god damn!
You chickenshits!
It's my sister, for christ sake!
Kiss my ass, jerkoffs!
Calm down!
Calm down!
Calm down right now!
Stay calm!
Take it easy...
easy.
If they really taken her, she's probably in route by now.
In route where?
After they kidnapp the girls, they get'm across the border
As soon as possible and there they sell them, they do the same thing over and over again.
If it is who i think it is, they always use the same routine.
They stay usually in a place close by the airport.
And they get more money if they sell them to...
pedophiles.
Thanks you
In there
Don't touch me, please.
Come on, lay down and enjoy yourself.
We know, where your son is.
Mexico - The cheapest way there?
This here is the best choice.
I need to make some money, so i can take my son to america.
Mom is back!
You'll be very happy with this travel package, i agree it's the best way,
The names and the address of my parents, is that realy necessary?
Usual bureaucratic procedure.
It's here.
Why! Is it necessary for us to be here?
No it's not necessary.
Take this.
Vitamins... i'll help for the pain.
Take it,
understand!
Do you speak spanish?
English?
A little.
Me too... a little.
I wish all this would end.
I want to go home, i miss my mother.
You believe in it?
You pray to it?
Yes.
Very strong.
She's great, she'll make my brother to find me.
You have a brother?
That's good.

Detective sheridon, how exactly did you get involved in this case?
Ray not only investigates insurance fraught.
But in resent ocations he also get's involved with...
Detective jefferson, no offence, but i like to hear the story fom detective sheridon himself.
The bottom line is, this girl will be auctiont of in a few hours,
And i need to know what you guys gonna do about that auction,
Look we've been monitering this group for quit some time.
We know where there jersey oporations are.
Ray, the real problem is that this thing is global
Even though this group might be based in mexico city, they have oporations all over the u. S..
And over every one of the continents.
Their server for example, is located somewhere in maldives.
Their banking is in south africa.
There are many jurisdictions at work here
Cia, state department, the
interpol extr... extr...
So what we do is fallow the money, connect all the dots and we'll come up with the source.
I get all that, but you know where the oporation is in new jersey.
Yea.
But you can't be bother and do anything about this little mexican girl,
You got bigger plans.
That's what you're saying, or did i hear you wrong?
Well gentlemen, if you excuse me?
Thanks you
We are the fucking gringos, aren't we?
Sorry?
I said we are the fucking gringos!
Hi patty, i'll be home in a few more days.
I want you to take out a big junk
of money from our savings.
But i don't wanna do it unless you say it's
alright.
I guess i wont have to ask, what it's for.
I'll tell you all about it when i get
home, and i promise no more secrets.
Have you found her?
Karla?
Karla that's her name?
Yea.
Ray... if you find your daughter,
i want you to bring her home.
If i do, i will.
Patty...
yea?
Thanks you
You shouldn't thank, me for loving you ray.
Bye bye.
Hey, hey, what's going on?
I got us some money, you and me gonna do the auction.
And what about your friend?
Forget about him.
Sure you got tell to me something gringo.
Why are you doing this?
Who is it?
It's my daughter.
Your daughter?
Yea.
This is what you've been looking for?
That picture was taken 10 years ago, i realy don't know what i'm looking for.
I met her mother just after i was married
To patty my wife,
and i was a happely married man
And then i met elenore,
and everything changed. She was...
Oh she was so... wild and alive.
I don't know what i was expecting
but i was ready to give up everything.
My marrige everything, so stupid!
Stupid...
And then she met this other guy and...
He was everything i wasn't, i mean...
she found him exiting... and alive...
Anyway and then she told to me, that she was
pregnant with his child. And a...
That kind of did it, i left and a...
went back to patty
Did patty take you back?
Yeap.
Go figure.
That would never happen in mexico.
Just a few days ago i get a knock at my door from a couble of officers and they told me that elenore has died.
From an overdose.
And they found this letter in her apartment with my name on it.
That she's written 10 years
before, but never sent.
And she says she needs money, and that karla is my daughter.
Which i always... wonderd about.
You didn't know she had a daughter did you?
I did.
We had our ups and downs years
We helped her out all we could,
but she's always in trouble
And the daughter?
In foster homes mostley,
but i always managed to get her back.
After you.
She went over the border to
juarez about ten years ago.
Probably at the time when she
wrote you that letter.
Was her daughter with her?
We have no idea.
We do know, that she got back here
two years later,
The girl was gone
And the house was still a mess.
Did you...
Did you ask her what happend to the daughter.
She told us that she left her with her daddy.
We didn't know what kind of daddy she was talking about?
We couldn't proof anything, what are you talking about?
We think, she sold the girl
i don't know, but with junkies that happends
She sold her.
If i... if i gotten that letter 10 years before, everythingl would be different.
Me and patty always wanted a child.
She's pretty, ain't she?
Yes, she has beautiful eyes.
Green.. Like her mothers.
So, that's what you where doing in the house in juarez.
Well, by the time you cliemed in to my trunk,
i've pretty much givin' up on everything.
But now i relized i gave up to soon.
Wich is something i do a lot of...
I guess.
Veronica, i hope, you are happy in heaven.
