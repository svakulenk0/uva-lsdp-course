- Who Stole: you.
I wonder who is to blame

We were talking about something else
but actually was about it.

Here is the infirmary.

Registration Nevada, and the
driver is such a Thomas Burrell.
- With clean record.
- Legal.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
Well, I guess you did not come here just to
tell me this, do you?
I have to move on.
Go to somewhere that has
action where I can make a difference.
Like when you worked in the Narcotics
in LA
I do not understand how
dropped everything to come here.
The most exciting thing I've
done in the last 4 days was...
take a cat from a tree.
- Yeah, Somerton has its charm.
- It may be.
Is I never left here, and
'll go crazy if you do not leave.
Think you can help me
get a job in LA?
Los Angeles is not
ball with this whole no.
Look...
I understand you want to change.
You're young,
want to experience adventures.
At your age, all I wanted was to go to LA
wanted to be part of the action.
But now...
looking back, I think
different.
But if that's what you want,
of course I'll help you.
Morning.
Thanks for coming so quickly and so early.
This is a top secret operation.
In 45 seconds, it will take a
prisoner on death row.
This prisoner is Gabriel Cortez.
Cortez is the head of Cartel
cruellest since Pablo Escobar.
Let's make sure this guy
never see the light of day.
Let go off the radar.
Let's start.
Oh, no! My God!

So begins soon!
Cheque entire building that has
a camera pointed at the street.
See if you can identify the license plate

I look like a sucker?
Want me pegunte him that?
Not, ask why he's dressed like
.
Why is with that outfit?
Why are you dressed like that?
He said it
supporter of the Dutch team.
- And what does this have to do?
- The soccer team.
Is wearing the team colours.
You're mocking
with my face, right?
Okay. I get into the game.
Country that the "Dutch" come from?
He said the arm is aching because you
grabbed him tightly.
He'd catch something.
I worried about my life.
I tried to hit you.
I should have hit harder.
This is bullshit.
Now you speak my language, is it?
If you understand Spanish,
know I was talking a lot of nonsense
.
Ok, trickster.
Who was in the street at 4 am?
We're in Vegas, man!
Lord, we find something.
- Ray Owens. What?
- Hi, sheriff.
Christie's . I woke you?
No, no. I was already awake.
Is that... I got
to open the restaurant
and milk had not been delivered yet
.
Is that really a police matter?
Mr. Parson
always delivers fresh milk early.
I do not care  milk. The movement is
bit on weekends.
But he was always punctual,
from what I remember.
- I'm worried about him.
- Ever thought of calling him?
That old fashioned and stubborn
has no phone.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot.
I fear he infracted. Sorry
him awake.
Is that... there was nobody here
and I did not know who to call.
You acted correctly, Christie.
I'll send one of my assistants
there to look at it.
- Okay?
- Thank you, Sheriff.
Okay. Goodbye.
Cortez and his men dropped
a sedan white
and split into 2 different cars.
And right now,
think Cortez is in here.
Stop right there!
- What car is this?
- Where's Mitchell? He understands.
- Mitchell! Come here!
- Lord?
Increase . Look.
View . What car is this?
I think is a ZR-1.
- And what the hell is a ZR-1?
- A Corvette ZR-1.
This one was modified
pras fairs cars.
Is a monster on wheels.
Appeared in everything
newspaper 2 days ago. It was stolen in LA.
Normally Corvettes have a 700 hp,
but this has more than 1,000.
We a psychopath in a Bat mobile.
How do we stop this?
Uh... exploding it?
And if you have a hostage inside?
Legal. Let's move to
Intelligence.
This is the car that we seek.
The car we're looking
is a modified Corvette ZR-1.
I see the photo here.
Warning when I locate it.
Hi, officer.
Enabling and car documents.
Yes, sir.
My qualification...
and the car documents.
Is the Corvette!
I repeat: the Corvette!
Then, Jerry...
Easy, cowboy. Do not enter the yard
Parson unannounced.
Know how it is. Right?
Hey, Mr. Parson!
Jerry Bailey's!
Only came to know the Lord, then
not shoot at us, okay?
- Let's go around the back.
- Okay.
Damn!
Cannot open.
Hey, genius, why not try
doors first?
Mr. Parson?
I'll look up there.
You search here.
Cortez spent
breaking the barrier.
But airports are closed.
Will not fly away.
Want a lock here.
Nothing can pass.
What is he trying to do?
Pro Going south on 95?
He thinks he's going to
Mexico, but will not get.
- Why do not you get a helicopter?
- The ZR-1 is faster
than any helicopter.
It's more than that.
Cortez is the 3rd generation of leaders
cartel.
He thinks he's untouchable.
Is how his mind works.
He wants to be at the helm.
- Literally.
- How so?
Cortez pilot racing cars
since adolescence.
Father built a clue him in Sinaloa.
He flies on the professional circuit
South American with a nickname.
I saw him riding.
He's very good.
Silence. Silence!
- Here is Bannister.
- Are you having a good day?
Tues.
This can only end in 2 ways.
And you know what?
Glad to anyone.
Can I cut it into pieces
and send it by mail for you.
've killed a federal agent,
Gabriel.
If you kill one more, I guarantee that
not have nowhere to hide.
Listen, how will you explain to parents
she had come home in bags?
Call your people back
and out of my way.
- Any option I like.
- Let me talk to her.
Sorry, John. I screwed up.
Sorry.
I'll get you this.
Okay? Do not worry.
If you try to stop me,
many people will die needlessly.
Right now, I'm just a guy who left
for a spin.
- Will not give it to explode.
- Shut the fuck up!
- Yes?
- Ray, we are the home of Parson.
A positive identification:
ZR-1-gray metallic
followed by U.S. Interstate-95.
We can see the hostage
in the vehicle.
- You are almost there, chief.
- Understood.
Relax. We are ready this guy.
Not trust either.
Cortez can always surprise.
And remind your men
who has a hostage in the car.
Arriving at the Arizona border.
Should get soon.
Understood.
Are all in position.
Fix up.
Want you to have a good view of the show.
What?
Back!
My God!
Looks like a war zone down there
.
Damn!
I'm already on the way.
And do not forget:
This is a crime scene.
Not touch anything.
Understood, sir.
Is the following: we have a
broken window, ok?
In my opinion,
was a robbery that went wrong.
I wonder what made Parson:
He came and surprised them.
It may have been that.
Has anyone checked the tire marks?
They came here first.
- I'll check.
- Go with him.
Yes, sir.
- Show me the body.
- Right here.
Oh, Jesus!
No burn in drilling.
The bullet went through him.
There was a gun that did it.
Know which way did they go?
Direct pro canyon. Come.
$ 3 million in an account in Switzerland as
combine.
Know, in my country the police
say "gracias" after being paid.
Has even driving like a maniac?
I can stop pretending I
hostage now?
Ooops! Sorry.
What is this?
- Adrenaline!
- What?
Lost eye contact!
He just disappeared!
- How? Give back!
- Let's look around.
He's gone!
How so "disappeared"?
Keep looking!
Has to continue! Look! Find it!
Bastard!
He killed out here, and then took the body
inside.
How long he arrives at the border?
That speed between 65 and 75 minutes.
Shortcut that he is taking
canyon is most of the time.
Can increase this to me, please
?
The intercept point is here:
Los Algodones.
I know the police chief
that border.
It's kind of tough.
And the passage
was reformed last year.
Concrete walls pure
retractable steel barriers on the ground.
Is a fortress.
Cortez would not
behind a target without a plan of action.
Whatever plan will be prepared.
Email people to Algodones.
Reinforce passage.
Right. And what do you think of this city?
Somerton Junction.
Not have an official pass.
But the point closest to the road.
Wait.
The ravine is too deep to cross
.
Is unlikely.
But let's not ignore that.
I'll call the sheriff.
Say that out of the way.
- Hello?
- Sheriff Owens?
- Myself. Who is this?
- John Bannister, the FBI.
- We have a problem.
- Can talk.
Has a fugitive following
to the Mexican border.
There is a small chance he
try to cross it by Somerton Junction.
Is more likely than not try, but
I will send a SWAT a precaution.
No offense, but they only
can handle it.
Cannot talk now. I got to go.
What?
I do not know.
The FBI says a fugitive
may be coming our way.
Seriously? So we have action!
This is no coincidence.
First the guys in the cafeteria,
now this.
The two things are connected.
We have to talk with Bailey and Torrance.
Shit!
What light is that?
Will they?
Think they are so stupid
to stay here?
Devils. Give me the gun.
Stop the car! Stop!
What the fuck?
Bailey and Torrance,
where are you?
Follow some tire brands up the canyon
on the side south of the city.
Has anyone here.
We are going to check the foot.
Negative. Go back
immediately. Got it?
Gimme that.
Ray, have lights on.
Has something big going on here!
Ray, are you listening?
Ray, are you listening?
Stop!
Jerry, run!
- Sarah!
- Go!
They're shooting at us!
Are many!
Night Vision.
Lights out. Now.
Shit!
Jerry, are you legal?
Can you come here?
I can!
Wait!
- Jerry is there! He was shot!
- I'll cover you!
Ok!
Use the missile launcher!
Jerry, we got to go! Come on!
Vai, vai, vai!
- Is anyone following us?
- Negative, I'm not seeing headlights.
Great.
Are you okay?
Oh, God, Jerry!
's Still bleeding.
It's nothing serious.
Find the wound and apply pressure.
Sorry. 'S Alright, alright.
Take care. Blood stains are difficult
out of uniform.
Think I'm calling? Are you
vai even wash it after...
we'll mend.
Think Frank will be jealous if
see us like this?
You can talk to your colleague
he is losing his time.
I do not go to prison.
Yeah, he likes you.
Hang on, Jerry. Please.
Jerry! Hang on, Jerry.
Ray, run!
Jerry...
- Come on.
- Oh, Ray ..
Ah, Jerry...
Sarah!
Sarah!
Not believe he is dead.
He was talking about you...
just before he died.
And what did he say?
Asked me to go easy on you.
That you're not so bad.
As well "gave police work"?
- What kind of work?
- Listen...
will be ready on time?
Yes, you will not have problem.
I just hope
fulfill its mission.
I do not care any more excuses.
Shit!
Bannister talking. How long will it take
the SWAT team?
Your prisoner is trying
to cross the border here.
What are you talking about?
Hence it does not.
Because the canyon, in the southern part,
is very narrow.
Has a full staff there with
military experience heavy weapons.
They're building a bridge over the Mobile
canyon!
- Really? You think?
- I know. I saw those guys.
Exchanged shots with them!
- Gabriel Cortez.
- What?
And why did not you tell me this before
?
My cop would still be alive if I knew that
!
Not have time to explain every detail
.
Why not give a saucy to patrol?
Look, I do not know you, nor am
and his subordinate!
Motherfucker!
Hung up on me.
Sheriff psychotic.
Phil, call the SWAT captain.
Now.
And get me a map of Somerton.
I want to see something.
- Mr.
- Captain, has a chance...
of the Cortez for trying to cross
Somerton.
When you get there, if you feel
destroy a bridge.
Yes, sir.
A movable bridge...
SWAT is there front.
What will you do?
Death does not arrive when you expect.
Piloting a race car...
or in a shootout...
Death awaits in the kitchen when you lift
night
to get a glass of milk.
My niece,
the oldest of my sister,
was a good girl.
I practically raised her.
Then one night,
I bumped into her in the kitchen
me a gun.
If she had not wavered, my brain would
there scattered across the kitchen floor
and not hers.
Shit!
Do not try to see death coming, because
not see.
SWAT will not arrive.
We're on our own?
So who is going to stop this guy
Cortez?
This problem is the feds.
He was in their custody.
They is the guy who lost.
Should not be our problem.
Maybe not.
But if it passes through our city,
is our problem, yes.
But... We can close our eyes.
Let's do this.
If we do,
is better playing off the badge.
Ray, come on.
Cannot.
Jerry died because of that guy.
Ray, you know me.
I'm not a coward.
I'd love to pick a fight with those guys
by Jerry.
But Cortez is much for us.
He has an army.
Look,
if you want to leave this,
's okay by me.
I will not criticize them for that.
But I will not let this guy
enter our city without fighting.
I also took an oath, Ray.
Ray, it seems you are needing help
.
I can help you.
Your aim is still good as it was?
Military
memory lasts a long time.
Frank, I've seen many
you start things and not finish.
Jerry was my friend.
I would never abandon my friends.
Can release it.
You will be my helper.
I will not disappoint you.
Okay, okay.
Now we are four. Are you happy?
Phil...
want financial information from all
Division.
Even mine. No exceptions.
Cortez have someone here that
warned him about his transfer.
I wonder who is. Right?
Ray, I...
I want to tell you something:
When I was with Jerry
in the middle of shooting,
I was terrified.
I could not get my hands to stop shaking.
Look, this is normal.
Everyone is so
in the middle of a firelight.
I'll tell you a secret:
Probably I'm more afraid than you
this time.
What?
But why?
Because I've seen a lot of blood and death.
I know what's going to happen.
Ask Washington to send
an image in real time
the region around Somerton.
If the sheriff is right,
have 100 federal agents idly
bordering Los Algodones
are blurring without reason.
- What is the fastest way?
- A Challenger jet.
Make.
Ready?
Yes, but let's face like everyone
firepower
with a pair of shotguns?
I have an idea.
I have two conditions that must accept
before I do anything.
- Sing it.
- I want to be a cop like Frank.
Thus any damage caused to me or that I
cause,
will be responsibility of the police force
and Sheriff Somerton Junction.
Put your hand here.
I nominate this instant
Dinkum Lewis,
to be assistant sheriff
from this day,
or until their services
are no longer needed
the people of Somerton Junction.
- Witnesses?
- I witness.
- What else?
- Huh?
Second condition.
I want to take the "Georgette".
I'm the only one who knows how to use it.
Okay. Come on.
You can also use it, Ray
And you, Frank.
- Thanks.
- Let's go.
- Jesus Christ, Lewis!
- Caramba!
What a beauty!
Where'd you get that?
"Vicky"? She is my
killer-of-Nazis.
Vickers Machine Gun 1939.
Is my "bitch-doidinha."
it cannot legally be used.
But I put back the missing pieces
and theoretically it works.
Course this is between us and God.
Uncle Sam does not need to know.
- Has more ammunition?
- Some cartridges.
So bring everything you have.
Did
think will fight in a Crusade?
Never know.
We meet in the main street
in 5 minutes.
Cars also need to do the blocking.
I drive the old "Henrietta" here.
Why idiots
gives nicknames for everything?
Only for things that I love.
Come on.
Okay. I inform after landing.
Upgrade me.
Border patrol responded,
but it will take 1 hour to arrive.
- And the National Guard?
- More time yet.
- And the Army?
- Only authorizes the president.
We only have 45 minutes.
Cortez will have to go through
main street to get to the canyon.
The only other option is
by Alzamora St.
Torrance, vai with Frank and Lewis
and lock it.
"Figue"
and I'll warn civilians.
Understood.
- Hi, Ray.
- Listen, my friends...
a fugitive
is coming to our city.
Is very dangerous to stay here.
I want everyone go home!
You heard what I said?
- Just ask the coffee!
- It's for safety of you.
You are talking to a 72 year old
with high cholesterol,
eating bacon and cheddar omelette with.
You really think I'm afraid of death?
Not look at me.
I asked the same thing.
Already started preparing.
- Where's Christie?
- Was behind milk.
So stay away from windows,
okay?
- Stay away from windows.
- Right. No windows.
So, what do we do?
Is: put your truck back there
and find more people to use cars.
- I have a better idea.
- Need something bigger.
Maybe three on this side.
Should be enough.
Hey!
- What will you do?
- Clear!
Not do that!
E electrical wires?
Are phone and cable TV!
Electricity is back there!
That's not what I'm talking about!
If you cut the pole
he'll be hanging only by the wires
!
"Geronimo!" "Geronimo!"
Perfect!
Let's put the cars here.
What crap!
Caramba!
- John, you better look at it.
- What is it?
Satellite image
National Security.
This is a live picture of the canyon
Somerton south of Junction.
Check it out.
- It's a bridge.
- Is.
Not believe.
The sheriff was right.
Who is he?
In 1988, came to LAPD
trained with the elite tactical team
.
Narcotics worked in 5 years, and then left
.
Why?
He took a group that moved
half a ton of cocaine.
Won a medal for bravery, but
took 5 shots.
He survived, but another 7
not police.
Was the last straw pro Owens.
He saw much bloodshed
and wanted to leave.
Somerton was to play sheriff.
Thanks.
Yeah, we need two more.
Oh my God!
What are you doing now, Dinkum?
Once you crazy?
Easy there! Almost there!
Dinkum, do not!
Dinkum! Dinkum! You okay?
Oh, my God! You okay?
Henrietta!
Worked!
Good work police. Good job.
Ray, we need something bigger.
I have an idea.
- Torrance.
- The street is blocked.
Great. Speech and pro Dinkum Martinez
find me in the schoolyard.
And I want you on the roof of the old hotel
to be my lookout.
Figue, go to the southern part
check if the buildings are empty.
- I'll be right back.
- I'm going.
Come "kicking a dead horse."
Ai, caramba!
You guys
on Main Street travelling south.
Not the face.
Wait till we get there.
Understood, Ray.
But that hell is that?
This will be fun!
I need two men on the left ...
and 2 on the right.
You can shoot anything that moves
.
If you do not move, shoot it anyway
!
And when we finish, we'll burn this place
!
- Christie! Christie!
- By God, Figue!
Christie, you got to get out of here now
!
What is happening?
Why are these cars so?
Look at that ass.
Christie,
you have to get out of the street!
Why is hidden behind the car?
This one is my kind of woman.
Damn!
Vai! Vai!
Run!
Come! Get down!
How is it? Shoot!
Restaurant...
