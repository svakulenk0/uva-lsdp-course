Christ, it's almost midnight.
Nothing like putting in some overtime
to save a miserable serial killer.
Alleged serial killer.
Right.
- Well...
maybe one of these days we'll actually
defend somebody who's really innocent.
- A man is innocent until proven guilty.
- Until proven guilty.
Look, you and I both know that son of
a bitch killed 14 people in cold blood.
- I just hope there's nothing
to this karma thing.
- Oh, please.
- Ah, come on. What the hell?
And I don't want to hear
anything about any karma.
- What's going on?
- I'm gonna find out.
I'm gonna check out
the elevator shaft.
- Yeah, okay.
- Maybe there's a way out.
- Oh, Jesus.
- What's happening? Are they bats?
- Danny?
Oh, God! Oh, God! Somebody help me!
Please! Please! Somebody help me!
Please!
Oh, God! Please!
No! No! No! No!
Ah, come on. Just when it was
getting to the good part.
- Christ, not again.
Hey, take a little
breather, honey.
I lost my concentration.
Goddamn piece of crap.
Looks like the only thing
working around here is me.
- Sons of bitches.
- That's what you get...
for stealing cable, Buck.
The first full solar eclipse to be seen
locally in over 35 years--
...while transporting
Luther Heggs...
from the Kern County Jail
to the Huntsville State Penitentiary.
Heggs, you may remember,
was convicted for armed robbery.
An unscheduled stop was made
at a gas station rest room.
When Heggs persuaded the deputy
to remove one of the cuffs
so he could use the toilet...
Heggs severely beat the deputy...
wrestled away the key
to the cuffs and fled the scene.
- Looks like Luther beat the dog shit...
- In a moment we'll be speaking...
- out of that boy.
- to legendary Texas Ranger Otis Lawson.
Officer Lawson, could we have the latest
developments concerning Luther Heggs?
Yes. Uh, we have
all available--
Hey, ain't that the old boy who put you
away in that Lubbock bank job?
Rotten bastard.
I'd like to say that...
I-I-I will personally
track down Luther Heggs...
and drag his ass
back to the penitentiary...
where the sorry
son of a bitch belongs.
All right, asshole.
Start talking.
- You got a warrant, Otis?
- Did I give you that?
Damn, Sheriff. I thought I--
Let's see, did you--
- There is it. ls that warrant
enough for you? Huh?
- Forget about the warrant, Otis.
- Okay.
- Thank you for cooperating.
Now, where is he?
Don't say, "Who?"
I ain't heard a peep from him.
Oh, shit. Goddamn.
Luther and me--
We ain't as tight as we once was.
Ever since l went straight.
I don't run in them circles.
Bullshit, Buck.
Goddamn it.
You're a criminal.
You always were, and you always will be.
- Just like your daddy.
- No, I swear to God, Otis.
- I'm selling them Swifty products.
- Shut up.
- Show her the picture.
- You seen this man?
- Yes, I have.
- When and where?
About an hour ago, on the TV.
Do you think we're just wasting
our time coming over here...
like we suck farts
out of a dead chicken?
- She don't know nothing about it.
- She might not, but you sure do.
'Cause you and Luther
are butt-buddies...
from way back.
And sooner or later,
he's gonna contact you...
and when he does,
we'll be waiting.
Don't forget that, slick.
Ma'am.
- Yeah?
- Well, hey, Mama.
- Shit.
Yeah, well, listen, Mama.
I'm gonna have to call you back
a little bit later, all right?
- All right. I love you too.
- Buck... your mama's dead.
- Yeah?
- You clear?
- It is now. Are you okay?
- Yeah. l've been better.
Listen up, man.
That Mexican bank deal is back on.
We gotta move
double fast, though.
- Are you sure the money's still there?
- Yeah, it's still there.
Five million in freshly-laundered...
gringo drug money.
Round up a crew and meet me
at that El Coyote Motel
across the border tomorrow night.
All right, Luther.
Shit. I gotta get out
of here, man.
I'll be in around 7:30,
run the whole thing down to everybody.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
- the champion of champions...
Roddy Pugh!
All right! Yeah!
Hang on, cowboy,
I'm coming. Come here, bull! Come to me!
Come to me, baby!
Come here!
Watch out for that there bull!
Come on! Better run, better run!
There goes Widow Maker!
Howdy, C.W.
Did you see it?
Yep.
I reckon I've lost a step.
I reckon.
So how the hell
are things, C.W.?
Well, I fractured my ass bone...
Fay left me...
I'm three months behind
on my note...
and I had to hock
my horse and trailer.
Goddamn, man. lf your dog was dead,
we'd have us a country song.
Scooter got hit by a car
and killed last month.
Jesus, C.W., I'm sorry.
I was just joking, man.
Oh, hell, Buck. You know me and
good luck was always strangers.
So what's the pitch?
I'm guessing you didn't come here
to scout my clowning skills.
Nah, there's no clowning
involved here.
Luther's got a deal going.
Looks like a good one.
We need you to open the box.
- Is my end more than a hundred thou?
- Way more.
Jesus, it's Buck. Don't shoot,
you paranoid son of a bitch.
Didn't you see the signs?
The only thing I gotta beware of
is your crazy ass. Got a beer?
- Jaws is looking pretty strong.
- Jaws is dead.
I lost him in a fight
a while back.
This is Jaws 2.
I got him on the juice.
You're pumping steroids into a pooch?
Damn, Jesus.
That's immoral.
Hey, it ain't the fuckin' Olympics,
Buck. I mean, this is dog fighting.
He's got a big match coming up.
Hey, go, Jaws, go!
I got a deal
you might want to get in on.
Who's setting up the deal?
- Luther.
- Besides you and Luther...
who else is on the crew?
C.W. Niles and Ray Bob.
Ray Bob?
He's an idiot.
I don't work with idiots.
They get you killed.
Yeah, well, you don't
pick the crew, l do.
And I say he's in.
You don't like it, fuck you.
- What would my end be?
- Figure 600 grand, give or take.
- How's that Lincoln running?
- Like a burnt dead dog.
Good boy!
That's a good boy!
Go, Jaws! Go!
Yeah, that's a good boy.
Bucky!
What the hell!
What do you want to sneak up
on me like that for, huh, Bucky?
That's some tight-ass security
you got going here, Ray Bob.
I thought you was
the damn supervisor.
Oh, hell, Bucky.
There ain't nothing here
to guard anyway.
- So what's up?
- A job's what's up.
Set us up for a good long time.
Yeah?
I don't know, Bucky.
- I mean, Alma's got me
on such a short leash and all.
- Knock it off...
you pussy-whipped son of a bitch.
I'm going out on the line
for you here.
You ain't exactly
everybody's first choice.
Really?
Wh-When-When's this
supposed to happen?
- We hit the road tomorrow.
Going to Mexico.
- What am I gonna tell Alma?
- I don't care what you tell her.
You just pack a bag, bring your .45
and be ready to roll at high noon.
Get some sleep.
- Twice a day.
- Si, senor.
Hey, Buck, C.W.
Nice ride, Jesus.
- Well, l had to
tell her something.
Ray Bob,
we don't need this shit.
Ready.
El Coyote?
What's that mean in American, Jesus?
The coyote.
- It ideal.
- Come in with me, Jesus.
Just in case I gotta talk Mexican.
C.W., take the car down to number seven,
start unloading the gear.
Howdy.
You speak English, lady?
English, Spanish
and a little bit of Japanese.
We need a room.
Number seven will do.
Hey, baby.
El fucko?
Sweet Jesus.
Come on, Jesus.
- Now ain't the time.
Let's get
this crap inside quick.
Yowza, boss.
- This movie is very low quality.
Don't look that bad to me.
- There's no story.
- It's a fuck movie.
I don't watch a fuck movie
for the story.
I watch a fuck movie
to see fuckin'.
I got to side with Jesus
on this one.
I personally appreciate
an attempt at telling a story.
When I care more about the characters,
I care more about the fucking.
Now, my main complaint
about this movie here...
is we've been watching it
for something like a half hour,
- and there ain't been no ass fuckin'.
- Fuck me runnin'.
This is my kind of place.
Christ.
- Howdy.
Give me a shot of tequila, man.
Here you go.
Goddamn, man!
Give me a... shot of whiskey
or something.
Say, what would be the odds
of gettin' a cab out here?
Odds of getting a cab
are about zero to none.
- No cabs come out here.
- Shit.
- You got car trouble?
- Yeah. Weirdest thing, man.
I hit a fuckin' bat.
Messed up my vehicle real good.
Hell, you say.
Where you headed?
- That El Coyote Motel.
- I get off in about half hour.
Would you like a lift?
- Yep?
- Hey, Buck. Broke down, man.
Luther, we were starting
to worry about you, boy.
- Want us to come and get you?
- No, y'all stay put.
This old boy here
is gonna give me a lift.
Mighty decent of you, man.
I appreciate it.
No problem.
What kind of bat
did you hit?
I don't know, man.
A fuckin' bat. A big one.
- You know, there's many varieties of bats.
- Yeah?
I didn't know that.
Damn thing scared the shit
out of me, though.
I pumped
a bullet in the bastard.
Aren't we going
the wrong direction here, man?
Is that your jeep?
Yeah.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry here.
You know what I mean?
Just take a second.
Come on.
You said you hit a big, old fuckin' bat.
Where is it?
Well, man, I imagine it
crawled off somewhere to die.
I don't see no point
in all of this.
Oh, there's a point, all right.
Victor.
Victor.
Victor.
How bad is it?
I don't think
I'm gonna make it.
Damn, man. You need to get
to a hospital, quick like.
ls this him?
Yeah, that's him.
What the fuck
you talkin' about, man?
I ain't never
seen this guy in my life.
I think this belongs to you.
Victor.
- Fuck.
Oh, God!
Come on, fuckin' bat!
Come on!
Look out for the gun!
Adios.
Fuck.
Boy, I'd sure like to do me...
one of them porno star bitches.
I did me one of them
porno star bitches once.
She had a small part
in Splendor in the Ass 2.
- You ever see that?
- No, I never saw it.
But I'd sure go rent it.
Which one is she?
She's in the scene
where Wendy West goes to the dentist.
There's this black
female dentist...
and a red-haired
dentist's helper.
I hammered the redhead.
What happened at the dentist's?
They all fuck each other.
What do you think? lt's a porno movie.
- I know this Mexican guy, Carlos.
He found out his sister
was doing porno in L.A.
So he waited till she was
doing another porno film...
and he went down to the set...
with a shotgun.
And he went completely crazy.
Carlos!
He shot the director.
- He shot the cameraman.
- No! No!
He shot the guy
who was drilling her.
And then...
he even shot the guy...
who brings the doughnuts.
Huh?
Man, this is just so cool, guys.
I mean, I'm gettin' to do
a big job with all my buddies.
- I mean, this is so great.
- Hey, Ray Bob.
Do you know who was asking about you?
- No, who?
- No one.
- Get off his ass, Jesus.
I ain't on his ass yet.
I ain't gonna have internal
squabbling on this deal.
- Where the hell you goin'?
- For a walk.
Yeah, well, don't stray too far.
Luther's due any time.
I bet you my ass he's going over
to that little senorita's room...
- to get his dick wet.
- Kind of figured Luther'd be here by now.
Luther.
What are you doing here?
I just dropped in
for a quick bite.
- What the fuck!
Take that, bitch!
No. No. No. No.
- Who is it?
- It's room service.
Open up, you idiots.
Look who l found.
Hot damn, Luther.
- I ain't seen you in a coon's age.
- C.W.
God Almighty, Luther. We thought
you was never even gonna show up.
I got dropped off
up the road a piece there.
Hoofed it the last mile or so.
Damn, Jesus.
That little split tail
drain the life out of you?
You look like a damn ghost.
She sucked me dry.
Damn.
Hey, Luther.
I just wanted to say I appreciate
you bringing me on this job and all.
All right, girls.
Gather 'round.
The bank's in Bravos,
right here near the border.
When you planning
on pulling this thing off?
- We'll be going on this
little expedition tonight.
- "Tonight"?
God dog, you gotta be kiddin' me.
We got to work things out.
Case the joint, shit like that.
Yeah, Luther, I never knowed you
to go into a deal half-cocked.
We're gonna do this thing my way...
which means we're gonna
do it tonight.
Or all of you are gonna
walk away with nothin'.
Are you homos in or are you out?
I'm in.
Well, I sure as hell ain't walkin' away
from 600 grand and change.
What's the big hurry, Luther?
What the hell are you?
Cinderella?
For one thing, that motel clerk
got a good look at me.
I think she might have made me.
Well, now, you might ought to have
mentioned that to me before.
Well, I'll fill you in
on a need-to-know basis.
Well, I need to know everything.
All right then.
From now on, Buck,
I'll tell you everything.
- Fair enough?
- Yeah.
Are you in or not?
I reckon I'm in.
All right then.
Let's head 'em up
and move 'em out!
What the hell
we need this stuff for?
I think it looks cool.
Just a precaution.
Looks like a goddamn bloodbath.
You tryin' to be funny?
No, sir.
Why don't you go on outside
and get some air?
Yeah.
What's his problem?
My boy's suffering
from some serious hurt.
Them Gecko brothers
killed his daddy.
- You remember old McGraw, don't you?
- Sure.
Sons of bitches shot
old Earl dead in the head.
What the hell
you figure happened here?
God only knows,
and He ain't talkin'.
Jesus, when you guys
are done unloading...
pull the car out in front
of the bank there.
In just a minute...
I'm gonna open this here door.
How the hell
are you gonna do that?
I done told you.
I got this thing all worked out, man.
God Almighty, Luther.
You'd think somebody had done and gone
give you the keys to the place.
What did you have
to kill the guard for?
It was him or me, Buck.
What about the other alarms?
There are a couple of motion detectors
back here by the safe.
You guys won't have
to worry about that.
C.W., crack this box.
Jesus Christ.
- All right, C.W.
Do your magic.
Don't touch nothin' you don't have to.
What's wrong, Luth?
A little asthma attack.
That's all. Let's go.
Yee-ha!
So far, so good, huh, Bucky?
I don't think so, Ray Bob.
We got us a dead guard here.
When them Mexicans catch us, they're
gonna fry our asses or hang us-- one.
Oh, man.
You're a goddamn artist, C.W.
- lt's an honor just watching you work.
Just let me know when you need
the lubricating oil.
What are you tryin' to do,
cornhole me?
Back off a little bit, Luther.
Give me a little room to work here.
And get this goddamn thing
out of the way.
- Luther, you all right?
Asthma, my ass.
I vote we get out of here
while we've still got a chance.
- Cops are on the way.
Let's get out of here.
- Damn it. All right,
time is still on our side.
Now, all those cops can do
is slow us down a little bit.
- "Slow us down"?
Hell, they'll kill our asses.
- We ain't goin' anywhere.
C.W. has almost got this thing licked
now. You just settle your ass down.
- What are you, retarded?
Let's get out of here!
- Back off, man!
We're about to be millionaires.
We're gonna be dead millionaires,
we don't move it.
Get out of here
if you want to. l don't care.
Just leave more for us.
Come on, Ray Bob,
let's get the hell out of here.
- What about the money, Bucky?
- It's over, Ray Bob.
There ain't gonna be no money.
Now, let's go.
You comin' with us?
I'll take my chances.
Well, you're as crazy
as they are.
- What do we do now, Bucky?
- Run!
- Man, they're everywhere.
- Shit!
- They're shootin' at us, Buck!
- Get back inside!
- You said we was gonna make it, Bucky.
- Shut up, Ray Bob!
Hey, I was just starting
to miss you guys.
Listen up, you idiots!
Get out of there and come out
with your hands up...
and we will not kill you.
I give you my word.
Take your time
and think it over.
You've got two minutes.
Ah, Jesus Christ!
Oh, God Almighty.
I don't know how many
of them are in there...
but your boy, Buck,
is one of them.
Well, I'll tell you
one thing, Chief.
You work pretty damn fast.
Hey, baby. I thought I told you
never to call me at work.
- This is Lawson here.
- Otis. Hey, how's your wife tasting?
None of your business,
you son of a bitch.
First off, who the hell are you,
and is Luther Heggs in there?
I'm Jesus, and, yeah,
Luther's here.
And Buck Bowers,
who you know intimately.
Then, goddamn it,
put Buck on.
You stupid bastard.
You're lucky I ain't done
put a bullet in your head.
Yeah?
Well, you cornholed
the pooch this time, boy.
Oh, I'd have to agree with you
on that one, Otis.
There is a bank guard in there
by the name of Reuben Salto Guitierrez.
We want to speak to him.
You got a bank guard in there by
the name of Reuben ""Salsa Goudaresm--""
H-H-How the hell you pronounce it?
Put him on the phone.
- I want to speak to him.
- Uh--
Well, he's still alive, isn't he?
Sure, he's fine.
Well, then put him on the phone.
Give me a minute.
Jesus... tell him
everything's okay in Mexican.
There you go.
Told you he's okay.
Now, listen up, Buck.
Let the guard go.
You guys come out
with your hands up high...
and we promise that
we ain't gonna kill you.
Well, now, Otis, l think
I'm gonna have to pass on that offer.
What about this:
We take the guard with us.
You give us a ten-minute head start,
and then we'll let him go.
- Ain't gonna happen, Bucko.
- Come on, Otis. Work with me here.
Now, the way l figure--
- Hello?
- What the hell are you doin', man?
- That was our last chance
to make a deal!
- There ain't gonna be no deals.
Besides, I'm tired of listening
to your chatter!
My pit ain't the only one
on the juice.
Come on, guys.
Hey, we ain't gotta fight, man.
- Yeah. End of the line, assholes!
- Goddamn it.
That's got it.
You the man, C.W.
You the man!
Good God, Gerty!
What a gorge!
We're right on schedule, buddy.
Got a half hour before sunrise.
- It's the fattest one l ever cracked.
I'll take care of that.
Get one of the guys back here
and bag up the rest of this cash.
What in God's name
is going on up there?
Get out of there!
Get out of there now, damn it!
- What the hell was that all about?
- God Almighty.
I think we're gonna have to make
a radical move here, Ray Bob.
Now, I know this sounds
totally insane...
but I think Luther, C.W.
and Jesus--
- What?
- Hey, look, if I don't go
take a leak right now...
I'm gonna piss in my pants.
Sal, can you see anything
on top of that bank?
I can't see anything up there.
Tear gas everywhere.
Sal? Come in, Sal.
- Sal?
- Sal?
Ray Bob, give me a hand
loading this green stuff.
Shit.
God Almighty.
Where did Luther get off to?
Uh, he's in the can.
Let's get this stuff loaded.
Let's get moving.
Cutting it pretty close.
All right, you assholes.
Get back here and give us
a hand loading this cash up.
Hell, yeah.
Jesus, I do believe you're the greediest
son of a bitch l ever knowed.
- Where's Buck at?
- Breathing down your neck.
- Take it back, Jesus.
You're the second greediest
son of a bitch l ever knowed.
lt's not about the money,
you stupid bastard.
Ray Bob, get over here.
You get away from them.
Don't you cocksuckers
move a muscle.
I want you to drop your guns
on the floor, and l want you
to kick 'em towards me.
Oh, Bucky, what are you doing?
They're vampires, Ray Bob.
I know that sounds fucked-up,
but that's what they are.
And we're getting the hell
out of here, Ray Bob.
Even going to the pen's
better than getting killed
by one of these bloodsuckers.
Buck, you paranoid
son of a bitch.
Now, Ray Bob, even you, dumb fuck that
you are, ain't buying into this, right?
Ray Bob, l wouldn't be willing
to go out there, if l didn't
know what was in here--
- Gettin' to you, boys. Get in there!
- Now!
Fuck.
Hey!
- Hey!
Bucky.
- Bucky.
Bucky.
- The doors!
I never thought
I'd be happy to see you bastards.
Do me a favor.
Take that knife
out of my leg.
Hold it.
You gotta listen to me.
You don't know what you're
dealing with in there.
-Get this piece of shit out of my sight.
-Otis, listen to me!
No, you listen to me! You had
your chance to talk, and you blew it.
Now, goddamn it, the game's over!
Get him in there.
I guarantee you it ain't over!
Otis, it ain't over!
- Otis, listen to me! Otis!
Otis, you gotta listen to me!
Otis!
- Let's do it.
- Otis!
- You don't know what it is in there!
- Go!
You don't know what's in there!
Goddamn it, Otis.
Now will you listen to me?
Let me out of the fucking car,
you asshole!
Ah, shit!
We're toast!
Otis, you got the sun!
What are you waitin' on, man?
Go in there and kill 'em!
I'm not sending any more men in there
to get slaughtered until l figure out...
what the hell it is
we're dealing with here.
Oh, you gotta be
fucking kidding me!
- Oh, shit!
- Come here, you sexy bitch.
You son of a bitch.
What the hell's going on here?
- They're making happy meals
out of our ass.
- They're goddamn vampires, Otis!
All right, suppose they are.
What can we do about it?
- I think l know a way
we can take 'em out.
- Tell me.
- You gotta uncuff me first.
- Well, you tell me,
and we'll take 'em out.
Get these cuffs off me now!
- Fuck you. Come on, kid.
- Otis!
- Fuck you.
- You take these cuffs off me, Otis!
Otis!
Get these cuffs off me!
No!
All right, let's hear it.
And this better be good.
You ain't hearing nothin'
until you get these cuffs off of me.
Looks like it's
just about over, Otis.
Looks like you might
be right, Luther.
- Take that, you cocksucker.
We'll take care of these pussies.
Get the car loaded up.
l was just gettin' the car ready.
If you weren't already dead,
I'd kill your ass.
- That's for the kid.
Time to come with us, Buck.
- The bite ain't that bad.
- Bite my ass.
This is no time
for long good-byes, asshole.
- Yeah!
- Oh, man!
- Boo!
- Shit!
Otis!
- Fuck, your luck's done
run out, Luther.
Let's get the hell out of here
while we still got some dark left.
You just don't ever give up,
do you, Bucky? l admire that.
- Couldn't just go along
with the program, could you?
- You had to be a hero!
Had to play the old,
tough cowboy, huh?
- You had to fuck everything up,
didn't you?
- What's wrong, tough guy?
Happy trails!
- How you feeling now, Bucky?
- Fuck.
Jesus!
You about gave me
a heart attack, Otis.
Yeah.
Nice shades.
We're the goddamn fearless
vampire killers, ain't we, Otis?
Yeah, too bad there ain't much call
for that kind of work.
Yeah, l don't imagine.
Tell me something, Buck.
What in the hell are vampires
doing robbing a bank?
You got me.
I suppose vampires need money
just like anybody else.
I guess.
Nope.
Gave 'em up.
Use one of those patches?
- No. Cold turkey.
- Goddamn.
- You ever miss 'em?
- Aw...
every once in a while.
After a good, hot cup of coffee...
after a good meal and...
a good, hard fuck...
but... not too often.
Well, I think l might have
to make a run for it, Otis.
l ain't never done too good
locked up in one of them cages.
Spent too much of my life
like that already.
Well, I suppose l ought
to try and stop you.
