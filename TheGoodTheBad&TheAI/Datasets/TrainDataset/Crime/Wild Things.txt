- Did you see his eyes?
- Ohh!
Look at him. Ohh!
Fuck off!
I appreciate
you guys coming down.
The only thing I'm gonna miss
in this dump is--
Settle down.
Well, we've come to the halfway point
of our senior seminar.
Settle down.
- Beats study hall, doesn't it?
- No!
That you, Jimmy?
At least in study hall
I can meditate.
He means masturbate.
Something with which I'm sure you've
had hands-on experience, Kirk.
It wasn't me, man!
I'm innocent!
We've all heard the terms
"date rape", "sexual harassment."
We've discussed some of these issues
right here in this very room.
Our guests today come from
the Blue Bay Police Department.
Detectives Duquette and Perez...
are here to give us what we hope will be
a fresh perspective on the subject...
and to address any questions
that any of you might have.
Let's give them a warm welcome.
- Thank you, Mr. Lombardo.
- I'm outta here.
- Let's begin with a question--
- This prick can kiss my ass.
As I was saying...
why don't we begin
with a question.
What is a sex crime?
Not gettin' any.
Blue Bay, fight, fight!
Buccaneers, win tonight!
Steady.
Steady the bow, Jimmy.
That's good.
Drop the main.
All right, guys, let's de-rig.
I'll see you all Monday.
Buccaneers are number one,
and don't you forget it!
Good work, guys.
See you Monday.
- See you, Mr. Lombardo.
- All right, buddy.
The Buccaneers are number one...
and don't you forget it!
All right! I could definitely
party on one of those.
It's a stinkpot, Jimmy.
You wanna be a real boatman,
you wanna get yourself one of those.
That's a real boat.
Thank you for getting me
into this class.
No way my old man was
gonna spring for the fees.
Hey, you're working for it, and
you're learning your way around a boat.
I put myself through college
working on boats.
- Beats flippin' burgers.
- Yeah.
Can I play too,
or is it just for boys?
So, who's washing your Jeep
this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?
The senior car wash,
remember?
Washing that old Jeep of mine
is a waste of time.
Not at all.
Nicole and I will do it as a team.
I tell you what.
I'm going out to the Glades Saturday.
Come over Sunday
and you can wash all the mud off.
Deal.
I was counting on my mom for a ride,
but she's not here.
Surprise, surprise.
I was wondering
if you could give me one.
Mr. Lombardo, you really wouldn't
want me to walk, would you?
I mean,
something bad might happen.
Jimbo, you need a lift?
Yeah, but I got my bike.
Hey, no problem.
Okay, try it.
Suzie, you need a lift?
- We got room for one more.
- Jesus.
Where'd she get those shoes,
Whores For Less?
Try it again.
Nice to see you kids
gettin' along.
Whoa.
- Don't forget Sunday.
- I won't.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Hi, Mom.
Sam. Hi.
Hi, Sandra.
Why don't you come on in
and have a drink.
Sorry. I gotta run.
Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
Hi, girls.
Look. He forgot.
I knew it.
No, I didn't.
Check out my Jeep.
Nice and dirty for you.
But you might wanna wait
till the other car leaves.
You mean the Mercedes
isn't yours too?
My Benz is blue.
You know that, Nicole.
Sam, I'm leaving.
Where's your hose, Mr. Lombardo?
The hose, Kelly,
is right in front of the Jeep.
Kelly Van Ryan's
gonna wash your Jeep?
It's for a good cause,
Barbara.
Sam the philanthropist.
You know what they say:
A little hard work never hurt anyone.
Okay.
Have fun at the club.
Wow.
Looks brand-new.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Your coupon.
We gotta have it.
Oh, yeah, that thing.
Can't we just--
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Okay, let me look for it.
Mr. Lombardo?
We're running kind of late.
Nicole could go on to the Mansons.
I'll wait till you've found the ticket.
Just give me a minute.
Okay?
- Go.
- Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, Frankie! Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Goddamn it!
Jesus H. Christ!
- What? Huh?
- Oh, nothing.
Come on.
- Art, this is a hell of a fish.
- It's a barracuda.
If you weren't so busy
chasing booty at the yacht club...
you'd have caught one
for yourself.
You're not gonna eat this thing.
Why not?
It's poisonous.
It'll kill you.
Shit, man, I could say that
about most of the girls you date.
Sandra Van Ryan for Sam.
- Sandra, what's up?
Have you heard anything?
Not a word.
Never mind.
I found her.
Pull!
Listen, Sam...
it was really good seeing you
the other day.
Sandra, I'm real busy
right now, so--
I haven't found anyone who can
handle my boat the way you can.
- I know you're fucking Barbara Baxter.
So, maybe I'm a one-woman man now.
You really think you're gonna get one
of these Blue Bay women to marry you?
- Are you finished, Sandra?
You're a hired hand, a good lay.
That's as far as it goes.
Enjoy it, while it lasts.
Good-bye, Sandra.
Pull!
You seem to find guns
therapeutic.
Maybe I oughta try it.
So, let me guess.
Some boy didn't call
and screwed up your whole weekend.
So you're taking the day off.
Right?
Which one of your deck hands
is that?
Whichever one I want.
Okay, Kelly, what's the matter?
What is it?
I miss Dad.
Jesus.
I miss him too, sometimes.
No, you don't.
He didn't have to
kill himself, Kelly.
I don't know
why he did it.
I really don't.
Can I get you anything?
Do you want a Valium?
I was raped.
What, honey?
I couldn't hear you.
I said, I was raped.
What?
I was raped...
by Sam Lombardo.
Sam Lombardo?
does not get raped
in Blue Bay!
You're saying that
Sam Lombardo raped her?
That son of a bitch must be insane
to think he can do this to me.
We understand your feelings,
Mrs. Van Ryan...
but please,
we need some time with Kelly.
We'd like to take
her statement alone.
- Are you all right with this, baby?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Would you like to take a break
for a minute?
I just wanna
get it over with.
We'd like to videotape
this statement.
I know this isn't pleasant, Kelly,
but these are serious charges...
and we need to know everything that
happened between you and Mr. Lombardo.
Are you ready?
He started rubbing my shoulders.
"No little girl can ever
make me come." Jesus.
Too bad. We might have had
some physical evidence.
What?
Maybe there's no physical evidence
because nothing happened.
You want my gut?
I think she's acting.
I think she set it up to be alone
with him so he could come on to her.
She's upset 'cause he didn't.
Maybe she set it up that way.
Maybe not.
The guy should've never had her
out there in the first place.
The line I have on this guy,
he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
That doesn't make him a rapist.
What about asking her
to take a polygraph?
What about asking the pope
to take a piss test?
This is Blue Bay.
Ask a Van Ryan to take a polygraph
and Tom Baxter will cut you down.
You afraid of Tom Baxter?
You afraid of Sandra Van Ryan?
End of discussion.
You both know what to do.
Start with his neighbors, coworkers.
Talk to Kelly's friends.
- You know what that means for Lombardo.
- And you heard Kelly's statement.
The guy's dirty.
Bring me a case.
All right.
Good work, Jimbo.
- I'll see you Monday.
- All right.
He's what's left
of my sailing class.
Talk to me, Artie.
Kelly Van Ryan
is accusing you of rape.
Jimmy told me.
Apparently I'm the last one
to know about it.
Sam, l--
Sandra Van Ryan
has been on the horn all day...
with every member
of the school board.
She's pushing for suspension.
And the board's just gonna roll over for
Sandra Van Ryan without hearing my side?
This is insane.
I'm innocent, goddamn it.
You gotta believe that.
All I can tell you is
hang in there.
They clear you,
you get reinstated--
You never get clear
of something like this.
It stays with you.
It follows you around forever.
You're gonna need some help.
You're gonna need an attorney.
And maybe you can tell me
which attorney in South Florida...
is gonna wanna go up against
the Van Ryans in court.
I'm here to see Ken Bowden.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yeah.
Sam Lombardo.
Okay, then.
Mr. Bowden,
your 10:30's here.
Will you show him in, please?
What brings you
to this part of town?
Well, I was,
until yesterday...
a guidance counselor
at Blue Bay High School.
A student there
is accusing me of rape.
Male or female?
The student is Kelly Van Ryan.
As in Sandra Van Ryan?
As in I'm fucked.
Tell me about it.
Where do I begin?
Start with...
your relationship
with the girl, Kelly.
She's a student.
I was her guidance counselor.
Beyond that,
there was no relationship.
Then don't worry.
- What did you do to your neck?
- This?
I don't have to wear it
all the time.
There was an insurance guy
around here earlier.
All right,
let me tell you how I charge.
Georgie, hey.
We gonna catch some wind?
I'm afraid I can't
park your car today.
You can't park me?
I'm meeting Barbara for lunch.
Can you get this parked, Georgie?
We're running late.
Right away, Mr. Baxter.
You're finished here,
Lombardo.
Take a hike.
Barbara, let's go.
Talk to me.
Maybe you didn't hear me,
Lombardo.
You're finished in Blue Bay.
I find you around my daughter again,
you'll be finished, period.
Get the fuck outta here.
Mr. Lombardo, please.
That's all right, George.
Sam, honey.
Haven't seen you in a while.
- Welcome back.
- Rum and Coke.
Are you all right?
Huh?
- I'm fine.
- Cool?
That's too bad, motherfucker.
Sam?
Lombardo?
Whoa, man!
It's me.
Sorry, man. Things have been
gettin' weird around here.
I can see that.
Come on in.
You're sure this Frankie Condo guy
is the guy who did this to you?
It was him, all right.
He was driving
Sandra's Range Rover.
You tell that to the cops, we can
go after Sandra Van Ryan right now.
Forget it.
The lady has deep pockets.
I know how deep
her pockets are.
I thought I might be able to
save my house. Some sort of equity loan.
Guess who's on the bank's
board of directors?
I don't need any more trouble
from this woman.
You think making some sort
of statement is gonna stop her?
With the shit I got on Kelly?
Yeah.
A year ago...
when her old man
blew his brains out...
Kelly lost it, ran away.
They found her in some fleabag motel
coked out of her gourd.
Meanwhile...
you, Sam, are voted
Educator of the Year...
or some crap.
They put the two of you
in front of a jury...
they're gonna look stupid.
They know it.
Why haven't they taken
your statement yet?
'Cause they're busy
looking for dirt...
they're not gonna find.
Right?
Ken, I don't fuck my students.
He's just showing off
for you now.
Hey there, Ruby.
I see you still got Walter.
I was hopin' something
had eaten him by now.
Can I help you?
Suzie called us.
Where would we find her?
You know the way.
You won't shoot her, will ya?
I don't believe she's armed.
Yeah?
It took you guys long enough.
What if someone
was trying to strangle me...
or fuck me in the ass, even?
You guys do sex crimes,
right?
My partner
Detective Perez.
It's Celine.
He's okay.
He had a pretty good line
on what cheap fucks people are.
You called us.
Remember?
Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?
- Will they?
- I don't know.
That bothers you?
I want to go outside.
When was this that Sam Lombardo
gave you the ride?
About a year ago.
When you arrived at your trailer,
was anyone there?
No.
- So you were alone.
- Yeah.
Did he come in with you?
I guess.
You guess.
Well, did he or didn't he?
Okay.
Yeah, he did.
And then what? Did he touch you?
Did you, maybe, flirt with him?
Suzie, look, I know you feel bad.
Just tell us the truth.
I didn't say a thing to him.
He put his arm around me
and told me I was pretty.
I could be really pretty,
he said.
Did you ask him to stop?
Shit.
What difference does it make?
No one's gonna believe me anyway.
- Did Sam Lombardo rape you?
- Yeah. Okay? He did.
He pushed me to the floor
and did it.
- Now are we done?
- Almost, Suzie.
Almost.
At some point,
were you able to fight him off?
No.
He stopped by himself.
Okay? Is that it?
Leave me alone.
- Don't touch me!
- Take it easy.
He stopped.
And that was it?
He just left?
Yeah.
He did say one thing first.
What was that?
He said, "No little bitch
can ever make me come."
Open the gate.
- Hey, counselor, how about a smoke?
- Hello, Jinxy.
It's really
a bad news-good news situation.
You were denied bail,
but you got a real attorney...
instead of a public defender.
I'm telling you, Ken,
I'm innocent.
You are preachin'
to the choir.
You're not alone.
So you're the new
chicken licker.
Sandra, can we get
your comment?
Can I just have your feelings
at this time?
Mr. Lombardo will get
what he deserves.
Will you tell us anything?
- Are you confident about the case?
- Very.
with its tabloid appeal.
Just arriving,
Sandra Van Ryan...
jet set real estate heiress
and part of the powerful Blue Bay elite.
And the girl from the wrong side
of the tracks.
In the end, the jury must choose between
the words of these 18-year-old girls...
and that of Sam Lombardo.
Reporting live
from the courthouse steps...
I'm Nancy Duerr,
The Honorable Sylvia B. Wexman
presiding. All rise.
We gotta stand up.
Please be seated.
Now sit down.
Would you like more time,
Kelly?
I know that this is hard,
Kelly...
but I have one more question.
Even though it's something
we've been over...
I want us all
to be very clear about it.
When you saw...
that Mr. Lombardo...
intended to have sex with you...
what were your exact words?
What did you say?
I told him "No."
I said,
"Stop, Mr. Lombardo. Please."
I screamed for him to stop.
You screamed for him...
to stop.
And did he?
He raped me on the floor
of his shitty house.
Thank you.
It's day two
of the Lombardo rape case...
and the second alleged young victim
of the former guidance counselor...
Eyewitness News.
Good morning, everybody.
Miss Toller.
When you were...
picked up for shoplifting
your freshman year at Blue Bay...
and you were allowed
to make one call...
you called Mr. Lombardo.
Isn't that correct?
Miss Toller?
Yes.
When you were expelled from Blue Bay
for destruction of school property--
I broke a fucking window.
It wasn't even my fault.
Miss Toller, you will wait until
you are asked before responding...
and you will refrain from
using profanity in this court.
Mr. Lombardo appeared with you
in lieu of a parent conference.
Is that right?
Yes.
It seems to me...
that Mr. Lombardo
was your friend.
He was.
But all that changed when...
according to your testimony...
Mr. Lombardo...
raped you...
on April 23 of last year,
right?
- Yes.
- But then in May...
when you were arrested
for possession of narcotics...
and again allowed a phone call...
you called Mr. Lombardo.
So what?
" So what?"
Oops, Suzie.
So, one month after you say
this man raped you...
you go to him for help?
Sounds as if you still considered
Mr. Lombardo a pretty good friend.
- I needed help.
- I'm sure you did.
But Mr. Lombardo
wasn't there this time.
It was summer,
he was gone...
and you spent six months
in a state correctional facility.
Did that make you mad, Suzie...
that Sam was gone?
That he wasn't there?
Hmm?
Is that the reason you're saying these
things about Mr. Lombardo, your friend?
I said them
because they happened.
Are you gonna sit there,
under oath...
and swear that Samuel Lombardo
raped you?
I said he did.
Let me ask you a question.
Did you enjoy
being a guest of the state?
'Cause I can promise you
if you are lying about Sam Lombardo...
and I believe you are...
you'll be visiting
that facility again quite soon.
Which is why I'll ask again...
under oath...
Suzie...
did Samuel Lombardo rape you?
Miss Toller, you will
have to answer the question.
- Miss Toller.
- Goddamn it!
- This was not my idea.
- Objection, Your Honor.
Miss Toller is clearly responding
to defense counsel's badgering.
Court would like to hear
what Miss Toller has to say.
Miss Toller?
Sam Lombardo didn't rape me.
He didn't rape Kelly either.
He didn't do anything.
This is ridiculous. The witness has been
directly threatened by defense counsel!
I think I made it plain this court
intends to hear Miss Toller's story.
Miss Toller.
I just wanted to hurt
Mr. Lombardo.
He was my friend, at first.
Then I got busted,
and he didn't stick up for me...
and I had to go away
to that hell hole.
It's like you're his favorite,
then "Who cares?"
Make her stop.
When Kelly said we should do this,
I thought, "Cool."
All these big shots screwing me over,
like that cop Duquette.
Now they're screwed.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I have to object.
Your Honor, please,
may I be heard?
Mr. Baxter,
you are not trying this case.
Sit down.
Kelly's pissed
at Mr. Lombardo too.
She's in love with him.
He's been her fantasy
since her old man died.
Then she found out Mr. Lombardo
was doing her mom, and that was it.
What? Kelly!
You skanky bitch!
Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you know who I am?
Just get the hell
away from me.
Jesus, man! Let loose!
I'm just thinking about
where I'm gonna stay.
I lost my house.
Wakin' up from
a goddamn nightmare.
You'll get over it.
We have got a knock-down,
airtight, motherfucker lawsuit...
against Sandra Van Ryan.
Just like that?
These people
ruined your life, bro.
I told you
they'd go too far.
They went overboard!
They did!
They'll settle.
Believe me.
They'll be begging to settle.
Oh, yeah! Here we go!
Wait up! Come on, girl.
Excuse me. Over here.
Excuse me.
Can anybody read?
Hey! Sandra!
I want you to nail that shyster's balls
to the nearest wall.
That might've been
a possibility...
if Miss Not-So Bright
hadn't started throwing things.
Fuck off.
I cannot believe you're gonna
let them get away with this shit...
all on the word of
one little white-trash bitch.
I don't think
you get it, Sandy.
Your princess here
committed perjury.
It'll be all I can do to keep
her fuckin' little ass out of jail.
What are we going to do?
- Here's your coffee, Sam.
- Thank you.
Ken.
Sorry I'm late.
Hold my calls, Lenore.
Okay, Mr. Bowden.
Thank you, Sandra.
I'll be seeing you.
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.
Nice to see you, Tom.
Come by.
We'll have lunch.
See you at the club.
See you at the club.
See you at the club, Tommy!
Hey, Tom.
What'd you shoot today, pal?
Hey, my man!
This is for you.
- You did good, Ken.
- Thanks.
I know there's a part of you
that wishes none of this had happened...
but it did, so take the money
and enjoy yourself.
All right?
Find a happy place.
Lenore, would you see
Mr. Lombardo out, please?
- Good-bye, Sam.
- Bye, Lenore.
Take care of my lizards, huh?
Hello, Kelly.
Drop dead.
You know how my mom's paying you off?
She's breaking my trust.
I can't touch it until she's dead,
and now she's breaking it to pay you.
I'm sorry, Kelly.
Why don't you start fucking her again!
You can spend it together!
I fucking hate you,
you son of a bitch!
I fucking hate you!
You see, Art? I couldn't come back
even if I wanted to.
Goddamn maid.
So you got my mom's money.
How much?
How much?
You know how much.
Your turn to pay.
It worked!
We screwed the bitch!
It worked
just like you said.
What's wrong?
You scared the shit out of me.
Your coming here.
That's what's wrong.
Are you fuckin' crazy?
Yeah, I'm crazy.
Ask my mom.
So, how much is eight-and-a-half
million divided by three?
Oh, great.
Everyone thinks
this is really funny.
Do you think
this is fuckin' over?
Let me tell you something.
It's a long fuckin' way from over.
I'm serious.
After tonight the three of us
are not to be seen together again.
After tonight?
Yeah, well,
we're here, aren't we?
So maybe one celebration
is okay...
if we're in agreement...
that from here on out...
you do exactly as I say.
Guidance counselors get to find out
all sorts of interesting things.
Now I want you two to kiss.
Come on now.
Never let the sun go down
on an argument.
I told you they were
gonna make us look stupid.
You're right.
They did make us look stupid.
What you're wrong about is why.
Hear me out.
Lombardo was havin' an affair
with Sandra Van Ryan.
Why not tell us about it?
That's a hell of a motive
for Kelly to fabricate this story.
Maybe Lombardo's attorney
was saving the affair for the trial.
I thought about that, then said:
You're Lombardo. Your life is trashed.
You don't wanna sit in jail
for three months unless--
Unless what?
Unless you're setting
Sandra Van Ryan up for the big payday.
Lombardo was eyeball-deep in debt
before this whole thing started...
tryin' to keep up with a pricey
piece of trim like Barbara Baxter.
Lombardo may be broke,
but why would Kelly steal?
The kid's got money from her grandfather
she can't touch until her mother dies.
I'm tellin' you, this guy...
wanted to marry money.
Nice stroke.
- Is there some reason why you're here?
- Curiosity, I guess.
About what?
How to improve your breast stroke?
I was curious about how you see things
workin' out for you and Sam and Suzie.
Excuse me?
You three are gonna go to the Caribbean
together and live happily ever after?
The thing about it is that
threesomes rarely work out.
You're out of your mind.
It's hard enough for one person
to keep a secret, let alone three.
Especially when
two of 'em are in love.
You and Sam don't want that pill-head
around now that you have the money.
Am I right?
Sam sell you on the idea right up front
of whackin' Suzie?
That's murder, kid.
Police.
God, get a life.
You're good.
But you don't think that little freak
Suzie's gonna hold up, do you?
Hello.
You better watch it
with that shit.
You get busted again,
you go back in a two-time loser.
Yeah, or wind up dead.
You know...
I don't think I ever told you
how sorry I was about your friend.
What was his name?
Help me out here, Suzie.
You know his name.
- Davy.
- Yeah.
That's right. Davy.
I was really sorry about
the way that worked out.
- That is cop bullshit.
- What was that?
I don't have to listen to this,
and you can't shove me around.
I have friends now.
This is Ray, Suzie.
You don't have shit!
You never had shit
and you never will have shit.
Take a look at this.
Go ahead.
It's not gonna bite you.
Take it!
Your friend Sam
deposited the check.
He transferred the funds to
an offshore account. A numbered account.
Cops don't even know whose name's on it.
Think one of them's yours?
He put a down payment on island property
and a lease-to-buy on a sailboat.
You're into sailing, aren't you?
I don't know why you're telling me this.
Why are you here?
I'm telling you this because
I know exactly what's goin' on.
Two's company.
Three's a crowd.
Come on, now.
You don't think Kelly and Sam are gonna
share that money with you, do you?
Leave me alone.
You know, I'd want a clear head
right now if I were you...
so I could keep a real close eye
on my new friends.
I'd hate to see you
come to a bad end...
like Davy.
Shit.
I can't believe you called Sam.
What's the matter with you?
I'm scared
there's no one to trust.
You can trust me.
Hello?
- Yeah.
She left this insane message.
Between whatever she's
been smoking out there...
and this fucking cop, Duquette,
she's gonna blow it.
Why can't you come? Please?
Sam, I miss you so much.
I miss you too, Kelly,
but I can't right now.
We gotta stick to the plan, okay?
- Then what?
But I need you, Kelly.
I need you to be there for me tonight.
- Okay.
That's my girl.
You're the strong one, you know?
Now, since the settlement,
people think I'm rich...
so I'm out there spendin' money,
doin' what rich guys do.
- That's easy for you to say.
The only people who
can fuck this up is us.
You-- You are gonna
fuck me over, aren't you?
Oh, for chrissake.
You are!
Are you retarded, or just brain-dead
from whiffin' fumes out in the swamp?
That's what I am to you--
swamp trash...
just like my mom.
Don't!
You stupid cunt!
You are scared, aren't you?
Jesus Christ!
- Are you crazy?
- Hear her say "Sam"?
That was Lombardo on the phone.
And you saw the two girls.
The conversation on that tape
is unintelligible.
What we have here is you
on the Van Ryan property...
- shooting a porn flick!
- I can't believe this.
A month ago these two were
throwing things at each other in court.
They were acting!
They were all acting!
We bought it,
hook, line and sinker.
Now they're gettin' away with
$8 million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
Which she might have saved if she hadn't
set out to destroy the man's life.
You wouldn't go after a guy
that you thought raped your daughter?
She bought the same
goddamn story we did!
Both of you, you're not on a case,
because there is no fucking case!
I've had it with Sandra Van Ryan,
and you keep muckin' around like this...
and she's gonna be suing us
for invasion of privacy.
So get out of
these people's lives!
- Am I gettin' through?
- You think this is just about money?
About us lookin' stupid?
Question him.
You'll find a manipulative psychopath,
and those girls will wind up dead.
Give this idiot
somethin' to do.
- Let him look into the Kennedy murder.
- I understand.
Next time this
fucking piece of shit...
drags me down here,
I'm gonna sue you.
You're goddamn lucky
I didn't sue you last time.
- I agree.
- Am I free to go?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- Cocksucker.
- What was that?
- You heard me, motherfucker.
- You wanna say that to my face?
What are you lookin' at?
- I guess I kind of lost it out there.
- You could say that.
Have you ever seen something coming,
and didn't do what you could to stop it?
We all have.
I mean somethin' bad that you
saw coming, and then it happened...
and you didn't do anything and--
I did that once.
I don't wanna do it again.
I thought we were
goin' to a movie.
I think we just
need to get wasted.
Come on.
I wanna live
at the beach someday.
Oh, shit.
I left the keys.
I'll get them.
Kelly?
Suzie.
It's me.
I was worried about you,
and I decided...
that the three of us should get together
one last time before we split up.
Are you mad at me?
I probably should've
told you a bit more about...
the part I intended to play.
But we'll go through it
again tonight.
This is a celebration,
not a suicide pact.
We're gonna chill out
and just relax...
have a little champagne...
watch the stars.
Have you got a blanket
in the back of your mom's Rover?
Why don't you be an angel,
and run over and get it for us?
Good girl.
Let me tell you about
this boat I got picked out for us.
You okay?
My mom would kill me
if she knew I took the Rover.
You say she didn't
come home last night.
She's been talkin' about goin' to L.A.,
but her clothes are all still here.
Walter! You get sick,
it'll serve you right.
Found some teeth
in an old trailer down the road.
He says they'll fit.
Suzie hasn't been back to school
since the trial.
Oh, now they're sayin'
that she can't graduate.
Kelly Van Ryan got her into
this whole mess, and you know it.
We'll look into it for you, Ruby.
We find somethin',
you'll be the first to know.
Come on.
It's starting, Gloria.
This is how it begins.
We don't know anything yet.
She could be anywhere.
I'll drop you off at the office.
Put a call out on Suzie's car.
You got someplace you wanna be?
You got a date?
Just check the car out for me.
It's over here
by that old boat.
So you and Suzie used to
come out here together?
Yeah, sometimes.
A lot of the kids hang out here.
You really think
somethin' bad happened to Suzie?
Lombardo ever come out here?
I say somethin' funny?
No, but I mean,
just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would--
Well, the way I heard it,
he was pretty tight with the kids.
You and him were pals, right?
Yeah, but he got me
on the sailing team.
Told me I could work my way
through college, like he did.
Told me I could work my way
through college, like he did.
Lombardo went to the University of Miami
on an athletic scholarship.
Boats didn't have
a damn thing to do with it.
I'm gonna be here a while, kid.
Why don't you go up to the highway
and catch the bus?
Hey, Jimmy.
People aren't always what
they appear to be. Don't forget that.
- This is where they did it.
- Where's the body?
The swamp, most likely.
The guy's a swamp rat.
He knows it'll never be found,
but he made one mistake.
The grandmother said she'd been
threatening to run away...
and I found the car
at the bus terminal.
- You don't think Sam put it there?
- Hold on a second.
Gloria, then have the car
dusted for prints.
And if Suzie even was murdered,
it was that damn Van Ryan kid.
Little sociopath's the one
who started this in the first place.
- How long before we get somethin'?
- We can get blood type right away.
Dental records will take longer.
DNA could take weeks.
Poor dumb Suzie.
Never had a chance.
- We don't know that.
- I'm tellin' you, Kelly's next.
I'm tellin' you,
you get out of this... right now.
Don't even fuckin' let me
hear about you bothering Lombardo.
David, you get an I.D.,
you call me!
- Will you do me one favor?
- Ray, you heard him.
He told me to stay away from Lombardo.
He didn't say anything about you.
What if I'm right
and Hunter's wrong?
Please, you gotta
help me out.
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's,
you'll give this up?
If I'm wrong about those teeth,
you got my word.
- Hello?
- I wanna see you.
- Stupid guest house.
I'm really nervous.
Kelly, relax.
Take one of your mom's
Valiums or something.
In a week, you get on the plane,
this is over. We're rich.
But what if they find out?
My God, they'd put you
in the electric chair.
stay in the guest house tonight,
skip the graduation parties.
I love you so much.
Peeping in people's windows.
Isn't that against the law?
Suzie Toller's missing.
- Since when?
- She didn't come home last night.
We found her car
at the bus terminal.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
I don't know what to tell you.
You could tell me
where you were last night.
I suppose I could,
but I don't really have to, now do I?
Come here.
I wanna show you something.
Looks like good-bye.
Kelly's file.
Read it.
You're gonna find an angry,
sexually confused girl...
who threatened the lives
of at least two people.
What two people?
One of them was her mother.
The other one was a...
a female classmate...
she may have been
sexually involved with.
Suzie?
Now you got the file.
Read it.
I think it'll give you
a new perspective on things.
Why didn't you tell us about this
before the trial?
Because then I had principles...
that meant a lot to me.
Now...
I don't care.
I should probably go now.
Unless you're planning
on holding me for something.
- Duquette. What's happening?
- Where's Lombardo?
Gloria, the blood type
on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Let me tell you somethin', Ray.
There's more to this story
than you know.
Hunter may be on
the right track about Kelly.
Shit, Ray.
- It's Detective Duquette.
Open the gate now.
- Hello, Kelly.
- What are you doin' here?
Where's-- Kelly!
I just looked away for a second,
just a split second.
And just like that-- bingo--
she put a knee in my groin.
I didn't go down,
but it slowed me down...
just enough.
I couldn't get to her.
She turned on me with the gun.
Fired one shot.
I took the hit in the shoulder.
I had no choice.
I had to return fire.
Two rounds, I think,
in the chest.
I went there to protect her.
I went there to protect her.
Detective Duquette...
Detective Duquette...
I spent some time in military
intelligence, and we had a saying there:
Once is happenstance.
Twice is coincidence.
Three times is enemy action.
This is twice for you,
Duquette...
and I intend to see to it
that there is no third time.
Our investigation finds that this was
a good shooting, but that's irrelevant.
You ignored the advice
of your superiors.
Consequently,
two young women are dead.
You are, as of now, terminated,
with forfeiture of pension and benefits.
Chief Goodsall...
Detective Duquette found
Susan Marie Toller's teeth and blood...
near the area
known as Stoner Beach.
Miss Toller's blood was also found
in the Van Ryan Range Rover.
This has led
this office to conclude...
that Susan Marie Toller
was murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan.
Oh, she didn't.
She didn't.
Mr. Duquette.
This investigation is concluded.
You're dismissed.
Thank you.
Howdy, partner.
Jesus, man. I wasn't
expecting you until tomorrow.
Hey, nice girlfriend
you got there.
Kelly was only
supposed to be framed.
The bitch shot me.
Shit, you're a cop.
Don't they teach you to disarm people?
You know, shoot them
in the leg or somethin'?
Did you become squeamish about
this stuff before or after...
you bludgeoned little Suzie
to death with a wine bottle?
Kelly wasn't supposed to die, Ray.
It wasn't part of the plan.
Man, it couldn't have worked out better.
They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie.
I couldn't talk them out of it.
What I'm telling you is,
I don't like surprises.
Look at it this way:
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Now there's no loose ends.
Come tomorrow,
you'll never see me again.
Oh, listen, about tomorrow.
I spoke to the bank and they said
it's gonna take two working days...
to make the--
make the transfer, so--
Bullshit.
Call them yourself.
Anyway, what's your hurry?
Kick back for a day or two.
We'll take out the boat.
I just had it outfitted.
I could use a deck hand.
Here's to large bank accounts.
You gotta lighten up, partner.
You're a rich man.
To large accounts
and no loose ends.
And no loose ends.
Hey, Ray,
see that winch?
Take a couple turns on it.
She's luffing.
- You mean that thing?
- Yeah.
We call it a winch.
It's what we use to tighten the sails.
- So why don't you start cranking?
- This is supposed to be a vacation.
Why don't you get
a nice powerboat?
Come on, Ray.
I'll make a sailor outta you yet.
Or get me drowned.
It's stuck.
What do you mean?
Put a little elbow grease in it.
It's stuck, I'm tellin' you.
The jenny sheet
must be caught on something.
Why don't you go starboard
and see if you can unhook it?
- I don't understand a word you said.
- Okay, Ray.
You see this line right here?
Follow it down...
and see if you can see
what it's snagged on.
You're killin' me.
This thing?
That's it. That one right there.
You see anything?
Look a little lower.
That's it.
Guess I forgot to tell you, Ray.
One hand for the boat,
the other one for yourself.
First rule of sailing.
- Ray, what happened?
- Nice try, motherfucker!
You!
- You're dead!
- No, I'm not.
For chrissake!
Sorry, partner.
You really shouldn't have killed Kelly.
You shouldn't have killed
that kid out in the Glades, either.
What was his name?
Davy.
That's my son Walter.
He's been doin' this a long time,
so don't you be afraid.
Please, come on in.
Thank you so much for
comin' down to the Glades.
Did you come out here to watch Walter,
or is this an official visit?
No. Actually,
it's my day off.
I thought you looked different.
I came over here because
I was hoping you would talk to me.
About Suzie?
Actually, I was wondering if you would
talk to me about Ray Duquette.
He used to come around here.
He had a thing goin'
with one of the girls--
" girls"-- over at the Glades.
Got sort of hung up on her,
from what I hear.
- She still work there?
- Not after that night.
All I know is,
the next mornin'...
she was gone
and a boy was dead.
Seminole kid named Davy.
He had a crush on Ray's whore.
Caught Ray slappin' her around,
and he tried to stop it.
So Ray killed him.
Suzie saw it.
So he busted her
and sent her up.
You know,
just to prove that he could.
That's all there is to say
about Ray Duquette.
To Ray.
We won.
Sam, it's over.
Talk about paranoid.
Take a look around us, Sam.
You're gonna have to teach me how to
drive this before I can get rid of you.
Okay, Toller.
I wanna trim the sail.
Grab a hold of that winch.
Fuck the winch.
I wanna drive.
It doesn't work that way.
You don't drive it, you sail it.
Now get on that winch.
I just wanna cruise for a while.
That's funny.
That's one of the first things
I noticed about you, Sam.
You like to cruise.
Suzie--
Take college, for instance.
I bet the classes you took were the ones
where the finals were multiple choice.
And you never bought the book.
You'd always find some girl...
to loan you hers, and then you'd
have to fuck her after that, right?
Is that how it went?
Yeah.
Well, I've got
a good pop quiz for you.
Multiple choice, of course.
Before sailing away on the  Medea
killed King Creon and the princess...
with what?
A rock...
a spear gun, or...
a little poison?
Poison!
Good guess.
Nice truck.
Sellin' your boat?
This was Suzie's boat.
Guess she won't be
needin' it now.
Funny.
I wouldn't have guessed
Suzie was a sailor.
Old lady had her tested once.
They said her I.Q.
was way up there...
around 200 or some such shit.
That girl could do just about
anything she put her mind to.
You know...
that weekend I got busted,
I called you about a hundred times.
I really believed that stuff
about you being my friend.
Was I naive.
I can't decide
what came out better:
that little straw up Kelly's nose
or that dog collar around your neck.
What do you think,
Mr. Lombardo?
Seems to like
the same places you do.
Funny you never met.
Yeah, real funny.
You know, you're wrong about this.
And I could get busted on the spot.
The guy's dirty.
He'll love it.
Especially the part
about killing me.
Now get outta here.
Go make yourself a new friend.
What are you drinkin'?
You've got the pressure too tight.
You're gonna crush the fucking evidence.
Oh, for chrissake.
- Hello, Kelly.
- What are you doin' here?
May I ask you a question,
Miss Toller?
Did you enjoy being
a guest of the state?
I hope I never make you mad.
Cash is just
walkin'-around money.
The check is the balance
of the numbered account...
minus the million we set aside for
Ruby and Walter, less my usual fee.
Case closed.
Suzie...
be good.
