NICK: When I think
of my wife...
...I always think
of her head.
I picture cracking
her lovely skull...
The primal questions
of any marriage.
"What have we done
to each other?"
The Irish prince graces us
with his presence.
His majesty prefers
not to be moistened.
I got you a present.
Oh.
I hated this game.
You loved it.
You loved it.
Thank you.
I'll add
it to the collection.
Can you pour
me a bourbon?
What's up, Jitters?
Well, if you're
not going to talk...
I'm gonna have to
fill the silence...
with another excruciating
story by Margo Dunne.
I could tell you about my recent
customer service experience...
changing Internet service providers.
I like that one.
Or how about the time...
I saw that woman
who looked exactly
like my friend Monica?
But it wasn't Monica.
it was a total stranger.
Who was also
named Monica.
Made it kind of interesting.
It's great.
I'm just having a bad day.
Amy?
It's our anniversary.
Five years.
Five?
That came fast.
And furious.
AMY: I'm so crazy,
stupid happy.
A great, sweet, gorgeous,
cool-ass guy.
Excuse me, miss?
I just want you
to be careful...
where you put down
that monk-brewed
Belgian wheat beer...
because the party's down to three
Beast Lights and a bottle of Pucker.
It might attract some
desperate characters.
It could.
I mean, the Amish
are on a Rumspringa.
They already relieved me
of my artisanal meat platter.
Finally, someone tells me
how to pronounce that word.
"Meat"?
Yes, "meat."
One syllable.
Thank you.
Whose beer
am I about to drink?
Don't tell me.
Let's see,
who's your type?
I don't see you
sitting quietly...
while he bloviates on his
postgrad thesis about Proust.
Uh-oh. Is that him?
Ironic hipster,
so self-aware,
he makes
everything a joke.
I prefer men who are
funny, not "funny."
What type are you?
Corn-fed,
salt-of-the-earth
Missouri guy.
Missouri?
Mmm-hmm.
Cute.
Hmm.
Native New Yorker?
The world ends
at the Hudson.
What's your name?
Amy.
Well, Amy,
who are you?
A, I'm an award-winning
scrimshander.
B, I'm a moderately
influential warlord.
Hmm.
C, I write personality
quizzes for magazines.
Okay. Your hands
are far too delicate
for real scrimshaw work...
and I happen to be
a charter subscriber
to  Warlord Weekly...
so I'd recognize you.
I'm gonna go with
And you?
Who are you?
I'm the guy to save you
from all this awesomeness.
Oh, so, you write for
a men's magazine.
God, does that make you
an expert on being a man?
No.
It's what to wear,
what to drink.
How to bullshit.
Never with you.
Ha, ha.
No, I mean it.
It's hard to believe you. Why?
I think it's your chin.
My chin?
Yeah,
it's quite villainous.
Okay, how's this?
A hundred percent true,
no bullshit.
Okay-
NICK: We  move
to New York...
and we end up living in
these little cubby holes,
and that's not it.
Come outside.
Then, you're in it.
You have to see this.
Hey-
I have to kiss you now.
Is that right?
I can't let you go through a
sugar storm unkissed. Hmm.
Oh. Wait a second.
There you go.
Nick Dunne...
I really like you.
So, is Amy gonna do one
of those anniversary...
treasure hunts?
You mean the forced march
designed to prove...
what an oblivious
and uncaring asshole
her husband is?
Wow.
Life. I don't
remember the point.
Deep Hasbro thoughts.
Spin.
What was the clue last year
she got so mad about?
"When your poor
Amy has a cold...
"this dessert
just must be sold."
The answer?
I still don't know
the answer, Go.
GO: A few years ago,
you'd have known.
NICK: A few years ago,
it was fun.
Year one, the traditional
gift was paper.
She got me
a beautiful notebook.
Told me to go
write my novel.
What did you get her?
A kite.
Hmm.
She'd never flown a kite.
Okay.
NICK: Anyway.
Year four, flowers.
She led me outside
to the dying rosebush
in the backyard.
Ugh, that's symbolic.
Yeah.
What's the gift for five?
Wood.
So, what did you get her?
There's no good gift
for wood.
I know! Go home,
fuck her brains out,
slap her with your penis.
"There's some wood
for you, bitch."
The Bar.
Why, yes.
Hang on one second.
Hey, it's Watchful Wally.
Hey, Walt.
What's going on?
Oh.
Thanks very much.
I'll be right there.
All right, bye-bye.
Hey, buddy.
What are you
doing out here?
Thanks, Walt!
Ame?
NICK:  Amy!
Hello?
Come on in.
Hey-
Mister Dunne.
Hi.
I'm Detective Rhonda Boney.
This is Officer James Gilpin.
We understand there are
concerns about your wife.
I don't know
where my wife is.
And I came home to this.
Now, I don't
panic easily...
but it's weird, right?
Mind if we look around?
Please.
BONEY: How long have
you two been here?
Two years in September.
We used to live in New York.
City?
Yeah, I was a writer.
We were both writers.
Why did you all
move back here?
My mom got sick.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How is she?
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
What do you
do now, for work?
My sister Margo and I
own The Bar downtown.
Oh, The Bar.
Love the name.
Very meta.
Thanks.
Pretty things.
Stay.
My office, here.
Beautiful dress.
Date night?
It's our anniversary.
Hmm.
NICK: It's a guest
bedroom, there.
Cat's room on the end.
I checked up here.
This is the kitchen...
obviously.
This is my wife's office.
Amy's office.
BONEY: Wow.
Impressive gal.
Yeah.
Should I be concerned?
I remember these.
I loved these books.
Wait a minute.
Your wife is Amazing Amy?
Yeah. She is.
Wow.
AMY: Amazing-fucking-Amy
is getting fucking married.
With me, regular,
flawed, real Amy,
jealous, as always,
of the golden child.
Perfect, brilliant,
Amazing Amy,
who's getting
fucking married.
When I was 10,
I quit cello.
In the next book, Amazing
Amy became a prodigy.
Did you play volleyball?
AMY: I got cut,
freshman year.
She made varsity.
When did you have a dog?
She got the dog.
Puddles made her
more relatable.
Wow.
I love your parents...
but they really
can be assholes.
RAND: Nick!
Sir!
Hey, thanks for coming, man.
No problem.
Hey, sweetheart.
Big night for your mom.
It would mean so much if you
would talk to a few reporters...
bloggers, give them
a little Amy color.
People wanna
hear from you.
We can't stay long.
Fantastic.
Fifteen minutes, tops.
This is why
I have my brownstone.
My trust fund.
I know I can't complain.
Your parents literally
plagiarized your childhood.
No, they improved upon it...
and then peddled it
to the masses.
I thought you were
gonna wear white to match
the wedding theme.
I thought that
would be creepy.
"if it's worth doing,
it's worth doing..."
Hold up!
I know how this ends.
Don't tell me.
You're very cute, Nick.
Amy, you know
what would
make Dad's night.
Oh, I'm on it.
I love having strangers
pick at my scabs.
FEMALE REPORTER:
I'm curious whether...
it's difficult for you to see
Amazing Amy heading down the aisle.
And this big party
celebrating this
fictional wedding.
Because it's my understanding
you are not married.
Is that correct?
Correct.
Amazing Amy has always
been one step ahead of me.
Excuse me. I'm sorry,
I just have a few questions.
It's you.
I'm here in a strictly
journalistic capacity.
Now, you had
the distinct pleasure...
of dating Nick Dunne
for how long?
Two magical years.
In the course of that time,
you've had the opportunity...
to perform such
gracious gestures as...
not correcting Nick when he
pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."
An understandable mistake.
He also thought
it was a fish.
He thinks
Velveeta is a cheese.
You also manage to appear
shocked and delighted...
when Nick's elderly mother breaks
into an impromptu rendition...
of New York, New York,
every time she sees you.
These bag of bone shoes
That's just frightening.
You also bought Nick his
very first pair of scissors.
And matching stapler.
Amy Elliott, you are
more than amazing.
You are brilliant,
yet entirely un-snobby.
You challenge me.
You surprise me.
And, fun fact
for the readers...
you have a
world-class vagina.
My colleagues tell me
that you are not yet married.
Is that correct?
I'm not.
Isn't it time
we fixed that?
AMY: And then...
the night wasn't
so bad anymore.
And it's done.
Crossed off the list.
Now, normally,
we would not treat this...
as a missing persons
case so quick...
but given the scene
at your house...
and given our spike
in violent crime of late...
we are gonna take this
very, very seriously.
Okay. Good.
We've got forensics
over at your place.
You got somewhere to stay?
I could stay at my sister's.
Okay.
We're tracking Amy's phone,
her credit cards.
We will organize searches,
put up flyers.
We're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.
You're having
a press conference?
I wanna get
the word out, right?
Yeah, it's just
all of a sudden...
I feel like I'm on
a Law &  episode.
Time is of the essence
in these cases.
But, that said,
do you wanna
wait and call a lawyer?
Absolutely not.
I just wanna help.
So, you and Amy
have been here two years.
You tend bar...
I own The Bar.
And I teach
creative writing at MVCC.
No kids?
Not yet.
So, what does Amy
do most days?
A woman with
all those degrees,
what does she do?
I don't know.
She keeps busy.
Doing what?
She's a voracious reader.
So, she's always got
a book in her hand.
Well, days can get long.
I know a few housewives,
that evening glass of wine
starts coming at noon.
Or prescription pills.
GILPIN: Just last week,
we had a soccer mom.
Nice lady.
Got her teeth kicked in
over some OxyContin.
Ever since that
mall went bust,
half the town is out of work.
We cannot keep up
with the drug violence.
I'm pretty sure
that's not it.
Has Amy got friends
we can talk to?
Um...
No, not really.
No friends?
This whole town?
She was very close with my
mom, before she passed away.
You know, we have a pretty
serious homeless problem...
in our neighborhood.
I think maybe you guys
should check that out.
We'll look into that.
You got to The Bar
around 11:00 today.
Where were you before that?
Just to cross that out.
Well, I was home.
I left at 9:30,
I got a cup of coffee,
a newspaper.
I went to Sawyer Beach
and read the news.
Did you visit
with anyone there?
I kind of go to Sawyer Beach
for the solitude.
So, your wife has
no friends here.
Is she kinda standoffish?
Ivy League?
Rubs people the wrong way?
She's from New York.
Oh.
She's complicated.
She's got
very high standards.
Type A?
That can make you crazy
if you're not like that.
You seem pretty laid-back.
Type B.
Speaking of which,
Amy's blood type?
God, I don't know. I'd have
to look it up at the house.
You don't know
if she has friends...
you don't know what
she does all day...
and you don't know
your wife's blood type.
Sure you all are married?
Uh... Maybe it's type O.
Where are her folks?
New York?
Yeah.
Can they get here time for this
press conference tomorrow?
Tomorrow? I have no idea.
I haven't talked to them.
You haven't called
your wife's parents yet?
You can't get a signal
in this building.
I've been in here
talking to you.
Call them,
please, Nick. Now.
Fine.
Should I know
my wife's blood type?
No.
I apologize, Marybeth.
I didn't know
what was going on.
Now I'm at the station...
and the cops
are at the house,
and it's serious
and I'm calling you.
There's a lot of things that
are being juggled right now.
I'm standing right next to
Detective Rhonda Boney...
who's the lead investigator
on this and she's...
My mother-in-law would
like to speak with you.
This is Detective Boney.
BILL: I wanna go home.
I don't know why
I have to be here.
I don't wanna be here.
I wanna go home.
Dad?
This is my father.
What's going on?
Really?
You're Nick Dunne?
We've been trying to get a
hold of you all afternoon.
I've been right there.
My wife is missing.
Bitch.
Don't.
Your father wandered out of
Comfort Hill after lunch.
We found him walking
Route 79, disoriented.
We've been trying to
call you for the last...
I don't get a cell signal
in this building.
I've been sitting
Sir, please don't take
that tone with me.
Stupid, dumb,
ugly bitch.
Dad, stop.
You wanna drive him home?
I think that would be wise.
Thanks.
AUTOMATED VOICE: This voice
mailbox is currently full.
Fuck.
Oh, get your
fucking hands off me.
NICK: Thanks.
AMY: Everyone told us
and told us and told us...
And compromise
and more work.
"Abandon all hope,
ye who enter."
"When young Amy's
hope did wane...
"she wandered here..."
AMY: Well, it's not true.
Not for me and Nick.
"...in search of Jane."
Austen. Hmm.
You were an alienated teen
and only Elizabeth Bennet
understood you.
Look at that.
My God.
You naughty minx.
Well, technically, we are supposed
to fuck at the next stop.
Yeah, in keeping
with tradition.
But I might be willing
to bend the rules this once.
God bless Jane Austen.
I'm enthusiastic.
Look at that.
It's confirmed by the...
Oh, thank you.
Year two. Cotton.
We had that joke that our sex
was too good for ordinary.
So, these are
We're so cute.
I wanna punch us
in the face.
That's pretty great.
I mean, that is pretty great.
GO: Did they ask if
you wanted a lawyer?
I don't need a lawyer.
Here, I'll do this.
Well, did they ask
personal stuff about Amy?
You know, they asked...
why didn't she have any friends?
What did you say?
I said she was complicated.
Nick!
Everyone knows "complicated" is
code for "bitch."
Oh, God.
I feel sick.
Thanks.
It's so bizarre.
It seems like the kind of thing
that would happen to Amy.
She always attracts...
Drama?
You can say it.
It's just me and you.
Just because
I don't like to
be around Amy...
doesn't mean
I don't care about her.
Anyway, whoever took her
is bound to bring her back.
NOELLE: Detective?
Excuse me.
I'm Noelle Hawthorne.
I'm Amy's best friend.
Well, great.
Where do you live, Noelle?
Five doors down. 1032.
Wonderful. I would
love to talk to you.
Can I come by
in half an hour?
Y'all know anything yet?
I'm sorry.
I got guys on
the clock in here.
But you give me 30 minutes.
But that's usually
bath time.
Well, we'll talk
in between shampoos.
All right.
So, what do you got?
It was definitely blood spatter
you saw in the kitchen.
Normally, kitchen,
knives, food prep.
Not that weird,
but that is awfully high.
So, I'm gonna order
a luminol sweep.
Well, okay.
Mmm, interesting.
What's that?
House is rented in her name.
Car's in her name.
Credit cards, utilities,
phone bill, all in her name.
Even his bar's in her name.
I don't know that
that's so surprising.
No. But it is humiliating.
What you got?
It's with
her unmentionables.
Well, we have
our first clue.
I have to take a shower.
No, don't.
You've been up all night.
You wanna look like you've
been up all night.
Hey, be careful today, okay?
That's a weird thing to say.
Well, when you're upset,
you bottle up.
You can seem angry, like...
Please don't say,
"Like Dad."
Or else you swing into your
momma's-boy charm offensive...
and that can feel glib.
Perfect.
I'll balance on the exact fucking
edge of your emotional razor.
Okay. Just be...
Myself?
MAN:
...sponsoring a
4H...
and raffling season tickets
for Mizzou football.
Buy your tickets
at the Wing Hut or local
Tri-State Tire stores.
Your in-laws made it.
Hi, Rand.
Hey, man.
I'm Detective Boney.
I'm the twin. Margo.
We played tennis
yesterday, Nick.
I just can't get over it.
Marybeth,
I am really sorry.
I knew you never should
have moved back here.
We didn't have
a lot of choice.
We are all worried.
We are all scared.
But we are all here now.
And we will find
Amy, together.
Should I just go first, and then
you guys can say something?
Good.
As you know, my wife,
Amy Elliott Dunne...
disappeared from our home
on the morning of July 5th...
under suspicious
circumstances.
MALE REPORTER:
Louder!
If anyone out there, uh,
has any information...
please come forward.
Thank you.
I'm Rand Elliott.
My wife, Marybeth Elliott.
Should I have
said my name?
RAND: Amy is our only child.
She's bright, she's beautiful.
She's kind.
She really is Amazing Amy.
You know, there are millions
of people out there...
who grew up with her
and care about her.
We care about her,
we love her.
And we just
want her back.
Amy is a decorated scholar.
She forged a successful
career in journalism.
She returned here to
her husband's hometown...
and she made a life
in her adopted home.
Now, Amy needs your help.
We're establishing a volunteer
headquarters at the Drury Lodge.
We have a hotline,
And our website is
wvvw.FindAmazingAmy.com.
FEMALE REPORTER: Mr. Dunne!
MALE REPORTER: Mr. Elliott!
FEMALE REPORTER: Mr. Dunne,
any signs of foul play?
Mr. Elliott, when was the last
time you spoke to your daughter?
MALE REPORTER: Smile.
That's all for now.
Thank you.
RAND: Amy is the kind of girl
who attracts admirers.
Right, Nick?
Yeah, definitely.
And we've had instances...
where things got...
Scary.
Do you know
about Desi Collings?
Yeah, I know
all about Desi Collings.
MARYBETH: He was obsessed.
He attempted suicide after Amy
broke up with him sophomore year.
We had to file
a restraining order.
This would be high school?
Twenty years ago?
But he recently moved
to St. Louis.
That's just two hours away.
To be fair,
he is from St. Louis.
RAND: We also have
Tommy O'Hara.
This is only
eight years ago,
in New York.
She broke up with him,
he got very physical.
She filed charges.
BONEY: What was the charge?
Sexual assault,
threat, battery, what?
I only know it was bad.
I didn't know this.
BONEY: Okay.
Thank you.
Uh, anything more recent?
Not that I know of.
Hey, Nick?
You got a minute?
Yeah.
Imagine our confusion.
A missing persons case...
and in your
wife's dressing room...
we find an envelope
marked "clue."
That's for our anniversary.
My wife does
these treasure hunts.
I'm hoping you can tell me
what this means.
You want to solve
Amy's treasure hunt?
It'll help me track Amy's
movements before she disappeared.
Of course. Okay.
"Although this spot
couldn't be tighter...
"it's a cozy room
for my favorite writer."
I know this one!
AMY: Although this spot
couldn't be any tighter...
it's a cozy room for
my favorite writer.
After-school meeting,
don't mind if I do.
Maybe I'll teach
you a thing or two.
Well, well.
What does it say?
Clue two.
"Hey, handsome man,
let's go undercover.
"You'll be the spy,
and I'll be his lover.
"Let's head on over...
"to the little brown house.
"We'll play hot,
doting husband,
sweet, loving spouse."
These yours?
No.
But you read
the first clue.
Randy professor,
naughty student.
I blush.
Me and my ex
just swapped cards.
Where's this
little brown house?
I have no idea.
Hello?
Nicholas Dunne.
Under my father's name,
William Dunne.
My wife's first pet?
Is this necessary?
Can you just
turn the bell...
Yeah, I know.
It's, uh... It's, uh...
Uh...
It's "Puddles," right?
Or is it "Poodles?"
We're good.
Hello, stranger.
Fancy meeting you here.
It's your
dad's house, right?
Are you following me?
What you doing?
Like you said,
it's my dad's house.
I come by once a week,
make sure the place
hasn't burned down.
But it looks okay.
I'll walk you out.
You know...
I thought maybe this was
the little brown house.
From the clue.
Nope. Still blue.
AMY: Picture me,
I'm a girl who's
very, very bad.
I need to be punished,
and by "punished,"
I mean "had."
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.
"So open the door,
and look alive."
Bitch!
AMY: Want to test your
marriage for weak spots?
Promise me we'll
never be like them.
Like who?
All those awful
couples we know.
Those wives who treat their
men like dancing monkeys...
to be trained and paraded.
Husbands who treat their wives
like the highway patrol...
to be out-foxed
and avoided.
I think I'm gonna
be laid off.
We're in a recession. If it
happens, we'll deal with it.
I'll probably be next.
We have each other.
Everything else is
background noise.
You are exceptional.
My turn.
My parents' publisher
dropped them...
and they're in debt
up to their ears.
That's terrible.
And they need to borrow
from my trust fund.
How much?
Almost a million.
That's almost all of it.
This is where you say, "Everything
else is background noise."
Amy, if you're laid off...
and I'm laid off...
I said I'd do it.
Without talking to me?
Well, it's...
Your call.
...their money,
technically.
You know what?
You're right.
Everything else
is just background noise.
Hey-
More games?
Yeah, I just wanted
to shoot some folks.
What's the laptop for?
Laptop-ing.
Oh, I see.
You can give your parents
$879,000 without talking to me...
but God forbid
I buy a video game...
without getting
your permission.
You are spending a lot.
You don't trust me.
You don't trust my judgment.
You certainly don't
trust my intention.
What are you talking about?
That's the basic tenet
of a prenup, isn't it?
Why are you throwing
that in my face again?
Because it's easy to throw.
Nick, I don't get it.
I don't get why
you're daring me...
to be someone
I don't wanna be.
The nagging shrew.
The controlling bitch.
I'm not that person. I'm your wife.
I'm sorry.
I just don't know how to do this.
I've never not had a job.
I flipped burgers,
I painted houses.
You'll get another job.
Hi, Go.
What? Hold on. What?
AMY: And suddenly...
Slow
AMY: ...I knew everything
was about to get worse.
Okay, tell me
what's wrong.
Bless you, Nick.
Father.
Hey, Tom. Mayor!
Nick, good to see you.
NICK: Good to see you.
Hey, guys, hey-
Jodie.
Nick.
Oh, we'll find her.
Mmm-hmm.
You look like
hammered shit.
Oh, thank you.
You ever see that guy
in the glasses before?
Don't worry.
We videotape everybody...
that comes in
and out of these things.
I mean, you tend
to get a lot of...
Do-gooders?
Freaks.
Hey, I meant to ask you.
Noelle Hawthorne?
She lives on your street.
Amy's best friend.
I've never heard the name
Noelle Hawthorne.
She and her husband
have triplets.
Oh.
Yeah, we might say
hi to them on the street.
But "best friend"? No.
Excuse me, one sec.
He acted like Noelle was
a complete stranger.
Of course he did.
Look, these two are yours.
Oh, look.
He's being a good guy...
so everybody can see him
being a good guy.
Oh, you really don't
like him, do you?
What's to like?
AUTOMATED VOICE:
This mailbox is currently full.
Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.
My name's Shawna Kelly.
I am so sorry
for your troubles.
Thank you. That's kind.
Are you remembering to eat?
Well, a lot of cold cuts.
I'm gonna fix you up my
world-famous chicken Frito pie.
That's very kind
and very unnecessary.
You have to
keep your strength.
Would you...
say, "Chicken Frito pie!"
Um...
You know what?
Would you delete
that picture for me?
It's a nice photo.
I know it is.
But just do me a favor.
Will you?
Would you go ahead and
please delete that picture?
You just press...
What is
wrong with you?
Could you please not
share that with anyone?
I will share it
with whomever I please.
GO: Dude.
Yeah?
Marybeth is pissed.
Why?
Marybeth?
It's like you're the
goddamn Homecoming King.
It was important to my
mother that I be polite...
I be considerate,
I be a gentleman.
It looked like
you were having fun.
l am in a nightmare!
All I'm trying to do
is be nice...
to the people who are
volunteering to help find Amy.
You're right.
And I'm sorry.
My God, this place literally
smells like feces.
In your searches, did you find
any golf clubs, real fancy?
No.
How about a brand
new Stratocaster?
No, nothing like that.
Well, all right.
How big's that TV?
It's not 65-inch.
No, it's nowhere
near that.
Okay-
Kibble?
Excuse me?
He asked me
to feed his cat.
Oh, I saw some
in the pantry.
NOELLE: Detective Boney, Officer Gilpin?
Noelle Hawthorne!
I know y'all are in there!
Would you please
escort Miss Hawthorne...
and her children
back out to the street?
Detective Boney!
Just remind her it is a
possible crime scene.
Look at that
pie-eating grin...
from a guy whose
wife is missing.
How are you doing?
Terrific.
How's Marybeth?
She's a wreck.
And you?
Awesome.
Hey...
have you told
me everything?
Of course.
Everything?
Why would you
even ask me that?
Ever since you walked into
The Bar that morning
Amy went missing, you seem...
off.
I am off.
Everybody's examining me and
projecting their shit on me.
All I want is to
come over here,
have a beer with you...
and not be judged.
Can we do that?
Of course.
You know what
I keep thinking?
If Mom were here?
Yeah. Like I'm 12.
Nick, Mom would fix it.
I'm gonna go Benadryl
myself to sleep.
Love you.
Love you.
AMY: strange,
new sentence.
Mmm, bye, Dad.
AMY: No money, no jobs,
no prospects.
And then,
we heard from Go.
Mama Maureen...
But I don't know
if he's happy I'm with him.
I feel like something
he loaded by mistake.
Something to be jettisoned,
if necessary.
I feel like
I could disappear.
Oh, my God!
I saw you on TV.
Okay.
It's so crazy.
Yeah, I know.
She just vanished?
She's just gone.
I've been so worried about you.
Where have you been?
I called you a hundred times.
You gotta pick up your phone!
Rehearsals.
What?
My sister's
asleep in the other room.
I needed to see you.
I know this is a bad idea.
Can you at least
tell me you love me?
I do love you, but we have to
be really careful right now.
Oh, I've been so scared.
Between rehearsals?
You told me I needed
to have my own life.
I know.
We need to stop.
I need you.
Touch me.
Stop it. Come here.
Sit down.
Okay-
Did you, by any chance, tell
anybody anything about us?
Even in texting,
or on Facebook.
Facebook? I use
the disposable phone.
You buy my presents in cash.
I'm not stupid, Nick.
I know, sweetie.
Did you leave a pair of
red panties in my office?
I don't know. Maybe.
They better be mine.
Sweetheart, think.
I don't know. I'd have to
check my red panty inventory.
Andie, I need you
to take this seriously, okay?
This is the last time we're
gonna see each other, until...
Until when?
Until it's safe.
You were going
to get a divorce.
Never say that
out loud again.
Okay. I'm sorry.
I don't wanna fight.
I just wanna be with you.
Andie, oh, please...
That's all I want.
I can't.
It's our last time together.
Let's make the most of it.
NICK: Real quick,
but then you have to go.
AMY: My husband
has come undone.
We moved to Missouri
to save Maureen...
but as it turns out,
we couldn't.
It means a lot
that you came.
AMY: hit on
the brownstone...
and I used the last of my
trust fund to buy him a bar.
So far,
it's just costing money.
Nick uses me for sex
when he wants.
Otherwise, I don't exist.
Whoo!
We should go to
Outback tonight.
That would be nice.
AMY: Last night, I went
from desperate to pathetic.
I became someone
I don't even like.
The kind of woman
I used to mock.
You're out so much.
I know.
Stay home.
I can't, I'm already late.
Then, can I come?
You would hate it.
It's a bunch of my dorky
high school friends.
Do our code.
No bullshit.
I thought we weren't
gonna be that couple.
Okay, bye.
Hey, I've been thinking. Yeah?
Something positive.
Maybe it's time.
Now is literally
the worst time.
It would be
a new start for us.
And for me, I would have
a real purpose here.
A child is not a hobby.
Not a hobby.
An inspiration.
We could have had this fight
four hours ago. I'm late.
I didn't know it was
gonna be a fight.
You really wanna be the
couple that has a baby...
to save their marriage?
"Save"?
Reboot, retool,
rekindle, whatever!
And you're gonna walk
out the door now? Yeah!
You're a fucking coward.
No, it can't
go on like this.
Oh, really?
I won't.
You won't?
You won't? Why, it's not
good enough for you?
It's not even close!
You stupid bitch!
AMY: What scared me
wasn't that he'd pushed me.
What scared me was how much
he wanted to hurt me more.
What scared me was
that I'd finally realized...
I am frightened
of my own husband.
You want me to
call for backup?
Nah, I'll protect you.
GILPIN: Jesus.
They ought to burn
this place down.
BONEY: Seems like
folks are trying.
You really think
this is anything?
Cross it off the list.
Hey, Jason.
What's up, Rhonda?
"...and dedicated to the
proposition that all men..."
Have you seen this
girl around here?
JASON: Why do you ask?
She was reported missing.
"...and so dedicated,
can long endure."
Yeah. I remember her.
What did she want?
Weed, pills?
She wanted a gun.
I told her
it's not my thing.
I felt bad, though.
She seemed really desperate.
She said it needed
to be small...
so she could
keep it close.
Are you sure
this is her?
You don't forget a girl
like that in here.
She was all in pink.
It was Valentine's Day.
AMY: For Valentine's Day,
I thought I'd buy a gun.
That is how crazy
I've become.
Nick wants me gone but he
won't ask for a divorce.
In his mind, I'm the owner of his
bar, his only line of credit.
I could go home
to my parents...
but I'd have to
tell them the truth.
And I don't even know if I believe
the truth.
Can I really think
Nick would hurt me?
I'd sleep better
with a gun.
NICK: Oh, shit.
Wake up, baby. My
sister's gonna come out here.
Sorry to rush you.
It's okay.
Here. Let me help you.
Okay.
Just get that.
Be very careful.
I'm all right.
Here you go.
Promise me
we'll talk every day.
Okay, we will.
Every day, Nick,
or I'll go crazy.
Don't go crazy.
Okay-
GO: You fucking idiot.
You fucking asshole! You fucking
lied to my fucking face!
I'm sorry.
How old is she?
She's in her early 20s.
How long?
A year and a half.
You lied to me
for over a year?
Oh, if I told you, you
would have made me stop.
It's so fucking small.
You're a liar and a cheat!
You're just like Dad!
How did you
even meet her?
She's one of my students.
I thought writers hated cliches.
Oh, I'm not a writer.
"Oh, boo-hoo, I got laid off.
I guess I'll fuck a teenager."
It wasn't like that, okay?
You have no idea how shitty
it was with Amy...
how fucking terrible
she made me feel.
Flyover Boy.
I would get
knots in my stomach...
just coming home, knowing she
would be sitting there...
dissatisfied, before I even
walked in the fucking door.
This is so bad.
If anybody finds out,
you're totally fucked.
Boney found a pair of panties
in my office...
where, occasionally,
Andie and I...
I don't know what
the fuck it means.
Her name is Andie.
She's not entirely sure.
So we are dealing
with a 20-year-old...
who isn't sure where
she leaves her undies?
If they're not Andie's, that
means that they're Amy's...
and she left them
there for me to find.
Nick, I was scared
for you before...
and now,
I'm fucking petrified.
We're having a vigil tonight
for your missing wife...
and this morning, you're kissing
your college girlfriend goodbye!
Can you imagine?
Have you watched
television lately?
Cable news is
all over your shit.
I mean, what is wrong
with this barkeep?
His wife's nowhere
to be found...
and here's Nick Dunne
for you, flirting.
Who is that?
Some fucking
tragedy groupie.
Who the fuck is that?
I don't know.
She was trying to
give me a casserole.
On the show today
we have defense attorney,
Tanner Bolt...
patron saint to wife-killers
everywhere-
Tanner Bolt,
would you actually
consider defending Nick Dunne?
TANNER: Well,
let me just say...
as always, Ellen,
thank you for such
a warm welcome.
But of course,
I'd defend Nick Dunne.
Listen, just because
this guy isn't walking
around weeping...
that doesn't mean
that he's not hurting.
Tanner, the hallmark of a
sociopath is a lack of empathy.
TANNER: But the truth is,
you'd have to
be
to behave normally
in this situation...
because it's the most
abnormal situation
in the world.
Tanner, are you trying
to tell me that this photo...
is remotely in the realm
of acceptable behavior?
I'm so sick of being
picked apart by women.
You need to
hire Tanner Bolt.
I don't deserve this.
That's exactly
what you deserve.
Go home, Nick.
Hey, buddy.
GILPIN: I can't believe
we haven't arrested this guy.
BONEY: We're not gonna
arrest anybody...
just because some
blonde dunce says so.
Why are you going so easy on him?
You got a crush?
One, l am conducting
an investigation,
not a witch-hunt.
And, two, don't talk
to me that way, ever.
She was trying
to buy a gun.
We don't know who
or what was scaring her, Gil.
Give me the update.
No drug angles panned out yet,
so cross that off the list.
I talked to the nurses
who care for Nick's father.
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as
a kitten, so cross that off the list.
Hey.
BONEY: Hey.
So, luminol lit up the kitchen
like the 4th of July.
Whoa.
Yeah.
DONNELLY:
The blood is profuse.
It is Amy's, type B,
and we should have DNA soon.
BONEY: Thoughts on a weapon?
DONNELLY: Trajectory
indicates blunt force.
Maybe a club or a two-by-four.
She fell there,
but I doubt she got back up.
Amy's medical
records come in?
No, we'll have them
later tonight.
My wife says
he's a killer.
Well, if Tiffany says...
Hey-
Hey-
Thank you all
for coming out.
Hey Donnie,
how are you?
Rich, thank you so much.
NICK: Hey.
Hmm.
Thank you, folks.
Thank you for
being here tonight.
It just means the world
to our family.
And to Amy.
As you all know...
my wife,
Amy Elliott Dunne...
disappeared three days ago.
And I want to implore anyone who
has any information at all...
please come forward.
Help us.
So hot.
Ew! He is so creepy.
I wanna say something...
because I think some of
you might be wondering...
and are too polite to ask.
I had nothing to do with the
disappearance of my wife.
I'm cooperating
with the police.
I haven't hired a lawyer.
I have nothing to hide.
Amy is my soul mate.
She is brilliant...
she's charming,
and wise.
I love you, Amy.
Asshole.
I love my wife...
so much.
And I may not behave for the
cameras the way they want me to...
and if they wanna punish
me for that, that's okay.
But I just wanna ask you in the
media, please, harass me...
but don't harass the people of this town.
If you need to mock
somebody, mock me.
NOELLE:  Nick!
But please don't turn this
investigation into a circus.
Where's your wife, Nick?
Let the police
do their jobs.
What did you do to
your pregnant wife?
NOELLE: Did you tell
them that, Nick?
Did you tell them Amy
was six weeks pregnant?
Thank you for your support tonight.
Let's find Amy.
Go ahead, if you guys
wanna say something.
Gil, go, go.
MAN 1: Nick,
where are you going?
MAN 2: Stop him!
GILPIN: No questions right now.
Thank you.
MAN 3: Why are
you running away?
MAN 4: Don't run.
Everybody, stay back.
Guys, come on.
You know better.
Get off the grass,
get down to the curb.
Hey, Gil...
GILPIN: On it.
All right.
All right, y'all heard her.
No pictures.
Hello?
Hello?
Fuck.
You scared me.
Want a drink?
Did you know
she was pregnant?
I told you, Noelle Hawthorne
is fucking crazy.
She doesn't even know Amy.
They look like pretty
good friends to me.
Look, I don't know.
But it certainly doesn't prove
that she's pregnant.
We have her
medical records coming.
Good. So, let's
talk while we wait.
Let's start over here.
The scene of the crime.
You see, we've seen dozens
of home invasions.
Dozens and dozens.
This area right here, it looked
wrong from the second we saw it.
The whole thing looked staged.
Watch this.
And yet, they remained upright
throughout this life-and-death struggle?
I don't know. What do
you want me to say?
Did you do any housekeeping the
day your wife went missing?
No. Because our guys
did a luminol test.
And I'm sorry to tell you,
but that kitchen lit up.
Amy lost a lot of blood
in there, Nick. A lot.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, and then
somebody mopped it up.
Oh... Wait a second. Why would
they mop up the blood...
if they're trying to stage
a crime scene?
No blood and no body
suggests kidnapping.
It tells us, look at
people outside the house.
Like these homeless
you keep mentioning.
A pool of blood and no
body suggests homicide.
It tells us to look at
people inside the house.
Which is what
we're doing here, Nick.
I see.
BONEY: So, how was
your marriage, Nick?
Because right now,
all we got is Noelle.
She says, "Not good."
Gil, what do you
and your wife argue about?
What pisses you off?
Oh, money, lack thereof.
BONEY: Me and my ex,
it's the same.
I mention that because we got a
look at your finances, Nick.
$117,000
in credit card debt.
What? I pulled up some
of the merchandise.
There are these
fun little splurges.
NICK: I didn't buy
any of this stuff.
I don't even golf!
I do!
You bought great clubs.
I like the robot dog.
This is identity theft!
This is a felony!
We need to find out
who did this!
All right. Let's talk
about life insurance.
Because in April, you bumped
up Amy's life insurance...
to $1.2 million.
Yes, I did. That was her idea.
She wanted me to.
You filed the paperwork.
Because she told me to!
Whoa!
Hold on a sec.
Yeah? Okay.
For sure?
All right.
She was pregnant.
This is insane.
So, my question becomes...
I don't want to talk
to you again, ever...
without a lawyer.
MALE REPORTER: Margo!
Hey-
NICK: Just hold on a second.
Let me finish.
Nick?
NICK: I hear you, I hear you.
I was as surprised as...
I know you're upset. I had
no idea she was pregnant.
Listen, I thought so, too,
but evidently that wasn't...
You want to
know the truth?
The truth is,
Amy didn't want kids.
Well, I'm as surprised as...
You told me
you didn't want kids.
I was trying
to put a good face on.
Then, suddenly,
you've got a pregnant wife.
That's a problem for you.
Especially when you factor in
the secret teenage girlfriend.
Oh, stop watching
Ellen Abbott!
You have to
fucking talk to me!
I didn't tell you that
she didn't want kids...
because she didn't
want me to.
Because it would
have just been...
another reason
for you to hate her.
And we had enough of those already!
It was easier to just...
Lie to me?
I wanted kids!
When we first moved here,
I went to a fertility clinic!
It didn't work?
I did my part!
Masturbate.
When it came time...
for Amy to do her thing,
all of a sudden it was like...
"Well, I don't know.
Maybe. No, thanks."
Now, who would believe you?
All right.
This is a letter
from the clinic...
notifying me that they're
gonna destroy my sample...
unless I contact them.
So, I gave it to Amy.
The next day,
I saw it in the trash.
But you were already with
Andie by then, right?
I wanted a baby with Amy.
A year ago,
Amy being pregnant...
would have been
the best thing ever!
"When your poor Amy has a
cold, this dessert just..."
This is the clue
you couldn't solve.
Yeah.
A letter from Desi.
That creepy boyfriend
of Amy's?
It was the fucking rich guy who
would do anything for her.
It just kept hanging over my head.
It was disgusting.
Your prenup?
Nick, why have
you kept this stuff?
It's like
a little box of hate.
I don't know, Go!
Maybe I hate her!
I love you no matter what.
But you need to tell me.
Tell you what?
What are you asking me?
Are you asking me
if I killed my wife, Go?
Is that what you're asking me?
If I murdered my wife?
I would never
ask you that!
ALL REPORTERS: Margo!
Don't walk on the glass.
Oh.
You have no clue,
do you?
BONEY: Why was
he here that night?
His wife is missing.
Why come here?
Who cares?
Rhonda, we got this.
Let's make the arrest.
Do you know how hard it is to make
a murder case without a body?
No.
Well, it's incredibly hard.
So, I want one last thing.
What's that?
I want a body.
AMY: Picture me,
I'm a girl who's
very, very bad.
GILPIN: Be careful.
AMY: I need to be punished,
and by "punished,"
I mean "had."
Fuck.
AMY: It's where you keep
goodies for anniversary five.
Punish. Wood. Beach.
Punish. Wood.
Wood.
AMY: I will practice believing
my husband loves me...
That this child might
really save our marriage.
me...
this man of mine
may kill me.
WTF?
AMY: I am so much happier
now that I'm dead.
And my lazy, lying,
cheating, oblivious husband...
will go to prison
for my murder.
Nick Dunne took my pride
and my dignity...
He took and took from me
until I no longer existed.
Let the punishment
fit the crime.
To fake a convincing murder,
you have to have discipline.
Harvest the details
of her humdrum life.
And cram her with stories
about your husband's
violent temper.
Secretly create
some money troubles.
Credit cards,
perhaps online gambling.
With the help of
the unwitting...
Purchase getaway car.
Craigslist.
You need to package
yourself so that people
will truly mourn your loss.
And America loves
pregnant women.
As if it's so hard
to spread your legs.
Invite pregnant idiot
into your home...
A pregnancy is now part
of your legal medical record.
Wait for your
clueless husband...
Meticulously stage
your crime scene...
with just enough mistakes
to raise the specter of doubt.
You need to clean poorly...
like he would.
Clean and bleed.
Bleed and clean.
And leave a little
something behind.
And because you're you...
you don't stop there.
Minimum, 300 entries
on the Nick and Amy story.
Start with
the fairy tale early days.
Those are true.
And they're crucial.
You want Nick and Amy
to be likeable.
After that, you in vent.
The spending.
And Nick thought
he was the writer.
Burn it just
the right amount.
Make sure
the cops will find it.
Finally, honor tradition with
a very special treasure hunt.
And if I get everything right,
the world will hate Nick...
for killing his beautiful,
pregnant wife.
And after all the outrage,
when I'm ready...
I'll go out on the water
with a handful of pills...
And when they find my body,
they'll know...
Nick Dunne dumped
his beloved like garbage.
And she floated down
past all the other...
abused, unwanted,
inconvenient women.
But, then,
we never really existed.
Nick loved a girl
I was pretending to be.
Men always use that
as their defining compliment.
Cool Girl never
gets angry at her man.
She only smiles in a
chagrined, loving manner...
and then presents
her mouth for fucking.
So evidently,
he's a vinyl hipster
who loves fetish manga.
If he likes Girls Gone Wild,
she's a mall babe...
who talks football
and endures
buffalo wings at Hooters.
When I met Nick Dunne,
I knew he wanted Cool Girl.
And for him, I'll admit,
I was willing to try.
I wax-stripped
my pussy raw.
I drank canned beer
watching Adam Sandier movies.
I ate cold pizza
and remained a size two.
I can't say
I didn't enjoy some of it.
Nick teased out of me
things I didn't know existed.
A lightness,
a humor, an ease.
But I made him smarter.
Sharper.
I inspired him to
rise to my level.
I forged the man
of my dreams.
We were happy pretending
to be other people.
We were the happiest
couple we knew.
And what's the point
of being together
if you're not the happiest?
lazy.
He became someone
I did not agree to marry.
He actually expected me
to love him unconditionally.
Then he dragged me, penniless,
to the navel of
this great country...
and found himself a newer,
younger, bouncier...
You think
I'd let him destroy me
and end up happier than ever?
My cute, charming,
salt-of-the-earth,
Missouri guy.
He needed to learn.
Wait.
I need 20 seconds where
you don't judge me,
interrupt me...
or get angry.
Okay-
Is that all the stuff
from the credit cards?
Where do you store goodies
for anniversary five?
Wood.
Yeah, my woodshed.
That fucking bitch.
I thought...
It's all right.
I would have, too.
What's that present?
I don't know.
Let's find out.
"Dear Husband...
"I know you think
you're moving through
this world unseen.
"Don't believe
that for a second.
"I know where you've been, and
I know where you're going."
"For this anniversary,
I've arranged a trip.
"Follow the river,
up, up, up.
"Sit back and relax,
because you are done."
What's "up, up river"?
"Up the river." Prison.
Fucking crazy bitch.
That's what this is.
She's framing me
for her murder.
You married
a complete psychopath.
The morning of
our anniversary...
I was gonna ask her for a divorce.
I just couldn't do it.
I couldn't fake it for
another year, another day.
Then what happened?
Before I could say anything,
she said...
"I need you to go somewhere and
really think about our marriage."
She knew I would
go to Sawyer Beach.
So you'd have no alibi.
She stage-managed me.
She knew exactly what I would do.
And I fucking did it.
I went to the beach,
I thought about our marriage.
I came back and decided
I wanted a divorce.
And by the time
you got home...
She was gone.
Oh, you fuck!
She's good.
Part of me was relieved...
when I thought
she was gone.
Punch and Judy puppets.
Remember, he beats Judy to
death and kills that baby.
So I'm Punch.
We already knew that, Amy,
what's your point?
Does Missouri have
the death penalty?
GRETA: Hey, neighbor.
It's been weeks since I had
anyone decent next door.
Well, I don't know
how decent I feel.
Well, as long as you
don't own a python...
and blast death metal
at 4 AM...
we're gonna be best friends.
All right.
Nice meeting you.
I'm Greta.
I'm Nancy.
Are you going to the marina?
I could use some creamer.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't.
I've got work to do.
All right.
See you around!
You Will.
Come on. Show me that
darling Nicky smile.
You asshole.
Hey-
Nancy.
Nancy.
It's hot again today.
So, uh,
where are you from?
Let me guess.
Nebraska.
New Orleans.
You know,
l am an expert oiler.
Oh, I just bet you are.
Lotions and balms.
Ointment.
I would hate
for y'all to get tan lines.
So sweet.
Okay.
You know where I'll be.
I see we have
the same taste in men.
I clipped it on
a bathroom cabinet.
Least you could do is not
keep his secrets for him.
Let me guess.
He's trying to watch the big
game and you just won't shut up.
No, you don't seem
like much of a talker.
Oh, I got it.
You caught your boy rubbing up
on some hot little skank...
and he apologized to you
by busting you a good one.
Worse.
Worse?
I went to the bar where
he works to surprise him.
And out he comes
with this girl
who had no business
being in a bar.
On the very first
night that we met...
we walked by a bakery
that was having
their sugar delivered.
And it was in the air,
everywhere.
he leaned in...
He did the exact
same thing with her.
That is the most disgusting
thing I ever heard.
Thank you.
Wow.
Thanks very much.
Well, we've gone mainstream.
It's an appeals process, so we
will attempt to appeal to them.
Mr. Bolt.
Tanner Bolt?
Nick Dunne.
I have been
sitting by the phone,
my friend.
I'm sorry.
Do you not believe me?
No, I believe you.
It's just the craziest
thing I've ever heard.
I love it.
But, for you, it sucks.
But you gotta have
a grudging respect...
for your wife at
this point, right?
Are you laughing me out
of the building? No!
Are you kidding me?
I'm in.
I'm way in.
You came to the right guy.
This is what I do, Nick.
This is why I have
a $100,000 retainer.
I win the unwinnable cases.
$100,000?
We'll figure something out.
I'll give you a special...
"my wife is skilled in the
art of vengeance" rate.
Okay-
So, what's the plan?
Well, right now,
it's a "he said, she said."
She's telling a better story.
No, Nick.
She is telling
the perfect story.
So, we need to start today
to prepare your defense,
should we need it.
And if we decide to go
with your version of...
The truth.
Then we'll need to realign
the public's
perception of Amy.
Make them stop seeing her
as America's sweetheart...
and see her
for what she is...
which a mind-fucker
of the first degree.
Now, that is
a huge realignment.
We'll need other
voices besides yours.
There has to be
someone out there...
that she's screwed
with in the past.
There's a New York guy.
O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.
Eight years ago...
she pressed
charges against him.
That should be
easy to find.
Um, ex-classmate,
Desi Collings.
She said that he stalked her.
He's in St. Louis.
You go talk to Tommy,
and I'll draw up the contract.
I told you,
you came to the right guy.
Apparently.
Tommy?
Yeah.
Thanks for seeing me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Urn, you're gonna
want a drink.
Yeah.
NICK: So, she said you
got physical with her.
No, dude,
she said I raped her.
First degree, felony rape.
Did you do it?
Did you do it?
Yeah.
I was looking at
Did you get a trial?
Fuck, no.
Do I look like I would
do well in the yard?
I pled down, man.
Sexual assault one,
no jail time.
That's something.
Oh, yeah.
I've been unemployed
for the last eight years...
because I have to
write "sexual offender"
on every job application.
I'm on
a neighborhood watch list...
because I have to
register as a predator.
I haven't had a date
in almost a decade...
because if
a girl googles me...
Could you walk me
through what happened?
I meet Amy at
this party, you know?
We click. She's perfect.
She's beautiful,
she's smart,
she's well-read...
she's got an ass
like a 20-year-old stripper.
I think,
"What's the catch?"
A few months, it hits me.
This is not going to be easy.
Girls like a fixer-upper,
but Amy?
She annexed me.
She made me her business.
It was just too much. She
went out and bought me ties.
And we must have gone
Ties. The whole thing
just became...
So, you broke up with her.
No, I just backed away.
Gave her some space.
No big deal, right?
So I thought.
Then one night, Amy comes
over to my place...
with a bottle of bourbon
and a bootleg of
this band I love.
And within two minutes,
she's got my pants
around my ankles...
and she is
kneeling down, and...
I'm sorry.
I know it's your wife.
You had sex?
Yeah, consensual.
It was rough, but she
was screaming for it.
Next morning, there's
two cops at my door.
Amy has wounds that
are consistent with rape.
Ligature marks on her
wrist, and my semen.
It looks like I've tied Amy
to my bed, and raped her.
Me!
And then,
guess what they find.
Headboards of my bed,
one on each side.
The ties you wouldn't wear.
You do know your wife.
Did you ever see her again?
Yeah.
On TV, last week,
with you.
I thought, "There's Amy.
"She's graduated from being
raped to being murdered."
Mmm!
You been watching this,
too?
ELLEN:
Last night's bombshell.
We just found out...
Amy Elliott Dunne was, indeed,
pregnant when she went missing.
Kelly Capitono,
this makes me wanna throw up.
What is it about
a pregnant woman...
a woman carrying
life inside her...
KELLY: Ellen,
this is an epidemic.
The third leading cause of
death among pregnant women...
is homicide committed by
a boyfriend or husband.
Let's not forget
about the wife, ever.
Tonight, we welcome Amy's best
friend, Noelle Hawthorne.
Thanks for being
on the show, Noelle.
Amy would have loved you,
and all you do for women.
Why don't you tell us about your
friend, Noelle?
Oh, I'd love if just once,
someone was like...
"She was a real rag."
She was beautiful
and smart and kind.
Seems like a rich
bitch to me.
What do you mean?
People love her.
GRETA: I don't know.
She seems uppity.
Spoiled rich girl,
married a cheating asshole.
Paid the ultimate price.
NOELLE: The only secret
was her husband.
ELLEN: Why was that, Noelle?
Why do you think?
Because he had
a violent temper.
A little harsh.
That's life, baby.
He knew I'd have
seen right through him.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not saying it's
okay he killed her.
I'm just saying,
there are consequences.
Fuck, yeah.
You're a good friend, Noelle. And
you're a good friend of the show.
Thanks for coming on.
Please tell me you
landed Tanner Bolt.
Tanner Bolt landed me.
I'm gonna try and see Desi
Collings on my way home.
And, Go...
Tanner's retainer
is $100,000.
That's just the retainer.
Listen,
I've got $47,000 in savings.
I've got $2,500 in an IRA.
I'm approved for a second
mortgage on the house.
We will go from there.
Thank you.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Nick keeps his father, who has
Alzheimer's, in a facility.
Number of times he
visited last year?
One.
Oh, fuck!
His twin sister, Margo,
well, she is a peach.
These two spend their days
in the bar Amy bought them.
Playing what, Lauren?
Playing house?
What the fuck?
Twin siblings
often enable and abet.
While I never examined Nick,
or his sister...
they both seem very,
very close.
It's twin-cest.
And so,
we close with a question.
allows a beautiful, talented,
kind, smart, loving mother...
to vanish without the heavens
hearing our outraged cries?
Can I bum a cigarette?
Yeah.
Amy Elliott Dunne, we care about
you, and we will not forget.
And you know what else
we won't forget?
Missouri has
the death penalty.
Amen.
I'd like to report
some strange activity...
near the woodshed on the
property of one Margo Dunne.
Hey-
Mr. Dunne.
Mr. Collings.
I know you.
I saw you at
the volunteer center.
I wanted to help.
Well, I hope you don't
mind me coming by.
I got your address
from this letter
that you wrote my wife.
Amy and I believe in the
lost art of letter-writing.
I always wondered why you
kept in touch
after...
everything.
You were together for two years
in boarding school, right?
She was my first
serious girlfriend.
Why did you break up?
That's a strange question.
Did you treat her bad?
Did you cheat on her?
That's a rude question.
Let me tell you
what Amy told me.
She dumped you,
you completely unraveled.
You stalked her,
you threatened her...
and you attempted
suicide in her bed
and were institutionalized.
Your wife is missing,
and you came all this
way to tell me this?
I thought there might be
another side to this story.
Mr. Collings.
Fuck.
MAN:
...the missing
persons case of Amy Elliott Dunne.
She is the beautiful
blonde inspiration...
for the Amazing Amy
kids' book series.
You're reading
that diary again?
You know how it ends.
It interests me.
Hey, Rhonda.
"He's gonna kill me."
The end.
Why did he go to his
dad's house to burn it?
It's private.
There's no one there.
Why didn't he make sure
it actually burned?
Because he tripped the alarm.
You were up his ass
with a flashlight.
The whole thing
just feels hinky.
Like finding
an envelope marked "Clue."
You ever hear
the expression...
"The simplest answer
is often the correct one"?
Actually, I've never
found that to be true.
Good night.
Good night.
Hey-
Elvis is in Missouri.
Thank God.
Come on in.
NICK: First thing you have
to understand about Amy...
she loves
to teach lessons.
Play God.
Yeah, Old Testament God.
Okay. Keep talking.
She finds out I've been
cheating on her with Andie...
decides to
teach me a lesson.
Fakes her own death,
frames me for it.
Blood in the house, credit
cards, life insurance.
She does the treasure hunt.
NICK: Now, the treasure
hunt is critical.
She's taking us on
a tour of my infidelities.
Rubbing my nose in it.
And she leaves clue number
one for the police...
which will lead them
back to my office...
which is a place where
Andie and I would often...
And she leaves
a pair of red panties.
Right. Racy, looks bad.
Clue two.
My father's house.
Another place
where Andie and I...
would occasionally
have relations.
Clue three?
Woodshed.
Also a location...
Oh, my God.
We had limited options.
A hotel.
Amy would have seen
the credit card bill.
Put it on
Andie's credit card.
Andie's statement
went right to her parents.
Ew.
Nick, Margo, can we head
over to the little brown house?
This leads us to what?
My dad's house.
Dad's house is blue.
After the divorce,
when Dad wasn't
coming around...
I used to pretend
that he was a spy
named Mr. Brown, who...
for the sake of his
children's safety,
had to deny their existence.
You never told me that.
You told her that?
We've got
incriminating red
panties in your office.
We've got a Showcase Showdown
worth of crap
in your woodshed.
So, what in God's name is at
your father's house, Nick?
And be honest.
I honestly have no idea.
TANNER: Well...
Whatever they found,
I think it's safe to
assume that it's very bad.
TANNER: lot of
uncontained issues here.
Nick, do you have any idea
as to what Andie's mindset is?
Well, we haven't
communicated since the vigil.
Okay. Amy's parents?
No, it's...
More pressure.
We got a hurt,
young girlfriend...
who will no doubt go public
at any moment.
No, Andie won't do that.
She will.
They always do.
Don't take it personally.
Amy's got us in
an interesting bind.
We need to tell
the cops about Andie.
Really?
Right now,
Andie just gives
you another motive.
We need to tell the cops
about the woodshed.
We need to be on
the front end of that.
But I'm gonna warn you
as to what will happen.
They'll go after Margo.
They can't do that,
can they?
She's your accomplice.
She helped you
hide the evidence.
In all likelihood,
she knows that you killed Amy.
Oh, God.
Well, what are we
going to do?
We find Amy.
No. Any other strategy
is missing the point.
I've got two ex-Secret Service
guys that are really good.
I'll put them on it.
But where do they start,
Nick?
Where would Amy go?
I have no idea.
Oh!
Are we keeping score?
Hey!
I thought we were steering
clear of men for a while.
He's nice.
Because he wants
to fuck you.
She's still
moping about her ex?
He got cheated on, too.
We three are the saddest
sacks in all the Ozarks.
I'm not sad.
I'm angry-
There you go.
I almost drank myself to
death when my wife left me.
I was gonna kill myself.
Can you believe that?
Don't give him the pleasure.
I was going to drown myself
in the Gulf of Mexico...
let myself be dinner
for the great whites.
Gulf is bull sharks,
Miss Nawlins.
Why should I die?
I'm not the asshole.
JEFF:
Please put that on a T-shirt.
Oh!
Miss Moneybags.
l thought you
said you were broke.
That's a fat wad.
It's mostly singles.
Singles?
What are you, a stripper?
Swamp Girls,
or Treasure Chest?
GRETA: We're just teasing.
Don't they tease
people down in NOLA?
ELLEN:
We can expect Nick Dunne's
arrest any day now.
We've got blood in the house,
huge debt,
an unwanted pregnancy.
And we have Amy Elliott Dunne,
missing for five days...
Tanner has a very bad idea
he's going to pitch you.
NICK: Yeah?
You're doing Sharon Schieber
tomorrow in St. Louis.
It could go so wrong.
And you are going
to tell her about Andie.
Nope.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That sounds like
a very bad idea.
You haven't heard from her
in three days.
This is a ticking time bomb.
You've gotta
throw yourself on it.
People are gonna hate me.
And then,
they will forgive you.
A guy admitting that he's a
gigantic asshole on television?
People empathize with that.
Why don't we just
put out a statement?
They need to see you.
Sharon's specials,
they get 10 million viewers.
She is a crusader.
If she takes you
on as a cause...
She's going to
ask real questions.
I will drill you as if you
were doing a deposition.
What to say,
what not to say.
A trained monkey?
A trained monkey
who doesn't get
the lethal injection.
Nick, this case is about
what people think of you.
They need to like you.
Now, you do this
and you will reach
millions of those people.
Maybe I only
need to reach one.
Hello?
GRETA: Hey, baby.
One minute.
Hey. Hey-
You clearing out?
No, I'm just cleaning up.
Let us come in
and say goodbye.
I'll come by before...
Let us give you a hand.
Yeah, you gotta
clear everything out, here.
Dorothy is a real stickler.
Not even a spare hanger
can you leave behind.
Gotta make sure
nothing's tucked inside.
A sock...
or undies
or what have you.
You did a real good job.
Where is the money,
sweetheart?
Look under her dress.
He talked you into this?
I talked him into it.
The second you leave,
I'm calling the cops.
Your glasses are fake.
Your hair's dyed all hamster.
You say your name's Nancy, but you
don't even answer to it half the time.
You're hiding. I don't know
why, and I don't really care.
But you ain't
gonna call the cops.
And I don't think you've
ever really been hit before.
Ow!
Holy shit.
Sorry,
but we really need the money.
GRETA: Next place,
be more careful, okay?
There are a lot
of people out there
a lot worse than we are.
Excuse me.
You can't sleep here.
I did not kill my wife.
Why don't you try it again?
A little less wooden.
I didn't kill my Wife.
What are you doing?
Every time you look smug...
or annoyed or tense,
I'm gonna hit you
with a gummy bear.
That's supposed to
make me less tense?
Let's try it again.
Mr. Dunne,
from what I understand...
you and your wife
had some bumps.
Yeah, we had some tough years.
Um, I lost my job.
You both did.
We both lost our jobs.
I had to move back home
so we could take
care of my mother...
who was dying of cancer
and my dad, who had...
Your dad's scorched earth.
Let's talk about your mom,
how close you were.
Go on.
For a while,
things had been building up.
"Built up" implies that an
explosion is coming. No.
At a certain point,
we got on the wrong track.
I had a moment of weakness.
Your "moment"
was over 15 months.
I disrespected my wife.
And I disrespected
my marriage.
And I'll always regret it.
That works.
Don't be afraid to
play up the dufus
husband thing, Nick.
"I was an idiot.
I'm a fuck-up.
"Everything I do is wrong."
I know. What men are
supposed to do in general.
Thank you.
TANNER: How do you feel?
I feel good.
Go, can you pass
me that box, please?
It's Amy's 33rd
birthday present to me.
You hate that watch.
No, Go.
I love that watch.
Just like I love this tie.
Just like I love my wife.
It's you!
It's you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Good God.
Last week...
I threatened to leave,
and he said he'd find me...
and he'd kill me.
So, I disappeared.
I lost the baby.
I couldn't even
tell my parents.
I'm so ashamed
and I'm so afraid.
Well, he is looking for you.
He showed up on my doorstep
three days ago.
He tracked me from
my letters to you.
You saved them.
Knowing you were out there...
was the only thing that's kept
me going these past few years.
Let's go to the police.
You can explain everything.
No, I can't turn up now.
I'd be a pariah.
Everyone would hate me.
Is it wrong to want
Nick to go prison?
He should go to prison
for what he's done.
I'm setting you up
at my lake house.
It's utterly secluded.
Why are you so good to me?
You know why.
Excuse me.
I know you, don't I?
No.
You're one of
the Nolan girls, right?
No, we're from Winnipeg.
Excuse us.
Oh.
We should leave.
Just a second.
That was Boney.
I'll call her later.
Tannen
Nice to see you.
TANNER: Sharon! Hi.
Hope this is
worth my while.
You're gonna be very happy.
Sharon.
Ms. Schieber. Thank you
so much for doing this.
Can I get you anything to drink
or eat before we get started?
No,
I had some gummy bears.
What the fuck?
I'm sorry?
MALE REPORTER:
We have a major
shocking development...
in the Amazing Amy
disappearance.
Oh, my God.
You little slut.
when he was my
creative writing teacher
at Mill Valley.
Why is she dressed
like a babysitter?
of having been
romantically involved
with a married man.
The girl with
the giant cum-on-me tits.
I truly believed
we were in love.
Now, she looks like
a fucking Mennonite.
No, it is not.
I do not, in my heart,
believe Nick Dunne would
have killed for me.
My prayers go out to
everyone who loves Amy.
I apologize for the pain
this has caused them.
We have loved
Nick Dunne like a son.
Come on,
you're staring at ghosts.
He met our trust
with lie after lie.
Nick is involved in the
disappearance of our daughter.
Well, this just got
very exciting.
We need a moment.
We're gonna have
to bow out of this.
Nothing has changed.
Everything has changed.
An hour ago,
we were ahead of this. Now?
I can handle this.
We're on the defense.
This is a completely
different dynamic.
I can handle it.
She's going to
eat you alive.
Just trust me.
Okay-
Great.
Mic him.
One, two, three,
four, five.
Thank you.
He shouldn't smile
at the makeup artist.
Yeah, no kidding.
MAN: Roll tape.
Five... four...
three... two...
GO: Seriously, I can't believe
how fucking good you were.
Amy brings out the best in me.
Don't.
TANNER:
Keep it together, you two.
At least for
the next 24 hours.
People still hate you.
Women want to
scratch your eyes out.
Andie was really good TV.
She's a good person.
Therein lies
the problem.
Ride this out...
and when Sharon airs tomorrow,
we'll be looking
at a whole new you.
But, until then...
don't show your face.
No problem.
Welcome.
Make yourself at home.
I've got music,
satellite...
Netflix.
Roku.
Internet, obviously.
Here is
a supposedly grown man...
DESI: If there is ever anything
you have a taste for...
and you can't find it...
just let me know
and I will get it for you.
ELLEN: Instead of the A-B-C's,
he taught her
the birds and the bees.
And just think how
her mother must feel
at a time like this.
Wine cellar's downstairs.
l'll get you
some clothes, too.
Not that I don't appreciate
Bait Shop Chic.
The floors are heated,
just dial to your liking.
There's robes and towels.
The shower has steam.
The bathtub has
a massage cycle.
There's a great view,
if you're in the mood.
Blackout curtains
if you're not.
The bed is Savoir.
You'll never get
a better sleep.
Oh.
Oh, this is just
what I need.
I'm so exhausted.
I'll leave you to it, then.
Amy, l am so happy
that you are here.
And I don't want you to
worry for one moment.
There are cameras everywhere.
The exterior,
all along the grounds,
the entryway.
Anyone...
who is caught
coming or going...
will be recorded.
Ah.
You are more than safe.
And I am not letting
you get away again.
Good morning!
Don't do that!
I'm sorry.
I need to feel safe.
You are very safe.
What have you been up to?
Nothing.
Amy, I'm not Nick.
It's hard for me.
After so many years
under someone's thumb...
I know just what
that feels like.
You were never
under my thumb.
On your leash.
Never
A new start.
Decent clothes.
Hair dye. Makeup.
Tweezers.
There's a gym
overlooking the lake.
The sooner you
look like yourself...
the sooner you'll
feel like yourself.
I'll get groceries
for tonight...
we'll watch Sharon Schieber,
and finally move on.
I think that's something
I should watch on my own.
Nonsense.
I'll be back.
And I am looking forward...
to my reunion
with Amy Elliott.
Great.
Good evening,
I'm Sharon Schieber.
Tonight, exclusively...
Hurry up.
A husband breaks
his silence...
not just on his
wife's disappearance...
but on his infidelity,
and all those shocking rumors.
you're probably the most hated
man in America right now.
I probably am.
And I probably deserve it.
I bought that tie.
SHARON:
But you were unfaithful.
SHARON: And, on top of that,
you allowed Amy's parents...
her friends, all the
people in your hometown...
believe you were
a loving husband,
desperate to find
his missing wife.
Well, I am desperate
to find my missing wife.
You say that,
but I'm wondering...
how you expect us
to believe you...
now that we know
you're a liar.
I didn't come
forward with my affair...
because I knew it would make
me look really, really bad.
But I don't care
about that anymore.
SHARON: I'm just trying
to get clear...
Just because l am not a murderer
doesn't make me a good guy.
I was a bad husband
to a great wife.
I broke the vow
that I made to her.
Those are pretty words,
Nick.
But what does that
really mean to you?
It basically means
that I was a con artist.
I met Amy Elliott
seven years ago.
I was this average guy
from an average place...
And I met a woman
who dazzled me.
And I wanted her
to love me...
so I pretended to
be better than I was.
When we got married,
I promised to be that guy.
That guy who,
who lives and acts...
and loves with as much passion
as she does.
But I failed her.
Instead of doing
what was right...
You talk like a man who believes
he can make amends to his wife.
Who believes his
wife is still alive.
Will you look at
that camera for me?
If she is out there, able to
hear and see you tonight...
what would you like
to say to her, Nick?
You're the best person
I've ever known.
And I've taken
myself to the woodshed...
for the way that
I've treated you.
And if you come back,
I promise...
I will spend every day
making it up to you.
I will be the man that I
promised you I would be.
Here.
SHARON: Regardless of
what you thought...
NICK: What does it say?
...I think
we can all agree...
Oh, my God.
You fucking killed it.
...there's more to him
than meets the eye.
They're going crazy for you.
They disliked me, they
liked me, they hated me.
And now they love me.
...a candor and an honesty
that's worthy of respect.
What is it?
I'm Sharon Schieber.
Good night.
Margo Dunne, this is a search
warrant for your property.
I usually ignore
tipline calls...
but a neighbor
was concerned about...
a strange man
around your woodshed.
Call Tanner.
Okay. Fuck!
Girlfriend's real cute,
Nick.
Is that what this is about?
I have treated
you more than fair...
throughout this
entire investigation.
I gave you the benefit of
the doubt over and over.
Every time you said
something stupid...
I thought,
"Maybe he's just stupid."
But I was wrong.
That's what this is about.
Are these the clubs
you don't play golf with?
None of that is mine.
None of this was
put here by me.
Those are nice clubs.
You got the makings
of a real man cave.
Everything just waiting
until the wife
goes away for good.
GO: Nick!
Hey, you can't do that!
Of course we can.
Amy, it's time to move on.
What can I do to help?
I need some time to think.
That's the last
thing you need.
Desi...
Twenty years,
you have kept me dangling.
Finally, last night, you came
to me, and you chose me.
Follow that instinct.
Don't trust the instinct that
left you beaten and homeless...
sleeping in your car,
fearing for your life.
I'm not gonna
force myself on you.
I understand what
you're saying, Desi.
I do.
I've been so mistreated
for so long.
I've forgotten how to behave.
I'll move in here
tomorrow...
and we'll work
it out together.
I just want you
to be you again.
TANNER: They only took
Margo to fuck with you.
She's not spending another
fucking second in there.
I'm gonna go in, and I'm
gonna tell them everything.
What?
We tell Boney very little.
Without a body,
without a murder weapon...
their only hope
is a confession.
So, you let them
do all the talking.
That way, we can
jump-start your defense.
The truth is my defense.
Recognize these?
Yes. It's Amy's
anniversary present to me.
Was that how she told you
she was pregnant, Nick?
Mommy, Daddy, baby,
and that made you real mad?
No.
Recognize this? Never seen
that before in my life.
It's Amy's diary.
We found this at
your father's house.
Is this your
wife's handwriting?
He's not a handwriting ex...
Looks like it.
Our experts
thought so, too.
Do you wanna play
a little true or false?
Sure.
"And then he brushes
the sugar off my lips
so he can taste me."
Yeah, that's true.
You thought
quinoa was a fish?
That is also true, yes.
She wanted to get pregnant,
you assaulted her.
I hit her?
No, never happened.
"Pushed," it says "pushed."
Absolutely not.
I never touched her.
She tried to buy a gun.
I doubt that,
but I don't know.
Shall I read the last entry?
Sure.
"This man may kill me."
In her own words,
"This man may kill me."
It's kind of
a convenient end note.
TANNER:
For future reference...
the truth, you are not
a handwriting expert.
Okay, I know.
BONEY: Judy's missing handle.
Big as a two-by-four, right?
Big as a club.
We found this day one,
in the fireplace
in your home office.
We didn't know
what the hell it was,
but fire in July?
We bagged it.
I've never seen
that before either.
BONEY: We just tested it.
Fire doesn't
erase blood, Nick.
So, finally,
Nicholas Dunne...
you're under arrest
for the murder of your wife.
Do not say another word.
What about my side?
Nick!
More coffee?
I'd love it.
Remember that time we skipped
school and drove to the Cape?
Oh, God, yeah.
Lobster right from the ocean.
This reminds me of that.
Never-ending holiday.
You're not bored?
Desi, how could I be bored?
You can discuss
quote Proust in French.
Nick's idea of culture
was a reality TV marathon...
with one hand
down his boxers.
I really have to get going.
But I will be back
just as soon as I can.
My keys.
Thank you.
Ow!
That's how the kids wear it.
Dunne?
You got one hell of a lawyer.
Hey-
Are you okay?
Yes. Are you?
Yeah.
Let's go.
What does this mean?
Well, you're out on bond.
You can relax at home
while we prep for trial.
Keep your head down.
Tanner, is there
any fucking lead on Amy?
I've got two of
my best guys on it.
She's air.
Come home, Amy.
I dare you.
Mr. Collings is home.
Hello, Mr. Collings.
I've missed you.
I've been thinking...
I don't wanna be without you.
Oh.
Stay with me.
And when all this dies down,
we'll go to Greece,
like you said.
Octopus and Scrabble?
How long do you
think until it's done?
Not long.
Six months for the trial.
Sentencing will be quick.
He'll appeal.
I can watch the rest
overseas.
Go slowly.
But I want it.
Don't rush.
Just do it.
Harder.
You fucking bitch.
DOCTOR: Don't you worry,
you're gonna
have lots of babies.
Her wounds are
consistent with rape.
There was semen present.
We'll make sure
it's a match.
Yeah, it'll match.
Thank you very much.
What do you think?
Are we pals again?
Now that I know you didn't
murder your wife, yes.
What do you think?
Kidnapping?
The story's insane.
She's on fairly
heavy painkillers.
It's okay.
I want to help.
FBI AGENT: Ms. Dunne, I know
what you've been through...
so we'll keep this
very brief.
Can you walk us
through what happened?
That morning,
the doorbell rang.
So normal.
I opened the door.
So strange.
Since high school,
he won't ever go away.
And I've just tried
to be nice to him.
Answer his letters.
Keep him calm.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I've encouraged him.
You can't blame yourself.
He pushed inside.
And he grabbed me.
But I got away,
and ran to the kitchen.
And he clubbed me.
I collapsed.
That club was actually the handle
to a Punch and Judy puppet.
Right.
Treasure hunt.
I'd hidden some
puppets at Go's...
Then how did Desi
have that handle?
I'd just found it.
It must have fallen off.
I...
was holding it
when Desi pushed in.
So, he got it from me.
About that woodshed...
He took me
to his lake house.
Tied me to his bed.
Back to the woodshed
real quick. Real quick.
When you went to place
the puppets there...
did you notice
that it was packed...
Lots of stuff.
Corresponding
to purchases made...
on credit cards in
your husband's name.
AMY: Nick and credit cards.
He buys, I nag.
I don't know, probably.
He hid a lot of stuff at Go's.
They're very close.
Now, may I go back to where I
was being held prisoner...
by a man with a history
of mental problems?
Please continue, Ms. Dunne.
Desi assaulted me that night.
Every night.
He tied me up like a dog.
And then, he'd punish me.
Starve me.
Shave me.
Sodomize me.
There were cameras everywhere.
Please find this.
Please find the tapes.
She slit his throat
with a box cutter.
How did she manage to get
a hold of a box cutter...
if he had her tied up
the whole time?
Can't you just be happy
your wife is home and safe?
Amy, we found your diary.
It contains many concerning allegations
of mental and physical abuse.
Well, it's the ugly truth.
Nick didn't want a baby.
He has a temper.
We had money problems.
But I love him.
Then why did you
try to buy a gun?
I'm sorry,
I feel myself fading.
If I could just
clarify one thing...
If this case had been left in
your deeply incompetent hands...
my husband would
be on death row...
and I'd be tied,
still, spread-eagle...
Ms. Dunne,
you've been very brave.
We're finished.
Now, I have to ask you...
do you feel safe going
home with your husband?
We prayed to God, and God
has answered our prayers.
Amy Dunne is home.
Now, I know there are a lot
of questions and concerns...
but for right now,
we wanna sit tight...
and just be
thankful and grateful...
for this miracle
on the Mississippi.
Excuse me.
Excuse us, folks.
WOMAN: We love you, Amy!
All right,
you can stop pretending now.
I'm not pretending.
You were perfect.
The Nick I saw on TV, that's
the Nick I fell in love with.
You do know I was
just telling you...
what you wanted
to hear, right?
That's how well
you know me.
You know me
in your marrow.
Okay-
You need to tell me
exactly what happened.
Take off your clothes.
I need to make sure
you're not wearing a wire.
You killed someone, Amy.
You're a murderer.
I'm a fighter.
I fought my way
back to you.
You killed a guy.
You slashed his throat
with a box cutter.
You went on
national television...
and begged for me
to save your life.
And I obliged.
But I want that Nick.
I'm leaving.
You really think
that's smart?
Shampoo.
Wounded, raped wife
battles her way
back to her husband...
and he deserts her.
They'll destroy you.
Neighbors will shun you.
And I'll make sure
that no one forgets
the pain you caused me.
I don't want anything to do
with your groupies outside.
Once they go...
I go.
Give it the night.
Sleep on it.
Was there ever a baby?
There can be.
Good night.
MAN: Hey, Nick!
Hello, handsome.
Crepe?
Sure.
ELLEN:
And when this spoiled, rich,
entitled little boy
couldn't have her...
You must be so proud.
It's been four hours.
Nick? Nick? What's next
for you and Amy?
Right now,
it's all about our marriage.
When two people
love each other and
can't make that work...
that's the real tragedy.
Kiss my cheek.
I can't believe
that fucking spider
is America's sweetheart.
She told me
she killed Desi.
Not self-defense.
Murder.
GO: Can't we get a wire?
NICK: That's not gonna work.
She told you once before.
Yeah, because she
had me strip naked,
and stand in the shower.
I swear, you two are
the most fucked-up people
I've ever known.
And I specialize
in fucked-up.
You and Amy
under the same roof?
You should pitch that
as reality television.
REPORTER:
Amy Dunne, and
the Miracle on the Mississippi.
AMY: Nick and I
have been through
some bad patches.
for supporting us in
our new life together,
for forgiving Nick.
Really, your encouragement
means the world.
Oh, she's good.
Amazing Amy and
the Humbled Husband.
The Real Housewives
of Branson.
Take care of
this guy, will you?
I can't believe
you're just leaving now.
You are not at risk anymore.
I'm the definition
of "at risk."
You got a book deal,
a Lifetime movie,
you franchised The Bar.
You may wanna thank her.
Just don't piss her off.
See you, guys-
Elvis has left Missouri.
She had to have
made a mistake.
We need to
check Amy's story,
piece by piece.
Nick, I can't do anything.
We had the national spotlight
on us, we stained the rug.
The case is with the Feds now,
they're done.
That doesn't mean
you have to be done.
It does.
What are you doing?
Couldn't sleep.
Come on...
let me tuck you back in.
You know you can
sleep with me, right?
Yeah, it's just...
I need more time.
I would never,
ever hurt you.
I do need you
to participate, though.
I need you to do your part.
Okay.
Everything you have heard
about my wife...
is a lie.
She is a calculating,
murderous psychopath.
And I have been complicit...
AMY: Nick!
Nick? Breakfast.
Honey?
We should hold hands.
Not the entire time,
but on and off throughout.
"So, Nick, how does it feel
to have your wife back?"
"lt's fantastic.
"How many people
are lucky enough...
"to get a second
chance at love?"
"Fantastic" is
a little flippant.
"Amazing"?
I need you to admit that
you got the credit cards...
and that you hid
all that stuff at Go's
and that you pushed me.
I'm gonna need those
three things to feel safe.
You have to own this, Nick.
Don't worry.
I know exactly what to say.
Nick.
What a beautiful home.
I so appreciate
you giving us this time, Nick.
You went on
national television...
and told people that
I murdered my wife.
I go where the story goes.
You implied that I
had carnal relations
with my sister.
I didn't use the "I" word.
I said you two were
"extremely close."
You and a panel of nitwits
diagnosed me as a sociopath.
Ice-breaker.
To go with your robot dog.
I'll go find Amy.
She's downstairs.
What is it?
It's for you.
Open it.
I don't need any
more gifts from you.
Open it.
I didn't touch you.
You didn't need to.
Bullshit.
That notice of disposal.
I have that.
You threw it out.
The notice, yes.
I want a blood test.
I want a paternity test.
I love tests.
You can teach those people
to hate me all you want.
I don't care.
I am leaving you.
I won't have to teach
your child to hate you.
He'll do that
all by himself.
You fucking cunt!
I'm the cunt you married.
The only time you
liked yourself...
was when you were
trying to be someone
this cunt might like.
I'm not a quitter.
I'm that cunt.
I've killed for you.
Who else can say that?
You think you would be happy
with a nice Midwestern girl?
No way, baby. I'm it.
Look, you're delusional.
You're insane.
Why would you
even want this?
Yes, I loved you.
And then all we did
was resent each other,
and try to control each other.
And cause each other pain.
That's marriage.
Now, I'm getting ready.
GO: I can't watch you
play house with that thing
for the next 18 years.
I can't just walk away.
You could get custody.
No, I won't.
And you know it.
It's gonna be my child.
I'm not gonna leave it.
You wanna stay.
I have a responsibility.
It's not about
what I want anymore.
You wanna stay with her.
You're breaking
my heart.
Go, you're my voice
of reason.
I need you with me on this.
Of course I'm with you.
I was with you
before we were even born.
NICK: We've been
through the darkness.
We've come out, united.
We communicate.
We're honest
with each other.
Right?
We're partners in crime.
And?
And?
We're gonna be parents.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, how exciting!
Thank you.
"What have we
done to each other?"
