It's time.
Hey, there.
Morning.
How are
you today?
Hey. What are you doing up?
Moo.
Is that daddy?
Hey, there, cowgirl.
She's a little
feisty today.
Babies are supposed
to be sleeping.
I'm too
hungry for my own good.
Yes.
I got to get ready.
Wrong day
to be forgetting stuff.
Listen, everyone is
telling you how lucky you are.
Don't screw this up.
All right. Jesus.
She go back to sleep?
Yep. Ate like a pig.
I know how lucky I am.
I ace this assignment,
department's wide open.
Get my own division someday.
You should see
those guys' houses.
Hello?
Why, yes.
Don't worry.
I will.
Yeah,
he's right here.
Hello.
Hoyt?
Uh, yes, sir.
You on your way
to roll call?
Yeah, I'm on my way
Out the door
right now.
Hoyt.
Uh, yes, sir?
Patrol fairies
go to roll call.
We don't
go to roll call.
OK, that's
good to know.
Listen, there's a coffee shop
at seventh and whitman.
See you there at 10:00.
Be in civvies.
Comfortable shoes.
Got a backup gun?
Something pocket-Sized?
Uh, no, sir,
I don't.
I got the department
issue Beretta.
Good, good.
Bring it. Cuffs too.
Going to be
in the office all day,
But who knows, maybe
we'll do some business.
We're an aggressive unit.
I know. Sir, that's
why I signed up.
And, you know,
I just want to say
Thank you for
giving me this...
What's wrong?
I feel like
it's the first day
Of football tryouts.
I mean, I wish it was
tomorrow already
So I'd know whether
I made his squad.
Listen, it's not tomorrow,
it's today.
I know it's going to work out.
You do?
Mm-Hmm.
Good morning, sir.
Uh, no,
thank you, ma'am.
Oh, get some chow in you
Before we go
to the office. My dollar.
Uh, thank you, sir,
but I ate.
All right, fine. Don't.
It's nice here.
May I read my paper?
I'm sorry, sir. I...
Thank you.
You know what? I'll get
something to eat.
No. Hell, no, you won't.
You fucked that up.
I'm trying to read my paper.
Please, shut up.
I sure wouldn't mind
not roasting
In a hot black and white
all summer.
Tell me a story, Hoyt.
Like, my story?
No, not your story.
A story.
Since you can't
keep your mouth shut
Long enough for me
to read my paper,
Tell me a story.
I don't think
I know any stories.
You don't know any stories?
All right,
I'll tell you a story.
This is a newspaper, right?
It's 90% bullshit,
but it's entertaining.
That's why I read it,
because it entertains me.
You won't let me read it,
so you entertain me
With your bullshit.
Tell me a story right now. Go.
Well, there was
a D.U.I. Stop...
A d.U.I. Stop?
Well, let me load up my guns.
A d.U.I.?! Oh, shit!
Listen, all right?
It's good.
We were on mid-Watch...
We?
Oh, me and Debbie...
Who's Debbie?
Uh, oh, I'm sorry.
Uh, Debbie Maxwell,
my training officer.
You had a female
training officer?
Yes, sir.
Ah, OK. OK.
All right. All right.
Ha ha ha! So what was she?
Black? White?
She was white.
Ah-Ha. Lick her license?
Uh, what?
A lick her license.
Was she a dyke? A lesbian?
Oh.
Is she any good?
Yeah, she's pretty good.
OK. Pretty good Debbie,
mid-Watch. Go.
All right. So it was
a real quiet night...
Boom!
Ha ha! You never know.
That's the point. Go.
All right, well,
it was a quiet night.
We're rolling
on vanowen. I'm driving.
This Acura,
just a beautiful car,
Comes out a side street,
All over the median.
In excess.
I light it up,
hit the wailer.
Guy drives on
like I'm invisible
For 10 blocks
before he pulls over.
All right?
Plates run clean,
So I field test
and arrest.
And I'm belting him
in our unit,
And Debbie's
tossing his car.
She calls me over
to the vehicle
And shows me a snub .38
and 2 shotguns
Fully loaded and locked.
No shit?
No shit. So, uh,
she calls our supervisor
And I keep searching.
I find 500 grams of meth
in the dash.
Turns out this d.U.I.
Is on bail
for distribution.
He's on his way
to smoke his ex-Partner
Before trial.
Boom.
We prevented a murder.
You go him. That's amazing.
It is.
That you could be out there
with a fine bitch for a year,
And the most entertaining story
that you can come up with
To tell me is a drunk stop.
But I don't believe you.
You tapped that ass,
didn't you?
Tell the truth.
You know you tapped that ass.
You put her in the backseat.
Bam! Code x.
Look, man, I got a wife.
You got a dick.
You do have a dick, don't you?
Yes.
OK, your dick lines up
Straight like that, right?
To the right of it
and to the left of it
Are pockets, right?
In those pockets are money.
Look in either one of them,
pay the bill.
Hey, grab that menu
off that window for me,
All right?
Get in. It's unlocked.
Just throw that
in the glove box.
This car is not
from the motor pool.
No, it's not.
Sexy, though, isn't it?
So where's the office?
Back at division?
You're in
the office, baby.
Going up.
Today's a training day,
officer Hoyt.
Show you around.
Give you a taste of
the business, you know?
I got 38 cases
pending trials,
investigation,
Another 250 on the log
I can't clear.
I supervise 5 officers.
That's 5 different
personalities.
You could be number 6
if you act right.
But I am holding no
hands, you understand?
I am not baby-Sitting.
You got today
And today only
to show me who
And what you're made of.
You don't
like narcotics,
Get the fuck
out of my car,
Go back to the office,
Get a nice, pussy
desk job, you know?
Chasing bad checks or
something. You hear me?
I hear you.
OK.
Why do you
want to be a narc?
I want to, um,
serve my community
By ridding it
of dangerous drugs.
Right. Right. But why
do you want to be a narc?
Ha ha ha. Uh, I want
to make detective.
There you go.
You can do it.
Stick with me.
You can do it.
Unlearn that bullshit
They teach you
at the academy, though.
Don't bring none
of that shit in here.
Shit will get you
killed out here.
I will do anything
you want me to do.
My niggah.
Roll your window down.
Start there.
Ha ha ha. See, you got to
hear the street.
You got to smell it,
you know?
You got to taste that
shit, feel it.
How's your Español?
Um...mas o menos.
Learn that shit,
brother.
Learn that shit.
That shit will get you killed.
These motherfuckers out here
plotting all kinds of shit
Behind your back.
Shit, man. You going to
teach me that old school,
Hard charging,
beat up everything that moves,
Rodney king shit?
We don't do that no more.
That day's dead, dog.
We don't roll
like that no more.
Now we use this.
Brain power.
These niggahs are
too strong out here anyway.
You think I'm crazy,
right? Huh?
I don't know what to think.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Good.
Good.
Ah...
How long have
you been married?
About a year.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You got
a kid, right?
That's right. A little girl.
Yeah. I got 4.
Boys.
You need a son,
you let me know.
I'll hook your old
lady up, you know?
I can't miss.
Can we not talk
about my family,
All right?
I respect that.
I'm married.
I got my queen, too.
I remember
what it was like
To have a pretty
young bride.
You probably
fuck her
Face to face,
don't you?
All right, man.
Let's just not talk about
my wife, all right?
Yeah, that's my point,
you see?
You're so in love,
The shit is coming
out of your eyes.
The day you bring
your old lady to the office
Is the day that you don't
make it back home.
You got to hide that love deep
inside you, you understand?
Otherwise, these maggots
out here on the street,
They'll find it.
They'll use it against you,
And they will chew you up...
Never wear that
wedding ring to work.
I'm serious about that.
All right.
All right. Thanks.
What's here?
Transactions.
You see that
salvatrucha zero head
Sitting over there
on the fence
Trying to act like
he's not slanging dope?
Yeah.
Yeah. That's my boy.
That's my boy neto.
The punk's only 17,
But he can kill
with the best of them.
He works for me.
Jesus, he's an...
He's an informer?
Teammate, you know?
I got eyes everywhere.
He gets to pedal
a little reefer,
Make a little cash
for the family.
He gives me
the head's up
When big things
are happening.
Big transactions.
boom. Boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom.
And you trust him?
Damn right I trust him.
I sprung his mom
from I.N.S. Detention.
Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.
Watch this.
That's right.
Come on down.
Come on. Look at it.
Sexy, isn't it?
That's right.
See the hand-To-Hand?
Yeah, I saw it.
I saw it.
All right. When was
the last time
You did

Uh, a couple weeks ago.
Good. You need practice.
They look like
college kids.
They'll get education today.
I want the Brady bunch

Shut up.
Too late for that.

I don't care
who gave it to you.
She could pick it up
in jail. What else you got?
Give me them cigarettes, too.
Give me, give me, give me,
give me, give me. Hey!
Control your suspect.
Miss, palms
on the glass.

I'll slap the taste
out of your mouth,
You understand me?
Put your face right up

Right there.
Now, what are you
doing down here?
You know this is a gang
neighborhood, don't you?
Ow, ow! Yeah, yeah!
You know it's
a gang neighborhood?
Then don't
come down here.
I see you

I'm going to
take your vehicle.
I'm going to
...make you walk home.
I'm going to let
the homeboys up the hill...
...Run a train

You know what a train

Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
All right, gentlemen.
Thanks for
your cooperation.
Let's go.
Safe your iron, son.

You were trained

Check that out.
It's a shitty dime.
See the small hairs,
Undeveloped seeds...
All the stems in it?
See how immature it is?
That's classic
brick-Pack Mexican.
That's garbage.
Let me see. Give me.
Yeah, it's old, too.
Shit is probably
from last year.
To be truly effective,
A good narcotics agent
must know and love narcotics.
In fact,
a good narcotics agent
Should have narcotics
in his blood.

What, are you going to
smoke that?
Nope, you are.
hell if I am.
Yeah? Yeah?
You're not?

Why, you a Mormon

You're a Jesus freak?
No, man. I'm not
losing my job.
This is your job.
I can't do that.
Smoke it.
This isn't a test.
Just take a hit.
No, man, listen.
I became a cop
To stop people
from using...
Yeah, yeah, blah,

It's not a review board
and it isn't cocaine.
Take a hit.
No, man.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah, right.
If I was a dealer,
You'd be dead by

You turn shit down

And the chief

A crisply

Talking about...
You know what?

What's up?
I can't do

It's your mess.
You clean it up.
Don't be calling me.
Hey...
Here's a joke, boy.
A man walks out of his house
on his way to work,
Sees this snail
lying on his porch.
So he picks it up,
chucks it over the roof
Into the backyard.
Snail bounces off a rock,
Busts its shell up
all to shit,
Lands in the grass.
Hmm? Snail lies there dying.
But the snail doesn't die.
And then after a while,
it can crawl again.
And one day the snail
up and heads back
To the front of the house.
And finally, after,
oh, about a year,
The little guy crawls
back on the porch.
Right then the man
walks out of his house
On his way to work.
He sees this snail again.
So he looks at it,
and he says...
"What the fuck is
your problem?!"
That's not funny.
That's not funny.
What you
laughing for then,
...If it isn't funny?
I don't know, man. I...
Hey, hey!
You figure that joke out,
You'll figure
the streets out.
Shit, there is
nothing to figure out.
That's just some
senseless bullshit.
Don't listen to him.
Yeah, well, I...
I already
figured them out.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, really?
Yeah.
You already
figured the streets out?
Yeah, well, it's...
It's all about
smiles and cries.
Put the drink down, man.
This motherfucker is
out of his mind.
Hey, hold on, Alonzo.
Hold on, hold on.
Smiles and cries.
Smiles and cries.
Smiles and cries.
I hear you.
Yeah, you got to...
You got to control
your smiles and cries,
Because that's
all you have,
And nobody can
take that away from you.
Oh, shit.
What you think, dog?
Hmm?
Think this greenhorn
can handle undercover?
You were just like him.
What?
Same silly-Ass look
and everything.
Saving the god damn world!
Yeah.
Yeah!
Yeah, now that's
some smiles and cries
For your ass.
Yeah. Shit lasted
about a week.

I got to get back
to the office.
Thanks for the snort,
dog.
Always good
to see you, brother.
Yeah.
Yes, sir!
Mm-Hmm. What you doing
later on?
Stay in the house,
save some cheddar.
I'm less than a year
away from my dream.
Philippine islands,

And I am never

That's right.
Let me go with you.
You're invited.
Aaugh!
Hey.
Open your eyes, man,

Boom! Come on, man,

Who the fuck are you?
I'm a cop, man.
Watch out.
Alright.
Don't shoot nobody.
Why don't you get
that beer in you, man?
That will give you ballast.
Oh, no.
For real.
Get that up in you, man.
You'll feel better.
Stop the car, man!

What's happening?
Oh, hey.
You're fucking dead!
OK, wait a minute.
Hold it. Hold it!
You, too,

And they're going to

Calm down. Calm down,

No, I'm not OK.
Look at my nose, man!
It's just a little
nosebleed.
Just put a little ice
on it, you're going to be fine.
What are you doing
out here anyway? Huh?
These pieces of shit,
they probably got aids,
You know? Why are you
not in school?
I was just going
to a ditch party...
You almost became a part
of the ditch party.
Now, you say
your cousins from where?
From Hillside Trece!
You fucking remember that, too!
Tell your cousins
to get your back,
All right?
Grab your bag
and go home right now.
Whoa, I need to get...
Go home right now!
We don't need
no statement. Go! Go.
Yeah, they're going to
fuck you up, iputo!
We're going to cut them loose?
What, do you want
to beat them up? Go ahead.
Get down. Protect
and serve, brother.
I got a punching bag
at home.
These guys should
be off the streets.
You hear that, homey?
You want to go home, or you
want to go to jail, huh?
What you think?!
Ahh. Got room for you
at the booty house.
You ever been
to the booty house?
Huh?
Big boys have you
grab your ankles, man.
Suck my dick, bitch!
I know people!
That's how it starts.
What about you, my man?
What you got?
You ain't got nothing?
No, man.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Where's your horn?
I have got no horn.
No?
Uh-Uh.
You got money, though.
Aw, you lied to me.
You lied to me.
Lucky I don't make you
eat that, dog.
Stand up, you. Stand up.
Stand the fuck up!
Yeah. Oh, shit, huh?!
Huh? Huh?
Turn around, sucker.
Turn around.
So you like raping
young girls, huh?
Hmm? You like to rape
young girls?
That's your m.O.?
No, no...
That's what you like,
isn't it?
You like to rape
young girls.
That's what you like
to do, right?
Don't lie to me.
You told me to "suck
your dick, bitch."
Isn't that what
you said to me?
Look at me.
You wanted me
to suck your dick.
That's what you said,
right?
That what you said? Hmm?
Didn't you say,
"suck my dick, bitch"?
Don't lie to me. That's
what... You keep telling me,
I'm a liar.
You didn't say,
"Suck my dick, bitch"?
That's not what
you said to me?
So I'm lying?
Am I lying?
No. Please. Please!
Where is it?
I can't even find it.
Let me see.
Pull your pants down.
Pull them down.
Which nut you want?
I'll leave you one nut.
Which one you want?
Make a decision.
Make a decision.
All right, all right.
Put your hands
on your head.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Uhh!
You're lucky I have
more pressing business.
I'd cut your fucking
dick off
And stick it right up that
little funky ass of yours,
Bitch!
Damn, I'm thirsty!
I want a beer.
What about you?
You want a beer?
I'm going to leave
you three to it, man.
Pussy-Ass bitch!
When I see you again, I'm going to
fuck your shit up, bitch!
You aren't going to
see shit coming, man!
I'll sneak up behind you
Like a
motherfucking ninja, man.
I'll crack your head open,
you fucking pig! Come on!
That girl's 14.
She all woman, though, man.
You tax that ass
for days, man.
Yeah, keep walking,

You want a beer?
No, I don't
want a beer, man.
No? You mad?
You want to book
that 60 bucks, huh?
Here. Go ahead.
Book it
into evidence, man.
Where are your suspects,
though?
You got to go back
and get the suspects.
I don't know where they are.
You let them go.
Oh, I let them go.
Yeah, you let them go.
They're...
Hey, man, you want
to run and gun, man,
Stay in patrol, OK?
This is investigations,
Alright?
Let the garbage men
handle the garbage.
We're professional
anglers, OK?
We go after
the big fish.
Chasing them
monkey-Strung
Crackhead motherfuckers
anyway! You know,
They'd have killed you
without hesitating.
That's why they belong
in prison.
For what?
They got beat down,
They lost their rock,
they lost their money.
Them eses from hillside
probably going to smoke them.
I mean, Jesus,
what more you want?
I want justice.
Is that not justice?
That's street justice.
What's wrong
with street justice?
Just let the animals
wipe themselves out.
God willing! Fuck them,
And everybody
who looks like them.
Unfortunately, it doesn't
work that way.
The good guys,
they die first, right?
The school kids and moms,
family men...
They the ones
catch the stray bullets
In the noodle.
To protect the sheep,
you got to catch the wolf,
And it takes a wolf
to catch a wolf.
You understand?
What!?
I said you protect the sheep
By killing
the motherfucking wolves.
No, you didn't hear me.
You listening,
But you didn't hear me.
All right, whatever.
Yeah, whatever.
Whatever the fuck ever.
Well, let me
ask you this.
When do you
lock anybody up?
I mean, it seems you're pretty
busy keeping people out.
What the fuck
you talking about?!
You don't know what you're
talking about, Betty Boop!
Got nothing but shit
between your ears.
Shit, they build jails
because of me!
Judges have handed out
over 15,000 man-Years
Of incarceration time based
on my investigations, OK?
My record speaks for itself.
How many felons
have you collared?
Huh?
Yeah, I rest my case.
Oh, look, man, I'm not
smoking crack, all right?
Glad to hear that. Just
put it in the glove box.
Put the $60
in there, too.
That will come in handy
later on.
We'll use it like... Like
a credit card or something.
Hey, no matter what I say,
you did the right thing.
Reminds me
of when I was out there
Chasing down bad guys,
rocking their world.
That was some pretty amazing
shit you did back there, Hoyt.

Hey, I noticed

That choke hold,

I thought that was
a no-No procedure, boy.
I was getting
my ass kicked.
And you did
what you had to do, right?
You did
what you had to do.
That's right.

There's this...
serial burglar, and, uh,
Chasing him

Captain's riding my ass
the entire time.
Sentencing was today.
judge is female.
That's right.
Landers.
Yeah, I know Landers.
She's a sharp lady.
No?
so before
the hearing,
Guy gets hold of
some peanut butter,
Packs his ass crack
with it...
What?
Then he's standing tall
before the bench,
And he's waiting
to give his statement.
So he shoves
his hand down his pants,
Comes out with a gob
of extra-Chunky Jif.
Bailiffs won't
come near him.
Now he's... Now he's looking
the judge right in the eyes
And licks his fingers clean.
Holy shit.
So the judge says, uh,
"Oh, this poor man's insane.
He can't go to prison."
Orders him to psychiatric.
She fell for it.
Yeah. That's because
she's so fucking smart.
Time she found out
it was sandwich spread,
The order was signed,
the guy's been transferred.
Proceedings closed.
Yeah, closed.
That prick will do 6 months
in the puzzle factory,
Then they'll call him normal
and let him loose.
Never, ever do
a day in prison.
Yeah, give him
credit, though.
Shit, he worked
the system,
Deserves
his freedom.
Yeah? Think so?
Or not.
I'll tell you what.
I'm going to find
this guy on the street...
And I'm going to do him.
You better take his
bullets from him, Stan.
Shit.
ahh...
Alonzo...
Heard you had an expensive
weekend in Vegas.
How did you ever
screw up so bad?
Nothing. It's nothing.
Forget it.
You know, I didn't know.
It's not my town.
I'm not omniscient.
the Russians don't
care if you have a badge.
They'll whack you.
You ought to hop

Why?
It's an easy fix.

Look, the guy's
A high-Security risk

Off the radar, you?
I'm just taxing him,

OK?
Well, it's your call.
I do not want you

All right, you ready?
Kiss me, baby.
One...
Oh!
yeah?
You all right?
Yeah.
I got to give you
one more, though.
Do it.
Ah, fuck!
All right, listen.
It's not what you know,
It's what you can prove.
OK, here's the scenario.
Mark and Paul,
you kicked the door.
Jeff's
the first one through.
Roger opens fire...
Hits Jeff twice, right?
Fuck.
What's the matter,
one go through?
Shit!
Yeah, man.
You shot him.
You fucking
shot me, man!
All right, all right.
You'll get a medal.
Don't worry about it.
Get me an ambulance!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
You want to go to jail
or you want to go home?
All right, here's
the scenario, all right?
Let me quarterback
this thing.
Mark, Paul,
you kicked the door in.
Jeff's
the first one through.
Roger opens fire...
Bang, bang.
Hits Jeff twice.
Our new guy, Hoyt,
He's in second,
Drops roger with
some fine shotgun work.
Who shot roger?
New guy...
Came in spraying.
Paul?
Boot shot him.
What did
you guys see?
Hoyt blasted him.
Yeah, fuck Hoyt, OK?
Ambulance time.
Done.
Paul, call them up.
Shots fired.
Officer down.
Repeat, officer down.
Congratulations, son.
You're going to get a medal
of valor for this.
I didn't shoot him.
A roomful of cops
said you did.
But I didn't.
You did.
A Los Angles
police department
Narcotics officer
was killed today
Serving a high-Risk
warrant in echo park.
Give me the bitch.
L.A.P.D. Spokesperson
Said the officer
Is survived...
By his wife
and infant child.
Shit gets deeper.
You get the picture?
Yeah, I got the picture.
Hey, hey, hey!
That is the second time
you pointed a gun at me!
There will not
be a third.
God damn, boy!
That's what I'm
talking about, Jake.
My niggah. Are you all
watching this? That's it.
It'd be my pleasure to put
a hydra shock in that melon.
Hey, hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
no, but I'm
going to be cool.
Now drop
the fucking gun now!
You want to shoot me,
Paul, go ahead,
But I'm taking
him with me.
I'm going,
Alonzo.
This motherfucker is
a fed, man.
No, he is no fed.
He's just a choir boy
With a heart that got
the drop on all you fools.
Listen, everybody just
take a deep breath,
And just diffuse this thing.
You hear me, Jake?
You can't pull
this shit on me, man.
I didn't
sign up for this.
OK, OK.
I know you're angry.
Everybody,
just put your guns down.
Hell, no.
no, no, no, no...
Choir boy first.
Hey, listen to me.
Put the guns down!
That's an order.
Put them down!
Use your ears
and you hear me, Jake.
Sometime we got to take
this shit all the way.
It's not like we do this
every day, all right?
It's just the nature
of the business.
Now, no one will
ever ask you again
To pull the trigger if you
don't want to, all right?
Hey, mark, where are
you transferring to?
S.I.S.
S.I.S.
Detective.
You give me 18 months,
I give you a career.
We make the big
seizures, Jake.
We make
the big arrests.
But if you're
in my unit,
You got to be in it
all the way
Or not at all,
you understand me?
I mean, I thought
you were man enough
To handle this shit.
I guess I was wrong.
decorated officers
Says that you're
the shooter, OK?
The investigators
are going to want to pull...
... a tube of your blood
to check for intoxicants.
What are they going to find,
Jake? Do the math.
You been smoking P.C.P.
All day, haven't you?
Huh? Remember?
You've been
planning this all day.
I've been planning it
all week, son.
You talk that crazy shit,
I'll make sure your blood
Gets to the lab.
You want to walk your little
baby nuts around the block,
You won't make it
to the corner,
But if you're cool...
If you're cool...
You're a hero.
You're a virgin shooter
above suspicion.
Alonzo,
there's 2 shots left
In that other stinger.
We need to just kill
your boy right now,
And say roger got him
coming through the door.
No, we are
killing nobody.
This is a good man
right here.
He's got the magic eye.
I can feel it.
Just had a little
freak out, that's all.
We all been there.
No, I say he's cool.
And I say nobody is
going to hurt him.
But you do have
a decision to make, Jake.
because in about
This place is going to be
overrun with blue suits.
So why don't you
please go outside,
Clear your head...
Or shoot me.
hey, Paul.
You're dead,
motherfucker!
You hear me?
You're fucking dead!
Yeah.
Ha, that's right.
Well, lay off that rice.
All right.
Yeah, just make sure that
bathtub is clean, homey.
All right?
All right. Later.
You all right?
It behooves you
not to dick around
On this one.
Justifiable homicide
in the line of duty, OK?
Now what happened...
What happened was murder...
And armed robbery.
Oh, wait. We... We had badges,
so it's different?
Oh, son, open your eyes.
Can't you see? Huh?
That man was your friend,
And you killed him
like a fly.
come on.
My friend, huh?
Yeah.
Tell me why.
Because he knows
my first name?
Son, this is the game.
I'm playing his ass.
That's my job.
That's your job.
Roger sold dope to kids.
The world is a better
place without him.
Hey, this man was
the biggest major violator
In Los Angles.
I watched that cocksucker
operate with impunity
For over 10 years,
and now I got him.
This shit is chess.
It isn't checkers.
What you think we going to do?
We going to... We going to roll up
in a black-And-White, huh?
Slap the cuffs on him.
"You're under arrest."
That's a high roller, dog.
Take the money.
Hey, man, I already told you,
I'm not going to take that.
I'm not going to take that.
OK, don't. Just burn it,
barbecue it,
Fish fry it.
I don't give a fuck,
But the boys will
feel better about it.
Fuck their feelings.
Jake, you're
not making them feel
Like you're
part of the team.
The team?
You guys are fucking insane.
All right.
I'll go back to the valley.
I'll cut parking tickets,
you know?
God.
It... It can't be like this.
It is this way, man.
I'm sorry I exposed you
to it, but it is.
It's ugly,
but it's necessary.
I became a cop
to put away drug dealers,
The poisoners, the criminals,
not to be one.
You sound just like me,
And I know what
you're going through.
I know what
you're feeling.
You're scared.
I'm not scared.
Yes, you are.
You're terrified.
Everybody goes through
that the first time.
I went through it.
The sooner you can match
what's in your head
With what's going on
in the real world,
The better
you're going to feel.
In this business,
You got to have
a little dirt on you
For anybody
to trust you,
And when all this
is behind you,
There's going to be
a whole other world
That opens up for you.
I walk a higher path, son.
I can give you the keys
to all the doors.
What are you talking about?
My guys are pretty good,
but they're not leaders.
They're clowns.
You're a leader.
You want my job?
You got it.
You want to lock up
poisoners?
This is the best place
to do it.
But you got to just,
you know, take your time.
You make detective.
You play the game.
You grow wise, and then
you can change things,
But you got to change them
from the inside, son.
Let's go downtown
to the station.
You talk to my guy Stan,
And he'll walk you through
What you got to say
to the DA. Guys, OK?
OK.
What the hell we doing now?
An informant of mine is
up in chino.
I promised I'd take care
of his family for him.
I bring them some food,
you know, stuff like that.
Got to help out the family.
Believe it or not,
I do try to do some
good in the community.
It was, like,
right there, right?
Just right there.
What's up, dog?
You know where

What the fuck

All right.
What's up, punk?

Kitchen's this way.

With divas of dance 2000.
That sounds exciting.

Nah. It's just we

Alonzo's taking a shit.
Go ahead. Take a seat.

There is nothing

What are you

You ask me, homes...
But that's just,

Wait, where you going?
Where you going? Huh?
It's your deal.

If you don't believe me,
you can count it yourself.
Alonzo pulled off
a miracle, eh?
Times are tight.
Scared up a lot of cash.
Who did he jack, homes?
I don't know.
He jacked roger.
Blasted

Alonzo, homes, I think
he's a low-Down, dirty,
Ruthless Vato, eh,
but I like that, homes.
I like that.
no, that's why I
never shake his hand, homes.
He don't respect nada.
You know what
the money's for?
Alonzo,
he's a hothead.
Last week in Vegas,
Some Russian
starts talking shit,
And Alonzo,
he just snapped.
Beat his ass to death.
Well, turns out

He's a somebody.
Now, Alonzo...
He's into the Russians
for a million.
How do you know that?
They gave Alonzo
till tonight to pay up,
But his name's still
on their list, huh?
Nobody thought he could
get cash that big.
Good thing he got
his blood money,
because there's
a crew on standby.
If he don't turn up
downtown with the cash
By midnight, and
not a minute after...
Whew, your Vato...
He's dead.
