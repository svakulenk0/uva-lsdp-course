'Now he had become
'the still centre of that
spinning wheel of misfortune.
'The world turned round him,
leaving him miraculously untouched.
'The croupier had reached his goal.
'He no longer heard
the sound of the ball.'
'To begin with, he was Jack Manfred.'
- Now, then.
- I want a job, Giles.
I see. Well...
let me tell you
a little about our operation.
We like personality authors.
People the public recognises.
Celebrity's what sells books.
You can always find somebody
to do the writing.
What we need is the face.
Then the concept.
Right now I'm looking
for a soccer novel.
Something where a tycoon buys a
lousy team, takes it to the top.
Seven-figure transfer fees.
Corruption all down the line.
Violence on and off the pitch.
Steroids.
You got any concepts?
It could be a thug story.
I'll tell you what,
why don't you think about it?
Couple of pages.
With plenty of sex, of course.
Fiona!
Interesting, Giles.
I will think about it.
Let me give you
three words of advice, Jack.
Don't give up. Stick with it.
Who persists, wins. That's my motto.
Write, write, write.
'And Jack had three words for Giles.
'Go fuck yourself.
'Jack knew something was wrong.
'He'd forgotten Giles' advice,
Giles said three words.'
'Nobody around.
Leave a message after the beep.'
'Jacko,
if you're there, pick up.
'I want to talk to you.
It's important.
'Jacko,
I've got some news for you.
'Come on, Jacko.'
- Yeah, Dad, it's me.
- 'How's it going? '
- Good, yeah.
- 'Found a job yet? '
- No.
- 'I've got something for you.'
In London.
I've been chatting with some friends.
Now, do you know
the Golden Lion casino?
'They're looking for a dealer.'
Yeah, that's not
what I wanna do, Dad.
I know you don't like
taking my advice...
No, it's not that.
'Listen, I've set this up for you.'
You call the Golden Lion
and ask to speak to Mr Reynolds.
That's the manager.
I don't know him personally
but I have spoken to his boss.
'Now, don't say no, Jacko.
Give yourself a break.'
All right, Dad.
Yeah, I'll think about it.
Reynolds at the Golden Lion.
Yeah. All right, Dad.
Yes. I'll call him.
'You do that. That's my boy.'
So how are you doing, Dad?
Great. Just started a new company.
Solid financing. It's good.
'Jacko,
you know I love you, don't you? '
- Yeah. I know that.
- 'Don't let yourself down.'
- I won't.
- 'I'll keep in touch.'
Goodbye, Dad.
It was unbelievable.
I was in the room.
Uh-huh. Blackjack.
See you then, bye.
Sorry to have kept you.
What'll you have?
'No. Jack knew
it still wasn't quite right.'
I wanna fuck
the whole world over!
Ha!
'He had just one word for Giles.'
David Reynolds. The manager.
- Sit down, John.
- Jack.
You've been recommended
by the management here.
They knew your father.
He's a bit of a reputation,
hasn't he?
- Has he?
- In any case, I understand
you've had previous experience
in South Africa.
You'll find the rules here
a little different.
Before we start,
have got a police record?
- No.
- What school did you go to?
- I was at Bedales.
- Oh.
I don't think I know that one.
Private, I suppose.
There's three types of casino
in the UK.
High volume, small action
and middle of the road.
That's us. OK, Charlie.
- Do you have a salon prive?
- We tried.
Wasn't enough business.
Punters like company.
'Welcome back, Jack.
'To the house of addiction.'
Thanks, Charlie.
Right. Let's see you
handle the chips.
I assume the serial numbers on
the bowl and wheel correspond.
- We check every two days.
- Why not every day?
Procedure here.
Right, sort the chips.
Go.
Good.
Right. Now pay me out 1800 in 25s.
Very good.
OK. Let's have a look
at your Blackjack.
Too many.
What's the count?
Minus nine.
I make it minus eight.
Minus nine.
What makes you so sure?
It's the rule.
Always stand by your first count.
The odds are you're right.
Good call.
- You want me to check?
- I said, good call.
'It had taken him...
'45 minutes, but Jack
now had Mr Reynolds' number.
'The man couldn't count.'
Right. Just let me
run through a few things.
As a dealer, you never gamble.
Not anywhere.
And we'll need your picture.
- What for?
- For the database.
It's accessed by every
casino in the country.
It's the same system for punters.
- I don't gamble.
- Ever?.
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
Huh. Next point.
Friendships between croupiers
inside or outside the casino
are discouraged.
Relationships with
females working here
are expressly forbidden.
We had the same rule in Sun City
but it was impossible to check.
This isn't South Africa.
We'd know, because someone
would report it.
- Believe me, someone always does.
- Does know, or does report?.
What if I knew something like
that and didn't report it?.
We'd know. There are
no secrets in this casino.
- And you'd be punished.
- How?
First offence, verbal warning.
Second offence, written warning.
That one's filed and sometimes
copied to the Gaming Board.
My discretion.
Third offence,
you'd be sacked on the spot.
You'd never work in a casino
in this country again.
And there's another rule.
You're forbidden to talk
to or recognise a punter
outside the casino.
If you see someone
who's gambled here,
even casually on the street,
you must ignore him or her.
Not married, are you?
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.
She's not in the...
not in the gaming business, is she?
- No.
- Good.
This is our crow's nest.
I'm showing you it now,
but you'll never see it again.
Very impressive.
We have tapes here
that go back six months.
Here, let me show you something.
See that?.
Six weeks ago.
Dealer missed it.
Guy up here missed it.
I watch these tapes after hours.
Nothing gets by me.
Lady's in jail now.
It's easier to take ten million
pounds from a bank
than to take one penny
from this casino.
Right. Well, as soon as you get
your licence, you can start.
- Fine.
- So...
Are you planning to make
a career in casino work?
'And end up like you? '
I... I just want a job.
You're not the usual type
we get in here.
'Mr Reynolds was right. It was true.'
-
- Excuse me.
'Jack was up above the world.
'A writer looking down
on his subject.
'A detached...'
I can't talk about that just now.
'..voyeur.'
I'm with somebody. They can wait.
I'll be home at the usual time.
Don't get married, Jack.
Casino work doesn't mix
with house and garden.
- Any questions?
- Yeah. What's the salary?
'The casino paid its staff
monthly in arrears.
'He would have to wait six weeks
for his first cheque.
'He needed money now.'
So, what kind of deal
are you looking for?.
What's the book price?
That's not relevant.
Old car like this.
Depends on the condition.
'The car was a gift
from Jack's father.
'That's to say,
Jack Sr gave it to him
'before the bailiffs arrived.'
And this ain't exactly
what you call mint.
How about 1500?
- How about 500?
- What?.
How about we split the difference?
Is that your idea of arithmetic?.
I'm not a mathematician.
I'm in business.
'He suddenly wanted to be rid of it.
'Hang on tightly, let go lightly.
'Jack imagined people
reading his book.
'One day he would
get into their heads.
'Play with their imaginations.
'Test their feelings.
'He would tell them, you have
to make the choice in life.
'Be a gambler, or a croupier.
'And then live with your
decision, come what may.'
'Marion saw life differently.
'She was a romantic.
And thought he was, too.'
'You voted for them
'and now you can hear them every
day between nine and ten
'here on Classic FM.'
I couldn't resist them.
You mean I won't resist them.
No.
I'm not ready for you.
There's some vodka in the freezer.
- You want me drunk?
- I won't take that long!
Jack.
Wow.
You really are a beautiful woman.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?.
Turn around.
You're all I desire.
- Where did you get it?.
- I sold the car.
You shouldn't have done that.
I know what it meant to you.
I owe you for the rent.
It's only a car. I can get another.
- Take it back.
- No.
Till you sell your book.
Marion, let's face the truth.
Nobody is gonna publish it.
Of course they are.
You just have to be patient.
I'm betting on you.
I'm not much of a bet.
You are to me.
Come into my world.
You're my prisoner.
I've got something to tell you.
- I wanna hear it.
- I've got a job.
- What job?
- In a casino.
As a croupier. Dealer.
How did you land that?.
It came my way. 450 a week.
What did you do? Walk in and
say, I want to be a croupier?.
- Don't you need training?
- I had training.
In the Republic.
You were a croupier there?
You never told me that.
I thought you just knew
some gamblers.
- I start Monday week.
- 450 a week?
I've never earned that in my life.
You're an enigma, you are.
A fucking enigma.
'I'm not an enigma.
Just a contradiction.'
You sold the car.
You've got a job.
What's the third thing?
Tell me.
There's no third thing.
Don't be superstitious.
I love you, Jack. You know that.
'And he half-loved Marion.
And she knew that, too.'
You trying to read my palm?
You've got such beautiful hands.
'The hands of a conjurer,
a woman told him once.
'Or a cardsharp.'
D'you work round here?
My office is in Shanghai.
- What do you do?
- I'm an arms dealer.
So, what line of work
are you in, then?
I'm an undertaker.
Really?
Place your bets,
please.
- Jack Manfred.
- Jack Manfred. Table three.
And you have a new dealer.
Thank you.
'Usual bunch.
'They didn't know Jack,
but he knew them.'
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Where's the other fellow?
Where's Geoff?
- Where's Geoff?
- He's been re-assigned, sir.
Let's hope you know
how to do you job.
In fives.
Change.
What aftershave are you using?
'Never converse with the punters.
It slows things down.'
Money down.
'Speed is volume.
Volume is profit for the casino.
'Aim at 40 spins an hour.'
Place your bets, please.
No more bets. Thank you.
'Ooh, the scab.
'Come in with three grand cash,
no questions asked.
'Launder it by getting a
casino cheque when you cash in.
'Jack wondered why
Mr Reynolds permitted it.
'There was no profit
in it for the casino.'
Place your bets, please.
'Or was there? '
Blackjack.
'A wave of elation came over him.
'He was hooked again.'
Place your bets, please.
'Watching people lose.'
New dealer.
- Evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.
Jack.
Good work.
Keep it up.
Colour change.
Place your bets, please.
'Don't give me that sob story.'
'That's a lie.'
'You've been secretly
seeing Charlie for years.'
'Stop it!'
'I won't.'
I'm Bella.
Jack Manfred.
Hi, Jack.
Welcome to the cesspit.
Is it that bad?
How do I look?
'Like trouble, Bella.'
You look fine.
Tits in a uniform. Punters love it.
Your usual, sir.
Thank you, sir.
'50 quid for a Diet Coke.
'Waitresses were the
true winners in a casino.
'The only members of staff
allowed to accept tips.'
Thank you, Jack.
Enjoy yourself, Mr Tchai.
'On a good night they could get
- Good evening, Mr Tchai.
- Evening.
Mr Tchai always likes
to sit at that table.
And only with Bella.
Does he win?
He's a good customer.
'A good customer
is a consistent loser.
'But is that what he meant?. '
- Where d'you live, Jack?
- Over the river.
- You got transport?.
- No.
I'm going over the river.
I'll give you a lift if you like.
Nice one. Thanks.
So how d'you feel -
your first night on the job?
Bet you're on a high.
- Nice car.
- She's my baby.
How long have you worked
at the casino?
Coming up to two years now.
But I was away for six months.
Looks like you've done pretty well.
Not bad.
I have other interests, of course.
Listen, I'm off to
a little watering hole.
Have a few drinks. Relax.
- Want to join me?
- No thanks.
I'm gonna go home.
I need my eight hours.
I bet you five to one
you won't get any sleep.
You've got to unwind
in this job, Jack,
or it'll kill you.
- I mean that.
- Some other time.
- What time is it?.
- No idea.
- How did it go?
- Yeah. Fine.
You're shaking.
- What is it?.
- It's just tension.
- It'll go.
- Poor baby.
This'll relax you.
- I loved it blonde.
- Look, it's only hair.
I haven't changed.
When you come home, I'm asleep.
When I leave home, you're asleep.
Mmm.
Bye.
I'll see you in my dreams.
Change.
Money down.
Place your bets, please.
Two, six, 13.
Two, six, 13.
'Jack could see this woman
was an experienced gambler.
'Professionals always place bets
through the croupier.
'That way there are no comebacks.'
One, five, 16.
And the neighbours.
One, five, 16 and the neighbours.
No more bets. Thank you.
Eight seven five.
Place your bets, please.
- Two, six, 13.
- Two, six, 13.
- Two, six, 13.

- Orphans.
- Orphans by five.
One, five, 16 and the neighbours.
One, five, 16 and the neighbours.
No more bets. Thank you.
That's a late bet.
What are you talking about?.
No. You've won with the chips
you placed earlier,
but the bet on 34 was a late bet.
I put it all together.
I'm afraid not, sir.
Look...
Is there a problem?
This croupier is accusing me
of cheating.
Do you think I cheated?
In my opinion, it was a late bet.
I think we should talk, sir,
away from the table.
No. I won. I want to be paid.
Pay the gentleman.
In full.
Now.
We'd better talk
in my office.
-  Why?
- We paid out this time,
but you won't be welcome here again.
- You bastard!
- On your way, please, sir.
I'm sorry, madam.
We're not allowed to accept
gratuities in the UK.
It's different in South Africa.
- You know where I'm from.
- I've lived there.
Well, thank you anyway.
'Bright woman, he thought.
She knew the rule of gold.'
Place your bets, please.
'Quit when you're ahead.'
Matt, listen. There's something
I've got to say to you.
I saw you cheating.
What the fuck are you
talking about?.
That Greek guy at the end.
You paid him out 25s, not 10s.
You got it wrong, Jack.
I don't cheat.
I'm not gonna report it.
- What are you, a fucking cop?
- If you do it again, I will.
I don't get you. Even if
it was true, which it isn't,
what the fuck difference
would it make to you?
If the supervisor knew I saw
and didn't report it,
I'd lose my job
and I can't afford that.
Oh, so it's Mr Clean.
Wise up, Jack.
This whole business is bent.
The casino's nothing but legal theft
and that's OK - it's the system.
Half the punters who come here
are using stolen money.
Drugs money.
They haven't even earned it.
We earn our money.
I'm on your side, Jack.
I don't need an enemy.
You're talking about complicity.
I don't even know what that means.
I'm talking about
not rocking the boat.
'Matt was an escape artist.
'Like Jack's father.'
OK. Now, let's unwind.
Hey, Andros.
This is Jack.
- Hello.
- How you doing?
- Blackjack.
- One blackjack and...
- Drink?
- Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Vodka straight coming up.
- Who are these guys?
- A few drug dealers.
Mostly people that work
in the casino business.
- And the girls?
- Just girls.
Blackjack. Vodka straight.
- Does Bella come here?
- The bitch? No.
Matt, you want in?
Yeah, why not?.
Jack, join us?
No thanks.
- I won't report you.
- I don't gamble.
You don't gamble. But do you smoke?
Sometimes.
How about now?
- Same again, yeah?
- Coming up.
'Marion, I'm on my way.'
All right, lads. Divvy up.
Listen, I'm gonna get off.
I need to sleep.
Loosen up. If you don't,
this job'll get to you.
Pressure's too much. Believe me.
- It'll break you.
- "The world breaks everyone.
"And afterwards many are strong
at the broken places."
Ernest Hemingway.
Wasn't he the one who shot himself?
Where have you been?
I've got to give evidence
in court at nine.
Don't play the policewoman
with me, Marion.
Take that back!
Fucking take that back!
Yeah, I take it back.
You're not in the police any more.
You're a store detective.
Are you drunk?
Probably.
This fucking job's getting to you.
You haven't written
a fucking word lately.
D'you have to swear all the time?
That's my poor upbringing.
I didn't go to private school.
I haven't got any class.
I wanna live with a writer.
Not a fucking croupier.
I don't even know
what the word means.
Croupier.
Marion, stop this.
What do I mean to you?
I want to know.
Tell me.
You're my conscience.
Haven't you got a conscience
of your own?
Fuck. Shit!
No. It's not the one. Thank you.
Fancy a drink after work?
What are you doing here?
You know the rules.
- I don't finish till nine.
- Shit. I'm on at nine.
That's our life now, isn't it?.
# Show me the way to go home
# I'm tired
and I want to go to bed
# I had a little drink
about an hour ago... #
Thinking of going back?
Oh, my God. Hello.
You know what?.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
It's against the rules.
Dealers are forbidden
to talk to punters.
What are the odds
of you being seen with me?
Impossible to calculate.
It's a coincidence.
You know, there's a casino
in this hotel.
I'm not really much of a gambler.
I just like this bar.
- First visit to London?
- No.
I come every couple of years.
I always plan to stay, but...
I'm from Cape Town originally.
I was born in the Transkei.
- On the Wild Coast.
- Near the casino.
In the casino.
There's a coincidence -
my father used to gamble there.
Your father?.
I loved the atmosphere.
But it destroyed my mother.
- The debts?
- And the lies.
Gamblers are born liars.
And superstitious.
It's like witchcraft.
That's Africa.
There's an African
in all of us, isn't there?
We all came from Africa supposedly.
Do you believe in astrology?
Absolutely not.
But then I'm a Gemini.
Geminis don't believe in astrology.
You know, you don't strike me
as a typical croupier.
Ah, I'm not married.
I just wear it to keep the flies off.
Look, I have to go.
Let me pay for this.
- Absolutely not.
- Toss you for it.
I don't gamble.
I know this is verboten,
but if you feel like a chat,
or maybe dinner,
give me a call.
I'll understand if you don't.
But I hope that you do.
'Jack started to dress
for the casino at home.
'A man in love with his uniform.
'Like a musician in his tuxedo
'going to the concert hall
on public transport.
'Eager to perform.'
No more bets. Thank you.
Animal!
'The croupier registered disgust.'
This gentleman's accidentally
coughed on the chips.
'The writer made a note.'
Agnes.
'Good scene for the book.'
Take these chips
off the table for me.
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
Don't worry about it.
See you, Jack.
Yeah, see you.
Jack, d'you want a lift?.
No. I'm OK, thanks.
Maybe some other time.
I'll take you up on that.
Hey, you don't recognise me?
You had me barred, you little worm.
If I remember rightly,
you got yourself barred.
No, it was you, you shit.
Jack!
Jack! Come on, leave him.
Jack, You don't want
the police here. Come on.
Jack!
He won't cheat again.
You're shaking.
It's nothing.
Just tension.
Fuck!
Oh, shit.
It's funny, isn't it.
If that bloke hadn't come over,
you wouldn't be here now.
I hate cheats.
All men are cheats.
Are they?
Fools.
I spent a year on the game.
Don't worry. I'm clean as a whistle.
I only did S and M.
No blowjobs. No screwing.
Why did you stop?
Got scared.
Yeah. I can imagine.
Can you?
Anyway, I'm happy being a dealer now.
At least the punters keep
their hands to themselves,
even if the other dealers don't.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Well, it is.
But at least I know where I am.
I've been watching you work.
You're good.
Too fucking good for that place.
I despise the job.
If you hate it so much,
why d'you do it?.
Jack suddenly had the feeling
that he was transparent.
That Bella could see through him.
- You've got a guilty look.
- We broke the rules.
'He hadn't meant to say that.
She'd caught him unawares.'
You're different from the others.
'Careful. This liaison, forbidden in
the casino family, was incest.'
Not like Matt, you mean.
Now there's a real shit.
Don't get friendly with him.
D'you know what he said to me once?
"I wanna fuck the whole world
over. That's my mission."
Stupid little shit.
'Thank you, Bella.
'Jack could hear Matt saying it.
'"I want to
fuck the whole world over.
'"It's my mission."
'Eureka. Jack had struck gold.
'He'd found a protagonist
for his book.
'Little Matt.
'Chapter one.'
I look like shit.
- Rough day?
- Rough life, Jack.
- Hi. I'm Pat.
- Hello.
See you, boys.
- What happened to Bella?
- I'll tell you later.
Change.
What has happened to Bella?
What's happened to Bella?
She's been re-assigned.
'Not re-assigned.
Just written out of the story.'
Good evening.
Hundreds.
Change. 1,000.
'This was no coincidence.'
Too many.
'Did she think he'd bring her luck? '
Can I get anything for you?
'Why had she come? '
Too many.
'Did she want him to help her win? '
Change.
'He knew how to fix it for her.'
'His father had taught him the trick.
'The casino wouldn't spot it,
'but Jack was wary of the punters.'
'He could see Mr Tchai was counting.
'He couldn't risk it.'
'She wasn't wearing her ring.
Odds on she'd sold it.'
Thank you. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
'Thank you, she said.
For what, Jack thought.
'He ought to thank her.'
Pretty woman.
'Jani de Villiers
had just entered his book.'
Place your bets, please.
Yeah.
- How's it going, Jacko?
- 'Fine. I took that job.'
Good. I was wondering
what was happening.
I tried to call you but
your line was disconnected.
Ah, yes. I moved house.
I needed a bigger place.
'How's that book of yours coming on? '
Yeah. I'm getting there.
'It's a good job you've got
the job to fall back on.'
Huh? Oh, there's
my other line. Ciao.
I don't like it.
Why not?.
I don't like it at all.
It had a wonderful character before.
The gambler was so romantic.
He was a loser.
This guy's a croupier.
He can't lose.
People have shat on him all his
life and now he's in control.
He's a winner.
Is that your idea of a winner?.
He couldn't give a shit about anyone.
- He uses people...
- It's because of the sex.
You don't like the sex.
I couldn't give a fuck about the sex.
Most men'll fuck a lamppost.
He's just a miserable zombie.
Is that the way you feel now?
Is that what's happened to you?
- Marion, it's a book.
- Really?
Then why is he called Jake?
Why don't you come clean
and call him Jack?
There's no hope in it.
It's the truth.
Without hope,
there's no point to anything.
What is so fucking hopeful
about your job?
Spending the day catching
poor people stealing?
You say the organised gangs
get away with it.
In the casino everyone
gets caught, rich or poor.
The odds are the same,
it's all relative.
Crap. It is not relative.
It's unfair. It's designed unfair.
Like your casino and your
croupier's a little shit
because he goes along with it.
Yeah, what about the lottery?
Look at this. You're like
all the other suckers out there.
Is that your idea of hope?
- The door, Jack.
- Leave it.
No. Answer it.
Just called round to say
thanks for shopping me, Jack.
What are you talking about?.
Reynolds got a doctor in.
They forced me to do a dope test
which was positive, as you knew.
I don't know anything about it.
- Hiya.
- Hi.
Your boyfriend fucked me,
smoked my dope then shopped me.
What do you think about that?.
I can't get a job now.
You're no different from Matt.
Pair of vicious shits,
that's what you are.
Bella, I don't know
anything about this.
- All men are scumbags.
- I agree.
Well, go on. Go after her.
'He was Jack and he was Jake.
'And he had discovered
there was a price to pay
'for this double life of his.
'He had no idea where Marion
was staying or with whom.
'He realised he knew little
about her life, but then...
'he had never asked about it.
'For the first time in a long while,
Jack thought about his mother.
'She'd left when she couldn't
take it any more.
'His father had said, "Don't
worry, she'll come back."
'She didn't.
'But Marion wasn't his mother.'
He's paying out twenty-fives,
not tens.
I see that.
Little shit, Matt.
'Chapter three,
'his existence was forming
a pattern of betrayals.
'Sometimes he was unsure whether
he was betrayer or betrayed.'
- Thanks for the information.
- Pleasure.
Pity about Bella.
She was a real asset.
What could I do?
Sorry, Jack. No smoking in the nest.
Thank you, sir.
Fantastic. Just down here.
Jack?
I thought it was you. It's the hair.
Listen, I'm working on
that soccer story.
Right. Look,
I must get back to Habib.
- Habib?
- My author.
He's a terrorist.
He's written a kill-and-tell book.
Take care.
That's 4.99, sir. Thank you.
Jack, next weekend
I'm having a house party.
Here. It's just near Oxford.
Why don't you come?
It'll just be social, no business.
Bring a friend,
I've got plenty of room.
- I'll try and make it.
- Good. Looking forward.
Right!
- Your change, sir.
- Thanks.
'Books piled like chips.
'Stack 'em high, sell 'em fast,
make a killing.
'No dumb soccer novel for Jack.
'He would write about
the world he knew.
'From the inside.
'Chapter four.'
I don't know how you can drive
at night in those glasses.
How'd you hurt your hand?
It was just an accident.
It's nothing.
Should be the next on the right.
Jani, there's something I want
to say before we get there.
I don't know what the sleeping
arrangements are.
Giles probably expects us
to share a room.
That's fine.
Look, it's no use pretending
it was an accident.
I had a fight with someone.
That's all.
She's a dab hand with
the racket, your friend.
South African women are very sporty.
So I see.
Nice serve.
40-15.
How did she get that shiner?.
I found her in bed with someone.
Who was he?
She.
I say, you're a dark horse, Jack.
Lovely shot. Game.
- Come on, Jack.
- I don't gamble.
Don't be a spoil-sport.
It's only a few quid.
It's nothing to do with money.
I don't gamble.
He doesn't gamble.
- I'll watch.
- Jack likes to watch.
Does he like to watch?
One more remark
and I'll break your balls.
I bet she could.
I'll deal, but I won't play.
Sure you know how?
'The hands of a conjurer.
'Or a cardsharp.'
OK. Last hand.
- I've got an idea.
- No, no stripping.
We're not having that again.
Although...
I'll stick to bluffing.
That's what I'm best at.
- 'Stick.'
- Stick.
I don't know.
- 'Two cards.'
- Two cards.
- 'Two cards.'
- Two cards.
- 'One card. '
- One card.
- 'Three cards. '
- Three.
I'll start with a tenner.
I'll see your ten
and I'll raise you ten.
I'll see your 20
and raise you ten.
I'll match that
and raise you a tenner.
I'm in.
Yes. That's it.
I haven't got any more cash.
Yeah.
I call.
See you.
A straight.
Beat that.
A flush.
Shit.
Not so fast, darling. Full house.
Hang on, chaps.
That's impossible.
How's about this for impossible?
Four of a kind.
What's going on?
No.
Straight flush.
What are the odds of this happening?
Thousands to one.
Approximately.
Could have won
if I'd been able to bluff.
I get it.
Get what?.
Are you accusing me of cheating?
Good, God. No.
With a skill like that,
why do you want a job?
You don't need to work.
'Here was an interesting question.
'Was writing work?
'Or play? '
What happened?
Remember that guy
who cheated at the table?
You don't like cheats, do you?
So, which side do you like?
You choose.
That trick tonight.
I don't think I've ever
seen that done before.
It can only work with amateurs.
A pro would have spotted it.
- I didn't.
- Then you're not a pro.
Goodnight.
Jack.
Jack, I need your help.
I'm in a lot of trouble.
What kind of trouble?
I owe a lot of money.
Was that why you did that two grand?
- I couldn't help you.
- I know that.
But you can now.
I'm sorry. I don't have any money.
Some people I know.
They're planning
to rob the Golden Lion.
- You don't mean that.
- They mean it.
- Who's they?
- My creditors.
One night, around 3 am,
they'll come to the casino...
Forget it. It'll never work.
The point is,
they want a man inside.
I took you for a bright woman.
Just listen. You don't have
to do anything criminal.
- Robbery's not criminal?.
- You don't have to be criminal.
A guy'll deliberately
cheat at your table.
You'll see him, stop him.
The guy'll make a big scene
and that's when it'll happen.
You're serious.
You won't be committing a crime.
The man'll cheat, you'll just
be doing your job. That's all.
Shit.
And I thought you were
only after my body.
I've come to know you.
You're honest. I can trust you.
So what will you do
when it all goes wrong?
- It won't.
- If it does.
You'll keep the 10,000 pounds.
What 10,000 pounds?
These people will pay you
and 10,000 after.
They want someone
they can be sure of.
An honest dealer.
That's the point.
Not all dealers are honest.
Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
Reynolds. You've done your research.
There was nothing else I could do.
You're my last chance.
Next time it'll be my neck.
What about my neck?
I want to go back to Cape Town.
I want to start again. Clean.
Can't do it, Jani.
I'm asking you as a friend.
You'd be saving
the life of a friend.
'Jack wondered why
he was even considering it.
'Ten grand. In cash.
'That was why.
'But Jack didn't need the money.
'His father would have
taken it like a shot,
'but his father was a gambler.
'He was always broke.
'Jack suddenly realised
'it was Jake who was considering it.'
How much do you owe?
Let it go.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
I told you, all bets are off.
I'm sorry.
What for?.
I have to take the car.
'Hang on tightly, let go lightly.
'Chapter five...'
- Good night?.
- Not particularly.
And your lady?
She had to leave early.
She asked me to thank you.
- Bit unexpected, wasn't it?.
- Not really.
How's that soccer story coming along?
You said it was gonna be social,
Giles. No business.
'He was overcome
with a sense of urgency.
'He had to get it down.
Get on with the writing.'
It's beautiful. Thank you.
- I hope it brings you luck.
- It will.
I haven't brought you
much luck, have I?
That girl who worked at the casino...
I don't care about her.
I was wrong what I said
about the book.
I hurt you, didn't I?
I'm gonna leave
the casino soon, I promise.
- You will?.
- Within a month.
Believe me.
I'm gonna quit.
Then you can dye
your hair blonde again.
'Nobody around.
Leave a message after the beep.'
'I need to see you.
I've moved.
'I have a new number. It's 4753275.
'Please call me.'
'Chapter seven.
Jake had decided to see her.
'The challenge was essential.'
Come in.
It's not the Ritz, I'm afraid.
Is it yes?
Yes.
Thank you.
It doesn't seem fair.
You're offering me ten grand in cash.
You can't afford a decent place.
Life's not fair. We both know that.
It's all relative. I need money, too.
- Do you?
- Yes.
Look, the date's not set yet.
But I'll call you. One last thing.
The man you're going to catch
cheating, he may get violent.
But you know how to deal with cheats.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Bruise?
Yes. Yes, it's better.
I've still got mine.
And your hand, too.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
- You want a drink?
- No, thank you.
I don't think
we should meet again.
It's a shame there aren't more
men in the world like you.
'Question: Was he gambling,
taking Jani's money?
'Answer, no.
'Because he wasn't betting
with his own money.
'He was being paid
in advance for a service.
'In reality,
there were two clear elements
'of risk in this exchange.
'One, the possibility
the cash was counterfeit.
'Two, Jani or her creditors
'might want the money back
if the plan failed.
'To begin with, he put the odds
at two against, seven for.
'He checked a random selection
of bills at the bank.
'They were all good.
'Bring me some luck, darling.
'So now his odds were decidedly
better. Eight to one.
'The good notes gave one
less negative -two minus one.
'Mathematically, he had one more
positive - seven plus one.
'Next stage.
'He had to be secure at eight to one
'against having to
give the money back,
'so he wouldn't spend it.
'Lf after one month
no one had approached him,
'he calculated the odds of
keeping it at 20 to one.'
No more bets. Thank you.
'After three months
he figured 100 to one
'no one would turn up.'
Cash me in.
How about a little drink
to celebrate?
'Jake's experiment with the man
would prove his point.
'People don't change.'
Damn.
Money down.
'Chapter ten.
He watched their faces as they lost.
'Hour after hour, night after night.
'Relentlessly.
'He questioned
the conventional wisdom
'that gamblers are self-destructive.
'He had come to believe
that in reality
'they want to destroy everyone else.
'Their families,
loved ones, everyone.
'Fuck over the whole world.
'Without emotion, he watched them go.
'Jake stayed.'
'Nobody around.
Leave a message.'
'It's set.
The day after tomorrow.
'The 24th. Good luck.'
'It's set. The day after tomorrow.
'The 24th. Good luck.'
Are you ever tempted to gamble?
- Never. Why do you ask?
- I can just imagine
being around so much money
all the time.
- Gambling's not about money.
- Really?
Gambling's about not facing reality,
ignoring the odds.
I must be a fool.
I never think about the odds.
# Jingle bells, jingle all the way
# Oh, what fun it is to ride... #
'Chapter 12.'
Change. 2,500.
Money down.
Two seven five.
New dealer.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Can I help you?
18, 18, 17...12. 17, 20.
No more cards.
Larger than ten.
Place your bets, please.
Change. 50 pound.
Money down.
No more bets. Thank you.
No, I'm sorry, sir. Th...
That was a late bet.
- You calling me a cheat?.
- You are a cheat.
I saw you.
- I'm talking to you.
- It was a la...
Come on!
'Ladies and
gentlemen, please be calm.
'There is no cause for alarm.'
'Enjoy yourselves. It's Christmas.'
How did you know I was here?
I thought you wouldn't want
to spend Christmas day alone in here.
Did you go to the casino?
Happy Christmas.
Now...
noodles or rice?
I don't want a criminal
for a boyfriend.
There was a message, wasn't there?
It's probably easier
for you to eat the rice.
Marion.
What did you tell the police?
Nothing about you.
Then what?.
Give up being a croupier, Jack,
or I'll shop you.
All you have to do
is keep your promise.
Simple.
Here. Use a spoon.
Leave me alone, Marion!
You're already alone.
Marion! Marion!
Come here.
Come here. Listen.
I really don't want to lose you.
I'll quit.
I swear to you.
Why did you take the money?
I hate public transport.
- What?.
- I want to buy a car.
How can anyone be that naive?
So, how you feeling?
Bruised.
Take as long as you like.
Couple of weeks.
Three if you need it.
We'll pay you sick leave.
Don't wanna lose you, Jack.
You're a good man.
What's this?
Happy New Year.
Have a drink on the company.
You've earned it.
'Chapter 13.
'It's all numbers,
the croupier thought.
'Spin of the wheel,
turn of the card,
'time of your life,
date of your birth,
'year of your death.
'In the book of numbers
the Lord said...'
'..the Lord said,
thou shalt count thy steps.'
'Jack thought, this is it.
'The famous two-in-the-morning
knock at the door.
'It was pay-back time.'
'But he wasn't afraid.
'He hadn't spent
one penny of the ten grand.
'He'd covered himself.
'He knew the odds.'
Mr Manfred?
She was on her way home.
- To you.
- No, she wasn't.
'Marion had been visiting his mother.
'No, no, no.
Not his mother. Her mother.'
Her mother.
She was visiting her mother.
- Who are you?
- Detective Inspector Ross.
- Who?
- Ross.
Who did it?. Tell me.
We think it's a hit and run.
A drunk driver, probably.
There is the possibility
of a revenge killing.
'Revenge? For what?. Whose revenge? '
As you know, she was
a WPC with the Met.
Up until two years ago.
She called me last week.
She got wind of a planned
robbery at your casino.
'What had that got to do
with her death? '
You didn't recognise
your attacker, did you?
Of course
I fucking recognised him.
You did?
I know a cheat when I see one.
The man was a cheat.
If anything occurs to you,
call me, will you?
Do you gamble?
I was in love with her, you know.
'"The world breaks everyone.
'"And afterwards,

Hey!
Jacko, how you doing?
I heard what happened at the casino.
Pity they didn't get away with it.
I wish I'd been there.
- You were there, mate.
- What?.
You know what happened
to me, don't you?
That bitch Bella shopped me.
Bitch Bella shopped me
and you know what I had to do,
I had to beat the shit out of her.
You know what I'd like Matt?.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Cheers! Congratulations.
Happy New Year.
I like you, Jacko.
You're so fucking straight.
Here.
You haven't changed your clothes.
'The music stopped.
'Jack was drunk.
'Hallucinating.
'He was back.
'A child in the Wild Coast casino.'
You've been avoiding me.
Have I?
I'm Lucy.
So, what do you do, Lucy?
I'm a witch.
A white witch.
Are you gonna put a spell on me?
I might.
That's mine.
Fuckin' hell.
That's a nice car.
How much did you pay for it?.
Too much. 1800.
I saw her!
You don't trust women drivers,
do you?
'Jack didn't trust anyone.
'Except himself.
'It was finally finished.
'He thought of sending it to Giles,
'but that wouldn't be right.
'He would select a publisher
at random.
'Like a number.'
- Here, please.
- 20.
Blackjack.
You're wasting yourself.
With your luck, you ought
to come over to our side.
'Even his publisher had no idea
who the author was.
'He had done the deal
through a lawyer.
'It gave him a good feeling,
no one knowing.
'It never occurred
to anyone at the casino
'that the Golden Lion
had been his model.
'Why should it?.
Weren't all casinos the same?
'It gave him an exquisite pleasure
'being an Underground man.
'With all his money,
he hadn't even brought a car.
'Jack knew the truth about himself.
'He was a one-book writer.
'A one-time winner who had
quit while he was ahead.
'He changed nothing in the flat.'
'Bought nothing, spent nothing.
'The only thing he did was to
remove the bars on the window.'
'Nobody around. Leave a message
after the beep.'
- Hello.
- 'Jack, it's Jani.'
Jani.
- 'Where are you? '
- Sun City.
I've been meaning to call you
for months.
'So how are you doing? '
Great. Listen, I'm getting married.
At least, I think I am.
- Did you solve your problems?
- 'Yeah.'
I'm all over that now.
Jack, hold on a minute,
there's someone here
who wants to talk to you.
- 'Jacko.'
- Dad.
I never thanked you
properly for your help.
Jani tells me you behaved
like the perfect gentleman.
I knew you would.
I know my son.
The woman thinks I'm gonna marry her.
But you know me.
It's a shame things never worked
out, but we saw you all right.
'You didn't gamble
the ten grand, did you? '
As a matter of fact, I did.
- But I won.
- 'That's my boy.'
'How's that novel of yours coming...'
'So that was it.
'Final card.
'Blackjack.
'His father, 8,000 miles
and 27 years away
'was still dealing to his son, Jack,
'from the bottom of the deck.
'But Jake the croupier
had a sense of humour.'
Here's to you.
To both of you.
Who was that on the phone?
Couple I know are getting married.
Fools.
'Now he had reached the point
'where he no longer
heard the sound of the ball.
'The spin of the wheel
had brought him home
'to the place where he was born.
'The croupier's mission
was accomplished.
'He was master of the game.
'He had acquired the power
to make you lose.'
