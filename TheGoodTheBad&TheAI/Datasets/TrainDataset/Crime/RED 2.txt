Baby, check this out.
A power washer?
We need one of these.
SARAH: Yeah.
On the patio in the backyard.
Yeah.
Should we go look
at those window treatments?
No.
Do you want
one of these hotdogs?
They're very good.
Baby, you are
a heck of a homemaker.
You know that?
But we could just
go to dinner.
Well, you know,
if you don't make it...
BOTH: You don't eat it.
You know what?
That's a great idea.
What if I make you dinner?
I'm gonna go and get that,
uh, grill. The big shiny one.
Will you get us some shrimp?
The big jumbo kind.
Four down. Three over.
Come back and find me
down here. In tools.
What the hell
are you doing here?
You ignored my messages.
I am happy.
You're desperate.
I can make this work.
Frank, you're playing house.
Look, I'm retired, okay.
I'm happy. We are happy.
Frank... Frank...
You haven't killed anybody
in months.
That is not
a bad thing, okay?
That's a positive thing
for a lot of people.
Kemosabe, I need you.
They're coming. I can feel it.
You are driving me
nuts, Marvin.
Listen, if it makes you
feel better, bring the girl.
I'm not gonna bring the girl
anywhere, all right?
Don't bring the girl where?
Oh, we're just catching up.
Marvin's here.
I just bumped into Marvin.
Where are we going?
No, come on.
They're gonna close.
Good to see you, Marvin.
Good to see you.
Frank.
SARAH: You know you want to.
No.
Come on.
Last chance, Frank.
I'm taking Sarah home.
Stay safe.
SARAH: Well,
I really wanted to be...
Of course, it is, honey.
You are never gonna be
in danger ever again.
We don't even know
what happened.
We don't know
who's in there.
How am I gonna protect you?
Hey.
He was your best friend.
Okay?
Come on.
SARAH: Wow.
He still looks so lifelike.
He's not dead.
Honey, don't do that.
Just let your feelings out.
Don't...
No. Really.
He does this a lot.
Really?
No, come on.
Give me the pin.
Give me the pin.
Come on, sweetie.
Let's go sit down. Come on.
Come on.
I should kiss him.
Yeah, go ahead.
Do you want to?
Let's go sit down.
Come on. Come on, sweetie.
At this time,
we'll open the floor to anyone
who wishes
to say a few words
about the deceased.
Babe...
MAN: Share a memory,
perhaps?
Perhaps, a poem.
A song lyric.
Anyone?
You can do it.
Sir?
Marvin was
different.
He was
a very good shot.
Some would say that
he was paranoid.
But you have to
expect a little of that
when the CIA's
dosing you with LSD
for a little more
than a decade.
He could wire a bomb
faster than anybody
I ever met.
The good people
of Moldova will always
be in Marvin's debt.
He was a really good friend.
Really good.
I'm gonna miss him.
Gonna miss him.
FRANK: We have to move.
SARAH: Canada?
High ground.
Good kill zones.
It's a little farm.
A farm? Like, to farm on?
Yeah. Yeah.
Like, with crops?
Yeah. It could be fun.
Listen, babe...
You know they say it's really
important not to make big...
life-altering decisions
right after a loss.
If they can get to Marvin,
they can get to you
and they can get to me.
Who are they?
Go to the safe house.
Look at me.
Go to the safe house.
I'll come find you, okay?
I'm not leaving you.
Listen...
It'll be all right.
What is it?
Mr. Moses...
They want to debrief you
at a Yankee White facility.
Is that your sniper?
You're flagged
Retired Extremely Dangerous.
Hi, there.
Um, my client
Frank Moses is here.
He's an American citizen
being detained illegally
without due process.
You know what?
That is a lovely blazer.
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry,
I have no idea.
But let me get
Mr. Snyder for you.
Thank you.
How can I help you?
Oh, hi, there. I'm sorry.
What is your name?
John. You know what?
I didn't get your name.
Oh, it's Kelly.
Hi, Kelly.
John...
John... John!
Unless you want to
end up like Kelly,
I suggest you tell me where
Frank Moses is right now.
Now!
In interrogation.
I got a document right here
that says that
you have a special interest
in the Cold War.
We know that
back in the day,
you spent an awful
lotta time in Russia.
I just need to know what you
know about Project Nightshade.
I really don't know
anything about it.
What the hell is that?
Small arms gunfire,
Watch him.
They're coming to kill us.
Get me outta these cuffs.
I can't do that, sir.
You have the key, right?
Hands up!
If you don't
get me outta these cuffs.
Come on.
HORTON: Frank Moses.
You know, coming up through
the ranks, you were my hero.
Given enough time,
I guess everyone cracks.
Huh, Frank?
Who are you?
Me?
I'm the guy the government
hires to get information.
And I'm allowed to use any
form of torture I deem fit.
And I will torture Sarah
until you speak.
Speaking of Sarah,
I love watching her
shave her legs in the tub.
Kinda reminds me
of these Belgian mercs
I met in the Congo.
They would skin people alive
to get them to talk.
And do you know
where they started?
Guess.
At the ankles.
Just like your Sarah.
So...
You either give me
the information
that I need to know...
Or I'm gonna
fillet your girl
from head to toe
with no mercy.
Awesome.
Wow.
Pretty good
for a retired guy.
But are you...
with no weapon good?
Son of a...
Go. Go, go, go!
Shoot him,
but don't kill him.
All right, kill him.
Spray it up.
Frank, this is
your last chance.
Fire.
Get in there! Go!
Shit.
Marvin!
You're driving me crazy!
I brought the key.
You faked your death.
Gotta go.
Let's go.
Gotta go.
FRANK: You have no idea
what you put me through!
Oh! Thank God,
you're okay.
No!
What are you doing here?
Marvin brought me.
From the house.
Has everybody
lost their mind?
Marv, you don't bring
a girl like that here.
I had to see
if you were okay, didn't I?
Honey!
I thought...
What?
Remember when we
had that conversation
about how you were
gonna lay low?
You don't get to tell me
when to lay.
FRANK: I mean,
I'm not saying that.
Stop. Just don't.
Just don't... No.
You're mad at me now?
You treat me
like a China doll.
Frank, can I give you
a little advice about women?
No! Absolutely not!
Listen,
you gotta ask yourself,
what is a girl like that
doing with a guy like you?
It ain't for your looks.
You know,
I will shoot you.
I will shoot you in the liver.
A, R, D, A.
Adventure, romance, danger,
activities you can share
as a couple.
It's about you lying to me.
Frank...
I was very touched that
you cried at my funeral.
That's not true.
I didn't cry
at your funeral.
I'm no crier.
Ninety-six hours ago,
somebody posted
a document on the Internet
that said you and I
took part in an operation
called Nightshade
back in '79.
SARAH: That's why
you fake died?
Yeah. The chatter
went through the roof.
So everybody's after you
for something
they think you know
that you don't
even know at all?
Oh, my God! Spiders!
Honey, you need
to go to ground
and it's best
I don't know where.
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.
Cash only. No calls.
No contacts.
Thanks. Look...
I'm not hanging out
in some bunker
while you slink around
and save the planet
with dusky international
femme fatales.
Dusky?
Dark, smoldering.
I know what
it means, Marvin.
It's hard to be
the kinda person
I have to be right now
and do the kinda things that
I'm going to have to do
while you're here.
This is gonna be
good for us.
What are we doing?
Let's face it, Columbo,
things were getting
a little stale.
Wow. Mommy just slapped Daddy
at the dinner table.
Is there
a human being in the trunk?
Yeah.
Who is it, Marvin?
He's a Senior Director
of Military Intelligence.
I've been
caramelizing his onions
for a couple of days.
Caramelizing how?
With three tabs of acid
and a lot of rats.
Dang!
GENERAL MCKENNON:
Eleven people dead.
Five FBI.
And the SecDef
wants a briefing?
You were brought in
to contain this.
Calm down.
I can't believe
this is coming back on me
after so many years.
General,
Moses and Boggs have
been completely isolated.
The FBI is seeking them
for the murders.
Homeland has been informed
that they are officially
domestic terrorists.
Is that gonna work?
Yes.
The problem is
with that document
surfacing on the Internet,
all the players will be
coming after Nightshade.
It'll open the book on this.
I'm calling SecDef.
We need to go public.
General...
Nobody's going public.
We need a new plan
for Moses.
I need you
to approve a specialist.
What? CIA?
It's been tried, sir.
Didn't work so well
for those guys.
Han Cho Bai.
He's the best.
Do it.
Suit, too.
Okay, he's clean.
Seriously?
Sit down, Mr. Han.
Your security
is impressive.
COBB: A business associate.
Julio Alvarez Fernandes.
Very difficult
to get close to.
Of course, it must appear
like an accident.
Not a problem.
Except for one thing.
Mmm?
Mr. Fernandes pays better.
HAN: Yeah?
Oh, it's an old pal of yours.
Frank Moses.
Karma's a bitch, Frank.
DIRECTOR PHILIPS:
What is this?
There's a watchword flag
on a WikiLeaks document.
It's coded
Priority One Alpha Seven.
Something called Nightshade.
Shut up!
Get out.
Find me Victoria Winslow.
Director Philips?
Um...
I'm with someone right now.
Keeping busy, I see.
Idle hands
do the Devil's work.
Yes.
I understand you can get
close to Frank Moses.
Yes.
MI6 has a job for you.
If you want to stay alive,
you're going to accept it.
It's time to
choose sides, Victoria.
SARAH: Where do they
teach you guys this stuff?
Manuals, mostly.
SARAH: Mmm.
Some of this stuff
you just can't teach.
SARAH: Wow.
Isn't this cool?
We're on a mission together.
Do you have any idea
how many people
are trying to kill us
right now?
You and I both know
that this is where you belong.
Right here.
In the thick of it.
Pussy Cat's right, Frank.
Here we go.
Watch your step.
What?
Oh.
Come on!
Where did you get this?
Um... Marvin.
You gave her a gun?
It is America, Frank.
Everyone else has a gun.
She has no idea
what to do with this.
I know exactly
what to do with it.
Ow!
You don't give fire
to a kitten.
Why don't you just give her
some dynamite, Marvin?
No external safety
on the Sig?
Tell him what you told me.
Nightshade was cooked up
by a rogue US general
as a first strike capability
against the Soviets.
That's it. Can I go?
That's it?
You want a little pepper
with that?
No, okay! At the height
of the Cold War,
a megaton-yield device
was smuggled into Moscow
in diplomatic pouches,
piece by piece,
and then the weapon was lost.
That's it.
You lost a nuke in Moscow?
The scientist
was Edward Bailey.
That's it.
What?
I made a mistake.
Edward Bailey
was a genius physicist
who built
some of the greatest stuff
during the Cold War.
Neutron bombs,
particle beam weapons,
nerve gas.
Excellent nerve gas.
He was a rock star
of conceptual mass killing.
They called him
"The Da Vinci of Death."
We were the security detail
assigned to getting him
in and out of Moscow safely.
What happened?
We thought he was secure.
The Soviets got him
with a car bomb.
It was my fault.
He's dead.
Run or fight?
MARVIN: All we've got
is this WikiLeaks page
off the Internet.
Out of a Paris IP.
Hmm.
Paris could be anybody.
Wait. Wait.
Scroll back down
for a second.
What is that?
SARAH: Oh.
Uh...
Coffee stain?
Mmm. Wine.
Frog.
What?
We're okay.
Your number.
MI6 has just given me
a contract to kill you.
Apparently,
you're guilty of
nuclear terrorism, murder,
and you're number one
on Interpol's Most Wanted.
What did you say?
You know, the money's good.
And anyway,
if I don't do it,
somebody else will.
Who?
Han.
MARVIN: It's bad, isn't it?
Is that Marvin?
Yes. And Sarah.
They're driving me crazy.
Marvin gave her a gun.
Was it loaded?
Yes! Yes!
Are you being controlling?
No!
You have to be supportive.
I don't need her to fit in.
I just need her to be safe.
Dirty Dancing,
You know,
it's important to enjoy life
while you still can.
Victoria just accepted
a contract from MI6
to kill all three of us.
You don't think
she'd do that, do you?
SARAH: Frank, you don't
think she'd do that?
She's a friend.
Frank, what,
are you stupid?
You never took a contract out
to kill a friend?
She called
to give us fair warning.
Come on.
There's one more thing.
Han just went number one.
Why don't they just
dip our balls in honey
and stake us to an ant farm?
Come on.
Whoa!
Crazy old bastard.
MARVIN: Frank,
do you feel old?
Not really.
MARVIN: Me neither.
I mean, crazy sometimes,
I guess.
Who's Han?
Who's Han?
Korean. Counter-intel.
Frank put him in jail
for a few years.
We should be
super-scared of him, huh?
Yes. He is the best
contract killer in the world.
I've got a hit
off an old alias,
silent for almost 20 years.
He's dodging watch lists.
Bingo.
Private flight to Paris
scheduled for 0900
out of Teterboro.
Find their hotel.
Get blueprints and workups
on the day
and night managers.
Have Vance meet us
on the ground.
They're one floor down.
Two adjoining rooms.
Surveillance is
almost up and running.
HAN: This is going to be
easier than I thought.
ASSISTANT: Hello. Speaking.
Yes.
Where are they?
VANCE: They were here.
They ordered room service
at 1:00.
ASSISTANT: What do you mean,
"The plane is prepped"?
I think someone
stole your plane.
HAN: I'm really
going to enjoy killing him.
Get me a gun
that really hurts.
SARAH: So how good
is this guy?
Han is the best
contract killer
in the world.
Let's just say that Frank
is in some very,
very deep dog doo.
He's not gonna kill me.
Yeah.
Nobody kills Frank Moses.
Right!
The people
he really doesn't like,
he tortures
for a long time first.
Can we just focus
on trying to catch The Frog?
Okay. What's the action plan
for target acquisition
and rendition?
Marvin?
Quit teaching her stuff!
Nice.
What do you think
the most expensive
bottle of wine
in the world costs?
MARVIN: Chateau d'Yquem 1847.
Maybe five, six, maybe,
bottles left in the world.
It's pretty pricey.
Maybe we should get
a bottle of that wine
and try to catch
The Frog with it.
SARAH: My God,
this is so romantic!
Come here.
Keep your head down.
But we have to go to the
Ile Saint-Louis for gelato.
I don't think so.
SARAH: Really?
What about the...
Frank, is that...
Mmm-hmm.
Hello, Frank.
Have you seen her since?
Nope.
God, I've missed you.
Who is she?
Trouble.
How are things?
Yeah, Frank, how are things?
Sarah...
This is Katja.
Yeah. Hi.
I need to speak with you.
Immediately.
What the hell was that?
Katja Petrokovich.
Russian Counter-Intelligence.
I think we should hear
what she has to say.
MARVIN: Frank...
MARVIN: You don't know
the half of it.
She and Frank were young.
And he didn't have
the slightest idea
she was working
for the Russians.
She's Frank Moses' kryptonite.
I like you
with no hair, Frank.
Bald men are so sexy.
Virile.
Wow.
She's cute.
Where did you find her?
Nebraska?
Kansas.
Kansas.
So what was it you wanted
to talk to me about?
I would like to believe that
the US didn't plant
a weapon of mass-destruction
in Moscow. But I don't.
Why are you in Paris?
We come every fall
for Strike Season
and for the weather.
KATJA: Oh?
Well, the US seems to think
you're nuclear terrorists.
Russia wants complete access.
You agree now
or I'll hand you over
to the US government.
Can't we just kill her?
Excuse me for one second.
Can I talk to you?
What? Oh.
Uh-huh. Sure thing.
Come here for a minute.
You know, I was shocked.
I got it.
Yeah, I know.
She was kinda counting
your teeth with her tongue.
A little, yeah.
SARAH: Can she go now?
We don't really have a choice.
We need her to help us.
I promise
there is nothing between us.
No, sir. This guy's
not giving us anything.
Website's been scrubbed.
NSA intercepted a dispatch
to the Kremlin from Paris.
Moses is going after someone
called "The Frog."
The Frog.
So they call him "The Frog"
because he's French?
No.
No, he poisoned
the water supply
at KGB headquarters
with the Amazon
tree frog poison.
He must have been wiping
those little tree humpers
for years.
Incapacitated 1,600
people and left with
every secret we had.
You know, the guy
makes a fortune
selling information.
He knows so much
even the US won't touch him.
The hard part
is gonna be taking him alive.
Superb.
Wine is wine.
I want to buy American
air defense protocols.
Why is it terrorists
never appreciate Burgundy?
Look, I don't think you know
who you're dealing with.
Shh!
Hmm.
Confirmed. It's him.
It's The Frog.
SARAH:
Well, just act natural.
And whatever you do,
don't look him
right in the eyes.
Check.
Remember,
don't look right at him.
Idiot!
Marvin, you all right?
Yeah.
All right.
Get her outta here.
When?
Now!
Get a car!
Is that...
Cut them off!
This is not a good idea!
She's not gonna
get there first!
Sidewalk!
Yes!
No!
Yes!
Happy trails, bozo!
Don't you think
we should let...
Shut your pie hole, Marvin!
MARVIN: Don't you think
we should let...
Hush!
Incoming!
Bastard! Sidewalk!
SARAH: What the...
She's fine.
FRANK: Got him.
KATJA: What are you doing?
KATJA: Look!
What is she doing?
MARVIN: I'm begging...
Yeah, yeah. I got this.
I so got this.
I hate her so much.
You're wasting your time!
You're going to regret this
more than you can
possibly imagine.
Hey.
You know who we are?
Yes, of course.
Tell us about Nightshade.
You think I'm going to
roll over for you hegemonic
Mickey Mouse-loving Americans?
Leave Mickey out of it.
Yes. That one's rather...
God's sake!
KATJA: 1945.
Wait, wait, wait!
That bottle...
How do we find it?
Never!
Nightshade was the plot
of lunatics.
I used to be like you.
Driven by ideology and fear
with no love of
what's beautiful in the world.
I can't trust
animals like you!
Do what you will.
Death is easy.
It's not about
the destination.
It's about the journey.
Death is an art form
in Russia.
KATJA: There are so many ways
to take a man to bits.
Shall we start with a Chechen
facelift? Hold him down!
Stop! Stop it!
This is how we do it.
Please. You're so brave.
But you have to understand
we're doing this for
the right reasons. And this...
This isn't worth your life.
You must have
something to live for.
Art.
Wine.
Women?
Hey.
Help us.
We need this information.
You'll be helping us
save the world. Please.
Mmm.
You, I'll help.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
And you can suck it.
FRANK: Baby? Honey?
SARAH: Seriously?
You hooked up with that?
What a woman.
MARVIN:
Is that the same dress?
They look the same to you?
No one ever called me
Frank Moses' kryptonite.
Frank's crazy about you.
I've never seen him afraid
of anything except losing you.
What if I'm ruining his life?
Frank is a very
simple creature
with very simple needs.
Okay? It's killing,
eating,
sexting,
eating...
Killing, I guess.
What's your point?
I can't believe
you kissed The Frog.
Well, I've kissed
a lotta frogs.
I got something for ya.
What is it?
The key to The Frog's
security deposit box.
From?
Credit Lyonnais.
Baby, I have a request.
SARAH: Uh-huh.
How would you feel about
going out to dinner
with me tonight?
Hmm.
It is Paris, after all.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
I need you, Frank.
It's not a good time.
KATJA: One of our old assets
has some real information.
He needs to
meet with us right now.
Nah.
Frank, what are you doing?
She's kryptonite.
What are you doing?
I'll handle it.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
It's not okay.
It's just some work.
No, it's not fun.
Go. You and Svetlana,
you work it out.
I promise you
that I will be back
in time for dinner.
I'll be back.
Keep her safe.
What happened to us, Frank?
Well...
Hmm.
You betrayed me.
You set me up.
Tried to kill me.
I tried to kill you.
They were good times,
weren't they?
You know, if you'd asked me
to betray my country,
you know I would have.
Yes, madam.
My God.
You know,
I looked you up once.
You were in a bungalow
in Los Angeles.
There were roses
out in front.
But I lost my nerve.
So what do you want?
It was all about work
with you, Frank. Rules.
Not rules.
Right and wrong.
You know, it's harder for me
not to follow orders.
Despite my personal feelings.
But feelings don't matter
any more than right or wrong.
Orders matter.
Orders?
Russia will handle things
from here.
I'm taking the key, Frank.
I can't let that happen.
No?
I can't feel my arms.
Enjoy Kansas.
Hmm.
He's out.
He might be awake.
Oh, good.
So he can feel it.
Did you ever,
ever in your entire career
let yourself get drugged?
You still like her!
And now she has the key!
She doesn't have the key.
She has a key.
What?
I knew she would play him
like a banjo at
an Ozark hoedown.
So I have the key.
Water.
How long was I out for?
Some of it's his.
Marvin?
Style is the only
constant in life, Frank.
We didn't come to Paris
on vacation.
Oh. Shopping's what I thought
you did in Paris
with your boyfriend's money
while you're waiting for him
to wake up
from being taken down
by his skanky, slutty,
Russian biatch ex-girlfriend.
So thanks. Thanks.
Thanks for the compliment
for the fur.
For telling me that
I look nice in my dress.
It makes me feel really good.
And it makes me feel
very loving towards you also.
FRANK: Why is she
doing this to me?
We can get a taxi over here.
Frank, listen,
I gotta tell you something.
You have to start to learn
to share your feelings
to evolve your relationship.
Even if it seems
uncomfortable at first.
Say you're pinned down
in a firefight.
If you stay where you are,
you're gonna die. Okay?
So, you tell me,
what do you do?
Make the run.
Yes. You have got
to make the run
to emotional safety.
Huh.
You dead yet, Moses?
FRANK: Not yet.
Where's my plane?
FRANK: In my ass!
It's in an airport
outside of Paris.
What are you... Shut up!
Let's get outta here.
Marvin?
Yeah?
Is that a stick of dynamite
in your pocket?
Yeah, but I'm saving it
for an emergency.
Well, this is kind of
an emergency, isn't it?
The key I gave her
is connected to
a particularly nasty
terrorist cell
and their safe deposit box.
The French take this
kinda thing pretty seriously.
KATJA: That's enough.
Put me down!
Put me down now!
All right.
MARVIN:
We gotta move quickly,
Moscow will have her out
within the hour.
For the love of Mike.
All right.
I'm still not
talking to you.
All right. This is an MI6
report on Project Nightshade.
It's about the operative
that placed the device.
They took him into custody
and put him on ICE.
What's ICE?
Incarcerate, Cannot Execute.
Who would they keep on ICE
for 32 years?
Come on. Gotta go.
Come on where? Oh!
How could she have
possibly found us?
'Cause I called her
and told her we were coming.
I couldn't take the pressure
of not knowing.
Why isn't she
shooting at us?
That should buy us 24 hours.
Hello, sweetie.
You know, the next time
you two make a plan like this,
you could at least
let me in on it.
Frank,
you're compromising me.
Who knows what
some girl is gonna
squeeze out of you?
Where'd you get the bodies?
My freezer.
Come on. Wake up.
Yeah?
DAVIS:
Sir?
No, he took some sorta poison
before we really talked.
I don't think
he's gonna say anything now.
Mmm. Mmm.
Don't worry.
I'm on the trail.
MALE GUIDE:
It's a fortress.
It's an asylum
for the criminally insane.
He's in the ICE unit.
That's an MI6 Alpha Level
secure facility
buried deep within
that building.
It's like a prison
within a prison.
How are we gonna
get in there?
VICTORIA: She wants my head!
She wants my head!
It's a Papist plot.
It's her. It's that bitch
Mary, Queen of Scots.
She wants my head.
What are you doing? No! No!
Get me Cecil. Get me Cecil.
I'm the Queen of England!
Don't take me to the Tower!
I'll have your head for this,
you bitch!
No! No!
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."
They're plotting
against me. All of them.
There's a good queen.
Stuff it, you old bat.
Thank you.
Not so much the "old,"
if you don't mind.
VICTORIA:
I thought I was kind of
channeling Bette Davis.
Good morning.
Dr. Jones to see
prisoner number 17, please.
Dr. Jones?
Are you with MI6?
Sadly, not anymore.
Because I don't seem
to have you on my list.
Bloody thing's not working.
Why's that?
You're supposed to use...
Lay down on the ground.
Attaboy. On the floor.
Number 121.
Oh, there it is.
Frank!
Who are you? You're visitors?
Who are you looking for?
We love having visitors,
don't we, fellas?
Dr. Bailey?
Dr. Bailey?
Yes. Who did you expect
to find here? Hmm?
FRANK: Sir...
What?
I saw you die.
Saw me die?
Who is he?
Frank?
Frank Moses,
my dear fellow!
How are you, old sport?
So glad to see you.
So glad you came by.
We've been expecting you.
Haven't we, fellas?
My God, Frank, why are
you so old? Good lord!
Sir...
What?
You've been locked up here
for 32 years.
Come on, Frankie,
you've gotta be kidding me.
Come on, put 'em up.
Thirty-two years.
How extraordinary.
Who are you?
Victoria.
Victoria!
You should read this.
Lenin.
Jolly good time.
Stalin got it wrong,
of course.
So where are we going, Frank?
Are you taking us
to the opera again tonight?
Is that where
we're going, Frank?
The opera?
We love the opera,
don't we, fellas?
Yes, the opera
and the champagne
and the strawberries
all 'round.
Sorry, my dear,
what is your name again?
Victoria.
I'm sorry, it's the drugs
they've been feeding me,
it's my short-term memory.
The drugs
they've been feeding...
Something that's meant to
keep us peaceful, I suppose,
or harmless!
Anyway, I know
it's around here somewhere,
but I don't know
where it is.
Dr. Bailey,
we need your help.
Mmm?
Do you remember Nightshade?
I'm sorry,
I'm looking for my pipe
and my
St. Christopher medallion.
Boys gave it to someone.
They were little boys,
you see.
Now where it's gone...
It's gone somehow.
VICTORIA: Um...
Oh, shit!
BAILEY: Hey, Frankie,
I'm over here.
I found it. It was
in my pocket the whole time.
I couldn't find
my damn pipe, though.
But here it is.
Sorry, my dear,
what was the question
you asked me?
Do you remember Nightshade?
Vaguely. It was some kind of
a bomb, I believe.
Dr. Bailey, people
are looking for that weapon.
People who want to use it.
Oh, dear. Yes,
I do understand, of course.
Believe you me.
But you know,
I made many things
for the Americans and
Nightshade turned out to be
a bit of a nightmare.
It was quite different.
Turned out to be
too dangerous.
So naturally, they had to
lock me up in this place.
And after what they did to me,
I think it's perfectly natural
I tell them all to go F off!
MI6 tried to fake
Bailey's death?
Why? What are they hiding?
You're gonna have to go.
You're gonna
have to go find out.
VICTORIA: You know
they're gonna try and kill me.
I'll call you from Russia.
VICTORIA:
MAN:
We got a breach
in Maximum Security.
Secure!
DAVIS: All right,
what's so important?
I just heard
from my source at MI6
that Edward Bailey's alive
and on the run.
That's not possible.
This is bigger
than a rogue general
and his unexploded ordnance.
What don't I know?
The game has changed.
The things Bailey knows
are too dangerous.
We can't let Bailey
or Nightshade
fall into terrorist hands,
or millions will die.
Holy shit, it's real.
Unless we secure it,
that weapon's going off
in the middle of Moscow.
Right now,
that's our best case scenario.
Guys?
Ah!
Welcome, my friends.
So, it is true.
You're alive.
Tell me, then,
where is this device?
Who?
Work in progress.
IVAN:
Frank Moses into the heart
of Mother Russia.
Oh, before I forget. Frank.
Frank, a little something.
If you are caught
or Han catches you
suicide pill
is a much better option
than what you face.
You die with Russian smile on.
Good luck.
Mr. Bailey.
Yes, Frank?
Is there any way
you could tell us
where you hid
the nuclear weapon?
Look at all those cows, Frank.
They're beautiful.
Yeah.
FRANK: Cows?
Hi! Yoo hoo!
That's not good.
We have eyes on, Frank.
Where's my plane?
They paid me to kill you.
They didn't say
I had to do it all at once.
HAN:
This is not over, Moses.
HAN: We're not over!
It's not!
SARAH: What's wrong with him?
SARAH: Wow.
What is this place?
FRANK: My first safe house.
Untouched, since 1984. Aw!
Fugu poison?
Fugu poison is deadly stuff.
Terrible death.
This your little gizmo?
XKG gas. I invented it.
We tried to take out
old Fidel Castro
in '61 in Cuba.
That didn't work though.
Any tea, Frank?
Why does Han
hate you so much?
Not enough hugs as a child.
Frank framed him
for stealing state secrets.
So he went from being
a highly decorated
counter-intel officer
to...
...to being a pariah.
What's ironic though,
is that Frank
actually created
the circumstances
for his own death.
It's poetic.
I ain't dead yet.
Should you eat that?
Is that safe?
It's before they had that,
you know,
"sell by" date stuff.
Oh.
So did you get to
meet Castro?
Who?
Did you get to meet Castro?
Yes, I did, actually.
About two weeks
after Kennedy
was assassinated.
Talking of which, Frank,
I'm starting to remember
more and more who I am
and who I was
and the weapons I made.
My God,
it really is amazing.
How efficiently
those boys from MI6,
may God bless 'em...
But you know something, Frank?
They really do throw us away.
Don't they, old sport?
When we're no longer
convenient, I suppose.
As though
we'd never given them
the best years of our lives.
Bit of a joke, really.
Yes, very strange.
Do you remember
where Nightshade is?
I'm sorry, my dear?
Do you remember
where Nightshade is?
Oh, yes.
Now, this feels right.
It's around here somewhere.
I'm sure this time.
Everything looks
different completely.
Maybe it's over here.
It's been hours. Hours.
BAILEY: Yeah, this is it.
Here we are.
How are those Jimmy Choos
working out for you?
The entrance is up there.
Who's Papa John?
MARVIN: It's new.
Entrance to what?
BAILEY: Secret tunnels
through the old catacombs.
Brezhnev used it
to sneak his mistress in.
SARAH: In where?
BAILEY: In there.
FRANK: The Kremlin?
The weapon is
in the Kremlin?
It's the one place
they wouldn't look.
Jesus. Do you mind
keeping it warm?
PHILIPS: You have no idea
the damage you've done.
You kept one of our own
locked up for 32 years.
I have kept the world safe.
If that weapon
falls into the wrong hands...
The weapon?
You haven't
the slightest idea.
You must let me call Moses.
He doesn't know
what he's walking into.
You've had your chance.
It's over.
I'm sorry, Victoria.
Sorry, my ass.
They say
you're a legend around here.
I've...
I've never heard of you.
Must have been
a bit before my time.
Well, you've heard
of me now.
How is it possible
they never picked up
the radiation signature
from that bomb?
That's the
million dollar question.
Hey, gang. This is new.
What do you think
is behind that wall?
Um...
I think Russians.
If anybody sees that hole,
we're dead.
I'm gonna need you to help me
to disarm the weapon.
Frank, somebody's
gotta guard the door.
No.
But...
MARVIN: You'll need this.
FRANK: One more time.
Great. Great.
What does that mean?
"Gas leak.
Maintenance is coming."
Good.
And then they'll move on.
SARAH:
And what if they don't?
Want a gun?
Yes.
No. No gun.
Just don't move.
You're a security guard.
Don't smile.
You can't smile.
You just never leave
your post. Okay?
Nice.
Two shots, here and here.
Drag the body in there
and repeat as necessary.
No safety.
No safety.
MARVIN: Frank, I don't like
the Kremlin so much.
And I like being
underneath it even less.
That's great.
It's just like yesterday.
There's my wrench or crow bar.
Look at this.
There.
Hey, look, chaps.
That's my old pipe.
I knew I'd left it somewhere.
My dear wife bought this
the fifth, 1969.
It was our
wedding anniversary.
Oh, yes! This is, um...
This is Nightshade,
by the way.
There.
Is that...
That's Red Mercury.
Red Mercury?
We were always told
it was a Cold War myth.
Yes, they said
it couldn't be done,
but I did it. See?
Frank,
if that's Red Mercury,
you can zip it up
in a backpack
and take it
on the White House tour.
It's undetectable.
No signature.
No fallout.
BAILEY: This is a weapon
that will entirely change
the balance
of international power
overnight. Just like that.
MARVIN:
We're all gonna die.
On your knees.
Katja.
No government
should have this weapon.
Not yours. And not mine.
I have orders.
This isn't about orders.
This is about right and wrong.
Don't.
Did you really come
to see me in the States?
Yes.
What color were the flowers
outside my house?
Yellow.
What in the name of... Hey!
What are you doing
kissing this guy?
I didn't wanna kill him.
What kinda
stupid logic is that?
What in the Sam Hill
is she doing here?
She's working with us again.
Like heck she is.
Why were you
kissing that guy?
Kids, what happens
in the Kremlin
stays in the Kremlin.
You are gonna have to
explain this to me.
Hey, Comrades!
Here's to more success.
Success.
SARAH: And saving the world!
Saving the world!
KATJA:
I got this. Right back.
Hey.
Where are you?
Moscow.
He's a nutter, Francis.
MI6 didn't lock him up
because he created the weapon
but because
he wants to see it go off.
Hello, Frank.
That was Victoria, wasn't it?
Telling you that I was
some sort of a monster
who once wanted to destroy
the Soviet empire.
Yeah. Very slowly.
That's it. Good boy.
Good. In you go.
Marvin...
Guns down.
BAILEY: Weapons down.
Very slowly.
You planted the thing
on WikiLeaks.
Oh, yes, it was a cell phone
taken from a guard.
I was just itching to get
my revenge on MI6, you see.
Frank, you were
absolutely marvelous
the way you found The Frog.
No one else
could have found him.
Jack?
Sorry, Frank,
I made a deal already
with Mr. Horton
for Red Mercury.
Well done, Bailey.
Thanks.
HORTON:
Nice to see you again, Frank.
Pick up the guns.
Your country appreciates
your sacrifice, Frank.
But your time's up.
Let's go.
It's time, Bailey.
Yes, it is time.
Very Interesting.
Rogue American agents
turned nuclear terrorists
kill top Russian officer.
Not good.
So long, Frank.
So long, Marvin.
Come on, boys, let's go.
Easy. Easy.
Oh, please,
let me take that from you.
I thought we were doing
the debriefing in London.
HORTON: Oh, we were.
But since you're such a sick,
twisted bastard,
you're going to Colorado.
There's a secret
facility there,
it's about a mile underground,
where you will
spend your remaining years
having every bit of knowledge
plucked from that
giant head of yours.
Really?
Hmm.
And since
we're speaking frankly,
I should say that it will
make your last 32 years
seem like a vacation
in the Caribbean.
Cuff him.
Mmm.
Oh, I say.
Well, well.
Bet you didn't
see that coming.
Did you, old man?
I must say, I didn't.
Jolly good.
After you.
BAILEY: Thank you.
Good morning, gentlemen.
What did he say?
Ready.
Do something. Do something.
I love you.
At least Han
didn't get us first.
Really? You're gonna
bring that up right now?
Ah, there is nothing more sexy
in the whole world
than a beautiful woman
with an incredible gun.
You're such a romantic.
Watch your eyes.
Close your eyes.
I love the way your toes curl
right before you fire.
Hopeless.
Mmm.
Ah!
Freeze.
Shh!
You know something?
I don't think
you ought to point
that idiotic thing at me.
About your security protocol,
don't you think?
What the hell is that?
That, my dear boy,
is an antidote
to the most powerful nerve
agent ever created. Look.
Hello, boys.
Hello, Mr. Davis.
And you didn't
see that coming.
Did you, old sport?
I'm sure you wouldn't want
to miss what's coming next.
It's a little antidote.
Jolly good.
That's right.
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
Good. Thank you.
Jolly good.
VICTORIA: Honestly, two days,
Frank, two days,
and you're in front
of a firing squad?
Yeah. But look...
No. No excuses.
You're better than this.
It's pathetic.
Frank, an American
military transport
made an emergency landing
in London.
Everyone aboard
was found dead.
Bailey has taken refuge
in the Iranian embassy.
MARVIN: The Iranian embassy?
We've gotta go there.
All right. Get 'em ready.
I'm gonna make sure
we're cleared for takeoff.
If the world is here
in a week,
I will meet you
in the Turks and Caicos.
Mmm-hmm.
And we will spend all night
beneath the stars.
Beneath the stars.
Mmm...
I don't speak Korean!
You having fun yet?
I'll let you know
when I start having fun.
HAN: You betrayed me.
I had no choice.
You'd have done
the same thing,
if you were me.
How much is the US
paying you?
Are you kiddin' me?
I asked for more.
What happened to you?
You used to be a good agent.
Stop! Wait a minute.
Listen, I need your help.
I know there's a part of you
that wants to do
the right thing.
There is a weapon
that's gonna be detonated...
Bullshit.
It's not bullshit.
There's a bomb
headed for London right now.
Eleven million people
are gonna lose their lives
if you don't help me.
All right.
Let's go.
This doesn't mean I'm not
going to kill you later.
I know.
VICTORIA: I think the way
to make a relationship work
is that neither of you
give up who you are.
Don't you agree, Marvin?
Exactly.
Exactly what Marvin says.
Falling in love
is like jumping off a cliff.
You just have to
believe and let go.
My God!
Are you okay?
No, he's all right.
He's with us.
We talked it out.
Kill Bailey.
Secure the weapon.
How hard can it be?
VICTORIA: Of course,
the external security
but inside there are hardcore
Revolutionary Guards.
They are serious fanatics.
You do realize,
if they catch you,
they will kill you.
SARAH:
Okay?
You know,
I've been thinking about
you and me.
And I just...
I got you something.
Wow.
You like it?
I love it.
Seven rounds.
Okay.
Not yet. I'm not ready.
Stop, no.
If you don't do it,
you're gonna blow it,
all right?
Look at me.
I'm gonna count to three.
Mmm. Listen...
I'm gonna count
to three, okay?
We can go back to the...
In English.
One...
Not now. No. Wait.
Two...
God damn it.
Hi.
FRANK:
She's gonna get killed.
It's tough when
they leave the nest.
Frank, come on.
A little trust.
She has talents
you and I will never have.
What talents?
People like her.
If she lives,
this'll be good
for your relationship.
MARVIN: You're right.
And if there's
one thing I know,
it's women and covert ops.
That's two things.
No, grasshopper.
It is not.
I wanna tell you a secret,
Mr. Minister.
Is she gonna make out
with this guy, too?
Ohh!
What the hell was that?
SARAH: Blowfish poison.
Paralysis and shooting pains
will grip your entire body.
And you will slowly asphyxiate
until you choke to death
while remaining
fully-conscious,
unless you do
exactly what I say.
I will die before
I compromise my country.
Okay. We will drive you
to your office
where you will write a letter
on official stationery
denouncing the treatment
of women in Iran.
Then you will
get your antidote.
That's it?
How may I help you?
Ah. Dr. Bailey,
my apologies for the delay.
Professor Dombrovski has
declared the weapon authentic.
And we're prepared
to proceed.
As soon as
my money's transferred,
Mr. Ambassador.
Move! She's with me.
Arman?
He needs to go.
Okay, okay.
What are you talking about?
Who is she?
Sir, I'm sorry,
you need to leave.
You need to shut up!
No.
MAN: What?
What is happening here?
Tell me
what is happening here!
Who is she?
Get out!
When I say "get out,"
get out of here!
You need to go!
You shut the fuck up!
SARAH: Where's the safe?
What?
Where's the safe?
Poo poo's coming.
MAN:
GUARD: Stop!
Plumbers, wait!
It's okay! This way.
Money received.
Good show.
Let's see our friend here.
Would you lend me
your knife, please?
Thank you.
Sorry about the mess
on the carpet.
Oh, well.
At this point, Jack...
You don't mind me
calling you "Jack," I hope.
You must be beginning
to comprehend
the stunning totality
of your failure.
You can't give it to them.
Oh, I've no more interest
in giving Red Mercury
to these boys than I have
in giving it to you.
Jesus.
Yes, it's a sad old world,
you know.
Anyway,
that's only my opinion.
But the central point
is this, Jack,
you see, when men like you
and those dickheads from MI6
or CIA or whatever
sewers you came from.
When you take away
not only my life
but the innocent lives of
my dear beloved wife Natasha
and my little boy, who was
only six, you see. Yes.
I mean, what can I say?
When you mess
with me, buddy,
this is what you get.
Go to hell, old man.
Fare thee well, patriot.
Boom.
Now what's next?
Ah, Washington.
Baby, hey.
Are you okay?
Hah!
Awesome!
Oh, shit.
Is that it?
It's counting down, Frank.
Shut it off. Right?
Shut... Yeah.
With what? Acupressure?
I don't know.
Well, why is it
my responsibility?
HAN: Just do something.
MARVIN: With my
Mr. Chemistry set?
I don't know
what I'm doing.
You want me
to push a button?
Bailey's loose
and the bomb's ticking.
GUARD: Wait. Excuse me, ma'am.
Hello, I have an appointment.
WOMAN: Gun!
Get that bomb outta here.
Drop it now, darling.
That's right.
SARAH: My gun!
Press the button.
Ground floor.
Marvin, let's go!
Jolly good show.
Bollocks.
You really drive
this ridiculous thing?
Can you shoot?
We need eyes, Francis.
Come on, Frank.
Forty minutes.
Marvin, how ya
doin' back there?
I can't talk
to you right now.
How is it?
It's fine.
Shit!
Show me something.
FRANK:
I got eyes on.
Bailey's heading for the M4.
Got it.
MARVIN: Got it!
This one should stop it
and this one
should detonate it.
It's fifty-fifty, Frank.
Wait!
That's weird.
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?
Wait, wait!
Wait!
Stop cutting wires!
I knew we were gonna die!
Ready to kill
this son of a bitch?
Abso-bloody-lutely.
Damn it!
Trouble.
Frank, it's two pedals
and two sticks.
Okay.
Damn it! We missed him.
He's going into the airport.
FRANK:
Well, where are you?
In trouble.
POLICE:
Frank, they're gonna blow us
outta the sky.
I wouldn't worry about that.
The engine's shutting down.
Mayday! Mayday!
MARVIN: Frank!
I knew we were gonna die!
POLICE:
Oh, please,
tell me you're not crashing
with a weapon
of mass destruction.
MARVIN: No, Frank, no.
Oh, God.
You okay back there, Marvin?
It wasn't exactly
a three-point landing, Frank.
How's the bomb doing?
I can't stop it.
FRANK: We gotta
get it outta here.
Hey! Hey!
Get outta the car.
BAILEY: Hello, Frank.
Welcome aboard.
Always the good soldier,
aren't you?
Stalemate.
How will you take him out
and not shoot her first?
Frank, it's okay.
You can shoot.
It's okay.
BAILEY: Put the gun down.
Put the gun down!
Drop the gun!
Put the gun down, Frankie.
Thank you.
Pretty smart.
So love does conquer all.
Go to your golden warrior.
That's a good girl.
Aw!
FRANK: Come here.
BAILEY: Ah! It's so sweet.
Now leave the plane.
Take Nightshade with you.
Bye, Frank.
Sweet dreams.
Why didn't you
just shoot me?
What happened?
I couldn't disarm it.
Oh, crap.
Marvin,
it's going to detonate?
Yeah.
Put your arms around me.
Oh...
I didn't see that one coming.
There's something
you don't see every day.
VICTORIA: You put the bomb
on the plane.
And, um, you didn't think
to mention that?
You blew up my plane.
Sorry.
I was wrong?
So we're not even gonna die?
Not yet.
I was actually
starting to like you.
I was even thinking about
not killing you.
This is what happens when
you try to save the world.
Han. Han, you can't
put a price
on these things.
Uh-uh.
You owe me 30 mil
for the plane.
And 20 for not killing you.
You're a dead man, Moses.
Thanks for your help.
Really.
You think he means it?
Nah, he's a nice guy.
I mean it, Frank!
All right.
VICTORIA: Aw!
They're going to be
right as rain.
He made the run
to emotional safety.
FRANK: So...
I did hear
about this job in Caracas.
And?
Don't look at me.
She's your girlfriend.
Oh.
Come on.
