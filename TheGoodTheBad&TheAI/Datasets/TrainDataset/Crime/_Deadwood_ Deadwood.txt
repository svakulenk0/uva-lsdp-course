Is that some sort
of a letter, Marshal?
- Journal.
- Journal.
Good.
You know, I was goin'
to Deadwood, same as you.
- Is that so?
- I had my plans about set.
I only wish to Christ I could get
these past three days back.
I can imagine.
No law at all
in Deadwood,
is that true?
Being on Indian land.
So then you
won't be a marshal?
Taking goods there to open
a hardware business, me and my partner.
If I'd have got there,
I'd have been prospectin'.
Jesus Christ Almighty.
No law at all,
gold you can scoop from the streams
with your bare hands,
and I gotta go
and fuck myself up
by supposedly stealing
Byron Samson's horse.
It's poor damn timing
at the least.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry as hell
about your shoulder.
Flesh wound. Don't look like
it wants to infect.
Well, never mind
flesh wounds, sir,
when you are goin'
to meet your maker,
you don't feature telling him that you
shot a marshal in the shoulder
for only doing
his legally ordained job.
He may have heard
worse stories.
God? Well, if he ain't,
I'll tell him six or seven
just on people of my own
personal acquaintance.
I'd like to suggest
an idea to you, sir,
that I pray as
a Christian man
you will entertain
on its own fuckin' merits.
Does it involve
letting you go?
I know two scores,
Mr. Bullock,
that we could
make in transit
without moving
People with cash on hand,
and if once we hit Deadwood
and you didn't want to have
anything to do with me,
we'd never speak again.
We would meet as strangers
the rest of our fuckin' lives.
Now...
you tell me what
you think of that, sir.
It don't appeal to me.
Get the fuck out of here
for a moment, would you, sir?
Byron Samson's
comin' for him.
Sir, would you please
get the fuck out
till we have finished
our previous conversation?
- How many backing his play?
- A dozen, shit-faced.
Samson caved in
Tommy Raymond's head at
- the No-Name Frog. He went against it.
- What are you conversing at?
Jesus Christ!
Come out and talk
to us, Bullock!
Now who is that?
That sounds like Byron Samson.
- Yeah.
- What would he want?
Now tell me what kind
of fuckin' luck I got.
All you're doing stalling,
Bullock, is pissin' me off!
'Cause I guarantee you ain't
making it through in there till sun-up!
So why don't you climb out
from behind your badge,
and your big
brick building,
and you bring
Clell Watson out here
so we can give him
what he fuckin' deserves!
What have we got here?
Whoa!
It's a Jew on a wagon!
Yeah, right out here
in the alley!
I'm executing sentence now
and he's hangin' under color of law.
You and your partner plan on making
Deadwood, Marshal,
do not try for this scaffold.
That's a deal,
you loud-mouthed cocksucker!
You hear this?
Oh! Wait, this ain't right.
My sister was comin'
in the morning.
- What would you have her told?
- That's not enough of a drop.
I'll strangle
for 20 minutes.
I'll help you
with the drop.
Get up and say what you'd
have your sister told.
Do not tether that
rope off of that porch!
Any more gunplay
gets answered.
You called
the law in, Samson.
You don't get to call it off
just 'cause you're liquored up
and popular on payday.
You don't tell us what to do
and what not to do,
'cause you're leaving
Montana anyways!
Now do not jump off
of that stool, you cocksucker!
Or what?
You'll kill me?
You tell my sister
if my boy turns up,
raise him good.
What else?
Tell her
give him my boots.
What else?
Tell him his...
daddy loved him.
Tell him...
he has
God's forgiveness.
Anything else?
You help me
with my fuckin' fall!
Come ahead.
Fuck you!
Stay back!
Move the fuck back,
while my partner...
while my partner's taking
his sweet-ass time
writing whatever the fuck
he's writing over there!
Who'll give his last words
to the sister?
None of you
better fucking move!
Shit!
I'll do it.
Thank you.
- Let's go.
- Hee.
Move ahead!
Move out of the way!
- Move!
- Jesus Christ, come on!
- What's going on!
- Move it up there!
Same damn wagon that
broke down yesterday, Bill!
That's the hold up, huh?
Same wagon and no damn room
to maneuver.
Sounds like it's
tighter out there
than a bull's ass
in fly season.
- How's your headache?
- Not bad.
You want me
to canvass for whiskey?
That's all right, Jane.
Believe me, we're stuck here
a fucking while.
I know your
canvassing techniques.
I don't want any casualties
on my conscience.
It's only
Wild Bill Hickok
you got stalled here
in the muck!
You ignorant
fucking cunts!
We're out here
the whole goddamn day?
What a goddamn circus!
Shit.
- We've got no water!
- All right, friend.
Let's go!
Come on, now,
come on, now, come on.
Chickens for sale!
$3.00 a pair.
Get your chickens here.
This lot rents
at 20 a day, Seth.
- $20 a day.
- Tent only, no construction.
Corner location.
In advance, every morning,
to Mr. Swearengen at the Gem.
- Where's the Gem?
- You'll find it.
Everybody does.
Eight ounces of gold
at $20 an ounce is 160
plus $10 for a half-ounce
makes 170 total.
Inform your dealers
and whores of my credit,
and pour me
a goddamn drink!
Honor and a pleasure,
my good man.
for Ellsworth.
Yes, sir,
I'll let
everybody know.
Lot four,
some hardware guys.
First one today
with this hand.
And pour me another,
my good man.
Here comes another.
- Lot four a stayer?
- Wagon loaded with goods.
Now with that limey
damn accent of yours,
are these rumors true that you're
descended from the British nobility?
I'm descended from
all of them cocksuckers.
Well here's to you,
Your Majesty.
I'll tell you what,
I may have fucked my life up
flatter than hammered shit,
but I stand here
before you today
beholden to no
human cocksucker,
and working a paying
fucking gold claim.
And not the U.S. Government
saying I'm trespassing,
or the savage fucking
red man himself,
or any of these
limber dick cocksuckers
passing themselves off as prospectors
had better try and stop me.
They'd better not
try it in here.
God damn it, Swearengen, I don't trust
you as far as I can throw you,
but I enjoy
the way you lie.
- Thank you, my good man.
- You're welcome,
you conniving,
heavy-thumbed motherfucker!
Watch out!
That's her derringer.
I warned you about
that loopy cunt!
Keep your own tally!
Oh, have no fear
on that score.
I said not to beat on me!
I told him!
Ticonderoga, New York,
Barnett Robinson...
- You got any other guns?
- No, I don't got any more.
Ticonderoga, New York,
Barnett Robinson...
Ticonderoga, New York...
did you find it?
Barnett Robinson.
That's who to noti
if this thing goes wrong.
Yeah, I've got it
right here.
- How you doing, Trixie?
- I told him, don't beat on me, Doc!
- No one asked for your version!
- Said I robbed him
and he started beating on me.
And I didn't rob you!
- I don't remember.
- I didn't, God damn it!
Aw, she shot me
right in the head.
D-don't put
your fingers in it.
Oh yeah,
is it bad, Doc?
Shh, shh, shh.
Get the Chinaman!
Sure would like to know
how he lasted for 20 minutes.
Shot straight to the brain.
So prospect in him
till Dan brings the Chinaman.
Do you mind if I take him
to my place?
Sure. Help the doc with this guy, bring
the Chinaman to the Doc's.
I'll bring that
sled right in, Doc.
Doc,
you drink free today.
And I hope
any word of this
would keep the gun
out of the whore's hand.
- That wouldn't come from me.
- Bastard did himself in.
- Come here.
- I said to stop.
Tell me in my office.
Get the gimp
to clean this place up.
Ugh, Doc!
You know
there's something
peculiar about
this man's cerebral setup
or they can just
write off the forebrain
as being the center
of thought and speech.
Let's just get him
on the sled.
Of course it...
won't matter
to Mr. Wu's pigs.
Whiskey.
I've got an urge to see
that camp, Charlie.
All right...
- Can we leave you with the stock, Jane?
- Yeah.
Bill and me are gonna
ride ahead into camp.
I expect I'll be there
before sundown.
Well, we'll know
where to find you.
What in the hell
do you mean by that?
That I enjoy
a fucking drink?
I wasn't aware
that's outlawed.
Thanks for looking
to the stock, Jane.
Excuse my ill humor.
Certain people wear
on my fucking nerves.
She likes me better
than she likes you.
I wish to hell I knew
what I ever did
to get on that woman's
wrong side.
- You know a back way into the camp?
- Whoa.
We don't go
to the camp.
We go home...
back to Minnesota.
You probably
got the right idea.
Jesus Christ Almighty,
move it!
I can't get to my spot
until you finish!
You got me circling my wagon
like a fly around shit.
We're pretty near done.
We gotta long wait, same as you.
This the first wagon
you ever fucking unloaded?!
Hold on to my horse,
I'll show you how to do it!
We know what we're doing. Put your hat
back on and stick with your wagon.
- And what if I don't?
- Stand there mouthing off and find out.
Sir...
I have a commode
for your inconvenience.
- You think I'm gonna pay for that?
- No, that's free.
From Star & Bullock Hardware,
open in Deadwood soon as we locate.
Hurry up
and get finished!
My father's last words
there in Vienna,
before he passed away,
was "Sol, lose a can
to buy the goddamned fool.
You could slow it down
and sell 'em at retail."
I gotta put a book together
of your old man's deathbed sayings.
That was Wild Bill Hickok
just riding past us, Seth.
I seen him in photographs.
He lost his
stake gambling.
He told me before
he passed out.
He said he lost his stake
and he hadn't found no gold
and he was going back East
after one last piece of pussy.
None of that's
anything to me.
He wakes back up,
starts in beating on me.
Where's his stake,
where's all his money?
You call Danny,
you call Johnny.
Must've been me
who took it from him.
You don't shoot nobody 'cause
that's bad for my business
and it's bad for
the camp's reputation.
He beat the living shit
out of you, didn't he?
Do what you
gotta do to me.
Don't tell me
what to do.
Either way this comes out,
we'll only have to do it once.
What's it to be,
Trixie?
I'll be good.
All right now.
We heard rumors
you might be coming,
but you can't believe
every rumor.
We heard you might be
coming from Cheyenne.
- Here I am.
- If every rumor was true
we'd all have been
scalped now by the Sioux,
or the government would've tossed us out
as treaty violators.
- E.B. Farnum, how do you do?
- Charlie Utter.
You got some mighty
clammy hands there, partner.
Damp palms run
in my family.
Here to prospect, Mr. Hickok,
or on other business?
I'm here
to get a room.
Could we get two?
We're worn out looking at each other.
Separate rooms.
I'll arrange that by tomorrow,
but today I can't fix it.
Unless you
kill a guest.
Wild Bill Hickok.
Nothing can
ever be simple.
He didn't speak of having
lawman ambitions, Al.
Starting with Custer
getting himself massacred,
it's been one thing
after another.
Leaves the godless savage cocksucker
Sioux on the warpath...
if that long-haired
loudmouth had held his end up,
we could be operating
here in peace.
The New York dude's
downstairs, Al.
- Did he order whiskey?
- Yeah.
Did he down it
or is he sipping at it?
He's sipping.
Why'd I even ask, huh?
Go get Tim Driscoll.
Make sure the dude
sees you leave.
- What should I tell Tim?
- Tell him to get over here.
Tell him he's drunk,
sorry for himself, give me five minutes,
- then you come back, do your part.
- All right, Al.
As far as Hickok, Al,
if I'd have pushed him
any harder on his plans,
I was afraid
he'd shoot me.
- Go get Driscoll.
- Yes, sir.
Handmade!
It's all handmade,
guaranteed.
It ain't like something's
being foisted on 'em
they'll be sorry
they bought come sun-up.
- I know that.
- These are quality items.
They meet
these folk's needs...
offered at fair markup,
and we're announcing their availability.
Brought through Indian country
figures into the markup.
By us,
at personal peril.
Let's go.
Coming out with your fly down
might strike the wrong note.
Come have a look, boys.
Star & Bullock
Hardware and Mercantile
just opened for business.
We got boots
to sell you.
Knee-boots, $10!
Hip-boots, 15!
We got picks,
pans and shovels.
Picks at $12,
shovels at 10, and pans at 8!
We got plaster cradles,
prospector's best friend.
Perfected at
the Montana strikes!
We got chamber-pots
to sell you.
If you don't know
what one of those is,
the man living next to you
will appreciate your finding out.
I'll look at your
biggest size hip-boot.
- Got 'em right here.
- We stand by our stock.
Any item that don't do
what it's supposed to
will be exchanged
for one that does.
And we'll be here
for you to find us.
Son of a bitch!
The man said I might
get a prize.
I paid 50¢
for this bar of soap,
there's a $5 prize
in the wrapper.
- Where'd you buy that soap at?
- Man standing right over there.
Front your game
away from our tent.
Cash prizes,
every night's case of soap.
Hey, storekeep!
Hold me some of those
large hip-boots till I get over there
- and I'll pay you $2 extra.
- Set prices, boys,
and first come,
first to be served.
We'll get you
squared away.
No free feels
in this house.
Brom Garret
of Manhattan,
scourge of the Deadwood
faro tables.
Don't think I
confuse two nights
holding good cards
with being a faro shark.
Two here, Dan.
You... you see
a finish to that?
Did you hear
Bill Hickok's in town?
Oh yes, I did.
Does that give you the vapors?
Are you mad
about something, Al?
I'm not mad
about nothing.
All's I can tell you, things sort out
fast in Deadwood.
I vouched for you with Tim Driscoll
two hours in here last night
when I gather you must have
been home in bed, sleeping.
End result, Tim's just
about got his claim sold to E.B. Farnum.
What? Where's
Driscoll now?
He ain't here
so I'd assume at his hotel.
- You told me he's here by 6:00.
- He ain't yet.
Al, E.B. Farnum just saw me here
and headed for the door.
I wouldn't know how
to interpret that.
I was doing
the legwork, Al.
I was doing
the due diligence.
You tell me Driscoll's
got money troubles,
and he's a motivated
seller, fair enough.
But how did I know his
claim's not played out?
- I had to do the legwork.
- I see, fair enough.
- Oh that's what I had to ascertain.
- Did you do the legwork?
Al.
For God's sake,
close your fist.
Cleaned up during the night
with five more just like it
from Claim No. 9
above Discovery,
panned
at the Driscoll claim.
All I can say, Brom,
while you were out winning the battle
I hope you didn't lose
the fucking war.
Al.
Who is that?
Tim Driscoll...
shit-faced.
Let me handle
the play.
Oh my God,
he is shit-faced.
- Boys?
- Whiskeys.
Two whiskeys.
I'm... I'm respecting
your privacy
not saying your name,
but I certainly recognize you
and I'd like
to buy the round.
- Charlie Utter.
- Tom Nuttall, Charlie.
Tom.
It's Bill Hickok.
I seen him kill Phil Coe in Abilene.
Ahem, A.W. Merrick,
Mr. Hickok,
of the...
"Deadwood Pioneer."
- We're drinking whiskey.
- Certainly.
Certainly.
Whiskeys here, Mr. Nuttall.
I'm gonna say one thing
before anybody opens their mouth,
and I won't say
no more on the subject,
and I'll be through
for the fucking evening...
I'm not impressed.
So what brings you
to our camp, Mr. Hickok?
May I tell my readers?
Warrant out on me
in Cheyenne.
Aw, get off
of that now, Bill.
Well, I suppose
for a man like you,
warrants are
a vocational hazard.
Calling me
a professional vagrant.
- The warrant was for vagrancy?
- He's kidding!
Anyway, in this camp,
warrants don't count.
I'm telling you he's
not impressed, all right?
Now you may apply that
to whoever you feel may be my reference.
And I intend to gut that son of a bitch
at poker whenever I get the chance.
You run that game?
Can I buy 50 in chips?
I do and you can.
Just settle up
after you see how your luck runs.
Feel like playing now, Bill, or you
wanna take in the rest of the camp?
I feel like
playing now.
Draw and five stud.
Dealer calls the game.
Sounds fair.
See you later, Charlie.
All right, Bill.
- You boys mind if I sit in?
- Not at all, have a seat.
What a grand surprise.
I never thought he'd live
long enough for me to meet him.
I need another gun.
What, in case
they beat on you?
Never mind what for,
just take this and get me another gun.
Go on, you can touch
my nipples if you want to.
Now Mabel! Mabel!
Get your ass across that table!
This dollar
is not for drink.
- My name's Caroline.
- Well, you'll always be Mabel to me.
Claim No. 9 above Discovery,
$14,000, yes or no?
$14,000,
yes or no?
All right, we'll
make it 14,000.
Spit in your hand.
Spit in your hand.
- What's his fucking problem?
- Aw, nothing.
Done, witnessed.
- Am I too late?
- Mm.
No, no, no, but you're
too late Farnum.
I just sold to this goose-Iooking
fella for 14,000.
- Will you take 16?
- No, thank you, but no.
What a fucking
lying cunt you are.
"12 and a half
thousand...
that's every cent
I can get hold of, Mr. Driscoll.
And more than
the claim is worth" you said.
standing over a drink.
I believe events will prove
that Claim No. 9 above Discovery
was worth far more
than 16,000, Mr. Farnum.
Unhand me, Al.
Though, you know, of course,
I haven't actually seen
- his fucking money yet.
- I'm discounting his banknote. Dan.
There's $10,000.
I'll weigh four
out of the other sack right now.
Al's holding
a full faith letter of credit
for $20,000 from
the Bank of New York.
Full faith is one thing,
but until the money
has actually passed hands between us,
the deal isn't done.
- The deal is done.
- The deal isn't done.
- The deal is done.
- We spat in our hands.
What the fuck
would you know?!
I'll knock you into
the middle of next week.
Now, would you offer me
the 16,000?
I suppose, if you're open
to further offers.
- What the fuck did you just do?
- Will you close at 16.5?
- You just reopened the fucking bidding.
- 17,000.
I'll go no farther.
- 18!
- 19!
I can put together.
Damn it!
Damn it!
- 20 twice.
- I can't.
It's over,
he's through.
- Is it over?
- All right.
in the shiny suit.
- I got it, Al.
- Yes, you did.
Comes to look for
a business opportunity,
and sits there
losing at poker.
Is he having a bad run?
I can't see that far.
You'd have to see
back to Cheyenne.
He lost his patience,
stays in hands whether
he's holding cards or not.
How's your crowd in here
tonight, anyway?
Oh, it's all right.
It's better than all right,
you could see that much.
Bill Hickok's an asset to any saloon,
any joint he frequents.
- You agree with me on that or not?
- You got a say in that?
- As far as where he drinks and gambles?
- Suppose I did?
frequent here exclusive.
What a sport
you turned out to be.
- You quote a figure.
- Let's come to one understanding.
Any figure I would've come up with,
part of that you give to him
to gamble or piss away
however else he's gonna do it.
That'd be the only part
he'd know about.
I'd work with you.
The rest you'd give to me
to hold in trust for his future.
- Now that'd be your affair.
- Listen to me,
that man's
recently married.
He needs to put
a stake together.
That's all
I'd be in this for.
I'd work with you.
Banish all headaches.
Spit in your hand,
Alma!
- What?
- Spit.
I'm gonna
show you something.
Promise you'll tell
my mother about this.
I bought it.
We own a gold claim.
This is how we sealed the deal.
And then did everyone
dry their hands?
Do you know who
I was bidding against?
Farnum, who owns
this hotel.
Oh and where was
your secret agent?
Dan Dority?
He was tending bar.
No one realized how Dan had helped me
wreck and order the claim.
Now Swearengen...
runs the saloon...
he was intermediary,
he brokered the deal.
Driscoll, the seller,
legless with liquor.
You will have a vivid
entry for an article
and I've told you
all the details.
Yes, I've already
begun to imagine it.
It was a near thing
till the end.
I had to go all our 20,000
to turn Farnum away.
Oh well.
I'll have to write the bank
to renew my credit.
Of course
they'll contact Father.
Well...
I expect
that's inevitable.
Wild Bill Hickok
is here.
I'm sure he's going
to prospect too.
- How much do you want?
- Well, we agreed on 30%.
- 30% of 20 would be six.
- Mm-hmm.
So I want
the 6,000.
What's 30% of 14,000?
- What the fuck, Al?
- Who told you to take him to 20?
Well, I could feel that
he had more in him.
It was just a spontaneous
fucking feeling
and I knew that
there was more to get.
And you thought six more would be
the jackpot, take him from 14 to 20.
Oh Jesus Christ, you know,
if you had further plans,
I wish you'd have just
said something to me.
Should I tell you
when I plan to take a shit tomorrow
or would that be none
of your fucking business?
So... 14,000.
what is that now... 4,200.
What the fuck arrangement
do you suggest now?
- What do you suggest?
- Oh Jesus Christ Almighty!
You get in a mood like this and I just
as soon as not even discuss it.
Look, let me just
have 500, you know,
and we'll discuss the rest of it
some other fucking time.
Cash or credit
at the tables?
Fucking time of trial, the fucking
English in you comes out. Fine.
I'll have the 500 at the fucking tables
then. Jesus Christ Almighty!
- Are we holding markers?
- You're holding markers, all right.
You've been holding markers against
my kind for the past several centuries,
across both sides of the fucking water!
How the fuck do I know?!
Ask Dority,
he'll know better than me.
Credit it against
the fucking markers,
but just let me hold 20,
in fucking cash.
- Tell Dan to give you 20.
- And a piece of fucking pussy.
Tell Dan, then tell him
to come see me.
And thanks for stepping in on the side
of right and fucking justice,
you deaf dumb bastard!
I tell you, Al, you could
have knocked me over with a feather
when he took him to 20.
Did you see me struggling
to stay on the path?
My wife and children
are in Louisville, Kentucky.
I'm saving
to bring them out.
Days I dig on
the Foster's water ditch
and nights I watch folk's goods
like I'm going to do for yours.
Schedule like that seems like you'll
have 'em here in no time.
Then sabbaths I preach Christ crucified
and raised from the dead.
I'm from Etobicoke,
Ontario.
- So you were born in Canada?
- I come to Montana when I was 17.
- That's when I met up with Mr. Star.
- Is that so?
I was born in Austria.
Austria? Wonderful
where people come from.
I was born in Austria and then
I grew up in Chillicothe, Ohio.
And then you partnered
with Mr. Bullock in Montana?
That's where
we partnered up.
The Lord is
our final comfort,
but it's a solace
having friends.
I know that
from past experience.
You sure sold up a storm
here tonight, didn't you?
- We did all right.
- We'll be a few hours, Mr. Smith.
We want to look
around the camp.
I will watch your goods
as if they were my own.
- Thank you, Mr. Smith.
- Thank you.
Whoa.
I seen a terrible
thing tonight.
What'd you see?
I seen white people
dead and scalped and...
men, women, and children
with their arms and legs hacked off.
Where? How many dead?
Well, it was a whole family
on the road to Spearfish.
Oh my God, it's them heathen
bloodthirsty savages!
- How many was it died?
- It was the whole family, they was...
hacked and mutilated.
The parents,
two children.
The Metz family
took the Spearfish road
going home to Minnesota.
Then that was
probably them then.
They had three children.
Were there three?
There could've
been three 'cause...
they was all hacked...
and spread around.
Rest their souls.
- Rest their souls.
- Yeah.
You probably
need a drink.
You called my bluff, Hickok.
I was trying
to run one. Whoa!
Wait on Mary.
I got a third eight under there.
Three eights wins,
your pot.
- Oh I absolutely did not realize that.
- Your chips.
Here I am thinking I'm fucking
bluffing the third eight,
and I mistakenly outdraw
the greatest gunfighter in the world.
Meaning the third eight.
- What?
- Saying you outdrew me.
You meant
the third eight.
Well, what else
would I have meant?
Say it.
Then we'll play cards.
Third eight's
what I meant.
- Deal.
- Ante's up, same again.
Jesus Christ, can we
shake hands or something?
Relieve the atmosphere?
I mean, how stupid
do you think I am?
I don't know.
I just met you.
The paradox is the massacre
at Little Big Horn
signaled the Indians'
death throes, Mr. Utter.
History has overtaken the treaty
which gave them this land.
Well, the gold we found
has overtaken it.
I believe within a year
Congress will rescind
the Fort Laramie Treaty,
Deadwood and these hills
will be annexed
to the Dakota Territory,
and we who have pursued our destiny
outside law or statute
will be restored
to the bosom of the nation.
And... that's
what I believe.
- Does bosom mean tit?
- Same thing.
Ain't nothing
against y'all fellas,
but I'd as soon do my drinking
and getting a piece of ass.
First you want people
to know about that family.
Yeah, well, what harm is it
in me meeting my needs
before I circulate
the news?
What if the third
child is alive?
You listen, mister,
it was a massacre.
I'm the one who saw it.
And there ain't no one was alive.
Did you see
the massacre or not?
I told you I got there
afterwards.
So by then, the child
could've got away
from where you saw
those other bodies?
Or the child
could've been hiding
and so afraid of
who you might be, it didn't call out.
You listen to me, I ain't going back
out there again tonight,
so you mind your own
goddamn business!
You're saying a family
is massacred by Indians
on the road to Spearfish
and one child may still be alive
- and it's no one's concern...
- What's this about a massacre?
Oh, for Christ's sake!
God damn it!
I ain't going out there
again tonight
after I just made camp with my scalp
by sheer dumb fucking luck!
Ride out and show us
the place.
I'll guarantee
your scalp.
- You riding?
- Yeah.
- We'll ride.
- May I ride?
I'd be honored to ride,
infirmities permitting.
Here we go.
Wild Bill
fucking Hickok.
You were a marshal
in Kansas?
Yeah.
- And you?
- Montana.
- Come to your senses now?
- Yes, sir.
The fella's story on this
don't hold water.
No, it don't.
- What'd you give Driscoll?
- 20 bucks.
Free poke with Wanda.
- Half-smart mick that he is.
- Yeah.
Tim really fucked up
with the dude, huh?
I guess the dude's case money.
Dude only out here three days.
How's the dude ask
his people back home for more?
- They're liable to send the Pinkertons.
- So shut the dude down?
You being
his secret best friend,
he'll want you out prospecting
in the morning beside him.
That claim needs
to pinch out.
Oughtn't take but a couple days,
he ain't got much sand.
Tim Driscoll
needs to be seen to.
- No kidding now?
- No kidding.
Well, not that
anybody asked,
but I'd look to Trixie
for danger before I'd look to Tim.
No kidding!
Jimmy says the Sioux massacred a family
on the Spearfish road.
A hand come into
Nuttall's No. 10
- telling the story, Mr. Swearengen.
- Who was he?
- I never seen him before.
- Can you get him over here?
Is he still at Nuttall's?
They're riding back out
to where it happened.
Hickok and some others
were riding with him.
Did the hand look happy
to be riding back out with Hickok?
He didn't look
too happy.
How many people downstairs
did you tell about this?
- A few.
- A few?
You let him tell a few people downstairs
before you bring this to me?
Al, I brought him
as soon as I heard!
How many people do you think the people
he talked to have talked to by now?
I guarantee at this minute my entire
fucking action downstairs is fucked up!
Nobody's drinking, nobody's gambling,
nobody's chasing tail.
I have to deal
with that!
You want $10
or a bottle of dope?
Bottle of dope please,
Mr. Swearengen.
- Give him a bottle of dope.
- Come on, I'll take care of you.
He's got a lot
on his mind, Johnny.
Quiet! Al's got words!
I guess when it starts
pissing rain in here,
you know
who to blame, huh?
I know word's circulating,
Indians killed a family
on the Spearfish road.
Now it's not for me to tell anyone
in this camp what to do,
much as I don't want more people
getting their throats cut,
their scalps lifted,
or any other godless thing
that these godless
bloodthirsty heathens do...
or even if someone wants
to ride out in darkest night,
but I will
tell you this:
I'd use tonight
to get myself organized,
ride out in the morning,
clear-headed,
and starting
tomorrow morning,
I will offer
a personal $50 bounty
for every decapitated head
of as many of these
godless heathen cocksuckers
as anyone can bring in,
tomorrow, with no upper limit!
That's all I say
on that subject
except next round's
on the house.
And God rest the souls
of that poor family.
Amen.
And pussy's half-price
next 15 minutes.
Okay, ladies,
let's go.
She must have done some fancy fucking
to keep Al from killing her.
Where's Bill Hickok?
Where's Charlie Utter?
Give me a drink!
It's all right, Al, I know you got a lot
on your mind.
That was one hell
of a good talk.
Look, you got everybody
back at the tables,
- doing what they do.
- Tell you the truth,
for murdering people
on the road to Spearfish
my money'd be on
Persimmon Phil.
Make it look
like Indians.
That is
his speciality.
Is it true?
Indians killing
white people?
That's the sewer mouth
that follows Hickok around.
Why are we
standing here?
Riding out tomorrow,
daybreak.
Oh, really?
Tomorrow?
What's your
fucking rush?!
I'm going now.
Even without Bill.
Even without Charlie.
I know the road
to Spearfish.
And I don't drink where
I'm the only fucking one with balls!
Let her go.
She ain't taking
any business with her.
And don't forget
to kill Tim.
Yah.
Wah! Yah!
Get to your room.
You should be sleeping
on a goddamn pew.
You in love?
Wake up, friend.
Come on now.
You know I don't intrude
on the affairs of others.
Problem enough keeping
my own life straight.
When something's not my affair,
I don't pretend it is.
Contrariwise,
if you feel like talking
about that headlight...
I'll pay a dollar
a minute to hear you.
Get anything off
your chest you feel like.
What I got on my chest
don't concern you,
Ellsworth.
And fuck us all anyway
for the limber-dick cocksuckers we are.
- What is it?
- Just hush, Tim.
Doc! Get up!
Doc!
Doc!
Doc! Wake up!
Doc!
Oh God...
Wait for me,
God damn it!
Just hold on
till I'm with you.
She don't mean nothing, Doc,
she's just excitable.
What kinda hand is
your friend with a gun?
I don't feel
qualified to say.
I guess I done my duty
and I was glad enough
to help.
Stick around,
see if she lives.
Nah, I was...
glad enough to have done my duty
and that little one
will be in my prayers.
- Get down off your horse.
- Listen to me.
I'm an innocent man,
it...
it was them Indians,
God damn it!
Too much ransacking,
and too many goods left behind.
Someone was after money.
God damn it, if I had something
to do with what happened,
why'd I come
to this camp, huh?
Maybe when it got
thick out there you ran.
Maybe the others
was going to ground,
but you had
to have pussy.
And get
to a faro layout.
I felt that way
sometimes after a kill.
Get down off
your horse,
or face
the consequences.
Was that you or me,
Montana?
My money'd
be on you.
Yeah?
