Uh!
Oh
Afternoon, Mrs
Afternoon, Sheriff
- You know the Funthes boy?
- Um
Mackatee Funthes?
Oh, no, not him
Weemack
- Mackatee's eldest
- Oh, yeah
- I don't believe I do
- Well, he's a good boy and all,
but he done gone down to the Costco
in Pascagoula and got hisself a blaster
- What?
- And he been playing that music
- Well, if you want, you know, I could
- Loud!
- Well, I could go talk to him if you
- "Left My Wallet in El Segundo"
- He left his wallet?
- Hippity-hop music!
You know, they calls it hippity-hop music,
but it don't make me
want to go hippity-hop
Hm
And Othar don't like that music neither
- It's been disturbin' Othar then, has it?
- Well, how could it help but do?
"Left My Wallet in El Segundo"!
And, Sheriff, do you know what they call
colored folks in them songs?
Have you got any idea?
- No, ma'am, I don't think
- Niggers!
I don't even want to say the word
Now, I won't say it twice,
- I can tell you that
- Yes, ma'am
in the course of swearin'
down my complaint
- Yes'm
- Niggers!
Mm-mm-mm!
The age of Montel!
- Mm-mm-mm!
- Sweet lord of mercy,
- is that where we at?
- Mm-hm
Weemack down to Pascagoula
and gettin' hisself
a big ol' thumpety stereo
so he can listen to that trash!
- Sheriff, you got to help that boy
- You want me to help him?
Extend that helpin' hand
Show an interest
- Well, we're here to help
- Well, God bless you for that
You don't want to be tried
and found wantin'
- No, ma'am
- No, many, many done
tunkalow parzen, Sheriff
Many, many done tunkalow parzen
Many what, ma'am?
You been tried and found wantin'!
You don't want that writin' on the wall
Oh, no, ma'am
Don't want that on the wall
- Feast of Balthazar
- Yeah, that sounds good
The apostle John said, "Behold,
there's a stranger in our midst
"
- Yes, ma'am
Do you need somethin' to eat, angel?
Othar, I went and complained
about Weemack today
Don't know if it'll do any good
That boy hangin' by a thread
Over the pit
Fiery pit!
"Left My Wallet in El Segundo"
Ooh!
You mean to tell me you never once
suffered from piles?
Well, it's the human condition
Most humans, anyhow
Like that ballplayer said,
"The world's got two kind of folks"
"Them that's got the piles
and them that's goin' get 'em"
But you always was healthy as a ox
Passed on 'fore you could get the piles
Mm-hm
Ooh, thank the Lord you never was sick
I just want to pass away
nice and peaceful
Go to sleep one night, wake up
in the glory land! Whoo!
Pickles!
- Go fetch Pickles!
- Pickles?
Oh, he's up that tree again!
You'd better shimmy on up
Well, I do apologize, madam, but
won't the feline eventually tire
of his lonely perch
and, pining for his master's affection,
return on his own initiative?
Uh, the point being,
must we actually ascend the tree?
Look, I don't want no doubletalk
Now, if you not gon' fetch him,
I guess I gotta call the police
- Police?
- And they not goin' be happy
Every time they have to fetch him,
they swear they'll never do it no more
No need to call the authorities, madam
I did this often as a child
I was a positive lemur
Here, kitty!
- Oh, don't upset him now!
- I wouldn't think of it, madam
Harmless little Felix domesticus
Here, Kitty
Come to G
Come, come
Here, kitty
Come, come, come
No, no, no
That's not how Sheriff Wyner do it
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come, come, come
Come to the professor
Yes
Ah!
Uh thank you, madam,
for your act of kindness
- Well, you let him out
- I certainly did,
and for that I apologize no end
Allow me to present myself,
um, formally
Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, Ph
Like Elmer?
- I beg your pardon, ma'am?
- Fudd
No, no, Ph is a mark of
academic attainment
bestowed, in my case, in recognition of
my mastery of the antique languages
of Latin and Greek
I also hold a number of other advanced
degrees, including the baccalaureate
from a school in Paris, France,
called the Sorbonne
Sore bone
Well, that fits
You ever study at Bob Jones University?
I have not had that privilege
Oh, that's a Bible school
Only the finest in the country
- I send 'em $5 every month
- That is very generous
- I'm on the mailin' list! I'm a Angel
- Are you? Yes
Oh, they list my name in
the newsletter every issue
- Do they?
- Oh, I got the literature right over here,
- if you'd like to examine it
- Perhaps when my head has
recovered from its, uh
uh, buffeting
Mrs Munson, are you at all curious
as to why I darkened your door,
as the expression would have it,
on this lovely, lovely
camellia-scented morn?
Well, I was wonderin' till
you let Pickles out
- I quite understand
- Then in all the excitement
The fact is, I saw the sign in your window
advertising a room to let?
And there are no other such signs
among the houses
- on this charming, charming street
- Yeah, I got a room
$15 a week
I'm lookin' for a quiet tenant
Madam, you are addressing
a man who is quiet
and yet not quiet
If I may offer a riddle
I am currently on sabbatical from
the institution where I teach,
the University of Mississippi
at Hattiesburg
I am takin' a year off to
indulge my passion,
and I do not believe that is
too strong a word,
- for the music of the Renaissance
- Mm-hm
I perform in, and have the honor of
directing, a period-instrument ensemble
that performs at Renaissance Fairs
and other cultural fora
throughout central and southern
Mississippi
We perform on the instruments for which
the music was originally composed
Now, wait a minute
You got some kind of band?
Oh, no The word "band" would be,
in this context, something of a misnomer
Though we do play together,
hence the word "ensemble",
the nature of the music is such that,
well, one would hesitate to apply
the epithet "band"
- with connotations of janglin' rhythms
- So y'all ain't playin' no hippity-hop?
"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo"
Songs with the titles spelled all funny?
Oh, no, no We play music that has been
composed to the greater glory of God
Devotional music
Church music
Gospel music?
Well, inspired by the gospel, certainly
The vintage, of course,
is no more recent than the Rococo
Rococo, huh?
Well, I guess that'd be OK
But I don't propose to inflict
our rehearsals on you
May I inquire,
do you have a root cellar?
Ah
Yes, yes
This looks promising
A little dank, ain't it?
Indeed
That only improves the acoustics
Marvelous
Yes Ah!
Oh, these earthen walls
are ideal for baffling
the higher registers of the, uh
lute or sackbut
That is why so much music
of the cinquecento was played in crypts
and catacombs
This is perfect
- I can scarcely contain my glee
- Oh, you containin' it OK
You gotta peel this shit out, man
Sometimes it stick to the bottom
Hey, this shit smells like piles
You wouldn't even believe this, man
Even out here on the casino floor
you gonna find goddamn
mercy pads, Tucks
I don't know what the fuck people be
doin' here while they gamblin'
Man, I ain't peelin' no funky shit
with my human hands
That ain't nothin' but a prescription
for diseases and viruses
- and shit attackin' your fuckin' insides
- Oh, well, shit, you gotta do it,
'cause Mr
This tunnel leads back onto the land
for all the people that work for Mannex
Mannex Corporation They own
the Bandit Queen, three other boats
Now, this is where they think on their
corporate shit, Gudge and them
I mean, the light's as ugly as all hell,
but, shit, ain't as many Tucks
- Let me in, motherfucker!
- What's the password?
Kiss my ass!
Now, this is where they count
the dough Now, if you try to take any of it,
Elron over there'll shoot yo' ass
Goddamn!
Dawg, this is a motherfuckin' pigsty, man!
You are a squeakyass,
motherfuckin' pig!
Man, look at your ass
You got Cocoa Krispies on your uniform
Got breakfast there, and you still eatin'
goddamn lunch, man
I swear to God, if that ass was nickels,
you'd be a motherfuckin' millionaire
Spread out, boy
You a disgraceful fucka!
You is a fat motherfucker, man!
I swear
Hey, Mr
- How you doin' this mornin'?
- I'm doin' fine
- All right
- So, how's the new man?
Oh, shit, he a cleanin' motherfucker, man
- Is that a fact?
- What's up, my nigga?
Cut! Cut, cut, cut!
Goddamn it, his canteen fell off
Props!
- The goddamn thing's canteen fell off
- OK
Mountain, put Otto into the apparatus
- What the hell is this?
- World War I vintage gas mask
It's authentic Strapped on,
of course, so it can't fall off
Now, the animal is free to be
as active as he wants
It doesn't inhibit his movement
in any way, and
I think it really sells the whole
doughboy thing
- It looks like a fucking joke
- Uh, you're absolutely right
The gas mask is a whimsical concept
How the hell does it eat when it gets to
the Nibbles Ready-to-Eat?
- Well, you're absolutely right
- Don't let the clients see this
- Or that Humane fucker
- No, of course not
They'll just shut the fuckin' spot down,
Pancake
shut the fuckin' spot down, OK?
Put the goddamn canteen back on
the dog That says he's a soldier!
Dented tin canteen
All right? Strap it to his fucking collar!
Easiest thing in the world
I-I just thought
What?
Good concept
- What's he doing?
- Well, he's, uh
- Just breathe normally, Otto
- The fucking dog can't breathe
Oh, no, he can breathe
Eh, eh, that thing is
- Just breathe normally, Otto
- The fuckin' dog can't breathe
The fuckin' dog cannot breathe!
OK? Get the fu
Get that fuckin' thing off of him
Of course
Easiest thing in the world
I don't have my Leatherman Mountain,
give me your Leatherman Chop, chop!
Chitra! Make sure that Humane fucker
doesn't come over here, OK?
Distract him
He'll shit if he sees this
There we go

I know you all remember that when
Moses came down the mountain
carrying the Word of God,
come down that Sinai peak,
- he caught them Israelites red-handed
- Yes!
What'd he catch 'em doin'?
He caught 'em worshippin'
- a golden calf
- Yes!
He caught 'em worshippin'
a false god
He caught them Israelites in decline
In decline!
What did Moses do when he saw those
declinin', backslidin',
never-mindin' sinners?
What did he do?
Mosses smote those sinners
in his wrath! Yes, he did!
Y'all know what "smote" is?
I smite, you smite, he smites,
we done smote!
To smite is to go upside the head!
Because sometimes, brothers and sisters,
that's the only way!
The only way
To smite is to remind
we got to stop that decline
and scramble back up to the face
of the Almighty God!
- Amen!
- Instead of worshippin'
that golden calf, that earthly trash
on that garbage island
That garbage island in the shadowland,
wa-a-ay
way outside the Kingdom of God!
That garbage island,
where scavenger birds feast
on the bones of the backslidin' damned!
And so
let us pray
My dear lady, I do so hope this is not
an inopportune time for our first practice
Somebody die?
I beg your pardon? Oh!
No, no, no
No, I'm not bereaved
Though it is so kind of you to inquire
The hearse is simply a vehicle
commodious enough to accommodate
all the members of our ensemble
And, of course, our instruments contrived
in an age ignorant of miniaturization
Allow me to introduce my friends,
my colleagues,
these devoted and passionate musicians
Ain't no smokin' in this house
Oh
Sorry
What do you think, General?
Present any problems?
Good then Gentlemen, why don't we
crowd around and go over the plan?
Gentlemen, this is the Bandit Queen
Gambling den
Sodom of the Mississippi Delta
and the focus of our little exercise
Here is Orchard Street
Here is the residence of Marva Munson,
the charming lady whom you all met
moments ago
Gentlemen, I'm sure you're all aware
that the Solons of the state of
Mississippi, to wit, its legislature,
have decreed that no gaming
establishment shall be erected
within its borders upon dry land
They may, however, legally float
While the gambling activity is restricted
to these riverboats, no such restrictions
apply to the functions ancillary
to this cash-besotted business
The casino's offices, locker rooms,
facilities to cook and clean, and,
most importantly, its counting houses,
the reinforced, secret,
super-secure repositories of the lucre,
may all be situated
- Gawain, where is "wherever"?
- Say what?
- Where's the money?
- Oh
OK, look
At the end of every shift,
pit boss brings the cash down to
the hold of the ship in a locked cashbox,
and once a day all the cash is moved
down to the countin' room
And where is the counting room?
Uh it be right there in that square
where you pointin'
And what,
to flog a horse that if not dead
is at this point in mortal danger of expiring,
does this little square represent?
Offices
Ha!
Underground! Mmm!
Underground
During the casino's hours of operation,
the door to this counting room
is fiercely guarded
The door itself is of redoubtable
Pittsburgh steel
When the casino closes this entire
underground complex is locked up,
and the armed guard
retreats to the casino's main entrance
There, then, far from the guard,
reposes the money,
behind a five-inch-thick steel portal, yes
But the walls
the walls are but humble masonry
behind which is only the soft,
loamy soil deposited over centuries
by the Old Man,
the meanderin' Mississippi,
as it fanned its way back and forth across
the great alluvial plain, leaving earth
This earth
The General here, whose
curriculum vitae comprehends
massive tunnelin' experience through
the soil of his native French Indochina,
shall be directin'
our little old tunnelin' operation
Garth Pancake, though a master of none,
is a jack of all those trades
corollary to our aim
He will be doin' such fabricatin'
and demolition work
- as our little caper shall require
- Happy to be on board
Gawain is our proverbial "inside man"
He has managed to secure himself a berth
on the custodial staff of the Bandit Queen
- Damn skippy!
- And this brings us to Lump
To look at Lump, you might wonder
what specialized expertise
could he possibly offer
our merry little old band of miscreants
Well, gentlemen,
in a project of such risks,
it is imperative to enlist the services of a
hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute
Someone who will be our security,
our battering ram, our blunt instrument
And, on our behalf,
I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome
- Fuckin' A
- Whassup, my nigga?
Well, gentlemen, here you are
Men of different backgrounds
and differing talents
Men with, in fact,
but two things in common:
One, you all saw fit to answer my
advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar,
and two, you're all going to be,
in consequence,
very, very, incredibly
Let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen
Let us make beautiful music together,
and, by all means,
let us keep this to ourselves
What we say in this root cellar,
let it stay in this root cellar
There's no "l" in "team"
It's OK
No
Not at all, madam
Not at all We were about to
take a break anyway
The glissandi on this particular piece
are technically very, very demanding,
and I'm sure we would all welcome
a moment of R and R
Well, I just thought
maybe you'd like to see
What have you gotten into, honey?
Why you sweatin' like that?
Uh
Uh, eh, 'cause, 'cause
That boy right there?
He plays one bitch barrel
full of a sackbut!
- Ain't that right, Lump?
- Uh-huh
I'm tellin' you, he can tear it up
Right, Lump?
Ain't nobody play the sackbut
like Lump right there
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Don't be shy, Lump
Don't be shy
at it like it was some pussy!
- Oh, shit!
- Mind your mouth!
This is a Christian house, boy
No hippity-hop language in here
- Sometime it's the only way
- Now listen, you ain't gonna hit me
I'm tryin' to help you, boy, better yourself!
And so you should, madam
So you should
Gawain is so far transported
by his love of the music of
the early Renaissance
Don't make me no never-mind,
he transported!
- I understand
- You been smokin'?
Oh, certainly not, ma'am
I understand your indignation, ma'am
And I was offering an explanation,
not an excuse
- I myself am
- Hey, hey, hey
don't be explainin' me, dawg!
You can't read
my motherfuckin' mind, man!
You might got yo' Ph,
but I got my GED!
- Yes
- Nigga!
A fiery lad
A fact often remarked upon
by the poets of the Romantic era
My youth, I was in church
I wasn't walkin' around fiery
Youth ain't no excuse for nothin'
Anyhow, I just came to show you the fife
Othar's fife
I thought maybe, you bein'
a man of music, you'd be interested
Oh, indeed I am
Cut it hisself and burned his holes
The Israelites called it a khalil
Yeah, you can read all about it in
the Bible
Indeed not
Gone these 20 years
He was some kind of man
Blowed the khalil
I don't suppose Othar ever turned his hand
or, or turned his lip
to blowing the shofar?
The ceremonial ram's horn
sounded by the priests of the Hebrews
No, I don't know nothin' about that
Othar never blowed no shofar!
- Of course not
- Not to the extent of my knowledge
The khalil was good enough
for my Othar
He was some kind of man
Some kind of man
Oh, goddamn! Come on, girl,
let me get one little peek
Don't be cruel
Come on, just one butt cheek
Pull that ass out and make it clap
Aw, just 'cause I'm dressed like a janitor,
don't mean you gotta do me dirty
This muthafucka's hit the jackpot
Come on, girl
Come over here and blow on these dice
You know, I'm a seven on the roll now,
but I'm a 10 the hard way,
and I ain't just talkin' crap
Mr Gudge, she had a ass
that could pull a bus
I mean, Gudge, it was more than an ass,
it was literature
Yeah, I don't care how big her ass was,
MacSam
You say what?
There is no fraternizing with customers
on the Bandit Queen
- Clean out your locker
- But, Mr
I said get outta here
You're fired
You can't fire me!
I'll sue your ass!
Sue me?
For what?
For fuckin' punitive damages, man!
- Punitive damages
- Yeah
Punitive damages
You goddamn skippy!
- Punitive damages
- I see why you firin' me, Mr
Yeah, it's simple and plain
You firin' me 'cause I'm black
MacSam, everybody
on the custodial staff is black
Your replacement is gonna be black
His replacement, no doubt, will be black!
Well, the fuckin' judge is goin' be black,
muthafucka
- Oh
- And you?
- You gon' stand tall before the man
- Oh
And your replacement's gonna be black,
- muthafucka!
- Thank you
Oh, my
Oh, my, my, my,
my, my, my, my
This is a severe setback
I am distraught
I'm more than distraught
I am devastated
I-I'm beside myself
I'm at a positive loss for words
- You still talkin' OK, though
- Have you all decided?
Madam, we must have waffles
We must all have waffles forthwith
We must all think
We must all have waffles
and think, each and every one of us,
to the very best of his ability
Perhaps if you apologized to the man
and gave him flowers
Or perhaps a fruit basket
with a card depicting a misty seascape
and inscribed with a sentiment
I ain't apologizin' to that muthafucka
He fired me 'cause I'm black!
He can't do that
Open and shut case
- Fuckin' A
- Surely a chocolate assortment
has been known to melt the heart
of even the hardest misanthrope
That man ain't rollin' over
for no fucking candy bar
Uh, we've had a bit of a setback
on the tunneling front, too
- We've run into a pretty large rock
- Rock!
- Very bad
- Oh, my
Seems that the poet was right
Troubles never singly come
Oh, no, we can get through the rock
No worries there
Easiest thing in the world
Why, we just blow right through it
I got a pyro license
Just, uh, bore a hole in the rock
and pack in a little plastique
Igneous blows pretty good
- And then we could
- Hello, Garth
- Am I ordering the primer cord?
- Yes, Mountain
We were just talking about that,
and some plastique
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, this is Mountain Girl
Mountain is my right hand
She helps me out with ordnance
- Helps me with
- Hey
You brought yo' bitch to the Waffle Hut?
I must confess myself
to be puzzled as well
I thought it was understood that
when it came to our little enterprise,
"mum" was the word
Of course, I understand that,
but this is Mountain Girl
I don't keep secrets from Mountain
That's not how you maintain a loving,
caring relationship
You brought yo' bitch to the Waffle Hut!
The man brought his bitch
to the Waffle Hut!
All right, look, you, I will thank you
to stop referring to Mountain that way
She is the other half of my life
Everybody lookin' at me like I'm some kind
of fuck-up for losin' a sorry-ass job,
and this muthafucka brings his bitch
- to the muthafuckin' Waffle Hut!
- Son-of-a-bitch punk!
- Shut your goddamn mouth!
- You better raise the fuck up, fucka!
- Gentlemen, please
- Back the fuck up!
You gon' back that shit the fuck up!
- Gentlemen, please
- What?! What?!
Please, gentlemen, this behavior does you
no credit in the eyes of your colleagues,
nor in those of the other patrons
of this Waffle Hut
Little punk
Oh, look at this
I got blueberry syrup on my safari jacket!
Gentlemen, I propose that we consider
the matter of this woman,
- Mountain Water
- Mountain Girl
I'm so very sorry I propose
that we consider this matter closed
And we shall choose to trust her
since we have no choice,
and since she shall share only
in Mr
Of course
Wouldn't have it any other way
- Yeah, you damn right you won't
- Up yours, punk
- Oh, fuck you and the Swiss Miss
- The matter of disposing
- of our igneous impediment is also
- C-Coach
- C-C-Coach, I
That leaves us only with the question
of Gawain retrieving his job
- Coach, I
- Yes, Lump?
Couldn't we just bribe the guy?
You are a readin' fool,
aren't you, Mr Dorr?
Yes, I must confess
I often find myself more at home
in these ancient volumes
than I do in the hustle-bustle
of the modern world
To me, paradoxically, the literature
of the so-called "dead tongues"
holds more currency
than this morning's newspaper
In these books, in these volumes,
there is the accumulated wisdom
of mankind, which succors me
when the day is hard
and the night lonely and long
Mm The wisdom of mankind, huh?
- What about the wisdom of the Lord?
- Oh
Yes, yes
I have found reward in its pages
But, to me, there are other
good books as well
Heavy volumes of antiquity freighted
with the insights of man's glorious age
And then, of course, I just love, love, love
the works of Mr
Oh, I know who he was
Kinda spooky
No, madam, no, no
Not of this world, it's true
He
An ancient dream
"Helen,
Thy beauty is to me
Like those Nicean barks of yore,
That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,
The weary, wayworn wanderer bore
To his own native shore"
Who was Helen?
- Some kinda whore of Babylon?
- One doesn't know who Helen was
but I picture her as being very, very
extremely
pale
Mrs Munson, I have been trying
to figure out some way of
expressin' my gratitude to you
for takin' in this weary, wayworn wanderer
It's just a little old present
Why, it's hardly anything at all
Oh, why, Mr Dorr!
You are a gallant man
Oh, madam, I blush, I melt
No
I just happened to hear
of this gospel concert tomorrow night,
"The Mighty, Mighty Clouds of Joy",
and I thought you and a friend
from church perhaps would?
- Yes, I have a widow lady friend
- The concert is up in Memphis,
so I have arranged a car service
to transport you thither
Ah?
Why, Sheriff Wyner!
How you doin'?
Good evenin', Mrs
I just stopped by here to let you know
I did have a talk with Weemack,
and he told me he's gonna comply
with your request
in keepin' that music down
and neighborly
So you just go and have yourself
a pleasant evenin'
Wait a minute
I got somebody that I want you to meet
Uh, ma'am, you know what? I'm
I'm a little pressed for time
You got a gang of bank robbers
youse chasin'?
Come on in here and say hello
Yeah, we was in here, havin' tea and
Huh!
Bussed his own dishes
You can always tell a gentleman
- Somebody was in here, ma'am?
- Yeah, with me and Othar
Well, you know what?
Maybe I'll catch him the next time
Oh, come on up to his room
with me and say hello
I got a family
My wife got dinner on the table
I really have to be goin'
- Oh, my He is neat!
- Yes, ma'am, he very neat
He probably went down to the cellar
to play with his friends
Ma'am, I really got to be goin' now
- What?
- Ma'am, I really need to be gettin' back
Mrs
You don't have to
Mrs Munson?
Why, Professor!
What in the world are you doin'
havin' tea down there?
Uh Munson?
Oh, Lord Jesus
- Mrs Munson?
- Land of Goshen, child!
- Come on out from under there!
- Mrs
I got to go
I'll meet you and your friend later
That was refreshing
Y'all have a good evenin' now!
As you know, we academics are
inordinately fond of wedgin' ourselves
- into confined spaces
- Mm!
At Yale, the students will see how many
of their number they can enclose
in a telephone booth
At Harvard, a broom closet
Oh! Hope I didn't spill my tea
Well, what the hell is this?
I guess it's just my way of sayin', um
Oh, well, goddamn it, Mr
Look here, I
I don't know what it's like
walkin' in your shoes
You know, with you bein'
a tight-ass and all
And I'm pretty sure you don't know
what it's like walkin' in my shoes
See, Mr Gudge,
there's the custodian, right?
And then there's the man
inside the custodian
And that's the motherfucker
we got a problem with
See, 'cause that man,
he got needs, Mr Gudge,
and normally those needs
gotta do with women with big asses
I guess my point bein' is
I realize I'm a bunkie junkie
But if you woulda seen the kettle drums
on this girl, Mr Gudge, whew!
Well
This apology buys you
a one-week probationary period
Thank you, Mr
Stay away from the customers,
MacSam
This drill bit's getting awfully hot
Gawain, maybe you could fill a Hudson
sprayer and spritz it down while I drill
Fuck you I ain't your motherfuckin'
house nigger
All right, look, are you gonna have
a bug up your ass
for the rest of the time we
work together?
- I'll get the sprayer
- Oh, no, no
Me and this gentleman here
have to get square
Let me tell you somethin', MacSam
I'm gonna tell you about
how I came down to Mississippi
I wasn't born here, you know
I'm from Scranton, Pennsylvania
What the fuck?
Scranton
Came down here in 1964
With the Freedom Riders
Do you know who
the Freedom Riders were, MacSam?
No, and I don't give a fuck
Just tell me when the fuck
they gonna leave Damn!
The Freedom Riders,
my fine young man,
were a group of concerned liberals
from up north,
all working together,
just like we are here
Involved citizens who came down here
so that local black folk
could have their civil liberties
So that people like you
could have the vote
- You know what, man?
- What, brother?
- I don't vote
- You little fuckin' ingrate
- And the bus you rode in on, jackass!
- Let's step outside, MacSam!
Fuck the outside!
Come on! What?!
My friend Mrs Funthes is here,
so I'm about to go out
Just thought I'd leave y'all
with some cinnamon cookies
Why, that is lovely
Ooh, y'all sound good!
Maybe you could come by
the church one Sunday
- give us a recital
- Why, how kind of you!
Our music, however, is, uh
well, how shall I put this?
Uh, a bit Roman in its outlook
Uh, many of our pieces were
commissioned by the Holy See
Oh, I see, all right,
but we don't make no big
whoop-dee-do about denomination
Everybody welcome at our church
Yeah, we had a Methodist come in
Episcopalian Back in the '60s,
we had a Jew come in!
- He had a guitar
If you will excuse me one moment, madam,
I shall, uh, I shall see you out
If you gentlemen can labor harmoniously
in the course of my absence,
perhaps upon my return
we shall be prepared to explode
that vexin' old piece of igneous
Oh, Professor!
This is Mrs
Rosalie, this is Professor
G
Oh, my
Oh, well, no
Of course, in my youth,
I was known simply as Goldthwait
Uh-huh
All right, safety meeting
Let's listen up General,
can you hand me the primer cord?
Before we set the charge,
we will run through our procedure
I have earplugs for whoever wants them
Just wedge those right in your ears
Now, here we have
Not yet, Lump
- Oh
- Now, primer cord
Gelatinite
Time comes, we pack the hole
in the rock with the C-4
and insert two leads: A and B
I remember my father sayin' to me -
and it's one of the few memories
I retain of the man
from one of his visits home,
and how I do cherish it -
he said to me, "Goldthwait,
you are not formed as other boys"
He a man of learnin'?
This is the same procedure we will
be using when we collapse the tunnel
after entering the casino vault
and returning to the root cellar
He was a self-educated man
Didn't have a career as such,
but the government did recognize
the breadth of his readin'
by makin' him librarian
of the state nervous hospital in Meridian,
where he was a distinguished inmate
Once these materials are combined
only the professionals may handle them
That means me or the General
Separately they are harmless,
completely inert
Why, you could light this stuff on fire,
hit it with a ham
What in the name of
heavens was that?
Well, um I'm quite certain there's
absolutely no reason to be alarmed
Why, I'm not even absolutely certain
I heard anything at all
Didn't hear nothin'?!
Well, something perhaps
Nothing that need discompose us
was the sense I was tryin' to convey
Now, Mrs Munson, I will not have you
missin' your musical recital Off you go!
I shall call the gas company,
or the water company
Whatever subterranean utility
is implicated in this contretemps
I shall see to the matter,
as only a highly educated classicist could
Blood! Blood, Professor, blood!
Blood, blood, blood!
It's perfectly all right
Jackass! You better get yo' ass back
down there and find that shit, dipshit!
- Really, I'm perfectly all right
- Perfectly all right?
Jackass, you just blew
your goddamn finger off!
The muthafucka down there
flappin' the fuck around!
You better get yo' ass
back down there and find it!
I'm tellin' you right now, nubbie,
I ain't pickin' up your goddamn finger!
I gather there was a premature detonation
Would you tell this muthafucka
he can sew this shit back on?!
It's like that dude whose wife cut
his dick off, threw it on the freeway?
She just called Triple A,
they towed the dick
and sewed the muthafucka back on!
Listen up! Jackass,
I saw the muthafucka in a porno!
The thang still worked!
It looked like a chewed-up frank,
but that little muthafucka
be workin' that muthafucka!
It's mangly, but he be fuckin' the bitch
all kind of ways with a twisted dick!
Oh! Your fuckin' finger just moved!
The muthafucka movin' slow now!
I'm not gettin' that shit
Fuck that! You're on your own there!
They usin' the house
to practice music
Mmm-hm
I propose we get our fallen comrade
to the hospital
The General will follow when
he manages to recover the severed digit
No, no, really, I'm perfectly all right
I don't know what all the fuss is about
- Good news! Good news!
- Pickles! Go get him!
The house is in apple-pie order,
though we do have to get
medical attention for Mr Pancake,
who, durin' the disturbance, pinched
his finger in the valve of his sackbut
You let the cat out!
Wha? The General is even now
exercisin' every effort in retrievin'
your mischievous little Pickles
Please, go on
Go on and enjoy the concert!
Driver!
Despite our setback,
we find ourselves on schedule
to penetrate the vault here this afternoon,
while Mrs Munson is at church,
havin' blasted that little old rock to pieces
durin' Mrs
Garth, can you run us through the
game plan for what remains of our tunnel?
Of course
Easiest thing in the world
Only a couple of feet
separate us from the vault
Just the usual spadework
until we get to the masonry of the vault,
and then we just drill through
And will you be able to wield the drill
with your maimed extremity?
Oh, well, yeah, I should think so
Yeah, it's, uh, it's only one finger
Inhibits me in doing finer work of course
I'll always have to live with that
Maybe - I'm just thinkin' out loud here -
maybe, since as you say
there will be problems later,
maybe - and I actually mentioned this
to Mountain Girl, she agrees with me,
so it's not just one person's opinion -
maybe, uh
I should get a little extra compensation
for the accident
Somewhat larger share
Why, if this was any other line of work,
I'd be getting workman's comp
Wouldn't I?
Might even have a pretty good lawsuit
Wait, so you gonna sue yourself
for blowing your own goddamn finger off?
- Well, now that is simply asinine
- Yes, but you see, Garth,
this is not what you just called
"some other line of work"
Yeah, no, no, no, but if it were
This is a criminal enterprise,
not to put too fine a point on it,
entailing any manner of risk
not involved in honest labor
Governmental regulations
and civic safeguards
cannot be assumed to apply
to antisocial pursuits
- Yeah, but he lost his finger
- We don't give a fuck!
That fool could blow his goddamn dick off,
it don't make no nevermind to us!
We not payin' this jackass for goin' around
blowin' off goddamn body parts!
Get yo' fuckin' head out yo' ass, man!
Look you, there is no call for
No extra share!
OK
Like I say, it was just a trial balloon
Hand's not so bad really
I even get some phantom feeling
Yeah, you pull on your prick,
you get some phantom feelin'
- Fuck you
- Fuck you
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, nubbie!
Well, now that that matter is settled,
why don't we synchronize our watches
before Gawain reports to work
In 20 seconds, it will be exactly 12:16
- Fifteen
- What, it'll be 12:15?
No, 15 seconds
lt'll be 12:16
- Eight, seven
- Professor? Prof?
- Professor?
Yes, Lump!
I don't have a watch
There'll be no more
weepin' and wailin'
No more weepin' and wailin'
No more weepin' and wailin'
Home to live with God
Oh
Soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world
Troubles of this world
Troubles of this world
Oh, soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world
I'm goin' home to live with God
Soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world
Troubles of this world
Troubles of this world
Troubles of this world
Soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world
I'm goin' home to live with God
Well, soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world
Troubles of this world
Troubles of this, great God!
Soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world
I'm goin' home to live with God
Well, I'm goin' up to see King Jesus
Hey, hey, yeah!
I'm gonna shake His loving hand
I'm gonna tell Him all about my trouble
As I'm travelin' through this land!
Oh, soon I will be done
Troubles of this world
Yeah, soon I will be done
I'm goin' home to live with God
Yeah, soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world
Troubles of this world
Yeah, soon I will be done
with the troubles, yeah
I'm goin' home to live with God
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Ain't that somethin'!
- I
- You be what?
Irritable Bowel Syndrome!
Is there a men's room down here?
Oh, come on You shouldn't be usin'
the men's room now!
Or a lady's room
I
If you knew you had the runs,
why didn't you shit back at the house?
Quickly!
We don't want Elron finding
your stinkin' ass on the crapper!
No choice
It's a medical condition Quickly!
You one disgustin' individual,
you know that?
Come on
Follow me
I feel 30 pounds lighter
- Come the fuck on with your stinkass
- Thank you for being so understanding
Not everyone is, of course, which is why
the biggest challenge of I
is educating the public
Afflicts over two million people,
yet most of us have never heard of it
And it strikes without regard to age,
gender or race
Oh, fuck, man,
I don't wanna hear about this shit
Well, that's exactly the kind
of attitude we're fighting
I guess I never told you that's how
Mountain Girl and I met
They had an I weekend
at Grossinger's up in the Catskills
Of course, the tourist business
there has suffered
with the demise of the Borscht Belt,
so they have various promotions,
mixers, so on
This was a weekend for Irritable Bowel
singles to meet and support each other
- and share stories
- Man, look here,
I don't want to hear
a single one of them stories, OK?
- Now, some of them are very moving
- Not one fucking story!
- Look, I didn't choose to have I
- Man, shut the fuck up!
There's no cure, you know
Only control
Yeah, you know what?
Bein' an asshole's a lifelong condition, too
Just drop the fuckin' tools
I'm not complaining
I did meet Mountain Girl
Man, get back in the fuckin' hole!
Oh!
This way! This way, gentlemen!
Oh! Excellent! Excellent
Flawless, flawless
Can't stop shittin'
Can't stop talkin' about shittin'
Gentlemen, to we few We who have
shared each other's company,
each other's cares, each other's joys,
and who shall now reap the fruits
of our communal efforts,
shoulder to shoulder,
from each according to his abilities,
so forth and whatnot
We have had our little differences
along the way,
but I'd like to think that they've only
made us value one another all the more
Each of us coming to understand
and appreciate
the other's unique qualities
and potencies and, yes, foibles
I suggest that we shall
look back upon this little caper one day,
one distant day,
grandchildren dandled upon our knee,
and perhaps a tear will form
and we shall say,
"Well, with wit and grit
and no small amount of courage,
we accomplished something on that day,
a feat of derring-do,
an enterprise not ignoble"
We merry band, unbound
by the constraints of society
and the prejudices of the common ruck
We happy few
- Gentlemen, to us!
To us!
Charge shoulda gone off already
I do beg your pardon?
The charge to collapse the tunnel
I set it for eight minutes
Well, that much time and more
has certainly elapsed
I need not remind you,
it is of the essence of this plan
that the money should appear to have
simply vanished without a trace,
- spirited away, as it were, by ghosts
- Of course
The conundrum of the undisturbed,
yet empty vault,
the unsolvable riddle
of the sealed yet violated sanctum,
is of the utmost importance,
not only to make our caper
more intellectually satisfying,
it is exigent as a matter of practical fact
I remind you that if any tunnel
is ever found leading to this house,
the owner knows all your names
You just fart?
Nope, nope, I'm fine
Perfectly all right! Not a problem!
There's no hole left
Professor!
I'm surprised!
Well properly speaking, madam,
we are surprised
Though I do acknowledge
that the sense that you intend
is gaining increasing currency
through its use, yes
You have returned from
your devotions betimes
I had to make tea
I want to talk to you, Professor,
so don't you be leavin'!
And you! I told you I don't want
any smokin' in this house!
Oh, come on in!
How you doin'?
Tea, ladies
Now, I don't know what
you boys been up to,
but I know mischief when I see it
Now, I want an explanation, but first,
I want you to get your fannies up here
with all y'all's period instruments
Now, I been tellin' the ladies about your
music, and they want to hear you play
- Professor?
- Yes, Lump?
I can't really play the buttsack
Madam, or rather, mesdames,
you must accept our apologies
for not bein' able to perform,
for, as you see, we are shorthanded
Gawain is still at work,
and we could no more play
with one part tacit
than a horse could canter shy one leg
Perhaps I could offer,
as a poor but ready substitute,
a brief poetic recital
Though I do not pretend
to any great oratorical skills,
I would be happy to present,
with your ladies' permission,
verse from the unquiet mind
of Mr
"Ladies, thy beauty is to me
Like those Nicean barks of yore,
That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,
The weary, wayworn wanderer bore
To his own native shore"
- My, my, my
"On desperate seas long wont to roam,
Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
To the glory that was Greece
And the grandeur that was Rome"
Amen!
Hm?
It was
Such a pleasure
Safe home
- Now I want to know what's goin' on
- Oh, indeed, indeed
The thirst for knowledge
is a very commendable thing
Though I do believe that when you hear
the explanation you shall laugh riotously,
slappin' your knee and perhaps even
wipin' away a giddy tear,
relieved of your former concern
Lump here is an avid collector
of Indian arrowheads,
and having found one
simply lying on your cellar floor -
- a particularly rare artifact
of the Natchez tribe? -
Nats what?
He enlisted the entire ensemble in
an all-out effort to sift through the subsoil
in search of others
And apparently, in doing so,
we hit a mother lode of natural gas
I myself became acutely aware
of the smell of "rotten eggs"
And it was just at this inopportune moment
that the General here
violated the cardinal rule of this house
- and lit himself a cigarette
- So sorry
Well, what about all that money?
Ah
The money
Well, the money is Mr
- Who only just remortgaged his home
in order to raise the money
for a surgical procedure
that will correct the wandering eye
of his common-law wife, Mountain Water,
who suffers from astigmia, strabismus
and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly
Mr Pancake is an ardent foe
of the Federal Reserve,
and is, in fact, one of those eccentrics
one often reads about
hoardin' his entire life savings,
in Mr Pancake 's case, in a Hefty bag
that is his constant companion
- The Steel Sak
- Don't trust the banks
Mm-mn
It don't smell right to me
- I'm callin' Sheriff Wyner
- No! Madam!
Please, please
Madam!
No, no, I beg of
Yes! Yes!
It is a lie!
It is a fantastic tale!
You have us dead to rights,
but, madam, please, please, please
allow me to tell you the truth in private
Madam
Madam, we are not musicians
of the late Renaissance
- Nor of the early, nor mid period
- Mm-hm
We are, in fact,
criminals
Desperate men, Mrs
We have tunneled into the nearby offices
of the Bandit Queen gambling emporium
- and relieved it of its treasure
- Lord have mercy
It is true
The Bandit Queen is a den of iniquity,
a painted harlot luring people into sin
by exciting the vice of greed
with her promise of easy winnings
Oh, yes
Her gains are ill-gotten
But, I offer no excuses - save one
We men have each pledged
one half of our share of the booty
to a charitable institution
In compensation for the use of your home,
we had planned to donate a full share
to Bob Jones University,
without burdening you with guilty
knowledge by informing you of same
But now you have wrested
the information from me
There you have it
It is on your table, Mrs
The "awful truth"
- Stolen money
- But find the victim, Mrs
I challenge you Even the casino itself,
that riparian Gomorrah,
shall suffer no harm
It has an insurance company
A financial behemoth that will
cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults
That is its function
And that insurance company has tens
and tens of thousands of policyholders
So that We have done the calculations,
Mrs
So that at the end of the day,
at the final reckoning,
each and every one of those policyholders
shall have contributed one penny
One, single, solitary cent
to the satisfaction of this claim
- One penny?
- One penny
One penny from those thousands
upon thousands of people
so that Bob Jones University
can continue on its mission
Why, I have no doubt that,
were those policy holders made aware
of the existence of that august institution,
each and every one of them
would have volunteered some token
amount for the furtherance of its aims
Well, that's prob'ly true
Sadly, the criminal stain
is upon my soul,
but the benefit shall accrue
to any number of worthy causes
as long, that is, as the secret
stays with us
Well
I can't hardly see the harm in it
- One penny?
- I'm sorry
- Excuse me?
No, I'm sorry, it's wrong, and don't you
be leadin' me into temptation
- No, no, madam, I must strenuously
- I'm sorry, it's just plain wrong
- Stealin'!
- No, madam
- I know your intentions was good
- No, they weren't!
And I won't call the police
if you give back the money
and y'all go to church with me
next Sunday
And engage in divine worship?!
I've made up my mind
Now, you can doubletalk all you want
It's church or the county jail
Think it over
I gotta feed the cat
- Motherfuck!
- Yes
Unfortunately, Mrs Munson
has rather complicated the situation
Yeah, well, I know how to decomplicate it
You bust a cap in that old bitch's head,
everything be simple
Not easy to do
Many reasons
Practical ones:
Quiet neighborhood, sleepy town
Reasons of moral repugnance:
A harmless woman,
a deed conceived
and executed in cold blood
Oh, no, Gawain,
would that it were simple
Well, fuck, man! What we gonna do?
Give the money back and go to church?
I shudder
I quake
You, sir, are a Buddhist
Is there not a "middle" way?
Mm
Must float like a leaf on the river of life
Yes, yes, I suppose you are right
It is the active nature of the crime,
though, that so abhors
The squeezing of the trigger,
the plunging of the knife
But
What other tools do we have at hand?
We have the cellar
We have the cavity
We have masonry and trowel
Perhaps we could simply
Sure I can
whip up a little mortar in a snow saucer
Lay the bricks
Anchor in some chains
Mountain Girl could outsource
the manacles
Ah, gentlemen, gentlemen,
we delude ourselves
No, shortest and painless is best
Gawain's gun, retort muffled
by a pillow, into the brain
The affair of an instant
The only question is
who wields the weapon?
I believe it is traditional
in such circumstances to draw straws
Fair enough
Here you go, Lump
I'm thinkin', though,
that since I lost a finger -
- and I mean literally lost it
'cause of that fuckin' cat -
maybe I should be
excused from this thing
Hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway
You one whiny muthafucka
I'll come over there and squeeze your
fuckin' nutsack, you keep that bullshit up
Shut up, punk!
- I'll kick your goddamn ass, sweet-legs!
- Gentlemen!
No special pleading
No exceptions
It is of the nature of the situation
we would all prefer to be excused
Well, OK, it was just a trial balloon
Long straw
All that fuss for nothin', punk
Fuck you
Motherfuck!
- What you got there, Gawain?
- Why, nothin', Mama
Nothin', my ass!
You got a dog there!
- No, Mama
- A filthy, noisy little pest of a puppy dog
- gonna shit all over the house!
- He won't shit in the house, Mama
I'm gonna train him, I promise
I'll train him real good!
I'm gonna train you real good!
You wait till your daddy get home
He gonna lay into you proper!
No, Mama! Please, Mama! I love you!
Your daddy gonna kick yo' ass!
Mama's whuppin' Gawain's ass!
Ain't you gonna use the strap, Mama?
I love you, Mama
I'm sorry, Mama, I love you
Yeah, I'll wipe the dog's ass
and everything, Mama
I'll train him to shit in the toilet, Mama
- I'll wipe his ass and everything, Mama
- What you doin'?
What you doin' with my pillow?
Nothin', ma'am
I just came down to get a
- Ugh!
- I'm displeased with you!
- Yeah, but
- Fine colored boy like you
- fallin' in with that trash downstairs!
- Ugh!
Now, I know your mama
taught you better than that!
I can't do it
She remind me of my mama
- Look, man
- Why, this is most irregular
y'all muthafuckas
just gonna have to draw straws again
Wait a minute You've got to accept
your responsibilities, young man,
and shoot that old lady
Hey, man, fuck you
and your irritated bowel!
Must shoot
Now, look here,
it's the easiest thing in the world
Just pretend her head's a casaba melon
and the gun is a melon baller
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
A melon baller?
- Look, man, you do it
- Oh, this is most irregular
Now, look, with equal rights
comes equal responsibility
I'm afraid Mr
We cannot draw straws again
The exercise would lose all credibility
if you show the loser can simply beg off
Must shoot
Hey, look, man,
she's just an old colored lady to you
Come on, man, you do it
- Why, you sniveling little coward
- What did you say to me?
- Sniveling little coward
- You whiny muthafucka
I will come up yo' stankin',
irritated asshole with this gun
and give you a lead colonic,
muthafucka!
You think you scare me,
you mewling punk?
You don't scare me Bull Connor
and all his dogs didn't scare me!
Now, be a man
You fuck!
You ain't no fuckin' man!
- Oh, my, this is most distressin'
- Be a man!
You ain't no fuckin' man!
Fuckin' a 60-year-old with pigtails!
Why, you bastard punk!
Mountain Girl is 53!
- She could ride your ass to jelly!
- Oh, yeah?!
- Gentlemen, please!
- I seen Virginia hams
I'd rather stick my dick in
than that big ol' white chick!
Oh, my God
Oh, no
Oh, my
- I think he's hit
I'll just check the carotid artery
- That's a negative
- Is he dead, Professor?
Oh, sure he's dead, Lump
I just checked his carotid artery
We shall need a Hefty bag
She is in the kitchen
You steal out with the carcass
while I dazzle her with conversation
My dear Mrs Munson, I have outlined
your position with my colleagues,
and I now return to you
to render our collective verdict
There was much spirited discussion
and an atmosphere of frank give-and-take
Some of our number
were initially appalled at your proposal
that we simply return the money
Some were more receptive
I don't care if they was receptive or not!
And that attitude, madam,
was a factor in our discussions
To a man, I must say
they were devastated at the prospect
of not being able to contribute
to their respective charities
- Well, that is a shame
- Indeed,
but at the end of the day,
your position prevailed
So we have decided to return the money,
every last cent of it,
and attend Sunday services, rather than
spend the remainder of our days
wastin' away at the Mississippi
Men's Correctional Facility
Though that was the original
preference of some
You are not assistin' with the cadaver
Oh, no need
Just chuck it off the bridge
Easiest thing in the world
- I'm just cleanin' up here
Oh! That's them
Back already
I'll just go dump these in the hearse
Yeah, easiest thing in the world
General!
No extra share, huh?
- Mountain?
- Garth?
- I, dear?
Get Garth
Excellent I believe, at last,
we have the right man for the job
The old woman is a more formidable
antagonist than one had imagined
Now, Lump,
it falls to you to finish the job
- The comedy must end
- You know,
- I've been doin' some thinkin', Professor
- Oh, dear
Maybe we should be goin' to church
Maybe she is right
Ooh, dear, Lump
I feared those would be your words
Not that I don't appreciate you giving
the matter the benefit of your thought,
but recall, my dear boy,
our respective functions in this enterprise
I am a professor professor,
as you yourself so often say
Trained, in fact, in the arts of cogitation
You, Lump, are the goon,
the hooligan, the dumb brute,
whose actions must be directed
by a higher intelligence
Yeah, I know, but
Ah, ah, ah! No buts, dear boy
Do not repeat the error of thinkin'
Now is the moment of praxis
Now, Lump, you must act
Well, I can't do it, Professor
A nice old lady like that
Think of the riches, Lump,
that you and I alone shall divide
Yeah, I know, but
And reflect also that if you decline to act,
thus forcin' me to do so,
you shall no longer have
any entitlement to the money
Your offices shall have been nugatory
You mean you're gonna kill her?
Of course, yes
My hand shall be forced
I can't allow you to do that, Professor
allow?
- Mm-hm
Not allow?
What presumption!
You stupid boy!
You very, very, extremely stupid boy
Oh, yeah?
Who looks stupid now?
No bullets?
Perhaps it had to be thus
"Lo! In yon brilliant window-niche
How statue-like I see thee stand"
A raven
"The agate lamp within thy hand!"
"Ah, Psyche, from the regions which
Are Holy Land!"
Ugh!
Huh?
Uh-huh
Professor?
Mm, mm, mm!
Couldn't face the music
I appreciate that, but we don't know
what to do
Oh
- Uh, Mrs
- Gotta make a statement, Sheriff
Ma'am, could it possibly wait?
We're kinda busy down here today
Oh, well, I suppose it could wait,
but it's about that casino money
Let me call you back
You know somethin' about it?
Somethin'? Everything!
I got it at home
- You got what at home?
- The money! $1
- It's down in my root cellar
- How did it get there, Marva?
Well, a bunch of desperate men
stole it and put it there, that's how!
See, they was musicians
of the Renaissance period
Turned out
they really couldn't play,
but they could recite poems
that'd break your heart
- The ringleader spoke in dead tongues
- Does he now?
Oh, I tried to get you to see him
- That night
- Yes, ma'am
I had to holler at 'em
about stealin' all that money
And I guess I made 'em feel real bad,
'cause they just picked up and left
without takin' the money!
And they let Pickles out!
So you want us to come over
and fetch him
Oh, no, no, he's back
What you want me to do with the money?
You keep it!
Why don't you keep it?
- Keep it?
- Go on and keep it, Miss Marva
Well
It is just a penny off of everybody's policy
- Could?
- You don't suppose I could?
- Yes, ma'am?
Could I just give it all
to Bob Jones University?
Yeah
Give it all to 'em!
That's a good idea!
As long as everybody knows
How you doin'?
Pickles!
Oh, Lord, Pickles!
