It's fucking cold outside.
That guy on the radio said
it's going down to 34.
It's 34.
That's freezing, for chrissakes.
Yo, Chili.
What? You spacing?
They're closing down the Granville.
You know,
that theater down on Biscayne?
That guy owes Momo a couple G's.
I know. I was thinking
maybe Momo should buy it.
I could run it.
Show old Cagney movies.
Why would Momo want a theater
that shows movies no one wants to see?
Outside of making it a porno house,
he's not going to give a fuck.
I'm gonna go
talk to this Chili.
-Besides, you got a job.
-Yeah. Yeah.
How you doing, Ray?
Good. You?
Okay.
Can you believe this weather?
Miami Beach, for chrissakes!
Chili Palmer.
It's chilly outside,
and it's Chili inside.
It's a regular fucking chilifest.
How you doing?
Obviously much better
than you, Chili.
That was a good one.
When you're done staring
out the window...
I'll meet you
back at the office.
-Where's my coat?
-It's not one ofthese?
Do you see
a black leatherjacket...
like Pacino wore in ''Serpico''?
-'Cause ifyou don't, you owe me $379.
-See the sign?
I didn't come to Florida
to freeze my ass off.
Find my coat or give me the $379
my ex-wife paid for it.
Wait a minute.
Ray Bones took my coat?
No, he didn't take it.
He borrowed it.
'Cause someone took his coat.
So Mr. Barboni tried this other coat.
It fit him good.
That was my coat.
He was wearing it home.
He's not gonna keep it.
My car keys are in that coat.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.
He works forJimmy Capp.
I know who he works for.
Where's your phone?
This way.
Are you sure it was Ray Bones
that took the coat?
That's what the man said.
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather,
is going to be nice and warm.
-You don't need the coat.
-This is it.
Hey, Chili. Get the coat.
Just don't piss the guy off, okay?
Then we're gonna have to call Momo
and straighten the whole thing out.
And Momo'll be pissed off for wasting
his time. We don't need that, eh?
Don't worry. I'm not saying
any more than I have to, ifthat.
Yeah, yeah.
Just a minute.
What!
Are you fucking nuts?
My nose!
My nose!
Holy shit!
Somebody call 9-fucking-1 -1 !
Somebody call 9-fucking-1 -1 !
What do you want me to do?
Go to war over a fucking coat?
You're lucky
the guy didn't kill you.
The coat was a Christmas present,
for chrissakes.
Listen to me,Jimmy.
You gotta do something about this guy.
He's running amok.
He's got no fucking respect
for none of us.
He's got no respect foryou.
I don't got to do shit.
Chili Palmer don't work for me.
He works for Momo
up in Brooklyn.
As long as Momo's around,
nothing happens to Chili.
Do you understand?
Over here.
We're here, Momo.
lhopeyou checkedthisplace outgood,
'cause l'mgoing in there alone...
andldon't want
no fuckingsurprises.
lcheckedeverything, Momo.
Who is it?
It's Momo.
Get in here.
Surprise!
Soyou're trying to say
you're nevergoing to sleep again?
No, I said I'm never going to bed.
There's a difference.
This article says
that most people die in their beds.
As long as I stay
out of bed, I'm safe.
What? That's the dumbest thing I ever
heard of. Where you gonna sleep?
In my recliner.
You know, the tan one in the TV room?
Or I'll go to a coffee shop,
slide into a booth, pull my hat down.
How many people you know
died in a coffee shop?
You cut straight hair in here
orjust fags?
Hey, Bones. That's quite a scar
you got on your head.
Why don't you have these guys fit you
with a rug, cover it up foryou?
You two geezers
take your game to the park.
This man is the man. You understand
what I'm saying, motherfucker?
He's Mr. Bones,
and you speak to Mr. Bones from now on.
You can do better
than him, can't you?
Not these days.
Not unless you speak Spanish.
You got a miss.
Leo Devoe. He's six weeks over.
He's dead.
How do you know?
Did he tell you?
Yeah, he told me
that he was dead.
Personally?
Yeah, he personally told me
he got killed...
in that getawayjet crash
that happened a month ago.
Maybe he took out flight insurance.
Check with his wife.
You check it out.
It's your book now.
He owns some dry cleaning store
over on Federal Highway.
Let me explain something to you.
Momo is dead.
Which means everything he had now
belongs toJimmy Capp, including you.
Which also means that when I speak,
I speak forJimmy.
E.g., from now on, you start showing me
the proper fucking respect.
E.g. means ''for example.''
I thinkyou want to say ''i.e.''
-Bullshit. It's short for ''ergo.''
-Askyour man.
To the best of my knowledge,
e.g. means ''for example.''
E.g., i.e., fuckyou!
The point is: When I say, ''Jump...''
you say, ''Okay!''
Okay?
-Yeah. Okay.
-All right.
You owe me the dry cleaner's 1 5 G's
plus thejuice...
which is another...
Get it from his wife or out of
your own pocket. I don't give a fuck.
But you never hand me a book
with a miss.
We'll see you, Ray.
Go see the dry cleaner's wife.
You got three days.
I told you not to piss him off.
Don't say another fucking word.
All right?
I hate the dry cleaning business.
I hate being inside all day
around all those machines.
Must be hot.
You have no idea how hot it is.
You know, Fay, I was wondering...
did Leo have life insurance?
I don't know ofany.
I trust you, Chili.
I thinkyou're a decent type of man.
Even ifyou are a crook.
Thankyou. Thankyou, Fay.
I wish he really was dead.
He's a son ofa bitch.
That's him, all right.
Called himself ''Larry De Mille.''
Hit on every showgirl in town.
Tell them he was the ''Martinizing King''
of Miami. What a moron!
He's in L.A.
Put him on a plane.
He spanked one of my cocktail girls.
Leo spanked her?
Apparently...
he invites her to the track
to play the ponies with him.
She tells him what he can do with that.
He gives her one on the tush.
My guess, he's by his lonesome
at the track right now.
Ifyou go to L.A.,
this guy owes us 1 50 grand.
Sixty days over.
Some movie producer.
Movie producer?
Really?
-Why not?
-Appreciate that, man.
You're gonna love this guy.
Another fucking moron.
Harry Zimm.
Thanks a bunch.
-Where is it?
-It's right there.
-What is that?
-It's an Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I ordered a Cadillac.
That's the Cadillac of minivans.
Are you kidding me?
Ifyou want, La Tijera Car Rental
is right over there...
but I think all they got
is Rabbit convertibles.
I guess I'll take
the Cadillac of minivans.
Harry.
Goddamn it, wake up.
Somebody's downstairs.
What's wrong?
Somebody's downstairs.
Be quiet.
Listen.
I don't hear anything.
Right there.
That's the television.
When I came upstairs, you stayed
downstairs to finish your drink.
I told you to turn off
the television when you were through.
I also told you
you could sleep in the maid's room.
I did that. I turned the television off
with the remote thing...
then I laid it on the floor.
You know what could've happened?
The dog came in, stepped on it
and turned the TV back on.
I don't have a dog, Harry.
You don't?
What happened to Muffy?
Are you going down there,
or do I go?
I'm going.
Hurry!
Anybody skimming the pool?
It needs it.
I'm going, I'm going.
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'm going.
Areyou on
the information superhighway?
No, notyet.
Where llive, with allthepremium
services, lget2,800 channels.
-2,800.
-No kidding.
Harry Zimm.
Jesus Christ!
How you doing?
I'm Chili Palmer.
Oh,Jesus. If I have a heart attack,
I hope you know what to do.
Where you been, Harry?
Have we met?
I don't recall.
Wejust did.
I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You're in pictures, right?
Did you think what would happen
if I had a heart attack?
Look at me, Harry.
I am.
Keep looking at me.
Right here.
That's what I'm doing.
You know Dick Allen?
Mesa's Casino?
That's what this is. You're a collector
for the fucking casino.
You come in here
in the middle ofthe night...
I thought you were an actor
auditioning, for chrissakes.
We'll see about this.
Operator,
let me have Las Vegas--
Harry, let me
give you some advice.
Don't act like a hard-on.
You're standing in your undies.
You want to sit
and talk to me.
Harry, a marker is like a check.
I know what a marker is.
They don't want yours to bounce.
That annoys them.
Your dear friend,
Dick Allen...
left messages on your machine,
and you haven't called back.
So he asked me to lookyou up.
So I follow you here,
and I see you in a window with a woman.
Looks like Karen Flores,
the actress from ''Grotesque.''
You're not looking at me, Harry.
-Why must I look at you?
-Because I want you to.
You're going to get rough?
I make good by tomorrow,
oryou'll break my legs?
Come on, Harry.
Mesa's?
You tell Dick Allen...
I'll cover those markers
in the next 60 days.
If he doesn't like it,
that's his problem. The fucking prick.
So you want me to call you a cab?
You make movies?
I produce
feature motion pictures. No TV.
You mentioned ''Grotesque'' before?
That happens to be ''Grotesque, Part II''
that Karen Flores was in.
She also starred in three
of my ''Slime Creatures'' releases.
You may have seen them.
I got an idea for a movie.
Leo, he would wear...
plaid wool hats in Miami
in the middle ofsummer.
He doesn't want anyone
to think he's bald.
Say hello to Chili Palmer.
Chili, this is Karen Flores.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
How'd you get in the house?
Hejust told me an idea for a movie.
It's not bad so far.
Sit down, have a drink. Tell Karen.
See what she thinks.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I came in the back door.
-You broke in.
-It was open. Wasn't locked.
-What if it were?
-Want to hear the idea?
It's about a dry cleaner that scams
the airline out of 300 grand.
Tell her.
Well, it's simple.
Basically, it's about a guy
who owes a shylock $1 5,000...
and he's three weeks over
on the vig.
The interest you have to pay.
I know.
Anyway, this dry cleaner--
Let's call him Leo.
He's scared. He doesn't know
any better. He leaves town.
So Leogets on aplane,
but theplanesits there. Doesn 't move.
Theyannounce there'ssome kind
ofmechanicalproblem.
They'llbe there maybe an hour...
but keepyourseats,
in case they fix itsooner.
Theguy's in no shape
to sit there, sweat it out.
So he gets offthe plane.
Hegoes to the cocktaillounge
andstarts throwing them down.
ln fact, he'sstillin the lounge
when theplane crashes on takeoff.
When theguy finds out it was
his flight, he can't believe it.
If he had stayed on the plane,
he'd be dead.
He knows his luck has changed.
Ifeverybody thinks he's dead, he won't
have to pay back the 1 5 or the vig.
Keep going.
Come on.
Since Leo's name was
on the passenger list...
they bring his wife
out to the airport.
They'regoing throughpersonaleffects,
whatever wasn 't burnedup.
Leo'sbags were on theplane.
The wife tells them what to lookfor--
things that onlyshe would
knowabout.
My Leo!
A couple daysgo by.
The airlinepeople visit his wife.
Theytellherthey'resorrytheirplane
explodedandofferhera settlement.
The amount basedon what he would
have earnedforthe rest ofhis life.
How much is she offered?
Money in their hand, babe.
He gets his wife
to cash the check...
andhe takes offfor Vegas
with the dough.
Hegets there.
He'ssupposedto callher...
to let herknow
when to come out.
She neverhears from him again,
but he'shot.
He runs the300grand
up to halfa million.
-He comes to L.A.--
-But he's going nuts...
because he's winning,
and he can't say who he is.
So we show in a back story
his motivation, his desire to be famous.
He's got the dough
to buy his way in...
mix with the celebs,
and he can't resist...
so he comes to L.A.
I don't know about the mixing
with the celebrities.
That was something new
that wasjust added.
But, yeah,
he comes to L.A. and...
I don't know
what happens after that.
What? That's it?
That's your movie?
I said that I had
an idea for a movie.
That's halfa movie
with holes in it.
There's maybe 40 minutes
ofscreen time.
You don't have a girl,
a female lead.
On top ofthat, you don't have
anybody to sympathize with.
-You don't have a good guy.
-The shylock is a good guy.
The shylock is barely mentioned...
and it's not believable the wife
would get a settlement that fast.
Harry doesn't realize
it's a true story.
That Miami flight that went down?
It was on the news every day for a week.
Harry must've been busy.
-That's where you got the idea?
-Part of it, yeah.
Wait a minute. You're not the guy?
The dry cleaner?
Leo.
You wouldn't be talking to me
ifyou were.
-No, I'm not the guy, Harry.
-But you work for the casino?
For God's sake, Harry,
he's the shylock.
That's what you do for a living?
That's what I did until recently.
After I'm done here,
I don't know what I'll do next.
I got an early call.
No problemo, babe.
Go on up to bed.
I'm saying that I would like you
and your new buddy out of my house.
Oh, yeah.
Well, sure.
It was absolutely a pleasure
to meet you, Karen.
I guess in your line ofwork
there's times you have to get rough.
You know, in case
one ofyour customers don't pay?
They always pay.
You pack a gun?
Not really.
You ever been arrested?
I've been picked up for loan-sharking
and racketeering but never convicted.
No, I'm clean, Harry.
Racketeering.
That covers a lot of ground,
doesn't it?
Get to the point.
You want me to do something foryou.
That's us.
Good girl.
Don't say nothing.
Sit down and act like
you're waiting for somebody to meet you.
What the fuckyou talking about?
Ain't nobody know me here.
-Give me the fucking money.
-Sit down.
Now, be looking.
Man over to your right
in the blue wool shirt. The other way.
Derecho.
That's a federal officer.
Most likely DEA.
He moves his leg,
you look for the bulge. Sawy bulge?
Good.
That's his backup piece.
Try it without looking
right at him. Ifyou can.
-What's your name?
-Yayo Portillo.
All right. You know he's there.
Forget about him.
I'm gonna get up. Once I'm gone,
sit in the seat I'm in.
You feel something underyour ass.
That's a key...
to a locker
where your half million is...
along with some product
we're returning.
Powder's been stepped on
so many times, it's baby food.
You're supposed to give me
the money yourself!
Try to be cool, Yahoo.
I told you where it is.
Do it how I told you,
and have a safe trip home.
What'd you have for breakfast?
How come you weigh so much?
Did you have a burrito?
Give it to the nice lady.
There you go.
Say thankyou.
Thankyou.
Like fucking clockwork, huh, Bear?
Hi, Bo!
Hey, Farrah.
You ready to go for a ride, sweetie?
Told you to watch your mouth
around my daughter.
These guys, my investors,
they run a limo service.
They put some money
in a few of my pictures.
Did okay.
They're happy.
This was a few months ago
when I was planning my next picture...
about this band of killer circus freaks
leaving bodies in their wake.
There's a 700-pound fat lady who has
a way ofseducing guys in her trailer.
Harry, look at me.
You're trying to tell me you fucked up
without sounding stupid...
and that's hard to do.
Let's talk
about where you're at, okay?
You blew 200 grand
ofthese limo guys' money...
on a football game in Vegas,
and you didn't tell them. Why?
They don't seem like they'd take it
with any understanding.
They'd break my legs.
You got that on the brain.
Ifyou were so scared, why go to Vegas?
I needed a half-million dollars
to buy a script.
A movie script?
Blockbuster but quality.
No mutants or maniacs.
This is going to be
my ''Driving Miss Daisy.''
Murray Saffrin, the guy who wrote it,
did all my ''Grotesque'' pictures.
Had it in his drawer
for 20 years.
He shows it to me. Says he's got
a major star interested.
-Would I produce it?
-Which star?
Two-time Academy Award nominee,
Martin Weir.
That's Martin Weir.
He played the mob guy
turned snitch in ''Cyclone.''
One of his best parts.
His best was when he played the crippled
gay guy that climbed Mount Whitney.
''Ride the Clouds.''
Good picture.
-That woman. She looks familiar.
-She's a rock star.
Every day, same time,
they have breakfast.
He faces west,
so he can see his billboard.
She faces east
as an excuse to wear her shades.
Unbelievable.
Anyway,
Murray has this shrink...
who happens to be
Martin's personal trainer's shrink.
Murray gives the shrink the script.
The shrink gives it to the trainer,
who reads it to Martin.
-Martin loves it. He flips.
-What's the problem?
The problem is Murray.
Heart attack.
Doris, Murray's widow...
finds out about the Martin Weir thing,
and as Murray and I had no contract...
she wants halfa million
for the script.
So you want me to put you
with my dry cleaner...
so he can invest in your movie?
That, or what if
some tragic accident...
were to befall the Widow Saffrin?
I'm not going to pop her, okay?
It wasjust a thought.
I'll meet with these limo guys-- tell
them to leave you alone for a while.
Make the point so they understand.
You don't know these guys.
Believe me, Harry.
I know them better than you do.
I once asked a literary agent
what kind ofwriting paid best.
He said, ''Ransom notes.''
Ransom notes.
Here it is,
''Mr. Lovejoy.''
''Lovejoy sits behind the wheel watching
a bar, getting his video camera--''
Is he following someone?
Read it.
It's a grabber.
I thinkyour investors are here.
Oh,Jesus.
All right, this is the plan.
I want the limo guys to sit
in the chairs. Got that?
Keep the blinds open.
I want the light in their eyes.
I'll sit at the desk.
Don't introduce me.
Just start talking,
and stand behind them as they sit.
You understand?
They'll be looking at you,
but they don't know who you are.
They'll be saying,
''Who is this guy?''
But don't say anything.
Do not tell them who I am.
-I gotta say something.
-No, you don't.
Don't say more than you have to.
Unless it's like...
''Glad you assholes stopped by.
Now I can straighten you out.''
You're kidding, right?
Just say the movie's been
postponed a year but not why.
Whateveryou do, don't mention
''Mr. Lovejoy.'' Got that?
Let's go.
-Hey, Ronnie.
-Hey, Harry. Hi.
-Bo.
-Wow! What year is it?
Did we enter a time warp? I feel
like I'm in Hollywood ofyesteryear.
Have a seat.
This is my associate, Chili Palmer.
He'll be working with me.
So there's no misunderstanding...
in spite ofthe rumors
you might have heard...
your investment in ''Freaks''
is solid as the day you signed...
your participation agreement.
I can hearyou, man,
but where are you?
Right here.
What I've been wondering is,
''Where's he been?''
Where you been?
We haven't heard from you lately.
New York. I was interviewing actors,
scouting locations.
Main thing is ''Freaks'' is going
to be delayed a couple months.
-A couple months?
-Yeah.
Just a couple months.
We need more...
prep.
Bullshit, man!
We have an agreement with you.
We are going to do this picture.
I just have
another project to do first.
One I promised this guy foryears.
I want to see your books.
Show me a two
with five zeros after it.
In black and white.
I want to see your books.
I want to see
your fucking bank statements.
Hey, Ronnie.
Look at me.
You have a piece ofa movie,
not a piece of Harry.
If he wants to do another movie
this year, that's how it's gonna be.
Excuse me, bro',
but who the fuck are you?
I'm telling you how it is.
What is this other movie
you're doing for us?
-Let me show you.
-Let me answer this one.
Who am I talking to?
Him oryou?
You can talk to me.
That's what I thought.
Let me put it this way.
Outside of ''Freaks,'' it's none
ofyour business what we do.
Here it is right here.
This is the project. ''Mr. Lovejoy.''
I don't want you to think
I'm putting something over on you.
''Mr. Loveboy.''
What is it, a porno flick?
It's fluff.
You wouldn't be interested in it.
You think we see your movies?
I've seen better film on teeth.
It makes no difference to me
which one our money's in.
Take our 20 points
out of ''Freaks''...
and put them in this
''Mr. Loverboy.''
No, I can't do that.
You're positive?
It's a different kind ofdeal.
It's structured.
Okay. Then be good enough
to hand us our money back...
oryou think about us coming in
on this new deal. Let us know.
By Friday,
oryou're fucking dead as disco.
You hear me?
Take your time, Harry.
We're not animals.
Are we, Ronnie?
What?
What!
Maybe I wasn't clear, but I thought
I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I had to tell them something.
Never say anything
unless you have to.
You asked me to get these guys
offyour back.
Next thing I know, you're saying,
''Have a piece of'Mr. Lovejoy.'''
I couldn't believe my ears.
I told them I'd think about it.
In this town, what does that mean?
Nothing.
That's the difference
between you and me, Harry.
I say what I mean. If I want something
from someone, I ask them.
If I want Martin Weir,
I go get Martin Weir.
I don't fuck around
with his trainer's shrink.
Shrink's trainer.
Take me back to my car.
- Tommo? Chili.
- Whereyou been?
lbeen calling
alloverforyou.
RayBones is looking foryou.
Where the hellareyou?
-I'm in L.A. now.
-What are you doing out there?
Going into the movie business.
I'm thinking about producing.
What the fuck do you know
about making movies?
I don't think
the producer has to know much.
lthinkyou're fullofshit.
I gotta go.
Callme whenyou knowmore
about RayBones.
-Hey, Chili--
-Karen, how you doing?
What are you doing here?
I wanted to apologize
for breaking in last night.
Let me get this straight.
You broke in again to apologize
for breaking in before?
Your patio door was open.
You shouldn't do that.
You got nice things in here.
Make sure you lock it
on the way out.
Bad day?
I spent all day
crawling out ofa grave.
The director said
I was incapable of reaching...
the emotional core
ofthe character.
What? Obviously he didn't
see you in ''Bride ofthe Mutant.''
You saw that?
When you turn to the camera...
and say to the alien mother
that her time on Earth is finished...
Joan Crawford, on her best day,
wished that she had had...
in her day, the intensity you
had in that scene.
That was a good scene.
I mean, for a horror movie.
For any movie.
I'm better than
what I've been doing...
wearing fuck-me pumps and a tank top,
waiting 'til it was time to scream.
But what a scream.
It's a real gift.
All I'm saying is it'd be nice to get
the chance to say one great line.
Like in that great Bette Davis movie,
''Cabin in the Cotton''...
where she walks up to the guy,
gives him a look...
and says, ''I'd kiss you,
but I just washed my hair.''
Great line.
How come you don't do movies
with Harry anymore?
Because I married the great Martin Weir.
He was a full-timejob.
Have you read Harry's new script?
He says it's the best thing
he's ever read.
He must mean
after ''Slime Creatures III.''
Was that why Harry
came over last night?
To askyou to help him
put Martin in a movie?
Harry's dreaming ofa $40 million
production...
he'll never get offthe ground...
with a star he'll never sign,
with or without my help.
He said Martin flipped over it.
Martin's known for his flipping.
He flips over a script,
then before the deal, he flips out.
Why don't I go to Harry's office
and get a copy ofthe script?
Read it yourself.
See what you think.
Don't go out ofyour way.
No, it's nothing.
I better go talk to Leo,
my runaway dry cleaner.
Right.
See how your story ends.
That movie, ''Touch of Evil,''
is playing near my hotel.
We could check it out ifyou want.
Watch Charlton Heston be a Mexican.
That's all right.
Another time.
See you around.
See you.
My name is Ray.
I'm a friend of Chili Palmer's.
Have you spoken with Mr. Palmer
since your husband blew up?
Once or twice.
What was it you talked about?
Nothing, really.
This and that.
This and that?
I really want us to be friends.
And we know that friends don't
hit each other unless they have to.
Let's start all over again...
and you tell me
exactly what the fuck is going on.
Okay?
Good evening, sir.
And a very good evening
to you, too, sir.
Thankyou.
Leo.
Look at me.
I never thought
you'd be so dumb.
Leaving over 300 grand
in the closet under a blanket.
But I guess you are.
I didn't know
where else to keep it.
Where would you?
How about a bank?
They'd report it to the IRS.
Don't open an account.
Put in it a safe-deposit box.
You dip in it
wheneveryou want.
How'd you know I was here?
Here's another tip.
Next time you write your wife,
don't use hotel stationery.
Fay told you about the money?
She tell you my whole life story?
I'm here to save your ass.
How? By taking my money?
The money you won today
is yours.
It's all mine!
Leo, sit down.
I don't know how you got this far.
You're so fucking dumb.
You're through.
I'm gonna explain why.
I hope you're not so dumb
that you won't understand.
Ray Bones is the man
you're dealing with now.
When he finds out what you did,
he'll take everything...
including the sporty little hat
you got on your head.
Most likely he'll shoot you,
so you won't tell on him.
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
You've got $31 0,000
in the bag here.
I'll take the 300 you scammed from
the airlines, and the 1 0 leftover...
I'll borrow from you
and pay back at another time.
Wait.
You take all my money,
but you're borrowing part of it?
At 1 8%. Now, don't ask another
fucking question. I'm leaving now.
You won't know where I am!
I don't even know where I'll be!
I'll find you, Leo. You leave
a trail like a fucking caterpillar.
Wait a minute.
What's this 1 8%-a-year shit?
You want to borrow 1 0,
the vig is 3 bills a week.
That's 1 5 for the vig plus the 1 0.
That's 25 big ones!
You go the whole year, buddy!
You hear me!
This is good.
This ''Mr. Lovejoy.''
It needs a better ending, but yes,
I can see why Harry wants to do it.
You understand. I knew Harry was lying,
saying this wasn't any good...
but holding on to it like you'd have
to break his fingers to get it from him.
That's funny.
I was thinking what I'll have
to break to get it away from you.
I'm explaining to you what
I'm doing here in case you thought...
I came to rip offany ofthis
dusty old shit that the man has.
I wouldn't make you out to be a burglar.
Not in that outfit.
Harry called you his associate.
What does that mean?
I never heard your name or read it in
the ''Hollywood Reporter'' or ''Variety.''
What he said.
I'm his associate.
You must bring
something heavy to the deal.
I do. Me.
It says here you're getting
Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy?
That's right. Martin.
Come on.
How you gonna do that?
I'm gonna put a gun
to his head and say...
''Sign the fucking papers, Martin,
oryou're dead.''
That's it.
I wonder, would that work?
You know who I see
for the part ofAl Roxy?
Harvey Keitel.
Man could play it in his sleep.
He was pretty good
in the movie ''Fingers.''
Missed it.
You know who else?
Morgan Freeman. You know his work?
Morgan Freeman, yeah.
But he's a colored guy.
So what?
Where's it say in the script
the man's got to be white?
Color's what the part needs, man.
Somebody to do it with some style.
What do you think ofthe script?
First thing that's got
to go is the title.
The writer's name, Murray Saffrin,
would be better than Lovejoy.
I'm with you on that one.
You know what I'm thinking?
Why don't you and I
rewrite the script where it needs it?
You could write one?
There's nothing to it.
All you do, you get an idea.
Set down what you want to say on paper.
Then you hire someone else
to fill in the commas and shit...
where they belong,
ifyou're not positive yourself.
Maybe fix up the spelling
where you have some tricky words.
Although I've seen some scripts
I know the words weren't spelled right.
There were hardly any commas at all,
so I don't think that's too important.
You get to the end.
You write in, ''Fade out.'' You're done.
That's it?
That's all there is?
Then what the fuck
do I need you for?
Because I'm offering
my services on this one.
Tell you what.
If I need a ride sometime...
I'll let you know.
Howcouldyou arrest me here?
This is mycountry.
This is whereyou'regoing to die.
That wasno misfire!
That was to turnyou around...
'cause ldon't want
to shootyou in the back...
unlessyou'drather
tryto run from me.
ls she there?
Didyou bring my wife?
She's in the car.
They'vegot it allon tape.
- Yousureyougot enough?
-Play it back. You'llsee.
Howmany didyou frame?
- You bettergive me thatgun.
-Okay, here it is.
That's the second bullet
I've stopped foryou.
That's thesecondbullet
l'vestoppedforyou.
You're going down, Orson.
lsn 'tsomebodygoing to come
andtake him away?
ln a fewminutes.
You really likedhim, didn 'tyou?
The cop did.
The cop did.
The one who killedhim.
-He loved him.
-He lovedhim.
He wasagreat detective.
-But a lousy cop.
-Anda lousycop.
ls that allyou have
to say forhim?
He wassome kindofa man.
What does it matter
whatyousayaboutpeople?
-Good-bye, Tanya.
-Adios.
Adios.
You've been here the whole time?
I just caught the end.
Welles didn't even want
to do this movie.
He had some studio contract
he couldn't get out of.
Sometimes you do your best work
when you got a gun to your head.
I brought the script.
Harry left a copy at my house.
-How'd you like it?
-It's not horrible.
I don't like the title,
and I don't like some characters.
-So you read it?
-Not yet, but I will.
-You and Harry make a great team.
-Is that right?
-I'll make a deal with him.
-You found a role you like?
I don't want to act in it.
I want to produce it.
-Especially if I help get Martin.
-That's fair.
Yeah.
So, what do you get out of it?
Is that why you came?
To ask me that?
I want to know.
Why would anyone want
to be in the movies?
Yesterday you were a loan shark.
Yeah, but I was never
that into it.
Especially this bullshit
about having respect.
It's bad enough treating these guys
like they're your heroes.
Smiling at stupid comments
they think are so funny.
You think the movie business
is any different?
Yeah, but I like movies.
If I help Harry,
I'll find out what to do...
outside of raising money
and having an idea.
That doesn't sound so hard.
I was in the money business, and I have
a lot of ideas floating in my head.
Listen, I'm going to talk
to Martin tomorrow morning.
I told Harry I'd meet you and him
at the Abiquiu restaurant afterwards.
Thisjust might work out.
You never know.
Itjust might.
Adios.
I spent eight hours at the airport
looking at people's bulges.
I don't like that.
This is not the way
we do business.
You do not know
who you are messing with.
I don't want no fucking key.
I want the money.
Yayo! You gonna smoke,
get the hell off my $70-a-yard carpet.
I told you where the money is.
All you got to do is go and get it.
No!
Now I tell you something.
I go to the airport,
open that locker and they bust me?
I tell them I come to get something
foryou. That's all I know.
-That's all you know?
-That's all I know.
Wait here a minute, Yayo.
I'll be back directly.
Keep an eye on Yahoo for me.
That's how you get things done.
What the fuck
you gonna do with that?
I'm taking you out, Yahoo.
Did you see that?
The way the man just went right over?
Maybe we could get
Chili Palmer up here?
You could fix my railing
to give way like in the movies.
I invite the man up here
to look at my view.
Get him to lean
over the railing...
Dumbest idea I ever heard.
Here's the thing, Bear.
I want to produce movies.
What's the point of living in L.A.
unless you're in the movie business?
And I mean high up in it.
That's why Harry's going
to produce ''Mr. Lovejoy'' with me...
not Chili Palmer.
I can't believe
this map is accurate.
I bought it for ten bucks
from a kid on Sunset.
You were supposed to meet me
at the restaurant.
I know, but look. ''Martin Weir's house
across from George Hamilton.''
-That must be Geo--
-Chili?
Nicole?
Jesus, it is you.
It's Nicki now.
I don't believe this.
This is great.
I know her.
-Hi, Nicki.
-Karen.
Shit, I didn't see you there.
How are you?
Come in, baby. You gotta come in.
You gotta meet Martin.
Where've you been?
What've you been doing?
Chili was the only one at Momo's
didn't try to hit on me.
What a gentleman.
Do you like my hair?
Black...
Nice, yeah.
Especially under the arms.
Martin won't let me shave.
Guess I fill some need.
Takes him back to the sixties
or something.
Speak ofthe devil.
Karen, look at you.
You smell so good.
She always smells so good.
Neat.
Martin, this is Chili Palmer.
-Chili, is it?
-Nice to meet you, Martin.
Chili's a gangster.
Ran a club I used to play at
for another gangster back in Miami.
-How is Momo these days?
-Dead.
Bummer.
Well, I'll let you get
to your movie talk.
Chili, do not leave
without saying good-bye to me.
See you.
So...
You know how beautiful you are?
You really are beautiful.
I'm sitting here...
I'm looking at you,
having memories of us.
-Really?
-Yeah.
I'm wondering, how did it go wrong?
How did it all slip away?
It didn't slip away. You did, by going
offto fuck Nicki at my birthday party.
Yeah. That was a good party.
Marty, you were so good
in ''The Cyclone.''
Martin.
That was a beautiful role.
All I had to do was find
the character's center...
the stem I used to wind him up,
and he'd play.
-He'd just play.
-You had that down cold.
If I didn't know better,
I'd have thought you was a made guy.
-Thankyou.
-I mean, no acting there.
And the fink part.
Oh, man.Jesus Christ!
I never met a fink,
and I hope I never do...
but the way you played a fink,
that's how it's gotta be, right?
Yeah.
Two weeks
before we started shooting...
I went back to Bensonhurst
just to hearyou guys talk.
I'm Italian,
but I grew up in Tarzana.
I wanted to get the rhythms
ofyour speech, you know?
We speak differently?
It's more your attitude.
Your tone.
Your speech patterns show a certain
confidence in yourselves...
in your opinions, your indifference
to conventional views.
It's like--
We don't give a shit.
Kind of, yeah.
Anyway, once I get
the authentic sounds ofspeech...
the rhythms,
the patois, you know...
I can actually get into their heads
and think the way those guys do.
-Really?
-Yeah.
I'm one ofthose guys.
What am I thinking?
Don't get me wrong.
An actual metamorphosis doesn't
take place. That wouldn't be acting.
-So you don't know what I'm thinking?
-No, but I'm curious.
You want to know
what I'm thinking?
-Yeah, ifyou want to tell me.
-I'm thinking about a movie.
One of mine?
No, one that we're producing.
With what?
Wise guy money?
Maybe this wasn't a good idea.
No, no.
I'm not connected to that anymore.
Not since I left
loan-sharking in Miami.
The pressure got too much?
Pressure? I'm the one
who applied the pressure.
Oh, yeah?
-Can I ask a question?
-Yeah.
You're an actor.
Actors like to pretend.
We've been known to make believe.
Pretend this.
You're a shylock.
A guy owes you 1 5 grand,
and he skips town.
He takes off.
What do you do?
Oh, Martin,
for chrissake.
Just...
you know.
I'm doing Shylock,
instead ofa shylock.
-Right.
-What's my motivation?
The acquisition of money.
To collect.
To inflict pain if I have to.
Guy splits with 1 5 large
of my money?
I'd go after him!
What the hell you think I'd do?
-Look at me.
-I am looking at you.
No, look at me
the way I'm looking at you.
Put it in your eyes.
''You're mine, asshole.''
Without saying it.
How about this?
What are you telling me?
That you're sleepy?
That you want to go to bed?
Wait, wait.
Now you're squinting,
like you need glasses.
What do you--
-Look at me.
-What?
What I'm thinking is,
''You're mine.''
''I fucking own you.''
What I'm not doing is feeling
one way or another about it.
You see,
you're not a person to me.
You're an entry in my book.
A guy who owes me money.
All right.
How about this?
Not bad.
Not bad.
-No wonderyou're Martin Weir.
-Oh, yeah.
That's what I think ofyou, asshole.
Nothing.
I believe it.
I believe it.
I turn this on
when I confront the guy?
You haven't found him yet
because he split for Las Vegas.
-How do I know that?
-His wife told you.
His wife told me.
Okay.
Harry, how you doing?
Oh, hi.
Great.
I'm expecting some people.
You must be doing some big deals,
doing lunch in a place like this.
I'm working on a few things.
I hearyou bagged
Martin Weir for ''Mr. Lovejoy.''
This town.
Word gets around, doesn't it?
Chili Palmer told me.
Last night, when he called me
over to your office to talk about it.
Chili Palmer
showed you my script?
Yeah.
I was wondering why he'd do that.
So the wife sues the airline.
This is some gutsy babe.
Good-looking too.
Like Karen.
When do I meet up with the husband
and give him the look?
That's not so simple.
There's a mob guy. Real hard-on.
You owe him money.
He wants to take you out
because you broke his nose and shot him.
Right, right.
Go ahead. Keep going.
At this point,
basically that's got to be it.
That's all you'll tell me?
Actually, Martin,
the reason we came by...
was to talk about ''Mr. Lovejoy.''
We understand you read the script.
You loved it. You flipped.
Refresh my memory.
Listen, Harry. How'd you like
to get your hands on $500,000?
You pay me back at your convenience
with no interest.
Are you serious?
All I want in return is to work
on this movie with you.
I've already got some strong ideas
on how to fix it up.
Gentlemen,
can I get you anything else?
Let's get another for Mr. Zimm.
A double.
You'rejust going to give me
We'll talk about that,
but first I gotta know...
how'd you hook up
with Chili Palmer?
''Mr. Lovejoy'' was good.
I'll call Buddy and set up a meeting.
-Who's Buddy?
-Lufkin, his agent.
-Karen knows him.
-But you are interested?
I'm intrigued.
You know what might help?
Another look at ''The Cyclone.''
The way a visual fabric
is maintained...
while the metaphor plays
on different levels.
Hey, Chili,
is this your ride?
I like to sit up high.
Check everything out.
It is the Cadillac of minivans.
Check this out.
Mind if I take it for a spin?
He was watching Letterman?
Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.
Did he find the dry cleaner,
the one with all that money?
Leo?
I don't know.
I bet he did, but he ain't giving
one penny of it to help you out.
Not the way I am.
Assuming I go along with this,
when could I have the 500 grand?
Wheneveryou want.
The money's in a jock bag
in $1 00 bills out at the airport...
just waiting in a locker
to be picked up.
At the airport?
It was waiting on a deal
that didn't go through.
You don't want to know.
I don't know...
It's not the kind ofthing you do,
so I'm thinking.
Why not send your boy,
Chili Palmer?
If he gets busted, hit on the head,
you aren't out a thing.
C-1 8.
Magic number.
I'm positive.
It was Susan Hayward.
No, it was Rita Hayworth
and Glenn Ford.
Excuse me, Harry.
Wait here.
I'd like you to meet
my associate, Bear.
Movie stuntman, champion weight lifter,
as you may have noticed.
Throws things out
I don't want.
You ought to turn around
and go back to Miami.
You're a stuntman?
-Any good?
-Am I good?
That's not bad
for a guy his size.
I'll make you a deal.
Ifyou can get out of here
before I take my coat off...
I won't clean up the floor with you
and mess up your pretty costume.
You don't know me.
You only thinkyou do.
That guy is a stuntman.
Yeah, he was in ''Creatures II.''
Rough business
this movie business.
I may have to go back
to loan-sharking to take a rest.
What're you still doing
with those guys?
He happens to be loaning me $500,000.
No strings.
I can write any kind
ofagreement I want.
-Cash or check?
-Cash.
It happens to be sitting at the airport
in a locker at this moment.
A locker at the airport.Jesus Christ,
tell me you're not really that stupid.
You're being set up.
You cancelled that ''Freaks'' deal.
He's paying you back.
Is that right?
He's setting me up?
Why did Catlett say I should send you
to the airport to pick it up?
You haven't done a thing for me
since you got involved...
except show Bo Catlett my script.
You're right.
You're not the one being set up.
At least Bo has invested
in three of my movies.
We spoke with Martin.
We?
-Chili and me.
-Really?
He asked us to call Buddy,
set up a meeting.
A meeting.
You and Karen?
Guy's been in town two days...
and already he thinks
he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Okay, Mr. O. Selznick,
should I make my deal with Bo...
or are you going to talk
to your dry cleaner, ifyou find him?
I found him,
but forget about Leo's money.
Do you have it?
If I gave you Leo's money,
you'd have Ray Bones all overyour ass.
-That's a new kind oftrouble.
-Who?
Ray Barboni. He lives in Miami.
He owns Leo now that Momo's dead.
Who the fuck is Momo?
Where do you get these names?
I tell you what I'll do foryou.
I'll go to the airport
tomorrow morning when it's crowded.
I'll check it out. Ifthere's
no problem, I'll get the money.
But don't get your hopes up.
Maybe I should call
this Ray Barboni character...
and see if he wants
to invest in my movie?
Don't waste your time.
He's not a movie fan.
Give me the key.
Tell him he's gotta be out there
by 5:00 in the morning.
Because the actor will
only work one night, that's why.
I gotta go.
Coming!
-Who is it?
-Me.
Oh, fuck.
I heard that.
Hello, Doris.
Harry Zimm.
You look like a wet kiss.
Aren't you going to offer me
whatever it is you taste like?
Come in, Doris.
My favorite color...
putty.
I like it.
What do you want?
I miss Murray.
Yeah, I miss him too.
A hell ofa good writer.
I should know. I discovered him,
made him what he was.
What he was was a hack.
He couldn't get a job writing
for anyone but you.
I'm being honest.
He was a lousy writer
but a good husband.
I just didn't know
until it was too late.
You know what they say.
I hate being alone.
The house is so quiet.
So lonely.
It needs...
a man's touch.
Nice necklace, Doris.
I don't know
how I feel about this.
You seem to feel fine about it.
I mean morally.
You know, Murray was a friend.
Murray's dead.
Does this mean that...
you'll reconsider our deal
on ''Mr. Lovejoy''?
No, but now that
you mention it...
I did talk to a gorgeous
young executive at Paramount...
whojust happened
to get his hands on the script.
What'd he say?
If Martin's interested,
I can get halfa million for it, easy.
Don't worry, Harry.
I'm still giving you until Friday.
How honorable ofyou.
You want me to go?
Just say so.
What the hell.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
What?
Ray Barboni?
Who is this?
ls this theguy
theycallRayBones?
It depends.
Who is this?
Who is this?
This is the one telling you
the way it is.
Okay, asshole?
You want your 300 grand, or don't you?
What 300 grand
are you talking about?
The 300 grand a guy named Leo Devoe
scammed offan airline.
The 300 grand Chili Palmer
now has in his possession.
Hello?
Are you there?
I'm here.
I just don't like this anonymous crap.
Eitheryou're a big chickenshit,
oryou're not for real.
Trust me.
I am very for real.
Then who are you?
lhappen to work forHarryZimm, okay?
Who?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be
a major Hollywood player.
Never heard of him.
Maybe because you've never been
out offucking Miami, dipshit.
Maybe you should get on a plane, come
to L.A., take a meeting with Mr. Zimm.
So this Zimm guy,
is he asking for a finder's fee?
Is that
what we're talking about?
Zimm don't ask for dick.
Zimm tells you the way it is,
or else.
Or else what?
Orelse
useyourfucking imagination!
Excuse me.
Can you help me out?
I have a gift
in here for my wife.
It's a surprise, and I was wondering
ifyou could put this in locker C-1 7.
Ten bucks.
Take you two minutes.
Yeah, okay.
You'll need some ofthis.
Make it quick.
She's in thejohn.
C-1 7.
Good man.
Let's go, boys.
Excuse me, sir.
Agent Curtis,
Drug Enforcement.
These are Agents Dunbar and Morgan.
Would you come with us, please?
What's going on?
Let's follow him
and behave ourselves.
Mr. Barbone?
Welcome to L.A.
I'm Bobby, your driver.
Did you have a good flight?
Yeah, but I hope you drive better
than you fucking spell, jack-off.
The name is Barboni
not Barbone, okay?
Want to go to the hotel first,
Mr. Escobar?
I want to get my fucking money.
-You live in Miami?
-That's right.
Why are you in Los Angeles?
-I'm in movies.
-You're an investor?
-No, I'm a producer.
-Got a card in this?
Not yet, I just got started.
I'd like to know what this is all about.
I got a search warrant
says I can strip-search you.
Pat him down.
Put your hands on the wall.
Spread your legs.
What are you doing
at the airport?
Picking up my wife,
but she wasn't on the plane.
Ifyou live in Miami,
why is your wife coming from Newark?
We had a fight. She left me.
Went back to Brooklyn.
I called her and said,
''Why don't you come out west?
Maybe a change ofscenery
will get us back together.''
She said okay,
but evidently she changed her mind.
-Wife a Lakers fan?
-I am.
I'm a fan ofeverything that's L.A.
I love it out here.
He's clean.
You can go.
What are you looking for?
A bomb?
Something that shouldn't be here.
Is that right?
Get an attendant to open the lockers.
Maybe you'll find it.
I'll think about it.
I'd do that.
Then I'd get
the right guy next time.
You ever want to go to the beach,
here's the freeway you take.
Ofcourse, on the weekend
there's no traffic.
I'm from Miami fucking Beach,
and you want to show me the ocean?
Does the sun ever shine in this town,
or is this smog always around?
They say the smog's the reason
we have such beautiful sunsets.
That's what they say?
What a bunch offucking bullshit.
I don't know how I could have
missed you in that shirt.
The same as the other one except
a different colored hibiscus, right?
You didn't have the key on you?
You think I'd be standing here?
Ifyou're gonna set someone up,
and you want it to work...
it's gotta be a surprise.
Spotted them?
Did it work in some movie
that you got beat up in?
Got to askyou for that key back.
Wait. The setup didn't work,
and you want the key back?
Bo said ifyou didn't open the locker,
the deal's off.
You're serious?
This is how you guys do business?
I'm surprised you're not dead.
There's no fucking way
you'll get the key.
Unless you put a gun to my head.
Then maybe we'll talk.
Move away
from the fucking car.
I don't need a gun foryou.
All right.
Slow down.
Breathe through your mouth.
Breathe.
Bear, look at me.
Tell your boss
I don't wanna see him again.
He made a deal with Harry,
and a deal's a deal.
Got that?
Okay, get up.
Why are you hanging around a guy
like that?
You were in the movies.
You were a stuntman, right?
What's he ever done
he can talk about?
-You okay?
-Not too bad.
How about when you fell
down the stairs?
Pulled my quadriceps.
How many movies you been in?
About 60.
-No shit?
-No shit.
What were some ofthem?
You didn't see
none ofthem.
Harry Zimm?
Who is it?
I'm the dipshit
who's never been out of Miami.
Mr. Barboni, what a nice surprise.
Good to see you.
Have a seat.
Right here.
Ray Bones.
Barboni, sorry.
They say the fucking smog
is the fucking reason...
you have
such beautiful fucking sunsets.
What do you mean
he faked them out?
He knewit wasa setup,
andhe wasready forit.
Where's the money?
lguess it'sstill
in the locker.
You guess?
You mean you don't know?
lmean ldon't care.
lreally don't care.
I'll call you later.
Mr. Escobar, what a surprise.
Welcome to L.A.
-Where's my nephew?
-Your who?
Yayo!
Where is he?
I haven't seen Yayo.
He's my sister's kid. No father.
Not too bright. I think he's a retard.
I only gave him thejob as a favor
to my sister. You understand.
Family.
I know how that goes.
He comes up here
with our product.
He's supposed to return with $500,000.
He never shows up.
Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy.
She calls all the time. She's worried.
Me? I just want to know
what happened to my fucking money.
I gave the man his money
and sent him on his way.
You gave him the money?
I gave him a key to a locker
that had the money in it.
Why would you
put the money in a locker?
There were a zillion DEA guys
hanging around the terminal.
A zillion?
That's a lot.
Mr. Escobar, maybe your nephew
panicked and took off.
Why're you talking
to me this bullshit?
I think I have Ramon and Cesar
staple your tongue to your chin!
What do you think?
I thinkyou speak
very good English, Mr. Escobar.
We're spending the weekend
at the Universal Sheraton.
Take the tour.
See the shark.
Check out that ''Miami Vice''
action spectacular.
Nice.
After, we're going
to come back here...
get my money.
And Yayo too.
His fucking nephew?
Go to the bank.
Raidthe limo account.
We got dick in the bank.
We dumped it all
into Harry's movie.
I'm talking about you,
Ray Barboni...
owning a piece
ofa major motion picture.
How much ofa piece
is entirely up to you.
I'm saying you could invest
part ofthe 300 grand...
that Palmer owes you
or all of it.
It's up to you.
Where's Chili Palmer?
Where's Leo Devoe?
Where's my fucking money?
Ray, look at me.
What?
Look at me.
Did you say look at you?
Look at me, Ray.
I'll tell you what, Harry.
Take a fucking look at this.
And have a peek at this.
You know, Harry,
this...
is the exact fucking thing
I needed.
A little fucking exercise...
after that long...
fucking...
plane ride.
You got a big problem, Harry.
Come on, Harry,
don't pass out on me.
Look at me, Harry.
Where's my money?
Where's my money?
I'll askyou one more time...
then I gotta shoot you,
you don't tell me what I want.
Where's my money?
Your money?
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Ray Barboni, from Miami.
Like that's
supposed to mean something?
The man you're standing on
belongs to me and my partner, bro'.
-This piece ofshit owes me money.
-Get in line.
I don't like waiting in line.
Tough shit. This ain't Miami.
You want something, you talk to me.
No, no, fuckyou, fuckball.
L.A. is an open city, and I don't think
I have to get permission...
from nobody for nothing.
Really?
I just closed it.
You must be one
ofthose quick-draw artists...
because you got your gun
stuck way down in your belt.
What do you got there?
A wop nine?
Fucking Fiat of guns,
alwaysjamming at the wrong time.
Don't you puke
on my shoes, Harry.
I want you to do me a favor.
I want you to take this gun...
and put a pill
in the bro' over there.
I know you're thinking, ''Why fucking
shoot him? He's already dead.''
But you see,
the police have these tests...
tell you whether or not
a guy fired a gun...
and I was never here.
Understand, Harry?
I was never here.
Ifyou say I was...
I'll come back
and throw you out the fucking window.
Knock it off, Harry.
We haven't got a lot oftime.
That's it.
That's it.
Not a worry in the world.
Your pool needs skimming.
Martin wants to have lunch tomorrow,
ifyou can make it.
Depends on who pays.
Definitely not Martin.
Movie stars never pick up the check.
They have no idea
what things cost.
Most ofthem don't know
their phone number or zip code.
I can't imagine
the two ofyou together.
You don't like Martin much,
do you?
No, I do. I do.
I think he's--
I think he's short.
I know he's a good actor, but what
was it exactly that you saw in him?
Martin was different then.
He wasn't a movie star.
Anyway, what about your story?
Thought ofa title?
How about, ''Get Shorty?''
How about,
''Chili's Hollywood Adventure?''
That's a different story.
I'm still working on that one.
I'm still getting
the visual fabric together.
But I have added to it.
There's a girl in it now.
Really?
She looks a lot like you.
I thinkyou could be an actor.
I know you're acting sometimes,
but you don't show it.
You thought I was faking?
No, not then.
I mean in general.
You don't mean a movie star, right?
You mean more like a character actor?
Well, whichever.
I could see myself in the parts
a Robert DeNiro plays.
Maybe even an Al Pacino movie.
I'm playing a real hard-on.
I can't see myself in a movie
where 3 guys get left with a baby...
and they act like 3 grown-up assholes,
like they're all cute.
Chili, look at me.
Leave a message.
Hi, Karen, it'sDoris.
You might want to come by Cedars
tonight and visit Harry.
He's in the emergency room.
Let's go.
I stopped by his office...
to see if he wanted to take me
to Le Dome for dinner.
I saw Harry and some other man
lying on the floor.
Good night, Todd.
Good night, Louis.
Oh, man.
-Jesus.
-Harry, my God.
He can't talk.
He's full of Demerol.
What happened?
According to Todd--
Sergeant Randall--
a man named Ronnie came by
Harry's office to collect on a debt.
He got rough,
and Harry shot him.
You shot Ronnie?
Hello, hello.
Okay, here we go.
Looks like Mr. Zimm has a broken jaw
and some neck trauma...
to go with these fractured hands.
Excuse us, folks.
Martin wanted to meet us
for lunch tomorrow at the Ivy.
I'd cancel, but he's going
to Cannes next week...
so I really think maybe
Chili and I should still go.
Who wants to take a crack
at wiring Mr. Zimm'sjaw?
Son ofa bitch.
Hi, Bo!
Hey, Farrah.
Little honey bunny.
You wipe your feet
before you came in?
That's my girl.
Keep Uncle Bo's carpet
nice and white.
I been calling you, man.
Where you been?
See the paper?
Yeah, I seen it.
I don't believe it.
Says Harry shot
Ronnie five times.
Four through the chest
and one through his foot?
His foot,Jesus.
Poor Ronnie.
Tonight, I got one foryou
that doesn't involve any heavy work.
Go take a look
around Chili's hotel room.
I can't.
I gotta take Farrah
over to her mother's in Costa Mesa...
and that don't matter,
'cause I quit.
I don't work foryou no more.
I came to tell you...
to your face,
so we got no misunderstanding.
The Colombians are in L.A.,
all upset about their money.
Ifthat ain't enough, it turns out
that Yo-Yo was Escobar's nephew.
That's your problem.
You shot the guy.
Honey bunny. Come here.
Come here, honey bunny.
Come see Uncle Bo.
You know Uncle Bo
hates being alone.
In fact he hates it so much...
he takes a fall,
he's not going to fall by himself.
He'll plea-deal his way out.
Give up his ace stuntman,
now one ofthe West's dope kings...
ifthey go easy on the cat.
I hear in federal joints they let you
spend an extra five minutes...
with your daddy on Father's Day.
Let her go.
After this one, I'm out.
You understand?
This is the last time
we talk to each other.
Remember Harry's story
about the dry cleaner Palmer was after--
the one who stole $300,000
from the airline?
What about him?
Tonight, look around Palmer's hotel room
while I check out Karen's place.
See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
Meet me back here at midnight.
What kind offood do they got
at this Ivy place?
Continental, but it doesn't matter.
Martin won't order from the menu.
Why not?
Movie stars can never order
straight from the menu.
They have to think ofsomething they
have to have that isn't on the menu.
Why're you here?
You're supposed to be in the hospital.
You look like you should be
in one ofyour horror movies.
My project!
-What did he say?
-My project.
Thattaboy, Killer!
Right this way.
You're a celebrity.
Should've shot someone a long time ago.
Excuse me.
How're you?
-Good to see you.
-Great to see you.
Oh, my goodness.
Sweet face.
You look great.
Smell good too.
I hearyou had
quite an experience.
Anyway, I'm glad you're okay.
You know what else? I'm really glad
you rejected me ten years ago...
when I auditioned for Eddie Solomon,
the pedophile clown in ''Birthday Boy.''
If I'd have gotten that part,
I might have been typecast.
Have you guys ordered?
I have something after this.
Can we order?
Excuse me, can you--
-Hi, what's your name?
-Stephanie.
Can you make me an egg white omelette
but with shallots?
Shallots only slightly browned,
very little olive oil.
And no salt.
Why don't you bring one for the table?
We'll all pick on it.
I know, how about having
those strawberry frappes?
The drink with the little strawberries.
Bring two straws for Harry.
I think the romance angle in your story
is critically important.
It shouldn't bejust a hop
in the sack for either ofthem.
They should fall deeply in love.
Which two?
Later, when their lives
are in danger...
and the mob guy is chasing them,
it not only heightens the tension...
but it adds a wistful element
to their romance.
Mob guy?
I have to consider,
as the mob guy...
it's another man's wife
I'm sleeping with.
And you have such morals.
Mob guy?
I have to run.
What I'd like to see is that...
they begin to have misgivings
about wanting the money.
This becomes a moral dilemma.
They rationalize taking it,
but in the end, they can't.
What money?
The 300 large.
What other money is there?
I know I shouldn't talk about it
until I've read the script...
but I have such a good feeling
about this.
I am that shylock.
Look at me.
Not bad.
You're getting it down.
It scares me
how well I know this guy.
I could do this tomorrow,
no further preparation.
Dollface.
You really should think
about getting back into acting.
We could do something together.
I'll give it some heavy thought.
Take care ofyourself.
Enjoy.
Here, let me help you out.
Go ahead.
Suck harder.
Wake up!
Somebody's downstairs.
It's Harry.
How do you know?
He's doing the same thing you did.
Playing ''Letterman'' on TV.
That's not Dave.
That's a movie.
-You going down?
-I don't know.
You don't know?
I don't know.
I'm going.
-Karen, you got a gun?
-No!
-Any kind of gun will do.
-No!
Sounds like ''Rio Bravo.''
Guessl'lltake
that drinknow, Charlie.
lthoughtyou would.
You want thatgun?
Pickit up.
l wishyou would.
I need the money.
What money?
The 300 grand you got
from a dry cleaner named Leo.
Let's me get this straight.
You break
into Karen Flores' house...
and you ask for 300 grand
that doesn't belong to you.
Give me the money.
I can't believe how you guys
do business out here.
I can't believe how fucked up
your organization is.
How about I count to three and organize
your brain all over the wall? One.
You're going to shoot me?
-Just a second. Two.
-I can't believe this.
She can't talk right now.
That's a nice scream.
They ought to give you more work.
All right, I'll get you the money,
but it's not here.
-I gotta go get it.
-Okay, fine.
In the meantime,
I'll hold her for safekeeping.
-Do you know Laurel Canyon?
-I'll find it.
Right off Laurel.
I'll be there, Karen.
-You get the money?
-No.
-What is this?
-Plan B.
Make yourselfcomfortable.
-She's a movie star!
-I don't care!
For chrissake.
-Going to make a trade.
-For what?
-The money.
-You get life for kidnapping.
-Calm down.
-Life in prison!
-You want me to calm down!
-Do not fade on me, Bear.
What, are you
going to shoot me now?
Go ahead!
Put me out of my misery!
Calm the hell down...
unless you want to spend the rest
ofyour life holding Farrah...
in a room
full of goddamned felons!
So!
This is one ofthem houses you see
hanging offthe side ofthe cliff.
Where's Karen?
In my bathroom.
Where's the money?
-Let me see her.
-Go ahead.
You okay?
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet!
She's great.
Give me the money.
First, I'm gonna settle something
between you and me.
Now, I've been shot at before...
once by accident,
twice on purpose...
and I'm still here.
I'm gonna be here
as long as I want.
Which means you gotta be
somewhere else.
Nowhere near me,
Karen or Harry.
Here's your money.
Take it and leave...
the movie business to the rest of us
who know what we're doing.
Come on, Karen.
You broke in my house,
and I have a witness to it.
What?
Only this time it ain't noJohn Wayne
or Dean Martin shooting bad guys...
-in ''El Dorado.''
-That was ''Rio Bravo.''
Robert Mitchum played the drunk
in ''El Dorado.''
Dean Martin played the drunk
in ''Rio Bravo.''
Basically, it was the same part.
John Wayne did the same in both.
He played John Wayne.
Man, I can't wait
foryou to be dead.
Are you going to--
That's for the stairs,
and that's for the airport.
Get him off my carpet
before he starts to bleed.
You want to take this guy out?
Come out to the deck.
Make it look like he came at us.
You shoot him.
Self-defense.
-Shouldn't he have a weapon? A knife?
-Get it later.
All right, that's enough.
You keep hitting him like that,
he won't look like he broke in.
It'll look like somebody beat him up
and then shot him.
No, he ain't.
Hold on!
We gotta get out of here!
What are you doing?
-What are you doing?
-Oh, shit.
She's shooting at us!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
How do you think
that happened?
Beats the shit out of me.
Were you scared up there?
You bet.
You don't act like it.
I was scared then, not now.
How long you want me to be scared?
I'll be right back.
How'd you get in?
It was easy.
I told them I was you.
I acted real stupid,
and they believed me.
What brings you to L.A., Bones?
Please, don't insult me.
Just turn around.
Turn around!
Do you know that you're
the dumbest fuck I've ever met?
Let me look in these pockets.
You should've told me about Leo
as soon as you found out.
Why would I do that?
Because he's a customer of mine.
Dummy. He belongs to me.
Well, well, well.
What have we here?
C-1 8.
I wonder what this could be?
A locker key?
But where's the locker?
I checked the bag at the airport.
Which terminal?
Which terminal!
Sovereign.
You found Leo.
You took the poor bastard's money.
You put it in a locker ready to go.
Why haven't you left?
I like it out here.
You know, Chili,
I've been thinking.
There's really no reason
why you and I shouldn't get along.
Forget all the stuff
that happened.
I don't even remember
how this mess started.
You took a swing at me for some
fucking thing. I say, ''Fuck it.''
I say you owe me money.
Fuck that.
I say you owe me thejuice on the money?
Fuck that too.
I say live and let die.
But this...
is strictly between you and I.
You say nothing...
to nobody about this.
Understood?
Whateveryou say.
I think it's only fair.
Then it's all settled.
I'll see you around.
Dumb fuck.
Come on.
The fucking airport.
Bingo, boys.
Let's go.
Hey, Bones,
look at me.
Fuckyou, fuckball.
Damn!
Cut! Cut!
-I'm pushing the right button.
-You're not, or it wouldn't fall.
Every take I push the right button.
Bear, man,
you show him how to do it.
I don't really know.
What do you want to do, Harry?
Wrap.
It's a wrap.
Come back tomorrow.
What're you doing? You should've gone
into overtime to get that shot.
This is only the second day.
We're already two weeks behind.
Do me a favor, okay?
I don't understand.
Martin told me that he loves it.
I just don't think
Martin is right, okay?
-Why the hell not?
-He's too short.
Come on.
Why does he keep pushing Martin?
Packaging.
You can't make a Martin Weir
into a Mel Gibson.
Where do you want to go?
Morton's or Dan Tana's?
