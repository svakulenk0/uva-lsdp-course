Iraq has
increased the level of its oil reserves
by 24 % since Saddam Hussein
was removed.
up from 115 billion barrels
estimated previously.
- Under Saddam Hussein...
- Fucking bitch!
- political isolation meant
little new exploratory work
Closer to home, with the government
way ahead in the opinion polls,
the focus of debate in
the upcoming general election today
switched from the economy
to the domestic terror threat.
The government claims
that domestic terror groups
fractured since
Osama Bin Laden's death,
and due to increased cooperation
with key Middle...
Unbelievable!
People have no idea about
the shit storm that's about to go down.
Is this thing real?
Don't play with it.
Have I lost weight?
Was gonna say you look different.
I've lost weight. I mean, I feel good.
It's 50 short.
Get her out of here.
What about my money?
Get your hands off me.
Don't touch me!
You're still fat, Harry.
- Get off!
- Bitch.
Yeah.
OK. Now.
Follow them.
Take a left here,
head to the centre of town.
I'm going in.
There's too many people.
They're gonna go upstairs, find there's
no one there and that'll be it.
No.
Give me your fucking gun.
Wait here.
Excuse me, sir.
Move!
Ah!
He never stated his destination?
He gave his driver instructions
as we went along.
He never suspected
who you worked for?
No.
The Semtex?
It was taken.
I placed a tracer in one of the blocks
the night before.
The tracer went offline
when the attack took place.
We're trying to kick-start it
remotely now.
The perpetrators knew
we were gonna be there at that time.
They knew where we were going.
And you didn't stop them?
Perhaps you don't
belong here any more.
So we've no idea to whom
the Semtex was to be delivered?
No.
You and I, Charlotte, in five.
Difficult times.
He's getting pressures from on high.
You did what you could, Ewan.
Charlotte?
Present from my ex-husband.
Get that seen to and get some rest.
On my break.
I've got two minutes left.
No, I'm not smoking.
I'm not inhaling, I'm walking.
I'm out of breath
cos I had to rush back from lunch.
Tuna sandwich.
Tuna sandwich and some crisps,
and a chocolate biscuit
and a coffee, no sugar.
Hey, we gonna go for drinks? Make it...
about quarter past, yeah?
How's Dad? And the fence?
The garden fence.
Just tell him to wait
and I'll help him the next time I'm up
because his back won't hold up.
I'll get time off. It's not a problem.
I don't know when.
I'll let you know when I know.
Hey, one minute.
It's a good job. Gives me time to drink.
Think, I said think!
About whatever. I've got my degree,
I can do what I want.
Look, I've gotta go, I'm late.
Yep, I love you too.
Sorry.
See ya.
Can I help you, sir? Table for one?
Almost there.
How did you do it?
Slipped.
Doing something strenuous?
Your girlfriend will love the scar.
Sexy.
Wife.
Come back in two days,
take the stitches out.
Might still be here.
Back in a minute with some painkillers.
Yeah.
been confirmed
that a suicide bombing
occurred earlier today
at 12:30 in the busy
South London restaurant, Driscoll's.
With currently confirmed casualties
of 20
and with more understood
to be injured.
The restaurant was full
of lunchtime customers,
an organization which had
Middle East energy interests
All are believed
to be amongst the fatalities.
The same Semtex that was
stolen was used in the bombing.
An element in Whitehall feels that
Obama's inclusive doctrine
has spread across the Atlantic
and has made us complacent.
They're pushing for sweeping changes.
If they discover that the Semtex
was being monitored by us
and that we could have stopped it...
I don't need to tell you
the repercussions for this government,
especially with the election looming.
The clock is ticking on all of us.
It's just you and I here, Charlotte.
What can you do for me?
We are here to remember
Corporal Peter Walcott Tiernan,
taken from us in the service of Queen
and country in Afghanistan.
He bravely answered his country's call,
and leaves a loving wife, Louise,
his brothers, Ian and Daniel,
and his mother, Margaret.
It's at times like these that
we must find strength and peace
in the memories
of what he meant to us,
an honorable son and brother.
He was older than his 25 years
and was the one his family relied upon
since losing their father at an early age.
He undertook his responsibilities
with dignity and strength
and maintained a strong family bond.
Remember he said
he had a trial for United?
He said he missed out
cos he was too fast.
You remember, sir?
Yeah, I remember.
Last letter I got from him, he...
He said the regiment
weren't the same since you left.
- How are you, mate?
- How do I look like I am?
Cold makes it hurt like a bastard.
I can't sleep properly.
What happened there?
Ah, some stupid accident.
- Is that your wife?
- Yeah.
Thinks I'm some sort of invalid.
She can't stop fussing.
You should be thankful.
See that bomb they set off in London?
It was on the news.
It never ends. None of it.
What was the point of Pete dying, sir?
Dying in some shithole country
for nothing.
- What was the fucking point?
- What's the matter with you?
Have some respect for him,
for his family.
You got hurt, but you're here.
You're alive.
Listen to me,
we move on.
What's here and now,
that's all that matters, all right?
Go back to your wife.
If you need help,
you can always find me.
We stick together, all of us.
Have you moved on, sir?
From what happened?
Hello?
A car will be downstairs
in 15 minutes.
I'm Mark.
Baby daughter.
Take the path through the wood.
You'll find her at the other end.
Bit of a walk.
You've seen the news.
Semtex was used. You understand?
Perpetrator?
It was strapped to his jacket,
self-detonated.
No details on who he was.
CCTV have no clear images.
There's nothing left of him.
We're bound by procedure.
In this situation,
we cannot afford those constraints.
This is off-reservation.
It's why you're at my home.
I want you to find who's responsible
and stop him
in whatever way you feel fit.
Let it be done quickly.
It'll be you and Mark.
He's young but capable.
Very good with a gun, I hear.
I want it low-tech, old trade craft.
If you get caught,
I don't want evidence.
I'll supply technical backup
and the sweep and clean.
No luck yet with the tracer
you planted in the Semtex
but we did find something curious
of your man Harry.
No bullets in his automatic.
Any thoughts?
Maybe.
You're my hands on this, Ewan,
my conscience.
Wipe it clean.
No loose ends.
Where's Harry?
Fat cheapskate owes me money.
Harry's dead.
I want you to think carefully,
more carefully than you've ever thought.
Was there anything...
Anything unusual happened
in the last few days?
Anything you know
but you're not telling me?
Dead? What are you talking about?
I'm leaving.
You took the bullets from his gun.
Why?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't have time to waste.
I know you know something
and I'm not leaving until you talk,
- one way or another.
Talk.
I don't know anything. Please.
By the time I'm through with your face,
nobody's going to wanna look at you,
let alone pay to fuck you.
He said nothing would happen.
What?
- He told me it was just business.
- Who did?
- A client.
- Which client? Tell me about him.
- Young guy, said his name was Paul.
- Paul?
I saw him regular for two months.
He wanted to know stuff about Harry.
- What stuff?
- What he was up to, his routine,
he paid me extra.
I told him useless stuff-
who he met, what time, his routine,
- just useless stuff.
- What about the bullets?
Said it was a joke to take them out.
Said Harry showed up with a gun.
He wanted to teach him a lesson.
Where did you meet him?
What did he look like?
At his house. Expensive place.
Short hair, brown, slim,
could pass for Greek or Italian
but he was an Arab.
- How do you know?
- I have Arab friends.
I know what the language sounds like.
Heard him speaking it on the phone.
You know his address?
When the bomb went off,
there was a flash,
A lot of glass flying. There was
a lot of people on the ground.
I don't know.
I just felt it more than anything else.
Ash.
Jesus.
How have you been?
Good, yeah. You?
Yeah, I'm good.
Do you, uh, live around here?
No, I'm just... Coffee.
It's good to see you.
Yeah, you too.
I have to go. I'm late for something.
Listen, um... Do you have a number?
If you... If you give me yours, I can...
- If I can get this thing to work.
- It's all right, give me yours.
I'll tap into this.
Um... OK.
- Got it.
Look, I have to go.
I'm really late for something, but...
Really nice to see you again.
Horrific.
What we saw was devastation.
It was just horrific, really.
It was like being in a war zone.
People like, kind of injured,
and their clothes were all, like...
We have with us
today Crispin Jones,
Crispin, what are your thoughts
about the recent spate of bombings?
Well, I think it's too early
for us to speculate
the hallmarks of the bombing
really do point
Cowardly way the bombs were lit
in a public place,
nature of the types of explosives,
and it seems to be...
Off you 9°
Hi.
Can I use your bathroom?
Yeah, you know where it is.
So why are you here?
You always said if I needed any help
I could speak to you.
I need money.
Can I get a drink?
Yeah, sure.
Get your fucking hands up!
- You got me into this!
- Fucking whore!
- Get your hands up!
- Fucking bitch!
- Get away from him!
- You got me into this!
Check outside.
- Hello?
- Why'd you hang up?
Yeah, I didn't know what to say.
Why didn't you move your lips
and something would have come out.
Listen, are you free to meet?
It's a bright,
sunny morning in London town,
Coming up, lots of new music
and a few other surprises in store!
It's Blur, from their last album,
Think Tank.
I love this song.
Oh, God, it's gonna stay in my head
for the whole day now.
Shooting star?
It's going out in beautiful flames.
You remember I said
that I was late a couple of weeks ago?
Yeah.
Well, I came on the other day.
Aren't you relieved?
I'm disappointed, actually.
I mean, obviously, that kid would have
my good looks and massive brain.
When do I get to
meet your mum?
Well, you'd have to put
some clothes on first.
You haven't told her
about me, have you?
Is it cos I'm not a nice Muslim girl?
She doesn't know
that you're a bacon-eating,
lager-drinking sex maniac?
John Major signed a peace treaty
with Sinn Féin
because the IRA's violent actions
forced him to.
Gerry Adams changed from a terrorist
to a politician but it was violence
and legal action that forced the change.
Not one lawyer was involved.
Gerry Adams is a murderer.
This is a law class.
It's not a political forum for you to...
Actually, in today's context
he is recognised and accepted.
He's being invited to have tea
with the Prime Minister, for fuck's sake.
Ash, just keep it civilized.
I'm sorry.
Cos he matched them with violence.
I mean, look at Israel,
created through a violent struggle
and now it's an internationally
recognised state.
In America, the American forefathers
fought the British,
beat them hands down,
and now what are they?
They're the biggest
superpower on this planet.
Why? Because violence
is the supreme authority
all authorities derive
their power and legitimacy from.
Law is completely irrelevant
in the face of true force.
That applies to any country.
And what's your country?
Ash.
Can I have a word?
You may be smart
but you are close to failing.
It's a I'm afraid.
I can handle this.
Ash, do you really want
to practice law?
- Ash?
- Don't worry.
"All right, I'm coming out.
"You, coming out now.
"Any man I see outside
I'm going to shoot.
"Any son of a bitch
who starts to shoot at me,
"I'm going to shoot them, too.
"Then I'm going to kill
all his friends, his family,
"and then second generation,
everybody.
"Then I'm going
to burn their house down."
It's Unforgiven, you know?
Clint Eastwood after he's killed
everyone for murdering his friend,
played by the noble Morgan Freeman.
Oh, man, great actor.
I'm Nabil. You are?
- I'm Ash.
- Ah, Ash.
Like cigarette ash.
It's not your real name, huh?
Don't be ashamed of who you are, huh?
Short for Ashraf, yes?
You look how
they've killed Muslims, huh,
- in Bosnia, Chechnya, Kosovo.
And now they've invaded Iraq
for the bloody oil.
Come to one of my meetings.
Here, take... Take, uh...
Take some of these, yeah?
Take five, you give them
to your friends.
You have friends, don't you?
Your face!
Hey!
Oh, Allah wouldn't be pleased!
Sorry, what did you say?
- What were you guys doing in there?
- Just a little pick-me-up.
Were you doing that shit with him?
Ash, don't start. I'm not in the mood.
Come on, come on.
'Oh!
I"'l!
You all right?
- Let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Get the fuck off me!
- Easy!
Get off me! God.
Come here.
Ash, I'm sorry.
What the fuck's
the matter with you, huh?
Trying to make me
look like a fucking idiot?
- No.
- Doing that shit with him, huh?
That fucking prick.
What were you doing
in the fucking toilets, huh?
- Nothing.
- Sucking his cock?
- I'm sorry.
- Was he feeling...
- Fuck off!
- Come on, Ash.
Just as long as you have
a fucking great time,
you know, fucking get wasted.
You don't give a shit about anything,
do you?
- You don't care about anything.
- Look, I'm sorry.
Listen, look, I'm sorry, OK?
I'm sorry.
I promise I won't do it again.
This is the last time, OK?
You know I love you.
We must rise up against
these Western pigs
who occupy our lands.
Who come at us with smiles
to take what's ours
and turn us against each other.
In this so-called democracy,
if you speak up about
Muslims being slaughtered,
you're an extremist. Huh? Yes?
Yes, yes.
But if you are passive, huh?
Silent, easy to control, huh?
You're a good Muslim. Yes?
Just like a dog, they throw you a bone.
But keep you on a leash, ah?
You know the type of Muslim
I'm talking about.
He's so ashamed of who he is.
He gives himself a Western name.
He tries to think and feel
like his Western master.
Live like him, be him!
You say to him...
My friend, you say to him,
"Let's stop the murder of Muslims."
And he would say,
"You ignorant foreigner,
"you want me to jeopardize
my nice life and my country, huh?"
This is the fool who wears
an England football shirt,
and says,
"Ah, we won the match." Huh?
And the man next to him,
in the same shirt,
he calls him a Paki, hmm?
A nigger.
Ask yourself, "Who are you?"
Really?
All right, matey?
I'll just get a couple of pints, please.
How's Kate?
She was off her head last night.
I've never seen anyone drink
or snort as much as that in my life.
An animal.
So how come you weren't there?
She not tell you she was out?
I wanted her to suck me off
but she passed out.
It's OK, hey, no problem.
It's all right, my friend,
it's no problem, no problem.
Come, come, move, come.
It's all right, it's all right, a racist.
Bastard. Come on.
You know, it felt good, what I did.
You know, sometimes to earn respect,
we have to do things
we wouldn't normally do.
You know, people like us
have to do that
just to get the basic respect
most people take for granted.
In Afghanistan, hmm,
we had to fight to earn respect
and freedom from the Russians.
You were there?
What was it like?
What happens on the battlefield
is between you and God.
I am here now.
God didn't will it for me
to enter paradise.
But I'm content, you know?
Contentment is a state of mind.
Like Palestine.
You know, law is not for me.
I don't want to be part of any hypocrisy.
Look.
Would you call them
dignified human beings, hmm?
They're just having fun.
My friend, no, we are not like them.
What time is it?
You have a rough night?
My head.
Listen, Kate.
I don't think we should
see each other any more.
Why?
Same shit every day.
You don't know when to stop.
I'm 23, for God's sake.
Look, I'll stop when I'm older.
I'm enjoying myself.
Will you just relax, for Christ's sake?
Right, I don't want to see you
any more. OK?
I don't want this any more.
You can go back to sleep if you like.
Oh, what, just like that?
Black and white?
It's so fucking easy for you, isn't it?
You want to end it with me and...
you end it, just like it's nothing.
You want to leave? Just go.
Get over yourself.
Ash!
The terror level
stays at "critical"
and some are calling London
a city under siege.
that it would proceed as planned
with the general election.
We ask whether it would be best
to postpone the election
that an alteration to the election date
would be seen as a victory for...
Nice place.
Swish.
Present for my baby daughter.
You have to check for small parts.
Ever wondered why they do it?
Too simplistic to think
they just hate us?
What does that have to do
with this girl?
Look at her.
Have you served for your country?
No.
I fought over there.
To stop this from happening here.
Again.
Didn't stop. They're not going to stop.
And neither will I.
I'm going to find every one of them...
and send them to the death
they pray for.
Hello?
There's a file for you
at the drop box in 10 minutes.
Come on.
You hesitated before
you gave the safe signal.
Is someone following you?
Maybe.
I couldn't say.
Did you walk here?
Circuits?
I've been down Holborn,
Chancery Lane, Oxford Street.
- Two hours.
- Shall I report it?
I'm not sure.
Bombings are making us all nervous.
Don't worry about it.
They found the receipt in Paul's house
for two pay-as-you-go phones.
Paul had one. The other was used
two hours ago from that building.
The phone was used
to call Afghanistan.
He's in there on his own.
It's not registered to anyone.
It's an abandoned council property.
We can go in round the back.
We go in and take him.
Shots to the head.
Anything else allows him to detonate,
understood?
Yeah.
Come on.
- Get up!
- Ah! No!
Don't! Stop! No!
Where's your jacket, hey?
- I said don't shoot!
- Face the wall!
I said face the fucking wall!
- Face the fucking wall!
- I said don't shoot!
Close the door. Go!
Let me just talk to you, man.
I said let me talk to you!
How many people were you gonna kill?
Just give me a second, please.
Get on your fucking knees!
I don't know what
you're talking about, all right?
- How many?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Just listen to me and calm down,
and me and you can...
An eye for an eye, yeah?
I'm just like you.
I'm just...
I'm just like you, all right?
You're nothing like me,
you fucking animal.
Please, don't!
I can do what I want to you.
I can do anything I want.
You know that?
Please don't!
Move!
Let him burn.
Oh, fucking hell.
The tracer on the Semtex
was kick-started.
This will take you right to it.
Who was the man I just killed?
You have to go now.
Mujeeb Ajmed. Pakistani parents,
At the precise moment
he was signing on, squatting in the flat.
Not a bomber.
What other options
were you faced with?
Considering the past days' events,
your past...
what you've been through,
what we've all been through.
You were not there.
We have removed all traces of you.
It was a squat in a dealer's hangout.
What's done is done.
How did he get the phone?
Stolen, obviously, from Paul.
Do you have anything
that would link you with this incident?
Just his jacket.
Get rid of it.
This is no time to doubt.
Innocent lives are at stake.
Finish it.
Do you remember Ian?
The stoner who used to steal
our milk and top it up with water.
Oh yeah, he used to piss
into a water bottle
cos he couldn't be bothered
to walk to the toilet.
Yeah, I saw three
full bottles in there once.
So what have you been up to
all this time?
Oh, nothing much, just been drifting.
You didn't get into law?
No, it wasn't for me.
I always thought you were
gonna be a high flyer.
Have your own firm.
Not like me. I always knew I'd end up
working in the dullest law practice ever.
Why don't you just quit?
- It's not that easy. I can't just...
- No.
- ...leave my job.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
So are you, um...
Are you married or anything?
No, not married.
Relationships, yeah.
There was this one guy
but that just ended.
No, I loved him.
He just wasn't interested.
Wasted four years of my life.
Lost it a bit, actually.
Still managed to keep my job
at the law firm.
And then I went crazy wanting kids.
Never met anyone.
You?
Nothing serious.
How's your mum?
Is she still trying to get you
to marry a nice Muslim girl?
No. She, um... She died
a couple of years ago.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
You look beautiful.
I hardly ever think about those days.
Uni feels like another life to me.
What you doing?
We, uh, we organise activities
for young Muslims.
Camping in the Brecon Beacons,
rafting, paintball, team bonding.
And we combine these
with religious teachings.
Now, as a successful Muslim
businessman, you want your staff...
- Your Muslim staff.
- ...to be of good character, right?
Thank you for coming to visit me
and for making this offer,
but I'll have to pass.
I don't involve myself
in my workers' private lives.
I'm not a religious man,
but faith is a... a personal thing.
What they do in their own time
is their business,
and that's what's great
about this country.
But thank you.
Great about this country?
Man, this is the same country
that has destroyed so many cultures.
All our cultures.
- Thanks for your time.
- No problem, thank you.
Oh, Muhammed.
Hey, you look well.
Salam aleikum.
Yeah, how are you?
Good to see you, my friend.
Oi! Hamed!
Don't shoot me! I'm only...
Hey, good to see you.
How are you?
Good to see you, good to see you.
- Salam aleikum.
- Yussif, yes?
- Yes, yes.
- Which one is this?
This is the one we send to the boys,
but it's the truth.
You're doing excellent work, very good.
- Thanks.
- Now come, we need to talk, huh?
- Yep.
- Shall I come with you, bruv?
No, just, uh, finish up.
He wasn't interested.
No problem. Ah, there...
There are other business people
we can approach, you know?
It's a matter of, uh, getting their
young workers to join us, huh? Huh?
You know,
this gym was a very good idea.
You're doing very, very well, my friend.
Very, very well.
You want to do more, yes?
What have you got in mind?
A test of your will.
And then we shall see about you.
This is Sergeant Glenn Conlon.
Ex-military with
intelligence associations.
He has served in secret prisons
all over the Middle East,
killing and torturing people we know,
you know, people close to us.
He's not in the services any more,
you know, he's...
bought a farm.
Stables, you know,
he wants the quiet life.
He's retired from killing
and humiliating Muslims.
We don't retire.
We don't forget.
There is a man coming from the
Middle East. An important man.
He lands next week.
You'll go and meet him.
You'll do as he asks.
But he needs your assistance.
Yeah, Yussif.
Good.
You're going to help
our friend with Sergeant Conlon.
Ash raf?
Peaceful streets.
lngleezee.
What?
Englishman.
He gets up at 8:00AM,
goes to the barn,
cleans it for an hour
and then goes to the stables.
Who lives with him?
- Nobody.
- No wife?
No.
When he comes out of his house,
follow him into the barn.
Show him the gun.
We come out, we beat him,
tie him, take him.
You do everything like I tell you to,
you understand?
A knife for you.
No fork.
Go and see what is happening.
I'm going to cut
your head off like a pig's.
- Anyone else here?
- No one.
Put him in the van.
Put your dead friend there, too.
Turn the camera on.
Some breaking news for you now.
A Mr Glenn Conlon
has been reported missing.
Mr Conlon was a banker and
a former private in the Army Reserves.
and her 8-month-old daughter
were found brutally murdered
There is anger in you.
Makes no sense.
Why are you helping us?
You're angry with me about
the woman, the baby.
Do you think he cared for the families
of the men he tortured and killed?
You're confused in the head. Majnoon.
Take it.
These pigs kill our people
all over the world
and you feel for them?
What's the matter with you?
Be a man!
The woman saw my face.
The baby.
You're not one of us.
You haven't suffered like we have.
This is your country.
Well, I am sorry about your friend,
you know.
But he was taken doing God's will.
- A true martyr.
- And that soldier?
I mean, he was just a reserve.
My friend.
Do you think they would publicise
the fact that he was a torturer?
And what about the woman
and the baby, huh?
Collateral damage.
Who invented that phrase? That...
Enough of this!
You know you can't stay
in this country, huh?
Too dangerous. One door closes.
Another opens.
Before our colleague left,
he said you were a capable man.
But that you... You know, you need
experience to see what
these pigs do to your people.
Hmm?
I think he was right.
Afghanistan.
You'll go there, with a new identity,
to our friends.
Be taught useful things,
then you'll come back.
And if you don't return...
then your prize will be more than
anything any one of us could wish for.
Paradise.
It's what you wanted, yes?
An unidentified,
deceased male was found
horrifically burnt in an abandoned
warehouse in East London.
The body was so disfigured
no details of him are available.
The location was
a known drugs factory
There's nothing we could have done.
We were doing our job.
Our job is to do what's right.
What did she mean?
She said something about you.
What was she talking about?
My wife was killed in the bombings
a few years back.
I'm sorry.
She'd have been 34 this year.
She had nothing to do with all...
With all this, you know?
Some days...
Yeah, some days, I...
That thing still in there?
What?
How do you turn it off?
You turn it that way. No.
That way.
The other way.
- The other way. Yeah.
You OK?
Fine.
I remember this.
It's embarrassing.
Look, I'm sorry about what happened.
About the way I acted back then.
If I could change it, I would.
Is everything all right with you, Kate?
- With your life?
- It's fine.
It's not as easy as it used to be,
but don't have to talk about that now.
We just... We slipped away.
I have never stopped
thinking about you, Kate.
You have to know that.
Look, if you have things to do,
we could just meet this afternoon.
I know this pub.
I'd like to.
Where have you been?
Paul was meant to go ahead last night.
He's vanished.
- Were you followed?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
We have to change our plans.
You have to make contact
with the third man and help him.
- You stay with him. I'll be in touch.
- When is he due to go ahead?
Tomorrow.
What's the matter with you?
It isn't time to be weak and emotional.
We have no time for emotions now.
Especially when your brothers
and sisters are suffering.
You know who I am, yeah?
- Yeah.
- Is there anything else?
- Any papers? Receipts?
- No.
OK, use this.
I'm going to go first.
You wait here for a few minutes
and then follow me, OK?
You stay calm.
Have a look round, Mark.
Check round the corner.
Have a look up there.
It's him!
Fuck!
- We got him.
heard.
There was someone there watching.
-
- I don't know.
Somebody across the road.
He got away on a bike.
He's connected.
Get the CCTV footage.
Should be a clear shot of him.
There are two rooms
at the Glassmore Hotel
booked in the name
of Michael and John Smith.
Check in.
I'll be there when I have something.
One more thing. There is a team
on us, our people. Watch yourselves.
Our people? Why?
What we are doing is not
standard. Make sure that...
Where the fuck's she gone?
You look tired.
I'm fine.
It was a nightmare getting
here with all the madness.
What?
There was a bomb scare
on the train coming here.
Scared shitless.
Bunch of murdering maniacs.
Hope they kill the lot of them.
You know when I said I didn't think
about those days at uni any more?
- Yeah.
- I was lying.
I know.
You know, I thought I saw you
once a few years ago.
I just lost you in the crowd.
Well, I'm not going anywhere.
Especially since it's your round.
Can I get a red wine
and orange juice, please?
No problem at all.
There you go. That's £5 exactly.
Thank you.
Good, good. You take it to the car.
Here, you, take...
Take the cake. I will be five minutes.
My son, it's his birthday.
They were there. They knew.
You shouldn't be here.
Your target is an American neo-con.
Head of a think-tank, instrumental
in planning the war on terror.
His daughter is getting married
to an Englishman.
Where?
I'll know tomorrow.
You still have your phone, huh?
God be with you, my friend.
Will I see my family?
What?
Oh, you'll see everyone
who's important in your life.
Everyone who has passed away,
and... And... And it will seem like
only half a day has passed
since you last saw them.
Huh?
You OK?
I'm good.
You did well.
Stay alert.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I know the place.
then I suggest you pay
attention to what I have to say.
For far too long, you've ignored
what is happening around you.
You've not seen the inevitable
that is coming at you.
Who are you, hey?
Who are you working for?
- Talk to me. Who sent you?
You've never opened
your mouths in protest
Answer me!
- Your silence has been deafening.
- Who sent you? Talk!
Look at Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine.
The list goes on and on.
So now I'm going to communicate to
you in a language you can understand.
until I give them life with
your blood and mine.
I'm sure by now your
newspapers and television
an evil outsider
hell-bent on destruction.
will spin my actions to suit
the government agenda.
They want you misinformed,
scared and docile,
so that you continue to ignore
their murderous actions.
They are happy for you
to lose yourself and all that this world
and intoxicated
with their mindless chatter.
So that you do not question
the situation you find yourselves in.
Trapped in a vicious circle
of your own doing.
My life has been a journey
towards violence,
There is no guilt for me.
There is no thoughts of the past
or what I did or didn't do.
My search is over.
a force that's greater
than anything on this world.
You must understand that things
do not happen without reason.
Come in, come in.
So listen carefully
to what I have to say.
Where are you?
Give us your location, where are you?
Everything is in position.
He has entered and heading towards
the kitchen area.
CCTV has been immobilized.
The material world that you
worship is meaningless and empty.
...for something higher than what
this world has to offer.
commit atrocities against
my people all over this world.
Your support for them
makes you responsible.
I will not sit by while my brothers
and sisters are being slaughtered.
The path that has led me here
has been littered with obstacles.
Until you stop the bombing,
imprisonment and torture of my people,
We have entered the realm of war,
and I am a soldier.
Until we feel security,
you will be our targets.
You are all responsible
for turning a blind eye
I'm only a man, but my actions
are the price you pay
I've lived amongst you,
but I'm not a part of you.
Your 9/11s, your 7/7s,
are what my people
suffer on a daily basis
around the world.
and no earthly force can
take them away from me.
You have killed thousands
of my brothers and sisters.
That much death has a consequence
you will pay for with your blood.
There will be more like me,
l promise you.
And we will bring hell
to you and your kind.
What the hell is going on?
You'll need my car.
We need my car.
- Don't! Stop!
- Where's your jacket?
as an undercover agent
for our Secret Services
and infiltrated Nabil Alawi
and his circle.
Three months ago,
I discovered a plot by Nabil
to steal Semtex for the purposes
of an attack on London.
I informed my controllers
to arrest Nabil.
The following day,
the first bomb exploded.
I met with my controllers.
They tried to take my life.
A Secret Service team
are after me now.

accumulated and proof of my identity.
Since sweeping to
power last month in a landslide victory,
the new government has been

Having been given a mandate by
the public with such

and to prioritize making
our country absolutely safe
from these cowardly terrorists.

Service's old guard, Sir Scott Catesby,
and the passing of
more stringent terror laws
which saw the deportation
of the radical cleric Nabil Alawi.

the first official announcement
into the bombings.
The perpetrators
were a home-grown cell.
None had been identified as
potential threats prior to the attacks.

of the intelligence services.
was personally responsible for
the bombing of the Glassmore Hotel.
The bomb was a timed device
placed in a luggage item,
causing a massive explosion
in the foyer of the hotel.
Ahmed himself was
killed by security services
as he tried to trigger a suicide device
just prior to the foyer device exploding.
Helen James, head of the
Glassmore Hotel Victims Committee,
I don't see how you solve
the underlying problem
and I don't think anyone really does.
And, of course, this may lead to...
to, you know, more security
and more troops going out
but I don't see how
that solves the problem.
Ewan! I thought they'd gotten to you.
There you go.
It was with his files.
You must have left it
when you last met.
You knew all about the bombings.
Pretended you were
trying to stop them.
You worked with this Nabil,
then got him safely deported
without arrest.
And I wasn't meant to make it out alive.
You were in line with
a promotion of the new government,
helped them win, got rid of your boss.
Must be happy with you.
Played me perfectly.
Knew all about my wife.
Knew I'd kill anyone you put
in front of me.
You can use her
as an excuse if you want.
But what you do is in your nature.
I love my country.
I'd kill for it and I'd die for it.
Good for you.
The press have been sent
copies of these files.
They show you were responsible.
Those files are nonsense you made up.
No one will believe it.
They might...
if you buckle under
the pressure of the story.
You're out of your mind.
It's in my nature.
