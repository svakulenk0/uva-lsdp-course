It's 73 degrees on this beautiful morning,
it's 6:59 in the A.M.
Well enjoy Mr.Sunshine while you can friends
because news is predicting storms tomorrow.
So it's time to wake up and enjoy the day.
Wake up... Wake up now, Julian!
Julian...
Julian!
JULIAN!
Mister... is that your car?
What?
The cool Porsche.
You keep staring at it.
- Why don't you shoo?
- I don't wanna shoo.
Didn't your mother tell you never
to talk to strangers?
She's over there, and she said
that I should talk to you.
- She did?
- Yes.
She wants to know what you do here.
I think she thinks you're cute.
I don't know anything about that car.
And I'm only interested in your mother
if she lost 20 pounds and 30 years-
- so I'd really like it if you get the
fuck off here, thank you very much.
- Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever, goodbye, scoodoodle!
- See you, would'nt wanna be you.
- Smell you, should'nt have to tell you.
Hi.
- You're up eary.
- The thunder woke me up.
And I wanted to see you before you left.
- I'm gonna miss that.
- Me too, I'll gonna miss everyting.
- It's only two nights.
- With this weather and
our luck, it scares me.
Honey... you know I got to go.
But I'm coming home in two days.
With really good news...
I promise.
Are you sure you have time?
Maybe not for dinner and movie, but...
Still horny?
Danny! Danny!
- I'm so sorry, Phil.
- It's fine, is Bean alright?
Yeah, the fire-department is over there.
She's fine, really...
She practically forced me to get over here.
She knows what this job means, right?
Well, she knows somebody has to pay
for a new kitchen.
- Then we better make this flight, right?
- Yeah, we will.
- We'll have to.
- Hope the weather is better in Mexico.
Mr Noble, how are you today?
Couldn't be better...
but more importantly...
...how are you, Genevive?
Good day.
A Marguerita, please.
I was wondering, I'm looking for a
particulary bloody bullfight.
Any chance one's happening this Sunday?
A matador from Madrid
fights on Sunday.
Are you in town for business or pleasure?
My business is my pleasure.
How you doing?
- I'm a nervous wreck.
- Think positive.
I think that I'm sweating through my suit.
Hallo, Julian!
- Getting some culture?
- Indeed...
Isn't she a tad young?
Even for you...
I'd make an exception for her.
Did you study the assignment?
No, I shredded it, then I humped the bellboy
on the room-service cart.
Am I supposed to be chocked?
I hate these catholic countries.
All blushy, blushy... no sucky, fucky.
Well somehow,
I think you may find your way.
Now look, there's been a change of planes.
The portfolio have to be delivered sooner
than we discussed.
What are you sayin'?
- She's leaving for Europe tomorrow.
- I'm not a fuckin' magician, you know.
Just get it done today.
I almost forgot..!
- Yeah?
- Happy birthday!
Happy birthday?
...fuck.
We shouldn't even need to think about it.
That's good!
- Yes!
- Two Margueritas, please.
- I think we did it. - Yeah, I don't know
what you're freaking out about man.
You were remarkable back there.
- No, you were.
- No, you, it was you.
- It's no way they can't give us this job.
- You think that?
I know...
- Hallo? - Andy?
- Yes?
- Andy, you crazy bastard, it's me.
- Who?
- Julian!
- Who?
Julian Noble, from Portugal,
remember?
- Who?
- Julian Noble?
I'd just thought I've give you a chat,
see how you're doing.
It's my birthday.
Andy? Hallo?
Hallo, is Cindy there?
Fuck it...!
Now this smells like a party.
- Marguerita, please.
- Yes, sir.
Well, you look like you could use one.
Who couldn't?
Margueritas always
taste better in Mexico.
- They certainly do!
- Margueritas and cock.
Thanks...
- Give one for my friend, over there.
- No no, that's...
-Don't worry,
I'm not trying to make a pass at you.
- I'm not worried, but thank you.
- If you're that type of guy...
- No, I mean thank you...
- I don't mean to be rude, but...
- It's alright, I'm just messing with you.
I'm sorry about the cock-comment.
- It kind of conversation-stopped.
- Kind of.
So... what are you doing in Mexico?
Tell me something...
Danny. Danny Wright.
Garrison and Wright.
- Tell me something... Danny Wright.
- Yes, sir!
Why the hell do you care why I'm in Mexico?
- Why so interested?
- No reason...
just a hotelbar-conversation
I guess.
- You're with the firm?
- What's that?
- The agency.
- What?
- Did you following me?
- No, no, I...
- I've make you.
- I've no idea what you're talking about...
I've fuckin' make you.
Okey... I'm gonna excuse myself...
No, no... please!
- Please...
- I'm very tired...
- I didn't mean a word...
- It's okey...
I just get paranoid sometimes,
I was wrong, please!
I'm drunk... and tired.
I've been fornicating for the last 2 hours-
- and before that I've been doing shit.
Horrible business-shit...
I was out of order... lets finish
our drinks, come on.
Here you go...
here's your drink.
And you seem like a nice guy...
You know, a normal guy.
I'm sorry...
Really, it's alright.
So... you're in town on business?
You have that way about you, Danny.
Why so interested?
- That was good.
- Yeah?
- I'm here on business.
- Is it going well?
Very well, I hope.
My partner and I,
he's upstairs... we just had a...
- ...very good pitch-session.
- No shit!
- Very good!
- That's fantastic.
- That's great, Danny!
- I needed a day like this.
I've had a tough couple of years...
I was with this business at Denver,
for nine years...
And out of the blue...
they laid me off.
Yeah, just like that, and...
...it was about two and a half years ago,
I've been struggling back ever since.
And today you go back.
Well... I hope.
- Today, you're a man again.
- Yeah.
And to be a man,
after they fuck you...
...and destroyed your self-respect...
...well, that is a great thing.
Thank you.
Two Margueritas, please.
- Are you married, Danny?
- Yeah, yeah... 14 years.
Let me guess, high-school sweetheart...
- It's true.
- Unbelievable.
That fuckin' american dream,
eh?
Yeah... what about you?
What do you do for living?
Kids...?
You got kids, Danny?
- No, I crossed the line.
- No, you did not.
- Yes I did.
- You did not cross the line.
It's fine.
We lost our son three years ago.
It was a school-bus accident.
And one died...
That was Henry.
We had hard for a while...
- Two mexicans walk into a cantina!
- What?
Two mexicans walk into a cantina.
One of them is a midget, the other one
has a dick that's 15 inches long!
- What are you saying?
- I'm just trying to change the subject.
So the midget says to the bartender:
They call my friend, the human hard-on,
do you know what they call me?
- This is incredible!
- What?
You're very rude.
- I'm just trying to change the subject.
- Thank you very much for the drink.
Goodbye... goodnight, thank you.
Don't you wanna hear the punch-line?
It's a fuckin' good one...
Thanks.
- Are you sure you don't wanna switch?
- No, no, you go.
- You're the one with the kids.
- And you're the one with a tree
in your kitchen.
You wanna flip another coin?
Come on somebody has to stay, I'll call
the minute I hear something.
- Call me sooner.
- Yeah.
- Oh, God!
- What?
Cell-phone,
I think I left it at the front desk.
- Watch my stuff for a sec?
- Yeah, yeah.
- So you're staying an extra few days.
- What?
- I couldn't help but overhear. - So you're
spying on my personal conversations now?
Something about the asshole-buyers
not being completely convinced?
Now they wanna hear about other pitches?
Sorry about that.
I knew things was too good
to be true anyway.
I'm sorry about the circumstances,
bu I'm glad you're still in town-
-because it gives me the opportunity to tell
you how embarrassed I am about last night.
See...
See... the thing is...
I liked you.
I kind of enjoyed talking
to someone, you know.
- Just talking.
- Really?
And yet...
... I tell you about my dead son,
and you mock it.
I lost my wife...
I was 24 years old, I was drunk...
...I crashed our car into an old tree.
And since then I've...
...soiled my way through life,
being a magnifically cold moron.
I run away from emotions.
Thus, you tell me about your dead son...
...I tell you a joke about a 15 inch shlong.
So, you can forgive me?
Got it!
- It's better I remember it now,
before I leave? - Right.
- Okey, speak to you tomorrow?
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be alright.
- I know.
Danny! Hey... wait, Danny!
I've got an extra ticket
to the bullfight this afternoon.
It's supposed to be a good one.
It would mean a great deal
if you could join me.
Thank you... thank you very much.
That's very nice of you, and I...
- ...I can't, I have work.
- On a sunday afternoon?
- Never seen a bullfight?
- No.
You've never seen the real Mexico-city,
until you've seen a bullfight.
Come on...
Bean is not gonna believe this!
I can't wait to tell her.
Where did you find a woman like that?
A woman you can share everything with.
She's pretty special.
Then you must be too,
I could learn from you.
Learn what?
Do you want my mortgage,
my blood-pressure?
If I'd ever had my blood-pressure taken-
- I wouldn't have a mortgage for all the
teenage-girls in Thailand.
- You don't own a house?
- No house.
No apartment, no address.
- You're bullshitting me?
- No, I shit you not.
- Want a cigar?
- Yeah... thanks.
If you don't have a permanent
address, where do you live?
I live wherever I'm working.
So what do you do, Julian?
What do you possibly do, if you don't have
a permanent home or address?
I'd rather not say.
Oh, my God! Did you see that?
Jeez, it's so bloody.
Yeah, they're lucky,
that matador was very good.
- It's much worse when they're mediocre.
- Why?
A great matador can kill a bull
with one plunge on the brain.
A less one, he's have to plunge
that blade more than once.
That makes the crowd very unhappy.
- They don't like to see the bull suffer.
- No.
They clearly care so very much
about these animals.
They respect these beasts.
- They want them to die with honor.
- That's ridiculous.
There's no honor by being killed
by a man with a sword, -
- weather it's 1 plunge or 20.
You're wrong...
You're very wrong.
- There is honor.
- And how would you know?
I do...
You're a mysterious man, Julian.
- And you don't want to tell me what you do?
- It's... confidential.
Confidential? Is your work confidential,
or do you work for the government?
Government... please.
You know what they pay?
Forget it, watch the picadors.
Are you a spy or something like that?
You read to many novels, Danny.
Are you a spy?
You're not gonna tell me,
it's okey...
It's okey.
It's alright...
- If I tell you, will you keep cool?
- What do you mean?
We're on a public place,
and I don't want you to lose your shit.
Lose my shit?
My God, what are you gonna tell me?
Sometimes...
- Sometimes, what?
- Sometimes...
... people need to be eliminated...
Oh, come on!
- What, you're a hitman?
- Oh, please... please.
My handler calls me a "facilitator".
"Facilitator" of fatalities.
- That's insane.
- Think what you like.
I've got to hand it to you Julian, you're
one of the best bullshit-artists I ever met.
- And I've met some.
- You're absolutely right, Danny.
My name is O. Johnson, and I
sell aluminium-siding in Minneapolis.
So you say you actually kill people
for money?
I do what I'm asked to do,
and what makes sense to me.
Kind of like the mob?
I tend to be hired in the more kind of
anonymous, high-paying jobs.
- Cooperate gigs.
- Cooperate gigs?
I'm a great helper at
getting deals closed.
I don't believe you... I don't believe you.
- I don't believe on the easter-bunny.
- I don't believe you for a second.
Come on!
Cooperate gigs?
- Think what you will.
- It's ridiculous!
- Yes.
- Cooperate gigs.
Yes...! My God...
I knew there was a reason
that I never told anyone what I did.
See that guy over there?
- The fat man and the little girl?
- Yeah.
Say I want him dead,
his family dead, dead... right now.
- Right here.
- Right now? Couldn't happen.
I know, but say that you could,
and money is no object.
- Are you sure you wanna know?
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I want you to "facilitate".
Okey, Danny.
Alright, come with me.
Lets go.
I'm a big fan of the "gotta pee"-theory
of assassinations.
- "Gotta pee"?
- Everyone's gotta pee.
- Ask me for a cigarette.
- What?
Do it.
- Can I have a cigarette please?
- Sure.
But these things kill you, you know...
Now look around.
- They're scary. - Yes, and no.
- Why?
They seem more interested in the
beautiful woman coming and going-
- from the ladies-room.
That's good for us.
Just like those men over there
at the concession-stand.
They're only interested in see
us walking there with our wallets open.
No-one is watching the mens-room.
- The "gotta pee"-theory.
- You're catching on.
- Now... escape-routes.
- Escape-routes?
- You don't wanna get caught, right?
- No, no...
- Don't get caught, it sucks.
- Right.
- See the main exit?
- Yeah.
- That's a traffic-jam.
- Where else?
You tell me.
Okey, okey... that door out there.
If it werent' locked.
A vietnamese girl I once knew had her leg
so locked together-
- that I couldn't get in reach
of the "spring-roll".
Two drinks, and I was at a
"all you can eat buffé".
Every lock can be broken.
It's just a matter of will...
...and weather it's worth it.
This looks like it's worth it.
Why are we buying the cigarettes?
Because I wanna smoke.
Come over here.
Now, do your shoe-laces on.
What time is our flight
to Florida, Seymore?
I think two o'clock, Derek.
Let's go, Seymore.
Holy shit!
- Are you ready?
- Ready for what?
- You wanted to see what I do, right?
- Yes!
Yes, I've been watching...
Showtime is over,
the real deal is about to start.
"The real deal"?
Showtime is for sissies.
But a sissy I'm not.
- Come on!
- We got fire!
- That's for the distraction.
- Easy.
Fire will distract most cops.
Are you ready to finish what we started?
Julian, that was extremely dangerous...
I think you proved your point.
The cops may have gone to the fire,
but his bodyguard is probably still upfront.
Bodyguard?
Those who are afraid of being killed,
always have a bodyguard.
If they didn't... They'd asked you.
So, I'd slit the guards throat,
push him back at the bathroom...
And now we're set up for the kill.
Were the hell did you get the knife?
It must be number two...
- Okey, joke's over... let's go, Julian!
-Not yet!
Not yet, not yet...
Come on, let's get out of here.
Don't fuckin' ruin things, okey?
Okey. Julian!
- I asked you to stop this.
- No way, the job's not done.
- This is not a job!
- You said money was no object.
Bingo! Was his name...!
- This is what you wanted, right?
- No!
- This is what you helped with.
- I didn't help you!
- Oh, yes you did...
- No, no, no!
Oh God, no...!
Fun, eh?
Come on!
That was incredible,
you scared the hell out of me!
- You liked that, didn't you?
- I really bought it.
A stranger...
just like that!
- A complete stranger.
- Yes, I did...
- I'm not psychotic.
- No, I know, I know...
- Psychopathic perhaps, but not psychotic.
- I don't think you're a psychopath.
I kill people, doesn't that seem a bit
psychopatic to you?
- Yeah, but...
- Don't get the wrong impression...
Just because we share alot, doesn't mean
I'm not unsavory.
No, what you do is unsavory.
You know what they say...
you are what you do.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
Tell me...
Will Bean stay with you
if this job doesn't come through?
What?
Will Bean stay with you if you continue
this losing-streak without any end?
- If she ever left me, I'd fall apart...
- You're not answering my question.
To be quite honest...
... I don't know how much faith
the woman have left in her.
Comforting me?
Just change the subject, please.
- I will.
- Something sunnier!
Sunnier...! Absolutely.
In fact there's something
I'd wanted to talk to you about.
- A favor, really.
- Sure.
- It's pretty big, it's a pretty big favor.
- It's okey.
See... the thing is...
...I could use your help.
- Help with what?
- I'm down here...
I finish my other job early,
so I let it be known.
- "Let it be known"?
- Yes.
To the powers that made
that I was available.
- The powers of B?
- Yeah, anyway...
They called me, emergency...
it has to happen today.
Another job?
The thing is...
I could really use your help.
You're kidding right now?
I'm as serious as an erections-problem.
- I can't help you, Julian.
- You could.
I could, but I can't...
I'm not gonna help you-
- to kill an innocent man.
- Who says he's innocent?
- This is ridiculous!
- You'll just be assisting.
- No!
-You just have to go out...
I'm not listening.
I can't hear you, I can't hear you.
You're being childish.
You're being childish.
You're being childish.
All I'm asking you to do, is just go...
Alright, alright.
I won't tell you.
- Good.
- Won't mention it.
Great!
All I'm saying, that all you have to do
is trip on the street right next to him.
I can't believe you said that...
Just trip and fall in about half an hour so
his body get turned, and look the other way.
No way.
That's what I got paid.
- No!
- It's alot of money.
Cash.
And it could be real interesting.
No! I said no!
He's a prick, Danny!
A real prick!
I don't give a darn who he is,
or what he did, or anything like that.
I'm not gonna help you, Julian.
I'm not gonna do that!
And if you bring it up again, I'll leave.
- Fine.
- Fine.
- Change the subject.
- Good, you do.
- Change it...
- You.
- Fine.
- Okey.
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a cheerleader.
Really?
A cheerleader?
Yeah. I wanted to be thrown in the air
and march in the band.
Seriously?
So funny, I've got an brother-inlaw
who's a male cheerleader-fan...
God, Danny!
I'm fuckin' kidding!
I didn't want to be cheerleader!
I don't want to talk about cheerleaders
unless I'm getting in a shower with them.
I wanna talk what I wanted to talk about,
which you don't wanna talk about!
There's nothing to talk about!
Well then... it's nice knowing you.
No... Julian.
Come on.
You're just leaving?
You're gonna leave?
- I got business to attend to.
- I really thought...
Nothing... think nothing.
Just consider me the best
cocktail-drinker you ever met.
Bye, Danny.
Julian!
So unfortunally I was right.
I finally got in touch with
Al Handren.
She said att her boss's are leaning
towards Cardinous, and his group...
...and not us.
Things may still break in our favor,
their first instinct was to go with us,
but they're getting pretty intense pressure
to sign with a Mexican company.
I'm trying to get Antonio so I can
set up one more meeting -
- with you guys tomorrow.
I call you when I hear something.
So, hang in there... it's not over yet.
Danny!
Danny, it's Julian!
Come on, Danny,
I just want to say I'm sorry.
I know it's late,
and I'm a bit fucked up, but...
I'm sorry.
I'm a mess,
I'm a fuckup!
I should'nt have
asked you to help me.
I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed
on your kindness, but please...
Let me tell you I'm sorry.
Let me apologise!
Can't you see how
guilty I feel?
Danny!
Hello, Julian!
Getting some culture?
Anytime I can.
You look tired.
I am...
I need a break.
What are you sayin', Julian?
Moscow, Las Vegas, Vienna, Philippines...
...and now Budapest? I'm exhausted.
You know what it's like...
...you take a break,
We go with the younger cheaper kid.
If he does alright, then maybe we don't want
you back, when you're ready to get back.
You'll always want me.
No, not always.
Not if we can save a few dollars.
Not if it gets sloppy again,
like in Manilla.
That was one time...
It made some people nervous.
It made me nervous.
Well, that's why I need a break.
I don't want to have something like that
happen again.
- It can't.
- I know, but that's what I'm saying...
But I'm fuckin' burnt out,
I'm feeling... shaky.
Can you believe this shit...
Can you believe the words
coming out of my mouth?
Did you ever think you'd lived
to see the day?
I never thought you'd lived to see the day.
There's no retirement-home
for assassins, is there?
archery at 4:00, rifle at 5:00,
bird-dinner at 6:00...
Julian, if you leave the game,
even for a while...
...I don't know if they'll
let you back in.
And then what the hell are you gonna do?
Waste your days
to pick upp a bunch of teenagers?
For suck'n fuck-sessions,
behind the old navy-store?
- Sounds great to me.
- Julian. Do this job.
Do it, because if you don't, you'll
regret it, and I can promise you that.
How do you know?
Just do it, Julian.
Please, do it.
Okey?
We have a problem, mr Randy.
The problem is Julian Noble. It seems
he didn't deliver the portfolio.
Do you know...
...it says it took 53 years
to paint this ceiling.
People are upset, mr Randy.
Mr Stick is upset.
- Stick knows?
- Mr Stick knows...
Well, he knows we can fix it.
- I'm just the messenger.
- But he knows we can fix it!
- We always fix any problems.
- And fix it with Noble.
Ladies...
Alright, I'm gonna replace him.
No... Yes.
You'll replace him,
but no.
Mr Stick have asked for other things.
No, it's ridiculous.
Julian has been with us for 22 years,
two little misstakes...
Julian Noble... is a dead man.
Take me, Danny-boy!
Excellent...
Laundry's done...
Tomorrow it's 4 years.
I know...
It's such a long time really,
when you think about it.
It seems like yesterday, right?
Henry was alive...
When I was first in high-school
I told you they'd made fun of me...
When they called me hippo-hips...
played-beans.. the works.
And even though I did basketball,
and chorus, and...
I had a few friends and I acted strong,
I never was...
...because I believed them,
always, every last cruel... word.
And I always thought I would believe them.
Until I met you...
You arrived at 12th grade.
And you told me...
That I was pretty, and for the first time
I believed it.
You told me that I was sexy.
You were sexy back there, in the dryer.
And when Henry died...
...you told me to stay strong!
And that we would get through it.
And we did.
We did...
- That's because you never gave up on me.
- I never could.
I never will.
Who could that be,
at 11:30 at night?
Yeah?
- Danny Wright?
- Yes.
Who's there?
Danny, Danny!
Danny, with the large white fanny!
- Julian!
- Would you mind opening up, Danny?
It's freezing out here,
my balls are like bon-bons.
I've always praying you'd remember me.
It's been a spell.
- Please, please, come on in.
- Thank you.
I've decided to...
How did you find me?
I've found a whore
with a heart of gold once, -
- I can certainly find Danny Wright's
card in my addressbook.
- Excuse me, I didn't realise.
- It's okey.
- You must be Bean.
- My wife.
I've heard so much about you...
And me, you.
There's no doubt you're every bit
as lovely as Danny said.
I always said you were the
luckiest man I ever met.
What are you doing here, Julian?
I really don't know...
I don't know.
I hope it's alright I'm being here,
I mean...
... it's at the middle of the night!
- Yes.
- Well...
I could sure use some coffee,
just a cup.
Yes, right, of course.
I can get some coffee.
That'd be great!
- Or maybe some whisky?
- That's even better.
- Tonight's the night for whisky then.
- And song and dance...
Well, whisky atleast.
This is really odd.
Really, really odd.
- I can ask him to leave.
- We just asked him to stay.
- We could change our minds.
- Why? Do you think he's dangerous?
He's an assassin, Bean.
Of course he's dangerous.
But I mean dangerous, dangerous,
you said he was a nice guy.
He is... for an assassin
he's very nice.
Fuck!
Fuckety-fuck...
What? I'm allowed to curse.
- Especially now. If not now, when?
- True.
It's the fuckin' perfect time
to be fuckin' cursing.
There's a fuckin' killer standing,
in our fuckin' living-room.
Do you think he would show me his gun?
A toast, maybe?
To a stranger,
arriving in the middle of the night.
- Well, you're not a stranger...
- No, I'm pretty strange.
Be that as it may, you're not a stranger,
Julian. Far from it.
The toast really should be to you, Danny...
and to you, Bean.
For your hospitality, and your warmth.
I never thought I'd see you again, Julian.
I never thought I'd see you again,
Danny, but...
...things change.
They just change...
Is that...
- You saved it.
- I did.
You saved it, I can't believe it.
He still talks about that
all the time.
It touches me that you kept it.
How could I not?
- That was a special day.
- Yes.
So Danny told you
what I did?
Professionally?
Did you bring your gun?
Yes...
As a matter of fact.
- May I see it?
- Really?
- Yes, please.
- Honey, he's not just gonna...
- Here, hold...
- Okey.
- Is that a 38?
- Yes, it is.
You know your guns, Bean.
- Yes, well...
- My God...!
You are a magnificient woman.
Bean knows a lot of things about
a lot of things.
Bean, tell me...
Did Danny tell you everything
about our time in Mexico together?
Yes, I'm sure.
Why?
My God, you look great, Danny.
Really great.
You do too, Julian.
Oh, no. I look like a Bangkok-hooker, on a
sunday morning, after the navy left town.
But you...life's been good to you,
am I right?
Pretty good, yeah.
You have that respect you wanted
back again?
I do.
So you got that job
you were in Mexico for?
- We did.
- And your luck?
It's better, right?
No more trees in the kitchen?
You told him about that?
And you love Bean more than ever.
That, I do.
Then, what more could you want?
Here's a toast...
...to a man with respect again...
To a woman that's more lovely
than any man deserves.
And to me.
What is the toast to you for?
A toast to a dead man, Bean.
A toast to a dead man...
For about 2 months ago
I had a job in Manilla.
Normally, this would make me happy.
I like the hot climate,
and the guys looks like chicks
It's fuckin' fantastic.
The thing was...
I was burnt out.
I didn't know it, I didn't even know
what "burnt out" meant at the time.
But I was!
I was a classic textbook-case.
I was having panic-attacks. I was
completely losing control of myself...
I tried to counter this with booze,
of course, but...
Nothing was working...
I drank, and drank, and...
Nothing... I was so feeling edgy.
Still feeling like my head
was gonna explode.
So...
I moved on to my other usual diversions.
A wonderful little whore-house.
That wasn't working either.
And a good fuck usually does.
Excuse my french.
So I had this assignment,
nothing special...
Some executive.
Someone doesn't want him around.
You know, my usual-type gig.
I knew that this cooperate-guy
always came to a market-
-every thursday, to buy fruit.
The guy liked his fruit.
As he walks through the crowds,
I bump into him.. and stab him.
The thing was, I was still a mess.
And every time I looked at the guy,
I didn't see him.
But I saw a little boy instead.
And it wasn't just any boy.
It was me... me, as a child!
Freaky shit, right?
Real nervous breakdown,
sort of stuff.
I stood ready with the knife,
still prepared for the job.
I couldn't do it.
I just couldn't do it.
Then what happened?
I woke up in a pile of donkey-shit.
I fainted. I guess I landed in a pile
of donkey-shit.
And since then...
...it's been extremely cold.
Some jobs goes okey...
...others, not so okey.
And, in a few weeks ago,
I fucked up again, in Budapest.
I frooze, right at the moment
I should have been firing.
I didn't finish the job,
and that was that.
Now it's just a matter of time.
Isn't there somebody that you can talk to?
Like Mary Beth in human-resources?
This is insane. Are they gonna kill you
for failing a job?
Can't you just... say to them...
"I'm sorry"...
"I was a little burnt out,
and I'm a little messed up"...
Can't you do that?
I mean, you saw images of yourself
as a small boy.
If that is not a nervous breakdown,
I don't know what is.
- Certainly they have to see that.
- No, they don't, they don't.
I'd be dead now if my handler hadn't risked
his life and tipped me off the company plan.
I barely got out of Budapest alive.
And how did you end up here...?
In Denver.
It's funny.
Some people are at home
in the time of crises.
My problem... problem
I shared with Danny in Mexico...
...is that I don't have a home.
I mean...
That's why I'm here.
You're the only friends I have.
But that's ridiculous...
you have friends.
I don't, I really don't.
You're it,
it's fucking crazy, right?
You're my only friends
and I barely know you.
This home...
Your home...
...is the only home I know.
She's really fantastic, Danny.
- She's lovely.
- She means everything to me.
You said that to me in Mexico.
I nodded and listened,
but now I see.
I see...
Did you told her everything that
happened in Mexico?
I told her about our time together, yes.
And where does that story end?
She knows the last I heard of you-
- you where knocking on my hotel-room
in the middle of the night-
- asking forgiveness for trying
to involve me in a job.
That's what you said?
That I knocked and knocked...
- And you never answered?
- Yes.
Gentlemen!
I'm a bit drunk.
It's a nice place to be.
Julian, you will stay the night of course?
Thank you, Bean. I promise
I'll be out of here tomorrow.
Let's not talk about that now.
I don't think I've been up with guests
til 2:30 in the morning... in a long time.
- It's good, right?
- Oh, it's very good.
- Can I turn on your stereo?
- Sure... now?
Yeah, I saw an old record of yours that I'd
like to hear in the small hours the morning.
Since we're in the small hours
of the morning, is that okey?
Certainly.
Yes, yes...
Danny?
I hope you approve, I'd really want
to ask your wife for a dance.
Julian, you've had to much to drink.
Bean... please, may I have this dance?
Bravo...! Bravo!
I learnt to dance in a
south-american jail.
Well, that's another story...
another time.
The final night-cap!
I can't even think of
how I'll get up in the morning.
Then don't!
What you do...
take 3 aspirins in a row,
before you go to bed tonight.
Where'd you hear that one?
Assassins book of home-remedys?
The only woman that I ever loved...
...my mother.
What about your wife?
My wife?
Danny told me that you were married,
and that she died in a car-accident.
You loved her!
Oh, my God!
- I can't believe this!
- I was never married.
I can't believe this...
- There wasn't a car-accident?
- No.
I'd been insensitive to Danny, about your
son, and I was trying to win him over-
- it was juvenile, stupid. - You know what,
Julian, I'm the one that was stupid!
No, no, no, you're not stupid.
I'm a prick!
It's me, not you!
I could have kept lying now,
but I chose not to, as a sign of..
-respect... because now, we're friends.
We are friends, aren't we?
What other bullshit
did you pour over me, Julian?
Are you even a hitman, Julian?
-or what the fuck you call yourself.
Yes, I am.
Is that the answer to your question, Danny?
I lie when I need to.
And tell the truth when I can.
With you...
It's mostly been the truth.
Should I go?
- No.
- No.
Aren't we fucking cosmopolitan?
Having a trained assassin,
stay over the night?
Letting heartbreaking lies
roll over us, like the summer-breeze.
Next we should be wife-swapping?
You don't have a wife...
remember?
That's a good point.
Danny... Danny!
- Danny!
- No.. I have...
Come on, I got to talk to you.
What's it, Julian?
What do you want?
- I can't talk about it here.
- What?
Come on!
Okey, Julian, we're in your rental-car.
What is it?
The thing is, Danny...
the thing I didn't tell you.
The thing I hide,
because Bean was present.
Was that I've been offered a way out
of my fatal situation.
- That's good.
- Yeah, I know.
That's really good, what is it?
My handler, mr Randy, contacted me
like he always does.
With an add in the international tribune
looking cat-salers in Bali.
Is that how you stayed in contact?
Cats or the rats?
Yeah.
Okey, this is ridiculous,
I'm so tired, Julian.
He contacted me 4 days ago, and basically,
he said he's been at the higher-ups.
And got me a reprieve.
Well like I said,
that's great news!
The thing is, he's asking me
to do one more job.
I have no choice,
it's do the job, or else...
And it brings us to the
dirty little problem.
What's the problem?
Well, actually it's a pretty big problem.
And you really not gonna like it.
- I'm not gonna like it?
- Not at all.
Because the job... involves you.
You're not saying,
what I think you're saying?
What do you think I'm saying?
You know what I think you're saying...
No, I don't think I know what you think,
I'm saying.
Someone wants me dead?
No, no one wants you dead, Danny!
But I need your help
in facilitating the fatality.
- What?
- I need your help.
No, no, my help is exacly
what you don't need.
I'm a mess, Danny.
You know that.
I'm a complete mess,
I don't know if I can do this job by myself.
You got to talk to somebody else,
a college!
- I don't know any colleges.
- You must!
- I don't.
- Well, I can't help you!
Danny, I know you're not
the ideal-candidate.
Ideal? Far, far from ideal, Julian.
Don't you remember my reaction-
-the last time you proposed something
this utterly stupid?
It was just in Mexico,
I was just trying to show you a good time!
So now, killing somebody is a good time?
It can be.
- I'm going to sleep.
- Danny! Come on...
Why do you need a second person?
Haven't you done all these things yourself?
Some jobs are better with two men.
Well, I think it's better that the
...and unprepared, and unqualified,
I'm not interested-
-I'm gonna go to bed, Julian.
I'm in a very dangerous
position here, Danny.
I'm in no shape to try this myself.
An assassin without confidence
is a horrible thing to behold.
It's like a relief-picture
who fumbles the ball.
Please, tell me you know you mixed
I can't do that.
Danny, please, please!
I need your help!
Someone's gonna die.
A stranger, or me.
Which would you rather?
Look, if I can do the job successfully,
I'm free and clear.
Free and clear, Danny!
I have enough money saved up
to retire to a beautiful greek island-
-with beautiful little greeks.
Heaven awaits me, Danny,
if you and I do this job.
- I can't!
- God damnit, Danny!
- You're my only friend!
- Julian...!
It's true, and...
- What?
- And...
You owe me...
- If this would happen,
when would it take place? - Today.
The horse-races.
- Today?
- Yeah, in Arizona.
No, no, that couldn't happen, Julian.
No choice.
No, today is the 4 year anniversary
of my son Henry's death.
We go to the semetary.
What time does the semetary close, Danny?
I don't know...
We'll have you back here 4:30,
I promise you.
Oh, you do that, okey...
Well, how will you do that, Julian?
We have a 7:40 plane-reservation
to Tucson this morning.
Plenty of time to catch the 2:30 back.
We do?
I made it yesterday, first class.
Real fancy, now, chop-chop, upstairs,
get dressed, make a story up to Bean.
We got to get this road on the show.
I just leaned against that.
I was yawning and I just..
Turn it off!
I'm sorry...
Hey... Julian!
Julian!
Julian!
Julian?
What the hell is going on?
Julian?
You drag me out to Arizona.
To the god-damned horse-races?
To do this job, right?
To do this job, right.
To do this one last job...
To kill somebody I don't even know-
-so that you could live out
the rest of your life with greeks!
Beautiful little greeks standing...
We do... I do everything perfectly.
Not you... me! Perfectly.
Did you see me, Julian?
I was brilliant!
You got a clean shot,
I know you had a clean shot.
And you don't take it!
What's going on?
I've lost it, Danny.
Really?
Then they're gonna kill you, Julian.
But I've lost it...
- That's an unacceptable answer!
- But it's the truth.
Oh, please...
Concentrate here, okey?
I need you to concentrate.
Just look at me, Danny.
Look at me... I'm a wreck!
- I'm a parody.
- Julian!
- You got to get up there,
and finish this job. - No, no, no.
No, just leave me alone, Danny.
Please, just forget everything.
I can't believe,
I'm in a stairway-
-  trying to convince you to
assassinate somebody!
Just go... just go... go.
No.
- No, we're gonna do this.
- My God!
Julian, you have to... you have to, okey?
If you don't, they're gonna kill you,
do you understand me?
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.
And I won't let that happen.
I refuse to let that happen,
how about that?
We're gonna walk there together,
and I'll talk you through it.
Okey? I'm gonna talk you right through it,
and you're gonna do the job.
- Okey? - Yes.
- Okey, alright!
Okey...
Up, up, up!
There you go.
Okey?
- And you gonna stay up there with me.
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Thank you.
- Alright, then...
Let's go kill this fucker already,
and get the hell out of here!
Thank you.
Really, I mean it.
I was a mess back there.
You helped me.
You helped me alot.
You know I think I can
handle the deviant-Julian.
I can handle the lying-Julian.
I can even handle the killing-Julian.
I just don't know if I can handle
the weak-Julian.
Well, enjoy it. It won't last...
That's a given.
Really...
it's no problem.
You said it yourself..
I owed you.
Do you think, if you hadn't open that door
late that night in Mexico city-
- the two of us would be sitting
on this plane now?
Probably not.
Come on, Danny!
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
I know it's late,
and I'm a little fucked up, but...
I'm sorry...
Can't you see how guilty I feel?
Danny!
- Danny!
- Hold on, Julian! I'm coming.
I don't know what'll I do
if I don't get this job.
And you're sure if I kill off this guy,
you'll get the contract?
It's the only competition.
And you can live with that?
- Yeah.
- You can live with that blood on you hands?
That's what people do.
Dumb people...
and successful people...
always live with blood on their hands?
You became my friend that night, Julian.
You became my life-long friend...
I'm not going to do it for you.
You're making it on a late night...
an exhausted desperate decision.
And if I did it...
You would regret it instantly.
And feel guilt and shame
for the rest of you life, believe me.
I'm so scared, Julian.
Guys like you...
...you think you've no luck?
But you got all the luck in the world.
You just need to see it.
She's at home,
waiting for you.
If I did that job for you...
...your luck would run bad,
for the rest of your days.
You don't really wanna do it anyway,
I know you don't.
You're not that type of person.
That's why I like you.
You're the exact opposite of me.
You surprised me that night.
I surprised myself.
I guess your boss must be satisfied, right?
You completed the assignment...
no longer on the hit-list.
Well, I'm no longer on the hit-list,
but I didn't do any assignment.
I don't understand, I thought your boss
wanted you to do this job!
My boss, mr Stick...
he was the job.
- Do you mean we just killed...
- We killed the man who wanted to kill me.
Problem solved.
You...
You son of a bitch!
Among many other things...
- Don't ever hit me again.
- Sorry...
