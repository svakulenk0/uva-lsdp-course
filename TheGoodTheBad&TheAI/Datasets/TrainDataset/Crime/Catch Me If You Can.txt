JOE GARAGIOLA:
Thank you very much
and welcome
to
Our first guest,
he's made a career
out of being
the most outrageous impostor
that we've ever come across
on this show
and you're going to see
what I mean.
ANNOUNCER:
Number One
what is your name, please?
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.
Number Two?
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.
Number Three?
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.
GARAGIOLA:
"From 1964 to 1967
"I successfully impersonated
"an airline pilot
for Pan Am Airways
"and I flew over
two million miles for free.
"During that time, I was also
the chief resident pediatrician
"at a Georgia hospital
"and an assistant
attorney general
"for the State of Louisiana.
"By the time I was caught,
I was considered
"the youngest and most daring
con man in U.S. History.
"I had cashed almost $4 million
in fraudulent checks
"in 26 foreign countries
and all 50 states.
"And I did it all
before my 19th birthday.
My name is
Frank William Abagnale."
You don't know how
to tell the truth...
You don't know how
to tell the truth...
So, for the first time
he's going to have
to tell the truth
and we're going to start
our questioning with Kitty.
Thank you. Number One,
why, with all your talent...
and you're obviously
a very bright fellow...
why didn't you go in
for a legitimate profession?
It was really a question
of dollars and cents.
When I was a young man,
I needed the money
and I thought
this list of careers
was the easiest way to get it.
I see.
Number Two, I find this all
very fascinating.
Who was it
that finally caught you?
His name was Carl Hanratty.
:
Han-an-an-ratty.
Ratty.
:
Hanratty.
Han-ratty.
Carl Hanratty.
- Yes.
- I...
am... Carl Hanratty.
I represent the FBI from
the United States of America.
Yeah. I have orders
to see the American
prisoner, Abagnale.
Marseille, France
Christmas Eve 1969
You sit here.
You do not open the door.
You do not pass him...
anything through the hole.
Aw... Jesus.
You know, I've got
a little bit of a cold myself.
- Frank...
-
I'm here to read
the articles of extradition
according to the
European Court for Human Rights.
"Article One:
Extradition shall be granted
"in respect of offenses
punishable under the laws..."
:
Help me.
"...for the maximum period
of at least one year
of a severe penalty."
Help me.
Frank... stop it.
Help me.
You don't think actually
you can fool me, do you?
Stay with me.
Article Two:
"If the request for extradition
"includes several separate
offenses
each of which is punishable
under the laws..."
"Of the requesting party..."
Frank?
Frank?
Goddamn it!
- Get me a doctor in here!
-
- I need a doctor!
- Yes.
Doctor! Now!
HANRATTY:
Don't sweat it, Frank.
We're going to get you
right to a doctor.
Frank, if you can
hear me, don't worry.
I'm going to take you
home in the morning.
Home in the morning, Frank.
What are you doing?
Washing off the lice.
This man has to be on a plane
for America.
He has to see a doctor.
The doctor comes in tomorrow.
I have worked too long, too hard
for you to take this
away from me.
If he dies,
I'm holding you responsible.
Monsieur!
Ah, Frank.
Okay, Carl...
let's go home.
MAN:
In all those years
we've only seen a handful
of deserving gentlemen
inducted as lifetime members.
It's an honor that, uh
that has seen 57 names enshrined
on the wall of honor
and tonight, we make it 58.
So please stand as I present
my very good friend
a man who keeps
our pencils sharp...
And our pens in ink...
Frank William Abagnale.
Six years earlier
New Rochelle, New York 1963
I stand here humbled
by the presence
of Mayor Robert Wagner...
...and our club president,
Jack Barnes.
Most of all, I'm honored to see
my loving wife Paula...
...and my son, Frank Jr...
Frank... Aw, stand up.
Come on...
:
...sitting in the front row.
Two little mice fell
in a bucket of cream.
The first mouse quickly gave up
and drowned.
The second mouse...
wouldn't quit.
He struggled so hard
that eventually he churned
that cream into butter
and crawled out.
Gentlemen, as of this moment,
I am that second mouse.
PAULA:
You're a better dancer
than your father, Frankie.
You hear that, Daddy?
FRANK SR:
Like fun.
PAULA:
The girls don't know
what they're in for.
Show him the dance
you were doing when we met.
Ah, who can remember?
The people
in that little French village
were so happy to see Americans
they decided
to put on a show for us.
So they crammed 200 soldiers...
Yeah, we know the story, Daddy.
...into that tiny social hall
and the first person
to walk onstage
is your mother,
and she starts to dance.
You know, it had been months
since we'd even seen a woman
and here's this blonde angel.
Blonde bombshell.
And the men are literally
holding their breath.
Holding their breath for you.
You hear that?
Mm-hmm.
And I turned to my buddies
and I said...
"I will not leave France
without her."
And I didn't.
You didn't.
I didn't.
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, the rug!
Aw, Mom...
I can't believe I did that.
No, no, it's nothing.
It's nothing.
Oh, Frankie, Frankie,
get a towel.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Paula...
Come on.
My sweet embraceable you...
Dance with me, Paula.
Ah...
Whenever I dance for you
I get in trouble.
:
Watch this.
Oh!
Frank! Wake up.
Come on, let's go!
Get up. Come on, come on.
Frank, wake up.
:
Dad...
You don't have to go
to school today.
It's okay.
Why? Is it snowing?
Do you have a black suit?
I overslept again, huh?
We have a very important
meeting in the city.
Eat that.
Come on, come on, eat.
Ma'am, open up.
Just open up, please!
- Ma'am?
- It's important.
What?
Oh, gosh!
We don't open
for half an hour!
Open the door, please.
Just open the door.
It's important.
L-I'm sorry, we don't open
for half an hour.
What's your name, ma'am?
Darcy.
Darcy. That's a pretty name.
I'm in a bit of a fix.
I need a suit for my kid.
This is my son Frank.
Oh, hi.
He needs a black suit.
Black suit...
There was a death in the family.
My father, 85 years old,
war hero.
Yeah?
There's a funeral
this afternoon, military funeral
planes flying overhead,
Geez.
Frank needs to borrow a suit
for a couple of hours.
I'm sorry, we don't loan suits,
and we're not open.
Darcy... Darcy, please.
-
- Come back.
Darcy... is this yours?
I just found it
in the parking lot.
Uh-huh.
It must've slipped
right off your neck.
Don't hit the curb.
Now get out,
walk around the back
and hold the door open for me.
All right.
What's next?
Okay, stop grinning.
When I get inside, you go back
to the front seat and wait.
Even if a cop comes
and writes you a ticket
you don't move the car,
understood?
Dad, wha-what's all this for?
You know why the Yankees
always win, Frank?
'Cause they have Mickey Mantle?
No, it's 'cause the other teams
can't stop staring
at those damn pinstripes.
Watch this.
The manager
of Chase Manhattan Bank
is about to open the door
for your father.
Mr. Abagnale, um
we don't usually
loan money to people
who have unresolved business
with the IRS.
That's a misunderstanding.
I hired the wrong guy
to do my books.
A mistake, I...
anybody could make it.
I just need you guys
to help me weather the storm.
Sir, you're being investigated
by the government for tax fraud.
My store is a landmark
in New Rochelle.
I have customers
all over New York.
Well, you're not a customer
at Chase Manhattan.
We don't know you.
I'm sure your bank
in New Rochelle
they know you,
they could help you out.
My bank went out of business.
Banks like this one put
them out of business.
Now, I know I made a mistake,
I admit that
but these people want blood.
They want my store.
They've threatened
to put me in jail.
This is America, right?
I'm not a criminal.
I'm a Medal of Honor winner
a lifetime member
of the New Rochelle Rotary Club.
All I'm asking is for you
to help me beat these guys.
It's not a question
of winning and losing.
It's a question of risk.
You're the largest bank
in the world.
Where's the fu...
Whe... Where's the risk?
Dad, how could you just let him
take our car like that?
He didn't take anything.
We took him.
He overpaid by $500.
Come on, Frank.
Let's return the suit.
This place is good.
It's small but, you know
it's going to be
a lot less work.
A lot less work for you.
FRANK:
Hey, Dad.
Hi.
Where's your mother?
I don't know.
She said something
about going to look for a job.
What's she gonna be
a shoe salesman
at a centipede farm?
What are you doing?
You want some pancakes?
For dinner?
On my son's 16th birthday?
We're not gonna eat pancakes.
Come on, why are you looking
at me like that?
You thought I forgot?
- I didn't think you forgot.
- I opened a checking account
in your name.
I put $25 in the account
so you can buy
whatever you want.
Don't tell your mother.
I won't.
Thanks, Dad.
Yep.
Didn't that bank turn you down
for a loan, though?
Yes, they all turned me down.
Then why you opening
a banking account with them?
Well, because one day,
you'll want something
from these people...
a house, a car.
They have all the money.
There's 50 checks there, Frank
which means, from this day on...
you're in their little club.
I'm in their little club.
You got that, you got it all.
It's even got my name there,
huh?
To the moon.
- To the moon!
- To the moon.
See that? It's just a school.
No different than Westbourne.
Ma... you said you were
going to quit.
Frankie, you don't have
to wear the uniform here.
Why don't you take off
your jacket?
I'm used to it.
Excuse me.
Oh, yes?
Do you know
where room 17 French is?
GIRL:
Yeah, it's...
BOY:
But you frickin' killed him.
You selling encyclopedias?
Yeah, he looks like
a substitute teacher.
Quiet down, people!
My name is Mr. Abagnale!
That's Abagnale, not Abagnahlee
not Abagnaylee, but Abagnale!
Now, somebody please tell me
where you left off
in your textbooks.
Excuse me, people,
if I need to ask again
I'm going to write up
the entire class.
Take your seats!
Chapter seven.
Will you please open your
textbooks to, uh, chapter eight
and we'll get started?
Excuse me,
what's your name?
Brad.
Brad, why don't you get up here
in front of the class here
and read conversation
number five?
:
-
They sent for me.
They said they needed a sub
for Roberta.
I came all the way
from-from Dixon.
Well, uh,
I always sub for Roberta.
Excuse me,
why aren't you reading?
I'll never come back to-to
Bellarmine Jefferson again!
- You tell them not to call me!
-
What do they think,
it's easy for a woman my age
and all the money that it costs
to travel?
I tell you,
they don't give a damn.
Mr. And Mrs. Abagnale
this is not a question
of your son's attendance.
I regret to inform you that,
for the past week
Frank has been teaching
Mrs. Glasser's French class.
He what?
Your son has been pretending
to be a substitute teacher
lecturing the students,
uh, giving out homework.
Mrs. Glasser has been ill
and there was
some confusion
with the real sub.
Your son held a teacher-parent
conference yesterday
and was planning
a class field trip
to a French bread factory
in Trenton.
Do you see the problem we have?
- Mrs. Davenport?
- Yeah.
Uh, I have a note to miss fifth
and sixth period today.
Doctor's appointment.
- One moment.
-
I'll be right with you.
:
Hey...
MRS. DAVENPORT:
Yes?
You should fold it.
What?
That note. It's a fake, right?
You should fold it.
It's... It's a note from my mom.
I have a doctor's appointment.
Yeah, but there's no crease
in the paper.
When your mom hands you a note
to miss school
the first thing you do is,
you fold it
and you put it in your pocket.
I mean, if it's real,
where's the crease?
-
-
:
Frankie.
Ma, I'm home.
Oh, you remember
that girl Joanna
I was telling you about?
I asked her out today.
Think we're going to go
to the Junior Prom.
Ma, is this
my driver's license?
That's all there is,
two bedrooms.
Oh, Frankie.
You remember Dad's friend?
Jack Barnes?
From the club.
Hello.
He came by looking
for your father.
I was giving him
a tour of the apartment.
It's very, uh, uh,
spacious, Paula.
Dad's at the store.
So, Frank...
you're getting to look
more like your old man
every day.
Thanks for the sandwich, Paula.
I'll see you later, eh?
Wait.
Is this yours?
Oh.
Well, thanks, Frank.
Uh, that's the President's pin.
I'd be in deep trouble
if I lost that.
I'll see you all later, eh?
Are you hungry, Frankie?
I'll make you a sandwich.
Jack wanted to talk business
with your father.
He thinks we should get a lawyer
and sue the government.
That is not legal,
what they're doing to us.
Why aren't you saying anything?
You're not going to tell him...
are you?
:
No.
That's right.
There's nothing to tell.
I'm going out for a few hours
to visit some old friends
from the tennis club and...
when I get home,
we'll all have dinner together.
Right?
But you won't say anything
because it's...
it's just silly, isn't it?
How could we sue anybody?
Oh... do you need
some money, Frankie?
A few dollars to buy
some record albums?
Here, take five dollars.
Or-Or ten.
You promised you were going
to quit.
Ma, I'm home!
Hey, hey!
You... You stay away from me,
hear me?
You stay away from me...
I don't know who you are
but if you ever
come back here again...
Frankie! Frank, Frank,
calm down, will you?
I'm Dick Kesner.
Now, I want you
to leave your things here
and follow me
into the next room, okay?
They're all waiting for you.
PAULA:
You don't have to be scared.
I'm right here, Frank.
I'll always be here.
But there are laws.
Everything in this country has
to be legal.
So what we need to do is
make some decisions.
That's what Mr. Kesner
is here for.
Many times these decisions
are left up to the courts
but that can be
very expensive, Frank
people fighting
over their children.
Nobody is fighting.
Look at me, Frank.
Nobody is fighting.
:
Dad, what's going on?
Dad, what's going on?
Do you remember your grandma,
Eve?
She arrived this morning.
Hello.
Do you understand what
we're saying to you, Frank?
Your father and I
are getting a divorce.
Nothing's gonna change.
We're still gonna see
each other.
Stop it, please, Frank.
Don't interrupt.
Frank, you don't
have to read all of this.
Most of it's for your parents...
boring adult business...
but this paragraph right here,
this is important
because it states
who you're gonna live with...
after the divorce...
whose custody you will be in.
And there's a blank space
right here.
And I want you to go
into the kitchen
sit at the table
and put a name down.
You can take
as long as you want
but when you come back
into this room...
Frank, just write down a name
and this will all be over.
It's gonna be okay.
FRANK:
Your mother or your father.
Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.
And don't look so scared.
It's not a test.
Hi.
One ticket to Grand Central,
please.
That'll be $3.50, sir.
Is it okay
if I write you a check?
Carl, when do I get
to call my father?
You can call him
when we get to New York.
We leave for the airport
in seven hours.
Paris, France 1969
Until then, just sit there.
Be quiet.
You know, Carl,
on the other side of the hotel
they got suites
that face the park.
It's the best room
the FBI can afford.
It's okay, I've stayed in worse.
Mr. Mudrick, please.
You have to listen.
I don't want to hear your story.
This is two checks that bounced.
You know how much trouble
I'm in?
No, but listen, I'm telling you,
the bank, they made the mistake.
I'll write you another check
right now!
What, do I look like
I was born yesterday?
Look, it's midnight,
Mr. Mudrick.
Where am I gonna go?
You're a goddamn kid.
Go home.
I mean, I hope you understand.
My boss sent me to Brooklyn,
then Queens.
Now he wants me in Long Island
to take a few clients out
for a night on the town.
I'm sorry, but we're not allowed
to cash checks from other banks.
How would we know
if they were any good?
What did you say your name was?
Ashley.
Ashley... you know what I found
on the sidewalk out there?
Must've slipped
right off your neck.
Is there something
I can help you with, son?
Well, you see, it's my
grandmother's birthday next week
and I want to get her
something extra-special.
it's my midterm next week
and my books were stolen.
Please, it's just five dollars.
No one would have to know.
I'm sorry,
but we are not allowed
to take checks
from people we don't know.
Pleasure to have you back,
Captain Carlson.
What do you think, Angelo?
The tomatoes are ripe
this afternoon.
Well, what have we here?
- Can I have your autograph?
- You betcha.
- Can I have your autograph, too?
- You gonna be a pilot?
- Mm-hmm!
- All right, then.
There you go.
Work hard in school.
FRANK:
Hello.
I'm Frank Black
from Murrow High School
and I have an appointment
with Mr. Morgan.
You're the young man
who's writing the article
for the school paper.
Yes, ma'am, that's me.
I want to know
everything there is to know
about being a pilot.
What airports
does Pan Am fly to?
What does a pilot make
in a year?
And who tells them
where they're gonna fly to?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.
Just take 'em one at a time.
All right. What does it mean
when one pilot says
to another pilot:
"What kind of equipment
are you on?"
They just want to know what kind
of aircraft you're flying:
Is it a DC-8, 707,
Constellation?
And what about those I.D. Badges
that I've seen pilots wear?
Well, every pilot has to have
two things with him
at all times: One is
his airline personnel badge...
looks just like this one here,
from Pan Am...
the other one is
their FAA license...
and that looks just like this.
Oh. Sir, do you think I can
make a copy of this
to put into my article?
Oh, Frank,
you can have that one.
It's three years expired.
Aw, thanks!
And what about your I.D. Badge?
You have an extra one
I could borrow?
Oh, no, I can't help you there.
Those are special-ordered
from Polaroid.
The only way
to get one of those
is to become a real live pilot
for Pan American Airways.
WOMAN :
Pan Am, may I help you?
FRANK :
Yeah, hello.
I'm calling about a uniform.
WOMAN:
Hold for Purchasing.
FRANK:
Thank you.
WOMAN 2:
Purchasing.
FRANK :
Hi. I'm a copilot
based out of San Francisco.
I flew a flight
into New York last night
but the problem is
I'm headed out to, uh, Paris
in three hours.
WOMAN 2:
How can we help you?
FRANK:
I sent my uniform
to be cleaned through the hotel
and I... I guess
they must have lost it.
WOMAN 2:
ROSEN:
You look too young
to be a pilot.
I'm a copilot.
Why so nervous?
How would you feel if you, uh
lost your uniform
first week on the job?
Relax.
Pan Am's got lots of uniforms.
It's gonna be $164.
Great. I'II, uh,
I'll write you a check.
Sorry, no checks, no cash.
You'll have to fill in
your employee I.D. Number
and then I'll bill Pan Am.
They'll take it out
of your next paycheck.
Even better.
FRANK:
GIRL:
Are you a real live pilot?
I sure am, little lady.
What's your name?
Celine.
Celine, it's a pleasure
to meet you.
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.
That's fifty, seventy
eighty, ninety,
one hundred dollars.
You have yourself a great time
in Paris.
I always do.
Excuse me.
I'm John Modiger.
I manage this branch.
I want to thank you
for coming in
and using our institution.
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, John.
I'll be back again.
Good.
Have you stayed with us before?
Uh, no, I've been primarily
based on the West Coast.
Is it all right if I write you
a check for the room?
No problem, sir.
Great.
Uh...
I was also wondering
if I could write you
a personal check?
For airline personnel, we cash
personal checks up to $100.
Payroll checks
we cash up to $300.
Did you say $300
for a payroll check?
FRANK:
not take her to the Junior Prom.
Hello, how are you?
Fine, thank you.
I have a payroll check here
I'd like to cash.
Certainly.
Thank you.
Uh, excuse me.
I'm sure you hear this
all the time
but you have the most
beautiful eyes I have ever seen.
Yeah, I do get that
all the time.
How would you like it?
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
We won't have any cash until
the banks open in an hour
but, uh, I'm sure
they can cash your check
at the airport.
The airport?
Who cashes checks
at the airport?
Well, the airlines, sir.
They've always taken care
of their own.
Hello.
Hi. Are you deadheading?
What?
Are you my deadhead to Miami?
Mi...?
Yes, yes.
Yeah, I'm the deadhead.
Here you go.
You're a little late,
but the jump seat is open.
:
You know
it's been awhile
since I've done this.
Which one's the jump seat again?
Have a nice flight.
Are you my deadhead?
STEWARDESS:
Frank, Captain Oliver.
- John Larkin, the copilot.
- Hello.
Fred Tulley, flight engineer.
Frank Taylor, Pan Am.
Thanks for giving me a lift,
boys.
Go ahead and take a seat, Frank.
We're about to push.
What kind of equipment you on,
DC-8?
Uh, 707.
You turning around
on the redeye?
Uh, I'm jumping puddles
for the next few months
trying to earn my keep
running leapfrogs
for the weak and weary.
No shame in that.
We all did it.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
Would you like a drink
after takeoff?
M-Milk?
OLIVER:
LARKIN:
Check.
V-one. Rotate.
V-two. Positive rate.
Gear up.
FRANK:
Hello, deadhead.
Hello.
Enjoying your free ride?
Marci...
did you drop this?
Must've slipped
right off your neck.
No...
:
No!
No...
MARCl:
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Yes!
Why are you stopping?
I want to tell you something,
Marci.
This is by far...
the best date I have ever
been on.
WOMAN:
I'd like to open a Money Market,
please.
Okay.
Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank.
How may I help you?
My name is Frank Taylor.
I'm a copilot for Pan Am.
I'd like to cash
this check here, and then
I'd like to take you out
for a steak dinner.
And then we feed the checks
into the MICR machine
which uses special ink
to encode the account numbers
on the bottom of the checks.
And where are these numbers?
They're, um... right here.
Right there?
See?
They're called routing numbers.
So where do the checks
get routed to?
You know, I don't exactly know.
Nobody ever
asked me that before.
AUCTIONEER:
Our next item up for bid
is also from the Jersey
Central Bank foreclosure.
This is a MICR encoder
a machine used
to encode bank checks.
Do I have an opening bid?
HANRATTY:
What he's doing is
he's opening checking accounts
at various banks
then changing the MICR ink
routing numbers
at the bottom of those checks.
Next slide, please.
Next slide, please.
Uh, the remote thing is broken.
You'll have to do it by hand.
You've gotta... try the...
FBI Headquarters
Washington, D.C.
Agent Mullen, it should be...
it should be the square button
just there by the side.
This carousel doesn't work.
It's a bad carousel
you got there.
Thank you, Agent Mullen.
Got to move it manually.
This is a map of the 12 banks
of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Slide.
MICR scanners at every bank
read these numbers
at the bottom of a check...
slide...
and then, ship that check off
to its corresponding branch.
Carl, for those of us who are
unfamiliar with bank fraud
you mind telling us
what the hell
you're talking about?
The East Coast branches are
numbered zero-one to zero-six.
The central branch
is zero-seven, zero-eight
so on, so forth.
You mean those numbers
on the bottom of a check
actually mean something?
All of this was in the report
I filed two days ago.
If you change...
a zero-two to a one-two
that means that check,
which was cashed in New York
does not go
to the New York Federal Branch
but it is rerouted
all the way to the San Francisco
Federal Branch.
The bank doesn't even know the
check has bounced for two weeks
which means our unsub can stay
in one place
paper the same city
over and over again
while his checks circle
the country.
You know,
you want to talk to my wife.
She's the one balances
the checkbook at our house.
Next slide.
Daddy!
My son, the birdman.
Some uniform, Frank.
What do you think?
Nice.
Sit down.
So, Dad... Daddy, have you
gotten the postcards?
Of course.
This fork is ice cold.
No, no, Dad, th-that's
a chilled salad fork.
:
It's a fancy restaurant,
you know.
Well, here...
l-I got you something.
What's that?
Open it.
You know what those are, right?
Those are the keys
to a 1965 Cadillac
DeVille convertible.
Brand-new, Dad.
Red with white interior
split seats,
air conditioning, the works.
Are you giving me a Cadillac?
Yeah. I'm giving you a Cadillac.
Dad, sh-she's parked downstairs.
When we're done eating lunch
why don't you, you know,
drive on over to Mom's house
pick her up,
take a little joyride?
Do you know what would happen
if the IRS found out
I was driving around
in a new coupe?
I took the train here, Frank.
I'm taking the train home.
All right.
I have plenty of money.
You know, if you
ever, ever need anything...
You worried?
About me?
No, I'm not... I'm not worried.
You think I can't buy
my own car?
Two mice fell
in a bucket of cream, Frank.
Which one am I?
You're that second mouse.
I went by the store today.
I had to close the store
for awhile.
It's all about timing, Frank.
The goddamn government
knows that.
They hit you when you're down.
I wasn't going to let them
take it from me, so I just...
shut the doors myself,
called their bluff.
Sooner or later,
they'll forget about me.
I understand, I...
Have you told Ma?
She's so stubborn, your mother.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.
I been fighting for us...
Dad?
...since the day we... we met.
Daddy, out of all those men
you were the one that
took her home, remember that.
that tiny social hall
watching her dance.
What was the name of that town?
Montrichard, Dad.
Yeah.
I didn't speak a word of French
and six weeks later,
she was my wi...
She's your wife.
My son bought me
a Cadillac today.
I think that calls for a toast.
To the best damn pilot
in the sky.
It's not what you think.
I'm just a copilot.
You see these people staring
at you?
These are
the most powerful people
in New York City
and they keep peeking
over their shoulders
wondering where
you're going tonight.
Where you going, Frank?
Dad, nobody's staring at me.
Some place exotic?
Just tell me where you're going.
Los An... Hollywood.
Hollywood.
:
The rest of us...
really are suckers.
So, I got on this red dress
and these high heels, right?
And I got a bra,
like, out here, okay?
And I'm chasing
these two Puerto Rican guys
through the park.
Hollywood California
They got a suitcase filled
with bank robbery loot.
Okay, I'm screaming out,
"FBI, freeze!"
And I'm reaching for my gun,
but I can't find it in the bra.
It's so damn big
I thought I was going
to shoot my tits off.
You know, that's a funny story.
People always laugh
at that story.
Let me ask you a question,
Mr. Amdursky.
If you were having
so much fun undercover
why did you transfer
to bank fraud?
I didn't transfer.
I was censured
and reassigned.
It's like being punished.
I was punished.
I screwed up in the field.
What about you, Mr. Fox?
Were you... punished
for screwing up in the field?
Oh, no, no, no, I've never
worked in the field before.
I audited
background investigations
of Department of Justice
clerical applicants.
Well, that's just great.
I ask for a team
and they drag the bottom
of the Pacific.
You mind if I ask you
a question, Agent Hanratty?
How come you're so serious
all the time?
Does it bother you,
Mr. Amdursky?
Yeah. Yeah, it does bother me.
Does it bother you, Mr. Fox?
A little, I guess.
Well, would you like
to hear me tell a joke?
Yeah. Yeah, we'd love
to hear a joke from you.
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
Go fuck yourselves.
Tall and tan
and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema...
MAN:
I don't want any trouble.
No trouble.
No trouble at all.
We'll just take this check
and be on our way.
Thank you.
Good.
Because I don't want
my customers harassed.
...Each one she passes
goes ahh...
What are you saying,
he's still here?
...Oh, but he watches
so sadly...
Thank you.
Corner here.
Oh, thanks, son.
...How can he tell her
he loves her...
Some steps.
Steps.
Hey, Mr. Murphy, how are you?
Is that Frank?
Yeah, it's Frank.
Hey, Frank, how are you?
How's the knee?
Come on,
I'll race you right now.
:
Take care.
Okay, Frank.
AMDURSKY:
"Eyeball the back"?
Come on, Carl,
this guy's a pen and ink man.
A goddamn paperhanger.
He doesn't even carry a gun.
Why can't we go with you, Carl?
You just keep your eyes open,
do your job
and I'll buy you both
a Good Humor bar.
It's all right, ma'am. FBI.
FBI!
FBI!
Come out of the bathroom!
Step out of the bathroom!
Hands on your head.
Oh, that's the new
IBM Selectric.
Put your hands on your head.
You can change the print type
in five seconds.
- Shut up!
- Just pop out the ball.
Put your hands on your head!
Put your hands...!
You know, he's got over 200
checks here, a gallon
- of India ink, drafting.
- Hands on your head!
Even has
little payroll envelopes
addressed to himself
from Pan Am.
Put it down! Drop it!
Relax.
You're late, all right?
My name's Allen, Barry Allen
United States Secret Service.
Your boy just tried
to jump out the window.
My partner has him
in custody downstairs.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
You think the FBI
are the only ones on this guy?
I mean, come on.
Come on, he's dabbling
in government checks here.
We've been following
a paper trail on this guy
for months now.
Hey, you mind taking that gun
out of my face?
Please. Really.
I mean, it makes me nervous.
Let me see some credentials.
Yeah, sure.
Take my whole wallet.
You want my gun, too?
Come over here. Take my gun.
Hey, hey, look,
just do me a favor.
Take a look outside. Look.
Look out the window.
My partner's walking him
to the car as we speak... Look.
Old guy almost pissed
in his pants
when I came through the door.
He jumped
right through the window
onto the hood of my car.
Hey, Murph?
- Yeah?
- Call the LAPD again.
I don't want people walking
through my crime scene.
I didn't expect
the Secret Service on this.
Don't worry about it.
Well, what's your name?
Hanratty, Carl Hanratty.
Mind if I see
some identification?
Sure.
You never can be too careful
these days.
Well, tough luck, Carl.
Five minutes earlier
you would've landed yourself
a pretty good collar.
It's all right.
Ten seconds later,
and you'd have been shot.
Mind if I come downstairs
with you?
L-I got to take a look
at this guy.
Sure thing.
Just, uh, do me a favor
and sit tight for a second
while I get
this evidence downstairs.
You know, I don't want
some maid walking through here
and making the bed.
LAPD should be here any sec.
Wait.
Your wallet.
You hang onto it for a minute.
I trust you.
Oh...
Yeah...
Secret Service.
Hey!
Oh, goddamn it!
It was stupid.
I made a stupid mistake.
Forget about it.
There are hundreds
of unknown subjects out there.
L-I can get this guy, Sean.
The worst thing a paperhanger
can do is show his face.
I read the report.
Six feet tall, brown hair,
This could be almost anybody.
I heard his voice, Sean,
I saw his face.
There's nothing for him
to hide behind anymore.
Just be careful.
You got 12 years in.
Nobody bothers you
down on the first floor.
You practically wrote the book
on bank fraud.
That's the kind of thing
that can make you
section chief someday.
Just don't put yourself
in this type of position.
What type of position?
Position of being humiliated.
Sean, would you like
to hear me tell a joke?
Yeah, sure.
:
Knock, knock!
FRANK:
So, my-my next question is,
when a pilot retires
uh, Pan Am sends them
a check every single month?
Uh, yeah, pension program
sends a check and benefits.
How much is that check for?
Uh, kid, I'm really not
in the mood for this right now.
This Skywayman's
driving me crazy.
Who's the Skywayman?
Ah, some nut that's flying
around the country
posing as a Pan Am pilot.
There's a column about him
in the paper today.
I keep telling them
this is not my problem.
This guy
doesn't even fly Pan Am.
Flies everybody else.
Flies United, TWA,
Continental, Eastern...
:
The Skywayman.
Newspaper loves this clown.
They call him
"the James Bond of the sky."
Did you say...?
Bond, James Bond.
BOND:
Tell me, Joan,
why does he do it?
WOMAN:
He likes to win.
MAN:
Come on, come on.
WOMAN:
We'll be landing
in 20 minutes.
Do you want to play it easy
or the hard way?
And this isn't a tranquilizer.
Well, Pussy, you do know a lot
more about planes than guns.
:
Hello, Pussy.
:
Now, you're sure
this is the suit, right?
Positive.
It's the exact suit he wore
in the movie.
:
Okay. I'll take three.
Certainly, Mr. Fleming.
Now what you need is
one of those
little foreign sports cars
that he drives.
The look of love
Is in your eyes...
Hello.
Hi.
...The look your heart...
Haven't I seen you before?
...Can't disguise...
Maybe.
A couple years ago, I was
on the cover of
Yeah.
You're that model, right?
Cheryl.
Yes.
The guys used to put
your picture on their lockers.
Isn't that your silver car
I saw parked out front?
Yeah. One of them.
Well, it takes
my breath away...
So, think I could get
an autograph?
...I can hardly wait
to hold you
Feel my arms around you...
Do you have a pen in your room?
...How long I have waited...
You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time
can't erase...
Shh.
...Be mine tonight...
Man like you can buy
anything he wants.
...Let this be
just the start
Of so many nights
like this...
He buys a deck of cards
at the hotel gift shop.
...And then seal it
with a kiss...
Well, you want
to see a card trick?
...I can hardly wait
to hold you...
How much did these cards cost?
...Feel my arms
around you...
Oh, 55 cents, I think.
...Waited just
to love you...
And if they sold me downstairs
at the hotel gift shop...
how much would you pay?
I'm sor...
I'm sorry, how mu...
how much would I pay for what?
The entire night.
How much would you pay me
for the entire night?
Cheryl, I...
I really don't know.
...I can hardly wait
to hold you...
Don't be scared.
...How long I have waited...
Make me an offer.
...Now that I have found you
Don't ever go...
$300?
Go fish.
Uh, $500?
Go fish.
$600.
Go fish.
$1,000.
Okay.
$1,000.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
Wait a second.
Where are you going?
I'm going downstairs
to cash a check.
You think this hotel is going
to cash a $1,000 check
at 3:00am?
It's a New York Savings and Loan
check.
It's like gold.
They'll cash it.
Don't you think they might get
a little suspicious?
Let me see that.
It's a cashier's check.
Endorse it over to me.
No. I couldn't do that.
See, this check is for $1,400.
We agreed upon $1,000.
Why don't I give you back $400
and you give me that check?
Even better.
The look of love
Is in your eyes...
Does this belong to anybody?
Mele Kalikimaka
is the thing to say...
On a bright
Hawaiian Christmas Day...
This is Hanratty.
Merry Christmas.
FRANK:
Hello, Carl.
Hello.
...That we send to you,
from the land...
Barry Allen, Secret Service.
I've been trying
to track you down now
for the last couple of hours.
What do you want?
I wanted to apologize
for what happened
out in Los Angeles.
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
No, no,
you don't apologize to me.
Do you always work
on Christmas Eve, Carl?
I volunteered
so men with families
could go home early.
Looked like you were wearing
a wedding ring
out in Los Angeles.
I thought maybe
you had a family.
No. No family.
You want to talk to me...
let's talk face-to-face.
All right.
I'm at my suite at the
Stuyvesant Arms, room 3113.
In the morning, I leave
for Las Vegas for the weekend.
You think you're going
to get me again?
You're not going to Vegas.
You're not
in the Stuyvesant Arms.
You'd love for me
to send out 20 agents
Christmas Eve
we barge into your hotel,
knock down the door
so you can make fools
out of us all.
I'm really sorry
if I made a fool out of you.
I really am.
Uh-uh, no.
No, listen, I really am.
No, no, you-you do not
feel sorry for me.
The truth is,
I knew it was you.
Now maybe I didn't get the cuffs
on you, but I knew.
Ah, people only know
what you tell them, Carl.
Well, then tell me this,
Barry Allen, Secret Service.
How did you know
I wouldn't look in your wallet?
The same reason
the Yankees always win.
Nobody can keep their eyes
off the pinstripes.
The Yankees win
because they have Mickey Mantle.
No one ever bets on the uniform.
You sure about that, Carl?
I'll tell you what I  sure of.
You're going to get caught.
One way or another,
it's a mathematical fact.
It's-It's like Vegas.
The House always wins.
Well, Carl, I'm sorry,
but I have to go.
Ah. You didn't call
just to apologize, did you?
What do you mean?
You... you...
you have no one else to call.
Oh, ho, ho.
...Morn and night...
You got that burger up?
Yep.
- Hi.
- Hi!
How are you?
...Doo-lang, doo-lang,
doo-lang...
The one
with the wavy hair...
More coffee, sir?
Are you a collector?
Of what?
"Captives of the Cosmic Ray,"
"The Big Freeze"
"Land of the Golden Giants."
I've got them all.
What are you talking about?
Barry Allen.
The Flash.
Wait, kid, kid, kid.
You mean like the comic book?
Yeah, the comic book.
When he's not The Flash.
That's his name, Barry Allen.
Thank you.
Now get this:
He reads comic books.
Comic books!
Barry Allen is The Flash!
FOX:
Carl, slow down. Slow down.
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.
He's a kid.
Our unsub is a kid.
That's why we couldn't match
his prints.
That's why he doesn't have
a record.
Now, I want you to contact NYPD
for every all-points juvenile
runaways in New York City.
And don't forget the airports.
He's been kiting checks
all over the country.
But why New York?
The Yankees!
He said something
about the Yankees!
HANRATTY:
So where are we on the list?
FOX:
Number 53, "Abagnahlee."
HANRATTY:
Good morning, ma'am.
We're the FBI agents
who called.
Yes, I've been waiting.
I hope you're all hungry.
I put out the Sara Lee.
My husband Jack is a lawyer.
What about your first husband,
Mrs. "Abagnahlee"?
Abagnale, but I prefer
to be called Barnes.
"Frank William Abagnale."
It says here
he was in the service.
Did... Did you two meet
during the war?
Yeah, I lived
in a very small village
in France... Montrichard...
the kind of place
where they never heard
of Sara Lee.
Help yourselves.
"Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee."
You filled out
a missing person's report
for a runaway juvenile by
the name of Frank Abagnale Jr.
Is Frankie okay?
You're aware of the fact
that he wrote some checks
on a closed account
at Chase Manhattan Bank?
Oh, yes.
The police think
he's some type of criminal.
What he did was a felony,
Mrs. Barnes.
It was $1,000.
Half the kids his age are
on dope
throwing rocks at police
and they scared me to death
because my son made
a little mistake.
Huh. A 17-year-old...
boy has to eat
has to have a place to sleep.
We understand, ma'am.
Would you happen to have
a picture of your son?
Oh, yes.
I have his old yearbook.
Okay.
Okay, okay, we, uh...
we need to send out
an all-office teletype.
Our unsub's name is
Frank Abagnale Jr., age 17.
Is Frankie okay?
Is he in trouble?
Ma'am, I'm sorry
to have to tell you:
Your son is forging checks.
Forging checks? Wait!
I'm sure we can take care
of that.
I am working part-time
at the church now.
Just tell me how much he owes
and I'll pay you back.
So far, it's about $1.3 million.
Girl, you really
got me goin'
You got me so
I don't know what I'm doin'
Riverbend Apartments
Atlanta, Georgia
Yeah, you really
got me goin'
You got me
so I can't sleep at night...
Hi, Melanie, how are you?
When you're in the house,
please, just use an ashtray.
Frank, this fondue is so good!
Great. Here, take this for me.
Ooh, good! I love Moet!
Oh, yeah...
Hey. How are you?
You really got me goin'
You got me goin',
got me goin' and goin'...
James, James, please!
Just stay away from the
hi-fi system, all right?
It's reel-to-reel.
You can't wind it like that.
Don't ever set me free...
Christ! Terry!
This is Italian knit!
Watch where you're going!
It's just a shirt, man!
Frank! Come quick!
Lance just fell
into the conversation pit!
Excuse me, you know
where Lance Applebaum is?
Thank you.
DOCTOR:
These bottles need to be labeled
when you pick them up.
Do you understand
how dangerous this is?
Do you?
Don't stand there crying,
just nod your head
and tell me
you won't do it again.
Now dry up and get back to work.
WOMAN :
Dr. Blair, Dr. Blair
Dr. Sherwood Blair.
:
Hey, hey... you okay?
:
He told me to pick up the blood,
so I did, but he never told me
to label it.
Hey, it's okay.
Stop crying.
What's your name?
- Brenda.
- Brenda.
Brenda, I wouldn't worry
about it.
You know, these doctors
you know,
they don't know everything.
It's my first week
and I think they're
going to fire me.
No, no, nobody's
going to fire you, Brenda.
I bet you're good at your job.
No, I'm not.
Yeah, I bet if I asked you
to check on the status
of my friend Lance Applebaum
that you could do that for me
in a second.
WOMAN :
Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery.
Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery.
Um...
Mr. Applebaum fractured
his ankle.
Dr. Ashland is treating him
in exam room seven.
You see that? No problem.
This is the emergency chart.
See that blue star there?
That means that the patient
has been diagnosed.
And then,
after he's been treated
we put a red circle here, see?
How do you like those braces?
I guess they're all right.
I got mine off last year.
Boy, I hated them.
They were bottoms.
You know, I still got to wear
my mouth guard.
You have really nice teeth.
Well, thank you.
And you have a pretty smile.
WOMAN :
Custodial to cafeteria.
No, I mean it.
I really think
those braces look good on you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Brenda.
Yeah.
Do you know if they're hiring
here at the hospital?
I'm not sure.
What do you want to do?
I'm a doctor.
FRANK:
Harvard Medical School...
top of your class.
Southern California
Children's Hospital.
Well, that's a pretty impressive
resume, Dr. Conners
but unfortunately, uh...
the only thing I need
is a...
an emergency room supervisor
for my midnight to 8:00am shift
someone to baby-sit
six interns and 20 nurses
but, uh...
Hell, I doubt that, uh,
you would be interested in that.
Well, in the past
they've always let me choose
my own nurses.
Dr. Connelly?
Dr. Harris?
Present.
Dr. Ashland?
Dr. Conners...
You gonna take roll every night?
Uh, yes, I will, Dr. Ashland
and if you're going to be late,
I suggest you bring a note.
Miss Basmann.
Miss Mace.
Miss Strong.
Here.
Nurse Brown.
- Nurse Sanford?
- Here.
SURGEON :
every four hours.
Run the plasma
at 60 drops a minute
until we calculate
the fluid requirements.
What do you estimate
the degree and extent
of the burns, Kildare?
DR. KILDARE:
Second and third-degree burns
over about 20 percent
of the body surface.
Do you concur?
I concur.
Let's get him up to Pediatrics.
WOMAN :
Nurse Hopp
to the Nurses' Station South.
Nurse Hopp
to the Nurses' Station South.
Hello, Brenda.
Hi, Dr. Conners.
You need to sign these.
Thank you.
Do you notice anything
different about me, Doctor?
- You got your braces off!
- Yeah!
Come here. Let me see.
I've been trying
to show you all night!
Wow. Good job.
Yeah?
So, did it hurt
when they took them off?
Mine felt so weird after.
Mm, I keep rubbing my tongue
over them.
I can't stop.
They're so slippery.
It feels good, though,
doesn't it?
Yeah, it feels incredible.
Oh, my.
I'm... I'm sorry.
WOMAN :
Dr. Conners to the ER.
Dr. Conners to the ER.
Shouldn't you go?
No. No, no.
They have a staff doctor
in the emergency ward.
We'll be fine.
:
What if he's in surgery?
Do you really think
I have to go?
Oh. In here, Dr. Conners.
Gentlemen, what, uh...
what seems to be the problem?
Bicycle accident.
Fractured tibia about
five inches below the patella.
Hmm.
- Dr. Harris.
- Yes?
Do you concur?
C... Concur with what, sir?
With what Dr. Ashland just said.
Do you... Do you concur?
Uh... well, it was
a bicycle accident.
Um, the boy told us.
So you concur?
Concur? Uh...
I think we should take an X ray
then stitch him up
and put him in a walking cast.
That's very good, Dr. Ashland.
Very good.
Well, you don't seem
to have much need for me.
Carry on.
I blew it, didn't I?
Why didn't I concur?
WOMAN :
Dr. Henning, call extension 219.
Dr. Henning, extension 219.
FRANK SR:
Make yourself at home!
Frank Abagnale Sr.
You're not a cop.
Special Agent Hanratty, FBI.
You're not a cop.
My landlord said
you were not a cop.
Well, if you're going
to arrest me
I'd like
to put on a different suit
if that's okay with you.
No, no, I'm not here
to arrest you.
I'm looking for your son.
He's in trouble.
Do you know where he is?
If I tell you where he is
will you promise
not to tell his mother?
Sure.
Frank made up a fake I.D.
And enlisted
in the Marine Corps.
He's over in Vietnam right now.
That kid is halfway
around the world
crawling through the damn jungle
fighting the Communists, so...
Please, don't come to my home
and call my boy a criminal
because that kid has
more guts...
I never said he was a criminal,
Mr. Abagnale.
I said he was in trouble.
If you'd like to give me a call
and talk, here's my number.
You're not a father, are you?
Pardon me?
If you were a father,
you'd know.
I would never give up my son.
I would never give up my son.
Yes, sir. I understand.
Sean, Sean, now get this:
"Riverbend Apartments
Atlanta, Georgia.
Yeah, I'm on my way
to the airport.
I'll meet the team in, uh,
in four hours.
Bye-bye.
Come on, it's okay.
You don't have to cry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Frank.
I can't do this.
Brenda, listen to me.
I don't care if you're
a virgin, all right?
Really, I can wait.
I'm not a virgin.
I had an abortion two years ago.
My parents had a friend do it
a man that my father
plays golf with.
And then, when I got better,
they kicked me out of the house.
I had an abortion and I wasn't
their daughter anymore.
:
Hey...
I'm so sorry.
Please don't be mad at me.
Please, please,
don't be mad at me.
No, no.
Please don't be mad at me.
Shh. Now... what if...
what if I spoke
to your parents, right?
May-Maybe I can
straighten things out, huh?
Well, I ask them all the time
but they said I still
can't come home.
And my daddy's... a lawyer.
Aw...
Brenda...
what if you were engaged
to a doctor?
Will that change anything?
What?
What if I went
to your parents...
and I spoke to your father...
and I asked permission
to marry you?
It's empty.
Nobody here.
New Orleans
Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?
Yes, l-I am a Lutheran,
but, please, call me Frank.
Frank, would you like
to say grace?
Unless you're not comfortable.
Absolutely.
Two little mice fell
into a bucket of cream.
The first mouse quickly
gave up and drowned
but the second mouse,
he struggled so hard
that he eventually churned
that cream into butter
and he walked out.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Amen. Oh, that was beautiful.
The mouse, he churned
that cream into butter.
That's right.
That's pretty good.
Thank you.
Frank, have you decided
which hospital
you want to work at
here in New Orleans?
Well, um, to be quite honest
I'm thinking
about getting back into law.
Oh, my!
Are you a doctor or a lawyer?
Before I went to medical school,
I passed the bar in California.
I practiced law for one year
then I decided why not
try my hand at pediatrics?
You're just full of surprises.
Yeah.
MOTHER :
Oh, my.
A doctor and a lawyer.
Well, I'd say that Brenda
hit the jackpot.
Where did you go to law school?
Uh, Berkeley.
Berkley, Berkley. Oh, my gosh.
Isn't that where you went,
Daddy?
Maybe Frank could come work
for you, Roger.
You're always saying
how hard it is
to find
Assistant Prosecutors.
Could he, Daddy?
Could he, please?
Could he come work with you,
please?
Was that snake Hollingsworth
still teaching there
when you went through Berkley?
Hollingsworth.
Yes. Grumpy old Hollingsworth,
right?
I tell you. Meaner than ever.
And that dog of his?
Tell me, Frank, what was
the name of his little dog?
I'm sorry. Uh...
The dog was dead.
How unfortunate.
Yeah.
A doctor, a lawyer,
a Lutheran...
So what are you, Frank?
'Cause I think you're
about to ask
for my daughter's hand
in marriage
and I have a right to know.
Know what, sir?
The truth.
Tell me the truth, Frank.
What are you doing here?
What is a man like you doing
with Brenda?
If you want my blessing
if you want my daughter
I'd like to hear it
from you now.
The truth is, sir, that...
The truth is that...
I'm not a doctor,
I'm not a lawyer...
I'm not an airline pilot.
I'm... I'm nothing, really.
I'm-I'm-I'm just a kid who's
in love with your daughter.
No.
You know what you are?
You're a romantic.
Men like us are nothing
without the women we love.
I must confess, I'm guilty
of the same foolish whimsy.
I proposed to Carol
after five dates
with two nickels in my pockets
and holes in my shoes
because I knew she was the one.
So go ahead, Frank.
Don't be afraid.
Ask the question you came here
to ask me.
Sir, uh, uh...
w-what would I have to do
to take the bar
here in New Orleans?
No, the... the other question.
WOMAN:
Right through that door.
Good luck, Mr. Conners.
Thank you.
December 26, 1969
Hey, Frank...
you know what I could
never figure out?
How did you cheat on the
bar exam in Louisiana?
Why? What's the difference?
Someone else took the test
for you, didn't they?
Carl, I'm going to prison
for a long time.
Seriously,
what's the difference?
It's a simple question.
Are you going to eat
that eclair?
Yeah. I'm saving it for later.
Well, you want
to split it with me?
No.
Give me half that eclair
and I'll tell you.
I'm going to figure it out
sooner or later.
You'll be working under
Phillip Rigby in corporate law.
Why don't you settle in,
organize your desk?
Thank you.
We're having lunch at 12:30
with the Attorney General
and Governor McKeithen.
Himself.
The Governor.
Did we spell it right?
You sure did.
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.
Welcome aboard.
Now...
Look at this photograph,
Mr. Stewart.
It's a photograph
of Prentice York
where they found him, dead.
Now, here is an enlargement
of part of that photograph.
This is a photograph
of the defendant's signature
on a canceled check.
Now, here is an enlargement
of that same signature
which matches
the signature on the letters
that he wrote to Mrs. Simon
which discuss the possibility
of defrauding
the great State of Louisiana.
Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury
this is irrefutable evidence
that the defendant is,
in fact, lying.
Mr. Conners, this is
a preliminary hearing.
There is no... defendant.
There is no... jury.
It's just me.
Son...
what in the hell is wrong
with you?!
-
- Is that Mitch?
Roger! It's Mitch!
Oh, my,
I lost all track of time.
MITCH MILLER :

JUDY GARLAND :
Embrace me
My sweet embraceable you
Embrace me
You irreplaceable you
Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me
I love all
The many charms about you
Above all
I want my arms about you...
:
Dad.
...Don't be
a naughty baby...
What are you doing here?
I... l-I came to see you.
...My sweet embraceable...
What are you doing
dressed like this?
I took a job. A government job.
You see what I'm doing?
Do you have a good lawyer?
Well... I sort of
am a lawyer now.
Look at this letter.
The IRS wants more.
I had a deal with them:
Two penalties.
They ate the cake,
now they want the crumbs.
I want to sue them.
Now they want the crumbs.
They... Here, sit down.
They're trying to scare me,
intimidate me.
You know what?
You know what?
I'll make them chase me...
for the rest of their lives.
Hey, it's great
to see you, Daddy.
Listen, sit down, I...
I want to show you something.
I came here to give you this.
It's an invitation
to an engagement party.
Daddy, I'm getting married.
Can you believe that?
I'm getting married.
You don't need to worry
about anything now, Dad.
Listen, I'm getting
a brand-new Cadillac.
I'm getting a $60,000 house.
I'm-I'm getting it all back.
All-All the jewelry,
all the furs, everything, Dad.
Everything they took from us,
I'm going to get it back.
Now...
has Ma seen you
dressed like this?
Yeah, she came
to pick up some boxes.
That's okay, that's okay,
you know why?
'Cause she... she's going
to the wedding with us.
I'm going to get you
a brand-new suit, Dad.
I'm getting you
a brand-new suit.
One of those Manhattan Eagle,
three-button, black pearl suits.
You'll look great.
Those are nice. Yeah.
She won't see me.
Well, have you tried
to call her?
Uh-uh.
Why don't... why don't you
call her right now?
Dad, why don't you
call her right now? Here.
Dad, just call her.
Call her for me.
You call her, and you tell her
I have two first-class tickets
to go see her son's wedding...
Your mother's married now,
to my friend Jack Barnes.
They have a house
in Long Island.
:
I had an FBI agent come see me.
You got their number, son.
The guy looked scared.
The United States government,
champ, running for the hills.
Pow! To the moon!
Dad... it's over.
I'm going to stop now.
But y-you've...
They're never going
to catch you, Frank.
- Dad, she wouldn't do that.
- Why won't you sit down?
- Why would she do that to you?
- Come on, sit.
Come on, sit with me.
Have a drink.
I'm your father.
Then ask me to stop.
:
Then ask me to stop.
You can't stop.
Where are you going?
Come on, Frank,
where are you going?
Where are you going?
Where are you going tonight?
Someplace exotic?
Where are you going tonight?
Tahiti, Hawaii?
This is Hanratty.
FRANK:
Hello, Carl.
Merry Christmas.
How are you, Dr. Conners?
Carl, I haven't been Dr. Conners
for months now.
Well... I'm sitting here
in my office on Christmas Eve.
What do you want?
:
Okay.
I want it to be over.
Uh... I want it to be over.
I'm getting married.
You know, I'm settling down.
You've stolen almost $4 million.
You think we can just
call that a wedding present?
Nah, this isn't something you
get to walk away from, Frank.
I want to call a truce.
No truce.
You will be caught,
you will go to prison.
Where did you think
this was going?
Please leave me alone, Carl.
Please?
I'm getting close, aren't I?
You're scared because
I'm getting close.
I know you... you rented
that car in Shreveport
and you stayed in that hotel
on Lake Charles.
You want to run, be my guest.
Your checks don't lie
as well as you do.
Stop chasing me.
I can't stop.
It's my job.
It's okay, Carl.
I just thought I'd ask,
you know?
Hey. Merry Christmas, huh?
I love my job.
All right...
Let's get every newspaper
we can
every newspaper in Louisiana
for the last two months.
What are we looking for?
Engagement announcements,
name of Conners.
Conners?! Come on, Carl,
the kid would've
changed his name by now.
Mm-mm. He can't change it.
She thinks he's Conners.
If he loses the name,
he loses the girl.
I can't give you anything
But love, baby
That's the only thing
I have plenty of
Baby
Dreamin' a while,
schemin' a while...
- Congratulations.
- You having a good time?
...You're sure to find
- Happiness, and I guess
- Keep dancing, huh?
All those things
you've always pined for...
- Oh.
- Hi.
Oh, me too. Thank you.
I'm going to, uh,
the little boys' room.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Hurry back.
Good evening.
I'm Agent Hanratty
with the FBI.
We'd like to have
a few quiet words
with your host, if possible.
MAN:
I'll get him.
Right over there, sir.
- Hi, Roger. How are you?
- Hi, Vin.
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Roger Strong.
Carl Hanratty, FBI.
This is Agents Amdursky and Fox.
Sorry to crash your party, sir.
Not at all.
What can I do for you?
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to meet the groom.
Is there a problem?
-
- Frank! Frank!
Can you hold all these?
:
Yeah. Come here.
They're checks.
They're from my dad's friends.
They're for us, so we can
start a new life... Hey!
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
We have to leave.
What?!
Brenda, you love me, right?
Yes.
I mean, you'd love me
no matter what.
Yes.
I mean, you'd love me
whether I was sick
or whether I was poor
or even if I had
a different name.
Frank, where'd you get
all that money?
Brenda, listen. A name, right?
A name, it doesn't matter.
My name is Frank Conners, right?
- That's who I am with you.
- Yes.
But-but we all have secrets.
You know,
sometimes when I travel
I use the name Frank Taylor.
That-That's my secret.
- Frank Taylor?!
- Yeah, Frank Taylor, you know?
- Frank Black.
- Frank Black?!
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
Why are you saying all this?
Brenda... Brenda, I don't want
to lie to you anymore.
All right? I'm not a doctor.
I never went to medical school.
I'm not a lawyer or a Harvard
graduate or a Lutheran.
Brenda, I ran away from home
a year and a half ago
when I was 16.
Frank...
Frank?
You're not a Lutheran?
Brenda... you see
all this money?
You see all this money?
I have more.
I have plenty more.
I have enough money
to last us
for the rest of our lives
-
- Look.
Frank, stop teasing me.
You're Frank Conners.
You're Frank Conners,
and you're 28 years old and...
:
Brenda...
Why would you lie to me?
- Brenda, Brenda...
- I want to know your name.
- Listen to me, Brenda.
- Tell me your name.
We can live anywhere we want
but you have to trust me,
Brenda.
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.
- Do you love me, Brenda?
- Yes.
- You love me?
- I love you.
Excuse me, Mother.
Honey, this is Mr. Hanratty.
My wife Carol.
- Oh, Mister...?
- Hanratty, ma'am.
- Ratty.
- Yes.
Have you seen Frank or Brenda?
L-I think they went upstairs.
Frank...
:
Brenda, come here.
Okay, in two days,
you're going to meet me
at Miami International
Airport, all right?
You're going to leave the house
after your parents go to sleep.
You're going to take a taxicab.
You give the taxi driver
this money right here
and you tell him to drive
all through the night.
Brenda, you're going
to leave at 10:00am.
- 10:00am, all right?
- But...
I never stop
Till I get to the top...
Which room, sir?
In the corner.
You have to listen to me,
all right?
The International Terminal
in Miami, all right? Say it.
Okay, the International
Terminal in Miami.
- No matter what...
- No matter what...
- You're going to take a taxicab.
- I will take a taxi.
You're going to be there
at 10:00am.
I will be there at 10:00am,
no matter what.
- In two days.
- Two days.
Two days, Brenda. Two days.
In two days, I'll be there
no matter what, at 10:00am.
You're not going
to tell anyone, Brenda.
You have to promise me, now.
:
Frank, please!
Before you go,
please tell me your name.
Please, tell me.

HANRATTY:
If he's not here today,
he'll be tomorrow.
We'll get him before
he leaves the country.
He doesn't have a passport.
For the last six months, he's
gone to Harvard and Berkeley.
I'm betting he can get
a passport.
So we have all our men
waiting for him here
in Miami International.
He's used it before.
He knows the layout.
I talked to Miami police;
they've offered us
in two shifts of 25.
With our guys, that's almost
Don't you think
we should spread it around?
No, no, this is the exit point.
Well, how do you know
he hasn't rented a car
and driven to airports
in New York, Atlanta?
Because I'm not in New York.
I'm not in Atlanta.
Yes, this is, uh, Frank Roberts
and I'm letting
all the universities
in the area know
that Pan Am will be initiating
a new recruiting program
this year.
I'II, uh, be stopping
by your campus tomorrow morning.
Thank you all very much
for coming.
At the end of the day
I'll be choosing eight
young ladies to be a part of...
...Pan Am's future stewardess
flight crew program.
Now, these eight young ladies
will accompany me
on a two-month public relations
tour through Europe.
They will discover firsthand
what it takes
to be a Pan American stewardess.
HANRATTY:
Give me at least two men...
Nah, one man
per every two counters.
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?
Amdursky?
Yeah?
Make sure your uniforms
are covering
the sidewalk entrances
and exits.
Hey... let's have, uh, periodic
sweeps of the men's lav.
You, here.
What qualifies me
to be a future stewardess?
Well, I think
that I'm really friendly
and I can really help out
and, um, make people
feel welcome on the plane and...
We'll be traveling
at 6,000 miles per hour
at an altitude of 300 feet.
All my bags are packed,
I'm ready to go...

There's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me,
let's fly, let's fly away
Come fly with me,
let's float down to Peru
In Ilama land
there's a one-man band
And he'll toot his flute

Come fly with me...
Hi.
...Let's take off

Once I get you up there
Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide starry-eyed
Once I get you up there...
You see that blonde out front?
I should have been a pilot.
Exactly.
WOMAN :
Mr. Carl Hanratty
please pick up
the courtesy telephone.
Hanratty.
AMDURSKY:
Carl, your walkie-talkie
wasn't working.
There's a guy
in a Pan Am uniform
sitting in a white Coupe DeVille
out in front of Terminal J.
That's the charter terminal.
Can you get a look at his face?
He's got his pilot's cap on.
Carl, I think it's him!
...Just say the words,
and we'll beat the birds
Down to Acapulco Bay...
Watch out, watch out,
watch out!
...It's perfect for a flying
honeymoon, they say...
Out of the car, Frank.
Frank?!
Step out of the car!
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.
Don't shoot me!
I'm just a driver.
A man paid me $100
to wear this uniform
and pick someone up
at the airport.
Who you picking up?
Hey!
Pack up, let's fly away.
Seven months later
HANRATTY:
South America, Australia
Singapore, Egypt.
The kid's gone
completely out of control.
Why wasn't I called?
FOX:
Nobody was called, sir.
The banks didn't know what
was happening till last week.
That's impossible.
They didn't call
'cause it's not counterfeiting.
- It's something else.
- Well, what is he doing?
He's making real checks, sir.
These are so perfect
the airline didn't know
the difference.
Last check was cashed
in Madrid a week ago.
My guess is he's still there.
We have to leave now, sir.
Today.
Go where?
Spain? You want to go to Spain?
Well, eventually,
he's got to go back
to where the checks
were printed.
I think that's why
he's moving back through Europe.
Look at the map, sir.
He's making a circle.
He's running out of checks.
I know it's a...
it's a long shot, sir
but if we track him from Madrid,
sir, we could still catch him.
I'm sorry, Carl,
if you couldn't catch him here
you're not going
to catch him there.
But, sir, we're going
to let him get away.
No, Carl, you let him get away.
A perfect one-16th
all the way around.
Hmm!
Color separation is flawless.
There's no bleeding. Hmm.
Nobody does work like this
in the States.
Nobody but us.
HANRATTY:
Where was it printed?
:
It was printed on a monster...
A monster.
...a Heidelberg, an Istra...
Heidelberg.
...a dinosaur, four colors.
You can smell the weight.
Two tons, without the ink.
Where do they do printing
like this?
Germany, Great Britain...
France.
BOTH PRINTERS:
France!
France. Frank's mother said
the name of a village in France
where they didn't have Sara Lee.
The village where
she met Frank's father.
Oh, yeah,
I don't remember, uh...
It started with an M.
It was, uh, "Mont" something.
"Mont." Mr. Fox?
Uh, yes, yes.
Question: "You met your husband
during the war?"
Answer: "Yes, I lived
in a small village in France.
Yeah, right.
"The kind of place where
they never heard of Sara Lee."
Tell me you wrote down the name
of the village, Mr. Fox.
Montrichard.

Merry Christmas!
How is it that we're always
talking on Christmas, Carl?
Every Christmas
I'm talking to you!
Put your shirt on, Frank.
You're under arrest.
Hey, are you hungry?
Do you want some beans, Carl?
They got the best
French beans here.
Here, give these a try.
There's two dozen French
police officers outside.
Carl, I gotta tell you,
they're delicious.
They wanted to bring you in.
You want a bite?
But they needed the help
of an American.
Are you hungry?
You want a bite?
But I told them
I wouldn't bring them to you
unless I could put the cuffs
on you myself.
Well, you have a gun?
You have a gun?
- No gun?
- No.
No gun.
And-and you're...
and you're telling me what?
There's, uh,
there's uh...
There's two dozen
French police officers out there
right now on Christmas Eve?
That's what you're telling me?
Yeah.
:
All right, all right.
Well, there's no windows here.
I'm going to take a look
out the front door.
No! No!
I told them I'd walk out first
and give a signal.
Here, you can
put these on yourself.
No, I can't do that!
I can't do that.
You know why?
'Cause I think
you're full of shit.
I don't... I don't think
there's anyone else out there.
I think... I think
it's just me and you.
That's right.
I think it's just me and you,
and you know what?
You're going to have
to catch me yourself!
I wo... we don't have time
for this.
Ah, that's good. That's good.
Tell me what you want me to see,
huh?
I wouldn't lie to you.
Look, you're wearing
a wedding ring.
You're wearing
a wedding ring, Carl!
You lied to me about that!
Didn't you lie about that?!
You asked me if I had a family.
I did, but I don't anymore.
Yes? No, no, no,
there is no problem.
We're coming out right now.
Whoa, that was good.
That was good.
What, did you...
you pay some hotel desk clerk
to make that call for you,
is that what you did?
It was Captain Luc.
I've got one minute
to bring you out.
Captain Luc? Captain Luc!
Ooh, Captain Luc.
Well, Carl, I gotta say
that-that sounds
pretty official to me
but like I said, I...
I think it's just
me and you here,
it's me and you.
So you're going to have
to catch me.
Frank. Frank!
You have to trust me on this!
These people
have been embarrassed, Frank.
They're angry.
You rob their banks,
you steal their money
you live in their country.
I told you this was
what was going to happen
that there was no other way
for it to end.
Don't make a mistake!
That's good.
That's good, Carl, you know?
Keep pushing that lie.
Keep pushing it.
Keep pushing
till you make it true.
They're going to kill you!
You walk out that door,
they're going to kill you.
Is that the truth?
Yeah.
You have any children, Carl?
I have a four-year-old daughter.
You swear on your daughter?
You swear?
You swear?

In excelsius Deo.
Carl...
Carl, you have to remember
to let me call my father
when we land.
I just want to,
I want to talk to him
before he sees me on television
or something like that.
Carl, look.
That's LaGuardia right there.
Runway 4-4.
Frank, your father is dead.
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to say anything
till we got closer to home.
He-He... He fell down some steps
at Grand Central Station
trying to catch a train.
I didn't want to be the one
to tell you.
You're lying, right?
You said I could talk to him.
Carl, who are you to...
who are you to say
something like that, huh?
Who are you
to say something like that?
You said I could talk to him.
He fell, and he...
and he broke his neck.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
:
Goddamn it!
Carl, I'm going to be sick!
-
- It's all right.
It's all right. It's okay.
Carl, I got to go
to the bathroom.
I'm going to be sick.
Sure.
Let's go in the bathroom.
Goddamn it!
:
Oh, Daddy...
You'll have take your seat, sir.
I've told you twice.
We're landing.
- Sorry. Thank you...
- All of you.
Frank! Come on now.
- Frank?
- We're landing in six minutes.
All of you need to be
in your seats
- with your seat belts fastened.
- Frank, open the door!
Frank!
- You do it.
- Yeah.
Frank! Frank!
HANRATTY:
All right, remain seated,
everyone, please.
FBI. Stay seated.
FBI. Stay seated.
- Please remain seated!
- Stay seated.
STEWARDESS:
You must stay seated
until the aircraft
has come to a complete stop.
HANRATTY:
God almighty.
NAT KING COLE:
Chestnuts roasting
on an open fire...
Jack Frost nipping
at your nose
Yuletide carols
being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up
like Eskimos
Everybody knows
A turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make
the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes
all aglow
Will find it hard
to sleep tonight...
What's your name?
They know that Santa's
on his way...
Where's your mommy?
...He's loaded lots of toys
and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child
is gonna spy
To see if reindeer
really know how to fly...
And so I'm offering
this simple phrase...
To kids from one to 92
Although it's been said
many times
Many ways:
"Merry Christmas..."
Hands behind your head!
...To you.
Carl, get me in the car,
please.
Get me in the car.
HANRATTY:
Put him in.
JUDGE:
..."Merry Christmas to you."
Use that door over there.
PRISONER:
...and give everyone my love.
I think about them all the time.
Merry Christmas, Frank.
Hey, I got you
some comic books here.
How's your daughter?
What was her name?
Grace.
Well... I don't know.
She lives with her mother
in Chicago
and I don't get to see her much.
What's in the briefcase?
Oh. I'm on my way
to the airport.
It's a paperhanger
who's working his way
through Minnesota.
Aw, geez, he's...
he's driving us crazy.
You got any of the checks?
Yeah, yeah, I got a...
a counterfeit that he drew
on the Great Lakes
Savings and Loan.
See, he's just using
a stencil machine
and an Underwood.
Yeah, it's a teller at the bank.
Say again?
L-It's definitely a teller,
Carl.
I mean, banks,
they always use hand-stamps
for the dates, see.
They get used
over and over again
so they always get worn out
and the numbers
are always cracking.
The sixes and the nines...
see, they go first.
Thanks.
MAN:
Tell me what you think.
That's a fake.
How do you know?
You haven't looked at it.
Well, there's
no perforated edge, right?
I mean, this... this check
was hand-cut, not fed.
Yeah...
Paper is double-bonded
much too heavy
to be a bank check.
Magnetic ink, it's, uh,
raised against my fingers
instead of flat.
And this doesn't smell
like MICR.
It's some kind of a...
you know,
some kind of a drafting ink.
You know, the kind you get
at a stationery store.
Frank...
would you be interested
in working
with the FBI's
Financial Crimes Unit?
I already got a job here.
You know, I, uh,
deliver the mail.
Frank, we have the power
to take you out of prison.
You'd be placed
in the custody of the FBI
where you'd serve out
the remainder of your sentence
as an employee
of the federal government.
Under whose custody?
Hi. L-I'm Frank Abagnale.
I'm supposed to start work
here today.
It's a tour company
operating out of the BVI.
Sir, Mr. Abagnale is here.
I'm going to call you back.
Hello, Carl.
Welcome to the FBI.
I'll show you
where you're working.
Carl... how long
do I have to work here?
It's 8:15 in the morning
to 5:00 in the afternoon.
No, I...
I mean, how long?
Every day.
Every day, Frank,
till we let you go.
-
- Yeah.
- Hey, Carl.
- Hi.
How you doing?
It's not a good time, Frank.
I'm clearing my desk
for the weekend.
Carl, you mind if I come
to work with you tomorrow?
Tomorrow is Saturday.
I'm flying to Chicago
to see my daughter.
I'll be back to work on Monday.
You're going to see Grace, huh?
Well, that's the plan.
So what should I do till Monday?
I'm sorry, kid,
I can't help you there.
Excuse me.
This is Hanratty.
Oh, yeah, put him on.
Mr. Sawyer.
How are you?
I have a half a dozen
more checks
on that tour operator
at the BVI.
WOMAN :
American Airlines 355
serving Chicago
and San Francisco
is now open
for passenger check-in.
How'd you do it, Frank?
How'd you pass the bar
in Louisiana?
What are you doing here?
Listen...
I'm sorry I put you
through all this.
You go back to Europe, you're
gonna die in Perpignan Prison.
You try to run
here in the States
we'll send you
back to Atlanta for 50 years.
I know that.
I spent four years trying
to arrange your release.
Had to convince my bosses
at the FBI
and the Attorney General
of the United States
you wouldn't run.
Why'd you do it?
You're just a kid.
I'm not your kid.
You said you were
going to Chicago.
My daughter can't see me
this weekend.
She's going skiing.
You said she was four years old.
You're lying.
She was four when I left.
Now she's 15.
My wife's been remarried
for 11 years.
I see Grace every now and again.
I don't understand.
Sure you do.
Sometimes it's easier
living the lie.
I'm going to let you
fly tonight, Frank.
I'm not even going
to try to stop you.
That's 'cause I know
you'll be back on Monday.
Yeah? How do you know
I'll come back?
Look.
Frank...
nobody's chasing you.
WOMAN :
American Airlines flight 131
to Pittsburgh
is now ready for boarding.
Passengers with boarding passes,
please proceed to Gate 23A.
Okay.
Alice, has he still not called?
No, he hasn't.
HANRATTY:
I've, uh, called this meeting
to discuss
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting
which the unsub is washing
and altering checks
then passing them
throughout Arizona.
This unsub is a big dog
passing checks
as large as five figures.
Sorry I'm late.
Sorry.
We have a recovered check
on Agent Reiter's desk.
Why don't we step out
to the bullpen?
There's impressions
on every line.
Looks like the original amount
was for $60.
Mind if I take a look?
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.
Cost the bank $16,000.
It's a real check.
Yeah.
Yeah. It's been washed.
The only thing original
is the signature.
But it's perfect, Carl.
I mean...
I mean, this isn't hydrochloride
or bleach.
No.
Something new.
Maybe a nail polish remover
where the acetone
removes the ink
that's not been printed?
How did you do it, Frank?
How did you cheat
on the bar exam in Louisiana?
I didn't cheat.
I studied for two weeks
and I passed.
Is that the truth, Frank?
Is that the truth?
I'll bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes.
He washes off their names
and he puts on his own.
You're saying that he's a local?
Well, if it were me, you know
I'd call the bank first,
I'd check out the balance...
Make sure there's enough money
in there
to make it worth your while.
Exactly.
You know, Carl, I think
this guy's pretty smart.
I guess all we have to do now
is catch him.
We'll start first thing
in the morning.
We'll run the name
Eric Anthony Feeders.
In Nevada, Arizona, California.
