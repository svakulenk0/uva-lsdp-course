- Ready?
-
- Yeah, let's try it like that.
-
From the studios of WNYH
in New York City,
I'm GabrieI Noone,
and this is Noone at Night.
As a storyteIIer, I've spent years
Iooting my Iife for fiction.
Like a magpie, I tend to steaI
the shiny stuff and discard the rest.
The facts can alW ays be altered
When you're telling a story.
But this time.
I have to be careful.
I'll lay out the events
exactly as I remember them.
I W ant you to believe this. after all.
That'll be hard enough as it is.
This one is called ''The Night Listener. ''
It began in the W orst of all possible W eeks.
Jess had moved out.
saying it W as only temporary.
And I W as miserable.
Nothing made sense anymore.
I W as trying to read one of my ridiculous
yarns. the kind I had built a career on.
A sentimental piece
about our eighth anniversary.
But it felt so phony.
I couldn't put the W ords into our mouth.
This isn't working.
- It wasn't that bad.
- It just doesn't sound Iike me.
The IeveIs are the same.
I couId adjust.
No, no.
It-it just sounds fake.
Look, GabrieI.
We can't do this again.
Just run an oId one, OK?
I-I'm.. . You know, I can't.
I'm sorry, I just can't.
Hey.
- Why are you here?
- I thought I was gonna buy you a drink.
What happened in the session?
We're just having sound probIems.
Listen, I'm ready to coIIapse.
- You sure you don't wanna go?
- I'm sure.
None of my business,
but the station is worried.
You owe them five shows.
I reaIIy don't wanna taIk about that.
- I'm worried about you.
- I'm aII right. ReaIIy.
AII right. Look.
- Take this with you.
- Oh, no. Come on, Ashe.
- You don't have to write a bIurb.
- Thanks.
Just want you to read it.
We're pubIishing it next quarter.
''A Diary of Transcendent
Hope and Courage." Oh, pIease.
It come with aromatherapy?
Save it, wiII ya? You'II have
reaI questions after you've read it.
- Hang in there, OK?
- Yeah.
See ya.
Jesus! You scared me.
- Just, uh, picking some stuff up.
- No probIem.
See you brought Lucifer.
Lucien.
He's just a friend.
Oh, babe, I toId ya.
I just need a IittIe space.
- It's aII right.
- I'II see ya.
- No, Hugo. Go.
- Hugo. Hugo!
''Charles Dickens,"
Wrote Pete Logand.
''W as only 1 2 W hen his parents
sent him to make boot polish
''in a factory by the docks.
''This screW ed him up forever
and made him a W riter.
''I think W e've all got a
blacking factory. some terrible something
that makes us lose our baby hearts
as surely as W e lose our baby teeth. ''
Mine W as
in the basement in MilW aukee.
It W as converted into a room
that W as supposed to be my playhouse.
No one ever W ondered
Why my dad made it soundproof.
I kneW all his games
by the time I W as seven.
By the time I W as 1 1.
other groW nups W ere W ith him.
I W ondered hoW much my mom kneW .
Then one night I heard
her there in the playhouse. W hispering.
Telling somebody to move out of the W ay.
I realized she'd been there all along.
''That W as W hat
the blindfold W as for - to keep me hidden.
''So they could
sell the tapes on the Internet. ''

-
You've reached Gabriel
and Jess. Leave a message at the tone.
Hi. it's Pete Logand.
The guy W ho W rote that book?
Ashe gave me your number.
so I just W anted to...
He said if I talk long enough you might...
Oh. W ell. Bye.
- Ambushed?
- That's as good a word as any.
I thought it'd make you feeI better
to distract yourseIf.
The way I'm feeIing,
I might say something wrong.
You won't say anything wrong.
Did you Iike the book?
It's somewhat raw.
But powerfuI.
- He's a brave kid. How oId is he?
- 1 4.
Jesus.
How'd you get it?
Right over the transom.
No agent, no nothing.
- Donna just maiIed it to us.
- Who?
The sociaI worker who adopted him.
She got him to write as therapy.
You must have edited Iike crazy.
- WeII.. .
- What?
It's the cIeanest manuscript
I've had aII year.
Damn.
I wouIdn't do this to you unIess
I thought there was a reaI connection.
- Remember the basement?
- Yeah.
WeII, he Iistened
to the show after they'd gone.
- Jesus.
- He wanted me to give that to you.
Jess?
What the heII are you doing?
Hi.
I can't do your books
unIess you Ieave me your checkbook.
This pIace was a mess.
Besides, I Iike Iaundry.
It makes me happy.
The power went out. Your fuse box
is fucked up. And your dad caIIed.
- You didn't pick up, did you?
- I had to. He kept saying:
''Pick up, goddammit.
I know you're there."
He's a nice oId coot.
If he met you, he'd caII you
''that cute Chink gaI'' behind your back.
- I am a cute Chink gaI.
- Mm-hm.
How oId is he anyway?
He's got to be, Iike, ancient.
Why? Because I am?
I just hope that I'm over my parents
by the time I'm your age.
Good Iuck.
They asked about Jess.
You haven't toId 'em yet, have you?
No. 'Cause he'II be back by then.
Right.
Hello. Please leave
a message after the tone.
Hi, Pete.
This is GabrieI Noone.
Ashe gave me your number and, uh.. .
I read your book.
I reaIIy Iiked it.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You sW ear it's really you?
Why wouIdn't it be me?
I dunno.
You don't sound like yourself.
Well. I'm a little less dramatic in person.
- You sound Iike hammered shit.
-
That pins it doW n pretty W ell.
No offense.
Just can't fuckin' beIieve it's you, man.
You just fuckin' have to.
I'm sorry. My new mom
says I've got a trashy mouth.
Really?
Well. she's fuckin' right.
AnyW ay. I W as really impressed by
your book. I W ant to W ish you good luck.
So what do you guys do for Christmas?
What do you mean?
- You and Jess. Do you have a tree?
- Oh, no.
We're not that big on Christmas.
Yeah. I knoW W hat you mean.
We got a rusty water tank across the street.
They hang a damn star on it every year.
A star.
That sounds nice.
Yeah.
Except it doesn't face this way.
Just Iights up the graffiti.
The rest of the town gets ''BethIehem."
AII's we get is ''Roberta bIows."
I sW ear. big ol' red letters.
''Roberta bloW s. ''
They painted it out last year.
It came back.
- She must reaIIy bIow.
-
You OK?
Shit.
Pete?
Shit.
Yeah, I'm OK. Gotta warn me
if you're gonna be funny, man.
- Drink this.
- Sorry.
- What is it?
- Well. Donna's here noW being a pain.
I W ouldn't put up W ith it.
except she's a babe and I like redheads.
It's him.
Say something.
- Hi. This is Donna Logand.
- Hey.
I'm sorry to cut this short.
This cough is worrying me.
- WeII, sure. I understand.. .
-
HeIIo?
It's Donna.
He's asleep noW .
We had to drain his lungs.
- Has he toId you about the AIDS?
- Yeah. he did.
Listen, there are some incredibIe drugs
nowadays. They worked wonders for Jess.
Yeah, we've tried a Iot of them
but he had syphiIis when he was eight
and his Iungs are Iike Swiss cheese.
He doesn't have very long.
A feW months at the most.
It probabIy doesn't make it any easier,
being out here in the middIe of nowhere.
But I just can't have
those creeps knowing where he is.
I thought they were in prison.
His father W as. but his mother
disappeared after her arraignment.
- They don't know where she is.
- Surely after all these years...
We don't know what she's capabIe of.
But the point of moving here
is not to be paranoid. right?
The thought of that
haunted me all night.
Over the next feW W eeks.
Pete and I talked almost every day.
Who do you W ant to talk to
When your book is published?
What do you mean?
You knoW . somebody famous
Who really likes your book.
Derek Jeter wouId be cooI.
WeII. OK. Yeah.
You don't knoW W ho that is. do you?
Of course.
He's a sports guy.
Yeah, what sport?
Gettin' picky on me.
Just 'cause you're a dick-smoker
don't mean you can't watch baII games.
What?
What. a dick-smoker?
You've never heard that?
No.
WeII, no offense or nothin'.
You and, uh.. . Jess seem pretty cooI.
So, how's he doing?
- He's OK.
- So W hen can I talk to him?
WeII, that's gonna be kind of difficuIt.
He moved out a coupIe of weeks ago.
Oh, man. That sucks.
He says he needs to be aIone,
but he says he's coming back.
I'm sure. It seemed Iike
you had something speciaI.
I think you've just gotta be patient. Gabriel.
Something like that
doesn't come every day.
That's what I want.
That kind of thing.
One of these days.
Don't W orry.
You'll get it.
No. Ain't a Iot of girIs
between here and the hospitaI.
You think about girIs a Iot?
That's all I can do. man.
Think about 'em.
Seeta.
You have Playboy?
- Hey, you.
- Hey.
Hugo.
- For a friend.
- Yeah.
I was gonna caII you. I'm having a smaII
Christmas party. You wanna come?
- Sure.
- OK. I'II caII you.
- See ya.
- See ya.
So he gets the Playboy. Next thing
you know he's hiding it from his new mom.
Who knew I'd be
a heterosexuaI infIuence?
That is just the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.
- Isn't it?
- I'd be carefuI if I was you.
- Why?
- FoIks couId taIk, that's aII.
About what?
Use your damn head.
That boy was abused by gays.
He was abused by pedophiIes.
Haven't you been Iistening?
- They were men.
- Straight men.
Lift you Ieg, sweetness.
How couId they be straight
if they messed with a boy?
- They caIIed him ''faggot'' whiIe doing it.
- Do you have to make everything fiIthy?
Honey, caIm down.
Don't get so angry.
That's much easier
than feeIing something.
What kind of New Age crap is that?
Just 'cause you're shut down
doesn't mean we have to be.
- Just because you're a big crybaby.. .
- Come on, guys.
- ShouId I go somewhere?
- No.
Come on, Iet's.. .
We're gonna be Iate.
- You two seemed a IittIe better this time.
- Yeah.
Another thousand years
we'II be abIe to have a conversation.
- What were you gonna teII us about Jess?
- Nothing.
Maybe we'II see him
on our way back to RaIeigh.
Just say goodbye to the IittIe prick.
What? ''LittIe prick''? He can handIe that.
- I can handIe big ones, actuaIIy.
-
You are nasty.
- What'd he say?
- See you, Pap.
OK, son.
Hey, GabrieI!
GabrieI! Hey!
- Where are you going?
- Why'd you invite me to this?
It's a party.
RidicuIous.
GabrieI.
Come here.
What's the matter?
- Who are aII these peopIe?
- My friends. My roommate's and mine.
Since when did you know
so many peopIe?
Hey, most of my friends were your friends.
I wanted new friends.
What's the probIem here?
I don't understand what's happening.
When I moved in with you,
I was bareIy out of coIIege.
I wanted to take care of you.
And you don't think
I wanted to take care of you?
- I'm not saying that.
- That's what you think.
GabrieI, for eight years I was gonna die.
And now it Iooks Iike I'm not going to,
and I want to see what that feeIs Iike.
Look. I just.. .
If you had any guts,
you'd end this.
That's not how I feeI.
- No, no, no.
- Come here. Come here, pIease.
Comin' out.
OK?
Yeah. I'm OK.
You've reached Gabriel and
Jess. Please leave a message at the tone.
It's Donna.
I'm at the hospitaI.
He's in the oxygen tank.
It's not Iooking very good.
I don't think
he'll make it through the night.
I'll call you back W hen there's neW s. Bye.
End of message.
Ah.
Don't you think she'd have caIIed
if anything happened?
I've just got this gut feeIing.
- So caII the hospitaI.
- I don't know which one he's in.
Do you think it's possibIe
they're being a IittIe meIodramatic?
You know, the abusive parents,
the basement. It aII seems so over the top.
- Some peopIe have shitty Iives.
- They're not shitty aII the time.
They may be revving it up a bit.
I can't beIieve you'd even suggest
that a dying chiId wouId embeIIish it.
- HeIIo?
- It's Donna.
Hi.
Donna, I'm gonna put you
on speaker phone. Jess is here.
- Hi. Jess. It's nice to meet the real thing.
- It's nice to meet you, too.
Gabriel. the Bactrim's kicked in.
Pete's better this morning.
Thank God.
- He wants to say heIIo.
- Sure. Put him on.
- Hey. dude.
- Hey, kiddo. How you feeIin'?
- Better than yesterday.
- Great.
Hey, Jess is here.
He's fixing my fuse box.
I don't even W anna knoW
What that means.
OK. Well. they W ant me
to go to sleep noW . You guys stay cool.
- SIeep tight, dude.
-
What a reIief.
Yeah.
What?
I think it's the same voice, babe.
What?
Yeah. Pete and Donna. I.. .
I don't know,
they.. . they have the same voice.
One is higher-pitched, but they're.. .
Are you saying
it's some kind of impersonation?
Yeah, more or Iess.
- Why wouId someone do that?
- I don't know.
- Dozens of peopIe know them.
- Who?
Doctors. There's a nurse
who comes and stays at the house.
You've onIy been toId that.
- What about Ashe?
- Did he ever actuaIIy go to Wisconsin?
He must have.
What about the photo?
That couId be anybody.
- There's ways to prove this.
- Hey.
I'm happy to be wrong.
No. No, you're never
happy to be wrong.
This is the first time I've feIt decent
in weeks. Why are you trying to destroy it?
Because this isn't one of your stories.
You never Iook at things for what they are.
- That's such buIIshit.
- BuIIshit?
BuIIshit? OK.
Where exactIy did I teII you
I tested positive?
- What the.. .
- Answer the question!
In the park on a bench
in front of those guys pIaying drums.
No.
No, that's what you put in your show.
It was at a grimy oId deIi on 3rd.
But that's not very interesting, is it?
Look, I moved out
because I needed a break.
You aIways sift through this reIationship
Iooking for materiaI for your show.
TeII me you didn't fuckin' reIish it.
I went aIong with the show because
I thought it gave my death meaning.
But I don't need that anymore.
WeII, great. Because there's no show.
Are you happy?
That's not my fauIt.
You don't know him.
Maybe.
- Looks transparent to me.
- What's that supposed to mean?
You're aIways taIking about wanting kids.
And now you've created this.. .
- Fuck you. You're such an asshoIe!
- Fuck it. You know, go pIay with Tiny Tim.
Do you know anyone
who actuaIIy met Pete Logand?
No.
Not a doctor or a sociaI worker
or neighbor, anybody?
They Iive in Wisconsin.
Jess thinks Pete and Donna sound aIike.
- They do.
- That doesn't strike you as odd?
Pete didn't taIk when he came to Iive
with her and ended up imitating her.
- That wasn't in the book.
- A Iot isn't.
- You know 'cause she toId you.
- Yeah.
- You got aII of your information from her.
- Her and Pete.
Did she show you a birth certificate,
an adoption document,
something substantiaI?
If you think it's a hoax,
you're off base.
- Why?
- Because!
I spent over a year speaking with them and
they toId me things you couIdn't imagine.
Now, maybe your present situation
is coIoring the way you think.
It has nothing to do with that.
You're about to pubIish a book
by an author you know shit about.
ShouIdn't you be a IittIe concerned?
You've reached Gabriel and
Jess. Please leave a message at the tone.
Oh. uh... Well. I guess
you're not there so I'll just try again.
- HeIIo?
- Oh. it's Donna.
Hi.
I know this isn't much notice, but we'd
Iove for you to come visit for Christmas.
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah. sure.
The guest room ain't fancy.
but I cook a mean plum pudding
and it W ould mean so much to Pete.
- So...
-
- Is that Pete?
- Yeah. he still has a cough.
But he's fine.
So. can you come?
I can't think of a better way
to spend Christmas.
- That's great.
- Yeah, it is. ReaIIy is.
- Hey, GabrieI.
- Hey, Marie.
- Didn't know you pIayed basebaII.
- Oh, no. It's a gift for a friend.
Signed by, uh, Jerry Deter.
You mean Derek Jeter?
- Yeah. Yeah.
-
Fuck, she baiIed on you.
- What was her excuse?
- There was no excuse.
Doctor said he shouIdn't have any visitors.
They're worried about him catching a fIu.
Fucking pIanes are petri dishes. I don't
want him to catch something from me.
So Iater, maybe.
Yeah. If he's stiII around.
WeII, you never know.
No, you don't.
Not about anything.
- We shouIdn't see each other anymore.
- Babe, it doesn't have to be Iike this.
Yeah, babe.
I don't want to be jerked around.
I want a cIean break.
- We're not gonna speak to each other?
- I'm too oId for this shit.
- Come on, GabrieI.
- Listen, you ruined what we had.
You're the fucking one
who can't see the reaIity.
What do you mean there won't be a book?
I thought your editor beIieved this kid.
He does, but his bosses got coId feet.
- And Donna and Pete?
- They're totaIIy devastated.
What do you have?
There is no record of any Pete Logand
in any kind of triaI.
Doesn't mean anything.
Pete took Donna's name
when she adopted him.
Ashe thinks
they were using an aIias
because that way his reaI mother
couIdn't track him down.
Cute kid.. . whoever he is.
Why wouId someone do this?
That's what I keep asking.
It's a hideous way
to promote a book.
Maybe it's not about that for her. Maybe
she doesn't even know she's doing it.
Like a muItipIe-personaIity thing?
Wait, what if she had a kid
who died in some, Iike, horribIe way
and now she needs to assume
his identity in order to.. .
No.
What if she has him embaImed?
- You know, Iike that guy from Psycho?
- Mm.
No, wait. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What if she's the one who doesn't exist?
What if he's impersonating her?
PIease, now stop it.
This is not some sort of parIor game.
Sorry.
What if there is some haIf-dead kid and
I've just taken away his Iast shred of hope?
I couIdn't Iive with that.
Ever thought about a voiceprint?
Like what the cops use?
They're as good as fingerprints.
Now you're scaring me.
Hey. it's Davia.
There's a neW Thai place...
- No.
-
- Hey. dick-smoker.
- That's him. Stop it.
- OK. So what do you have from her?
- Nothing. I erased the Iast message.
Then you have to caII her.
Get her on tape.
- How do I do that?
- Uh.. .
You just, uh, press this button
right before you taIk to her.
I don't know, uh.. .
It's an answering machine,
not a thermonucIear device.
But what if I'm, you know,
recording her and the machine beeps?
We're sorry. The number
you have reached is not in service.
Please check the number
or try your call again. This is a recording.
So, do you have
famiIy in Wisconsin?
Yes, actuaIIy. A son.
Oh.
He Iives with his mother, though.
But I get to see him on hoIidays.
- How oId is he?
- 1 4.
You must have had him Iate.
- WeII, yeah, I.. . FairIy, yeah.
-
Do you have any pictures?
As a matter of fact.. .
Oh, my goodness.
Look at those eyes.
Yeah.
He has your nose and chin though.
- Does he?
- Hm.
Excuse me.
I hope this isn't too pushy,
but I saw your name on the passenger Iist
and I just wanted to say I reaIIy appreciate
everything you've done.. . for us.
The pIeasure was mine.
You've done something
for fIight attendants?
We're sorry. The number
you have reached is not in service...
Please check-
Fuck.
Hi.
I've done something reaIIy dumb
and I was hoping you couId heIp me.
I have a good friend
who Iives here in Montgomery.
I've aIways assumed that 51 1 Henzke
was her actuaI address.
You meet her onIine?
No. Nothing Iike that. It's just.. .
She's a good friend and I'm sure she
comes in here aII the time. Donna Logand?
PeopIe pay us so they don't
have to use their reaI address.
It's the point of the pIace.
WeII, sure.
She's a friend.
I came a Iong way to.. .
OK. Fine.
Hey!
- Are you OK?
- Thanks, yeah.
OK.
You Iike those burgers,
but they're awfuI on your tummy.
I'II fix you something when we get home.
Hey. You back for more cocoa?
- Does twice a day make me a junkie?
- Not by me. Anything for him?
Oh, no, thanks.
We shouIdn't make a habit of it.
- You mind if I have a cuddIe?
- Go ahead.
He needs aII the Iove he can get.
Don't you?
OK, Iet's go.
See ya.
You betcha. Stay warm.
Aren't you gonna say heIIo, GabrieI?
ChamomiIe OK?
Sure.
- Is this enough Iight?
- It's fine. Thanks.
It was Hank.
The cIerk at the grocery store?
- That's how I knew you were here.
- Oh.
- It's not some spooky bIind thing.
- Oh.
How Iong have you been bIind?
I remember a doIIhouse I used to have,
my father's face, things Iike that.
What about your mother?
She died when I was two. My father tried
to raise me. I guess Ashe didn't teII you.
- No.
- WeII.. .
It makes us more vuInerabIe. We've
aIready had to move once this year.
It's reaIIy wonderfuI
what you've done for Pete, though.
How did you find us, anyway?
The star. I.. .
I remember Pete mentioned
he couId see a star on a water tower.
And, uh, when I saw it, I just found.. .
AII the way to the house?
WeII, to this bIock.
And I saw you on the front porch and.. .
So.. .
Who foIIowed me from the coffee shop?
It's important I be abIe to trust you, GabrieI.
- Your phone Iine was down. I figured.. .
-
The tea.
Can I use your bathroom?
Sure. Top of the stairs.
- You found his room.
-
Velveteen Rabbit.
I used to have one of those.
So, Pete.. .
He's at the hospitaI getting tests.
It's not Iooking good.
- I'm sorry. His Iungs?
- Yeah.
They're getting worse.
- Can I see him tomorrow?
- That'd be great.
- He means a Iot to you, doesn't he?
- Yeah, he does.
WeII, I know he feeIs
the same way about you.
As a matter of fact.. .
The lights
of the highW ay are streaming past
and one of you reaches out
and holds the other one's leg.
It's the truest moment in the W orld.
- That's one of our favorite episodes.
-
Thank you.
So Pete toId me about you and Jess.
You two seemed good together.
- Do you stiII Iove him?
- I don't know.
Does he feeI the same way?
I don't know what he thinks.
CouId I.. .
get a face to go with the voice?
Sure.
It's a hard pIace to be,
not knowing for sure.
Yeah, it's purgatory.
And you're just the kind of guy
who needs proof.
The heII of it is,
we're onIy as Ioved as we think we are.
I can't wait to see him.
Who, Jess?
No, Pete.
I'm sorry.
Everyone does it.
He's just speciaI that way.
Yeah.
I need your heIp.
-
- Whoa.
- What?
- It's very dark.
I don't know where the Iight switch is.
Try by the door.
Somewhere in here
is my other sewing bag.
I've been spending so much time at the
hospitaI, I'm making Pete a new sweater.
Can you heIp me find the dark green one?
It'II go reaIIy weII with his eyes.
Here.
Thanks.
Hey, do you wanna see my sweater?
Sure.
I stiII need to put the buttons on,
but it's kind of fun.
- Turn around.
- Oh, OK.
I'm reaIIy trusting you here.
You better not be peeking.
I won't.
OK.
Turn around.
How does it Iook?
WeII.. . It's.. .
It's nice.
You wanna feeI it?
It's nice and soft.
FeeI it.
Yeah, soft. Right.
It's nice.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. It's nice.. .
- Is there something wrong with me?
- No, it's fine.. .
I know you Iike guys.
I was just trying to be friendIy.
You're such a fucking weirdo.
Turn around!
I'm sorry. I.. .
So are you the reason
his book was canceIed?
That's what I thought.
That book meant everything to him.
That's why I'm here. I'II heIp him
find a new pubIisher. I'II do anything.. .
It's obvious why you came here.
You don't beIieve us.
I do.
- Let's just forget about tomorrow.
- No! I want to see him.
You know,
I thought you'd be different.
I thought you'd be abIe to Iook into his souI
with his compIexities and contradictions
and see him as your own
fIesh and bIood the way I do.
That is how I see him.
I don't think so.
You wouIdn't have distrusted us.
I spent two days stumbIing around
this fucked-up pIace so that I can say.. .
Just so you couId say what?
That you were sorry for thinking him
a fraud? Give me a fuckin' break.
Pete needs peopIe
who are reaIIy there for him.
And there's no way
I'm taking you to see him.
No way.
Your car is here.
- Where's the nearest hospitaI?
- Madison. But that's 50 miIes from here.
- That's fine. Let's go.
- OK.
L-o-g-a-n-d.
There's no Pete or Peter Logand
Iisted anywhere here.
Maybe he's Iisted under another name.
So what name shouId I be Iooking for?
I don't know.
Maybe you're at the wrong hospitaI.
I've been to aII the others.
He's gotta be here.
Can I just go up to Pediatrics
and Iook around?
What do you think?
Thanks for your time.
God, no.
I'm sorry.
I-I-I made a mistake.
I thought you were someone eIse.. .
Who are you?
Security!
Security! Security!
Oh.
Oh.. .
HeIIo?
HeIIo.
Oh.
- Can I top you off there?
- Sure.
There was a bIind woman here Iast night.
- Donna.
- Yeah.
Have you seen the boy she takes care of?
I haven't seen him in a whiIe.
You mean Pete.
Yeah, that's him.
Have you seen him?
He's at the hospitaI.
He's a very sick boy.
Have you ever actuaIIy seen Pete?
He spends most of his time
at the hospitaI.
Which hospitaI is he at?
Can I get you anything eIse?
So you won't heIp me.
You have a nice day.
HeIIo.
I-I was just visiting a friend.
Maybe you know him. Pete?
Have you ever seen him?
I don't know what she toId you, but I.. .
What are we doing?
Ow!
What are we doing?
What the heII are we doing?
Wait. But wait, she's been.. .
Everybody know.. .
-
-
What you sick fucks did to that boy.
-
-
You Ieave him aIone now, perv!
You Ieave him aIone now!
GabrieI?
- I'm sorry. They're very protective of me.
- Stay away from me, Donna.
I came back to heIp you.
Why are you pissed at me?
You broke into our house.
I went to the fucking hospitaI.
He wasn't there!
- You went to the wrong hospitaI.
- I went to every damn hospitaI in Madison.
He was in MiIwaukee.
Of course. If I asked which one,
you'd say he moved.
- Just stop it.
- Or he suddenIy.. .
He's dead.
He died Iast night.
BiIateraI pneumonia.
His Iungs were saturated
and they couIdn't resuscitate him.
Jesus, you're good.
- What?
- You have a fuckin' answer for everything.
Oh.
It's the truth!
Yeah.
- If someone gets cIose, you kiII him off.
- You don't know what you're taIking about!
They know everything! And they're caIIing
the hospitaIs. They don't Iike being Iied to.
I'm not Iying!
Jesus, why did I come here?
You know why? Because you thought
this wouId make a great fucking story.
You'II taIk about me and Peter on the radio.
That's what this has aIways been about.
AII you care about is your audience Ioving
you. What kind of sick person are you?
For years Jess was dying and you
picked over him Iike a vuIture. Stay.
You're so pathetic, you actuaIIy think
he's gonna come back to you.
Ohh..
Jesus. Get up.
Like you care,
you heartIess fuck!
-
-
Come on,
there's a truck coming.
HeIp me.
- I can't Iet you do this.
-
- Let go of my arm!
- He's aII I have.
Ah, oh!
- Get up! Get up!
- Ah!
Ah!
Fucking crazy!
GabrieI?
GabrieI!
Come back here!
Come here!
GabrieI, don't Ieave me!
You don't know what you're doing!
GabrieI!
Don't Ieave me!
Hey. Hey, how are you?
- Gone?
- She left.
Who told you that?
The police.
They W ent to check on her
and the house W as empty.
Did they find
the kid at the hospitaI?
There never was a kid.
You've reached Gabriel and
Jess. Please leave a message at the tone.
- And that's been going on for three days?
- Yeah.
- You have to caII the poIice.
- What am I gonna say?
''Excuse me, Officer, but there's
this crazy bIind Iady in Wisconsin
''who has an imaginary chiId
and she's upset with me."
No, fuck her.
I'm not turning my Iife inside out.
- She tried to kiII you.
- Yeah.
WeII, tried to kiII herseIf
and me aIong with her, yeah.
I did some research. There's this actuaI
pathoIogy caIIed ''factitious disorder."
The peopIe who have it feeI unworthy of
Iove so they make up stuff to get sympathy.
Like, uh, their own iIIness
or - no thanks - a sick chiId.
It's, uh, it's Iike Munchausen's by proxy,
onIy there is no chiId.
- They don't know they're doing this?
- They know.
But the attention feeIs so good
they can't stop Iying.
What happens if you caII them on the Iie?
I don't know.
It didn't say.
Hm.
Great.
She caIIed two days ago.
She started shouting at me.
Just ranting and raving.
CompIeteIy out of it.
This woman is reIentIess.
She's desperate.
I mean, just so desperate.
She's bIind.
What is she gonna do?
No fucking way.
This is Gabriel and Jess...
- ShouId we pick up?
- No.
No, it might set her off,
trigger something.
- What shouId we do?
- Ignore it.
HeIIo?
Your story doesn't
have an ending. Gabriel.
I'm at the Hudson Plaza Motel at JFK.
Room 1 4 2.
I left something for you.
Donna?
Who's this?
It's me. It's Pete.
Gabriel. is that you?
Don't freak out. I knoW she told you I W as
dead. She W as just trying to protect me.
Where are you?
I'm at the airport. W aiting for Donna.
Is she there?
No. She just Ieft.
Too bad.
I really W anted you two to talk.
I kind of promised her I W ouldn't
talk to you. She's mad at you.
- Pete?
- Yeah?
I need to ask you something.
What?
Did something happen to Donna
when she was IittIe?
- You understand, right?
- Yeah. but...
I don't knoW .
She never talks about her childhood.
Did she ever teII you
what caused her bIindness?
No.
I think she fell doW n the stairs.
You know,
there's peopIe who can heIp her.
I have to go noW .
OK, kiddo.
- Bye.
- Bye.
You know, that tape
doesn't prove anything.
That kid couId be anybody, right?
CouId be a neighbor, cousin.
Yeah, I know.
So, what is it, then?
It's just.. .
What?
How can I be missing someone
who never existed?
Is that possibIe?
Hey.
What about those Star Trek conventions?
You know, aII those guys, they dress up
Iike Kirk and Spock, right? Why?
Because they reaIIy miss them.
Am I that pathetic?
Hey.
You have got a great big heart.
That's the best part about you.
It aIways was.
I gotta go.
From the studios
of WNYH in New York City,
I'm GabrieI Noone
and this is Noone at Night.
As a storyteIIer, I've spent years
Iooting my Iife for fiction.
Like a magpie, I tend to steaI
the shiny stuff and discard the rest.
WeII, we've wandered
in the woods for an hour
onIy to discover
that we've circIed back on ourseIves.
And in the end,
I'm not sure what reaIIy happened.
But it is cIear that Donna and I
are more aIike than not.
Both of us afraid.
Not W anting to be alone.
Longing for a good listener.
It sounds perfect.
And we aIso have a modeI condo avaiIabIe
with aII the furniture incIuded.
That'd be great.
And, uh.. . when does your son
get out of the hospitaI?
Tomorrow.
That's tight.
But, no, we can work it out.
Thank you.
If you don't mind me asking.. .
how did he Iose his Ieg?
As for Pete. there's a line
in ''The Velveteen Rabbit'' that reads.:
''Real isn't hoW you're made.
''It's the thing that happens to you. ''
I'm Gabriel Noone.
Good night.
