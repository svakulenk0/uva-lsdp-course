ORDELL:
So, what do you think?
LOUIS: What I don't
see, I don't see
a schedule of events.
It's a little loose.
But see, what we are right
now is it be flexible.
You see what I mean?
And it can go down any time
once the old man is gone.
And now that we know
that he's going away
and she gonna be
there all alone,
that might be
too good to wait.
The guy's pulling about 50K
a month out of Detroit.
Not declaring it, not paying
taxes, any of that shit.
Okay, why isn't that enough?
Hold that over his head.
He pays you or you go to
the Federal Building.
Because I know
he's doing it, but
I can't prove it.
I tell you,
the man ain't dumb.
It ain't like he
got his name on no
papers or nothing.
We take this man's wife...
Okay, he's so
scared that he gotta pay.
And it ain't like he can
stall us out and tell us,
"It's gonna take
me a couple of weeks
to get the money together."
Not if he wanna
see his wife again.
Hey, listen, Louis,
you done heard all about it.
You with it or not?
Guy come out behind me?
No.
Wait.
Yeah, you mean this big
dude with the Borsalino?
Um, yeah.
I'm in the can,
comes up, says, "Hey,
loan me some money."
I say, "Loan you some
money? You want a buck
for a drink, what?"
He pulls a knife,
says he wants to borrow
whatever I got in my wallet.
Mother took $27.
Talk some shit to him.
Try to get him out in
the middle of the street.
Nah, I don't
think it'd work.
Try it.
If it don't,
then keep running.
Hey, you!
BORSALINO: The fuck you
want? You wanna take
another $30 leak?
What?
How about you quit
hiding behind a knife
and a bunch of women,
you fat tub of shit
and come out here?
What the...
That's right.
Get your ass up.
Come on!
WOMAN: Damn!
Dropped this.
Yeah.
How much this cost him?
Couple hundred.
I hope he learned something,
but I doubt it.
FRANK: Eighteenth hole.
The guy's standing over
his tee shot for what
seems like an eternity.
Finally his partner says,
"What is taking you so long?
"Hit the damn ball!"
The guys says,
"Well, my wife is up there
watching from the clubhouse,
"and I wanna make
this a perfect shot."
His partner says,
"Give me a break!"
"There ain't a snowball's
chance in hell
"you're gonna
hit her from here!"
Hi.
Hi!
Hi.
How you doing, Marshall?
I'm great.
RAY: Mr. and Mrs.
Frank Dawson.
Tally-ho, everyone.
What happened,
they couldn't
find a bigger trophy?
I'm gonna have to
buy a bigger house
to put it in.
Have you met
Mickey, my wife?
No. Hi, Mickey.
Ray Shelby.
Nice to meet you.
She's the other
trophy in my life.
Hello, Mickey.
Hi.
MICKEY: Frank.
Hey, Frank.
I'll drive.
I'd really like to.
FRANK: You know what's funny?
After 15 years, I still
have to explain to you
this is work,
winning this thing.
Frank...
You make remarks like
it's a piece of shit.
I never said that!
Frank. Watch the road!
This here is like
the Statue of Liberty
with a golfer on top!
Please watch the road.
I did not say that.
An innocent little voice,
"Cute little Mickey Dawson."
"Oh, my, isn't she precious.
Such a skinny little thing."
"I wonder, how does
she keep her figure?"
What she does is she watches
her husband like a hawk!
Pecking at him...
Careful! Stop!
Counting his drinks.
Just leave the car
out here, please.
Gets so wrapped in it,
she burns calories.
Okay, slow down! It's fine.
I got this.
What the hell!
Why did you park
in the middle
of the driveway?
I'm never driving
drunk with you again!
And now you're
saying I'm drunk!
RICHARD: This here,
your Kentucky rifle.
Black powder musket,
flintlock.
Winchester Mercury,
12 gauge, double
barrel, short.
Blow a hole in
you the size of
a basketball close in.
M1 Garand, Army,
World War II.
That's beautiful.
German standard issue.
M1 carbine,
standard issue.
US Army, World War II.
Lot of people
think this is a Luger.
This is not.
It's a Walther P38.
Your dad was in
the war, right?
Yeah, tank gunner.
Yeah, but...
Which side was he on?
So, Richard, you're telling me
all these herbs come
from your own garden?
Yeah, from the fall.
They're dried now.
Um, really good.
You went and pee
in this, did you?
I just fucking with you.
I know you ain't peed.
I could tell if
you did, though.
What? What's the matter?
Oh, that. That ain't...
It's actually my favorite.
But, you know,
Richard don't think...
Some niggas is all right,
ain't they? Right?
Some.
ORDELL: You like
that Diahann Carroll,
don't you?
Don't get cute for
company. You talk
about her all the time.
But the rest of them,
and I tend to agree
with him on this one,
he said they need
to go back to Africa.
The ones on welfare.
Right. Of course
the ones on welfare.
You know,
they ain't doing shit.
They ain't
contributing to society.
He said I could stay, though.
At least until we
finish the job, you know.
We should get going.
Yeah, you don't...
You don't want nothing?
You don't want me
to follow her today?
No.
No, no. No, that's fine.
We're good today.
We'll get in touch
with you, Richard.
He's incredible.
He's amazing.
Listen, all I got to
do was tell him,
"Hey, Richard,
this a rich, big Jew."
And then it's like,
"This is for the cause."
Then he would do it
even if he didn't
need the money so bad.
What's he need money for?
Buy more guns?
Hitler's underwear?
No.
His
old lady left him.
Ran off, took Richard
Junior and everything.
No kidding.
Yeah.
Now he think that
they in California
'cause he got a
postcard from Disneyland.
Jesus.
He so dumb,
it's adorable.
LOUIS: That's her?
ORDELL: That's her.
Hmm.
I was expecting someone older.
Oh, that's her.
That's the one we want.
That's Mickey.
BO: Why'd they have
to choose us for
this stupid article?
Because you won that day.
It's mostly about you.
"Children's games
become their career."
"Proud mother
Margaret 'Mickey' Dawson
"watches her son
Bo smash a volley."
Bo, why don't we
focus on today's game?
You didn't wake me up.
I didn't know you
were playing today.
You didn't say anything.
I never play
tennis on Sundays, huh?
Well...
Why would I play
tennis on Sundays?
I'm just...
Hey, Bo, what do
I do every Sunday?
Tennis.
Play tennis.
Okay.
Why do I have to wake up
to that neighbor's dog?
How many times
have we told him?
"Keep it locked up."
Hey, Frank, your
name's in the paper.
For the Club Championship?
No, it's actually
about the kids.
You know, the
kids playing tennis?
Oh, oh, look at that!
It's the two of you there.
Yeah.
That's a nice
picture of Bo.
You look stressed, honey.
Listen, since I'm,
uh, going down to Freeport
the end of the week...
I told you
about that, right?
I don't know.
You might have.
Yeah, I'm sure I did.
Group of investors
coming all the
way from Japan.
Can you believe it?
So, I figured,
why not fly down
to South Beach.
Tonight.
With Bo? See your folks.
Get him settled,
then I'll hop on
the shuttle to Freeport.
What do you think, Bo?
Sound like fun?
I just don't see why
all of a sudden he has to go.
How many times?
You don't say "he."
You know who I mean.
That's not the
point, all right?
He, your father,
will be in Freeport,
and he thought
it would be nice
for you guys to
fly down together
and spend some quality time.
He'll probably
check out the camp.
You know, he loves
watching you. So...
He loves to tell me what
to do. He doesn't know shit.
Well, does he?
Hello. This is the
residence of Ordell Robbie.
ORDELL:
Yeah. Shelby.
Hmm, that's right,
Mr. Ray Shelby.
He told me Frank gonna
be gone all this week
starting tomorrow.
Tomorrow? That fast?
"Hey, let's make it a party.
Why don't you bring
your friend Frank?"
He told me, "Frank?
Frank's leaving town
tomorrow with his son."
You saying that Frank is
leaving town with his son?
Listen, Bo.
What?
When you get back...
Not now,
'cause we don't have
enough time, but... Um...
For what?
A talk.
You know, cut all
the baloney and
just tell each other
how we really feel.
Hmm?
Okay.
What are you
thinking about?
How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
You know, I seem to recall
saying something
to you last night.
You remember?
What?
I asked if you'd
have lunch with me.
Marshall, you were
drunk. We all were.
You say things...
Mmm-hmm,
and what if I meant it?
Isn't Tyra waiting
for you somewhere?
If she asks,
we're just talking about
the piece in the paper.
Haven't read it yet.
Don't.
What I'm gonna do is
cut out the picture
and keep it in my wallet.
Marshall, come on!
There's nothing
too bad about lunch.
What is the point?
I'd like to talk to you.
We're talking right now.
Do you remember
any of the things
I said last night?
Marshall.
How I've been
thinking about you?
Okay, I gotta go.
Bo's match is in a moment,
so I'm late for that.
I hear Frank's
off to the Bahamas.
Just for a few days.
I asked him if he
wanted to play next Saturday
and he said he'd be
gone the whole week.
When...
Lunch tomorrow?
Scalintella, 1:00?
No, when did he...
This is really
not a good idea.
You're right.
Okay?
You're right.
I'll just come over.
Oh, there's Frank.
Hi.
Okay. Frank is coming,
so let's just...
Okay, I'll see you.
Hey, you keep your wife
out here, someone's
liable to steal her.
You promise?
See you inside.
You bet.
You sent a waitress
back to come get me?
I asked her if
she'd seen you.
DOORMAN: Having
lunch with us today, sir?
Tennis. Maybe tomorrow.
UMPIRE: Out!
LOUIS: Okay, we send the
guy a note, we call him?
No, we call him.
We call him.
UMPIRE: Game, Mithen.
LOUIS:
ORDELL:
We got masks. She
got a mask with tape
covering the eye hole.
LOUIS: And how do you know
the money's still in Freeport?
ORDELL:
LOUIS:
ORDELL:
LOUIS:
ORDELL:
So you're thinking tonight?
No.
No, I gotta call
Mr. Walker, make sure
everything's straight.
I don't see nothing
wrong with tomorrow.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry. Thank you.
Mrs. Dawson?
Yes?
I think this is
your son's racket.
I found it there.
I was gonna hand
it in at the desk.
Oh, it is. Thanks.
That's okay.
Okay.
WOMAN:
I'm so sorry, Mom.
Frank had
a meeting at the club
and he missed his flight.
WOMAN:
MICKEY: Tidying up
and doing the house.
It's nice to have
a little break actually.
WOMAN:
MICKEY: He's eating.
You know, he's been
playing a lot of tennis.
WOMAN:
How is Bo?
Oh, nothing. Just,
somebody crashed into it,
but no one was in the car,
so it's all good.
MICKEY: So, were Dad and Frank
up all night talking?
WOMAN:
MICKEY: Yeah, well,
you know Frank.
He doesn't...
WOMAN:
MICKEY: Okay.
WOMAN:
MICKEY: I have so
much to do here.
WOMAN:
Okay, I'm putting
away some groceries,
so I'm gonna go.
I love you.
Give my love to Bo.
WOMAN:
Okay.
LOUIS: It's okay.
You're all right.
LOUIS: What happened?
ORDELL: Let's go.
LOUIS: Aw, shit,
she don't have any shoes
on. She's bleeding.
ORDELL: She don't
need no shoes. Let's go.
All right. Come on.
MICKEY: If you want
money, my purse is on
the table. I have...
Get down.
Are you expecting
somebody?
My husband is coming
home. He's...
No. Ain't your husband.
LOUIS: Come on,
get up. Get up.
MICKEY: Ah!
LOUIS: Come on.
Go upstairs. Let's go.
MICKEY: Ouch.
LOUIS: Last step.
Here you go.
Keep moving.
Keep your mouth shut.
It's all right. Go.
Ah.
Turn around. Sit.
Frank?
Frank?
You on your trip?
Fuck.
Shit.
Ouch.
Oh, God.
Hold still.
Ah! Ow!
Got it.
Shh! Not a peep.
Did somebody say
they wanted
an ice-cold martini?
What the heck?
Marshall?
Oh! Shit.
It's just him?
Just him.
Who the fuck is this?
Marshall.
Who the fuck is that?
LOUIS: Listen. He's gonna
wake up at some point.
ORDELL: I know that.
LOUIS: So we call the husband,
tell him not to call the cops.
It doesn't matter,
this guy's already been here.
ORDELL: Correct.
Dawson comes home, finds him,
he's gotta call the cops.
So, what are you saying?
We just quit? Just leave?
No.
We're this far.
We take her.
LOUIS: There, step up.
Step up!
Ah.
Up. There you go.
There you go. Step.
Almost there.
Keep going. Three more.
Go on.
Oh, God.
Turn around. Sit.
When you hear the door close,
you can take the mask off.
I'll come up later
and bandage your foot.
Excuse me.
No talking.
Need to use the bathroom,
knock on the door
and put your mask back on.
Mickey?
MELANIE:
FRANK:
MELANIE: Frank, incorrect.
FRANK: I don't know.
MELANIE: Niki Lauda?
FRANK:
I don't know who that is.
MELANIE: You get a grape.
Betty Bacall,
or Lauren Bacall?
I know her.
Yeah, she's an actress.
Oh.
All right. You get a grape.
Yves Saint Laurent?
Yeah,
he makes women's clothes.
Very impressive.
Alain Delon?
Alain Delon.
Uh.
No?
Georgia O'Keeffe?
She's a stripper.
Please, Frank!
I'm giving you the easy ones.
These are people
with style, like you, baby.
Jack Nicholson
you know. Anyone with
a brain cell knows him.
Lelous Delafilace.
For Christ's sake.
Jean Renoir?
I don't wanna play anymore.
Meanie.
Okay. What do you wanna do?
You wanna fuck?
The mouth on you!
Since we're
going to bed, yeah.
You wanna do the
Florentine thing again?
Which one is that?
Whoo!
WOMAN:
News 4 Detroit,
MAN:
I'll leave you
a couple of smokes.
Thank you.
TYRA: Why is it so loud?
You call Mickey
to see when
Frank will be back?
I told you no one answered.
So, this is the Lucy Anne.
Which one do you like?
That one.
I thought you
liked the green.
Can I please
go to the mall?
The mall? It's
8:30 at night.
No. Nothing's open.
MARSHAL: How many rings?
What?
GIRL: What?
How many rings did you
give it when you called?
Oh, my God,
what is the
matter with you?
Did that car accident
turn my husband
into a crazy person?
ORDELL: So this is
the same girl you're
talking about?
MAN:
She's not an island girl?
MAN:
No, I hear you.
I hear you, bro.
I hear you.
MAN:
MAN:
You done playing doctor?
You gonna tell me or
keep it to yourself?
So Walker said he's
staying at his place
by the golf course.
What else?
And he's got
a lady with him.
LOUIS:
See, I knew he
liked the ladies,
but I didn't know he
was going down there
to see the same
lady every time.
I'm thinking he
got, you know,
couple of friends,
couple of birds
around town,
but no.
No. Walker says
the same one all the time.
Melanie.
I don't see the
problem. So he's got
something on the side.
I didn't say it
was a problem.
I just like to
know this man's shit.
Like, you know, what
he up to, what he doing
down there. Like...
Who's this Melanie?
So let's call and ask him.
Not yet.
I filed.
You have?
Why didn't you tell me?
Talked to
the lawyer on Friday.
He said the papers
would be delivered
to the house on Tuesday.
So you came down here early.
Give her some time
to think about it.
And what's she gonna do?
Oh, she'll probably
go along with it.
She'll say
things to her friends,
suck around for sympathy.
"Poor little thing."
"The prick."
What's she like?
What's she interested in?
Do you mind me asking?
No, I don't mind.
Uh, my drinking,
that's a popular subject.
"How many drinks
have you had, Frank?"
Or, "Where's Bo?
It's late.
He's not home yet."
Bo, that's something
I'm gonna have to deal
with in the settlement.
She is his mother.
I'm not gonna argue that.
But it's all right.
He and I'll see each other.
I'd like to meet your son.
Well, someday you will,
if you don't take
that big canvas bag
of yours and
take off somewhere.
I'm not gonna take off.
Hmm.
Yeah?
I wanna go to the bathroom.
You got the mask?
Oh, yeah. Hold on.
You think that dude
is still in the closet?
You hit him.
I didn't hit
him that hard.
You hope you didn't.
Oh.
Okay.
All right.
Oh, God.
Okay. Now, when you get in
here and the door's closing,
you can take off the mask
and do your business.
There you go.
LOUIS: What in
the hell are you doing?
Jesus Christ.
It's my house,
ain't it?
LOUIS: What's the
matter with you?
Don't like it?
RICHARD: You two can go
somewhere else for all I care.
Let's hurry up
in there. You done?
No, not yet.
My mask is off.
ORDELL: Hey, Richard.
Come here, man.
We gonna need you to
get back in the uniform
and get back out in
the field and do some
reconnaissance work.
Go to the lady's house,
gain access to the premises.
Just go to Dawson's
house and make sure
the guy Marshall's not dead.
Basically.
Okay.
He was upstairs,
in the closet.
Oh, this is unbelievable.
Yeah, I know.
It's a little strange.
You watch the news?
Yes.
ORDELL: There's
nothing about you
on the 7:30 or the 8:00.
Why you think?
What are you asking me for?
LOUIS: You got something
going with that guy?
He's a friend of the family.
Well, he must
be the godfather,
bringing you
martinis to your bedroom
while your husband's away.
LOUIS: How come he
didn't call the police?
I don't know! He could
be dead or in a coma.
You hit him with
something, right?
LOUIS:
He let himself out.
ORDELL: So now,
we waiting on the 11:00 news.
What we mean is
we don't know Marshall,
or what he's got to lose,
but is he the kind of
guy who'd stick his
neck out for you?
Honestly, guys, I don't know.
I don't know.
MELANIE:
Are you gonna get that?
FRANK: I don't know.
MELANIE: Did you
want me to get it?
FRANK: No, I got it.
I'll get it.
You stay in bed.
Go back to sleep.
Yeah.
ORDELL:
Who is this?
My wife?
LOUIS: No, he's got it.
Go ahead.
Frank? Frank.
Who was that?
Where are you?
Is this some
kind of joke?
Are you all right?
MICKEY: No, I'm...
FRANK:
Shh! Frank, stop.
Would you just
please listen to me?
They want you
to hear my voice,
that's all that I know.
Good.
You're okay. You're
okay. You did good.
Hello? Hello?
What... Hello?
Mr. Dawson,
how you doing?
And how's Melanie?
We understand
she's got a great bod.
Who the fuck is this?
Tomorrow morning,
you're gonna go
to the Providence Bank & Trust
and draw $1 million
out of your account.
You know what I can tell
you? You're out of
your fucking mind.
Dawson, I think you
better quit talking
and listen
'cause you're
in deep shit, man.
Are you listening?
You draw the one
million in a
cashier's check
and deposit it at
the same bank...
Are you kidding me?
To account number 8950039.
Hello?
You write it down?
No. I don't have a pen.
What are you
gonna do about that?
Get a fucking pen, Frank!
How hard can it be?
Shut up!
Who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?
If you go to the police,
listen to me,
you will never
see your wife again!
You do anything
but put the money
in that account,
She's gone! Plus,
we know about the money!
We know about
Dynamic, Ray Shelby,
the whores on Webster
Avenue! Everything!
I need a pen.
Don't fuck with us!
Write it down!
Who is it?
Slow down!
What am I,
a stenographer?
8950039!
Repeat it back to me!
8950039.
How did it sound?
Shit!
Shit, yeah!
Who was that?
I don't know.
Only thing that...
What?
What's he tell this
Melanie? How tight you
think he is with her?
She ain't
nothing but some ass.
Just some ass.
Don't worry about that.
RICHARD: You fucking bitch!
I'm gonna kill you!
LOUIS: What's going
on up there?
Hey, hey, hey!
Richard!
LOUIS: Fuck!
Richard!
The fuck are you doing!
Put my eye out
with a cigarette.
Shit. How'd she...
You peep through
the walls.
What did you expect?
He thinks he's in
the fucking Gestapo.
RICHARD: Who gave
her those cigarettes?
LOUIS: I did.
Just relax.
Let me take a look.
I'm blind! I can't see!
No, you're good.
ORDELL: Blind?
You got the other eye.
Shut up! Shut up.
I'm cool. I'm cool.
I'll take
a look at it.
Oh, shut up!
ORDELL: Get you some ice.
Just cool out.
Whoa.
Mickey, you okay?
Uh-huh.
Shut up.
So, Richard,
I got a joke for you.
You might like this one.
You too, Louis.
Dude goes to
the doctor, right?
Doctor says,
"Sir, you have to
stop masturbating."
Patient goes, "Why?"
Doctor goes,
"Because I'm
trying to examine you."
Oh, what's the matter?
What, that too close to home?
All right, how about this one?
A nigger, a Jew and a Nazi
get in a Volkswagen...
I got some food for you.
I got chicken
and noodles
cooked in chicken soup
with onions and
some other things.
Looks pretty good.
You got your mask on?
Can't tell.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
You can turn around.
It doesn't matter.
Oh, come on!
No! Take it off!
Don't look.
I used that tape
to cover up
the hole in the wall.
You guys are gonna
have to get your kicks
another way, okay.
You don't have to
worry about that.
We'll cover the holes.
MICKEY: What is
wrong with that guy?
He's disgusting.
He stinks.
Yeah. Well,
he's got a few problems,
but who hasn't, right?
Shit.
What are you
gonna do to me?
Your son, he didn't
go with him, did he?
No, he went to Florida.
Yeah.
You know your
husband has a girl
with him down there.
No.
You never suspected it?
No.
You guys get along all right?
Why?
I'm just asking.
Most men, they go away,
they pick up something.
It isn't unusual.
How do you know that?
I can't tell you.
You know about his
personal bank account
in Freeport?
Hey.
Face forward.
I know he does
business down there.
I would assume that...
With over
a million in it?
How do you know that?
We know.
Maybe that's...
It's 50 grand a month
he's been taking
out of his apartments
in Detroit and
putting it away.
FRANK:
I put about 40
grand worth of materials
and appliances in it
and have it
reappraised for 200 grand.
Wow.
Okay. Now, I've only
put 10% down, right?
And the 40 grand of
materials actually only
really cost me about
four or five grand.
But I'm writing off
depreciation on...
Two hundred grand.
Right.
And on the rentals,
I only declare 60% occupancy.
And that's
all paid in cash.
Jeez.
You're a genius, baby.
Somehow, though,
these guys that called,
they know about this.
What's fucked up here,
besides the obvious,
is here you are
filing for divorce,
and then this happens.
Not wanting to be married,
but, I mean, gosh,
don't want anything awful
to happen to her, either.
Yeah. Yeah, right.
I mean, you may pay
the million bucks,
and they still might...
I mean, let me rephrase
that. You still might not
see her again, honey.
Or if I couldn't
get to the bank
for some reason
and didn't make
the payment on
time, then what?
Do you know what?
We don't even know if
she's alive or dead.
We know she's alive.
I talked to her on the phone.
But was that
really her?
That was her.
It was definitely her.
Gosh, I don't know.
I mean,
we could call their bluff
and see what happens.
No, I can't do that.
No, we can't do that.
It's too risky.
Yeah.
Huh?
I mean,
they might be bluffing.
Although, let's put
ourselves in their place.
Where would you be
if she were dead?
Where would I be
if she was dead?
Where would you be
if she were dead?
Where would I be?
Not you, sweetie.
I mean, where would they
be if she were dead?
You mean if I were them?
Yeah.
Where would you be
if she were dead?
Hello, Mr. Taylor.
Welcome back.
Rodney, have you seen
Mr. or Mrs. Dawson
the last few days?
Frank and Mickey?
Not since Sunday night.
Mickey either?
No, sir.
MAN:
I think perhaps
a woman's been taken.
She's a family friend.
Her name is Mickey.
Marsh!
Just a
minute, please.
Marshmallow,
what are you doing here?
Just making
a phone call.
Dad, why aren't
you at work?
Would you stop that?
Your father's on the phone.
MAN:
PAMELA: Why?
What am I doing?
Just be clear
about what you want
so I can understand you.
I would like you to
stop bouncing your ball
against the door so
I can talk to Daddy.
Please.
MAN:
Okay, that'd be great.
You almost
finished in there?
Where'd you learn
to bandage like this?
The Navy.
You were a doctor?
No, I was the one
getting bandaged.
Oh.
Now this is what you
do? Kidnap people?
No, you're my first.
Ow.
All right.
Hey! Hey!
Put the mask on!
Jesus!
I've already...
I've already seen you.
With both of my eyes.
At the country club.
Okay?
Come on.
Oh, my...
Oh, my gosh.
Wow. Oh, my God.
What, you
don't like history?
I hear this stuff's
worth a lot of money,
what I'm told.
When am I going home?
He hasn't paid yet.
Can I ask how much
are you asking for?
A million.
A million dollars?
He's got it.
I told you that.
Unless you can think of
a reason he won't pay.
God.
Oh, gosh, a million dollars.
It's just not
gonna happen.
What do you mean?
He's got it.
I told you that.
Oh, God.
Tell me more about
those apartments.
Should I get it?
Should we get it?
Do you want me to get it?
Maybe you should get it.
I can get it.
I got it.
Mr. Dawson's residence.
How can I help you?
ORDELL:
I'm afraid Mr. Dawson
isn't here right now.
Would you care to
leave a message?
Actually, Mr.
Dawson left the island
this morning on a boat
and didn't mention
when he'd be back.
Have a good day.
I used to be
a receptionist for
this PR guy in LA.
The guy was a real
asshole, but actually
I made a lot of
interesting friends.
So it was a good
experience
overall, I mean.
What did he say?
He didn't really
say anything.
He just asked for you,
and then he said he
knew you were here.
How would he know that?
He's just guessing.
He doesn't know shit.
Motherfucker.
Call again.
Well, what happen when
I call and she don't
put him on again?
How the fuck we look then?
I'll call him.
Don't get cute.
This shit is not a game.
Then I'll call.
I got it! I got it!
Shit is not a game, ma'am.
I'll get it. I'll get it!
I'm getting it!
Sit down,
Frank! Sit!
Hello.
Yeah, put the man on.
I can't very well put
him on if he's not here,
now, can I, sport?
Who this? This Melanie
with the big titties?
Well, yes, it is,
and who am
I speaking to?
You tell Frank
that if he want to
speak to his wife again,
he need to get on
the phone right now.
Well, he can't get on
the phone right now,
'cause he's not here.
He knew my name.
What'd he want?
Didn't really say
anything. He just
wanted to talk to you.
He sounded
like a black guy.
Well, I might
know the guy,
recognize his voice.
Maybe I should
get it next time.
Mmm-mmm.
You don't have
anything to say,
Frank, do you?
You know what I'm thinking?
What?
Unplug the phone.
Officer?
Sir.
Live in these premises?
I'm a friend of the
family. Is there
a problem, Officer?
Oh.
No.
Just, uh...
You know,
doing an investigation
into a possible burglary
in the neighborhood.
Uh...
You hear any
disturbances lately?
Well, maybe.
Not personally, but no.
I really don't think so.
Those suits were mine.
Uh-huh.
Love these Furies.
My friend lives here,
Frank Dawson.
Who?
Frank Dawson.
He asked me to stop
by and walk his dog.
That's why I'm here.
Really?
What, uh...
That's a...
What happened to
your head there?
A car accident.
Damn buck jumped out at me.
I'm, uh...
I'm gonna have to ask you...
What happened to your eye?
I'm gonna have to ask
you to turn off the car.
Why?
I said turn off the car.
Why?
Step out of the vehicle.
Turn off the car.
Step out of
the goddamn vehicle!
Ow, ow.
Oh!
I don't know.
I had a feeling, but
you're the one had it first.
Somebody that you
hadn't planned on,
you didn't know about.
She's down there
picking up that phone.
We're not gonna
get through to him.
So we know they're up there,
but what are they saying?
Checking our temperature,
that's what they doing.
Seeing if we serious.
We should go down there,
show him something.
Like his wife's fingers.
Just like maybe
the wedding ring finger.
He already knows we got her.
No. No.
We need to make
an impression.
They think it's a game.
Hey, he knows.
It's just a lot of money.
It's not a decision
you make in an hour.
It's been two days,
Louis, going on three.
Her time is up.
Hey.
Don't start no shit
you can't finish, Louis.
You need to calm
down. You're not
thinking this through.
What you think we
doing here? We ain't
boosting no car.
We took a woman.
Now what? You want
to be nice?
Oh, you got some
other shit on your mind.
LOUIS: Fuck you.
Fuck you!
It ain't about what
you feel. It's about
what you're gonna do.
How you handle yourself
in a situation like this.
The man want to
take his time, and
the woman wanna hang
up the phone on us.
The fuck we
supposed to do?
Come on, man.
Stop touching me!
Either he cares
what happens to her,
or he doesn't give a shit!
Finger isn't
gonna do anything!
LOUIS: He gives us
the finger, tells us to
shove it up our ass!
I'm not disagreeing with you.
You're right.
We need to find
a way to put him
against the wall.
So, we go down
there and leave
Richard here with her?
I thought
about it, too.
Yeah, and what
you think?
You go.
I'll stay. You got Cedric.
I think one of us
has gotta stay here,
not just Richard.
In fact,
I'm gonna insist on it.
All right, that's
cool. I'll go.
Me and Cedric got it.
You gonna be all right,
just you and Richard here?
Yeah, we get along,
if I don't have
to talk to him.
You all right, man?
Look like you got
things on your mind.
You worried about something?
Oh, no, I'm not
worried about anything.
Never been
happier in my life.
Ah!
Do you mind? It's my bag.
No, I don't, actually.
All right.
Well, you can take my money,
my Coppertone, and Kleenex,
but leave my driver's license.
Took me months to get.
Melanie.
Is he upstairs?
Or did he leave the island?
Oh.
ORDELL: Yeah. "Oh."
Help! I can't swim!
Help!
Please!
You want to tell
us where he at now?
Yes! Please!
Ta-da.
Abracadabra.
You want a drink?
Yeah, screwdriver.
Coming right up.
Why don't you give
him a call, sweetie?
All right. I got
something to tell you first.
Think it's gonna
mess up your scam,
but don't blame me, okay?
It's the timing.
What timing?
He filed for divorce
two days before
he came down here.
When she gets back,
if she gets back,
the divorce papers
are waiting for her.
Huh.
You tell him
he's never gonna
see his wife again.
He doesn't want to
see his wife again.
You just saved him
maybe 100 grand
a year in alimony.
He said that to you?
He didn't have to.
I know him.
You told him not to go to
the cops, so he won't.
And legally,
he's not supposed to
deal with extortionists.
So he's in the free and clear.
So we just let her go home?
And then he goes
home and gets divorced,
but where does that leave you?
Look, I'm willing
to cooperate with you
'cause I like you.
I feel bad for you.
Aw, you do?
And I don't want to end up
in the fucking ocean again.
Cooperate how?
What about if you...
You disappeared
for 100 grand?
A hundred grand?
A hundred thousand.
I think that's a good
choice for you right now.
It ain't a million.
No, but it's not
a sack of wet shit either.
Do you want my help?
Listen, you're not
getting a million
bucks from him.
You couldn't even get
it out of the country.
All I'm saying
is quit dreaming
and get realistic.
You might as
well get something.
But if she were dead,
I could get you more.
Oh.
Yeah. "Oh."
Hello.
I'll get him.
Don't kid me.
No. I'm not kidding you.
I'm not kidding you at all.
Yeah, we all set.
Now Louis upstairs, yeah?
He's fucking us
by fucking her.
But, you know, I go up there,
and they're not doing it.
I need you to take
the lady home tonight.
Richard, listen to me, man.
Listen very carefully.
Uh-huh.
You tell Louis
to follow you.
You take
the woman in the house.
You put her in the closet.
You lock her up.
Richard?
Huh, what?
You got to do it
without Louis knowing, too.
When he's gone,
I need you to go
back to the house.
I need you
to kill the lady.
I do?
She knows
who you are, man.
She told you that?
She heard your name,
she saw your face.
That's what the Jew
lady told me, man.
You know,
I wondered about that. I did.
I wondered about that.
I don't want to see you,
I don't want to see
nobody go to jail
behind this, man.
So, you know,
you gotta take
the Jew lady out.
But listen.
You cannot tell Louis.
You know something?
I knew she was a Jew.
I could tell.
Yeah, I know. Get a car.
What else did he say?
I told you.
I mean his
exact words.
His exact words were,
"It's all set."
What does that mean?
Why didn't he
ask to talk to me?
Because he said
I could tell you.
It was all set about
taking the woman home,
about you going
and getting a car,
about you putting
her in the trunk.
That's all he
goddamn said, man!
What are you
getting mad for?
I ain't mad.
It's just when I say
something, it's the truth.
Yeah. That's cool,
Richard. Nothing to be
upset about, man.
I just wanna make
sure I understand it.
You know what I mean?
He said it's all set
and he had the money.
Ah.
I must have missed
that part. He did
get the money.
Good. See,
I was wondering
about that.
Where you going?
To get a car, like he said.
Line up
transportation for tonight.
I'll be back in a half-hour.
LOUIS:
You're going home.
When?
Later on.
He paid you?
We're gonna drop you
home in a little bit.
Wait a second. Wait.
My husband paid you?
I guess he must have.
But you're not sure.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Eat your dinner.
It's ham and cabbage
with creamed corn.
No. Something's not right.
I don't believe you.
I gotta go downstairs.
I'll be back.
Wait a second. Listen.
Are you gonna kill me?
No.
Come on.
I will not say a word.
I will not go to the police.
I won't say anything.
Won't help your
husband any.
Wait!
This doesn't happen this way!
Mickey, take it easy.
I say you're going home,
you're going home.
MAN: Thank you.
Great meal as always.
Hey, kid. That's me
over there, black
Chevelle, white stripe.
Just a sec, boss.
Be careful with it.
Oh, God.
Didn't eat your ham.
No, I didn't.
I wasn't hungry.
I forgot.
You're not allowed to eat it.
Sorry. Why am I not
allowed to eat it?
Your religion.
If you want to call it that.
What?
He tell you? Louis?
You're going home.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, he did.
He told me.
So I guess
you guys got
your money, huh?
I'm gonna miss
you around here.
It's been
such a lovely time.
What?
What'd you say?
Nothing.
I didn't say anything.
What'd you say?
Nothing.
Huh?
No.
Please,
please, no!
Kiss me. Kiss me.
No! No!
You don't like me?
Please, no!
Kiss me. Kiss me!
What, I'm not good
enough for you?
Please. Please.
Take your clothes off.
Take them off,
or I will rip them off!
Stop!
Now the brassiere.
Do it. Do it.
Hey!
Huh?
What's going on up there?
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!
Okay!
Let's go. Come on.
This way.
Hold on.
You all right?
No.
You shot?
No.
7-442.
WOMAN:
Yeah, I'm at 1,000 block,
State and Fair,
east of Woodward.
Requesting
immediate backup.
I got some
wild-looking asshole
here firing a handgun.
Where are you taking me?
Where am I taking you?
I'm taking you home.
Right here,
this stretch of Northwood,
where it used to be called
the street-racing
capital of the world.
I don't want to go home.
ORDELL: So that's
the Florentine, huh?
What else you got?
Listen, Ordell,
we got a minor problem.
Actually, we've got
some good news and
some not such good news.
Had a feeling
you had some news.
He's going back tomorrow.
He's leaving.
And now that he's
out of the casino
and back on the wagon,
he's in a pretty good place,
all things considered.
That's the
not-so-good news.
He wants to get back,
make an appearance,
see his wife,
call off the divorce,
but he wants me to come back
to Detroit with him.
I just reminded him
that I'm the only person
he has to talk to about this,
you know,
the sympathetic listener.
This is the good news?
Well, the bad
isn't exactly bad
and the good isn't
exactly sensational.
But what it does
do is it gets
things back to normal.
You've got little
Mickey back with hubby,
assuming she's alive.
Oh, which reminds me,
you should really
call your friend.
It actually gives you
time to set this up
and do it right.
I mean, you're a hunk,
but you are
a piss-poor extortionist,
if you don't mind me saying.
Let's be honest.
This could've been set
up a whole lot better.
This motherfucker's
got way too many guns
and from what I can tell,
no shortage of ammo.
When we first saw him,
he had on
a T-shirt and long johns,
armed with a revolver.
Now he got on some
kind of damn uniform.
Busted in all
the windows,
except the ones
boarded up on
the second floor.
Did he say anything?
He keeps saying
something about
the Fury or
the  maybe.
I don't know.
It wasn't making much
sense, and he was crying
through most of it.
Okay.
Ray, where
you going?
MAN:
Get back!
Take cover! Take cover!
Hey.
What?
Louis?
Smoked grass,
and I'm drinking beer.
And I don't
even like beer.
And that pizza,
it was delicious.
Jesus Christ.
How did you know my name?
Oh.
The fat guy told me,
that fake police guy.
He's not
a real cop, right?
He told you?
Yeah. He did.
You know,
I was thinking
about something else.
Yeah?
The other guy,
the black one.
Oh, "The black one."
Yeah.
Everyone knows everyone.
That's good.
He went down to
Freeport, right?
'Cause I haven't
heard his voice
for a couple of days.
Where is he now?
He just called this afternoon.
He's still there,
on his way back.
He called,
but you didn't speak to him.
The other guy
spoke to him, right?
Because when I asked you
if my husband had paid you,
you said, "I think so."
Yeah. Richard told me,
so I didn't talk to him.
Richard. Is that that
guy's name? That fat
guy's name's Richard?
That's right,
but I'll tell you something.
You need to forget everything
that you have seen and heard
over the last few days.
Louis, you're not sure
if your partner was paid.
Oh, God, a million dollars?
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.
Hmm.
Louis.
Yeah?
I think I'm
ready to go home now.
Okay.
TYRA: Two days
before her recital,
Shelly asked me
if she can quit.
I'd try and
talk her out of it,
but I know she's scared.
We just had to
do the same thing
with Andrew.
Taking him out
of private school.
Too much pressure.
TYRA: I think it
sends the wrong message.
But I asked Marsh,
and he says,
"It's a ballet recital.
Who friggin' cares?"
That was really helpful.
Thanks, Marsh.
Where you been
all week, celebrity?
I was kidnapped.
What you
thinking about?
Mickey!
How are you?
Oh, my God.
I'm fine.
You know, I've been
worried sick about you.
Mick, what happened?
Did you even
try to find out?
When I didn't hear
anything, of course I did.
I tried to call you.
I came by.
I looked for you
at the club.
Mmm-hmm.
You look good.
Marshall, there is
a hole in my closet door
the size of you.
Jesus, I know.
Maybe if we hurry up,
we can get it fixed.
The suits,
I came by and took them in.
They're all clean.
Marshall, do you even know
where I've been all week?
Mickey, listen.
Talk.
I'll pick up the suits.
You call a guy about the door.
All right.
I think I'll just let
you and Frank handle it.
What do you mean?
Frank? Mickey.
Roll down the window.
Just for one second.
You all right?
I'm fine.
You want a drink?
Sure.
When'd you get back?
I just walked in.
Oh, you mean the flight.
Did you stop and see
Bo on your way back?
Way back?
No. Didn't
have the time.
There's been
a few problems
on that Grandview job.
All the sod that
was supposed to be
in a month ago?
I come back, none of
the landscaping is done.
Unbelievable.
Or would you
rather talk about golf?
You asked me why
I didn't see Bo.
I'm telling you.
Did you pay them?
Didn't have to.
They backed off.
When did they back off?
When I wouldn't pay them.
It was a bluff.
I called it.
That's all.
What if they
weren't bluffing?
But they were.
What the hell's
wrong with you?
What if they
weren't bluffing, Frank?
Okay, you're getting
a little hysterical here.
I told them
right from the start
I wasn't gonna pay.
Okay.
Did you go to the police?
No. I couldn't.
They said if I did...
That's when they
threatened your life.
But I thought they
were bluffing, honey.
This isn't
simple to explain.
Okay.
At first,
I didn't do anything.
And then I knew,
as soon as I talked
to them again,
I knew that
they'd back off.
And that there wasn't
really anything
serious to worry about.
Other than, of course,
what you went through.
I imagine
it was a pretty
frightening experience.
You're not gonna tell me.
But I know what you did,
you know what you did,
and that's all that
matters, isn't it? So...
Isn't it?
I got the divorce papers.
They were waiting
for me when I got home.
Now, obviously they
were sent way before
I knew anything
about a kidnapping.
Are you
gonna marry her?
Listen, instead of
discussing what
I feel is personal,
I think it was Henry
Kissinger that said,
"Never complain.
Never explain."
That was Henry Ford,
when he was
arrested for drunk
driving in California
with another
woman in his car.
So...
What do I get?
What's my part
of the settlement?
Well, we sell the house,
split the equity.
It's about 200,000,
plus alimony, child support.
And then we divide the
money you're sneaking into
the Freeport account?
There is no Freeport
bank account in my name
and there is no possible
way anyone can prove it.
You want to look in my books?
Mmm-mmm.
No, but I would like to see
your apartment buildings.
Your refrigerators, ranges,
all of your appliances.
How you save money
on stolen materials.
How do you know about that?
And how you pay
your old buddy Ray
Shelby to front you.
And without even
getting into the kidnapping,
I could stir up enough
to just nail your ass.
Look, I don't know
what you think you know.
Couldn't I?
I mean, if I was
the type of person
that wanted to
see you go to jail.
Frank.
What?
Are you gonna marry...
What's her name?
I hope to.
You mean if you
don't go to jail.
No, that's not what I meant.
Oh, we're
just wasting time.
Let's wait till
I get a lawyer.
Fine.
But before you get
an expensive divorce lawyer,
just know it comes
out of the settlement.
Just so much in
the kitty, kitty.
Watch it.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
Did they
take advantage of you or...
Mmm-mmm.
Something happened to you.
You're different.
Hey.
Finally changed your
clothes. You look nice.
Fancy pants.
These are my culottes.
Well, they're pretty cool.
And no bra?
I have one on.
I have more than one bra.
Anyway, I gotta
tell you somethin'.
Hear that?
What?
"I gotta tell you
somethin'." I sound like you.
I say that?
Anyway,
what I was gonna say was,
I didn't come for this bra.
I just... I needed somebody
to talk to, and, you know...
Is it all right that
I just invited myself?
Yeah, sure.
Sure, it is,
but there's one problem.
See, I was trying
to talk to my husband
finally and...
Wait. What problem?
Oh, Ordell is back.
I know that.
Yeah, but he's not alone.
ORDELL: They
expressing themselves.
MELANIE:
Hello, Mickey.
Ordell.
Oh, please.
Make yourself comfortable.
Have a seat.
I just was in
the neighborhood,
thought I'd stop by,
say hi to the old gang.
Oh, no, we ain't
no gang. We just,
you know, some folks.
Uh.
Mickey, meet Melanie.
Melanie, Mickey.
Hi.
Hi.
ORDELL: How's Frank?
Frank's great.
Guys, what's
going on? Mickey?
Louis, who's
your friend?
I thought you two
were introduced.
Melanie, Mickey.
Bullshit.
Mickey says her old
man's divorcing her.
Really?
MICKEY: Mmm.
And I don't want to
interfere with his new life.
Mine, either.
This is the part
where I say what?
What, you don't believe me?
MELANIE: Uh-uh.
Do you want me to
describe the apartment
in Freeport?
Ordell's been there.
All right.
Well, how about the
birthmark two inches from
the base of his spine?
Assuming, of course,
that you've been there.
I gotta take a leak.
Just sit still. Sit still.
Hold on. Hmm.
Now the woman said
that the man is
gonna divorce her.
He's not coming back.
He don't want to
make a new start.
Mmm-mmm.
ORDELL: Hmm.
So I got it wrong,
baby. I mean,
I can't help if he
tells her one thing
and then tells me another.
Or if she's pissed.
Are you mad at anybody?
No, not at all.
No, she's not mad.
This is bullshit.
Would you mind terribly?
MICKEY: Hmm.
There she goes,
future Mrs. Dawson.
She looks like
a million bucks.
Did he tell you he
was gonna marry her?
Mmm-hmm.
And live with
her until he does.
Hmm.
Hmm!
MELANIE: You know, guys,
I was thinking we
should call Frank
and then we'd all be together.
ORDELL: Yeah.
Sure.
Let's call
the motherfucker.
