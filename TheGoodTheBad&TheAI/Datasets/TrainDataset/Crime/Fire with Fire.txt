What's he doing in there?
I thought he was right behind us?
He's getting something
for the bar owner.
He's getting
something for the bar owner?
I think I see him.
Whoa!
Mission accomplished.
- Here you go, sir.
- No no no.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
That's an expensive case of Scotch.
- Merry Christmas, guys.
- Merry Christmas to you.
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks, man, thanks.
So what do you guys say?
Happy hour my place 6:00 a.m.?
- Whool
- Let's go!
Yeah. Thanks.
Let's do this.
I'm gonna throw this up front.
I'm sorry your night got mined.
Hopefully this makes
you feel a little better.
She was cute!
Look at you.
Jeremy Coleman-
one-man community outreach program.
Don't say it!
Okay, I don't want to hear it.
Let's just try and give this
one more than a couple weeks.
Just because you've been domesticated
doesn't mean I want to be domesticated.
I need you to get domesticated.
We need another couple to hang out with.
Ooh, another exciting night
of Pictionary? No thank you, I'm good.
Pictionary, Charades,
some fuckin' Boggle--
Yourjabbering is delaying
my drinking. Let's get mobile.
I'm right behind you.
Let's do this.
We gotta stop by the store,
get provisions.
Hey, what are you
doing for Christmas?
What do I do every Christmas?
I'm picking up a shift.
We're having dinner with Maria's family.
You're invited.
- She insists.
- Thank you, really,
but I like working the holidays.
- Let's go.
- Of course.
Weeest, y'all can
accept it or not
Fools thinkin' Dub S
left wit 'Pac
Weeest, still in tha 4s
and the 'lacs--
Hey hey hey.
Grab me some--
Stop! Before you ask for whatever shit
you're about to ask for,
- remember, 15-year-old Scotch.
- That means it's good, Craig.
I understand now, fellows.
Thank you.
- Grab me a double bag of Funyuns.
- Fuck.
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on.
If I'm not mistaken, we're about
to drink this upscale booze
in plastic cups in your shitty apartment
at 7:00 in the morning,
so ease up off the sommelier shit
- and grab me some fucking Funyuns!
- You're disgusting.
Hey, we'll be across
the street getting gas. All right?
And some black licorice, Jeremy!
I like my licorice
like I like my women.
Don't discriminate, Jeremy!
- Yo, Jeremy! What's up, man?
- Morning, fellas!
You don't have to straighten up for me,
Calvin, that's all right.
You know I'm playing in that
holiday tournament tomorrow night.
- You better show up this time.
- I'll be there, hey, I'll be there.
I promise.
Hey, Pringles 3-pointer-- hit me.
- Whool
- Look at that kid.
And that's why
the college scouts keep calling.
It's looking like a full ride now.
Hell, they might even take me.
Yeah right, Dad.
Keep dreaming.
So you've been out
rescuing cats from trees?
Yeah, something like that.
Hey, when are you gonnajoin up?
Yeah right,
maybe the Second Coming.
How you doing, fellas?
La-di-da.
Help you with something?
Keep your nose
on the floor, you fucker!
Settle down.
- Now!
Okay okay.
Don't you do nothin'.
Okay.
Why don't you come out
from around the counter?
Get on your knees right here!
Get your nose on the fuckin' ground.
Get on your knees!
Kneel down.
Now my man that came
in here last week,
he told you I wanted your store.
Now you told him that
you weren't gonna give up the lease.
I told him I was sorry
but this is a good location for us.
Yeah, I know it's a good location.
- It's got freeways.
- Yeah.
Easy to move packages in and out.
I know it.
This whole neighborhood
belongs to the Eastside Crips.
Eastside Crips.
Look, I have to pay them
every month.
I'm under their protection.
So it's no disrespect to you,
but that's the reason
you can't do business here.
If you want me to,
I can call them for you.
I mean you can talk
to 'em for yourself.
Look, I'll get my phone.
HQY1 Pllf your chin up!
I was just gettin' my phone.
I mean if you want to,
you can talk to 'em.
I'd like that, yeah.
Yeah, get your phone.
Don't fucking tempt me!
I want to!
Here.
Hey, what's up, cuz?
My name is David Hagan.
I don't care much what yours is.
Listen, you gonna go up
against me, I'll kill you.
I'll kill you and everyone close to you.
- Jesus!
- Calvin!
- No.
- Yeah yeah!
- Oh Jesus, oh Jesus Christ.
- Shut the fuck up.
- Tell him I shot your son.
What did you kill him for?
Come on, Dennis.
Tell him I shot your son.
- Come on, Dennis.
- Oh my God.
Tell him to prove a point
lshot your son.
It'll mean more if you do it.
- Shit.
- Come on, baby, come on.
- Come on, come on.
- Nah.
- No, Dennis!
- Now we're talking.
Hi, I'm back.
Listen, if I want your territory,
I'll take your territory.
It's been nice talking to you.
What about him?
I don't know, genius.
Figure it out.
Fuck.
Oh God damn it!
- Jeremy!
- Jeremy!
Jeremy!
- Oh shit.
- What is it, man?
- Jeremy.
- Call 911.
- Jeremy, are you all right?
- Call 911. They shot Calvin.
- Who?
- They shot Dennis.
Who who who?
Who shot Dennis?
Mike? Mike?
You're gonna want to see this.
- What's the charge?
- Murder in the first.
- Who caught the case?
- Paxson.
I know-- there was
no evidence at the scene,
but there was an eyewitness,
and he's solid--
he was like three feet
away from Hagan.
Please tell me
they didn't fuck this up.
It's a slam dunk even for him.
- It's done.
- Tell Paxson I'm taking over the case.
- When are they making the arrest?
- He's already in the box.
David Hagan, line up.
Let's go.
Lieutenant.
How are you doing, Mike?
Great.
Lieutenant.
Jeremy, hey.
I'm Detective Mike Celia,
District Attorney Sharon Westlake.
Harold Gethers,
criminal attorney.
When you see the man
you saw at the store,
say his number
and he'll step forward
and repeat one
of the phrases you heard.
What he claims to have heard.
It's number four.
Number four, step forward
and repeat the phrase.
Number four,
please step forward.
Yeah.
Jeremy Thomas Coleman.
- Oh my God.
- Social security number:
He lives at-
Okay, for the record
I knew nothing about that.
And what he just said does not
constitute an actual threat.
- Your client just read--
- I believe my client
has not been formally identified.
That's him.
We have a responsibility
to our witness
- and I don't mean procedurally.
- Obviously.
I mean emotionally, morally.
- He ID-'d Hagan.
Jeremy needs to know
who he's testifying against
and he needs to know your end of it.
I'm telling you we're gonna have
to play good cop, bad cop here.
All right, tell me about him.
Local, born and bred; parents died
in a fire when he was eight;
couple of group homes,
some juvie stuff;
entered the fire academy,
only job he's ever had.
- No other family?
- Hm-mmm.
Good.
Makes it easier for us.
See you in a minute.
Hello, Jeremy,
thanks for waiting.
Before Detective Cella
gets here,
I'd like to give you some
background information, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
A few years ago,
after David Hagan tumed
his Aryan following
in San Quentin into a street crew,
Detective Cella
and his partner decided
to go after his organization.
They made cases against
some of these guys.
They wanted them to flip,
to testify for the state.
That didn't work out.
Hagan killed
Detective Celia's partner
and his partner's wife.
You gonna tell him
how the DA's office
- gave up on the case?
- Stop.
That had nothing to do
with this case.
Yeah, and neither does
a half a dozen or so crimes
on Hagan's rap sheet.
- Tell him the truth!
- The truth is...
we can't get Hagan
unless you testify.
The truth is
Hagan is a sociopath.
He is a stone-cold killer.
He doesn't give a fuck.
I will put you
in witness protection.
The feds will keep you safe.
So my whole life just--
just goes away?
You get to keep your first name.
You-- you gotta be
fucking kidding me.
Fucking witness protection.
All right.
I'll do it.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
I'll do it.
Your driver's license,
Mr. Coleman.
Put your bag
on the side please.
Step on through.
Thank you.
You're late.
Come on.
Right through here.
Hey, Mullen.
Mullen, they're here.
Go ahead and patch it in.
Come on in and sit down.
- This is Mike Cella.
- Hey, Lieutenant.
I'm gonna be seeing you soon.
The judge moved the case up.
We go to trial in two weeks.
Oh! Thank God!
I gotta tell you, man,
I am so ready to go home.
I'll be the first to buy
you a beer-- the first of many.
And listen, thank you.
Really thank you, man.
- Take care of yourself, all right?
- Okay.
Congratulations, son.
That's it.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
- Mmm.
- Yes!
Thank you.
Taxi taxi!
What the hell do you
think you're doing?
We're US Marshals, not amateurs.
I know you've been sneaking out
of the apartment we got you
- and coming to this motel.
- I've been--
I've been seeing someone.
What, you couldn't wait
till you got back home
to start hooking up
with random girls?
It-- it's not like that, okay?
Oh.
Is she special?
Yeah.
Very.
Now I'm curious.
So tell me about her.
I said tell me about her!
She's kind of a smartass.
So far I like her
- Yeah?
She likes to run her mouth a lot.
She's beautiful.
She forgets that sometimes.
Mm-hmm.
And when this
whole thing is over,
she's coming back
to Long Beach with me.
She's thinking about it.
It wouldn't be dating
in secret anymore.
You'd finally get to meet
all my idiot friends.
It'd be like a real couple.
Maybe you feel a certain way
about this girl right now,
then when you get back home--
Nah. I know how
I feel about her.
Yeah?
Prove it.
Hiya.
Good evening.
Do you have a reservation?
All I have are crossed fingers.
Well, I'll see what I can do for you.
Good golly, you got some
pretty looking nails there, girl.
Thank you. Some people say
they match my eyes.
That they do.
Well, it looks like you're in luck.
We have vacancies.
It will run you $89,
- which includes tax.
- It includes tax?
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.
- Will it just be you by yourself?
- Actually me and my buddy.
- Okay.
- One room, two beds.
Non-smoking,
a couple of nights.
All right, farther back today.
All right.
All right, go.
Good good.
Better. You're still doing
one thing wrong.
It's what everyone does.
You're anticipating the recoil.
Okay, you're expecting
the gun to kick up,
so you're compensating
by pulling down.
- Okay.
- By the time the gun kicks up,
the bullet's long gone.
Okay, so just forget about the recoil.
It doesn't matter
every single time you pull the trigger.
Put your cans on.
You'd be surprised by
how accurate you can get.
Oh, look at you.
Very cute.
Thank you.
You're right though.
I do hesitate.
It's like every time I get my target
between the crosshairs
I wait a second and then
I start shaking, you know?
You see, but you're not
hitting the target.
The gun is. So you have
to trust the gun.
- Okay.
- Breathe, line up your target
and squeeze.
That's all you do.
Look at that.
Okay, you are now
officially even hotter.
What?
- Kiss me.
- No no no no.
Wait a minute-- another free lesson
and you haven't taught me
anything about firefighting.
Gimme my gun.
Here you go
Well, I don't have my equipment.
And I need a fire, of course.
Come on, tell me something.
I wanna know-- what's your
favorite part about the job,
besides scoring
hot chicks, of course?
That's ridiculous.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah right.
You know, I just love being
part of that group.
Going through all the things you go
through just to become a fireman.
Those guys are my brothers.
I consider them family.
So what's it really like?
I don't know,
most calls are routine.
Every once in a while
you get that--
that call where
all hell's breaking loose
and you got a structure
going up with people inside.
To most people it looks like
a blazing monster, but I understand
how it behaves,
how it progresses,
the airflow, the ventilation,
materials, flashpoints,
construction styles.
I know how to get in,
I know how to get out.
I know where I can go. I know
where I can't go. Things like that.
But to the people inside,
all they see is fire and smoke.
You know?
Just heat and blackness.
And sometimes it happens where
that person who's trapped inside--
they don't wanna go.
They panic, they freeze.
Because where I need
to take them
seems a hell of a lot worse
than the spot where they're still alive.
- So what do you do?
- I get them to focus on me.
I try to get their eyes.
I try to get their full attention,
even through the mask
and the ventilator.
I say the same thing
every time, no matter what,
because it always works. Kind of like
what you taught me back there.
What do you say?
I say "Trust me.
Do everything that I ask
and I promise you'll stay alive today."
I miss it.
So how long do I have
to be in Long Beach
before I can start calling myself
a California girl?
- Oh, here we go.
- Parking karma.
Yeah.
Jeremy, get down!
Stay down, stay down.
No-ooo!
No!
No! Please please!
Two is down, one is up.
It's okay, it's okay.
You'll be okay. Hold on.
I do not have a shot.
Stay with me, stay with me.
Move back.
We're gonna move back, come on.
Come on, come on.
- Darren.
- I'm hit, I'm hit.
Stay down.
Hey hey hey. It's okay.
Oh shit.
Hey hey he?
Stay with me, come on.
Stay here.
Somebody call 911!
Take a deep breath.
What?
The bullet's in deep.
I'm gonna give you more anesthetic.
What's in the shot?
I can't help you.
You need a trauma surgeon,
a full OR with an anesthesiologist.
We're too far from home.
I can't get you those things.
- You emptied it, right?
- Of course I did.
You wanna talk?
No.
You want the light?
No.
Hey, where is she?
Is she okay?
The wounds are superficial.
She's fine.
I need you to have a seat.
Have a seat and listen.
Three days ago, a case manager
at WITSEC headquarters
in DC was killed.
It looked like a mugging.
They took his watch,
took his wedding ring,
wallet, cash.
But as it turns out,
four hours before he died
he accessed your file.
So they paid him for your location
and then they killed him to tie it up.
Now, son,
this will never happen again.
Access to your records
will be restricted
to the executive office of WITSEC.
All your communications
will be double blind.
Full black box.
Go ahead.
These were found
in the shooter's van.
Oh my God.
You gotta be fucking kidding.
Now I'm not judging anybody
not tonight.
I mean,
you're only human.
But why do you think they went
after the both of you?
Hell, you're the witness.
Why not go after you alone?
Because you cared for her.
So the safest thing for both of you
is to be nowhere near one another.
No. No, you need
to let me be with her.
I need to make sure
that she's safe.
- No, she is safe.
- How do you know she's gonna be safe?
She is safe. She's under guard
and wherever she's going--
She's going with me, God damn it!
I need to see her!
Marshal Durham is
on a plane and in the air.
Hell, I don't even know
where it's heading.
And that's for her safety
and for yours!
- What do you mean? She's gone?
- She's gone.
Your new identity is
already being arranged.
When it's done, we'll take you
out of New Orleans.
You've been erased.
You don't exist.
You're a ghost.
But you'll be safe.
When do I get to see her?
Not till after the trial.
You just sit tight.
Hang onto yourself. The case
just bled out all over the street.
There was a hit out on Jeremy,
a federal agent was shot.
- Jeremy Coleman?
- Jeremy's off the grid.
- What federal agent was shot?
- That's all the information I have.
- Who are you talking to?
- The marshals in charge.
All right. Get me on the phone
with them right now.
Lieutenant Cella,
all due respect,
this water's a fair bit deeper
than what you're used to.
You're absolutely right.
I'm just a small-town cop,
so if you could help me
and pick out some small words
and explain to me exactly
how you're gonna protect this guy.
You know I can't provide
you with any details.
Just tell me what kind
of protection you have.
Well, the full weight and resources
of the United States Marshals Service
is being brought to bear.
Yes, I can almost feel it right now.
How about this?
Why don't you just give me the boy?
All right?
He can sleep on my couch.
I got cold beer in the fridge.
I have ESPN on the TV.
I have a 9mm Beretta.
I have a Ruger
Security Six .357 Magnum,
a Remington 86 tactical shotgun.
So you tell Hagan's men
if they wanna get this boy,
they're gonna have
to go through me!
Do you understand that,
you third-grade motherfuckers?
Lieutenant, I realize how much
this case means to you.
How's he doing?
Well, he's better than I expected.
He's a tough kid.
I want you to tell him
something for me, please.
I want you
to tell him that I said I'm sorry.
Did you hear that?
Tell him I said I'm sorry.
You should tell him
you're sorry, too.
I'm sorry to take up so much
of your time, Marshal.
I know that the federal government
really doesn't--
That's what we're doing.
- The unit's open, it's all clear.
- All right.
Why don't you go grab
what you need
and then we'll get you
out of town.
Hello.
My man pulled
your girl's phone records.
Now she dials this number
late at night,
you talk for hours.
See, now you and I,
we never got to talk,
you know, just us.
Yeah, that's a shame.
I'm guessing
you're with the police.
You see,
I can talk to you
in an honest way.
See, in a way they can't.
So let's just--
let's just talk.
Just us, come on.
All right.
It's so simple.
Don't testify
and this will all be over with.
No, it'll be over
once you're sentenced.
You-- you've got--
you've got that
all wrong, see, Jeremy.
See, I go to prison
and I keep running my crew.
I'm gonna keep a contract out
on you and your girlfriend
for as long as it takes.
And this won't be over
until the both of you are dead.
Now-- now that can
happen anywhere.
Yeah.
Let me see.
How about
Monticello, Indiana?
At the lake house,
where your girl's family
has reunions.
I think the next one's in July.
I can't wait to go to that one.
Hey, when are the two
of you getting married?
I bet that's gonna be
a special day, huh?
You gonna invite all your
family and friends...
Craig, Adam,
Trey!
Carlos...
and how about
a couple of my guys?
Or maybe I'll just wait.
You know,
maybe I'll just wait for years
until you and your girl,
you got some kids of your own.
Then my men..
They'll come and kill them
while you watch.
You see, what you don't
understand, Jeremy, is...
prison time
ain't nothing but time.
Now you wanna live
the rest of your life
knowing that one day--
one day, son,
I will find you?
No, you're not gonna touch her.
I'll kill you before I let that happen.
Look,
testify, don't testify,
you're both dead anyway.
That's just for talking back.
No, you listen to me,
you son of a bitch, you're dead.
You hear me?
You are fucking dead.
You tell me exactly how someone
like you's gonna kill me.
Because I'm a ghost.
I don't exist.
I'm gonna find you.
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna disappear
and nobody will ever know.
To hell with witness protection.
You're gonna need
protection from me.
I'm gonna need protection from you?
Oh shit!
I'm gonna need
protection from you.
Shit.
Fuck. Oh fuck. Fuck.
Lost
You've been
so lost to me
And the cost
It's killed me
to set you free
But I...
Why don't you go hurry him up?
Just can't stand
to lose you now
- No, I...
- Jeremy?
Just can't stand
To lose you now...
How we doing?
Jeremy?
Ah
Hey! He's running!
Hey!
- He's running!
- Stay off the radios!
Find him,
but we've gotta keep this quiet
for his own protection!
Shit!
I can't stand
To lose you now
I...
Can't stand
to lose you now
I...
Can't stand
to lose you now
No, I...
Can't stand to lose
You now...
That's truly horrifying.
Thank God Mr. Coleman
survived these hideous
acts of random violence.
How do you say that shit
with a straight face?
Your Honor?
The police are executing
search warrants right now
on Hagan and all of his people.
I'm confident those warrants
will prove fruitless.
Come on,
physical proof or not,
basic common sense says that
Hagan needs to be locked up.
Your Honor, I'm asking you
to revoke that bail order.
Your Honor,
may I speak plainly?
If there was someone out there,
operating independently of my client,
attempting to bring harm
to Mr. Coleman,
incarcerating my client
will do nothing to prevent that.
In the absence
of actual evidence of any sort,
all you'd be doing,
with due respect, Your Honor,
is demonstrating extreme prejudice
and providing me
with grounds for appeal
of any future conviction,
not to mention
grounds for a complete dismissal.
Now in regards to that,
I welcome such an action.
By all means, lock him up.
Saw some robberies
and could be some missing bodies
Another killing hat,
someone paying for this murder rap
Fuck the Jimmy shit...
Man, who's this Wonder-Bread-lookin'
motherfucker walkin' around?
Hey, can I talk
to you guys for a second?
You in the wrong
neighborhood, cuz.
- I'm not looking for trouble.
- Nah, fuck that, man.
You ought to get you a hat
that says "Undercover Cop."
- I'm not a cop.
- You better not be, motherfucker,
'cause you fucking suck at it.
Keep on walking, cuz,
you gonna scare off
my customers and shit.
I am a customer.
All right?
I want a gun.
Gun store, homie.
I want a gun that can't be traced.
Look here, cuz.
- We don't sell steel to white boys.
- I'm not looking for any--
Jesus.
God, oh!
See what the fuck you did?
Trying to tell your ass.
Now you done fuck with the muscle.
Put your teeth on the curb, man.
Hey, cuz, let me
"American History X" this boy.
I always wanted to do that.
- I'm not a cop!
- Shut the fuck up!
L-- I need the gun
to kill David Hagan.
I wanna kill David Hagan.
Don't fuck with me, boy.
Let's take a ride, cuz.
Hey, Wonder Bread,
get your ass up.
I got it.
Get your ass in the car.
No, fool, not the back seat.
Get your ass in the trunk.
I can ride in the back
fucking seat, man.
Get your ass
in the motherfucking trunk!
Put this on.
You'll get there safe--
just in the dark.
Lamar!
Lamar!
We got company.
Welcome to the Eastside.
Yeah. Why you ain't up
in Bixby Knolls?
- Problems at the country club?
- I ain't from Bixby Knolls.
You sure as fuck
ain't from here either.
So we got a white boy
who wants to smoke Hagan.
- Ain't this a bitch?
- It's a long story, but it's him or me.
- And who are you?
- Nobody, cuz.
That's right.
Nobody, literally nobody.
But if I do pull this off,
Hagan'll be gone,
and you guys can take the credit.
I know that he's competition for you.
I could be doing you guys a favor.
Pffft.
Stone cold Bixby!
Man, fuck this shit, man.
He wasting your fuckin' time, nigga.
Let us take him
out the back, cuz. Trust me.
Naw. He's a customer.
C'mon.
What a selection.
Now what you trying to do, man,
you gonna need
- some motherfuckin' weight. Trust me.
- The Glock 21.
- The Glock 21?
- Yeah.
You hear this white motherfucker?
Glock 21, man, you could've got
this shit from Kmart, man!
From aisle one
next to the Pampers!
Look at this motherfucker,
take a look at that shit.
We got AK-47s over here, dawg.
- I don't know how to shoot the AK-47.
- Check this shit out, man.
You tryin' to be the motherfucking
Grim Reaper and shit?
- You gonna have to get grim.
- I learned how to shoot on this gun.
- Fuck that.
- I learned how to fuck
on this dumb bitch
at the rec center.
Her grill all fucked up,
teeth sideways,
throwing gang signs
and titties hanging 'em out.
Man, I'm hard bangin' that shit, man,
but then I upgraded.
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Hey, shut the fuck up!
Enough of that shit, all right?
Can I?
Can this be traced?
No, it can't be
motherfuckin' traced.
The shit ain't even been fired.
The serial number's been filed out.
That's virgin steel.
Hey, look, now you wondering
if I think you can kill Hagan?
I don't know
what the fuck you can do.
But I think you could be trouble.
You could occupy some of his time.
Even if it's only 30 minutes when he
gain' somewhere to drop off your body.
Bullets are on the house.
Give it to him.
I hope you got some gas money left
in them motherfuckin' pockets
of yours, motherfucker.
Jeremy?
Yeah, I had a feeling
you'd answer this phone.
I wasn't supposed to, but...
I knew you'd call.
How are you?
I'm a little woozy,
a little tired, but...
I'm fine.
I'm just sad I missed
all your heroics.
That's all right.
It'll give me a chance
to exaggerate it later.
Jeremy?
You have to come back in.
I know that things got bad,
but you can't be
out there on your own.
So wherever it is that you are,
please just go to a police station
and tell them to call the marshals.
Okay? You're not safe.
But you are safe.
That's the only thing
that matters to me.
Whatever happens,
I want you to know that.
Please don't do this to me.
Jeremy?
I love you.
Get rid of this phone.
I'm not gonna call you again.
No, Jeremy»
- What'd I fucking tell you?
- Oh shit.
For fuck's sake!
Talk to him tomorrow.
He's working at the Obispo.
Right there.
Hands up!
Jeremy fucking Coleman.
You throw it away.
Throw your fuckin' gun!
Calm down.
Calm yourself down.
- Around the corner.
- What?
Get around the fucking corner!
- It's Gethers.
- Hold on.
All right. Later.
What's up?
He wants to talk about
your plea bargain.
Oh, he does?
Let's go run an errand.
- Go to the fuckin' corner!
- This is a fuckin' big mistake.
Shut the fuck up and get
against the wall.
All right. Sit down.
Back against the wall!
Okay, now what?
I'm gonna kill Hagan.
- Is that so?
- That's right.
What's "Obispo"?
Who's gonna be there?
Throw me your phone.
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a boxer.
I worked and worked,
but then I realized
it wasn't gonna happen,
because I didn't have it in me.
You tell me how to get to Hagan.
Now you wanna be
some badass assassin,
but you haven't got it in you.
Dude, I will shoot you
in the fucking knee
if you don't tell me how to get
to Hagan. Do you understand me?
Henry Cooper had 4% body fat.
Now do I look like
I've got 4% body fat?
No. And you ain't gonna
pull that fucking trigger!
Fuck!
Wait wait! Fuck!
Ah, so you're one of those, huh?
Wait please.
Whoo. Come on.
What you got there? What you got?
Whoo-ee!
Oh shit. Fuck.
Fuck.
The Aryan brother
is without care.
He walks where the weak
and the heartless won't dare.
For the Aryan brother, death holds
no fear.
Vengeance will be his...
through his brothers
still there.
Oh shit, oh shit.
Throw your weapons out!
If you're hurt, I can help you,
but you gotta throw out
your weapons!
George, please tell me
that's not a dead guy.
- It's a dead guy.
- Are you fucking kidding me?
It's a terrible tragedy, huh?
It's a fucked up weekend
is what it is.
Fuck. Who is this?
Looks like he gotjumped and his buddies
in the SUV down there,
they came riding to the rescue,
but I'm pretty sure it didn't work out.
- What is that shit carved in his face?
- It's E.C., Eastside Crips.
This is gang retaliation.
Yeah. Yeah yeah,
what do you got for me?
- Hey, Lieutenant?
- Hey, what's up?
- I thought you should see this.
- What is it?
Partial print.
It's not much, but I think
- we can get a hit off of it.
- All right.
Take this to the lab.
Get the results back to me.
- Only me.
- Only you.
Thanks, Paul.
- Hello?
- Lieutenant Cella.
- Who is this?
- I think it's time we met
face to face.
This just in, breaking news
out of Long Beach:
a man nearly beaten to death. Let's go
now to our field reporter at the scene.
The victim, Craig Tucker,
is listed in critical condition.
Those injuries are described
as being very severe,
and it is not immediately clear
whether or not he will recover.
A police spokesman says
the search for suspects is ongoing.
But they have no further comment.
Back to you.
In other news,
citizens are outraged...
- Wait for me.
- Come on, slowpoke.
No no, I'm heading
to the hospital before my shift.
Shh shh shh shh.
- Uh...
- Shut it off.
Yeah.
Look, I'll see you there.
No questions,
just listen to me.
I need you to do exactly
what I tell you to do, okay?
- Okay. Yeah.
- I need you to let everybody know
that they gotta be very careful
right now. Nobody stays at their place.
Call the police and say that threats
have been made against the firehouse.
Get a police detail, not only
on the station, but on all your runs.
You kidding me?
You know it's not that easy.
Just do it! Okay?
Just fucking do it!
And don't tell anybody
that you've seen me.
Nobody-- not the guys,
not Maria, nobody.
I can't see fucking Craig and he's
sitting in the fucking hospital!
Is he gonna be okay?
Have they heard?
I don't know, man.
It's not looking good.
Jeremy, talk to me, dude.
What are you doing?
Just no questions, please!
So how's Maria?
Is she good?
You met somebody.
Yeah.
I just hope to God you guys get
a chance to meet her someday.
I need you to do me a favor.
All my fire gear is
over at the fire house.
Before your shift, I need you
to go drop my duffel bag off
over in the park
behind those benches, okay?
And one more thing.
If you don't hear from me
in the next few days,
I need you to take this.
There's a letter next to the bed.
Take it to the US Marshals' Service,
all right?
- They'll know how to get it to her.
- Who is she?
Just..
Just do it for me.
Yeah. All right.
Okay.
- Hello.
- Hey, what's up, Paul?
So I ran that print.
It came back with a hit.
It's in the system, this person,
the only problem is
it's coming back with no ID.
- No name, no nothing?
- No.
I figure it must
have been in there,
but for some reason
it got taken out?
You ever heard of that?
No.
Thank you.
- This is dispatch.
- Mike Cella.
- Lieutenant?
- I need to put out an APB on a suspect.
Go ahead with your description.
Lieutenant?
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Sir?
No no, I don't have
the right information yet.
This is Talia Durham.
Badge 4382.
I need an override
on a blocked number
incoming to my old cell
last night around 12:00.
Area code 562? That's--
that's Long Beach, California, right?
It's a cell. Great.
Thank-- thank you.
Hi, yes.
I need a cab to the airport.
No, right now.
Thank you.
That V8 is rumbling
I feel right at home
When I push the hammer down
I hear the engine moan
I'm up in seventh heaven
And I don't wanna come down
'Cause I'm alive when
I hear that Mustang sound
Yeah, I'm alive when I hear
that Mustang sound
This is a lifetime affair...
Welcome to the party, motherfucker!
God damn.
Jeremy Coleman!
Hagan's gonna love me.
I'm bringing you back alive!
Hell, he just might make me
employee of the motherfucking week!
What?
You want that?
Do you want this gun, huh?
Is this what you want?
You ain't gettin' it, motherfucker.
You in my house now,
you hear me?
You don't bring no gun
to my fuckin' party.
Who do you think you are,
comin' in here?
Act like you own
this fuckin' place.
I'm gonna stick this gun
right up your ass.
God damn it!
Ah ahhh ahhh.
My fuckin' leg!
Get up and crawl,
you son of a bitch.
Right here.
Sit right there.
You caught me at a bad time.
I'm about to kill some Crips.
I put a trace
on the marshal's credit cards.
Nothing since New Orleans.
Today she bought
a last-minute plane ticket.
I'm already here in Long Beach.
There's only one reason
she'd leave protection and come here.
He's here.
God damn it.
I need you to tell me
how to get to Hagan.
Where does he go?
- When is he alone?
- Blood in, blood out.
What is that
supposed to mean?
To get in with Hagan,
you gotta kill somebody--
blood in.
Once you're in,
the only way out's
if you're dead-- blood out.
So fuck you!
Mr. Hagan, your men were
killed by Jeremy Coleman.
Well, it looks
like I misjudged him.
It's a good thing.
He's coming right to us.
- I didn't wanna have to do this.
- Heh, didn't--
You have any idea
who you're fucking with, huh?
I read your rap sheet--
all the things you've done,
all the people
you've done them to.
It's gonna make this part
a little bit easier.
Let me the fuck up outta here!
I guess you didn't do your job.
I guess I will.
I'm gonna hunt him down.
How will you hunt him down?
Stake out his house?
He doesn't live anywhere.
Storm his office?
He doesn't work anywhere.
You have no point of access.
I'm gonna take your fingers off.
You ain't got the balls.
Love will make you do
some fucked up things.
Fuck!
Look, I just wanna
know one thing.
Are you gonna earn your money?
Jeremy is a ghost, but so am I.
- Just tell me!
- Fuck you!
She's gonna die slow!
God, no!
God damn it!
I'll fucking tell you!
I'll find him.
Until then...
I'd watch your back.
- Fucking talk!
- Gathers.
Gethers keeps the list.
You get to Gethers and that's how
you get to fuckin' Hagan.
Now out me the fuck lose, man!
I told you what you wanted to know.
- Blood out, motherfucker.
- No.
Mike Cella.
This is Talia Durham.
I just got your email.
Can you talk?
You bet. I'm just trying
to figure out a gang war.
It doesn't look like
either side started it.
Do you have any evidence
that's leading you in another direction?
Marshal,
we should be careful what
we talk about on the phone.
- Have you told anyone?
- No.
Jeremy told me what happened
to your partner. I'm sorry.
Listen,
I want him dead and buried
as much as you do,
but I'm still a cop.
You understand that?
I came to stop
what's happening.
- You can stop it, Marshal?
- As soon as I can find him, yeah.
You have until 6:00.
After that he goes out
on NCIC. as a suspect.
Thanks, Lieutenant.
Detective Cella.
I just got off with CSU.
They found more blood
in the alley from the other night,
might be from one
of our perps, but--
But you didn't get
a match from CODIS.
Yeah, that's right.
Keep trying-
Call me if you get something.
Hey!
Mr. Coleman,
just stay right there, don't move.
I'm just guessing,
but I think the fire department
is probably not
on its way, yeah?
I turned off the call signal.
Ah, huh.
You know,
I don't know who's worse--
a man who kills a son
in front of his own father
or a man who gets paid to make sure
he gets to kill some more.
Just for the record,
I never wanted to become
the man that you think I am.
I happen to believe in this
adversarial system of justice of ours.
I happen to believe in it
with my whole heart.
The prosecutor
and defendant go at it,
the best advocate wins.
It's an excellent system.
It just leads to
a bizarre world sometimes,
where someone like me--
reputable and legitimate»
finds himself fighting on behalf
of the worst scum of the earth
like David Hagan.
Why do you represent him?
Why do I represent him?
I drop a man like David Hagan,
and he kills me,
then he kills my whole family
and then he kills my dog
just for the heck of it!
I didn't come here to harm you.
I never wanted to kill anybody.
Even Hagan.
But I cannot let him take
the lives of the people
that I love.
Do you understand that?
What are you gonna do? Huh?
How are you gonna get to him? He's got
a whole army around him at all times.
I got to you, didn't I?
Look, I've come this far,
I can finish this.
Just tell me where he's gonna be.
I know where he goes some nights.
Tonight.
Mmm, I bet you're wishing
you hadn't come alone.
That's not what I wish.
I'm gonna tell you
why I brought you here.
It's 'cause I'm confused.
You know, I'm wondering
why you didn't do anything
about those friends I lost.
That's one of the seven deadly sins:
sloth,
failure to utilize
your talents and gifts.
The news says
it's looking like homicide.
Yeah, it was homicide.
I just haven't gotten around to it.
I've been a little busy with the trial.
Oh.
Have you heard from your witness?
Yeah.
Looks like he's been a little busy too.
I'll tell you what:
we oughta skip the trial.
You'll save some time,
kill me.
Come on.
I won't blame you.
Every man's got his dark side.
Just shoot me.
Come on.
What's the matter?
Your gun broke?
No.
It works just fine.
Justice. You see,
there ain't enough of that
going around for the white man.
Yes.
Not enough of that going around
for murderers either.
I'm gonna kill that boy.
I'm gonna
bleed him out like a sow.
I lost a lot of good people.
And that hurts me.
It does. It really does.
And you know
what that's like 'cause,
as I recall, you--
you lost some good people, too,
some friends
I've been told.
Yeah.
Close friends.
You're not gonna kill anyone else.
Hey, cry baby.
Come on, get up.
Get up off your ass! Get up!
Get up off your ass, go!
As you can see, it has been
a bloody day in Long Beach.
A long simmering feud
between the Eastside Grips
and a rival white-power gang
has now exploded
into all-out warfare.
It began last night with the slaying
of three soldiers of Aryan crime boss
David Hagan,
and there have been multiple...
Adam, you've got
a Marshal Durham here to see you.
So really a horrific
bloody crime scene out here.
Now back to you in the studio.
Has anyone approached you
recently about Jeremy Coleman?
Look, it'd be weird if I had
heard from him, right?
It happens.
Witnesses get distraught,
they make mistakes.
I keep them safe from everyone,
including themselves.
You know Jeremy lost
his folks when he was young?
That was one of the things
he loved about this job.
You know, it feels like a family.
But I worry about him
because even though this
feels like a family, it's not really.
Now you gotta have more
in your life.
Look, if he--
if he did find someone
that he really cared about...
I think he would
do anything for her.
Things that might even
be hard to accept.
Where is he, Adam?
Look, if I do hear from him,
do you have a card or something?
Yeah, I do and normally
I would give you one
and tell you to call our field office,
but I'm not here officially.
I'm trying to keep this off the books.
And I have until the end of the day
and then no one can help him.
There.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks so much for waiting.
Do you know where
the Loam Motel is?
You bet.
Talia.
You wrote this in case you died.
And when I read it,
I thought you already had.
So now I know exactly
how it feels!
- Look, I had to do this.
- Now you have to stop.
Hagan will never stop,
do you hear me?
He's never gonna stop. He's gonna
keep coming for you and for me
and your family.
My best friend in the world
is in the hospital right now.
Hey, look at me.
I love you.
And this is what it's gonna take for us
to be together, do you hear me?
Yes.
I've had to do some awful things
the last couple of days,
but you're worth it.
Do you understand me?
The police know that it's you!
Lieutenant Cella, he figured it out.
And if I don't get you out
of Long Beach by 6:00 p.m.,
he's gonna put your face
on the wire.
Look, I let you in.
I can't go back to no one.
We can have a life together, but--
- I can finish this.
- No.
- Just let me finish this.
- This isn't you.
Please, tell me this isn't you.
Leave with me.
Please.
What what what what?
Oh my God,
what did you do?
Stay here, okay? Just stay
right here, I'll be right back.
No no no no! Jeremy!
Jeremy!
Think!
Cella.
It's quitting time.
You should go home.
You really think so, Jeremy?
You think it's quitting time?
Look, just one more night.
All right?
Let it play out.
Kid, you left a fingerprint.
Lieutenant, if I don't finish this,
she'll never be safe.
They found a fingerprint.
Do you understand
what that means?
That means they're gonna find
more forensic evidence.
They're gonna put you away.
You can't do this by yourself.
Yes, I can.
I have no choice.
What the hell am I supposed to do?
Just let it happen?
You've reached the voice-mail
for Lieutenant Michael Cella,
Gang and Narcotics Division.
Please leave a message
after the tone.
Hey, I'm coming to you.
I'll be at your office as soon
as I can find a cab--
You do what you have to do,
but tonight David Hagan
is going in the ground.
Wait! Wait!
I'm over here.
Where is he, huh?
Where is he?
Yeah?
David Hagan, current location
Hey, do me a favor
and leave your phone on.
- I wanna hear this.
- Jeremy?
Jeremy!
Listen, boy, you should not want
what you cannot have.
Oh shit!
Oh shit!
Jeremy!
I'm in here!
I'm in here! Damn it!
Talia!
Talia!
No!
Jeremy!
Talia!
We gotta get out of here.
Okay, come on!
Stay with me.
Okay, come on.
Come on, stay low! Stay low!
Okay, come on. Let's go.
Stay with me.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
Let's keep moving.
Jeremy!
Jeremy!
Come here, boy!
I'm over here!
Almost, boy.
Almost.
You were almost
strong enough to pull it off.
But your girlfriend Talia,
she's gonna die.
Die, boy!
You know what I think?
I think you just didn't
love her enough.
No.
Son of a bitch!
Die, boy!
He's gone. Come on.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Yeah.
I need you to trust me.
Do everything that I ask
and I promise we'll survive this.
Do you trust me?
Yeah.
Did they find anything
at all in that building?
The entire building was torched.
Nothing useful.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
