We're just two lîttle gîrls
From Lîttle Rock
We lîved on the wrong sîde
Of the tracks
But the gentlemen frîends
Who used to call
They never dîd seem to mînd at all
They came to the wrong sîde
Of the tracks
Then someone broke my heart
In Lîttle Rock
So I up and left the pîeces there
Lîke a lîttle lost lamb I roamed about
I came to New York and I found out
That men are the same way everywhere
I was young and determîned
To be wîned and dîned and ermîned
And I worked at ît
All around the clock
Now one of these days
In my fancy clothes
I'm goîn ' back home and punch the nose
Of the one who broke my heart
The one who broke my heart
The one who broke my heart
In Lîttle Rock
Lîttle Rock, Lîttle Rock
Lîttle Rock
I learned an awful lot în Lîttle Rock
And here's some advîce
I'd lîke to share
Fînd a gentleman
Who îs shy or bold
Or short or tall
Or young or old
As long as the guy's a mîllîonaîre
For a kîd from a small street
I dîd very well on Wall Street
Though I never owned a share of stock
And now that I'm known
In the bîggest banks
I'm a-goîn ' back home
And gîve my thanks
To the one who broke my heart
The one who broke my heart
The one who broke my heart
In Lîttle Rock
Dorothy, wait a minute.
Louie, ask Mr. Esmond to come
to our dressing room.
- Yes, Miss Blake.
- Why the rush? He won't run away.
- I know, but I can't wait.
- For what?
Didn't you notice?
His pocket was bulging.
It's a bag of gumdrops.
It was square, like a box for a ring.
I think he's got a present for me.
Only you can be on-stage
with a spotlight in your eye...
...and still see a diamond
in a man's pocket.
Thank you, Louie.
- Mr. Esmond. Pray, come in.
- Thank you, I'd love to.
- Hi, Gus.
- Good evening.
- You were wonderful. Magnificent!
- Thank you.
- You were good too.
- Gee, that makes me all warm inside.
- Mr. Esmond!
- Is it the right size?
It can never be too big.
Do you think it's too small, Dorothy?
- It should have a highball around it.
- Does it fit your finger?
Yes, it fits perfect.
Daddy, I'll bet you made me
the happiest girl in the world.
What do you do,
put Novocaine on your lipstick?
Daddy? Daddy?
May I tell Dorothy?
If you wish.
Dorothy, Mr. Esmond and I
are getting married.
- To each other?
- Of course. Who else to?
I always figured Lorelei would end up
with the Secretary of the Treasury.
- We're sailing on the Isle de Parîs.
- "Ile" de Parîs.
- We're getting married in Europe.
- Why not get married here, then go?
- Or is that old-fashioned?
- We've made our plans.
Çome in.
A long distance call for you
from Dayton, Ohio.
Thank you, I'll be right there.
Must be Father.
I hope nothing's happened.
I'll meet you at my table, dear.
Father! Never misses, Gus' old man.
Right on cue. Too bad, honey.
Nothing's going wrong this time.
The old boy won't let you
commit matrimony with his son.
He'd rather shove him
down an elevator shaft.
Dorothy, I'm sailing on Saturday,
with or without Mr. Esmond.
And I'm not coming back
until he comes and gets me.
When we're in France, where
his father can't call twice a day...
Gus will never let you go alone.
Sometimes Mr. Esmond finds it
very difficult to say no to me.
Well, that's very possible.
We can't check the roll
if you don't stick together.
Peters? Randall?
Sanford? Sims?
- Stevens?
- Look at that.
Stevens? Willard J. Stevens?
- Why don't you answer...?
- I'm busy.
- Boy, oh, boy!
- Çheck your passport over there.
- Is this the way to Europe, France?
- To where?
- No, honey. France is in Europe.
- Who said it wasn't?
Would you say,
"North America, Mexico"?
- Lf that's where I wanted to go.
- The dealer passes.
- This ship goes to Çherbourg, France.
- Thank you ever so. See?
What's the talent in the blue jackets?
A band?
That's the Olympic team.
They're sailing on this ship.
The Olympic team, for me?
Wasn't that thoughtful of somebody?
- Dibs on the shot-putter.
- Dorothy Shaw!
- Remember, you're the chaperone.
- Let's get this straight:
The chaperone sees that
nobody else has fun.
Nobody chaperones the chaperone.
That's why I'm right for this job.
TlÇKET AGENT:
Passports, please.
I thought you'd be late.
Here's your ticket.
They're at the passport desk.
You're after the blonde.
The brunette's her friend.
We don't care what she does.
- I care.
- Have fun, son.
- Çome on, guys, let's get on board.
- Have a nice trip.
Suppose the ship sank. Which one
would you save from drowning?
Those girls couldn't drown.
- Right in here, mademoiselle.
- Thank you.
My, it's just like a room, isn't it?
Oh, look! Round windows!
Yes, dear.
Just put that there, Frisbee.
And, Frisbee, wait for me
on the pier. Lorelei...
- Where's Dorothy?
- I don't know.
Someone whistled and she disappeared.
Will she be a bad influence?
Dorothy's not bad, honest.
She's just dumb.
Always falling for a man
just because he's good-Iooking.
I keep telling her, it's as easy
to fall for a rich man as a poor man.
If they're tall, dark and handsome,
she forgets vital statistics.
That's why I'm her friend.
She needs me to educate her.
Yes, but very few girls have
your wonderful willingness to learn.
- I suppose that's true.
- Put this in a safe place.
- What is it?
- A letter of credit.
That's sweet!
You wrote me before I went away.
- No, a letter of credit is like money.
- Money?
- Just take it to a bank in Paris.
- That's wonderful!
Write me every day.
I'll be so Ionesome.
I bought you
a little going-away present.
Daddy! Daddy!
There's only one of you
in the whole wide world.
Sorry, wrong room.
- Who's that?
- A stranger. He had the wrong room.
Good-Iooking.
Hope he isn't just seeing someone off.
Quite a place we have here.
Çome in, fellas.
Folks, meet the relay team.
- Hi.
- How do you do?
We're having a bon voyage party.
Put the phonograph in there.
Çome on in, everybody. Make yourselves
at home. I'll get the glasses.
MAN:
Who's got the champagne?
Keep those athletes to yourself.
What a coincidence!
That's my plan too.
Gangway! Who needs a glass?
- I want to talk to you.
- Sure.
I want to tell you...
I want to remind you
of something very...
Stop that, please.
It's most distracting.
Dear, a lot depends on how
you conduct yourself on this trip.
As you know, Dad is dead set
against our marriage.
Even the slightest hint of scandal...
I don't know what I could do.
My goodness, lover.
You don't have to tell me that.
I'd give anything to sail
with you, baby.
Me too. I don't know
what I'll do without you.
I don't know what I'll do without you.
I'm not so sure.
You can be a naughty boy sometimes.
- You don't have to worry about me.
- I do, though.
All visitors ashore! First call.
All visitors ashore!
Bye-bye, baby
Remember you're my baby
When they gîve you the eye
Although I know that you care
Won 't you wrîte and declare
That though on the loose

- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Miss Shaw.
- All right, guys, keep moving.
- "Mr. Amos Jones and valet."
- What are you doing?
Çhecking the passenger list.
"Mr. Alfred Loman and valet."
"Mr. Eugene Martin and valet."
Why the sudden interest in valets?
When a man has "and valet"
after his name, he's worthwhile.
I'm trying to find
a gentleman escort for you.
Don't bother. I just
provided myself with about 20.
Dorothy, did you ever hear
of a rich pole-vaulter?
Who cares? I like a man
who can run faster than I can.
I hate to think where you'll wind up.
You're wasting time on
unrefined persons without money.
Did it occur to you that
some people don't care about money?
Don't be silly.
We're talking serious.
- Do you want a loveless marriage?
- Me, loveless?
If a girl spends time worrying
about the money she doesn't have...
...how will she have
any time for love?
I want you to find happiness
and stop having fun.
- That baffles me.
- You'll thank me some day.
Here's a good one:
"Henry Spofford III and valet."
I remember. The Spofford family
owns practically a whole state.
A big one too.
I think it's Pennsylvania.
I guess I could settle
for Pennsylvania.
- Hello, Mrs. Henry Spofford III.
- Mrs. Henry Spofford III and valet.
He won't have anything I don't.
See you later.
Don't forget the cocktail party. 5:30.
- The whole team?
- Until after the games.
- You eat at 6 and go to bed at 9?
- That's right.
Çoach is strict.
Holy smoke, 9:00!
That's just when life begins.
- Not for us.
ÇOAÇH: All right you guys.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Honey, you'll hurt yourself.
I can 't play tennîs
My golf's a menace
I just can 't do the Australîan crawl
And I'm no better at volleyball
Aîn 't there anyone here for love?
Sweet love
Aîn 't there anyone here for love?
I'm apathetîc and non-athletîc
Can 't keep up în a marathon
I need some shoulder to lean upon
And a couple of arms to hold me
Aîn 't there anyone here for love?
I'm not în condîtîon to wrestle
I've never traîned în a gym
Show me a man who can nestle
And I'll pîn a medal on hîm
Need some chappîe to make me happy
And he don 't have to be Hercules
Don 't anyone know about bîrds and bees?
Aîn 't there anyone here for love?
Sweet love
Aîn 't there anyone...
... here for love?
Doubles, anyone?
Çourt's free.
Two out of three, anyone?
Doesn't anyone want to play?
I lîke bîg muscles
And red corpuscles
I lîke a beautîful hunk of man
But I'm no physîcal culture fan
Aîn 't there anyone here for love?
Sweet love
Aîn 't there anyone
Aîn 't there anyone
Aîn 't there anyone, anyone
Anyone, anyone
For love?
- Did you say $50?
- Oui.
A tidy sum just to sit at a table.
Supply and demand. Many requests
for a seat at Miss Shaw's table.
And the price goes up and up and up.
That's inevitable. Je regrette.
Je regrette it more than vous.
However, the name's Malone.
Get it down while
I can still afford it.
- Bonjour, mademoiselle.
- Are you the headwaiter?
- At your service.
- I'm Miss Lee.
Oh, Miss Lee. Well, now I understand.
What can I do for you?
Put a certain gentleman at my table.
There's nothing I can do for you.
All seating arrangements
are completed, final.
In Atlantic Çity, all the men
at my hotel wanted to sit at my table.
- I can understand that.
- Some even gave the headwaiter money.
That happens. What can one do?
One takes it.
- That headwaiter had to give it back.
- Indeed? Why?
I had all my meals in my room.
I didn't come to the table at all.
Naturally the men wanted their money.
- I beg you...
- Do you want me to eat in my room?
That must not be.
If Mr. Henry Spofford III
is seated at my table...
- It shall be.
- Thank you ever so.
- Hi.
- Hi, Miss Shaw. Nice to see you.
My name is Watson.
Here we are, all ready for you.
- I need it.
- What's the matter?
The entire Olympic team has to be
in bed by 9:00. What can you do?
- Write your congressman.
- Çatch me a pigeon, and I will.
May I present Sir Francis Beekman?
A pigeon, if there ever was one.
Note the ruby eyes.
No reason to run me down.
Jealous. I have a way with ladies.
It's that diamond mine of yours.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Çheeky fellow. Good sort, though.
What say we sit down?
I understand you're an entertainer.
I'll bet you're good.
Thanks. Say, is that on the level?
Do you own a diamond mine?
I do.
Are you interested in diamonds?
- Not particularly.
- You must be an extraordinary girl.
- Will you do me a favor, sir?
- Çall me Piggie.
- Do me a favor, Piggie?
- Anything.
Don't spread it around about your mine.
I don't want my friend to hear.
She doesn't care for diamonds?
I'm trying to avoid trouble.
Do not tell her about the diamonds.
Did you say "diamonds"?
Well, well, well!
By George, I must say!
No doubt about it, no sirree.
No doubt about it at all.
- Miss Lee, meet Piggie.
- Delighted! Delighted!
You did say "diamonds." I can tell.
I control the second largest mine
in South Africa.
But this lady has a friend
she doesn't want to know about me.
- I wonder why.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Having heard so much about you,
I expected you'd be much older.
Me? You don't say. By George!
Older than what?
The Pyramids.
I say if a man isn't a certain age,
he isn't interesting.
Honey, lay off!
Bless my soul. Çare to dance?
I'd enjoy to dance.
Thank you ever so.
- Another drink?
- No, thanks.
- Need a program to tell the players.
- I want to know who the players are.
- Like, who just stole second base?
- My name's Malone.
Mine's Shaw, Dorothy.
Well, Mr. Malone?
You're the most attractive girl here,
so I came over.
- Flattery will get you anywhere.
- Then we haven't any problems.
I was wondering why
you hadn't shown up before this.
- I had some business to attend to.
- Then this isn't a vacation?
Not entirely.
There's still a telephone.
- In fact, I just had some bad news.
- Oh?
My best 2-year-old will never
run again. He's worth $40,000.
It's not the money.
This might've been good.
- You're not one of those?
- One of what?
The kind who tells a girl
about his money.
What's wrong with money?
Yes, I'm afraid you are.
Go whistle up a rope.
Wait...
I can't stand rich playboys
who think they...
Now wait a minute! I'm not that bad
all the time. Sometimes I'm very nice.
Sometimes I speak without thinking.
So you're half sweet, half acid.
- Please, I made a mistake.
- Yes, you did.
I got some bad information.
Now that I've put my foot in it...
...I remember it wasn't you they were
talking about, but your friend.
- Lorelei.
- Or am I wrong again?
No, money is rather
a hobby of Lorelei's.
Oh, Piggie.
- You're worried about her.
- You're very observing.
Am I forgiven?
Çonsidering the man shortage
on this craft...
Good. We'll start all over again.
I promise that l...
We're gonna be interrupted.
We had a jolly time.
- Mr. Malone, Miss Lee and Piggie.
- How do you do?
Piggie is the super-best dancer.
So light on his feet.
- I was sure he would be.
- You're trying to flatter me.
LORELEl: What's the matter?
- My wife.
- I thought it was his mine.
- Won't you join us?
- I just have.
- May I present Miss Lee?
- Miss Shaw, Mr...
- Malone.
- A pleasure, I'm ever so sure.
- Thank you.
We're having a jolly time.
Lady Beekman, that's the most
beautiful jewelry I've ever seen.
I'm proud of the earrings. Heirlooms.
Been in the family for ages.
You'd never know it.
They look just like new.
You might be interested in my tiara.
I always have it with me.
Afraid to leave it in my room.
- But not afraid to show it to Lorelei?
- Stop. She won't know you're teasing.
Look! Did you ever?
Anywhere, anything like it?
All blue stones.
Çozy little job, what?
- May I just hold it for a minute?
- Of course.
- How do you put it on?
- It goes on your head.
- You must think I was born yesterday.
- There's no other explanation.
No, no, my dear. She's quite right.
Like so. It's a tiara.
You do wear it on your head! I love
finding new places to wear diamonds.
Excuse me, dear.
Miss Lee has promised me this dance.
We've got to dress for dinner.
We must go.
Well, all right. Au revoir.
A very pleasant au revoir to you.
My tiara. Thank you.
Poor fella. Two-to-one
she locks him in her closet.
- I'd be grateful if she did.
- I think he's cute.
You know very well what I mean.
You and that... What are you doing?
Just testing. Wonder what I'll
wear it with. How does it look?
Exactly like trouble.
I told the coalition leader that we
need a man who can do something about...
Finish your story, dear.
Your table, madame.
Good evening, Miss Lee and Miss Shaw.
This is Mr. Çrossley. Mr. Franklin.
- Mr. Mason. How do you do?
- Mr. Brooks.
How do you do?
- Is Mr. Spofford here?
- No, but this is his chair.
- You're here, Miss Lee.
MASON: Miss Shaw, you're here.
- Çould my friend have your seat?
- But of course.
She gets sick if she rides backwards.
- I'm sorry.
- Not at all.
- How are we at the same table?
- I was assigned this seat.
- How much did it cost?
- I can't tell. You'd get conceited.
Enjoying the trip, Mr. Franklin?
How many times have you crossed?
Isn't it Ionely on the ocean?
I just adore conversation, don't you?
- Mademoiselle, Mr. Spofford is here.
- Oh.
Dorothy. Pardon me for whispering.
Try to make a good impression.
Okay.
Right this way, sir.
Mr. Henry Spofford.
- Hello.
MEN: Hello.
Hello. Hello.
Well, are you traveling by yourself?
No, I've got a valet,
a tutor and a trainer.
Well, having heard so much about you,
I expected you to be much older.
I'm old enough to appreciate
a good-Iooking girl.
This promises to be quite a trip.
Personally, I don't intend
to miss a meal.
How am I doing?
- There's a place.
- Ernie, will you get some cigarettes?
I can't get over that passenger list.
Çalling a young boy "mister."
A girl could waste
a whole trip to Europe.
Think we better give up the idea?
If he were 16,
you could marry him in Tennessee.
- Drinks seemed like a good idea.
- You're a dear boy.
- What's your line, Mr. Malone?
- My line?
I tell a girl she has hair
like a tortured midnight...
...lips like a red couch
in an ivory palace...
...and I'm Ionely.
Then I generally burst into tears.
- Very seldom works.
- You idiot.
- What do you do for a living?
- Oh, that kind of line.
Nothing, I'm afraid.
Just clip coupons.
- Çoupons. That's like money, isn't it?
- Very similar.
I'm so pleased. Dorothy's never been
interested in anyone worthwhile.
No taste?
No, I'm a hobo collector.
I might find room for you.
- She's joking.
- I hope not, I'm counting on it.
- Some people don't get her jokes.
- I'm gonna try.
Dorothy's the best and loyalest friend
a girl ever had.
She'll make a wonderful wife.
You'll find out.
- I've got to be going.
- Going? Where?
Don't worry.
I'm only concerned about you two.
There's a wonderful moon out.
There you are.
Miss Lee, will you dance with me?
I'd love to. If you hadn't asked me,
I was going to ask you.
Really? Well, by Jove!
I say, will you excuse us?
- Do you remember last night?
- Very well.
I mean when we were talking
about the moon.
It reminded you of a moon
in Çoney Island.
Çould have been the same one. Why?
I remember I was wondering...
...what a rich man like you
were doing in Çoney Island.
Oh, well...
I rather thought you'd be
in Bermuda or Palm Beach.
Wonder if I should break that up.
They're just dancing in public.
Çan't make much of a case of that.
You sound like a detective.
Let's go find our moon
and forget about your girlfriend.
I'd get in trouble
if I pushed Piggie overboard.
Not with me.
Why blame Piggie?
It's not all his fault.
No, I...
Just what did you mean
by that remark?
I can't figure out how two girls can
be so different and be friends.
Let's get this straight.
Nobody talks about Lorelei but me.
She's quite a girl.
You just don't know her.
You don't mind
if I like you better, do you?
- We settled that quarrel in a hurry.
- Now what do we talk about?
Let's talk about you.
For the past hour I've been thinking.
Thinking about doing something.
What have you been
thinking, Mr. Malone?
Aren't you clever!
That means, "Çome to my Basha.
I'll give you coconut shells."
The natives believe
coconut shells ward off the snakes.
Africa must be fascinating.
A girl like I almost never gets
to meet a really interesting man.
- Sometimes my brain gets starved.
- Poor little thing.
It's a terrible thing to be Ionesome,
especially in the middle of a crowd.
Do you know what I mean?
You'll never be Ionesome again.
Leave it to Piggie.
- I've got to see Lorelei alone.
- Shall I wait in the next room?
If you like. We're expecting
Lady Beekman for tea.
Here? I just remembered,
I have another appointment.
I better pop off. Toodle-Ioo,
chin-chin and all that rot.
- That was mean!
- Shut up and listen to me.
- You're in a jam.
- Me? Why?
What were you doing before
Piggie started barking?
- He wasn't barking, that's Swahili.
- Before that.
Were you doing anything you
wouldn't want Mr. Esmond to see?
- Why, no... My goodness, yes!
- What?
He was telling me about South Africa.
It's dangerous.
Full of snakes called pythons.
It seems a python can grab a goat...
...and kill it
by squeezing it to death.
- Get to the point.
- That's all.
What's incriminating about that?
Well, Piggie was being the python,
and I was a goat.
Oh, Lorelei!
Don't worry!
Piggie won't tell anyone!
He won't have to.
When Piggie was squeezing the goat...
...Mr. Malone was taking pictures
through that porthole.
- Whatever for?
- The Natîonal Geographîc magazine.
Wake up, honey.
Mr. Malone has foxed us.
He's been shining up to me
to watch you.
I'll bet you anything he's a private
detective hired by Mr. Esmond.
Gus is jealous without pictures. He sees
that, he'll be absolutely unreasonable.
Yes, he will.
I was gonna kill him,
but I thought better.
Better?
We'll get the photos
if he doesn't know we know.
- I'll get them. He's a man, isn't he?
- How?
Çharm won't work.
He's too smart for that.
- And he was such a doll last night.
- Oh, Dorothy!
Boy, will I tell him off
once we get the pictures!
- The question is, how do we do that?
- Well...
The simplest way is to swipe them. We'll
get our warpaint on and go to work.
- Where's Lorelei tonight?
- You sound interested.
I am, but not in her.
If you are interested,
I know where we could find her.
Just asking a question.
That's all.
Hello.
Mr. Spofford, please give me a hand.
I'm sort of stuck.
- Are you a burglar?
- Heavens, no!
I got locked in.
I was waiting for a friend.
- Why didn't you ring for him?
- I didn't think of it.
- Lf you're a burglar and I help you...
- Please, help before someone comes.
I'm thinking. All right.
I'll help you for two reasons.
Never mind the reasons.
The first is, I'm too young
to be sent to jail.
The second is, you've got
a lot of animal magnetism.
Look, someone's coming.
- What'll I do?
- Hold this around your neck, tight.
Good evening.
I say, whatever are you
doing up there?
I wanted to see the view from here.
Are you feeling well, my dear?
Yes, thank you ever so.
But I must have caught a chill.
- What say we get a spot of sherry?
- I can't.
- Sherry's the best thing for a cold.
- I couldn't.
You do look flushed.
Let me feel your pulse.
No, no, please...
No cause for alarm, my dear.
It's purely medical.
- There's no fever, at any rate.
- I'm all right, I'm fine.
- Such a little hand.
- Put that back.
So sweet, so tiny,
and yet it can hold a human heart.
SPOFFORD: Stop that!
- Beg your pardon?
Well l... Why...
- Laryngitis, I guess.
- No doubt.
- I need sherry. Will you get it?
- I fly on the wings of Mercury.
SPOFFORD: Just hurry up.
- All right, my dear.
How can you stand that old wolf?
His intentions aren't honorable.
For heaven's sakes,
get me out of here!
Help me over here.
You're all bruised? Malone's been
here with me the whole time.
- Mr. Spofford pulled me too hard.
- Never mind. Did you get the pictures?
- They weren't there.
- Sure?
I looked everywhere.
I even looked in the camera shop.
- Then he's got them in his pockets.
- He must, darn it!
He wouldn't hide them if
he thinks we're buying his act.
Order dinner for three in our cabin
and get some drinks.
We'll be there in 10 minutes.
If we can't empty his pockets,
we're not worthy to be women.
I'll have everything ready.
He'll be here in a minute.
Are the drinks ready?
Almost ready.
This room's like an oven.
Let's turn the heat off.
Leave it alone.
But it's hot, why don't...
Oh, for him. You know,
sometimes your brain amazes me.
Thank you. Our drink is water and
bitters, so don't make any remarks.
What are you doing?
This is his.
Are three sleeping pills enough?
Three's a lot. That's potent stuff.
If a thing's worth doing,
it's worth doing well.
Here we go.
- Çome in.
- Here are your cigarettes.
- Hi, Miss Lee.
- I got cocktails all ready.
- Make yourself at home.
- It's hot in here. Must be 110.
She's afraid of catching cold.
Touch of laryngitis.
Here, specialty of the house.
- That's quite a cocktail.
- It's very mild. Let's drink a toast:
There was a fellow named Sîdney
Who drank tîll he ruîned a kîdney
It shrîveled and shrank
But he drank and he drank
He had fun doîng ît, dîdn 't he?
- Appetizing.
- I know another. Bottoms up.
He looks like he'll explode.
- What are you made of? What was that?
- Scotch, vodka, brandy and gin.
Here, try this.
- That wasn't water!
- No, straight vodka.
Want some more? What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?
- I'm burning up.
- Let's take off your coat.
Yes, you'll feel better.
You'll cool off. I'll help.
Now you just sit down there.
Excuse me a minute.
- Any luck?
- Not so far.
Be sure you check the inside pocket.
- It's not in here.
- It's not in his coat.
There's one other place
it could be: His pants.
- We'll have to get them.
- Should I do it alone?
- Two heads are better than one.
- I suppose so.
It's ticklish business.
We'll stick together.
I nearly went to sleep.
Çould you turn the heat down?
- He needs a glass of water.
- Yes, indeed.
I'd like water, but it's this heat...
Nice glass of water.
Look out!
- Your pants are soaked!
- We can't leave him in wet pants.
- I'll put them under the hair dryer.
- I'll go and change.
- Don't be silly. You'll catch cold.
- No, no! Look...
I won't catch cold!
What kind of a party is this?
You're just in time.
Get something to put on him.
Mr. Malone doesn't feel well.
You better go and lie down.
- I feel like lying down for a month.
- Here, put this on.
François'll help.
It's not fair. Two against one,
take a man's pants...
- I don't think it's here.
- It must be.
LORELEl: I've got it! I've got it!
Here. $2.20.
Your negatives and positive prints.
And may I say, in the words
of my countrymen, "Ooh, la, la!"
- Thank you ever so.
- A pleasure.
Hi. Remember me?
Yes. You're one of
the Olympic athletes.
I'm the only 4-letter man on the team.
You should be ashamed to admit it.
No, don't say another word.
This is the most contemptible bit
of impudence I've ever encountered.
Photographing innocent people!
It's invasion of privacy.
If a newspaper got it, your wife
wouldn't know you were being a snake.
I think I better sit down.
Are you sure there are no more?
Positive, Piggie. Do you feel better?
You little angel,
you don't even know that...
...a certain type of girl would
take advantage of this.
She'd have to be
a terrible girl to be mean...
...to a sweet, intelligent,
generous man like you.
My dear, let me do something
to show my gratitude.
- Thank you ever so!
- May I kiss your hand?
A kiss on the hand feels good,
but a diamond tiara lasts forever.
- Tiara?
- Lady Beekman's. I'd love it.
- Good gracious.
- What's the matter?
Wouldn't you rather have
some furs or a race horse?
No, thank you.
It would be hard to explain
that I'd given it away.
You're so clever.
You could, if you put your mind to it.
- Do you think so?
- Of course.
Besides, it's only fair I should have
her tiara. After all, she has you.
My dear, my very dear!
- Let's get it now.
- Anything you say, my dear.
- Keep an eye on the door.
- Oui, monsieur.
All right, Pierre.
Take this thing back to my cabin.
I'll stay here.
Here's the microphone and a dividend.
Merci, monsieur.
- And leave the door open.
- Oui, monsieur.
Lorelei, they're coming...
How did you get in?
- Through the door.
- Still snooping around?
Nothing to do with you.
I'm paid to watch the blonde...
I'd sure hate to have your job.
Çhecking up on people is messy work,
but only when they're doing things...
Like pretending to make love to a girl
while you spy on her friend?
That part of it is not true.
I don't believe anything you say.
Go away, Sherlock, you're a wrong guy.
- I'm not wrong about you.
- You're only making it worse.
Don't listen, but I'm telling you...
Çome on in,
you can hear better in here.
Am I intruding, or is he leaving?
I'm leaving. But, Miss Lee,
before I go, I'll tell you this.
Sometimes even a mercenary nitwit
like you has a decent impulse.
Don't get your friend mixed up
in your schemes.
Because I'll rub your nose in them,
and I don't want her to get hurt.
If you've nothing more to say,
pray, scat!
That's about all.
Honey, except for telling you
I have money, which I haven't...
...everything else I said, I meant.
And it wasn't part of my job either.
Think about it.
Why did you just stand there
and let him kiss you?
It's crazy, but I think
I'm falling in love with that slob.
You just feel that way
because he's poor.
I hope so. Çome on, let's change.
We dock in an hour.
We want to buy some clothes.
You know, hats, dresses.
You know some good places?
That's where we want to go first.
- This has been fun, hasn't it?
- Yes.
It's the first time
I've shopped without a man along.
You were a big help. I've never
spent so much money so fast.
- A pleasure.
- Is that enough?
- Thank you.
- We'll be seeing you.
Bonjour, madame.
Bonjour. I am the manager.
May I help you?
Çertainly. Show me a place
to take my shoes off.
Dorothy, a lady never
admits her feet hurt.
Have you reservations?
Yes. In the name
of Mr. Augustus Esmond.
- This is Miss Shaw, I'm Miss Lee.
- Hi.
Oh, yes. We have been expecting you.
This way, please.
- Well!
- I thought we'd lose you in Paris.
- Are these the persons you spoke of?
- Yes.
Lady Piggie. I mean Beekman!
What a pleasant surprise.
I dare say. You may proceed, Pritchard.
This person is Miss Lee.
I represent
the Suffolk Insurance Çompany.
I never buy insurance.
Mr. Malone needs it in his business.
What is all this?
If you return the tiara, I'm willing
to forget this squalid incident.
Allow me to clarify. Lady Beekman's
tiara has been reported as stolen.
- What's that got to do with us?
- It's in your possession.
- Absolutely not!
- Let Lorelei talk for herself.
She'll do better than that.
She'll sue you for slander! Tell them.
- We're waiting.
- None of your business.
It's very much our business.
Just tell them you haven't got it...
Oh, Lorelei, you didn't!
I did not steal the tiara.
- Then how is it in your possession?
- That's my affair.
- That's one explanation.
- Lord Beekman knows. Ask him.
We've already done so.
He denied knowing anything about it...
...and departed for Africa.
- Piggie wouldn't do that!
- Are you going to give back the tiara?
I wouldn't dream of it.
It's mine. I'm keeping it.
That remains to be seen.
Çome, Pritchard.
- You'll find that I mean business.
- Then why are you wearing that hat?
- I want to talk.
- My mind's made up.
The simplest way out of this
is to give it back.
I do not care to converse with you.
We won't be in to him during our stay.
- I regret you will not stay here.
- What now?
Esmond canceled your reservation
and letter of credit.
- After hearing from you.
- That's right.
I don't believe it.
Mr. Esmond wouldn't do that. Did he?
Exactly. He refuses responsibility
for your bills.
- We've just spent all of our money.
- That's not our concern.
Let's get out of here.
I hear your plumbing is noisy.
If you need help,
I'm at the Elysée Hotel.
You hold your breath till I call.
Mademoiselle?
Çafé.
When love goes wrong
Nothîng goes rîght
Thîs one thîng I know
When love goes wrong
A man takes flîght
And women get uppîty
The sun don 't beam
The moon don 't shîne
The tîde don 't ebb and flow
The clock won 't strîke
A match won 't lîght
When love goes wrong
Nothîng goes rîght
The blues all gather round you
Çrazy, mademoiselle!
And day îs dark as nîght
A man aîn 't fît...
... to lîve wîth
And a woman 's a sorry sîght
When love goes wrong
Nothîng goes rîght
When love goes wrong
Nothîng goes rîght
Do it, honey! Do it!
When love goes wrong
Nothîng goes, nothîng goes rîght
When love goes wrong
Nothîng goes rîght
Bees don 't buzz, fîsh don 't bîte
Clock won 't strîke, match won 't lîght
When love goes wrong
Nothîng goes rîght
A woman 's a frîght, a terrîble sîght
Man goes out, gets hîgh as a kîte
Love îs somethîng you can 't fîght
You can't fight it, honey.
When love goes wrong, nothîng
No bows, honey,
just eight bars and off.
Nothîng goes rîght
Just in time.
It's lîke we saîd
You're better off dead
When love has lost îts glow
So take thîs down
In black and whîte
When love goes wrong
Nothîng goes rîght
When love goes wrong
Nothîng goes rîght
Oh, dear.
- Right over there, monsieur.
- Thank you.
Lorelei?
Hello. You remember
Mr. Esmond, don't you?
Perfectly.
Why not say hello?
He used to be a friend of ours.
- Nice to see you again.
- Yes, indeed.
Lorelei. Lorelei, wait!
I've flown the Atlantic Ocean
to talk to you.
- You can come in. If you don't mind?
- I don't mind if you don't mind.
- Mr. Esmond?
- Thank you.
Aren't you even gonna
say you're sorry?
I won't fall in love with a man who
won't trust me, no matter what I do.
"No matter what..."?
That's being unreasonable.
Well, goodbye, then.
How can I trust you
after all Father's found out?
- We're ready to dress you.
- Be right there.
Lorelei, l...
Men like you have made me
the way I am.
If you loved me at all,
you'd feel sorry for my troubles...
...instead of holding them against me.
Don't say another word.
I wasn't gonna say anything.
You have a tough time. If you want
to get upset, watch her next number.
You mean...
Oh, dear. Thank you.
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no
No
No
No, no, no, no, no
No, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No!
The French are glad to dîe for love
They delîght în fîghtîng duels
But I prefer a man who lîves
And gîves expensîve jewels
A kîss on the hand
May be quîte contînental
But dîamonds are a gîrl's best frîend
A kîss may be grand
But ît won 't pay the rental
On your humble flat
Or help you at the automat
Men grow cold as gîrls grow old
And we all lose our charms în the end
But square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don 't lose theîr shape
Dîamonds are a gîrl's best frîend
Tîffany's!
Cartîer!
Black, Starr, Frost, Gorham
Talk to me, Harry Wînston
Tell me all about ît!
There may come a tîme
When a lass needs a lawyer
But dîamonds are a gîrl's best frîend
There may come a tîme
When a hard-boîled employer
Thînks you're awful nîce
But get that îce
Or else no dîce
He's your guy when stocks are hîgh
But beware when they start to descend
It's then that those louses
Go back to theîr spouses
Dîamonds are a gîrl's best frîend
I've heard of affaîrs
That are strîctly platonîc
But dîamonds are a gîrl's best frîend
And I thînk affaîrs that
You must keep lîaîsonîc
Are better bets
If lîttle pets get bîg baguettes
Tîme rolls on
And youth îs gone
And you can 't straîghten up
When you bend
But stîff back or stîff knees
You stand straîght at...
... Tîffany's
Dîamonds
Dîamonds
I don 't mean rhînestones
But dîamonds
Are a gîrl's best
Best frîend
- How did Gus like your number?
- He looked kind of grim.
Hand me my hat, please.
He is sweet, isn't he?
I really do love Gus.
You do?
There's no other millionaire
with such a gentle disposition.
He never wins an argument,
does anything I ask...
...and he's got the money to do it.
How can I help loving him?
I guess so.
Let's don't talk about love.
It reminds me of Malone,
the human ferret.
The police are here!
They have a warrant for your arrest.
It will get in the newspapers.
It will hurt my business.
Give up that tiara.
If I give it back,
it's admitting I stole it.
You're in a strange country.
You can't prove you didn't steal it.
Do you want to go to the Bastille?
- I guess I'll give it back.
- Where is it?
- In there.
- Çome on, let's get it.
- Oh, Dorothy. It's just not fair.
- No, of course not.
It's gone!
What? Are you sure
this is where you left it?
Yes. It's been stolen!
It's been stolen!
The cops!
Sister, we really are in a jam.
Çome on.
- I'll give you a boost.
GUS: Lorelei? It's me, Gus.
- He's your best chance.
- He can't boost me any higher than you.
GUS: Lorelei?
Just a minute. Either you hock
your stuff or get the money from him.
- How much will a tiara cost?
- 15,000 at least.
- That'll take an hour and 45 minutes.
- I'll take care of the gendarmes.
How?
You're not the only one here
with hidden talents.
GUS: Lorelei?
- Çoming!
You can come in now.
I've made up my mind.
We're through. Through forever.
- First I want to kiss you goodbye.
- Very well.
No, no. Not in front of everybody.
Çome on in, Daddy darling.
- This is your flight.
- Thanks very much.
- Until you finish customs...
- I want to speak with this gentleman.
- Well?
- Have a nice trip?
- My son, where is he?
- In the café where the girls work.
I explicitly told you
to stay with him.
He can't be left alone
with that blonde man-trap.
He's perfectly safe.
Right now, the man-trap is in court
explaining things to the police.
- That's better.
- We'll go when you're through customs.
I'll be right with you.
I beg your pardon.
Sir Beekman.
I heard you'd gone to Africa.
What'd you say? My name is
not Beekman, I'm Amos Finch.
All right.
Don't be in such a rush.
You're the chap on the boat?
I am.
- I was joking. Of course I'm Beekman.
- You're sure?
My plane leaves in an hour.
Do you know where to find Miss Lee?
- I think so.
- Give her a message after I've gone.
Tell her that I had no choice.
What I did, I had to do.
She'd understand
if she knew my wife.
Tell her I know money
means nothing to her.
- But I'll make it up to her.
- I'll tell her.
Thanks awfully, old boy.
It'll be a great favor.
- All right, take me to this young lady.
- Yes, sir.
- You will please swear, Miss Lee.
- Oh, judge, I never swear.
Swear to tell nothing but the truth.
Will you do that?
- Well, yeah. Thank you ever so.
- Sit down.
You are being held for trial
for a charge of grand larceny.
The plaintiff attests you stole
a headpiece of diamond, a tiara.
My goodness, judge,
a girl needs time to think.
You're so much more intelligent
than poor little me.
Won't you tell me what to say?
- Please to answer the charge.
- Yes, I was going to.
I was just thinking. It was
all a terrible misunderstanding.
You see, sometimes life is
very hard for a girl like I.
Especially if she's pretty
like I and has blonde hair.
We can do without the philosophy.
Facts only.
Mr. Pritchard is a little confused
and would like to ask a question.
I can hardly blame him.
What is it?
He doesn't see well, and would like
to look at Miss Lee more closely.
Permission granted.
Mr. Pritchard, how nice to see you!
Yes, Miss Lee...
You are Miss Lee, aren't you?
That's who I am, all right.
But my friends call me Lorelei.
I hope you're my friend. I love to
have handsome gentlemen be my friends.
My eyes are not that good.
- Have you ever heard me sing?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- I've not had the pleasure.
Thank you ever so!
A kîss on the hand
May be quîte contînental
But dîamonds are a gîrl's best frîend
A kîss may be grand

This is not a cabaret!
Stop that woman!
Tîffany's!
Cartîer!
Black, Starr, Frost, Gorham
Talk to me, Harry Wînston
Talk to me
Did you hear me? Stop her!
Get her to the witness stand!
The rest of you take your places.
You are fired!
How could my son get mixed up
with that type of girl?
Now, young lady,
we're here to dispense justice.
Not to watch a cabaret show.
You understand me?
- Yes, judge.
- All right.
Did you or did you not steal
the diamond tiara?
Oh, no, sir. I did not steal it.
The fact is, Lady Beekman's
husband gave it to me.
Your Honor! The defendant is not...
- You have evidence for this case?
- Yes, I have.
Before he talks,
could I explain something?
JUDGE: Go ahead.
I have a friend named Dorothy,
and she's a really good friend.
She knows I would never do
anything really wrong.
- Do you have to say this?
- Yes, sir, I do.
There's a young man that Dorothy likes.
She's very fond of him.
Dorothy would never speak
to this man again...
...if he did anything
to hurt me, Lorelei.
So I think this young man had
just better know that...
...Dorothy thinks
she's in love with him.
Mr. Esmond, I resign.
I just quit the case.
Are you crazy?
But I like it that way.
Judge, I've changed my mind.
I haven't anything to say.
JUDGE:
This becomes more and more confusing.
But the solution is simple.
My decision is this:
The property will be placed
in this court's custody...
...until the owner can be established
by an affidavit from Lord Beekman.
Now, Miss Lee, you will
give me the tiara.
- But I can't.
JUDGE: If you refuse, you go to prison.
I just haven't got it.
It was stolen.
I think I know where that thing is,
and who's got it.
JUDGE: Who are you?
- A private detective.
Give me two policemen and wait
half an hour. I can settle this.
Anything would be better than this.
Go with him.
There he is.
What's that?
What's he saying?
Speak English!
This is outrageous!
I'm a British subject!
This is positively outrageous!
I demand a lawyer.
What?
- What did you say?
- He says remove your hat.
Why doesn't he say so?
Send for the consulate.
- I'll take this.
- Give that back.
This is Sir Francis Beekman.
And this is the missing tiara.
- That's mine!
- Miss Lee will be glad to return it.
I certainly would.
I believe His Honor asked
Miss Lee for the tiara.
- I say, that isn't...
- I wouldn't go into that, Mr. Finch.
Finch?
- Miss Lee.
- Thank you.
- Your Honor.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Monsieur Pritchard.
- Thank you. Your Lordship.
Thank you.
Çase dismissed!
Five minutes ago
you said you'd marry me.
- That's before Dorothy phoned.
- What made you change your mind?
She just said everything's okay now.
I don't quite understand...
Oh, dear. Hello, Father.
Hello, son.
I know why you're here, and I don't
care. I'll make her marry me.
That's wonderful.
I presume this is the young lady?
A pretty girl. American?
Yes, except on my parents' side.
They're Irish.
I'm delighted. I've wanted to
see you married for a long time.
Anybody but that monster,
Lorelei Lee.
But, Mr. Esmond, I am Lorelei Lee!
Pretty early to start teasing
your father-in-law.
- What's the matter, Father?
- Nothing. I can take a joke.
What joke? This is Lorelei.
This is nothing to joke about.
I don't have my driver's license
with me, but take my word for it.
Look, that's I.
See my name?
FATHER: Oh...
I'm too old for this sort of thing.
- I don't understand.
- You don't understand?
How do you think I feel with
thousands of Lorelei Lees around me?
But you're not marrying any of them!
I love her. I love her very much.
I've never felt...
Oh, shut up! Young lady,
you don't fool me one bit.
I'm not trying to.
But I bet I could.
You might convince this jackass,
but you'll never convince me.
- That's too bad. I do love him.
- Çertainly. For his money.
No! Honestly.
You expect me to believe that you
aren't marrying him for his money?
- It's true.
- Then why do you want to marry him?
- I want to marry him for your money.
- There!
That's why we need his consent, silly.
We're getting down to brass tacks.
You admit you're after money.
No, I don't.
Aren't you funny?
Don't you know that a rich man
is like a pretty girl?
You don't marry her
just because she's pretty.
But, my goodness, doesn't it help?
Would you want your daughter
to marry a poor man?
You'd want her to have the most
wonderful things in the world.
Why is it wrong for me
to want those things?
Well, I concede that...
Say, they told me you were stupid.
You don't sound stupid.
I can be smart when it's important.
But most men don't like it.
Except Gus.
He's interested in my brains.
- No, that much of a fool he's not.
- You've changed your mind?
- I just don't know what to tell you.
- Daddy?
Not you. I guess I mean "Sonny."
Give me three minutes
alone with your father.
- Run along, darling.
- Yes, dear.
Now, about what we were speaking.
There's a great deal to consider.
I just can't answer...
Please, take your places.
Remember, on your wedding day
it's all right to say yes.
We're just two lîttle gîrls
From Lîttle Rock
And we lîved on the wrong sîde
Of the tracks
But at last we won the bîg crusade
Looks lîke we fînally made the grade
Square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don 't lose theîr shape
Dîamonds
Dîamonds
Dîamonds are a gîrl's...
Dîamonds are a gîrl's...
... best frîend
