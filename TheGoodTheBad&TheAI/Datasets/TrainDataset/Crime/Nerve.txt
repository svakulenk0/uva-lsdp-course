"...to move out
and leave Staten Island forever."
I'm reading the news,
thank you very much.
Oh, you're reading the
news, you're such a good liar.
Seriously, how do you
know I'm stalking JP?
Because I know
you very very well.
Oh, wait, did you tell your
mom about CalArts yet?
Yeah, I told her. She's super excited
for me to move across the country
and go to a really
expensive art school.
- No.
No, I haven't found, I haven't found
the right time to tell her.
-
-
-  What's Nerve?
-
Nerve is a 24-hour game,
like Truth or Dare, minus the Truth.
Watchers pay to watch.
Players play to win, cash and glory.
Are you a watcher or a player?
Are you a watcher or a player?
This looks very sketchy.
Is this legal?
Just do it, just sign up and watch,
time's ticking.
Okay, signing up.
Look, this is me
signing up to watch you.
Vee, you have to
sign up and watch me.
It's very important
that I have Watchers.
-  Hey!
- I gotta go. My mom just got home.
- I'll sign up after breakfast,
- I promise.
- Bye.
I mean Syd hasn't gotten
into any schools yet.
And she doesn't even care.
You know what, Sydney doesn't
have to care, she has a trust fund.
And you have something far
more valuable than that.
Here we go.
You have drive, you have focus.
You have a scholarship
to a local college.
And even though we
can't afford the dorm,
you get to have me
as your new college roommate.
Actually, I, um... I have
kind of a cool idea about that.
What if we fixed up Mike's room
and listed you on Airbnb or something.
Maybe it's time we finally
go through his stuff
and maybe give some of it to Goodwill.
- And I could give you some space.
- I don't want space.
I just want you.
Okay.
I'm totally down with commuting.
I can get my reading
done on the ferry.
Yeah?
That'll work, right?
Yeah.
Let's say, "Go Cougars"
on the count of one, two three!
Go Cougars!
Let's go, Cougars!
Let's go, Cougars!
Let's go, Cougars!
- Hand me the zoom lens.
- Here.
Doesn't it feel a little unbalanced
if every single yearbook
photo is of JP Guerrero?
It's not my fault he's on the team.
-  Alright, boys, here we go!
- Here.
Alright, careful, careful.
-
- Let's hit it, JP!
Alright, let's go, let's go!
Come on!
Watch out, watch out, watch out!
Yeah, you got it. Alright, be careful!
Let's go, Cougars!
Let's go, Cougars!
Let's go, Cougars!
Liv, Liv!
Let's show them
what we got, Cougars!
Okay, let's play foot...
Where you goin', Syd?
Okay, we lost our cheerleader.
Alright, let's show
'em what we got VHS!
Are you ready,
remember what to do?
Okay.
- Okay, you're on!
- Hey, watchers!
It's Syd Baby. I'm counting on you
to get me to the final round.
So don't let me down
and I won't let you down, I promise.
Let's go, VHS!
Go, dude, show 'em what we got!
Show 'em what
Staten Island's really about!
Go cheer, baby!
Ooh, how
'bout that ass, though?
Okay, thank you, Sydney.
Whoo!
Ahh, you guys dared
me to eat dog food.
You can do this,
just don't think about it.
Ohh, this is so
gross, this is so gross.
-
-
-
- I have so many Watchers now.
- Yeah, you do, girl!
I just need to get in that little
box thing. Who's winning now?
Apparently, this guy named Ryan.
I guess he put peanut butter on his junk
and let his dog lick it off.
- What?
- I could do that.
But you don't have a dog.
- I could still do it.
- Or a dick, Liv.
They're coming
up with your next dare!
What is it? I need something flashy
like the peanut butter thing.
Hey.
Oh, my God, how weird.
How do they know you're
afraid of heights?
- What?
- That's what they do, it's easy.
They just take all your
info from your old profiles
and put it in your Nerve profile.
-  That's so creepy.
- You just got suspended.
- I thought you were done playing Nerve.
- Hell no!
The girl who won Seattle now
has millions of followers.
- She is insta-famous.
- Who cares?
I care, Vee.
I don't expect you to understand.
I'm an adrenaline junkie.
You like to stay within your
comfort zone, that's fine.
That's not true. What about
that pole dancing class we took?
Vee, I dragged you there
and you sat in the corner and watched.
- I'm a visual learner.
- Why are you attacking her?
- I'm not attacking her, Tommy.
- Yeah, you are.
Life is passing you by.
You need to learn to take a few
risks every once in a while.
- I do take risks.
- Really?
Okay, fine. Let's just say,
hypothetically, you're playing Nerve.
What'd be a good
Nerve dare for Vee?
Make out with JP.
Baby steps, baby steps.
Just talk to JP.
What?
He probably likes you, too.
You'll just never know
if you don't talk to him.
And then everybody that's watching you
they would just go on and vote.
Who wants to see
Vee mackin' on JP?
- Oh, my God!
- You guys!
All who wanna see
Vee macking on JP say "Yes."
Yes!
Yes, yes.
- I assume, "No"?
- Abstain.
- Thank you.
- Alright, you've been dared.
Do you accept your dare, Vee?
Say, "Yes."
Say, "Yes."
What's the point?
We're graduating, I...
- All you have to do is say, "Hi."
- I don't want to say "Hello" to him.
Fine. I love you so much, Vee,
but you're a Watcher.
So watch me do it for you.
- No no no, Syd, Syd, Syd.
- Just watch.
No, no, no, Syd, no.
Yeah, Sydney!
Why don't you show us
the front next time?
You first, Chuck.
I hear it's really big.
Guess it's average.
- Hey, JP.
- What's up?
I was wondering, do you
have a girlfriend right now?
No!
It's not for me, it's for a friend.
Well, which friend?
No, she's not my type.
You're not nearly
as hot as you think you are.
-  Yes, he is!
-  And you are a douchebag.
No, don't go, come on.
Vee, Vee!
Just let her go.
Not cool, Sydney.
I'm just trying to help her.
- Let's not help her.
- She'll figure it out.
The two Players with
the most Watchers
by the end of regulation
will advance to the final round
Watchers can watch from anywhere
but they are encouraged to film live.
So don't be alarmed.
There are three rules:
One, all dares must be
filmed on the Player's phone.
Two, there are only two
ways to be eliminated.
Thank you for keeping Nerve a secret.
Good luck, Player.
Vee, you have
to sign up and watch me.
...for account information, press one.
- Tommy.
-
We have to go to Colonnade Diner,
we have 15 minutes.
I signed up for Nerve
and that's where my first dare is.
What do you mean,
you signed up as a Player?
Oh, man.
What, is that so hard to believe?
You know that some kid supposedly
died in Seattle playing Nerve?
I don't buy that. If kids were dying,
the game would be shut down.
No, they can't shut it down.
There's not a single server.
What does that mean?
Everybody that logs onto
the game becomes a new server.
So it's impossible
to turn the game off.
How do you even know
so much about this game?
You've never even played.
Look, I spend a lot of time
on the dark web, alright?
Oh a lot of time on the dark web?
- Is that right, hacker boy?
- Yes, that is right.
You're only accessing ten percent
of the Internet, you know.
Why are you even doing this?
Seriously, it's dangerous.
Is it because of Sydney?
This is not about Sydney. I'm...
It's just not like you.
That's the point.
A stranger, Vee,
I'll give you 100 dollars.
Okay, Okay.
You're just gonna
kiss some random person?
He has a girlfriend.
Just kiss that guy.
- Okay, I'm gonna kiss that guy.
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
Gonna do it.
Or that guy, he reads.
Well, make a choice, clock's ticking.
- Hi.
- Hey.
I'm kissing that guy.
Okay, you sit here,
tell me when you're rolling, okay?
Okay, it's Mission Impossible now?
Just go.
To...
that's my favorite book.
Really?
Please, tell me they get to
the lighthouse in the end.
Um...
Actually, don't tell me.
Okay, just tell me real quick.
Yeah, they do, but that's,
that's not really what it's about.
The lighthouse means something
different to each of the characters.
It basically represents the
thing they want most in life.
And I'm sorry that I'm totally
geeking out and ruining the story.
No, I was the one who asked.
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three Mississippi,
four Mississippi, five Mississippi.
Done.
Done.Done.
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.
Oh, my God, I can't
believe I just did that!
- Gosh, why am I embarrassed?
- Did you get it?
Yeah, it was a miniseries,
I got all six episodes.
- Where did he go?
- I have no clue.
"Vee, $100 has been
wired to your account."
- Should I check?
- You should totally check.
Every time I look
into your lovely eyes
- What is he doing?
- I have no clue.
I see a love
that money just can't buy
- He's singing to me.
- No, it's a dare, it's a dare.
Anything you want
you've got it
Anything you need
you've got it
- Thank you.
- Good job.
You won your dare, congratulations.
Back at ya.
Mine was totally embarrassing,
but at least I got 100 bucks, right?
I'm sorry, I promise
I didn't know what was comin'.
- Do you mind?
- Sorry, I'm sitting here.
They just told me to
sit in that booth and... Sorry.
Some kid came by
and gave me that book.
yeah, my favorite.
Exactly because it's
on your Facebook page.
They know all the
information about you, Vee.
Your name's Vee?
- Short for Venus.
- I like that.
Her parents, they named her
after the Goddess of Love.
There's a Roman myth.
Yeah, I guess my mom was
expecting somebody else.
I dunno about that.
That was some kiss.
I got a game to play
but good night to you guys.
Thank you.
What?
Apparently the Watchers
like us together.
I mean, you can't even
go to the city, right?
You know, I can't go to the city, yeah.
I'm not even playing,
I was just doing one dare.
- Are you sure? It's 200 bucks.
- She's pretty sure, man.
He always tell you what to do?
No, no, he doesn't.
I'm gonna be outside
if you change your mind.
It's nice to meet you, Vee.
See ya, man.
He thought that
those were our fries.
- I could use 200 bucks.
- Vee, you're not going to the city.
You said one dare.
I'm sorry.
You know what,
Charles Manson was a singer.
I was hoping you'd come.
I'm just warning you, I don't think
I'd make a very good partner.
I'm not the daredevil type.
You should team up with
my friend Sydney actually.
She's obsessed
with playing Nerve.
But the Watchers want
me to team up with you.
The second I feel
uncomfortable, I'm out.
That's fair.
Okay.
Hold on.
Ladies?
-
-
Hey, where are you going?
Please, let me fart on you, please!
- Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.
- It's going up so fast!
- I know.
Who's your favorite Player?
Well, I mean, I was gonna
say you, but now I don't know.
Is that Vee?
Yeah, she's playing and she
has, like, a lot of Watchers.
Oh, my God, girl!
- Hey, try screaming.
- No.
You can do it, let it out!
There you go.
Alright, this is it.
Am I supposed to come in with you?
Doesn't say anything about that.
Well, thank you for the lift.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm tired,
so I'm probably just gonna
make my way back home.
Um... This is fun.
- Yeah.
- I just gotta... you know.
Okay.
You got three more steps.
If you keep up the exercises,
you're gonna get really strong on that.
Excellent.
Thanks, Miss.
Somebody's sending Vee money.
White people problems.
What is she doing?
And you have your receipt. So thank you
so much for shopping at Bergdorf's.
- You have a wonderful day.
- Excuse me, sorry.
Do you know where
I can find this dress?
-
- Your mom's calling.
Shit!
That's very expensive.
- Couture, fourth floor.
- Thanks.
- Please, don't undress the mannequin.
-
- Sorry.
- Would you like to try this on?
Mm-hm.
Let me see
if I have it in your size.
Thank you.
If you could hurry up,
I'm a little bit late for a party.
Cute.
Okay, right this way.
If you need anything else,
just let me know.
- Okay, thank you.
- Oh, alright.
Okay, dressed.
Hello?
- Everything okay?
- Everything is great, thank you.
Hey, what's your email number?
I mean your... What's your info?
Oh, this, this old thing?
- Vee!
- Oh!
Hey.
Hi.
You look very pretty.
Thanks, so do you.
I mean you look, you know,
hot, or handsome or...
Do you know what we're
supposed to do now?
The Watchers would like me
to complete your ensemble, mademoiselle.
Alright, how 'bout my
firstborn son, too?
What are you doing, Vee?
-
-
One for the city
and one for the Hamptons.
-
- Excellent choice, mademoiselle.
I'll wrap them up
for you right away.
I'll see ya downstairs?
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, alright.
What?
Excuse me, Miss, did you
move my clothes in there?
Of course not.
This is not happening.
Vee? Vee?
- Ian.
- Hey.
Did you take my stuff?
I mean, my wallet,
my clothes, everything's gone.
No, my stuff is gone, too.
- No.
- Okay...
- No, no.
- Come on, we have to make a run for it.
- Come on, let's go.
- I am not shoplifting!
We don't have a choice, come on!
Okay, technically, it just says
we have to leave the store.
Right?
Let's go.
Come on, come on, let's go!
Mmm...
Um...
Sorry, buddy, we need
to come through, sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me!
Let's go, come on, come on.
Whoa, whoa, hey, stop, stop, stop!
Please, tell me
these are our clothes!
- They kind of are.
- Are these stolen?
Receipt.
-
-
Hey, can I get the check?
Who paid for these?
Probably, one of the Watchers
with daddy's credit card.
-
-
- What?
- Look!
I'm sorry, was that
a Wu-Tang reference?
- Staten Island, represent!
- Okay.
Saint Mark's, ten minutes?
Hello.
Tommy, what
does Vee think she's doing?
Have you ever
parked a car in your life?
I got this, girl.
Why are you asking me,
I'm not her boyfriend.
Well, who's this
biker she's teamed up with?
I have no clue,
she just ditched me.
She's doing what she apparently
thinks is best for herself.
Yeah, and what exactly is that?
Sydney, Syd, Vee is in the top 10.
- What?
- She's in the top 10.
Tommy, Vee is in the top 10?
- Yeah, I know.
-
- How many Watchers does she have?
- Like 4,471.
- How many do I have?
- 6,806.
Oh, okay, I have a lot more.
Tommy, I really don't think
that Vee can handle this.
- Yeah, me too.
So get your ass to
this party and help me, okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm on my way.
What happens if I bail?
You lose everything
you've already made.
My mom would kill me.
What do you want to do?
Okay, just please no
fire breathing dragons or knives,
no clowns, no snakes, no skeletons.
What about panthers and tornadoes?
- No. No.
- No? Okay.
Whoa, what about this?
Just a tattoo of my dad.
He's gorgeous, honestly,
he's a nice looking guy.
Okay, I got a better idea, here we go.
- You're gonna draw it, no!
- Shh!
Be quiet, I gotta concentrate.
Back off.
Okay.
Can you do something like
this but less shitty?
- Yes!
- Yeah?
Right, I'm laughing
'cause it's good.
You guys, come on.
You have to trust us,
that's the whole thing.
Gotta trust me.
And dirt beard.
You can stop,
I think we're good, we're good.
The dare said it just had
to be bigger than a quarter.
This definitely feels
bigger than a quarter.
You're doing great, it's almost done.
Okay, no, I think wherever
we're at it, we can stop.
Hold on, I'm just
doing the "Y" in daddy.
- What?
- He's kidding, don't listen to him.
I really don't like that noise at all.
Ow...
Oh, my God.
Ow...
- Rocking that gold tooth.
- I forget the rest.
Okay, okay. Ow!
Wu-Tang fan, huh?
My brother used to listen
to them all the time.
Oh, yeah, you have a brother?
I had a brother.
He died right before
starting college.
I'm sorry.
How long ago was that?
Two years ago, he was 18.
This July, I'll be older than him.
Older than my older brother.
Ow, ow, ow. ow...
Hey, hey, come on.
Stay with me, stay with me.
He was just one of those people
that wasn't afraid of anything.
He always said yes.
He would laugh so hard if he saw me
getting a tattoo right now.
Boom, I'm done! Go to that mirror
and you celebrate my work.
- Come on, let's go.
- Do I want to see it?
- Yes, yes, yes.
-
- Hey.
-
- Yeah, hi, hey.
- We miss you down here at the club.
- You're watching Nerve, right?
-
Alright, I'm trying to find
out more about this Ian guy.
Ian, my dude, he playing with your
little girlfriend, Vee, right?
Could be you but you ain't playing.
Alright, yes, that's the problem though
but I'm looking on his profile
and there's just nothing on the guy.
- Well, did you try Google?
- Yeah, I tried Google.
I guess he's a ghost then.
Look, I need to take it to Aruba.
- Ah, what, no.
No way, you're
not ready for that shit.
- Yes, I know.
I'm not gonna mess up your rating.
I'm not gonna buy
guns or something, man.
Tommy no, not happening.
Look, I'm just worried
about my friend, please.
- Come on.
- Alright, I'll send you a pass key.
Alright, thank you.
A lighthouse?
I love it, thank you.
Well, a very wise person once said,
and this was earlier today,
they said that the lighthouse represents
the thing that you want the most.
So, whatever that is,
I hope you get it.
How many followers
does she have now?
I mean, to be fair,
you did tell her to take a risk.
This isn't what I meant, Liv.
This is ridiculous.
Sydney.
Okay, now they're
asking if I can trust you. Can I?
I have the perfect
tattoo picked out for you.
- No, okay, it's not a tattoo dare.
- What is it?
Oh, God, I love the internet.
What?
What?
-
- You don't have to do this.
- I can do this.
Hey, it's Vee, I'm not
here right now. So, leave a mess...
-
- Here we go.
Get to 60 miles per hour.
- That's it.
- Okay.
Alright?
Easy one, alright, let's do this.
What did that just say?
Blindfolded?
On the motorcycle.
Yeah?
- You're on your own with that one.
- Wait, I can't do this alone.
Come on, I need you
to help me navigate.
There's no way in hell I'm doing that.
I'm sorry, I'm out.
Thank you for tonight.
I had a lot of fun, got a new dress...
But... I'm good.
Stay, let's see what else happens.
Yo, what's up guys?
Veenus, I love your wardrobe.
Could you hold that for me?
Hold it, hold it up.
Great.
Hey, Ian, see you in the finals.
Who was that guy?
I don't know, just another player.
Vee come on, do this with me.
Please, I need you.
Look, you'd be in control.
Say, yes, just say yes.
You got next?
Who wants to challenge the champ?
- No way.
-  Hey, Liv, come on.
Sydney.
- Sydney.
-  What?
Oh, my God, you're
not gonna believe this.
What? Are you kidding me?
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
Now remember, you're my eyes.
Okay... Green.
Hold on.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
-  Just keep your eyes open.
-  Okay, okay, okay.
Hey, I know you're scared
but you gotta talk to me, Vee.
Okay, wait, no, no, no.
We got this, Vee.
What's going on, what's going on?
- Are we good, are we good?
- Taxi to the right, right, right.
- You've a sticker on your helmet.
- Thank you.
Okay, you're leaning to the left...
- Are you crazy?
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Okay, too far left,
right, right, right.
Okay, I think that worked, yeah?
Are we good?
- Actually, yes.
- Okay, keep doing that.
Just lean?
Yeah, lean left or right,
you are in control.
That's good.
No way she's doing this.
- This is good, you're doing great.
- Okay, speed up.
Yes, ma'am.
Okay, 30, we're halfway there.
Okay, the next light is green.
- The next light's green.
- Good, good, I got this.
Okay, next light is...
Come on, stay with me, what's going on?
Next light is green, faster.
No, no, no, no, no.
Green.
- We're doing this Vee.
- Sixty seconds.
- Are we clear now?
- Still clear.
Taxi, taxi.
Take it home, Vee,
take it home, Vee.
- Time check!
- Fifteen seconds!
- Speed.
- Forty-six, 47.
Hey, guys, we love you.
- Love you too.
- Let's go.
Fifty-seven, 58, 59, 60!
We did it!
- Oh, shit!
- Look out!
- Hold on!
- Oh, my God!
Vee's number one.
Oh, my God.
-
-
That was the craziest
thing I've ever done!
- You were incredible, I wanna like...
- I can't even believe we did that.
Oh, Vee, get it girl.
Are you hungry at all?
- Pizza?
- Pizza, I swear I was gonna say pizza.
You and I both know that
I should be in that box,
so please stop
holding back, okay?
because I'm not afraid,
so just give me a real dare.
- What's up, Syd, baby?
- What are you doing here?
You're a good Player.
You've got a lot of Watchers,
I got a lot of Watchers.
Maybe we could team up.
I don't need a partner.
Seems to work for your friend Vee.
- What up, Syd, you alright?
- Yeah, we're just talking.
Yo, Mad Max, why don't
you show yourself out, man?
Call me.
Break down.
Captain.
Party on, man!
Hey, Nancy.
Tommy, listen, I have a quick question.
How would I know if I'm being hacked?
-  What do you mean?
- Hacked.
Somebody's been depositing
money into my account under Vee's name.
That doesn't sound like a hack.
Normally, they would take money out,
if they were hacking you.
Thomas, what are you not telling me?
Oh, it must...
It might be Vee got a job.
- Yeah, that's probably it.
-
- Okay.
- Is it legal?
and she's doing great,
as you can tell with the deposits
but anyway, I gotta go, I'm writing
a paper right now on motorcycle safety.
- I'm gonna get going but...
-
- Bye.
-
Wanna take a ride?
- Is this a dare?
- Mm-mm. It's a carousel.
So, why are you playing Nerve?
Trying to help out my family.
Some things happened that
I wish turned out differently.
Like what?
This is just kind of
something I need to do, so...
- We got some paparazzi. Hide.
-
What, who is it?
So, that's Sydney.
Are you going to get it?
Ouch.
What's going on?
She's just been odd
recently, but, whatever,
you don't wanna talk about that.
If you want to talk about it I'm here.
I'm happy to listen.
I'm just tired of being
her sidekick all the time.
That's funny, you don't seem
like anyone's sidekick.
Could I see that picture again?
Sure.
- Wow.
- Yeah, guys go crazy for her.
No, I mean, the picture itself,
it's really good.
- Thanks, I took it.
- Yeah? You have a good eye.
I just, I can't picture you hanging out
with someone like this.
What do you mean?
I don't know,
she looks kind of insecure.
- Is that mean?
- She is, totally insecure.
I mean, she makes it seem like I'm the
one who's insecure but really it's her.
- It's exhausting.
- I'm sure.
She's at this party, most likely drunk,
and needs me to hold her hair back.
I'm just over it.
I mean, so are her parents.
They're constantly out of town, so she
has this revolving door of guys over.
It's sad actually.
Hey, that party.
Should we maybe go check it out?
What?
Why would I want to go to that party?
Maybe... show off your new tattoo?
Show Sydney that you're not
the person she thinks you are?
Hey, watch out.
Okay, okay, I got this, okay.
Go, Sydney.
Come on, Syd,
you're better than this.
- Come on, just turn around.
-  Come on, Syd, you got this.
Come on Syd, you started it,
you got to finish it.
Come on, you got it, you got it.
Sydney, deep breath.
- Just take a deep breath, Sydney.
- It's alright.
Get in here, she's gonna do it.
- I got this, okay.
-  There you go, come on.
There you go, there you go.
Come on Syd, you got this.
Liv, Liv, Liv, come, come, come.
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Oh, my God. Sydney.
-  Be careful, be careful, Syd.
-  What are you doing?
Oh, my God.
You don't have to do this, come back.
Shut up.
Sydney, come back.
-  You don't have to do this.
- Take your time, Syd, don't look down.
This is a stupid game.
Come on, we're right here.
You can always turn back, Syd.
Come on, come on, you got to film.
Sydney, it's not gonna
count unless you film it.
Don't worry about the phone.
She has to film it, she can't...
It doesn't count unless she
films it, she has to film it.
-  Just bail and come back.
-  She has to film it.
- No, but she has to film it.
-  Shut up, Chuck.
Oh, my God.
I can't, oh, my God,
I can't, I can't.
Sydney, you got to get up,
you gotta do something.
Stop yelling at me, stop.
She has to get it done.
Shut up.
This is gonna take too long.
You got to stand, you got to walk.
Shut up!
Shut up, Chuck.
You heard her, Chuck shut up.
She's gotta get it done.
She's not gonna get here in time
unless she gets up and walks.
She has to, she's wasting time.
Shut up both of you.
Come on Syd, you got this.
I can't, I can't, I can't.
I bail, I bail, I bail.
- You fail.
-  Someone help him out of there.
- Hey, come here, hold on.
-  You fail.
What are you doing, get over here.
Vee.
Hi, oh, my gosh, you guys
are so famous right now.
Oh, wait till Syd sees you.
- Where is she?
- Oh, you guys don't know?
Yeah, she tried to
walk across that ladder and just bailed.
- Is she out of the game?
- Yeah, let's get a drink.
Yeah, it wasn't pretty.
- Have you seen Sydney?
- Yeah.
Syd.
Oh, come on, Vee,
you never even spoke to him.
It's fine, certainly no surprise.
Sorry.
Yeah, I know it's not a surprise.
You know what's not fine though.
I almost died tonight, Vee,
and you were nowhere to be found.
I'm sorry, when you said
I should live my life,
did you mean I should live
my life in your shadow?
I was just trying to help you, Vee,
because you're the most
repressed person that I know.
Wasn't that why you keep me around?
Because I never tell you the truth?
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go.
I guess you don't tell me the truth.
Because you never told me
about how insecure I am.
Or about how I just have
a revolving door of guys all the time.
You never tell me that
but you've told everyone that tonight.
So please, Vee, go right
ahead and show us all
what a fiery little spark
plug you've become since lunch.
-
- Let's go.
Shots fired.
Don't walk away from me, Vee.
Wake up, this is a game.
Do you really think
that someone like him
is actually gonna be with you
when this is all done?
Wait, you don't know me.
Oh, I'm sorry,
you really like her now?
Yeah, I do.
Alright, come on Syd,
you're just drunk.
Clearly she has traded up.
Why do you have to be such a bitch?
Look at that, little Vee
finally speaking her mind.
You know why we're best friends?
I do whatever you want all the time.
We're friends because
I'm fun and you're boring.
The only fun thing about
you was your brother.
What is it you think?
That playing Nerve is just gonna
magically make you a different person?
That's not how life works,
you'll never be a player.
Right, right.
I know how much you love
living in the moment, Syd.
Well remember this
moment because you're one of those girls
who peaks in high school.
And you wake up one day still
living in Staten Island,
still screwing the same guys,
wondering what the hell
happened to your life.
If you want to know
where I am from now on,
sign up and watch me.
Wait, Vee, what are you doing?
Hey, hey, Vee,
you don't need to do this.
Look at me, come on, let's just go.
Let's bail, alright?
What do you have to prove?
Come on, please, let's go.
You got it, Vee, please.
Go, girl!
Oh, my God, Vee.
Whoa!
That'll take you into first, Vee!
That was messed up.
I can't deal with this
right now, I'm gonna go.
Vee, do you know that
he's played Nerve before?
What?
Yeah, it was his dare to get
you here and fight with Syd.
That's why he brought you here.
Look.
Do you still trust him?
Vee, wait, wait.
- Is it true?
- Is what true?
Did you take me here
as part of the game?
Answer me, is it true?
- What are you doing?
- It's more complicated than that.
I just lost my
two best friends tonight.
- I know.
- How much did you get for that?
No, no, it's not about
the money, alright?
But I promise,
I'll explain to you later.
Just don't even bother, okay?
I mean, Sydney almost died tonight.
- I almost died tonight.
- Vee, I know, I know.
This game is sick,
I'm going to the police.
Wait, no, no, no.
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?
I'm sorry, you can't do that, alright?
You can't go to the police.
Why not?
Because I'll lose the game?
No, it's not about that.
Vee, Vee.
You can't go to the police.
It's the last thing you wanna do.
Vee, wait, I was trying to hurt you.
It just got out of control.
-
- Move, just get out of my way.
Officer!
Officer, officer, I need help. I'm
playing this game, it's called Nerve.
And I'm worried that someone's
gonna get really hurt.
Snitch.
- That game, are they playing too?
- Yeah.
Dude, get out of this.
Is there a crime being committed?
No, but a kid could die tonight.
Look, here, it's all on
my phone, you can see.
What? What?
Snitch! Snitch!
- Mom?
- Mom!
All the money is missing
from our account!
- Wait, what?
- Vee, honey, are you in trouble?
Can you just please
tell me what's going on?
Okay, Mom, I'm gonna
fix this I promise.
Hello?
Vee, hello, Vee?
I'm sorry but I
got to win this game.
You broke the rules,
you are our prisoner.
The only way out is to
win the final round.
Go to the Staten Island ferry
and the Watchers will find you.
See you in the finals,
see you in the finals...
I'm coming for you, Vee!
- Vee, thank God, are you okay?
- Am I okay? No, I'm not okay.
You need to tell me everything.
- Okay, what the hell is going on?
- Come here, come here.
Why is this happening to me?
That guy, Ty, we both played
Nerve last year in Seattle.
We got a dare to hang from a
construction crane, 200 feet in the air.
The two of us
and this kid named Robby.
Five, four, three
Come on, Robby, that's enough.
-  Got it?
-  Shit, he's slipping.
Two, one.
Come on, grab my
hand, man, grab my hand.
Ty and I, we bailed
and we went to the cops.
We tried to get the game shut down
but they didn't do anything.
No, they just called it an accident.
Then, the Watchers
came after us for snitching.
But they messed with my dad's job,
they leaked photos of my sister online,
they stole our identities, Vee.
Me and Ty, we became
prisoners of the game.
Oh, come on, what
does that even mean?
It's the third category.
Watcher, Player, Prisoner.
I'm trapped.
The only way out is to win.
- So, you have to win.
- No... No, you do.
- What?
- Vee, you're a Prisoner now.
Okay, you and I, we're going to the
final round together and I'm gonna lose.
- What, no, you can't do that.
- It's already done, it's already done.
I told the Watchers to give me a dare
that's gonna knock Ty
out of second place.
It's gonna be me and you.
- I have to go.
- No, no, no.
Okay, I wanna take you
somewhere safe, let's go.
There has to be another way.
There isn't.
If it's not me in the finals, then
it's Ty and he'll do anything to win.
Just tell me we're gonna do this.
Hey, it's not your fault.
I just hope she's okay.
- Hello?
-
Oh, my God, Vee, where are you?
I'm so sorry.
It doesn't matter,
I'm just glad you're okay.
- Alright, guys, come on, let's go.
-  I can't.
What?
I have to finish this.
Are you insane?
Vee, what are you talking about?
It's never gonna end, I mean,
even if they live me alone,
they're just gonna do
it to somebody else.
We can't stop the game if we wanted to.
There's no one to stop.
It's just a bunch of anonymous people.
What if they weren't anonymous?
Ian's doing a dare that
will put him to the final,
Vee, do you actually trust this guy?
He's the person who got you
into this mess in the first place.
I got me into this mess.
Anything Ian's doing now
is to help me get out.
I know it sounds
crazy but I can do it.
I just need your help.
What do you need us to do?
Tommy, you said the game
is open source, right?
Do you think you
can change the code?
Hey, now climb the cranes.
Syd.
- Yeah?
- Use a pay phone.
-
-
Hang for five seconds.
Hang with one hand,
hang with one hand.
Shit.
One, two, three...
...four, five!
It's over here, Tommy.
You don't have a lot of time.
Okay, yeah, we're on our way,
we'll see you soon. How did it go?
- It went.
- It went?
Yeah, I think it's gonna work.
Yeah, better work.
What is this place?
Fastest Internet in New York City.
- Hey, Tommy!
-  Hey, HK, we made it.
- Let's get this started, you ready?
- Is the botnet up and running?
Yeah, of course.
We just gotta enter it into the system.
Oh and this is
Sydney, obviously.
Hey, welcome to the cloud.
Sucks you got axed.
Alright, let's take this game down.
Okay, how's this gonna work?
It's like Wikipedia,
where anyone can edit the code
but the majority has to approve it.
And the botnet can outvote everyone.
Yo, I got a army of bots
here waitin' for orders.
- Hey, Nancy.
-
- I want you to explain it to me.
I'm gonna give you an address.
Okay, if you meet me here,
I'll explain everything.
Ticket.
Better hurry up.
-
- Guys, it's starting!
Alright, how many
bots do we got in?
Not enough yet,
but we are getting there.
Players, show us your weapons.
HK, I need backup!
- Do it.
Start by just raising your gun.
Just raise your gun slowly.
Then shoot me in the shoulder,
I'll be fine.
What if I miss?
I don't know if I can do this.
Oh, come on,
just shut up and play the game!
Vee, you have to hurry, alright?
You have to do this,
this is the only way the game can end
and then you can walk away.
I'm not doing this.
Vee, don't, you can't...
I'll do it!
Oh, shit.
They're onto us,
they're blockin' all of our foreign IPs.
Tommy, do something!
Did y'all miss me?
And I say we do that dare again.
With someone who's
really ready to play.
Yeah!
Don't do it, Ty,
it's not worth it, man.
Stop!
Whoa, whoa, back up.
You have lost your mind,
pretty boy, get back!
Is this what you really want?
For us to kill each other?
-  Yeah!
- Of course that's what you want.
Kill 'em!
You think that takes nerve?
Why don't you take off your
masks and show yourselves, huh?
You, take off your mask.
Yeah, what's your name?
It's easy for you to
be brave in a crowd.
Don't you guys see
that you're all still responsible
for what happens tonight
even if you are just watching?
Oh, my God, are you really
believing this bullshit?
Play to win!
You guys really want one
of us to die, for a game?
- Yes, yes!
-
Then shoot me.
I dare you.
Okay.
Who wants me to shoot her?
Vee, what are you doing?
Who wants me to shoot her?
- Tommy, where's Vee?
- Alright, calm down.
What is this game,
I want answers.
What are you doing?
You better tell me right
now or I'm calling the cops.
- No, no cops.
- No, Nancy, calm down.
Do you want me to shoot her?
-  Shoot to kill, shoot to kill!
- Then vote "Yes."
Vote "Yes" if you
want me to shoot her!
- Don't say "Yes!", say "No!"
- You want me to shoot her?
You want me to shoot her?
Come on guys, "No!"
Guys, vote "No"!
You, vote "Yes", vote "Yes"!
Let me know, vote "Yes"!
Come on, let's have
a little bit of anarchy.
Alright, we're getting around them.
The IPs are coming in faster now.
Vee, we need to go, right now!
Oh. my God!
Okay, alright,
come on, guys, keep it going.
Oh, my God, Vee.
Vee, please, please.
No, no, no.
Look at me, Vee, please!
Go.
That's my real name.
My God!
Stop, it's okay, I'm okay.
It's okay.
Oh. my God!
Sorry.
You were in on this?
It was her plan, man,
her friend Sydney called me.
That's why I'm here.
The gun, what?
Blanks, bro.
It's fake.
Oh. my God!
You scared me.
We cool?
Yeah, we're free.
She's a badass, watch out for her.
-  That's it, the last Player's out.
-  Did we get it?
- We got it?
- And Nerve is officially offline!
We have gamed the game.
You guys are the dumbest
smart kids I've ever met.
- I'm so sorry.
- No no, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for bringing
you into all this.
I just wish that we
could've met some other way.
I don't.
Oh, man!
And you.
What a rock star.
Looks like I can get
all your money back.
They don't call me
Hacker Kween for nothin'.
- Really? Thanks.
- Yeah.
- Crazy first date, huh?
- Is that what that was?
By the way, my real name is Sam.
Well, it's nice to meet you, Sam.
It's nice to meet you, Vee.
Hey, Vee,
it's 28 degrees in New York!
