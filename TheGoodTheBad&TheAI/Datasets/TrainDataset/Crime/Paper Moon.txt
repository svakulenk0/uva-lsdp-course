Rock of ages cIeft for me
Let me hide myseIf in thee
Let the water and the bIood
-  From thy wounded side which fIowed
-
Be of sin the doubIe cure
Save from wrath
''Judge me, O Lord,
for I have waIked in mine integrity.
''I have trusted aIso in the Lord,
''therefore I shaII not sIide.
''Examine me, O Lord, and prove me.
''Try my reins and my heart.
''For thy Ioving kindness
is before mine eyes
''and I have waIked in thy truth.
''I have not sat with eviI persons,
''neither wiII I go in with dissembIers.
''I wiII wash mine hands in innocency.
''So wiII I compass thine aItar, O Lord.
''That I may pubIish
with the voice of thanksgiving
''and teII of aII thy wondrous works...''
- Loggins' funeraI?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ain't reIated, are you?
- ReIated?
We're Iooking for the chiId's kin.
Thought I saw some resembIance.
No kin?
None we know of, except in Missouri.
Seems you got the chiId's jaw.
No, just a friend of her mama.
If ever a chiId needed a friend...
''...wiII I bIess the Lord.
- ''Amen.''
- Amen.
Amen, Essie Mae.
I just know your ass is stiII warm.
WouId you Iike some water, Addie?
We'II get the chiId some water.
BIess you, chiId. I wanted
to pay my respects to your mama.
- I have to go. It's a Iong way to St Louis.
- St Louis, Missouri?
Yes, ma'am. I seII the Good Book.
Just spreading the Lord's good news.
Addie, don't you have your Aunt BiIIie
Iiving in St Joseph, Missouri?
Her poor mother's sister.
- Her onIy known reIative.
- That so?
If you're driving your chariot to Missouri,
you couId take her.
- I wouIdn't caII it a chariot, Reverend.
- I'II write the woman a Ietter tonight.
I have to think upon this. I may
have to make a few stops aIong the way.
- I never traveIIed with no chiId before.
- The chiId's got no pIace to go!
WeII...in the eyes of the Lord,
I have no choice.
HaIIeIujah!
- God works in mysterious ways.
- Don't He?
Come on, Addie, better get your things.
This nice man's taking you to your aunt.
- How come you're taking me?
- Huh?
- How come you're taking me?
- 'Cause I'm going that way, honey.
AIthough I do want to make just one stop
before we Ieave town.
- Got a IittIe business to do.
- You know my mama reaI good?
Oh, pretty good.
You just stay out here.
Don't you say a word unIess I ask you to.
- Mr Robertson?
- That's right.
- I'd Iike a minute of your time.
- Not buying today.
- Just want you to meet somebody.
- So what?
- TeII him your name, honey.
- Addie. Addie Loggins.
You done reaI fine. I'II be out in a minute.
- Ain't she a sweet chiId?
- No, she ain't.
Maybe not now, because she's sad,
with her mama dead and
your drunken brother hitting that tree.
What are you trying to puII? Get out!
-
-
You know who he is?
One of the biggest Iawyers in Kansas.
He don't favour the man with the money.
Know what's going to happen
to your brother? A Iawsuit against him.
Everything's going to be tied up in knots.
His money, his house, aII he owns!
IncIuding haIf this pIant.
Don't think that poor chiId ain't entitIed,
'cause she is.
Now, I was thinking,
$2,000 wouId be acceptabIe.
I'II give you 200.
- $200?
- $200.
It's a deaI.
There you are.
That'II be $67.54.
- You sure these tyres are new?
- $67.54.
Now, we'II have you to St Jo in no time.
- When's the next train to St Joseph?
- St Joseph? Let's see.
That'II be the 4.1 4. Change trains in
Kansas City and into St Jo at 9.52 a.m.
One chiId's price ticket.
$1 1 .45.
Send a teIegram to Mrs BiIIie Roy Griggs,
Cosmo Row, St Joseph.
''Train arriving 9.52 a.m. and bringing
Iove, affection and $20 cash.''
Make that $25 cash
and sign it just Addie Loggins.
Ten words, that wiII be 85 cents more.
That wiII be $1 2.30.
$1 2.30?
You'd better say in that message,
''Love, affection and $20 cash.''
''Love, affection and $20 cash.''
Here's your ticket,
and $20 for your Aunt BiIIie.
We got tiII 4.1 5.
I don't suppose you can wait here
by yourseIf, can you?
You hungry? Want a Nehi
and a Coney IsIand?
- Ain't you eating?
- I ain't hungry.
You worried about going on the train?
You'II Iike it.
You'II soon be at your aunt's
and aII your troubIes over. So, eat up.
- She don't know me.
- She wiII.
- She ain't going to want me.
- She ain't seen you yet.
Never even cared for my mama.
And she was her sister.
- Your mama was fine.
- Everybody says she weren't!
- Everybody don't know your mama.
- How good you know her?
Enough to know you can be proud
of the happiness she gave.
Eat your Coney IsIand.
You meet her in a bar-room?
- Where wouId you get that question?
- I hear taIk, wondering if you was my pa.
WeII, don't the worId
have a wiId imagination?
Eat your Coney IsIand.
You my pa?
Course I ain't your pa.
I'II get you some reIish.
Coney IsIand ain't no good without reIish.
Look, I know how you feeI. I Iost my ma
and pa. I don't know where my sister is.
I wish I couId teII you I'm your pa,
but it just ain't Iike that.
You met her in a bar!
Just because a man meets a woman
in a bar don't mean he's your pa! Eat up!
Then if you ain't my pa, I want my $200!
What's that?
I want my $200. I heard you
through the door, taIking to that man.
It's my money and I want it.
- You hoId on a second...
- I want my money. You took my $200!
- WiII you quiet down?
-  I want my $200!
- HoId on. Let me expIain something.
- If you was my pa, that'd be different!
- WeII, I ain't! Get that out of your head.
- I Iook Iike ya.
You don't Iook any more Iike me
than you do that Coney IsIand! Eat it!
- We got the same jaw.
- Lots of peopIe do!
- It's possibIe!
- It ain't!
- Then I want my $200!
- AII right!
We got the same jaw. I know a woman
that Iooks Iike a buIIfrog.
- That don't mean she's its mother!
- You met my mom in a bar.
You think everybody gets met in a bar
gets a baby?
- It's possibIe.
- Anything is. PossibIe don't make it true.
- Then I want my money!
- WiII you quiet down?
The troubIe with you is
you got no appreciation.
Maybe I did get a IittIe money
from that man and you're entitIed to that.
I'm entitIed to my share for getting it for
you. Where wouId you be without me?
Think them foIks wouId spend
a penny to send you east?
Who got you a ticket?
Who got you a Coney IsIand?
And threw in $20 extra, not to mention
You wouIdn't have had that without me.
I didn't have to take you, but I took you.
I think that's fair enough.
We're both a IittIe better off.
You get to St Jo. I get myseIf
a IittIe better car. Fair is fair.
Now, drink your Nehi
and eat your Coney IsIand.
I want my $200.
I don't have your $200 no more
and you know it.
If you don't give me my $200, I'm going
to teII a poIiceman how you got it
and he'II make you give it to me,
'cause it's mine.
But I don't have it!
Then get it.
How we doing, angeI pie? Going to have
dessert when we finish our hot dog?
I don't know.
Daddy, why don't we get Precious
a dessert if she eats her dog?
Her name ain't Precious.
I want my money back on this ticket
and send this teIegram, ''Trip deIayed,
''but I'm coming reaI soon!''
Lie quiet.
FoIks don't take to chiIdren
when they're doing business.
- Yes?
- Ma'am, is Mr Morgan at home?
Mr Morgan?
My name is Moses Pray,
Kansas BibIe Company. He'II know.
I'm sorry. Mr Morgan has passed on.
Oh, ma'am, I just...
I don't know what to say.
- What were you seeing him about?
- He ordered this here BibIe...
- RudoIph ordered a BibIe?
- The de Iuxe with the Iady's name on it.
- Lady's name?
- I expect a speciaI gift to a famiIy friend.
Under the circumstances, I'II give you
back his doIIar deposit with no obIigation.
Ma'am, I don't know how
to put into words the sorrow I feeI.
What name is on it?
I don't reaIIy know what name Mr Morgan
had put on it, ma'am. Let's see.
It's here somewhere. I've got it.
Here it is...
- PearI.
- ...PearI.
- I'm PearI.
- He must have got this for you, ma'am.
Yes, he bought it for me.
- Of course. You're not obIiged to take it.
- Of course I'II take it.
There's one thing. I toId him
I couId seII him a cheaper BibIe,
but he wanted the best, being the de Iuxe
with the Iady's name printed in goId...
- Oh, he wouId.
- ...bringing a baIance due of $8.
$8?
WeII, that's $8, minus the doIIar deposit,
- making it $7.
- I'II go get my purse.
- You're not obIiged to take it.
- Of course I am. He ordered the de Iuxe!
-
-
- Ain't you going to go to sIeep?
- Don't you want to hear Jack Benny?
No!
You're too young to smoke! You're going
to set this whoIe pIace on fire.
I now owe you $1 03.72.
RooseveIt said we're aII feeIing better.
- He did?
- Made me feeI good saying that.
- Better than I've feIt in a Iong time.
- Bet oId Frank wishes you was 21 .
You don't Iike me, do you?
No, I don't Iike you!
- Yes?
- Ma'am, is Mr Bates at home?
Mr Bates is dead. He died a week ago.
Passed over? I was just taIking to him
not Iess than a month ago.
- What was it you wanted?
- My name is Pray, Kansas BibIe Co.
I have this BibIe Mr Bates ordered.
- BibIe?
- Who is it? What's the troubIe?
- It's about Benjamin buying a BibIe.
- BibIe? What kind of BibIe?
Says he taIked to Benjamin a month ago.
I'm not sure of the dates.
Benjamin didn't go near that shop
for more than a month before he died.
I may be mixed up on the dates.
What company are you from?
Kansas BibIe Company, out of Wichita.
- I ain't never heard of it.
- Daddy?
Can't we go? I want to get
to church and pray for Mama.
Yeah, sure we can, honey.
Daddy was just fixing to Ieave.
This is my IittIe girI. It's just the two of us.
- My mama's gone to the Lord.
- So has poor Mr Bates.
Here's his deposit. Let us know
if there's anything we can do.
HoId on there! Wait one damn minute.
- He actuaIIy ordered a BibIe?
- He did. Here it is.
- In goId, for somebody named Marie.
- That's her. She's Marie.
She meant a Iot to him.
He wanted the de Iuxe edition.
- How much?
- That's...
- It's the $1 2 one, Daddy!
- $1 2?
Honey, we have to have a IittIe goodness
in our hearts in the circumstances.
If it'II make that woman happy,
I'II take it.
You owe me $85.7 4.
-
-
He's going to open the cIoset.
He'II say he's got to straighten it out.
- WouId you Iike to do business with me?
- Instead of paying me back?
I'II pay you back. WhiIe we head east,
how about we do business together?
You're Iooking at me
Iike I'm out to cheat you. It's business.
Take it or Ieave it. Turn off that radio.
You'II drive us aII deaf with it.
OK. Remember one thing,
I decide on the price.
Maybe you don't know French,
but there's finesse!
I never soId no BibIe for $1 2.
That man was a Iaw officer!
- We got it, didn't we?
- I don't care if we got it!
Don't you go making the decisions!
You just got to Iook Iike a pretty IittIe girI.
You ain't got a ribbon in that cigar box?
I got my mom's kimono in my suitcase,
Chinaman with umbreIIas.
That ain't what I had in mind.
You Iook reaI nice in that ribbon. First off,
I didn't know was she a boy or a girI.
- I'm a girI!
- WeII, it makes aII the difference.
- Ain't she got a sweet face? Somehow.
- We'II take a ribbon in each coIour.
- How much is that going to cost me?
- That'II be 1 5 cents.
Bought my grandchiIdren ribbons
just Iike this, Iast hoIiday.
GrandchiIdren? I don't beIieve it.
Break a five?
You can beIieve it aII right.
I'm just as oId as I Iook.
Now, here you be.
That's one, two, three, four, five.
This waIIet's about to bust inside. I give
you five ones, you give me that $5 biII.
- How many grandchiIdren you got?
- I got two granddaughters, nine and ten,
two grandsons near 1 6
and I got a grandson 35 years oId!
Come on! Why don't you
just give me a $1 0 biII?
Here's the five. The ones are there.
It won't be so quick to break.
- Six chiIdren!
- I got a daughter 51 !
I don't mean to be handing you no Iine,
but that's pretty hard to beIieve.
- You can beIieve it aII right!
- I'd have to see it. Much obIiged.
- See you again!
- Y'aII come back!
It just don't seem quite right.
Somehow.
- Yes?
- I'm Iooking for Mr StanIey.
- Mr StanIey's dead.
- I'm Iooking for Mr Warren M StanIey.
Warren's passed on, sir.
I was just taIking to him not more than
two weeks back. He ordered this BibIe.
He spent money on a BibIe?
- Yes, with the name EIvira in the corner.
- Why wouId he buy a BibIe?
He took fast to the idea. He Ieft a
baIance to it. Not counting the deposit...
- This one's aIready paid for!
- Huh?
Mr StanIey paid for the whoIe thing,
don't you remember?
- Afternoon, ma'am. Mr Huff at home?
- Mr Huff passed away a week ago.
Gee, I was taIking to him a month ago.
- What was it you wanted?
- My name is Pray, Kansas BibIe Co.
He ordered this BibIe for Edna.
- That's my name.
- You don't have to take it.
- I'II give you back his deposit and...
- Of course I want to keep it.
He bought me a BibIe.
I toId him I couId seII him a cheaper one,
but he wanted the best,
the best being the de Iuxe
with the name printed in goId Ietters,
bringing up a baIance...
Of $24!
$24. I'II get my purse.
What's your name, honey?
- Addie.
- What a sweet IittIe name.
- Addie Pray, ma'am.
- Addie Pray, I'm going to get you $24
and an extra five
for just coming to my door.
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.
Keep your sunny side up, up
- Let's give 'em some money.
- No.
Just a IittIe bit. We got $305.1 6.
It's a whoIe other business giving it away.
- They're poorIy!
- The whoIe country is.
- Frank RooseveIt said to care for peopIe.
- I don't care about RooseveIt.
- He says it!
- That so? He's taking care of himseIf.
You think he don't eat off siIver trays?
He couId eat off tabIe tops. He don't.
Because that wouId make him Iook
common. He ain't running this. I am.
- You don't say what we give away.
- It's mine, too.
- $200 beIongs to me, don't forget.
- You want it?
Put my share in my pocket and I'II take
you to a train station. You Iike that?
Find out where the nearest depot is. First
you overcharge, then you give it away!
- Where are we?
- PIainviIIe.
$1 2 for a BibIe! Then it's up to $24!
If I stay with you, I'II end up in jaiI!
- You can take me to the LincoIn depot.
- You bet I wiII!
- Where's LincoIn?
- There.
- You think I'm taking you over there?
- We'II hit one in SyIvan Grove.
- Where's SyIvan Grove?
- Here.
- That's through Lucas.
- You got to go some way!
- I'm not compIaining!
- You got to go through WaIdo, Luray...
Luray? Those are pretty good towns.
We couId do some business.
- We won't. We're nearIy out of BibIes.
- What? Why didn't you teII me?
- You Iook in the box!
- You've aIways got an excuse.
- You aIways bIame me!
- You shouId have toId me!
- We're running out of BibIes!
- We got to get new ones in Great Bend.
- Great Bend's the other way.
- We got to have BibIes, don't we?
We can veer down to Lucas and WiIson.
Veer off to Lorraine and Bushton.
We couId veer off to Hoisington.
Just have to keep on veering, that's aII.
- I'm getting hungry. You hungry?
- Uh-huh.
You go on back now.
I'II see you another time.
- Don't send me back.
- You got to go. Another time, I promise.
What you trying to keep secret?
You got diamonds and rubies in there?
- Go on, go on.
- OId Fido! Night-night, oId Fido!
- Woof!
- Woof, woof!
There it is!
- Much obIiged.
- Thank you, sir.
AII right, boy, you're next.
I ain't a boy!
- Don't Iet it bother you.
- It ain't funny.
- There's no reason to get that sore.
- He caIIed me a boy.
- He just got mixed up, that's aII.
- He Iooked me straight in the eye!
- So am I and I think you're beautifuI.
- You're just saying that.
You're as beautifuI as your mama
and she put every fIower to shame.
They feared she'd droop the tuIips
in HoIIand, and you got aII her Iooks.
- Then how come he caIIed me a boy?
- I don't know.
- Maybe it's 'cause of what you got on.
- What's wrong with it?
Nothing. It just...don't exactIy
make you Iook feminine.
Maybe we shouId get you fixed up.
Get you a new dress, a fancy new hat.
It wouIdn't exactIy hurt business either.
- You reaIIy think I'm pretty as Mama?
- Course I do.
- How much money's in the box?
- $405.1 6.
- Give me a twenty.
- What for?
Give me a twenty!
- Come on.
- Where?
To get us new outfits
with your money from Aunt HeIen.
- I don't have no Aunt HeIen.
- Sure you do. Let me expIain it to you.
- Yes, sir?
- An Ipana toothpaste and Sen-Sen.
- 20 and 5.
- 25.
- Yes, sir.
- There.

Thank you very much. I don't need a bag.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Bye now!
- How much is this?
- 35 cents.
- 65 cents makes $1 . Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Yes?
- A bottIe of purpIe toiIet water, pIease.
That'II be 25 cents.
There you go!
Lady, you made a mistake.
Huh? I give you $4.75.
- I gave you a $20 biII.
- Uh-uh. You gave me a five.
No, ma'am, it was a $20 biII.
You give me a five and I give you $4.75.
It was a $20 biII.
No twenties in with no fives.
- What's aII the turmoiI?
- This girI gave me a $5 biII.
I gave her a $20 biII, I know I did. It was
a birthday present from my Aunt HeIen.
She wrote ''Happy Birthday, Addie''
on it. You just go Iook and see!
That's it, right there! That's my $20 biII
I got from my Aunt HeIen!
- Give the chiId her $20 biII!
- I am.
- Give the chiId her $20.
- Yes, sir!

Sweet hot cotton candy!

There you are, IittIe girI. Cotton candy!
Cotton candy!

- Get your cotton candy right here!
- Mister!
UnIess you've got a $1 0 biII? I'II give you
the five back, aIong with the five ones.
There. Now, don't bother me any more.
Cotton candy!
Step up and get your cotton candy!
Six unusuaI Iadies
unveiIing the secret of passion,
found onIy a few years back in the
Egyptian tomb of Queen Neferetti,
and featuring
the Iuscious Miss Trixie DeIight!
- I had my photo took!
- You did?
- Come get a photo with me?
- Not now.
- It'II onIy take a minute!
- Not now!
- It won't be here after tonight!
- I can't heIp that.
- How many times wiII you see it?
- As many as I Iike.
- You've seen it haIf a dozen.
- I might see it more. Go pIay bingo.
- I don't want to.
- Write another Iove note to St RooseveIt.
- Maybe I wiII!
- Stop standing around checking on me.
I ain't about to Ieave some poor chiId
stranded. I got scrupIes, too.
- You know what that is, scrupIes?
- No.
But if you've got them, it's a sure
bet they beIong to somebody eIse.
And his name ain't Frank! It's FrankIin!
Hey there, I wondered where you got to.
Where's your pa?
- Is my picture ready?
- Sure. Excuse me, foIks.
Sit back in the moon there.
I'II be right with you.
Here it is. Hey now, I thought you were
going to sit in the moon with your pa?
He ain't my pa!
Hi! Get ready! SmiIe!
HoId it, hoId it!
BeautifuI.
I don't want you smoking
in the car tomorrow.
- What?
- I didn't say nothing. I'm Iistening to you.
There'II be two extra peopIe riding with us
and one don't Iike smoke.
- What extra person?
- What?
- What extra person?
- A Iady I'm taking to Topeka.
- I didn't know we was going there.
- You don't know everything.
What's the Iady's name?
Miss DeIight. Miss Trixie DeIight.
She's a reaI Iady!
I'm just giving her a ride!
That's what you're aIways taIking about,
heIping other peopIe out!
Don't drop nothing, Imogene.
Take care of those breakabIes.
Yes, Miss Trixie.
Morning! Car is right over here.
You better ride in the back.
Then I danced in TuscaIoosa and the
Mayor said the nicest things about me.
The newspaper ran a big photo on me.
I got a scrapbook on me from aII over.
TeII him about the time that man tried
to crack your head with a bottIe.
Imogene, you siIIy oId thing.
You know that's not true.
He wasn't going to hit me with no bottIe.
He was horsing around.
Ask me nice and I'II teII you about that.
TeII him about the time
you aImost got thrown in jaiI.
I don't understand it, Daddy. This IittIe
baby has to go winky-tinky aII the time.
- Don't worry. We'II stop here for dinner.
- We just stopped for her at Iunch.
Right, and now
we're stopping for dinner. Come on.
I ain't hungry.
- Want one?
- OK.
- How oId are you?
- I don't know, 1 5. Why?
- Just asking. Where are you from?
- Nowhere.
- You've got to be from somewheres.
- Down by Troy, I guess.
How Iong you work for her?
Ain't kept count. A year, maybe.
How oId you be?
Nine. She reaIIy do aII that dancing?
If you want to caII it dancing.
AII she do is waggIe her hips
and shake her behind.
How come she Ieave that job?
The boss try to make her put out
for his friends.
- She don't put out for free.
- She put out much?
Like a gum machine. Drop something in
and she'II put something out.
- How much she charge?
- Most she can get.
But she aIways asks for $5.
She ain't putting out for your pa, though.
Says she's going to get aII she can first.
He say he was my pa?
I heard him mumbIing something Iike
he didn't want to taIk about it. Ain't he?
I'm with him, ain't I?
How do you come to be with her?
She promised to give me $4 every week.
She ain't gave me nothing!
Except a nickeI or dime.
- Why don't you quit?
- Quit?
How I'm going to quit? And what if I do?
Ain't got no money to get home to Mom.
And what if I do get home?
They got hard times as it is.
My mama say, ''Go work for a white
Iady, she'II take good care of you.''
Know what I think? You know that
white speck on top of chicken doo-doo?
That's the kind of white she is.
She's just Iike that IittIe white speck
on top of oId chicken shit!
I just Iove it, Iove it, Iove it!
AII this white. It is absoIuteIy the
proper thing for my kind of appearance.
You need a new dress. The right dress
makes aII the difference in a face,
especiaIIy since you've got
the right kind of bone structure.
Oh my, oh my, Daddy,
but wouIdn't you Iook handsome
behind the wheeI of that?
Everything is in the bone structure.
A person can teII his whoIe Iife
by his bone structure.
I tried pushing her out of a window.
I think there are bugs aII over.
I just hope there's no snakes round here.
I think we ought to go now, you know?
Thank you.
Now, hurry... Oh!
Come on, get those things in there.
Don't break anything, either.
- Let's go!
- Baby's got to go winky-tinky.
Don't worry.
- Hey!
-
Come on, we're ready.
- Come on!
- I ain't ready!
You don't Iook busy. Come on.
- I ain't coming!
- You Iisten here...
- No, I won't Iisten here!
- What's up with you?
I want to sit in front.
How come we ain't working no more?
We're on vacation. Miss DeIight and me
are in front because we're grown-ups.
That's where grown-ups sit!
ChiIdren do not teII grown-ups
what to do with their Iives.
She ain't my grown-up
and I ain't sitting no more in the back.
- Not for no cow!
- Keep your voice down!
Miss DeIight ain't no cow.
She has a high schooI dipIoma!
And she's got to go to the bathroom,
so get to the car!
She's aIways in the bathroom!
She must have a bIadder Iike a peanut.
I ain't getting back in that car
tiII she's out of it!
What's up? Daddy says you're
wearing a sad face. That ain't good.
How wouId you Iike a coIouring book?
You Iike Mickey the Mouse?
Oh! Son of a bitch!
Come down to the car and Iet's aII
be friends. You see me smiIe?
Let's see you smiIe Iike Aunt Trixie.
Come on down with MademoiseIIe.
Kiddo, I understand how you feeI.
You don't have to worry.
One of these days you're going to be just
as pretty as MademoiseIIe, maybe more.
You aIready got bone structure.
When I was your age, I didn't have any.
Took me years to get bone structure.
Don't think that's not important.
Nobody started to caII me MademoiseIIe
tiII I was 1 7 and getting bone structure.
At your age, I was skinny.
Never thought I'd have nothing up here.
You're going to have them up there, too.
TeII you what, want me to show you
how to use cosmetics?
I'II Iet you put on my earrings.
You'II see how pretty you're going to be.
I'II show you how to make up your eyes
and your Iips.
I'II see to it you get a IittIe bra,
or something.
Now, pick your ass up, sit in the back,
and cut out the crap, you understand?
You're going to ruin it, ain't you?
I don't want to wipe you out and I don't
want you wiping me out, you know?
So I'm going to IeveI with you, OK?
With me, it's just a matter of time.
I don't know why,
but somehow I just don't manage
to hoId on reaI Iong.
So, if you wait it out a IittIe,
it'II be over, you know?
Even if I want a feIIa, somehow or
other I manage to get it screwed up.
Maybe I'II get a new pair of shoes,
a nice dress, a few Iaughs.
Times are hard.
If you fooI around on the hiII up here,
then you don't get nothing,
I don't get nothing, he don't get nothing.
So, how about it, honey?
Just for a IittIe whiIe?
Let oId Trixie sit up front with her big tits.
Hey, come on!
We're coming, and if you don't
find me a gas station soon,
this IittIe oId snowfIake's
going to wet her pantaIoons! Whoo!
Oh my, I aImost feII down!
Yoo-hoo! Look what we got!
Ain't she the sweetest thing?
Don't he Iook Iike a prince in this?
Imogene, get everything in here.
We got more room than Kansas!
Listen to the horn! BIow the horn, Daddy!
-
-
- Do it again!
-
This girI's sitting on the troIIey, takes
out a magazine and starts to read it.
She ain't read more than two pages
and, reaI sIow,
she takes her stockings down
and takes off her shoes.
She turns the stockings wrong side out
and puts them back on.
AII the passengers are wondering what's
going on. This oId guy asks her,
''I saw your strange procedure.
What were you doing?''
She said, ''I was reading this magazine
and found it to be such hot stuff,
''I feIt compeIIed
to turn the hose on myseIf.''
Have they a room with a canopy bed?
- Have you a room with a canopy bed?
- No, but I got one with a firepIace.
I'd Iike that one, Daddy.
It ain't no canopy bed,
but it sure opens up
a whoIe new can of peas!
- Can of peas! Ain't that cute!
-
How's that?
Imogene, heIp the boy with these things.
Give them 234, 235 and 236.
They're fixing the eIevator.
First fIight up, if you don't mind.
It's aII right. Thank you.
- Can of peas!
- What was that?
WeII, you know,
canopy, can of... They rhyme.
I see! Can of peas, canopy. I get it now.
I knew you'd get it.
There's a rip in the seam of that dress.
Get it sewed up. And wash these hose.
- Yes, Miss.
- My bath ready?
- Yes, Miss Trixie.
- You've made it awfuI hot IateIy.
- I knows you Iike it hot, Miss Trixie.
- Not that hot! Finish up aII these things.
- Come back in an hour and dry me off.
- Yes, Miss Trixie.
- What you doing up there?
- I got an idea. Come on!
- What kind of idea?
- Come in here and I'II teII you. Go on.
What wouId Miss Trixie do if
somebody offered her $25 to put out?
You crazy? For that much money,
she'd drop her pants in the road.
That's what I figured. You want to get
away from Miss Trixie? If you heIp me,
I'II give you money to get home.
- How much money?
- $30.
- When do we start?
- Tomorrow.
Miss Trixie, you know the man
at the desk who checked us in?
Yeah?
He teII me he'd pay $25
just to have a good time with you.
What?
That IittIe two-bit-bum nerve of that guy!
I don't know.
AII I know is what he toId me.
$25, huh? I'd sure have to see
the money to beIieve it.
There you go. You come back
and see us again reaI soon.
Hmm!
- I'II have a Juicy Fruit gum, pIease.
- Here. Want I shouId chew it for you?
You know that red-headed Iady,
named Miss Trixie DeIight?
- She thinks you're reaI cute.
- Says you and who eIse?
Honest! She says you're better Iooking
than Dick PoweII.
- The Iady's got good taste!
- Thought you'd Iike to know.
Just a minute!
Give these to her.
Say they're with FIoyd's compIiments.
She'II Iike that!
Maybe you shouId write her a note.
What kind?
I thought men aIways wrote Iadies notes
when they send presents.
Maybe you shouId ask for a date.
That'd tickIe her.
Yeah, maybe I ought to.
Say, she's not married, is she?
She don't even have a reguIar boyfriend.
The man with her yesterday is my daddy.
He's her manager. She's a dancer.
I figured she was something Iike that.
Whereabouts does she dance?
- Lots of big pIaces. She's a star.
- How about that!
Why not print it? She Iikes that.
Print it, huh?
''Some sweets for the sweet.
''Some girIs say I'm a smooth dancer
myseIf. How about trying me out?''
- You sure this is going to work?
- I don't know, but we'II give it a try.
Throw this in the drawer, wiII you?
Keep your fingers crossed.
-
- It's Addie.
I got a message from Moze.
He had to run over to HaynesviIIe.
- He won't be back untiI suppertime.
-
I think he had to get something fixed
on his car. He'II be gone aII day.
OK!
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
- What you having?
- WaffIes.
I aIready ate. I had waffIes, too.
Sure are good, ain't they?
They ain't bad for waffIes.
Mr Moze, Miss Trixie don't feeI so good.
She's staying in bed today.
She'II see you at supper.
She's sick? I'd better go up there.
She ain't reaI sick. Ain't no worry.
She's having her Iady's time.
Oh... TeII her
I'II see her this evening.
Just wanted to say good morning. I think
I'II go upstairs and poIish my shoes.
-
-
-
-
-
-
HeIIo, Cupid.
Miss Trixie wants to see you.
Says it's important. Room 235.
She does, does she? When?
- Now.
- I can't get off right now.
It's important.
You teII her I'II come up Iater tonight,
when the moon is fuII.
But you can't.
She won't even be here after tonight.
She won't even be here after today.
She won't? WeII...
You won't be sorry.
I couId go up for a few minutes.
What's that room number?
Room 235. She's waiting for you.
OK. TeII her I'm on my way up,
sweetheart.
He's coming! He's coming!
-
- Sheikh of Araby.
WeII, don't you Iook purty!
WeII, come on in, honey.
Come on.
-
-
-
-
I'm going.
The key! Give me the key!
Mr Moze wiII kiII them both, I knows it.
- Wait for me here!
- OK.
- Moze!
- What's the troubIe?
- Better go up to Trixie's room right away!
- Is she sick?
No, she's not. Just do what I teII you.
And take the eIevator!
Don't knock! Use a key!
Your daddy going to kiII that man.
- He'II cut him up pretty bad.
- Moze wouIdn't do that.
Down home, when a man come home
and hear a man in bed with his wife,
he just go to the wood piIe
and get his doubIe-bIade axe
and go in and chop them up.
FoIk say he cut them up
just Iike kindIing wood.
- Addie, we're Ieaving!
- Now?
Right this minute!
I don't know why that girI
did such a thing to me.
I'd have done aImost anything
for that girI. It just ain't fair.
- I reckon she's been carrying on a whiIe.
- From the start.
- There were other men?
- Lots.
Why didn't you teII me?
I just knew you wouIdn't beIieve me.
- Promise me one thing.
- What, Moze?
When you grow up, don't be the kind
of woman who deceives men.
- Promise me that.
- I promise, Moze.
Moze... Moze, pay attention.
- What is it?
- I seen something pecuIiar.
- That man in there.
- What man?
- Standing by the door.
- What's pecuIiar about him?
He's got a roII of money
couId choke us both to death.
I'm not up to anything.
He's got a notebook
and aII that money.
He keeps going outside
and coming back in again.
BootIegger. No question about it.
You think we might
do business with him? Drop a wad?
We ain't done nothing for two months,
since Trixie. And we onIy have $21 2 Ieft.
- Better way of doing business.
- What ways?
Oh, heaps.
Look, he's going out again!
- FoIIow him.
- Yeah?
I toId you, didn't I? FoIIow him.
Find out where he goes.
-
-
Thank you.
- What did you find out?
- He's got bottIes in a bin.
- How big's the bin?
- Like our car trunk. What's your pIan?
- Find out where he keeps his goods.
- There's a shack, but he didn't go in it.
How about a waIk
before Daddy puts you to bed?
Oh, goody!
He's Jess Hardin, a bootIegger.
WhoIesaIes across the county.
His brother's a big shot, too, but the girI
couIdn't teII me about him. I had to go.
- Where is it?
- Over there.
OK, come on.
Keep watch. Anybody comes,
cough reaI Iow. I'm going in.
- It may be Iocked.
- FoIks in the country never Iock things.
Don't you know that?
You Hardin?
That's right.
Conrad's the name.
Jack said I ought to Iook you up.
Jack who?
- Just Jack's good enough.
- Don't know no Jack.
He's running the biggest
whoIesaIe business in the state.
- You seIIing?
- Right.
Ain't interested in shiney.
I ain't seIIing shiney.
I deaI in bonded goods.
What kind?
- I have a good deaI on Three Feathers.
- How much?
It depends. You take 20 cases,
I'd Iet them go for $25 per.
Too much.
- You can't get it that cheap IegaIIy.
- Ain't IegaI here.
- AII the more reason it's a bargain.
- Give you $20.
Can't do it. Price is set down in Wichita.
How Iong before deIivery?
How's earIy in the morning?
You got it in the county?
That's right.
Where do I pick it up?
- OK.
- You Ieave some?
PIenty. He'II never miss it.
Moze! Moze, we'd better get.
- Here.
- It's aII fiIIed up!
Them's for me.
Get going!
Hurry!
Get up there!
Now, hoId on!
And make sure nothing spiIIs off!
WeII, you'd better go sIow. And hurry!
-  Easy!
- I got to turn corners, don't I?
Won't he miss his whiskey?
In a week. By then, we'II be in Missouri.
He can't do nothing
once we're in Missouri.
Where is it?
Brrm-brmm.
Scoot over!
- How much you get?
- $625.
$625 and he bought his own whiskey!
That's $625,
pIus the $21 2 we aIready got.
If we drop some waIIets
and do some twenties...
- What's that?
- Where?
- Behind us.
- I don't see nothing.
- Something's back there.
- Nothing but bIack.
- I thought I seen something fIicker.
- Nothing there.
- You put the money in the box?
- Uh-huh.
I'II be gIad to get out of this town,
I'II teII you that.
There it is again! Dad bIam it!
- Something fIickered, sure as heII!
- Nothing behind us!
Uh-oh!
I toId you!
- Who couId it be?
- Christ!
- Don't stop, keep going!
- I can't. The car's in front of me.
It'II be OK. Let me do the taIking.
- PIaying games with us?
- I didn't know who it was.
It's risky. Might get your tyres shot off.
Where are you heading?
Me and my girI are going to St Jo.
- Live there?
- Nearby.
What's your business?
Livestock. MuIes, horses, cattIe.
That's funny.
I heard you was a bootIegger.
No, sir. Must be a mistake.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Way I hear it, you just had
a transaction by the oId barn.
- Where wouId you hear that?
- A famiIy friend.
I don't know what you're taIking about.
I'm taIking about bootIegging.
I'm taIking about $625.
- Where's that?
- I don't have no $625.
I don't know what you mean.
I don't even know where the oId barn is.
WeII, I reckon we'II just have to expIain
a IittIe more thoroughIy, won't we?
Beau, you take a ride with these nice
peopIe. We're aII going back to town.
Damn!
Just when you think you got it made.
Just ain't made.
- You good at this?
- Not too good.
Not too good? BootIegger's sitting there
with his own IittIe game
and he ain't even good
at his own IittIe game.
Yes, sir, that is some good joke.
Found these on the seat.
Wasn't any money in the car.
I gone aII through it.
Livestock business, huh?
That whiskey's for a friend.
HoId out your hands.
I said hoId out your hands.
You heard me.
I didn't say put them down, did I?
CIean hands for Iivestock.
Don't Iook Iike they do much
but pIay a IittIe casino.
- It's for a friend. I didn't see no harm...
- Didn't see no harm?
Hear that, Beau? BootIegger cIaims
he don't know the Iaw.
I don't need no bottIes to book you.
Law says aII I need
is one IittIe oId drop.
And Iaw says you use a vehicIe
to transport aIcohoI,
the said vehicIe is confiscated
to be soId at pubIic auction.
Kiss that pretty IittIe car goodbye.
- HoId on! That seems rough...
- I didn't teII you to Iower your hands.
I teII you to Iower them, you Iower them.
You don't do nothing tiII I say.
Understand?
Yes, sir.
I aIready did. Ain't nothing in his cIothes
except him, and he ain't worth five cents.
She ain't got nothing on her, either.
You don't know what kind of troubIe
you're in. Better start thinking on it.
I got a case against you for possessing
and transporting whiskey.
I can think of a few other things.
Better face it. You're going to be here
for a whiIe working on the county roads.
With Iuck, you're out in six months.
Six more for infIuencing a chiId.
Maybe six years for that.
- Maybe we couId work something out?
- What's there to work out?
I sure don't Iike to send a man to the
road gang. AIways feIt sorry for them.
But I can't overIook the fact
that you've been paid $625
and you ain't teIIing me where it is.
I know you're a bootIegger,
so what's there for me to work out?
Let's cut this ring around the rosy.
Where's that...
...money?
You think I'm fooIing around?
I ain't fooIing around.
Maybe you'II come around in time.
Get a IittIe thirsty, get a IittIe hungry.
Time has a way with criminaIs.
- Don't it, Beau?
- Sure do.
It's aImost five. Somebody ought to be
stirring at the café. I'II step over there.
See if that famiIy friend is there.
I'II be back before Iong.
I got aII day, you know?
Got aII the time in the worId.
Sir, may I get my things, pIease?
OK.
Daddy, I need the shithouse.
There's one down the haII.
Daddy, I'm scared. I want you to come
and stand by the door.
AII right if I go with her?
Down there.
- Run!
- You crazy?
Where are we running? God!
Stop them bootIeggers!
- This is the craziest...
- Hurry!
I'm hurrying!
- BootIeggers!
- Oh, Jesus!
- I'II hit him!
- He can jump!
I couId've kiIIed him!
They couId've had me for murder!
- They're shooting at us!
- They're missing. Go!
We won't make it! Not in this car!
Every Iawman in Kansas wiII be Iooking
for it. We got to cross the river!
- Where's the bridge?
- Jesus!
- What?
- The bridge is the other way!
- What?!
- Hang on!
It's no good! We'II make it too easy
for them! We got to get off this road!
HoIy smoke!
- BIow your horn!
- Won't heIp. He can't puII off the road.
SeIIing whiskey to a sheriff's brother!
- Hang on to your hat! HoId on!
- Oh, God!
- You aII right?
- Uh-huh.
We heId them, but we got to get off
this road or we'II be in town.
Get that money out! You'II stop my heart!
We made it, didn't we?
Anybody to home?
Howdy.
Need to get rid of my car here.
I need to get rid of my car. Sheriff
wants to put her in an orphanage.
Know anybody that might want to swap?
How about that truck there?
We'II just Iet him chew on it a whiIe.
WeII, the rear tyres Iook new, anyway.
- The radio Iooks OK.
- Think it runs?
- It better!
- Where wiII we go?
Out of Kansas,
across the river to St Jo, that's where.
Here he comes.
Look at them aII.
I want a swap and three days' start
before you take it out.
It's aII IegaI. Got the papers here.
FiII out the form and you own it.
Ain't going to swap.
It's brand-new.
- That car ain't no good!
- What's the matter with it?
Can't hauI nothing in it.
If that's aII, you can seII it
and get two trucks to do your hauIing.
Ain't going to swap.
- RassIe you for it.
- You crazy?
If I win, we swap. You win, keep the car
and the truck. Quiet.
- What kind of rassIing?
- You name it.
- Catch as can?
- Shoes or barefoot?
- Makes no never mind to me.
- Barefoot.
Ya-ha!
Go on, Leroy, go on!
You'II get kiIIed
just to give something away.
Ain't got no choice.
Get that city boy!
Get the city boy!
- Let's go.
- Make him say ''caIf rope'', Leroy.
Come on, Leroy. Get him, Leroy.
Get him!
You stop that! You make him fight fair!
Look out for that rake!
Watch out!
Let's go in the car!
Yee-ha! Ya-hoo! Whoo!
- Are you pushing?
- Of course I'm pushing!
OK, it'II go now.
Put your foot on the brake.
- The brake!
- It don't work!
The brake, goddamn it, the brake!
- Don't you know where the brake is?
- It don't work.
Oh! WeII, it figures.
WeII, we're in Missouri.
What'II we do now?
Drop some twenties?
- How much money we got?
- $837 and some change.
We're just outside St Jo.
- So what?
- So...
It's a big town.
We can do better than twenties.
Moze, what if he don't beIieve you?
He wiII. He's out to make a kiIIing,
just Iike us.
- Maybe he don't have a siIver mine?
- I checked. Where's the money?
He's just what peopIe say he is.
Rich and greedy.
PuII up your socks.
We couId get a house and everything.
Everything, just everything.
Just around the corner
There's a rainbow in the sky...
Got it? Corner of East Waring
and BurIington, 1 1 .00.
Just show up with tears in your eyes.
Don't forget the money.
Of course I won't.
See you in 30 minutes.
Moze, couId we get a piano?
A piano? We'II have a whoIe factory.
Just around the corner
There's a rainbow in the sky
I guess you just didn't make
a good enough swap.
My brother's reaI sore at you.
Seems you soId him his own whiskey.
You can't arrest me here.
Your brother's a bootIegger!
You got an awfuI big mouth, mister.
Maybe I can't arrest you in Missouri.
Maybe I don't want to.
But I can make sure you ain't going
to feeI good whiIe you're here.
Let's go!
Addie!
Addie.
Moze!
Moze.
- I...I swaIIowed my goId tooth.
- Oh, Moze...
- They took it aII.
- You're aII beat up.
Nothing's Ieft.
I've been keeping $1 0 for emergencies!
What'II we do with $1 0?
Buy BibIes. Do a IittIe widow business.
Must be Iots of good towns around here.
Do twenties, drop some waIIets.
Before you know it, we'II be good again.
I'II bet in no time, we couId have
a whoIe new car and everything.
You're taking me
to Aunt BiIIie's now, ain't you?
I won't.
- Don't cry.
- I won't.
It's where we set out for, ain't it?
Looks nice.
Yeah, Iooks reaI fine.
- That must be your uncIe.
- He Iooks nice, too.
Yep, reaI nice.
Maybe if RooseveIt comes by,
they'II take me to see him.
- If you write him, he can write back now.
- He might at that.
Course he wiII.
Ain't no question but he wiII.
AII this taIk's just wasting time.
There's your skates and your radio.
- Where wiII you go?
- I got pIans.
New ideas coming in every day.
Get going.
If I knew for sure you wasn't my pa...
It's for sure I ain't.
Sometimes I used to figure
Mr Connors couId have been my pa.
The way he touched my shouIder. Get
me things from the candy counter free.
And Mr Pritchard,
he smiIed at me once, reaI nice.
Except they don't have my jaw
or nothing.
So Iong.
Ain't you coming to the door with me?
