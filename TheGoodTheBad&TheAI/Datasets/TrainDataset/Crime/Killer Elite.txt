HUNTER: Hey, kiddo,
what are you doing?
I buy you a fancy
Mexican meal and you're
feeding it to a mutt.
Real fancy.
You have any idea
what that is?
What?
Tree chicken.
What?
That's what
the locals call it.
Colds, headaches, hangovers,
cures anything.
Iguana.
That's what they say.
What about indigestion?
Fuckin' iguana taco.
Yeah, well,
you had it in Salvador.
Yeah, and that was shit.
What about Angola?
The food was
good there, right?
Shit.
Yeah, Rhodesia?
Shit.
Hamburg?
Shit.
So if it's not New York,
it's...
You got it. Shit.
Look at you
wasting away.
We got to get a job
in New York.
That won't be a problem.
Plenty of assholes there.
Time to move, kiddo.
MEIER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oops.
Fuck!
Stay down!
HUNTER: Stay down, kid.
What happened?
There was a kid in the car.
What?
There was a kid in the car.
Go, go, go, go!
Fuck!
I'm done with this.
I'm finished.
I can't do this anymore.
I can't do this.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
AGENT: Danny, get in.
These camel jockeys
have got diseases
I don't wanna think about.
Where is he?
The client still has him.
What client?
We're going there now.
Okay, drive.
AGENT: So the client's
an oil sheikh, no less.
He used to rule some huge
stretch of desert till
his tribe kicked him out.
Been living here
in exile ever since.
Anyway, Sheikhy was loaded
and he wanted a job done.
Hunter took the contract,
then he ran.
They caught him
at the airport.
And?
You know the rest.
You got the package.
Yeah, I got it.
What's the job?
Just came with a price tag,
no details.
Hunter took it cold.
Why would he do that?
Six million dollars.
A big score, Danny.
Too bloody big
for Hunter.
Yeah.
Why'd you
offer it to him?
He wanted the money.
And you were out, remember?
Yeah. Still am.
I'm done with killing.
Yeah, well, maybe
killing ain't done with you.
Hunter needs the old Danny,
the best in the biz.
The one with balls of steel.
You remember him, right?
Look, it comes
down to this.
You don't do this job,
Hunter's a dead man.
They're waiting for you.
This way.
SHEIKH AMR: He's waiting
for his eyes to adjust.
Be careful
around this one, boy.
My son forgets
the ways of the desert.
Since our war against
the Sultan, all he has
had of his homeland
is this paint. Plaster.
My first son, Hussain,
was slaughtered here.
Shot before his children.
And here,
at the Battle of Mirbat,
his brother, Salim, was
wounded and then killed.
Murdered.
And then my third son
was taken from me. Ali.
Hunted down
and slaughtered.
The law of the desert
says the blood of the victim
must be washed away
by the blood of the killers.
But I refused revenge
and saved my last son,
Bakhait, from the war.
So I was exiled
to this desert.
I have wealth, power.
But rich men die, too.
When I die, I want Bakhait
to go home to my tribe.
But for that to happen,
the killers of my sons
must be killed.
You don't need me
or Hunter for this.
You got all the men
you need.
What use would my
men be in England?
England?
The English sent their
fiercest dogs to kill
for the Sultan's oil.
The SAS?
Yes.
Their glorious
special forces.
It was a war.
It was not England's war.
They came to my land,
murdered my sons,
now they will face my law.
The doctors say I have
six months left to live.
You must avenge my sons
before I die
or your friend
will die with me.
I don't care how
you kill the killers.
But they will admit
their guilt on tape,
and their deaths must
look like accidents.
This must not
lead back to my son.
So go, show the English
a war isn't over till
both sides say it is.
I wanna see Hunter.
Oh, Danny!
No, Danny.
No, no, no, no. No.
What are you doing here?
Get out of here.
You all right?
Am I all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
You gotta go.
Get away from here.
Go, go, go, go.
I'm not here
for you anyway.
I was thinking about
the girls and Celine.
Me, too. Me, too.
What's that
supposed to mean?
It's tough putting
food on the table.
What you feeding 'em?
Six million, no questions?
Well.
So you must've known
that was a bullshit job.
Yeah, I knew.
Fuckin' SAS,
a one-way ticket for sure.
Well, you took the job,
and I'm not leaving you here.
Hey!
Give this man a drink.
I missed you.
I didn't miss you.
Every day you
were out of this game
was a good day for me.
I was proud of you
when you got out.
Stay out.
Too late.
You should have stayed away.
Or run faster.
Son of a bitch!
What are you doing?
Let me get my watch back.
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go, get the door!
Get the door!
Give me the gun.
Bravo! Bravo!
If you need to be shot,
I'll happily oblige.
I'm sorry, kiddo.
My father
needs him alive.
Nice try. You know
they'd have found you.
Everybody gets found.
You knew.
My gut tells me you knew
the target and you knew
Hunter wouldn't take it.
You used him as bait.
That's a lot of
angles, Danny.
Do you think
I'm that smart?
Get out. And you. Out.
ANNE: We missed you
at the dance last night.
DANNY: I'm not much
of a dancer.
Besides,
I'm still trying to find out
how much house is under this.
Right, big plans.
Yeah, maybe too big.
You don't remember me,
do you?
Yeah, well,
it's been a while.
I'm Anne Frazer.
Anne Frazer?
Anne had red hair
full of grass.
Yeah.
And weird
red gumboots.
With eyes on them.
Oh, my God!
Oi! You owe me 50 quid.
Told you he'd be back,
didn't I?
We missed you.
Yeah?
Here I am.
DAVIES: All right,
then, you want some?
Yeah, mate,
you still got it.
Still got that edge.
You're a real killer.
DANNY: Come on,
let's talk.
DAVIES: While you were away,
you didn't start a family,
did you?
No.
So no one's
depending on you?
Only Hunter.
'Cause one, you're
going after the SAS.
They're a paranoid bunch.
They always got their
back up.
Two, you need info on Oman.
No one talks about Oman.
They went in there as advisors
and ended up fighting the
fucking war. Real hush-hush,
semi-mercenary stuff.
Three,
you need confessions.
They're trained
to resist torture
so no matter
what you say or do,
they'll say nothing.
And four, Danny,
this is the best
special forces regiment
in the world.
They make the Navy Seals
look like a bunch of
cupcakes.
And not only that,
you're trying to take down
three of their geezers
and make it look
like an accident.
All I'm asking is
give it some thought.
Take a day,
more if you want.
I'm going anyway.
Of course I'm in,
you silly bastard.
It's what we do, right?
Anyway, I've got
a score to settle
with them.
Tried out for them
when I was in the Paras.
Did Hereford,
the whole fucking lot.
MEIER: What,
and they wouldn't have you?
You want this bottle
shoved up your arse?
Are you upset?
Would you like a lolly?
I'd love a lolly.
MEIER:
Strawberry or fuck you?
Meier.
In.
Why?
Ah, six million reasons.
So what's the split?
After the Agent
takes his slice,
I'm in this
for Hunter.
How wonderfully touching.
Touching,
but fuckin' stupid.
The Sheikh could only ID
one of the killers.
I need you to come
up with the names
on the other two.
Start with the one
they killed at Mirbat.
So the one target we do have
is Steven Douglas Harris.
Stayed on in Oman
after the war.
Ended up flying choppers
for the Sultan's armed forces.
Great. A juice junkie.
Me and Meier'll head there
to track him down.
Boys? Danny. Meier.
MAN: What the fuck!
MAN: Harris!
Harris, you prick!
Fuck off!
Well, I hope
the buggers like sand
in their burgers, huh?
White Range Rover
coming your way.
It's Harris.
SANDY:
What are you doing?
Come on, have a go.
No.
Come on.
I'm not.
Have a go. Look.
Just aim and shoot.
Go! Here we go!
Oh, you horny git!
Come on.
No.
Come on.
Come on.
DAVIES: All right, ladies,
you can throw your knickers
if you want.
Go on,
you cheeky bugger!
MAN: You serve in Oman?
At Mirbat.
That was a day,
wasn't it?
What about Mirbat?
That was a right mess, eh?
Wasn't good.
I had a mate there.
DIANE: Spike, get that quick.
Yeah, all right, all right.
Bollocks.
Hello?
Spikey, it's Bazza.
God's sake! I'm unplugging
that bloody thing next time,
and I mean it.
Yeah, I'm onto this
bloke here, right.
He was in the Bear earlier
pumping some SAS lads
for info on Mirbat.
Mirbat. And?
He says he's Welsh.
But he don't sound it.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm being
a bit paranoid, but...
Hey, just 'cause
you're being paranoid,
doesn't mean to say
they're not out to get you.
All right, mate,
give me what you've got.
Okay.
Put one of my
Locals onto him.
SPIKE: The Omani Embassy.
Our Local followed him
into the visa section.
Says he's Welsh,
calls himself Mr. Jones.
We lost him
after he left.
FITZ: Lost him?
How come?
He never came back
to his car. Stolen.
Anyhow, he flies to Oman
in four days.
I'd like permission
to send one of my boys
out there to tail him.
This was definitely
some kind of recce.
That was a dirty war.
What we did there
was questionable.
Oman is
a bloody hornet's nest.
Right. And if this bugger
is poking at it,
I want to know who he is.
I say we send a Local.
Any objections?
Noted. We'll leave you
to choose the right man.
I'd also like it noted
that we are ex-SAS.
The men we protect
are ex-SAS.
And you, Spike,
though you hate to
admit it, are ex-SAS.
JUSTICE: Remember,
we're businessmen
and bankers now.
What we do here is illegal.
We can leave no trace
of our activities.
That's why we're called
The Feather Men,
'cause our touch is light.
THE DON:
Now, Spike's a good man.
Day the SAS lost him,
they lost a good soldier.
COMMANDER B: Yes, but
the problem is he thinks
he's still in the SAS.
Well, someone has to do
the dirty work.
None of us want blood
on our pinstripes.
Listen, I've got
no problem with blood.
What worries me is ink.
Make sure he keeps us
out of the newspapers.
MARTIN:
What's doing, boss?
Your Arabic's
still good, right?
Good enough.
You're going to Oman.
I've got a bloke I want you
to tail out there.
You lucky bastard!
You know what?
You're gorgeous.
Where are you staying?
I'm staying
at the Hilton.
As a matter of fact, so am I.
What room are you in?
Why? Would you
like to know?
Love to.
AIR HOSTESS:
You are smooth.
DAVIES: What are we
doing out here, then,
in the middle of nowhere?
MEIER: Well, I ask him
to go hide it, he hides it.
Could've been your asshole,
consider yourself lucky.
Shut it, Meier.
Appreciate it, thank you.
These tiles are
an exact match
to the shower step?
Hundred percent.
Harris comes home,
parks the car.
It's been a hard day.
I'll have a shower.
Whoops.
He slips on the shampoo,
hits the corner of the step
with his occiput.
Case closed.
Get out of it.
You boys are going
about this all wrong.
That bird he's screwing
is married.
Why don't we just pop 'em
both and make it look like
her husband did it.
Pop 'em both?
What's she ever done?
It's Harris we're after.
Poor bastard.
Ten years after the war,
he cops it for doing something
he was ordered to do.
He knew what he was doing
when he joined the club.
Yeah, what club?
The killing club.
It could be you or me.
Yeah, but it's not...
I'm just glad
I never killed a raghead.
No offense, my son.
Let's get this done.
MEIER: Excuse my friend.
He's a royal asshole.
Shit!
DAVIES: Where's he gonna run?
It's the middle of
the fuckin' desert.
Son of a...
Meier,
cut him off at the next shaft!
Let's go, let's go.
Where is he?
Shh.
DAVIES: Let's get out here.
Fuckin' hell!
MEIER: So what, now
somebody's on our ass?
DANNY: We should move
right away.
We'll set up Harris'
interview for tomorrow.
Davies, you make sure
his girl doesn't show.
She has nothing
to do with this.
Wanker!
DANNY: We're military
historians. I'll do
the talking, all right?
Well, it's 5:00 somewhere,
isn't it?
So where's this documentary
gonna be shown, then?
On the telly?
The chair.
Those bastards in C Company
put this together. Hmm?
HARRIS: What's the matter?
They didn't like sand
in their burgers?
Eh?
Hello, boys.
I'm not saying a word
till I see my lawyer.
Think back.
The village of Qum.
You killed
a guerilla commander.
His name was Hussain bin Amr.
Do you admit it?
Fuck off!
You're kidding, right?
You commanded
a company there.
Yeah, I led a company
on that op, sure.
And you assassinated
Hussain bin Amr.
There were witnesses.
You dropped him
in front of his family.
All right, you got me.
I did it. Hmm?
Fuck you! Good one.
Now untie me.
Get up.
Hey! Piss off!
We have what we need.
What if I told you
somebody else dropped
your guerilla commander?
His name is...
I can't remember.
But he's writing a book
about the whole Oman gig.
You might
find it in there.
If you could read.
To the bathroom.
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
It's coming back to me,
looking at your fucking face.
His name is
Captain R. Sole!
A-R-S-E H-O-L-E.
Shut up.
You're fucking dead, yeah?
On your knees.
Fucking queers!
Serves you fucking right!
Head down.
Get your fuckin'
hands off me, you queer!
You're fuckin' kidding me.
DANNY: Hold him still.
If I find you,
I'll put your fuckin' head
in the toilet bowl.
Poor fucker.
Jay!
I need money for the taxi.
I had to take a taxi.
I had a flat.
HARRIS:
Fuck you!
Case closed.
Thank you.
WOMAN OVER RADIO: Tells of
a dramatic 12-hour
rescue operation
to save the crew
of Radio Caroline.
The pirate radio
ship sank the...
It seems your friend
did what you couldn't.
Wouldn't.
Wouldn't, couldn't.
He's avenged Hussain.
Good news for the old man,
not for you.
What do you mean?
Three brothers dead.
Rotting in the sand.
You didn't wanna get
revenge yourself?
Scared of getting
your hands dirty?
Better get used to it.
No palace where you're going.
A tent and a hole to shit in.
He's your worst nightmare
and he's gonna do it.
And when he does,
you're out of here.
When I find you
in that desert,
I pray God keeps my aim...
...true.
Well, what do you think?
Yeah, it's coming along.
What are you doing
for New Year's Eve dinner?
Oh, shit!
DANNY: Bollocks!
Strangers are a bit
of an exotic thing
around here.
Oh, come on, I didn't
think I was a stranger.
I know,
but you're still exotic.
Danny, something tells me
you've got a story to tell.
Yeah.
Mmm.
Come on,
what are you waiting for?
Party's outside.
MAN: Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
It's a tradition
around here.
Happy New Year!
Shit!
Mirbat. The artist's
name is on the back.
Have them talk to him.
One more thing.
My boys had some
trouble in Oman.
Somebody was
tailing them.
We'll have to have
a look into that,
won't we?
Yeah.
Ah, that's how you
get it so lifelike, then.
Sorry?
Photos of the lads.
Isn't that like cheating?
I'm recreating
an historical event.
Accuracy is everything.
Mmm.
That Mirbat painting
stopped me cold
when I saw it.
You were at Mirbat?
Had a mate there.
I was hoping
you might have
an address for him.
You're with the SAS?
Was.
Then your best bet
for an address would be
Regimental Association...
They won't talk to me.
Spent the last few years
plying my trade overseas.
Angola and that.
I come to you
unofficial like.
Ah.
Well, I might have
something somewhere.
Just give me
a few minutes.
Be my guest.
I got a bullshitter
askin' about Mirbat.
Yeah. He claims
he's with the regiment.
No, there's no way
he was SAS.
Yeah, I can smell it off him.
Ah, he's a bloody fake.
My contact says
the call was cut off,
but Gowling said that
there was somebody there
asking about Mirbat.
It has to be our guy.
And what would you
have us do about it?
Find him.
If we don't, there's gonna be
another murder and it will be
one of our Mirbat boys.
Then who are they?
Well, they're pros
for sure.
If these guys are
going after the SAS,
they're gonna be top-class
professional assassins.
They must have a string
of hits behind them
but they're completely
under the radar.
All we've got is Oman.
Oman?
We all know
our people went too far.
Oman, Mirbat.
It all needs
to be left alone.
You should try telling
that to the Welshman.
He's right.
We have to find
this phony Welshman
and his group.
DAVIES: The file says
an SAS officer
killed the Sheikh's son
at the Battle of Mirbat.
Warrick Steven Cregg.
He was the only officer
there that night.
Killed everything that moved.
He's our worst nightmare.
A real hotshot.
Paintings of him, the lot.
Where did you get this?
The bloke
who did the paintings.
Don't you worry
about that, all right?
He's shuffled off
this mortal coil.
That wasn't
part of the deal.
Come on, shit happens
when you play in the deep end
of the pool, Danny.
Why couldn't you two
stick to the plan, huh?
You've been
watching this Cregg,
what's your next big idea?
His wife's in hospital.
When he's not training
for the selection march,
he spends
most days there.
MEIER: So why don't we
hit him there?
DANNY: No.
Not near his family.
Get me everything
you know on that march.
We'll see
where that goes.
Okay, so,
there's only four
Mirbat survivors
in Britain.
I've got Locals
on the other three.
You get the celebrity.
Warrick Cregg?
You're kidding.
Wish I was.
DAVIES: Welcome to hell,
the SAS selection march.
Forty-one miles,
fifty-five pounds of gear.
They lose someone
every couple of years.
Don't you even
think about it.
Why not?
During the march
this place is
crawling with SAS.
Yeah, you said it yourself.
It's an accident
waiting to happen.
How are you gonna
catch him then?
He's been
training for months,
he's like a greyhound.
We'll just have to
slow him down, won't we?
Insulin. Chlorpropamide.
Initial here.
Anything doing?
No, Cregg's still in there
with his missus.
Here, boss, this
will keep you going.
Cheers.
Pennock. I need you
back here, mate. Pronto.
Get out of
the fucking way!
WOMAN: Maniac!
You wouldn't fucking
believe it, somebody
was watching Cregg.
What?
Mmm.
You think he's
from the same stable as
the shooter in the desert?
Maybe. He was good.
Whoever he is,
he's too late.
Ah, good, good.
Chroma slows him down.
Insulin
sends him into shock.
Hypothermia to you.
And when were you
planning on
getting it to him?
Before the march.
How?
It's an SAS base, Danny.
That you trained in.
So think back.
The security layout,
the lot.
You're nuts.
Are you gonna do it?
Man, you really
are one crazy
son of a bitch, Danny.
Clock's ticking.
You've got under a minute,
all right?
We've got company.
Lovely night.
You can't
stop here, mate.
I didn't stop,
the truck did.
If you don't fucking move it,
we will.
All right, all right.
But it's pissing oil, mate.
There's nothing
I can do about it.
Turn off
the bloody radio.
MAN: Where's your gear?
Right. On the trucks!
SERGEANT 1: I don't care
what regiment you're from.
I don't care how great
you think you are.
Let's see what
you're made of, ladies.
On the trucks.
SERGEANT 2: Come on!
Get moving, you lot.
He only got
half the dose.
Is it enough?
MEIER: Enough?
He's a dead man walking.
Stay on him, okay?
DANNY: His name was
Salim bin Amr.
Do you remember the name?
Did you kill him?
Think back.
Did you kill him, Major?
CREGG: Yeah, I did.
I did the bastard.
So bloody what?
Danny didn't want
to do this.
DANNY: You did?
And your boy
doesn't want to go back
to the desert.
TV BROADCASTER:
The Ministry of Defence
today announced the death
of an army officer
during maneuvers.
Thirty-three-year-old,
Major Warrick Steven Cregg,
died of exposure
during an SAS exercise
on the Brecon Beacons.
Weather conditions at the time
were described as appalling,
with...
Hey! Hey!
Show a bit of
respect, lads.
Top that.
I come bearing gifts.
Oi!
AGENT: From my boys
in Angola.
I have no idea
how you're meant
to eat this.
So.
So.
Who's on our ass?
I'm on it.
Don't worry.
Look, there's only
one more to go.
After this is done,
I'll get you boys a nice,
cushy job in the sun.
Hmm?
There is no "after this."
I'm a vulture.
I live off killers.
It gives me
a unique perspective.
Have you heard of
the two percent?
That's you.
Davies, the SAS,
all you lot.
Mercenaries, hit men, heroes.
You're all part of
that two percent of men
who are natural killers.
That's why
you'll never get out.
You can't run away
from who you are, Danny.
That's not who I am,
that's what I've done.
And I can do
something else.
Yeah, yeah.
That's all nice and good.
But let's just take care
of business first, shall we?
Your third target,
Major Simon McCann,
Mad Simon McCann of late.
How'd you find him?
Asked around.
It was easy.
These days, he's your basic
"cash for trash" mercenary.
He's a sitting duck.
Now didn't I tell you
I came bearing gifts?
You know
where to find me.
DAVIES: You don't trust
that snake, do you?
He's lying.
Yeah? How do you know?
His lips were moving.
He just gave us
a third target.
You've done nothing
on that last file.
Someone's onto us.
I want Hunter
out of there.
I want this finished.
And I want
to be around to enjoy
the money when it is.
The first thing
you should buy
is a pair of balls.
We're going after McCann,
all right?
ANNE: I miss you.
There's a lot
I don't know about you,
but I do know that much.
I convince myself
that everything's okay
because when I'm
with you I'm happy.
But then you go away
and I realize that I
know nothing about you.
I don't know where you go
and I don't know
what you do, I mean,
you've got a whole
nother life, Danny.
Is there someone else?
Come on, Anne.
Well, then,
what is it?
I mean, Jesus,
what are you not telling me?
What are you hiding?
Can we talk about this
when I get back?
To hell with it.
Fuck.
What?
You show me
a beautiful woman,
I'll show you a bloke
that's sick of her shit.
Shut up.
Roger that.
DANNY: That him?
DAVIES: That's him.
Major Simon McCann.
Served in the Sultan's forces
till he was pensioned out
four years ago.
And another.
Oi!
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?
Piss off, grandpa.
You want some?
Oh!
DANNY: Doesn't look
like an invalid.
Like I said, a bomb
went off under his jeep,
scrambled his wiring.
He can't keep a job.
He's a fucking psycho.
Jesus.
Come on, mate,
that's enough.
What's he doing here?
That's the one
I went head-to-head
with at the hospital.
Right.
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's go.
Stick with him.
Mac, it's me. You okay?
McCANN: Oh, yeah,
still scraping skinheads
off my doorstep.
All right, mate.
I was just checking in.
Bloke who drives
that green Jag,
what's his name?
AGENT:
His name's Spike Logan.
He's an ex-soldier
of some kind.
He got his eye shot out
playing a hero somewhere.
He's got no job
and he keeps odd hours.
Hmm.
Don't you know
who these guys are?
I mean, secrets being
your bread and butter.
Don't worry about it.
I do worry about it.
You should, too.
Every move my guys make,
these lot are waiting.
You ask me,
I think it's time
you put those fancy shoes
of yours on a few throats.
Yes. But no one
is asking you.
DAVIES: You'll be interviewing
for a security position,
Mr. McCann.
McCANN: Right.
Actually we got your name
from a mutual friend
in the SAS.
Yeah, really?
So, we'll see you
Tuesday the 17th,
at 10:00.
Okay.
We look forward to it.
See you then.
All right, my son.
He'll be there.
Good.
I don't get it.
McCann lives here.
He'll be here
for the interview,
Tuesday at 10:00.
He'll take this road.
The Boston Brakes.
Perfect.
They weren't perfect
in Boston.
I wasn't at the controls.
We've got 10 days.
MEIER: Ten days?
The quicker we get
this done, the better.
I'm going to need
to bring in some help.
Okay.
DAVIES: "Okay."
Just like that?
McCann's being watched.
How are you gonna
get a confession
out of him?
We aren't.
We'll fake it.
Bit of bad lighting
and camera work,
you could be him.
What we'll do is
play back what he
admitted to in the reports.
Who are you?
I'm the one they let fly
around in an unmarked chopper
with a gun in my pocket.
You can call me MFWIC.
"MFWIC"?
Mother Fucker
What's In Charge.
We have questions.
About this little
illegal club of yours,
The Feather Men.
Your attack dog,
time to bring him
to heel, eh?
And then we'll put that
on the agenda.
Gentlemen.
We'll be with you
in a minute.
I want to put Locals
on Major McCann
around the clock.
I realize McCann
is an old friend of yours,
but what has it to do with us?
But this is our chance
to get the bastards
who killed Cregg and Harris.
The authorities found
no evidence of foul play
in either case.
What are you talking about,
"No evidence?"
I've got the evidence
right here.
Everybody in this room knows
that those men were killed.
Everybody knows that McCann
is going to be next.
That's enough, Spike.
We have to do something.
THE DON: Well, we could
put it to the vote.
Yes, but that would require
the full committee.
And it will have to wait.
Spike.
That was a set-up.
He sent him away.
He knew there'd be a vote.
Spike, please.
Look, listen.
This is getting big.
The powers that be
are asking questions.
Pressure's being applied.
They have their
reputations to protect.
I'm not doing this
to protect reputations.
You know,
a light touch
is one thing,
but no touch at all?
I can't do this.
You realize this thing
is set up for maximum
deniability?
You're the only one
who knows the Locals.
All their orders
come through you.
So?
So? If this comes out,
you're the one
who takes the fall.
Fall? From where?
I am done with this
whole committee thing.
I'm gonna find him.
MEIER: He's a good kid,
don't worry.
I'm shtupping his mom.
DAVIES: Does he know
he can't bring his mom
on the job?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
DAVIES: Tell your mates
in Oman I said hello.
Danny,
is this what it was like
when you were first starting?
This is your first job?
Jesus.
My first time,
I puked for a day
afterwards.
I was young and dumb,
just the way the army
likes them.
I could be good
at this, man.
I mean, it's easy, yeah?
Killing's easy.
Living with it
is the hard part.
PORTER: If I see him,
I'll give you a bell.
Don't be shy about
spreading the word.
There's a very
tidy finder's fee.
I'll keep my eyes peeled.
One more and we'll
call it a night.
JAKE: We're on.
MEIER: He's late.
Just keep me at 75 feet
and give me
a clear line of sight.
Yeah, okay.
Where'd you buy
your license?
On his tail.
Doing 60.
You'll have a visual
on Danny in one minute.
Stay with him, Jake.
I got him.
DAVIES:
We have target in sight.
JAKE: Gonna miss it.
Come on, get in.
Get in behind him!
Just do it, get in!
There's not enough room!
Push him!
I can't get in there.
Okay, then overtake him. Go!
Pass him!
DAVIES: What the hell
are you doing, Meier?
MEIER: I need
a range countdown.
Meier,
don't screw this up.
I'll operate
looking backwards.
Relax, Meier.
Davies will give you
the countdown.
DAVIES: 400 meters.
MEIER: Okay, range me.
Outside lane, Meier.
Here he comes.
Now, now. Now, Meier!
Shut up!
Now, Meier!
Fishtail! Fishtail!
Oh! Oh!
JAKE: You fucking got him!
You got him, man.
MEIER:
Oh, fuck, he's dead.
He's dead as Elvis.
You got him, man!
Stop the car.
We gotta be sure Elvis
has left the building.
DAVIES:
Target had a minder.
Head to the exit point.
Bring him to me.
He had a fucking minder.
Fuck! You got him, man.
You got him!
Shut up! Drive!
Go! Go! Go!
Who is he?
I don't know.
Give me an update, Davies.
Oh, man,
he's coming fast!
Up here there's a yard.
Take a left.
Shit!
Up here to the left.
Keep going.
Hold on.
Come in, Davies.
Davies,
where the fuck are you?
Got you, you bastards.
MEIER: Fuck this!
Go! Go!
JAKE: Here he comes!
Here he comes!
Get out of the car!
Where the fuck
do you guys come from?
Step away from the car.
Easy.
Jake.
Yeah?
Take it easy.
Check the car.
Slowly.
No, no, no, no!
No!
He had no ID.
Nothing.
Not a fucking thing.
Who the fuck is he?
This shouldn't
have happened.
This should not have
fucking happened!
Take it easy, Danny.
Danny...
Take it easy?
We were out of there.
Clean. Done.
PENNOCK:
Look, I'm getting nothing.
Campbell's not picking up.
Is there anything
at your end?
Fuck.
Who are these bastards?
I don't know. But they're
looking for their man
and they're not legit.
Jake, call this number.
Tell the Agent we need
a cleanup crew here ASAP.
And wire that radio
into my car.
Gimme here.
That's it then.
Yeah.
Done.
I fly tonight.
You should get going, too.
They're close.
What happens
to Meier's cut?
There has to be somebody.
Poor sod.
I'll have a hooker for him.
He'd like that.
Yeah.
Be safe.
You too, Davies.
PENNOCK: Sorry.
We're still looking for
Campbell, but it looks bad.
Thank you, sir.
If there's anything else...
Room service.
Something exotic.
Yeah?
PORTER:
I found your Welshman.
You sure it's him?
I'm sure.
Fucking hell!
Get up. Get dressed. Move!
Look...
Get up!
Don't say a word to anyone.
Do you understand?
You killed Simon McCann,
didn't you?
Yeah? And Campbell.
Where is he,
you fucker?
Never heard of him.
That all you got?
Yeah, Spike?
We got the Welshman.
We're bringing him
to you now. Over.
SPIKE: Nice work, Pennock.
Well done.
I'm looking forward
to meeting the bastard.
Hey, Spike's gonna cut
your dick off and shove it
in your mouth. You like that?
I like the sound
of that, yeah.
Do you?
Yeah, I do.
Get in the van.
Get in.
Come on, get in!
Fuck me.
You're kidding.
Come on. Get in!
There you are, you prick.
Oi!
Open up.
Boss.
What am I meant
to do with that?
He had this on him.
A phone number.
Great work.
That pile of mincemeat was
our best chance of finding out
who these bastards are.
Print him and trace
that bloody number.
You fucking idiots!
DANNY: Drop it.
Left hand.
Put the gun on the floor.
Kick it to me.
The Welshman,
they were bringing him
to you. Where is he?
He didn't make it.
You? You do it?
A truck.
He made a break for it.
He got lucky.
Would have been
very slow otherwise.
Yeah, well that was
my fucking friend.
Yeah, and McCann was mine.
And what about fucking...
Campbell?
No.
Davies. Meier. Harris.
McCann. Cregg. Campbell.
Too many names
on that list.
Don't go
adding yours, Spike.
Inside.
Who are you?
Doesn't matter.
After tonight,
I don't exist.
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?
It's over.
Done.
You think so?
No uniform,
no war, not special.
You don't know what
to do with yourself.
Nobody knows
what to do with you.
Right?
Wrong.
You know my name
but you don't know me.
You have no idea
who you're fucking with.
Really?
Don't follow me.
Don't put your name
on that list.
The third confession.
SHEIKH AMR:
The killers
have been killed,
now you can go home.
BAKHAIT:
You can have your man.
You will get the money
when it's been checked.
Bring him out.
Bring him out!
Let me put...
I just wanna
put my watch on.
What's the matter with you?
You all right?
Yeah.
What's the plan?
Get out of here.
Okay, sounds good.
I was sure
you were gonna get
yourself killed, kiddo.
How in the hell
did you do it?
How'd you pull it off?
I don't want to
talk about it.
I get it.
Thank you. Not from me,
but from my kids
for having a dad.
I could never
thank you enough
for what you did. Never.
Yeah, you can.
You can get out
of the business.
Be done with this shit.
No more soldiering.
No more mercenary work.
All right.
Okay, okay.
I'm asking you, please.
Tell me you're done.
I'm done. I'm out.
Good.
Stay out. Otherwise
all this is for nothing.
So, how are
the Yankees doing?
You could have called.
You wouldn't have answered.
No. Sorry about that.
You're sorry?
It's me
who should be sorry.
So it's over?
You going back again?
No.
And you're ready to
tell me everything?
Whatever you want to know.
Good.
Except I don't want to know.
Not anymore.
I've...
I've missed you, Danny.
I don't really
care about the past,
I just care about now.
Hey, boss.
All right, Cal?
That phone number?
That was a business.
It's for some shit
travel agent.
Runs mercenaries
in and out of every
shithole in the world.
Come in.
Hello?
AGENT: Hello, Danny.
How'd you
get this number?
Please, Danny,
don't insult my
professionalism.
What do you want?
We got a problem
with the job.
The job's done.
No.
You killed
the wrong guy.
There's one more to go.
I busted my nuts
setting this job up
and I want my 10%.
No, I did
what I had to do.
Tell that to the Sheikh.
He wants a London
meet with his son.
Check with your girlfriend
before you make
any rash decisions. Eh?
What are you doing?
Come to bed.
Come with me, Anne.
What?
To Paris.
You can wait for me there
while I'm in London.
Leave tomorrow.
Nothing's keeping
you here, right?
It's the middle
of the night.
Anne. Anne!
They know about you.
Who knows about me?
And about us.
When will this be over?
Soon.
If all goes well.
It will, won't it?
Danny.
Keep a good eye
on her, huh?
Listen, don't do this
on your own.
No other way.
Davies, Meier,
all this heat on you.
Come on, let's just get
in the car, we'll go to
London, be at the airport...
No. We have a deal,
remember?
What do you mean?
You think I can't cut this,
is that it?
I mean,
I'm not a babysitter,
come on!
I need to know
she's safe.
You're the only one
I trust.
This is bullshit.
You could run,
both of you just go, come on.
Everyone gets found.
You know that.
You're gonna get
yourself killed, kiddo.
Thanks for doing this.
You gotta be kidding me.
Welcome back
to London, sir.
Thank you, sir.
You tell the old man
he threatens her again,
I'll put it between his eyes.
Harris, the pilot,
on his film he said another
soldier killed my brother.
He was winding us up.
He thought it was
some kind of a joke!
This was just published.
The author served
with the SAS.
He describes an ambush
where he killed
a guerilla leader.
Harris did not
kill Hussain.
You gave me his name.
You said he was guilty.
Such is Allah's will.
Allah's will?
You had me kill
an innocent man.
The book will be
the real killer's
confession.
My father...
I know what
your father needs.
I need everything
you can get
on a Ranulph Fiennes.
Yeah, writer, ex-SAS.
What you got?
I got Fiennes.
He's still pushing
his book on Oman.
He'll be doing
a press bash on Tuesday.
Tuesday.
I know it's a bit
short notice,
but I'll be able to
put a crew together.
Nah.
I'll do this on my own.
Danny, are you sure?
It's just a phone call.
I guess he's sure.
B-I-N-G fucking O.
I knew I'd find you,
you bastard.
Do you mind
if I sit down?
You look lonely.
You're Danny's friend.
The famous Hunter.
He say nice things?
What are you doing here?
Watching you.
You should be with him.
I tried.
It didn't work.
He wanted me here
to protect you.
And you look like
you needed protecting.
From what?
You.
You're thinking about
him not coming back.
What happens then?
No, I...
I have a wife,
I know the look.
We've known each other
through thick and thin,
Danny and I.
Celine, my wife,
she loves him,
my kids love him.
I mean,
wild animals like Danny.
Yeah.
I know Danny's going
to come back for you.
And when he does,
you're going to
steal him away.
Huh?
I don't know
what the plan is.
I have a woman
to interrogate now.
PENNOCK: All right,
look alive, lads.
Boys.
So this guy is good.
Very good.
If he senses something's up,
he'll run until you corner
him and then he fights.
But now
the gloves are off.
This all fucking ends today.
MARTIN: All right,
everybody knows the rules.
MAN: There are no rules.
MAN: Boss, he's out front.
I think we're on.
This could be him.
Black leathers.
Roger that.
He just took
the service stairs.
It has to be him.
Just hold your positions.
We'll know soon enough.
He's down, boss.
We got him!
He stays alive.
Pennock, don't you touch him
until I'm there.
Stay here.
Stay there, you fucker.
Get his helmet off
before he chokes.
Shit.
Hands high,
against the wall.
Okay, easy with that.
Guys, our man's down.
Head for the roof.
Pennock, head for the roof.
We're on our way
up now, boss.
Come on, move!
He jumped!
He jumped!
PENNOCK: Come on, come on,
he's on the move. Let's go!
Aah!
SPIKE: Pennock?
Don't you do it.
PENNOCK: There's no sign
of him up here, boss.
I can see all the way
to the river.
He's gone.
Shit.
Move and you're dead.
Right, let's go, let's go.
Get in.
What is this?
PENNOCK:
That's for Campbell.
And that's for Cregg.
SPIKE: You finished?
We haven't even started.
Take the hood off.
Wait outside, boys.
Save a little bit
for us, boss.
So why is he still alive?
Why didn't you kill him?
Is that what you
would have done?
I thought you were
the good guys.
Who are you?
Who do you work for?
You and I got
a lot in common.
Really? You think so?
So, you're sitting there,
tied to a chair
and I'm standing here
with a gun in my hand.
Now you tell me
what the fuck
this was all about.
"Was?"
You think this is over?
There'll be
somebody else.
Your boy, Fiennes,
is gonna die.
Go on, pull the trigger.
Kill me and
you kill Fiennes.
They won't stop
till they get him.
I stopped you,
I'll stop them.
I didn't want to kill him.
They will.
You put that
in the right hands,
this thing's over.
The camera? Why?
Proof.
Evidence that he's dead.
It's the only way
you'll save him.
You tell me I'll walk,
I'll tell you who's behind
this and where to find him.
Okay.
You walk.
Sheikh Amr bin Issa.
You'll find him in Oman.
Why?
The war.
They killed
three of his sons.
No.
Some good guy, eh?
Drop it.
Inside.
Beside him.
On your knees.
You were set up.
That's what we
love about you lot.
You only care
about the action.
Never think
about what you might
really be fighting for.
Or who.
Never see the big picture.
You're the one
that was set up.
He just wouldn't
get out of the way.
Her Majesty's government
doesn't like secret societies.
Particularly when
they get in the way
of our interests.
Do you know how much oil
that pathetic crust of
desert is floating on?
Do you know what
those contracts
are worth?
Three men's lives.
That's right.
We deliver the killers.
Son Number 4 goes home
and when Sheikhy
re-ups the contracts,
we get
favorable consideration.
A bargain.
You bastard, you're a...
Patriot.
Who serves his country
as those three men did
with their deaths.
As you will with yours.
Fuck.
AGENT: There she is.
Danny might've
dropped off the radar,
but one thing's
for sure.
He'll come back for her.
He'll come through
that door with $6 million
and she won't be there.
Who don't you
screw out of his 10%?
Yours truly.
Boss.
Deal with him.
It wasn't personal.
Just business.
You played us.
I don't care why.
But if ever
a lying piece of shit
needed killing, it was you.
Game's over.
You know,
I wouldn't have hurt her.
I just wanted my cut.
She was only collateral.
If you go after them,
I'll find you.
Remember,
everybody gets found.
Even you.
HUNTER: You gotta
get those photos
to that old bastard
to finish this
thing for good,
you hear, kiddo?
That's why I'm here.
What about you?
Babysitting's over, kiddo.
Who says?
I say.
She's safe.
You're the one
taking the chances now.
Come on.
"Come on?"
You walked into
a trap last time.
You think I'm going to
let you do that again?
I told your girl
you were going to be
coming back to her.
You want to make
a liar out of me?
You know,
you were supposed
to be guarding her,
not interviewing her.
Well, I was always
a sucker for a pretty face,
no denying that.
She's a keeper,
that's for sure.
She doesn't know,
does she?
Some.
Yeah.
It's going to be tough.
My old man used to say,
"Life's like licking
honey from a thorn."
Yeah, what does that mean?
Something about good times
and bad times.
Seems like it's been
all thorns for us lately.
Both of us.
All right,
let's finish this.
I'll be top cover.
Anything goes wrong,
I'm coming in.
Hey, look,
the Sheikh wants this over.
It's in,
hand over the photos,
and out.
Yeah?
Yeah.
There isn't going
to be a problem.
From your mouth
to God's ears.
Don't move till I give
the all-clear, okay?
BAKHAIT: Who are you?
What do you want?
For the Sheikh.
I have to see it
placed in his hands.
Take these to my people.
Show them
what I have done.
I have a message
for the Sheikh.
He's still alive.
They're fakes.
But this is
going to end.
I don't care.
What'll I do
in that godforsaken desert?
Haven't you
forgotten something?
HUNTER: Hold it, hold it,
stay where you are.
Something's
not right here.
You seeing this?
Yeah, I see it.
So we're in
the wrong place.
HUNTER: Let's go! Let's go!
Relax, I only
killed the car.
You again!
Back at the palace,
what happened in there?
He was there, waiting
for a message from you.
I was the messenger.
And?
What do you think?
His boy in there
didn't give a shit.
He's not going back to
the desert, so there'll be
no oil contracts.
It was all for nothing.
Is that right?
And the winner is.
So that's what
this is all about.
Yeah, it's all hookers
and blow from here on in.
You just don't get it,
do you?
Ditch it.
You sure?
Ditch it.
I gotta cover
my expenses.
You can't go back
to England.
Not after killing
that spook.
Who the fuck are you?
Who, me?
The voice of experience.
Where are you going to go?
What are you going to do?
You're going to need this.
New name,
new face, new papers.
Expensive.
You'll see.
Damn shame.
You think you get
to just walk away?
Nobody walks away.
Not me or you,
none of us.
The old man
you just killed,
he told me a war isn't over
until both sides say it is.
Well, I'm telling you now,
this is over for me.
Really? And what? You want me
to say, "Me, too," and then
it's happy ever after?
Your choice.
You know, when I got this,
they told me my war was over.
I told them they
were full of shit.
Now I'm telling it to you.
Let it go.
So where are you going?
What, are you
planning a visit?
You never know.
You come.
I'll be waiting.
We'll call you a cab
from the airport.
Hey.
Aren't you Anne Frazer?
The girl with those
weird gumboots?
Are you Danny Bryce,
the boy who went away?
Yeah.
I'm back.
Where you headed?
I don't know.
Me, neither.
Want to come along?
