Jeff, I'm leaning toward an entry,
We know the boy's in his room, If we move now, we got a 100% chance of saving him,
- We're giving up on the mom?
- She's 20% at best,
Jeff, we gotta move on the boy,
It's the only choice,
- This one's getting away from him,
- Shrink-wrap, don't talk like I'm not here,
- We've been here for 16 hours,
- Fucking new guy,
Everybody calm down,
We're all tired,
I'd just steer Joe away from the subject of choice, Choosing represents...
Tell me something I don't fucking know,
Wait, wait,
- I hear crying,
- The boy's awake,
We've gotta keep the boy in his bedroom,
Hey, Joe, It's me, Jeff, I'm back on,
Listen, let Sean's mom take care of him, all right?
He's such a little shit, you know?
He's a little shit.
- Tell you what, Let me do you a favor,
- ... till that bitch feeds him.
Find out what Sean likes to eat, and I'll send it in,
Him and his mom can eat in the bedroom while me and you fix this thing,
- What do you say?
- Sean!
- The boy's moving from his bedroom,
-
Our guys put him at 80%,
Sean,
- Mr, Talley?
- Yes?
Are you gonna save us?
Yeah, Sean, I'm gonna save you,

He's still inside the house, along with his sister Jennifer,
I know you know the kind of young men they're dealing with,
I need that DVD, Mr, Smith,
You know what I'm talking about,

Tommy,

Shh, Keep your voice down, buddy,
Keep your voice down, Remember?
- Tommy, do you like to play video games?
- Yeah,
What kind of games do you play?
I like Monster Jam, I play Bounty Hunter, I play Wubba Zorg...
Wubba Zorg, I know Wubba Zorg,
I know that game,
That means you know who Agent Zero is, right?
What do you think Agent Zero would do right now?
Do you think he would say "never ever," Tommy?
No, he wouldn't say "never,"
Agent Zero would help Captain Wubba save Planet Xenon,
Are you like Captain...
Are you like Captain Wubba?
And Captain Wubba's  gonna save Planet Xenon,
Yeah, Tommy,
Captain Wubba's gonna save Planet Xenon,
Well, the most efficient entry point is here, The pool area,
Four-man team ropes in, Silent entry through one of the skylights here,
All right,
I put the doer and the two boys here in the courtyard, I keep the two kids in the house,
- How much time you need for the play?
- Two minutes,
Say you can get the hostages to the pool area,
How are you gonna get all three suspects to this side of the house?
Well, we're about to jump off that bridge,
aren't we?
Yeah?

Dennis?
Dennis?
What do you want?
You by yourself?
Yeah,
We got a problem, Dennis,
Oh, yeah?
Yeah,
Walter Smith just died,
Hear what I said?
Yeah,
I know Mars killed my cop, but Smith's death is on you, man,
Things just got a lot more complicated, didn't they, Dennis?
Not to mention the fact that helicopters are very expensive,
Gotta pay for the fuel, the pilot...
chief of police,
You know what cops do when they retire, Dennis?
They play golf,
I don't want to play golf, I hate fucking golf,
I want a house on the golf course,
I want that,
Walter Smith talked to me before he died,
I know about the money,
I don't know shit about money, man, I don't know shit about what you're talking about,
I'm talking about a transaction,
You want a helicopter, I want a house on the golf course,
Fifty thousand,
Maybe you can negotiate with the sheriffs for that,
No, No!
No,
Shit,
Half,
I'll give you half, OK?
That's, like... two million, OK?
Half is good,
All right, Sell it to your crew,
Jennifer and Tommy stay in the house,
The three of you down here in the courtyard,
I'll trade the helicopter for the cash,
How do I know the pilot's not gonna shoot me?
Let me worry about the pilot,
You just make sure he gets that bag, understand?
Yeah,
Half an hour,
font color="#aa5ff">
I'm getting us out, Kevin,
What do you think I'm doing?
You're just making it worse,
- Look, I always take care of you,
Bullshit,
That's the way it is, Kevin,
Always has been and always will be,
Always, OK?
What... What if they just want to get us outside just to shoot us?
They could have killed us, like, a million times, Kev,
But they didn't, because Talley wants to get paid,
Yeah, Get paid and then shoot us,
Wait, Leaving where?
We're going on a helicopter ride,
No, No, I don't want to,

What's this? This wasn't what we discussed,
This wasn't what we talked about,
Three people in the chopper,
That's all it can carry, Dennis,
I thought you were the man in charge,
Isn't that what you told me?
- You said, "I'm the man,"
- I am the man! I am in charge!
- Prove it,
- Mars, leave her!
Jenny and I aren't going nowhere,
Dennis, The man that owns this house is a criminal,
So are his friends,
This money belongs to them,
- You want more money?
- They'll come after you and fuckin' kill you,
You want more fucking money?
You just chose the wrong house on the wrong day,
- I'm not lying,
- Bullshit,
The only thing I lied to you about was Smith,
He's not dead, You didn't kill anybody,
That means that you and your brother can still beat the hard shit,
Just walk out of here with me,
Put those guns down and walk out now,
- Come on, don't let him fuck this up,
- Dennis, it's fucked,
They're gonna shoot us as soon as we get through the gate,
- You're lying to me!

So you gotta choose, Me or Mars,
I choose the money,
Oh, You choose the money,
You choose the money?
- What do you think of that?
- Done?
Chief Talley,
The situation has clearly gotten away from you,
Your flagrant disregard for protocol
has unnecessarily placed yourself and my officers in the line of fire,
My opinion? You remain in command, there's a probability of a negative outcome,
Jeff!
What are you doing?
-
You've just made it easier, Chief, You're done, You're finished,
Where's Chief Talley?
Laura Shoemaker, Sheriff's Department, I'm in command,
Are you Talley?
Walter Smith and his family are witnesses under federal protection,
Chief, the US government would like to thank you for your service and cooperation,
Chief, move, now,
Chief Talley is no longer in command here,
This is a federal matter now, ma'am,
Get in,

Come on, let me see how bad it is,
Kev,
God damn it, there are kids in that house,
Turn this into a smash-and-grab job and people are gonna get killed,

Shut up, Just shut up and listen to this,
- Fuck! Talk,
- It's me,
This is Walter Smith,
Now what?
Look out the window,
Listen to me, I...
I don't even know who these people are,
Or what they do, I cook the books,
You know, set up shell companies, offshore accounts,
And then I would encrypt it onto a disk and leave it at the drop point,
I mean...
It was never face to face,
I want to see my family,
- Jane? Amanda?
font color="#aa5ff">-
Shh, Shh,
It's OK, baby,
We're gonna be out of here in just a minute,
And I see you've taken a bullet,
Walter, you're looking fairly banged-up as well,
How do I know you still have what I need?
- Trinidad...
- Wait,
- Go ahead,
- Trinidad Mercantile, Dominican Republic,
Uh... Michelangelo Sister Trust,
The account number's Brenda 65007265,
Um... Um...
- Dutch Antilles National...
- Shut up,
- Dutch Antilles...
- Shut up, Walter,
- You're good,

You can let 'em leave now, right?
Just let my family leave,
Walk 'em to the door,
I leave with 'em, Smith stays here,
Everybody's happy,
I haven't seen your face,
I haven't seen any of your faces!
- I leave you alone, you leave me alone,
font color="#aa5ff">-
You're negotiating?
Is that what this is, Talley?
You're gonna wear me down?
I'm just trying to bring us all home,
Cut Walter loose, Send him over next to me, and we will disappear into the day,
Let them go, I'll stay here, Just let them go,
You get this one thing: I don't bargain,
I give, You take, That's it,
Cut him loose,
Good,
Hands, Hands up, in the air,
Oh, you're a fucking dead man, You're a fucking dead man!
Thank you very fucking much, He hasn't seen your face?
- He's seen my face!
- My family hasn't seen his face,
- What are you waiting for? Kill him!
- They didn't see his face,
Come on,
My family hasn't seen Walter Smith's face!
Just let 'em go!
- Come on, what are you waiting for?
- Just let 'em leave! Just let 'em go now!
