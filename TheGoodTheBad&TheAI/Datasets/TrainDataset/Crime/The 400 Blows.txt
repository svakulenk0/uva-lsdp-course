THE 400 BLOWS
This film is dedicated...
to the memory of Andre Bazin
Doinel! Bring me that!
Indeed! Go to the corner!
Quiet!
We'll collect them in 30 seconds!
Quiet!
Line heads, get ready!
I'll count to 3
Collect in back!
- Gimme!
- Wait a sec!
- What is it?
- He won't give it!
No favoritism!
Brown-noser!
Is everyone's paper in?
You may go!
Sorry! Not you!
Recess is a reward,
not an obligation!
Here
suffered Antoine Doinel unfairly...
punished by a prof
for a pin-up clad barely
So it's now forsooth,
eye for eye, tooth for tooth!
Alright, champs,
maybe you need a ref!
You can train for 3 days!
No recess!
Come look! This is funny!
What's so interesting there?
Take your seats!
Bravo!
We have a new Juvenal in our class!
But he can't tell
an Alexandrine from a decasyllable!
For tomorrow you'll conjugate...
Doinel, sit down!
in all tenses of the indicative...
conditional and subjunctive moods...
Your notebooks!
I dirty the classroom walls...
and misuse French versification
The Hare...
Doinel, go to the janitor and...
get something
to remove that nonsense...
or else you'll lick it off!
Richer, who said
you could change seats?
In the days when the bushes...
the bushes...
were aflame with flowers...
bright red...
When already the dark tips...
When already...
the dark tips...
of my long ears...
were seen...
above my head...
In the still unripe rye...
I munched on...
the leaves...
Pointing to the sky
One day...
comma... weary I lay...
in my den...
with sleep-filled eyes...
When little Margot
found me by surprise!
- Right, Simonot?
- It wasn't me, sir!
Sure! The other guy!
True, she liked me...
very much...
my gentle mistress!
How good to me...
so caring... such tenderness!
How she held me on her lap...
and kissed me!
What fool whistled?
Confess or I'll punish anybody!
Right, Simonot?
I swear, sir!
It wasn't me!
And you're cowards!
What a class!
I've known morons
but at least they didn't let it show
They hid in their corner
And you?
Call that clean! You've made
it dirtier! Copy the poem!
Your parents'll pay
What'll France be like in 10 years?
- All guys rob their parents.
- Yeah but it's hard
Even Mauricet!
Mauricet!
Where'd you buy those goggles?
A department store
Did ya swipe the money
from your dad or your ma?
Don't tell me
ya don't go through their pockets!
And ya got me caught earlier!
Ya bastard!
- Your days're numbered!
- You'll get yours!
I'll never do it all tonight
That prof's a bastard
It's his job!
But before I'm drafted...
I'll bash his head in!
That I would have dirtied
the classroom walls
- Evening, Mama!
- Good evening...
Where's the flour?
- What flour?
- You didn't buy what I wrote down!
- Where's the list I left you?
- I lost it
No wonder
you get such bad grades!
Get my slippers!
In the bedroom!
Under the bed!
I need some flour
Go get it at once!
Yes, Mama
They used forceps.
He came out ass first!
It's hereditary!
His mother was the same way
It means nothing! Look at my Fanny!
It was over in 10 minutes
But for the little one,
if I hadn't had a Caesarean...
we wouldn't be talkin' now!
And my sister... One a year!
Can you imagine?
They finally took out everything.
Blood all over the place!
In a rush, son?
I just got hell for some flour
Don't upset your mother!
She has to be handled with care
- What's that?
- An anti-fog spotlight
I'm gonna try it out Sunday
Look at your son!
All flour-faced!
I'm not in the mood!
I was hoping you were!
And my change?
- I need money for the cafeteria.
- Ask your dad
A storm's brewing!
- Papa, for the cafeteria...
- What?
I need 1,000 francs
Ya ask for 1,000 and hope for 500.
So ya only need 300
Here's 100
Take 500.
But your mom's supposed to pay that
The scissors!
Where are the scissors?
It's not funny!
No homework now! It's time to eat
Right! Each thing has its time and
place. That way, the cows're safe!
Is that a new pen?
I made a swap for it
You swap a lot lately!
What's that smell?
It's the fish
And how!
Ask your mom if her hot-pad is hot
Why?
For laughs!
You can clear the table now
Your cousin phoned.
His wife is expecting again
Her 4th in 3 years?
They're like rabbits. Disgusting!
And what about our kid
during vacation?
- Who're summer camps for?
- He'd have fun there
It's 8 months off!
Never too early to plan a vacation!
Don't pull so hard!
Great, huh?
Lions' Club...
What's all this?
Take it easy!
For Sunday's race...
shall I pick the Chevreuse Valley
or along the Oise?
On Sunday I rest
I'm going to see Huguette
But I'm the race organiser!
I'm sick of housework...
And dates in the afternoon!
I mean the edible kind!
What're you waiting for?
Go to bed!
G'night!
You can be so stupid!
If you could only take a joke...
Your auto races are a waste of time!
The garbage!
Lights out as soon as you're in bed!
I make contacts!
One day I'll be vice-president!
Hurry up! It's late!
I didn't hear the alarm
That I would have dirtied
the classroom walls!
There's no socks around these holes!
Buy a new pair!
The others are in the laundry
I gave you money for sheets
for the kid's bed
He prefers his sleeping bag
Right, honey?
At least I'm warm in it
You still here?
Bye, Pa! Mama!
Don't rush so fast!
We'll get locked out
and have to see the director
- No need to hurry!
- Why?
The prof said he won't let ya in
- He means it?
- He can't stand you
- Have you money?
- Yes for the canteen
Trust me... This way!
What'll we do now?
Follow me!
Put your satchel with mine
Antoine! He saw me!
- Which one's he?
- With dark hair
But he should be in school!
- You'll get it!
- She won't dare tell Dad
- And the guy?
- Never saw him before!
So you're safe!
I'm going to school tomorrow...
but I'll need an excuse.
How'll you manage?
I've got an old one.
I'll cut off the date
You can borrow it and copy it
But the handwriting?
Imitate your mother's
That'll be hard. It's angular
- Don't worry, it'll work.
- I hope so!
- Bye!
- Bye!
I ask you to please...
excuse...
my son...
Rene... who was ill...
My son Rene!
It smells like something burnt!
That's downstairs
Set the table just for 2
Why? Is Mom gone?
She phoned me to say
she'll be late tonight
Her boss needs her for the budget
So we'll cook
and have a man-to-man dinner
She mentioned
some eggs someplace
I know where they are
Did you study hard today?
What'd you do?
The hare
And the tortoise?
No, just questions about the hare
- Did you answer right?
- He didn't ask me
You've got to speak up!
If not, you're out of the race
You've got to take
the initiative in life
Have you thought
of your mother's birthday?
It's the 17th
I hope you'll give her something
You hear me?
I know what you think
She's been hard on you lately but...
she's a very nervous woman
Put yourself in her shoes!
She has her housework
plus an afternoon job
And this place is too tiny
But we'll move.
I got a lead on a new place
In an office
it's always the same story
Women are exploited
and can't defend themselves
But she loves you! Oh shit!
- Where'd you put my Michelin guide?
- I didn't touch it
You know I can't stand lying
I put it in its place yesterday
It's not me!
It's crazy how things disappear!
It's not me
I'll ask your mother
It's time for bed
Don't forget the garbage
My boss drove me home
Exactly! I couldn't say no to that
- Night work pays double.
- Wait'll ya see my pay!
That kind of overtime is paid cash!
No wonder
you need to rest on Sunday!
Where's my Michelin?
No idea! The kid might know
- He doesn't.
- He's a liar!
- Like you!
- If ya raised him right...
Shit! I gave him a name!
I feed him!
I'm sick of your complaints! Fed up!
If ya can't stand him, say so
We'll put him in an orphanage...
so I can have some peace!
We'll eat out
till the end of the month!
How? I don't have a clean shirt!
You could at least do the collars
You and your anti-foglight!
Just to show off!
I bought it second-hand
Go open the door
Maybe it's the gas man
They send a notice first
I'm in Antoine's class.
Is he any better?
Why?
He missed school yesterday
Ya hear that?
You don't seem surprised
Why should I be?
He's capable of anything
What'll my excuse be?
The bigger the lie,
the better it works
When Ma broke her leg,
I went back...
without an excuse
I can't make up a story like that
We mustn't go in together
Right. You go first
So there you are!
Extra homework made you sick, eh?
Your folks fell for it?
I'd like to see
what kind of excuse you have
- Let's have it.
- I don't have one
You expect to get away
with it like that?
It'd be too easy!
Sir, it's my mother
What about her?
She's just died
I'm sorry... I didn't know...
Was she ill?
Yes, sir
You could've told me.
You should confide in your teachers
Go join the others
And your excuse?
Never mind!
- 'Tis best a thorn in the wood...
...than in the ass!
If you'd wash your ears
you'd hear your prompter!
Up your'ear!
He's just trying to confuse me
- Enough! Continue...
- I'm all mixed up
Than in the flowers...
...the flowers.
'Tis best independence...
And incessant peril...
Than slavery...
In eternal April.
You're an eternal loafer! Sit down!
I knew it at home!
- Doinel!
- Yes, sir!
I'm sorry...
Simonot!
The Hare...
Sit down!
He must be punished
within the limits...
He's beyond all limits!
Only his parents
can deal with such a mistake
We'll settle this tonight at home!
What'll you do?
After this I can't live
with my parents any more
I've got to disappear
Mine've been through worse!
Yeah, but I want
to live my own life
I'll write them a letter
- Right now?
- It's best that way
Where'll ya sleep?
I don't know. I don't care
I've got an idea
Be at the Pigalle fountain
in 1 hour
OK
It's my uncle's old print shop
The floor collapsed
under the heavy machines
Will it collapse again?
It can't fall any lower.
You'll be warm here
A mattress...
This'll do for a pillow
It's real heavy!
Go for a walk till midnight
- Keep my satchel until tomorrow.
- OK
Dear Parents... I understand
the seriousness of my lie
Why'd he kill me instead of you?
A matter of preference!
Life between us is impossible
So I'm going to try my luck
in the city or elsewhere
I want to become a man
When I see you again,
we'll have a full explanation
I close with kisses... Antoine
- It's normal that he hates me?
- You're hard on him
He gets on my nerves!
- Can you help me catch him?
- Sure!
- Your sister?
- No, her dog got away
- It's a lost dog or hers?
- I don't know!
- May I help?
- Yes! The more, the better!
- What's his name?
- I've no idea
Forget it, kid
But I saw him first!
Understand me?
- Doinel!
- Yes, sir?
- Did things explode last night?
- No, everything was fine!
Parents spoil 'em rotten!
Chabrol, want some help?
The last question is even easier
as if you're lisping
I can't. Not everyone can use
their tongue like you said
Quiet!
S... Si... Go sit down!
Impudent!
Now you!
Answer me!
Doinel?
Frochot, take over until I return
We don't know how to handle him!
Madam, you don't deserve
such a rascal
My poor baby!
Where'd you spend the night?
- In a print shop.
- At a printer's?
I don't care if he's last
so long as he behaves!
Fine!
Maybe it's... glandular
You mustn't catch cold
And now to bed!
I'm not sleepy
You'll be better off in our bed
You know, I was your age once
Kids forget that!
I was stubborn
and wouldn't confide in my parents
So I wrote everything in a diary
Nobody's ever read it.
One day I'll show it to you
At your age I went on vacation
with a shepherd boy I liked but...
they caught us! Ma made me swear
not to see him again...
and never told Papa.
So I cried a lot but I obeyed her
We should always obey our mothers!
We can have secrets!
What did you mean in your letter...
about having a full explanation?
I meant about my bad behavior
and why I don't study hard
So, tell me...
I don't know how to listen...
so I want to quit
and earn my own living
That's crazy! You've no idea!
I so regret not going
beyond high school!
Your dad has only
an elementary diploma
It hampers him!
I know school
teaches lots of useless stuff
Algebra and science don't...
help many people
But French! You always need it
for writing letters!
Let's share another secret, OK?
On your next French essay...
if you're among...
the top 5,
I'll give you 1,000 francs!
But don't tell your father!
Suddenly the dying man
rose up on his fists...
and shot a lightning glance
at his terrified children
The hair at his nape moved.
His wrinkles quivered
His face brightened
A breath wafted his face, making it
sublime. He lifted his fist...
and shouted
Archimedes' famous word...
Eureka! I have found it!
Describe a major event you witnessed
and which concerned you personally
Eureka! I have found it!
The Death...
of My Grandfather
The monkey's finally laid
the new typist!
She's made the most of it!
She got herself named
executive secretary
She fills all the requirements!
Gotta be careful of her now
because of pillow talk!
When she was on the road, I told her
how to juggle her expense account
Instead of that,
she stayed in 3-star hotels!
Say, I still haven't found
my Michelin hotel guide
One of you has moved it
Oh, you and your Michelin!
I don't like mysteries
What's on the stove?
Nothing! I'm sure!
Put it out! Don't yell!
Get some water!
Ya blockhead!
What made ya
light a candle in there?
It was for Balzac!
Balzac? Ya take me for a fool?
- For my French essay!
- Yes, he promised me something
What? A bonus for fire damage?
Ya need more than a candle!
- Want my lighter?
- Don't be silly!
For as long as you're living here,
you'll do as I say!
If not, it means military academy!
Know what that is?
You'll find out!
And you'll toe the line!
Know what we'll do
for a change of air?
We'll all go to the movies tonight!
Fine! A great method of education!
- How's your French essay?
- Not bad
Listen, Julian... Trust us!
He wants to surprise us
- I don't like this!
- Take us to the movies?
- What's playing?
- Paris Is Ours
- If you're plotting...
- Rather not go?
Sure, I'll go!
I've worked hard. I deserve it!
But the Gaumont Theatre
doesn't like arsonists!
My ice cream bar was good!
I'd never had strawberry
They're not in season!
She really had... how shall I say...
she had lots of...
- That's all you ever notice!
- Lots of class!
- I liked that movie.
- Yeah, but it wasn't funny
Not funny? But it had depth!
- What?
- Depth!
- The movie!
- Yeah...
It's time for bed
Beddy-bye!
It's Satan's general and his staff!
Your mom's got nice legs, eh?
Back to our happy hearth...
but a little smoky!
The garbage, honey!
I hope I won't regret
trying to win him over
Doinel!
If your essay is first today
it's because I've decided...
to rank them
by starting from the bottom
Your search for the absolute
led you straight to a zero
For you who don't know Balzac...
it concerns A Gloomy Affair
Doinel has the right to take
the death of a relative
as his subject...
although we know
he easily sacrifices his dear ones
whenever convenient
I didn't copy, sir!
Listen to this!
Suddenly the dying man rose up...
and shot a lightning glance
at his terrified children
His hair stood on end
and his eyebrows arched
His face brightened
with a sublime look
He shouted Archimedes' famous
word... Eureka! I've found it!
Well, I found it too!
- You plagiarist!
- It's not true!
Take your essay at once
to the principal
Colombel, go with him
And stay out
till the end of the term!
What's with you?
I sat next to him.
He didn't copy it!
Want to be expelled?
That's OK
Such impudence!
- Get out!
- Expel me but don't kick me out!
Out!
That's illegal!
I'll show you
who makes the laws here!
Did you take him?
- He ran away.
- Ran away?
I slugged him and ran
And you?
He threw me out
till after Christmas
Now I really can't go home.
Dad said
he'd put me in an academy
- What's that?
- Something military
You'd have a uniform and a future
No thanks!
If only it were the Navy!
I'd like to see the ocean.
I've seen the Channel,
the Atlantic...
and the Mediterranean
but not the North Sea
Stay at my house. We'll manage!
Holy cow! A horse!
It's my dad's. A souvenir!
What a huge place!
Clean off the sofa.
You can sleep here
And your parents?
Never here! Mom drinks
and Dad is always...
at the races.
This place is wide open
We need to start a business
Yeah, we need money
But we need some to start with
In that case...
I'll use part of my inheritance
Quiet! Mom may be around
Anyone here?
- Hello, madam!
- Little devil!
- Seen your mother lately?
- Today after school
She makes sure
her hours never coincide with mine
She must be up to something
Where's the fruit?
Here!
Hurry up! We'll miss the news!
Yeah, I know, Inspector,
you'll lock me up for life
But drop by Duely's around 8:00
Ya might meet a pal
with sharp teeth
I'm thirsty!
It's already empty!
Come on! Play!
You threw a 12?
It's my old man!
Help shake the blankets!
That's enough!
What's going on? It's a smokehouse!
A real gambling den!
I'll deduct 3 cigars
from your allowance
Bucephalus is not for your junk!
He's worth a million!
A work of art!
I'll never give him up
until the last minute!
Now turn out the lights
and go to sleep!
- 'Night, Pa!
- Goodnight!
- Not bad!
- By god!
Great!
Give me your Michelin
A million'd be great!
My dad would kill me
because of that horse
With a million
we'll find a beach...
open a boat business
and no one'll bother us!
- Make up your mind.
- Dad's office has some
- Don't back down!
- We can't sell it. They're numbered
- We won't sell it, we'll pawn it!
- Smart!
Ma pawned all our stuff
