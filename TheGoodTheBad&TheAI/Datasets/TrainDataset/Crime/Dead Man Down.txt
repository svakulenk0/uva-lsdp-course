DARCY: It wasn't meant to
be this way. You know?
We make our plans, sure.
But life...
Life is what happens
to you along the way.
You know, at first,
I didn't want this.
I didn't want to connect.
I didn't want to get involved.
And she kept on at me.
"This is what life is. This is
why we're here, to connect."
"To build."
We're here to build something.
And then we had Theo.
And then I understood
that she was right.
We're not meant to be alone.
You know what she said to me?
She said that even
the most damaged heart
can be mended.
Even the most damaged heart.
Yeah.
No, I'm with Vic.
What?
I can't let you in
until Alphonse is home.
Alphonse is on his way.
Where?
In the basement.
Oh, Paulie.
No.
DARCY: It's Paul.
Why is the alarm off?
I told you that you
should always have it on!
She said that she
didn't turn it off.
Go.
"719, now you realize."
What?
DARCY: What the fuck?
This shit is crazy.
Now he's killing us.
Call the locksmith.
And get that asshole from the
alarm company over here.
"Now you realize."
I know who's
doing this to me.
Killed for less.
A little uncouth to
come without a call.
There's a better
place for you to be.
Get out. Go.
Am I gonna get paid?
Have you seen this man?
Paul? Everyone
knows Paul's missing.
I want you to think
before you answer.
'Cause I'm getting
to the bottom of this.
The bottom of what?
Three months of letters.
Three months of torment.
Not being able to leave
my house without wondering
if some coward is gonna
sneak up behind me and...
Paul was looking into this.
And I think he found exactly
what he was looking for.
But before he
could come and tell me,
my friend Paul shows up
strangled in my freezer.
You've got a lot of enemies,
don't you, Alphonse?
Three months ago you and
I had our disagreement!
I raised my take to 25%
to allow you to continue
to operate in my buildings.
I started getting letters
three months ago!
That's no fucking coincidence!
That's not fucking accurate!
You asked for 30%, and Lon told
you, you could only ask me for 20%.
So if anyone was bent out of shape,
it was fucking you, Alphonse.
Who's in this picture?
I don't fucking know. Who the
fuck is in this picture?
I don't know!
What am I supposed to realize?
What does 719 mean? What am
I going to fucking realize?
What am I gonna
fucking realize?
Darcy, want to give me
a hand here, mate?
He ain't got shit
to do with this!
I've been picking up from
Harry for over a year.
No. He's a fucking liar
so you shut the fuck up.
I'm gonna ask you again.
What am I supposed to realize?
I don't care what you
think I've done to you,
you are not sanctioned
to kill me.
That much I do fucking know.
So it's not on,
you even coming here!
"Not on"?
The term is, "Not cool."
It's you fucking English.
You always do shit like that.
Alphonse, just...
Well...
You also make your
sevens like this.
You
are not sanctioned
to kill me.
Fuck it.
What the fuck
y'all waiting for?
Do it.
Fuck, you've been hit.
Don't worry about it.
DOCTOR: A bit better
this time.
NURSE: Will you be all right to
drive yourself home, Beatrice?
Why don't you go over and
introduce yourself to him?
Oh, Mom.
What are you doing?
You're supposed to
lie down and relax.
Huh?
I was relaxing so much
I saw a white light.
Well, if you see it again,
don't walk into it.
I still have a lot of things to
take out on you for my childhood.
It's beautiful.
I love the color.
Me too.
It's very pretty.
I'll run your bath.
You don't stop looking at him.
You should ask him out.
Go out.
Live your life.
You're alive, after all.
Hello?
Hello?
I got your note.
Hi.
Uh...
VICTOR:
Go out.
Go out on the balcony.
I...
I wasn't sure you got it.
I was wondering if I
put it in the wrong box?
No.
No. It's mine.
So...
The note.
I just thought since we...
I thought it would be
nice to finally meet you.
Beatrice.
Victor.
No, thanks.
You don't talk a lot.
Not much, no.
It's okay.
I talk enough for both of us.
I talk too much.
Everybody says so.
Um...
You speak French?
I'd like to.
Yeah?
Sure.
Another language?
Hungarian.
You're Hungarian?
You don't have an accent.
I worked very hard
to get rid of it.
So...
A job?
I'm...
Right now I'm
dabbling in real estate.
The people I work for, they buy
buildings in need of renovations.
Fix them up and run them.
Hmm.
You? A job?
Yeah.
I was involved in
a car accident last year.
I was a beautician before.
They rebuilt part of my face.
But it's kind of hard
to give advice on beauty now.
And...
I have to smile
a lot in my job.
Most of the time,
it hurts to smile.
I don't get to smile
so much in my work.
No?
No.
Maybe you and I should switch jobs.
Yeah.
So, what else?
I swear sometimes.
Especially when I drink.
Me too.
Fuck.
Shit.
Careful. You're smiling.
Tonight it's worth it.
I want to take you somewhere.
So where are we going?
Are we going to a club?
No.
No?
Very cold.
Very cold.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, then are
we going to a park?
Hmm...
Warmer.
I thought you talk a lot?
I thought you don't.
Must be the company.
Usually, I don't.
You can turn here.
Pull over. Just there.
You're afraid I'll think you came
tonight because you felt sorry for me.
You don't have to
play these games, Victor.
I know why you really came.
You're just being careful.
You want to find out if the girl who's
been watching you saw what you did.
I saw you kill this man.
I saw you strangle him.
I saw you take him away.
Now you're trying to clean up a
mess that cannot be cleaned up.
But, I...
I think your secret
will be safe with me.
This is the man
who hit my car
when he was drunk.
This is the man
who did this to me.
I want you to kill him.
As you did with
the man in your apartment.
Wait a minute.
No.
If you don't do it, I'll call the
police and tell them what I saw.
What the fuck are you...
His BMW.
It's fixed.
As if it had never happened.
But I can't be fixed.
He served three weeks.
Three weeks for
what he did to me.
Stupid judge, he sat there
and he looked at my face.
I want it done.
If you don't do it,
I'll call the police
and I'll tell them what I saw.
You'll do it!
You want to save yourself?
Do it!
Fuck.
He didn't pay.
I understand.
He didn't pay.
Stop saying that!
I understand!
Are you gonna do it?
What I did, it has
nothing to do with you.
You have to do this!
He ruined my life.
I have nothing.
I am nothing.
I want it done
as soon as possible.
Then I will forget.
I will begin my life.
And I will forget
that I ever met you.
Do you know what it is
to kill a man?
I will forget
that I ever met you.
It's not a bug!
It's not a rat!
I would never
kill a bug or a rat!
He's much worse
than these things!
You don't know what
you're getting into with me!
You have no fucking idea!
I could have called the police.
I saved your life.
Now you're gonna
give me back mine.
If you're not going to kill me
you don't have a choice.
Back so soon?
Beatrice.
Beatrice,
tell me what went wrong.
Beatrice.
Ah, Laszlo.
Sorry I'm late.
No problem.
You look good.
It's good to see you.
Were you worried I was
going to forget your name?
Ah...
Convention.
You forget what it's like.
It's Andras who gave us
the body for your grave.
VICTOR: Whose body?
Someone who
deserved it, I'm sure.
Is this where
the whores are kept?
No, no, you are looking for
your mother's boat. Two down.
We met.
Two days after when
they left you for dead.
VICTOR: Yeah.
ANDRAS: Soviet modified
Dragunov.
Shoots 7.62 by 5.4 rounds.
With all Russian PSO scopes. Comes
with bayonet suppressor as well.
Heavier than I expected.
I'll take it.
Okay. All set.
What did he say?
Andras?
For 14 months you've
infiltrated Alphonse.
They wanted to know
why you've been waiting for so
long to do what needs to be done.
He said if he was lucky enough
to be standing, like you are,
he'd want revenge, too.
But we're all worried
you wait too long.
Always kill the devil quickly when you find him.
That was his advice.
I said you wanted to be close
enough to watch him suffer.
But I really don't know
the reason you're waiting.
VICTOR ON VIDEO: So now...
Now.
VICTOR: Say it
in English for me.
DELPHINE:
MATILDE:
VICTOR:
VICTOR:
VICTOR:
DELPHINE:
VICTOR: Bigger smile than that. That's
not the biggest smile you have.
So?
Nothing. No one
has seen your brother.
It's been two weeks,
I am telling you.
He never goes more than a few
days without calling me.
You know him. Sometimes
he likes to get away.
No. Something is wrong.
What have I done to you?
Where have you taken me?
I need foodstuffs.
I can help you.
If you let me go,
he will spare you.
My brother, he will
not stop looking for me.
And he will find you.
Even if you get his money,
even if they pay,
he will find you.
You don't know who
you're messing with!
He Will kill you!
He Will kill you!
BOY 1: Monster's here.
Monster!
Hey, monster...
If you put a bag over your head,
we might hook up with you.
You have to
take off your shoes.
My mom likes to
keep the floor clean.
BEATRICE: How long
will it take?
Long enough to be prepared.
You say he goes to
this bar every night?
Yeah.
You know where he works?
He's looking for work.
As much as I
could find out, I did.
I never thought
about it before.
Revenge.
But when I saw you kill
that man in your apartment,
I knew I had my answer.
Why did you do it?
I just want to
know more about you.
I'm not here by choice.
Oh!
We have company.
She can't hear us. She lost
most of her hearing as a child.
Oh, I forgot my
cookies in the oven.
I took them out for you, Mom.
Oh, okay.
I'm looking for
my hearing aids.
Mom, I'd like you
to meet Victor.
Oh!
Hello, Victor.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Well, you look good.
You want to stay for lunch?
We're having chicken. Lemon chicken.
It's very good.
And cookies, too.
We love cookies in this house.
You want cookies?
I can't stay, madame.
Oh, I want to show
you something.
Pictures of Beatrice.
You can see she
has excellent genes.
Isn't she pretty?
You see how beautiful she is?
Mmm.
I want it done as
soon as possible.
VALENTINE: Yes.
Victor has to go.
, Victor.
It was nice meeting you.
Oh, I forgot...
You'll hear from me
when it's done.
Cookies.
Uh...
It's for you.
Take them.
A bit grumpy.
Him, I have
a good feeling about.
Crackerjack.
MAN: Got any grass?
That depends.
Information is power,
my friend.
You see anyone
take a photo up there?
Already told.
Already told who?
Another guy.
A guy like you.
This is my friend Paul.
Did you tell him?
ALPHONSE:
GORDON:
You know,
people are flipping out.
You weren't sanctioned
to do Harry.
Or his men. Or leave a house
full of dead Jamaicans!
No, I told you...
Look, Lon... Imagine what
the fuck I'm dealing with?
No. You need to
some see me right now.
You don't appreciate
the severity of this.
You come now.
I'm gonna be at Cafe Cora.
So...
We got dead Jamaicans, huh?
I'm listening.
Well, Lon,
for the last three months,
Harry was messing with me.
Trying to freak me out.
Sending little notes like this
with pictures, and threats
and fucked-up shit.
I don't think he was too happy
with the percentage deal.
Okay.
I went in there to get answers,
not dead Jamaicans.
Mmm-hmm.
Turned out that way.
I lost two guys.
And truth is, I could have been
just as dead as both of them.
You know Joe Bragg?
And Herbert?
Lowell Khan.
And Weinberg?
They're my colleagues.
Yeah.
Each
received photos like these.
Yeah?
DARCY ON PHONE: Yo, Vic.
Where you at?
I'm in the middle of something.
Hey, listen, I was right.
Alphonse is still in danger.
This was not Harry and
his men doing this shit.
How do you know that?
You know Cafe Cora?
Can you get there?
I can find it.
Yeah, look, Alphonse is
there with Lon Gordon.
I'm gonna call
the rest of the crew
and get them down there,
all right?
How'd you know it wasn't Harry?
I'll be there in five.
Fuck.
Yo, Terry.
Yeah?
I'm gonna look at
these photos another way.
'Cause whoever's doing this is
taking it seriously enough now
to let us know that the loans
to you, they're not secure.
That's respect enough
to let us know his intentions.
You're not gonna be around.
You may not be
around to collect.
Lon, that's exactly what
Harry wanted you to think.
I got a note, too.
This morning.
It's addressed to you.
Englishmen and Jamaicans, they
don't send notes like this.
Not after they've been killed
in their own house.
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
And this key was taped to it.
You know what that key is for?
I want you to get
the books and the deeds
together for me now, all right?
Every building you owe us for.
You understand this, don't you?
So the uptown buildings, you're
pulling out of the deal?
We're not
pulling out, Alphonse.
You're just in no condition
right now to pull in.
Shit!
TERRY: Alphonse...
Not right now.
TERRY: There's a problem.
We need to go.
He's here.
What?
MAN 1: Oh, shit! MAN 2: Blotto's down.
Get the shit!
TERRY: Jesus! Get down!
Darcy! It's coming
from the roof!
Get in the car!
LUCO: Up there!
ALPHONSE: Go, go, go!
Get the fuck out of here!
Luco! You watch the elevator!
Dolph and Charles
come upstairs!
Kilroy, back stairs
with me! Now!
Darcy, he got out
from the fifth floor.
What?
He went out the window!
From the fifth fucking floor?
He's crazy.
Darcy!
What the fuck?
Shit! Fuck!
Victor?
Shit!
Where is he?
KILROY: They wasted Goff.
DARCY: They wasted
Charles, too.
Over here! Come on!
Get in!
Come on!
MAN 1: Over here!
MAN 2: Come on!
What the fuck are you doing?
Turn the fuck around!
Turn the fuck around!
What the fuck!
Hi. I'm Beatrice.
You told me to get here.
I'm sorry I made him late.
What's going on?
See you later.
DARCY: Did you see anyone
running here, Vic? No.
Oh, shit!
He took out Blotto, Goff
and even Charles. Who?
KILROY: We lost him.
Fuck!
You guys all right?
Tell him what you
told me about the cab.
DARCY: This guy
in the building,
he saw a man take this photo
from the stairwell.
Then they see him get into a cab.
A gypsy cab.
Paul was there, too.
He found out the same thing.
It must've led him to something,
because he was wasted for it.
Find out where the cab went.
What did you do that for?
What I do what for?
Go looking with the pictures.
You've only been on this crew
a month longer than I have.
What if all this shit
that's happening to Alphonse
is because of something that
went down before you came, huh?
This is an opportunity of
magnumus proportions to me.
How's that?
Of finding my next step
in the organization.
Yeah, well, there might not be
much of an organization left.
I could run this place
for him, Victor.
Better than Terry, a whole lot
better than fucking Kilroy.
I ain't joking around.
If I could just
crack this shit for...
This is serious shit, Darcy.
Have enough money to buy Lise
and Theo what they need.
Move up the ladder.
What the fuck!
It's Lise's car.
Mine's in the shop.
What? Are you back
with her?
Yeah, she's acknowledging me.
It's a start, right?
I promised her I'd
make a plan. Get ahead.
For her and for Theo.
Just don't get too smart.
You saw what happened to Paul.
I don't want anything
to happen to you.
I'm smarter than Paul.
I'm tired of being
taken for a fucking douche.
I saw Alphonse respected me back there.
Oh, yeah?
I saw it in his eyes.
All right. We're good.
That's it.
Go on.
What the fuck.
DELPHINE: I tied
my shoe today.
Hello. This is Victor,
is Beatrice...
Hello. This is Victor.
Is Beatrice there?
What? There's no answer,
no one is there.
BEATRICE: Hello.
It's me.
I believe you have
something of mine?
Yeah.
Why did you follow me?
I wanted to find out
more about you.
I think it's lucky I did.
You want some water?
Sure.
BEATRICE: So, who are you?
My real name is Laszlo Kerik.
I was born in Hungary.
A few years ago my wife
and I came to America.
I was an engineer before.
We came here looking for work.
We took an apartment
in a building.
It was a building
they wanted to control.
The man I saw?
They got most people
out of the building.
One night they came
and they fired some shots.
To scare us.
So we would leave.
A bullet went through a wall,
and my daughter was
killed while she slept.
We were going to testify.
My wife and I.
The man responsible
for it all, Alphonse,
he gave his orders to make
sure he never went to trial.
And they were followed.
He was afraid to
use his own guys,
so they sent a crew
of Albanians after us.
They killed my wife,
and they thought
they killed me, too.
And they should
have made sure of it.
Cigarette?
Yeah.
When I manage to forget
what happened to me,
when there are no mirrors,
and no people that reminds me,
when my mom makes me laugh...
In these moments,
I have hope.
says that I...
That it's these moments
that makes the pain bearable.
These moments.
I should try and find them where
I can and hang onto them.
But they're fleeting.
And then I remember,
and I'm filled
with so much hate
so I want to set
the whole world on fire.
I'm sorry I made you tell me
about your family.
I don't want to be one of those
people that reminds you.
When you're the one who is
going to help me forget.
These men, they don't
seem easy to beat.
And you might have used
up all your luck. So...
It's yellow...
Uh-uh.
Chartreuse.
Keep it.
I need you around.
Rabbits don't
come in chartreuse.
Did you eat the cookies?
No.
Maman makes a good cookie.
I only ask you to
return the Tupperware.
She likes her Tupperware.
Have you made any progress?
I will.
I know.
Because I realize now that if I call
the police and tell them what I saw,
it's not prison
you're afraid of.
It's that you won't get
to finish your revenge.
I'm going to
sleep in my own bed.
And why are you going to
sleep in your own bed?
Because Daddy keeps
care of the monsters.
VICTOR: Why, baby?
Tell me once more, why?
Because Daddy keeps
care of the monsters.
VICTOR: Bigger smile than that! That's
not the biggest smile you have.
MATILDE: And why are you going
to sleep in your own bed?
DELPHINE: Because Daddy
keeps care of the monsters.
VICTOR: Why, baby?
Tell me once more. Why?
Because Daddy keeps
care of the monsters.
I'm so happy that you're here.
Yeah.
I just needed
some time, Florence.
Now I'm going to cry.
I was worried when you
didn't contact my friend.
Nicholas, the therapist.
Oh, yeah.
He really did wonders
helping me out.
He could help you.
I found someone else.
As long as you're
getting the help you need.
Yeah.
I'm in good hands.
You clever motherfucker.
TERRY: Open the fucking windows.
It's fucking hot in here.
Hey, Kilroy,
you want something to eat?
Yeah, I could eat.
I'm in my office.
KILROY: Anything going on?
No.
Any pick-ups?
Make sure you
keep your cell on.
I don't know
what AI's got going.
GREGOR: Are you sure
it's the AR 43?
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm looking at it right here.
Then there is nothing wrong
with your remote.
There's a barrier. Your
signal won't get through.
that is used in most banks
and government buildings.
What is the application
for your trigger?
That's interference.
You will have to be inside
the IR ring, or forget it.
Unless you start from scratch,
go to a new system.
No, I can't do that.
Not enough time.
Too much interference. You
would have to detonate inside.
I lost a niece
and her little one.
Now you know everything.
No. No, I don't.
Uh...
How come an engineer knows
so much about guns?
Military service.
Back home.
So, what you said on the phone.
Is that your plan?
To get everybody
into this warehouse?
Yes. Alphonse is
always there.
I just need to get
the Albanians there, too.
There are many men.
But your bombs doesn't work.
They work.
That's one way
of looking at it.
Another is that you don't
care if you get out of there.
You'd rather die than fail.
Don't worry about it.
I'll be around long enough
to do what you asked me to do.
I don't want you to do that.
Bring me food.
My mom likes to cook.
It would just go to
waste otherwise.
I'll wedge it in between the mustard
and those plastic explosives.
You may not care if
you get out alive,
but in the meantime,
you should eat.
My rabbit's foot. If you don't
believe in it, I'll take it back.
Bye.
Sign right here.
Ilir.
Where did you get this?
A delivery came.
Same bogus
return address again.
They have your brother.
There's a little girl.
TERRY ON PHONE: Hello?
Hey, it's Fonz. Listen.
He says he can close the financing
on those uptown buildings.
And he don't know anything
about Lon pulling out.
He wants to see
the Commerce Building.
So I'm gonna meet him
there tonight at 9:00.
I don't know, man. What
if our problem shows up?
Pulls some fucking
"I don't know" kind of shit.
No, you're
the only one that knows.
I gotta go.
Yeah.
Yo, Vic. You with anybody?
Yeah. I'm busy.
Well, drop your dick.
I found the gypsy cab.
The guy at the cab company says
he remembers Paul.
Paul was there.
I'm like
a detective, man.
Like Columbo.
I'm scaring myself.
Vic? Right.
DARCY: Hey, Vic. Vic.
This girl you're seeing.
She your girlfriend?
No. No, it ain't serious.
She's got... Her face.
Yeah. Car accident.
Did it affect her?
You have no idea.
Hey, you never
mentioned her before.
You embarrassed about me?
Yeah, I'm embarrassed
about you.
You're embarrassed about your friends?
Huh? Fuck you talking about?
So. This is it
right here.
Huh?
The cab dropped
off Paul right here.
You're sure?
Yeah.
They keep a track,
drop offs, pick-ups.
All right, detective?
Can we leave now?
A cemetery?
That's creepy.
The office is closed tomorrow.
But I could call them.
Maybe I'll come by
with a picture of Paul.
See if anybody knows anything.
All right.
Fuck.
Come on.
I gotta get out of here.
Everything okay?
Yeah. I just got some
business to take care of.
Come on in.
So what did you tell Darcy?
Your text said not to
tell anyone I was coming.
I told him I was...
Had something to do.
Here's your food.
I set a trap, Victor.
I said whoever walks
through that door at 9:00
was going to have
a real bad night.
The person doing
this to me, he's hurt.
Someone who lost someone.
Like the people in the picture.
And he's in a great deal
of pain because of that.
And it's a pain
that I've caused.
Then he kills Paul.
And found he was in both feet.
Victor, I want him
to know something.
I want him to know that
if there's anything left in this
world that he still cares about,
I'm going to find it.
And I'm gonna burn it down.
He's probably wondering right
now what I'm thinking.
What my plan is.
And how much I know.
Wouldn't you be wondering
what I'm thinking?
I would.
You know, you're the only
one I can trust, Victor.
You know why?
No.
Because you saved
my life at Harry's.
It would be something, though.
If you saved my life only
to be the one who kills me.
Have a seat.
I must stand, please.
Shh.
They're outside.
The other day...
You told me that
if I helped you...
Yes!
Believe what I say, my friend.
I don't know, my boss...
He will not know.
You guarantee that?
That I won't be harmed?
I swear to God. Please.
You're asking me these things, so I
know you've been thinking about it.
About me in here.
All right.
Listen to me. You're
in the city. All right?
You're in the basement
of my boss's warehouse.
His name is Alphonse.
Alphonse Hoyt.
I don't know what your brother
or his men did to him,
but they're gonna kill you
whether he pays or not.
I got a camera.
You can record a message for your brother.
I'll make sure he gets it.
We gotta go fast.
Tell him where you are. It's important
you tell him where you are.
I swear to you.
Speak.
Ilir, Ilir, listen...
I'm alive, brother. I don't
know for how much longer.
They're going to kill me. Even if you pay
them the money, they're going to kill me.
They're holding me in a warehouse
that belongs to Alphonse Hoyt.
I beg you. I beg you,
brother, come quickly.
A warehouse that belongs to Alphonse Hoyt...
Alphonse Hoyt!
Thank you. Thank you.
I promise you.
We killed you.
We killed you all!
We killed you all!
I swear on their graves,
you didn't.
I swear! I swear on
their graves, you didn't!
No, no, no! No! No!
No, no, no! No!
Don't let me die like this!
Please! Please!
Don't let me die!
Please have mercy! Please!
Don't let me die like this!
Please!
Yeah.
Yo, I tracked down the manager.
What manager?
I thought it was closed today.
He's gonna be here in 15. Says he
needs to feed some fish or some shit.
I can meet him alone,
if you're busy.
No, no, I'll be there.
All right.
Fuck!
I need to send this package.
But I gotta take care of
something I didn't count on,
so can you send it for me?
Yeah.
What is it?
You don't need to
know what it is.
I need to know what it is.
What is it?
It's a video.
It's one of the Albanians
saying something
I need him to say
to the person I
need him to say it to.
All right?
Okay.
You need to get a tracking number.
With alerts to my cell phone.
Yeah.
All right.
Thanks.
Wait.
Tell your mother
it was very good.
Yeah?
Not too salty?
No.
It was perfect.
Hey, this shit's coming together.
Paul was definitely here.
How'd you know he was here?
The manager.
He asked for this.
It's a list of all
the people buried here.
The guy said he was more interested
in the Hungarian section.
The Hungarian section.
Did he say why?
No.
There's hundreds of them.
Ah.
What happened to that girl?
That girl you told me about
across the way from you.
You ever meet her?
Yeah. I met her.
And?
You didn't die two years ago.
They found the cemetery.
They're getting close.
The one who found
you before got lucky.
And just because
he found the grave
doesn't mean that they will
figure it out as well.
You can walk away, still.
Not too late.
I know why you've
been waiting so long.
Why you haven't killed him.
I think you're afraid
that when it's over,
it won't mend your heart.
You're beautiful.
It was going to waste. I just
felt like putting it on.
I know why you put it on.
Or should I say,
...for whom.
Hey, monster!
Hey!
Get out of here!
Come on!
What... What happened?
I fell and ruined a nice dress.
Let me see.
You Okay?
Yeah.
At least it
wasn't my good side.
I sent your package.
I have your tracking number.
Thank you.
Hello, Victor.
Hello.
Go take off your dress,
it's covered in blood.
He shouldn't see you like this.
Thank you for returning my Tupperware.
Of course.
People usually don't.
Like it comes with the food.
Free Tupperware.
Did you like the food?
Yeah. The food was...
It was very good.
Beatrice didn't tell you?
She was nervous you
wouldn't like her cooking.
I always told her the way to a man's
heart is through his stomach.
One of the ways.
She'll keep you well fed.
That's for sure.
You know, this thing, me
falling and hitting my head?
Maybe it happened because
I lost my rabbit's foot.
The truth is my mom gave it
to me after the accident.
She said it was going to bring
me luck with my procedures.
I picked the color.
Stupid chartreuse.
Hey.
Would you go out
with me tonight?
Somewhere.
Anywhere.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
DARCY:
Laszlo Kerik?
You know the name?
No. No, I don't know him.
I didn't think you would.
I've been searching every dead
Hungarian on this cemetery list.
This shit went down about nine
months before we were on the crew.
There was a case involving
Alphonse and a little girl
who was killed in
one of his buildings.
The case never went to
trial. Get this, right?
The little girl's
mommy and daddy,
they died,
like, two months afterwards.
They're buried
right there next to her.
You there? Vic? Vic?
Yeah. I'm here.
I fucking did it.
I found out exactly what
Paul must have found out.
Look, I want to tell Alphonse. I want
you to be there when I tell him.
No, I'm in the middle of something.
I'll talk to you later.
Oh, Victor.
I didn't know you were coming. I
would have thrown something on.
Maman, you knew very
well he was coming.
No, you didn't
tell me anything.
Well, I told you so.
Ready?
Mmm-hmm.
So...
Where are we going?
You'll see.
A club?
Very cold.
A park?
Are you okay?
Yeah. Good.
This is...
The bar.
In his house,
some credit card receipts.
He usually leaves the bar at 8:30 every night.
But he took a trip.
I want to make sure he's back.
If he's here tonight, he'll
probably be here tomorrow night.
I'm prepared to do it then.
I...
I've found a moment with you.
I want to hang onto it.
It's not gonna end up that way.
I never said it would.
Not with words.
I wore that
white dress for you.
Was that a mistake?
Yes.
All right, wait here.
I'll be back in a minute.
What did you do?
It's done.
It's done.
One, two.
Nope.
Uh-uh.
Hold up. It's this one.
So you're saying
it's someone who knew them?
He must have.
'Cause this guy's dead, right?
Right?
What is it?
The little girl died June 17th.
Two years ago. Right?
Yeah.
June 17th is tomorrow.
Beatrice.
What are you doing?
Oh, my God.
Beatrice!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What?
Yeah, I'm walking
back to him now. Okay.
Yeah.
ALPHONSE: Hey, you know
who this is, right?
Yeah, I know who it is.
I've been getting these weird
letters for the last three months.
With pictures?
With the eyes crossed out?
Whoever is doing it
took my brother.
You remember this problem
I had you take care of for me?
You stayed to the finale.
Right?
And the whole
family took a bow?
Yeah.
And you're sure you saw
the father take a bow?
DARCY ON PHONE: Where the fuck have you been?
I've been trying to call you.
My car won't start.
Some shit's going down, man.
What am I going to tell you?
Come pick me up.
What?
Bring every
fucking gun we have.
Ilir...
Bronzi?
Here?
DARCY: Vic?
You didn't mail the package.
You didn't kill him.
You didn't kill him because
you feel something for me.
You didn't mail the package.
And the guy walked away,
and I called him back.
I called him back, because
I feel something for you.
I could love you.
I don't want you to die.
So I thought that if
I could just mess up
one of your things,
just one thing,
it would be enough so it wouldn't
work out the way you planned.
So I put my rabbit's
foot in that package.
They got my
rabbit's foot instead.
We can run away.
They'd find us.
We keep on running.
We travel by night. I don't
care how far we have to go.
Vic?
Shithole.
Holy shit.
Where are you going?
You come back here!
Laszlo.
Fucking Laszlo.
I'm gonna wait for you here.
Where are you?
I'm outside your apartment.
Come back. Please.
Beatrice, I want you to
go to your apartment now.
Go there now, and stay there
and wait for me. Okay?
Come here!
If you fucking scream, it will go bang.
Okay? Okay.
Laszlo fucking Kerik.
You made me a douche, Laszlo Kerik.
I've seen your artwork.
I've seen your fucking pictures.
You put Paul in the freezer.
This has nothing
to do with you.
I sent you to my
apartment to save you.
All right? You weren't
supposed to go inside.
Yeah, but I did go inside.
I was worried about you.
I don't want to
fucking kill you.
Take this opportunity,
and you let her go.
You lied to me.
You fucking lied to me.
The godfather of my son.
Let her go. Let her go.
You listen to me. You get in
your shitty car that does start.
You start your shitty car. And you
drive your shitty car to Alphonse's.
We'll be waiting.
Fuck.
Get up!
What does it mean?
KILROY: Darcy's here
with the girl.
Hmm.
What happened to your face?
Car accident.
What happened to yours?
You motherfuckers.
Victor.
Alphonse. Don't go anywhere.
Are you coming for me?
No. I'm coming for her.
Yeah, well, she won't be here
when you get here.
Oh, shit.
Take her to my room!
And don't fucking move!
Motherfucker!
He just shot Luco.
No, look! He's
coming up the back stairs.
All right now! I've got
something for your ass!
Follow him, Ilir!
Down the fucking stairs!
Hey, Victor!
Remember I told you if
there was anything left
you still cared about,
I was gonna find it and I was
gonna burn that shit down.
How about this, huh?
You are dead, fuck!
Hey, where the fuck did you go?
What does it mean?
What is he saying?
What the fuck
are you doing, man?
Don't you raise
that fucking gun.
Don't you do it!
Don't you fucking do it!
Bitch, lower the fucking gun!
Did you choose not to kill me
'cause I got a wife and a kid?
No.
I didn't kill you
because they've got you.
