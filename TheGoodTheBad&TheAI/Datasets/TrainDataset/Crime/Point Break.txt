This is it.
This fine trail, we're gonna be
the first ever to complete it.
You're insane, Utah.
There's no way to ride that.
There's a way.
You just gotta trust.
Come on, Jeff. This is
exactly what our sponsors want.
The impossible realized.
And all those YouTube hits.
Anyway, we gotta earn these
bikes we're sittin' on,
and it beats workin' for a livin'.
Yeah, well... While I'm
workin' for a livin',
you'll be suckin' meals through a straw
for the rest of your life.
I like smoothies.
We got this, bro'.
Just follow my line.
Utah to Heli: We're doin' this.
Don't lie baby I
know what you're thinking
Can't hide 'cause
I got that intuition
It's just a matter of
time before we hit the ground
It's just a matter of
time before you lose control
Big eyes Come on,
tell me what you wanna see
Ol' dry little
lady's got a spell on me
It's just a matter of
time before we hit the ground
It's just a matter of
time before you lose control
Whoo-hoo!
Come on, man!
Jeff! Jeff!
Hold on, hold on!
Gas to that gas tank!
- Pull! Come on, pull!

HALL:
When you join the FBI,
you join the front line
Brigham, sir.
My name's Brigham.
Utah's a nickname my
classmates got off YouTube.
That world that you came out of...
Pretty wild, huh?
It had its moments.
Why leave all that
for all this structure?
Maybe I could use some structure, sir.
And maybe there's a part of you
doesn't want anything to do with it.
I know why you left that world.
I know what happened in
that world to that kid.
Jeff, was it?
Yes, sir.
How bad do you really want this?
Bad enough to have gotten
my high school equivalency
at 23, sir.
Bad enough to have gone
to college and law school
five years after my peers had graduated.
Yeah, I saw that.
The Bureau reviewed all my credentials
before they admitted me into this program.
I'm not sure why you're
second-guessing them.
Because it's my job, son,
to only let the most
qualified get past me.
Because I'm not convinced
that you are an FBI agent
I want this.
Well then, show me.
Yes, sir.
HALL:
these perps were very, very smart.
Had a sense of humor, too.
is a majority
American-owned company,
so we, the FBI, are interested.
so the entire month's yield
from the company's mines was on hand.
Their mistake was believing
that nobody could ever rob and
successfully make a getaway
from a sorting facility
And their security
failed to foresee that there might exist
a set of perps with an unusual skill set.
They saw potential police
intervention on the ground,
and they improvised.
They got away with 100 million
- in uncut diamonds...
-
...and then gave it all away
to the poorest of the poor
in the slums of Mumbai.
Who in the world would do that?
This case is right now.
These guys are out there in real time.
What kind of people are
we dealing with here?
Malfunction to ramp override.
Oh, shit!
-
-
Sir, what's going on?
U.S. plane carrying money got hijacked
over San Luis Potosi in Mexico.
Perps jumped out over the jungle
and disappeared without a trace.
We're looking for the bodies.
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a minute?
We have two crimes on
two different continents.
Diamond-sorting facility in Mumbai,
and today's cargo plane over Mexico.
But there's a third crime
on a third continent.
there was an international logging
complex that was burned to the ground
on the banks of the Congo River...
Yeah.
...which is where the world's
most dangerous rapids are.
Now I think the people
that started that fire
also became the first ever to
navigate and survive the Inga Rapids.
You're saying this is
connected to the other two?
I think they're all connected, sir.
Here.
Two days before the Mumbai heist,
only 1,000 miles away,
base-jumping from the peak of Everest.
Same people...
Then what are they really up to here?
I don't know why they're
committing the crimes, sir.
But I have an idea
what they're chasing.
I think they're attempting
something called The Ozaki Eight.
This is Ono Ozaki.
He was an eco-warrior,
one of the first recognized
Extreme Poly-Athletes.
Now he challenged the
Extreme Sports world
of eight ordeals that he said
honored the forces of nature.
Anyone who could find
the perfect line existing
he believed would achieve nirvana.
So this is not about money?
It's about spiritual enlightenment?
Exactly.
An extreme athlete could potentially train
their entire life just to
attempt one of these ordeals.
To complete all eight
would be to complete the impossible.
No one's ever done it.
Ozaki himself died
attempting his third ordeal.
These guys have already
completed the first three.
"Emerging Force" in Africa.
"Birth of Sky" on Everest.
And "Awakening Earth" in Mexico.
What's number four?
It's called "Life of Water."
The National Weather Service
is tracking a low-pressure
system in the Atlantic.
A massive storm about
to hit off the coast
And when it clears, it's
gonna cause a giant swell.
We're talkin'
once-in-a-decade waves.
Eighty feet-plus.
Sir... If I'm right,
that's where they'll be.
You own a suit, son?
-
-
UTAH: Before finding my way
to the FBI, I was what's
called an extreme
sports poly-athlete.
FBI HEAD OF INVESTIGATIONS:
I'm supposed to be on a plane
to Mexico in half an hour.
Why am I listening to this?
Five minutes.
I believe the people behind
the robberies in Mexico
as well as the one in
Mumbai are extreme athletes.
FBI DEPT. DIRECTOR 1: Isn't that obvious?
I don't think you ride a
motorcycle off a building
or skydive out of a
cargo plane if you aren't.
That last pair cratered
somewhere in the jungle.
I don't think they went
into the jungle at all.
Cave of the Swallows.
This is the largest natural
cave shaft on Earth.
The Empire State Building
could literally fit inside it.
adjacent to San Luis Potosi.
The perps knew that.
They surgically identified
the perfect line that would intersect them
with the jungle exactly where they wanted.
In doing so, they became
the first and only
to make a sky-earth transition
into the Cave of Swallows.
FBI DEPT. DIRECTOR 2:
FBI DEPT. DIRECTOR 2: And
what does this have to
out of diamond-sorting facilities?
Or raining U.S. currency
down over central Mexico?
Well, sir, that's what we need to find out.
Those people in there,
But I did.
This is a provisional I.D.
You're on your way to France.
You'll be met there by Agent Pappas
out of the U.K. office.
Now, he's
an acquired taste, but you can trust him.
I want you to do exactly
as he says, you understand?
Yes, sir.
Your job, identify these individuals,
Yes, sir.
Don't let me down, 'cause my
ass is on the line in this.
I don't plan on it, sir.
Surfing? In the middle of the ocean?
Yeah, the storm causes a swell.
It travels thousands of
miles through deep water,
then suddenly reaches an
underwater mountain, and it...
Load your shit. It's time to roll.
So by your, for lack of a
better word, "hypothesis,"
if these guys exist, they'd be out here?
Freak spring swell like this,
there's no way they'd miss it.
No one knows when the next one's gonna hit.
It could be Cortes Bank in a year,
or maybe five, maybe ten.
It's a needle in a haystack after this.
Congrats. You found your haystack.
Whoo-hoo!
Pick up, pick up!
It's all right Ain't
no guard in my house
You ever surf anything like this?
I've surfed.
Yeah, but you ever
surfed anything like this?
Are you ready? Let's go!
Here comes the set of the day!
Ah, shit.
MAN 1: Look! There's two
guys going for the same wave!
MAN 2:
JET SKI DRIVER: What the hell, man?
MAN 2: Back, man! It's not your wave!
MAN 1: That guy, he's snaking the wave!
MAN 3: You're gonna get
somebody killed, man!
MAN 4: What's going on?
-
-
BODHI: So the old
train station in Paris,
- You gonna jump in this time?
-
GROMMET: I'm still
hurting from the last one.
You're the guy I snaked, right?
Yup.
And the one who plucked
you off the ocean floor.
I guess you never surfed anything
that big before, right?
- Has anybody?
- He almost did.
Sorry.
You didn't make the choice for me. I did.
So he's alive? Shame.
Easy, Roach. Don't you
know who our guest is?
Who is it?
Johnny Utah.
"Roach" Rottinger, right?
You're a moto legend, man.
Come on, chill out.
I know who you are.
What's a motocross rider
doing on a wave like that?
You almost got your own
ass killed today, brother.
BODHI: Sort of the point, isn't it?
UTAH: Hey, man, is this your boat?
The only pot I have,
you can't even piss in.
The boat is his.
UTAH:
To be the first to achieve the impossible.
- Hey, man.
- Almost had it, brother.
Almost.
- Next time.
- Next time.
It'll come to me. Right?
Are you enjoying my party?
Hey, that's our guy.
- BODHI:
- MAN:
Good. You, too?
Hey, how come I don't know you?
Big world. Why would you?
Big wave rider like you? I watch YouTube.
I just never seen you.
A tree falls in the forest,
no one puts it on YouTube,
did it ever really happen?
Right.
They call me Bodhi.
You're asking a lot of questions
for someone you don't know.
You and I got something to do. Okay?
Chowder will show you around.
No, I won't.
You're on your own. Enjoy the party.
AL FARIQ: Everyone have a good time!
- Having fun?
- Worst party ever!
Worst party ever? And you're
never gonna get invited again.
- MAN: Thank you very much.
- BODHI: Okay.
It's nice up here.
Samsara.
Johnny.
Nice to meet you.
I saw you on that wave today. It was epic.
I love the sea.
I got a real taste of that today.
- Yeah, I saw you eat shit.
-
Good. Perfect. That's awesome.
Hmm.
Nature will always find a
way to make you feel small.
I owe Bodhi for pullin' me out.
We don't believe in owing.
What do you believe in?
That you choose your path.
You are an FBI agent.
Well, provisional.
I don't care too
much for Valentines
I just need your
skin next to mine
I can see the love
run right out of you
Even if I'm dreaming,
I'm dreaming with you
'Cause I'm a little cold
but I'll warm up with you
-
-
What does "Samsara" mean?
Wanderer.
Can a wanderer have a path?
Yeah, for sure.
But it's only when you stop
looking for one that you find it.
How do I stop looking?
Let's just be here.
Okay.
BODHI: Morning.
Hey.
Had a good time?
It's a good party, man.
What are you doing here, Utah?
What do you mean?
I remember you. Your reputation.
More balls than talent.
Some said maybe that
was why you were so good.
'Cause you lacked fear.
But what I saw on
that wave yesterday,
that was different.
You lacked respect.
There was no connection.
There was no beauty.
Maybe I'm chasing something. Like you are.
Like me?
What do you think I'm chasing?
You're chasing The Eight.
That's a myth.
But the real question is,
what are you after?
That was some crazy, crazy shit.
For that I thank you.
There's gotta be something there, Pappas.
All I saw was the bottom of my glass.
And a great piece of ass. You?
I just know there's gotta be a lotta guys
on that boat who are chasing The Eight.
You got evidence that connects
them to our investigation?
You've got nothing.
I'm takin' you to the airport.
- No.
-
No, I heard some talk
on the boat last night
about something going
down in Paris tonight.
I gotta go check that out.
PAPPAS:
you gotta give me some evidence.
You got it.
- Excuse me. Train station?
-
Thank you.
Psst.
Let him in.
It wouldn't be the first
time he did something stupid.
Small world.
What's he doing here?
I told him to meet us here.
Oh, you did?
Yeah.
He said he was after something.
No better place to find it.
GROMMET: Okay, then.
Welcome.
I just came to catch the scene, man.
You're catchin' it.
Let go.
There you are.
I think I know what I'm after.
You don't know shit.
I'm headed out tonight
to find us a mountain,
and hopefully arrive at the line.
How long you think it'll take?
Maybe a week.
Good luck, brother.
Give me a minute.
It's pretty decent.
There are a few things in
life I don't compromise on.
No, I don't get the impression
you compromise on much ever.
Try not to.
But the world's a pretty messed-up place,
and I still gotta live in it.
So you live off the grid?
No.
We live on it.
Just on our own terms.
What terms?
You wouldn't get it.
We change the grid. We give back.
The second that kid got killed
on your line, you quit life.
You turned away
because of something someone else did.
You were selling sports drinks?
Fine. That's not for me to judge.
But you let someone else determine
the direction your life took.
That I judge.
So you got all your shit figured out,
and screw everyone else for trying, huh?
Is that it?
Ozaki's ordeal.
You doing anything?
We've got nothing.
He'll probably be on
a plane in the morning.
-
- Hang on a minute.
Shit!
Change of plans.
GROMMET: I guess Bodhi
sees something in you.
I don't.
We leave for the Alps first light.
You coming?
How long's the hike?
Depends how fast you are, man.
We still have a long way to go, my friend.
BODHI: That's the summit.
Half a mile of pure primordial rock.
Maybe I should have asked you this before,
but you've done this, right?
Sure.
Except it was out of a plane.
Proximity flight's a
whole different monster.
You need to read the flow.
Become the wind.
Or you'll hit your point.
What point?
The point where you break.
Where fear becomes master,
and you're its slave.
A man who pushes his boundaries
ultimately finds them.
So basically you're sayin' I'm gonna die.
We're all gonna die.
The only question's how.
You wanna keep going, or
are you turning around?
Here he is.
Hey, the rock.
What rock?
You heard the man. Pass the rock.
Oh, you funny assholes!
Should have checked your bag, man.
Always check your bag.
- GROMMET: Ah, great work.
-
- This rock?
- You have another one?
All right.
Ready?
-
-
Six seconds.
Six seconds to fly or die.
When do we go?
First light.
Happening in six days.
So we're gonna jump off a
mountain and reach nirvana?
BODHI:
Ozaki spoke of balance.
But it's not about risking
our lives for personal gain.
It is about becoming part of something
that is much greater than ourselves.
The Eight honors the
essential forces of the Earth.
And Ozaki wanted to complete The Eight
to bring the world's attention back
to the beauty of this planet.
The fact that it is dying.
We have to give more than we take
if we want to stop the destruction
of the very place that gives us life.
That's the path we're on.
That's what we're looking for.
That's what we're following.
We're not here to reach enlightenment,
to find nirvana.
We're here to try to save this place
by becoming one with it.
And to do that, you need
to be able to let go
There's no turning back.
So go whichever way your
heart tells you, Utah.
And if you are on the same path as we are,
I may see you at dawn.
Are you ready to let go?
Let's do this.
You did it!
Whoo-hoo!
Congratulations.
Thanks, man.
- Yeah!
-
GROMMET: That's how you do it.
ALL: Yeah! Yeah!
Whoo!
- BODHI: You guys ready?
- SAMSARA: Oh, yeah.
- Here you go.
- Let me see.
Ah.
- It's a little dry.
- BODHI: Tastes good.
- All right?
- SAMSARA: Yeah.
Ready?
Welcome, Johnny.
Thank you.
Let's eat.
- Yeah. Whoo.
- Okay.
UTAH: My mom was a Ute Indian.
That's why they call me Utah.
Means "mountain people."
Maybe that's why I was
so good on the slopes.
Jeff was like a brother
to me. More than a friend.
And he died because of me.
What happened to your friend was tragic.
But it was his choice, not yours.
We can only be responsible
for our own path, brother.
And let others have theirs.
BODHI: "Life of Ice."
The Sixth Ordeal.
Chowder found the mountain
in Italy, but not the line.
You gotta find a line,
you gotta do it fast.
Weather's rolling in. You don't wanna get
caught up here when it does.
If this rock's even rideable.
What about that one over there?
Definitely first descent.
- No.
- ROACH:
Not radical enough for you?
It's radical enough.
Then what's wrong with it?
It's not beautiful.
That's not beautiful. That's death.
Maybe. But it's also perfect.
-
- Shit...
- Let's do this.
- Right.
I got you. I'll be with the chopper.
That's it. We're done. We're cliffed out.
Grommet? Send the chopper. It's over.
-
- GROMMET:
Screw that.
This guy is seriously broke.
Kind of great, isn't it?
We're never gonna finish what we started
if we die on this mountain.
We have to do this.
GROMMET ON RADIO:
Oh, man.
He's up there! We gotta find him!
He's dead! You can't help
it! It's not about you!
Are you crazy? That was my line!
Your line?
The second he committed
to it, it became his line!
Not yours.
Let it go.
See you soon, brother.
See you soon.
ROACH:
ALL: To Chowder!
-
- WOMAN: Whoo!
Oh, shit! It's Utah!
- Utah! Utah, man!
- What's up, man?
Where did you come from?
I've been on Mars, man. I've been on Mars.
Peace, peace. Hey, bro'.
Man, check out what my
boys were doing in Mumbai.
Good to see you, man.
MAN: In Mumbai? The three parachutes?
- I know, I know. I gotta go...
- WOMAN: Don't go!
I'll be back in one minute.
I'll be back, just wait. One minute!
AL FARIQ:
Hey, it's my pleasure to have you here.
You are always welcome chez Al Fariq.
I like you, Johnny.
I want you on my team, man!
Daredevil dreams come true.
I can make you a hero,
or I can watch you die trying.
Look at that asshole.
He's got more money
than most small nations.
AL FARIQ:
You all right?
Lifted up his leg and
pissed out this atrocity
all over the mountains.
Whoo!
You know, he doesn't own these mountains,
just like he doesn't own us.
AL FARIQ:
Cake, cake, cake! Come on!
You good?
Yeah.
Man, I see a lot of taking
on the way to enlightenment.
What's being given back?
Trust me.
We give back.
Do you need privacy?
No. I'm good.
Everybody leave?
Yeah, mostly.
Are you okay?
I don't know.
Thinkin' about losing Chowder.
If any of this party is
what Ozaki had in mind
for the path to enlightenment.
Ozaki would have hated this.
He only cared about the purity of The Eight
and giving back whatever
he took from the Earth
on the way to getting there.
And what did he give back?
Sometimes it was as
simple as planting a tree.
Other times it was something much larger.
Like when my parents died in an avalanche
when I was nine,
he gave me a home.
I didn't know.
Sorry.
I know that he died
questing his third ordeal.
Yeah. That's the story.
But it's not the truth.
He completed that ordeal.
He could have finished the entire eight.
He was that good.
But instead he got himself killed
giving back for that ordeal.
How?
He positioned his small
boat in the north Atlantic
between a Norwegian whaling ship
and a pod of humpback whales.
The whaling ship never even slowed.
a young guy who was on the boat with him.
Well, why didn't this
young guy say something?
Why didn't he tell the world?
Maybe he had other ideas.
It wouldn't have made a difference anyway.
As much as I worshipped Ozaki,
that was his Achilles' heel.
He truly believed that
he could change the world with an idea.
Ideas can be powerful.
Not as powerful as a whaling ship.
If not ideas, then what else is there?
Action.
That young guy on the boat.
That was Bodhi, wasn't it?
Bodhi is going to complete
what Ozaki set out to do.
He's going to take a
different path to do it.
So here we are.
Came as fast as I could.
PAPPAS: Yeah. It's been 12 days.
I saw an opportunity.
I couldn't break cover.
I put a 24-hour surveillance
on Al Fariq's hideaway.
I know exactly what you were doing.
Criminal masterminds?
They're just kids partying away their lives
on Al Fariq's dime.
The difference between them and you
is you're doing it on the FBI's.
Pappas...
Where does that leave you, huh?
Hangin' out on this dock
while I'm onto something?
You're onto shit!
Now I'm sorry if this particular locale
lacks the glamour you're accustomed to
because there's no drugs
or naked girls shakin' their arses.
But that's why we stayed
down 'ere all night.
To prove that wasn't
an American mine
that blew that piece of shit up!
For your information, this
is how the real FBI works.
It's dirty, it's pedestrian,
and generally downright boring!
I can figure this out, Pappas!
I just need more time.
ROACH: You've been gone a day.
Where the fuck have you been?
BODHI: Ready to start
talkin' about giving back?
BODHI: She gives.
We partake.
And then we give her an offering.
UTAH: An offering of what?
BODHI:
has been ripping gold out of
her guts for over 20 years.
We're gonna get some
of it back for her.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, my man.
Source to source.
You're gonna steal it?
No.
We're going to liberate it.
When's this goin' down?
Right now, brother.
I get it, okay? People
are screwing up the world.
And you wanna do something about it,
then you gotta find another way!
The world is burning! Look around!
- Do you have a better idea?
- There's about a hundred ways
this could go really wrong, man.
Explosives like that...
You're gonna cross a line
you can't come back from.
That's the difference between us.
We see the truth.
BODHI:
MAN: No, no!
- GROMMET:
- ROACH:
- GROMMET:
- ROACH:
-
- GROMMET:
ROACH:
Come on, Johnny!
All set.
Get out! Get out! Get out of there!
Help me! Gimme a hand! Help me!
Bodhi, freeze, FBI!
I can't let you do it, brother!
Damn it, Bodhi, drop that!
That's it. We gotta get
outta here! Let's go!
UTAH: It was you the whole time!
Mumbai, Africa, Mexico... Everything!
BODHI: If you really wanted to know,
all you had to do was ask.
When you showed up in Paris,
we knew you were a cop.
Then why'd you let me in?
Because I thought I could save you.
That's when I lost
control of the motorcycle
and crashed into the river.
By the time I got back to
the surface and the riverbank,
he was gone.
Your orders were to investigate and report.
So now I got another situation.
$100 million in gold ore
lost from Grauman Minerals,
which as you know, is
another multi-national
with American ties.
And I got the Director on my ass
sending me here from D.C. to end this.
So my question...
Why did you not follow
your instructions, son?
I'd earned their trust,
sir, and I wanted to be sure
they were the suspects.
So your m.o. is to help
them commit another crime?
No! Not at all. I wanted to stop them.
- Yeah...
- I tried to stop them.
Bodhi doesn't see these as crimes.
He thinks of them as offerings.
Offerings? What the hell does that mean?
What the hell does that even mean?
These guys are trying to
complete the Ozaki Eight.
They see that as a gift
given to them from the Earth.
To balance out that gift,
they want to give back
something taken from the Earth.
This case, it was gold ore
that was ripped out of the ground.
Now you've been
undercover, what, two weeks?
You know how easy it is
to lose perspective, son?
What happened here, you got too close
to these individuals.
You did exactly what I told you not to do!
I wanna catch these
guys, sir. Just like you.
They just don't see
themselves that way.
They've taken Ozaki's
ideas to the extreme.
They think they're crusaders
with a worthy cause.
They're more than willing to die for it.
Every criminal has some
bullshit justification
for what they do.
And just like every other
identified criminal,
their profiles are here at Interpol.
They will make a move,
and we will catch them.
UTAH: These guys are meticulous.
Everything they do is near flawless.
And it will get ugly.
Ugly is what we do, son.
- Sir?
- Yes?
I think you should see this.
Coming through frame any second...
-
- UTAH:
Bodhi's gonna finish what
Ozaki started, no matter what.
We've frozen their assets.
They can't do a damn thing.
Hugh, how many banks are in the area?
There's more than a dozen.
Except a small branch
on top of the mountain.
But no one would be crazy
enough to try anything there.
These guys would be.
It's on top of a mountain.
Only one road, up or
down. A total chokepoint.
Chokepoint is exactly what they want.
Alert local law enforcement.
It's time to choose whose side you're on.
I'm not officially doin' this.
I don't want you dyin'
on my watch, so don't.

Bodhi!
No! Hold your fire!
Ahh!
Move!
Cut 'im off!
UTAH:
Bodhi, no! No!

That's one hell of a bucket list.
PAPPAS: Why isn't
number four crossed off?
I thought he surfed the wave.
He chose to save my life instead.
Yeah.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Thought he said it was
gonna be an easy job.
Oh, God...
I know where he's goin'.
The first six ordeals all travel
in one direction, down.
But Seven, "Master of Six Lives,"
asks you to go against gravity, go up.
Free solo rock climbing.
And no ropes, no protection,
no second chances.
Now, there are just a handful
of ascents in the world
that match Ozaki's
standard for the impossible,
but only one that lies outside
of the reach of the U.S. government...
Angel Falls, Venezuela.
It's also the country
that Bodhi was born in.
Very smart.
Excuse me, sir. There is a call for you.
I'll call him back.
We have no diplomatic
relationships with Venezuela.
We have no extradition
treaty with Venezuela.
We get this son-of-a-bitch
when he pops up next.
If he survives this next ordeal,
he's got two left, correct?
That's right, sir.
But the wave like the one
off France is incredibly rare.
there's a swell that size again.
And the 8th Ordeal,
"Act of Ultimate Trust,"
is a mystery.
I need to get to Bodhi
in the 7th Ordeal before
he starts to climb.
Otherwise he is gone.
We can't even get into the country.
I will not let this go, sir.
Do you understand? He's out of reach.
I make mistakes. Now, I know that.
But I promised you I could do this job.
I need to finish it.
Pap,
can we get him in?
Yeah, it could be done.
Hey. This it?
Try not to get yourself killed, kid.
GROMMET: Bodhi, I can't see the line.
Nothing.
I do.
I do see it, and it's beautiful.
You know I always trusted you, right?
To follow a line I can't even see?
It's not my line. It's yours.
UTAH:
It's over!
GROMMET: Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
Come on!
You can get it! Go for it!
You can do it.
BODHI: Hey, Grommet, come on.
See you soon.
You've got nowhere to go!
UTAH: Do you have any idea
how many laws you've broken?
And you accomplished nothing.
Maybe.
But I'm not done yet.
Bodhi! No!
No!
No gear, no shoes, no body, nothin'.
Probably miles downriver by now.
Might never find the body.
"The Act of Ultimate Trust:"
Bodhi went over the falls on purpose.
"The 8th Ordeal."
He figured it out.
Had it fast-tracked.
I guess this is a really
small world, isn't it?
I just knew if you were
alive anywhere on the Earth,
there's no way you'd let this go.
"Life of Water."
It's the last ordeal you
need to complete The Eight.
Why are you here, Utah?
It's 100-foot out there. More.
You got no PFD.
You're 150 miles from shore.
I'm here to take you in
because if you go out there,
you're not comin' back, Bodhi!
And isn't that beautiful?
Isn't that beautiful?
Isn't that beautiful, brother?
This is my path.
Let me complete it.
See you soon, Utah.
PILOT:
Home.
