Buck Rogers, now adventuring in the
amazing world of the 20th century.
By turning the dial
to project us ahead in time...
...we're able to be with Buck and friends
in the wonderful world of the future.
A world that sees a lot of our scientific
and mechanical dreams come true.
You know, there's nothing supernatural
or mystic about Buck.
He's just an ordinary, normal human
being who keeps his wits about him.
MAN 1: What's wrong?
MAN 2: Nothing really.
I just feel that I need
something stronger.
MAN 1: If you have a problem,
don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
MAN 2: Yes, thank you, I'll be all right.

Never mind.
Never mind.
Never mind. Never mind.
MAN 3:
Can you feel this?
What is that? Nausea?
Are you now?
Or have you ever been?
Move slowly.
COMPUTER 1:
Hello, is somebody else there?
COMPUTER 2:
THX, this is inner control.
You're off .017 to the right.
Correct it, please.
Make the correction, THX.
COMPUTER 3: All right. Just back off,

THX: I need something stronger.
MAN:
Take four red capsules.
In 10 minutes, take two more.
Help is on the way.
WOMAN: What's wrong?
COMPUTER: Take a visual record of this.
We found it in the patching cells.
We killed it.
WOMAN:
Thank you for being conscientious.
A visual record is being taken...
...and filed with the Department
of Biological Flow. You have...
MAN 1:...now out of service

MAN 2:...shall, in any consequence
of any law or regulation...

We are sorry.

All right,
make the appropriate correction.
COMPUTER 2:
That's it.
COMPUTER 1: Check the grid line.

All right, watch it. You're gonna
override again. Bring it down.
You're right next to it.
COMPUTER 3: Right.
WOMAN: What's wrong?
MAN 1: I bought one of these yesterday
and it doesn't fit my consumer...
...and the store doesn't have
the other kind.
MAN 2: For more enjoyment
and greater efficiency...
...consumption is being standardized.
- We are sorry.
MAN 3: This is...
COMPUTER 1: Attention all stations,
I have a temporary blockage...

MAN 2: Comperson and penderal...
CHILD: What's wrong, Papa?

We are sorry...
MAN 3:

It should be on your DTO screen now.

in Red Sector L14.
Do not abandon your post.
There is no danger of radiation leakage.
MAN 1: Repeat, there has been
an accident in Red Sector L14.
Do not abandon your post.
There is no danger of radiation leakage.

That accident over in Red Sector L...

Keep up the good work

My time is yours.
- Masses for the masses.
- Go ahead.
One for all. All is one.
Masses are what we are.
We are the masses.
But all in all, we are masses.
For the Party and for all,
masses are what we are.
Very good. Proceed.
Well...
...I slipped...
...on a thermal transfer this morning.
It's never happened before.
I wasn't concentrating enough.
Yes, I understand.
Things haven't been...
- ...going well.
- Yes, fine.
How could I be so wrong?
My mate...
...has been acting very strange.
I can't explain it.
- Yes.
- I haven't been feeling very well myself.
- Yes, I understand.
- I don't know, maybe it's me.
Yes, fine.
I needed some pinural last night.
- I feel as if something...
- Excellent.
...odd were happening to me.
- Something that...
- Yes?
- ...I can't understand.
- Could you be more...
...specific?
The sedatives.
I'm taking etracene,
but it doesn't seem strong enough.
I have a hard time concentrating.
You are a true believer.
Blessings of the state.
- Please, forgive me.
- Blessings of the masses.
Thou art a subject of the divine,
created in the image of man...
...by the masses, for the masses.
Let us be thankful
we have an occupation to fill.
Work hard.
Increase production.
Prevent accidents.
And...
...be happy.
ROBOT: If it will make you happy,
just this once.
Now, be careful, it's heavy.
THX?
THX?
LUH:
THX?
Is that you?
WOMAN: We are sorry,
but we must deny your request.
Birthborns are not allowed
more than 5 units of enerval.
Substitution of enerval for etracene...
...may cause
a serious chemical imbalance.
Thank you.
Never before have we been
so contented. Never.
MAN:
A dragon sounds like this when...
...nine units of detuned escalatories
have not, however...
...prevented virus and ordnance
from invading our centers.
The three recently elected representatives
from Con 9 have again resigned...
- ...and returned to their sectors.
- You ought to eat.
Five felons were caught fleeing
rehabilitation center DD2.
All five have been undergoing treatment
for drug offenses.
- Where did you get this car?
- I was just issued it.
I took it for a test drive and ran straight
through a crowd at the dispersal center.
MANNEQUIN 1:
Oh, terrible. Terrible.
MANNEQUIN 2:
No. No, it was wonderful.
Because I didn't hit anyone,
just an 1114.
What's this? Why did you change it?
- You've seen enough.
MANNEQUIN 2: That's wonderful.
MANNEQUIN 1: It's terrible.
- You know I don't feel well.
- Take your sedation.
MANNEQUIN 1: That is just terrible.
MANNEQUIN 2:
No, it was wonderful, wonderful.
Because my hand,
it was paralyzed anyway.
THX:
That was very funny.
WOMAN OVER SPEAKER:
An enerval overdose...
...may cause
a serious chemical imbalance.
COMPUTER:
My time is yours.
Go ahead.
What's wrong with me?
What am I to her or she to me?
Nothing.
- Yes, fine.
- She's an ordinary roommate.
I share rooms with her.
- Our relationship is normal, conforming.
- Excellent.
We share nothing...
...but space.
What is she doing to me?
Yes, I understand.
I think I'm dying.
Could you be more...
...specific?
COMPUTER:
You are a true believer.
Blessings of the state.
Blessings of the masses.

LUH: Never mind.
LUH:
I was so afraid.
So alone.
I wanted to touch you...
...so many times.
THX:
I was happy.
Why get me involved?
LUH:
They know.
They've been watching us.
I can feel it.
No one knows.
They're watching us now.
No one can see us.

MAN 2: All right, just a minute.
Standby, scope 1.
If you go back on sedation,
you won't feel the same way about me.
You'll report me for drug violation.
I've got a slip movement to install
on my next shift.
I'll never make it the way I am now.
I wouldn't turn you in, not now.
- You don't...
- I know I wouldn't.
You can do it without etracene.
- You can. I know you can.
- Then what?
It can't go on forever, you know it can't.
We could leave.
And live in the superstructure.
You only have one more shift left,
don't you?
We could be gone
before the next series started.
THX:
It's all right.
It's all right.
COMPUTER:
Standing by.
THX:
What's this?
LUH:
I have to see SEN.
I've just been given a shift change.
- When?
- Now.
- Now?
- He wants me to come to his quarters.
A shift change should come
through scheduling.
Why should he want to see you?
LUH:
I don't know.
- Don't go.
- I have to. He's a G34.
You don't have to.
I don't trust him.
You ought to file a report.
No.
Don't make trouble.
It's nothing.
Then why did you bring it up?
I didn't.
You asked me about the card.
You're going to get us
into trouble.
MAN OVER SPEAKER:
Do not push at the fountain.
It's more work for the cleaning detail.
COMPUTER 1: Did you copy that?
COMPUTER 2: The hung-over writing.
Is he getting that?
Is he copying me?
COMPUTER 3:
This is borough-flow submaster.
Control, have you got that code?
COMPUTER 2: I read you very badly.
I'll check the message...
MAN:...hunter portapods.
SEN: It's you.
WOMAN: Twenty-three hunter portapods.
SEN: Come in. Sit down.
You know, this is really odd.
I was just thinking about you.
I must apologize for all this chaos.
They moved in this morning...
...and it's been going on all day.
The roommate was destroyed,
you know.
Terrible inconvenience.
Have to try to see things in perspective,
do what you can...
...to make things...
...fit.
I can accept things up to a point.
But if you get a chance...
...to make...
...adjustments...
...you're very foolish to pass them up.
Where is LUH?
- What?
WOMAN: Your card, please.
Thank you.
MAN OVER SPEAKER:
This monitor is to be used...
...for emergencies
or special requests only.
All routine information
can easily be obtained...
...through the bulletin panels
installed at...
Why did you have LUH come here?
Why are you so concerned?
What's going on?
I want you for my roommate.
We'll be very good for one another.
I don't understand. Living...
Living selection is computed.
I know what you're thinking.
Program-shifting isn't
that major a crime, is it?
You're in violation.
Don't say that.
What have you done to LUH?
She was here.
We...
...had a long talk.
And she agreed that it would be better
for both of you to switch.
She seemed to think that
you weren't accurately mated...
...with her in the first place.
I'll never have another mate like ONA.
You rate very high in sanitation.
I've checked.
THX:
I don't feel well.
We'll be happy.
MAN OVER TV: With the economic
advantages of the mating structure...
...it far surpasses any disadvantages
in increased perversions.
A final trans...
MAN: An infinite translated mathematics

...among artificial memory devices

Stimulating rhetoric.
THX:
LUH?
MAN:
Absolute.
The theater of noise is proof
of our potential.
The circulation of prototypes.
The golden talisman underfoot
is phenomenon approaching.
And in the history of now...
...all ethos are designed.
Why are you here?
You're not cleared for this area.
You know I have a way with computers.
I can program myself for any area, almost.
THX:
I'll report you.
SEN: Listen, no need to be
distressed with me.
THX: Get out of here, leave me alone.
- I've taken care of LUH.
I programmed her to area 5450.
The transfer should come through
by the next series.
You're gonna need a new roommate.

WOMAN: Control center 626

If society is to free itself

We must exterminate the source of sin.
Economics must not dictate situations

You could just open them up as if...
Open all four up.
MAN 2: Yeah. You ought to be careful
about the...
You got any polarity here

MAN 1: What...?
- I just punched up one and I'm opening...
...imagine that that has something to do
with the results the 378 was getting.
That's it. Okay, now watch
that reading. And as it...
- Watch the needle on 5, now. Watch...
MAN 2: This... This knob is loose.
Wait, which switch gets it out?
MAN 1: Master at the bottom.
Okay, there we are.
What is the real dope
on the cortex bond problem, anyway?
MAN 2:
Oh, you find yourself with...
MAN 1: Don't let it get above 4.8.
Look at this.
MAN 2: Little monkey.
- I cut myself.
What if you put a dual display on it
and I punch two up?
MAN 2:
Yes, you can see two at once.
When you see three, punch a third.
The numbers read...
Yeah. So it's best to go back to two.
And really, to get an accurate reading...
MAN 1: I don't see any dissolution here.
MAN 2: You haven't...
Don't let it get above 4.7.
MAN 1: Here, I'll bring these back down

Yes, but dissolution occurred at 4.5.

Oh, yeah?

MAN OVER SPEAKER:
THX 1138.
SEN:
Hi.
I know you turned me in.
I'm doing quite well here anyway.
I'm setting some things up...
...but it isn't easy.
A very difficult balance, you know?
Listen. Now, let's get something straight
right from the start.
It's gonna take you some time
to see my overall plans.
So until then, stay out of things
you don't understand, right?
You're gonna be making things
more difficult for me.
It's the least you can do. Huh?
What's wrong with you?
- Don't be like that.
- It's all right. You're safe now.
SEN:
When posterity judges our actions here...
...it will perhaps see us
not as unwilling prisoners...
...but as men who,
for whatever reason...
...preferred to remain as non-contributing
individuals on the edge of society.
- We must not let this happen.
MAN 1: Countless diversions.
SEN: Gentlemen, the choice is there.
- Reciting where we are.
- Arguing about leaving.
SEN: Make no mistake.
- Predicting the future. Ridiculous.
SEN: We must choose a leader...
MAN 1: What about keeping it livable?
- ...to unite us together.
GUARD: LUH 9998.
- LUH?
PTO: Uh...
MAN 2: What happened? Who's gone?
MAN 3: JOT.
- My friend, your point of view...
...yes, CAM, that's it.
Your point is well taken, CAM...
...but it lacks the balance
that a broader...
...and deeper range
of experience can lend it.
When I first arrived here,
I saw things as perhaps you do now.
Yes, I was confused
about my predicament.
I longed to thrash out, to tear down,
to destroy and annihilate...
...to ravage, wreak havoc and plunder.
Being basically levelheaded, however...
...I realized that my first goal
should be to study this place...
...where what seemed
blind circumstance had placed me.
Listen to the mumblings of an old man...
...and bank those flames with earnest
inquiry and honest observation.
SEN:
"Mumblings."
"Mumblings," you hear? Know how many
times we listened to that speech?
Do you know how many times
we've had to listen to that speech?
Thinks we're as blind as him.
Know what you are?
You make me sick.
If we thought like you...
You know what I want?
I want ideas. I want one idea.
One idea could get us out of here!
SEN: We'll have to be sure
it's the right idea.
We'll know it when we see it.
I'll know it when I see it!
Clear and straightforward
and plain as the nose on your face.
Talked to oneself over...
PTO:...believed he was going
to a place where he'd be happy.
And in so believing, he created a
veritable paradise for himself right here.
Unfortunately, not all of us can have
the positive conviction of LOO.
But thankfully, not all of us are burdened
with the ominous forebodings of SEN.
I, myself...
MAN 2: That's what I mean by the
wrong idea.
Look, I'm not going to try to prove
the usefulness of history.
It is genuinely too obvious
to need proof.
I want to help you.
You can help me.
Here.
Take a biscuit.
You understand,
we're all in this together.
You want to leave. You're not like them.
A secret that we all get out of here...
SEN: Take it easy! Look at them.
It's pathetic. It's pitiful.
They've even begun to go into
my corner and look for things.
My things.
You're with me.
I know.
I have a contract.
All it says is:
"You're with me."
We're all in this together.
We must convince the others.
Later, then.
SEN:
We need a new unity.
And not a unity
which discourages dissent.
We need dissent,
but we need a creative dissent.
Our voices are not raised
in any harmonious chorus...
...but our differences are differences
of emphasis rather than of fundamentals.
- Tomorrow, as we...
ROBOT: Nondescript 6431399.
- What is it?
- A shell dweller.
They live in the outer shell. Quite unique.
There have been two here before
and they smell.
MAN 4:
What do you know?
Come here, my friend.
Let me touch you.
What'd he just do?
What's wrong, huh?
Your lunch is dirty. What a waste.
Here, we can save some of it.
It's all right.
Everything's fine.
What?
Well, if you didn't want it,
why'd you take it?
I thought this was all settled. Hm?
- Where you going?
- I'm leaving.
SEN: Leaving? Leaving what?
You can't leave.
You can't go. Hey, wait.
Oh, I know, the smell. Yeah, it's terrible.
It's a little bit...
Hey, you can't...
You can't leave without...
Just a minute.
Wait. Just wait there a minute.
After long deliberation,
I have decided to go out...
...and personally examine the barrier...
...to learn firsthand
what difficulties are involved...
...and decide how to overcome them.
I recognize an element of risk...
...but moments such as these require
a choice be made and action taken...
...regardless of the danger.
We'll be back soon...
...but we'll be gone long enough to form
an accurate and functional escape.
And I shall have an honest idea how best
to organize us into a working unit.
- The new alignment.
- Incredible.
Wait. Wait. Hey, wait for me.
Just the thing to put them on their feet.
Show them who the leaders are.
When we get back, they'll be right there,
right in the palm of my hand.
There's no question.
Even old PTO would be with us...
...if he'd still been advised.
How far before they can't
see us anymore, huh?
Maybe we better sit down right here.
Hey, rest for a while.
I can't...
I can't see them anymore.
LUH.
You're going after LUH, aren't you?
Why, it's ridiculous.
Going after...
Oh, wait, I knew there was something
I had to tell you.
Uh, LUH, you know, the other,
the new LUH?
He told me he'd seen her. He saw
her just before he came out here.
- She's gonna be coming out here.
- How was she?
Oh, very well. Very good health.
Just exactly the way...
- You're lying.
- No, I am not.
The air's getting thinner.
Or pressure's getting greater.
It's the pressure.
How do you feel?
Shouldn't be this far.
There's no air.
I haven't got the time.
You can stay here if you like.
I'll come with you.
SEN:
What?
THX:
Look.
SEN:
What?
That's a man.
It's a man. He's waving.
He's waving to us.

Uh, where'd you guys come from?
Oh, well, it doesn't make any difference.
Is that food?
I'm starving. Do you mind?
How did you get here?
I mean, I was lost.
- You're not lost now?
- Uh-uh.
- Know the way out?
- Uh-huh.
- That's the way out.
- That's the way we came.
Yeah, but maybe you traveled in circles.
That's the way out.
How do you know?
Well, look.
Look more closely. You see?
Come on.
SEN:
Oh, yeah.
SEN:
Nothing stopped us.

COMPUTER 2:
...intercerebral process reported earlier.
SRT: How shall the new environment
be programmed?
SRT:
It all happened so slowly that...
...most men failed to realize
that anything had happened at all.
I wonder what happened to SEN.
We'll never make it through
that main way.
- Who are you?
- I'm a hologram.
I'm not real. You know,
the fantasy bureau...
...electrically-generated realities
and all that.
I was stuck in the same circuit
for too long.
The arm and leg routine,
did you see that one?
I always wanted to be part
of the real world.
So I left.
Hey, look.
MAN OVER SPEAKER: You are engaged

MAN OVER SPEAKER:
This is Budget Control.
The expenditure ceiling
on the THX case is 14,000 credits.
Remember, thrifty thinkers
are always under budget.
Would you like part of this?
It's not very much.
SRT: Did you know all the insides
are gone from all these people?
MAN:
Halt.
MAN OVER SPEAKER: Economics make it
necessary to terminate any operation...
...which exceeds 5 percent
of its primary budget.
COMPUTER:

Things don't seem to make sense.
Sometimes I see things get left out...
...and they don't fit.
People don't seem to see them.
Or they don't know what to do.
Sometimes I...
Sometimes little...
A little adjustment...
...can make all the difference.
I wanna do the right thing.
I wanna go back.
I... I...
I can... I can start again.
I can change.
I can... I can help.
I just need a...
Need to rest up for a little while.
MONK:
This is no place for prayer.
If you want to speak to OMM, you must
go to a unichapel, you know that.
SEN: Yeah.
- What?
- Are you in any trouble?
SEN: No. I'm okay. I'm going now.
What's your number and your prefix?
I'm gonna see this gets into your report.
No, I'm leaving now.
I'm sorry, I have to report all intruders.

SEN: I lost it.
MONK: You're in violation.
I'll have to report you to authorities.
SEN: No, it's not my time.
Please, just...
THX:
Trapped.
SRT:
Trapped.
SRT: Looks like the only way out
is the way we came in.
Say, do you have any more
of that food? I'm hungry.
She's not there.
Who are you looking for?
ROBOT: Can you hear me? Stay calm.
Everything will be all right.
The door seems to be jammed.
Please check the lock on your side.
Everything will be all right.
We are here to help you.
Stay calm.
We are not going to harm you.
Everything will be all right.

has made a mistake...
...that's your roommate.
No. No, you're wrong.
ROBOT 1:
I hope that auxiliary load holds.
ROBOT 2: I'm almost through
to the upper positive plates.
Upper positive plates?
Maybe you are right. Maybe there's
something wrong with the computer.
I don't know. It's a strange life.
Cybernetics, genetics, lasers
and all those things.
I guess I'll never understand
any of that stuff.
Guess maybe holograms
are not supposed to.
COMPUTER: THX 1138
will be taken into custody...
...at a minimal monetary expenditure.
Total operation cost:
