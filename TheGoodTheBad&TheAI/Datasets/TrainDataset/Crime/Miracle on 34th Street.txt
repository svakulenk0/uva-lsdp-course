You've got them mixed up.
You're making a mistake.
You're making a mistake
with the reindeer.
Tsk tsk tsk.
Would you mind stepping out
for a moment?
Open the door!
I'm sorry.
The store isn't open today.
I don't want
to buy anything...
and I'm sorry
to interrupt your work...
but I wanted to tell you
you're making a serious mistake.
- Huh?
- With the reindeer, I mean.
You've got Cupid
where Blitzen should be.
And Dasher should be
on my right-hand side.
He should, huh?
Yes. And another thing...
Donner's antlers have got
four points instead of three.
Still, I don't suppose anybody
would notice except myself.
No. I don't suppose so.
- Well, bye. Thanks.
- Not at all.
Glad to have helped you. Bye.
Yes.
Jingle bells,
jingle bells...
You're on float number three.
You're on the Pilgrim float.
You're on the pirate float.
You follow the van.
Mrs. Walker,
something's got to be done.
That three-men-in-a-tub float
isn't big enough.
We can get
the butcher and the baker...
I'm awfully sorry...
but I've got enough to do
to take care of the people.
I was hoping you could... George!
I beg your pardon, sir.
You seem to have got mixed up
with this whip of yours.
Allow me, will you?
It's quite simple, really.
- You don't mind if I show you?
- No, sir.
Now, then.
- See? It's all in the wrist.
- Is that so?
Yes, of course.
If you follow through.
Is that so?
It's just like
throwing a ball.
If you were to...
You've been drinking.
Well, it's cold.
A man's got to do something
to keep warm.
You ought
to be ashamed of yourself.
Don't you realize there are
thousands of children...
lining the streets
waiting to see you...
children who have been dreaming
of this moment for weeks?
You're a disgrace to
the tradition of Christmas...
and I refuse to have you
malign me in this fashion.
Disgusting.
Tell me, who's in charge
of this parade?
When you find out, tell me.
These pants are gonna fall off
in Columbus Circle.
I beg your pardon.
Who's in charge here?
Mrs. Walker.
There she is, down there.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
You two ought to be
over on 81st Street.
Mrs. Walker,
one of the men in your parade...
What are you doing
out of costume?
Get back and get dressed...
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I thought
you were our Santa Claus.
Your Santa Claus
is intoxicated.
- Oh, no!
- Yes. It's disgraceful.
How can you allow a man
to get into such a position?
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Stop that!
What do you mean by drinking?
You know it's not allowed.
A man's got to do
something to keep warm.
I'll warm you.
I ought to take this cane...
Somebody, Julian,
get some black coffee...
plenty of it, too.
Yes, Mrs. Walker.
Black with a little cream.
Wake me up
when the parade starts.
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Shameful! Absolutely shameful!
Could you be Santa Claus?
Have you had any experience?
Oh, a little.
Oh, please.
You've got to help me out.
I am not in the habit
of substituting...
for spurious Santa Clauses.
- Oh, please.
- No, I...
Well, the children
mustn't be disappointed.
All right, I'll do it.
Oh, good. Thank you.
Come right this way.
Get that costume.
Wonderful!
He's the best we've ever had...
and he didn't need any padding.
What?
He didn't need padding.
Where did you find him?
I just turned round,
and there he was.
I'm glad you turned round.
Just think if Mr. Macy
had seen the other one!
Just think if Mr. Gimbel
had seen the other one.
You want to ride
in the motorcycle or a car?
No. I'm going home
and get in a hot tub...
and I might stay there
until next Thanksgiving.
You should see it.
You worked so hard.
If I want to, which I doubt...
I can see it from
the roof of my apartment.
That's right,
you live down the...
Mrs. Walker!
Susan!
Susan?
- Hello, Cleo.
- Hello, Mrs. Walker.
What a beauty.
Where's Susan?
She's watching the parade.
Where? With whom?
With that Mr. Gailey
in the front apartment.
Oh, yes.
I've been keeping
an eye on her.
She can see everything
from there.
That's the 50 yard line.
He's so very fond of Susan.
When he asked me,
I didn't think you'd mind.
Well, I guess it's all right.
I'll go on in a minute.
Looks like they're
having a little trouble...
with the baseball player.
He was a clown last year.
They just changed the head
and painted him different.
My mother told me.
He certainly is a giant,
isn't he?
Not really.
There are no giants, Mr. Gailey.
Maybe not now, Suzie...
but in olden days,
there were a lot of...
What about the giant
that Jack killed?
Jack? Jack who?
Jack...
Jack!
"Jack and the Beanstalk."
I never heard of that.
You must've heard that.
You've just forgotten.
It's a fairy tale.
Oh, one of those.
I don't know any.
Your mother and father
must have told you a fairy tale.
No. My mother thinks
they're silly.
I don't know whether my father
thinks they're silly or not.
I never met my father.
My father and mother were
divorced when I was a baby.
Well, that baseball player
looks like a giant to me.
People sometimes grow very big,
but that's abnormal.
I'll bet your mother
told you that, too.
Hello.
I'm Susan's mother.
Yes, I know.
Won't you come in?
Suzie's told me quite a lot
about you. I'm Fred Gailey.
Yes, I know.
Susan's told me quite
a lot about you, too.
- Hello, Mother!
- Hello, dear.
A cup of coffee?
You must be half frozen.
- Oh, don't bother.
- It's all ready.
In that case, thanks.
What do you think of my parade?
It's much better
than last year's.
Well, I hope
Mr. Macy agrees with you.
Sugar? Cream?
Both? Neither?
Just one sugar, please.
This is very kind of you,
Mr. Gailey.
Sit down.
I want to thank you
for being so kind to Susan.
Cleo tells me you took them
to the zoo yesterday.
That's right,
but I must confess.
It's part of a deep-dyed plot.
I'm fond of Suzie, very fond,
but I also wanted to meet you.
I read someplace the surest way
to meet the mother...
is to be kind to the child.
What a horrible trick.
It worked.
There goes Santa Claus.
Oh, don't even
mention the name.
He's much better
than last year's.
At least this one
doesn't wear glasses.
This one was
a last-minute substitute.
The one I hired I fired.
Why?
You remember
the janitor last New Year's?
Ohh, yes.
Well,
this one was much worse.
Oh.
I see she doesn't
believe in Santa Claus, either.
No Santa Claus,
no fairy tales...
no fantasies of any kind,
is that it?
That's right.
We should be realistic...
and completely truthful
with our children...
and not have them growing up
believing in...
a lot of legends and myths
like Santa Claus, for example.
I see.
That's the end.
The acrobats were good.
They ought to be
at those prices.
Thanks for the coffee.
And thank you
for inviting me in.
It was a pleasure, missy.
Mother, I was thinking...
we've got such
a big turkey for dinner...
and there are only two of us.
Couldn't we invite Mr. Gailey?
Oh, don't even
think about it.
I'll have a sandwich
or something.
It's an awful big turkey.
That's not it, dear...
but I'm sure Mr. Gailey
has other plans.
No, he hasn't. Have you?
To be quite honest
and truthful with the child...
I must admit
I haven't any other plans.
Please, Mother!
Did I ask all right?
Hmm?
Didn't I ask all right,
Mr. Gailey?
That all depends.
Dinner's at 3:00.
Thanks.
Suzie, honey,
you asked just right.
I'll see you at 3:00.
- It worked.
- Yes.
I tell you,
Mrs. Walker, he's stupendous.
Everybody's crazy about him.
So is Mr. Macy.
Well, hire him,
by all means.
It's perfectly
all right with me.
It'll save me a frantic search
in the morning.
Yes. That's right.
I'll take care of it as soon
as he gets through.
You'll love him.
I just know that
with that man on the throne...
my department will sell
more toys than it ever has.
He's a born salesman.
I just feel it.
Yes, yes, yes.
We'll talk about it
in the morning. Good-bye.
Good-bye.
And you'll find toys
of all kinds at Macy's.
Gee, that sure is
an elegant costume.
Yes. I've had it
for years and years.
Sure makes a bum
out of the one they gave you.
Even that one's better
than the one I wear.
You, Alfred?
I play Santa Claus
over at the "Y" near our block.
No kidding!
Started about three years ago.
They had a costume,
but it didn't have no padding...
and since I carry my own
padding around with me...
I got the job, see?
You enjoy impersonating me?
- Oh, yeah.
- Why?
I don't know. It's...
When I give packages
to little kids...
I like to watch
their faces get that...
that Christmas look
all of a sudden.
It makes me feel
kind of good and important.
Pardon me!
I bought
a 23-pound turkey.
I had my daughter and her kids
over for dinner yesterday.
There you are.
Good morning.
Oh, my,
what a striking costume!
Before you go up on the floor,
I want to give you...
a few tips on how to be
a good Santa Claus.
Go right ahead.
Here's a list
of toys that we have to push.
You know, things
that we're overstocked on.
Now, you'll find
that a great many children...
will be undecided as to what
they want for Christmas.
When that happens,
you suggest one of these items.
You understand?
I certainly do.
Good.
You memorize that list...
Oh, no. 9:50.
When you've finished,
come up to the seventh floor.
I'll be waiting for you.
Imagine...
making a child take something
it doesn't want...
just because he bought
too many of the wrong toys.
That's what I've been
fighting against for years...
the way they
commercialize Christmas.
A lot of bad "isms"
floating around this worid...
but one of the worst
is commercialism.
Make a buck. Make a buck.
Even in Brooklyn,
it's the same.
Don't care what Christmas
stands for.
Just make a buck.
Oh, don't bother.
I'll put it away for you.
Eh?
Oh, thank you, Alfred.
And what should I do
with these?
Throw them on the floor.
I get kind of tired
just sweeping up dust.
Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.
- Well, thank you, Alfred.
Yes, yes, yes.
Peter's a fine name.
What do you want
for Christmas, Peter?
A fire engine, just like
the big ones only smaller...
that has a real hose
that squirts real water.
I won't do it in the house,
only in the backyard.
I promise.
Psst! Psst!
Macy's ain't got any.
Nobody's got any.
Well, Peter,
I can tell you're a good boy.
You'll get your fire engine.
Oh, thank you very much!
You see?
I told you he'd get me one.
That's fine.
That's just dandy.
Listen, you wait over there.
Mama wants to thank
Santa Claus, too.
Say, listen,
what's the matter with you?
Don't you understand English?
I tell you nobody's got any.
I've been all over.
My feet are killing me.
A fine thing, promising the kid.
You don't think I would've
said that unless I'm sure?
You can get those fire engines
at Schoenfeld's on Lexington.
Only 8.50. A wonderful bargain.
Schoenfeld's?
I don't get it.
I keep track of
the toy market pretty closely.
Does that surprise you so?
Surprise me?
Macy's sending people
to other stores?
Are you kidding me?
The only important thing
is to make the children happy.
Who sells the toy
doesn't make any difference.
Don't you feel that way?
Who, me? Oh, yeah, sure.
Only I didn't know Macy's did.
As long as I'm here, they do.
I don't get it.
No, I just don't get it.
I quite understand.
Your little girl
would like some skates.
But of course,
you must get her the best...
'cause their little ankles
want protecting.
Our skates are very good,
but not quite good enough.
You go to Gimbels.
They'll have exactly what
you're looking for.
There you are, dear.
That's for you.
Merry Christmas.
Gimbels.
Hello, my little girl.
How old are you?
Gimbels.
Gimbels!
Pardon me.
The guard said to speak to you.
You're the head
of the toy department?
Yes, madam...
Listen. I want to
congratulate you and Macy's...
on this wonderful new stunt
you're pulling.
Imagine, sending people
to other stores.
I don't get it. Why, it's...
- It certainly is.
- You said it.
Imagine a big outfit
like Macy's...
putting the spirit of Christmas
ahead of the commercial.
It's wonderful.
I never done
much shopping here before...
but from now on, I'm going
to be a regular Macy customer.
All right, dear.
Thank you, madam.
There are six more
women who want to thank you.
Not now. I've got
to think this thing over.
Personally, I think
it's a wonderful idea, too.
You think so.
Those women think so.
The point is,
will Mr. Macy think so?
This seems awfully silly,
Mr. Gailey.
I thought as long
as we're in the store...
you might as well
say hello to Santa Claus.
Why?
Because when
you talk to him...
you might feel
differently about him.
Good-bye, Elmer.
Be a good boy now.
Merry Christmas!
Well, young lady,
what's your name?
Susan Walker.
What's yours?
Mine? Kris Kringle.
I'm Santa Claus.
Oh, you don't believe that,
do you?
My mother's Mrs. Walker,
the lady who hired you.
Oh.
But I must say,
you're the best one I've seen.
Really?
Your beard doesn't have
those things over your ears.
That's because it's real,
like I'm really Santa Claus.
Oh, go ahead, pull it.
Ouch.
All right, folks,
don't crowd.
You have all day
to see Santa Claus.
Now, children, behave.
This way, please.
Get back in the line there.
What would you like me
to bring you for Christmas?
Nothing, thank you.
Oh, come now.
You must want something.
Whatever I want,
my mother will get for me...
if it's sensible and doesn't
cost too much, of course.
Hello, Mother.
Hello, Susan, Mr. Gailey.
I think you've taken up enough
of this gentleman's time.
The explanation for this
is all very simple.
Cleo's mother
sprained her ankle.
She had to go home and asked me
to bring Suzie down to you.
Yes, Cleo called me.
I was wondering where you were.
As long as we're here,
we should say hello to Santa.
He's a nice old man,
and those whiskers are real.
Yes, dear. Many men
have long beards like that.
Susan, would you stand
over here a minute?
I want to talk to Mr. Gailey.
I shouldn't have brought
Suzie to see Santa Claus?
You're making me feel
like the proverbial stepmother.
I'm sorry, but I just
couldn't see any harm...
in just saying hello
to the old fellow.
But I think there is harm.
I tell her Santa Claus is
a myth, you bring her here...
and she sees hundreds
of gullible children...
meets a very convincing
old man with real whiskers.
This sets up a very harmful
mental conflict within her.
What is she going to think?
Who is she going to believe?
And by filling them
full of fairy tales...
they grow up considering life
a fantasy instead of a reality.
They keep waiting for
Prince Charming to come along.
And when he does,
he turns out to be a...
We were talking
about Suzie, not about you.
Whether you agree or not...
I must ask you to respect
my wishes regarding Susan.
She's my responsibility...
and I must bring her up
as I see fit.
OK.
- Say "Thank you."
- Thank you.
Bye. Merry Christmas!
Well, young lady,
what's your name?
I'm sorry.
She doesn't speak English.
She's Dutch. She just came over.
She's been living
in an orphans home...
in Rotterdam ever since...
We've adopted her.
I told her you wouldn't
be able to speak to her...
but when she saw you
in the parade yesterday...
she said you were
"Sinter Claes"...
and you could talk to her.
I didn't know what to do.
Hello.
Now do you understand?
Yes, I see what
you mean, Mother.
Good.
But when he spoke Dutch
to that girl, he was so...
Susan, I speak French,
but I'm not Joan of Arc.
What I'm trying
to explain is... Come in.
They said you wanted
to see me, Mrs. Walker.
Come right in.
Hello there!
Good to see you again.
It's nice to see you.
You're awfully lucky,
Mrs. Walker.
Lovely little girl
you have here.
Thank you. Susan's why
I asked you to drop down.
She's a little confused...
and I thought you could help
straighten her out.
Oh, glad to.
Would you please tell her
you're not really Santa Claus...
that there actually
is no such person?
I'm sorry to disagree
with you, Mrs. Walker.
Not only is there such a person,
but here I am to prove it.
No, you misunderstand.
I want you to tell her
the truth. What's your name?
Kris Kringle. I'll bet
you're in the first grade.
Second.
I mean your real name.
That is my real name.
Second grade?
It's a progressive school.
Oh,
it's a progressive school.
May I have this man's
employment card, please?
Yes, Mrs. Walker.
This dress is very cute.
Where did you get
such a lovely outfit?
Here at Macy's.
We get 10% off.
Please don't feel
you have to pretend for Susan.
She's a very
intelligent child...
and always wants to know
the absolute truth.
Good, because I always
tell the absolute truth.
About your school...
What's the name of your teacher?
Mrs. Haley.
- Here it is, Mrs. Walker.
- Thank you.
What else do you do
besides read and play games?
We have rest periods
for one half-hour.
I don't suppose
you care for that, eh?
No. We're not allowed
to talk or anything.
Tuesday, Chester Richards
kept talking all the time.
My, that was bad, eh?
Mrs. Haley made him rest
all alone for nearly an hour.
Susan, would you go out
and talk to Miss Adams?
I'll be right with you.
All right. Good-bye.
Good-bye, young lady.
Hope to see you again.
Thank you.
I hope so, too. Bye.
Good-bye.
I'm sorry, Mr., uh... Mr...
Kringle.
I'm sorry, but we're
going to have to make a change.
Change?
The Santa Claus
that we had two years ago...
is back in town,
and I feel we owe it to him...
Have I done something wrong?
Oh, no, no.
Well...
Yes?
Mr. Macy wants
to see you immediately.
I'll be right up.
Would you sit down...
and I'll be right back
and sign your pay voucher.
Yes, indeed.
Go right in.
Mr. Macy's waiting.
The effect this will
have on the public is...
Come in, Mrs. Walker.
- Hello, Mrs. Walker.
- Sit over here.
I've been telling these
gentlemen the new policy...
you and Mr. Shellhammer
initiated.
I can't say that I approve
of your not consulting...
the advertising department
first...
but in the face of this
tremendous public response...
I can't be angry with you.
- What's he talking about?
- Tell you later.
Now, to continue, gentlemen.
I admit this plan sounds
idiotic and impossible.
Imagine Macy's Santa Claus
sending customers to Gimbels.
Ho ho. But, gentlemen,
you cannot argue with success.
Look at this.
Telegrams,
messages, telephone calls.
The governor's wife,
the mayor's wife...
over 500 thankful parents...
expressing
undying gratitude to Macy's.
Never in my entire career...
have I seen such a tremendous
and immediate response...
to a merchandising policy.
And I'm positive, Frank,
if we expand our policy...
we'll expand
our results as well.
Therefore, from now on...
not only will our Santa Claus
continue in this manner...
but I want every salesperson
in this store...
to do precisely the same thing.
If we haven't got exactly
what the customer wants...
we'll send him
where he can get it.
No high pressuring
and forcing a customer...
to take something
he doesn't really want.
We'll be known
as the helpful store...
the friendly store,
the store with a heart...
the store that places
public service ahead of profits.
And, consequently, we'll make
more profits than ever before.
Yes, I know it's late,
and we're all tired...
and we want to go to dinner...
so we'll continue first thing
in the morning.
In the meantime,
you fellas get together...
and figure out the best way
to promote this thing.
We'll do that. Good night, R.H.
Good night.
I want to thank you two again.
And in your
Christmas envelopes...
you'll find a more practical
expression of my gratitude.
Thank you, Mr. Macy.
Tell that Santa
I won't forget him, either.
Yes, Mr. Macy.
Imagine, a bonus!
He just assumed it was our idea.
What's the matter?
- I fired him.
- Who?
- Santa Claus.
- What?
He's crazy.
He thinks he is Santa Claus.
I don't care if
he thinks he's the Easter Bunny.
Get him back.
He's insane, I tell you.
We'll hire somebody else
and have him do the same thing.
You heard Mr. Macy.
We've got to keep him.
What if he should have
a sudden fit?
Oh, no.
I've got to tell Mr. Macy.
But maybe
he's only a little crazy...
like painters or composers...
or some of those men
in Washington.
We can't be sure
until he's been examined.
If you fire him, and we find out
he wasn't really crazy...
Mr. Macy will have us
examined and fired.
I suppose
we ought to be sure.
We could if Mr. Sawyer
talked to him.
Of course.
He's a psychologist.
He's paid to examine employees.
Until we get his report,
we won't say a word.
I'll get in touch
with him right away.
First,
get that Santa Claus back!
The examination is worthless
without the patient.
It was just because
I felt we owed it to him...
but Mr. Macy suggested
that we find something else...
for the other Santa Claus
and keep you on by all means.
Oh, well, thanks.
That's mighty good news.
You'll be here
in the morning then?
Certainly I will.
Mrs. Walker, this is
quite an opportunity for me.
For the past 50 years or so...
I've been getting more
worried about Christmas.
Seems we're all so busy trying
to beat the other fellow...
in making things go faster,
look shinier, and cost less...
that Christmas and I are sort of
getting lost in the shuffle.
I don't think so.
Christmas is still Christmas.
Christmas isn't just a day.
It's a frame of mind.
That's what's been changing.
That's why I'm glad I'm here.
Maybe I can do something.
And I'm glad
I met you and your daughter.
You two are a test case for me.
We are?
Yes. You're sort of
the whole thing in miniature.
If I can win you over,
there's still hope.
If not,
then I guess I'm through.
But I'm warning you,
I don't give up easily.
Good night.
Good night.
Oh, Mr. Kringle,
first thing in the morning...
would you report
to Mr. Sawyer's office?
He'll give you
a little examination.
Oh, we do it
with all our employees.
A mental examination?
Well...
I don't mind.
I've taken dozens of them.
Never failed one yet.
Know them by heart.
- How many days in the week?
- Seven.
- How many fingers do you see?
- Four.
Muscular coordination test.
No damage
to the nervous system.
Who was the first president
of the United States?
George Washington.
Who was vice president
under John Quincy Adams?
Daniel D. Tompkins.
I'll bet your Mr. Sawyer
doesn't know that.
Good night.
Miss Adams, would you get me...
the Brooks' Memorial Home
in Great Neck?
It's a home for old people.
That's right.
I want to talk
to the doctor in charge.
- How many days in the week?
- Seven.
The first president
of the United States?
George Washington.
Three times five?
You asked me that before.
The answer's at the bottom...
I'm conducting this examination.
How much is three times five?
Same as before... 15.
You're rather nervous,
aren't you, Mr. Sawyer?
Do you get enough sleep?
My personal habits
are of no concern to you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I hate to see someone tied up...
- How many fingers do you see?
- Three.
You bite your nails, too.
Tsk tsk tsk.
I want you to stand
with your feet together...
and your arms extended.
Then I want you to...
Muscular coordination test?
Surely. Be glad to. Ha ha.
Sometimes the cause
of nervous habits like yours...
is not obvious. No.
Often they're the result
of an insecurity.
Are you happy at home?
That will be all!
The examination's over.
You may go.
Thank you.
You may go out that way.
And it may
interest you to know...
that I've been happily
married for 26 years.
Really? Delighted to hear it.
Good-bye.
Get me Mrs. Walker.
Yes, sir. Your wife's on 672.
She says it's very important.
How many times have I told you
not to bother me at the office?
No. Not a penny.
I give you a liberal allowance.
It's up to you
to run the house on it.
If your stupid brother
would get a job...
you wouldn't have to
pester me all the time.
Mrs. Walker, I'd like to talk
to you about this Kringle.
Oh, yes. Dr. Pierce
from the Brooks' home is here.
It would be a good time
to settle the matter.
Sorry, Doctor,
but that was Mr. Sawyer...
the gentleman
I was telling you about.
He's just down the hall.
I can't tell you how
we appreciate your time.
Matter of fact,
I was going to call you today.
I had a feeling about now
you'd be wondering about Kris.
Dr. Pierce, Mr. Sawyer.
How do you do?
After giving this man
a comprehensive examination...
it's my opinion he should
be dismissed immediately.
Really? He failed
to pass the examination?
- Yes.
- He didn't answer correctly?
Yes, he did,
but he lacked concentration.
He kept changing the subject.
Even questioned me.
I don't think
there's any doubt about it.
He should be placed
in a mental institution.
I don't agree.
People are institutionalized...
to prevent them from
harming themselves or others.
Mr. Kringle
is incapable of either.
His is a delusion for good.
He only wants
to be friendly and helpful.
That's what I feel, too.
Thousands of people
have similar delusions...
living perfectly normal lives
in every other respect.
A famous example
is that fellow...
I can't think of his name.
For years, he's insisted
he's a Russian prince.
There's been much evidence
to prove him wrong...
but nothing
has shaken his story.
Is he in an institution?
No. He owns a famous restaurant
in Hollywood...
and is a highly
respected citizen.
I've made a great study
of abnormal psychology...
and I've found from experience
when a delusion is challenged...
the deluded
is apt to become violent.
I'll have to disagree
with you again.
If you tell Kris
there is no Santa Claus...
I grant he'll argue the point,
but he'll not become violent.
His whole manner
suggests aggressiveness!
Look how he carries that cane!
He's never without it.
I know Kris
always carries a cane...
but surely you're not implying
he'd use the cane as a weapon?
Mrs. Walker, naturally
I can't discharge this man.
That's up to you.
But you asked my opinion.
So when he exhibits his latent
maniacal tendencies...
which I assure you he will...
please realize
the responsibility is yours.
Speaking of delusions...
Now we're right back
where we started.
No, we're not.
After listening to Dr. Pierce,
I feel perfectly confident.
But if anything happens,
you won't get blamed. I will.
Nothing's going to happen.
Please don't feel what I've said
was prompted by affection.
My specialty is geriatrics.
Huh?
Treatment
of the diseases of old age.
I've had quite a bit
of experience...
and I assure you Kris has
no latent maniacal tendencies.
You'll want to discuss this
with Mr. Shellhammer...
so I'll be on my way.
May I see Kris?
Why, certainly, Doctor.
Use the employees' elevator.
It's much quicker.
The same one you came up on.
- Where is that?
- I'll show you.
That isn't necessary.
I'll find my way.
You understand
my position, Doctor.
If there's the slightest
possibility...
of him becoming violent
or getting into trouble...
What trouble could he get into?
All that's got to happen
is a policeman to ask his name.
A big argument.
Clang, clang! Bellevue!
You can prevent that
very simply.
If he could
stay with an employee...
they could ride
to and from work together.
I'd prefer he didn't take the
train to Great Neck twice a day.
That would solve everything.
They could steer him away
from trouble.
Sort of take custody of him.
Do you think
he'd agree to that?
I'll talk to him.
I'm sure he will.
In that case, he can stay.
Good. Thank you.
It's the seventh floor,
and thank you very much.
- Bye, Doctor.
- Bye.
I'm sure
you made a wise decision.
Now, let's see...
who could rent him a room?
You.
Your son's away at school.
What about his room?
Well, I don't mind.
I'd be glad to.
I'm positive Mrs. Shellhammer
wouldn't like it.
She's a little...
Say, I have an idea.
We always have martinis
before dinner.
I'll make them
double-strength tonight.
I'll bet after a couple of them,
she'll be more receptive.
But Kris is through work
at 6:00.
What about
the in-between time?
Take him home to dinner.
I'll call soon as my wife's
plastered... feeling gay.
Oh, no.
If I'm willing
to let my wife...
have a big headache
in the morning...
you can have
a little headache tonight.
All right.
Won't take an hour.
Everything will be OK.
Good. Very good.
What sort of games do you play
with the other children?
I don't play much with them.
They play silly games.
They do?
Like today. They were
in the basement playing zoo...
and all of them were animals.
When I came down, Homer...
he was the zookeeper...
he said, "What animal are you?"
I said,
"I'm not an animal, I'm a girl."
And he said,
"Only animals allowed."
So I came upstairs.
Why didn't you tell him
you were a lion or a bear?
Because
I'm not a bear or a lion.
But the other children
were only children...
and they were pretending
to be animals.
That's what makes
the game so silly.
I don't think so.
Sounds like
a wonderful game to me.
Of course, in order to play it,
you need an imagination.
Do you know
what the imagination is?
Oh, sure.
That's when you see things,
but they're not really there.
That can be caused
by other things, too.
No, to me the imagination
is a place all by itself...
a separate country.
You've heard of the French
or the British nation.
Well, this is
the Imagine nation.
It's a wonderful place.
How would you like to make
snowballs in the summertime?
Or drive a big bus
right down 5th Avenue?
How would you like to have
a ship all to yourself...
that makes daily trips
to China and Australia?
How would you like to be
the Statue of Liberty...
in the morning,
and in the afternoon...
fly south with a flock of geese?
It's very simple.
Of course, it takes practice.
The first thing you've got
to learn is how to pretend.
And the next time Homer says,
"What kind of animal are you?"
Tell him you're a monkey.
I don't know how to be a monkey.
Sure you do.
Here, I'll show you.
Now just bend
your body over a little.
Let your arms hang loose, see?
Now put your right hand
up here... under here.
Now scratch yourself, see?
That's right.
Put your tongue under your lips,
over your teeth.
- Like this?
- That's right.
Now scratch yourself
and chatter, see?
- Bla bla bla!
- Eeek!
Eeek erp!
Haislip, Haislip, Sherman,
Mackenzie, and Haislip...
have been very kind to me.
But being an exceptional lawyer,
I want to open my own office.
Put this in
Susan's place for me, please.
Take the meat out.
It should be done.
Don't forget to scratch.
Put your tongue up
in front of your teeth.
Talk to the other monkeys.
What's going on here?
We're having
our first lesson in pretending.
Doing quite well at it, too.
That's right.
Call the other monkeys.
No. You mustn't be a goose.
Be a monkey.
- Mr. Kringle...
- Yes?
Mrs. Walker
just happened to mention...
that they're looking
for a room for you.
That's right.
Dr. Pierce doesn't want me
making the long trip daily.
I was just thinking.
I'm all alone in my apartment.
Twin beds, plenty of room.
If you'd like
to move in with me...
I'd be only too happy
to have you.
That's awfully nice of you.
You could ride to and from
work with Mrs. Walker.
Yes. That would
give me a chance...
to really talk things
over with her.
Don't forget to scratch.
You're not scratching.
Besides, I could see
Suzie now and then.
Mr. Gailey, it's a deal.
Good!
We'll get your things
after dinner.
Hello.
Oh, yes, just a moment.
It's a Mr. Shellhammer.
Thanks.
Hello, Mr. Shellhammer.
Yes. Just a moment.
Mrs. Shellhammer
wants to talk to you.
I made the martinis
triple-strength...
and she feels wonderful.
Here, my pet.
Ha ha.
Hello?
Hello?
No, no. No, dear.
Thank you, darling.
Hello?
No, no, dear. There.
Oh, darling, how silly of me!
Hello!
We'd love to have Santa Claus
come and stay with us.
I think it would be
simply charming.
Oh, and so do I,
Mrs. Shellhammer.
Just a moment.
It's Mrs. Shellhammer.
They have the loveliest room.
They'd be so happy
if you'd stay with them.
That's very sweet of them.
Please thank them very much...
but I'm going to stay
with Mr. Gailey.
Mr. Gailey.
I think
I'd better get the meat.
Yes, I understand that...
but there must be something
you want for Christmas...
something you haven't
even told your mother.
Oh, come on, now.
Why don't you give me a chance?
Well...
That's what
I want for Christmas.
A doll's house like this?
No, a real house.
If you're really Santa Claus,
you can get it for me.
And if you can't...
you're only a nice man with
a white beard, like mother said.
Now wait a minute, Suzie.
Just because every child
can't get his wish...
doesn't mean
there isn't a Santa Claus.
That's what I thought you'd say.
But don't you see, dear?
Some children wish for things
they couldn't possibly use...
like real locomotives
or B-29s.
But this isn't like
a locomotive or a B-29.
It's awful big
for a little girl like you.
What could you do
with a house like this?
Live in it with my mother.
But you've got
this lovely apartment.
I don't think it's lovely.
I want a backyard with a great
big tree to put a swing on...
I guess you can't get it, huh?
I didn't say that.
Well...
Well, it's a tall order...
but I'll do my best.
May I keep this picture?
Mm-hmm.
Thank you. Good night, Susan.
Good night, Mr. Kringle.
Nice place you've got here.
Was I lucky to get it!
You like living
in Manhattan?
It's all right.
Someday I'd like to get
a place on Long Island.
Not a big house.
One of those junior-partner
deals around Manhasset.
I know just
the kind of place you mean.
One of those
little Colonial houses.
Either that or Cape Cod.
You're right about Mrs. Walker.
A little more effort
on your part...
and she might crawl out
of that shell.
Take her to dinner, the theater.
I've tried that.
She's always too busy
with her job.
Try a little harder.
Those two are lost souls.
It's up to us to help them.
I'll take care of Suzie
if you take care of her mother.
- It's a deal.
- Ready?
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm not gonna be cheated.
All my life
I've wondered something.
Now's my chance to find out.
It's a question that's puzzled
the worid for centuries.
Does Santa Claus sleep
with his whiskers outside or in?
Always sleep with them out.
Cold air makes them grow.
Joe, we're running
out of books.
I'll get some right away.
I need some more Wanamakers.
Yes, I know just what you want.
We don't carry that brand,
but I think Gimbels does.
Let me see. Yes, here it is.
I thought I noticed it before.
Looks like
an exceptional bargain.
Yes, it does. Thank you.
Not at all.
Why didn't one of you
think of this idea?
It's the greatest
goodwill policy I ever heard of.
Every shopper
in New York City...
suddenly thinks of Macy
as a benevolent soul...
thinking only of the welfare
of the public.
And what does that make Gimbel?
Nothing but a profiteering
moneygrubber.
Two can play at this game.
From now on, if we haven't got
what the customer wants...
send him back to Macy's.
And what's more, we'll do
the same thing in our stores...
in Philadelphia,
Milwaukee, and Pittsburgh.
Get to work on it right away.
So, Gimbel's doing it
in Philadelphia...
Pittsburgh, and Milwaukee, eh?
And very successfully.
Well, we can cover
the country, too.
Notify our stores
in San Francisco...
Atlanta, Toledo, and Newark
to get going right away.
All right, Mr. Macy.
- Look this way, Mr. Gimbel.
- Hold it, Mr. Gimbel.
One more.
That's fine.
Now we'll take some
at my store.
Just a minute.
I have something I'd like
to give our friend here.
This is a little something
to show my appreciation...
for all you've done.
Thank you, Mr. Macy.
Ooh! That's very kind of you.
I didn't think
you were that generous.
That's a bit of money.
What are you going
to do with it?
Well, I have a friend.
A doctor.
He's been very kind to me.
He needs an x-ray machine.
I don't think
that's going to be enough.
I'll make up the difference.
Buy it through the store.
Get 10% discount.
I can get it for cost.
Good night, Susan.
Good night, Cleo.
Like me to sing you
a good night song?
If you want to.
Doesn't your mother
ever sing to you at night?
Uh-uh. Why should she?
Oh, no reason.
I just think it's kind of nice.
- Do you like "Market"?
- All right.
To market, to market
to buy a fat pig
Home again, home again,
jiggidy jig
To market, to market
to buy a fat hog
Home again, home again,
jiggidy...
Amazing.
Do you happen
to have a spare piece?
Mm-hmm.
Well, here goes.
Oh!
- Hello, Alfred.
- Hello, Kris.
How about a game
of checkers after lunch?
Leave us not today.
I don't feel like it.
Oh? What's the matter?
Nothing. Nothing.
Something is wrong.
What is it?
Well,
remember I was telling you...
how I like to play Santa
at the "Y" on Christmas...
and give out packages
to the young kids?
I was telling that
to Mr. Sawyer, see...
and he says that's very bad.
Sawyer. You mean, uh...
That's the one.
He's a psychologist.
Ohh,
that's a debatable poin...
Why is it bad, does he say?
He says guys who dress
like Santa Claus, see...
and give presents away...
do it because
when they was young...
they must have
did something bad...
and they feel guilty about it.
So now they do something
they think is good...
to make up for it.
It's what he calls
a guilt complex.
How old are you, Alfred?
Seventeen.
Seventeen.
Doesn't seem you've had time
to be guilty of anything...
except overeating.
It's nothing to laugh about.
It's pretty serious, he says.
It's a lot of rubbish, Alfred.
Don't listen.
Oh, he knows
what he's talking about.
He's been studying that stuff
for a long time.
Well, what's the basis
of this guilt complex...
you're supposed to have?
Does he say that?
Well, he ain't found out yet.
It's probably way down
inside of me someplace, see?
Maybe something that happened
when I was a baby, he says.
It takes time,
but he'll do it, he says.
You mean
you're going to him again?
Sure.
I go every day after lunch.
Oh, he don't soak me nothin'.
He's doing it for free
'cause I'm an interesting case.
Yes.
What else has he found
wrong with you, Alfred?
Anything else?
No. Oh, just
that I hate my father.
I didn't know it,
but he says I do.
And he sees you every day?
Yeah. I say anything
that comes into my head.
Excuse me, Alfred.
A few things
have just come into my head...
and I'm going to say them.
Why are you busting in here?
Are you a licensed psychiatrist?
What business is it of yours?
I have great respect
for psychiatry...
and great contempt for amateurs
who go around practicing it.
You have no more right
to analyze Alfred...
than a dentist has
to remove a gallbladder!
I beg your pardon.
Your job here, I gather,
is to give intelligence tests.
Passing yourself off
as a psychologist.
You ought to be horsewhipped...
taking a normal, impressionable
boy like Alfred...
and filling him with complexes.
I'm better equipped
to judge that than you are.
Just because the boy
wants to be kind to children...
you tell him
he has a guilt complex.
Sharing his delusion,
you couldn't understand.
Alfred's definitely maladjusted,
and I'm helping.
Maladjusted?!
You talk about maladjusted.
It seems to me the patient
is running the clinic here.
I won't stand...
Leave this office immediately.
Now either
you stop analyzing Alfred...
or I go straight to Mr. Macy...
and tell him what a contemptible
fraud you are.
Leave or I'll call security.
There's only one way
to handle a man like you.
You won't listen to reason.
You're heartless.
You have no humanity.
Are you going to leave?
Yes.
- Kris.
- Mr. Sawyer!
Mr. Sawyer,
are you all right?
Look at that bump!
Mr. Sawyer...
He's unconscious!
Better get a wet towel.
No, better get a doctor.
You must have done
something to him.
I tell you
we were merely talking...
but when I mentioned Santa Claus
and attacked his delusion...
he became violent.
I told you he had
latent maniacal tendencies.
Well, I think this proves it.
Have Dr. Pierce
give him another examination.
Dr. Pierce...
He doesn't know anything
about this sort of thing.
He's a general practitioner.
You must admit
this is rather serious.
Perhaps we'd better get
a competent psychiatrist.
But he's taken dozens
of those examinations...
and passed them all 100%.
It's possible
his condition has changed.
I don't think
we can take any chances.
I can't see any harm in it.
If he passes the test,
he can return to work at once...
and if he doesn't,
it's better if we find out.
You better have
the examination right away...
before he tells Mr. Ma...
before Mr. Macy finds out.
Oh, my, yes.
You explain to Mr. Kringle.
After all, you're his friend.
I won't do it.
I've grown very fond of him.
This would be like telling him
I thought he was insane.
You don't call this
acting normal, do you?
Of course I don't...
but there are thousands
of elderly who aren't normal.
This will hurt Kris deeply,
and I don't want to do it!
That wouldn't be fair to him.
I'll tell him the truth.
I believe in being truthful
with people.
If he sees me
or you mention psychiatrist...
it's more or less attacking
his delusion again.
He's apt to become violent.
But in front of the children?
Oh, that would be terrible.
Get him out of the store
on some other pretext.
Then once outside,
I'll explain it to him.
If you think
it's better that way.
Keep a straight line.
All day long to see Santa Claus.
Oh!
- Mr. Kringle.
- Yes?
Mrs. Walker
wanted you to know...
that we're going to take
some publicity pictures...
this afternoon
down at the city hall...
you and the mayor.
Good. Like to meet him.
A few things
I'd like to discuss with him.
Oh, but I made an appointment
with Mr. Macy at 4:00.
I want to tell him
about something.
You'll be back
in plenty of time.
There's a car waiting
downstairs.
It's starting to drizzle.
You'll need a coat.
I'll get it.
Thanks. Be right with you.
I just want to take care
of a few kiddies first.
All right.
Where to?
Bellevue.
Bellevue?!
Did she know about this?
Yes.
We all discussed it.
The second party shall...
in consideration
of the property...
agree to be conveyed
by the first party to...
Excuse me, Gertrude. Telephone.
Hello.
Yes. Yes.
Why, yes,
we share an apartment together.
Bellevue?
But why, Doctor? What did he...
Oh, he's quite comfortable.
He's going to be with us
for a few days...
and wondered if you could bring
his personal things.
Yes, in view
of his examination...
I'm afraid I shall have
to recommend commitment.
Yes, I know, Mr. Gailey...
but I'd rather speak to you
in person.
I'll be right over, Doctor.
To see the new patient.
- Thanks.
- Not at all.
Hello, Kris.
Fred.
Why'd you do it, Kris?
You deliberately failed
that examination, didn't you?
Why?
Because the last few days
I've had great hope.
I had a feeling Doris was
beginning to believe in me.
And now I find out she was just
humoring me all the time.
I just telephoned her.
She didn't know anything about
taking pictures with the mayor.
That was Sawyer's idea.
Well, I'm glad of that.
But why didn't she come to me
and explain the whole thing?
She didn't want to hurt you.
Only because I was a nice,
kind old man she felt sorry for.
That's not true.
Yes, it is.
She had doubts.
That's why she was just sorry.
If you'd been dragged off here
instead of me...
she wouldn't have been sorry.
She'd have been furious.
All right,
she had doubts. Why not?
She hasn't really believed
in anything for years.
You can't expect her
to suddenly...
Oh, it's not just Doris.
There's Mr. Sawyer.
He's contemptible, dishonest,
selfish, deceitful, vicious...
Yet he's out there
and I'm in here.
He's called normal and I'm not.
Well, if that's normal,
I don't want it.
That's why
I answered incorrectly.
But, Kris, you can't
just think of yourself.
What happens to you matters
to a lot of people.
People like me, who believe
in what you stand for...
and people like Suzie,
who are just beginning to.
You can't quit.
You can't let them down.
No, I suppose I shouldn't.
Who knows, maybe someday
the Sawyers will be in here...
instead of out there.
You're right.
I ought to be ashamed of myself.
Even if we can't win,
we can go down swinging.
Let's get out of here.
Now, wait a minute.
You're forgetting you flunked
your examination but good.
Oh, yes, I forgot.
I said Calvin Coolidge
was the first president.
I can imagine what they're
thinking of me for saying that.
But you'll get me out of this.
You'll think of something.
It's not gonna be easy, Kris.
It will be for you.
I believe you're the greatest
lawyer since Darrow.
Just a second, Kris.
You're putting me in a bad spot.
But I believe in you.
You can't let me down.
But you don't understand. It...
I'll do everything I can, Kris.
Thank you.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
That's a lot of nonsense!
Dangerous, my foot!
I don't care
if he failed ten examinations.
You had no right to do it!
You get the case
dropped tomorrow...
or you might have another lump
to match the one Kris gave you!
Yes, Mr. Macy.
Age unknown.
Old man, huh?
Very old, Your Honor.
I suppose
I'll have to read all this.
Take my word for it.
Just routine commitment papers.
Cut and dried.
The man calls himself
Kris Kringle...
thinks he's Santa Claus.
Uh-oh.
Come in.
Mr. Gailey to see you,
Your Honor.
He represents Mr. Kringle.
Better show him in.
Good morning.
Your Honor, there seems to be
undue haste in this case.
I wish to protect my client's
rights, as I'm sure you do.
Of course.
I request a formal hearing...
to which I may bring witnesses.
- This is cut and dried?
- That's what I was told.
I didn't know anything
about a protest.
Of course, you may sign
the commitment papers now...
but I'll bring
a habeas corpus later.
There's no point in signing.
We'll have a hearing
on Monday morning at 10:00.
Thank you. Good day.
Thank you.
That man...
I heard him say something
about Mr. Kringle before.
Who is he?
His name is Gailey,
Kringle's lawyer.
Probably grabbed the case
to get some cheap publicity.
We can't have that.
Mr. Macy would rather drop this.
It can't be done.
It's too late now.
Kringle has been examined by
city hospital psychiatrists.
It has to follow due process.
We must avoid publicity.
I, uh... Oh.
Mr. Gailey,
I represent Mr. Macy.
My name's Sawyer.
Oh, so you're Sawyer.
Yes.
Regarding this Kringle matter...
We're very anxious
to avoid any publicity.
Naturally.
So if you would agree
to put this through quietly...
we'd surely find a generous way
to express our appreciation.
Very interesting.
Then you'll cooperate?
Very interesting.
Publicity. Hmm.
That's not a bad idea.
If I'm going to win this case...
I'll have to have plenty
of public opinion.
And publicity's
just the way to do it.
Thanks, Mr. Sawyer.
Oh, Mr. Gailey, wait a minute.
Mr. Gailey, one moment, please!
I don't see what
they're making a fuss about.
After all, he's an old man.
How've you been feeling lately?
You look a little run-down.
Me? Why, I feel fine.
Never better.
Why not see the doc?
Take a few weeks off.
Go fishing, go hunting.
Go anyplace.
Why should I?
Because
this Kringle case is dynamite.
Let some judge handle it that
isn't coming up for reelection.
I can't do that.
I'm no legal brain trust.
I don't know
a habeas from a corpus.
But I do know politics.
That's my racket.
I got you elected, didn't I?
And I'm gonna try
to get you reelected.
I appreciate everything
that you've done for me.
Then get off this case.
But why?
You're a Pontius Pilate
the minute you start.
Oh, I don't believe it.
I'm an honest man...
and nobody's going
to hold it against me...
for doing my duty as I see it.
Grandma!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Good night, Terry.
Good night, Alice.
Now, straight to bed.
I promised your mother
you'd be in bed by 8:00...
and it's way past.
Aren't you coming, too?
I'll be up soon
to tuck you in. Now, scoot!
How about a great big kiss
for Grandpa, hmm?
Hmmph!
Hmmph!
Fine way
to treat their grandfather!
No hug, no kiss, no anything.
I don't blame them.
Any man who'd put Santa Claus
on trial for lunacy.
See what I mean?
Hey.
Don't worry about me.
I've got the best lawyer
in the worid.
How long do you think
this will take?
Maybe a week.
A week?! That seems impossible!
That lawyer
won't be stupid enough...
to let him admit anything.
He'll deny everything.
I'll bring witnesses,
and he'll bring witnesses.
Hear ye, hear ye.
All persons having business...
with the supreme court
of the county of New York...
draw near, give attendance,
and ye shall be heard.
You have Kris Kringle's
commitment papers.
I'd like to call
the first witness.
Mr. Kringle,
will you take the stand?
Good morning, Your Honor.
You do solemnly swear...
the testimony you'll give
shall be the whole truth...
so help you God?
I do.
Before you begin, I want
to explain to the witness...
this is a hearing, not a trial.
Mr. Kringle...
you don't have to answer
against your wishes...
or even testify at all.
We have no objection,
Your Honor.
I'll be glad to answer
any questions I can.
What is your name?
Kris Kringle.
Where do you live?
That's what this hearing
will decide.
A very sound answer,
Mr. Kringle.
Do you believe
that you're Santa Claus?
Of course.
The state rests, Your Honor.
Well, Mr. Gailey...
do you wish to cross-examine
the witness?
I believe he was employed
to play Santa Claus.
Perhaps he didn't understand
the question correctly.
Oh, I understood perfectly,
Your Honor.
No further questions
at this time.
Thank you.
In view of this statement...
do you still wish
to put in a defense?
I do, Your Honor.
I'm fully aware
of my client's opinions.
That's the entire case
against him.
All these complicated tests
boil down to this:
Mr. Kringle is not sane...
because he believes himself
to be Santa Claus.
An entirely logical...
and reasonable assumption,
I'm afraid.
It would be if the clerk,
Mr. Marrah, or I...
believed we were Santa Claus.
Anyone who thinks
he's Santa Claus is not sane.
Not necessarily.
You believe yourself
to be Judge Harper...
yet no one questions your sanity
because you are Judge Harper.
I know all about myself,
young man.
Mr. Kringle is the subject
of this hearing.
Yes, Your Honor...
and if he is the person
he believes himself to be...
just as you are,
then he's just as sane.
Granted, but he isn't.
Oh, but he is.
Is what?
I intend to prove
that Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus.
He's crazy, too!
Hi, darling.
Sorry I'm late. Get your coat.
I reserved our table at Luigi's.
We're gonna celebrate.
What are we celebrating?
Read all about it.
"Gailey Throws Court Bombshell."
Yes, I read that.
I didn't see this...
Front page! Good. Good.
You're not serious about this?
Of course I am.
But you can't possibly
prove he's Santa Claus.
Why not? You saw Macy
and Gimbel shaking hands.
That wasn't possible either,
but it happened.
It's the best defense I can use.
Completely logical
and completely unexpected.
And completely idiotic.
What about your bosses...
Haislip and Mackenzie
and the rest?
What do they say?
That I'm jeopardizing
the prestige and dignity...
of an old, established
law firm...
and either I drop this
impossible case immediately...
or they will drop me.
I beat them to it. I quit.
Fred, you didn't.
Of course I did.
I can't let Kris down.
He needs me,
and all the rest of us need him.
Darling,
he's a nice old man...
and I admire you
for wanting to help him...
but you've got to be realistic
and face facts.
You can't just
throw your career away...
because of a sentimental whim.
But I'm not
throwing my career away.
If Haislip feels that way...
so will every other law firm.
I'm sure they will.
I'll open my own office.
What kind of cases will you get?
Probably people like
Kris who are being bullied.
That's the only fun in law
anyway.
If you believe in me
and have faith in me...
everything will...
You don't have any faith in me,
do you?
It's not about faith.
It's just common sense.
Faith is believing in things...
when common sense
tells you not to.
It's not just Kris
that's on trial.
It's everything he stands for.
It's kindness, joy, love,
and all other intangibles.
Fred,
you're talking like a child.
You're living
in a realistic worid!
Those lovely intangibles
aren't worth much.
You don't get ahead that way.
That all depends
on what you call getting ahead.
Evidently,
we have different definitions.
We've talked
about wonderful plans.
Then you go
on an idealistic binge.
You give up your job,
throw away your security...
and then you expect me
to be happy about it!
Yes,
I guess I expected too much.
Someday,
you're going to find out...
that your way of facing
this realistic worid...
just doesn't work.
And when you do...
don't overlook
those lovely intangibles.
You'll discover
they're the only things...
that are worthwhile.
These reporters make me
look like a sadistic monster...
who likes to drown cats...
and tear the wings
off butterflies.
Why, this old man...
Tommy, go get
mother's scissors, will you?
They're in the bedroom.
That's a good boy.
I don't want to discuss
this case in front of him.
It'll break his heart.
While we're on the subject,
I agree with the reporters.
Mr. Kringle seems
to be a nice old man.
I don't see why you have
to keep persecuting him.
Firstly,
I am not persecuting him.
I am prosecuting him.
And secondly,
I like the old man, too.
I wish
I'd never gotten into this.
But it's too late now. There's
nothing I can do about it.
It's up to the state
of New York.
I'm their duly appointed
legal representative.
Kringle has been declared
a menace to society...
by competent doctors.
It's my duty to protect
the state of New York...
and see that he's put away.
No matter what they say
about me...
I've got to do it.
Sometimes I wish I'd married
a butcher or a plumber.
Well, my dear,
if I lose this case...
it's very possible
that you'll get your wish.
Hello, Kris.
Your name?
R.H. Macy.
You are the owner...
of one of the biggest
department stores...
in New York City?
The biggest.
Who is the gentleman
seated there?
Kris Kringle.
- Your employee?
- Yes.
Do you believe him
to be truthful?
Yes.
You believe him to be
of sound mind?
I certainly do.
Mr. Macy, you're under oath.
You really believe
this man is Santa Claus?
Well, I...
Well, he gives
every indication...
Do you really believe
he's Santa Claus?
I do.
You do?
That's all.
Psychologist!
Where'd you graduate from,
a correspondence school?
You're fired.
Your Honor,
I object to this testimony.
It's ridiculous, irrelevant,
and immaterial.
Mr. Gailey is making
a circus of this court.
There is no such person
as Santa Claus...
and everybody knows it.
I submit
it's purely a matter of opinion.
Can Mr. Marrah disprove
Santa's existence?
No. I don't intend to.
This isn't a nursery. It's the
New York State Supreme Court.
I'll not waste this court's time
with such nonsense!
Mr. Marrah seems to have
appointed himself judge.
He's ruling on what testimony
I may introduce.
We request an immediate
ruling from this court.
Is there or is there not
a Santa Claus?
Well...
Ahem!
The court will take a recess
to consider the matter.
I don't care what you do
with old whisker puss...
but if you rule
that there's no Santa Claus...
you better start looking
for that chicken farm.
We won't even be able
to put you in the primaries.
But, Charley, listen to reason.
I'm a responsible judge.
I've taken an oath.
How can I seriously rule
there is a Santa Claus?
Why don't you...
All right.
Tell them the New York
State Supreme Court rules...
there's no Santa Claus.
It's all over the papers.
The kids don't hang up
their stockings.
Now, what happens
to all the toys...
that are supposed to be
in those stockings?
Nobody buys them.
The toy manufacturers
are going to like that.
So they have to lay off
a lot of their employees...
union employees.
Now you got the C.I.O.
And the A.F.L. against you.
And they're gonna adore you
for it.
And they're gonna say it
with votes.
And the department stores
will love you, too...
and the Christmas card makers...
and the candy companies.
Oh, Henry, you're going to be
an awful popular fellow.
And what about
the Salvation Army?
Why, they got a Santa Claus
on every corner...
and they take in a fortune.
But you go ahead, Henry.
You do it your way.
You go on back in there
and tell them...
that you rule
there's no Santa Claus.
But if you do, remember this:
You can count on getting
just two votes...
your own and that
district attorney's out there.
The district attorney's
a Republican.
All rise!
Before making a ruling...
this court has consulted
the highest authority available.
The question of Santa Claus...
seems to be largely
a matter of opinion.
Many people
firmly believe in him.
Others do not.
The tradition
of American justice demands...
a broad, unprejudiced view
of such a controversial matter.
This court, therefore,
intends to keep an open mind.
I'll hear all the evidence.
He's crazy, too.
The burden of proof for this
ridiculous contention...
clearly rests with my opponent.
Can he produce evidence
to support his views?
If Your Honor pleases, I can.
Will Thomas Marrah
please take the stand?
Who, me?
Thomas Marrah, Jr.
Hello, Daddy.
Here you are, Tommy.
Tommy,
you know the difference...
between telling the truth
and telling a lie, right?
Everybody knows you
shouldn't tell a lie...
especially in court.
Proceed, Mr. Gailey.
Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Sure I do.
He gave me a brand-new
flexible flyer sled last year.
And what does he look like?
There he is, sitting there.
Your Honor, I protest!
Overruled.
Tell me, Tommy...
why are you so sure
there's a Santa Claus?
Because my daddy told me so.
Didn't you, Daddy?
You believe your daddy,
don't you?
He's a very honest man.
Of course he is.
My daddy wouldn't tell me
anything that wasn't so.
Would you, Daddy?
Thank you, Tommy.
Good-bye, Daddy.
Your Honor...
Don't forget.
A real official football helmet.
Don't worry, Tommy.
You'll get it.
Your Honor,
the state of New York...
concedes the existence
of Santa Claus.
But we ask that Mr. Gailey
cease presenting...
personal opinion as evidence.
We could bring witnesses
with opposite opinions...
but we desire
to shorten this hearing...
rather than prolong it.
I request that Mr. Gailey...
now submit
authoritative proof...
that Mr. Kringle...
is the one-and-only Santa Claus.
Your point's well taken.
I'm afraid we must agree.
Mr. Gailey, can you show that
Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus...
on the basis
of competent authority?
Not at this time, Your Honor.
I ask for an adjournment
until tomorrow.
Court stands adjourned
till tomorrow afternoon, 3:00.
Well, I guess that's that.
There's a way, Alfred.
There's got to be!
It's hard to explain.
They're having a trial
about him.
You mean like for murder?
No, it isn't that kind
of a trial.
It's just because
he says he's Santa Claus.
I've got a feeling
he is Santa Claus.
Some people don't
believe that. That's why...
But he's so kind
and nice and jolly.
He's not like anyone else.
He must be Santa.
I think
perhaps you're right, Suzie.
Is Mr. Kringle sad now,
Mother?
I'm afraid he is.
I'm sure he misses you.
Then I'll write him
a letter and cheer him up.
Hey, Lou, come here!
Yeah?
Here's a new one.
I seen them write
to Santa Claus...
North Pole, South Pole,
and every other place.
This kid writes...
"Kris Kringle,
New York County Courthouse."
The kid's right.
They got him on trial there.
He claims he's Santa Claus,
and the D.A. Claims he's nuts.
Read it for yourself.
Right on the front page.
Hey, Lou,
how many Santa Claus letters...
we got
at the dead-letter office?
I don't know.
There must be
about 50,000 of them.
Bags and bags
all over the joint.
And there's more coming in
every day.
Yeah. Hey, Lou.
It'd be nice
to get rid of them, huh?
Yeah, but...
Hey, that's a wonderful idea!
Why should we be
bothered with all that stuff?
Why not get some trucks?
Big ones right away.
Load them with Santa Claus mail
and deliver it...
to Mr. Kringle
at the courthouse.
Let somebody else
worry about it, huh?
Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Hello, Kris.
Fred.
Kris, I'm afraid
I've got bad news for you.
I've tried every way to get
some competent authority.
I've wired the governor,
the mayor. I even...
This is worth more to me...
than all the governors
and mayors in the worid.
It's all over. Look at him.
He hasn't got a thing.
And furthermore,
the defense has yet to offer...
one concrete
piece of evidence...
to substantiate
this preposterous claim.
Not one authoritative proof
that this man is Santa Claus.
In view of these facts...
and especially since
today is Christmas Eve...
we're, naturally,
all anxious to get home...
I ask that you sign
the commitment papers...
without further delay.
Mr. Gailey...
have you anything further
to offer?
Yes, I have, Your Honor.
I'd like to submit the following
facts in evidence.
It concerns
the Post Office Department...
an official agency
of the United States government.
"The Post Office Department
was created...
"by the Second
Continental Congress...
"on July 26, 1776.
"The first postmaster general
was Benjamin Franklin.
"The Post Office...
"is one of the worid's
largest business concerns.
"Last year,
under Robert Hannigan...
"it did a gross business
of $1,112,877,174."
We're all gratified to know...
the Post Office
is doing nicely...
but it hardly has
any bearing on this case.
It has a great deal, Your Honor,
if I may be allowed to proceed.
By all means, Mr. Gailey.
Your Honor, the figures
I have just quoted...
indicate an efficiently run
organization.
United States postal laws
and regulations...
make it a criminal offense
to willfully misdirect mail...
or intentionally deliver it
to the wrong party.
Consequently...
the Department uses
every possible precaution.
The state of New York
admires the Post Office.
It is efficient, authoritative,
and prosperous.
We're happy to concede
Mr. Gailey's claims.
For the record?
For the record.
Anything to get this case going.
Then I want
to introduce this evidence.
I'll take them, please.
I have three letters
addressed simply "Santa Claus."
No other address whatsoever.
Yet these were just now
delivered to Mr. Kringle...
by bona fide employees
of the Post Office.
I offer them
as positive proof that...
Uh, three letters
are hardly positive proof.
I understand the Post Office
receives thousands of these.
I have further exhibits,
but I hesitate to produce them.
We'll be very happy to see them.
Yes, yes.
Produce them, Mr. Gailey.
Put them here on my desk.
But, Your Honor...
Put them here on the desk.
Put them here.
Yes, Your Honor.
Your Honor!
Your Honor!
Your Honor...
every one of these letters
is addressed to Santa Claus.
The Post Office
has delivered them.
Therefore, the Post Office...
a branch
of the federal government...
recognizes this man,
Kris Kringle...
to be the one-and-only
Santa Claus!
Since the United States
government...
declares this man
to be Santa Claus...
this court will not dispute it.
Case dismissed.
I've got to get
that football helmet!
Thank you so much,
Your Honor...
and a very merry Christmas
to you.
Thank you, Mr. Kringle,
and the same to you.
Thank you.
Kris.
I had to wait to tell you.
I got your note.
It made me very happy.
Oh, I'm so glad.
We're having
a big Christmas party...
at the Brooks' Home
tomorrow morning.
Breakfast, a beautiful tree.
I'd like to have you and Susan.
Oh, thank you.
There's no one I'd rather
spend Christmas with.
Would you like
to come to dinner tonight?
Tonight? Oh, I can't.
It's Christmas Eve.
Oh, I forgot.
Bye.
Oh, my dear sir...
you know my assistant Alfred,
Mr. Macy?
Merry Christmas, Alfred.
Mr. Macy!
Hello, Alfred.
Mr. Macy!
Kris, all I can say
is the state supreme court...
declared you
to be Santa Claus...
and personally
and professionally...
I agree with them.
But there are lots
of presents there for you.
Not the one I wanted.
Not the one Mr. Kringle
was going to get for me.
Well, what was that?
It doesn't matter.
I didn't get it.
I knew it wouldn't be here...
but I thought
there'd be a letter.
I don't suppose
you even want to talk to me.
Something about a present.
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry, Suzie.
I tried my best, but...
You couldn't get it
because you're not Santa.
You're just a nice old man
with whiskers...
like my mother said...
and I shouldn't have
believed you.
I was wrong
when I told you that.
You must believe in Mr. Kringle
and keep right on doing it.
You must have faith in him.
But he didn't get me the...
That doesn't make sense, Mommy.
Faith is believing in things...
when common sense
tells you not to.
Huh?
Just because things
don't turn out...
the way you want them to
the first time...
you've still got to believe
in people.
I found that out.
You mean like...
"If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again"?
Yes.
I thought so.
May I drive you home?
Thank you.
If you'll go this way,
you'll miss a lot of traffic.
You go along Maplewood
until you've come to Ashley...
I believe. I believe.
It's silly, but I believe.
Thanks, Kris.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.
And to you, my dear,
and many of them.
Good-bye, my dear.
Good-bye, Mrs. Walker.
Good-bye, Alfred.
Good-bye, Suzie.
This must be the turn here.
That's right. Ashley.
Now you go straight
for four blocks.
I believe. I believe.
Stop, Uncle Fred! Stop!
Stop! Stop!
Suzie!
Suzie!
Suzie, where are you going?
What is she doing?
- Suzie!
- Suzie!
Suzie, where are you?
I'm upstairs!
You shouldn't run around
in other people's houses.
You know better than that.
But this is my house,
the one I asked Mr. Kringle for.
It is! I know it is!
My room upstairs is like
I knew it would be!
You were right, Mommy.
Mommy said if things
don't turn out right at first...
you've still got to believe.
I kept believing.
You were right, Mommy!
Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus!
Where are you going?
To see if there's a swing!
There is one! There is one!
You told her that?
The sign outside
said it's for sale.
We can't let her down.
I never really doubted you.
It was just
my silly common sense.
It even makes sense
to believe in me now.
I must be a pretty good lawyer.
I take a little old man...
and legally prove
that he's Santa Claus.
Now, you know that...
Oh, no. It can't be.
It must have been left
by the people that moved out.
Maybe.
Maybe I didn't do such
a wonderful thing after all.
