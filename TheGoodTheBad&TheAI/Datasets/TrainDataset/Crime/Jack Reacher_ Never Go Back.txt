Jack Reacher Never Go Back
Pardon me. excuse me, step aside please.
Jesus Christ!
Lee's Diner.
There are four down. I'll need two MS vehicles.
What the hell happened here?
Somebody run 'em over?
Nah, man.
It was a fight.
One guy took them all out in like seconds.
He's still in there.
That's him.
Turn around, mister.
Let me see your hands.
Slowly.
Military ID. Expired.
$38 bucks.
And a toothbrush.
And no home address.
In other words, homeless.
Aggravated assault is a second-degree felony in
this state, Mr ...
Reacher. First name Jack. No middle name.
You're looking at 10 to 20 years, once thse boys
you beat out there are fit to testify.
Process him. Get him to County.
Two things are going to happen in the next 90
seconds.
Excuse me?
First,
that phone over there's going to ring.
Second,
you're going to be wearing these cuffs on your
way to prison.
Hahahehe, that is one magnificent prophecy, Mr.
Reacher.
That'll be a Major Turner of the 110th CID Police
in Alexandria, Virginia.
You and those boys out there wade a mistake,
operating on land owned by the US Army.
What are you talking about?
Kidnapping illegals.
Selling ​​them.
MP's are on the way now.
If it were up to me, I'd just kill you.
Just going to keep on ringing.
Sherif Raymond Wood.
Who the hell are you?
The guy you didn't count on.
Thank you.
United States Army 110, Sergeant Leach.
Major Turner, please.
One moment please.
This is Turner.
Major S. Turner?
This is she. Who am I speaking to?
Jack Reacher.
No kidding?
Well it's nice to finally speak.
Thanks for tipping us off to that sheriff.
You know, I ...
I wanted to thank you for helping me.
Out of a tight spot, huh?
Isn't that what army folks do for each other,
Major?
ex Major.
Oh, once a Major always a Major.
Where are you calling from?
Uh, outside Independence I think.
You're not sure?
It doesn't really matter, I move around a lot.
So I've heard.
What else have you heard?
Oh, come on, you're a legend around here.
Some folks still wonder why you left.
Let's say I ...
woke up one morning and the uniform didn't fit.
US Army, 110, Sergeant Leach.
Jack Reacher for Major Turner.
Hold on, Major.
Reacher.
How's my office?
I'm sitting here now.
You know, there is this big dent in the desk.
And people say you made with someone's head.
Is that true?
It was not my finest hour.
You're not in trouble again, are you?
I'm afraid you have a way of finding it.
Or...
looking for it.
You know, I was thinking maybe I owe you dinner
for what you did.
Oh, dinner well it took you a while to come to
that conclusion.
When are you coming to DC?
I'll get there eventually.
Well then I won't hold my breath.
You're not saying anything.
I'm deciding whether I'd like you in person.
Which way are you leaning.
On the fence.
I'm not sure you can handle me.
I'm not worried.
oh, worry ...
just a little.
Take care of yourself, Reacher.
Jack Reacher, for Major Turner.
Major Reacher.
Sergeant Leach, we've spoken on the phone.
Welcome back.
Just Reacher.
I'm a civilian now.
Yes Sir.
I'll take you up.
I'm sorry, I was looking...
Come in, Major.
Sam Morgan.
Please come in. Come in.
Have a seat.
I've heard a lot about you.
Stopping by to see Major Turner.
Oh, well, that's a problem.
Major Turner has been relieved of her command.
I spoke with her a few days ago.
She's been arrested.
Court martial's pending.
On what charge?
Espionage.
I'm assuming her duties until a replacement is
assigned.
Is there something I can help you with?
No. Just a personal visit.
You know each other from back when you we're C.O.
here?
Nope. Never met her.
I'm sorry to give you the bad news, Major.
ex Major.
Sir, I wanted to warn you.
But?
Ordered not to.
Colonel Morgan, directly.
Maybe you should warn me now.
Speak freely Sergeant.
Major Turner is an excellent officer, sir.
Has she been assigned an attorney yet?
Ordered not to give out any information about
that, sir.
Understood.
Always follow orders, Sergeant.
Yes, Sir.
Just curious, who was your DI in boot camp?
Sergeant Green, sir.
Well, let's say, if Sergeant Green were having
legal troubles.
Would you be able to recommend an attorney for
him?
Oh.
Yes.
Definitely I'd recommend Colonel Moorcroft over
at Fort Dyer, for the highest security person you
can find, sir.
Colonel.
You're the assigned counsel for Major Susan
Turner.
I'm Jack Reacher.
Former Commander of the 110th.
I was wondering when you were going to show up.
Major Turner requested under no circumstances are
you to be granted visitation privileges.
Why would she say that?
Maybe she read your file.
Anti-authority, anti-social, anti lawyer,
deadbeat dad?
Excuse me?
Says here you never paid child support.
I'm not a father.
Well, a woman named Candice Dutton begs to differ.
She contacted the army seeking compensation for
her daughter.
Samantha Dutton, she's 15 now.
This is a mistake.
They usually are.
Mother's got two priors, prostitution, possession.
The kid's been in and out of foster care her
whole life.
Any feelings anything about that?
About foster care?
Life sucks.
I meant the kid.
I don't have a kid. I've never heard of Candice
Dutton.
I'm here about Major Turner.
What evidence do they have?
A hard drive.
Containing classified information that was found
at Major Turner's residence.
The inference being she's selling secrets.
And that's it?
What do you want? A picture of her wearing a
burka and having drinks with the Taliban?
What did she tell you?
Can't talk to her until tomorrow.
Public safety exception.
And you accepted that?
Where did you get your law degree?
Oh...
It's possible you were once a good lawyer,
Colonel.
But what I see is a tired lifer who'd do anything
not to endanger his pension.
Let me know when you remember what that uniform
stands for.
Thanks.
How long we supposed to do this, I'm getting
hungry.
Just be patient.
What do you think he's eating?
Shut up.
New gun?
Yup.
ah, it's nice.
It makes your hands look big.
ah, You don't like big hands?
haha, put one of these in your face in a minute
you carry on.
Everything will be alright.
hey, hey, Where did he go?
I don't know, maybe he went to the pisser.
You're supposed to be watching him.
What do you think I have eyes in the back of me
head?
How's it going?
Don't!
Show me.
Throw it in back.
I don't like being followed.
I don't like being followed.
On the sidewalk before.
And then the market.
You're a little thief.
You a cop?
I look like a cop?
Narc maybe.
You know a lot of narcs.
It's the hair cut.
thanks.
I did it myself.
So you're looking for something weird.
See ya.
Are you Candice Dutton's daughter?
What'd she do this time?
Nothing.
I'm an old friend.
Yeah?
Well, she's not into doing that kind of thing
anymore.
That's not what I meant.
If you're looking for my mom, I don't live with
her.
Who do you live with?
You were right, Major.
I am tired.
But I'm not stupid.
Seargants Mirkovich and Cibelli.
Afghanistan on an investigation.
And they file reports daily.
airbase.
Shot at close range.
The next day Major Turner's thrown in prison.
What do you know about Parasource?
Parasource?
It is...
a big military contractor.
Why?
I don't know how they're involved in all this,
but they've been following me since I got here ..
Whoever killed Mirkovich and Cibelli, wanting
Major Turner isolated.
I think they're going to kill her too.
What are you talking about? You have no idea if
any of these things are connected.
- We have to get her out. - And might I reiterate
she does not want you involved
Do it now. I'll call you tonight.
People question the value of enhanced
interrogation techniques.
Enhanced interrogation techniques don't work.
Torture on the other hand, works very well.
No..
Attorney client privilege goes back to the
earliest days of English common law.
It means, that Major Turner told you in
confidence.
A great deal about what she learned from her
investigation in Afghanistan.
How much do you tell Jack Reacher?
No..
We didn't talk about that ..
Of course you did.
No..
We talked for 10... 10 minutes.
As you're about to learn.
- No ..
Jack Reacher? Colonel Morgan was wondering if you
had a few minutes.
You don't remember me do you?
Anthony Espin.
Well, you were still C.O. when I got here.
Held back my promotion for 6 months.
Why'd I do that? Cause you were hard ass person
said I jumped to conclusions  1821  I'm sure I
jumped to conclusions 1824
Have a seat.
You're under no obligation to say anything Major.
ex Major.
Upon leaving yesterday, did you attempt to
contact Major Turner?
Did you confront her attorney Col. Moorcroft at
Fort Dyer at 1100?
You told me not to say anything.
I said you didn't have to say anything.
Yes.
Yes, you confronted him?
Yes I understand I don't have to say anything.
For the record, you did confront Colonel
Moorcroft yesterday.
Can you state your whereabouts lastnight between
Yes.
Yes, what?
Yes I understand I don't have to say anything.
Note for the record the Major has an injury to
his hand not present during yesterdays meeting.
We're done here.
At approximately 0230 this morning Colonel
Archibald Moorcroft was beaten to death.
You're my attorney?
Lt. Sullivan.
- How do you you? - You are hereby charged for
the murder of a Judge Advocate General.
- Where was he killed? - In his apartment.
- Off base? - Yes.
This is a civilian matter.
As a private citizen the army has no
jurisdiction, turn me over to the DC police.
You're familiar with article 10.75 of the
military code?
An officer with your security clearance remains
subject to recall in event of emergency.
You agreed to it when you signed your discharge.
Welcome back to the Army, Major.
You're under arrest.
Open BA211.
Stand here, don't move.
Pass for prisoner transfer.
I'll file for disclosure.
They'll tun over whatever evidence they have on
you.
There won't be any evidence.
What are you talking about?
They killed their investigators, they killed
their lawyer.
- Evidence suggests you killed Major Turner's
lawyer. - They're going to kill her.
And they're going to kill me, and as far as I
know, you're part of it.
Listen dickhead, you're the one accused of a
murder.
Want to show me one shred of evidence?
I'll defend you to kingdom come, otherwise go to
hell.
I apologize, I have low blood sugar.
Excuse me?
I didn't eat this morning.
I feel light headed.
Can you get me something from the officers mess?
Sandwich maybe.
Open the door please.
***We're done here
Move.
Open BA201.
Mam, these men are here to transfer you.
Who are they?
I asked you a question, who are they?
Are you going to answer me?
Reacher? What is this?
Hold!
- We gotta get out of here. - What?
They killed Moorcroft.
- Wait, what? - Last night, in his apartment.
And now they're going to kill you.
Soldier, you know who I am? I need you to stand
down.
- You've been relieved of command mamm. - There
is no more time.
I want to know who told you ..
That soldier was under my command.
We don't have time for this.
Get his bags and his papers.
I left explicit orders for you to stay away.
- Orders? You ordered me? - Yes, I knew you'd do
something like this.
Don't make me regret it.
Espin? What did you do to him?
He'll be fine.
- This is insane. - Does this mean dinner's off?
- Act angry .. - I am angry.
- Prisoner transfer. - Lieutenant Sullivan come
in.
Open BA211.
- Hey wait a second .. - Move!
Get the keys, give me his keys.
- What kind of car would my lawyer be driving? -
Black sedan.
Damn ..
- Hurry up now, let's go!
- Survey the perimeter. - Secure the service lot.
- Move! Move! Quick! - Let's go!
Food truck.
- Move! - Move in!
Secure!
They're in the food truck! Stop that truck! Go!
Go! Go!
- Go! Go! - Move!
- Out of the truck! - Hands up now! - Get them
out of that truck.
Open!
Clear!
So now I'm a fugitive from justice.
And a traitor to your country, don't forget that.
Why do I feel like you're enjoying this?
You have a very interesting way of saying thank
you.
Were those men really going to kill me?
Thank you.
nice job.
oh his ass is mine. XO, one of our vehicles has
been hijacked, L67.
All units suspects travelling MP vehicle L67.
Primary is Jack Reacher, white male who is
considered armed and dangerous.
Secondary is Major Susan Turner, female wearing
military fatigues, white, age 34.
- Really? - Shut up.
We need to ditch this car and get into my email.
Alright people, lets go lets go. Where the hell
are they?
Specialist have the state troopers called back
yet?.
- On it Sir. - Alright has anybody heard from the
capitol police?
Anybody? Anything, A location something?
Is there still an internet cafe around here?
-  Pennsylvania and North Street. - Take us there
please.
Should have gone to Afghanistan myself.
Merkovich and Cibelli were my responsibility.
The job is about giving orders.
Did you ever lose anyone on your watch Reacher?
My men were't killed by the Taliban.
They were shot in the back of his head, with
slugs from an army issue 9mm.
By one of our own.
I'm going to find out who did it.
What are your guy's doing over there? What are
they looking for?
Weapons.
Dozens of weapons decommissioned during the draw
down.
Whole plane loads gone missing.
Hey, I like your hat.
- You Nat's fan - Yeah, from the beginning.
They arrested me the day after my investigators
were killed.
The time difference, they might have filed
another report.
They locked me up so I wouldn't see it.
Sir, she is trying to access the system.
- Get me that location. - Yes, Sir.
Pensylvania and North Street.
It's Morgan, ready to go to work soldier?
We've located them..
They're at an internet cafe at Pennsylvania and
North Street.
Get it done.
Whatever Merkovich and Cibelli found out got them
killed.
But by who?
Shit, they locked me out.
- They can find you like this. - Yes I know, just
give me a second, ok?
- They will know this location. - I need a
minute. - They will know this location. Shit,
lets get.
There is a bus stop on the other side of the park.
We're being followed, it's not a cop.
He's a pro.
Where?
Black coat, brown hair.
There.
- They made us? - Maybe.
Restaurant.
- Hello. - Meeting someone in the back.
- Everybody out! - Lets go!
- Out! Move!
Come on, lets go, get out!
I got this door.
Stay back, Stay back!
Police! Freeze!
Drop your weapon!
- Sir, I said drop your weapon! - I'm military
police!
He's not a cop.
Sir, drop your weapon.
- I'm military police. - Sir, I need you to drop
your weapon.
Listen, I know I know what this looks like, I
know - turn around and let me see your hands on
your head!
I know, I'm putting that weapon down.
Listen to me, I'm military police, these two are
fugitives of the United States Army.
- Sir, Sir get your hands behind your head. - I
understand, all right I'm turning around, I'm
turning around.
Place your hands behind your head.
- Now. - My identification's in my right front
pocket.
Will you just check it. Just check it.
Need you to back up, come on! Out of the streets
please! Go, go, go!
We got our signals crossed.
He's good.
We'll get him next time.
Now I admit being a little jealous when we talk.
Go wherer you want, eat when you want.
Nobody telling you what to do or how to do it.
Definitely not the army way.
Exactly.
Take a look at that registration.
Parasource. You think that guy in the kitchen was
one of theirs?
Free lance, is my guess.
Go.
You made a mess I hear.
This Reacher guy, is interesting.
You have no idea, we ran out of medals, so don't
make this a competition.
- Too late. - Sure you can handle him by yourself?
I can handle him just fine.
Prove it.
- Coffee? - Cream?
No.
Right sizes.
Good eye.
Spent the rest of our cash.
It's time we stopped running and start hunting.
- Morgan. - Catch you at a bad time?
I hope you're calling to turn yourselves in.
I don't know your role in this yet but I'm
guessing money, I promise you I will find out.
Nobody's going to find anything.
Not even in Major Turner's e-mail?
- Find it yet? - Nothing to find.
Check out looking hard enough looking.
Why don't we check my field reports?
Snap the tendon before it breaks the bone, takes
longer to heal.
Locked,  need the code. - 12.1.9.#
Merkovich and Cibelli's field reports.
What else we got on here, huh?
You think you're invulnerable?
Almost done uploading.
There are ways to get at you Reacher.
Got it.
Thanks for all your help.
Okay, Merkovich and Cibelli did file a final
report.
Orlars .. okay, here we go.
Last one they spoke to was a contractor named
Daniel Prudhomme.
He oversaw weapons transports, said he was
evasive and he disappeared.
This is Leach.
This is Sergeant Green, your old DI, do you
remember me?
Sergeant Green, so good to hear from you.
I'm here with a friend of yours, we need a favor.
There's a military contractor called ParaSource,
think you could ask around find out what role
they played in Bagram?
I might be able to do that.
Also there's a ParaSource employee named
Prudhomme, we need his whereabouts.
Prudhomme, copy that.
- And sergeant, carefully. - Sir, Yes Sir.
Reacher.
Clear.
Reacher.
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Hey, hey hey!
Okay, it's okay.
???
ok, you said you're not a cop?
I'm not.
- what's Military police? - That's different.
But you stole this car.
- It's complicated. - Where are you taking me?
We don't know yet.
- Do you have a phone? - Why?
- Give it to me. - I left it in the apartment
wher you kidnapped me.
We didn't kidnap you.
Kidnapping is a federal offense.
Look at me kid.
There are people out there who want to hurt you.
I feel sick.
Put your head out the window
It doesn't open.
- When was te last time you had something to eat?
- I don't know.
We need to get her some food.
- How long have you been drawing? - I don't know
why?
Just asking.
They suck.
Whatever you say.
How can they hurt those two nice old hippies,
who'd want to kill them.
You've had a shock.
Your body's pumping adrenaline cortisol, they
call it fight or flight.
It's going to take a while to calm down.
I can't eat. I'm pumping adrenaline.
I know a place you'll be safe.
What does that mean?
I'm not going to a stupid school.
They have a dress code, this is what they wear
there.
I know the head mistress, you'll be safe there.
Head mistress, what is it, a convent?
Do you want to live? Do you?
Yes.
Then you will go where we say and stay until we
say it's safe. Do you understand?
You're very intense you know that. Yeh, I
understand.
- What are you doing here? - Reacher has the girl.
You were supposed to take care of that.
You people, you take off the uniform and lose all
discipline.
How did he find her?
Exactly.
- How did he? - How would I know?
When he here earlier today?
You're watching me now? Who the hell do you think
you are?
- What did you give them? - What are you talking
about?
What did you give them?
I don't have to be interrogated by the likes of
you.
He came in here with that bitch and threatened
me, I give him nothing.
What's so funny. We hired you to clean up this
mess.
You're right.
- He touched this phone didn't he? - So?
That means his prints are on it.
I mean really, if I, if I had any other choice,
should only be for a few days.
You know how we feel about you here, look Susan.
- Thank you. - So nice to see you.
Good to see you too ..
- Welcome to Pembrooke - Hi, I'm Olivia. - and
I'm May.
- Carla. - Come sit with us.
- Where'd you go before this? - Different places.
ooh that looks really good for college
applications.
- Have you taken the PSAT's yet? - You can sign
up right away.
May, oh my god they're earrings, where'd you get
them?
Oh thank you, actually my dad brought them back
from New York.
my parents promised me some intense retail
therapy when we're in Paris for christmas.
- wow, Paris. -  - It's beautiful ..
could he ?? christmas. - he's cool, - I could tell him.
- What are you doing? - You said you didn't have
a phone.
- How many times you use this? - In my life?
Let's go, get your things.
What, just one person?
Excuse me, we have to go.
- Thank you. - Excuse me a moment.
Hey, what the hell is going on?
- She was texting. Shit. - What's wrong with that?
They can trace us.
Come on, lets go.
Get in.
God that place was ridiculous.
That place changed my life.
Sorry about the phone.
Go. - I did some digging about ParaSource.
Some of their boys got into trouble in
Afghanistan.
And lost some big government contracts word is
their in financial trouble.
Why does he get to have a phone?
- Daniel Prudhomme. - You need to be quiet.
Okay, sorry. Daniel Prudhomme. Keep going.
The contractor her guys talked to.
He lives in New Orleans.
He disappeared right after he was interrogated. Hitched a ride back home to his wife and kids
New Orleans is Parasource's home base. They know he's back and their looking for him.
- We're going to New Orleans. - Sir, something
else. - Yes?
Colonel Morgan was killed.
Your prints were found on the murder weapon.
I appreciate your help, sergeant.
We need to find Prudhomme before Parasource gets
a hold of him.
There's an airport at Norfolk.
- We need credit cards. - And ID's.
American Express?
Visa? Discovery?
Daddy is so happy with my SAT's and
extracurricular activity.
He's taking us all to New Orleans.
Unless you want me to shut up!
You little shit.
Sure about this?
- No. - Want me to do?
No.
Tan jacket.
Yeah.
- Sorry excuse me. - No problem.
Enjoy the flight.
Your seat is in an emergency exit row.
Please review the responsibilities for
the emergency exit seating ...
..on the back of the safety information card
located in the pocket in front of you.
Haven't flown before?
uh.
Here.
- You're kidding. - Don't want you puking on me.
I'm not going to puke.
Good.
So, how long have you been in the army for?
- oh, 10 years. - Oh wow.
- What's your rank? - Major.
So, if you give a guy orders?
He has to obey? Like fast?
Yeah.
And if he tries messing with you, you know like,
all kinds of moves, right?
- a few. - that's badass.
could I learn some?
Sure.
- You're not married, right? - No.
Are you gay? I'ts totally cool, I know tons of
lesbians.
No. I'm not gay.
I thought all lady soldiers are gay.
Well, some are. Some aren't. Like out in the real
world.
So, is Reacher your boyfriend?
No. - Friends with benefits.
- And no. - You mean no, you don't want to.
Or, no he doesn't want to, or no not yet, you
guys haven't really.
Alright, I see how it is.
My dad was military.
Really?
Never met him.
He left before I was born.
Where was he stationed?
Around DC, I guess.
What was his name?
- Candy won't talk about him. - Candy? - My mom.
- Oh.
Just says he was a big hero, and a total asshole.
We're beginning our descent so if you
need to use the lavatory you should do it now.
I'll be right back.
It's the haircut.
All you contractors go to the same barber?
Check it?
Oh, he's not feeling well. You might want to use
this one.
Go.
Took 2 more of your pieces off the board.
They were the B team.
Who are you, JSOC? SEAL team?
Something like that.
When'd you get back?
I'm not sure I ever did.
Don't you miss it?
- Not a bit. - I think you do, drifter.
People like us.
We can never go back to the world.
We hurt people.
And the people around us get hurt.
Leave Turner to me. Walk away now, and I won't
hurt the little girl.
You coming to New Orleans?
I'm thinking about it.
- Look me up. - I will.
Go! Go!
- Here. - Go, go, go!
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait!
F REE SUB
U'RANG B'ANGKA , JA'NGEN M'ELI SU'B PI'LM NE
DA USAH MAYAR
No!
Now, you're going to tell me what's going on.
Or the first chance I get, I'm going to scream ...
or grab a policeman!
- Okay, look. - We're protecting you.
- I found out that .. - Look you don't ..
- Can you stop? - Just ..
- Some people were stealing from the government.
- Stealing what?
- At this point, the less you know, the better. -
Bullshit!
I got us the credit card, okay? You wouldn't have
even gotten on that plane without it.
They're after me too.
Why?
You need to tell her.
They think you're my daughter.
Haha ha
That's funny.
- You're not my father. - How do you know?
Well, why would you think you are?
Because your mother filed a paternity suit with
the Army claiming I was.
All we have available is a lovely 2 bedroom
suite. 350 dollars a night, will that do.
Yes, can I pay with cash?
So are you going to take a DNA test?
Little busy right now.
I got to tell you something.
You're going to get angry.
This whole thing is my fault.
How is that?
I was the one who made her file the paternity
thing.
Thought maybe she could get something out of it.
Money, child support. Help her get her life
together.
She's doing better since she got out.
Got a job.
Wish she could get a little house.
You mad.
You can see it in your face.
- I am not mad. - Yes you are.
You think I'm your kid so you have to worry about
protecting me.
Yeah.
- So? - So, I don't want to be here.
So you don't want me here. So I should just leave.
Okay. Where are you going to go?
Oh my God.
Yes, understood. You're messing with me.
- And I just .. food. it's just .. - I'm sorry.
- Oh, God. - Thank you.
- Im starving. thanks. - Yes.
She's out.
Our dinner date.
The champagne is still chilling.
I knew you we're the romantic type.
... sure after those phone calls. What exactly
did you think would happen?
I thought, a nice dinner. Maybe some wine.
And, ... after dinner?
Back to your place. Right?
As opposed to your seedy motel.
Never underestimate the charm of a seedy motel.
I could see the appeal.
What do you say we look for a seedy motels after
I find Prudhomme?
I'll go with you.
Only one of us should go.
So I'll go.
No, somebody needs to stay here with her.
What? Because I'm a woman? I should be the
babysitter?
I don't know how to be the babysitter.
- You think that I do? - Yes.
You know I have had to put up with this crap my
entire career ..
forget the dickheads who think that they can paw
me, it's every male officer.. - hey excuse me, -
who thinks that he's smarter...
- hey you've been relieved of command.. - tougher
and more capable than I am. - Hey I was the
commanding.. -And the last I've heard..
- officer here. - you are a fugitive from
military justice. - So are you.
So we're both criminals.
I'm going.
Its a bad idea Major.
thank you.
Mrs. Prudhomme.
Look. I told you people I don't know where he is.
Okay?
- Miss Prudhomme. I'm an MP. - He's done with all
of that.
It's for his own protection.
He needs my help.
Yeah, well. He needs all the help he can get...
- for damn sure. - Does he have any friends?
Places? Places he hangs out.
Any place there's dope is where?
Do you have a photo?
Yeah.
Can burn it for all I care. -
You followed me in here.
That was a mistake.
And you didn't think we were watching the wife.
That was a mistake.
Maybe...
So how do you want to do this?
How about one at a time? I get a baseball bat.
Where's Turner?
Really?
If you were going to kill me, you would have done
it by now.
No we're not going to kill you. Not until you beg
for it.
And you're going to beg.
Left or right?
Turner's going to call me in 2 minutes.
If I don't answer, if I don't pick up.
If I sound distressed, she's in the wind.
You're bluffing.
Go for it.
Now tou're wondering how tou're going to make me
talk without tipping her off.
You can't torture me. You can't kill me.
And you're definitely going to have to kill me.
Give me the phone... Wait!
Toss it over.
Fella's...
I told you people I don't like being followed.
You're good, Jack!
Killing you isn't going to be enough though.
So I'm going to take back my promise about not
hurting the little girl.
Never going to happen.
Sure it is.
One day, she'll be walking home from school.
Or she'll be out on a date, or hanging out with
her friends.
And you won't be there to protect her.
Okay, let's try it again. This time I want you to
take the gun and hold it lower.
in your chest. Okay you're holding it way too
high. Okay, so grab it, yep bring it low, that's
right now step out and rotate. Right, good.
Hi Reacher.
check this out.
- Ready? - Yes.
grab ...
- Good. - yeah?
What do you think?
Trust me, If all you have left is that move. Just
assume you're dead already.
That's good. Let's try again...
we're going to add a kick to the balls into it,
okay?
Welcome to New Orleans Captain. I'm Lieutenant
Kudrow.
We're here to help any way we can.
What do you have for me?
Guys on the plane were ex-military. Hit pretty
bad.
- Do we know who they were working for? - They
claim to be unemployed.
Yeah, right.
I want their bank records, service records,
foreign travel, gun registrations, car
registration.
how they like their eggs, their favorite flavor
of ice cream. And I want it yesterday.
Sir, Yes Sir!
Is she asleep?
I spoke to Prudhomme's wife.
Turns out he's a junkie.
She didn't know where he was.
But she gave me a photo.
Are you more upset that I treated you like a
woman?
Or that I treated you like a man?
I am upset because I didn't deck you.
I should have been the one to go talk to him. I
can handle myself.
- I would have done better. - Maybe.
I appreciate the apology.
Is it really so important that you make every
decision? - Oh god you're such a dick.
Okay, I ...
I'm used to working alone, okay?
I'm used to being alone.
- Obviously. - I'm trying to apologize.
Well, go on.
What do you think we should do?
- Don't patronize me, okay? - I'm asking your
opinion.
- Well we could go to the VA. - Which is the
first place ParaSource will look.
- How about the local MP's? - They'll arrest us
in a heartbeat.
Okay, what is your plan then, Reacher?
See you don't know what to do?
You're like something feral, you've got their
scent in your nose and all you want is blood!
You still don't get it, do you?
They killed my men, took away my job, my life.
I don't want them as bad as you. I want them more.
Would you go see if she's up. Should get some
breakfast and figure out the next move.
- What'll we do with the kid? - The kid has a
name.
I know that.
- Why are you so tough on her? - It's a hard
world.
Sooner she knows it the better.
You don't think she knows that already?
Reacher, what if she is yours?
Then I should have been there 15 years ago.
Sam? Oh, god
- No, she's not here. - I'll get dressed. - And
go where?
Did she say anything to you?
She said she should leave.
- Whats up? - Where were you?
- Out. - Are you crazy?
- I was just trying to help. - How were you going
to help, huh?
- You guys said Prudhomme's a junkie. - We never
told you.
I heard you guys talking.
Some dude on the street said there's a place on
the 9th ward where homeless guys hang out.
Some old warehouse. People talk to me. It's a
thing.
- Do you know have any idea how dangerous that
was? - I told you I can take care of myself!
They are looking for us.
I just pick out the alpha guy.
- And he's supposed to protect you? - No, I give
him shit.
Strong guys don't hurt you. The weak guys do that.
Strong guys always have little sisters or they
want one.
I don't know why, that's just a how it is.
I'm really tired.
I can't do this.
That was really stupid.
I know.
Please don't ever do that again.
Your welcome.
Hey.
Let's go find Prudhomme.
- Excuse me sir can
you look at this picture please?
Well folks call it the 9th circle of hell.
- If he's a vet. That's where he's going to be. -
Thank you.
I have money for Daniel Prudhomme.
- How much? - More than he needs.
- well how much? - You know Prudhomme?
- that depends. - It's a simple question.
What do you want with him?
I told you, I want to give him money.
You are Danny Prudhomme, right?
Specialist Daniel Prudhomme.
- Yes, I am. - Do you work for ParaSource?
The day you spoke to two Seargants, Merkovich and
Cibelli.
They interviewed you in Bagram.
No, I never heard of them.
Seargants Merkovich and Cibelli. Merkovich had a
Cibelli's wife is pregnant with their first. Now
tell me what happened?
They'll kill me.
She'll kill you.
No we'll protect you. You have to tell us all of
it.
ParaSource is running truck convoys out of Bagram.
We just ran security for the base. All I had to
do was just lie and say all the weapons were
accounted for.
They gave me a shitload of money to keep my mouth
shut.
We're leaving enough shit over there to start
another war.
ParaSource was selling off the weapons instead of
bringing them back to the States.
- What went wrong? - Warlords want to renegotiate.
ParaSource says no.
The next day, we're driving through those poppy
fields.
- The whole convoy just gets lit up!
I was scared shitless.
Army had to send in a search and rescue.
What happened after you gave your statement?
Nothing, I told them everything.
There was this guy he worked for ParaSource, he
told me not to worry.
That he'll take care of everything.
Next thing I know, I hear they'd been killed.
I went AWOL ...
hitched a ride back to the States.
I was a dead man if I stayed.
I uh..
I started shooting up over there.
yjought if I could just get myself home, you know
...
I'd get myself right.
But you didn't.
No.
There's more shit in the streets of New Orleans
than they're making in Afghanistan.
Something's wrong.
- Numbers don't add up. - What do you mean?
Why put huge government contracts at risk selling
US Army weapons on the black market?
- ParaSource is smarter than that. - Yeah their
smart alright.
What about our end didn't anybody check to see
the crates are empty?
Probably just some dumb guy like me.
We need to get inside one of those transports.
A plane leaves Bagram every Friday at 0600 hours.
get home.
Jesus that's 10 o'clock tonight.
And that was without the hot sauce.
- haha, now you got to tell me that was worth it,
sir. - oh Hey, hey where you at chief?
- ooh You know you're one fine mofellata - No,
no. thank you maam.
- wait a minute now don't go depriving a poor
girl a taste now. - I don't have no money, I have
no money.
Not today darling. - Okay. - Not today. -  Well
it's his loss now.
- Go on now. - Alright.
- I have my wallet. - Yeah, I think you're good.
Alright, I got my wallet.
- You do it? - Just like we negotiated.
- Well. - It's done.
Make the call.
Is that you?
No sir, it's not me.
Who is this?
I have a witness who can exonerate me.
But he has to live first.
Why don't you, why don't you come in, we'll talk
about it.
Will you guarantee his safety.
You're not in charge anymore, Major.
Neither are you apparently, operatives have been
ahead of you this whole time.
Who are those guys on the plane, hm?
They tried to kill me in my cell.
Here's a name for you, Parasource.
Here's a couple more names to think about.
Baghdad, Bazra, this isn't our first rodeo is it
Captain.
You think I want to be in this position, maam?
I have a job to do, and I'm going to do it.
I'm going to take a leap of faith that you don't
have anything to do with this.
Look on the back of the phone, come alone and
make sure you're not tailed.
Kudrow to Espin.
- Kudrow to Espin. - This Espin, go.
We ID'd those boys on the plane. Paid by a shell
company out of the Cayman Islands.
- Traced the accounts back to a big military
contractor by the name of.. - Parasource.
Yeah. How'd you know that?
uh uh nevermind, get me everything you can on
Parasource, and I mean everything.
Look I'm enroute to pick up a witnesses.
We'll send backup.
No stand ready 2 minutes out and wait for my
signal.
That's not procedure, sir.
No, that's called an order. Reacher knows the
game, if he smells heat he'll bolt.
Alright we'll stay 2 minutes out. What's the
address?
Nicholls Street Wharf. Espin out.
Nicholls Street Wharf.
No witnesses.
Freeze!
Don't shoot. Don't shoot man, don't kill me.
Don't kill me. I, I'm, I'm here to help.
- You're the witnesses? - Yeah, yes, yeah I'm the
witness.
Where the hell are you?
Youe got what you need?
- Not good enough. - I suggest you listen to what
he has to say.
- I can help. - Okay. Let's go.
I like stories, tell me a story.
We'll return to our Halloween marathon.
Is your costume ready for tonights parade tonight?
- I'm going to call this in. - I'll cover.
Officer down. Nicholls Wharf.
I'm out.
- You're still wanted for murder. - That's right,
I'm a stoned killer.
So I saved you.
Did Prudhomme give you a statement?
Most of it.
Cibelli and Mirkovich were your friends.
Thats right.
Parasource ordered their murders.
They also just tried to kill you.
They've been providing insurgents with weapons.
Well you're going to need more proof than the
word of a dead junkie.
And you're going to help us get it.
Here. Put the cuffs on and take us into custody.
Just get us on yhe TARMAC at Parasource in 1 hour.
I need you to jump to a conclusion here, soldier.
Yes. thanks.
Okay, here's what we got.
contracts worth over a billion dollars.
They're bleeding cash, and the banks want blood.
And now, all of a sudden they start paying back
their creditors.
How much money can they really be making selling
weapons on the black market?
an M4 is what? 5 grand, a rocket launcher's half
that.
That's nothing compared to government contracts.
So where are they getting the money?
The receptionist, what can we help.
Hey, do you have room service?
We're sorry we did not serve with cash, we need a
credit card.
Uh, yes. Wait a minute.
Do you understand that there will be a parade and
it will take a lot of time.
Em, it's okay.
Eh, if a visa is not any?
Pak we have accurate directions with one stolen
credit card.
Hotel Daphine, 10-18 Royal Road.

been committed.
And you are.
Major Susan Turner 110th Military Police.
The, Major Turner who's wanted by the MP's for
espionage?
Do you mean these MP's?

belonging to the United States Army.
In fact you sold them to insurgents.
And these are now empty.
Do you know who I am, Major?
Yes. General. I do.
You're the man responsible for the deaths of two
of my men.
Now open up those crates.
Before I grab you by your hairplugs and bitch

AT-4 rocket launchers, sir.
Open it.

Open it.
Opening that one.
I said open up that crate!
Open it.
Lieutenant, do your goddamn job, and place this
goddamn woman under arrest.
Sorry Major.
You're going to need to come with me.
You're right.
The numbers don't add up.
Sir, sir.
Stop that man.
- Reacher. - Stop that man.
Stop him!
Take him down, now!
Breathe deep, son.
Pure opium.
Now the numbers add up.
Get him out of here.

She's not in the hotel. She's in the street.
How do you know?
Because that's what I would do.
I'll go this way.
- Did you see anything? We searched 3 more hote;s
and didn't find a trace of her, nothing. - Then
she's got to be hiding somewhere.
Reacher.
Lets finish this. Just you and me.
I'm going to have some fun with a pretty little
girl.
She's not my little girl.
Is that fear I hear in your voice, Jack?
I'm going to break your arms, I'm going to break
your legs, I'm going to break your neck.
What you hear is excitement.
Hey, you! Get out of there! Come on, right now.
Nice try, Jack. I found a way to hurt you like
you've never hurt before.
Samantha!
Do you have her?
Sutter Street, La Fitt hotel.

Can you walk?
Sure.
Take it easy.
Okay.
- Dude, you jumped off a building. - Yes I know.
- Does that hurts? - Yes.
- Did you see how high it was? - Can we possibly
have this conversation some other time?
Thank you.
You know, it's funny. You came looking for one
girl and you ended up with another.
Let me know how that goes.
I still got your number.
Bye, Reacher.
Major.
Good to see you back, Major.
Thank you, Captain.
Sorry. Bus got stuck in traffic.
New T-shirt.
Shut up.
Thanks for coming.
So, Reacher ..
Are you my father or not?
I guess we'll see when your mother gets here.
Sure you'd recognize her.
I tend to remember the women that I sleep with.
- who says she'll remember you. - Thanks a lot.
You're not my father.
Why do you say that?
See that woman over there?
The waitress who's refilled your coffee three
times.
That's her.
You never had any idea who ??? was.
I knew it all along.
No, you didn't.
I'm sure you're relieved.
Not really.
Just going to go.
