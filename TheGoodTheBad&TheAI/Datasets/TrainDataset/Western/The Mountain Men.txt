A SWIFT RUNNER ?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, RUN ?
IT WAS NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE.
THE COUNCIL OF ELDERS
ARE LIKE SQUAWS.
THE WHITE MAN'S MEDICINE
MAKES US WEAK.
WE DIE LIKE FLIES
AT FORT McKENZIE.
YOU MEAN THE POX ?
WE TRADE AT THE FORT,
AND OUR FACES ROT AND FALL OFF.
EVEN THE WOLVES
WILL NOT TOUCH US.
THIS IS STRANGE,
EVIL MEDICINE.
AND WE CAN DO NOTHING
ABOUT IT.
BUT YOU AND I ARE THE SAME.
A FEW PASSING SUNS
WILL SEE US NO MORE.
OUR BONES WILL BLEACH IN THE SUN
WITH THE BONES OF THE BUFFALO.
BUT WE SHALL BE REMEMBERED.
TOMORROW YOU'LL SEE
YOUR LAST SUNRISE.
WHERE IS RUNNING MOON ?
SHE IS DEAD.
RUN.
HE CANNOT BE FOUND.
YOU HUNT FOR HIM STILL ?
NO MAN CAN LIVE
IN THAT WATER.
NOT THE GROS VENTRE.
HE IS DEAD.
I SURVIVED.
WHEN HIS SCALP...
HANGS FROM MY LODGE,
WHEN HIS HEAD
SITS ON MY SPEAR,
THEN HE WILL BE DEAD.
IT WILL BE WINTER SOON.
RUNNING MOON, GO.
BRING US WOOD.
WE HAVE LITTLE TO EAT.
WE MUST MOVE
THE VILLAGE.
WHEN THE SNOW FALL,
IT WILL HIDE HIS TRACKS.
WE NEED NO TRACKS.
WE WILL MOVE THE VILLAGE
BEFORE THE SNOW COME.
THEN WE WILL HUNT.
THERE IS ONLY ONE PLACE
HE CAN SURVIVE THE WINTER--
IN THE VILLAGE OF IRON BELLY,
THE CROW.
GET !
GO ON !
YOU BLACK YOUR FACE
FOR A HUNT ?
FOR THIS HUNT.
CHRIST !
I AM DYING.
THERE IS NO MORE.
I AM HUNGRY TOO.
I AM MEDICINE WOLF.
I WILL NOT DIE LIKE A SLAVE.
MEDICINE WOLF !
YOU KNOW BILL TYLER ?
HE SPOKE OF YOU.
BILL TYLER IS MY FRIEND.
WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM ?
WAS HE NOT
IN YOUR VILLAGE ?
NO.

BEFORE THE WINTER.
MAYBE HE GO UNDER.
NO.
I KNOW THAT HE'S ALIVE.
MAYBE HE GO NORTH.
YELLOWSTONE COUNTRY.
MANY TRAPPERS WINTER
ON THE MADISON RIVER.
I AM TYLER'S WOMAN.
I WILL BRING YOU MORE.
WHAT THE HELL TOOK YOU,

SIT YOUR ASS DOWN
AND HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE.
OH.

LOOK HERE, HENRY.
IF I'D KNOWN THAT...
YOU WAS LAYING THERE SCALPED--
IF I'D KNOWED

NOT FOR NOTHING.
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL
ME THAT, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
I KNOW THAT.
WELL, I WAS LAYING THERE.
COME TO
ALL BY MY LONESOME.
THEM BLACKFEET WAS SO BUSY
TAKING OFF AFTER YOU,
THEY EVEN FORGOT
TO TAKE MY RIFLE.
I GOT BACK TO CAMP,
I SEEN YOU WAS GONE.
JUST WALKED
THE HELL OUT OF THERE.
TAKES A LOT MORE
THAN A SCALPIN' KNIFE
TO PUT THIS CHILD UNDER.
IT SURE MUST'VE
SMARTED SOME, THOUGH.
WELL, I GUESS.
ISN'T THAT THE SHITS ?
I'LL TELL YA,
IT FELT MIGHTY QUEERSOME.
MMM.  HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL
IS RUNNING MOON ?
SHE'S GONE UNDER, HENRY.
AND HEAVY EAGLE
STOVE HER HEAD IN.
OH, SHIT.
GODDAMN !
SHE WAS SOME PUMPKIN TOO.
WELL--
SAY, YOU EVER FIND
THAT VALLEY ?
THE ONE THAT'S ALWAYS SWARMIN'
WITH THE BEAVERS ?
WHERE THEY RUN UP ON THE BANKS
AND FIGHT ONE ANOTHER
TO GET IN YOUR TRAP ?
HOLLERIN',
"TAKE ME, BILL TYLER !
TAKE ME !"
BEAVER MANY
AS STARS IN THE SKY.
THERE'S AN OLD HORSE OUTSIDE.
WHAT ?
THERE'S AN OLD HORSE OUTSIDE.
YOU ARE ONLY A SLAVE.
THEY WILL NOT GO AFTER YOU.
FIND TYLER.
TELL HIM I WAIT.
GO.
BEFORE I GOT THERE,
HE HAD BURNED IT OUT.
KILLED THE OLD MAN
AND THE SQUAWS
AND THE YOUNG 'UNS TOO.
LEFT ME BETWEEN
A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE.
ALL I COULD DO WAS TRY
FOR THE FLATHEAD COUNTRIES,
SEE IF THEY'D TAKE ME IN.
I WORKED ACROSS
THE YELLOWSTONE.
YEAH, YOU GOT THE HAIR
OF THE BEAR ON YOU, TYLER,
THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE.
I'VE SEEN THE BACK DOOR
TO HELL, HENRY.
YEAH, LOOK THERE.
THERE SHE IS.
YOU LITTLE RASCAL.
GO ON, GET.
I TRADED
A GOOD PINTO FOR HER.
OF COURSE, I STOLE HIM
FROM HER PAPPY FIRST.
THE OLD SON OF A BITCH
HAS GOT SO GODDAMN MANY HORSES,
HE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIS OWN
WHEN I BRUNG HIM BACK.
SHE DON'T KNOW A DAMN WORD
OF ENGLISH, BUT SHE CAN BE
MIGHTY COMFORTING...
ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS ONE.
I DO MISS MY MULES, THOUGH.
HEY, TYLER.
WHERE'S YOUR SQUAW ?
OH, I KNOW.

GROS VENTRE BITCH.
BIG MELONS.
WHAT'D YOU PAY FOR HER ?
HUH ?
I BET SHE HUMP YOU

PORK-EATIN' FROG TURD !
I CAN'T STAND
THAT NASTY-TALKIN' BASTARD.
YOU KNOW, IT'S
GODDAMN LONESOME OUT HERE.
IT TOOK YOU
THAT ONE OUT, HUH ?
I'M GETTIN' LONG
IN THE TOOTH FOR THIS.
WELL, THAT AIN'T AN ELK.
I RECKON NOT.
NO PRESENTS NOW, TYLER,
YA HEAR ?
NO DAMN MEAT, EITHER.
WATCH YOURSELF, BILL,
GODDAMN IT.
HE'S LIABLE TO HAVE THE POX.
HE AIN'T GOT THE POX.
THE WHOLE TRIBE CAUGHT IT
OVER AT FORT UNION
LAST FALL, GODDAMN IT !
WHAT THE HELL--
I AM MEDICINE WOLF.
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE, DAMN IT.
WHAT HAPPENED ?
MEDICINE WOLF HUNTING.
THEY TAKE PRISONER.
ALL DIE.
H-H-HUNGRY.
YEAH.
YOU'LL EAT JUST AS SOON AS
WE GET YOU BACK TO CAMP.
HOW'D YOU GET AWAY ?
RUNNING MOON.
WHAT ?
RUNNING MOON.
SHE HELPED MEDICINE WOLF.
GIVE HORSE.
SHE SAYS--
SHE'S ALIVE ?
SHE-- SHE W--
SHE WAITS.
WHAT'D HE SAY ?
WHAT DID HE SAY ?
HE SAYS HE'S HUNGRY.
GOD.
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES.
TELL HIM WE AIN'T GOT
NO MEAT TO SPARE.
WE CAN'T GO FEEDIN'
EVERY STARVIN'-ASS INDIAN
COME WANDERIN' INTO CA--
OH, JESUS.
I DON'T RECKON
HE'LL EAT MUCH, HENRY.
YOU FELLAS EVER FIND
THAT VALLEY
YOU WAS HUNTIN' ?
THE ONE IRON BELLY
TOLD YOU ABOUT ?
THERE AIN'T NO VALLEY,
JOE.
I HEAR IRON BELLY
TELL YOU DIFFERENT, HUH ?
IRON BELLY'S AN OLD MAN.
HE WAS JUST YARNIN' ME.
IT DIDN'T MAKE
NO NEVER MIND TO HIM.
MAYBE-- MAYBE
HE TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
WHICH WAY MIGHT YOU
BE HEADIN' COME BREAKUP ?
NORTH.
DROP ON OVER
KICKIN' HORSE PASS,
TRAP THE WOLF.
MAYBE THE PEACE RIVER.
IT'S BRITISH TERRITORY.
HUDSON'S BAY AIN'T GONNA BE
TOO HAPPY TO HEAR YOU, UH,
TRAPPIN' THEIR GROUND.
IF THE BLACKFEET
COULDN'T LIFT MY HAIR,
I RECKON I CAN STAY AHEAD
OF THE BRITISHERS.
COYOTE ?
REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
WE SAW THE TETONS ?
STANDING TALL AND WHITE
AS A WOMAN'S BREAST.
THE WHOLE COUNTRY SO NEW,
IT MADE A MAN THINK...
HE WAS THE FIRST ONE
TO SET FOOT ON IT.
YOU COULD WALK FOR A YEAR
IN ANY DIRECTION
WITH JUST YOUR RIFLE.
LIVE GOOD AND EASY.
NEVER SAY "SIR" TO NOBODY.
WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND ?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT ?
I MEAN, RUNNING MOON
AIN'T DEAD, IS SHE ?
WELL, NO MORE
THAN I AM.
SO I DON'T RECKON YOU'RE HEADIN'
FOR NO PEACE RIVER, ARE YA ?
NO, SHE AIN'T DEAD.
THAT BASTARD HEAVY EAGLE
LIED TO ME.
- THERE AIN'T NO VALLEY, HENRY.
- I WASN'T THINKIN' ABOUT THAT.
THERE AIN'T NO BEAVER UP THERE,
GODDAMN IT !
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT NEED SOME HELP...
STEALIN' RUNNING MOON BACK,
THAT'S ALL.
I DON'T NEED NO HELP.
I DON'T RECKON
I NEED ANY HELP.
HEAVY EAGLE
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY ABOUT THAT.
MAYBE.
WELL, I WAS ONLY TRYIN'
TO HELP YOU,
YOU CONTRARY OLD FART.
I KNOW IT.
MMM.
GOOD LUCK TO YA.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU TOO,
HENRY.
WELL, SOMEBODY'S
GOTTA LOOK AFTER YOU.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SQUAW ?
AH, I TRADED HER BACK
TO HER PAPPY FOR THE PINTO.
YOU AIN'T RIDIN' HIM.
THE OLD FART
STOLE HIM BACK AGAIN.
GODDAMN THIEVIN' REDSKIN.
WHOA.
TYLER.
DIDN'T FIGURE ON
MEETIN' YOU TWO UP HERE.
WIND RIVER'S A LONG WAYS
FROM KICKIN' HORSE PASS.
I CHANGED MY MIND.
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.
YOU'RE FREE TRAPPERS.
YOU HUNT WHERE YOU WANT.
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
THERE AIN'T NO VALLEY UP HERE,
AND THERE AIN'T NO BEAVER.
NO ?
SO WHY YOU HERE, THEN ?
YOU BOYS ARE ON YOUR OWN HOOK.
STAY OUT OF MY WAY.
WHY ?
YOU FORSAKE YOUR PEOPLE.
I HAVE NO PEOPLE.
IAMTHE PEOPLE.
THEY WILL NOT DIE
WHILE I LIVE.
YOU CANNOT LEAVE,
RUNNING MOON.
HE WILL COME...
AS I DID.
AND HE WILL DIE.
THAT WASN'T HERE
THIS MORNIN'.
TWO, THREE HOURS OLD.
SIX, SEVEN OF 'EM.
WAR PARTY.
DON'T TRY TO TEACH ME
MY BUSINESS, HENRY.
TRAVELIN' TOO FAST
FOR HUNTERS.
MAYBE THEY WAS IN A HURRY.
WHERE IN THE HELL
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOIN' ?
CHURCH SOCIAL ?
YOU BEST GET BACK ON TO CAMP,
CHECK UP ON THEM TWO
CHEE-CHOPPERS.
I'LL SCOUT AROUND SOME.
THAT CRAP WALKER
DON'T COME IN BY NOW,
HE DON'T COME IN.
QUIT WORRYING.
YOU'VE BEEN OUT LONGER YOURSELF.
I THINK YOU ONE GODDAMN INJUN.
IF I WAS AN INJUN,
YOU'D BE DEAD.
I THOUGHT YOU WAS
HUNTIN' WITH WALKER.
OUI.
YOU BURY HIM.
BULLSHIT !
YOU'LL KILL US ALL, TYLER !
AND YOU'LL TAKE
ALL THE BEAVER
FOR YOURSELF !
MAYBE YOU KILL MY FRIEND.
THEN MAYBE YOU KILL ME, HUH ?
THAT AIN'T A BAD IDEA,
FROG ASS.
I SEEN THE VILLAGE, HENRY.
I GOT CLOSE ENOUGH
TO SPIT ON IT.
IS RUNNING MOON
UP THERE ?
IT'S NEAR EMPTY.
THE BRAVES ARE OUT HUNTIN' US.
ONLY A BUNCH OF OLD MEN
AND BOYS GUARDIN' IT.
IS RUNNING MOON UP THERE ?
SURE, SHE'S THERE.
WELL ?
FIGURED HOW TO GET HER
OUT OF THERE ?
WE WALK IN AND TAKE HER.
TAKE HER ?
CHRIST'S SAKES, TYLER.
"TAKE HER."
THE VILLAGE IS DOWN
AT THE END OF THAT VALLEY.
WE RIDE INTO THE VALLEY
FROM THE EAST,
THEN WE WORK UP A SIDE CANYON.
I KNOW THEY'RE WATCHING US
ALL THE TIME, SO I'M CERTAIN
THEY'LL GO AFTER US.
GO AFTER US ?  YOU TETCHED ?
JESUS CHRIST !
ONCE WE DRAW OFF
HEAVY EAGLE AND HIS BOYS,
WE PUT THE SNEAK ON 'EM.
WE WORK PAST 'EM
IN THE THICK COUNTRY...
AND WALK INTO THAT VILLAGE
AS SLICK AS YOU PLEASE.
WHO IN THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE MESSIN' WITH ?
THEM BOYS KILL FOR A LIVIN',
YOU KNOW.
NO.
BY THE TIME THEY GET WIND
OF WHERE WE'RE AT,
WE'LL BE LONG GONE.
HEY, WAKE UP,
YOU OLD FART.
LA BONT LIT OUT ON US,
DID HE ?
YEP.
TOOK THE PACK STOCK
WITH HIM TOO.

THE HORSES.

YOU OLD BASTARD !
WELL, IT'S NEVER YOUR TURN
TO GUARD THE GODDAMN HORSES !
EVERY GODDAMN TIME
WE LOSE THE HORSES,
OH, SHUT UP !
IT'S MY TURN TO GUARD 'EM,
AIN'T IT ?
YEAH, WELL,
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME
THE REES SNUCK OFF...
WITH OLD GABE'S MULES
DOWN ON THE BIG HORN, HUH ?
YOU WAS GUARDIN' THE STOCK.
I WAS GUARDIN' THE STOCK ?
BULLSHIT,

WHAT ABOUT THAT TIME
DOWN ON SIDSKIDEE WHEN
THE SIOUX JUMPED YOUR ASS ?

WHAT THE HELL ?
OH, BALLS !
HE'S LEADIN' 'EM
RIGHT BACK TO US !
ASSHOLE !

- WHERE THE HELL'S MY HORSES ?
WHAT YOU THINK ?
THE GODDAMN INDIANS GET 'EM.
WELL, WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU COME BACK HERE FOR,
YOU GODDAMN, IGNORANT,
FOREIGN GODDAMN SHITHEAD FROG ?
WHOA !
WE SURE PUT
THE SNEAK ON THEM.
YES, SIR.
SURE FOOLED 'EM.
"AIN'T NOBODY GUARDIN'
THIS VILLAGE."
YES, SIREE.
ALL WE GOT TO DO IS...
GIVE 'EM THE SLIP
IN THE THICK COUNTRY...
AND THEN WHIP RIGHT UP THERE
AND RESCUE
GOOD OLD RUNNING MOON...
SLICK AS YOU PLEASE.
YOU GOT ANY IDEAS ?
WELL,
MAYBE IF WE CAN
HOLD 'EM OFF TILL DARK.
GET OUR ASSES OUT OF HERE
AND UP TO THAT VILLAGE
BEFORE SUNUP.
'CAUSE YOU KNOW HEAVY EAGLE
AIN'T GONNA TRY TO
BUTCHER US UNTIL DAYBREAK.
BY THEN, WE COULD BE
HALFWAY TO YELLOWSTONE.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE WON'T BUTCHER US
AT NIGHT ?
BLACKFEET DON'T FIGHT AT NIGHT.
YOU KNOW THAT.
HENRY, YOU AIN'T GOT
THE BRAINS GOD GIVE GEESE.
HEY, WHAT YOU THINK ?
MAYBE WE MAKE DEAL ?
WE GIVE THEM HORSES,
THEY LET US GO, NO ?
I'VE BEEN DOWN
THAT TRAIL BEFORE.
HE WANTS PARLEY.
WE GIVE IT TO HIM, NO ?
YOU SUIT YOURSELF.
I GOT NOTHIN' TO SAY TO HIM.
HE'S WAY OUT OF RANGE.
I KNOW IT.
I JUST DON'T LIKE HIM.
DON'T MISS.
I NEVER MISS.
SAY, HENRY,
AIN'T NO NEED
FOR YOU TO FIGHT YOUR WAY
INTO THAT VILLAGE.
WE-WE COULD JOIN UP AFTER--
I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT THE TIME
THE 'RAPAHOS...
CHASED ME UP A CANYON
OVER IN THE BIG LOST ?
NO, BUT I RECKON
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME.
WELL, IT WAS OVER
ON THE HORSE PRAIRIE.
THIS BAND OF 'RAPAHOS
HAD BEEN CHASING ME THREE DAYS.
SO I SEEN THIS CANYON.
I FIGURED, WELL, I'LL WHIP
IN THERE, THEN I'LL SLIP OUT.
THE TROUBLE WAS THAT
THERE WAS A WAY IN BUT
THERE WASN'T NO WAY OUT AT ALL.
NOTHIN' BUT CLIFFS
HALF A MILE HIGH
ALL THE WAY AROUND.
A WHOLE DAMN TRIBE
OF BLACKFOOT DOWN THERE...
JUST MADDER THAN
TURPENTINE WILDCATS.
SO I HOLED UP
BEHIND SOME ROCKS,
BUT THAT DIDN'T DO NO GOOD...
BECAUSE THEY JUST
KEPT ON A-COMIN'.
ENTIRE SIOUX NATION.
ME OUT OF POWDER, OUT OF LEAD.
- I WAS ONE SCARED NIGGER.
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THEY WAS 'RAPAHO.
NO, GODDAMN IT !
THEY WAS PAWNEE.
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU ?
I GOT KILLED, OF COURSE.
SAY, DID YOU SEE ANYTHING
OF HEAVY EAGLE...
AFTER LA BONT GOT KILLED ?
RECKON NOT.
YOU'RE GETTIN' TOO OLD
FOR INJUN FIGHTIN', HENRY.
YOU'RE LOSIN' YOUR WIND.
YOU CALL THIS FIGHTIN' ?
JESUS.
I TOLD YOU YOU NEEDED SOMEBODY
TO LOOK AFTER YA.
YOU JUST LAY QUIET THERE
FOR A SPELL, AND
I'LL HAVE YA OUT OF HERE.
OH, BULLSHIT.

SON OF A BITCH !
WELL, WE TRAPPED A HEAP,
DIDN'T WE ?
THE COUNTRY WAS OURS
FOR THE TAKIN',
AND BY GOD,
WE REACHED OUT AND TOOK IT.
YEAH, THEM WAS
SHININ' TIMES.
YOU AND RUNNING MOON
GOTTA MOVE FAST.
GET THE HELL UP
IN THE HIGH COUNTRY.
INJUNS DON'T LIKE IT UP THERE.
YOU CAN HAVE MY PACK MULE.
YOU AIN'T GOT NO PACK MULE.
LOOK, DON'T TALK SO DAMN MUCH.
OH, CHRIST'S SAKES.
I'M BLEEDIN' TO DEATH.
I'M GONNA TALK ALL I DAMN WANT.
LISTEN, YOU--
YOU OLD SON OF A BITCH.
YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH.
THAT VALLEY'S UP THERE.
YOU AND RUNNING MOON FOUND IT,
DIDN'T YA ?
IT'S UP THERE, AIN'T IT ?
AIN'T IT ?
YEAH, HENRY.
YEAH, IT'S UP THERE.
A WHOLE VALLEY
FULL OF PRIME BEAVER.
A MAN COULD LIVE EASY
THE REST OF HIS DAYS.
WAS THEY LIKE STARS
IN THE SKY ?
YEAH.
DID THEY HOLLER,
"TAKE ME, TAKE ME" ?
LIKE IT WAS
IN THE ASHLEY DAYS...
WHEN WE WAS FREE TRAPPERS.
OH, GODDAMN IT !
GODDAMN YOU,
HENRY FRAPP !
