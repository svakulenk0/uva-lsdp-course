Dear Janey,
My younger days,
before you was born,
me and Bartle Bone and Jim Ragg
spent time as mule skinners
for General Custer.
We were used to hunting
and trapping in the Rockies,
so we didn't realise taking orders
would be so hard to stomach.
By that time, the silver had run out,
the railroads were coming
and everything was about to change.
But the adventures
weren't quite over yet.
Calam?
- Mule skinners, you say?
- Yes, sir.
Sure you ain't trappers?
Well, we were trappers, 25 years,
but no more.
Rockies all trapped out.
We're scouts, too.
We know every trail, creek, pond,
river between Colorado and Canada.
We hoped Custer would need scouts,
but seeing as those positions
have been filled by Bill Hickok
and a couple of Crow...
Seeing how them positions
done filled, we're mule skinners.
Yeah.
You don't look like much, fella.
Sure you can crack a bullwhip?
Here.
Forward!
In them days, Janey,
there was only two ways
for a woman to survive out West.
Wifing and whoring.
As I weren't cut out for either one,
I had to find my own way to survive.
So I lived like a man and sometimes
even passed myself off as one.
It got a little sticky at times,
but it gave me a kind of freedom
that few women ever knew.
Bill!
Bill Hickok!
Over here!
Well, if it isn't Calamity Jane.
Custer know
he's got a female bullwhacker?
Of course he don't.
Don't you go telling him.
Don't I always keep your secrets?
Where are you going?
You're supposed to be scouting.
I was about to hunt some fresh meat
when you tried to kill me.
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead.
What do you want?
All these years,
I never could quite figure you out.
You never will, Hickok.
Shoot.
Come on, girls.
Bull's-eye!
No beans tonight.
I think it was sickly.
Moving awful slow.
- Hogwash!
- I ain't eating it.
I ain't up to digesting
diseased animal.
Suit yourself.
I'm tired of biting your dust.
Chew on mine for a while.
You're gonna run that wagon
into the river, Calamity.
Better than listening
to you two old ladies arguing.
Who's arguing?
We didn't even draw our knives.
We didn't know it then, Janey,
but them was the last
of the Wild West times,
before everything changed
and Billy Cody made a show of it.
Them last few days of wildness
was our glory days.
Wild Bill Hickok,
Dora and Blue, Jim and Bartle,
Buffalo Bill Cody
and your mother, Calamity Jane.
I always enjoy seeing a lady
in her underwear.
What you packing up for?
We just made camp.
All these years,
I never presumed to give you advice.
But you gotta take Bartle and Jim
and get outta here.
- Why?
- Maybe just cos you know me.
I'm telling you, good time to go.
Thanks, Bill.
- Where are you heading?
- Deadwood.
Howdy, General.
Looks like
we're heading for the Bighorn.
You hoping to find more gold?
- You're dismissed, Captain.
- Yes, sir.
Who told you that, mister?
We're gonna clear out any Indians
that disobey the relocation notice.
Where did you post this notice
and what language was it in?
I don't need your advice, mister.
I have my own scouts.
Yeah, but they ain't Sioux.
This is hunting season.
There's thousands of Sioux.
Do not tell me how to fight Indians.
I took down Black Kettle.
Yeah, we heard about it.
But we're talking
about Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse.
They won't leave the hunting grounds.
You only got 200, 300 men here.
We are the Seventh Cavalry.
- Did you hear that?
- Yep.
Let's get the hell outta here.
I don't remember
who first called me Calamity or why,
but it's no mystery why it stuck.
Your mother don't always think first
before jumping in, Janey.
When Custer found out
I was a woman,
he forced me into doing
damn humiliating woman's work.
Calam!
We're moving out.
I'll catch up with you boys,
soon as I can.
Calamity?
Don't take too long.
That general is crazy.
- He's crazy!
- Let's go.
Jim and Bartle
were among the few left
who remembered
when beaver were plentiful.
They knew every river from
the Oregon Trail to the Rio Grande.
They could never figure out
that what they were searching for,
they'd already used up.
The Indians were dwindling,
the buffalo were gone,
and with them went the life we knew.
This pond
used to be boiling with beaver.
I can still hear it,
sometimes, when I'm asleep.
What?
That sound.
That slapping sound
a beaver's tail makes on the water.
Yeah.
Sometimes I can hear it, too.
There's a time
in the life of every gold town
when it either gets civilised
or goes bust.
Before it makes up its mind which,
men go crazy,
drinking, gambling and whoring.
Cutting into each other's claims
and shooting each other over trifles.
Deadwood just happened to be
in its hellfire days.
Ain't this a sight for sore eyes?
Morning, Harry.
- First one still on the house?
- Only for you, Calam.
I hear you got kicked out the army.
News sure travels fast,
but don't that beat all?
You'd think the damn fools
never saw teats before.
Alright, you debauched sinners,
let's drink to my bosoms.
They got me
out of Custer's Irregulars.
Bless 'em all, large and small.
- Hi, Bill.
- Calam.
Dora!
This woman's spoke for...
You son of a bitch!
Hell. Now she's gonna start
busting out crying.
Jane!
Where have you been?
Hell.
- I've been worried about you.
- I'm gonna find me another bed.
With quieter women in it.
Blue.
You alright?
Will you tell Doosie to make some ham
and some eggs and some biscuits?
Just tell her it's Martha Jane.
Yeah, sure, sweetheart.
Well, you two women, you just...
Get going.
Get out of my bed. You stink!
So are you settling down finally
in Deadwood?
No. It's getting mean here.
You know how it is.
Where you figuring on moving to next?
Someplace closer to Blue's ranch,
I guess.
Why don't you just marry him?
He's asked you a hundred times.
You know I can't do that.
Mercy, Martha Jane! You lose
a hugging contest with a skunk?
You know damn well that ain't skunk,
Doosie.
- It's grizz.
- Yeah. I'll burn these for you.
- There's money in them pockets.
- I'll find it, don't you worry.
Alright, tell me.
What's different about you?
Nothing.
Something's different about you.
You know you can't lie to me.
I ain't lying to you, Dora, am I?
Oh, my God, Martha Jane!
I've known you for 20 years
and this has never happened to you.
- Nothing's happened to me.
- You are in love.
Oh, God.
What's the point?
I'd rather die than have him know it.
- It's Hickok, isn't it?
- No! Don't say that name!
James Butler Hickok. Wild Bill.
- Let me think.
- No, Dora, don't start thinking.
It's a long way from hopeless.
He don't like prissies and he
don't even like whores that much,
but we're gonna get him to like you.
I don't want him to like me.
I just wanna die!
It's a serious condition, darling,
but it ain't fatal.
Here. Get out of that tub.
We've got work to do.
There.
Open your eyes.
Sweet Jesus!
Here, stand up.
You see? Aren't you beautiful?
I don't look anything like myself.
Yes, you do.
You look exactly like yourself.
Think he's gonna like me?
Every man in that place is gonna
want you so bad, it's gonna hurt.
I guaran-damn-tee it.
Now, walk like this, alright?
Yeah, like that.
That son of a bitch ain't even here.
- Two whiskeys with water, Harry.
- Water?
You want to stay in charge,
you drink half of what they drink.
I'll get it, ladies.
You've been holding out on the world,
Martha Jane.
Hello, boys!
Everybody! Boys!
Listen up. This here's Martha.
Now, dancing only,
and we'll be watching you.
Damn!
Keep back there.
If these halfwits can do it,
you sure as hell can.
Come on, Jesse. Your turn.
That's more like it.
See? You can dance.
That ain't dancing.
That's grizzly wrestling.
Oh, my God!
There he is.
Go on over there
and see how the game's going.
I can't.
Want to do
another round of grizzlies?
- No.
- No. Come on.
Come on.
Come here, darling. Have a seat.
Come meet a lucky charm.
You sure are charming.
Do you know who I am?
Sweetheart, I'm James Butler Hickok.
I've scouted for the best.
My senses are as keen
as any white man's you've ever known.
Have we met before?
You ain't fooling me, darling.
Of course we have.
What's my name?
Lily.
At least it ought to be Lily.
It'd suit you a whole lot better
in this get-up
than a name like Calamity Jane.
Lily.
Or Rose.
Please don't let on who I am.
Darling, I'm the soul of discretion.
Bill, you're the soul
of a black-hearted liar.
Boys.
Guess who I got sitting on my knee.
It's Calamity Jane.
- Blue.
- She'll be alright.
No, she won't.
Not out there, not dressed like that.
This is Calamity.
She can take care of herself.
She'll be back.
No, she won't. Not to Deadwood.
Don't cry, darling.
Don't cry.
It's OK, Lily.
It's Jane.
Yeah, of course it is.
That'd be real sweet.
Darling Martha Jane.
I cannot sleep with you worrying.
I can't help worrying, Blue.
It's all my fault.
I never should have gotten her
all gussied up.
Bill Hickok is a son of a bitch.
He sure is.
There have been times in my life
I might not have made it
if it wasn't for Jane.
Yeah, you done the same for her.
I've seen it myself. Lots of times.
I know. It makes me sad that
no man has ever loved her, you know?
Something they could never say
about you.
When you gonna marry me, Dora?
I gotta get back to my ranch.
Come with me.
I can't.
I love you, Blue.
You know how much I love you.
But I can't marry you.
You better quit saying that,
cos one day I might quit asking.
I am thinking
about moving closer, though.
You know?
Maybe opening a hotel in Miles City.
You are a stubborn old catfish.
But I'm gonna reel you in
a few miles at a time...
...till eventually
I land you as my wife.
No Ears.
You got any dry wood?
I would have brought some
but I didn't know anybody was here.
Where you been?
I ain't seen you in over a month.
I wanted to see if any of my people
were left in the Dakotas.
- Any luck finding them?
- A few are there.
But only their spirits.
You should not go this way.
I came to tell you this.
I'm headed for the Yellowstone.
I always go this way.
Go another way.
Why?
Smell of death. Maybe 50 miles.
Well, I ain't going 50 miles out
of my way. I ain't spooked by death.
I nursed the miners in Deadwood
through scarlet fever.
There ain't nothing worse than that.
Your dog's sure lived long
for one who likes to chase bears.
So have you and so have I.
Want some coffee, No Ears?
When No Ears was ten, his people
got into a fight with French traders.
He woke to discover
his people were dead
and his ears were cut off.
He could still hear
in a whistling kind of way.
He could always sense things
no one else could.
Especially death.
It was Custer.
I saw the flag.
- We should tell somebody.
- Why?
Was that massacre back there...
Was that like the one where they cut
off your ears and left you for dead?
I was just a child.
But all massacres are alike.
The smell of death.
The big birds
to pick the bones clean.
But then,
there were only Indian dead.
And only me to sing for them.
I must have eaten something bad
this morning.
I usually got a stronger stomach
than that.
It is because of the child.
Child?
I didn't see no child.
The one you're carrying.
You're crazy.
That's impossible.
I might be crazy,
but you know it is possible.
But that can't be.
I mean, I can't.
I can't have a child.
You will, in the spring.
God Almighty!
I can't be nobody's mother.
I got no place to live.
What am I gonna do?
If you need a place to go before
the child comes, I know of one.
How will I live?
You will live.
You always seem
to be looking out for me, No Ears.
Why is that?
These fish are ready.
Come and have some.
Where is this place...
where I can hole up?
The Wind River,
about four days' ride.
Thanks, No Ears.
- Mind that china, now.
- Here, Doosie.
- Well, Madame Dora.
- I'm not French, Hickok.
- You're not?
- No.
Next thing you'll be telling me
you're not a madam neither.
Men like you are the reason
that I'm leaving this town.
I'm sorry to hear that.
It'll be our loss.
I never really thought of myself
as a woman, Janey.
I guess that's why I didn't feel
like myself when I was carrying you.
I was with Dora when she had
her babies. None of them lived.
Though a part of me never really let
myself believe that you'd be real.
Without her babies
to hold her in place,
Dora had a restlessness inside her
that kept her moving from one hotel
to the next, one town to another.
She could never find any peace
except when she was with Blue.
But I stayed put all those months,
holed up,
waiting for you to come.
I never knew what it was
to be loved by a man, Janey.
That's just a plain fact.
I ain't saying it for pity.
But because of your daddy,
I know what it is to love one.
I want you to know that you were born
out of as good a love
as anybody gets born from, honey.
Don't you ever forget that.
The smell of death is strong.
Even you must smell it.
Gunpowder, kerosene and piss.
That's all I smell.
- There, see?
- Whoever he is, he's no grief to me.
- Who was that they hanged?
- Jack McCall.
- What did they hang him for?
- Killing Wild Bill Hickok.
Well done!
He killed my friend!
- He killed my friend!
- Don't shoot me.
Where's Dora?
I'll be with you in just a moment.
Where's Dora DuFran?
She's gone.
She sold out and moved away
six months ago.
Excuse me.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying.
I'm not selling anything.
I'd just like to talk to you.
Please. Just for a moment.
Is this your child?
- What of it?
- May I ask where the father is?
Murdered.
If I'd got here sooner, I'd have
cut the liver out of Jack McCall
and hung it on a tree, Indian-style.
Did your husband
leave you sufficient means?
No, he did not,
and he weren't my husband.
I can see
you're in a terrible predicament.
My name is O'Neill.
Captain James O'Neill.
My wife and I
lost a child a short time ago.
A baby girl.
That's why we came out here.
I thought a journey out West might
distract my wife from her grief.
- Where are you from?
- I'm from England originally.
But we live in Illinois now,
near Mary's family.
Illinois.
It's been a terribly difficult time
for my wife.
Well, it's been a terribly difficult
time for both of us.
We can't have any more children.
It might kill her.
Her name's Janey.
She's beautiful.
It's time to go.
We'll take good care of her.
You have a daughter.
A beautiful baby girl.
I loved you, you son of a bitch.
Dear Janey,
It's been more than five years now
since your daddy was killed.
I miss him and I miss you.
I know now
that the way I felt about Wild Bill
only happens to a person
once in their life.
Like Dora and Blue.
It's the same kind of love.
They just don't know
what to do with it.
Thou would still be adored
As this moment thou art
Let thy loveliness fade as it will
And around the dear ruin
Each wish of my heart
Would entwine itself verdantly still
It's so good to see you again.
I...
I came to tell you
that the house is finished.
It's beautiful.
I want you to come out and see it.
We can leave
first thing in the morning.
I can't.
Why not?
I don't understand you, Dora.
Why won't you come and look at it?
Because I'd probably love it
and that would make it even harder.
Tell me why you won't marry me
and I'll quit asking.
If you love me like you say you do...
- I do.
- Then why?
You like a town? A ranch ain't
lively enough for you? Is that it?
No.
I didn't build that ranch out there
out of nothing
just to live out there by myself
with no wife and...
...and no children.
I apologise, Dora.
I love you. I always will.
I'm asking you for the last time,
Dora.
Will you marry me?
I can't.
I love you more than anything.
But I can't marry you.
Cody, looks like we're gonna
get us a hot supper tonight.
- Blue.
- Martha Jane.
How you doing?
What are you doing here?
I was passing through and I thought
I might grab a bed for the night.
I didn't know
you was having a shindig.
- Well...
- Who's getting married?
- Come and dance.
- I don't dance.
Sure you do. Come on.
Ain't the bride
Granville Stuart's daughter?
I thought she was still a kid.
No, she's 18... 19.
Which one of your cowboys
is marrying her?
The one you're dancing with.
- The hell you say!
- Well, it's true.
You son of a bitch!
Simmer down, Martha Jane.
Simmer down?
You jilted the best friend I ever
had. Does Dora know about this?
Couldn't you tell her? Before
she finds out from somebody else.
You tell her yourself on your way
straight to hell, Teddy Blue!
I ain't doing your dirty work
or dancing at your goddamn wedding.
Martha Jane!
Martha Jane, you quit that!
Get up!
Now, sit down!
OK. Everybody, back inside.
It's over.
Plenty to eat and drink
and music and everything.
Just go on in, enjoy yourselves.
It's all over.
I never thought you'd turn out
to be a son of a bitch, Blue.
I'll tell you something.
See this porch?
I built this porch with my hands.
For Dora.
And a bathroom big enough to hold
that copper tub she loves so much.
And a kitchen where Doosie would
think she'd died and gone to heaven.
But Dora never even came
to look at it.
And every time I look at it,
I know she's never gonna be here
to welcome me home.
I guess I just got tired of hoping,
that's all.
Well, what am I gonna tell her?
You just tell her that...
nothing's changed.
I will. But it ain't true.
If you were in love with him
and he married somebody else,
would I go to his wedding?
I didn't plan it that way.
It just kinda happened.
Well, no true friend of mine
would have gone.
Why didn't you speak up
when the preacher said,
"Does anybody see a reason
why these two shouldn't be married?"
I sort of missed that part.
I can't believe he did this!
You could have been the bride.
He asked you plenty of times.
Now you're taking his side!
I am not taking his side.
God Almighty, Dora!
Blue let you down. I didn't. If you
can't see that, the hell with you!
Where's my hat?
Howdy, folks.
Come along to the show, kids.
How do you do?
Come along to the show, folks.
It's Calamity Jane.
That's the woman
I've come here to see.
I ain't in the mood for
your fancy jaw-flapping, Billy Cody.
Martha Jane,
I've travelled 1,000 miles
and gone to considerable expense
to find you,
to make you a star in my show.
Billy, I got a real itch
to shoot somebody this morning.
As an old friend,
I advise you to stay out of my way.
Think about it. We'll play
for the crowned heads of England.
I'm gonna put your name
on the poster, and your face.
Yeah, I can see it now.
Calamity Jane, half man, half woman.
Right between the dog boy
and the two-headed rattlesnake.
- No goddamn thank you.
- You can insult me if you want to.
I'm trying
but it don't seem to be taking.
Damn fool sideshow.
- Dora.
- Billy.
Look at you!
- These are for you.
- Fiddlesticks!
Dora ain't no child.
She can't be bought with this stuff.
Doosie, if you appreciated presents,
you might get some.
You made an impression
on Doc Ramses.
Doc Ramses? He ain't big enough
for me, Bill Cody.
And neither are you.
Billy! It's beautiful.
How did you know
I would be my same size?
Dora, if you lost your figure,
half the men in the West
would give up and get married.
Look at you. You already did give up
and get married.
How is Lulu anyway?
That was a mistake.
I should have married you, Dora.
What brings you to Montana?
I'm recruiting talent
for my Wild West show.
We're playing
Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.
Don't that take the cake!
Sure. I got Annie Oakley,
cowboys, Indians.
Hell, I got Sitting Bull himself
signed up.
Have you gone crazy?
The Indian wars are over in Missouri
but not here.
I can deal with Sitting Bull.
I want you to come to Europe
with me. You'll love it.
I... Do you want cream or lemon
with your tea?
The hell with tea!
Open your presents, Dora.
I got French champagne in here.
Billy, it's beautiful!
Dora, in my life,
I've met hundreds of women.
A lot of them rich and beautiful.
But every night when I blow out
my light, yours is the face I see.
We both know that I got rich
telling whoppers.
But them's the truest words
I've ever said in this life.
Are you gonna open that champagne?
Dora!
I dare say
we're not too hard to track any more.
Probably left a trail of tobacco spit
any citified dude could follow.
This was once a lively town.
Ten years ago,
there were two saloons up there.
You know,
we could have our own town.
No Ears could be the mayor.
I'll be the judge.
You can be the sheriff and
arrest anybody that comes to town.
Perfect.
We could charge big fines
for trespassing
or for spitting on the street.
It could beat beavering
as a way to get rich.
What's gonna draw people?
Your good looks
or my sunny disposition?
Darling Janey,
This bitter cold is something.
I had to put the ink
in the coffee pot to thaw it.
It was froze solid.
But I have to write these letters
so you'll know a little bit about me,
for I could someday
get ate by a bear,
get my head stove in
by some tough.
Someone who runs loose like I do
can get killed pretty quick.
A sweet little girl like you
shouldn't read this stuff.
But someday, when you're grown,
I hope you can read these letters
and know something of your mother.
Martha Jane.
Damn it to hell!
- What?
- What are we doing?
Sleeping. What's got you so itchy?
Looking at your sourpusses,
that's what.
You look like you belong
in a hospital, both of you.
One that keeps an undertaker handy.
You ain't one to be criticising
other people's appearances, Calam.
I know. I look no better myself.
Probably worse.
We got no business spending our lives
wandering round sleeping in the snow.
Nice catch, No Ears.
We ain't kids no more.
There ain't no more beaver.
There ain't no dry firewood.
There's just three fools
and an Indian.
The Indian's only in it
for the company.
Except for Jim, none of us
can hit a squirrel in broad daylight
unless he stands ten feet
in front of us and says "cheese".
You don't usually complain.
Nobody's gonna appreciate it
if you throw a fit.
My point is that Billy Cody's right.
The big adventure's over
and that's that.
He's right to make a show of it
and sell it.
I should have thought
of a Wild West show.
I got to the West
a long time before Billy.
You ain't planning on
joining Billy's spectacle, are you?
No, I ain't.
Not for a million dollars.
Where are you going?
You ain't had breakfast yet.
I'm going nowhere.
I got nowhere left to go.
But if you're smart, you'll stop
sleeping in the damn snow.
One morning,
you'll wake up frozen to death.
There's a white wind coming.
You stay. I will go after her.
A white wind
is a particular kind of blizzard.
One that confuses everything.
Even the best scouts refuse to move
in a white wind.
And I should have known better.
Skeedle! Get two blankets
and some whiskey.
Martha Jane,
I'm sorry for the things I said.
I didn't mean them.
You're my best friend.
It's OK. You're safe. You're home.
You're gonna be alright.
Bless your heart!
Tee, come put Satan in the barn.
If things don't improve, I'm gonna
have to entertain customers myself.
The more we make,
the more we spend.
We never get out of the hole.
We might
if we quit relocating all the time.
How's this?
- How are you feeling?
- Better.
Oh, God.
What were you fools doing
out in the blizzard?
We was looking for you, that's what.
That's very nice of you,
but don't be so stupid next time.
I'll see about
getting you guys a couple of beds.
Don't be getting any ideas
about the girls. This is business.
Yes, ma'am. I mean, no, ma'am. Dora.
Thanks, Doos.
I thought I saw you beaver boys
sneaking in the back door.
- Jane. Doosie.
- How you doing, Billy?
I brought you something
to get the chill off.
Thank you, Billy.
- This here is Doc Ramses.
- Gentlemen.
- Helping me get my show together.
- Much obliged, Bill.
So what are you boys doing?
Trapping beavers or what?
Mostly "or what".
The beavers are all gone.
Old Jim, he's reluctant to admit it.
I know how you feel, Jim Ragg.
I feel the same way
about the buffalo.
But there's no sense
grieving interminably.
I got a better proposition.
I want you to join
my illustrious company.
- I'm gonna make you heroes.
- We ain't no heroes.
We ain't even in the army any more.
You got to think
of the younger generation, Bartle.
The plains is filling up with towns.
Soon, the only way to see riding and
shooting will be in a Wild West show.
Yeah. You are partly to blame, Billy.
You were the one
who made a name killing buffalo.
Next thing we knew,
they was all gone.
And the Indians
was too starved to fight.
Now, if we had just
kept those buffalo,
I believe this whole business
would have lasted my lifetime.
Bartle, that is something
I regret myself.
I'm buying buffalo,
trying to bring 'em back.
I got over 100 head
grazing on my ranch.
- You're buying buffalo?
- Every one I see, Jim.
The way I see you boys
is as Lewis and Clark.
It was their expedition
that started the West.
- You'd be my stars.
- Yeah.
I'm sorry, Billy, but me and Jim
would rather spit on the flag
than make a mockery out of ourselves.
- Is there money in it?
- Money?
Lt'd make you prosperous, Jim.
I would go further.
I'd say it's gonna make you rich.
Well, I am happy to say
that we cannot be bought
for 30 pieces of silver.
I can. I'm gonna be in it.
Well, more than three people
in a room,
you clam up like a dummy.
There's gonna be
hundreds of people watching.
- Thousands.
- Thousands?
- Do I have to talk?
- No.
- Then I'm in.
- Good, Jim. Welcome aboard.
Now, Bartle, what about you?
- No.
- Bartle!
Lewis and Clark
ain't no heroes of mine.
Any jackass could walk to Oregon.
Don't be so stubborn.
Who do you wanna play? Geronimo?
You... bull!
Cody!
There you are, you old prodigal, you.
You planning to murder me
for my valuables?
You got that look in your eye.
I just can't figure out
what could have possessed you
to want to be part of the circus.
- I need the money.
- What do you need money for?
You can't stand to sleep
with a roof over your head.
I got an inspiration.
When Billy started talking
about buffalo,
I figured if you can buy buffalo,
why not beaver?
Buy beaver? Where on earth
you gonna buy beaver?
I don't know.
Somewheres.
I figured if we bought a few pairs
and let 'em loose
up in the high creeks,
they could procreate and proliferate
and be plentiful again.
Is that why you joined up with Billy?
Yep. I don't know why
you're so cantankerous about it.
You been wanting
to join up all along.
Old bull!
Are you gonna be Lewis
and I'll be Clark or what?
- I'll be Lewis. You be Clark.
- No, I'm gonna be Lewis.
Martha Jane.
- Get me a beer.
- The hell with that.
Drink whiskey with me.
You know I'm a reformed man,
Martha Jane.
Don't tell me your child bride
made you change your foolish ways.
I'm too old to start drinking whiskey
at ten in the morning.
Yeah, well, I'm too old to stop.
Dora, she...
She ain't hurrying down this morning.
Listen, Blue.
She threw a mad-dog tantrum at me
just for going to your wedding.
Figure out how mad she is at you.
I wish she wouldn't take it so hard.
Well, if it's not T Blue.
- What a surprise.
- Billy.
Whiskey, Tee.
You look prosperous.
Circus life
must be agreeing with you.
What did Bartle and Jim say?
Jim's in.
Well, if you ain't got Bartle,
you ain't got Jim.
What about you, Calamity?
You reconsider my offer?
You're an original.
Well, Billy,
my reputation's all I got.
And it ain't for sale.
How about you, Blue?
I reckon you're still
the best rider and roper around.
Even if you're looking
a little over the hill.
Sure, Billy.
Next time there's a blizzard in hell.
Doosie!
You're looking...
You're looking good.
You're looking better than a skunk
like you has any business looking.
You got a message for me?
I got a message alright.
Yeah?
She's expecting Mr Cody
in her sitting room.
If you both will excuse me. Calamity.
Blue, nice to see you.
I'm coming, Dora.
Tee, give me a whiskey.
And give one to Martha Jane.
Now, Blue, don't get all crazy.
I'm 40 years old, Martha Jane.
More, probably.
And, unfortunately, I don't shoot
people for that stuff any more.
You hurt her real bad.
You know she don't care about Billy.
But it's better than crying over you.
You've been my friend a long time,
Blue.
If you feel lower than scum
at the bottom of a pond,
you got it coming.
Tee, give me a bottle.
Hell, Blue.
You still don't understand
why Dora wouldn't marry you.
No, and I don't suppose I ever will.
When Dora was small,
she grew up in a farm in Kansas.
They could barely scratch a living.
When the war came,
soldiers stole the livestock.
When the sickness came,
they fell to it.
Dora's sisters died. And her mother.
- The boys just run off.
- I never knew that.
Finally, it was just Dora
and her father.
She was 11 when he died.
She walked to Abilene. All the way,
barefoot, thin as a twig.
She never forgot the feeling of being
hungry and watching everybody die.
She's scared to death
to live out on a farm, Blue.
Afraid you'd go off
and something might happen to you.
Afraid she'd starve.
I wouldn't have let her starve.
I'd have built a barn full of beef
to make her happy.
I know that, Blue.
But you can't talk
to fear like Dora's.
Why didn't she tell me?
She was afraid if you knew,
you might have moved to town
to marry her.
And that
would have killed your spirit.
And seeing that
would have killed Dora.
Thanks. Thanks for telling me that,
Martha Jane.
Take care, Blue.
- Goodnight, Billy.
- Dora.
Blue, what are you doing?
I'm scaling your castle walls,
darling.
You're gonna get yourself killed,
you fool.
It will be an honour to die for you,
Dora.
Blue.
Stand back, darling. I'm coming in.
Blue!
Blue, tell me you're not dead.
Dora?
Martha...
Martha Jane told me...
Told you what?
Why you wouldn't marry me.
Why didn't you tell me?
I never would have married anybody.
I'd have learned to live in town.
No, you've got to live
out on your ranch
on the land, under the sky.
That's who you are, Blue.
But I would have done it for you,
Dora.
But it's too late.
I know.
What are we going to do, Dora?
The best that we can.
We'll just do the best that we can.
Can you believe Bartle's going,
No Ears?
Mr Cody has invited me to join him
on this great journey as well.
You ain't going, are you?
I would like to see this water
they speak of.
They say it's so vast
you can't see the far bank.
What's the use of all that water?
You can't drink it
or water crops with it.
A prairie of water you can't drink?
No. Salt.
Do fish live in it?
Yep. Some of them
are as big as a house.
These fish are as big as the boat?
Yeah. Some bigger.
Maybe we should
ride around this water.
You can't. The ocean goes
to the top of the world.
I would like to know more
about this ocean.
It's because people fail to gather
precise information
about life-threatening matters
that many of them
are no longer alive.
So you're set on going, then?
I must see this water
and these great fish
and bring the knowledge
back to my people.
Don't forget to get me something.
- I reckon we're about to leave.
- Yeah?
- That's a fine slicker, No Ears.
- Check up on that paint pony.
Miss Dora.
Will you tell me all about the Queen
when you come back?
I sure wish you were coming with us,
Dora. I deeply wish it.
You show 'em.
Show 'em how wild the West really is.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Bye, Dora.
You should have come, Calamity.
- I was gonna make you famous.
- I am famous.
I can't stomach all this silly
hanky waving. Get outta here.
- Bye, Calam.
- So long, y'all.
They hadn't been gone a week
when I got the letter that
the woman I gave you to had died.
My heart ached for you, sweetheart.
I wanted so bad
for you to know you had a mother.
A mother who loves you.
The captain said
he'd taken you home to England.
Don't that beat all? England.
Right where my partners
were headed without me.
Why didn't you tell me?
I could have helped you.
Damn it to hell, Dora.
This letter's been to hell and back.
It's almost a year old.
I should have gone with Billy.
Maybe you can catch up to them.
You have to try.
She needs a mother
and she's got one.
A broken-down old bullwhacker's
better than no mother at all.
You'll be a wonderful mother.
You can bring her back here
and we can all live together.
I thought it was best for her, Dora.
There ain't a day gone by
I ain't regretted it.
You did the best thing you could.
- Dora?
- Yeah.
Do you think I'm doing
the right thing, going after her?
Honey, if I could see
one of my babies again,
even if I had to go
halfway round the world,
nothing could stop me.
I don't even know where she is.
I guess I gotta find her.
If I could just see her one time,
Dora...
...l'd die happy.
You'll find her. I know you will.
You gonna miss me?
I miss you already.
Do you remember the first night
that we saw Blue in Abilene?
Sure I remember.
And he was covered with dust.
And he walked up to me and said,
"Ma'am, would you dance with me?"
The dust from his clothes
kept making me sneeze.
And he just laughed.
And the more that I sneezed,
the more we laughed.
That was when I knew
that we were both done for.
Later that night, he rode his horse
right up the stairs to my room,
kicked the banister right off.
What are you gonna do
with a fella like that?
Ma'am.
Will you dance with me?
Come on.
I danced with a girl
with a hole in her stocking
And her heels kept a-knocking
and her knees kept a-rocking
I danced with a girl
with a hole in her stocking
And we danced
by the light of the moon
Buffalo girls,
won't you come out tonight
Come out tonight, come out tonight?
Buffalo girls,
won't you come out tonight
And dance by the light of the moon?
Dear Janey,
I'm coming halfway round the world
to find you.
I aim to bring you home
and give you all the things
I should have given you all along.
I ain't never been lucky,
but either
my luck has finally changed
or God's taken pity on a confirmed
old sinner like your mother.
I caught up to Billy's show
in New York
as they were pulling up the anchor.
An hour later,
and I'd have had to swim for it.
Billy!
Billy, damn it! Wait for me.
Martha Jane.
You almost missed your chance
of me making you famous.
I told you, Billy,
I already am famous.
You can make me immortal.
- I'm so glad to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.
Come on. Go!
Howdy, fellas. Howdy, boys.
Howdy.
Jim!
Calam!
What are you doing here? I thought
you wanted nothing to do with it.
To tell you the truth,
I couldn't live without you boys.
- I cried myself to sleep at night.
- Yeah, I'll buy that!
Think this rig'll get us
all the way to England?
- I'll be damned.
- What?
Sitting Bull. Billy's crazy.
Tell me,
why have you forsaken your people?
Perhaps you haven't realised,
Sitting Bull.
We are both on this boat together.
Then you will die alone in the water
and I'll feed you to the fish.
Howdy, chief.
How'd you like a little smoke?
Think about
trading in your life for his.
- Is it a good cigar?
- Yeah, it's real good.
He has become too popular.
It has confused him
about what is important.
Nah. He never knew
about what was important.
What the hell is that?
Pull!
Annie Oakley? Calamity Jane.
- How do you do?
- Howdy.
Pull!
Seeing as we're the only two females
in this here outfit,
how about I buy you a little drink?
Thank you, but I don't drink. Pull.
Well, how about if I join you?
See how I do against
the world's famous markswoman.
I only compete in the arena.
- Excuse me. I do need to practise.
- Me, too. I need to practise, too.
Pull.
Damn.
Pull.
I got that one! I hit that last one.
Pull.
Were you gonna leave
without saying goodbye to me?
Why do you have to go
to Belle Fourche?
- This is a good town for business.
- You mean it's convenient for you?
And just the right distance off
so you can come and visit me
and your new little wife
won't find out about me?
Don't you pull that on me.
A wife is one thing. Love is another.
I never would have married her
if I'd understood.
I never would have married her
if you'd told me the truth.
Dora, it's not too late
to change your mind.
It is too late.
It's over. I've sold this place.
- Dora...
- Don't start with me, Blue!
You don't deserve feeling sorry for.
I'm not going to Belle Fourche.
- Maybe it's better that way.
- Maybe it is.
If the whole point is to get
as far away from me as you can,
maybe you
should have gone to England.
You could have been
a regular Lillie Langtry.
- Maybe you should have gone.
- Yeah?
You're a better rider and roper
than any of those other cowboys.
Come here.
Don't leave me, Dora.
Please.
Can't it be
like it's always been between us?
I can't.
Every time,
it gets harder for me to let you go.
It's gotten to the point where
I fear your leaving
from the moment you arrive,
and it makes it awful hard
to find any joy in life.
Don't ever think that the loving
and the hurting ain't on both sides.
- I gotta go.
- No.
I gotta go.
Dora.
Darling Janey,
Your mother was not meant
for sea travelling.
The boat rolls day and night.
I had no notion
there was so much water in the world.
No Ears saw a whale today.
He thinks it is the most
extraordinary event in his long life.
He thinks it might be the first fish,
or maybe the first creature
of any kind.
He said it was so large, it might
even be as old as the world itself.
We ain't even got to England yet,
and he can hardly wait
to get home again
and tell his people about the whale.
I don't think
I ever saw him so happy.
This London is a great place.
It ain't the same sky
we have back home.
I ain't never been no great tracker,
but this place has me confounded,
I can't tell which way is which.
No sun or mountains
to take your bearings from.
Just buildings everywhere you look.
I can't figure out how people can
tell where the hell they're going,
let alone how I can find one house
and one little girl.
You boys go on exploring. I got me
some business to attend to.
What kind of business
you got in these parts?
You know I ain't exactly
the churchgoing type, Janey.
Generally, even my backsliding
goes unrepented.
But a little prayer keeps going
round and round in my head.
"Please let me find my little girl."
The sun has not gone down
a single day
that I ain't regretted
giving you away.
I know I ain't no blue-ribbon prize,
but I ain't a quitter neither.
By God, I'm gonna find you, honey,
or go belly up trying.
Cos whatever else I am,
I will always be your mother.
Martha Jane.
Miss Canary.
I knew you were in London.
I've seen the posters for your show.
But you didn't expect
to see me again.
Please, come in.
Please, come in.
May I offer you some tea?
No, thank you.
Something a little stronger, perhaps?
- No.
- Thank you, Daphne. No.
I'm sorry about your wife.
Thank you. Please sit down.
Janey's just a little girl.
It seems to me she needs a mother.
I may not be much,
but I am her mother.
I guess she's got a right to know it.
I can understand your feelings,
of course,
and in many respects you are right.
But you must also understand that
Janey knows nothing about you.
As far as she is concerned,
we are her natural parents.
- That's what you told her?
- Yes, it is.
We believed it would make her happy.
And she has been a very happy child.
I don't want to scare her or nothing,
but I want to take her home with me.
Miss Canary, when I first met you,
you didn't have a home.
Your life was hardly appropriate
to bringing up a child.
Can you tell me how
your circumstances have changed?
Well, my friend Dora,
that's Miss DuFran,
has offered us her house to share.
We'd be a good family to Janey. You
wouldn't have to worry about that.
She'd never go cold or hungry.
What kind of house is it, exactly?
It's just, you know, a house.
When can I meet her?
I'm not sure
that would be at all wise.
Mister, I'm gonna tell you,
one way or the other,
I'm coming back.
And I'm gonna see her.
How about a drink, pal?
- You want a pint?
- You sell whiskey by the pint?
One hell of a country.
You must be Annie Oakley.
What?
Annie Oakley,
the famous markswoman.
I ain't her.
- Pour me another one.
- Come on.
Who are you, then?
I am goddamn Calamity Jane.
I can outshoot and outride
that prissy little Miss Oakley
with one hand tied behind my back.
Look at this.
She-devil of the Yellowstone.
Scout for General Custer.
Bullwhacker.
Damn fine shot, too.
You English are all kinda skittish,
ain't you?
Alright, on your way.
- I'm putting this fella in ten.
- Right.
There's a tavern in the town
There's a...
Come back here.
Yeah.
Skittish.
Where the hell
are you dragging me to now?
Just wait. I got an idea.
Damn, this fog is solid.
I have never seen
such a place for fog.
One minute,
you can see where you're going.
The next minute,
you can't hardly see your feet.
- This way.
- Yeah.
Come on. That's it. That's it.
Well, I'll be blowed.
- Ain't they a sight?
- Yeah.
Howdy, Calam.
Well, I'll be jiggered.
No Ears said you'd found beaver.
But I didn't believe it.
Boys...
...I need money.
- How much you got?
- Not much.
I'm putting it away
for something important, Calam.
It's just a loan, Jim.
Did I ever not pay you back?
Yeah. Plenty of times.
Come on, Bartle, how much you got?
Well...
Here.
I need some back.
Tell her what for.
I have a weakness, Calamity.
One I don't know about, you mean?
If you're blind and deaf, you don't.
I got an overpowering fondness
for red-haired ladies.
Why, Bartle Bone, I'm taken aback.
Hope it makes you happy, Bartle.
It don't usually last long.
But there are moments, Martha Jane,
moments of true and outright joy.
Jim.
I gotta have it back, Calam.
I swear, Jim.
Thanks, fellas. You're true friends.
Think we'll ever
see that money again?
Gentlemen,
can we please try it again?
Annie is the only one in the show
still allowed
to use real bullets in her guns.
I've been watching her like a hawk
and have yet to see her miss once.
I need an advance on my wages
for the run of the show.
- All of it?
- Yeah.
And if I get thrown in jail too many
times, just let me rot in there.
Well, hell, I'll give you the money.
I don't want to hear more about this.
Not another nickel till next year.
Thanks, Billy. I'll drive the hell
out of that stage.
Listen. You get an idea
to shoot up another saloon,
you go ahead and I'll bail you out,
cos it's good publicity.
Thanks, Billy.
Howdy, gents.
I'm looking to make a small bet...
...on a shooting match tomorrow
between Annie Oakley
and this duke fella
y'all got shooting for your side.
Lord.
Lord Windhouvern.
There are those of us who'd put money
on the English marksman winning.
Good.
- How do the odds stand?
- Two to one.
Favouring the Englishman.
Let's make it
a little more interesting.
The contest
is best out of 1,000 shots.
What would the odds be if I bet Annie
Oakley beat this guy by ten shots?
I'd say you could easily get...
three to one.
Fine.
And if she beat this fella
by 40 shots?
Ridiculous.
- What would the odds be?
- You'd be throwing your money away.
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.
I'm looking for ten to one.
Annie beats this guy by 40 shots
and I put up £200.
Anybody take that bet?
Come over here and we'll find some
fella we can trust to hold on to it.
Alright, sir.
You're charged with trespassing.
Just the fella we can trust.
Hold on to this for us.
There's no need
to arrest this gentleman, officer.
But we would appreciate it
if you'd hold the fund...
...until a small wager is settled.
Glad to do it, Lord Windhouvern.
So you're him.
Well, this should be fun.
I want to know the name of the man
who would bet so heavily
on my defeat.
The name's Calamity Jane.
Have a good time
at the shooting match.
Miss Oakley?
Can I speak to you privately
for a minute, please?
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
- What is it?
- See you later.
I need your help.
But I can't very well ask you
without telling you why.
I know how to keep a confidence.
Sure.
A few years ago, I had a child.
That's why I came out here.
To find my little girl.
Now, I need enough money
to bring her back home.
I've scraped together
everything I could
and bet it all
on your shooting match tomorrow.
You gambled it all?
Everything you have?
Yeah. And then some.
- Am I supposed to win or lose?
- Win, of course.
I might be crazy but I'm not stupid.
You're the best anybody's ever seen.
I met this English lord.
He ain't much.
- How much do I have to win by?
- 40 shots.
Well, I'll do my best,
but even if I hit
every one out of a thousand,
that means he's still
gonna have to miss at least 40.
I ain't never been lucky,
but you have.
You're the luckiest person
I ever saw.
Jane, when I was five,
my father died,
leaving my mother
with seven children to raise.
I took his old rifle off the mantel
and learned how to use it.
If I missed a bird or a squirrel,
we didn't eat.
I learned not to miss.
It wasn't luck. It was necessity.
I sure got plenty of that.
Well, it seems to me,
in the long run,
that good and bad luck
kinda balance each other out.
I ain't got time for the long run.
I gotta do everything right
this time.
It's the only chance I'll ever have.
Careful. Careful!
Look out, ma'am!
Sorry.
- You sure are in a fix, miss.
- Yes.
Here, let me get that for you.
Thank you.
I...
- Where was you headed, ma'am?
- Actually, I'm just there.
- What's your name, mister?
- Ogden. Ogden Prideaux.
Nice to meet you, Mr Prideaux.
Did she break a leg?
Good Lord, no. I just lost a shoe.
- Here's your shoe, ma'am.
- Come on. Get back inside.
Now you've rescued me,
would you like some tea?
- Are you fond of tea?
- Tea?
Maybe you should
hitch your wagon first.
We haven't been formally introduced.
I'm Miss Dora DuFran.
I would be pleased if you would
join me for a cup of tea.
After you've hitched your wagon,
of course.
Ma'am, I intend to be right back.
He ain't coming back
in them muddy boots.
Don't get all worked up.
I ain't having five pounds of mud
on my floor this early.
We ain't open yet.
We ain't even unpacked.
You may not be open yet, but I am.
It won't kill anybody
if I have a gentleman for tea.
From the looks of him,
he can drink a bucket of tea.
Then you'd best go get a bucket.
- Ogden?
- Ma'am?
You seem awfully far away.
Would you mind
if I sat a little bit closer?
- Sit anyplace you like, Miss Dora.
- Thank you.
There. That's better.
Ogden, you take my breath away.
Am I too heavy?
No, ma'am,
you're as light as a feather.
Then why don't you pick me up
and carry me over to that bed?
Are you happy, Ogden?
Happy?
This has been the happiest day
of my whole life.
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could go on like this?
You mean me staying here?
Would you like to marry me, Ogden?
You mean like Ma and Pa?
Yeah, like Ma and Pa.
Well, will we do it today or when?
We could. Or tomorrow.
Well, let's do it today
so you don't change your mind.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
Pull.
Mark.
Pull.
Mark.
Pull.
Mark.
She missed one.
She's never missed one before.
For goodness' sake,
she hit the first 99.
She's only human.
This ain't a good time
for her to be only human.
How come?
How much you got on this?
- Everything.
- Everything?
The redhead money?
The beaver money? On the bet?
- Are you crazy?
- Goddamn calamitous is what I am.
Mark.
Billy.
Did he pick up a stone?
I think he's got a loose shoe.
I can take care of that.
You know where
Dora DuFran's establishment is?
That's it, right over yonder.
Hotel Royale.
- Who's that?
- His name's Ogden Prideaux.
Why's he painting Dora's?
Why? Cos he's married to her.
- That boy is married to Dora?
- Yep.
Talk of the town.
I'll be in the saloon.
Oh, my God.
- You seen him?
- Yes.
He must have found out
or else he'd be on his way here.
What if he shoots Ogden?
If he shoots him, he'd better
shoot him dead, cos Ogden's big.
What am I gonna do, Doosie?
- Tell me what to do.
- Alright.
Go downstairs and give Ogden a rifle
and tell him
he should go shoot an elk.
- Good.
- He could take the wagon.
And tell him he's not to come back
without that elk.
- Blue.
- Frank. Whiskey.
I ain't seen you
since the Deadwood days.
Don't you go disturbing the peace,
alright?
I mean, the jail here
ain't up to your standards.
I ain't disturbing the peace.
She must still like him.
There goes Ogden.
Maybe he'll use up
all his ammunition hunting.
Won't have any left to kill you with
when he finds you with his wife.
He ain't gonna find me
with his... wife.
Blue, I'm so sorry.
Don't be mad at me.
Come in.
Mark.
Pull.
Mark.
Pull.
I'm surprised you could tear yourself
away from the beaver pond.
- Yep.
- Yeah.
I figure the zoo's gonna send you
a couple of 'em.
- Maybe?
- Yeah.
- And if they don't?
- Maybe I'll stay here.
And not go back.
I ain't living my life here. No way.
Well, yours is yours and mine's mine.
I have lived 35 years with you
and, by God, you would rather have
the company of a beaver.
Pull.
We can't do this any more.
Dora, I keep telling you
that my marriage hasn't changed
the way I feel about you.
And that's the truth
as far as I'm concerned.
Did your marriage change everything?
No, not everything.
- Some things can't be changed.
- No.
Don't go.
Just... five more minutes.
What if he gets an elk right away?
He's not gonna find an elk
for five or ten miles.
What...
Whatever possessed you
to marry that boy?
I don't know.
He carried me out of the mud.
That is the sanest reason
for getting married I ever heard.
I wish I'd known that in Deadwood.
There's plenty of mud there.
We could have had
ten grandkids by now.
Don't talk like that.
You'll make me cry.
Hush, Dora, the sky ain't falling.
You got a fine strapping youth
to take care of you.
Better than a broken-down
old cowpoke like me.
And I love you the most.
I can't help it, Blue.
- I love you the most.
- I know you do.
Sometimes,
things just get away from me.
Yeah, I guess they do.
Who got married first?
Let's not argue about that.
We can argue about that till
bulls grow teats. It won't make...
It won't make any difference.
And what...
What about this boy?
Is he old enough to...
- Is he old enough to talk?
- Don't be mocking my husband.
He's a peach of a boy
and I'm fond of him.
Well, I'm gonna call him Ox.
You know
what the function of an ox is?
The function of an ox
is to take you out of the mud.
And as long as you restrict him
to mud duty,
you won't hear no complaint from me.
Blue, it turns out I needed somebody.
He's only a boy, but he's a good boy.
I was only joshing you, Dora.
I've joshed you
a thousand times before.
What's the matter?
I don't know. I'm not myself.
Mark.
Pull.
Mark.
Everybody's gonna
come see the show now.
Your Royal Highness,
ladies and gentlemen.
Miss Annie Oakley,
the greatest American markswoman
of all time,
has won the day.
- What's the score? I can't look?
- She's gonna win. Easy.
Yeah, but how much?
The final score,
Lord Windhouvern, 935,
and Miss Annie Oakley, 984.
I can't think. Is that more than 40,
Bartle? Help me.
I don't know.
Good bet, madam. Well done.
Here's beaver money, redhead money
and every dime I ever owed you
in my life with interest!
She did it!
You're a better shot than Cody,
if that's a consolation.
It's not, but thank you.
Yeah!
I only wish you was a drinking woman.
I never wanted
to buy somebody a drink so bad.
As a matter of fact,
I am feeling extremely thirsty.
Here's to Annie Oakley,
the greatest shot that ever lived.
No.
To all of us buffalo girls.
- We gotta stick together.
- Yeah.
- Got one, Doosie.
- Yeah. Come on in.
You did good.
Dora?
What's the matter?
Are you sick?
Dora?
I guess I know why you're crying.
Why?
Well, you don't want
to be married to me no more.
It's alright, though. I mean,
I was expecting this and all.
Ogden.
Good afternoon, Miss Canary.
Captain O'Neill.
I trust I find you well.
Yep. I'm really well, thank you.
Good.
Is Janey here? Can I see her?
No, I'm afraid
she's out at the moment.
Did you tell her about me?
No, I did not.
- I told you I was coming back.
- I know.
Miss Canary, I will do nothing that
could disturb or upset Jane's life.
You son of a snake.
I am only considering
Jane's best interests.
The hell you are!
She's my daughter.
She needs the sun and the sky
and the Rocky Mountains
and she needs me.
I could show her things
most people just dream about.
Could you?
- Yes, I could.
- Then come with me.
- You throwing me out, mister?
- No, I am not.
I want to show you something.
Come with me.
Come on, darling. Come on.
Daddy, did you see me?
Did you see me jump that tree?
I did, my darling,
and it was wonderful.
Janey, I'd like you
to meet Miss Canary.
How do you do?
A whole lot better
now that I get to meet you.
Miss Canary has come a long way.
All the way from America.
She's a kind of...
- Kind of a cousin.
- A cousin.
Have I ever met you before?
Yeah.
But you were just a little bitty
thing. Too young to remember me.
That was some pretty good riding.
Thank you. Do you ride?
I got me a big black stallion. He was
pretty wild in his younger days.
- I love horses, don't I, Daddy?
- Yes.
I hope to have my own one day.
- I know you will.
- Do you really think so?
Come on, Jane, it's getting late.
We'd better go back.
Are you coming to dinner with us?
Well, I wish I could.
But I know we'll meet again.
- Come on.
- Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Janey.
I'm getting better and better.
Are you listening to your instructor?
- Of course.
- What did you learn today?
I learned to go
from a trot to a canter.
You had to hand it to Billy.
He sure knew
how to put on one hell of a show.
He got so famous,
they put a statue of him
in Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum.
He dragged me to see it
and in the basement
I found the damnedest things.
Look. Here's some special glue.
How's that? Can you hear better?
I can hear many things.
The West began with Lewis and Clark,
two brave and fearless mountain men
who blazed the trail westward
all the way to the Pacific.
And next,
for your entertainment pleasure,
ladies and gentlemen,
the wildest woman of the West...
...Calamity Jane!
Give me back that ear.
You have no bullets.
Sorry, I forgot.
You mess with No Ears,
I'll eat your liver.
Calamity, you're on. Go!
Get on your horses!
Woman Who Walks Like A Man
can walk no more.
No, Sitting Bull,
it's just a show now.
Miss Canary.
Janey has been pleading with me to
allow her to come and see the show.
And so finally,
I had to give in and bring her.
I didn't know
that you were Calamity Jane.
Is it really the last night?
Can't we come again tomorrow?
What do you say you and me
go for a little ride together?
I'm not sure.
Just round the ring.
She'll be safe with me.
Can I, Daddy? Please?
Very well.
Come on.
In my lifetime
I've had a lot of misadventures,
but my great joys have been few.
The time I held you in my arms
the day you were born
and the time I held you sitting
up there in front of me in the saddle
like I imagined you
hundreds of times.
You're real to me now, Janey.
And for the first time,
I can finally let you go.
I'm here on behalf of the mayor
of Ten Sleep, Montana.
And the judge and sheriff, too,
for that matter.
We've been figuring
on starting a kind of zoo of our own
and supplying it with samples of
all the animals native to the area.
But we've been having trouble
with the beaver.
You see,
the beaver's been all trapped out.
We looked all over them parts,
but have been unable to find any.
So I was wondering
if you could see your way clear
to selling us a healthy pair.
One male and one female...
...so they... so they might...
...you know.
Would you sell us a pair of your own?
It's Calamity!
Hi, darling.
This here's Comanche.
He's the best horse in the show.
He might look
like a big handful right now,
but you take charge of him,
make him respect you.
For me? Really?
Yeah, he's for you.
I will. I promise.
- Excuse me. One moment.
- I'm so glad we have the same name.
I want to be just like you
when I grow up.
Well, maybe just... not just like me.
But there'll always be
a streak of me in you.
And a streak of your daddy, too.
Goodbye, little Janey.
I'll write to you.
Goodbye, Calamity.
What's the matter?
You've been moping
round here since Blue left.
I ain't feeling so good.
What's ailing you?
You wanted a husband,
you got you one.
I think I'm gonna have a child.
Well, I'll be... You sure is!
I'd have seen it if you weren't
so puffy from all that crying.
Get in bed and stay there.
You ain't gonna do a lick of work
till you have this baby.
I have too much to think about.
Think laying down.
You done miscarried twice.
I'm scared enough without that.
I'm trying to scare you enough
to get you back in that bed.
Maybe it'll be a little girl.
It wouldn't be so dull round here
if we had us a little girl.
I can't be sure, Doosie, but in
my heart, I think it's Blue's child.
Well, that don't matter much. Babies
got to take what they can find.
They can't be worried
about this pa, that pa.
Let 'em have two pas
if they could find two.
It ain't gonna hurt nothing.
Both the babies that I lost
were Blue's.
The girl didn't live but three hours.
The little boy lived two months.
I wouldn't have survived
if it wasn't for Blue.
Well, if you want a good,
strong, live baby,
please, get on up and go lay down.
I'll make you a bowl of soup.
Come on. You my baby now.
Stop!
Jim.
- We should make camp.
- But it ain't close to nightfall.
We should stop now, make camp.
He don't make sense,
but he ain't never wrong.
Jim?
Ain't you gonna hunt up some
measly-looking critter for supper?
Bartle?
What do you figure?
Five to ten years,
and the beaver'll take hold
and be plentiful again?
Well, maybe.
We seen some glory days...
...you and me.
Sure we did, Jim.
Some glory days.
Jim?
There is a god, Janey.
After all I seen,
I feel certain of it.
Maybe we each had a reason for
going to the other side of the world.
No Ears got to see the first fish.
Jim...
Well, there's always been something
of the preacher in Jim.
The sermon
just happened to be beaver.
Bartle got to see the world,
shake hands with the Queen,
and have a few moments
of outright redheaded joy.
As for your mother, honey,
if I'd had to go to the moon and back
for one look at your sweet face,
it would've been worth
all the trouble.
I'm not going with you, Martha Jane.
I'm walking north
to the Platte River.
That's hundreds of miles.
I need to find my people,
if there are any of us left,
and tell them
about the great whale fish.
I hope you find your people.
The weather's good.
It'll be a pretty walk.
I'm headed to Dora's
in Belle Fourche.
You should come for the winter
if you can make it.
You oughtn't to be wintering hard
at your age.
I'll be listening for your coming
with my new ears.
I'll be seeing you, No Ears.
Congratulations. Take
possession whenever you like.
Thank you.
Ogden, I just bought a hotel.
A beautiful, elegant hotel.
We're moving to Deadwood
in the Dakotas.
- You mean after the baby comes?
- No. After lunch.
Thank you.
Take the food out there
and put it in the first wagon.
Honey, leave the piano.
We'll buy a grand one
once we get the hotel prospering.
It's downright crazy
to be moving now.
No, it's not. If I wait till after
the baby's born, it'll be winter
and I can't wait till spring.
Look at that.
It's Martha Jane.
And Bartle.
Wonder where Jim is. Martha Jane!
Bartle?
Cody!
I'm so glad you're back.
We ain't all back. Jim's dead.
What did he die of?
Just one of them senseless things,
I guess.
What's this?
A lot happened
while you were away.
Yes.
Who's the sapsucker?
That's Ogden. He's my husband.
- How do?
- Howdy.
I guess for once I'm tongue-tied.
Come on. Let's have a drink.
Did you find her? Janey?
Look.
- She's beautiful.
- Ain't she beautiful?
She's even more precious
than the picture.
She looks just like you.
Jane, I've missed you so much.
Me, too, Dora.
So what you gonna do, Bartle?
I don't know.
Maybe I'll track down Billy Cody
and sign back on with his show.
I don't mind the show business.
It's a job. Pays well.
Never thought I'd hear you
wanting for work.
Maybe you just miss
them redheaded English whores.
Maybe I do.
I expect I'll see you sometime,
Bartle.
I always have.
I expect.
We seen some glory days, Bartle.
You and I.
The like of which
may never come again.
Yeah.
You and me.
And old Jim.
Bye, Calam.
Bye, Bartle.
Go on, you...
...you furry little sons of bitches.
They could procreate,
and proliferate...
Jim?
...and be plentiful again.
Jim!
Skeedle, tell 'em to unlock
the back door.
- Isn't it grand, Doosie?
- Yeah. It's fine.
But I'm telling you right now,
I ain't never moving no more.
Well, never say never.
Say never about something,
life'll spit it right back at you.
Look at me.
I said I'd never get married.
You married, but I ain't you,
and I ain't never moving no more.
Will you go lie down now?
Ogden? You got that bed put up?
Yeah, but it still needs bedding.
Get upstairs, if you can make it.
You look like you 'bout ready to
drop that baby where you standing.
It's coming.
The pains have started.
Landsakes!
Ogden, come on, pick her up!
Where's Blue?
Hush now.
Try to sleep.
Doosie.
I'm right here.
So's Ogden. And your baby.
Where's the baby?
Let me hold the baby.
She's a big, healthy girl.
She's gonna be just fine.
Doosie, promise you'll stay.
Course I'll stay.
I already told you
I wasn't moving anywhere.
I'll go get you some cool milk.
Gotta start getting
your strength back.
Where's Martha Jane?
She's outside pacing around.
Martha Jane?
You'd better come up now.
Come on down to the kitchen
and get some food in you.
You look about ready
to take sick yourself. Come on.
Martha Jane'll sit with her.
You take her, Jane.
- I'll hold her for you.
- No. You take her.
You raise her for me.
She's gonna need a good mother.
Say you will.
I will.
You'd better go tell Blue.
Tell him what?
Just tell him yes.
I love you, Dora.
I know you do.
- Martha Jane.
- Blue.
You turn up in the darnedest places.
Never thought I'd see you
stringing wire.
Well, if you're looking for a job,
you're hired.
I wish that's what I'd come for,
Blue.
Is everything alright with Dora?
She had a baby girl.
This time the baby lived.
The baby lived?
She's beautiful.
Just like her mom?
Her eyes are blue.
Dear Janey,
I'm sorry it's been so long
since I've written to you.
After Dora died, I lacked the spirit
to take up my pencil.
The baby is well and beautiful.
Bartle has gone into show business.
He plays in a melodrama,
a villain they call Black Bart.
He's married a redheaded actress
who bosses him something awful.
But he don't seem to mind.
I try to stay put most times.
But, sometimes, I have to take
to wandering God's foothills.
The glorious Rocky Mountains.
In my mind, I still hear
Bartle and Jim argumentary as ever.
Now and then, I'll come across
one lone buffalo or a beaver,
and it warms my heart.
But never a day goes by that I don't
miss my darling baby girl.
I'll always be your mother.
Calamity Jane.
