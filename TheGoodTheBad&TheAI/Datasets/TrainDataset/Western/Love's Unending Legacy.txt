-  Hey, Mr. Bartender!
-
I'll see you.
-  Come here, darlin'!!
- Read 'em.
-  Sheriff.
-  Evening, Sheriff.
- Pleasure doin' business with ya...
- Lyin' cheat!
Oh, my God!
Mama, it's getting late.
Come here by Mama.
Do you think...
Pa and Kathy are watching over us?
Yes, sweetheart, I do.
Is there anything you want
to say to them before we go?
I love you,
and I miss you every day.
Why don't you go on ahead?
I'll be there in a minute. Okay?
It seems wrong
to leave you here, Willie.
And I know that you and Kathy
will look after each other.
And no matter how far away I am...
you will always be in my heart.
I'll see you again.
Pa and I are going to Pennsylvania
to see my sister and her husband.
- Who are you going to visit?
- We're not visiting anyone.
We're going to live
with my grandpa and grandma.
You're leaving home?
My pa was the sheriff
of Tettsford Junction.
He got himself killed
a couple years back.
Gosh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh, look, Maddy.
Hyah!
Hyah!
-
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Maddy!
Hey, Pa!
- I missed you!
- Oh, I missed you so much!
- Come here, young man!
- Grandpa!
Grandma!
My, my, my, Maddy.
How you have grown.
And looking more like your father
with every year.
Do you really think so, Grandma?
I really do, sweetie.
I bet you're hot and thirsty.
- There's fresh-churned buttermilk inside.
- All right!
Welcome home, Missie.
It's good to be home, Mama.
I just wish...
I know. I know.
Let's see what you do now.
Your move.
- Yeah, right. King me!
-
- Somebody's been practicing.
- Yes, I have.
Your father found you a house in town.
It's small and it needs some work...
but it's near the school
and the rent is reasonable.
Good. On my teacher's pay
I can't afford much.
I really wish you'd reconsider
staying with us...
at least for a little while.
- Do you need the help, Mama?
- No.
I really appreciate you and Papa
wanting to help me and Maddy.
But I need to stand
on my own two feet right now.
Maddy needs to see that
even though his daddy's gone...
he still has one parent
strong enough to take care of him.
The other day...
Maddy asked me what color
his father's eyes were.
He couldn't remember.
Maddy might forget details like that...
but he won't forget the things his father did
with him or the things Willie taught him.
I'm starting to forget little things
about Willie too.
Like that last morning
when we said good-bye.
Did I kiss him? I think I did,
but I don't remember.
It's only been three years, Mama.
Just like with Maddy, you'll remember
the things that mattered...
like how much you and Willie
loved each other.
No one will ever love me that way again.
And I will never love anyone else.
I can't imagine being truly happy again.
That's how I felt
when my first husband died.
And then I met your father.
See, I feel if I were
to love someone else...
that I would be betraying Willie
in some way.
Willie would want you to be happy.
Whoa. Whoa.
It's gonna take a bit of work,
but I can help you out with that, Missie.
That's all right, Pa.
It's gonna be just fine.
Maddy. Look what I found.
It's our Christmas star.
I promise you, Maddy,
I will make this into a nice place.
It won't be like home though.
Do you know
what makes a house a home?
No.
Home is where
you'll always have a place...
where you will always feel loved...
and where you will never,
ever be alone.
It might not seem like it now,
Maddy, but...
this place will come to feel like home.
Come here.
O Lord, how manifold are your works.
We thank you for the sun and the rain...
which help nourish the crops...
and help them grow into sustenance
for our minds and bodies.
In wisdom you have made them all.
Amen.
-  Amen!
- I have an announcement.
I received this notice from
the Children's Aid Society of New York.
And it says,
"Wanted: Homes for children.
"A company of homeless children
from the East will arrive on Friday.
"These children are of various ages
and of both sexes...
"having been thrown
friendless upon the world.
We seek good homes with decent families
who will love them as their own. '
Distribution of these children
will take place right here at the church.
I know I can count on all of you to open
your hearts to these precious children of God.
God bless you all.
Pastor Joe! Hi!
- Well, I've heard a lot about you, Missie.
- Oh. All good, I trust.
Your father thinks the world of you.
Seems we're neighbors.
My husband and I are just
two farms away from your new house.
All right.
See you tomorrow morning!
- Pastor.
- Ah, Mrs. Pettis.
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Sheriff.
We missed you at Sunday services today.
Clara!
-  He should be comin'!
- That's his choice.
I know. I know.
- We'll see ya.
- Bye.
Sheriff Tyler couldn't be bothered
to attend church.
Again.
Well, he's pretty busy
keeping the peace.
We should be going, Mrs. Pettis.
Well, it looks like your husband had a reason
for not showing his face in church as well.
There is much work
to be done on the farm...
and we can't afford hired help.
If my husband doesn't do the work,
we don't eat come winter.
Good day, ma'am. I'm Sheriff Tyler.
Hello, Sheriff. I'm Mrs. LaHaye.
Yes, I know. Small town.
Word gets around.
- I heard about the new teacher.
- What else have you heard?
Your folks are Clark and Marty Davis,
and you have a little boy.
- Maddy.
- Maddy.
Pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Mrs. LaHaye.
Could I have some more, Grandma?
- Mmm. Maddy.
- It's all right, Missie. Sure you can.
You spoil him.
Of course I do.
It's my job as a grandma.
So tell me more about this orphan train
Pastor Joe was talking about.
Now, Marty, you know you're not
well enough to be chasing after a child.
- I will be soon.
- For now, we're gonna have to
let other people handle that.
Would you consider
taking in one of those children?
Yeah, Mom! Then I'd get
to have a brother or sister!
- No.
- But all my friends have
a bunch of brothers and sisters.
But since Kathy died,
I've had none.
I'm sorry, Mama.
That's all right, Maddy.
It's good to talk about her.
We don't want to forget her.
Right?
Right.
Don't stand so close.
But I'm scared, Lindy.
I told you... get away from me.
Folks don't want a brother and sister.
Whoa.
Oh, they're so cute.
Don't you think?
You mean the one on the right,
or on the left?
Good day, Mrs. LaHaye.
Oh. Sheriff.
- You gonna take one of these kids?
- No.
I was just passing by, and I thought
I would stop in and see how it was going.
Good day.
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming today.
These children are putting their faith
in the kindness of strangers like you.
Let's begin with Alice Moore.
- Alice, you wanna come up here next to me?
- Go on.
Alice is seven years old.
She was orphaned when her parents died
in an influenza epidemic.
Paul, she's the same age as Lily was
when we lost her.
Do you think that we could...
May we take Alice aside
and get acquainted with her, Pastor?
You certainly may.
Why don't you go with these nice folks?
Jonas Sykes is nine years old. His parents
were killed three years ago in a fire.
Oh, he's such a nice boy.
Ruth Lind is five years old.
She was left on the doorstep of
the Battery Park Orphanage as an infant.
- Well, I'm sure certain. Let's do it.
- Mm-hmm.
Hello!
Next is Belinda Marshall.
She's 14 years old.
- We need a boy.
- The boy's too young. And scrawny.
She's older. She looks like she
could handle herself on a farm.
I'll look her over, Pastor,
see if she might do.
Open your mouth.
- Why?
- I wanna make sure you're healthy.
Oh, you're spirited, huh?
That's all right.
That means you're tough.
You'll be a good worker.
We'll take her.
I'm not going with you! You smell!
You probably haven't had a bath for a year!
Watch your mouth, girl.
Ow! Geez!
- She's incorrigible.
- He looks healthy enough.
We'll take him. He looks like
he'll grow into a good farm hand.
- That isn't the point, Hank.
- I thought the point was to find homes
for these young 'uns.
Anyone else here want 'em?
If he comes with us, he gets
a decent home with plenty of good food.
And I'll see he comes to church.
The choice is yours, Jacob.
You don't have to go with them.
Would you rather
go back to the orphanage?
No.
All right then.
Sign the paper, Sheriff.
Come here, boy. Come on. Let's go.
Come on.
I'm sorry, child. Looks like you'll
have to get back on the train.
Unless someone can find room for her.
My house is small. There's barely
enough room for me and Maddy.
I'm Missie LaHaye.
I'm the schoolteacher here,
and I have a little boy.
I can't offer you much.
No fancy dolls
or store-bought dresses.
But if you come to live with me,
I'll treat you kindly.
Okay?
I'll take that as a yes.
Welcome to your new home.
Maddy? This is Belinda Marshall.
- She's going to be living with us.
- For how long?
Just till I'm old enough to leave.
Not a day longer.
Let's just say for the foreseeable future
and leave it at that for now.
You can put your things over here.
Um, I'll make up a bed over here...
and hang some curtains
around it for privacy.
- I'd rather sleep in the shed.
- Oh, no.
It's too dirty, and there's lots
of broken-down old furniture and stuff.
I don't care. I'll fix it up myself.
Maddy, will you go over
to Mrs. Hudson's...
and ask her if we can borrow
her spare mattress just for a while?
Belinda, I would like for you to stay
in the house with me and Maddy.
- Why?
- Because this is your home now.
Belinda, we're your family.
You're not my family.
I've got a papa back in New York.
He'll be coming for me
soon as he gets a job.
I won't be staying here long,
so don't think I will.
This should do for now.
At least until it turns cold.
Is that your family Bible?
Something your parents gave you?
No.
We each got one at the orphanage.
Have you read much of it?
Maybe we could read a passage
tonight after supper.
No.
- What grade are you in, Belinda?
- No grade.
I mean, in New York
what's the last grade that you finished?
- First.
- That's as far as you've gotten in school?
I had work to do.
There was no time for school.
Belinda, can you read?
What if I can't? Doesn't matter.
Don't need to know how to read to sweep
a floor or bake biscuits or wash clothes.
But books open up a whole world to you.
They teach you things like how much
an African elephant weighs...
or how Betsy Ross came
to make the first flag.
Why would I need to know
any of those things?
It's not just facts and history.
There are stories
that touch your heart...
and make your imagination soar.
Books can take you anywhere.
You could, uh, go to China
or be in the court of Queen Elizabeth.
I'm going outside.
Grandma! Grandpa!
- Hey!
- Hey, sweetheart.
Hey there.
Mama, Papa, this is Belinda.
Welcome to the family, Belinda.
We hope that you'll come to think of us
as your grandparents.
- I'm not your granddaughter.
- We're not trying to take the place
of your grandparents.
We just think a child can't have
too many people who love her.
Do you have grandparents
back in New York?
No. And I don't need none either.
Well, I think it's just about time
to sit down to supper.
- Belinda.
- What?
We say grace first, Belinda.
Do you know what that is?
Of course I do. We had to pray
over our food at the orphanage.
- I don't know why.
-  Well, it's important.
We're very fortunate.
A lot of people go hungry.
Bet I know that
a lot better than you do.
Let's bow our heads and pray.
Dear Lord, we thank you
for everything that you've given us...
especially for the new member
of our family...
Belinda.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Yeah!
Let's go!
We're gonna go play with the puppies
down in the barn. Do you wanna come?
No.
If you change your mind,
you're more than welcome to join us.
Getting big there, boy.
- Come here.
- I'll beat you to the barn!
For the life of me...
I don't know what possessed me
to take in that child.
I sure didn't need
any more responsibility.
Then why did you?
Well, I didn't intend to.
But when I rode past the church that day,
something stopped me.
Then when I heard Pastor Joe say,
"Will someone take this child? '
It was as if another voice
came out of me saying, "I will."
Maybe it was another's voice.
You think God was speaking through me?
I think God knew that Belinda needs you.
And maybe, for some reason that you
don't understand yet, you need her.
Look at her play! She's so cute!
- I think he makes a nice hat.
- Snowball!
- There you go.
-
Come here, boy!
Come over here! Get over here!
I told you.
You tryin'to get away?
Is that it?
You tryin'to get away?
Answer me, boy! Come here, boy!
Better get over here!
You think you can just run away
'cause you don't like your chores?
Huh? I can make you work
as hard as I want!
- Get in there! Take your punishment!
- Ow! Ow! Why?
That's rising nicely.
If I get the berries,
can I use your oven to bake some pies?
Pies? Of course.
Is that one of your favorites, berry pie?
Not mine.
My mother's.
Belinda's gonna bake us some fruit pie.
That's nice.
- What's the matter, Clark?
- I gotta take care of somethin'
for the Fletcher widow.
Go back inside, Belinda.
- What are you gonna do?
- What I have to.
- I'm coming with you.
- Fletcher widow's horse broke loose.
He fell in a gully and broke his leg.
She asked me to put him down for her.
- You're gonna shoot an innocent animal?
- Because it needs doing.
Now please, go back inside.
What if the horse's leg can be fixed?
Shouldn't you at least try?
Why is everybody so cruel?
Why doesn't God stop you?
- Please don't kill it! Please!
- Child, listen to me.
I'll check his leg.
If I can save his life, I will.
But if the bone is shattered, would you rather
I leave him to be eaten alive by coyotes?
Wait here, child.
Belinda, your food is getting cold.
What's the matter?
Can I?
Lindy?
I brought you some food.
- Maddy?
- Yes?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Do you think there's enough berries
for a pie?
Not hardly.
Don't you know nothing?
I know a bunch of things.
I just don't know how to make a pie.
We need a lot more berries.
So quit talking and start picking.
Which ones are the better,
the squishy ones or the hard ones?
-
- Maddy!
Help!
Maddy!
Maddy, are you okay?
Oh, my gosh.
No. My arm hurts real bad.
We have to get you into town.
Can you stand? Can you stand up?
- What happened?
- I fell.
I can see that.
Here.
Let's take you over to Mrs. LaHaye's.
What happened?
Maddy, are you okay?
Apparently, he fell.
I tore my clothes. I'm sorry, Mama.
It's all right, sweetheart.
- Will you take him inside?
- Sure. Come on, little fella.
Come along, Belinda.
I don't think it's too bad.
It bled a lot, but it's not broken.
- Thank you, Sheriff.
- I didn't do anything.
She managed to get him into town.
Thank you, Belinda.
I'll go get a towel
and a bowl of water.
Sweetheart, does it hurt?
Yeah.
What is it?
Nothing.
I'd best be going.
You're a very brave boy.
Missie told me about
how you took care of Maddy.
How did you know how
to get the bleeding to stop?
My mama taught me stuff.
She used to be a midwife,
so she knew all about fixing people.
At the orphanage there were
so I helped out.
Did you like doing that?
Yeah.
It made me feel good.
Have you ever thought about
becoming a nurse?
Me, a nurse? I don't think so.
Why not?
Someone like me
can't do something like that.
What do you mean, someone like you?
You know.
Poor.
Plain old poverty can't keep you from
doing something you really want to do.
Only poverty of spirit can do that.
My mama always wanted to be a nurse.
She never got the chance to.
Your mama was never able
to pursue her dream.
I think she'd be very proud if you were
able to do something she couldn't.
No matter how early we leave,
we are always running late.
Is that why we're always running?
What's the matter with you, boy?
We ain't got money
to go wasting on your clumsiness!
- Hello, Mr. Pettis.
- Mrs. LaHaye.
Jacob only tripped.
It was an accident.
Money's tight, Mrs. LaHaye. Couple more
"accidents" might well put me in the poorhouse.
And you might want to keep an eye
on your own young 'uns.
Let's go.
Ready? Set? Go!
- Run!
-
- Go, Sam!
- You have to win!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Can I play?
- Course not.
- Why not?
Nobody likes you.
That's why.
You're just a no-account orphan.
You take that back, liar!
All right. That's enough.
-
- Get up.
I said, that's enough.
Now, someone wanna tell me
what happened here?
How about you and I
go over here and talk?
It wasn't my fault!
I didn't start it!
I know that Stevens boy well enough to be
pretty sure he did or said something mean.
- You wanna tell me what that was?
-
Must have been pretty bad
if you don't wanna say.
He just...
He wouldn't let me play, is all.
It's hard being the outsider.
I imagine your whole life's pretty hard
right now. But you can't give up.
I can run faster than all of them.
I bet you can. Why don't you
go back there and show 'em? Go on.
-  Go!
-
I can outrun any of you.
No, you can't. You're a girl.
Yeah, and you're a stupid bully,
but I can still outrun you.
You wanna get beat bad?
Come on in.
Once around the old oak.
Ready? Set? Go!
- Come on!
-
Recess is over.
Everybody back inside.
- Next time I want you on my team. Okay?
- Good job.
Why do I get the feeling that something
just happened and you were a part of it?
Nothing I couldn't handle, ma'am.
If I were you,
I'd keep an eye on that Belinda.
If she does run,
you're not gonna catch her.
-  Hey, Mr. Bartender!
-
I'll see you.
-  Come here, darlin'!!
- Read 'em.
-  Sheriff.
-  Evening, Sheriff.
- Pleasure doin' business with ya...
- Lyin' cheat!
-
-
I brought food.
- It smells really good.
- You gotta hide it from 'em.
I'll put it under my bed.
I'll try to bring something better
tomorrow night.
I hate it here, Lindy.
He hits me, and she yells at me.
I don't want to stay.
Can't I come live with you?
I don't know how Mrs. LaHaye
would feel about that.
And even if she were okay with it...
Mr. And Mrs. Pettis probably
wouldn't let her take you.
I miss you somethin' awful.
Let's run away from here right now.
Jacob, you know we can't leave.
Even if we could leave...
how would Papa find us?
Least this way, the orphanage
can tell him we were sent here.
I promise I'll get you out of here, Jacob.
It just can't be tonight.
You're gonna leave me again?
I'll never leave you
longer than I have to.
I'll be back tomorrow. Okay?
At least you're safe, thank God.
Look, it is late
and we are both exhausted...
so we will talk about this
in the morning.
Now go to bed, Belinda.
Last night wasn't the first time
you sneaked out, was it?
I want to know where you went
and why you stole food.
Members of a family
need to trust each other.
- So?
- I don't understand.
What do you want?
I have to stay here.
If you don't want me,
I can find work somewhere.
I'm a hard worker.
All I ask for is food and a bed.
Belinda, I want you.
My family wants you.
And I'm not gonna send you to work
when you should go to school and be a child.
I ain't been a child for a long time.
I'm worried about her safety.
I'll keep a close watch over her, of course,
but I can't stay up all night, every night.
And if she's determined to sneak out,
she's going to just do it.
Instead of trying to stop something
you can't stop, just let her go and...
- Let her go? Have you lost your mind?
- You didn't let me finish.
Let her go and follow her.
See what this is all about.
It may be nothing. She could be sneaking out
just to prove she doesn't have to stay with you.
- Or...
- Or it could be something serious.
Something dangerous, even.
There's only one way to find out.
-
- Shh.
What are you doing here?
Same thing you are. Finding out
what that little girl's doing.
Brought peaches.
Oh, boy. Ain't had nothing
like this in a long time.
- How are you doing?
- He hit me again.
I didn't do nothin'.
I just didn't move fast enough when
Mrs. Pettis told me to fetch somethin'.
Jacob, I'll get you out of here
just as soon as I can.
I hope that's soon, Lindy.
Good night, Jacob.
Belinda, why have you been
sneaking out to see Jacob?
And why are you bringing him food?
We need the truth now, Belinda.
It'll be better for you to get it all out.
Jacob looked thinner
than when I saw him the last time.
Are Mr. And Mrs. Pettis
treating him right?
- We need the real story.
- It's not a story! It's true!
They're being real mean to Jacob!
What's Jacob's last name?
Is it Marshall?
Is Jacob your brother?
Belinda,
why did you keep this a secret?
At the other towns
the train stopped at...
I saw brothers and sisters
having a real hard time.
Most folks only want one kid.
And others feel bad
about breaking up families...
so they don't take any kid.
I would have taken both of you,
Belinda.
You say that now, but you know you
wouldn't have wanted more than one kid.
Jacob had a better chance on his own.
Why?
'Cause he's younger.
Folks want younger kids.
Once you get to be around my age,
it's harder to find people that'll take 'em.
You need to go to bed.
But I promise you, Belinda...
we will go over there first thing
tomorrow morning and I will talk...
Mrs. LaHaye, may I speak to you
outside, please?
Go to bed.
Why did you stop me? I was going to tell her
that we'll go get her brother out of there.
That's why I stopped you.
I didn't want to get her hopes up.
So you think that I won't do what I said?
No. I know you'll try to do
exactly what you said.
But when Mr. And Mrs. Pettis took Jacob,
they got legal guardianship.
And unless we can prove that he's being
seriously hurt, no court will interfere.
- So you're not going to do anything?
- I'll check the situation out.
But I gotta be careful how I handle this.
- I don't wanna make Hank so mad
that he takes it out on Jacob.
- Well, I'm going with you.
- No, you're not.
- You can't stop me.
You be in my office at 8:00 sharp.
- I won't wait a minute longer.
- I'll be there.
Belinda Marshall...
you are an amazing girl...
and I love you very much.
Just wanna see the boy, Hank.
-  We know you've been mistreating him.
- You watch your mouth!
Let us see the boy, and we'll leave.
Come on out here, boy.
You just stay right here.
Jacob, I'm Sheriff Tyler,
and this is Mrs. LaHaye.
Lindy's foster mama?
Yes. Your sister's very worried
about you, Jacob.
She believes that Mr. And Mrs. Pettis
aren't feeding you enough...
and that they're working you too hard.
Is that true, Jacob?
- Don't be afraid of him.
We won't let him hurt you.
- Has he laid a hand on you?
Are they feeding you enough?
You said you were going to bring him to church.
Why haven't you done that?
That's enough.
You got your answers, Sheriff. Now git.
Hyah!
Hyah!
- I wanted to ask them why they
aren't sending Jacob to school.
- No law says they have to.
- But...
- Even parents, let alone guardians...
don't have to send their kids to school.
That's just wrong.
Jacob needs an education if he's
going to have any kind of future.
Unless we can persuade Pettis of that...
Jacob's future's on that farm.
You don't understand how desperately
Belinda and Jacob love each other...
what it means to be separated
from someone you love that deeply.
I don't think you've ever felt that way
about anyone in your life...
or else you wouldn't let that happen.
- Whoa!
-
Did you see Jacob? Is he okay?
Is he gonna come live here?
Belinda, I'm sorry.
Sheriff Tyler and I talked to Mr. Pettis,
but Jacob’s gonna have to stay there for now.
Our papa's gonna come for us, and he's gonna
get Jacob away from that terrible man!
And he's gonna take
both of us home with him!
For those of you in the second-grade primer,
please open your books to page 13.
For the rest of you, you can continue
doing your multiplication tables.
Belinda.
Will you open your book to page 13?
I would like for you to read aloud.
"The T... Tales...
"Of Pete...
Peter Ra... Ra... '
Rabbit.
You're doing very well. Go on.
- I can't read it.
- You could try.
I don't want to!
All right, class.
That's enough for today.
We will pick up tomorrow
where we left off.
You're excused.
She doesn't want to be part of a family.
She really resents me.
Maybe even hates me.
You and I didn't take
to each other at first. Remember?
- And I am so ashamed about how I resented you.
- It's perfectly natural.
You'd lost your mama and didn't want me to
take her place. Just like with your papa and me.
I'd lost my husband
and didn't want Clark to take his place.
But then you fell in love with Papa
and things changed.
I fell in love with both of you.
Belinda has so much anger in her.
She's had it much harder than I did.
Which is exactly why she needs you.
Even if she's not ready to admit it right now,
she needs what you have to give.
But I have so little to give. I can barely keep
enough food on the table for Maddy and me.
Those other parents
that adopted those children...
they have so much to offer.
You will leave Belinda
a legacy of character...
and of a love for others, and of faith.
That's a beautiful legacy.
That's the kind of legacy that lasts.
Well, we've gone through
all the books at school...
and all the books here...
and you can't seem to find anything
that you're interested in.
There must be something
that you want to be able to read.
Well...
when my pa dropped me and Jacob
off at the orphanage...
he pinned this letter to my dress.
- I was supposed to give it to 'em, but I kept it.
- Why?
These are his last words to us.
They're important.
I just know it's gonna say how much
he loved us and wanted to keep us...
and how he'll come back for us someday.
- Will you read it to me?
- Oh...
Belinda, this letter is private.
It's between you children
and your papa.
I can teach you how to read it.
Okay, I'll learn how to read.
But will you just read it to me now?
All right.
"To Whom It May Concern...
"This is to certify
that the biological father...
"and only legal guardian
of Belinda and Jacob Marshall...
"freely and of his own will...
"requests
that the Children's Aid Society...
"provide a home for his minor children
until they are of age.
"Samuel Marshall promises...
"not to...
"interfere...
"in any arrangements...
"the Children's Aid Society
may make for them.
Sincerely..."
Uh, your father put his mark.
Is that all?
I'm so sorry, Belinda.
I know it must have been very difficult
for your father to give up you and Jacob.
Last one to the swimmin' hole's
a rotten egg!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mrs. LaHaye, what's wrong?
I lost my locket.
The chain must have broken.
- Is it valuable?
- Yes.
I'm sorry. My mother gave it to me
a long time ago, and it is very dear to me.
Let me help you look for it.
Thank you.
It's starting to get dark out here.
We can look again tomorrow.
There's no point.
It's gone.
-
-
- Some of this?
- Cake? I'll take the biggest piece I can get.
You oughta be out there, Sheriff.
Aw, I'm not much of a dancer.
It's not how good you are. It's just an excuse
to wrap your arms around a pretty girl.
Why don't you ask her to dance?
- You're just all right!
-  You're moving all right yourself!
-
-  Well, maybe I will.
I love that cobbler.
I'll see you later.
Mrs. LaHaye, may I have this dance?
Mrs. LaHaye?
I, um... I got some...
A peddler came through town
the other day, and I got this for you.
I know it won't replace the one your mother
gave you, but maybe it might make you feel better.
Zach, this looks like real gold.
Well, if it isn't, I got taken.
There's enough room for two pictures...
Maddy's and Belinda's.
I can't accept this.
- It's just a gift. It doesn't mean anything.
- That's just it.
I could only accept an expensive gift
like this if it did mean something...
if it came from a man that I love.
Could I be such a man?
No.
I know, sweetheart.
I just never wanted to feel this way again.
It was so much easier
when I didn't feel anything.
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem
like God put us on this Earth...
to have it easy.
But he did put us here
to love one another.
I'm so ashamed of myself.
I have two children at home to think of,
and I'm acting like a child myself.
You're not acting like a child.
You're acting like a woman in love.
I have to get home to the children.
- If there's anything your father
and I can do to help...
- Thank you, Mama.
Thank you.
Mrs. LaHaye?
There's somethin' l...
I need to tell you.
You asked me a while back
why I care so much about Belinda.
See, she reminds me of someone.
Someone you loved?
Eleanor. Ellie.
We grew up together.
Her daddy was the town drunk.
And when he wasn't passed out...
he was just full of meanness...
and he took it out on her.
Nobody did anything?
No.
Then when I finally got big enough,
l... I stood up to him.
- What happened?
- Well, let's just say he didn't hit her again.
Did you marry Ellie?
I was going to.
- What happened?
- Bank robbery.
She wasn't a threat in any way.
They didn't have to kill her.
But they did, and...
and they got away with it.
They're alive, and...
Ellie's dead.
Just no rhyme or reason to it.
Zach, I'm so sorry.
I understand your bitterness
toward God.
I felt the same way once.
My husband, Willie, was the sheriff
in the town that we lived in.
He was killed in the line of duty.
How did it happen?
It was stupid really.
-  Darlin'!!
- Couple of men in a saloon got into a fight.
Willie went in to break it up.
Should have ended with nothing worse
than a black eye or two and a broken nose...
but...
one of the men pulled out a gun.
He was dead by the time I got there.
I didn't even have a chance
to say good-bye.
I'm so sorry, Missie.
You must have loved him very much.
With all of my heart and soul.
We're just about done.
Sure goes fast
when you're not doing it alone.
Grandma! Mama! Come quick!
One of the puppies won't wake up!
Aw. Poor little thing.
- Can I hold him for a minute?
- Yeah.
You're all right now. You're all right.
Belinda! How did you do that?
Belinda?
Belinda? Oh, Belinda.
You just did an amazing thing.
What's the matter?
Mama didn't only have Jacob and me.
There was a baby girl.
Jenny.
I'm so sorry, honey.
I tried to take care of baby Jenny...
and to keep her warm
and to get her milk...
e-even though we didn't
have much money.
How old were you, Belinda?
Eight.
That is far too big a responsibility
for a little girl.
There wasn't anyone else to do it.
What happened to Jenny?
She got sick...
and we couldn't afford a doctor.
So one day she just...
stopped breathing, and...
and I tried to do
what Mama told me to do...
like with the puppy...
but it didn't work.
It's all my fault Jenny died!
Belinda, listen to me. Sometimes
things happen... terrible things.
And there is nothing
that we can do about it.
You don't understand.
- Yes, I do.
- How can you?
Because I lost a baby too.
Her name was Kathy.
She was so very precious to me.
What happened to her?
She just stopped breathing.
I don't know why.
One minute she was in her cradle asleep,
and then the next she...
- It wasn't your fault.
- I felt like it was.
I felt like there must have been
some way that I could save her...
just like you thought
that you could save Jenny.
But we couldn't.
It was out of our hands.
It was in God's hands.
I couldn't save Jenny...
and you couldn't save Kathy.
But we can save Jacob.
I'm going to bring
you and Maddy home now.
- Then what?
- Then I am going to get Jacob.
-
-
Sheriff!
What is it? Is somethin' wrong?
I think Mrs. LaHaye may be in trouble,
and it's all my fault. I made her go out there.
- Go where?
- To get Jacob! But she's all alone,
and that man is so mean.
- I'm afraid he might hurt her.
- You go on home, Belinda.
- B-But, Sheriff...
- I'll take care of this.
But I can't worry about you, too,
so go on home and stay there.
If anything happens to Mrs. LaHaye...
Nothing's gonna happen to her.
I won't let it.
All right.
What is it this time, Mrs. LaHaye?
- Where's Jacob?
- None of your damn business, that's where.
Let him come with me.
He needs to be with his sister.
Surely you can see that, Mr. Pettis.
All I know is I got a good hand.
You can hire someone.
A grown man could do much more work
than that little boy can.
Men don't work for nothin'.
That boy does.
Search your heart, Mr. Pettis.
I know that somewhere deep inside,
you must feel something for him.
Well, now, that's where you're wrong,
Mrs. LaHaye.
You are a cruel and selfish man...
and I am not going to let Jacob
spend one more day in your power!
And just what do you think
you can do about it? Huh?
You come on to my land,
threatening me.
I'm within my rights
to do whatever I want to you!
- Even the law can't say otherwise.
- Let go of me!
- Let her go, Hank!
- Nobody tells me what to do on my own land!
You let her go.
You can't arrest me for defending myself
on my own property!
If we weren't on your property,
you'd be heading to jail right now.
Either way, you shoot anyone here
or anywhere else, I will arrest you.
We'll let the courts decide
whether it's right or wrong.
- Mrs. LaHaye, come on.
- But what about Jacob?
- Can't do anything about him right now.
-
Whoa. Whoa.
He shot at you.
Why didn't you arrest him?
Well, that was just a warning shot.
He wanted to hit me,
he would have hit me.
You were trespassing on his land, Missie.
By law, you should have
been the one arrested.
Where's Jacob?
I'm sorry, Belinda,
but we couldn't get him away.
Why not?
We don't have the legal right.
- What about Jacob’s rights?
- Look, I am not giving up.
I promise you
that I will get Jacob back.
Whoa.
- Hey, Mama.
- Where's Belinda?
She came in, grabbed her stuff
and left through the back door.
Oh, no. Stay here.
Belinda?
Belinda?
She's gone. She took all of her things,
and she's not coming back this time.
Well, she won't leave without Jacob.
- I'll go to the Pettis place.
- I'm coming.
No. Go home and wait for her.
If my husband sees you,
he'll run you off again.
I think Belinda might've come for Jacob.
You're wrong.
He's in the barn, feeding the cow.
- I'd like to check, if you don't mind.
-
What are you doing back here?
- The boy's run off.
-
All right, everybody.
Let's gather round.
I have no idea where these kids might be
going, so we'll go in different directions.
I'll go north. Clark, you go east.
Anderson, you go south.
Missie, you go west.
Pastor, if you don't mind, go back to the
church in case the kids seek refuge there.
Let's everybody meet back here
by sundown.
- Let's go by Anderson Pass.
- That's it.
Taking the county road? All right.
Let's go, boys.
Hyah!
Belinda!
Jacob!
Belinda!
No one found them?
We have to go back out.
- No.
- But they can't stay out there.
Not in the dark, alone in the storm!
Zach's right, Missie. It's too dark to look
for 'em now. We have to wait until dawn.
Belinda's a smart, tough little girl.
She'll find shelter for her and Jacob.
What if there is no shelter where they are?
What if there's a wash?
They don't know it's not safe
because of flash floods.
It'll be no help to them
if you get lost too.
Maddy needs you. Stay with him.
We'll talk to more parishioners, arrange
for a search party to go out in the morning.
We'll stay with you tonight, Missie.
I'll stay with you.
I'm so scared, Papa.
All right. Let's go, boys.
- All right, Clancy. You ready?
- Right behind you.
Let's go.
Okay. Hyah!
Jacob! Up there. Come on!
-
-
It's okay, Jacob. It's all right.
We're just gonna stay here
till the rain stops.
What'll we do then?
Where do we go?
Don't worry, okay? I've got a plan.
Belinda! Jacob!
Belinda!
Jacob!
Let's pray.
Dear Lord, please give those little children
the strength and the courage...
to make it through this dark night.
And give us the faith
to accept your will.
- Amen.
- Amen.
I don't know
if you can hear me or not, God.
I'm not sure I even believe in you.
But I know I can't find
those children without you.
Hear my prayer, Lord.
I'm so cold.
Jacob? Belinda!
Over here! We're over here!
Keep talking, Belinda.
I'll follow your voice.
Over here! We're over here!
-  Sheriff Tyler?
- Yes.
You're safe now.
I'm gonna get you back.
- Back to Mr. Pettis?
- No, son.
Home, to Missie's.
Why don't you come inside?
Zach...
there are no words that can begin to describe
the depth of my gratitude.
None are necessary, Missie.
So, what happens now?
Does Jacob have to go back to Pettis?
No. No, we talked on the ride back...
and he admitted to me that Hank's been
beating him and practically starving him.
I'm gonna tell Hank, if he doesn't voluntarily
give up his legal guardianship of him...
I'll arrest him.
I don't think that Belinda and Jacob
should be separated again.
I would like for him
to come and live with us.
I think the Children's Aid Society
will go along with that.
I can't believe
that you found them in that storm...
all by yourself.
Hmm.
I wasn't alone out there, Missie.
What do you mean?
I thought that you rode out by yourself.
Yeah, I searched for hours,
calling them over and over again.
It got to the point
where I felt hopeless.
I knew I would never find them
on my own.
So I prayed to God for help.
Oh. Zach.
And then I was absolutely silent,
and in that silence...
I heard what I couldn't hear
while I was riding, calling them.
- What?
- A child crying.
The thing is is even standing still...
I shouldn't have heard
that little voice over the storm.
Maybe it wasn’t Jacob’s voice you heard.
You spoke to God...
and he answered you.
With a miracle.
When did you start coming here, Pa?
When your mama died.
This is where I said good-bye.
How do you do that?
How do you let go
of someone you love?
When we love someone...
that love doesn't die when they do.
That stays in our hearts forever.
But we do have to say good-bye
to the life we shared with them...
go on with a new life...
a chance at happiness.
Willie would want me to be happy.
Mm-hmm.
I know that.
He'd approve of Zach.
He's a good man.
- But it feels like a betrayal.
- It isn't.
And it doesn't matter
how I tell you that.
You're gonna have to feel it, Missie.
I think I'm gonna
go on back to the house.
You want to sit here for a while?
Mmm.
I'll always love you, Willie.
But I am finally ready
to be happy again.
Good-bye, sweetheart.
Do you still have that locket?
Why, yes. Right here.
If you still want to give it to me,
I'll take it.
But you said you couldn't accept
a gift like that.
Unless it came
from someone that I loved.
Will you put it on me, Zach?
Gladly.
There's something else I couldn't do
unless it was with the man I love.
- Yea! Whoo!
-
I wish you happiness!
-  Bye, darlin'!!
- Bye-bye!
I love you!
Come on, you guys. Come on. Let's go.
Bye!
-  Bye. Be good.
- Bye!
Bye-bye.
-
- Bye, Missie!
