Building a railroad that
long is somebody's crazy dream.
It's a
wonderful age we live in.
A railroad
from Omaha to California?
One might as well think of flying.
President Lincoln is for it.
This is the
most monumental folly...
ever conceived in the mind of man.
In all this broad land of ours...
who wants this railroad...
that will start at the
outer edge of civilization...
and wander expensively
through the wilderness?
Who, I ask you, except a small group...
of money-grabbing financiers,
self-seeking politicians...
and fanatical engineers?
Mr.
President. Mr. President.
Does the Senator yield
to the gentleman from California?
I am not done, Mr. President.
I would like to read...
from a speech by the late
Daniel Webster on this subject.
Delivered from this very floor.
"What do we want with this
vast, worthless area...
"this region of savages
and wild beasts...
"of deserts and endless mountain ranges?
"What can we ever hope
to do with 3000 miles...
"of cheerless rockbound coast...
"and not a harbor on it?"
Not a harbor on it?
Order! Order!
Why, there's room
in the San Francisco Bay...
to float all the navies of the world.
His word against Webster's.
Mr. President. Mr. President.
Mr. Sargent.
Gentlemen. The learned Senator asks...
Who wants this railroad?
Well, I'll tell you.
This nation, crippled by
four years of war, wants it.
A great artery...
through which may flow the
gold and silver of the West...
into the empty treasuries of the East.
Grain and cattle
into a war-torn South.
And thousands of men
released from both armies...
want it for the work and
the wages it will bring.
And the merchants of the whole world...
who need a shorter route
to the Orient, they want it.
Gentlemen...
I move you the adoption
of this railroad bill...
that shall bind us
together, East and West...
forever as one people.
Mr. Ames...
I want to take a ride
on this railroad...
the first thing after I
retire from the presidency.
Mr. Lincoln had the
vision to conceive this railroad.
You gentlemen must have the
vision to help us finance it.
Frankly, Mr. Ames,
the only vision I can see...
is a lot of loose dollars
rolling away over those prairies.
Good day, gentlemen.
But there's more than profit...
in the lap of this undertaking.
This railroad is the
future of the United States.
Along its rails, new cities will rise.
Is there not some danger
that the Central Pacific...
which is building east across
California, may reach Ogden first...
and keep you out of
the Salt Lake Valley?
President Lincoln wisely arranged...
that the Central Pacific will build
only to the California state line.
Here, where our tracks
will join with theirs.
General Dodge, uh...
as Chief Engineer of
the Union Pacific...
are you quite sure that a railroad
more than 1000 miles long...
can actually be built
through such a wilderness?
Yes. Yes. My brother Oliver and I...
are staking our fortune
on General Dodge's word...
that it can be done.
How much of your fortune, Mr. Ames?
We'll back the Union Pacific down
to the last shovel in our factory.
You're enthusiastic.
I promised Mr. Lincoln
to see it through.
Mr. Lincoln is dead. Well,
my promise to him is not dead.
Splendid, Mr. Ames, splendid.
I'm beginning to see a golden
harvest in these iron rails.
Then you are with us?
My hand on it.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Barrows.
On the contrary, I am indebted to
you for showing me the fortune...
there is to be made out of Union
Pacific. Good day, gentlemen.
Good day, sir.
Good luck, General Dodge.
Good luck.  Goodbye, all.
Goodbye, sir.
Who is Barrows?
The biggest moneybag in Chicago.
He makes them and breaks them out there.
I never thought he'd join you.
What do you think would happen
if the Central Pacific...
should build all the way to
Ogden in the Salt Lake Valley?
It would bust the Union
Pacific higher than a kite.
Much higher.
But he said that Lincoln had
arranged for the Central to stop...
at the California
border. Lincoln is dead...
and there are those in Washington who
do not wish the Union Pacific well.
Can't both lines have
terminals in Ogden? No, Whipple.
You miss the point.
The Union Pacific has
authority to build only...
to where it meets the Central. Well?
And if the Central should
pass through Ogden first...
and meet the Union in the wilds
of the Wasatch Mountains...
Yes. Exactly.
The Union would have
and a gopher hole for
its Western terminal.
Splendid.
We'll sell Union stock
short and buy Central.
We'll make millions, Mr.
Barrows. A golden opportunity.
Pure gold. Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.
But suppose the Union
Pacific gets to Ogden first?
It won't, Whipple.
I can assure you.
It won't.
# They call me
the rose of St. Louis #
# The rose of this river town #
##
Gentleman to see you, boss.
Mr. Barrows.
Bring in a bottle of
that extra-dry champagne.
Yes sir, extra dry.
Take a seat.
Oh. Rose...
# They call me the Rose of St. Louis ##
Sit down.
We ain't had the pleasure of
seeing you here before, Mr...
Interesting decorations.
Only one like it in St. Louis.
I suppose you brought the
idea with you from Panama.
Panama?
This biography of yourself, written by
the best detective agency in Chicago.
What's on your mind, mister?
How's that partner of
mine doing? Very good, sir.
Mr. Campeau...
in the past, your operations
have always been, shall we say...
of a minor nature.
Do you think you could manage the
biggest gambling outfit in America?
Do you think you could
handle 10,000 workmen...
with plenty of money...
out in the wilderness?
Supplying them with liquor...
and any excitement the devil can brew?
Do you think you could keep them drunk
and discontented, month after month?
Go on.
Excuse me, Mr. Allen.
Mr. Campeau would admire to
see you in the other room.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Al. Al Brett...
take over.
It's your deal.
It means keeping your tent with its many
diversions at the end of the track...
as it moves West...
and selling the tracklayers all the
trouble they'll buy. You'll be protected.
What's the split? None. You take it all.
Including orders from me.
What kind of orders?
They will all add up the same. Delay.
Anything... I might say everything...
to delay the building of
the Union Pacific Railroad.
Why not?
Longer it takes, the more money I make.
Mr. Barrows, this is
my partner, Dick Allen.
Late of the Union Army...
but never late with a gun.
He'll be very handy, I assure you.
I've been making a deal with
your partner. A big deal.
We're leaving St. Louis.
For where and for
what? West, Mr. Allen...
for excitement and profit.
All right. Deal me in.
Where's my drink?
Here. I don't use it.
No?
Never take another man's drink.
It's bad luck.
Well, gentlemen...
here's to...
whatever it is.
'Tis that cottonwood you're feeding him.
He won't eat it.
It gives him a pain in his boiler.
Hey, Monahan.
Do you want I should spell you a
bit, Monahan. In case you fall asleep?
Mollie Monahan, will you come down
out of that before some Indian...
beats me to the pleasure of killing you.
I brought you supper.
Suppose you fell off, and
I had to stop the train.
If you were half the dutiful daughter...
that this engine is to me...
Hold your whist. Here's your bite.
Heavens above. What's
in it? Coupling pins?
Cartridges. I forgot to
put them in your valise.
Get back to the caboose, you brat.
Twenty hours to Cheyenne...
and I'm supposed to
live on powder and lead.
I think you've been eating dynamite.
Good night, Mr. Barley.
Good night, Mollie.
Down.
I want it up. No. Down.
I said up.
Now listen, lady...
I want some fresh air.
Sure, and you'll get it,
right through your skull.
The Indians relish shooting
at the lighted windows.
That woman, she's just
like my wife I had in Omaha.
You know my wife, she's so mean...
she barks like the dogs, but me, well...
you know what I do? You married her.
Oh, sure. You bet yourself.
The best in the whole world.
Mollie.
But I look around and...
pretty soon I marry my wife in Santa Fe.
The best woodchopper in the country.
You bet you my life, the best.
But one day she gets
bite by a rattlesnake.
She did? Yeah.
Did the doctor get there in
time? No, she's already dead.
Your wife? My wife?
No, no, the snake. My wife...
My wife, the next day, she's
so angry, she bites her brother.
Sure...
and his whole family is poisoned.
And, anyhow, I'm
already gone to Yuma...
and there I marry Carmelita.
Now what did you marry her for?
You think to cook for me?
No. To chop me firewood? No.
Well, what did she do?
She...
Yes, sir. Carmelita sure is a honey.
Yeah.
Hey, what you know?
Leach, what you do here anyhow?
Hunting for you.
General Dodge wants to
see us back in his car.
At the rate you're going, Leach,
General Dodge won't live that long.
New troubleshooter is getting
aboard, somewheres hereabout.
Thanks, Sergeant. Good luck.
General Dodge aboard, Conductor?
Yep. If you're Jeff Butler,
he's looking for you.
I'll report, soon as I wash
off some of the prairie.
Yeah. A fella gets
kind of sweaty riding.
Campeau's crowd's in this car, Mollie.
##
Rattlesnakes.
No self-respecting rattlesnake
would ride with them.
##
##
Mollie.
Mollie Monahan.
Dick.
Sure, Dick, they told me
you'd not be back this year.
Did you think you'd
get rid of me that easy?
Something's dead.
Easy.
We'll bury him when the time comes.
Every minute that passed
had your name on it.
Oh, that's easy to listen
to, but hard to believe.
Me father said... That
he doesn't like gamblers.
Neither do I.
Here you are practicing to fleece
the poor lambs at the End of Track.
Marry me, Mollie, and I'll reform.
You haven't changed a bit.
Except maybe for the worse.
You're in love with her
and her three sisters.
You've got cards in your blood.
And you in my heart.
Go along with your soft talk.
You'll die with your boots on...
and your four ladies won't
be walking behind you.
Would you walk behind me?
Would be safer than walking
beside you to the altar.
All the pasteboard ladies in the world
aren't worth one of your little fingers...
with a ring on it.
I'd better be getting back
to the caboose. No. Not yet.
Turn your back to me.
Close your eyes. Both of them.
Turn your head away.
This is to keep your heart
warm for your wedding day.
Oh. 'Tis never for me.
Not if it doesn't fit. Oh, it'll fit.
It is the most beautiful thing ever was.
But far too grand for a
poor engineer's daughter.
Not that Monahan's a poor engineer.
He's the best there is, but...
I suppose a good engineer's
daughter can get...
just as cold as a poor
engineer's daughter.
And a gambler can love you
just as much as a saint.
We might as well face the facts.
Central Pacific has not stopped at
the California state line as agreed.
They're over the Sierras,
and they've surveyed...
right through to Salt Lake and Ogden.
What do you think? But
they've got an agreement!
The devil himself is against us!
And what
happens to the people...
who backed us with their savings?
Busted. And so are we.
We're going to reach Ogden first.
Well, the Central will be there in 10
months. Then we'll be there in nine.
Look at the map, General Dodge.
We've built only 516
miles in three years.
And we're still 500 miles from Ogden.
And we're still going
to get there first. What?
Over the Rockies and Wasatch Mountains
with Indians claiming your food supply?
Only the Irish could do
it. And I doubt if they can.
Good news or bad? Good.
We had a council at Broken Bow.
Red Cloud says the Indians'll
lay off the railroad...
if the whites will lay off the Indians.
Captain Butler served with me in
the war. He's just signed on with us.
Meet the two gentlemen
you'll be working for.
General Casement, in charge
of tracklaying. How are you?
How do you do, sir? Mr. Reed.
You tell him what your job is, Sam.
I see that the tracklayers don't
catch up with the graders...
the graders don't catch
up with the tie cutters...
the tie cutters don't catch up with
the tunnel and bridge builders...
and the lunatic asylum
doesn't catch up with me.
My job, sir?
To establish and maintain order
along the entire right-of-way.
Troubleshooter, huh?
Yeah, and there's plenty of it.
What's the worst problem?
Sid Campeau.
His whiskey and cards and what goes
with them follow the End of Track...
like a flock of vultures.
They've cost us a life every day.
Men drugged, robbed, murdered.
Crews disrupted by hired agitators.
Leach Overmile and Fiesta
here have been assigned to you.
They can tell you how Campeau operates.
I don't believe I'll need bodyguards.
Oh, no? You'll need them, all right.
You think we no good, eh?
No. It's not that, I...
We've had a lot of experience, Captain.
We bodyguarded the last
two troubleshooters...
right up till the very
minute they was killed.
We'll get along all right.
There's just one
question I'd like to ask, General.
Yes? What's the limit?
None.
Because our town's on wheels,
we've no civil law out here.
You're the law. And it's up to you to
smash anything that threatens to delay us.
That's all the orders
there are. Yes, sir.
I declare, he seems like
a right nice young fella.
I hope he lives long enough
so as we can get acquainted.
Hey, what's moving? You are.
Oh, am I, now? Yep.
Lady, you're on a brake wheel,
and one whistle means turn it.
Are you running this
train all by yourself?
No, but passengers aren't allowed on
the platform while the train's moving.
Passengers. Me?
You poor tenderfoot.
The new troubleshooter's
looking for you, Mr. Campeau.
For what?
I don't know. Heading this way, though.
Keep an eye on him.
Al.
Al Brett, Cordray.
Rose, you and Mame better get
to the other end of the car.
A lady can't get no rest.
A lady don't need none.
Sit down and keep your eyes open.
Dick.
Sit down, Mollie, and keep low.
Why? What's going on?
Campeau's expecting company.
That's him.
Wait here.
Lonesome, handsome?
Jeff Butler. Dick.
You old dogcatcher.
You old chicken thief.
Remember the last time
I saw you in Philadelphia...
Baltimore... Oh, now wait.
We started celebrating our discharge
from the Army in New York...
and we came up for air in Philadelphia.
I put you to bed in Baltimore,
and I woke up in Washington.
Old army pals, huh?
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be alive.
Jeff, this is Sid Campeau.
I've heard of Mr. Campeau.
This is Mr. Brett and Mr.
Cordray. Captain Butler.
Howdy. Hello.
Howdy.
You old sharpshooter.
What are you doing here?
I'm working for the railroad.
Doing what? I'm assistant
superintendent of the...
Just a fancy name for troubleshooter?
Maybe.
It looks like we'd see
quite a lot of each other...
for a while.
I was figuring on having
a little talk with you.
Maybe you'd better have a little
talk with your friend here first.
Tell your playmates they
can sit easy for a while.
Same old Jeff.
This is my seat, and this is
Miss Mollie Monahan. Jeff Butler.
Sit down, Jeff.
Jeff and I fought, bled and died
together, all during the war.
It wasn't you two that
won the war, was it?
Practically.
How much of a friend of
yours is Campeau? Sid?
He's my partner.
You'd better get yourself
another partner, Dick.
I've already got my eye on one.
Oh.
Is it another slap you're
asking for, Mr. Butler?
Darling, will you kindly
hold your temper...
your tongue, and your two
little fists. They ain't little.
You can't fight Mollie and live.
She's the postmistress at End of Track.
The eyes and tongue of 1000 men
who never learned to read or write.
She belongs to the railroad.
Although you'd think the
railroad belonged to her.
What about Campeau?
What about him?
Part of my job is to clear him
and his outfit off the line.
No, you can't do it, Jeff.
Don't try.
We've been through a lot
of storms together, Dick.
We've slept under the same
blanket, eaten off the same plate.
Join up with me again.
I'm standing pat and liking it.
Well, I'm afraid we're in
different armies this time.
You think there'll be a
rope around my neck someday?
Maybe.
Sure now, that's a crazy way for
two friends to be saying hello.
Hey, what's that? Hey, look.
The Injun boy, he race the iron horse.
Monahan will bust his boiler
if the Injun keeps up with him.
Come on, Indian boy.
Open up, Monahan.
Say, he's cute.
Now, Bessie.
$5, I get him on my first shot.
You're on.
He's going to beat us.
Oh, no, he won't.
What did he do that for?
Oh, that's a shame.
Pay up.
That ain't
nothing. Why you all...
Look out, Brett.
Get out of the way.
No, Dick.
Everybody just stay in their seats.
Just keep eating your vittles,
Mr. Campeau, with both hands.
Use your feet.
You weasel.
One at a time, gentlemen,
you'll all get your turn.
There's the man. Now,
what's going on here?
What are you fellas trying
to... Conductor, stop the train.
One of my men got thrown off.
Thrown off? Where? Don't
pull that cord, Conductor.
But Mr. Campeau said...
This train doesn't stop.
All right.
That shot didn't just kill an Indian.
It killed a dozen white men, and
scalped and tortured women and children.
Tsk.
What's a dead Indian, more or less?
The Army's been killing them for years.
The Army doesn't kill
Indians for fun, Campeau.
And I don't think you do, either.
He's sure gonna be unpopular.
Not with me.
Get along.
Thank you kindly. Good
day to you, Shamus.
Good day, Paddy.
'Tis news of me wife I've
come for, Mollie Monahan.
I've no letter for you, Paddy.
Why don't you send for her?
I've all but $20 of the passage money.
I'm on me way to the
Big Tent to win that.
Sure, Paddy, you fool.
You can't win at Campeau's.
I can't lose.
Only this morning...
I found this shamrock in
a prayer book she sent me.
Now, the shamrock's not
for that kind of luck.
Wait till you see.
One man's money is as
good as another's in the Big Tent.
Step right in, my friends.
If you don't feel
like taking a chance...
there's plenty of
dancing, at $1 a couple.
$1 a couple and there's
sweet music on the house.
Step right up, my friends,
and enjoy your luck.
##
Don't lean on my chair.
It's bad luck. Get away.
It's not your rightful card.
You took it off the bottom.
Say that again.
I'll clout it into your thieving head.
Stay where you are.
With me own two eyes...
I saw you slip it off...
You dirty blackguard.
The music. It stopped right with it.
Jeff.
Nothing I can do for him.
Where's his gun? He had none...
and he couldn't shoot one if he had.
Who got plugged?
Just some Irish tracklayer.
Is he dead yet?
I don't know.
Who was it? Oh, the pity of it all.
It was Paddy O'Rourke.
One side, gentlemen,
please. Easy there.
Paddy.
Paddy O'Rourke.
The letter, Mollie. It came?
The letter?
From Nora.
Yes, Paddy.
Paddy's letter.
Could you be reading it to me?
Sure, Paddy.
Paddy, my darling...
my...
my heart's so full of
love for you, sure...
sure 'tis spilling out of me eyes.
'Tis such an impatient
husband you are, Paddy, but...
after all the work and worry is done...
we'll be together again.
And there will be no night...
nor day between us...
at all.
"No night...
"nor day between us."
Nora.
A lad lies murdered, and
nothing will be done about it.
From a far country he came...
to do his little part
building the railway.
A great and good thing for us all.
And what will you tell his
widow, you men that run this...
this hell on wheels?
That's what it is.
A hell on wheels that claims a
man's life for every day in the year.
Here's a mite for the widow. Who's next?
Come on you Paddies, put it in the hat.
Twelve, red and even.
Don't touch that money. Why not?
I had that pot won. Maybe.
The hand wasn't played out, was it?
No.  No.
Which was Paddy's hand? This one.
Three treys.
Now deal yourself one.
Off the top.
A busted flush. Paddy wins.
Mollie Monahan. Keep your
hand above the table, Cordray.
I got manners. I'll
pick them up for you.
That belongs to Paddy's widow.
Leach! Take Mollie home.
Just as you say, Jeff, but
these fellas... Go ahead.
It is a fine thing you've done, Mr.
Butler. I'm thanking you for Paddy.
Come on, Mollie.
Clear out of Cheyenne, Cordray,
and keep off the UP right-of-way.
You got a big mouth, bucko.
Better keep it shut.
If you're not out of
this town in an hour...
one of us will keep his
mouth shut for a long time.
Come on, Jeff.
Let's go get a drink.
All right.
Number two. Black, even.
Say, you got eyes in
the back of your head?
I'm glad you keep that mirror clean.
He seen him in the looking glass.
Doctor!
Somebody get that doctor!
When Jeff shoots,
they don't need a doctor...
they need an undertaker.
Come on, boys! Drink up!
Keep your games going,
boys. Hit her up, Joe.
##
Spin that thing, Tom.
Train for End of Track...
pulling out in five minutes.
Come on, Terry.
Not me. I'm staying.
Me, too.
Train for End of Track!
Let's go. I gotta go.
Come on back
for a while. Come on.
Come on, you gandy dancers.
Get out there and go to work.
Board!
Free drinks, boys and girls.
Everybody have a drink on the house.
Free drinks!
Board for End of Track.
There's not many men boarding
your work train, Jeff.
They'll be on it.
Are you going to clean out
the tent all by yourself?
Maybe.
I never thought one glass of
liquor would do that to you, Jeff.
But when the shooting
starts, let me know.
I'll be right over
there, dealing blackjack.
By doggies, I knowed
I'd miss all the fun.
Where's that good luck piece of yours?
Oh, you mean that gold nugget
I picked up out in California?
I got it here somewhere.
I always keep it with my knickknacks.
There it is, right there
in number five, Jeff.
Say, let me tell you how
I happened to pick that up.
How do you know that's real gold?
What do you know about gold nuggets?
Are you doubting that that's gold?
I wonder if there's any old-timer here
that knows real gold when he sees it.
I do.
Take a look at that.
That's gold, all right.
Where'd it come from?
Leach here picked it up at End of Track.
End of Track? A little
mite west of there.
Gold.
At End of Track?
Gold? Who found gold?
Who said "gold"? Gold?
What about gold?
Gold!
Who said "gold"?
They struck gold at End of Track!
He's found gold!
What was that, gold?
Train for End of Track. Board!
They found gold at End of Track.
Come back, you fools!
There's no gold! Come back!
Get them on that train
and keep them there.
I sure will. All right, Jeff.
Come on, Charlie. It's starting!
The shooting's all over,
Dick. Where were you?
That puts you one up on me, bucko.
Bucko's got a nice broad back.
Ain't he?
Hmm.
The way to get him ain't
with a gun. He's too fast.
Get me Duke Ring.
# How I missed
her, how I missed her #
# How I missed my Clementine #
# Here I kissed her little sister #
# Then I forgot... ##
I'm looking for the lovely
postmistress of Hell on Wheels.
And what do you want to see her about?
About one of her little fingers.
The one she put in your eye
the first time you met her?
No. Not that one.
Here, let me see them all.
That's too bad. What's
the matter with them?
No rings.
They'll catch cold. Rings!
Rings don't grow on trees.
Oh, no, not on trees.
But there's a certain weed scientifically
known as the Ringus Weddingbellikus.
Well, upon my soul.
'Tis some more of your black
magic, but gorry it's beautiful.
Grown especially for this finger.
No. You'd be pulling a wedding
bell out from under the next rail.
Well, keep it till your
finger changes its mind.
'Tis too much of a...
'Tis too much of a temptation, but...
the offer deserves thanking.
Wait. And what will the bold
Captain over there be thinking?
Hey!
Hey, hold on
there! Good morning.
Please, and who gave you
the right to use my handcar?
Oh, I thought it belonged
to the railroad. Hello, Dick.
It's mine to deliver
mail at the End of Track.
You going to End of Track? I am.
So am I!
That puts you two up on me, bucko.
Is it that you can't talk when
there's no gun in your hand?
Maybe.
'Tis a fine job you've done
in a few months, Mr. Jeff.
Restoring a bit of order
along the right-of-way.
It must give great pride
to your lady back in...
in Boston.
Is she your wife?
No.
Be like it's some sparrow's
got hold of your heart.
Is she very beautiful? Very.
And does she love you
very much? Very much.
Now how about delivering your mail?
The wind just whisked it out of me hand.
Well, seems a word from her is
more important than your business.
Yes. She's my mother.
Oh, 'tis sorry I am, Mr.
Jeff, and ashamed, besides.
Get back! Get back! Get back to the car!
Gorry, what are we getting
into? Come on, Jeff, run for it!
At least, now, you'll have plenty
of time to read your letter.
Yeah. If one of the
buffalo doesn't want a ride.
Your mother worries a great
deal about you, I'm thinking.
With all the fighting and
killing you're mixed up in.
I didn't know when I started.
What didn't you know?
No, you wouldn't be interested.
Captain, I've reached the point of being
fair crazy trying to understand you.
Mind if I smoke? That's what I mean.
The manners of a gentleman, the smile
of a boy, and the quick hand of a gunman.
Now. Now, however did you get started
on a career of death and destruction?
I couldn't decide between being a pirate
and a fireman, so took up engineering.
Driving an engine?
Get out of there!
No, building bridges and things.
But along came the war...
And they needed your guns
more than your bridges.
My dreams went up in smoke.
Then there's much in
common between us, Mr. Jeff.
How's that, Mollie?
Both of us seem to be wanting
things that don't want us.
You seemed to be getting what you
wanted just before we got on this car.
Oh, Dick.
I know. You think I'm an
outrageous flirt. Well?
But did you never know that
flirting gets into a woman's blood...
like fighting gets into a man's?
Now, a girl begins coquetting
to discover if she has the power.
Then she goes looking, like
a fighter after a bully...
for the hardest man to conquer.
But 'tis never the man she wants...
'tis the pleasure of
bringing him to her feet.
Till the right man comes along and
gives her the spanking she deserves.
That's the man she dreams of.
And the man she kisses.
The buffalo are most gone, and I'm
thinking we'd better be going, too.
We might have harnessed a couple
and had them pull us to End of Track.
Rail!
Rail!
Bend your backs to it!
Lay ahold of
that rail, me lad...
you're slowing us down.
Sure, if I was your mother, I'd be
ashamed of the strength you have.
'Tis the whiskey you
drank in Cheyenne...
not the work you're doing here
that gave you such a thirst.
Get along with you! Any trouble, Dusky?
Trouble?
Say, what was the matter with them crazy
muckers you sent out here the other day?
Why?
All over the hillside they
started digging for gold.
Found plenty iron, huh?
And they're laying three miles
of it a day, pay or no pay.
Hey, what is this I hear about
the railroad brass hats coming up?
Inspection tour. General
Grant's with them.
He'd win a lot of votes
in the next election...
by bringing our pay along with him.
He will.
Come on. Move it ahead.
Here's one to mail,
Mollie. Give it here.
Mollie, did my cousin from
Cork write? No, she didn't.
Any mail, Mollie? It is sorry, I am.
Have you got a letter
for us? No. Mrs. Cassidy.
Saint's alive! Who's dead?
Mrs. Hogan, I hear your
new baby came yesterday.
And a fine broth of a boy he
is, too. Shouldn't you be in bed?
Well, I had a mind to
stay in bed this morning...
but there was the washing to
do, so I says to meself, I says:
"Now, this is no time for playing sick."
What're you going to name the baby?
Union Pacific Hogan. Was
that your husband's idea?
Mike? Sure he's after going
to Cheyenne to celebrate.
The lad'll be half-grown
by the time he sobers up.
Injuns! Get the kids in!
Redskins!
To your posts,
men! Get ready for action!
Hold your fire till they get closer.
There's only two of them.
And they look like my men.
I smell worse trouble than Injuns.
Get back to work, you mollycoddles...
or I'll be banging on somebody's
pants with me pick-handle.
Get back to the job, you terriers!
We got plenty
troubles this time, Captain.
You know that Andy Calahan, the
foreman over at the grader's camp?
Yeah. What about him?
Nothing, only he's dead.
How?
Fella named Duke Ring
sort of lost his temper.
Yeah. Now, nobody's working at all.
But they gotta work.
We can't lay track if there's no grade.
Couple of hundred of them over
there yowling about no pay...
so we didn't start nothing.
I'll go on up and entertain Mr.
Ring. Back by sundown, maybe.
You better take us with you,
Jefferson. That foreman is awful dead.
Dusky! Dusky Clayton!
Would you give me the loan of this
team to take mail to the graders' camp?
That's no place for you
to be going now. Thanks.
Sorry, Mollie. Hey, what's this?
Well, by the soles of me feet!
What're you working for?
It ain't money because
you don't get none.
Are you working for your sweat?
That's all you'll get out of it.
Unless some Injun comes along
and tears the hair off your head.
Whoa.
Give me that.
That's Duke Ring.
You ain't gonna need this.
Oakes Ames would hate to see
his shovels used like that.
Wait here.
'Tis suicide you're contemplating,
going against that mob.
Maybe. Jeff.
No one's ever put any
sense into a man's brain...
through a bullet hole in his head.
Maybe you're right.
Whatever happens...
you keep out of it.
The fool ain't got a gun on him.
Hello, boys!
Where's your foreman?
Your foreman was a fine fellow.
This bruiser taking his place?
What're you going to do about it, bucko?
Nothing, Mr. Ring...
if these men are fools enough to
believe a lying windbag like you.
Lying, am I?
Have you been paid for
two months or ain't you?
No.
Sure, sure. You've all got
wages coming. So have I.
We'll get every cent that's due us.
The railroad won't pay
you for sitting around...
watching Mr. Ring break shovels.
Now, let's go to work.
That sounds like horse sense.
Oh, does it?
I'll kill the first man
to move a shovel of earth.
You'll go out of here feet first, bucko.
I'm not there. I'm over here, Mr. Ring.
I see you, you stinking railroad cop.
Still here, Mr. Ring.
This way, Mr. Ring.
Well, mates, there's your bully.
Nobody can make you work.
But if you're through with the job...
get out of camp and make room
for men who do want to work.
Well, boys, it's 1:00.
That's still horse sense.
What are we waiting for? Come on, boys.
Come on, boys, bring your shovels.
# I've been
working on the railroad #
# All the livelong day #
# I've been working on the railroad #
# Just to pass the time
away # Hit the ties, Ring.
And don't stop to say
goodbye to Campeau.
# Don't you hear the whistle blowing? #
# Rise up so early in the morn #
# Don't you hear the foreman shouting #
# Oh, Dinah, blow your horn #
Gorry, what a man.
# I've been working on the railroad #
# All the livelong ##
Can you see him?
Last time I seen him, I was shooting
at him from a huckleberry patch.
Plenty big talk, but no payroll.
Such a move means
disaster, General Grant.
Our credit is stretched
to the breaking point.
An element, lawless beyond all
reason, hangs onto our coattails...
here at the End of Track.
It's like a monstrous conspiracy
determined to wreck the railroad.
And now Mr. Barrows proposes
a new survey west of Laramie.
Reputable engineers advise me
our present route is impractical.
I'd rather take the
advice of one old buffalo.
A buffalo? Oh, come now, General.
This railroad is being built
on an old buffalo trail.
Those animals are practical
travelers, Mr. Barrows.
And I never knew one that changed
his route for financial reasons.
And we can't do it and reach
Ogden before the Central.
My only concern, General Grant, is
to lay an honest stretch of track.
Mr. Barrows wants
If that is ordered, then I
must resign as Chief Engineer.
But, General Dodge...
The Government expects the company
to finish the railroad as contracted.
It also expects General
Dodge to remain in authority.
Mr. Ames.
How much money do you need
for immediate bills and wages?
At least a million dollars.
You seem to have the interest of the
road so deeply at heart, Mr. Barrows...
I suggest you lend Mr. Ames the money.
A million dollars? Yes.
For the Union Pacific.
I consider it a privilege
to serve the road...
and the next President
of the United States.
The first shipment of cash will
be sent before the week is over.
General. Gentlemen.
Thank you, General. Thank you.
Thank you, General.
It takes money to put iron
over those mountains, General.
Come on in, boys. An
equal cache for one and all.
Can I trouble you for a light, stranger?
Sure.
Shipment of money is coming
in on a special, Tuesday night.
Payroll, huh? Yes. I prefer
that it should not arrive.
How much?
$200,000. My money. I
want most of it back.
We'll get it.
Thank you for the light, stranger.
The money belongs to Barrows.
So it ain't a real holdup.
Does Jeff Butler know that?
What if he don't?
Is there any reason why you wouldn't
plug that yellow-livered skunk?
Jeff and I aren't partners in this game.
I'd plug him...
as quick as he'd plug me.
But don't go calling him names.
You ought to call him a couple.
He's certainly got the whole
town giving you the horselaugh.
Yeah, he's...
two up on me right now.
Mollie seems to think so.
Are you looking for
something between the eyes?
After I lift that payroll...
nobody's gonna laugh.
Nobody but me.
So long, Art. Hello,
Jeff. Where are you from?
Laramie. What's there?
Nothing. Tomorrow it'll be a city.
They're packing up Cheyenne
now and loading it on the cars.
Will you have a cup of tea while
I'm patching Monahan's pants?
No, thanks. But I'll sit on your
front porch till the special gets in.
Special? Who's on it?
Old John Dough. Jeff,
it's never the payroll?
I could do a jig for joy.
I've sat on quieter front porches.
And you've spooned on them
with better company, no doubt.
Not better company.
I'll dust the blarney
off that and be thankful.
There's no blarney
between you and me, Mollie.
I often wonder if I'll ever have
any other front porch than this.
Someday you'll have your
house anchored under you.
I don't know.
I've never lived without wheels under
me head when I lay me down to sleep.
You'll be darning socks for
some happy man before long.
I hope his heart won't
be far from the rails.
And where do you think you'll
spend your declining years?
I probably won't have
any declining years.
Don't say such a thing.
You change the night to fear
and the wind from warm to cold.
Feel my hand, 'tis ice.
In my job, Mollie...
a man can't look very far ahead.
Maybe when the road's done, I...
What do you mean, the wind's cold?
There isn't any wind.
'Tis no ordinary wind. 'Tis
the kind that witches ride on.
It blows trouble.
If you'll are making any promises
dealing with the future...
you're taking a lot for granted.
What's up?
Well, sir, it might be a sewing
bee, and it might be a hayride...
but there's eight of Sid Campeau's top
gunfighters missing from the Big Tent.
Is Dick with them? I reckon
he is. He ain't there.
Hey, Jeff! Yeah.
Eight horses, they're
gone from Campeau's corral.
Could you pick up their trail? The
Mexican boy said they ride east.
Maybe the Injuns is
giving an ice-cream social.
Pay train. That's what I figured.
Mollie, run for the telegraph office.
Tell Calvin to stop the
pay train at Pine Bluff.
Leach, get an engine and
a flatcar. I sure will.
Put our horses on the flatcar
and round up a few men.
You bet yourself. We
have good time tonight.
Oh, dear.
Pay train went through
Pine Bluff 10 minutes ago...
gathering speed for
the Pole Creek Divide.
Calvin, get that chief dispatcher
over here. Take the key, Mollie.
Try Egbert Siding. Oh, no.
It is closed after 6:00.
Maybe Joe's playing solitaire.
Try anyway and keep trying.
I'll see you later.
The saints ride with you, Jeff.
Let her go, Clancey!
Let the silver lay. It's too
heavy. Not for me, it ain't.
There's the headlights.
Slow her down.
Train coming from the West!
All right, boys. Let's get out of here.
Whoa.
Split up! Every man for himself.
Each of you, pick a man.
We got good fun, eh?
That all depends. Yeah.
What in the name of...
Tell Campeau to send a couple
of men over to this car. Run!
Gee, sure.
Why do you throw mail
through the window?
Hide that or you'll have a
killing on your front porch.
What's happening?
Quick. Well...
Hiya, Jeff. Where's the fire?
Man ride by here just now? Yeah.
You can still see his dust.
You can get him with a little...
hard riding.
Thanks.
You been here long?
Just waiting for a cup of
tea and a kiss from Mollie.
I'll join you.
For the tea.
Come in. Come in.
Hello, Mollie.
So it's the pair of you.
Can we give this bucko
some tea? Sure, sure. But...
Did you get to the
pay train in time? No.
Well, what happened?
Who broke your window? Oh, I...
Monahan must be back.
No, some gandy dancer feeling his
liquor was throwing a bottle at the moon.
What'd you do with it?
Do with what? The bottle.
Sure, now, I think
you're both a bit cracked.
Much of a crowd at the
Big Tent tonight, Dick?
I don't know. I was
out at the End of Track.
The dirt at the End of
Track is white gypsum.
You've got the same dust
on your boots I have.
It's red. Like a rose, huh?
More like the ground where
the pay train was held up.
Now, don't tell me they
got away with the payroll.
You should have asked that
fellow that rode by here.
Well, say, that's mighty
serious for the railroad.
Where were you, Jeff?
Now drink your tea, and
you'll both be feeling easier.
How much did they get? A mail sack full.
A mail sack?
Will you drink your tea and stop
staring like there was bullets in it.
Well, out here, Mollie, you never can
tell where you're gonna find a bullet.
That's right. A man
can't even trust a friend.
Hello.
There's no letters for you, I'm
not boiling tea for the house...
and we don't want to
make up a male quartet.
Captain Butler's a little
upset over a pay train holdup.
Too bad, bucko. Somebody
put one over on you?
Maybe.
You've had your refreshment, Jeff,
and now you'll want to be traveling...
after the robbers.
Sounds like good advice.
Maybe.
Lost something? No.
I just thought I might find the
bottle that broke that window.
You know, there's a
fellow named Pullman...
that just invented a new kind
of bunk that folds up like this.
Curiosity
killed a cat once, Jeff.
You'd better say good night.
Why? You leaving? No.
But you are. This is Mollie's
place, and she told you to get out.
Hold your yelps, all of you.
Never in me whole life have I
seen two such outrageous fortunes.
Sit down, Jeff, and look
what's in store for you.
The little leaves, all
crooked and helter-skelter.
Now, they tell you of life
and love and hope and grieving.
Will the tea leaves tell me
everything that's in this car, Mollie?
No.
No, they...
They're warning you to get moving...
or you'll be taking the long
journey on a one-way ticket.
What do you see in mine?
A girl with Irish eyes?
About your size?
No, I see two horns and a pointed tail.
I feel that cold witches' wind, Mollie.
How about some wood on the fire?
Don't let your hand slip, bucko.
That's your second mistake, Dick.
What was the first? Sending for help.
What are you waiting for,
Dick? Let him have it.
Dick, wait.
Will you...
Will you look at this now?
This circle in your cup here.
Does it look like a noose? No.
It looks like a ring.
A wedding ring? Well,
now, maybe it does...
but let's not be talking about
it until after Jeff is gone.
Does it look like this one, that was made
for the third finger of your left hand?
Why...
If this prying troubleshooter
ever gets out of me house...
I'll tell you, it's... It's yes.
Mollie.
Dick's been with me all evening
waiting to plight me his troth.
Dick's been with you? Yes.
Now, will you please go home?
Or are you waiting to
see it sealed with a kiss?
Did you hear that, bucko? Yes.
I heard it.
I'll be on me oath there's
no money here but $6.70...
in the cash drawer, and I'm
keeping Monahan's savings...
sewn up in the mattress.
Will you swear to that by
the little cross you wear?
Yes, I...
I must have lost it.
But I swear by what's
dear on this earth...
and by all the love that's in me...
and...
Please go, Jeff, there's
nothing in this car you want.
I guess that's right.
Mollie, my darling, you were glorious.
Me heart's still
jigging on me back teeth.
Where'd you hide it? Me heart?
No, I know where that
is. I mean the pay sack.
The pay sack?
Now what would I be
doing with a pay sack?
Quit the blarney and turn it
over while you're still able.
Threaten a Monahan, would you? If
I knew, I wouldn't be telling you!
Don't hurt him, Mollie.
All right now, clear
out, the both of you.
Tell Campeau I'll be there pronto.
Maybe I'd better stay
and help you with it.
I carried it quite a
way without your help.
Out.
First it's me heart,
and now it's me knees.
Where does Monahan keep his
Rule G? On top of the shelf.
How long will it take you to pack?
Why did you do it, Dick?
We've a lifetime together
to talk about that.
Suppose we find out first...
if they've got lakes in
Ireland the color of your eyes?
Take off your sweet lip
and say what you're meaning.
Or if you'd rather stay in America...
there's New York, St.
Louis, San Francisco.
And there's General Casement's
car across the tracks.
What do you mean? Back it
goes. Every penny of it.
I'll not be helping you rob the railroad
that's been mother and son to me.
You're crazy, Mollie.
Do you know what there is in that sack?
Champagne and carriages
and pretty dresses...
and a good time for
the rest of our lives.
There's nearly $200,000 in cash.
Use your wits, man.
Do you think you could
travel one mile with it now?
Jeff Butler suspicions you. The
whole railroad will be after you.
The only chance of saving your
neck is to return it yourself.
Me? You.
Or you'll be dancing with your feet off
the ground, and that's not a pretty sight.
Not for a bride on her wedding day.
I love you, Mollie.
I believe you do.
But there'll be no talk of a
wedding till you've done as I say.
It's the first time I've ever
discarded aces for a queen.
Where's the money? You're sitting on it.
Nobody knew the money was on that
train but you, Casement, and myself.
And Campeau.
How did he find out? I don't know.
Campeau's partner is a close
friend of yours, isn't he?
He was.
I want that payroll, Butler.
Or I want your resignation.
Good evening, gentlemen.
'Tis sorry I am to be interrupting
you, General, but this belongs to you.
To me? What is it? The payroll.
The payroll? The payroll? What?
Where'd you get it?
'Twas like this, I was...
Wait. How did you know it was
the payroll? By the bullet holes.
I wasn't shooting as badly as I thought.
Sure, that explains it.
The poor bandit running for shelter,
dropping the bag from weakness...
with your bullets in his back. The
bullets didn't go through the bag.
Where did you find it? Well, Mr.
Allen and I were taking a walk...
there's such a beautiful moon
tonight... Never mind the moon.
How long have you
been with Miss Monahan?
Not long enough.
Watch your talk, Allen. We intend
to hang the man who did this job.
No fooling.
Mollie, how did you come by this?
Well, now, I'll not remember a thing...
if you all keep charging at
me like a bull at red flannels.
Go on.
Well, we were taking some tea
over to Grandpa O'Shaughnessy...
Grandpa O'Shaughnessy
has drunk nothing...
but straight whiskey
since the war of 1812.
Well, except when he's got
the misery in his back...
and then he puts one part of
tea to seven parts of whiskey.
Miss Monahan, are you telling
the truth? Well, not quite.
As a matter of fact, we were on our way to
Father Ryan's to talk about getting married.
Getting married? You two?
Yeah, show him your ring, Mollie.
I'm waiting to hear
where you found the money.
On the tracks near Mollie's car.
How near? As near as
you might throw a stone.
Or a bottle? Well, anyway,
we brought it right here...
didn't we? Yes.
Before we even talked to
Father Ryan about our wedding...
in the morning.
Yes. Mollie, it's a medal
you deserve for this...
as well as congratulations.
I agree with General Casement, but
the wedding will have to be tonight.
But there's no great
hurry. Sure, there is.
We're moving up to Laramie...
and Father Ryan's church will
be on a flatcar in two hours.
You gonna be best man, bucko?
Captain Butler has work to do.
I want the man who
robbed that train, Butler.
Yes, sir.
I hope you deserve her, Dick.
We're all very grateful
to you, Miss Monahan.
Now, Mollie, what can we do for you?
I'll tell you
what we can do for her.
We'll give her a wedding tonight
that'll go down in history.
I wouldn't want to be
putting you to that trouble.
We could wait until...
Trouble?
I'll drive you to the church myself.
That's little enough.
Why, she saved our bacon.
Mollie, you've saved the railroad.
The church goes
on the next train, George.
Hey, lend us your hammer.
The board house comes now.
All right,
Donovan. Come on, O'Toole.
Don't take all week.
McGukkin's a
sound sleeper, ain't he?
Hot or cold, he goes.
Murder alive! If you wanted to come in,
why in blazes didn't you knock at the door?
Leave hold of it, Mike.
Everything goes to Laramie.
And where is Laramie? It's
wherever we set down this town.
All right, boys, come on, we'll
take the block. The roof comes next.
All right, Sullivan.
Come on, take the block.
# The fireman rang the bell #
# Oh, Lulu in a pink kimono says #

Where's Jeff Butler

Wherever they're
going, they mean business.

Hello, Campeau.
I hear you're moving to Laramie.
What about it?
Go on over in the corner and turn
your back and keep your hands up.
Come on back. You've got visitors.
One
yelp and you'll get the ax!
Get over here!
That's what
claps me ax through skull.
Don't you reach for your gun.
Who do you
think you're shoving?
Get those Irish
clodhoppers out of my place.
They just came down to help you move.
Fiesta, take Mr. Campeau in there.
Please.  Get one for me, Jeff.
Leach, watch the door.
Come on, boys. Free
drinks for everybody.
Nobody ain't drinking, Jake.
Ain't you heard the
Irish is teetotalers?
It's the first time I've heard about it.
Who held up that train, Campeau?
How should I know?
What'd he say, Fiesta?
He say, pretty soon he
will tell you all about it.
Pretty soon.
There were eight horses missing
from your corral. Where'd they go?
I don't know. Somebody
must have borrowed them.
Did you hear that, Fiesta?
Sure. You bet yourself.
Sure, I hear.
He say he think he knows
who take those horse.
Who rode those horses? I don't know.
I ain't left the tent tonight.
Look here, Butler.
You and your railroad
cutthroat can't bully me.
He called you a cutthroat, Fiesta.
He knows me pretty well.
Who led those men?
Butler, you're nailing
the lid on your own coffin.
Dick nailed the lid on yours
tonight. I ain't seen Dick.
Then you didn't know he turned
the money back to the railroad.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He sold you out to
the railroad, Campeau.
That's what you get for
picking a man in love.
You're lying. He turned the
payroll over to Casement.
I saw Dick give that girl a ring,
and she promised to marry him.
Looks like you're the
sucker this time, Campeau.
Now you talk.
All right, all right. What's
it to me? I wasn't there.
Sure. Dick stuck up the train.
What am I supposed to
do about it? Nothing.
Just come with me. You, too.
I'm going.
I declare, it won't seem natural
in Laramie without you boys.
Don't reach for your
handkerchief, Brett.
Just use your sleeve if
you want to wipe your mouth.
Leach, the mule's ready? Yeah.
You and Fiesta take all the dealers
outside and get them started.
Yeah.
And here. Don't forget this rat.
Sure, we have big fun with him.
For every crack of that
half-breed's whip...
I'll put a bullet through
that pig's hide of yours.
Come out from
under the table, you.
Dusky Clayton, it's all yours.
Take your hands off me.
Spit on your hands, you
terriers, and smash into it.
Yeah! Yeah!
I hope Dick don't get you, Butler.
I don't want nobody to get you but me.
There's a train east
tonight, Campeau. Be on it.
You're seen out here again,
you'll be shot on sight.
Now, dust!
Come on, Jeff, get into the shindy.
Haven't time. I'm going to a wedding.
All right, boys, put them back.
Cut it out!
Now you boys has got your options
of getting out in 30 seconds...
or being buried in 30 minutes.
Why, I can't ride this way.
It's a mite on handy, but the Indians
can't sneak up on you from behind.
Hey, you can't do this to us.
Well, come on, mule.
Hang the mule. I'm leaving.
And I plight unto thee my troth.
And I plight unto thee my troth.
Allow me to wish
you every happiness, Mrs. Allen.
Thank you, Father.
Congratulations. Thank you, sir.
##
Dick. Why, hello, Jeff.
Come to kiss the bride?
No, Dick. I've come for you.
You've got guns, I haven't.
That's your hard luck.
Have you found proof,
Butler? Yes, Campeau talked.
'Tis a terrible thing
you're doing, Jeff.
And for what? They've
got the money back.
The soldier that was guarding it
hasn't got his life back, Mollie.
Killing?
Dick would have been safe away
but for me. I got him into this.
Come with me, Mollie. No.
The railroad gives short shrift
to a train robber, Mrs. Allen.
Come on, Dick.
'Tis a brief honeymoon
you're giving the bride.
There's no other way, Mollie.
Can I kiss my husband goodbye?
All right.
Could you know the
heart-scald that's inside me...
there's much you'd understand, but I...
I know the railroad law and I...
The window, Dick! Run for it!
Don't shoot. Don't
shoot into that crowd.
What did he do?
He robbed the pay train.
What's the ruckus? Dick Allen. Got away.
Well, I declare.
Leach, get a couple of
horses.  No, Jeff.
You go on to Laramie.
They'll be needing you there.
Leach and Fiesta will stay here
and give Allen his medicine.
It might be better that way, I reckon.
Maybe.
When you reach Laramie,
pack your things...
and turn your car over
to the superintendent.
Your service with the
railroad is finished.
##
Lot of warm winter overcoats
on the hoof out there.
I hope the hogger don't hit one of them.
My apologies, Mrs. Allen.
Disgraceful hour for a
bridegroom to be coming home.
I'll wash off some of Wyoming
before I kiss you good morning.
A fine wedding night.
Under a car with a floor
between me and my wife.
You're not gonna give me
lead for breakfast, are you?
You shouldn't be on this
train. Jeff Butler's aboard.
Jeff? Back in the caboose.
'Tis an awful chance
you're taking, being here.
You're here, aren't you?
I'm not sure where I am.
Now, don't look so glum.
Here I am, all washed and beautiful
and wanting a most important kiss.
I loved you before, Mollie.
But after last night... Dick,
I must tell you straight out.
I don't feel for you what a woman
should for the man she's just married.
The cards are dealt, Mollie.
I'm the husband you
found in a teacup. I know.
Till death do us apart, but...
All I'm asking for is
a little time to... Time?
I'm borrowing it from the devil.
Why should I wait? You're
asking me and I'll tell you.
Do you know why I married you so quick?
Yes.
To stop Brett from putting
a bullet in Jeff's back.
You married me knowing that?
I love you enough to take
you any way I can get you.
Listen to me, Dick. I...
I've loved Jeff ever since I clouted
his face on the Omaha train...
but I'm married to you and
I'll stay that way, but...
Don't start out by making me hate you.
You won't hate me, Mollie.
You'll love me.
Gorry. What's hit us?
Keep down. It's a big war party.
What are they, Jeff?
Sioux, and a lot of them.
The saints forgive me for taking
human life. The red devils.
Are you all right? I
don't know. I think so.
Now's our chance. Once we're clear
of the train they won't get us.
I'm going to find Mollie. It's
too late to do her any good.
Maybe.
Come on, you fool, before they see us.
I hope you make it.
No, don't shoot.
You'll lead them right to us.
What do you think
happened to the caboose?
I hope he's okay.
Jeff!
Glory be.
Well, I'll be...
Hello, bucko. Me prayers were answered.
I guess we're the only ones alive.
How much ammunition you
got? A few for the pistol.
About 16 for the carbine.
Any chance of getting help?
If we could telegraph Cheyenne.
Wires cut? No.
But we've got nothing to send with.
Mr. Calvin showed me how
to send without any key.
How? Manna from heaven.
The wires across the window.
Cut one and give me your gun.
When I break it, pull the other
end down through the smashed roof.
Through your private entrance?
Now where's me poker?
All right, try it.
What'll I say? Cheyenne.
Is there anyone left
there? Leach and Fiesta.
They're looking for you.
What are you chuckling at, Mr. Calvin?
Some operator feeling his liquor, Alida.
When a man's on his trick
he ought not to... Wait.
Get Leach and Monahan. They're outside.
Indians wrecked Number
It's Mollie calling for help!
Mr. Monahan! Mr. Overmile!
Mr. Monahan! Mr. Overmile!
It's near an hour and I'm thinking
our message didn't get through.
Sure it got through.
They had to get soldiers
from Fort Russell.
Do you hear it? Help's coming!
Some buck's pounding the
bell of the dead engine.
Here's a bite so we'll not
be dying on an empty stomach.
Jeff.
They're working down this way.
What do you think?
We'll try again, Mollie.
Keep sending.
We'll have no chance after they see us.
What do you say we...
That does it.
Take this gun, Mollie.
Let them have it, Dick.
Something like old times, huh?
Yeah, only you didn't have a wife
with you then. Make a barricade.
Faster, faster!
Feed him more wood. You're starving him.
Hope your old kettle don't blow up.
Why don't you get out and push?
Mollie's all right, Monahan.
Jeff's on that train.
This engine she...
she never gets full.
##
Why do you keep me loading when
there's shooting to be done?
Because you wasted a shot on
that cigar store Indian out there.
Yeah, what did you have against him?
You're just joking to
keep me spirits up...
because you know Cheyenne
never got our message.
Sure they got it.
I'm no surer than you are.
Jeff, behind you!
Hey, look up there.
Trestle over Dale Creek's afire, Leach!
Keep going,
Monahan, we're all right!
If we're gonna burn after we're
dead, let's get some practice.
Here we go.
Dale Creek Bridge afire, Major!
Got your asbestos pants on?
Let her go!
Lie down men, and cover your heads!
Flat on your face or
your wives won't know you.
Smoked herring!
Hey, my coat's on fire!
Well, take it off! Take it off!
Get it off!
This is nothing.
You know, I got a wife in Yuma.
She...
My mustache.
My mustache, she is gone. My mustache!
I declare I
never liked it no way.
There's one in there and none for that.
How many have you got?
Three.
Just enough to go around.
You won't let them take
me alive, will you, Jeff?
No.
Maybe you'd better do
the honors all around...
before they find we're
out of ammunition.
Give me mine while I'm not looking.
That's the last of mine.
I'll say a bit of a
prayer for the three of us.
##
##
Did you hear it?
What? The whistle.
Jeff! Dick!
Didn't you hear it?
Or am I so close to the other
shore I'm hearing things?
Go on with your prayer, Mollie.
Mollie, darling.
There! Can't you hear it?
It's Monahan's old
engine. It's McPherson.
I know the shrill voice of him.
You hear it, Jeff? Yeah.
Come on, Monahan. Good old Monahan.
It's his old iron horse. I know
his bray from here to Omaha.
Oh, Jeff!
Forward!
Charge!
They got them on the run.
Dick! Not all of them!
By gorry, they're rushing the car.
Scat!
Clear out of here!
Scat!
Mollie.
Mollie, darling.
She's badly hurt, Jeff.
I'll get her to the army doctor.
No, you can't, with that arm.
I'll carry her. No, you won't.
Get up to Skull Rocks. I'll
bring you word there tonight.
No, I'm not going to leave her.
She's mine. She's my wife.
When Leach and the soldiers come
back here, you'll be a dead man.
You're still wanted, Dick.
Mollie, my darling.
Hello, bucko. Hello, Dick.
How is she?
Doctor says she'll
come through all right.
My thanks to the Big Dealer.
I'm afraid it's going to be
a long pull for her, though.
And you won't let me see her?
Dick...
you and I have fought
side by side many times.
We've been through
hell and high water...
robbed the same chicken
coop, chewed on the same bone.
But you're on the other
side in this fight...
and the next time I see you on Union
Pacific property, I'll have to...
You got a match?
Won't your conscience
bother you for letting me go?
There's grub and blankets
in the pack on that horse.
I won't be hung for
horse stealing, will I?
Belonged to an Indian.
He won't need it anymore.
All right.
All right. I'll get going.
Where to?
Central Pacific.
You're going to help the
road that's trying to beat us?
Yeah.
I'm gonna help them the same
way I helped the Union Pacific.
Here. You might need that.
Don't deal any cards off
the bottom with it. Thanks.
Extra cartridges in the pack. Thanks.
You're all aces, bucko.
But you're in love with Mollie...
and don't you ever forget she's my wife.
I might. She wouldn't.
Now, when the Central meets the
Union's tracks, I'll be there, Jeff...
and you and the Union Pacific
and the devil himself...
won't keep me from my wife.
I'd hate to kill you with your own gun.
I'll be there, Dick.
Oh, Jeff...
you're wasting your time on Campeau.
The man behind him is
Barrows, the banker.
Thanks.
So long, Dick. So long, bucko.
Thirty days? Thundering
Hades! We can't lose one day.
The ground in that tunnel is frozen
harder than rock. We can't dig through!
We've got to blast
every inch for 900 feet.
Stuck here for 30 days?
And Ogden only 60 miles away.
And the Central on the plains...
with nothing to stop them
but daisies and buttercups.
In the Army, when we can't smash
through the enemy's center...
we always go around the flanks.
What's that, Butler?
Lay a track on the snow.
What? On the snow?
On the snow? No one
ever laid track on snow.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Go ahead, Butler. I'll
show you what I mean.
Go around the mountain
instead of through it.
Then finish your tunnel
later. Impossible.
Impossible?
It was impossible to lay
four miles of track a day...
impossible to clear out the gamblers...
impossible to make
engines climb mountains.
Jumping Beelzebub! It was impossible
for Moses to cross the Red Sea.
Why can't we lay track on top of snow?
Well, let's find out.
You never seen the like.
A track laid on 10 feet of snow.
We have the race as good as won.
Come here before you hang yourself.
That Jeff Butler...
don't wear all his
brains in his holster.
Who's going to take
the first train over?
Now, who else would they be trusting
to it but me and old McPherson.
It is a chancy thing, so
don't go breaking your neck.
Well, 'tis the first time for
an engine to run on snow...
and if he don't like it,
I'll put snowshoes on him.
Here, open your mouth and
take what's good for you.
Tastes like it come out
of McPherson's boiler.
The highest and longest
railroad in the whole world...
had just come out of McPherson's boiler.
So don't you be insulting him.
Here...
take this along in case you...
Let me kiss you to keep you warm.
Looks like you won't need to put
those snowshoes on him, Monahan.
Well, he's been through fire and snow...
and if he comes to a
river, he'll swim it.
They're going to make it. Sure they are.
Jump, Monahan! Jump!
There she goes! Look out, Monahan!
They're both gone!
Poor old Monahan.
I know you're hurting me...
no more than you can help.
Monahan!
Monahan! Praise Heaven, you're alive.
I fell clear. We'll get you out.
It's no use, Jeff.
Me and him has come to End of Track.
Oh, no.
Now. Oh, no, it's no use.
You'll have to beat the Central...
to Ogden without us...
if you can.
That'll be hard without you.
Mollie's cross.
Bury us both together, Jeff.
Here where we can hear
the trains thundering by.
There's nothing like
hearing an engine whistle...
in the still night.
What's to be done now?
Start shoring up that track, Dusky.
And what will happen
to the railroad now?
As soon as the track's
shored up, we'll try again...
with another train.
Hook this car on it, will you?
There's only one thing wrong
about dying in the snow, Jefferson.
A fella's liable to catch cold!
Here she comes! Tighten up!
Good boy, Jeff! The
Central can't beat us now.
He's over! They've made it!
I told
you they could do it!
You passed the 1000 Mile
Tree back there, General.
We're gonna beat them, Jeff.
We lay six miles of track
today, seven tomorrow...
Then wire your congratulations
to the Central Pacific.
Why? What's wrong?
That parlor engineer that Asa M. Barrows
brought with him just condemned...
What? Condemned 27 miles?
Why, that'll let the Central
into Ogden ahead of us.
Barrows, huh?
Boy...
Get me Leach Overmile
and Fiesta. Yes, sir.
You lay the track into
Ogden, General Casement...
I'll handle Mr. Barrows.
You'll regret this.
You'll regret this as long as you...
Don't you worry none
about us, Mr. Barrows.
You just think about yourself. Here.
This is plain abduction.
Do you hear that, Fiesta?
Abduction.
That is why I had to
marry my first wife.
How much do you want?
We don't want nothing. We're just interested
in the Union Pacific, same as you are.
Here, put that on.
Now, about this track you
say won't pass inspection.
What about it?
You and us are going to walk over
every inch of that 27 mile of track...
and then you're going to show
us every place that needs fixing.
What?
And then you're going to fix it.
Walk over 27 miles of track.
Here's your cane, Mr.
Barrows. Time's a-wasting.
##
Here's another one, right there.
Seems to me like I've found more
the matter with this track...
than you have, Mr. Barrows.
He will ruin the railroad.
You're all mixed up, Mr. Barrows.
You're trying to drive the
tie through the spike...
instead of the spike through the tie.
##
I do declare, he's improving.
General Casement. Yeah?
At this very moment, the
Union Pacific's first train...
is pulling into Ogden, Utah.
The victor in the great
race to girdle the continent.
Say, does the New York Tribune
own this telegraph line?
We're about to turn it
over to the Boston Post.
Gentlemen...
President Grant has chosen
Promontory Point, west of Ogden...
as the place where the two Pacific
railroads shall meet and join their rails.
Promontory Point? Where is that?
And so President Grant has chosen
Promontory Point as the meeting place...
for the two railroads.
Jeff.
I've not seen you in a month of Sundays.
Sit yourself down.
I just came over to say goodbye before
you get lost in the crowd out there.
Everybody's coming to
see the engines meet.
You know...
California sent a golden
spike to clinch the last rail.
But when they drive it...
it will mean the end of everything.
Not for you.
Dick'll be out there...
waiting to take you to a
home that's not on wheels.
And no engines whistling
to put me to sleep.
And where will your
restless boots be taking you?
Texas.
They're starting
another road down there.
Dodge asked me to go as an engineer.
It's the coming true of your dream.
I am glad for you.
Sure...
sure there'll be some girl
to throw you sheep's eyes...
and boil the tea when
you call for your mail.
Mollie. 'Tis just the excitement...
of joining the rails and all.
Remember me to yourself
sometimes when you're...
when you're riding the handcars with
some of them beautiful Texas women.
It's you I'll always want.
Some of your sweetness
got into my blood.
I guess it's there for life.
And my heart will be answering you...
as long as ever it beats.
And now you'll be merciful if you'd take
yourself out of here as quick as you can.
Goodbye, Mollie.
##
Laurel wood, eh?
Ain't no hard feelings
on our part, Mr. Barrows.
I'd put you in jail but for
one thing. You like us, eh?
I hate the sight of you.
You've cost me millions.
But you've cured my indigestion.
How come you
ain't out to the big jamboree?
I got something else to do.
...and that this mighty
enterprise maybe unto us...
as the Atlantic of thy strength...
and the Pacific of thy love. Amen.
I'll bet that all them that lies
under the sod between here and Omaha...
would love to see this sight.
They're laying golden rails in Heaven.
And Monahan's giving the angels
a free ride on old McPherson.
He is that.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Dr. Harkness of California.
Ladies and gentlemen...
the last rail needed to complete...
the greatest railroad
enterprise of the world...
has just been laid.
And the last spike...
needed to unite the
Atlantic and the Pacific...
is about to be driven.
To perform these acts...
the East and the West...
have come together.
Never since history commenced
her record of human events...
has man been called upon...
to meet the completion of a work
so magnificent in contemplation...
and so marvelous in execution.
California, within whose borders...
and by whose citizens the Pacific
Railroad was inaugurated...
desires to express her appreciation...
of the vast importance...
to her and
her sister states...
of the great enterprise,
which by your joint action...
is about to be consummated.
From her mines of gold...
she has forged a spike.
From her laurel woods...
she has hewn a tie.
And by the hands of her citizens...
she offers them to become a
part of the great highway...
which is about to unite
her in closer fellowship...
with her sisters of the Atlantic.
From her bosom was taken the first soil.
Let hers be the last
tie and the last spike.
May God confirm the
unity of our country...
as this railroad unites the
two great oceans of the world.
The honorable Leland Stanford...
Governor of California...
and President of the Central Pacific...
will strike the first
blow at the golden spike.
##
Mama, he missed it.
We'll take the will
for the deed, Governor.
The next blow will be struck
by Vice President Durant...
of the Union Pacific.
By doggies, looks to me like this
railroad ain't never going to be finished.
I now call upon the man...
whose financial aid came to
us in a time of great need.
Mr. Asa M. Barrows.
I didn't think he could do it.
Maybe we go drink our health now. Yep.
The hand is quicker than the eye.
Now stop your flapdoodle
and watch... Miss Mollie...
I can't find Mr. Jeff nowheres...
to tell him Campeau's in
town looking for to shoot him.
Don't worry.
Jeff'll make that tinhorn look
like... But he's not wearing his guns.
Well, that's different.
Use this for an anchor till I get back.
Attention, please!
Before the engines come together...
will everyone please take positions...
for a photograph.
I thought you was Butler,
but you had it coming anyway.
Dick. Dick!
Watch yourself.
Campeau.
I'll get you to a doctor
first. No. No use, Jeff.
I've drawn the black deuce.
Bend closer. Mollie...
I'm just a...
I'm just a busted flush.
It's your deal, Jeff.
Yes, sir.
The very next day she trotted
a mile in two minutes flat.
Thank you!
And so this great nation is united...
with a wedding ring of iron.
Mr. Bradford!
Mr. Booth!
The saints be praised, you're safe.
Where's Dick?
He'll be waiting for us, Mollie...
at the End of Track.
