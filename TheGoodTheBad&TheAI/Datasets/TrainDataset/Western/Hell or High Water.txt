-
- TANNER: Quiet.
Open the door,
open the door.
What?
What in the devil?
TOBY: Can you please stand up
and take us to the cash drawer, ma'am?
- I will not.
- TANNER: We ain't asking.
There's no money
in the drawers yet.
It's in the safe
and I ain't got the code.
TANNER:
Prove it.
Drawer!
ELSIE:
Here.
TANNER:
Open the drawer.
- I need the keys.
- Keys.
Step back.
Shit. Damn it!
Y'all are new at this,
I'm guessing.
- Where's the money?
- I told you, it's in the safe.
- Well, who has the code?
- Mr. Clauson.
He'll be here soon
and I suggest you fellers don't be.
All you're guilty of right now
is being stupid.
Just leave and that's all it'll be.
Tell me I'm stupid again.
What time does Mr. Clauson get here?
Ma'am, look at me.
What time does
Mr. Clauson get here, huh?
TANNER:
We're walking.
And sit.
Where do you think you're going?
Sit on the floor!
-
-
You're stupid.
TANNER:
This ain't about you, darling.
Elsie, you all right?
- Good morning.
-
TOBY:
You didn't have to hit him.
Whoo!
- Slow down.
- I ain't speeding.
See, little brother,
not a worry in the world.
Planning this and doing it
is two different things.
Maybe we should get there ahead,
get up to Olney.
Early bird gets the worm.
- TOBY: Slow down.
- TANNER: I ain't speeding.
I found these coins
in the barn.
Lord knows how long
they've been sitting there.
I've been living off an inmate's diet,
and had all these coins
sitting right underneath
a bunch of feed sacks.
- This one says 1953.
- 1953?
I wonder if any of these
is collector's items.
You could be sitting
on a fortune here.
I hope so.
TANNER: Good morning, folks.
Open the drawer!
Open the motherfucking drawer!
TOBY: Ones, fives, 10s, 20s,
no hundreds, no bundles.
- You boys robbing the bank?
- TANNER: Shut up.
Put your hands on the counter.
On the counter.
- Yes, sir.
- That's it, come on.
That's crazy.
Y'all ain't even Mexicans.
TANNER: Uh-uh, uh-uh.
No bundles.
Just loose cash.
Okay.
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.
Hands on the counter
where I can see them!
Yes, sir.
You got a gun on you, old man?
You're damn right
I got a gun on me.
- Are you gonna get his gun?
- Yeah.
TANNER: Keep up
with the circumstances, okay?
- TOBY: Yeah, I got it.
- So are y'all gonna steal my gun, too?
TANNER:
I have my own gun.
We ain't stealing from you.
We're stealing from the bank.
-
- TANNER: Much obliged.
Let's go!
TOBY:
Sorry about this, folks.
Dirty, rotten sons of bitches.
TANNER:
Fuck you, old man!
-
- TOBY: Go, run, go!
Put the gun on the counter?
You trying to get us killed?
I ain't stealing
from some old man.
We're stealing
from one place, that's it.
You're turning out to be
a poor-ass criminal.
Oh, fuck you.
Whoo!
See what the early bird gets?
Maybe we should hit
that branch in Jayton?
No, we ain't.
We hit those banks
first thing in the fucking morning,
when they're empty.
- When they're empty, God damn it!
- All right.
It's the last time
I care to be shot at.
We got to be smart.
We're a ways from being finished.
Shit, I can do this all week.
We're gonna.
We're like the Comanches,
little brother,
raiding wherever we please
with the whole of Texas
hunting our shadow.
Lord of the Plains.
-
-
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
- Hands off.
- Fuck off!
ALBERTO:
Why are you always
dressed like me?
This is our uniform.
We ain't got no uniform.
You can wear whatever
color shirt you choose.
You just keep choosing mine.
Ranger regs say white,
blue, or tan dress shirts.
Stands to reason every once in a while
we're gonna be dressed the same.
Well, you know what they say
about imitation, Alberto.
You wanna hear
about these bank robberies,
or you'll just sit there
and let Alzheimer's run its course?
Where are they at?
Texas Midlands...
the branch in Archer City
and the branch in Olney.
FBI want an assist?
Midlands ain't got
any branches outside Texas.
Plus, they're just hitting the drawers
for a few thousand.
FBI don't want it.
You may get to have some fun
before they send you off
to the rocking chair yet.
I need you sober.
Who the hell gets drunk
off a beer?
Place looks like shit.
You got anything else
you wanna say?
There's not a decent steak
in the whole lot
of them sorry sons of bitches.
Yeah, well, while you were busy in jail,
I was busy looking after Mama,
so you can go fuck yourself.
Was she in that bed awhile?
Three months.
The end there was pretty rough.
I could've helped out a little
if she asked.
I could've fed
them skinny cows.
We had nothing to feed them.
Well, I could've helped clean up
the house a bit.
Never took you for the go-to guy
for house cleaning.
No.
Just robbing banks.
You know.
Fuck her.
She never wanted nothing
to do with me anyway.
She leave a will?
Yeah.
Am I in it?
The will don't matter.
She left everything to me.
By Friday it all goes to my boys.
She didn't mean nothing by it.
She damn sure meant it.
She always hated me
for standing up to him.
TOBY:
You never understood that fighting back
makes the beating last longer.
No, I understood.
That's why I stopped fighting
and shot that son of a bitch.
Hey, what's going on?
Somebody robbed
the bank this morning.
Do what?
If you see anyone
looking a little sideways,
give me a call.
Sideways don't wanna meet me.
Find itself on the wrong end
of a short rope.
Oh, well, that would simplify things
for everyone but you.
Maybe,
if you can find the tree.
God, I love West Texas.
- Ranger.
- Hi there.
Wasn't much of a robbery.
Got off with just under $7,000.
Took the drawer money,
- No ink pack?
- Nope.
- Smart.
- That was smart.
Can we get a look
at the video?
Let me introduce you
to the bank manager, Mr. Clauson.
This here is Ranger Hamilton.
- Ranger.
- Sir.
Can we get a look
at the surveillance video?
We got cameras, but they're switching us
over to a digital system
that feeds into the computer.
These new cameras
don't hook to our VCRs.
Call over
the Young County Sheriffs.
Ask them if they thought
to hook their cameras
to some sort of
recording device.
- Armed?
- Yes, sir. Pistols.
Oh.
Faces covered?
Ski masks, sweatshirts,
baggy pants...
- Uh-huh.
- Like them thugs in Dallas.
Tweakers, maybe?
Maybe.
A little early in the morning
for tweakers.
Tweakers don't sleep.
They just tweak.
They rob drug stores
and parked cars, not banks.
Can I take a look inside?
Yes, sir.
ALBERTO:
Yeah, I'm here, Margaret.
So they bopped you
in the snozzola, huh?
Yes, sir.
Not very nice.
I know their faces was covered,
but could you tell their race?
Black, white?
Their skin or their souls?
Let's leave their souls
out of this for now.
White.
From around here somewhere
is my guess,
you know, from their voices.
Oh?
ALBERTO: Young County says
same deal with the branch in Olney.
Excuse me.
Do they have video?
Same deal all the way around.
Doesn't Walmart sell all sorts
of electronic equipment?
My word.
Get your hands off that.
Well, these boys, they aren't done yet,
I'll tell you that.
- How come?
- Well, they're patient.
They're just sticking to the drawers,
not taking the hundreds.
That's the bank's money.
We can trace that.
They're trying to raise
a certain amount.
That's my guess.
It's gonna take
a few banks to get there.
-
-
Your boys know how rich
they're gonna be?
They don't know anything yet.
You take them to the funeral?
Like I said,
they don't know anything.
When's the last time
you saw them?
When we all went to the rodeo
in Stamford right after you got out.
- That was a year ago.
- I talk to them on the phone.
You talk to them on the phone?
- You want a little advice?
- No. No, I don't.
Go see them tomorrow.
You got any idea how much
I owe Debbie in child support?
You've got enough in your front pocket
to fix that problem right now.
We can't spare it,
you know that.
Maybe we should hit
another branch.
You know, you talk like
we ain't gonna get away with this.
I've never met nobody who got away
with anything, ever.
You?
Then why in the hell
did you agree to do it?
Because you asked,
little brother.
I got to shit like an old goat.
Grab the check,
meet me out front.
JENNY ANN: Well, if that isn't a hint,
I don't know what is.
- You like your steak?
- Yes, ma'am.
Well, you've got
a ways to go yet.
Yeah, you'll be waiting around all day
for me to finish this.
I'll be here whether
you finish it or not, so...
you take your time.
Sure is quiet in here.
Open the drawer.
Fives, 10s, 20s.
Fan them out
like a deck of cards.
What do you do?
Last job was for a...
natural gas company.
Sounds high-dollar.
No, there ain't nothing
high-dollar about drilling.
No one seems to be
drilling for gas now, anyway.
They're sure drilling for oil.
I mean, ain't one drill
the same as the next?
- That's my take on it.
-
Guess I got to get
someone else to believe me.
-
- COOK:
We could use a cook.
Just a thought.
COOK:
Bye.
Start the car!
TOBY:
Shit!
Fuck! Shit!
- Go, go, go!
-
I bet you don't owe this much
in child support.
I must be out of my goddamn mind
to ask you for help.
You wanna get us killed?!
Huh?!
That's not a Midlands Branch.
That's not part of the plan.
Now, we got to go back to the ranch
and bury the car.
- Fuck!
- No, we do not.
We're over halfway to Oklahoma.
I'm not driving a stolen getaway car
to a fucking Indian casino.
You just put us
a goddamn day behind.
Well, I got us a day ahead this morning,
so I guess we're even.
- You're welcome.
- Fuck you.
Can't you answer
your own phone?
I'm driving. You're just sitting there
twiddling your fat fingers.
Ranger Hamilton's phone.
- It's reckless is what it is.
- Oh...
It's tweakers, I'm telling you.
I don't think these boys
is reckless.
Damn sure ain't tweakers.
They know exactly
what they're doing.
I don't know how you're gonna survive
without somebody to outsmart.
You need a hobby, and quick.
How about a horse?
Mary Beth was the rider.
A horse would only
remind me of her.
You like to fish.
Not enough to do it
every goddamn day.
Yeah, when I retire,
I'm gonna move Esme and me
down to Galveston.
Buy a fishing boat.
Gonna live on that son of a bitch
right at the pier.
Oh, who knows?
Maybe one of these bank robbers
is gonna want a gunfight
and I can dodge my retirement
in a blaze of glory.
Well, I've seen you shoot.
There won't be much glory in it.
Oh, well, I'm lucky
I got a half-breed by my side
to avenge me.
If you can stay sober
long enough,
knowing how you Injuns
like the bottle.
Whoa.
-
-
Hey!
What you all doing?
You burning this field?
Why in the shit
would we do that?
This kicked up on the highway,
been chasing us ever since.
Wish we could do
something for you.
Ought to just let it turn me to ashes,
put me out of my misery.
Cut that fence.
to the river with a herd of cattle.
And I wonder why my kids
won't do this shit for a living.
Move 'em out.
Come on.
Go, go, go.
You wanna call it in?
Oh, it's gonna burn out
when it hits the Brazos.
No one to call
around here, anyway.
No, these boys is on their own.
TANNER:
I still don't see the problem, Toby.
TOBY:
You still don't...
Well, the problem is,
thanks to you,
we have to spend tomorrow morning
getting another car,
so we'll have to hit two banks
on Wednesday.
TANNER:
We already done three today.
Stop worrying.
TOBY:
Whose land is this?
TANNER:
Jeremy Chalker.
He lets me stay here in exchange
for shooting coyotes.
Cold beer in the fridge.
You stole my hat.
I borrowed it.
What the fuck you do to it?
- What's this?
- My livelihood.
We don't need all this.
Can't keep the guns
in the trailer days on end.
That's not coming with us
in the bank.
VERNON PD OFFICER:
Just spoke to the teller.
She's a little shook up.
Perp took her driver's license,
threatened her family
if she talked to us.
MARCUS: Mind if I ask you
your name, young lady?
Natalie Martinez.
MARCUS: Well, Natalie,
I want you to know
we're gonna have some officers
watching your house extra careful
till we catch these buggers.
You have my word on that.
There's more than one?
Only one man robbed the bank?
- Yeah.
- What'd he look like?
He was dressed like a cowpoke
except for the ski mask.
I think he ran to a car
that was parked out front of the diner.
You saw the car?
It was green.
- How old?
- I don't know cars, mister.
Well, was it a nice car,
an okay car,
or a real piece of shit?
It was a real piece of shit.
All right.
Now, we're getting somewhere.
Oh, that looks like a man
who could foreclose on a house.
Excuse me, Natalie.
Excuse me, Mr. Banker.
Natalie, I'm gonna have the officer
stay with you till your father arrives.
- All right?
- Okay.
Didn't happen to have your surveillance
cameras on this morning, did you?
Of course.
Oh, so you have
the robbery on video.
Of course we do.
What kind of bank would we be
if we didn't have video surveillance?
Oh, you'd be
a Texas Midlands Bank.
All right, we've got video.
Care to give it a watch
while I wander over to the burger joint?
Would you order me something
while you're there?
- I'm starving.
- I doubt they serve pemmican.
You know
I'm part Mexican, too.
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna get to that
when I'm through
with the Indian insults,
but it's gonna be a while.
- You rangers are an odd bunch.
-
No, just him.
Let's take a look at that video.
Yeah, it's right back here.
WAITRESS:
Howdy.
Ma'am.
Guess you know about
the goings-on at the bank.
I did notice.
Any out-of-towners
come through today?
Jenny Ann waited on a couple of boys,
ain't from here.
Oh?
I'll go get her.
Appreciate that.
Boys.
Y'all been here for a while?
Well, long enough to watch
a bank getting robbed
that's been robbing me
for 30 years.
Oh, you say you've seen them?
I'm pretty sure they were sitting
right over there having lunch.
One of them was tall.
The other one was short.
They's both lean like cowboys.
Looked like brothers
if you ask me.
You the Texas Ranger?
Yes, ma'am.
Tell me about those handsome
young strangers that you waited on.
Who said handsome?
I did.
Based on the fact that you didn't
meet me in the parking lot,
hollering about
the two out-of-towners
eating here
right before a bank robbery.
Well, they didn't mention
they was robbing the bank.
They paid cash?
That a crime now?
How much did they leave?
How much?
$200.
And they left it before
the bank was robbed, so...
Uh, before this bank
was robbed.
I'm gonna need
to see them bills.
- Ma'am.
- Mm-mm.
Ma'am, them bills is evidence.
Mm-mm, it's evidence
if they're the bank robbers.
Till then, it's my tip.
And half my mortgage.
So, you go out there
and you get a warrant,
and you come after the money
that I will be using to keep a roof
over my daughter's head.
One man hit the bank,
just like she said.
- Yeah.
- Checkered button-down shirt,
jeans, ski mask.
- That's all the video will tell us.
- Yep. Yep.
Checkered shirt.
That is him.
They were sitting right over there.
Tipped her $200.
Go wrestle a description
from that big sassy girl
in the kitchen.
You didn't get it yourself?
Oh, and get that tip from her.
We're gonna check them bills.
Good luck.
Yeah, I'd expect some resistance.
Oh, and, Alberto,
call that motel on 287,
get us a room.
We're gonna stay the night?
Well, this is where the action is.
Seems foolish.
What's that?
The days of robbing banks
and trying to live to spend the money...
they're long gone.
Long gone for sure.
MAN:
What does Justin want to do
when he's grown?
Right now he's dreaming
of slinging a football for A&M.
Just because you asked me to
He's a lot like you.
- I bet that puckers your red eye.
- More than you know.
If he turn left where I turned right,
he'll be okay.
Just because you asked me to
Let the world call me a fool
Things are right with me and you
Yaw.
That's all that matters
and I'll do
- Yaw.
-
You want anything?
Dr Pepper, Winston Lights.
- It's okay. Come on.
-
What?
What, bitch?
You looking for trouble,
motherfucker?
You came to the right place.
Boy, you'd think
there were 10 of me.
Oh, yeah?
Not so fucking tough now,
are you, bitch?
-
-
THUG 2:
Hey, man, he had it coming.
He had it coming.
He had it coming.
You got some spunk
left in you.
Oh, you remembered the gun.
You're getting
to be old hat at this.
Asshole could've killed you.
Ah, not the way it would
have gone, little brother.
TANNER:
Are you trying to make me mad?
I said Dr Pepper.
This is Mr. Pibb.
TOBY:
That's all they had.
TANNER:
Only assholes drink Mr. Pibb.
TOBY:
Drink up.
Hello.
MAN: No!
Now we're talking.
The women in this place.
TOBY: What the hell
you talking about?
We should get another shot.
They'll be pretty soon enough.
Bartender,
whiskeys if you please.
BARTENDER:
Coming up.
To your boys.
Let's go change that money.
Sorry.
I just sold my car.
This is how the fella paid me.
We take it any way
you bring it, mister.
Wanna play some poker?
I don't gamble.
You can't lose at poker,
not even you.
I'm gonna watch the Aggie game
and have a beer.
All right, suit yourself.
- Come on, now.
-
Suck a D.
Don't lose it all.
TANNER:
Fucking asshole.
That's, uh...
that's quite a stack.
Check?
Don't chase me, chief.
You Comanche?
Lords of the Plains.
Lords of Nothing now.
I call.
Show your cards, gentlemen.
Do you know
what Comanche means?
It means enemies forever.
Enemies with who?
Everyone.
You know what that makes me?
An enemy.
No.
It makes me a Comanche.
Does he look like you?
I see his mom in him.
Everybody else sees me.
I don't know.
You staying in the hotel?
Yeah.
Take me to your room.
Thank you.
Just, uh...
There's no shame
in needing the touch of a woman.
You need it.
I know you do.
Just let me touch you.
Trying to work my little brother?
- No, I wasn't doing anything, but I...
- Tanner, she didn't do nothin'.
- She didn't do nothin'.
- But, but, but, but, but...
You saw there was
a stack of chips here.
- Don't.
- Easy mark?
- Uh... no.
- What were you gonna do?
Bring him up to his room,
call your pimp,
- roll him, drug him, what?
- No. I...
- What were you gonna do?
- Tanner, no.
Mind if I sample the goods?
Real fuckin'...
Hands off. Stop it.
Stop it.
- You're fucking crazy!
- Call me.
SECURITY GUARD:
- TOBY: It's all good.
- TANNER: It's all good.
It's all good.
Just got a little drunk at the bar.
Sorry about that.
How the fuck have you managed
to stay out of prison for a year?
It's been difficult.
Like to pay this out
in cash or check?
Get some Debbie money.
Four in cash, rest in check.
Who would you like
the check made out to?
Texas Midlands Bank.
Thank you much.
Let's go get a room.
-
-
Welcome to the Comanche 66.
Do you have a reservation?
TANNER:
We do not.
Good Lord, look at you.
We would be obliged if you
would provide accommodations,
though we failed to call ahead.
Boy, you are trouble.
I'm the worst kind, darling.
In your last days in the nursing home,
you'll think of me and giggle.
PREACHER:  Why, God?
Why won't you answer my prayers?
and yet you look around at your life
and nothing is different.
And so you assume
that God has told you no.
Why couldn't we drive back
to Lubbock?
'Cause they ain't robbing banks
in Lubbock.
We're not gonna watch this,
are we?
Ain't you Christian?
Yeah, but I ain't stupid.
God doesn't talk through this man
any more than he talks through my dog.
Well, then maybe you should
give your dog a listen.
Ain't you Indian?
You're supposed to be
burning sage
and dancing around the bed,
whooping like a bee stung you.
I'm Catholic.
Come on.
Come on, I'd rather dance
around the fire with a spear.
I'd rather have you stab me
with a spear than watch this.
This son of a bitch,
he wouldn't know God
if he crawled up his pant leg
and bit him on the pecker.
Change the damn channel.
Now, this, this is
what God watches right here.
Don't worry, they're gonna have
soccer highlights on soon enough.
That's for your Mexican half.
-
-
Ooh!
Wow, look at this boy run.
Longhorns are gonna have
a good team this year.
That soccer,
never could understand that.
Anything a 5-year-old can do
ain't a sport.
Who invented it? Aztecs?
Kickin' around skulls
or something, right?
Sounds like a Comanche sport.
You know, in three weeks,
you can watch whatever
you want on TV all day.
Hell, you can do it right now
in your own room.
Oh, where's the fun in that?
You know what, Alberto?
What?
In a year's time,
it's my teasing
that you're gonna miss.
It's what you'll laugh about
when you stand over my grave
and wish me well.
God, I hope that's tomorrow.
Oh, that was a good one.
You'll get the hang of this yet.
Isn't it getting late for you?
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
TANNER:
Oh, heavens above.
-
- Heavens above.
Look at those titties.
Are you fucking kidding me?
ALBERTO:
Sleeping on the porch,
practicing my future.
It's a dangerous thing
we do for a living.
You're lucky...
having seen it through
to the end.
I hope I'm that lucky.
Oh, well.
Without me by your side,
I doubt you'll get close enough
to a criminal to ever be
in danger again.
Just when I was starting
to feel sorry for you.
Indians ain't supposed
to feel sorry for cowboys.
It's the other way around.
And this makes you the executor?
BILLY:
So, no matter what they charge us with,
they can't take it away?
There's no way to trace funds
from a casino, all right?
Once you get the checks to the bank,
trust is untouchable.
You can't tell
nobody nothing, right?
Well, what is there to tell?
I mean, you boys won
that money gambling, didn't you?
$32,000 pays off
the reverse mortgage.
And those bastards paid
the property tax from 2012 to now.
That's another $11,000.
So, $43,000
and you are free and clear.
Just have the loan officer
fax me a release of lien,
and I'll get that over
to the lease manager at Chevron.
- The fax number is on the card.
- Okay.
How much you making
on this deal?
Not near as much
as I'm risking.
Why you doin' it, then?
You know, they loaned
the least they could.
Just enough to keep your mama poor
on a guaranteed return.
Thought they could swipe
her land for $25,000.
That's just so arrogant,
it makes my teeth hurt.
To see you boys...
pay those bastards back
with their own money?
Well, if that ain't Texan,
I don't know what is.
Thank you.
Now, they can foreclose
on Friday.
Come hell or high water,
be at the bank in Childress
on Thursday.
Knowing them fuckers,
they will close early.
- TOBY: We'll be there.
- Oh, and, Toby.
The trust needs to be managed
by a bank.
You really wanna cover
your tracks?
You get Texas Midland
to handle this trust.
So, what's the plan?
We're gonna watch that bank
like a deer feeder.
In time, we'll be right.
Now, let's see
what they got to eat here.
Howdy, ma'am.
How you doing today?
Hot, and I don't mean
the good kind.
So, what don't you want?
Pardon?
What don't you want?
Oh, well, uh,
I think I'll just, uh...
You know, I've been working here
for 44 years.
Ain't nobody
ever ordered nothing
but T-bone steak
and a baked potato.
Except this one asshole
from New York
tried to order trout
back in 1987.
We don't sell
no goddamned trout.
T-bone steaks.
So, either you don't want
the corn on the cob,
or you don't want
the green beans.
So, what don't you want?
I don't want green beans.
I don't want
green beans either.
Steaks cooked medium rare.
- Can I get my steak cooked...
- That weren't no question.
All right.
Iced tea for you boys.
Iced tea would be great.
Iced tea, yep.
Thank you, ma'am.
WAITRESS:
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
Nobody's gonna rob
this son of a bitch.
My word.
TANNER:
How's she feel?
She runs good.
Ain't gonna win any races.
TANNER:
Got New Mexico plates.
She got a top?
How she came.
- We'll take her.
-
TANNER:
Don't report it stolen till Friday.
The guy from Chevron
is dropping off the lease agreement.
Are you okay dealing with that
by yourself?
You okay being with Debbie
by yourself?
Remember,
he ain't the enemy.
Just take the papers,
say thank you.
The oil man is the enemy,
make no mistake.
He just ain't ours.
I'll be back
to the ranch by dark.
I will be waiting.
Drive like a schoolteacher
with all this shit in the back.
Sure feels like beer o'clock.
Ask and you shall receive.
DEBBIE:
Mama died.
When?
A few weeks ago.
Well, good riddance.
No offense.
You okay?
You?
Here's the money I owe you.
I guess you'll be selling
the ranch.
It goes to the boys.
- Really?
- Mmm.
It's been put in a trust.
What's that mean?
It means no one can sell it.
Great.
Something else
I got to take care of.
Hi.
Where's your brother?
I don't know.
Friend's house, I guess.
How come you ain't in school?
School don't start yet.
Just two-a-days
for football right now.
Your grandmother died.
I'm giving the ranch
to you and your brother.
Remember going out there
when you was little?
What am I supposed to do
with a ranch?
Anything but sell it.
We found oil on it.
You and your brother ain't gonna
have to worry about money no more.
Now...
you may be hearing
a lot of things about me and...
your uncle.
Don't be like us.
You hear me?
Whatever I hear,
I won't believe.
No, you believe it.
I did all of it.
Now, you, you do it different.
Ain't gonna drink it?
You tell me not to be like you,
and then you offer me a beer.
Which is it?
Good boy.
- How are the boys?
- What are you doin'?
Insurance.
I don't want
that shit in the car.
We'll be running two cars
next time, brother.
They'll ride with me.
ALBERTO:
So, this is your plan?
We're just gonna sit here
and see if this is the branch
they rob next.
What would you rather do?
You wanna drive 80 miles
back to Olney
and look for more fingerprints
that we ain't gonna find?
Or you wanna drive 200 miles
back to Lubbock
and look at mugshots that don't matter
'cause nobody knows
what these sons of bitches
look like?
Or we can just wait here
for them to rob this bank,
which is the one thing I'm pretty
damn sure they are going to do.
I know what you're doing.
You're trying to make this last
as long as you can
because the longer it lasts,
the farther you are
from that front porch.
No, I'm waitin' for these boys
to make a mistake.
So far they ain't, but they will.
And they're gonna
make it here.
So, just relax.
Enjoy this little town.
Do you wanna live here?
Got an old hardware store
that charges twice
what Home Depot does,
one restaurant with
a rattlesnake for a waitress.
I mean, how is anybody
supposed to make a living here?
People have made a living here
for 150 years.
Well, people lived in caves
for 150,000 years,
but they don't do it no more.
Well, maybe your people did.
Your people did, too.
A long time ago,
your ancestors was the Indians...
till someone came along
and killed them,
broke 'em down,
made you into one of them.
was my ancestors' land.
Everything you can see.
Everything you saw yesterday.
Till the grandparents
of these folks took it.
And now, it's been taken
from them.
Except it ain't
no army doing it.
It's those sons of bitches
right there.
You thinking about tomorrow?
Ain't you?
The little hotel clerk.
Why is it always
the sweet ones
that are such devils
when you get them revved up?
Wouldn't know.
Never had a sweet one.
Yeah, you like them pissed off,
lookin' for someone to blame.
Sure seems that way.
It's a good thing
you're doing.
We're doing it.
Go easy on the bank teller
tomorrow.
I'll be as gentle
as a young nurse.
ALBERTO:
You coming?
MARCUS:
On my way.
Hey.
TANNER:
Shit.
Morning.
TOBY:
You want some breakfast?
TANNER:
Yeah, breakfast sounds good.
So we hit the Jayton branch first,
then Coleman, right?
TOBY: Yeah, that should get us
what we need.
TANNER:
Let's do this.
Ugh... shit.
TOBY: That's not part
of the fucking plan.
TANNER: The bastards
closed down the branch.
What now, little brother?
Coleman.
- TOBY: What the hell you doing?
- TANNER: We gotta head to Post.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get...
- We got to head to Post.
- What are you talking about?
We got to head to Post.
We're going to Coleman.
There's only one teller
in Coleman.
Whatever we get
won't be enough.
We go to Coleman right now.
If that ain't enough,
we head to Post.
If we don't leave now for Post,
we won't get there till noon.
You don't wanna rob a bank
at lunchtime, do you?
Yeah, we don't know the patterns
of folks out there.
The patterns
are the same everywhere.
All these towns are dead.
Post ain't no different.
It's a bigger bank.
We'll leave your car
just out of town.
- Shit.
-
-
-
I think I got this figured.
First two banks,
they were Texas Midland Banks.
All right, there are seven
branches altogether.
The main branch
is in Fort Worth.
They're not gonna
mess with that.
All right, they hit
the branch in Olney.
They hit the one
in Archer City.
- Then there's the one here.
- Which they did not hit.
Alberto, will you please
follow me?
Don't let... just keep
your mouth shut
and just listen
to what I'm gonna say.
There's the one here...
then there's the one
in Childress.
There's the one in Jayton.
That one's closed.
I know that one's closed!
I know that one's closed,
Alberto.
That's my point.
Jayton is closed.
That just leaves Post.
They're not gonna mess
with the bank in Childress.
That's a fairly
decent-sized town.
The branch in Vernon
wasn't Midlands and they hit that.
Yeah, one of them did.
Alone.
Then he ran all the way
across the road to get to the car.
I think his partner had no idea
that was gonna happen.
What does that mean to us?
It means that the only branch
that fits the bill is in Post.
Well, then let's go.
The town looks busy.
Little bit.
My word.
It's too big.
That's what she said.
It's no good.
Aw, this ain't
your first rodeo.
Bigger bank...
more money.
TANNER: Everybody,
get on the fucking ground!
Get on the fucking ground!
Young ladies, get on
the fucking ground! Now!
Sir, down!
On the ground! Now!
Thank you very much.
Tellers, stand up!
Open the drawers!
TOBY:
Get down!
TANNER:
Take three steps back!
Open the fucking drawer,
young lady!
Are you deaf and dumb?
I said open
the motherfucking drawer!
- TOBY: You, down!
- All right. Oh, please.
TANNER:
Very good.
Someone's paying attention.
Now get on
your motherfucking knees!
Hey!
- Stay down!
-
All right.
-
-
Dude.
TANNER:
Hey, hey, let's go!
WOMAN:
TANNER:
Jesus fucking Christ.
The whole goddamn town
is shooting at us.
Get in the back.
Get in the fucking back.
-
-
MAN: Come on, let's go!
Get in the car!
Don't let them get away!
TANNER: How you doing
back there, little brother?
TOBY:
You fucking killed them.
TANNER:
These concealed carry permits
sure complicate
a bank robbery, don't they?
It's not my fault
it was payday.
TOBY:
This has gone too far, Tan.
No one was supposed
to fucking die.
TANNER:
It was them or us. Take your pick.
Yeah, go, Margaret.
Texas Midlands in Post
has just been hit.
Ah! What did I tell you?
Yeah.
- Yeah!
- Locals are in chase.
Suspects escaping west
- in an old Bronco.
-
All right, Margaret, keep us posted.
We're on our way there.
Give me an Indian whoop.
Come on.
-
-
These boys are gonna go down.
Let's get some giddy-up music
going on there.
MAN:
Oh, please, not that.
For the love of God,
would you fall into the light?
Yeah.
Hey, hey. Come on.
Snap out of it.
- Snap the fuck out of it.
-
Shit, let me see that.
You're hit.
Boy, you're hit.
Get the back.
Well, you'll live.
It's a through and through.
Compress it. Wrap it up.
You got to wrap it up tight.
Front and back,
front and back.
Wrap it tight.
Oh, brother, hear me now,
hear me clear.
Unless you wanna be a black mark
on your sons' lives,
I need you mountain lion mean.
-
- You hear me?
TOBY:
I hear you.
- TANNER: Mountain lion mean.
- TOBY: Yeah.
Yeah. It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
- Hold on.
- Yeah.
Go.
Here, take the money.
- Let's go.
- Get to the casino.
Change the money
like we planned.
This was your plan,
and it worked.
Every step of the way.
Trust it.
Where are you headed?
Don't be stupid.
I love you, Toby.
I mean it.
I love you, too.
Hey, Tobe, go fuck yourself.
Go fuck yourself.
-
-
As I walked out
one sunny morning
I spied a young cowboy
a loping along
His hat was laid back
- His spurs were a jinglin'
-
And as he come near me
He's singing this song
Yippee hiyiyo.
You little doggies.
It's your misfortune
and none of my own
This is what they call
white man's intuition.
Sometimes a blind pig
finds a truffle.
It's your misfortune
and none of my own
RANGER:
Back up! Oh, shit!
Go! Move!
My word.
All right, We're gonna need
a SWAT unit up here
and a helo to pin
these boys down.
DISPATCHER:
RANGER:
RANGER 2: He's got a rifle.
Get down!
RANGER 3: He's on the ridge!
He's on the ridge!
RANGER 3:
Come on, I see him!
MARCUS:
Yep, just one.
There's supposed
to be two of them.
- Maybe the town folks got one.
-
Well, if they did,
they got the smart one.
This old boy
is out of his mind.
Why don't you slip up this canyon
and tomahawk that son of a bitch?
Ranger down.
Call it in.
Get back! Back!
Back those trucks up!
Get back!
Get these trucks back.
Back up!
Back them up.
How well do you know the land
around here?
Like the back of my hand.
All right, he's hid up
in that brush on that hill.
Can you get me up there
behind him?
Give me a half hour,
I'll have that bastard
field dressed on the hood
of my truck.
MARCUS: I can't let you do that.
You just get me there.
LOCAL: That's gonna be a 500-yard shot
if he's where you said.
MARCUS:
Just get me there!
Shit.
TROOPER:
How are you doing?
Good. You?
Where are you headed?
Ruidoso.
Where you from?
Hamlin.
Taking the scenic route?
Taking the only way I can.
They got the road closed
at Post.
Everywhere you turn
they got the road closed.
- You got your license on you?
- Yes, I do.
Wait right there.
Yes, sir.
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Have a good day.
Thanks much.
-
-
You're pretty winded.
You oughta let me take the shot.
Hell, it's my gun.
Not on your life.
He's mine.
I got him.
I got you.
Lord of the Plains.
That's me.
-

REPORTER:...definitely something
out of a dime-store novel.
Texas Highway Patrol
and the locals
chased the robbers
to this hillside behind me,
20 miles west of town,
where the gunfight continued.
Ranger Marcus Hamilton
killed one of the gunmen
using a rifle he actually borrowed
from a resident here.
We don't know the name
of that suspect yet...
Lucky guy.
Just in the nick of time, too.
What are the odds?
Now,
this, uh, satisfies
both the reverse mortgage loan
and the, uh...
and the back taxes that we've paid
on your mother's behalf.
We do that as courtesy,
of course.
You can fax the release of lien
to that number.
An attorney?
All right, well, I'll... I'll get that
faxed over to your attorney
by the end of the week.
It is the end of the week.
I wanna watch you do it.
Well, it takes a little time
to prepare.
I got all day.
Here we go.
Okay. That's it.
And it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.
Let me ask you a question.
Do y'all manage trusts?
-
-
RANGER: Hey, Marcus,
ain't you supposed to be retired?
MARCUS:
Howdy.
- Shelley.
- Nice to see you.
- MARGARET: Well, hey, Marcus.
- Hey, Margaret.
Been awhile.
How's life as a civilian?
Oh, just, you know...
Think I can take a peek
at Mr. Howard's file?
Tanner Howard.
Oh, come on.
I ain't got nothing better to do.
It's at my desk.
Uh...
Killed his father
in a hunting accident, huh?
MARGARET: I'd love to know what
he was hunting in the barn in April.
for aggravated assault.
Cellmate was released in 2012.
Before that,
he served seven years
on bank robbery charges
up in Big Spring.
Been trying to track him down,
but no luck so far.
You all are off the brother?
There's nothing that links him
to the robberies.
Now, what about
that little waitress in Vernon?
Yeah, we showed her photos.
She said she didn't
recognize him.
Pretty upset you took
her tips as evidence.
She sure was sassy.
You show that
to that old timer?
Yep. He said he didn't look
like the fella from the diner.
He didn't recognize
Tanner's photo either.
Yeah, tried to get a court order
on his bank accounts and the ranch,
DA wouldn't do it.
Toby's got no record.
He's never been arrested.
His only court appearance
was at his divorce.
He don't fit the bill, Marcus.
People don't start out
robbing banks.
They graduate to it
like his asshole brother.
Besides,
when we was out there,
we saw two crews from Chevron
capping wells
and putting in pumpjacks.
Engineers out there
said they're gonna pull
off that place.
You just try convincing a judge
to issue warrants on somebody
set to clear $50,000 a month
for robbing $40,000 from the bank
that manages the family trust.
Midland manages the trust?
You'd think they'd want
this thing figured out.
I don't think the bank cares
about anything
but keeping that trust
right where it is.
Hell, they were less cooperative
than Toby's attorney.
Marcus, he's not a suspect
and you are retired.
Oh, I hear you.
You like my desk?
I don't hate it.
Hey, I'll see you, Marcus.
Know who I am?
I'm the man
who killed your brother.
I know.
I also know you're retired
and you're trespassing.
Well, you could shoot me now
and be within your rights.
You toting a gun and all,
how convenient.
I figure you got one, too.
Mind if I sit?
Go ahead.
You want a beer?
Sure.
I ain't on duty no more.
Thanks.
It's nice out here
in this breeze, huh,
now that it's cooled down.
How did you do it?
Oh, never mind.
I'll figure that out in time.
Why?
Why did you do it?
I know why your brother,
Tanner, did it.
He robbed them banks
because he liked it.
He shot my partner 300 yards away
'cause he liked it.
It made him feel good.
If I hadn't blown
his shit for brains out,
there'd be a new truck out front
with jet skis
or whatever else
he could think to buy.
He'd spend it all just to give
an excuse to steal some more.
But not you.
There's nothing new
around here...
except them pumpjacks.
Each one of them
making you a month
what you and your brother stole
from all four banks combined.
Help me understand, then.
Help me understand
why four people died...
so you could steal money
that it don't seem you've spent,
that it don't seem you need.
You got a family?
My partner had a family.
A big one.
They don't got no pumpjacks
in their backyard.
- I didn't kill your friend.
- Yes, you did.
By setting this thing
in motion.
You expect me to believe
your dimwitted brother planned this?
Oh, no.
This was smart.
This was you.
I've been poor my whole life.
So were my parents,
their parents before them.
It's like a disease...
passing from generation to generation,
becomes a sickness.
That's what it is.
Infects every person you know...
but not my boys.
Not anymore.
This is theirs now.
Now, I ain't never killed
no one in my life,
but if you want me to start with you,
let's get on with it, old man.
See if you can grab that pistol
before I blast you off this porch.
- Howdy.
- What's going on?
The hogs are back
in the garden.
Feral hogs tearing up this place
something fierce.
Who's this?
I'm an old friend
of your husband.
Ex-husband.
I'm just working on the house.
Oh, you don't live here?
No, it's not mine.
It's theirs.
Oh.
The things we do
for our kids, huh?
Well...
I best be going.
Ma'am.
Me, too, Debbie.
I'm gonna wash up,
be back around 9:00 tomorrow
to finish the front.
Start painting the extension
and then help Randy
with his homework
when he gets back
from school, okay?
Okay.
Hey.
I rent a little house in town.
If you wanna stop by
and finish this conversation,
you're welcome anytime.
Oh, I'd like that.
I'll be seeing you.
Yeah.
Soon, I hope.
I'm ready to be done
with this.
You'll never be done with it
no matter what.
It's gonna haunt you, son,
for the rest of your days.
But you won't be alone.
It's gonna haunt me, too.
If you stop by,
maybe I'll give you peace.
Maybe.
Maybe I'll give it to you.
