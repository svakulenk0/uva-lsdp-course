IN THE HOT DESERT SUN
A MAN'S HEART GROWS COLD
SAND-FILLED WINDS
RUST HIS SOUL
TILL HIS HEART LIKE A ROCK
WITH NOWHERE TO ROAM
BUT AIMLESSLY ON AND ON
WHEN LIFE'S BEEN NOTHING
BUT A DIRTY DEAL
AND THE DIRTIER IT GETS
THE BETTER HE FEELS
THEN HE'S GONE TOO FAR
HE'LL PLANT NO SEED
HE'S JUST
A TARNISHED TUMBLEWEED
OOH
OOH, OOH
TUMBLEWEED
WHAT IS IT
A TARNISHED MAN WANTS
WITHIN HIS TARNISHED HAND
HIS BONY FINGERS
HOLDING FAST
TO LUSTFUL THINGS
THAT NEVER LAST
DRIVEN ON
BY ENDLESS GREED
THIS TARNISHED TUMBLEWEED
HE'S A TARNISHED
TUMBLEWEED
OOH
OOH, OOH
TUMBLEWEED
OUR PASSIONS ARE LIKE
FIRE AND WATER--
GOOD SERVANTS
BUT POOR MASTERS.
THE LEGEND OF CHILE VERDE
TELLS OF MEN AND WOMEN...
WHO BECAME SLAVES
TO THEIR PASSIONS.
THEY PAID THE PRICE
HERE UNDER THE BLISTERING,
BURNING, BLAZING,
SCORCHING, ROASTING,
TOASTING, BAKING, BOILING,
BROILING, STEAMING,
SEARING, SIZZLING,
GRILLING, SMOLDERING,
VERY HOT NEW MEXICO SUN.
FOR THERE IS A SAYING
IN THESE PARTS:
THOSE WHO LUST IN THE DUST
SHALL DIE IN THE DUST.
MY GIN !
OH, MY GOD.
I'M GONNA DIE
FROM THIRST OUT HERE.
OH, NO !
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
ONLY A FEW MORE LITTLE MILES.
A FEW ITSY-BITSY, EENY-WEENY
LITTLE MILES,
AND THEN YOU COULD DROP DEAD,
YOU MISERABLE HUNK OF SHIT.
OH !  OH, YEA,

WHO ARE YOU ?
WHERE'D YOU COME FROM ?
I SAID, WHO ARE YOU ?
PUT THAT DOWN.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF ME.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
YOUR FILTHY WAY WITH ME UNDER
THE HOT DESERT SUN, AREN'T YOU ?
YOU'RE GOING TO RAVAGE ME
LIKE I'VE NEVER BEEN
RAVAGED BEFORE,
YOUR HOT SWEAT
SLIDING OVER MY BODY
AS WE ROLL IN THE DUST,
AS YOU VIOLATE
MY INNERMOST PARTS,
AS YOU POUND AGAINST ME
IN ORGASMIC ANIMAL PASSION.
OH, GOD,
YOU'RE DISGUSTING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
DON'T LEAVE ME
OUT HERE, MISTER.
OH, I BEG YOU.
MY ASS IS ON ITS LAST LEGS.

YOU EVER HEAR OF HIM ?
PUERCOS, ANIMALES.
I'LL TELL YA, MISTER,
I'VE HAD SOME TOUGH SCRAPES
IN MY LIFE,
BUT THIS ONE'S BEEN THE WORST.
IT WAS YESTERDAY EVENING.
I WAS FEELING GOOD.
I WAS HALFWAY TO CHILE VERDE,
AND I HADN'T GOT LOST ONCE.
OH, GOOD AFTERNOON, GENTLEMEN.
TRUST IN THE LORD,
AND HE SHALL PROVIDE.
COULD YOU TELL ME,
IS THIS THE RIGHT ROAD
TO CHILE VERDE ?
FUNNY LADY.
BEING A LEADER OF... MEN...
IS A VERY SOLITARY BUSINESS,
MISS.
I'VE BEEN VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT MY MEN'S LIBIDOS...
UNTIL YOU SO CONVENIENTLY
CAME ON THE SCENE.
I'M AFRAID
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, SIR.
ARE YOU SPEAKING ENGLISH ?
¿¿ ESO ES INGLES ?
POONTANG, POONTANG.

LITTLE LADY ?
MY CURSE IS THAT I'VE RECEIVED
THE EDUCATION BEFITTING
THE SON OF A BOSTON PREACHER,
MAY HE ROT IN HELLFIRE.
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU GET
THE THRUST OF MY MEANING.
MY MEN ARE AS HORNY
AS JACKRABBITS.
ISN'T HE CUTE ?
HURRY UP, BOYS.  WE GOT
A FORTUNE IN GOLD TO FIND.
HELP !  HELP !
NO, WAIT, STOP !
I'M A... VIRGIN.
A VIRGIN ?

THAT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
THEN I'LL GO FIRST.
I'VE HAD CARNAL KNOWLEDGE
WITH 215 WOMEN AND TWO GOATS.
AND A CHICKEN ?
HUH ?
BUT NONE OF 'EM
HAVE EVER MADE ME--
SNEEZE BEFORE.
I'M SORRY, SIR.
IT MUST BE MY PERFUME.
IT'S IMPORTED.
FROM WHERE ?
"MOBERGE, FRANCE."
I YIELD, BOYS.
SHE'S ALL YOURS.
IT WAS TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE.
THEY HAD THEIR WAY WITH ME
FOR HOURS.
THEY JUST WOULDN'T STOP.
ANYONE LIKE TO TRY AGAIN ?
HOW ABOUT YOU,

I HEAR THEY GOT A CANTINA.
I'M GONNA GET ME A JOB

WANTED TO BE A SINGER.
I'VE BEEN WORKING
IN A HARDWARE STORE IN SANTA FE
SINCE I WAS 14.
OKAY, SO I WAS
A DANCE HALL GIRL, OKAY ?
I HAD TO LOOK AFTER MYSELF.
I NEVER KNEW MY REAL PARENTS.
MEN ARE CRUEL SONS OF BITCHES.
DID YOU KNOW YOUR DADDY ?
YOU PROBABLY NEVER HAD ONE.
OH, BOY, I'VE JUST BEEN
TALKING AWAY ABOUT MYSELF.
YOU SURE KNOW HOW TO WORM
A GIRL'S SECRETS OUT OF HER.
MAYBE I'LL FIND ME
A RICH HUSBAND IN CHILE VERDE.
HOW MUCH FURTHER
IS IT ANYWAY ?
IT'S SO HOT.
I'D BE BETTER OFF TALKING
TO CACTUS KAPLAN OVER THERE.
OH, COME ON !

IT'S A MATTER OF HONOR.
THESE PEOPLE--
THEY ARE MY FRIENDS.
THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM.
AY, CHIHUAHUA !

YOU COULD EAT OFF THIS FLOOR,
AND YOU PROBABLY WILL.
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
SINCE YOUR LAST CONFESSION,
MY SON ?
ABOUT TWENTY YEARS.
AY !
I JUST HAD TO GET
A FEW THINGS OFF MY CHEST.
LET'S SEE.
FIRST, THERE WAS, UM,
THIS GIRL IN EL PASO,
HER MOTHER
AND HER GRANDMOTHER.
PSSST !
THEREAREOTHER WAYS
OF EARNING YOUR KEEP

I'D RATHER DIE FIRST.
WHY, SUGAR, YOU MUST'VE

WHY DO YOU STAY HERE ?
I GOT NO PLACE ELSE TO GO.
WHY DON'T YOU DO WHAT I DID
AND BUY A MULE ?
WITH WHAT ?  THERE AIN'T
NO WAY I'M EVER GONNA MAKE
THAT KIND OF MONEY.
I USED TO DREAM
THAT SOMEONE LIKE MR. WOOD
WOULD COME ALONG...
AND TAKE ME AWAY
FROM ALL THIS.
BUT I KNOW THAT AIN'T GONNA
HAPPEN NOW.  DO YOU THINK
HE CAME FOR THE GOLD ?
THE GOLD ?
DID I SAY "GOLD" ?
I MEANT "MOLD."  DO YOU THINK
HE CAME FOR THE MOLD ?
WHAT GOLD ?
MANY MEN LIKE HORSES,
MY SON.
BUT DOC HOLIDAYREALLY
LIKED HORSES, FATHER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE WAS DOING IN THE OKAY CORRAL
THAT EARLY IN THE MORNING ?
GET ME ANOTHER BOTTLE.
ROSIE, DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH ?
I KNOW WHEN I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
I FALL ON THE FLOOR.
HONEY, THIS STUFF ISN'T GONNA
SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS.
AIN'T NOTHING GONNA SOLVE
MY PROBLEMS EXCEPT--
YOU GOT A DRESS
I CAN BORROW ?
SURE.  COME ON.
AY, MI AMORCITA,
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
I WANT YOU ALWAYS.
I DIE FOR YOU,AMOR.
FORGET IT, FORGET IT.
BERNARDO, FORGET IT.
I GOT OTHER PLANS.
YES, I KNOW YOUR PLANS.
YOU WANT TO JUMP
ALL OVER THAT STRANGER.
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE HAS BEEN !
I SURE AS HELL KNOW
WHERE HE'S GOING.
I AM GOING TO...
CUT HIS HEART OUT !
AND THEN THERE WAS
THE TIME WITH THE TWO
LOCKJAW INDIAN MAIDENS.
YOU MEAN CHOCTAW INDIANS,
MY SON.
THERE ARE NO
"LOCKJAW" INDIANS.
THERE ARE NOW.
MY FRIENDS, MEXICANS,
MEMBERS OF THE CHILE VERDE
ROTARY CLUB,
THE STRANGER IS TOO BIG
FOR HIS DAMN BOOTS !
ARE WE GOING
TO STAND FOR IT ?
ARE WE ?
WE ALL KNOW WHY HE'S HERE,
DON'T WE ?
DON'T WE ?
HE'S AFTER THE GOLD.

THAT IS WHAT THIS ABEL WOODS
IS AFTER.  ARE WE GOING
TO GIVE IT TO HIM ?
- ARE WE ?
-   NO !
- NO !

I DO NOT LIKE
THE WAY THEY ACT.
OH.
LET THEM HAVE THEIR FUN.
FATHER, I HEAR A LOT OF FOLKS
TALKING ABOUT GOLD.
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT ?
I KNEW THAT'S WHY
YOU WERE HERE.
THE LEGEND OF THE GOLD
KEEPS THIS TOWN ALIVE.
THAT IS WHY
THEY ARE ALL HERE.
THESE ARE
RUTHLESS MEN...
AND WOMEN.
TAKE CARE, MY SON.
I ALWAYS DO.
MM, THEY'RE ALSO
VERY STUPID.
SOME OF THEM HERE FOR YEARS,
AND STILL THEY CANNOT SOLVE
THE PUZZLE.
WHAT PUZZLE ?
THE LIMERICK.
UNTIL THE LIMERICK IS SOLVED,
THE GOLD WILL NEVER BE FOUND.
JUST-- JUST HOW DOES
THIS LIMERICK GO ?
"THERE WAS A YOUNG FELLOW
FROM SCOTLAND...
"WHO ROBBED
THE NEW MEXICO HOT LAND.
"IN A GRAVE SITUATION,
"TWO BUTES-- HIS SALVATION--
HE BURIED THE GOLD,
BUT IN WHAT LAND ?"
YOU BELIEVE THIS LEGEND ?
WHO WAS IT SAID,
"SUPERSTITION IS THE RELIGION
OF FEEBLE MINDS" ?
SCHOPENHAUER ?
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
PLATO ?  NIETZSCHE ?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THEY BELIEVE THE LEGEND
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO.
GREED.
THANKS, FATHER.
THANK YOU,
MY FRIEND.
VAYA CON DIOS.
BE WATCHFUL.
OOH, WHAT'S THE MATTER ?

WHICH END TO USE.
SO WHAT DOES THAT MAKE YOU ?
THE ONLY WHORE IN CHILE VERDE !

MARGUERITA.

WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME ?
VENGEANCE IS MINE,
SAYETH THE LORD.
I WILL REPAY--
ST. PAUL'S EPISTLE
TO THE ROMANS,
CHAPTER 12, VERSE 19.
OF COURSE, ST. PAUL
NEVER HAD A DISCIPLE
GOT HIS NECK BROKE...
BY A SLUT
FROM A SANTA FE WHOREHOUSE.
OH, I LIKE THIS HOMBRE.
I AIN'T GOIN' ANYWHERE.
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.
EASY, CLARENCE, EASY.
THERE'LL BE PLENTY
OF TIME FOR THAT LATER.
THEN WHY DON'T YOU KEEP MOVING ?
WHAT ?
I SAID, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST KEEP MOVING ?
ABEL, THANK GOODNESS.  THESE MEN
WANTED TO TAKE ME AWAY.
AIN'T THAT GRAND ?
SO, YOU GOT A BOYFRIEND,
HUH, ROSIE ?
LISTEN HERE, ROSIE'S BEAU !
WE NEED HER TO FIND THE GOLD !
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE GOLD ?
SEARCH ME.
THAT'S WHAT
WE AIM TO DO.
DO NOT BE AFRAID, MY SON.
THEY WILL NOT SHOOT
WHILE I AM BESIDE YOU.
HA !  DON'T COUNT ON IT,
FATHER.
IT'S A GOOD DAY FOR ME
WHEN I GET TO KILL A PRIEST.
I'LL BE IN THE CHURCH.
WELL, HOW DO YOU
WANNA DO THIS, MISTER--
WOOD--
ABEL WOOD.
FLIP A COIN.
WHEN IT HITS THE DIRT,
START SHOOTING.
SOUNDS GOOD.

THINGS ARE HARD ALL OVER.
ADIOS, MR. WOOD.
BUT REMEMBER:  THE DAY
OF THY DEATH IS BETTER
THAN THE DAY OF THY BIRTH.
THAT'S...
ECCLESIASTES,
CHAPTER SEVEN, VERSE FIVE.

YOU DIDN'T THINK
THE BOYS AND ME--

OUR RESPECTS, DID YA ?

ALL THIS TIME !
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU !
SO WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT
IN THE OPEN ?
WE'LL DISCUSS
A BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP.
WHAT DO YOU SAY ?
IT'S MY ASS.
THERE'S ENOUGH THERE
FOR BOTH OF US.
PROMISE YOU WON'T SHOOT ?
ON MY MOTHER'S GRAVE.
IT AIN'T WORTH NOTHING,
I SWEAR.
WHAT ?
MY TATTOO.
IT'S ONLY HALF A MAP.
WITHOUT THE OTHER HALF
IT'S COMPLETELY USELESS.
I'LL BE.
THAT'S WHY I CAME
TO CHILE VERDE.
DON'T KILL ME, PLEASE.
YOU PROMISED
ON YOUR MOTHER'S GRAVE.
SO I DID.
YOU'LL BE SORRY TO HEAR
THAT OLD BITCH IS STILL
ALIVE AND KICKING.
OH, PLEASE,
LET ME LIVE.
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO PARIS.
C'EST LA VIE,ROSIE.
OH, LOOK.

ROSIE, YOU OKAY ?
OH, ABEL--
ABEL, IT WAS TERRIBLE.
HE--

HEY, TAKE IT EASY.
SHE'S HEAVY.
PUT HIM IN MY ROOM.
THERE WAS A YOUNG FELLOW
FROM SCOTLAND,
WHO ROBBED
THE NEW MEXICO HOT LAND.
"IN A GRAVE SITUATION,
TWO BUTES-- HIS SALVATION."
"THEY BURIED THE GOLD,
BUT IN WHAT LAND ?"
TWO BUTES HIS SALVATION--
BUTES.
TWO BUTES.
YEAH ?
SORRY TO DISTURB YOU,
MR. WOOD.
YOU MUST'VE HAD A HARD DAY
CHASING OUTLAWS.
ALL THAT HEAVY LIFTING.
- WHAT COULD I DO
FOR YOU, BIG ED ?
- I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU...
THAT YOU'RE THE FINEST MAN
I EVER MET.
YOU'VE BEEN REAL NICE TO ME,
AND I WON'T EVER FORGET IT.
THANKS, BIG ED.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
OH, I HOPE YOU GET
TO ABILENE ONE OF THESE DAYS.
THANKS.
YEAH ?
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT IF I FIND THE GOLD,
HALF OF IT'S YOURS.
- WHY WOULD YOU DO
A THING LIKE THAT ?
- BECAUSE YESTERDAY MORNING--
OH, HONEY--
THAT WAS THE BEST SHOWER
I EVER HAD.
I'LL BE BACK...
LATER.
OH, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE A MAN LIKE YOU
CAME TO CHILE VERDE.
OH ?  HOW LONG ?
A WEEK.
MAYBE LONGER.
YOU DON'T GET MANY OF ME
TO THE POUND.
HAVE A DRINK.
MM-HMM.
OOH, GEEZ.
MMM.
YEAH ?
CAN I COME IN ?
YOU ALWAYS WANTED ME,
HAVEN'T YOU ?
EVER SINCE FATE
FIRST BROUGHT US TOGETHER.
OH, SAY IT'S TRUE.
I KNEW IT.
OH, ABEL, MY DARLING,
SAY NOTHING.
LET'S JUST
SAVOR THIS MOMENT.
I'D LOVE TO SEE YOUR,
UM, WOUND.
UM, BIG ED LOOKED AT IT
JUST TEN MINUTES AGO.
WELL, ISN'T SHE
THE LUCKY ONE ?
WHY DON'T WE
TAKE THESE OFF, SHALL WE ?
- SHOULDN'T WE
TURN OUT THE LIGHTS ?
- DON'T BE SILLY.
HOW CAN I SEE
WHAT I'M DOIN' ?
GOODNESS.
IT'S GETTIN' BETTER
EVERY SECOND.
- Y-YEAH, IT IS.
- OH, MY, MY, MY.
I BET THERE AREN'T MANY
OF THOSE TO THE POUND EITHER.
YOU STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.
I'M GONNA GET YOU
SOME FRESH BANDAGES, OKAY ?
WELL, I AIN'T GOIN' NO PLACE--
UH, ANYPLACE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST
HEARD ABOUT THE LEGEND
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO,
I REALIZED THEN
THAT THIS TATTOO MIGHT HAVE
SOMETHIN' TO DO WITH THE GOLD.
I SOLD EVERYTHING I HAD
AND BOUGHT THAT STUPID MULE.
SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE HAS
THE OTHER HALF OF THAT MAP
ON THEIR BODY,
AND I NEED YOU
TO HELP ME FIND 'EM.
IT COULD BE A...
WOMAN.
I'LL SHARE EVERYTHING
WITH YOU-- EVERYTHING !
WHAT DO YOU SAY ?
WITH THE TWO HALVES OF THE MAP
ANDTHE LIMERICK,
WE'LL HAVE ALL THE PIECES
OF THE PUZZLE; WE CAN RIDE
OUT OF HERE TOGETHER !
WE'LL BE RICH BEYOND MY--
OUR--WILDEST DREAMS !
WELL, THAT'S
THE WHOLE STORY.
I LOVE YOU
WITH EVERY OUNCE OF MY BEING.
OH, ABEL, GIVE IT TO ME.
THIS WILL ONLY TAKE A MOMENT,
AND THEN, OOH--
HEY, BE CAREFUL
WITH THOSE SCISSORS.
-
-OKAY, BIG BOY,
ONE MOVE OUTTA YOU, ONE LIE,
AND I'LL BE WEARIN'
YOUR JINGLE-BOBS FOR EARRINGS.
NOT IF YOU FOLLOW MY DRIFT.
NOW, WHY DID YOU
COME BACK HERE FOR ROSIE, HUH ?
IT WASN'T FORLOVE,WAS IT ?
- SHE HAS A MAP.
- WHAT MAP ?
COULDN'T WE DISCUSS THIS UNDER
MORE FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES ?
NO, YOU JUST KEEP TALKIN'.

- SHE HAS HALF THE MAP
TO THE GOLD...
TATTOOED ON HER ASS.
OH, MY GOD.
HEY, GIMME THAT GUN
UNDER YOUR PILLOW, HUH ?

I THINK I'VE SOLVED
THE LIMERICK, FATHER.  IF I'M

I HAVE NO NEED FOR MONEY.

BURIED IN SCOTLAND ?
NO.
THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE--
BUTE.
OH, WE'RE RICH, FATHER.

TO LET THIS CHANCE PASS.
AMIGO,

ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.
OH, THINK NOTHING OF IT.  IT'S
JUST AN EARLY-MORNING CONDITION.
A LOT OF MEN GET IT.

THE NEW MEXICO HOT LAND.

MM, NICE WORK.
IWASGONNA HELP YOU,
BUT I SAW YOU WERE HAVIN'
SO MUCH FUN, I DECIDED
NOT TO DISTURB YOU.
HOW'D YOU FIND OUT ?
SAME WAY YOU DID.
NOW, THIS HERE WAS
ONE SMART SON OF A BITCH.
HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD
RECOGNIZE THE MAP OF SCOTLAND
ON TWO SEPARATE REAR ENDS ?
TWO BUTES--
ONE IN SCOTLAND,
THE OTHER ONE HERE.
OR TWO BEAUTIES--
THE LADIES.
YOU BASTARD !
YOU FIGURED ALL THAT OUT,
DIDN'T YOU, MR. WOOD ?
- YOU'RE SMARTER THAN SHIT.
- I BEEN AROUND.
I'M GLAD YOU USED
THE PAST TENSE ON THAT.
GOOD SENSE OF TIMING.
ADIOS.  DO YOU WANT IT
IN THE HEAD OR THE HEART ?
HOLD EVERYTHING !
BACK OFF.
WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.
- THERE'S ENOUGH HERE
FOR EVERYBODY.
- LIKE HELL THERE IS.
I BEEN LOOKIN' FOR THIS GOLD
FOR YEARS, AND I AIN'T
SHARIN' IT WITH NOBODY.
YOU UNDERSTAND ?
IT WAS MY ASS
THAT WAS TATTOOED-- MINE !
OURS !
DROP IT !
I KNEW IT !
JUST GIVE ME ONE EXCUSE
TO KILL YA-- JUST ONE.
ALL MY LIFE I'VE BEEN
RUNNIN' AROUND SANTA FE WITH
A STRANGE BIRTHMARK ON MY BUTT.
YOU COULDA ADVERTISED
IN THE PAPER OR SOMETHIN' !
I FIGURED IF I HUNG AROUND
CHILE VERDE LONG ENOUGH,
THE OTHER HALF WOULD
SHOW UP SOONER OR LATER,
BUT I NEVER IMAGINED
IT WOULD BE ON SUCH
A LOWLIFE, SLEAZY, NO GOOD--
SHUT UP !
GET BACK !
THIS ISNOTFAIR !
OH, GO AHEAD.
IF THERE ARE NO OBJECTIONS,
I'D SURE LIKE TO SEE WHAT IT IS
WE ALL CAME HERE FOR.
DAMN ME.
BULL... SHIT !
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
- MIND IF I TRY ?
BE MY GUEST.
COME AND GET IT.
GET AWAY FROM THAT GOLD !
EVERYBODY MOVE AROUND
A LITTLE BIT.
FATHER, AM I EVER GLAD
TO SEE YOU.
DROP THE GUNS, PLEASE.
THIS IS STOLEN TREASURE.
I THINK WE KINDA
FIGURED THAT OUT OURSELVES,
YOU OLD FART.
CACTUS KAPLAN, RIGHT ?
HE ROBBED THE LAS CRUCES BANK.
A POSSE TRACKED HIM DOWN,
SO HE BURIED THE GOLD WHEN
HE FOUND HE COULD NOT ESCAPE.
- WELL, HOW COME WE GOT
TATTOOS ON OUR ASSES ?
- HE DEVISED THE LIMERICK,
AND HE PUT THE LAST--
THE VITAL-- CLUE...
ON HIS INFANT DAUGHTERS.
HE WANTED YOU SISTERS
TO HAVE THE GOLD.
SISTERS ?
THE KAPLAN SISTERS ?
OY VEY.
YOU GIRLS WERE BROUGHT UP
BY SEPARATE FOSTER FAMILIES.
- HOW COME YOU KNOW ALL THIS ?
- WHEN I WAS A RABBI, I MARRIED
LUPITA AND CACTUS KAPLAN.
LOOK, CAN WE START
SHOOTING EACH OTHER NOW ?
NO OFFENSE, FATHER.
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING STORY,
BUT I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE GOLD
AND GET OUT OF HERE !
YOU HEARD THE FATHER.
THE GOLD IS OURS.
THAT'S HOW OUR DADDY WANTED IT.
I SOMEHOW DON'T FEEL
THAT'S THE FATHER'S INTENTION.
FOR 33 LONG YEARS
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THE PIECES TO COME TOGETHER.
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE--
WAITING IN THIS CESSPIT
FOR 33 LONG YEARS ?
SOME PEOPLE WOULD HAVE
GIVEN UP.
SOME PEOPLE HAVE
GONE CRAZY, BUT NOT ME.
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
BECAUSE I KNEW--
I KNEW THAT ONE DAY...
CACTUS'S LITTLE GIRLS WOULD
COME RIDING INTO CHILE VERDE,
AND I WOULD BE RICH !
RICH ENOUGH TO CAST THE DUST
OF THIS FORSAKEN LAND FOREVER
FROM MY SANDALS.
OH, I'M GOING TO TRAVEL--
LONDON, PARIS, VIENNA...
AND THEN-- THEN ROME !
THE VATICAN !
I'M GOING TO BE A POPE !
THIS MAN'S OATS AIN'T
ALL IN HIS FEED BAG.
OH, YE OF LITTLE FAITH.
IF THERE'S ONE THING I HATE,
IT'S A PUSHY PRIEST.
I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYONE WANTS
TO SPLIT THIS FOUR WAYS.
MARGUERITA.
WHAT ?
YOU'RE MY BIG SISTER.
I CAN'T KILL YOU.
THERE'S ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF US.
MMM. ¿¿ Y ESTOS ?
LOS MATAMOS.
HUH.
SHE SAYS THEY'LL KILL US.
LUCKY THING I SPEAK SPANISH.
HOW DO I KNOW
YOU'LL SHOOTTHEM?
TRUST ME.
OH, NO.
GO AHEAD AND SHOOT.
YOU CAN'T.
I KNOW WHY.
ABEL, ALL THOSE THINGS I SAID
TO YOU LAST NIGHT WERE TRUE.
- IS THAT WHY YOU WANTED
TO KILL ME JUST NOW ?
- THAT WAS A TRICK TO FOOL HER.
THIS WOMAN'S UNBELIEVABLE.
SHE JUST WANTS TO PUT YOU AWAY
LIKE SHE DID RED DICK.
SHUT UP, YOU DECEITFUL SLUT !
DON'T LISTEN TO HER.
I AIN'T LISTENING
TO EITHER OF YOU.
ABEL,
YOU AND ME--
WE'RE TWO OF A KIND.
- HA !
- WHEN WE MADE LOVE,
IT WAS FIREWORKS EXPLODIN'--
BIG, LONG ROMAN CANDLES
SHOOTIN' OFF INSIDE ME.
- WHEN WAS THIS ?
- THE DAY YOU ARRIVED
IN CHILE VERDE.
WE DID IT IN THE SHOWER,
AND IT WAS THE--
IN THE SHOWER ?
HOW COULD YOU ?
SEEMED LIKE THE THING
TO DO AT THE TIME.
YOU MEN ARE ALL THE SAME.
- YOU AIN'T GOT
NO BRAND ON ME.
- BUT I LOVE YOU.
YOU BITCH !
WHERE WAS I ?
OH, YES.
ABEL, I LOVE YOU.
GOD KNOWS I'VE TOLD YOU
ENOUGH TIMES.
THEN PROVE IT.
THROW YOUR GUN DOWN.
I'LL BE DAMNED.
I REALLY MEANT IT.
OH, OH, ABEL.
ADIOS, SUCKER.
SHE WAS GONNA KILL YOU.
I COULDN'T LET HER DO THAT.
SO, YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO SAVED ME BEFORE.
TWICE.
HALF OF THIS
BELONGS TO YOU.
ALL I NEED IS ENOUGH
TO GET ME TO ABILENE.
THANKS, BIG ED.
CALL ME EDNA.
ABEL !
ABEL !
I HOPE YOU WON'T LET
A LITTLE THING LIKE THIS
COME BETWEEN US.
OH, SURE, WE'VE HAD
OUR LITTLE UPS AND DOWNS,
BUT IT'S STILL NOT TOO LATE.
OH, ABEL,
CAN'T WE STILL BE FRIENDS ?
GIVE BIG ED EVERYTHING.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE GOLD.
OW !
BIG ED !
BIG ED, HONEY !
I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR WANTING ME DEAD.
YOU ARE OLD, UGLY,
AND I'LL SEE YOU GET
JUST WHAT'S COMIN' TO YA.
ABEL--
ABEL, MY LOVE !
ABEL !
WHAT'S THE USE.
OH, WELL.
MAYBE HE'LL BE BACK TOMORROW.
AFTER ALL,
TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY.
IN THE HOT DESERT SUN
A MAN'S HEART GROWS COLD
SAND-FILLED WINDS
RUST HIS SOUL
TILL HIS HEART
LIKE A ROCK
WITH NOWHERE TO ROLL
BUT AIMLESSLY ON AND ON
WHEN LIFE'S BEEN NOTHIN'
BUT A DIRTY DEAL
THE DIRTIER IT GETS
THE BETTER HE FEELS
THEN HE'S GONE TOO FAR
HE'LL PLANT NO SEED
HE'S JUST
A TARNISHED TUMBLEWEED
OOH
OOH, OOH
TUMBLEWEED
WHAT IS IT
A TARNISHED MAN WANTS
WITHIN HIS TARNISHED HAND
HIS BONY FINGERS
HOLDIN' FAST
TO LUSTFUL THINGS
THAT NEVER LAST
DRIVEN ON
BY ENDLESS GREED
THIS TARNISHED TUMBLEWEED
YOU KNOW, HOME AIN'T NOTHIN'
BUT A FOUR-LETTER WORD
AND SETTLIN' DOWN, WELL
THAT'S JUST PLAIN ABSURD
I TELL YA
NOTHING'S WHAT HE'S GOT
AND NOTHING'S
WHAT HE'LL NEED
HE'S JUST
A TARNISHED TUMBLEWEED
OOH
OOH, OOH
TUMBLEWEED
TUMBLEWEED
