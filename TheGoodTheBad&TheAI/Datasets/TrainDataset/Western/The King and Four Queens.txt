A man ride like that'll kill himself.
Save us the trouble.
Hey, stranger.
Give a man a hand?
Sure thing,
old-timer.
Ah. I'll heave,
you guide it.
Okay.
DAN: That's a nice piece of
stone. Who's the lucky customer?
SWEET: Don't rightly know.
Mean not dead yet?
Dead two years.
If he is dead.
Say, this is a rather interesting
line of work you're in.
Can't complain.
Buried the
barber yesterday.
Well, that's it.
Thank you.
Oh, hey.
How would you like to ride
over to Wagon Mound with me
and make two dollars?
I already got two dollars.
Thanks just the same.
Well, I'll reckon the women
will meet me at the bridge.
You know, the first stone
I took over to Wagon Mound,
I started across that
bridge like an idiot.
Darn near had
my head blowed off.
You don't say.
Must be mighty touchy
folks live out that way.
Son, if you had a hundred
thousand dollars stashed away,
you'd be a mite
touchy yourself.
Well, howdy do?
Morning.
Whiskey, please.
Hey, you, uh... Would you mind
if I borrowed your fixings there?
Help yourself, friend.
Thanks.
Riding through?
Hmm.
Bound where, friend?
Wagon Mound, friend.
Wagon...
You hear that, Claude?
The traveler's going
to Wagon Mound.
You know Ma McDade?
No. Can't say I do.
You'll meet her. She'll
be that nice old lady
that'll put a bullet
in your head.
What's your line,
friend?
I sell.
Sell what?
Notions.
You take my advice, you
hear? Stay out of Wagon Mound.
Ain't nothing there but a
burned out town and five widows.
Oh, maybe I could do a job
of selling, if they've got
some money to spend.
Only a hundred-thousand
dollars in gold dust
buried somewhere. That's all.
Buried gold doesn't
draw much interest.
Drawed an awful lot of
interest around here.
Them McDade girls
cools them off pretty fast.
Did you ever hear
of the McDade boys?
Oh, those McDades, huh?
They pulled their last job
about two years ago.
The Red Drop mine shipment.
They stuck it up and beat it
back to Wagon Mound.
It was a nice
little town then.
Hmm. Take the gold
with them?
Mmm-hmm.
A lot of good
it did them.
Posse right
on their heels.
They holed up
in a barn
to make a stand.
You know what? Somebody threw
a lighted lamp in the window.
They were gonna smoke 'em out.
But that lamp landed
smack dab on the top
of a keg of powder.
You know,
that's a mighty
interestin' story.
There's only
one thing wrong.
What's that?
I hear one of those
McDades has been operating
up in Dakota country.
Sure. The one
that got away.
Which one?
You name him, friend.
Boone, Prince, Matt, Roy.
Take your pick.
We found three bodies
in them ashes.
One of 'em
ducked out of the barn
before it went blooey.
Well, I wouldn't
count on him to leave
that gold lyin' around.
Oh, it's there all right.
He wasn't cartin' no baggage
when he left.
I was in that posse, friend.
I helped turn that town upside
down lookin' for that loot.
Never found a smell of it.
You just say as
what them widows
is hangin' around for.
Just go ahead, ask.
Yeah, I was wondering
about those widows.
They'll be there.
Waitin'.
Ma and those four wives
taken over that hotel.
They're waitin' for
that livin' McDade
to come back
so they can split
that gold dust.
And they don't want
no nosey strangers
pryin' around.
Yeah.
Well, thanks for
the entertainment.
You don't believe us,
do you?
See that?
A luck piece.
A McDade luck piece.
All four of 'em had 'em.
Used to wear 'em
around their neck.
Did you ever try to
shoot a 20 dollar
gold piece on the fly?
Them McDades can do it.
Their ma can do it.
And I hear tell
them girls can
do it, too.
So, where'd
you get this?
Found it layin'
alongside the barn
after we put that fire out.
Well, that's a nice
little souvenir.
Well, as long as
you plan on goin'
to Wagon Mound,
I'll buy you
your last drink.
Thanks, but that one
hasn't been put
in a bottle yet.
Too bad, Claude,
I would have liked to
knowed him better.
What are you lookin' at?
He seen the sign.
My name's McDade.
What's yours?
Kehoe. Dan Kehoe.
You know where you're at?
I saw your sign.
Says "Keep out,"
don't it?
Why didn't you?
A fellow told me
about this place.
Said if I was
ever in trouble,
to head for here
and ask
the lady of the house
to put me up.
What fella?
We didn't change cards.
What'd he look like?
I never saw him clear.
It was dark in that cell.
Cell?
We spent the night
together in jail,
up in Dakota Territory.
I told him I had
a job of work to do
in these parts
and expected to do
some hard running
afterwards.
That's when
he mentioned
Wagon Mound.
What was he in for?
I never heard.
Come morning,
he was gone.
Did he leave
no word for me?
Think back, mister.
Didn't he tell you
nothin' to tell me?
Would you mind getting me
my waistcoat, please?
Thank you.
You lose somethin',
mister?
You, uh, wouldn't have
the makings on you,
would you?
Answer what I asked you.
No, ma'am.
Don't lie to me, mister.
What would I want
to lie for?
My trail's hotter than
the Fourth of July.
You probably heard
some of the fireworks.
I heard 'em.
I'm played out.
I couldn't beat
my own mother
from a standing start.
You're all the luck
I got left, good or bad.
Oh, I know what
you're thinking, ma'am.
If the law
should track me here,
you're in for trouble.
The law don't come
to Wagon Mound.
MA: I see you got yourselves
all fixed up, huh?
Well, it won't do you no good.
He's just stayin' the night.
Who is he?
Says his name is Kehoe.
Dan Kehoe.
You want someone
should sit up
with him? I...
MA: No, I don't!
I don't want any of you
goin' near him.
Is he handsome?
MA: I don't know.
I'm too old to tell.
A man on the dodge,
in strange country,
and he just happens
to stumble
into Wagon Mound.
That was a piece
of luck, wasn't it?
It weren't all luck.
Reckon you got
a right to know.
Somebody steered him here.
What do you mean?
Somebody passed the word
that he'd find a welcome
in Wagon Mound.
That ain't so strange.
It could have been
just about anybody.
Could have been Matt.
MA: No.
Why not?
Why not my man?
Or hers? Or hers?
Because, if it were
my boy, he'd have
sent word to his Ma.
Or to us.
One of us.
Well, how do we know
he'd send word?
We've sat in this hole
for two years, waitin'
for him to come back.
How do we know
he's comin' back at all?
Oh, he'll be back, Ruby.
He's a married man.
Also a very rich one,
now the gold doesn't have
to be divided four ways.
How do we know
there's any gold?
How do we know it ain't
just a trick to keep us here
till we're as old as she is?
MA: You know
because I say so!
Stay away from
that Kehoe man,
you hear?
I got a boy out there,
someplace.
I can't rightly
put a face
nor a name to him,
but I know he's there,
and I know
he's dependin' on his ma
to ride his fences
for him.
Now, one of you
belongs to him,
by the laws of God
and this Territory.
And when he comes back
to claim his property,
well, he's goin'
to find everything
just like he left it.
I mean everything.
Now, go on,
get up to bed!
Ruby? Do you think
I ought to set an extra
place for Mr. Kehoe?
How would I know?
You been
thinkin' about him
all night, huh?
I haven't even seen him,
except to help
carry him up to bed.
Well, save
your dreams.
He'll not have
eyes for you,
not in that black sack.
BIRDIE:
 When I was a little girl
 I used to play with toys
 Now that I'm a bigger girl
 I'd rather play with... 
Where is he?
Under the table.
He's still here,
ain't he?
Oh, he's here
all right.
My, don't we all look
lovely this morning?
Well, it's just
common decency to look
after our appearance.
Common it is.
I'd argue
about the decency.
I don't see
no bird nests
in your hair.
Oh, what a stink!
That's French
perfume!
Prince bought it
for me when he got
out of jail in Chicago.
You all kill me.
A man sleeps
under our roof for
the first time in two years,
and you all remember
you're women.
Runnin' around like
a bunch of scared chickens.
That's what you sound like
this mornin', too.
A bunch of cacklin' hens.
Lord, thanks for
the vittles. Amen.
What about Mr. Kehoe?
Won't he be wantin'
some breakfast?
He had his.
ORALIE: Is he feelin'
any better, Ma?
I expect so.
He's a big man,
that one. Strong.
Well, eat your breakfast.
What's wrong with you?
You all got the pip?
My sisters-in-law
are upset today.
A man's come into
their lives to remind them
of their widowhood.
We don't need
no reminders.
We got Ma.
You watch your tongue.
And as soon as you've ate,
you get upstairs and get
into some decent clothes.
And wash that rouge
off your face.
You look like
a dancehall girl.
You take that thing
out of your hair.
What's the matter?
You all forgot
you're married women?
On the contrary, Ma.
Mr. Kehoe's sudden arrival
has freshened the memory
of their loss.
In a pig's eye, it has.
I ain't nobody's fool.
I aim to see
he leaves here today.
It don't seem right,
puttin' a bullet in a man and
throwin' him out like that.
Well, I'll decide
what's right.
Sabina, as soon as
you've had breakfast,
you get up there
and fix his bandages,
and tell him
to get his day's rest,
'cause he'll get
nothin' else here.
Go on, now,
eat your breakfast.
Come in.
According to Ma,
we're about to
lose you, Mr. Kehoe.
I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.
I'm Sabina McDade.
I dressed you last night.
Don't you remember?
I wish I did.
I was referring
to your wound.
Sit down.
Much obliged
for the patchwork.
Oh, we doctor
all our sick animals,
Mr. Kehoe.
Where will you go
from here?
Back to Dakota?
Why Dakota?
I thought you had
a friend there.
Not in Dakota
or any place else.
Judging from the scars
I counted on you,
you have plenty of enemies.
You must have
at least one friend.
Well, I thought
the old lady
might be a friend,
but you tell me
she's turning me out
tail over tea kettle.
What about the man
who sent you here?
What about him?
Was he any of these?
The boys?
They look
like they knew
what was coming.
Do you see your friend,
Mr. Kehoe?
No.
Well, that's disappointing.
I was hoping
you'd say yes.
Then, instead of merely
suspecting it,
I'd know you were a faker.
How so?
If you'd pointed out
one of those men
as your friend...
You see, Mr. Kehoe,
that's not a photograph
of the McDade boys.
They never
had one taken.
I figured that.
Since we're identifying
McDades, which one
were you paired off with?
Boone was my husband.
Still is,
for all you know.
Yes.
You don't sound overjoyed.
I'm not sentimental,
Mr. Kehoe.
Least of all
about Boone.
We'd been married
exactly two hours
when he walked out of
our hotel room. "To get
some whiskey," he said.
A week later, I picked up
the paper and read
where he and the others
had robbed
a Touchstone bank.
So, you high-tailed it
for Wagon Mound
to get your cut?
I can't deceive you,
can I, Mr. Kehoe?
You wouldn't wait
two years for any man.
Money, a pile of it,
that would be
worth waiting for.
I never pretended otherwise,
not even to Ma.
It wasn't necessary.
She knew what was
due Boone's wife.
She even gave me
the wedding ring off
her own finger
to make up for the one
he promised me.
Beside Ma, every man
I ever met looked like
a weakling and a fool.
And if I were you,
Mr. Kehoe,
I wouldn't lie to her.
Or try to play
any games
with me, either.
There's a few
I'd like to try, miss.
MA: Sabina!
Comin', Ma!
BIRDIE:
 Wished I was in Tennessee
 Sittin' in a big armchair
 One arm 'round
the whiskey jug
 The other around my... 
Good morning, miss.
It's a
beautiful morning.
Eyes like yours,
miss, must see beauty
wherever they look.
Have a hot biscuit, mister?
Well, thank you kindly.
My name's Dan.
My name's Birdie,
mister...
You just let me
call you mister.
You don't know how good
that sounds to me.
For a man who doesn't
have a woman of his own,
this is a real treat.
Oh, cookin' biscuits
is nothin'.
I used to be
on the stage
in Chicago.
I was a dance...
I mean,
I was a actress.
Now, you didn't
have to tell me that,
Miss Birdie.
You've got a real flavor
in your voice.
Have I really?
You weren't
in the theater?
I've been privileged, ma'am.
All the world is a stage.
Pardon me.
Forgive me for staring, miss,
but, for a second there,
I thought that bullet
had sent me to an angel.
No angel, Mr. Kehoe.
I'm afraid here
we're all cursed for
the sin of violence.
All my life,
I've fought violence.
Fought it with fist and gun.
Whom do I have
the honor of addressing?
I'm Oralie,
widow to Roy McDade.
Oh, perhaps not,
Miss Oralie. Maybe Roy
is the one who was spared.
Unless the good Lord
has other plans for you.
Pardon me.
Ruby McDade.
From El Paso.
Ah, the city of sin.
I loved it.
You know, the old woman,
she don't miss
so many times.
You're a lucky man.
Yes, I've had
many complaints
to that effect.
I don't complain.
I'd like some of
your luck.
I'd be delighted
to share it with you,
Miss Ruby.
 Wished I was in Tennessee
 Sittin' in a big armchair
 One arm 'round
the whiskey... 
Hello!
You look kind of
cold in there.
Come on out,
and I'll show you how
Prince used to warm up
after taking a bath.
Thanks. But I don't think...
You know, first time
I saw you, I said,
"He makes me feel
like I used to
with my husband, Prince."
It must be the mustache.
Prince have a mustache?
No, that's what I mean.
I always wondered what it
would be like to get kissed
by a man that did have.
Uh, Miss Birdie,
you got me all wrong.
I'm not the kind of man
to take liberties
with a married woman.
Didn't I mention
I'm a widow?
How do you know?
I just know.
Prince wouldn't have
run off like that.
He always did just what
the others was doing.
If they wanted to stay
and get blown up,
he'd stay
and get blown up, too.
Well, looking at you,
I would say that was
mighty short-sighted of him.
Yeah, I was awful
sad about Prince.
I miss him
something terrible.
A woman doesn't hold
a candle to a man for
company, do you think?
That depends on
your point of view.
You must be freezin'
in there. Come on out,
I won't look.
Well, if you're not
comin' out,
I'm a comin' in.
 Wished I was in Tennessee 
SABINA:
Come up, Mr. Kehoe.
Expecting company?
We don't encourage
callers, Mr. Kehoe.
Well, maybe you ought
to change your ways.
A batch of beautiful
widow ladies and all.
The callers we do get
don't come courting.
They come hunting
something.
Maybe the same thing
you're hunting.
I'm not hunting anything,
Miss Sabina, except
a little peace and quiet.
Don't touch that bell rope
if you want to stay
in one piece.
What is it?
A dynamite fuse?
A relic
of the old days,
Mr. Kehoe.
When the boys
used to come back
from their business trips,
they flashed a signal
from up there
on the rim-rock.
And when it was
safe for them
to come on in,
Ma used to signal them
back by ringing the bell.
Oh! You figure there's
a McDade up there now,
waiting to hear it ring?
I don't, Mr. Kehoe.
But Ma still thinks
there'll be a signal
flashed any day.
That's why she wants
one of us to be
on the watch.
Well, that's kind of
a thankless job
if you don't believe
he's coming back, isn't it?
We take turns.
Besides,
it's a quiet place
to do my accounts.
Accounts?
Oh, yes.
We're in trade,
Mr. Kehoe.
We raise chickens.
Ma trades the eggs
in Touchstone for supplies.
Did you think we had
some invisible
means of support?
Well, I can't say
I've given the subject
much study, Miss Sabina.
How is the egg business
these days?
Oh, at the moment
there isn't any.
The hens aren't laying.
Maybe you need
a new rooster.
A penny for your thoughts,
Mr. Kehoe.
Oh, I wouldn't rob you.
Wouldn't you?
I got one thought
you can have.
How much will it cost me?
A 20 dollar
gold piece.
Well?
What's your thought,
Mr. Kehoe?
That you're
a worse liar
than I am.
Sabina!
Sabina!
Yes, Ma?
You seen anything
of that Kehoe man?
Have you lost him?
That don't signify.
Just wanna make sure
I ain't lost nothin' else.
You want me, ma'am?
Well, I do and I don't.
What's that?
You come into money?
Yeah, in a way.
You trust me
with my gun?
Thank you.
How come you done that?
 Wished I was in Tennessee
 Sittin' in a big... 
Listen!
The lot of you.
I know what you're all
day-dreamin' about.
You can forget it
right now, 'cause
it ain't gonna happen.
I don't know which
of my boys is alive,
and you don't know which.
But one of you
belongs to him,
and don't you forget that.
Myself, I wouldn't
give a plug-nickel
for the lot of you.
But I didn't do the pickin',
they done it for themselves,
and a fine lot
they picked, too.
A fussin' and a figetin'
ever since that blame
Kehoe man come here.
DAN: Were you
callin' me, ma'am?
If I was to call you
what I'm thinkin', this here
air would be blue, mister.
I got just
two words for you.
Pack. Go.
I been packed,
ever since last night.
The way things stand.
Well, I
figure that, that fellow
in Dakota must've given me
the wrong address.
But, Ma, he's hurt.
His horse ain't.
Ma. Ma, look.
Mr. Kehoe may be
leaving sooner
than he expected.
Go on. Get in the house.
Go on. Get a move on,
all of you.
Go on! Get!
Stay out of sight, mister.
MA: Get off my land,
Tom Larrabee.
Now, Ma,
we know he's there!
So send him out now,
so there won't be
no trouble!
Send who on out?
Are you sure, son?
Sure, I'm sure.
You know who, Ma!
That boy of yours!
Ain't no boy
of mine here.
Next time it won't
be your hat.
Where you goin',
mister?
Out there.
You give up easy?
It's a McDade
they're after.
LARRABEE: You can't
stop us this time, Ma.
So why don't you
call it quits before
somebody gets hurt.
Don't be a fool, mister.
You're courtin' a rope's end,
and you know it.
I got a chance.
You ladies haven't.
Hold your fire!
That's him.
That ain't no McDade.
Something I can do
for you boys?
What's your name?
What's yours?
What're you doin'
in Wagon Mound?
Resting.
Anybody here besides you?
Five lovely ladies.
Well, you just saddle up.
You're goin' back
into town with us.
What for?
Because I say so.
I don't know what business
you got in Wagon Mound,
but I ain't takin'
no chances on it
interferin' with mine.
You want McDade,
don't you?
I want him.
For how much?
The reward's
five thousand dollars.
Five thousand more
if we get back the loot.
You keep a lookout
posted hereabouts?
I ain't got enough men.
Willie here was chasin'
a stray horse
when he spotted you.
Then what's to prevent McDade
from checking in anytime,
collecting his loot,
and hightailin' it
out of here?
Nothin'.
Yes, there is. Me.
I'm a parlor border
in Wagon Mound.
When McDade shows,
I'll pass you the word.
You can pick him up
and the loot in
the same package.
How are you gonna
pass me the word?
You live close enough
to hear that church bell,
youngster?
We used to hear them.
All right.
The next time you hear it,
ride for the Sheriff here.
And ride along back
with him if you want
to see a dead McDade.
We'd sooner
have him alive.
But we'll take him
any way we can get him.
It's a deal.
MA: We're obliged
to you, mister.
Or the other way, ma'am.
You walked out that door,
I figured we'd seen
the last of you.
Your Sheriff can't handle
more than one idea at a time.
When he goes hunting
a McDade, he wouldn't
have a Kehoe at any price.
So I noticed. Tom Larrabee
ain't no fool, mister.
Why didn't he take you in?
Because I promised him
bigger game.
What game?
The loot.
And the man
he really came for.
My boy? By grab,
I wouldn't put it
past you.
He believe you?
Why shouldn't
he believe me?
There's a reward of
ten thousand dollars.
I've known men who'd sell
their mothers for less.
So have I.
Well, I reckon
we're quits, mister.
DAN: If you say so.
Better not ring that
church bell of yours.
That's the signal
I fixed up
with the Sheriff.
He'll come running
if he hears it.
You catch up your horse, and
get some supper inside you.
You'll want to
make tracks tonight.
You think I'm playing
the Sheriff's game?
No, I don't think that.
Then why not
let me hole up
here for a while,
till certain people
forget what I look like.
I'm a light eater,
and I'll lend a hand
with the chores.
We've done without you
for two years, mister.
I reckon we can
go on the same way.
Well, I guess
you got your reasons.
I got 'em.
Four of 'em.
DAN: One other thing.
When I go, my property
goes with me.
How much property
you claim to be missin'?
Not much, ma'am.
Not above
Ma.
You say
the Sheriff's
no fool.
Don't you think
it might occur to him to
post a lookout somewhere
to see that Mr. Kehoe
stays put?
Might.
Mr. Kehoe didn't
have to go out there
this afternoon.
They might have
shot him, Ma.
Do you think it's right to
make him run that risk
twice in the same day?
The rains are due
any day now.
Let him stay
till then.
He can get away
under cover of
the first big storm.
The rain will
wash out his tracks.
That suit you,
mister?
Suits me.
All right.
But I still got
four reasons for
wanting you off the place.
So, just you don't
give me another one.
Going to the spring?
I am.
Now, I always try to
recognize the courtesies,
Miss Sabina.
Like paying
a debt of gratitude.
You spoke up
for me today.
Thank you.
Better not let Ma
catch you around me.
If the old lady had
her way, you'd have
seen the last of me.
I thought that's
what you wanted.
When you went out
to the bridge today, you
were playing for a reprieve,
and I like to see a man
get his winnings.
Even when
you're the loser?
I'm not aware
I've lost anything,
Mr. Kehoe.
You might,
if I stay here
long enough.
In other words,
I spoke up for you because
I find you interesting.
Is that the case
you're trying to make?
It's a possibility.
Well, you're quite right.
When you walked up
to that Sheriff,
I was impressed.
So I decided to help you
stay around a few more days,
just to see
what'll happen next.
You'd better go now.
Ah, incidentally,
you do know where
it's hidden, don't you?
Even if I did,
a hundred thousand in gold
weighs a great deal,
Mr. Kehoe.
Now, I wouldn't be
able to do very much
about it, would I?
Oh, you could always
melt it down and use it
for brass knuckles.
We missed you at dinner,
Mr. Kehoe.
Still taking in
the sights?
That's right.
I'm a very curious
fellow, Miss Sabina.
Maybe you'll show me
around sometime.
Oh, I hardly think so.
 Oh, the Father
waits over the way
 To prepare us
a dwelling place there
 In the sweet
 By and by
 By and by
ALL:  We shall meet
on that beautiful shore

He's a mighty fine
melodeon player.
Hmm.
MA: I wished I'd knowed
what else he was,
besides sure trouble
in a house with four women.
You know a lot of tricks,
don't you, mister?
That's right.
Where'd you learn
how to play like that?
My pa was a preacher.
Had a tent show.
I used to travel
around with him.
Played the organ,
sang in the choir,
passed the collection box.
Hmm.
Your pa's preaching
don't seem to have took.
Nope.
Well, my boys was the same.
I raised 'em
best as I was able.
They knowed their Bible
as well as they knowed
their own names.
If they didn't,
they got the tar
licked out of them.
It didn't do no good.
They was bad.
Bad clear through.
I had to take
their part though,
even when they was
busting God's law
and everybody else's.
But I knowed what they was.
Like I reckon your pa
knowed what you was.
That's right.
There ain't much
I can do for them now.
What there is, I'm doing.
Them that's gone will
have a decent grave and
a decent stone to mark it.
The one that's left, well,
he'll have his rights.
After that,
I wash my hands.
It was the gold.
The gold was the
ruination of them all.
Myself, I wouldn't
want no part of it.
Look what it did
to my boys.
Look what it's doing
to them girls, turning
them against one another,
filling their heads full of
greed and evil notions.
Every one of them
lusting after that gold.
Oh, mister,
if it were mine,
I'd sink that gold
in the river and tell
Tom Larrabee to swim for it.
But you won't.
No, I won't.
Because I want to
see my boy again.
And I know
if he won't come back
for nothing or nobody,
he'll come back for that gold.
Mr. Kehoe.
DAN: Here I am.
I was looking for you.
Just wanted to assure myself
you were still out hunting.
Any luck?
Sure. I found all
that gold you were
so worried about,
sold it in Touchstone
and came back here rich to
take the woman of my choice.
Hmm.
Very fanciful,
Mr. Kehoe.
And how does
your taste run?
Oh, to just about
your shade of hair.
About so high,
waist about like this.
Then, I've got a chance.
Supposing your taste runs
to the right kind of man.
Well, I've had ample time
to think about men.
I'd say one about so high,
shoulders about like this.
But you didn't let me
finish, Mr. Kehoe.
I'd also like a man
I could trust.
You see, I expect to be
a rich woman very soon now.
Well, maybe
we could hasten
that day, Miss Sabina.
Maybe we could.
Except...
Except?
Except, I wouldn't trust you
with a snowball in a blizzard.
And I'm afraid
the only gold you're going
to leave here with
is what you brought
in your pockets.
Good night, Mr. Kehoe.
Don't you never
sleep,
Don't you?
Not when I got
things on my mind.
What kind of things?
Or maybe I shouldn't
have asked.
That's my husband's
shirt you're wearing.
I washed it for you.
Oh, thanks.
It's a nice shirt.
Yeah. Matt liked
things soft and nice.
I figured you might, too.
Did you come here to
talk about your husband?
No. I was a good wife
to him. That's all
I got to say.
Except that two years
is a long time.
I agree with you.
So will the other girls,
from what I hear.
All three of them
put together wouldn't make
as much woman as me.
Oh, I've had
a bellyful
of this life.
Them others can roost
here till they rot.
Me, I got other plans.
You want to
talk about 'em?
Yeah.
When you leave,
I'm leaving with you.
Hmm. And what will
your husband say to that?
I've got no husband.
You sure?
Sure.
He'd have come back.
He couldn't stay away
from me for two years.
Besides, he never ran
from a fight in his life,
and this was
a dandy fight
while it lasted.
No, don't worry
about Matt.
He's out there
in the burying ground,
and we ain't.
Well, not yet, anyway.
You're pretty clever,
I saw how you handled
the old woman.
If you're smart enough,
we'll be leaving here
in style.
Work on her.
She knows where
the loot is.
What about working
on one of the girls?
That Birdie?
Oh, them crows
don't know
no more than I do.
They're still here, ain't
they? Like me, waiting for
the dead to come alive.
No,
She's a hard case.
Pretty near bulletproof,
if you ask me.
She ain't man-proof.
No woman is.
A hundred thousand,
We'll be sitting
in a tub of butter.
We?
What's mine is yours.
Yeah. But right now
we're discussing money.
If Matt's dead,
you're out of the running.
Well, I'm Matt's widow.
I got a right to his share,
and anything else I can get.
And the old woman owes me
for every time I've felt
the flat of her hand.
I ain't waiting
much longer to collect.
But you're asking me
to do the collecting.
Yeah. That's right.
But I'm awful willing
to pay you wages for it.
Strike it rich, yet?
On a day like this,
who'd be thinking
of riches?
Oh, you've a beautiful
soul, Mr. Kehoe.
I can see
you're a nature lover.
Anybody's nature.
If I didn't know better,
I'd say that you were
acting like
a jealous woman,
Miss Sabina.
But you do know better.
I sure do,
and admire you for it.
You're the superior type.
No nonsense about
your sort of woman.
As long as you're
worried about that gold,
you're all business.
Yes, Miss Sabina,
you won't be much use
in any man's arms
until that loot shows up.
After that,
we might get to know
each other better.
"Never the less,
they did flatter him
with their mouth,
"and they lied unto him
with their tongues."
 From this valley
they say you are going
 We will miss your
bright eyes and sweet smile
 For you're taking
the sunshine with you
 That brightened
our hearts for a while 
My, that takes me back.
Prince and I
used to dance to that.
Where they off to?
To the spring.
We need water?
No.
That's what I figured.
Go on, Ruby,
catch up with them.
Go on, get!
Well, we're all set.
I remember
my mother doing that.
But her hair was gray,
and she only had enough
to make a braid so long.
I wonder where I'll be
when my hair is gray.
I know where
I'd like to be.
Where?
A million miles
from Wagon Mound.
It's none of my business,
Miss Oralie,
but how did a girl
like you wind up
with a McDade?
Roy was the first
person who ever made
a fuss over me.
I was just 16, and I didn't
believe that he was as bad
as everybody said.
I thought
he wanted me.
From what I hear,
he wanted
everything in sight.
Yes. Till he had it.
Well, you made
a bad draw, Miss Oralie,
but that's no reason
for quitting the game.
I don't know
what you mean.
You act like
your life is over.
You get yourself up
like an old lady.
Widow's weaves for a man
who wasn't worth
the powder to blow him up.
You know Wagon Mound isn't
the only town on the map.
Why don't you give
some other fellow
a chance?
Who'd want
Roy McDade's leavings?
What kept you so long?
Busted a trace.
Show me.
You sure ain't
much of a hand at
mending a harness.
Never said I was.
Looks like rain.
You figuring to be
cooking for him?
There's no sin in it.
There is if you got
a husband of your own.
My husband is dead.
You wished he was.
There ain't a one of you
ain't buried her husband
since that Dan Kehoe
set foot here.
The rotten lot of you,
burning for
the touch of him.
I'm sorry, Ma.
But everything's got
the look of evil to you.
There's no talking to you.
I want to know.
What happened out there?
Nothing.
Nothing?
He asked you
about the gold, too,
didn't he?
Well, what if he did?
He'll try his luck
with every one of you,
one way or another.
But there ain't
a one of you can tell
him where it's hid.
All right,
I'll tell you
what happened.
He was kind to me,
and he kissed me.
I'm not ashamed.
He's leaving here
this night,
and you should
pray to God
to forgive the wickedness
in your heart.
Now, go on.
Get out of my sight.
Pretty late
getting back,
You were a long time
at the spring.
Yeah. I was thirsty.
You find out anything
you didn't know?
I found out the McDade boys
had real different tastes
when it comes to women.
It wasn't that
good with Oralie,
was it, Dan?
I'd tell you, Ruby,
only we didn't
talk your language.
Well, then I'll tell you.
She was all sad
and innocent.
Only she'll rip
your heart out for
a pair of pearl earrings,
and then cry 'cause
they ain't diamonds.
She don't know
where the money is.
Do you?
I told you I don't.
Then that starts
you and Oralie off
kind of even.
You already made
your deal,
I tell you this,
you're my man,
and I don't share you
with nobody.
You're a charming girl, Ruby.
Only you wouldn't fight
for a man any more than
you'd fight for that gold.
You think I'm afraid?
I think
you want that money
so bad you can taste it.
For two years you've been
sitting around here,
waiting for someone
to waltz in
who'd do what you
haven't the guts to do,
face up to a tough old lady.
Now, she's in there,
and she knows where it is.
Go hunt it up.
Dan, you're not going?
The old lady says I am.
Oh, take me with you,
please, Dan.
Oh, take me
away from here.
You giving up
your share of the gold?
Ma'll never let it go.
She's driving herself
crazy in there,
hoarding it
for a dead man.
He'd come back
if he wasn't dead.
It's all she's got
to bet on, Oralie. There's
a real glory in the old lady.
She staked her whole
roll on those sons
and lost three times.
This is her last bet,
that her boy will come home.
But what about us, Dan?
Am I worth a bet?
I never put a dime
on anybody but myself,
and I haven't lost yet.
You ain't gonna
use that, are you?
He's getting out of here.
I'll drive him out.
I'm a fool to let him
stay here this long.
Kehoe! Kehoe!
Kehoe!
If she shoots him,
I hope she misses.
Hope she kills him.
Kehoe! Kehoe!
He's gone.
Lit out on his own.
That's what
you wanted,
wasn't it?
You shut your mouth.
Didn't he take anything?
Yes. Your good sense,
that's what he took.
What'd you have to
hate him for? He never
did nothing to you.
What about you, Sabina?
You don't hold no
grief for him, huh?
No, Ma.
Just disappointment.
I guess I never would've
gotten him, anyway.
But it sure was fun
thinking about it.
You're harlots.
The lot of you.
Good evening, ladies.
We were afraid you'd
run off, Mr. Kehoe.
Without our farewells
and best wishes.
What'd you come
back here for?
I never left.
Well, then you tell me
where you was.
You've got a right to ask,
so I'll tell you.
I was taking
a last look
for the gold.
Judas.
After the way
we hid you here.
Nobody chased me here, Ma.
I came here to rob you.
All of you.
You got a lot of nerve,
mister, telling me
a thing like that.
I got to hand it
to you, ma'am.
Wherever you hid that gold,
you sure did a good job.
I guess I could've
spent a whole year
and never found it,
unless I suddenly
got a lot smarter,
so I'll be riding out
the way I came in.
Maybe a little
ahead of the game,
for having known
all you lovely ladies.
Miss Birdie, don't you
ever stop dreaming
about the stage.
And keep those
pretty eyes bright,
so they'll always see
everything beautiful.
And maybe the meek
will inherit the earth,
Miss Oralie,
and a pretty girl
always has a good chance.
So, you should be
first in line
with a golden bucket.
Ruby, you're a danger
to the whole race of men,
but danger's always
a fair price to pay
for excitement.
It's been
a pleasure, ma'am.
And if your husband
happens to come back,
I'll envy him.
Ma, I'll always count myself
a winner for having known
a tough, old cougar
who knew how to
love her sons better
than they earned
and how to give a stranger
more than he deserved.
You're a rough,
old buzzard.
But you'll let me ride out
of here, because you'll
be thinking of your son,
and I'm not much better.
I hope he comes
back to you, Ma.
And I hope that each
of you get the man
you're praying for.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll go pack my things.
One day maybe
a smarter man than me
will ride by this way,
and relieve you
of that gold.
If that should happen,
don't feel too bad about it.
It didn't belong
to you anyway.
I've been expecting you.
You're leaving
without the gold?
What do you think?
Cards on the table,
Mr. Kehoe.
What are you holding?
Aces back to back.
I know who you are
and why you're here.
Who told you?
This told me.
Care to say
where you got it?
If I did,
you wouldn't believe me.
Cards on the table.
I got it
from a barkeep
in Touchstone.
I think not, Mr. Kehoe.
I think this gold piece
was given to you
by its original owner.
I think he sent you
here to collect the
hundred thousand for him,
only you decided
to deal him out.
I see. You got it
all figured out.
I'm willing to split
the gold with you,
half and half.
Fine.
It's a deal?
It's a deal.
There's only one hitch.
I don't know
where the gold is.
I do.
How?
I've been here two years,
Mr. Kehoe.
What kept you
from cashing in?
I needed a man
with a strong arm
to help me.
Half and half?
Half and half.
Miss Sabina,
you're a woman
after my own heart.
Tougher than whang leather,
smarter than spit,
and colder than January.
You've described me
correctly, Mr. Kehoe.
Tough enough
to make my own way
in a man's world,
smart enough to scheme
my way into the affections
of a lonesome old woman,
and cold enough
to sell her out
and sleep sound on it.
We're two of a kind,
Mr. Kehoe.
Thank you. I'm in.
Where to?
Ride out of here now.
When everything's dark,
come back,
hitch up the buckboard,
take it across the bridge
and hide it there.
When it's safe,
I'll meet you.
Whoa, son. Whoa.
Whoa, boy.
Ma, he's on his way.
Anybody see you?
No. Nobody.
When it comes to thieving,
there's nothing like
experienced help.
Come on.
I'll show you
where it is.
You sure you can?
Quite sure.
I wouldn't bet
any money on it.
You know,
that gold just walked right up
and whispered into my ear.
Why, you knew!
All the time
you were telling us
your fine speech.
Well, I always believe
in giving value received.
Well, you got what you
came for. You didn't have
to share it with anybody.
Why are you
waiting here for me?
Ah, there's no point in
winning just for the game.
Not when you're alone.
It could have been
one of the others.
Not for fifty thousand
dollars worth.
So, you paid your money
and took your choice.
Why not? You offered
me half, didn't you?
Now you're talking
like an honest man.
They say that's the kind
you can't cheat.
Ma! Hey, Ma!
Sabina ain't
in her room.
She's gone,
I tell you.
Dirty, thieving rat!
It's been there
all the time.
And they won't keep it,
I promise them that.
That blame Kehoe
has laid his own trap.
DAN: How does it
feel to be rich?
You ought to know.
Yeah. I got it all.
The pick of the litter and
all the gold in the world.
What's so funny?
If that last McDade turns
out to be your husband,
he'll be after me
like a storm of wildcats.
Boone was the one
who escaped,
but he won't be coming
after you. He's dead.
And he wasn't my husband.
The closest I ever came to
marrying Boone was watching
him get drunk once in Denver,
the night before
he was killed.
He told me about the gold,
so I went after it.
Passed myself off
as married to him.
The truth?
The truth.
We're a pair
of beauties,
aren't we, Dan?
How'd you find out
where the gold was?
I watched Ma
when she went out
to check it. You?
The same.
Except I had to wait
for the right man,
and in walked
Dan Kehoe.
The old fox.
She's still trying to win.
Whoa!
What are you doing?
Another few minutes,
and they'll be
sitting in our laps.
A reasonable man
always settles
for a half, a quarter,
or whatever he can get.
Have you gone crazy?
Here, this one is ours.
You know where the mission
is outside Las Piedras?
I'll find it.
Take that to the priest,
tell him to put it
with the rest of my money.
I'll meet you there later.
All right.
Morning. Sure glad
to see you gentlemen.
LARRABEE: You just
keep your hand clear
of that gun belt.
There's the loot, Sheriff.
All accounted for.
We'll see about that.
I figured we had a McDade.
Who rang that bell?
I did.
You did?
Yeah. I found the gold
and set out to return the
same to the rightful owner.
People being what
they are these days,
I figured it wasn't safe
carrying all that loot
without a proper escort.
So, I rang the bell
for help, and you
gentlemen did your duty.
I thank you.
Well, if you wanted
us so bad, why did
you run so fast?
Yeah, well now, Sheriff,
you might have noticed that
I was traveling with a lady.
It turned out she was
more interested in the gold
than she was in me,
so she pulled a gun
and tried to make me
run for it.
It took a lot of fast
talking to make her see
the right way of things.
One of them
McDade widows.
Which one was it?
Now, Sheriff, you know
a man of honor can't answer
a question like that.
Sheriff,
five thousand
is missing.
Yeah. My property, sir.
Legal reward for
returning the gold.
Oh, I reckon he's right.
Hey, Sheriff, you know,
about those McDade women...
You know, it takes a man
like you and me
to understand them.
Driven half wild
with greed and loneliness,
the poor souls,
they need all the charity
we can give them.
Well, it's been
a pleasure to do business
with an honest man.
Well, thank you.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Well, now there's a
real fine gentleman.
You don't meet them
like that no more.
All right, let's load up the gold.
Come on.
All the saints in heaven!
Can this be a miracle, my son?
She came to tell me
you'd been hanged.
Who told you?
Your lovely wife. Her,
with the flaming red hair.
My wife?
She claimed to be.
She showed me
the wedding ring
when she came
for your possessions.
You didn't give her my money?
Yes. Every cent of it.
Oh, me poor frazzled brain.
Where did she go?
What a bundle
of tricks she was,
now that I think of it.
She said she was going
to Albuquerque,
but she tore off
like a wild hare
to the border.
Hey, Kehoe!
Here's your cash, partner.
That's right generous
of you.
You know, for a while there,
Miss Sabina, I almost
took you for a crook.
You've got
a suspicious mind.
Well, you had the money,
what did you wait for?
Like a fella said once,
"There's no fun just winning
the game when you're alone."
Oh, I see. You figure
we'd be fit company
for each other?
Haven't I proved that, Mr. Kehoe?
Get in?
This will be a rare education.
