-
Everyone go into the woods!
-
Fall back!
- You okay?
- Come on, Bob.
Bring him over that way.
- Captain, you all right?
- Get down!
- Goddamn it, Cole!
This stopped being fun
about two years ago!
- Down!
- Fire!
- Cole, Bob, you boys okay?
- Yeah.
Take more than a cannon to kill
the Younger brothers, sir!
I think the cannon's doing
a pretty good job, Cole!
Some Indian tracker
ou turned out to be, Tom.
You paid me to find your Bluecoats.
There they are.
- Get me theJames boy.
- You wantJesse?
No, notJesse.
I want the one that can shoot.
Frank!
- Frank, up front!
Jesse, watch your back.
- Cannon or Gatling?
- Fire!
- Cannon!
- Cannons.
Where you been, buddy?
- What's goin' on?
- Well, nothin' really.
Every time I put my head up
to hit that Gatling,
they try and shoot it off.
- So we got a plan?
- My plan of pissin' myself
seems to be workin' fine!
Listen, I can hit those boys from here.
We just need a distraction.
- A distraction?
Well, why the hell
didn't you just say so?
- He's smilin'.
- That's never a good thing.
-
- Get that rider!
Take the hill!
Charge!
Fall back!
Go!
-
Go on, git. Git!
- Go on! Go on!
-
Yee-haw!
- Distracting enough for you?
- They hardly even noticed you.
- You're saying I could have done
more to attract their attention.
- Uh-huh.
- Such as?
- You could've worn one of those
floppy women's Easter bonnets.
- That would've made an impression.
- I figure.
See, that's your problem, Frank.
By the time you finish
figurin' out stuff,
No, your problem is you're doin' stuff
before I'm finished figuring it out.
Goddamn, boy!
Wait till we get back
to Missouri.
Tell all them little gals 'bout
how littleJesseJames charged
the whole Union army by hisself.
Well, but I'll still be
better-looking, won't I?
See if we can't get those Yankees
Jesse here scared off. Yaah!
- Ride with me, cousin.
- I could use the walk.
All right. Suit yourself.
We'll have some horses
waitin' for you at the road.
All right, Rangers.
Let's ride!
Now, I would sound just stupid
saying something like that. Hyah!
- Where you boys going?
- There's Yankees back there.
- The war's over, son.
General Lee surrendered
esterday at Appomattox.
Yesterday.
Well, somebody better
go tell the damn Yankees.
- What do you reckon, cousin?
- Home.
Cole, we go home,
and we ride like hell to get there.
Now, that's the best damn plan
I heard all war.
Well, boys, let's ride!
- Hello, Liberty, Missouri.
Let's go home,
back to our farms.
Plantin' corn,
harvestin' corn and eatin' corn.
- Corn gonna shoot at me?
- Then I love it.
- Let's go.
- We got problems.
- We're in occupied territory, boys.
- Hands off your hip, Cole.
- You ain't scared, are you, Jesse?
- Pick your fights, cousin.
- Jesus, mercy.
- That's Charlie Higgins.
- I'm cuttin' him down.
- Not now, Cole.
What in the hell
is wrong with you?
In case we have to kill
these son of a bitches,
I don't want 'em to see us comin'.
I want to get back to the farm
and make sure LittleJim
and the girls are okay.
Yeah, and stop by our spread after that
and tell our ma we're all right.
We'll go see Doc Mimms.
Excuse me, sir.
We're here for the doctor.
Jesse. Frank!
Zerelda?
Little Zee Mimms?
You were littleJesseJames
when you left!
Yeah, but you got big.
- Frank, will you
say something, please?
- No, you're doing just fine.
- Frank? Jesse?
- Daddy!
Where's Web?
He rode right into 'em,
screamin' like a banshee.
My little Web did that?
He jumped his horse
clear over our heads and
killed a dozen Union soldiers...
Took out the Gatling gun
and the cannon all by himself.
Saved all our lives, Doc.
None of the Liberty boys
would have come home
if not for Web Mimms.
- God's honest truth.
- Web died fighting?
Web died a hero.
But still died.
Look, Doc, if there's
anything we can do for you,
- Start thinking about yourselves.
Don't end up
like Charlie Higgins.
They found out Charlie rode
with Quantrill's Raiders.
They arrested him,
tried him by military tribunal
and hanged him this morning.
- I thought there was a general amnesty.
- For soldiers, yes.
But if you rode in
one of the partisan bands,
they'll hang you for treason.
You boys are in more danger
'cause you've got a farm.
During the war, all we thought about
was coming home.
If I have to go to war
with the railroad to stay,
that's fine by me.
If we have a good story
and we stick to it,
we should be all right.
What story are they
gonna believe, Frank?
until, say, Sharpsburg,
where you were reassigned
to General Stuart's cavalry...
until you surrendered
in Tennessee.
That... just might work.
She'll be glad
to see her sons alive.
Zee.
Thank you for everything.
- Especially that story
that you told my father.
- Look, Zee...
I'm goin' to go cry now.
- That Zerelda turned into
a hell of a woman, eh?
- Oh, yeah.
- "Big and older"?
- You can shut up now, Frank.
- You are a charmer.
- I swear to God I will
shoot you in your sleep.
Next time try
"fat and haggard."
My boys? My boys!
My boys! My boys are alive!
Oh, God!
Praise God!
- You're alive!
- Not if you don't ease up a bit, Ma.
- Oh!
- Oh, Ma.
- Did you kill Yankees?
- A fair number, Ma.
- And did you say your prayers?
- Every night, Ma.
Good. Now, come on inside
and wash your hands for dinner.
- You look so good.
- You look great!
Whoo!
Howdy, boys.
Look atJimmy Younger, all grown up.
- How ya doin'?
- All right.
- Your ma wouldn't let us leave
until we ate somethin'.
- That was two hours ago.
- I don't see clean plates.
- Glad to see you being so nice
to our Indian friend.
And Jesus told me that made him
an all-right boy.
Well, she's still
talkin' toJesus.
- What worries me is
thatJesus is talkin' back.
- I heard that.
- You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
- Yeah.
Yeah, she got two
of'em, don't she?
- I think one of them's glass.
- Is that the right one
or the left one?
- The brown one.
Cole, don't make me tell
the whole town about that time
ou screwed that fella in Atlanta.
- Ooh.
- You talkin' to me?
- You mean that
dance hall girl at Bunny's?
- Yeah.
Sadie was a beautiful woman.
Sadie was not a man.
- She had a nice mustache.
- I think she had more
than a moustache.
- Ah, all right.
I'll admit Sadie was a woman if you
just stop sayin' things about my Zee.
- "My Zee"?
- Your Zee?
- Yeah.
From women's eyes
this doctrine I derive:
They sparkle still,
They are the books,
the arts, the academes...
that show, contain
and nourish all the world.
Well, I don't know
what it is you just said,
but it sounded real nice.
That's Shakespeare.
Now, he's European.
Wanna write that down for me, Frank,
so I can say it to Zee?
- Yeah, I'll send you a telegram.
- Thanks, brother.
Thanks for the help, Cole.
You did plenty
over at our place.
You miss it, don't you?
There are things
I miss about it, but...
- It was exciting.
- Yeah.
But it was a whole lot of killing,
and why should we miss that?
Shoot,
we were great at it.
Don't tell anybody
I said this.
I'm gonna have to kill you
'cause everybody knows
I'm the toughest man in town.
But you are one terrifying
son of a bitch with them guns.
Yeah, well.
Boys.
- Howdy, folks.
How are you today?
- Howdy.
- Yeah, Easterners.
- We're just fine, thank you, sir.
I'm Rollin H. Parker,
personal emissary to Mr. Thaddeus Rains,
president of the Rock
Northern Railroad.
And this gentleman
is the famous Allan Pinkerton,
As you no doubt heard
from your neighbors,
our railroad is moving west.
Moving west opened up the frontier
to folks such as yourselves.
It so happens that your acreage here is
located on the proposed right of way.
I am here
to get your signature...
on this land sale contract.
And I'm authorized
to pay you...
two dollars an acre.
- Two dollars?
That's the price approved
by the Department of Interior
of the United States of America.
This land ain't for sale.
Ma'am, I can understand how you feel.
You've made a lovely home here,
but it really isn't up to me or you.
You familiar with the legal concept,
the right of eminent domain?
Yeah, I am.
What about it?
This land's about
to be condemned.
Good day, Mr. Parker.
You can tell Mr. Thaddeus Rains
to put this where the sun don't shine.
Shakespeare.
I don't think you understand.
- You don't have a choice.
-
Ma'am, I think that you
should search your heart here...
Let me ask the Lord.
The Lord says we can bury 'em
out back in the orchard.
Nobody'll ever find 'em.
- Somebody's in a vengeful mood today.
- Let 'em go for today, Ma.
- We'll bury 'em out back next time.
Now, ma'am...
You folks are making
a serious mistake here.
Nicely played.
Tell all the folks
what you told me, Frank.
I went to the courthouse
to look at the right-of-way
documents for the rail bed.
The railroad doesn't
even need our land.
They're just using our land
on both sides for as far as they can.
Floor recognizes
Clell Miller.
They're sayin' if we don't sell,
we might end up with nothing.
- That's only if we
don't stick together.
- Loni Packwood.
I say this is the last straw.
I came back from the war.
My farm was burned down.
My cows was dead.
That son of a bitch.
He took my dog.
- He took my dog!
- They got Cole!
You all want to hear this.
They came up, they made the same offer
they made you folks.
One of the detectives hit him
in the head and knocked him out.
- Oh, no.
- He lost his temper a little.
- How many of them did he kill?
- Two.
- Cole.
The army can hang him.
- Tomorrow.
Nothin'.
You folks are gonna do nothin'.
You're gonna go home right now.
So you can swear on a Bible
ou don't know anything about
what's gonna happen tomorrow.
- Boys...
- Doc!
Go home.
They ain't gonna hang
no more Liberty boys.
Go home.
Meeting's adjourned.
Go home, everybody.
Go home.
- I'm staying.
- Me too.
Loni, Clell.
- I couldn't lose him.
- Ah, Jim Younger!
- I told you to stay home!
- It's my fault they're
gonna kill Cole. I want in.
It was a matter of time before
they tried to hang somebody else
to scare off the other farmers.
- And you're too young.
- Too young?
I'm the same age you were
when you went to war.
Yeah, and the same age
Web was. No.
Who else was there when
they hanged the others?
You need to know how they do it,
which way they walk up,
what order they
do things in.
then damn you all.
All right.
Eight of us...
- He's smilin'.
- Is that bad?
Very.
Pinkerton, relax.
- The army has everything well in hand.
- Hmm.
Nothin' like a hanging to motivate
the population to relocate.
It's not my job to relax.
I've got men positioned
at every entrance to this square,
so no one will
ride in shooting.
And I've got a sharpshooter
up on that rooftop over there.
Just in case.
May God have mercy
on his soul.
-
-
Brilliant.
Hang him!
Pull it! Pull it!
Sir, are you all right?
Somebody get a doctor.
The bullet came out clean,
but he's lost an awful lot of blood.
He's gonna be fine,
right, Daddy?
Praying wouldn't hurt.
- Who's that?
Stay here with him.
We're looking for a fugitive.
We're checking all the houses
in the area.
- I'm goin' up.
- Sir, who are you?
- Oh, sorry, ma'am.
- Well, I should hope so!
Go! Go.
Jesse, are you awake?
- Jesse, is that your hand?
- Mmm.
They're gone.
- What are you...
- I fooled them into thinking
I was alone.
Let's hope the boy
pulls through.
I think he's
feeling better already.
- Well, I'm pleased to be here.
- Really?
No, Parker, no. I'm really not
pleased to leave my boardroom,
in the name of all that's holy,
ou can't seem to evict
a few simple farmers...
from their pathetic
little mud holes...
so I can build the greatest railroad
the world has ever seen.
Well, I completely understand
our distress, sir.
What's going on?
Well, sir, two weeks ago
we managed to have the army
hang one of the local farmers.
- That's good.
- No, unfortunately not, sir.
Uh, a group of local thugs managed
to rescue him from the gallows.
Not only did this inspire resistance
in the other farmers,
Leaving you in charge of operations
until he should return.
A further impediment is that
the army garrison has been ordered
to move on away from Liberty,
I see a power vacuum
to be filled.
As we have the most power,
we may move with impunity.
I see, sir.
I'll get together four patrols of
our detectives for action tonight.
We'll teach these Podunks
what happens when they challenge
the righteousness of progress.
Yes, sir.
- Jesse, you shouldn't be up.
- I've been on my back two weeks, Zee.
- I'm sick of it.
- You sick of my company?
No, 'course not, Zee.
Teasing you's
completely unfair.
What you do to me
is unfair.
- I shouldn't tease a hero.
- A what?
Everybody in the county knows
it was you who rescued Cole.
We're all so proud of you, Jesse.
Not a single farm's been
sold to the railroad since.
Oh, that's good.
But I wasn't the only person
risking my neck that day, so...
So you're saying that I should go
spend time with Cole Younger?
With Cole Younger?
No, I never said that.
Whoa!
You gonna stop loafin' around
with that young lady...
- What do you think, Frank?
You get in the wagon!
Until Ma has you home
so she can fuss over you herself,
she's gonna make me miserable.
- What do you say, sir?
- Go ahead. You're pretty much
all healed up.
- Thank you, Doc.
- Of course.
Bye, Jesse.
- Bye, Zee.
-
- You're lookin' a bit more spry.
- Shut up, Frank.
Doc? I was wonderin' if, uh,
later this evenin' I could come by.
You're always
welcome here, Jess.
I know, but I was thinkin' maybe
I could come by and take Zee out.
You know, someplace near,
with other folk.
Near, you know, here, but...
out.
That's fine by me, Jesse.
Oh, don't worry, sir.
I'll make sure they're
properly chaperoned.
I am deeply in your debt.
Well, you are
very welcome, sir.
The army's leaving town, so Cole
can stop hidin' up in the woods
and get back to his farm.
We're all gonna meet
at the Younger place for a shindig.
- Cole.
- Clell.
- How are ya?
- Hey, John.
- Good to see you. Thanks for comin'.
- How are ya?
- Hey, Cole Younger.
Who's seen Loni Packwood,
how he's dressed? Look at that!
Tom.
Come here, huh?
- Thank you.
- You behave yourselves, you hear?
- Liberty's favorite son. Come here!
- Hi, Cole.
I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
You know it?
- Zee, I'm pleased you came.
- Why, thank you, Bob.
I'm especially pleased
ou came with Jesse,
seeing as right now there's
a gaggle of girls hopin'
to dance with Jesse...
- Bob, you have no shame.
- Not yet, but I'm hopin'.
- Come on, let's dance.
- Okay.
Yo!
I used to come to this rock
all the time when I was a kid.
Just imaginin' what my life
would be like when I got older.
- You didn't want a farm?
- Uh-uh.
I was thinkin' more along the lines
of being a river pirate.
- A river pirate?
- Yeah. Argh, hand over
our jewels, missy!
Well, thank God
ou grew out of that.
You did grow out of that,
didn't you?
Mostly, yeah. It would be
an all-right life for a bachelor.
A-Are you plannin' on bein'
a bachelor your whole life,
JesseJames?
Not if I find the right girl.
What's this right girl like?
What's she like?
She's, uh, she's smart.
She's funny.
She's bossy.
She always makes me think
she's at least two steps ahead of me.
Where will you find such a girl?
-
From this doctrine...
Damn.
From women's eyes these doctrine...
this doctrine I derive:
They sparkle...
still, like...
tiny... sparkling rocks.
- Darn it.
- Sparkling rocks?
Yeah, little ones, see.
Yes, it is.
Were, um... Were you planning on
kissing me when you finished quoting?
Been planning on kissing you
for a very long time.
Bastards!
Come back here and face me!
- Cole, what'd they do?
Let's get back.
We need some water.
Let's get some buckets.
- Get buckets!
- Water!
- Frank.
- It's the Pinkertons.
It's the railroad.
Then Ma... Ma!
Come on!
Huh! Hyah! Hyah!
Thank God.
Ma!
Ma! Ma!
Hang on, Ma.
We gotta get you to Doc Mimms.
You boys... take care...
take care of each other.
- Ma, Doc Mimms...
- Shh!
Well, look at that.
The good Lord's a bit shorter
than I reckoned.
Ma.
I think we can move on,
rebuild,
make a decent life
someplace else.
I don't care.
I didn't think you would.
Our place, Clell Miller's,
SammyJohnston, the Creeders, Will Hite.
I say we ride into town and kill us
some Pinkertons and railroad men.
No. This isn't a feud. This is war.
They've got more men than we do.
So what do we do,
General Lee?
We do what we did
in the war.
We harass their supply lines.
We try and kill the railroad's men,
they won't care.
- Exactly.
- That's a good plan, Jesse.
See if she can't get me a list of towns
where the railroad's keepin' its money.
I'm so sorry, Jesse.
Me and Frank have to
go away for a while.
But you and I,
we've started something, you know?
I don't know what'll happen
if you do this.
- Neither do I.
- Just let the law...
Laws don't touch men like
Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Whose justice,
ours or God's?
When I send them
to their graves.
- Hyah, hyah!
- Yah!
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
I have bad news.
- The railroad payroll has been stolen.
The railroad's money
is right there in that safe.
- That safe?
Excuse me, sir.
- The bank's closed today.
- What?
- Bank holiday.
- There ain't no dadburned
bank holiday!
- Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!
- Ow! Hey!
This is outrageous.
Who are you people?
TheJames Gang.
- TheJames Gang?
- Yeah.
How 'bout the, uh,
James-Younger Gang?
TheJames-Younger Gang.
- I'll whop you real good now
if you don't get out...
Excuse me, sir?
It's a bank holiday.
Ain't no dadburned bank holiday!
What are you talkin' about?
- Mister! What the hell
are you doing, mister?
- Go on!
- Do me a favor.
Turn around, cover your eyes.
- Why?
I'm gonna shoot this man.
I don't think you want to see it.
Thank you.
Hey. The safe.
Now!
- It's a bank holiday!
- It ain't!
- You're right, sir.
Well, then why can't I
go in there?
On account of that we're,
uh, robbing it.
- It's a secret.
- Oh!
Fine.
Uh, I'll just wait over here.
I'd appreciate that.
Go on!
Get outta here.
- What the...
- What is it?
Old Man Tucker is just sittin' there
quiet outside the bank.
- So when have you ever known
Old Man Tucker...
not to be yellin'
at everybody?
- How'd it go in there?
- Fine. How'd it go out here?
I think we should talk.
Hyah. Hyah, hyah!
Hyah!
Sir, you can do this
the smart way or the stupid way.
Only one way ends
with you still breathin'.
Just 'cause we're
robbin' a bank,
- there's no reason not
to be civil about it.
- Mm-hmm.
Where the hell were you?
I had you covered.
- I got 5,000.
- I got three.
- Eight thousand dollars!
That's a thousand apiece!
-
Our luck
is finally changing.
What do we do with these?
These are the property rights
to the farms that the bank
was holdin' for the railroad.
You better pass them over here
before somethin' happens to 'em.
- Whoops.
-
All right.
Settle down.
Not all this money's ours.
See, that's why we had to go
to all the trouble of stealing it.
- Lot of people hurtin' there.
- None of them risked
their necks for this.
Let's think about this.
We create goodwill
with the folk hereabout,
make it easier to dodge the law.
- Frank's being smart about this.
Just because he reads them books
and knows all them big words
don't make him smart.
- Uh, yeah, it does.
- No, it don't, Bob. Stay out of this.
- I thinkJesse's got a good idea.
- Jim?
Who put you in charge
of this gang, Jesse, huh?
- I did a mighty fine job
leadin' us durin' the war.
- You did, Cole.
I seem to remember
cuttin' a noose from your neck.
That's why you both
lead the gang.
AllJesse's doin'
is makin' a suggestion.
That's fine.
- I reckon it's a smart thing to do.
- Cole!
- Hey, that's it.
We decide somethin',
that's it.
Now, we're in this
for the long haul,
and this plan
of me and Jesse's...
We got to think...
What's that word, Frank?
"Strategically."
Yeah. Thank you.
Strategically.
- 'Cause this is a war.
- This ain't no war.
What's that?
Nobody paid me no thousand dollars
to fight in a war.
- One down.
- Damn it, Tom. You cheatin' again?
- I'm broke again.
- Yeah, see, that ain't a bank, Jesse.
- It's better.
It's a construction depot,
so it'll have the strongbox,
some ammo, explosives.
We can take those.
That way we can do
a bigger job next time.
And it's guarded
by Pinkerton detectives.
And I do so want to kill me
some Pinkerton detectives.
Boys!
We're famous.
What's this?
"The Fidelity Bank
was robbed on Tuesday by a gang
of 20 heavily armed men."
Twenty?
What are the odds?
Another gang
robbin' the same bank
on the same day as us.
"shot their way out of town,
wounding the sheriff...
The bank officials estimate
the loss of $50,000."
Fifty thousand dollars?
More like fifty thousand pesos.
"U.S. District marshal called
this the first daylight bank
robbery in American history."
- Here's to history.
- I'll drink to that.
We made history?
That is something to be proud of.
Yeah, the rest of that's
a bunch of horseshit.
That means next time we're gonna have
to set the record straight ourselves.
Then they raided the payroll office
and blew the track.
How much did they get
from the safe?
Thirty-five thousand, sir,
in coins and currency,
not to mention the added delay
of miles of destroyed track.
I'll kill 'em
for blowing up my railway.
Then who did?
- Whoa!
- We did.
I mean, our men... did.
My professional opinion...
is that you've managed
to piss off the wrong bunch
of farm boys this time.
- They had to be dealt with.
- By burning down their homes?
You wouldn't
have done that?
Oh, I'd have done that,
all right, but I'd have made
sure I killed 'em all first.
I want them arrested
and hanged.
Do you think a jury in these parts
would convict one of their own?
Uh-uh. I doubt it.
We're beginning a very interesting
game here, Mr. Rains.
This is no game.
Well, I'm afraid
our adversaries...
don't agree.
"Rock Island Pacific
Railroad Depot was robbed...
"just outside
of St. Louis, Missouri.
"The brave and daring
James-Younger Gang...
"was heavily outnumbered
by Pinkerton detectives,
but the city lawmen were no match
for the guns of the West."
Fine piece of writin'.
"The gang destroyed
the Thaxton Switch construction,
"meaning that, for a few months,
honest farmers will be able to sleep...
without fearing the railroad
is coming to steal their land."
Who wrote this?
I'll see 'em hanged
every Tuesday for a month.
Oh, that's the best part.
"Foregoing article
was sent to this newspaper,
was reputedly written...
by the outlaw
JesseJames himself."
- Hey, look at that!
- What is it?
ahead."
Whoo! Yes, sir!
That was a fine
piece of driving.
Damn!
- Good day to you, sir.
- Good afternoon, sir.
Could you change this for me?
- Certainly, sir.
- Thank you.
Sir, I'm sorry, but
this bill is counterfeit.
- I don't think so.
-
I'm gonna have to see
the rest of your money
so I can compare.
It's a scientific method.
- I hear it's all the rage.
- Uh-huh.
- James.
- JesseJames?
- Yes, sir.
It's a terrible sketch.
-
- That's all I have, sir.
- Why, thank you.
It's been a pleasure.
- Yes, sir.
- Take care now, you hear?
- Good-bye, sir.
Have a good day.
- Good-bye.
Pinkerton, why can't you catch
these outlaws?
It's early in the game yet, sir.
JesseJames and I are just
learning each other's moves,
feeling out
each other's patterns.
Oh. Well, I'm losing
millions of dollars
and months of time...
- while you play chess
with these farmers.
- Hardly farmers, sir.
So what can you tell me?
It's going to be
a long winter.
Yaah! Yaah-aah-aah!
- Yaah! Yaah!
- Let's go!
Take this road.
Come on!
Hyah!
Come on, boys!
Come on!
Go, go!
Hyah! Hyah!
Whew! Never thought
that posse was gonna give up.
Yeah, they were
admirably persistent.
That's the longest chase
we've had.
- Jesse, we've gotta have a word.
- Sure, cousin.
All the newspapers
are calling this bunch
theJames-Younger Gang.
- Right?
- Yeah.
Why the hell aren't we
the Younger-James Gang?
We got three Younger brothers
and twoJames brothers.
I like the sound
of theJames-Younger Gang.
Jim, I'll beat the piss
out of you right now.
Stay out of this.
- How's that, Bob?
Say we burst into a bank, and we yell,
"We're the Younger-James Gang!"
People are gonna be thinkin',
"The youngerJames gang?
So people tryin' to figure that out
instead of raisin' their arms.
- Can't argue with that, Cole.
- Do we even have the same mama? Huh?
If I kill you, then I killJim,
I'm gonna have no arguments.
Pinkerton?
It's been eight months.
I don't see men
on the end of nooses.
Most of theseJames Gang's encounters
have been with local law enforcement.
Quite frankly are no match
for this gang's cunning.
- What about your detectives?
- Listen, you!
Shut up.
I have to hunt this man.
I have to get inside
this man's mind.
I have to anticipate him.
- And that takes time.
- Time, time, time.
I can't believe this.
Would you believe there are
certain towns in Missouri...
where theJames Gang
walks openly in the street...
- #Was blind #
- That's my money.
- Well, sir, we should burn
that school to the ground.
That's the way to win' em
back to our side.
but they did their jobs.
Do your job.
Then you let me do my job
as I see fit,
without interference.
- What can you tell me?
- It's going to be a long spring.
If people would just hand over
their money and not shoot at us,
there'd be a lot less killing.
- What's that?
- It's my lucky rabbit's foot.
Took it off
that dead fellow over there.
- I don't think
that one's working, Loni.
- What?
- Can I have your autograph?
-
-
Take us to the West.
Lane, Grogan, you take this.
You take these towns.
You remind me of...
Here, write this.
I'm not writing this.
Your blue-green eyes remind me of...
- Remind me of that land in the sky.
- The land in the sky.
That "even here."
You might want to change that
to, uh, "I thought of you."
Ah, look, just write
the whole thing yourself. L...
Okay, sir, I think we know
how this is gonna go.
- One false move
and I'll blow your head off!
-
- Bob?
- You heard me, Jesse!
You know how crazy I get!
Crazy!
Bob.
- We got a problem, little brother?
- Frankly, yeah.
- I'm feelin' a little... left out.
- Oh!
- This is about
the wanted posters, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Obviously someone's not standin' out
in people's minds at the robberies.
Gents, we're in the middle
of somethin' here.
- Yeah, Bob's upset.
- The posters?
- Yeah.
- Don't say "yeah"
in that tone of voice!
- This is important!
-  Okay.
Pardon the delay, folks,
but we had to get...
Yeah.  Bob
here'll kill a man for sneezin'.
He's the best shot in the gang.
how 'bout we get back
to the robbery?
That means now, mister!
Now.
- Oh!
- Damn, Loni, you're lucky.
Luckiest man in the West...
now that I'm ridin' with JesseJames.
- You okay, Jesse?
- Drinkin' whiskey, Jim?
You're too young
to be drinkin' whiskey.
Not too young to shoot a man,
not too young to drink whiskey.
Ahh!
Jim, you, uh,
been with a girl yet?
Tonight?
Why, I was just gettin' ready
to go turn on that Younger charm.
- Well, not exactly.
- You been with a girl ever?
Hell, yeah,
I've been with a girl!
Look, I didn't want to get
one of them paid ladies.
- You know what I mean?
- I think so.
I mean, you, Frank,
Cole, even Bob,
ou get all the girls 'cause
ou're good-lookin' and famous.
They just look at me
like I'm your baby brother.
- Don't tell nobody.
- I swear. Not a word.
- You okay?
- Tell you what...
Uh! I can't
drink good neither.
- I'm gonna go outside
and throw up. Uhh!
- You do that. Hurry.
Hmm! Hey, Loni.
- Oh, yeah!
- Mm!
Let's go, sugar britches.
Just call me "Lucky" Loni Packwood.
- Parker?
- Yes, sir?
- What's that?
- That, sir?
- Sir!
- Jenkins.
Yes, well, uh,
we have
done a financial study...
- of the construction costs projecting...
- Jenkins!
It's... cheaper to go around
JesseJames, sir.
it's-it's just... cheaper.
So... you are telling me...
thatJesseJames has won?
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
to the vicinity
of Liberty, Missouri,
- and they always pull a job
before they return.
- So?
So there's only four banks within
that travel radius they've not robbed.
Could you put men
at all four?
I don't have to.
I've a much better tool at my disposal
for narrowing it down to one bank.
- What's that?
- An intense hatred of you.
Jesse.
Things a fella's gotta do to get
a little respect around here.
- Finally. You deserve it, Bob.
It's about time.
- Thank you.
Listen, Jesse, um...
we got a problem.
It's Cole.
Ah, he's been
full of vinegar lately.
- He's plannin' a job.
- He's what?
- Look, he's my brother,
and I don't wanna start trouble.
- Tell me.
- Cole, are you sure?
- Tell you what, boys.
- What will be?
Hyperion Bank.
Two days ride from Liberty.
- That's in the paper, huh?
- Don't sound right.
- If you read about it first,
ou'd have no problems.
What are you saying, Cole?
Jesse, I've robbed
just as many banks as you have.
I know this town, I know this bank,
and I say it's an easy job.
- I think you're forgettin'
who's in charge.
- Jesse.
You're in charge? Huh?
We ain't partners no more, Jesse?
Let me get this straight.
You tell Cole Younger
when and where to ride?
- Cole, he didn't mean that.
- You're takin' sides
against me now, Frank?
- No.
We don't wanna do that.
No.
None of us poor idiots wanna
go up againstJesseJames.
Greatest outlaw
who ever lived.
That's what it says
in the paper.
Weren't for you,
this gang wouldn't be able to
find a goat's ass with a stick.
You have gotten mighty full
of yourself lately, Jesse.
You think so?
You all do?
Frank?
- A bad idea.
- Hey, I got us through
the war all right.
- And nearly got hanged in peacetime.
- Jeez!
Boys, we don't want this!
- I'm the better soldier, Jesse!
- And I'm the better outlaw!
You both hate the railroad!
That's all that matters!
You do this job, and Thaddeus Rains
will never come west again!
- What are you talkin' about?
He's paying the payroll
out of his own fortune.
You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains,
don't you, Jesse?
- I still don't like it.
- Then let me run the show,
General Lee!
Jesse!
You want it?
All right.
We hit this bank.
You'll be smilin' once you got
that money in your pocket, cousin.
Cole Younger's gonna make
everyone rich! Whoo-hoo!
Hands in the air!
- We're robbin' this bank.
-
Move over there!
Everybody does what they're told,
nobody's gonna die. Hands up!
Oh, no. Uhh!
- Which one should I shoot first?
- None of'em.
Jesse!
You all right?
Head for the end
of the street!
- Look!
- Damn!
- Move! Go on!
- Another dozen out back.
- They gonna rush us?
Nah, they're just insurance
in case we run.
Inside!
For God's sakes, move!
Get in!
Any ideas, little brother?
Oh, Lord.
Hyah!
Uhh!
- Oh, Lord.
- Oh, Lord.
Fire! Come on!
Come on!
Look out!
- Damn!
- Hyah! Hyah!
Let's go.
Come on, boys!
- Giddap! Come on!
-  Hyah! Hyah!
-
- Jimmy!
- Damn!
- Look what they did to the town.
Easy, easy. Easy. It'll be okay.
Okay. Shh.
You're gonna rest here now.
- Bob, get some bandages.
-
How's 'bout some whiskey?
- Too young for whiskey.
- I think this time we'll
make an exception, Jim.
- Little brother... sorry.
All right, Jim?
I'm sorry.
It was the best time
of my life.
I was famous, ya know?
Yeah.
Little brother.
- He was just a kid.
- He was old enough.
He was a boy riding with
the most famous outlaws
in the West, Frank.
How was he supposed
to say no to that?
Railroad burned him out too.
You couldn't have stopped him.
You're a piss-poor liar
for the smartest man I know.
A war against
the railroad.
What the hell
was I thinkin'?
Well, I'm sure it seemed
like a good idea at the time.
- I'm out.
- You're out?
We ride for a year
and our blood gets spilled
and you're just gonna quit?
Who's next, Cole?
You? Me? Bob?
Frank?
Well... go on.
Get the hell out of here then.
Don't come back when you find
ou can't farm with a six-gun.
Jesse.
What are you thinkin'?
There are lawmen and bounty hunters
all over this county.
I had to see you.
I'm gettin' married.
I don't understand.
Well, she's the most
wonderful woman in the world.
I can't stop thinkin'
about her.
Zee, look, I've quit
my outlaw ways.
Come live in my home...
and in my heart.
Be my wife.
Is that a yes?
I never would've
imagined us in a place like this.
That's why I picked it.
We can start a whole new life here, Zee.
Do you think you'll be happy
here in Florida, Mr. James,
without all that excitement?
I've got you.
You keep me busy.
- I figure we can go up to
the hotel, get checked in,
- Mm-hmm.
And then I wanna do somethin'
I've been thinkin' about doin'
for a long, long time.
Driver, change of plans.
JesseJames.
JesseJames?
I could've lied, I guess,
but I want this marriage to be legal.
And I want you to know that I'm
trying to start a new life here,
so I'm depending on your...
- Discretion.
- Discretion.
- Sir, I'm a man of the cloth...
- Well, thank you.
Of course.
Now... let's have a drink.
In the church?
Communion!
-  Hands in the air!
This is a robbery!
Move! Move!
The safe! Now!
Of course. Of course.
- Sir?
- What?
Where's JesseJames?
- But the Youngers
ride with JesseJames.
- Hey! You wanna die?
No.
Did ride. No more.
Ya understand?
- The safe! Now! All right?
- All right, all right!
You know, JesseJames never
went around yellin' at folks.
It's still takin' too long.
People used to snap to.
Yeah, well, that was because of...
the reputation the gang had.
As long as people thinkJesse
is still ridin', we're not gonna
get the respect we deserve.
Cole, we're outlaws.
Not exactly the most respectable job,
if you know what I mean.
Bob, leave me alone, all right?
Go on.
- Hmm.
- "Hmm" what?
"For the life of theJames Gang wasn't
all robbing and shooting and killing.
"These young Missouri bucks
had a taste for the ladies,
- especially the handsome
and charismaticJesseJames."
- Beg your pardon?
True stories ofJesseJames."
- Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
- Let me see that.
I'm not finished.
"When he sauntered into
a saloon, his spurs janglin'
and his pockets full of gold,
the ladies flocked around him
like flies to a candied apple."
As I said, "Hmm."
'all wouldn't go believin' one of them
silly dime novels, would ya?
Swimming.
- Swimming is good.
-
Don't turn around.
What?
If you don't see it,
then it's not real.
JesseJames!
You're under arrest!
They arrested Jesse!
- What have you done?
- What's that, Bob?
- What have you done, Cole?
- I ain't done nothin', Bob.
Swear.
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
Bob... you know Cole
would never do such a thing.
He and Jesse are
best friends... cousins...
Bob.
Sorry, Cole.
- We're moving you tomorrow.
- But I like the presidential suite.
You'll get a similar room.
- But the hotel's in Washington, D.C.
- Nice.
You're not gonna get a fair
trial here in front of a jury
ofJesseJames sympathizers.
But I'll get a fair trail with a jury
bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
That's the idea.
- Did you order our houses burned down?
- Not that day.
that-that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains
and Parker that day.
- This was you, by the way.
- You almost ended my career
before it began.
Pity.
We're gonna hang you,
ou know.
Yeah, I figured.
Was it worth it?
- I should've just killed
Thaddeus Rains.
- That's what I'd have done.
I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard!
Oh, you'll miss me.
No.
I'll hang you.
About face!
March. March.
Come on, you!
So, this is he.
- I remember you.
- You're Parker.
I remember you too.
- You killed my ma.
- How did you know?
If that's the way you feel,
I could always take off his irons.
You stole thousands,
cost me tens of millions of dollars,
months of delays
in construction.
Oh, you like that?
Solid gold.
My father had it made.
When he started this railroad,
he gave it to me.
I'll give it to my son when
he takes over the company,
and he'll give it to his son.
The right sort of men will always
run this country, JesseJames.
Not your sort.
You'll always suffer.
And you haven't changed anything.
I made you think twice about burnin'
folks' homes down, now, didn't I?
We'll speak again
in Washington.
Oh, you're comin'
on the same train?
- Big words.
- It's a promise.
Get him on board.
- Come with me, boy.
Now your guns.
I don't like it.
We can handle him.
In the ten seconds
we have been in this car,
I've seen you get close enough...
forJesseJames to grab your guns
at least three times!
And believe me, if he lays a finger
on one of your guns,
ou are all...
and I mean  dead men.
He's chained up.
They'll put that on your tombstone.
Your guns.
- Gimme two good cards.
-
Hey, stupid!
Yeah, you.
Glad to see you know your name,
a dumb shit!
- What are you saying, boy?
- I think I recognize you.
- How?
- I think I saw you leavin'
by the front door...
just as I was
comin' in the back.
You shut up now, boy!
Yeah, your wife said
ou did that to her too.
Will this shut you up?
You know, I could do
this without the gun.
It just makes things easier.
- Yaah!
- Uhh!
There he is!
What the hell is that?
Vengeance. Outside.
Get up on the roof!
Go, go, go!
You stay put, gentlemen.
Where is that varmint?
Hold it!
- Nice shot!
- Thank you.
Go get my husband.
Giddap!
There's only four of'em!
Move, you fools!
Move!
Hands up!
Come on! Quickly!
This way.
Do it.
Uhh!
That was for my ma.
- This is for everybody else.
You and your wife.
That is a nice watch you got there.
Hand it over.
If I can get you today,
ou damn sure know I can kill you
anytime I want, now that I'm free.
You sleep on that
for the next 20 years.
Give it to me.
Get your hands up! Now!
Tennessee. The railroad has
no business in Tennessee.
Therefore I have no interest
in the state ofTennessee.
Thank you.
I'd just as soon kill you,
JesseJames,
but chasin' ya takes up
too much of my time.
Fair enough.
JesseJames.
- Come on! Let's ride!
- Hyah!
- You get arrested again,
I'll kill you.
- Yes, ma'am.
- I can't believe that I had
to blow up a train for you.
- You are a hell of a woman.
- Don't swear!
- Yes, ma'am.
- I missed you, cousin.
- I missed you too, cousin.
You know, uh...
You know, when you got caught,
some people thought maybe
I had somethin' to do with it.
- The thought never crossed my mind.
- Good.
Things changed when you
quit the gang, Jesse.
For example, I'm the one
who now says, "Let's ride."
- He ain't bad at it.
- Yeah?
- It's tougher than it looks.
- Yeah!
- Where'd you get these riders?
- A farm?
- Down in Tennessee.
- Hmm. All right.
You, uh... You wanna maybe ride
with the Younger Gang for
a while before you do that?
- Bye, boys.
Tom.
- Yeah, I think so.
- I'll meet you there in a couple weeks.
And, uh... thanks for that
distraction back there.
Hell, they hardly
even noticed us.
- Mrs. James?
- Shall we?
Shall we, indeed. Frank.
Rangers.
- Tennessee?
- I'll explain on the way.
All right, boys.
Let's ride! Hah!
- When were you plannin' on tellin' me?
- I just did.
- Only because I asked?
- Damn! Am I ever gonna win with you?
- Don't change the subject.
-
