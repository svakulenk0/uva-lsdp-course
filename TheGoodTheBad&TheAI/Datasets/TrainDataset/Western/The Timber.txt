I don't remember much about my father,
Jebediah Seagrave.
I don't care to neither.
I remember his horse, Abraham,
with those coal black eyes.
I do remember my mother's face,
watching him as he rode off.
Hard to say as to say
what actually happened up there
in those mining camps.
The story goes;
He and his men came up empty
turned on each other.
People said it was my father
who clone the killing.
I hope you find
what you're looking for.
Come on.
One thing, Wyatt.
I intend to bring Father back.
I'm going to stand the son
of a bitch in front of Mother,
have him look her in the eye
and explain why he left.
I can't do that if he's dead.
He ain't the type of man
to be stood up in front of nobody.
I want Mother to hear it.
If Jesus himself
came down off the cross
and told her the truth,
she wouldn't hear it.
What do you know about Jesus?
Oh, I know plenty.
I got to try.
He's a murderer, Samuel!
Yeah, well who ain't?
You wouldn't know nothing about it.
Promise me
we're going to bring him back alive.
You got my word.
What can we do you for, Sheriff?
A man in Mr. Hall's employ
was killed last night.
Up in the high country north of here.
Got his throat cut
and his gold stolen from him.
Did you figure out
who it was that did this?
She saw the whole thing.
Now she described the assassin.
I was reminded of you, Wyatt.
I wasn't anywhere near there.
I'll take a gander in your saddlebags
if you've no objection.
Well...
I wonder if you might have
hid the treasure in your house,
- or your-
- I'll tell you what,
you set one foot on my property
and I'll shoot you myself.
You rest assured, sir,
I'll be keeping close tabs on you...
and yours.
Jesus, Wyatt. Nothing's been drawn.
He can kiss my ass.
That old coot's got a gun and a badge,
and a bug up his ass over you.
Oh, he just likes to
give himself talk, is all.
Where did you disappear
to last night, anyway?
Felt the need to dip my wick
and have a coke,
not that it's any
of your fucking business.
Right on time.
Allow me to introduce
Colonel Rupert Thomas,
a veteran of the Indian wars,
instrumental in the campaigns
against Red Cloud and the Sioux.
The Colonel will be accompanying
you both as guide,
and as a representative of the bank.
That wasn't part of our agreement.
As the Colonel is familiar
with the territory,
I think you'll find
him a very valuable asset.
Asset or not, we had a deal.
I'm afraid the matter
is not open to discussion.
I'm counting on your expertise, Colonel.
I foresee none
but the usual travails, Mr. Howell.
What do you think?
I'll tell you what.
If ol' Rupert over there
even looks at me crossways,
I'm gonna gut him like a pig
and ditch his carcass
in the nearest crick.
Hey, Rupert!
You coming?
One thing.
A man to Halston came back.
You know his name?
Hawkins. Percival Hawkins.
Well, I'm going to need to talk to him.
You know where we can find him?
Indeed I do.
Whoa.
This is it.
Anybody in there?
Hey!
What?
Hey can we, ah,
speak to you for a second, please?
Hey, slow down there.
Hey, we ain't trying to hurt you,
just trying to ask
a couple of questions.
Hey, can you... can you hear me?
Show him the picture.
You know this man?
I make that to be
an affirmative response.
Come here. Let me see.
Here, let me see it.
- Jesus.
- It was hands, Jesus.
- Hands.
- It's his tongue, right?
It's ripped out.
It's no ordinary type of evil would turn
a mountain of a man
like him into mush.
Did you ever doubt
it was done to shut him up?
Hey, look.
Well, if that was the goal,
either by Jebediah's hand or another,
I call this a grand success.
It's a shame.
He's a good-looking bastard.
You knew he was mute.
Why the hell
didn't you say something?
Man lost his boy a few weeks back.
I was leading another expedition.
We ran out of supplies.
Forced to turn back,
we ran across him in the timber.
Panicked.
Tried to warn the poor bastard.
Come on!
The eggs are frozen.
Morning, Lisa.
Looks like the boys
left you a little shy on wood.
I can chop some if need be.
What can I do for you, Sheriff?
I wanted to ask you
a couple 'a questions...
About...?
Your brother-in-law.
My dear.
What's he done?
You expecting company?
What can I do for you boys?
We're here to survey the property.
For what purpose,
and on whose authority?
Mr. George Howell
of the Dawson City Bank.
They're foreclosing on the 28th...?
Get the gun.
God damn it! Get the horses!
Samuel, get the horses!
Go!
God damn it!
God damn it!
Come here, girl, come here.
Come here. Come here. You alright?
Come here.
The horses?
One got away.
The other one's got
a broken fetlock, I think.
Where are you going?
Jesus Christ, Wyatt.
You're a real genius.
Fuck!
How are we to continue?
Wagon gone,
two horses lost!
You know what?
We got one horse left.
Quit your whining, we'll make do.
The bulk of these supplies was to be
delivered to Hall's man York!
What am I supposed to tell him?
You could tell York to come
and fetch it himself!
Each and every item on this wagon was
duly entered into my log!
I am I am accountable!
You wanna pull that piece?
You gonna stand there like a cunt?
My employer has entrusted me with a task
that I intend to fulfill.
Believe me when I say, sir,
I wish it were otherwise.
We'll continue to the start line
as planned.
He's a good man, York.
Runs a tight ship.
It's the Colonel!
York?
It's Colonel Thomas.
I'm afraid we've lost our wagon
and your shipment
a few miles south from here.
Colonel, is it really you?
Easy. Easy.
These are the carriers.
Carriers?
Have you struck a new vein?
Hey, we ain't going back,
you know that, right?
Wait here.
Ugh!
Is this some kind of a joke?
Joke?
Are you all mad?
- Has this entire company gone mad?
- Yes!
Now you see what I'm up against!
- Degenerative lust. All of them.
- Come on.
Scheming. Plotting against me!
Let's kill them all!
No gold.
Samuel.
What am I looking at?
She'll be all right.
She's a strong woman.
I just wonder how she's doing
with the baby is all.
Still haven't given him a name yet.
Four months old and no name, huh?
Come on...
You know what.
Maybe
you should ask someone who gives a shit.
Which ain't yours truly.
You son of a bitch.
Help me UP.
Come on, brother. You' re OK.
What's the Timber like, Colonel?
Eventful.
You ever met
the fella we're going after?
I'm afraid I have not had that pleasure.
Pleasure?
I can't say as
I ever experienced much in the way
of pleasure in the company of Jebediah.
What about you, Samuel?
Howell tell you that
me and Samuel are kin to Jebediah?
He tell you we ain't seen
him since we was boys?
I believe I'll retire for the night,
gentlemen.
Yeah, you do that.
You been meaning to pick a fight
since you laid eyes on him.
I don't trust the son of a bitch.
You saw what he did to his man York.
You really think he means us harm?
Means it or not, if it comes to that,
I will cut his fucking throat.
I don't know as there's any
call to take it so personal, Wyatt.
If he intends to hurry the reaper,
then by God I call that personal.
Colonel,
one more thing.
Once Mr. Seagrave is dead
kill them both.
You sense it, too.
What's that?
Our demise.
When we was kids,
mother used to chorus Bible verses.
I do remember her saying something
about the road to hell
being paved with good intentions.
I can't say my intentions
have always been good.
In fact, I'd venture to say...
I believe I'm going to hell.
I aimed to kill Jebediah...
Wyatt!
Wyatt!
Wyatt!
Wyatt!
Cut me down! God damn it,
You all right?
I cut my hand.
This is a nightmare.
Where's the horse?
She run off.
Which way?
Where you going?
We'll never make
it back home without a horse.
We ain't going back home.
We're licked, Wyatt.
- Going back...
- We've got no food,
ain't an option.
I pissed my pants, Wyatt...
I was hanging upside down
not five minutes ago with piss
running up my neck!
I'm done. It's over.
What the hell am I doing out here?
Listen.
I've got a wife and baby at home.
Listen to me.
Look at me.
You were the one
that wanted to bring Jebediah back.
You were the one who said
he had to be held accountable.
Well he's not worth dying over.
Now I'm going home, Wyatt.
I'm going home to my wife
and my son where I belong.
You want to come with...
Be my guest.
I ain't going home, Samuel.
Then fare thee well.
I'm afraid it's not enough.
We had a deal.
Taking into account interest accrued,
back taxes, penalties...
In English.
You're still in arrears.
I'm afraid the bank
has no choice but to foreclose
according to the terms
of your contract...
That ain't right!
The contract you co-signed
with your brother.
You have one week to
vacate the premises.
I did what you asked me to.
I got you your gold.
There might be a way.
I don't presume to pry, Rupert,
I am just fucking cold is all.
You know what?
I figure you ain't got
much need for this.
As mine dries out.
Thank you, Rupert. Thank you.
Hell. I ain't coming to get you,
if that's what you think.
Least I'll have my hide
if something happens to you.
Samuel!
Samuel!
Samuel!
Samuel!
Samuel!
Samuel!
Mr. Hawkins?
What the hell are you doing here?
What do you want?
I'm looking for my brother.
We was together. You know, when we...
Hey! Hey!
You get your goddamn hand off me,
you understand?
Is that a bear?
You know where he is?
You're gonna take me to him?
Let's go.
In there?
I take it you ain't coming with me.
Samuel.
Samuel!
Samuel. Samuel, get up.
Samuel, it's me!
Wake up, wake up.
It's me.
You stupid son of a bitch.
Lisa would kill me if I didn't get you.
We...
We have to go right now.
Come on.
Samuel, take this.
Go, go, go!
Wyatt!
Samuel
Wyatt!
Let's go.
Have I lived such
a sheltered life, Wyatt?
I used to think it was the gold
that turned men bad,
but now I'm starting to think,
they was just that way to begin with.
I don't want this kind of life
for my son, Wyatt.
I don't... want
to raise him in this kind of world.
It ain't an easy place, this world,
even in the best of times.
Well then I hope damn to make it so.
Or if not easy, at least bearable.
That's a tall order.
The world is as it's always been,
always will be.
God damn your pessimism.
I've seen too much
to believe otherwise, Samuel.
I wish it weren't so.
Jebediah's up there somewhere.
You wanna make
a better world for your boy,
I figure up there
is a good place to start.
We've only got one knife
between the two of us.
We could have come better
equipped is all I'm saying.
Stand back! Let's do it!
I don't care!
State your fucking business.
We're looking for a man
called Jebediah Seagrave.
We' re his sons.
Hey, Jim!
These boys
claim they're kin to Jebediah.
Is that right?
You must be Wyatt.
I am.
The prodigal son.
Prodigal or not, I'm here,
and I'm looking for him.
Where's my father?
He's been expecting you.
Daniel!
This base creature dare
to tempt the divine,
having crawled out of the slime
and called himself king,
while God himself is too modest
to make such a boast...
As if He did not foresee this,
or was not cognizant
of every unfolding step
of this dire plot against his kingdom
by his ungrateful progeny,
which, spewing venom and bile,
He has ordained that his son's
flesh shall be flayed open
until such a time as his black
heart stops beating
and then and only then can
the worm be brought before Him.
Put your backs into it,
you gutless heathens...
Sons of whores,
unfit to breathe the same air
as these wormy, ill-tempered bitches...
The world is cold and lost to me.
Doesn't matter if I'm warm or not.
It's your mind that lies to you,
not the world.
I assure you the world
remains unchanged.
Do you think Lisa
and the boy are safe?
When I close my eyes, I see her here.
But I fear she is dead.
She ain't dead. She's fine.
Look at your hand.
- Alright, okay.
- Fuck.
- God save us all!
- God save us all!
Come on! Come on!
Everybody, back!
Listen to me, you crazy son of a bitch.
You are going to get your sorry ass up
and you are going
to take us to Jebediah.
You understand?
Do you understand me?
I want them off the land,
upright or otherwise,
it makes no difference to me.
A hundred dollar bonus...
per man...
when the job is done.
Push on.
Crow a tune.
Color even,
for an adversity.
Push on a kiss,
all the colors.
By another name, go on.
I used to sing that to your father.
He liked it, yes he did.
We have to turn back.
How much further?
I fear it's too late.
Answer the goddamn question!
How far is it!
Not far. Not far at all.
I heard you was expecting us.
You came to kill me.
I did.
He came to take you back.
I never amounted to much,
and I doubt that I ever will.
But Samuel is worth saving.
We are the same you and I.
Doomed to live in woe
to labor in darkness.
Like hell we are.
You came to kill me...
Do it.
Samuel.
No. No!
Who are you to judge me?
To try to understand and comprehend
that which broods over me?
The burdens I shoulder?
Worlds that I command,
bursting forth in bone
and flesh and blood!
You must be Lisa.
I have here a notice of foreclosure.
Fully notarized.
This... is our land.
None of the lies or false claims
in the world will change that.
Turn your horses and ride off.
Kindly escort
the Seagraves from my property.
Father!
Stop this.
He came here to die.
Let him.
Cut him down!
He chose his fate,
just as you have chosen yours.
There's a baby.
Do you not remember me?
Or Wyatt?
I do not recognize you.
There's a baby inside.
Not another step.
I came to take you back.
There's no going back, is there?
Maggie!
There is a woman on the inside.
Howell!
Lisa, Lisa.
Maggie.
You wouldn't happen
to have a swig of whiskey on you?
It ain't so bad as I feared.
Don't die, Wyatt.
Wyatt.
Wyatt.
I wanted to tell you
how I felt about you, Maggie,
but my own cowardice prevented me,
and now that you're gone,
it's my grief that stops me.
Hey, Sheriff!
What?
Oil.
