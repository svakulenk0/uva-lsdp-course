SERGEANT: Halt.
- Whoa.
SERGEANT: Have a pass?
- Yes, sir, captain.
Sam Moore.
What's your business, Sam?
Going to visit your wife?
No, sir.
I was going away from her, and fast too.
- All right. Let him through.
- Giddap, Dolly.
SERGEANT:
Step aside for the stagecoach.
Hello, Ted. How many you got?
Three, sergeant, and a lady.
SERGEANT:
Your passes, please.
Mr. Colburn, Army sutler.
Judge Hatfield.
Oh, good morning, Your Honor.
John Goodrich, merchant of Richmond.
And the lady...
...Julia Hayne, Virginia City, Nevada.
And what is your business in Richmond,
Miss Hayne?
To visit the commanding officer
at Libby Prison.
SERGEANT:
You got folks in there?
I'm a Southerner.
- The commander's my friend.
SERGEANT: Sorry, ma'am.
All right, gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
Go ahead, Ted. Let them through.
Let them up.
That last shift didn't do so badly.
Forty-four, 45...
...46, 47...
...48.
That means we've passed
the powder magazine.
Yeah, and it lays rights over here.
- How much further we got to dig, captain?
- Oh, about five more feet.
Only eight more hours till we're free.
Gosh, my pa must have been a beaver.
He probably was.
- Guard.
- Yes, sir?
Open up.
Captain Irby, you ain't going
in that lower-west alone.
Them Union prisoners sure is savage.
IRBY: Do as I tell you
and lock the door behind me.
GUARD:
Yes, sir.
You. You, up.
Okay.
You, on your feet.
You too.
And you.
All right, you four men, move it.
Come on, move the stove.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Heave.
- Heave.
- Heave.
- Heave.
IRBY:
Now, clear out.
No, no. It's no use.
He wouldn't dare come alone
if they didn't know he was coming.
Now, get back
and look out for yourselves.
Hey.
What are you doing?
IRBY:
All right, you men. Come on out.
You hear me? Come on out of there.
You made quite a bit of the headway with
your system of operation, Captain Bradford.
That tunnel wasn't a bad idea.
But I happened to learn you were digging it
three days after you started last spring.
Three months and almost 13 days.
And you let us go on working, did you?
All that time, killing ourselves,
trying to get out of that rat-hole?
You've led two other attempts
to break out of prison, Bradford...
...one of which cost the lives
of some of my men.
Since solitary confinement means nothing to
men like you, except to make you worse...
...I thought this time
I'd let you work out your own punishment.
That was a very amusing idea, captain.
I see you've quite a sense of humor.
This time, it's final.
You and these two
know the penalty for third-escape try.
You think that'd be any worse
than rotting in this fever-hole?
If you'd like to dig further, you're welcome.
Only no matter where you come up...
...under that shed
across the vacant ground as you planned...
...or where the sewer comes into the canal,
you'll find a few bayonets waiting for you.
- That's all.
- No, no.
That's not quite all, captain.
You must allow me to thank you
for the timely warning.
And it was very gallant of you
letting us amuse ourselves in there.
And believe me,
if ever the opportunity arises...
...l'll repay you
for every foot of this tunnel, with interest.
I'll be at your service
and it'll be a pleasure.
Captain, there's a lady waiting inside.
Julia.
Julia.
I wondered if I'd ever see you again.
Haven't you forgotten?
Forgotten? How could I?
But I've changed.
Not to me.
And you, Vance.
What's been happening to you?
Of course, I knew you were here.
Certain people in Virginia City told me that.
That's simple enough. Here, sit down.
Thank you.
They gave me this job while
I was convalescing from Chancellorsville.
Thank heaven I'm fit and ready for service
as soon as they can find some use for me.
Vance,
the war's going badly for us, isn't it?
Very badly, Julia.
The South hasn't anything left
to fight with except the will.
Wars are won with gold nowadays,
not with men.
And the North has the gold.
That's why Sherman's in Atlanta.
But if the South had the gold
to buy supplies, arms, powder...
Who's going to stake us?
Jeff Davis is bankrupt.
There's hardly a dime
in the Confederate treasury.
Even England has stopped her credits.
We're lucky if we last another six months.
I'm not thinking about credits, Vance.
I'm thinking about a gift to the South
of $5 million in gold bullion.
- Julia, you're crazy. Where in the world...?
- Virginia City.
Impossible.
That's a Yank stronghold and...
You're familiar with Virginia City.
Have you forgotten?
It's one of the richest mining centers in the
world. And the biggest mine owners there...
Of course.
Dr. Cameron, Armistead, Marshall,
all Southerners.
Whose loyalty adds up to the $5 million
which they're giving to the Confederacy.
But they can't move it out
for fear of stirring up a suspicion.
They need a leader,
someone strong, resourceful...
...who knows all the country between.
- That's why I've come straight to you.
- To me?
Yes, you're the only one who could do it.
Is that the only reason
you came straight to me?
Oh, l...
I don't know, Vance.
I still don't know.
But you're my oldest
and my dearest friend.
I knew I could trust you.
Tell me, why did you leave
your home here and go north?
Was it because of me?
Well, partly that then,
because I wasn't sure.
I wanted to sing.
Father was so furious.
A Hayne on the public stage.
You gave a recital in Boston, I heard.
Only one.
Then the war.
Oh, it was a long jump, Vance,
from Boston to Virginia City...
...singing in the Sazerac Saloon.
But why?
Virginia City is a loyal Yankee nest.
Drunken Union soldiers talk and I listen.
I'm a very good listener, Vance.
And what I hear, I pass on.
And that's why you were chosen
to come here.
Yes. To get your help.
Oh, so much depends in you, Vance.
You must go and see the president.
MAN:
Mr. President, we must face the facts.
The Army's half starved,
therefore is only at half its strength.
Each week,
thousands of our boys are dying...
...for lack of proper equipment
and medical supplies.
What the captain suggests
is dangerous and difficult...
...but the $5 million these people
are willing to sacrifice may save the South.
How do you propose to bring the gold
to Richmond, Captain Irby?
Between Nevada and the Mississippi
there are 17 Union forts...
...guarding the roads
and every inch of the river.
Quite true, but I have planned
a route by which I hope to dodge them...
...but it's a great deal harder
and longer than the old immigrant trail.
If you'll permit me
to demonstrate on your map.
Go right ahead, sir.
I'd head due south through lower Nevada
and the territory of New Mexico to Texas.
A convoy could meet us
at our Amarillo outpost...
...rush the gold to Galveston,
then by a blockade runner...
...all the way around to Wilmington,
then here.
- How long would it take to reach Amarillo?
- About four weeks.
It makes sense to me, Mr. President.
How well do you know
that southwest country, captain?
I've hunted, scouted
and driven cattle through most of it.
I know every water hole and arroyo,
almost every cactus bush.
It's pretty dry and barren,
but I'm sure I can make it.
Well, General Page.
If Captain Irby says he can, he will, sir.
Jeb Stuart told me
he was the smartest scout he ever had.
And he added that Irby could lead
a cavalry raid to Hades and back.
From what I hear, that's a pretty accurate
description of Virginia City, general.
By the way, Irby, where is the messenger
who brought us the good news?
One moment, sir.
Julia,
the president would like to see you.
Mr. President,
may I present Miss Julia Hayne...
...the daughter of Colonel Hayne.
Mr. President.
I knew your father, Miss Hayne.
He was a gallant soldier...
...which explains the courage you found
for such a dangerous mission.
Thank you, Mr. President.
We're proud of you and deeply grateful.
Good luck to you, captain.
The hopes of 10 million
will be riding with you.
Doggone that confounded...
...dadgummed, slab-sided, dad-burned,
tarnation, doggone...
MOOSE:
Quiet.
MARBLEHEAD:
...buffalo.
Right. The lamp.
Irby left the joker in the pack
when he didn't shut off this tunnel.
Sure enough left the road open
to the powder magazine.
- There it is.
- Yeah. Here.
Hey, not yet.
Wait until the sentry changes at 10:00.
MARBLEHEAD:
Doggone that confounded...
- Shut up.
...dadgummed...
- What are they digging?
- Earthworks, the last line of defense.
Is it as bad as that? Are they so close?
Seventy miles,
at Spotsylvania Court House.
But they'll never take Richmond now, Julia.
You've brought us new hope.
Who's billeted here?
The 17th Cavalry.
They're using it as headquarters.
They'll probably move on any day now.
Looks strange, doesn't it?
Oh, Vance,
do you remember the old days here?
The parties father used to have
in this house?
It was fun growing up together,
wasn't it?
IRBY: I wish it could have lasted forever.
We were close then.
Do you remember the last Christmas
I spent here before the war?
Frost was glistening in all the fields...
...holly wreaths were in all those windows,
mistletoe in the hall.
And Father standing in the doorway
with the light behind him...
...so straight and proud and handsome.
And now...
...wet leaves cover the ground at Shiloh,
don't they, Vance?
Julia, why do you torture yourself
with memories?
What have I got left?
The war's taken everything.
Not me, Julie.
Perhaps someday we...
But now, I just feel dead inside
and I will be till the war is over.
When do you start west?
Tomorrow, by troop train to the border,
then by stage.
We'll see each other later then
at Virginia City.
Yes. But remember, when we meet,
we've never seen each other before.
- Then the Federals can't suspect.
- Oh, I'm an expert at that now.
Treating friends like strangers
and enemies like friends.
I won't forget.
What time is it?
Around 10:00.
Let's go back to Richmond.
IRBY:
The prison.
Back to town
as quick as you can make it.
Dog-darn this dad-blame swamp.
Marble, I never thought
you'd turn out to be a water buffalo.
If I don't get out of this water,
it's gonna take the curl out of my hair.
If you don't shut up, you're gonna have
a bullet parting your hair.
MAN:
Here are some tracks, men.
They're running every which way,
but they're probably headed upstream.
Come on.
All fish head upstream, my friend,
that's how they get caught.
Come on.
Gentlemen, this is Captain Bradford...
...one of our most reliable sources
of enemy intelligence.
I question that, sir.
A man of any intelligence would hardly
spend a vacation in Libby Prison.
I understand, at the time of your capture...
...you were tracing the report
of gold shipments to Richmond.
That's correct. The shipments were made.
Ridiculous. How could the silver and gold
that might dribble through to the rebels...
...affect the outcome of this war
one way or another?
They couldn't, sir,
so long as those shipments were small.
I have reason to believe the rebels'
next shipments will involve millions.
- That could prolong this conflict for years.
- Where could they get millions?
Only one place, sir. Virginia City in Nevada.
Three of the richest mines in America...
...belong to Southern sympathizers there.
- Virginia City. That's a rebel hotbed.
- You'll have to watch yourself.
- Thank you. We will.
By the way,
I'm taking these men with me, sir.
We always work together.
Well, what are their qualifications?
Well, sir, Marblehead there...
Yes, sir.
...he's probably one of the finest
horse-thieves east of Chicago.
- You mean Kansas City, sir.
- Oh, Kansas City.
- And Moose.
- Yes, sir.
Well, he's had four wives, so he's had
to learn how to keep undercover.
Shucks.
Well, that settles it.
Draw what money you need
from the paymaster.
And before you leave, look over
the Washington reports on Virginia City.
BRADFORD: Thank you.
- Good luck to you.
Thank you, sir.
- Sir.
- Sir.
Hey, why did you say
I only had four wives?
- Well, what was it, five?
MOOSE: Sure.
BRADFORD:
Oh, I keep losing count.
This is most uncomfortable.
I've never had such a rough ride.
My congressman
will certainly hear about this road.
In fact,
I think I'll write to President Lincoln.
He's kind of busy right now.
- There's a war on, you know.
- Oh, the war, the war.
When I think of all those brave boys
on the battlefield, so many of them.
- It's bad for business, you know.
- What is your business, mister?
Life insurance.
- Perhaps I could interest you in a policy.
- No, thanks.
Great American Insurance Company,
Cleveland, Ohio. Fine protection.
- I would not be a good risk.
- Nonsense, you look as fit as a fiddle.
I suppose you avoid
all unnecessary forms of excitement?
Oh, sure, sure.
I just sit home, reading books.
Oh, you Westerners are lucky.
No taxes to speak of,
nothing to worry about.
Of course, you are deprived of the glorious
opportunity to defend your country.
You are lucky to be out here.
They tell me they are
drafting men your age in the North.
Yes. Yes, they are.
That's the part of the war
I don't approve of.
What business
are you three gentlemen in?
- Well...
- We're in the mining business.
Gold mining. We thought we'd mosey
around Virginia City for a spell.
Doesn't your friend know there's more
silver than gold in Virginia City?
- Yes, but...
- We're in both.
That's it.
So you're from Virginia City,
are you, Miss Hayne? You haven't said.
Haven't I?
Now that we've all mentioned
our business, how about you?
Since you joined us a few miles back, I
suppose you live in this part of the country.
- Cattle business?
- No, no.
Maybe you could say I handle hardware.
- Full line?
- Oh, full enough.
- Hardware.
- Here is one of my samples.
You take this, Mr. Marblehead.
I'm a trifle gun shy.
Any of you gentlemen
happen to be carrying a gun?
No, no, no, not me. I never touch them.
All I want's a pocket full of rocks.
Guns are for warlike people.
What made you ask?
MAN: This country isn't as soft
around here as this gentleman thinks.
- Did you ever hear of John Murrell?
- No. Who is he?
You mean, Murrell's guerrillas?
Sure we've heard of them.
They're a pack of murderous skunks.
MAN:
Hey, you are right.
- Beautiful work, don't you think?
- Yes.
These things make me nervous.
Thank you.
This is his stamping ground.
Murrell specializes in stagecoaches.
He wouldn't dare
hold up the United States mail.
I'd protest to the Post Office Department
immediately.
Murrell wouldn't be after the mail.
Not with five business men like us,
carrying between us maybe 15- Or $20,000.
Yes, that's right.
We would be a pretty good haul at that.
That's what I figured. Now there isn't
any point in making any trouble.
If you'll hand over quickly what you have,
nobody will get hurt.
Well, doggone if you'd take
a man's father's watch.
MARBLEHEAD:
Dadgum.
Quickly.
Now you.
I take it you're Mr. Murrell?
You are a smart fellow.
Come on, hand over, if you please.
But that's the point. I don't please.
Don't be funny, mister.
This gun has a hair trigger.
- Don't be a fool, Kerry, he might shoot.
- Go on, give him the doggone money.
It won't go off. Would you like to bet?
Oh, please, Mr. Bradford...
Why, Miss Hayne.
Such solicitude is very touching.
You were saying, sir?
I do not particularly want to shoot you,
mister, but I do not mind.
If you'll look back out of the window,
you will see why.
- Guerrillas.
- Yes, Murrell's guerrillas.
I think I outdraw you, eh, mister?
Maybe. I've only got one pair,
but that ought to be enough.
Don't reach for that. Get them up.
I thought that little derringer of yours looked
a little bit too well used to be a sample.
In any case, I didn't like your face.
As a matter of fact, I still don't.
See if he's got another gun, Moose.
MARBLEHEAD: Give me that stuff.
MOOSE: Give me that money.
MARBLEHEAD: You leather-headed...
MOOSE: Your purse, madam.
I'll say he's in the hardware business.
Driver.
Now, Mr. Murrell...
...you're gonna tell your little boys playtime
is over and you're coming along with us.
Driver, pull up.
Now then,
start talking and make it quick and fast.
Come on.
Put up your guns, boys.
This fellow, he's got the drop on me.
If you shoot, he'll plug me.
You go back and don't follow.
He means business.
Mr. Driver, please drive
before they change their minds.
Now, Mr. Murrell,
would you be kind enough to step out?
No, you'd best ride on top,
we don't like your company.
- What makes you think I would?
- Hope three ain't crowding.
- Keep that on him till the next station.
- I don't need this peashooter.
Keep my hands on him, you mean.
All right, son.
TED:
Bess, Dolly.
Just to think, I tried to sell
that ruffian life insurance.
Oh, he wasn't as tough as my last wife.
- Pardon, I didn't know you were married.
- Married? Only four times.
Five.
All insured, I hope.
Never mind. Don't pay any attention to me.
I don't know what I'm saying. I'm all upset.
That's the tightest squeeze
I was ever in in my life.
How about you, ma'am?
Don't you think
the heroics were a trifle exaggerated?
Ma'am, you don't know him. You should
have saw the last mess he got us out of.
Why, the night we started the dig...
You have a peculiar way
of looking at things, Miss Hayne.
- What?
BRADFORD: Pardon me.
Try it that way.
The other can be done, but it is difficult.
I was silly, wasn't I?
But I was rude. Sorry.
I deserved it. I haven't said thank you.
- Lf you hadn't been here, Mr. Bradford...
- But I had to be here.
Don't you believe in predestination?
You had to be here too, so did Murrell.
There's probably future reason for it.
MARBLEHEAD:
Hey, Kerry.
The driver says there's a $5000 reward
for this shadbelly.
TED: That's a lot of money
for buzzard-bait like him.
MURRELL:
You have not collected yet.
You doggone, tin-horn gambler.
Murrell's loose.
MARBLEHEAD: Doggone the dad-burn-it.
Stuck in the creek.
All right, folks,
unload and give us a push.
Ain't nothing else to do.
Here's where we start playing horses.
This is a dreadful situation.
I shall most certainly write
the Bureau of Rivers and Harbors about this.
TED: All right, folks,
unload and give us a push.
Oh, no. No, don't put me down.
- Don't put me here.
- There you are.
Now then, you stay there.
If you behave yourself,
I may come back and get you.
Hey. Watch that there rock.
That one?
Hey.
I knew there was something I forgot.
Kerry, if you let me fall...
I wish you would.
I fell 10 days ago.
Hurry up, Kerry.
You're too slow for a packhorse.
- Late today.
TED: Had a rough trip.
- Any mail?
TED: Yup.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
We won't be here long, folks,
don't stray off.
- Where are we gonna stray to?
- Well, got a fair-to-middling saloon.
What about you, little man?
Will you have a drink?
A drink? Moosehead,
when I come out of that saloon...
...l'd be so teetotally tight that if I live
to be 108 years old I'll die with a hangover.
Go ahead, boys, have something.
I don't mind if you wanna join them.
You know,
for the first time in years, I don't.
You're a strange trio.
They're so totally different
from you in every way.
I've often wondered
what brought you together.
Oh, just luck, like you and I.
The interesting part is, what keeps
people together, don't you think?
Hello.
What were you dreaming?
Oh, about us.
Was I behaving myself?
We were climbing a mountain together
and we were almost at the top.
But suddenly you stopped me...
...as if there was something on the other
side you were afraid for me to see.
There isn't, Kerry, is there?
I've been looking on the other side
of mountains all my life.
- Usually, all I've got was a bumped nose.
- Oh, don't tease me.
There isn't much time.
- We know so little about each other.
- What do we wanna know?
You're a very charming young woman.
Well bred, obviously. Highly respectable.
Me? Well, I suppose
I'm just a soldier of misfortune.
It's a very interesting combination.
Anything could happen.
What do you mean,
we haven't got much time?
This time tomorrow,
we'll be in Virginia City.
Well...
...you make that sound so final.
There maybe some things
that you won't understand.
I only understand that we've gotta go on
seeing each other and being together.
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?
Julia, is that all you've got to say?
Look, three weeks ago, I had no more idea
than you where this was all going to lead.
But I know one thing now,
it can't end here.
You know that too.
Yes, I do know it, Kerry.
But promise me one thing,
that we won't cross bridges...
...or ask any questions
till we know what's on the other side.
- Promise?
- Promise.
MAN:
This is the latest news.
"Tonight, with the fall of Vicksburg...
...the entire Mississippi River
is in the hands of the Union Army.
Sherman has destroyed Atlanta...
...and the railroad that connects
the deep South with Virginia.
The rebels are on the run,
physically and financially.
Only an act of God
can now prevent a great Union victory."
Virginia City, Kerry.
Yes.
Looks like they're celebrating our arrival.
Glad to be home?
Oh, yes, of course.
- Now, now, take it easy.
- What you need is a good, stiff drink.
That's the best advice
I've had since I've been on this trip.
This is the roughest ride I've ever had.
I'm certainly gonna write a letter
to my congressman.
I would too.
BO Y:
Miss Julia. Miss Julia.
Oh, Cobby. How are you, Cobby?
- I missed you, but I'm glad you're back.
- Thank you.
This is Cobby, Mr. Bradford.
- How do you do, Cobby?
- How do you do?
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Same here.
A rival, huh?
Well, I hope they're all that size.
We want every copperhead Southerner
in Virginia City to see this.
And remember it because the next time
we hang one of them...
...it won't be filled with sawdust.
Driver, will you get my grip?
I'll get it for you, I know where it is.
Julia, what's the matter?
Oh, I think I'll get out.
- My home is near here.
- Wait a minute.
Why, you haven't even
told me your address.
We'll see each other, Kerry.
- I'm in a hurry.
- You're not in that much of a hurry.
How can I show up at your home
to pay my respects to your family?
I haven't any family.
Oh, sorry.
COBBY: Here they are, Miss Julia,
I got them both.
Well, thank you, Cobby. Oh, just two.
I have another one on the rack.
Would you get it for me, please?
Sure.
This is very interesting, Captain Bradford.
The Bureau of Military Information
is unduly alarmed.
I can assure you we have
the local situation well in hand.
Yes, I read your reports in Washington, sir.
But from our information...
...the next rebel attempt to run gold
might be more successful.
Eh?
- They have a new leader.
- So, what's his name?
I wish I knew, sir.
All we do know is that he came west
from Richmond about a month ago.
By the way,
where do the local Southerners gather?
Oh, no one place in particular.
The Crystal Bar, Sazerac.
Would you like an escort
to show you around?
Oh, I think we can manage,
thank you, sir.
You don't happen to know
the Haynes family here, do you?
The Haynes family?
No, I never heard of them. Why?
Oh, nothing. Just friends. That's funny.
I was under the impression she...
The family that is.
...lived in Virginia City.
You seem to have two problems, captain.
I should be interested to hear
what you find out in either case.
You'll be among the first to know,
I assure you.
- Good day, sir.
- Good luck, gentlemen.
Good day, major.
Hello, Cobby.
- Mr. Vance.
- Hello, Cobby, what's on your mind?
Miss Julia came in
on the stage last night...
...but she was afraid to come here,
so she sent me.
But she wants you
to meet her at the Sazerac tonight.
- How did she look, Cobby?
- Oh, swell.
Happy as a colt in clover.
- Thanks. That's fine. Come on, get to work.
COBBY: Yes, sir.
MAN 1:
Hey, kid. Give us a hand here.
IRBY: Measure your pourings carefully, boys,
and keep those bars as uniform as possible.
Put a little more gold dust
in each bag, John.
When you finish loading, nail down
the false lid and start loading sacks.
Yes, sir.
Pack the flour a little harder
around each bag, Mrs. Carter.
Double-bottom wagons and flour sacks,
they were smart ideas.
IRBY:
I just hope it works.
- I guess that's the last of it.
- That's all for this wagon.
One more load will take care of the rest.
MAN 2:
Gill, 50, Picket, 45, Talbot, 70, Parrish, 85.
- How much do you figure the lot, Cameron?
- Just a shade over 5 million.
Five million into 1200 miles,
that's our next problem.
- You can do it, Irby, if anybody can.
- Let's hope.
Listen, everybody.
If everything goes right,
we'll be able to start within 48 hours.
Pack your wagons, but keep out of sight.
All of you know what's expected of you.
It'll be a hard and dangerous journey,
even if we escape the Union soldiers.
And for all outward purposes we are an
immigrant train headed for California...
...with our wives and children. Once we're
out of town, the rest is up to me.
We've got to watch ourselves
every minute from now on.
One slip, just one, and we're goners.
Not only for us, but for the South,
remember that.
And one thing more.
When you leave here, don't go together.
It might give some bright Yank an idea.
MAN 3:
I value this about $30.
And the name is Tom...
I think you're on the wrong track, sir...
...but I've completed the list of what
you term "copperheads" or "rebels."
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
And here it is:
"John Armistead, Thomas A. Marshall,
Dr. Robert Cameron, Frank Gaylord."
Et cetera, et cetera.
Fifteen or 20 of them.
All reputable citizens.
I see. Thanks.
Well, my understanding is that Virginia City
has mined 48 millions in gold...
...since the war started.
The Comstock ran most of it, I know that.
We've got a record of their activities.
That still leaves
a considerable amount unaccounted.
Apparently the property of these men.
Your information is approximately correct.
These people
have had accounts in this bank.
Have had? Haven't they still?
No, only one or two small accounts.
Being Southerners,
they were afraid of confiscation.
- Yes.
- And frankly, I don't blame them.
No.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
So this gold's back in their possession,
is it?
Safely hidden away until the war's over.
But they're all friends of mine,
I'm not afraid. They'll bring it back.
Well, I wouldn't count too much on that
if I were you, sir.
- How's that?
- I said, to your health, sir.
Oh, yes.
To yours, to yours, by all means, sir.
By the way, I don't see the name
of Haynes on this list.
- Haynes?
- Yes, Haynes or Hayne.
I thought they might be
depositors of yours.
No, never heard of them.
Sure that's the right name?
Frankly, I'm not sure
of anything these days, sir.
You see some incredible mirages
in the desert.
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, thanks for the information, sir.
Not at all, sir. It's been a pleasure.
MAN: Step this way, folks,
to the door of rum, riches and rapture.
The one and only famous Sazerac Saloon,
known from Philly to Frisco.
See the Living Lily,
the only person ever framed in the Sazerac.
She inhales, she exhales.
She does everything but talk,
and she is liable to do that.
Just look on the inside, folks.
See and hear the most beautiful girls
that ever escaped from a female seminary.
Let's go in and mix around.
Keep your eyes and ears open.
- Don't get into trouble, don't get drunk.
- He don't think we'd do anything...
...wasn't pious, does he?
MARBLEHEAD: Well, I hope not.
Let's mosey over here.
Something might turn up.
- Well, well, hello, stranger.
- Something did.
- True enough.
WOMAN: How about trying your luck?
- I got a lot of luck and it's all bad.
- The old guessing contest.
Pays one, two and three for one.
Three winners and losers.
There she goes.
Going like a boll weevil in a cotton patch.
Like taking a gal to a picnic, you don't
know whether you're gonna bring her back.
We got a winner.
Just a minute, mister.
What will it be, mister?
What will you have?
What? Oh, anything, and make it double.
- Kind of took your mind off your business?
- Yes.
What's her name?
Julie Adams.
How long has she been working here?
BARTENDER:
Three, nearly four years.
She just got back from St. Louis.
The boys certainly did miss her.
I'll bet they did.
- You're wonderful!
- Hey, I'm not that good.
- Take care. Have a nice trip.
- Hi, Julia.
Julia, you're a nice kid.
- Fine. When are you leaving?
- Tomorrow.
JULIA: Oh, you are? Well, good luck.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- You're all right.
- You're a beauty.
JULIA: Thank you.
- Baby, you were marvelous.
- I'm not that good.
MAN 1: Come on, darling.
MAN 2: Raise your glass.
Good evening.
Oh, Kerry.
Well, hello.
This is a surprise.
How do you like Virginia City?
I haven't made up my mind yet.
But I can see Virginia City likes you.
This is very funny.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
I didn't think it would matter so much.
At least I hoped it wouldn't.
Why, I don't know that it does.
It puts quite a burden on faith, though.
Enough faith could carry it.
These people like me and respect me
and they discourage those who don't.
- That's very nice arrangement.
- Yes.
Tell me, would it help your percentage any
if I bought you a drink?
I'm paid to be pleasant to everybody.
Everybody?
Yes. Why not?
That's right. Why not?
Come on, let me get you a drink.
Hey, bartender.
- Kerry said for you not to get drunk.
- Yeah.
Fill it up.
I wonder what she'd do
if we had another drink.
Finest west of the Mississippi.
Here you are, pal.
I hope you're right.
BARTENDER:
Look, Johnny.
All right.
Well, well.
It's a small world, isn't it?
I didn't know you
for a minute, Bradford.
Maybe it's the fresh air in here.
What are you doing out here in Nevada?
Now, there's a coincidence.
I was just going to ask you
the same thing.
I caught a minié ball at Cedar Creek.
Gangrene set in,
so they shipped me back home.
Tough luck.
How do you feel now?
Not too bad.
You look fine.
You know, we often talk about you,
my friends and I.
MAN: Down, boys.
- We just done...
That's Irby.
I'll be doggoned if it ain't.
This is a quite reunion.
We can have a drink on it.
That's a good idea.
Only this time, the treat's on me.
Same thing. Oh, excuse me.
This is Captain Irby, Miss Julia...
Miss... Don't tell me,
I'll have it in a minute.
That's funny, who would've thought
I could've forgotten that?
- You forget easily, don't you?
- Maybe.
- How do you do, captain?
- It's a pleasure, ma'am.
- Am I interrupting?
- No, not at all.
Captain Irby's an old friend. As a matter
of fact, we once shared the same roof.
Any friend of Mr. Bradford
is a friend of mine.
I'm glad you're joining us. You know
how it is: more drinks, more percentage.
Yeah.
- To the belle of the Sazerac.
- To you both.
Virginia City seems to be quite
a Union stronghold, ma'am.
- Yes, it's red, white and blue all over.
- All over?
Of course there are a few
copperheads here, but they're harmless.
What do you think, Irby?
I agree with the lady.
What harm could a few Southerners
do way out here?
Hey, there's a couple fellows
at the end of the bar...
...wants you to have a drink with them.
Well, if you'll excuse me.
It's been a great pleasure
meeting you again, sir.
The pleasure's all mine, sir.
- Hi, fellas.
- How are you? Have a drink.
Thank you. To you.
- Don't look, but you know who that is?
- Recognize him?
- It's Irby.
- Yeah.
Of course I recognize him.
What's he doing out here?
I don't know, but I imagine
he's on the same business as we are.
Where did you meet him?
He came west on the stagecoach
with me from St. Louis.
Why?
He was one of my prisoners at Libby
for eight months.
Stay away from him. Don't let him
question you, he's a Union spy.
A pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
Thank you.
- You ain't gonna let him get away, Kerry.
- No.
He's liable to be halfway
to Texas before daylight.
No. He'll be just where we want him.
Ain't that your music, Miss Julie?
Hey, that's the gal that was on the...
- You don't say?
- Yeah. Ain't it, Moose?
Sure looks like her.
It's Irby.
- Tom, John.
- What's up?
I just left the Sazerac.
There's a Union spy in town named Bradford
who knows me and knows why I'm here.
Has he seen you yet?
Get a word to Topp and Parrish
and warn the others. I'll see Dr. Cameron.
Hurry and get the lid down.
Load this wagon.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
What can I do for you?
Working late for a blacksmith, aren't you?
Yep. Can I do anything for you?
Somebody came in the shop.
It's Bradford, 10-to-1. No.
Pile this stuff in the wagons.
Drive them to Box Canyon, tell the first
three parties to go there and wait.
- Are you going there now?
- I'm going to re-enter the shop.
That may stall them
until we can clear this room.
There's something going on here
that don't meet the eye.
Looking for something?
Where's the man
that just went in there?
What man?
Ain't nobody been in here but you.
- You're lying.
- Hold on, young fella.
I ain't used to being talked to that way.
Sounds like a bunch of church bells.
Hey, quit that pounding, will you?
I'd have bet my doggone life
he'd come in here.
BRADFORD: Which one of you is Gaylord?
- Me.
Why?
Do you know a man named Irby?
Were you looking for me?
Yes, among other things.
Well, if I can help you in any way.
BRADFORD:
You have already.
I'm afraid I don't...
Oh, yes, I remember now.
We once made an appointment, didn't we?
Well, gentlemen,
I'm still at your service.
Yes, but I don't want you alone, Irby.
I knew as soon as you left,
you'd come to your friends.
You're the leader of these men.
You can surrender...
...or watch us pull this place apart.
- I don't know what you're talking about...
I want you, your friends
and that gold you came here for.
- Have you any idea what he means?
- Search me, mister.
That's just what I'm gonna do.
- Moose, Marble.
- Yeah?
BRADFORD: Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Dadgum right, I'm all right.
BRADFORD:
Come over here.
I think I've got something.
MARBLEHEAD:
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Well, Mr. Irby.
Moose,
go as quickly as you can to Drewery.
Tell him to block every street corner
and passage with mounted troops.
MOOSE:
What we need now is action, Kerry.
Sit down, Vance. What's the matter?
- It looks like we're up against a stone wall.
- What's happened?
They got the city patrolled and every street
blocked. They're searching every house.
Have they caught any of us?
Marshall, Gill, Pickett, Topp and Parrish.
About 15 others caught and threatened.
You may be next. That's why I came here
to warn you to burn our maps now, quick.
All right.
What about the gold?
It's in the wagons and they're safe.
For a few hours anyway.
Burn these, will you?
I'll get the rest.
What are your plans?
I don't know yet.
They may get me, but that isn't important.
The thing is, how to get this gold
out of town past those guards.
Wait in there.
Here, take my coat.
All right. I'm coming.
Are you Doc Cameron?
Yes. What do you want?
Anybody else in here?
Yes, a patient. I'm busy.
That can wait.
Oh, Murrell.
You should remember, doctor...
...it is not the first time I am here.
Whoever you got in that other room,
tell him to come out.
- Oh, what is it, doctor?
- Well, it looks as if he's been...
Nothing.
Don't worry.
It's just to fix my arm.
Why do we wait?
Do something for me, quick.
All right.
Bring him in here.
Will you help, Vance?
Marshall, Robert Gill, Cameron...
All right, you two take Dr. Cameron.
I'll see Armistead.
That, I think, just about takes care
of every Southerner here. Go ahead.
All right.
MURRELL: Hey, look out, doc.
You hurt a little bit I don't care.
Next time you get a bullet wound, better
not try to cauterize it with gunpowder.
It worked pretty good for a snake bite.
Then it should've worked for you...
...but it didn't.
It's a good joke, huh?
You. You know me, who I am?
Yes, I know you, Murrell.
You used to be in Morgan's cavalry.
You've got a gang together now,
not far away from here.
Yeah.
I hope you are not thinking
about collecting this reward.
No, I'm thinking of one you can collect.
You, see who is there.
If he's smart man, get rid of him.
Get over there, you.
Are you Doc Cameron?
Yes. Why? Anything wrong?
We can't tell from here.
Who you got in there?
A patient with a smashed shoulder.
If you've got any business,
it'll have to wait. This man can't.
Just a second, doc.
- Can't we take a look?
- What for?
Gosh, I ain't never seen
a operation before. Doggone.
CAMERON: What do you fools think this is?
A sideshow?
Maybe a man who's bleeding to death
doesn't mean much to you...
...but he does to me.
- Just a second, doc.
There ain't no cause for you to go
and getting all riled up.
No. You'll got yourself so excited,
you'll cut him up the wrong way.
I had the measles once.
You don't operate on no measles,
you big lummox.
Thank you, doc. That was nice work.
You lie almost so good like me, huh?
But nobody knows I am in Virginia City.
Who are they looking for?
They're looking for me, Murrell.
- For you?
- Yeah.
We are in the same boat, huh?
And maybe we can pull together.
Maybe. What you mean?
I'll give you $ 10,000 to do a job for me.
What kind of job?
Listen, here's what I want you to do.
On the west side of the city
is the Union garrison...
Oh, you.
Well, did you come back to tell me
how much you liked the act?
No. No, I came back to ask you
if you'd forgive me for...
For being disappointed in me?
Well, I suppose you couldn't help it.
No, it wasn't that.
But it was such a surprise
seeing you up there.
If things had been
the other way around, you'd...
I couldn't imagine you
out there dancing the cancan.
That's a funny thought.
I'd probably get mixed up in my skirts.
- You know what I mean, though, don't you?
- Yes, I know.
But you see, Kerry,
no matter how much a man's in love...
...he really wonders whether the woman's
quite good enough for him or not.
But when a woman's in love, well,
she's just in love and that's the end of it.
You see,
if you'd told me everything at first, l...
Have you told me everything?
No, I haven't. You're right.
I just made a silly fool of myself.
I'm sorry.
Will you forgive me?
I forgave you a long time ago.
Maybe...
Maybe I even wanted you
to care that much.
That's all I wanted to know.
In case anything should happen to me,
I just wanted to be sure of that.
You're in some kind of danger,
aren't you, Kerry?
Well, Virginia City's a dangerous place.
Besides, there's a war on and...
Yes, there's a war on.
- Could I see you for a moment, sir?
- Yes.
Excuse me. What is it?
Someone reported they saw Irby around
the rear door of the Sazerac a half-hour ago.
Good, we'll take a look around.
Wait here.
- I'll be right with you.
- Yes, sir.
Is that why you came here?
I can't tell you about it now, darling.
But I want you to know this,
I do love you...
...and that's the most important thing
in the world.
Remember that always, will you?
IRBY:
Close that door.
Vance.
Lock it.
Why did you risk coming here?
Bradford's downstairs now looking for you.
Yes, I saw him. He found the hideout. Every
street leading out of town is blocked...
...with soldiers but we're going tomorrow
night and the gold is going with us.
But how can we?
Remember Murrell, the outlaw?
I made a deal with him.
His gang is camped
a few miles from here.
Between 2 and 3 tomorrow night,
they'll attack the garrison.
That'll draw every soldier
out of Virginia City.
When they arrive,
we slip out of town with the four wagons.
The others will be up in Box Canyon
waiting for us.
Waiting for us?
But you can't stay here now, Julia.
Or would you rather stay?
Why, I have nothing to stay for, Vance.
Of course I'm going with you.
There's just one other thing
left to be done, Julia...
...but it's the most important,
and you are the only one who can do it.
What is it, Vance?
Get in touch with Bradford, tell him you
know where I'm hiding and send him to me.
Send him to you? What for?
He's the one man in Virginia City
who could stop us.
The moment he saw us start, he'd arouse
a posse to grab us and the gold.
The only way to stop that
is to grab him first.
What are you going to do with him,
Vance?
I don't know yet.
You're going to kill him, aren't you?
Of course you are.
You couldn't afford to leave him here alive,
he knows too much about us.
So I must lead him quietly and unsuspecting
to his death because I'm a woman.
That's something only a woman could do.
Why, all of this was your idea, Julia.
Taking the gold from here.
Remember the look
on Jefferson Davis' face when he said:
"We are very proud of you
and deeply grateful"?
I remember.
"And the hopes of 10 million of us
will be riding with you."
I remember.
That's why your decision right now
is so important.
Oh, but why must I be the one, Vance?
Can't you see this is murder?
It's even worse than murder,
Kerry trusts me.
And what about those
who are trusting us?
When these people leave
with their children...
...they're turning their backs
on their homes.
Some of them are facing death
and they know it, but not one hesitates.
Yes.
I know what this means to you, Julia...
...but there's no alternative,
you are the only one who can do it.
What shall I tell him?
Now, listen...
All right, we'll spread out from here.
Moose, you take the north section.
You men check everything up that way.
Come on, Marble, we'll look around here.
By golly. Ain't a man got time
to get a little grog around here?
You're groggy enough, partner. Wait here.
How do you do? I understand
this is a boarding house, is that correct?
- We're filled up.
- Well, thanks. I wasn't looking for a room...
...I was looking for a boarder.
Mind telling me who your guests are?
That's their business. I never ask them.
- Well, would you mind if I looked around?
- You can take a look at this.
I'll have no yellow-livered Yankee
in my house unless it's a dead one.
And I got a twitchy finger, so get.
Well, do you still want to argue?
No, ma'am. I never argue with women.
And certainly not a woman with a gun.
I'd do something for that twitchy finger
if I were you...
...it even makes me nervous. Good day.
So the Union forces retreat, huh?
Yes, sir. The third battle of Bull Run.
MAN: Hey, come back here,
you little ragamuffin.
Here he is, sergeant.
COBBY:
Let me go.
- Answer my questions and I'll let you go.
- I can't tell you anything.
You know every rebel in town,
you run errands for them. Where's Irby?
- I don't know and I wouldn't tell if I did.
SERGEANT: You're lying.
- I'll wail that tar out if you don't talk.
COBBY: Go ahead, you're big enough.
Hold on, sergeant. Let the kid alone.
- Yes, but...
- I said, let him alone.
Come on, partner.
We're not fishing
for Southerners your size.
Yeah, well, I was fishing for you.
- Miss Julia sent me to find you.
- She did?
- What are you fellas butting in for?
- What?
If I had my way, I'd whip that little
copperhead until he couldn't stand up.
If you don't find her on the stage,
you'll find her in her dressing room.
I see.
- Thanks. Here's something for your trouble.
- No, thanks, I don't want it.
Hey, you don't like Yankees much,
do you?
No, I don't.
Well, I think I know how you feel.
When I was a boy in Ireland,
I felt the same way about Englishmen.
But you can change.
Well, thanks all the same.
So long.
Come in.
- Darling, did you send for me?
- Yes.
- The boy said it was urgent.
- It is.
Come over here, Kerry,
and sit down by me.
What is it?
Oh, I'm worried about you.
Half of Virginia City knows who you are
and why you're here.
Why didn't you tell me?
Well, it's part of my job
not to talk too much.
- I would have told you at the right time.
- Oh, there'll never be a right time.
I know these Southern people,
I've lived among them.
They'll kill you
before they'd give up their gold.
You can hardly blame them for trying.
But they're gonna have
to improve their aim first.
You mustn't go on with the search.
Please. For my sake.
But I must go on with it.
This job's gotta be finished.
But what can you, one man,
hope to accomplish against hundreds?
You can't stop them, Kerry,
the whole Union Army can't stop them.
I love you, darling.
I'm so afraid for you.
I love you too, Julia.
But I won't run out
and leave them a clear field here.
I couldn't do it. Don't you see?
This means too much
to too many people.
Does it mean more than...?
Than you and me?
It's the only thing that does.
All right, if that's your decision.
I'm sorry, darling.
I want to help you.
I can tell you where to find their leader.
- Who? Irby?
- Yes.
He's in love with one of the girls here.
She saw him less than an hour ago.
- Where is she? Where can I talk to her?
- She'd be afraid to talk to you.
She said that Irby's ready to make a deal,
give himself up tonight if you come alone.
- Then he must know he's beaten.
- Yes.
Where is he?
There will be someone here tonight
to take you to him.
I see.
How do you know you can trust that girl?
She wouldn't lie to me.
She knows I love you
and what your life means to me.
Darling, that's enough for me.
Goodbye.
Tell Carson City to watch the south road,
stop all travelers, hold for identification...
- What happened?
- It's a raid. About 50 of them.
- We don't know who they are.
- Looks like Murrell and his men.
Close the gates, mount the parapets,
a hundred rounds to each man.
We only have a skeleton force,
the rest are on patrol.
Burke, go and get them,
bring them back as fast as you can.
Lieutenant, assemble what men we have.
We'll hold them off
until the reinforcements come.
Wayne...
- There it is.
- Oh, wait a minute.
Well, what are you two bloodhounds
trailing me around for?
We wasn't trailing you.
We was kind of moseying around
sort of accidental like and here we are.
- I don't need you, get out of here.
- We thought it would...
- Sure. You know, just in case...
- Oh.
All right, wait here.
I'll be back in 15 minutes.
Here it is, sir.
The door's unlocked,
he's in there waiting for you.
Oh, thanks.
Irby?
- You alone, Bradford?
- Yes.
I got your message.
What is it you want?
There isn't much I can expect, is there?
Not much more than you gave me
in Libby Prison.
So now you're gonna collect
for that tunnel?
I'm gonna have to collect
much more than that, Irby.
There can be no deal before you,
your friends and their gold...
...have been put safely away
until this war's over.
Even then I can't guarantee
that they won't hang you as a spy.
You Yanks
always did drive a hard bargain.
But this time I have an idea
we're going to trade on my terms.
Really? What might they be?
I prefer your company
to your life, captain.
I had quite an argument about that
with my friends, but I finally won out.
Don't move your hands and turn slowly.
I hated to do it this way,
but you had to know sometime...
...and tonight you moved
a little too fast for us.
You're going back home with us,
an escaped prisoner of the Confederacy...
...back to Libby to lower-west
and the sentence you ran away from.
I see.
Well, this was a very clever little trap.
Some consolation to think
I'm not the first man...
...who was ever fooled by a woman.
But you haven't got a chance
of getting out of this town, Irby.
There's a squad of cavalry on every corner
and they'd shoot you down on sight.
I only came here to give you a chance.
I took my chance
and we won't have to wait much longer.
Fall in. Column of twos.
Back to the garrison.
Tie him up, we gotta move fast.
Bring him along.
Where do you suppose they're off to?
Hey, ain't them 15 minutes about up?
- They sure are.
- Well...
- Kerry!
- Hey, Kerry!
- Kerry!
- Hey!
It's locked.
Kerry.
- Kerry. Hey, Kerry.
- Kerry.
- Kerr...
- Well, he ain't here.
You don't reckon that sawbones
operated on Kerry, do you?
What are you talking about?
MAN 1:
Boys, we're ready.
MAN 2:
Wagons, forward!
Watch your wheels, boys,
sandy territory ahead.
Bradford, I'll make a bargain with you.
From now on,
it's gonna be a rough trail and hard riding.
If you give me your word
you won't escape, I'll untie you.
Well, thanks, Irby.
I think we'd better leave things
the way they are.
I don't wanna make a promise
that I might not be able to keep.
Suit yourself.
Kerry.
I'm sorry this had to happen.
Sorry? What for?
Everything turned out
the way you planned it, didn't it?
It was the last thing in the world
I wanted to do.
Well, you're the only one in the world
who could have done it.
Boy, if your smeller can pick out
a wagon track on them rocks...
...you ought to have been born
a bloodhound.
Shucks, I can trace a fly
across that dirty neck of yours.
Look.
Come here.
Well, them sure ain't rabbit tracks.
Be dadgummed
if them ain't wheel tracks.
Yes, sir,
and that's the way we're heading.
- Well, I don't know.
- Well, I do know.
This way of passing,
they must be ahead of us.
What makes you so confounded
certain he's with that outfit?
If he ain't with them,
he's after them.
Did you know Kerry to turn aside
from something he started after?
No, but you...
Marblehead,
I only made one mistake in my life...
...and that was when I started
letting you follow after me.
- Come on.
- Well, let's get to riding.
Wagons, ho.
Nice work, Murrell.
- Did you lose any men?
- Oh, maybe five or six.
Big party you got here.
Yeah.
Here it is, Murrell. All ready for you.
Pretty big price you pay to get
this wagon train out of Virginia City.
Not when you're anxious to get home.
MURRELL: Which way you heading?
IRBY: Due south.
MURRELL: Yeah, that's the best way.
Better you cut west this side of Las Vegas.
Then you miss the Union outpost
at Mormon Station.
You cross the Colorado River at...
Yeah.
Just like I said...
...you cross the river at Sloan's Ferry.
The water, she's low this time of year.
Maybe you like
I ride a little ways with you, huh?
- No, thanks.
- Well, good luck.
Maybe I see you sometime.
That was a good tip
about circling Mormon Station.
A little too good.
But we're taking no chances
with Mr. Murrell.
Wagons, forward.
Sergeant, wagon train coming.
If only our luck holds out.
Marshall, you and Armistead ride back...
...and tell the boys to act natural
and keep Bradford out of sight.
SERGEANT:
Pull up.
Pull up, everybody.
Hello, sergeant.
- Hi.
MAN 1: Pull up, everybody.
MAN 2:
Hold back, boys. Hold back.
Where'd you folks come from?
All the way from Kansas,
heading for California.
Is this the right road?
It might be.
What do you got in that wagon?
Oh, some grub, a few pieces of furniture
and a lot of tired people.
SERGEANT: Well, you got a long pull
ahead of you.
You'll find some mighty dry country.
Excuse me, folks.
- And that one?
- Same as the rest, we're settlers.
You're welcome to look, but I assure you
there's nothing there to interest the Army.
All right, go ahead.
Thanks, sergeant.
Wagons, forward!
Hold on a minute.
- Pull up, you men.
- Hold those wagons.
IRBY:
Any trouble, sergeant?
What makes these wagons sink so deep?
You ain't declared that hefty a load.
Why, it's the wagon itself.
Besides, your country's pretty sandy.
Maybe, but I'm gonna
have a look just the same.
All right, everybody,
get out of those wagons.
Come on, you too.
We're unloading everything.
MAN: Come on, get moving.
Get those wagons out.
He can't get far. Come on.
Cobby.
That's the last of him.
Go back to the wagons and keep rolling.
- Mormon Station, sir.
- Yeah?
"Gold train...
...passed through here...
...after killing guard.
Send force immediately...
...equipped for long..."
Well?
Something's happened, sir.
Push them hands up
and reach for the roof.
Doggone it.
Say, you're sure getting so you play rough.
You knowed that was me.
- What do you mean trying to scare us?
- Well, I'm sorry, fellas.
I had no idea it was you
until you fell on your faces.
Well, that's a fine welcome.
It would have served you right
if I'd plugged you.
Where have you been?
- What took you so long?
- We been following...
What do you mean wandering around
like a couple of strays?
Do I have to put bells on you
to find out where you are?
- Well, l...
- Be quiet.
I can't depend on you any longer,
I can see that.
Serve you right
if I knocked your bone-heads together.
- Oh, Kerry, it sure is good to see you.
- You bet.
My, how you two have grown.
- How'd you find me?
- We got a couple of good smellers.
- I'll say you have.
- We followed your trail. What's this?
MARBLEHEAD:
Somebody's been cutting up around here.
BRADFORD:
That's the gold train.
- Boy, I'm sure glad you're all together.
- I'm only just.
It's coming through now, sir.
"Will wait...
...here for you.
Captain Bradford."
- Order the assembly.
- Yes, sir.
Intelligence Department. Bradford.
- You drivers all set?
- We're all ready.
After you cross the river,
turn toward Mojave City.
Should make fast time with these wagons,
but be sure and leave a clear trail.
Good luck, boys. Now, get going.
Hurry, we gotta catch those wagons
before they leave the river.
Right, Vance.
All right, folks, we're moving.
If we move the boy another mile,
it might kill him.
If we don't move on,
it may be all of us.
Won't you let us rest here today, Vance,
for a few hours?
We can't chance it, Julia.
Sorry, Cobby,
we can't stand by and let you rest.
I'll be all right.
Just keep on moving, Vance.
All right, we'll put him in the wagon.
Murrell said there was nothing
to worry about after Sloan's Crossing.
I said I don't trust Murrell.
I'm dividing the train.
We don't know who's behind us
or how close, so let's hurry.
All right, Vance.
All right, keep your wagons close together
till we get to the middle of the river.
Whoa.
- This is evidently where they camped.
- Dad-burned if it ain't.
There are the tracks
where they crossed the river.
We'll pick them up on the other side.
There's where they went out.
And they headed due south.
It couldn't be plainer if they'd left a map.
That's just it, sir.
How far can you trust that map?
They knew they were being followed.
Be the easiest thing in the world
to cover those tracks up.
- Lf you want my opinion...
- I'd ask for it.
You saw the trail where they went in.
And this is where they went out.
I should think even an Intelligence officer
would see that.
MAN:
Forward, ho.
COBBY: Julia, how much farther
do we have to go?
Not far, Cobby.
We're almost there.
Shh. Don't try to talk.
You go back to sleep.
My stomach.
Wagons ahead, sir.
Whoa.
There are only four wagons,
you told me there were 10.
There are still 10.
Ho!
There ain't nothing in this one.
It's emptier than his head.
Doggone, thunderation.
Major, the confounding stuff
sure ain't in there.
Bradford, if this idea of yours
turns out to be a wild-goose chase...
These wagons are just decoys, sir.
They purposely led us off the trail.
Loaded the gold into the other six...
...they must be ahead of us,
either south or southeast.
Well, how about the north and the west?
We haven't tried them yet.
Since we don't seem to agree...
...I wonder if you'd mind if I took men
and followed my hunch?
You could divide the rest up into patrols
and spread out.
- We could rendezvous at Sloan's Crossing.
- Well, all right.
But I hope your hunch
turns out to be a good one, for your sake.
Thank you, sir. I do too.
Walton and five men,
join Captain Bradford.
Lieutenant, call the troops.
Circle in.
We're camping here.
Circle in.
His pulse is very weak.
Let me.
He needs fresh water, Vance.
So do the rest of us.
We'll make the water hole tomorrow
if we're lucky.
There's the river. Water.
MAN:
This is the river we hoped for.
Mud.
How far to the next stream, Vance?
If this one's dry, they all are.
We mustn't let the others know.
Means too much to them.
We'll tell them it's a mistake,
that this isn't the place.
We haven't reached it yet.
You go back to the wagons, John,
and tell them.
Come on.
Go back to your wagons, men.
There's been a mistake.
I'm afraid we'll have to go further on.
I want to talk.
I know what you've been going through.
It's worse for you than the rest. You've got
the responsibility of all these people.
I've got a job to do.
I know.
They've been through so much already,
all of them.
Julia, you don't regret anything, do you?
Regret?
- What do you mean?
- You've changed.
You've been different ever since...
Tell me, what's on your mind?
Oh, it's just these people,
they can't go on.
- We can't make them, Vance, it's inhuman.
- War is inhuman, Julia.
We're going on, just as long
as we have the strength to go on.
How many days will that be
without food and water? Two, maybe three?
There's nothing but desert
between here and Texas.
That doesn't matter.
We're just a few. Thousands will suffer
if we fail. We gotta get through.
Come on, Julia, we're moving. Come on.
MOOSE:
"Cobby Gill, age 11."
It must have been pretty tough for him.
For one of them, especially.
You sure was right
about that gold train, Kerry.
That's the way they're headed, all right.
Walton, Brown.
- Yes, sir.
- Ride back to Major Drewery's camp.
- Tell him to follow us as quickly as he can.
- Yes, sir.
They started out with 10 wagons,
now they only have four.
Whatever money they got is in those four,
that's a cinch.
I figured we'd run onto them about here.
You figured? Didn't I tell you?
Yes, I've often wondered
what I'd do without you two.
You see?
Who's that?
Dismount.
MARBLEHEAD:
I'll be doggoned.
Take these horses
and keep them out of sight.
Tarnation.
That bunch is all tired. Wore out.
Maybe we give them little surprise, huh?
The rest of you stay here
and keep them covered.
MAN: Bed down your horses
and start your fires.
WOMAN:
Watch the children.
Hold on, Murrell.
- Hello.
- What do you want here?
I have some business to talk with Irby.
He's finished his business with you.
Maybe he thinks so, but not me.
For the fine service I have given him,
two little bags of gold is not enough.
You named your price and we paid it.
Now, get out of here.
I think maybe you tell Irby
I want to talk with him, huh?
It's Murrell.
Doggone, tarnation.
It's the Yank, Bradford.
Hold your fire, men. Let them come in.
Don't shoot at them. Hold your fire.
- Thanks, Irby.
- Forget it.
This turned into a pretty good fracas.
Yeah.
How'd you learn to wing-shoot?
In Afghanistan, the kids do it.
- How much ammunition have you got?
- Plenty.
Vance!
- Oh, Vance.
- Let's get his shirt open.
Yes.
That's a bad one. Dr. Cameron?
IRBY: Bradford?
- Yes.
You take command, will you?
- Right. Don't worry.
- Yes.
Get him comfortable, doctor.
CAMERON: We'll get him on a cot.
- Vance.
- That's right.
- Julia.
Come over here. Follow me, quick.
Come on.
Now, line up shoulder to shoulder.
Now, hold your fire.
And when they get close,
let them have a little volley.
All right.
If I ever get my hands
on that cow-hided Murrell again...
...l'll make him squall like a mashed cat.
BRADFORD:
Once more.
Now, we hold off until daylight.
And when the sun comes up,
we finish off this wagon train pretty quick.
Better build that barricade higher.
Get a little sleep if you can, Vance.
Thanks, doc.
Too bad, Irby.
I'm sorry.
I was hoping you'd come.
What's our chance of holding out?
Not much, frankly.
As soon as daylight comes
they'll be down on us again.
Our only hope's Drewery.
When?
Tomorrow, maybe. Maybe not for days.
About the gold...
It's cost us so much.
If any of us gets through...
...l'd like it to do some good.
So would l, but that's not up to me.
What happens to the gold,
that's out of my hands.
No, it isn't.
It was your job to get us and you did it.
Anyway, the South can't win now,
but the gold still belongs to our people.
After the war, they'll need it to help
thousands like them throughout the South.
I thought because of Julia, you might...
I told you, whatever happens to the gold
is not up to me.
I promise you one thing, though.
Murrell won't get it.
But if Drewery...
That's all I can promise.
Where is it?
Under the floorboards of the wagons.
Right.
Too bad you and I had to be
on opposite sides of the fence in this.
I think we might have been friends.
Thanks.
Marble.
Moose.
How is he?
How's Irby?
Oh, he's pretty bad, poor fella.
I don't think he'll make it.
- He told me where the gold is.
- Where?
- Under the floorboards of the wagons.
- Well, I'll be.
Look, get every able-bodied men in camp.
Get all of that gold
into the first wagon there.
And speed it up,
we've only got two hours till dawn.
Boys, come on.
You two men go with them.
- Dr. Cameron?
- Yes, what is it?
- How much gunpowder have we got?
- Kegs of it.
Get out two kegs and a length of fuse.
- What are you trying to do?
- We're moving the gold.
What for? What are you gonna do with it?
I haven't time for explanations now.
CAMERON: So you're taking the gold
and running out on us?
- I'm afraid I misjudged you, Bradford.
- Did you?
Well, look, doctor,
you take care of the wounded...
...and I'll worry about the rest, huh?
Come on. Here, hitch this horse up.
- Who told you where the gold was?
- Irby.
- You'd better go to him, Julia.
- Vance wouldn't trust you.
You've tricked him and now you plan
to use us to take what's still ours.
Oh, I'd rather Murrell got it
than the North.
I don't use those people who trust me.
In any case, this time tomorrow none of us
will care who has the gold or where it is...
...because we probably won't be alive.
There'll be a certain rough justice
about that.
What do you know about justice?
What do you know...?
I'm sorry we don't understand each other,
Julia.
- Come on.
MOOSE: We're all loaded, Kerry.
BRADFORD:
All right, Marble, you take the lines.
Now, the rest of you men, get
on those wheels and start the load rolling.
Don't let her sink in the sand. Come on.
Bring the wagon nearer,
close under that ledge as possible.
Now, unhitch the horses
and get them out of there.
Right, one more keg.
Now, the fuse.
There it is. Come on.
Doggone scissor-bills, here they come again.
Thicker than hair on a dog's back.
I got him for you, Yank.
Father.
Father.
Why, you...
You dirty rat.
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
They killed him. They killed him.
Think it's gonna rain?
It always does.
Here. Hold this.
Follow me...
They ain't shooting. Watch them fall.
Vance.
DREWERY:
How many men did you lose?
What you see here is all that's left, sir.
DREWERY:
Is the gold safe?
Well, where is it? Let's have a look at it.
There isn't any gold.
DREWERY: Is this your idea of a joke,
Bradford? Answer my question.
Have you searched the wagons?
I told you, sir, there isn't any gold.
Why, that's absurd.
Do you think I followed you
hundreds of miles to believe this lie?
What have you done with it?
Who are you holding it for?
Just a minute, Bradford.
Yes, sir.
You're under arrest.
Get your belongings together,
we're taking you back to Virginia City.
It is the verdict of this court martial...
...that you seized and withheld contraband
of war for private reasons...
...and are therefore guilty of high treason.
Before final sentence is passed...
...is there anything else
you wish to say in your defense?
Yes, sir,
there is something I'd like to add.
It's true I took the gold...
...and I'm the only one responsible
for taking it...
...but not for the reasons the court infers.
The court is willing
to consider any reason...
...consistent with your obligations
as a soldier.
There are some things that aren't covered
by the military code, sir.
This was one of them.
You came here, not as a private citizen...
...but as an officer
with an official duty to perform.
And I performed it,
to the best of my ability.
My job was to see
that the gold didn't reach the South.
I knew that if it did, it'd prolong the war.
The gold did not reach the South.
That was not enough.
It was also your duty to hand it over
as contraband to your government.
That's true, sir.
I had a choice to make...
...a choice between doing my duty
as a soldier or as a man.
Well, I made that choice. I couldn't
very well have done anything else...
...after I saw what
those people went through...
...for a cause they believed to be right.
And what has this to do with you?
Their leader hoped that someday that gold
would still return to the South...
...where it belonged, to help them rebuild
their homes and restore some of their pride.
Continue.
I don't think I can explain it
any better than that, sir.
Except that I believe
I'm doing the right thing.
That's why I refused to deliver the gold.
That's why I still refuse.
Captain Bradford,
that's your final decision?
Yes, it is, sir.
It is the sentence of this court martial...
...that you shall be executed
on the morning of April the 9th, 1865...
...in the usual manner at the usual time
prescribed by regulations.
JULIA:
l... I can't tell you...
I've no words to...
Oh, I'm so deeply grateful
for this audience.
I know how busy you are, Mr. President.
I was afraid you wouldn't see me,
because I'm a Virginian.
Why, I've got a lot of friends down south,
Miss Hayne...
...and more relatives in Virginia
than a Blue Ridge rabbit.
I've sort of missed them
these last four years.
Mr. President,
the execution is set for tomorrow.
That's less than six hours in Nevada.
I've been studying the minutes
of the court martial, Miss Hayne.
According to military code,
there's no question of Bradford's guilt.
I know that, I heard them say so.
I was there.
Oh, but I beg you, Mr. President...
...judge him as a man
and not by military code.
He mustn't... He can't be killed.
I'm not a military man, my child.
He won't be killed.
Thank God that the killing is over.
Your General Lee is meeting
our General Grant tomorrow...
...at a place called Appomattox
Court House to discuss the terms of peace.
Then we've lost?
Not lost, found.
They're coming back, back in the Union.
Miss Hayne, you came over 2000 miles...
...to save the life of a man
who was once your enemy.
I think, very likely,
you're in love with him.
Well, to me, you two are symbols
of what I hope we can do for our country.
Mr. Lincoln,
I didn't know you were like this.
I want to tell them in Virginia,
everywhere.
Yes, tell them we're not enemies,
but friends.
That in my heart and in thousands like mine
throughout America...
...there is no spirit of revenge
in our victory.
There must be no harbor of hatred
in their defeat.
Tell them we are now one people,
united by blood and fire.
