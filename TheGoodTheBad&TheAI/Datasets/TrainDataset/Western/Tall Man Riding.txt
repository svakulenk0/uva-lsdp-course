Whoa.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Keep your head down.
Some of the young hotheads
among the settlers
tried to jump me.
What for?
It's the same old trouble
between the plowman
and the cattleman.
Anybody
from Warbonnet Ranch
isn't popular
around Little River.
Warbonnet?
What do they call you, mister?
Willard.
Rex Willard.
Tuck Ordway's
son-in-law.
You know Tuck?
Yeah, I know him.
Come on, we gotta get
outta here.
I don't remember ever seeing you
around here before.
Get up behind me.
Whoa.
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Warbonnet's gate
lies back this way.
I know it,
and they know it.
What if you were
in their boots
and lost a Warbonnet man
you were hunting?
Where would you go
to head him off?
You got me pegged
as an easterner,
a fool who can't think right
in this kind of country.
I didn't say it,
mister.
You did.
There's your fence line.
I'd like to know
your name.
In case you ever need
a friend, I--
Madden.
Larry Madden.
Just get this straight,
mister:
I hate your guts or anyone else
connected with Warbonnet.
I bought in before I knew
who you were,
but I'm glad I did, so's you
can tell Tuck Ordway I'm back.
You can tell her that too.
Whoa.
Some of that cloverleaf.
Five.
Hello, Larry.
Howdy.
What's it been, good luck or bad
since we last saw you?
Oh, a little
of both.
Been about three years,
huh, Larry?
Five.
Ames Luddington,
Larry Madden.
How do you do?
Very glad to know you.
I'm Reva.
Glad to know you,
miss.
Oh, yes, Reva.
I didn't mean
to neglect you, my dear.
I'm getting used
to it.
She sings here for Sebo.
Then I've got something
to look forward to.
It's nice to hear
a gentleman talk for a change.
SEBO:
How many?
AMES:
I'm good.
JEFF:
Two.
I see you did all right
for yourself, Jeff.
What do you mean?
Wearing that deputy doodad.
You must have been a big help
to Sebo to earn that.
You looking
for trouble, Larry?
You'll know when I am.
Ten.
Who's the slick kid
wearing out those coins?
Him?
He's the Peso Kid.
He's handy
to have around.
I'll bet he is, especially
with your back turned.
How 'bout sitting in,
Madden?
LARRY:
Too tired.
I'm going to the hotel
for the night.
Nothing's changed much.
You're even using the same
cheap-smelling toilet water.
You never did like that,
did you?
It'll never take the place
of a bath.
Good night,
gentlemen.
Reva.
Larry...
Have a drink.
It might interest you
to know
that we've got
the Warbonnet outfit on the run.
I'll believe that
when I can see it.
Old Tuck Ordway
hasn't showed his face
in Little River
for over a year.
Not only that,
there are homesteaders
located half the length
of the valley.
And I'll bet every one of 'em
paid you to locate the land,
to say nothing of what you can
squeeze out of 'em
in this whiskey mill.
I'm a businessman,
Larry.
If I can make it two ways
instead of one, all the better.
SEBO:
You got a stake?
LARRY:
What difference does it make?
I can use a rider
who can be frisky with a gun
when he needs to be.
I'll give you fighting pay
and found.
How 'bout it?
I'd sooner herd sheep.
We both carry the same marks,
Larry:
Ordway's marks.
That's the only thing
we've ever had in common.
Why should I tie in
with you?
At least I'd be more faithful
to you than...
Corinna was.
Not here.
Come in.
What'd he clip you for?
Oh, about $80,
I guess.
Reva wasn't standing behind you
just to stroke your hair.
I know. The best place to hear
things is at a poker game.
Looked at the register,
saw that you got in 10 days ago.
We left enough
spread between us
to keep anybody
from asking questions.
Okay,
let's have it.
Well, I had to go all the way
to Washington
to find that chink
in Tuck Ordway's armor
you were looking for.
I had to be a detective first
and a lawyer afterward.
What'd you find out?
Great news, Larry.
Better than I hoped for.
Ordway doesn't own an inch
of that land.
No, not legally.
What are you talking about?
His patent to the land is filed
in the Sentinel County records.
That's right.
But it was filed by
the county homestead committee,
and Washington doesn't recognize
the legality
of any of those committees.
Ordway thought he was safe,
but he didn't file
with Washington.
Then Warbonnet's actually
public domain, is that it?
Sure.
I spoke to a federal marshal
when I was back east,
and he said he'd throw Ordway
off the land
and open the land for filing.
Good work, Ames.
That means I'm set to get him
one way or the other.
What do you mean,
one way or another?
I wanna look at Tuck Ordway
through gun smoke first.
If I bring him down,
I don't need your marshal.
Uh, from what I hear,
there isn't a faster man
with a .45 than Tuck Ordway.
Suppose he brings you down,
what then?
You can send for that marshal
and have him throw Ordway off.
Alive or dead,
I mean to get him.
Why not get back at him,
make a profit out of it
at the same time?
I came back for Ordway's hide,
not his home.
What if Pearlo
should find out about this?
If he hasn't found out
about it yet,
he isn't going to,
not if you keep
your mouth shut.
I've waited five years
to get even,
pounding leather,
wrangling in four states,
to pile up enough money
to get a lawyer like you
to find out everything I could
to pay Ordway back...
in my own way.
Like you said,
you're paying me.
The man who pulls Tuck Ordway
down off of his rawhide throne
is going to be me.
MAN:
Who killed him?
MAN 2:
He said the Warbonnet gang
ambushed him.
Violent country.
One thing you never
told me, Larry:
why do you hate Ordway
so much?
I'll show you
something.
Pull this shirt down.
Holy...
How'd you like to be driven
down this street
with a man laying a whip
across your back?
Tuck Ordway?
He had his some of his men
hold me
while he took a whip to me.
And on top of that, he--
He stomped
on my gun hand.
I couldn't use it
for months later.
Well, for goodness' sakes, why?
I've told you
all you need to know.
I hear Sebo Pearlo carries
the same marks you do.
Well, he's after the same thing
you are: Ordway.
You might tie up
with him.
There's some things
a man won't share.
I have my way of doing things,
and it isn't Sebo's.
Heh. You must hate him
as much as you do Ordway.
Just about.
One's a low-down coyote
who always figured
a cowboy's coin
was his legitimate loot.
Ordway's a mountain lion
who clawed over everybody
using a six-shooter
and a whip for those
who wouldn't keep his law.
TUCK:
I know what Madden's back for.
He's like all the rest who have
dreams of making me eat dust.
There never was a day
when I couldn't run
any one of 'em down the road.
I'll wait for Madden
to show his hand.
Then I'll drive him out again,
and this time
he'll never come back.
Still,
he saved my life.
Yes, and he told you why.
He was just
being mouthy.
Uh, Rex, Jeff Barclay's here
to see you.
Why, that dirty excuse
for a deputy
oughtn't to be allowed
on Warbonnet.
I'll see what he wants.
Excuse me, Dad.
You can go back,
Tom.
What brings you here?
You have a ruckus with some
of the boys in town yesterday?
To be more exact about it,
they had a ruckus with me.
One of them's dead.
That's why I'm alive.
I've gotta take you along,
Willard.
Take him along?
There'll be a coroner's inquest
in town this afternoon at 3:00.
What happens after that
depends upon
what the jury decides.
It's a frame-up.
They're sure to make
a murder charge out of it.
Give us a couple of minutes.
Make it fast.
I ain't got all day, huh?
The inquest
can only be a formality.
It was out-and-out
self-defense.
They'll have the jury
rigged against you.
Once you're in
in Little River,
they'll never let you leave.
That's right, Rex.
He's Pearlo's man.
Body and soul and badge.
Good or bad, he's the only law
in Little River.
If I defy him,
I outlaw Warbonnet
and line up
all the townspeople against us.
And that's just what Pearlo
expects me to do.
Well, I'll disappoint him.
Whoa, boy.
Let's go.
I'll tell your father.
He'll send some hands into town
and take him back.
No, Hap.
That isn't the way
he'd want it.
He's trying to play
an honest game
with a crooked deck.
I still may be able to help.
Saddle my horse.
I was hoping you'd be out
this morning.
Beautiful day
for a ride.
It's good to get away
from the smell of whiskey.
I won't be able to ride
with you today, Reva.
Something wrong?
I'd like you
to do me a favor.
Sure. Glad to do
anything I can.
It's Reva.
This isn't the healthiest way
to come visiting.
I didn't want anybody
to see me.
I brought you a message
from Corinna.
You surprised that she speaks
to a person like me?
I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.
Corinna and I meet often
during our rides.
Perhaps the fact
we have nothing in common
has made for more
interesting friendship.
You shouldn't have any trouble
making friends.
At least with someone
like Corinna,
it's a welcome change.
She knew you wouldn't listen
to anyone from Warbonnet,
so she asked me to ask you.
Meet at your old circle M
about noon.
Whatever we had to say
to each other
was said a long time ago.
I've delivered the message.
I don't care whether you go
to see Corinna or not.
That's your business.
But I like her well enough
not to want to see her hurt,
and you can hurt her.
You seem to know a lot
about Corinna and me.
I know that your hate
has brought you back.
Everybody knows that.
A lot of people
are sticking their noses
into something
which doesn't concern them.
Hate won't bring you anything
but bitterness.
The best thing you can do
is ride out of Little River
and never come back.
Hello, Al.
Howdy, Reva.
Hey, Reva,
how 'bout a little drink?
Yeah, come on.
Maybe later, boys.
Phew!
You use more perfume
than I do.
I'm not in the mood today
for jokes concerning
my personal habits.
Something must be wrong.
You haven't touched your food.
I can't eat
when something's eating me.
Madden?
I'd like to kill him
and kill him slow,
the way the Yaquis do.
So it's Yaqui.
I always thought
you were part Indian,
but I never knew which kind.
I'm pure Castilian,
and don't you ever forget it.
Yes?
Jeff's got Willard
in jail.
In jail?
Yeah.
All right.
I thought Warbonnet
would throw Jeff off.
Well, it's not
what you expected,
but at least you got Willard
out of the way.
The settler
who brought the body in
said a stranger joined Willard
during the shooting.
My hunch is
it was Larry Madden.
Madden would never side
with Willard.
He probably didn't know
who Willard was.
If he should testify
for him...
Well, he knows Willard's
with Warbonnet now,
and he'd never side with him.
You're forgetting:
he's got whip marks.
I have them too,
but he wouldn't throw in
with me.
Tell the Peso Kid
I want to see him.
You play with a loaded gun,
and you're going to get
into trouble.
The Peso Kid
is a loaded gun.
I think you should remember,
Reva,
that the one thing
I don't want from you is advice.
Hello, Larry.
Hello, Corinna.
I've come here often.
That was the cruelest thing
of all,
touching a match
to your own ranch.
It saved your father
the trouble.
He never thought
it was good enough for you.
But I was willing to marry you
and live here.
You knew that.
I also knew
he expected your husband
to live at Warbonnet
and be pushed and ordered about
as he saw fit.
That's not fair.
It was only
your stiff-necked pride
that made you dream
of bringing me
to a place that compared
with Warbonnet.
Dad never understood.
He never tried to.
And on top of that, he heard
those ugly rumors about us.
He didn't have
to believe 'em.
What was he to believe
when day after day
I kept coming here
and there was never
any mention of marriage?
When I tried to explain,
he thought
I was just defending you.
Well, it worked out
all right for you.
You sold yourself
to a lot higher bidder.
Think what you want,
but it was three years
after you disappeared
before I went east
and met Rex.
I knew Dad wanted a son
to take over Warbonnet
when his day was done.
Well, I brought him one.
Is that such
a wicked thing to do?
I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't ask you here
to turn a knife into you.
Then, why did you
ask me here?
To find out what you're
going to do at the inquest.
Inquest?
Yes.
For the settler who was killed
when you helped Rex.
When is it?
This afternoon, 3:00.
Why should I do anything?
They're holding Rex.
If I know Sebo Pearlo,
his handpicked jury
will make a murder charge
out of it.
Rex is a good man, Larry.
A kind one.
He never liked it out here.
He only stayed
because I needed him.
I fished him
out of the fire once.
Do you expect me to go on
fishing him out?
I can't make you
do anything.
Oh, I know
why you came back.
If you want to start by taking
your vengeance out on Rex,
I can't stop you.
Make sure.
How do you feel?
Like I've been scalped.
No.
No, don't touch it.
What happened
to that kill-crazy kid
and his sidekick?
They took off when I cut loose
with my saddle gun.
How'd you know that sidewinder
was gunning for me?
Let's call it a hunch.
Where are you going?
The inquest.
Oh, it must be over
by now.
It was Sebo.
That cheap-smelling hunk
of cow grease
wanted me bushwhacked
so I wouldn't show up.
If I don't get back soon,
he's gonna start
asking questions.
You stay here
until your head clears.
I rounded up your horse
for you.
Thanks, Reva.
Maybe I can pay you back
sometime.
You can right now.
Ride out of here
and keep riding.
If you call Tuck Ordway
to account now, who wins?
If you don't,
you're dead.
And if I do?
Then the decent people
in town lose.
Ordway's influence
is the only thing
that holds Pearlo back.
You forget one thing:
a man's pride.
That's something
a woman can't answer.
If I had to pick a woman
who could understand,
I'd pick you.
What's a girl like you doing
tied in with a dog
like Pearlo?
Sometimes you can get
sort of attached to a dog.

Where can I find
that lead pusher
who calls himself
the Peso Kid?
Peso ain't been around here
yet today.
And Sebo?
He's, uh...
He's gone to bed.
So early?
Maybe he ain't
feeling well.
He'll feel a lot worse
when I get through with him.
Tell him that.
What happened at the inquest?
Murder. They're going
to take Willard
over to the county seat
for trial.
REVA:
¶ Oh, he looks like
He might buy wine ¶
¶ When he asked me... ¶
Oh, say, Madden,
there's something wrong
with my bronc's hoof.
I wonder if you'd mind
taking a look.
Sure.
Where have you been?
Peso Kid tried to bushwhack me.
You go to the inquest?
Yeah. It was a farce.
That coroner acted like
he was Pearlo's brother.
You got a knife?
Oh, yeah.
Anyone mention me?
No.
Not even Willard?
That doesn't make sense.
It does if you know Willard.
He's a gentleman
with a gentleman's code.
You saved his life.
He isn't gonna have
your neck stretched
to save his hide.
The darned fool.
When they move him over to
the county seat for the trial,
you're going to defend him.
Tell them I'm the one who shot
that settler, not Willard.
Whose side
are you on anyway?
My side.
I don't want him taking
any blame for me.
Okay. It's your funeral.
But if you just let me
get the marshal out here
and have Ordway thrown off,
you wouldn't be in this.
BARCLAY:
Evening, Ames.
Oh, hello, Jeff.
Just a pebble
stuck in his shoe.
Oh, thanks.
Say, how 'bout a drink?
I worked up a thirst
just watching you.
Some other time.
REVA:
¶ I can feel their eyes ¶
¶ I can hear
Their murmured sighs ¶
¶ Otherwise
They continued marching by ¶
¶ Otherwise
They continued marching by ¶
Sebo wants to see you.
Well...
Whenever I put this on,
I feel I've left all that
behind me.
Sort of makes me feel
like a gentleman.
Or do you think
it takes more than this
to make a gentleman
out of me?
If you like to wear
a smoking jacket
and drown yourself
in perfume,
that's your business.
Sometimes, Reva, I don't think
you approve of me.
You haven't heard me
complain.
No.
That's why I value you.
You know when to talk,
and you know when to listen.
The important thing
is never to confuse the two.
What brought that on?
Nothing in particular.
It's just that I worry
about the things I value.
And today...
Well, I was worried
about you.
Why?
You were gone much longer
than usual.
I told you.
I was going riding.
Did you enjoy it?
Takes me out of here
for a while.
I see.
Makes you feel like a lady
for a few hours.
You were gone so long,
I thought something
might have happened to you.
My horse broke loose
when I stopped to rest.
I was some time
rounding him up.
Nothing else?
Nothing.
There are three bullets
missing from your saddle gun.
I fired them at a snake.
He reminds many people
of a snake.
Who?
The Peso Kid.
You've often told me how much
he reminds you of a snake.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Don't try to help Madden.
Understand?
You're crazy!
Why would I?
Don't lie to me.
I'm not!
I swear I'm not!
Since I can't prove otherwise,
I'll pretend I believe you.
Just remember one thing:
you're Sebo's girl.
Don't ever cross him.
CORINNA:
Rex!
I was afraid of this.
The inquest
was a mockery.
We can grab him away
right now.
Then they would have
a legitimate charge against me.
Let 'em. And let 'em
try and take you.
I don't want it this way.
This is a chance to prove
that Warbonnet is on the side
of law and order.
Oh, whose law and order?
His?
Right or wrong,
he's the only law around here.
This is the best way
that I know of to prove
that everything that Pearlo's
been saying about us is a lie.
We better get going.
I'll come to Sentinel
with a lawyer.
BARCLAY:
All right, Sam.
I'm counting on you,
Peso.
I don't want Willard
turned loose
by no slick-talking
Sentinel lawyer.
Corinna!
I should've known I couldn't
count on you to help.
I couldn't get
to the inquest on time--
You don't have to explain.
Couldn't or wouldn't?
Look, there's a lawyer in town.
His name is Luddington.
Let him handle the trial
in Sentinel.
What kind of a fool
do you take me for,
to hire any lawyer
you'd recommend?
I only thought to help.
Yeah.
They'll hang him.
Okay,
have it your own way.
Hire his lawyer.
He's got more nerve
than you can hang on a fence.
Hyah!
Who is it?
The Peso Kid.
Give me a gun.
Just sit still.
Hyah!
BARCLAY:
It's Madden!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Sebo in?
Yeah.
SEBO:
Well?
He's dead.
Where's Peso?
Being chased by Madden.
Madden?
He came up just as the Peso Kid
shot Willard.
He saw it?
REVA:
Well...
there goes your plan
to blame it on the settlers.
I tell ya, Sebo,
we're in trouble.
When they get wind
of this in Sentinel--
Sentinel?
What do you think's gonna happen
when Ordway finds out
you had his son-in-law
shot down?
Shut up, Reva.
Everybody knows Larry came
back here to gun for Warbonnet.
Well, he picked off
Willard first.
I think maybe
he did us a favor.
A big favor.
Larry, you better keep moving.
Warbonnet's in town.
They know you got Willard.
I got Willard?
Yeah.
Why, it was that crazy,
little gun-skinner.
You mean the Peso Kid?
I wasted a lot of time chasing
him over half the country.
Barclay's story is
that a masked rider
held up the stagecoach
and shot Willard and the driver.
He says the killer
sounded like you
and was just about your size.
Then why doesn't that lying
law dog arrest me?
Well, because he says
it's your word against his,
and he's just not too sure.
He's just sure enough
to target me to Warbonnet
instead of the Peso Kid.
If you're here in the morning,
I won't stop him.
You're going to tell the truth
about that killing.
Who killed Willard?
No. No more. No more.
Who killed Willard?
It was the Peso Kid.
Louder,
so they all can hear you.
It was the Peso Kid
that killed Willard!
Get up.
You're going with me.
Hey, Tom.
It's that
two-bit deputy again.
Looks like he got caught
in a stampede.
I guess they didn't see
his badge.
I wanna talk to Corinna.
Who are you?
Larry Madden.
Drop 'em.
Open up.
You may go in,
but you won't get out.
I'll take that chance.
Now, mount up.
Come on,
let's go.
You ought to know better
than to show your face
around here.
Tell 'em.
Go on, tell her
what you told me.
It was the Peso Kid
that killed your husband.
I just wanted you to know,
no matter what
you think of me,
I'm not a murderer.
Wait...
I'm sorry for what I said
this afternoon.
I thought--
Don't get me wrong.
I might have killed Willard
had he stood between me
and Tuck Ordway,
but at least I'd have given him
a chance to defend himself.
Get him out!
Just a minute.
I told Tuck you were here.
He wants to talk to ya.
I didn't come through that gate
just to make talk.
Maybe you figure
you won't stand so tall
in front of Tuck Ordway.
Let's see how tall stands.
Take him out.
Your father don't want you
in there.
Why did you come back?
Well, speak up.
I came back to kill you.
All right.
I'll give you your chance...
now.
Tuck, Corinna's outside.
We'll get this over with
someplace else.
In your day,
you were faster with a gun
than I ever wanted to be.
I'm not so sure it would be
a fair fight now.
I can give you cards and spades
any day of the week.
I always could.
Are you trying
to crawl out of it?
Try me.
Will the Wayside house
suit you?
As good as any place.
I'll be there
at sunup tomorrow.
Now, get out.
So it's all talk, huh?
He's around in back.
He goes in the back door.
You go in the front.
When you find each other,
you start shooting.
What kind of a darn
fool play is this?
It's darker in there
than inside of a boot.
Tuck's giving you a break.
A break?
It'll be an even fight
in there.
You know no man ever beat him
to the draw.
All right, if that's the way
he wants it.
Nobody draws till they're inside
and the door's closed.
He's coming in now, Tuck!
He'll be all right.
Better get the wagon up here.
It'll take more than a bullet
in the shoulder to kill Tuck.
He didn't see the gun
even after you opened that door.
How long has he been blind?
Uh, two, three years.
He still got some sight left,
but not much.
You shoulda told me.
We've kept it from everyone.
Pearlo woulda killed him
if he'd heard about it.
You could've kept him
from comin' here.
Tuck still got his pride.
That's why he wanted it
this way, here in the dark,
where it'd be a fair fight:
you blind and him blind.
It wasn't even that. I saw
his gun flash when he fired.
Larry...
I think there's something
you oughta understand.
Might make you realize
you've been on the wrong side.
Say it.
Except for Warbonnet,
there's only one thing
ever meant a darn to Tuck,
and that was Corinna.
He knew she was eating
her heart out for you,
and you wouldn't even
show your face.
I'd have come to Warbonnet
when I stood big enough,
so he couldn't make me
knuckle down to him.
How was Tuck to know that?
All he knew was she was always
sneaking off to see you,
and then he heard that talk
about you two.
He almost went
out of his mind.
He had no cause
to make me eat dust.
If I'm on the wrong side,
Tuck Ordway put me there.
All right, so he was wrong,
dead wrong.
But you just collected for it.
Now the score is even.
Ride out and leave him alone.
I hope you're proud
of yourself,
shooting a half-blind,
old man.
Well, welcome to Little River,
Mr. Feathergill.
Nice meeting you again,
Mr. Luddington.
Well, is Mr. Madden here?
No, he'll be around later.
Boys, this is Jim Feathergill.
He's a federal marshal.
He came all the way
from Washington.
And these men here
are government surveyors.
MAN: Surveyors?
What's goin' on?
What's a federal marshal
doing here?
Let me have
that proclamation, Frank.
This'll explain it
to you, boys.
"Whereas Tucker Ordway
of the township of Little River
"in Sentinel County has not
made the requisite filings
"on the land occupied by him,
"all such lands are hereby
restored to public domain
"and ought to be open
to settlement and entry
"on the 17th day
of July, 1892.
"Signed,
President Benjamin Harrison
and secretary of state
James G. Blaine."
Land rush!
Yahoo!
Ordway's been kicked off!
Warbonnet's being opened
for settlement.
Nail this up,
will you, Frank?
And post some others
around town.
AMES:
Oh, Sebo...
Sebo, I'd like you
to meet Mr. Feathergill.
This is Sebo Pearlo.
BOTH :
How do you do?
Mr. Pearlo operates
the palace here.
Mr. Feathergill
is a federal marshal
who's gonna handle
this land rush.
Who found this out?
Why, Luddington did here
at the request of a Mr. Madden.
Madden, huh?
You been tied up
with him?
Ah. I'm his lawyer, Sebo.
He paid me to find out
all I could about Warbonnet.
You're a fool, Ames.
Whatever he paid you
I'd have doubled
to know this.
What happens to Tuck Ordway?
Why, we're on our way now
to put him off
and have his land surveyed
for quarter sections.
Some soldiers are coming in
to see that he leaves peaceably,
and they'll also guard
against any sooners
trying to jump the gun.
Now, where's your livery stable?
Up the street.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Come along, boys.
We're gonna have
a land rush!
Hey, did you hear?
Warbonnet's public domain!
I told you to hold off
on the marshal
until I had my showdown.
Why wait? Look, Larry,
homestead that quarter section
where the ranch buildings
are standing,
and you've got the sweetest
little ranch around.
You and me
could handle it easily.
I wanted Tuck Ordway's hide,
not his home.
Had I known then
what I know now,
I'd have never come back.
What do you mean
"know now"?
Ordway's half-blind.
He can't see beyond
the end of his hand.
I just came
near killing him.
Well, isn't that what
you came back here for?
Not to shoot it out
with an old man half-blind.
You can still hurt him my way
and do yourself some good
in the bargain.
Get this straight, Ames, I want
no part of Warbonnet land.
As far as I'm concerned,
the whole game's over.
I have one more piece
of business to take care of,
then I'm riding out
for good.
You know, you've been making
an idiot out of yourself
because of Ordway's daughter--
I thought you had more sense
than to ride back into town
with Madden still around.
I miss very much
the eating,
the drinking,
and...the girls.
Don't look at me
like that.
How can I forget
that you're Sebo's girl.
Ah, but if you were not--
I'd sooner hold hands
with a rattlesnake.
Or perhaps
with Señor Madden?
Anyway, watch yourself.
He's gunning for you.
You know,
he should be careful.
Someday he's liable
to catch me.
AMES:
Pearlo?
Hm?
I wanna talk to you.
Come in.
I came over to tell you--
What do you want?
Some drunken cowpoke reached
for me instead of a bottle.
It'll only take me
a minute to mend it.
Are you sure of this?
Madden just told me--
She belongs to Sebo.
I have no secrets from her.
Madden just told me
all about it.
He said Ordway
can't see any farther
than the end of his hand.
That's why he hasn't shown
his face in town
all this time.
Hm. We both would
have been better off
if you'd have tied up
with me instead of Madden.
That's why I'm here, Pearlo.
We can cash in
on this land rush
if we play it smart.
Sit down.
PESO KID:
Andy.
Come here.
Give it to me.
What?
Maybe this will help you
to remember, huh?
Who is this for?
Larry Madden.
Don't come back
for a while.
What's so important,
Sebo?
Tell me, my dear,
have you ever met Madden
outside of here?
Of course not.
What's all this about,
anyway?
Sometimes
I can't help but feel
that in him
you see all the things I'm not.
I never gave you
any cause to think that.
No, you were too smart
for that.
But not smart enough
to realize
that he'd have nothing to do
with your sort.
But me?
Well, I always
liked leftovers.
If you called me in here
just to insult me--
I can insult you
anywhere.
You usually do.
That's what I like
about you, Reva.
You always have
an answer.
Now, let me hear
what your answer is to this.
Why were you going
to meet him?
Did you just
wanna be alone with him?
Or were you going
to tell him
what Ames and me
were talking about?
I heard nothing.
I--
I've warned you
what would happen
if you ever tried
to cross me.
No, Sebo, you're wrong
about that note.
Oh, let me out
of here.
We'll go out
the back way,
then we'll ride out
of town.
For a while,
it will be pleasant.
No!
Try that again,
I'll kill you right here.
Don't move.
Mr. Madden?
Mm-hm.
Good.
She's anxious
to see you.
How is she?
And don't,
uh, be too long.
Hello,
Reva.
I'm glad you came,
Larry.
There's something
I have to tell you.
Who did it?
It doesn't matter.
You'd only trade
one hate for another.
I've had enough
of that.
I had my showdown
this morning.
I know.
I tried to tell you
you couldn't win.
Who shot you?
Was it Pearlo?
The Peso Kid?
Forget him.
Then he's back.
Forget him, Larry.
What I have
to tell you is,
Pearlo knows
Tuck Ordway can't see.
Who told him?
Luddington.
They made a deal
to swamp
the land rush.
So he tied in
with Pearlo.
Larry?
I've only had one real friend
in this town.
Corinna.
She's been
hurt enough.
If her father
ever rides in now,
he'll never
ride out again.
She still loves you,
Larry.
She always did.
I could tell
the way she looked
when she mentioned
your name.
Like somebody
that was...
trying to put out
a fire.
Whatever chance there was
is gone now.
I should never
have come back.
You'd better leave now,
Mr. Madden.
You better go.
Larry.
It's not too late.
I'd be better off
if he'd got me
at the Wayside house.
Or you him.
He didn't even
give us a chance
to file
our own buildings.
Well, he wanted
to get even,
and he has.
After 30 years
on the Warbonnet,
I have to ask
for a roof over my head.
Mrs. Henderson won't mind
putting us up.
Ain't that
Tuck Ordway?
Yeah, this is the first time
he's come to town
in two, three years.
Ah, he don't look
so tough to me.
Peso,
did you know Tuck Ordway
is almost blind?
I wonder just how fast
the old señor is with a gun.
Just slow down on him.
You'll find out.
That's just
what I'm going to do.
I'll see if she's home.
Yeah.
PESO KID:
Señor Ordway.
I've always wanted
to meet you, señor.
Who are you?
He's
the Peso Kid,
Pearlo's
sidewinder.
That's a word
I don't like.
What do you want?
I've heard so much
about how quick you are
with a gun.
I've heard it said
there is none quicker.
There ain't.
Now, if you know
what's good for you--
Keep out of this, Hap.
The señor
took the words
out of my mouth.
There will be time
for you later.
Can't you see
what he's doin', Tuck?
He's tryin' to make you
go for your gun.
I was only trying
to see
if the señor is as fast
as I have heard.
Of course,
should he want to drag it
because he's an old man,
then let him say so,
and I will understand.
You little punk.
LARRY:
I've been lookin'
for you, Peso.
Turn around.
Turn around
unless you wanna drag it.
He was tryin' to make
your father go for his gun
when Madden
came up.
I didn't need
your help.
I didn't do it
for you.
He had it coming.
I never would have left here
till I got him.
We'd better
go in, Dad.
There's something
I think you oughta know.
Better have somebody watching
your backs during the land rush.
Ames Luddington and Pearlo
have teamed up
to swamp the race
to get your quarter section.
Are you trying
to frighten us
out of racing
for our own home?
I'm only trying
to advise you.
Advise us?
You?
If it hadn't been for you,
there'd be no land rush.
That lawyer double-crossed me.
Did it without my say-so.
Well, you've done
what you came back to do,
so there's no need
to lie about it.
I suppose you'll be racing
for our land too.
I might.
Oh, I see.
You won't be satisfied
till you're sitting
in Tuck Ordway's chair.
Hyah!
Forget
about Madden.
He's too far
behind.
Each of you ride
for a different stake.
Whoa.
You couldn't have been
that far out ahead
of the rest of us.
I gave myself
a few hours' head start.
They weren't keeping as close
a watch on the north side
because of the hills.
You might have got shot
as a sooner.
I took that risk.
It didn't do you
any good.
I just staked out
this quarter section.
Well, we'll just change that
when Sebo gets here.
CORINNA:
Larry, look out!
HAP:
Quick!
Ho!
Thanks
for the warning.
How'd Luddington
get here?
He was a sooner.
Nothing would've stopped him
from getting this section.
I saw your stake
when we drove up.
Thirty years
I've lived here.
I don't need eyes to know
every inch of ground,
every stone in the wall,
every blade
of grass.
Well, we may as well
get off
before the new owner
kicks us off.
I didn't ride
to win this for myself.
It's yours.
I told you I wanted no part
of your land.
I'm turning it over
to you,
and then I'm riding out
for good.
TUCK:
Larry.
Come closer
so I can see you.
All this
wouldn't have happened
if I hadn't been
so pigheaded
and driven you off.
Maybe it isn't too late
to make up for it.
I'm asking you
to stay.
Come on, Hap.
Is it too late,
Corinna?
Does it matter?
It always has,
and it always will.
Oh, Larry, five years
is such a long time.
We can put
all those years behind us
by walking through
that door.
We'd better go in.
Let me take care of that.
