- Turn your toes in.
- All right.
Nod your head.
It looks like
Old Sunshine is still champ.
So far, no one has ridden him
for the eight second count.
Getting a Brahma bull
to leave isn't easy.
Get off the wall.
The first bull rider
is Pascadera's only cowboy...
and the former champion
in this event...
J.R. Bonner.
And he drew for himself
the current champion
Brahma bull...
Buck Roan's Old Sunshine.
And he ain't never been rode.
Hang around, old J.R.
His name's Red Terwiliger,
although a lot of cowboys...
are calling him money bags
these days.
Red Terwiliger and his
Brahma bull called Tornado.
Best score on that ride...
on a maximum score of 100.
That puts Red out in front.
...Rodeo Cowboy Association
and officials...
thank you very much
for coming out.
We hope you've enjoyed it.
Please drive safely,
walk carefully.
Maybe I ought to take up
another line of work.
See you in Prescott, J.R.
Fill it up, sir?
Let me have four gallon.
Make it regular.
Hello.
Howdy.
- Howdy, mister.
- Hi.
Well, she's about
two quarts low.
You want to let me
have that forty weight?
Forty weight? You bet.
- I'll take some of them apples.
- We have some nice, fresh ones.
All right.
That'll be thirty cents.
Thank you.
You bet.
It's 8:45
in the Mile High City.
Robert B. Goode here.
You're in tune to KMOT radio.
The temperature
stands at 78 degrees
outside of the studios.
Locally,
up to 40,000 visitors...
- Hi, J.R.
- Hey, how's the bull rider?
Lonesome.
Hey, give him a beer.
Not for long.
Wait till you try
our brand of sunshine.
Come on, boys.
Come and get it.
A little more, Pete,
a little more.
Ace!
Oh, Ace!
Sorry I missed you, Ace.
Have you seen Ace Bonner?
Who?
Ace Bonner!
Never heard of him!
It only costs $5,000, Curly.
I don't need a penny more,
and I wouldn't take it...
if you dropped it
playing solitaire.
I can hit it, boy.
Ace, you never missed...
not when it came
to costing me money.
All right, so I never found much
of that Nevada silver.
But, Curly, this time,
I'm talking about Australia...
gold.
Dad, Australia's a long reach.
It's too long for me.
But, boy, I've already invested
my last 3,000 in this project.
I don't want any part of it...
not a penny of it.
I'm fed up to here
with your schemes.
If you want to stick around
here, that's fine with me.
I'll put you on a weekly
allowance, but that'll be that.
Send his bill to me, Rose.
Well, anyway, honey,
I'm in your hands.
The nurse's best equipment...
her hands and her heart.
My hand on your heart, Rose.
...but first
a word from our sponsor.
Hi, folks, I'm Curly Bonner.
Have I got some news for you.
Neighbors, if you're thinking
about a second home...
or retirement
in the clean air country...
then look no further than my new
mobile home development...
Iocated just east
of Prescott, Arizona...
the Mile High mountain area...
with friendly people waiting
to meet and greet you.
Now, come out and visit me
at the Bonner Trading Post.
- Howdy, men.
- Howdy, Buck.
Hi, Buck.
Hey, you boys mind getting
down off the fence there?
Thank you.
Hey, Claude, put this old
black hookin' son of a bitch...
in by himself somewhere.
- I'll get him.
- I'll get him.
Hey, watch him there.
He'll stick his tongue in you.
Get in there.
Come on, cattle!
Now, now!
Get in there!
Get in there!
What's that black little
orange number?
Just a second. Eleven.
Check.
Thanks.
This is a rough way
to miss a paycheck, J.R.
You'd have to be an idiot
to ride one of them bulls.
Hey, Junior, you got
to watch that old bull.
He's meaner than a snake.
Most fellas would like to
trade him off for a hound pup...
and then pay $10
to get the hound pup shot.
Well, good morning, J.R.
J.R., how are you?
- How's everything, Bill?
- Real good.
- Sure glad to see you.
- Nice to see you. Hello.
- When did you get in?
- Last night.
We got your entry. Got you down
for the bronc riding...
the bull dogging,
the bull riding...
and the wild cow milking.
You can put my dad's name down
for the wild cow milking...
and I'll do the mugging.
That sounds great. Good to see
you and your dad together again.
Thank you.
- What did that come to, Frances?
- 125.
OK, 25,
plus 6, 7, 8, 9...
and 30. And 20 makes 50.
We sure thank you.
Punch all those bulls
in the morning about 10:00.
- I'll be there.
- Real good.
You haven't seen my dad
around, have you?
No, I sure haven't.
I saw Curly yesterday, though.
I bet he'd know where he is.
Much obliged.
- We sure thank you.
- Thank you.
- See you later, now.
- All right.
Yeah, war paint.
Good morning, Red.
J.R.
You got Pontiac
and Chino Valley.
Yep.
Yeah. I didn't see you
around the palace.
I slept outside.
Lend me $15, Red.
You already owe me 25.
Well, that's 40.
You got change?
Well, now, I'll get it.
Hey, come around tonight,
and I'll win that back from you.
Hey, yeah, why don't you
stick around, J.R.?
Are you coming?
I tell you what we could do...
if y'all get your car
and everything...
All right.
See ya.
Big hearted, ain't he?
Yeah, Red.
Heart almost as big as yours.
Hey, York,
Buck Roan still around?
No, he went down to the palace.
Hey, J.R. Hello.
- Ben.
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.
- Welcome home, J.R.
Good to be home, Del.
Thanks.
First drink's on the house.
Well, that's a change,
isn't it?
Two beers.
Dos cervezas. Yes, ma'am.
Sure been a spell, J.R.
Por mi amigo. Tome mucho.
You betcha.
Hey, you girls.
Will you go home
and get your IDs?
Just go home and get legal,
will you, please?
You always say that, Del.
Yeah, the sweetest things.
See you later.
J.R.
Hello, Homer, Red.
Hi, J.R.
- You want a beer?
- Don't mind if I do.
Why not? I can't dance.
Hey, Buck,
I'll be right there.
I'm not going anywhere.
You ready for another?
Just leave her on the bar.
Del.
Don't you know it?
Fine.
Have a seat. Sit down.
How you feeling?
Not bad. Not bad.
You act like you're hurting.
I'm just fine.
You contracting
the Salinas show, are you...
after you close out here?
Hell, I got to go on
to Cheyenne...
and rest my stock
a little bit.
You looking forward to riding
for your hometown folks?
Yeah. Me and my dad
are gonna be working...
the cow milking together.
Well, that's a pair to draw to.
Well, that's me and Ace,
all right.
Money?
Well, money's
nobody's favor, Buck...
but I want to ride that
Sunshine bull of yours again.
The way your luck's running...
you're just liable
to draw him again.
I just don't want to be
counting on my luck.
You know I don't
set the draw, Junior.
Now, listen, most cowboys would
pay you to stay off that bull.
I don't suppose you're
thinking about paying me...
to draw him for you, are you?
Well, it's just like I said...
money's nobody's favor.
I'll be damned
if you're not serious.
Just one of him and one of me.
Look, Junior,
neither me or my bull...
aim to make a living
off another fella's pride.
Now, you might as well face it.
You're just not the rider
you was a few years back.
I need it, Buck.
It's my hometown.
Talk to him on your time, J.R.
He's on my time now.
Right, Buck?
That's right.
You heard what the man said.
I got to go to work before
somebody else gets his money.
Maybe you'll get lucky
in Salinas, J.R.
Yeah.
- Hey, Red.
- Yeah.
Come on.
I'll ride that bull
for half the prize money.
You sure are
a man of confidence.
And mighty generous, too.
That's me, Buck...
just full of confidence.
I'll give you that.
Come on, Buck.
We're all set up.
Deal the cards, boys.
Now, easy, boy.
I'm one of the good guys.
Go ahead.
He's your pa's dog, all right.
He'll either shake your hand
or bite it off.
Well, let's see.
You're lookin'
just fine, sugar.
Come on, now.
Here, let me have
those tomatoes.
Yeah.
You farming now, are you?
Sure as hell am tryin'.
What's the old man's dog
doin' here?
Waitin' on him to get out
of that hospital, that's what.
Well, what's he doing there?
He ran off the Cherry Creek Road
last night.
Was he drinking?
What do you think?
Totalled his truck.
Is he OK?
He's fine.
The thing is, the devil
sure takes care of his own.
I went up to the ranch
looking for Ace...
and somebody's turned that place
into a gravel pit.
- Did you know that?
- Yeah. Curly.
Ace sold out to him.
He got this notion to prospect
for silver up in Tonopah.
And then he left
with 15,000 in his jeans.
That's all Curly paid him
for that land, is $15,000?
That's all.
Four sections up there.
I know.
Curly and Ruth still
run that place up the highway?
They're the two busiest people
in this county.
Curly started
a mobile home development...
on the ranch right in back
of the trading post.
And he isn't stopping there.
Junior...
where are you going to stop?
Well, about that money
I haven't been paying you...
Iooks like there's
gonna continue to be...
an interruption there.
Is that what it's called?
A continued interruption?
Well, don't worry about it.
It doesn't matter.
Your brother
is taking care of things.
He's selling this place, is he?
Why not?
Mobile homes
are the thing of the future.
Yeah.
Curly coming to supper tonight?
Yeah.
I think he wants to see you.
OK.
You and Ace.
Maybe you're the lucky ones,
drifting the way you do.
Maybe.
How long you been
keeping boarders, Mom?
A year.
- Where you going?
- I'm going up to the hospital.
Figures.
See you tonight.
Is he hurt bad?
I can keep him
off the ceiling...
but I can't keep
his hands off me.
Come back in the morning.
He was asking for you.
When he wakes up, you tell him
I'm around, would you?
Folks, if you gather around...
I'd like to tell you a few words
about the Reata Rancheros.
Now, the Bonner Trading Post
was established in 1955.
It was ten years before
the last clean air in America...
was reportedly seen
in Flagstaff, Arizona.
I'm no fancy scientist. I'm just
a United States businessman...
and I'm proud of it.
But I'll guarantee you...
Prescott's air
is as clean or cleaner...
than our illustrious neighbor
to the north.
We have an air-conditioned
chartered bus over here...
to take you for a free tour
of the Reata Rancheros.
And we have these lovely
young ladies in hot pants...
passing out free maps
and brochures.
You'll find at
the Reata Rancheros...
Come to the bus.
It's about ready to load.
Pick up a brochure
on your way out.
Would you like a cookie
before you leave?
...and total, but I mean total,
electric living.
Now, I hope you enjoy
the free lemonade...
and cookies courtesy of
Curly Bonner's Trading Post.
Bonnie, Toby.
Excuse me, folks.
Step right this way,
ladies and gentlemen...
for a home on the range
retirement...
just ten minutes
from city shopping.
Hey, Junior.
How you doin', boy?
Good to see you.
Yeah? Hey, yeah.
How's that rodeo life
been treating you?
I got no complaints.
Curly, what are you doin'?
Hey, boy, I'm just making money
hand over fist.
You wait until you see
what I got lined up for you.
Hey, girls,
let's roll 'em, huh?
You just gonna love
what's happening here.
I'll see you at Mom's tonight.
Let's go, ladies and gentlemen.
Come on!
Step aboard, folks.
Come on, now.
Everyone, let's go.
The bus is loadin'.
Here you go.
Let me help you there, ma'am.
Come on down the highway
In the twilight of your life
Come and see Reata Rancheros
Come and bring your wife
Bring the little children, too
Because when
they've all grown up...
Then with the house gone,
then there's no problem.
Here, things are gonna be better
all the way around.
Mama's going to be living
inside of model home trailers.
Well, Mom can show
the people...
how roomy and comfortable their
lives can be on our Rancheros.
And she can be in charge
of our gift shop.
That would really
give her a chance...
to get rid of
some of these antiques.
Mom, do you have to smoke
while you're feeding our baby?
Almost forgot, boys.
Here's a couple of free ones...
best seats in the house.
Gee, thanks, Uncle Junior.
Now, you pass your Uncle Junior
those mashed potatoes and gravy.
You get some good draws
for tomorrow, Uncle Junior?
You better believe.
You could ride anything
with hair on it, Uncle Junior.
Well, you pays your money,
you takes your chances.
Pass the whiskey.
There never was a horse
that couldn't be rode...
there never was a cowboy
that couldn't be throwed.
Famous old saying, all right.
Well, Curly says that
you've seen one rodeo...
you've seen 'em all.
Well, I didn't mean
our rodeo, darling.
That's a part of history.
Well, still, it's just a rodeo.
So, you went to see him?
Yeah.
How much was it that you paid
for the old man's land?
which he proceeded to gamble...
and throw away in Nevada.
But he had to quit
prospecting...
twenty feet away from
mother lode, just like always.
It don't seem much.
Well, now he's got this scheme
to go to Australia.
Well, why don't you send him?
Come on, Junior. I put him
on a weekly allowance...
and that's that,
and I told him so.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Why don't you start thinkin'...
about your own self
for a change?
You may not know it...
but you are in the right place
at the right time. It's here.
It's a regular
land boom, Junior.
Yeah, I saw
your wide open spaces.
You know less about
wide open spaces than I do.
I know it here...
where it is.
You're just some kind
of motel cowboy.
a little bit short.
he still would've blown it all.
Now, he needed the money fast,
and I got it for him. Me.
I just want you to get a grip
on your future.
I want you to come work for me.
You want me to help you
sell the old man's land?
Our land.
Junior...
What a salesman you'd make
for the Rancheros.
Big cowboy like you...
sincere...
and you're genuine
as a sunrise.
Well, there's no point
in foolin' ourselves...
now, is there?
You got to ride.
Giddyap, giddyap. Got to ride.
That's right, Curly.
Salinas, California.
Day after tomorrow.
Will you think on what I said?
I just don't want you
turnin' out like the old man...
Curly! Curly,
what's happened?!
My God, you've killed him!
Damn, what a lickin'.
Junior...
Don't say it. I'm goin'.
And I'll send somebody over
tomorrow to fix that window.
And you take his
damn dog with you!
You just can't
walk out of here.
You just can't
walk out of here.
You see my feet on the floor,
don't you, Arlis?
Now watch my legs
make 'em move.
But you're not well enough!
I'm heaven-bound, sweetheart,
but not today.
Get that cleaned up,
will you, please?
Junior was in yesterday,
and he said he was coming back.
Well, he'll find me,
or I'll find him.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Ace, you get back in this room.
I'll use force if I have to.
You're not leaving
this hospital...
no matter what.
Orderly!
Orderly, stop this man!
Stop him!
I don't fight fair, boys!
And you are a fool,
Ace Bonner!
Adios, sweet angel of mercy.
Where to?
To the rodeo, partner.
Where the hell else?
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.
Well, do I get that draw,
or don't I?
I been thinkin' on it, Junior.
Kick in the head, Junior.
That's what it's about.
You know, Junior, if a man was
going to expand his business...
I'm talkin' more shows
and more towns...
he might be interested
in an assistant.
Say, a fella
that'd been around some.
A champion in his day.
Well, I just thought
I'd mention it.
Don't think so, Buck.
You had breakfast?
Nope.
How about we go down here and
get a little bread and gravy?
That'll be fine right there.
Keep the change, son.
Hey, dog. Where you been?
Stay here, boy.
Hey, you pretty
little girls...
you look like you might've
seen Junior Bonner.
No, but I'd be glad
to give him any message...
anytime.
Now, how'd I know
you was gonna say that?
Who do you suppose he is?
All those contestants planning
to ride in the parade...
please assemble
at the south parking lot.
Come on, come on.
Let's get on the float, OK?
Ace Bonner slept here.
He said he'd find you.
Here you go.
I'll make sure
he takes his medicine.
Hi, Ace.
Hey, Roy.
Are you still livin'?
Still around and kickin'.
How you been makin' it?
Better than I deserve.
Goin' down to get
in the big parade?
Don't you know it?
How many we rode in, Roy?
Not enough, Ace.
Not enough
and maybe too many, huh?
Too many, probably.
I wonder if I can hold him off
that first narrow.
I think I got company.
Hey, pretty little girls...
I want you to meet
Mr. Ace Bonner.
- How do you do, Mr. Bonner?
- Howdy.
No. That's me.
You J.R.'s dad?
I used to be. Didn't I, Roy?
That's right.
Come on, let me show you
the way into town.
Afraid we'll get lost?
No, I'm afraid
I'm gonna lose you.
- So long, Roy.
- So long, Ace.
No way, not me.
Hey. Johnny Muller.
Where's my horse?
Ace Bonner.
Ace?
You fellas just sit around
and let him take it?
Yeah.
Have we got all
our bull riders here?
Have we got all
our bull riders here?
'Cause I'm closin' the books.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
OK, well, here's what
we got today for you boys.

I got the time.

Sunshine.
That's Sunshine
twice in one week, J.R.
I'll buy you some more tape.
- All right, Red.
- Where you goin'?
I gotta go find my dad.
He stole my horse.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Prescott, Arizona...
and the 84th annual
Frontier Days celebration...
and the national
Fourth of July parade.
The grand marshal
in this Frontier Days parade...
Mr. Casey Tibbs.
How you doing, Casey?
Welcome to Prescott.
There's Ace Bonner.
Hi, Ace! Where you been?
Hey, Ace!
If you're still on your feet...
remember,
that first dance is mine!
I'll do 'er.
Howdy, folks.
Get your hot dogs,
your hard candy right here...
compliments of yours truly,
Curly Bonner...
from the Reata Rancheros!
Get your hot dogs, kids!
Get your hard candy!
That's what it's for!
Prescott's
junior high school band.
Seen the old man?
Yeah, he's up ahead between
the Indians and the flag.
I'm gonna
whip your ass, Junior.
Well, somebody is.
It ain't gonna be
the first time.
Hi, Bonnie.
Howdy, J.R.
- How you doin'?
- Fine.
Hello, Ruth.
J.R.
You always did love
a parade, Ellie.
You always did
sit a good horse, Ace.
Where'd you steal it?
We'd certainly like to thank...
the Air Force band
for being with us today.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Hello, cowboy.
I like your horse, Ace.
So do I.
Climb aboard.
Are you sober?
I'm as sober
as the day you met me.
I've been tryin'
to find you all day.
I was lookin' for you.
You stole my horse, Ace.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Yavapai County's own Ace Bonner!
And, riding with Ace Bonner,
his boy J.R. Bonner...
twice Frontier Days
champion bull rider!
Let's hear it!
I got a bottle, Ace.
You want a drink?
Watch them drunken idiots!
That's Junior's old man!
Watch out!
Don't run over 'em!
And here's Curly
of Reata Rancheros!
How you doin', Curly?
Ace!
Ace!
Hey, hold on!
What's the matter, son,
don't you like us?
All right, Ace, let me up
in the saddle, damn it.
Come on, you get up here
where you belong!
- No, you ride in the back.
- Mind your dad!
Yeah!
Easy!
Great.
Come on,
get up here, cowboy.
Get that damn horse
outta my yard!
I'm really sorry, ma'am.
For Christ's sake.
We're goin'.
You're gonna
get us killed, Ace.
Yeah.
- I gotta sit down.
- You and me.
Well, you fall off
better than I do.
Yeah.
That's the best ride
I've had...
since Christmas Eve
in Tonopah...
and I was snowed in.
Bobbie's?
Me and the buckeye.
She sends her regards.
Oh, yeah.
You ever hear
from Johnny Mars?
Yeah. He's bustin' horses
out of Carlsbad.
Still makes the El Paso show.
And Buddy Cox...
always hollered,
"As long as women live...
"my name will never die."
Well, he's dead, Dad.
Car crashed between
Abilene and Dallas.
Well, I hear
you're doin' very well.
Where'd you hear that?
Takin' care of Mom, are you?
Not much.
She's sellin' antiques
out the townhouse.
She's happy.
She's livin' right where she
wanted to live all her life...
right in the middle
of things.
Curly's gonna sell that house.
Put her in a curio shop.
Curly's doin' right well.
Junior...
I'm goin' to Australia.
What are you gonna do,
hunt kangaroos?
Gold for the findin',
that's what.
to prospect.
And sheep. Marino.
Finest wool in the world.
I already made
the down payment.
How would you like
to come down there with me?
Hell, I know you can't make it.
Not a big rodeo star.
But at least you could
grubstake your dad.
I'd make you
partner number one, Junior.
Partner number one.
What do you say to that?
There's somethin'
I gotta tell you.
No, somethin'
I gotta tell you...
about mining.
There's a lot to learn.
Rare metals... big future.
I'm busted, Ace.
Of course, you never
tried your hand at prosp...
Busted?
Flatter than a tire.
Well, all I need is 5,000.
Heh. How about five million?
Well, it's time to go to work.
If you're not too old to rope.
I'll do the muggin'.
Got us entered.
- Wild cow milkin'?
- You bet.
Come on.
Curly paid you the money
for the land, Pop.
What'd you do with it?
The honest intentions
of a man...
trying to make money
with money.
The unfortunate prey...
to the evils of nighttime ladies
and neon lights.
But, no, sir,
no matter what he says...
not penny one from Curly
will I take.
And I mean that.
Because...
Ace, one more parade.
Come ride in
the grand entry with us.
Can I steal your horse
again, Junior?
What's mine is yours.
Busted?
Opportunity of a lifetime.
Come on, girls.
All bronc riders report...
Acuff, Terwiliger,
Carson, and Bonner.
Damn it.
Well, if it isn't
Junior Bonner.
Hey, folks,
this is Junior Bonner.
Burt Hunsacker.
You remember me.
Six years ago,
a little place in Nogales.
Right after the Tuscon show?
Six years is a long time.
But you're sure
lookin' good, Burt.
Here's your grand entry...
for this, the 84th annual
Frontier Days Rodeo...
the oldest professional rodeo
in America.
It was on July 4th, 1888...
that cowboys
from the surrounding ranches...
first gave as an entertainment
to the people of Prescott...
an exhibition
of ranch activities...
and cowboy sports...
Hi, J.R.
The Prescott Frontier Days
celebration...
is the original cowboy rodeo
in America...
and in the years since,
it has continued to be...
one of the most honored and
well-known rodeos in America.
Hey, Bill, let me have
that rope, will ya?
I should mention here
that if any of you...
were at the big parade
downtown earlier this morning...
and are wondering if that fella
in the blue shirt...
on the Roan horse
is gonna compete today...
I can tell you he will.
Ace Bonner will be a contestant
in today's rodeo.
He's been a part of the rodeo
for 42 years.
Now here's the grand marshal
of this year's rodeo...
twice world champion,
all-around-cowboy Casey Tibbs.
Our rodeo stud contractor...
the man responsible
for all the bucking horses...
steers, and bulls
you're about to see...
Buck Roan.
Buck Roan of Amarillo, Texas.
And here's a pair of fellas...
who'll be entertaining you
this afternoon...
Tom Lucia...
and joining Tom...
the clown bull fighter
from Enid, Oklahoma...
Jim Hill.
All right, Tom. Hold it.
Better save that
for the Palace bar.
All right. There's $5,000
total prize money...
waiting on
these cowboys today...
so let's get
to the first event...
saddle bronc riding.
Number three, J.R. Bonner...
on a bronc named...
Hold it, J.R.
Don't start your ride
till the gate's open.
Get down on it easy, J.R.
Don't make no noise
on that gate.
Don't make no noise
on that gate.
Don't ask for it. Just...
Put him out, J.R.!
That a boy!
Rake him, rake him! That a boy!
A good ride
and a good try, J. R...
but a little short.
Let's have a hand
for J.R. Bonner.
You know somethin', Ace?
Old Junior's gonna
spoil all my horses...
if he don't quit
blindfoldin' 'em with his ass.
Can't win it that way, J.R.
No, you can't win 'em all,
partner.
Good ride. The score
for Bobby Fenly was 62.
Steer Wrestling.
Here's an event that
requires perfect timing...
on a straight run.
Bulldogger jumps
from his horse...
grabs the steer
by the horns...
stops him,
and puts him down.
That's that.
And as far as I know...
the steer is still runnin'.
$850 total first prize money.
J.R. Bonner...
Red Terwiliger
doing the hazing.
Steer number 42.
You're up, J.R.
- Ready, J.R.?
- Yep.
You're up.
All right. The boys are ready.
Good time for J.R.
A mighty fast time.
The best so far today...
Now the boys
will switch around...
with J.R. Doing the hazing
for Red Terwiliger.
You gonna beat
J.R.'s time, Red?
Steer 38!
Red Terwiliger!
He did it.
Time for Red Terwiliger...
Tough luck, cowboy.
It happens
all the time, dude.
I'll tell you what...
if you were to take
a cattle stampede...
and cross it
with a barroom brawl...
you just might come up
with something...
resembling our next event...
wild cow milking...
Now, don't you wait
for my loop to settle, Junior.
I'm accurate number one,
so the minute I throw...
you get your tail
in motion, boy.
And then I'll do my thing,
as they say.
Before we turn loose
those boys...
we got penned
in that circle over there...
They're the muggers,
and it's the muggers's job...
to hang on
and slow down the cow...
while the roper gets down
from his horse...
and handles
the milking chores.
You muggers and ropers remember
whose team it is, won't you?
All right,
turn the cows loose.
Here they come.
Rope 'em down.
Over here, Junior!
Here's your place.
Over here, Ace!
Come on, Ace!
That dog bit me again!
Get that dog outta here!
Not our cow, you knothead!
Damn it.
Get that yellow
son of a bitch outta here.
Come on, Ace!
Hang on to her, Junior.
I gotta fill it up again!
Gimme another shot at it.
- Come on, Ace!
- All right. One more second.
OK!
Hey! Hey, look out!
- Give me the bottle!
- No, no, no, I got it!
Come on, gimme that bottle!
Gimme the bottle!
I got it!
The winning team is
Rudy Martinez and Ray Poole.
Will somebody get
that damn dog?
We could've won.
We did, Ace.
How about a special hand now...
for the oldest contestant?
Ace Bonner...
Sixty years young
and still going strong.
And will somebody get that dog
the hell out of here?
That concludes the first half
of our performance.
We're going
to take a break now.
See you all back here at 3:30
for the concluding events...
in our Fourth of July
Frontier Days Rodeo.
So, what happened to her?
Just one of those things
you grin at and drink to.
Into the mouth
and over the gums...
Iook out, stomach,
here she comes.
Lord, but that does heal
the aches of a loser.
If this world's
all about winners...
what's for the losers?
Well, somebody's gotta
hold the horses, Ace.
You're right.
See you fellas later.
Now, you're gonna be there...
when I deal with that bull
of yours, ain't you, Buck?
Yeah, Junior, I'll be there.
Well, don't look at me, boy.
I don't make no decisions
with a drink in my hand.
Then you'd better
put that drink down...
'cause you've
got company, Ace.
He's in the navy now, Elvira.
Just home on leave.
That's fine, just fine.
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
I'm in trouble, son.
Take a deep seat, Ace.
If this is any of your idea...
I'll blister your tail
from here to next Wednesday.
You're not nervous,
are you, Ace?
Hi, Junior!
Hi, Grandpa!
How've you been?
Come on up here. You, too.
Golly, I missed you.
Did you kill any lions?
Did you find any silver?
Hello, Ace.
Mrs. Bonner.
Lookin' very well.
You don't look so bad yourself,
considerin'.
Dad, could we have a drink,
please? We're thirsty.
Yeah, please, Dad.
We're awful thirsty.
Why, sure you can.
We'll all have
ourselves a drink.
- Del?
- Yes, sir.
Beers all around
for these midgets.
Ace, Cokes.
- A round for me and my boys.
- Comin' up.
- Ruth?
- No. Beer is fine.
Ellie, I seem to recall...
you had an occasional taste
for bourbon whiskey.
Didn't think you'd remember.
Who could forget?
It was a nice float
you had, Curly.
Finished second
in the commercial division.
Well, second's
better than third.
Ellie.
Thanks.
This calls for a toast.
We are all together.
You're up, Ace.
Well, since I am
top of the pile...
to them as has
their roads ahead.
Ace?
Our dance.
Arlis.
Well, you all know Arlis here.
I've heard the name.
Hello, Mrs. Bonner.
Our dance, Ace.
Didn't you always save
the first dance for Mom, Ace?
It's a good idea, Ace.
Boys, times have changed.
I changed them.
Dance with her, Ace.
Sweet combination.
I can't dance
with both of you.
Come on, sweetheart,
let's cut it together.
Curly.
Come on, kids.
You want a beer, Curly?
Just like old times.
Now would you like a beer?
Junior, you're my brother...
and I guess I love you.
Well, we're family.
I don't care what you do.
You can sell one lot
or a hundred lots.
I'm just tryin'
to keep us together.
I gotta go down my own road.
What road?
I'm workin'
on my first million...
and you're still workin'
on eight seconds.
Curly?
Come on.
Come on, let's dance.
Here's a little song I wrote
for all the rodeo hands.
It's called "Rodeo Man."
I'll be in town
this weekend, honey
Look for me downtown
Anytime after
the band starts playin'
I'll be around
I'll park my two-horse trailer
Up at the rodeo grounds
Then I'll start roarin'
I'm the rodeo man
I picked up 35 bucks in Reno
Couldn't get a decent ride
But I'll do all right
in the Frontier Days
Unless all the good bulls die
I was raised
in the town of Prescott
I got my home folks
on my side
I'm gonna win top money
I'm a rodeo man
Gonna enter in the broncs
and the ropin'
On Saturday afternoon
And the bull ridin'
in the night show
While the band plays
a cowboy tune
And if I could just
draw me a mean one
Then stick on it
just like glue...
Champagne.
And three double bourbons.
I'm a rodeo man
When my last ride's over
And my ribs
are all taped down
I'll pick up
my top money buckle
And, honey,
we'll head for town...
Dance with me?
You do dance, don't you?
You're a little
out of line, Junior.
Not really.
I'll dance with him.
Yeah!
Hey, how about playin' somethin'
a little bit slower?
One dance, Junior.
I can't count much further.
Today I
Started lovin' you
Again
And I'm right back
Where I really
ought to be...
Hey, J.R.,
where'd you get the new doll?
What you doin', Casey?
That's a young filly
I picked up down in Cheyenne.
Just long enough
To let my heartache mend
Then today
I started loving you
Again
I got over you...
Hey, you mind if I cut in J.R.?
Well, I'll tell you
the truth, Red.
I kinda do.
Nothin' personal.
Well, I hope she treats you
better than Sunshine.
So do I, Red.
Who's the Sunshine
in your life?
Just the bull I'll be ridin'.
Thank you, J.R.
Hi, sweetheart.
Anybody ever tell you...
- You get.
- What?
Come on, I mean it.
Red's at it again!
Hold it! Hold it down!
You fight like
my old lady, Red!
We can't have no fightin'
around here.
Come on, Terwiliger!
Watch him, Buck!
- What's your name?
- Charmagne.
Why do they call you Junior?
Well, I tell you the truth,
I don't know.
- It got stuck, huh?
- Yeah.
Oh, no!
You from Phoenix?
Curly Bonner smacks
the gringos!
You work down here, do you?
In the bank.
It's not very exciting
compared to what you do, is it?
Well, not unless
you own the bank.
Misdeal.
My old lady's over there,
you know that?
Hey, sweet cheeks!
Come on,
let's get out of here!
Go on. Get the kids!
I watched you today.
You were pretty good.
I fall off a lot, don't I?
Keep clear, boys.
My dog don't fight fair.
Do you always run
with that crowd?
No. Anyway, it looks like
this crowd may not make it.
No, I don't think so.
Eat it! Eat!
You got a girl?
Why?
Why not?
I'm just passing through.
Where to?
I'm goin' up to Salinas,
El Paso, down to Fort Worth.
Just like old times.
Driving cowboy.
Stop it! Stop it!
Better hold up there!
I think it's time to play
something patriotic fellas.
Yeah, hold it, hold it.
Let's do
"The Star Spangled Banner".
Stop! No! OK? Stop!
Hey, Curtiss,
let's have a drink, huh?
The fightin' excitement's
all over with.
Here we go.
- Thank you.
- You betcha.
Think I'm feeling
a little better...
now I'm drinking this beer.
Yeah? What are you chasin'
all the girls for?
I love 'em.
No, no, Del,
it wasn't no bronc, but a bull.
Name of Holy Joe.
You remember him, Roy?
Yeah, I remember him.
Old Holy Joe...
blind in one eye...
meaner than a boot
full of barbed wire.
He sent a lot of good hands
to church.
Made more than one cowboy
do a little praying.
Well, sir, I wanted to draw
on that bull the whole year.
And don't you know...
when we got to
the Madison Square Garden...
by God, I got him.
I told Mr. Jack Dempsey...
in this restaurant
the night before...
we was introduced
as one champ to another...
I told him if he wanted
to see a real fight...
he ought to see me and that bull
go eight seconds.
Well, I rode that bull...
and after eight seconds...
there were
standing on their feet
and hollering my name.
That was the last time, though.
Ellie? Excuse me, boys.
Ellie, where you going?
Did you hear me, Ellie?
I asked you
where you were going.
To get some air.
Now, wait on me, honey.
I want to talk with you.
By hook or by crook,
I'm going to Australia.
Well, you always were good
at putting distance between us.
Now, look, honey...
don't turn your back on me.
I'm askin', what's a man to do?
Silver all shot to hell,
no more bounty on the lions.
Hey, you know, you could
go down there with me.
Ace, why don't you
just shut up?
She's sure got a case
of the knits, don't she?
Australia.
Silver in Nevada.
You are a broken record, Ace.
Now, quiet down, honey.
We don't want our wash
hung out in public.
Why the hell should I be quiet?
- Now, listen, honey...
- You listen...
'cause I just don't
give a damn anymore.
As far as I'm concerned...
you can go to hell
or Australia, but not with me.
Well, they're both
down under.
Dreams, sweet talk...
that's all you are.
If you stay with me...
I'll sweeten the dreams, too.
Remember?
Well, sure as hell,
I had that coming.
You sure as hell did.
But I'm leaving
for good, Ellie...
and I mean it this time.
Then all we got left is today.
Well, anyway, Ellie...
you seen one rodeo,
you seen 'em all.
Yeah. Sure.
The time for Billy Longer
and C.T. Jones...
Our next ropers...
a pair of Casa Grande,
Arizona cowboys...
Jim Carter and Paul Arnold,
looking to beat 16.4.
Bring the bulls on!
The winning time so far,
and Paul Arnold.
Get him in there!
Next up, Bob Malone
of Mayer, Arizona...
and Al Gardner
of Dewey, Arizona.
Let's go, J.R.
Our final pair
of ropers in team tying...
Henry Thompson
of Florence, Arizona...
B.W. White of Phoenix.
Well, you couldn't
make it much closer.
Better pull your hat
down today, pard.
We'll move along to the final
event on today's program...
bull riding, the most
dangerous event in rodeo.
In order to qualify
for prize money...
the cowboy must stay aboard
a twisting half-ton of fury...
for eight seconds.
You know, successful
or thrown in his ride...
the safety
of our bull riders today...
may well depend on the daring
of our rodeo clowns.
Scoring in this event
is similar...
to saddle and bareback
bronc riding.
Our 2 judges can score
up to 25 points...
on the performance
of the bull and the cowboy.
First place money, $950.
OK, the boys in the chutes
say they're ready to go.
Hold on, J.R.!
Well, that's
the luck of the draw, Bob.
Speaking of luck,
it's J.R. Bonner's luck...
to have drawn the country's
number one bucking bull...
undefeated in 29 rides...
the 29th of which was,
you guessed it, J.R. Bonner.
Four days later, right here
in his hometown of Prescott...
this former
bull riding champion...
is now back
to try Buck Roan's...
Old J.R. Bonner
on Old Sunshine.
Come on!
How about that ride, folks?
J.R. Has done it.
He's the first man ever
to ride Old Sunshine...
and a dandy ride it was.
Well, our rodeo judges
scored 92 points on that ride...
That's going to make him
about $950 richer.
Folks, that's
the last ride of the day.
- That was a hell of a ride, J.R.
- Well, it's about time.
This was some way to end...
the 84th annual
Frontier Days Rodeo.
I think you'll agree with me
that after 84 years...
they still make cowboys
as tough as they ever did.
We'd like to thank
the Prescott...
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.
Chaparral airlines flight 417
for Phoenix and Tucson...
is now boarding.
Passengers holding tickets may
board through gate number five.
Passengers holding space...
on the continuation
of flight 417...
please have your tickets
ready at the gate.
Rodeo time.
I got to get it
on down the road.
So long.
Ma?
Ma?
Junior.
You had to win, didn't you?
Yeah.
So long, Mom.
Hey, Junior! Junior!
Hey, Junior!
Don't you hear me, boy?
I'm sure you're going
to enjoy yourself. Thank you.
Good morning.
I'd like a one-way ticket
to Sydney, Australia...
a man and a dog.
All right.
Economy will cost you $585...
and first class is $798...
plus $40 for the animal.
- Write it first class.
- All right.
Put that in the name
of Mr. Ace Bonner.
And you can have it delivered
to him at the Palace bar.
All right.
Here's your money.
Who shall we say
paid for the ticket?
Tell 'em Junior sent you.
