Hey!
The sheriff ain't in.
Come back tomorrow.
You say something?
I only said the sheriff ain't in.
Well, where would we be
lucky enough to find him?
Fishing.
He'll be back tomorrow
for the hanging.
If I can help...
Why not.
You could tell us something.
Sure. What?
Some time ago, there was
a reward out for Bill San Antonio.
Five thousand, I believe.
I can check up.
It will only take a little while.
- I'll be...
- Take my word for it.
Here's all that's left of him.
Enough for the reward.
Our old friend died with his boots off.
No, I'm sorry. We need sure proof.
Unfortunately, I can't supply you
with "sure proof", as you call it.
He got blown up.
Come on, Hutch.
Let's not waste any more time.
Hey! What shall I do with these?
Play with them in your free time. Ha!
What can I do for you?
Take three or four men
and have them carry in the case
that's on that wagon.
And tell your friend to keep
his eyes peeled.
There's 300,000 in there.
Dollars?
As good as.
It's gold.
Same as got robbed from a train
on the MK&T a month ago,
and which we were lucky
enough to pick up.
- Really, sir, I...
- Just one more thing.
Where can we find the owner
of this piggy bank?
Mr. Harold's office is upstairs,
but the president isn't scheduled
to see anyone today,
Mr... I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name,
and unless I know that, I...
I never told you. Come on, Hutch.
Hey, you two.
If Mr. Pick says the president
won't see you,
it means you ain't going
anywhere, understand?
Get a move on.
Let's get that case out there
unloaded now, buttercup.
There's no use in running risks.
My good man, I think you better
announce us... to your boss.
But weren't you told that Mr. Harold
receives callers only by appointment?
He'll receive us. You'll see.
Just say it's San Antonio
who wants to talk to him.
You could be our Lord in person,
it would be the same thing.
Don't forget, huh?
Tell him, "Bill San Antonio".
If he sees us, it means
he and Bill were in cahoots.
Because a bandit that steals
a bank's gold from the train
is likely to be the last person
in the world
to know the president of that bank.
So if Bill was telling the truth,
and he kept swearing he was,
then half the gold he robbed
in the past few years
finished in the pockets
of that gentleman, right?
That's why he won't see us.
All we have to do is look at him
to understand it's impossible
a man like him
could have got mixed up
with that son of a bitch.
Oh, may he rest in peace.
Let's get out of here, Cat.
We might as well wait.
If I'm right...
...I'll make him spit up
all the loose change.
There's enough of that
for both of us to retire on.
Come in, gentlemen, please.
You think we overdid it?
No.
A small personal gift from Mr. Harold.
How should I put it?
A little memento of his appreciation
for what we've done for him.
In gold, mister.
Get it ready. We'll be by
in a couple of hours.
You're gonna need a little time.
Gold, huh?
- How does it feel to be rich?
- I don't know.
I'm not used to it yet. Hey, watch it.
A quarter of a dollar
and few minutes' patience,
and you'll have a picture of yourself
just as you are now
that will last centuries.
Take advantage now.
Tomorrow could be too late.
Hold still, please.
- Hold still, please!
- You know,
- I never had my picture taken.
- One, two,
- Now's a good a time as any.
- three, four, five,
- No.
- six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twe...
No, no, no, no, no. Now,
a little more to the left. No.
Now. Now. This way. Here you are.
Now, good, now. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
No, no, no. Now, don't move.
Now, that's right.
This way, you won't get tired.
Yeah, lean on it. That's it. There.
See how simple it is? Magnificent.
A stupendous sight,
but I know what's missing.
Just a minute. It costs only
a few cents more,
but wait till you see the effect.
Now, perfect.
Hold still now, please.
Just a matter of seconds.
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven...
Looking at you, I don't know
which one is the pigeon.
...nine, ten, eleven.
You moved!
Oh, my dove!
The man shot my dove!
That's the only one I have!
Forget it.
Now, why don't you get smart.
Why should I?
He ain't fooling around.
Because I say so!
Hey, you!
Come on.
Come on. Hold him down.
The suits they make nowadays,
they sure aren't worth a damn.
I've had enough fun.
Let's go get our money at the bank.
Get ourselves out of this lousy village.
- That's it.
- Little more.
Look at that, would you?
Take the rope.
They sure got nasty folks
around here.
They hang people too.
I'll repeat it for the last time.
Yes or no?
I want an immediate answer.
All right. So you're not interested.
Do you or don't you want
to understand
I'm giving you an opportunity
to save your neck
from that damned rope?
When I give my word, I keep it.
I said tonight, and tonight someone
will get you out of here.
You'll have to take care of the rest.
But if I know you, you'll find
a way to recover the money
those sons of bitches stole from me.
I lost a partner recently.
If you're interested,
you can take his place.
We were friends once.
We can be again.
It's up to you, and you know it.
- All you have to do is just...
- Where can I find them?
As far as I know, they're still in town.
They're in no hurry.
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, fella.
- It's gonna rain soon. We need it.
- Yeah, we need it.
Come inside.
I got something to tell you.
Well, why don't you boys just
sit down and have a drink.
I just had a bottle delivered
to me that'll really...
Get moving. Sooner we get
out of here, the better it is.
Come on, hurry!
I said, hurry up!
You, huh?
I wonder if it works.
Come on.
Let's go.
It works.
Pretty, isn't it?
It's like the life of a man,
beautiful while it lasts.
- I told you this afternoon...
- You told me too much.
In my opinion, you're getting old.
Once, you used to count your words.
But this afternoon,
you told me so much...
...I almost forgot to ask
about our mutual friends.
Our friends?
Still not thinking of that old story,
are you?
No. Simple curiosity.
You know...
...15 years of hard labor sort of cuts
into your social life.
What are they doing now?
Where are they, around here?
No. Paco went back to Mexico.
Years ago.
Years ago?
And Drake? What about Drake?
He settled in Fair City, near Memphis,
went into business.
- Big business, huh?
- Yes. He's gone up in the world.
But as far as you're concerned,
you don't need them.
- I'm here to help you any way I...
- I know, I know.
You're here to help me
make up for the lost time.
You told me. You told me.
- You like them?
- What?
Classy, huh?
And comfortable too.
If it weren't for these, I would've
made a mistake tonight.
I would not have noticed... this.
Instead, what do you know?
My eyes fell on this
just as I was putting my boots on.
You know, it's bad taking
too many precautions.
That's better.
You know...
...the idea of killing a deputy
with my knife
wouldn't have come from
the kind of people you sent,
but from a more refined mind.
I no sooner finish those 15 years
when I'm beaten up in a saloon
and robbed of my knife.
And while I'm asleep, that knife
winds up in somebody's chest.
Somebody I don't even know.
But that little detail, the law overlooks.
And before I know it,
I'm behind bars again.
Those two you sort of hinted
you wanted taken care of,
they must have given you
a rough time...
...if, after you get a rope around
my neck without dirtying your hands,
you suddenly change your filthy mind,
all in the name of old friendship,
you say.
Actually, it's because those two
sort of took the shine off your image.
And you had no one on hand
quick enough to restore it
by finishing them off.
Isn't that it, partner?
You keep on the side of the law.
But me, with a jailbreaking charge
and the departed soul of a deputy
hanging over my head...
"Easy to handle",
you must have thought.
You're out of your mind.
Out of my mind?
Prove it to me.
Prove to me you won't double-cross
me the way you did 15 years ago.
Or the way you did
just one month ago.
Do I make myself clear, partner?
This time, I want proof.
Concrete proof.
What proof?
Yeah... what?
There, that's proof enough for me.
Buy myself a nice little farm...
...few head of cattle. Not many.
I'll have enough income left
to live on for a hundred years.
Income.
Got any idea what income is?
You put the money in the bank,
and every month,
the bank pays you interest.
You go to sleep...
...and meanwhile,
the interest is growing.
You go fishing,
and the interest increases.
And your capital stays untouched.
You sleeping?
You'd keep quiet, maybe I could.
Takes a smart man
to understand you.
You put your hands
on a mountain of money...
...no strings attached...
...and for you, it's the most natural
thing in the world, and you sleep.
Just sleep.
Hi.
Hello, friends!
There's a rumor you just
cleaned out a bank.
It so happens I had savings
in that bank.
Never mind the jokes.
Oh, don't take it so badly.
You're both young and strong.
Me, I have to make up
for so much wasted time.
There are many things
I have to attend to.
So don't worry.
I just need a small amount.
Just enough for the bare necessities.
Well, no.
Money corrupts Man. It softens him.
So to keep you young and pure,
I think I'll take everything.
You'll thank me for this someday.
Listen, before you go,
there's one thing I'd do if I were you.
What is that?
Shoot me.
What a nice idea.
The world is too small for you to get
far enough away from me.
I'll find you sooner or later.
Listen, tiny, you must have worms
in your brain.
Cacapoulos doesn't go
around shooting people
just to have something to do.
Then give me a loaded gun.
Oh, no, I can't do that.
My grandfather always used to say,
"Even if you have a small advantage,
be careful not to lose it.
"In the best of circumstances,
you'd be considered a fool."
And I always find myself in trouble
if I don't follow
my grandfather's advice.
So long, friends!
Shoot me.
You shoot me.
A peasant.
You see? A peasant
on a dirty donkey.
And a minute later, you're lying
ass up on the ground,
without having the time
to say, "ouch".
We let ourselves be fooled
like amateurs.
My farm.
My interest sitting in the bank.
Shoot me, Cat!
Come on, shoot me!
What are you waiting for?
Shoot me. Shoot me...!
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you doing?
You gone loco?
Put down the gun, Cat.
And you save your breath.
We have 30 miles to do
before we see a living soul.
Stay here. They need
water and food, I'd say.
The murrain falls on us.
And before Jim and I can make out
what's going on,
all the bulls and cows are in pastures
with their legs straight up like pegs.
And we're left with just about nothing.
Well, we were worse off
than when me and my old lady
came here 30 years ago.
Worse off, indeed.
Without a penny
for a blind man's song.
That's how it was.
I was just thinking
of finishing myself off,
- when guess what happens.
- What happened?
A miracle, that's what happened.
- Guess who appears in front of me.
- Who appeared in front of you?
Our savior.
Oh, well, it didn't look like him.
He gets off his horse,
and he says to me,
"Hey, old man.
"You look worse than an undertaker
without a job."
So while he's eating, because
he looked hungrier than you did,
I tell him all my troubles.
Of course, I'm just letting off steam,
and he don't even seem
to be listening to me,
when all of sudden,
he comes out with a big laugh,
and he says,
"Is 5,000 enough?"
And I says, "What?"
And then he says,
"Write out a receipt.
"I have an idea that you're going
to get a loan from Cacapoulos."
Pa wanted him to stay,
but Mr. Cacapoulos is a man
who likes to see happy people
around him.
So he left with a strange man
who earns his living
walking on a rope a hundred feet
above the ground,
and he went into town
with his wagon for the fair.
If we don't hurry,
that crook won't have a cent left.
Nice to give to charity
when it's other people's money.
Quiet, please. This is very dangerous.
Thank you.
Quiet, please.
Step right over this way...
Step right up here.
Well, how about this?
What's the matter with you?
Why, you little bitch. Come here.
Get your hands off me! Please! Help!
Don't! Please let go!
Skip it.
He needs a dozen like you
before he even starts having fun.
Even if you're an idiot, I don't see
why you wanna die so young.
I'll join you if you don't mind.
All right. If somebody's ready to start.
I warned you.
He left last night.
Told us he was going all the way
to Tula on the other side of the border.
He said he had
an old account to settle.
Did he...?
Did he give you a loan too?
To tell you the truth,
he offered me one.
But I refused.
We've always been able to make it
on our own, at least until today.
You'd have done all right today too.
You certainly didn't need us
to handle those guys.
Thank you. You're very kind.
Mr. Cacapoulos, too, is very kind.
He seems to wanna
make everybody happy.
And that's very nice of him.
Except, it seems to me,
it's very hard to make
everybody happy.
It seems to me that
Mr. Cacapoulos is not very thrifty.
Well...
...I think it's about time we got going.
Looks like this is it.
You like to bet?
- This fiesta, we're paying for it.
- You can count on it.
- He dead, that one there?
- "No entiendo, señor".
No, "señor". No, not dead.
Is... He's good to us. Not dead.
No", señor".
If I could get my fingers
around his neck...
Listen, Miguel, I wanna play a joke
on those two gringos over there.
See them?
"Bienvenidos" to Tula, "señores".
Take it easy. This stuff will knock you
right out if you're not careful.
Not me.
The hell with it. It's me that's paying.
Now, then. Piece of paper, huh?
You ugly little cockroach,
I'm gonna kill you!
We can't talk in here.
Let's go outside. I can't hear you.
We got nothing to say to each other.
Just spit out my money, and fast.
And if I don't?
I wouldn't be carrying it
with me anyway.
It's no use looking for Cat.
By now, he's about ten miles
from here thinking he'll find me.
What do you mean?
Follow me.
You know, tiny, in your condition,
I could lay you out flat.
Very quickly, without any trouble.
Why don't you try.
During my travels, I was thinking.
I decided to give you back
your money.
All of it. I don't need it anymore.
Sure, you done nothing else
but spread it around.
Small change.
And anyway, I'll give you back
even that.
There's somebody here
who owes me a big debt.
To have debts owed you is one thing.
To collect them is another.
He'll pay.
All I want is you two
to leave me alone till I get it.
And then I'll give it back to you,
seeing as you care so much about it.
It seems money is nothing to you,
I guess.
You're wrong.
Once, I was convinced there was
something more important. I...
Try to imagine that you
have three friends...
...that you've shared everything
with them since you were a boy.
Even these.
Imagine, one day
you clean out a bank...
...and while you get away...
...half the town on your heels...
...one of your good friends
pulls out a gun
and shoots your horse
out from under you.
And then they shout,
"You hold them off
till we catch our breath.
"Then we'll come back and free you."
Fifteen years I waited for them.
Doing hard labor.
And the best part is,
they didn't forget.
Oh, no.
They were waiting till I got out
so they could send me straight to hell.
Lower me gently
into a nice new grave.
And put a stone on my head.
But these friends of yours...
...how many did you say there are?
Two.
There were three.
I took care of the first.
And the second?
Paco?
It's his turn tomorrow.
I don't like to look on the dark side...
...but suppose, instead of your friend
Paco, it's you who gets shot?
Would you explain to me
why I have to go through hell
just to get back what's mine?
You don't trust me?
I have another idea.
What?
If you want, you can come with me.
Sure, sure.
Why not? The two of us together.
Be easy as child's play.
Well, now, that's a wonderful idea.
Another one. Enrique Ramirez
Sanchez Cornejo y Mendoza.
The charge?
He refused the opportunity to fight
for the liberty and independence
of our great country.
For the defense.
A pig.
The jury?
Rebel.
Rebel.
He's a rebel.
Guilty.
Another one.
Ramirez Fernandez Sanchez
Eugenio y Mendoza.
Take your hat off!
Like you said, huh?
It's gonna be child's play.
Leave it to me.
- "Leave it to me", huh?
- Buddy, I didn't force you to come.
Those are my friends from Tula.
I underestimated them.
You see, some friends are
better than others.
I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
Open the gate! Open the gate!
"¡Nombre de Dios!" The gate!
Take care of that damn machine gun!
How did you manage to get
all these people together?
I just told them Cacapoulos had
a lot of money hidden somewhere.
Look how they're guarding his life.
Now drive the rebels out!
Through the gate, men!
Through the gate!
Come on, men! Follow me!
Follow me!
Cover him!
Cover him, "nombre de Dios",
cover hi...!
Where the hell is he going?
All right, come on.
Jump!
Wait, wait!
Onward, "mis hombres", on!
