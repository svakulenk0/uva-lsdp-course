For you.
And you.
And you.
What are these?
These, madam,
are STDs.
What are you talking
about, buddy?
STDs. Save the dates.
For Vivian and my wedding.
Ah, yes.
Hey, just out of curiosity,
how many people
have you given STDs to?
Lots. Like 100.
What's going on?
Uh... oh, okay. I get it.
"STD" has another meaning.
No one else
is gonna think that.
Everyone
is going to think that.
But it's sweet that your mind
didn't go there.
Thank you.
It is kinda sweet.
Will your first dance
be to
Will you be serving crabs
at the reception?
Do you have herpes?
Guys, this is my wedding.
This is important to me.
No more jokes.
You're right,
and we're sorry.
We love you, buddy.
Warts and all.
Sorry, I made
a rash decision.
I was itching to say it. Okay, I'm done.
I have an STD.
So just RSVP, or...
Yeah, the number's
right on there...
Great. Thank you.

Whoo!
Happy Tactical
Village Day.
Happy Tactical
Village Day.
Happy Tactical Village Day.
Peralta,
I'm surprised to see you
so excited about departmentally
mandated training exercises.
It's the most fun day
of the year.
Something you
wouldn't understand,
because you're not
programmed to feel joy.
Yes, but my software is due
for an exuberance upgrade.
You know, when you play along
with the robot jokes
it kind of ruins
my enjoyment of them.
Yes, I know.
Anyways, Tactical Village Day
is awesome.
We get to field test a bunch
of cool, new weapons,
and there's always
a new training situation.
Last year's was prison break.
It got super violent.
It's like being
in an action movie.
It's also a good
opportunity for us
to let off steam
and bond as a unit.
Everybody gets into it.
Needless to say, the nine-nine
has never had a perfect run.
True, but Jake has been
the finalist for coolest kill
two years in a row.
That's every precinct
sending around
their footage
and all the cops voting.
It's not that
big of a deal.
All you win is a children's
karate trophy, so...
You desperately want it,
don't you?
So badly. I will stop at nothing
to get that trophy.
I'll shoot you all
in the face if I have to!
Go team.
Gina, the D.A. needs copies
of our interrogation transcripts
from the Adams case.
Gina.
Gina.
Sorry. I was playing
Kwazy Cupcakes.
Crazy cupcakes?
"Kwazy" with a "w."
A backwards "w."
No such thing
as a backwards "w."
Yeah, there is. See?
Okay, how you play...
You just line up three cupcakes
with the same color frosting...
Ka-bam.
And this little
game of yours,
it's more interesting to you
than your work?
Yeah. Kwazy Cupcakes is a lot
more interesting than this.
Stop saying "kwazy."
And stop playing this inane
garbage. It's embarrassing.
Say it to my face.
I did.
You were looking at your phone.
Oh, cool. My B.
Great news,
I think I figured out my persona
for this year'
tactical villa..
Introducing Rex Buckingham
British secret agent,
ballistics expert,
and ladies' man.
Yeah, 'cause what woman
doesn't love a guy
who's super into
make-believe?
This whole training simulation
is make-believe.
We shoot paint at fake bad guys.
It's called acting.
Tell me how I'm any different
than George Clooney.
He has a sexy voice.
I have a sexy voice.
Champagne.
Mountain range. Hugs.
"Mountain range"?
I couldn't think
of anything sexy to say.
What? Mountain range, it's
the sexiest geological feature.
No, wait, sorry.
Deep sea trench.
I think I'm gonna
go talk to Rosa.
You try to think
of some sexier words.
Jesuit. Horticulture.
Lam-buh.
What is going on
with you two?
Come on, Boyle,
not this again.
You gotta admit
there's a spark.
How many times do I have to
say it? She's like a sister.
That's what Luke
said about Leia.
Hey, Luke didn't know!
No one knew!
Okay, Stella. All right.
Oh, no, no problem.
Okay, all right, bye.
Damn!
Our babysitter's busy
the night of Boyle's wedding.
She's gonna be in
her High School talent show.
Which she's gonna lose,
unless her talent is leaving
potato chip crumbs
all over Terry's couch.
Wait, Boyle set
a date already?
Yeah, he gave out
save the dates yesterday.
He didn't give you one?
I think he's been
avoiding me.
Hey.
Uh-oh, I hate pizza!
He didn't invite me
to his wedding,
and he's scared
like a little bitch.
Well, maybe Vivian was
uncomfortable with you coming.
Look, Boyle was in love with you
until a few weeks ago.
Oh, don't be angry.
I'm not angry.
I think it's funny.
One hot pile of boring
coming in.
Thank you, Gina.
Dismissed.
You're dismissed.
What you doing in here?
Nothing.
Okay, cool, can I just
see your phone for a second?
I may have been playing...
Crazy cupcakes.
Okay, Captain,
I think we're past the point
of you being too proud to say the "w."
Fine.
I might have been
playing...
Kwazy Cupcakes.
It's so addictive, right?
I play so much that when
I close my eyes at night,
I just see cupcakes now,
instead of my normal dizzying
array of flashing lights.
Yes, well, I have a tremendous
amount of self-control.
I don't think I'll
have any problem
resisting this silly game.
I've deleted
the application.
There. Hmm.
Does this mean
I've lost my progress?
Well, doesn't matter,
because I'm done.
The nine-nine
is in the village.
Nine-nine!
Hey, Ronnie.
They upgraded you
from bystander to perp.
That's great, man.
Thank you.
I'm gonna blow
your brains out.
Amy Santiago.
Teddy!
Hey.
Oh, my God.
It's been so long.
What are you doing here?
I'm with the eight-two now.
We're paired with you today.
Yeah. Quick. 10-54L.
Ambulance case.
Severed limb.
What is going on here?
Teddy and I met at code camp.
It was a voluntary refresher
course on police codes.
Some long nights
of intense memorizing.
It was pretty dope.
Sounds dope.
Nice to meet you.
Well, I'm gonna go sign in,
but we should catch up later.
Yeah.
Great seeing you.
You too.
Who's that guy?
Uh, that was Teddy. We went on,
like, five dates last year.
I liked him, but he was
stationed out in Queens,
so I never got to see him,
and it sort of fizzled.
Right, that's the guy you said
the lame stuff about.
Like "he's a good listener."
I'm sorry, what do you
look for in a guy?
I don't know, real stuff.
Shape of his ass.
All right.
So weird that Amy
dated that guy.
What do you care so much?
Okay, first of all,
your insinuating voice
is way too high.
It's creepy. And second,
I don't care.
I'm just curious
why she would like him.
Whatever you say.
Oh, yeah, no,
I hear it now.
Yeah, I sound like Meryl Streep
from
Oh, this is so cool.
You can shoot around corners.
I love guns. I'm gonna
make such a good dad.
Not even gonna touch that.
The Amy Santiago story.
Santiago.
Got one for ya.
Roving gang, specify direction
of travel and number in group.
At least make me work for it.
Hey, I got one.
How 'bout 10-69?
That's easy.
Message received.
And simultaneously given.
Am I right? Up top.
Got it.
Yeah.
So they got the new handguns in.
You want to check 'em out?
Totally.
Of course.
Oh, I see what happened.
I thought he was
talking to me.
And he clearly was.
Chop chop, Ted. Let's roll.
Hold down the fort.
Uh...
That's a P.U.W.
Or a portable
ultrasonic weapon.
It emits a focused beam of sound
which can disorient
and even
incapacitate a perp.
So it shoots sound?
Mm-hmm.
Is this the trigger?
Yes, but you want to be
careful with that.
Ahh... ah...
Thought it would be louder.
It's highly directional.
If it were pointed at you, you'd
be in incredible pain right now.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh...
I can taste my thoughts!
Enough, Diaz.
Oh, my God...
That's pretty cool.
Captain Holt?
Have you seen Captain Holt?
Tall, handsome gentleman
dressed like an airline pilot?
No.
Okay.
Your pants are up.
I'm coming in.
Captain...
Think you might have a little
bit of a problem here, boo.
I have this under control.
You should leave.
This is the men's room.
This is no longer a men's room.
It is now a liar's den.
I am Captain of this precinct,
and you are my assistant.
I have given you
a direct order to leave.
I do not have a problem!
If I want to play
Kwazy Cupcakes,
I will play Kwazy Cupcakes!
"Kwazy" is a difficult word
to say in anger,
I think I've made
my feelings clear.
Nice.
Have you noticed
they moved the trigger?
Real exciting finger feel.
"Finger feel"?
Really?
Nice!
Two to the chest.
Textbook shooting.
Yeah, and his
overalls fell down.
I can't believe
you would kill a farmer,
the backbone
of our nation's economy.
When it comes
to shooting patterns,
I like to go PB&J.
Penis, brain, jaw.
Nice shooting, man,
but do you think the penis
is an effective target?
Interesting fact: A man can run
half a mile with no genitals.
That's a weird thing
to know a lot about.
Hey, hey.
Okay, so I know
you're pissed at Boyle.
I told you, shooting him
with that sonic cannon
was an accident.
It's not just that.
Aah!
Oh! Ahh! Oh!
Whoops. Sorry. Net gun.
My cafe con leche!
Aah!
Sorry. Misfire.
Right in my breasts!
So many accidents.
Look, I get it if Vivian
doesn't want me to come.
But Boyle should've
said something.
We're supposed
to be friends.
We're finally
getting along.
Talk to him.
That's what friends do.
Nope, I'm gonna wait till
I'm on my deathbed,
get in the last word,
and then die immediately.
That's your plan
for dealing with this?
That's my plan for dealing
with everything.
I have 77 arguments
I'm gonna win that way.
Seems like a bad plan.
Now I have 78.
Rex Buckingham at your service.
That was majestic.
Custom kneepads to help me
win coolest kill.
What, don't tell me
old Buckingham
is the only chap here
with a signature move.
Uh, no. I'm working on a thing
where when I'm out of ammo
I release my mag and dropkick it
straight into someone's throat.
Oh! My buttholes!
Ooh...
Okay, I know you have
two bullet wounds in your butt,
but you've gotta stop
calling them your "buttholes."
You know how people hold their
guns sideways to look cool?
It got me thinking. What if you
held your gun upside-down?
You can use that.
That will never happen,
my American friend.
Eight-two's done.
Heads up.
Hey. How'd it go?
It went well.
We had a perfect run.
And not to brag,
but I think we just set
an NYPD course record
for time.
Definitely a brag.
A course record?
That is so cool.
Oh, thanks. I'm psyched.
Hey, good luck in there.
Thanks.
All right.
All right, huddle up.
This is how it's going down.
What happened
to your accent, Rex?
Forget that crap.
We're taking this seriously.
All right, on three.
Let's break that course record
and be the best precinct here.
Ready?
One, two, three!
All: Let's break that course
record and...
Yeah, I agree, it was
too many words. Let's do it!
Okay, I've got the details
for this simulation.
A group of armed men
entered an embassy
and have taken hostages.
Which embassy?
Doesn't matter.
Fine. Canada, then.
So take out the perps, clear the
civilians, rescue the hostages?
Affirmative.
This is an active
shooter situation.
You're cleared
for maximum engagement.
"Maximum engagement"?
What is this,
Jurassic Park: The ride?
Diaz and Boyle,
perimeter security.
Me and Boyle?
Yeah. Just the two of you.
Peralta and Santiago,
you're the assault team.
I'll be in the command center.
Scully, I want you
to do nothing.
Just stand next to me
and say, "yes, sarge."
Okay, sarge.
Come on, man.
All right, focus up.
We got 18 minutes, 41 seconds
to break this record.
No screwing around.
Whoa, you're really
not gonna do a character?
What about Rex "Bookinghame"?
Okay, never, ever
do an accent again.
And I am playing
a character:
A no-nonsense Detective
whose only goal
is to set this course record.
His name is Vic Kovac.
He's an ex-navy seal
who is double-crossed
and left for dead.
I don't have time
for his back-story. Sarge.
Okay, guys, and go!
Captain.
Captain.
Sorry.
I'm just about
to enter sprinkle city.
They break the game into
these idiotic worlds
to give you some false
sense of progress.
So just stop playing.
But I'm just about
to enter sprinkle city.
Gina, I've got a problem.
This game is starting
to affect my work.
Numbers three and four,
switch places.
Cupcake match.
I don't understand
why I can't stop.
I've never had a problem
controlling myself.
Do you know I love milk?
Mm, no.
Well, I do,
but it hurts my stomach.
So I haven't had milk,
a beverage I love, for 19 years.
but for some reason
I can't quit Kwazy Cupcakes?
I know what to do.
You ever play
Kwazy Cupcakes?
I love that game!
I just got up to sprinkle city.
Oh, my gosh. Interesting.
What level are you on,
Captain Holt?
Sprinkle city.
We have so much in common.
Look at that, I'm cured.
Turn around!
Clear!
Clear.
Clear.
Nice.
Okay, only three
perps left.
We might actually do this.
I like Vic Kovac so much
more than Jake Peralta.
Oh, yeah, Kovac.
Let's, uh, find the man
who stabbed my sister
and get revenge for ruining
my life and everything.
You were double-crossed
and left for dead.
I can't believe
you remembered that.
I also can't believe I didn't
go with the sister stabbing.
Emotionally,
that is much richer.
Peralta,
we got intel there's
a hostage in room 409.
Copy that.
I love how it always
smells like fresh paint here.
Reminds me of how often
I moved as a child.
No talking.
You'll give away our position.
Look out!
Come on!
That was close.
There's paint in your hair.
Okay, here it goes.
I'm pissed at you.
Oh, boy.
I thought I wanted to do this
on my deathbed, but apparently
I could die randomly
in some hallway somewhere, so...
You didn't invite me to your
wedding and it hurt my feelings.
I thought we were friends.
I'm sorry. It's just...
Vivian thought it might
be weird to invite you
because I used to be,
you know,
all-consumed by my passionate
love for you or whatever.
It's okay.
I understand.
Hey, thanks for
shooting that guy.
Hey, my pleasure.
Your pleasure?
This was a human being
you just killed.
Bill "perp" had a family.
Oh! Whoa!
Hostages are in there.
Intel says there's a couple
of heavily-armed perps
with them.
No time. We only have
a minute 12 to beat the record.
I'm going in.
Don't worry. I have a plan
on how to beat them.
Give up.
What?
Trust me. Or don't.
I'm doing it anyway.
NYPD! Don't shoot!
I'm here to surrender.
Let the hostages go
and take me instead.
Not happening.
Drop the weapons!
All right, all right,
my fingers are off the triggers.
I'm just gonna slowly
put them down in front of me.
Slowly put 'em...
Oh! Damn it!
Terry, time!
You broke the record!
Yes! Nice!
Well done.
All in a day's work,
elderly lady.
All in a day's work.
Ah, there he is!
The record is ours.
That's so amazing, Jake.
Check it out.
I got us prizes.
Sweet. "Victim."
I can't believe
your final kill
came with Scully's move.
You went upsy-downsies?
That's what I call it, because
you hold the gun upside-down.
Yes, Scully,
I went upsy-downsies.
And none of you will ever
speak of it again.
But I want to speak of it.
You looked really dumb.
Man, I feel so good.
Almost makes me
want to start
taking things seriously
all the time,
but them I'm like,
"boobs, fart, boobs, whatever."
Alright, let's go.
Drinks are on me.
Nice!
Here we go, nine-nine!
Actually, Teddy
asked me to get dinner,
so maybe I can meet up
with you guys afterwards?
Oh. Neat. Yeah.
Of course.
Cool.
Boobs. Fart.
Boobs, whatever.
So I just talked to Vivian.
I told her I really want you
to come to the wedding,
and she said okay.
Thanks. I'm excited to go.
Also, "STD" stands for
"sexually transmitted disease."
That is correct.
It is, however, very expensive
to reprint those cards,
so we're leaning into it.
Rosie Diaz,
will you accept my STD?
I look forward
to having it forever.
Mm.
Well, congratulations,
everyone, on a perfect run.
And a new course record.
And congratulations to you,
Captain,
on beating your
Kwazy Cupcakes addiction!
Okay, I had to tell them.
It's my nature.
You helped me today,
so I'll give you
a pass on
embarrassing me publicly.
Thank you.
I feel that the reason I was
so vulnerable to this game
was because technology
has evolved to the...
Yeah, I don't know.
I think it's just bright
and stupid and fun.
So fun.
So fun.
So fun.
What's going on,
Vic Kovac?
What do you think
Amy sees in Teddy?
So you do like her.
I'm just curious.
I mean, I guess
he's okay-looking.
And he's a good cop.
They're both kind of dorky
about police stuff.
Also, he set
the course record,
but that's nothing. I broke it,
like, 20 minutes later.
You want to know why she went
out with him and not you?
Yeah.
Because he actually
asked her out.
Hey, Vivian.
Rosa.
I'm here to celebrate
with the team.
Look, I'm not really
good at this stuff, but...
Thank you for inviting me
to your wedding.
I'm really happy I could come,
and I promise it won't
be weird at all.
Yeah, I'm really happy
you could come too.
'Cause I didn't think
it was gonna happen.
What do you mean?
Well, Chuck told me you were
gonna be out of town
that weekend,
and then, you know, he just told
me that your plans changed,
so, uh... so yeah,
so that's great news.
Why would it be weird?
Um, it'd be weird
'cause I'm weird.
Oh.
Whooo...
I'm leaving.
Night, everyone.
Hey, Amy.
Check it out.
No way, you won coolest kill?
Not even close.
It turns out anyone
can just buy themselves
a children's karate trophy.
Smart.
Yeah.
Hey, before you go,
I wanted to ask you something.
Of course.
I was just wondering...
Are you wearing lipstick?
Yeah, I'm going out
with Teddy again.
Does it look weird?
I called my 13-year-old niece
for makeup tips,
but I don't know
if I trust her.
She is so sexual.
You look great.
Thank you.
So what's up?
Oh. It's not important.
I just had a question
about a work thing.
But have a great date,
and we'll talk tomorrow.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
I'll help you with
your work stuff, Jakey.
Perfect.
