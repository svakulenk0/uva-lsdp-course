Greetings, my friend.
You are interested
in the unknown...
the mysterious,
the unexplainable.
That is why you are here.
And now,
for the first time...
we are bringing you the full story
of what happened.
We are giving you
all the evidence...
based only on the secret testimony
of the miserable souls...
who survived this
terrifying ordeal.
The incidents, places...
My friend, we cannot keep this
a secret any longer.
Can your heart stand
the shocking facts...
of the true story...
of Edward D. Wood,Jr.?
It's 8:1 5. We can't hold
the curtain any longer.
Cripes, what am I gonna tell the cast?
It's press night and there's no press!
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- Nah, Tommy.
That's just kiddie
spook stories.
Once you're dead,
you stay dead.
I don't know, Bill.
Out on that battlefield today,
I saw this woman dressed in white...
floating above the dunes.
Maybe it was just fatigue or maybe
it's the indignities of war.
Or maybe it's
somethin'else.
Hey, I think
I see somethin'.
I offer you mortals
the bird of peace...
so that you may change
your ways...
and end this destruction.
What a show!
Everyone was terrifiic.
Paul, your second act monologue
actually gave me the chills.
- Oh, thanks, Eddie.
- I got the early edition,
hot off the presses!
This is the big moment.
-
- Oh, what does that old queen know?
She didn't even show.
Sent her copy boy
to do the dirty work.
- Sc-rew you, Miss Crowley.
- Do I really have a face like a horse?
What does "ostentatious" mean?
Hey, it's not that bad. You can't
concentrate on the negative.
Look, he's got some
nice things to say here.
"The soldiers' costumes
are very realistic." That's positive!
- Rave of the century.
- Well, I've seen a lot worse reviews.
I've seen reviews where they didn't
even mention the costumes.
Like that last Francis the Mule picture.
It got terrible notices.
- Huge hit!
- Lines around the block.
That's right. Don't take it too
seriously. We're all doing great work.
- Do you really think so?
- Absolutely.
-
- Honey, what if I'm wrong?
- What if I just don't got it?
- Ed, it was only one review.
Orson Welles was only 26
when he made Citizen Kane.
I'm already 30.
Ed, you're still young.
This is the time in your life when
you're supposed to be struggling.
I know. But I'm scared it's not going
to get any better than this.
Oh, I hate having
to wake up this early.
Gosh, where's
my pink sweater?
I can never seem to find
my clothes any more.
Hey, big shot! Get off your ass and get
this over to the executive building.
- Sure thing, Mr Kravitz.
- Hey, Charlie, come here.
What did I tell ya about watering these
plants, eh? I want some water on 'em!
Don't sprinkle the damn things!
Soak 'em!
Hi.
All right, people, settle.
And... action!
Wow!
Look at these camels!
These are real camels!
- Gosh, where'd they get real camels?
- Hey, you!
Move it outta here, huh?
Hey, Eddie! Come in here.
I got some great new stuff to show you.
This is fantastic.
What are you gonna do with it?
- Probably file it away
and never see it again.
- Ah, it's such a waste.
Why, if I had half the chance,
I could make an entire movie
using this stock footage.
The story opens on these
mysterious explosions.
Nobody knows what's causing them,
but it's upsetting all the buffalo.
So the military are called in
to solve the mystery.
- You forgot the octopus.
- No, no. I'm saving that
for my big underwater climax.
-
- Hello.
They say he was a girl
trapped in a man's body.
- I bet it hurt when
they cut his thing off.
- Ugh!
What are you ladies
gabbin' about?
You know that Christine Jorgensen freak?
He... She... It's in Variety.
Some producer's
makin' a biopic.
Really? I didn't
read that story.
Yes, I've got
Mr Edward Wood on the line.
Could you please hold?
Mr Weiss?
Ed Wood here.
Listen, I heard about your
new project and I was curious
if you'd signed a director yet.
Oh, you haven't!
Well, if we could get together,
I could explain to you...
why I'm more qualified to direct
this than anyone else in town.
Well, I'd rather not
go into that over the phone.
All right.
Great!
I'll see you then.
Bye!
Eddie, I don't understand.
Why are you the most qualified director
for the Christine Jorgensen story?
Oh, it's just hogwash, hon.
I had to get into the door somehow.
No, I love you like a brother.
No, no, no. No, no, no.
That's a fialsehood!
Come in!
Look, when I said you could
have the western territories,
I didn't mean all 1 1 states!
I meant California, Oregon,
and what's that one on top?
Washington, yeah, yeah!
W... Oh, really?
Well, screw you!
Hi. Can I help you?
Yes. I'm Ed Wood.
I'm here about directing the
Christine Jorgensen picture.
Well, a couple of things have changed.
It ain't gonna be the
Christine Jorgensen story no more.
Goddam Variety had to print
the story before I got the rights.
- Now that bitch is asking for the sky.
- Ah, you're not gonna make the movie.
No, of course I'm gonna make
the picture. I already presold
Alabama and Oklahoma.
Those repressed Okies, they go for
that twisted, perverted stuff.
We'll just do it without the she-male.
We'll fictionalize it.
- Is there a script?
- Fuck no. But, there's a poster.
It opens in nine weeks
in Tulsa.
Well, Mr Weiss, look no further.
I'm your man.
I work fast and I'm a deal.
I write and direct. And I'm good.
I just did a play in Hollywood
and Victor Crowley himself
praised its realism.
There's about 500 guys in this town
that can say the same thing.
On the phone you said you had
some special qualifications?
Mr Weiss...
I have never told anyone...
what I'm about to tell you.
But I really want
this job.
I like to dress
in women's clothing.
You're a fruit?
No, not at all. I love women.
Wearing their clothes makes me
feel closer to them.
- You're not a fruit.
- No, I'm all man.
I even fought in W.W. Two.
Of course, I was wearing women's
undergarments under my uniform.
Ya got to be kidding me.
Confidentially, I even paratrooped
wearing a brassiere and panties.
I tell ya, I wasn't scared
of being killed, but I was
terrified of getting wounded...
and having the medics
discover my secret.
- So you think this qualifies you
to make my movie?
- Yes!
I know what it's like
to live with a secret...
and worry about what people
are gonna think of ya.
My girlfriend still doesn't know why
her sweaters are always stretched out.
Ed, you seem like a nice kid.
Look around you.
I don't hire directors with burning
desires to tell their stories.
I make movies
like Chained Girls.
I need someone with experience
who can shoot a film in four
days and make me a profit.
I'm sorry.
That's all that matters.
Can I get you
anything else, kid?
Too constrictive!
I can't even fold my arms.
Gee, Mr Lugosi,
I've never had any complaints.
This is the most uncomfortable coffin
I've ever been in.
Your selection is quite shoddy.
You're wasting my time!
- Mr Lugosi?
- I told you I don't want any
of your goddam coffins!
No, no!
I don't work here.
- Then who are you? What do you want?
- I don't want anything.
- I'm just a really big, big fan.
I've seen all your movies.
-
-Mr Lugosi, why are you buying a coffin?
-I'm planning on dying soon.
- No!
- Yes! I'm embarking on another
bus and truck tour of Dracula.
Twelve cities in ten days,
if that's conceivable.
Do you know that I saw you perform
Dracula in Poughkeepsie in 1 938?
- That was a terrible production.
Renfield was a drunk!
- I thought it was great.
You know, you're much scarier
in real life than you are in the movie.
Thank you.
I even waited outside to get your
autograph, but you never came out.
Well, I apologize. When I play Dracula,
I put myself into a trance.
It takes me much time
to reemerge.
Oh, there's my bus.
Shit, where is my transfer?
- Say, don't you have a car?
- I refuse to drive in this country.
Too many madmen.
I've got a car.
Boy, Mr Lugosi, you must lead
such an exciting life.
- When is your next picture coming out?
- I have no next picture.
You gotta be jokin'.
A great star like you, you must
have dozens of'em lined up.
Back in the old days, yes.
But now, no one gives
two fucks for Bela.
- But you're a big star.
- No more.
I haven't worked
in four years.
This business, this town,
it chews you up, then spits you out.
I'm just an ex-bogeyman.
Make a right.
They don't want the classic
horror films any more.
Today, it's all giant bugs.
Giant spiders,
giant grasshoppers.
Who would believe
such nonsense?
The old ones were much spookier;,
they had castles and full moons.
They were mythic.
- They had a poetry to them.
- Yes.
And you know what else?
The women...
The women prefer
the traditional monsters.
The women. Huh.
The pure horror, it both repels
and attracts them.
Because in their
collective unconsciousness...
they have the agony
of childbirth.
The blood...
The blood is horror.
You know,
I never thought of that.
Take my word for it.
If you want to make out
with a young lady...
you take her to see Dracula.
Eh, what a mess.
My wife of 20 years
left me last month.
- I'm not much of a housekeeper.
-
- All right, I'm coming.
I'll feed you, my darlings.
- I'd better get going.
But perhaps we could get together
again some time, Mr Lugosi.
Certainly.
But now, the children of the night
are calling me.
Uh...
- Good day.
- Good day.
Sweetie, you won't believe it.
I've got incredible news.
- You got the job!
- No, I didn't get the job.
- But something better happened.
- Better than not getting the job.
Yes!
I met a movie star.
- Somebody really big.
- Who? Robert Taylor?
No. A horror movie star.
- Boris Karloff?
- Close.
The other one.
You met...
Basil Rathbone!
Oh, to heck with you.
I met Bela Lugosi.
- Why, I thought he was dead.
- No, he's very much alive.
Well...
sort of.
He's old and frail, but he's still
Bela Lugosi and he's really nice.
- I can't even remember the last
time I saw him in a picture.
- It's a shame.
He's such a great actor
and no one uses him any more.
-So, did you get his autograph?
-No, it wasn't like that at all.
It was just the two of us and we were
talking. He treated me like a friend.
- Yeah, well, he's a bum.
- No, he's not.
Do you have any idea how much money
he made for this studio?
Dracula, The Black Cat,
The Raven.
Yeah? Well, now he's a junkie.
He don't deserve to work.
- That is not true!
- He's so great, you hire him.
Yeah, well,
I would if I could.
-  Trick or treat!
-  The house looks like
they have lots ofi kids.
Ooh, those eyes.
He gives me the willies.
Uh, I hate it when
she interrupts the picture.
She doesn't show 'em
the proper respect.
I think she's a honey.
Look at those jugs.
But he stood me up
at the restaurant.
I guess I shouldn't have
picked a steak house.
And then I went out with the Wolfi Man.
Ugh! What an evening.
- I didn't know whether
to kiss him good night...
- Vampira...
you will come under
my spell.
You will be
my slave of love.
My gosh, Bela!
How do you do that?
You must be double-jointed.
And you must be Hungarian.
Vampira, look at me.
Look into my eyes.
You're watching our Halloween
movie, White Zombie...
starring Bela Lugosi,
John Harron, Madge Bellamy...
and a bunch of other people
I've never heard of.
I'm very tired.
I need to take my medicine.
- Do you want me to get it for you?
- No.
Thank you, Eddie.
I'll be all right.
¢Ü¢Ü
-
-  Oh, shit.
I feel much better!
-
- Children! I love children!
Trick or treat!
Aren't you scared,
little boy?
I'm going to drink
your blood.
You're not a real vampire.
Those teeth don't firighten me.
How about these?
Hey, how'd you do that?
Dentures.
Lost my pearlies in the war.
So, what was the important news you
couldn't tell me on the phone, again?
I started thinking about what
you were saying about how your
movies need to make a profit.
What is the one thing, if you put it
in a movie, it'll be successful?
- Tits.
- No, better than that. A star.
Kid, you must have me
confused with David Selznick.
I don't make major motion pictures;
I make crap.
Yes! But if you take that crap and put
a star in it, then you've got something.
- Yeah. Crap with a star.
- No, something better!
Something impressive.
Maybe the biggest money-maker
you've ever had.
Fine, all right.
You may be right,
but it doesn't frickin' matter.
I can't afford a star,
so what are we even talkin' about?
All right. What if I told you
you could have a star for $ 1,000?
Who?
- Lugosi?
- Yes! Lugosi!
- Isn't he dead?
- No, he's not dead.
He lives in Baldwin Hills.
I met him recently and he really wants
to be in our movie.
Why would Lugosi want
to do a sex change flick?
Because he's my friend!
All right, fine!
You can direct it.
I want a script in three days.
We start shooting a week firom Monday.
Mr Weiss, thank you so much. You won't
regret it. I won't let you down.
But Bunny, you're perfect for this job.
You know these people.
I need all the transsexuals
and transvestites I can get.
No, I don't care if they're not actors.
I want realism!
- I want this film to tell the truth.
-
Coming!
I've waited all my life for this shot,
and I'm not gonna blow it.
- Eddie, you got a new movie for me, eh?
- Yes!
It's gonna be a great picture and you'll
love your character. Have a seat.
Listen, Bunny?
Bela's here. I gotta go.
Listen, hit the bars, work some parties,
and get me transvestites!
I need transvestites!
All right. Bye.
Eddie, what kind
of a movie is this?
Well, it's about how people
have two personalities:
the side they show to the world, and
then the secret person they hide inside.
Like Jekyll and Hyde. I've always
wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde.
I'm looking forward to this production.
Well, your part's
a little different.
You're like the god that looks over all
the characters and oversees everything.
I don't understand.
You control everyone's fate.
You're like the puppetmaster.
- Ah, so I pull the strings!
- Yes, you pull the strings.
"Pull the strings."
I like that!
Honey!
I got a little surprise
for you.
Wipe off your hands.
- I finished my script.
-  Oh!
Ed, I'm so proud of you!
I'll read it as soon
as I get home.
Well, I'd really like
to know what you think.
Why don't you go in the bedroom
and take a look? I'll wait.
Go ahead.
Take your time.
So that's where
my sweater's been.
How long have you
been doing this?
Since I was a kid.
My mom wanted a girl, so she
used to dress me in girlie clothing.
Just became a habit.
Jesus Christ!
And you never told me?
Well, this is my way
of telling you.
What, by putting it in a fucking script
for everyone to see?
What kind of sick mind
operates like that?
And what about this, this
so-called Barbara character...
that's obviously me?
I mean, this is our life.
It's so embarrassing!
- Of course it is. That's why
you should play the part.
- Oh, you got nerve, buddy.
- It's a darn good role.
- That's not the issue!
God, how can you act so casual
when you're dressed like that?
It makes me feel comfortable.
Oh, just like in the script.
Exactly.
So, what do you say?
Do we break up?
Or do you want to make
the movie with me?
They make you tall, and you're flashy.
They want that.
Okay. But they want professionalism,
so nix on the Nelly...
without losing naivete,
okay?
Now, the good news is you're
probably going to get hired
because you look like peggy Lee.
But I don't want anybody else
to resent that, okay? Please?
'Cause there's enough
for everybody, exotics too.
All right, because if you're not
going to smile, please don't bother.
You'll embarrass me.
This is George Weiss. He's done
some very important things;
he's a nice person to know.
- An important person to know.
- I thought you were gonna
make a sex change film!
- It's still a sex change film.
- Yeah! Five pages before it ends!
- The rest is about some schmuck
who likes angora sweaters!
- I don't think he's a schmuck.
What about this title? My poster says,
I Changed My Sex.
So change the poster.
Trust me, you'll be better off.
This story's gonna grab people.
It's about this guy, he's crazy about
this girl, but he likes to wear dresses.
Should he tell her? Should he not
tell her? He's torn. This is drama!
Fine! Shoot whatever
baloney you want.
Just make sure
it's seven reels long.
Testing.
Excuse me. Can I get
everyone's attention, please?
Could you gather around?
I've got something to say.
Everybody, we're about to embark on
quite a journey: four days of hard work.
But when it's over, we'll have a picture
that'll entertain, enlighten...
and maybe even move
millions ofi people.
Excuse me, Eddie. I don't mean to
interrupt. I'm worried about the light.
Good thinking. All right, we'll talk
about days three and four later.
Let's get that first shot off. Scene 1 7,
Glenda looking in the window.
-
-  And... action!
And... cut!
- Print that! Let's move on!
- Don't you want a second take
for protection?
What's to protect?
It was perfect! Come on!
Hey! Cops!
We don't have a permit.
Run!
Come on.
Let's go.
-  What's going on
with these revised pages?
-  Mr Lugosi's here.
Oh, my God!
Mr Lugosi's here!
Everyone!
Everyone!
Everyone, come on.
Come in here.
Listen.
When he walks onto the stage,
treat him normal.
I know Bela Lugosi's a world-famous star
and you're all very excited...
but look,
we are professionals.
So, just treat him with respect.
Everything will be all right.
Bela!
Great to see ya! 8:00 on the dot.
Right on time.
- I'm always on time.
- Ofi course you are.
We've got a big day
planned fior you.
But fiirst we're gonna
start out kinda easy with you
in that armchair over there.
Then once you're up to speed
and cookin', we'll reset and
bring in the lab equipment.
- Eddie?
- Huh?
- What about my money?
- Huh? Oh.
What are you people doing?
Get back to work!
All right, people.
Let's get ready.
Mr Lugosi,
I know you're very busy...
but, um, can I have
your autograph?
Certainly.
You know which movie of yours I love,
Mr Lugosi? The Invisible Ray.
You were great
as Karloff's sidekick.
Karloff?
Sidekick?
Fuck you!
Karloff does not deserve
to smell my shit!
That limey cocksucker
can rot in hell fior all I care!
-What happened?
-How dare that asshole bring up Karloff?
You think it takes talent
to play Frankenstein?
It's all make-up and, and, grunting.
I agree.
Bela, I agree 1 00%.
Now, Dracula, that's a role
that requires talent.
Of course!
Dracula requires presence.
It's all in the eyes
and the voice...
- and the hand.
- That's right. That's right.
You seem a little agitated. You wanna
go outside and get some air?
Bullshit! I'm ready now.
Roll the camera!
We're rolling.
- Sound. Speed.
- Scene 9 7, take one. Mark.
Action.
Beware.
Beware.
Beware of the big,
green dragon...
that sits on your doorstep.
He eats little boys...
puppy dog tails...
and big, fat snails.
Beware.
Take care.
Beware.
Wait!
Pull the string!
Pull the string!
Cut.
Perfect.
But Georgie, I'm proud. I wrote,
directed and starred in it...
just like Orson Welles did
in Citizen Kane.
Yeah, well, Orson Welles didn't
wear angora sweaters, did he?
How can you just walk around like that
in firont ofi all these people?
Well, hon, nobody's bothered but you.
Look around.
Ed, this isn't the real world!
You've surrounded yourself
with a bunch of weirdos.
Oh, say it a little louder.
I don't think Bela heard you.
Dolores.
I need your help.
My mind's in a muddle,
like in a thick fiog.
I thought I could stop
wearing these things.
I tried.
Honestly, I tried.
Glen.
I don't fully understand...
but maybe together
we can work this out.
Music swells.
Cut and print!
-
- It's a wrap.
How do you do?
I'm here to see Mr Feldman.
What's your name?
Edward D. Wood,Jr.
He's in the
executive building.
- You can park in the reserved section.
- Thanks very much.
- Please, sit down.
- Thanks.
So, what are you bringing me?
Looks like you got some fiilm cans.
Well, some people bring their resumes.
I've brought my own movie.
Really.
Well, good for you.
I just shot this baby for
Screen Classics. It opens next week.
Screen Classics?
No, I don't know them.
There's something
you should know.
Nobody in town has seen this
picture, so I'm giving you
first crack at my talents.
Thank you.
And I'm anxious to see it.
So, what's up next
for you?
I don't believe in thinking
small, so I've got a whole slate
of pictures for you.
You ready?
Okay.
"The Vampire's Tomb."
"The Ghoul Goes West."
And...
"Doctor Acula."
Doctor Acula?
I don't get it.
"Doctor...
Racula."
Oh, I get it.
I don't like it.
But it'll star Bela Lugosi.
Bela Lugosi? Lugosi's
all washed-up. What else you got?
Well, l-I do have...
another project.
I wasn't going to
tell you about it.
Lugosi's in it,
but it's a small part.
The lead is an ingenue.
A sterling, young actress...
Dolores Fuller.
The title of the film:
"Bride Of The Atom"!
Ah.
Atomic age stuff, huh?
I like it.
I like it.
I tell you what, Mr Ward. Why don't
you leave your film cans with me.
And my associates and I will
take a look at your little opus...
and maybe we can do
some business together.
Take care.
Beware.
Pull the string!
Pull the string!
What the hell is this?
- Is this an actual movie?
- It can't be!
Give this man satin undies,
a dress, sweater and skirt...
or even the lounging outfiit
he has on...
- and he's the happiest
human being in the world.
- Wait a minute.
-
- Wait a minute. That guy in the dress.
That's the guy I met today.
Oh, this has got to be
a put-on.
These things are his comfiort.
This is probably another
one of Billy Wellman's practical jokes.
Hejust entered the street dressed in
the clothes he so much desires to wear.
But, only ifi he
really appears fiemale.
- long hair, make-up, clothing,
the actual contours ofi a girl.
- Oh, God!
Most transvestites do not want
to change their lifie, their bodies.
This is funny.
This is funny.
Thank you.
Georgie, I thought Glen Or Glenda?
was opening this week. Where's the ads?
Where's the ads? The ads are in Alabama,
Indiana, Missouri, you schmuck!
It ain't gonna play in L.A.!
-Why not?
-Nobody wants to see this piece of shit!
- Hey, you can't talk
that way about my movie!
- I wish it was your movie!
I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever
made into making this stink bomb!
And if I ever see ya again,
I'll kill ya!
Hello?
Georgie?
- Guess where I'm going next week?
- I don't know. Where?
Mexico.
- Guess what I'm doing when I get there.
- I don't know. Lie on a beach.
Wrong. I'm getting my first series
of hormone injections.
When those girls kick in...
they're gonna take out my organs
and make me a woman.
- Are you serious?
- It's something I've wanted
to do for a long time.
But it wasn't until I saw your movie
that I realized I have to take action!
- Goodbye, penis!
- Would you please keep it down.
The "Super Swedish Angel,"
Tor Johnson!
My gosh, look at that guy.
He's a mountain!
And after I'm a woman,Jean-Claude
and I are going to be married.
- I'm going to be a June bride.
- He's a monster.
Can you imagine what that guy
would look like in a movie?
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah!
Mmm. More neck.
- Mr Johnson, congratulations
on your victory.
- Thank you.
- Did you bring my water?
- No, I'm not the water boy.
I'm a movie director.
- Movies? Like the Mickey Mouse?
- Sure.
- I'll get you next week!
- Yeah, right. In your dreams!
Tor...
Uh, Mr Johnson.
- You ever fancy the notion
of becoming an actor?
- Not good-looking enough.
Well, I think
you're quite handsome.
Do my toes.
So, anyway, I've got this new script,
Bride Ofi The Atom.
And there's a part
I believe you're ideal for.
Lobo. He's tough,
he's a brute.
But he's got a good heart. At the end
of the picture, he saves the girl.
I like! When do movie shoot?
Hopefully, very soon.
I'm just waiting for the final okay from
my good pal at Warners, Mr Feldman.
- Wood Productions.
- Eddie, help me.
- Bela?
- Eddie, please come over.
Bela?
Bela?
Bela!
Bela!
Bela?
What happened?
Eddie.
I didn't feel well.
- Come on, let me get you
to the hospital.
- No hospital.
Just take me
to the couch.
- Should I call a doctor?
- No.
This happens all the time.
Is there anything I can get for you?
Water or a blanket?
Goulash.
I don't know how to make goulash.
Bela, what's in
the needle?
Morphine.
With a Demerol chaser.
Oh, Eddie.
Eddie, I'm so broke.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
Don't worry, Bela.
I won't let you down.
Mr Feldman?
Ed Wood.
Yeah, listen, I haven't been able
to get through, so I just showed up.
Yeah!
Right out front.
So, we gonna be
working together?
Really?
Worst film you ever saw.
Well, my next one
will be better.
Hello. Hello.
I'm no good.
Oh, Ed, it was just
one man's opinion.
Bela needs a job.
I can't even get a film going.
Of course I can't.
I made the worst movie of all time.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
All I wanna do
is tell stories.
The things that I find interesting.
Well, maybe you're not
studio kind of material.
Maybe you just need
to raise the money yourself.
The movie is called
Bride Ofi The Atom.
It will star Bela Lugosi.
There are quarter shares
available at $ 1 5,000 each.
Yes, that's right.
The Bela Lugosi.
He's still alive.
Huh? Is he available
Friday night?
Well, gee, I suppose so.
Why?
-
- "Greetings, I am the Count."
"Greetings, I am Slick Slomopavitz,
Seeker of Adventure.
"Audience laughs, applauds.
'Say, that's a kooky place to sleep."'
- "It is my home."
- "'Oh, tract housing, huh?' Laugh.
- You need a new real estate agent."
-
"I beg to differ.
This casket incap...
incarpertate..."
No, Bela,
that's "incorporates."
Look, why don't you just say,
"This casket has..."
How do they expect a Hungarian
to pronounce this dialogue?
This... This live television
is madness!
Furthermore, I predict...
by April 1 9, 1 9 70...
I predict... men will
have colonized Mars.
Millions of people
will live there.
Wow!
Ain't that somethin'?
And now we take you
to a castle in Transylvania.
Watch out. The landlord's
a real pain in the neck.
Greetings!
I am the Count!
Greetings, pal! I'm Slick Slomopavitz,
Seeker of Adventure!
-
- Hey, what a kooky place to sleep.
Kind of reminds me of my house.
What a dump!
Some places got a Murphy bed;
this place got a Murphy shower.
I still don't know where
to hang the towels.
I beg to differ.
Beg to differ? A bloodsucker, right?
I'm talkin' about my towels.
Greetings!
I... am the Count.
- Damn!
-
A bum is what he is. I told you
we should've got Karloff!
- Ah, don't worry about it, Bela.
You're better than all this.
- I never said I could ad-lib.
- Forget it! We'll make our own movie
and you'll be a big star again.
- Aha!
Mr Lugosi, it is an unparalleled
privilege to meet you, sir.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Criswell.
It's a pleasure.
Ahh, cheer up. Don't lose heart
over what happened tonight.
I predict... your next project will
be an outstanding success!
Wow!
And who may you be?
- Edward D. Wood,Jr.
- Ahh!
- The director of Glen Or Glenda?
- How'd you know?
I am Criswell.
I know all.
-
-
-
- And bingo! Thank you,
thank you, thank you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis.
Ed, uh, another whisky.
Dagmar, a rum and coke?
Moustapha and King are Chablis.
Bela, would you like a wine?
No.
I never drink... wine.
Say, Cris, how'd you know we'd be
living on Mars by 1 9 70?
- I guessed.
- Really?
I made it up.
It's horse shit.
Eddie, there's no such thing
as a psychic.
People believe my folderol
because I wear a black tuxedo.
- It's that easy?
- Eddie, we're in show biz.
It's all about razzle-dazzle,
appearances.
If you look good and you talk well,
people will swallow anything.
We are going to have the most terrifying
monster ever seen on film.
A ghastly creature created
from an atomic mutation!
I don't like
scary movies.
I like the ones
with love stories.
That's just what this movie is:
a heartbreaking romance.
You're quite a specimen.
- And you're going to be in the picture?
- Yeah. I play Lobo.
I predict Bride Ofi The Atom will be
the biggest moneymaker of all time.
And this is lovely starlet Dolores
Fuller, who will play Janet Lawton.
My pleasure, ma'am. Now,
how much will this picture cost?
Well, in a normal studio it'd be
about a million bucks...
with all their wasteful overhead
and fancy offices.
But we're more efficient, so we could
bring it in at about 70 grand.
Oh. Well, I shall
certainly consider it.
-  Well, goodbye.
-  Good night, Ed. Keep in touch.
Goodbye.
Well, Eddie, how'd we do?
We didn't make a nickel.
I cannot believe I'm in Hollywood.
- You know, Daddy didn't
want me to move out here.
-  Uh-huh.
Ma'am, your bill
comes to $ 2.20.
Oh. Uh, okay.
I hope you don't mind...
but all I have is a fiifty;
I just came firom my banker's.
- That's all right.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
You just moved here?
Yes. Hollywood is,
oh, so exciting.
- Isn't it?
-
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
I'm Loretta King.
Edward D. Wood,Jr.
-  Hi.
Would you like some water?
- No!
No water.
No liquids.
I'm terribly
allergic to them.
You know, I work in Hollywood.
I'm a producer.
Really? Wow!
I would love to be
involved in that.
Is that right?
Well, maybe I can help you out.
Have you ever thought about
investing in a motion picture?
Perhaps a small amount of money.
How much do your motion pictures cost?
Well, my new one, I think,
would be about $60,000.
That's all? That seems very reasonable
for an entire picture.
Would you...
Would you like to, uh...
- have a look at the... at the photoplay?
- Oh, sure.
Oh, my.
This is very interesting.
Say, do you think it would be possible
for me to maybe play one of these parts?
Oh, you want to be an actress too.
Well, of course.
There's a couple of parts I can think of
right now that you might be perfect for.
There's, uh, the secretary in the
newspaper office, the file clerk, um...
Hmm. Those sound kind of small.
Here's one that looks good...
Janet Lawton.
I'd sure like to play her.
-Janet Lawton.
- Yes.
Janet Lawton is clearly
the part to play.
Can't you just see me
in the part?
Yes!
You'd be perfect.
You bastard!
You two-timing,
dress-wearing son of a bitch!
Honey, it was the only way
I could get the movie made!
Who do you think's
been paying the rent?
Who's been helping you type your scripts
and do all your grunt work?
- I am sorry!
What did you want me to say?
- You were supposed to say...
"No. I wrote that part for
my girlfriend Dolores!"
Snowball, there are
plenty of other parts.
Like what?
- The secretary, the file clerk.
- Aaaaah!
You... asshole!
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory,
so it should be real impressive...
just like one of those
"Mad Scientist" movies.
I want test tubes, beakers and one
of those electrical things that buzzes.
- You mean a Tesla coil?
- Fine. Whatever. Hop to it!
Right! Right.
- Eddie?
- Yes?
- Which dress do you like better?
- Hmm. I don't know.
Say, Bill, which dress works better
for you, the red one or the green one?
- Which one is the red one?
- What do you mean?
I mean, I can't see the difference;
I'm colour blind.
But I kinda like
the dark grey one.
At Universal, we used to shoot one
or two scenes a day.
But Eddie can knock off
twenty, thirty.
- He's incredible!
-  And... action!
Okay, you're Dr Eric Vornoff...
and you're upset.
You've worked very hard
on this experiment and you
don't want to see it fail.
N-No, you're not
that upset.
You wanna keep moving.
You wanna go through that door.
And... cut!
Beautiful.
Print it. Let's move immediately
to scene 52.
- Tor, you in place?
-  Yeah.
- Great. Roll camera!
- Rolling. Slate.
- Cue rainstorm.
-
And... action, Tor.
Okay.
You're Lobo.
You're upset.
You've worked very hard helping
Dr Vornoff with this experiment.
You don't wanna
see it fail.
No, no.
You're not that upset.
You wanna keep moving.
You've got to get through that door.
And cut!
Perfect!
- Print it. Let's move on.
- Don't you wanna do another take, Ed?
Looks like big baldy had a little
trouble gettin' through the door.
No, it's fine.
It's real.
You know, in actuality, Lobo would have
to struggle with that problem every day.
All right, people, let's get ready.
Actors! I must have my actors!
There you are. Loretta, Tor,
I wanna explain this scene;
it's a little complicated, but...
- Bela, you'll be sitting there. Okay?
-
I'm not getting near
that goddam thing.
- One of them burned me
on The Return Ofi Chandu.
- All right.
- Then you'll be sitting there.
- Good.
Great. All right, gang,
here's the scene.
Loretta, you're in a trance; you glide
in and get on the operating table.
Now, Tor, you're supposed to tie her
down, but you have an angora fetish...
and when you rub that swatch
of angora, it makes you refuse.
So then Bela has to discipline you.
All right? Great! Let's do it!
Action!
Strap her to the table.
Do as I command you!
- I'll teach you to disobey me!
- Aaaargh!
- You will obey!
- Uhhhh!
- Strap her in!
- Uhhhh!
Strap her in!
I command you!
- Wood! Your cheque bounced.
- I'll get you the money later.
- No, I need it now.
-  I'll teach you to disobey me!
Cut!
I am terribly sorry to bother you
while you're shooting...
but the guy that owns the stage
needs his money.
Well, then, you should
pay him, shouldn't you?
Yes. Exactly.
I kind of need it now.
W-What are you looking at me
like that for?
I already gave you
my three hundred.
Right.
And now I need
the other sixty thousand.
What other sixty thousand?
The other sixty thousand
you said you'd give to me.
You misunderstood, Eddie.
I gave you everything I have in
the world... three hundred dollars.
Well, here we go again.
Let me tell ya,
ya can't lose.
It's scary. And if you don't like that,
it's romantic.
Bela Lugosi will portray
Dr Eric Vornoff.
And lovely, lovely, lovely
ingenue Loretta King...
is reporter Janet Lawton.
- I don't know. Lugosi looks pretty old.
- Huh?
Which role
does Vampira play?
Vampira?
Why do you ask?
She's standing
right over there.
Well, she plays...
Excuse me one minute.
-
- Pardon me. Miss Vampira?
-Yes?
- You don't know me, but I'm Ed Wood.
I'm a film producer and I'm currently in
production on a science fiction piece...
with Bela Lugosi and Swedish
wrestler Tor Johnson.
I don't understand.
Do you want my autograph?
No.
No, l... I think my film
is perfect for you.
Want me to show it on my TV programme.
I have nothing to do with that.
- You should call the station
manager at Channel 7.
- No, no. No, no, no, no.
I don't want you to show the movie,
I want you to be in it. Let me explain.
We started shooting, but after
three days we got shut down.
Now we're having a backers party
to raise some more money.
So I thought perhaps you'd like
to come over just to say "howdy"
to some of the backers.
Look, I'm with some friends
and we're about to eat.
Please! It would
just take one second.
Come over and meet the backers. There
is a really nice dentist firom Oxnard.
Look, buddy, I've got real offers
from real studios.
I don't need to blow some dentist
for a part. Forget it.
Miss Vampira!
- Please.
- Ohh! Let's go.
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
Let's get out of here.
Yeah, I think
you're right.
Thank you, folks, for comin' tonight,
but we better go.
And then Dr Vornoff
falls into the pit...
and his own octopus
attacks and eats him.
- The end.
- Whew!
- Well, that's quite a story.
- Yes.
So, uh, you made the movie...
and now you wanna
make it again?
No.
We shot ten minutes of the movie, and
now we're looking for completion funds.
Oh, son, you're too vague.
-
- Billy Bob!
You're cuttin' 'em
too lean.
Mr McCoy.
- How can I make you happy?
-
Okay.
Two things.
Number one: I want the movie
to end with a big explosion.
Sky full of smoke.
Yes.
But it ends with Dr Vornoff
falling into the pit.
Not any more.
Number two.
I got a son.
He's a little slow,
but a good boy.
And somethin' tells me
he'd make a helluva leadin' man.
Sounds perfect.
This is unbelievable.
I woulda bet a million bucks that
Ed wouldn't finish this picture.
Yeah, well, it ain't finished yet, kid;
anything can happen.
Stay out of
scratching distance.
- Poodle, you made it. I wasn't
sure you got my message.
- Well, of course I made it.
- Today's the file clerk's big scene.
- That's right.
I see the usual gang of misfits
and dope addicts are here.
-  Janet, I want you...
- Say, who's the lug?
Str... I want you staying away
from the old Willows place.
Why, that's Tony McCoy. He will be
portraying Lieutenant Dick Craig.
-
- Really.
- How much money did he put up?
- None. But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Hmm. Wood Productions,
the mark of quality.
Listen, the movie's getting made;
that's all that matters.
- Hello, Harry.
- Oh, hi, Dolores.
Oh!
You're Dolores.
I've heard so much about you.
I'm Loretta King.
Oh, here, take the chair.
Oh, don't be silly.
Let Harry finish.
You still need
some more work.
No. I'm finished.
- All I needed was a touch-up.
- Hmm. That mole still shows.
Uh, ladies!
You both look fine.
Why don't we talk
about the scene?
Okay,Janet Lawton
has just discovered...
that Dr Vornoff bought
the old Willows estate...
so now she wants to prove that
all the monster stories are true.
Well, Eddie,
what's my motivation?
You're the file clerk. You're running
into the next room and bump into Janet.
What is our relationship?
Are we good friends, or is she
just a casual acquaintance?
Dolores, I have five days
to complete this picture.
Don't get goofy on me.
Action!
- Hi,Janet.
- Oh, hi, Marge.
-Janet, still on the monster hunt?
- What do you think?
I think the boss has been
looking for you all day.
Something about the police wanting
those monster stories 86'd.
- You've got the whole town in a panic.
- I can't hear you.
- I said, you've got the who...
- I know what you said,
but I can't hear you.
I get it.
See ya later.
And... cut!
That was perfect.
Of course it was.
Bra-vo!
Bravo!
- Magnifiico.
- Cris, you made it. Thanks a lot.
Naturally. Always happy to help
with a little larceny.
All right, everybody,
that's it for today.
The prop crew has a little errand
to run. Paul. Connie.
Darn. I thought they kept this open.
Lobo will fiix.
Good boy.
-  Wow!
-  This place
gives me the creeps.
- Let's get the hell outta here.
- Not so fast. Not 'til we get it down.
There it is.
paul, go unhook it.
Right.
Fantastic.
It's beautifiul.
- You sure this is gonna work?
- Yes.
-
- You sure?
Yes, hurry. Do it.
My God!
We killed him.
Tor?
Better than wrestling.
Lights!
"Now, Janet, I want you stayin'away...
"firom that old Willows place.
I want...
"Now,Janet, I w...
- Great.
- "I want you...
- Connie!
- I want you staying away..."
- The octopus has to live in the lake.
- This is kind of a stream.
No!
It has to be underwater.
Let me look at this.
Okay.
Go set up
by the lake.
Eddie.
I'm so tired.
I don't know if I can handle
a night shoot.
- Nonsense. You look great.
-
All right, look.
Why don't you have a nice nap and
we'll shoot around you a little while.
- Thanks, buddy.
- You're welcome.
All right, you kids.
Hey, this is looking
fantastic!
Paul, where's
the octopus motor?
- What octopus motor?
- To make his legs move.
Don't blame me! You didn't say anything
about a motor when I was on the ceiling!
What's he talking...
Paul lost
the octopus motor.
All right,
let's shoot this fucker.
Great.
Where do I go?
- You'll be fighting with the octopus.
- Out there?
- Yes.
- What happened to the stream?
Well, this is gonna
look a lot better.
We have to match it to the stock footage
of the octopus underwater.
Aw, for Christ's sake.
Ehh.
- Goddam, it's cold!
- It'll warm up once you're in it.
Fuck you!
You come out here!
Hey!
Throw me that whisky!
Ahh. How do you
turn this on?
Well... somebody misplaced
the octopus motor...
so when you get in there and fight
with him, shake his legs around.
Looks like he's killin' ya.
Okay.
You know I turned down
Frankenstein?
- What?
- After I did Dracula...
the studio offered me Frankenstein,
but I turned it down.
part wasn't sexy enough.
Too degrading
for a big star like me.
Bela... I have 25 scenes
to shoot tonight.
Oh. Sorry.
Don't let me slow you down.
Okay. All right.
All right.
All right,
let's put it on film!
-  Camera!
-  We're rolling!
- Sound!
- Ed, we don't have sound.
Oh.
And... action!
And... cut!
That was perfect!
Come on!
Come on, troops!
Have a nice cup o' joe,
you'll feel much better.
All right.
All right, Harry.
Mr Wood? I only got one hour
of sleep last night.
Yeah, well, I got no sleep, and I feel
great. Go get' em, kid, go get 'em.
- I'm gettin' too old for this.
- Great work, Bill.
Go ahead.
Go get 'em.
Be careful.
Don't hurt him.
Don't scratch
the tentacles.
Bela...
I wanna thank you again
for last night.
That's fine, Eddie.
All in the line of duty.
No, no, I want you to know how much
I appreciate all you've done for me.
A great man like yourself
shouldn't have to be wandering
through the muck at 4:00 a.m.
Well, there are not a lot of fellas
I'd do it for.
Say, I wrote something
special for ya.
I got to thinkin' about all
the sacrifices you've made and l...
Well, I wrote you a...
a new final speech.
Well, this is
quite a scene, Eddie.
I know it's a lot to give you
at the last minute, Bela, but...
These lines...
I'll have no problem
remembering.
Great.
All right, kids,
let's knock 'em dead.
My dear
Professor Strowski...
twenty years ago I was banned
from my homeland.
I was classed as a madman, a charlatan.
Outlawed in the world
ofi science...
which previously
honoured me as a genius.
Now here...
in this forsaken
jungle hell...
I have proven
that I am all right!
Yes!
The authorities have learned
how correct your findings were.
So I am here...
to bring you home.
Home?
I have no home.
Hunted.
Despised.
Living like an animal.
The jungle is my home.
But I shall
show the world...
that I can be its master!
I shall perfect
my own race of people...
a race
of atomic supermen...
that will conquer
the world!
Cut.
That's a wrap.
Glen Or Glenda?
Now, that was
a hell of a picture.
Yeah, but this new one is gonna be
a million times better.
Is that possible?
¢Ü¢Ü
Mr Bunny, what's wrong?
I heard you were
becoming a lady.
Oh, that.
Mexico...
was...
a nightmare.
We got into a car accident;
he was killed.
Our luggage...
was stolen.
The surgeon
turned out to be...
a quack.
If it hadn't been
for these men...
I don't know...
how I would've...
survived.
-
-
¢Ü¢Ü
Oh, wow!
¢Ü¢Ü
You people are insane!
You're wasting your lives
making shit!
Nobody cares!
These movies are terrible!
Dolores!
Ed, it's over.
I need a normal life.
- Did you really mean
those things you sa...
- I'm tired of living like this.
- But, Poodle...
- I just stuck it out so
you could finish your movie...
and now that's it's done,
so am I.
Ooh, that was
so scary, it gave me goose bumps.
No, dummy, I didn't say "goose,"
I said "goose bumps."
Well, be sure to join me next week
for The Mummy's Curse.
Until then,
pleasant nightmares.
-
-
-  Okay,
fiolks, we're ofifi the air.
-  That was a good show.
God, this show
needs better jokes.
- You got a phone call.
- Who is it?
I don't know.
- Hello.
- Vampira? Ed Wood here.
- Who?
- Ed Wood.
-Remember, I met you at the Brown Derby?
-Oh, yeah, you.
Listen, I was wondering if you'd like to
go out sometime, grab some dinner maybe.
- You mean a date?
I thought you were a fag.
- No, I'm just a transvestite.
So, how's about
Friday night?
Look, you seem like a nice guy,
but you're just not my type.
But keep in touch. Let me know
when your movie opens.
-
- Hello?
Eddie, help me.
Bela?
-
- Bela.
-
- Bela!
What do you want?
You called me.
Remember?
What are you doing,
Bela?
I'm going
to kill myself.
-
- My gosh, what happened?
Eddie.
I got a letter
from the government.
They're cancelling
my...
unemployment.
It's all I've got.
Without it,
I can't pay the rent.
Don't you have
any savings?
Eddie, I'm obsolete.
I have nothing
to live for.
Tonight, I shall die.
Eddie!
- You should come with me.
-
- I don't think that's such a good idea.
- It's a wonderful idea.
It'll be wonderful!
We'll be at peace!
In the afterlife, you don't have
to worry about finding work.
Bela...
I'm on your side.
Gimme the gun.
If you give me the gun...
I'll make you a drink.
What are you drinking,
Bela?
Formaldehyde.
Straight up,
or on the rocks?
Eddie.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Don't worry, Bela.
- I'm sorry, Eddie.
- Everything will be okay.
Oh, my goodness,
you gave me the willies!
You look like
that Dracula guy.
My name is Bela Lugosi...
and I wish
to commit myself.
For what reason?
I have been a drug addict
for twenty years.
I need help.
Is that angora?
Um, yes.
Don't you think angora
has a tactile sensuality...
lacking
in all other clothing?
Yeah, I suppose.
It is awfully
expensive.
Well, it's made from
specially-bred rabbits...
that live
in the Himalayas.
Say, what are you,
an angora wholesaler?
No.
No.
I'm in pictures.
I'm a director, writer,
actor and producer.
Aw, come on.
Nobody does all that.
Oh, yes, they do.
Two people.
Orson Welles and me.
Wow.
- Whatcha makin'?
- Booties. For my father.
- Gets cold in the hospital.
- Mmm.
- Has he been here long?
- This is my thirteenth pair.
-
- Excuse me.
Excuse me, Doctor.
I'm with Mr Lugosi.
How is he?
Well, there's a lot of junk in
his system for such an old man.
Apparently he was
addicted to morphine.
He tried to kick that and he got
readdicted to methadone.
- Is he gonna be okay?
- We'll do our best.
- Hi, Lillian.
- Oh, hi, Ed. He's got
a lot of visitors today.
- He does?
- Mm-hmm.
-
-  Smile. That's it!
-  Hey! Hey!
- One more picture, sir?
- Do the doctors say you're
gonna get outta here?
-  Freaks!
Get outta here!
Get outta here!
What is wrong with you people?
Come on, trash barrel!
Hey!
Bela, what happened?
Eddie, why did you
chase them?
After all these years, the press is
finally interested again in Bela Lugosi.
Bela...
those people are parasites;
they just wanna exploit you.
Fine. Let them.
There is no such thing
as bad press, Eddie.
Man firom New York even said
he's putting me on the firont page.
First celebrity ever to check
into rehab.
When I get out of here...
I will be healthy...
strong...
primed for my comeback...
Hello again.
- Hi.
- You look beat.
No, l-I'm fine.
How's your father?
Better. Thank you for asking.
And your friend?
Not good.
Well, I made him some booties
to cheer him up.
They're black,
to match his cape.
Say, have you always
lived in Los Angeles?
No, I'm from back east.
Poughkeepsie.
You know... all-American small town;
everybody knows everybody;
my dad worked for the post office;
I was a Boy Scout.
- Did you find it boring?
- No, not at all.
I had my comic books
and pulp magazines.
- Used to listen
to radio dramas constantly.
- I love those shows.
- The Shadow, Inner Sanctum.
- Yes.
- And the Mercury Theater
with Orson Welles.
- Mmm.
Boy, you know, every Saturday
afternoon me and my dad...
marched down the street in our uniform
to the little movie theatre.
Oh, the spook house!
-
- Aah!
-
- Aaaarrr!
You're not gonna believe
the first picture I ever saw.
It was your friend's...
Dracula.
- That's incredible; that's
the first picture I ever saw.
- That is incredible.
- You know, I had to sleep
with the lights on for a week.
- I had to for a month.
But I never missed a Lugosi picture
after that one.
A few years ago I actually saw him
do Dracula live.
It was much scarier
in person.
-
-  Oh. We're stuck.
Kathy...
I'm about to tell you something that
I never told any girl on a first date.
But I think it's important
that you know...
I like to wear
women's clothes.
- Huh?
- I like to wear women's clothes.
Panties, brassieres,
sweaters, pumps.
It's just
something I do.
Yes, I can't believe I'm telling
you this, but I really like you...
and I don't want it getting
in the way down the road.
Does this mean...
you don't like sex with girls?
No, I love sex
with girls.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
-
-
You see, we thought that Mr Lugosi
was insured through his union.
- Isn't he?
- No, they say his eligibility
ran out years ago.
Look, Doctor...
he doesn't have
any money.
But I'll give you everything I've got;
a few hundred dollars.
That won't even begin to cover it.
He's gonna have to leave.
Bela?
Bela, wake up.
I've got some great news.
The doctor says you're all
better;, you can go home now.
Really?
I don't feel so great.
No? Well, you look
just peachy.
And, uh, the tests
came back fiine.
Come on, let's get up.
Here we go.
Atta boy. Good.
Eddie...
I want to make
another picture.
When are we going to
make another picture?
Oh... soon, Bela.
Very soon.
This is so exciting.
Another production.
Isn't it?
So, Eddie, shouldn't we
have a sound crew?
Uh, no, no, because this
is just second unit stuff.
We're gonna do the main
footage later. All right?
So, what's
this scene about?
Um...
You're a very important
and respected man.
And you're leaving your house;
you're in a hurry.
You're on your way to
a big social brouhaha. Okay?
Eddie. What if I'm not
in so big a hurry?
What if I take a moment
to slow down;
to savour the beauty of life;
to, to smell
a budding flower?
That's great.
That is great.
Let's do a take.
Okay?
-
- Ed, I'm really busy.
- What do you want now?
- I was calling to see
if you'd like to attend...
the world premiere of my new movie,
Bride Ofi The Monster.
- Didn't you just make one
called Bride Ofi The Atom?
- Yes, it's the same film.
But the distributor
wanted a punchier title.
Come on, it's gonna be
a big event; Bela, Tor and Cris
are coming. You'll have fun!
Uhh! I can't see.
These contact lenses
are hurting.
My eyes
are killin' me.
Don't worry.
We're almost there.
Hi.
Right in there. Thank God you're here.
They're tearing up the place.
Come on, come on.
Come on, this way.
-
- Come on!
Come on!
- I've never been to
a movie premiere before!
-
Well,
go knock 'em dead.
- Oooh!
-
At the stroke
of midnight...
the witching hour...
the ghouls arise...
-
- firom the dead!
- Hey, Vampira, how 'bout a little love!
- Fuck off!
- One of them stole my wallet!
-
- I can't see!
- Get off me! Let's go!
- I gotta save 'em!
-
Get your heads down!
Come on, let's go! We're
getting the heck outta here!
-
- Can't see!
I can't see any more!
Hey, come on!
Let's split!
- Taxi!
-
- Stop!
-  Get in!
Come on! Go on, get in!
Now, that
was a premiere.
Eddie...
- last night was quite a romp.
-
- Did you see that kid
grab Vampira's boobies?
-
I envied him.
Hell, I envied you too.
A girlfriend who would jump
in front of a car like that.
Yes, she is
quite something.
None of my wives
would have.
Eddie,
I want to thank you.
These last few days
have been...
a good time.
You know, I just...
- I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
- Ahh.
No problem.
I know it by heart.
Home.
I have no home.
Hunted.
Despised.
Living like an animal.
The jungle is my home.
But I shall
show the world...
that I can be its master!
I shall perfect my own race
of people...
a race
of atomic supermen...
that will conquer the world!
Uh, Mr Lugosi, could I have
your autograph, please?
- Certainly.
- Why, that was... That was incredible.
- I mean, you're just
as great as you ever were.
- Better.
I am 7 4,
but I don't know it.
When the brain is young...
the spirit is still...
vigorous...
like...
like a young man.
"And left the planet Mars...
never to return again."
-
- The end.
- Mmm.
-
Wood Productions.
Hey, who's crazy idea was it
to bury him in the cape?
I heard it was in the will; it was how
he wanted to be remembered.
Could you run it again?
Mr Wood.
- Huh?
- Uh, Mr Wood, this is Mr Reynolds,
your landlord.
Could you please open up?
One minute.
- Yes?
- Uh, Mr Wood, you have bounced
your third and final rent cheque.
I'm terribly sorry.
My-My stockbroker must've transferred
the wrong account.
- Come on in.
I'll write you another cheque.
-
Ahh. I see you're in
the picture business.
-Yes.
-I'm interested in the picture business.
My associates and l, we wish to produce
a series of uplifting religious films...
about the apostles.
But unfortunately,
we don't have enough money.
Well, raising money's tough.
No, our church has
enough money for one film.
We just don't have enough
for all twelve.
Well, you know
what you do?
You produce a film in
a commercially-proven genre...
and then after it's a hit,
you take the profits from that
and make the 1 2 apostles movies.
- Would that work?
- Absolutely.
Let me show you
something.
You see this script?
Grave Robbers From Outer Space.
Money in the bank.
Grave robbers from what?
From outer space. It's science fiction.
Very big with the kids.
If you make this picture, you'll
have enough money to finance
a hundred religious films...
and pay my back rent
with the profits.
I don't know. This is, um,
all a lot to absorb.
It's a guaranteed blockbuster.
Mmm.
I understand this science fiction is
very popular, but, um...
don't the big hits
always have big stars?
-Well, we have a big star... Bela Lugosi.
-Bela Lugosi...
Oh, I thought
he passed on.
Yes.
Yes, he did.
But...
-I've got the last footage he ever shot.
-Doesn't look like very much.
Mr Reynolds, this is the acorn
that will grow a great oak.
I'll just get a double
to finish his scenes...
and we'll release it
as Bela Lugosi's final film.
Bunny?
We're makin' another movie.
Yes, I got the Baptist Church of
Beverly Hills to put up the cash.
-
-  Ed, I got
the Lugosi doubles outside.
Bunny, I gotta go.
He's too short.
He's too tall.
He's just not
going to work.
Well, Ed, I was thinkin' like
when Bela played Fu Manchu.
- Paul, that was Karloff.
- Oh.
- You're gonna have to try harder.
- Okay.
- Try to be a cut above. Go get 'em.
- Okay. Right.
Keep Sunday open; the producers
want us to get baptised. Okay.
You know, hon, when you rewrite a
script, it just gets better and better.
This is the ultimate Ed Wood movie.
No compromises.
Oh, my.
- Eddie, look at this.
- Hmm?
What?
Poor girl's
out of a job.
I brought the script. You'll be
portraying the ghoul's wife.
- The ghoul's wife?
- Yes.
-
- You should feel lucky.
Eddie's the only fella in town who
doesn't pass judgement on people.
That's right. If I did,
I wouldn't have any friends.
Look, would it be possible to make the
ghoul's wife a little less prominent...
- so people wouldn't really
notice me in the movie?
- You don't want to be noticed?
Yeah. How about this? What if I don't
have any lines? I'll play the part mute.
- Mute?
- Hey, it's Dr Tom.
- Dr Tom! Hiya!
- Who's Dr Tom?
- He's my chiropractor.
- Hey, Kathy. How are you?
- Fine, thanks.
- Well, look at you.
You're looking
in alignment today.
Well, actually, my neck
is a little funny.
Now, here,
let me fix that.
-
- Ooh!
My gosh!
Don't move.
It's uncanny.
Look at his head!
It's uncanny!
¢Ü Lift up your voice ¢Ü
¢Ü And let us sing ¢Ü
¢Ü Alleluia, alleluia ¢Ü
-
- He look nothin' like Bela.
He's kinda
got his ears.
Oh, look.
Cover your face with this.
Oh.
Now I can see it.
I want to suck
your blood.
I want to suck
your blood!
- Let's hear you call
Boris Karloff a cocksucker.
-
Shh!
We want these Baptists
to like us. Please.
Alleluia
Brothers and sisters...
we reach now in the service
a joyous point...
because we are going to bear witness
to the baptism of our new members.
Why couldn't we do this in the church?
Because Brother Tor couldn't fit
in the sacred tub.
Welcome to the fold,
brother.
- Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your personal saviour?
- Yes!
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.
- Amen.
-
Welcome to the fold,
brother. Welcome.
Praise the Lord,
brother.
Do you reject Satan
and all his evils?
Sure.
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.
praise the Lord, firiends!
- Do you repent fior all your sins?
-  I do.
How do you do it? How do you get
all your friends to get baptised...
-just so you can make a monster movie?
- It's not a monster movie.
- It's a supernatural thriller.
- Come to Jesus, brother!
I can't believe this.
- Ed, what am I gonna do here?
- What do you mean?
- He has no hair.
- Gee, I never noticed that.
Put a wig on him!
Before we start shooting,
Mr Wood, we have a few questions.
Yes. The script contains numerous
references to grave robbing.
Now, we find the concept of
digging up consecrated ground
to be highly offensive.
- It is blasphemy.
- What are you talking about?
It's the premise of the movie.
- It's the title of the movie,
for Christ's sakes!
- Mr Wood!
Yes, about that title.
It strikes us
as very inflammatory.
Why don't we change it to
plan 9 From Outer Space?
Ha! That's ridiculous.
All right.
And, action!
Medical examiner
been around yet?
Just left. The morgue wagon oughta
be along most any time.
- You get their statement?
- Yeah, but they're pretty scared.
Fine mess like this
will frighten anyone.
You have
one ofi the boys, uh...
take the guy and the girl back to town;
you take charge.
What'd you give him all the lines for?
He's unintelligible.
Lugosi's dead and Vampira won't talk;
I had to give somebody the dialogue!
That is no answer!
What about glitter?
When I was a headliner
in Paris, audiences always
liked it when I sparkled.
No!
- Cat's eyes!
- No!
- Well, I'm going to need some antennae.
- No!
You're the ruler of the galaxy!
Show a little taste!
See? No talking.
Isn't he good?
- Cue Dr Tom.
- N-Now?
Yes, now.
Lurk him.
Be sure and keep
your face covered.
Isn't it wonderful?
Bela lives.
Doesn't it strike you
as a bit morbid?
No. He would've loved it.
Bela's returned
from the grave.
Just like Dracula.
Cue Vampira.
-
- Cut!
Let's go down and fiind out
whose grave it is.
Oh, why do I always get hooked up
with these spook details?
Monsters, graves, bodies!
Cue flying saucer.
And cut! Print.
We're moving on.
- That was perfect.
- Perfect? Mr Wood...
do you know anything about
the art of film production?
Well, I like
to think so.
That cardboard headstone
tipped over.
This graveyard
is obviously phoney.
Nobody will ever
notice that.
Filmmaking is not about the tiny
details. It's about the big picture.
-  The big picture?
- Yes.
How about when the policemen arrived in
daylight, but now it's suddenly night?
What do you know? Haven't you
heard of suspension of disbelief?
Reverend, I'm here.
- Oh.
- Who is he?
This is our choir director.
He's gonna play
the young hero.
Are you people insane?
I'm the director!
I make the casting decisions
around here!
I thought this was
a group effort.
No!
No?
They're driving me crazy!
These Baptists are...
stupid, stupid, stupid!
Okay.
I gotta calm down.
Gotta calm down.
Gotta calm down.
Take a deep breath.
Relax.
All right, everybody.
Let's get set up for scene 1 1 2.
Move the crypt stage left, and let's
get Tor's make-up effect ready.
Mr Wood!
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm directing.
Not like that
you're not!
Remove that get-up
immediately!
You shame our Lord.
That's it!
I can't take it!
Take me to the nearest bar,
and make it snappy!
Imperial Whisky.
Oh, my gosh.
Orson Welles.
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yes?
Um... Well, I'm a young filmmaker
and a real big fan.
l... I just wanted
to meet you.
My pleasure.
I'm Orson Welles.
I'm, uh,
Edward D. Wood,Jr.
What you working on?
Well, the financing just fell through
for the third time on Don Quixote.
You know,
I can't believe it.
That sounds just exactly
like my problems.
It's the damn money men.
They never know who's a windbag
and who's got the goods.
Then they all think
they're directors.
Ain't that the truth?
Do you know that I've even
had producers re-cut my movies?
- I hate when that happens.
- And they're always trying
to cast their buddies.
It doesn't even matter if
they're right for the part.
Tell me about it. I'm supposed
to do a thriller at Universal...
but they want Charlton Heston
to play a Mexican.
Ah, Mr Welles.
Is it all worth it?
It is when it works.
You know, the one film of mine
where I had total control, Kane?
The studio hated it...
but they didn't
get to touch a firame.
- Ed.
- Yes?
Visions are worth
fiighting fior.
Why spend your lifie
making someone else's dreams?
Thank you... Orson.
- Mr Reynolds.
- Yes.
We are gonna finish this picture
just the way I want it...
because you cannot compromise
an artist's vision.
- But it's our money.
- And you're gonna make a bundle...
but only if you shut up
and let me do things my way.
All right, gang. Actors in positions.
Let's finish this picture.
Action.
Wanna give him a hand?
Keep rolling.
Now that's an alien.
Action.
- What plan will you follow now?
- Plan 9.
Plan 9?
Ah, yes.
Plan 9 deals with
the resurrection of the dead.
Long-distance electrodes shot into
the pineal and pituitary glands...
of the recent dead.
You know, maybe you guys were right.
"Plan 9" is a good title.
I want that lightning,
I want those two explosions...
- and I've got to have
more shots of the military!
- Right.
And cut.
All right, friends.
Prepare for scene 32.
- M-Mr. Wood?
- Yeah?
- Where's the cockpit set?
- You're standing in it. Places!
But what if we develop
this solenite bomb?
Then we'd be
a stronger nation too.
"Stronger."
You see?
You see?
Your stupid minds.
Stupid.
Stupid!
- That's all I'm gonna take outta you!
- Oh!
Cut!
Action.
Greetings, my friend.
We are all interested
in the future...
for that is where you and I are going
to spend the rest of our lives.
And remember, my friend:
Future events such as these
will effect you in the future.
And... cut!
That's a wrap.
Oh!
I can't get it up.
It's stuck.
Eddie, you're gonna be late
for your own premiere.
All right,
forget it.
-
- Ladies and gentlemen.
You are about to see
an extraordinary motion picture.
But befiore it begins, I think we
should all give a hand to the man...
without whom we wouldn't
be here tonight.
Eddie, take a bow!
Thank you.
I just wanna say
that this film...
is for Bela.
The griefi ofi his wifie's death...
became greater
and greater agony.
The home they had
so long shared together...
became a tomb...
a sweet memory
ofi herjoyous living.
The sky to which
he had once looked...
was now only a covering
fior her dead body.
The ever-beautifiul flowers
she had planted...
with her own hands...
became nothing more than
the lost roses ofi her cheeks.
Confiused by
his great loss...
the old man
left that home...
never to return again.
This is the one.
This is the one
I'll be remembered for.
Aw, gee, honey,
I'm so happy for ya!
Say, let's get married.
- Huh?
- Right now. Let's go to Vegas.
But, Eddie, it's pouring,
and the car top is stuck.
Phooey! It's only
a five-hour drive...
and it'll probably stop
by the time we get to the desert.
Heck, it'll probably stop by the time
we get around the corner. Let's go.
Oh!
