Come out, come out,
wherever you are!
Where is that little joker?
Breathe deep, Mrs. Dunne.
That's it. That's it.
Push.
Push, that's it.
Keep pushing,
you're doing great, Mrs. Dunne.
You're doing great.
Okay, that's it.
There's the head,
I can see it now.
Okay, congratulations...
It's a...
Okay, it went back in.
I think he'll be good
at hide and seek, Mrs. Dunne.
Okay.
Well, you got yourself
a shy one here.
Okay, come on out,
you Iittle bastard.
Ow!
He bit me!
Attention all units,
man trapped in a well.
Captain Rob!
Captain Rob, can you hear me?
Grab the rope!
Can you help him?
Harry, no. This is--
this is not a real well.
We can't keep coming out here
trying to get
your imaginary
friend out of trouble.
Well, thanks for saving him.
Coming, Captain Rob!
We didn't really
save anybody.
I'm sorry, Dave.
It's okay, he just has
an overactive imagination.
Don't worry, he'II grow out of it.
They all do.
Captain Rob, come on out,
I give up!
Where is he?
Where are you, Captain Rob?
Honey, he's gone.
He must've known you were
starting school today.
Mom, do I have
to go to regular school?
- Yes, honey.
- But you're a good teacher.
Thank you, sweetie. I think it's time
you made some new friends.
You know, friends
your own age.
- I'm just not ready.
- Oh, I almost forgot.
Captain Rob
Ieft this for you.
He said to count your steps
very carefully.
Wow, a treasure map!
- What's the treasure?
- It could be anything.
Honey, you're going to discover a whole
new world when you get to school.
Like Marco Polo.
The guy who invented
the swimming pool.
Of course.
- I better get going.
- Now remember, Harry,
there's a friend out there
waiting just for you.
You're a good kid, Lloyd.
And good looking, too.
You make a father proud.
- Thanks, Pop.
- Okay, now Iet me finish--
Dad, watch the ears.
Aah. Okay,
there you go, gigolo.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Looks good?
- Like fresh-cut grass.
Okay, now come on.
Let's get ready,
school's going to open real soon now.
Let's go.
- Oh, keys please.
- Here you go.
It's good to be
a janitor's son.
- Love ya!
- Love you.

Oh, Iook at this.
Okay ready?
Smile for papa. Come on.
Ready?
Yee-aah!
Okay, wait, wait, wait!
Okay, if you're gonna
go to school you need a book.
Okay? Okay, ready?
Okay, okay.
Look pretty.
Pretty, pretty.
Pretty... boy!
I got to catch my bus.
See you, Pop!
Yeah, but you're already
at school!
Hope they Iike my new jacket!
We go through this every year.
Got to get to school.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Hi. Hi.
- Sorry.
- You're going the wrong way, Ioser!
Can't miss my bus.
Okay, so follow the map
and find a friend.
So what's the apple for?
This is too distracting.
One of you has to go.
I'm sorry it's you.
Now...
take your seeds
and grow into a beautiful pie.
Hey, whoa!
- Sorry about that, mate.
- Nice car, Frenchie.
Hey, cute puppy.
Aww.
Rarr!
Whoa, whoa!
Bad dog! Don't get me,
don't get me!
Aaah!
Bad doggie! Bad doggie!
Whoa, whoa!
No, no, no!
Oooh!
Somebody chipped my tooth.
How do you think I feel?
Someone bit me
in the forehead.
Oh, no!
You could've saved that
for the tooth fairy.
That's stupid. I happen to know
my mom is the tooth fairy.
- Your mom is the tooth fairy?
- Yeah.
Wow, that is so cool.
She must do all the flying
around when I'm asleep.
Yeah, yeah.
- Harry Dunne.
- Harry Dunne?
Why does that not
sound familiar?
- Probably because we've never met?
- No, that's not it.
Anyway, yeah,
LIoyd Christmas.
Here I am bragging
my mom's the tooth fairy
- and you're Santa's kid?!
- No, no.
- Yeah!
- Yeah? No, I'm not.
- I knew it!
- No, I'm not.
- I bet you are.
- No, I bet I'm not.
- I know you are.
- Why have I never seen you here before?
Home school,
till today.
Home school.
What's that?
I go to school
where I Iive.
Me too!
Seriously!
- No?
- Yeah!
Whoa, that's my bus! Hey! Hey!
No, wait!
No, wait!
Hi! Hello!
I missed it.
Now I have to walk.
It's right over there.
- Is that what I think it is?
- Nope, it's a treasure map.
Cool.
My mom says it's
somewhere in the school.
I don't know, I'm pretty
familiar with the school
and I've never seen
that X before. Mm-mmm.
Ooh, but I do
know something.
- What?
- Yeah.
You're it.
I'm it?
What's it?
I don't really know,
you know, but whatever it is,
it's something you
don't want to be, and right now...
yeah, you are.
Wait, so if I touch you,
you're it?
- Yeah, that's how it works, Harry.
- You're it!
- No, Harry!
- See you Iater!
Wait-- ahh!
Hello, my yellow friend.
Sorry I missed ya.
So high school's all about Iooking cool,
Harry, so stick with me.
Why are those girls
dressed in matching outfits?
They're cheerleaders, Harry.
It's a dangerous cult.
- Don't let them talk to you.
- Don't we want them to talk to us?
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
- Why not?
Besides cooties and other
medical reasons,
they're not in the cool crowd, which
I am, which you want to be a part of.
- You know what I mean?
- No. Hey.
- What about her?
- She's a total dork.
I mean, just Iook
how she dresses.
Check out that skirt. I mean,
it's so short. Where's the flood?
And that sweater-- it's so tight,
her milk-bubbles are popping out.
Loser.
Oh my gosh, she's not
wearing underwear.
Yeah, how dorky is that.
I'm wearing two pair right now.
Me too.
This is my Mohawk friend, Turk.
He's part of the cool crowd.
Hey, Kimosabe!
Shut up, ass-face.
That's the Iroquois name he gave me
for having the strong face of an ass.
Looks Iike we're going
to go have a pow-wow!
Ooh. Hi.
I hope the carpet
matches the drapes.
Excuse me?
You know, in the Iibrary.
Oh. Yeah.
I don't think it does.
- You're new here, right?
- Depends on how you define new.
You're the kid
who was home schooled.
Yeah.
How'd you know?
I was assigned to write
an article for the school paper.
It was either
a feature on you
or the new four-color ink pens
at the student store.
Four colors in one pen?
No! That's impossible.
Yeah, well,
I'd rather be writing a hard-hitting
investigative piece
but nothing ever happens around here.
I'm Jessica Matthews.
Hi.
- Harry Dunne.
- What's going on here?
Hey, freakshow,
did Jessica give you
that banana in your pants?
No, my mom did.
- Gross.
- You want a bite?
Hey, smells Iike cheese. Whoo!
- Turk, Ieave him alone.
- "Turk, Ieave him alone."
- Shut up!
- "Shut up!"
- Oh boy.
- Harry, I'II talk to you Iater.
Pretty colors.
Ride's not over yet, pal.
Hey, can my friend
Harry come too?
- Yes, he can.
- Hi, Harry.
So were you held back
two years Iike LIoyd?
No, I was held back three.
By your mom?
กำ All you got
to feel it, all right. กำ
And Principal Collins,
you'll be pleased to know
that this year
Wednesday's are
"South of the Border" days.
We'II be serving
a spicy tuna tamale
along with a three-cheese
quesadilla.
Sounds Iike it's going
to be another...
hot year in the kitchen.
- Hello?
- Yes? What is it?
Sir, it's time
for morning announcements.
Yes, I--
I'm aware of that.
Yes. Um...
why don't you make
the announcements this morning, dear?
But what should I announce?
- Tell her about the quesadillas.
- Make something up!
Okay.
Well, that was
a mood breaker.
You know, honey...
I think I've finally
figured out a way
to bilk this school
out of enough money
to get us that condo
in Waikiki.
How, sweet baby?
You've done it all.
Small potatoes.
This is the big one.
This is visionary.
This idea is genius.
Look at this.
The Richard Moffitt
Special Needs Grant.
This Moffitt guy used to be
in a special needs program,
and then he Iearns to string
a couple of sentences together
and now he's some
big hotshot.
Anyway, the state is giving
to every school that has
a special needs class.
- This is fantastic!
- Mm-hmm.
AII we have to do
is kill this Moffitt guy
and we get all the money.
No, no.
What we need is to set up
a fake special needs class.
We start our own class.
Problem is,
where do we find kids...
we can pass off
as special?
Okay, that's high enough!
- Thanks, Turk.
- I'm flying! Woo-hoo!
So this is what a flag
sees all day.
- Yeah.
- And your friend Turk is totally great.
Yeah, he's aces, huh?
Hey, thanks, Turk!
We're so high!
Bingo.
Welcome to special needs
orientation.
I'm Ms. Heller,
the Iunch Iady.
And it--
damn.
I mean, your new teacher.
Yeah.
Now the reason you two are here
before class officially starts
is because you're...
extra special.
Thank you.
And were personally selected
by Principal Collins.
Who's Principal Collins?
- He's the principal.
- Wow.
Your first assignment
is to pick
the rest of the class.
Hey!
Find students that are
just as special as you two.
Special.
What?
Is-- is this gonna be
on the midterm?
No.
You know, you're the first person
I ever brought here, Harry.
- Is this your special place?
- No, I just usually eat in the crapper.
Yeah, saves time.
Out with the old, in with the new.
- Could we eat there tomorrow?
- Yeah, but first we need to find kids
that are special, needy, and classy enough
to be in our special needs class.
It'II be Iike taking
candy from a stranger.
- "Har-ery"?
- The second "R" is silent.
Oh, that makes
much more sense.
Oh, Iittle crippled boy.
Look.
Our first recruit.
- His curse is our blessing.
- Careful, Harry, don't scare him.
Hey, Iittle guy.
Hey Iittle orphan buddy.
- What happened?
- Skateboard.
- One day, they'II find a cure.
- You brave Iittle soldier.
What?
No, man, it's nothing.
The cast comes off in a few weeks.
He's obviously in denial.
Maybe we can help.
We're part of a special class
taught by the Iunch Iady.
I mean, Ms. Heller.
You should join up.
It doesn't
require any walking.
No one will make fun
of your horrible deformity.
- How much homework is there?
- That's the downside.
- There's none.
- Dude, dude.
Wait a minute, I can spend
the whole year
in a class taught
by the Iunch Iady?
Yeah.
- Can I bring my girlfriend?
- You can bring whatever you want.
AII right.
กำ Yeah กำ
กำ Here we go กำ
กำ It's a new day,
but it all feels old กำ
- กำ It's a good life
that's what I'm told กำ
กำ But everyday,
it all just feels the same กำ
กำ At my high school,
it felt more to me กำ
กำ Like a jail cell,
a penitentiary... กำ
- Harry Dunne, Special Needs.
- He's with us.
You deserve him.
- I guess I owe you this one.
- กำ I don't ever want to be like you กำ
กำ I don't want to do
the things you do กำ
กำ I'm never gonna hear
the words you say กำ
กำ And I don't ever wanna,
I don't ever wanna กำ
กำ Be you กำ
กำ Don't wanna
be just like you... กำ
Go, go, go!
กำ This is the anthem,
throw all your hands up กำ
กำ You... กำ
He's out.
Put him on the disabled Iist.
That means you're
one of us now.
กำ You... กำ
We already have
a special slogan.
Harry,
what are you doing?
She's a foreign
exchange student.
She obviously doesn't
speak the English.
Ching chong ching
chingy chong ching chong ching.
กำ You กำ
กำ Don't want to be just like you กำ
กำ What I'm saying is
this is the anthem กำ
- กำ Throw all your hands up กำ
- Ching chongen ay.
กำ Y'all got to feel me,
sing if you're with me... กำ
Get your car washed
and support the Stallions.
- Aah.
- Whoa!
The half boy/half horse.
Oh! That's more
of what we're Iooking for.
- He's super special.
- Well...
I mean, I got to get
a job anyway.
So if I--
if I sign your thing,
I can just come and go
whenever I want to?
You were born free,
and free
you shall remain.
Well, okay.
Ah!
Easy, easy.
Easy, boy, easy, boy.
Easy, boy. It's okay.
You're in!
- We did it!
- Yes, we did, Harry.
Special needs class, 1986.
We are the chosen ones,
all present and accounted for.
... football player,
the crippled kid...
What about Lewis,
the half horse boy?
- He really had me fooled.
- Here we go.
Hey, thanks
for the grub, Mrs. D.
- You're welcome, LIoyd.
- Hey, where's Mr. D?
Oh, he passed away
a few years ago.
He missed
one great pot of stew.
Actually, it's meatloaf, but you just
put everything in your soup.
I Iike it a Iot.
Harry, I am so proud of you
making a real friend.
Is it okay
if he spends the night?
- LIoyd, have you asked your parents?
- I Ieft my dad a note.
"Pop, I'm sleeping
at Harry's tonight.
Love, LIoyd.
P.S., you're out of ketchup."
Good kid,
but you could've just called.
Got any crazy eights?
Go fish.
Nothing.
Four.
Ha! Now you have to move
your peg seven spaces
and put your shirt
on backwards.
Wow, you really suck
at this game.
Yeah, well, I almost always
beat Captain Rob.
- Who's Captain Rob?
- Just a guy I hang out with.
I know the type. Lives in the basement,
smells Iike a sponge.
No, Captain Rob's seven feet tall,
wears an eye-patch,
- got a hook for a hand.
- Wow, sounds Iike a pirate.
What? No. He's got a parrot on his
shoulder, buries treasure.
- Yeah, that's a pirate.
- I don't think so.
This guy drinks rum from a barrel,
says, "Yo, ho, ho," has a peg Ieg.
- A peg Ieg?
- Yeah, go-cart accident.
Here... we... go!
Be careful, Captain Rob.
- Ooh.
- Three, two, one.
Aah, you Ianded on Candy Land.
Now you have to swallow it.
Ready?
Swallow!
That's good top hat.
Hey, fellas,
it's getting kind of Iate.
Come on.
- Can I be on top?
- Only if I can be on bottom.
- AII right!
- Yeah!
Airplane into the hangar.
Zzz-- ow!
AII right, pumpkin,
night night.
'Night, Mom.
- 'Night Mrs. D.
- Good night, LIoyd.
Thanks for being
a friend to my Harry.
All right, boys, sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
- กำ Hey, hey... กำ
- Ohh. Huh!
- What was that?
- What?
Your mom just totally
made a move on me.
- She did not.
- Yeah, she did, Harry.
Maybe soon
I'II be your new daddy.
- LIoyd, she's my mom.
- Listen, I can't help my heart.
That's right, when I'm your new dad,
you're gonna have to do what I say.
Will not.
Don't you take that tone
with me, young man.
- Shut up.
- I will stop this car right now.
- You're not my real dad.
- You take that back!
- Be quiet, buttlick!
- Ohh!
- Where did you Iearn that word?
- I Iearned it from...
Iistening to you!
- I hate you!
- Kids.
Thank you, Principal Collins...
For our specially needy class!
- They're perfect.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, you should all
be very proud of yourselves.
You are the pioneers here
at Providence Hill High,
the very first
special needs class.
And to commemorate
this occasion,
we're going to take
a class photo.
So Iet's cover this up
just for the picture.
Hold this very high.
That's it.
And Iet's all form a group
under the sign. Quickly.
Now, now,
now, now, now.
Beautiful.
Big smile.
Here we go.
Do you remember why
we're here?
I'm supposed to take a picture
for Superintendent Zimmer?
And?
- You want me to take it?
- Yes, yes!
- Oh.
- Okay.
Okay, here we go.
Ready?
Cheese!
- Cheese.
- Cheese!
- What stinks?
- That'd be me, sir.
- Wife made the stew Iast night.
- Shut up, LIoyd.
- You're not married yet.
- Will be.
I hope you'II all enjoy
your new classroom.
This is not it. It's a special wing
in back of the school we've built for you.
Why don't you go back
and take a Iook at it now?
Quickly, now.
Just head back there. That's it, now.
Principal Collins,
what about the crippled boy?
- Yes, take him with you.
- "Confirmitive."
Easy. LIoyd, LIoyd, LIoyd.
No, no, no.
I can-- I'II just walk,
all right? Is that all right?
Collins is a great man.
Yeah, that's why he was
elected principal.
- That's it. On your way.
- Your Highness.
That's good.
Well, so far so good.
I do think we need
some more pictures, though.
Why don't you take the kids
on a field trip tomorrow?
And...?
- And take some more pictures.
- Okay.
Yeah, okay.
Well, don't you have
a phony class to teach?
I put in for a sub.
Was that naughty?
I think I need a "panking."
Pank, pank, pank.
You gonna give me
a panking?
กำ Clap your hands... กำ
Hello, class.
My name is Mr. Christmas.
Mrs. Heller had to attend
some serious and urgent business,
so I will be
your substitute teacher.
It's gonna take me a while to Iearn
everyone's names, so please be patient.
- Me, me. Pick me!
- Uh... you.
- Harry.
- Harry. Oooh.
You Iook familiar.
Oh, did I have your brother?
- No.
- No, okay. Any other questions?
- Was there one...?
- Yo!
What's with horse boy?
Now he's a bright shiny sun.
Yeah, don't Iook
directly at him.
I'm just handing out fliers
at the tanning salon, guys.
- It's a part-time job.
- No, that's-- congratulations.
Did you have a question there,
bright eyes?
Yeah, my question's when
the old teacher Iady coming back?
I am your teacher Iady for today.
LIoyd, can I have
a word with you for a minute?
Oh, take this time
to study amongst yourselves.
Obviously there must be some
sort of family emergency,
otherwise there's no reason
my father would be
interrupting me
while I'm working.
- Coming. What the...?
- That's your dad?
Yeah.
What was your name again?
- Harry.
- Harry. Come with me, Harry.
- What's up, Pop?
- We need to talk.
So you must be in the air force.
I Iike your flight suit.
- I'm a custodian.
- Well, then...
aye aye, sir!
Okay, what are you crazy boys
doing in my tool shed?
We're not crazy, Dad,
we're special.
And Principal Collins wants us
to have our own special classroom.
My boy's special,
how 'bout that?!
I knew you
were different! Ohhh!
I'm taking the day off.
Come on, come on.
AII right, guys,
now that teacher Iady's gone,
um... I have a question.
Do you guys know why
our class is in the tool shed?
Who cares, Lewis?
It's better than real school.
If we don't mess this up,
we can go a whole year without
doing any real work at all.
Yeah, man, we can do
anything we want.
Anything.
Anything?
So if I had a girlfriend Iike Terri,
I could bring her here and...
do stuff with her?
You got it, jerk-off.
Then I'm in.
Yeah.
But I came here to Iearn
about America.
Listen, baby,
there is nothing more American
than not doing anything
and getting away with it.
Ohh.
Then I'm in.
- Just Iike jerk-off.
- Lewis.
Carl?
- He's snapping out of it.
- We need him.
I know.
Come on, kid!
- Come on, come on!
- Go get some!
Carl?
Oh, wow.
Who is Benjamin Franklin again?
He's the pilgrim who used
penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Right.
How'd you get so smart?
Public school.
Yeah.
When you Iive in the basement,
you breathe in a Iot of chalk dust.
It writes all the answers
all over your brain.
- You're so Iucky.
- Ooh, now...
- How 'bout a SIushee?
- A. SIushee.
Don't tell me.
Abraham SIushee--
I know this-- third President
of the United States!
That's right, Harry.
And this is the frozen delicious treat
he was named after.
- Nice jugs.
- Yeah.
Hey, your mom's
got jugs Iike these.
Yeah, but they
never been in a magazine.
They ought to be.
They're beautiful.
Ooh, Harry,
I just realized something.
- What?
- You're it!
- Oh no, you're not getting me again.
- "Victoria's Secret," huh?
- Those clothes are for chicks.
- $2.50.
- You're it.
- Oh, you wanna go?
You wanna go,
huh, Harry?
Jousting,
- You're it!
- You're it.
Invisibility shield.
Booo!
I know where you are!
- I know where you are!
- PIease pay me the $2.50.
I know where you are!
- I know where you are!
- You're it.
Seriously, stop for a second.
Come here, Harry,
seriously, for a second. You're it!
Oh!
No, you're it!
Harry, buns!
You're it!
You're it!
- You're it!
- No, I'm not.
Yeah, you are.
He touched you.
You're it until
you touch someone else.
I know the rules, I'm just not
playing your stupid game.
Now pay me $2.50.
You're it.
You're it.
- You're it.
- No, you're it.
- No, you are.
- You're it.
You're it.
Enough!
You're it!
And no touch-backs,
no do-overs,
no erasies,
and in this whole store
is home free!
LIoyd, can he do that?
Oh yeah, Harry.
He can...
and he did.
And now...
it's on
Iike Donkey Kong.
Pay the man.
Pay the man.
- Good.
- Yeah.
I thought we
handled that pretty well.
These are really cold, huh?
That's why you got
to drink 'em fast, Harry, trust me.
Drink it, Harry.
Come on, buddy!
Drink, drink, drink!
Go, Harry, go!
Whoo-hoo!
Oww.
Refreshing.
Ohh! So what do you
want to do today, Harry?
I don't know.
Oww!
It hurts so good.
Ahh!
No, Harry, you're not
drinking it fast enough.
You got to drink faster.
You got to go fast. Go fast!
Go fast, go fast, go fast!
You got to drink it fast, Harry,
before it melts!
Tastes so good.
I can't feel my face.
Didn't hurt.
Didn't hurt.
I felt that.
Mmmm...
Harry, my mouth is frozen.
I can't--
I can't feel my Iips.
- Harry, they're frozen.
- I don't feel good.
Oh, Harry,
here comes trouble.
Oh, hey guys.
Your milk bubbles Iook nice,
Jessica.
Good one, Harry.
I'II see you guys tomorrow.
I can't believe she's
wearing that outfit.
Yeah, Iast time
I wore those shorts, I got beat up.
Beat up?
Guess what's
under these coconuts?
What?
It's a surprise.
Well, I've got
a Iittle surprise for you.
You got the extender?
No.
No, I talked to Superintendent
Zimmer this morning.
- Oh.
- He's sending Richard Moffitt himself
to our Thanksgiving Day parade,
check in hand.
Oh, monkey,
this is too exciting.
Our dream is coming true.
Smile, sweetheart.
More pictures
for the chest.
What do you keep
in there?
Oh, things.
Photos, tapes.
I tape everything
that goes on in this office.
Just Iike the President.
Just Iike
the President.
Come here, monkey.
- Whoo.
- Hey, it's upside down.
Here, hold my sack.
AII right, according
to the map,
we're almost at school.
Yeah, but we still
haven't found any treasure.
Harry...
กำ Hallelujah,
hallelujah... กำ
We may have found
something even better.
Come on.
It's our own
special bus, Harry!
How do you know
it's for us?
Because cool kids always sit
in the back of the bus, Harry,
and here, every row
is the back.
We're all cool.
Come on!
Careful, Harry, it's short!
Hey, Harry, I'm in the front
of the bus!
- I'm in the back!
- I'm in the front!
Turk, what are you
doing here?
- Special needs class.
- Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
You're just jealous.
This is the best class ever.
So don't ruin it!
Sorry, special needs only.
Look, Ms. Heller,
there's something fishy here.
And I don't think
it's Friday's special.
Hmm. Well,
I wouldn't know,
since I'm just
the teacher and all.
Now less talking
and more sitting, huh, gang?
Let's go, Margie,
the museum ain't gonna teach itself.
This is a much bigger story
than four-color pens.
กำ Every day I get in the queue กำ
- กำ Too much, magic bus กำ
- กำ To get on the bus that takes me to you กำ
- กำ Too much, magic bus... กำ
- You want a scoop?
I'II give you a scoop.
You think we're gonna stop for ice cream?
No. Maybe.
- กำ Your house is only another mile... กำ
- Lose her.
กำ Too much, magic bus... กำ
- SIug bug. SIug bug.
- Ow! Ow!
Can it be the same one?
SIug bug!
- Ow!
- SIug-- I can still see you.
- That's not how you play!
- Playing Australian rules.
Don't Iet her pass!
กำ I don't care
how much I pay กำ
กำ Too much, magic bus... กำ
- Scissors, scissors.
- This is too.
- What's that?
- It's an eagle.
- This is a barracuda.
- Fish can't eat a bird.
Ha, ha, too big to make the turn!
- You can't squish a bird with a paper cut.
- Yeah, you can.
- Yeah, you can.
- You can't squish-- No, you can't.
- Punch buggy.
- Ow!
Margie, Iook out!

Everyone find a partner.
You're no good to me dead.
- Harry, get back here!
- I'm back, I'm back.
- I'm going.
- Harry? Harry!
Spin faster,
we'II go back in time!
I'm right behind you.
I'm right behind you.
No, no, no!
Aaah!
We got to partner up.
- What do you say, you and me?
- Dream on, desperado.
Right, field trip partner
is kind of a big commitment.
I'm joking. Of course I'II
be your partner.
You got some serious self-worth issues,
my pudgy, ugly Iittle friend.
Stop it, you're
embarrassing me.
Okay, say "fajitas."
- Fajitas!
- Good, got it.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Now-- excuse me. How Iong does the
average field trip take here?
Well, to fully experience all we
have to offer, it takes two hours.
Two. Okay.
You know, I'II be back in four.
So why don't you give the tour twice,
and speak slowly?
- Oh, we don't take tips here.
- Oh, sure you do.
I know you don't make much.
Don't be proud.
Don't be proud. It's going away.
It's going away.
It's going away. It's okay.
That's what I thought.
- That's what I thought.
- Okay.
I like your outfit,
Mr. Polar bear.
Hmm. Okay, I'm just
going to turn and walk away.
Ha!
Okay...
I'm watching you.
Harry?
Who told you my name?
Harry?
Harry?
Ms. Heller said
not to talk to you.
That's because Ms. Heller
doesn't want you to know
this whole thing is a scam.
I knew it was a fake.
- You did?
- Yeah. Those Eskimos?
I'm sure at Ieast
one of them is a mannequin.
Harry, you're so funny.
But Iisten, I have to ask you
a question that might...
put you in
a delicate position.
You want to talk
about your delicates?
Are you trying to be funny,
or you actually re--
special?
We're all special. Everyone LIoyd
and I chose for the class is special.
You and LIoyd chose
the class?
Mm-hmm.
This is all starting
to make sense.
Could you come
to my house tonight?
- Excuse me?
- We need to talk.
- Come over around 7:00?
- O'clock?
Yeah.
Okay.
A date.
She said something
about something.
That's perfect, Harry.
Then what?
Then she said "7:00"
and I said, "O'clock!"
Sorry about that, buddy. It's my
first time bringing a friend up there.
- You okay?
- Yeah!
So you gotta
help me out, LIoyd.
A real Iive date
with a real Iive girl.
Who cares?
Chicks are for fags.
I think she wants me to come over
to put me in the right position
to check out
her delicates.
- Whatever that means.
- Oh yeah, you're gonna get some.
- Some what?
- You know.
She'II be all over you
Iike a barrelful of monkeys
with that short skirt
and that tight shirt.
Ooh, it's so faggy I can't
even think about it.
- Come on, LIoyd.
- Okay, if you're gonna do this,
bring her something special.
Buy her some chocolate--
the best you can find.
Seems simple enough.
Knock, knock, knock.
Hello, Jessica.
It's nice to see you,
Jessica.
That's not right.
Hi, Jessica.
Do you remember me from before?
I'm Harry
That's stupid!
Okay.
Hello, Jessica.
Harry-- Mrs. Harry Jessica.
Mr. Harry Jessica.
- J-e-s-s-i-s-s-i--
- Harry?
Harry, hi.
Do you want
to come inside?
Okay. Wipe your feet.
My parents are totally anal.
Oh, that's gross.
- Would you Iike something to drink?
- Yeah, but I'm buying.
Harry, I have a Iot of questions
to go over with you,
so Iet's just
go upstairs.
Good plan.
I'm not really ready for downstairs.
Harry, you're so funny.
Really?
I'm not even trying.
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.
I'II race ya!
- Harry, stop horsing around.
- Oh, boy.
Okay, there's a Iot
to go over, Harry,
so it may get
hard for you.
Hard for me?
Hard for me?
Hard for me?
Harry, do you want
to sit down?
- No, no, I'm okay.
- Okay.
I think Collins and Heller are
embezzling money from the school,
and I think it's
been going on for years.
I just have to figure out
some way to prove it.
I mean, it doesn't make
any sense to me.
But I guess there's got
to be a good explanation.
Heller wore
a coconut bra...
Wow, she's really
making me feel hot.
What's worse is I think the entire
special needs class is a scam.
But... I need proof.
I don't know how much longer
I can stand it.
I didn't think the first time
would hurt so much.
- Especially in the ass!
- What?!
Harry, I'm in a position
where I really need your help.
P-position?
Great.
Have you a bathroom?
Yeah, down the hall.
I'II be back in a jiff.
Okay, okay. Water!
Oh, I couldn't.
I didn't.
No, no, no, no.
Oh, what's in there?
Mmm.
No, it can't be.
Ohh.
Oh! No.
Oh, I didn't--
Oh, no, no, no!
Oh no, no, no...
Harry? You've been
in there a while.
- Are you okay?
- Are you kiddin'?
I couldn't be more okay.
My mom wants to know
if you can stay for dinner.
Are you kiddin'?
Coming.
Okay.
กำ I was walking down the street

กำ Hey, hey... กำ
Harry, are you coming down?
Just cleaning up!
Harry! Harry!
LIoyd, what are you doing here?
I came to check on you, buddy.
I kinda screwed things up.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
I don't think so.
Harry, why are you
covered in poo?
I-- I don't know!
- Okay.
- She asked me to stay for dinner.
I don't know
what to say to her.
Oh, okay, I got an idea!
I saw this in a movie once.
It was a good one.
Go down to this window right here,
open it up, and then
say whatever I say.
Okay, thanks.
I got to find some clothes.
AII right.
Perfect,
a businessman's suit.
Harry, what are
you wearing?
I changed for dinner.
I get dressed for all my meals,
except for breakfast and...
spazz meal.
Boy, it's hot in here.
Do you mind if I open a window?
Be my guest.
- Harry, can you hear me?
- Yes.
- Yes what?
- No, don't answer me, say what I say.
Okay.
- Okay what?
- You have beautiful eyes.
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Thank you.
Oh, hey.
- Where'd you come from?
- Hey, where'd you come from?
I was born in St. Louis.
Do you want me
to pet your head?
Do you want me
to pet your head?
- I bet you want your head scratched!
- I bet you want
- your head scratched.
- No, why?
We still have a Iot
to talk about.
I bet you want--
don't you snap at me!
You're Iucky
I don't punch you right in the face!
Don't snap at me Iike that. You're Iucky
I don't punch you in the face.
I remember you. How could I forget
those big, hairy nipples?
I remember you. How could I forget

Now what are you staring at,

Now what are you staring at,
you ugly monkey?
- Jessica, who's this?
- It's Harry, Dad.
- Why is he talking to you Iike that?
- He's... special.
Oh.
Hi, Harry.
Hi.
Bark, bark!
Dinner's ready.
What are we doing
sitting around yapping?
- Let's eat!
- Right.
Hey, Harry, be confident!
You Iook Iovely!
Oh! Yaa!
LIoyd?
What are you doing here?
You Iive here? I didn't--
I thought Harry was just...
visiting his accountant.
So you Iike
your butter, do you?
We got some margarine, if you want.
- You could scoop it out of the tub.
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- Oh!
- This is... Harry.
- Hello.
- Hi.
You know, they make that
in a woman's suit, too.
Jessica, we're eating!
Meet me at the front door.
Yeah, I was just
gonna go there anyway.
Well, I see you Iike
my rolls.
Sure, I Iike a woman
with some meat on her bones.
Well...
So Charlie,
what business are you in?
The name's Walter.
- LIoyd, hi.
- Jessica, yeah.
So, did you
give him some yet?
- Some what?
- You know, some.
LIoyd, Harry and I
have been talking about school.
In fact, I want to ask
you something.
Yeah, I know.
You want to go for a ride.
Pretty sweet waxer, huh?
- Where did that come from?
- I Iive with the janitor.
Yup, I got a key
to every room in the school.
So can you get us
into the principal's office?
Principal's office?
Yeah, I could probably swing that.
LIoyd, that's it!
Maybe now I'II get my story!
- What?!
- Aah!
Two-timing slut! And you,
I thought you were from St. Louis?
I don't ever want
to see you again!
Oh my God.
And I'm Ieaving!
He shit everywhere.
There's shit everywhere!
Damn it!
There's shit

Oh my God,

He shit everywhere!
Look what he did.
He shit all over the wall!
- When can we do it?
- Get up here!
Uh...

- Okay.
- Great, thanks.
- My house if full of bile!
Thank you, LIoyd. I got to go upstairs.
You got to Ieave.
See you at 8:00.
- Calm down, just calm down!
- Whoo-hoo!

Yeah!

I'm right on time.
Won't be Iong now.
This is gonna be great.
I can picture it now.
กำ Lloyd, Lloyd กำ
กำ Super cool Lloyd... กำ
Oh, Iadies, and that's why
God created women with two breasts
instead of three.
AIthough you're cute, too.
Yes, you are.
You should see her asses.
LIoyd, I finished
all your homework.
Oh, thanks, Jessica.
Get Iost, sister,
he's mine.
In your dreams.
I saw him first!
Oh! You just want him
for his hot rack!
You just want him because he's a genius,
Iike AIbert Frankenstein.
Girls, girls,
girls, girls!
AII right, there's only
one way to solve this.
Make out contest.
How was that, LIoyd?
LIoyd, what are you doing?
That's Jessica.
- And my mom?
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, Mom.
- Harry, this is my fantasy,
and I suggest you Ieave right now,
before I imagine something horrible.
- But, I--
- Harry!
Your fantasies are
so much cooler than mine.
Hey, thanks for the jet pack!
- Oopsie-daisy.
- LIoyd, did you just fart?
Maybe.
Well, something stinks.
Maybe it's this...
mix tape I made you.
Or maybe these flowers.
- Uh... thanks LIoyd.
- Yeah.
So are you ready to take me
to the principal's office?
Yeah. So no small talk, huh?
Yeah. Good,
because I'm not
a big fan of the small talk.
So how about this weather?
Hey, Jessica,
I'm coming!
So I see
you've started without me.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
Let's just do it
and get out of here.
Wow, straight to the business.
Okay.
Let me just get ready.
Aah, I can't
get it off.
I'm so close
I can feel it.
I never should've
switched from Velcro!
Oh, wait,
I got it!
- I got it.
- That's it. I'm done.
This just didn't work out
like I thought it would.
Did you at Ieast
enjoy yourself?
No, it was
a complete waste of time.
This is--
this is embarrassing.
This has never happened
to me before.
- That's my boyfriend.
- Boyfriend?
What was all that talk
about you riding on my waxer?
Thanks, LIoyd, but I didn't find
what I was Iooking for.
And can you do me a favor
and clean this place up?
Principal Collins
can't know that we were here.
Yeah, no problem.
I don't kiss and tell!
Huh!
Ooh.
Dirty girl.
Oh my God,

I found Harry's treasure.
Ohh!
Oh, it's heavy.
It must be fully Ioaded.
Harry!
Harry!
Hey, I found the treasure.
- Go away, ass-face!
- Did you hear what I said, Harry?
The treasure,
Iike on your map.
Yeah, right. Why don't you go
show it to your girlfriend?
Jessica and I
are through, Harry. Yeah.
I couldn't stand being with her
knowing that you Iiked her.
It just wasn't worth
our friendship.
Oh, you know, and also
she had a boyfriend.
Did you hear something,
Captain Rob?
- Captain Rob came back?
- Yeah, he does sound Iike a rat-fink.
Hey th-- there's no reason
to use that kind of Ianguage.
Good one, Captain Rob.
He does Iook Iike a you-know-what.
We're telling

You know what?
That's it.

Where is it?
Baby, I'm going to spend
the morning at the mall.
- You know, shop for Waikiki.
- Where the hell is it?
A lot of stuff we could
use for the trip.
- What are you Iooking for?
- My chest.
- The chest I keep my papers in?
- What papers?
The documents, the photos,
the tapes.
- The evidence.
- Evidence of what?
Sweetheart, keep up
with me for half a minute.
The evidence of every scam
we've ever pulled,
the evidence that's going
to put us away for 20 years.
- Where is it?!
- I don't know, it's not here.
Somebody stole it.
Jessica.
- What Jessica?
- That girl...
who tried to follow me
on the field trip?
- She took it.
- Are you sure?
Yeah. Oh, she's been snooping around,
asking questions.
Hmm.
Well...
- I'II take care of her.
- Yeah?
You gonna kill her?
No. No, I'm not--
I'm not gonna kill her.
Honey, why don't you see to it the kids
are ready for the parade, okay?
- Okay.
- Yeah.
And I think I'II pay Jessica...
a Iittle visit.
Thanksgiving Day parade
is almost here.
So, any ideas for a float?
- Ooh, a raft!
- A blimp!
- A turd.
- Titanic.
- A platypus.
- Corn dog.
- Message in a bottle.
- No, not things that float,
ideas for a float. You know,
Iike if you see a parade
and people are...?
Can I hear
from anyone else?
- Hello.
- Hi, Ching Chung. What do you have?
Uh...
...Iicka Iicka pow!
She's saying
"beautiful swan..."
"...flying gracefully
over the rice fields..."
...Roy Orbison.
...to the tune
of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
No, now come on,
you guys.
Focus, think.
Put your thinking caps on.
What do you think of
when you think of Thanksgiving?
- Like cranberries and Indians.
- Football!
Football, yeah!
Get some!
Good for you.
No.
Oh hey, Lewis has got a good idea.
George Washington.
- Wow!
- Who?
- He only invented money.
- Very good, Lloyd.
How about a float of George Washington
crossing the Delaware?
- Ooh, or maybe a river.
- Like the Atlantic.
Okay, so it's settled.
This is gonna be
the greatest Thanksgiving ever.
You mean we have to-- we have
to parade around in front of everyone?
On a float
of George Washington?
- We're gonna Iook Iike idiots.
- Exactly.
No chance. We are not doing it.
No effing way.
Hey!
Hey, did I mention
that if you don't make a float,
it's back to homework?
And... real grades.
How would you like that?
Oh-- and actually having
to attend class.
No.
Which means, you won't be
so special anymore.
กำ Crack that whip กำ
กำ Give the past

Hey, guys, check it out.
Thanks, Principal Collins,
for giving me this interview.
Anything I can do to help.
So, you had some questions?
Yes, actually.
Last year, Toby was
in AP English,
and Lewis won
the science fair.
What are they doing in this
new special needs class?
Well, that's
a poor question.
It's wordy, pedantic-- a good
question gets right to the point.
Example--
where's my chest?
Chest? I don't know
what you're talking about.
Oh, I think you do.
You know, my parents
are gonna wonder where I am.
One phone call from the principal
will take care of that, my dear.
Hello, it's me, Brenda.
Jessica's friend?
Yeah, we're going to be
pulling an all-nighter
in the Iibrary tonight,
'cause we have a big exam tomorrow.
Macro... economics,
and it's really hard.
Ooh, they still have
my two favorite flavors,
cherry and green.
- Yeah.
- Oh, hey, fellas.
You want some of this?
Yeah.
Oh, it's gonna be good.
You know what?
I'm gonna go crazy.
I'm gonna have two flavors.
Suicide of deliciousness.
- That Iooks so tasty, Harry.
- Oh God, I want that.
- He's mixing them.
- Oh, it's gonna taste so good.
I was right.
It's really good.
He's so Iucky.
Mmm, mmm.
Suck it.
I want one.
We can't go in there.
We'II be it.
You're right...
we can't.
Come here.
Hey, hey, Iittle buddy.
Hi, how ya doin'?
Hey, you want
to make $2?
- Sure.
- Yeah?
AII you got to do is go in there
and get us two SIushees.
- Okay.
- Okay, as in we got a deal?
Yeah, deal.
But first,
give me the $2.
I said "doll hairs."
Psych. But a deal's a deal.
In you go, Iittle buddy.
- Come on.
- Fine, give me the doll hairs.
- Harry?
- A deal's a deal.
Would you take
five bucks instead?
Good thinking, Harry.
Good thinking.
AII right, be cool.
Be cool.
Be cool.
Yeah, and she's Iike,
"You better call my mom."
And I'm Iike, "Whoa,"
and she's Iike, "Oh."
And I'm Iike, "Whoa,"
and she's Iike, "Oh."
And I'm Iike...
it's Brenda.
I'm new.
Oh! Ice, ice, baby.
Yeah, I peed in those.
Enjoy.
Grow up.
- You're it.
- Are not.
- Are too.
- D2.
- Chewbacca.
- Ooh, good one, Harry.
Hey, it's Jessica.
Harry, I thought
we worked through this.
No, it's Jessica.
Oh, must be her boyfriend's car.
- It's Principal Collins!
- Principal Collins is Jessica's boyfriend?
Oh, that totally makes sense.
That's why she didn't
want him to know
we were in his office
the other night.
He can't see us here.
Quick, be conspicuous!
Conspicuous?
No wonder we both
struck out with her.
How can we compete with
the sexual power of the man
who occupies
the highest office in the Iand.
Yeah, he's Iike the Pope, Harry.
Like we're gonna
snake a chick from the Pope.
Here he comes.
Harry, switch.
Harry.
Jeez, Moses and Mary.
Hey, Iet's go spy on them.
Good thinking, Harry.
- Harry, bobsled!
- Lever!
Hang two!
Harry, go Ieft!
Go Ieft.
Cease and desist!
Cease and desist!
Come on, Harry!
Mush, mush, mush.
Harry, go straight.
Warp speed, Harry. Warp speed!
Is that the best you've got?
Hey, that's my cart.
กำ It's the eye of the tiger,
it's the thrill of the fight กำ
กำ Risin' up to the challenge
of our rivals กำ
กำ And the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night... กำ
Ice cream?
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking, Harry?
- Oh yeah.
- Snack break!
Yummy!
- Aaah! AII right--
- Harry!
- There they are!
- Break's over!
So what did you tell
my parents on the phone?
Not to expect you
tonight.
Well, someone's going
to come looking for me.
Oh, I don't think so,
my dear.
กำ The eye of the tiger. กำ
I'm going to ask you
one more time.
Jessica,
where's my chest?
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Don't know what I'm
talking about, hmm?
You don't know
what I'm talking about?!
Well, well, well.
What have we here?
It appears to be a tape.
- That's not your tape.
- Don't play with me, dear.
You're way
out of your Ieague.
Jessica!
Harry, LIoyd.
You guys are a mess.
We were still hungry, so we
decided to get some dessert.
- It was fun.
- Yeah.
It was fun until Harry decided
to put his wiener in my ear.
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.
So it Iooks Iike
the best man won.
Why didn't you tell us
your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
What?
Jessica!
- กำ You light up my life... กำ
- Is that my mix tape?
It's being used for your seduction?
I'm flattered.
LIoyd, when we were
in Principal Collins office,
did you see any kind
of chest?
You mean Iike Harry's treasure chest?
Sure, I know where that is.
You found my treasure?
Why didn't you tell me?
Three words-- I did.
You were just all mad at me.
You wouldn't even Iisten.
- Yeah, well, I'm Iistening now.
- Me too.
- This is my favorite part.
- Harry, LIoyd,
Iisten to me, I only have
time to say this once.
God, she's so cute.
Look at her teeth.
I bet she can
bite through anything.
Yeah, she could.
You gotta get what's in the chest,
and make sure everybody...
I wonder what Lloyd's
thinking about.
Look at all that hair.
She must have millions
of tiny holes in her head.
Otherwise, it would just
bunch up all in her brain.
So guys,
are you Iistening to me?
- Yeah, sure!
- Yeah, yeah.
- I was, you know--
- Yeah, sure.
I'm a Pisces.
And that's the sign of the badger.
I love picnics...
You guys gotta go
get that chest,
and show the world
what Collins has been doing.
Don't worry about me. I can
get out of this anytime I want.
And I'm getting the story every
high school reporter dreams of.
Come on, Jessica.
Don't push me,
'cause I'm...
Go, get out of here.
- Gotcha, you--
- Stop!
- What?
- I don't think this is the right thing to do.
Harry, we don't even know
what's in there. You're overreacting.
I don't know
who we are anymore.
You're right.
But I feel Iike I deserve
much more of this treasure
- 'cause I was the one that found it.
- My mom gave me the map.
- But I Iugged it all over town.
- I made the polar bear pants.
- I ate your mom's pie!
- I found that rock!
It was a diamond,
and you swallowed it.
We were all out
of top hats.
Enough! What has
this cursed chest done to us?
You know, LIoyd,
the real treasure
is our friendship.
Yeah, you're right.
On the other hand...
Oh.
What's all this?
Oh...
it's full of files.
There's pictures
and documents.
It's amazing!
Ohhh.
Hey, LIoyd, this Iooks
Iike one of your mix tapes.
Maybe it's from the pirate
who buried this treasure.
You should go put it on.
Principal's log, September 23rd.
Check, check, check.
Sound check.
Hey, it's Principal Collins.
That makes total sense. I found
the treasure chest in his office.
-...grant money...
- This mix tape isn't as good as yours.
- No.
- Sound, check, check, check.
- He speaks pretty good Chinese.
- That's not Chinese.
That's Chinese.
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.
And that is how l,
Principal Collins,
became the mastermind
behind this glorious plan.
It's the crime
of the century.
He's right. We have committed
the crime of the century.
We never thanked him
for giving us the special needs class!
But what do we do?
I have an idea.
Welcome to
the Providence Hills High School
Thanksgiving parade!
Aren't you glad
you're not watching football?
This year's theme,
white meat or dark?
Floats and exhibits from
all classes and organizations.
So enjoy.
What the hell is that?
What did you morons do?
Where's George Washington?
What do we do with this?
- Looks great, doesn't he?
- No.
What were you guys thinking?
Why'd you give him
a makeover?
Sorry I'm Iate.
Woke up tied to the bed.
Somebody cut my hair
while I was sleeping.
Hey, that's my hair!
It's the marching band's
musical tribute to stuffing.
Please do not throw cigarettes
at the floats.
I've searched everywhere
and no Iuck.
The chest is
still out there.
That's why we get the check
as soon as Zimmer shows up
and blow this pop stand before
anybody finds out anything.
The band
sounds terrible.
I know, I sold all
the wind instruments.
Hawaiian Air,
business class.
- You Iike your new coat?
- I Iove it.
That's why our mascot
isn't a stallion anymore.
- This is horse?
- No, no, no, I sold the horse,
- to pay for the--
- I didn't know horse could feel this soft.
That's not horse, honey.
Yes, yes, it is soft.
So what do you think
of the float?
- Guys, this is much better.
- Yeah.
Principal Collins is
a way greater American
than George Washington
will ever be.
I don't get it.
Why'd you make him a pirate?
I'II tell you why.
You won't believe these documents.
They provide evidence of a Iong history
of fraud and embezzlement
from the school by Principal Collins
and Ms. Heller,
A.K.A. the Iunch Iady.
- Huh?
- My God, can you believe your ears?
Yeah, no clicks
and whistles.
She speaks the English
perfectly.
LIoyd, you're
a great teacher.
Ching Chong, what happened
to your beautiful Asian accent?
Oh, actually my name
is Cindy.
The accent just
helps me meet boys.
You want it back?
You got it, Joe.
Look at this. Collins took $2000
that was supposed to go to
a new state-of-the-art
stallion mascot uniform.
Wait, what?
Let me see.
Why have I been wearing this one
with puke in the head?
- You serious?
- Am I-- smell.
We got to tell people
about Collins.
- Hey, Superintendent.
- I'm not sure I can do this.
We got to nail this guy.
You'II be fine.
Just make sure
he takes that check.
Detective, you know,
he's gonna be expecting
Moffitt to be... special.
Don't worry about it. I studied
acting at the police academy.
- Police academy?
- You'II be fine.
Just remember your lines.
It's show time.
- Principal Collins.
- Superintendent Zimmer.
- Hello.
- Hello, hello.
I'd Iike to introduce you
to Richard Moffitt,
former special needs student,
now American success story.
- Well...
- Go ahead.
It's a very great
pleasure to meet you, sir.
Very...
very great pleasure.
Well, is that
what I think it is?
Your Iittle gift
for the school?
Yes.
I drew this.
Special needs.
- Time for french fries now.
- Oh, yes.
But the check will be
presented this morning?
I'm very strong.
Yes, you are.
I have your check right here.
But I think Mr. Moffitt is
interested in seeing
the special needs float first.
I can turn on
all the faucets in my house.
Even the hose.
But we don't drink
from the hose, do we?
No.
There's the special needs float.
Oh, here they come! Wait till you see
what the children have done.
Yes.
This is visionary.
I think I've finally figured
out a way to bilk this school
out of enough money to get us
that condo in Waikiki.
- Baby, you've done it all.
- Small potatoes.
The Richard Moffitt
special needs grant.
The state is giving
- to every school that has...
- That sounds Iike you!
Oh my God,
they got the chest.
- You got the extender?
- No.
Nothing they do makes any sense,
which is-- which is--
which is why we created
the special needs class...
You're going down, Collins!
and why we need that check.
He stole the school's money!
Pony.
Hey, there's Principal Collins!
Please remain seated.
Somebody stop him!
Huh, he's coming back.
Whoa, whoa!
Wow! Go!
Hey, hey!
Hey!
Check in hand.
AII I wanted
was a condo in Waikiki.
- Watch your hands, piggy!
- Get in the car.
Wow, they get
their own police escort.
Whoa.
AII our hard work pays off.
- Yeah?
- He's going to jail for a Iong time.
Principal of jail?
Wow, that's a promotion.
- Yeah, those inmates are Iucky.
- Yeah.
- Hey, Jessica!
- Hi!
I-- I guess
I'II see you guys Iater.
Oh my God.
She's two-timing Principal Collins.
Yeah, with that complete loser.
- He's probably a jock.
- Jessica, what are you thinking?
Check out those stupid
butt-ugly jeans.
You know what, Harry?
This whole experience
has soured me
on women forever.
Yeah, we should never Iet
a woman come between us again.
That's not going to happen.
We Iearned a very valuable Iesson here.
- We're not ever gonna forget that.
- Yeah.
Excuse us.
You're Harry and LIoyd, right?
- Actually, I'm Harry and he's LIoyd.
- LIoyd.
Well, we're the Felchers.
My name's Freida,
and this is Rita.
- Hi, boys.
- Hi.
We're gonna go check out
the all-girls college.
Do you guys wanna come?
- Sure!
- No, wait, Harry, Harry!
Just a second.
We're just gonna...
Listen, we got to figure out who gets who,
all right? No more competition.
- Right.
- Okay, so... ahem. Pick one.
The one on the Ieft.
- What's wrong?
- That's the one that I wanted.
- No.
- Yeah.
She's one of a kind.
Try one in a million.
What should we do?
- You take her.
- No, I'm not going to do that to you.
It's okay, Harry,
I'II find somebody.
I'm not doing it.
Remember,
chicks are for fags.
That's a good one, Harry.
I'II handle this.
Yeah. Why don't you go ahead
and go on without us?
What?
What do you mean?
Someday you might meet somebody
as special as my friend Harry up there,
but I doubt it.
Oh and uh...
your Iittle friend over there,
she's-- she's nice too.
What?!
Look out, Harry!
Oh, Harry! Oh God, Harry!
Oh God, Harry!
Losers!
Oh! Oh, that was close,
huh, Harry?
Oh! I got dirt on my shirt.
How gross is this?
Harry?
Ohh!
Harry? You got to Iook
both ways, buddy.
Charlie!
- Oh my God.
- Hey.
It's you.
You're the guy
that crapped up my house!
What are you--
you're covered in shit!
What are you--
my car's covered in shit!
- No, no, it's not that.
- Oh my God! No, stop!
- What are you doing?!
- Not helping.
- There's shit all over my car!
- Harry, Harry, Iet's go.
What is wrong with you?!
- You okay, buddy?
- Yeah.
- There's poo all over my hood!
- What's up with that guy?
Beat's me.
He's Jessica's dad.
- She says he's really anal.
- Ohh, ooh!
- That's gross.
- I know.
There's shit everywhere!
Hey, come back here!
I'm not cleaning this up!
I'm gonna have to have this towed.
Come back here!
Are you out of your minds?!
What is it with you
and fecal matter?!
Look at this!
Four, tres, two, uno.
That's enough!
That--
- That's enough!
- Aaah!
- CIass dismissed!
- Come on, Harry.
- Lewis!
- SIow, easy boy!
Oh, snaps!
Hi.
Mrs. D., you sure have
a great Iooking pie.
You put your meat
in my mom's pie.
You're it!
And no tap--
It was him.
Enou-- oh shit,
I'm sorry.
Get back, get back.
- Why are you dressed Iike that?
- 'Cause you said!
- No, Harry, I said,
"Don't dress Iike a queen!"
Oh.
Get up, get up,
get up, get up!
Uh... so...
you're not in the store, huh?
Yeah, we're closed.
Get outta here.
Actually, we have
something for you.
You're it.
Are we even filming?
Don't you--
don't you snap
at me Iike that.
Don't you snap at me Iike that.
You're Iucky--
Don't you snap
at me Iike--
That is shit!
Oh, God, aaah!
Harry--
Stop!
- Harry, LIoyd--

Why've I been...
Okay, back to one.
You want me to say

Oh my God!
Ohh!
Oopsie-daisy.

Did you just fart?
Cut it.
