but I'm very shook up.
I got my American
Express card stolen.
GEORGE: Yes.
Right.
Yes. Helen.
Easafawn.
Helen Easafawn.
E-A
S-A-fawn.
Hi. I have no legs.
May I speak to the manager?
Now, if I get a bill
and it's something,
like, for...
But two times in a row I eat
the damn roast beef and I'm...
I can't stop
going to the bathroom!
MAN: Ma?
And my son
thinks I'm crazy.
Ma, who you calling?
It's Jerry's.
And don't tell me
not to call them.
Jesus Christ, get off
the fucking phone!
Don't talk
to me that way!
Get off the
fucking phone!
What's going on?
Did she... What'd
she call you about?
The roast beef?
All right, she just
puked in the kitchen.
I... I appreciate
your suggestions,
but I love roast beef.
It's delicious!
MAN: Go clean
up the mess!
I can't.
Get off of me!
You son of a bitch!
George?
GIRL: Hi,
Mr. Simmons.
Ladies.
George Simmons, man!
Can I get a picture?
Yeah, yeah. You got it ready?
All right, hit me,
baby, all right.
Get a little
tittie in there.
Come on.
How are you?
You're really funny.
Thank you.
You're funnier.
Hello.
Hi!
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Hey, what's up?
GEORGE: Hey.
How are you?
Hey, handsome.
Doctor.
How are you, kid?
How are you, baby?
The Lunestas
are working, baby.
Those are smooth.
No hangover.
Fall asleep, bam.
Fucking what was
the deal with the Restorils?
Why did you give me those?
You trying to fuck
with me or something?
George, we got the results
back from the follow-up
of your blood count
and it's not
what we hoped for.
As I mentioned earlier,
the CBC was abnormal.
Your white blood cells
were four times the size
that they should be.
And very low hemoglobin,
seven grams per deciliter.
I don't understand
what you're saying right now.
Can you speak
how people speak?
You have a very
serious disease.
It's called AML.
It's a form of leukemia
and I can't predict
how this will play out,
but I feel you have
a rough road ahead of you.
That's George Simmons,
right here.
George! George!
George Simmons!
Hey, man!
How, how you doing, man?
I'm a big fan of yours.
I'm sorry to say
we're past the point
where traditional structures
like chemotherapy
and radiation would
be effective at all.
CHUCK: Here you go, ma'am.
Your tamales.
Thanks for shopping
at Otto's.
Yo, Chuck,
I'm going up at the
Comedy & Magic Club
doing stand-up.
You should
come watch me.
Don't let him
suck you in.
He's not funny.
Nah, he's right, man.
No way, man.
That shit was painful.
I mean,
it was hard watching
you suffer up there.
I had fucking
nightmares after that.
That was a long time ago.
That was months ago.
I've gotten a lot
funnier since then.
Then you bored
my wife to sleep.
I couldn't get
no pussy
that night, man.
Don't blame me
for your pussy issues.
Are they gonna pay you?
Pay me? No!
That's just how it starts.
You don't get paid
in the beginning.
You gotta, you know,
work your way up
through the ranks.
My nigger,
how the fuck you
in show business
when you got no
business to show?
I'm supposed
to be writing jokes.
I'm supposed
to be doing comedy.
I'm not supposed to be
making macaroni salad.
I hate it, man.
It's depressing.
Otto's sucks!
You don't know about
no motherfucking
hard time, man.
I'm a ex-convict, man.
Otto's the only place
that would hire me.
You too good
for Otto's now?
I'm not too
good for it.
I just don't...
It's not for me,
you know, I'm sorry.
See that bridge?
Okay.
On the house, man!
Otto, man!
Otto's my lotto.
Come on, man, look.
I can't work here
anymore, all right?
What, you gonna be on TV
or some shit like that?
I am gonna be on TV.
The chunky guy
on  or some shit?
No, I'm gonna
be like Seinfeld.
Get the fuck
out of here, man!
You ain't gonna
be like Seinfeld.
Seinfeld's my
motherfucking man!
Now Kramer,
Kramer gets a pass from me
'cause Kramer's my nigger.
Well, very
forgiving of you.
Look, as a friend, man,
let me tell you something.
You're not funny.
I think I'm funny.
I got new jokes, man,
and they're good.
Let me hear one
of your new jokes.
Okay, I got one like,
I'm really good
at
you know, on PlayStation,
and I was so good at it,
I thought, like, "Maybe
I should get a guitar."
Then I thought like,
"I'm really good at
"maybe I should start
beating up hookers."
Okay, that got me.
That was humorous.
I thought
you'd like that.
But, yo, I ain't
got no dough, man.
For real, if I had
some dough, I would go.
I'll pay your
cover charge.
That's the night
I take my wife out also,
so you gotta pay
for my bitch, too.
Okay, I'll do it. Okay.
If you come and laugh.
Laugh loud.
Like that?
That's good. Perfect.
I'll see you
Saturday then.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Hey, Laura, it's George.
How's the northern side
of California going?
I was wondering
if you had
a few minutes.
I wanted to talk
to you about something.
Actually, I don't.
I was just walking
out the door.
Is it okay if I get
your number and I'll give
you a call back later?
I just wanted
to let you know that,
that I really am so
sorry about everything.
I'm sorry, I screwed up.
anyway, I gotta go.
Do you want me
to call you back?
but I just wanted
to let you know I was
sorry one more time.
Okay.
You know, so, like,
I have this joke about how,
like, you never see, like,
a very attractive,
blonde, big-breasted
homeless woman.
You know, like, someone
will take care of that
person no matter what.
That woman's gonna be fine.
All right,
so here's the joke.
You can be attractive
and stupid and make it
in the world.
Yeah.
And you could
be unattractive
and smart
and make it
in the world.
Yeah.
But it's the ugly,
dumb people who
are really screwed
'cause they're ignorant
and an eyesore.
That's funny, man.
That's pretty funny.
I think that'll work.
I was thinking of doing
this thing where, like,
I'm not good-looking
and I'm not bad-looking.
I'm kind of, like,
right in the middle,
you know.
Like... Like, if I had
a good personality, I could
get any chick in the world,
but I don't.
Yeah, it doesn't work.
I auditioned
for Budd Friedman
at the Improv.
He okayed me
and made me a regular.
Budd won't even
look me in the eye.
Man, that's...
Good for you, man.
Congratulations.
You shouldn't have lost
all that weight, man.
There's nothing funny
about a physically-fit man.
I know.
It's lame, right?
Yeah.
No one wants to watch
Lance Armstrong do comedy.
Oh, God.
Hey, Ira.
Oh, hey, Mark.
Can you do me a favor
and never leave a paycheck
from your shit
sitcom on my pillow
ever again, please?
That is so rude
of me to accidentally
leave my paycheck
for $25,000
on your pillow.
I'm sorry.
It's a dick move.
It's just,
they keep coming,
you know,
week after week.
It's getting a little bit hard
to keep track of them all.
You know what?
Becoming marginally famous
has really turned
you into an asshole.
Now listen, I'd love to stay
here and chat with you,
but we have company.
You know that girl comedian
who lives across the street?
The one with the dark hair
and the bangs?
Daisy, yeah.
Daisy, right.
Well, I bumped into her
outside and I invited her in,
and she's sitting
in our living room
right now.
She's out there
right now?
She's hot and she's mousy,
but kind of like...
She's mousy
like a mouse you want
to stick your dick in.
Yeah, you've gotta get
out there and talk to her.
Why would you do that?
What do you mean,
why would I do that?
I'm trying to hook you up.
Well, I'm laying
groundwork, man.
I got a three-month plan.
You can't just
throw me into this.
I'll give you 10 days
on your three-month plan.
No, I need 80
more days than that!
Okay, I do this
because I care about you.
I do this to motivate you.
But I will fuck that girl
in 10 days. I promise.
Come on, dude,
I'm not cute like you.
I don't look
like Jackson Browne.
I look like Jon Favreau!
Don't do this to me.
Don't make me fuck her.
Well, then just
don't fuck her!
Don't you put me
in this corner where
I have to fuck my way out.
He'll do it, too. He'll do it.
I've seen him do this before.
I'm gonna go out
there and warm her up.
I'll see you out there.
I know it's silly,
but it's fun.
You know, people like it.
Yeah.
You know?
It's just cool that
you're on TV. I mean...
I can't believe you
haven't seen this before.
Yeah, I can't believe
it's gotten by me.
Is it on a kids channel? WB?
A teen channel or something?
MARK: No. It's on NBC.
DAISY: Really?
Ira, this is Daisy.
Oh!
Daisy, Ira.
Hi.
How are you?
How's it going?
Good.
Actually, I have a cold,
so I shouldn't...
Oh!
Air shake.
I've actually seen you
do comedy at the Improv
a couple times.
Yeah, you're really...
You're really, really funny.
Oh, thanks.
You know, Ira
just lost 20 pounds.
Oh, congratulations.
Yes, I did.
All from my cock.
Um... So...
So, this episode right here
is actually a two-parter.
Great, so does that
mean we're gonna watch
both parts right now?
Oh, shoot. Oh, God.
You need some help
with that, Ira?
No! No, it's...
It's okay, I got it.
I got it. I got it.
Mmm.
I'm joking.
I'll get a rag.
See you in nine days, Ira!
I can't believe this
is what people like.
Killed it, man.
Crowd was crazy.
Is it always that wild
on a Wednesday?
No, they were...
They seem pretty
good out there.
I'm really
stepping up
my game.
These bitches gotta
start paying me for this.
Can't get no more free Randy.
I just fucked that
crowd in the ass.
Yeah.
Just awesome.
Just fucking bam!
Crowd, me, bam! Crowd, me...
My stand-up's my dick.
You know?
I'm gonna do
the same thing.
Bullshit! Let's get some
M&M's and chips going.
Yellow!
MAN: Ira!
Hey. Kevin Rooney
didn't show up,
so you're gonna do
Really? Okay.
Thanks. Yeah.
"Yeah,
thanks, yeah."
Hey.
Did he just tell you
you're going on next?
Yeah, I'm on next.
Okay. Well,
I'm on after you,
and if you go long,
this is going
to die in my pocket.
That wasn't a joke.
I'm not a comic.
Okay, when you get the light
that means one minute.
Okay.
He loves me. "
Hey. George Simmons
just showed up.
He wants to go on,
so you are bumped.
Okay, how long
does he do?
How the fuck
should I know?
He hasn't been here
in five years, but
you gotta be ready.
Okay.
Okay.
See that?
I fucking killed out there.
Yeah, that was good.
Watch out,
Leo, watch out.
All my new shit worked.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was supposed
to go on after you.
George Simmons showed up.
Now I'm gonna
go on after him.
George Simmons
is going up right now?
Yeah.
I just opened
for George Simmons?
Yeah.
That's fucking
awesome, man!
Let's watch it together. "
in the ground. "
a nightmare tonight. "
Simmons is getting
a little dark.
What is he doing?
Give me a break.
Yo! Hey! Hey!
This fucking guy.
What's up?
Hey. I'm sorry.
I'm parked right on
the other side of you
and I can't get in.
What, you come here
to make some jokes
to my face now?
You're hard to follow.
I didn't know what to say.
I'm sorry about that.
No, don't be.
I would've done the same.
You had to comment on it.
Yeah, you had
some funny shit.
You're a good writer.
Thank you.
Your friend...
Is that your friend?
The fatter version of you?
He's my roommate.
Yeah, he's really funny.
You got good stuff.
You're gonna be all right.
Wow, that is so nice
of you to say, man.
That's so...
I appreciate it. Hey!
You know, well, I've been
a really big fan of yours.
All of us.
We kind of grew up
on your shit and,
you know, incidentally.
So, that's so nice of you
to say, man. Thanks.
Thank you!
Nice to meet you, man!
You're gonna die!
And I'm gonna
kill you!
Man, that was awesome.
LEO: Cats.
Can you dig it?
Mmm-hmm.
Just a bunch of cats.
Then me doing stuff.
Then back to the
cats doing stuff.
You've gotten 700,000 hits
in four days from this?
Yep. If you put
"cute kitten" in the title
of your YouTube video,
you're gonna get
a million hits.
Mmm-hmm.
And then I link
that to my website
and you can see my
stand-up on my website.
It's genius.
Why don't you
just call it like,
"Megan Fox Blows Someone"?
And then more people
would google that.
Hi. I've got two girls
coming over here
in a little bit.
Can you fold up
your bed, please,
into the couch?
I don't want the place
to look like a mess
when they get here.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I was watching this thing.
MARK: All right? Okay.
Hello?
Fuck you, Craig.
What's happening, man?
Oh!
I'm sorry. Hey.
Hey, how's it going, man?
Hey, hey,
good job last night.
You guys were pretty funny.
You and the triple-XL
version of you.
Oh. Yeah. Thank...
Thank you. That's...
I... Well, I appreciate that.
I'm doing this
corporate gig
for MySpace
and I'm gonna need
some jokes and shit.
I was thinking maybe you guys
would want to write me some.
You know, he's kind of
a flaky guy, but I'm...
I've got nothing
going on, man.
I would...
I'd love to do that.
Sure. Totally. I'm in.
Just shit about them
or computers
or whatever they like.
So, you want to be held
accountable, come watch
me do them tomorrow?
Okay, cool, yeah.
How should I...
How should I...
How should I get them to you?
I can give you my fax
number and my e-mail.
What's your e-mail?
My e-mail?
It's irasexira@yahoo.com.
Wow. I'm just... I'm starting
to reconsider asking you.
Yeah, you should
change it.
I mean change it now.
Okay, I'll change it,
I'll change it ASAP.
Okay, Ira.
All right, Ira.
Guys, that was
George Simmons
on the phone.
He saw me
do stand-up.
He thinks I'm funny!
He wants me
to write jokes for him!
What?
Yep!
Why?
Why? He thinks I'm funny!
This doesn't make
any sense at all.
No?
Jeez, I gotta
get started.
What is happening?
You forgot about the bed!
Friends.
Friends on MySpace.
Nerds.
Nerds... Nerds have
no friends in real life.
The more friends on MySpace,
the less friends
you have in real life.
"How does the softball
team at MySpace work?
"Does everyone
get picked last?"
That could be funny.
At some point, you should have
George say, "Fuck Facebook!"
"Fuck Facebook in the face!"
So, like, that's funny.
All right, tell George
I wrote that, okay?
Totally. Totally, man.
You gotta be like,
"Leo wrote that."
Yeah, no, no, no, totally.
Hey, Ira,
I think this is him!
He's got a limo!
Can we go out
and meet him?
No, no, no.
You can't say
hi to him.
Just let me get in
with him a little more
before I introduce
people to him.
Don't kiss his ass
too hard, all right?
Stars hate it
when you kiss
their ass too hard.
I hate it when people
kiss my ass too hard.
You do?
You hate it when people
kiss your ass too hard?
I hate it.
Man!
Hey. I feel like
we're going to prom.
Okay, well, we're not.
Okay, let's hit it!
This is good.
I like this one
about the guy from MySpace
and the guy from Craigslist
getting into a fight.
That's funny.
You're excited.
I am excited.
Yeah, that's good.
It's good to be excited.
I used to be excited.
Well, it's awesome.
It's exciting.
Wow!
GEORGE: Thank you!
Yeah!
Brought the nice legs
with you. Good job.
Hello, hello.
Good to see you, sir.
Welcome aboard.
Thank you.
The name's Dave.
Hi, Dave.
We may hit a few
bumps up there,
nothing too crazy.
We'll get you there.
Okay, cool!
All right.
Hope you enjoy
Chinese food.
I love it!
Very good.
Enjoy your flight.
Thank you.
Wow!
You guys were a little late,
so we had to put up
James Taylor first.
that I'm cryin', ain't I
How'd you guys get him?
Everybody's got
their price.
Last year, we had Roger Waters
doing
Okay, I thought it could
be funny if you just go,
"Fuck Facebook in the face!"
All right.
Hey, you do five minutes
before I go up there.
What? No. No, I can't
follow
Are you kidding me, man?
I can't follow it, either.
That's why you're going
up there.
I can't believe that.
He did the Facebook joke!
Yeah!
He did the Facebook...
I can't follow this, man.
I can't go on right now.
Give me this shit.
Get up there. Be a man.
Yeah, do you
actually use MySpace?
No, no, no. I fuck girls, Tom.
I don't have time for that.
Eh?
What the fuck
was that all about?
You did all the jokes
you wrote for me.
Oh, man, I know.
I'm sorry. I panicked.
It's all they wanted.
They just wanted
MySpace jokes.
They didn't want...
That's why I hired you
to write me MySpace jokes.
I know, I'm sorry.
That one,
I didn't tell that one.
That one will work.
I guarantee you.
It better work.
They're paying me
Really?
on the computer. "
is butterscotch. "
Do you ever get tired
of singing the same songs,
you know, over and over?
Do you ever get tired
of talking about your dick?
You want to do it? All right. "
That wasn't a pee,
that was a shit.
That took too long.
Here's 1,000 bucks.
Good job.
Thank you so much, man.
I've never made this much
money doing anything, man.
Thank you.
Good.
I'm thinking about doing
a lot more stand-up.
Okay.
And my assistant
got pregnant.
I didn't even know she...
I thought she was
a fucking lesbian
the whole time, but...
They can get
pregnant, too.
That's nice.
That's very nice.
Yeah.
So, you want to kind
of assist me, you know?
Yeah! Yeah.
I mean, not, not...
I mean, you can write
jokes for me, too,
but get me sodas...
Whatever you need, man!
...and, like,
clean my shit up and...
Yeah.
How much money
you make now?
It depends
on how many hours.
Usually,
I can get about...
I'll give you
That's amazing, man.
Thank you so much.
You want to fuck
these two girls?
Hey, the JT.
George.
That was the best.
You killed them.
Ira.
Hello.
Yes, Mr. Taylor.
Yes, hello.
You wanna fuck
these girls?
I filled my quota
in 1982, I believe.
All right, I'll have
to figure this shit out.
I know those girls.
You do?
Do you want
to meet those girls?
Will you fucking settle down?
Yeah, talk to them.
Be gentle.
You're twitching
like a fucking madman.
That guy in porno?
No. I would know.
No?
Mandy.
Well, hi there.
You're still swimming?
Get the fuck out of there.
I'm ready for you.
Yeah. Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Feel that stomach.
Oh. Yeah.
I like that thing.
Good. Well, go for it.
It's hard. Bam!
MANDY: This house is crazy.
GEORGE: Oh, yeah,
you got to see
the whole thing.
Come here.
It came furnished.
Really?
GEORGE: That's my man, Ira.
He wrote a lot of good
jokes for me there, honey.
Make sure he shows
you his cock.
It's very, very thick.
See you, George.
Hey, wanna have a contest
to see who can hold
their breath the longest?
You didn't go under.
Nothing's gonna
happen between us.
I can't believe
I'm having sex
with George Simmons.
Yeah, he can't
believe it, either.
My dad loves
your movies.
Yeah, that's the best
when you talk
about your dad.
Oh! You're still here.
I know that asshole.
You two were
just fucking, huh?
How'd that go?
No, I have a boyfriend.
We already talked about it.
Yeah. John.
Yeah.
Your friend took off.
She thought you left, so...
Really?
That's what happens
in a big house.
It's called
"the big house
problem."
Your friend actually
left her purse
down the hall.
You want to go
get it with me?
Oh. Okay.
Don't you leave
on me, Ira.
Fuck me like MerMan!
Come on! Do MerMan!
Do the MerMan call!
Come on!
Oh, yeah!
Yeah! Oh, God!
Hey.
Oh. Hey.
Sorry about
the chick, man. I...
You weren't getting it done,
so something had to happen.
Oh, that's... No, she...
I wasn't even trying.
She told me
she had a boyfriend.
Oh, yeah. She told me
she had a boyfriend, too.
What the fuck are you doing
with that big dick of yours?
You gotta use it!
You gotta share
Thickie with the world.
I don't... It's normal.
You want to go upstairs, man?
Talk to me while
I try to fall asleep?
Okay, if...
Yeah, if that's
what you want me to do.
Yeah, yeah.
Sit down, man.
That was a fun night.
That was a good night.
Yeah, that was crazy.
Yeah.
So, you slept with
both those girls, man.
How did you do that?
How did I do that?
There's this...
Girls like famous guys.
It's a story for them,
I guess. I don't know.
I take advantage
of it, though.
Believe me, they always
leave disappointed.
That's amazing.
Yeah, yeah, so let me hear
about this name, Ira Wright.
That's not your
real name, right?
How could you tell?
You're hiding some Judaism.
No, my real
last name is Wiener.
It's Ira Wiener
and everyone...
It's spelled the same
as "wiener" and I just got
tired of correcting people.
So, that's what led you
to the path of comedy.
Being humiliated every day.
First day of school,
"Is Ira Wiener here?"
And you were in the back.
"Wiener. My name's Wiener."
You little fruit.
What were your parents like?
What are the older
"Wieners" or Wieners like?
My parents are divorced.
They hate each other.
My mother thinks
my father's the devil.
I don't know
what that makes me,
technically, but...
So, you'll never
be as funny as me.
Why not?
Your generation
has the divorces,
which is cute-funny,
but my generation has the,
"Oh, my God, my father's
about to hit me with a bat!"
I just... You gotta break out
the funny a lot quicker than
your little faggy childhood.
Are you serious?
I spent my whole
childhood trying
to make my father laugh.
I still haven't succeeded,
but we'll get there.
Don't bail on me yet.
Keep it coming.
When's the first time
you fingered a girl?
I was at summer camp,
Jewish summer camp,
on the sports field.
And her name
was Sharon Mizrahi.
I didn't know what to do.
I got really scared.
She reached down
and grabbed my penis
really hard,
like she was just
trying to murder it.
Morning.
Yeah, baby.
It took me three hours,
but I think
I found your kitchen.
Am I in the
bathroom still?
Is that it?
No, no.
You're good.
You're safe.
What do you
got there?
This is medicine, Ira.
I'm sick.
One of those girls
have chlamydia?
I thought she smelled funny.
Is that what it is?
Yeah.
I have a weird blood disease.
AML. It's a form of leukemia.
This is experimental
medicine from Canada.
There's an 8% chance
of it working. So, fuck me.
Well, that's not true
'cause if it was,
I would've read about it
or heard about that.
You didn't hear
about it because
I didn't fucking
run out and tell
Well, why would
you tell me?
'Cause I don't
really know you, Ira.
I think you're not gonna
get too weird about this.
I don't want to start
getting treated like
the guy who's gonna die.
So, anyways, this shit's
got a lot of caffeine in it.
They say that's good for you.
Let me take the medicine.
Why are you telling
me this, George?
'Cause I want you
to possibly do me a favor.
Okay. Yeah. What?
Kill me.
What?
Nobody knows
we know each other.
You're a stranger.
You can get away with this.
I got a gun
in the other room.
It's untraceable.
I'll give you $50,000.
Don't make me suffer.
Please, kill me, Ira.
I'm begging you.
Can you at least
give me, like, a night
to think about it?
Ha!
Think about it?
You would do it!
Oh, I hate you, man.
Oh, no!
Ira, I misread you.
You're sick!
You're a murderer!
Screw you, man.
You wanted to do it!
What would you have
done for $100,000?
Chop my head off?
You would still
want to do it!
That wasn't even
good acting over there!
What the fuck?
That was good acting.
Daniel Day-Lewis would've
crushed that speech.
I bought that, man. Wow!
Ira, you don't have
to kill me,
but I am gonna die.
George, look.
Honestly, I'm like...
Don't get close, Ira.
...a really gullible guy.
Don't do this.
Look, my friends,
they trick me
all the time.
One of my roommates told me
he was Joe Pesci's son.
I believed him
for three years.
I still get shit for it,
so just, please,
level with me, man.
Are you serious?
I am serious, Ira.
Don't tell anybody
about this though,
all right?
I want it to be
our secret.
Now, you're gonna
make me some eggs.
Okay, murderer?
Don't say that.
Just try not to kill
any of the staff
while I'm gone, okay?
They have families.
IRA: Well, he actually
tricked me first,
but then he showed...
I mean,
he's taking medicine.
He's getting this
special medicine
from Canada.
MARK: Oh, my God,
that's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.
Yeah. I think I'm the
only person he's told.
That's what he said.
I mean, he's really...
He likes me, in a weird...
I think he's, like,
taken a shine to me,
you know.
Not enough to let you in
on that two-on-one.
Come on, that's
not appropriate.
I don't want
that anyway.
IRA: I just don't know.
I mean, it's...
It's really scary.
I've never even...
I don't think
I've known anyone
who's, like, sick,
you know, in like
a major way before.
I don't... I just...
LEO: George Simmons.
He's been around
my whole life.
It's like Snap, Crackle
and Pop dying, you know?
IRA: I know.
Can we not talk
about this right now?
I'm not really good
with the whole death thing.
Is that all right?
I need to talk about it, man.
I work for this guy now.
I can't...
I mean, that's all I'm...
It's all I'm thinking about.
I'm gonna tell you
this story that makes me
feel all right with death.
When I was younger,
my grandfather died
and we were all
gathered around him
and there was
this one candle
next to his bed.
And right after he died,
the candle started flickering
and then it just went out.
Wow.
Yeah.
And we looked around,
and there were no windows.
Like, nothing
in that room.
And it sounds crazy,
but we all thought
it was him going
to heaven, you know?
You don't pass through
fire to get to heaven.
I think he went to hell.
What'd you just say?
LEO: I just...
I think your grandfather
probably went to hell.
Don't do it.
Are you kidding
me right now?
I'm... I'm sorry
to break it to you.
You're gonna make
fun of me right now,
just after I opened up
to you guys like that?
It's not my fault
your grandfather's
in hell.
It's not a big deal.
Some grandpas go to hell.
Come on.
Don't be a jerk to me
just because I make
more money than you guys.
How much do you make again?
You guys are just projecting
all your hatred onto me.
Okay, and don't be
super bummed out
'cause your grandfather's
playing backgammon
with Hitler right now.
Shit, dude, don't.
GEORGE: I gotta get
rid of this stuff.
Man, I don't know what
I'm gonna do with it.
The more money you make,
the more free shit
they give you.
It makes no sense.
I don't see any jet skiing
in my near future.
All this shit was free?
You want a TV, Ira?
I got, like, three
flat screens laying
around in there somewhere.
Sure, I can... Yeah,
I can just take this stuff
to Goodwill if you want or...
You know what?
Don't even worry
about this stuff. Let's...
I got some cars in storage
you could sell for me
and just give
that money to charity.
I can do that, yeah.
I'm gonna write
a list out for you,
give you a bunch
of things
I want you to do.
What size sneaker are you?
Eleven and a half.
You got that
thick cock, don't you?
I want to see that thing.
Come on, pull the cock out.
I'm not gonna
show it to you.
What the fuck's
the matter with you?
I'm not gonna do
anything with it.
I just want to know
what I'm dealing with.
If you give me an iPod.
You asshole.
All right, you can
have anything in here,
but you gotta take
the  poster.
No, I want...
I love
I knew you loved
You and
five-year-olds
love
It's a smart movie.
So, which, specifically,
of the cars belong
to George Simmons?
Which one?
Yeah.
All of them.
All of them?
Yeah.
Well...
How would I go
about selling?
Selling them?
Yeah.
Well, I don't know about
selling them but I can
make a few disappear.
You know what I'm saying?
I don't want
to do that.
I don't want
to do that, either.
Just kidding.
DIRECTOR: Scene D is up!
Let's go on a bell.
And action!
All right now...
Bradford!
Yeah?
What is this?
Bo's English test.
Well, there's
a mistake.
Well, yeah, there
are lots of mistakes.
That's why
there's an F on it.
PRINCIPAL: You know, if Bo
doesn't pass, he can't play
in the big game Friday.
Shit.
I can't be
a part of this.
I'm not...
Yeah. I'm gonna go.
This is just so painful,
though, isn't it?
Yes, I want to kill myself.
So, where are you from,
originally?
You just moved here, right?
Yep. Delaware.
Delaware! Our first
state in the Union.
Yes, it is.
That's great.
No sales tax
in Delaware, right?
Yeah, there's not.
That's weird.
You know so much
about Delaware.
You fucking Joe Biden?
He's from Delaware.
See? I knew that.
Do you like music?
Did you just ask me
if I liked music?
Yeah. That... I'm...
I'm aware that
that's a weird question.
It's like asking me
if I like food.
That was my next question.
Yes.
Good.
Wilco. Do you like Wilco?
Wilco's playing
at the Greek Theatre.
And I was just
wondering if you maybe
wanted to go with me.
Yeah. I'll go. I'd be
into that. I like Wilco.
Great.
Okay, great, great.
So, I guess we will go
to the show together.
Not anymore.
You serious?
No, I'll go.
Oh, okay. Thank you.
Just don't say
that ever again.
Okay. I won't.
Whatever.
You got any jokes
for me, dum-dum?
Got some good ones,
I think, actually.
I have a thing
about how, like,
you're rich, you know,
and so you bought
a private jet,
but you're
afraid of flying,
so you just
drive in it.
Oh, that's funny.
You just go to
drive-throughs
and car washes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll come up with the ending,
but that was good.
I thought it could
be funny about your balls,
you know, about how, like,
you're getting older
and you found the first
gray hair on your balls.
And it really worried you,
but then you realized
it was good
'cause it made
your balls look
distinguished and smart.
Like, if you gave your balls
a little tweed jacket with
elbow pads and a little pipe,
your balls could be like
a character Kevin Kline
would play in a movie.
Yeah, that's funny,
that's funny.
I could do that.
What else you got?
Actually, this just
kind of happened.
I'm making you
an iTunes playlist.
For what?
Sometimes,
when I'm upset,
music makes me
feel a little better,
so I thought maybe...
Oh, it's
a cheer-me-up thing?
I was gonna just
put it on your iPod.
I don't have to
play it right now.
For what?
For when I go out jogging?
I don't need to...
Let me hear it.
I don't jog anymore.
Let me hear my playlist.
Ira! Ira!
Okay, you don't have
to make fun of it.
No, Bob Marley!
Yes. Everything
is gonna be all right.
You're right, Ira.
Bob Marley had cancer.
Everything wasn't
all right for Bob Marley.
He dead now.
What else
you put on there for me?
I really don't want
to do this, George.
Can we just... I'll...
Just forget I did this.
Ignore it.
I'll erase it, okay?
No, no, no, don't do that.
Let's hear what's gonna
cheer me up! This is good.
Come on. What else you got?
Okay, here's
the next one.
I don't know what
to say to that one.
That's... That's just...
That's just fifth grade and...
Showing me your cock
was embarrassing,
but this is okay?
Oh, God.
That's a good song.
Yeah, what else?
Give me more. This is...
This is unbelievable.
You sure you want
to hear another one?
I don't...
Yeah! Yeah, yeah.
This is fun
to be cheered up.
I'm sorry...
Just write me some jokes,
you stupid, fucking idiot.
Okay, I'm sorry.
she's my best friend. "
This could be funny.
Like, your dad didn't
like you, so he named
you and your dog George.
"George, I... Look at this
awesome book I just got!"
And then you
come in, it's like,
"Not you, the dog."
That's funny.
Yeah.
a nice steak for you. "
Come lick it up. You. "
here to do what you do. "
and all your whores. "
Hey, can you help me with
some of my jokes when I...
When I drop you off later?
Help you with
some of your bits?
Yeah.
No. I'm not gonna
help you, man.
No one helped me
when I started.
Fucking,
I'm not paying to help you,
I'm paying you to help me.
No, okay.
You're right,
you're right.
Drop it like it's hot. "
Can I ask you
something?
Is your act just designed
to make sure no girl will
ever sleep with you again?
All you fucking talk about
is jacking off and farting.
You think a girl's
gonna come up
to you after the show,
"Could you just
jack off for me
and then fart in my face?"
It's fucking insane!
Do you want
to get laid, ever?
What are you doing here?
What's happening?
I couldn't sleep.
I want to get
the Cavaliers game.
I can't get this
thing ever to work.
I was up all night, man.
I had a terrible sleep.
I was sweating my ass off.
I'm fucking hot one second
and cold one second
and the
don't work for shit.
It's always going
up to the roof.
What time is it?
It says 3:00.
It's 3:00? God damn it!
I can't fucking waste time.
I gotta...
All right,
let's start my goddamn day.
I don't got time
for this shit.
Let me have that
stupid clicker. Come on.
They keep telling me that
I gotta dial an extension.
I don't even have
the fucking number to dial
for the fucking extension!
Do you want me
to try calling them?
You should have
fucking called them!
Where the fuck
were you last night?
You'll call them.
I'm sorry, man.
Just tell me what you need,
I'll get it done, okay?
You pay for all of this stuff
and none of it ever works!
Nothing!
I don't even
think I'm sick!
These guys are trying
to fucking kill me!
I want to go to the doctor.
I gotta see this guy.
What the fuck is happening?
This medicine does not work.
It makes it worse!
Okay. I'll call them
right now. I'll tell
them we're coming, okay?
Now. We gotta go now.
I'll call them
right now, okay?
Yeah.
I'll meet you downstairs.
Please put away
the video game.
Don't do that. Don't be rude.
I'm sorry.
Fucking playing
What the fuck
were you playing?
Just a driving game.
Hello, Mr. Simmons.
Hey, yeah, Doctor,
good to see you.
How are you?
I brought my friend.
This is my...
Well, my lover, my life
partner, my everything.
How are you?
What's going on?
How we doing?
Well, your immune system
is in the middle of
a very serious battle.
The medicine is trying
to combat the disease,
but in the process
it destroys healthy tissue
and disrupts healthy
functioning of your organs
and multiple
lymphatic systems,
so you're getting
attacked on two levels.
And we hope the disease
is vanquished
before it and the medicine
does damage
which cannot be contained.
Okay.
Your accent
is very thick.
You ever notice
your accent
makes things sound
worse than they...
Than they actually are?
You could give good news,
and I'd still be like,
"What happened?
Am I still dying?"
I'm just trying
to help you.
I know you sound
like a regular Joe
where you come from,
but here I keep thinking
you're gonna be torturing
James Bond later.
I'm sure your sense of humor
will serve you well
in this situation.
There he goes again.
All so terrifying because
it came out of your mouth.
You are a very funny man.
Are you mad that you died
at the end of
I don't understand
the reference.
He kind of looks
like those two guys
in the second  movie.
I assure you I was
not in
Why did you eat Björn Borg?
What did he do to you?
If you have
no other questions,
I do have other patients.
You have other patients
that you have to frighten
by the end of the day?
How many patients
do you frighten a day?
And I am slowly getting
a little bit annoyed
by these humorous
activities from you guys.
So, I think you and...
We have discussed
this and I am very,
very sympathetic
to your recovery,
and I hope we will succeed
with what we are doing.
I've been trying
to build this cabinet
I bought from you guys
for, like, six months
and I gotta...
IKEA? That's very funny.
Hey. Yo, Teach.
Hey.
How's... How was the taping?
Great. Great, yeah.
I'm happy with it.
I think the ending
really murdered.
Was it a very
special episode?
You remember
Daisy, right?
Yeah, of course.
Hey.
MARK: I'm sorry.
I didn't know you'd
be coming home tonight.
I thought maybe you'd
be spending the night
at George's and...
Guess it's been
more than 10 days, huh?
Yeah,
I gave you an extra 11.
What are you guys
talking about?
Nothing.
Doesn't matter.
It's cool.
Don't give a shit.
Totally fine.
Hey. I saw the new
movie.
Harry's getting old.
He's, like,
older than my dad.
They should call
him Harold Potter.
That Hermione's got
some big, old titties.
Whoa!
Did you two just bone?
I'm getting a little
vibe here.
This is exciting.
Think I'm getting
a quarter chub.
Why is Ira so upset?
It's been, like,
way after 10 days.
He can't call dibs
on every girl he meets.
We were supposed to go out
on a date together.
We are going
out on a date.
I thought so.
We're not anymore! No!
Really?
'Cause after you
fuck my roommate
that kind of ends it with me!
What are you talking about?
Don't treat me like that.
Just so you know
how I'm seeing you?
You're a starfucker.
You're a girl who met
a star and then fucked him.
And he's not even
that famous!
What if like a real
good-looking celebrity
was my roommate?
What if I lived with,
you know, James McAvoy
or Jude Law or something?
I don't know.
I probably would fuck
both of those people.
Don't say that.
I'm sorry!
Lower the bar
a little bit.
I can't believe that!
If a hot girl walked over
here, naked, and was like,
"Do my body," you would.
You would have
sex with her.
No, I'd feel
really uncomfortable.
And then I might ask
her to a Wilco show.
Okay, then you're the first
guy in the world that I've
ever met that's like that.
I thought you were
the kind of girl
that would wait two months
and then have
sex with a guy.
I didn't think
you would just...
I'm an independent woman.
I'm allowed
to fuck people.
Well, if I had known that,
I would have scheduled
our date a lot sooner!
Give me a break.
I don't even know you.
This is the longest
conversation
we've ever had.
Don't be mad at me.
I said I'd give
you 10 days.
I gave you three weeks.
I thought you
were joking, man.
I'm gonna be
honest with you.
We... We... We want to fuck
every girl that we meet.
That's how it works.
If I didn't sleep with
every girl you wished
you could sleep with,
I wouldn't sleep
with anybody.
It's a communication
breakdown.
We can fix this.
I don't care.
The fact that you
had sex with her...
I can never do anything
like that with her.
So, you're really not
gonna chase this girl
just because I was with her?
Yeah.
Huh.
It's kind of insulting,
on some level.
Wanna go to Wilco with me?
I wish I could,
but I'm going
with Tobey Maguire.
I might play
his little brother
in this movie.
I hope I get it.
GEORGE: Give me something.
You didn't get rid of them.
What did you get rid of?
IRA: Well, I, you know,
I got a few good offers,
but honestly, I don't
know how much each car
is worth and I...
They keep on wanting
to buy all of them
and it's hard for me to...
Don't make it a big deal.
Don't get
a stomach-ache over it.
Just sell them.
Give it to a charity.
Move on.
Okay.
I just want to be
happy about
giving something
away, you know.
Okay.
So...
There's something
I've really been wanting
to tell you, George.
Uh-oh.
Yeah.
I feel as though you need
to tell someone other than me
about your condition.
I don't want to do that.
George,
people care about you.
You have to let them
be there for you.
I tell somebody,
then it's all gonna change,
and you can't get it back.
Everything's
already changed, George,
and the truth is
soon you're gonna
start getting very sick
and you are gonna want
someone other than me there.
I mean, have you...
Have you even told
your parents yet?
My parents are
in their mid-70s.
They would drop dead
if they heard about this.
Friends. You must want
to tell your friends.
I don't really
have any friends.
I have people
I shoot the shit with
and fuck around with,
but there's nobody
I'm really close with.
I've got showbiz friends.
Andy Dick isn't a friend.
He's just a guy you know.
You're my closest friend,
and I don't even like you.
You have to tell
someone other than me, man.
I can't be
the only one who knows.
I've never dealt
with anything like this.
All my grandparents
are alive.
Listen,
this is not your job to cry.
Your job is to not cry.
I'm just trying
to talk to you
man-to-man, George.
As a man, you are
crying right now.
I'm not crying.
People are gonna think
we just broke up
or something, Ira.
Stop doing what
you're doing.
Okay, I'll stop.
You're causing a scene.
You're making
crazy faces now, Ira.
Open your eyes.
Stop crying.
You're making noises now?
You look like
the Incredible Hulk.
Jesus,
you're spitting
on my shrimp,
you asshole.
I'm sorry.
God, I'm sorry.
Come on.
Wipe it off.
Jesus Christ.
I'm sorry, I just don't know.
This is the worst.
Why didn't I just get hit
by a fucking foul ball?
You ruined The Palm,
you fucking ass.
This could have been
the best meal, ever.
Should I get you
ice chips or something?
No, I'm good.
You never had any kids, huh?
No. No.
We didn't get to that.
I have three.
I know.
Three kids to carry
on the Dick legacy.
How the hell did you have
any kids with all
the penises you've blown?
I sucked my own dick
and spit it
into their vagina.
I mean, knowing that.
Most people just go
through life asleep anyways.
Some of those people
don't even wake up
until they get, you know,
the Dr. Death call,
you know.
"This is Dr. Death!
You're going to die."
"Don't
be afraid, George.
"It's just Death calling.
Cheer up, motherfucker!"
Yeah.
Fuck negativity.
Fuck it in the ass
with a Chinese monkey!
I wish I wasn't
so fucking angry
with you right now.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I wasn't
a good brother.
You were
a terrible brother.
You just left us
and you didn't care.
You didn't give
a shit about us.
You don't even give a...
You moved to Kansas.
Am I supposed
to visit you in Kansas?
Yes.
I thought that's
why you moved there,
so you didn't get visitors.
You're so fucking selfish.
I know.
You've only seen my son,
like, three times.
I send him fucking
DVDs all the time.
He doesn't want your DVDs.
He wants you to be
a part of his life.
He wants to be
a part of yours.
Wow. This has been great.
I want to call Dad now
and just have
more family time.
What did we
ever do to you?
I'm not Dad.
You are right.
You're very, very nice,
and I'm sorry
I don't know your son.
I'm sorry I don't
know you anymore.
I'm glad you
don't know me.
I wish I did.
You'd be let down,
believe me.
Oh, man.
Oh, God.
Who's that?
That's the girl
I was gonna marry...
...but then she
smartened up.
So, she's 10
and she's six.
GEORGE: So cute.
Jeez, she looks like you,
the little one, huh?
Yeah.
What's the matter?
Your guy doesn't
have any DNA in him?
That's all Laura.
They fight a lot,
but they're cute.
Yeah.
Thank you so much
for coming here.
I wanted to come.
I wanted to see you.
You didn't have
to come here.
You didn't have to.
I know it's
stressful for you.
I'm just...
I'm just...
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry about
everything I did.
You don't have to be sorry.
That was 12 years ago.
Everything worked out
for the best.
It's good.
Look at your life.
This is great.
Yes. It's the best life.
I hate it. I hate it all.
I haven't been...
You don't hate it.
I'm addicted to it, I guess.
I keep doing it.
Hello, Wayne. This is Ira.
I'm calling to say
I don't think today
is a good day for you
to come by and see George.
Maybe tomorrow. So, I'll give
you a call when I know
what the schedule looks like.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you soon.
You have a family now.
You have a family now.
I'm so happy.
You did the right thing.
You moved on.
You got a good life.
And... And I just
got nothing, Laura.
I hate that.
I hate that it could
have been me with you.
Don't do that, please?
I'm sorry. I just fucking...
You... I could have
had those kids with you.
How could you cheat on me?
I was so hot.
You were.
You were so hot.
I don't know.
I was hot!
I don't even know what
the fuck I was doing.
I was just a stupid idiot.
I don't remember anybody else.
What was wrong with you?
I don't remember
anybody else.
I only remember you.
I don't know.
I don't even know
who they were,
who fucking ruined us.
They're not in
my brain, ever.
It's like it didn't happen.
The only thing
that happened was us.
And you ran away
'cause you had to.
I had to go.
At the time, I just
couldn't do it anymore.
Yeah.
But you know
what I realized?
I love my husband,
but it's just not the same.
And I loved you
so much and...
I know, I know,
I know, I know.
I have the same thing.
I have the same thing.
Don't feel bad.
Don't feel bad.
I love you. I love you.
I always loved you.
And the crazy thing is
he cheats on me, too.
I hate...
He's like an Australian you.
I fucking hate this guy.
Is he crazy?
It's just that
you were the one.
Just you are...
Were... Are the love...
Love of my life.
And I just love you.
Yeah, the hug
was a mistake,
wasn't it?
You're not sick, are you?
You're just doing that
to get me down here, huh?
There are those
hands again.
My big hands.
Always made
my penis look small.
Thank you, hands,
for that complex.
Yes. Jeez.
The two of them together,
it was a guaranteed dwarfing.
Okay.
Yeah.
That was worth it.
Diego.
Yes, George?
The roses
look terrific.
Thank you.
They sure
look beautiful.
Only a guy with a big cock
like you could make roses
this beautiful.
You doing stand-up at all?
This is actually
the first time I've left
the house in three years.
But I will sometimes,
in my house,
in front of my kids,
I'll do five, six minutes.
Not good stuff.
It's a lot of "Where
you from?" You know.
But, you know,
all kidding aside,
I know you're
in a terrible
situation,
but even with that,
you look so much
better than him.
We watched your
last movie on video.
A man who is funny
doesn't have to work blue.
You don't...
You don't have to do
trash to be funny.
I'll tell you who was
a great comedian.
Please say me. Who?
Jackie Gleason.
Yeah, of course.
You like him
'cause you look
like Art Carney.
Gleason was terrific.
And you ain't so bad.
All right.
Thank you, Pop.
I know.
I think I played it
all wrong, Ira.
I played it all wrong.
Okay. He's here.
We saw each other.
Let me answer it. Mark.
Stop.
Let me answer it.
Mark, man.
Move, bitch!
Hey, George Simmons. Hey.
Hey, what's up?
Happy Thanksgiving.
Hey!
Mark.
Leo is the name I got.
How are you?
Yeah, yeah.
That's right!
Yeah, right.
Oh, boy.
That movie's the best
'cause you're a man
then you're a baby
and then you learn
to be a man once
you be... You need...
It takes becoming a baby
to learn how to become a man.
Yeah. Can we get you
a drink or some food?
No, no, no.
Let me just walk around
and go through your shit.
Hey, I'm Bo.
What's up, Bo?
I'm an actor, so...
Oh, good, good, good,
good, good, good.
GEORGE: I've seen
your act a lot.
Really? Where?
Schmira, he has that...
What's that, the YouTubey
thing that, that...
DAISY: The YouTube.
GEORGE: Yeah.
George and Daisy are here?
How the hell did that happen?
I didn't think
George would come,
and who invited Daisy?
I invited her.
Are you still
sleeping with Daisy?
No, I'm not
sleeping with Daisy!
I have a new girlfriend now.
I'm dating the girl
who plays Mrs. Pruitt.
Her name's
Carla something.
Can I sit next to
George at dinner?
Sit wherever the hell
you want to sit, man, why?
I feel like if I can just
make George crack up once,
it'll do huge things
for me, like...
What, you wrote
jokes for Thanksgiving?
I didn't write jokes.
I just wrote down
my funniest anecdotes
and punched them up
here and there.
Okay,
I can't hide in the kitchen
all afternoon. I'm going.
My man. The Schmira.
Thanks for coming, man.
This is the best.
Where's your bedroom?
Well, get ready for a hike,
'cause you're standing in it.
No.
It's...
Yeah, it's pretty lame.
Did you go to
that Wilco show?
Yeah, did you?
No, actually, I didn't.
I scalped the tickets.
I made 100 bucks
profit, so...
Oh. So, you
owe me 50.
Okay, I guess I do.
Rain check, okay?
Money order.
Money order?
That'll work.
Yeah.
PayPal? Are you on PayPal?
Yeah, PayPal it up.
Look at that,
back and forth,
like a cute couple.
You're like
Marc Anthony
and J. Lo.
You know, we actually
had a date, but then
I had sex with that guy,
so Schmira broke it off.
GEORGE: You kidding me?
Don't worry, Ira. You know
you're a better lover
than Pete Rose over there.
Look at him. He's got
the length and the width.
Imagine that dong of his.
I saw the tip of it one time.
Even that was too big for me.
No, it's very normal.
Yeah.
So, you like big penises?
Well, you know,
I have a really
skinny vagina, so...
If it's skinny,
you should try
feeding it carbs.
Yeah.
All right, well,
jeez, you know what?
I'm gonna leave
you two alone, huh?
Yeah, okay.
I'm falling in love
with the both of you.
Let the awkwardness begin!
MAN: Love your work.
GEORGE: Yeah? Thank you
for shopping at Ralphs.
I'm sorry.
I owe you an apology.
It's really weird what I did.
I basically yelled at you for
cheating on me before we had
even had a real conversation.
So, I'm aware of that.
I know that's weird,
and I'm sorry.
Well, it's not as weird
as getting drunk
and having sex with the guy
from  So...
It's okay.
When I first moved here,
I blew Mr. Belvedere.
So, everyone does that.
