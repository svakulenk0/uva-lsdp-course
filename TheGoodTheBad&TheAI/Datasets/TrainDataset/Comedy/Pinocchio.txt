Pretty, huh?
I'll bet a lot of you folks
don't believe that...
about a wish coming true...
do you?
Well, I didn't, either.
Of course, I'm just a cricket
singing my way
from hearth to hearth,
but... let me tell you
what made me change my mind.
One night a long time...
Pardon me.
Wait till
I fix this thing here.
There.
One night a long time ago,
my travels took me
to a quaint little village.
It was a beautiful night.
The stars were shining
like diamonds
high above the roofs
of that sleepy old town.
Pretty as a picture.
As I wandered along
the crooked streets,
there wasn't a soul to be seen.
The only sign of life was
a lighted window
in the shop of a woodcarver
named Geppetto.
So... I hopped over...
...and looked in.
It was a shame to see a nice,
cheerful fire like that
goin' to waste.
So what do I do?
I go in.
I looked around.
Of course, being
in a strange place like that,
I didn't know what to expect.
A cricket can't be too careful,
you know.
Soon as I saw
there was no one about,
I made myself at home.
As I stood there warming my...
myself,
I took a look around.
Well, sir, you never saw
such a place...
the most fantastic clocks
you ever laid your eyes on,
and all carved out of wood.
And cute, little music boxes...
each one a work of art.
And shelf after shelf of toys
and...
and then something else
caught my eye...
a puppet.
You know... one of those
marionette things.
All strings and joints.
Cute little fella.
Goin' up!
Good piece of wood, too.
Well, now.
It won't take much longer.
Just a little more paint,
and he's all finished.
I think he'll be all right,
don't you, Figaro?
Beg pardon.
See?
That makes a big difference.
Very good.
Very, very...
Well, you can't please
everybody.
Now I have just the name
for you... Pinocchio.
Do you like it, Figaro?
No?
You do, don't you, Cleo?
Well, we'll leave it
to little wooden head.
Do you like it?
That settles it!
Pinocchio it is!
Come on, now!
We'll try you out.
Music, professor!
Take it easy, there!
Break it up, will ya?
Lot of downbeats in there.
How graceful!
Cleo, meet Pinocchio.
Say, "How do you do?"
Say hello to Figaro.
Up to mischief already!
You see what happens?
Up we go!
You're a cute little fellow.
And that smile...
You know, I...
You rascal.
Jealous, huh?
You know, Pinocchio,
I think Figaro is jealous
of you.
Oh-ho, don't worry, Figaro.
I wonder what time it is.
It's getting late.
Come now.
We go to bed.
Good night, Pinocchio.
Little funny face.
Good night, Cleo,
my little water baby.
You say good night, too.
Go on.
Now, go to sleep,
my little mermaid.
Good night.
This is my idea of comfort.
Silent comfort.
Look at him, Figaro.
He almost looks alive.
Wouldn't it be nice
if he was a real boy?
Oh, well.
Come on.
We go to sleep.
I forgot to open the window.
Oh, Figaro, look!
Look! A wishing star!
Starlight, star bright,
first star I see tonight...
I wish I may,
I wish I might
have the wish
I make tonight.
Figaro, you know what I wish?
I wish that my little Pinocchio
might be a real boy.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Just think!
A real boy!
A very lovely thought...
but not at all practical.
A real...
...boy.
Quiet!!
After all, enough's enough.
Now what's up?
Hey!
What's goin' on here?!
As I live and breathe...
a fairy!
Good Geppetto,
you have given so much happiness
to others.
You deserve to have
your wish come true.
Little puppet
made of pine...
wake.
The gift of life is thine.
What they can't do these days.
I can move!
I can talk!
I can walk!
Yes, Pinocchio.
I've given you life.
Why?
Because tonight Geppetto
wished for a real boy.
Am I a real boy?
No, Pinocchio.
To make Geppetto's wish
come true
will be entirely up to you.
Up to me?
Prove yourself brave,
truthful, and unselfish,
and someday you will be
a real boy.
A real boy!
That won't be easy.
You must learn to choose
between right and wrong.
Right and wrong?
But how will I know?
How will he know?
Your conscience
will tell you.
What are conscience?
What are conscience?
Well, I'll tell ya!
A conscience is that still,
small voice
that people won't listen to.
That's just the trouble
with the world today.
Are you my conscience?
Who, me?
Would you like to be
Pinocchio's conscience?
Well... I...
Very well.
What is your name?
Cricket's the name.
Jiminy Cricket.
Kneel, Mr. Cricket.
No tricks, now.
I dub you
Pinocchio's conscience,
Lord High Keeper of the
knowledge of right and wrong,
counselor in moments
of temptation,
and guide along
the straight and narrow path.
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.
Well! My, my!
Say, that's pretty swell!
Gee, thanks.
But don't I get
a badge or somethin'?
Well, we'll see.
You mean maybe I will?
I shouldn't wonder.
Make it a gold one?
Maybe.
Now, remember, Pinocchio,
be a good boy.
And always let your
conscience be your guide.
Goodbye, milady.
Goodbye!
Not bad, says I.
Oh, yeah.
Almost forgot about you.
Well, Pinoke...
Maybe you and I had better have
a little heart-to-heart talk.
Why?
Well, you want to be
a real boy, don't you?
All right.
Sit down, son.
Now, you see, the world
is full of temptations.
Temptations?
Yep... temptations.
They're the wrong things
that seem right at the time.
But even though
the right things
may seem wrong sometimes,
sometimes the wrong things
may be right
at the wrong time
or vice versa.
Understand?
But I'm gonna do right!
Attaboy, Pinoke.
And I'm gonna help you.
And anytime you need me,
you know, just whistle,
like this...
Like this?
No, no.
Try it again, Pinoke.
Like this?
No, son.
Now, listen.
That's it!
Come on, now!
Let's sing it!
Right!
Look out, Pinoke!
Who's there?!
It's me!
Oh. It's me.
There's somebody in here!
Carefully, now, Figaro.
He might spring out on us
at any time.
He's in here somewhere.
Here I am!
How did you get down here?
I fell down.
Oh, you did, hmm?
You are talking!
No!
Yes!
And I can move, too!
No, no, no! You can't!
I'm dreaming in my sleep!
Wake me up! Wake me up!
Now we see who's dreaming.
Go on... say something.
Gee, you're funny.
Do it again!
You do talk!
Yes!
The Blue Fairy came...
The Blue Fairy?
- And I got a conscience!
- A conscience?
And someday,
I'm gonna be a real boy!
A real boy!
It's my wish!
It's come true!
Figaro, look!
He's alive! He can talk!
Say hello to Figaro.
Hello to Figaro.
I almost forgot!
Look! It's Pinocchio!
She's my little water baby.
Isn't she cute?
Yeah. Cute.
This calls for a celebration!
Music!
You start one, Pinocchio!
Oh, boy! A party!
Mind if I cut in?
How 'bout sittin' out
the next one, babe, huh?
Let me out!
Let me out!
Come, Cleo!
It's time to party! Dance!
Nice!
Look! Pretty!
Where's a bucket?!
Get water!
Where's a bucket?
Here it is! I got it!
Here's water!
Here's some water!
Help! Where's water?
That was close.
Maybe we'd better go to bed
before something else happens.
Little man,
you've had a busy night.
Now close your eyes
and go to sleep.
Why?
Oh, everybody has to sleep.
Figaro goes to sleep,
and Cleo and...
and besides, tomorrow
you've got to go to school.
Why?
Oh, to learn things and...
and get smart.
Why?
Because.
Oh, look, Father!
Look!
Now, wait.
Stand still, now.
What are those?
Huh? Oh, those.
They are your schoolmates...
girls and boys.
- Now, get into this.
- Real boys?
Yes.
But hurry, now.
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait.
Here's an apple
for your teacher.
Now, turn around
and let me look you over.
Oh, yeah! Yes!
Here.
Run along, now.
Wait, wait!
Come back here, Figaro.
School is not for you.
Goodbye, Father!
Goodbye, son!
Hurry back!
Ah, Gideon, listen...
the merry laughter
of little, innocent children
wending their way to school.
Thirsty little minds rushing
to the fountain of knowledge.
School...
a noble institution.
What would this
stupid world be without...
Well, well, well!
So that old rascal's
back in town, eh?
Remember, Giddy, the time
I tied strings on you
and passed you off
as a puppet?
We nearly put one over
on that old gypsy that time.
A little wooden boy.
Now, who...
A wooden boy!
Look, Giddy. Look.
It's amazing!
A live puppet without strings.
A thing like that ought to be
worth a fortune to someone.
Now, let me see...
That's it... Stromboli!
Why, that fat, old faker
would give his...
Listen!
If we play our cards right,
we'll be on Easy Street,
or my name
isn't Honest John.
Quick!
We'll head him off.
Now's our...
No, no, stupid.
Don't be crude.
Let me handle this.
Here he comes.
Ah, yes, Giddy,
as I was saying to
the duchess only yesterday...
Oh, how clumsy of me!
Oh, how clumsy of me!
Oh, my, my, my, my.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, I do hope
you're not injured.
I'm all right.
Oh, splendid.
Well, well.
Quite the scholar, I see.
Look, Giddy.
A man of letters.
Here's your book.
I'm going to school.
School. Ah, yes.
Then you haven't heard
of the easy road to success.
No?
I'm speaking, my boy,
of the theater!
Here's your apple.
Bright lights! Music!
Applause!
Fame!
- Fame?
- Yes!
And with that personality,
that profile, that physique,
why, he's a natural-born
actor, eh, Giddy?
- And I'm going...
- Straight to the top.
Why, I can see your name
in lights...
lights six feet high...
what is your name?
P-l-N...
U-O...
P-I...
We're wasting precious time.
Come. On to the theater!
Fine conscience
I turned out to be.
Late the first day.
Oh, well.
He can't get in much trouble
between here and school.
Oh, boy! A parade!
Why, it's Pinoke!
- Hey! Where you goin'?
-
Halt!
-
- Hold on, there! Pinoke!
What was that?
Oh, it's Jiminy!
What you doin' up there?
Who? What? What?
Who? Up where?
Why, my boy, you must be
seeing things.
Oh, no.
That's my conscience.
Now, now, now.
Just calm down.
Why, there's nothing up there
to be afraid of.
Over here.
Over here.
I'm gonna be an actor!
All right, son.
Take it easy, now.
Remember what I said
about temptation?
Well, that's him.
Oh, no, Jiminy!
That's Mr. Honest John.
Honest John?
Get me outta here!
Get me outta here!
All right, then.
Here's what we'll tell 'em...
you can't go to the theater.
Say thank you just the same.
You're sorry, but you've
got to go to school.
Here they come, Pinoke.
Now, you tell 'em.
Oh, little boy...
Ah, there you are!
Oh, where were we?
Ah, yes.
On to the theater!
Goodbye, Jiminy! Goodbye!
Goodbye? Huh?!
-
- Goodbye?!
Hey, Pinoke!
You can't...
There he goes.
Oh, what'll I do?
I'll run and tell his father.
No. That would be snitchy.
I'll go after him myself.
Ladies and gentlemen,
to conclude the performance
of this great show,
Stromboli the Master Showman...
that's me...
and by special permission
of the management...
that's me, too...
is presenting to you
something you will absolutely
refuse to believe.
Well, looks like a sellout.
Introducing...
the only marionette
who can sing and dance
absolutely without the aids
of strings!
The one-and-only Pinocchio!
What a buildup.
...
Go ahead.
Make a fool of yourself.
Then maybe you'll listen
to your conscience.
What I told you, huh?!
They like him.
He's a success.
Gosh, maybe I was wrong.
Well...
guess he won't need me anymore.
What does an actor want
with a conscience anyway?
What could have
happened to him?
Where could he be
at this hour?
I'd better go out again
and look for him.
And remember...
nobody eats a bite...
until I find him.
Bravo, Pinocchio!
They liked me.
You are sensational!
You mean I'm good?
You are colossal!
Does that mean I'm an actor?
Sure! I will push you
in the public's eye!
Your face... she will be
on everybody's tongue!
Will she?
Yeah.
What's this?!
For you,
my little Pinocchio.
For me? Gee, thanks!
I'll run right home
and tell my father.
Home?
Oh, sure!
Going home to your father!
Oh, that is very comical!
You mean it's funny?
Sure!
I'll be back in the morning.
Be back in the morning?!
Going home!
There!
This will be your home!
Where I can find you always.
No! No! No!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
To me... you are belonging.
We will tour the world.
Paris...
London...
Monte Carlo...
Constantinople!
No! No!
Yes!
We start tonight!
You will make lots of money...
for me!
And when you are growing
too old,
you will make good...
firewood!
Let me out of here!
I gotta get out!
You can't...
Quiet!
Shut up before
I knock you silly!
Good night...
my little wooden gold mine.
No! No, wait!
Let me out!
I'll tell my father!
Get along, then!
Ah, Jiminy, where are you?!
Well, there he goes...
sitting in the lap of luxury,
the world at his feet.
Oh, well, I can always say
I knew him when.
I'll just go
out of his life quietly.
I would like to wish him luck,
though.
Sure. Why not?
It's me... your old friend
Jiminy, remember?
Gee, I'm glad to see ya!
What's happened?!
What did he do to you?
Oh, he was mad!
He said he was gonna push
my face in everybody's eye!
And just 'cause
I'm a goldbrick,
he's gonna chop me
into firewood!
Oh, is that so?
Now, don't you worry, son.
I'll have you out of here
in no time at all.
Why, this is just as easy
as rolling off a...
Kinda rusty.
Needs a little oil.
Needs a little oil...
Well, that's what I said.
Must be one of the old models.
You mean you can't open it?
Yeah.
Looks pretty hopeless.
It'll take a miracle
to get us out of here.
A fine conscience
I turned out to be.
I should've
listened to you, Jiminy.
No. It was my fault.
I shouldn't have
walked out on you.
Guess I'll never see
my father again.
Oh, buck up, son.
It could be worse.
Be cheerful...
like me!
Take it easy, son.
Come on... blow.
Attaboy.
Oh, well...
It stopped raining, anyway.
Hey, that star again!
The lady!
The fairy!
What'll she say?
What'll I tell her?
Well, you might
tell her the truth.
Why, Pinocchio...
Hello.
Sir Jiminy...
Well, this is
a pleasant surprise.
Pinocchio, why didn't
you go to school?
School?
Well, I...
Go ahead. Tell her.
I was going to school
till I met somebody.
Met somebody?
Yeah.
Two big monsters...
with big, green eyes.
Why...
Monsters?
Weren't you afraid?
No, ma'am, but they tied me
in a big sack.
You don't say!
And where was Sir Jiminy?
Leave me out of this.
They put him in a little sack.
No!
Yeah!
- How did you escape?
- I didn't.
They chopped me into firewood!
Oh, look! My nose!
What's happened?
Perhaps you haven't been
telling the truth, Pinocchio.
- Perhaps?
- Oh, but I have.
Every single word!
Oh, please, help me.
I'm awful sorry.
You see, Pinocchio, a lie
keeps growing and growing
until it's as plain
as the nose on your face.
She's right, Pinoke.
You better come clean.
I'll never lie again...
honest, I won't.
Please, Your Honor...
I mean, Miss Fairy.
Give him another chance...
for my sake, will ya?
I'll forgive you this once,
but remember...
a boy who won't be good
might just as well
be made of wood.
We'll be good, won't we?
Very well. But this is
the last time I can help you.
Gee, look, Jiminy... my nose!
Hey, we're free!
Come on, Pinoke.
Goodbye, Mr...
Quiet!
Let's get out of here
before something else happens.
And the dummy fell for it.
Hook, line, and sinker!
And he still thinks
we're his friends.
And did Stromboli pay?
Plenty.
That shows you how low
Honest John will stoop...
Now, Coachman...
what's your proposition?
Well...
How would you blokes like
to make some real money?
Well!
And who do we have to...
No, no.
Nothing like that.
You see...
I'm collecting
stupid little boys.
Stupid little boys?
You know, the disobedient ones
who want to play hooky
from school.
And you see...
Yes.
And I takes 'em
to Pleasure Island.
Ah, Pleasure Island.
Pleasure Island?!
But the law!
Suppose they...
No, no.
There's no risk.
They never come back...
as boys!
Now... I've got a coach load
leaving at midnight.
We'll meet
at the crossroads...
and no double-crossing!
- No, sir.
- Scout around...
and any good prospects
you find, bring 'em to me.
- Yes, chief.
- I'll pay you well.
I got plenty of gold.
Yes, yes.
No, sir!
Nothing can stop me now!
I'll make good this time.
You'd better!
I will.
I'm going to school!
That's the stuff, Pinoke!
I'd rather be smart
than be an actor.
Now you're talkin'!
Come on, slow-poke.
I'll race you home!
Well, well.
What's your rush?
I gotta beat Jiminy home.
Oh, hello.
Well, how is the great actor?
I don't want to be an actor.
Stromboli was terrible.
- He was?
- Yeah.
He locked me in a birdcage.
He did?
And I learned my lesson.
I'm going...
Oh, you poor, poor boy.
You must be a nervous wreck.
That's it!
You are a nervous wreck!
We must diagnose this case
at once.
Quick, doctor, your notebook.
Bless my soul.
My, my.
Just as I thought.
A slight touch
of monetary complications
with bucolic semilunar
contraptions
of the flying trapezes.
Say "hippopotamus."
Hippopotamus.
I knew it!
Compound transmission
of the pandemonium
with percussion and spasmodic
frantic disintegration.
Close your eyes.
What do you see?
Nothing.
- Open 'em. Now what do you see?
- Spots.
Now, that heart.
Ooh, my goodness!
A palpating syncopation
of the killer diller
with a wicky-wacky stamping
of the boy-joy.
Quick, doctor, that report!
This makes it perfectly clear!
My boy,
you... are... allergic.
Allergic?
Yes, and there is
only one cure.
A vacation on Pleasure Island!
Pleasure Island?
Yes... that happy land
of carefree boys
where every day's a holiday!
But I can't go.
Why, of course you can go!
I'm giving you my ticket.
Here.
Thanks! But I'm...
I insist!
Your health comes first.
Come! The coach departs
at midnight!
Now, where do you suppose he...
Hey, come back!
Well...
here we go again.
My name's Lampwick.
What's yours?
You ever been
to Pleasure Island?
But Mr. Honest John gave me...
Me neither, but they say
it's a swell joint...
no school, no cops.
You can tear the joint apart
and nobody says a word.
Honest John gave me...
Loaf around, plenty to eat,
plenty to drink,
and it's all free.
Honest John...
Boy, that's the place.
I can hardly wait.
Right here, boys!
Right here!
Get your cake, pie,
dill pickles, and ice cream!
Eat all you can!
Be a glutton!
Stuff yourselves!
It's all free, boys!
It's all free!
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
The Rough House!
The Rough House!
It's the roughest, toughest
joint you ever seen!
Come in and pick a fight,
boys!
Oh, boy, a scrap!
Come on, let's go in and poke
somebody in the nose.
Why?
Aw, just for the fun of it.
Okay, Lampy.
Tobacco Row!
Tobacco Row!
Get your cigars, cigarettes,
and chewing tobacco!
Come in
and smoke your heads off!
There's nobody here
to stop you!
There's somethin'... phony
about all this.
I've gotta get him
outta here.
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry!
See the model home.
It's open for destruction.
And it's all yours, boys!
It's all yours!
What'd I tell ya?
Ain't this a swell joint?
Yeah! Bein' bad's
a lot of fun, ain't it?
Yeah, uh-huh.
Get a load of that
stained-glass window.
All right, now,
hop to it, you blokes.
Come on! Come on!
Shut the doors
and lock 'em tight!
Now get below
and get them crates ready.
Give a bad boy enough rope,
and he'll soon make
a jackass of himself.
Where is everybody?
Place is like a graveyard.
I don't like the looks
of this.
Hey, where are you?!
Where do you suppose all
the kids went to, Lampwick?
They're around here somewheres.
What do you care?
You're having a good time,
ain't ya?
I sure am.
Oh, boy. This is the life,
huh, Pinokey?
Yeah.
It sure is.
Ah, you smoke
like me grandmother.
Come on, take a big drag!
Like this.
Okay, Lampy.
Some fun, huh, kid?
Okay, Slats, your shot.
What's the matter, Slats?
Losin' your grip?
So this is where I find you!
How do you ever expect to be
a real boy?!
Look at yourself... smokin'!
Playin' pool!
You're comin' right home
with me this minute!
Hey... who's the beetle?
Put me down!
He's my conscience.
He tells me what's
right and wrong.
What?!
You mean to tell me you take
orders from a grasshopper?!
Grasshopper?!
Look here,
you ignorant young pup!
It wouldn't hurt you to take
orders from your grasshopper...
your conscience...
if you have one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Screwball
in the corner pocket.
Why, you young hoodlum,
I'll knock your block off!
Why, I'll take you apart
and put you back together!
Oh, don't hurt him, Jiminy.
He's my best friend.
Why, I'll...
Your best friend?!
And what am I?
Just your conscience.
Okay, that settles it.
But, Jiminy...
You buttered your bread.
Now sleep in it!
Go on, laugh!
Make a jackass outta yourself!
I am through!
This is the end.
But, Jiminy...
Lampwick says
a guy only lives once.
Come on! Come on!
Let him go!
Burns me up.
After all I tried to do
for him.
Who's his conscience anyway...
me or that hoodlum Lampwick?
I've had enough of this.
I'm taking the next boat
outta here.
Open up that door.
Open up!
I want to go home!
Come on, you blokes!
Keep her moving!
Lively there, now.
We haven't got all night!
Where'd all the donkeys
come from?
Come on! Come on!
Let's have another!
And what's your name?
Okay, you'll do.
I n you go!
You boys will bring
a nice price!
All right, next!
And what might your name be?
So you can talk.
Yes, sir.
I want to go home to my mama!
Take him back!
He can still talk!
Please, please, I don't want
to be a donkey!
Let me outta here!
Quiet!
You boys have had your fun.
Now pay for it!
Boys?
So that's...
Hear that beetle talk...
you'd think somethin'
was gonna happen to us.
Conscience.
Where does he get that stuff?
"How do ya ever expect
to be a real boy?"
What's he think
I look like...
a jackass?
You sure do!
Hey, you laugh like a donkey!
Did that come outta me?
What the...
What's goin' on?!
I've been double-crossed!
Help! Help!
Somebody help!
I've been framed!
Help!
Please, you've gotta help me!
Be a pal!
Call that beetle!
Call anybody!
Mama!
Mama!
What's happened?!
I hope I'm not too late!
What'll I do?!
Oh, Jiminy, help!
Quick!
The kids! The boys!
They're all donkeys!
You too!
Come on, quick!
Before you get any worse!
This way, Pinoke!
It's the only way out!
Hurry up...
before they see us!
You gotta jump!
You all right?
Sure.
I thought we'd never make it.
Certainly feels good
to be back on...
dry land.
Come on. Let's get home.
Father! Father, I'm home!
We're home, Mr. Geppetto!
Home again!
It's me... Pinocchio!
I'm home to stay!
Here he is, Mr. Geppetto!
Home at last!
Hey, maybe he's asleep.
Father!
Father, it's me!
Pinoke, come here.
Look.
He ain't here.
He's gone.
Yeah, and Figaro.
And Cleo, too.
Maybe somethin' awful
happened to him.
Don't worry, son.
He probably hasn't gone far.
It's a message.
What's it say?
It's about your father.
Where is he?
Why, it says here...
he went looking for you,
and he was swallowed by a whale.
Swallowed by a whale?!
Yeah...
A whale?!
A whale named Monstro!
Oh, he's...
But wait. He's alive.
Alive? Where?
Inside the whale
at the bottom of the sea.
Bottom of the sea?!
Hey! Where you goin'?!
I'm going to find him!
But, Pinoke, are you crazy?!
Don't you realize
he's in a whale?
I gotta go to him.
Hey, Pinoke! Wait!
Listen here, son!
But this Monstro...
I've heard of him.
He's a whale of a whale!
Why, he swallows
whole ships alive!
Tie it good and tight, now.
And besides, it's dangerous.
Bye, Jiminy.
Goodbye?
I may be live bait down there,
but I'm with ya. Come on.
Let's go.
Look out below!
Gangway down there!
Gee... what a big place!
Come on, Jiminy!
All right.
Soon as I take on
some ballast.
One side, sister.
Well, so long.
Put it in the wrong end.
No more privacy
than a goldfish.
Ooh! Chilly!
Father!
Father!
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!
Father!
Father!
He ain't my father.
Hey, what the...
Let go!
Run along,
you little... squirt.
What's the matter, kid?
I was only...
We were only looking
for Monstro.
That got 'em.
Father!
Father!
Hello.
Can you tell me
where we can find Monstro?
Will ya?
Gee. They're scared.
Pardon me, Pearl.
Are you acquainted
with Monstro, the whale?
Whoa, hold it, there.
Father!
One side there, son.
Come on, boys, break it up.
Break it up, now.
Hey, what the...
Quit shovin', now.
Don't...
Take it easy.
Take it easy, there.
Whoo, whoo, whoo, there.
Steady there, Nellie.
Go ahead, Pinoke.
Ask them.
Could any of you tell me
where to find Monstro?
Whoa, boy! Whoa! Hey!
Thanks a lot.
Father!
Father!
Not a bite for days.
We can't hold out much longer.
I never thought it would end
this way, Figaro...
starving to death...
in the belly of a whale.
My poor little Pinocchio.
He was such a good boy.
It's hopeless, Figaro.
There isn't a fish left.
If the monster doesn't
wake up soon...
I'm afraid we are done for.
Here they come!
Tuna!
Oh, tuna fish!
Food! We'll eat!
Here's a big one.
Get them in there, Figaro!
Wait!
Wait a minute!
Have you seen...
Oh, we gotta get out of here!
Come on, Pinoke,
don't wait for me!
Never saw so many!
Here's another one!
Enough for weeks!
Here's a big one.
Keep them in there, Figaro!
Hey, blubber mouth, open up!
I gotta get in there!
It looks like
the last of them.
Here's a big one!
Only a few left!
We gotta work fast!
Hey!
Here's another one!
Hey, Father!
Father!
Don't bother me now,
Pinocchio!
Father!
My son!
Hey, Father! Here I am!
Oh, oh, yes!
My boy.
I'm so happy to see you!
Me, too, Father.
You're here, too.
Yes.
We all are together again.
Ooh, you are soaking wet.
Yes, Father.
You mustn't catch cold.
But I came to see you!
You know, you shouldn't
have come down here.
But, Father...
But I'm awfully glad
to see you.
Let me take your hat.
What's the matter?
Those ears!
Ears?
Oh, these.
Oh, that's nothing.
I got a tail, too!
What's happened to you?
Well, I...
Oh, never mind now.
Old Geppetto has
his little wooden head.
Nothing else matters.
I gotta get in.
My pal's in there!
Come on, ya big moose,
open up, I tell ya!
Cut it out!
Go on!
Beat it, ya buzzards!
Get out?
Oh, no, no, son.
I've tried every way.
Why, I even built a raft!
A raft?
That's it.
We'll take the raft,
and when the whale
opens his mouth...
No, no, no, no.
Now listen, son.
He only opens his mouth
when he's eating.
Then everything comes in.
Nothing goes out.
It's hopeless, Pinocchio.
Come, we'll make a nice fire,
and we'll cook
some of the fish.
A fire! That's it!
Yes, and then we'll all
eat again.
A great big fire!
Lots of smoke!
Smoke? Oh, yeah, sure.
A smoked fish
will taste good.
Quick... some wood!
Pinocchio, not the chair!
Hurry, Father! More wood!
Oh, what will we sit on
if we...
We won't need it!
We're getting out!
Getting out? But how?
We'll make him sneeze!
Make him sneeze?
Ohh, that will make him mad!
Well, it's about time!
- It won't work!
- Hurry, Father!
Climb aboard!
We'll never get by
those teeth!
Yes, we will!
Hey, which way you goin'?!
Wait for me!
Hang on! Here we go!
Gesundheit.
We are going back!
No, we'll make it!
Faster! Faster!
It's no use!
Here it goes!
We made it!
Look, now he is mad!
I told you he'd be furious!
He's gone!
Where'd he go?!
Look out!
Hang on!
He's coming back! Hurry!
He's trying to get us!
Paddle, son!
Let's go back!
Look out! Jump!
Father! Father!
Oh, Father!
Pinocchio, swim for shore.
Swim for shore.
Hang on, Father!
Save... yourself.
Save yourself.
Don't mind me, son.
Save yourself...
My boy...
My brave little boy...
Prove yourself brave,
truthful, and unselfish,
and someday
you will be a real boy.
Awake, Pinocchio.
Awake.
Father!
Whatcha cryin' for?
'Cause... you're dead,
Pinocchio.
No! No, I'm not!
Yes, yes, you are.
Now lie down...
But, Father, I'm alive.
See?
And...
And I'm...
I'm...
I'm real!
I'm a real boy!
You're alive!
And you are a real boy!
A real, live boy!
This calls for a celebration!
Professor! Lots of music!
Well! This is practically
where I came in.
Thank you, milady.
He deserved to be
a real boy.
And it sure was nice
of you to...
Well, I'll be!
My, my!
Solid gold, too.
Oh, I think it's swell!
