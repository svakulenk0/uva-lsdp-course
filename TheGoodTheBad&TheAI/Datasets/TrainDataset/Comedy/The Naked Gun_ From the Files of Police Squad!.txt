Listen to me! Killing a few
hostages is not sufficient!
The Americans must be made to suffer.
- We must humiliate them.
-
You do not go far enough,
General Amin.
We must strip their entrails out
and drag them from here to Damascus,
until they include us
in the peace process.
Nonsense! This solution
is not bold enough for Libya.
I say wipe out Washington
and New York.
What? And spoil three years
of good public relations?
I have the Americans believing
I am a nice guy.
In some of their polls,
I'm more popular than their president.
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
This is getting us nowhere.
If we do nothing else this week,
we must conceive
at least one terrorist act
that will show all the world
that the United States,
the great Satan,
is but a paper tiger, a weak nation,
a weak people,
a people ripe for destruction.
Cowards, no longer willing to fight.
Ahh!
I knew it!
Yeah!
Hey, who are you?
I'm Lieutenant Frank Drebin,
Police Squad.
-
- And don't ever let me
catch you guys in America!
- Watch out!
- Whoa!
-
-
...38, 39, 40.
It's all here.
This completes
our first shipment of heroin.
Ah, it better be.
All 40 kilos.
The final shipment
will be delivered in three days.
-
-
Police! Throw down your guns!
Kill him.
-
- Ahh!
Oh, no!
It's a great day for
Americans everywhere. This man alone...
- There he is!
-
No flowers, thank you.
Welcome home, Frank. Good work
in Beirut. We all heard what you did.
Thank you, Ed. I want to know one thing:
is it true what you
wrote me about Victoria?
I'm afraid so, Frank.
She just ran off with some guy.
They got married last week.
Then it's over. It's all over.
All of this is meaningless.
I did it for her.
I did everything for her.
And now she's gone.
And you came down here
to get the hot story, didn't you?
Pictures of me
to sell your lousy newspapers.
- Frank...
- Sure, you think I'm a big hero,
the man of the hour, well...
Do any of you understand
how a man can hurt inside?
Frank, they're not here for you.
"Weird Al" Yankovic is on the plane.
What about the wedding?
What was she wearing?
Don't torture yourself, Frank!
Just put her out of your mind.
I can't get her out of my mind.
What about the guy?
- Do you know anything about him?
- Not much.
Just that he's an Olympic gymnast
and it's the best sex she's ever had.
I trusted her and followed my heart.
Foolishly, it seems.
I'm just gonna have to learn to forget.
That's why I took my vacation in Beirut,
to get her out of my mind,
to find some peace.
It's not gonna be easy.
Everywhere I look,
something reminds me of her.
Maybe it's just that cops
and women don't mix.
What about Nordberg?
I came as soon as I heard.
He's alive, Frank,
though he's on life support.
Doctors say he's got
a 50-50 chance of living,
though there's only
a ten percent chance of that.
Mrs. Nordberg, I think
we can save your husband's arm.
Where would you like it sent?
Oh Frank! I'm so glad you came!
Wilma, it's good to see you.
I came as soon as I heard.
- Thank you, Frank.
- You bet.
- Where's Nordberg?
- He's right here.
Nordberg, it's me, Frank, your buddy.
- Oh!
- Ah!
I'll get it!
Ah!
Get the switch
on the bottom of the bed!
Nordberg, it's me, Frank.
Who did this to you?
I... love you.
I love you, too, Nordberg.
Who were they?
- Ship... Boat...
- That's right. Nordberg. A boat.
When you're better,
we'll go sailing together,
on a boat, we'll take a cruise,
just like last year.
No... Drugs.
Hey, nurse, give this man some drugs!
Quick! Can't you see he's in pain?
- Give him a shot, quickly!
- No...
Heroin! Heroin, Frank!
Nordberg,
that's a pretty tall order.
You're gonna have to give me
a couple of days on that one.
Oh, my poor Nordberg!
He was such a good man, Frank.
He never wanted to hurt anyone.
Who would do such a thing?
It's hard to tell.
Could be a roving gang of thugs,
a blackmailer, an angry husband,
a gay lover...
Frank, get a hold of yourself!
A good cop, needlessly
cut down and ambushed
by some cowardly hoodlums.
- That's no way for a man to die.
-  You're right, Ed.
A parachute not opening,
that's a way to die.
Getting caught
in the gears of a combine,
having your nuts bit off
by a Laplander.
That's the way I want to go.
Oh, Frank!
Oh, this is terrible!
Don't you worry, Wilma,
your husband is going to be all right.
Don't you worry about anything.
Just think positive.
Never let a doubt enter your mind.
He's right, Wilma, but I wouldn't wait
until the last minute
to fill out those organ donor cards.
What I'm trying to say is,
as soon as Nordberg is better,
he's welcome back at Police Squad.
Unless he's a drooling vegetable,
- but I think that's only common sense.
-
Wilma, can you think of any reason
that Nordberg was
at the waterfront last night?
No.
But I found this
at home in a drawer.
A photograph!
"I Luv You" out of Caracas.
A Panamanian ship.
When Nordberg said "I love you",
he was telling you the name of the ship!
I realize that... now.
- We'd better check this out.
- I want every available man on this.
I can't spare anybody, Frank.
You know we're in charge of security
for Queen Elizabeth's visit.
I'm shorthanded already.
Wilma, I promise you,
whatever scum did this,
not one man on this force
will rest for one minute
until he's behind bars.
- Now, let's grab a bite to eat.
- Yeah, come on, Wilma.
Due to the extraordinary efforts
of some of our civic leaders,
Queen Elizabeth has included
the city of Los Angeles
as one of the three cities she will
visit during her American tour.
Mayor Barkley, will the city hire
additional security officers
for the police force
during the Queen's visit?
We have placed the Queen's security
in the hands of Police Squad,
a special division
of the Police Department,
represented here today
by Lieutenant Frank Drebin.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Louder!
-  You can use my radio mic.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Protecting the safety of the Queen
is a task that is gladly accepted
by Police Squad.
For no matter how silly the idea
of having a queen might be to us,
as Americans we must be gracious
and considerate hosts.
Uh, Thank you, Lieutenant Drebin.
Of course, we all have a stake
in seeing that this portion...
...of the Queen's American goodwill tour
is completely protected.
And we can all take pride
that the Queen has chosen
our city to visit.
Indeed, it is for all the people,
who will be able to share
in these, uh... celebrations...
- Especially exciting...
-
...will be... the Queen's...
...public appearances.
Um, we also would like...
-
-
-
-  Whoops!
-  Uh-oh.
-
Ed and I drove
down to the docks,
where Nordberg had been found
floating face down in the water.
In a case where there are no
leads, you have to start somewhere,
Please disperse. Please disperse.
Keep moving.
Where did they find Nordberg, Ed?
Right out there, Frank.
Do you wanna take a dinghy?
No, I took care of that
at the press conference.
Doesn't make sense, you know.
Good policeman, bright future...
then something like this happens.
He was found by the night watchman.
Wed better do some checking around.
I'm gonna talk to the harbormaster.
I'll walk around the docks,
take a snoop.
- Yeah?
- Lieutenant Drebin, Police Squad.
Oh, I remember you, Drebin.
What do you want?
I wanna ask some questions.
Are you familiar with that face?
I don't know.
My memory ain't so great.
Oh, yeah?
Maybe this'll refresh your memory.
- I don't know, still kind of hazy.
- How about this?
Yeah. I remember him.
I used to see him around.
Why do you want to know?
- I can't tell you that.
- Maybe this'll help.
- I really don't think I should.
- Still don't think so?
All right, his name is Nordberg,
he's a cop.
- He was no cop, he was dealing H.
- What?
I'm telling you, he was dirty!
You sniveling scum!
I ought to run you in right now!
All right, he worked
at Ludwig's Shipping.
He tried to push something
on one of my boys.
What are you gonna do about it, copper?
Why should I tell you?
- Maybe this'll help.
- I still don't think I should tell you.
Can you spot me 20? How about now?
All right, I'm going down
to Ludwig's office.
I'll find out
if you're telling the truth.
Vincent Ludwig presided
over one of the largest
A respected business man and
civic leader, the mayor had chosen him
to be the chairman of
the Queen's reception committee.
Now I was getting ready
to question him
about drugs and attempted murder
on his own docks.
- Mr. Ludwig?
- Yes?
Lieutenant Drebin to see you, sir.
Show him in.
- Lieutenant.
- The feeling is mutual.
Nice to meet you, too.
Uh, Cuban?
Uh, no, Dutch-Irish.
My father was from Wales.
Oh.
Uh, sit down.
Magnificent office
you have here, Mr. Ludwig.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Most objects I have collected
over a period of many years.
The Gainsborough, Ming vases.
Priceless!
They are objects which I feel
reflect my personality,
like the Japanese fighting fish.
Beautiful, graceful, elegant...
...yet single-minded of purpose
and deadly when it finds
what it wants.
This particular one
is valued at over $20,000.
A luxury item, to be certain,
but as you can see, I am a man who
appreciates the finer things in life.
Oh, this! This is a rare Samurai pen,
a gift from Emperor Hirohito.
Unbreakable.
Impervious to everything but water.
- Its value is beyond estimation.
- That's fascinating.
But I'm sure you didn't
pay me this visit
to hear a lecture on fine art,
Lieutenant.
To what do I owe the honor?
I'm investigating the attempted murder
of one of your dock workers...
..a man named Nordberg,
a police officer.
He's still alive, then?
He was shot six times.
Fortunately, the bullets
missed every vital organ,
and the salt water preserved him
until he was found.
So they were able to...
So they were able to get him
to the hospital in time?
Yes, he's in the intensive care ward
at Our Lady of the Worthless Miracle.
Well, this certainly comes
as a shock to me, Lieutenant.
But as you know,
I am not the kind of man
who takes this type of thing lightly.
And there is no room
in my organization
Ahh!
For any type of criminal activity.
Look out there.
A vast commercial
development built by me.
Do you have any idea what was
out there just five years ago?
Yeah!
You bet you do. Orange groves!
Acres of them.
As far as the eye could see.
But now, of course,
that land is able to generate
ten times the amount of profit
per square foot.
Are you all right, Lieutenant?
Here, let me get you some Kleenex.
Has this officer...
What's his name? Nordberg?
...Been able to tell you anything?
Uh, well, of course, he hasn't been
able to tell us a thing so far,
but as soon as
he regains consciousness,
we'll see if he
can still play the guitar.
I beg your pardon?
Uh, I've taken up too much
of your time already.
I'd like to look at your
employment records now,
and speak to someone in Personnel.
- If you don't mind, of course.
- Of course.
Dominique, will you please
send in Ms. Spencer.
Yes, sir.
As you know, I am quite busy
making last minute arrangements
for the royal visit,
but I'll have my assistant
provide you with anything you need.
You've been very cooperative.
I'll make a note of that in my report.
My pleasure.
Ah, Ms. Spencer, this is Lieutenant
Frank Drebin from Police Squad.
Hello... Mr. Drebin.
Hello.
Her hair was the color
of gold in old paintings.
and the kind of legs
you'd like to suck on for a day.
She was giving me a look
I could feel in my hip pocket.
Yep, this was starting
to get interesting.
Nice beaver.
Thank you. I just had it stuffed.
Let me help you with that.
This should be
what you're looking for, Lieutenant.
The shipping and employment records
for Pier 32.
Thank you.
I've heard police work is dangerous.
It is, that's why I carry a big gun.
Aren't you afraid it might
go off accidentally?
I used to have that problem.
What did you do about it?
I just think about baseball.
That's a honey of an ankle-bracelet
you have there.
Did it slip down there again?
Yes, well...
I'll go through this as fast as I can
and get them back to you tomorrow.
That would be fine, but there's no rush.
I mean, whenever you're through.
Thank you. I wish there was
some way I could repay you.
How about dinner?
I know this little out-of-the-way place
that serves great Viking food.
That's quite
a tempting offer, Lieutenant,
but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
get my rest this evening,
tomorrow being Arbor Day and all.
Of course. Perhaps some other time.
- How about a rain check?
- Well, let's just stick to dinner.
Thank you for your help, Ms. Spencer.
My pleasure.
- Well?
- Mr. Ludwig, you startled me!
I'm sorry, my dear.
I just wanted to know if you
got the lieutenant what he wanted?
Yes, I gave him copies
of the files for Pier 32.
Good. That's good.
He is an intriguing fellow, this
Lieutenant Drebin, don't you think?
Well, I don't know.
I've only just met him.
He seems very nice.
Jane, I realize
this is an unusual request,
but if there is something illegal
going on in this company,
I need to know everything about it,
so we can root out any wrongdoers.
That's why I want you to...
...well, to get to know
Lieutenant Drebin a little better,
find out what he knows.
Oh, Mr. Ludwig, don't you think
this is best handled by the police?
We are letting
the police handle it, my dear!
But this company
needs to know the facts quickly,
before anything
gets into the newspapers.
Don't forget, I have a responsibility
to the stockholders.
Well... if you put it that way...
- Yes, I'll do my best.
- That's better.
I'm sure you will.
It was about 4:00pm
when I returned to Police Squad.
I figured I'd stop by
and see what the lab boys
had come up with
on Nordberg's jacket,
You can tell a lot from fiber samples
if they aren't too wet.
And I was hoping in this case
we wouldn't come up dry...
Hey, look out!
Police! Halt!
Anybody catch the license plate?
Anybody get a look at the driver?
Get out of the way!
Take the names of everybody here
for questioning.
I've got to get... inside.
Hi, Ed, Ted. You got
those fiber samples yet?
- Sh-sh! We got some action out here.
- What's happening?
We're testing
that new anti-graffiti wall.
It looks like we've got customers.
It's set to react when the spray
hits the sensors.
You've done it again. Mazel tov!
Good work, Ted.
What will you lab boys think of next?
Now that you mention it,
here's something
we developed only yesterday.
To the casual observer,
an ordinary shoe.
But in actuality...
it makes quite a handy weapon.
And everything a cop
in the field would need.
We call it the Swiss Army shoe.
That's great, Ted.
What about the fiber samples?
Uh, let me just show you
one more thing, Frank.
You see these cufflinks I'm wearing?
They're not just cufflinks.
Each one fires a single pin-sized dart,
that knocks out your victim
for a few minutes,
but does no permanent damage.
- Here, let me demonstrate on Ed.
- Huh?
Ted! Why?
Don't worry.
He'll be up and around in no time.
Why don't you take a pair, Frank?
Well, actually, I could use
another pair of cufflinks.
Good, I think you'll like them.
- You want this, chief?
- Yes, thank you, Al.
There's something
on the side of your mouth, Al.
No, no, the other side.
As you requested, Frank, we took some
fiber samples from Nordberg's jacket.
I'm afraid it doesn't look good.
- What do you mean?
- Take a look for yourself.
- I can't see anything.
- Use your open eye, Frank.
Oh, yeah, I can see it now.
At first glance, it would appear
to be the normal cotton fibers.
When we focused in closer,
we discovered a fine, white powder.
-
-
We tested it. Pure heroin.
How well do you know Nordberg?
We were partners for nine years
and he's my best friend.
I know, Frank, but we can't allow
personal feelings to get in the way.
Are you saying that Nordberg is...?
I'm telling you that the Queen
arrives here the day after tomorrow.
If the press should pick this up,
with Nordberg still part of the force,
it could be embarrassing
to the police and the city.
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm giving you
- Mr. Ludwig?
- Yes?
- A Mr. Pahpshmir is here.
- Show him in.
Is there something wrong, Mr. Ludwig?
No, no, it's nothing.
- Then may we get down to business?
- Certainly. Please have a seat.
I can carry out your request.
- My price is 20 million dollars.
- Your price is not a problem.
But there is concern
on the part of those I represent,
that you would be able to...
...complete so difficult a task.
Tell me, Mr. Pahpshmir,
in all the world,
who is the most effective assassin?
Well, I would think anyone
who manages to conceal
his identity as an assassin.
Yes, but there is
an even more ideal assassin.
One who doesn't know
he is an assassin.
- Care for some tea?
- Yes, please.
Dominique, service for two, please.
I must kill Pahpshmir.
Will that be
with cream and sugar, sir?
Mr. Pahpshmir?
Cream only, please.
- Oh! There's a gun on the floor, sir!
- Just leave it there.
It's all right, Dominique.
- The tea, please.
- Of course, sir.
Tell me, Mr. Pahpshmir, have you ever
seen sensory-induced hypnosis?
I think I just have.
But how will you get her
near the target?
I doubt if it will be her.
Good secretaries
are so hard to find these days.
And it seems to me...
...anyone can be an assassin.
I had 24 hours
to come up with something
I decided to return to the hospital
with Ludwig's shipping records
Oh, Dr. Alford, I have Mrs. Kepley's
chart, if you're ready to go over it.
I'll be with you when
I've finished with Mr. Nordberg.
Yes, doctor.
I'll have you out of here
in a couple of...
I'd like to see Officer Nordberg.
All right, I'll need you to sign in...
Wait a minute!
Where's the police officer
who was on guard at that door?
Lieutenant Drebin called
and sent him home.
Lieutenant Drebin?
I must kill Nordberg.
Drebin, Police Squad!
Let go of that pillow!
Ah!
-
-
Hey!
Medical emergency!
Drebin, Police Squad.
Follow that black car!
The car! Follow that car!
Stephanie, check your mirror. Signal.
Now, pull into traffic.
Try and ease off on the brake.
-  Give it a little gas.
- I know a shortcut. Turn left here!
- There he is!
-  Easy!
Turn right! Follow him to the right!
It's OK. Normally,
you would not be going 65
down the wrong way
of a one way street.
-
- Ahh!
Apply the brakes.
Now put it in reverse.
- You dumb broad!
- Stephanie, gently extend your arm.
Extend your middle finger.
- Very good. Well done.
- There he is!
Go for it, Stephanie!
Oh no!
-
-
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
All right, move on!
Nothing to see here!
Please disperse!
Nothing to see here. Please!
The attempt on Nordberg's life
left me shaken and disturbed.
And all the questions kept
coming up over and over again,
Who was this character
in the hospital?
Why was he trying to kill
Nordberg, and for whom?
Did Ludwig lie to me?
I didn't have any proof,
but somehow,
I didn't entirely trust him, either.
I Luv You
It was almost midnight
when I got to my door.
I just wanted a glass of Bosco
and then slip under my blankets.
But my night was
just about to begin.
You're late.
That depends on what I'm late for.
You said we should
have dinner sometime.
Tonight became "sometime".
I'm boiling a roast.
How hot and wet do you like it?
Very hot and awfully wet.
You seem to know your way
around a kitchen.
I'm just as handy
in other rooms of the house.
That shirt looks familiar.
It's yours. I didn't want
to get stained or wrinkled.
At least... not yet.
Do you mind if I slip
into something more comfortable?
There. That's better.
I hope you've brought your appetite.
I've brought everything.
Well, then, dig in.
Interesting. Almost as interesting
as the photographs I saw today.
I was young. I needed the work.
No, no, they were taken
at Ludwig's docks.
A ship came in, a Panamanian ship.
It wasn't on Ludwig's records.
Probably an oversight.
How is your... meat?
You be the judge of that.
Mmm.
Mmm.
I've got nine more.
Have you seen that ship?
I don't know.
It doesn't look like one of ours.
But then again,
we deal with so many ships.
Has Officer Nordberg been able to, um...
tell you anything?
No, there was another attempt
on his life. He's back in a coma.
That's terrible!
This world is such a violent place.
If it wasn't, I'd be out of a job.
I'd be back on the circuit,
riding motocross.
But I'd give it all up tomorrow
to live in a world without crime.
That's beautiful.
This is all happening too fast.
-  I've been hurt before.
- I'm sorry.
I'd known her for years.
We used to go to
all the police functions together.
Ah, how I loved her,
but she had her music.
I think she had her music.
She'd hung out with the
Chicago Male Chorus and Symphony.
I don't recall her playing an instrument
or being able to carry a tune.
Yet she was on the road
In fact, I bought her
a harp for Christmas.
She asked me what it was.
It's the same old story.
Boy finds girl, boy loses girl,
girl finds boy...
...boy forgets girl,
boy remembers girl...
...girl dies in a tragic blimp accident
over the Orange Bowl
on New Year's Day.
- Goodyear?
- No, the worst.
Poor dear!
Now, now, I don't want to upset you.
Frank, it's not that.
Why did you have to be so wonderful?
- There's something I ought to tell you.
- No! No need to tell me anything.
What's in the past
doesn't matter anyway.
Maybe...
Maybe we're just two lonely souls
who have found each other.
Funny face.
I want you to know, I...
practice safe sex.
So do I.
I had a wonderful day, Frank.
I can't believe
we just met yesterday.
You really mean that, Jane?
You're not just saying it,
because we exchanged bodily fluids?
No, I really mean it.
You're very special.
- Can I interest you in a nightcap?
- No, thank you, I don't wear them.
Actually, I'm on duty.
We're on stakeout tonight.
But I'll be thinking about you.
I'll call you tomorrow.
OK.
Good night!
I'm telling you, the answer's
up there in Ludwig's office.
Call it what you will,
a hunch, women's intuition.
Ludwig knows a lot more
than he's telling us.
A hunch won't stand up in court, Frank.
Where are your hard facts?
Look, he's the only
one outside of ourselves
who knew that Nordberg was still alive.
Next thing we know, some thug tries
to knock Nordberg off in the hospital.
That may be. But breaking into
Ludwig's office is taking a big chance.
I know.
You could take a chance getting up
in the morning, crossing the street
or sticking your face in a fan.
Look, there he is.
All right, just trust me on this, Ed.
I know I'm right.
OK, but be careful.
You get a good night's sleep.
I'll see you in the morning.
Bingo!
"20,000,000 deposited,
Omani Bank, Zurich,
upon proof of Queen's death."
Ah!
Oh!
Oh!
-
-  Oh! Oh!
Oh, my God!
-
-
Ah.
Oh!
-
-
destroying property, arson,
sexual assault
with a concrete dildo?
What the hell were you doing there
in the first place?
Yes, I know, I'm sorry about that,
Your Honor,
but we have reason to believe
that Vincent Ludwig
is involved in a plot
to assassinate the Queen.
That's ridiculous!
Where is this evidence?
Well, it... burned in the fire.
Gentlemen...
Vincent Ludwig is one of the most
respected members of this community.
And if we're all very nice to him,
he will agree not to press charges.
- Your Honor!
- Did I make myself clear?
Yes, Your Honor, very clear. Good day.
Oh, Drebin!
I don't want any more trouble like
you had last year on the south side.
Understand? That's my policy.
Yes, well when I see
five weirdos dressed in togas
stabbing a guy in the middle of the
park in full view of a hundred people,
I shoot the bastards.
That's my policy.
That was a Shakespeare In the Park
production of  you moron!
- You killed five actors! Good ones.
- Your Honor...
Drebin, your presence at the Queen's
reception tonight will not be necessary.
Is that understood?
We understand, Your Honor.
Thank you.
The plane has taxied to a stop.
Any minute now,
we expect the doors to open
and we'll get our first glimpse of
the Queen, as she begins her first visit
to the Los Angeles area
in over five years.
That's right Bob,
and it's a balmy, beautiful evening
for it too. She'll be going
straight from here
to a formal reception
hosted by the mayor, in honor of...
-
-
- Jane!
- Frank!
I'm just making some dinner.
Are you hungry?
Well, maybe just a bite.
I just talked to Vincent Ludwig.
He wanted me to ask you
to meet him tonight.
Jane, I think there's
something you should know.
I was up in Vincent Ludwig's
place last night.
Oh, how nice! Did he show you his
priceless collection of Ming vases
and all those rare oil paintings?
And what about...?
Jane, I think that Vincent Ludwig
is involved in a number
of criminal activities.
Oh, Frank, stop it!
Vincent Ludwig is a well-respected,
generous, kind man.
It's just too bad
you don't know him like I do.
- Oh, yeah? And how's that?
- What's that supposed to mean?
I'm... sorry.
I'm worried about you. I don't trust him
and I don't want to see you
getting mixed up in anything dangerous.
Oh, Woo's... They back in business?
I thought they closed down
three years ago.
Why, gee, has it been that long?
I don't feel like Chinese
tonight anyway.
Frank, it's sweet of you
to be concerned about me,
but you're really wrong
about Vincent Ludwig.
He's such a gentleman.
He's so generous.
He just wants to have a talk with you
to clear up any doubts
you might have about him.
- When?
- Tonight.
He wants you to meet him
at the 7th Street stockyards.
Near the 53rd Street entrance.
All right, but you promise me
that you'll be careful.
Of course I will, funny face, for you.
Ah, I've got to go.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Are you sure you won't have
something to eat?
Ludwig?
-  Drebin?
- Yeah, I'm Drebin.
I have a message for you
from Vincent Ludwig!
-
-
I'm sorry, I can't hear you!
Don't fire the gun
while you're talking!
All right, put your gun down
and your hands up!
Matthews, stake out that end,
Adcock, check for anyone
suspicious-looking.
- Ed...
- Frank, what are you doing here?
I just came from the stockyards,
trading shots
with one of Ludwig's goons.
They're planning
to do it tonight, Ed, here.
That's' why they're trying
to knock me off.
Right. We'd better be on the lookout.
Right, excuse me, ma'am, security.
-
-
- What's the meaning of this?
- All right, just relax.
Take it easy.
Nothing's gonna happen.
- I didn't do anything.
- Oh, yeah? Well, what about this?
You think we were born yesterday?
You didn't do anything, huh?
I got rights...
Look, Ed, he's got
a picture of your wife!
Ethel!
-
-
All right, anyone else here
seeing his wife?
That's all right. That's OK, Frank.
Let's get in the hall.
Are you enjoying yourself, my dear?
Oh, Mr. Ludwig,
I'm so excited to be here.
I really do appreciate your inviting me.
The pleasure is all mine, my dear.
- And perhaps afterwards we can...
-
- Drebin!
- Frank!
You're both right.
Surprised to see me, Mr. Ludwig?
This is not the time
or place to talk.
It's way past the time we talked.
The gloves are off,
I'm playing hardball, Ludwig.
It's fourth and fifteen, and
you're looking at a full court press.
Mr. Drebin!
If you have evidence, then use it.
If not, I am warning you,
get off my back!
Or I promise you,
it will cost you dearly.
Frank, what's wrong?
A lot of things, sweetie-pie.
A little meeting that turned into
a peek-a-boo session with bullets,
all set up by someone who's been
playing me like a violin
at the annual Saps Convention.
Funny face, I don't know
what you're talking about.
My stockyard meeting, butter wings.
Or don't you remember setting that up?
But Mr. Ludwig said you called
the meeting off! Believe me, I...
Hum me another one, shnookie lumps!
Frank, it's the truth!
It's true what they say:
cops and women don't mix.
Like eating a spoonful of Drano.
Sure, it'll clean you out,
but it'll leave you hollow inside.
Too bad, sugar puff.
We could have been something.
I was only doing
what I was told to do!
- Like make love to me?
- Frank!
-
-
That only makes things easier, princess.
To think I trusted you!
I made a big mistake.
- Here, you can take this back.
- Whose is that?
- Doesn't matter.
-  Hey, watch it!
Take care of yourself, baby.
By the way, I faked every orgasm.
Oh, funny face!
And to commemorate our friendship,
the city of Los Angeles is proud
to present to the Royal Family
this Revolutionary War musket,
generously donated
by Mr. Vincent Ludwig.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Her Royal Highness,
Queen Elizabeth II!
It's disgusting the way they splash
this stuff all over the newspapers!
What is journalism coming to?
You're laying on top of the Queen
with her legs wrapped around you
and they call that news!
They can't kick you
off the force, Frank.
- It's just not fair.
- I know, Ed. Life isn't always fair.
Just think, the next time I shoot
someone, I could be arrested.
Hey, look at that!
The missing evidence
in the Kelner case!
My God, he was innocent!
He went to the chair
two years ago, Frank.
Well... what's the use?
What good are these damn awards
and citations?
Frank...
Frank, that's not your desk!
- Frank!
- Jane!
- I've been looking all over for you!
- What are you doing here?
Running another errand
for your boyfriend?
I tried to call you last night.
I even went by your place.
- Where were you?
- I was out walking. All night.
Frank, you gotta listen to me!
I have important information for you.
Please believe me. Vincent Ludwig and I,
there was never anything between us.
- He likes East German men.
- What about you?
I like cops.
-  All right! Yeah!
- Settle down. Take it easy.
- What have you got?
- I overheard Ludwig after the banquet.
You were right all along, Frank.
Ludwig is planning to have someone
assassinate the Queen!
- Where?
- At the baseball game.
The Queen will be there this afternoon
as a guest of Ludwig.
I'm supposed to be with him.
Are you telling us that Vincent Ludwig
is going to just shoot the Queen
in front of 60,000 fans?
No, he said a player's gonna do it,
during the 7th-inning stretch.
- That game starts in 20 minutes.
- I'd better get down there right away.
- I'll go with you.
- No, it's best you stay with Ludwig.
That way we won't
arouse any suspicion.
- Right. OK, let's go!
- Wait! Wait!
Now, listen, I've gotten you guys
into enough trouble already.
I don't want you to risk this for me.
I'll go alone.
No! This is gonna get you
back on the force, Frank.
We're all right behind you.
Frank? I wanted you to know now,
I've loved you since the first day
I met you, and I'll never stop.
I'm a very lucky woman.
So am I.
And a good afternoon
to everyone.
where the California Angels
meet the Seattle Mariners
in this exciting
American League West race.
Hello, everybody! I'm Curt Gowdy
along with Jim Palmer,
Tim McCarver, Dick Vitale, Mel Allen,
Dick Enberg and Dr. Joyce Brothers,
inviting you to join us for this
all-important ball game.
And a very special game it is, Curt.
As we all know,
this game is being attended
by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth.
And I'm sure Her Majesty
will enjoy this game, Jim.
We've got all the exits covered.
I ought to go down
and arrest Ludwig right now.
No, Frank, without any evidence,
we've got to let him
make the first move.
Besides, with the mayor,
she'd have you arrested on the spot.
You've gotta stay out of sight.
I've got to get that assassin
before the 7th-inning stretch.
If Jane is right, it could be
any one of those players.
I've got to find a way to get
down there on that field
and search those players.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise and give a hearty
Los Angeles welcome
One moment.
Huh?
- Over there.
- Move down.
These seats are taken.
My dear, is something bothering you?
Why, no, why do you ask?
You haven't said a word.
You seem... nervous.
Well, you know how important
this game is for the Angels.
Why he's not here now?
I do not like being made
to wait for him.
Mr. Pallazzo, our head usher will
be here in two minutes
to take you onto the field.
Please, just wait in here.
He should be here now,
do you understand?
Yes, sir. I'll send him right over.
I do not wait for him!
He waits for me!
- Yes?
- Mr. Pallazzo?
-
- I am the head usher.
- Ah!
- I am here to... Excuse me.
- Mr. Pallazzo?
- Yes?
- I am the head usher.
- One second.
Ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of the California Angels
and the City of Los Angeles,
on the occasion
of Her Majesty's royal visit,
please welcome internationally
renowned opera star, Enrico Pallazzo!
Ladies and gentlemen,
let us honor America,
as Mr. Pallazzo will now sing
our national anthem.
Frank?
-
-
And now, as the crowd
settles back down,
we'll wait for
the exchange of lineups
and the start of today's ball game.
Oh, excuse me, could you tell me,
is this an official bat?
Well, the Queen's visit has brought
a sell-out crowd. Could be a record.
And while the fans
are awaiting the first pitch,
they're being entertained
by the stadium's Angel vision,
showing some of those unusual
moments in baseball over the years.
Whoops.
Sorry, fellas!
-
-
How about that?
Ladies and
gentlemen, now taking the field,
For the safety of the players
and yourself,
we ask that you do not throw any
objects in the stands or on the field.
So, as the Angels take the field,
we're about ready
for the First Pitch ceremony
with the Queen of England
ready to toss out the first ball.
How about that
Queen, ladies and gentlemen?
Well, we're ready for the start
of today's ball game,
and I'm sure that group
of lovely ladies would agree.
Well, they ought to.
Those are the players' wives,
on hand to enjoy
the game with us today.
Introducing
the umpires for today's game,
What do you say, Cummings?
Are we gonna do this today?
Do what? Oh!
Play ball!
Frank! Al, it's Frank!
And this game's underway.
Dave Spiwack ready
to face Jay Johnstone!
- Nothing to report so far, chief.
- Don't worry, Al.
If one of those players is the killer,
Frank is gonna find him,
even if he has to search
every one of them.
...Jay Johnstone. Johnstone.
Hello, pal. You all right?
Let's see if that uniform's on straight.
Pretty good back here.
Now let's see the shirt.
You should take a large.
Little tight in the crotch.
All right? All set?
OK, play ball!
Batter up.
Strike?
Yeah, strike!
Stee-rike two!
Stee-rike three!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Strike!
You're clean!
You're out!
Have you found him yet?
No, and I've searched
almost everybody.
Yeah, I saw that.
There's only one more out
before the 7th innings stretch, Frank.
I'm gonna have my men on the alert,
but you're gonna have to stall them.
Don't let 'em get that third out.
Right, Ed.
The Mariners' short
stop, number four, Armando Personi!
- Ball!
- Ball?
Ball!
Catch it! Catch it!
- Fair ball!
-  Go, go, go!
He's going home,
he's going home!
Block the plate!
- Safe!
- Safe? What do you mean, safe?
I don't believe this!
Hey, second base! On two!
There's a throw by the catcher
and now they've got Personi
hung up between 1st and 2nd!
What the hell
do you think you're doing?
What?
Hey, you're
not supposed to do that!
Hey, wait a minute! Stop that!
Put that back down! Give me that ball!
I'll get you!
I know this is hard to believe,
but apparently the umpires
have got Personi in a run down!
- Safe!
- Safe?
How about that?
- Out!
- Safe!
- Out!
- He was safe!
- Out!
- Safe!
There's a sight I've never seen.
- Out! Out! Out!
- Safe! Safe! Safe!
- Safe!
- What are you doing?
- Safe! Safe! Safe!
-  He was out!
He was safe!
He never tagged him with the ball!
You idiot! He was out
when he ran out of the baseline!
All right, I've had enough!
You're out of here!
- What do you mean?
- You can't throw an umpire out!
All right, you're outta here!
Hold on! Even the guy running
the scoreboard says he was out!
And he's way up there in the mezzanine!
My God, it's the third out!
I must kill... the Queen.
I must kill... the Queen.
Frank! Frank, it's the right fielder!
- You're the boss!
- It was safe.
Now we're going to take you
for a little walk.
To think I respected you.
How could you do something
so vicious?
It was easy, my dear.
Don't forget I spent two years
as a building contractor.
Now let's go quietly.
Hey, look at that!
Come on, let's get him!
Kick him in the balls!
I must kill... the Queen.
Whoops.
-
-
The umpire...
he saved the Queen's life!
That's not the umpire, Your Honor.
Hey, it's Enrico Pallazzo!
Rico Pallazzo! Rico Pallazzo!
Drebin!
Frank! Frank!
Frank! Frank, help!
Frank! Frank, help!
Frank!
-  Frank!
- Stay where you are, Drebin!
- He's got a gun!
- I know.
You ruined my life, Drebin.
Now I'm going to ruin yours.
- Leave the girl alone!
- I am. I'm going to kill you.
- I see.
-
Two can play at that game!
Ah!
- You killed him!
- No, no, he's just stunned.
He'll be all right
in a couple of minutes.
Well...
-
-
Frank... It's horrible!
- It's so horrible!
- I know, Ed.
My father went the same way.
I must kill... Frank Drebin.
I must kill Frank Drebin.
No, no, don't shoot!
Jane... it's me...
-
-  Hey, look! Up there!
If you don't love me,
you might as well pull that trigger,
because without you,
I wouldn't want to live anyway.
I've finally found
someone I can love...
...a good, clean love...
without utensils.
I must kill Frank Drebin.
It's a topsy-turvy world, Jane,
and maybe the problems of two people
don't amount to a hill of beans,
but this is our hill
and these are our beans.
Jane, since I met you, I notice
things I never knew were there before,
birds singing, dew glistening
on a newly-formed leaf...
- I must kill...
- Jane, this morning...
I bought something for you.
It's not very much...
...but pretty good
for an honest policeman's salary.
It's an engagement ring.
I would have given it to you earlier,
but I wanted to wait
until we were alone.
- I...
- I love you, Jane.
Oh, Frank!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry I yelled at you
yesterday, I really am.
Drebin!
I was wrong about you.
This city, and I guess the whole world,
owes you a debt of gratitude.
Thank you, Mayor.
And Monday morning
we want you back at Police Squad...
...with a promotion
to captain, of course.
- Mayor...
- But don't thank me.
There's someone else
here who wants to thank you.
- Nordberg!
- Hiya, buddy!
The doc says I should be on my feet
and as good as new in a week!
- And back on the force!
- Nordberg, that's wonderful!
Whoa!
Oh, Frank! Everyone should
have a friend like you!
