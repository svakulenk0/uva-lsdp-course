He went out to play.
And never came back.
Has he ever run away before?
-No.
Help!
No!
Stop!
COLD PREY
One out of four Norwegians
spends Easter in the mountains.
Four searches are underway.
A total of eight people are missing.
A family of four has been reported
missing since last night.
Bad weather has hampered the
search.
Two men are missing in the
mountains.
Four skiers are feared dead...
The two 31-year-olds never returned
from their climbing expedition.
Red Cross and Norwegian People's
Aid are assisting in the search.
The two were expected back
yesterday afternoon.
in difficult conditions.
have been reported missing...
The search for the missing person
began this morning.
How long have you two been dating?
I don't know about dating.
But we are into each other.
-Into each other?
Jerk!
Another lovely day on the slopes!
The sun is out -
and skiers are pouring in,
so be prepared for long queues.
Not where we're going!
-No, that must be miserable.
To get towed up a hill,
ski down, and go for a beer.
Eirik likes to stretch the limits.
Constantly searching
for the ultimate rush.
Living life on the edge!
This will be great.
-I'm not complaining.
Wait till you're there.
You'll see.
Won't it be great, Mikal?
-Awesome.
Exactly.
Awesome.
Shut up!
Are you moving in together soon?
-Maybe.
No, we...
How about you, Morten Tobias?
Are you getting anything?
Loads! This girl here and I
have sworn to be forever true.
Honestly.
We have sex many times a day.
I have sex with my closest friend.
What's special about that mountain?
-The backside is what's special.
Ready?
-Sure. Let's go.
Up by that overhang...
Wait, dammit!
Slowpoke!
-Shut up!
What's going on, Jannicke?
-What do you mean?
Fear of commitment?
No, that isn't it.
Eirik!
You go so well together.
-I know, but...
What if we start boring
the hell out of each other?
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
You should talk!
"Into each other"?
I can't just tell him
I'm head over heels.
Are you?
-Yes.
Yes, OK?
Yes, I am!
Are you coming?
-Huh?
Are you coming?
-Yeah, yeah.
Are we there yet?
Cool!
Nice!
Holy shit!
-Incredible!
Morten Tobias?
What happened?
What happened?
What is it?
I think he might have
broken something.
Shit!
Just lie down, Morten Tobias.
I have a shirt in there.
Tear it up.
It's OK.
It's just a small fracture.
We have to pull it into place.
Hold here.
Just relax.
Lie back down.
Come here.
Put your hand under there.
Careful!
-Sorry.
Easy now.
Lift it up.
Morten Tobias, keep breathing.
This might hurt a little.
On the count of three. OK?
Ready?
Ready?
One...
Any signal?
-Nope.
Nothing.
There's no signal here.
Now what do we do?
Should I try to go back to the car?
That would take too long.
He needs shelter now.
I could try
to get down to the village.
That would take just as long.
There are some buildings down here!
Are you all right?
Shit!
Hold him.
I'll go check.
Jannicke, toss me a pole!
Here!
-Thanks.
Hey!
Holy shit!
-Sorry.
Mikal, can you give us a hand?
We need to set him down
and elevate his leg.
He can go in here.
Lay him on the table.
Careful!
We need to find a splint for his leg.
Ingunn, light a fire.
Mikal, find some alcohol.
Who made you boss?
-You have a better idea?
Try to relax.
I'll be right back.
Anyone find any painkillers?
-I forgot. Hang on.
Thanks.
-Christ!
Is this good enough?
-Super.
Hey, pills and alcohol...
...probably go great together.
Sorry.
Shit.
Christ!
What the hell is that?
Super glue?
It's all I could find.
But it works quite well.
Shit!
Breathe.
What do we do now?
-I don't know.
The car is too far away.
We'll wait until tomorrow.
Can we, with him?
-Yes. He's fine now.
You did well.
We'll stay here until tomorrow.
-Good idea.
Let's check this place out, then.
-Yes, come on!
I'll wait here.
Eirik?
Where is he going?
-Sightseeing.
An empty room...
Was there a fire here?
-Maybe someone just wanted an axe.
Hey, look at this.
Creepy.
-This is cool!
Are you looking for something, Eirik?
Yes.
This.
Hi.
-Don't do that.
Guess what?
I saw a vacant room.
Can you fire it up?
-We'll see.
We're waiting.
The last time I got drunk on liquor
was my last year at school.
In Mr. Garholm's physics class,
to be exact.
Back then my heart was broken,
not my leg.
He asked me a question
about Uranus.
And I answered, "Hell if I know,
I've never seen your anus!"
And then I threw up
into my neighbour's pencil box.
Are you serious?
-No.
You just made that up?
-Yes.
You're an idiot!
I'll go check.
What was it?
-The door had blown open.
Son of a bitch!
Nice!
-That gave me a jump.
Son of a bitch...
Well done, Eirik!
Let's go look around!
Don't break more than necessary!
Mikal?
Ingunn?
No way!
-It's true.
My hero!
Aren't you
going to contribute, lazybones?
Yeah, yeah.
Shut up!
Lovely music you've selected.
-Me?
I'm not the DJ.
She put this on.
Smell that?
-It smells burnt.
I think it's from over here.
Look at that!
Cool.
The fire probably started right there.
Maybe he was smoking in bed.
He woke up in a panic.
The flames had spread around the room.
He couldn't make it to the door.
The window was stuck,
so he had to break it and...
And then...
Right, the axe!
Someone chopped the door down,
and put out the fire.
Maybe.
But when did this happen?
Why haven't they repaired it?
Mikal?
Stop it.
You jerk!
I'll get you for that!
A draught.
It's good we aren't somewhere
with ski lifts and cold beer.
What happened in the car...
About moving in together.
Don't worry about that.
I just...
-I'm serious.
We'd probably just
bore the hell out of each other.
Eirik, a Snow Daiquiri.
Jannicke, darling,
Yellow Teaser or Pink Heaven?
I want Heaven.
-Yes, baby!
And we found this lovely treat.
A 35-year-old cognac.
The last dash goes to our patient.
Thank you, Mikal.
You are a splendid chap.
Mikal the Splendid!
There's nothing about a fire in here.
There's no mention of a fire
in this register.
You don't write that
in a guest register.
"Thank you for a lovely stay."
"Just a pity that my bed caught fire
and burned my eyes out."
Damn tourists!
Wait, here's something :
"Don't give up hope.
We know you'll find your boy."
Did someone disappear?
That's the last entry.
That's it.
No one has written in this since '75.
The idyllic '70s.
Is that a picture?
Let me see.
No.
-Come on. Let me see!
Give me the damn picture!
Give it to me, Eirik!
Nice catch!
Right, the idyllic '70s.
-Let me see.
Idyllic?
This boy is ugly as sin.
So are you, Mikal.
-No, he isn't!
Mind my leg!
-All right.
But he isn't ugly.
-No, Mikal is a handsome lad.
What was that ruckus you made?
We didn't make a ruckus.
-In the cellar.
We are sweet, innocent children.
-Sweet?
Christ!
Good night.
-Good night, darling.
Good night, darling.
-Good night, Mikal!
Good night, Uncle Tobias.
-Uncle Tobias?
After you, madame.
-Oui oui, Monsieur Mikal.
It's a little cold in here.
I'll warm you up.
Let's wait with that.
Let's wait.
Wait till some other time, OK?
What's the matter?
Is it too cold?
That too.
But it's just...a little soon.
OK, I thought...
Are you angry?
-No.
I'm confused.
I don't know what you want.
What I want?
I like you. You know that, right?
You're just playing with me.
Cock tease.
Maybe I'm trying
to find out who you are.
Something you've made very clear now!
I'm trying!
-Come on.
Holy shit...
Look.
-I don't want to look at your cock.
Look, Jannicke.
-She doesn't want to look either.
Just piss and shut up, OK?
-Look, Jannicke.
Hello?
Mikal?
Hello?
-Hi.
Can you take him?
-Sure.
Are you expecting someone,
or can I join you?
Why don't I get you a bucket...
You're a bucket...
Couldn't you sleep?
I don't know what she wants.
One minute she's ready, and then...
Suddenly she just...
Maybe she's nervous.
Why? It doesn't exactly seem
like I'm her first...
No?
You mean she hasn't...?
She's crazy about you.
I know it for a fact.
Idiot!
She's crazy about you.
It's just that sometimes we girls
need a little more time.
Ingunn?
Ingunn?
I'm sorry about last night.
I was...
I've made you some breakfast.
Fine.
I'll leave it out here.
Are you sure you should leave now?
-I have to go.
Yeah.
Hi. How did it go with Ingunn?
-I don't know.
She wasn't very talkative.
Hi.
Be careful.
-Don't worry.
We'll be out of here
in a couple of hours.
And then you and I are going to relax
in some hotel down in the valley.
Just relax?
Morten Tobias is awake.
Good luck, Eirik.
-Thank you.
Hold that thought.
-You too.
Bye.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Super.
One more.
Is the taxi on its way?
-Eirik is out flagging one down.
Wake me up when he's back.
Didn't she say anything?
-No. Didn't even open the door.
Maybe I should go talk to her.
The generator.
Come on.
Ingunn!
Ingunn!
Hello?
Hello!
Jannicke?
You helped fire it up.
Sure, but Eirik
was the one that fixed it.
He messed around with
something over here.
We can add more fuel here.
Hello?
Hello?
Where is everyone?
There isn't much.
My God!
What is all this?
-It looks like a lost and found.
Check this out.
-Nice!
Has someone been living in here?
Have you heard about
that cabin fellow?
He breaks into cabins
and shits on the floor.
Maybe it's someone like that.
Mikal.
It's the family from that picture.
TRAGEDY STRIKES AGAIN
Look.
HOTEL OF EVIL
If this place has been closed
for over 30 years...
What about this?
And everything in those shelves.
And all of this.
This isn't 30 years old.
Let's get out of here.
Son of a bitch...
Hello?
Ingunn?
Darling?
Mikal has made breakfast for you.
Morten Tobias?
He desperately wants to talk to you.
It's all been a...
Morten?
Help me up!
Christ, you scared me.
-I woke up. No friends to be seen.
No food.
I declared war on a tin can, and lost.
Hi...
What's the matter?
-Ingunn.
What is it?
What the hell?
We're alone here.
We're miles away from anyone.
What is it?
What is it?
We have to get out of here.
This way!
Wait!
Come on!
Hang on.
What's going on?
-Someone lives in the cellar.
He's collected things.
-What kind of things?
Not the kind of things
people leave behind.
What do we do now?
-Wait.
For what? For him to get us too?
-For Eirik to bring help!
Mikal, can you please sit still?
No one can hear this.
-I hear it.
Mikal, please.
-Shut up!
He can see you!
-Sit down, idiot.
Where is Eirik?
We can't just sit here.
What if Ingunn needs help?
Jesus Christ!
Idiot!
What did you say?
-She's been chopped to pieces!
What did you say?!
Calm down!
OK?
I'm going to look for her.
Mikal, do you really
think she's alive?
It was my fault.
I should never have left her.
Wait.
Ingunn?
Ingunn?
Shit!
Can you hear anything?
-No.
Open up!
Let me in!
Come on!
What's going on?
Did you see anyone?
This won't do.
Tell us what's going on!
What the fuck...?
What was that?
He could easily
have broken down that door.
We have to get out of here.
Find some skis, or...
What about my leg?
We can get away, Jannicke.
He's doomed anyway.
There must be another way.
-What?
He's the size of a house,
with a huge pickaxe!
Jannicke...
-We can hide in another room.
Go ahead.
-If you leave, we don't stand a chance!
We don't stand a chance anyway.
Mikal!
We'll be OK.
Jannicke...
I don't want to die!
You aren't going to die.
I'm going to leave you...
-No!
I'll be right back!
-No!
Morten, look at me.
You'll be fine.
Everything will be OK.
Everything will be OK.
Here. Read this.
Memorize the entire label. OK?
Jannicke.
I have to tell you something.
I...
I know, Morten.
Son of a bitch!
That's good.
Shit!
Morten, it's me!
Is it loaded?
-Yes. And I found a sledge and skis.
Let's go!
-He'll just catch us.
We have the shotgun!
-With one shell!
What if we miss?
Have you fired a shotgun before?
I know what we have to do.
We'll lure him down here,
and lock him in.
Is there no other way out?
-I don't think so.
Come on!
Ready?
What are you doing?
Flash if he comes back.
Hi.
-Eirik!
What's going on?
-We have to go!
Where am I?
-We have to get out of here!
I found your keys.
We have to go!
We have to get out!
We have to go now!
Lie perfectly still.
Don't move.
Shoot him!
It worked.
It worked!
Come on! Let's go!
-Eirik's in there.
Eirik's in there.
-Eirik?
I couldn't get him out.
-Eirik?
What the hell?
Why...?
OK...
What do we do now?
Jannicke, what do we do now?
-Lure the bastard out and shoot him.
OK.
Give me the shotgun.
I'll shoot him.
OK?
I'll do it.
No!
Jannicke...
Jannicke!
Wait.
Don't move.
Jannicke, get out of here.
Go, Jannicke.
Go.
Go.
Go, Jannicke.
You just stay right there, OK?
Don't move.
I mean it.
I'll blow your brains out!
Don't move!
Fuck!
No!
