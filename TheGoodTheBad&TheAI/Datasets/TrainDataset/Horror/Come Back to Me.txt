No!
Please, let me go, Jimmy!
Man: You're not going anywhere.
You're staying here with me,
ain't ya?!
Get back here!
I said get back in here!
Woman: You're very high.
You're scaring me.
Man: Oh, I'm high?
Oh, really?
Woman: Please, I'll take Dale,
and we'll stay at my mom's.
You're not going anywhere,
bitch!
You always run away, you're
always runnin' somewhere.
I know it's worse this time.
You wanna go watch?
Suit yourself.
Stay here.
Man: ...That little freak?
That little piece of shit?!
I ain't certain he's mine!
Is he?
Is that little fucking
freak mine?!
Did you fuck around on me?!
Who you been fucking
around with?
You're hurting me!
Help me.
Come here.
Put the knife down!
Get on the ground!
Drop it!
Drop the knife!
Drop the knife!
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!
Freeze!
Go, go, go!
Hey, kid, what's your name?
Dale.
Dale, you okay?
Is your mom inside?
Stay here.
Reno P.D.,
entering premises.
Police, coming in.
Stay there.
This is unit 610.
Code 999.
Shots fired,
requesting backup.
Did you hear that,
mama?
I think they got him.
It's gonna be
all right now.
Mama?
Shit.
Well, this is
a disaster.
What are you doing up?
I was gonna make you
breakfast in bed.
Well, you've gotta
get it on the plate first.
Ha ha ha.
Besides, I haven't quite worked
up an appetite yet anyway.
Um, well,
what about pancakes?
You can lick butter
and syrup off me.
I like it.
Uh, did you notice someone new
just moved in across the street?
Really? That's what you're
thinking about right now?
Yeah, thought we could go
introduce ourselves before
I go to work.
Okay.
What?
Nothing.
I just, I don't have time
right now.
Oh, but you have time
to meet the new neighbor.
Sarah...
Look, it's fine.
It's fine.
I'll be down in a sec.
Okay.
Sarah: He's home, right?
I think that's his car
in the driveway.
Hi, we live
across the street.
Thought we'd come and
introduce ourselves.
I'm Josh and
this is my wife, Sarah.
Hi.
Dale.
Dale.
Are these for me?
Yeah, welcome to the hood.
Did you make them?
No, I'd be lying
if I said I did.
So you didn't
make them?
No, they're from a packet.
It's the thought
that counts.
Great house you got here.
Probably rented it
for a steal, huh?
With the economy and all.
Is everything okay?
Sorry.
It's just that you remind me
of someone.
So, what is it that
you do, Josh?
Croupier over on--
I work on the strip.
Yeah, no, Sarah's the brains
in this relationship.
She's just finished
grad school
and is working on
her dissertation,
the sociological effects
of Internet pornography on
modern relationships.
Or something
like that.
Yeah, she's going for
her doctorate
in social science
and already has
an offer from UNLV.
You know what, Josh?
Maybe we should let Dale go,
don't you think?
Right, of course.
Sorry, listen to me.
Anyway, great to
meet you, Dale.
And we'll...
See you around.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, my God, Leslie.
I can feel him kicking.
How do you know
it's a him?
Oh, no girl could be
that cruel.
I know what you're
thinking, smart ass.
I didn't say anything.
Okay, wait,
what was it, again?
You've slept with
two guys since your divorce?
One was black, one was Korean,
so when this one comes out,
it won't take a genius
to do the math.
Right, right.
Black, Korean,
it is all extremes with you.
One was probably too big,
one was probably too small.
No shit.
That Korean was hung
like an elephant.
He'll come around.
You'll see.
I know, I just...
I don't know,
I want him to be
ready, too, you know?
Oh, my God.
Buster!
Buster, come here!
That scares the shit
out of me every time.
Best watch dog a girl
could ever have, aren't you?
Do you want
some more tea?
No, I should get
this one home.
Right, and yeah,
I should get
some work done.
But it's Sunday,
a day of rest.
I'll rest when
I'm dead.
Hi, Sarah.
It's, uh, Dale.
Oh, of course, Dale.
I'm sorry.
I'm a little
out of it today.
So, how long have you
been working here?
Um, I just transferred
from the other super a.
Clerk: 72.80.
Let me help you
out to your car.
Dale, this really
isn't necessary.
Oh, that's your car,
right?
Yeah.
Oh, here, let me
get it for you.
Thank you.
This is really
nice of you.
Please.
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm your neighbor,
just take it. Not a stranger.
No, no, no.
I'm your neighbor,
not a stranger.
Okay, thank you.
Oh, Dale?
Shoot.
I'd forget my head
if it wasn't screwed on.
Thank you.
Bye.
And river...
Whoo hoo.
She's a winner.
Sorry, sucker.
You're on a roll.
You're my lucky charm.
Thank you.
And that's my cue.
Uh-oh.
Can I buy you a drink?
Uh, it's a casino, Helen.
Drinks are free.
So am I.
Bye, Helen.
All yours.
What's that,
your retirement fund?
Yeah, fucking day shift.
Welfare checks only, please.
I know, man.
But you wanna grab lunch?
I got the good stuff.
C'mon, Johnny,
you know I can't
do that shit anymore.
Besides, I got another one
of those appointments.
Wow.
Wow, okay.
Well, you're a determined
son of a bitch,
I'll give you that.
Shot for luck?
Nah, nah, nah,
come on.
On the house.
Thank you.
Sarah: You do wanna have
a baby with me, don't you?
I mean, starting a family,
it's a big deal.
I guess I just need
a little more time.
It's only been like the
last couple of months
since your accident that we've
even talked about it.
I got a second shot, babe.
I don't wanna waste
any more time.
I want to make
every moment count.
So, let's go skydiving.
Sarah: Hello?
Josh: Hey, babe,
it's me.
Shouldn't you be home?
I know, I'm sorry,
I haven't been able
to call 'til now.
Um, I am gonna rest up here
for a couple of hours
and take another shift.
Really?
Yeah, I mean, I wanna take
as many as I can right now.
You know--
night shifts mean
bigger tips.
I get it.
I mean, I don't like it,
but I get it.
Look, as soon as I am finished
with this God damn thesis,
I will start
contributing again,
I swear.
No, it's not that.
I mean...
I think it's time we started to
save for the future.
I mean, who knows what
that may bring, right?
Uh, yeah.
Okay, listen, hon,
I gotta go.
You sure you're
all right with this?
Yeah, no, I'm fine,
of course.
Go.
Okay, I'll see you
in the morning.
Love you.
There you are.
I'm glad you made it.
How you doin'?
Good, how are you?
I'm good.
Look at you.
You are just gorgeous.
And when I saw you in that
club the other day,
I just had to have you...
Great ass...
Dale, what a pleasant surprise.
Really?
How can I help you?
Ta-da!
All gone.
The cookies.
They were delicious.
I'm glad you
enjoyed them.
Well, at first, I was
a little upset because
they're not homemade
because homemade's better,
right?
But then I took my first bite,
and I didn't stop until
I finished.
Well, I better get back...
Right.
You have things
to do.
Good night.
Oh, just one more thing.
What was the brand, again?
Of the cookies?
Um, Rainbridge Farm.
Right, Rainbridge Farm.
I'm gonna pick some of those up
at work tomorrow.
Okay.
Good night, Dale.
To the extent that the
consumption of Internet
pornography
is a factor subverting
family life,
it harms not only those affected
immediately by the user,
but also by the wider society,
as well, as empirical research
testifies, to the relationship
between family stability and the
desirable individual and social
outcomes.
It was awful.
I mean, I woke up
hyperventilating, disoriented.
My heart was racing like
a million Miles a minute.
Pavor nocturnus.
Excuse me?
Night terrors.
They're most common with kids,
but not uncommon with adults,
especially those experiencing
stress or a recent traumatic
episode.
I'd say you fit into both
categories, don't you think?
Look, they're not dangerous,
but what you do during them
can be.
Using kitchen appliances,
walking into things.
I mean, people have been known
to jump out of windows
in their sleep.
Wow, I guess I should feel
lucky all I did was change
my top.
I remember a while back,
I was experiencing
something similar.
Waking at odd hours,
panicking with this
strange feeling.
Anyway, my therapist thought it
probably had something to do
with my divorce.
I was feeling unsafe,
unprotected.
That is why I adopted Buster.
And?
He must've been right.
I've felt fine ever since.
Are you saying
that's how I feel?
Unprotected?
I'm saying you want something
Josh may not wanna give you.
And your subconscious
may be reacting to that.
This should relax you.
One before bed.
Thank you.
Oh, Jesus, babe.
Babe, you scared me.
You all right?
I don't know.
There.
Better?
Thank you.
So, you saw Leslie about
these things?
These, um...
What did you
call them?
Night terrors.
Ooh, sounds ominous.
She said they're
not dangerous,
but it's what you can do
to yourself while
you're asleep that can be.
Like spilling wine
on your clothes and
taking them off?
Yeah, pretty lethal.
I don't think
it was wine, Josh.
Okay, I'm sorry.
What else?
When I woke up,
I smelled cleaning products.
Okay, well, um,
I'm gonna call in sick tonight.
No, you don't have
to do that.
I know I don't
have to do it.
I want to.
Who is it?
Uh, work.
So, uh, I'm gonna tell them that
I'm not coming in tonight,
and you just relax.
Hello?
Yes, speaking.
Oh, you have
the results already.
That was quick.
No, no, now's
a good time.
Uh huh.
So, that's it, then.
No, thank you.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm just tired
is all.
Tell me about it.
So, why don't you stop
work and join me?
Give me a half hour.
I'm kind of on a roll
at the moment.
All right,
see you soon.

Josh! Josh! Josh!
Josh!
Josh!
Josh?
Josh!
Josh! Josh!
Josh! Josh!
Oh.
Oh, Jesus.
What time
is it?
What's...
What's going on?
What is going on?
I think we must've
fallen asleep.
Whoa.
Honey?
Whoa, honey.
Honey?
Honey, it's okay,
it's okay.
It's fine, okay?
It's fine.
I think I remember...
I thought I...
Didn't I--
I remember-- what?
Hey, Sarah,
Sarah, Sarah!
God, why can't
I fucking remember?!
You're really freaking
me out now, okay?
Just, please,
just calm down.
Calm down,
calm down.
Calm down, okay?
What happened?
How did my phone
get cracked?
What is happening?!
There's nothing--
there's nothing wrong,
okay? It's fine.
What's happening?!
It's fine,
it's fine.
God, it's fine.
Baby...
It's been two weeks,
Les.
Passing out,
waking up,
having flashes of nightmares
I can't fully remember.
We could try
changing pills.
No, no more pills.
What's the point,
anyway?
At least my place
is clean.
What?
When I wake up, it smells like
I've been cleaning in my sleep.
What?
Nothing.
Look, why don't you
record yourself?
Set up a camera. What?
Get a better sense
of what you're doing
in your sleep.
Monitor your patterns.
Can I show
you something?
Uh, sure.
I haven't even shown
this to Josh.
Look.
At what?
Exactly.
My scar,
where my head hit
the steering wheel...
It's gone.
Like it
never existed.
Scars fade, Sarah.
Really?
They fade completely
and after only 3 months?
No.
What is happening
to me?
Jesus Christ,
that damn dog.
Sorry.
Buster, come here.
Not yet,
not yet.
Ready, ready, ready?
Okay, okay.
Open.
Oh, my fucking God.
How did you get this?
Oh, I made a few calls,
called in a few favors.
This is ours
for a week.
A week? Yeah.
Wait, how did you do that?
What are we gonna do
in a week?
Um...
Everything.
Oh, everything.
Yeah.
Everything.
I can't breathe
without you
I can't breathe
without you
I can't breathe
without you
Hi.
Hi.
Did you sleep well?
Like the dead.
No night terrors?
No.
Oh, must be the change
of scenery, then.
I could stay here
forever.
Housekeeping.
Or until she comes.
Come back in a week.
It was the best,
Leslie.
A week of pampering,
laying by the pool,
and finally,
some peaceful sleeping.
I guess I was just
stressed out after all,
you know?
Shit, Leslie,
let me call you back.
Oh, God.
I am so not in the mood.
Please don't come over,
please don't come over.
Shit.
Hey, Dale.
Hi, Sarah.
Can I help you
with something?
Where have
you been?
Excuse me?
This last week,
where have you been?
That's none
of your business.
Sorry, I was just
worried about you.
Is everything okay?
Everything's fine,
thank you.
Good, good.
Is there
anything else?
Oh, no, sorry.
I'll see you later,
Sarah.
Shoot, Dale.
You'd forget your head
if it wasn't screwed on.
Oh, Dale.
Shoot.
I'd forget my head
if it wasn't screwed on.
What?
Okay, look to the left.
Good.
To the right.
Looks fine.
And there's no sign
of a wound.
No.
Do you have
a headache?
I don't know.
So, this wasn't
a night terror, but a--
I don't know,
I don't know.
A black out?
Take your time.
I don't fucking know,
Les.
I mean, I...
I think I went to go out
for a run and then...
I don't know, I'm waking up
on the couch in the other room.
Do you remember
falling over?
Look, even if I did,
how did I end up there?
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Not again.
I'd come and hold you hair back,
but I'm a sympathetic vomiter.
Sarah, you okay?
What the fuck
is going on?
A repercussion from
the car accident, maybe?
Let's see the neurologist
again, get an MRI.
Just give me
a moment.
Yeah.
Here, this'll
calm your nerves.
I'm pregnant.
You don't seem
too thrilled.
I just can't
believe it.
That's how I
first felt.
Congratulations.
I guess so.
You guess so?
Come on, this is what
you wanted, right?
Hey, I'm sure Josh'll
be over the moon.
Give me a call
when you feel better.
I'll do a blood test
to confirm the good news.
Hey, Dale.
Hi, Sarah.
Look, I know this may
seem weird, but
have you been home
all day?
Did you see me go for a run
or anything?
You didn't see
me fall?
Are you okay?
I don't know.
Dale?
Oh, hello, Dr. Dell.
You two know
each other?
Dale used to deliver
my groceries until...
Why did you stop?
I don't like dogs.
Ah, Buster.
Sorry to bother you,
Dale.
Bye, Dale.
Just go in and tell him.
I often get told there's a hot
babe waiting for me at the bar,
but none of them
are this smokin'.
Oh, I think we can do
much better than that.
Johnny, something a little
stronger for my lady friend.
Come on,
I can't, Josh. Tequila.
I already tried, bud.
Josh...
I can't.
Wha--
are you?
See you soon, Paul.
It's all right, babe.
I'll see myself out.
Are you sure
you're okay?
Yeah, yeah, just...
Surprised.
Yeah, that's what happens
when a man--
yeah, I get how
it works.
I love you
so much.
I'll see you
at home.
Shot of whiskey.
Listen, listen, man,
I know what you're thinking--
just...
Just keep
'em coming.
Josh?
Oops, sorry.
Jesus Christ,
Josh.
What, you didn't hear
me calling out?
I mean, what are you even
doing home?
Did something
happen at work?
Talk to me.
Okay, fine, well can
you at least clean up
the broken glass?
In college, like everyone else,
I was up for some extra cash.
Some buddies of mine were
getting beer money
by donating their...
So, I gave it
a shot.
But I was politely
turned away.
Apparently, my count was...
Zero.
I've wanted so badly
to tell you.
You know, when we were staying
at the casino and
well, since we've been married.
And I've seen every fucking
specialist around,
but the diagnosis
is always the same:
"Hey, sorry, kid,
you're shootin' blanks."
But, you can't be.
Oh, well,
there's the thing.
I'm sterile,
and you're pregnant.
Now, I'm no Einstein,
but you know, I can add
that one up.
I don't want to know
whose it is or how long
it's been going on.
I just, I...
Wait!
Wait, what is going on?
Well, that's what I'd like
to know, Sarah,
but I really
don't wanna hear it.
You're leaving me?!
What did
you expect?!
Sarah!
What, do you want me to sit
around and rejoice the fact
that you're cheating on me?
I could never--
oh, well, then what
is this, huh?
Immaculate conception?
Josh, don't go.
No, I should've
expected this.
Yeah, what with you sitting
around watching that
nasty shit all day.
Look, okay, you're drunk,
you can't drive.
Oh, I'm gonna drink
a shitload more
until I pass out,
hopefully wake up, and all
this is some fucking nightmare.
What the fuck
is happening?!
You got what
you wanted.
That's what's
happening.
No, no,
Josh, please!
Leave me alone.
Hi, you've reached
Josh McClaren.
Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.
Josh?
It's me.
I'm coming over.
No, please,
I'm fine.
You're not.
You sounded terrible today.
You shouldn't
be alone.
Look, I'm not gonna
be much company.
Never thought
you were.
See you soon.
Okay, in ya go.
That's it.
How many of those
pills did you have?
Good, Buster,
you stay there.
Okay, in ya go.
There you go.
We'll be right here,
okay?
Thank you.
That's it,
just relax.
Okay.
You good, Buster?
Jesus, Buster.
It's okay,
go back to sleep.
Buster, come here.
Buster.
Buster, shh!
Buster, come on,
seriously.
Shh!
Josh, is that you?
It's Leslie.
Buster!
Come, buddy.
Buster.
Buster!
Buster?!
Come on,
come on, buddy.
Leslie?
Leslie?
Is that Buster?
Buster, Buster!
Come here, buddy.
Come here.
Why is the door open?
Buster!
Buster, come in,
buddy.
Buster!
Sarah!
What?
Sarah?
There's a beautiful baby
boy waiting to meet you.
Thank you.
Hey.
Congratulations!
Let me take a look
at the little man.
I guess I don't know who
the father is, after all.
Beer?
I gotta go
to work, man.
Come on, you're a bartender,
you're not a brain surgeon.
I thought you were gonna
go home last night.
Didn't know
what to say.
Well, "let's talk" is
usually a good place to start.
Shit, man, stop being
such a pussy.
Yeah, she's your wife,
for Christ sake.
I mean, even that ought to
entitle her to a civil hearing.
Pretty sure you lose that right
when you fuck someone else.
Oh, come on.
Seriously, get off
your high horse, all right?
'Cause it's not like
you've been honest with her,
is it?
Look, man,
I might just be some
cocktail-slinging stoner, right?
But even I believe good things
happen to good people.
You thought you were shooting
blanks, right?
It only takes one little
swimmer to make a baby.
You let Sarah go without a
fight,
you're more of a fuck-up
than I am.
Think about that.
Go take a shower, change out of
that stinking uniform,
and please, hey, please,
at least give her a call.
Hello?
It's me.
Hey, how are you?
I wanna leave already.
For a doctor,
I really hate hospitals.
How's the little one?
He's good.
I think you should
stay at my place tonight.
I can't.
Please.
I don't know what's going on,
but I sure as hell don't think
you should be at your place
on your own.
Exactly. I don't know what's
going on, and I need to find
out, Les.
I'll call you tomorrow,
okay?
Just like the last time...
Shh.
Shh, it'll be just
like last time.
You didn't like
my other music,
so maybe this will
relax you.
Dale?
Would you like
to dance?
Rainbridge Farms.
You introduced me
to these, remember?
Can't stay long tonight.
But I can't wait to see you
again tomorrow.
I really love
our time together.
I think you're
the one.
I'm dead?
I'm dead?
I'm fucking dead?
He killed me?
He killed me?
Impossible.
He killed you.
I just saw him
kill you.
What is this?
This is what's been happening
since he moved in.
You've gotta go
to the police.
And tell them what?
My fucking neighbor
is killing me?
You've got it
all on tape.
I'm alive, Leslie.
If I go to the police,
they're gonna think it's fake.
That it's a joke,
that I doctored it somehow,
special effects.
I'm a hundred percent normal.
Perfectly healthy.
No signs of trauma
anywhere.
He breathed
into me.
He just breathed
into me.
And it all
went away.
Every cut,
every scar.
Let me show
you something.
I did multiple searches trying
to figure out what the fuck was
going on.
Dale plus bring back the dead,
Dale plus resurrection,
Dale plus back to life.
And then I found this.
This is what the first cop
on the scene said.
"I saw her body.
It was everywhere.
"It made me sick.
"There's no way she could've
been alive.
It's like she was somehow
brought back to life."
And the only other person
in the house...
Was the woman's
Dale.
And then I found this.
She's a patient at the Nevada
state mental institution.
Jesus, Sarah,
what are you doing?
I'm gonna find out who
the fuck my neighbor is.
Be careful, okay?
Please.
You have a baby
to think about, remember?
It's not Josh's.
Remember a while back, I was
experiencing something similar.
Waking at odd hours, panicking
with this strange feeling.
That is why I adopted Buster.
Dale used to deliver
my groceries until...
Why did you stop?
I don't like dogs.
I heard you the first
ten times.
I'm sorry, I'm just a little--
look, I need to see
Eileen Wallace.
Excuse me?
Eileen Wallace.
It's urgent.
Do you have
an appointment?
No, I was just hoping--
not without
an appointment.
Look, fuck the appointment,
okay? I need to see her,
and I'm not gonna leave here
until I do.
Yeah, I'm sorry to bother you,
Dr. Simmons, but I have a...
Sarah, Sarah McClaren
Sarah McClaren.
She's here to see Ms. Wallace.
About what?
Her son.
This is highly irregular,
Mrs. McClaren, but
it was her decision.
I told her what you look like,
and she agreed to talk to you.
So, I see you do one thing
to upset her,
I'll have you outta there so
fast, it'll make your head spin.
Ready?
Mrs. McClaren,
this is Eileen.
Ten minutes.
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Wallace.
I wouldn't think so.
Not under such...
Circumstances.
Dr. Simmons told me
what you look like.
Pretty.
Blond.
Dale, has a type,
you see.
I guess it reminds him
of me.
He recently moved across
from us, and...
I have proof he's been
coming into our house.
Murdering you?
It's what he does...
Ever since he was
since he first discovered
his gift.
The night my
husband killed me...
You hear that, mama?
I think they got him.
It's gonna be
all right now.
Mama?
Kid?
Dale, come on, man.
Where you at?
Dale?
What the fuck?
Get down!
Get away
from the boy!
Get the fuck
away from the boy!
It's okay,
this is my mom.
I couldn't
remember a thing.
Jesus Christ.
Later, at the hospital
once I was told I was
perfectly healthy,
Dale told me he just
breathed into my mouth
like he saw on TV.
After that...
He became obsessed
with his ability.
He's not right.
He's not right
in the head.
He's got the
holy spirit in him.
But look what he does
with it--
mama,
please.
I find knives and
clothes in his room
keep your voice down.
With blood on them.
You see? You see?
You're afraid of him, too.
Stop talking
this way, mama
Dale is not evil.
He's just a boy.
And God help us all when
he becomes a man.
Come back to me.
Nothing, no one was safe.
No!
Dale!
Stop that!
You stop that
right now!
You have got to stop
doing this!
Why? I always bring
them back.
Back off, mama!
You want me
to start killing you?
Bring her back.
Please?
It's time for you
to bring her back.
Make me cookies first.
Now!
Bring her
back now, Dale.
For mama.
You promised.
I couldn't take it
anymore.
I couldn't live knowing
that Dale came from me,
that I was
somehow responsible...
For creating a monster.
But whatever I did
to get away...
He always brought
me back.
Come back to me.
No.
No!
No!
Why do you wanna
leave me, mama?
I need you,
I love you.
You can kill yourself
again and again,
but I will always
bring you back!
You can't leave me.
I knew what
I had to do.
Please, you can't
ever leave me.
After all, desperate times
call for drastic measures.
Mrs. Wallace,
Mrs. Wallace.
Mrs. Wallace,
you need a--
put it down!
Put that down,
Mrs. Wallace!
don't do this!
don't do that,
Mrs. Wallace!
If I didn't die
that day,
I was hoping for
the next best thing...
To end up here
where he could no longer
get to me.
But it seems there was only
one way to stop him,
so why didn't you just--
kill him?
You must not have kids,
or you would know
the answer to that.
Dale never really
grew up.
Once he discovered
what he could do,
he never
developed socially.
Why would he?
He used his gift
to get the girls.
Killing
and bringing you back,
that's how
he connects.
That's how
he loves.
If this has been
going on for a while,
you must be
very special to him.
But how...
How does he do
what he does?
That is one of life's
cruel ironies.
I mean,
why would God give
a Christ-like gift
to the very devil himself?
I know where
you can get a gun.
You find him in
your home again,
you do what you
have to do to stop him.
Please.
Promise me
you'll stop him.
Shit.
You've reach
Josh McClaren...
Josh, Josh,
it's me.
Listen, I need
to see you, okay?
I know what's
been going on.
I have proof, and I just
visited--just listen,
don't leave Johnny's,
and call me back, okay?
don't go home!
Please, whatever you do,
don't go home!
Fuck!
Sarah?
Sarah?
Sarah?
Sarah?
Josh?
Josh?
No, no, no!
Josh, no!
No, no,
stay with me!
Hi, Sarah.
Welcome home.
You wanna shoot
me, too?
That's not fair.
It's not like
you can bring me back.
Dale, can you please--
please bring
him back?
But I didn't
kill him, Sarah.
Bring him back!
You did.
No, I won't!
Do you hear me?!
Never, ever!
He doesn't deserve you!
It's better
this way.
I heard you two
fighting the other night.
I was here.
He's mean.
He left you.
He doesn't wanna take
care of you anymore.
I don't wanna
kill you again, Sarah.
I'm just so tired
from all of the...
The cleaning.
But don't get
me wrong.
I still want us
to be together.
I want us
to be together
as a family.
Do you want
to be normal, Dale?
You promise?
Are you hungry?
Homemade.
Just the way
you like them.
This is nice.
To us?
Yeah, to us.
I don't have to
use this, do I?
Not if you
don't want to.
Try not to eat
too many. Why?
I don't want you
ruining your appetite.
Let's go upstairs.
What are we doing?
What do
you think?
But--
but what?
You want to,
don't you?
You want it
to be normal, right?
Yeah, of course, but
normally, you can't remember
anything afterwards.
I want to remember, Dale.
I want to remember
everything that happens
between us.
That's what being a real
couple is all about.
Trust me.
What if you think
that I'm really-- shh.
You're gonna
be perfect.
Do you like
the way I look, Dale?
Do you like
my eyes?
My lips?
My hair?
My breasts?
Yeah, they're the best.
Kiss me, Dale.
Kiss me, Dale.
Kiss me, now!
You're tricking me.
Get up.
Ahh!
Come back to me!
Liar, liar, liar!
You're just
like mama!
You wanna
leave me, too.
Well, you're not
going to.
'Cause I'm gonna
leave you first!
What the fuck
is going on?!
Come here.
I think it's time
you both die...
For the last time.
Come back
to me.
