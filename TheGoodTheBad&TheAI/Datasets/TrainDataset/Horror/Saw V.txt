Fuck! Fuck!
What the f...!
Fuck!
What the fuck!
Fuck!
God!
Help!
Fuck!
Hello Seth.
I want to play a game.
Right now you´re feeling helpless.
This is the same helplesness
you bestowed onto others.
But now, it's onto you.
Some would call this karma,
I call it justice.
Now you served five years
of what should have been
a life sentence, for murder.
A technicality gave you freedom,
but it inhibited you from understanding
the impact of taking a life.
Today, I offer you true freedom.
In thirty seconds,
the pendulum will drop far enough
to touch your body.
Within sixty seconds, it will cut you in half.
To avoid the pendulum, all you have to do
is destroy the things that have killed...
...your hands.
You must insert your hands
and push the buttons
to start the devices before you.
Your bones will be crushed to dust.
Will you destroy the things that have
taken life in order to save one, Seth?
Make your choice.
No!
It was an accident!
God!
Please!
Wait!
Ok, fuck you!
God!
Ok, ok, ok.
Come on, come on...
Fuck!
I did it! I did it!
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands!
Where is my daughter?
You...
Jesus.
Hello, Agent Strahm.
If you're hearing this, then you've finally found
what you've been looking for.
But is the discovery of my body enough?
Or will your insatiable hunger to uncover the truth
push you deeper into the abyss?
Heed my warning: do not proceed.
For this room can either be you sanctuary,
or it can be your grave.
The choice is yours.
Fuck you.
Hey!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Go, go!
It´s ok.
Lets go.
Move it, move, move!
Stay focused!
- Wheres my dad?
- Its gonna be ok.
Wheres my mum?
Wheres my mum?
- Hoffman.
- I got him.
Did you get them all?
What the hell happened?
Where is Rigg?
I tried to help.
He didnt make it.
Nobody made it.
We got a live one!
Hello?
Right away.
Miss Tuck.
Have a seat.
Its nice to meet you Mr. Feldman.
Why am I here?
I represent your ex-husband John.
In the event of his death,
I was instructed to contact you.
You can understand my surprise, when I found out,
who he really was.
John left something for you.
If youre watching this Jill,
Im long gone from this world.
You are my heart, you always have been,
you always will be.
Im not going to try to explain the...
...my actions of leave.
Suffice it to say that I find it difficult
to forgive myself
for what happened at the clinic.
I permited, indeed encouraged
your decisions
regarding the people there.
I saw a danger and I should have acted sooner.
Im leaving you a box today
and its contents are of grave importance.
Even though you and I dont always see
eye on eye on everything
I deeply believe in you
and I believe, that you will know
what to do with these materials.
Miss Tuck, if you dont mind,
whats in the box?
Thank you for your time Mr. Feldman.
I want to thank you all
for coming here today
and Id like to be the first to say
that the Jigsaw murders are over.
Why isnt this a joint press conference with the FBI?
Please not today miss Jenkins.
The officers who gave their lives
are being honored here today.
But today Id like to offer special honor
to the detective, who has been on this case
right from the beginning.
Who proved through hard work and dedication
that the people who died
did not die in vain.
Today we honor the newly promoted
detective lieutenant Mark Hoffman.
?Hes all right. God bless him.?
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Throughout this ordeal, if we´ve learnt anything,
its that...
...human life is sacred.
And we´ve learnt that every day.
Life should be cherished.
Justice is the backbone to every peacefull society.
And I believe that true justice has been served.
Doctor Rayburn, 53.
Doctor Rayburn...
Sorry about agent Perez.
Shouldnt you be resting?
Im fine Erickson.
?Knock it out Peter.?
Thats why I put you on medical leave.
I was supposed to die in that trap.
You never should have been there without back-up.
I want to talk to Jill Tuck one last time.
Youre not longer handling the case, Peter.
What?
Read it.
Over a dozen dead bodies
were recovered at the scene.
Two of which were cops.
Jigsaw is dead.
How many lives did I inevitably save?
By endangering yourself and others
- ...you are off the case.
- On whose orders?
Mine.
Im sorry Peter, its over.
Hello agent Perez and welcome to the world,
that you have long studied.
Heed my warning agent Perez.
Your next move is critical.
- Open the door.
- What is that?
I am truly sorry about agent Perez.
She said your name you know...
Last thing she said wais "detective Hoffman".
Why did she said that?
Why did she say your name?
- I dont know.
- No?
How did you walk out of that building?
How did you?
On a gurney, with a fucking hole in my throat!
And you...
couple of scratches, and a story about
how your arm straps broke. Jigsaw doesn't make mistakes.
Is this you theorising again?
Cause Jigsaw is dead.
Im not talking about him.
Im talking about you and your whole crooked department.
My department is gone.
They are all dead.
Theres no one left
Besides you.
Ive been chasing Jigsaw from the beginning.
And I got him.
So unless youve got something else to say...
...back the fuck off.
And read the papers.
I saved that little girl.
Oh my god.
What is this?
Hey, dont move.
What did you do to me?
I didnt do anything.
Its Jigsaw.
- What is it?
- I knew this was going to happen to me.
This is what he does.
No it is not Jigsaw.
He is dead.
Havent you watched TV lately?
Yeah, well whoever it is.
Theyre watching us.
Make sure, we follow the rules.
Which are what?
I wouldnt do that if I were you.
Unless you want your head to pop off
like a dendelion.
How do you know that?
Because I have eyes.
One pulled pin starts the timer for all of us.
You dont want to do that,
unless you know how it works now, would you?
This shit is freakin' me out, dude.
Hello and welcome.
From birth, you've all given
the advantages of few others.
Yet, through poor moral decisions,
you've used these advantages to selfishly
futher only yourselves at the expense of others.
Well today, this singular way of thinking
will be put to the test.
Today, five will become one
with the common goal of survival.
You are all connected.
A cable runs through your collar devices.
It can be pulled so tight that you
will be decapitated on the mounted razors.
The only way to remove the collar is with the keys
from the glass boxes on the pedastals before you.
However, if one of you moves to retrieve a key,
the 60-second timer will begin for you all.
In choosing how to react to the situation,
your life-long instincts will tell you to do one thing,
but I implore you to do the opposite.
Let the games begin.
Somebody has to die.
No, no, it says don't listen to your instincts.
- That means don't go for the keys.
- Are you fucking nuts?
How are we supposed to live
if we don't go for the keys?
Maybe it's testing our endurance.
We've got to move back.
That timer is connected to those jars.
No, it didn't say anything about those jars.
It could be nothing
They're a nail-bomb.
Home-made. Probably C4.
How the fuck do you know that?
She's a fire inspector.
She's seen all kinds of demented shit.
How do you know me?
Hey, man, she's asking you a question.
How do you know her?
How do you know her?!
- Answer me!
- Look, let's just keep our cool.
- Maybe we can figure this out.
- We're all here for a reason.
We're all connected.
That's what the message said.
- What did you do?
- You go first.
It, it, it said we were all born with advantages, right?
Me was born for money.
- I'm not.
- And neither have I.
Nice fucking try, Nancy Drew.
Well, then what does it mean?
We all did something wrong
with the advantage we were given from birth.
That doesnt have to mean money.
What are you not telling us?
Huh? You know about her.
What do you know about the rest of us?
- Would you fucking talk to me?!
- Relax.
- I am fucking relaxed!
- It's a game, tweeker! Get it?
The less you know about me, the better.
The reason why you fucked up your charm existences
is pretty obvious to everyone, isn't it?
Fuck you.
Fuck you!
Been play with matches again, have we?
Fuck all of you!
?You fucking queer!?
Not yet!
Unless you wanna be shredded when
those nail-bombs go off, I suggest we move on.
What are you doing?
Being smart.
Special agent Strahms office.
This is detective Hoffman.
Is agent Strahm available?
He is not, but i can connect you
to special agent Erickson.
- Hes handling all enquiries.
- Please.
You have reached the voicemail box of
special agent Erickson. Please leave a message.
Yeah, this is detective Hoffman.
I needed to discuss something with agent Strahm,
but I cant seem to track him down.
Could you give me a call?
It would be greatly appreciated.
There you are.
....
...
...
...
Peter.
- Cowan, take it to Alistair.
- Right away sir.
What do you do here?
Just grabbing some stuff from the office.
Im taking your advice.
Taking some time-off, huh?
Yeah, well I have to heal up, you know?
You know? Ill keep in touch.
Ill see you around.
Hoffman weve got another body.
Looks like another Jigsaw victim.
Youre after this?
Yeah.
Typical ??? murder convict. Served five years,
just released last month.
I know him.
His name is Seth Baxter.
My sisters ex-boyfriend.
This is the guy that murdered your sister?
He was sentenced to 25 years.
They reduced it to 5 on a technicality.
Well Id say justice was served.
You killed him.
Made it look like Jigsaw trap.
I got you.
Not yet!
Dont close the door.
It will set off the timer.
- Do you know that for sure?
- Educated guess.
What we need to do is figure out
who everyone is.
- Well, we know the dead woman worked for the fire department.
- Not anymore.
- She got canned a month ago.
- How the fuck do you...how the fuck do you know that?
You're responsible for this sh...!
You had her fucking head cut off!
- I'm closing the door! I'm gonna close the fucking door!
- Be quiet!
Please.
What's your story?
I work for the Department of City Planning.
- Married? Kids?
- No. And no.
Your turn.
Youre not gonna tell them about daddy?
My dad is... Richard Gibbs.
You remember the Cougars?
He's been trying to build a new stadium for years.
Little did he know all he had to do was
to wait for his daughter to get a job in city planning.
And you? What about you?
What sort of shady shit have you been up to?
I'm a senior VP for a real estate development company.
So you're boring, too.
The Marshford group.
You know you can't get permit in this town
without going to city planning. Right?
- Right?
- No, you cant.
What about you?
No wife, no kids that I know of, no job.
Trust him, baby. Anyone surprised.
I'm so fucking sick of your
self-righteousness, man!
Its your turn.
I'm an investigative journalist for The Herald.
The Harold?
xxx you work for a gossip rag?
Bite your fucking tongue.
What the hell are in those jars?
Let's do this fucking thing before the bombs go off.
Fuck!
Hello and welcome to the next lesson.
These walls hold four chambers.
These chambers offer safety.
However, to access them, a key is needed.
but only three of the keys will fit the locks.
These keys are in the glass jars
hanging from the ceiling.
Move quickly, though.
Because when the clock ticks down,
the explosives in the corners of the room will detonate.
With only three points of safety,
which of you will be the odd man out?
Make your choice.
Fuck!
Fuck its blank.
I need a shape.
Mr.xxx is not going anywhere!
- Stop it!
- Get a clue you fucking bitches! Survival of the fittest!
Blank.
Blank.
Shit.
I got it.
Yes!
Better luck next time you rich boy.
Survival of the fittest my ass.
Wait!
After Seth you were involved in every investigation.
When did you first meet Jigsaw?
OUT OF ORDER
Do you mind ?!
- Going up?
- Yes, thank you.
What story are you going to?
I think were both going to the same place.
You know, why youre here, dont you?
They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
But I find it somewhat... distasteful.
To be given credit for work that's not mine.
...
Especially inferior work.
Like you, I know what it's like to lose family.
I know what it's like not to be able
to protect loved ones.
It's a powerless feeling.
I wouldn't do that.
Hair-trigger.
What do you see?
Vengeance can change a person.
Make you into something you never thought
you were capable of being.
But, unlike you, I've never killed anyone.
I give people a chance.
- You call this a chance?
- We will see.
Our game's just begun.
Our game? You dont even know me.
No.
I know you.
I followed you as you pursued me.
I know you. I know about your sister.
I know how you cared for her.
I know she was your only family.
No!
You sit in bars until closing.
You drink so you can sleep.
You stagger to your car and then you
start it all over again the next day.
And I discovered what you do for recreation.
You can dispense justice.
You can give people a chance
to value their lives in the same moment.
And by the way:
the blade on your pendulum was inferior.
If you want a true edge,
you have to use tempered steel.
Tempering's better for the long haul.
You in this for the long haul, detective?
I've been a cop for 20 years.
Is that long enough for you?
Then you and I both know the statistics
for repeat offenders in this city.
within three years.
What do you want from me?!
So you might look at what you did to Seth
as a kind of public service.
She was my only family.
He didn't deserve a chance!
He was an animal!
Everybody deserves a chance!
You didn't see the blood!
You didn't see what he fucking did to her!
Killing is distasteful...!
To me.
There is a better, more efficient, way.
What do you see? Look!
- What do you see?
- Tell me what you want!
I want to know if you have what it takes to survive.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
You see, it's a different method that I'm talking about.
If the subject survives my method,
he or she is instantly rehabilitated.
Now, you want a chance?
You want a chance?
I'll give you a chance.
I am the man you call "Jigsaw".
It's your duty to bring me in.
But I know who you are
and I know what youve done.
So this is blackmail?
No, no, no...
This is redemption.
Just giving you an option. That's all.
Now, you can arrest me,
but in doing so, your life ends as you know it.
Or...
you could explore
a method of rehabilitation
that'll permit you to sleep at night.
Or I can kill you right now.
But you're not a true killer.
That's your dilemma.
And the information I have on you
is exactly where I needs to be.
And it will be released in the event of my disappearance.
They'll never believe your word over mine.
You're willing to take that risk?
The risk of ruining your own life
in order to protect a corrupt legal system
that puts murderers back on the streets?
How would your sister feel?
We're at a crossroads, detective.
Make your choice.
Did you help Jigsaw get hold of them?
Detective Hoffman,
this is special agent Erickson.
You had something you needed to discuss
about the Jigsaw case?
Yes, I stopped by agent Strahms room tonight
at the hospital, but he wasnt there.
- I hope hes all right.
- Oh yeah, he is fine..
Agent Strahm was theorizing
about the possibility of an additional accomplice to Jigsaw...
...other than Amanda Young.
Someone who might be currently unknown.
Did he ever metioned anything like that to you?
No. But then again, I knew the case.
Yeah, well, maybe you can get him
to contact me at his earliest convience.
Will do. And
in his theorizing,
who exactly did you suspect to be an accomplice?
Well, he suspected someone on the inside.
Someone with access.
That's an interesting theory.
Detective...
what do you say we reconnect in the morning?
You got it.
God. The guy was an asshole but he was smart.
We could have used him.
Well, someone had to die.
Would you rather it have been you?
How did they get you?
I will kill you! I will kill you!
?all right, kill me?
Hello Paul.
Did you cut yourself because you truly wanted to die
or did you just want some attention?
Tonight, you'll show me.
If you want to live, you'll have to cut yourself again.
How much blood will you shed to stay alive, Paul?
I didn't expect to feel any remorse.
The heart cannot be involved.
Emotionally, there can be nothing there.
It can never be personal.
- Lets go.
- No.
Youre not done yet.
Tonight, you will see the difference
between killing and rehabilitation.
There's another detective
that you should be aware of.
His name's Tapp
He's smart. He's getting closer.
I know who he is.
I need you to lead him to somewhere for me.
A doctor.
A healer who needs some healing.
Is this yours, doctor?
You supplied these police files, didnt you?
Youre assuming this is gonna play out
the way you want it?
I assume nothing.
I anticipate the possibilities
and I let the game play out.
Then why do you need Amanda in the game?
To ensure that the rules are followed.
- She won't make decisions for anyone.
- She will just...
...offer choices.
A little to your left.
That leaves it up to chance.
If you're good at anticipating the human mind,
it leaves nothing to chance.
Its time.
Jesus Christ!
Great. More bombs.
All right, what did you do to get here?
I... I did something
...and a bunch of people were killed.
I didnt mean to.
There're still deads.
- And that's why you're here?
- Yeah.
Shouldn't you have gone to jail
for something like that?
Nobody else knows.
Somebody does.
I didn't kill anybody
if that's what you're asking.
I wasnt.
I grant building permits.
And yes, some people might have been more deserving than others.
But you know what? That's the business.
So if someone tells you different,
well then they're just stupid.
Or naive.
Or both.
Bullshit.
You take bribes, you're a fucking liar,
you cheat people. That's not nice.
Yeah...
But I'm sure she's not exactly
Mother Teresa either.
No, Im not.
I don't give a shit. Close the fucking door,
we have to hear the rules.
Hello and welcome.
You must all be eager to learn
the next important lesson in your transformation.
The game before you
is designed to bridge the gap between you all.
In order to open the five locks on the door
out of this room,
the five electrical circuits
powering them must be closed.
The only way to do this is to find a way
to connect all five cords to the bath water.
Close the circuits, and the door will open.
But you must work quickly
for in three minutes, an electrical current will surge
through this room locking the doors forever.
Who will bridge the gap?
The choice is yours.
Jesus Christ!
Its not gonna reach.
How the fuck are we gonna do this?
Come on!
No, don't do it! Please, no.
You killed her.
You fucking killed her.
I didnt trust her.
Jesus Christ what is it with you too?
Just shut up and help me with the body.
Wait, wait. No.
Dont let your body touch hers.
Oh my god, its a hook.
Stick it in her head or we dont get out!
Just do it!
Come in.
Sir, thats Jill Tuck.
Good evening.
Special agent Erickson.
Thank you for seeing me so late today.
Not a problem.
That will be all.
Please, have a seat.
So, what do you need from us?
I think I'm being followed.
Well, that sounds more like police work, Ms. Tuck.
I don't think they can help me.
Because...?
Because it's you. The FBI.
I dont understand.
It started when John was first identified as Jigsaw killer.
It didn't surprise me then, but I'm still being followed.
By who, Ms. Tuck?
Who would be following you?
I think it's the agent who interrogated me.
Agent Strahm.
And why would he be following you?
I don't know.
Who else have you told about this?
Only you.
What's going on with Amanda?
Didn't you tell me the only way to truly offer enlightment
is by detaching emotionally?
But you can have something Amanda doesn't.
?A longevity?.
Thats the greatest protection.
That's what I've given you.
I need you to set up a game.
It may not be entirely clear, to you right now.
But I assure you the people being tested
are a part of something much larger.
Theyre connected.
So in the end,
all the pieces will fit together.
And it'll be clear.
Amanda will fail you.
We'll see.
What are you doing?
What are you doing!
- Whats this?
- Who are you?
Its time to play a game.
Help! Help me!
What is it?
What is it Christ!
Why are you keeping me here!
What is this place! What is this place!
We were all supposed to die.
Jigsaw is fucking testing you!
Where is my daughter!
He didnt make it.
Nobody made it.
You were supposed to be the hero!
Peter, where the hell are you?
Hello?
You have reached the voicemail of a special agent Peter Strahm.
Leave a message.
Cowan, I want to put a locate on Strahms mobile phone.
Right away sir.
Call me right back.
All right.
...
...
There you are, Strahm.
All right. Back up.
What the hell is that?
It's our next nightmare.
There are blades in here.
It's connected to the door.
When the beaker fills up, the door opens.
Fills with what?
Blood.
Our blood.
I'm thinking... our wrists are supposed to go in there
and fill the beaker.
Wait. Why can't we just use the water from the other room?
No, it's locks are closed.
We have to stick our arm in to keep them open but then they get stuck.
We need to close that door.
So what?
We fight to the death and the...
the winner gets freedom
with the other person's blood?
Wait, wait, wait.
- Do you still have the keys from that first room?
- Yeah.
- Try one of them on that door.
- It wont work.
No, no. It might.
This one has a keyhole.
Its not even the same lock.
Why are there five slots in this machine?
Shouldn't there be only one?
They all would've worked.
- Where are you going?
- Hurry, before the bombs go off.
I don't think this is a good idea.
The tub wasn't meant for one person.
We were supposed to hold one cable each
and suffer a small shock.
It was meant for five people.
They all were, every game.
We only needed one key in the first room.
They all worked and any one of them would've opened every collar.
In the second room, the three chambers
were large enough for more than one person.
We were supposed to work together so we all survived.
Thats the game.
"Your lifelong instincts will tell you to do one thing
but I implore you to do the opposite."
Oh god. Whoops...
Yeah, big fucking whoops.
Hello and welcome.
This journey has been one of discovery
and hopefully you've discovered
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
The human body, for instance,
is an astoundingly durable creation.
It contains approximately ten pints of blood.
Yet it is still able to operate with just half of that.
The device before you is one of sacrifice.
A sacrifice of blood.
In order to open the door,
the beaker must be filled to the marked level.
A level that is of no coincidence.
This amount can come from anyone of you.
That does not matter.
What does matter is time.
For in 15 minutes, if the beaker is not filled,
the bombs will explode
and the doors will be sealed forever.
So now I ask you,
how much blood will you give in order to survive?
Fuck! Fuck!
All right.
So one person can fill the beaker
with ten pints and die.
Or two people can fill it with 5 pints...
...and maybe live.
What are we gonna do?
I lied.
I know the investigative journalist in there.
His name was Charles, he was writing a story about what I did.
What'd you do?
A dealer gave me...
an ounce of heroin
to burn down an abandoned building.
But it was...
Oh, god! It wasn't abandoned.
There was eight people in there...eight people...
...died.
And the Feds got involved
and I got caught but I made a deal
and my dad got me off.
But the guy who hired me disappeared
and nothing happened. Nothing happened.
The fire.
It's what connects us.
The fire inspector who worked
a bogus accident report.
The city planner who pushed through
the residential permits.
The journalist that beared the investigated story.
The rich kid junkie who was the patsy.
And the real-estate developer who set it all in motion.
We killed eight people
and stole the property and nobody cared.
Why did they all do it? Was it for money?
This was your plan?
There was eight people still living in that building!
You had to know that! Did you know that?!
I cant do this alone! Look at me!
I cant do this alone! I cant!
- I cant!
- Ok, ok.
We have to do it on three.
One!
Two!
I cant enter the hole!
Three!
Hello agent Strahm.
If you are hearing this, then you have once again
found what you are looking for.
Or so you think.
You dedication is to be commended.
But I ask you:
have you learned anything in your journey of discovery?
As the old addage goes, "Fool me once, shame on you".
"Fool me twice, shame on me."
The situation you find yourself in is one of trust.
So I ask you, Special Agent Strahm:
Have you learned to trust me?
The only way to survive this room
is by entering the glass box before you.
Pain will be incurred,
but you will have a chance of survival.
We did it.
We won. We won.
I got you, you motherfucker!
Drop it!
I said drop it!
Who did this to you?
Who did this to you?
We won. We won.
We worked together...
...in it...
I need immediate medical assistance.
Jesus, Peter.
Tell me how to open it.
How do I open it?
However, if you choose not to,
you will never be heard from again.
Your body will never be found.
You will simply vanish.
I ask you, Special Agent Strahm:
Have you learned enough to trust me?
- Will you heed my warning? For if you do not...
- Fuck you.
...this room will forever be your tomb.
And my legacy will become yours.
If you're good at anticipating the human mind...
I think Im being followed.
Who would be following you?
I want to talk to Jill Tuck one last time.
He suspected someone on the inside.
It leaves nothing to chance.
We were all supposed to die.
You were supposed to be the hero.
Make your choice.
Cowan, it is Ericksson.
I want you to put out an A.P.B.
Suspects name is Peter Strahm.
Yeah, that's right.
Special Agent Peter Strahm.
Tell me how to stop it you son of a bitch!
I know who you are!
I know!
