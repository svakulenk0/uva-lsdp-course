- How was it?
-
Seriously, man,
the sickest shit since
It was creepy. Really creepy.
Are you gonna make it over here? Can you
come over? You wanna come over?
Dude, look, I'll come up this weekend,
we'll burn it solid.
- I'll see you this weekend.
- Late.
- Shit, man. Don't you knock?
- All right. Whoops.
- Shut the door, perv.
- I found you in the game. You got it good.
We haven't played for hours.
OK.
This is not real. Don't freak.
- Hello?
-
- Hello?
-
Rex?
Sar...
Sarah?
Rex! No!
Please!
Oh!
- That was fast.
- Hi. How are you?
- Did you take care of the marina report?
- I was just about to.
Oh, don't bother.
He wants to see you right away,
and he's in one of his moods.
- Happy birthday, by the way.
- Oh,  Darling.
Hi.
- I was just gonna...
- Over a month.
That's how long
I've been working on this.
Right? That's, uh...
That's 100... that's 100 hours.
I'm sorry. I'll finish
the marina report as soon as possible.
The ma... The what?
- Marina report?
- Yeah.
Oh, man.
Hm.
- Hutch.
- What?
You know what?
Have a seat. Enjoy yourself. OK?
All right, listen to me now, OK? I hired you
for one reason, and one reason only.
Now, the walk-through says
I dump the ammo and the boss dies.
I'm sorry. We're not still talking
about  are we?
Yes.
OK. Damn. All right. Uh... I don't know what
else to tell you. You got the hyperblaster?
Do I look like an asshole?
Yes, I have the hyperblaster.
Right, OK. Yeah, dump it.
I mean, it's got unlimited ammo,
nullifies the... Hey, can I get tomorrow off?
Let me think about that.
No, no, no.
I need it to get to the final boss.
Beat her up.
It's the way God intended.
You know, Hutch, if you put as much effort
into clerking as you did into gaming,
you could end up like me someday.
You know that, right?
OK.
All right, you can take tomorrow.
How do I do it?
It's easier to kill her
without the blaster.
So lose it right before going down the
stairs. She'll die on her own. Game over.
All right. OK. Hey, man,
are you hip to this PDA sex thing?
- I haven't got into that.
- You've got a phone call, Hutch.
Thank you.
I think that's a vegetable.
Hello?
What?
Oh, Hutch. I'm so glad that you came.
It means so much to me.
Today we lay to rest
Loomis Crowley...
- Did you just take a picture of me?
- I did.
There are so many crying faces
at this funeral and you seem the saddest,
but you weren't crying,
so I took a picture.
- You and Loomis must have been close.
- Yeah, we were close.
I mean, we  so close, but...
Did you know Loomis?
Kinda.
I grew up with Sarah back in Georgia. I was
supposed to hang out with her that night.
Really? Yeah, so was I.
I always thought I'd be taking pictures
on her wedding day, not her funeral.
- Looks like you're up.
- Emma. Hi.
- Hi.
- How are you? God, look at you.
You're so grown-up.
How are you doing?
I'm OK. Um, here.
This is your brother's bag.
You don't want this?
Mom and Dad won't let me play those
video games. They were gonna toss 'em.
You know, they're too violent.
Besides, he would want you to have 'em.
Come here. Take care, all right?
OK.
Here. If you need to talk,
that's my number.
- Hey, sunshine.
- Hey.
Didn't think you'd be back so soon.
Give us a kiss.
- Sorry, Hutch. Are you OK?
- Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to believe.
Tragedy, Hutch.
I tell you, bro, first your parents, now this.
God dealt the straws
and gave you a short one, man.
You know, Phin,
the problem with your mouth
is that stupid insensitive shit
comes out of it. You're an idiot.
Be strong - that's all I'm saying. You know
what I mean, bro? You're a rock. I love you.
- I love you too.
- Who talks to their brother like that?
- Somebody with an idiot for a brother.
- Oh, my God, you're a terrible person.
So, do they know what happened yet?
He was murdered -
him and two of his friends.
- That's awful.
- What's in the bag?
- Games, pictures, crap like that.
- From Loomis?
Yeah.
- No shit! Is this you two?
- Yeah.
Look at that.
Lighter works.
- Gorgeous.
- Dude, you can keep that if you like it.
- I'm sorry, Hutch.
- You must have been adopted.
Thank you, Loomis.
- So he was a real gamer, huh?
- Yeah.
- Any good titles in the bag?
- I'm not sure. Check it out.
Goddamn, y'all.
Never heard of it.
Yeah, that was the game
he was playing out the night he died.
He asked me to come over and play.
I totally blew him off.
- Hutch, come on. You didn't know.
- I know. It's just...
- How'd he get his hands on it?
- He did some beta-testing.
I beta-tested for a while. It's awesome
at first, then it's goddamn monotonous.
- Let's burn a round for Loomis.
- Are you an idiot?
I told you, that'd be weird.
That was the last thing he was doing.
Hey, sack up, bro.
If Loomis was indeed testing this game,
that means it is barely legal.
Yeah, this could be nice.
- Hey.
- Jesus Christ!
Can Hutch come out and play?
Swink,
you scared the crap out of me, man.
Why, yes, I'd love to come in.
Thank you for asking.
I wanna make sure we're all set up.
So, uh...
I'm sorry, you know,
about your friend and all.
It...
stinks.
Thanks, man.
Look, it's all good. No worries.
It'll be good to hang out with you guys,
get my mind off things.
Hey. Ooh.
Dollface, is there something
you'd like to tell me?
Hey, you made it.
October, fellas, this is Abigail.
She's kind of a friend of Loomis's.
She's gonna hang out for a while.
- What's up, mama?
- What's up? I gotta pee.
- Oh, yeah. It's right down the hallway.
- Oh, sorry.
- All right?
- Yeah, I'm good.
Girl has got body karate going on.
Anyone who says size doesn't matter
never played a third-person shooter.
You're a whore.
- Here.
- No.
- What did you say?
-  Hey.
God, that thing is gay.
And it smells.
- Don't worry, I'll get your back.
- Sweet Sebastian Bach, I wanna play.
- Bossman hooking up?
- Miller, you signed in? You there?
Yeah, I'm here.
Yeah, Loretta called my wife, told her
I got caught up in a partner meeting.
All right, guys. Enough chatter.
The name of this game is
We don't know much else,
other than we're not supposed to have it.
Sit back down.
Bro!
Let's do it.
- Dude.
- Put your hands on it.
- Disgusting.
- Touch it.
She's stubborn.
Isn't letting me get to the game.
Maybe you're supposed to read
that prayer right there.
- Just a thought.
- Voice-activated? No way.
- That's next-generation technology.
- OK.
"Come to me, clouds."
Whoa.
- What?
- It's... it's like a séance or...
Can we skip this bullshit cinematic
foreplay? I wanna butter this muffin.
- OK. Let's go. Everybody say this, right?
- OK.
"Come to me, clouds.
"May you rise as an evil storm
born to rip them open.
"Let the cover of night bear witness
and destroy those who resist
"so they shall harm me not.
"Let the blood of many cleanse me,
"preserving beauty eternal, I pray you."
- Gerouge.
- You've heard of it?
Yeah. Grandma used to tell us if we didn't
get home before dark, we'd get taken off...
Yeah, but do you remember Grandma
used to wear panties on the outside?
Seriously, though, I know this, guys.
I've heard this story.
- My God.
- I'm starting to get a little creeped out.
- Sh!
- Shut the hell up.
-  Where the hell are you going?
- Just trying to figure it out.
-  What is that?
- Whoa.
- You guys feel that?
- Hell, yeah. Feel it in my pants, baby.
- Must mean we're close to something.
-  Or something's close to us.
Uh, you better pull your weapon, bro.
- Somebody do something. Swink?
- No, I'm good.
How do you kill her?
She's already dead. Look out!
Right. It'll give us a chance
to escape ghosts we can't face.
Undead can't cross
the twig of a wild rose.
That is what you learn when you read
too much goth chick-lit. Lay off the incense.
And the game's fun,
but it kind of moves along at a snail's pace.
Left, go left.
Left! On your left!
Left! Left!
Goddamn it, you noob!
Come on! Sweet Jesus, these dead bitches
are coming out in droves.
Hello, Mumsy.
- Whoa, whoa. What's that?
- What's... where?
- There. Is something in that wardrobe?
- Oh, nice eye.
Thank you.
- Congrats, Abs.
-  It's a secret room or something.
-  Is that a diary?
-  Yeah.
The one from the beginning
with the prayer in it.
-
- Yeah. No, I'm good.
Are you in those tunnels again? There is
no action there. The doors are locked.
Well, they're open now.
You know, I'm exploring, tearing shit up.
- Ownin' fools.
- "Ownin' fools"?
- I'm telling you, my controller is vibrating.
- You'd better drop a rose.
Now I'm out of... I'm out of...
I'm out of goddamn roses, man.
- Tell us what you see before you book it.
- Some sort of sick torture room or...
God, man.
I just saw a flash of dead girls, or...
Goddammit, man.
- She got me.
-
Some woman, man. I think it was the dame
from the painting. You know, that countess.
I didn't even
get a chance to fight her, man.
- Where's the torture chamber?
- I went through a secret entrance.
Hey, are you gonna try
and get back in the game?
Well...
Hey, is somebody out there?
-
- I don't know.
Probably some goddamn rent-a-cop
trying to scare the shit out of the living.
You know what they say. You play
the game too long, you start seeing shit.
- You know, or have seizures.
-
Perceptive reality, on the other hand,
has yielded some interesting studies.
-  And you've read them all.
- I have. It seems the longer you play,
the more your mind
perceives the game world to be a reality.
It's interesting, but it's only a theory.
But then there's retinal memory, which...
That is so fascinating, sweetie,
but I'm feeling like we should call it a night.
Yeah, some of us
have gotta be at work.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll check my schedule.
Thanks again for hanging, you guys.
I really needed it.
- To Loomis.
-  To Loomis.
To Loomis.
All right. OK. OK.
Perceptive reality.
- Hutch!
- Loretta.
- What's going on? What's going on?
-
- What's going on?
- It's Miller.
Miller?
Miller. Miller!
Hey, it's a crime scene.
You have to clear out.
Can I get a damn curtain over here?
- I just spoke to him a few hours ago.
- Whoa. A few hours ago?
- Get off me.
- All right, buddy. Come on. Come on.
Thanks.
I know this kind of thing ain't easy, son.
I'm gonna try to be quick about it.
You were here
with Mr. Banks last night?
Uh, no. I was at my house.
We were playing a video game.
Oh.
His wife said that he was working late.
Yeah, sorry. What I meant was, he was
playing from here and I was at my place.
- Just the two of you?
- I was with four friends. We were online.
Uh-huh.
- Make sure we get those names.
- Roger that.
- Do you live close by?
- Yeah, uptown. Off Magazine.
Oh, yeah?
That's only ten minutes away.
Those figures could place you
at the scene of the crime.
Charlie, chill.
- I just wanna know what happened to him.
- All right, now.
OK, if you ever need to give me a call,
my name is Detective Thibodeaux.
I may need to speak with you again.
And I'm sorry about your friend.
Thanks.
All right.
Sweet shit! Get a load of this!
I think I've found bossman's body.
- Oh, God!
- That's off-putting.
- Didn't you just say Miller was stabbed?
- Man, I can't look at this.
I'll have to quit
hanging around with you.
I'm sorry. Phin, if you had any less sense,
you'd be half a penny.
Now shut the goddamn game up.
- Because we found Miller's body in it?
- It is a horror survival game.
I hate to be a dick, but I think
you guys are overreacting a little bit.
- Would you show some respect, man?
- Respect?
You pay respect to gamers by gaming,
so let's boot it up. To Miller.
- You're not playing for Miller or Loomis.
- You didn't even know those guys, right?
If you wanna curl up in the fetal position
for the day, fine, but don't expect me to.
As for you,
I just met you yesterday, so kiss my ass.
- Phin!
- What?
Look, why don't you guys get out of here
and let me play in peace?
Peace.
Hey, take it easy.
I'm sorry.
Are you OK?
- I'm just having a hard time, you know?
- Yeah.
Abigail, what's your story?
We don't know much about you,
other than you can't game for shit.
Well, I grew up in Georgia.
My dad's an architect and my mom's
a kindergarten schoolteacher.
I'm going to Princeton in the fall.
Sounds like you've got
a perfect little family.
I don't know about perfect.
- Uh...
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
I've got a thing with fire.
It's a long story. No big deal.
What's up?
Finding Miller's body in the game...
Look, I'm no gamer, but there are only so
many ways you could die in a video game.
It's all just really bad timing.
Not really. In a sense, the timing is bad
because he overresponds to deaths.
But the coincidence of finding Miller's
game body and his real body was perfect.
That's why we're freaked out.
It's better in single player anyway.
Dickheads.
All right, Countess, let's go.
There you are.
Oh, you hate mirrors. I forgot.
- You can't break this one.
-
Maybe timing had nothing to do with it.
Maybe it was inevitable.
Possible homicidal replication
on a sociopathic level.
Where are you going?
Loomis and his friends were playing that
video game the night they died. Now Miller.
What are the chances of all of them being
murdered right after playing that game?
Jesus, if Phineus is playing...
- Come on, honey. You've gotta relax.
- It's just bad timing.
Swink said
maybe timing has nothing to do with it.
Did I say that? I have a penchant
for big theories. Don't listen to me.
Phineus!
Phin! Oh, my God!
- What are you doing, man?
- I'm pulling this bitch. What's it look like?
- What if Loomis and Miller...
- Was more than a coincidence?
They both played the game
and then they died, so...
obviously the video game
killed them, right?
- Are you serious, man? Listen to yourself.
- Phin.
I was ready to bite it anyway.
Check this mirror I found.
I flipped it. The back works like a mirror,
but it won't break like the others.
I think it's made out of polished silver.
I don't know. You guys don't have one.
You've been through a lot and I love you,
but you're freaking everybody out now.
I know. Yeah.
Nice.
"No distinguishing marks."
Had a broken banister.
"Adjoined twin blades."
This is why I'm missing
my G4techTV weekend wrap-up?
Hot sugar.
We had this conversation.
Call me crazy, call me paranoid,
I don't give a shit. Just look at this.
- Why isn't Phineus showing?
- He said he'd be here, so he'll be here.
OK. So we all saw
that Miller was stabbed to death.
The cops think he was stabbed
with shears. Loomis's friends too.
Sarah - her body was drained of blood.
The police report said Loomis's neck
was broken, and he was hung in the game.
They all died
the same way they died in the game.
This can't just be some coincidence.
I don't like this at all.
I think you're right.
You know I told you I heard
the story of Gerouge from my grandma?
This Elizabeth Bathory chick
was sick and twisted - and very real.
Guys, every detail of this game
is based on her real life.
The tower,
the cemetery, the torture chamber.
She'd hunt for victims in a black carriage.
She'd gut them with silver shears. The
shattered mirrors, why were they broken?
She couldn't stand to see herself get old.
All facts.
All I care about is finding out
what happened to Miller and Loomis,
and you are not helping.
As punishment, they walled the bitch up
in her tower alive - and here's the kicker.
The last thing she said
was that one day she'd be back.
So what if she's back and killing us
one by one after we die in the game?
This is insane. Listen to yourself.
You don't want to listen to me, fine. All
I care about is: Where the hell is Phineus?
# Close your eyes,
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
# Close your eyes, I want to see you tonight
in my sweet dreams
Funky.
Is anybody out there?
Phin, are you OK?
-
- Phin, it's Hutch. Where are you?
I was on my way,
but my whip got stuck out on River Road.
- I'm just south of Binky's Adult Store.
- I'll drive.
- Who's that? Abigail?
-
- What's up, mama?
-
Swink, when you were talking
about perceptive reality,
were you talking about
hearing or seeing things, or both?
Shut up. I've not tripped out like this
since I ate that matzo ball at Bible camp.
Let's go.
That's right!
I didn't die in the game, baby.
Hey.
Wait a minute.
In the game, she only comes at night.
Is anybody out there?
OK, we're close.
Look for his car.
Stop, stop, stop. Stop! Wait.
Phin!
Phin.
Jesus. Phineus died
exactly the same way he died in the game.
Need to tell me something?
This is...
This is gonna sound crazy,
but this game,
is about the Gerouge Plantation
and a woman, Elizabeth Bathory.
- I think I know that ghost story, yeah.
- OK. Phineus was run over in the game.
Miller died the same way
he died in the game too.
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute, kid.
- I got this game last week from a friend.
Him and two of his friends were murdered
the same way they died in the game.
Now, explain that.
Right.
That's the Crowley case,
over in Church Point.
You lived with that family, right?
After what happened with your folks?
Yeah.
You talked to that Crowley kid
the night he was murdered?
You know I did, Detective.
- Technically, anybody can hack into...
-  Shut up.
Let's take a walk.
- Let's see why you're so scared.
- I don't think...
Shut up.
- How do you do this thing?
- You have to read that.
All right.
"Come to me, clouds.
May you rise as..."
There must be a connection.
- Oh, yeah, there is, Hutch.
- Look, I already told you...
I'm telling you.
Friend or no friend, game or no game,
next time I see you on a crime scene,
I'm gonna take you in.
I wonder how you would feel
if that was your friend.
- Someone you cared about, Detective.
- I would let the cops do their job.
Hey!
Hey, don't play that game.
Hey! Come on! Come on.
I just think
it would be better if no one plays.
I can see, at your tender age,
something like this might scare you.
- Come on. Come on.
- I got it.
All right.
I'm gonna look into this,
but you're gonna have to go home, Hutch.
Why don't you lock that kid up?
He rode up on a carriage
and mowed down the girl's brother?
This game business
sounds like bullshit.
That's great.
That's just really stupendous.
I know it! We all know it!
Something's happening, something bad!
Swink, shut the hell up!
You're not helping, man.
Why did you have to bring that game
into our lives, Hutch?
Why?
October.
My brother was all that I had.
That kid meant everything to me,
and now he's gone.
October...
I didn't know.
I didn't know. I'm so sorry.
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.
Neither do I.
So we have to do something.
Hutch, I want you to find out
everything you can about this game.
OK. I can start with Loomis's house.
I need to stay with Swink
and take care of things for Phin.
Are you OK?
Are you sure you're up to this?
Hutch, somebody ran my brother down
in a horse-drawn carriage.
I'm gonna find whoever did it
and hurt them.
OK.
Abigail, stay with Hutch.
But if anything happens to him...
And we don't play that game,
not for a second.
Hey, a little help here?
Let me guess.
Your wife and kids are driving you nuts.
Need something to take the edge off?
Something with a high frag-count.
- Do I look 12, man?
- I take it you don't play, then.
I retired after I won
the Greater Louisiana  tournament.
- Oh,  huh? Great.
- Yeah, listen.
I need information
on a horror game called
Never heard of it.
Maybe it's underground.
- Do you know who made it?
- Some basehead in his mom's attic.
You know, a game is just an extension
of the mind that created it.
You wouldn't play a game
by Charlie Manson.
No. Probably not.
Maybe you already have.
Yeah. Yeah, I got nothing.
It's probably some sort of
underground game or something.
Yeah, right.
Hey, so, listen,
I'll talk to you in a little bit,
all right?
She must have left
at least one of these windows open.
- How do you know that?
- I lived with the Crowleys for a while.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it was like, you know,
Loomis's house just felt like home.
Yeah, I used to kinda run here
when things got, you know...
- You don't have to talk about it.
- No.
My dad went a little nuts,
thought my mom was sleeping around,
which she wasn't.
He figured
if she wasn't gonna be with him,
she wouldn't be with anybody,
so he set the place on fire.
Just torched it.
The firemen barely got me out alive,
but my mom...
She was still in bed
when they found her.
I tell myself if I'd been a little older
or a little braver,
I would've...
I would've stopped him.
I didn't move.
When he gets out, he'll be 76.
Ain't nothing like family.
This window's open.
So that's why you're scared of fire?
That's why I hate fire.
- I'll go around to the front door, OK?
- OK.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Let's check out Loomis's room.
What could we find in here
that the cops haven't already found?
They didn't know where to look.
- Huh.
- What?
What is it?
It's the game company
Loomis tested for, where he got the game.
Scary.
I found the address for the game company.
Tell me where 1420 Cypress Road is.
Not a problem.
Let's see. Take the Belle Chasse Highway
to Breaux Bridge, near Spanish Lake.
Look, we're heading
to the game developer.
I've been reading this book
called
-
- It means "the witches' hammer."
It was a handbook for witch hunters
in the Inquisition. It says if we find her,
we need to put three nails through
her heart, neck, and then forehead.
The nails are gonna put
her human spirit back into her body,
and then - this is really,
really important, you guys -
"An undead soul is only cleansed
by burning its blood."
So you think her ghost
could've been brought back?
It's like a séance. A strong enough spirit
can be brought back with the proper text.
I just can't believe this.
October?
Oh, my God!
The cop, King, he's dead.
What?
- We've got another problem.
-
Oh, God. The police are here.
OK, OK. Meet us at Loomis's.
-  Loomis's?
- He's right.
- If you don't wanna go to jail, go now.
- Jail?
Now! Come on!
Give it to me.
Toss the apartment.
What have we got?
- You remember her diary?
-  Her diary?
Yeah, in the game.
- What if that's it?
- What?
- The proper text.
- That would mean that...
This is not about some ghost.
You expect me to believe we conjured up
her evil spirit with a game séance?
- To start, we all had to recite that prayer.
- That just... It's highly unlikely.
What is it, Swink?
October and I were talking about this.
I don't know. Maybe she's onto something.
- Why is the game on?
- What?
The game.
I didn't turn it on.
I told you not to play.
- Where's October?
-  She's out smoking.
But you said if we didn't play the game
we'd be fine. I thought those were the rules.
I don't know what the rules are.
Maybe there aren't any.
October!
It's not possible.
I didn't play. None of us did.
- If nobody played the game, that means...
- The game's playing by itself.
OK.
October!
October!
Shit!
No!
Let me go!
- October!
-  October!
October!
Help me!
October!
Let me go!
- Open the window! Come on!
-
Come on!
Go fuck yourself.
Come on.
It's open. It's open.
October!
Oh, no! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no!
You're gonna be OK. You're gonna be OK.
I can fix this. I can fix this. No, no, no, no.
Goddammit!
Please, don't do this to me!
- I shouldn't have left her alone.
- This isn't your fault, Swink.
This is all my fault.
You should've left
when you had the chance.
Your life was perfect before this.
My dad's not an architect.
- What?
- My dad's not an architect.
My mom doesn't teach first grade.
- You mean kindergarten?
- Whatever. I'm not heading to Princeton.
Pretty much
everything I said was bullshit.
- So this van is...
- Home sweet home.
I hate telling people the truth and
watching them get embarrassed for asking.
We gotta end this.
We gotta stop it.
- I don't think we have much time.
- You're right. We don't have a lot of time.
We need to find her body.
Which means
we need to find her tower.
Whoever made this game
knows everything about Elizabeth Bathory.
They're the ones who are gonna know
exactly where her plantation really is.
Hey! Swink, what are you doing?
It's obvious we have to stay alive
in the game until we end this.
- One of us has to play.
- If you die in the game...
Something won't let us stop playing.
Am I right?
If it's gonna play with or without us,
at least I can use myself as a decoy.
I can protect us.
Let's go.
- All right, buddy, you know what to do.
- Stay alive.
Game time.
This thing  gay.
This is where
they made
It seems like
a strange place to make a game.
Come on. Let's go.
Hello?
Hold on.
I'm gonna check it out, OK?
Wait here.
Oh, my God.
Holy shit.
Thank God, man.
Tell me you haven't died in the game.
- No, we're fine.
- The place is deserted.
- OK, I need you to get to the back door.
- I'm not really sure where that is.
- What room are you in?
-
All right. Hold on.
-
- Yeah.
What's going on, Swink?
How do you know all this?
Just pay attention. All right, go through
the kitchen and out the back door.
Just keep walking
until you see the steps with the statues.
-
-
Just like the game.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
This is Gerouge Plantation.
We're in the bitch's backyard.
Elizabeth.
- What does this mean, Hutch?
-
No shit.
Elizabeth's diary.
All these girls. She killed them all.
-
-
Abigail's in trouble upstairs.
Which way do I go?
Uh...
It's faster to take
the staircase around the side.
OK.
It's locked! It's locked.
I need a crowbar or something.
You gotta be kidding me.
- Which way?
- Right, to the bedroom.
Aw, come on, Swink.
-
- Wait. Wait. I have a key.
- This is...
- Insane. Now go!
Hutch!
- I don't think I'm gonna make it. Help me.
- I know. I see her.
It's all right. It's all right.
It's OK.
It's all right. It's OK.
What happened?
Are you guys all right?
Yeah. You saved her life, man.
- Goddamn sweet!
-
We need three nails. And one last thing.
Remember what October said.
The way to cleanse a witch's soul
is to burn her blood.
Wait. The roses. If you're gonna go
up there, you can't forget the wild roses.
- You never know, and I bet...
-
No! No!
Hell, yeah!
Swink!
Come on, you bitch.
Oh, shit.
Bitch, that's cheating!
I'm not dead yet.
Go!
- Swink!
- Swink!
- Swink!
-  Help me!
Get away!
Get away from me!
Swink!
Hutch, I'm sorry.
OK, we're gonna need a hammer.
- Come on.
- Quick!
Open the door!
Hutch, come on.
Come on! Hutch!
Thanks, Swink.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's OK. It's all right.
OK?
- I'm gonna go first. Stay right behind me.
- OK.
It's OK.
-
- Wait. Did you hear that?
OK. All right. All right, all right.
Come on.
This way. This way.
There should be a second door in here.
This should be the tower.
Yeah, come on. Let's go.
Hutch!
-  It won't open.
- Oh, no! Open it!
OK. OK, wait, wait, wait. Let me think.
Let me think. I can get this open.
- How?
- I don't know. Just give me a second.
- Hutch. Hutch!
- It's just a... What?
We don't have the time!
Just think about it.
You gotta finish this.
No.
- Listen.
- I'm not leaving you.
Hutch.
I want you to go.
You're our only chance.
OK?
- This can't be happening.
- Well, it is.
I won't let her take you.
I know.
You be careful of that.
OK.
He loves me,
he loves me not.
He loves me,
he loves me not.
He loves me,
he loves me not.
He loves me...
Go away!
Go away!
-
-
No! Go away!
Hutch!
Mom!
- Hutch!
- Come on! Move!
Come on, hurry.
Move! Come on, man!
- Move!
- Hutch!
Come on.
Come on, man! Come on!
Come on! Come on, Hutch!
Killer.
