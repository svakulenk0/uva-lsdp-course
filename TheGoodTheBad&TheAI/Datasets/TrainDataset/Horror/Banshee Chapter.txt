We are not professing
to tell you
the complete story
of these activities.
We are professing to tell you the
complete story that we know.
But these records that we've
uncovered don't tell the story.
They tell pieces of it.
They were looking
for fundamental information
on compounds that were...
would be capable
of causing...
changes in behavior,
changes in mental attitude.
MALE REPORTER:
Did you ever consider
what would have happened
if any of these substances
were given to, say,
unwitting people?
Testing it out
on an American citizen?
I...
I guess I must seem very,
very cold-blooded about this,
but I don't recall
ever having been
very much preoccupied
with that, uh--
with that issue.
Thousands of
government-sponsored experiments
did take place at hospitals,
universities,
and military bases
around our nation.
Some were unethical,
not only by today's standards,
but by the standards
of the time
in which they were conducted.
Between the injection and the effects,
the patient was
transported to whatever
or wherever it is
that DMT leads people.
When the Freedom of Information Act
released a bunch of documents,
you found out that all
these different subjects
that had taken
this chemical
all experienced the same
phenomena under the drug.
They experienced
something out there
that came to them,
that met them halfway.
MALE REPORTER: But what
you can't lose sight of
is what all of this
would mean
in terms
of individual human beings.
There would be deaths,
there would be long-lasting
and harmful effects.
JAMES HIRSCH: Everyone who
took this chemical saw
and witnessed
the same thing,
and they all named it
the same thing,
even though they
were separate subjects.
RENNY SEEGAN: What'd they, uh...
What'd they name it?
Well, that's actually
the name of the chapter.
These entities were kind
of malignant and threatening.
And, actually, a handful
of the volunteers
had traumatic and terrible
encounters with these entities.
Nobody should have
to go through this.
The United States of America
offers a sincere apology
to those
of our citizens
who were subjected
to these experiments,
to their families,
and to their communities.
It's something that
I think the general public
has no idea that
our government was doing
and could really open up
some--some eyes.
RENNY:
And would you ever, uh...
Would you
ever try the chemical?
Uh, that's a big question,
isn't it?
That's the million dollar
question.
ANNE ROLAND: James Hirsch
was a close friend of mine.
We graduated together
from Atticus University.
We both took
writing courses together,
and we'd often work
on stories late into the night.
We wasted countless hours
at the bar
arguing about
political philosophy and movies.
But four years later,
my friend James went missing.
All right, it's on.
Now what do you want me
to do with it?
Just, um...
I don't trust myself to take accurate
notes while I'm on the chemical,
so I'm gonna ingest it, and
you're going to record.
RENNY: Okay.
Okay.
Hello. My name is James,
and this little guy
is 150 milligrams
of specially enhanced
Dimethyltryptamine, DMT 19.
It's supposedly impossible
to find, but here I have it.
RENNY: Well, where'd you get it?
Some friends in Colorado.
Oh, uh, FYI, Renny,
if this little chemistry
experiment goes sideways,
I want you to finish my
book and dedicate it to me.
Okay.
Be a terrible book.
Might be
a terrible book anyway.
We're not actually doing
anything illegal here.
RENNY: Whoa, you look so weird, dude.
Shut up.
No, just kidding.
You look the same.
Do you feel anything?
No?
No, I don't feel
anything yet.
Hey, I don't
want to see myself
doing some weird drug
on YouTube.
RENNY: Well, if you do
anything remotely funny,
I might actually save it.
Don't fuck
with me, Renny.
RENNY:
So if nothing happens,
are you gonna just make
something up for your book?
Wait. Do you--
What is that?
Do you hear that?
RENNY: That radio?
Where's it coming from?
It's like interference.
RENNY: What is that?
JAMES: Wait.
What if it's coming from
something in the house?
RENNY: Do you think
someone's here?
RENNY: I don't like this.
We should call someone.
I ingested the chemical,
remember?
I took that. We don't...
Oh, fuck, Renny.
RENNY: What?
It's coming
towards the house.
What is?
I don't know.
JAMES: What is this?!
RENNY: What do you
want me to do?
This...
Help!
DEPUTY: Look, you think maybe he
was having some kind of spasm,
some kind of reaction
to the drug he took?
Look, no. It wasn't...
Can you recall
making any movements
to strike or push him
when he was convulsing?
Is that
how it happened?
No, I--
No. I just ran.
I don't know what happened...
And you didn't take the drug?
No, I didn't.
Are you sure?
I didn't take
the chemical!
ANNE: James and I didn't see
each other much after college.
True to both our words,
he struggled as a young,
but talented novelist.
I got into journalism
at an online news site.
Occasionally, we'd drop
each other an email
just to check in.
No one could tell me exactly
what had happened to James
because no one knew.
Nevada law enforcement
officials suspected
he'd been murdered
by his friend, Renny Seegan,
after James ingested
an enhanced form
of a rare contraband chemical
known as Dimethyltryptamine.
I been real nice
up to now,
but I'm gonna--
I'm gonna fuck your world, kid.
Have you seen
the kind of boys
we got down there
in the county lockup?
I'm gonna put you in there
with those son of a bitches.
I didn't do--
I didn't do anything.
Fresh piece
of fucking chicken!
All I know is
he said it was
from some friends
in Colorado.
God.
Oh, yeah.
I hear that every
time...friends.
What kind of friend
gives you poison?
ANNE: Without a body,
police weren't ready
to charge Renny Seegan
with any crime.
They would never
get the chance.
Renny vanished
almost 72 hours later.
He was never seen again.
I decided that James and I
would work
on one last project
together.
We would find out the truth
about what happened to him.
It would be
our final collaboration.
"James, I expect you'll find this batch
"will help immensely with your research.
"It wasn't easy to come by, "but
then again, nothing worth doing is,
"so I expect a full report "when
you come out on the other side.
Sincerely,
your friends in Colorado."
James,
what happened to you?
ANNE: Hello?
Hello?
Henry Cale?
Yes.
We spoke on the phone.
Hi. I'm Anne Roland.
So tell me everything you know
about shortwave radio broadcasts.
Yeah. Well, I'm an operator
and enthusiast,
and I've been working with it all my life.
Come here.
RENNY:
I don't like this.
We should call someone.
JAMES: I ingested
the chemical, remember?
I took that. We don't...
JAMES: Oh, fuck, Renny.
RENNY: What?
JAMES: It's coming
towards the house.
Yeah, that sound
on the radio
sounds exactly like one
of the known numbers stations.
Numbers stations?
Numbers stations are shortwave radio
stations of unidentified origin.
They generally broadcast
artificially generated voices
reading streams of numbers,
words, letters,
backwards music,
or cryptic electronic code.
They're in a wide variety
of languages,
and the voices are usually
female for some reason.
Sometimes it sounds
like a child.
And how long have you been
hearing them for?
Well, the shortwave
community's
been finding them
for decades now.
Listen.
ELECTRONIC FEMALE VOICE:
Who would broadcast that?
Lot of theories--
secret government agencies,
terrorists, drug runners.
But it's never
been shown for sure
who or what
is broadcasting them.
So you've been keeping track
of these numbers stations
and documenting them
for years?
That's right.
And you've heard that
particular broadcast before?
Yes, I have.
The signal sounded like a
broadcast from this small area
we call the Lonely
Traveler Station.
The Lonely Traveler?
Yeah. Shortwave radio guys
named it that.
I've heard recordings,
but I've never gone out there
to listen to it myself.
Well, James's cabin
is right about here,
same area upstate.
So what do I need to do if I
wanted to record this broadcast?
Well, it's not easy.
You'd need to be out on the far
edge of the Black Rock Desert
between 3:00 to 5:00
in the morning,
and maybe
cross your fingers.
That's it?
Doesn't sound so bad.
Yeah, that's it.
I can give you
one of our receivers.
One more question.
Did you--Did you used
to work for the NSA?
Excuse me?
You know, the NSA.
You worked for them
as a code breaker.
Why do you say that?
Well, according to the NSA
employment verification contact,
Henry Cale worked there
from 1963 to 1979.
I wouldn't care
to discuss that.
So, out here
in the middle of nowhere,
from the nearest town,
on the outskirts
of the Black Rock Desert...
Listening, watching
for the Lonely Traveler.
Happy times.
Don't know where
James was
more than a friend.
Sometimes I find myself asking,
were you in love with him?
I guess I never really
thought of it until he was gone.
The signal
is getting stronger.
That's weird.
Is anyone out here?
Fuck, they're watching.
OLIVIA KMIEC: You need to
be more careful, Anne.
You don't know
who's out there.
With that substance,
do you know who or what
James might have been
involved with?
Well, there was this strange
message sent from someone,
I think sent
from his supplier.
They didn't sign it
with a name,
but they signed it
"your friends in Colorado,"
which is exactly
the same thing
that Renny Seegan
said on the police tape.
Oh, "friends
in Colorado."
Yeah, "friends
in Colorado."
Like the novel.
You know it?
Should I?
Mm-hmm.
Before your time, but it was a very
popular book in the late '70s.
Wait. This is
a Thomas Blackburn novel.
Yes. That's the way he
used to sign his letters,
the title of his novel,
Friends in Colorado.
Thomas Blackburn.
I--I know his work.
ANNE: Thomas Blackburn...
an infamous, crazed novelist
risen from homeless,
bipolar,
counter-culture activist
to literary icon.
His books were written
in a haze of pills, booze,
and, to some,
schizophrenic genius.
He was a beast
from a less civilized era.
WOMAN: Thomas!
Hey, Thomas!
THOMAS: You're ruining
my concentration!
ANNE: He'd been arrested
many times.
During an interview in 1974,
he tied the reporter to a chair
and threw him into the pool.
He isn't coming up!
ANNE:
He'd been arrested again
at the late Senator Raider's
reelection party in 1996.
THOMAS: Hey, hey, hey!
I'm press.
Press right here.
Hey, listen,
ladies and gentlemen?
Uh, you're
campaign contributors.
I just want you to know
that the acid in your drink
is gonna kick in
in about 18 minutes.
Thomas Blackburn?
THOMAS:
Who's asking?
Hi. I'm a journalist
from risingjournal.com.
I just wanted to know
if I could ask you
a few questions
about James Hirsch.
Have you read
my latest book?
Which one?
The one called
"Go Fuck Yourself"?
So Blackburn isn't talking
to journalists anymore.
That's fantastic.
So let's see what
this little guy has to offer.
Patient 11?
Time is 5:13 P.M.,
administering 200 milligrams of pure
Dimethyltryptamine extracted from...
Nobody said anything
about restraints.
PATIENT: What is this?
Hello, Dr. Kessel?
Just relax, please.
Everything
will be fine.
Whose voice is that?
They can see me.
They--They can see me.
In the room now.
I can hear them.
I can hear them.
It's all gone away.
It's all gone away.
You hear them?
It's all gone away.
N1.
N2.
H2.
O7.
C11.
They're here.
They're here.
Aah!
Patient 11,
can you hear me?
Patient 11, I need you
to respond to me!
Extracting 325 milligrams of
Dimethyltryptamine from a primary source.
Do you know
what's on that tape?
That's not regular Dimethyltryptamine
that the CIA injected people with.
Then what was it?
They were extracting a chemical from
a special source, the human brain.
Medical corpses,
the pineal gland.
Come on.
The chemicals foundnaturally
in the brain?
Yes. They're extracting it from dead
bodies, injecting it into live ones.
Lovely.
Anything else
good on that tape?
I don't know.
The last 35 minutes
have been erased.
I sent it over
to the guys at video forensics
to see if they can pull
anything out of it.
We get it back
next week.
Oh.
In the meantime,
I still got to find a way
to get to Blackburn.
You just know
he's connected to it.
He's a writer.
He doesn't have the skills to
synthesize something like that.
It's a CIA chemical,
I know,
but maybe Blackburn
got his hands on it somehow.
I mean,
think about it.
Both men in western Nevada,
the letter signature.
Blackburn found
the chemical
and gave it to James
for his research.
It's possible.
It's probable,
and I know what to do
to get to Blackburn.
Great.
What are you gonna do?
THOMAS:
Honey, I'm home.
How.
One bourbon, please.
BARTENDER: Hey, Thomas.
What's up?
I got arrested
this morning.
Same as yesterday, huh?
Yeah, same as yesterday.
I was peeing
in my own front yard
in the same spot
I been peeing in
for the past 15 years,
and there
just happened to be
a sheriff's deputy's car
parked there.
Fuckin' Nazi cop.
Don't you think
it's a man's right
to pee
in the fucking desert?
Thomas?
Thomas Blackburn?
Yes?
I'm the writer
who emailed you.
Sarah? Sarah Weiss?
Right!
Right?
Right, yes.
The "print is dead,
down on her luck" story.
Wow.
It's nice to finally
put a face to the name.
Well, it's nice to finally--
Sarah.
Oh, no thanks.
I've got a drink.
That's not for you.
THOMAS: I feel sorry
for you kids, you know that?
With your fucking computers
and shit.
You know what?
You can tell a writer
who actually puts
a pen to paper,
who actually scribbles
on a fucking napkin.
You haven't written a new
novel in, like, eight years.
I'm an old fucking man.
I would love to read
something you've written.
No, you wouldn't.
No, you wouldn't.
You know
what I like to write?
You know
what I like to write?
Pornography.
Oh, is that right?
I'm quite good
at it, yes.
"50 Shades of Shit."
Your fans worship you.
They don't worship me.
They worship
an image of myself,
an image I've created,
carefully constructed.
I'm a myth.
Come on, being loved
by so many adoring fans
isn't a good enough
motivation for you?
Let me tell you
something
one of my ex-wives
once told me.
She said, "Everyone
will love you, Thomas,
except those of us
who know you best."
But tell me,
young writer,
what is it
you are writing about?
Um, actually,
you'd probably love it.
It's a novel about the
narco war in Mexico
and two young lovers who experiment
with different chemicals and...
It sounds fuckin' trite.
Well, it's
a work in progress.
Yeah, make 'em--
make 'em lesbians.
Really?
Burmese throat-singing lesbians.
I don't know much
about that subject.
Maybe
you could help me.
Well, speaking of ingesting
experimental chemicals,
what are you doing
this weekend?
Um, I didn't plan
that far ahead.
Well, tell you what.
Why don't you join myself
and some fellow travelers
at my place.
We're planning
an experiment.
It'll be an experience
you will not forget.
Oh, I didn't know
you were into...
What is it, art?
Yes, that's art,
young lady.
It's not a toy.
Don't touch that.
ANNE: So who did your interior
decorating, Charles Manson?
Oh, why,
fuck you very much.
You have
a lot of weapons around.
Didn't you shoot
your assistant last year?
Yes, and I feel terrible
about that.
But in my defense,
she was an idiot
for walking
into my line of fire.
Now people go around saying
I wanted to kill the bitch.
How do you not go
to jail for that?
You still have
your permit?
When you're innocent,
you can get away
with anything.
THOMAS: Sarah?
Party's in the kitchen.
THOMAS:
Sarah? Callie.
Callie? Sarah.
Callie is wicked smart.
She's got a PhD
in organic chemistry,
but she's
sort of an alchemist.
Yeah, she's a bit granola
and crystal for me.
She reeks of patchouli oil,
but I love her anyway.
So this is it?
How do you ever get
the formula for this?
It's my own
little secret recipe.
This is government
stuff, isn't it?
Aren't you worried about
the dangers of taking it?
This isn't the CIA,
Sarah.
We're not strapping
people down in a dark room
and scaring the fuck
out of them
just to see how far
we can stretch their sanity.
This is about...freedom,
mind expansion.
Power to the people.
Freedom, motherfuckers.
Positive energy.
That's right.
Positive energy,
huh?
Mm-hmm.
I can do that.
Yeah? You positive?
So don't start on me with that...
Yeah, I am positive.
fear shit, Sarah,
if you're really positive.
Well, it's
my first time.
It's normal, right?
What's normal?
THOMAS:
Here we go, Sarah.
Ready for takeoff?
A little for you,
a little for me.
A little for you,
a little for me.
A little more for you.
Ahh!
Foul fucking venom!
Wow.
How long
before it kicks in?
Oh, a few minutes.
Not as fast
as injecting it,
but not
as junkie, either.
Here we go...chaser.
Ms. Weiss, I wanted
to ask you something.
Sure. What is it?
How do you feel
about liars?
Uh, What? Liars?
Liars, swine, swindlers.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Well, I, for one,
cannot stand the bastards
who are bad at it.
That's it.
They lack
a certain panache.
Well, who does?
Now, I'm not opposed
to a good...
a good swindle
every now and then,
but a bad one,
a bad liar,
that's something that
I simply can't abide.
Yeah, I--I agree
with you.
What is it?
Your name's
not Sarah Weiss, is it?
Excuse me?
Now I can understand your
reticence with taking the drug.
I mean, why would a fine,
upstanding investigative journalist
like Anne Roland
want to sully
an already fragile reputation
with bad business like that?
No, it's not like that.
You have to...
It's okay, it's okay.
I've, uh...
I've told a few lies
in my time, too.
Yes. Recently, in fact.
For instance, I told you that the
drug was in that blue liquid,
which you so discreetly
threw in my wastepaper bin.
It's not?
No. No.
It was in the whiskey
you just drank.
You motherfucker!
No sympathy
for the devil.
Keep that in mind.
Buy the ticket,
take the ride!
And it's gonna be
a good one.
Olivia, call me back
as soon as you get this.
Blackburn tricked me
into drinking that chemical.
He knew exactly
who I was this whole time.
Call me.
This is Anne, by the way.
I...
I can't be alone
with Blackburn.
CALLIE:
I feel uncomfortable.
I--I feel unsettled.
Unsettled?
What, like physically?
Something is coming.
What do you mean,
something's coming?
Are you okay?
No, I'm not.
What's going on?
Wh-what--
Something's
watching you?
I don't like this.
It can see me.
Who can see you?
I don't know.
Did you hear that?
Callie?
Callie?
What's happened?
Are you okay?
It looked at me
from the window.
What did?
Talk to me!
I turned around,
and it was looking at me.
I saw it.
It's coming
to the house now.
What is?
It's downstairs now
by the back door.
What is?
You know.
Then he goes
out to the shops
That line up
outside his house
He'll always pause
at his reflection
But there ain't
nobody there
No, there
ain't nobody there
But he's got a friend,
she's behind the glass
How much you want
for the girl in the window?
I'll give you twice
whatever you think she's worth
I'll give you all that
and more to see her, too
Aah!
Aah!
THOMAS:
What is going on?
There's something
in your house, Thomas!
There's something
in your house!
Why, you're
just hallucinating!
Calm down!
No, no.
Callie saw it! I saw it!
There's something
in your house!
What? What? What?
Saw what?
It wants to wear us.
It wants to wear us.
It wants to wear us!
Don't say that.
Don't say that.
All right. You fuckers
stand over there.
Go on.
Sit in the corner.
Sanity,
for fuck's sake.
I hear something.
What the fuck?
Holy...
shit!
ANNE: What the fuck was that?
It was a hallucination.
ANNE: No, but--
We took a drug.
No. No, no, no.
THOMAS: Oh, fine!
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Stop it!
ANNE:
What's happening?
THOMAS: Shut up.
ANNE: Oh, fuck.
THOMAS: Do you have
any idea who I am?
I'll blow your fucking...
THOMAS:
Where's my gun?
Thomas? Wake up.
Thomas?
Wake up.
Wake the fuck up.
Where--Where's Callie?
Where did she go?
Don't know.
Where--Where the fuck
did she go?
What happened?
Was it the drug?
Did--Did
it really happen?
Where is she?
I don't know.
It seemed fucking real.
How long were we out?
I don't know.
A couple of hours?
I think the drug has
worn off at this point.
Oh, before I forget.
Jesus!
What the fuck?
How could you--
I'll fucking kill you!
You are just shit, Thomas!
Back off!
Let's get
the fuck out of here.
Fuck.
ANNE: Look, I need to know
what happened back there.
You and me both, sister.
That's what
these government boys do
is they take
something beautiful,
something transcendent
and powerful,
like pure Dimethyltryptamine,
and fuck it up!
Turn it into something dark,
something ugly.
What, you think
it's a mind control thing?
Well, if it's real,
what happened
to Callie's body?
Did you see her body?
No. No, I didn't.
Me, neither.
Makes you wonder.
Yeah. It makes me wonder
what else it did.
We're now going
to administer
of the new compound,
Number 19 enhanced
Dimethyltryptamine,
a combined substance containing
extract from the primary source.
Just relax.
There we are.
Just relax, dear.
All right,
don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.
Patient 14?
Patient 14,
can you hear me?
Patient 14,
can you hear me?
KESSEL: What's happening?
She's gone.
Where are
all the lights?
Let's check in there.
What is happening
to her?
WOMAN: No! No! No!
Aah! No!
No! No!
It came.
It came through.
What'd you say?
When you
go to sleep at night
You got someone
And when you wake
in the morning light
You're holding someone
But you
don't know his name...
Did you know
James Hirsch?
Uh...aspiring writer kid
who wrote me some letters
a couple years ago.
Wanted to know about the
chemicals used in MK-ULTRA.
So you sent him
the new chemical?
Callie made a batch.
Each batch is different.
But, yeah. Uh, he asked
nicely, using his real name,
so we acquired him some.
Well, James is missing,
probably dead.
Did you know that?
I did not.
I'm sorry to hear that.
You don't even know
what he looks like, do you?
No, I never met him.
So that's it then, huh?
That's what this
is all about.
I want to know
what happened to James--
why he went missing,
who's behind this,
and what this MK-ULTRA drug
is really doing to people.
You have any idea
what dirty business
the U.S. Government
has perpetrated
on its citizens
over the last 200 years?
And you want to know about one CIA
chemical brainwashing project.
Well, you didn't know
James, did you?
No.
Considering you ingested
the chemical, too,
I'm surprised
you're not more concerned.
I mean, who knows?
This shit could probably
kill you, too, Thomas.
Oh, people are afraid
of death
just because death
is so fucking ordinary.
It happens all the time.
No, not like this.
What about Callie?
How did she get her hands
on this--this chemical formula?
We didn't talk much.
She didn't talk much.
You don't ask
questions like that.
It's bad etiquette,
you know.
It makes them
squirrelly.
Would you know
where she lives?
Maybe we can go there
and check.
Yeah, sure.
She lives in, uh,
one of these McMansions
she bought outside of Reno.
It was in an empty suburb.
She got it
when the market tanked.
We used to go there
and smoke marijuana.
Aah!
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?
Thomas!
Are you okay?
Talk to me!
Oh, fuck.
Oh, my head!
God damn it!
ANNE: Shit.
THOMAS: Shit.
Someone
And you got someone
Someone
And you got someone
Someone
What happened to you?
I don't know.
I blacked out.
I heard chattering
and then blackness.
Ow, shit!
Thomas?
Ohh!
Are you okay?
The chemical
is like a catalyst.
It--It turns your mind
into a receiver.
It lets them in.
How do you know that?
I don't.
It's just a feeling.
Well, I want to find out
who's behind this.
Well, you're in luck, because I
think it wants to find us, too.
You stay there.
Take this with you.
Keep it on channel two.
Stay sharp.
Radio check.
Check.
The button's
on the side.
Check.
THOMAS:
Check.
THOMAS:  Have you
ever read any H.P. Lovecraft?
No.
Wrote a story in about
was about a scientist who
created an electronic device,
a giant tuning fork.
It emitted
a resonance wave that, um...
It stimulated anybody
who was nearby,
their pineal gland,
allowing them to experience
planes of existence outside the
scope of accepted reality.
He would see incredible,
sometimes horrible things,
these entities.
He kept turning it up
higher and higher,
'cause he was really getting
off on seeing this shit,
but it was too late
when he realized
that the entities,
they could see him, too.
You know, that's a really fucked-up
story to be telling me now.
Thomas, it...
It looks like someone's
been here.
Are you sure
she lived here,
like, ate and slept?
THOMAS:
She definitely was here.
How much sleeping she did,
I couldn't tell you.
There's
a surveillance camera.
Thomas, can you hear me?
I'm getting static.
What am I looking for?
THOMAS:
Should be a basement door
around the kitchen
someplace,
because anything
she's making
is going to be
below ground.
Keeps the feds
and local law enforcement
from using thermal imaging
to discover anything.
I got it.
Callie keeps parts
of the human brain down here.
THOMAS:
What does that mean?
It means she took at least part of
the chemical from the human brain.
THOMAS: Well, whatever
floats your boat, right?
Can we go?
It's cold out here.
She found Chamber 5.
It's in
the Black Rock Desert.
THOMAS: What?
Callie.
She found Chamber 5.
It's where they did the
original CIA experiments.
Dr. Kessel, MK-ULTRA?
THOMAS:
Can we go already?
It's 2:45 in the morning,
and my eyes are bleeding.
KESSEL:
The time is 5:13 P.M.,
administering 200 milligrams
of pure Dimethyltryptamine
extracted
from the primary source.
VOICE:
N1.
N2.
H2.
O7.
ANNE: "N1-N2-H2...
VOICE: C11.
O7-C11"?
Nitrogen, hydrogen...
oxygen, carbon.
Oh, my God.
Uh, the CIA didn't come up
with the formula.
They did.
Oh, my God.
You were right.
The chemical doesn't
make you hallucinate.
It turns your brain
into a receiver
so they could come through.
Shit.
Thomas, I'm looking at
the video surveillance footage.
It looks like Callie.
It looks like...
Callie walked
down to the basement.
Thomas, are you there?
I can see it
on the footage.
It's by the stairs.
Eight minutes ago.
Callie?
Callie?
Callie, is that you?
Callie?
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Help me!
Shit! Shit! Fuck!
Ohh!
Aah!
Well, Jesus, Anne!
You scared me!
ANNE: There's
only one option.
What is that,
dear Anne?
Into the desert,
Chamber 5.
THOMAS: No shit.
This is the heart of it.
Everything circles
around here.
I've seen things
in every single place
before either of us
took the chemical.
James's cabin, Callie's
house, the desert.
This is where we need to go if
we want to stop the signal.
This chemical is creating
more receivers,
more hosts to wear,
more ways to spread.
We've been
fucked with enough
by this horrible hydra
of a research project.
You don't scare
too easily, do you, Anne?
This shit terrifies
the fuck out of me.
Well, I'm more scared
of what it will do to me
if I try to run
and they all
catch up with us.
What if
it doesn't follow us?
Do you want to bet
your life on that?
Anne, I never
gave you the drug.
What?
I was fucking with you.
You lied to me
to get your story,
so I returned the favor
and I lied to you.
There wasn't anything
in that whiskey,
no--no DMT 19.
You're lying.
No, I'm not lying.
You can walk away clean,
Anne.
What will I do when it
catches up with me then?
Then what?
The point is,
you don't have to do this.
No, you're wrong.
James's friend, Renny,
didn't take the drug.
It was
only a matter of days.
Anne...
take your chances.
Isn't that
what I'm doing?
Ow!
What?
Shocked me.
Static electricity?
No, no, no, her brain,
it's still giving off
an electromagnet charge.
No, no. It's a corpse.
I know it's a corpse, Doctor.
It still shocked me.
You seeing this?
There's still activity
in the brain?
This is something stronger
than normal brain activity.
State of high alertness, beta
waves range max at 40 hertz.
This is going up to 135.
DOCTOR:
That's strong...
I think we can
walk from here.
You okay?
Thomas,
you're bleeding again.
I'm fine.
You know,
we don't have to do this.
I can take you
to a hospital.
Hey, you said yourself
it'll be waiting for us.
Let's not disappoint.
Every now and then,
you run up into a night
that's a stone-ass bummer
from start to finish.
On nights like those,
if you know
what's good for you,
you hunker down
and you hide.
This is not
one of those nights.
Tell you what.
We take this gas can,
and we torch
whatever we find inside.
Lead on, Anne.
ANNE: This must be where
they're broadcasting from.
THOMAS:
There she blows!
Hump
like a snow hill.
ANNE: This is
an old fallout shelter.
THOMAS: Well, you gotta give
those government boys credit
for efficient
repurposing.
After you.
ANNE:
Well, this is it.
It's Chamber 5.
They just left it
like this.
Thomas,
put the drugs down.
You know what
that's for, don't you?
No.
Medical doctors used
to tie people down to that
and fill them
full of exotic drugs.
Now, that's entertainment.
How do you know that?
What is that?
Fuck if I know.
I can't see anything.
Aah! Oh!
Oh, my God!
What is it?
Thomas, there's
something alive in here!
This is the transmitter.
This is the source.
We...
We need to burn
this thing.
Where did
we put the gas?
THOMAS: They wanted us
to come here!
Thomas,
where the fuck--
There's something...
There's something
coming down the hall!
Thomas, there's something
coming down the hall!
Close the fucking door!
ANNE: They're coming for us.
They're coming for us.
My God, they're
coming for us.
That's it. We're dead.
Ohh!
Oh, fuck.
Here, you fucks.
No, no, no, no!
Sorry, Anne.
Aah!
Thomas!
Damn you!
Please...come...back.
Please...come...back.
Please...come...back.
Aah!
VOICE:
Please...come...back.
Please...come...back.
Please...come...back.
Please...come...back.
Please...come...back.
VOICE:
Please...come...back.
Come...back.
Come...back.
Aah!
No!
Aah!
No!
No.
No. No.
James? No.
No.
Thank God!
I never thought I'd be
so happy to see you.
Just so damn glad
you're safe.
You scared the shit
out of me.
How you feeling?
Um, I'm surviving.
Do you think they'll
charge me with anything?
Rising Journal will
take care of any legal fees.
I think they'll
just want to keep you
a little while
for questions
while they try
to sort things out.
There's gonna be
years of questions.
Video forensics company
sent back your U-matic tape.
They were able to pull
additional footage from the end.
Well, what else
is on that tape?
Let's...
Let's not worry
about that now.
The things I saw,
I can't...
I found James's remains,
Olivia, in Chamber 5.
I--I--It was like he was
watching me this whole time.
It was wearing him.
Who?
It wasn't the drug
that killed him.
It is a chemical catalyst
that turns the brain
into some sort of receiver
and--and...
so they could come through.
Okay. I'm not saying this,
but you know
what they'll say.
They know the truth.
I--I really wish
I didn't.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
You're 100% certain that Blackburn
didn't put anything in your drink?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.
But how do you know
for sure?
He wouldn't.
He has no reason to.
Well, I hope you're right.
'Cause you just never know what's
really going on in someone's head.
Yeah, you're right.
You never found
Renny Seegan, did you?
No.
And he never took
the drug, right?
No. I...
You're gonna be okay.
No.
No, no, no.
OLIVIA:
What is that sound?
No, no, no. No, no.
Help!
No! No!
Somebody help!
Please help us!
No!
Aah!
Aah!
Again.
Aah!
THOMAS: It turns your mind
into a receiver.
It lets them in.
Approaching
His neurological response
is already so disrupted,
he's not going to be able
to recall any of this.
He's going to exhibit
some very unusual mental side
effects for the rest of his life.
Fine. Make certain.
And again.
Aah!
OLIVIA: You never know what's
really going on in someone's head.
DEPUTY: What kind of friend
gives you poison?
When you're done,
take him out of here.
KESSEL:
Just dump him?
He's injected with DMT 19.
We have no idea
what effect on the brain...
Clean-up and rehabilitation
are not our purview.
We are done with him.
You want me to just
hand him off to a field team?
Yes.
He lived near the campus,
grad student volunteer.
You can get his address
from our personal file.
What's the name?
Uh...Blackburn.
Thomas Blackburn.
Hit him again.
Aah!
He writes
as he turns his head
To catch the whispering
of wind
The hiss
of tape recorders
But there ain't
nobody there
No, there
ain't nobody there
Then he goes
out to the shops
That line up
outside his house
He'll always pause
at his reflection
But there ain't
nobody there
But the follow-up study
showed that 60% of those
who had been de-patterned
still have amnesia
for periods of anywhere
from 6 months to 10 years.
That's quite
a memory loss, isn't it?
That is a memory loss.
Indeed it is.
It's, uh, more...
I think
more than desirable.
How much you want
for the girl in the window?
I'll give you twice
whatever you think she's worth
I'll give you all that
and more to see her, too
He has an argument
with his lover
She'd slipped poisonous
snakes into his supper
Every night
since they first met
And she pretends
that she forgets
Now he cooks
his foil wrap
And goes back out
to the shops
To settle the debt
with his suppliers
As his lover
wakes up wet
Well-secured
and colored in
And now
she's safely pressed
Underneath the glass
Oh, yeah,
she's safely pressed
Underneath the glass
How much you want
for the girl in the window?
I'll give you twice
whatever you think she's worth
I'll give you all that
and more to see her, too
