DEBBIE-
It scares us just thinking about it.
When you hear it, you're gonna
think we're insane.
ED-
Try us. Please, from the start.
DEBBIE- It started out small,
Like a hand or a Leg was in a different position.
Then its head was Looking up
instead of down.
And then one day, it was in
a completely different room.
It was moving around by itself.
ED- Ever think maybe somebody had a key
to your apartment and was playing a trick?
DEBBIE-
That's exactly what we thought.
But never once did we find any
sign or evidence of intrusion.
LORRAINE- And this all led you to believe
that the doll was possessed?
Yes.
Camilla got in touch with a medium.
We learned from her that a 7-year-old girl...
...named Annabelle Higgins
had died in this apartment.
She was lonely and took a Liking
to my doll.
All she wanted was to be friends.
When we heard this,
we felt reality sorry for her.
I mean, we're nurses, we help people.
So...
...we gave her permission
to move into the doll.
ED-
Wait, you did what?
She wanted to Live with us
by inhabiting the doll.
We said yes.
But then things got worse.
{GIRLS LAUGHING}
God.
CAMILLA- When we came home,
she was sitting in the hallway.
But we had Left her in the spare room.
{ELECTRICITY CRACKLING}
{CAMILLA GASPS}
{WOODEN THUNK}
Debbie! Debbie, wait!
{BANGING ON DOOR}
{BANGING CONTINUES}
{BANGING ON DOOR}
{GASPS}
DEBBIE-
We are beyond terrified.
We don't know what's going on
or what to do. Can you help us?
Yes, we can.
Now, firstly, there's no such thing
as Annabelle, and there never was.
LORRAINE-
Ghosts don't possess such power.
I think what we have here is something
extremely manipulative.
It's something inhuman.
It was a big mistake acknowledging this doll.
And through that,
the inhuman spirit tricked you.
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.
What's an inhuman spirit?
It's something that's never walked
the earth in human form.
It's something demonic.
DEBBIE-
So the doll was never possessed?
No, no, it was used as a conduit.
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.
Demonic spirits don't possess things,
they possess people.
It wanted to get inside of you.
ED- All right, that's good, Drew.
You can shut it down now.
Hit the Lights.
So we got the church to send a priest over...
...to bless the house and the occupants.
Whatever was oppressing that apartment
was no Longer with them. Any questions?
{PEOPLE CHATTERING}
Yes.
Where's the doll now?
Someplace safe.
- Yep.
- So, what are you guys?
I mean, what do people call you?
Uh, well, we've been called Demonologists.
That's one name for us.
Ghost hunters, paranormal researchers.
- Kooks.
ALL- Ha-ha-ha.
Wackos.
But we prefer to be known simply
as Ed and Lorraine Warren.
{CHILDREN SINGING INDISTINCTLY}

Wow, hear that?

Or do I have no choice in that either?
Well, first cute boy she meets,

And there was a funky smell in my

What are we gonna do
with all this stuff?
Well, we probably ought

There might be some antiques down here
worth a lot.
Yeah, or just a lot of junk
the previous owner didn't want.
- It's ours now.
- Knock yourself out.
- I'm gonna make some coffee.
- Okay.
I'm gonna see if I can get
this furnace working.
Yeah, that'd be nice. It's freezing.
Yeah.
Hmm.

Mommy, where's Sadie?
She's outside. You know, I'm sure she's

- Sure.
- Sadie!
ROGER- Slow it down, Scoot.
CAROLYN- Roger.
- Yeah.
This clock stopped at 3-07,
and so did the one in the hallway.
That's weird.
Maybe it got knocked around in the move.
Speaking of knocked around,
what did you do to me Last night?
- Ouch. I didn't do that. Did I?
- I don't know.
Sadie!
{APRIL SCREAMING}

What's-? April! What's going on?
- What happened?
- Oh, my God!
Oh, Sadie.
ED-
We keep everything Locked in here.
Feel free to Look around.
Just don't touch anything.
Wow.
This is crazy.
So all these are taken from cases
you've investigated?
That's right. Everything you see
in here is either haunted, cursed...
...or has been used in some kind
of ritualistic practice.
Nothing's a toy.
Not even the toy monkey.
Don't touch it.
Oh, ahem. Well, isn't it scary,
or doesn't it worry you...
...to have all these items
right in your home?
That's why we have a priest that comes by
once a month to bless the room.
Well, the way I see it is-
It's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.
It's kind of Like keeping guns
off the street.
Why not just throw them
in an incinerator? Destroy them.
Well, that would only destroy the vessel.
Sometimes it's better to keep
the genie in the bottle.
Say, is the, uh, Annabelle doll here?
Right this way.
Yeah.
- You said she's a conduit?
- That's right.
What does that mean?
A very powerful demonic
has Latched itself onto her.
So when you guys investigate
these haunting...
...how do you stop them
from Latching onto you?
We have to take great precaution.
But what about your wife?
What about her?
Well, Father Gordon told me that-
Well, that was different.
What happened to my wife
happened during an exorcism.
Well, what's the difference?
{FLOORBOARD CREAKS}

I think kind of freaked her out.
- That's not good. What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.
- Honey, you got another bruise here.

Does that hurt?

I'm going with you.
I know you're worried
it's gonna happen again.
Yeah, I am. I reality am.
Maybe it's just time we take a break.
Write that book.
Do you remember what you said to me
on our wedding night?
"Can we do it again?"
After that.
{BOTH LAUGH}
You said that God brought us together
for a reason. Right?
I'm pretty sure it's not to write a book.

...these boards are gonna expand

because of these pipes Leading to the radiator.
So this place isn't haunted?
No, it rarely is.
Yeah, there's usually always
some kind of rational explanation.

What happened?
{ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY}
Somebody, goddamn it,
tell me what's going on here?
ED- Fear is defined as a feeling of agitation
and anxiety caused by the presence...
...or imminence of danger.
Whether it's a ghost, a spirit
or an entity, they all feed on it.
Take Maurice here.
A French-Canadian farmer with
no more than a third-grade education...
...yet after he was possessed,
spoke some of the best Latin I'd ever heard.
Sometimes backwards.
He'd been molested by his father,
who had also tortured him repeatedly.
A dark spirit made its home in this man.
Now, if you Look into his eyes,
you can see him tearing blood.
{AUDIENCE MUTTERING}
{MAURICE & PRIEST SPEAKING IN LATIN}
And Like that...
...an upside-down cross started
to appear from within his body.
ED-
All right, Drew, you can hit the Lights.
Oh.
WOMAN-
Did you personality perform the exorcism?
No, I'm not authorized.
But I've assisted on many.
See, an exorcism
can be very dangerous...
...not only for the victim,
but for anyone in the room.
- What happened to Maurice?
ED- He tried to kill his wife...
...but instead shot her in the arm
and then turned the gun on himself.
Maurice had a very troubled Life
with little to Live for...
...and not even an exorcist
could bring him back.
Which brings us to the three stages
of demonic activity-
Infestation, oppression and possession.
Now, infestation-
That's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence...
...which ultimately grows
into oppression, the second stage.
Now this is where the victim,
and it's usually the one...
...who's the most
psychologically vulnerable...
...is targeted specifically
by an external force.
Breaks the victim down.
Crushes their will.
And, once in a weakened state, Leads them
to the third and final stage- possession.
- Hey, Ed? Lorraine?
- Yeah.
There's someone here
that would Like to talk to you.
- Hi.
- Thanks, Drew.
- Thank you.
- I'll see you Later.
How can we help you?
There's something horrible happening in
my house. Could you come and take a Look?
You know, uh, it's getting kinda late.
- We reality need to head to our family.
- You don't understand.
But we do. There's usually some
sort of rational explanation-
I have five daughters who are scared to death.
I'm so afraid this thing wants to hurt us.
You have a daughter. Wouldn’t you do
anything you could to protect her? Please.
Please can you come and take a Look?
Of course we will.
Of course we will.

Hey, nice to meet you, Roger. Ed Warren.
- Thanks for coming.
- Please, come in.
Thank you.
So...
Oh, my God. Look at you all.
Who are these beautiful young women?
This is Andrea, the oldest,
Nancy, Cindy, Christine...
...and April.
It's Mr. and Mrs. Warren.
- We're all sleeping down here now.
LORRAINE- Mm.
The girls feel safer and it's warmer.
I'm constantly turning up the heat,
but the house is always freezing.
ROGER-
It's not a problem with the furnace.
I mean, not that I can find.
CAROLYN-
It's gotten a lot worse the past few nights.
There's this awful smell, Like rotting meat.
It moves around the house.
Uh...
What? What is it?
Well, rancid smells could indicate
some type of demonic activity.
Oh, my God.
ROGER- That's to keep those doors
from banging at night.
Otherwise, it's Like-
All night Long, just Like that.
- Does it come in threes?
- Yeah.
It stops at dawn?
Uh-huh.
Well, sometimes it's meant
as an insult to the Trinity-
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
ROGER- You know, it's the damndest thing,
but we also get all kinds of birds...
...that will just fly against the side
of the house and break their necks.
Hm. Really?
And the clocks stop at 3-07 a. m.
- All of them?
- Every one.
Oh, we were hanging those
along the stairs.
Something just kept knocking them down,
so we stopped hanging them up.
That's what I was talking about.
It was here when we moved in.
There's also a lot of stuff in the cellar.
Show me the cellar.
{DISTORTED SCREAMING}
WOMAN-
Look what she made me do.
You picking up anything in here, hon.?
Something awful happened here, Ed.
Those bruises, they from something
that happened here?
Oh, it's some iron deficiency thing I have.
You know, with all that's been going on,
why haven't you just moved out?
I don't know where
we'd move to, you know?
We got all our money tied up in this place
and had a lot of repairs on top of that.
And I don't know anybody whose gonna
take in a family of seven indefinitely.
That's why we tracked you down.
We're glad you found us.
All right, Let’s get started.
My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...
...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.
Okay, go ahead.
CAROLYN-
Where do I start?
From the first occurrence.
I guess it was the clocks.
Mom and Dad tell me
that you have a friend.
His name's Rory.
He lives here too.
- Hmm.
- But he's always sad.
Why is that?
He won't tell me but I think
something bad happened to him.
Do you mind if I try to see Rory?
{¶¶ MUSIC BOX PLAYING ¶¶}
{ED SIGHS}
Hey.
{ROPE SQUEAKING}
What is it?
{ROPE SQUEAKING}
We bought it at auction from the bank, so,
you know, we never knew who lived here.
Well, Lorraine and I both feel that
what your house needs is a cleansing.
An exorcism.
What, exorcism?
I thought that was something
that you do to people.
LORRAINE-
No, not necessarily, no.
We have to get out of here.
I'm afraid that's not gonna help.
Lorraine saw something, which-
Go ahead, hon.
I've been seeing the dark entity
that haunts your house...
...and your Land.
I saw it first when I came
through your door.
It was Latched to your back.
And then I saw it again with the girls
when we walked into the Living room.
And it doesn't matter where you go...
...this dark entity has Latched itself
to your family...
...and it's feeding off you.
Even if we Leave?
Sometimes when you get haunted,
it's Like stepping on gum.
You take it with you.
LORRAINE- Look, I gotta tell you,
you have a lot of spirits in here...
...but this is the one that I'm most
worried about, because it is so hateful.
Okay, so what do we do?
Can we call a priest?
ED-
I wish it were that easy.
Performing an exorcism is an archaic
procedure. Requires years of training.
And even then,
I have seen it go horribly wrong.
But before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.
It means we gotta investigate,
gather evidence and provide proof...
...and that's the hard part.
Have your children been baptized?
Uh, no, we never got around to that.
We're not reality a churchgoing family.
Well, you may want to rethink that.
Our presence here could make things worse.
Why?
Because we're a threat.
And whatever you're dealing with here
isn't gonna Like us.
So far it hasn't done anything violent,
and that's a good sign.
So we're gonna have our guy
do some homework on the property...
...to see what we're up against.
LORRAINE-
Judy, what are you up to?
- I got you a present.
- Aah.
Me and Nanna got these
at the church's yard sale.
- Honey.
- One for you and one for me.
LORRAINE- Aw.
JUDY- She put a picture...
...of you and Daddy in mine.
Nanna said this way
we'll always be together.
You'll be with me and I'll be with you.
I miss you and Daddy.
Hey, hon.
Yup.
You're not gonna believe this.
Carolyn's voice didn't record.
What do you mean?
Listen.
My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...
...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.
Okay, go ahead.
From the first occurrence.
Nothing.
The whole time.
- I don't know. You find anything?
- Lots.
I mean, it's no wonder they're
going through what they are.
That's the original farmhouse.
It was built in 1863 by a man
named Jedson Sherman...
...who was married to a woman
named Bathsheba.
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.
She was one of the women
accused of witchcraft in Salem.
- She was hung during the trials.
- Wow.
After Bathsheba married Jedson,
they had a baby...
...and when the baby was 7 days old...
...Jedson caught her sacrificing it
in front of the fireplace.
She ran out to that tree by the dock...
...climbed up, proclaimed her Love
to Satan...
...cursed anyone who tried
to take her Land, and hung herself.
Time of death was pronounced at 3-07
in the morning.
Well, that explains a few things.
Yeah, so does this.
Her Last name's Walker.
She lived there in the '30s.
She had a boy named Rory who
mysteriously disappeared in the woods.
Then she killed herself in the cellar.
And that's not all.
So, what was the original 200-acre farm
has since been subdivided and sold off.
There was another boy who drowned in
a pond here. He lived in a house over here.
And a woman who worked as a maid in a
neighbouring home, she committed suicide too.
People who took her Land.
ED {ON RECORDING}-
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...
...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.
Okay, go ahead.

LORRAINE-
Here's Brad.
- You find it okay?
BRAD- Oh, yeah.
Drew, this is Officer Brad.
Officer Brad Hamilton,
Harrisville, Rhode Island P.D.
Hm. Nice to meet you, man.
- So you're the Lucky new cop, huh?
- Guess so.
- You know you can't shoot ghosts, right?
- Take it easy on him, Drew.
All right, guys,
help me get this stuff unloaded.
You take this.
LORRAINE-
Hi, Roger.
All right. When you're finished here,
why don't you hit upstairs, all right, Drew?
You got it.
ED-
What's wrong with the Chevy?
Ugh, what's not wrong with her?
- Needs a new carburettor to start.
- Oh, yeah?
Kind of put fixing her up
on hold for a while.
Yeah. Ahem.
Hey, Brad, hand me a thermostat,
would you?
What's this, uh, do?
When there's an instant drop
in temperature...
...the thermostat
triggers the camera to take a picture.
You've actuality caught things on film?
Well, yeah, that's, uh, the point.
Why, uh-? Why out here?
Well, this is where the witch
committed suicide.
She hung herself from that branch
right above where you're standing.
CAROLYN-
How could a mother kill her own child?
It was never a child to her.
She just used her God-given gift
as the ultimate offense against him.
Witches believe it elevates their status
in the eyes of Satan.
{GIRLS GIGGLING}
Mm.
Wow.
That's a nice day at the beach, huh?
How did you know?
It's an insight. It's Like a peek through
the curtain into another person's Life.
Mm.
That day meant so much to me.
We were driving along the coast.
Nancy pointed out
how pretty the view was.
I thought this is a perfect opportunity
for a photo.
We're gonna start fresh, you know?
A new house, a new beginning.
You should have seen Roger and the girls.
I've never seen them so happy.
ALL-
Cheese!
They mean the world to me.
DREW-
Put your hand flat on the desk.
Yeah, and take it off.
Here we go.
See?
It just reveals to us what
the naked eye can't see.
Pretty far out, isn't it?
Yeah, it's groovy.
Drew, you got the Bolex ready for Brad?
Yeah, already Locked and Loaded, sir.
{BELL TINKLING & DOOR CREAKING}
{TOILET FLUSHES}
What? I had to go.
DREW-
All the rooms are coming in pretty good.
Good.
What's in the bottle?
Holy water.
Presence of religious icons...
...will get a reaction
from anything unholy.
Sort of pisses them off.
So I set these throughout the house,
see if I can stir things up a bit.
ROGER- Like holding a cross to a vampire?
ED- Yeah. Exactly.
Except I don't believe in vampires.
{BELL TINKLING}

Okay.
All right, it's 9-18, we're headed down into the

I have Lorraine and Officer Brad Hamilton
with me.
Let's keep the cellar Light off.
Give us a sign that you wanna
communicate with us.
{LOW DRONING}
Hon, you all right?
There's definitely something here.
- All right, close the door. Move something.
- My hands are so cold.
Come on.
LORRAINE-
No.
It's gone. It's gone.
ED-
I got nothing.
Okay.
ED- Well, Like I said, it doesn't always work
when you want it to.
Yeah, maybe the camera picked
something up.
BRAD-
Watch out!
DREW-
For a guy who doesn't believe...
...you Looked a little freaked out
when that door slammed shut.
It must have been a draft.
Oh, that's funny.
A draft never put that Look
on my face before.
I believe the clock.
It's 3-08.
{ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY}
Let me see your glasses.
For you.
I think I might take some girls for ice cream
Later on. What do you say about that?
GIRLS- Yeah!
ROGER- Honey, you wanna come?
I'm exhausted. I'm just gonna take a nap.
The late nights are getting to me.
That's probably a good idea.
Why don't you get some rest.
- Lorraine and I'll watch over things for a bit.
- Really?
I'm gonna take off.
I have a shift starting in an hour.
The house hasn't felt Like this
in a Long time.
I think the kids feel a lot safer
with you around.
ED- I could get used to this.
- What, me doing Laundry?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You're funny.
No, this place.
Nice, fresh country air.
They have such a beautiful family,
don't they?

I'll sell you this one.
{LAUGHING}
Hey, hand me a wrench, would you?
Hey, uh, it reality means a lot
to us to have you here.
I gotta admit, I was a little
bit sceptical going in.
Just wanna say thank you, though,
for coming out when you did.
I can't take the credit.
That's, uh- That's all Lorraine.
- I didn't want to.
- Oh. Why's that?
Whatever Lorraine sees, feels, touches,
it helps people.
But it also takes a toll on her.
Little piece each time.
Couple months ago
we were working on a case.
She saw something.
{PRIEST PRAYING IN LATIN}
{SCREAMING}
It took a real big piece.
When we got home...
...she went into our room,
Locked herself in...
...didn't talk, didn't eat,
didn't come out for eight days.
What'd she see?
{LORRAINE SCREAMING}

The approval would have to come
directly from the Vatican.
Father, we've never seen nothing Like this.
Yeah, well, neither have I.
