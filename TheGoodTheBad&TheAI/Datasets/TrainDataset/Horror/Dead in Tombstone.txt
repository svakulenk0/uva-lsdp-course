BLACKSMITH: The West...
People call it
"The New Frontier."
It sounds almost nice.
They'll tell you it's built
on the backs of God-fearing
folks
with true grit in their hands
and the American Dream
in their hearts.
Well, whoever wrote
that's sellin' snake oil,
sure as shit.
The real West is a heartless,
lawless viper pit.
An American nightmare,
forged by the flames of hell
and the hammer of the beast.
I oughta know.
I am Lucifer
and I devour the souls of men.
In the West,
I never go hungry.
Red Cavanaugh.
Murdering son of a bitch.
Open up!
PREACHER: Do you renounce
the evil powers of this world
that corrupt and destroy
the creatures of God?
Do you renounce
the sinful desires
that draw you from
the love of God?
I got the beast
in me, Father.
In his name
I will spill the blood of
every bull in this yard,
before that sun rises.
Guerrero!
Guerrero!
Guerrero!
MAN: Yeah!
His six months
in hell are over.
Gracias.
De nada.
RED: Hey, Baptiste,
I don't know what smells
worse, you or that shit
you're making.
Thought you
were French.
You want me to
shovel it up your cul?
Hey, hey, enough,
eat it!
Do you want some?
Fuck, no.
Still having them
nightmares?
I seen him.
Seen who?
The demon that haunts
my dreams.
Sure it was him?
It's my penance.
RED: Hermano,
I got us a big score.
Could set us up for life.
Get us off this
hand-to-mouth shit
we been doing.
I'm listening.
RED: It's a Colorado town.
They got 'em a stone
and quartz quarry.
Devil stones from Yuma prison
come from there.
Town called Edendale.
God's country.
Turns out, they struck
a vein of gold.
Big one.
GUERRERO: When?
RED: Few months ago.
What else?
Well...
They been banking
the gold up
because they got a little
mineral rights dispute
happening.
You got no right,
Judah Clark, you
got no right!
Mineral rights
on the deed are
plain as day!
They belong to Edendale
and its founding members.
And you're staring
at the first one!
If you could read,
you would see that
they say
you have the right
to pull gypsum from
the quarry.
That is all.
Mineral rights
is mineral rights!
And everybody's
gettin' greedy.
JACK: Goddamned limey bastard!
And I suggest you hold
your tongue when it comes
to Mother England,
you tin-pan mongrel!
Hey!
God damn it, Jack!
Do you want to spend
the night in the hole?
Guy on the inside
says the sheriff's
getting real cagey, right?
SHERIFF MASSEY:
I am sworn to uphold the law.
And the law says
all mineral disputes
gotta be settled by
the federal judge in Denver.
RED: He's so stupid.
He didn't wanna move
the land transport to
Denver.
He didn't wanna hire
personal security.
Till then, said goddamned
minerals will be impounded
by local authorities.
That's me.
Take it to the vault.
And the sheriff's
keepin' the gold vaulted
till they all settle.
In the bank?
That's stupid.
Now, personally,
I don't care who
owns the gold.
What I care about
is this town.
And I will be goddamned
if I let it burn on account
of greed and graft.
Who else knows?
Far as I know, just me.
You sure about this?
Never more, hermano.
It's two hard days'
ride to Colorado.
We ride at first light.
Rojo.
About your stretch...
No hard feelings?
Forgive and forget.
Shit, I know things
ain't panned out
in the past.
This is different,
hermano.
This is different.
We're square.
Bueno.
Come on, quickly...
Let's go!
What men?
Have you seen
them before?
VERA: You should go get
your husband. Yeah.
LIZA: That's a good idea.
Afternoon, boys.
SHERIFF MASSEY: Honey,
we're a little busy, here,
right now.
Well, I guess Greedy
and Seedy, over here,
can't handle their affairs
like a couple of men.
And, speakin' of which,
a gang of gunfighters
just rode into town.
Reckon they're headed
for the saloon.
DEPUTY MORRIS:
How you know
they're gunfighters?
CALATHEA:
Just a hunch, really.
Seein' as they're all
splattered in blood and
bristling with blue steel.
JUDAH: That is rather
disquieting, Sheriff.
Perhaps you should
go and talk to them.
SHERIFF MASSEY: About what,
Judah? Ain't it legal to
pack iron in this county?
Now, we got laws,
here in Edendale.
Soon as you see one of them
James Gang in the saloon
breaking one,
you come and tell me.
Until that moment,
we've got business
we need to settle here.
Home, sweet
home, brother.
Darko, whiskey.
BARTENDER: Good afternoon.
What're you havin'?
DARKO: Whiskey!
Come here,
come here.
Well, it doesn't look
like a town laden
with gold, Red.
I told you boys,
they're havin' a land
dispute in this town.
Gold's all locked up
till the judge makes
a decision.
WASHINGTON: I can't believe
they stored it all in
that shit box of a bank.
RAMOS: The bank is easy
either way, you know?
Even if they don't
have any gold,
we could use the cash.
BAPTISTE:
Maybe stick around.
Get some putas.
Hey...
We do the job
and that's it.
But we hit the bank tonight.
RAMOS: Yeah.
Yeah, cheers.
GUERRERO: You make sure
the sheriff and his men
don't get in our way.
Darko, Baptiste,
you watch our back
on Saloon Street.
We don't want no surprises.
Rojo.
Yeah, brother.
Come for the gold,
nothing more.
Nobody dies,
unless they're
asking for it.
Now, I don't want your temper
making heroes out of folks
that would otherwise
just let it be.
Sí.
Vámonos.
CALATHEA:
I was talking with the girls
about it this afternoon.
SHERIFF MASSEY:
Yeah, what did they say?
CALATHEA: Well, let me get
you a strong drink.
Wait, give me a kiss, first.
Love you, baby.
Love you, sweetie.
SHERIFF MASSEY:
Smells good.
Evening.
Hey...
Deputies...
Cheers.
CALATHEA:
And, Sheriff.
One more.
I told you, it's not...
It's not the stove
that's gonna be...
GUERRERO: You got
enough dynamite?
WASHINGTON: Never
enough dynamite.
WASHINGTON: This is
gonna get loud.
GUERRERO: Got it, got it.
MAN: Get down!
SHERIFF MASSEY: Calathea!
Calathea! You
all right?
DARKO: No need to be
a hero, Sheriff!
Hey, just stay put.
Boys and I are gonna
take care of this.
SNAKE: Just stay inside,
with your little wife!
If anyone tries to come in
through that door that
ain't us,
you shoot 'em.
GUERRERO: Washington,
go get the wagon.
Go on!
All right.
GUERRERO: Look at
all the gold.
RED: You doubted me?
Nicely done,
little brother.
JACK: Sheriff, you okay?
SNAKE: Ramos.
Save your positions!
JACK: Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Jack!
Let's get over to the bank,
we can still save the gold!
I don't care if they
get the gold.
You gotta protect
the families.
I am deputizing you,
as of now.
You and your boys are to
position yourself behind
Saloon Street,
near them houses, okay?
Now, go!
Go get 'em.
Lord protect us.
Okay.
SNAKE: Two... One... Go!
RAMOS: Ah, surprise, cabrones!
RAMOS: Fucking bitch!
You wanna play with
the big boys, huh?
Out of bullets.
Keep your eyes open!
Where are they?
Baptiste!
MAN: There they are!
Come on, take a shot!
This is
the sheriff!
Stop where you are
and put your hands up!
BAPTISTE: Put it down!
Didn't I tell you
to stay inside?
Slowly...
If you wanna live.
GUERRERO: Rojo, vámonos.
Hermano, what's
the hurry?
To the victor go
the spoils, huh?
GUERRERO: What are
you talking about?
Ow, ah, ah, ah!
Okay, okay!
Ow, ah!
Rojo!
CALATHEA: You're hurting me!
We need to get out of here!
CALATHEA: No!
GUERRERO: Leave
these people alone!
SHERIFF MASSEY:
Calathea!
Bob, no!
Calathea!
Bob!
Ah!
No! No!
Rojo, what is
wrong with you?
No!
What are you doing?
We've got the gold, vámonos!
CALATHEA: No!
Maybe I want to stay.
And go back to prison?
Federal marshals will be here.
Marshals ain't comin',
hermano.
I ain't goin' back
to prison.
The wagons are loaded.
And we're leaving, now!
Brother, I got
a better idea now.
I'm gonna stay here
and I'm gonna take
over this town.
And you can go to hell.
Put your guns
down, boys.
Unless you got something
against bein' rich.
GUERRERO:
I raised you, Rojo.
You're my brother.
I'm your half-brother.
The only blood we share
is from a whore in Juárez.
Shoot him!
Shoot him!
RED: Go ahead.
Pull that iron, boys.
You wanna take orders
from a dead man?
Or you can take
orders from me.
What the fuck
is that?
RED: This here's
the deed...
The deed that says
that I own the gold
mine now.
It was signed over to me.
I'm gonna own it all.
Why don't you read
it to 'em, Snake?
Yeah...
RED: Tell 'em how it looks.
Hmm.
Looks legit.
You think money's
gonna make you a man?
I'm man enough to take
out Guerrero De La Cruz,
right?
You're getting
soft, brother.
This gang needs
a new leader.
You been king long enough.
Now I'm mayor.
I'm sheriff.
I'm Jesus H. Christ
in this town.
From now on,
people will know the
name Red Cavanaugh.
You boys are gonna be
the richest goddamned
deputies
in the history
of law enforcement.
There is no
honor among you.
Backstabbing traitor.
Boys, what do you say
we give my big brother here
a nice retirement party?
I'll see you again, Rojo.
I'll see all of you.
In hell!
Gentlemen, there will
be men like us
who're gonna think
that they can take
this town.
So, the name's
gotta remind 'em
just what's waitin' for 'em
if they try.
From now on,
the name of this
town is Tombstone.
BLACKSMITH: Guerrero.
BLACKSMITH: Guerrero.
You're mine.
There is never a sound
so sweet as that of
the pitiful sufferer.
The demon from my dreams,
I've seen you.
Oh, I've been
waiting for you.
I've been waiting for you.
Where am I?
Somewhere...
South of heaven.
I was shot.
Struck down by your
own flesh and blood.
I'm dead?
I'm dead.
This is hell!
I don't belong here!
Uh, excuse me?
You don't belong here?
That's what they all say.
But you're still
of the flesh. Hmm?
Until I burn it away.
If it's true that men
like me feed the
fires of hell,
I will bring you more fuel
for your fire than my soul
alone could ever supply.
Are you trying to
make a deal with me?
It's been a pleasure.
Wait, wait, wait...
A trade!
My soul for the soul
of my half-brother and the
cabrones that betrayed me,
the Blackwater Gang!
Well, that is an
interesting proposition.
One day, 24 hours.
What's that,
compared to eternity?
I'll give it some thought.
One day!
One day, 24 hours!
What's that,
compared to eternity?
Why should I accept it?
I already have you.
They are six. I am one.
They are thieves,
killers and traitors,
who will sell their own mother
for a sack of gold.
Give me just one day
and I'll deliver all
six of their souls,
including that no good,
lowlife brother of mine,
Red Cavanaugh.
You get all six of them,
in exchange for my own soul.
Their souls will feed
the fires of hell higher
and give you
great pleasure,
right now.
Hmm.
An intriguing wager.
GUERRERO: I'll deliver
all six of their souls.
Give me just one day.
I will grant
you one day.
One day...
But all six men
must die by your hand
and by your hand, alone.
If you succeed,
I will give you
your wretched life.
And if you fail,
then the misery
that awaits you will
be a thousandfold.
Do we have a deal?
SNAKE: Whoa!
Nobody touches the tables!
One turn of the clock.
Not a second longer.
You take your revenge
and deliver my souls.
Now you will go
the same way you came.
Liza?
Why would Sully fix the
goddamn clock and then
leave the hole in it?
LIZA: He didn't.
Baby, he
must've fixed it.
Couldn't have.
Mama, if you're so
damn set on keepin'
that pie hole open,
why don't you go upstairs
and take daddy up there
and let me give you
somethin' to do with it?
Come on, bubba,
come on, now.
MAN: Go get her, Red.
It's been one year.
It's been one year
to the day.
Boo!
WOMAN: Did he get
scared?
MAN: Ain't got a Chinaman's
chance of working.
Come on.
Come on.
Go put my horse
in the barn. Go!
Yes, sir.
Ah!
Puta madre, get out
of my sight! Go!
Yes, sir.
Clean that again.
Yes, sir.
Red wants it by dawn.
One year to the day.
Impossible.
It's completely impossible.
Do you hear that?
What is it, boss?
GUERRERO:  Ramos.
Huh?
Who's there?
Get the pistola.
Come with me.
Duke?
Yeah?
What's going on?
Who is there?
Who's there?
Hey. Who is it?
What the fuck?
Ah!
Who the hell
are you?
Are you pretty fast
with that pistola?
I don't have
to be fast, señor.
Unless you're gonna
shoot me with your
pecker. Hmm?
I have a pretty nice gun
right here.
There are two people in this
world that know how to put
that gun together.
One of them is dead.
What the hell?
Now you're talking.
You remember me...
The Lord told me
about you in a dream.
Said I'd be tempted
by a demon from hell.
Lord, please,
remove this cup from me,
your humble servant.
Amen.
I'm still here, padre.
I'm not a demon.
What are you, then?
A customer.
A drink
to soften the revelation.
Shit.
Mister, if you threaten
the reverend again,
I will shame
this holy place
with your blood.
Now, if you two
wanna keep breathing,
you'd better
do as I say.
What's your business
here, stranger?
Do you have any pine boxes
in your stores?
Why? Are you
an undertaker?
Somethin' like that.
How many do you need?
Six.
God ain't gonna
help you, amigo.
Just leave a little silver
in the collection box.
Come on,
give me some.
Come on.
Viens ici!
Viens!
MAN 1: What is it, boss?
MAN 2: What is it?
MAN 3: Shooter's probably
around here somewhere.
Probably still here.
Whoever is inside,
get out here now!
Cover me.
Got it.
MAN 4:
Get your lollygagging...
Get in there.
Come on, I've got
a fistful of lead for you,
right now. Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Watch it.
Got anything, boys?
No.
Nope.
MAN: Let's go.
This is for Ramos.
GUERRERO:
All that money
and you still can't
take a bath.
How do you know my...
Can't be!
It is.
We killed you.
No, this is how
you kill someone.
For the great day
of his wrath is come
and who shall be
left to stand?
Reverend Paul,
you can't go in there.
I have heard tales
of black angels,
come back to destroy
the evils of the Earth.
No soy angel, padre,
but I suggest you leave
till my business is through.
The church is my place.
You... You bleed.
You are of flesh
and blood.
You were a part
of the Blackwater Gang,
when they took the town.
I watched them bury you.
It's a long story.
And my time is short.
Are you here to kill
Red and his men?
Unless they kill me first.
Well, I don't care if you
are the spawn of hell.
I'll ride with you.
It's personal.
Red Cavanaugh murdered
my husband in cold blood.
Ain't nothin' more
personal than that.
You can dance
on his grave.
But until I'm through,
stay out of my way.
Look, you may be good,
but they've got numbers.
Red hired up a lot of guns
since he took the town.
Let us help.
Us?
We've been praying
for someone to bring
justice.
Been a year.
Nobody's come.
No marshals,
no law of any kind.
And trust me,
we've sent letters,
telegrams, we even
went to Denver.
Seems like Red's got himself
some friends in high places.
So you see,
we gotta stick together.
You don't hear too good,
do you, lady?
Nobody can kill
them but me.
Now,
I suggest you clear out,
'cause they'll be back
sooner or later.
Where the hell
is Baptiste?
Was he a part of that
ruckus this morning?
That man loves a fight.
Dead, boss.
Ramos, too.
What the hell are
you talking about?
I seen 'em boxed up.
All right, boys.
Let's go pay
our respects, huh?
Come on.
Come on.
Whiskey.
You from around here?
Not exactly.
Can I help you
with somethin'?
Leave the bottle.
Yes, sir.
Well, you know
what they say,
"If you're looking
for someone..."
"Just head to the saloon."
Expect it'll be getting
lively around here in
a while.
Who're the empty
ones for?
Are you
fucking stupid?
Son of a bitch!
SNAKE: We can't
just let them rot.
Ain't good
for business.
No.
That's exactly what
we're gonna do.
We're gonna kill
this man tonight.
I don't give a shit
who's with him.
Listen better,
if you boys fuck this up,
I'm gonna put you in these
caskets myself.
Who you think
did it?
Who gives a shit?
He's a dead man.
Washington,
get up to the mine
and crack the whip,
we got a delivery tonight
come hell or high water,
and we better be even, boy.
All right.
We're gonna get payback.
Shut the fuck up.
Hey.
What the hell are
you doing here?
You know, I always
loved that expression.
I still got time.
Hmm...
Oh, brother, let me
tell you something.
Time is half gone.
Yet your quarry
is still half alive.
Yeah, I'm wasting
it talking to you.
Listen, hombre,
I want that
little maricón.
I want that Red Cavanaugh's
ass and I want it now.
I want his blood
and you're gonna
bring it to me.
Now, I don't
want nothing...
Not a goddamn thing
to distract you, okay?
None of your pussy, none of
your whores, none of all these
preacher friends, all these...
All these fuckers that are
gonna be talkin' about all
this righteous shit...
"His goodness"
and all that, you know?
I know you better
than you know yourself
and I can smell
your conscience.
Makes me wanna puke.
Ah!
Jesus Christ.
Hey, hey, hombre.
Hey, I'm watching
everything.
Everything, okay?
Can't pull the wool
over my eyes, boy.
Never forget why
I brought you here.
High noon, hombre.
RED: Right up
to the saloon, boys.
Come on, move it.
You better be right
about this, son.
Get out! Move out!
Move out. Put them up.
Shh...
I don't know who you
think you are, stranger,
but if you've come to my town
lookin' for trouble?
You just found plenty.
It's been a while, huh, Rojo?
Only one man's ever
called me that.
And he's dead
and buried.
Some things don't
stay buried, Rojo.
My brother is dead.
I seen the blood
drain out of him
when I put the bullet
in his heart.
I killed you once.
Never again.
RED: We don't have
to do this, brother.
There's plenty of gold
to go round.
I prefer lead.
RED: I'll tell you what,
come on out
and I'll cut you in
on your fair share.
We'd be square. Deal?
I already made a deal.
All I gotta do now
is collect.
Take him down!
Take him down!
I'll take him down.
I ain't gonna miss
the next one.
Just wanted you to
know who killed you.
Are you out of
your mind, woman?
You're goddamn right.
You with my brother?
Not exactly.
But he is my inspiration.
You killed my husband...
Huh?
...and now you're gonna
die for your sins.
No!
The law man's wench,
she will be the end
of you.
So stay sharp, Guerrero.
This is the work
of the devil.
Son of a bitch.
Why did you
let Red go?
I had him dead
to rights.
I have to kill him.
Why?
Mister, after what we just
witnessed, there ain't no tale
too tall that can explain it.
It's my only escape
from damnation.
Deliver the souls of Red
and the Blackwater Gang
to the devil to save mine.
And I have to kill
him myself,
and I have till
midnight to do it.
Well, maybe you
have to kill them,
but I got a dog
in this fight,
and there ain't nothin'
that says I can't help.
REVEREND PAUL:
You're casting your
lot in with a killer
knowing full well
that the devil is
his keeper?
This is about justice
being served, Reverend.
I don't care
who's serving it.
Your soul is at
stake here, young lady.
Reverend, the fires of hell
are a Sunday picnic compared
to my pain.
Come on.
I wanna show
you something.
GUERRERO:
You're stronger
than you look.
I had some help.
JACK: Cal.
Reverend Paul...
We spotted Red Cavanaugh
on our way into town.
Headed to the mines,
more than likely.
We'd like you to know
we're here to help.
Please, Jack.
There are eternal
consequences to your actions.
Lest we be damned.
Give this town back to us
and you'll have the
rest of your life to
atone for the sins
of the life that
you left behind.
GUERRERO: Defend yourselves.
Protect your town.
But any of the
Blackwater boys,
you leave to me.
Show me the way
to the mines.
RED: All right,
all right, all right.
How we doing
down here, boys?
I don't think
we can hit 100.
No, you gotta get
to 200, Washington,
or you're gonna have
a large-size problem here.
All right,
everybody listen up,
we're three months
behind on deliveries
and he's coming to collect.
He can help us hack it out
of the goddamned walls
if he wants.
We have nothing to hide.
Washington, he's the least
of our problems at this point.
You tellin' me
the stranger's
still breathin'?
Yeah, what I'm telling you
is he ain't no damn stranger.
Who is he?
He's my brother.
Yeah, right.
Close your mouth,
you're drawing flies.
GUARD 1: Someone's
coming up the road.
You better identify
yourselves.
You've got three seconds.
GUERRERO: One,
two,
three.
All right, he's here.
All right. Let's go, guys.
Grab your pistols.
Let's go, boys.
Let's move.
Come on, fall in.
Time to kill my
brother. Again.
RED: Back up.
Back the fuck up
or I'll kill you.
Back up.
JUDAH: Now what's
all this then?
Are we having
a spot of trouble?
Judah Clark?
And you brought marshals.
Thank God.
No, thank me.
GUERRERO: Get down!
Hello, Cal.
Yes,
I think you should stay
down until all this
gets sorted out.
Hey, limey!
I just came for Red.
Why don't you come
and get your boy?
JUDAH: Red,
is this the fellow that's
been putting your men
on display at the chapel?
Yeah, but me and the boys
are taking care of it,
obviously.
Really? Because just
the opposite appears
to be the case.
I pay you to run this
operation and keep
our interests secure,
which clearly they are not.
Which begs the question,
where's my gold?
Oh, you're gonna
get it, Judah.
You're gonna get it.
You're the one
protecting him?
The federal courts were going
to let the mining rights
revert to Edendale.
So if I wanted control
of the mine,
I simply needed
control of the town.
Mr. Cavanaugh here
provides that control.
And I...
I pay off all
the right people.
So,
if I don't see every
ounce of my gold,
I'll take my men
and leave you in the
predicament in which
I found you.
Snake,
come on down here.
It's here.
It's here.
Well, gentlemen,
we seem to finally have
got our accounts in order.
Red, my apologies.
Please allow me to
take care of this
for you.
Kill them both.
Fire!
SNAKE: Hold on a second.
Bob, Jim, check it out.
SNAKE: I guess you
get what you pay for.
Can I?
Hell, no.
We got good equipment
down there.
Do better.
Fuck!
Do it.
About time.
Let's see you
get out of that.
Let them rot
in there.
Washington?
Let's go,
come on.
There's only five
hours left. We
need to hurry.
What are you doing?
A cigar?
Only way I'll get
rid of them.
CALATHEA: That's it!
We're almost back in town.
Okay, keep it steady.
Yah!
RED: Cut him off!
SNAKE: Dynamite!
Ah!
Oh, oh, oh!
No!
Come on!
No!
Yah!
RED: Come on and get me!
Guerrero!
Come here.
Let her go, Red.
You want this?
You want this, huh?
RED: Come and get me.
Come and get me!
Ah!
GUERRERO: Hold on!
I'm coming for you, Red.
Get up.
Move it.
MAN: Cover me!
SNAKE: Hey, boss,
okay if I still
call you that?
I got the girl.
She's a pretty one.
I'm gonna have
to kill her now.
Unless you come on out.
Girl's dead
either way.
If I come out
and somebody
kills me,
who's gonna kill you?
He ain't coming
back for you.
He doesn't give a shit
about you or your town.
Yeah.
I assure you.
I won't kill her if
you give yourself up.
I'll kill you for certain.
But I swear,
I won't kill her.
And you know
I'm good for it.
You'd even laugh
about that, remember?
A man that's good for his word
with a name like Snake.
You even had a word for it.
What was it?
Irony.
BLACKSMITH: Snake eyes.
And now it looks like
it's your turn to roll
the bones, shooter.
TOWNSMAN: We want
our town back!
MAN 1: Payback time!
MAN 2: We want revenge!
Move up!
Move up! Come on!
You stay here.
CALATHEA: All right.
But I'm afraid the odds
favor the house.
Ah!
Your priority was simple,
even if the task was not.
The law man's wench,
she's a distraction.
And you could have done
it if you weren't such
a pathetic coward.
I don't regret
what I did.
I don't give a fuck.
It matters to me.
Let's cross that bridge
when the time comes.
Honey...
Oh, yee-haw.
Must be real lonely
being a widow and all,
huh?
Huh?
We can do this
the hard way
if you want.
I always did like
breakin' ponies.
You're gonna
have to kill me
and conjugate your
putrid fantasy with
my corpse,
you horse's ass.
Why don't you untie me?
Why don't you come fight
me like a real man?
GUARD: Red, come down here!
Hold on, now.
I got a little bit
of business to square.
Then I'm gonna be back up
here with spurs on.
Boys?
Tie her back up
and do not fuck
it up this time.
GUARD: Got it, boss.
RED: If you boys are good,
I'll give you a shot
after mine, all right?
No!
I should like to
propose a toast.
To an excellent
partnership.
I'll drink to that.
You're looking a little
the worse for wear, Red.
Have you finally got
Tombstone under control?
Never was out of control.
I lost some men,
won't be the first time,
and sure as shit
won't be the last.
JACK: Red Cavanaugh?
Judah Clark?
Where are you?
Is this your idea
of control...
Shut your fucking mouth.
JACK: Look outside,
Judah Clark.
The folk that you betrayed.
Easy, Jack.
I'm sure we can settle
this like civilized men.
Your greed...
Greed of both
of you mongrels
brought all the evil
on this town.
Here's where it ends.
Please, Jack.
Don't mix me in
with these heathens.
I'm just a man
of business.
Heathens, huh?
Heathens?
Don't fucking
move, boy.
You think I'm fucking
around with you, boy?
Looks like this
business is closed.
Come on, I need
you now, bitch.
Let's go.
Where?
Let's go, princess!
I need you out.
Come on, get up.
Let's go. Get!
If it is your desire
to pay penance for
your despicable life,
brother, let me tell you,
you will pay dearly.
Your debt to me
remains unpaid.
But this wager amuses me.
You have one hour.
One hour.
Back up, boy,
back up, right now!
I gave you all life
in this goddamn town.
Back up! Back up!
I told you to back up!
Stop right there,
Red Cavanaugh.
You ain't going no place.
I made this town.
I put money in all
your pockets!
I made you all rich!
Now get the fuck off me!
I own all of you.
MAN: Nice night
for hanging, Red.
MAN: You're going
straight to hell.
RED: Now you're
a hero, huh?
Is that it?
No, Rojo,
not a hero.
Just an outlaw,
like you.
Let's get
this settled
once and for all.
Stop hiding
behind the girl.
Let her go.
And we'll let the good people
of Edendale make sure it's
a fair fight this time.
Put it down, Jack.
Put it down.
You once said you had huevos
big enough to take out
Guerrero De La Cruz.
You don't, hermanito,
and you never will.
There's one box left
and it's for you.
You just called
your mother a whore.
CALATHEA: All right, Guerrero,
only two minutes left.
Why?
RED: Guerrero!
Ah!
You think I'm fucking
around with you, brother?
This time, stay dead.
Tell Mama I died like a man.
BLACKSMITH: Guerrero,
you're mine.
BLACKSMITH:
Guerrero is my soul.
It's two minutes after.
I really wanna thank you.
Thank you.
BLACKSMITH:
Oh, boy.
You got what you wanted.
Now leave me alone.
Hey, listen,
Red Cavanaugh expired
two minutes past midnight.
You failed.
And you of all people
should know what the
fuck I want.
There is no end to
what I want, brother.
Then why am I still
above ground?
Well, let's look at it
this way, I have come
to enjoy your partnership.
What can I say?
I gorge myself on
the souls of evil men,
and you breathe
the air of life.
GUERRERO: When will
my debt be paid?
Well, when every last
fucking outlaw is dead,
huh?
How does that sound?
This is the West.
There's no shortage
of bad guys.
What can I say, partner?
You're my
devil's outlaw.
They say God made man
in his own image.
Unfortunately, you were
made in mine.
Guerrero!
Guerrero!
Guerrero!
