She's totally sober
saying that, I swear.
I swear.
Totally sober.
Time to cut.
Not!
The mob goes
wild, wild, wild
Ahh!
Ahh! I'm having so much fun.
Are you videoing this?
This is the best trip ever.
Can I have a kiss?
Mwah.
All right, here we are--
Mardi Gras.
Uh, when is it?
I don't know when it is.
But we're in Mardi Gras.
It's fuckin' awesome.
Give disease
so the swine who marry
Tough luck
for elected officials
The beast you see
got 50 eyes
Now all the odds
are in our favor
Save the victory speeches
for later
Who is this kid?
Hey, Russia, I'll introduce you.
Russia.
Meet my new buddy, the Russian.
Russia!
Damitri? Damitri.
Dmitri. Hey.
Dmitri.
Dmitri's
over here studyin',
but he's going to, uh,
jump in a car with us,
and we're gonna take him
over to Jack's.
Anybody hurt?
I don't know.
I was just driving.
Baby, you all right?
You sure you're not hurt anywhere?
Oh, my God,
look at my car!
Look at this.
It's a fuckin' mess.
Does anybody have
a working phone?
It doesn't matter.
There's no signal.
How in the hell are we
gonna get outta here?
I'm with you.
Relax.
Oh, you're cut.
It's nothing.
Just a little glass hit me.
Look at the state
of this fucking thing, huh?
Look at the window.
It's gonna be okay.
You were lucky.
Just take it easy.
So damn lucky,
man.
Don't cry.
I gotta take a piss.
Jude, come on, man.
Move on.
You're not even
together anymore.
Movin' on.
He's frickin'
welcome to her.
Mmhh.
Jesus Christ!
Ohh! Uhh!
Motherfucker!
Fuck!
What is it?
You hit him.
That's impossible.
I didn't see him.
Did you guys see him?
Check his pulse!
I don't like doing--
Aah! Motherfucker!
Oh, come on!
He bled in my mouth!
Fuck!
Oh, my God! What--
How badly
is he hurt?
We need to help him!
Oh, and he's in a
fuckin' hospital gown!
Calm down!
He could have anything!
Jesus Christ!
We have to help him.
Bobby, help me, please.
We gotta do something.
Oh, you gotta be
fuckin' kidding me!
Hey, over here!
Over here!
Here!
Over here!
Yeah! Hey!
Yeah, come on,
come on.
Uh, there's-- S-Some guy
came out from nowhere, man.
Over here, man.
There's somebody on the ground.
He's wearing
a hospital gown.
Can you tell me
what happened?
The guy came
from out of nowhere.
Is he gonna be okay?
That's him.
Easy.
Come on.
Easy.
On 3.
Jesus.
Easy, buddy.
Let's go.
Come on, buddy.
On 3, baby. Ready?
What the hell is this
guy doing out here?
He freaked out
before surgery and ran.
The drugs do that
sometimes.
We've been looking for
this guy for hours.
Doc is gonna
be pissed, man.
I heard that.
Um, you know, you guys
look pretty banged up.
You might need some
medical attention.
What about the car?
Uh, well, you know, I think
the most important thing
right now
is your health.
I mean, we can call
a tow truck if you want.
If you want
to hop in...
Okay.
Just watch your step.
That's it.
Now you, cowboy.
Watch your step, buddy.
There you go.
Everything's
gonna be okay.
I can't believe
this is happening.
He's not gonna make it.
He's dying.
Oh, that's nice.
You a fuckin' doctor?
You're gonna be okay.
We're almost
at the hospital.
You're gonna make it.
Okay?
No!
Okay, everybody.
Come on out.
Watch your step,
darlin'.
It's very slippery here.
Careful.
There you go.
Nice and easy.
Step out.
It's slippery.
It'll be okay, son.
It'll be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Don't worry.
Everyone, please.
Please take a seat.
Thank you.
Aren't we a bunch
of lucky ducks?
Now, is anyone experiencing
any dizziness,
shortness of breath,
or pain?
My n-- My neck
is really sore.
Oh, probably whiplash.
We'll take a look.
Yeah, ma'am, uh,
I-- I swallowed
a ton of that guy's
blood, so--
All right.
Well, nothin' serious.
Nothing serious?
What, are you kidding?
I could've caught anything.
You see that guy?
Sir, I'm gonna have
to ask you to wait
while we tend to our more
critical patients first.
I got his blood
in my mouth!
We have been operating
on a skeleton crew
ever since Katrina,
and we're very backed up.
I'm sure you understand.
Now, if each one of you
will fill out these forms
as thoroughly as possible,
we can get started.
Wait. Where's Emily?
I think
she's still outside.
Do you want me
to go get her?
I'll go.
Hey.
You okay?
It looks like
it's gonna rain.
Em, he's in good hands.
What if he dies?
He's not gonna die.
Oh, my God, what if--
what if he has kids
waiting for him to come home?
Shh. Stop.
They're gonna take
good care of him inside.
Baby, it wasn't
your fault.
It was an accident.
Sorry. Um...
I'll be fine.
Don't apologize.
Everything's
gonna be all right,
and we're gonna get
through this together.
Listen to me.
I could be infected
with God knows what.
Okay? Now, what
does this guy have?
Heart disease.
You can't catch it.
Sit.
Come on.
Let's go inside.
In a minute.
I just...
I just need
to prepare myself
for the smell.
The smell?
They all smell
the same, hospitals.
I hate that smell.
I know.
But you still have to go
inside and get checked out.
We'll be back on the road
in a few hours,
and before you know it,
this will all be over.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Bobby, you're bleeding.
It's nothing.
It's just a scrape.
I'll be all right.
Yes.
Marian.
Oh, Dr. Benway.
Oh, how unfortunate.
Oh, yes. I understand.
Quickly.
I'll take care of it
right away.
Thank you.
Good news, young man.
An exam room
just opened up.
Finally. Thank you.
Excuse me, Nurse.
My boyfriend's bleeding.
Have a seat.
No, but he's bleeding.
It's nothing.
Fine. I'll take
a look at it.
You okay?
Yeah.
She's right.
We gotta take care
of that.
Is that glass?
Doesn't even hurt.
Adrenaline will do that.
Oh, it's just
a little sliver.
Yeah, shit, Bobby. That
doesn't look too good.
Baby!
Oh, my God.
No.
Don't touch that!
No. Fuck, dude.
Dude.
Oh, ew.
Oh, Jesus, Bobby. You okay?
Bobby, stop pulling.
You all right?
You okay?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Bobby!
Bobby!
Travis, patient transport now!
Bobby?
Hey, somebody get--
get a fucking
doctor here!
Stay back.
Bobby!
Get over here!
Travis! Hurry up!
Hurry up!
I want you to take him
to operating room number 2.
Baby.
Bobby?
Baby?
No!
Miss?
I'm sorry, sugar.
This is hospital policy.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I want to go with him.
It's gonna be okay.
I wanna go with him.
I think that's it.
All right.
My boyfriend--
is-- is there any news?
Not yet.
I don't see
any contact info
for either you or Bobby.
Bobby's parents
are in Europe.
I don't know where they're staying.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Of course.
Right away.
Dr. Benway would like
to talk to you in person.
What is it?
Oh, not to worry.
Third floor, fourth
door on your left.
Is he gonna
be okay?
Elevators are
right through that door.
Third floor.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
This you're gonna
laugh about in a few days.
Thanks.
You know...
you're actually
very beautiful
when you're
not terrified.
Don't leave me here.
Don't leave me here.
God, that's killing me.
Nurse?
It's gonna be okay.
I'm with you.
Fuck it.
I gotta go
take a leak.
Yeah, okay.
Aw, this is a fuckin' joke.
Emily Hosfield?
Yes.
I'm Dr. Benway.
Bobby's
gonna be fine.
The glass didn't pierce
his lung after all.
Oh, thank God.
I do have
a few questions.
Sure.
Where is he?
Who?
Your friend.
I need all my little ducks
here for triage.
I think he went
to the bathroom.
Do you happen to know
if Bobby has any
immunosuppressive disorders
such as lupus, Graves',
uh, vasculitis?
Has he ever mentioned
anything like that?
No. But what does that have
to do with his injury?
Well, it's a complicated
medical issue.
I don't really have time to
go over every little detail.
I did go
to medical school.
Wonderful.
When did you graduate?
I didn't.
I dropped out
after my first year.
That's a shame.
Well, I'm sure you'll be
going back to school soon.
No, I don't think so.
Well, I wouldn't be
too sure, Emily.
As my wife
always tells me,
I didn't choose medicine,
medicine chose me.
Now, if you go
to the lobby...
Wait. Can I see
Bobby first?
No. The nurse
will contact you
if I have any more
questions.
Please. I'd really
like to see him.
The nurse
will contact you
if I have
any more questions.
It's Scott.
I found him.
You know, Dr. Benway
really hates it
when people wander off
in his hospital.
We can go with
medicinal purposes, right?
You know, running
security in this place
is a full-time job.
Think I don't have better things
to do than locate burn-outs
in bathrooms?
Burn-outs.
Got it.
Well, let me, uh,
just get rid of this.
Yeah, I suggest you do that
immediately because...
...I can get you
something a lot better.
Do you know where the
patient recovery room is?
That sounds nice.
Are you okay?
Do-- Do you want me
to get a nurse
or a doctor,
someone to help you?
What makes you think
they're here to help?
You want one of my sisters, too?
And I have six of them.
Wow.
Yes, and I'm the baby,
so everyone
spoiled me rotten.
Yes?
Room 3. Right away.
Excuse me.
Dmitri Osipov,
they're ready for you.
Room 3, third floor.
I'll wait for her
girlfriend to come back
so she's not alone.
I'm sorry.
You have to go right away.
We run a very tight
ship here, I'm afraid.
It's okay, Dmitri.
I'll be fine.
It's nothing, right?
Sure.
I'll see you later.
Well, look at what
we got here.
The promised land.
Mmm.
Go ahead
and pick your poison.
There's this new synthetic
morphine derivative
that's the shit, bro.
It's primo.
What would you like?
What do you have?
Hello?
Is that nitrous?
Yeah, my college roommate
was into this.
Not in here, bro.
That shit
is flammable.
Okay. Relax.
I wasn't gonna
turn it on.
Okay.
Okay. All right.
How about a couple
of barbiturates?
Strong enough to stop
a fucking rhino?
You got
any antibiotics?
I just brought you
to chemical Disneyland,
and you want
a fucking antibiotic?
This guy bled in my mouth.
That's fucked up.
Did you ask him to?
Look, I gotta split.
Um, go ahead,
and, uh--
You go ahead
and pick your poison.
Thank you.
What's this?
Whoa, whoa.
Nope. You don't want
to mess with these babies.
These haven't
even been submitted
to the FDA
for approval yet.
Is that so?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Doc used to work
for Zidexx Pharmaceuticals.
He gets us
all the good shit, man.
You tried those?
Sure, yeah. It's good.
Take care.
Amen.
Follow me.
Doctor?
This is bullshit.
Bobby?
Emil--
Bobby.
Bobby?
Bobby.
Emily.
Ooh! Oh, sorry.
What are you
doing here?
I have been looking
all over for you!
Dr. Benway told me
he gave you
specific instructions.
I'm just trying
to find my boyfriend.
I want to be there when--
You have to stop worrying
about your boyfriend
and start worrying
about yourself.
Really--
You need to be checked out as well.
I'm fine.
Now, you have been
in an accident,
young lady,
and whether you
like it or not,
once you come
through our doors,
it is our medical
and legal responsibility
to assess
your condition.
I'm seriously fine.
Now, please
take a seat,
and Dr. Benway will be
with you shortly.
Oh, don't worry, son.
Oh. I, um, set up
a nice lounge in here.
You know, couches,
plasma screen TV.
It's where
I like to chill
when I've sampled
the merchandise.
Yeah, all right.
Yeah.
Mi casa es su casa, bro.
Check it out.
What-- Are you
kidding me? Hey!
Hey, come on, man!
This ain't funny!
Hey, come on, man!
I just dropped
this fuckin' thing!
Don't leave me! Please!
It's Scott.
Listen.
Motherfucker!
Open the fuckin' door!
Open the fuckin'-- I swear to God!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Yeah. I got him.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Uhh.
Doctor.
Am I going to be okay?
I don't think so.
Get the fuck outta here.
Hello?
Help me.
Hello?
Wh-Who is this?
Do you need a nurse?
Do you need help?
No.
Uhh!
Impressed?
I'm not nearly
as vain as it looks.
All these awards
and compensation
are really a means
to an end.
This hard work has allowed
me to move down here
and open this clinic for people
who really need the help.
How's Bobby doing?
I had to remove one last glass
fragment from his left pectoral.
Yeah?
He's fine.
Have a seat.
I understand you hit your
head in the accident?
Oh, it's nothing serious.
Well, I'll be
the judge of that.
Uh-huh.
Gonna look
in your eyes.
Okay.
Tilt your head
back, please.
Can you open
your mouth?
Say "Ahh."
Ahh.
Looks fine.
So, why did you leave
medical school?
I was hardly
ever there.
I think I got about as far
as, "First, do no harm."
Bet your parents wanted
you to be a doctor.
Um, actually, my dad
died about a month ago
from bone cancer.
So...
Yeah.
Family illness
can be
one of the great
life-altering experiences.
Yep.
No doubt about it.
I'm sorry.
That's all
the more reason
for you to go back to medical
school, though, isn't it?
No. I don't think so.
Breathe deeply.
Okay.
I know what it's like,
you know...
to have a loved one
suffering.
My wife became ill
last year.
Her doctors diagnosed her
with terminal cancer.
Traditional medicine
didn't work.
I'm sorry.
Did she...
No, no. Now with
an experimental treatment,
she's actually making
an amazing recovery.
Miraculous, really.
That's great.
We're going to Italy
in a month.
Really?
Yes. I...
I couldn't imagine what would
happen if I had lost her.
Yeah. Ooh.
Take off your shirt,
please.
Um...
Yeah.
Keep your face
towards the door,
your back to me.
Bring your knees
to your chest.
The fetal position.
Okay.
Is that good?
Yes. It's fine.
Thank you.
What are we doing?
A lumbar puncture.
We need to check your
spinal fluid for blood,
see if you had an aneurysm
with that head trauma.
Shouldn't I just be
having a CT scan?
No, no, no.
A CT scan isn't necessary.
But you see?
You can't shake
the instincts of a doctor.
You really do have it
in your blood.
No pun intended.
Now, this is gonna
pinch a little bit.
Uh-huh.
Ohh!
Ohh!
Don't move.
You don't want this needle
ripping through
your spinal cord, do you?
That...
Ohh...
That fucking hurts.
Oh, my God.
There's no need for such
coarse language, young lady.
Ohh...
Perfect.
You can get dressed now.
So, have you talked
to Bobby's parents?
Ohh...
They really should know
what's going on.
I talked to them a half an
hour ago, as a matter of fact.
They're very excited about Bobby
getting home to see them.
Oh, man.
Oh, man,
I'm tired.
Hey, Travis?
The doc wants
to examine her.
Shit, man, I'm just
gettin' started.
Goddamn it.
You know, they don't
pay me enough for this shit.
Oh, come on, man.
It pays hell of a lot more than
making license plates up in Angola.
Remember that?
You want to do that again?
We got a good deal here.
When do you think
we're moving shop?
In a month?
No, it's gonna
be sooner.
The doc went all out
on this latest procedure, man.
His wife is actually...
doing better,
if you can
believe that.
Hmm. Jesus.
Maybe he's not
as crazy as he seems.
Yeah, well, let's not
go too far, all right?
What are we gonna do with all
these patients when we move?
Let's just
leave 'em here.
Where are they gonna
go on their own?
None of 'em can even count
to 6 or even feed themself,
or wipe their ass,
so fuck 'em.
We could bulldoze
a big pit,
shove 'em in,
throw gasoline on 'em,
and then
watch 'em burn.
Or we could--
I gotta go.
Get her up
to the exam room now.
Okay?
Well, wait a minute.
If you're so worried
about it, you take her up.
I got fingerprints that
I've gotta get rid of.
What's wrong with you?
Why are you being
such a little bitch?
Fuck you.
Okay, look, just get
her up to an exam room
before the doc
notices, please?
Yeah. Yeah.
Uhh.
Jude.
Jude.
What did you do?
What...
There's something under there
and I just can't find it.
Jude, stop it.
What did they do to you?
What happened?
He gave me a pill
and, uh...
Okay, Jude, stop it.
You're hallucinating, okay?
We're going to find
everyone else,
and we're going to get
out of here, okay?
Do you know
where anyone else is?
I saw it.
I saw it.
Whoever said there
wasn't life after death?
Jude, take it easy, okay?
Come on.
Come on.
Is everything
in order, Doctor?
So far.
Good.
And I am fine
on this end.
Steady heart rate.
Good healthy beat to it.
By the way, Doctor,
I've just checked on the boy.
I don't think
he'll last 12 hours.
He has to.
Lisette is doing
much better.
The organs haven't
been rejected.
Tilt your head back,
please.
Reflex hammer.
Thank you.
This won't hurt a bit.
This might hurt a little.
Marian.
Yes, Dr. Benway?
I'm right here.
What did Travis
do to her?
Uh, he got carried away.
I'll deal with him.
Your job is to prevent
these situations.
I'm on the ground floor
of a major
medical breakthrough.
We've lost
our first host.
Now she's useless, too.
I don't have time for this.
No, of course not.
It won't happen again.
And we still have
the other two.
Do your job, Marian.
Have Travis dispose of her.
Pathetic.
That's what we get
for hiring ex-cons.
Dr. Benway?
I have everything
under control, sir.
You don't have to worry.
Clare. Clare.
Oh, no. Oh, Jesus.
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit.
Help me get her up.
Help me--
Clare.
Clare, baby. No.
I'm done.
I can't take this.
We're getting out of here.
Not until we find Bobby.
Hey, don't you get it?
Bobby's dead.
No, he's alive,
and we're going to find him.
Emily, listen to me.
Emily, you don't want
to end up like Clare.
Huh?
Your skull cracked open,
split up the middle--
Is that what you want?
I'm gonna find Bobby.
That's what I want, okay?
You've heard them.
He doesn't have much longer.
I'm going to find him.
Then you go find him.
What?
I can't fucking
handle this.
Jude...
What everyone says
about me is true.
You're on your own.
Jude. Jude.
Jude!
Hmm.
I need help.
Please.
Please.
Hello? Hello?
Someone is killing
my friend.
I-I need you to send
help out right away.
I'm at Mercy Hospital.
Ma'am, Mercy's been closed
for three years.
We'll harvest
her nerve tissue first.
Nerve tissue,
of course.
What?
Marian!
Oh! No!
This is the second patient
to escape in two days.
I'm sorry, David.
So sorry.
If she gets out of here, she'll
jeopardize everything I've worked for.
Do you understand me?
I-I do.
I know.
Find her.
Yes. You can count
on me, David.
You can--
You can count on me.
You can count
on me, David.
You can--
You can count on me.
Hello?
No, it's Travis.
What?
I don't know
where the hell he is.
I just found his phone
ringing on the floor.
All right.
You can stop panicking.
She's right here.
Aaah!
Fucking cunt!
Come back!
You listen to me.
Try any bullshit,
I will rip
your fucking head off.
You understand me?
Oh, good evening,
Officer.
Evening.
How can I help you?
Yeah, I'm following up
on a 911 call we just received.
This facility
is listed as closed.
Oh, our funding
only came through recently.
We're in the midst
of reopening.
What happened
to your knee?
Oh, that?
Uh, that's not my blood.
That was me.
I'm the one who called.
Stand back, ma'am.
Stand back.
Sarah, that was you?
You called them?
What were you thinking?
You did that?
Sarah's a patient
up in Psychiatric.
I'm not a patient.
No, they're murdering people.
My boyfriend, he's missing,
and I don't know where he is.
Slow down.
Officer, I am so sorry
about this.
Sarah, sweetie--
Don't--
My name's not Sarah.
I'm Emily.
Let me see some ID.
Okay.
Oh, shit.
Hold on.
One second.
Um...shit.
Shit.
We were-- We were
in a car accident.
I must have lost it there.
Really, I'm not crazy.
You have to believe me.
I can show you--
I can show you
where Clare's body is.
I'm not crazy.
Okay, Sarah.
Let's go, come on.
Hang on, hang on,
hang on.
Let me check out her claim.
It's strictly procedure.
What did you
want me to see?
Here, this way.
I can show you
where Clare's body is.
Go ahead.
I keep trying
to place you.
Have we met before?
I've-- I've worked in a lot
of hospitals around here.
No, that's not it.
It's somewhere else.
Maybe it was when--
Here we are.
She's here laying on...
They-- They moved her.
She was--
She was laying right here.
I-- I don't know
where they put her.
I don't know, but she
was laying right here.
Again, Officer, um,
sorry you had to come
all the way out here
for nothing.
I apologize.
Listen to me, okay?
I was with her.
She was laying right there.
I swear.
I promise you, okay?
She had no back
of her fucking head.
There was no--
nothing there.
I can-- I-I can--
Listen.
I can take you to a room
where there's body parts.
I can show you everything.
And we have to find
my boyfriend.
I don't know where--
Ma'am--
T-55.
Yeah, this is Jacobs.
I'm leaving
the hospital now.
You can go ahead and chalk
this up as a prank call.
No, I'm telling the truth.
No.
Thank you for your cooperation, sir.
No problem.
Wait.
We'll make sure a patient
doesn't call you guys again.
No, wait--
I'm sorry for--
You can't go.
All right?
They're going
to kill me. Please.
It's okay, Sarah.
No, you have to believe me.
Let's get you
back upstairs.
How have you let things
get this far out of control?
This situation
is still manageable.
I'll get the patrol car
out of sight,
and I'll take care
of the body.
She called 911.
She brought this on.
No.
Sir, if we start packing now,
we can be out of here by dawn.
Lisette's not ready.
We're not going anywhere.
Get her down to O.R.
Have Marian prep her
for surgery.
Yes, sir.
Move.
No. Please. No.
Please.
No.
No!
No!
Aah!
Now, now, relax.
It's not like
this is brain surgery.
No--
What kind of ridiculous
equipment is this?
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Everything's made
overseas these days.
Aah!
It always gets harder
when it hits the bone.
Shut off the music!
This isn't working.
Find me an electric drill.
Right away, Doctor.
Right away.
I have to go talk
to Lisette.
Watch her
until I get back.
No. No.
Uh-oh, someone's
got a boo-boo.
Get the fuck
away from me!
You can't do this.
The doctor's gonna--
You think I give a shit
what the doc says?
He's out of his fucking mind,
in case you haven't noticed.
The way things
are going tonight,
it's going to get
a lot worse.
No, don't. No.
No, no, don't.
Please, don't.
Aah!
God! Fuck!
Fucking cunt!
Aah!
You sick fuck!
You sick piece of shit!
You suck fuck!
Sick fuck!
Uh, miss?
Ma'am?
Excuse me, miss, uh...
...if there's any way
you can help me
get out
of this hospital, um...
You see, I'm, uh...
I'm, uh-- I'm trying to--
trying to find an exit.
So, uh...
I have to go back
to work now, darling.
I know I made promises
to you before,
but this time,
we're close.
Soon we'll be back in Rome,
strolling through
the Piazza Navona,
the Villa Borghese.
Rest.
I'll come visit you soon.
What do you want me
to do with her?
Hook her up.
No.
First, we do no harm, Emily.
Then after that,
things get a little blurry.
Jude!
No!
Oh, shit.
I got it.
Okay.
Okay, I'm going
to hold them back.
I need you to run
as fast as you can.
Promise me.
No, no.
Listen to me.
I'm right
behind you, okay?
Jude, I'm not going
without you.
I need you to do this.
Run. I have to.
Jude!
Jude, open the fucking door.
Jude!
Jude,
what are you doing?
Come on.
Open the door. Jude.
No, open--
Just open the door.
Jude!
Please!
Jude, you don't
have to do this!
Please.
Get the fuck
out of here, Emily!
Run, now!
Not without you.
Don't do this.
Come on.
Come on.
Bobby.
Emily?
I'm here.
I'm here, okay?
I'm going to get you
out of here, I promise.
There's something wrong.
I can't really see.
Please, I want
to get out of here.
I want to get
out of here.
I know.
I know you do.
Oh, baby.
Help me.
It's all going
to be okay, I promise.
I promise.
Just close
your eyes, okay?
Close your eyes.
Yeah.
Think of something nice.
New York, last summer.
You remember?
Do you remember our walk
along the East River?
Where you told me...
I told you...
...I loved you.
Yeah.
That was the first time
you ever said it to me.
And it only took me
two years.
Are you thinking
of that now?
Yeah.
Good.
Baby?
Yeah?
Are you going to get me
out of here?
Yes, baby.
Just keep thinking
about the river...
...about us, okay?
Just keep thinking.
Just keep thinking.
Yah!
I have to do every fucking
little thing myself!
Aah!
Oh! You got me dirty!
Bleed out, bitch.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
This was all
because of you...
wasn't it?
Help me.
You're the reason
everybody's dead.
Help me.
It was all because of you.
No!
You're next.
Aah!
Aah!
No.
No.
No, don't--
Uh, no!
No, don't--
Aah!
Die!
Aah!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
You were right.
I always was meant
to be a doctor.
Not to do
what I have done
In the House
of the Rising Sun
I've got one foot
on the platform
And one foot
on the train
To wear that
ball and chain
They call
the Rising Sun
The ruin
of many a poor boy
And, God,
I know I'm one
