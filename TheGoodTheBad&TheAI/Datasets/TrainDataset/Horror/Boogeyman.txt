GIRL'S VOICE :
Don't go to sleep. He's waiting for you.
Hey! What's going on?
Oh, man.
Well?
He's here.
Who's here?
BOY: He came out
of the closet.
Tim, nobody's here.
What are you talking about?
Oh.
Him.
Okay.
Tim...
It's just a story. Okay?
He's not real.
Well, let's have a look around
then, shall we?
No.
Nah, nothing back here.
Oh.
Okay.
Hello!
Nope.
Nobody home.
Just us.
No!
This is gonna get ugly.
No more vodka.
Hey, Tim. Let me have
one of those green things.
Whoa! Careful.
Oops.
No more for Fran.
Hey! It's my party.
Tim, you still on
for this weekend?
No, I thought I could see
if I could wrangle up
a dinner invitation from one
of those art-department girls.
Like this one right here.
Here you go.
Oh, hey. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, Scotty,
did Tim tell you
about meeting my parents
tomorrow?
Meeting the folks?
Sounds serious.
Yeah, if he can survive the
weekend with Jessica's father.
Oh, come on.
Dad's not that bad.
Don't listen
to that.
Except for the time
he tried to drown you.
Oh, you shouldn't
have told her.
No, I was 7.
He was teaching me how to swim.
By throwing you
in the middle of a lake?
You know, this might be
a good time for a toast.
Yeah?
Yeah. I'd say.
Excuse me,
everyone.
When we come back
from Thanksgiving on Monday,
things will be
a lot different.
For starters,
it'll be a lot quieter.
But it definitely won't be
as much fun.
The Daily News
is lucky to get you.
ALL:
Cheers.
Okay, break it up.
Be good, Jess.
I will.
I'm gonna miss you.
All of you.
I'm gonna miss you too.
So I told my parents
I'd be there by 11.
All right,
I'll get your coat.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey, Jess.
Hey.
You're not getting weird
on me again, are you?
No, no.
I just spaced out for a second.
Okay.
JESSICA:
Where's your car?
TIM:
It wouldn't start.
Is it gonna
make it tomorrow?
I got a guy
looking at it.
Tim, if you think you can use
the "car broke down" excuse,
you are mistaken, cowboy.
I'll be there,
I promise.
Okay.
So you want
a ride home?
No, I'm good.
I'll cut through the park.
Besides,
I've seen your driving.
Uh-huh. Yeah, okay.
Be careful.
I'll be fine.
See you tomorrow.
WOMAN: I don't-- Who would
have done this?
Who would've taken...?
Who would--?
Who would take him?
WOMAN: Why would they do this?
Where is he?
Listen, I know
you're having Thanksgiving
with your girlfriend
and all,
but it'd be really nice
if you could make it out
to see your mom
this weekend.
She's not doing so well,
and, you know, it'd be--
It'd good for her
to see you.
And, hey, I got some stuff for
you to sign too. House stuff.
All right, hope I see you
this weekend.
Hey, you made it.
Hey.
Hey.
Were the directions okay?
Perfect. Here.
Come on.
Wait, wait.
Shouldn't we wait for
the bellhop or something?
Shut up.
It's their house, not mine.
What's with the tie?
I don't know.
I figured meeting the family.
Why not, right?
Come on.
Let's put your stuff
in the guest room.
JESSICA'S DAD: So Jessica tells us
you two met at the magazine.
SISTER: Are you in
the art department?
I'm an
associate editor.
MOTHER:
That sounds impressive.
It's just a glorified
fact-checker.
Tim's very good
at his job.
FATHER:
How about family?
Got any family nearby?
Any brothers, sisters?
No, sir.
No brothers or sisters, just me.
How about your folks?
GRANDMA: Let the boy eat.
We're just talking, Mother.
JESSICA: Dad.
The family thing's
kind of complicated, sir.
This stuffing is delicious,
Chelsea.
Tim's had kind of a strained
relationship with his parents.
Tim's father ran out
when he was 8.
Jess.
Oh, that's sad.
Then he had to go live
with his uncle,
in a tiny room
in the back of his bar.
Well, what about your mother?
She sort of had a tough time
after my dad left.
It was pretty hard
on both of us.
Is there anything else
you wanted to know, Dad?
JESSICA:
Be down in a minute, Mom.
You have fun down there?
Oh, come on. They could use
a little shaking up.
Did you see my
sister's face when I said
you lived in a tiny room
in the back of you uncle's bar?
It wasn't in the back
of a bar, you know.
I know.
I just like messing with them.
Is that why you wanted me here,
to freak out your family?
No.
No.
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?
Tell you what.
I gotta go down,
say goodnight,
but I'll sneak in later
and make it up to you.
Okay?
In that case,
I'll put on
something naughty.
Well, you do that.
TIM: I like this
sneaking-around thing.
It's kind of dirty.
You all right?
Timmy.
You can't keep running away.
Look at me.
Mom?
Why, what's the matter with you?
Look at me!
Look at me.
Look at me.
You're a bad, little boy.
Tim?
Baby, what are you doing
on the floor?
Tim, what is it?
Jessica.
Oh, God, I had
the most messed-up dream.
What was it?
I gotta go see my mom.
Wait.
There's something wrong.
You what?
I know it.
Tim. Tim, no. Hey.
Listen,
let's get back in bed, and--
Where's my phone?
Tim, what is wrong with you?
God.
Where's my phone?
Shh. Just leave it.
Hello?
Hey, Uncle Mike,
I got your message.
Hey.
Is everything okay?
I'm gonna see Mom tomorrow.
I thought you were here
for the weekend.
What?
Tim.
Okay.
Okay.
Tim.
I have to go.
You-- Tim, what is it?
Look, I just have to go.
So the funeral's today.
Yeah, this afternoon.
I'm so sorry, Tim.
Me too.
Wow.
That's fantastic.
That's really strong.
What's that you've got,
Peter?
Oh, that rainbow
is beautiful.
How many colors
in there?
I'm thinking of going by
the old house.
Really?
My uncle's been
fixing the place up
to sell since Mom went
to the hospital last year.
I felt like I should be the one
to go through her things.
I-I should've
done more, but,
I mean, it's something,
right?
Listen to me, Tim. Something
happened in that house,
but it wasn't supernatural.
There's nothing in there
but memories.
You dealt
with your father's leaving
the best way that you could.
But you were 8.
Tim, you've been coming here
for what, 15 years?
Look around you.
There's only children here.
WOMAN :
Dr. Matheson to Observation.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
Go home, Tim.
Spend one night
in that house.
It will help.
It's okay. It's okay.
Hey, we need some
help in here!
Hey, the nurse is on the way.
It's okay, it's all right.
What? What is it?
NURSE: Just relax now.
It's gonna be all right.
It's all right.
It's gonna be
all right.
PRIEST: And in Paul's letter
to the Corinthians, he says:
"We shall not all fall asleep,
"but we will all be changed
in an instant,
in the blink of an eye."
"When my tongue rejoices,
my body will rest in peace,
"because you will not abandon me
to the grave.
"For you, O Lord,
have delivered my soul to death,
"my eyes from tears,
my feet from stumbling.
"Thou knowest the secrets...
PRIEST:
"...spare us.
"Suffer us not
in our last hour.
"Dust thou art,
and unto dust
thou shalt return."
Thanks for
doing all this.
She was
my sister.
When are you
heading back?
Actually, I might stay
in town tonight.
In the house.
UNCLE MIKE: I thought you didn't
like that house.
TIM: Yeah, well...
Tim, the place is a mess.
I've been doing a whole
lot of work there, and--
And I got
some people coming.
I won't mess
anything up.
Is that Katie?
Yeah.
How long
has it been?
A long time.
Well, you should go and say hi.
No, I don't think so.
All right.
Suit yourself.
Hey, come here.
Oh.
Here you go.
You might need these.
Thanks for everything.
It's good seeing you again,
Tim.
MOTHER: Timmy.
and you're
supposed to feed her.
FATHER: Come on, Timmy,
just turn the light on.
He's scared
of his damn closet.
MOTHER: You know why he's so scared,
don't you?
FATHER:
Why?
Because you freaked
him out so bad
with that stupid
story of yours.
You've gotta be kidding. It was a story.
No, no.
My dad did
the same thing to me.
And look how perfect
you turned out.
It was nothing,
okay?
He's got a very vivid
imagination.
Aw, jeez, Mary, this is
ridiculous. I was just trying--
You're gonna put that boy in
therapy the rest of his life.
Just calm down, okay.
Timmy!
KATE:
Cody. Cody!
Kate!
Kate!
Cody!
Are you all right?
Yeah.
I think I just hit my head.
He's never
done that before.
Do you wanna come in,
put some ice on that?
Sure.
I saw you at the funeral.
I wasn't sure
you'd remember me.
I'm real sorry
about your mom.
Yeah, me too.
How about that ice?
Yeah.
Ow!
Jeez.
Sorry.
What're you trying to do?
I'm sorry.
I'm in pain.
So...
So...
So how's the city?
It's all right.
It's been a little crazy lately,
but...
You got a girlfriend?
Uh...
Actually, yeah. Yeah, I do.
How about you?
Do I have a girlfriend?
No.
No, I don't.
You know what I mean.
No, I don't have a boyfriend.
Just me and my dad.
I'm sure some shrink could have
a field day with that.
So, um, how long
are you staying around?
I think just tonight.
I wanted to go
through my mom's things,
you know,
pictures and stuff.
I found a goofy one
of you and me.
Goofy?
I don't remember
ever being goofy.
I'll show you.
It's actually kind of cute.
No, I don't think--
Cute. Cute, I believe.
KATE: Goofy, that's...
That's crazy talk.
I mean, if you said you saw
a picture that--
You know, that was stunning
or, you know, gorgeous,
okay, you know,
I've heard that
a thousand times.
YOUNG TIM: He took Dad,
and now he's gonna take me.
MOTHER:
Timmy, nobody took your dad.
KATE:
You find it?
What?
Goofy photo?
Oh, uh...
Here.
Aww.
Look at us.
Even you're adorable.
Thanks.
You know, I was crushed
when you left.
It broke my little heart.
And it broke my heart
you couldn't throw a baseball.
You were the one
that was scared of closets.
I told you that?
Yeah.
I told you closets were nothing.
It's the thing under the bed
you had to be worried about.
All right, I have to go home
and start Dad's dinner.
I bet you don't have any food
in the house, do you?
Let me come back later
and bring you some.
You don't have to do that.
I know. It's frightening how
domestic I've become, though.
Bye.
Hello.
Hello.
Hey.
You all right?
Wanna come out?
What were you doing in there?
You were at my mother's
funeral, weren't you?
My dad knew her.
What's your name?
Franny.
So, Franny, wanna tell why
you're following me around?
I wanted to talk to you.
I wanted to ask you something.
All right.
Wanna ask me now?
Is it true?
Is what true?
The Boogeyman took your dad.
Look, I don't know
where you heard that,
but it's just a story.
There's no such thing
as the Boogeyman.
I was trying to
make sense of things.
My dad left.
I was upset.
That's all that happened.
Okay?
It's late. Your parents
are probably worried.
Where do you live?
I'll give you a ride home.
Next to the park.
It's all right.
I've got my own ride.
Hey, Franny.
Count to five.
When you're afraid,
close your eyes
and count to five.
Sometimes it works for me.
What happens
when you get to six?
FATHER: You gotta be brave.
Come on, Tim.
YOUNG TIM:
No, Dad!
Dad! Let me out!
Tim, stop it. Okay? There is
nothing in there. Just trust me.
Trust me.
There is nothing in there.
"Just count to five
like I told you."
Count to five,
like I told you, okay?
He's here. He's here.
One.
Two.
Two.
YOUNG TIM:
Three.
Good boy.
Four. Five.
He's here. He's here.
He's here. He's here.
Oh, Tim.
Where are you going?
We have to go.
What happened to your face?
Please. Now. We have to go.
I called your uncle. I'm so--
I want to go now.
Look, I'm sorry for
losing it back there.
I just needed to
get out of that house.
Hey, it's okay.
It's-- It's really late.
Maybe we should stop somewhere
and get some rest, you know?
How you doing?
Tim, come on.
I drove two and a half hours
to be with you.
I can't do this anymore,
okay?
It's too much,
and I'm too tired.
Look, can't we just forget
all about the bad stuff
just for one night?
Just try to have some fun?
Pretend that nothing else
is out there.
Listen, why don't you
go grab some ice?
I'll get the bath ready.
We can raid the minibar
and have our own little
"forget about the world" party.
Okay?
All right.
Good.
Good.
Hey, Tim.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Tim.
Hello?
Brought you some food.
I'm coming up.
Are you decent?
Nice lighting.
Tim. Hello?
I'll make us a vodka Red Bull.
Tim?
I might have made these
a little strong.
Listen, Jess.
I just want to thank you
for putting up with me.
Jessica?
Jessica?
Jessica?
Jessica?
Jessica?
Come on, Tim.
This isn't funny.
KATE :
Oh, my God.
How long were you
waiting in there?
Oh! You scared
the crap out of me.
Come on, I made you
some food. Come on.
How did I--?
Where's Jessica?
Who's Jessica?
We went to the hotel.
The-- The motel. And then--
What are you talking about?
I have to go.
Tim. Tim!
What the hell is going on?
Come with me.
I need you to see
what I see.
KATE: What's wrong?
Where are we going?
I don't know.
I don't know anything.
I don't know where I've been.
I don't know what I've done.
I just don't know.
TIM:
Oh, God.
What?
That's it.
That's the motel.
What are we
doing here?
Maybe you should go
to the front desk and ask if--
Jessica?
I was here.
What happened, Tim?
We were here.
I don't know.
I went to get ice,
and I came back to...
He took her.
What?
Who took her?
You won't believe me.
Where did the blood
come from, Tim?
Well, who do you think
took your friend?
Tim,
if something happened...
If you accidentally
did something--
I didn't hurt Jessica.
Are you sure?
Everybody told me
I was making it up.
For 15 years.
Ever since my dad left,
telling me over and over.
But I was right.
I don't want to be,
but I am.
Tim.
Tim.
Goodnight, Tim.
Kate! Kate,
please open the door!
Kate! Kate.
Go home.
Come out!
Get off the porch.
Tim, listen to me.
No, you need to get out of here.
Don't grab me!
He's in your house.
My dad is in my house.
He's upstairs, probably
waiting up for me.
Tim...
I think maybe you're sick.
And I wish I could
help you, but I can't.
Now, if you don't go home,
I'm calling the police.
It wasn't your dad.
I saw him.
I'm going inside now.
Go home.
You need help, Tim.
Couldn't sleep either?
I was looking for you.
You said
you lived by the park.
Sometimes when I think
of my house, I come out here.
Sometimes all night,
until the sun comes up.
And everything's okay again.
What if your parents come
to check in on you?
I won't be there.
I told you a lie.
The story about the night
my father disappeared.
I know.
He took my dad.
Tonight he took
a friend of mine.
He's gonna
keep taking people.
Everyone who means
something to me.
I need your help.
Why?
Because we're the only ones
who believe.
I have to go home.
Hello?
KATE:
It's Kate Houghton.
Listen, I was just with Tim,
and, uh...
I'm-- I'm worried about him.
He's acting kind of--
Could you go over there
and just, uh...
Just check in on him?
I'm sorry if I woke you up.
Dad?
Is that you?
Franny!
Franny.
I opened your pack.
I saw your pictures
and the articles.
I just need
to ask you something.
Okay.
How do you stop him?
I'm not sure.
I know that house.
I've been here before.
Come on.
I used to come talk to the man
who lived here.
Everyone said
he was crazy.
He said his daughter was taken.
What are all these words?
TIM:
I'm not sure.
He sealed up everything.
All the closets
and doors.
He was trying to understand it.
Trying to give it a name.
He sat here.
Waiting.
I don't want to be here.
He didn't seal this one.
This was the door.
He was trying to bring him out.
Franny.
We have to go back to the house.
My dad was
trying to find me.
Trying to beat it.
You have to go home.
You have to go to the place
where it first started.
That's where you face him.
My dad got too scared.
He couldn't face him.
I want to help you.
You can't.
You can only help yourself.
Tim!
Hey, Tim!
You okay, buddy?
Kate called.
Said things are getting
a little loose around here.
Uncle Mike?
Uncle Mike?
Uncle Mike!
Hey, Mike!
He took him.
He's waiting for you.
JESSICA: Tim, what are you doing?
Get in here.
Jessica?
Jessica!
Jessica?
Tim?
Mike.
Uncle Mike, it's me.
What are you doing?
Mike, Mike, I'm here.
Can you hear me?
All right, all right, he's gone.
I'm gonna save you.
Come on!
All right, hold on.
I'm gonna cut you out, okay?
I'm not gonna hurt you.
KATE:
--check in on him?
Thanks.
I'm sorry
if I woke you up.
Dad?
Is that you?
What the hell was that?
I have to stop this.
I have to go after him.
He's leading me somewhere.
If I'm not around,
he won't bother you, okay?
Tim.
I don't understand.
Tim!
Help! Come on, come on!
Help! Get him off! No!
I've got get you
out of here.
Kate, come on!
What? What?
Come on, go, go!
KATE:
What happened? Come on!
We gotta
get out of here!
Come on!
Come on, help me!
Come on, Tim!
Oh, God.
FRANNY: You have to go to the place
where it first started.
One.
Two.
Three.
YOUNG TIM: Dad!
Four.
Five.
FRANNY: My dad got too scared.
Six.
KATE:
Tim, is he gone?
Tim?
What are you doing?
Come on!
Tim!
He's gone.
Is it over?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's over.
He's not coming back.
If you fall down
Finding your way back home
She wasn't
On your feet now
You just made your way
Back home
You found your way
Back home
Back again, back again
Forever
Mom?
Mom?
Could you close the closet door?
