- Come on, life sounds. Let's go.
- Okay.
Mike down, mike down.
There you go, now go.
You'd think I'd never
done this. Ready?
Hey, wait a second. Ready.
Five, four, three...
Hi, I'm Angela Vidal.
Come with us tonight
as we travel along with-
- Sorry.
- Okay.
- Ready?
- Yeah, wait a second.
You got a little
hair thing. Hold on.
Let me get that.
That right there.
- Okay, there we go.
- Thank you.
Okay.
Hold on.
Okay. Ready.
Hi, I'm Angela Vidal.
Come with us tonight as we paint
the town red on The Night shift,
Sorry, a little off my A
- game. I'll get there.
That wasn't bad. The second part
just seemed a little pushed, though.
On tonight's Night shift,
we're in Los Angeles...
...traveling along with that special
breed of hero we like to call...
...the fire department.
We should have come earlier.
We could be going with them.
Well, that's cool. You got it?
- Yeah, that's great. That was perfect.
- We'll wait for them to get back.
- You prefer Bob or
Robert-? - Bob's good.
- Bob, okay, sorry. Ready? Okay.
- Yeah.
Three, two, one.
Tell us, Bob, what's a normal
night here at the station?
This might surprise
most people...
...but 85 percent of the
calls we go out on are medical.
It can be anything from chest
pain to more serious things.
How do you handle that with
ambulances and hospitals?
Most ambulances you
see are fire department.
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.
And most firefighters
are also paramedics.
At least, that's the
direction it's going.
One more question, something
I'm sure we're all wondering:
Do firefighters still slide
down those fabulous poles?
We sure do.
No turning back.
Tell my mom I loved her.
- See?
- That's not so bad.
I'm glad I didn't wear a skirt.
That could really hurt your legs.
Tell me, Bob, how do you get
down when you're wearing a skirt?
Pantyhose help.
Pantyhose.
That's what they wear under
their, what, their turnouts.
- Exactly.
- Pantyhose.
- Fire- retardant pantyhose.
- You heard it here.
- Can I do it one more time?
- Sure.
I'll be right back, okay?
- We're going to the dining hall.
- All right.
- Couple of guys I want you to meet.
- Cool.
Hey.
- This is Jake.
- Hey.
- And Fletcher.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
These are the men you'll be
shadowing. Wherever they go, you go.
Cool. Please, oh, please,
finish eating. We'll talk after.
- Well, would you like some?
- Yeah.
- Did you make
it? - We got-
I didn't make it.
Firemen are really good cooks.
- Yeah, that's what I hear.
- Exactly.
- You should try some of the food.
- Yeah, I'm game.
- Please finish eating.
- We'll get you a plate.
Great. Sounds great.
Just maybe un
- tuck your shirt and stick it up here.
- Okay. Okay.
- Clip it on your collar.
- You filming this?
- Yeah.
Elliot's been telling me I never give him enough B
- roll...
...so I'm just
gonna shoot it all.
- Jake? Jake?
- Yeah, yeah.
If you could keep from
rubbing into the mike too much-
- Sorry, yeah.
- Don't worry about the camera.
- Pretend it's not even there.
- Okay.
Can you say something?
Give me a level?
Yeah. Mike check, one-
You can just pretend it's
not there. Just talk free.
Can you say something
more compelling?
I don't know what to say-
I mean, am I gonna have
this thing on all the time?
Yeah, just watch what you
say. We'll hear everything.
Shit.
You're probably not allowed
to swear on your station.
No. We can cut most of it out.
But it helps if you're not dropping F
- bombs.
Point noted. Filed right here.
So if I was to call this guy an ass
- monkey...
...that would be considered
a swear too, right?
It's gonna be a long night.
- So this thing?
- Yeah?
Is this some sort of torture device
when you don't get in your turnouts?
- That's what it is.
- Can you get it?
Yes. This is called
a hook ladder.
We use this in the- The
firemen would use this-
- We should bring it down?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- All right.
Can you grab the hook?
So this was used in
the '20s and the '30s.
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
And as you can see...
...these are the rungs,
and the hook at the end...
...they would grasp onto one
window and then pull themselves up.
And then when they got to that
windowsill, they would hook it again.
- And then pull themselves up.
- Okay.
Did you get the hook,
Scott? You see this?
Used in the '20s and '30s.
They stopped using it around-
- Hold it up higher.
- Replaced it-
- That's good, right?
- Good.
Replaced it with a regular
ladder that extends?
Yeah, and rope.
They must have tiny feet.
Those are little rungs.
Yeah. Firemen were a
lot smaller back then.
The fires were bigger
and they were smaller.
- Don't tell captain we took this down.
- I'm not gonna tell him I touched it.
I wanna introduce you to
somebody. This is Wilshire. Mark.
- Good boy.
- Hey, Wilshire.
- Say hi.
- Dog right out of the cartoons.
Well, there's a reason why the
Dalmatians were in cartoons.
The fire department has a
great sense of tradition.
Yeah, we do.
Dalmatians got along
well with horses.
Important when the fire trucks were horse
- drawn.
Now they're used as mascots.
But what they're trained to do
is run in and stop the traffic.
- Kind of like Fletch.
- Yeah.
That's what I do, I run out there.
Sort of like what a siren does today.
Okay, well, Wilshire can show you
what to do in case you catch on fire.
- Stop, drop and roll.
- Yeah.
So let's just pretend you're
- I'm on fire.
- Wilshire's gonna teach you.
Tell me what to do.
Okay. Wilshire.
Wilshire, mark. Stay.
Wilshire, drop.
Drop. Drop.
Wilshire, roll.
Wilshire, roll.
- Good.
- Look at that.
Good boy. Good boy.
- I'm gonna live.
- Report.
You're not gonna be on fire.
So it's stop, drop and roll, in
case you catch on fire. Wilshire.
- Yeah, you know, have some fun.
- You all hang out a lot?
- Yeah.
- You kind of live together.
Yeah, we definitely live
together. Close quarters.
- Okay, good.
- Oh, ready?
So yeah, we have 48
- hour shifts...
...so we have everything
we need in this place...
...from, you know, a small
gym to this handball court.
I'll show it to you.
- It's nice, right?
- Yeah.
sir, you got a call
on the office line,
Can you pick up a call
on the office line?
Non
- responder.
- Oh, shoot.
- Yeah.
- I was hoping we'd get a call.
- Yeah.
Not a big one, a little
call so we can see action.
- Exciting, I guess.
- Yeah.
Gotta be annoying when
trying to finish a game.
Not if you're losing.
Every time, you know, we
go respond to a call...
...the points reset.
Depending on which side
you're on, it's sort of nice.
Works in your favor
from time to time?
Not in my favor. What
are you talking about?
I never lose.
I think I'd roller
- skate if I had access to this.
I can see you
doing that. Yeah.
Okay, so this is where the men
store their boots and turnouts.
The pole hole is over here.
- The pole hole.
- Yeah, interesting name, I know.
- You got the locker room here.
- Yep.
You got the dorms here.
Our viewers always
like to see action...
...so maybe we should
go into the locker room.
- Let's go in the locker room.
- You got it.
- Right this way.
- I was kidding, I was kidding.
Okay, towel up, guys.
We got a female on deck.
- Female on the deck.
- Oh, my God.
That's Griffin. He
can't sing very well.
He's got one major
talent, so come this way.
- He's got a huge talent.
- We're not using this.
Here. We have different hoses at the
station, and this is the Griffin hose.
- Griffin hose.
- What the hell?
You know, I hope that's a wide
- angle lens.
Oh, my God.
Stay in there.
Hey, put that thing away.
This is adding a whole new
meaning to the term fireman's hose.
- Hey, hit the
floor. - Oh, my-
I understand why there
are no women here.
- Plenty of female firefighters.
- In this station?
No, not currently.
Okay, I think I can
be a firefighter.
- Yeah, it's a lot harder than it seems.
- Keep the door closed.
You know what? Pick
something you're good at.
I bet you $10 I can do it better.
You all can be my witnesses.
- That's too easy. Ten bucks?
- Yeah.
How about my place?
I think we're done here.
We got everything we need.
Here we go. Listen up.
Did you know you were
gonna be on camera?
- Behind the line. Ready?
- Yeah.
- Ten bucks.
- You can't be in the way.
- I know.
- Get on that side.
I'm just saying.
You guys ready?
- You know what you're doing?
- Yes.
And go.
- Get in there.
- That's not nice.
That's not fair. She pushed.
- She pushed.
- Haven't got that much time.
- Yes. You owe her 10 bucks, man.
- Ten dollars.
Pay up. Oh, that's
embarrassing.
- Oh, this is embarrassing.
- That's really embarrassing.
Okay, rolling.
Just waiting on
something to happen.
You wanna go back outside?
See what they're up to?
Why not?
- Careful.
- Thank you.
We're good.
You good?
I think they're
talking about you.
Will you turn up his mike?
You didn't catch no eye.
Here, give me some of that.
I'll tell you, all right?
A hundred bucks says I can
bang her by the morning.
- Oh, come on.
- I'll take that bet.
You're so busted.
Nice mike.
Missed a spot.
- Sorry, what?
- I said you missed a spot.
Oh, I know how to hit the spot.
Don't you worry about that.
I'll hold your camera.
You go kick his ass, okay?
That's how you
do pick and roll.
Oh, yeah? Is that
how you do it?
He'll show you
how to do it later.
It's nighttime here...
...and the firefighters take
turns sleeping in these rooms here.
But if the alarm rings, they can be up
and on the truck in under one minute.
Let's check out the room.
Can you get in here?
It's like my college
dorm without the pink.
Attention, 222 Truck 16,
- Watch your back.
- Hey.
Looks like you got your call.
- Just try to keep up.
- You okay?
- We're going to the pole hole.
- Come on, come on.
- Got it?
- What you wanna do?
I can't slide down there.
Come here, come
here, come this way.
Careful, okay? We have
to get on that truck.
- There are like 15 stairs.
- I got it.
- You be careful.
- Keep going, keep going.
- It's this way?
- Yeah. Yeah, keep going.
- Be careful.
- Make a quick right.
Make a quick right, baby.
Just jump in the back.
- Jump in.
- Buckle up.
- We're almost in.
- You guys in?
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Yep?
Nice job.
What kind of call is this?
Probably just a medical.
- Okay.
- We'll find out when we get there.
You seem to have
kept shooting.
Ready?
Ready, set. Ready, set.
Okay, good.
Most little girls wanna be ballerinas
or princesses when they grow up.
I used to tell my mom, "Someday,
I'm gonna grow up and be a fireman. "
Tonight, I am truly
living the dream.
It's so loud, I don't
think we can use any of it.
Scott, I am still
living the dream.
Thirty
- seventeen, go ahead,
All right, we got a
eight at 3 o'clock.
Keep calling out numbers.
What are you doing?
Well, Jake's the engineer.
He's actually a third
- generation engineer...
...but I have the
most important job.
Navigating?
No, I'm in charge of
the chick- o- meter.
When I see a
girl, I rate them.
So if I say there's
a eight at 3 o'clock...
...the guys know they
better look to the right.
You know, it's really funny. I always
thought firemen were so dignified.
Oh, no, no. I signed up
for brave and courageous.
- I don't do dignified.
- Yeah, I think we get that by now.
I see a nine at 2.
- Oh, we got a nine at 2.
- Yeah.
Whoa, that's a dude.
It's called a chick- o-
meter, not a dick- o- meter.
I think we're good.
You're fired. You
can't talk anymore.
So where do you
think the problem is?
Do you think it's over
there, around the corner?
Or maybe around there?
You're rotten, you know that?
To the core,
baby. To the core.
What are you taking with you?
Tools.
Really anything we might need
to break a lock or open a door.
- You're the one who called this in?
- Yeah.
Come, follow me.
Look at Probie's new turnouts.
I didn't know they
made them that new.
We're almost to the building.
Police are here. Might be
more serious than we thought.
Probably not.
A woman was screaming
bloody murder up there.
- It's Mrs. Espinoza.
- Two cops are up there.
- When did they get here?
- Five minutes ago.
- What's that sound?
- Sound of the building.
It's very old.
- He insists on fixing everything.
- Wanda, please.
- What apartment number?
- It's up here.
- Go back to your apartments.
- We heard screams.
Well, at least
get out of the way.
- Are they with you?
- Yeah. They're shadowing us.
Then they're your
responsibility.
I tell you not to film
something, don't film it.
- I tell you to get lost, you get lost.
- No problem.
Here on the second floor on the
right. It's an old woman, lives alone.
Probably fell. Neighbors
heard screams, called it in.
What are those people doing?
You wouldn't believe the way
she screamed. It was crazy.
Neighbors say she's weird.
Doesn't talk to anybody.
She hasn't made a sound.
- Who are they?
- They're with Fire.
- I told them not to get in the way.
- Great. That's all we need.
Hello, ma'am, can you
hear me? It's L.A.P.D.
Ma'am, open up the door.
I'm here with paramedics.
We're gonna come in to help you.
If you're near the door, I
need you to move away from it.
- Hey, I got the keys.
- Then get in here, sir. Come on.
- 2A.
- Help us out here.
Just a second.
Yeah, here we are.
She must have added locks.
- I'm gonna do an intro.
- Yeah, you're good.
Okay. We're standing outside
an elderly woman's apartment.
Neighbors heard
screams and called 911.
The fire department's
about to begin the rescue.
Police say that she lives
alone, she's not very social-
I need you to get back,
brother, please, this time.
Ma'am, we're the police.
We're here to help you.
Ma'am? Ma'am?
Ma'am, can you hear us?
- What's her name?
- Mrs. Espinoza.
There's no need to worry, Mrs.
Espinoza. We're here to help you.
Okay, ma'am.
- It's okay.
- It's all right.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Ma'am? We're
right here, ma'am.
- It's okay.
- Ma'am.
- Jesus.
- Are you okay?
You okay? Come here.
Ma'am, it's
- We're the police.
- Ma'am.
- We're here to help you.
It's all right, is there anybody else
in the apartment? Any more animals?
- It's gonna be okay, ma'am.
- All right.
It's okay, all right?
It's all right.
Ma'am, ma'am.
It's all right.
It's all right.
All right. Okay, okay.
Okay, all right.
All right. Are you hurt?
All right, are you hurt?
- No.
- Okay, okay.
We're gonna get you
some medical help.
No, no, no. Please, don't.
No, are you okay?
Are you okay, ma'am?
No, no, no.
Okay, okay, okay.
You're gonna be okay. You're
gonna be okay, all right?
- Okay, just relax.
- Just relax.
- Just calm down.
- Just calm down.
- Turn that thing off.
- Turn that off.
Give us some room.
- Come on, man.
- Gloves on, Danny.
Where's that
blood coming from?
Hey, chief, we're gonna
need an ambulance here.
Copy, On our way,
Mrs. Espinoza, it's
all gonna be all right.
All right, I just need
you to calm down, okay?
It's all right. Nobody's
here to hurt you.
We can't help you
unless you calm down.
- An ambulance is on its way right now.
- All right.
Let's just clear a space.
Danny, get everybody out of here
until the ambulance gets here.
Get her off. Get
off. Get her off.
Get him on the floor.
Get him on the floor.
No. We are not moving him.
- We are waiting for the ambulance.
- Do you see an ambulance?
We have to get him downstairs.
- All right. Come on, come on. Okay.
- Grab the arm.
Come on. Come on, I got it.
Come on, lean down.
I got her. I got her.
Let's go.
- Get the fuck out of the way.
- Go, Scott.
Move that camera.
Come on, let's go, let's go.
- Did we get that?
- Move, move, move.
- Let's go, open that door.
- Let's go.
- Be careful down the stairs.
- Hang in there, buddy.
Tape everything, you
hear me? Tape everything.
Move. Move. Move.
- Open the door.
- It's locked.
How can that be?
- Open it, open it.
- Open.
- What do you mean?
- They won't let us out.
- Who locked those doors?
- It's not us.
Something is closing
it from outside.
We need an ambulance.
Open the door. Open the door.
Is there a doctor
in the house?
- You're a doctor?
- I'm a vet.
- Come on.
- Get over here.
- Put some pressure on that wound.
- Give me that rag.
Get something.
- Back up, back up.
- Cover him up.
Why are they locking
if there's a fire?
There's no fire,
Wanda. There is no fire.
We have an officer down.
We have an officer down.
I need an ambulance
immediately. I need backup.
Does anybody copy?
I have a fucking
hurt officer here.
What's going on?
Hey, what's happening?
Why can't we leave?
I know no more than
you do right now.
Back up.
My partner's on
the floor bleeding.
- Quiet.
- Please remain calm,
We are working hard to get
you out of the building,
Please follow the
officers' instructions,
This will all be over shortly,
- What will all be over?
- What's going on?
Why are we locked
in our building?
Be calm. That's
what that means.
Please remain calm and everything's
- Get the camera out of here.
Don't touch the camera. We
have every right to shoot.
- I'm tired of the camera.
- People need to see what's going on.
I'm in charge
here. Turn it off-
If you were, you'd be worried
about getting your partner out.
Not whether we're shooting.
You are two steps from
being arrested, okay?
This man will bleed to death.
Everybody stop fighting,
okay? Stop fighting.
We need to get this
man out of here.
- What's behind that door?
- That's a fabric workshop.
- What is it?
- Fabric, fabric.
- Is there a way out from there?
- Yeah, through the back. Come, come.
- Keep them back.
- Please, please.
You're not helping
the situation. Okay?
My husband's outside.
Said there are cops.
Blocked off the street.
He was getting antibiotics.
We gotta do something-
What the fuck.
- Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus, Fletch.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Okay, come on.
- Don't move him.
- No, we have to, we have to.
- Don't move him.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
All right, he's
still got a pulse.
Shit.
Get the vet over
here. Get the vet now.
- Vet, here, now.
- Get over here.
- Come here.
- Keep an eye on him.
He's still got a
pulse. Take care of him.
Okay, back away.
All right. Come
with me, let's go.
Come on, come on. You
two stay here, all right?
Stay here.
Keep an eye on my
partner, please.
Come on.
Let's get upstairs.
Come on, let's get upstairs.
I'm coming.
The sound's coming
from in there.
Okay.
Move over.
Oh, Scott, don't.
Don't go in there, Scott.
Scott.
- Watch out.
- Oh, my God.
She's dead.
She's dead.
- She's dead.
- What?
What are you two doing
here? Get the camera back.
We need to get you
guys out of here.
Ma'am. Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am?
Ma'am, listen to me. Can
you hear me, Miss Espinoza?
I need you to stay right
where you are, okay?
All right? We
wanna help you here.
Put your hands in the
air for me, Mrs. Espinoza.
Okay? Put your
hands in the air.
Oh, my God.
Let's go.
Put the gun down. Let's go.
- She was coming right at us.
- Yeah.
- You saw that, right?
- Yeah, I saw it.
Shit. Okay.
Okay, you saw that, right?
Okay. All right.
Let's just get downstairs.
Let's get downstairs.
Hey, hey, hey.
Easy, easy, easy.
Did you get that?
Yeah.
Show it to me.
- Look, don't worry. I got it.
- I said show it to me!.
Okay. Okay, okay.
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. I think-
Is everything okay?
We should probably just
get down the stairs, okay?
I know, I know, I know.
- Oh, my God.
- We just have to get downstairs.
Fire department.
I need you to
open up the door.
Fire department.
Fire department. We need everyone
to gather downstairs in the atrium.
Yes, we need you
to go downstairs.
- Was there a fire?
- No, it's just a precaution.
Just a precaution for what?
Look, we just need
you to get downstairs.
Does this have anything to
do with the cable being out?
- Come on, let's go.
- What? Wait, wait, wait.
- What if I don't wanna go?
- Then I'd be forced to force you.
Hi. I'm with the
fire department.
We need everyone to
gather in the atrium.
Do you speak English?
Do you speak English?
English? No.
Okay, we need everybody
downstairs, so...
All right, there's people down there,
and we need you two to go there.
You understand?
Fire department.
Fire department.
Ma'am?
Hello, ma'am?
Ma'am, I'm with
the fire department.
We need you to quickly and calmly
walk down to the lobby, please.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am.
Ma'am, we need you to
get downstairs, okay?
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
- You wanna give me a hand?
- Yeah.
- I don't know that that's a good idea.
- She needs help.
Just grab her.
Okay. Now lift her up.
Okay.
We're just taking you
downstairs, okay, ma'am?
All right?
Oh, Jesus.
Okay? Okay?
Okay? Yeah.
Oh, she's really sick.
Holy shit. Did you see that?
That rat just totally came
after me. Hey, did you see that?
Come on.
Un- fucking-
believable.
- Oh, my God, look at Elise.
- Somebody grab that chair.
- What's wrong with her?
- Set her down, set her down.
Can't stop the bleeding. Get him
to a hospital. He's gonna die.
Stay here. I'm
gonna check the exit.
No, no, wait. We are
under strict orders-
We're under orders to
stay in the hall. Help me.
Fuck your orders, all
right? My friend's dying!
- I'm coming
out. - Do not-
- Didn't catch that. You're breaking up.
- Two people have died.
Two others are in need of medical
care. Police have blocked off the exit.
They've given us no explanation.
We're trying to find a way out.
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.
- Get away from the window.
- Go, go.
You need to remain
in the building.
We have civilians in here.
Briana, don't.
Attention, please, Do not
try to leave the building,
All exits have been
sealed, Just stay calm,
We will send someone in there
shortly to assess the situation,
Thank you for
your cooperation,
What are we supposed to do?
- What are we supposed to do?
- Just wait.
There's five there.
What happened?
Sir, sir, sir.
Give me your headphones.
No, you're not
getting my question.
Not getting my question.
I'm asking why they're
calling this a BNC.
- What's a BNC?
- I don't know.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is somebody there?
- Hello?
Honey, hello?
Why is the phone breaking?
Why is it not working?
- What's a BNC? - Who
said anything about-?
- You. You're still miked.
- Wait.
- What? -
Don't jump to-
What's a BNC? What is it?
They're calling this a BNC?
A biological, nuclear
or chemical threat.
- Oh, my God.
- Nuclear?
- What?
- No, don't worry, okay?
- It's more common than you think.
- Supposed to be reassuring?
Our cell phones don't work.
Neither do the TVs or our radios.
- Why are they isolating us?
- I don't know.
My daughter has a fever.
- What does she have?
- They're pointing guns.
You can't keep
us trapped here.
- We're all trapped.
- That's right.
We are all trapped in
here. Step over here.
- Here.
- What will they do?
- Step over here, please.
- Jake, Jake.
There might be
- From the office on the second floor, there is an overhang.
Maybe we can use to
jump down to the patio.
- Let's go.
- I show you.
I'm going with you.
Don't turn the light on.
I don't want anyone
knowing we're in here.
Careful.
- When I open the
window- - Yeah?
go to the right side and jump.
It's only two
and a half meters.
Get away from the window.
- For your own safety.
- No.
- Step away.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Step away.
- Wait, listen.
Can you see me?
Can you see me?
- What are you doing?
- We have a film crew in here.
Tell your boss we
have a TV crew in here.
We are filming
this. Please, wait.
People are gonna see
what you're doing to us.
- Why can't we go out?
- People are gonna see this.
Please. Wait.
What are you doing in here?
- You knew about this, didn't you?
- Knew what?
That they're
sealing us in here.
What the fuck is this?
- What is going on?
- You tell us.
I don't know anything and don't you
fucking put your hands on me again.
I don't know anything, okay?
Get this fucking camera out.
- Don't touch me.
- Don't touch that camera.
We need to show people
what's going on here.
- Only proof we have.
- Don't you get it?
You're locked in here like us. You
think they give a shit about you?
- Step back.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Let's all just calm down, all right?
- Shut up.
- Put the gun down.
- Shut up.
Go back downstairs now, okay?
Yeah, okay, okay, but-
Shut up!
Damn. Go back downstairs.
This thing is
getting to all of us.
No one here is
gonna hurt you, okay?
We're trying to get out.
That's all we're trying to do.
Just put the gun down.
I'm sorry, man.
- I'm sorry, all right?
- Yeah.
I was just freaked
out. Let's go.
- We all are.
- Go downstairs, okay?
- All right?
- Yeah, let's get downstairs, man.
Shit.
Fuck.
Grab his legs, okay?
Come on, let's go.
What we'll do is we'll
roll him on his side.
We just have to
be really careful.
- What time is it?
- One- thirty- seven.
Five, four, three...
It's 1:37 in the morning,
and everyone is scared.
They've given us no information,
cut off communication...
...from walkie talkies and cell phones
to the building's cable and Internet.
The people trapped
here, myself included...
...can't help but ask why.
How's he doing?
Well, he's not good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Excuse me. It's
Terrence, right?
- No, Lawrence.
- Lawrence, right.
Listen, I've got a ton of Vicodin
in my apartment, if that will help.
Yeah, that's gonna help.
I'll just
- I'll grab a bunch of stuff.
I basically got a
pharmacy up there.
You can't arrest me for that,
because of self- incrimination-
Sir, you are the least of
my worries right now, okay?
- All right, I was just asking.
- Go.
Do what you're
gonna do, please.
I'm going. I'm going.
You ever seen anything
like this before?
No, I've never seen
anything like this.
Mostly because I'm a vet.
I don't usually treat
people. Dogs and cats, mostly.
All I can really do is I can dress
their wounds and try to comfort them.
How are the injured men doing?
They both lost a lot of blood,
and the fireman over here...
...he's got a bunch of broken bones
and probable internal bleeding.
Apparently, Mrs. Espinoza attacked
and bit them in some kind of a fit.
But honestly, I find that
a little hard to believe...
...that an old lady could do
something like this to two grown men.
Ready? Ready to film?
Okay.
- What's your name?
- Briana.
Briana, that's a very pretty
name. How old are you, Briana?
- Five.
- And who do you live with?
With my mom and my
dad and my dog, Max.
Max. I haven't met
Max. Where is he?
My dad took him to the
vet because he's sick.
- You sound a little sick yourself.
- Yeah.
- She's had it for weeks,
it's not like- - You know what?
If you don't mind, I'd like to keep
you quiet while I interview Briana.
It confuses the audience when
people talk from of fcamera.
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's okay.
- I'll interview you afterwards.
- No, that's fine.
- Okay.
- We don't need that.
Okay, thank you.
I don't like being sick.
Yeah, I don't like
being sick either.
Briana, you're a
very brave girl...
...and I'm really happy
we got a chance to meet.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
She's been fearless
since she was little.
She's an incredibly
strong child.
Okay? Okay.
Why don't you just start
by introducing yourselves?
Well, I'm Ber
- I'm Bernard. This is my roommate, Sadie.
And this is Martini.
And how long have you
lived in the building?
I've lived here six years.
I've been here two
and a half years.
And what do you
do for a living?
I'm an opera teacher.
Sadie's my best
student, my protege.
- Oh, my God.
- Fletcher.
Where's the vet?
Oh, my God.
Where the hell is the doctor?
I got him, got him, got him.
Hold him, hold him. Hold
his neck, hold his neck.
What is that?
- Hold it over, hold his neck.
- Go, go, go.
Oh, my God, is he still alive?
Hold him still, hold him
still. He's gonna go down.
Martini.
Sadie, stay here. Stay.
No, no, stay here, stay here.
No, the dog will come back.
Martini.
Hold him.
- Okay, I have to show you something.
- What?
Have to show you
something. Just a sec.
I think I know what this is.
- Come, come look, look, look.
- Oh, Jesus.
Her tear ducts and salivary
glands are constantly flowing.
She seems to be unable
to swallow or speak.
She has a fever,
she's confused.
She has some degree of
paralysis and delirium.
These are all rabies symptoms.
- Are you sure?
- I'm a vet.
Never seen it in humans, but
I know what rabies look like.
Are you trying to tell me
these people have rabies?
Tears, saliva, fever.
Tears, saliva, fever.
They have what she has.
But here's the thing. Rabies
takes months for symptoms to show.
This is taking minutes. I mean,
rabies never acts this fast.
How does rabies
spread? Through bites?
No, it's passed through anything wet.
Blood, saliva, any mucous membrane.
So if you get their
blood on you, you're okay.
But if you get
their blood on you...
...and it gets into a cut,
into your mouth, eyes...
...then you're not okay.
How's it cured?
No, there's no cure.
People get shots
in their stomach.
Before symptoms
starts showing.
Once symptoms show, rabies
is 100 percent fatal.
Shit.
Yeah, shit.
- Where are you going? Where?
- I'm going up to my apartment.
- What?
- I am going upstairs.
You can't do that.
- Why?
- Come down.
- Why?
- What do you mean?
- Why can't I go?
- We gonna do this all night?
- You know why?
- Because it's not safe there.
Oh, yeah, because it's
really safe down here.
- You're drunk.
- You know what?
It seems to me, if this is
spreading, maybe we should separate...
...instead of sitting
here in a big group.
You done? You finished?
- You done?
- You know what?
I have a God given right to protect
myself as I see fit, so you know what?
- I'm gonna go
upstairs- - Step back.
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna
barricade the shit out of it.
- Where do you think they're going?
- You can all sit here and rot.
Oh, you are so close
to going to jail.
- Are you some kind of affirmative-?
- You are so close to going to jail.
- Hey.
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- What?
- Where are you going?
Look, this lets out right
next to our apartment.
We wanna see if there's
anything on the news about this.
- But the cable's out.
- Cable?
We still use rabbit
ears on our TV.
We're going with you. Wait,
wait, wait, we're going with you.
It's just up
here to the right.
You're good?
- Stop. Just stop.
- What?
Go back downstairs.
The door locked behind me.
Just stay there.
Oh, my God. Oh, God.
Hey, look out.
- Oh, my God!
- Look out.
No, no, no!
We can't just open the door. We need
something to hold the dog back with.
- Find something!
- There's a fire extinguisher.
Oh, my God.
Stop, stop.
Listen.
Turn it off,
Scott. Turn it off.
Oh, I forgot something.
- Shouldn't we shut the door?
- Close the door.
- Okay.
- I left the music on.
Folk music.
The TV's back here.
All right.
Okay.
It usually takes a
couple of seconds to...
There we go, all right.
- Fiddle with this-
- Make sure that-
No, I know what I'm doing.
- No, I'm- - Yeah,
I know, all right?
- ... third hour of our coverage,
- There.
- There it is.
- ... receiving conflicting reports,
hind me was comp
- Evacuated...
that the CDC...
Chief,
Tell us why the CDC is
entering the building,
Precaution, Everyone's
been evacuated,
What?
Why would he broadcast that?
Why would he say that?
What the fuck
is going on here?
- What happened?
- Power's out.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.
- What was that?
- Quiet.
Sadie, stay with
me. Sadie, come here.
Sadie, come over here.
Stay with me. It cannot be.
- Stay with me.
- You gotta close that door.
Sadie, look out.
- Get off me.
- Oh, my God.
Get off of me.
Bernard, stay with me.
Hit her again!
Oh, my God.
Angela, you have blood
all over your shirt.
- Scott.
- What?
Scott.
What do you want?
You okay?
Yeah, I'm just fine.
I mean, I just killed
something with my camera...
...and, you know,
I'm just fine.
Yeah.
Scott.
What, Angela? What you...?
I need a moment now.
I'm with you.
- I'm with you, you're with me, okay?
- Okay, okay, okay, we're here.
We're here
together, all right?
We get out of here as fast as
we fucking can, you hear me?
- Okay, okay.
- Together?
- That everybody?
- Getting the last one.
All right, keep going.
All right, it's been a long,
exhausting night for all of us...
...but we just got
word from outside.
Well, it's about bloody
fucking time, isn't it?
Yes, they told me they're
sending in the CDC.
- CDC? -
What's-?
- Center for Disease Control.
- Why?
Yes, but relax, it's fine.
They're gonna come in.
They're gonna run blood tests
on residents to clarify things.
- Just the residents?
- No, everybody.
Everybody, so once
they check it out...
...make sure everything's okay,
we should be able to get out.
- Oh, thank God.
- That won't work.
- What are you talking about?
- That doesn't work, not for rabies.
- Nobody said anything about rabies.
- I did, I told you it was rabies.
How do you test for rabies?
There's only one way. You
gotta get a brain sample.
- Come on.
- Man, just shut up.
- What you have to do.
- Let's make sure everyone's here.
A simple "here" will be fine.
So let's get started.
- How many units per floor?
- Three.
- There are three.
- Okay.
Second floor, Unit A, that's
where Mrs. Espinoza lives?
- Yes.
- Who's in B?
- Me and Sadie.
- Here.
Who's in Unit C?
Unit C.
The lawyer.
- Randy.
- Elevat-
All right, third floor,
Unit A. Who's up there?
That's me, my daughter and my
husband, who's been outside-
Yes, yes, yes, we
know. Thank you.
- Unit B, please.
- Us.
- My wife and me.
- Who's in Unit C?
- Vacant.
- Why we doing this?
- Vacant. -
Nobody's been there-
- Fourth floor, Unit A, who's up there?
- That was Elise. She's dead.
- What?
- She's dead?
- 4B, who's in B?
- It's me, me, here.
- Who's in C?
- It's them.
You two?
They don't understand
you. Them and her father.
- And her father's upstairs?
- Sick, he's paralytic.
Maybe this is all his fault.
- How do you know? You don't know- -
Listen up, all right, let's finish up.
- Okay.
- Somebody knows.
What was I even gonna say?
Who lives in the attic?
A man from Boston. He rents it,
but I haven't seen him in months.
Wait, if her father's upstairs,
should we bring him down?
What if he's the cause? We
can't bring sick people here.
- Your daughter's sick, isn't she?
- She has fever. Hardly the same.
Yeah, so we should bring
her father downstairs.
- Hey, hey.
- Stop, stop it.
- Hey.
- Stop fighting.
- Listen.
- How many times you gonna do this?
Nobody's going.
We're gonna stay here.
They'll let us know when
they wanna move us, period.
Can we finish?
- Fine.
- Thank you.
The cleaning lady.
Yeah, the cleaning lady.
- The cleaning lady was here.
- I saw her this morning.
She's deceased.
- What?
- What did he say?
- What?
- She's gone.
stand back from the door,
Open the door.
- Show me your hands.
- L.A.P.D.
CDC's now making their
way into the building.
There are security
measures in place.
We still have no
idea what's happening.
From the look of the precaution
that they're taking...
...it's something
very serious.
I want you to just
keep this area clear.
This is...
This is blood from
my partner here.
He's in the back. This blood
is from the second firefighter.
You, turn it off.
Turn it off now.
Now. Turn it off.
Okay, okay, it's off.
Jesus.
Okay, everyone here.
Everybody here is good.
The two guys are in the back.
That's all we can tell you.
- I don't know anything else right now.
- Okay.
Just take me to the injured.
Everyone else stays here.
You heard him. Stay here.
Clear this area.
They tell us to stay calm, and
they come dressed like that?
- It's gonna be all right.
- What? You honestly believe that?
I'm gonna open it.
Can you see?
That's good. That's good.
I'm gonna take
samples from both men.
Up here. Up here.
- Okay.
- Can you get up there?
Yeah, okay, cool.
Hey, hold this, hold this.
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
You got it?
Okay, give it to me.
Give me the camera, come on.
Give me the camera.
- Can you see?
- Yeah.
What's happening?
- They're handcuffing him.
- Who?
Fletcher.
The other one's got a syringe.
He just gave Fletcher a shot.
- Oh, shit.
- What?
He's got a drill.
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?
I think the vet was right.
I think he's taking
a brain sample.
- Holy shit.
- Scott?
Hey, look out.
Angela, run. Run!
The vet's in there.
He's still in there.
- Open the door.
- We can't, he's been bitten.
- Come on, let him out.
- I'm not infected, you're wrong.
I'm not infected.
I'm all right.
- They didn't get me.
- What are you talking about?
- Are you sure he's been bitten?
- Yes, and I'm not taking any chances.
Back away till the infected
people have been handcuffed.
Infected with what?
- Would you get that out of my face?
- What happens happens in the open.
They have a right
to shoot this, okay?
- You okay?
- Lawrence.
Lawrence, you okay?
God, this isn't right.
Calm down, calm down. No.
- It's not right. - It would
not be right to let him out-
You tell us what's going on.
- I'm not authorized
to tell- - Bullshit.
You left my friend because
he tried to kill you.
Tell us what you know.
- Tell us what you know.
- Yeah, okay, goddamn, okay.
We got a call from a vet who
had a sick dog brought in.
They ran the routine tests, it was
nothing they'd ever seen before.
Then it started attacking
the other animals.
And within an hour, all
the injured animals...
...showed the same
kind of aggression.
Yeah. The dog's collar
led us to this building.
Was the dog's name Max?
Yes.
- She only has bronchitis.
- Bullshit, bronchitis.
- No, don't you dare.
- Kathy.
- Bronchitis.
- We need to find out.
Relax, ma'am. Relax.
We have to be sure.
No, get away from me.
Dog spread the infection
through his saliva.
We just gotta check.
- Let him do a check, ma'am.
- No.
That's all we gotta do.
That's all she has,
just bronchitis.
- No.
- Go, go.
Get back. Get back.
Get back. Watch out.
Run, Briana. Run, sweetheart.
- Get the girl.
- No, get away from her.
- Hold her. Hold her.
- Run!
- Run, sweetie, please!
- Get the handcuffs.
- Come on, come on.
- No, let me go.
Don't hurt her. Please!
Please, you need to
get us out of here.
Stop it! Stop it!
- Cuff her.
- No.
Come here. Come.
- Honey.
- She's cuffed.
- Honey.
- Back away.
Back away. Calm down,
calm down, calm down.
- No.
- Father.
- Father.
- What father?
- Her father's sick in bed.
- Nobody told me that.
We thought everyone
was down here.
All right, here. Take this.
Get the girl and
inject her with it.
- No, no.
- And you, bring everybody down here.
Bring Briana. Okay.
Kathy, we're gonna get her.
We're gonna bring her down.
- Run, honey!
- Going up.

- Get away!
Get away from her! Honey.

Get away from her.
Oh, God.
Slow down, slow

Okay, okay. All right.

- The old lady's gone.
Briana?
Okay. Just take it easy, okay?

Oh, Briana.

Shit.
Shit, I'm sorry.
Briana?
Oh, shit.
Briana?
Oh, I think she's
in here, Jake.
Hell.
She's over there.
She's over there.
You all right?
Now, I need you to
give me your hand, okay?
Okay?
What happened to her eyes?
Please don't stop.
Please, don't.
Get her off me.
Go, go.
She bit me. Go, Jake!
- Get out of here.
- Go, go, go.
Come on, go. Let's go.
- Go, go, go.
- They're getting out.
They're getting out.
No, no, no.
- Go back.
- They're getting out.
Oh, they're getting
out. Run, run!
Don't go. Wait!
They're getting close. Run.
Okay. Run! Run!
Don't leave me.
- Don't leave me.
- I'm not gonna leave her.
- Don't leave me.
- We have to get out of here.
It's not right!
It's not right!
- Come on.
- No, no, not that way. This way.
Hurry up, come on.
Where are the others?
Come on, let's go.
Hurry up.
- Lock it, lock it, lock it!
- Hurry up.
Help me, help me.

Angie?
No.
- Hey, what about you?
- No, no.
Hey, you.
On the floor.
- Hey, you been bitten?
- No, no.
Jake, did you find
the little girl?
Who gives a shit
about the little girl?
All right. We've lost
control of the building.
We're fucked.
Damn it.
I don't understand.
I don't understand. They
were biting her face off.
I don't know what
the fuck is happening.
- Damn it.
- I don't understand.
We could all be infected by
now. We gotta get out of here.
I'm not moving. I'm done.
- I'm not moving.
- Hey, we wait here, we wait here.
- We have to get out of here.
- Listen.
We have to stay here and wait
till somebody come and get us.
They're not gonna
come and get us.
- Oh, yes, they will.
- They are not gonna come!
They don't give a shit about
us! They're gonna let us die!
They don't care about us.
Scott, we're gonna die!
- Oh, fuck.
- She's right.
- Who was that?
- It was the doctor.
What?
- I'm gonna kill you.
- I've been bit.
You left us down there.
Piece of shit.
I've been bitten.
He's been bitten.
He's been bitten. Get back.
Close those doors.
Somebody close
those fucking doors.
It won't hold him.
It's not gonna
hold him for long.
- Get back.
- She's bleeding.
She's bleeding.
Sadie.
No.
We have to kill her.
No, no.
Hey, hey, hey, you're not
gonna fucking touch her.
We gotta get out.
Gotta get out.
Gotta get out of here. Gotta

Help me get out of here.
Let me get out

Hey, hey.
Please. Hey!
Hey. Hey.
Please, get me-
Oh, my God.
Sniper!
Scott.
They're not gonna let us
out of here alive, are they?
No.
I don't think so.
- There might be a way out.
- What?
Jake, there might
be a way out.
How? How do we
get out of here?
Listen, Jake.
There is a drain cover in the
basement that joins up with the sewers.
- We need the key, we need the key.
- The keys are in our apartment.
Come with us.
Come with us! You
have to come with us!
I won't leave him.
I can't leave him.
Leave him alone.
Oh, my God!
We have to get out of here!
We have to get the key.
Key's in Yuri's apartment.
Know where he lives?
You made the list of
residents. Where does he live?
I can't remember
where it's at.
You have to think about
it. Think, think, think.
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Think!
I don't know which apartment. I
don't know which apartment it is.
Mailboxes, mailboxes.
Mailboxes.
Yeah, get the hammer.
- Grab the hammer.
- I got it, I got it.
- Go.
- Keep moving.
Oh, keep moving,
man. Keep moving.
I'm coming.
Where is it? Which one is it?
Hurry.
Yuri Ivanov, 3B.
Three. Get to the elevator.
- Three. Oh, God.
- Oh, shit.
Get to the elevator.
But the electricity?
It should run on auxiliary
power. We're good.
She's cuffed. We can get by.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
- Oh, God.
- Get in.
Get in.
Get in. Get in.
Hurry! Hurry. Hurry.
Close the fucking door.
Easy, easy.
But it's gonna stop at two.
We're gonna stop at two!
- The light, the light!

- The light.
Come on. Come on, you

They won't close.
They won't close.

No, you haven't. I saw it.
I was bitten!
Angie, Angie, they didn't get
you. You didn't get bitten.

We can't stay the fuck down

I won't have a light
if you go up there!

- I'll be in the dark!
Angie, stay with me!
Angie, stay with me!
Look, I'm gonna have to
take this light off you.
Here, grab my waist.
Okay, just grab my waist.
Good.
Scott, what happened?
What happened?
- Oh, something hit the camera.
- Don't turn it off, fix it.
- I'm trying. Damn it, I'm trying.
- Please!
I'm trying.
Look, I'm gonna put
the night vision on.
I'll put the night
vision on. Hold on.
Just stay there, okay?

Okay, good. Come on, come on.
Hey, you're doing
good. Come around.
Come around my back. Hold on.
Hold on. We'll be okay, okay?
I just gotta find

Okay? Okay.

out, I promise.
Just give me a minute.
What's that? Stay

Why? Why? Why?
Get down. Get down.
Don't make a sound.
Don't make a sound.
It can't see us.
If it can't hear
us, it won't find us.
Okay, get ready. We're
gonna try to get by it.
Run!
Run!
Scott!
