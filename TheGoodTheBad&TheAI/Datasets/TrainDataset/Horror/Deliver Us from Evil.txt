We're taking fire!
We're taking sustained fire!
Watch your six!
Move it! Let's go!
Give me some cover fire!
Go, go!
Move out!
Let's go!
Jimmy, go with him.
Fuck.
Jesus, what's that smell?
Oh, no.
What is that?
What the fuck is that?
What the...
Shit!
Where is it?
Garbage man found it in the
bottom of the dumpster.
It's over there now.
Is that Sarchie?
Yeah, him and Butler
were first on the scene.
Officer, if I could take that.
Officer, if I could
take that now, please.
What's that?
- What?
- On your head.
It's a hat.
It's a Red Sox hat.
I love the Red Sox.
Fuck that. You don't
even watch baseball.
I love baseball.
Okay, name me one
player on the Red Sox.
Larry Bird.
Don't laugh.
You think that's funny.
When a Yankee fan strings you up
by the balls for wearing that hat,
I'm gonna be sitting there,
I'm gonna be laughing my ass off.
Oh, come on, Sarchie,
we both know you don't laugh.
I'll be laughing my fucking ass off.
Six-Adam, respond to a
apartment 2 King,
Burnside to Grand Conk on the cross.
Six Spec Ops Sergeant to Central K.
Go, Sergeant.
Run a name check on the 10-52.
Ten-four. Just a second.
What, you want a domestic call?
Oh, shit. Radar?
You know, when your radar goes off,
you usually wind up with stitches?
You're an adrenaline junkie,
and without my radar,
you don't get your fix. Okay?
You're right, and for that,
I am grateful.
Six Special Ops,
the name of the 10-52
tenant is Jimmy Tratner.
Any warrants?
Tenant is 10-19.
What?
No warrants? Could Sarchie's radar
be off tonight, ladies and gentlemen?
Do you show a tenant occupation?
It says USMC.
Marine. Might think he's
still fighting the war.
Six Spec Ops, have Adam disregard.
We'll take the call.
- Oorah!
- Let's go.
Police, open up.
What?
- We got a call.
- Uh-huh.
Are you alone in there?
My wife.
We gotta see her.
Okay.
Maid's on vacation, huh?
Watch out for a dog.
Ma'am, are you all right?
Nothing happened. She's fine, see?
Now get the fuck out!
All right, put a shirt on. Let's go.
You ain't locking me up, man.
You wanna go the hard way?
Put your hands behind
your back right now.
He just...
He just went crazy.
You shut up!
Shit!
Mommy?
Sweetie, stay right there.
Everything's gonna be... Aah!
Butler!
I'm good.
Do you like to beat
your wife and kid? Huh?
Next time you think about doing that,
you think of me, okay?
Come on, come on, that's enough.
Come on, that's enough.
He's a veteran, for Christ's sakes.
Stitches.
Told you, Radar-Man.
Double shot, Johnnie
Walker Black, please.
You're all sweaty.
You look good sweaty.
You could sip that, you know.
It's not medicine.
Oh, sweetheart,
it is for me.
You have a good night.
You, too.
Four-Six Special Ops Sergeant,
you have a possible 10-25
at River Parkway and Fordham Road.
The perp is possibly
still on the scene.
Hey, Sergeant Sarchie, right?
I read about you in the
paper a few years back.
Sarge here took down Marvin
the Molester. Remember him?
That was you? Nice.
What's the damage here?
It happened right at closing.
Some woman flipped out,
threw her own kid in the moat.
Little boy, two years old.
Jeez.
Lions eat him?
No, they've been put up all day.
Good. I hate cats.
The kid cracked his head pretty good.
EMS. took him to St. Barnabas.
They think he'll be okay.
Where's the woman?
She split against the crowd.
Now, we can't find her.
She must be hiding
somewhere in the park.
Why is it so dark in here?
Weirdest thing.
Right after the lady tossed the kid,
the whole zoo lost power.
We can't see shit.
All we got is emergency power
from the backup gennies.
That's why we called for Special Ops.
We need you guys to find her.
This place is creepy after hours.
We should split up.
I'll go this way.
Fuck you.
Everybody loves my baby.
Everybody loves my baby.
Ma'am, what's wrong with you?
He tried to run. He tried to run.
Can you hear me?
Why did you do that to your kid?
And we're going to...
Break, break, break.
What's she saying?
Break on through to the other side.
It's The Doors. She's quoting
a song. Jim Morrison.
- Oh, yeah.
- Doors.
Break on through to the other side.
Break on through to the other side.
Break, break, break...
Break on through to the other side.
Drugs, probably.
Or maybe she's just a big fan.
You guys get any statements
from the witnesses
who saw her throw the kid?
Only two.
People got out of here fast
when the power went out.
Who's that?
Oh. Gosh.
I thought he was finished.
He's been at it since
early this morning.
Did you guys get a
statement from him?
No, I didn't even realize
he was here till just now.
Hey, you!
Jesus.
Hey!
I wanna talk to you!
You stay right there!
Get me in there.
You stay right there.
Come on out.
Don't fucking shoot.
Don't piss them off.
Just get me out of here!
Oh, dear God!
Oh, dear!
Stay calm!
Don't panic!
Don't panic!
Just get back in here!
Oh, shit.
Good morning, beautiful.
Mmm.
Good morning, stinky.
You're the stink.
Hmm.
I don't want to get up.
Come on. I've been up all night.
Where's little stink?
Raring to go.
Mmm.
Go, Savannah, kick it.
Let's get it down here. Let's go!
Christina, you gotta run, baby!
You gotta run!
Oh, yeah!
Attagirrl!
Attaway, Christina!
Yeah, baby!
All right, Ralph, sign her out,
and she's off to Hanwell.
Is she drugged?
She's been sedated.
You know this lady?
Yeah, her name is Jane Crenna.
You got a name?
Joe Mendoza. She's one of my charges.
One of your "charges"?
What does that mean?
I'm a Jesuit priest.
Ain't they the priests
you always read about?
Dying in bed with hookers and shit?
There are worse ways to go.
Where's your collar, Padre?
I work undercover, like you.
Are you going with her?
He's here at the family's request.
They felt she needed a specialist.
Specialist.
Are you a psychiatrist, too?
No, I'm not.
Can you tell me exactly how she was
behaving when you first
saw her at the zoo?
Like she was nuts, that's how.
She's going to the loony
bin where she belongs.
When you arrested her,
did she seem unusually strong?
No, why?
No reason that would interest you.
But if you do think of
something more specific,
or if I can be of any help,
please call me.
Okay.
Do you think she's single?
Oh, shit.
No usable prints on the ladder
or any of the paintbrushes.
What about the security cams?
The zookeepers can't explain how
he let those goddamn lions loose.
Cameras were on the backup genny,
but the lawyers for the zoo
want a written request
for the footage.
Should only take a day or two.
I'm gonna find that
fucking freak painter.
I promise you.
Hi, Daddy.
I'm going to sleep now,
but first, I want to tell
you that I love you,
and I miss you, and I wish you
were home, and good night,
and I got a gold star
in class yesterday.
And I also love you, and miss you,
and if you're home in time,
I'll see you in the morning.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
That's okay. I'll get you another one.
Here, give Daddy a kiss.
Be safe tonight.
Sarchie. Hey, Sarchie? Watch this.
Lady's out of her fucking mind, man.
She's crazy. Out of her mind.
Why? What does it say?
She said that nobody's
been down in that basement
since it was painted two weeks ago,
but that's where all the strange
noises are coming from.
I'm so sick of these bullshit calls.
Waste of my fucking time.
Gordon, did you say something
about a room being painted?
Yeah, it was a basement.
This crazy lady down in Belmont
complaining about some
strange disturbances, noises,
shit moving around
on its own. Weird, huh?
And then today she gets
a call from her father
saying, "Shut the doors, the doors.
Shut the goddamn doors."
That's not so weird.
Yeah, but she swears it was her pop.
He's been dead for seven years.
She's a whack job, trust me.
Let me see that.
Nadler, you guys can skip this one.
We'll take the call.
Radar?
This is it.
I think the Addams Family lives here.
You know, the last time we
took somebody else's job,
you almost got eaten.
Yeah, if something eats me here,
feel free to say, "I told you so."
Salvatore Alberghetti?
We're from the 46 precinct.
May we come in?
Yes, please.
Sorry for, uh, mess.
It's, uh, much trouble here.
- You all, uh, sleeping in the living room?
- Yes.
We, uh...
Since worse, we sleep
by door in case...
No sleeping alone.
This is my wife, Serafina.
- The boy, Mario, he will tell.
- Hello.
Is nightmare!
Since a few weeks ago,
we started seeing and hearing things.
What kind of things?
Things moving and sounds,
mostly at night,
coming from the basement.
Come. This way.
Mama says, it's like the
whole house is possessed.
"Possessed"?
Gordon called it. She's a whack job.
She knows you don't believe,
but it's okay.
She says,
"Let me show you."
Do you ever change a
light bulb around here?
No matter how many times we get new,
they burn out in a few hours.
We get holy candles from priest,
but here, they no burn.
The candles won't burn?
No. We all try light them.
Many times.
This Jesus,
he came down off the wall and broke.
Jesus.
What the hell is wrong with it?
It's a cat.
That's what's wrong with it.
What are they saying?
They think
that down there
is where the evil comes from.
Excuse me.
All right.
Take the kid. Wait upstairs.
We are gonna go down and
check out the basement.
The bulb, it burn out.
No light down there.
After you.
Listen.
You missed your calling.
You should have been a plumber.
There. Look at that.
You wanna read him his rights
or shoot him while he's down?
You know, it stinks down here.
I'm gonna go get some air.
Watch your step.
Do me a favor. Get these lights on.
So these two painters you hired,
did they ever say
anything strange to you?
Tell you do anything?
No. They...
Barely speak.
Is one of them, no?
You tell me. This is his ID.
- His name was David Griggs.
- Si.
Did you ever meet him or the other
painter before you hired them?
No.
As far as we can tell,
the other painter
was the last person
to see Griggs alive.
So, did you ever get
a good look at him?
No.
Wore a hood.
A hood?
Dark.
Part of jacket.
F12. This is it.
Shit.
Griggs and Jane Crenna,
the lady from the zoo.
Sarch.
Griggs, body in the basement.
Jimmy, the wife-beater.
There.
That's the guy we're looking for.
Santino.
Oh, sweet Mary, that is sick.
- There you go, princess.
- Thanks, Daddy.
Christina, here's your toast.
Why doesn't Daddy
go to church with us?
Legend has it, your daddy used
to go before we were married.
Did Grandma make you
go when you were little?
I go Christmas and Easter. Doesn't
that pretty much cover it, anyway?
Christina, go wait for me in the car.
Bye, Daddy.
Bye.
I'm pregnant.
That's great.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
When did you find out?
A week ago.
A week? Why didn't you tell me?
You've been working a lot. It's okay.
Hey, honey...
I'm sorry. I'm happy. I am.
I'm so happy.
I know.
More time at home.
I understand the hours
you got to work,
but even when you're here,
you're not here.
I get it. I do.
I do.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
I love you.
Hey. Give me another one of these.
This one's full of static.
I also got that surveillance
video you requested.
Great. Set it up.
- Sign it out with Smith.
- Okay.
Hey.
Hey. Zoo clips are
in the comm center.
"Zoo clips"? Sounds like
my favorite porn site.
- Let's go.
- Go ahead. I'll meet you there.
What can I do for you, Father?
You must be Catholic.
It's the second time
you've called me Father.
I was an altar boy at Saint Ignatius.
I was raised Catholic.
Past tense.
Yeah, I guess I outgrew all that.
You outgrew God?
What do you want?
I came to see if you've made any
progress in Jane Crenna's case.
What makes you think
the case is still open?
Well, I went to the zoo
and asked them to let me see
the security camera recordings,
and they told me only the arresting
officers had permission for that.
Why do you want to
see the recordings?
To help me determine why Jane did it.
I can save you the time.
The reason she hurt her kid is
because she's fucking crazy,
and now, she's in the loony
bin where she belongs.
Jane Crenna is no lunatic.
You kidding me? I was there.
And I've known her for years.
Well, how do you
explain what she did?
That's not the issue here.
I just want to see the recordings.
No, you explain to me why
you think she's not crazy.
I believe Jane's problem
to be spiritual in nature.
I knew it.
I've experienced two types of evil
in this life, Officer Sarchie.
Secondary evil, the evil that men do.
I'm sure you know all about that.
I've seen enough.
And primary evil,
which is something else entirely.
Meaning what?
I'm sure you remember
that in Catholic teaching,
there are very specific signs that
indicate the presence of an evil spirit.
Well, Jane is demonstrating
many of them.
You think she's possessed?
I'm sorry, Padre,
but I think it's ridiculous
to blame invisible fairies
for the bad shit people do.
Okay? I've seen some horrible things
but nothing that can't be
explained by human nature.
Then you haven't seen true evil.
Look, Officer, I'm only here
because I care about Jane.
So if you see something
strange or inexplicable
on those recordings,
please call me. I need to know.
Okay, Father.
What you got?
Military files. DOD sent them over.
Name is Mick Santino.
Both he and our wife-beater Jimmy
served in Griggs' platoon in Iraq.
All three were
dishonorably discharged.
Why?
They attacked the battalion chaplain.
Chaplain?
Yeah, they cut him up pretty good.
All three served time
in the brig at Quantico
before the Corps cut them loose.
So does the Corps got a home
address on record for Santino?
Nope, just an old PO
box that's no longer his.
What about Jane Crenna?
That's Griggs' wife.
And the kid she tossed
at the zoo was theirs.
Look at this.
It's Griggs' autopsy report.
Suicide?
Yep. Griggs guzzled two
quarts of paint thinner
with no sign he was forced.
Now, he didn't wrap himself
up in the drop cloth,
and Santino was the
only one down there.
So, Santino watches Griggs kill
himself down in the basement.
Then later watches Griggs'
wife try and kill her own kid?
Yeah.
He's a bad influence.
What's that writing on the back wall?
Graffiti? Maybe he was
brought in to paint over it.
Graffiti in a lion's den?
Hmm.
She knew Santino.
So what was she doing there?
Look at him.
It's like nothing ever happened.
You hear that?
What?
Static.
It's like a bad connection.
I don't hear anything.
You hear that?
Hear what, man? There's nothing.
You didn't hear anything?
No static, no other voices?
Don't get nutty on me, Sarch.
There's no sound here.
These clips are silent.
You're fucking with me.
I can tell. You're a bad actor.
That's when I called out to him.
He's about to move behind the trees.
Son of a bitch knew
we'd be watching this.
Jeez.
That is just creepy.
Bullshit.
Is he fucking talking to the lion?
Don't tell me you didn't see that.
Are you okay?
We missed you at the game today.
I had something to do.
Mommy took me to Grandma's
house afierschooL
and I got a new stuffed
Angel Owl for my birthday!
And look!
Did she eat too much sugar?
Ma gave her some cupcakes.
"Some"?
Two. It's her birthday, Ralph.
Well, the party's Saturday.
What, your mother couldn't wait?
Why don't you get your butt off my
mother's couch when you say that?
Christina, settle down.
What's wrong?
Still that thing at the zoo?
- No.
- The zoo? Daddy, I wanna go to the zoo.
- I don't know.
- Daddy, look at me.
Daddy? Look at me!
Christina, will you shut up!
What the hell was that?
You never talk to her like that.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, Jen! Okay?
I got a guy
who beats his wife's face in,
in front of their kid,
and the next day he's back home.
All right.
I got a lady who throws
her kid into a ravine.
You want another one? Hmm?
Last week, an alleyway off Buck
Street, first call of the night,
I pull a baby out of the
bottom of a dumpster.
I'm giving it mouth-to-mouth.
It's already dead.
Just a little, tiny,
dead sack in my hands.
All right? There you go.
That's my week.
You didn't tell me.
No. No, I did not.
You want to talk about it now?
I walk through the sewer every night.
I don't want to come home
and do it again with you.
I'll talk to her.
She'll be all right.
Lucinda Tratner?
Yes. I remember you.
My husband's gone.
Jimmy hasn't hurt me again.
Do you know these other two men?
Jimmy served with them in Iraq.
Why do you ask?
Sergeant Griggs is dead.
When was the last time
you saw Mick Santino?
Two weeks ago.
He and Sergeant Griggs,
they started a painting company,
and as a favor to Jimmy,
they came over
and started painting Jimmy's office.
Can you show me the room?
My husband, Jimmy,
sometimes he has these fits
where he claws at things.
One night I found him in the street
clawing at the asphalt.
Sometimes he digs at the floor
so hard, his fingers bleed.
Does he use any drugs?
Mental problems?
- Hallucinations?
- No.
I don't know.
He came back broken.
I don't know him anymore.
A few nights ago, he started
to scare me again, and I left.
When I came back the next
morning, he was gone.
I haven't seen him since.
What's on these drives?
Jimmy was a combat videographer.
It's all footage from the war.
Do you mind if I stay for a
bit, take a look at these?
Shit.
Jesus, what's that smell?
Come on. Oh, no.
No.
What is that?
What the fuck is that?
What the... Aah!
Shit!
Mick! Mick!
Holy shit!
Fucking bats, man!
Oh, my God!
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here!
Mick, let's go!
The fuck are you doing?
Holy shit.
Oh, my God.
Mick?
What is it? What is that?
Ralph Sarchie, 46 precinct.
I'm meeting someone here.
No one called me about it.
You a doctor?
I'm the supervising physician.
And the receptionist, it looks like.
I'm here to talk to Jane Crenna.
Sorry, but that patient
is heavily medicated.
It's all right, Doctor. He's with me.
Hey, Father. Thanks for coming.
All right, 10 minutes
unless the patient is upset or
interfered with in any way.
Thank you, Doctor. This way.
What is this place?
The isolation floor.
Maximum security.
Upstairs is for the disturbed.
Down here is for the
dangerous and the deranged.
Jane?
You got a visitor.
Hello, Jane.
Do you remember me?
Do you know a man named Santino?
Mick.
That's right, Mick. Mick Santino.
Why'd you go visit him at the zoo?
Message.
He had a message for you?
Jane, what was the message
Santino had for you?
You speak Latin, huh?
What do you think of this?
Let go of my arm, Jane.
Let go of my goddamn arm!
Hey!
Shit.
Marvin.
Are you all right?
Gonna need a fucking HIV test.
I told you not to upset her!
Upset her? Look at my fucking arm!
Yeah, I'm on the phone
with your precinct!
I'm about to talk to your captain!
Yeah. Tell him I said hello.
You're okay. Calm down. Calm down.
You dropped this.
What's this writing mean?
Let's go get a drink.
What about this third photograph?
Where did you uncover the writing?
Inside the lion habitat at the zoo.
I went back there this morning.
These are messages to
the spirits of Babylon.
The images are Persian pictographs,
but the words are in Latin.
Persian and Latin?
Yeah. That's not odd in itself.
That mixture has been around
since before the time of Christ
when the Romans occupied
the Middle East.
But the Latin here refers to
providing a "gateway" or "portal."
So these messages,
they're references to doors?
Yes.
There must be an invitation
that opens a doorway
before an evil entity
can slip into our world.
Some people invite it themselves
by dabbling in the occult.
Others are just victims
of a curse, like this.
The message here provides a
point of entry for the demonic.
Here you go, guys. Hmm.
So you're not all pedophiles, huh?
Any other stereotypes you
want to hit while I'm here?
I've met a lot of priests.
You don't seem the type.
And I've known a lot of cops,
and you're exactly the type.
Seriously, why the priesthood?
I had a drug problem
when I was younger.
Bad one.
One morning, I woke up naked
in a pool of my own urine
in the middle of Kenmore Square
with a dirty needle of speedball
still sticking out of my arm.
I had a choice, to live or die.
It always comes down to a choice.
I chose God.
I got sober through Narcotics
Anonymous and joined the priesthood.
You're sober but you drink and smoke?
I'm NA, not AA.
These get me by.
They might kill me slowly,
but they won't kill me fast.
Not like heroin.
What about you?
When did you outgrow God?
When I was 12.
Some meth-head frying his brains
out broke into our house.
He was in the same room as
my mom who was sleeping.
You know what stopped him?
God didn't stop him. I did.
With a baseball bat.
You see, Father,
as we speak, every day,
out there, someone's getting hurt,
ripped off, murdered, raped.
Where's God when all
that's happening? Hmm?
In the hearts of people like you,
who put a stop to it.
I mean, we can talk all night
about the problem of evil,
but what about the problem of good?
I mean, if there's no God,
if the world is just
"survival of the fittest,"
then why are all the men in this room
willing to lay down their
lives for total strangers?
Hmm?
I brought something for you to hear.
My first year in the priesthood,
I met a young single
mother named Claudia.
She was brand-new in NA.
She had grown up
Catholic in Venezuela
and was convinced that there
was an evil presence in her home
here in the Bronx.
As her priest, I began a ritual
cleansing of the apartment,
not because I believed
that she was right,
but because I thought it
might put her mind atease.
What happened during that cleansing
changed me forever.
It was actually the
event that started me
down the path to
becoming this sort of...
Specialist.
Exactly. Specialist.
I now believe there was an evil
presence in Claudia's house,
because I watched it try to take
possession of her daughter.
You'll hear three voices
on the recording.
One belongs to me,
one belongs to Claudia,
and one of the voices is coming
from a five-year-old girl.
Mommy?
Mommy? I want to make them...
Just please make it stop!
I don't like this!
Please, Mommy!
Stop it, Priest.
Eventually, it retreated.
It let the girl go.
And from that moment on, I devoted
myself to the study of demonology.
Every culture, every religion since
humans dropped out of the trees
has practiced exorcism.
Most of them are bullshit. It's true.
But maybe 10, 15% just aren't.
Besides superhuman strength,
each possessed person
used an altered voice
and had clairvoyant powers.
They knew things they
could not have known.
So, tell me,
who's Marvin?
What?
Marvin.
The name Jane mentioned to you.
Perhaps another time.
You play pool?
Sure.
You know, I think it's no accident
that you're the man who
discovered these messages.
You seem to either
be attracting evil,
or you're uniquely able to detect it.
Even if you don't understand it.
Tell me something.
Do you sense when something
bad is happening on the street?
I get hunches.
My partner calls it my "radar."
Maybe you have been
called into the Work.
"The Work"?
Yeah.
And if you have,
I feel sorry for you, man.
Hey. Don't feel sorry for me.
You're the one who
took a vow for celibacy.
Hey.
Christina cried herself
to sleep tonight.
What? Why?
Because she heard scratching
noises under the floor in her room.
Told her it was just mice.
Scratching noises?
Yeah. She was really scared.
She's not hearing mice in the floor.
I know!
Did you hear the sounds?
No. I don't think she
really did, either.
Don't you get it?
The floor isn't the problem!
She doesn't feel safe,
because she needs you.
So do I.
Something's happening to me. Okay?
It's something I don't understand.
You got to talk to me.
You know, I need to know.
You know, I can help you,
but you got to let me in.
It's nothing.
I don't want to talk
about it, okay? Not right now.
So, this is all I get? This is it?
You get the best of me.
Yeah.
I hope not.
I hope this isn't the best.
Jesus Christ.
The message he painted opened
a door for the demonic.
Those who are susceptible can become
possessed when they see this.
So you're saying by
seeing this message,
Jane became possessed.
Yes.
And then she tried
to kill her own child.
Why?
That's the mystery of primary evil.
Its destructiveness makes
no sense. Not to us.
Santino saw this message in Iraq,
became possessed.
Now he's trying to recruit with it.
What this man is doing
must be stopped.
He can't be allowed to keep
creating these doorways.
Take a look at this.
Tell me you saw that.
Saw what?
The face. It just flashed
across the screen.
No.
You didn't hear any of those sounds?
I heard nothing.
These sounds,
the static, the children's voices,
the wet thumping,
I keep hearing them.
I'm going out of my fucking mind!
No, you're not.
The painter in this video could
be sending you messages.
Perhaps he knows your gift.
My "gift"?
Those hunches you get,
what your partner calls your radar,
we call it "the
Discernment of Spirits."
You can sense what others can't.
It is a spiritual gift,
but it also puts you at risk.
It makes you a target.
Those Latin messages
weren't written in paint.
They were written in human blood.
We ran a DNA test, searched
the database and got a match.
Santino's got a police record?
Arrested for violent
assault two years ago
when he was home between deployments.
Acquitted and arrest record expunged
when the victim disappeared.
But his DNA sample was
in the felony database
along with a recent address.
Holy shit.
Right here in the South Bronx.
I'll see the judge about the warrant.
Hey!
No landlord around, no key.
Want to kick it in? Go in strong?
Please?
You wait out front.
I'll take the back.
We'll pop him when he shows.
He said he'd be there.
I know. Daddy's got a lot to do.
I'm gonna run your bath,
then it's time for bed, okay?
Mommy!
Christina!
- Mommy!
- Christina!
Christina!
Mommy!
Christina. What's wrong?
I heard scratching again,
and the door wouldn't open!
You're okay. Shh.
Baby.
Oh.
Do you have a crucifix in your home?
We're Italian. What do you think?
Good.
That's a start.
If you have been
called into the Work,
you and your family
are already in danger.
And now listen to me.
I can't help you any further
unless you humble
yourself before God.
What do you mean,
like a confession? Like in church?
We don't need a church.
We can do it right here.
You can call it confession,
admission, coming clean,
therapy, whatever.
Jesus.
This is spiritual evil you're
dealing with, Sarchie.
You cannot fight it in the usual way.
Whatever your sins are,
you need to face them now,
because they will be
used against you.
I guarantee you that.
I don't know, Father.
I can't do that.
Do you remember that
tape I played you?
Claudia, the woman from Venezuela.
How could I forget?
The night you and I first met,
I went to Claudia's house for
the first time in many years.
After seeing Jane Crenna that night,
I needed to see Claudia again.
To remind myself that an
encounter with true evil
can always bring out the evil in me.
What do you mean?
Less than a year after the ritual
cleansing I did at Claudia's house,
she and I relapsed together.
- No shit?
- Yeah.
Several times a week, for months.
No pain, no anguish,
no anxiety. Total euphoria.
And then when we
came down, we'd have sex.
She got pregnant.
And against my best efforts,
she had an abortion.
Jesus.
You're no saint, Father.
I'll give you that.
Funny you should say that.
Because when I couldn't
take the guilt anymore,
I confessed what I'd done.
And of course I assumed
I would be defrocked.
I certainly deserved to be.
But you know what my
parish priest told me?
He said,
"A saint is not a moral exemplar.
"A saint is a life-giver."
He heard my full story,
told me that if it happened
again I would be defrocked,
and I left his office committed
to walking the path of grace.
So I do know how difficult it is.
But you need to unburden
yourself, Sarchie.
You need to deal with
that hidden pain.
It's killing you inside.
Holy shit, there he is.
He's approaching the building.
I'll meet you around the back.
We'll go in through the side.
Stay in the car.
Sarchie.
Don't be deceived by his tricks.
He's not here.
What is it? What's wrong?
You don't hear nothing?
No.
Do you hear something?
Radar.
Sarch, that's just the alarm.
Son of a bitch!
Radio the floor he stops on!
Basement, he's in the basement!
No, please,
help me.
Help me.
Okay, push.
Are you fucking kidding me?
It's stuck, man.
No!
God damn it!
As a cop,
I've always had a pretty heavy hand.
Where's Butler?
I don't know.
Shit.
Butler?
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Repeat, officer down!
- Attention all units.
- Butler?
I repeat, officer down.
Address is 144 and Rider.
Repeat, 144 and Rider.
If I'd gotten there sooner,
he'd still be here.
You know that's not your fault.
What else?
I've neglected my wife and
daughter for years now.
Shut them out.
I put the job first.
I understand.
As a cop,
I've always had a pretty heavy hand.
Go on.
Oh.
I killed a man, Father.
Marvin,
the one Jane Crenna
mentioned back in her cell.
Yes.
Was he a good man?
No. He was the worst
kind of man there is.
Folks, listen up.
This is Marvin Scrimm.
He's wanted on 11 counts
of child sexual assault,
and now, two counts of child murder.
Let's get this guy off the street.
He was everything I hate.
And I feed off that hate.
She was six years old.
Same age Christina is now.
My blood ran ice cold.
Marvin, the sick fuck,
he came back to have a second look.
And that's when I saw him.
I had him under control.
But I couldn't stop the rage.
I was like an animal.
I couldn't stop myself.
I didn't want to stop.
No, please,
help me.
Help me.
I just kept hitting him.
Over, and over,
and over.
Even after he was dead.
And ever since that night,
I've had a darkness growing inside
of me like a fucking cancer.
I can't control my anger.
I can't talk to Jen. I just...
Wrath.
Are you certain the guy
you killed was guilty?
Yeah.
His DNA was on all the victims.
I've tried telling myself
he deserved to die.
But if that's true,
why does this eat away
at me every goddamn day?
Because even if he got
what he deserved,
what you gave him wasn't justice.
It was vengeance.
And vengeance always
destroys the avenger.
I absolve you from your sins.
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
Mommy.
This is Sergeant Ralph Sarchie.
I need a bus and an 85 forthwith
at Valentine and East Tremont.
I have a jumper.
Female.
Her name is Jane Crenna.
Jen?
Jen, are you there? You okay?
It was me.
It was me who made her jump.
Santino?
Are you in my house?
I need help.
My house. Now.
Get down!
Get down on the ground right now,
or I'll fucking shoot you!
- Jen! Christina!
- They're not here.
They'll die if you don't find them.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Tell me where the fuck they are.
Let us in.
Let us in, and we'll tell you.
Let me in. It's the only
way you'll find them.
Do it.
Do it. Go on. Do it. Do it. Do it.
Fucking do it!
If you won't let me in...
then your family dies.
And so will you!
Sarchie! Sarch!
Go, go, go!
Put him on the ground!
Grab his arms.
Hold still! Hold still!
Get his legs!
Where are my wife and daughter?
Where is my family?
Fucking cat!
Get him!
Put him down. Put him down.
This guy's not human!
No.
- Get his arms.
- Put your arms down.
Get him! Put them down!
Put them down!
Leave us alone.
I'll take full responsibility.
Can't do that, Sarch.
Do it.
Go.
We need to perform a full
ritual exorcism on this man,
but we need time to prepare.
We don't have the time. I need
him to tell me where my family is.
Leave me alone with him.
I can't do that, Father.
Not while he's under arrest.
Do what you got to do.
Don't worry about me. I'll help you.
All right.
We'll perform the exorcism now.
Get the fuck out of here.
Read the responses only.
There are six stages to exorcism.
Presence, Pretense, Breakpoint,
Voice, Clash and Expulsion.
During each stage, you will do
exactly as I say and nothing else.
Don't talk to it. Don't listen to it.
Just read and pray.
Do you understand?
Yeah, I got it.
"Is everybody in? Is everybody in?
"Is everybody in?
"The ceremony is about to begin."
Yes. Let's begin.
"Glorious prince of
the Heavenly Host,
"Saint Michael the Archangel,
"defend us now in this conflict
"against the rulers of
this world of darkness,
"against the spirits of
wickedness in high places!"
"Come to the rescue of men,
whom God has created in His likeness,
"and has redeemed from
the tyranny of evil."
"I rebuke thee, devil!"
"In the name of Dominus, depart."
"The Lord be with you."
"And also with, with you."
What you're feeling is the
Presence, the first stage.
It's a deep psychological terror.
Don't give in to it.
It will pass in a moment.
"Let God arise! And let
his enemies be banished!
"And let them that hate Him
flee before his face!"
"As wax melteth before the fire,
"so let the wicked perish
at the presence of God!"
Are you okay? Can you continue?
I... Yes...
What's happening?
Who are you people?
What am I doing here?
Is that it? Is it over?
No. This is the Pretense.
The demon is trying to hide behind
the personality of the possessed.
"In the name of Jesus, we refuse and
rebuke this evil sent against us."
"O Father in Heaven, so be it."
Tell me your name, demon.
God knows your name!
Knows your number!
His mark is upon you!
God beckons you to depart!
Now! Now! Now! Now!
Oh, my fuck.
This is the Breakpoint.
What does that mean?
We're about to hear the Voice.
Your name, demon. Tell me your name.
Jane Crenna... Mendoza.
Is Jane Crenna dead?
Is Jane Crenna dead?
I killed Jane, just like I'm
going to kill your son.
You have a son.
Claudia kept the baby.
No.
He too will be mine.
You liar. You're a liar.
You're a liar!
You're a fucking liar! No!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Listen to me! Stop! Stop!
Listen! I don't know what
he just said to you,
but you're doing exactly
what you told me not to do!
You're talking to it! Stop! Focus.
You hear me? Focus.
By the authority of our Lord,
and in His holy name,
I command you, demon...
I brought it out of you,
didn't I, Priest?
Silence.
I brought out the beast.
Silence. Silence.
I command you to tell
me what I shall call you.
Your name, demon?
Jungler, Jungler, Jungler.
What is it?
You didn't hear that?
My name is the Jungler.
Do you hear the Voice?
Is it giving you a name? What is it?
- What is it?
- Says it's called...
- Jungler.
- "Jungler."
Jungler! You have been vanquished
by the blood of Christ!
And by the authority of that blood,
I command you to depart
this servant of God!
Desist, Jungler! You know your peril
is imminent, and your end is near!
Desist! Desist! Desist!
Get ready.
For fucking what?
The fifth stage, the Clash.
What is it?
Music!
"By the precious blood of Christ,
"we command you to depart and
go where the Lord sends you!"
Hold him down!
"Holy Cross, be my light,
let not the dragon be my guide."
Be gone, demon!
By the authority of Christ,
and by His power alone,
I cast you out!
I cast you out! I cast you out!
I cast you out!
That's Expulsion. The beast is gone.
The beast is gone.
Tell me, please, where are they?
Hey. What child is presented in
this home today for holy baptism?
Daniella Ann Sarchie.
And who presents this
child to be baptized?
Jennifer and Ralph Sarchie.
Ralph Sarchie, do you renounce
Satan and all of his works?
I do renounce him.
All his works, and all his ways.
I renounce all evil.
Break on through
to the other side, yeah
But can you still recall
the time we cried?
