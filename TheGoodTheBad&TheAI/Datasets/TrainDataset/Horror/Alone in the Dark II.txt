Easy.
Okay. Come on.
Cool off.
Take some breaths here.
It's your responsibility now.
Just you.
The signal stopped.
Hey, listen.
We got about a half hour
till daylight.
We can make it.
Come on. Let's go.
Get up.
You've got to focus.
You don't stand a chance
against it,
not out here.
Not out here,
but maybe in there.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.
Attaboy.
Got him?
Yeah.
You got him?
¶
Now he says we only gotta
take the baggies once.
Fuckin'- Aw, shit.
Shit! Stupid hippies.
Next time,
I use Puerto Ricans.
Swish.
Come on. Come on!
Shit.
Put him over there.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah.
She's not getting it, Doug.
Not tonight, she's not.
That's it. That's it!
Getting closer.
Burn it.
Burn it!
Nothing must remain.
Getting closer!
We're gonna make it. Right?
Maybe you could shoot me.
She might leave you alone.
Wouldn't do any good.
She's got it, too.
How far?
Showtime, people.
I can feel her.
Fire! Fire!
No! No! No!
You Carnby?
Edward Carnby?
Maybe.
How'd you get the number?
Shep gave it to me.
He says you
can help me out.
You know stuff
about the occult-
ghosts and shit.
That's delicate stuff,
and it don't come cheap.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
He said you'd get us
into the coroner's office.
So I can see the bodies.
He tell you this?
Shep says a lot of things,
and most of them
don't make any sense.
But he did mention something
to me about a dagger.
A little black dagger
about this big.
I might be
interested in that.
What's wrong
with you, man?
You were there when
those three people
got butchered,
and now you wanna see
their dead bodies?
The dagger, Xavier.
You want my help?
I need to see it.
Carnby, come on.
Make sure nobody's coming.
Xavier, come on.
What, are you scared?
How'd you know
how to get in here?
It's not about how.
It's about how much.
Keep your mouth shut.
It looks like
it exploded.
She's got it, too.
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?
Aah, fuck.
Geez, she touched the dagger.
These lines-
they work their way
through your body.
Then they try
to control you.
It reacts to light.
Yeah.
It re- It-
Hey.
What's wrong with you?
I can't control it anymore!
How long have you
had this for?
Since I touched
the dagger.
It started in my hand,
and it's-
it's all through my body.
The dagger's real.
Take it.
Just be careful.
Don't cut yourself.
Yeah.
I thought that
was cool at first, too.
It's the lines.
A witch's mark.
When you first
touch the dagger,
there's a burning feeling.
It's light at first,
but it builds.
She gets-
I've had these dreams
in my head,
and I can hear
her voice all the time.
If you don't do
what she says,
she comes
and does it for you,
like she did with them.
Who?
The witch.
The witch that dagger
belongs to.
You said something
about a map
that one of them
carved into himself.
That one.
"K, E," and some lines.
We have to find the right map
so we'll know the location.
She's coming.
Is there another way
to get out of here?
You know how much power
that dagger has?
How it works?
So it was hidden in here?
I can feel her.
Hey, are you sure
that they didn't take
what was placed in the dagger
and place it somewhere else?
Do you want power?
More power than
you've ever imagined?
What price
you want to pay, Carnby?
What are you willing
to pay?
You belong to her now.
I did it!
I did what you wanted!
I did what you wanted!
Where is the dagger?
Hey! Where's the dagger?
It's here.
He stabbed him with it.
The signal's getting closer.
We have to go.
We're gonna have to
take him with us.
It's too late.
The signal's already in range.
She's coming
for our friend here.
He's lit up
like a Christmas tree.
It's the only chance we have.
This is the best
I can do for you, pal.
No change.
And this one?
His wound is too fresh.
She can't see him yet.
No change.
Wait! No more signal.
The knife has started
to dissolve.
Pack up.
We're taking him with us.
No...
If he puts us in any danger,
I'll shoot him.
I think it's starting.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Ask him what he sees.
It's that piece of blade.
It's killing him.
He won't make it.
Pull over.
Pull over!
Got him?
Faster!
Here. I'll do it, Dad.
Who are you?
Hold him down!
Damn it!
Where is the dagger?
You think you can
get it out?
Okay, let's get him
from the street.
Come on!
Is it over?
It's just starting.
I can't get
this damn thing to work.
Dad, he's awake.
Ah, okay.
Well, keep trying.
All right. All right.
Keep trying.
How's he doing?
How do you feel?
Where am I?
With friends.
Now listen up, Carnby.
That's your name,
right?
Now,
you've been stabbed.
As a result,
you're gonna see things-
visions, dreams.
Now, we need to know
exactly what you see,
and in particular,
we need to know the location.
Now, you can either
work with us,
or you'll end up
a dead man.
I need a phone.
Whatever happens,
don't ever look into
the mirror in your dreams.
If you
look into the mirror,
the enemy will know
where we are.
If this happens,
Boyle here will shoot you.
Welcome to my house.
Let me go.
We're doing this
to save your life.
I promise.
The blade has deteriorated.
It was in his body too long.
What worries me even more
is that the reliquiaes
that were inside it
are missing.
He needs somebody
who knows how to deal
with that kind of wound.
We can't take him
to a hospital.
It's not a normal wound.
No, I'm not talking
about a hospital.
I'm talking about someone
who knows
what's involved here.
If anybody can help him,
Abner can.
I told you never to mention
his name again!
Now, let me
tell you something.
Carnby will be dead
and gone
long before I ever
invite Abner Lundberg
to set foot
in this house again.
Now, your grandfather
made his biggest mistake
in getting involved
with him.
I will not make
that same mistake.
What about
the vision of yours?
Do you really feel
them coming?
Who are you?
Come to me.
Carnby!
Where is he?
He's gone.
He got my weapon.
Carnby!
Carnby.
He's over here.
We're losing him.
Is he looking
into a mirror?
I know who you are.
You're not gonna shoot him.
You shoot him
when I tell you to shoot him.
What about us?
Go get the syringe.
Look at me. Look at me.
Right in the heart?
I have to find
the right ventricle.
She's looking
through his eyes!
Now!
I can see you.
I know who you are.
I know who you are.
Huh?
Are we on time?
Looks like.
Go see Abner.
He'll come.
You looked
in the mirror.
I know you did.
You saw her.
You're putting us
all in danger.
No matter what you do,
the witch will come for you.
Yeah, I know.
She's after the dagger.
What did you see?
I saw a woman in a lab.
A man was there
torturing her.
Where is the dagger?
He dug a grave for her
in the middle of the room.
She was supposed to be killed,
wasn't she?
But something went wrong.
What you're seeing
happened many years ago.
That man was my father.
Look for hints
to the location of the lab.
Why?
Because that's the only place
it will stop.
We're fetching someone
who can help you.
Why are you
doing all this?
She isn't after you yet.
Some things
are worse than death.
She wants my daughter.
That's why the witch
has returned.
If you're looking
for the clinic,
it's closed today.
Mr. Lundberg.
Mr. Abner Lundberg?
Uh-huh.
I'm Natalie Dexter.
Do you remember me?
Please sit.
I hear you never
wanted anything to do
with your father's
hocus-pocus.
She's back.
She is, huh?
And it's worse
than ever.
Well, it's none of my business.
I did what I could.
I have
a different life now.
We need your help.
Do you really think
you could resist her?
She destroyed
your grandfather.
She will destroy
your whole family
and everyone
you've ever known.
I have the mark.
She wants me.
Just like my mother.
There's something about
the Dexters that attracts her.
Oh, yeah.
How long
have you had this?
For three weeks.
I went to the doctor
at first,
but then the dreams started.
Why didn't you
go to your father?
You just expect me
to sit around
and wait for her
to come get me?
Listen to me.
She was after your grandfather,
the Dexters.
It was revenge.
He was the one
that hunted her down.
Wow.
I felt that vibe.
No. Don't touch it.
After all these years,
I'm immune to witchcraft crap.
It's real.
There's a piece of the heart
missing from the inside.
Looks like this blade
has been used.
We have someone
who was injured by it.
And they're still alive?
He is.
Did they find
the hag's grave?
No. And he doesn't have
much time.
We need your help.
Well,
if we'd only had this
in the day.
My grandfather told you things
that he never told my father.
You were his friend.
What?
Hank Willis is on the phone.
His cow died after she took
the medicine you gave her.
He wants his money back.
He does, huh?
You tell him
I gave him a remedy.
I told him no food,
just water.
Tell him to go to hell.
Leave us.
You stay.
It's gonna be all right.
I'm gonna take care of you.
He's got slivers
in his wounds.
This dries them.
Hold it right on there
and press it.
Harder. Harder.
There you go. Okay.
This is making you visible
to the other side.
You're glowing like
a thousand-watt bulb.
What's that?
It's for you.
You got yourself
involved in something
that's way beyond
your abilities,
I'll tell you that much.
This dagger-
a very amazing weapon.
It's made of amostite.
Very valuable.
Did you want it
for the blade
or what it could do?
Rumors and myths.
You want to buy
eternal life
with the deaths
of others?
You're
fighting a witch
that's hundreds of years old.
She has the knowledge
and the ability
far beyond anything
we've ever known.
She can slip- insert her soul
into another body.
She solved the riddle
of immortality.
You can't move
while I'm doing this.
This is
a radioactive solution.
Hold on.
Right there. Right...
Yeah. There.
It makes you invisible
to the other side.
It cancels out the aura.
If your hair
falls out tomorrow,
then it was too strong.
He'll sleep.
He'll sleep now.
Your boyfriend is gonna
get us in a lot of trouble.
He's not my boyfriend.
Really?
I suggest
you keep it that way.
He's an idealist.
They're the worst.
I know.
I was one once myself.
That dagger shouldn't
cause any serious injury.
It kills the soul,
not the body.
We're on the verge of finding
the witch's lair.
Thought you might
be interested.
After all, you spent
a lot of time looking for it.
Whatever you find
will have been dead
long ago.
Do you still have those things
my father gave you?
They wouldn't be
of any use to you.
Do you still have them?
I burned them years ago.
I've made my peace
with the occult.
I don't bother it,
it doesn't bother me.
They're all dead,
you know.
Everyone that worked
with your father,
they're all dead.
They tried to do good,
and they end up doing evil.
You're gonna mess
this thing up, baby.
The great Abner Lundberg
is afraid.
You know, a lot of people
died around you back then,
and it didn't seem
to bother you.
Oh, no?
You were
my father's favorite.
If your father
could see you now,
he'd laugh.
You nauseated me then,
and you nauseate me now.
He's got two days,
maybe three.
Or, just maybe,
the hag will come
and take him tonight.
I'd rather not be here
if she does.
Don't touch.
You're reading
the EM frequencies?
We're looking
for specific patterns.
Our witch broadcast
a bunch of them.
Any readings?
Should there be?
Don't worry. We've got
a few surprises for her.
She's already here!
Oh, shit!
Okay, everybody, upstairs.
Carnby, come on!
A whole panic room?
Carnby, get in here!
Come on!
Okay, everybody,
stay away from the wires.
Put in the UV.
Can you turn off
that alarm, please?
The lights won't
hold her forever.
This isn't the first time
we've had company here.
What the hell was that?
Is she already
in the house?
She's on the roof.
Carnby, is she already
in the house?
No.
She's not here because of me.
She wants the dagger.
But you can't
go down there now.
The two of us will go.
My kind of mission.
Good luck.
Hey. Not you.
I can feel her presence.
Can you?
We gotta get back upstairs.
What's going on?
She can't get in here.
Not with this light.
Don't move.
The generator should
come on in a second.
There's something there!
Come on!
She's coming!
Fire!
Carnby, you're no good
to us down here.
It's your responsibility.
Let's go
fix that generator.
Okay, go slow.
She responds to movement.
Come on, baby.
Come on!
I'm not waiting any longer.
Oh, God.
Natalie, wait.
Natalie.
God.
You can't use the weapon.
What?
It's the tracer bullets.
Dexter. Dexter!
Trust me.
How did you do that?
Daddy!
Don't come any closer!
Don't do it!
You know what to do.
No!
She's waited
a long time for this.
No!
Your father
was a good man.
She's coming back
tonight, isn't she?
She'll find us,
no matter where we are.
You're gonna be safe.
I'm sorry about what happened
to your father, Natalie.
I'm sure he had some idea
how it might play out.
Everyone
has to die in the end.
The dagger's incomplete.
You know what's missing.
What's driving the dagger
is weak-
too weak to have any effect.
We need a piece
of the witch's heart
to reactivate it.
Everything you need
you'll find in the witch's lab.
I've washed my hand of her.
My grandfather trusted you.
If he found anything out,
he must've
told you about it.
What do you know about
your grandfather, Natalie?
He fought against the witch,
just like you.
He didn't fight
against the witch.
Your grandfather
fought for her,
and ultimately ended up
killing for her.
Why don't you cut
the crap, Lundberg?
No, no.
Please,
I'm telling the truth.
He was obsessed
with the occult.
You know, she needed
another vessel,
and at that same moment,
your mother was becoming
less and less tolerant
with your grandfather's
insane ideas.
A daughter-in-law
was now becoming bothersome.
Your mother became the bait.
Just the bait.
Just another sacrifice
he had to make
to find out
about more secrets,
and her body
was the witch's asking price.
You didn't know
your grandfather.
You don't remember him.
Your grandfather gave up
fighting for good
a long time ago.
All he wanted was these
secrets of eternal life
at all costs.
His reward for a piece
of your mother's heart...
was a few seductive secrets.
And then she demanded more.
She demanded another body.
You were 3 years old,
Natalie.
He told her that...
when you reached
the right age,
he would give you
to the witch.
Your grandfather sold you,
and now she intends
to come and collect.
This is all I have
from the good old days.
There has to be another box-
a green Army crate
with a red cross on it.
This is everything.
How much of your soul
have you already sold, Carnby?
Hmm?
I would never kill anyone
just to learn a few secrets.
Sure you would.
And I know who I am.
But this isn't about
just me anymore.
You know, you're an idealist.
People have to be careful
that they don't get damaged
from your mistakes.
Oh.
Such an old man.
This is hopeless,
by the way.
And he left
only vague references
to where
this place might be.
What are
these letters here?
We cut this whole thing
into quadrants.
I've looked for this thing.
I've searched for years
and never found it.
K, E. K, E.
This was Kevin's quadrant.
It was in the north
of the park.
It could be in the park.
It could be near the park.
What is that?
KE-12.
It's right here.
Wow.
Where's Natalie?
Oh, my God.
Natalie!
She's materializing
during the day!
Natalie!
Martha, where's my gun?
Throw the dagger!
Natalie, throw the dagger!
Out of my way.
It's not the gun!
It's the bullets!
Throw the dagger now!
Throw it!
Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!
Are you okay?
I saw her.
Not like in the cellar.
I saw her face.
You feeling better?
I'll be fine.
You might need this.
If you find that witch's lab,
be careful.
She'll have all kinds of traps
and other measures.
You know, really.
If her remains
are buried there,
we'll find them.
Are you sure it's here?
It's right here.
Okay.
We shouldn't be here
when it gets dark.
The lab has to be
in direct contact
with the ground.
Are you okay?
It has to be here.
The others
couldn't sense it.
That's why they weren't
able to find it.
What is this?
We're below
the foundation.
It's here.
There's no way in.
Maybe we can pry it open.
I'm going in.
Wait a minute.
I'm the only one
who can fit.
Well?
There's some kind
of mechanism in here.
Watch your step.
We have to get out of here
before it gets dark outside.
Let me get something.
Where's the dagger?
Come on.
Show me the way.
Give it to me, Natalie.
Bring me the dagger.
Come on.
Be a good girl.
Give me the dagger.
No!
"Don't step
on the red buttons. "
Natalie.
Wait.
I'm getting a jack
from the car.
It's getting dark.
Shit!
She's coming!
Are you okay?
She can't get in here,
can she?
It's her lab.
Let's do it.
Buried alive.
Witches' ultimate revenge.
It's a message
for Abner.
It's in code.
He used a straightforward
encryption.
It's not difficult.
She's trying to get in.
Wait here.
Sorry.
My grandfather wanted to bury
the witch here in her lab,
but I don't see
a grave anywhere.
Because there isn't one.
It was never here.
The foundation shift
did it.
Roll up your sleeve.
Save that for later.
It's getting worse.
You might not have a later.
We have to get out
of here first.
The sewers are back there.
The lab isn't
sealed off anymore.
She can get in.
Where's the dagger?
It's starting.
Edward, she's coming!
The torch is acting up.
Natalie, let's go.
Hurry.
We have to keep moving.
I don't think
she wanted us here.
It was here.
You need the dagger
to open the wall.
That's why
she couldn't escape.
Hey, come here.
You okay?
It's started.
You belong to her now.
She has a claim on you,
and you're here to collect.
This isn't you, Edward.
You can fight against it.
You should know
someone always has to die.
Well, it's not gonna be me.
Natalie.
Natalie!
Without the witch,
that thing's useless.
I told her my code
was too easy to crack.
It's not
"Kill the witch. "
It's "Free the witch. "
"Kill Natalie. "
This is not Natalie.
Oh, shit!
Watch her!
Where's Natalie?
Where's the dagger?
Don't give it to her!
Ow! Damn!
I'll kill him first,
and then I'll take care
of your little girlfriend.
She's still in here
somewhere.
How long can you stay
in the body for?
One minute? Two?
You know the heart
must be pierced.
This is what you want.
I can sense you're dying
to see how the ritual works.
Forget about the girl.
I can give you knowledge
beyond your wildest dreams.
We can do things together
she'd never do.
Do it!
Do it.
You foolish man.
We could've had a lot of fun.
I would've retrieved it
before it dissolved.
Don't stop till she's dead.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Natalie had to die
to destroy the witch.
Her old son of a bitch
grandfather knew that.
He knew it.
What are you doing?
She's already dead,
isn't she?
No, no. Listen to me.
Wait, wait. Wait.
Use the blade.
Use the dagger.
Come on!
Use the dagger. Yeah.
Use the dagger.
Come on!
Trust me. Come on.
Please.
I swear to God
it won't hurt her.
Use it.
It kills the soul,
not the body.
Trust me.
Trust me. Trust me.
Yes.
Oh!
Oh!
Don't ever do that again.
Yeah, I got it.
I got it.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
