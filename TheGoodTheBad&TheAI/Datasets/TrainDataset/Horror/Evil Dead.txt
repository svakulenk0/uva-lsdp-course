Shh! Shh!
We caught the bitch.
Please don't hurt me.
Don't be afraid, girl.
Who are you?
Somebody please help me.
Only the evil book can undo
what the evil book has done.
Please.
I just want to go home.
Please.
I just want to go home.
Daddy?
Daddy, why are you
doing this to me?
Who are these people?
MAN: Look, they are
good people.
They are here to help.
What are you
talking about?
Where's Mom?
Mommy is dead, baby.
You know that.
You killed her.
What?
You did.
No, why are you
saying these things?
Please, I just want go home.
I just want to go home.
Do it! It's the only way
to save her soul!
I'm so sorry, baby.
Daddy, what is that?
Daddy.
Daddy, look at me.
It's me.
Do it!
Give your daughter peace!
I just want you to hold
me and take me home.
Please.
Please stop.
I will rip your
soul out, Daddy.
I'll rip your soul out,
you pathetic fuck!
Motherfucker!
I will kill you
like I killed...
your whore!
Fuck!
Fuck!
I love you, baby.
OLIVIA: Hey.
How's it going,
Mr. Hot Shit City Boy?
Hey, Olivia.
Come here.
Two arms, please.
Like you missed me.
OLIVIA: Mmm.
This is my girl Natalie.
Oh, the heartbreaker
from your car shop.
The doctor?
DAVID:
Actually, she's...
I'm a registered nurse.
Nurse.
Mmm-hmm.
Right, sorry.
You were supposed to be
here two hours ago, man.
And that's our
irresistibly charming Eric.
Teaching high school finally turned
you into a bitter old coot, huh?
No, you did.
You kept us waiting here
all morning.
Good to see you too, man.
Come here.
You look good.
She's waiting for you
in the back.
Great.
Hey, Mia.
I'll be damned.
You actually came.
Come on,
I'm your big brother.
Of course I came.
I know I
look like road kill.
Oh, you look beautiful,
as always.
And you're a charming
liar, as always.
Grandpa?
Hey.
Hey, there buddy.
We always loved this
place, didn't we?
He missed you a lot,
you know.
Oh, my God.
What?
What is that?
What?
Just this, right here.
It's not funny!
This is made from
a buckthorn tree.
It's supposed to
make your will stronger.
I thought you didn't
believe in that kind of stuff.
I don't. But you do,
so, maybe it'll work.
Okay.
Well, then, let's do this.
Promise me you'll stay
with me until the end.
I'm not going anywhere.
Cross your heart.
Okay.
Hope to die.
Okay.
May my friends and family
witness this act...
an irrevocable promise
to my commitment that...
Fuck it.
I promise not to
touch this shit...
ever again.
Okay.
Let's play cold turkey.
DAVID: Hopefully,
this still works.
Wait.
Looks like
someone broke in.
NATALIE: Be careful.
What is that smell?
ERIC: Some teenagers probably just broke
in here to drink beer and bump uglies.
OLIVIA: Exactly.
Mom would have hated
seeing the cabin like this.
Okay.
Let's make
this place livable.
DAVID: Hey.
Are you okay?
MIA: Do you remember that
lullaby Mom used to sing us?
It was something like...
"Baby, little baby,
it's time to say goodbye."
"Baby, little baby..."
Mia, please,
I don't think you need
sad memories in
your head right now.
Mom is not a sad one.
You know what I mean.
You know what? Her final
days at the hospital...
Mom sometimes
thought I was you.
She even called me David
for a whole day, once.
And I played along,
because...
Mia, I wanted to be there.
Okay, I did.
But by the time
Mom got bad...
I had just gotten the job
at the garage in Chicago.
I don't know, I had a hard time finding
the right moment to come back.
And then it was
too late. So...
Maybe you were lucky, not to
see her the way that I did.
It looks like
she is doing okay.
David, there is something
you need to know.
Okay.
We already tried
this whole thing
back in Flint last summer.
Mia made
the same promises.
She took the same
dramatic vow of sobriety
before chucking her
dope down the toilet.
She lasted eight hours
and quit.
So, we don't want to
give her that chance
this time.
What do you mean?
David, when she breaks...
and believe me, she will...
we don't want
to let her leave.
What do you mean? You want
force her to stay here?
Mia?
This time the only way
is the hard way, man.
She won't survive another OD.
What?
Mia OD'd?
She didn't just OD.
Legally, your sister died.
They had to
defibrillate her.
Jesus.
We all need to be together on this.
Otherwise it won't work.
Good boy.
I came here to make things
better with my sister,
not worse.
If she asks me to
take her home at some point
I'm going to
have to do it.
MIA: I can't stand it!
Fuck!
I can't stand it!
What the fuck
is that smell?
OLIVIA: I know.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I can't stand that
fucking smell anymore.
Lie down, okay?
We're here for you.
I know, I know.
We're all here.
We're not going anywhere.
OLIVIA: Withdrawal is
kicking in hard.
This should help you
get through the night.
I don't know what
is wrong with you people...
but there is something
dead and it reeks.
But there is no smell.
You're just
extra-sensitive right now.
I just can't stand that
fucking smell anymore.
Wait.
Oh, is that blood?
Shit. Oh...
MIA: What's your
medical diagnosis now?
OLIVIA:
It fucking stinks.
DAVID: Shit. Careful.
These steps are
old and rotten.
ERIC: Yeah, like this
whole freaking house.
I know.
Ugh!
It smells like
burnt hair.
I think it's back there.
DAVID: Oh!
Ugh!
ERIC: Oh, my God!
Shit.
DAVID: What is this?
I don't know.
Witchcraft?
Who would do this?
Shit, something
burned here.
Look.
Shit, man.
What the fuck
happened here?
Let's not go crazy
over this. Okay?
I'll bury those dead cats
out back later.
Yeah. The smell will
be gone in no time.
Yeah, okay.
And what about the voodoo
shit they did down there?
No, no,no. Voodoo is more about
dolls and personal artifacts.
This is
something different.
Eric, that's enough.
You shouldn't have touched
anything from that basement.
"Naturom Demonto."
"Kunda."
"Astratta."
"Montosse."
"Canda."
Please, God,
give me a break.
Mia.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry, but I have to
get out of here right now.
No, come on. The slumber
party isn't over yet.
Yeah, we still haven't played
"Fuck, Marry, Kill," right?
Mia, please look...
I'm going insane here.
Olivia, I feel like
I'm losing my mind.
DAVID: What is it?
I will go through
with this, okay?
I just...
I can't do it here.
Mia...
we have decided we're
not going to take you back.
ERIC:
We can't lose you again.
You're going to have to
stick it out this time.
David, drive me home.
Come on, David.
Mia, maybe they're right.
You were supposed to be here
to support me, not them.
I'm here for you.
That's why I came.
Oh, my God.
I'm such an idiot.
To think for
once in my life...
I could count on you.
Mia, we're just
trying to help you.
Well, fuck you very much!
Eric, leave her alone.
Mia.
Mia!
Perfect.
Fuck this. Fuck, fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck!
What the fuck am I doing?
What the fuck am I doing?
DAVID: Mia!
OLIVIA: Mia!
DAVID: Mia!
Mia.
DEMON: Mia!
DEMON: Mia.
DAVID: Mia!
OLIVIA: Mia!
Mia!
Mia!
Shit.
Oh, my God.
Hey, how's she doing?
Um, she's talking about
a woman in the woods.
How the forest
attacked her.
I don't know. It's just
crazy withdrawal talk.
Don't you think we should
take her to a hospital?
I feel like we're in
over our heads here.
Okay. I am giving her
the exact same treatment
she would get
at a hospital.
If we leave now, all of this
mess will have been for nothing.
Okay. What about
the wounds on her arms?
I pulled
some thorns out.
It looks like she might have run
into a thorn bush out there.
She probably
did it on purpose.
What?
David...
from now on,
she is going to do
whatever it takes
to get out of here.
Mia.
Listen, you have to
get out of those clothes.
All right?
Take a shower.
David.
Please.
Please.
You have to get me...
out of here.
Nobody said this
was going to be easy.
No.
You don't understand.
There was something
in the woods, David.
And I think it's in
here with us now.
With me in the room?
Look. You know
it's all in your head.
Just try to
get it together.
You'll feel better
tomorrow, okay?
You'll be glad
we were such assholes.
Okay.
Eric, what are you doing?
Would you please just
get rid of that thing?
You should be downstairs helping
your friend clean up that mess.
I don't know who
you're talking about.
Don't act like you
don't care about him.
I know you do.
I think we can all agree
he hasn't cared about us
for the past
freaking century.
Well, he's here now.
Yeah.
Truly amazing.
Ugh.
Grandpa?
Grandpa!
Grandpa?
Come here, boy.
Fuck.
Grandpa.
No, no,no.
Hey, boy. Come here.
What did you get into?
Fuck.
What happened?
Mia?
NATALIE:
She's in the shower.
OLIVIA:
What happened? David?
Mia?
Mia, open the door.
Hey, Mia, open the door.
Open the door!
OLIVIA: David,
what are you doing?
OLIVIA: David, stop and
tell me what's going on.
DAVID: Mia, open
the fucking door!
Mia?
Mia, open
the fucking door!
OLIVIA: David!
David!
Stop it!
Mia!
Mia?
Mia?
Olivia!
OLIVIA: Holy shit!
Mia!
Shit.
This is insane.
Fuck. Where is it?
This can't be happening.
I gave her a sedative so she should
be out for a couple of hours.
But, fuck, her burns are serious.
Like, second, third degree.
This is so wrong.
Nobody could have known she
would do something so twisted!
No, you should have known!
We've been following your
lead since we got here.
We should have left
when Mia wanted to.
Baby, please! Let's not
lose our heads, okay?
With any luck, it will stop
raining in a couple of hours...
and we'll be able to cross
the creek in the morning,
and take her
to a hospital.
Okay? Everything
is going to be fine.
"Everything is
going to be fine"?
Everything is
going to be fine.
I don't know if you've noticed
this, but nothing has been fine.
And everything has been
getting worse every second.
Mia?
OLIVIA: Mia?
What are you doing?
Mia, put the gun down.
Put the gun down, please.
Mia.
Put the fucking gun down!
DEMON: Die!
One by one
we will take you!
DEMONIC VOICE: You are all
going to die tonight.
The gun.
The gun, quick!
Baby?
Mia!
MIA: Let me out!
She's totally psychotic.
My God,
what happened to her eyes?
What's she doing?
It sounds like she's hitting
herself against something.
This is impossible.
I just gave her enough sedative
to put a horse to sleep.
Give her another shot!
That could
put her into a coma.
For Christ's sakes, she's going
to kill herself down there!
Go get the shot!
I have to get the shrapnel
out of my arm.
What? I have tweezers
in my purse.
David. Listen to me.
I don't think a tranquilizer
is going to do shit.
Because I don't think we're dealing
with a freaking panic attack here!
I'm scared that what's happening
to Mia has something to do...
with the fucking witchcraft
in the basement!
Ow!
Olivia!
Olivia?
Olivia?
Are you okay?
Olivia?
Olivia,
what are you doing in there?
Olivia.
Olivia.
Are you okay?
Oh, my God!
Why the fuck
did you do that?
OLIVIA: Kill him.
No!
Ah!
ERIC: She tried to kill me.
She tried to kill me.
Fuck.
You hold that.
You got it?
Hold it there, okay?
Hold it.
Fuck it.
David,
I did something terrible.
I'm sure you
didn't mean to hurt her.
That thing I
killed was not Olivia.
He's losing
too much blood.
Baby, he needs water and sugar.
Okay?
Go.
Go!
Okay. Okay.
All right.
David.
I read a passage
from that book.
It was some
sort of prayer.
I released something, David.
I released something evil.
MIA: Natalie?
Mia?
MIA:  Natalie.
What am I doing
down here?
My leg hurts.
I can't move.
I'm going to come
down there, okay?
Why did you
lock me down here?
You were supposed to
help me.
Hey, we're trying
to help you, okay?
You were out of control,
you know?
You got violent and we
didn't know what else to do.
Mia, something really
terrible has happened...
and we have to
get out of here now.
You don't understand.
He's not going to
let you leave!
And he's not going to stop
until he has you.
Until he has all of you!
I can smell
your filthy soul.
Kiss me, you dirty cunt!
Why don't you come down here so I
can suck your cock, pretty boy!
Mia.
Mia's not here,
you fucking idiot!
Your little sister
is being raped in hell!
Home. I want to go home.
Eric.
ERIC: I don't know why, but I
thought this would end it.
But this book
does not burn.
It does not fucking burn.
Tell me what's
going on here.
ERIC:
This book uses some...
ancient alphabet.
There's some translations,
but...
Just scattered notes.
They all refer to some...
evil entity.
A taker of souls.
A demon.
It says...
"Once he feasts
on five souls...
"the sky will bleed again
and the abomination...
"will rise from Hell."
This is insane.
This thing is attached to
Mia's soul like a leech...
it's becoming her.
If we want to stop this,
if we want to help Mia...
I think we're going
to have to kill her.
What did you say?
Everything says...
Eric! We're not going to
fucking kill anybody!
Are you listening
to yourself?
What about those dead cats
down in the basement?
I mean, maybe they
had some disease.
Some virus that
spread to Mia...
and then she
passed it to Olivia
when she puked
all over her face!
But what kind of a virus
makes a person
cut off their face
with a piece of glass?
Oh, God.
I don't know what we're
dealing with here, okay?
But it stopped raining, and in a couple
of hours the river will be clear...
and we're going to get out of this place.
All of us.
It doesn't matter
where we go.
If we don't do
something right now...
we are all going
to be dead by then!
Don't do it, you little bitch!
Don't cut it off!
Don't cut it off!
FUCK you!
No, no,no!
No!
I had to do it.
And I feel much better now.
DAVID: Hold on, baby.
Hold on, please.
Eric and I are going to
put a stop to this, okay?
I promise that everything
is going to be fine.
Okay? Okay, baby?
She just cut her
fucking arm off.
Does that sound fine?
These inscriptions
are confusing,
sometimes contradictory...
but they are consistent
about one thing.
In order to stop this,
the possessed
must be cleansed.
Purified.
The book describes
three specific ways.
Alive burial.
Bodily dismemberment.
MAN: Dismemberment.
And purification by fire.
Are you sure
this will work?
If we...
If I kill my sister,
she will be at peace?
Am I sure?
Of course not.
This is not
a science book!
But look,
I'm sure of one thing.
Whatever is inside Mia
is the cause of all this.
If she dies, then this thing
is going to die with her.
What if she
just lost her mind?
What if she just
needs a doctor?
What? A doctor?
My mom died in
a mental hospital.
She was crazy.
She was deranged,
she was a monster.
I've always feared that
me and Mia would
end up like her.
You are just
a fucking coward.
You know exactly
what we have to do...
but you're too scared
to go through with it.
I'm going to burn
this fucking place down.
And I'm going to
end this nightmare.
Why don't you
just run away?
Go hide beneath
some rock somewhere.
You know you're
great at that.
ERIC: Oh, shit.
Where the fuck
did she go?
David.
Take it before she does.
ERIC: No!
Stop!
No, no,no!
David.
Why are you hurting me?
My face hurts.
Why?
Why...
Why does my face hurt?
Baby.
Nat.
Come on, man.
Here we are.
Hey. Hold on.
Don't die on me, please!
Dying wouldn't be
so bad right now.
I just don't want to
become the devil's bitch.
I'm going to do
what I got to do.
I'm going to do
what I got to do. Okay?
I'm sorry, Mia.
I love you.
MIA:
Baby, little baby
It's time to
say goodbye
Baby, little baby
I'll miss you
day and night
Baby, my sweet baby
I'll write you
every day
Baby, don't cry, baby
I wish that
I could stay
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
This time the only fucking
way is the hard way!
David.
Murderer.
Coward.
DAVID: Eric.
Hey. Okay?
David.
I missed you, man.
You know that, buddy.
David?
David?
I can't move!
I can't breathe!
David!
Help me!
Help me, David!
You're not her.
David!
Help me!
You're not her!
Why do you hate me, David?
I know you do.
You left home.
You left me all alone
with our sick mother.
And I was just a kid.
You made me lie.
Every time she
screamed your name,
I told her you were
coming to see her.
Like you promised.
But you never did.
Please stop it,
I'm begging you.
I know Mother
hates you now,
and she waits for you
in hell.
Shut up. Shut up.
I'm so sorry.
I should have been there.
I should have
been there for you.
Come on.
Please, come back.
Come on, Mia.
Come back to me, please!
Okay, you are at peace.
You are at peace now.
MIA: David?
Mia?
It was so horrible.
It was so horrible.
It's okay.
It's all over now.
Thanks for not
leaving me, David.
DAVID: Wait here. I'm going
to get the car keys.
Okay?
Yeah.
David!
Go. Please, go.
Go!
I'm not going to go anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere!
Here, take the keys.
Look at me, let's go.
Come on. Let's go.
Get out of here.
No! No!
David!
David!
MIA: No! No!
David! David!
He's coming.
Mia.
Come here, you bitch!
Come on.
You're going to die here,
you pathetic junkie!
I've had enough
of this shit.
I will feast on your soul.
Feast on this, motherfucker!
Die!
Go back to Hell, bitch.
PROFESSOR KNOWBY: I believe I
have made a significant find
in the Candarian Ruins...
a volume of ancient
Sumerian burial practices
and funerary incantations.
It is entitled
"Naturom Demonto."
Roughly translated,
"Book of the Dead."
The book is bound in human flesh
and inked in human blood.
It deals with demons,
demon resurrection...
those forces
which roam the forest
and dark bowers
of man's domain.
The first few pages warn that
these enduring creatures...
may lie dormant
but are never truly dead.
They may be recalled
to active life
through the incantations
presented in this book.
It is through recitation
of these passages
that the demons
are given license...
to possess the living.
I have seen the dark shadows
moving in the woods...
and I have no doubt that
whatever I have resurrected
through this book...
is sure to come
calling for me.
Groovy.
