- All right,
We are leaving the flatlands
and we are heading up
towards the mountain top,
which I'll show you right here.
Way up there.
I'm not sure who I'm meeting.
The ad said $1,000 for the day.
Filming services.
Discretion is appreciated,
whatever that means.
So, here's a thought:
What if this is just
some 40-something
who's sitting alone
in her apartment
waiting for some young
handsome boy to come up the hill
and give rubdowns, money,
and whisper sweet nothings?
It's just a thought.
Cute little lake.
Cute little town.
This is promising.
This is it.
A yellow door.
Okay.
Okay.
No answer and no voice-mail,
so that's good.
Hmm.
Okay, so...
I think it's smarter
if I wait in the car.
You know, just...
I don't think
this guy's showing up.
Which is too...
- Hi!
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.
- Oh, it's okay. It's okay.
- I'm assuming you're Aaron?
- Yeah. I'm Aaron.
- Nice to meet you.
- Josef.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
This is gonna be a good day.
- Yeah.
- You have a really nice,
kind face.
- Thank you.
- All right.
- Come on.
- Okay.
- I feel like we should just
do this right now
because at the end of the day
it's gonna be normal,
so let me just.
- Oh. Okay.
- Trust me, that's not gonna
be anything weird at all.
Never get used to those stairs.
All right.
So, welcome.
This is our
family vacation home.
A lot of special memories.
Can see, if you check out
these paintings,
I made these with my dad
when I was younger.
So, I'm sure
you're anxious to get started...
- Yeah.
- On all this.
- Okay.
- Let's get you over here.
I am a cancer survivor.
I had cancer in the liver,
spread to the lungs.
So, pretty bad.
They gave me the chemo.
I knocked it out.
Really, it was...
went into remission immediately.
It was...
it was pretty incredible.
Unfortunately, two months ago,
I started getting
these dizzy spells and
some... some sort of
weird cognitive misfirings.
I went back in
to see the doctor.
Brain tumor
size of a baseball here.
- Oh, no.
- That's inoperable.
Um, so they gave me about
two to three months to live.
I'm hoping I beat it, you know?
And the power
of positive thinking.
Maybe? You know, who knows?
But in case I don't,
I'm married.
My beautiful wife, Angela,
of six years,
is pregnant
with our first child.
Hi, Buddy.
We're calling it Buddy.
Um, and have you ever
seen the film
- No.
- It's a beautiful,
beautiful film.
Michael Keaton gets cancer
in the film,
and he makes a video diary
of himself for his unborn son.
- Oh, okay. Yeah.
- Yeah, you can see.
So, our job today
is to keep that camera rolling,
as we discussed,
and I just
want you to walk with me.
I don't know
exactly what I'm gonna do.
I want you to document me,
how I am.
I don't need to glorify me
or make me seem cool
or anything other
than what I am,
so, Buddy, you can see me
for the man I was.
And, um...
I hope you're up for it.
- Okay.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Let's do it.
- I thought you
were gonna run away.
- No.
Okay.
- This is for you.
- Oh, that's all right.
- No, no, no, no.
Take the whole thing.
This is, uh...
this is no longer
a business transaction, okay?
- Okay.
- This is a partnership,
and this is a journey
into the heart,
and I'm real glad
it's you coming with me.
I think we're gonna do great.
You ready for this?
- Okay, let's do it.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get in the tub.
- In the tub?
- Yeah, come on up.
It's okay. Come on.
- Oh, sorry.
- It's okay.
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
We're... we're gonna go
a lot deeper places than this.
- Okay? You all right?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- Yep.
- Okay.
You sure you're not hungry?
You want a sandwich or anything?
- No, I'm okay... I'm okay.
- All right, maybe when we get
out of the tub.
I'm getting in the tub.
You're not getting in the tub.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- All right, get comfortable.
- Okay.
- Okay, you rolling?
- Yep.
- Just checking.
I knew you were.
All right, Buddy.
Welcome to your first tubby.
When I was your age,
I used to take tubbies
with my dad.
We'd call 'em tubby time,
and it was pretty much
the greatest time of the day.
So since you and I might not
get to do a tubby together,
I thought we would have
our first tubby right here.
You ready?
Okay.
All right.
Now, let's get
those tootsies wet.
You ready? Get those tootsies.
Boo.
Oh, ooh, it tickles, doesn't it?
Oh, stinker.
Stinker-roo.
Oh.
Ooh, this one
actually smells pretty good.
I know, it's fun, isn't it?
I know.
Ooh.
Just lean back
and close your eyes.
A little shampoo.
A massage rub.
Mmm.
Yeah.
Mmm.
Now is my favorite part.
We're just gonna lay back.
Oh, Buddy.
Oh, yeah.
Ooh, ooh.
Ooh, you like the fire?
Mm. You just stay here.
We'll watch the fire.
You and me.
Mmm.
I love you so much.
Can't stop thinking about it,
Aaron.
- What?
- Two to three months.
Most of which I will either be
in pain,
or at the very least sad.
I mean, look at this scene.
It's a tubby scene.
It's supposed to be fun.
It's not supposed to be sad,
you know?
I just can't help thinking,
"Why wait?"
You know?
'Cause I could just
end it right now.
I could, you know.
- Josef?
Hey.
Josef?
Hey.
Josef.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Oh, man,
that was... that was a joke.
It was supposed to be a joke.
I'm so sorry.
That was a bad joke.
Okay.
I've got a weird sense
of humor, man.
I'm...
I'm really sorry about that.
- It's okay.
- Um, it was just getting,
like, really serious in here,
and I was just, like, you know,
trying to lighten the mood.
Do you want to go
outside or something?
You want to get some fresh air?
Would that be good?
- Yeah.
- Oh, Aaron. You might want
a heavier jacket.
It's a little chilly out there.
- Okay.
- There's...
there should be something
in the guest bedroom closet
if you want to snag one.
- Okay.
Cool.
- What? What? What happened?
What happened?
Oh.
That's Peachfuzz.
That's... that's just Peachfuzz.
Say hello.
Um...
Actually, you know,
I'm glad this happened.
Buddy, you're gonna love this.
So, Peachfuzz
is a friendly wolf,
and my dad created him
and he actually used to have
this great kind of song
that Peachfuzz sings
for little kids.
What do you think, Buddy?
That's Peachfuzz.
Say hi.
All right.
Oh, nice.
Look.
Got some hats.
Huh, twinsies.
I'm over here, Buddy.
Right here.
So, look, there's a legend about
this trail that we're going to.
It's called
Las Aguas Milagros de Corazon,
which means, "The miracle waters
of the heart."
Your mom and I heard about it
from this really cool
Hispanic lady
who runs this taco truck
down by the lake.
Anyway, the lore has it
that there's, like,
a healing body of water out here
that has something
to do with a heart,
but apparently only those
who are pure of heart
can partake of it.
So, anyhow, that is what
we're going to find today.
How's your heart, Aaron?
- It's good.
- It better be.
Whoo-hoo!
All right, Buddy.
Let's go cure some cancer.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Did you see that?
- No.
- Did you see anything up there?
- Uh-uh.
What was it?
- I thought I heard something.
- Josef?
Josef?
Hey, man.
Is everything okay?
Oh, my God.
Aaron.
Obviously you didn't see
your face.
Holy cow.
You... here.
I just need to
show you something.
You need to see your face.
All right, you're a little mad.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
- But oh, my God,
that was incredible.
That was... you just
had a near-death experience.
- Yeah.
- That's what it feels like
when you feel like
you're gonna die.
It's incredible, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I'm fine. Thanks. Thank you.
- All right.
It's powerful, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.
- You know,
what's really amazing is,
there was about
two seconds there
after you were done being scared
where it looked like
you wanted to kill me.
- No, I-I-I was...
it was just the...
- I don't take it personally.
I think it was
a visceral reaction, you know?
It's a defense thing, but...
but there's an animal in you.
There's a little Peachfuzz
inside you yet.
Anybody you need to make peace
with in this world?
Before you go?
- I have an ex.
- You have an axe?
- Ex.
- Oh, I thought you were
gonna tell me you had,
like, an axe to grind.
I have an axe back at the house.
- Yeah.
No, I saw it.
- Can I ask you a question
and you'll answer me honestly?
- Okay.
- When you saw that axe
out in front of the house,
was there a small part of you
that thought
I might kill you with it?
- Yeah, but I didn't know you.
- You did?
That's great.
- Josef, I don't remember
how long we've been walking for.
Are you getting hungry?
- Yeah, I know, I know.
But you're doing great
and just...
we got to keep in motion.
- Okay.
- Look.
Look. There's a sign.
Hey. Little something.
- All right.
- Healing waters, here we come.
- "Sewer pipeline."
It's shit water.
- It's something.
Better than nothing.
Come on.
- Josef.
- What's up?
- Are you...
you remember how to get back?
- No. I don't.
- Okay.
It's just we've taken a lot of...
a lot of forks in the road,
switchbacks that...
I just... I haven't been
keeping track, so...
- I haven't either.
But that's... I mean,
that's back there, man.
We got to...
- We got to go forward.
- Okay.
- You know,
we can't find the miracle
if we got a rope attached to us,
you know what I'm saying?
- Right.
- Holy shit.
Holy shit. Holy shit.
- Josef.
- Come see!
It's a lookout point.
See?
Aaron.
- Yeah?
- You are not gonna
ever believe this.
Aaron, I want you
to point your camera down there
and tell me what you see.
- Oh, my God.
It's a heart, man.
That's a heart down there.
You were right.
- It's a heart.
But it's also a miracle.
Only the pure of heart
can be healed.
Yes.
Heal those big ol' tootsies.
Amazing.
Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!
- It's chilly, huh?
All right.
Whoo!
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
Okay, you do me.
Tell you what.
I know a little place
called Billy Bear's.
It has the best god damn
pancakes in the world.
- You still hungry?
- Yeah.
- All right. I'm buying lunch.
- All right, let's do it.
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
- Let's see what's good here.
- It's the pancakes, right?
Didn't you say you used to
come here with your family?
- What's that?
- Didn't you used to
come here for years?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, it's just
they changed the menu,
so I was just curious
if there was anything else,
but yeah, I mean,
obviously the pancakes
are the thing.
Hey, Aaron.
- Yeah?
- Have you ever done anything
you're really ashamed of?
- Yeah.
- Would you mind
telling me about it?
- Uh, yeah, okay.
- Really?
Here, give me the camera.
Come on, I'll... it'll be fun.
I'll...
- Okay.
- Take the focus
off of me for a second.
There we go.
Handsome devil.
- Um, okay.
Um, I guess... let me think.
I was, um...
I used to...
I used to just pee my pants
a lot,
um, when I was a little kid.
- Ooh.
- And, um...
it got to the point
where my mom got this, uh...
device from a mail-order
catalogue that was, um...
it was like a... like a thing
attached to my wrist
with a wire that went up my arm
and down my shirt
into my pants.
- And with a little sensor
on it that would...
that would beep at the sound
of... or at the...
it would...
when it felt wetness.
And, uh, I remember one time
when I was just out on
the monkey bars with my friends,
I had to go really bad,
and I didn't want to,
and I just... I just started
just pissing my pants.
And then... and then the monitor
starting going off,
and so there I was,
you know, laying in the sand
just with piss all over myself
and this loud alarm going off.
And that was probably
the first time,
or at least the first time
I remember, feeling...
feeling shame.
- Thanks for sharing
that with me, man.
- Yeah.
- It's not easy
to talk about that stuff.
- I appreciate it.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Can I have a turn?
- Uh, yeah.
Okay.
What?
What is that?
Is that...
That's me.
- Yeah.
I took pictures of you.
- Okay.
Why?
- I don't know.
I suppose I was nervous
before you came up,
and I felt that
if I got to know you
before you got to know me,
then I would be less scared.
I'm sorry.
I wouldn't have done it
if I knew you then
like I know you now.
And I'm very ashamed of it,
and I hope we can move past it.
Okay?
- Okay. No, I'm... it's...
it's a little weird,
but I'm... I'm past it.
- You are?
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's fine.
- Thank you.
- Josef.
- Yeah?
- I think...
I think I'm gonna head back.
Um, I got...
I got all my stuff on me.
I just think I'll just
head back down the hill now.
- Oh.
Oh.
I was going to
pour you a whiskey.
- Yeah, no. It's okay.
I-I think, uh...
I think it's a long drive,
and it's kind of treacherous
going down the hill.
I think I'll just...
- It takes about 20 minutes
going down.
You can coast the whole way;
It's not...
I think we should
commemorate our day, Aaron.
I feel like we should
raise our glasses together
and celebrate.
One drink, okay?
One drink, and I'll send you
on your merry way.
Please?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- One drink.
- Great.
- Sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.
I keep doing that.
Come on, let's go.
This is great, huh?
Two guys having some whiskeys.
It's really great, man.
What a great day, you know?
And I don't take my days
lightly.
I mean, really.
I could've spent it
with my family,
but I made a new friend.
Just a great day.
- Yeah, it was a good day.
- Yeah.
What made you decide
to come up here
and do this with me, anyway?
- I guess it was a job.
- The money, huh?
- Yeah.
- You having money problems,
Aaron?
- No.
- It's okay.
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.
People have money problems.
- I mean, it's tough,
but, you know...
- Of course it's tough.
When I was your age, I didn't
have a row to hoe, you know?
It took a while before I
accumulated the wealth I have,
and I've actually accumulated
quite a bit.
And, um...
I've been
thinking about it today,
and I want to give
you some money, Aaron.
- No, thank...
That's... that's nice of you,
but it's okay.
- Why is everyone
so uncomfortable with money?
Look, if you had
an excess of food,
and I was hungry,
wouldn't you give it to me?
- Yeah.
- Yes, you would.
Because you're my friend,
and you're kind.
I have an excess of money.
You have a need.
It's simple.
- Oh, I...
- There's a check
in your boot, Aaron.
Gotcha.
All right.
Sorry.
There's not a check
in your boot,
but you looked,
which means you need money.
Let me help you.
We don't have
to figure it out now.
Just saying.
- Okay, um...
- Here. Cheers, to us.
- Okay, cheers.
All right.
Well, I think we're good.
Um...
- Where are you...
are you leaving?
- Here.
- Aaron, are you leaving?
- I think it's...
yeah, I think, um...
- I lied to you.
- What... what about?
- Peachfuzz.
Aaron, if I tell you something,
would you promise me you would
never tell another living soul?
I need to get something
off of my chest, before...
- Okay.
- But this is only for you.
Buddy, I'm sorry.
This is not for you to hear.
Aaron, would you sit down please
and turn the camera off?
- Um...
- Now.
- Okay.
Okay.
- It's off?
- Yeah, it's off.
- Okay.
I did something really bad.
About four years ago...
the internet started
to slow down at our house.
Spoke to a guy I knew at work
who said...
maybe my browser's history
was full.
I went home.
I opened up the internet.
Aaron, such unspeakable things
I saw.
Pornography.
Mostly animal pornography.
There's only two people
who use that internet.
Me and my wife, Angela.
And I was not looking
at animal pornography, Aaron.
I confronted Angela.
She flat-out denied it.
What could I say?
I knew it was her.
This lie drove a wedge
between us,
and we began to drift apart.
One weekend, I said we should
come up to the cabin.
Right here.
But on Saturday,
I was called back to work,
so I left Angela here
by herself.
The thing is, I wasn't really
called back to work.
I went down the street
to the 99 cent store.
There I found a mask.
It was a wolf.
Three hours later,
I came back to the house.
I put the mask on.
I broke in
through the back window.
Angela was asleep.
I tied her up,
at which point she awoke.
At which point,
we proceeded to have
ravenous, animalistic
sexual intercourse.
I'd never seen her so happy.
I have to admit, it didn't
feel terrible on my end.
I escaped through the window
and left her there, tied up.
When I came back
the next morning, as myself,
I asked her how her night was.
She said it was fine,
with a casual smile.
We never spoke of it.
We went home.
And in the weeks that followed,
the internet
got back up to speed.
Aaron, I raped my own wife.
So, in summation, this is me
in a nutshell, you know?
This is your dear old dad,
warts and all.
I want to say
that I love you, Buddy.
And, um...
- Okay.
- I think that's good.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I think that was great.
- That didn't feel great to me.
- No, I think...
I think we got it.
- I don't know,
that wasn't very certain.
- Have you seen my keys?
- They're in your jacket, right?
- Yeah, I thought they were.
- Well, maybe they're
in your jeans or something?
- I don't know.
- On the table?
I feel like if we get
one more take, we'll nail this.
- You know what?
I really think that was good.
I really think that was
the one, man.
- Is everything okay, Aaron?
- Yeah, just...
Yeah, we're...
- Aaron.
- Yeah?
- Did I freak you out
with my rape story?
- No.
- Why are you in such a hurry?
- Just...
- Aaron, come here, look.
You can stay here.
I've got plenty
of comfortable beds.
You know, we got...
there's whiskey here.
It's a long drive down to...
- Josef, I need to go home.
- I know, Aaron.
I know you need to go home.
But what I'm telling you
is that we cannot find
your keys.
It's dark in this house.
Technically, you are over 0.08.
If you get pulled over
by the police,
you will get a DUI.
In the morning, this house'll be
flooded with light.
We'll find your keys.
You'll be sober.
And you can drive home then.
You understand?
Sorry I raised my voice.
- Sorry I got a little antsy
back there.
- That's okay.
- Yeah, I just...
I think the roads
are probably treacherous.
- It's a good call.
- Yeah.
- This is the right move.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.
- Yep.
Good.
- All right.
Here we go.
- All right.
Oh, it's a big one.
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up?
Well, all right.
If you say so.
Ah.
Ooh!
Okay.
I want to do
my final take again.
Is this thing still set?
- Yeah. We're good.
- So, in summation, Buddy,
I just want us...
let me start that over.
- You're doing good.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
So, in summation, Buddy, um...
That didn't taste weird to you?
- No, it was good.
Do you want another?
- No. I'm good.
So, in summation, Buddy,
I love you, and I miss you.
I'm sorry I died.
Just, it feels weird.
- Josef?
- Oh, what'd you do?
What... Aaron, what'd you do?
Why did you do that?
Aaron, why did you do that?
Aaron, what did you do?
What did you do?
- It's okay. Go to sleep.
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.
It's okay. It's okay.
- Hello, Peachfuzz.
Mmm, Peachfuzz.
- No, Josef.
- Mmm, Peachfuzz.
- Josef.
- Mmm.
You should come lay with me.
I'm tired.
I love you so much.
I'm so sorry.
Stay up all night.
- Hello?
-
- Angela?
-
- No, this is Aaron.
-
- He's... he's sleeping.
-
- Aaron.
Your husband hired me.
-
- Your husband hired me
to film him.
For the cancer.
-
- We're at your house
in Crestline.
-
- What the fuck's going on?
-
- Lady, I'm trying to leave.
I can't find
my fucking car keys.
-
- Am I in danger right now?
-
- Brother?
Josef's your brother?
That's...
your brother has cancer?
-
- Hello? Hello?
Shit.
Oh.
Shit.
- Death.
- It's coming.
There's nothing we can do.
I don't want to die, Aaron.
I don't want to...
I don't want to die.
Oh, Aaron.
Oh, God.
- I know.
- I know you know.
I love you.
You're such a good friend.
I love you so much.
- Josef.
I know.
- I know you know.
- Josef.
I know what's going on here.
I know you're troubled.
I'm willing to help.
Look, I'm not angry.
So, just give me my keys,
and we'll...
we'll take it from there.
I talked to Angela, man.
Josef.
Please let me go.
Are you gonna let me go?
Why are you doing this to me?
Are you... are you
just trying to scare me?
Or... okay, look.
Well, I'm terrified, okay?
You won.
- Now, will you just
please step aside and let me go?
Stop.
Stop it.
Stop it!
Stop it!
- Stop it!
Okay, um, so a little...
a little context here.
After our scuffle,
I don't know where he went.
He just ran off.
I, uh...
I had to get my car towed.
And now I'm home.
And, you know,
I-I thought this was over.
I was just writing it off
as just a weird thing
that happened.
And, lo and behold,
a few days later,
I got this in the mail,
which means he knows my address.
That's a little disconcerting.
I don't know, I'm kind of having
trouble interpreting it.
I-I guess that's a...
he's supposed
to be digging a grave there
and, you know,
there's these bags.
I don't know if that's supposed
to be a body or something
in the bags that's chopped up.
Um, I don't know.
I mean,
is that supposed to be me?
Okay. You know what?
No.
We are just going to
get rid of this
and pretend like
it didn't happen.
There we go.
That's it.
Okay.
Maybe that's not it.
I've been having
crazy ass dreams tonight.
And it's me and Josef,
and we're at the Heart Rock.
Only it's a hot tub.
And we're just...
we're both sitting in it,
and he's got
the Peachfuzz mask on,
and I don't think that's weird
'cause I have one on too.
Only mine's like a...
like a... like a baby mask.
Baby wolf.
And we're drinking wine.
And then he leans over to me,
and he just starts
pouring the wine over my head.
And I look down
and I realize I'm...
I'm a little baby,
and he's giving me a tubby.
And there's something weird
about the water.
I put my hand in it
and reach up,
and it's just covered in blood.
It's just a weird dream.
I got to stop thinking
about this guy.
Just heard the doorbell ring
while I was in the bathroom,
and the delivery guy
left this on my doorstep.
There's no return address,
so I have a good idea
who it's from.
-
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
It's time to call the cops.
Hi. Hi.
My name is Aaron Franklin.
I'm calling to report
a violent domestic incident
and a stalker.
Well, I don't know
if he's dangerous-dangerous,
but he's really weird
and super creepy
and I'm starting
to get scared for my safety.
His name is Josef.
Or at least I think it is.
He lies a lot.
No, I don't know...
I don't know his last name.
No, I... I don't know
where he lives.
We met in a cabin
he claimed was his,
but I looked it up,
and it's just some rental.
No, I have no way of finding him
or contacting him.
Well, there must be something
you can do.
Can't you send someone over to
take fingerprints or something?
He... he sent me a heart locket
and a knife.
You can use those.
Well, I'm glad
you're taking this seriously.
You guys have been
entirely unhelpful.
I'm sure I'll be
sleeping soundly tonight.
So, I'm still having nightmares.
It's, like, the same one
over and over again,
just slightly different.
Anyway, it's like we're...
we're still in a hot tub,
but the hot tub has,
like, these,
like, retractable spikes
and when you sit down on 'em,
it's like they push up...
Okay. Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Lights.
Lights. Lights.
Lights. Lights.
Is anybody here?
Hello?
Josef?
Hello?
If there's anyone trespassing
on the premises,
let it be known I have a knife.
I'm... I'm not afraid to use it.
I...
What was that?
Josef?
Hello?
Josef?
Is there anyone there?
God damn raccoons.
The last couple nights
have been pretty normal
until this.
This is where I sleep.
This is a broken screen
in my window.
This is not good.
All right.
-
- What the hell
am I supposed to do with this?
Look at him.
He's so sad.
All right, Josef.
I'm here.
You got me.
But know that I'm filming this,
and my phone is set to
speed dial to 911.
It keeps getting better.
I remember the first time
I watched this, Aaron,
and I thought to myself,
"Okay, it was smart that you
filmed it,
"and it was smart
that you put your phone
on speed dial for the cops."
But why didn't you at least
look behind you?
I mean, it just seemed dumb
that you would just sit there.
And then I realized
why you didn't turn around.
It's because you're the greatest
person that's ever lived, Aaron.
No matter what I did to you,
you believed I was good
and I would do you no harm.
And that is why
I will always love you.
And why you'll always be
my favorite
of them all.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Everything's okay.
Not a care in the world.
It's all over.
Hello?
Yes, this is Bill.
The job is pretty simple,
really.
All you need is a video camera,
yourself,
and eight hours of your time.
Mm-hmm.
Great. Great.
Well, I look forward
to meeting you.
Okay.
All right,
see you tomorrow, buddy.
