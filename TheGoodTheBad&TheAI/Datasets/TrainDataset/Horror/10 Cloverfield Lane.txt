'Ben'
Michelle, please don't hang up.
Just talk to me, okay?
I can't believe you just left.
Michelle
Come back.
Please say something.
Michelle?  Talk to me.
Look, we had an argument, couples fight,
that is ..
No reason to just leave everything behind.
Running away isn't going to help anything.
Michelle, please ..
PARAMOUNT PICTURES
Presents:
'NO SIGNAL'
Okay, ok .. please.
Please ..
Please don't hurt me.
Please,
Just let me go, okay? I won't tell anybody,
I promise.
Please just let me go.  Please.
You need fluids.
You were in shock.
What're you going to do to me?
I'm going to keep you alive.
Work on getting handy with these.
My boyfriend was expecting me.
He'll send the cops looking.
I'm sorry ..
But no one is looking for you.
You got some fight in you.
I can respect that.
But don't even think about trying that again.
You're lucky to be here at all.
My generosity only extends .. so far.
Eggs,
Tylenol to help with your pain.
Please .. please .. just let me go.
- Please.
- There's nowhere to go, Michelle.
That looks pretty .
Given it as how I saved your life,
I think that's acceptable.
You're lucky to be here at all.
- What do you mean?
- I found you.
And I saved your life, by bringing you here.
I don't understand,
There's been an attack.
What?
An attack. A big one.
I'm not sure yet if it's chemical, or nuclear.
But down here we're safe.
And where are we, exactly?
Underneath my farmhouse.
- I ..  was driving north of here.
- You were in an accident.
You were turned over on the side of the road.
I was driving by, and I saw you.
I saved your life, Michelle.
I couldn't just leave you there.
Thank you so much, for saving my life.  I ..
I guess I should, I should go to a hospital, now.
You can't leave.
An attack means all of them.
Which contaminates the air above ground.
That's, that's how it works.
How, how long do we have to wait until it's safe?
Depends on the proximity to the closest blast.
One year, maybe two.
And that's if we're, we're talking
about weapons that we know of.
Russians were developing some nasty stuff.
And it the martians finally found a way to get here.
Their weapons will, will make our nukes
look like, like sticks and stones.
Luckily,
I prepared for this.
I need to use your phone, then,
To call my family.
And, and tell them that I'm safe here.
- And make sure they're okay.
- Michelle, they're not okay.
How do you know that?
Everyone outside of here is dead.
What about you?
Don't you have a family?
No
Who's that?
Excuse me.
What is it now?
Wait.
You know what, Michelle?
I'm going to tell you, what I told him..
You need to eat, you need to sleep,
And you need to start showing me a
little bit of appreciation.
My name is Howard, by the way.
God, oh shit.
I'm sorry,
Sorry about that.  I didn't mean to ..
Scare you.
You, hmm,  hmm, you hungry?
So how're you doing, huh?  You okay?
What is this?
It's a bunker.
Your room is a bit of a fixer-upper, but ..
At least you got the door.
A scary door, but you still got the door.
How long have you been down here?
A couple of days, I think.  You know,
it's actually kind of hard to tell.
No windows, the sunlight, and everything.
I mean, how do we get out of here?
He didn't tell you?
About ..
Getting out of here,
is the last thing you want to do.
Cause the air out there,
It's contaminated.
I see you've met Emmett
- What happened to him?
- He did that to himself.
And his stumbling around isn't helping anything.
What you heard earlier,
Was him knocking over a shelf with
a whole week's worth of food.
Which he's sorry for, correct?
Totally.
Let's go.  Bathroom time.
This is the common are.  Good for R&R.
As you can see, I've planned for a long stay.
The applaponic system cleans
the air and keeps it fresh.
This is the living room.
Help yourself to any reading.
If you like to watch films,
I have some on DVD and VHS cassette.
Just make sure you put them back
in their sleeve when they're done.
The kitchen is fully functional. There's
an electric stove, refrigerator.
Freezer, silverware.
And that table is a family heirloom,
which means watch your glasses.
Always use coasters and placemats.
Keep you hands to yourself!
Understand?
No touching.
Take a seat.
This way.
This is my private space
Off-limits,
unless I give express permission.
Go ahead.
- Nah, I don't need to.
- You will though.
And I've got to pace these things out,
so please.
- I need privacy.
- You're welcome to close the curtain.
I can't with you standing there.
And I can't trust you not to burn this
place down. This is for my own safety.
I'm not some .. pervert.  Just go.
Don't flush unless you've gone.
Can't afford wasting flushes.
Take a seat.
Are you hungry?
Those are Megan's.
She never went anywhere without two
or three of those things.
Who's Megan?
Megan's not with us anymore.
Don't worry.  Just the generator.
Maybe it's a car up front.
- That's not possible.
-  I heard one earlier.
Above my room.
If you had heard a car,
the driver would be long dead by now.
Shouldn't we at least try
.. to call the police?
- Someone to find out what actually happened?
- There's no one left to call.
See that?  Nothing's coming through.
You think I sound crazy.
It's amazing, you people..
You wear helmets when you ride your bikes,
you have seat-belts,
You're in your cars,
you have alarm systems to protect your homes.
But what do you do when those alarms go off?
Crazy, is building your ark after
the flood is already come.
I think now might be time you
met Frank and Mildred.
Closest I can get to in airlock.
See?
What happened to them?
They weren't as lucky as you.
It's the air, Michelle.
That's what happens when you get exposed.
I keep this door sealed, at all times.
No one comes in or out.
Met Frank and Mildred, huh?
It's funny, right?
The whole world ends.  And the thing's he's
most upset about is a pair of dead pigs.
You gonna need some .. uh, reading material.
That's all there is , sorry.
My idead of how to learn to do
a french braid, so..
If you want me to do that for you,
just let me know.
What do you know about him?
He was in the Navy, I know that.
I guess he did, uh,
some stuff with satellites.
What kinds of stuff?
Satellite .. stuff.
And what brought him out here?
I'm not sure.
He bought this property a whle back.
I never paid much attention, until he
hired me to help him get this place set up.
The work, was, uh..
Entertaining, though, that's for sure.
You know, Howard, is like a black belt
in conspiracy theories.
Plus, you know, how often do you get
hired to build the doomsday bunker?
He .. kidnapped you?
No.
What happened to your arm?
You were trying to escape?
I was trying to get in.
And I watched Howard build this
place, piece by piece, for years.
He was always talking about..
you know, possible attacks,
Al-Qeda, Russia, South Korea,
- You mean North Korea?
- the, the.. is that the Korean one?
Yeah, that one.  Hmm ..
And, hmm, you know. Pour all his money into this
place, took to it, like his life depended on it.
Which,.. you know,
That stays with you.
So,
He told all this,
While you're building his bomb shelter,
And now he says that ..
The air is contaminated, and everybody's dead.
Yeah, I know what you're getting at.
But there's more to it.
Howard abducted me.
He drove me off the road,
and he dragged me here.
So whatever he's telling you
about the .. air,
- Some big attack. The purpose of this shelter, is a lie.
- No, no way.
The attack, I saw it myself.
What do you mean?
Coming on my way from work,
And, looked like a flash.
Bright red,
Like an explosion, from way far off.
Wasn't like fireworks,
No, it was more this like something
your read about in the bible.
So what you saw was a flashing light?
Lightning?
- Fire that cleared up?
- I'm not .. explaining it right.
This wasn't like anything I've ever seen.
Right here,
Above us.
Did you hear someone?
Right over me .
That's impossible.
- The, the air, is ..
- What, it's contaminated?
- How do you know that?
- Because I told him.
Dinner's ready.
I see you two are getting along?
How's that sauce?
- It's fine,
- As cooks go, I'm okay.
Not great, but okay.
Megan was a good cook.
You'll learn a little cooking.
It's delicious.
It's the best sauce I ever tasted.
Are you being funny?
No, I mean ..
Considering the alternative,
which is, you know..
Get burned up in a chemical
attack, or nuclear ..
I say being alive, and down here is ..
It's made a fried turd taste
pretty good, so..
Best damn sauce I ever had.
and  you point,
and please watch your language at the table.
Right.
You know what I haven't been able to
get out of my head, for some reason.
Ever since I got down here,
Tatoos.
I always wanted one.
But I never got any.  Because everyone always said, nah, no,
Emmett you'll never get a decent job if you got it.
Whatever
Like that matters now, right?
Tell you what, I had know this was coming,
I'd gotten like 50 of them.
That's where I'm at.
I would look like a circus freak or something.
I would just be covered.  Head to toe, tattoos all over ..
Everywhere, face, shirt, right there.
Across my forehead.
Just my name, Emmett.
Or, you know..
- "Thug Life"
-
- 'YOLO'
I don't even know what that means, but, I hear
people saying it all the time.  So it must be cool.
Hey, what about you, Howard?
Anything you wish you'd done?
In all honesty, no.
No?
No crazy nights in Vegas?,
Maybe, ah, take a pilgrimage to Waco?
Everything I wanted to do, I did.
I focused on being prepared.
And I was.
And here we are.
Oh, my goodness..
Is that Monopoly?
There we go.
Yeah, that's how we kill the time.
I mean, what you say?  We're going to be
down here like what, a year, two, three?
Bet you if we started a game right now,
we might even get halfway finished..
Stop talking!
You don't need to make jokes about how
long we're going to be down here.
When nobody knows how long that's going to be.
You humor is not funny.
I don't appreciate it while I'm trying
to eat, and neither does Michelle.
Now please shut up, and let us eat in peace.
Emmett?
Pass me a napkin.
I know what you're saying.
I never could finish Monopoly.
That game really does take forever, right?
For me though, it was .. hmm,
'Chutes, and Ladders'.  Ahmm,
'Sorry',
and 'Trouble'.
And that thing with the dice, and that thing
that you press, what is that called?
That,  that .. 'PoppleMatic Bubble!',
yeah, right!
You ever play that, what was it, 'Operation'?
- Loath 'Operation"
- Oh, man, I couldn't play that game.
That noise that thing would make
when you hit that edge, when..
- Good lord,
- That was scary.
Can you give me the salt?
Please?
Ah, shoot.  Sorry.
I'm going to need the pepper also,
- What exactly do you think you're doing?
- I'm just asking for the pepper.
- The hell you were?  What was that?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
You trying to insult me?
Here in a shelter that I built,
that's keeping you alive?
You don't think I see what you just did?
Is that how you thank me for saving your life?
- Calm down.
- Shut Up!
Shut Up!  And stay in your seat!
Is it?
Let me tell you,
I know what a traitor looks like,
Understand?
I have shown you nothing but
generosity, and hospitality.
I want you to apologize.
And tell me you're going to behave.
I will.
You will what?
I'll behave.
And I'm so sorry.
You have to stay hydrated, .
It's easy to forget down here.
What's wrong?
Nothing
Where are my keys?
Michelle!
Stop!
Give me those keys!
- Come on.
- I'm going.
No! No!
No! Don't do it!
No!
Don't open that door!
It's a car!
It's a car!  I see a car!
Here!  Here!
Here!
Michelle, listen to me, don't do it!
Help me!
- There's a woman.
- Open the door.
- I just.. I want to come inside.
- She looks hurt, she wants me to let her in!
Do not let her in!
Look at her face, Michelle!
No, no, no .. no, no.
Please open,  I don't want to die.
Please, help me, I don't want to die.
Just a little, oh , please open the door.
- Open it.
- She's begging me!
You can't help her!
- Nobody can.
- It'll be okay.
It' be okay, all of us.
Open the door!
Don't listen to her!
Open the door, you bitch!
Let me in!
Let me in!   Let me in!   Let me in!
Now!
Now.  Now!
Now!
Open!
I know it's hard.
Realizing they're all gone.
The ones you love.
I have something to confess to you.
I crashed into your car.
Your accident.
Was my fault.
When I found out about the incoming
attack, I got frantic.
I knew I needed to get back here
as soon as possible,
Oh, I was driving like a maniac,
I tried to pass you, and..
I'm the reason you went off the road.
And I know I seem like a sensible guy,
But, at the time, I wasn't myself.
It was an accident.  But it was my fault.
I was afraid to tell you.
I'm sorry.
You should shower,
You had the smallest amount of air that
came through the hinges, could be toxic.
These are Megan's.
If you want them.
I recognize that woman's car.
Her name was Leslie, I think.
You knew her?
She was a neighbor.
Emmett wasn't the only one
that knew about this place.
If any others somehow survived,
they could be coming here too.
As of Friday, kindness and generosity
are antiquated customs.
I'm going to need some stitches.
Why, you want me to..?
This is your doing, isn't it?
I mean,
I don't think I'm really qualified.
I'll walk you through it.
Here.
Have a drink.
What is it?
Technically, it's ..
Vodka
Safe.  I distill it myself.
- I just said I distill it, I didn't say anything
about it tasting good. -- Yeah, that's awful.
You want it on the rocks.
Little trick I taught myself as a young man
stationed on a ship, with way too much free time.
Every now and again, if the CO was working us
too hard. We'd freeze and snap the knob off..
the bathroom door while they were still inside.
I guess it took an hour or two, to get out
I'm good.
Suit yourself.  Cheers.
This is clean.
All you need to do is .. stitch.
You're doing fine.
Stuff I grabbed from your car.
Didn't have time to bring in the booze.
Sadly.
What is all that?
I wanted to design clothes.
No wonder you were so good with the stiches.
Megan wanted to be an artist.
- She was your daughter?
- Yeah
She was smart, loved to read,
the magazines or just for fun.
She inhaled books.
Anything with Paris.
She liked their movies.
Their culture, you know.
We used to have this little joke,
every once in a while, I'd ask her..
What do you want to be
when you grow up?
And you know what she'd say?
French.
Anyway,
Her mother turned her against me.
Took her off to Chicago.
People are strange creatures
You can't always convince them that
safety is in their own  best interest
You don't know they're gone.
Anyway,
At least I tried to help them.
Hey, you know there is nothing
you could've done for that woman
Even if you had let her in,
she still would've died.
You asked earlier about .. regrets,
Yeah, I got some of those.
Welcome to the club.
I mean, I lived my life
in a 40-mile radius.
And that was by design,
I made sure that happened.
I was so fast in high school,
I even managed to outrun my bad grades.
I was all-state track,
Three years in a row.
Caught a full ride to Louisiana Tech
up there in Ruston.
I remember I spent the last
two weeks of that summer,
Showing off the bus ticket they
sent me, to anybody who looked at it
And then came the night
before I was supposed to leave,
And I just got so worried,
About how bad I was
going to do up there
With all those smart kids
So I went out of my way
To get just pissed wasted, so bad that
There was no chance I was waking
up in in the morning.
So I missed the bus
I didn't buy a ticket for the next one
Or the one after that.
Well, if you'd gone,
you might be dead now.
Well, lucky me, right?
Lucky us.
A few, a few years ago,
I was at a hardware store
And there was this little girl,
with her Dad.
And he was in a hurry,
and she wasn't keeping up.
and he kept
yanking on her arm,
really hard, you know.
too hard.
You know that feeling?
When my Dad got that way,
my brother Collin was always there.
To take the worst of it.
For me.
And after seeing that little girl,
I thought maybe I could
do that
For her.
But I just kept watching
And they were about to leave,
and I'd done nothing.
And,
she slips
And it throws him out off-balance
and he hits her
And I wanted so badly to do something.
To help her, but
I do what I always do
when things get hard
I just panicked and ran.
Look,
We're here, we're alive.
And that means something.
got it?
You've got to be kidding me.
What?
We're missing pieces here.
Look at this poor cat.
He's been deformed,
he's got one eye.
About to go snorkling and
everything too.
What are you doing?
Ooh, cornering the market on
post-apocalyptic fashion, huh?
Needs more axes and chainsaws.
For what, she has a shotgun.
Yeah, what if up there it's like..
-  tracks?
- Zombies.
Though even Howard doesn't think that one's possible.
Though you should hear his theory
about mutant space-worms.
What is that? Howard?
Stay calm. We're okay.
- What was that?
- Quiet.
That sounds like helicopters.
Could be military.
But not ours.
How can you tell?
- 14 years in the Navy.
- What's happening up there?
My guess, those flashes that kicked
this all off,
That was phase 1.
Take out your opponent's population centers,
with big hits, all at once
Fast.
And then for round 2.
Ground sweeps.
The satellite log shows an
increase in coded traffic recently.
Possibly extra-terrestrial signals.
I bet what we just heard were air-borne
patrols sent to hunt down
the remaining signs of life.
Like us.
Okay, oh boy..
That's bad.
And that's worse.
What was up there?
Air filtration system.
I can't.. something is
blocking the hedge.
If we can't get it back up, we're
gonna run out of breathable air fast.
You're the only one
small enough to reach it.
Reach what?
The filtration system.
Through there, the main duct.
Someone needs to get in there
and re-start it.
Give me a hand.
- Let me go in, she won't know her way around.
- You won't fit, plus your arm. She'll be fine.
Now, to re-start the unit, you just
swing the handle off and on. Off and on.
That should do it.
And neither of us will be able
to go in and help you if you get stuck.
Don't get stuck.
Michelle?
Everything okay up there?
Looks like a dead end.
That's the incline.
Climb up that,
and you're almost there.
Oh, this sucks.
'HELP'
What's wrong?
He lied to you, he lied about Megan.
What do you mean?
I think he did something horrible to her.
How?.
His family moved to Chicago
years ago.
What's this?
Is that blood?
Come with me.
Wait, is that..
She went missing, two years back.
It was on the news and everything.
Most people just thought she skipped town.
There is a message up there.
It said 'HELP'. It was scratched on the inside of the window.
This earring was with it.
Did she ever show up, after she went missing?
He said to me, he said to my face.
He said this is his daughter, he said this...
He took her and he killed her.
I was just thinking,
Maybe we
take away his gun
Tie him up, to confess. Whatever it is he's done
- What confess to who, the police?
Look, like I said,
We can't be the only survivors, right?
- The woman, she was able to get
around a little, right? -- Yeah, till she died.
Directly above us, choking to death.
Now, that's a great example of teamwork.
Very well done.
Feel like some music.
Problem solving always puts me
in a musical mood.
Michelle,
You should go shower, just in case.
Sure
The Exciters  - Tell Him
I think I might have an idea.
- '10 Better Ways to Style My Bangs'?
- No, not the article.  This.
I think I can only make one.
But it's a start.
No kidding.
Hey, Howard
What is this?
You're re-watching '16 Candles'?
'Pretty in Pink'
It was one of Megan's favorite movies.
Can I help you with something?
No, no, I'm just grabbing some water.
Say, ahmm,
You know, I was just thinking..
Not, that I'm trying to tell
you how to run this place.
But I am just,
a bit curious
about Michelle
Say, how close do you think
she got to the air filtration unit?
You think she touched it?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she touched it.
Yeah, I know she cleaned up after, and
everything.. But I'm just thinking..
Given that unit filter has
got god knows what from outside
If she tracked anything back in with
her. It would be pretty concentrated
And
Could be all over the shower,
and the sink, bathroom, right now.
Well, anyways, it's just a thought.
Not bad so far, partner.
If Howard find this, he's going
to kill us.
Alright, so, we get the gun away from him,
Tie him up, make sure
he isn't going anywhere.
And then one of us
just..
Goes out, and looks for help.
Ahmm, first word..
tiny..
Small, pygmie..
- Little.
- Yup.
Alright, ahh
Second word,
Michelle, is a..
ahmm, girl
hmm, a girl, a child
ahh, a girl.
No, she's older, so she is a..
A little princess?
ahh, No.  It was ..
Woman.
'Little Women'..
Well,
a little woman,
Next time,
Try to be a little more .. specific.
I'm always watching
Always.
ahmm, god.
I go wherever I want.
I mean, ah, I don't know.
I know what you're doing,
I see what you're doing.
I know what you're up to.
Look, Howard.
I don't know what you're getting at,
I see when you're sleeping
- I don't know, what...
- I know what you're doing,
- ahh, I don't know..
- and I'm always watching. Always watching.
Santa Claus.
You're Santa Claus.
Yeah, Michelle, that's great.
Okay, except it was Emmett's turn.
- Yeah, I got a little excited...
- well, I'm keeping that point.
Totally, you earned it.
Emmett?
Hey,
I need your help with something.
Sure.
You.  On deck.
What is this?
A barrel.
Move it into the bathroom.
This is sulphoric acid.
Do either of you know what that is?
It's usually produced
as a precursor to
ammonium proclorate.
Fuel.
Used to launch naval cell
like the ones in North Harvard.
It's highly corrosive.
Dissolves most biological material on contact.
With humans,
Right down to the bone.
Hey, Howard, ahh..
What're you showing it
to us this for?
You think I'm an idiot?
Howard, please, you're going to have to
tell us what you're talking about.
I'm talking about getting rid of some waste.
Tell me what you two
were doing with this.
You tell me what you two were planning.
Right now!
Take it easy, Calm down.
- Howard, please.
- I'm giving you one chance.
Howard, just calm down.
One chance!
to answer with some dignity or I swear to god
You're going into this barrel
while you're alive to feel it.
It was me.
Alright, not her, It was just me.
- No, no -- Stay out of this.
She doesn't have a clue
what she's talking about.
I wanted your gun.
And so I was,
Thinking about making a weapon
To get it,
From you.
I want her to respect me,
the way she respects you.
I'm not saying I was right, okay?
And I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
- I am sorry.
I accept your apology.
He was going to hurt us.
He was going to hurt you.
It's okay, this is okay.
This is the way it was always supposed to be.
You're safe now.
Now, it's just you and me.
It's okay.
Now, you should go to your room now.
This is not part of anything
you need to see.
Michelle?
Hey,
I thought we'd change
things up tonight.
And have dessert before dinner.
After all, we can do
whatever we want now.
Would you like a cone or a bowl?
Megan always wanted hers a bowl.
the cones are too messy.
I know this is not the life you prefer.
And it isn't easy for
you living down here.
But I want us to be a happy family.
You and me.
The mess is all taken care of.
So, just hang loose, and
I'll go get dinner started.
Everything alright?
Yeah, I was just about to do some reading.
It's time to set the table.
Supper is ready.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Keeps doing that.
I don't know why.
Michelle,
Why is this loose?
Get up.
- Why?
- Get up.
Get off the matress.
Now!
Oh, shit.
You're going to walk out on me?
After I saved you?
And kept you safe?
This is how you re-pay me?
No
This is.
Michelle!
You don't know what's out there.
