In the year 2046, a vast
rail network spans the globe
A mysterious train leaves
for 2046 every once in a while
Every passenger going to
They want to recapture lost
memories
Because nothing ever changes
in 2046
Nobody really knows if
that's true
Because nobody's ever come back
Except me
I f someone wants to I eave 2046...
...how long will it take?
Some people get away
fairly easily
Others find that it takes
them much longer
I forget how long I've been
on this train
I'm starting to feel very lonely
As I recall
many have gone to 2046
You're the first to come back
May I ask why you left 2046?
Whenever anyone asked
why I left 2046...
...I gave them some vague answer
Before...
...when people had secrets
they didn't want to share
...they'd climb a mountain
They'd find a tree
and carve a hole in it
And whisper the secret into the hole
Then cover it over with mud
That way. nobody else would
ever discover it
I once fell in love with someone
After a while. she wasn't there
I went to 2046
I thought she might be waiting
for me there
But I couldn't find her
I can't stop wondering if
she loved me or not
But I never found out
Maybe her answer was
like a secret...
that no one else would ever know
All memories are traces of tears
Didn't you promise not to
come back?
I came to see you
Why?
I have no prospects here
So I'll see how things are
in Hong Kong
When are you leaving?
The boat sails in two days
Why are you telling me?
I thought we might go together
You know nothing about my past
do you?
If you'd rather not tell me
I don't mind
If you win. I'll join you
She found an indirect way
of rejecting me
As I recall...
...that was the very last time
we saw each other
Right after that
I left Singapore
I got back to Hong Kong
at the end of 1966
Because of the price raise
of ferry ticket
There was riots in Kowloon
I wasn't sure how long
I'd be staying...
So I took a room in a small
hotel in Wanchai
I wrote columns for the Newspapers
They paid HK$10 per thousand words
I t was pretty tough at first
As long as I could make ends meet
...it made no difference what
kind of stuff I wrote
"Diary of the Bazooka Hero"
"The new star at
Club Luk Kwok is Fei Fei!"
"A knockout beauty with
amazing bazookas!"
"A smash hit with tit-lovers!"
Hang on. of course I exaggerate
I can't say her tits are fake
can I?
I soon got used to
this kind of life
I became an expert ladies' man
Lots of one-night-stands
But nothing lasts forever anyway
Is that really true?
Why would I lie to you?
You really know me?
Weren't you in a show in
Singapore in ' 64?
Yes
You' re Lu I u
I was then
Not any more
What's your name now?
Why should I tell you?
On Christmas Eve 1966...
...I ran into a friend from
Singapore in a night club
We'd been rather close
But that night...
...she'd apparent I y forgotten me
Have we really met before?
How could you forget?
You said I looked like
your late boyfriend
You taught me the cha-cha
Go on...
You were always dragging
me to the casino
You'd hit a losing streak
You owed a fortune
My friends and I paid
for your passage to Hong Kong
You talked a lot about
your late boyfriend
A Chinese Filipino from
a rich family
You planned to marry him
But he died young
You said he was the
love of your life
I shouldn't bring
back sad memories...
...at this time of year
But do you remember
that Christmas night...
...we went drinking?
We talked a lot
Was she just pretending
she'd forgotten me?
I took her back to her hotel
She was dead to the world
She'd had too much to drink...
...so I left quickly
On my way out. I noticed a
very familiar number
If I hadn't run into her that night
I wouldn't have seen that number
...and I wouldn't have written '2046'
Can I help you?
Is Miss Lulu in?
Lulu? There's no Miss Lulu here
There was a Mimi...
...but she's moved out
But I was here two days ago!
Do you know where she's gone?
No! What do you want with her?
Nothing. really
I have her key
I wanted to return it
You can give it to me
Thanks
You want to rent the room?
I'm just back from abroad
I don't have my own place yet
If the room's vacant
I could take a look
This is just a small hotel
But our residents are
all decent people
What's your line of work?
I write for newspapers
Great! A fellow artist!
I haven't always done this
I used to be an artist too
Really?
I took singing lessons
in Harbin
Back then. I was a tenor
It'll be a pleasure to
have you here
When will you move in?
As soon as possible
But...
Take a look at it
Never mind
I'll come back when it's ready
Why that particular room?
Maybe it's the number
It has some significance for you?
I'm joking
Tell you what...
Take a quick look at 2047
If it's okay. you can move in
Then switch to 2046
when it's ready
How about it?
Can I see the room?
Of course! Please...
Once I moved in...
...I found out what had
happened the night before
Lulu was stabbed by a
jealous boyfriend
A drummer from the club
She'd really liked him...
...and compared him with a
bird that could never land
For all these years...
She has been looking
for her legless bird'
Most of her affairs ended badly
But she didn't mind sad endings
No matter what happened...
...at least she was
always the leading lady
Good!
Sure!
Go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
I'll go with you!
Good. I'll go with you!
Sure!
I understand!
You know what I mean?
I know... I understand
I got it!
Can I go?
I can go!
Sure!
I understand!
Got it!
It didn't take long to
finish redecorating 2046
But by then I was used to 2047
Sure!
I started hearing a strange
voice through the wall
I thought someone had moved in
But it was the daughter of
the hotel owner. Mr. Wang
Definitely!
I'm definitely going!
Okay. let's go!
I had no idea what she was saying
The bell-hop told
me it was Japanese
It seems she had a Japanese boyfriend
Tell the driver "220 Granville Road"
Ga... ran... wai....
Turn from Humphreys Avenue
near to Kimberley Road
Can you say again?
Don't turn down Salisbury
Road Slowly. please...
I'll draw you a map
That's my pen!
I'll repeat it once more
Turn from Humphreys Avenue
Near to Kimberley Road
But don't turn down Salisbury Road
Understand?
I'll draw you a map
Granville Road
Turn from Humphreys Avenue
Don't turn down Salisbury Road
Remember
don't turn down Salisbury Road
His company in Japan had
sent him to Hong Kong
When he got here
he checked into this hotel
The world is full of men!
Why do you have
to choose a Japanese?
Get rid of him!
I will never meet him!
You want my blessing?
Not while I'm alive!
It had been going on for ages
Mr. Wang's family suffered
under the Japanese in the war
So they had to break up
Can you tell me what you feel?
Do you like me?
Or not?
I'm scared to hear your answer
But I have to ask anyway
Leave with me
Goodbye
The man finally went back to Japan
That's when Miss
Wang began talking to herself
Hey. ask your boss to turn it a bit!
Mr. Chow
you'd better ask him yourself
Mr. Chow....
Hasn't he left already?
Why is he back?
I will not see him!
If you won't give him up...
Get out! Go away with him!
I assumed that Mr. Wang
played it so loud...
...because he loved his opera
Actually he didn't want anyone
to overhear the family row
What are you doing?
Come back for me when
you're a little older!
I said. Wait till you grow up!
I like it
Mr. Wang thought about very little
...but his two daughters
The elder one was crazy
about her Japanese man
The younger one was
precocious for her age
She kept coming into
my room for drinks
Then she ran off with some man
Another drummer from a
club band. I heard
After she left. her elder
sister got into trouble too
Hey. have a word with
your boss for me
I'm a bit late with the rent
Anyway. he has my deposit
Mr. Chow. tell him yourself
He's in a foul mood these days
What's eating him?
First. one daughter ran away
Now the other one's in hospital
That's why he's so angry
Why is she in hospital?
He wouldn't say. he was
quite strange...
Steer clear of him!
So. that's it?
Anyhow. give him my invitation
It's my father's birthday banquet
He can deduct his gift
from the rent I owe
Later they imposed a
curfew in Hong Kong
Home-made bombs caused panic
The economy stopped dead
I stopped going out
Some thought I was a
reformed character
Actually. I was writing
A story called 2046
All about men and women
looking for love...
...risking everything to
get to a place called 2046
What's that?
Let's go to...
I made it as bizarre and erotic as
possible. without crossing the line
The readers liked it
Some didn't take to the
science-fiction angle
But all '2046' meant to me was...
...the number of a hotel room
I made up the whole thing
But some of my own experiences
found their way into it
People I ran into in the normal
course of things...
...turned up in my stories
I felt more and more at ease
in my fictional world
Around that time. Mr. Wang's
music got louder again
More trouble with his two
daughters...
But also because of the bad
state of the economy
Allot of the rooms were empty
Then in September
the rioting ended
Life went back to normal
Soon. someone moved into 2046
Have you nearly finished?
It's too early in the day for that!
Some of us are trying to sleep!
Peeking?
The woman next door is quite a dish!
What are my chances?
You're off your head!
A father-to-be shouldn't have
that on his mind!
Now she's pregnant
My wife won't let me touch her!
Come on
Put in a word for me
Okay...
How much?
How much have you got?
Only $100...
Wait for my call
Mr. Chow!
Mr. Chow. a call for you!
Bright and early. huh?
She's not up yet
Why come over?
I told you
It has to be arranged
She's not some streetwalker!
A fellow artist like you
Show her a little respect
will you?
Yes. I'll tell you right away!
Miss Bai. your key
You're back. Miss Bai
Who is it?
Who are you looking for?
Mr. Chow suggested I come by...
You're back. Mr. Chow
Did you win on the dogs?
I lost! I won a little
Looking for me?
I think you know this person?
What are doing in that room?
You said you'd arrange it!
I paid you!
When did I say it was this room?
I said that room
I said this one
Your girl's in that room
How embarrassing!
Please excuse him
I told you. the room on the left!
I said I wanted that one!
Shut up!
Who is it?
Oh. you again!
I just wanted to apologize
for last night
Forget it
Go away
Ping. my editor. was out of line
But he's not really so bad
Just a bit stingy!
Never pays his way!
Always says he's broke
when the check arrives
So I thought I'd play a trick on him
At my expense?
Didn't you go a bit far?
He only fell for it because
you're so beautiful
You're quite a flirt!
Just stating the fact!
A small token of apology...
Please accept it
I don't want it
You're still cross. aren't you?
Please accept it
No!
Come on...
No!
It's just a token...
Don't make fun of me
I mean what I say!
Now. get out!
That's good. let it all out
How can I make you feel better?
Slap me again!
Think I wouldn’t dare?
Come closer!
Bastard!
Don't be so petty!
That's enough
I'm courteous enough not to
slap you again
That doesn't mean you can
take advantage!
This time I'll give you face
If there's ever a next time
I'll be less polite
It won't happen again
My face is still numb
Accept it!
No!
They're just a token of my regard
I chose them myself
See if you like them
If you don't. just throw them away
Good
I'll leave now
Calm down!
It's none of your business
who I dated last night!
Who?
Dabao!
Which Dabao?
The fat one or the skinny one?
From Shanghai or from Shandong?
The trouble is
I know so many men named Dabao
How should I know which one you mean?
Yes. I did
What are you going to do about it?
Fine!
I'll be waiting!
Let me just say...
Get out!
You think I can accept this?
Her or me
You'd better choose!
Now get out!
You're back early!
It's Christmas!
Shouldn’t you behaving
dinner with your boyfriend?
What boyfriend?
Then let's have supper!
Come on...
You have so many girl friends!
You need company?
Go out with them!
They all want to be with me
but I can't choose
The fairest thing is to see
none of them
Come on. no point in staying
cooped up in your room
I'm not in a good mood tonight
I might get drunk...
...and slap you again
That's okay
I'm used to it!
If slapping me would make you happy
take that as my Christmas present!
Come on...
Come with me
Let go!
I didn't expect to spend
Christmas Like this
What were you expecting?
We'd made plans
He was taking me to Singapore
He says it's warm
there at Christmas
So I didn't even
pack winter clothes
What I'm wearing now...
...is for summer!
Have you been to Singapore?
I worked there for several years
What kind of work?
On a newspaper
Is it fun there?
It's okay
Tell me more
I won't be going...
So I'll just have to imagine it
What do you want to know?
How's the climate?
Pretty warm
All year round
Sometimes you can't tell
what season it is
The food stalls are great!
Ping and I ate there after work
We'd eat and drink till dawn
Our land lord was a funny man
Short and fat
and he always wore a skirt...
What the Malays call a 'sarong'
But when you're away from home
...it sometimes gets boring
That was a dull meal!
Another drink somewhere else?
You really Like to drink?
It makes things easy
When I'm drunk. I have no worries!
Won't your girl friends be
missing you tonight?
They're not stuck to me!
They see other men too
We just have fun together
They still need to make a living!
I don't get it
Where does all that fun get you?
If you find the right person...
...why waste time on the others?
If I find the right person!
A man Like me has nothing much
...except free time
That's why I need company
So people are just time-fillers to you?
I wouldn’t say that
Other people can borrow my time too
And this evening?
Are you borrowing me or am
I borrowing you?
No difference!
Maybe I borrowed you earlier...
...and now you're borrowing me
Ridiculous!
Don't get me wrong
I don't intend to take advantage
of you
If that was what I wanted...
...I had plenty of options
I just want us to be drinking pals
Is that okay?
It's hard
But I'll give it a try
Okay...
Let's try!
Where to? Let's drink!
Mr. Chow. you seem happy tonight!
I certainly am
my friends are buying me dinner
This way please...
Ping! Is it someone's birthday?
Better than that
Chow has a new girlfriend!
Definitely worth celebrating!
Mr. Chow. what would you
Like to eat tonight?
Something expensive!
Snake?
Yes. snake would be good
Snake isn't cheap
Can you afford it?
Sure you'll win the bet?
Shut up! Don't mind him
What'll it be
Mr. Chow? Snake!
And a lamb casserole too
And bring Hoi's whiskey
Yes! Good!
Can't Let this go to waste
it's delicious
Where's your girl. Chow?
It's already 2 a. m.
Is she coming?
She can't be coming
I don't think she's coming
It's all your fault
It's because of you
that this happened
Why blame me?
You brought this on yourself
You said she was gentle and obedient
Now we know the truth!
I said she was sometimes obedient...
...and sometimes gentle
But she's full of surprises
that's part of the fun
So. what next?
Yes. what now?
Whatever you feel Like doing
And then what happened?
Tell me!
How are you going to thank me?
Pervert!
Open up!
Who is it?
Open the door!
It's late
You played a fine joke
on me tonight
I finished work Late
Too Late to get there
So I didn't come
What's this?
That's your fault too
How could I know
you'd stand me up?
I thought I'd win a few hundred
Instead I lost my moustache
This is all your fault
You deserved it
Who pushed you into the bet?
I'll tell you something...
Ping asked me not to show up
Anyhow...
I wasn't that fond of
the moustache
You look younger now
Don't you Like it?
You're making fun of me!
You tricked me!
I'll get you for this
How will you make it up to me?
At least give me a kiss
You bit me!
Come and get me!
You're in for it when
I catch you!
Don't touch me there!
What?
What are you doing?
Shaving you Don't!
Who knows where that shaver's been?
It could bring me bad luck
Let's go for Round Two!
Why are you dressed?
I'm going back to my room...
I'm exhausted
This is all I have
Aside from loose change for the bus
Here's $200
Please take it
I don't want it
I wasn't selling
That's not how I meant it
I want to pay for
your torn dress
Please take it
I see...
You're afraid I'll cling to
you. is that it?
Fine...
I'll take $10
Think of it as a discount rate
If you ever want to come over again
...I'll charge the same
I'm going back to my room
Come here
Not tonight
Why not?
Not in the mood?
Can't take the strain tonight
Anyhow. I'm a bit short of cash
Never mind. you can owe me
No....
I don't Like being in debt
The reception's at 6. dinner at 8
I don't mind if you can't make it
just send your gift
No more than you do!
You hold banquets all year round!
I've had four birthday invitations
from you this year!
I'll send over some more
invitation cards later
Think of people with money...
Write in their names and send
them invitations!
Okay. that's settled
Mr. Chow. holding another banquet?
You know we have birthdays
indifferent calendars?
Another of mine has come around
No doubt
Here's one for your boss Alright
Tell him that since
we're so close...
He can deduct his gift from
the rent I owe
Make sure he gets it
Okay
It's Late. what's so urgent?
Just got back from Macau
Chow asked me to bring
you a present
You two went to Macau?
Yes. we had some days off
So we went to the casino
Oh. it's beautiful
He says he found some money...
...in his pocket
So before losing it all
at the tables...
...he bought you a present
Where is he?
Not back yet
You know what he's Like
Extravagant at
the start of the month
...and broke well before the end
He made several thousand
hosting that party
So now he's really
enjoying himself!
Is he there alone?
Of course not!
There's a gang of them
He likes company
Was he always Like this?
Let's not talk about him
Let’s have a drink
But I should warn you...
I know you Like Chow a lot
Don't waste your time on him
He's not serious!
Guess who?
There's only one possibility!
Let me have a bite first!
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What do you think?
I thought I was pretty wild
But you're much wilder!
Pay up!
I haven't seen you for ages
I've been busy
Liar
Tell me the truth
I am!
Who was that woman the other day?
What woman?
Don't pretend
I saw her leaving your room
Who is she?
A friend
A friend?
What was she doing in your room?
Don't be nosy. alright?
Go back to your room
I have work to do
I won't!
I'm sleeping here tonight
An overnight stay is expensive
No problem
Name your price
I'd pay anything to be with you
Every day
Retail is fine
Wholesale is out of the question
Why?
I just don't Like it
Could you make an exception for me?
No
You treat all women Like this?
Except one
Who?
My mother
I'm serious
I don't mind you having other women
But I won't be treated
the same as them
I don't care if you love me or not
I'II Love you anyway
Since we got together. I haven't
brought other men back
I hoped you'd think the same way
Will you promise me that?
No
I see...
Then we're through
I'll never bother you
And I don't ever want you in
my room again
Here. $10
Tonight. I'm paying
Thank you!
If you're ever in the mood
feel free to come over
I'll charge you the same
Having fun?
What do you care?
