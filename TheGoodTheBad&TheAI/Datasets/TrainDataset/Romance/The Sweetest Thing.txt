Christina Walters?
God, I haven't heard that name in ages.
The kind of womanwho can get any guy she wants,
That's Christina Walters.
We dated briefly,but she's not the commitment type.
She's a player. She just likes to have fun.
I met Christina at a bar. Hot piece of ass.
Totally hit it off. All night long we dance.I buy her drinks.
At the end of the night, she just splits.
I lay down all that groundwork for nothing.
She gave me her number. It's been three days.
I saw Swingeer. I know how these things work.
Hello, and welcome to AOL Moviefone,
I stay up nights trying to figure outwhy she said she'd call and didn't.
Maybe she wanted to call and that's whyshe said she was going to call, but...
"Christina"
"Christina"
Prolonged impotence is very commonafter a breakup.
Lots of men suffer from it.
They just don't talk about it.Not like me, gabbing away. Gab, gab.
But, even still,because she said she was going to call...
...she should've calledto say she wasn't going to call...
...and I would've thanked her for calling...
All right. Okay .
At least I don't get that dizzy,head-spinning nausea as much as I used to.
Hooray!
Like I said, I'm doing fine.
I am fan-fucking-tastic.
- Christina.- Valerie!
Shake it if you've got it.
Miss Courtney.
Hello, Miss Christina.How you doing? What you doing?
Dancing too much. How you doing?
Same thing. How was your day?
Pretty good.
I got a new account designinga campaign for a sports line.
They got the right girl, didn't they?
Thank you.
So, what's up?
The usual. Defending the rightsof my broken-hearted clients.
Trying to squeeze every pennyout of their miserable, cheating spouses.
You go get them, woman,
I'll order a pizza and stay in tonight.
Okay, but if we do that,you know what will have to happen.
Girl, I've been shaking my assall the way up this hill.
Which track?
Track three. Oh, yeah!
Koochie!
Is your granny here? What's going on?
It's Jane. She loves this song.
Jane, what's up?
He dumped me.
Kevin dumped me.
It was just three daysbefore our one-year anniversary.
- Baby.- Maybe he just freaked out.
He will call up tomorrow when he realizeswhat a huge mistake he made.
- He's probably going through that whole...- No.
He says he's been wanting this for six months.
He says he's been dying insideever since I brought over my garment bag.
- Honey.- What?
We're all guilty of it.You made yourself too available.
It's a classic mistake, sweetheart.
- Yeah.- Not according to this.
"Commandment four."
"True Love: The Ten Commandments."
"Commandment number four:Thou shalt be open to love's possibilities.
"Boundaries are the enemies of love."
Sweetie, you know what?This book is relationship propaganda.
Listen to me.
Dating is all about boundaries.
Honey, you have to protect yourself.
We've all had our heart stomped onone too many times...
...because we served it to themon a big old platter.
A good defence is the best offence.
I am so tired of playing games.
This is not about playing games.This is about self-preservation.
You can't throw yourself out thereall exposed and vulnerable every time.
That is how you get smacked down.
Do you understand?
Don't go looking for Mr. Right.Look for Mr. Right Now.
And, eventually, if he's worthy, then one day...
...that "now" part is just going to drop away.
Naturally, you know?
Meanwhile, you're justgoing to have fun together.
Yeah. Not so serious. Shake it off a little bit.
Speaking of fun, we are going to take you out.
We are taking you out.You are going to have a good time.
No.
Oswaldo!
Hey, Christina. Courtney.
- Jane.- Hello, Jane.
- Welcome.- Thank you.
Shut up!
- Right here, baby.- Oh, my God.
They can have her.
Look at the shoulder, baby.Bounce it, baby. Check it out, baby.
What's your name, baby?
Herewe go. Circle of love, circle of love!
We're going to go now.
Bye-bye.
My God. It's like Siegfried & Roy or something.
Martinis, ladies.
- Compliments of the gentleman at the bar.- Which one?
Thank you, Leather Coat Guy.
Cheers.
Leather Coat Guy is looking good.
Shotgun!
Cheater.
What's up?
Nothing. What's up with you?
Nothing.
What's up with you?
Nothing. What's up with you?
Nothing.
You know, I am having the best time.
Are you, sweetie?
My boyfriend dumped me. I'm at this clubwhere no one wants to talk to me.
- I want to go home.- No.
No. Christina, I can't do this.
Yes, you can. It's really very easy.
Observe.
I just pinched his ass.
I'm sorry. Hi.
- Hi. What's your name?- Peter.
Peter, this is my friend, Jane.Jane would love to dance.
I don't mean to be rude,but I have some friends waiting for me.
Nice to meet you, though.
- He hated me. I suck.- You don't suck. That guy was a dick.
I'll make sure that you have fun tonightif it's the last thing...
What did you call me?
You just called me a dick. I heard you.Why am I a dick?
Because I didn't like the wayyou treated my friend.
I didn't do anything to your friend.
You barely gave her the time of day.
You tried to pawn me off on her and I didn't go for it.
You should be so lucky to even talk to someone as hot and sweet as Jane.
Excuse me.
I wasn't suggesting you get married.I just thought you could get it on.
What? Get it on?
You know nothing about me.What if I'm some psycho serial killer?
What if Jane was the girl of your dreams,but you'll never know?
That is the sweetest thing.
I never thought I'd meet herby having somebody grab me and say:
"Man, I have good woman for you.She is very hot and sweet.
"Jane! Dance for the man!"
- Maybe that's your problem.- What?
Maybe if you didn't play it so safe,Mr. Safety-Poo...
...you might meet a girl you could have fun with.
This brilliant love advice comesfrom one who loves to play games with men.
Always in control.That way, she never has to get too close.
Nice manners, by the way.
Where the hell did that guy... Jane?
What's up with you?
Nothing. What's up with you?
I can't believe you grabbed his ass.
He comes right into my faceand starts telling me all this stupid stuff...
...about how I like to play gamesand be in control so I never get too close.
Can you believe him?
- What?- Nothing.
- I've never seen you act like this before.- Act like what?
They're fake.
All bah-jiggity about some guy.
- Bah-jiggity?- Yeah.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare.
It's cool. It's why I got them.
- I'm not bah-jiggity.- You are so bah-jiggity.
They look real.
Thank you. You can touch it if you want to.
No.
- Touch it. She likes it.- Go ahead. It feels real, huh?
If I'm bah-jiggity about this guy Peter,it's because you're telling me I am.
- Oh, my God.- What?
You've named the puppy.
- I did not.- You just called him Peter.
- I did?- You've got to feel these things.
I'm psychic and I knew his name was Peter.
- Knock your socks off.- So soft.
Un-fucking-believable.
Fuck.
I am so getting a pair.
That's why chicksalways go to the bathroom together.
It's so obvious that you like this guy.Why are you being such a pussy about it?
Why are you making such a big deal out of it?
If you haven't noticed,there's plenty of guys out there.
See you later.
- What's your problem?- What's your problem?
- Hi.- Hi.
Hey, Peter.
- Eric!- Be right there.
You don't have to do this.
I know, but I want to. I spilled your drink.Can I buy you another one?
Okay.
I want to apologize.
I shouldn't have been impolite to your friend.If I was, I didn't mean to.
My brother is waiting for meand I got nervous, I guess. I don't know.
I mean, otherwise, I'd be all over your friend.
I'm the one who should apologize. I was rude.
No, I understand. You were protectingyour friend. Anyone would've done that.
I thought that was sweet.
Jesus.
- We good now?- Yeah.
Good.
I should get back to my friends.
Okay.
Thanks for the drink.
- Cheers.- Cheers.
- Have a good night.- You, too.
Can you take this? I'm a total loser.I just struck out with this guy.
One more thing.
Should I be upset that my ex-girlfriendhas her tongue down that guy's throat?
Oh, my God!
- Jane!- I guess I blew my chance.
- That could have been you.- If I wasn't such a dick.
- Was I really a dick?- Yeah. You were a dick.
We should start over. Why don't I walk by,and you grab me like before?
- I didn't grab you.- You grabbed me.
You grabbed me right on the ass.
I don't grab, okay?
Pete!
Excuse me.
Dude! Where you been? Everybody's waiting.
After-hours party back at the hotel.These two pigs are good to go.
Did I mention that we have the Freddie Mercury Suite?
She puked on him!
Again? God, she's like a hose.Go help her, please.
Or not.
She's out. We're one short. Who's this chick?
- She is hot. Bring her.- What?
Fuck me. You have so much...
You've got to come. Let me tell you why.
You'll never find anyone better than my brother.He is the greatest...
That hurts me. Just look at him.
Chicks freak on this guy. Come on, now.
He is the shit and that's whyhe's in my wedding on Saturday.
- No.- Yes.
- No.- Just trying to help out.
'Bye!'
Ladies, big party. Four Seasons, room 402.You're invited, you're invited.
All right, I'm leaving.
- That's my brother.- He's special.
Careful, that's puke. Don't touch me.
When is the wedding?
Saturday afternoon up in Somerset.That's where we live.
That's nice.
Peter! It's looking like now.
You're pinching my arm skin.
I better go. But for real this time.
- It was nice to meet you.- Very nice to meet you. I had a great time.
Me, too.
Come by the party if you want to.
- Really?- Definitely. If you want to.
I'll ask my friends. Maybe we'll stop by.
I really hope I see you. But in caseI don't see you, have a nice life.
You, too.
Chris, it's CourtI'm at the party with Leather Coat Guy,
I was checking in to seeif you were listening to your messages,
If you are, tha tmeans you weretoo chicken to hook up with Peter,,,

"I'm a hig loser,"
What's up, you hitches and hos and loseer?
Too late now.
He was kind of cute.
Funny.
Really funny.
Cute boy.
My God, you're so good at that.
I'd like to do that every hour,on the hour, for the rest of our lives.
- Of course, go ahead.- Thank you.
Don't worry about returning the favour.Men don't really like oral sex.
Right.
I'm serious. It's just a bad rumourthat was started sometime in the '50s.
I had no idea. I need to tell all my friends.
Please, do.Someone needs to put an end to this madness.
God, I'm so glad I came back to the hotel room.
Me, too.
I never thought I'd see you again.
- Room service.- Right on time.
- Ice cream?- Only the best for our VIPs.
I had them remove all the calories for you.
You are good.
All right!
I said I wanted to do it to you every hour,on the hour, but I can't wait.
Can I do it agaln now?
Okay.
San Francisco, California, please,for Four Seasons Hotel. Thanks.
Great dream.
Yes, hi. Do you have a Freddie Mercury Suite?
Good. Can I have it? Thanks.
Really?
Already?
Have a great day. Thanks. Bye.
What am I even calling for?
Hello? Hey, Court.
Yeah.
- Stop talking shit about me.- Where you been?
Sorry I'm late. I don't want to talk about it.You ready? I'm starving.
I'll meet you there. I have to drop something offat the dry cleaners.
Can it wait, please? I'm so hungry right now.
Isn't that Courtney's dressthat you borrowed last night?
Yeah.
Why are you bringing it in?Did you get something on it?
I'm trying to be a good girlfriend.
- I'm really sorry.- You slut!
- Is that what I think it is?- Guilty!
I'll take it to the dry cleaners, and it will be gone.
- That's a lot!- He was holding a lot!
My God! What's this on your skirt?
I am scared enough as it is to go in there.What am I going to say?
"Mr. Martin, can you help me with my jizz?"
You know what?
- You guys suck.- No, obviously you suck.
- You suck.- You suck well. I'm proud.
No spanky-wanky.
Hey, Jane.
- Hi, Mr. Martin.- How's your mother?
- Great. She's good. Everyone's good.- Your grandmother?
- Everyone's great.- That's fine. That's fine.
What you got for me today?
Just a dress, but I'll be back for itin a few days, so no hurry.
- Any stains?- No.
- What's this?- What?
This. Come here.
Stain?
This is going to be a tough one.
I didn't even notice that. I must have spilledsome soda on me last night.
No. This is not soda. Think, Jane. Think.
If I know what it is, it's easier for me to remove.
The field trip. Come in, children. Come in.
- Fuck.- Good afternoon, Mrs. Franklin.
Hi, Mr. Martin.
On today's field trip,we are going to learn about cleanliness.
Jane?
Jane Burns!
Sweetheart, I haven't seen yousince I taught you in third grade!
- Top of the morning there, Mr. Martin.- Hello, Father Flynn.
As I live and breathe, isn't it...It is little Mary Jane Burns!
What a coincidence!I'm having supper with your parents tonight.
What a stain you got there, little Janie!
So how was it? Was it fun?
Oh, my God, I can't believe I didn't tell you this.
Apparently, one of the guyswho was at the party flipped out...
...was out on the balcony,screaming at the top of his lungs:
"Christina! Has anyone seenmy little Christina?"
Then he jumps off and diesbecause you're a pussy. Why didn't you go?
I don't know! I was going to. I was.I was going to, and then I wasn't.
And then I called him at the hotel...
Wait. Hold on. Rewind for one second.You called him at the hotel?
- What did he say?- Nothing. He said nothing. Okay?
- Why?- He checked out already.
Let's just sum this up real quickly.
In the bathroom, we hate him,yet we call him by name.
Then we throw beer on him.
Then we laugh and we flirtand we dance with him.
Then we casually call him at the hotel.Then we obsess about the casual call.
Obsess? I'm not obsessing, okay?
Could all this erratic behaviourbe because this guy got under your skin?
- No.- That you might really like him?
That you regret not going becauseyou'll never know what might've happened?
No, I don't regret it, and if I had any regrets...
...it would be this conversation,right now, having it with you.
- Can we drop it?- Okay. Sorry I brought it up.
I won't mention it again.
Even if I did regret not going to the party...
...it's not like I can do anything about it now.
Sometimes you just haveto let these things go, right?
- Exactly.- Although...
...if there was regret...
...I suppose there's always somethingyou could do about it.
You could show up at his brother's wedding,because it is his brother.
But that's only if you regretted it,which I don't regret it.
I just don't regret it.Regret is such a waste of time.
Honey will you just admitthat you regret not going to this party.
- Okay, fine I regret not going to this party.- You need to let it go.
I'm letting it go. I'm over it.
Hi, honey, how did it go?
- Fine. No problem.- Good.
Did we have fun last night?
Yes, I did. It was great.
You guys were right,a transition guy is what I needed.
Good.
So how was he, was he good?
He was very sweet and complimentary.
And very into pleasing me first.
So how was girth?
Averag-ish.
"Averag-ish." That's good.So what did you tell him?
What do you mean?
What do we always tell them, no matter what?
Oh, my God, your penis is so big.
Good girl.
Your penis is so thick.
Your penis is just so pretty.
You got a handsome dick!
Your penis, it's so...
...hard.
Your penis is just so large.
My body is a movie...
...and your penis is the star!
You're too big to fit in here.
Too big to fit in here.
Too big to fit in here.
"You're too big to fit in here"
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, it's Fame! We're in Fame right now.
"What a lovely ride
"Your penis is a thrill

- "Your penis has got a rhythm"- "Your penis makes me groove"
- "Your penis is a dream"- "The biggest one I've seen"
"It's oozy and it's green"
Sorry.
"You're too big to fit in here"
"You're too big to fit in here"
"Your penis is so big Your penis is so thick"
"Your penis is so pretty You got a handsome dick"
"Your penis is so hard Your penis is so large"
- "My body is a movie"- "And your penis is the star"
"Starring your penis"
"You're too big to fit in here"
- Come on.- How much time we got?
We've got three hours before the rehearsal.Hit the ball.
- Good shot.- Fore!
I'll shove that club up your ass, you dicklicker!
- What are you up by, two?- I guess.
It doesn't get any better than this.
- To the marriage.- To the marriage.
- To the bride.- To the bride.
To 50 years with the same woman.
That's really depressing.
Sorry.
Saggy tits.
Be able to use them as a belt by then.
- Or just tuck them in her socks.- Okay.
God, this marriage is such a big leap.It's really intense, Pete.
- But if it's the right  woman...- I guess.
Get up a little. Yes. Fore!
You motherfuckers! Stop bothering me!
You're driving right into them.
I hear John is still AWOLfrom that bachelor party.
He showed up, missing an eyebrow,with a tattoo on his ass that says "Bitch."
- I am not an animal!- Very good.
Speaking of bitches...
...what was going on with youat the club with that hottle?
- Nothing.- I mean, Jesus!
I don't know what you're talking about.
- I think you liked her.- No, I didn't.
Yeah, you did. Don't lie to me.
Don't lie. Don't lie to Darth, Luke.
I could see it in your eyes you liked her.
Nothing I can do about it now.
Should have poked her in the whiskerswhen you had the chance.
What's that, Gramps?
I met this hot young dish...
...at the World's Fair back in 1940.
Every moment with her was like a slice of heaven.
I bet you really miss Grandma.
Fuck Grandma.
It's Pearl I'm talking about.
She was the love of my life.Don't ever let these moments pass you by.
Fucking Grandma.
Be nice.
Come on. 7-6.
Fore!
You suck!
Damn it!
- But you smell so minty fresh now.- What do you want?
I need to borrow your black Gucci bag.
It's in the living room.
I don't know where in the living room,and I don't feel like looking for it.
Will you help me find it, please?Come on, please.
Since I'm up now,and you decided to torture me...
...I'll go and get it.
I'm sorry. Oh, my God. Excuse me.
Can you tell me where the bathroom is?
- Behind you.- Over here?
Thanks.
Oh, my...
...cock.
Oh, my cock.
Do you have any Advil?
He is so cute. So stupid.
Can I get that purse now, please?
Yes, you can have the purse.
Here's the purse.
Thank you very much.
- Where are you going?- You and I are going to a wedding.
- What wedding? Who's getting married?- We're going to Peter's brother's wedding.
Peter?
This Somerset place where they liveis some small freak-ass town...
...three hours north, so we have toget on the road now to make it on time.
- Peter.- What?
I'm not going to Peter's brother's wedding!
What are you talking about? Yesterday,you said you wanted to go, so I went...
- I was joking.- No, you weren't.
Yes, I was.
Fifty percent of what people saywhen they're joking is true.
Which means you do want to go,but you're too afraid to admit it.
So by making some sort of joke about it,you get to say what you really want...
...without being vulnerable.
- Right?- Maybe.
Okay. The wedding starts at 5:00.I refuse to be late.
Put some clothes on. Now! Thank you.
- That was a nice one.- Thanks.
- Watch the road, sweetie!- I am watching the road.
Once we get off the 140...
...we'll take the 95, get off on the Somerset exit.
We'll drive aroundand we should find the church, no problem.
Ta-da!
- What is that?- What is what?
- You don't smell that?- What? I don't smell anything.
- You're used to it. That's what's scary.- I don't smell anything.
It smells like mouldy ass,is what it smells like in here.
Come to think of it,I did leave some ass in the back.
- You did?- About a week ago.
It must be the ass. No, no. Sit down.
- What are you doing?- Jesus, Courtney.
What is all this crap?
Don't throw out anything I might need.
Where is it coming from? Where?I can still smell it.
Maybe it's you.Did something crawl up your poon-nonny?
I have never, ever had any complaintsin the poon-nonny odour department.
- You know what? Neither have I.- High five on the clean poon-nonny.
Bitch.
What?
- What is this?- What is what?
What is this?
Jesus, I don't know.I don't know how long it's been in here.
What is in here?
No! That is not okay.
It isn't okay. You are a disgusting,nasty pig. Do you understand?
There was maggots on that flesh.
I got maggot juice all over me.
Ladies' room.
Ladies' room.
- Someone's in here.- Sorry.
- It might be a while.- How long?
Let me put it to you this way:
I had lamb curry last nightand I'm shittlng out a Buick.
Was it absolutely vitalfor her to tell us that?
Was it absolutely vitalfor her to tell us that?
Hello?
Clear?
I feel like I have maggots all over me.
Don't move. You have a maggot right here.
Stop it.
I'm going to pee my pants.
I'll just use the urinal.
You want to hear some poetry?
"There once was a man from BandooWho fell asleep in a canoe"
"He dreamed of VenusAnd played with his penis"
"And woke up with a handful of goo"
Don't make me laugh!
Darn it. I think I peed on myself.
"Follow the yellow brick road"?
I'm following the yellow brick road.Follow the yellow brick road.
Buffy! You look like my old doggie Buffy.Hello, girl.
- Oh, my God, it's on my hands!- Good girl. What you got in here?
What you got? What's in your mouth?
What you got in there?
What's in there?
Surprise!
Goddamn it.
How could you not knowwhat a glory hole is?
Unlike my whore friendCourtney Rockliffe...
...I don't usually spend much timein men's public bathrooms.
Goddamn. That is the funniest thingI have ever seen in my entire life.
I flew across that room.And you got fucked in the eye.
I'm glad you find it so fucking amusing.I really do.
Could you please have some compassion?Because I could go blind.
You're not going to go blind.
- Let me look at it.- I mean, I got a penis in my eye.
Let me see. Let me see.
All right.
- Is it okay?- Yeah, it's okay.
But I think you're pregnant.
Would you please stop it, already?
Re-dress the mannequinsand check the sock inventory.
Come on, it's Saturday and nobody's here,and Mr. Mooney...
Mr. Mooney is off salling with his boytoy,which leaves me in charge of the store.
Somebody needs to get some.
There's my dirty girl!
It's me, baby. It's me.

You look so cute.
- I'm horny.- Me, too.
- You'll laugh at this one.- What?
You know I sald I had to do laundry today,because I ran out of clean underwear?

You are so unbelievable.
Is that what I think it is?

- Oh, my God! Brain.- Jane!
You and I are so awesome together.
We're like two peas in a pod.
- Like oil and vinegar...- Shut up.
I can't believe I'm fuckinga purple elephant.
What do you mean, she's not here?We have customers, missy.
Sorry, Mr. Mooney. I'll check upstairs.
I'm gone for one day,the place turns into Indonesia.
Jane?
- Are you okay?- I'm fine.
- What is going on?- Nothing.
I'm frantic. I've a million things to do.And I'm dizzy. I'm so dizzy.
Mr. Mooney is downstalrs,and he is P-I-S-E-D.
"Pised"?
- Where have you been?- I was upstalrs taking inventory.
Yeah, my aunt Fanny.
- Gallini's.-Hello, is Jane there?
- Yes, she is.-Have a lovely day,
- Hello?-Janie!
Sorry, I can't talk right now.I'm really busy.
We were wondering:
Shit.
Oh, shit.
I dropped the thingy to my lip gloss.Could you get it for me?
I'll get it.
It's too far over. I'll get it.
Hold on to it. Keep steering.
I got it. Don't worry.
Beneath the...
Yeah, baby!

You like that?
Yeah. Let me have some of that.

I found it.I almost got smothered down there.
Shit.
Are you okay?
- You good?- Yeah, I'm good. Never better.
Let's get on the same pageabout what we'll say. Game plan.
Walk up to him and be like,"Peter, is that you?"
"My friend Courtney, that hot babe?"She and I went to college with the bride.
"That is unbelievable.I can't believe that. It's unbelievable.
"Freaky."
Afternoon.
- Miss Vera's has plenty to offer us.- Plenty of crap.
- We don't have time for this.- Okay, let's go.
- Welcome to my store. Can I help you?- No, we were just browsing. Thank you.
You don't like my store, do you?
No, that's not it at all.It's really a lovely store.
We were looking for something...
The next dress store is 20 miles from here.
- We'll miss the wedding.- Judy Webb's wedding?
I know all about it.I dressed half the guests!
When I was 22...
...my breastices were,like, right about there.

You don't need to do a thing.

I've been trying to get us offthat mailing list since 1982.
Relax.
This is the hottest chick in this storeand I caught her trying to escape.
Very strange.
Sweetie, Christina, what's going on?What happened?
I came to just eat my cookieand make a phone call, but...
You didn't want to eat the cookies? What?
- Just read this.- All right.
"Commandment number nine:Thou shalt love what's possible."
Honey, we have gone over this.
You did not knowthe guy was getting married.
It's all right. He wasn't possible.
Not that one. The next one.Commandment ten.
- "Thou shalt not fear"?- Yes. "Thou shalt not fear."
What are you talking about, fear?
What you did was an incredibly brave thing.
You dropped all of your boundariesand you met this guy halfway.
More than halfway, you went to Somerset.
Guys, it was just another game. Come on.
If he hadn't been getting married,wasn't the groom, what would I've done?
That's right.
I would've done the same old thing.I would have hesitated. I would have...
...froze up.I would have kissed him and then ran off.
Give him the wrong phone number.
Hook that fishand just throw him right back.
Jesus.
I'm stuck in a rut.
Big, fat rut.
Guys, I don'twant to be that girl anymore.
- I know.- You know?
I know. None of us do.
Let's go dancing.
So, any chance?
Of what? No, don't even bother.She's on a mission.
- How is it shaking, ladies?- No, thank you.
Your body is banging. Your face is...
Neato. Thanks. Neat.
What's going on, hot mama?
Bringing it down. Bringing it up now!
Here it comes, baby. Feel the monkey.Work the monkey.
The monkey, the monkey, the monkey!
- You'reworking that monkey.- You're a really good dancer.
- You have some original moves.- Thanks, I've been working on it.
- Have we met before?- A couple of times.
I'm Donny.
Christina.
This is like Sixteen Candles.
I'd love to take you out sometime.
Really? Well, that's nice. I mean...
Give me your card, I'll call you sometime.
Thank you.
You seem like a really nice person.
- Work on the monkey.- I'll work on the monkey.
Hey, Donny.
- Do you have a pen?- You bet.
I'm a jerk and I wanted to apologize,because I didn't plan on calling you.
I'll give you my numberso that you can call me...
...because I found out somethingthat was completey life-changing:
It's okay to take a chance.
Love is crazy and that's what love is,it's taking a chance.
My girlfriend Courtney and Iwent on this crazy ride for a guy.
I went across the state, practically,to find this guy that I don't even know.
I don't even know you, but here I am,having this conversation with you.
And I know that if I just take a chancewith you, maybe, I don't know...
Forget it.
What's a guy got to do to get laid?
- Chris?- Yeah?
Honey?
What?
My God.
What am I going to do?
I think you can handle this oneon your own.
It's all good, girl.
Figure this one out. Figure it out. Okay.
Christina?
What are you doing here?
- I came here to apologize to you.- For what?
For not telling you I was getting married.
I should have told you that and I didn't.I'm sorry.
You're the guy that needs the last flingbefore your wedding.
No. I'm not that guy.
You spilled my drink and I let you buy mea beer. Tha twas all there was to it.
We had fun, we talked and that was it.
Right?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I didn't get married.
- What do you mean?- Judy and I, we called it off.
I hope my... That thing that happeneddidn't have anything to do with it.
No, it had nothing to do with that.
We realiezd we were doing the wrong thing.Two people should be in love.
But Judy is happy.She's scuba diving in Bali.
She really liked you, too.Why were you at my wedding?
It was just one of those spontaneous thingsmy girlfriend and I do.
It was just, really...
It just got screwed up.
I came here tonightbecause I wanted to see you.
I thought that maybe...
Well, that night that we met...
...I thought there was something,some feeling I had about us.
I thought that maybe you mightfeel that way, too.
Is this a mutual thing?This is not a mutual thing at all.
This is a very stupid thing. I'm stupid.
I should go.I really apologize for wasting your time.
And I'll go jump offthe Golden Gate Bridge now.
Thanks. See you.I'm stupid. That's right.
That's exactly what I wanted to do.
Yes. Gosh, it's going so well.
I'm not going to be afraid.
Peter?
Shit. Peter, wait!
Shit.
Come on!
Are you okay?
Yes.
I don't think I handled that too...
I didn't handle it at all. I'm so sorry.
I wanted to find youso that I could tell you...
...that I did come to your weddingbecause I wanted to see you again...
...because the feeling is mutual,and you better be a good kisser.
That was weak.
- Weak?- Yeah.
It's okay. You can try again.
You were so much better in my dream.
Hold these.
- I thought this was mutual.- Oh, my God.
I'm serious. I'll call you, okay?
What? Wait!
Thanks for the flowers. Nice touch.
I'm out of practice! I just woke up!
Unbelievable!
Christina Walters. Yep. I know her.
Bitch. Made my life a living hell.
She tries to pawn me off on her friend.She calls me a dick.
She hunts me down like a dogat my own wedding.
Then, when I try to apologize, she's like:
"I don't know you. You're one of hundreds.I have no feelings for you..."
Is that how I sound?
The movie is starting. Let's go!
Fuck Grandma.
Save yourself a buck.
- A girl that you lick.- Really?
- That you lick.- A girl that I lick?
Are you all right?
You'rewatching the credits?
- Chicks freak on this guy.- You ower me thirty...
Copy that.
Is that what you want?
I think there's always timefor a movie montage.
I hope you like how sexy I am.
Okay. I'm not going to be afraid.
I'm not.
It's a very bad rumour.It's a rumour. I'm serious.
Crap.
