- I'm gonna win!
- No-o...
This one's on me, well..
Look at the dolphins.
Mr Weston lived a life..
Was of great benefit to his community
and to his family.
And our hearts go out to Lil and Ian
at this time.
It turn out?
Yeah, well you know..
You give the people what they want..
I'm sorry but you know what?
I just never really got the point of that.
Well, I can't said that it was
a huge surprise..
Or I wouldn't take a drive with him
anywhere if I could avoid it.
He thought speed limits are for cowards.
The boys are taking it very hard.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Darling..
- Hey.
- Hey.
Where's mom?
With Lil.
I think you should take Ian down the beach.
Come on Ian,
do you want to go down to the beach?
Let's go.
Let's get our stuff.
Hey, you want to catch some blue crabs?
Yeah, sure.
God, Lil look at that..
Did we do that?
We must have been.
We certainly did.
They're beautiful.
They're like young gods.
Amazing.
Yeah.
We did alright.
You had a good day?
Right.
Are you hungry?
Starving.
Ravished.
We'll be there.
What is that?
I look like an angry boy.
With that chin.
That's horrible.
Oh yeah that one, yeah..
I'm pretty happy with that.
Yeah, it's nice but not in
the same league.
- Really? As those two?
- Yeah.
- No way.
- Right?
There's something about them.
- I don't know.
- It's like sort of an unearthly aura.
What's that?
They're looking at pictures of themselves
as nimfits..
They're admiring their own beauty.
Let's have a look.
- Hey!
- Give it back!
- Hold on.
- Wow, wow..
Come one, give us a break.
It was a long time ago.
Time flies, doesn't it?
I'll tell you though...
We may have been prettier then, but..
- I think we have much more character now.
- You know what? - Yeah.
- She might be right.
- Yeah, that's..
That's true.
Well..
Here's to our mothers.
Thank you, my darling.
- Come on, Tom. Give me a hand.
- Okay.
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'm fine mom.
Dinner's ready.
Remember that time when you had boobs
and I didn't? And I was..
Well, you soon made up for it.
It never stopped the boys from
buzzing around you, did it?
Yeah, but the boring jocks you never had
anything to say.
You had the interesting guys,
with long hair..
They wrote poetry and smoked the old..
Mine were just dull.
They still are, aren't they?
The good Saul.
Come on, he's not so much dull as..
He's just.. Persistent.
I want to know more about your boobs.
Well, it was quite serious and..
But Roz, she was very very comforting.
She used to say..
Don't worry, pop this in your bra
and they'll be coming along soon.
And so they were.
Right Tom,
I think that's enough on this topic.
I don't think it's entirely exhausted.
One queen.
And the king.
- Ace.
- Cheat.
It's your face.
It's always your face.
I don't want to play anymore,
I don't like it now.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- You're very late.
- It was a big day.
- In what way?
- I'll explain later.
If you're hungry,
we ate all of yours.
- Nah, there's plenty more in the kitchen.
- Now Roz..
My turn to shuffle.
I'm done.
Taking off.
Mom.
Early start.
Are you coming?
Well..
We're gonna watch a movie.
Alright.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Alright.
Good night.
Thanks boys for cleaning up.
Very nice..
- No worries.
- No worries.
Well?
I've been offered a job.
What?
Singing lecturer and drama
at Sidney University.
Sidney?
It's a great department.
It's quite a salary hike.
- Wow.
- Right?
Sounds like you want to take it.
Yeah, well..
Yes, I do.
Of course I do.
Yes.
And..
How would that work?
Would you fly back on the weekends?
No, I thought you and Tom
would come with me..
You mean move?
Move from here?
Yeah, I know it's not gonna be easy.
No.
Darling, opportunities like these certainly
don't come alnmg very often.
You must have applied for this job, Harold.
Yeah.
You never discussed it with me.
I didn't think I was gonna get it.
Not in a million years.
Roz?
Yeah?
Are you okay?
Should I close the door?
No.
Lil!
Hi, Saul.
- Oh Roz hi.
- Hi Saul.
Didn't see you there.
How are you?
What can I do for you?
Well, I took the liberty of organizing
a little surprise.
A celebration dinner tonight
at The Japanese.
Celebrating what?
My birthday.
Happy birthday, Saul.
Yeah, happy birthday.
But I can't tonight,
cause..
We've got the book club.
Really?
You couldn't skip it just once?
I wish I could.
I'm doing the food.
Oh, I see.
Maybe another night.
Yeah, another night.
- I'll give you a bell.
- Great.
Bye.
Book club?
You are really good liar.
Really good.
Okay, let's deal with it
one at a time.
You could get someone
to manage the gallery...
Or you could open a similar place
down in Sidney.
It's not as simple as that, Harold.
Yeah, agreed but for Tom?
And what he wants to do..
This isn't the place.
He's bound to take some
time to organized, you know?
Yeah.
But..
The point is that I need a wife..
Permanent wife.
You've got one, Harold.
I'm up for 20 years now, you know.
I do.
It's just I don't get to
see you much lately.
And when I do,
it's like you're on loan.
What?
I think it's Lil you don't want to leave.
Are you saying we're lesbians?
No, not that it'd make any difference.
You're just mad.
Of course I'm gonna come with you,
what do you think..
I just need time to get used to the idea,
that's all.
I don't know what he's talking about.
He says my real relationship
is isn't with him.
It's with you.
How can he think that?
I know..
We make him feel excluded.
Oh my god, that's how I always felt.
Even when Theo was alived,
with his..
Business trips and his girlfriends
ringing the house and his moods...
You don't know how much
I used to envy you guys.
He always seems so content.
Well, we were.
He's not saying we're lezos.
Not exactly.
Oh!
My hat!
Go on!
We're not lezos!
Are we?
I don't think so.
Not as far as I remember.
We're just best friends.
That's right.
Right.
I do remember that..
Time that you..
Well, it was..
Remember? That kiss?
Oh my God..
- But we had to practice on someone.
- Right.
Does it make us..
No..
- Bloody men!
- Bloody men.
You'll see, it's a much better
director's program down there.
I mean not to mention the standard
of teaching, once you get going.
That goes without saying.
- Alright.
- Alright.
- Look after her.
- Will do.
Don't try and be macho and drive
too many hours of that, rest okay?
I'm gonna miss you.
It's only a couple of weeks.
I didn't know you were out here.
Hey.
Mind if I join you?
Of course not.
Give us a drag.
You can have a whole one
if you promised to behave yourself.
A drag will do.
I didn't know you smoke.
I don't, I gave up years ago.
Now I feel really simple.
Nothing wrong with that.
How are you?
Fine.
You know, you're right.
You might have to said yes,
he's a well set out bloke..
No, it doesn't mean I
have to go out with him.
Can't he take a hint?
Evidently not.
I got a suggestion.
What?
Tell him to go fuck himself.
Supposed he doesn't know how.
Love this song.
Yeah.
That's the worst dancing
I've ever seen.
Can you dance?
I'm gonna slip away.
I think Tom's had a little bit
too much to drink.
Really?
Is he misbehaving?
No, he's fine.
But Ian's gonna stay over and
make sure he's alright.
Okay.
See you tomorrow.
Where's Tom?
Throwing up, I reckon.
Are you alright, mate?
Yeah, I'm fine.
- Need a hand?
- No, I'm alright.
Come on.
I said I'm alright.
that's fine.
Alright.
- I'll tuck you in.
- No fucking way.
Careful, careful.
Slow down.
- You're alright?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
It's alright,
we're good.
You have everything you need?
No.
Hi.
Hi.
I don't think he's here.
I didn't come to see Ian.
Oh.
You better come in.
I don't really wanna go to Sidney.
But Dad seems to have it all worked out.
I just don't..
Really see how I can get out of it.
Do you want to get out of it?
I don't really want to live here.
- No.
- No.
God no..
We'd really miss you.
And I'd miss you.
Tom!
Christ!
I'm sorry.
You really shouldn't have done that.
I know.
I mean, supposed Ian
had walked in or..
Is that all you're worried about?
No, I... I just...
Ian's otherways engaged..
What does that mean?
Means last night I went out to
the kitchen for a drink and...
Caught my mother coming out
of his bedroom.
- What?
- With her jeans in her hand.
It's not funny, Tom.
It's impossible.
She's known him since he was a baby.
They're probably been thinking about it
for quite a while.
Wouldn't you say?
- Are you coming?
- Not today.
- Are you alright?
- Fine.
You again.
Afraid so.
I don't really want to
go back there tonight.
Can I please stay here?
Yeah.
Yes, of course.
Hi. Where have you been?
At Lil's.
Doing to her what Ian's been doing to you.
We'll finished this later, okay?
I don't know, Lil what have we done?
Crossed the line.
It can't happen again.
No, no I supposed it can't.
No, of course it can't.
It's Roz who wants to stop.
She came to see me.
What did she say?
It doesn't matter, does it darling?
It's just obvious.
The whole thing is unacceptable.
I love her.
It's over, Ian.
no.
Please, don't.
You have to leave.
You have to leave.
How are you feeling?
Good.
Yeah..
Me too.
Yeah.
In fact, I..
I can't remember being this happy.
I know.
It's scary.
Very.
I don't want to stop.
I don't see why we have to.
I'm sure they'll get bored
of us soon enough.
Bound to.
Hey!
You're alright?
It's a long drive, but..
I got you an interview..
You'll be going down next week.
Great.
You've changed.
What?
What is it?
You got a girlfriend or something?
Something like that.
So, how're things in Sidney?
Yeah, it was alright.
And the Uni?
You like it?
Yeah, nice people.
I'm gonna miss that view..
The place is big..
It's very central,
lots of space.
You have a photograph?
Sure, I got plenty of them
in the laptop.
Let's see them.
I think this is what I'll miss the most.
The sound of it.
Sound of the sea.
Thanks a lot.
I mean apart from the personal things,
obviously.
What's the matter, darling?
What's the matter?
Are you worried about the move?
Well, yeah.
Is it because Tom's new girlfriend?
How do you know Tom
has a new girlfriend?
He just about admitted
that much to me..
But it's not really the place
to live by his education.
He's got a place right in front of him, one
of the finest drama faculty in the country.
Yeah, he knows that.
What is it then?
I've got this fantastic new job..
You don't side by me,
and I feel like an abandon ship.
Harold, we don't feel that at all.
You may not, but I do.
The house you found is great, Harold.
It's not that.
I don't think we're gonna be able
to come and live in it.
Why not?
What's the problem?
Tom and I had a long
talk the other day and...
Neither of us..
Can bear to leave here,
not for now.
You made your mindup?
Yeah.
It's got something to do with Lil, huh?
No, it's not of the reasons
you think, Harold...
I can't even explain it,
it's just I..
Boils down to one simple fact, is that
we can't imagine living anywhere else.
I don't understand.
No, I'm not sure I do.
If this fucking house means more to you
than I do..
Harold..
I'm sorry.
I really..
I really am.
I gotta get rid of Saul.
He keeps hanging around.
He might catch us out,
or something.
He just need to see us all together,
out and about.
Ever so often,
that's all it takes.
Yeah.
I wonder why his wife left him.
It's never a good sign, is it?
I'll fucking kill you!
Oh my god.
Roz! They're trying to kill each other!
You're fucking coward.
I'm not..
You're out of the line.
Come on.
Hi Saul.
Are you alright?
Just got caught on the rocks.
It looks nasty,
you might want a tetanus shot.
That's alright, we'll just put some
anticeptic on it. It'll be fine.
We'll see you, Saul.
Where are you going?
To your room.
Ian!
Consider it yours.
Lil.
Hi.
- Hi, Saul.
- What are you doing?
Roz.
Harold's not with you?
No, he's back in Sidney.
Didn't stay long.
Had to get back to work.
This isn't exactly what I had in mind.
I wasn't expecting to see you here, Roz.
Oo..
If you'd rather be alone that's fine.
No.. No..
- Tea?
- No, I'm fine.
Anyway, I can say what I want to say
in front of Roz.
Lil, I think you know how I feel about you.
I'm in love with you.
I've been in love with you for a while.
And I just thought this might be the moment
where we could discuss our relationship.
I know this is the last thing in the world
you want to hear, so..
But I don't think it's going to work..
I'm asking Lil.
But she's already told you.
I think you're gonna have to take no
for an answer.
Yeah Roz, but I want to hear it from Lil.
Don't you think it'd be better
for the bloke?
I mean both of you.
Two beautiful women like you.
My god.
You must think I'm a fucking idiot.
So that's it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I must have given you
a really big laugh.
I'm so sorry.
Saul..
Oh my god..
Did you just figure that out?
You need to be quicker on the line.
- He's gonna tell everyone.
- It's okay, it's probably for the best.
Bastard..
You're going in!
I know that, I don't care if having them
made in China is gonna save us 60%.
Alright.
Alright.
We're gonna have to decide
in the next week or two.
Okay, I'll think about it.
I'll talk to you again
on Monday.
You're alright if I take off now?
I promised to pick up Tom.
Fine.
- See you in the morning, Mr Weston.
- Bye.
Mother, did you not say
to me a little while ago...
That there was nothing in the world that
you would not do for me, if I asked you.
Indeed I did so.
And you'll stick to it, mother?
You may rely on it, my dear and only boy.
I have nothing in the world,
but only you to live along..
Very well.
And I shall hear..
Mother you have a strong and sted-fast mind,
in know.
But now..
Did I say you could invite your mate
to wander in the reharsal?
Sorry, I just..
This is a private work space.
Not fucking movie on a Saturday morning.
I wouldn't have a problem with the guy,
if he was a good director..
But he's just such a
fucking wanker, you know?
If he was a good director,
he wouldn't need to throw his wait around.
Yeah.
Hey, dad's offering me a production
down in Sidney. -Oh yeah?
Yeah, the George Gershman story
with second years.
You should take it.
I have to be away for at least a month.
- So?
- What about Lil?
She'll be fine. She wouldn't want you
to miss an opportunity because of her.
You think?
Absolutely.
Thank you.
Can I do that again?
Why? It was very good.
I can do it better.
Hello?
Hi, darling.
No, it's fine. We were just about
to eat, but Roz's come here.
So, how's it all going?
Yeah?
Rehearsals are going well?
Yeah.
The girl playing Roxie is very very good.
She's a really strong performer and..
Seems like she's got quite of potential.
And you're happy?
Yeah, I'm very comfortable.
It's been great to get to know
dad's new family and..
He seems very settled.
That's great.
If you guys are about to eat dinner..
Maybe I should call you back.
In an hour or two?
Okay.
Give my love to the others.
And to you.
Love you.
He seems very taken with
the girl playing Roxie.
Lil, come on.
I'm sure she's very taken with him too.
If he was taken with her,
I don't think he would've mentioned her.
- Right?
- Exactly.
No.
He thinks she's going to be a big star.
There's no where near because..
This big bat.. Was into a..
- You want a drink?
- Love one.
Here.
Thanks.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Yeah, what?
Are you gay?
I'm afraid not.
I heard really good reports coming out
of the reharsal room.
Happy to hear it.
Look at you, Dad.
So everything worked out for the best.
Everything just works
out the way it's gonna..
We just plot along behind it and
try and keep up.
You're not still angry with mom, are you?
God no, no..
You know?
Soon enough I won't let
you see me like this.
I don't you to even think about getting old.
That'll happen whether
I think about it or not.
No.
I won't let it.
You can't stop it, Ian.
It's going to happen.
Please.
Okay, I won't get old.
Will that do you?
Yeah.
You're crazy.
You are crazy.
Come on, it's not me.
I'm not.
Yeah..
I really think we should go home.
I think we should hit the road.
No way, come one.
One more, one more for the road.
COme on, please..
Alright, I'll get them.
No, I'll get them.
My shot, my idea.
Get out of the way,
I'm driving.
- Guess what? I'm not. Tequila for you?
- No.
I've never seen her like this.
She's panicking.
Hi, could I get a 2 gin and tonics
and a beer?
And a tequila shot please?
I'll pay for those, mate.
What?
What's your name?
- I'm Lil.
- Hi Lil.
- Thanks.
- I'm Richard.
Hi.. Nice to meet you.
- Well, what do you know? Chivalry's
not dead. - I'm so proud of it.
You need a hand?
No, I'm okay.
This..
Lovely gentleman seems to
want to buy us the drinks.
- That's alright.
- Who are you?
I'm her son.
Thanks.
Well, no harm done, sonny.
You better run along now.
That's what you called a buzzkill.
I assure you, I had him when I was 3.
Hey, what's the matter?
Nothing, I was having fun.
I don't know why you had to go and
stick your beating, he was a good bloke.
Mom.
- Bye.
- I'll see you.
Bye.
At some point, I gotta learn
to live my own life.
Two days, mom.
- He's back in two days.
- I know.
Are you coming in?
Just for a few minutes.
Roz's expecting you?
I think so.
Come on.
Don't let me keep you, darling.
I'll stay as long as you like.
Everything's gonna be fine,
I promise.
Very nice.
Are you hungry? Ready for yum-yums?
I don't see why you have to rush off
in such a hurry.
Stick around for a few days and
enjoy your triumph.
Stay for the weekend, at least.
No, I've got to get back.
You got a girl waiting, is that it?
Not a girl.
Just some stuff I gotta do.
I'm coming up to you 21st.
If I'm still working up there, that is.
Don't be stupid.
I'll wired the set.
Cater the door,
all that stuff.
What are you reckon, Dad?
Is the door worth opening?
It's gonna open anyway,
so you might as well walk through
there with a big smile on your face.
God, you're beautiful.
So do you want to do another musical?
I rather do a play next.
Something contemporary.
Sounds like a good idea.
But the fact of the matter is,
for the next few years..
I just have to take whatever
I get offered.
I don't really have a choice.
I'll get it.
Hello?
Hi.
Yeah, of course I was expecting you.
Yeah, I'm good.
Yeah.
What happened?
Hi Harold.
Where are you going?
Roz.
- Hi.
- Hi.
This is Mary.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Roz.
- Welcome.
- Thanks.
Her baby was teething, greaseling along,
Molly thought she'd stay behind..
And I thought I'd bring the
birthday boy a nice surprise.
Nothing like a nice surprise.
It's great.
- Cheers.
- Cheers, darling.
Mary. This is Lil and Ian.
Hi, I've heard so much about you.
I wish I could say the same
but Tom's a bit of a secret bugger.
Would you like to dance?
Sure, thanks.
Happy birthday.
Thanks, man.
Come on, Harold.
- Come, indulge me.
- No, Roz.
- Come on.
- Please.
She's staying in a hotel.
I could drop her home
and then come by.
If you want.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Coming in?
I don't know.
Don't you want your extra
special birthday present?
Yeah, of course.
I think this is what
we've been dreading, Lil.
We have to bow out.
Lil..
I don't know if I could bear it.
I know.
We have to.
I have to, you don't.
Ian doesn't have a girlfriend.
I know, but he should have.
Shouldn't he?
Yeah.
I supposed he should.
We have to stand together.
Okay?
- Yeah.
- And put an end to it.
Yeah.
We just have to.
I know we do.
I don't see why what Tom gets up to
has anything to do with us.
- I'm not getting married.
- Who says I'm getting married?
Then, I'm not doing whatever
it is you're doing.
Fucking someone else, I'm not doing that.
I have no intention of doing that.
All right, Ian, that's enough.
It doesn't matter.
This has gone on long enough.
Why can't you leave things as they are?
It's all going to be fine.
We're going to be respectable..
Pillars of the community
from here on end.
And we'll be model mothers-in-laws..
And before you know it,
we'll be the perfect grandmothers.
I will never forgive you for this.
I'm so sorry.
No, darling.
It's going to happen soon or later.
And responsibly and joyfully..
In mutual respect
and the promise to be faithful..
Come together in the
presence of God..
To witness the marriage
of Tom and Marry.
And to ask God's blessing on them
as we shared their joy.
Marriage is a gift from God,
our creator.
It is a symbol of God's
unending love for his people..
and of the union between
Christ and His church.
Christ loved his bride, the church.
And gave Himself away.
As He has called Tom
and Mary to marriage..
So He draws their different
gifts and hopes.
Into the unity of love and service.
Relax, it'll be your turn next.
Yeah?
Many good things about being married.
You're the one to blame
for this, aren't you?
I thought you were supposed to praise
the fairy godmother.
Not blame them.
Yeah, don't wave your
fucking wand over me.
Hello.
Nice to see you again.
You look lovely.
Hi, can I get a champagne?
Thank you.
Hey, hey..
Are you alright?
Fine, why?
You're just..
You seem a bit mirage,
that's all.
No, just occassions like
these make you think..
I hope they do better than us.
Don't you?
Yeah, of course.
Just wondering.
Where's mom?
She went home.
Want to talk?
If you like.
I don't like.
Why did you want to ruin everything?
I didn't want to.
Roz.
Roz, are you there?
Roz, let me in.
Roz?
Roz!
Let me in!
It's just up here on the right.
I think he's still sleeping.
Wait, you go in.
I'll wait.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, he might not want to see me.
If he does, come get me.
Alright.
Hi, darling.
Hey.
How are you feeling?
Doctor said you'll live.
Do they have any good news?
Roz is here.
She'd love to see you.
- No. - Darling, she's...
- No.
Hi.
Hi.
That's good.
I'm better than those fucking crutches.
I can get you some softer ones.
I don't know why I bother.
They say your spine is gonna be okay,
so that's good, right?
Yeah, only a comparison to what
they're telling me about my leg.
Just a bit left.
Roz?
Hey..
What?
You were calling out for Roz.
Huh?
Were you dreaming about her?
I guess so.
It's not surprising, really.
I've known her my whole life.
She's been like..
Second mother to me.
What would I do without you?
Shouldn't you be moving to Sidney?
I like it here.
I know, but..
I have to travel where the work is..
Mary's the same, so we can
base ourselves where we like.
- Where is she now?
- Audition.
How's it going with Hannah?
It's going..
Nowhere.
She's great.
She couldn't be nicer, I just..
- You know.
- Yeah.
Pretty soon I'm gonna
have to give her the over.
- Hello.
- Hi.
What are you doing here?
I didn't want to tell you over the phone.
Tell me what?
I'm pregnant.
Hey..
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
I think you don't need this anymore..
You're gonna be able
to do it all by yourself.
I know you will, ready?
Off you go.
Take your glasses off.
i don't like you hiding
your eyes from me.
Don't go in the water by yourself.
What's going on?
She's going to the water again.
You've frighten her.
- Can't you see she's frighten?
- I want my granny!
Is this your hat?
- Yeah..
- It's my hat.
I don't think I have any plain bread.
Red and white.
Finish them all.
Those were the best ones.
You've probably have had
enough sun for one day.
That's okay, I'll take them up
in a minute.
That's alright, I'll do it.
Come on.
Sweety..
Why are we leaving?
No no no..
Take the lolly.
Granny!
That's alright.
Where's my granny?
You got them over excited.
No, we spoil them, it's what we do.
It's what grandmothers supposed to do.
You two are really pleased
with yourselves, aren't you?
At our beach, at our magic beach..
The old bed is cozy and white..
To the sound of the ocean,
we sleep through the night.
Adrift on the evening tide.
That's it.
Night night..
I'm exhausted, you don't mind
if I skip dinner, do you?
No, I will miss you.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.
Sweet dreams.
Night night, guys.
So how long are you
guys on the road for?
I think I'm not more than 6 weeks,
and you got back on..
Wednesday.
I can't believe the breaks
come by so fast.
Will I see you before you go?
- Yeah, I hope so.
- Good.
- See you.
- Night.
Bye.
Bye, guys.
- Bye, love.
- Bye mom.
No, it's great.
The only problem is now that
they built my part more and more,
learning the lines everyday.
It's murder.
Ken Pierce, he plays my dad,
they had to..
Do this storyline about
him going deaf so they
can give him an earpiece
and read him his lines.
Ah, so that's why he looks
so bewildered all the time.
I think he's pretty bewildered
at the best of times.
Why don't you all drive back to
the hotel together? Ian can drive.
Why is that?
- I think you've had a bit of drink.
- I'm alright.
You must be over the limit, Tom.
Yeah, probably.
Alright, I'll go for a walk
and sober up a bit.
- No, I'll drive.
- That's fine.
You stay and chat,
I'm gonna get a breath of fresh air.
Do you girls want to go
shopping tomorrow?
- That sounds good.
- Go to that dress shop.
Great idea.
I want to speak to you,
in private.
- Ian..
- Now!
I'll kill him!
They really took you for a ride,
didn't they?
You're telling me you never
even suspected them?
How could you have
been so stupid?
You made a stop when
we didn't have to.
And all the time they,
Tom who was getting married.
For fuck sake, and should have stopped,
they were just stringing you along,
they were just pretending..
And having sex whenever they felt like it,
and laughing at us behind our backs.
And you're saying you had no idea
what was going on? -That's enough.
- Ian, we are not alone.
- What difference does it make?
Ian, what are you taking about?
I just walked across the
street and found your
- husband rolling around on the floor
with my mother. - What?
- You heard me.
- Ian..
Don't fucking Ian me..
As far as I'm concerned..
This is all your fault.
How could it be her fault?
Don't you see, Hannah?
They're lovers as well.
Ian?
It's not true, is it?
Not anymore.
She put a stop to it.
I don't understand.
It couldn't be simpler.
My husband has betrayed me.
Lied to me from day one.
I'm gonna go and get Alice.
And leave and I never want
to see any of you ever again.
If you have any sense,
you'll come with me.
Go on, then.
Well I hope you're pleased with yourself.
I just told the truth.
That's all.
That's all?
And you think that's something
to be proud of?
Somebody had to.
No! Nobody had to unless they wanted to
cause as much damage as possible, Ian.
Especially to Hannah.
It wasn't going anywhere anyway.
Probably best to make it quick and..
Merciful?
Is that your idea of merciful?
- Granny..
- Don't you touch her.
Granny..
You're worse than he is, you know that?
Tell Tom to stay away.
I don't wanna see him.
I'll tell him.
Bye-bye sweety.
I don't think they're coming back.
We did try, Roz.
We really did,
we stopped the same time you did.
We thought that was that.
And then..
We started it again just..
A few weeks after the wedding.
Mary was away auditioning and..
Tom dropped by.
The way he always did.
And it just sort of happened.
I didn't tell you because I thought..
It wasn't gonna last.
And then once we both realized it..
Roz..
It's just seem too late to tell you.
Too hurtful.
After the way you sacrificed Ian.
And Tom really didn't
want me to tell you.
Because it was..
It was so..
Casual, you know?
Sometimes we went weeks
without it, months..
It was just..
It was just important for us to
know that it hadn't gone away.
That it was still alive.
Christ, I felt like I would
suffocate if didn't have it.
Then it was only possible with
Tom because he's so lite, so easy.
It couldn't worked that way with Ian.
Ian told me it was all my fault.
Oh for God sake, he doesn't
know what's he talking about.
You were the only one who
hasn't behaved badly.
Then it probably is all my fault.
Oh Roz.
Morning.
