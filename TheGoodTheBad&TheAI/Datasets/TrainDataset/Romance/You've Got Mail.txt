FRANK:
Amazing. This is amazing!
Listen to this:
The entire work force of Virginia...
...had Solitaire removed
from their computers...
...because they hadn't done
any work in six weeks.
- That's so sad.
- Do you know what this is?
What we're seeing here is the end of
Western civilization as we know it.
Oh. Hey, aren't you late?
Technology. Name me one thing
that we've gained from technology.
KATHLEEN:
Electricity.
That's one. You think this machine's
your friend, but it's not.
- I'm out of here.
- See you tonight.
- Sushi!
- Sushi!
Bye!
MALE AOL VOICE:
"Brinkley is my dog. He loves the streets
of New York as much as I do."
JOE:
PATRICIA:
I'm almost ready.
JOE:
PATRICIA: - Did you push it?
- Yeah.
Yes, I pushed it.
I'm so late.
Random House fired Dick Atkins.
Good riddance.
Murray Chilton died. That's one
less person I'm not speaking to.
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Uch!
Vince got a great review.
He'll be insufferable.
Tonight, PEN dinner.
- Am I going?
- Joe Fox, you promised.
It's black-tie.
- Ohh...
- Can't I just give money instead?
What is it this week?
"Free Albanian writers"?
I'm in favor of that.
PATRICIA:
Ohh. Ohh.
Okay, I'll go. I'll go. You're late.
I know, I know.
MAN:
Good morning, Miss Eden.
Who's a happy dog?
Who's a happy dog?
MALE AOL VOICE:
- Welcome.
-
- You've got mail.
All right. Okay.
Get down, get down.
KATHLEEN:
KEVIN:
So he's not gonna be here
till tomorrow.
And upstairs, the shelves are late...
...because the pine
we ordered has beetles.
JOE:
Very good, very good.
And we got a $50,000 ticket for
construction workers peeing off the roof.
Great. That is great.
Is the electrician here?
I just told you he hit a deer.
I knew you weren't listening to me.
You're right. I wasn't.
"I hear nothing.
Not a sound on the city streets,
just the beat of my own heart."
I think that's how it goes.
Something like that.
You and Patricia got engaged,
didn't you? You can tell me.
- Engaged?
KEVIN: - Come on.
Are you crazy?
I thought you liked Patricia.
I do. I do. I love Patricia.
I love Patricia.
Patricia is... Patricia's amazing.
She makes coffee nervous.
We should announce ourselves
to the neighborhood.
Let them know, here we come.
This is the Upper West Side.
We might as well tell them
we're opening a crack house.
They're going to hate us.
They're gonna be lining up...
BOTH:
To picket the big, bad chain store...
That's out to destroy...
Everything they hold dear.
We're going to seduce them
with our square footage...
...and our discounts
and our deep armchairs...
BOTH:
And our cappuccino.
They're going to hate us
at the beginning...
BOTH:
But we'll get them in the end.
- And you know why?
- Why?
Because we're gonna sell them cheap
books and legal addictive stimulants.
In the meantime,
we'll just put up a big sign:
"Coming soon, a Fox Books Superstore.
The end of civilization...
KATHLEEN:
Good morning, Christina.
CHRISTINA:
Morning, Kathleen.
KATHLEEN: It's a beautiful day.
Isn't it just the most beautiful day?
CHRISTINA:
I guess. Yeah, sure.
DRIVER 1: Idiot, what are you doing?
DRIVER 2: I got the green light!
Don't you just love
New York in the fall?
Perfect.
Mmm. Can't beat that.
Scotch tape?
What is going on with you?
Nothing.
- You're in love.
- In love? No.
Oh, yes, that's right!
I'm in love with Frank.
I'm practically living with Frank. Hmm.
Do you think you could get our
Christmas mailers out this week?
Yeah, by Monday, I promise.
I have this paper due Friday.
What is going on?
Nothing, nothing. Nothing at all.
You know, I am just going to
stand here until you tell me.
All right.
Is it infidelity if you're involved
with someone on e-mail?
Have you had sex?
No, I don't even know him.
- I mean cybersex.
- No.
Well, don't do it. The minute you do,
they lose all respect for you.
Well, it's not like that.
We just e-mail.
It's really nothing.
On top of which, I'm thinking of
stopping because it's getting...
out of hand?
Confusing.
But not. Because it's nothing.
Where'd you meet him?
Listen, I can't even remember.
On my birthday, I wandered into
the "over 30" room for a joke, sort of.
And he was there.
And we started chatting.
About what?
Books and music,
how much we both love New York...
Harmless, harmless.
Meaningless.
Bouquets of sharpened pencils. Oh.
Excuse me?
Forget it.
We don't talk about anything personal,
so I don't know his name...
...or what he does
or where he lives exactly...
...so it'll be easy for me to stop
seeing him, because I'm not.
He could be the next person
to walk into the store.
I know.
CHRISTINA:
He could be...
...George.
Morning.
Are you online?
GEORGE:
As far as I'm concerned...
...the Internet is just another way
of being rejected by a woman.
Good morning.
Good morning, Birdie.
What are you girls talking about?
Cybersex.
I tried to have cybersex once,
but I kept getting a busy signal.
I know.
I was really depressed
one Saturday night about 9:00...
BIRDIE:
Time to open up!
Jessica and Maya, how are you today?
MOTHER: Want to say hi to Kathleen?
MAYA: Hi, Kathleen.
GEORGE:
Good morning, Shop Around the Corner.
George speaking. May I help you?
Construction's going well.
We should open on time.
Although Kevin and I are concerned
about the neighborhood response.
This fabric on the couch,
what is it? Does it have a name?
NELSON: Money.
JOE: Huh?
- Its name is "Money."
JOE: - Oh.
- Gillian selected it.
- Good guess.
- Your father's getting married again.
- Really?
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.
- Why?
- Who knows?
- Love?
- Possible.
I think you're a damn fool.
NELSON:
Pops, Matthew is 4 years old, okay?
It'd be nice if his parents were married.
Listen, I have a
sad announcement to make.
City Books, on 23rd Street?
It's going under.
Aww. Another independent
bites the dust.
On to the next!
Going to buy out their entire
inventory of architecture...
...and New York history
for the new store.
How much, son?
How much you paying?
JOE: Whatever it costs,
it won't be as much...
...as that uncomfortable
mohair episode there...
...which is now all over my suit.
Here you go.
Thanks.
We'll also have a section dedicated to
writers who've lived on the West Side.
SCHUYLER:
As a sop to the neighborhood.
Perfect. Keep those West Side,
liberal nuts, pseudo-intellectual...
Readers, Dad.
They're called readers.
Don't do that, son.
Don't romanticize them.
It'll keep them from jumping
down your throat.
SCHUYLER:
What's the competition?
One mystery store, Sleuth,
at 78th and Amsterdam...
...and a children's bookstore,
Shop Around the Corner.
- It's been there forever.
- Cecilia's store.
Who's that?
Cecilia Kelly.
Lovely woman. I think we might
have had a date once.
Or maybe we just exchanged letters.
You wrote her letters?
Mail. It was called mail.
NELSON: - Stamps, envelopes...
- I've heard of it.
Cecilia had beautiful penmanship.
She was too young for me...
...but she was enchanting.
- Enchanting?
- Her daughter owns it now.
Huh. Too bad for her.
Ah.
MAN: - Excuse me, Mr. Fox.
- Yeah.
JOE:
Is it porcelain?
Rubber.
KATHLEEN: Once I read a story about a
butterfly in the subway, and today...
JOE:
KATHLEEN:
Pride and Prejudice
JOE:
Mocha frappuccino grande.
JOE:
EMPLOYEE:
Tall, skim, caramel macchiato.
JOE:
Tall, decaf cappuccino.
GEORGE:
Bummer!
A Fox Books superstore.
nightmare.
It has nothing to do with us.
It's big, impersonal...
...overstocked and full
of ignorant salespeople.
But they discount.
But they don't provide any service.
We do.
KATHLEEN:
...it's a good development.
You know how in the flower district
there are all those shops...
...so you can find whatever you want?
This is going to be the book district.
If they don't have it, we do.
And vice versa.
Absolutely.
FRANK: When you are finished
with Fox Books...
...The Shop Around the Corner
is gonna be responsible...
...for reversing the entire course
of the Industrial Revolution.
Well, now, that is so sweet.
Frank!
Thank you. That is so sweet.
- Although l...
- What?
Wait a minute.
What is that doing here?
Oh! Oh, my gosh!
This is amazing.
Listen.
The Olympia Report Deluxe electric.
Report.
As in gunshot.
- That sound is familiar.
- Listen to this.
What, that whirring?
The gentle, soothing lullaby...
...of a piece of machinery so perfect...
I know where
I've heard that before, Frank.
I needed a backup.
Don't you have another one
at your apartment?
- I might.
- That you wrote a column about?
Yes. Who cares?
What were you gonna say?
- When?
- Before.
- Nothing.
- Come on.
Well, I'm just wondering.
I'm wondering about my work. I'm just...
What is it that I do, exactly?
All I really do is...
FRANK:
All you really do...
...is this incredibly noble thing.
- I don't know. Really, I'm just...
- Kathleen!
You are a lone reed.
You are a lone...
...reed...
...standing...
...tall...
...waving boldly...
...in the corrupt sands...
...of commerce.
- I am a lone reed.
- Lone reed.
I am a lone reed.
KATHLEEN:
ANNABEL: Hey, Joe!
MATTHEW: Hello, Joe.
JOE:
Hey! I know you!
I know you.
Hello, Annabel, little girl.
ANNABEL: - Hi.
- How are you?
And you!
- Matthew, how are you?
MATTHEW: - Good.
Good.
Ready to say hello to New Jersey?
ALL:
Hello, New Jersey!
Don't I get a hello?
Hello, Gillian.
Kiss me. I'm gonna be
your wicked stepmother.
There you go.
Hello. And who is this?
Nanny Maureen. I brought her in case
you couldn't handle the kids.
Maureen's getting a divorce.
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.
It's my own fault.
Never marry a man who lies.
That is so wise.
Annabel, remember that.
She taught Matt to spell his name.
Really?
- Let's hear it.
- F-O-X.
Excellent!
Excellent. I've got this covered.
You can have the day off.
And you must be late for something.
Volunteering, rolling bandages...
...for Bosnian refugees.
I am. I'm having
my eggs harvested.
And getting those eggs harvested.
Don't worry! See you later.
- Bye, Maureen! Bye, Gillian!
- Bye!
MATTHEW:
Bye, Mom.
All right, you guys, are you ready
to go out on the boat?
- No!
- No!
What happened to you?
What happened?
Come on, one more time.
Here, you can do that one.
Hey!
What do we win?
Look, look, look!
- Oh!
- Yay!
ANNABEL: - How are the fish doing?
- Very well, I think they're very happy.
- Are they?
- Yes.
You guys want to go to a movie?
ANNABEL:
No, there's nothing good playing.
Look! A storybook lady.
Are we at the right time?
Yeah, let's go.
"That it was I and I alone...
...who had the idea for
the great and daring mouse plot.
We all have our moments
of brilliance and glory...
...and this was mine.
'Why don't we, ' I said...
...'slip it into one of
Mrs. Pratchett's jars of sweets?
And then...
...when she puts her dirty hand in
to grab a handful...
...she will grab a stinky
dead mouse instead.'
The other four stared at me in wonder.
Then, as the sheer genius
of the plot began to sink in...
...they all started grinning.
They slapped me on the back, cheered
me and danced around the classroom.
'We will do it today! ' they cried.
'We'll do it on the way home.
You had the idea, ' they said to me.
'So you can be the one who
puts the mouse in the jar."'
GEORGE: - Uh, who belongs to this fish?
- That's mine.
Could you give me a hand
with these used books?
And this is her best friend Tacy,
whose real name is Anastasia.
And the next book, Betsy and Tacy
become friends with Tib...
...whose real name, I am sorry
to tell you, is Thelma.
ANNABEL:
Ew.
The illustrations are hand-tipped.
And that's why it costs so much?
That's why it's worth so much.
ANNABEL:
I want all of them.
Uh, I'll think about it.
KATHLEEN: That's a lot for your dad
to buy at one time.
My dad gets me all the books I want.
That's very nice of him.
That's not my dad.
That's my nephew.
I don't really think
that he could be your nephew.
No, no, no. It's true.
Annabel is my aunt.
Isn't that right, Aunt Annabel?
- Uh-huh. And Matt is his...
- Wait, let me guess.
Are you his uncle?
No.
His grandfather?
His great-grandfather?
I'm his brother!
Matt is my father's son.
Annabel is my grandfather's daughter.
We are...
...an American family.
Here you go, young lady.
ANNABEL: - What's that?
- That's a handkerchief.
Do children even know
what handkerchiefs are?
A handkerchief is a Kleenex
that you don't throw away. See?
My mother embroidered this for me.
My initials and a daisy, because
daisies are my favorite flower.
May I ask who you are?
Kathleen Kelly. I own this store.
And you are?
Joe. Just call me Joe.
We'll take these books.
GEORGE:
Okay.
You're gonna come back, aren't you?
- Of course.
GEORGE: - See?
That is why we won't go under.
Our customers are loyal.
They're opening a Fox Books
around the corner.
- Fox Books! My daddy...
- Likes to buy discount.
But don't tell anybody.
It's nothing to be proud of.
F-O-X.
That's amazing!
You can spell "fox."
Can you spell "dog"?
F-O-X.
Look at this dinosaur book.
It's a pop-up dinosaur book.
Wouldn't you like to have
a dinosaur book like that?
Wouldn't you like to read that?
Sit here and read Matt the book
until I take care of things.
Whatever you do, just don't listen
to anything I say. Thank you.
We'll take that pop-up book as well.
The world is not driven by discounts.
I've been in business forever.
I started helping my mother
when I was 6, and I used to watch her.
She wasn't just selling books.
She was helping people become
whatever they were going to be.
When you read a book as a child,
it becomes part of your identity...
...in a way that no other reading
in your life does.
And I have gotten carried away.
Yeah.
Yeah, you have.
You've made me feel...
Enchanting.
Your mother was enchanting.
Yes, she was.
- How will you be paying for this?
- Cash.
How did you know that?
From the photograph.
That you in the photograph?
What are you doing?
Twirling.
My mother and I used to twirl.
She left the store to me,
and I'll leave it to my daughter.
GEORGE: Seventy-three dollars, please.
- How much?
Uh, 73 dollars.
Oh. Uh...
How old is your daughter now?
I don't have a daughter. Oh!
I'm not married. But eventually...
So the big, bad Fox Books
can just go to hell.
- Here you go.
- Thank you. Hey, we're ready?
- That's nice.
ANNABEL: - Bye, Kathleen.
Goodbye, Annabel.
Goodbye, Matt.
Oh, Matt, I have to ask you
another thing.
Can you spell cat?
F-O-X.
Cat. Thanks.
Good thing it wasn't the fish.
JOE:
Take care!
JOE:
No protests, no demonstrations.
KEVIN:
The neighborhood loves us.
NELSON: They're wondering where
we've been all these years...
...how they did without us.
It's a hit!
How's the children's department?
It's early. School's not out.
And there is that children's store nearby.
Shop Around the Corner.
SCHUYLER:
Cecilia's store. Cecilia Kelly.
We might have had a date once.
JOE: Her daughter owns it now.
NELSON: We'll crush it.
SCHUYLER:
She was enchanting.
BIRDIE:
They've been open six days.
And we did $ 1200 less
than the same week last year.
That could be a fluke, right?
Or not.
Their store is new.
It's a novelty.
It'll all shake out. Meanwhile,
I'm putting up more twinkle lights.
That's a fine idea.
What if we have to fold?
I'll never find
another part-time job.
Then I won't be able to pay
my rent, and I'll have to move.
To Brooklyn!
GEORGE: Ah, the joy of rent control.
Six rooms...
...450 a month.
We know.
You've told us a million times.
I can't believe you're bringing
this up at a time like this.
It's like those people who brag
because they're tall.
We are not going to fold.
Hey, I...
This place is a tomb.
I'm going to the nut shop
where it's fun.
George?
George?
Miranda!
Hi! Hi!
Kathleen, are you surviving?
We're so excited about your new book.
When should we schedule a signing?
It's being published in January.
Will you be in business in January?
I'm so worried.
We're doing great.
Aren't we?
BIRDIE:
No difference whatsoever!
Great.
Thank God!
You can count on me for anything.
Support, rallies, picket lines.
We can get the
to write something.
Or that nut from the
What...?
- What nut in the
MIRANDA: Frank something-or-other.
The one who's in love
with his typewriter.
This is just the sort of thing
that would outrage him.
FRANK:
KATHLEEN: That's not the point.
She thinks my store is in trouble.
Why would she say that?
There's enough business for us all.
FRANK: - Yes, there is. No question.
- We are fine.
You're more than fine.
You're absolutely fine.
- We are fine.
- Yes.
How are you?
- Fine.
- Fine.
Vince will be so happy to see you.
FRANK: Congratulations.
Guess who I saw on the subway today?
PATRICIA:
This is amazing. He said:
"You should go to a retreat.
You really should go to a retreat."
Honey, will you get me
another drink? I'm all out.
"It's a really great place...
...to calm down."
He said that to me.
Isn't that hilarious?
Champagne, please.
Stoli on the rocks.
But a fresh glass, please.
White wine, please.
BARTENDER: - Here you go.
- Thank you.
Oh, hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Do you remember me,
from the bookstore?
Of course I remember you. Yes.
How's your aunt?
She's great. Thanks.
I'd better go deliver this.
I have a very thirsty date.
She's part camel.
Joe, right? Joe, isn't it?
And you are Kathleen.
Kathleen Kelly.
Two white wine, please.
I cannot believe that
you were speaking to Joe Fox.
- Joe Fox?
- Joe Fox.
- As in...
- As in...
...he's gonna take over everything.
Fox? Your last name is Fox.
F-O-X.
God! I didn't realize...
I didn't know...
Who you were with?
I didn't know who you were with.
Excuse me?
It's from
Sorry, it's from
It's when the movie producer
realizes that Tom Hagen...
...is an emissary of vito Corleone.
Just before the horse's head
ends up in the bed...
...with all the bloody sheets.
Wakes up and it's:
Aah! Aah! Aahh!
Never mind.
You were spying on me, weren't you?
You probably rented those children.
Why would I spy on you?
Because I am your competition,
which you know...
...or you wouldn't have put up the sign:
"Just around the corner."
Our store entrance is around the corner.
There's no other way to say it.
It's not the name of our store.
It's where it is.
And you do not own the phrase
"around the corner."
KATHLEEN:
What is that?
What are you doing?
What is that? What are you doing?
You're taking all the caviar?
That caviar is a garnish.
The reason I came into your store...
...is because I was spending the day
with Annabel and Matt.
I was buying them presents.
I'm the type of guy who likes to buy
his way into the hearts of children...
...who are his relatives.
There was only one place to find
a children's book in the neighborhood.
That won't always be the case.
And it was yours.
And it is...
...a charming little bookstore.
You probably sell, what,
$350,000 worth of books in a year?
How did you know that?
I'm in the book business.
I am in the book business.
JOE:
I see.
And we are the Price Club.
Only instead of a 10-gallon vat
of olive oil for 3.99...
...that won't even fit under your
kitchen cabinet, we sell cheap books.
Me, a spy? Absolutely.
I have in my possession the secret
printout of the sales figures...
...of a bookstore so inconsequential,
yet full of its own virtue...
...that I had to rush over for fear
it will put me out of business.
What? What?
Hey. How you doing? Frank Navasky.
Joe Fox.
- Joe Fox?
- F-O-X.
The inventor of the superstore.
Of course.
The enemy of the mid-list novel.
The destroyer of City Books.
Tell me something, really.
How do you sleep at night?
I use a wonderful
over-the-counter drug:
Ultra-dorm.
Don't take the whole thing, just half.
You'll wake up without
even the tiniest hangover.
- You're Frank Navasky, aren't you?
- Yes. Leaving.
PATRICIA:
Your last piece in the
...about Anthony Powell was brilliant.
- Really?
- Brilliant. Yes.
I'm Patricia Eden.
Hi. Eden Books.
Joe, this man is the greatest
living expert...
...on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
FRANK:
You really liked my...?
This is Kathleen Kelly.
My piece? I just...
You know? I'm flattered.
You write these things.
You think somebody'll mention them.
A week goes by, the phone
doesn't ring and you think:
"I'm a fraud.
I'm a failure or something."
You know what fascinated me
about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg?
Is how old they looked,
when they were really just our age.
You know?
Oh, wow, I'm so happy to have
finally met you.
We will talk. Have you ever
thought about doing a book?
It's crossed my mind,
something relevant for today...
...like the Luddite movement in
Call me.
JOE: Hon, have you ever had
a caviar garnish?
I had no idea Frank Navasky...
...was going to be so down-to-earth.
You read his stuff...
...you think he's going to be
so obscure and abstruse.
He's always talking about Heidegger...
...and Foucault.
And I have no idea what
any of it's about, really.
JOE:
I'm not tired. I'm not.
JOE:
KATHLEEN:
Blank.
Bottom-dweller...
...who recently belittled
my existence?
Nothing.
Nothing. Even now.
Days later...
JOE:
Meet?
Oh, my God...
Seventy-two twenty-seven.
This is a cash-only line.
- What?
- Cash only.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I just have a credit card.
I'm sorry. Is that okay?
MAN:
No, it's not okay.
There's a sign.
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
I never do this, but I'm asking you to
make an exception in this one case.
MAN:
You have no cash?
- She has no cash.
- No, she has no cash.
Get on another line, lady.
I have a dollar.
That's all.
I have a dollar. One dollar.
- Is there anything you can do?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hi. You need some money?
No, I do not need any money.
Thank you very much.
CASHIER: - Get in another line.
- Hi.
Rose.
That is a great name. Rose.
This is Kathleen.
I'm Joe...
And I'm Henry.
Henry, how are you?
Happy holidays.
This is a credit card machine.
Happy Thanksgiving.
It's your turn to say
"Happy Thanksgiving" back.
Happy Thanksgiving back.
Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
JOE: - Orange.
Orange who?
"Orange" you going to
give us a break...
...by zipping this credit card
through the credit card machine?
Come on, you can do it.
Zip, zip.
There you go.
Rose?
That is a great name.
So you're fine.
Fine.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Henry, happy Thanksgiving.
I'm so sorry. Really.
- I apologize from the bottom of my heart.
HENRY: - So sign already!
- I'd like to get home for the parade.
ROSE: - You have my pen.
NELSON: Wonderful!
ANNABEL: Thank you.
I got it.
KATHLEEN:
JOE:
KATHLEEN:
JOE:
Hi.
Uh-oh.
KATHLEEN:
Hmm.
JOE:
Please say no.
No. How cute is that?
KATHLEEN:
Huh.
Well...
JOE:
No. Mm-mm.
KATHLEEN:
Okay.
JOE:
...go to the mattresses.
"Except to say go to the matt..."
What?
What does that mean?
JOE:  The Godfather.
What is it with men and
Hello?
Oh, come on. Hello?

Well, what can I...

JOE:

Don't.
Fight to the death.
It's not personal.
It's business. Just fight!
Fight, fight, fight!
FRANK: - Hey.
- Hey.
I've been thinking.
- Frank.
- What?
I've decided to go the mattresses.
Do you think it would be a conflict of
interest if you wrote about the store?
- Yes.
- Yes?
No.
So you'll do it?
Yes. Yes.
Do you know what it is
to go to the mattresses?
From
GEORGE:
Good morning, Shop Around the Corner.
George speaking, may I help you?
CHRISTINA: Kathleen,
the Channel 2 truck just pulled up.
KATHLEEN:
In a second.
CHRISTINA:
Everyone's read the article.
BIRDIE: "So you do not have to look
to the usual places...
...where good and evil face off...
...the places Herodotus called
'the happy land of absolutes.'
We have the perfect example
here on the West Side...
...where the cold cash cow,
Fox Books...
...threatens survival of a temple...
...to one of the twentieth century's
most profound truths:
BOTH:
You are what you read."
I believe that.
BIRDIE:
"Save The Shop Around the Corner...
...and you will save your soul."
Frank, that's charming.
Think it's a little over the top?
GEORGE: That was
I told them to come over whenever.
Oh, man.
Float like a butterfly.
Sting like a bee.
"We don't want this superstore."
- Is that what they're saying?
- Catchy.
- Well, who wrote that?
NELSON: - Annoying.
Pissing me off, actually.
KATHLEEN:
Do you want the West Side...
...to become one big,
gigantic strip mall?
CROWD:
No!
Do you want to get off the subway
at 72nd and Broadway...
...and not even know
you're in New York City?
Can we save
The Shop Around the Corner?
CROWD:
Yes!
She's not as nice as she seems on TV.
- You met her?
- Yeah.
Boy, she's a pill.
Probably ain't as fine
as she look on TV either.
Oh, no, no. She's beautiful.
But she's a pill.
KEVIN:
You don't feel bad...
...about sending her ass back
to the projects with food stamps?
Broke, single, white lady.
It's not personal.
- It's business.
- Yeah.
Hey, here's a good-looking guy!
REPORTER:
That's what you said?
REPORTER:
That's not all I said.
I can't believe those bastards.
I said we were great!
I said you could read for hours
and no one will bother you.
I said we had 150,000 titles. I showed
them the New York City section.
I said we were a goddamn piazza.
A place in this city where
people could mingle.
Piazza?
I was eloquent!
- Shit!
- A piazza.
It's inevitable. People want
to turn her into Joan of Arc.
And you into Attila the Hun.
Not me personally,
but the company, yeah.
SIDNEY-ANN:
That was nice. Thank you.
Thank you. Sounded good.
- Are you taping this?
- Yeah, I'm taping this.
- I've heard you say that before.
- She hasn't.
SIDNEY-ANN:
FRANK:
She gets it.
You gonna start collecting radios now?
SIDNEY-ANN:
-
-
KATHLEEN:
Frank.
She's coming on to you.
They do this on television.
FRANK:
KATHLEEN:
Is she sweating?
She's touching herself.
And she's sweating.
We can turn it off.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
No. I was being polite.
-
-
Thank you're?
I slobbered all over her, didn't I?
But I think that
there's something there.
GEORGE: So first, I gotta go get
some eucalyptus candles...
...because it makes
my apartment smell mossy.
Then I'm going to the market,
and I can't decide whether to get...
...sausage for the meat sauce,
or chopped meat.
Spare us.
GEORGE:
You know what? Clam sauce.
Because this is a big date.
Don't tell me.
Not the slightest difference?
How can that be?
All this publicity
and not one bit of difference?
Birdie, what am I going to do?
What would Mom have done?
Well, let's ask her.
Cecilia, what should we do?
- Birdie?
- Shh.
She has no idea.
But she thinks
the window display is lovely.
- Good night, dearie.
- Good night.
KATHLEEN:
JOE:
So I suppose she's carrying a copy
of a book with a flower in it?
Not really?
She could be a real dog, man.
I'm only staying 10 minutes.
I'll say hello, have a cup
of coffee and then I'll split.
Hope she doesn't have a squeaky voice
like the mice in
Why am I doing this?
Why am I compelled to meet her? Why?
Relax. You're just taking it
to the next level.
I always do that.
I always take a relationship
to the next level.
If that works out, I take it
to the next level after that.
Till I reach that level where
it becomes absolutely necessary...
...for me to leave.
Huh. I won't stay that long anyway.
I already said that, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.
- Oh!
JOE:
Well, okay. Café Lalo. This is it.
Eight o'clock.
We got here fast, didn't we?
Kevin...
...this woman is the most adorable
creature I've ever been in contact with.
If she turns out even to be
as good-looking as a mailbox...
...I'd be crazy not to turn my life
upside down and marry her.
She could be a real dog.
But good luck.
Would you go and look for me?
Go look through the window
and check her out. Please?
All right.
- You're pathetic, man.
- Ha-ha-ha.
KEVIN:
All right. I'll see what I see.
You see her?
Oh, wait, yeah.
I see a very beautiful girl.
She's fine. She's fine.
- I knew it.
- She's gorgeous.
I knew she would be.
But no book.
All right. Okay, wait.
Wait a minute.
There's a book with a flower.
So this got to be her.
What does she look like?
Can't see. Waiter's blocking.
Damn it!
Hold on, he's moving.
- Yeah?
- Uh...
JOE:
Can you see her?
Can you see her?
Yeah.
And?
She's very pretty.
She is!
I knew she would be!
She had to be!
She had to be!
You know what?
She look...
I mean, she almost has
the same coloring as...
...that Kathleen Kelly person.
Kathleen Kelly of the bookstore?
Why not? You thought
she was attractive.
Absolutely. Why not?
Who cares about Kathleen Kelly?
Well, if you don't like
Kathleen Kelly...
...I can tell you right now...
...you ain't gonna like this girl.
Why not?
Because it is Kathleen Kelly.
What are you going to do?
Nothing.
You just gonna let her
wait there all night?
That's exactly what I'm going to do.
Good night.
I'll see you in the morning.
Do you mind if I borrow this chair?
Yes, I mind. Sorry.
I'm expecting someone.
Would you like another tea?
Yes. Thank you.
JOE:
Kathleen Kelly.
Hello. This is a coincidence.
Would you mind if I sat down?
Yes, I would, actually.
I'm expecting someone.
Do you mind?
I bet you read that book every year.
I bet you just love that...
...Mr. Darcy.
Your sentimental heart beats wildly
at the thought he and...
...whatever her name is are truly,
honestly going to end up together.
WAITER: - Can I get you something?
- No, he's not staying.
Mochaccino decaf, nonfat.
You are not staying.
I'll just stay here until
your friend gets here.
Gee, is he late?
The heroine of
is Elizabeth Bennet.
She is a great and complex character.
Not that you would know.
As a matter of fact, I've read it.
Oh, well, good for you.
You'd discover a lot
if you really knew me.
I know what I'd find.
Instead of a brain, a cash register.
Instead of a heart, a bottom line.
What?
- I just had a breakthrough.
- What is it?
For the first time, when confronted
with a horrible, insensitive person...
...I knew exactly what I
wanted to say, and I said it.
You have a gift for it. That was a
perfect blend of poetry and meanness.
Meanness?
Let me tell you about meanness.
Don't misunderstand me.
I'm trying to pay you a compliment.
- What are you doing?
- What is this?
Is this a red rose?
No, it's a crimson rose.
Something you read about in a book.
It's funny to you, isn't it?
Everything is a joke to you.
Please leave.
Please leave, I beg you.
Thank you.
That hanky reminds me
of the first day I met you.
First day you lied to me.
- I didn't lie to you.
- You did too.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
- I did not.
- You did too.
- I did not.
- You did too.
I thought that Fox stuff
was so charming. F-O-X.
I didn't lie about it.
- Joe? "Just call me Joe."
- Sure.
As if you were a stupid
"Hi, I'm Kimberly."
"Hi, I'm Janice."
Don't they know you're
supposed to have a last name?
It's like an entire
generation of cocktail waitresses.
Look.
- I am not a 22-year-old cocktail waitress.
- That's not what I meant.
When I said the thing about
the Price Club and olive oil...
...that's not what I meant.
You poor, sad multimillionaire.
I feel so sorry for you.
I'll take a wild guess
that's not him, either.
So who is he, I wonder?
Certainly not
the world's greatest expert...
...on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
But somebody else entirely different.
Will you be mean to him too?
No, I will not.
The man who is coming here
is completely unlike you.
The man who is coming here
is kind and funny.
He's got a wonderful sense of humor.
But...
...he's not here.
If he's not, he has a reason...
...because there is not a cruel
or careless bone in his body.
I wouldn't expect you to understand
anybody like that.
You with your theme park, multi-level,
homogenize-the-world Mochaccinoland.
You've deluded yourself that you're a
benefactor bringing books to the masses.
But no one will ever
remember you, Joe Fox.
And maybe no one will remember me.
But plenty of people
remember my mother.
They think she was fine.
They think her store
was something special.
You are nothing but a suit.
That's my cue.
Good night.
PATRICIA: So then the agent asks
for $600,000 and I said to her:
"If you think I'm even
going to talk to you...
...about paying that kind
of advance for an author...
...whose last book is being used
as a trivet all over the world...
...you are completely crazy."
She was insulting and provocative
and the only thing pleasant about her...
...was the way her hair
fell across her forehead.
Underneath that disagreeable
exterior, she may be...
JOE:
A real bitch.
Let's not talk about it.
I'm going back to the office
and I'm sure you have work to do.
Not really.
This place is a well-oiled
machine, my friend.
So? What happened?
- He never came.
- He stood you up.
KATHLEEN:
I wouldn't characterize it that way.
I think something happened.
Something unexpected that
made it impossible for him to...
What if he showed up,
took one look at me and left?
Not possible.
Maybe there was a subway accident.
Absolutely.
A train got trapped underground
with him inside.
And no phone.
KATHLEEN: And you know how those
express trains create suction.
He got sucked onto the tracks.
The third rail.
CHRISTINA:
He's toast.
What happened?
He was unable to make it.
He stood you up?
Maybe he had a car accident.
Those cab drivers are maniacs.
They hit something and you slam
into that plastic partition.
Or his elbows could be in
splints, so he couldn't dial.
Or he could be unconscious.
In a coma.
Stuck in intensive care.
With a heart monitor beeping.
And like...
- No phone.
- No phone.
What?
What are you saying?
It could be.
He was arrested
two blocks from the café.
Is there a picture?
So that explains it.
He was in jail.
And there was a phone.
He only got one call,
so he called his lawyer.
You are so lucky.
You could be dead.
He couldn't be the Rooftop Killer.
Remember when you thought
Frank might be the Unabomber?
Well... That was different.
How long did you sit there all alone?
- Not long. Joe Fox came in.
- Joe Fox?
I don't want to talk about it.
Let's get to work.
There's got to be something to do.
There's always something to do.
GEORGE: Look at this.
CHRISTINA: He looks kind of cute.
BIRDIE:
So?
He was unavoidably detained.
BIRDIE:
He stood you up?
KATHLEEN:
MALE AOL VOICE:
JOE:
Did he say anything about
wanting to meet you again?
No, not really.
Listen, it doesn't matter.
We'll just be like George Bernard
Shaw and Mrs. Patrick Campbell.
We'll write letters our whole lives.
BIRDIE: Thank you for the scones.
They look lovely.
Birdie, where was this one taken?
Seville.
KATHLEEN: When you fell madly in love?
BIRDIE: Yes.
So, dearie,
what have you decided to do?
Close. We're going to close.
Close.
Closing the store is
the brave thing to do.
You are such a liar.
But thank you.
You are daring to imagine that
you could have a different life.
I know it doesn't feel like that.
You feel like a big, fat failure now.
But you're not.
You are marching into
the unknown, armed with...
...nothing.
Have a sandwich.
Not nothing.
I have a little money saved.
If you need more, ask me.
I'm very rich.
I bought Intel at six.
I suppose you want me
to tell you who it was...
...I fell madly in love with.
But I'm not going to tell.
Who was it, Birdie?
Come on, tell. Uch. That's so mean.
But so romantic.
BIRDIE: - It wasn't meant to be.
- Why not?
He ran Spain.
Spain?
The country, he ran it.
It was his job.
And then he died.
Just as well.
Milk or lemon?
She fell in love with
Generalissimo Franco.
Don't say that.
We don't know that for sure.
Who else could it have been?
It was around 1960.
- Do you want some popcorn?
- I can't believe this.
It's not like he was something normal,
like a socialist or an anarchist.
It happened in Spain.
People do stupid things
in foreign countries.
They buy leather jackets
for much more than they're worth.
But they don't fall in love
with fascist dictators.
Birdie is a very special person to me.
She is practically my surrogate mother.
She's out of her mind.
She is not.
I could never be with anybody who
doesn't take politics as seriously as I do.
WOMAN:
Do you mind?
A hot dog is singing.
You need quiet
while a hot dog is singing?
I have something to tell you, Frank.
- I didn't vote.
- What?
In the last mayoral election...
...when Rudy Giuliani was running
against Ruth Messinger...
...I went to get a manicure.
And forgot to vote.
Since when do you get manicures?
I suppose you could never be with
a woman who got manicures?
It's okay. I forgive you.
You forgive me?
Excuse me, I'm sorry. Excuse me.
This has been a big week.
You're closing the store.
No, it's not that.
Really, it's not.
I know, I know.
That was terrible of me.
What was terrible?
Jumping all over you
when I'm the one...
I don't even know how to say this.
What is it?
What?
You're a wonderful person.
So are you.
And I'm so honored that
you'd want to be with me...
...because you wouldn't be with
anyone who wasn't truly worthy.
- I feel exactly the same way.
- No, God, don't...
Don't say that.
That makes it worse.
What?
You don't love me.
Me either.
You don't love me?
No.
But we're so right for each other.
I know. I know.
Well, is there someone else?
Oh. That woman on television,
Sidney Ann.
Uh... Nothing has happened, but...
Is she a Republican?
I can't help myself.
What about you?
Is there someone else?
No.
No, but...
But there is the dream
of someone else.
WOMAN 1: Grab a copy of
This is a tragedy.
MAN: These chairs for sale?
GEORGE: Anything not nailed down.
CHRISTINA:
Ten dollars, it's yours.
WOMAN 2:
What are you going to do now?
I don't know. I think I'll take some time.
I'm almost looking forward to it.
WOMAN 2:
Good luck to you.
WOMAN 3: I came here every Saturday
when I was a little girl.
I remember when your mother
gave me
"Read it with a box of Kleenex"...
...she told me.
Could someone help me?
WOMAN 4:
She's looking down on you now.
I'm sure she is.
WOMAN 4:
Why don't we bomb Fox Books?
WOMAN:
Do you have the "shoe" books?
EMPLOYEE:
The shoe books?
Who's the author?
WOMAN:
I don't know.
My friend told me my daughter has to
read the shoe books, so here I am.
KATHLEEN:
Noel Streatfeild.
Noel Streatfeild wrote
...and
...and  and...
I'd start with  first.
It's my favorite.
Although
is completely wonderful.
But it's out of print.
Streatfeild.
How do you spell that?
KATHLEEN:
S-T-R-E-A-T-F-E-I-L-D.
WOMAN:
Thank you.
PATRICIA:
JOE:
Just like that?
PATRICIA:
Everyone was talking about her today.
Kathleen Kelly and her "situation."
And I was thinking that she'd make
a great children's book editor.
JOE:
What makes you think that?
Well, she knows everything.
She has flawless taste.
She's famous for it.
Salesmen swear by her.
If she likes the book, it sells. Period.
JOE:
You're going to offer her a job?
PATRICIA:
What else has she got to do?
- Now that she's destitute.
- Thanks to you.
- I don't see her working for you.
- Why not?
She lacks the killer instinct.
She's never fired anybody.
Look at that little shop.
Those people have been there forever.
Till recently, when they all
lost their jobs.
Thanks to you.
Hold the elevator!
CHARLIE:
Missy. Mr. Fox.
JOE:
Hello, Charlie.
I love how you've forgotten you had
any role in her current situation.
It's so obtuse.
It's so insensitive.
Reminds me of someone.
Who does it remind me of?
Me.
What is going on?
Could be stuck.
What are you doing?
I hope this thing doesn't plummet
to the basement.
- Can it do that?
- No.
It cannot plummet to the basement.
Hi, this is Joe Fox. Who's this?
Juan?
We are stuck in the elevator
between the sixth and seventh floor.
There's four of us.
And if you don't get your ass
up here in two shakes...
...and get us the hell out of here...!
Juan? Yeah.
Listen.
Call the super and then 9-1-1.
The fire department, that's right.
Thank you very much.
- Everyone should jump in the air.
- What?
We jump.
The elevator thinks no one
is here and it opens.
JOE:
One, two, three. Jump!
VERONICA:
If I ever get out of here...
...I'm going to start speaking
to my mama.
Wonder what she's doing
right this very minute?
If I ever get out of here...
...I'm marrying Orit.
I love her.
I should marry her.
I don't know what's been stopping me.
If I ever get out of here,
I'm having my eyes lasered.
If I ever get out of here...
Where are my Tic-Tacs? Ugh!
What?
JOE:
KATHLEEN:
JOE:
What happened?
Oh, hell.
How are you?
JOE: You know, Dad, you did pretty well.
At least you didn't marry her.
Welcome aboard.
- It lasted a while.
- Yeah.
NELSON:
You know...
...I've stayed on this boat after...
Let's see.
Your mother.
Laurette, the ballet dancer.
My nanny.
She was the nanny?
Yeah.
I forgot that.
How ironic.
Then there was the ice skater.
- Also my nanny.
- Really?
Yeah.
That's amazingly ironic.
And then there was Sybil, the, um...
- It's an "A" word.
- Astrologer.
Exactly.
Whose moon turned out to be
in someone else's house.
Just like Gillian.
- Gillian ran off with someone?
- The nanny.
- Nanny Maureen?
- Yes.
Gillian ran off with Nanny Maureen.
You got it.
JOE:
It's incredibly ironic.
- That's true.
- No other word for it.
Well, who's better than us?
Father and son, together at last.
Who did you say you broke up with?
Patricia.
You met her.
Would I like her?
Just kidding, son.
Now, is this beautiful or what?
Of course, I'll be living out of
a suitcase for at least three weeks.
And then there's
the inevitable legal hassle.
More of your inheritance
down the drain.
- Don't worry about it.
- I won't.
I just have to meet someone new.
That's the easy part.
Right, yeah.
A snap to find the one person in the
world who fills your heart with joy.
NELSON:
Don't be ridiculous.
Have I ever been with anybody
who fit that description?
Have you?
KATHLEEN :
It's Joe Fox.
- Uh, may I please come up?
-
I have a terrible...
...cold.
- Can you hear that?
- Yeah.
I'm taking echinacea and vitamin C
and sleeping practically...
...24 hours a day.
I have a temperature.
I would really appreciate it
if you'd just go away.
Kathleen?
Uh...
Uh, just a second!
Yes, just a second.
- Hello.
- Hello.
What are you doing here?
I heard you were sick.
And I was worried.
And I wanted to make sure...
What?
- Is there somebody here?
- No.
Oh. It's the Home Shopping Network.
You buy any of those
little porcelain dolls?
I was thinking about it.
- You put me out of business.
- Yes, I did.
- Did you come to gloat?
- No.
- To offer me a job?
- I would never...
I have plenty of offers.
I got offered a job by...
- By my former...
- Your former?
We broke up.
That's too bad.
You were so perfect for each other.
Oh.
I don't mean to say things like that.
No matter what you've done...
...there's no excuse
for my saying that.
Every time I see you...
Things like that just
fly out of your mouth.
I brought you flowers.
Ohh.
Thank you.
Why don't I just put these
in some water?
You're sick.
You should sit down.
I need a vase.
Above the refrigerator.
JOE:
There it is. Obviously.
George says hello, by the way.
He told me you were sick.
How is George?
Great, really great.
He's revolutionizing the place.
You can't work in his department...
...unless you have a Ph.D.
In Children's Literature.
I love daisies.
- You told me.
- They're so friendly.
Don't you think daisies
are the friendliest flower?
I do.
When did you break up?
Couple of weeks ago.
Everyone is breaking up.
You. Me.
This other person I know broke up
with someone in an elevator.
Or after it, or just outside it or...
It got stuck.
When I saw you at the coffee place,
I was waiting for him.
And I was...
Charming.
I was not charming.
JOE:
You looked charming. Tea?
Yes. I was...
I was upset and horrible.
JOE: - Honey?
- Yes.
I was the horrible one.
Well, that's true.
But I have no excuse.
Oh, I see what you're saying.
That's interesting.
Whereas I am a horrible person...
...therefore I have no choice
but to be horrible.
That's what you're saying.
But that's all right.
I put you out of business so...
...you're entitled to hate me.
I don't hate you.
But you'll never forgive me.
- Just like Elizabeth.
- Who?
Elizabeth Bennet in
She was too proud.
I thought you hated
Or was she too prejudiced...
...and Mr. Darcy is too proud?
I can't remember.
It wasn't personal.
What is that supposed to mean?
I'm so sick of that.
All that means is that
it wasn't personal to you.
But it was personal to me.
It's personal to a lot of people.
What is so wrong
with being personal anyway?
Nothing.
Whatever else anything is,
it ought to begin by being personal.
My head is starting to get fuzzy.
Why did you stop by again?
I forget.
I wanted to be your friend.
Oh.
I knew it wasn't possible.
Sometimes a guy
just wants the impossible.
Can I ask you a question?
What?
What happened with that guy
at the café?
Nothing.
But you're crazy about him?
Yes, I am.
Why don't you run off with him?
What are you waiting for?
I don't actually know him.
Really?
I only know him through...
You won't believe this.
JOE:
Let me guess.
Through the Internet?
Yes.
JOE:
Hmm.
"You've got mail."
Yes.
Those are very powerful words.
Yes.
I'm happy for him.
Although...
Could I just make a suggestion?
What?
I think...
...you should meet him.
No, wait, I take that back.
Why would you meet
somebody you're crazy about?
I hardly think I need to take
advice from a person who...
I can see I bring out
the worst in you.
Let me help you
to not say something...
...you'll torture yourself about
for years to come.
I hope you feel better soon.
It'd be a shame to miss
New York in the spring.
Thank you for the daisies.
Well, you take care.
I will.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
KATHLEEN:
JOE:
Some tweaking?
A project that needed...
..."tweaking."
- Yeah, that's what he said.
- T-W-E-A-K-l-N-G? Tweaking.
It sounds to me like he's married.
Three kids.
That's a terrible thing to say.
He couldn't be married.
How do you know?
Have you said, "Are you married?"
No, I'm not going to... No.
KATHLEEN:
JOE:
- So he didn't answer the question.
- Yes, he did.
- He did not.
- He did. He did. He nailed me.
He knew what I was after which is,
by the way, exactly like him.
He did not answer
the question, did he?
No.
Maybe he's fat.
He's fat. He's a fatty.
I don't care.
You don't care that he's so fat...
...he has to be removed from his house
by a crane. You don't care.
KATHLEEN:
That is very unlikely.
That is completely ridiculous.
What's his handle?
Uh...
I'm not going to write him.
You think I'm going to e-mail him?
All right, N-Y-1-5-2.
N-Y-1-5-2? 152.
He's 152 years old.
He's had 152 moles removed...
...so now he's got
on his face.
The number of people who think
he looks like Clark Gable.
he looks like a Clark Bar.
KATHLEEN: - Why'd I even tell you?
- 152 stitches from his nose job.
The number of his souvenir
shot glasses...
...that he's collected
in his travels.
His address.
No, he would never do
anything that prosaic.
The only thing I
really care about is that...
...aside from the married thing
and the jail thing...
...is the boat thing.
What boat thing?
I could never be
with someone who had a boat.
I have a boat.
Oh.
Which clinches it.
We'll never be together.
- How many?
- Three.
- Allow me.
- Thank you.
I could never be with
someone who likes Joni Mitchell.
What does that mean?
Is she a pilot?
It must be a metaphor,
but I don't know what it is.
JOE:
How's your book coming?
KATHLEEN: There's this
children's book editor I know.
She's excited to read it
when I'm finished.
Who would ever have thought
that I would write?
- If I hadn't had all this time...
- Uh-huh.
- You know what?
- What?
The truth is he was the one who
started me thinking about writing.
Mr. 152 Felony Indictments.
Mr. 152 Insights Into My Soul.
Oh. Whoa. Yeah. Oh.
No competing with that.
I keep on bumping into you.
Hope your mango's ripe.
I think it is.
You want to bump into me...
...on Saturday around lunchtime?
- Yeah.
- Over there?
- Uh-huh.
- Good.
JOE:
Okay, let's do it.
Ready? And...
Doot.
There it goes.
- Today?
- Today.
Wow.
I know. In Riverside Park.
That would mean he's a Westsider.
Maybe I've seen him
and don't even know it.
JOE: You could have seen him
every day and not know it.
KATHLEEN:
It's very possible.
- He could be anyone.
- He could be that guy.
And those flowers are for you.
JOE: - Could be the Zipper Man.
- Who's that?
The Zipper Man.
Who is that?
He repairs zippers
on Amsterdam Avenue.
- Will you cut it out?
- You'd never have to buy new luggage.
The timing here is everything.
He's waited until you're primed.
See?
Until you are absolutely convinced
that there's no other man...
...that you could possibly love.
Yes.
You know, sometimes I wonder.
What?
If I hadn't been Fox Books...
...and you hadn't been
The Shop Around the Corner...
...and you and I had just met.
- I know.
- Yeah. Yeah.
I'd have asked for your number.
I wouldn't have been able to wait
"How about some coffee...
...or drinks or dinner...
...or a movie...
...for as long as
we both shall live?"
Joe...
You and I would never
have been at war.
The only thing we'd fight about would be
which video to rent on a Saturday night.
Who fights about that?
Some people.
Not us.
We would never.
If only.
- I gotta go.
- Let me ask you something.
How can you forgive this guy
for standing you up...
...and not forgive me
for this tiny little thing...
...of putting you out of business?
How I wish you would.
I really have to go.
You don't want to be late.
JOE:
Brinkley!
Brinkley!
Don't cry, Shopgirl.
Don't cry.
I wanted it to be you.
I wanted it to be you so badly.
