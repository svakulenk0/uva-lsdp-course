KRAMER: There's a reporter
in London named Simon Ross.
We caught some phone chatter we
didn't like and his name came up.
They put a team out there
to take a better look.
They've been sitting
on him pretty tight all day.
I just got a call about an hour ago.
We got a real problem here.
TURSO: What kind
of problem?
This guy's a writer
for The Guardian.
He's preparing an exposé on Jason
Bourne, Treadstone and Blackbriar.
Sourced how?
Unknown.
From Bourne?
Is it possible?
Possible?
We had Bourne
six weeks ago in Moscow.
He was on foot, wounded, with a
full Cossack posse up his ass.
Somehow,
he walked out of there.
I've kind of lost my perspective
on what's possible.
You sound tired, Ezra.
I would make more of an
effort if I were you.
You're the director of the
Central Intelligence Agency
of the United States of America,
for God's sake. Act like it.
If I go down for this, Mark,
if this goes any more wrong...
Ezra,
you were given a Ferrari and your
people treated it like a lawn mower.
You break it, you bought it.
It was ever thus.
Well, maybe I should be
speaking directly to Ric Byer.
No, no, no. You're in
enough trouble already.
I'll let him know.
DITA: Julie, is that the last of them?
Terrific, thank you.
BYER: So, the last audit
on Treadstone?
INGRAM: Third page.
DITA: Seven weeks ago.
This is from the CIA,
or this is ours?
Oh, no. It's theirs.
This whole pile is theirs.
Is anybody reading
these ground cables?
INGRAM: Look, how wide
are we digging?
What do you mean, "how wide?"
Just get me everything.
Treadstone, Blackbriar, Outcome, LARX.
All the beta programs.
And that means take it all the
way back to Emerald Lake.
I want all points of convergence,
I want all research personnel,
I want to know
about anybody who talked
to anybody about
anything at any time.
Seriously, has anybody looked
at this stuff on Bourne?
The field reports.
It's incredible.
Three years off-program, non-med,
first-gen, still rolling.
If there's any way we can score
some data off of this...
if they caught him alive...
I mean, even as a base line.
Even forensically.
Maybe you're in
the wrong meeting.
Because the meeting that we're
having is about an infection.
We're here talking about
a serious infection
and all we're trying to do is
determine how far it's spread
so that we know how much we have
to cut to save the patient.
You have never
heard of Treadstone.
And Bourne... I don't care if they bag
him and drop the body on the sidewalk.
We're not going to touch it.
You're going to turn off
that side of your head now
and get with
the rest of us here.
And you're going to start to consider
the magnitude of what we're facing
if this moves sideways on us.
Because if we get
into this, we dig around,
and we find out
these CIA clowns
have let this Treadstone mess metastasize
into the rest of these programs?
Just pray that
that doesn't happen.
MALE ANCHOR: We're just getting reports
coming in now from Waterloo Station
Let's take you live down there
and speak to Jeremy Thompson.
There's still an awful lot of
confusion here at Waterloo Station.
As you can see, ambulances
have been called up.
The victim, Simon Ross,
was a veteran reporter
with The Guardian
newspaper in London.
He was pronounced
dead at the scene.
Police are now telling us
there was at least one,
and possibly as many
as three, shots fired.
Simon Ross, a reporter with
The Guardian newspaper...
Hey, James.
Hey.
Oh, shit, sorry. I didn't
know I was coming back.
It's all right.
Can you tell Dr. Hillcott
I'm here?
You got it.
See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
I had no idea he was coming in.
It's Number Six.
Number Six?
We haven't seen him since July.
Mmm-hmm. Okay.
"Need new base panels, choline
profile, nerve conduction."
I want a full
engraftment workup.
I'm gonna call NRAG and see if we
can't get approval to put him under.
I want a marrow and a full
spinal while we have him.
Okay.
How is he?
He's prepped.
He drank a half-liter of
water while he was waiting.
He had some renal
issues last year.
Or maybe he was thirsty.
I have a pending task request.
I know, I read it.
I'm trying to complete
my cortex study.
He'll get a more sustained
contrast off an IV.
I'm approved?
Mmm-hmm.
Yes! Thank you!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
We haven't seen you in awhile
so we're going to be
doing a full spec workup.
I just had a full spec
three months ago.
Yeah, well, we had to change
the boundary schedules
and you're a week
over the new line.
Let me get this straight,
if I had come in
have been in the clear?
It never gets any
longer, does it?
You're gonna have
to take that off.
Today, I have
the honor of introducing the man
who is going to introduce
our guest of honor.
DR. HIRSCH: I first met
Dan Hillcott in 1987
at what must have
been the most boring
neuropsych conference
ever held.
We managed to escape
that dreary ballroom
and find a dark corner
and a cold beverage.
And we've been finding
dark corners ever since.
TURSO:  My God.
Where did you find this?
YouTube.
I thought we had
everything firewalled.
BYER: Yeah, so did I.
But then again, I thought the
CIA would handle Treadstone,
so maybe I'm just
behind the curve.
Hmm.
Well, is that it?
Is that all of it?
No, no. They apparently
thought it was okay
to attend about a half a dozen
of these things together.
Proving what?
We're looking at the medical
directors of Treadstone and Outcome
publicly celebrating
their top secret man-crush.
If this Bourne mess exposes Treadstone,
they will turn Hirsch inside out.
They'll be talking to Hillcott
before we even know what happened.
What's the damage?
Outcome. We'd lose Outcome.
Uh, meaning what?
Meaning we will burn the
program to the ground.
And I mean from top to bottom.
Because of this?
Because they're friends?
These two guys
built our platform!
You want to wake up
and see this on CNN?
Jesus, Ric. Just like that?
Hirsch and Hillcott?
How many people even
understand this work,
let alone have the will
to pursue it?
Nothing has even happened yet!
And we have to get ready.
Ready for what?
Ready for what?
We don't lose it all, we've got the science.
We'll keep the data.
All of our JSOK liaisons
seem to be safe.
We've got the beta
programs tucked away.
We'll take a pause,
and we'll rebuild it.
I wish there was
a better alternative, but...
God.
Are you going to pretend
you don't know I'm here?
I was just trying to be polite.
I wasn’t expecting you so soon.
What did you do? Did you
come over the mountain?
Don't they forward my position?
You beat the record
by two days.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
You didn't know
there was a record?
No. It never came up.
It wasn't your record, was it?
No one comes over the mountain.
Yeah, well, I did.
I'm Aaron, by the way.
Why did you do that?
If you weren't on the clock,
why take the risk?
Why take the mountain?
I lost my chems.
I dropped my program kit,
that's why.
All right.
Protocol is for me to
call in your arrival.
They're going to want a sample pick-up.
You got blood work, right?
I owe today.
All right, pull it now.
The drone takes about
three hours to get up here
so I'll get some food started.
You can dry your shit.
So, look...
I got a real problem, here.
I came over that mountain
because I lost my chems.
What are you taking?
My daily?
Phys meds, 250 green.
Cognitive programs, 400 blue.
Define "lost."
Lost. Fell into the rocks
off a 20-meter cliff.
Lost.
How is that possible?
Look, I've had a pack of wolves
on my ass since I
left the drop, okay?
I thought I lost them, but
they came at me at the river,
so I took the ledge up to the ravine
to try to rally out the night.
I chose wrong.
I got caught out in the open,
I couldn't climb.
I couldn't make a fire,
my hands got stiff.
I dropped them.
You're going to have
to write that up.
So, is that yours?
Hmm?
The blood work?
That's yours, isn't it?
You're not a contact, are you?
Look, I'm sorry to
call you out like that.
It's just that...
I have never met anybody
in the program before.
Never, nobody.
You're the...
I know you have
some extra chems here.
I'm not supposed to ration you
out until you leave tomorrow.
Yeah.
Did you chem today?
AARON: Green only.
I haven't had a blue
in 32 hours.
People, listen up.
We have an imminent threat.
This is a national security
emergency, priority level five.
It's Wills.
Ric Byer.
Hey. Uh, he's here.
Bourne is here, in New York.
What?
Confirmed.
He's alive and mobile. That's all I have.
I gotta go.
Your friends are here.
I know.
Don't you think that's strange?
The wolves?
They don't do that.
They don't track people.
Yeah.
Maybe they don't
think you're human.
So, how many of us are there?
You ask too many questions.
Maybe you don't know, either.
So, what are you
doing up here anyway?
How do you know that
I'm not evaluating you?
I don't know. Are you?
Maybe I don't care.
Do you ever not care?
Maybe you're evaluating me.
I went off the grid for four
days, that's why I'm here.
I skipped my check-in.
Now I'm on this
bullshit scavenger hunt.
They have their reasons.
Yeah, well...
I thought I was having my wrist
slapped, but now I'm not so sure.
I'm still trying to
figure out if you're
supposed to kill me
or give me a pep talk.
Seriously, man,
you think too much.
Aren't we wired to stick
our nose in, you and I?
There's not another person
for 300 miles.
I know nobody's listening. Come on,
you've got to give me something.
Talk to me, come on!
Why did they pull you off the
field and put you up here?
It's not physical, with the way you've
been moving, so what did you do?
Turn down an assignment?
Start thinking for yourself?
Fall in love?
You fell in love.
It's better for wolves.
There's an ammo box by the door,
you take as much as you need.
We're done talking.
You ate, you're pulling out early.
You should hit it.
Okay.
Some othertime, then.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Good luck.
What's this?
BYER: I think that we need to
clarify something here, Don.
PAULSEN: Clarify what?
You keep using the word
"unacceptable"
and I want to know exactly what
you think you mean by that.
"Unacceptable"
means exactly that.
I don't like what
you're telling me,
I don't like how
you're telling me.
We're in a critical phase
on four missions, Ric.
The intelligence loss, if we stop
now, it couldn't be quantified.
Yes, actually, it could.
You'd be right back to where you were
before we delivered the program.
Don't tell me there's
a problem with Outcome
because I'd be
hearing about it.
I didn't say there was. You're
not saying much of anything.
One pill, once a week.
Every eight days.
So, no more blues and greens.
We're transitioning
everyone in the program.
Do you remember how to keep
an accurate diet log?
Yes.
PAULSEN: Do you understand
their full utility?
We just set Iran's
missile program back
one deep-cover agent.
The best action recon
out of North Korea
in the last two years
came from Outcome.
I'm fully aware of this. Do you
know how long we've waited
to get a real, long-term
operative inside Pakistani ISI?
You're asking me to
wipe the most valuable
intel-gathering assets
we've ever put in the field.
We're shutting things
down immediately
and this contingency
was covered loud and clear.
PAULSEN: Tell me this isn't why
we're having this conversation.
Jason Bourne got away,
didn't he?
That's what this is
all about, isn't it?
I have visibility on every action
program in the system except yours.
I'm sick of hearing the reason I
can't do something or see something
is because it hasn't cleared the
National Research Assay Group.
Where do you pull
this kind of weight?
Don, I'm a patriot,
the same as you are.
I bleed over this
the same way you do.
But you and I have our jobs
because we've got the strength
to do what's necessary
and I'm sorry, but
right now, this is it.
It's really coming down out there.
It's getting ugly.
Oh. yeah?
Well, maybe I should try
to get ahead of it, huh?
No, it's too late for that.
Just stick around.
I need some help squaring
the place away, anyway.
Yeah, I don't know.
I already have to do that
medication write-up.
I don't know if I want
to have to explain
my itinerary as well,
you know what I mean?
Don't worry about the chems,
I got that covered.
I'm gonna have a look.
Are you hearing that?
Are you expecting anything?
In this weather,
without a heads-up?
Well, it's definitely
getting closer.
What do you got?
Nothing, man, I got nothing.
Is it working?
Yeah, it's working.
The gear is fine.
It's not the gear.
Well, maybe it's a resupply.
They were here yesterday, and
they can't land in this, anyway.
Who the hell is it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
We should spread.
Yeah. Look,
I'll take the nest.
Let me know when you get
eyes on it, okay? Yeah.
PILOT: Is she gonna
clear us here?
I'd like to get above this
before it gets any sloppier.
Now, hold on.
Just, there's a...
Copy, Solo, I saw it, too.
Give us a minute.
SOLO:
PILOT: What's the issue?
Hang on, hang on.
Roger, Solo. Sourcing now.
It looks like there's still
an active signal back there.
Excuse me?
Is that on your end or is that...
SOLO: My end.
We're having a hard time
getting a handshake.
Roger, Solo.
Holding on relay.
I thought you had them linked.
We did.
They were lined up,
all the way to the structure.
Both targets were green,
all the way in.
SOLO: Is there a PID?
Unknown.
Hostile?
Unknown.
OFFICER: It's not
a satellite echo, is it?
No, sir.
OFFICER: What's she doing?
She's playing it back.
I don't want to wait on her. We're
going to have to come around.
How far are you
from bingo fuel?
Twenty minutes on station.
Better get on it.
SPEC: Affirmative, Solo, but we're
gonna need another pass here.
She knows we can't see shit, right?
Check it.
Roger that.
New profile engaged.
We're coming around now.
PILOT: Roger that, Solo.
East-southeast.
Coming right
back up the valley.
Requesting fuel graph,
say your state.
PILOT: State
two-plus-SO to splash.
Copy, Solo.
Fuel to bingo is green.
Sourcing target beacon now.
What just happened?
It's gone.
Where the hell did it go?
What do you mean,
"Where did it go?"
Solo, we are negative
on that signal here.
We just lost
that second beacon.
Negative, negative, Solo. All
sensors and systems are green.
Diagnostics are green,
aircraft is green.
I got everything
but a target here.
It is not a system issue.
Sensors are good.
All right, we're going to
switch to IR and take a look.
Roger.
Switching to thermal.
Solo, can I get your last confirmed...
What the hell was that?
SOLO: Red Crown,
we're getting some music.
SPEC: You hit something.
I don't think so.
Red Crown, you getting this?
There is nothing there.
There is nothing.
What the hell is
going on, here?
It didn't just go down, it was shot down?
They're sure about that?
That's what I was told.
By who? With what?
They don't know.
They were sourcing a second
signal when it happened.
DITA: No, no, no, we didn't have time.
I'm calling for clearance now.
There's got to be someone
meeting us at the gate.
They have a drone ready?
They're fueling one now.
They parsed the signal.
It's Aaron Cross.
Shit.
You're all set, sir.
PILOT: Let's approach off azimuth,
SPEC: Good for me.
SOLO: Red Crown to contact.
Three-zero-zero for 30.
SPEC: There you are.
There's my signal.
Signal is hot, Solo.
Signal is up and live.
And here we go.
PILOT: Where's that been?
Doesn't matter now.
It's mine.
Copy, Solo. Strong signal.
What kind of weapon system
is this guy operating?
He's probably got a rifle.
BYER: It's a high-powered
rifle.
What's our time frame, here?
Fifteen minutes, plus or minus.
Just trying
to factor the storm.
SPEC: Roger, Solo. Target is static.
Engaging laser now.
Hey!
Get out of here!
Go on, get out of here!
Get out!
SPEC: Laser armed.
Sensor and thermal confirmed.
Where are we?
SPEC: Thirty seconds.
You should have left me alone.
SPEC: Arming missile.
Missile away.
There he goes, he's moving now.
PILOT: Not for long.
SPEC: Target destroyed.
SOLO:
Copy, Solo. Kill confirmed,
target destroyed.
PILOT: Looking good?
SPEC: Looks good.
Looks cold and clear.
AARON: With all due respect,
sir, now is not the best time.
In 20 minutes, this place
is going to fall apart.
BYER: I'm aware of that, I'll take the chance.
We need to talk.
I need you to stop what
you're doing and turn around.
That's an order.
We got screwed
on the intel, okay?
Nobody knew those
people were in there.
It would be perfectly normal
for a person to have doubts
about the morality of what
we just asked you to do.
Is that a question, sir?
No, it's not. Tune in to what
I'm trying to say to you.
Do you know what
a sin-eater is?
That's what we are.
We are the sin-eaters.
It means that we take the moral
excrement that we find in this equation
and we bury it down
deep inside of us
so that the rest of
our cause can stay pure.
That is the job.
We are morally indefensible
and absolutely necessary.
Do you understand?
Will that be all?
Stitch that up.
I'm gonna put you on a plane
to Yemen in six hours.
I'll be ready.
TERRY: I told you
she'd be coming at us.
Yeah, I need you to
stay calm, Terry, okay?
They're giving her
a Senate hearing.
How can you not see
that as a problem?
She knows Bourne, she knows
Blackbriar, she knows Hirsch.
She's got a handle on the
whole goddamn operation.
I don't see how the hell you
could be so calm about this!
Well, what can she say?
What can she say?
What if she gets
up there and she says,
"Treadstone, Blackbriar,
you think that was it?"
"You think that Jason Bourne
was the whole story?"
"Sorry, there's a lot more
going on here."
What if she tells them that Treadstone
was just the tip of the iceberg?
BYER: Look, you want
to sweat something?
Worry about Outcome, because we're
still not out of the woods.
But as far as our other programs,
she doesn't know that much.
How do you know that?
Because we're tapped into
everything she says and does.
What?
Phones, email, cars,
house, lawyer.
She was cooked the minute she
hitched her wagon to Jason Bourne.
She aided and abetted
an international fugitive.
She prevented the agency from
shutting down a rogue operation.
She violated every oath and
code of conduct that matters.
For Christ's sake, she brought the
son of a bitch back to America.
Now, God knows
what her motives are,
but it's clear that protecting
this country is not one of them.
That used to be called treason.
Even the solution here. Now, that
should be coming up as a constant.
There you are. I don't
understand these values...
DR. BENEZARA:
My God, no!
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
WOMAN: What is that?
It's a gun.
No. I... No.
Yeah. No, it was gunfire.
No, please. No, no, no!
Help!
Open the door! He's shooting us!
Open the door!
DR. TALWAR: Open the door!
He's got a gun!
Open the door!
DR. TALWAR: Help!
Oh, my God.
We got to be able
to get a card!
We have to be able
to get in there!
What's happening?
We gotta go for the back door.
It's locked.
He locked the back door.
No, please.
He's gonna kill us all.
DR. CHANDRA: Don't do this.
Oh, my God.
Move!
He's shooting
everyone in there!
I need a red lab access card!
Who's got a red lab access card?
They're bringing one
down from upstairs.
They're all in there. Everyone
who has one is in there.
Billy, where are you, man?
I need a red card now!
Don...
What are you doing?
Shit, the handle's off.
The handle's off!
Drop it! Stop!
Drop the weapon!
Drop it! Drop the weapon!
MALE ANCHOR: Investigators are still
searching for some explanation
behind the workplace
murder-suicide
that left another American
community grieving and shocked.
Police and federal authorities
were poring over
the lab facility...
DITA: The boys need
to see you right away.
Let's get that Foite story
out there right away.
I'll take care of it.
COP: And this area,
back here?
That's all been
converted to storage.
Because it says on the blueprint,
and even on the board, there,
that it's a medical
examination suite.
I mean, what kind of examinations
are we talking about?
MARTA: There we go.
May I see the hand, please?
Oh, that has healed well.
Any diminished sensation?
Nope.
Are you trying to
put me down, doc?
I'm afraid there's
been a few gaps
in your sample
deliveries, so...
Uh-oh.
...we need a full
work-up this visit.
Another one?
Why? Is it 'cause
I missed a blood drop?
So, how do you think
it works, doc?
That we can just
call a timeout?
Everything stops while
you pull your samples?
Why don't you
lie down and relax?
Yeah.
What do you think
that we do out there?
Okay, that's
enough information.
No, I...
Well, you're just a doctor.
You know we're on camera.
Really?
Is that why you make such
an attractive appearance?
Okay, why don't you count
backward from 100, please?
Hello?
Yeah, the gate should be open.
Bear to the left.
It's about half-a-mile up.
Thanks.
Dr. Shearing?
Uh-huh.
Hi, I'm Dr. Connie Dowd.
Hi, how are you?
Well, thanks.
This is Special
Agent Larry Hooper.
Hello.
Hello.
Please. Come in.
DR. DOWD: Thanks for
letting us come out.
It's a remarkable property.
What a project.
Yeah, I really don't want
to talk about the house.
Not unless you want to buy it.
Sit, I guess. Please.
MARTA: Just so you know, okay,
I didn't know anything about
this meeting until an hour ago.
And nobody last night
said to make time
or pick a time,
or anything like that.
And then, this morning, I buy a
plane ticket to see my sister
and suddenly it's like
DEFCON 4 around here.
And that is not paranoia, okay?
That is pretty much
directly in my face!
DR. DOWD: Understood.
Should we not be
paying attention?
Can you leave us alone, Larry?
Look.
You’ve just been through an
extremely traumatic experience.
Yeah. Doctor of what?
What are you?
Clinical psychology.
Oh. So, what do you do?
You give grief
counseling to spies?
You have a very unusual
security clearance, Marta.
You should expect
that buying a ticket
to Montreal without telling
anyone would set off some bells.
Yeah, I've got some bells
of my own going off, okay?
I mean, are you going to be
the person who tells me
what the hell is going on here,
or are you just the next
mystery babysitter?
What do you think is going on?
What I'm trying
to do is not think.
I just... I want
to stop thinking.
Have you discussed those
feelings with anyone else?
Your sister? Friends?
Are you for real?
What about Peter Boyd?
Wow.
Okay.
So, we're into everything, is that it?
Is anything off-limits here?
Have you ever read your
employment security contract?
Have I read my...
If you're asking me whether I
understand my disclosure restrictions,
yes, I have a PhD
in biochemistry
with postdoctoral fellowships
in virology and genetics.
I know how to read!
What I don't understand
is why my colleague
has a psychotic episode
and shot everyone in the lab.
Are you aware of what
we do in there?
Are you?
I mean, how do I know that you're
even cleared for this conversation?
Have you discussed anything
to do with the incident
with anyone other
than the investigators?
Peter Boyd moved
out eight months ago.
But I guess you
already know that.
And, no, I haven't
spoken to him.
You stated that you and Dr. Foite had
no relationship outside of work.
None.
There was material in his
apartment that indicates he had
an unusual fixation with you.
Photographs, journal entries. They
found several articles of clothing.
What?
Did you ever rebuff him
in any way?
No.
No, no, I...
I always thought he was gay.
Look, no one is suggesting that
you're responsible for what happened.
Oh. Thank you.
Survivors often experience
feelings of guilt.
Those feelings can be amplified
by the realization
that he let you live.
That he let me live?
Have you seen the video?
Do you really think
that's what it shows?
You are asking all
the wrong questions!
What should I be asking, Marta?
Has anyone looked at
Dr. Foite's blood work?
Have they?
I mean, that is the only thing that
is going to make any sense, here.
His behavior was...
Look, there are
projects at Sterisyn,
defense projects that could
explain why he did what he did.
And people there are working
on behavioral design.
It's programmable behavior,
neural design.
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?
I think he was exposed
to something at the lab.
Found it.
What are you doing?
That's my gun.
What the hell is this?
You're a potential
suicide risk.
No. Wait a minute.
How did you...
How did he find that?
Marta...
No, no. Okay.
This meeting is now over.
I want you both out of here, right now!
Marta...
No! He has been
snooping around my house!
Marta, I want to
sign off here today!
I want to let you
get on that plane,
but you have got
to help us out!
Look, we have got to do
our job here, okay?
We have got to go through this.
I need to know that you are calm
and safe before I leave here
and I need to know that you understand
the rules before you get on that plane.
Please, just...
Please, sit down and let us
get through our questions.
Okay.
Jesus! What is this?
What the hell is this?
Ready?
Close.
What are you doing?
Get off me!
Set?
Get the hell off me now!
Set!
Green!
No!
DRIVER: Gene!
A runner in the basement!
Go!
Connie!
On your right.
One. Girl.
Find her.
Find her!
Gene! Talk to me!
Hey.
Unless you reloaded,
the gun is empty.
Look, look.
Dr. Shearing, it's me.
I'm not here to hurt you, okay?
How did you...
That was you!
Yes. Shh!
Listen to me.
Do you want to live?
Look at me.
Do you want to live?
Do you want to live?
Yes.
Good. Let go of this gun.
How is this possible?
Let go.
Take this.
Good.
Now, I need you to do
exactly what I say.
How is this possible? Listen to me.
Exactly what I say.
Understand?
Yeah.
Good.
AARON: Hey, doc?
I need my watch.
Doc, I need that watch!
Are there chems in this house?
Program medication.
Are they all dead?
Yeah, they're dead.
Look at me. Look at me. Do you
have program medication here?
What?
Chems. Greens, blues.
Do you have them here?
No, no.
No?
Here? No, no.
Here.
Where, then?
Where do you have them?
Where? Where do you
keep the chems?
I don't know.
Dr. Shearing, where are the chems?
I need the chems!
I understand, but I don't know.
It's not something...
We do virology control.
So, all of that happens...
We don't have medication.
If I had any,
I would give it to you.
Okay, listen to me.
We have less than eight minutes
to clear out of here, okay?
Yes.
Good.
Because the next thing
coming through that door
is going to wipe us out.
Can I get a sitrep, here?
If you can hear me,
pick up, Larry.
Larry, pick up.
AARON: Hey.
Sorry about the tran.
What's our frame-rate, here?
Connie says about 10.
Just wrapping up.
Tell her we need
a heads-up. Okay?
Copy that.
Hey.
It's probably
better you did this.
Where are we going?
June. Your name is
June Monroe, say it.
June Monroe.
Say it.
June Monroe.
Now pick a place you lived.
The last place you lived.
A place you know.
Bethesda. Bethesda,
that's where you live.
Anybody asks, you're June
Monroe from Bethesda.
You lost your wallet.
I'm driving you home.
My name is James.
James and June, you got it?
Yeah.
Okay.
Is that your name?
James?
No. What?
You don't know my name?
What do you call me? What do
you put on my blood work?
Five.
Five? The number five?
Do you know how
many times we've met?
Thirteen.
Thirteen exams over
the last four years.
And that's what
I get, a number?
Number Five. Okay.
Five of what, then?
How many are we?
Program participants?
That's what you call us?
There were nine. Then six.
Participants.
How did you find me?
Well, what do you think?
They're going to kill all of us
and then just
leave you guys alone?
You think your colleague
just went crazy?
Is that what you think?
I didn't think anything. They
wound him up and set him loose.
I really have no idea
what is going on.
What's going on is they're
shutting the whole thing down.
Who is "they"?
I don't know... Who were
the people at the house?
No, no, no, no.
You had your turn, okay?
You've been bleeding and scoping and
scraping me since the day we met.
It's my turn, now. I'm asking
the questions, you got it?
I need program meds, okay?
I need program meds.
Where do you keep the chems?
I don't have any.
I've already told you.
We don't have them.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
It's bullshit.
I don't have any!
So, you don't know anything?
You're just the help?
That's why you have the big house
and the security clearance, right?
That's why they're
trying so hard to kill you,
because you
don't know anything.
I know my job,
which is science.
I don't know what you do
when you leave the lab.
None of us do!
For four years!
Look, I want to get out!
Would you please stop the car?
You can't be that naive.
Would you let me out the car?
There's no way you're that naive!
You want out? Get out.
Go on, get out.
You don't have any chems. You
don't know where they are.
You don't know anything.
That's fine. Just get out.
But you got a plan, right?
Yeah, of course you do.
You're a doctor.
You've got this all
worked out, don't you?
What are you going to do?
Huh? What are
you going to do?
You can't run, not alone.
You don't know how.
You certainly can't hide.
Not from people like this,
with the resources they have.
You won't make it to sundown.
So, what does that leave you?
You can go public, sure.
You can go loud.
Call your sister, because
that worked out well for you.
Call some ex-roommate.
Call a guy that knows a guy
at The Washington Post.
Put it online.
'Cause you know what?
You blow me off, that's
the only play you've got.
But you'd better
ask yourself this.
Could you ever say it
loud enough or fast enough
that they'd be too afraid to
finish what they've started?
Now, I've got a plan, and it's
just not that complicated.
What I'm going to do is wait for the
next person to show up to kill you.
Maybe they can help me.
So, go for it.
I had no choice.
I had to get out of there.
No, I had to get out of there!
No, nobody. I have no idea.
You have to understand. All the
work at Outcome, all those tests,
the burn rates, dosage
panels, tissue stress.
I mean, that is us
tuning chemistry.
We don't fabricate anything.
That happens downstream.
Wait. What's that mean,
"downstream"?
It means you need live
virus to seed adhesion.
Cultures are highly reactive.
You have to process on-site
and we would never do it here.
Okay. On-site, where? Where?
Where do we hold the virus?
Yes!
Well, we can't drive there.
Where is it?
Manila.
The Philippines.
Where do you stand
with your dosage?
I have 300 milligrams of blues.
It's not even enough
for another day.
I haven't had
a full green in 51 hours,
which is strange because I don't
feel physically degraded.
But we'll see.
Wait, wait, wait.
Did you just say you're
still taking greens?
What are you talking about?
You were viraled off physical
medication last year.
What?
Jesus. They viraled everyone
off greens eight months ago.
They infected you
with live virus,
which means that,
physically, you're stable.
You don't need to take greens.
They locked it in.
Any physical enhancement
is now permanent.
So, you infected me?
When was this?
Is this when I was sick?
The mystery flu?
That was you?
Well, it wasn't me.
I didn't do it.
That was you. That was
on purpose, right?
When I almost died.
I'm sorry, but it wasn't me.
Why am I still taking
green pills, then?
I don't know.
I thought you had stopped.
Why am I asking you anything?
Or to keep us
on a leash, right?
Is that it?
To keep a hold on us?
To keep us dependent?
Who tells you
that this is okay?
No one... I do...
Who says it's okay?
I do research.
I design, I survey.
I don't administer meds.
I don't make policy!
No, you just load the gun.
Oh, God.
Look, I was there
for the science.
We were all there for science.
And I know you don't care,
but I made a huge sacrifice.
I couldn't publish,
I couldn't conference.
I couldn't tell a single
person what it was I did.
But I thought I was helping my
country, and I know that's...
Tell me you can
viral off blues.
Can you viral off blues?
Theoretically, yes.
Yeah.
Pills allow for temporary adhesion.
Okay.
To lock it in, you need live culture.
Live virus!
You know how to do that.
Do you know how to do that?
Yes.
Okay.
Yes, but I told you, it's on
the other side of the planet.
Well, guess where we're going?
WOMAN: Welcome to Washington. Welcome
to Candent World Headquarters.
We want to make sure
that over the next few days
you have a chance to connect with the
people who have made Sterisyn Morlanta
the crown jewel in the
Candent group of companies.
Final Phase 3 testing approval
is expected this month
for both reQuiel
and Supressolyn.
Confidence is high that we're coming in
on schedule, and we want to be ready.
We know the market is eager.
We know, globally,
the kind of...
What the hell don't
I know about this?
You're directing that at me?
That was a D-Trac team
we sent in there.
I don't know what that means.
It means they're
good at what they do.
I was told that
they were missing.
They don't just go missing.
What didn't you tell us
about this woman?
Nothing. She is who she is.
There's nothing to tell.
You vetted her up and down.
Then what the hell
are we looking at?
INGRAM: She has
a registered gun.
TURSO: They knew that
going in.
She's got building permits.
Propane, welding tanks.
A stray bullet?
You want to keep guessing?
We've got to get in there.
I've got a dozen people
waiting on the perimeter.
We don't control the site?
DITA: Not yet.
Getting the picture now?
Okay, stop!
I can't run this from here.
I need a crisis suite. I need
integrated grids and comms.
I need all of it.
NSA, or Pentagon,
or Liberty Crossing.
I don't care, just
get me something now.
Pack up your codes
and your drives,
and whatever else
you're going to need.
We're going to move
and we're going to stay there.
Dita, how am I putting a net over that house?
There's locals all over it.
We go with germs.
She took samples from work.
Pathogens, viruses.
It's national security.
Good, okay,
I like that, it plays.
Now, get it out there,
get it out there.
Come on, let's go, let's go.
Everybody find another gear, okay?
Because I want to
be out of here in 20.
MARTA: So, let's say you want
to change the human body.
You want to fix a mistake.
You want to repair something,
improve something.
Well, if you're going to reprogram
human genetic material,
you need a delivery system, and
nothing works better than virus.
It's like a suitcase.
You pack in genetic mutation,
infect the body and the vector
unloads into the target cells.
But getting it where you
want it, how you want it,
is the nightmare.
Unless you have a map.
There was this terrible accident
at Fort Detrick in 1985.
Five researchers dropped dead in the
lab, and it was such a catastrophe
that they brought in
Dan Hillcott
from Stanford
to assess the damage.
He got in there and he realized
that, underneath it all,
was this incredible breakthrough
in viral-receptor mapping.
He had a map.
You've had some
very minor alterations
made to two different
chromosomes.
The green side,
the physical side,
is nothing more
than a 1.5 percent rise
in your mitochondrial
protein uptake.
But with 1.5 percent,
you see this immediate
increase in cellular tempo,
muscle efficiency,
oxygenation...
And the blue side?
Intelligence, obviously,
but it's more than that.
It's neural regeneration
and elasticity.
Sensory function.
Pain suppression.
It's the most exciting
development in genomic targeting
in the history of the science.
My God.
Hey, how do I get monitor
Coming up.
They found a body.
They're pretty sure it's a woman,
and it's not Marta Shearing.
They found dog tags.
They think she was shot.
Hey.
Hey.
Marta, I...
You can't call anyone.
There are people that care about
you that think you're dead.
And there's nothing
you can do about it.
Anyone you contact
becomes a target.
So, you need to put aside any normal
emotional response that you have.
The only edge we've got right now
is they think we're both gone.
All right?
All right.
So,
you're going to want
to go through this.
You know, just
be familiar with it.
June Monroe.
Who is June Monroe?
You are.
Do you know her?
Not any more.
Why do you have
to stay enhanced?
Why is it so important to you?
Come here.
What is this?
This was me.
Was.
My army recruiter
was looking to make his quota.
He added 12 points to my IQ.
Twelve points to make
the minimum.
You ever seen a cognitive
degrade, Marta?
Sensory withdrawal?
You ever do that?
Pull someone's blues and watch
them drop off their meds?
No.
Because they paint a pretty
graphic picture in training.
Hell of a long way to fall.
If I can't keep it together,
we won't make it.
They bit.
Who?
We just flagged an email.
They're going with the story
about the possible theft
of the dangerous
materials from the lab.
Wow, they took it. They already
flagged a DWI conviction.
That's convenient.
They found another body.
One of ours.
They're picking up shell
casings all over the place.
I don't think your
doctor's in there.
Boarding pass and ID, please.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Boarding pass and ID, please.
Where are you?
AARON: I'm right behind you.
Don't turn around.
You're going to stay right here
until it's time to board, okay?
You're doing great.
You see that corridor
on your right?
You're gonna want
to find somebody
who's walking that way
and just tag along.
Keep moving,
keep your head down,
and I'll see you on the plane.
Aaron?
Hello?
The trail is
definitive and fresh.
The canine team
tracked her from her house
through this wooded area, ending
here, at this little parking lot.
Either she had a car waiting for
her, or somebody picked her up.
There are security cameras on the
street, but there's nothing back here.
There's got to be
satellite footage.
Maryland's not exactly
a high-value U.S. target.
There'll be plenty
of weather imaging,
but we're gonna have
to swing a little wider
to find something real-time
that's enhanceable.
We're draining some foreign platforms.
We need about an hour.
Come on, she's not pulling
this off on her own.
Who the hell is helping her?
MALE ANCHOR: We'll find out
more in the next hour,
while we are
currently in court.
JENN: The FBI this morning confirmed
reports that Dr. Albert Hirsch
died of heart failure
in a Washington, D. C. hotel.
Dr. Hirsch had been expected
to testify yesterday
before a Senate
Intelligence committee.
That select committee
is investigating links
between a troubled CIA program
known as Treadstone
Police and federal officials
are searching for Bourne
in connection with recent shootings
in New York and in London.
Dr. Hirsch had been cooperating
with the Justice Department
and was in protective custody
at the time of the incident.
A committee spokesman
told reporters last night
that the hearings will
be postponed temporarily
as they evaluate
the loss of Doctor...
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Hi, folks.
Just going to remind you
to keep the aisles clear
for any baggage
during takeoff and landing.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Pardon me, sir.
Sir, do you need
help finding your seat?
Sir?
No, I got it.
You see those two shadows? One of them is her.
That's the parking lot.
One of them stops.
Here comes the car.
Where is this from? DITA: It's
a Canadian forestry satellite.
INGRAM: Here comes the other one
into the car, and there they go.
Where?
DITA: We lose them east.
Our window drops out
about two miles up the road.
But we've got the silhouette.
We've got surveillance footage,
racked and ready to go.
We're going to split teams, find
this car and link up atrail.
With a 17-hour head start?
Where the hell can she go?
MAN 1: We're looking for
a Buick LeSabre 2002.
I've got an NIA/Homeland
warrant, that's why.
MAN 2: Well, you give us what you have...
MAN 3: Two passengers.
It's an '02 burgundy LeSabre
starting west from Lisbon, Maryland.
Tolls, exits, service stations.
Give me every
camera you've got.
I'm seeing an FBI camera
bin on my list here.
No, no. Traffic only.
West, Lisbon. L-I-S-B-O-N.
Yes, we want all of that and the toll cams.
We want everything.
We'll take them all. Whatever
hits you have, send them on.
We will work on
sorting them out.
DITA:
This is our car, the LeSabre. We
see it coming into the structure.
It goes under, comes back
around, and it parks here.
But it doesn't come out.
This is inside. It's four
minutes after arrival.
It's her.
Do we know what she's doing?
She was having her
passport picture taken.
DITA: Logan, Hartford, LaGuardia,
Kennedy, Philly, Newark,
Dulles, Reagan.
We start with yesterday
morning, that is our wedge.
We clear that, and then
we move up the clock.
She wants to know if you want
Hartford, because she can get it.
Blue coat, second row.
She's got a red bag.
Which one? I have four.
All right, I have TSA
Authorization 1, 6, 9 and 12.
Airports given, all departures.
Yes, the international
terminal first.
We're almost there.
DITA: So, check out
the newsstand.
There.
BYER: I don't know.
Logan has a face we need to
look at, but there's kids.
BYER: Hang on, hang on,
hang on. Hang on.
Stop.
Where is this?
Kennedy.
Okay.
I've never been here at night.
I don't know the rules.
There are no rules, okay?
We belong here.
Come on.
Hey, how are you?
Good evening.
Dr. Shearing and I are here
to open up the lab, please.
Sir?
What's all this?
Hi, how are you?
Dr. Shearing!
Dr. Shearing.
Hey, it's me, Joseph.
Joseph!
Hello, how are you?
I'm good, I'm good.
Welcome back.
Thanks.
I'm sorry. I just don't have
you on my list arriving.
That's because we had
to change our schedule.
Yeah, we took
an earlier flight.
Joseph, I'm Dr. Brundage, by the way.
It's nice to meet you.
Pleased to meet you, too, but Dr. Pumaloy
is not here, he went to Singapore.
He just left yesterday.
The girls have gone home.
No one told me anything.
Right. Well, I understand.
Well, look, we're going
to be here all week,
and we have
a lot of work to do,
so we need to get
in there tonight
and get things started, okay?
Yeah, of course,
it's just that...
You can call
Dr. Pumaloy if you want.
I just don't want to
put you on the spot.
No, we don't have to do that.
Okay, great.
It's just the two of you?
Yeah.
Yes, correct.
Correct.
Yes, I will hold.
Get it up there. Put that
up on the big screen.
Yes, I'm here.
Good. Where?
I need an immediate upload
on that passenger manifest.
I know. Here she is,
I'm putting her back on.
Manila. She took
American 167 to Manila.
She landed 45 minutes ago.
Aaron.
Are you okay?
BYER: There's 243 people
on that plane.
We're going to scope
every one of them right now.
So, pick a face that
you like, pull it down,
and deselect it if
you've cleared it.
If there is anything
that smells wrong to you,
if there's a hair out of
place that you don't like,
you do not clear it.
You flag it and you send it over
to Dita and we'll check it out.
We have to be working off the same grid.
That's Homeland 9.5.
If you don't pull that
access, raise your hand,
Colonel Hardy's going to
come over and sort you out.
So, this is it, huh?
Yeah.
Okay.
What the hell
are we into, Terry?
I don't know.
It's your shop.
What is going on over there?
What did I say?
I don't know.
Well, how many trips
has she made over there?
Five, six, I don't know.
Why the Philippines?
Hey, hey, hey!
INGRAM: Seat 13-B.
Karl D. Brundage, 13-B.
I need support staff
to clear the room.
Stand up and walk, now.
Jack, Cathy, move!
Let's go.
TURSO:
BYER: He's an Outcome agent.
That's Outcome 5.
TERRY: They're not dead?
I thought they were dead!
BYER: Yeah, he's
supposed to be dead.
TURSO:
BYER:
VENDEL: He's looking for meds.
TURSO: What?
That's where the chems come from.
What else would he be doing?
INGRAM: She's got
to be helping him.
TURSO: But how?
How is that possible?
BYER: I don't know how.
I don't care.
He's alive, they're there.
"How" doesn't
really matter, does it?
The only mission we've got now
is to drop a bag over this.
Are the drugs he's looking
for there, or not?
Jesus, I don't... Terry?
No. No, there's
nothing there.
We haven't made
a run in 16 weeks.
Besides, we wouldn't store
the pills there, anyway.
We tweak the recipe and we bake
up a batch when we need it.
Then what the hell
are they doing?
The stems are there.
She's going to try
to viral him out.
Thank you.
Mack.
Yeah?
Plant office, Mackie speaking.
TERRY: Mr. Mackie,
this is Terrance Ward.
I'm the Senior Vice-President
for Candent Precision Metrics.
I'm calling from Maryland.
Yes, sir.
We have a potential
security incident.
I just posted two photographs
on the company network.
I need to know if either of these
two people have tried to enter...
Excuse me?
Yeah, we're on the case. We're just here
now trying to figure out who to call.
Our gatehouse just
passed in two doctors.
I think one of them
might be that woman
from your
shoot-out over there.
We keep all of our
client labs downstairs,
so we're assuming they've
gone into the basement.
I just sent a couple of boys
down to check it out.
No, no. No, no,
withdraw your team.
Lock the lab and
keep them down there.
Do not try to take him.
MARTA: Hello?
GUARD: Hey, how you doing?
Can I help you?
Are you alone down here?
Aaron?
Hey, guys.
You can't be down here. Do you
have clearance for this level?
Nobody's supposed
to be down here.
I'm supposed to be down here.
I'm Dr. Shearing.
We're in the middle
of a sampling audit.
It is not safe for
you guys to be here.
Let's straighten
this out upstairs.
Don't touch that.
Pack it up, let's go.
Look, nobody touch anything.
Come on, just follow us.
I'm not going to sit here and argue with you.
I'm going to call your boss
and we're gonna figure it out.
Watch her.
Hey, hold on a second.
I'm going to get my bag.
We got to go.
Okay.
Wait. This way.
I don't know where this goes.
Just open it.
Step back.
Lock it down. Hey! You! You! With me!
Come on, come on, come on.
Is that locked?
Yes, sir.
No one in, no one out.
Do you understand?
Hey, what happened to those
three guys you sent downstairs?
Shit.
Come with me. You stay there, okay?
Stay there.
We belong here.
Coming through.
MACKIE: You, go and get everyone else.
Tell them to go around the front.
Go through the eastern doors,
move around the front.
MACKIE: Move! Move, people!
Who have you got on this radio?
Why is no one responding?
Is that gate shut?
Excuse me.
Move, move, move!
Hey! I need that gate shut!
Hey, you! Listen, go down to the main gate.
Do you understand?
No one in, no one out.
Hey, what are you doing?
Just get down to the main
gate with everyone else.
All right, get back!
Stay back!
Give him some room.
All right, give me some room.
Give me some room, please.
He's going to need a doctor.
Security. Security!
Over here, please.
Over here.
Sir, can you hear me? Sir!
He can't get far.
If he didn't viral out, he's
going to run out of brain.
And, if he did, then he's
going to be too sick to move.
So, we just have
to find him fast
and kill him, once and for all.
Can we talk about LARX?
LARX?
LARX-3 is in Bangkok.
It's atwo-hour flight.
Wait a minute.
Just hang on, here.
I thought that
was just a proposal.
Get him out there.
DITA: LARX is
a beta-Z stem program.
Amped mission fidelity,
minimized empathy.
VENDEL: It's Treadstone
without the inconsistency,
Outcome without
the emotional noise.
TERRY: It's looking
very strong for us.
We have never seen
evaluations like this.
This went from something
I don't know about
to something on
the drawing board,
and now you're telling me
it's up and running?
It's up and running.
Consider yourself informed.
DR. HILLCOTT:
Are you comfortable?
AARON: Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Kenneth James.
Full name, Kenneth.
Kenneth... James...
AARON:
They have a room.
Can you walk?
Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah. I think so.
DR. HILLCOTT: Where are
you from, Kenneth?
AARON:
Okay. Okay.
Okay, just lie still.
Aaron, you have... Aaron...
What?
There's $40,000 in
the lining of my jacket.
In this bag,
there are passports.
Two blanks and three ghosts,
there's that guy's watch.
There are other things, okay?
You take it.
Look at me.
You can make it.
You're a warrior.
You can make it.
Okay? Stay small.
No airports.
Just blend in
like you know, okay?
You've done enough for me.
No, I...
Please go.
You've done enough for me.
Everything's in the car.
AARON:
Paracetamol, 500 milligrams.
Four times a day.
For free. This is free.
Okay, good.
I'll be right back.
Aaron, run!
"Where are you?"
"Was that the signal?"
They're asking
for confirmation.
"You went too soon."
No... "We went too soon."
Come on.
It's okay.
Police! Police!
Get down!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Good. Come on.
Get down, get down.
Climb over.
Go. Get over,
get over, get over.
Get over. Hang on tight.
Go, go!
You ready? Let go!
Okay. Take this.
Just keep walking,
don't look back. Go, go.
Hey, hey. Get on.
You ever ridden before?
No.
Take this.
Police, police!
Hang on tight and
follow me, okay?
Stay with me.
He's got a gun!
Keep your head down.
It's not a cop.
Aaron!
You've been shot.
It's all right.
Pull over!
Pull over.
We just have to
get to the water.
DITA: Can you
check that for me?
VENDEL: How long is
that going to take?
Come on.
DITA: We'll get
back to you.
Anything?
No.
VENDEL: The cops are out.
They lost the trail.
Aaron!
Aaron! Aaron! Aaron! Aaron!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Can you help us?
Please.
Should be up there now.
He said it's the room
where they spent the night.
PAULSEN: Well, we had a problem
with Treadstone six years ago.
The Blackbriar program,
detailed in the operations
report you have before you,
was activated solely to capture
a Treadstone operative
gone rogue.
WOMAN: Pam, what are
you going to do?
We have nothing for you now.
I don't know
Pamela Landy's reasons
for criminally assisting an
enemy of the United States.
But the fact is, she lacked
the operational clearance
to access, much less interpret,
the information you have
in the classified
file before you.
MAN: Pam, there's a rumor that you're
going to be indicted, is it true?
Mike, can you comment? WOMAN:
Have you been subpoenaed?
ATTORNEY: We're here voluntarily.
We came for a meeting.
WOMAN: Have you had any
contact with Jason Bourne?
MAN: Did you receive
a target letter or not?
Are we going to
see you tomorrow?
VOSEN: I just thank God that
there were hands steady enough
to make sure that the documents
she tried to shop to the press
were contained
before they could
do any more harm
than they already have.
WOMAN: Are you still scheduled to appear
at the House Intelligence Committee?
Yes, I am. Look, anything else is going
to have to come from my attorneys, okay?
MAN: Do you regret your
earlier statement?
I regret a lot of things. I'm not
sure that one is on the list.
Thank you, guys.
Hey.
Hey.
Are we lost?
No.
Just looking at our options.
I was kind of hoping
we were lost.
