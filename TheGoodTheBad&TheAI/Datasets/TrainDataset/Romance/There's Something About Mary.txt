*His friends would say,
stop whinin'*
* They've had enough
of that *
*His friends would say,
stop pinin'*
* There's other girls
to look at *
* They've tried to set him up
with Tiffany *
* And Indigo *
* But there's somethin'
about Mary *
* That they don't know *
* Mary *
* There's just somethin'
about Mary *
* Well, his friends say *
* Look,
life's no fairy tale *
* That he should
have some fun *
* He's suffered
long enough *
* Well, they may know
about domestic *
* And imported ale *
* But they don't know
a thing about love *
* Well, his friends
would say he's dreamin' *
* And livin' in the past *
* But they've never
fallen in love *
* So his friends
need not be asked *
* His friends would say,
be reasonable *
* His friends would say,

about Mary *

Ted: When I was 16 years old,
I fell in love.
Ted: When I was 16 years old,
I fell in love.
Hey, Renise.
Hey.
So, uh, what's up?
Ah-uh.
Cool.
So I was wondering...
I don't know, uh...
if... if maybe you
wanted to, and... or not.
If you don't want to,
you don't have to.
I just wondered if maybe
you were going to the prom...
and... or, uh...
if you felt like that,
maybe you'd want to go...
with me.
Or, I mean, whatever.
If... if you didn't.
Did you take that bio test?
'Cause that was like...
Look, I heard this rumor...
that this guy I like
was gonna ask me...
so I'm gonna wait and
see what happens there.
That sounds great.
Yeah.
Ok.
So, is that like
a yes or a no or...
I thought I made it
perfectly clear.
If everything else
falls apart...
maybe.
I'm gonna hold you
to that.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Mary!
Oh, I wonder who
she's going with.
Ted: Her name was Mary.
She moved to our little
Rhode Island town...
from Minnesota
Ha. What a fox.
I heard she's going with
some guy named Woogie.
Ah.
Who?
Big guy. Goes
to Barrington High.
Woogie from
Bore-rington High?
Sounds like a loser.
Loser? Woogie's only
like All-State football...
and basketball,
and fucking valedictorian.
I heard he got a scholarship
to Princeton...
but he's going to
Europe first to model.
Yeah? I was thinking
of doing that.
Sorry.
Have you... have you...
have you seen
my baseball?
Uh, no. Sorry, man.
Haven't seen it.
Have you... Have you
seen my baseball?
Sorry.
Hey, check it out.
Have you seen
my baseball?
Hey, buddy.
Come here.
I think I know
where your ball is.
You've seen
my baseball?
Yeah, yeah.
I've seen it.
You see that girl
over there?
That... that...
She has it, except she
doesn't call it a baseball.
She's got another name
for it.
Nice muffs.
Have you seen
my... wiener?
What?
Have you seen
my wiener?
What the... What the hell
did you just say, buddy?
Huh?
Wiener?
Hey, get your hand
off my car!
What the hell did you
just say to me?
My... my...
My... my...
- Huh?
- Wiener.
Fuckin'
son of a bitch.
I'm gonna fuckin'
kick your ass.!
Get up, fat boy!
Let's go!
Take it easy.
Keep your hands off.
Who the fuck
are you?
The guy's not all there,
all right?
Crowd: Fight! Fight!
Get out of my face.
You want
the first punch?
Yeah! Fight!
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!
What's the matter
with you? Stop it!
Crowd: Aww.
You ok, Warren?
Mary, have you seen
my baseball?
No, I haven't seen
your baseball.
What are you doing
leaving the yard?
You know you're not supposed
to leave by yourself.
You know him?
He's my brother.
I'm her brother.
Warren.
I didn't realize,
you know?
You ought to tell him
to watch his mouth.
Jerk.
Are you ok?
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
You ok?
Thanks, Ted.
Ted: I couldn't believe
that she knew my name.
Some of my best friends
didn't know my name.
I think thatJoe Montana...
is, like, the most
underrated quarterback.
I mean, he should have been
a first-round draft pick.
Look what he did
at Notre Dame.
It's so ridiculous.
Exactly.
I'm telling you, this year,
it's the 49ers. 49ers.
All the way.
Piggyback ride!
Piggyback!
Warren, stop it.
Leave Ted alone.
No, that's ok.
I'll do it.
If you think
he can hold me.
Are you kidding?
He's 230 pounds.
He can hold you.
You don't have to.
It's ok. I got
a little disk thing...
but it's all right.
All right, here we go!
Giddyup, Warren!
There we go! Whoo!
Fun, huh, Warren?
He's a real Clydesdale,
isn't he?
Yeah, Warren,
buckin' bronco.
My turn now.
- Oh.
- My turn.
Ok. Well, I don't...
Ohh!
It's ok, Ted.
You don't have to.
Giddyup!
Mary: That's good. Whoo!
That's fun, huh, Warren?
Whoa!
Ted: Uhh!
Whoa!
That was fun.
He's only 230, huh?
Yeah.
I'm in the yard now.
I'll hide.
Ok, go hide.
He's got
a lot of energy.
Yeah. He's great. I have
a lot of fun with him.
Well...
Thanks for
walking us back.
Yeah, no problem.
I'm, uh,
I'm just gonna...
So, are you... Are you
going to the prom?
Huh?
Uh, oh. Uh...
l... I don't...
I think proms are...
'Cause I thought
maybe we, um...
- Dumb.
- We could go together.
Oh, you're gonna go with,
like, a bunch of people?
It's like... yeah. You want,
like, a designated driver.
No, no.
I mean, you and me.
Like, we could go together.
The two of us.
You... you and me?
Yeah.
Well, is that
a yes or a no?
Sure. Ha.
All right.
Good.
Cool...
I'm gonna take
Warren back inside.
I'll... I'll see you
at school.
Cool. I'll catch you
back at school.
Ted: From that moment on...
the guys at school looked
at me in a whole new light.
You're a fuckin' liar.
Do you expect us
to believe...
that you're going
to the prom with Mary?
What's so crazy
about that?
Oh, yeah, dirt bud...
and I'm going
with Cyndi Lauper.
What happened
to Woogie?
She said she
broke up with him...
that he was getting
weird on her.
I got 20 bucks that says
you're full of shit.
Why not make it 100?
Rock on.
I'm in.
Me, too.
*So when you find
somebody who gives *
* Think of me
and celebrate *
*I made such
a big mistake *
* When I was Mary's prayer *
*So if I say *
*Save me, save me *
*Be the light in my eyes *
I've already paid him
enough money already.
I'm not paying until
thejob gets done.
He can kiss my ass.
What the hell
do you want?
Uhh!
I'm Ted Stroehmann. I'm here
to take Mary to the prom.
Prom? Mary went to
the prom 20 minutes ago...
with her boyfriend
Woogie.
Woogie?
Woogie!
Oh.
I see.
Charlie,
you are so mean.
This is Mary's
stepfather Charlie.
I'm Sheila her mother.
Ted, don't pay any attention
to anything he says.
He's a laugh a minute.
Ho. Very funny.
Well, I'm just having
a little fun with the guy.
It's prom night.
Woogie's got
a sense of humor.
Oh, hey. Hi, Warren.
Oh, listen, once he
gets into that MTV...
he'll be there
for quite a while.
Oh, here she comes.
Oh, here she comes.
Oh, honey,
you look beautiful.
Aw, shit, look at that.
You better
be careful, boy.
Hi, Ted.
Hi, Mary.
You look really... pretty.
Thanks.
I like your colors.
Oh, thanks. The guy said
it was tan and taupe.
Poor Ted, he's been
getting it both barrels...
from the wisenheimer here.
Dad, you haven't been
bustin' Ted's chops...
have ya?
I was just fucking with him.
Right, Ted?
Hey, Warren, did you
say hi to Ted?
About 10 times.
Ok.
Hey, Warren. I think
I found your baseball.
You've seen my baseball?
Well, if it's
a big white one.
With, uh...
little red stitching.
Yup. It is.
Hmm. Then I think
I saw it...
right behind your ear.
Aah!
Charlie: Warren! Warren!
Hold it, hold it!
Get up, Warren!
Hey, Warren!
Warren!
Be careful, Mary!
Be careful!
Get up, man!
Let go of him!
Get down from there!
What are you doing?
Ted! Ted!
Warren, put him down!
Ted: Whoa! Ohh!
What the hell
are you doing?
Mary, Mary.
This is my house here.!
Warren,
are you ok, buddy?
It's ok, Warren.
It's ok.
Here you go.
What the hell's
the matter with you?
I was just trying to
give him the baseball.
Baseball?
What baseball?
I had a baseball.
What baseball?
There was...
It's right...
There was a baseball here.
I swear, I brought him
a baseball...
and I was just trying
to give him a present!
Are you yelling at me
in my own house?
No.
Don't make me open a can
of whup-ass on you.
Ted, I should
have told you.
He has a thing
about his ears.
You're all right,
Warren?
Oh, honey,
your strap's broken.
Ohh.
All right.
Hey, Ted, I'm just gonna
go upstairs real quick.
I just need 2 minutes.
I got to fix my dress.
I'll help you, honey.
Hey, I, uh...
Can I use your bathroom?
I'm sorry. I got to...
He broke the table.
You son of a bitch.
Warren:
I didn't do it.
It's ok, Warren.
It's ok.
Ted:
I swear...
The bathroom
is that way.
Maybe I'll open up
a can of whup-ass on him.
Trying to do
the kid a favor.
* Why do birds *
*Suddenly appear *
*Every time *
* You are near? *
*Just like me *
* They long to be *
Ted: Hmm?
Sheila: Ohh.!
Is he looking at you?
What is he...
Oh, no. L...
- Oh!
-
No, no, I was...
Mary: Mom, wait.!
Ted: Shit!
Ow!
Aah.!
Aah.! Aah.!
Mary: Ted, are you ok?
Ted: Yeah, I'm fine.!
Everything's ok.!
Ok, ok,
just take your time.
It's all right.
He's been in there
over a half an hour.
Charlie, I think
he's masturbating.
- Oh, come on!
- Mom!
Well...
He's not masturbating.
Well, he was
watching you undress...
with a silly grin
on his face.
Ted: I was
watching the birds.!
Do something.
What do you
want me to do?
I think he needs
some male help.
Oh, for crying
out loud.
Dad, just give
him a minute.
Ok, kid, listen,
I'm coming in, ok?
No, no. Don't...
Exactly what the hell
is the situation here?
What did you do, shit
yourself or something?
Oh, I wish. L...
I got it stuck.
You got what stuck?
It!
Oh! It. Um...
Um, uh, well, um...
listen, uh...
it's not the end
of the world.
These kind of
things happen. Uh...
uh, let's have
a look at it.
Oh, my God
in Heaven save him!
Shh! Shh!
Shush.
Quiet.
Uh, Sh-Sheila.
No.
Sheila, uh, honey?
Ted: Don't.
Sheila, honey...
uh, you gotta
come here.
You gotta
see this.
What is it?
What? No?!
Don't! Don't!
Don't worry.
She's a dental hygienist.
She'll know
exactly what to do.
- Hi, Ted.
- Hi, Mrs. Jensen.
How are you?
You ok?
Yeah.
Holy shit!
Mrs. Jensen: Charlie,
you could have warned me.
Ok, I, um...
Mrs. Jensen, l...
Right, right. Ok.
I don't want her to hear,
you know?
Ok. Um, let's just
relax here, ok?
Now, uh, uh...
what exactly
are we, uh...
Iooking at here, huh?
What do you mean?
Look at the...
I mean, is it
the, um...
or the...
Is it the frank
or the beans?
Oh, I, uh,
l... I don't know.
It looks like... I think
it's a little bit of both.
Warren: Franks and beans.!
Franks and beans.!
Mary: Shh.! No.!
Shh, shh.!
Well, what's
that bubble there?
What do you think?
It's a...
Well, how the hell...
did you get the beans
above the frank?!
Shush, shush.
I don't know.
It wasn't like it was
a well-thought-out plan.
There really does seem
to be an awful lot...
of skin coming
through there...
so I'm gonna find
some Bactine, honey.
Uh, no. You know what?
I don't need any. Really.
Hello there.
Oh, Christ.
What the hell's
going on here?
Neighbors said they heard
a lady scream.
Uh, well, you're
looking at him.
Uh, you gotta take
a look at this.
Would you just...
Oh, Jesus.
Charlie:
Ain't it a beaut?
What the hell...
Huh?
...were you thinking?
How the hell did you
get the zipper...
all the way to the top?
Let's just say
the kid's limber.
Ow!
Ow!
Christ.
What the...
God...
Somebody's gonna have to
move that station wagon...
so I can get the truck
in here.
Officer: Lenny, come here.
Ohh...
Take a look...
at what
this num-nuts did.
Holy shit!
Mike, Eddie.
Get down here quick.
Bring everybody.
Bring a camera.
You're not gonna
believe this!
We got a kid down here...
What's your name?
No, I...
No, there's only
one thing to do here.
What? No. You know what?
I got an idea.
Look, look.
I can just...
You don't have
to do anything...
'cause, look, I can just
wear this over the front.
Look, I can go to the prom.
We'll deal with it later.
Son, relax.
You already
laid the tracks.
That's
the hard part.
Now we're just
gonna back it up.
Sheila: Teddy, be brave.
It's just like
pulling off a band-aid.
A one...
and a 2...
and a...
We got a bleeder!
Keep pressure on it.
Keep it on.
Everybody
get out of the way.!
Step clear,
gentlemen, please.
Warren:
He was masturbating!
Medic: People, please
move out of the way.
Charlie:
Warren, come here.
Warren:
He was masturbating.!
Move out of the way.
Charlie: None of this
ever happened to Woogie.!
Mary:
Are you ok, Ted?
Aah.!
Ted!
Warren:
He was masturbating.!
Aah.
Ohh.
Ted, are you
all right?
Sure.
Aah.
Oh.
Mary: Ok.
Ok, Ted.
Ok, let's roll.
All right, folks,
let's go. It's over.
So, anyway, uh...
school ended
a couple days later...
and her father
got transferred...
to Florida in July.
So I worked all summer...
to pay off those debts
and...
Well, I never saw Mary
again.
That was... what?
That's very interesting.
Anyway...
I know it's not the type
of thing you'd forget...
but I guess I just...
I kinda...
I must have blocked it
out of my head or something...
'cause I was driving down
the highway last week...
and I started thinking
about Mary...
and all of a sudden...
it was like
I couldn't breathe.
I mean, I was... I was...
I felt like
I was gonna die.
So I pulled off the road...
and I just sorta stopped
in this...
I guess
it was a rest area.
I was just
kind of shaking and...
You know...
rest areas are
homosexual hangouts.
Highway rest areas.
They're the bathhouses of the '90s
for many, many, many gay men.
So what... what are you...
What are you saying?
Oop. Time, she's up.
We'll, uh, delve into that next week.
and writers are artists.
And most artists
are a little foofy, you know.
A little foofy.
Thanks for the support.
Hey, you guys, I thought
you might like these with your beers.
Yes, indeed. Ted, help yourself.
I don't think I'll have one.
- You don't want one?
- No.
You want something else?
Come on.
You want something to eat?
Not hungry, thank you.
You want a cookie, something like that?
Honey, we got cookies?
Uh, no, we don't,
but I could bake some.
No, no, no. Don't bake any.
No, that's a good idea.
Why don't you bake some?
Bake some tollhouses.
Oh, great. Yeah, yeah.
- Uh, chocolate chip or butterscotch?
- Let's go with the chocolate chip.
- OK. Good.
- Really, you don't...
No, it's fine. Don't worry.
She loves this kind of thing.
Really?
See, that's great.
That's what I want,
a family,
and somebody to, you know...
It must be wonderful
having all this, huh?
Each day is better than the next.
How about you?
The big "L." Hmm?
- Ever been?
- What?
In
Well,
once.
Mary.
Oh, God. Not Mary again.
Look, I know it was brief,
but it was
it was definitely love, Dom.
I mean,
crushes don't last for 13 years, right?
What ever happened to Mary?
- She moved with her family to Miami.
- So why don't you look her up?
I did
once.
I called. She wasn't listed.
So that's it? You get one little bump
in the road and give up?
It's probably for the best.
After 13 years,
she's probably gonna think
I'm a stalker or something.
You know what you should do
is hire a private investigator.
You know, to find her, follow her around.
She won't know anything.
No way! That's way too creepy.
Besides, she's probably married
with a couple of kids by now.
Girls like Mary...
they don't stay single.
Hey, I've got an idea.
There's this guy down in my office.
His name's Healy.
He's a claims investigator.
He's a hell of a bloodhound.
He goes to Miami every couple of weeks.
He can help you out.
This guy runs a little hot,
but he gets the job done.
So.
Dom says you're looking for some
lady friend you knew back at school.
Yeah. Yeah.
That's cute.
I don't buy it, but it's cute.
You're not buying what?
Ted, I'm the kind of guy
who likes to shoot from the hip.
Ahem.
I want you to level
with me.
Come on, let's talk.
Did you knock
this skirt up? Huh?
No.
She's blackmailing you,
right?
Blackmailing me?
No.
You want her dead,
don't you?
Dead?
Were you...
You're not serious,
are you?
You expect me to believe...
this is a straight
stalker case? Come on!
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm not a stalker.
I'm not a stalker, all right?
- She's a friend of mine.
- Oh, sure she is!
That explains why she's got
an unlisted number,
and you haven't heard squat
from her in 13 years.
Yeah. A real chum.
You're good, Ted.
Real piece of work.
You know what? Forget it.
Just forget the whole thing.
OK, I'll do it.
But if this chick turns up with a toe tag,
I'm rolling over on you, big guy.
All right.
Healy, you dog.
Sully!
Look at you.
You hot shit, you look fucking pisser.
Hey. Hey, good fella.
Does he bite?
A little bit.
Get in.
Here's the info you asked for.
Thanks.
Yeah, you should thank me.
That girl was not easy to find.
What, she scam you out
of some insurance dough?
Nah. Some guy gave me a couple bucks
to track down his high school girlfriend.
Stalker, huh?
Yep. Big time.
Healy: Ahh.
Looks like we found
your Mary, Ted.
Husband... negative.
Children and a Labrador...
negative.
Tight little package...
affirmative.
Good morning, Magda.
- Hi, doll. You're in my light.
- Sorry.
So you been out here all night again?
You bet your ass I have.
This is an importantjob,
Neighborhood Watch is.
Ah. Neighborhood Watch.
Is that what we're calling it?
Listening to perfect strangers'
telephone conversations.
This only picks up cellular phones
in a half a mile radius.
Meaning?
Meaning these are the people
you live amongst.
You got a right to know
if they're creeps.
For instance, you know the guy
in the green house down the street?
Cheating on his wife.
And I am not surprised.
I am not surprised at all.
Because Puffy used to bark his balls off
whenever he saw him.
And you know that Puffy,
he only barks at the bad people.
OK.
Listen, I'm gonna go hit some golf balls,
and hook up with Warren,
so... try to get some sleep.
OK.
- Bye, doll.
- Bye.
Hey, Herb. How's it going?
Apple for you today.
Thanks, Mary.
Have a good day. See you later.
Lookin' good, honey.
Hi, Mary.
Hey, Mrs Bailey. How you doing?
Looks like we got ajock on our hands.
Hey, you want the sports page?
Sure. Thank you.
Take care now.
Bye, you guys. See ya.
Yeah. Can I have two, Mary?
Yeah, you can have two halves,
just like everybody else.
Mmm.
Yeah, it's good.
Will you marry me, Mary?
Oh, I would love to, Jimmy,
but, um, I'm already engaged to Freddie.
Who's Freddie? Me?
Yeah, that's you.
Will you marry me?
What about Dolores?
You gonna marry us both?
I'm gonna kiss you.
I think you're making out
pretty well there.
OK.
Thanks, Mary.
You're welcome, Zack.
- No onions.
- No onions.
No onions.
No onions. How you doing?
Listen to this one:
"Seeking sensitive
WASP doctor...
"to share
candlelit dinners...
"long walks
in Coconut Grove...
marriage."
Is she looking
for a corpse?
You have to be specific
when you write those.
You have to say
"Seeking deaf mute...
"with," you know...
"3-pound cock
and trust fund."
I want a guy
who can play 36 holes...
and still have enough energy...
to take me and Warren
to a ball game...
and eat hot dogs.
I'm talking
sausage hot dogs, beer.
Not light beer, but beer.
That's my ad. Print it up.
Mmm.
Fatty who likes beer
and golf.
Jeez, Mary...
where you gonna find
a gem like that?
Ok, well,
here's the catch...
He has to be
self-employed.
Like a drug dealer?
No, I was thinking
along the lines, maybe...
of somebody like...
an architect
or something.
But I want somebody with
freedom in theirjob...
you know?
Somebody who can do it
anywhere...
and just leave
at a drop of a hat.
And where would you and
your beer-bellied architect...
be going to?
Mmm.
Super Bowl?
That's good.
I don't know.
Maybe a few months
in Nepal.
Mm-hmm.
And you'd probably dump
the poor guy...
halfway to Katmandu.
What's that supposed
to mean?
It means you change
your mind too much.
No, I don't.
Oh, come off it,
Mary.
Remember that gorgeous
corn-fed white-boy honey...
that you just dumped
like yesterday's garbage.
What was his name?
Pack man.
Ok. We had fun
for a while.
Mary, cut the crap.
What really happened
with Brett?
Yeah.
Brett seemed so sweet.
You know what Tucker
said Brett told him?
He said that if Warren
wasn't in my life...
that he would have
popped the question...
a long time ago.
- Oh.
- What a schmuck.
To hell with Brett, you know?
I've got a vibrator.
Shh!
Oh, ho-ho, yeah.
Ho ho.
Here comes the money shot.
Aah!
First chink in the armor, Ted.
Ohh.
Shit.
Ohh, yeah.
Pop, you wanna get me a whisky sour
when you get a sec?
Whisky sour coming up.
Got some excellent news
for you, my friend.
Oh, yeah? Excellent?
I think your life's about to change.
Really?
So... so you found her?
Oh, yeah.
And you were right, man.
She really is something else.
My God.
Really?
So... so she hasn't
she hasn't changed at all, huh?
Well, that I couldn't say.
Let me ask you something.
Was Mary a little big-boned
back in high school?
Big-boned? No, no. Not at all. No.
I guess she packed on
a few pounds over the years.
Oh, yeah. So she's a little...
she's a little chubby?
Oh, I'd say about a deuce,
deuce and a half. Not bad.
Oh, my. A deuce and a half.
You shit out a bunch of kids,
and you're bound to put on a few pounds.
Oh, so she's, um
she's married?
No, no. She's never been.
That's the good news.
Huh?
Four kids, three different guys,
but no rock.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too.
Tough to keep up with
in a wheelchair, I bet.
She's in a wheelchair?
Mary's in a wheelchair?
I thought that was part of your kick.
Excuse me, I ordered a whisky sour.
Whatever.
Are you sure it's the same Mary?
Oh, yeah. It's Mary all right.
The brother Warren?
Hey, don't look so shocked, Ted.
It's been a long time.
I bet you've changed a lot
the last 13 years.
What, do you think
your shit don't stink?
No, I don't think...
I... I mean, yes, it doe...
OK, I got all
the information you need.
I got it off her bookie.
Nice guy.
You really should
look her up, Ted.
I mean, she's a real
spark plug, this one.
Well, thank you.
Thanks, Healy.
Good work.
Uh, Ted...
don't you want the name
of the housing project?
What?
Man on TV:
...for 1,995.
See the Sarone boys on Route 1
in South Attleboro...
and right here...
on Jefferson Boulevard
in Warwick...
* Well, it hurts
from the bottom *
*And it hurts
down to your soul *
* That's because *
* True love is not nice *
*And it brings up hurt *
*From when
you were 5 years old *
* That's because *
* True love is not nice *
*No *
* Oh, pain, pain, pain *
*Ain't that
just love's name? *
*Love can bring up hurt *
*From way down low *
*It now be emphasized *
* True love
is just not civilized *
* True love is not nice *
* No, no *
Where are you goin'?
Huh?
Oh, I resigned.
Good luck in Miami, Pat.
Miami?
What... What are you
doing in Miami?
Uh, I took a, uh,
job offer.
With who?
With, uh...
Rice-A-Roni.
Isn't that
the San Francisco treat?
It was.
They're changing
their image.
Yeah, well, listen...
I've been thinking
about what you said.
Good, good.
And, uh, I still want
to look her up.
Who?
Roller pig?
Are you nuts?
I thought you said she was
a real spark plug.
Hmm? No, no.
I said butt plug.
She's heinous.
You know what?
All the same, I think
I'm gonna call her.
I mean, I know
it sounds crazy...
but, you know... I don't know.
Maybe I can help her out.
I just... I feel bad,
you know?
The poor thing,
she's in a wheelchair...
for God's sakes.
It's... It's a bunion.
It'll heal.
Bunion? You... What...
I thought...
You know what?
That's not even it.
The point is, I just...
I know this doesn't
make sense to you...
but I can't just
turn it off that fast.
I guess I still
have feelings for her.
This girl really means
something to you, huh?
All right.
Tell you what...
I'll get you her number...
just as soon as she
gets back from Japan.
Thank you. I'd apprec...
Japan? What is...
What's happening in Japan?
Why is she
going toJapan?
Oh, uh, you've heard
of mail order brides...
haven't you?
Well, they go
that way, too.
Mary's a...
What... What,
are they desperate?
She's a whale!
Don't forget.
It's a sumo culture.
They pay
by the pound there.
It's sorta like, uh,
sorta like tuna.
Well, what happened to...
you said she was single.
What happened.
Remember? No rock.
You had your window, Ted.
You blew it.
I had my window?
I'm sorry, buddy.
It's just...
Y'know, you're taking
this all wrong, ok?
I mean, come on.
You're liberated.
I feel liberated.
I mean, you know...
here you've been
in therapy, you know...
thinking you blew it...
with the greatest
girl ever...
and, really,
it turns out...
that getting your dick
stuck in your zipper...
was the best thing that
ever happened to you.
Ted: You wanna say it
a little louder?
I'm sorry, but it was.
I never told you that.
Well, Christ, Ted,
I was only 4 towns away.
Excuse me.
Oh, sure, sweetheart.
Oh, man, I gotta go.
I gotta get up
at 6 A.M. Tomorrow...
and help my boss' brother
move into his new apartment.
Your boss' brother?
Who's that?
I don't even know.
I never met him.
Uh-huh. Y'know, Ted, you
gotta finish that novel...
so you can quit
that stupid magazine.
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
Nice swing.
Christ! Hit a house!
I haven't swung
the wrenches in a while.
Would you mind givin' me
some pointers here?
Yeah. Sure. Don't talk
in someone's backswing.
Oh, thanks.
I'm gonna go get a soda.
You want one?
No, thanks.
Oh, uh, look, I'm sorry
to bother you again...
but, uh... you got
change of a dollar?
No.
All I got are these
damn Nepalese coins.
You've been to Nepal?
Hmm?
Oh, uh,
not... not in months.
I don't even know why
I bought the damn place.
Nice meeting you again.
You, too... again.
So what's your name?
Pat Healy.
Hmm.
Want to know mine?
I already know it, Mary.
How did you know that?
'Cause it's right there
on your golf bag.
Aw, damn!
Wow. Are... Are those
blueprints?
Oh, these?
They're just some, uh,
projects I'm working on.
Museum...
hospital for kids.
Really?
Are you an architect?
Just till I get my,
uh, PGA tour card.
No. I mean...
are they, um, putting up
some sort of a new museum...
in town, or is it...
Well, to tell you
the truth...
I'm sort of burnt out
on talkin' about it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just a job, really.
You know, something
to keep me moving.
My real passion
is my hobby.
Really? What's that?
I work with retards.
Isn't that a little
politically, um, incorrect?
Well,
the hell with that.
No one's gonna tell me...
who I can and can't
work with, right?
No. I mean...
We got this one kid...
Mongo.
He's got a forehead...
like a drive-in
movie theater...
but he's
a good ship...
so we don't bust
his chops too much.
So one day, Mongo
gets out of his cage...
What, they keep him
in a cage?
Well, it's... it's
just an enclosure...
No, but they
keep him confined.
Right, yeah.
That's bullshit!
Well,
that's what I said!
So I went out...
and I got him, um,
I got him a leash.
A leash!
Yeah,
one of those ones...
you can hook onto
the clothesline...
and he can run
back and forth.
And, uh, there's
plenty of room...
for him to... to dig
and, uh, play.
That kid has really, uh...
he's really blossomed,
you know?
Now I can, uh,
take him to movies.
Baseball games.
Fun stuff.
Yeah.
Sounds cool.
Oh, yeah,
it's cool for them...
but for me it's
much more than that.
For me,
it's... it's heaven.
Y'know?
Those goofy bastards
are just about...
the best thing I've
got goin' in this...
crazy world.
Hey, dipshit, be careful
with that thing, will you?
What?
You heard me.
You already put
a fuckin' nick in my piano.
Well, I'll try to be
a little more careful.
What are you, a baby?
You wimpin' out on me?
It's just that this is
a little bit heavy...
that's all.
What if the families
don't want a class action?
Oh, God! That's what
I've been trying to explain...
to you people
for the last hour!
Ok, fine.
We'll go over it again.
Mary's a fox!
What?
Mary's a fox?
What do you...
Hey, folks. Here, let's...
We'll break up. We'll
spitball this tomorrow.
Ok?
What the hell
are you talking about?!
Mary? My Mary?
Uh-huh.
She's not in Japan.
She has no rugrats
running around.
My friend says
she's a fox.
A surgeon fox.
I don't get it.
I mean Healy...
Think about it!
He never even looked
her up down there!
He was there
closing his deal...
with the Rice-A-Roni
people the whole time!
What's up
with your head?
Huh? Oh. L... I get hives
tap-dancing for these idiots.
I get a little
stressed-out.
Jeez. You know,
I feel like a royal shit...
because I set you up
with this guy.
You know what you gotta do.
You gotta call her.
Fuck calling her.
I'm goin' down there.
Yeah, yeah, ok.
ASAP.
So, who's the lucky guy?
His name is Pat.
I met him
at the driving range.
Is he good-looking?
He's no Steve Young.
So, what is he like?
I don't know.
Kind of a mook.
A schlep.
Magda: Why the hell
you going out with him...
if he's a schlep?
It's not like that,
Magda.
You know, it's...
it's like that movie
Harold and Maude.
Aw...
I don't watch
the new ones.
Well, you should
because it's probably...
the greatest love story
of our time.
The point is...
is that love isn't about...
money or social standings...
or age.
It's about 2 people
connecting...
having something in common...
you know, kindred spirits.
Fuck kindred spirits.
My little Puffy here
is going to tell you...
everything you need
to know about that guy...
in about 2 seconds flat.
If Puffy starts
yapping, uh-uh.
He's a loser.
If he likes him...
honey, then you've got
yourself a keeper.
Yeah.
Lover ball likes it
when I rub his belly.
That is amazing.
He doesn't like anybody.
He never usually
likes guys.
He doesn't like
bad guys.
Is that right?
I can tell that
you're an animal nut.
You are, aren't you?
You got me pegged.
You know, in Nepal...
the villagers there
called me...
Kin Ton Ti...
which means...
"noble man who is loved
by many animal...
who, in kind,
he loveth, too."
Would you like a cup
of tea or something?
I'd love a brewski
if you got one.
We can do that.
Hey, Magda...
why don't you help me
in the kitchen?
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Certainly.
Of course.
Kin Ton Ti.
Puffer doesn't like
bad guys, does he?
Heh heh heh.
Puffer?
Puffer?
Puffer,
come on, boy.
Would you like a little
clam dip, doll?
Pat: Uh, no, thank you.
I'd love a bundt cake
if you have one.
- Bundt cake?
- Bundt cake?
Hey, Pat, do you
want a, um...
a Budweiser
or a Heinie?
Uh, yeah, whatever.
Come on, Puffer!
Stay away
from the light!
Ok, I'll just get you
a regular.
Uhh!
All set?
Ohh.
Oh, good pooch.
All we had
were some Oreos.
How does that sound,
honey?
Oh, my God.
He's got him wrapped up
like a baby.
He was...
he was a little chilly.
Well, here we are.
- The museum?
- Yeah.
- I thought we were going to dinner.
- First, I have a surprise.
- Surprise?
- It's the architecture exhibit.
- Architecture exhibit?
- Yeah.
- I got to eat something or I get the shakes.
- Come on. We'll eat in 20 minutes.
My friend Tucker is upstairs and I want you
to meet him. He's an architect, too.
- Come on.
- Architect?
Yeah.
Tucker.
This is amazing.
It just blows me away.
What do you think this falls under?
Is this Art Deco, or is it Art Nouveau?
Uh...
Deco.
- Deco, yeah.
- Yeah.
It's beautiful.
Is this... OK.
Is this a vestibule, or is it a portico?
What is the difference
between the two?
Uh, when you're looking
at architecture,
try to visualize the buildings
as a whole, you know?
Uh, try to see them
in their natural state, in their
totalitarian... ism,
so to speak.
Stone crab time.
- Let's go to Joe's, huh?
- Hey, Tucker.
Mary!
How are you?
Good.
I'm glad we saw you.
Uhh!
Oh, come on, like you mean it.
Tucker, this is my friend, Pat Healy.
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Same here.
Pat is an architect as well.
Oh, really?
Where are your offices?
Mainly, I work out of Boston.
Boston, huh?
Did you get your degree up there?
You bet.
Really? Where did you study?
Harvard.
Then you must've studied under Kim Green.
Well, among others.
Huh.
You know, Pat, um
does projects all over the world.
Really? Where would I
have seen your work?
Well, have you been to, uh
well, let me see.
Santiago, Chile?
Twice last year.
Which building's yours?
Are you familiar
with the soccer stadium?
Did you build
the Estadio Olimpico?
No, just down the street
the Celinto Catayente Towers.
It's quite a fine example, in fact.
I recommend that next time
you're up that way
that you drop in and take
a ganders at it yourself.
Hey, thanks for picking me up, man.
Yeah, no problem.
I've been driving for, like,
so I could use the company.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I've been standing in the same spot
for five and a half hours.
You know they made it illegal
to hitchhike in this state?
Really?
That must make it really tough.
So, uh, what's going on with you?
You a salesman, or...
Uh, no, no,
I'm... I'm... I'm nothing.
I am.
- Yeah?
- I'm a salesman.
I'm going to start my own company.
Really?
You want in?
Uh...
I... nah.
I'm not... I don't really
have any money or...
You heard of this thing
the 8-minute abs?
Yeah, sure, 8-minute abs.
Yeah, the exercise video.
This is going to blow that right out
of the water. Listen to this.
Right.
Yes. OK, all right,
I see where you're going.
You walk into a video store. There's
Which one are you going to pick?
I'm... I would go for the seven.
Bingo, man, bingo.
And we guarantee just as good a workout
as the 8-minute folk.
You guarantee it? That's...
How do you do that?
If you're not happy
with the first seven minutes,
we're going to send you
the extra minute free.
You see? That's it. That's our motto.
That's where we're coming from.
That's from A to B.
That's right.
That's... that's good. That's good.
Unless, of course,
somebody comes up with 6-minute abs.
Then you're in trouble, huh?
No!
No, no, not six.
I said seven.
Nobody's coming up with six.
Who works out in six minutes?
You won't even get your heart going,
not even a mouse on a wheel.
That... good point.
Seven's the key number here.
Think about it.
- 7-Elevens.
- Yeah.
Seven dwarves.
Seven, man, that's the number.
Seven chipmunks twirling on a branch,
eating lots of sunflowers
on my uncle's ranch.
You know that old children's
tale from the sea.
It's like you're dreaming
about Gorgonzola cheese
when it's clearly Brie time, baby.
Step into my office.
Why?
'Cause you're fucking fired.
Yeah. I got to pee.
I'm just going to pull over.
Your car seats are making me itchy, man.
What are these made out of? Cactus?
I'm only waiting seven minutes total.
Ohh!
Hey, wait your turn.
Hey, I didn't...
Whoa.
Freeze!
Wait a minute.
This is a raid!
No. No, no, no, I was peeing.
That's what I was doing.
I was just peeing.
I was peeing, too!
Yeah, I'm sure you were all just pissing.
Let's go. Let's move it out.
Let's go.
Come on.
Shit! Jimmy Shay, is that you?
Oh, my God.
Ted?
See, hon? I told you he was gay.
A veces pienso que aquí
Todo es seguridad
Por la seca castidad
Lo de antes fue algo
Ahora es mejor
Oh, yeah, ahora es mejor...
- Your grandmother is really something.
- Magda? No, Magda's not my grandmother.
She rents the apartment next door.
Her husband died a couple years ago,
and I don't think she likes being alone.
So, you know, she just hangs out.
- Doesn't cramp your style?
- Sadly, no.
Sometimes I wish I could be like Magda
and not go home.
I'd like to bounce around for a while
and do some traveling.
I don't know why anybody
would want to bounce around,
you know, if they have
their own condo in Nepal.
I'd be there in a second.
I'd sell it.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Start fresh in a new place,
give up the architect game.
Slow things down a bit,
read more books, see more movies.
Are you a movie buff?
I try to be, but it's tough going out there
with all the crap they make today.
I just wish they made movies
like they used to make.
You know, classics
like
or
is my all-time favorite movie.
Don't bust my chops.
I know it's corny, but...
Pat, I'm not kidding.
I think that
is one of the greatest
love stories of our time.
Here I thought I was the only one.
You're too good to be true.
