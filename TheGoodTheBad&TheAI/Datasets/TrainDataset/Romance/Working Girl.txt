Let the river run
Let all the dreamers wake the nation
Come the New Jerusalem
Silver cities rise
The morning lights
The streets
that lead them
And sirens
Call them on
With a song
It's asking
for the taking
Trembling, shaking
Oh, my heart is aching
We're coming to the edge
Running on the water
Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters
We, the great and small
Stand on a star
And blaze a trail
of desire...
...Tess,
happy birthday to you
Did you make a wish?
Yeah.
Come run with me now
The sky is the color
of blue
You've never even seen
in the eyes of your lover
Oh, my heart is aching
We're coming to the edge
Running on the water
Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters
Let the river run
Let all the dreamers
wake...
No lunch.
I got speech class.
What do you need
speech class for?
You talk fine.
I'll pick you up at 5:00.
We'll ride back together.
I can't. I've got emerging market
seminar at 5:30.
It's your birthday.
Can't they emerge without you
just this once?
What time is
my surprise party?
What?
Come on.
I'm supposed to
have you home at 7:00.
I'll cut out early
and be home at 7:15.
All right.
Thank you very much.
Let the river run
Let all the dreamers
wake the nation
Come the New...
Hi, Tess.
Morning.
Jerusalem
Morning, Tess.
Morning.
Hello, Tess.
Hi.
I've got
a little secret
I want to tell you.
Mr. Turkel's line.
Um... Who's calling, please?
Um... Hold on a moment.
Mr. Lutz.
Um... Hold on
a second, all right?
I wouldn't
do that to you,
so relax and tell me
how many you want.
Mr. Turkel?
Mr. Turkel!
Huh?
Um... Mr. Alagesh...
Hi.
Mr. Alagesh is real
anxious to talk to you.
Couldn't you
get him to hold?
You got him
in Denatech,
the one I said
go short on,
and it's fine, but he don't want
to hear it from a secretary.
- There's no paper.
- What?
There is no goddamn paper.
Get me some.
Thanks.
You're very kind.
Oh!
He's short
on Denatech at 18,
and he'll be
right here.
You see
Denatech closing?
I bet it's 16.
How you figure?
They went public at 23
with one product...
plaque-removing
mouthwash.
You get this glob
of plaque
you got to spit out.
No one ever got rich
overestimating what
people want to taste.
Maybe.
Before I run, Tess,
I have good news
and bad news.
The straight shot,
Tessie, is,
they turned you down
for the entree program again.
Why?
Did all we could,
Tessie.
You're up against
Harvard graduates.
What do you got?
Some night school,
some secretarial time
on your sheet?
Christians
and lions, Tess.
The good news?
Dave has a friend.
Bob in Arbitrage.
They're looking for
hungry down there.
Really?
Hungry's the name of
the game down there.
Bob's looking for a new assistant.
He wants to meet you for a drink.
This isn't
another setup?
Sh...
Do I look
like a pimp?
Bob says he's looking
for hungry,
I think to
myself, "Tess."
The rest
is up to you.
Bob in Arbitrage.
Bob Speck.
Extension 256.
Expecting your call.
Go get him, Tessie.
Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you
- You should have told us!
Happy birthday, dear Tess
Happy birthday to you
Thanks.
Mick?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Na na na na
Da-a-um
Mmm
Surprise!
Hey!
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday.
What is this?
You look great.
Come here.
You know, Mick,
just once I could go
for a sweater
or some earrings...
a present
I could wear
outside of
this apartment.
So...
is this where you
usually meet for drinks?
Mmm. This is a big week.
It's a super week.
We are celebrating!
So, Arbitrage...
Talk about
adrenaline, huh?
What do you think is
the most important quality...
for a great arbitrager?
We'll go through all that
at the hotel.
- The hotel?
- Yeah.
The company's suite
at the Ritz Carlton.
When it's empty,
we boys get it on a bonus basis.
Woo! We're going to party!
Oh, allow me.
I'm so sorry.
Hey! Bob, please!
I'm sorry.
I get carried away.
Mmm...
Arbitrage has this
"introduction-to" tape
for the business schools.
Why don't we put it in,
and if you have questions...
That would be great.
Thanks.
It's the wrong tape,
unless you...
Bob, you're not
seriously looking
for a new assistant,
are you?
Well, not exactly
at this moment.
But I'm always looking
for new blood.
I am hungry, Bob,
but not that hungry.
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- I would.
Would you
pull over, please?
What are you doing?
No.
Ha ha ha!
Party, Bob.
Ah!
Hello, Tess.
You're late, Tess.
Yo, David!
Bitch!
You got to see this
to believe it.
Hey, take it easy!
Tess, Tess, Tess...
I know.
You don't get ahead
by calling your boss
a pimp.
Well, he is.
This is the third time
in six months
I had to place you.
It wasn't my fault.
Where have I
heard that before?
Ruth, I'm 30 years old.
Took me five years
of night school,
but I got my degree
with honors.
I know I could
do a job.
You ask any
of my bosses, even Lutz,
- if Tess McGill hasn't called a few.
- You ask 'em.
They won't sing
your praises, Tess.
Here's something
for you...
Transferring down
from Boston,
Mergers
and Acquisitions.
Name is Parker.
Starts Monday.
You go home
and cool off.
O.K.
Tess, this is
the last time
I can help you.
Four strikes,
you're out.
Hi. Tess McGill
of Katharine Parker's office.
It's the desk
at the end of the aisle.
Look at this.
I'm telling you...
Hi.
I can't believe it.
Shh! Shh! Shh!
Hi. I'm Katharine Parker.
You must be Tess.
Hi.
Oh, great bunny!
I don't usually have
a bunny on my desk.
It was my birthday
a few days ago.
Mine's next Tuesday.
How old?
Really? I'll be 30
next Tuesday.
We're
practically twins.
Except
that I'm older.
Just barely.
I've never
worked for somebody
who was younger
than me before,
or for a woman.
There's a first time
for everything.
That's not gonna be
a problem, is it, Tess?
No... no.
Pour us a couple of coffees
and come inside.
I'm light, no sugar.
The stock is 38.
The tender's at 56.
-
- Come in.
What do we do
about that?
I just checked my three.
What are yours?
Uh-huh. Yeah,
I have that one.
Well, I think he's
in an underwater position.
That's our first
and second call.
Then we'll see
where we are.
I'll count
the minutes. Bye.
Thanks.
So, Tess,
a few ground rules.
The way I look at it, you are
my link with the outside world.
People's impression of me
starts with you.
You're tough
when it's warranted,
accommodating when you can be,
accurate, punctual,
and never make a promise
you can't keep.
I'm never
on another line.
I'm in a meeting.
I consider us a team.
As such,
we have a uniform...
simple, elegant,
impeccable.
"Dress shabbily,
they notice the dress.
dress impeccably, they notice
the woman." Coco Chanel.
Um... How do I look?
You look terrific.
You might want to
rethink the jewelry.
I want your input.
I welcome ideas.
I like to see
hard work rewarded.
It's a two-way street on my team.
Am I making myself clear?
Yes, Katharine.
And call me Katharine.
O.K.
So, let's get
to work, shall we?
This department's profile
last year was damn pitiful.
Our team has got
its work cut out for it.
O.K., thanks.
Damn! I forgot
my pills again!
Did you hear about
that shot they got
in Europe?
They give it to
the women in their arm,
and it's good
for five years.
The damn pills,
I'm always forgetting them.
- I thought you might like this.
- Oh, thank you.
Tess, would you come in
and bring a notebook?
They've sold off the paper
and printing divisions.
They sell distribution too,
we're talking scorched earth.
Come on in.
Tess, this is Ginny.
Ginny, Tess.
I'm throwing
a cocktail thing
to introduce myself
to the department.
Ginny has
some great ideas.
Will you
jot them down?
- Sure.
- The caterer is Acme Eats.
You can get the number
from information.
They do the usual
hors d'oeuvres and such.
The Raging Bull
has a bartender service.
The liquor store on Broadway
and Liberty delivers.
Got that, Bess?
Tess. Yeah, if that's the way
you want to go.
You have another idea?
I was reading in W
about dim sum,
little Chinese
dumplings.
A restaurant
on Mott Street
does them for
cocktail parties.
I just love
those little dumplings.
It might be more fun
than the usual tidbits.
I have it on my desk.
I could get it.
- You read W?
- I read a lot of things.
You never know where big ideas
could come from.
Well, I guess
you're right,
if dumplings can be considered
a big idea.
That ought to
get you started.
Ginny, thank you
so much.
- Back to the gold mines.
- Right.
You'll set those up?
Right away.
Dim sum, Tess.
I like it,
contribution-wise.
Keep it up.
The chief says,
"We will respect your wish.
"We will give you
an honorable death.
But first, Kiki."
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Dim sum?
Uh, yes, yes, yes.
Now, listen.
You work with him.
Thank you.
Keep with him.
So come on, Katharine,
what do you say?
Jim, the man who spends
every weekend in August
glued to his desk
knows I can't sneak out
of my own party.
I'll tell you what,
though.
Get me in on the Southeast Air
divestiture plan,
I'll buy you a drink...
a bottle of Crystal,
two straws.
Deal?
Okey-dokey.
Dim sum?
Hi.
Thank you.
What a slob.
You were
so smooth with him.
- I probably would have...
- Never burn bridges.
Today's junior prick,
tomorrow's senior partner.
So how do you think
the party's going?
Pretty well,
I think.
Should I stop
serving now?
Better make
one more round.
I'd love to help you,
but you can't busy the quarterback
with passing out
the Gatorade.
Arnie, my hero,
you've come.
Yeah?
Um, I have an idea, and you said
I could come to you.
Shoot.
Well, you know
how Trask Industries
has been looking to
buy into broadcasting?
Something about
the department is...
Working on it. Yeah.
I've been
following it myself,
and I suddenly
thought, "Radio."
Trask is looking
for television stations.
Well, so is every Tom,
Dick and Harry.
My idea is that they
get their feet wet in radio
and build
from there.
It's not as glamorous
as jumping into TV,
but it's a solid start,
and there's more of them for sale.
It would solve
Trask's problem
with Japanese competitors
trying to take him over.
FCC forbids
foreign ownership
of radio
as well as TV.
Interesting.
You've been, um...
following this, you say?
Yeah.
No chance
you overheard it,
say, um...
on the elevator?
No. No way.
Somewhere?
It's my idea.
Good. Good.
Discuss it
with anyone else?
Nope. You think that
there's something
there?
I'll think it through
for you.
Leave me your notes.
I'll have a look-see.
O.K.
Uh... I've been trying
to get into the entree program.
This would be
a big push.
If anything happens...
Absolutely, Tess.
Two-way street, remember?
Yeah. Thank you.
It's just...
It's so exciting.
I mean, she takes
me seriously.
I think it's because...
I know you hate
when I say this,
but I think it's because
she's a woman.
There's none of that
chasing-around-the-desk crap.
It's like she wants to be my mentor,
which is what I needed.
I feel like I'm finally
getting somewhere, Mick.
Tess, that's great,
but let's step on it...
or the pizza's
gonna freeze, honey.
Maybe we could all
go out sometime...
you know,
dinner in the city.
You would like her,
I think.
God, remember when all you had
to do was a few buckles?
Yep. Those
were the days.
I called the inn.
All they can give you is a
ground-floor single in the new wing.
Did you tell them
it was me?
Well... I said Parker.
Helmut, hier ist
Katharine Parker.
Ciao.
It's this tower room
with a canopy bed
and a fireplace
big enough to stand in.
Perfect.
Everything's in place.
For what?
The man I've been
seeing for a while.
I think he's it,
and this could be
the weekend we decide.
He said there was
something very important
he wanted to discuss
with me.
- I think he's gonna pop the question.
- You do?
I think so.
We're in the same city.
I've indicated
that I'm receptive to an offer,
I've cleared June,
and I am,
after all, me.
Well, what if he doesn't
pop the question?
I really don't think
that's a variable.
Tess, you know,
you don't get anywhere
in this world
by waiting for what you want
to come to you.
You make it happen.
Watch me, Tess.
Learn from me.
Oh, I ran your
Trask radio idea
by some
of our people.
It seems Trask
is dead set on television.
It wasn't out
in left field.
I really
like the idea.
Keep plugging.
Bring me your ideas.
We'll see
what we can do.
Thank you, Katharine.
Tess.
Tess, look at me.
Who makes it happen?
I do.
Who does?
I do.
I make it happen.
That's right. Only then
do we get what we deserve.
Aah...
Miss Parker's office.
Hi, Katharine.
You what?
Broke it skiing.
They can't move me
for weeks.
This is what I need
you to do.
Water plants, O.K.
Cable comes on Friday,
right.
Hey, easy with the leg.
Quit staring up my gown.
I'm staying
at my parents' house,
and the housekeeper
is in Barbados for a month.
Wouldn't you know it?
What a mess.
You need to let in
the flower man
and the cleaning lady.
The entrance code
for the front door is...
It's 7-5-4-3-2000.
I know there's more,
but I can't think of what.
Go through
my desk calendar.
There's a bunch of invitations
to be RSVP'd.
I know I'm asking
an awful lot, Tess.
I don't know
what else to do.
I need you to take over.
O.K. Bye.
Mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Na na na na
Da-a-um
Mmm
Ah ah ah ah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Regarding those horrid
little knickknacks from the Alberts...
Dear Eleanor and Gary,
Thank you for the beautiful
salt and pepper shakers.
Not only are they the perfect
housewarming gift,
but it was dear of you
to think of me
so far away.
Dear Sister,
It's been eight years
since we said good-bye
to Wellesley.
Of course, we never really
say good-bye.
On behalf of...
the Alumni Giving Fund...
Dear Sister...
It's been
eight years...
since we said
good-bye to Wellesley.
of course,
we never really...

On behalf of the Alumni
Giving Fund,
I am writing
to you to ask...
To ask...
To ask... To ask.
To ask...
I am writing
to you to ask...
Dear Momo and Ba...
Momo and Ba.
...the New York
real estate market,
looking for
a place of my own.
Of course, it makes me
miss you all terribly,
but it will be
so lovely to see you
when you return
from Barbados.
Till then, have fun.
Much love to you and to Claudette.
Love, Kiki.
To Jack Trainer,
Dewey, Stone & Company,
from me,
RE Trask Industries

Um, hard copy on this
from the home computer.
Do not go through Tess.
To Jack Trainer,
Dewey, Stone & Company,
from me,
RE Trask Industries
radio network acquisition.
Um, hard copy on this
from the home computer.
Do not go through Tess.
Two-way street...
And you make it happen.
What, no class?
No class.
Tess, this is not
what it looks like.
I mean it is,
but I can explain.
Well, not
exactly explain...
You snake.
Shit.
Come on, Tess!
I'm sorry! I really am!
I love you!
Come on!
Come back
and hit me!
Please!
Hello. Mr. Trainer's office, please.
Hello. Tess McGill calling
from Petty-Marsh.
May I put her through?
Thank you.
Mr. Trainer?
Hi. This is Tess McGill.
I work
with Katharine Parker
over here in Mergers
and Acquisitions.
I have a proposal
that I'd like
to discuss with you.
Not over the phone, though.
Um, I have an opening
tomorrow morning at 10:00.
O.K.
I'll messenger an outline
over to you right now.
Bye.
Whew.
Yes, I'm calling
for Katharine Parker
in regard
to your invitation.
Miss Parker
is out of town,
but Miss Tess McGill
will be attending in her place.
Thank you. Bye.
Why does it do that?
For cleaning.
Are you kidding me?
No.
What is this thing
you're going to, anyway?
A closing party for
the Minadine-Dalton merger.
Dewey-Stone's
throwing it,
which is where
Jack Trainer works.
Mix business
with pleasure.
Fringe times are crucial.
Did you snatch
her invite?
Well, she can't use it.
It's important for me
to interact with people
not as a secretary.
But as
a total impostor.
Right.
This is it.
It needs some bows
or something.
No.
It's simple, elegant,
yet makes a statement.
Says to people,
confident, a risk-taker,
not afraid
to be noticed.
Then you hit them
with your smarts.
Here. Shoes.
I need shoes.
$6,000?
It's not
even leather!
$6,000?
$6,000?
Cyn...
I can't breathe
so good.
Oh, God, come here.
Sit down.
Let's see if she's got
anything soothing.
Valium.
In the convenient
economy size.
You sure?
It just chills you ever so slightly.
You won't even notice it.
Ohh.
Are you sure
about this?
You want to be
taken seriously,
you need serious hair.
Hmm.
I've been telling you
this for three weeks.
We got 25%.
We get another 5%,
we've got them
by the throat.
Listen, Trainer,
let's grab them by the balls.
- Leave our hearts at home.
- Cut them off at the knees.
They'll be eating out of our hands.
What do you say?
Anybody thirsty?
We need
this one, Trainer.
You need this one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I've been
looking for you.
Why? Do you know me?
No, but I promised myself
that when I saw you,
I would
get to know you.
You're the first woman I've seen
at one of these things
that dresses
like a woman,
not like a woman thinks
a man would if he was a woman.
Thank you, I guess.
What are you
doing here?
I'm looking
for someone myself.
His name
is Jack Trainer.
He works
at Dewey-Stone.
Do you know
if he's here?
Why are you
looking for him?
I have a meeting
with him tomorrow,
and I thought I might
say hello
and get a head start.
Well, he, uh...
just left.
Oh.
Well, I should
be going myself.
Well, have a drink
with me.
I can't.
What's your name?
No. No names,
no business cards,
no "You must know
so and so."
- What is this?
- No resumes.
Let's just meet
like human beings,
for once.
It's nice to meet you,
whatever your name is,
but I really do
have to go.
Please?
Please... one drink.
O.K., one drink,
but I'm buying.
O.K., but it's
an open bar.
Right. I knew that.
I meant that
if it wasn't,
- I would be buying.
- Yeah.
Tequila gold.
Doubles.
Tequila.
I promised myself
that when we met,
we'd drink tequila.
No Chardonnay,
no frog water.
Real drinks.
Ha ha.
Oh.
Yeah.
These things
are usually...
so boring.
Ha ha ha!
I wouldn't know.
Power to the people.
The little people.
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
Ha ha! You O.K?
I'm fine.
I'm just fine.
I took a...
um, antihistamine
before,
and it just...
makes for
a nice little buzz.
Oh?
I didn't know
they let bad girls
into these things.
Do I look like
I don't belong here?
No, no, I'm sure
you're a real ace
at whatever it is
that you do do.
Damn straight.
But how you look...
I have a head
for business
and a bod for sin.
Is there anything
wrong with that?
No. No.
Hello! Hi!
And I have to
go now.
Well, I'll come
with you.
No.
Hey, Tess!
Uh...
Uh...
Tess!
I need some air.
Meet me outside.
Thank you.
Excuse me, please.
Hello?
Hi.
Hi.
Hello.
Oh.
Where do you live?
Hmm?
Where do you live?
Mmm...
park...
trees...
tall building.
It might be
kind of a mess.
The cleaning lady
keeps changing...
days on me.
Anybody's guess.
I'm just warning
you 'cause...
if it's
the day before,
it could be
pretty bad.
I don't notice
so much myself,
but some of the people
I've had over have,
you know,
remarked on it.
It's not so bad.
Would you...
Would you like
a nightcap?
I guess not.
Uh...
I guess it's
too late for coffee.
Hmm.
Herb tea?
Herb te-- No.
I don't have any.
It always
sounds good
when people
offer it to me
when I'm
in your shape.
I might have
a little brandy, myself.
Boy.
You sure are pretty.
Don't fuck up.
Don't fuck up.
Don't fuck up.
Hi. Tess McGill
to see Jack Trainer.
May I take your coat?
Yes, please.
Thank you.
Ahem.
Gentlemen, Tess McGill.
O.K.
Miss McGill,
I'm Jack Trainer.
How are you?
This is John Romano
and Bernie Kotarka.
Sit down, please.
Ahem.
Coffee?
Sure.
Milk or sugar?
Um, yes, both.
Thank you.
Ahem.
Well, I suppose
we should just
get right down to it.
Is that O.K?
Sure. Please.
Ahem...
I lost my briefcase.
In each of the last
three quarters,
Trask Industries
has announced plans
to acquire a major market
television station,
each time
unsuccessfully.
They've expended
time and money
fighting off
a hostile takeover
by one of their
Japanese competitors.
Ahem.
Buying into radio
would,
in one fell swoop,
accomplish
two important tasks.
It would give Trask
a solid base in broadcasting,
and because of
FCC regulations
forbidding foreign
ownership of radio stations,
it would wipe out
the threat of a Japanese takeover.
Interesting idea.
But I don't like it.
Trask has got a lot
of cash on their balance sheet.
It's one of the big reasons
they're a takeover target.
A radio station
is small potatoes.
I can't
see them biting.
Well, I've already
thought of that.
I figure that we look
for a radio network,
one with
a real high profile,
then with
the surplus cash,
we implement a major
stock repurchase.
So Trask is protected,
and their stock goes up,
and everybody's happy.
Or not.
Oh, shoot me,
just shoot me.
Cut that out.
They didn't throw you out, did they?
Oh, well, they don't exactly
have bouncers, you know?
They're a little more
subtle than that, Cyn.
Oh, God, and last night!
Yeah, I should have
checked the milligrams.
Live and learn.
Maybe he'll feel
sorry for you
and make it up
by doing your deal.
I'm not looking
for sympathy, you know?
I had a shot
at it, you know?
Miss Tess McGill.
It's him. He's here.
Do me a favor.
Be me...
Be my secretary.
Tess...
Cyn, please.
Do it for me, O.K?
Tess!
- Hi.
- May I help you?
Jack Trainer
to see Miss McGill.
Let's give her
a shout, shall we?
You decent?
A Mr. Jack Trainer
to see you, Miss McGill.
Thank you, Cynthia.
Hold all calls?
Yes, thank you.
Can I get you anything?
Coffee, tea, me?
Ha ha ha!
Isn't she a riot?
That'll be all,
Cynthia.
Why did you say
you weren't you
last night?
Because I knew
what would happen.
All Mergers
and Acquisitions...
no lust and tequila.
That was...
I mean, that
just happened, O.K?
I want to
make it clear, um...
Yes?
What did happen,
exactly?
The earth moved.
The angels wept.
The Polaroids are,
uh, uh...
are in my other coat.
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.
I woke up
in my underwear.
I'll bet
you looked nice.
Did you
get me that way?
I, uh...
I took off your shoes.
I took off your dress.
I put you on the bed.
I kept my eyes closed
the whole time.
And that was it?
I might have peeked.
I don't remember.
I don't have all day
to hang out here
and discuss
your sex life. Here.
What's this?
Open it.
Ahem.
What's this for?
You could use
a better briefcase
if we're going to
put this deal together.
You liked it.
It has possibilities.
I want to go first
to Metro Radio Systems.
They're a solid,
family-owned,
midsized network
in the South.
Had offers before
and rejected them.
Father's retiring,
the son's been forced out.
A lot of squabbling,
good time to go in.
O.K.
There's one thing
we don't get...
Why did you
come to us?
Will you excuse me
for one second?
Sure.
You cannot help me! No!
Bess, I need Katharine's office
right away.
I'll be with you
in five minutes.
I need it
five minutes ago.
I'll be
right with you.
What's going on?
She's dusting?
Jack, my 1:00 is
getting a little antsy,
so can I walk you
to the elevator?
Yeah, sure, but first
answer my question.
Right. Uh...
I came to you because...
I wanted
an ace on this.
The best.
Mm-hmm.
Good thinking.
I'll fly down to Memphis
in the morning
and feel them out.
Absolutely.
Fine.
Everyone wants a part
of the McGill mind.
You'll just
have to wait.
Ginny, go right in.
I'll be right with you.
She's backed up.
What are you
talking about?
Can I get you anything?
Coffee, tea?
You free
for dinner tonight?
No. Sorry.
O.K.
How about tomorrow?
I'll be back around 8:00.
I can't.
When, then?
I don't think
that we should
get involved
that way.
What about last night?
Look, I'm not
that girl.
- Last night was... special.
- It wasn't so special...
I had to carry you up
three flights of stairs.
I meant "unusual"
special.
Look, we're in a business deal
together now.
I just don't think
we should get
involved that way.
My life is
real complicated.
I don't want to complicate it.
I just thought dinner, a movie.
We both know what
we're talking about.
I certainly hope so.
You know...
maybe I just
don't like you.
Me?
Nah.
Ha ha ha!
Tonight's the night
we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put
all other things aside
Give in this time
and show me some affection
We're going for
those pleasures in the night
You sure
she's going to show?
It's my
engagement party.
She knows she's dead meat
if she doesn't.
...Please you,
I just can't get enough
Hi, Tess.
...Move real slow,
I'll let it go
Let's get excited
I'm sorry.
I got stuck at work.
You'll be out of work,
you keep scamming like you are.
I am nervous as hell.
Mick's about to drown himself
in the scotch.
He's bad, huh?
Throw him a bone,
will you?
I want happy humans
here tonight.
I want you, I want you
Ooh, boy,
I want to love you
Tess.
Snake.
I want to squeeze you,
please you...
You look different.
Well,
I'm not the same
pathetic, trusting
fool I was.
It shows, huh?
What are
you having?
Stow this behind
the bar for me.
I'll have a Chivas,
and buy Mick
one of whatever.
You got it.
Ahem.
I just meant
the hair
and the duds
and the briefcase.
What's going on?
Make fun
if you want.
No, No.
You look good.
Classy.
What, did you
have to go
to traffic court
or something?
No, I just
got off work.
I sort of got
a promotion.
Well...
to Cyn and Tim...
to you and me...
to you and your promotion...
to me getting
a boat loan.
You what? You did?
My loan was approved
just this morning.
Put a down payment
on Jimmy Noonan's old boat.
That's so great.
Never seen you
looking so lovely
As you did tonight
I've never seen you
shine so bright
Hmm hmm hmm mmm
Never seen so many men
Ask you if
you wanted to dance
Looking for
a little romance
Given half a chance
I have never seen
that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights
in your hair
That catch your eye
I have been blind
Lady in red
Woo!
"Hours of fun
for the entire family.
Love, Tess and Mick."
Thank you.
I put from both of us.
I didn't know if
you'd gotten something.
O.K., toast.
We need a toast!
Thank you,
thank you.
From me and Tess,
and everybody here,
may your life together
be long and happy,
and may the road always
rise up to meet you.
Hear, hear!
When will we toast
the two of you?
Yeah!
Ha ha ha!
Well, we haven't
really discussed it.
I mean,
not recently.
You don't discuss it,
you just ask.
That's right.
Here?
Yeah!
Now?
Yeah!
On your knees, man.
Mick! Mick!
Mick! Mick! Mick!
Mick! Mick! Mick!
Mick! Mick! Mick!
Mick! Mick! Mick!
Yeah!
Ya-hah!
Yeah! Woo!
Here!
Tess, will you marry me?
Maybe.
Ooh!
That's an answer?
You want another answer,
ask another girl.
Whoa!
Sssss!
Ha ha!
You fuckin'
humiliated us in there.
You set us up. What did you expect me
to do, lie in front of those people...
- and automatically say yes?
- Didn't know you'd have to lie.
I thought you would
want me to ask.
Three nights ago,
I find you in bed with Doreen.
We have a drink and a dance,
then you want an answer
- about the rest of my life.
- All right. O.K.
Here we are.
Will you marry me or what?
Jesus, Mick.
Do we have to decide now?
I want to get things
solidified in my life.
You're not the only one
who's got plans.
I said maybe.
Maybe means dick!
Fuck maybe! I want an answer!
Please don't yell.
You treat me like...
Why do we always end up talking
about the way you get treated?
Who the fuck died
and made you Grace Kelly?
I am not steak.
You can't
just order me.
I don't need this.
You get your priorities straight,
maybe we'll talk.
Right now,
we're history.
Katharine Parker's office.
Um... I'll
switch you over.
Tess, it's me.
I couldn't find
the right shoes.
Shh!
Tess McGill's office.
Who's calling?
One moment, please.
Ahem...
Jack.
Went well
in Memphis. Yeah.
Really well,
I think.
We'll have to move fast
and hit them high.
Armbrister thinks
of Metro as family.
You know how that can be.
He's willing to listen.
We got to get Trask
to talk sweet.
He's thinking
about 70 mill.
I've been up here all night,
working the numbers.
I'd like to go
over it with you.
Can we meet for lunch?
Lunch is all right, isn't it?
Daylight, lot of people around.
There's a real romantic
souvlaki stand
in front
of your place.
You're in no particular
danger, I think.
Yeah. Meet you there
around 1:00.
O.K., I'll see you
then. Bye.
Mick's really raw.
He says
he's going to throw
the rest
of your stuff out.
He kept talking at me
till 5:00 this morning.
Oh, God, Cyn,
I'm sorry.
How hard would it be
to crash a wedding?
What are you
talking about?
Oren Trask's daughter
is getting married tomorrow.
There's a reception following,
so I figured I blend in,
I get to Trask.
I mean, how hard
could that be?
The wedding party's
not going to admit
they've never
seen you before.
Nobody knows everybody
at those things, right?
- Tess, wait a minute...
- All I need is five minutes.
Tess, I'm
talking to you.
What?
First of all,
look me in the eye
and tell me you're not thinking,
even in your wildest dreams,
Mr. Briefcase-
Let's-Have-Lunch
will take you away
from all of this.
We're doing a deal
together, that's all.
You'll get
your heart stomped
just like you're
stomping Mick's.
It wasn't me popping
Doreen Dimucci in our bed.
How come you're
all on his side?
I'm not.
You're not even
giving him
the chance to make it up to you,
and that's not like you.
If you're so smart,
why don't you act smart
and save your ass
while you still can?
You're not going
to have any job.
You're out of
your man and home already.
I'm going to
come clean
as soon as I get
my end set up.
I swear.
I know what I'm doing.
So do I.
You're screwin' up your life.
No, I'm trying
to make it better.
I won't spend
the rest of my life
working my ass off
and getting nowhere
because I followed rules
I didn't set up.
Tess McGill's office.
Katharine!
Of course it's
still your office.
I don't know...
I'll see you, Tess.
Cyn.
Sometimes I dance around
the house in my underwear.
It doesn't make me
Madonna... never will.
Umm... are you there?
Yes, Katharine.
Don't get too used
to those long lunches.
They're letting me go
a week from today.
Isn't that a little faster
than you thought?
The doctor says
I've got great bones.
Of course, his aren't
too bad, either.
Ha ha ha!
Anyway, I need you
to summarize...
Hi, Shatz!
Send that along with the last
two quarterly reports.
You are a sport.
Yes, I am a sport.
Thanks. I'll talk
to you soon.
O.K. Bye.
What kind of figures
have you thrown at them?
No exact figures yet.
Well, what's
their ballpark?
I wanted to get them
excited about the concept
before I started throwing
actual figures at them.
Are they excited?
They're going to be.
Wait a minute.
I've been working
on this for 36 hours
trying to put it
together.
I got a progress meeting with
the head of my department at 2:00.
Where the hell
are we?
Don't yell at me.
Hey, answer me.
Well, as a matter
of fact,
I'm going to see
Trask himself tomorrow.
I feel we're strong enough
to go right to him.
Where are we meeting him?
What time?
He's not expecting
both of us.
Are you trying to
fly this thing without me?
No... I wouldn't
do that.
You set up this meeting without me.
What does that say?
What the hell kind of way
to do business is this?
Would you calm down?
How am I supposed
to calm down?
One lost deal is all it takes
to get canned.
My phone will have
an inch of tape...
the names
of new guys
over the names
of old guys...
good men who aren't
there anymore
because
of one lost deal.
I don't want to get
buried under tape.
No one's trying to
bury you under tape.
So I've been
in a little slump.
I'm not afraid to admit it.
There it is.
But give me a break.
Don't go leaving me out.
If you've got doubts about me, say
them to my face. Give me that much.
I don't have
any doubts about you.
O.K.
You need me,
you know.
I mean any doubts
about your abilities.
You need me
at that meeting.
Is he jet lagged,
or he just lunches late?
a late lunch.
It's not exactly lunch,
but there will be food.
What's
the story, Tess?
It's his daughter's
wedding.
That's
the meeting?
It's the perfect opportunity.
He's happy, he's had a little champagne,
we look for an opening...
trust me.
Are we supposed to
jump out of the cake?
Don't be silly.
Welcome to our party.
Come in.
Hello.
Nice to see you.
Do you know which
table you're at?
- No.
- Yes.
I do, darling.
Oh, I see Phyllis.
Come on.
Glad you could
make it.
Oren
and Barbara Trask.
Tess McGill.
What a great idea.
- Jack Trainer.
- So nice to see you again.
The kids thought
it would be fun.
- You must be friends of Mark's.
- Right.
Let's get you over there.
Actually, I really should
go powder my bathroom... nose.
- Darling, will you wait here?
- Sure.
It's so nice
to see you... later.
I think
I'll get a drink.
Bunny.
Who's he?
Wow!
He is
gorgeous.
He's
so cute.
Mm-hmm.
Get a grip.
Tess, get a grip.
Ahem...
We're not even invited
to this thing, are we?
So we're not
exactly invited,
but he's here and we're here,
so that makes us...
Total idiots.
In the right place
at the right time.
You're like one
of those crazed cops...
the kind nobody
wants to ride with
because his partners
end up dead or crazy.
Just act
like you belong.
Oh... Do you love it,
or do you hate it?
Love it.
So do I,
but Mark says
it looks like Nicaragua
and we're making
some statement.
Oh, no. It's
just like paradise.
It's like paradise
with little gold palm trees.
Ha ha ha.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I hope I'm not
being rude,
but...
who are you?
I'm Tess.
I'm a friend of Mark's.
I'm so happy I could be here
for you today.
Glorious. Fabulous.
Stunning. Really.
Super. Elegant.
Perfect.
You're right.
This is crazy,
so let's
just go.
Excuse me.
The woman dancing with Oren,
what's her name?
Oh, Elizabeth
Stowenfield.
That's right.
Uh... Liz? Beth?
Bitsy.
Bitsy. That's right.
Jack.
You want to do it,
do it.
Excuse us.
Bitsy, don't break my heart
and tell me
you don't remember me.
Of course I do.
Excuse us.
Ha ha ha!
Talk about a small world, huh?
I mean,
here we've just met,
and yet I feel
I've spent so much time
working with you.
I'm in Mergers and Acquisitions
at Petty-Marsh.
I wish we were having
more luck with your team.
So do I. So do I.
I've tried to set you up
with a radio network,
but my bosses think you're stuck
on acquiring television.
That's not true.
I said, the man
who in 1971
looked into the future
and saw that it was named
microwave technology,
the man who applied
Japanese management principles
while others were
still kowtowing to the unions,
the man who saw the Ma Bell
breakup coming...
this man did not get to be
this man... you, I mean...
by shutting himself
off to new ideas.
Am I right?
- I think you're right.
- Damn straight, I'm right.
If you've got the right property,
I'd love to hear about it.
You would?
Absolutely.
There she is.
I'm hogging the father
of the bride,
and I see Phyllis
coming in.
What do you say
that I call you on Monday?
Our consultant
is Tim Draper.
Tim. Right.
Honey, I'm starved.
So am I.
Bye.
Bye.
Ha ha ha!
Go ahead and laugh.
He wants us to meet
his people Monday.
Oren Trask...
the man who said,
what if we slice
the bread before we sold it?
- All right.
- No, no, no. I loved it. I had fun,
and you were amazing.
You think so?
Amazing.
Ha ha ha.
The Fort Worth station
projected revenues
should read
up 8% not 6,
and where it says
the FCC ruling
on Metro's Memphis
transmitter is pending,
that's outdated.
FCC approved it Friday.
Doubles
the signal reach.
Ups the station's
value by 30%.
And now, back to our regularly
scheduled programming.
I guess we're ready.
Trainer and McGill.
- Yes. Top of the stairs.
- Thank you.
Are we waiting
for Mr. Trask?
Mr. Trask doesn't
sit in at this level.
Of course
he doesn't.
Ahem... Here's
the way we see it...
Trask Industries has
two important needs at this time.
By acquiring
Metro Radio Network,
you nail two birds
with one stone.
Do you have any proposals
besides Metro?
No. Why?
Metro's a terrific
opportunity.
I'm sure it is,
but a Chicago group
just put a bear hug on Metro
this morning... the company's in play.
Just this morning?
Who?
The Slade Brothers.
Trask isn't aiming
at radio anyway.
We don't want to get
into a bidding war.
A moment, please.
Armbrister looks at Metro
as part of his family.
He cares who
he's selling to.
Yes...
and he holds
the majority
of the stock.
If the Slades
are uninvited...
and I'm sure
they are...
and Armbrister and Trask can
agree on a deal,
then we won't
have a war.
If I get Armbrister,
will Trask meet him?
Lot of "ifs."
We really don't want to get involved.
Sorry. Not interested.
Yes, sir?
All right, sir.
Yes, he'll take
the meeting.
That was
Mr. Trask?
Yes, it was.
How did he know?
He knows everything.
Hmm...
Thanks a lot.
Thanks.
How did you get
this scar?
Some guy pulled
a knife in Detroit.
Really?
No. No. I was 19.
I thought it would be cool
to have a pierced ear.
My girlfriend stuck
the needle through.
I fainted and hit
my chin on the toilet.
Ha ha ha ha!
And you've been telling
that story ever since?
You're the only one
who knows the true story.
Except the girlfriend.
I had her,
uh... disappear.
It's too bad.
Nice girl.
Real shame.
Jack, there's something
that I have to tell you.
Hello.
Hi.
Umm...
Oh, no. No.
It can't wait?
Umm...
Yeah, O.K.
Well, call me
when you get in.
O.K.
Uhh... me, too.
O.K. Bye.
Bye.
O.K... There's
this woman.
It's over...
but technically,
it's not.
I just haven't got a chance
to break it off yet.
It's O.K.
You don't have to explain.
We were supposed to go away
a couple weeks ago,
and I was going to
tell her then,
but I had to work,
and I never got there.
It's just
a... timing thing.
It's just she broke
her leg skiing,
and I couldn't see
doing it over the phone.
You know, kicking somebody
when they're down.
I wouldn't
have mentioned it,
except she's in your department
at Petty.
You mentioned her
the first time you called.
Katharine.
Parker, yeah.
Now, what did you
want to tell me, huh?
Oh, it's not important.
Oh, Miss, you
forgot your book.
Ha ha ha ha!
Tess, it's me.
I'm back.
Thanks.
Oh, God.
She took a muscle relaxant
for the flight down.
- Let's all have one, shall we?
- I don't think so.
Oh, I need
a telephone.
Oh, Tess, take care of the bags.
I'll meet you at the car.
O Tannenbaum
O Tannenbaum
Oh, I love these pills.
Just for a minute,
Jack... please.
I must see you,
darling.
My apartment
in one hour,
and I won't take no
for an answer.
No, I won't take no
for an answer.
Oh, I'm home!
I'm home! I'm home!
Oh...
Oh, God.
Did you happen
to see this?
What is it?
It's your idea for a Trask
radio acquisition.
I was planning to send it
to Jack Trainer...
give your idea
one last go-round.
But it occurs to me,
looking at it,
that it reads as though
it were my idea.
Jack got burned once...
he was accused
of stealing a plan
for taking a company private.
He's very sticky about
the ethics of reviewing
other people's
formative strategies.
He wouldn't have
looked at it
if I'd said it was
from a colleague,
and I couldn't very well
say it was a secretary's notion.
Anyway, the point is that
I'm trying to get you heard.
Oh.
What am I saying?
If you had seen it,
you simply would have
asked me about it.
Trust.
I'll need help
bathing and changing.
Oh, I need something
to cover this cast.
There's an afghan
on the chair.
Perfect.
If that
will be all...
Oh, and some perfume.
Uhh... shalimar.
on the dresser.
He loves shalimar.
He who?
Jack Trainer who.
He's on
his way over.
I have to go...
doctor's appointment.
Oh, one last thing...
Run to the drugstore
and get my pills.
I really
have to go.
The doctor
will understand.
Thanks.
Keep the change.
Who is it?
It's Jack.
Katharine?
In the bedroom.
Jack.
Katharine.
Boy, did I ever
miss you.
Ha ha ha.
Does it hurt?
Look at you.
You said
it was urgent.
I'd forgotten how damn
handsome you are.
Thanks. Look, uh...
I meant what I said.
I'm really swamped...
Some welcome home.
I haven't even gotten a kiss.
Ha ha ha!
Ahh... hmm...
There's some champagne
in the little fridge.
You want to get it
for us?
Sure, and then
I really do have to go.
Where are
the glasses?
Try the dishwasher.
There you are.
You know
I love you.
You know that.
Katharine, I really do
have to get going.
These past few weeks,
I've heard this funny sound
down deep inside.
Tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock.
My biological clock.
Big deal going.
Principals are meeting...
And I've been thinking...
let's merge...
you and I.
Think of it, darling.
Mr. and Mrs.
Fabulously Happy.
Katharine, it's really
not a good time
to talk.
You're right.
Can Big Jack
come out to play?
Little Jack really
has to get going.
Little Kate has been
so lonely.
No, no, no!
Jack!
What is it?
There's something
I have to tell you.
- There's someone else.
- Someone else?
Someone else that I have to be
meeting with
right now...
big deal going.
Can't be in two places
at the same time.
Talk to you later.
Bye.
Ha ha ha.
Here we are.
I've got to run.
Sorry. Bye.
Tess, you forgot your...
notebook.
That... little... slut!
Damn you,
bitch secretary!
Hi. I have a meeting
with Mr. Trask.
Your name, please.
Tess McGill.
- It's at the top of the stairs.
- Thank you.
- Miss... McGill.
- Yes.
Good afternoon.
Let me take
your coat.
Thank you.
This way, please.
Thank you.
Hi.
Hi.
Is everything O.K?
Yeah. Yeah.
You're the only one
from Petty here.
What's going on?
I'm flying solo
on this.
Good.
Armbrister and Trask
are in the corner.
We're waiting to see
what color smoke comes out.
Tell me something...
If a colleague
of mine had a strategy,
would you look at it
if I asked?
Yeah, sure.
No ethics problem?
You know, open to accusations
about stealing?
I look at stuff
all the time.
Nobody's ever
accused me of stealing.
What's it about?
Um... I don't know.
I'm so nervous
I can't...
stand still.
You'll be fine.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Gentlemen.
There was a story
on the news last night
showing life imitating
an old children's riddle.
It seems that a truck got stuck
at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel.
Too high
for the clearance.
For hours, the experts
tried to find some way
to unwedge the vehicle,
but to no avail.
Finally, a 10-year-old girl
in a passing car
suggested letting the air
out of the truck's tires,
thus lowering it
to the clearance level,
which they did,
and it worked.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
By letting
some of the air
out of our strategy
to expand into broadcasting,
Miss McGill
and Mr. Trainer
have effectively shown
all of us here at Trask
the light at the end
of our tunnel.
Uh, gentlemen,
and ladies,
I've decided
to sell Mr. Trask
the Metro Radio System
for $68.5 million
in cash and securities.
Now, of course, this is
an agreement in principle.
As to...
ha ha ha...
what constitutes principles
in this day and age,
I'll leave up to you barracudas
to squabble over.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
I'm certain they want to hear this!
This is a closed meeting,
and you can't...
Thank God
I'm here.
What's going on?
You're being tricked!
Katharine, what...
Jack, just trust me
and sit down.
My name
is Katharine Parker,
and I'm an associate partner in Mergers
and Acquisitions at Petty-Marsh,
and this woman
is my secretary.
She's not!
Oh, no?
Ask her.
You're not
her secretary.
I can explain, Jack.
Jesus. You are
her secretary.
While I was laid up
with broken bones,
she riffled
through my desk,
found my memo outlining
a Trask radio acquisition,
and has been passing it off
as her idea.
It was my idea.
She stole it from me, I swear.
Good God, Tess, don't you know
when to stop?
But you're lying!
Oh.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
Ahh.
Thank you all
so much.
The up side is
that I have found out
in time to control
the damage.
We have containment,
and we have a deal
on the table.
I say...
pass me a set of papers.
Let's get on with it.
Who's running
this thing?
Just... a second,
please.
I know you don't
believe me, but...
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Ahem.
Ahem.
Well... gentlemen,
the players
may have changed
but the game
remains the same,
and the name
of the game
is let's make a deal.
If you'll all turn to page 22
in your prospectus,
I'd like to take you through
the terms of transferal.
Oh, hi!
Oh,
that's so nice!
Bye.
Bye.
Aah!
Well, they did it.
Yeah,
they sure did.
You really
look... great.
How are you?
Good.
Good.
Business is great,
and, uh...
Mick,
did you see me?
I caught it
one-handed.
Oh, hi.
Hey, Doreen.
My boat's booked
through three weeks from now.
Doreen's
working the lines.
That's great.
Really.
So how's life
in the fast lane?
Well, it's, um... fast.
It's real fast
and busy and...
It's good
to see you, Mick.
I guess
I better get.
It's good
to see you, too.
Cyn told us about
what happened.
It really bites
the big one, Tess.
We took up
a little collection.
- Thanks.
- It's not much.
It's just enough
to go get toasted
some night when
you really need it.
Don't say no.
We really wanted to.
No paying Con Ed
with it.
O.K., thanks.
So what are you
going to do now, huh?
Oh, you know...
play some golf,
redecorate
the country house.
Ha ha ha!
I don't know.
Start all over.
Find a job,
a place to live,
and just wise up
and not take the whole thing
so seriously.
I'll be O.K.
Ahem.
Bye.
Bye, sweetie.
- Thank you.
- We'll miss you.
Thanks.
So long, Tess.
Bye, Tess.
Don't work too hard!
Good-bye, Tess.
Ooh!
I'm sorry.
shit.
I've been trying
to find you.
Just leave
me alone.
Just one thing...
Was you and me
just part
of the scheme, too?
No!
Look, if I had told you
I was just some secretary, you
never would have taken the meeting.
Think about it. Maybe you would
have fed me a few drinks,
then tried to get me
into the sack, end of story.
That's not true.
Are you sure
about that?
Can you honestly tell me that
it wouldn't have made a difference?
Who's fooling who
here?
What's this,
more stolen files?
No. It's my stuff
from the desk.
Your stuff?
Now, there's
a broad term.
No. It's my stuff.
Maybe you can fool these guys
with this saint act,
but do not ever speak to me
like we don't know what happened.
Tess,
this is business.
Let's just bury
the hatchet, O.K?
Know where you
can bury it?
Get your bony ass
out of my sight.
If you think I said I loved you
as part of some scheme,
that's really pathetic!
My God.
She'll stop at nothing.
What kind of show
are you people running?
I'm sorry you had to see this,
but it means nothing to us.
Jack, let's get upstairs.
- Not without her.
- Jack.
Trainer, are you trying
to blow this deal?
No, sir. I'm trying to make sure
that it gets done right.
Tess is this team's leader.
She put this deal together.
We shouldn't proceed
without her.
You shouldn't
let your johnson
make business
decisions for you.
I'm not, sir.
I'm telling you,
she's your man.
What brings you
to that conclusion?
She said so,
and I believe her.
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Are you with us or not?
No.
Jack, I forgive you.
Now get
on this elevator.
Sorry, Katharine.
You will be sorry,
Jack.
Ask her to tell you
about the hole in your deal.
What hole?
She's playing games.
Fine. Go.
- No. What hole?
- Look.
The people page?
Now this
is ridiculous.
"Former Miss America Dawn Bixby
has been house hunting here.
"Seems Dawn and hot, hot,
hot DJ-hubby Slim Slicker
are getting ready to take
a bite out of the Big Apple."
So?
Slim Slicker's
one of Metro's major assets.
Syndicated
to all their stations.
The cornerstone
of their programming.
You lose him and Metro's just
O.K. real estate with falling ratings,
and you're not buying it
for a write-off.
Better make sure he's locked in
before they sign anything.
Oren,
I have this covered.
Upstairs, shall we?
Oren!
Hear the lady out,
sir.
There's
another elevator.
You're on.
O.K.
See, this is Forbes.
It's just
your basic article
about how you were looking
to expand into broadcasting.
The same day...
I'll never forget this...
I'm reading page 6
of the Post.
There's this item
on Bobby Stein,
the radio talk show guy
who does all those gross jokes
about Ethiopia
and the Betty Ford Center.
He's hosting
this charity auction...
real blue bloods.
Now I turn the page to Susie,
who does the society stuff,
and there's this picture
of your daughter.
She's helping to organize
the charity ball,
so I started to think,
"Trask. Radio.
Trask, radio."
Then I hooked up
with Jack,
and he came on board
with Metro,
and, and...
so now, here we are.
Oren, we don't have
any more time for fairy tales.
Miss Parker,
let me ask you a question.
How did you
come up with the idea
for Trask
to buy out Metro?
How did I, uh...
Well, let's see.
The, um...
The impulse.
What led you
to put the two together?
I would have
to check my files.
I can't recall
exactly the, um...
It's not as if
it was in the mainstream.
You know, it would have
to be the, um...
Jack,
help me out here.
Oren,
I beg your pardon,
but if... if you
are insinuating...
If I were you,
I'd go to your office
and take a long, last look around.
Because in five minutes,
I'm going to
see to it
that you get the boot,
but good.
Oren, this is a simple
misunderstanding.
You cannot...
I can, and I will!
Now get your...
What did you
call it?
- Bony ass.
- Bony ass.
Right.
Bony ass
out of my sight.
I'm sorry,
but I simply
won't stand
for that kind
of talk.
Will you
excuse me, please?
Why didn't you tell us this
in the board room?
No one was going to listen,
sir, not to me.
You can bend the rules
once you get upstairs,
but not while you're
trying to get there.
And if you're like me, you can't
get there without bending the rules.
You've got fire
in your belly.
Or was this a one-time stunt
that you pulled?
I'm not sure what you mean.
I have something in my belly,
but I think it's nervous knots.
Are you willing to go
out on that limb every day,
working for me,
legitimately?
Yes, sir.
Have to be right
at the entry level.
Have any problem
with that?
No, sir.
Gumption, Miss McGill.
Yes, sir.
See you tomorrow.
O.K.
Trainer. Dwayne.
Let's go back
to my office
and see about this
Slim what's his name's contract.
Be right
with you, sir.
- Aww.
- Aww.
Way to go, Tess.
Way to go.
Beauty!
For you.
You like it?
Ha ha ha!
Peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.
Milk money.
Twinkies.
Pen, pencil, ruler.
Apple
for the teacher.
Now, remember...
Play nice
with the other kids.
Make sure you're home
before dark.
Hi. Tess McGill.
Good morning.
Good morning.
The director's
out sick today.
She'll see you
first thing tomorrow.
Miss Baxter's
already up there.
She'll show you
the layout.
It's at the end
of the hall.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Anybody will be an improvement
over that terrorist.
I mean...
something semihuman.
Oh.
I didn't
hear you come in.
I'm Alice Baxter.
Tess McGill.
I was just...
using the phone.
Yes, well...
that happens.
How about
some coffee?
Sure,
just tell me where.
No. I'll get it.
Oh. How?
Milk and sugar, please.
Thank you.
Uh... Miss McGill?
Yes?
That's your desk...
in there.
I don't think so.
Oh, yes.
I sit out here.
I'm sorry.
I thought
the secretary
would sit out here.
That's right.
I'm the secretary.
If it's O.K.,
I prefer "assistant."
You've got a 10:00 meeting
with Slater,
from Logistics...
his office on 23...
and lunch
with Mr. Trask,
his office downtown,
It's all right there
in the computer.
Just hit shift "S"
for your schedule.
Um... When I saw you
in here on the phone
with your feet up,
I figured this
was your office.
I'm sorry about that,
Miss McGill.
It won't happen
again... ever.
It's O.K.
Maybe now would
be a good time
to go over what you
expect of me.
Uh...
Ahem.
I, uh, I expect you
to call me Tess.
I don't expect you
to fetch me coffee
unless you're getting
some for yourself,
and, um...
the rest we'll just
make up as we go along.
O.K?
O.K.
I'll be right outside
if you need anything.
Fine.
Cyn.
Guess where I am.
Ha ha!
Let the river run
Let all the dreamers
wake the nation
Come the New Jerusalem
Silver cities rise
The morning lights
The streets
that lead them
And sirens
Call them on
With a song
It's asking
for the taking
Trembling, shaking
Oh, my heart is aching
We're coming to the edge
Running on the water
Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters
We, the great and small
Stand on a star
And blaze a trail
of desire
Through the darkening dawn
It's asking
for the taking
Come run with me now
The sky is the color
of blue
You've never even seen
in the eyes of your lover
Oh, my heart is aching
We're coming
to the edge
Running on the water
Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters
It's asking
for the taking
Trembling, shaking
Oh, my heart is aching
We're coming to the edge
Running on the water
Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters
Let the river run
Let the river run
Let all the dreamers
wake the nation
Let all the dreamers
wake the nation
Come the New Jerusalem
