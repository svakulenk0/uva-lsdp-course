Sixty. Are you sure you still do?
No.
-- Good then.
What you want? Those brown, or blond?
I want that blonde.
Can you not once your pants
Hold during a wedding?
Make you a joke. The only reason
That awful dress to hold ...
Is that a drunken bruidsjonker
With his teeth to pieces may rupture.

You had to two weddings
On one evening, or not?
This is a bit confusing.
Do not you agree?
They were both very good friends
Mine, and ...
And she married both on the same evening.
So what else should I do?
That is not the confusing part.
How can you do that uithouden?
Is a wedding is not bad enough?
I love weddings,
I always had it done.
Really? -- Yes.
Which part?
The forced cheerfulness, the terrible
Music or bad food?
Actually, it's people meet
Like you.
Love is patient, love is good.
Love means your intellect massacred.

I am a writer.
-- Exactly.
This is my building.

No, I got it.

Honderdveertig, you know what you have done.
Wait, it is so.
Do you not think it is a whole ritual
For something. Let's face it.
We have a chance of fifty,
Fifty to step through the port.
How refreshing. A man who
Not believe in marriage.
I try only the hypocrisy of
The spectacle to demonstrate.
That is noble. Tell you also
Small children that Santa Claus does not exist?
As someone who rubbish
Has become known.
Let's face it, if you believe in marriage,
That is like believing in Santa Claus.
Nope ...
I do not know why I
Discuss with a totally strange ...
But yes, the marriage as well and everything
Important, is not easy.
Cynicism, on the other hand,
That always.
It was very interesting to meet you.
-- See you later. -- Yes.
If you come to my wedding next weekend?
-- I have to go.
How many are you actually?
Welterusten.

How is it gone?
-- Once watch ...
The bride wore a dress
Fonkelde that if the groom his eyes.
He saw her approaching by rain
Of rose petals.

For wedding.
Every girl on this planet, tears
The Sunday open, and looks like the first ...
Bride. Does a murder to
Into it.
Do you have any idea what you might
Are doing?
You mean two women who
On the point of going to marry?
Yes. They will not call you,
You will not harass, which ...
Will act as if they do not even know you.
Since you can not oppose.
Well, it does provide yet
Not much more ...
You look at my ticket to the
Ghetto to be my friend.
Stay but dreams.

I did not want to come to work
In my bruidsmeisjesjurk.
Two days in disgrace walked. Elegant.
What happened last night. We were

An absurd question?
Good morning, Gina.

-- No? Okay, I go find him.
What do those pages of the catalog
George, he wants to see them right away this morning.
No.
-- Do not worry, I get it but of the production.
Let them see who the boss is.
-- I am not the boss.
You are the assistant to the boss.
That is the same.
What's the use
If you do not use that power.
Go to the accounts.
-- Now you are bossy.
Where did I do that damn thing left.
That is a good idea,
For the frontpagina section.
How often have I already not you heard?

Really. The same as your last
Great idea?

This is a turnover of eight hundred,
That is outrageous.
Yes, that's it. Moreover,
No one care.
What then about the piece that I wanted
On the exploitation of workers ...
In the factories where everything by hand
, Which was a topstuk.
Well, that's what people really want
Read in the modesectie.
Kevin, this section will pay nearly
For the entire newspaper ...
Our advertisers want cosy
Colorful human interest stories ...
Against their products.
So it's not about money?
-- Go out.
Okay, that was not good. I get the picture.
But this is.
She was seven weddings.
-- And?
This year. She was there Saturday
Alone two.
It will not only about her,
It will be a penetrating gaze, how ...
Something transformed the wedding industry
, In what should be ...
A very important part in nothing more than
A co ِ peratieve marital power.
On a fun, cheerful way.
Maureen Listen, I go there dead
To those commitments.

The breath of a baby, I always suicide.
This is a true story.
This is what I want to do.
I want you report of weddings.
That is what you are good at, and that
's What I want you do.
Maybe even a few stories,
Then I resigned.
Good. Not a chance.
If I do not like, you go back to
Commitments for the rest of your life ...
With a smile on that handsome face of yours.
-- Deal.
Do you think he will find this fun?
Yes, I think. I think that these photos
For the autumn catalogue ...
George will take you to his office,
And the sweet love with you for hours affiliate.
Tell me that this crazy intense love
The reason is that if you work hard ...
Like you now, because it is confusing.

No. You think George one day
Wake up and realize ...
That he is terribly in love with you, and that
He will be a spectacular gesture of love ...

Feeling that my father to my mother had ...
Maybe I am too busy,

If you just ask her?
Sure.
We can also do a slide show,
Dinner at the trial ...
Like photos of George and me together,
We say funny things.
You know what, that writer where you
So obsessed are ...
He wants a whole 'commitment column'
Making us' the journal. "
He called me, can you believe that?
-- I can certainly not.
I have a lot of thought about what you said,
And I think you certainly have equal.
I think it would be so special,
If I would keep a wedding exactly
Such as that of a mom and dad.
Certainly if I mama's dress wear, then ...
The Boothuis?
When I first called, they said,
That nothing was available ...
The first eighteen months. But when I
For the ninth time called ...
They said that someone had cancelled.
Apparently the bride Saturday with the bruidegoms
Father and brother and sister and all those people ...
And when it was cancelled, they were
All destroyed, but ...
Which means that we have three weeks
To marry.
Three weeks?
Jane, I know that you quickly
For each other.
I would indeed not so long
Wait, then ...
This is a bit of good news for me
Able to find.
That's me, it's only ...
That you also mama's dress in the boathouse
Wanted to marry. I know.
I did not realize that you wanted,
But if it is ...
I just want that you are happy.
That you know.
Can we now have more important things to talk?
I think the tablecloths really not fun.
And I think we need to hire new,
Because they do not fit in the costume
I have chosen.
Those selfish whore.
I can not believe it. There is no one
Who would fall for her.
Even as a goedzak as George.
Men are simply gehypnotiseerd
By her voodoo ...
And then they lose their common sense.
You can be the wedding of your sister does not regulate
With the man from whom you. That is sick.
To be honest, they did not know what I
Felt for him. And he's my boss.
I have come to see over there.
I have no choice.
And you do not. She wants you
Bruidsmeisje her.
You take me in the zeik.
No, I do not.
I am in principle.
I say no, I am in principle.
Calculate but not to me.
Please, let me not only
With all this.
Well, because you are. But if it for me
Cross it, they get a trap under her ass.
And then I give you a trap below
Your ass. Then I take a couple of drinks, and ...
There is no sign that says
Not talking.
Three weeks? That does not succeed.
That is not enough time for one of
My creations.
Remember you can still, that I Shacktor's
Are you brought?
And they ordered that six floors
Heart masterpiece.
And of course, that tower of the Adebelgifts,
Fiësta for those outside.
You can listen to everything and that we know both.
So you make the cake, and you make him
About three weeks, please.
Three weeks? That would be me
A pleasure.
Delicious.
What are you doing here?
-- I am Malcolm Doyle.
What? I would not believe it until
You here.
This is my fiancé, George.
-- Hi, congratulated both of you.
I have to include it. If
A 'tart emergency' is, I am here.
This is Jane, my sister. It
Obsessed with your stories.
It saves them, but if they do
They suggest, but that it does so.
It is your greatest fan.
But not in a narrow way.
You said that you called Kevin.
I use Malcolm in the byline, so
I do not gestalkt by bruidjes mad.
How did you meet George.
-- Klootzak.
He said that he called Kevin, I am
A little confused.
Wait. You know each other.
We work both in the trouwcircuit, then ...
Can you give us even excused.
I have very even talk about you.
Why you lied to me?
No, I said that I was a writer,
Not what I wrote.
But, you wrote the most beautiful things.
Believe you actually in the marriage, and do
You pretend you are a cynic ...
Or are you really a cynic, who knows how
Nonsense he must sell to girls like me.
I could not follow that at all, but
I think the second, which sell nonsense.
It feels as if I have discovered that
Liefdesliedje my favorite ...
On a zeemonster.
Can I address you here for you
George and me to tell?
Sure. That is why I am here.
What? Tess is not.
I am for you.
-- Why?
Come on, I have friends with all
And family talk.
It takes five minutes, please?
For George and Tess?
Thank you.
Can I come inside.
-- Ask me just ask what you want.
Whether you prefer to have
More lie.
I have not lied to you.
I do not know why you always say that.
I might have a few things left out.
-- Can we handle this?
It is bruidsmeisje
A strange young woman.
Vertels agree how you feel about your
Tess its romance.
I could not be happier, it is my
Little sister. I have her learn clock watch ...
I have learned its bicycles, how they
The dishwasher must operate.
I have nearly raised.
Pressure to please not go away, that would
My father his death.
Wait. What are they?
Nothing.
Is it ...?
No.
Your bridesmaids dresses?
-- These are not your things.
Have you kept all. You
A whole closet full. Why?
I have a lot of friends.
And I like to keep them.
That I understand completely.
Because they are beautiful.
They are not so bad.
-- Not so bad?
I would like to see one,
Which is not so bad.
Where have I heard of him?
This.
Seriously.
Vreselijk. Bedoel you that word.
What color is it. Braaksel?
That is olive green, which is very.
And it is very beautiful.
No, I tell you that this is a martelinstrument
, You imposed by a bride ...
Who wants to be that you look ugly.
-- No, Janna has chosen ...
Because everyone well.
Has lichtelijke waanvoorstelling, and
Believe everything everyone tells her.
That is not true, and I will show you
That you have that wrong.
You see, but not that bad.
This side is very beautiful.
Well, you are right about the dress.
That's not so bad, but ...
The color, please.
I think it is by your flash
, Which leaves it strange to look ...
In a normal ...
It is not really beautiful.
It looks a bit like
A shiny mermaid.
But you, you should feel flattered that they
Not next to a beautiful woman wanted so long ...
And you actually wanted neatly
From show.
It is actually not the worst.
If I should choose one from ...
That would be so.
What's that?
-- Bruiloftsthema.
What was the topic?
Humiliation?
People can not go to that kind of weddings.
-- I am there to three.
There's still something.
This you must still show.
-- Enter here.
Very beautiful. Feel you your beautiful?
-- Aanbiddelijk.
Every bride loves
Its accessories.
Men wore dresses,
Women wore suits.
What was the theme there.
-- Wedding in L.A.
Twenty-seven dresses, you take me
In the leg.
I do not understand. You do your thing,
You have the dress, just throw it away.
This is a big closet, you live in
New York you can space if not verkwisten.
How strange that sounds, I
Had a very nice time, in those dresses.
So strange as that may be.
-- I think you do not.
It does not matter to me if someone is me
A rare dress wants to contribute.
It is their day, not mine.
-- God bless you.
And if it means to support them
If they marry, that I ...
Snowshoes with the Ridge
Of the Alps should ...
Or with a rod catch swans, then ...
Have you really done?
-- I am a very good angler.
Hou of angling.
Seriously how much time you have to
That for other people to do?
What has happened to you?
Have you no demands?
No, I did not.
I am Jesus.
One day, God will know when,
But at a time ...
It will be my day.
And then all those people
For me, so ...
If I ever ...
I have your aantekeningenlijst needed.
I thought you would wait below.
What's that?
George is in Talleyrand.
Who's inside?
Nobody.
Let us in the hall talking.
He was looking for a part time job.
He makes the apartment clean.
Tell it is not for George. It is
A secret between Pedro and me.
What do you do now about
Bridesmaids that story.
It is still unworked, I am
Still doing.
I want to see. -- I am ...
Mail it to me.
It is still not finished.
I am still not ready.
Can you please leave.
I have not invited you.
Tess did, if I have a wedding's
Reportage make, I have to see every aspect.
Your sister wants so many different
Offers from many different stores ...
That they are not all they physically
Can register.
She has little time.
It is a short Engagement.
Great God, another?
For you it's just another
Ovenschotel, but Tess ...
It is the pan in which it my mothers
Fried meat for Christmas in.
Can Tess cooking?
Well, I am going to cook, but Tess
Will attend.
With George.
This is not just a vase.
This is a vase that will tackle as Tess
George flowers back home.
Just as he had done before whim.
-- I understand it.
And this is the paraplustandaard with rooster,
George who already have umbrellas bear.
Well, but showed a sukkel.
I just say that it's not just
Stuff.
These are things that one life
Together.
This is the worthless junk that
The twenty-seven trillion dollars a year ...
Trouwindustrie it has convinced us
That we need ...
Or else we are not happy.
You know what I think? I think that all of your
Statistics and theories a rookscherm.
Seriously, what?
-- Your little secret.
Whatever it is. Your parents are divorced.
You have not found the right girl ...
You are afraid that you
Never will.
And I think you so much
Of weddings hold because ...
You prefer you prefer to focus on other people
Their 'kodak moments' ...
Than memories to themselves.
-- You are right.
Weddings are the perfect place to
Forgetting that you are single.
I think you to a wedding,
Not marriage but a wedding.
What is your problem?
Had you your own special wedding, and
Your wife you sometimes abandoned?
Bingo.
-- What?
With my roommate from college
Indeed, so there you get a bingo.
I am sorry, I was only at the gambling.
That was a good one, for a woman who
No insight into himself.
Save the nail precisely on its head.
Do you lelijkste stuff from the store
, And note that for Tess?
Let us do that.
I said that I still have not finished.
-- No, it's good.
I referred to that the fact
Very reasonable.
I must admit that I was shocked,
It is neatly ...
And funny and amusing as hell.
Thank you.
-- You have to really deal with that girl.
We print it, Sunday.
Front page.
Now would you do have to jump up and down
From gratitude.
No, I think that it is not perfect
. I want this really well ...
Wait even a week.
-- You are already months to the begging, and now ...
Do you want me to the story retainer, so
You do what you can comment.
That, I do not.
She is more than that eternal bruidsmeisje.
There is much more to her.
If I knew you better not, I would say
You like her.
Good. I know that I can do better.
It is good as it is.
-- If you give me a week?
One week only.
-- Well, go away.
Thank you so quickly could.
-- That is not a problem.
I am glad that I can help.
And I have experience with food ...
Tess then. So you are
In good hands.

I think it's a great piece,
I think that you are very pleased with it.

That there is no nonsense.
She is not afraid to be herself.
About Tess, there is something I want to say ...
I am so happy for you that you found
Have before you were looking for.
What is your favorite part in
A wedding?
That's easy.
You know, when the music starts, and the bride
Begins its grand entrance,
And everyone turned to in order to
Her watch. Then, I look to the bridegroom.
To his face, it is pure love there.
Therefore I will also go.
If you get married and you make your
Entree ...
Then I have your permission to
To the bridegroom look?
Yes, please do so. And make sure
The poor sukkel intact.
Take me in your leg, a man has
Lucky if you can get it.

I stand on it.
It's like a light bulb. As you

Of course you are overstuur. You plant
The marriage of your sister ...
With the man where you are in love.
You stuck in this narrow love
Triangle ...
And all the time you are not far from road
To get a bullet through your head shots.
That is ridiculous.
Of course you can not say that.
You are that nice Jane, sweet Jane.
You do not know what you talking about.
He's my boss ...
She is my sister. I find it amazing
To care for their wedding.
Just as I am for everyone,
Where I am at.
You can not understand,
Because you ...
Are common, and dark and
Cynical ...
That's your problem friend, not
Mine.
Friends? -- Yes.
Hello friend.
Friend, you calls me friend.
If you keep your mouth.

Let me explain.
I have my editor said that it
Not had copies.
Who reads that fact?
Would you please ...
What's damn happened?
You said that you would stick.
You make those decisions not,

I am not even able to tell her,
She was there to attacks.
Let me give you twenty-four inches
In the Sunday.
You would at this time only
'I love you' have to say.
How could you calling me this?
If the prototype of Jane
A gedienstig bruidsmeisje, then ...
Tess is her sister, the model of a
Arrogant pampered bride in play,
If one thing goes wrong deposit Manhattan.
She eats fire and stores aircraft from the air.
I had no idea that an article he
About me to write.
He called me 'bruidzilla "
The New York Journal.
I can assure him documents cracks,
Bit for bit.

But I am sure one.
Klootzak.

Before you say anything goes,
You can not say anything?
I do not understand where

It is not important.
It is an article ...
On the front with one million photos
Yours.
Who's upset?
Let me explain. I had
No idea what he was writing.
That boy was a dick. He made abuse
Yours. Do not worry about it.

Has anyone here read that piece?

We are talking about it later.
I have thought a lot about that
Failure of an article ...
I have decided to forgive you.
You trust someone just too fast, and I
Do not think that it is your fault.
That is very good of you Tess, thank you.
Are you my list to the nalopen?
About the slide show, I know exactly
What I want you to say is, then ...
So that I listed.
And dad says that you have all the family photos ...
So I tell you, George
Also to you.

But to.
Then you are not again
Embarrassment.
Here it is.
It is beautiful.

What do you think about it?
I thought you mama's dress belt?
It's mom's dress.
Well, parts of it.
It was so old-fashioned. So we have
There here and there pieces of what used.
Pieces?
-- Yes.
Like this, and this side.
You have in your mother's wedding dress cut?
Technically, Mariella has done.
Do not worry, we have
The rest kept for you.
And if you want you can still contribute.
While still in fashion.
I think the only one zoom
Little to be explained.
You do not have to contribute.
It may be you do not care. You give
To no one but yourself.
There were all excuses because mum died
When you was little, but enough is enough.
I have no idea what you are talking about it.
I can no longer out last what
You have just done.
But I can not hurt George you get things done,
He thinks he knows the truth about you ...
But the only thing he knows,
The lies that you have told him.
You have a secret even Pedro
For George to keep.
You tell him the truth now.
He is not one of your 'euro
Nonsense friends' Tess, he's a good man ...
And you can not begin relationship, which
Based on lies.
Really Jane? And you know that, because you
So many have had successful relationships?
You tell him the truth, or
I will do so.
No, you do not, you do not fly evil.
And certainly not me, I am your sister.
That was yesterday. Today you just
Trut one who has broken my heart ...
And my mother's wedding dress in pieces
Cut.
It would indeed you still
Inappropriate.
Jane, you look good.
Fine for you.
Treasury, it must be so difficult to
See ...
That your younger sister earlier
Then you get married.
Yes, that's it.
But then I remind myself,
I can get hot sex ...
Random people I encounter, and
Then I feel so much better.
Have fun at the party.
You look good, even I
Would you may fall.
It is on top of the table, "Tess and George."
Is all well with you?
-- Yes.
This is not water.
Jane, thank you all done
Have. It's great.
Look, if you like this one, Tess?
No, I do not eat that stuff, Jane.
Precisely, I get the picture.
We will change the slideshow.
You will still only say what
I have written down, right?
Sure. The perfect bruidsmeisje
Always does what its demands.
You are not afraid, do you?
Hello, everyone.
In case you have not
Have read,
I have my share of weddings
However.
So to begin, I think you all
Need to know the truth about Tess and George.
Tess and George are a perfect pair.
No, a superior pair.
A couple whose love
The elements of a fairy tale.
They would fit together exactly,
It only can be described ...
As designed by the gods.
Since a picture says more than
Thousand words ...
I have a slide show composed, so
You can see it all themselves.
From the very beginning, were Tess and George
Destined for each other.
George and Tess have always love
Shared for God's furry creatures.
When she grew up, she showed the same
Level of dedication and conviction ...
For their training.
And the same responsibility.
He was interested
In international affairs ...
And that she was, too.
And today share Tess and George
Still the same values.
Their love is based on a great concept
And acceptance ...
About who that other person
Really is.
The love of two zielsverwanten true,
Tess and George.
So at the perfect couple,
Together by fate.
I am so proud of you, little sister.
Well, that was then ...
For the cheerfulness is to keep ...
George wants his little brother Pedro,
Even a few words.
So, you may say,
That you are not a vegetarian.
Firstly, it is a very long time
Ago.
Where you actually wore
When your engagement?
As you all know,
George is my big brother.
But he is more than that.
He is my best friend.
And now, George, Tess.
It's really very cool,
Because they are my own cleaning business
Helps set up.
Tess told me that you should not
Tell George, but ...
I am so excited, I am now
George at his home, but ...
But anyone who likes something good
Cleaned wants ...
Come to me in the hall.
Thank you!
That's great.
No, it is ...
George, wait please.
Let me explain.
What happened?
He had to know the truth.
You had him right
In his face can say.
I know that my moral compass nor
Points to the north, but ...
If I say that something is not good,
It is not something good.
You are the one who always says that
I propose myself to be.
Yes, but that's not what you
Already.
What you did was twenty years of suppressed
Feelings in an evening Release.
It was entertaining, understand me
Not wrong.
If that was the right thing to do, then
Now would you feel better.
Feel you can now better?
The wedding is not, I hope
That you are happy.
What? Why are you here?
You have not answered my phone calls.
-- What do you want?
Do you have a different picture in your newspaper?
Jane, please forgive me.
-- You have used me ...
To continue with your career,
Be a man and admit it ...
Or do not. But please do
Not if you are an order Thursday.
Please let me explain.
-- No, it does not matter.
I have just destroyed my life. And I
Had there not with your help.
Great, finally.
I saw what you did,
And it was amazing.
It was certainly not absolutely correct,
But you have done something, Jane.
For the first time, you not
The perfect bruidsmeisje.
I no longer start here with you. I know
Not even why I talk to you.
Listen to me.
Do you know the real reason why I
I come here tonight?
Because I knew that this is difficult
For you would be.
And for the first time in a very long
I wanted time for someone.
I am ruined, and that I am sorry ...
And I turn to me, and walk away.
I disappear, and you will see me no more.
I promise, but I want you know ...
That you earn more, than anywhere
You now satisfied with.
I think you deserve that other methods
The change you care to imagine.
That, I believe.
I forgot to give you this.
It is a gift, so you no longer
That crazy agenda from 1978 to having to drag.
This will provide for all the things
You should do ...
Perfect for starting over.
Would you please adopt, so
I do not feel as a dick?
The story has superb reactions
.
It seems as if you yourself from the commitments'
Have worked.
That's great.
Kevin, be happy now, you have
Got what you wanted, right?
I am saying only that you two sisters,
You need that uitpraten.
That, I know, but I say you do,
That she does not want to talk.
No, she loves you.
Everything will be good.
You must ...
-- Papa?
What does it damn here?
-- Tess, this is between you and her ...
I am here.
Have you seen that new herbicide?
I feel terrible.
I am sorry if what happened.
-- Spijt?
You humiliated me for everyone
I know ...
And you think you just 'I am sorry'
Can say?
I know.
-- You were always jealous of me.
What?
-- Always. On my clothes ...
On my friends.
-- Keep it there.
You have just waited on the opportunity,
On me to get down.
That's it. And you have the only
In my life taken away ...
That finally came.
-- Please Tess, which is so typical ...
You take no responsibility
That you have lied against George.
You have manipulated him.
What do you with the muggenspray?
Hield you from him, or he
You only useful?
Please Jane, not just talk
Pretending you know everything better.
Provides but now that I tegensta you,
Because you always had to do my hair ...
Halloween and my clothes had to make ...
And my dress for the eindfeest from school
Had to buy.
No, it has not been all me.
-- Yes, that is true.
You always thought that my life
So easy.
That was the case, it is.
You have never had a concern, you are beautiful,
And fun and charming. Your life is perfect.
Perfect, are you crazy?
You have no idea. You want the real reason
Know why I wanted to stay in New York?
I am fired.
And that was the height Rudolfo
Dumped me.
He dumped me.
And then came George, and he
Was nice to me.
He treated me good, you know?
I just wanted someone,
He would like.
I tried to be someone he
Earned, someone he respected ...
I tried to yours.
Why?
Why would you want me, as
You yourself can be?
This is a mess.
-- I know it.
Jane, you did for me to try to ensure
Since deceased mother.
That I had to do.
-- No, it was not you.
But if I did not ...
-- If you did not ...
You just had my sister.
And that is what it should be.
Perhaps when I was young,
You had to help me, but now ...
Now you have to stop to provide me,
With ensuring everyone.
Yes, that's no problem.
Sure.
I am true.
You look great.
I think it is not me you are David
Liefdadigheidsvoorstelling have to search.
I believe it.
George, before we go anywhere, let
I apologize for last night ...
I did not have to do
What I did.
You did me a service.
It is not your fault that I went marry
With someone I hardly knew.
What I thought really, right?
What do you think?
Shall we all just forget?
If you know for sure.
-- I am sure.
I do not turn to ask a favor,
But I have my speech
For printing tonight ...
And I can not find the file.
-- I grab it.
Jane, I am so grateful to you that I
Tonight could call.
I can always count on you, you
Never say no.
Against the love.
What?
I referred only ...
Sorry, I said something wrong?
George, I assume dismissal.
I assume dismissal.
-- What do you mean? I take resign?
When I came from school, I was
Under the impression of this case, and you ...
I was so busy with the matter, which I
I do not pressure made my own life ...
I think if I felt on my convenience,
That I do not think it was necessary to leave.
And then I had to see you here every day,
As terrible as I was in love with you.
Verschrikkelijk love, idiot.
It will go well with you, George.
You get someone for this job, which ...
Ultimately up to two years continues,
Because that is acceptable and suitable ...
I am sorry, that was quite
Suddenly ...
No, it's good. I always like
Know how that would feel.
And?
Nothing. I felt nothing.
That hurts.
Maybe we can still
Try once?
No, nothing. And you?
If I am honest?
Not really.
-- It does not feel like it should feel.
If the person is where you
Belongs, it would be ...
What's that?
I must go.
Today you can
All kinds of problems ...
Because if we do as four in a row ...
Sorry, do you know of Malcolm Doyle there?
He is married to his last beating.
You are that girl from that article,
You are famous.
Pier 17.
Did you ...
-- I have only one dress tonight. So it Ga.
Come on.
-- Go.
Success.
Where's the wedding?
-- Here inside.
This is a good, I got it.
Thanks a lot.
Is all well with you?
-- Everything is fine with me.
Everything is fine.
No, you are that girl from that article.
What are you doing here?
A long story in a few words.
There is this man ...
Tell me more.
Since he is.
You can, say it.
I just wanted to say that you are right
Had on me.
Over all, I just wanted to
Not heard.
Certainly not you.
Can the spotlight?
There you are.
Kevin, I have my whole life on
Waiting for the right man ...
And when you came up, and ...
You are not like me
This man had, you are ...
Cynical and curious, and ...
Impossible.
But the truth is,
That you are fighting ...
Is the best that I ever
Overcome.
And I think there is a good chance,
I love your word.
That's it. That is all
I wanted to say.
I Go.
Kevin, I wanted ...
Come here.
One year later
Tell me again, why is
This wedding special.
Who are you?
I am writing the commitment section
'The Journal'.
Perhaps we can soon
Something to drink?
Bring it to the bar,
You get something from me to drink.
There is Tess.
Do you think they would fall on me.
I am now a year older.
I do not know, I do it
A good word for you, big boy.
I bruidsmeisje.
I live in Bloomsburg,
With a roommate ...
And I have just begun designing
My own great handbags.
And I sit entirely on the ground,
But that's not very ...
I eat a hamburger a day, and my
Idea of a pet is a stone.
It is very nice to meet you too.
Wacht maar tot jij de bruid ziet.
She looks beautiful.
Are you ready?
Everything is perfect.
The best with this dress, that you
Shorter can create and then can bear.
That is absolutely true.
Are you ready?
That day I woke up and I went
My twenty-eighth dress.
I went to a wedding where no one
Asked me for the bouquet to hold.
Or to the tafelkaartje to expand, or their dress
Keep up if they were puddles.
Everything was perfect, and it might
I do not care.
Was the one on me at the waiting
, At the end of the aisle .
And he looked at me as I always
Had hoped.
Is it time now where everything
You had hoped?
No.
It is more, it's much more.
Beloved present, we
Are here today together ...
To behold and that Jane Nickols
Kevin Doyle in the marriage act.
I knew it all in one day
I would be .
Then I declare you now man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
