Run, run, run.
He's gonna get you.
Good. He's dead.
It's semi-conscious Keith.
Hi, ugly.
CAROL: Hi, honey.
How was work?
All right.
Keith, you still
haven't told me when
you're gonna cut your hair.
I got it cut, Mom.
CINDY: Mom, you're
flapping your lips in vain.
Keith vacated.
CLIFF: Keith! Keith,
is that you?
Yup.
CLIFF: Hey, pal.
Been checking out some colleges.
Dad, you going to college?
That's great.
If I'd have gone to college,
I wouldn't be selling tires
six days a week.
That's what
you're gonna be doing
if you don't get
with the program.
Now, come here.
Take a look
at a couple of these.
A bunch of new ones
came in the mail today.
Coed phys ed.
Can I do this later?
Jesus, Keith.
I'm not trying
to break your back here, pal.
I know.
Just want you to
get off the dime
and think about your future.
You got a shot
to be the first guy
in this family
who didn't have to
wash his hands
after a day's work.
Coed phys ed.

PLAYING THE HARDEST WALK
Hey.
Hi. I'm looking for that song
about the guy
that killed himself
for the girl
that hated his guts.
Do you know what song
I'm talking about?
Do you understand the concept
of the word "privacy"?
Yes, I do.
And that's why I never
let anyone in my room.
Get out of here before I throw
your ass out my window.
God, are you
in a nice mood today.
I said get out of here.
Keith, is this
a side effect of being
massively unliked
or... or what?
If I get
a black and blue mark,
you monger, you're dead!
Mom!
Look at it.
You see what he did to me?
Get your head
out of the light.
There. Ow.
Sweetheart, I can't say
that I see anything.
I'm sure it hurts.
Well, Mom,
then you need some glasses.
At this point,
if I wanted to lie out,
I could not wear a bathing suit.
You know, exposing your skin
to sunlight
will make you old
before your time.
And eventually, you'll look
like an albino raisin.
Thank you, Cindy.
It's my pleasure.
CLIFF: Stay out of his room.
KEITH: Yeah.
And you.
You see me
if you got a problem with her
before you start
roughing her up.
What... What,
what right does she have
to break into my room, Dad?
And I did not rough her up.
She's...
I have
practically no feeling left
in the upper part of my arm.
Drop it.
You know, that suggests
a circulatory problem.
See, I'd put more fiber
into my diet
and spend less time
on the phone.
Shut up, please?
It's my pleasure.
I wish, just once, you guys
could experience
the humiliation
of having the weirdest guy
in a huge school
be a blood relative.
I think
your father said drop it.
This whole family
revolves around Keith
and I'm sick of it.
Laura,
that is absolutely not true
and you know it.
Excuse me.
Keith, honey, you haven't
finished your dinner.
You know,
I don't think I've had
a balanced meal here.
I think I'm missing one
of the important food groups.
CLIFF: Hey, Keith!
What about these colleges?
I expect an answer!
WATTS: Did you get
your eight essential
vitamins today?
Are you aware of
how close that was?
Come on, Mr. Sunshine.
Skill beyond skill.
Technique.
Imagine what I can do
when I get my
driver's license back.
Hey, what...
Where are...
Where are...
Don't you have any books?
Oh.
No, not on me.
I forgot them.
Never... You never study.
You must be getting heat
from the old man
about college again.
That's all he thinks about.
Yeah, well,
in comparative terms
it's probably better to have
an old man nagging you
about your future
than no old man
not nagging you
about nothing.
Things not too great
at home, huh?
Hey, it don't matter,
as long as you stand by me,
I'm covered.
Where would I be without you?
Well, seeing as I drive you
to school every morning
you'd probably be at home
asleep in bed.
Do you mind?
Very much so.
WATTS: I think
it's hip you paint.
I think it's hip I drum.
Hip.
It-It's perfect
that we're friends.
You know,
I'm beginning to think...
Pardonnez-moi.
Pardonnez-moi? Pardonnez-moi.
Merci.
Now that's original.
How long you been
pulling that one?
Watts.
DUNCAN: Wait, wait, wait.
How long have you
been a lesbian, huh? Huh?
Excuse me?
Well, I think, I think
that you have a little bit
too much up front
to be a guy,
so you must be a lesbian.
I beg your pardon?
You know, I think you got
a little bit
too much breastage here
WATTS: Shut up!
Hey.
Okay, you fucking faggot,
come on.
GIRL: Duncan!
That's enough!
WATTS: Leave him alone.
Break it up! Break it up!
That's enough!
Come on, man.
WATTS: Animal.
Clear out.
Wimp.
Oh, sweetheart.
See. Wait a minute, okay?
They jumped me.
Why don't you nail them?
I didn't do anything.
Those aren't mine.
Oh, man, that's just for show.
I don't...
It's like, those were
a gift from, from your wife.
You just got detention, mister.
For what?
For what?
Come on. We'll talk about it
in detention hall.
DUNCAN: For what?
What's this?
Isabella of Spain.
Women who rule.
Are we getting feisty.
What?
Yo! Are you sitting down?
No. I'm... I'm walking
down the hall.
Right.
Why?
I've, I've got some
bad news for you.
Hey. What? What?
It's unconfirmed
but I... I got it
from a reliable source.
What?
I think your father's in school.
Has Keith decided
on a school yet?
Well, uh, we're...
we're zeroing in on a few.
Well, he indicated to me
that he was interested
in a couple of art schools.
Ah, I don't think
that's gonna happen.
He comes out of art school,
what's he qualified to do?
I'm looking for a good
business program.
I think he has
a good head for business.
Well, uh,
the indications I've gotten
are that he's more
creatively inclined.
Fine.
But we're looking
for a business school.
He wants to be creative
he can do that
in his spare time.
How's he doing otherwise?
Fine.
Grades holding up okay?
Um, very well.
Well, thanks for the help.
Oh, well.
Call me anytime you have
a question. Don't hesitate.
I will. Thank you.
I appreciate it.
You're welcome.
Keith Nelson.
Could I ask you a question
about, um, number five
on Page 3?
Hi, honey!
Can I go to the nurse?
HARDY: Trust is the basis
of any relationship.
I trust you.
Now, I want you to stay close,
but not too close.
You back off when I say, okay?
Do both your parents work?
Yeah?
Maybe I'll stop
by after school
one day this week.
Hi.
Go ahead. See you later.
HARDY: Amanda.
Hi.
Want to go to your place?
What's wrong?
Do you mind?
Yes, I do.
I want to know what's wrong.
She's a friend
of my little sister.
Her brother was
in a pretty serious
car accident
and she's a little upset.
I know you're coming.
I'm waiting for you.
Why would I be trying
to make it with another girl?
How can you be so beautiful
and so insecure
at the same time?
Trust is the basis
of any relationship.
I trust you.
And I want to give you this.
I'll go get the car
and I'll meet you out front.
*
Hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't.
That belongs to the slumlord
that owns this place.
It's his pride and joy.
It's pretty sick.
How does it feel
to stand under
a real Mercedes-Benz?
About the same as standing
underneath a Ford.
Why? You get off on it?
Can I ask a question?
Do you know a girl
named Amanda Jones?
Uh, well, in school?
Cool. What about her?
What do you think of her?
Rat bait. Why?
Just curious.
What about?
Her. Who she is.
Because she's beautiful, right?
Guys are so sickening.
Really, it must be a drag
to be a slave
to the male sex drive.
I didn't say anything about sex.
Oh. You want to start
a book club with her?
I didn't say that I wanted
to do anything with her.
I just think she's interesting.
Don't go mistaking paradise
for a pair of long legs.
What does that mean?
Don't go roaming
where you don't belong.
It's just an opinion.
I express
an interest in someone
that I don't even know
and you're getting tense.
This is not tension,
this is reason.
The way this girl
and her big money,
cruel-heart society
spit on everyone,
is not interesting,
it's pathetic.
She's not big money.
Do you know where she lives?
Yeah, in our sector.
But she runs with the rich
and the beautiful,
which is guilt by association.
So?
This is getting stale.
You calling out for food?
No. You can call if you want.
Don't you ever eat at home?
I...
I don't like to eat alone.
Amanda Jones?
Forget about it.
It's nothing.
It's not important.
WATTS: You couldn't score her
in a million years.
A: You're too shy
and closed up
to even approach her.
And B: She'd kill you.
Chicks like her
have one thing on their mind,
and you don't
make enough of it
to matter to her.
Well, you can't judge a book
by its cover.
Yeah, but you can tell
how much it's gonna cost.
That's deep.
You want shallow,
call Amanda Jones.
*
Speak of the she-devil.
Could you fill it up?
Super unleaded.
HARDY: Check the oil.
Can you turn off
your engine, please?
My pleasure.
Hey, be nice
or I'll make you
check the tires.
So this is what you
do for a living, huh?
I'm... I'm sorry.
My hand slipped. I...
Would you cut it out?
Why don't you
mind your own business.
HARDY: So, you like
looking at my girlfriend?
AMANDA: Shut up, Hardy.
What?
He likes looking at you.
Sorry.
I'd recommend you keep your eyes
and your mind off my property.
Here's $10 for the gas
and $10 for the look.
*
* Down and down she goes
* Our Amanda Jones
* I said, down and down
and down and down *
* She'd look
really lovely at home *
* Till somebody gonna
come up and ask her *
* To live happily ever after
* Miss Amanda Jones
* Miss Amanda Jones
* Round and round
and round and round *
* Round and round
and round and round *
* Round and round
and round and round *
MRS. ALBRIGHT:
Oh, Amanda Jones.
Right this way, please.
I'd say excusing
yourself from class
and leaving
the school grounds
with the boy with the hot car
buys you two weeks
of morning detention.
Well, we were just talking.
If all you'd wanted was talk
you could've gotten that
without leaving school.
What are you saying,
Mrs. Albright?
Nothing that
hasn't been said before,
Miss Jones.
Now, get inside.
Get inside.
It's not fair.
Read my lips. Go.
Welcome.
Is... Is this detention?
Actually,
it's your mother's house
and we're all having a party.
MR. SAUNER: You know,
you really shouldn't
cut classes, Amanda,
even if it's just gym class.
Well,
it's incredibly nice of you
not to make me sit down there
with those guys.
I felt kind of weird,
you know, being the only girl.
I suppose it wouldn't matter
if you served out your
detention in my office.
Oh, well,
I kind of had a better idea.
Mmm-hmm.
I was kind of wondering
if I... I wouldn't
have to serve detention at all,
if I promised
I'd never ever do it again.
We'll keep this
just between you and me.
Oh, you're incredibly sweet,
Mr. Sauner.
And I love the way
you wear your hair.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's great.
All the girls say it.
No.
Yeah.
It's true.
You're the best
drivers' ed teacher there is.
Thank you.
Thanks very much.
Sure. Bye-bye, Amanda.
Bye.
WATTS: Amanda Jones
doesn't know you,
doesn't care about you.
You're trying to
jerk off the impossible.
How many times
do I have to listen
to myself tell you this?
I don't know. How many times?
Do you know what kind
of a guy Hardy is?
Handsome, rich,
muscular, popular,
hot, happening
and capable of
reducing your head
to a crimson stain on the wall.
Hardy's a jerk.
He... He screws around on her,
he treats her like dirt,
he has no respect for her.
He's just...
And obviously
she gets off on it.
You're losing it.
And when it's lost
all you are is a loser.
You obviously have
no idea how I feel,
so, why don't you just
butt out of this, please.
I know how you feel.
Oh, you do? Really?
You've been in love before?
There's a lot of things
you don't know about me.
Really?
Who've you ever
been in love with?
Huh?
You want to abuse yourself,
be my guest.
Hey, Watts,
nothing ventured,
nothing gained.
Right?
Keith,
once a fool
always a fool, right?
Hmm.
Are those boys' underpants?
Yeah. So?
So, I've just never seen a girl
wearing boys' underpants before.
You ever seen a girl
with a drumstick
shoved up her nose?
Oh, is that some
kind of a threat?
It's some kind of a warning.
I'm petrified. Really.
HARDY: All right, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.
I've done this before.
There's Amanda.
Hi.
Hi.
Hardy, I've had
about enough of this.
What? What?
Look,
if you were more of a person
you might be enough
for two girls.
But you're not.
Yeah?
Well, this jealousy crap
is really
getting a bit tedious.
Yeah, well, you won't have
to deal with it anymore.
What?
What does that mean? Huh?
Get out of my way.
No, no, no.
Not until
we straighten this out.
It's not gonna
work anymore, Hardy.
Yeah?
You walk out on me,
where you gonna go? Hmm?
KEITH: Amanda!
You... You got a minute?
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
What do you want?
Well,
Uh, I wanted to know if maybe
you wanted to go out
with me.
But, but, if it's
too difficult a time
then... then
I... I understand that.
I'm... I just... Um...
Oh.
You're... So you're asking me
out on a date?
Goodbye.
Bye.
So what did he want?
He asked me out.
What'd you say?
I said yes.
She's just mad.
Some juice.
Why are you smiling?
I wasn't aware
that I was smiling,
but if it bothers you
then I can stop.
No, it's just you haven't
smiled much lately.
I was curious about the change.
Well, I haven't had that much
to smile about, Clifford.
You have
a beautiful smile, young man.
Thank you, Carol.
She's Mom. I'm Dad.
And you're nuts.
LAURA: This is not true.
It can't be.
This has got to be, like,
the most hilarious rumor
ever floated. Right?
CAROL:
What are you talking about?
Okay. I'm in town last night,
I hear everybody talking about
how Keith has
asked this girl out.
CINDY: No way.
Yeah. Check it out.
This girl is popular,
she's beautiful,
and obviously in the middle
of some emotional shootout
to consent to date
the human Tater Tot.
What did you do to her, Keith?
Threaten her life?
I just asked her out.
Her boyfriend's a man,
for Christ's sake.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
He's extensively
easy on the eyes.
He's a total buck and you're...
You're Keith.
Is she nice?
Mother, the girl is sex.
For God's sakes, I'm eating.
Glad you got time
to think about the girls.
Between the girls
and your art kick,
you don't have time to think
about anything important.
I'll be dead and buried
before you get off your butt
and apply to a college.
LAURA: Ease up, Dad.
Any fool could
get into a college.
Only a precious few may say
the same about Amanda Jones.
Am I wrong?
Carol.
CINDY: Mom, what kind of milk
did you say this was?
Sweetheart,
if you don't like the milk,
drink the juice.
It's none of your business.
What, Keith?
Did you see the brochure,
Keith...?
What did you say?
DUNCAN:
It's what my girlfriend
would look like without skin.
Yeah. Nice.
And while we're on the topic
of the double-breasted
party machine,
congratulations
on your latest coup.
Yeah.
You know about Amanda Jones?
How?
You think I live here?
I have a personal life,
too, man.
How did you manage
to swing that one?
I don't know, Duncan.
You know, I... I asked her out.
She said yes. We're...?
Anytime somebody
from the outside
lifts a woman
from a gwat like Jenns, man,
we could all find
cause to rejoice.
I'm proud of you.
Gwat?
A gwat, man.
Punch her apron
one time for me, yeah?
RAY:
Do you want me to kiss you
or feel you up or anything?
You wanna die young?
What kind of question is that?
Just sit here and shut up.
You don't have a boyfriend,
do you?
No.
See, a lot of guys I know
think that you're...
What?
Confused.
Oh.
See,
but I know it's just an act.
Do you know how I know?
Enlighten me.
'Cause you radiate
this sexual vibe.
And if you wanted to
you could be
a girl like that.
Ray, this is 1987.
Did you know
that a girl can be
whatever she wants to be?
I know. My mom's a plumber.
That explains
a lot about you, Ray.
And I have an enormous amount
of respect for her.
WATTS: Just sit here
and act like you like me.
Okay. That'll be
absolutely no problem.
Hello.
Keith, hi. What's up?
Listen, are... are you busy now?
Oh, no, we were just talking.
Why?
'Cause I'd like
to borrow your car,
if I could.
If you... If you need...
If you have something to do
I could come back around
and pick you up
in about an hour or so.
But can I borrow your car?
Well, where are you going?
I'd like to give Amanda
a ride home.
Hey, by the way,
congratulations, dude.
Man, she's smoking, you know.
All right.
Thanks.
Is that... Is that okay?
I'd appreciate
a couple bucks for gas.
Well, sure.
Guess I'll come back
in about an hour?
It's just time.
Not like it means anything.
Thanks.
So, you gotta wait
around an hour?
If I want to.
Do you know how much damage
we could do to
each other in an hour?
It's kind of
a revolting thought, actually.
Really?
What's "revolting" mean?
Oh, my God.
Get your hands off me, man.
Does that mean
you want to come over?
For spring break?
Are you out of your mind?
All right, that's it.
I'm taking you to Aspen.
I won't take you to Aspen.
I'll take you to Chile.
Amanda. Hello.
Hi.
Would you like a ride home?
Uh, well, I'm... I'm
I'm going home with Shayne.
Shayne, this is Keith.
Keith, Shayne.
Hello.
Hi.
Uh, well, I was just
hoping we could talk.
Why don't you call me?
KEITH: Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh. Why don't you go with him?
Okay. I'm... I'm sorry.
Uh, where's your car?
Well, I'll pull around.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
What?
Well, you made me
look really stupid.
I did not make you
look really stupid.
He's giving you
the perfect opportunity
to back out.
He wants to talk.
So, tell him.
Tell him you're back with Hardy.
I'm not back with Hardy.
Okay, then fine.
Tell him the truth.
Tell him that you used him.
I didn't use him.
Oh, really?
You didn't use him
to get away from Hardy?
It wasn't deliberate.
I was mad and he stepped in.
It was just bad circumstances,
okay?
Okay.
Regardless, the longer
you wait to kill it,
the worse it's gonna be.
You saw his face.
I mean, he's completely deluded.
Unless, of course,
you're really
interested in him.
Start.
Please.
The car won't start.
Oh, no!
Wait, wait, wait.
Shayne! Shayne!
AMANDA: Shayne!
Oh, damn it. Look, uh,
I got to get home.
I... I really do.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no, no, I understand.
It's fine. It's fine.
I'll see you later.
What?
Can I have a ride?
What happened to
Prince Charming?
AMANDA: Keith! Come on.
Do you... It's okay?
Come on!
No door.
Get in.
SHAYNE: You in?
KEITH: Yup.
So where are we going?
Home.
Where's that?
Um, D Street.
It's around the corner
from my house.
Under the bridge from my house.
*
Those are nice earrings.
Oh, thank you.
They're not mine.
I borrowed them from Shayne.
They're real.
What?
Amanda, isn't there something
that you wanted to say to...
I'm sorry,
what's your name again?
Keith.
Oh, yeah. Keith.
Do you wanna
back out of the date?
No, I... I...
I mean, if you...
if you want out
I'll understand.
I wouldn't have asked you out
if I didn't want to go
in the first place.
I don't want out. Do you?
No.
KEITH: It's the white house
up on the left.
Here at the mailbox.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
You okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Thanks.
Well, that was swift.
I gave you a perfect window
to throw him out of
and you went limp.
Look, maybe you can
do something like that,
but I can't.
At least not in cold blood.
Well, then
I guess you got yourself
a new boyfriend.
Hi, guys. Did you come by
to see my brother?
Oh, my God.
Um, what?
No. I mean,
we just dropped him home.
And he told you we live here?
He is so modest,
it kills me.
I... I suppose
he didn't mention anything
about our ancestral estate
in Scotland
or our apartment in Paris?
So modest.
Hi, assface.
I just saw
your girlfriend outside.
Did she say anything to you?
Well, that's for me to know
and for you to find out.
I'm gonna beat it out of you.
Mom!
Tell me! Tell me!
Let go!
RAY: Look,
how far are you going?
To the nearest gas station.
Wonderful. How far is that,
Russia or something?
Don't worry about it.
You're young.
Not anymore.
Look, you better give me
your phone number after this.
*
* I'm at the stage
* Where everything I thought
meant something *
* Seems so unappealing *
How you doing?
All right.
You nervous about something?
No. No.
You look nervous.
You okay?
No, I'm fine.
Do you always, uh,
come to school this early?
KEITH: No. No. Do you?
Never.
So, why, why today?
I wanted to talk to you.
About?
Not about art.
Look, I'm totally cool
with the situation.
The truth is I was
looking for a way out
of the thing with Amanda
and you saved me a tough talk.
I'm supposed to
believe this, right?
It's true. I don't want
Amanda hating me.
I don't want anybody hating me.
So, I'd appreciate it
if you'd do me a favor.
Now, I don't know what
you have planned for Saturday
but if you could,
I'd like you to
swing by my place.
I'm having a party.
Parents are in Europe.
You're... You're inviting me
to your house?
Yeah,
I invited a lot of people.
Something wrong?
Gee, I...
Well, I don't know.
You... You tell me.
There's nothing wrong on my end.
You got
an inferiority complex
or something?
I've known Amanda a long time
and I'd like to
keep it that way.
If it's too much for me
to ask you to
bring her to a party,
hey, I'm sorry I asked.
Well, put yourself
in my position.
This doesn't sound too good.
Well, put yourself
in my position.
I'm big enough to invite
a former girlfriend
and the guy
who stole her from me
to a party.
Do you think
this makes me look good?
I've taken a lot of shit
over this.
That's why
I'm a little cautious
about your motives.
I'll buy that.
Come on. It's a party.
It is not the end of the world.
Are you being straight with me?
Do you see
any reason at this point
why I should play games?
Well, I'll... Ahem.
I'll talk to Amanda
about it. But...
I've already talked to her
and she's fine with it.
You talked to her?
Really?
Well, we'll drop by then.
Good.
You know what?
It wouldn't be the weirdest
thing in the world
if you and I
actually turned out
to be friends.
Yes, it would.
See you.
You got a coat and tie?
No.
See you Saturday.
*
* You took the words
right from my lips *
* Without asking
* I've played the scene
before and I won't *
* be the one left crying
* And if you think
that love's for sale *
* Well I'm not buying
* What you've bought before
you can buy no more *
* 'Cause I'm all out of love,
I can't take no more *
* Still I wake at night
and I call your name *
* Dreaming of you
* I wake at night
always the same *
* I call your name
but you sleep right through *
* And love is the light
in your face *
Since when do your parents
let you go clubbing
on school nights?
I'm waiting for Amanda.
Here? She's coming here?
On a school night?
Did I miss something?
Is there a new world order?
Look, if you're gonna bug me
and make me feel bad,
can you do it later? Please.
She said she'd meet you here?
Not in those words.
In any words?
Maybe she didn't have ID.
Who doesn't have ID?
Maybe she doesn't like you
as much as you think.
Maybe.
* Dreaming of you
Do you miss me, Keith?
Do you miss not
being around me?
This isn't
the third grade anymore.
She doesn't love you.
It's a joke. It's all a joke.
How do you know?
I'd bet my hands on it.
* Love won't pass you by
You don't want to make that bet.
Yeah, I do.
I've been
thinking a lot lately
about you and me.
* I know now, I know now
And I came to a conclusion
that I didn't
want to deal with.
But now that we talked,
I can't hide it anymore.
I think we'd get along
much better
if we didn't spend
so much time
together anymore.
Why?
Because I'm driving you crazy
and you're driving me crazy.
And I'd rather not see you
and have you think
good things about me,
than have you
see me and hate me.
* I know now
'Cause I can't afford
to have you hate me, Keith.
The only things I care about
in this goddamn life
are me and my drums and you.
* Turn to the sky
* I know now
Adios.
Wait, Watts.
Watts!
* Love is the light
in your face *
* Turn to the sky
* I know now
* I know your eyes don't lie *
It's 10 after.
Miss Albright's
gonna kill us.
Hi.
Get lost, Hardy.
You still mad at me?
Can we talk?
No.
Please?
This is cute.
I wanna talk to you.
AMANDA: It's too late.
I've been in agony over this.
I doubt it.
What do I have to do
to convince you
that I love you?
Start by leaving me alone.
I'm late.
You're going out
with lowlife
just to hurt me.
And you know what?
It's working. It hurts. Okay?
Is that why you have
all your friends
trying to convince me
to go to your house?
So you can prove
what a stud you are
by beating him up?
Where did you hear that?
Give me a little credit,
why don't you?
True, I invited him.
Not to beat him up.
To show you
what a good loser I am.
You're not a good loser.
You're just a loser. Period.
What is this?
What is this?
I am talking to Amanda.
Could I please have
two minutes to finish.
Thank you.
What is your name?
Do you mind?
There is nothing here
that I have not
seen before, okay?
Amanda, can I drive you home?
What is your name?
Hardy Jenns,
with two "n's." all right?
All right, that's it.
Get out. Go on, out!
I really
appreciate this, lady.
Be a bitch, why don't you?
Look,
consider yourself reported.
Now get out of here.
Amanda,
your reputation's hanging
in the balance here.
You play me around
and you're gonna have
a real lonely year.
So I hear.
Look, I am not playing.
Just get out of here.
Amanda, may I see you
for a minute, please?
I am his sister.
So if you're a brother
or a sister, you're in.
It's like... It's like
they have to accept you
or else the whole
social structure caves in.
Get to go to parties?
Of course.
I'm probably going to
the one Saturday
at Hardy Jenns'.
Keith's bringing Amanda,
so you know, we might double.
Who'd go out with you?
LAURA: The choices
are limitless.
Can we go, too?
Eventually, yeah, uh,
if you stay cool.
GIRL: You're lying.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
If you're so tight
with Hardy's people,
why aren't you
over there with them?
Because I'm here
with you, twerp.
Maybe you're here
because you're false.
Is this a challenge
or something?
Yeah.
Look,
I was hanging with you fungi
in a vain effort
to cool you out.
But all I am
getting is breeze,
so c'est la vie.
She's a liar.
Her brother loathes her.
He'd never let her play
with his rep.
Amanda has to bring him.
What else can she do?
Not bring him.
She can't take the pressure,
she'll bring him. All right.
Now the party will go down
as expected, okay?
Amanda will blow in
with her guy,
and we'll nail him.
Then we'll go
back to business as usual.
It's real simple.
All right?
Hey, Laura, what happened?
They send you for beer?
Well, I guess
you just wouldn't be you
if you knocked before
breaking into my room.
I'm sorry, Keith,
I thought if I knocked,
you wouldn't open up
and I wanna talk to you.
Well,
this should be interesting.
I heard something today
at the mall.
Hardy Jenns
and his guys were there
and I heard them
talking about you.
What's your point, Laura?
Keith, it's a joke.
Amanda Jones,
the date, the party,
the whole thing.
It's a joke.
She's only going out with you
so she can get you
to Hardy Jenns' house
so he can mess you up.
I heard Hardy say it, Keith.
I heard him myself.
It's true.
You're not kidding.
It's a joke?
Yeah.
Keith, I'm sorry
for everything.
*
You're getting really good.
Thanks. I'm working on it.
Your brothers don't mind
you playing this late?
I don't know. I never asked.
To what do I owe this honor?
I got...
I got a little problem.
You know how
you told me the thing
with Amanda was a joke?
Yeah.
Well, it is a joke.
You mean a joke
as in a joke on you?
Yep.
Laura heard Hardy
talking about it.
And Amanda's supposed
to get me over
to Hardy's house
and they're gonna pound me.
It's a good thing
you found out about it.
I'm not afraid of him.
You're gonna go
through with this?
I have to.
You think it's just Hardy?
No, look,
if he's gonna get me,
he's gonna get me.
It doesn't have to be
at this party.
He's gonna have lots of chances.
I'm not gonna hide from him.
Leave it alone.
I can't.
Why?
Because I wanna stand up to him.
Well, forget it.
It's impossible.
Another year, you're gone.
It's better to
swallow pride than blood.
You don't think that.
I don't believe
for a second you think that.
Listen, I'm not
giving into them anymore.
Not for another year,
not for another minute.
I get it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that
I was so tough on you.
Me, too.
You always hurt
the ones you love.
So,
when are you beating the shit
out of Amanda Jones?
Amanda. Amanda!
Oh, sorry.
What time do you want me
to pick you up Saturday?
What, you have to check
with your friends
to see when you can go out?
No, I just, uh...
It's a simple question.
When?
Pick me up anytime you want to.
then... then call me.
Oh, I hate Mexico.
Hi.
I'd much rather go
to the Virgin Islands.
I think we're going to Aspen
over Christmas.
I said, "Hi."
Aspen's okay, but there's really
nothing much to do,
you know, at night.
What is this, you guys?
What are...
Yeah,
it's mostly private parties.
I had a really good time there
last spring.
AMANDA: Shayne!
Spring, it's a completely
different feeling.
There's so many
more college people.
True.
But what's in
the Virgin Islands?
SHAYNE: What,
are you kidding me?
Try a million guys.
So this is it, right?
I'd go anywhere
if I could bag the family
and be on my own.
Thanks.
SHAYNE: I had my parents
almost talked into
letting me go to Ricky's place
in Santa Fe for Thanksgiving.
She's gone.
See you.
See you.
How does it
feel to be carrying
all that cash in your pocket?
Well,
it's a little uncomfortable.
Yeah.
Want me to tell you
one more time
that I think you're crazy?
Nope.
Been hoarding that cash
for years, right?
Yep.
How bad's your dad
gonna ream you?
We won't be able to measure
with existing technology.
He's a miser, right?
No. It's just
real important to him
that I go to college.
'Cause he didn't go.
Exactly.
Hey, I just rag on you
a lot about your parents
and family stuff
'cause I'm jealous.
It's got to feel pretty good
to have someone
looking out for you
like he does.
Sometimes.
He's still gonna
kill you though, right?
Yeah.
Is it her body or her face?
Amanda?
I don't know.
It's, It's everything.
My grandmother told me
when I grew up
I'd have big boobs.
Yeah? What happened?
I don't know.
I guess I just got lucky.
CLIFF: Keith!
Hey, got some
great news today, pal.
You know those T-bills
at the B of A
at 6-and-3/4 percent?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
They're at 7 percent.
That's great.
Know what that means?
Means you're earning
an extra $16 a year per bill.
Wow!
You got your first
year's money, Keith.
Now, all you gotta do
is get off your can
and pick a school
to spend it on.
Yeah. I gotta do that.
Where did that other quarter
of a percent come from?
KEITH: Those are them.
No.
KEITH: Those?
WATTS: Yeah, those.
Solid choice.
That's the ticket.
I think
we've pretty much
covered everything.
All the arrangements
have been made.
KEITH: Yep.
You know what you're gonna say?
Whatever comes in mind.
Ah-ha. You wanna plan
it out a little?
That'll sound false.
I want to be true
to my instincts.
Don't think I'm being weird,
but what if,
what if
she wants you to kiss her?
Well, then I guess
I'm just gonna
have to kiss her.
Amanda Jones is
no minor leaguer
who'll be swept off her feet
at the touch of
your amateur lips.
Thanks.
This babe has
plenty of battle scars.
I think I can handle it.
Great, well,
I just think, maybe,
you should consider
whether or not
you feel you can
deliver a kiss that kills.
What, you think I can't?
If you say you can,
you probably can.
Well, no,
I'm... I'm no expert.
It's cool. I was just
gonna work on it with you,
but if, if you're comfortable
great.
Wait, wait, wait.
How... How do you work on it?
Pretend I'm a girl, okay?
I mean...
Pretend I'm her. Amanda.
I know it's a big stretch
but try it.
Come here.
I didn't mean to scare you.
All right,
what do you do with your hands?
Well, it depends.
No, it doesn't depend.
They go on her hips.
Okay.
Do it.
Look into my eyes.
Come on,
I don't have to do this.
I know. I'm sorry.
All right.
Just grow up a little.
She'll probably do this.
How do you know?
I watch a lot of TV.
Close your eyes.
*
* The minutes that we missed
* The idle lips
that should've kissed *
* Are now gently together
* The first kiss lasts forever *
* She loves me
* She loves me *
What? What?
Lesson's over. You're cool.
You're blushing.
Yeah, right.
The day I blush...
No. No, no.
That was very nice.
You're pretty.
If this is how
you repay a favor,
I don't know
if I'm rich enough
to be your friend.
Oh no, wait, wait.
I didn't mean anything.
I'm... I'm sorry.
Don't be mad, okay?
I'll see you tonight!
*
* Our Amanda Jones
* I said down and down
and down and down *
* She'd look
really lovely at home *
* 'Til somebody gonna
come up and ask her *
* To live happily ever after
* Miss Amanda Jones
* On and on she goes
* Little Miss Amanda Jones
* I said on and on
and on and on *
* Just watch her as she grow
* Don't wanna say it
very obviously *
* But she's losing
her nobility *
* Miss Amanda Jones
* Up and up she goes
* Our Amanda Jones
* I said up and up
and up and up *
* She looks
quite delightfully stoned *
* She's the darling
of the discotheque crowd *
* Of her lineage
she's rightfully proud *
* Miss Amanda Jones
* Round and round she goes
* The world of Amanda Jones
* I said round and round
and round and round *
* The balls
and the dinners and show *
* The little girl
she just wanders about *
* 'Til it's time
for her coming out *
* Miss Amanda Jones
* Round and round and round

* Round and round and round
* Round and round and round *
Dad. What are you doing?
Get dressed.
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna know what's wrong.
Are you in trouble?
No.
Well, were you at
the bank recently?
You withdrew
the college money,
didn't you?
Yeah.
Well, it's going back, pal.
Every last cent
of it's going back.
You don't get this
close to something
and piss it away!
It's not going back
'cause I don't have it.
I spent it.
What did you buy, a car?
Whatever you bought,
you can take back
and you're gonna take it back.
Dad, I can't.
I don't want to.
I don't care what you want.
The money's going back
in the bank and that's final!
Look,
you're not listening to me.
I don't have the money.
I can't get it back.
Look, you had no right
touching that money!
I had every right!
I earned it!
Where's the fucking money,
Keith?
Dad, calm down. Listen to me.
The money is not important here.
You don't know what's important!
You don't know
what the hell
you're talking about!
I do know what the hell
I'm talking about!
You just never listen to me!
You only hear what you want!
Will you listen to me for once?
I'm listening.
I'm not gonna go to college.
The money is gone.
You can't get it back.
It's over. This whole dream.
It's not what I wanted.
It's what you wanted!
I never wanted it!
I just didn't have
the guts to tell you!
You're only 18 years old
for Christ's sake.
Then I'm 19 and I'm 20!
When does my life belong to me?
Dad, listen.
I'm going out
with a girl tonight.
And she is beautiful.
And everybody's
in love with her
and she's going out with me.
Get it?
See,
in the eyes of most people
around here, I'm a nothing.
And, so I don't
start agreeing with them,
I'm gonna go through
with this date.
I just... I wanna show
this girl that
I'm as good as anybody else.
So, what, are you gonna
impress her with money?
Think that's the solution,
Keith?
Dad, didn't you ever
have guys at your school
that didn't fit in?
Yeah, of course.
Yeah?
Well, I'm one of those guys.
I thought things
were going okay for you.
Yeah. Well, I like art.
I work in a gas station.
My best friend is a tomboy.
These things
don't fly too well
in the American high school.
I didn't know about this.
Well,
how could you know about it?
You're my father.
Jesus, Keith, how could you
blow all that money?
Believe me,
there's a good reason
behind all this.
You just got to trust me.
Trust you?
There's a limit, Keith.
How can you put
a limit on trust?
Do you know any father
who would let his kid
do something like this?
No.
So why should I
have to go along with it?
Because you believe in me.
Listen,
I'm gonna replace the money.
Think about it,
you know I will.
I'm not stupid.
I didn't work all this time
just to throw everything away
without thinking about it.
I know what I'm doing.
You sure?
Yeah.
Okay.
But I'm still gonna
ride your ass
about college, Keith,
I'm not giving up on that.
All right.
I've said my piece.
Do me a favor, will you?
Sure.
Stop calling me Clifford.
No problem.
Hi.
Stop sneaking around
listening at people's doors.
Me?
Yeah, you.
Dad, I just came up
to tell Keith
that Watts is downstairs
waiting for him.
Well, don't get in his way.
Did he go apeshit?
No.
Really?
Laura, I'm really
in kind of hurry now.
Keith, I just came up
to wish you luck tonight.
Okay, I have all my friends
crossing their fingers
for you.
Thank you.
He really didn't go apeshit?
He's probably saving it for me.
You want me to lock up for you?
Please. Thanks.
Give me a break.
Would you look at us.
I think you look tremendous.
It's too bad my grandmother
bit the dust.
She'd be very proud.
I'm wearing a bra.
Go get your skag,
and let's roll.
AMANDA: Mom, it's for me.
WOMAN: What time
will you be home?
Early.
Tell Hardy hello for us.
Okay. Bye.
Bye.
Hi.
Hi.
You look different.
Than what?
Than before.
I'm wearing a suit.
So...
Are you ready?
Yeah, yeah,
I'm standing in an open door.
I guess you could say that.
Let's go.
All right.
Wow! Check that out.
Did you steal it?
No. I borrowed it.
See, I figured your ass
was too precious for vinyl.
You're right.
AMANDA: Thank you.
So do you always
bring an extra girl
when you go out?
Well, I like to cover my bets.
That's very cute.
I'll have to remember that.
I'm gonna love this one.
I can feel it already.
*
Is it moving?
Well, what is it?
It's beluga caviar.
It's the most expensive
caviar you can buy.
I thought
you were an uptown girl.
You should know this stuff.
Look,
how this happened is as much
of a mystery to me
as it is to you.
I'm not any more thrilled
about it than you are,
so why don't you just stop
giving me attitude, please?
I'm giving you attitude?
Yeah.
Like on Friday,
pulling that he-man power play
about how I have to
ask my friends for permission.
I didn't appreciate it.
I don't like being
treated like that.
Well, it's true, isn't it?
At least I have friends.
Are you sure?
Look, do you wanna end this
right now?
Oh, no. Hey, hey, relax.
Calm down. Please.
Listen, we ordered.
I don't want to end it.
Enjoy the atmosphere.
Pretend I'm dead.
I wish.
MAN: Throw it out!
Throw it out!
Ladies coming out. All right!
The point is 10.
WATTS: All right,
one-time bet.
One-time bet only.
I'll give you 5-to-1 on it.
BOTH: The 7-to-1?
Does it look like the Sahara?
Do we look Italian?
Look at my face.
I don't need this.
I got action...
Where you going?
Sit, sit.
Conference. Conference.
What do you say?
No way. To win big
you got to do what?
Lose.
Lose big. Lose big.
That's right.
What are we doing now?
ALL: We're losing big.
Double nickels.
Ten the hard way.
Mess with the bull,
you get the horns.
You know what I'm saying?
WAITER: Bon appetit.
Very uptown.
Hey, you're smiling.
I'm sorry.
No, no. Don't apologize.
It's nice.
You have a lovely smile.
You should smile more often.
Okay.
Whenever I try not to smile,
I smile more.
I'll get the door.
No, I got it.
Sorry I wasn't
more on the ball.
I was comatose.
Here, I brought you
something to eat.
A gift? For me?
Yeah.
Yeah, I thought
you might be hungry.
Gee, thanks.
Eating and driving is as handy
as skiing and doing your taxes.
Well, maybe you can eat
at the next stop.
Could I book time
to take a leak?
What's your problem?
Nothing.
Excuse me a minute, please.
Listen,
you volunteered to do this.
I was all prepared to drive
and you said, "No, no,
I'll drive so you guys
can talk." Remember?
It was this morning, moron,
of course I remember.
So why are you giving me shit?
Let's go.
If my dinner reeks,
let me know,
I'll put it in the trunk.
It's fine, really.
Well then, we're off.
*
* I go crazy
* When I'm without you
Pardon me.
No problem.
Good.
* What have I done today
* Just sat and watched
the jets fly over *
* A car goes by
and the sun goes down *
Thank you.
Break his heart,
I break your face.
What are we doing here?
It's an art museum.
But what are we doing here?
You don't like art?
I do like art.
It's just that, isn't it closed?
That doesn't mean
we can't go in.
Oh.
Okay.
Hello.
We've been waiting for you
a long, long time, my pop and I.
Come on in. Right this way.
Gimme five over here, pal.
There you go.
Amanda, Duncan.
Nice to meet you, Amanda.
And Ice.
No monkey business, hey?
Dad, please, freeze it.
Okay? I told you before,
it's gonna be all fine.
God, those are nice legs, man.
If I lose my job
because of this
you're in the dumper, Duncan.
Absolutely, Pop, absolutely.
Thanks a lot.
Just remember,
anything for a pal, okay?
*
Have you ever been here before?
Yeah.
Sixth grade.
I don't remember.
I come here all the time.
I've never been here
at night, though.
This place is my church.
I can come here
and what anybody says
about me doesn't matter.
I have to come back here
when I can spend more time.
We have all night.
There's one in here
that I'd like to show you.
AMANDA:
So what do you see in me?
Be honest.
KEITH: What do you see in me?
You first.
I don't think anybody
ever thought
anything about me
other than I look good
next to him.
And I went along with it
because I'd rather be
next to somebody
for the wrong reasons
than alone for the right ones.
I'd rather be right.
Can't stand being alone.
Nobody can stand being alone.
The minute you stop thinking
there's someone
out there for you
it's over, isn't it?
Isn't it?
I don't know.
Listen, I've been waiting
a long time,
and I still don't have it,
but I will.
What?
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
It's not funny.
I know you know
what I'm talking about.
I... I don't.
This.
Tonight was a joke.
I was set up.
You used me, right?
You think I used you?
Didn't you?
I don't know. In a way.
In a way?
Amanda, there's only one way
you use someone.
You either do or you don't.
And you didn't use me?
God, you hypocrite.
What's hanging
in that museum, huh?
My soul? No, it's my face.
You're using me
to pay back every guy
with more money
and more power than you.
Paint it any color you want.
It's still you using me.
You're right.
I did use you.
For all those reasons.
I'm sorry.
Can we call it even?
We're even.
This is for you.
What is it?
It's my future.
In this box is my future,
every cent I've ever earned.
It's for you.
I can't take these.
You have to.
I know you liked them.
I saw you wearing Shayne's,
remember?
This is insane.
It doesn't make any sense.
You shouldn't have
to borrow anything.
You're too good for that.
Why are you crying?
I feel so terrible
for what I've been doing.
I hate, I hate feeling ashamed.
I hate where I'm from.
I hate watching my friends
get everything
their hearts desire.
I gave in to that hatred
and I turned on
what I believed in.
I didn't have to.
You didn't.
So you won't do it again.
You don't have to.
Ever.
What now?
Hardy's house.
Have you forgotten something?
He wants to beat
the crap out of you.
It's for real, Keith.
I know.
Well, if you wanna do that,
drive yourself.
I have to face him
sooner or later.
It's not just Hardy.
It's his friends.
I can handle it.
I could beat
the crap out of you.
You won't last six seconds.
I know what I'm doing.
Don't go overboard, studly.
Let's go.
WATTS: You don't have to
do this, you know.
Yeah, I do.
Okay. I'll be here.
Thanks.

* So lonely
Guess what?
Amanda brought him.
Welcome.
I'm glad you could come by.
It's getting late,
I was worried you were
gonna disappoint us.
So did you have a good time?
Yeah.
Yeah.
She's deceptively innocent,
isn't she?
Clean and nice on the outside.
Did she do you?
See, the one thing
that I'm glad about
is that you get her used.
Back off, man!
BOY: Come on, Keith!
That was not very smart, friend.
I don't even care about you.
She's the trash.
You're just a fool.
Take him outside
and kick the shit out of him.
Why don't you take me outside?
What?
I said, why don't you
take me outside?
I don't play that way.
I would love to, but you see,
I am the host here.
I have guests.
I said, take him outside, okay?
Hardy, you don't wanna do this.
HARDY: Oh, really?
Yeah, you said yourself,
I'm the trash.
I got him into this.
Why don't you just
deal with me, huh?
That's very touching,
standing up
for your new man.
I like that.
Look, let him go.
Why don't you do
something right
for once in your life?
Amanda, forget it.
It's worthless.
You can't talk to him.
What do you want?
You know what I want.
Okay.
You want me back, I'm back.
Come on. It's not that easy.
You're gonna
have to convince me.
I want you to beg.
Let him go.
Come on,
you're a beggar. Beg.
Bastard.
You're gonna have to beg.
I don't think
that's gonna be necessary.
You know, I didn't know
Jenns lived in a henhouse.
Did you know that?
Must be a henhouse.
'Cause I don't see nothing
but chicken shit.
I don't want any trouble
with you, all right?
My parents are gonna be home
in a little while.
You leave now
and we'll forget everything.
All right, now.
Let's just cut the bullshit,
all right? Please?
I'm here to wipe
the floor with your ass,
and you know it.
And everybody knows it.
And you deserve it.
And I think it's safe to say
that this party
is about to become
a historical fact.
Wait, wait. Duncan,
let me talk to him.
Okay.
Look, I'm perfectly
willing to forget this.
Okay? I see no reason
in carrying this on
any longer.
It was a joke.
It's gone too far.
It's over, okay?
KEITH: You want the truth?
You want the plain truth?
You're over.
* So lonely
Are you just gonna leave?
There isn't anything
I can do to him
he hasn't already
done to himself.
Come on.
Wish I could live with that.
DUNCAN: Good move, Amanda.
I approve.
KEITH: Thanks again, Duncan.
DUNCAN: No problem,
no problem.
You guys go along, okay?
We're just gonna
stick around here,
try to crank up this party
to a nice, respectable level.
Okay?
Okay.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna mess him up.
I'm not even gonna touch him.
I'm just gonna make him cry
just a little bit by
just looking at him.
Okay. Good night.
* Don't find nothing
All right.
Let's cut the bullshit.
We're gonna have some fun.
We're gonna have some fun!
All right, guys,
these girls have been
looking at you like
I don't know what.
All right,
now we're ready to party.
What a beautiful woman
right here.
She is dying for you.
Remind me never to
get you mad at me.
Did you see
the look on his face?
* SO LONELY *
Nice move.
I saw it from out here.
Well, uh,
why don't you guys run along?
I'm gonna walk.
My butt's asleep
from sitting all night.
I'm sorry if I misjudged you.
That's okay.
Keys are in the car.
Remember how I said
I'd rather be with someone
for the wrong reasons
than alone for the right ones?
I'd rather be right.
It's gonna feel good
to stand on my own.
Here.
In your heart
you wanted to give these
to somebody else.
Go.
Go on.
Watts!
Watts!
Watts.
Watts.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Yeah, well, you're stupid.
I always knew you were stupid.
Why didn't you tell me?
You never asked.
I wanted these.
I really wanted them.
They're yours.
You knew
you were gonna get these.
No, I didn't.
I hoped, but I didn't know.
You knew.
I had a feeling.
Well, how do they look?
You look good wearing my future.
