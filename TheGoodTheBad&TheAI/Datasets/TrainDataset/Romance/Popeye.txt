Sweethaven.
You just dock?
I have.
Uh-huh.
There'll be 25 cents
docking tax.
What for?
Where's your seacraft?
It ain't no seacraft.
It's me dinghy,
and it's under the wharf.
Aha. Ah, huh.
This your goods?
They is.
Yeah?
You're new in town,
right?
:
You call this a town?
Yeah.
Well, first of all,
there's 17 cents
new-in-town tax.
Then there's 45 cents
rowboat-under-the-wharf tax,
and one dollar leaving-your-
junk-lying-around-the-wharf tax.
So, all together,
you owe the Commodore
$1.87.
Ah, who's this Commodore?
That the nature of a question?
There's a nickel question tax.
Oh, forget it.
I see what you're up to here.
Here we go.
Exact change, please.
I'm an exact-change
taxman.
Oh. Mmm. Here's a dollar.
Here's a red cent.
Here's a franc.
A peso.
Here's a guilder.
Oh, sorry I'm taking
your time.
There's a dime;
there we go.
There's one quarter.
Curiosity tax.
Hey, I paid me tax.
Oh, tax this, tax that.
Ooh, my nightmare don't...
Mmm, I gets disgustipated.
"Have you paid your tax?"
MAN 1:
I got it, I got it.
MAN 2:
No, I-I got it.
MAN 3:
I got it, I got it.
MAN 4:
Don't worry, I got it.
POPEYE:
Holy cow.
Looks like me old pipe.
Wonder what it's doing here?
What a coinkydink.
Hey! What is this?
This ain't
the orchestra pit.
Oh, lookit there.
Nobody seems to care...
You've got so much
to bear, ma'am.
Can I...?
Blow me down!
That's it, that...!
Oh, it's the wind
and air...
Just try to double dare
to... blow me down.
PARROT:
Awk! Wait for me!
Hello, there, mate.
Maybe, uh...
Ah, blow me down.
It's no bother, but...
Look over there--
stranger's coming.
You'd rather not, huh?
Well, that's easy to see.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Wherever I go...
Ooh, nice-looking knees,
it does it for me.
Bad news!
Bad, bad, bad news.
POPEYE:
Hmm, I don't believe that.
What a lovely day...
Well, it's still
a perfect day, but...
Oh, maybe ma'am,
you would like to...
Blow me down
again, there.
It's a lovely place
Think I'd like
to stay, but...
Stranger in town.
Blow me down.
Somebody roll into town?
Blow me down--
local glum club.
It's friendly here...
A little scary, too.
I think I'll spend a year,
Or two, maybe thr...
Whoa, tut-tut-tut.
I yam what I yam,
wherever I go
I came from the sea...
Should've got me number,
but no one's looking it up,
ain't it?
Oh...
Good day.
Good day.
I hate you to pieces!
Kind of a greasy good day,
but that's all right.
Bunch of carrotsk?
No, no.
You ain't got no carrotsk?
What are those, prunes?
Phooey on carrots!
Take broccoli.
I am in the mood
for carrotsk.
I need me vitamins.
Phooey on carrots!
Take spinach!
If I wants spinach,
I'll axk you for spinach.
So, why
you didn't say so?
For you, each a dollar.
How much is
the broccoli?
Nickel, maybe dime.
And the spinach?
Dime, maybe quarter.
Then how come
carrotsk is a dollar?
Dollar fifty.
You buy what I don't feel
like selling,
it'll cost you $2.
All right, here you go.
Uh-uh-uh-uh!
Hey, deadbeat,
this is a nickel.
I pays what I
feels like paying.
You're not up to
no good, are you?
'Cause if you are,
there's a 50-cent up-to-no-good tax.
Come here! Come back!
Seems like everywhere
Lots of people here
Try to blow me down...
Unlike the clothes I wear
I haven't...
Careful, there.
What blew him into town?
Oh, the short arm of the law,
huh?
Blow me down
Blow me down...
Ow!
Hey, come ba... hey, hey-- ah!
Uh, are you the piano tuner
or the man with the party favor?
You got a room for renk?
What for what?
Renk, renk-- your
sign says you got a room for renk.
Oh, my stars
and gardens!
My mind
was a million miles away.
Come in before you catch
your death of mud.
"Mud."
"Oyls." That explains it.
She's down a quart.
Scums-- I'll find you.
Come on, come on!
Mmm. Don't make them
like they used to.
Oh, come on.
Oh!
I'm sorry, Mother,
but it's ugly.
I ask you, have you ever
seen anything so ugly?
I won't be engaged
in this hat.
I heard that.
Don't think I didn't hear that.
Oh...
She owes me an apology.
Oh... ugly.
There's nothing
left to say.
What do you think?
I think
it's up to you, dear.
Well, what do
you think? Ugly.
I think it's a conspiracy.
Oh...
Why would they manufacture
deliberate ugliness
unless they wanted me
to look ugly?
If we find that out,
we find out everything.
There's a stranger
in t... um... ooh...
Oh...
I can't get engaged.
You'll have to tell
Bluto; I can't.
We'll have to
cancel the party
tomorrow night.
It's not my fault
that it's so ugly.
What are you doing
listening in on
a private conversation
between me
and my mother?
I have a good mind to have
my father call a policeman.
Olive, will you show
Mister... Mister...?
Oh. Popeye, ma'am.
...Mr. Eye
the spare room?
Just Popeye, ma'am.
Go upstairs, Mr. Eye.
Olive will show you the room.
:
Thanks.
:
Some kind of asylum here.
Show me a room.
Show me some
courtesy
might be nice.
I don't see why
I have to do anything
on the day
before my engagement party
when nothing's ready,
especially me.
And what kind of name is that,
anyway-- Popeye?
Pretty strange.
What kind of name is Olive Oyl?
Sounds like
some kind of lubricants.
Thank you very
much, ma'am.
Don't look in that room;
that's my room.
Meant no
disrespect there.
Ugly, huh?
You owe me an apology.
What?
Wonder who shoved
a feather in his ear?
What'd you say?
Sure is nice weather
you have here.
Your name really Olives?
So what?
Olives Oyl?
You don't look
Greek to me.
So, you're short.
Or are you just passing
yourself off as short?
Can I see me room now?
Ooh, as if I cared.
Let me give you
a hand there.
Maybe it needs
a little oil.
Oh!
Oh, oh...
Nice-looking room.
Never seen a room done
in early demolish-kin before,
but this'll do for me.
Careful how you treat that bed.
Nothing goes
on this bed.
Sorry, ma'am, it's just some...
Watch that lamp!
:
Let me give you some assistance.
Here, give me your hand.
There, that's it.
Yeah, here we go.
Oh, you're in first.
Is that... oh...
Boy, is it hot in here.
I still respect you.
Ooh!
Me bad eye, didn't see that.
Hmph!
Thanks for your help.
Uh, Miss Oyl, maybe...
WOMAN:
Don't forget to put the cat out, dear.
MAN:
We don't have a cat.
Eau de toilette.
Yeah, eau de toilette.
:
Yeah.
COLE:
How do you like that?
Gold is up 20 cents,
two dollars an ounce.
Out of my kitchen,
Mr. Wimpy.
CASTOR:
I knew it, I knew it, see...
You wait for
the supper gong.
I could've made
a fortune on Billings
if Bluto would've let me go
directly to the Commodore.
He's so jealous
of me, that Bluto.
Well, who
wouldn't be?
COLE:
Me, I'm not jealous of Castor.
He's my son.
Man jealous
of his own son.
You owe me an apology.
I didn't mean you.
CASTOR:
Never lets me go to the Commodore.
Commodore is a paragon
of sagacity.
If ever I could
put in a good word...
"Shut up" is the word.
"Pass" is another word
that Wimpy...
You don't pass.
He should be
killed to death.
COLE:
It says here the Commodore's taxing salt again.
Don't look as good as I smell,
but too late now.
:
Got to go.
Oh, Mr. Eye,
have you met-- uh, Pop?
Mr. Wimpy,
my son Castor,
Mr. Geezil,
my husband Cole.
We're all one big
happy family here.
Hmph!
Although not really.
I mean, well, Mr. Geezil
and Mr. Wimpy are, um...
Me, I'm family.
Well, you're
my husband.
You owe me an apology.
OLIVE:
Well, I can't find anything.
What are you
looking for, Olive?
A glass.
Oh, uh, here's a glass.
That's a short, fat, ugly glass.
I want a tall, pretty,
slender glass.
They're all broken.
I could've made
a fortune in fish futures...
Fish?
but I'd have to dip into capital.
Fish futures smell.
What kind of glass
do you want, Olive?
A wine glass
or a brandy glass,
or a water glass?
Oh, not a thing--
I don't want a thing.
Real appetizing.
I want a fork.
Right beside
your plate.
If it was a knife,
it would cut you.
And a knife.
Will you sit down?
Why don't I have a knife?
And a nice dress?
You owe me
an apology.
Passing fish,
please.
Fish, excellent idea, Miss Oyl.
I would suggest before
matrimony, fish.
Fish before
matrimony.
Ooh, that does look good, there.
Wish I had a plate though.
...because four times
engaged is three times much.
Oh, he can't talk me
out of anything; I'm not a child.
I'll say you're
not a child.
Who says I'm not a child?
You said you're not a child
and I agreed with you,
that's who.
Who asked you
to agree with me?
Well, no one can stop me
from agreeing with you
if I want to.
I can.
Quarreling at
my table.
You both owe me
an apology.
Sorry, Pop.
What?
Please pass the shrimp,
chicken and meatballs.
Well, I don't know.
Captain Bluto has
the patience of Job.
Or is it job?
Certainly got
a very good job, Job.
And he needs a lot of patience.
Why, he runs this town
for the Commodore
while he's away.
And the Commodore's always away.
As a matter of fact,
I've never seen him.
Have you, Cole?
What?
I'd never let a girl
break my engagement.
I'd break her nose before
she broke my engagement.
And you better not try on me
what you pulled on Bluto,
because I'm no pushover.
You owe your
sister an apology.
Will you stop fidgeting?
Finishing touch here.
OLIVE:
Oh, this knife won't cut.
Here, take mine.
Not since I was child
have we had a sharp knife
in this house.
COLE:
You owe me an apology.
You don't like
our knives.
Bluto's rich, he can buy you
plenty of knives.
Ooh, I hate this table,
it's ugly.
I'm the only one with
nerve enough to tell the truth about it.
:
Well, then, why don't you let Bluto the pushover
buy you a new table?
Am I right, Pop?
Right.
I'm right, right?
You're right.
Right.
WIMPY:
Nothing left?
Oh... Bluto, Bluto, Bluto.
Everyone takes advantage
of my poor Bluto.
Get a new... glass,
a new knife.
Now they want a table.
Well, hmph!
That's why I always
have to break off
our engagement--
to stop you all
from taking advantage
of the sweetest,
most humble man
on the face of this Earth!
Hmph.
Mmm.
You make me sick.
Never good to be too full,
I guess.
:
It's 9:00!
Curfew!
Lights... out!
WOMAN :
You can have a kiss now.
Oh!
Poppa.
Pretty soon you and me are going
to be together again, huh?
Yeah.
Besides, next Wednesday's
our annual-versity.
Yeah?
Stay alive.
That's all I'm axskin you.
Good night, Poppa.
Aw...
There.
Sweep, sweep,
sweep, sweep.
Sweep, sweep...
Hey-up!
Ah... whoop!
Eee-oh!
Everything
is food, food, food
Everything
is meat, meat, meat
Once it lived
on an ani-mule
I would gladly pay you Tuesday
For a hamburger today
Everything
is fast-food chains
From your lemon
to your sugarcane
It is food
Did you order a hamburger?
Yeah, I ordered
a hamburger.
That's what I got,
a hamburger.
No, I beg to disagree.
Rough House,
a genuine hamburger
for the gentleman.
I'm buying.
Hey, thanks.
ROUGH HOUSE:
Who's paying?
I'm buying, he's paying.
TAXMAN:
A nickel hamburger tax?
I'd refuse to pay
if I were you.
A shocking abuse of power.
TAXMAN:
Rough House!
One hamburger-chiseler's tax.
I would gladly
pay you Tuesday
What kind mooch is this?
For a hamburger today
MEN:
Hey, hey, hey, Laverne!
Give us a smooch!
I really need someone
to kind of talk to,
'cause I thought everybody
in this town might be deef.
Huh, what's that?
Huh? Oh.
You know, jusk why
I'm here is...
I'm looking for me pap.
Yeah, oh...
I've searched
the seven seas for him,
and I haven't
found him yet.
I was only two years old,
me own pap left me.
I was just a mere infink.
Me own pap...
Pipe down, will ya?
Me own pap ditches me.
I'm a very tolerant man,
except when it comes
to holding a grudge.
I never thought
I'd forgive me paps,
but about
seven years ago,
I ships out on this boat,
:
That's a boat. Yeah.
Just off the coast
of Guam.
It breaks up
on this typhoon,
and I'm stuck on
this raft for 45 days
without food or waters.
But after all
this time on this raft,
this visiktation
comes to me.
Looks just like me mother,
rest her soul.
And it says,
"Your pap is still alive."
Excuse me.
So, when I was
finally rescued,
I figured out that I got
to forgive me paps, you know?
Uh, you see,
I'm only afeared
that he might be dead,
and never realize what a
fine figure of an orphink
I turned out to be.
You sure got
a nice-looking face there,
One-Eye.
One-Eye?
I've seen better arms
on a baboon.
You're a slimy...
Yeah, you want to
know why you're so "lonescome,"
go take a look
at that mirror.
You know, if there's
one thing I ain't got,
it's a sense ka humor.
Where did you get that,
uh,
Yeah? Got an olive
caught in your throat?
Well, yeah, well,
I'll get back to you.
Pappy.
His Dada.
No. I want
my Dada.
Hey, if I were
your daddy,
I'd ship
out, too.
Yeah. You're
too dumb-looking
to leave on
a doorstep.
Hey, runt...
I'll bet your
pappy...
is as ugly
as you are.
Another thing I got...
is a sensk
of humiligration.
Now, uh, maybe you swabs can,
uh, pool your intelligence
and sees that I'm asking you
for an apologiky.
Hey, Butch,
why don't you
give daddy's boy
an apology?
With pleasure,
Spike.
The little one-eyed rat
wants an apology.
Well, I would like
to offer my most sincere
and hum-felt apologies.
You got it.
That's so low...
picking on innocents.
You apologize?
Do you apologize?
I-I apologize.
Rosie, get my hat.
I think
it's time we leave. I...
back to the dairy...
Apologize.
For what?
All these innocents.
This is a smorgasbord
of violence.
Well, that's everybody.
Everybody's apologized.
Yeah,
everybody's really sorry.
Oh, everybody's
really,
really sorry.
Now it's your turn
to be sorry.
MAN:
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but enough is enough.
Hey.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Anybody else want
to apologygy?
All in a day's fun, ain't it?
I dare you.
Nobody home?
There you go.
Sorry about that.
No. Keep the change.
Remember, my dear,
tonight it's my
turn to be tall.
Oh.
MAN:
Very nice party.
I can't help
but feel sad, though.
Chico?
This is a sad day
for me.
Chico, hand these things out.
It's one of the saddest days
of my life.
Flowers.
I forgot the flowers.
Yup.
Oh, disillusionkand.
Oh, look at that.
Oh, me dress blues.
This is Castor's
favorite color.
Oh, you
and Castor.
Oh, phooey.
WOMAN:
Oh, hello there, Cousin.
We're just waiting
for Captain Bluto.
Oh, I can't tell you
how happy this makes me
to attend Miss Oyl's parties.
Uh, nice-looking furs there.
Hmm?
Oh.
Boy, uh, I don't know
when I've had this much fun
and still been conskious.
Well... I better be on me way.
Oh, reservoir.
Not really as nice as ours.
But he's so big.
WOMAN:
I really...
MAN:
Typical smutty sailor comment.
WOMAN:
Sailor....
Oh, I don't want
to go to no party.
Well, that's good,
'cause you ain't invited.
Who says I ain't invited?
I says.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
I'm you.
Don't drain your sense
of dignity... is that it?
Nah.
WOMAN:
WOMEN:
OLIVE:
WOMEN:
Distinguishingly
ugly.
Bluto's special.
ALL:
Oh, he's special, all right.
Especially ugly.
He's tall
Good-looking
And he's large
He's large
Large
Tall
Large...
Good morning,
Captain Bluto.
:
I... I mean...
Good evening,
Captain Bluto.
I mean...
And he's mine
Not a mandolin
He's an accordion
I have to squeeze him
each night to keep him warm
Oh, boy
He's virile
And he's strong
He's strong
Uh...
Sounds like Fluto.
Bluto.
Bluto.
At your
services, sir.
There's a good picture
in the paper this week.
A lovely
present for you
down at the pawn
shop, Captain Bluto.
I would have
brought it, but it was too late.
Anytime you want
me to come by
and stain up the boat,
Captain Bluto.
Mother!
He's got money and respect
He's better than the rest
He may not be the best
But he's large
And he's mine...
ALL:
She can have him.
Yeah.
She loves me.
MAN:
Of course she does.
She don't
love me.
Oh, no.
She'll marry me.
Large
Large
Mine
Mine
She  marry me.
Oh.
She will.
She won't.
It may seem funny,
but it's not
I'm thankful
For what I've got
It may not be a lot
But he's large.
She will.
Yes, yes.
She...
Faulty flower...
C-Captain Bluto.
WOMEN:
Mrs. Oyl, Olive's...
Olive's what?
WOMEN:
Olive's...
...getting ready.
Good.
Now, where were we?
Uh, she won't
marry you, she...
She will!
Oh, my word!
Son-in-law.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Ah! Ooh.
NANA:
Olive!
MAN:
Marvelous, marvelous.
No place to go.
Can't go to no party
without an invite.
Whoo!
Ho, ho, ho, whoa.
Whoo! Ooh.
Miss Oyl.
Oh...
You scared the
wits out of me.
Yeah, I almost knocked 'em
out of you, too.
Sorry I did that
to you. What right do you have
to lurk here in the dark
in the middle of the night
and scare the wits
out of a person?
I wasn't.
I was just, uh, kind of, uh...
Oh, oh.
How's your party going,
Miss Oyl?
Oh, that's a
dumb question. Yeah.
Where do you think I'm headed
right this minute?
Um... well, uh,
mmm, that way, I think.
Out of town.
I am not headed
out of town. Oh.
Don't you see which
direction I'm facing?
You're going,
now you're facing... Oh, ooh, whoa.
Now you're facing east.
Oh.
Maybe a little southwest.
Place your bets. Oh. Oh!
You need some help
with your bags there, Miss Oyl?
Ooh, oh, no.
I didn't touch ya.
I didn't mean
to hurt ya.
Thank you.
Oh, you do.
Oh.
Oh.
No, that's
the wrong way.
Oh.
No, that's
the wrong way.
I want to go...
Oh...
Oh, oh...
Whoo! Oh. Oh, oh.
Oh!
Oh, oh...
Oh...
That way.
That'll be 50 cents
impersonating-a-
traffic-cop tax.
What?
Oh.
I'm sorry, Miss Oyl.
Didn't recognize you
from the back.
It won't happen again.
How come Miss Oyl
don't have to pay no taxes?
TAXMAN:
That's ten cents question tax.
But... I'll let you off this time
since you're
with Miss Oyl.
Good night, Miss Oyl.
Well, how come being
with Miss Oyl
means I don't have
to pay no...
...taxes?
Well, I don't know
what you're talking about.
Here's a nice cup of tea
for you, Captain Bluto,
while you're waiting.
Where's Olive?
Olive?
You think everyone pays taxes
but me and my family,
don't you? Mm-hmm.
Well, you couldn't be
more wrong.
If I'm wrong, why
am I in the right?
You think it's because
I'm engaged to Bluto
and Bluto runs the town
for the Commodore
so we get special favors.
Well, it's a lie. Hmm.
Olive!
Bluto is kind and generous
and likes to do things
for his loved ones.
And you want me to
hurt his feelings.
Well, phooey on you.
Hmm. You don't even care
enough about me or my family
to be at my engagement party.
And what are you doing here
in Sweethaven anyway, hmm?
Well, I'm-I'm looking
for me pap.
Mmm.
Yeah.
Oh, well, if that's
true, then where is he?
Well, yeah, um, got me there.
I don't really know.
I... I got this sense
that he's here though,
you know?
Oh, well, all right,
I'll wait. Hmm.
Anyway, there are too
many guests as it is.
Half of them I hate.
One thing I remember
about me pap
was that he always used
to throw me up in the air.
But he'd never be there
when I come down, you know.
Heh, heh, heh.
Mmm.
Boy, he had a sense
ka humor, didn't he?
Yeah, that was me pap.
I remember that
time he gave me
an electric eel as a toy.
:
Eep!
Yeah, that was fun.
Or he'd rock me
in my cradle
And then he'd say, "One
day, you'll be a sailor."
That...
that's what I am today.
Yeah. Sometimes, he'd
bounce me on his knee.
Most of the time
he'd miss, though
'cause he couldn't see
too well with one eye.
Oh, me pap, yeah.
Well, I'm not waiting
any longer. Hmm.
Oh, sorry, Miss Oyl.
I was philoscofying.
Mm-hmm.
...between us, got kind of
derailed and...
Oh, yeah, long time waiting.
Wait a while..
What are you doing
with that basket?
Well, I-I'm carrying it.
It's your basket, ain't it?
It is not my basket.
Somebody has deliberately
painted that basket
to look like my basket.
My basket was clean
and beautiful
and this basket is ugly.
Rattlesnake!
Miss Oyl, we should at least
have dinner first,
or something.
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!
Oh, rattlesnake!
Ooh! Oh, oh, oh!
Rattlesnakes?
Where is it, Miss Oyl?
Where is it?
Oh, oh,
rattlesnake, oh!
Don't worry, Miss Oyl,
I've handled
vermins before.

Bye, Mom.
Ow!
Worry, worry, worry.

Oh, the main thing is

Oh, you're gone now.
You're really a dizzy dame.
Oh, I asked Swee'pea,
and he told me.
Isn't that so?
What's this here?
See, I asked Swee'pea,
"Swee'pea, will
Popeye be killed?"
Uh-uh.
No?
So then I asked,
"Swee'pea, will Popeye
be seriously maimed?"
No?
That's two for two.
That could happen
to anybody, ya know.
So then I queried,
"Swee'pea,
will Popeye
actually survive?"
POPEYE:
Yeah, I survived. Yeah, yeah.
OLIVE:
"What? You mean he'll win?"
Oh!
That's-that's a neat trick.
Oh-ho, me infant

More interested in talking

Uh, Popeye?
POPEYE:
Yeah?
WIMPY:
He's an adorable little fellow.
And he's a psychic, too.
Ain't that the truth.
WIMPY:
But he looks a little peaked to me.
He needs some air.
Air? That's all
we have here is air.
WIMPY:
With your permission, Popeye,
I'll... take him
for a little walk.
Well, Wimpy, why not?
I mean, you're

You're his Uncle Wimp.
Yeah, that's it.

he's never had a home
He needs me, he needs me,
he needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
For once, for once in life
I finally felt
that someone needed me
And if it turns out real
Then love can turn the wheel
Because he needs me,
he needs me
He needs me, he needs me,
he needs me, he needs me
Da-da, da, da, da, da,

It wasn't my fault.
The whole country

And he wouldn't
eat his spinach.
That was Coolidge, Poppa.
His poppa going hungry.
Going off to steal.
Stealing what?
BOTH:
Spinach.
So his ungrate
son could grow up big and strong.

You know what I done

Oh, yeah? Well,

You command this privy,
and I'll commands

You ain't me fadder.
Me fadder was tall

Talking to your
poor old fadder like that.
You disobedient brat.
You're spoiled--
that's what you are-- spoiled.
Children. Children. Kids.
Eh, phooey!
Phooey!
Nothing but heartache,
heartache, sadness, and miserky.
And a bad time, once in a while,
when you try to give them a
bath, and they don't want it.
And another bad time
when you want to do something
that you  want to do,
but all they want to do
is not what you want to do.
Bless their little hearts.
If they were
really made out of gold,
I could make me a fortune.
I could've
made us a fortune. Kids!
That's what they gonna do.
Lead you to ruin.
They cry at you
when they're young,
they yell at you
when they're older,
they borrow from yous
when they're middle-aged,
and they leave you
alone to die...
without even paying you back!
Children. Phooey!
and what do you
get back in return?
You gets nothing!
Catch him like
a big, fat lobster.
Why, they're just smaller
versions of us, you know.
Well, I'm not
so crazy about me in the first place.
So why do I want
one of them?
Ah, children.
Little children.
You'll pour
your heart out to them,
you give them
everything they want,
give them candy,
and a lot of toys,
and what do you get back?
You get a lot of noise.
:
Nah-nah-nah-nah, nah, nah.
My poppa's a mean old man!
I'm through with children.
I'm through with kids.
There ain't nothing
I'm never gonna do about it.

Come on, haul ass,

In a good position, that's it.
POPEYE:
What are you doing?
You can't fire that thing.
There's women and infants

PAPPY:
You stop worrying.
All I'm gonna do
is fire a warning shot
right across

Don't you thinks

A little short?

Oh, shit!
Now, listen, kid,

OLIVE:

Okay, kid,
