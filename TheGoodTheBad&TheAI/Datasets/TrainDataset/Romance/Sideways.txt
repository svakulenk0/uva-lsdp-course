-
-
Oh, fuck.
-
-
- Uh, yeah?
- Miles, can you move your car, please?
- Why?
- Because the roofers gotta get the truck in.
- You didn't park too good. Okay?
- Yeah. All right.
Hold on.
Sorry. Sorry, gentlemen.
Sorry.
Oh, fuck me!
I know I said
I would be there by noon...
but, uh, there's all of this work
going on at my building...
and it's just a total nightmare.
I had a bunch of stuff
I had to deal with this morning...
but I'm on my way.
I'm out the door right now.
-  Hi, Simon.
-  Hey, Miles.
- Triple espresso, please?
- For here?
Uh, no, actually.
I'm running late. Make it to go.
And give me a New York Times
and a spinach croissant.
Thank you.
- Ah!
- Well, hello!
- Hello, Mrs. Erganian. How are you?
- Come on in.
- Thank you. Is Jack still here?
- Yes.
Shot on the way to the 1 1 8.
Look what the cat dragged.
- Hi, everybody. Sorry.
- Hey.
Somebody finally arrived.
You finally got here. Mr. Prompt.
- Oh, remember my kids? Alex, Helen?
- Hi. How are you?
We were thinking maybe you went
the wrong way,you went to Tijuana...
- Right.
- and they don't let you back.
- Yes! Yes!
-  Daddy!
- I had to bribe them.
-  Hey, Miles.
Hey. How are you, Christine?
-
- Yeah, the freeway was unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
It was bumper-to-bumper the whole way.
People getting an early start
on the weekend, I guess.
Granted, I got a late start, but--
Well, we're just glad you made it.
Christine, why don't you
ask Miles about the cake?
- Oh, good idea. Come with me.
- What's this?
We don't really have time for that,
'cause we gotta hit the road.
-  Oh, come on.!
It's just gonna take a second.!
- Yeah.
Mmm.
Jack tells us you are publishing a book.
Congratulations.
- Uh--
- Yes, congratulations.
Yes, well, uh,
it's not exactly finalized yet.
- So-- There has been some interest, and--
- Your friend is modest.
Oh, come on, Miles.
Don't be so modest. Indulge them.
- Don't make me out to be a liar.
- What is the subject of your book?
- Nonfiction?
- Uh, no. It's-- It's a novel.
- Fiction. Yes.
- Oh.
Although there is quite a bit
from my own life...
so I suppose that, technically,
some of it is nonfiction.
Good. I like nonfiction.
There is so much to know
about this world.
I think you read something somebody
just invented it, waste of time.
That's an interesting perspective.
- So, which one do you like better?
- Oh, well, I like them both.
But, um, if pressed, I would have to say
that I prefer the dark.
-
-  Told ya.!
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Where the fuck were you, man? Huh?
I was dying in there.
- We're supposed to be
a hundred miles away by now.
- I can't help the traffic.
Oh, come on. You're fucking hungover.
You know you are.
Okay, there was
a tasting last night, yes.
But I wanted to get us something nice
for the ride up. Check out the box.
Why did you tell them
that my novel was being published?
- 'Cause you said you had it all lined up.
- No, I didn't. No. No.
What I said was that there was
some interest at Conundrum.
- Yeah. Conundrum.
- And that one of the editors
was passing it to a senior editor.
Sounds pretty good to me.
Sounds like you're in.
No. It's a long shot.
Besides, Conundrum,
it's just a small specialty press.
I'm not gonna get my hopes up.
You know? I've stopped caring.
The hell with it.
I have stopped caring.
It sounds like it's gonna happen this time.
I mean, I can feel it.
I think this is the one. Huh?
I'm really proud of you, man.
- Don't open that now. It's warm.
- Why not?
Jack, that is a 1992 Byron.
It's really rare. Okay?
- I've been saving it. Don't--
- All right. I won't open it.
-
-Jack!
-
- Half of it gone.
Hey, shut up. Okay?
Here's to a great week.
- Come on.
-
Yes. Absolutely.
Despite your crass behavior...
I'm actually glad
we're getting this time together.
Yeah. Me too.
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.
- Was beginning to think
it was never gonna happen.
- Man! That's tasty!
That's 1 00% pinot noir.
Single vineyard.
They don't even make it anymore.
- Pinot noir?
- Mm-hmm.
- Then how come it's white?
- Oh,Jesus.
Don't ask questions like that
up in wine country.
- They'll think you're some kind of dumbshit.
-Just tell me.
Color in red wines
comes from the skins.
This juice, on the other hand,
is free run...
so that there's no skin contact
during fermentation--
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
-  Oh,yeah.yeah.
- And?
It's great.
I mean, there are so many improvements.
It's much tighter.
Just seems-- I don't know,
more congealed or something.
Mm-hmm. What about the new ending?
Did you like that?
Oh, yeah. New ending
vastly superior to the old ending.
There is no new ending.
Page 7 50 on is exactly the same.
Well, maybe it just seemed new...
because everything leading up to it
was so different?
Yeah! That must be it!
Whoa. Why are we getting off?
- Uh, I just wanna make one quick stop.
- For what?
- I just thought we could say
a quick hello to my mother.
- Your mother?
Look, it's her birthday tomorrow.
Okay?
- And I don't feel right driving by
and not stopping in.
- Okay.
- It'll take a second.
She's right off the freeway.
- Okay.!
I didn't know it was her birthday.
How old is she gonna be?
Uh, oh... 70-something.
Oh. Here, hold these
for just a second.
Thank you.
- Surprise.!
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday, Mom!
- Happy birthday!
Oh, my God! Miles! And Jack!
What a surprise!
I can't remember the last time
you brought me flowers!
Happy birthday, Mom.
They're from both of us.
- A famous actor
bringing me flowers for my birthday!
- Right? Yeah!
- Don't I feel special?
-  And champagne.!
- Famous actor's getting married next week, Mom.
- Oh, that's right!
Isn't that nice.
I hope that girl knows
how lucky she is...
marrying no less
than Derek Sommersby.
Gosh, that was, like, 1 1 years ago,
Mrs. Raymond.
- Well,you were wonderful in that show.!
-
Why that didn't make you the biggest
movie star in the world is a sin!
Oh, now, Miles...
why didn't you tell me you were coming
and bringing this handsome man?
Look how I'm dressed!
I've gotta run and put my face on.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Oh, stop it!
- Make yourselves comfortable.
-
- You boys hungry?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.
Along with the battle casualties...
Just a snack.
the Germans lost almost a million men.
To replace them, Hitler turned
to his last resort of manpower.
This is delicious, Mrs. Raymond.
Absolutely delicious.
- Mmm.
- They're just leftovers.
I-Is this chicken?
I could have made something fancier...
if a certain someone had let me know
that a certain someone...
was coming for a visit
and bringing a certain special friend.
It was a surprise, Mom.
And I could've already put clean sheets...
on the other bed and the foldout.
You are staying.
Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up
at 1 1 :30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton.
They do a magnificent job there.
- You talked to Wendy?
-Just now.
She's thrilled! And the twins--
No, no, I bet. I bet. Yeah.
Well, you know,Jack is pretty eager
to, uh, to get up to, um--
You know.
Uh, but, yeah, absolutely.
We'll see how it goes.
Well, you boys do what you want.
I just thought it would be nice for us
to be together as a family on my birthday.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
I'll be right back.
And what was that other one you did?
The one where you were the jogger.
Oh, that was for, um, Spray 'n Wash.
Spray 'n Wash! That's the one!
Gosh. I remember the girl that was
in it with me. She was somethin'.
I just remember you jogging.
Whoo-hoo!
So, when's the wedding?
Next Saturday, Mom.
Remember? We told you.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond.
My main man.
Miles, when are you going
to get married again?
I just got divorced, Phyllis.
Two years ago, buddy.
You should get back together...
with Victoria.
She was good for you.
She was good for you!
And so beautiful, and so intelligent.
You knew her, right?
Oh,yeah. Real well. Still do.
I'm worried about you, Miles.
Do you need some money?
Jack.
Jack.
Jack, come on.
A rubber bag food slinger?
Are you kidding me?
Our super-amazing tree house...
brought about by our
two-by-four technology--
Jack! No, no, no, no. She'll wake up.
Who did this?
-  I did!
-  What?
She was tired, silly.
Our ship was so high!
They need a vacation!
Hamster holiday! Fun for all!
Fuck! Too early in the morning for that.
You know what I mean?
Oh. She's a kid, for God's sake.
As if she would even be attracted
to guys like us in the first place.
Speak for yourself, man. I get chicks
looking at me all the time. All ages.
Dudes too.
Well, it's not worth it.
You pay too big a price.
- It's never free.
- You need to get laid, Miles.
-
- That's gonna be my best-man gift
to you this week.
I'm gonna get you laid.
Wonderful.
I'm not gonna get you a gift certificate
or a penknife or any of that other horseshit.
- I'd rather have a knife.
- No.
You have been officially depressed
for, like, two years now.
You're a negative guy anyway,
even back in college.
- Mm-hmm.
- And now it's worse.
You're wasting away. Teaching English
to fucking eighth-graders?
When they oughta be reading what you wrote.
Your books, Miles.
- I'm working on it.
-  Not working hard enough.
- Are you still seeing that shrink?
- I saw him on Monday.
I spent most of the time
helping him with his computer.
Well, I say fuck therapy and--
What is that stuff you take? Xanax?
And Lexapro, yes.
Well, I say fuck that too.
You need to get your joint worked on, Miles.
Okay,Jack--Jack--
This week is not about me.
It is about you.
I'm gonna show you a good time.
We're gonna drink a lot of good wine,
we're gonna play some golf...
we're gonna eat some great food,
enjoy the scenery...
and we're gonna send you off in style,
mon frere.
And get your bone smooched.
You know what?
Let's take the Santa Rosa Road exit
and hit Sanford first. Okay?
Sounds good to me. I need a drink.
These guys make top-notch pinot
and chardonnay.
One of the best producers
in Santa Barbara County.
- I thought you hated chardonnay.
- No, no, no. I like all varietals.
I just don't generally like the way
they manipulate chardonnay in California.
- Too much oak and secondary
malolactic fermentation.
- Huh.
You see, the reason that this region
is so good for pinot...
is that the cold air off the Pacific
flows in at night...
and it just cools down the berries.
Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape.
It doesn't like constant heat or humidity.
Very delicate.
Let me show you how this is done.
First thing-- hold the glass up and
examine the wine against the light.
You're looking for color and clarity.
-Just get a sense of it. Okay?
- Okay.
Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy?
- Okay?
- Okay.
Now tip it.
What you're doing here is checking for color
density as it thins out towards the rim.
That's gonna tell you how old it is,
among other things.
It's usually
more important with reds.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Now stick your nose in it.
-  Yeah?
- Don't be shy.
Really get your nose right in there.
Really--
Mmm. A little citrus.
Maybe some strawberry. Mmm.
Passion fruit. Mmm.
And-- Ah, there's just,
like, the faintest...
soupcon of like, uh, asparagus and--
There's a--just a flutter of, like, a--
like, a nutty Edam cheese.
- Wow.
-
Mmm!
- Strawberries. Yeah.
- Good.
- Strawberries. Not the cheese.
- All right.
Put your glass down.
Get some air into it.
Oxygenating it opens it up.
It unlocks the aromas, the flavors.
Very important.
- Smell again.
-
Ah. That's what you do
with every one of'em.
- Wow. When do we drink it?
- Now.
Mmm! Ahh.
- Mmm.
- How would you rate this one, Miles?
Well, usually they start you on wines
with learning disabilities...
but this one is pretty damn good.
- This is the new one. Right, Chris?
-Just released two months ago.
- Nice job.
- We like it.
You could work in a wine store,
Miles.
Mmm. Yeah.
That'd be a good move.
Are you chewing gum?
Do you think I'm making a mistake
marrying Christine?
Whoa!
Do you think I'm doing the right thing, Miles?
Tell me the truth.
I mean, you've been there.
Well, you know, I-- I think that you
waited for some good reason...
and that you proposed to Christine
for some good reason...
so I think it's great.
It's time.
I mean, you gotta have your eyes open,
that's all.
I mean, look at me.
I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Christine's dad,
he's really been talking to me...
about bringing me into his property business,
showing me the ropes.
Which is something, considering how long
it took him to get over my not being Armenian.
So I'm thinking about it.
But I don't know.
Might get a little incestuous.
But Mike does great.
A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
- So you're gonna stop acting?
- No way! No.
This would just provide some stability.
I could always squeeze in a commercial
or an audition here, there.
Keep myself in the game in case
something really great came along.
We're not getting any younger, Miles.
No. No.
- Hey, hey, hey.!
- Hey.
- Miles!
- Sir.
- Long time no see.
- Gary, nice to see you.
- When's your novel coming out?
We all wanna read it.
- Soon, soon, soon.
This is my buddyJack.
He's getting married next week.
- My condolences, man.
- What are you pouring tonight?
- Uh, we have got a lot of good stuff.
- Mm-hmm?
Ah, we have the, uh, new Bien Nacido.
You want a taste?
Absolument.
They make their own wine here.
It's just outstanding.
Very special. Thank you.
Mmm!
- Mmm.
- So, what do you think?
Tighter than a nun's asshole.
But good concentration. Nice fruit.
Pour us a couple, will ya.
Yeah. It's tight.
There you are, gentlemen.
I will leave you the bottle.
And it is good to see you.
Hey, man.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
It's gonna be great.
Here's to us.
- Miles.
- Mm-hmm?
Check out that chick.
Oh. Yeah. That's Maya.
- You know her?
- Sure, I know Maya.
- You know that chick?
- Yes.Jack, this is where I eat
when I come up here.
You know?
It's practically my office.
And occasionally I have a drink
with the employees, yeah.
Maya's great.
She's worked here a year,year and a half.
She's incredibly hot.
Yes, she is.
And nice. And married.
Check out the rock.
Oh, that doesn't mean shit.
When Christine worked at Sushi Roku...
she wore a big engagement ring
to keep guys from hitting on her.
Think it worked? Fuck no.
How do you think I met her?
Well, this gal is married to some
philosophy professor at U.C. Santa Barbara.
What's a professor's wife doing waitressing?
Obviously that's over.
Jack, you don't know anything
about this woman.
Calm down. Let's just eat.
- Hey, Miles!
- Oh! Hi, Maya.
- How are you?
- I'm good. Good.
You look great.
Did you lose some weight?
Uh... no, actually.
But... thank you.
- Busy night, huh?
- Sunday.
You guys been out tasting?
Oh, you know it. You know it.
Oh, this is my friend,Jack.Jack, Maya.
- Hiya.
- Hi.
Well, it's good to see you. Bye, Miles.
Oh. Back to work.
-Jesus, she is jammin'.
- Yeah.
And she's obviously into you.
What else do you know about her?
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Ah. Now we're getting somewhere.
- She likes pinot.
- Perfect!
She's a fucking waitress
in Buellton,Jack.
How is that ever gonna work out?
You dick. Why do you have to
focus on the negative?
- See how friendly she was to you?
- She works for tips.
You're blind, dude. Blind.
I can also recommend the ostrich steak.
Very lean. Locally raised.
Hey, Gary.
- Highliner, please.
- You got it.
- That's on us.
- Yes, indeed.
Well, hey, guys. Do you mind?
- Oh, no, no, no.
- You sure?
Please. Light up, light up.
In fact, would you like to join us?
Sure.
-
- So, how's that book coming, Miles?
I think you were almost finished with it
the last time we talked.
- I finished it.
- Good for you! Wow.
It's getting published.
That's, uh, actually why
we're up here celebrating.
Well, congratulations.
- That's fantastic!
- Yeah.
- Cheers.
- Thanks.
Are you a writer too?
No, Maya, I'm an actor.
Really. What kind of stuff?
Mmm, a lot ofTV.
I used to be a regular
on a couple of series.
But lately it's been a lot of commercial work.
Nationals, mostly.
Anything I might know?
Perhaps. Do you recognize this?
Now with a low, low
That's hilarious!
- You sound just like one of those guys.
- Am one of those guys.
- You are not.
- He is.
Consult your doctor
before using this product.
Side effects may include oily discharge...
hives, loss of appetite,
low blood pressure.
If you have diabetes
or a history of kidney trouble...
you're dead, asshole!
Yeah.
So, what are you guys up to tonight?
Oh, we're pretty wiped.
I think we're just gonna go back
to the motel and crash.
Yeah, I guess it's
kind of a long drive up here.
- Mmm.
- Where are you staying?
Uh, the Windmill.
Windmill.
The girl is looking to party...
and you tell her we're going back
to the motel and crash?
-Jesus, Miles!
- Well, I'm tired,Jack.
- Aren't you tired?
- The chick digs you, man!
She lit up like a pinball machine...
when she found out
your novel was getting published.
Now I have another lie to live down.
- Thanks,Jack.
-Just trying to get you a little action.
I would appreciate a little bit of help.
Didn't seem to me like that's what
was going on. You were all over her.
Well, somebody had to do the talking.
And, by the way, I was right--
she's not married.
- How do you know?
- No rock.
When she came to the bar,
she was sans rock.
Oh.
What's the plan for today, Miles?
Aha.
Good. Um, we head up north--
Begin the grape tour up there...
work our way south...
so that the more we drink...
the closer we get to the motel.
What's your problem?
What is it?
I'm going to get my nut
on this trip, Miles...
and you are not gonna
fuck it up for me...
with all of your depression and anxiety
and neg-head downer shit.
Oh.
Well, now the cards are on the table.
Yes, they are.
- Ah.
- And I am serious. Do not fuck with me, Miles.
I am going to get laid before I get married
on Saturday. Do you read me?
Sure, big guy. Absolutely.
Loud and clear.
Whatever you say.
It's, uh,your party, evidently.
Why don't you just, uh--
Uh, yeah. Why don't you just go out,
and I'll catch a train back.
No, Miles!
Man, this is our week to get crazy.
We should both be cutting loose.
This could be our last chance.
This is our week, man.
It's something we should share.
This is our Syrah.
Okay.
- Ooh!
- Yeah? Like that?
That's a big one.
But it did sit with the skins for
about two weeks in an open-topped tank.
- So that would explain all the tannins, no?
- Well, it is a young wine.
- So as the wine ages, the tannins will dissipate.
- Right. Of course.
- Excuse me for just a minute.
- Good stuff.
Mmm. Fill up there, bub.
This is our estate chardonnay.
Now, there's a girl who knows how to pour.
What's your name?
Stephanie.
Stephanie. Nice.
So, what do you think?
Mmm. Quaffable.
But, uh, far from transcendent.
I like it. Tastes great.
Oak-y.
This is a cabernet franc.
This is only the fifth year
we've made this varietal.
Very few wineries around here
do a straight cab franc.
It's from our vineyards
up in Santa Maria...
and it was a silver medal winner...
at Paso Robles last year.
Hmm.
Mmm.
Well, I will tell you something.
I've come never to expect greatness from
a cab franc, and this one is no different.
It's kind of a hollow, flabby, overripe--
I don't know.
Tastes pretty good to me.
So, um, do you live around here,
Stephanie?
Yeah, up around Los Alamos.
And I agree with you about cab franc.
We're just over in Buellton.
The Windmill Inn.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.
Do you happen to know a gal named Maya
that works at The Hitching Post?
- Yeah. Sure. I know Maya. I know her real well.
- Yeah? No shit?
We had a drink with her last night.
Miles knows her.
Yes. Could we move on
to the Syrah, please?
Oh. Champing at the bit, huh?
Sure.
This is our estate Syrah.
You are a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
I know. I need to be spanked.
Excuse me.
The Syrah?
Hey. Hey. Get the trunk.
- You have the keys.
- I do?
- Yeah.
- In my pocket.
- So, we're on.
- What?
Yeah. She called Maya, who's not working
tonight. So we're all going out.
- Wi-- With Maya?
- Yeah.
She's been divorced a year now, buddy.
This chick Stephanie?
She's got it all goin' on.
Well, she is cute, yeah.
Cute? She's a fuckin' hottie.
And you almost tell her that I'm gettin' married?
What's the matter with you?
- Nice, huh?
- It's beautiful.
Yeah. Victoria and I
used to like this view.
You know,
once we had a picnic here...
and we drank a '95 Opus One.
With smoked salmon and artichokes.
But we didn't care.
Oh, man, she has the best palate
of any woman I have ever known.
She can even differentiate
all different kinds of Italian wines.
- Miles, there's something I gotta tell you.
-
Victoria's coming to the wedding.
Yeah, I know. You told me.
I'm all right with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story.
She got remarried.
She what?
When?
About a month ago.
Maybe six weeks.
To that guy--
that guy with the restaurant?
Miles?
Miles.
I'd like to go home now.
Miles, get out of the car.
Would you drive me
back to the motel, please?
You know--
She bringing him to the wedding?
What do you think?
Why didn't you tell me
about this before,Jack?
Because I knew you'd get so freaked out
that you wouldn't even come on this trip.
But then I thought,
this is the perfect place to tell you.
We're here to forget about all that shit.
We're here to party, man.
I'm gonna be a fucking pariah.
Persona non grata.
Everybody's gonna be holding their breath,
waiting to see if I get drunk and make a scene.
No, no. No. Look.
I talked to Victoria. Okay?
I talked to Victoria. Okay?
She's cool. Everybody's cool.
I'm sorry. You've been talking--
Behind my back...
you've been talking about it?
What are you doing?
Come back here.
Miles!
- Come here. Give me that bottle.
- Back off,Jack.
- Come on--
- Back off, man!
- Give me that bottle.
- No.
Miles.
Miles!
-
-
A lot of people
out there think they can make it.
What better thing in life is to chase the
dream and not be afraid of going after it?
James Lepp next to play.
Chance for a birdie and a five-shot lead.
I'm gonna go for a swim,
get the blood flowing. You wanna come?
No. I wanna watch this.
Okay.
Should start this ball one or two inches
outside the left edge.
Go in.
-  Great putt.
-  Absolutely. Great speed.
-  Miles.
-
Miles.
Oh, Miles. Time to get up.
This fuckin' chick in theJacuzzi--
Oh, dude!
This place is wide open.
I'm goin' fuckin' nuts up here, man.
- Hey, what should I wear?
- I don't know.
Something casual, but nice.
They think you're a writer.
Right. Okay.
Mmm.
Do you have any other shoes?
Uh-uh.
Hmm.
-
- Hey, honey.
Yeah, I was just calling to check in.
Miles and I are getting ready
to go to dinner.
Probably stay out late, so I just thought
I'd call and say good night now.
Yeah. I miss you too.
Yeah. I love you too.
Just try to be your normal,
humorous self. Okay?
The guy you were before the tailspin.
Do you remember that guy?
People love that guy.
And don't forget--
your novel is coming out in the fall.
Oh. Really? How exciting.
What's it called?
Come here, Miles. Come here.
Do not sabotage me.
If you wanna be a fuckin' lightweight,
then that's your call.
- But do not sabotage me.
- Oh, aye, aye, cap'n. You got it.
And if they wanna drink merlot,
we're drinkin' merlot.
If anybody orders merlot, I'm leaving.
I am not drinking any fucking merlot!
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles.
Jesus. No merlot.
Did you bring your Xanax?
-
- All right.
Come here.
Do not drink too much.
Do you hear me?
I don't want you passing out
or going to the dark side.
- No going to the dark side!
- Okay!
Hi.Just looking for some friends.
- #
-
Good evening, ladies.
How are you?
- Hi, Miles.
-  Good. How are you?
Hello, Maya.
- You look gorgeous. You both do.
-  Thank you.
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Thanks. Thanks.
So, what's good here?
- What is this you're drinking?
- Oh, this is the Fiddlehead sauvignon blanc.
- Ah, I see. Is it good?
- Try it.
- What time did you close up at Ka-- Is it--
- Kalyra.
- Kalyra.
- I actually got out of there pretty good,
around 5:30, 6:00.
- Still had some stuff to do.
- Miles and I, we were--
- That's nice.
- It's aged 1 2 months in oak.
- French oak.
- Sauvignon blanc?
Huh. Interesting. It's good.
I know the winemaker.
She comes into the restaurant all the time.
- What do you have to do to close up?
- I close up the register.
Clean up, put some stuff away.
Then put the glasses out for the next day.
- Right.
-Just... small stuff.
Uh, hints of clove.
- Right?
- Yes! I know. I love that.
Yeah. Mmm.
Sorry. It's good.
- No, no. We'll get you a glass.
- Ah! Now we're thinking.
Good.  Okay.
Oh, that's-- that--
Oh, he can say it,
and it's not disgusting?
I didn't hear him say that.
- Whenever I say something he said--
-  Very good.
No, actually-- No. That one.
N-Not this one--
I'm having that too.
- Right?
- Oh, yes.
That's what I'm saying.
For our soup we have corn chowder...
and for our entrees we have medallions
of pork dusted with black truffles...
served with a root vegetable foulon
and wasabi whipped potatoes.
And finally--
-  I have to explain my credentials.
-  Yes.!
Miles, what does this remind you of?.
"Red wine. Red wine."
He was brought up on a lot of charges.
- Yeah?
- I mean, with the yellow light.
Right.
After all, tonight
we are celebrating Miles's book deal.
- Published author.
- Oh! Wow!
Wow, Miles.!
- Ohh.!
-  Well, in that case--
And then they think you have no idea.
You have no control over it.
Ancient way of treating the grape.
Now it's a modern way
of treating the grape.
It's a traditional way of dealing with wine.
It's a controversial way.
So everyone's going back to that.
It's just that there's
a certain constant lapping.
- It's not a-- It's a fishing lake.
- Mm-hmm.
Your lips look soft.
- The whole area is--
- Oh, no. You mean, like, what it was used for?
- What do they call the--
-
Malibu-- It's Malibu Canyon.
-
-
I don't know what the hell
I'm trying to say.
-
-
-
-  Hello?
Victoria?
Miles?
Well, well, well, well, well.
Victoria. How the hell are ya?
What-- Uh-- What's on your mind?
Oh, nothin'. I--
Just heard that you got remarried.
Congratulations. I, uh--
Boy, I didn't think you had the stomach
for another go-around.
Oh, Miles, you're drunk.
Oh,just a little local pinot,
you know.
A little burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune.
- Where are you?
- Uh, a little place in Los Olivos.
New owners. Cozy ambience, uh--
Excellent food too.
You should, uh-- You should try it.
I thought of you at the, uh,
Hitching Post last night.
Hello?
- Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
- No, it's--
All right, I just--
I wanted to let you know...
that I have decided
not to come to the wedding...
so just in case you were dreading some sort of,
you know, run-in or something like that...
well, you worry no more...
because I'm not gonna be there.
It's my little wedding gift
to you and what's-his-name.
What is his name?
Ken.
Ken! Right.
Ken.
I'm gonna hang up now, Miles.
No-- You know, it's just--
I-I-I heard about this...
for the first time, uh, today.
Uh, your getting remarried, that is.
And, uh, I was kind of taken aback.
Just... hard to believe.
I guess I thought maybe
there was still a chance...
for us somewhere down the road.
And I just, uh--
- Miles.
- Huh?
Maybe it is better
if you don't come to the wedding.
All righty, Vicki. Whatever you say.
You're the boss.
Huh? I don't know.
Welcome back.
Take it easy.
- Are you okay, Miles?
- Yes. I'm fine.
Thank you.
- Excuse us, gentlemen.
- Excuse us.
Sure.
- Mmm.
- All right.
Yeah. Don't take too long.
- All right.
- Okay. Bye, girls.
What the fuck?
What is up with you?
- You remember our little talk outside?
- Yeah--
- Get your shit together, Miles.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
Where were you?
Bathroom.
Did you drink and dial?
Hmm?
- No.
- Why do you always have to do this?
Victoria is gone. Gone.
Poof!. In the wind.
I mean, you are blowing a great
opportunity here with Maya.
Maya-- Fuckin' Maya-- She's great!
She's cool, she's funny, she knows wine.
What is this morose, come-down bullshit?
These girls wanna party with us.
Huh?
And what was that 1 0-minute lecture
on, what, Vouvrays?
Are you kidding me?
Who gives a fuck?
Let's just say that I'm uncomfortable
with the whole scenario.
Have you forgotten all the bad times
you had with Victoria...
how small she could make you feel?
Isn't that why you had the affair
with Brenda in the first place?
Shut up. Shut your face. Shut up.
Have you even noticed
how Maya's looking at you?
Now, come on, man.
You've got her on the hook.
Reel her in.
Let's ratchet this up a notch.
Here. Drink some agua fria.
-
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Mmm.
Ah. Well, so, uh,
shall we get some dessert?
Uh, well, we were thinking, um, uh,
why don't we go back to my place?
I've got wine, some insane cheeses,
music, whatever.
Yeah!
-
- Waiter!
Come here.
Uh-huh.
- One for you, three for me.
- Mmm.
You sure you wanna do this?
#
- We're here!
-  Hey.!
- Hey!
- Where were you guys?
Oh, we took a couple of wrong turns,
thanks to Magellan here.
-  Hi.
- Hi.
- Oh, Miles.
- Yeah?
- Maya's in the back,just past the kitchen.
- Okay.
-
- Thanks.
#
Hi.
Hey.
- Oh, has she got anything good?
- Oh,yeah.
Steph's way into pinots and Syrahs.
- Hey, Steph!
- Yeah?
- Can we really open anything we want?
- Yeah,yeah. Anything.
Uh, except the Richebourg.
Richebourg? She has a Richebourg?
Holy mackerel.
I've completely
underestimated Stephanie.
Oh, good Lord. Um, look at that.
I think... this guy's more our speed.
Andrew Murray.
Well, okay. All right.
So, what gems do you have
in your collection?
Oh, it's really not much
of a collection, you know.
I mean, more like a small gathering
in a cabinet.
-
- No, I've never really had the wallet for that.
I just have to live bottle to bottle.
I've got things I'm saving, definitely.
I guess the star would be
a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc,
and it's just sitting there?
- Yes, I do.
- Go get it.
-  Okay.
- I'm serious! Hurry!
All right. I would, I would.
The '61 s are peaking right now, aren't they?
That's what I've read.
No, that's right, yeah.
It might be too late already.
What are you waiting for?
Oh, I don't know.
A special occasion with the right person.
- It was supposed to be for
my 1 0th wedding anniversary, but--
- Mmm.
You know, the day you open
a '6 1 Cheval Blanc...
that's the special occasion.
So, uh, how long
have you been into wine?
I got serious about seven years ago.
- And what was the bottle that did it?
- '88 Sassicaia.
- Ah.! Well, congratulations.
- Mmm.
- Yeah.
- That's very good.
- Well--
- That would do it. Yeah.
Hmm.
Mmm.
Oh, wow, that's nice.
That's very good.
We need to give it a minute,
but that's really tasty.
How about you?
I think they overdid it a little.
Too much alcohol.
It overwhelms the fruit.
Huh.
Yeah. Yeah.
I'd say you're right on the money.
Very good.  Nice.
- Thank you.
- Mmm.
Mmm! Is that Stephanie's kid?
Oh. Yeah. That's Siena.
- Oh, she's a sweetie.
- Cute. Cute.
Where is she?
- She's at her grandmother's.
- Oh.
Steph's mom.
She spends a lot of time over there.
You got kids?
Uh, me? No. No.
- No, I'd just fuck 'em up.
-
No, that was the one unpolluted part
of my divorce-- no kids.
Yeah. Same here.
Good.
Let's go in there.
Now, for a low, low
Looks like our friends
are really hitting it off.
- Yeah, I would say that.
-
- Yeah.
-
-
- So, what's your novel about?
What's my-- Oh, brother.
Well, it's, uh--
it's difficult to summarize.
Um...
it starts out as a kind of
first-person narrative...
about a guy taking care
of his father after a stroke.
- Oh.
- It's kind of based on, uh, personal experience.
But only-- only loosely.
What's the title?
The Day After Yesterday.
Oh. You mean today.
Um... uh, yeah.
I mean, r-right. But it's more--
So it's about, like,
death and mortality, or--
Uh, yeah--
Y-- Not really.
I, uh-- It de-- It jumps around a lot.
That's what it's about, in a way.
You know what I mean?
You start to see everything
from the point of view of the father.
And, uh, a lot of other things happen--
parallel narratives.
It's kind of a mess.
And then, eventually,
the whole thing sort of evolves...
or devolves...
into this sort of
Robbe-Grillet mystery.
You know?
But no real resolution.
- Wow.
-  It--
Well, I think it's really great
you're getting it published.
Really. I mean, I know how hard it is
just to write it, even.
Yeah.
I mean, like me, I've got this paper
due on Friday...
and I'm freaked out about it,
just like in high school.
- A paper, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm going for a master's degree
in horticulture.
Sorta chipping away on it.
- Horticulture? Really?
- Mmm.
I didn't even know
that there was a college here.
Well, I commute to San Luis Obispo
twice a week.
Horticulture? Wow.
So, do you want to work
in a winery or something?
Maybe.
Oh.
Hmm.
So, when can I read your book?
Well, I-- You know, I-- Well, I do happen
to have a manuscript in my car.
Um, it's not proofed or anything...
so it's-- it's full of typos.
- If you don't mind typos--
- Oh, no. Who cares?
I'm the queen of typos.
Okay.
Mmm.
Ahh.
You know, can I ask you
a personal question, Miles?
Sure.
Why are you so into pinot?
-
- I mean, it's like a thing with you.
Uh... I don't know. I don't know.
Um... it's a hard grape to grow.
As you know. Right?
It's, uh-- It's thin-skinned...
temperamental, ripens early.
It's-- You know, it's not a survivor...
like cabernet...
which can just grow anywhere...
and thrive even when it's neglected.
No, pinot needs constant care
and attention. You know?
And, in fact, it can only grow...
in these really specific,
little tucked-away corners of the world.
And-- And only...
the most patient
and nurturing of growers...
can do it, really.
Only somebody
who really takes the time...
to understand pinot's potential...
can then coax it
into its fullest expression.
And then? I mean--
Oh, its flavors, they're just
the most haunting and brilliant...
and thrilling and subtle and...
ancient on the planet.
No, I mean, you know, cabernets
can be powerful and exalting too...
but they seem prosaic to me,
for some reason, by comparison.
-
- I don't know. I don't know.
What about you?
What about me?
I don't know.
Why are you into wine?
Oh, I-- I think I--
- I originally got into wine through my ex-husband.
- Ah.
You know, he had this big
sort of show-off cellar.
- You know?
- Right.
- But then I discovered that
I had a really sharp palate.
- Mm-hmm.
And the more I drank...
the more I liked
what it made me think about.
Like what?
Like what a fraud he was.
Wow.
No, I mean, I like to think
about the life of wine.
Yeah.
How it's a living thing.
I like to think about...
what was going on the year
the grapes were growing...
how the sun was shining...
if it rained.
I like to think about...
all the people who tended
and picked the grapes...
and, if it's an old wine,
how many of them must be dead by now.
I like how wine continues to evolve.
Like,
if I opened a bottle of wine today...
it would taste different than if
I'd opened it on any other day.
Because a bottle of wine
is actually alive...
and it's constantly evolving
and gaining complexity.
That is, until it peaks...
like your '61 .
And then it begins its steady...
inevitable decline.
Hmm.
And it tastes so fucking good.
Yeah.
But you know, I-- I, uh--
I like other wines besides pinot too.
I mean, lately
I've been really into Rieslings.
You like Rieslings? Rieslings?
Mm-hmm.
There's a bathroom in the back?
- Yeah. It's through the kitchen.
- I'll be right back.
God, you are such a fuckin' loser.
You make me so fuckin' sick.
Oh, God. Ah, come on.
Hi.
- I was just getting some water.
- Okay.
- You want some water?
- No.
Okay. It's getting kind of late.
I should really go.
So you know how to get to the Windmill?
Two rights and a left.
- Got it.
- Okay.
I had a nice time tonight, Miles.
I really did.
Good. So did I.
- Okay. Well, I'll see you around then.
- Um--
Did you still want to read my novel?
Oh, yeah. Of course.
Yeah.
- Great.
-Just a sec.
- Here.
- Oh, wow.
Well, I hope you like it.
And feel free to stop reading it any time.
I will not be offended.
Okay.
- Well, good night, Miles.
- Good night.
#

Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck.
-
-
-
-
That fucking chick is unbelievable, dude.
Unbelievable!
Whoo! Boy.
Ohh, she is nasty, Miles.
Nasty, nasty, nasty.!
- Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system.
- Yeah, baby.
Congratulations.
Mission accomplished.
