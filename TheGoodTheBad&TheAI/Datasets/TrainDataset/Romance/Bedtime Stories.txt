one must first be sure
the audience is prepared.
I owned and operated
the Sunny Vista Motel,
which I established on the corner
of Sunset and La Cienega Boulevards
in Los Angeles, California,
in the year 1974.
and I ran it with the help
of my children: Wendy...
Wendy, the key, please,
for Mr. And Mrs. Dixon.
Thank you.
May I help you with your
bags, Mr. And Mrs. Dixon?
- Yes, please.
- Why, thank you, young man.
You, uh, need a hand?
No, no. I got it.
OK.
To my boy Skeeter, the
motel was a wonderland.
Way too hyper.
The galaxy's not big
enough for the both of us.
Full of new adventures
for a six-year-old boy.
Oh, Skeeter. Come here.
Skeeter loved the old
place as much as I did.
And he always tried to come up
with ways to make it even better.
I've got a lot of ideas how
to improve things around here.
I was thinking we could put an
extra pair of socks in each room
because people always forget to pack
enough socks when they go on a trip.
That's a good idea.
Time for bed, I'm meeting
with Mr. Nottingham.
Well, how about a bedtime story?
Yay!
Now, once upon a time,
there was a little boy,
and that little boy's name was Skeeter.
Well, I could tell a pretty fair
tale when the muse was with me.
Yeah, I was a pretty good
dad and a pretty good host.
But unfortunately, a
pretty bad businessman.
Can't you read the writing
on the wall, Bronson?
This motel is sinking in red ink...
and I'm offering you the last lifeboat.
I don't know.
If you don't sell to me,
you're going to go bankrupt.
Yes, well, I...
I'd always hoped this place
would be a home for my children.
How about this?
If your boy works hard and shows
some smarts when he grows up,
I'll let him run this place.
You promise?
Yes. Now sign the bloody papers.
That's my boy, Bronson.
Trust me, I'm going to turn this place
into the finest hotel in Los Angeles.
It's going to be
uptight and out of sight.
And just like that, our modest
little Sunny Vista Motel...
... metamorphosized into the
mighty Sunny Vista Nottingham.
it has been lovingly maintained
by my now grown-up son,
Yes, though Mr. Nottingham's
promise for Skeeter to run the place
- seems to have been forgotten...
- Hiya, Pop.
... my boy always works
diligently with a hopeful heart,
Mrs. Dixon? Is there a
problem with her room?
Nothing you should bother
your tiny mind about.
Mrs. Dixon has been taking the nip
bottles of liquor out of her mini-bar,
and doesn't want to pay for it.
I never even touched that
evil little refrigerator.
I don't drink alcohol.
Of course. There's probably a mix-up.
- I saw who took it.
- OK.
He had red hair and a beard.
He was wearing a green
suit with brass buttons.
And he stands about ten inches tall.
So we're talking about a leprechaun?
There you go.
Oh, I didn't know your
brother was in town.
So, um, here's what
I think we should do.
Put all the missing bottles on my tab.
Next time you see any
leprechauns, we'll tell Aspen.
She's half-troll.
I think, trolls eat
leprechauns, am I right?
She would.
Today magic is in the
air at the grand hotel,
and the winds of change
are about to blow our story
founded by someone who loved
a good story as much as I?
Time is of the essence here, Skeeter.
Oh, yeah, I know. I just don't want
the big boss man to get electrocuted.
Of course.
- You fixed it?
- Let me see here.
Yo, yo. Yo, yo.
Check, check. One, two. Come on.
Yeah, yeah. Hear me in the back?
- Whoa, whoa.
- Skeeter.
I say "Barry," you say "Nottingham."
- Barry.
- Nottingham.
- Barry.
- Nottingham.
Got them warmed up for you, sir.
- It's good to see you again.
- Germs.
- Germs?
- Uh, Skeeter,
Mr. Nottingham has
developed a fear, uh...
Not a fear, an awareness...
...of germs and how
dangerous they can be
when not properly... feared, so...
You're doing the right
thing. I didn't shower today.
So, yeah, let me get out of here.
- He's brilliant, him. I love this guy.
- Welcome.
As you know, I own 23 hotels
from Berlin to Beijing.
But it's no secret that this one,
the Sunny Vista
Nottingham, is my favorite.
We need something for the 21 st century.
And so, we have decided
to close this hotel
and to build a brand-new
Sunny Vista Mega Nottingham.
This will be the largest
hotel on the West Coast.
I simply don't understand what the
fuss is about. It's just a big building.
Oh, no, no. This is like the
future of the hotel business.
...and a top-secret theme
that will blow your mind.
Yes!
So I'm proud to announce the
new hotel's general manager.
He's been waiting on
this for a long time.
We all know how hard he
works, how intelligent he is,
how much this hotel means to him.
Take a bow, Mr. Kendall Duncan!
Take a bow, Kendall.
- God bless.
- Boo!
A beautiful speech,
sir. A beautiful speech.
I'm so glad you could come.
It's great to see you.
Don't touch me.
Well done, Daddy.
Oh, oh, hello there. Do you
know my daughter, Violet?
Only by reputation, sir.
Excuse me?
No, no, not that she has a reputation.
Not hot as in hot.
Hot, I meant warm... Warm-hearted.
And she likes to go out
and have fun, festive times,
in bars, with a lot of
different guys, and...
That's the old Violet
Nottingham. Before she met me.
Now it's up to me to keep my
pooky-bear out of the spotlight
and nightclubs and tabloids.
Isn't that right, sir?
Violet's off to her private
tennis lesson with Roger Federer.
- Oh. All right, good for you.
- Bye, boys.
Got to say, uh...
...it's gonna be hard for me to see
the hotel move locations like this.
Well, I, I do hope you'll feel
able to come and work with us there.
Big as Kendall wants to make it,
well, there's going to be a
lot of light bulbs to change.
Someone touched me.
Is there any sanitizer?
There is, sir. Come this
way. I'll get you some.
Can't be too careful, Kendall.
All right, everyone finished
at the pottery table,
bring their art to the kiln.
The man with the rescue
donkey's leaving in five minutes,
Oh, I'm not a principal
at this party. I'm a mom.
Hey!
I notice no one's eating the
gluten-free wheatgrass cake.
Come on. Trust me, you just
got to get past the smell.
What? The clown died?
- What's in that bag?
- Oh, chocolate chip cookie.
- Food!
- Food!
- Slow it down, slow it down.
- Hey, sissy.
Why do you bring sugary, chemical-filled
crud to my house every time you visit?
What? Every time? You haven't
invited me here in four years.
What are you talking about?
It hasn't been four years.
You were here for The
Fourth of July barbecue
when you punched my husband?
Yes. That was four years ago.
I wanted to give him a wedgie,
but his underwear had holes in it.
I knew he'd be your
ex-husband. You should be happy.
All right. Let's not start.
How are the kids handling
They're both kind of off right
now. Bobbi's been really quiet.
Why don't you go say hi.
I'm gonna pay the donkey guy.
- Is that what stinks in here?
- No, it's the cake.
What did she make, donkey cake?
I smell manure.
Hey, you guys. Remember me?
Uncle Skeeter.
Man, you got big. Haven't
seen you in a while.
Happy birthday there, Bobbi.
I'm Patrick. She's Bobbi.
Oh, my bad.
Got you a little something.
Happy birthday, Bobbi.
Here you go. Picked it up at the hotel.
How's school going?
- Skeeter?
- Yeah.
Getting called to the
principal's office. Look at that.
Yes, yes.
Shampoo?
And a soap?
Hanger and a towel.
Do not talk about school with them.
What's going on with the school?
- They're closing it down.
- No.
- I'm getting laid off.
- You?
You're like the classic
school principal.
I mean, you're, you're
scary and bad with people.
Children are nervous around you.
That doesn't sound right, but, I'm
just saying, what else could you do?
Maybe, Cuban dictator? Or the
bogeyman. You could be the bogeyman.
- Anyway...
- What, what?
I've got some interviews
set up in Arizona,
which is kind of what I
wanted to talk to you about.
Uh-oh.
I need you to watch
the kids... for a week.
It's not going to be difficult, Skeeter.
My friend Jill is a
teacher at my school.
She'll bring the kids in with her
and watch them till dinnertime.
All you gotta do is the night shift.
Why can't your stupid friend do that?
She's got night school. Skeeter!
My husband left me.
I'm getting laid off.
So you need me. This is good.
I'll do it.
But you got to say,
"Skeeter is the coolest. I am a nerd."
"Skeeter's the coolest. I'm a nerd?"
Yeah, you are! Whoo!
OK. Hey, you guys.
I'm going to hang out with
you this week. All right?
Maybe we can go... fishing.
I'd rather you didn't.
Patrick's not a strong swimmer.
OK, we'll stay inside.
How about, uh, we play some poker?
- I can teach you that.
- Gambling? I don't think so.
OK, how about we just
take walks in the park
- and catalog plant species?
- Now you're talking.
I don't know anything about plants
except you try to
make cakes out of them!
He liked that one. I'm
gonna end with a laugh.
I wasn't gonna hit you. I was
trying to do the fist thing.
You don't know the fist thing?
OK, I was just...
That's what, uh, the children do.
Hey, yeh, yeh.
Oh, this your truck, chief?
Yes, it is, ma'am.
You realize you're taking
up two parking spaces?
It's a big truck, ma'am.
It's not that big, sir.
You could fit into one spot.
I had to park all the
way down the block.
Well, next time park in that
box. Plenty of room in there.
Anyway, here's the situation.
This is not really my truck,
this is the hotel I work for's truck.
So if I get a scratch on it,
they take it out of my salary.
So two parking spaces
provides me with what I call
"a cushion of protection."
Wait, a hotel? Oh, wait.
You're Wendy's brother.
- Yeah.
- I'm Jill.
- Who's that?
- I'm her friend,
the one helping take care of
the kids. I'm the day shift.
OK, June. You plan on being
this hostile the whole time?
Jill. My name is Jill.
Do you plan on keeping that
haircut the rest of the time?
Oh, haven't you heard?
Goofy's the new handsome.
- That sounds good for the environment.
- Oh, we can't all have Priuses.
Your whole aura reads Prius.
Anyways, you're in my cushion
of protection right now.
I want to back up, so if you
could just zing-zang up there,
- that would be helpful.
- Yeah.
You might want some
Cinnabons. You'll need it.
Food!
Give it back! Somebody
owes me six bucks!
So why didn't you demand that he make
you the big boss of the new hotel?
He promised your dad.
I wanted to. It just
wasn't the right time.
Let me tell you how it works.
because he's dating his daughter.
That's the way it works,
keep it in the family.
He gets the girl, he gets
the job, he gets everything.
And I get nothing.
- Hello?
- Where are you? Still there?
I'm still where? Who's this?
Look, I've got to get to class.
The kids are waiting for you, OK?
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.
I forgot. I'll be there
in like 20 minutes.
I'm gonna baby-sit my
nephew and niece tonight.
Yes, I do. Sometimes I
baby-sit my cousins, right?
And what I do is I
let them style me hair.
Like put beads into it and braid
it, make me look all real sexy.
Like Milli Vanilli, stuff
like that. You should try that.
Braid my hair? That's a good
idea. Can I have some French fries?
Of course you can.
You're my best friend.
Ah! Actually, I really
like ketchup on my face
Mmm! Delicious.
Do you think these signs will help?
Well, miracles happen, you know?
You mean like Dad coming back?
Um...
Hey! Sorry I'm late.
So, um, their pajamas are on their beds,
and I will be back, um, at
- All right.
- Here is my cell phone number.
And call me if there's any emergencies.
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.
All packed up here.
I got my, uh, toothbrush
and, uh, and the toothpaste.
Some clean underwear.
Well, maybe not that clean.
You guys want to watch TV?
- Hello?
- Emergency!
Wendy doesn't let them
watch TV. You didn't know?
I don't know a lot of
things about these kids.
I wasn't allowed over here.
Their old man didn't like me.
OK, listen, you don't need a TV. You
can, um, play a game, do a puzzle.
I'm sure you can figure
something out. OK?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Should I let
them braid my hair or something?
Would they like that?
I don't think anyone
should touch that hair.
Hey, what do you say we go...
next door and toilet paper
your neighbor's trees?
No? OK, bedtime!
OK, so you guys cool?
Whoo! What do you got here, anyways?
Mmm, no.
"The Organic Squirrel
Gets a Bike Helmet"?
I'm not reading these
communist books to you guys.
Don't you got any real stories?
- Like what?
- Like what?
Like, like cowboys? Or dragons?
Or aliens? Or... What the
heck is on my head right now?
That's Bugsy, our guinea pig.
- Why do you call him Bugsy?
- Because of his eyes.
Let me see them.
Wow! Those eyes would be big on a cow.
Are those eyeballs or bowling balls?
Can't keep my eyes off of them.
Just get in there so I don't have
to look at them anymore. Goodbye.
Anyways, uh,
you guys want me to, uh,
make up a story for you?
Like, like my old man used to do for me?
Maybe I could be good at this.
All right, um...
Here goes.
Once upon a time, in a
magical, faraway kingdom...
that weary travelers from near
and far would come and visit.
Now, this knight had been
working his butt off for years.
You'd think he'd be a shoo-in
to rule the castle, right?
- Right.
- Wrong.
Actually, he wasn't
even a knight at all.
Oh, no.
And even though he was the son
of the late, great Lord Marty...
Thank you.
... and knew everything there is
to know about running a castle,
What's "underdemeciated"?
- Under de-what?
- Underdemeciated.
That's right, I forgot you were six.
His name was
Sir... Fix-A-Lot.
But alas, the kingdom
where Sir Fix-A-Lot lived
did not place much value on
dedication or hard work, I guess.
Because the superstar in all
the land was Sir Butt-Kiss.
And he spent all his days
kissing everybody's butt.
Boo!
And my lord, yes, of
course I can get you
And Sir Fix-A-Lot had a
best friend, Friar Fred,
who was not right in the head.
She never! No! Not our
queen, I won't have that.
- Were there any kids in the kingdom?
- Yes, yes. Of course.
Mistress Stinky and Master Smelly.
Hey-oh! And don't forget...
Jillian! The queen of the fairies!
I mean, if she has to be there,
let's just make her an angry raven.
Parking spot!
Yeah. The best mermaid
teacher in the world.
Children, open your books to page 16.
Yes, Miss Mermaid.
Let's begin.
All right, she's a
mermaid. Whatever you want.
Anyways, back to the story.
One day the king invited all
his subjects to the castle.
I bring glad tidings.
who will run this castle
and be my closest
advisor and bestest buddy.
My new champion is...
...Sir Butt-Kiss!
Thank you.
Poor Sir Fix-A-Lot
had been passed over.
So, Sir Fix-A-Lot
moved into a giant shoe,
Ah, what the heck.
The end.
The end? That can't be the end.
- Why? Why not?
- It's not happy.
There aren't happy endings in real
life. Sooner you know that, the better.
- It's not fair!
- What? What's not fair?
I mean, shouldn't Sir Fix-A-Lot
at least get a shot to be champion?
- A shot? Hmm...
- If Sir Fix-A-Lot is better
than Sir Butt-Kiss, he should
get a chance to prove it.
OK. Yeah, yeah, Bobbi, good.
What the king really said was...
On second thought,
there is another worthy
man in my kingdom,
and it wouldn't be fair
unless he got a shot, too.
Sir
Fix-A-Lot!
But, Sire, Fix-A-Lot
is as common as muck.
Boo!
And Friar Fred drop-kicked
a booing goblin.
Boo!
And the mermaid teacher did one
of those weird tail dolphin moves.
And Stinky and Smelly did
the fastest Irish jig ever.
Yeah. Right on.
Prince Bugsy busted
out some fancy moves.
And then... and then...
It started raining gumballs.
Raining gumballs?
Why not? It's a bedtime
story. Anything can happen.
Yeah, yeah. I guess in a story.
I just wish it was like that
in real life. I really do.
- What was that?
- Bugsy.
Oh.
He rings that bell when he's hungry?
No, when he needs to go to sleep.
OK. As you wish, Your Highness.
All right, you guys, have a good
sleep. You, too, uh, weird eyes.
but I will make us
a delicious breakfast
that I know you will enjoy.
Yes, some banana on the rice cake,
and then what do we
call this? Wheat germ.
I was told germs are bad
for you, but here goes.
I like it.
A rice cake-banana-wheat
germ sandwich.
And what do we got?
This is terrible.
Doesn't your, your
mother have taste buds?
What are we doing here? We got
nothing to use in this house.
Hang on.
It's good because, now we
don't have to brush our teeth.
There you go. At least we got a
little mint going on. Guys want one?
Bronson? The television
set in Mr. Nottingham's room
is broken and it needs
to be fixed right away.
I have a situation here. I'm
watching my nephew and my niece.
I'm sorry. Are you having
difficulty hearing me?
Mr. Nottingham wants
to watch television now!
I hear you. I speak
trollinese, don't worry.
Gotcha.
Thanks a lot, gentlemen. OK.
- Wow.
- It's pretty, huh?
Whoa!
I got to go fix my boss' television set,
but I need somebody to watch you two.
Hang on.
Violet! Skeeter Bronson, the
handyman from the other day.
Oh, right. Yes.
Listen, uh, I got some
kids with me right now.
My nephew and niece. But, I
gotta fix your father's TV.
Could you watch them a few minutes?
Huh?
Yeah, yeah. All right, I'm going.
Come in.
- Mr. Nottingham, sir?
- Uh, the telly won't turn on.
It won't? Well, let me just
take a... tallyho at it, OK?
I'll just flip this light on.
No, no, no, no! Absolutely not!
I'm fighting a cold here.
I must stay in the
dark whenever possible.
Do you realize
germs can reproduce 80
percent faster in bright light?
Oh, OK. Here we go, nice and dark again.
- The germs are confused.
- Come towards me.
OK. It's got to be
around here somewhere.
I'm so sorry, sir. I
just can't see a thing.
- To your left, there.
- Oh!
There's the TV. So how's the,
uh, new hotel coming, sir?
Oh, very well. Still dealing with the
city on building permits and whatnot.
Uh-huh.
I can't tell you the secret theme.
It's so good, we don't
want anyone to steal it.
- I hear you, sir.
- OK, I'll tell you.
Come along, sit down. Please.
Great.
Ready?
Rock and roll.
Vintage vinyl. Music
memorabilia in the lobby.
Oh, OK. Like, uh, like the Hard Rock?
- The What What?
- The Hard Rock Hotel.
They've been using that
theme for, like, years.
Get Kendall Duncan up
here straightaway, please.
What a perfect little powder puff.
Thank you.
So, Patrick, truth or dare?
Truth?
How old were you the first
time you kissed a girl?
Girls are bis-crusting.
Except for Trisha Sparks.
Ooh, is that a girl in your
class, you little Romeo?
Hey, guys.
Hi, Aunt Jill, did you
get the note we left you?
Yes, I did.
And, uh, now we have to get you
guys ready for school. So, come on.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Oh, hey. You're, uh...
- Uh-huh. Here's your fat mouse.
- It's a guinea pig, but...
And you, young man...
I want to hear all about this little
Trisha Sparks next time I see you.
Trisha Sparks is two
years older than you.
She's hot.
I'm very disappointed in you, Kendall.
We almost made an apocalyptic mistake.
This rock and roll idea
of yours is old hat.
Well, sir, I had every intention
of putting our own spin on it.
Do you know what, Skeeter?
I'm starting to get a fuzzy recollection
of something I said to your father.
If you can come up with a
better theme than Kendall does,
I'll let you run the new place instead.
Oh, sir.
Don't you think this is perhaps
a little too much of a cruel joke
to be playing on somebody as...
well, the, the maintenance guy?
- No, I don't.
- No.
Mr. Bronson has been working
for this company for 25 years.
I'm beginning to think I may have
seriously underdemeciated him.
I'm sorry. "Underdemeciated"?
Precisely. You can both present your
ideas at my birthday party this weekend.
Thank you, Kendall. That is all.
Mr. Bronson, the
television, if you would.
Oh, and do watch out
for the germ vaporizer.
The best day of my life!
Whoa. I like your car, pal.
Hey, thanks, champ.
You know what they say.
You want to be the best,
you got to drive the best.
Hey, uh, not to get personal,
but what's a sweet ride
like that cost, anyways?
You know what? Actually
it's surprisingly affordable.
Yeah?
If you saved every paycheck you
earn for the rest of your life
and then multiply it by ten, you
could probably buy my muffler.
Ah-ooga!
Oh, you wanna drag race, do you?
You win! Good job.
What?
This is spooky.
You've got to be kidding me! Look
at this. I'm losing all my candy.
How can you not see a
So you have to compete for your job with
Skeeter Bronson. You'll annihilate him.
Oh, I know. It's just a
little degrading, that's all.
Thanks for being there.
I'll be there as long as
there's a there to be at.
Oh, hello, children.
We're looking for Skeeter Bronson.
Oh, Mr. Bronson.
Yes, you'll find him in room 109.
- OK.
- Please, this way.
- Oh, my God! Did you see that thing?
- Those eyes.
They were, they were staring
into my, my very soul.
- Hey, Uncle Skeeter!
- Hey!
- Just who I wanted to see.
- Hey, chief, here's Bugsy.
- Got him.
- Why do they have to stay here?
Because I'm on call tonight, Jennifer.
It's Jill, actually, Scooter.
It is? OK, yeah...
You did not just do that.
I did. Watch. I'm gonna do it again.
So, guys, anything weird
happen to you today?
I had a substitute
teacher with an eye patch.
Uh... that's a little weird.
I'm talking like big-time weird.
Maybe coincidence weird, uh...
...as in gumball weird?
We're not allowed to chew gum.
Of course you're not. You
guys want to go to sleep?
It's only 5:30.
Hmm. OK.
Room service!
Mom says they rot your brain.
That's not true. I've been playing video
games my whole life, and look at me.
Yeah, maybe she's got a point.
What's bacon?
Bacon is the juicy,
fatty part of the pig
right adjacent to the rear.
But delicious and tasty,
not how I just made it sound.
And this is the first
hamburger you've ever eaten?
- What's the verdict? What do you think?
- Life-changing.
- Mom's gonna kill us.
- No, she isn't.
First of all, she's never
gonna find out about this.
And second of all, she used
to eat plenty of hamburgers
when we were growing
up in this very room.
She did?
Looks like Bugsy's eaten a lot of
burgers in the last ten minutes.
Wow!
He keeps going like that, we
could make bacon out of Bugsy.
He's kidding, Bugsy. Take it easy.
I got a, a new story
I want to lay on you.
What do you think of
cowboys and Indians?
Oh, yes, tonight's the night!
I just like cowboys and
Indians 'cause of the conflict.
OK, once upon a time in the Old West,
... there was a farm hand
named Jeremiah Skeets.
He was looking to get
ahead in the world,
Uh, that was my horse.
That wasn't me, everybody.
You mind showing me your finest horse?
come down from mountain
during time of fire, wind.
Many brave warrior walk
trail of moon bear...
OK. Look, I just want to see your
finest horse, not a whole thing there.
- Sorry. I can do it.
- All right.
Screaming Rooster, bring out Ferrari.
Ferrari.
Oh, my.
Oh, my, oh, my!
Look at that.
Whoa!
I would get automatic respect
riding such a beautiful animal,
but I'm afraid that's just
a bit out of my price range.
Tell you what, white bread.
...for free!
Brilliant story. So he
got the Ferrari for free.
A guy getting a free horse?
That's not a good story.
Where's the arc? There's no
arc. I've not learned anything.
Also, you've got a
moral obligation to them.
What are they gonna
walk away from that with?
I didn't know we were doing
an After School Special.
Why can't he do something
a real gentleman would do,
Not a bad idea, munchkin.
OK. So, uh... let's continue.
Oh, please, don't!
- Give us that jewelry.
- You want my pearls? Help! Please!
Yah! Yah! Yah! Whoo!
Oh, my necklace? Here, take it.
Come on, boy!
Here.
What else you got, sweetie?
Help! Help!
Care for a lift, ma'am?
- Yeah.
- Oh!
- Nice horse.
- Oh, what, this old thing?
Now, any of you gentlemen want to
give the nice lady her stuff back?
Not a chance, huh?
Because I beg to differ!
- My hero.
- I like that.
So Jeremiah spirited Miss
Davenport away to safety,
Shall we go drink champagne
in a nearby hot tub?
- Hot tub?
- Mmm.
Uh, yeah. No.
I was saying that because I wanted to
see if you two were paying attention.
What happened was Jeremiah
dropped Miss Davenport off
Ah, no thanks necessary, ma'am.
But I do insist on expressing
my gratitude in some manner.
Fair enough. I'll take...
...$100 million.
The end. Let's hope it works.
Very well written,
brilliantly constructed.
Jeremiah wouldn't take
money for doing a good deed.
Uh... I know Jeremiah a
lot better than you guys.
And believe me, he'd be all
over that. He loves money.
Mmm!
I don't want that. Go
back, rewrite. Rewrite.
Gentlemen don't get paid.
Will you just... Who's
telling the story here?
It should really end more like this.
Well, I must give you some
token of my appreciation.
Oh, no.
Perhaps... a kiss?
Touchdown.
Ow!
What the heck did you do that for?
Because I'm angry.
Go! Let's go!
All right! Yeah!
I didn't do nothing to you!
- The end.
- You know what?
Laugh as much as you
want. I'll take a Ferrari
and a kiss any day of the week.
I'd just like to kiss a Ferrari.
- All right. Good night.
- Good night, Uncle Skeeter.
Good night, home slice.
Thanks for the stories.
You came up with all
the good parts, Bobbi.
Good night, y'all.
You too there, Bugsy.
And them braids look fantastic.
They've taken years off you.
You mind sleeping over? I'm
gonna duck out a few hours.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Mmm. By the way, um,
I am, uh, legally obliged to tell you
that I suffer from...
sleep panic disorder.
OK, what's, uh, sleep panic disorder?
What am I thinking? Why would
anyone give me a free Ferrari?
I must be losing my mind.
Much power of the horse
underneath that hood.
Hello.
Are you the guy I'm supposed to see?
I'm here, aren't I?
So... am I about to get
a cherry red Ferrari?
I don't see why not.
For... free?
Sounds good to... me!
What do I do now? Eat
a gumball or something?
Yes.
- Fell out of the sky, right?
- Yeah.
Shh!
Oh! Shh.
I won't tell nobody.
Now, close your eyes and count to three.
- OK.
- Then it's all gonna happen.
- No.
- Yeah.
- One, two...
- Yeah.
...three.
Ferrari!
Hey! My wallet!
Not anymore!
Excuse me. Hi, boys.
OK, thank you.
Thanks, guys. Sorry. I'm
just trying to find my car.
Good thing my wallet only
had three dollars in it.
And my Derek Jeter baseball card!
Guys, guys, stop, please.
Stop!
Come on, man!
- Care for a lift, ma'am?
- Skeeter?
- Skeeter Bronson?
- Yes, ma'am.
What do you say you boys
give the pretty lady back
the pictures you took?
Sure about that, now?
Because I beg to differ.
Guy's got a gun!
I'm just happy they didn't
make me use this thing.
- My hero.
- Really?
That was brilliant, Skeeter.
I don't know what happened.
Something came over me.
It felt good. It felt really good.
Hmm.
No thanks is necessary, ma'am?
Oh, am I in the presence of a gentleman?
At your service, ma'am.
Well, I must show my
appreciation in some form.
Ow!
Consider yourself big
people-bashed, sucker.
I knew you were gonna show up.
Get in the Gremlin, Jimmy,
before Sasquatch calls the cops.
Yeah, 'cause that's how
we do what we do. Right?
That's what you get, buddy.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Let's go! Yeah!
Pull me in. Let's get
out of here. Pull me in!
Big people stink!
Indeed. And on that strange
note, I bid you good night.
Yes, yes.
Oh! Oh!
All right, so that's how I'm getting it.
- Getting what?
- This is just... I shouldn't.
I, I couldn't. You know what?
I can. I'm gonna take it.
What are you talking about?
who wants to give her rescuer
a cherry red Ferrari...
...for free!
This is sick!
Well, uh, good luck with
that. I'm just going to go.
What do you mean?
Am I, am I supposed to
follow you or something?
So seriously, no, no Ferrari?
Where's the $100 million, at least?!
Boo!
Hey, hey, hey! Get your
own campaign vehicle.
Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hey, Aunt Jill.
Hey, guys. How did last night go?
An angry dwarf kicked me in the
leg, and I didn't get a free Ferrari.
So there you go.
Oh. How sad.
- He's talking about our bedtime story.
- Oh.
Uncle Skeeter said Jeremiah
would get a new horse and a kiss,
but I said the dwarf would kick him.
You said it.
Maybe that's how it works.
The kids control the stories.
And there are the wind chimes.
You know what that means.
What what means?
Huh?
Nothing. Don't worry about it.
I won't.
OK, guys. Um, what is Bugsy doing?
Working off the hamburgers
he ate last night.
but I gave the children
that wheat germ stuff
I guess it's, uh, Bugsy
watching the TV then too?
Yeah, I flipped that on
and, look, he's glued to it.
I'm innocent!
What was that?
Uh... that was the sleep
panic disorder, I believe.
Why don't we, uh, get out of
here before the next attack.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Give your uncle a kiss.
I'm a relative, I
deserve it. Right there.
Oh, that felt nice.
How about one more for the road?
- No.
- Come on, baby!
Don't worry, we'll be back tonight.
Yeah, no, I'm not worried.
You're coming back, we
got a big story tonight!
About some hotel theme ideas! Yeah!
- Maybe we won't come back.
- What?
- Skeeter?
- Sir Butt-Kiss. Sir... Kendall.
I understand that you feel a need to
prepare for our little... showdown.
- Yeah.
- That does not excuse you
from maintenance responsibilities.
- Oh, no. Check.
- Lights are out in the spa.
- The south service elevator is slow.
- Check.
Let me try that cheesecake.
Oh, another thing.
I heard about your big hero act
with my girlfriend last night.
- This paparazzi was...
- I know what it is you're trying to do,
and it's not gonna work.
to cozy up to the old man
because I'm here to tell you
Violet Nottingham is not gonna
date a gum-scraping handyman.
Hey, Kendall.
Two things. First off, you
got something right there.
Yeah, now, use your hands.
That's disturbing to see.
Good. Secondly, when I get
the job at the new hotel,
I was actually considering keeping
you on, so watch your tone with me.
Your brief little trip to
the land of make-believe
We all know your failed father
ran this hotel into the ground,
and thankfully, you will
not get the chance to make
May want to pick that up.
- It's Duncan.
- Lover, hello.
I'm looking for the hotel site.
The address you gave me is no
good. There's a school here.
- Oh, what school?
- Webster Elementary School.
- Oh, then you're in the right place.
- Is that so?
- This school is being shut down.
- Uh-huh.
The old man pulled a few strings
at the board of education.
- Really?
- We start demolition immediately.
Skeeter? Hey, it's Wendy.
- Hey, sissy.
- Hey. How's it going?
- Are the kids OK?
- Oh, yeah. We're having a blast.
but Uncle Skeeter can jump
over the couch the long way.
- Skeeter, can I talk to them?
- No, I'm taking them camping.
- No.
- Have fun in Arizona. Bye!
Camping? No, Skeeter,
they could get poison ivy!
- Let's go. Quietly.
- Where are we going?
- Someplace special, fools.
- Whoo-hoo!
Now march, march, march, march...
March, march, march...
- Whoo-hoo!
- March, let's go.
Whoa! Cool!
We're going to have
ourselves a camp-out.
You guys, look what he's
done! Isn't this cool?
- See? See how nice I am?
- Yeah.
Whoa, OK, just be
careful around the fire.
Hey, Jill. Shh. Don't want
everyone to hear we're here.
I heard about marshmallows.
Saw them in magazines.
I never imagined they
would be this good.
Let's just hope your mother
doesn't find out I gave you any.
- I won't tell her.
- I'm not talking about you.
She's the weak link.
I think I can let this one slide.
Ahh! The mermaid's
being cool. Look at that.
- The what?
- The nothing.
You know, when we were younger and
your mom and I were out on the roof,
my dad would always tell
us to look at the stars
and see if you could make something
out of them. All right, like, uh...
Right over there. Right
over there. Look, look.
To me, that looks like a camel.
You see the humps? Huh?
The tongue hanging out?
Oh, yeah. I see that.
Yeah! Hey, good one, Patrick.
Look, right next to the
moon. Right, right beside it.
It looks exactly like Bugsy.
Oh, my God!
Don't worry, Bugsy. Your
eyes are still bigger.
Uncle Skeeter?
Yes, good-looking.
Do you think my father will come back?
Um... Well, that's a tough one.
He must be going through
some... mental malfunction
to not want to be with you two
guys every second of the day.
But, uh, I do know this.
You're always gonna have
this girl to hang out with.
OK?
I'm like the stink on your
feet. I'll always be around.
OK. You guys made me
late. I hope you're happy.
Well, thank you. Have
fun at night school.
See you tomorrow.
All right, we got rid of
her, so let's get to business.
Put the s'mores down. Story time.
All right, guys. Tonight's
story's gonna be extra special.
It's called...
Yeah!
- What?
- Boring.
Come on, guys, I really
need you to do this.
It's gonna help my life a lot. Please?
All right, you know what?
We still got one more night.
Let's have a fun story.
Racing, jumping, flying...
Or maybe something like romantic?
Let's combine the action and the romance
and make a romaction story.
- Yeah.
- Let us begin.
The greatest of all the
heroes in ancient Greece
was, of course, Skeetacus.
yet totally underrated and
had been ignored for years.
Finally Skeetacus had his chance to
show his skills in the grand arena.
If he could impress the
daughter of the emperor,
- Skeetacus, Skeetacus!
- Go on, Skeetacus!
That's pretty fancy chariot work.
For a peasant.
Whoo!
Oh, wh... what is he doing?
Whoa!
Bring on the elephants!
- Whoa.
- Ooh.
All right.
Now that's first class.
Hey!
- Bravo!
- Wow.
Can you dig it?
Skeetacus!
How we doing so far, huh?
- This is the best story yet.
- Can we get to the romance now?
Does Skeetacus get
the girl he was after?
the hero always gets the
fairest maiden in the land.
Yes! You said it! OK,
so it's gonna happen!
Uh, right. So, what? They're
thirsty? They go off for drinks?
A little wine and cheese action? Yes?
Yeah, they can go to an old
tavern. And guess who's there?
Led Zeppelin. Say Led Zeppelin, please.
No. All the girls that were
mean to Skeetacus growing up.
What? Nobody was mean
to Skeetacus growing up.
He was like the coolest guy in school.
That's not what Mom said.
All right, everybody
was mean to Skeetacus.
He had problems. All
right, tell your story.
Oh, my God...
They just start nervously
doing the hokey-pokey.
OK.
Skeetacus takes his
date out to the beach.
He had something stuck in his
throat, and he wasn't breathing.
- Thanks.
- He's OK.
And then it starts pouring, so
they run into a magical cave.
- Caves are nice.
- And Abe Lincoln's there.
Abe Lincoln? What,
is this a joke to you?
What the heck's the matter
with you? Oh, I'm sorry.
I, I didn't mean to yell.
The Abe Lincoln thing,
that's, that's a good idea.
It's just that, uh...
Does Skeetacus get a kiss?
Don't you think he should?
It's... been a long time for him.
His lips are very dry
from not using them.
Bugsy, you with me?
We'll see.
- Hello?
- Mmm.
Hey, is this the fairest
maiden in the land?
Mr. Skeeter Bronson, is that you?
Yes, it is. Sorry about that
Ferrari confusion the other night.
I'm here at the beach right now and
I had a hunch you might be here too.
What do you say we
get a little lunchsky?
But I can't. I'm afraid I'm
on my way to Vegas for the day.
Vegas?
Uh, no one talked about Vegas.
Don't tell Kendall. He
thinks I'm in the library.
Yeah, no. But, but, uh, princess,
I, I really thought we
were gonna hang out today.
Oh, well. I will see you
at Daddy's birthday party.
Hmm.
So our date's gonna be
tomorrow? I can live with that.
Hey! Look out! Look out!
Sorry. Are you OK? Hey! I'm so sorry!
What is it about the cushion
of protection you don't like?
Aren't you supposed to be in school?
I'm supposed to be
looking for a job now,
but for some reason I felt
like coming to the beach today.
Huh.
Um, are you hungry?
Yes, I'm always hungry when I'm in pain.
Good. Because I'm buying.
I'll let you buy me lunch.
Somebody stole my wallet,
- so how was I gonna pay?
- Of course you got your wallet stolen.
- I don't know what that means.
- You. It's always something with you.
- Huh?
- You're wearing my hat.
- Gonna wear that all day?
- I'm not wearing nobody's hat.
- I'm wearing your hat! Oh!
- I'll take it back. Thanks.
This is perfect for your free lunch.
Oh, my gosh. You guys, you
guys, you guys. Over there.
Is that... is that Skeeter Bronson?
- Stop it.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
- Skeeter.
Hey! Do you remember me?
It's Donna Hynde from high school.
Yeah, I do.
Thought I was going to run into
you shortly. And here you are.
Yeah. Wow, this is so... weird. Uh...
We were just planning
our high school reunion.
We were totally just talking
about you. It's so weird.
I was just talking about you guys too.
Sure, he was.
Mind pretending to be my
girlfriend for a second?
Yeah, I don't feel
comfortable doing that.
- OK, I'll do it.
- Ding-dong.
Uh, this is my girlfriend,
guys. This is Jill.
Hello.
She's your girlfriend?
Yeah. Yeah.
Yes, I am.
- Right?
- Yup.
She thinks I'm...
You want me to... Oh. Uh... romantic.
She likes how romantic I can be.
And, uh, "great kisser,"
she likes to say.
Oh, yeah. That's... a little too much.
- Oh. Sorry.
- Wow, you are really pretty.
- I mean, she's all right.
- Thanks.
So super skinny.
Skinnier than you. But... Yeah.
I feel really awful
saying this out loud.
We were really terrible to Skeeter
in high school. Awful. So mean.
My Skeeter?
- They were.
- You had a hard time in high school?
Look at you now. You
turned out pretty... cute.
- Yeah!
- You know...
the pimples went away,
and, uh, these came to play.
- You want to touch them?
- Oh, that's OK.
- Later, later.
- They're here for you. Ding-dong.
- And you shake it all about
- OK.
- I think we should leave.
- Yes.
- All right. Bye-bye.
- That's what it's all about
What's happening?
Hey, so I spoke to Wendy.
She's excited to see the kids tomorrow.
This is the longest
she's been away from them.
That's right. This is my
last night with the kids.
They worship you
and those amazing bedtime
stories you've been telling them.
Oh, well, they say all
the good parts. I promise.
Oh, my gosh. Is he unconscious?
Yeah, yeah.
Boom! Oh.
Thanks!
Whoa!
- Yeah?
- Check out Mr. Smooth.
Well, you know, I do what I do.
- Think we should get out of this rain?
- What rain?
Oh, shoot! Where did that come from?
I don't know! Isn't it amazing?
- Let's get out of this!
- Let's go! Let's get out! Move it!
I can read the future.
Good God. So...
So... The big presentation's
tomorrow, right?
I know you're not nervous
or anything, but, um...
good luck on it anyway.
- Thank you.
- Yep.
Actually, you can come if
you want. It's like a party.
You know, Wendy's gonna
be watching the kids,
You can meet me there.
Yeah. That would, uh...
I could do that. I could meet you, um...
...after night school or something.
It's you?
It's me what?
You're the fairest maiden in the land?
"Fair" as in "doesn't
cheat at checkers"?
No, fairest as in...
..."beautifulest."
Wait, wait. Something
weird's gonna happen.
Oh.
No, yeah, we don't... This is a mistake.
No, no, no, not between
us. I mean like, some...
No! No, no! Oh, here comes Abe!
No!
Ah! Look.
- Wow, a penny.
- No, no, no.
This is the weird thing I was
talking about. Abe Lincoln.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No, no, no, no.
Abe's not gonna interrupt
this time. That was it.
It's supposed to end better than this.
Stick around. I'm tellin' ya,
you're gonna be missing out.
Nice imagination, Patrick.
- Skeeter?
- Yo.
We've got a little bit of a
shaving situation in there.
Oh, no, no, no. I took
the razor blades out.
Don't worry. Their father ain't around,
I figured someone has to
teach them how to shave.
I'm Princess Leia.
Uh-huh.
So, are you ready for the
big showdown tomorrow night?
Oh, yeah.
What I'm going to do is
tell them a bedtime story tonight.
Then I'll win for reals. Do you dig?
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, I understand.
So it's like, um,
positive visualization.
I read a book on that once.
I can't read.
Shut up, Bugsy!
I've got opposable thumbs.
How do you feel about that?
You children ready?
Because here comes our last story.
hung in the balance,
as the Supreme Galactic Council
the new planet in the vast
Nottinghamian star system.
Most in attendance expected
Supreme Leader Barracto
Lieutenant Jilli and
her two young cadets,
Aspenoff, and even the
great Captain Bugzoid.
Hey, since it's outer space, Skeeto
should talk like a goofy alien.
That's disgusting. I'm not
going to translate that.
Silence!
The leader of the new planet
shall be determined
the old-fashioned way:
OK, now we get to the
part the crowd came to see.
I think we need to
see them battle first.
- Skeeto!
- But the kids
really want to see Skeeto
kick his butt, right?
Wet willy.
Boring!
Uh, bring out the booger monster!
All right, have the booger
monster smack Kendallo around.
Whoa!
Arise, Skeeto, sharif of Nottinghamia.
- Whoopee!
- Whoo!
And that is the perfect ending
to our last story.
Thank you, children.
Oh, that's not the ending.
What do you mean?
Somebody threw a fireball at Skeeto
and Skeeto got incineratated.
- The end.
- "Incineratated"?
No! No, no! He can't catch on fire.
Yeah. I'm Captain Skeeto. I'm on fire!
No, no, no. The story
can't end like that.
What happened to a nice, happy ending?
You said happy endings
don't really happen.
We want our story to be real.
Oh, I was just saying
that. I was stupid.
No, no, no, no, no.
So, what? We're really going
to have me on fire? Hey!
Don't fall asleep, or the story
will lock. Stop it! Wake up!
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
And I'm sure it's just a
coincidence that the new hotel
is going up right here where
the, where the school is.
Well, I'm pretty sure...
Excuse me. Yeah.
- Good.
- Ten-four, rubber duck.
Got it. Great.
OK. The good news is, you're
going to win the competition.
The bad news is, you're
probably gonna catch on fire,
but not if you take a few precautions.
Yeah.
"Flame-resistant Christmas
tree spray." Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, this will work.
Excuse me. Sir?
Those are actually for Christmas trees.
I know. 'Tis the season.
- Ow! God!
- I'm so sorry.
It burns!
Here, let me make it up to you.
- Ow!
- It's for trees!
It's for trees!
You're right! That hurts!
I'm sorry about that!
Antibacterial wipes, anybody?
Aloha. Aloha.
Thank you so much.
Whoa!
Steady. Steady.
- Kona coffee ice cream.
- Yeah? What's the catch?
You're gonna light it on fire?
'Cause I'm on to you, honey.
No fire. It would melt.
Just take the ice
cream and a chill pill.
- Ah!
- Boo!
- Skeeter.
- Yes.
- That wasn't very nice.
- What wasn't?
- You pushed that man in the pool.
- No, he jumped in.
Hey, you see Jill around?
No, I ain't, I ain't
seen Jill tonight, mate.
Ooh! I am cold.
I'll get you a towel.
- I've got your towel.
- Oh, blimey.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You brought me a grilled
cheese sandwich once.
Yeah. I did, yes.
It was Monterey Jack.
It's a good cheese.
Ow!
Skeeter, are you all right?
A bee stung my tongue!
The meeting for the exciting new hotel
will take place in the living room.
So I don't think you're
going to want to miss this.
No, it's swelling up!
- Can I sit there, please, mate?
- Yes, of course.
- Don't touch me.
- Sorry.
Before we begin, I
would just like to say,
personally, happy birthday.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday, Daddy.
Thank you, Kendall.
Yes, now, as you can see,
to see how your ideas would
play with the "regular folk."
- No offense.
- None taken, Barry. None taken.
So, gentlemen,
which of you would like to go first?
Fair enough.
Mr. Nottingham, you
were absolutely right
when you said the rock
and roll theme was old hat.
Gone. Your insight, sir,
has inspired me to, to dig deeper,
to find the commonality at the heart
of the American experience.
I speak, of course...
...of the musical theater.
And, more specifically...
...Broadway!
Hit it.
There isn't just a
bellhop There's an overture
And you can bring Cats
'cause we take pets
Thank you, Kendall.
Thank you, sir.
Uh, sorry about that.
I was, uh, just resting my eyes.
Skeeter. You're up.
Are you all right, Skeeter?
A bee bit my tongue.
I'm sorry?
A bee... stung my tongue.
"A bee stung my tongue."
Oh, you understand him? Oh.
How did a bee sting your tongue?
Uh...
I was eating ice cream,
and suddenly a bee...
Uh, it was on an ice
cream, and he licked it.
Hmm. Can you translate
Skeeter's presentation for us?
- Mmm!
- Uh... Yes!
Yes, I can do that.
Thank you. Ready?
- I'm ready. OK.
- Ready?
"I spent the last week in the
hotel, the hotel where I live..."
With my niece and nephew.
"With my niece and my nephew."
"To a kid, everything about a
hotel is strange and wonderful."
"Sleeping in a different bed."
"Hanging out in the lobby."
"Jumping up and down on the alligator."
Ah!
Sorry. Yeah, I see now that an alligator
wouldn't be in that context.
"Some hotels try to make it seem
as much like home as possible."
"But they're missing the point."
"If you wanted to stay in a place
like home, then why not stay at home?"
"Our guests should experience
an escape from the everyday."
"And that's what I'd like
to capture in our new hotel."
"What every kid knows and what
every adult has forgotten."
"Like my father said to me,
your fun is only limited
by your imagination."
- That was beautiful.
- Yeah? All right. Settle down.
Just the way it built.
And that's it? I'm sorry.
I don't understand it.
That... was... brilliant!
Congratulations, my boy. You've
just won the keys to the kingdom.
Boogie, don't do that. Germs.
Congratulations. Great
job. Keep icing that tongue.
- All right.
- Congratulations, Skeeter.
- Congratulations. That was great.
- Yeah?
That's just terrific.
Congratulations, Skeeter.
All right, Kendall. Yeah.
No hard feelings, pal.
Of course not. You deserve it.
You're a better man than me.
- You have an iron will.
- Yeah. That's what they say.
I would not have the guts to tear down
the school my niece and nephew attend.
What?
You do know that's the
site for the new hotel?
What are you talking about?
- Good show, old son.
- Oh, sir.
That bee sting language was really
working for you on a sympathetic level.
Good, I'm glad. I wanted to
talk to you about the location
that we're building the hotel.
Bronson, you're fired!
Fired?
Oh...
That's how it connects.
Yes?
Do you know where Jill
Hastings' class is?
Why won't you answer my calls?
Because I know it's you calling.
You got to believe me,
Jill. I had no idea...
Don't destroy the sliver of respect
I have for you by making lame excuses.
Just go away and stay away.
Uncle Skeeter? Do you want
to incinertate our school
'cause we incinertated you in the story?
No, I wouldn't do that.
We thought you were
supposed to be the good guy.
So did I.
"Skeeto defeats Kendallo."
Not really.
- Yeah?
- Hey.
Oh, hey. Welcome back.
So, you mad at me, too?
Not as mad as Jill, but, uh, mad, yes.
I didn't know the new
hotel was going up there.
I figured that.
Then what are you mad at?
No, I figured you'd do that too.
I'm mad because you told my kids
that in real life there
are no happy endings.
Well, look around you, Wendy.
Do you see any happy endings here?
I don't know. You and Dad always
had so much fun in this room.
I was always the cynic,
the, the sourpuss.
The black cloud. The energy drainer.
The... dead fish.
Yes, all of those things.
But when I left Bobbi
and Patrick with you,
I guess I just was hoping
you'd rub off on them.
Get them to be lighter.
Have fun. Enjoy themselves.
I thought Dad would like that.
Anyway, um, I got a job in Arizona.
Teaching, not principaling.
That's cool.
Yeah, well, maybe you can
come visit when we get settled.
I know by then the kids
will really want to see you.
And so Skeeter sat on his
bed, filled with regret,
wondering how to put the
pieces of his life together
- Great ending, huh?
- That was your ending, son?
I thought this was just a sad part,
and you were about to make it better.
What? How could I make it any better?
the hero would do something
unexpected and courageous
to beat the bad guy, save
the day, and get the girl!
Yeah. How can I do that?
But you better get
moving. Go get 'em, son.
Mr. Nottingham! Mr. Nottingham?
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a moment.
My name is Jill Hastings. I'm
a teacher at Webster Elementary.
My men are in position. We
are ready for the demolition.
Excellent. Mr. Nottingham said he'd call
if he had a problem
getting the variance,
so if we don't hear from
him in the next 20 minutes,
I say we just... blow it all up.
Madam, the war is over.
You lost. I'm sorry.
This isn't a war, Mr. Nottingham.
We're talking about children.
There must be other possible
sites for your hotel complex
that would not result
in the displacement...
Hey, hey! Barry, Jill. How you doing?
We're just wrapping up here.
Donna, you remember Jill, right?
Of course! Oh, my God.
That jacket is so cute!
Uh, thank you.
Bronson, what are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
Yeah, what am I doing here?
Oh, uh, well, Mr. Bronson,
as a concerned citizen,
wanted to bring points to my attention
before I made any hasty
decisions about the property.
And they are points that are
going to take me years to analyze.
- Years?
- Years.
Bronson, are you
playing hardball with me?
I am, sir.
Because your application
for variance has been...
Denied.
Denied?
Yes. But the good news is
Donna and I found you
another piece of property
right on the beach in Santa Monica
that is uptight and out of sight.
Beachfront was my first
choice, but it's not for sale.
It is now.
It is! Isn't that fabulous?
Really?
Friends?
Oh, oh. Yeah, well, germs.
Let's get past that.
Come here. Come here.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm touching you, and
it's OK. Look at that.
Aw...
Ooh. You're enjoying it.
Good. Bring me closer.
That is so sweet. And creepy.
Attention, please, ladies and gentlemen.
We are working with highly-sensitive,
dangerous radio-controlled explosives.
Boo!
I would ask that you all
turn off your cell phones.
All of you, please. Turn
your cell phones off.
- Yes?
- We appear to have a situation.
I can't reach Kendall on his cell phone
to halt the demolition which
will begin in... 13 minutes.
This sign we made is awesome!
We need a window where those
construction guys can see it.
Then they'll change their minds.
Bobbi, I found one.
That's my Prius!
- OK. Where's your truck?
- My truck?
What do you mean you
gave it back to the hotel?
Come here! Come here!
It's for a good cause!
No!
Oh, my God!
No, no, no, no!
Ooh! Yah! Booya!
Bobbi! Patrick!
What are you going to do?
I'll take that back.
No fair!
Hey, people, that's
Wait! Wait a minute! I
can't find my children!
- They might be in there!
- Nice try.
We cleared the building hours
ago. OK? Everything is fine.
No! Let me through!
Hey, we got to check the rooms
before we start making booms.
Do it myself.
Uncle Skeeter!
Hey! Get out of there!
- Five...
- No!
- Grab the bar!
- Four...
Three...
Two...
One!
The king has issued a proclamation.
The school will stay.
- Mom!
- Mom!
Bobbi! Patrick!
Oh!
Hey, hey, hey. You
guys underdemeciated me.
Come here! I just got to know you guys.
You think I'm gonna let
you slip away from me now?
I knew you were the good guy.
Yeah.
Uh, Patrick, hi. I'm Trisha Sparks.
I just wanted you to know that...
thanks for saving the school.
Western. Go Western.
- No thanks necessary, ma'am.
- That's my boy. That's my boy.
There must be some way for
me to show my appreciation.
Oh-ho-ho!
Get it.
Ooh!
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Hey, isn't she a little old for you?
- She's hot.
- So is she. What do you think?
If Master Stinky's getting a kiss,
shouldn't, shouldn't I get
a little mermaid action?
- Come on, already.
- Ooh!
Turned his back on the world
of luxury hotel management
And bless his heart, he
even named it after me.
Hey, speaking of s'mores, it
looks like Bugsy ate them all.
We're completely out of marshmallows.
Oh, all right. Let me
handle that. Room service!
- Yes, sir?
- Hi, Kendall.
Uh, Bugsy's out of marshmallows.
If you could just go get him
some, that would be great.
Right on it, sir. Anything else?
Uh, not from you, Kendall, but, uh...
...Housekeeping?
Hey, Aspen.
Could you just make sure
that Bugsy's cage is clean
before he checks out in the morning?
His marshmallows don't agree
with him, there's gonna be a mess.
All right.
OK, bye, guys.

villains are doing now.
