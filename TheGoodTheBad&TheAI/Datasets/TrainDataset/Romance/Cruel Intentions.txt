Sebastian...
Let's try and focus.
What can I say?
I'm a fool.
- You're not a fool.
- I am. A poor little rich boy.
It's not your fault.
Adolescence is a difficult time.
Without great parenting,
things can go awry.
But you have to rise above
their mistakes. Here.
- An autographed copy. For me?
- It's yours.
Stop being so hard on yourself.
What's in the past is over.
You're right.
It's hard to believe there was a
time when I only thought about sex.
It's no way to go through life.
Take yourself, for example.
You're a very attractive woman.
You have killer legs.
I'd love to photograph them...
That was the old me.
I'm cured now.
Same time next week?
I'm going on my book tour.
I'll be back in a month.
- Why?
- Other people need my help, too.
- You'll do just fine.
- I hope so.
If you need anything, just call.
I could use a hug.
All right... There you go.
- Your daughter on 1.
- Tell her to hold.
- Is this her? She seems nice.
- She's great. Straight-A student.
She's attending Princeton this fall.
She's the type of girl
I should be with.
She's a little out of your league.
- Take care of yourself, Sebastian.
- Thank you... for everything.
Shmuck.
- Yes?
- Your daughter's still holding.
- Hi, honey.
- You kept me on hold.
He told me he loved me,
and I believed him.
- I'm so stupid.
- It's all right.
Take a deep breath,
step out of the circle.
Cut the psycho-babble bullshit, Mom!
There's pictures of me
on the Internet.
- What kind of pictures?
- Nudie pictures! What do you think?
- How could you be so stupid?
- He was just so charming.
He said I had killer legs, -
Things just got
completely out of hand.
Mom... Are you there?
Sebastian!
You're going to pay for this,
you little shit!
- You sicko! Pervert!
- What's her problem?
Someone's in need of therapy.
You won't get away with this.
Get away!
- What's your name?
- Clorissa.
- Clorissa? God, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.
- I'm going to take you to lunch.
- Okay.
There's no parking here, sir.
We're so happy that Cecile will be
attending Manchester with you.
You've been an inspiration to us.
We hope she can rise to the
high standards you've set for her.
I'll do my best.
- What was that?
- "Thanks. " Isn't Vietnamese lovely?
Kathryn is very popular at school.
Listen to her and you'll go far.
- Where do you get your strength?
- It sounds corny, but...
When I'm tempted by peer pressure,
I turn to God. He helps me.
- That's beautiful.
- What are the boys like?
Cecile...
Is that all you can think of?
Forgive her. She's never been in
a co-educational atmosphere before.
It's understandable. Most boys
at Manchester are very upstanding.
But there are a few bad apples.
Like your stepbrother Sebastian.
What he did to the school nurse...
I hear she's recovering quite well.
Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell.
- You remember my daughter Cecile?
- My, what an adorable shirt.
My father took me to Australia.
How are things down under?
Blossoming, I hope.
What?
- I'm so sorry...
- Well, thank you for your help.
- I'll call about your curriculum.
- Okay, thanks.
It was nice meeting you.
Let's go. Keep your legs together.
This isn't Jamaica.
I didn't know it was Asshole Day.
I'm just taking the poor girl
under my wing.
The parental units called.
How's your whore of a mother
enjoying Bali?
She suspects that your impotent,
alcoholic dad is diddling the maid.
- Therapy not going well?
- It was fine.
Clorissa. "Call me. "
I'm sick of sleeping with these
insipid Manhattan debutantes.
- Nothing shocks them anymore.
- Relax. I have a mission for you.
- Remember Court Reynolds?
- The Nazi who dumped you July 4th?
I went to great lengths to please
Court. I made huge sacrifices.
My feelings were hurt when I learned
Court had fallen for someone else.
- You don't mean?
- None other than Cecile Caldwell.
So that's what this is all about.
"Keep your enemies close. "
When I'm done with Cecile, she'll
be the premier tramp of New York.
Court's princess
will be damaged goods.
- Why not just attack Court?
- That could be traced back to me.
That won't do. Everyone loves me,
and I intend to keep it that way.
I see your point.
- Why should I care?
- You have to seduce young Cecile.
She's quite cute, you know.
Young, supple breasts.
A tight, firm ass.
Uncharted booty.
Be her Captain Picard, Valmont.
Boldly go...
...where no man has gone before.
I can't.
- Why not?
- Come on, Kathryn. It's too easy.
Get one of your moron friends to
do it. I've a reputation to uphold.
- Diddling the therapist's daughter?
- She was overcharging.
- I know all about menstrual cramps.
- Shut up and turn to page 64.
"Why I plan to wait",
by Annette Hargrove, Kansas City.
- Jesus Christ, is she for real?
- She's Daddy's little angel.
A paradigm of chastity.
Let's see.
Boring, boring, boring...
"I love my parents. "
"Making a mature decision... "
Here!
She has a boyfriend named Trevor.
Going out for a year.
Trevor understands.
Trevor's a fag.
Too bad she lives in Kansas.
Au contraire. The virgin's father
is the new headmaster at our school.
She's staying with my aunt
while her parents sell the house.
Can you imagine what this will do
for my reputation?
Screwing the new headmaster's
daughter before school starts.
- She'll be my greatest victory.
- You don't stand a chance.
- Care to make a wager?
- I'll think about it.
Duty calls. Dr. Greenbaum and her
daughter will be an exciting entry.
Your journal...
Could you be more queer?
Could you be more desperate
to read it?
Sebastian...
Could you come here for a second?
About that little wager of yours...
Count me in.
What are the terms?
If I win...
- Your hot little car is mine.
- And if I win?
You'll get something you've wanted
since our parents got married.
Be more specific.
In English...
I'll fuck your brains out.
What makes you think I'll go for it?
That's a 1956 Jaguar Roadster.
Because I'm the only person
you can't have, and it kills you.
No way.
You can put it anywhere.
You got yourself a bet, baby.
Happy hunting, Sebastian.
Your home is beautiful,
Mrs. Rosemond.
It's been in my family
for over 100 years.
- Does your family ride much?
- My grandpa used to break horses.
- What was that?
- Sebastian must be home.
Pull!
- Sebastian!
- Fuck me...
Aunt Helen!
God, I've missed you!
I've been looking all over for you.
I want you to meet Annette.
Annette Hargrove, this is Sebastian.
- She'll be staying for a few weeks.
- I guess that makes two of us.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
Aunt Helen, why don't you whip up
some of that ice tea of yours?
- Don't get into any trouble.
- We won't.
Come on.
Quickly, lots to see.
I read your manifesto. I must say,
I found it rather appalling.
- Most people praise me for it.
- Most people are sheep.
You criticize something
you've never experienced.
I just believe people shouldn't
make love before they are in love.
People our age aren't mature enough
to know those emotions.
- Are you a lesbian?
- No.
I just picked up on
a little of that lesbian vibe.
I wouldn't expect you
to understand my beliefs.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I know of your reputation.
What have you heard?
That you promise girls the world
to get them in bed with you.
- Who told you this?
- A friend wrote me.
- That's a little tacky.
- It's the truth, isn't it?
If you say so.
That's good.
Let's try the G-major scale.
Once again.
Remember, the third note is sharp.
I suck!
Relax. Take a deep breath.
You're concentrating too much
on your bowing. Let me help you.
Close your eyes.
Mai-lee, be careful!
We've had this discussion.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
Your playing was beautiful.
This is Ronald Clifford.
He'll be teaching me this summer.
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise, I'm sure.
Ronald is attending pre-Juilliard.
He's composing his first opera.
- It's based on Martin Luther King.
- Dr. King is my favorite.
I guess our hour's up.
Same time tomorrow?
Bye.
Unbelievable.
Some fag, no offence, -
- wrote a letter to this chick
describing my tactics.
- Any idea who it could be?
- If I did, the person would suffer.
- Where is the little girl from?
- Kansas. Who do I know in Kansas?
- Greg McConnell.
- The football stud?
I wouldn't be surprised
if he was your rat.
He hates me. I fingered his
girlfriend at Homecoming last year.
- I don't think that bothered him.
- What do you mean?
Greg likes to tackle tight ends
on and off the field.
- You're shitting me.
- I shit you not.
He used to sneak into my dorm drunk.
As soon as he'd come
he'd freak out:
"What are you doing? I'm not a fag.
If you tell, I'll kick your ass!"
I only put up with it because
the man has a mouth like a Hoover.
- Too bad he's in Kansas.
- Not anymore.
The football team started practice
last week.
- We've already had a session.
- Good for you.
Could you arrange a get-together
with him tonight?
"Spartacus" is on TV tonight.
- Outstanding.
- But it'll cost you.
Just make sure
your front door is unlocked.
Shall we say the stroke of midnight,
no pun intended?
The stroke of midnight it is.
I take out my dick
and I shove it right in her face.
I'm like, "Suck it, you dumb bitch. "
- The Gregster.
- Yes, the Gregster.
- Gregory?
- Hi, Blaine.
I hear you went on a date with
Court Reynolds. I hear he's nice.
He kept talking about this bulimic
headcase he dumped on July 4th.
- Bulimic headcase?
- What a loser she must be.
Sorry.
Court's invited me to the Hamptons
for Labor Day weekend.
- That's great.
- You think so?
- I guess I'm just scared.
- Of what?
Boys. I've never even got
to first base with a guy.
Haven't you practiced
on a girlfriend?
- No, that's gross.
- How do you think girls learn?
Close your eyes and wet your lips.
- Are you for real?
- Do you want to learn?
I guess.
- That wasn't so scary.
- It was nothing.
Let's try it again. This time I'll
stick my tongue in your mouth.
Massage my tongue with yours.
That's what first base is.
- Okay.
- Eyes closed.
- Not bad.
- That was cool.
Maybe you should try it
on your friend Ronald sometime.
- What are you saying?
- It's obvious he's crazy about you.
He sends me love letters.
- How romantic. Have you responded?
- No.
- Don't you like him?
- I think about him all the time.
If my mom found out she'd kill me.
- You did hide the letters, right?
- In an antique doll's house.
- Bring me copies of the letters.
- Why?
I'm great at love letters.
I'll have him eating
out of the palm of your hand.
- Maybe you can meet at my house.
- You'd do that for me?
- Of course. We're friends, right?
- Best friends.
Do you want to have a sleepover?
Hello?
Excuse me...
- Excuse me...
- What a pleasant surprise.
- The music's playing in every room.
- It's not, just yours.
I thought you'd be pleased.
- What are you doing in your room?
- Reading.
- Anything interesting?
- Yes, it's quite intriguing.
For you.
Something to start
the new school year with.
- You didn't have to do this.
- You hate it.
- You just didn't have to do it.
- Can you join me for a swim?
It is ten o'clock,
but we are reasonably young.
Your proposal's only mildly
insulting, so I'll consider it.
Give me a minute.
- Fuck her yet?
- I'm working on it.
Call me later.
Sebastian?
Would you mind turning around
so I can put on my bathing suit?
This is so embarrassing...
It amazes me someone as charming
as you can be so manipulative.
You're not going to start again?
What was my favorite part?
"He has never uttered a single word
without some dishonorable intent. "
"Every woman he has pursued has
regretted it. Stay away from him. "
You could at least have the decency
to tell me who's bad-mouthing me.
Not a chance.
You're right...
about what you said today.
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.
- I'm not giving you a hard time.
- It's okay.
Look at you,
with all your morals and values...
You seem to be happy in your
choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Seriously.
You've got everything going for you.
You're smart,
you're beautiful, you're determined.
You're everything I want
in a girlfriend.
You know I'm seeing someone?
Yes, the infamous Trevor. It's funny
how you haven't mentioned him.
He's backpacking through Europe.
He's great. I really miss him.
- I care.
- I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
Honestly?
"You're smart,
you're beautiful... determined. "
That won't get you anywhere.
The best you can hope for
is my friendship.
Good night, sweet pea.
- Oh, baby...
- "Baby"?
Right on time.
- Shit! Give me my underwear.
- Don't get so huffy.
What do we have here?
Look, Valmont, it's the first time
I've ever done anything like this.
- I was just...
- Really drunk and blah-blah-blah.
Please don't tell anyone.
This could ruin my whole career.
Your career?
Greg, what about your family?
Wouldn't your dad be humiliated to
find out his son's a fudge-packer?
I'll do anything. Let's just
forget about this whole thing, okay?
No. I can't help you there. You're
bad-mouthing me to Annette Hargrove.
What are you talking about?
You're the only one who knows her.
I never said a word to her
about you.
He's probably telling you the truth.
The man can barely write out
a grocery list, let alone a letter.
All right... I believe you.
Your secret's safe with me.
Actually, there is something
you can do for me.
- What else do you know about him?
- Well, he's smart as hell.
He's dedicated to achieving his
goals. He always gives 110 percent.
He's always watched my back.
He's got a bad rep,
but it's mostly bullshit.
I've heard awful things about him.
- From who?
- I'm sworn to secrecy.
- How long have we known each other?
- Forever.
It's my job to look out for you.
You're like a sister to me.
Do I look like a gossip queen?
It's me. Greg.
The Gregster.
I'm serious.
- You swear not to tell anybody?
- I swear on my momma's life.
That nosy bitch. Are you sure?
She said "Mrs. Caldwell".
They met at orientation.
- Did you do what I asked you to?
- Yeah.
- She bought it?
- I'm pretty sure.
- Pretty sure, or sure-sure?
- She bought it.
- even though I told her
that I could do this.
My best friends Sue, Kelly
and Frances knew I could do it.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You would not believe...
- It's my mom.
- I should get going.
- See you tomorrow?
- Absolutely.
- Goodbye.
- Peace out.
"Peace out"? Moron.
- Okay, what's wrong with you?
- Are you ready for this?
I've discovered that Mrs. Caldwell
urged Annette to stay away from me.
- Interesting.
- Yes, it is.
I now plan to devote all my energy
to destroying the douchebag.
The plot thickens. Cecile
has fallen for her music teacher.
Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
But Don Juan moves with the speed
of a Special Olympic hurdler.
What's your plan of attack?
I rat Cecile out to Mommy, who goes
ballistic and ends the relationship.
But who will they turn to for help?
Cecile is going away with Court
next week.
I need you to speed up
her sexual awakening.
- I'm at your service.
- Thank you.
- That feels good.
- Sis, you're so tense.
I know...
I hate it
when things don't go my way.
It makes me so horny.
I hate it, too.
It seems like things
are looking up for you.
It appears so.
- Any luck with your girl?
- Moving along quite well.
- Have you succeeded in your task?
- Any day now.
Well, let me know when you do.
Until then...
Down, boy!
Come on!
Hi, it's Sebastian.
I didn't wake you, did I?
No, not at all.
- Did I leave my glasses there?
- No, I don't think so.
All right.
I guess I'll see you around.
- Is that really why you called?
- No.
- I miss talking to you.
- A moment of honesty.
- Well, I'm not liking it too much.
- What are you doing tomorrow?
I came as quick as I could.
What's wrong?
It's Cecile.
- You promise not to say anything?
- Yes. It isn't drugs, is it?
It's worse.
I think there's something between
Cecile and her music teacher.
- Ronald? That's crazy.
- Yes, she's so young, he's so...
Black!
Brown sugar... no sugar.
He's sent her love letters,
they're under her doll's house.
Something like this could destroy
her reputation at Manchester.
I hope I was right to tell you. I'd
hate to see her ruin it with Court.
- I can't thank you enough.
- You will be discreet?
Absolutely.
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Excuse me?
I'm not paying you
to pervert my child.
I think you're
misunderstanding something.
Care to explain this, then?
- Where did you find those?
- Margarita did, when cleaning.
Go to your room... Now!
How dare you disrespect me?
I got you off the streets.
The streets?
I live at 59th and Park.
Whatever. You are never to set foot
in this house again, -
- and you are never to see
my daughter again. Understood?
First of all,
I never touched your daughter.
Second, I'd like to think
you could look beyond racial lines.
Don't give me that racist crap.
We gave money to Colin Powell.
I guess that puts me in my place.
Thank you for your hospitality.
It was a true awakening.
The black man is gone!
Praise Jesus,
the black man is gone!
- I never knew she felt this way.
- You're a lucky guy.
- What do I do?
- Tell her you love her.
Mrs. Caldwell will have me shot
if I go near her.
I don't even know
her e-mail address.
E- mail is for geeks and paedophiles.
Be romantic, write another letter.
- How will it get to her?
- We'll make sure she gets it.
- Why are you doing this for me?
- Because...
We want to see Cecile happy.
We know that you'd make her happy.
You'd make any girl happy.
You mind if I have some privacy?
My room's across the hall.
Make yourself at home.
- Who are you calling?
- Cecile.
- What are you doing?
- You know the damage we'll cause?
I'm aware.
Are you really? We've done
some fucked-up shit, but this is...
We're destroying an innocent girl.
Court Reynolds is going down. If you
won't help me, someone else will.
- You amaze me.
- Eat me, Sebastian.
You guys can fuck everyone, but I
get dumped for twits like Cecile.
God forbid I exude confidence
and enjoy sex.
I must act like Mary Sunshine 24-7
so I can be considered a lady.
I'm the Marcia Brady of the
East Side and I want to kill myself.
There's your psychoanalysis,
Dr. Freud.
Now tell me,
are you in, or are you out?
Call her.
It's Kathryn.
Okay, stop crying.
Stop crying.
Hold on for Sebastian.
Cecile?
Stop crying.
Listen to me very carefully.
I have a letter from Ronald.
He asked me to give it to you.
I can't bring it to your house, your
mother despises me, so listen...
Finished.
- This doesn't taste like ice tea.
- It's from Long Island.
- How's the letter?
- It's excellent.
- Do you think he'll like it?
- He'll love it. Are you kidding?
- What are you doing?
- Just taking a photo.
- You know, you could be a model.
- Really?
Too bad you're not sexy.
- I can be sexy.
- All right, show me sexy.
Wow, that's very sexy.
Make yourself more comfortable.
No, no. Come here.
Cecile, you know
what would be super-duper sexy?
If you lost all the clothes.
- I don't think so.
- Sorry, that was out of line.
- I think I should go home now.
- I'll have your mom pick you up.
You can't call my mom.
Wow, she doesn't know you're here.
In fact, you're probably grounded.
- I think I should call her anyway.
- I'll do anything. Don't call!
Cecile...
All I want to do is give you a kiss.
Just a kiss?
I swear.
- What are you doing?
- You promised to let me kiss you.
- But then why...
- I don't want to kiss you here.
I want to kiss you there.
- A promise is a promise, Cecile.
- A promise is a promise...
It tickles.
Cecile, are you up yet?
You're going to be late for the...
- Cecile?
- I need a hug.
- Cecile?
- Yeah.
- Jesus, where have you been?
- Shopping.
Hurry up. You're supposed to be
at Mrs. Rosemond's before brunch.
She's very important at the school,
and I want you to look your best.
- Afternoon, ladies.
- I didn't know you'd be here.
Why waste such a lovely day
in the city?
- Good point.
- Anyone for tennis?
Excuse me.
That was rude.
She's very strange.
- What am I going to do?
- Is something wrong?
Mrs. Collins is short of volunteers
at the retirement home.
- But I have theatre tickets.
- That's terrible.
I have a thought.
Why don't you two fill in for me?
- I'd love to.
- You two are the best.
- Thank you. It's so sweet of you.
- I can't help it.
Isn't he beautiful? It's wonderful
when you young people help out.
Most of our patients
have no family nearby.
Mr. Gottlieb,
we have a visitor for you.
No, I've got somebody special
for you, baby.
Did I ever tell you the time
when my late husband...
Yes, Mrs. Sugerman, you did.
Right after we played backgammon.
- We played backgammon?
- You beat me three times.
- Then I fucked your daughter.
- Excuse me?
- I said, "Care for some water?"
- No, thank you.
- Come in.
- How's it going in here?
We played backgammon,
and I won three times.
- That's the way to go!
- Isn't it wonderful?
I told you she was special.
That was fun.
I actually feel good about myself.
Mrs. Sugerman is cool.
Come on.
Mrs. Sugerman is cool?
- You must think I'm an idiot.
- No.
- You had a good time with her?
- I did. We played backgammon.
All right, I was bored out of
my mind. I hate doing charity.
It's okay.
That doesn't make you a bad person.
- I can't win with you.
- It's not about winning, Sebastian.
Your problem is,
you take yourself too seriously.
- I do not.
- Yes, you do. Try to lighten up.
I am.
Can we drop this?
What are you doing?
Stop it. It's distracting.
Cut it out.
Stop it.
- Are you smiling?
- No.
Will you stop!
You can relax.
I promise I won't tell anybody.
- Who is it?
- It's Kathryn.
- Are you okay?
- No!
What's wrong?
- Something bad happened last night.
- What do you mean?
- I don't think you want to know.
- Cecile, you have to tell me.
It involves your brother.
He... He took advantage of me.
- Why didn't you do something?
- I don't know.
You came to our house late at night,
and he forced intercourse on you.
Not exactly.
- He made you give him a blowjob?
- No...
What, then?
He took down my panties and
wrote the alphabet with his tongue.
- He went down on you?
- If that's what you call it.
- Well, did you like it?
- No.
I don't know, it was weird.
At first it felt icky, -
- and then it was sort of okay.
Then I started getting really hot,
and then I started shaking...
It was weird,
it just felt like an explosion...
- But a good one.
- Cecile, you had an orgasm.
- I did?
- You're becoming a woman.
- I am?
- Cecile!
Now that you're on your way,
it would be stupid of you to stop.
Think of Sebastian as a tutor.
Let him instruct you.
But I don't love him.
I love Ronald.
Don't you want to make Ronald happy?
Practice makes perfect, Cecile.
My advice is to sleep with
as many people as possible.
That would make me a slut...
Wouldn't it?
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just
that nobody talks about it.
- Like a secret society?
- That's one way of looking at it.
- Fucking idiot...
- Cool.
Secret society, secret society...
- Am I supposed to feel this sore?
- Just the first time. It'll pass.
I like it better when I'm on top.
Cecile...
This is what I call "quiet time",
when we reflect on what we've done.
Sorry.
- Something's the matter?
- You think?
- Is it me?
- No, you were fine.
It's that Annette girl.
You love her, don't you?
It's okay. I don't love you, either.
I love Ronald.
- Where are you going?
- I'm taking a shower.
- Want company?
- No.
- Want a blowjob?
- Good night, Cecile.
Prude...
Who are you spying on?
- Is that her?
- Yeah.
She's crying. Little baby's upset
by the big bad book.
- Shut up.
- What's up your ass?
Nothing.
- She's getting to you, isn't she?
- If you must know, yes.
I can't stand her holy bullshit,
yet I'm totally infatuated with her.
She made me laugh.
That's why you're losing our bet?
No. It's just taking longer
than I expected.
Do you mind if I take
my new car for a ride?
Kathryn... The only thing
you're going to be riding is me.
If you'll excuse me,
I have some work to do.
- Bonjour, mademoiselle.
- Bonjour, monsieur Valmont.
- I'm sorry about that.
- I am too.
- You know what? I'm not sorry.
- I thought we'd just be friends.
I can't keep my feelings
all bottled up like you.
Do you honestly feel nothing for me?
- I have feelings for you.
- Then what's wrong?
It's not like you have a husband,
unless you're married to Jesus.
- Why can't we be together?
- Do you really want to know why?
It's because
I don't trust myself with you.
Come in.
- I just came to say goodbye.
- Where are you going?
Back to the city. Maybe to France
for the end of the summer.
- I can't take your games anymore.
- What games?
Come off it. You're hot one minute,
cold the next...
- You make me feel inadequate.
- Then I guess it's best you leave.
Sebastian... I don't want us
to part on bad terms.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice
in the matter.
- I don't associate with hypocrites.
- How am I a hypocrite?
You spend all your time preaching
about waiting for love.
Now you're turning your back on it.
So I guess we're just fucked.
I'll move on, but you'll always know
that you turned your back on love.
That makes you a hypocrite.
Have a nice life.
Wait...
I'm sorry, I can't.
Get it together, you pussy.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- So, how did it go last night?
- With who?
Not Cecile, I know all about that.
No, I didn't nail her.
- She shot you down?
- Exactly the opposite.
What went wrong?
I don't know.
She was lying on the bed,
ready to do it, and I was...
- I just didn't feel right about it.
- You had your chance, and didn't?
- She's not in her room.
- Where is she?
She left 30 minutes ago.
Where did she go?
She told your aunt
she was going to stay with friends.
You blew it.
That girl's come to her senses.
She'll never go near you again.
Stupid, stupid...
"Judy". I'll save that one.
It's Valmont. Is she with you?
No, I don't know where she is.
Why don't you leave her alone?
- Where is she?
- She's staying with the Mihallaks.
She caught a train into Penn Station
about 20 minutes ago.
- I'm impressed.
- I'm in love.
Are you okay?
Just a minute.
Come in.
- Bad time?
- Kind of.
You invited me in so I could witness
your little adventure.
Who is our friend
who gives you such pleasure?
Where could he be?
- Fucked-up shit in this house...
- Call me.
You don't get to have all the fun.
I assume you've come here
to make arrangements.
Some other time.
- Excuse me?
- I'm not in the mood.
- I want to fuck.
- And I don't.
Good afternoon, Kathryn.
Sounds great.
I love you, too.
"I love you, too... "
You're completely pussy-whipped.
- Stop it.
- What happened to us?
- Nothing has changed.
- Yes, it has.
- You don't love me anymore.
- Come on, it's just a bet.
- This is ridiculous.
- You're ridiculous, dear brother.
Look what you've been reduced to.
What'll happen when school starts?
You're dating Miss Seventeen
Magazine, the headmaster's daughter.
Before you know it, you'll be
giving campus tours with her.
Her father doesn't know
about your past, does he?
I doubt he'd let his little princess
be seen with you.
It's disappointing to see Annette's
manifesto was a total sham.
As student body president,
I feel it's my duty to tell him.
- Put the phone down.
- This won't take a second.
Quite the predicament you're in.
I was planning on telling her
everything this afternoon.
That's right, I forgot.
You're so in love.
You honestly believe you've changed
in the few days you've known her?
Let me tell you something.
People don't change overnight.
You and I are two of a kind.
I'm not afraid to admit it.
You were going to leave school
a legend, now you'll leave a joke.
- I'm willing to take my chances.
- Don't do it, Sebastian.
You won't only ruin your reputation,
you'll destroy hers.
This is my room.
Can we be quiet?
- I have something to tell you.
- Tell me.
- This isn't working out for me.
- Yeah, me neither.
- What's wrong?
- It's me. I'm completely fucked up.
What are you saying?
I thought I was in love with you,
but it was just a lie.
I wanted it to work,
but unfortunately I feel nothing.
- Why are you doing this?
- I wanted to get you into bed.
You don't mean that.
You know nothing.
You don't even know me.
The fact is,
there is someone I love.
- You don't even compare to her.
- I don't believe you.
I don't know how to make it clearer.
You mean nothing to me.
You were just...
You were just a conquest.
You're such a coward.
Look, you're shaking.
- Is that what you came to tell me?
- I'm sorry. I'm completely...
You're completely fucked up.
Get out.
Get out!
Don't touch me...
Don't touch me.
Don't fucking touch me, Sebastian!
Just leave.
Jesus...
A bit melodramatic, don't you think?
I thought you'd like to know
what happened with Annette.
It's over.
- Really?
- You were right.
I can't change.
You and I are two of a kind.
- I thought we should celebrate.
- Sorry. I'm expecting some company.
- Who? Ronald?
- Not that it concerns you, but yes.
From Ronald.
I haven't had a chance to read it, -
- but I'm pretty sure
it goes something like:
"You mean a lot to me,
I hope we can be friends, etc. "
I expected this shit, so I took the
liberty of getting them together.
You were right. You do get dumped
for the innocent little twits.
- Well done.
- Thank you.
Now... Where were we?
Oh yes, the celebration.
- What shall we toast to?
- To my triumph.
Not my choice, but it's your call.
To your triumph over Annette.
- What's so funny?
- Silly boy...
My triumph isn't over her.
- It's over you.
- Again?
You were very much in love with her.
And you're still in love with her.
But it amused me
to make you ashamed of it.
You gave up your first love because
I threatened your reputation.
Don't you get it?
You're just a toy, Sebastian.
A little toy I like to play with.
And now you've blown it with her.
I think it's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.
Cheers.
It tastes good.
You came to make arrangements,
but I don't fuck losers.
Goodbye, Sebastian.
- It's imperative I talk to her.
- She's not here.
- Will you please tell her I called?
- Of course I will.
- Yes?
- I need to speak to Annette.
She's not here.
I'm entertaining some guests...
I already told you she is not here.
- Will you see she gets this?
- Yes.
- It's really important.
- I understand.
I'm terribly sorry. You never know
who's going to show up here.
"Dear Annette, what can I say to
rectify the harm I've caused you?"
"Being with you was the only time
I've ever been happy. "
"I prided myself on taking joy
in others' misery. "
"I succeeded in hurting
the first person I loved. "
"Enclosed is my most
prized possession. My journal. "
"I considered it my trophy.
A collection of my conquests. "
"If you want to know the truth,
please read it. No more lies. "
"Please give me another chance.
I'm a wreck without you. "
- Ronald? It's Kathryn.
- What's up?
- Is everything okay?
- No.
It's Sebastian.
He's out of his mind.
He hit me, then he took off.
I'm afraid to be alone.
- Ronald, I really need you.
- Settle down.
There's more.
It involves Cecile.
Son of a bitch...
- Valmont!
- Hey, Ronald.
- We have some talking to do.
- Later. I've had a real bad night.
- What's your problem?
- Why did you hit Kathryn?
She got to you, too...
You don't know what you're saying.
She also said you fucked Cecile.
- It's true, isn't it?
- Ronald, I'm sorry...
Sebastian?
Sebastian!
Stop it!
Annette!
Sebastian...
- I love you, Annette.
- I love you, too.
Just hold on...
As the new headmaster
of Manchester Prep -
- it saddens me to start our
new year with such a mournful tone.
- I didn't know anyone was in here.
- I'm sorry.
- Annette Hargrove.
- Kathryn Merteuil.
- Have we met?
- I don't think so.
- Your father's the new headmaster?
- That's right.
I'm sorry to hear
about your brother. Are you okay?
I'll be fine.
Did you know Sebastian?
You might say that.
Such a tragedy, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
I'll leave you alone now.
I'm here if you need a friend.
That's great.
Sometimes when I feel
I can't go on, -
- I turn to Jesus,
and He helps me through it.
- Thank you.
- I'll see you around campus.
Looking forward to it...
...freak.
Here we go.
However dark the cloud,
there's always a silver lining.
It might be hard to see,
but what we should learn from this -
- is to be true to ourselves
and to resist peer pressure.
As student body president I've tried
to set an example in myself.
Unfortunately, I couldn't reach out
to my stepbrother in time.
I know he's looking down
on us today and...
I know he'd want me to say...
He'd want me to say, "Kathryn... "
He'd want me to say,
"Kathryn, I'm sorry. "
What is going on?
Don't you have any respect?
