Hello.
Okay.
Shaina from Mumbai.
Let her hold.
Kill her.
Yes! Give me.
Don Gani..
Yes, Shaina, tell me.
Don Gani, l was trying to
contact you. - Yes, go ahead.
Golden has been murdered and there
is a blood bath happening here.
You guys don't do anything.
l'm coming to Mumbai
the day after tomorrow.
Tony here. Gani is coming to
Mumbai the day after tomorrow.
Confirmed?
Hundred per cent.
'To rein in the crime in Mumbai..'
'..the government has roped
in the lG of Punjab police..'
'..Mr. Ashraf Taufiq
Khan and appointed him..'
'..the new police
commissioner of Mumbai.'
'He will hold a meeting with
top police officials today.'
Who is this Golden?
He's a big name in
Mumbai underworld.
Two third of Mumbai is
controlled by Golden and his gang.
Kidnapping, contract killing,
extortion, land grabbing.
This is what the gang does.
This gang is run by a
person called Gani, not Golden.
He operates this
gang from outside lndia.
Don Gani.
Yes, tell me.
Yourjob will be done.
We got information from
the intelligence report..
..that in the terrorist
attack on Mumbai last week..
..Gani used his local gang
to help the terrorists..
..come via the sea route.
He never stays in the
country for too long.
That's why he has not
been caught till now.
And who is Datta Pawale?
Datta Pawale used
to be work for Gani.
Tie him to a rock and throw him in.
He built his own gang.
He does the same kind of
work as Golden's gang.
But on a smaller scale.
His right hand's name is Shiva.
He operates in the
area around Versova.
Every other day there's
a gang war between them.
Some from the police department
are hand-in-glove with them.
And both gangs have
political support.
We arrest them in the morning.
But they get released by evening.
Come on. Get in.
Unless we finish the Mumbai
underworld and these local gangs..
..this city can't be safe
from foreign terrorists.
'The moment Ashraf
Khan took charge..'
'..he started
operations against the mafia.'
'ln the past 48 hours more than
'..and eight dangerous
goons have been shot dead.'
'Because of Commissioner
Ashraf's tough stand..'
'..against the Mumbai underworld,
the gangsters are really frightened.'
'Ashraf Khan says it's his
dream to make Mumbai crime free.'
'And to do this, he
will not worry about..'
'..political or
bureaucratic pressure.'
We have to take care of a man.
Who?
Genghis.
The one from Ghatkopar? - Yes.
We have to beat him
up in his locality.
Money.
Which one of you will beat him up?
Radhe.
He's wanted.
ls he any good?
He's more ruthless than Rambo.
More destructive than Terminator.
Smarter than Rocky and
Quicker than Bruce Lee.
He's the last action hero.
Stop!
Nab him!
Nab him!
You scoundrel! Stop there!
Stop!
He's wanted.
The stuff is here brother.
They are just too many.
Go get some more money.
Okay. Excuse me.
Move aside.
Hey! Who are you?
You won't get beaten up
without knowing my name?
So you've taken the
contract to beat me up?
Once l take a contract,
l don't listen to myself even.
You fool. Can't you see
how many men are with me?
Pigs always hunt in groups.
And a tiger hunts alone.
Shankar, pull down the shutters.
Brother.. Keep it slightly open.
He might find it
useful while escaping.
Stop!
Move aside!
You'll die today.
You've made a big mistake
by throwing away the key.
Hey, what will you do? What?
l swear on your mother.
Today, you won't be able to crawl
out of here, let alone walk out.
You're swearing on my mother?
Now that l've sworn on her..
You swore on my mother..
l'll keep it.
You..

Someone like me won't get a
Miss World or Miss Universe.

She gets enticed quickly.
And she won't betray you in love.
You fool. lf you

..the girl will take
your money and run.
lf you chase money,
the girl will chase you.
Excuse me!
l don't agree with you.
Don't look at my face.

Your eyes express what

You love me, too, don't you?
Then, why don't you express it?

And the service weapon that we get..
..is like some old used junk.
The barrel is not straight

..you'll wet your pants.
lt's not wet.
ls it wet?. Then?
Listen, you fool.
You're only a police
commissioner of Mumbai.
l'm an international don.
Higher ranking
officers than you salute me.
l salute only the lndian Tricolour,
not a scoundrel like you.
You'll salute this
scoundrel one day.
l will. l'll surely salute you.
Listen, he's a big don.
See to it that he
is served properly.
Fulfil every wish of his,
but don't let him sleep.
Break his bones if
he tries to sleep.
l won't sleep.
l won't sleep.
My eyes will be open even if l die.
Sir.
Have You arrested Don Gani?
No, sir. How can l arrest Gani?
Not even lnterpol can do it.
Quiet!
l won't rest till l arrest him.
As soon as l arrest him,
l'll inform you.
Sir.
He said he didn't.
What?
He..
The minister had called.
Nobody should know that he's here.
Okay?
sir.
Hello.
Hello. Yes, This is Gani speaking.
Over here.
lncoming free. No outgoing.
Latest stuff.
Keep an eye on him. Understand?
Okay, sir.
What's this nonsense?
Commissioner didn't
put Gani behind bars.
These high level tricks
are hard to understand.
Brother, do you want the
friend or the girl? - girl.
Yes, tell me.
Where are you?
Outside Andheri post office.
No. You're nearby.
l feel you're looking at me.
l'm at the post office.
lf l truly love you,
then you're here.
Brother, what are you eating? Pilaf?
No, tobacco. Want some?
Find one more friend. He'll be
helpful while carrying your coffin.
You can have it then.
So this is Andheri post office?
Go straight and take a right.
lt's near the railway station.
You said you're not here.
How would someone who
only knows to kill..
..understand someone's feelings?
lf you really love me,
you'd understand this.
Do you love someone?
l did till now. But now l don't.
You are getting angry on a joke.
Would l dream that you are around?
This is why l hate you.
l hate you.
Why are you harassing me?
Go on. lt's time for
your aerobics class.
Vent your anger over there.
Aslam.
Yes.
ls your girl like her?
How?
Emotional.
Having a girlfriend is a bad thing.
Waste of time.
You'd better have a
pet than a girlfriend.
l'll do just what you said.
l'll never meet you again.
Tell her to go.
She keeps appearing
like advertisements on TV.
Tell her.
she already left.
She didn't leave. She is fuming.
Scoundrel! Why did you
come back to Mumbai?
What's your plan?
Speak! Answer me!
The plan is in my head.
Let go of my hair.
You may be a big don for the world..
..but you're nothing for me.
l can kill you like this.
Then do it.
Kill me. Why don't you?
l'll tell you what you can do.
At the most you can
present me in court. That's it.
Nothing else.
You know what l'll say in court?
l'll tell the court that Amitabh
Bachchan is a good friend of mine.
And Shah Rukh Khan is
my business partner.
We had met at a wedding in London.
l have video evidence.
lt's different that l
have no relations with them.
But it will take ten
years to prove this in court.
Yes.
What are you thinking?
lt's not too late.
Cut a deal.
Scoundrel!
You talk of striking
a deal all the time.
Did you strike a deal with
your mother to bring you out?
l was too small. l don't remember.
l think he's very angry with me.
lt is Churchgate local..
Hey let's go!
Where are you going?
lt will stop on all the stations.
Oh you missed the catch.
Hot tea! Hot tea!
Hot tea! Hot tea!
Sir, would you like some hot tea?
Chhotu, give me a cup of tea.
Yes.
Go away!
Don't sell tea here.
Hot tea. Hot tea.
l've been sitting
here since a while.
The train has been delayed.
ls it my fault?
Why are you doing this to me?
Why don't you give it all up?
Why don't you leave
your loafer friends?
They are my friends.
They are not like cigarettes that
you throw after you're done smoking.
l'm not a balloon that you let
go after filling it with air.
Balloon?
l mean l'm not a chewing gum..
..that you open it,
chew it and spit it out.
When did l open it?
When did l chew it?
You talk about spitting it?
What have you done for me till now?
Pasta. Pasta. The whole
family lives on pasta.
Have you ever asked me?
Listen, have some pasta.
No.
You want to spend your life with me?
Do you know how l live?
l live on snacks.
Then eat. Eat me. Eat me!
l don't like meat
which has too much fat.
Eat it. Have some pasta!
Gani, my friend. Don't sleep.
They will kill you.
They will..
Why are you staring at me?
Strike a deal for me
with the commissioner.
Go on. Talk to him.
l'll give you whatever you want.
Just get me out of here.
Scoundrel.. you don't listen to me.
The world is sleeping.
So is the sky.
