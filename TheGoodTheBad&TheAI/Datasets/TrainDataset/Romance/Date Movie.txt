- Idiot. Hell, no, I won't marry you. Gosh!
What would you do if you
were in a situation like this?
Gosh! Gosh! Gosh!
Gosh!
Dear diary, I had that nightmare again.
I fear I'll never get married.
Maybe I am destined to be
a sad old spinster...
whose only companionship
comes from an absurd amount of cats.
No, that won't be me.
- I believe in true love.
-
My knight in shining armor
is out there somewhere...
and I'm gonna find him.
Ooh. Mmm.
Oh, shit.
-
-
- Hi, Dad.
And that mole on your forearm,
it's growing a mole.
Let's put some hummus on it.
It cures everything.
Baby, you gotta find a man.
In our race to protect
our Greek heritage-
Yes, yes, yes.
And my heritage too.
- Your mother's right.
- Big sister, we also Japanese.
- And Jewish.
- So you're telling me...
I have to marry a guy
who's a Greek Indian Japanese Jew?
Baby, you're actin' like that's hard to find.
Look around.
They everywhere.
Nicky. Nicky!
You're Greek, right?
Yeah. And Indian
and Japanese and a Jew.
Huh? You wanna
go out with my daughter?
Dad, I know I'm no beauty,
but I'm not gonna settle.
Somewhere out there is my true love.
- More coffee?
- Excellent.
Jolly good.
I quite fancy some...
more coffee, actually.
- Pick up! Pick up!
- Okay.
- Pick up!
- I'm coming.
- ##
- Oh, hell, no!
- You're Hitch?
- You got a problem with that?
Even I can't help you,
and I found Star Jones a husband.
Aw, shit.
Come on in.
Thanks for seeing me.
I heard you're the best.
You're goddamn right I'm the best.
Look at all the couples I'm responsible for.
You got Brad and Jen...
Yeah, I do them too.
Well, there's this guy
at the diner where I work.
- We had this... moment.
- What happened?
I turned around, and he was gone.
He probably got a good look
at your mug and ran.
Why don't we broaden the search
from that one guy to just any nigga?
- Okay.
- Eight out of ten guys believe...
Ooh, stinky. You got the dragon.
You got a little somethin' in there.
A whole wing?
Extra crispy? Goddamn!
- ##
- Off of me, trick!
What, are you hungry?
- I'm hopeless.
I got it!
A reality dating show?
Says here you can meet
the man of your dreams.
It also says you have to be beautiful.
Well, you're beautiful-ish.
Oh, come on, Hitch.
The only way I could get on that show
is if you magically turn me into a princess.
- Let's roll.
- Let's roll.
- Yo, fellas!
Time to pimp her out.
-
-
-
- Mm-mm-mm.
Oh.
Hey! Hey!
Yeah!
All right, girl.
Now you're good to go.
Ladies, good evening,
and welcome to...
will be chosen by the bachelor
to go on a dream date.
-
He's a doctor with a 12-inch cock.
- Hi. Lovely to meet you.
- Hi.
- Hello. I'm Grant. Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Julia.
- Pleasure.
Now, Grant, the elimination round.
-
-
Nice aim, Grant.
Good eye.
- Julia, will you accept this rose?
- Yes.
Guys, congratulations.
You have won a dinner for two
at A Restaurant.
A Restaurant!
Thanks!
Oh, yeah, that's it!
Oh, God!
Oh, yeah!
Yeah! Yeah.
Yes! Yes!
Yes!
Oh, yes! Oh, yeah!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Oh, God. Whoo! God.
- So you're saying you  want the pork chops?
- Yes, please.
- I'll have what he's having.
So, tell me about you.
Oh, I'm just a waitress.
But I- I want to go to school
to be a pastry chef.
Oh, hi.
My name is Julia Jones.
And for my admissions essay,
I'm gonna show all of you at Harvard...
why I would make
an amazing pastry chef.
What a coincidence.
I love pie. I've got to take you
downtown for the best-
- Hummus pie?
- You've been there?
That's actually my recipe.
-
Like, what's your favorite love song?
- It's kind of corny.
- Oh, come on.
##
##
##
You're that waitress.
You've changed.
Well, I- I was- I was sort of goin' through-
through a phase.
I was downright ugly.
I don't remember you ever being ugly.
But I remember you.
I can't explain it, but...
when I'm with you,
I just feel so alive.
- Me too.
- I just wanna scream and shout and-
- Roll drunks?
- Huh?
- Uh, Julia?
-
Come on!
- That was... amazing.
-
-
But I didn't.
Meow.
Oh, no, no, no, no...
No! No!
Ooh.
Hoo. It's tingly.
- So, Grant, ever knock anyone up?
- Mom!
Bathroom's down the hall.
Just leave the sample on the counter.
Oh, sorry.
- That's Jinxers.
-
Taught him how to do that.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Julia told me your last name.
- How do you pronounce it?
- Just how it's spelled.
F-O-C-K-Y-E-R-D-O-D-E-R.
- Fockyerdoder?
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.
-
-
- Allergic to cats?
Uh, no, no.
I-I-I love cats.
I got nipples, Grant.
Can you milk me?
May I say that's an exquisite vase.
Ancient artifact, I presume.
That's actually an urn containing
the remains of Frank's mother.
-
would want to celebrate that
Julia finally applied to pastry school.
- What? School?
- Don't you want me to better myself?
No! I want you to work
at the diner until you die.
Grant was just kidding.
Right, Grant?
-
- No!
- Mama!
-
-
- Jinxers. Jinxers, no.
-
- Oh! Grandma Jones! Oh, God!
- No! Jinxers, stop it!
- Hey!
- Oh!
- Get off my mama! Stop humpin'!
- Jinxers, no!
- Oh!
- I didn't teach him how to do that.
Jinxers, no!
-
- That was a disaster.
- It wasn't that bad.
You desecrated my grandmother's remains,
and my father hates you.
Why didn't you tell your parents
about pastry school?
- ##
- I'm working my way up to it.
- I'm just waiting for the right time.
- Julia, you're a grown woman.
If you haven't noticed,
my family is totally controlling.
- Whoo!
- They meddle in every aspect of my life.
Not to mention,
no one in our family...
- has ever dated outside of our culture.
- He reminds me of Webster.
I just don't see how this
could work between us.
Look, so your family's difficult.
Whose isn't?
Until I met you, my life was boring.
- Oww!
- But you, you're smart...
and interesting and beautiful.
Did you say I was beautiful?
- Come with me.
- Ooh-hoo!
It's just a little Jesus juice!
Whoo!
Where are you taking me?
- What are we-
- You'll see.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Julia Jones, will you marry me?
Yes, Grant Fockyerdoder,
I will marry you.
How much will you give me for this?
No. No!
- Fifty bucks.
- Shit. That's it?
But it will destroy all evil!
Oh, screw off, wizard!
-
-
- Come on. Let's go get some wine coolers.
- And some hookers.
My precious!
##
Before you set the wedding date,
I wanted to meet your parents...
because, frankly, Fockyerdoder,
I don't know much about you.
I understand, homeboy.
I'll be watching you.
If you do anything
to corrupt my daughter-
You'll bring me down
to Chinatown?
Chinatown?
I'll take your bitch ass to 134th Street...
bust you in the head with a pipe.
##
Hi, Little Jack.
How come you have Betty's baby?
She's at a swingers convention this weekend,
so we said we'd take care of him.
- Oh, how nice.
- And Betty's such a good mother.
She's teaching Little Jack
sign language.
Oh, I heard about this.
Real cutting-edge stuff.
That's right, Little Jack.
"Keep your pimp hand strong."
Right!
"The dealer pinched."
"What happens when someone
rats us out to the cops?"
"Shiv 'em in the kidney."
- "Beotch."
-  His first word!
- Little Jack, what did you say?
- "Beotch."
Is that your dad?
- Uh-huh.
- Figures.
Ha!
-
- Good to see ya.
This is my fiancée Julia,
and her parents, Linda and Frank.
Bernie Fockyerdoder.
Pleased to meet all of ya.
Frank, give me some sugar.
Put her there!
- All right, all right.
- And this must be your little girl.
- No, that's my wife.
- Wife? So young, so pretty.
And you must be Julia.
What a beautiful moment this is.
So beautiful.
Just beautiful.
- Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!
- Oh!
- Dad. Dad.
- Mmm! Mmm!
- What? We're all family now.
So what was that
you were doin' back there?
Oh, I was just practicing capoeira.
- Capo-what?
- Capoeira...
the Brazilian martial art
of dance fighting.
- Beotch.
- I've been doing it for weeks.
It keeps me level.
-
-  Ah!
Come on.
Let's go meet Roz.
-
- Roz!
You're gonna love her.
Everybody, this is Roz.
Oh! I've been  to meet...
this meshuggener goyim shiksa all day!
Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
So, Grant tells me
you're a doctor.
Uh, I'm a sex therapist.
I specialize in teenage impotency.
- Who's thirsty?
- Mom, no.
Oh, Grantulla's just embarrassed because
he lost his virginity to the housekeeper.
- Hey, Eduardo.
-
Ah!
So, is it Harry?
- Is what hairy?
- Your name.
- No, no, it's Bernie.
- Oh, no, but it is hairy.
- What are you talking about?
- I mean, picture this with four pounds of hair.
Well, we wanted a long engagement...
Oh, hell, no.
I'm not paying for that wedding.
Aw, don't have a conniption,
We'll pay for it.
You'll meet her tomorrow morning.
Let's have a toast.
- To great big matzo balls!
-
I- I couldn't be happier.
Thanks, Dad.
Because Nicky
has agreed to marry you.
- Nicky.
- Yeah. Good job.
Lookin' good. Nice.
- Dad?
- Hmm?
My whole life, I've had this dream...
that a prince would someday
come and rescue me.
Grant is that guy.
He's my prince,
and he's the one I'm gonna marry.
No, you'll never marry Grant.
- Wow. You seem tense.
-
- When was the last time
you and Frank were intimate?
- It's been a while.
Whoo! It sure has.
Well, I could show you a few tricks,
spice things up again.
- Like what?
- Like a dirty Sanchez.
- Like a-
Oh, I don't know.
- Or the Arabian goggles.
- Ohh!
Where you don't clip your toenails
for eight weeks...
and then you jab it up his ass!
Or a Mexican blowtorch...
where you take a cotton swab, you dip it
in alcohol, put it on the top of his dick...
and then you light it on fire.
-
- Is that all you got, Fockyerdoder?
Hold on.
- How do you think it's going?
- I think it's going really well.
- You do?
- Yeah. Everyone's getting along famously.
Even our dads are hitting it off.
- You might want to put your shirt back on.
- Nah.
- Oh, man.
-
- The wedding planner will see you now.
I'm Jell-O. Fockyerdoder?
Please, have a seat.
Well, uh, we want
a traditional wedding.
Something simple, yet elegant.
Yo, I know exactly the place.
Muy romántico.
Think outside my buns.
It's... not quite
what we had in mind.
That's the best I can do
on short notice.
Oh, I've already taken care of that.
- My best mate Andy flew in this morning.
- Andy?
Yeah, we'll meet up at the hotel later.
- I think you two will hit it off tremendously.
- I can't wait.
And I can't wait till you see
who I booked for the entertainment.
No!
So, where is this best man of yours?
Andy!
Andy's not a guy?
A guy?
Heavens, no.
It's great we've remained so close,
even after the engagement fell through.
You two were engaged?
Ages ago. It was more physical
than anything, really.
Just constant...
Sex.
S-So, you realized
it- it just wasn't right?
Well, she realized it wasn't right.
She dumped me.
Just wasn't ready to settle down.
Why is she in slow motion?
- She likes to make an entrance.
- Oh!
-
This is Julia.
Mmm!
Oh, I have heard
so much about you.
Now, Grant told me
how attractive you were...
How cute.
Excuse me while I get out
of these wet clothes.
- So, how did you two meet?
- We were in Beverly Hills.
I'll give you two grand
if I can fuck you in the ass.
- Sounds quite reasonable.
And so, eventually, you got engaged...
and then you broke up ages ago.
You were engaged to her
three weeks ago?
you have nothing
to be jealous about.
-
-
-
Finger sandwich?
Okay, I'll go first.
Okay, I'll go first.
Let me say we don't
really need to be here.
- See, we've been dating for five days-
- Six.
Five, six days,
and this is like a checkup for us.
There's this huge space between us...
Pretty honest.
I mean, it's not like
I lie to him or anything.
-
I mean, I-I have little secrets.
Everyone has secrets.
I have hepatitis "C."
I'm not sure, really.
Let me clarify.
I love Julia.
I... want her to be happy.
I want good things for her.
But there are times-
You know, when she's sleeping,
just take a pillow and-
To be honest,
I was surprised you called.
Well, you're a part of Grant's life...
and that means
you're a part of my life too.
You look like a princess.
You don't think it's a bit too much?
Oh, not at all.
I'll go get some pins to fit it.
Uh-oh.
Why do you insist
on dressing me in these fruity outfits?
- I'm gonna take this lollipop
and shove it up your ass.
-
I can hear everyone's thoughts.
I love Puerto Rican men. They're spicy.
It's like I'm trapped
in a bad Mel Gibson movie.
What the hell was I thinkin'?
He's a freakin' backup dancer.
-  Dude, I married Britney Spears!
-
I'm rich! I'm rich, beotch!
- Is the bride-to-be ready?
Bride-to-be? Shit. Not if I can help it.
I've got 24 hours
to break up this wedding.
- No.
- Yes!
Me, me, me!
- Stay away from me!
- Oh!
- What is it now?
- Grant's got an ex-fiancée.
And she has a thing for him.
I just know it.
How can I measure up to that?
You can't.
She's fine as hell.
I would tear that shit up!
You know, everything was going so well
until she turns up.
Look, he's not with Andy anymore.
He's with you.
You gotta put aside your insecurities.
It'll all work out.
- Do you really believe that?
- No, but my white customers do.
Wow.
-
And before you know it,
you'll be walking down the aisle.
Oh, and saying our vows.
And our first dance!
##
You call that dancin'?
No.
- You see this? This is where you live.
Right here.
This is your home. Huh?
Well, how about this?
- That bitch be krumpin'!
It's okay. It's okay.
She's never gonna break us up.
Grant and I just have to get through
the rehearsal dinner...
and then tomorrow's the big day.
Once we're married,
everything will be perfect.
-
- Who are you kidding?
-
- Grant's never gonna marry you.
- Don't say that!
- This is who you really are.
-
You may look different,
but inside you'll always be me.
- No, please, stop.
- You'll be stuck in that diner till the end of time.
I don't believe you.
True love is a myth.
You better hurry up and marry Nicky...
before you end up
a fat, dusty old maid.
- Never!
- You'll see.
-
-
Quiet, everyone. Quiet.
Roz has a few words to say.
Oh, thank you, hon.
Mmm!
I would like to make a toast.
To Grant and Julia!
Yeah! What?
Okay!
Get crunk!
Get crunked!
You like it?
You look... ravishing.
What? What's wrong?
Grant, your whole courtship
has been rocky, to say the least.
I just hope you're not rushing
into this marriage with Julia...
I-
Oh, dear God.
A carousel.
I, uh- I'd better get back.
Grant, this is our rehearsal dinner.
We're getting married tomorrow.
I need to know-
do you still have feelings for Andy?
Of course not.
I trust you.
I just don't want to get hurt.
You have nothing to worry about.
forever.
##
##
No.
Not a zit on my wedding day!
Ohh.
Where the hell is Julia?
Grant, I wouldn't be your best man
unless I told you this.
Julia doesn't deserve you.
Do you ever think about us?
Yeah.
Me too.
My grandmother's ring.
She gave you this ring
on her deathbed...
and made you promise to give it to the woman
you wanted to spend the rest of your life with.
You gave it to me.
My grandfather's toe ring.
and make you promise to give it
to the woman you'd cherish forever?
You gave that to me too.
- Julia-
- Oh! She's just the rebound girl.
I'm ready to take you back.
Choose me. Marry me.
Andy, I just don't feel
the same way about you anymore.
Julia's the one.
Then one last kiss.
Julia, no!
##
Desperate Housewives!
Oh. Jinxers?
-
Let's get you out of that funk.
Julia, will you marry me?
It was good, right?
I know Nicky's a little
rough around the edges...
but give him a chance.
When your mother and I first got married,
we barely knew each other.
I was a mail-order bride,
could barely speak the English language.
Dad, you're from Jersey.
I'm tryin' to make a point here.
At first,
Linda and I couldn't get along.
I'm proud to say
we've been married for 30 years...
but that's real life.
So, what do you say?
I've been fooling myself all along.
And true love is something
that only exists in the movies.
Okay, Dad,
I'll marry Nicky.
Back to work.
You're crying.
Tears of joy, Dad.
We are gathered here to join
this man and this woman...
speak now or forever hold your peace.
- I object!
- Thank God!
This isn't what you wanted.
It's what I wanted.
He even liked you
when you were butt-ugly.
- How do you-
- I saw it in your flashback.
I don't know.
You need to read this.
On the Internet?
You've Got Mail,
Sleepless in Seattle.
Right. The observation deck
of the Empire State Building.
But how do I get there?
But I only have a T-Mobile Sidekick.
You can borrow my Treo 650.
A Restaurant? But that's way uptown.
Traffic's a nightmare.
Okay! Great!
This issue's six months old.
I hope he's still waiting.
He'd be a fool not to wait for my daughter.
Go get him, baby.
Thanks, Dad.
- Taxi! Taxi!
-
- Taxi!
Someone!
Someone please help!
I need to get across town fast.
- I owe you.
- Damn straight!
I'm Hitch, bitch!
- Come on. Open up!
Oh, please!
He's mine!
-
- Keep your damn hands off my man!
I'm too late.
Julia!
- Ohh!
-
What happens after the prince
rescues the princess?
She rescues him right back.
You make me want to be
a better man.
You had me at "hello."
I'm just a girl standing
in front of a boy...
asking him to love her.
What?
I'm also an ordained minister.
By the powers vested in me...
I now pronounce you
man and wife.
Show her some love, man!
- Bravo!
- Beautiful!
- Yeah-
-
Julia!
This is for you.
It lets you know
when you're ovulating.
It's been in our family
for generations.
And if you want to keep it
our lucky thermometer, don't ever wash it.
- Julia.
- Dad.
You're gonna have to find
a new waitress.
It's about time.
Come here.
Hey.
Take care of my daughter.
Come on.
-
Hey, is it too late to crash
the Fockyerdoder wedding?
Bye.
Please help me!
-
Help!
Keep the camera rolling.
- Help! Please!
-
No. No!
-
-
- Ooh!
- That feels kinda good.
-
A little... kinky.
Oh, yeah!
-
I like hairy boys.
-
-
-
-
- Yes! Yes!
Yes!
Yes! Beautiful.
Yes, drink it.
You're gonna love it.
Is that Cos's hand on your booty?
I'm kind of an amateur tennis player.
I was playing,
it was a drizzly day...
and Roz came down and volunteered
to hold my balls and keep 'em dry.
- His balls-
- We got rained out anyway.
His balls are always wet,
whether it's raining or not.
Hey, is it too late
for one more parody?
It's on the Hudson...
with breathtaking views of the skyline.
Yeah! What? Okay!
Get crunk!
-
Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!
I'm your baby! Nyah-nyah!
