But it was here
on the acropolis hill
that some believe
Theseus's father king Aegeus
looked out to sea, waiting
for his son to return.
See, Theseus had
promised his father
that if he defeated
the minotaur,
he'd hoist a white sail
on his ship as a tribute.
But he was so excited
to get back home,
he forgot and he flew
the same black sail
that he set out with.
Well, thinking his son was dead,
the heartbroken king flung
himself onto the rocks below.
Another victim of the cruel
tricks gods play on men.
Well, I hope you ladies
brought your handkerchiefs,
'cause the next thing
you're about to see
has been known to make some weep
at first sight.
Follow me.
the Parthenon.
From the Greek word
meaning "virgins."
"The ancient Greeks
were masters of deception.
Even though the base
of the Parthenon appears
straight to the naked eye,
it is, in fact,
completely crooked.
Indeed, if one were
to leave one's hat
on one side of the temple steps,
it would vanish altogether
when viewed from the other."
- You're making this up.
- Oh, only one way to find out.
- Oh.
- Wanna try it?
- All right.
- Come on.
All right.
You go on down there,
- I'll put the hat right here.
- Mm-hmm.
Off you go.
- Is this far enough?
- That's perfect.
Oh my God, you're right.
Really?
No.
Aw jeez.
Sucker born every minute.
- Come on, baby.
- I got you.
Oh well.
Gosh, it's so hot.
Yeah. Getting bored
of the Parthenon?
- No no no no.
- Come on, we have to finish the bottle.
I was supposed to meet
my friends an hour ago.
Oh, you just tell 'em you got lost.
I'm a terrible tour guide.
- Let me get this.
- No no no, I got it.
- I got it.
- Thank you.
My pleasure.
Actually, do you have any...
- Small bills?
- Oh, umm...
- Change?
- I think so.
- Shall I take a look?
- Yeah, actually, I'm not sure.
Okay. All right,
so it's four drachmas,
so if I take five and $10,
I'll give you back 200 drachmas.
- Good?
- Okay.
Thank you.
True story.
She's very pretty, isn't she?
Oh no, I was... I was looking
at the guy that she was with.
He reminds me
of my father a little bit.
It says we should go to
the flea market on Sunday.
Don't look now,
but there's a young guy
in a gray shirt
sitting with a girl
in blue and white striped dress.
Staring at me now.
Okay.
Now I'm curious.
Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't speak Greek.
- Somebody's in there.
- You're American?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Trenton.
- New Jersey?
I thought you were Greek.
I thought you were Greek.
Uh, I'm a tour guide.
Do you need one?
He's an American tour guide,
he's been here a year
- Do you believe him?
- You can ask him yourself.
He's gonna show us around
the flea market Sunday.
"Rydal."
Fancy.
So Colette tells me
you went to Yale.
- What did you major in?
- Economics.
- Hmm.
Good training for a tour guide.
Yeah, well, that wasn't
the plan initially.
My father had a job lined up
at a friend's law firm and...
and you ran away
as fast as you could.
Something like that. What do
you do for a living, sir?
Call me Chester.
I look after people's savings,
mostly low-risk investments.
How much?
There you go.
- A steal.
- You must be doing pretty well, though,
if you're staying at the grand.
Honey, look at this.
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- It sure is.
Actually, this is
a Cretan design.
You see how the snakes
come together and never end?
That represents immortality.
People wear it
as a protection charm.
- Oh.
- You like it, hon?
- I love it.
- Well, let's get it then.
How much is it?
All right, so 1500,
which is about $50.
- 50 bucks?
- Good deal.
Will he take dollars?
Well, you can give me dollars
and I'll give him drachmas.
Okay. Fair enough.
- It looks great on you.
- It's gorgeous.
Say, why don't you
join us for dinner?
- Would you do that?
- Sure, yes, I'd love to.
But I'm... I'm meeting
a friend later.
She can come too.
Honey,
- that's embarrassing.
- No, it got so bad
that we started counting
how many times a day
the Parisians would insult us.
We got up to 15 one night,
- nine in the same restaurant.
- Was it your first time there?
Mmm. Chester helped
liberate Paris.
- All by myself.
You fought in the war?
Just the last part.
Whereabouts?
Normandy, the Ardennes,
a few other places.
Wow.
Heck of a joint you picked out.
It's modeled after
the old ottoman cafes.
Huh. Great guide,
isn't he?
- Knows everything.
Mm-hmm.
He's an even better writer.
Is that so?
What do you write? The
most beautiful poems.
He's gonna be famous one day.
Happy or depressing poems?
- Unpublished poems, mostly.
- I'm sure you'll find...
- Sir.
- ...Plenty of inspiration in Greece.
And your first date
was yesterday?
- The day before.
- Oh, the day before.
That's the sound and light show.
I can get you tickets
if you're interested...
tomorrow night,
best seats in the house.
Thanks,
but unfortunately, we're...
- we're leaving tomorrow.
- Oh, really?
Yeah, I wanted to show
Colette Rome and Venice
before we go back
to the states, so...
How about you?
Any plans to go home soon?
Uh, yeah, at some point,
when I run out of money.
Doesn't sound like
you're in a big hurry.
Oh, thanks.
Well, Chester,
I gotta figure out
what I wanna do first.
Sure.
That's the best thing
about being your age.
There's a surprise
around every corner.
Yeah, I guess so.
Did you know
that she was a Van Buren?
- Who's that?
- Your friend Lauren.
- I only just met her.
- Mm-hmm.
Was he the seventh
or the eighth president?
- He was the eighth.
- Yeah.
- No, I'm... I'm... I'm not...
- I know, I know.
Hey, listen,
I've been married twice,
both times to beautiful
women with no money.
I'm gonna say this
because I love Colette
and I'm a little tanked.
But... but they can
be a burden.
Yeah, well, I don't think
she's all that interested.
- Oh no? Hey, ladies.
- No, don't.
- What are you two gossiping about?
- None of your business.
- See?
- All right, all right.
- It was so nice to meet you.
- It was so nice to meet you.
- Thank you for dinner.
- Bye.
Thanks for taking
such good care of us.
Good luck with your studies.
My pleasure.
Well, I hope
we meet again sometime.
Me too.
- Enjoy Rome.
- Oh. Well, we'll try.
Thank you very much.
Good night, son.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Goodbye.
- She's very sweet.
Wouldn't trust him
to mow my lawn.
I thought he was...
- Very interesting.
- Oh yeah?
Well, that's 'cause
he couldn't keep
- his eyes off you all night.
- No.
Does he still
remind you of your father?
He's a lot easier to talk to.
Where are you taking us
on our last day?
Sounion.
Wish we were staying longer.
Oh, she forgot her bracelet.
Everything all right in there?
Oh yeah.
Come on. Get outta here.
No thank you!
Uh...
Fuck off.
Ah!
Just put
the "do not disturb" on.
No thank you.
Mr. Donlevy?
- No.
- Your name's not Donlevy?
No. No no. I think you've
got the wrong room.
How about Mr. McFarland?
- Yes.
- May I come in?
- Stock market.
- Canadian oil shares.
Hang on right here.
I'll just get
my coat and we'll go downstairs.
We can talk about it
right in here.
No, let's just go to the bar.
Right in there would be great.
Sorry to barge in
on your like this, ma'am.
Are you sure you don't
want me to wait?
It's fine. You get back
to the hotel, all right?
I'll call you in the morning.
- Okay.
- Bye.
You ran a brokerage firm called
Donlevy & Walters back in New York.
That's right.
You with the embassy?
No.
I represent some
very unhappy clients
who invested
their money with you.
You ought to be more careful
who you do business with.
Listen, I'm sorry that
your clients are upset,
but I can't help it
if the market crashes.
This is a nice hotel.
Just like all the other nice
hotels you've been staying at.
I've been following your trail all
across Europe, Mr. McFarland.
You've been throwing
a lot of cash around.
- How long is the trip to Mycenae?
- A whole day, madam.
huh?
No.
Infantry...
-
- Yeah.
It's funny, you know?
All that time over here
during the war,
I could give a shit
about Europe.
Yet here I am again.
Here's the deal:
I could care less about
your other investors.
You reimburse my clients,
I'll go back home to my family
and leave you
and your lovely wife alone.
My wife has nothing
to do with this.
Look, why don't
you and I go downstairs,
have a drink,
see if we can come
to an arrangement?
Unfortunately, I'm not authorized
to negotiate with you.
I'm just here for the money.
Yeah.
Okay, well,
let me go and get it.
Chester?
-
- Don't come in!
- Hello. Hi.
- Hello.
I need to return something
to some friends of mine,
- the McFarlands.
- They're in room 505.
- Is there a phone I can use?
- The house phone is right over there.
Ah, thank you.
Don't answer it!
Don't answer it.
- What's happening?
- He's fine. He fell.
He hit his head pretty bad.
I've got to take him downstairs,
get him some help.
I thought you said
no one would follow us.
Open the door!
Get dressed, start packing. We've
gotta get out of here right away.
Oh God.
No.
Can you, uh...
can you help me
-
- He's hammered, that's what happened.
I found him in the lobby.
Good evening.
Evening.
Easy, like this.
Oh Christ.
- Is he okay?
- He'll be fine.
He's gonna have an almighty
hangover tomorrow though.
Who is he?
I haven't the foggiest idea.
Some drunk.
He tried to paw Colette in the elevator,
then followed us to our room,
Let's let him sleep it off.
Oh.
Your wife left it in the cab.
I was bringing it back.
The truth is...
I owe some people money.
They sent him to
threaten us with a gun.
Look.
I don't know what to do.
I mean, I...
I don't know...
if he's alone or there's
somebody else in the lobby.
All I know is we gotta
get out of this hotel
before that man wakes up.
Can you help us?
Thank you.
It's perfect.
It feels like New York.
Oh, is that you?
Is he back home?
Uh, he passed away a month ago.
I'm sorry.
Private detective.
Gambling syndicate back home.
that didn't work out.
Sent this guy after us.
God knows who else.
Well, the airport opens up
in a few hours.
You'll be gone
before the guy wakes up.
Hotel took our passports
when we checked in.
- You don't have your passports?
-
Well, I... I mean I can try
to go get 'em for you,
but I don't think
they're gonna give 'em to me.
Naw naw, it wouldn't
be safe anyway.
Might be more of 'em
waiting for us.
I don't know. I gotta
get Colette outta here.
We need new passports,
new identities.
I have a friend that I get
American cigarettes from.
He might know somebody
that could help you out.
You okay?
No.
He's gonna help us.
We'll fly outta here soon.
Where?
We'll see.
I'm sorry.
Okay, my friend
can arrange the new passports
for $1,000... each.
So...
Half now,
half on delivery or...?
- Niko...
- excuse me.
When will the passports
be ready?
Mmm, five days.
- No no.
-
We can't hang around
Athens that long.
For another $1,000...
He can deliver
the passports to Crete.
- Crete?
-
Well, that's...
I mean, I don't know Crete
from a hole in the ground.
Where am I gonna...
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
What did he say?
What's the matter?
No no no.
I should come with you.
- What?
-
- No no no.
- You're not gonna know your way around.
I can go with you.
You would do that?
Yes.
I'd certainly make it
worth your while.
It's okay, it's...
it's not about the money.
No, I know, but you deserve...
you have to pay him
another $500.
500...
so 1500 more?
Yeah.
Did you give him
any money for the drinks?
I offered.
Well, you should have insisted.
He's probably
too proud to accept.
Trust me, he's doing fine.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means he already
skimmed his commission.
Why else do you think
he's helping us?
I'm sure it's not
just the money.
No?
I think he's also
got a thing for you.
Either way, we need him...
At least for a few more days.
- Hey, buddy.
- Coffee's cold and the beer's warm.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
- Thanks.
- Anything interesting in the newspaper?
Greeks and Turks are at
each other's throats again.
Hey, honey, do you mind going in
and seeing what's
taking him so long?
Please?
Well, we can't check
in without all three passports.
- Why not?
- It's a legal requirement.
Apparently, it's the same
everywhere in Iraklion.
But if we go to a smaller town,
they might be more
relaxed about the rules.
- Where'd you have in mind?
- Chania.
It's up the coast
and there's a bus
that leaves first thing
in the morning.
- In the morning?
- Yeah.
We could stay up.
It's warm enough.
And you can leave
your suitcases here.
Uh, no.
My father almost
had a heart attack
when I left home. He said, "New
York has turned its back on God."
"And you should be
very careful, young lady."
Oh lord.
Taverna Asterion...
what is "Asterion"?
Asterius is a minotaur.
So Asterion would have been...
Grandfather.
Actually, it's the same name.
Asterius, Asterion...
it's just a different pronunciation.
It means the same thing.
-
- Mmm.
Who knew?
- Where did you live?
- On Hudson and 11th.
I shared an apartment
with three Barnard...
I'm fading. I don't know if
I can stay up much longer.
Well, order some coffee.
I think I'm gonna have
another scotch.
So how did the two of you meet?
I crashed one of his
parties with a girlfriend.
It was like nothing
I'd ever seen.
There was champagne and caviar
and millionaires everywhere.
Garcon!
May I have a cigarette, please?
Whiskey.
And a whiskey.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
You must be awfully...
Good at languages to pick
up Greek so quickly.
I had a head start.
My father
made me and my sisters
learn different languages
since we could
practically speak,
so every month it would
be a different language...
French and then Italian,
- then Russian.
- Russian?
Can I keep the bottle?
And the thing is when he'd
overhear us speaking English
we'd get demerits. There was
this chart in the hall.
Even my poor mother would
get on it now and then.
And what did your father do?
He was a Professor
of archeology at Harvard.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
He certainly thought so.
And you don't?
Listen, my old man drove
a truck for a living.
He didn't teach us very good
English, never mind French
Impressive.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
It is.
I'd like to dance.
Okay, yeah, all right.
May I finish my scotch first?
Rydal?
Uh...
Knock yourself out.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
- Let me help you.
- I got it!
Honey... honey!
I just want to sit here
- and finish my cigarette.
- Are you sure you're all right?
Stop asking me that!
The bus leaves in a few hours.
We'll just...
Have to hang in there.
Go ahead, I'll catch up.
- Hey, I hope that...
- you know what?
Just run along, Rydal.
I bet you wish you never met us.
No.
No, I'm glad I did.
Not you.
Shit.
Oh.
Uh,
Kafe?
And, uh...
One of them.
- Donut?
- Donut.
Yeah, donut.
Morning.
I brought you a Greek donut.
Thanks.
It's good.
and I thought we were back at
the beach house on long island.
Hey.
When we get our new passports,
I'll straighten things out
with those guys in New York.
We'll be home soon.
- Morning.
- Ahem.
Oh whew.
We should get going
if we're gonna catch the bus.
- Thanks.
- Hey, Rydal?
How long are we stopping here?
I don't know. It depends how long
the bus driver takes to eat.
Can I get you something?
Uh...
Yeah, a beer'd be nice.
Okay.
I got it.
Hey, Rydal?
Uh...
I want to apologize for last night.
I was out of line.
Colette told me your dad passed
away recently. I didn't know.
I'm sorry.
He died.
It's all over the news.
You have to turn yourself in.
It was self-defense.
They mention any suspects?
No, but they have...
they have your passports.
It's just a matter of time.
If you turn yourself in...
they'll arrest you
as an accomplice.
Witnesses saw both of us with
the body in the hotel hallway.
You arranged
fake passports for us.
- No no no.
- You accompanied us to Crete.
And now you're carrying what? An extra
$1,000 of my money in your pocket?
I'm trying to help you.
I know.
I know you are.
Did you know he was dead?
Colette doesn't.
I'd prefer it
if she didn't find out.
I'm finally in a good mood
and now you two are sulking.
- I'm just a little tired.
- I bet I can make you laugh.
Oh, finish your O-Zo
and I'll try again.
It's "ouzo."
O-u-z-o.
Four letters.
Well, it tastes like
gasoline to me.
Hey, you want to share
some oysters, hon?
The guidebook says it's a bad
idea to eat shellfish here.
The Greeks have only been doing
it for thousands of years,
but I'm sure your parochial
guidebook's probably right.
Better to eat shellfish
from some dirty New York kitchen
than right here by the sea where
it's caught in front of your eyes.
- I wish I was in New York right now.
- Oh, skip it.
Of course we can't
go back to New York.
We can't go anywhere in the states
because Chester's business ventures
- have been such a huge success.
- There's three of us here at the table.
I'm sure Rydal doesn't
want to hear
you whine about
how homesick you are.
All right, why don't you
lay off her?
Who, my wife?
- Don't rise to it.
- No, let him.
Let's hear what's on his mind.
Don't you ever speak
to me like that again.
Or what?
Are we gonna talk about this?
We had an argument.
There's nothing to talk about.
Are you sure?
Is there gonna be another
black mark against me?
Look, I got upset because
I don't like you discussing
my business in front of him.
He could use it against us.
Oh.
That's ridiculous.
Is it? He's done
nothing but lie to us.
I mean do you believe any
of that Harvard Yale crap?
I don't really care.
It's not like we've been
straight with him.
Why are you defending him?
Because I like him.
And I appreciate
what he's doing for us.
You like him.
I didn't mean it like that.
One second.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Just thought I'd take a walk,
but I don't know what there is
to see in this town.
Uh, ruins.
Your room's smaller than ours.
Well, there's only one of me.
Anything interesting happening
- in the outside world?
- Uh...
Soccer.
- Where's Chester?
-
He's taken a sleeping pill.
Hmm.
You keep a diary?
Yeah, it's just
notes for my work.
Anything about me and Chester?
Maybe there's a line or two.
You coming with me?
For a walk.
Sure, yeah, I'll come with you.
Good.
Sweetie?
Uh, excuse me.
I have no idea where I am.
I, uh...
how do I get downtown?
You know,
where the people gather?
Whiskey?
Whiskey.
Tell the driver that
I just want to drive around.
- I'm looking for my wife.
- Okay.
Wife, sure, yes.
- Go inside.
- Okay.
Oh, my friend, you pay first.
- Pay first?
- Yes!
- How much is it?
- I show you, I show you, I show you.
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?
- I don't know where I'm going. Just tell him...
- 50.
Thanks.
- Go inside.
- You understand I just want to drive around?
Good luck with your wife.
Hang on, stop stop
stop stop stop.
Stop stop.
Colette!
Colette!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hey!
Son of a bitch!
He punched me, he punched me!
Stop, stop stop,
the cops are here.
Go.
Get out of here!
Ah, he just
sucker-punched me.
Shh, come on, shh, come on.
- Where the hell were you, anyway?
- Be careful.
- Where have you guys been?
- Shh, please please calm down.
- Did you sleep with him?
- Shh. No.
You see what he's doing?
He's trying to tear us apart
- this whole trip!
- No! Calm down.
He told you, didn't he?
Did he tell you?
- What are you talking about?
- He was...
- told me what?
- The guy hit his head!
All right? He had a gun,
what am I supposed to do?
I was trying to protect you.
I was trying to protect you.
Forget it.
Forget it.
Why didn't you tell me?
He asked me not to say anything.
- He thought that you would panic.
- He killed someone!
Why would you lie for him?
I didn't do it for him.
You shouldn't have done it
for either of us.
Those people that are after
him... what did he do?
He swindled them.
He sold them shares in an oil
field that didn't exist.
Them and hundreds
of other people.
How much did you know?
He's my husband.
I'll call my friend
in the morning,
see if your passports are ready.
Hide some place else?
Change our names?
I can't live like that anymore.
I didn't know.
...Niko.
I think it's better
if you and Colette
don't sit next to each other.
Why don't you and I
sit together?
Do you mind, sweetie?
- Oh shit.
- What?
Hey.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Hey!
Hey!
- What the hell's going on?
- She thinks they recognized her.
Nobody recognized you.
- She says they recognized her.
- Get back on the bus!
- No! Get your hands off of me!
- Let's go! Get back on the fucking bus!
This is all your fault!
Don't blame me.
- Listen here...
- okay.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me.
You should get some rest.
You get some rest.
I'm fine.
I'm gonna have a look around.
Hey! Wake up.
Let's go.
Come on, wake up, sweetie.
Let's go.
Let's get you out of the rain.
We gotta go.
Thanks.
I'm gonna go see if there's
somewhere we can rest.
I'll be right back.
Colette.
Chester?
- Chester!
- I'm gonna go look for him, okay?
Stay here.
Chester?
Rydal?
Did you find him?
- Where's Rydal?
- Forget about Rydal.
What have you done to him?
Nothing.
Come on, let's go.
- Tell me.
- He's fine!
- Where is he?
- We don't need him.
Look, I'm sorry.
I know I screwed up.
I'll make it up to you.
We can start over.
- It's too late.
- Don't say that!
God!
Colette!
Oh. Oh no.
No. No. No.
No. No no! God, no!
No! No! No!
Oh no. No.
Where's Rydal?
He ran away with my wife.
You got my passport?
Another 2500, like we agreed.
- You see the newspapers?
- Mm-hmm.
Could be a problem for me.
Yeah.
But a much bigger problem
if I get caught.
Oh God.
The truth is
we're joined at the hip.
I get caught, I take you down.
You get caught, you turn me in.
Guess you must've thought of that
or you would've gone to the cops.
You have no idea
what I'm thinking.
I know you wouldn't be here
if you didn't have
a little larceny in your veins.
How much do you want?
I don't know.
You were married to her.
How much do you think
she was worth?
I'll give you $5,000.
Oh, I bet you have a lot more
than that in your suitcase.
That's it.
I don't want your money.
I wanted your wife.
Don't you ever mention
my wife again!
Whoo.
Hmm?
Over there? Okay okay.
Shit.
Oh.
Come on, come on, come on.
You live in Crete?
No, I'm an American.
Traveling alone?
Uh, no.
No no, I'm...
- Yes?
- Is this your son?
Uh, well...
Dad, he wants to know
if I'm traveling alone.
Yes sir. I...
we were just in separate lines.
Is there a problem?
No, you can go.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Don't do anything stupid.
Get your hands off me.
Now what?
- I'm going to the airport.
- Me too.
- What are they saying?
- Shh!
They think she was robbed.
They didn't find
anything on her.
What else?
Who are they describing,
you or me?
- Do you speak English?
- Yes sir.
- What's your name?
- Kynthia.
Kynthia?
Very nice.
Bobby, Bobby Weidican.
We, uh...
we'd like two seats
on the Frankfurt flight.
Let me check, sir.
Go sit down and I'll take
care of the tickets.
Give me your passport.
Just a second, sir.
Frankfurt, huh?
Yeah, didn't your old man
teach you German?
You know, I saw a picture
of you with your father
in your little poem book.
Looked like he cared
a lot about you.
Looks can be deceiving.
Oh yeah.
Why didn't you go
to his funeral?
'Cause he wouldn't
have wanted me there.
The problem is
we expect too much from them.
When I was a kid, I looked up
at my father like he was a God.
Then you grow up...
And they disappoint you
a little more every day.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna get a drink.
You want something?
- Coffee?
- No.
Welcome aboard
flight OA 180 to Istanbul.
Our captain has informed me
that our flight time will be
approximately
one hour and 30 minutes.
Guess you should've killed me
when you had the chance?
- Where are you calling from?
-
How'd you find me?
I asked the girl
at the ticket counter.
Then I called every hotel in town, Mr.
Weidican.
or I'm gonna give your new
identity to the feds.
Listen, why don't you come over
and we can have
a drink and talk about it.
I don't think so.
Café sultan,
jewelry quarter,
grand bazaar, 20 minutes.
You shouldn't have tried
to frame me for her murder.
We're gonna need a confession...
- Or the deal's off.
- Yeah, I know.
You want something to drink?
I'm afraid
they don't serve alcohol.
I'll have whatever
you're having.
I see your old man
taught you Turkish too.
You might find
this hard to believe,
but I missed your company.
You're the only person
left in the world
I can have an honest
conversation with.
- You have it on you?
- Mm-hmm.
It's all I have.
No, 10,000 won't do.
You should be paying me.
When we first met,
you were shortchanging
college girls.
Now look at you...
a real criminal.
There's something else I want.
I want a picture of Colette.
Take your pick.
Was that even her real name?
Colette?
Why'd you try and frame me?
Do you really have to ask?
Because she liked me?
You know I slept with her.
She wanted me to.
She wanted a way out.
That's all you meant to her...
some callow kid
she would've forgotten
in a minute.
Then why did you kill her?
She was the one thing
I cared about.
Now why would I kill her?
I don't expect you to
understand now, but one day
you're gonna wake up and you're
gonna look in the mirror
and you're gonna see someone who's
not all that different from me.
And you're gonna realize
that every hope and dream
you ever had has slipped
through your fingers.
And all you've got,
if you're lucky,
is someone like her.
That's what you took from me.
That's what I took from you?
You tried to kill me.
And you killed her.
Admit it.
Admit it.
Let's go for a walk. I don't
wanna give you the money here.
Welcome, sir.
Hello.
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
No, wait wait. No.
Let me talk to him.
Let me talk to him!
You wearing a wire?
Is Chester McFarland.
I'm responsible...
For the death
of a private detective...
And the death of my wife.
Rydal keener...
Had nothing to do with it.
I framed him.
Sorry I disappointed you.
Our embassy will arrange
for your repatriation.
You're free to go home.
Where will he be buried?
We haven't been able
to trace any next of kin,
so he'll be buried here.
Why?
Thought I'd go to his funeral.
