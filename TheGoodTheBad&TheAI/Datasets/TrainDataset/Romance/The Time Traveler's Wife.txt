I can't sing.
ANNETTE:
That was fine, Henry.
HENRY:
I can't sing like you.
Of course not.
You're supposed to sing like you.
Dad says I can't carry a tune
in a wheelbarrow.
ANNETTE:
Dad was joking.
I love your voice.
We both love your voice.
How about "Jingle Bells"?
That you can sing.
Mommy!
Henry.
ANNETTE:
"...for the third time and said:
'What will you give me
if I spin the straw for you this time also? '
'I have nothing left that I could give,'
answered the girl.
'Then promise me, if you should
become queen, your first child.'
'Who knows whether that will ever happen? '
Thought the miller's daughter."
- No! Mommy!
- Henry. Henry.
- There's nothing you can do. No. Shh.
- Let me go! Mommy!
There's nothing you can do.
Listen. Listen to me.
I don't have much time.
You were in the car. It was spinning.
And all of a sudden...
...you were home
and it was two weeks ago...
...and you were watching yourself.
Watching your mom and dad read to you.
You time-traveled, okay?
Just like I did to come to see you.
I'm you, Henry. Understand?
When you're grown up.
We're the same person.
I know that's hard to understand,
but you will someday.
WOMAN:
Oh, my God.
I have to go now.
But you don't need to be afraid, Henry.
You're gonna be okay, I promise.
WOMAN:
Help that little boy!
- That took you long enough.
- You have no idea.
Okay.
So Christmas Eve. Got any plans?
Yeah, yeah. Big plans.
WAITRESS: Anything else?
- No, thank you.
Merry Christmas. Thank you very much.
MAN : Good morning, Chicago.
ChiTown radio time is 8 a.m.
News and sports are coming up next.
Shaping up to be a warm first day of spring
here in the Windy City.
Excuse me. I'm looking for something
on papermaking at Kelmscott.
Our special-collections librarian
can help you with that.
Can I help you?
Henry?
Yes?
Henry.
It's you.
You told me this would happen.
I'm supposed to act normal,
but I'm not really acting very normal.
I'm sorry.
I really have no idea who you are.
I'm Clare.
Clare Abshire.
Now, I know...
I know you don't know me.
Look, I know how odd this must be for you.
It's odd for me.
But, um...
...would you like to have dinner with me,
and I'll explain?
Henry, we've been planning this dinner
for a long time.
We have?
Go to the Beau Thai. It's your favorite.
- It is.
- Mm-hm.
You look like you've been
having a hard time.
You know, everything's gonna be okay.
So, um, is it "yes," then, to dinner?
Okay.
Okay.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Yeah. Um...
- So Beau Thai, 7.
HENRY: Mm-hm.
See you there.
Oh, shit.
COP 1: Hey.
HENRY: Oh, man.
Going somewhere, asshole?
I wouldn't bother.
Yeah? Why's that?
- You'll see.
COP 2: Shut up.
- Dispatch, Unit 11.
DISPATCHER : Go ahead, 11.
I got a...
Jesus Christ.
WAITER: Would you like another glass?
- Sure. Thank you.
Sorry. I was, uh, detained.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, no big deal.
Thank you.
You do understand
why it is I don't know you?
Uh, of course.
When you're older,
you'll travel back to when I'm a little girl.
For me, ahh...
I mean, I've known you since...
Since I was 6 years old.
Since, um, you appeared in the meadow
behind my parents' house...
...where I used to play.
Um...
You're not really supposed to drink.
Why's that?
Well, you told me that Dr. Kendrick said
that you should stop drinking...
...because it makes you travel.
- Who's Dr. Kendrick?
- He's your doctor.
He wins the Berger for his work in genetics.
He... He helps you.
This is too much.
I'm sorry.
You told me to go easy on you,
and, um, I'm not.
Ahh...
I wrote down every time
that you came to visit me.
Which I gather I did, or will do,
fairly often.
The last time that I saw you, I was 18.
Seems that you go back
to the same places a lot.
Yeah, it's like gravity.
Big events pull you in.
I was a big event.
So it would seem.
Clare, right?
Yeah.
Could we pretend just for a minute
that this is the first time we've met?
Okay.
Sure.
It's just that...
It's just that you're my best friend.
I've been in love with you all my life.
CLARE: Is this really necessary?
HENRY: Yeah. Count to 1000.
CLARE:
Ahh...
Okay.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four hundred.
Six hundred.
Eight hundred.
A thousand.
Do you want a drink?
I don't want a drink.
God, you're so young.
HENRY:
Tell me again.
How did we meet?
You're older than you are now.
Maybe I'm not supposed to tell you.
Well, I think I need to know.
Who's there?
HENRY:
Greetings, Earthling.
Mark, you idiot.
HENRY: Ow! Clare, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Just please don't throw anything at me.
Who are you, how do you know my name,
and why can't you come out?
HENRY:
Can you just hand me the blanket?
Maybe I should call my mom.
HENRY:
No, no, no. Don't call your mom, please.
Just hand me the blanket and I'll leave.
What do you need the blanket for?
HENRY:
I'm a time traveler.
I come from the future.
And when I do,
I don't get to bring my clothes.
There's no such thing as time travelers.
Yes, there is.
In fact, you and I are friends
in the future.
- When you're a lady.
- Am I pretty?
Yes.
Very.
Prove you're from the future.
Well, your name is Clare Abshire.
Born May 24th, 1972.
- Your parents are Philip and Lucille...
- So you know things.
That doesn't prove
you're from the future.
Okay.
This weekend, your brother, Mark,
who's a real pain in the ass...
...falls out of a tree and breaks his arm.
Yeah, but I won't know till then
if you're telling the truth or not.
Well, if you hang around long enough,
you'll see me disappear.
But you just got here.
I'll be back again.
Lots of times.
In fact...
...I'll be back next Tuesday at 4.
And it'd be great if, when you come then,
you could bring me some clothes.
Something your dad won't miss.
Nice to meet you.
Don't worry about that.
It's been over for a while.
This is weird.
I never knew you at this age.
I mean, I've only known you as this...
...mature, worldly person.
I'm competing against myself.
No.
You were just kind of my perfect guy.
CLARE:
I just can't get used to this.
I mean, I just keep waiting for you
to disappear.
HENRY:
Oh, it'll happen, believe me.
How's it feel?
I mean, I know what it's like
to watch you go...
...but what's it like
to always be the one that's going?
Sometimes it feels like
you've stood up too quickly.
Your hands and feet are tingling,
and then they're not there at all.
Sometimes it feels like your attention
has wandered just for an instant...
...then you're standing naked someplace.
Maybe you've been there before,
maybe you haven't.
You don't know how long it's gonna last,
so you start walking...
...till you find some clothes.
Then you seem just like everybody else.
Except you're stranded and all alone,
just waiting to disappear.
CLARE:
But you get to see people from the past.
People who are gone, like your mom.
Yeah, but the thing is,
you can't change what happens to them.
I've tried. It just happens anyway.
HENRY: It's nice. Hey.
- And this is Charisse, my roommate.
- Hi.
CLARE: My best friend.
- And our excellent cook for tonight.
- Welcome.
Because I don't cook.
Well, you should know that going in.
She's a lovely girl, but she can't cook toast.
- Gomez?
- Yeah, short for Gomolinski.
It's really nice to meet you.
We didn't wanna meet you, but seems to be
the only way to catch a glimpse of Clare.
CHARISSE:
Please ignore Gomez.
- Do you want some wine?
- No, thanks.
Do you want some water?
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?
You didn't tell me how cute he was.
He's not that cute.
Doesn't talk much either.
I couldn't get anything out of him
except he's a librarian.
Well, maybe if you would stop
interrogating him...
You never had a boyfriend.
You spend every minute with the guy.
- Wondering what the draw is.
- Leave her alone.
She's codependent. You thought
she was gonna dodge that bullet?
I don't know.
I just think he's not that cute.
All right,
so can we put the potatoes in yet?
Or do you wanna wait
until the vegetables are done?
CHARISSE: Where's the pan?
GOMEZ: How do I know?
CHARISSE: You can help.
GOMEZ: I don't even live here.
CHARISSE: You...
GOMEZ: First, I'm a man.
Second of all, I'm a guest here.
Are you reading my diary?
Told you that was private.
- I didn't read it.
- Well, it kind of looked like you did.
I was trying to find the dates.
The dates that I go to see you.
So I could tell the little girl in the meadow.
If I'm that important to her...
...I wanted to tell her when I was coming
to see her so she wouldn't have to wait.
Christ, I'm sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I should go.
I'd like you to stay.
WOMAN:
You were there all night.
MAN 1: Come on, kick his ass.
MAN 2: Guys, check this out.
MAN 3: Come on, he's a fag. Kick his ass.
MAN 4: Oh, no.
Come on.
Hey, hey, hey. Break it up, break it up.
- Henry.
- Gomez.
What are you doing?
Goddamn homophobe.
Dude, what in the hell are you wearing?
- What's the date?
- What do you mean, "what's the date?"
- What year?
- What do you mean, "what year?"
- Forget it. I gotta get some clothes.
- Yeah, the pink's not working for you. Hey.
GOMEZ: What are you doing now?
- Picking a lock.
GOMEZ: Huh?
- Close the door.
You wanna tell me what the hell's
going on here? What are you on?
Seriously.
Hey, you know, if you have a problem,
maybe I can help.
Yeah, right.
I don't give a shit about you,
but Clare I care about.
- Why don't you tell me what this is about?
- You wanna know? I'm gonna tell you.
Because you and I are gonna be friends
for a long time.
You might as well know now.
- Know what?
- I look older, right?
That's because I am.
I've come back to this night
from the future.
I'm a time traveler.
Oh, my God, you are out of your mind.
Started when I was 6 years old.
I have fits. I disappear.
I travel through time.
I've come to this night from 2003.
What year is this?
- 1995. I don't like this.
- I get dislocated in time.
I never know when it's gonna happen
or where I'm gonna end up.
I have to break and enter,
steal clothes from the first person I see.
You name it, I've done it.
Uh-huh.
There's something wrong with you.
Yeah, there is.
But I care about Clare more than you can
imagine, so don't worry about that.
GOMEZ:
Whoa, hey, I'm reassured.
Listen, in the future,
do Charisse and I get married?
Do I go bald? Does Charisse go bald?
I'm not gonna tell you things
about your life.
- Knowing stuff in advance makes you crazy.
- You're full of shit, you know that?
- You won't think that in a minute.
- Yeah? Why's that?
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Charisse is out.
- Henry here?
- No, he's at the library.
- Don't marry him, Clare.
- What?
- Just don't marry Henry, okay?
- You know, he hasn't asked me yet.
- Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.
I love him.
Here. Come here.
I saw him last night at the Vic.
Barrel of laughs. First, he beats up a guy,
then we burglarize the Army-Navy store.
And then he tells me
that he's a time traveler.
You know,
because he travels through time.
And did you believe him?
Um...
Not until he disappeared
right in front of me, you know?
Like, he just disappeared.
Yeah, it's a problem.
- Are you saying you know about this?
- I've known for a very long time.
Okay, I don't know
what the hell's going on, all right?
I don't need to know how the whole thing
works, because I don't care.
But, uh, just presuming for a second that
we're not all out of our fricking minds...
...whatever Henry has, it's, uh...
It's not good.
I've been waiting for him my entire life,
and now he's here.
I mean, it's already happened.
I couldn't even change it if I wanted to.
Well, you're worse off than I thought.
Maybe I am.
MAN:
That guy stole my wallet. My wallet!
That guy stole my wallet. Hold the train.
Excuse me.
- Are you Annette DeTamble?
- Yes.
I love you.
I mean, your work. Your singing.
You have a great voice.
Thank you. I appreciate that.
People don't usually recognize me.
Not on the subway, anyway. Ha, ha.
My name's Henry.
How funny.
I have a son named Henry.
But he's just 3.
I met a girl.
And since I've been with her, I feel safe.
I haven't felt that way for a long time.
Not since I was a kid.
I wish she could hear you sing.
Maybe she will one day.
I'm really glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you too.
Make sure that girl knows
how you feel about her.
Your son loves you very much.
I know.
HENRY:
Hello?
Dad?
What are you doing here?
I was worried.
I called you several times.
I've been ill.
Yeah.
- I called the orchestra.
- Hmm.
They told me you've been on sick leave
since September.
August.
Makes it hard to play the violin.
HENRY:
That's not gonna help.
Sure it does.
- Want one?
- No.
I don't drink anymore.
Pity.
It was our one shared enthusiasm.
First thing we gotta do is get someone
in here to clean the place up.
Make you some meals.
I mean, do you even eat?
I mean, do you want me
to come around more often?
Take you to the doctor?
- Help pay some bills? What?
- No.
No? "No" to what, everything?
Or just some of that?
Get your own life in order
before you start telling me how to live mine.
I'm getting married.
Who would marry you?
- Does she know about...?
- She knows everything about me.
Everything.
Her name's Clare.
Clare Abshire. She's an artist.
I'd really like to give her
Mom's wedding and engagement rings.
That's why I'm here.
And I think Mom would really like that.
How would you know what your mother
would like? You barely knew her.
I knew her.
I still know her now.
I've just seen her on the subway.
I see her pushing me in the stroller.
You know, I see her with you too.
This thing I have isn't always a curse.
Then why don't you keep her
from getting into that goddamn car?
I would if I could. You know that.
I've watched her die hundreds of times.
I can never get there in time to change it.
I still miss her.
I miss her every day.
So do I.
Henry.
I never wanted to have anything in my life
that I couldn't stand losing.
But it's too late for that.
It's not because you're beautiful
and smart and perfect.
I don't feel alone anymore.
Will you marry me?
No.
I didn't mean that.
I just wanted to try it.
I just wanted to say it...
...to assert my own sense
of free will. I...
But my free will wants you.
- So it's a yes?
- Yes.
Of course.
A thousand times yes.
MARK: You ever handled a gun before?
HENRY: Not exactly. L...
- Hello?
- Mom, we're home.
MARK:
You are in for a treat, my friend.
Oh, my God. That dress looks like
it's been through the wars.
- I told you to have it shipped.
- Mom, it'll be fine.
Henry, I don't mean to be a nag,
but any word on your father?
- We'll need to adjust the seating plan.
- I'm not sure he'll make it.
Shame. He could've joined in
on the killing spree.
It's how men bond, apparently.
- Philip.
PHILIP: Pull.
LUCILLE:
Philip, they're here.
Are you ready for this? It's a real circus.
Yes, I am, sir.
Hope you know what you've signed on for.
With Clare, I mean.
I'm not sure I understand.
Her mother and I didn't succeed in
preparing her for the real world, I'm afraid.
I don't know about that.
She seems to manage pretty well
for herself.
Well, that's good to hear.
Do you ever do any hunting?
No. Never.
Well, maybe I could
take you out sometime.
I'd like that. Yeah.
Usually I'm the one who's getting chased.
You know what they say.
Life's a hunt.
BARBER: Good morning.
HENRY: Morning.
BARBER:
Have a seat.
What can we do for you today?
- Cut it off.
- All of it?
Yeah, I'm getting married tomorrow.
And my wife, she likes short hair.
Congratulations.
See what we can do for you.
Try to make you happy, the both of you.
PORTER: Take your bags?
RICHARD: I've got it. Thank you.
PORTER:
Very well.
Dad. You came.
Well...
...I suppose I'll have to meet her parents.
Her dad's a Republican.
And a hunter.
Oh, dear.
HENRY:
Give us a second. I gotta take a Valium.
Valium? Is that a good idea?
Wouldn't be a wedding without a groom.
Freak.
You okay in there?
Oh, shit.
MAN: Let me get this for you, ladies.
WOMAN: Thank you.
- This hair, it's always been difficult.
- Mom. Stop already, okay?
It's fine.
But, my God, you are beautiful.
When Henry sees you
coming down the aisle...
...he's gonna pass out on the spot.
Could you go check on the boys?
Okay. Oh, God.
Okay. Oh, shit.
ALICIA: Are you guys nearly ready?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're good. We're fine.
Great day for a wedding, huh?
Flowers look really pretty and everything.
Everyone else is downstairs waiting.
What do you want me to tell Clare?
We'll just probably be, like, another
half an hour or so to get pretty, and then...
And then, you know, put some pants on,
and then we'll be ready to go.
Five minutes.
I'll let Clare know.
GOMEZ:
What year are you from?
- You look like my grandpa.
- Don't worry. It all works out.
Oh, great.
I just hope no one notices the gray hair.
You're not gonna have time to shave.
I don't know where they are.
Good luck, darling.
He's got gray hair.
What the hell?
Don't swear. We're getting married.
We are gathered here today to celebrate
the marriage of Henry and Clare.
In the presence of family and friends
and before God, they exchange these vows:
To have and to hold from this day forward,
for richer or for poorer...
...for better or for worse,
in sickness and in health.
And now I'd like to invite
my lovely daughter...
...and my gallant new son-in-law
to the dance floor.
Howdy, stranger.
Sorry I missed the ceremony.
You didn't.
Do you wish I was him?
But you are.
CLARE:
I wonder if I'm a bigamist.
I think you're allowed to marry the same
person as many times as you want.
Oh, no. Don't.
Finally.
- Clare.
- Who'd you expect?
I brought you a turkey leg.
Our cook roasts the best turkey around.
Well, that's what everyone says, anyway.
My dad was saving it for lunch.
He's been ignoring me,
so I really didn't think he deserved it.
He's been ignoring my mom too.
Alicia says they're really gonna
get a divorce this time.
They're not.
You never told me
anything like that before.
Well, I don't want you to worry
if you don't have to.
Maybe they should get a divorce.
Yeah, maybe.
Are you married?
Yes, I am.
- Is your wife a time traveler?
- No. No, thank God.
Do you love her?
Yes. Very much.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I was just hoping
you're married to me.
BETTE DAVIS :
Did you ever think about time?
It goes, Alec.
That's the business of time.
Tick, tick, tick...
I was with you in the meadow.
You were?
You were jealous of my wife.
I was.
I used to try and convince myself...
...that you were married to someone fat
with a mustache.
Well, that is my type.
CLARE:
Come on, let's do this.
- That's great, guys. Thanks.
- You're welcome.
CLARE:
Honey?
MAN:
Get him, Charlie.
Drop it.
MAN:
Get back here, you son of a bitch.
You're back.
Did I miss Christmas?
Yeah. And New Year's.
Henry, you've been gone two weeks.
I couldn't get back. I tried everything.
Even got drunk trying to trigger it.
Guess that didn't work.
Um, I have to go.
Now? I just got here.
I know, but I have a show in two weeks.
Jeremy gave me a space to work in.
I mean, this place is too small.
I can't work here anymore.
And, Henry, my life doesn't stop
because you're gone.
I never said it did.
- Could we talk about this?
- Talk?
I have been here for two weeks
wanting to talk to you.
What do you wanna talk about?
I mean, how bad it feels to sit here
and wait for you?
I'm going to work.
JEREMY:
This is gonna be great. Have no worries.
CLARE:
All right. Thank you, sir.
JEREMY: Good night.
CLARE: Good night.
WOMAN: Yeah, I can't believe that.
MAN: Yeah.
- We'll never make it in time.
- In time for what?
Somewhere in America, moments from now,
there could be a new multimillionaire.
Good evening, everybody. I'm Dave Long.
It's Tuesday...
CLARE: You can't be in here.
HENRY: We have to watch something.
CLARE: The TVs are gonna set you off.
HENRY: We have to watch something.
MAN : To win, all you have to do...
CLARE: What's that?
MAN :
Good luck.
What'd you do?
MAN :
Our first winning number is...
- Seventeen.
MAN : Seventeen.
Up next:
- Maybe a 23.
MAN : Number 23.
Or even a 32.
MAN :
Thirty-two is next.
- Couldn't possibly be a 40.
MAN : Followed by 40.
- That shouldn't be a 12.
MAN : And our last number is...
...a 12.
So here are your winning numbers:
- Seventeen, 23, 32, 40 and 12.
- You just won $5 million.
You can't do that.
It's... It's cheating.
- Okay. Let's rip it up.
- No.
Look, there are a lot of downsides
to my condition, okay?
But this is not one of them.
REALTOR: Exquisite plasterwork
in every room of the house.
Isn't it gorgeous?
This is not it.
- But I like it.
- You'll like another one more.
Just look at the fireplace.
It's got the "wow" factor.
The details, the architecture,
the windows.
- Spectacular.
- No. Not the one.
Uh, thank you.
Just look at this landscaping.
Wouldn't you love to see it in the spring?
Now, it's a little smaller
than the other places, but big on charm.
Now, the main entrance of this house
is actually towards the rear...
...where there is a charming garden.
But look at these features. The fireplace.
That staircase, it's so handsome.
The wide-plank flooring. Love that.
Clare.
- We're home. See the garage?
- Uh-huh.
- That's your studio.
- Aah!
HENRY:
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
CLARE:
So here's the garden.
- And over there is my studio.
CHARISSE: Oh, my.
GOMEZ: Things are going okay.
CHARISSE: This is...
CLARE: Mint?
- Yes.
- And black for you.
GOMEZ: Mm-hm.
- How many more of these do you want?
- Three's good.
CHARISSE:
He's awake.
- He's kicking. Max is kicking.
CLARE: Oh!
Do you know when you're gonna die?
No.
I've never seen you older.
I've never seen you older
than 40-something.
Never.
Maybe you stop...
Maybe you stop traveling.
Somebody... Somebody finds a cure.
There's gotta be some kind of drug
you can take. There's gotta be someone...
Something. Something that can help.
We're having a baby.
What?
I...
I think it's time.
It's time you find Dr. Kendrick.
How did you say you found me?
When I'm older...
...I travel back in time to see my wife
when she's a little girl.
She says I mentioned a Dr. Kendrick.
I found three in the Chicago area:
One an ENT, one a podiatrist, so...
I'm a geneticist.
And I have a genetic anomaly.
It's called Chrono-Impairment.
That's a term you came up with, apparently.
That's what she says.
Of course, now I've mentioned it,
you will call it that...
...and it'll be hard to tell
which came first.
You see, that's the thing
about time travel.
Did my students put you up to this?
Because, man, you are good.
Oh, God.
You got me.
I knew this would be a waste of my time.
Wait a minute. Uh, wait. Here.
Henry, wait.
Hey.
I lost the baby.
Kendrick.
Mr. DeTamble.
My wife had a miscarriage.
I am very sorry about that,
but I don't see what I can do to help.
What if the baby's a traveler like me?
What if it has the same genetic anomaly?
What if it traveled out of the womb?
You need help.
Not the kind of help I can give you.
How can I prove it to you?
You can't. It's impossible.
Well, just do one test.
If you don't find anything, fine. I'll leave
you alone, you can go back to your life.
I'm calling Security.
The grant.
The Berger Grant.
- Have you applied for it yet?
- How did you find out about that?
You win.
We're going to start the first series.
It'll take about 10 minutes.
Oh, shit.
Your brain emits a blast
of electromagnetic energy...
...akin to an epileptic's
right at the moment you travel.
And you can see it right here.
Now, there are drugs for epilepsy
we can use.
But all of these drugs
are way too strong for a fetus...
...if, indeed, it is a similar condition
which is causing the miscarriage.
I'm 10 weeks in now,
and we've never been that far along...
...so maybe the baby isn't gonna travel.
We're going to find out.
We're going to take a look
at Henry's genetic code.
We'd like to take a look
at the clock genes.
And then I would like to run the same test
on the fetus.
Not to worry.
It's a noninvasive extraction of cells.
But perhaps we'll get
some sort of indication...
...as how to bring you to full term.
Honey.
- What?
- Wake up. You're bleeding.
What?
HENRY:
We could adopt.
What's wrong with me wanting
one normal thing in my life?
I wanna be a mother.
I wanna bear a child, your child.
Why can't I have that?
I've never seen us with a baby. Never.
I've traveled to the future...
...and I've never seen it.
- I don't wanna hear that.
- You heard what the doctor said. You'd be...
- Stop.
Okay, Henry.
Uh, just to be official about this,
I need to ask you one last time:
- You're sure you wanna do this?
- Yeah, yeah. I've signed the papers.
Yeah. Yeah, I know, but, uh, vasectomy's
rarely a one-party decision.
Yeah, well, this time it is.
NURSE:
You all right?
- You need us to call someone?
- No.
NURSE:
A cab?
CLARE:
Henry.
Hey. What's the matter?
I don't really feel like being here
right now.
Is it me?
No.
I did something.
It was hard, and you won't like it.
What'd you do?
You won't like it.
Well, then why'd you do it?
- To stop us from fighting.
- We're fighting?
Why?
Well, just once, one time, could you...?
Could you tell me the answer
to something I'm asking you?
You wouldn't get it anyway.
That wasn't very nice.
You've never kissed me before.
I was with you in the meadow.
- When?
- You looked about 18.
It was our first kiss.
Hmm...
You were having a bad day.
I did something.
I did something I felt I had to do.
Oh, please don't tell me something
that's gonna make me hate you.
I had a vasectomy.
I'm not gonna have a child...
...with the same genetic disorder as me
who's gonna die. L...
I'm not gonna do it.
How dare you?
You tricked me.
You...
You came to that meadow...
...and you forced yourself into the heart
and the mind of a little girl.
What, you think that I wanted this life...
...this husband that disappears
without any kind of warning?
Do you think anyone would want that?
Who would want that?
- You have a choice.
- I never had a choice.
Hello?
Thanks for coming.
It's freezing out there.
Where's Henry?
Uh, I left him sleeping.
I needed some time away from him.
How's that working out for you?
You okay?
We had a fight.
It was bad.
Yeah, well,
he can be a pain in the ass, that guy.
It's really good to see you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What's up with you?
What?
You're weird.
Been weird all week.
I'm pregnant.
Do you remember the night
in the parking lot?
When I came to get you?
You were younger.
Before the surgery.
I mean, it's not like I cheated on you.
If we lose this baby,
if something happens to...
From now on...
...we're not gonna fight anymore.
We're not even getting excited.
I mean, if stress is what's causing
the traveling...
...then we should give this baby
the most serene gestation on the planet.
Eighteen weeks and perfectly healthy.
And you asked about the sex.
It's a girl.
It's a girl.
It's got a really strong heartbeat.
What about "Mia"?
That's really pretty.
Where'd you get the book?
From Charisse.
"Jane"?
I used to name all my dolls Jane.
I'm not sure
we should be talking names yet.
I'm just getting some ideas.
GIRL: Look, there's a man in there.
MAN 1: See that?
GIRL: Oh, yeah. Oh, look.
BO Y: Doesn't have any clothes on.
MAN 1: What is he doing in there?
- Shit.
MAN 2: Check this out.
GIRL 2: Wow, I don't believe that.
- What's he doing?
GIRL 3: I don't know.
MAN: Come down this way.
GIRL: But I wanna see the lion.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
- This is the first time we've ever met.
- How do you do?
- How old are you?
- Ten. How about you?
Thirty-eight.
So tell me about you. How's school?
What are you learning?
Well, not much at school.
But I read all the time. I read about Egypt.
Mom and I are reading
The Lord of the Rings.
And Grandpa's teaching me the violin.
And I heard Grandma sing.
It was beautiful. At the opera. Aida.
- What, you time-traveled?
- Mom says you and I are exactly alike.
Except Dr. Kendrick says I'm a prodigy.
Because sometimes
I can choose where I go.
You can control it?
When you go and when you come back?
I'm learning.
I saw you and Mom walking in the street
before I was born.
You walked right by me.
- You were arguing.
- I bet.
It's so good to meet you, Alba.
It's so good to see you.
Me too, Daddy. Me too.
I've really missed you.
How long has it been?
How old were you when I died? It's okay.
Five.
- Five?
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have told you.
No, no, it's okay. It's okay. I just...
I haven't traveled
past my own life before.
- How's your mom?
- She's okay.
Sad.
TEACHER:
Alba, what are you doing?
ALBA: That's my teacher.
TEACHER: Get over here right now.
HENRY: You better go.
I don't want you to get in trouble.
Come here.
Go.
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too, honey.
Alba.
Alba?
We name her Alba.
- You met her?
- Yeah.
She's so beautiful.
And so smart.
You're gonna love her so much.
So everything's gonna be okay?
Yeah.
Everything's gonna be okay.
- Push. She's coming.
DOCTOR: Deep breathing.
- Push. Come on.
- Keep going. Come on.
DOCTOR: More.
NURSE: There you go.
DOCTOR:
Good work. There you go.
Congratulations. She's beautiful.
Oh, my God. Oh.
LUCILLE:
Shh, shh, shh.
Hi.
Henry?
Do you know who Alba's playing with?
GIRL:
It's gonna happen.
- That's Alba.
ALBA: When?
Yes, but who's she with?
Your daughter.
They're both your daughter.
She's time traveling.
CLARE:
Oh.
This year.
Is it too weird?
No. I think it's kind of magical.
CLARE:
Hey. Where's Alba?
She's gone.
Honey, you wanna talk about it?
No.
- Hey. Do you want a hand?
- Nope.
Are you sure?
Okay. Okay.
CHARISSE:
That's right, sing:
CHARISSE:
Come on.
What was that about?
What was what?
Why is she so upset?
She was just sad for a minute, I guess.
Okay, what does she know?
Tell me, or I'll imagine the worst.
Go ahead and imagine it.
I mean, you're gonna do it anyway.
You all right?
Mm-hm.
Thanks.
Did you have a nice birthday?
Honey, you know,
if something's bothering you...
...you can always tell Mommy.
No, I can't.
Why not?
Because Daddy told me not to.
And you love Daddy.
But sometimes Daddy can be wrong.
You wanna tell me what it is?
It's okay if you do.
- You promise?
- I promise.
Daddy's going to die.
Who told you that?
Alba told me.
She did?
She told me that Daddy would die
when I was 5 years old.
Alba told me that you die
when she's 5 years old.
The day that you landed in the hallway,
you were shot.
That's it, isn't it?
You get shot.
I honestly don't know. L...
I'm scared.
FUTURE ALBA: It's dead.
ALBA: But why?
FUTURE ALBA:
That's just what happens.
We're born, we live,
and then when we get old, we just die.
HENRY:
Help me.
DOCTOR: How did he get hypothermia?
- We need to let them do their work.
He said that some guys were chasing him,
and it was snowing...
...and he got on this freight-car train,
and then somebody locked him in.
And... Oh, God.
They're going to save his foot.
Now, he's going to be in a wheelchair for
a few months, but he's going to be all right.
But he has to be able to walk.
He has to be able to run.
If he can't run...
ALBA:
Daddy?
Are you dying?
No.
Are you going to have to be
in this chair from now on?
Only for a little while, honey.
Things are happening fast now, honey.
I'm traveling a lot.
It might be because of
what they're giving me for the pain.
Try to stay, Daddy.
Well, how do you do it?
When I feel like I'm going...
...I sing.
I sing to myself.
Let's try that.
CHARISSE:
Clare.
- Clare.
KENDRICK: I'm calling the hospital.
HENRY:
This'll come in handy one day.
No, you need to feel it, honey.
It'll tell you when to twist.
Oh, that's my girl.
- This smells great, Mommy.
HENRY: That's ready.
- Straight over. Don't forget the baster.
CLARE: I've got it.
- Be generous.
- Yeah. It's hot.
HENRY:
Lots.
CLARE: Oh!
- Careful.
There you go. Okay, it's ready.
Done.
Look, everyone. It's snowing.
Oh, honey, your coat.
CLARE:
Okay.
There. There you go.
ALBA:
Thank you.
ALBA:
Wow!
CLARE:
It's beautiful.
ALBA:
Can we open the presents tonight?
CLARE:
What presents?
Santa doesn't come till you're asleep.
I already looked in the closet.
Alba, that closet was locked.
Christmas is in the morning.
That's the rule.
No presents on Christmas Eve.
Well, then what are we gonna do?
ALBA:
I'm gonna get you!
HENRY:
Slow down. You almost slipped there.
ALBA:
Come on, this way.
MAX:
Okay.
GOMEZ: You need anything?
- No.
- Oh, I'm good, hon.
- Okay.
HENRY: Hey, Gomez.
- Hey.
HENRY:
Come outside for a minute.
- It's cold out there.
- Don't be an old man.
Come on, just take a second.
KENDRICK: Well, I've never considered
myself a performer, but I'd like to try.
What, uh...?
What's up?
Just wanted to say
thanks for everything, man.
- You've been a great friend.
- What are you talking about?
Something might happen tonight.
All right?
And I just wanna let you know...
...that I know I've been a pain in the ass,
but you've been great.
It's all been great.
Yeah. Don't mention it.
You guys crazy?
It's freezing. Baby, put this on.
Gomez, just give us a minute, man.
ALBA:
Guys, can you believe it?
GOMEZ:
We're gonna give them a minute or two.
Henry?
No.
No.
Come here.
Come on.
Why did you let me invite
all these people?
I didn't want you to be alone.
Hey. Hey.
I wouldn't change anything.
I would not give up...
...one second of our life together.
MAN: Got it?
PHILIP: Yeah. Shh, shh.
ALBA:
Dad. Dad.
I knew I clipped it.
MAN: I don't see any tracks.
- Yeah.
Let's try over here.
CHARISSE:
Clare.
- Clare.
KENDRICK: I'm calling the hospital.
Okay.
I love you. More than anything.
I love you. I'll always love you. Always.
Stay here.
HENRY:
Alba, sweetie.
Daddy.
Oh, Henry.
Henry.
Sweetheart.
MAX:
Aah! Whoa.
- Daddy?
- Alba.
Daddy, I knew I'd see you again.
I knew it.
- How old are you? When is this?
- I'm 9.
You're 9?
And your mom still leaves clothes?
She says you never know.
You remember Max and Rosa, don't you?
Gomez's kids.
HENRY:
They're so grown-up.
Run back to the house, you guys.
Tell Mom he's here. Tell her to come.
Let's go.
ROSA:
Wait up.
Tell me the story
of how you and Mama met.
- Doesn't she tell you?
- She does, but not like you do.
Well, it was right here in this meadow.
And one fine day...
...your mom,
who's just a tiny little thing...
...goes out to the clearing,
and there's a man there.
- With no clothes.
- Not a stitch on him.
After she gives him a blanket
she happens to be carrying...
...he explains to her
that he's a time traveler.
Now, for some reason
I'll never understand...
...she believes him.
Because it's true.
Henry?
- I'm going.
- No, Daddy. Sing.
I can't sing.
Henry.
- Where are you from?
- I'm 39.
Alba's just a baby.
We're in the house. We're happy.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
I would've been here waiting.
I didn't want you to wait.
I don't want you
to spend your life waiting.
Hmm...
I love you.
I can't stay.
I know.
ALBA:
Sometimes I think he's in the trees...
...deciding when to come out
and surprise me.
CLARE: I used to think that
when I was a little girl.
That he was always here,
even when he wasn't.
ALBA:
I guess he is, isn't he?
