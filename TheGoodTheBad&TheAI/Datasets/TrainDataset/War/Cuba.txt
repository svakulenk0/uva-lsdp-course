Very good. Very good choice.
Please.
It's hot enough.
Ah.
- You'd better dry off.
- See you in the car.
- Hello, my dear.
- General.
Ramírez.
Get me the one on the right.
Darling, you go on to the airport.
I have to stop at the factory.
HAVANA - 1959
- Very hot in here.
- Sure is. Look at him.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please fasten your seat belts.
We remind you that due to
political unrest in the interior,
you are advised to contact
the military authorities
before proceeding on
to Santiago or Santa Clara.

There you go, folks. Miss Wonderley
is from Hollywood, California.
She will be appearing at the Flamingo
casino nightclub twice nightly.
There you go.
Stand back, give her some air.
She's a big breather.
- There you go, folks.
No, you wouldn't want one.
Cubana Air announces
the arrival of its DC-6 flight
It is regretted that visitors are not allowed
to come beyond the barrier

entertained here.
Cubana Airlines now boarding
flight number 571.
Major Robert Dapps?
- Absolutely. But it's Dapes.
- Of course. I am Rafael Ramírez.
Aide to General Bello,
chief of staff of the army of Cuba.
- No, thanks.
- This way, please.
No. it is not necessary. Please.
- Thank you.
- Very nice seeing you.
Sir, could you take off your jacket
and open your cases, please?
What kind of country is this anyway?
What do you have to do
to get that kind of treatment?
- Would you like me to smile?
It's simply for your safe conduct.
- Was your flight pleasant?
- Long.
Yes.
There's somebody
who wishes to speak to you.
- I take it. I take it.
- No, no, no. Nothing.
- Two pesos. Very heavy.
- Forget it!
No, no. No, no.
I don't need a taxi. I'm being met.
- Oh, come on, will you?
Major Dapes?
How do you do? Roger Maxwell-Lefroy.
Thank you.
Although we have no objections to your
being seconded to General Bello...
Seconded? He's hiring me.
...we wouldn't want any nosy people
to find out about it.
Although British government policy
is to support Batista -
delighted so to do, now that the US
has imposed an arms embargo,
shut up shop, so to speak...
However, flogging them clapped-out
old tanks and Leyland buses is one thing,
hiring out an ex-British officer
quite another.
You're not hiring me out.
I'm hiring myself out.
Incidentally, South American squares
are full of statues to soldiers of fortune.
- Mostly British.
- Yes, indeed.
And you may accept the money.
- Well, thank you.
- Oh, yes.
But if anyone asks you,
you sell tractors, right?
Tractors? I know nothing about tractors.
Ladies' underwear, then. Most soldiers
have a working knowledge of that.
But remember that, for all intents
and purposes, you are a mercenary.
You could be an embarrassment to us.
Don't think you can pop round
to the embassy if you get into hot water,
because you won't be welcome, chum.
- Larry Gutman.
- How do you do?
We've conversed on the phone.
Alex! Alex! Alex!
- Major Dapes!
- Do you know who that was?
- Yes. She is of an old Cuban family.
- She is?
- She's a Pulido.
Your photograph, sir. Photo one dollar.
Do you... Do you want to talk money?
- No.
- Quite right.
Quite right. A charming lady like you.
Let me know
when you want to talk money.
I guess your husband's busy, huh?
Yes, I imagine so.
That's why he sent you, I guess.
Very nice.
I can always talk money.

- Where's Teresa?
- She must be at work.
No, no, no. No more, Teresa.
I have to clean up.
- I love you.
- Of course you do.
But I'm in trouble already because of you.
I should have been at the airport

The United Fruit Company

that water was cut off
from a sugar mill
because he had refused to pay

which is said to be 15 cents
on every 200 pounds of sugar.

Elect as president Rivero Agüero.
Rivero Agüero was orphaned
at the age of ten.
He worked in the fields,
but at 15 he moved to Santiago,
where he studied at night
and worked by day
until he qualified as a lawyer.
This is the man Batista
would urge you to vote for
in the forthcoming election.
A man of the people, a man of the fields
and factories like yourselves.
Qualified engineers
without satisfactory employment -
your talents may ensure you
new assignments,
such as exciting DC-6 construction, or
in intermediate-range ballistic missiles.
Many more commercial

The popular singing star comes home...
- Yes, Juan?
- Is Gutman here?
Yes, he is.
Leave us alone, Ramón,
for just a moment.
Shouldn't he be shown the factory?
- Juan, I am still...
- Of course you are.
And I'm still very much in love with you.
- Are you?
- Head over heels.
A most uncomfortable position
to be in, huh?
Yes. I remember.
- What is it this time?
- Very much the same thing as usual.
I shall stop drinking.
In stages.
- I shall deal with the rest myself.
- Thank goodness.
Everything is so much better
when dealt with by you.
- Can I have some money?
- Of course.
- For what?
- For entertaining the
- All right.
- Thank you.
Juan, I know you hate it. I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
I want you to do all this. I really do.
I'm not going to manage
unless you manage me.
I need you to do it all.
Please?
- Juan, I do want you...
- Good.
Good. it's settled.
Ramón! You can come in now.
Mr Gutman. Did you have a good trip?
Señor Pulido.
- Sorry...
- Call me Juan.
- How is New York?
- Great.
Let's get you settled into your hotel.
You must want to rest.
- No, no. I'm fine.
- Excellent. I'll show you a few things.
The minister for tourism
said he expected tourism to recover

Three unknown boys were discovered
hanged in the Plaza de Armas.
- It's busy here.
- I'll take that for you.
- May I?
- No.
¿Ha visto a un señor muy alto
con un bigote que pasó por aquí?
You're required to register.
I want a room with water
which is sometimes hot.
If there's a bath to put it in,
I wouldn't mind.
Hello. Would you inform General Bello
that Major Dapes has arrived
and is at the Hotel Roma?
Yes, he knows who I am. Thank you.
- Do you have any luggage?
- Only what I'm carrying.
Without luggage
we require money to be paid in advance.
- How much?
- Whatever you care to give, sir.
No, no. No.
Well, you're bigger than I am.
- Mr President...
- I am not.
- We are holding an election for president.
- General Batista.
You can live in the security of the
United States with all your family, sir.
You have a house in Florida, sir.
All you have to do is get out, hand over
to the new president, whoever he is.
He will be Rivero Agüero.
- You gonna lift the arms embargo?
- Me? Us?
I can only speak as...
We are not privy to the...
What do you want?
We are here
to investigate the financial affairs
of the Buró de Represión
de las Actividades Comunistas.
We may not be able to continue support.
Excuse me, I think there's a problem,
General Bello.
- I've lost the Englishman.
- Wait.
Nice one!
You better go find him.
I'm paying Dapes.
Get the police to bring him.
- Sir.
- Nice to see you.
Your bash, Vicar.
- Where's the phone in this room?
- In this room it's downstairs.
- It is untrue that I'm not a good worker.
- Yes.
It's her.
She has the right.
Go.
- You tell her...
- What?
That I will not go.
Have her come in here.
- There will be a strike if I go.
- Will there?
- Almost certainly.
- You will go.
There are accepted ways of behaviour
in Cuba still.
You can't fire me.
If you don't go, I will make you go.
How?
- What's that?
- He gave it to me.
It was my mother's.
Ramón! Some money.
I will buy it from you. I'm sure that
you consider that you have earned it.
No. He never should have given it to me.
That's terrific.
Do you get to drink any of it?
Anyway, it all starts with the sugar.
With your permission, I'd like to show you.
My father, Don José Pulido, is one of
the wealthiest men on the island.
Rum, sugar, tobacco.
But we are quite separate
from the businesses run by my father.
I tell you this simply
so that you understand.
We don't need investment.
We, that is the cigar factory,
hope to encourage investment
so that we might expand.
- Would you like to meet my father?
- Yes, I would.
Ah!
- My father?
- Señor Pulido is very busy.
Tell him I'm here with a friend.
I'd like to introduce him.
- My card...
- He gave instructions...
- Tell him.
- Señor.
Your son would like to speak with you.
Father.
Might I introduce
Mr Gutman from New York?
You have met my daughter-in-law?
- I have. She's a very beautiful young lady.
- Yes, she is.
But my son is quite beautiful as well.
Handsome, charming. Like this pony.
- How do you like this pony?
- Very nice.
But I know nothing about horses.
Juan, how do you like this pony?
- It's good.
- Then I will buy it.
If there is one thing my son
knows about, it's horses.
It's the only thing he knows about,
which is why my daughter-in-law
runs my factory and Juan doesn't.
I hope he'll show you Havana.
It's wonderful.
He knows every casino,
every table and every bed in it.
He'd make an excellent travel guide.
As well as a jockey.
I'm not trying to insult my son.
I just want you to be aware of his talents.
Will you excuse me?
- Who the hell are you?
- Police.
- General Bello causes me to arrest you.
- Does he?
Hm. At once.
But... do you have any money?
Not for you, I haven't.
In that case, at once.
Radio Reloj.
And now, news time.
The rebel threat has gone down
like cane in Las Villas.
Government troops are taking
scores of rebel prisoners.
Rum and coca.
Radio Reloj brings you news
every second of the day
Oh!
No.
No more, huh?
- Well, what do you say?
- I say you are right.
- Where have you been today?
- With the
Yes?
- We're taking him to dinner tonight.
- We are?
- I think we ought to, Alejandra. I...
- You are quite beautiful.
- Aren't I, though?
- Yes, you are.
I fired Teresa Mederos.
Good. You are right.
She was becoming troublesome.
Juan.
Juan, not again. Please. Not somebody
from the factory or the house.
I do promise. I do.
Dapes. Robert Dapes.
Until recently a major in the British Army.
Served in the war. Long-range desert
group in North Africa, Kenya and Malaya,
where he commanded
the Jungle Warfare School.
He's an expert in counterinsurgency
and has no political loyalties.
Not employed since resigning
from the army. Where is he?
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.
- He was met by General Bello's aide.
- Yes, I know.
- You want something to happen to him?
- Yeah. Something.
After the election. I'll tell Castro.
The ability to read is a struggle.
Remember that to be literate
is to be liberated,
for nobody can ever fool you again.
Two words a day.
Start with "freedom". Start with "hope".
H-O-P-E spells "hope".
This is Rebel Radio.
- Can I try?
- No. Next time.
Excuse me, General.
- Major Dapes. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.
Would you be so kind?
Please wait here.
Excuse me.
Meet Mr Clean, Procter and Gamble's
new all-purpose liquid cleaner.
Skinner. Donald Skinner. Fellow exile?
- Dapes. Bob Dapes.
- Thought so.
- In...
- In?
- Line of business?
- Oh... tractors.
Tractors.
I fly aeroplanes, put out fires,
spray crops, that sort of nonsense.
Crop-spraying could really take off here,
when Bello puts the unions in their place.
He... is in the police.
You see he's all right and you'll survive.
One of the first things you do here
is to grease a palm or two, as it were.
And how much does one tip
the captain of police in Cuba?
- I usually give them all I've got.
- I see.
- Slightly less than New York.
- Yes.
Major.
Excuse me.
Major Dapes, General Bello.
General Bello, Major Dapes.
Major Dapes. Glad to meet you.
Sit down, please.
- Thank you.
- Sit down.
- You want to know something?
- Yes.
I guess I couldn't wait
until you got around to calling me.
I did call. I told them where I was.
That was very thoughtful of you,
but it was unnecessary.
- We would have found you.
- I wasn't hiding.
I'd decided
to make my own arrangements.
- Beretta.
- Yes.
- You buying or selling?
- Both.
- Major?
- No, thank you.
Major, how long were you in Malaya?
Oh, an awfully long time.
- Yes, I know.
- I imagine you do.
You want to know something?
I met a man, an American friend.
I told him that I wanted
the best counterterrorists I could find.
He told me that I have to buy British.
So here you are.
Bought.
You don't like money?
I don't like being without it.
- But you do like fighting, don't you?
- No, I don't like fighting at all.
- I try not to do too much of it.
- I do.
Have you done much?
Major, tell me what your favourite
weapon is and I'll get it for you.
- Brains.
- Brains. Yes.
You've got brains, right? Huh?
You see Ramírez here?
Ramírez is a junior officer.
He got brains.
Went to a military college.
They gave him brains.
With brains, very easy to get a promotion.
- We can make you a colonel.
- Thank you.
My friend Batista was a sergeant
until he got brains.
I was a corporal.
Then they had the revolution. The next
day I became a general with brains.
That's wonderful.
Some people stay corporals all their lives.
- Look at Hitler.
- Hitler... God rest his soul.
He was foolish enough to take on
Uncle Sam as well as the communists.
Yes. Right. That's the Second World War
in a nutshell.
- How are you going to do it?
- Do what?
- Beat Castro.
- Ah.
Minor factors can be taught in a month.
It's quite simple.
- Deny the enemy food, harry and kill him.
- What?
Harry and kill him.
Ambush him, rather than
wait for him to ambush you.
- OK. All right. What do you want?
- I need to see what you've got.
- Excuse me.
- General.
The parking meter detail.
- Did you get the money in England?
- Yes, thank you.
- I shall keep a record of my expenses.
- No, no.
Spend it. I want you to owe me.
Ramírez here is going to
show you a good time.
I want to hear you got to do everything.
If he slips up again, you tell me.
I'll take care of Ramírez in my own way.
Do you play golf?
What's your handicap? Have a cigar.
Major Dapes, I'm going to give you a pass
that will let you go anyplace
and see anything.
Only don't take too long, huh?
After all, we're fighting a war.
Yes, and rather badly I suspect, too.
See that Major Dapes
gets to harry and kill.
- There is something one ought to say.
- Say it.
You will only defeat someone like Castro
if you're right.
Is Castro right?
It's not the point.
Does Cuba think he's right?
When you're ready, Mr Dapes.
I expect to be called General.
It's important to call people
what they are, sir.
Major Dapes.
How do you work this?
- Marvin.
- Howdy.
- Ready to be beaten?
- You'll be lucky.
All right. All right.
- It's your day.
- It's straight set day.
- She's been practising.
- Oh, yeah?
Might put them off, huh?
- She's worked on her serve.
- She should have worked on her legs!
The boots are good.
Yes, Batista promised the army
good boots...
in 1934, when he was a revolutionary.
They wanted very little else then.
What do you say about
my on-court play now?
Tell me when you're gonna do that.
You know I can't get to it, Marvin.
Do you think I can mind-read?
Stay up at the net. And don't poach.
Alex.
- I knew it was you.
- Did you?
I'm Alejandra López de Pulido.
Excuse me. if you don't mind,
we're trying to play tennis.
Alejandra?
Alejandra!
I'd like to... No.
Better still, muster a patrol.
- Ten good men.
- Ten?
It will be almost impossible to find two.
Does that include you and me?
It isn't usual to go off the road.
Isn't it? No wonder you never
get to know anything.
It's the only way.
Get out, move amongst them.
Put your men on the paths
at five-yard intervals. All right?
Rafael, tell that idiot to shut up,
leave his nag behind and walk quietly.
You may tell my mother
that I am well, Núñez.
And give these to her.
Yes. Yes, you are well. Better, anyway.
We now eat more than one meal a day.
I am getting quite fat.
Bring Captain Ramírez.
- Shut up!
It's well used. How big is this plantation?
Some five miles.
if you're patient,
keep your sense of smell.
Sooner or later you'll pick up somebody
and they'll talk.
- Smell?
- Mm.
You can often smell a body of men
before you see them or hear them.
Especially if they're smokers.
Are you worried about
being late for the general?
He likes to show you off to his friends.
What happens if I don't show up?
Oh.
Hey!
Hold your fire!
Stop or I'll shoot!
Do you understand English?
I teach it.
It's a girl.
- I want to question her.
- Yes.
First you, then she is questioned
by the sergeant and each of the men
as many times as possible,
and a few days later
she is taken down to La Cabana and shot.
It would be much kinder to shoot her now.
I'm not going to hurt you.
I just want to ask you...
Get down!
Women!
Who is he?
Nobody.
Mr Gutman is in room 214.
What do you mean,
I'm not offering enough?
We are prepared to pay $10,000
for the whole goddamn operation.
Take it or leave it.
Right. Next, Skinner Air.
- What about some money?
- Hm?
- Money. Money.
- Do the bullets fit?
- What?
- Our guns.
Of course. They're 9mm,
which is what you asked for.
When we know they fit,
you'll be told and paid.
It's a pleasure to do business with you.
Shit!
Mister...
SkinnerAirline is no answer...
- Please take your shoes off.
- Will you ring Skinner Air again for me?
Are you on the house, or do I chip in?
Everything is taken care of
by Señor Pulido.
I just have to show you a good time.
OK, we'll see what we can do.
Don't you Cubans realise
that time is money?
I do.
Guns?
Hm. Stored in the premises
of Alejandra Pulido.
- And is she involved?
- Perhaps.
Whether she is or not,
she still has to be questioned.
I used to know her in North Africa.
If she is involved,
I can find out very quickly.
Don't worry. I don't like terrorists.
Especially ones I know.
Come on, come on.
- Get me a cab.
Come on.
- I've been promoted.
- Congratulations.
Batista has promoted
everyone in the army.
There are no privates any more.
Now I'm a major too.
I'll buy you a drink.
You know that the situation here
is not so good.
I think you've come too late.
I was afraid of that.
You know, soldiering has changed.
It's not as... clean as it was.
I'm still proud to be a soldier.
Why not? it's an honourable profession.
It was.
- Ready for another boring evening?
- It'll be fun. They always serve peas.
Sorry we're leaving, General,
but Mr Dulles is sending us home.
I know.
- Hello.
- We're not going far.
- But we may not be able to assist.
- It's OK. I've got an Englishman.
Oh, Don Pulido! Hello, my friend.
Here. Sit down.
Sit down next to me.
All right, everybody. Please sit down.
You can start now. Pick your own seats.
You have enough room here?
There you are.
It's pea soup.
Look out!
I don't know when I had such a good time!
I do, honey.
Is that to your liking? Very good.
- This wine's really tasty.
Rafael, get some ambulances here.
All right, my love. We'll do something.
All right?
Here, let me have that cloak.
Hey.
You unfeeling bastard.
- Fire number one!
- Number one, fire!
- Fire number two!
- Number two, fire!
- I love him.
Love! You lose your job.
I don't care.
- Your father would kill you.
- My father is dead.
No, your father is not dead.
I go every day to the prison to find out.
He's not dead.
Your brother should kill you.
Yeah, yeah. Julio. Julio?
You gonna kill me, Julio?
No, I'm gonna kill him... maybe.
No, Julio. No. Juan Pulido loves me.
- Where you get the gun?
- Go sell yourself to the
I'm gonna kill your pimp.
I don't have no pimp. I just got a man.
- You got a girl?
- I got a gun, Teresa.
- You couldn't shoot anybody, Julio.
- I hate him.
I'll give you some candy
and then you won't shoot my man.
I'll kill him.
Let me know when
and I'll tire him out for you.
Go and spend the night on the Malecón!
Let everyone buy you!
Oh, shut up!
I'm no
the Christmas show at the Flamingo
proudly presents, twice nightly...
- the wonderful Miss Wonderley!
- Sorry, fellas. They just got here.
Held up in customs.
I guess they must be pretty hot stuff.
Let's have a drink.
Let's have a drink.
- Look at this place. Where is everybody?
There's somebody delicious.
We get drinks.
We get free drinks. it's in the contract.
Skinner.
Juan, should you be
leaving Alejandra alone?
Here. Look at that.
I don't understand it.
In Miami, we'd have packed the joint.
- What's with you Cubans?
- Has Mr Gutman called?
No.
You're a Cuban.
What's the matter? You don't like broads?
I'm glad to hear it.
When Mr Gutman arrives, send him over.
Excuse me.
We get two per cent of every table.
Don't think we don't need it.
Everybody, but everybody,
in this town is on the take.
Julio.
The ammunition does fit.
What?
...does fit.
Pay Skinner... something.
OK.
Well.
Well, what?
Have we nothing to say to each other?
Yes. Of course.
I'd rather he didn't come at all.
Alejandra, I've arranged this so...
Where did you take him this afternoon?
To Father's mill, the rum factory.
- Why?
- To impress him.
Juan, you can't be satisfied
with what you have, can you?
The cigar factory is impressive enough.
- It only needs investment to be better.
- Yes, I am arranging that.
Gutman was impressed.
Juan.
You are trying. I do love you for that.
Don't laugh at me.
Thank you.
- Hello there!
- Ah!
I guess we got delayed.
Dolores is very lucky. I got lucky.
My God, is Havana wide open!
We shot a little craps. Did you eat?
I'm lucky for him.
How nice. Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Champagne, right?
- Alejandra!
- What?
I will not sit down with
that common whore.
- How dare you!
- It's the way it's done.
- Did you arrange her?
- Yes, I arranged it.
Did you?
Let me go! Gutman means nothing to me.
I can do without his money.
Ooh, honey!
There's champagne here!
Ooh, baby!
You know what I like!
Chantilly lace and a pretty face
And a ponytail hanging down
A wiggle in her walk
And a giggle in her talk
it makes the world
go round, round, round
There ain't nothing in the world
Like a big-eyed girl
To make me act so funny
Make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose
Like a long-necked goose or like a...
Ooh, baby, that's what I like!
For Skinner.
Number nine.

Hello, Mr Dapes. You are early.
- I am very lucky.
- Are you?
- It appears I'm not.
- I like your photo very much.
- Oh! it's lipstick, huh?
- No, actually, it's blood.
Oh, shaving.
I like a man who shaves smoothly.
Rafael.
Major Dapes, I find the role of procurer
very distasteful to me.
- So if you don't like her, then...
- You don't like me?
But I am beautiful.
Yes, you are. it's just that
I try to avoid that which I cannot afford.
Oh! it's OK. You can afford.
Come. I take you to another casino
where I am very lucky for you.
I win you maybe
two and a half thousand dollars...
- We just bought some champagne!
- Yes, but you have not bought me.
Alex!
- I must talk with you.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- You were a long time ago.
- Alex!
Hey!
- Leave the soldiers alone.
- Rafael.
Mr Gutman. Shall we?
Miguel.
Take me back.
For a second time this evening,
a big hand for a big lady.
Miss Wonderley.
Shit!
Bartender.
Robert.
I must tell you.
You could be in very serious trouble.
We must have a talk.
Yes, we must have many talks.
It is lovely to see you again. How are you?
I'm well. And you?
Fantastic.
- What sort of friends do you have here?
- Can't you do better than that?
Apart from your Wimbledon set.
I know. I'm sorry. You frightened me.
- But not now.
- I see.
What do you expect me to do now?
Kiss you?
I see no reason why you shouldn't.
It's been, as they say, such a long time.
Oh, stop it!
It seems like yesterday to me.
Really?
Would you excuse me a minute?
- Alex, about three hours ago...
- Robert.
- Did I ever know your second name?
- Of course you did!
- I did?
- You wrote to me. it got to me.
I can't have been
the only Robert in the army.
I should introduce you to my husband.
For that I need your second name.
- Juan, this is...
- Nobody?
Robert, for the life of me,
I can't remember your second name.
Dapes.
- My name is Robert Dapes.
- You must come and visit us.
Do you play polo? Would you like
to meet anyone in the government?
If there's enough money involved,
you can meet Batista himself.
What line of business?
Tractors!
Yes, go and get him!
What's going on?
Come on, get up.
You, too. Up!
- Aimed at you?
- Yes. At me.
Do you know that young man?
Good heavens, no.
I wouldn't even recognise him again.
- Did you get a good look at him?
- Good enough.
Then you are in for a very long night.
Jorge Ortiz Ruiz.
What's all this about?
- They're waiting to hear.
- To hear?
- About those that have been arrested.
- Hear what?
Major, please.
Monopoly!
Thank you.
They just can't account for $300,000
for the month of June, Spence.
I have some very suspicious
cross-entries here, Gary.
We're gonna be here for months.
These accounts are in a mess.
Well, they are experiencing a revolution.
I guess accounts do get out of hand.
No luck.
Thank you.
- Teresa, what are you doing here?
- My brother could kill you.
He's already tried.
Wait here, huh? Just wait.
Where's your wife?
Robert!
Your husband was released
some hours ago.
Yes, I know.
Come on.
Do you want to say something?
Or would you rather not?
Yes. I would rather not.
Why were you so upset at the tennis?
Yes, I was. You frighten me.
Because you threaten
to change the life I have.
How would I do that?
You already have.
I knew you would.
Where are we going?
Can't we just drive around
for a little while?
What have you been doing?
Living in Cuba. You?
Modern warfare.
Fighting people who hide grenades
in shopping baskets,
shoot up crowded hotels,
hack the legs off cattle
and leave them dying on their stumps.
That sort of thing.
- Your friends...
- I have very few friends.
Do they toss bombs around,
shoot off guns?
No. You do that.
- Rafa!
Take the posters down.
Put them on the truck at the back.
Are you married?
No. But you are.
That should be enough for both of us.
We're very happy.
I seem to remember, when I was once
deeply and ridiculously in love,
I was at the same time
profoundly unhappy.
That was me.
I did that to you. I made you unhappy.
- I adored it.
- I didn't.
Am I still beautiful? You used to think so.
I seem to remember
you were very taken with me.
As a matter of fact,
you were terrified that I was.
You got out of North Africa
faster than Rommel.
- Actually, he took his time.
- Admit it. I terrified you.
Yes, I admit it. I didn't know so much
passion could exist in one so young.
You were the most exotic,
breath-stopping creature I'd ever known.
Quite a danger to my health.
What with you and my colonel and
being shot at, I'm astonished I survived.
- Perhaps you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
By forgetting all about you.
And how did you recognise me?
You didn't forget me.
You knew me at once.
Yes, I did.
And you haven't changed at all.
I hate coming to these filthy places.
I like these places.
I like you and I like places like this.
I used to bring someone else here.
- Who? You don't still bring her?
- Good heavens, no.
She's my wife.
- When did you marry Juan Pulido?
- Five years ago.
- Any children?
- No.
He doesn't beat you,
or anything dreadful like that?
- What would you do if he did?
- Break his bloody neck.
- Would you?
- Of course.
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.
- Egg flip?
- There may be something wrong with me.
Apart from your memory?
I might be too ambitious. Too demanding.
In fact, I am.
Tell me this...
The only question you haven't asked me
is why I came to meet you.
Why did you come?
Look out!
Why did you?
With an overwhelming majority Cuba
has elected Rivero Agüero as president
General Batista has stated
that this will show the world
Free elections
in a free country of the free world
President-elect Agüero
has a hard task ahead of him,
but the people of Cuba are behind him
against communism and revolution.
- Hey. it jammed again last night.
- You want a Coke?
- I don't have any money.
- That's OK.
We want an explanation, Julio.
My sister's honour's important to me.
It was the work of a  gangster.
My father,
who is in prison if he's still alive,
he would cut the balls from Pulido.
He betrayed my sister.
You had no right to do it.
You were given a task.
Which I did.
The money for the gringo Skinner.
And you were seen.
You can't stay on campus, Julio.
I've got to. I can't flunk my courses.
It doesn't matter.
There'll be no more courses.
Now Agüero is elected,
there will be a general strike.
Here.
Here.
If you want to kill someone.
The trigger mechanism jammed.
Take the .38.
- Did you vote for him?
- No. Nobody did.
- Somebody must have done.
- Batista, who pays you.
No, I'm paid by General Bello.
Just as good.
You can be sure of your money.
Bello works the parking meters.
Batista pockets the lottery.
Don't you worry
about where your money's from?
If what you say is true,
it appears I come under "traffic of fences".
It's true.
You don't get involved in any of this, hm?
No, I don't look too closely
at things that don't concern me.
Like having your factory used.
Robert, in Cuba every building,
every factory, every hotel
is being used in some way by someone.
There are things I know nothing about,
I don't turn stones over,
and so far my workers
have not had a strike.
Even a blind eye can be poked out.
Alex...
I want you to come with me.
Where?
Where? You haven't thought about it?
It's only just being suggested to me.
Where?
With me.
Far?
- Don't play games.
- It's very short notice.
I don't see you for 15 years,
you turn up as if yesterday and say...
No. I can't go anywhere with anyone
on short notice.
I own a factory, and I do have a husband.
He would have to be told if I was
going anywhere, short notice or not.
I'm not asking you to go on a holiday!
Don't shout.
Robert, it's very nice of you,
and I know what you're saying.
But I don't really know you, do I?
You knew me when I was a silly girl of 15.
- 17.
- 15.
Who fell in love with
a handsome British soldier.
Do you know what I remember most
about you? Your knees.
You're being ridiculous.
I'm not. I'm trying to prevent you
from being ridiculous.
You're obviously not happy
with your husband.
- How do you know?
- Because you wouldn't allow me to...
I didn't allow you to anything.
- I made love to you.
- Very nice it was too.
- Yes.
- So?
- So... nothing.
- Nothing?
Nothing. Robert, please try to understand.
I have a house. I enjoy having it.
I enjoy having a husband who is a
member of a very important Cuban family.
- It's important to me.
- Rubbish!
Don't speak to me like that.
You're talking about things.
Factories, houses.
- Husbands.
- He means nothing to you.
How do you know what Juan means to me
or has meant to me? You don't.
If he means something to you,
you shouldn't be here.
- Don't pick that up.
- Don't shout.
- Then pick this up as well.
- I don't know what you're playing at.
- You're unhappy. You won't let me...
- Don't you have a job to do?
I'm going to do my job.
- Then I'll see you sometimes.
- No, you won't.
- I see.
- What did you say?
I said I see!
I'm buggered if I do.
Wait! Wait! Stop! Stop!
- Good morning.
- Get out. I'm not hungry.
I'm starving.
Oh.
Well... had a good night?
- Like to buy an aeroplane?
Not there, old man. it's outside.
The whole of Havana's on strike.
Not the whole, not yet,
but it won't be long.
I had to walk up.
The elevator's out of action.
There you are, you see. Power cut.
Now, then, let's talk about my aeroplanes.
- How much?
- How much can you offer?
- They ain't worth nothing.
- They're going to be worth a great deal.
People are going to want to get out.
And they'll want to take out
their goods and chattels.
- Have you got a car?
- Yes, a pick-up.
Even better. Here's what I'll do.
I'll buy your aircraft, I'll buy the cigars.
We'll get the cigars out.
I'll buy the Pulido place.
We'll make a delivery today.
What is the world gonna need?
Havana cigars, right?
Radio Rebelde.
Rebel Radio. Why?
But Agüero was elected because
the election was rigged by Batista.
What can you do? You can strike.
A general strike is called
This is the voice of revolution from the
men and women fighting for a free Cuba.
Batista soldiers are moving against us
but cannot win.
Strike. No telephones, no transport,
no work in the factories.
Tell us, Batista,
are you leaving now or later?
We know you have
five aircraft standing by
for those pimps, pushers, prostitutes
who are faithful to you.
Jesús promised me
there would be no strike.
Where is Jesús?
Ah, Ramón.
I think we've got a...
Very well, I will go to the rum factory first
and then I will come to you.
And, Ramón, lock up everything
and remove the money.
Everybody throughout Cuba
has stopped work.
That is apart from servants, of course.
- I phoned Señor Pulido and...
- You had no right to do that, Ramón.
I can handle this.
Your husband was shot this morning.
He lasted a long time.
Yes, he did.
I must tell Julio.
Go on.
Go on!
Go on.
Keep your stupid old mouth shut, woman,
do you hear?
We're fighting for you.
One thing I'm certain. She's not involved.
What's the drill?
Try to get her as far away from the factory
as possible, before anything happens.
Old man Pulido should be told.
He will be able to help.
Follow me!
Line them up! Line them up!
Next.
Nothing, eh? Next.
Shoot him! Shoot him!
Over there!
- Why were they shot?
- They tried to escape.
- From what?
- From being shot.
- How did they know they were rebels?
- They tried to escape.
- Wouldn't you?
- Yes.
- Are you a rebel?
- If I try to escape.
Wasn't it the same in Malaya?
- No, it wasn't.
- You're here to teach us.
I am not working...
- it's over, master.
- You're meant to be in charge!
Down with him!
- Who dared to allow...
- They dared to.
- What will you do?
- Me? Nothing.
I'm here merely
to take your leavings, Father.
Your houses, your old factories,
your old mistresses.
How dare you talk about
your wife in that way.
You would think he'd be the last drunkard
that will ever be in Cuba. Look at him!
You load the truck, I'll go do the deal.
Um...
But sure...
What is this, Labor Day?
Go on.
Señora Pulido!
Just name the price, I'll buy the works.
The factory, every goddamn cigar you got.
It's no problem.
This very day I intend to fill a plane
full of your cigars and fly to Miami.
All you gotta do is tell me how much.
You can stay here and run the factory
for me until the whole shoot collapses.
All I want is two planeloads a day.
- I bought the trucks, the planes...
- Mr Gutman.
There's a man behind you with a gun.
Oh, dear. Um...
- Agh!
- Shh! Quiet!
- I will shoot this woman.
- I don't doubt that you will.
Search him.
Search him!
- With this you can go anywhere?
- Can you read?
I read law at university.
I'm not in the least surprised.
You can't use it without me.
There's a bad likeness stuck to it.
- You'll come.
Where?
- Load the guns.
- Where are you going?
- To Santa Clara, to Fidel.
- They are for the city.
We were told to wait here.
- I'm taking them to Castro! You come too.
- Ah!
So you can say "I was a Fidelista"
before it is too late for Fidel to notice you.
I shoot her first if any of you try anything.
Put the guns in the truck
and cover them with cigars.
Get up.
Is there enough fuel to get me to Miami?
- Right.
- But the water dump tanks are full.
- Doesn't matter. I'll drop it out on the way.
Have a... whatever you drink.
You're driving very badly.
Perhaps you're not used to driving
such an expensive car.
Perhaps.
Why are you fighting
for a country that's not yours?
I will fight for any elected government
that makes me an offer for my services.
Would you fight for someone
who paid you more?
No, I would never fight with a gun
to overthrow a legitimate government.
So you decide
which governments are legitimate?
Wonderful.
Oh, God. Guerrillas.
- No, but...
- I'm...
They will come out at us
from the cane fields.
I told Batista our soldiers were too tired
and did not want to fight.
- That is a fair assumption.
- We'll see.
We must hold on to the gasoline depot.
We must not lose that.
- Have you any interest in oil?
- Yes...
I am going to speak to Castro.
I will say to him "You got to get rid of
the communists in your army."
"if you don't make a deal,
I'm going to harry and kill."
- Harry and kill. You know what I mean?
- I know what you mean.
We're full. Switch the flow onto six.
- What?
- Switch the flow onto six.
Juan, take a look at this. Come here.
Get up! Come on!
- Get up!
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco.
Probando.
If Batista's soldiers wish to surrender,
they will be well treated.
I repeat,
if Batista's soldiers wish to surrender,
they will be well treated.
It is not a disgrace
to surrender to your own revolution.
There is no honour in living a lie.
If you die now,
you will at least die a free man.
Come home. Come to us.
We are you, you are us.
Stand still where you are and listen.
When you take prisoners who have fought
for the revolution, you shoot them.
We, however, do not intend to shoot you.
You will be released, handed over to the
Cuban Red Cross and returned home.
Those who are criminals,
guilty of crimes of torture, murder,
you know who you are.
You may hide, but you'll be found.
The depot!
Tell the tanks that the gasoline depot
is swarming with Fidelistas.
I hear you. Over.
Major Dapes.
That's right.
- You said he was to be killed.
- Be quiet.
This is Colonel Leyva.
You are to attack the gas depot Over.
Chambelona Red.
- Major, you are a paid soldier.
- Of course I'm bloody well paid.
We're not paid.
- You're not soldiers.
- OK.
But though we aren't soldiers,
we're fighters.
And we are winning.
- We'll send the  home.
- I can't wait.
We'll fight the parasites
that feed on the people.
The Church, gangsters, soldiers.
Soldiers are the worst parasites.
- Don't talk to him. Kill him.
- We're not killing anyone.
- I'll kill him.
- Would you care to try without a gun?
- Give me that!
- No!
I brought guns to you!
We did need guns,
but now we need brains.
You go away and rediscover yours.
It isn't easy to be given a gun.
We make it a privilege.
What do you intend doing
about thugs like him?
It might be more to the point
to ask what they intend to do about us.
Get down!
Gutman, you can drive a car.
Then you can drive a tank.
No. What are you doing?
You want to go home? Then come on!
Pull it back! Come on!
Come on! Get out!
Hey! Look out!
Come on!
- It's just the same as a car.
- But mine's automatic.
Where's the goddamn wheel?
What are you doing?
- Pull on the sticks!
- What?
This is Colonel Leyva.
Do you hear me? Over.
- Got him!
- Who?
Get us off the road!
There's another one coming!
- Stick!
- Pull the left lever!
- Stick!
- Yes!
I can't see anything.
Keep it going.
You're over-revving.
Change gear!
You're flooding it!
Can I help?
Make bandages out of this. That way
you won't ruin your nails, sweetheart.
Pull! Pull!
Pull! Pull!
Come on, move! Get us going.
Soldier!
Someone!
Get them! Shoot straight!
Come on! Shoot!
- Shoot them!
Gutty, come on.
Come on! Move!
Quickly! Hurry up!
- You'll roast in there! Come on!
- I can't!
Back! Go back! What are you doing?
Come on!
They're gonna bomb us!
Uh? Uh? Must have been one of ours!
We've done it, Spence.
I never thought we would.
- We got them to balance.
- Sure have.
Do you want to go out
and see something of Havana now?
Sure.
Take the other one! This one's mine!
OK, but quick. Bello might come back!
Quick, let's go!
Pack your things as quickly as you can.
It'll take time to clear you with the British
Consulate and arrange your ticket.
I'll send the car back from the airport.
Where has she been, my wife?
With you?
Yes. She's been with me.
- Am I expected to take her back?
- No, you're bloody well not.
- Where are you taking her?
- Out of Cuba.
Why?
Cuba won't change.
A few people will leave. My father
will go away for a while, so will Batista,
and then they will both come back.
And once again Batista will get his face
on the front of  magazine.
Whatever you say, I want her out of here.
Stop talking about me as if I'm not here.
Robert, you don't understand.
I don't want to leave Cuba. Ever again.
I regard those years spent away
as lost time.
There was nothing,
and I include you, Robert,
nothing that made them memorable.
No, I cannot go with you.
Stay here with me.
Robert,
I know what I've done to you and me.
But if you take me away from here,
I wouldn't seem the same to you.
- You don't understand, do you?
- You're right I don't understand.
I don't understand you or him
or his father or even myself,
sitting here bloody well discussing...
Hey!
Get in.
I'll send the car back.
It's up to you.
What do you think will happen to you?
Mind your own business, señor.
Thank you. That seems
a perfectly reasonable reply, chum.
It's not like you to be so unselfish.
It's not like you to notice.
Where are the keys to the sports car?
In the car. Where are you going?
For a drive.
You will be back?
Pan American regret to announce
that all scheduled flights are cancelled
You will be informed
when aircraft are available.
Please hold on to your tickets
and await further information.
Hey, sweetie, come here.
Thank you.
There are no prospects of any
further flights in the foreseeable future.
Seats will be allocated
on a first come, first served basis.
- It's Batista!
- Running away!
He is going again! Look!
Batista!
The ship must be sinking.
Cubana Air. The excess baggage
regulations will not be waived
Please make sure you are only carrying
that which is absolutely essential.
No! Leave it! Come on!
The forces of the revolution
are on their way to Havana.
At their head is the man
they call "El Caballo", Fidel Castro.
They arrive in buses, carts,
anything with wheels.
It has taken seven days
for this march up the Carretera Central.
- Mummy! Soldiers!
- Keep quiet and come with me.
Goodbye.
Ahh.
Everybody, make a line here, please.
Those who want to go, you go.
Please take your cases
and pass through customs.
This way, please.
Would all ticket holders please move
in an orderly manner towards the gate?
Give this to Alex Pulido if she shows up.
I can't wait.
We talk to his comrades,
the men who have fought with him
since 12 men came to Cuba
and took to the Sierra to start the fight
At the palace
Fidel is reported to have said
He hopes the people of Cuba
will keep an affection for the palace...
Tickets ready, please. Tickets!
Fidel! Fidel!
