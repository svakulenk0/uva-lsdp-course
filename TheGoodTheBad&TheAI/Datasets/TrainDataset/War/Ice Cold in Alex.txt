Hello, Paul.
Everything OK?
Only just. It's bloody down there,
dropping heavy stuff all the time.
We got the wounded off, though.
Have a drink?
Lay off that stuff.
What the hell was that?
Ammo dump -
must be touching off our own stuff.
Any minute now, it'll be
"Naafi and Paymasters first"
Any news? The men keep asking damn
fool questions - what'll I say?
Nobody knows what's happening.
Just tell them
everything'll be all right.
In another siege it'll be all right
for the lucky ones who get sent out.
If there's a siege,
you'll be among them.
You'll be on the town with Ariadne
while I'm on my arse, being bombed.
I doubt it - experience in the Army
is always a factor.
I went through the last one.
I'm ideal to go through the next.
I'll damn well see you don't.
I wonder what Ariadne's doing now?
Tucked up warm and snug in bed
in Alexandria, I suppose.
Message from Corps HQ, sir.
Thank you, Corporal.
Evening, sir.
Evening, Anson.
Women get off all right?
I never wanted nurses but the Army
insisted - thought a woman's touch...
.. made the poor devils feel
they're on the road home.
Sit down - here's the picture.
The line's breached, but they're
the wrong side of the minefield.
We've taken a bashing so we're
re-forming to the east, to try again.
Meanwhile, there's a chance their
armour may breach our perimeter.
Another siege, sir?
The niceties of military terms
The point is, we're
not leaving any unnecessary stuff.
Your unit, less 25 ambulances, will
leave at 0100 hours, back to Salum.
The 25 ambulances,
commanded by a subaltern,...
.. will be under orders
of the colonel at the hospital here.
There's a thing - never a moment's
peace, never a moment's peace
Take a man going to the latrine...
- perfectly natural thing to do -
then this happens.
No wonder they get constipated!
I'd like a drink - how about you?
Thank you, sir.
These men who are staying behind
- how are you going to detail them?
Unmarried men, sir - put names
in a hat and pull out what I need.
Of course, I'll stay myself.
Nonsense. Your job's with the bulk
of the unit, not little detachments.
How about the big chap,
what's his name, Crosbie?
I'd rather leave a subaltern, sir.
Crosbie went through the last siege.
Then he'll know what it's all about,
and he hasn't a nerve in his body.
Yes, sir, but I...
That's settled, then.
Yes, sir. I'll leave with the bulk
of the unit at 0100 hours.
No, pick me up at first light
and drop me at Corps HQ.
My car was blown up this morning
outside my own blasted front door.
Look, sir, I wonder if...
.. would you mind
telling Crosbie yourself?
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Capt Anson's just come back, sir.
Close that ruddy blackout! >
Sorry, sir.
If you'd inspected properly,...
.. it wouldn't need a warrant officer
under here to show you how to do it.
Now finish off.
Fresh oil in the sump.
If you don't report falling oil
pressure again you're for it, m'lad.
Switch out the light.
Paul?
Look... I... I tried to fix it, but
the Brig just wouldn't wear it.
You fixed it all right
Sgt Major
- sit down, have a drink.
Thank you, sir.
You're sure these ambulances we're
leaving behind are the best, eh?
Yes, sir. There was a call
for one to go to the docks.
So I sent one
that was being left behind.
I'm sorry,...
.. I'm pretty well pooped out.
You've had just about enough, sir.
Of that?
Of everything, sir. Look - everyone
knows what they've got to do.
Why don't you get some sleep, sir?
Crosbie.
I'll talk to Capt Crosbie, sir.
Well, don't forget
to put that in the Humber.
It can go with your precious tools
in the back.
Sir?
Yes, you're coming out, too.
I'd rather stay behind, sir.
You... are coming... out.
You lie down, sir, just for an hour.
I'll call you when
the main column's ready to move off.
Come on, sir, come on.
Mr Pugh, you forgot that box of mine
- fetch it!
Right, sir.
Goodbye, Sgt Major - I see you've
everything laid on for this party.
We'll see you again soon, sir.
I doubt it.
Well, so long, Paul.
Remember me to Ariadne
when you get to Alex.
Let's go, Sgt Major.
You right bastard!
What are you doing here, Corporal?
Guarding the ladies, sir.
Ladies?
Two got left behind last night
when the nurses was evacuated.
Morning, ma'am.
Morning. We're a bit of a problem!
Why?
I'd never been in any bombing,
lost my nerve and ran, they sailed without us.
Our kit's on board.
That's the least of our worries.
Hurry up. That stuff should be
loaded by now. Morning, Mr Pugh.
Morning, sir.
Sister Murdoch, Sister Norton. Capt Anson'll get you
to Egypt and fix transport to Alex.
Your trouble!
We'll try not to be any trouble.
Right. Sgt Major, you drive the
ambulance and follow us to Corps HQ.
Right, sir.
Get over, man, get over.
Keep on the side. Over, man.
Get over, into the side. Over.
Corps HQ - or would be if
it hadn't gone. Won't be a moment.
Anson, I'm in a hurry
- can't trundle along with you.
Yes, sir, but...
You can drive, can't you, Ponsonby?
Yes, sir.
Come on, I'm uncomfortable
being too far behind Corps.
Our kit, sir - can we off-load it?
God, man, I'm only borrowing the car
- you'll get it back tonight.
Don't just sit there, Ponsonby,
get going. Come on, man, GET GOING!
Old Dangletoes is standing up.
waving his ruddy cap at 'em!
I bet he's giving them hell
in that foul German of his.
My tool kit!
My whisky.
It's all right, Denise.
I can't stand it!
Lie down on the floor
and pack the blankets round you.
All right.
Let's go, Tom.
Sorry, old boy,
I'm blowing that bridge.
Don't be a bloody fool. I must get
through, there's two nurses here.
Orders from Corps to get 'em back.
You can have the Angel Gabriel
inside - it's blowing, so get back.
Get going, Tom.
I shouldn't if I were you.
You've got 15 seconds - LET'S GO!
Back off sideways or you'll
catch the blast on the windscreen.
Lie down - there'll be a bang. >
Take it easy.
You'd better get weaving
- you've had it. Good luck.
Thanks. Okay, Tom, I'll drive.
Right, sir.
That was the bridge
over the tank trap being blown up.
What do we do now?
Only two things we can do.
Get back to the hospital. There's going to be a siege,
or try crossing the minefield.
We'll take you back to the hospital.
What will you do then?
Have a crack at the minefield.
LET ME OUT OF HERE, LET ME OUT!
We'll come with you.
Dames and mines - lovely party.
See if she needs help.
Right, sir.
Let me out, let me out...
Let me out, let me out!
Sorry. I've got brandy in my bag.
Want some?
Want some?
After you, miss.
What about Capt Anson?
No, miss.
Why not?
Better not. Well, I've been up and
down the desert with him five times.
He's never spared himself,
or us, for that matter.
There's plenty alive in hospitals
today who owe their lives to him.
Then he was captured.
Oh, he escaped all right, but
he'd a hell of a time getting back.
Two nights walking,
lying up in the day, no water.
He should have had a break -
he's driven himself to a standstill.
And he's trying to lace himself up
with drink?
That's about it.
Maybe he just likes the taste.
Don't worry, I won't give him any. I
won't even let him know I've got it.
How are things in the back?
Sister Murdoch's given her
an injection and she's out cold.
We need eight cans to be safe.
Let's start.
Right, sir. >
Hey!
Hey, Captain!
Can I grab a lift
and get the hell out of here?
Where do you want to go?
The delta - back to my own unit.
I've been lent to Signals,
but I can't do them any good now.
Man, I don't intend to get put in
the bag when the balloon goes up.
You can't go by road
- they've blown the tank bridge.
Where are you going?
To have a bash
at crossing the minefield.
I'd like to come with you, man.
Sorry, can't be done. Got a pair of
nurses in the back to get to Alex.
Besides, you'd be extra weight, a lot of extra weight,
and we're short on rations and water.
I can pay my way.
I've got a thousand cigarettes...
.. and three bottles of gin.
Export or Naafi?
The best, man, from South Africa.
Well,... ah, I daresay we could,
er, do with another hand to push.
Okay, I'll take you. I'm Anson.
Van der Poel.
Can I see your identity card?
Sure.
Thanks.
My Sergeant Major, Mr Pugh
- Captain van der Pole.
"van der Pooel".
Good morning, sir.
The captain's coming to push.
Yes, sir, another four jerry cans
and that's the lot, sir.
Start loading when you're ready.
Right, sir.
Hot, isn't it?
Yes. Like a drink?
Why not? Got a couple of mugs
in the cab.
What's happening?
A South African officer's coming with us,
and he's feeding the captain gin.
What's this, a party?
No, just one for the road.
The first road is through a minefield
- is that the usual training?
You know, the lady's right.
Let's get cracking, shall we?
Would you mind getting inside?
What's the matter with her? >
She got into a panic
and we had to give her some dope.
That's the lot, sir.
Right.
Here you are, man, catch!
And again!
And again!
And again!
Hey! Hup!
Hup!
And hup!
Hey, man!
What's our chance
of getting through the minefield?
Evens. I knew the tracks two years
ago - they may have re-mined it.
Well, once we get through...
Well, once we get through...
If we get through!
If we get through
- what if we run into any Germans?
They can't cover the whole perimeter
- there must be gaps.
We may have to talk our way out.
Anyone speak German?
No.
I do, I worked with them
in SW Africa. How about the girls?
No idea. Let's get through the
ruddy minefield first, shall we?
There's not much danger
if we stick to the tracks.
The tracks are faint.
I'll walk the whole way in sections.
You follow with the ambulance, Sgt Major,
ten yards behind, and watch the turns.
Right, sir.
It'll take hours, man.
Right, it'll take hours.
If I take the other track
it will halve the time.
Yes... I can't ask you to do that.
You're heavier than I am, for one.
A Springbok can go where
any bloody Englishman can.
Right. Watch where the tyre marks
are interrupted.
If you're not sure, shout. If you do feel something,
stay put the mines are live.
Sure, sure, Captain.
You take that one.
We're going in, now.
Come on, man,
we want to get through before dark.
We want to get through, don't we?
We're still in the minefield
- get back, miss.
I can't see anything
through those windows in the back.
That's the trouble, you can't,
unless something happens!
Which is it?
This way, of course. Straight on.
I don't agree.
I think that's the real one there.
Well, I'm going to try this way.
Stay there! I don't give a damn
if you blow yourself up. I'm trying my way first.
There's something under my foot.
Lift your foot up, gently.
Sorry, no beans in it - souvenir.
You've a funny sense of humour,
Captain.
That should take him down a peg.
Serve him right, too.
Are all South Africans like that?
He's Afrikaans
- Dutch - haven't met many myself.
Capt Anson was with them for a time.
He says they're a decent enough lot.
We're nearly through.
You'd better get back.
Bombers!
Heading this way. >
Don't worry, we're not the target.
They're after the minefield.
Man, I don't believe
there's a ruddy mine for miles.
Don't you?
Captain? I think I owe you a drink.
Thanks.
All right, Tom, don't stand there
with your tongue hanging out.
They blasted a way through for their
armour - let's... get cracking, eh?
God!
For God's sake, sir,
you'll break the springs!
Shut up!
If you don't stop they'll open fire.
Stop, here!
Get off!
Stop, stop, she's been hit!
Stop, you fool, stop.
Get out of it!
What the hell are you doing?
Hide our guns - they're funny
about arms on ambulances.
Let me handle this.
Neither of you speak a word...
.. except to me.
Sei vorsichtig!
Sorry, Tom, I made a bog of it.
Pop inside and see what's happened.
Give me the gin. If we're going inside I'll drink the ruddy lot
before they get here. Give it to me.
How is she?
She'll be dead within an hour.
Are you sure?
Is there anything we can do?
Nothing anyone can do. I know.
Who... kicked... me?
What's going on outside?
They've got us in the bag.
Capt van der Poel's talking to them.
What will they do, send us back?
No, not now we know they're here.
There's just a chance, though,
they may let us go on,...
.. rather than take us in
with escorts and all that.
Look, if you're so sure she's er...
.. might be better not to tell Jerry.
They're more likely to let us go on
with someone wounded than...
Tom, they're coming back.
" Durchsuche sie I
He wants to search the ambulance.
The captain says
he bitterly regrets this accident.
If we'd stopped as we ought to
he would never have opened fire.
Wie geht es ihr?
Wie geht es ihr?
He wants to know how she is.
Abdominal wound. It's not serious.
But we ought to get her to hospital.
Kleine Magenwunde, die aber im
Krankenhaus behandelt werden muss.
Sagen Sie der Krankenschwester,
dass ich den Wagen durchsuchen will.
He's going to search.
Ich werde gleich
Ihre Geschichte pruefen.
Natuerlich. Tun Sie das.
What is it?
I have to get some more dressings
- will you stay with her?
Is there anything I should do?
No. No, just be near.
Captain van der Poel, will you ask if
they have any spare large dressings?
I've used all ours.
Sure.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
How is she?
She'll be all right.
Not... d... duh... dut...
Here you are. They're sorry
they can't spare any more.
Thanks.
Man, I think we've pulled it off.
She talked quite a bit,
tried to get up to say something.
She's dead, Tom.
Also, sag' es ihnen.
She's sleeping.
He could put us in the bag...
.. but as the nurse is wounded
he's going to let us go through.
Sprechen Sie Englisch?
Nein.
I'm afraid the girl's gone.
If he knows that he'll tell them
and that'll be our lot
Why have they got Capt Anson?
So we follow them
till we're clear of their troops.
Then they give us the captain back
and turn us loose.
Cigarette?
No thanks.
Tom?
Tom?
Please. Light me one, will you?
Thank you.
Capt van der Poel,
can I ask you something?
Mmmm?
About Capt Anson.
He's had rather a bad time recently.
Been drinking heavily.
Probably screaming for one, now,
but we rely on him for navigation.
Please don't give him any.
Phah! What do I do if he asks?
He won't. Just help him.
Keep it out of sight.
I'll just go off by myself.
Bleib hier mit Kapitaen Anson.
Jawohl, Herr Hauptmann. "
Kommen Sie mit mir, bitte.
He wants to know how she is.
Still asleep.
Sie schlaeft noch.
Geh so weg.
Hals- und Beinbruch!
What did he say?
Good luck.
Sure it's all right?
Yes.
If I know Driver Grimes, he'll have enough tea
tucked away to start a cafe.
Aha - half full.
Can I do anything, man?
Thank you, sir, if you start
the fire, I'll open the rations.
That's for the water, sir.
Here you are, sir.
The spade for the sand.
Sand?
Sorry, I thought all South African
troops brewed up the same as us.
Don't worry, sir, I'll do it.
Would you get water and petrol?
Time to wake the captain.
Well, take it, it's hot.
Captain Anson, Captain Anson.
What's happened?
Why have we stopped?
Nothing's happened.
We've done the twenty-one miles.
Thanks.
An awful wind's started,
blowing sand all over the place.
It usually does when you brew up.
We didn't want to tell you
till you'd had some rest.
I can't write this one off.
You couldn't help it.
No?
I'm a drunk, you know that?
You were trying to get us away.
No excuses - I don't want them.
I'll tell you this...
- the next drink I have
is going to be a lager,...
.. ice cold.
There's a little bar in Alex,...
.. with a marble-topped counter
and high stools,...
.. and they serve the best beer
in all the Middle East.
When we get through with this lot,
I'll buy you one.
I'll buy you all one.
Come and have some food.
It'll be dark soon, Tom.
We'd better get on with it.
We'll build a cairn up there as a
marker and bury her in the morning.
I'll wake van der Poel
and get him to lay on the grub.
Right, sir.
If it's not too much trouble,
get your can off there and brew up I
Hello.
Hello.
How's it going?
Ach, man, you wait. I'm a good cook.
We'll let you know later.
Did I, er, tell you I was attached
to your division for a bit?
Were you? When?
Er, let's see, about last September.
I wasn't there, then.
I only came up six months ago.
I expect some of the blokes
on supplies are the same,...
.. and, of course, old Dan Pinnear.
Jan Pinnaar - he's a character.
He's so Afrikaans, I'm surprised
you could understand his English.
We managed.
Then there was... er, the colonel...
.. in supplies... Colonel... er...
.. Kramer?
Kramer?
No, surely he was ordnance.
It was Colonel Maggs with supplies.
Yes, of course, Maggs.
Smells good.
Thanks to Mr Grimes, the biggest
scrounging so-and-so in the unit.
Everything but the kitchen stove...
- spuds, onions, steak and kidney
pud... all gone in with the bully.
Man, that was good.
Now, we'll have to have a watch.
Let's see, there are three of us.
Four.
All right.
You two take first shift till 12:30
and you and I'll take over till dawn
That'll give us four hours each.
We should be up at six and hit the
track near Piccadilly by sundown.
It's a cakewalk to Sidi Barrani.
Why not wait for daybreak,
see who's in Sidi?
You mean Jerry? Hell, man,
Barrani's halfway to Alex.
Well, it's your party.
Where's he going?
You, er... tell her, Tom.
In the desert, you never ask anyone
where they're going with a spade.
That's common to both sides.
What's he taking
that ruddy great pack for?
There's something phoney about him.
When we stopped at midday, he
hadn't a clue how to start a fire.
He's probably always
had somebody to do it for him.
He must have seen it done
- you'd think he'd...
Let's get some rest
- douse the fire, will you?
Night, Tom.
G'night.
Don't think me stupid
- I can't bear to see her covered up on a night like this.
I didn't know her very well, really.
She was rather a silly little thing,
awful flirt,...
.. not even a very good nurse.
I feel worse about this
than anything that's ever happened.
You feel bad about it?
How the hell do you think I feel?
It's done, man,
no use accusing yourself.
Start playing around with war,
these things happen.
What do you keep in that pack?
Gin.
Want some?
Time to wake up, Tom.
Capt van der Pole?
Van der Pooel!
What is it?
Blasted pump! Thought it was
leaking, so I put the tin there.
It's half full already.
The washer's crumbling - if I try
tightening it up it may break up.
What happens then?
No washer, no pump, no engine,
nothing.
Rock. We'll have to start again
somewhere else.
Solid rock, sir? >
No, it's a layer. Pretty thick one.
Here, give me that thing.
I'll carry on, now
- the rest'll be easy.
You haven't got an indelible pencil
or anything like that, have you?
No.
I've got a pen, sir.
What about my lipstick?
It's meant to be waterproof.
It'll do fine.
"The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want. "
"He maketh me lie down
in green pastures. "
"He leadeth me
beside the still waters. "
"Yea,...
.. though I walk through
the shadow of the valley of death...
.. I shall... I will fear no evil. "
"Thou preparest a table for me...
.. in the presence of my enemies. "
Vortreten!
Nur einer vortreten!
He wants only one of us.
Vorwaerts, schnell!
Schnell, komm schnell.
Halt. Nehme die Waffen ab.
We won't get away with it this time.
Lass mal sehen!
Ihr beide, mitkommen.
Nehmt ihnen die Waffen weg!
We must give up our guns.
I told you, they're funny
about armed troops on ambulances.
Komm!
I've got some bad news
- Tobruk's fallen.
I don't believe it.
He doesn't believe us, and
it's up to him what happens next.
He can't call his HQ for orders
- they've got wireless silence.
Schreiben Sie das auf.
Gehen! Wir bringen keine Frauen
auf das Schlachtfeld.
Sie sollten das auch nicht.
He says to go, that they
don't bring women into battle...
.. and we shouldn't either.
He says to go further south.
They're through to Maddalena, and
will cut off Mersa Matruh in days.
I don't believe a ruddy word.
He says we must start straight away.
All right, let's get going.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Well, you got us out of another jam.
I don't know how - he was a bastard.
With Tobruk gone,
they've more to do than round us up.
I don't believe Tobruk's gone.
Anyway, it looked as if
you were telling him what to do.
It's the only way with bloody Nazis.
Kick 'em in the guts
before they kick you.
Tom, in case that young Jerry
was right,...
.. we should go for the Garawla track
That'll take three days, sir
- what about the pump?
What's the water situation?
About 14 gallons, sir.
The pump'll use nine or ten.
That doesn't leave much for us.
Bir Beyli's 15 miles south, sir. We
can find water for the pump there.
I hadn't thought of that
- let's see the map.
There she is - Bir Beyli.
Well, we've dug it out before.
I suppose we can do it again.
How far down's the water?
Five, ten, fifteen feet.
We dig to find out.
Tom, we'll go down in one corner
and see if it gets damp.
Here, take a mouthful.
Rinse it round and spit it out.
Don't swallow,
it'll make you thirstier than ever.
Scarcely damp and as salty as hell.
We ought to talk this thing over.
Look, we can go on trying
to dig this ruddy thing out...
- heaven knows how long it'll take,
and we may not find water.
We'll be using up what we've got.
We have three alternatives - look.
First, we can cut straight up
to Mersa Matruh.
If Jerry's right,
they're going to be there first
Or we can take the longer but safer
camel route round the Depression,...
.. and then cut up the Garawla track.
It's 270 miles, almost three days,
and we may be damned short of water.
What's the third alternative?
Well, the third alternative
is straight down to the Qara oasis.
There's a dump the desert group uses
We fill up with water and petrol
and cut through the Depression.
The Depression, sir?
I haven't made an improper
suggestion! We've done it before.
I know, sir, but that was training.
We'd light stuff
- and aircraft to look after us.
In this crate, we'd never do it.
Remember that jeep,
went down like a submarine?
Of course I remember.
What is the Depression?
A salt marsh below sea level.
About 200 miles long, hot,
and Katy'd boil all the way.
Liquid, with a dried crust on top
rather like a mouldy rice pudding.
There is a track of sorts...
.. but as Tom says,
if you do go through, well,...
.. you've pretty well bought it.
Katy does weigh two tons, remember.
So what?
Well, there are the alternatives.
What's it to be?
The Garawla Track, sir.
I'll keep the pump going.
I agree with him. The Depression
isn't an alternative.
Okay, the Garawla Track it is.
Bones.
Ran out of water, I suppose.
STOP, SIR, A SPRING'S GONE!
Pull up, man.
Be sure and make them
absolutely firm, sir.
They'll have to take all the weight
when I pull the jack out.
Why mess about with stones?
Can't we just hold it on the jack?
No, sir, we should have two jacks.
We've only got one - do it this way
to ease the new spring in position.
Right, stand clear, sir,
I'm going to let her down.
Look out!
Hold her for a moment! Just one
second, sir! Go on, hold her, sir!
Hold her, sir.
Hold her!
That's the most wonderful
bloody effort you'll ever see.
He must have taken all of a ton
on his back.
Get me the water bottle.
Right.
If he hadn't held her
she'd have smashed her back axle.
We'd have just kept on walking
till our water ran out.
Here.
Let's get him into the shade.
I'll get a stretcher.
No, don't need a stretcher. Give
me a pull up. I'll be all right.
Take it easy,... easy.
Look out - Aircraft!
It's all right, it's one of ours.
"Jerry's advanced
beyond Sidi Barrani. "
"Our troops falling back
to Alamein. "
"Do not, repeat, not
attempt coast west of Darba. "
Darba? I can't believe it.
It's only 100 miles from Alex.
That means Jerry's ahead.
That means Jerry's ahead.
What now?
Unless you want to spend the war in
a prison camp, as I said earlier...
- south to the Qara oasis
and the Depression. Any objections?
Good, carried unanimously.
And tomorrow, when we're
bogged down to the axles,...
.. the water's gone, and we're alone
in 1,000 sq miles of mud,...
.. you can all spit in my eye.
All right, Tom, let's get going
- we don't want to be here all day.
Would you like to go in the back?
No, no thanks. I... I feel better
now, but I'd like a drink, though.
Huh! A real drink.
I'll get it.
NO! I'LL DO IT!
Thanks very much.
You like some? No?
Hah!
Bang on time.
Very regular habits.
This afternoon,
when I got van der Poel his pack...
.. it was heavy, too heavy
for a few bottles of gin.
When I tried to open it for him,
he wouldn't let me.
Listen, you've both from time to
time complained about van der Poel.
Here's a chance to get it
off your chest... well, Tom?
He's phoney, sir, hasn't a clue
how to make the fire,...
.. yet S African troops
brew up as we do.
And, why... why does he always go
to the latrine at the same time?
Perhaps he's well brought up.
Diana?
I agree with Tom. I never liked
the man, but it's more than that.
There is something phoney.
Where are you going?
Just for a walk, sir.
Well?
I saw something, for a second
- the light was bad -...
.. but it was like a wireless mast.
Are you sure of that?
No, I'm not sure, but, well,
he certainly didn't use the spade.
Maybe he changed his mind.
Maybe you're right and he is a spy.
What do we do? Knock him over the
head and leave him with his gin?
If he has a wireless, we must stop
him transmitting to the Germans.
What information has he got?
Why risk using it every night?
To keep in touch with his HQ.
He may need to get through quickly,
assuming he is a spy and he has a transmitter.
Remember, he saved us once,
and we may need him again.
Let's leave it for the moment.
Could do with a shave,
couldn't you, Tom?
Yes, sir.
We'll push on a bit further before
it's dark - your turn in the back.
Okay.
We'll find out at Qara
- meanwhile, forget it. >
Okay, Tom, I'll see about the tin. >
We're stopping here for the night.
Are the British at Qara oasis?
We won't get there
till tomorrow afternoon.
By that time we're just as likely
to find Jerry there.
Yeah, at the rate they're going,
anything could happen.
There you are - Qara oasis.
Now we can get water and petrol.
Doesn't seem to be anybody about,
sir.
I'll scout around a bit, Tom.
You watch the ambulance.
Right, sir.
Moya, moya.
Khamsa. Khamsa moya.
OOLA E GEHEENA!
English, okay,... English.
A teesh em taheena. Ra ha feen?
We come from Tobruk - go, er... go
Alexandria. We want water, petrol.
Ha de mush tareek. >
Listen, we want water, petrol.
See, money. How much you want?
Ma tesh tun nesh!
The clot doesn't understand English.
The clot doesn't understand English.
Sorry, had to make sure.
This clot had difficulty
with your Arabic!
Good God! Who are you?
Just stooging around, old boy.
May I see your papers, please?
You belong to the garrison?
They went this morning.
The Germans are coming - I'm here to
help them by sugaring the petrol!
For Pete's sake let's have some
before you do it.
How will you get away?
The Germans'll be here in 3 hrs
and they're ahead along the coast.
Across the Depression.
- In that crate?
- Uh-huh.
I suppose it is your only chance!
Want a lift?
Unfortunately I've an engagement.
Let's see to that petrol.
Pity it's late. You won't get far tonight
I shouldn't drive in the dark.
Ladies and gents, the camel road...
.. which everyone since Alexander
the Great has taken to Alex.
You'll have to stop, sir,
she's boiling.
Quick!
Give me a hand, sir.
Go on, give him some more.
What the hell? He's a brave man.
Not again, man
- this is the sixth time.
It's not the radiator.
The light's going.
Surely you can do
another couple of miles?
I won't risk it in the dark.
Sorry I folded up on you.
There you are, sir.
Thanks, Tom.
Feel better now?
Apart from a splitting headache
and a mouth like a parrot cage, I'm fine, thanks.
Wish we'd gone a bit further - it's
the lowest part of the whole issue.
I dunno - looks pretty firm to me.
Well, it isn't
- we're on top of a ruddy jelly.
We'll be lucky she doesn't bog down
in the night.
She's on sand mats, sir, in case.
Listen, nobody move a foot
off the tracks - understand?
Okay.
Douse the fire.
What are you going to do?
If he's a spy, he'll signal tonight
about our chaps at the oasis.
We'll try and catch our South
African friend with his pants down.
He can't be far along the track.
Uncover the lamps.
Get in the cab, Tom, and when
I give the signal, switch on.
Now I.
Over to the left, Tom.
Turn out the lights.
Switch on.
Over to the right.
Go back, Tom.
Hard down right.
Hard over left.
Now forward.
Stop - hard down right.
Hard over left.
Stop.
Hard down right.
Now forward.
I'm trapped!
Tom, quick, he's in trouble,
get the sand mats.
Another mat, quick.
Get the tow rope.
Give me something else
- a shirt, anything.
Hold on, hold on.
Throw it, man.
Throw it, hurry,
I'm being sucked under.
Grab hold, grab hold.
Pull. Pull.
Hang on, man.
Pull!
Aaargh!
Hurry!
Get the ambulance.
I'm gone. I can't stop.
For God's sake...
Diana?
Get in!
Get in!
I can't drive.
When I signal,
let the clutch out gently.
You go round the other side.
That's enough.
Get water, gin.
There's some in his other pack.
Give him a drink.
He's unconscious,
but he'll be all right.
You saw what was in his pack?
He is a Nazi.
Diana, get in the ambulance. We'll
bring him round, you clean him up.
Use petrol, we can't spare water.
How is he?
Exhausted. I gave him a sedative.
This didn't do the track much good.
Let's get out of here quickly.
We'll soon need another halt, sir,
or she'll boil again.
Tom, can't we get on?
She must be cool by now. >
We'll have to leave her
a bit longer, sir. >
I... I want to say something
about last night.
I want to apologise.
I should've done like you told me,
stuck to the track.
Skip it.
Afraid you lost your shirt, though.
And your pack.
Why did you do it?
Do what?
Turn on the headlamps.
Heard a noise,
thought you might have gone in.
Weren't far wrong, were we?
No,...
.. no, you weren't.
Thanks.
You'll be able to dine out on this
story for weeks, won't he, Tom?
Certainly will, sir.
I'll go and top her up now, sir.
How much further
till we get out of this?
Oh, about another 80 miles.
Shall we get out tonight?
No, we're through the worst, though.
Well, let's get started, shall we?
What are you going to do about him?
Nothing, yet.
He thinks he's safe with us.
We'll let him go on thinking that,
for the moment.
Man, this heat.
Yeah.
Doesn't seem to bother old Tom much,
does it?
Well,...
.. this time tomorrow...
...our little party
will have broken up.
What's the first thing you'll do
when you get to Alex?
Told you - that beer.
It's so ruddy cold there's a sort
of dew on the outside of the glass.
And then?
Then I'll pull the chain six times
just for the sound of running water.
Someone waiting for you?
Well, it's...
.. it's all rather complicated.
Tell me.
Paul Crosbie,
a character in my unit,...
.. we took our leaves together,...
.. and in Alex last time...
.. we got caught up with somebody.
What's her name?
Ariadne.
And you're both in love with her?
That seemed to be the idea.
Where is he now?
Paul? In the bag, I'm afraid.
One of us had to stay behind
in Tobruk.
I'd no choice
- he thought I was ratting on him.
Now you think
you might have an unfair advantage?
What do you think?
I think you don't understand women.
I don't.
She'll know what she wants.
If it's Paul, nothing you do
will make the slightest difference.
And if it's you,
I think you should know by now.
Like a judge's summing up
- sound, logical, cold as hell...
.. and probably right.
Do you always know what you want?
Always.
We'll be on top in a few minutes.
The track up is just over there.
What's the matter?
This slope -
the wind's blown sand all over it.
We'll have trouble getting her up.
If we don't do it, we'll be
stuck like ants in a jam pot.
Isn't there any other way?
'Fraid not.
Let's try to belt her up it, Tom.
Right, sir.
I'll signal. Come on, you two.
Okay,...
.. she should be going well by here.
We can give her a shove if needed.
Man, she hasn't a chance
on this sand. She'll bog down.
Not if we do what I say. TOM? TOM?
There, what did I tell you?
Like a ruddy dose of salts.
Hold her!
What did you expect, man,
on this slope! >
It's madness - we'll never get up.
We'll take her up on the mats,
You've got the spade.
We've only got one. Use your hands.
You know what's going to happen?
We're going to stick halfway
and won't get her up or down.
Get out I Out of it I
Don't stand there like a Hyde Park
floosie - round the back and push!
You stop grinning about your
love life - come and help.
Get cracking, Tom!
Come on!
Shove, damn you - don't
lean against the bloody thing.
Never mind your ruddy make-up.
Get up - push!
It's no good, sir.
No good? You're a fine one
to talk, riding all the way.
You told me to drive, sir. The
engine's boiling over, it's heating.
A seized engine won't get us to Alex
So you all want to walk, do you?
All right, there's the compass.
Take food and water,...
.. keep on 30 degrees for two days
- and I hope it keeps fine for you.
Who the hell are you talking to?
I've taken enough.
You haven't taken half
you're going to, yet.
Hold it - take it easy, gentlemen.
I'm going to get Katy to Alex,
do you understand? I'm going to.
It's a personal thing.
Let him alone.
There is a way we might get her up.
Wind her up on the starting handle
with the plugs out,...
.. in reverse, lowest gear.
It's a long shot but it could work.
In the reverse means you've got to
turn her round - she'll fall over.
Not if we use our weight
- I'll show you.
Down on the left. Take her down
on the left - she'll go this time.
Go on, round with her.
That's it, away you go. Hard round,
all she'll go, go on, round you go.
Full lock, full lock, man.
I've no idea what they're doing.
They tried to explain to me but
I'm hopeless at that sort of thing.
If you take the plugs out
there's no resistance.
If you put her in low gear
and wind the starting handle,...
.. the wheels turn very slowly.
Because the movement's gradual,
the sand isn't disturbed...
that's the theory.
Come and help.
All right,
I'll come and watch a miracle.
Now, let's see.
Brake off?
Okay.
Any movement?
No.
Nothing at all?
It's working!
Tom! It's working!
It's working!
Right - 500 turns each till we
get to the top. Right - here we go!
Only another thirty feet, sir.
Hold her there. I'll get my shirt.
Come on - we're there!
She's away!
Stop it! Stop it!
Oh, dear God.
My fault - I should
have had somebody on the brake.
That's your job next trip.
Well, let's take a little exercise,
shall we?
Come on, now. It's quite simple.
When we say "brake" just pull hard on the brake
and the ratchet'll hold her. Right? Good.
All right - Brake off!
We're there. We made it.
See that clear bit?
That's the reflection of the sea.
Right, van der Poel - it's your honour to bring her up
the last lap. Get cracking. Bar opens at six.
# My old man said
follow the van
# Don't dilly-dally on the way
# Off went the van
with my home in it
# I followed on
with me old cock linnet
# But I dillied and dallied,
dallied and dillied
# Lost the way
and don't know where to roam
# Cos you can't trust the Specials
like the old-time coppers
# When you can't find
your way home. #
Do you want to see him
stuck up against a wall and shot?
No, I don't.
Well, he is a spy.
Is your officer here, Sergeant?
In the tent, sir.
Identity card, Diana. Paybook, Tom.
Right, sir.
Nip in the back
and keep him company, will you?
Tom, shouldn't we put the tin
under the radiator?
That tin! Never again. You don't
know how I feel about that tin!
Captain Johnson - Sister Murdoch.
Pretty good show, Sister.
I expect you'd like
a wash and brush-up.
Thanks, we've got to push on.
- A drink?
- No, we've a date for that.
Okay. Hope the shirt fits
your chum - biggest I could find.
Thanks - I'll see you get it back.
Thanks.
Present from the military police
to Captain van der Poel.
Better take the pips off
before you give it to him.
I suppose you know
what you're doing?
This time, yes.
What about us?
We'll both go back to our units,
like I told you.
I'd like to be coming with you.
Too much of a handful.
You'll be coming back to Alex?
No, wouldn't work out.
I'd like to think it could,...
...but... it wouldn't.
Only make you unhappy.
See?
Started already!
You said you don't understand women.
You certainly don't understand me.
If you did, you'd realise
I don't give up so easily.
Better take the er... shirt
in to the captain.
What's that?
The other spring's gone.
Shall I pull up, sir?
What the hell! She's done 600 miles
- we've only four to go - bash on.
You good old cow!
Set 'em up, Joe.
Set what up?
Four ice-cold lagers.
Captain Anson. Where have you been?
Doing some merging. Come on, Joe,
let's have that beer, hmm?
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
You kept your promise.
Well, let's hope the beer's
what I said it was, eh?
Worth waiting for.
Come on. Drink up. You deserved it.
Four more, Joe.
Here's to you, men!
Good luck!
Sit down, over here. Stall. Quick.
Move on. Sit down. Sit down.
Come on man, drink up.
You're one behind.
Cigarette?
- Captain Anson.
- You're early.
Maybe. It's strictly forbidden
to fraternize with the enemy.
Fresh off the boat. Thinks - is the answer.
You obey orders, lieutenant. Wait outside
until the time I fixed with your CO.
I've phoned for them at the checkpoint.
We've only got a few minutes.
Now, what's your real name?
Look. I told security you're a German officer.
You got locked outside Tobruk.
We picked you up and you gave us your parole.
But the whole thing breaks down
if we don't know your real name.
Don't try to bluff it out now, man.
We've known for a long time.
We knew the first time you tried
to get us through your own people.
Once was a miracle, but twice … just wasn't on.
And that bloody grey bag of yours.
We knew it was a transmitter long before
it went down in the bog.
Now, come on. What's your real name?
My God, man, can't you see it's your last chance?
Why do you think I got rid of everything that
identified you as a South African? Stick to my story!
You know the alternative?
Do you want to be stuck up against a wall and shot?
Otto Lutz.
Hauptmann engineer. 21st Panzer group.
Well, here's to you, Otto.
We all know damn well we wouldn't be here
if it hadn't been for you.
It's 6:30, Captain Anson.
OK. But won't you fraternize
with us and have one for the road?
No, thank you.
You'll release me from my parole,
Herr Capitan?
Certainly.
Now, look.
I told your CO that Hauptmann looks at
The Hague in an exemplary manner.
So there's no need for a ball and chain.
First, will you shake hands with me, please?
Otto.
You, um, haven't finished your beer.
It has been quite an experience.
All against the desert. The greater enemy.
I've learned a lot about the English.
So different from all I've been taught.
Auf Weidersehen.
