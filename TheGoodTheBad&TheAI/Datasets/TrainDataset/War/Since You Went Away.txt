Mother!
Mother!
- Mother, where are you?
- Upstairs, dear.
Hello, Mother.
Hi, darlings.
Are you awfully wet?
Jane, such a nice, fresh cheek.
Better get your
wet things off, Brig.
Did Pop get off all right?
Was his train on time?
It was mean of Pop not to let us
go to the station with you.
Darling, you know
how much he loves you.
He didn't even want  there.
You know how he hates a fuss.
And Louisiana's not so far.
And he'll be home on leave
before he go...
He looked so swell in his cap
and uniform, didn't he?
I'll bet the others were all jealous.
I'd hate a squinchy little father.
Pop looks like a parade
all by himself.
- Did he have my present with him?
- Right in his pocket, Brig.
I hope he keeps all his money
in it and everything.
I hope he buys
those generals a drink,
and maybe he'll be a major
by the time he gets home on leave.
He can be a major
anytime he wants to.
Anyhow, he'd probably rather do
something else with it anyway,
like sending Mother
a present or...
- Or what, honey?
- I don't know.
Buy some magazines
or books maybe.
I wasn't really thinking.
I have an idea.
How would you like to play
gin rummy before dinner?
- Okay?
- Okay.
Let's not.
It won't be the same without Pop.
Not even gin rummy...
nothing!
Hello, Soda.
Brig, are you never going to get
out of this bathroom?
Go fly a kite. I wish you'd wait
till I get through!
If you don't get through soon,
you'll brush the enamel off your teeth.
You all stop that bickering.
It's time you girls
was getting to bed.
- Hi, Fidelia.
- Hello, Fidelia.
- Where have you been all day?
- Where's your mother?
I'm in here,
in Jane's room.
All right, princess,
the mirror's all yours now.
You can have a wonderful time
looking at yourself.
Evening, Miz Hilton.
Did Captain Hilton
get away all right this afternoon?
Yes, Fidelia. He said he'd send you
a postcard from New Orleans.
What about you?
How did things go?
I got that job this afternoon
with some lofty people uptown.
The wages is mighty fine.
I starts right away.
But I ain't gonna be contentment.
I ain't gonna be contentment like
I been right here all these years.
I'm afraid we're not going to be
very contentment either, Fidelia.
What's more, I don't know what
kind of housekeeper I'm going to make.
I can tell you something.
You ain't gonna be very good.
I've been figuring out this budget.
I don't see how we're going to make it.
I've already arranged
to sell the car.
I don't think the government
pays them officers enough.
I don't see why Mr. Hilton
ain't worth as much to Uncle Sam
as he was to that
advertising company.
You'll probably have
a much easier time
than you've had
taking care of all of us.
You're not leaving us?
Did we do something
to make you mad?
Honey, you couldn't do nothing
to make me mad, no matter what.
You're just like my own child.
Did I hear something
about Fidelia leaving?
Now, Jane, I'm just as unhappy
about it as you are.
We can't keep up the payments
on the house
just by cutting down
on your allowances.
Golly.
First Pop, and now Fidelia.
That's enough of that, Brig.
I don't want no mourning.
You say good night
to your sister and run along to bed.
You, too, Jane.
Tomorrow's a school day.
The Lord Himself will have to take
care of these calamities somehow.
You'll come to see us,
won't you, Fidelia?
Of course I will, child.
If you don't pick up your clothes,
you never will keep a husband.
Men don't fancy disorderment.
- Good night for now, Jane, honey.
- Good night, Fidelia.
Whee! I'm a commando!
This is all that's left
of Fidelia's last cake,
and I'm afraid it's pretty stale,
but cake is cake these days.
I don't care what they do
as long as they don't ration pickles.
Yes, I know.
You'll have chronic indigestion
by the time the war's over.
Hi, Gladys.
What on earth's
the matter with that child?
Gladys is afraid
of grownups, that's all.
I'd like to hear her say two words
just to be sure she  talk.
Who you talking about... Gladys?
I don't see how Brig can put up with it.
I don't think much of your friends.
They're all man-crazy just like you are.
It's too early
in the morning to argue.
Hurry up. You'll be late.
You tell Becky Anderson
the next time she tries to high-hat me...
- Good morning, Mr. Mahoney.
- Good morning, girls.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mrs. Hilton.
I thought I'd bring the groceries and see
if there was anything I could do.
That is nice of you. I think
I'll need all the help I can get.
I hope you won't mind
waiting on last month's bill.
I haven't received
my first allotment check yet,
and I'm not
a very good manager.
I know, everybody's
got problems these days.
Now, you take me,
for instance.
I'm trying to get enough
of everything for my customers.
Would you believe it, Mrs. Hilton...
one of them had the nerve
to ask me why I didn't
go into the black market.
- Me, with my boy in the service.
- You don't mean Johnny?
I wondered why
I haven't seen him lately.
Yes, ma'am,
and he's a mighty fine boy.
I've got a picture of him
in his uniform right here.
I'd love to see him.
You're very proud of him,
aren't you?
Yes, ma'am.
There are two things that Johnny
always wanted to be.
One of them
was to be an aviator.
And what is Johnny's
other ambition, Mr. Mahoney?
Well, you wouldn't
be believin' this maybe,
but it's advertising.
Advertising.
My Johnny always wanted
to be an advertising man.
Well, I'm sure he'll be
very successful at it.
You really think that,
do you, ma'am?
Yes, I do.
You do?
Well, I guess I'd better
be running along.
- Good-bye, Mrs. Hilton.
- Good-bye.
Mr. Mahoney.
I think Mr. Hilton
might like to help Johnny
get into the advertising business
when the war's over.
Now, that is an idea.
It wouldn't have occurred to me.
Mr. Hilton  in the advertising
business, isn't he?
And I'm sure he'd be delighted.
We've always thought Johnny
was a fine, intelligent boy.
That he is, ma'am.
That and a whole lot more.
And you've really given us
something to look forward to...
me and Johnny and the missus.
It was very nice of you to come
and visit with me this way.
Not at all, ma'am.
Not at all.
- Mother.
- Yes?
Do you think that I could
be a good secretary?
Ha, a secretary.
Why don't you be a Wac?
You could be their mascot.
All right, go ahead and starve.
See if I care.
Dumb magazines.
Everybody's got magazines.
I know!
Why don't we take somebody
into the house... a roomer?
If you're going to throw away aces,
Jane, that's fine with me.
Mother, why shouldn't we
rent a room?
- There's such a terrible shortage.
- Go away.
Down with five.
It's perfectly ridiculous, Brig.
A stranger in our home.
Where you get your ideas
is beyond me.
Certainly it's ridiculous.
It's Communism... that's what it is.
Oh, pooh.
We could get an officer maybe.
And it might be
sort of like having Pop back.
An officer.
I think maybe she's right.
I understand there's not
a room to be had in town.
It might be very patriotic of us
to take an officer into our house.
Patriotism hasn't
anything to do with it.
You're just crazy
about uniforms.
We should do everything
we can for our soldiers.
Brig, Jane,
now that's enough.
Do you want to finish this game
or don't you?
- 102. It's a blitz.
- Turn out the dining room lights.
Suppose Pop were looking
for a room in some crowded city.
Hurry up, Jane. It can't be
that hard to figure out.
Suppose there was a family
like ours that had three bedrooms.
Don't you think it would be
malicious not to rent a room to Pop?
Well, Jane?
I won almost $6,000.
Deduct it from what you owe me.
And poor Pop
sleeping in the park!
All right, all right,
Pop is sleeping in the park
and the people are malicious
and we decide to rent him a room.
- Now you satisfied?
- You'll do it?
I didn't say I'd do it.
I'll think about it.
I knew you couldn't be mean like
those characters in that other city.
Come along.
I wonder how much
we can get for Jane's room.
My room?
How much will that be
for three days?
What?
Brig, turn that thing off.
I can't hear.
I'm awfully sorry.
Yes. Will this get
into the early edition?
Yes. Fireplace and bay window.
Oh, all right.
Put in "homey atmosphere."
Mother! Mother!
Wait, please!
Keep quiet, Brig. Would you send
the bill to this address, please?
Thank you.
You don't mean you're
going to rent  room?
That's the room
that will bring the most money.
I'll take your room, and you
can double up with Jane.
You're not going to put
somebody in Pop's room?
I didn't mean that.
You wouldn't want
those characters in that other city
to put Pop in anything
but their best room, would you?
But that's different.
He's Pop.
Good morning.
Is this the place
that advertised for an officer?
That's right.
With the real fireplace,
nice bay window, southern exposure?
That's right.
I haven't seen the room yet,
but the homey atmosphere seems okay.
I guess it's a deal.
I'm sorry, but the room's
already taken.
Oh, I see.
I'm sorry you had
the trip for nothing.
Yes, I can see
you're grief-stricken.
Hi, beaver.
Good morning.
Mrs. Hilton, I presume.
Yes.
May I be permitted to observe,
this is the first house I've found
in this godforsaken community
- that doesn't smell of cabbage.
- Well, it does sometimes.
I was given to understand
at the office of the Purchasing Division,
to which I have
the misfortune to be attached,
that you had a room for rent.
Yes, but I specified an officer.
You see, my husband...
My name is Smollett, William G.,
Colonel, United States Army, retired.
Retired, I might add, by virtue
of certain fatuous opinions
held in the War Department
which judge a man's usefulness
neither by his experience
nor his ability,
but by the number of years
since he was weaned.
Soda.
There was nothing
in the information I was furnished
which indicated that you
had children and domestic pets.
I'm sorry, but they
go with the house.
We won't discuss it.
With your permission, madam,
may we dispense
with further conversation?
I should like
to inspect the room.
Certainly. Just follow me.
I do hope you'll forgive me
if I've been long-winded.
Not at all, madam.
Through a full
and somewhat protracted existence,
I have learned to accept
the natural tendency
of all women to be garrulous.
You're very tolerant, Colonel.
This is an outrage!
Mrs. Hilton!
Can I do anything for you,
Colonel Smollett?
- Mother's busy in the kitchen.
- Indeed you can, Miss Hilton.
You can tell me
who had the kindness
to leave on my bed this
pronouncement from Washington,
this lesson in old-world
courtesy and manners.
I did that, Colonel Smollett.
I thought it might
make it easier for us to get along.
Would you mind helping me
with my aquarium?
What?
Mother's going to use this room.
I have to get my things into Jane's room.
Now, if you'll just
grab that end there...
Now you walk backwards
and I'll steer you.
The big one seems to be
the commanding officer.
- Don't you think that's intriguing?
- Fascinating.
It's a little over to the right.
Be careful not to shake them.
They're very sensitive.
You must forgive me
if I do anything wrong.
This is my first experience
hauling fish.
Thanks, Colonel.
I'll do as much for you someday.
I'll tell you what you
do for me, young woman.
There are certain elaborate
suggestions on page three
of this war communiqué
concerning the condition,
the schedule, and the equipment
of the bathroom.
- Oh, yes.
- You do see?
Then may I ask you
to follow me for a moment?
It was my idea
that we should take in a roomer,
and I'm so glad the whole thing's
turned out so super.
Since you are so ecstatic
over the whole arrangement,
may I ask you whether you
expect me to bathe under that?
Golly, there's a shower
off Pop's room... I mean your room.
And is it necessary
that your paying guest
share the facilities of the house
with this vegetable life?
You don't understand. This is
the philodendron Pop gave me.
It needs water. I don't think rain water
gives it enough nourishment.
Really? As soon as there's
no longer any danger
of pernicious anemia, would you
mind removing that topsoil?
Yes, and another thing.
I neglected to inform your mother
that I like my breakfast
promptly at 7:00...
coffee, thin toast, and two
eggs boiled, 21/2 minutes...
under no circumstances
more than three.
We can't afford
to give you breakfast.
As it is now, poor Mother
doesn't know what to do.
When Fidelia was here, the bills
didn't seem to be so high, but now...
Please.
I'm quite prepared to pay.
That's fine. What would you say
to 50 cents a day?
- That seems a bit high.
- We'll make it $3 a week.
There's the doorbell.
Let's call it a deal. Good night.
But...
Let me see...
...a week for rent...
...for breakfast.
Fidelia!
This is a nice surprise.
I thought I'd run down and see
how you all was getting along.
- Just about the way you predicted.
- We miss you, Fidelia.
You just give me that apron and let
Fidelia finish what you was doing.
Nothing of the kind.
You must be tired. Now sit down.
Child, would you mind
running along?
I got some troublement I wants
to unburden onto your mother.
- You go on upstairs, dear.
- I'll come up and tuck you in.
All right.
Mother, remind me to tell you
about the momentous deal I made.
All right, honey.
- Sit here, Fidelia.
- Thank you.
You see, Miz Hilton,
it's this way...
them uptown folks
is all right in their way,
but it's that lazy trash
they got working for 'em.
Miz Hilton, I just won't abode
in the same quarters with them.
When I finishes my work,
I wants my solitude
and I wants my privitation.
Fidelia, I'd do anything
if I could have you back,
- but things aren't any better...
- I knows.
Your bills
is runnin' awful high.
"High" isn't the word for it.
But how do you know?
I hopes you won't think
I'm buttin' in,
but I been keepin'
mighty close touch,
and when I heard tell this afternoon
about that Colonel Smellett...
And here I'm makin'
all that easy money,
and I reflects maybe you wouldn't
mind renting me my old room.
Now, you know I'd never
take any money from you.
That room was always yours,
and it always will be.
I figured you wouldn't take my money,
so I got it figured out.
I can work here on my days off,
and nights, too.
I'm strong as a horse.
Oh, no. You're not as young
as you used to be.
You're not gonna do
any work for us.
It'll be wonderful
just to have you in the house.
Miz Hilton, that's the most beautiful
thing I ever heard anybody say
in all my born days.
If you don't mind,
I'll just go get my bag.
You shouldn't bother
going back for it tonight.
It ain't no bother, Miz Hilton.
It's sittin' right here.
This whole moral breakdown
is being caused by drinking
and nothing else.
They certainly serve
rotten scotch at this bar.
I should go with what?
That's what I want to know.
The one I was with
sure was a dope.
He didn't know
where he'd been
or where he was going
or anything!
I haven't got anything
against red fingernails,
but it's carrying it too far
when they paint their toes.
I bought six dozen
before the hoarders got there.
I can't write him
everything the baby says
one one of those
little V-mail forms.
Emily, let's not go to the bar.
I could use a drink, but...
Don't be so old-fashioned.
Will you let us through, please?
I've been here 20 minutes, and...
Of course, go right ahead.
I was leaving anyway.
He's rather nice-looking,
don't you think?
Still have your
weather eye out?
There are compensations
for being a divorcée.
Bartender!
- Anne, what do you imagine you'd like?
- Anything at all. You order for me.
You make a good Planter's Punch?
I'll make 'em, and if you don't like 'em,
you don't need to drink 'em.
All right, then two.
With light rum.
I knew I had something
to talk to you about.
That vicious tongue
Vivian Robinson with the bad skin
is saying
you've taken in a roomer.
I tried to tell her
it must be a relative.
No, that's the truth.
I've taken a roomer.
We need the money.
If things are that bad,
Tim Hilton had no business
going into the Army.
To be honest,
I don't understand it myself,
but I knew that Tim was miserable
from the start not being in it.
All these irresponsible 40-year-old
fathers dashing off into uniform.
Does it always
have to be Tim?
- Tony!
- Yes. The eternal also-ran.
Emily, do you know
Lieutenant Willett? Mrs. Hawkins.
I've never had the pleasure, but I've
always had a soft spot for Navy men.
How do you do?
I didn't know
you'd turned into a barfly.
I've been trying
to get you on the phone
to tell you that your
old lover was back in town.
Do you want
the whole town to know?
If you want to be
hypocritical about it.
I heard that Tim
had been shipped out,
so I went to the admiral and convinced him
I'd chartered the Great Lakes.
Fine. How long are we going
to be honored with your presence?
Long enough to get ready
for a shakedown cruise.
If you're not stubborn,
that ought to give me the time I need.
Don't you think so,
Mrs. Hawkins?
I really don't know, I'm sure.
- I think you believe him!
- I can't say I blame you much.
You're what I call
a discerning woman.
Tony's our oldest friend.
He was Tim's best man.
We can give Mrs. Hawkins
the vital statistics some other time.
Let's get out of here.
I need more privacy.
- I haven't touched my drink.
- We can get another one.
Don't let us rush you,
Mrs. Hawkins. Good-bye.
- What about the check?
- Don't bother, Lieutenant.
- I'll take care of it.
- That's fine.
But, Tony...
Good-bye, Emily.
That was a terribly rude thing
to do to poor Emily.
Poor Emily, my foot.
Do you know of any place
in this gay metropolis
where I can conquer
my two passions at the same time?
You've been leading me on. There is
someone on the Lakes besides me.
Don't be silly.
I'm talking about you...
you and a nice thick steak.
The white fish,
is simply delicious.
Grilled. You'll like it.
Two steaks, thick.
Lobster creole,
speciality of the house.
- Two steaks, thick.
- I must tell the truth, Commodore.
We are fresh out of steaks
since last Tuesday.
This is a steak house. It says
right here..."thick Kansas City steak."
I can't help it,
- There is a war on, you know.
- There's a war on, you know.
Yes, I found that out.
Bring us whatever you have...
anything but hash.
You will be very happy. You'll see.
What are you looking
so depressed about?
My life is an endless series
of disappointments...
no steak, nobody loves me.
You wouldn't think so if you'd heard the kids
when I told them you were in town.
I can't figure out just what
special charm you have for them.
They have better taste
than their mother.
I think they believe
you're some kind of genius.
Those cover girls you used
to paint for romantic tales
really gave you glamour
in their eyes.
Gone are the days.
Still, there is a certain similarity
between a beautiful woman
and a battleship.
There must be, or else why would you
be so interested in battleships?
You got me wrong, Anne.
As far as I'm concerned, there never
was a beautiful woman but you.
Ever since that summer the crowd
of us went to the Thousand Islands
and I first saw you standing
on that little yawl.
You had on that white
bathing suit. Remember?
With your hair
blowing in the wind.
Why, Tony Willett!
When did you get back?
- Hello, sugar.
- Give me a ring.
Yes, I will. I will.
We were in the Thousand Islands
with my hair blowing in the wind.
Really, Anne,
that was nobody at all,
just a girl I happened to meet
the last time I was in town.
Tony, you don't have to
apologize to me.
I'd be disappointed
if you ever changed.
When we get home, I'll show you
something to prove...
What do you mean,
when "we" get home?
You certainly mean
to put me up?
Probably can't get a room
anyplace else.
The hotels are jammed.
Why do these things
always happen to me?
I don't see why it should
be any hardship to you.
You ought to have
plenty of room.
You think you're
going to share my room?
The girls can double up.
The girls have already
doubled up.
- We have a lodger.
- A lodger?
Don't start.
I had enough of it from Emily.
- We needed the money.
- Get a job.
You look perfectly able-bodied
to me, if I may use the word "body."
What on earth could I do?
You could do plenty
if you really wanted to.
Let's skip it.
I don't want to hear a serious word
out of either of us until I leave.
Tony, it's so good to see you.
Next to Tim being home on leave,
it's the nicest thing...
There you go again.
I buy you a beautiful dinner,
and what thanks do I get?
Tim. Tim.
What's that?
Speciality of the house...
chicken hash.
Well, blow me down.
I think Uncle Tony must be
the most distinguished-looking
officer in the whole Navy.
Admiral King's not so bad.
I mean young officers, silly.
You'd better finish your homework
and stop mooning around.
And the governor said
to the admiral, "16-inch guns?
Land sakes, can't they shoot
any further than that?"
- Uncle Tony!
- Jane!
What's the matter?
You don't seem
very glad to see me.
But I am. I am.
Honestly, I am.
- Uncle Tony!
- Brig!
That's what I call
a real reception.
- You're not staying with us?
- Yes, he's staying with us.
Don't go spoiling him. We're going to
have enough trouble as it is.
Uncle Tony
couldn't be any trouble.
It's just wonderful
having him here.
Don't listen to your mother.
I'm counting on you spoiling me.
There's just one thing, please.
Do you think you and Brig
could cut out that "Uncle" stuff?
I'm not your uncle.
It makes me feel 108.
You mean we're gonna have to
call you Lieutenant Willett?
"Tony" to you, Miss Hilton.
That must be the taxi driver
with that mysterious object
you lugged along.
You won't be so indifferent
when you see what it is.
I don't know
what this thing is,
but could be the side
of a house, I suppose.
- I ain't got no change.
- Don't worry, I borrowed it myself.
Thanks, Captain.
Thanks a lot.
Say, lady, it sure must be nice
having your husband home again.
Well, he's not my...
What's so funny about that?
Lmagine anybody
taking you for Pop.
You think your pop's
wonderful, don't you?
- Well, he is.
- But you don't have to rub it in.
I'll take your bags upstairs... Tony.
Don't bother, Jane.
- I don't mind, really.
- Brig, you take one, too.
If we don't give the lieutenant service,
he might not stay here.
- Aye-aye, sir.
- Carry on, mates.
Put them in Brig's room.
I'll move in with you girls.
That'll be fun.
Fun, indeed. I thought I was
through with dormitories.
You'll get to know
your children better.
Who's that?
Is there something
gone bad, Miz Hilton?
I wouldn't call it anything good.
If it isn't
my old girlfriend Fidelia.
Is that Mr. Tony Willett?
I thought we was through with you
till the duration was over.
Lieutenant Willett's going to be
our guest for a while.
- Happy surprise, Fidelia?
- I don't know about "happy."
Don't you let these people turn
your home into no boardinghouse.
Well, Fidelia!
I've half a mind not to stay.
But the other half
tells me to forgive you.
- What's that?
- I almost forgot.
May as well have
the unveiling right now.
Wait a minute.
I wanna see, too!
Let's have a little light on it.
I offered it to the Navy.
- Tony, I am flattered!
- That's mighty nice.
Mother, it's just like you!
And so pretty.
Well, it's really not much.
I heard they needed new
recruiting posters for the Waves,
and I figured that your face
was the one that...
Tony Willett, I might have known!
Mr. Willett, you cover that thing
right up this here minute!
Jane, you's no business
looking at that.
Tony, the Navy Department
didn't accept it?
No. I never even
found out why.
I got the painting back,
and the next thing, I was on sea duty.
Red tape, I guess.
I hope you're having
enough trouble.
I wouldn't wish this on a Jap.
- Give it a little push, Jane.
- All right, Tony.
- Nice going, Jane!
- Tony, I'm so sorry!
Never mind, Jane. I'm sure
your mother put you up to it.
No, honestly, Tony!
- Which way do I take this thing?
- Starboard on the port side.
- Here, I'll help you.
- How you gonna get the bed in?
- How am I going to what?
- We'll put the mattress on the floor.
Don't worry, I love
to sleep on the floor.
Come on.
Good evening, Colonel Smollett.
I've taken one of
the mattresses out of your room.
One mattress is entirely sufficient.
Colonel Smollett, may I present
an old friend of ours Lieutenant Willett.
- How are you, Colonel Smollett?
- How do you do?
I take it your commission
is in the Navy.
- That's right, sir.
- Doesn't surprise me.
We'll get the bed set up
in the morning.
- I'm moving in with the girls.
- It's quite all right.
I assume you're taking the one
I have not been using?
- Of course.
- That's fine.
Is something wrong
with one of the beds?
It's just that monstrous animal
that seems to be so attached to it.
Good night.
- Mother.
- Yes, Jane?
Mother, do you think
I have a nice figure?
Yes, darling.
You have a beautiful figure.
Do you think Tony
might paint me someday?
Over my dead body.
Wettookit. Wettookit.
- You must have the name wrong.
- No.
Here it is in Pop's letter.
"We're here in Texas
on maneuvers...
"...in a little town
called Wettookit.
We came, we saw, we took it!"
"We took it."
Very funny. I would
appreciate it, my dear Bridget,
if in the future you could spare me
from your father's elaborate puns.
I suppose to some people, that creature
comes under the heading of "pets."
I beg your pardon,
Colonel Smollett.
There's someone here to see you...
your grandson.
- William?
- Hello, Grandpa!
To what peculiar
combination of circumstances
do I owe this visit, William?
Well, you see, I was transferred
out here to Chamberlain Field.
- I found out at your office...
- Indeed?
I wasn't aware
that the United States forces
had been honored
by your membership.
I enlisted, sir, last summer.
So...
I don't think we need trouble these
women with your autobiography.
Let's go into the living room.
If you will excuse me.
Excuse me.
I presume you've come to me
for help of one sort or another
with your tail
between your legs.
No, sir.
I thought you might like...
- You see...
- Or is it money that you're after.
Speak up, boy.
I thought you
might like to see me.
A very mistaken notion
if ever you had one,
and you've had plenty,
as we're both well aware.
After all, I thought that we may not
see one another again.
I don't know when
I'll be shipped out.
Come, William.
Let's not
dramatize these things.
There's no need for any pretense
of affection between us.
You've paid your courtesy call.
All right, if that's
the way you feel about it.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
You may drop me a line
with your address.
And if you have any affairs
that require attention,
I shall have my lawyers
look after them.
For your late father's sake.
Now, I am sure
you will excuse me.
I'm a bit tired.
Good-bye, Grandpa.
What do you suppose?
I'm going in
and speak to him.
Mr. Smollett?
I'm Jane Hilton.
This is our home.
I see.
I'm glad to meet you.
I hope you like the Army.
That is, I mean,
are you on leave?
Just for the day.
I'll be at Chamberlain for a while,
I suppose, until we're shipped.
That'll be nice.
I don't mean
about you being shipped.
I didn't mean that either.
I hope you don't think
I'm a murderer or something.
Grandfather just doesn't like me.
I don't think it's right.
I think it's just terrible of him.
He's not so bad. He has good reasons,
the way he looks at it.
I've kind of disappointed him.
I don't care what you did.
You're a soldier now.
And you enlisted, too.
I heard you say so.
That isn't really so very much.
Lots of men enlisted.
But it's awfully nice of you
to talk to me this way.
Hi, Brig.
What's with the colonel?
He's storming around his room
like one of the Smith Brothers
with a hot foot.
I'll go up to my room
and do some homework.
Hello.
Uncle... I mean Tony.
Lieutenant Willett,
this is Private William Smollett.
How are you?
Corporal. Engineers, isn't it?
- Yes, Lieutenant.
- I'm sorry.
- You're related to the colonel?
- I'm his grandson.
- But I don't know, sir...
- Think nothing of it.
I cut my grandfather off
without a cent.
Well, Jane, what's the program
for this afternoon?
How about you and Brig
taking me out?
William here... or do they call
you Bill? ...could make a fourth.
That's nice of you, Lieutenant,
but I couldn't.
Besides, if you'll forgive
my saying so, sir, you're an officer...
I forgot all about that.
You're right.
Let's see, Jane,
what could we do?
Anything you say, Tony.
We could have tea
in the garden.
That's fine. We could
play some darts maybe.
Thank you, sir, but I ought to
be getting back to the field.
You've both been very nice.
Next time you're in town.
Will you be off next Sunday?
- How about it, Jane?
- That would be lovely.
I'll look forward to it.
Well, I'd better be going.
- Good-bye, Miss Hilton.
- It's nice to know you.
So long, and next war,
come into the Navy.
Thanks. Thank you, sir. I will.
Well, good-bye.
That seems like
a very nice boy.
- Yes, he is a nice boy, but...
- Now, Jane.
You take the word
of your old Uncle Tony
and be kind to that boy
the next time he comes here.
- Well, he's nice enough, but...
- But what?
Well, he's so young.
Besides, he isn't
even an officer.
Why, Jane, I'm surprised at you.
Those are the boys
who do the fighting,
and largely for their dreams
of girls like you.
Far be it from me
to run down officers.
You go right on advertising us.
Every little bit helps.
- Tony, I wish...
- What do you wish, little Janie?
I wish I were 27.
Now, that's a coincidence.
So do I.
Where's that Brig?
Do you suppose she ran out on us?
I've got a nickel bet with her
on Twenty Questions.
Good evening, Mrs. Hawkins.
Let me help you down.
My, but you're strong, Lieutenant!
Here, men,
help the young ladies.
Yes, sir!
Mrs. Hawkins,
I'm so frightened.
There's nothing to be frightened of.
Just go in and dance.
This here vehicle
got Susie Fleming aboard?
But a boy named Spencer
was supposed to meet me here.
Come on. Just go into the cloakroom
and they'll give you your nametag.
It's like a great big prom, isn't it?
Mind you, Becky, dear,
leave a few boys for the other girls.
Miss Hilton! Miss Hilton!
Come on, Jane.
Don't dawdle.
Will you tell me when Mother
and Lieutenant Willett arrive?
Just look for me at the committee
table and I'll help you find them.
Hello, Miss Hilton.
May I have your first dance?
Well, I really don't know
what arrangements have been made.
I just can't figure out what could
have happened to Susie Fleming.
Would it be too much of a favor
to ask you to call me Bill?
Well, I don't know you very well,
but all right, Bill.
- Hello, Emily.
- Hello, Anne.
Hello, Lieutenant Willett!
I'm delighted you could
come to our little party.
I practically had to
tie him up and drag him.
He was afraid there wouldn't
be another officer here.
There are a few.
You should see Captain Higgs.
That profile...
But I do believe you're
the only Naval man in the place.
I'll bet they give me three cheers
and a long periscope.
You'll have a good time.
Wait and see.
I suppose your first dance
is with Anne.
But remember,
the second is mine.
That's too kind of you,
Mrs. Hawkins.
If only I didn't
have this charley horse.
Naturally,
if you're indisposed...
I promised Tony
he wouldn't have to stay long.
If you'll excuse me, I have
a number of things to take care of.
Emily, would you keep an eye
on Jane after we leave?
Why, certainly, my dear.
I'll devote the entire evening to her.
Well, of all the phony battle-axes
I've ever met.
Now, really, Tony,
you asked for that.
What am I doing here
with all these kids anyway?
Why, Tony Willett.
When on earth
did you get back in town?
Hello, sugar.
Give me a ring sometime
when you're on the loose.
Yeah. Yeah.
As I was saying, what am I
doing here with these kids?
That was a cute kid, too.
It's just a girl
I went to college with.
I'll bet.
- I'm Johnny Mahoney.
- Of course! How are you?
Lieutenant Willett,
this is Johnny Mahoney.
Your father told me
you were stationed out here.
Dad bores everybody
talking about me.
He has every right
to brag about you.
Well, I don't know
about that, Mrs. Hilton.
I wanted to thank you
for what you said
about Mr. Hilton
helping me after the war.
I thought maybe you might think
I was taking advantage.
I didn't want you to feel
any obligation.
There's no obligation, Johnny.
Anybody who gets you
will be very lucky.
I'm afraid the luck's all mine,
and that's the way it's been
my whole life.
I guess
I have to be leaving now.
I thought the dance
was just getting underway.
I stopped in
to pick up my gunner.
I'm taking off in a few minutes.
It's just a routine flight.
- Good night, Johnny.
- Good night, Mrs. Hilton.
- Good night, Lieutenant.
- Good night.
Those kids just break my heart.
They're so eager.
I know.
They expect to come back
to something.
What do you mean, Tony?
Something like they left,
only better.
Hope they don't get
too many surprises.
- Hello, Bill.
- Good evening, sir.
- Hello, Tony.
- Hi, Janie.
Mother, I don't believe
you've met Bill Smollett.
I'm so sorry I missed you
at the house the other day.
Thank you, Mrs. Hilton.
Your daughter has been very nice to me.
Well, that's good.
You children run along
and have a good time.
We'll be leaving soon.
Tony, aren't you going to dance
with me even once?
Go ahead, Tony.
Jane, I'm really
very proud of you.
You're the nicest-looking girl
in the place.
Tony, do you think so?
If only I thought
you really thought so.
Really, I haven't waltzed
very much, Mrs. Hilton.
- Would you rather we stopped?
- Bill, you invited me to dance,
and you're going to see it through
whether you like it or not.
Of course, Mrs. Hilton.
I'm only too happy.
I think travel broadens one so.
Don't you think so?
I hope so.
I'll be doing plenty of it.
Do you think the artistic life
is too bohemian?
Indeed I do.
And look what happened
to Bohemia.
- Did you lose something?
- Yes, ma'am. Susie Fleming.
I'm beginning to get
right worried about her.
I just love modern
American painting. Don't you?
You're the true
American art, darling.
Nobody else ever
says things like you.
I'm so sorry, sir.
My fault. I ought to watch
where I'm going.
It's all right.
We know you didn't mean it.
- It's over.
- And very nice it was, too.
Jane, I think I ought
to be behind you.
I hope we can find
Mother and Tony.
What do you think
you're doing anyway?
I ain't used to dancing.
I'm used to pushing a plow.
You're not kidding.
I bet Emily
put some vinegar in this.
If you're not careful,
I'll think you don't like Emily.
As soon as we leave here,
you better buy me a drink.
That's the least I'm entitled to.
Hello, Tony.
I didn't know you were in town.
Hello, Sam. It's quite a dance
you fellows are putting on.
- You look upset.
- Just got some bad news.
- Good evening, Mrs. Hilton.
- Good evening, Major.
Plane crash. Don't say anything.
It might spoil the fun.
That's too bad.
Where'd it happen?
Right outside town.
Lost one of my best boys.
- What was his name?
- Mahoney.
- He hit some wires.
- Not Johnny!
- Did you know him?
- But it can't be!
We were talking to him
just a little while ago.
I'm extremely sorry, Mrs. Hilton.
I had no idea that you knew him.
I shouldn't have said anything.
It was just that
I liked Johnny very much.
- I know his father.
- A terrible thing.
Beg your pardon, sir.
The car's ready, sir.
- Be right there.
- Yes, sir.
I've got to go
and examine the wreck.
Not a very pleasant job,
I can tell you.
- Good night.
- So long, Sam.
Tony, how awful.
His poor parents.
Lucky Johnny.
Come on, Anne, let's dance.
Dance?
Look, Anne, you'll be
hearing plenty of things like this.
Might as well
get used to them now.
I feel so good!
Don't you feel good?
Well, now, my Susie...
she's what I'd call a one-man woman.
I love to read books.
They're so significant.
Why do they call you Wolf?
Is that your nickname?
You hear what they're playing?
Yes.
As I remember, you and Tim drove
everybody crazy wherever you went,
having them play the thing
over and over again.
Please, Tony,
whistle something else.
I thought that was your favorite...
next to  of course.
Don't joke.
All right, have it your way...
no jokes.
- What is your pleasure?
- I'm sorry.
You wanted a drink.
Let's go someplace.
- You feel like it?
- Sure I do.
Honest?
No. Frankly, I don't
feel much like it.
Neither do I.
It's pleasant being
in a car again.
We used to take
everything for granted.
Now I feel like a king
because I can rent one for a week.
- It's one of 'em, all right.
- You weren't speeding.
Have things changed around here?
Do you have to be doing something
now before you get a ticket?
Where do you think you're going?
I wish I knew. What's your guess?
Gibraltar? New Guinea? Kiska?
- You stationed around here?
- Yes and no.
I don't want to be rude,
but we're not in a chatty frame of mind.
Would you mind filling out one
of those slips and getting it over with?
- You weren't doing anything.
- I wasn't?
What's all this about?
It gets so lonely along this road
since gas rationing.
Say, ain't it a beautiful night?
I hadn't noticed it before,
but now that you mention it...
Guess I'd better
be checkin' in.
Nice to have met up
with you folks.
Good night.
Get one of them Japs for me!
If I lay my hands on one,
I'll give him a ticket.
He's what Brig
would call a character.
It can have my vote.
Do you realize we're laughing?
Well, so we are.
What do you know?
What, Tony?
Sometimes I wish...
How'd you like a cigarette?
I'd love one. I don't believe
I've had a cigarette in a month.
I've never had such a dramatic
buildup to a cigarette before.
You know what
I was just thinking?
I like you best
when you're not thinking.
That's right, run me down.
Tony Willett, the jolly fellow.
Always good for a laugh.
You're not really going
to be wounded, not by me.
No. If you haven't
wounded me by now,
I guess I'm impervious, Anne.
I would like to tell you
what I was thinking.
All right,
what were you thinking?
I was just thinking what fun
it would be sometimes
to be a good, heavy,
synthetic rubber heel.
It would be synthetic, Tony.
Is it all right now
if I whistled
Go right ahead.
I'd like to join in.
I just can't believe that
by tomorrow, Tony will be gone.
There are enough carrots here
to feed a cavalry regiment...
men  horses.
I think next to Pop, Tony must
be the nicest man in the world.
- Bridget, please.
- What, Colonel?
If you'll excuse me,
I've had enough this morning.
In fact, I think that henceforth,
you may operate this victory garden
entirely by yourself.
Golly, what did I do?
Since you're so obtuse...
"Tony, Tony, Uncle Tony."
I'd better look
for quarters elsewhere
since that's the way
I'm regarded around here.
Colonel Smollett, I wouldn't hurt
your feelings for anything.
It's not a question
of my feelings.
After all, a man
does have his pride.
There's the postman.
Maybe it's a letter from Pop!
You'll wait here, won't you?
- Mother! Mother! Mother!
- What's all the excitement about?
It's a letter to Jane and me
from Pop!
Well, bring it up.
Come on, honey, time to get up.
Mother, listen!
Pop says he may get leave soon!
Let me see!
What's that about Pop?
Look!
- Jane, let me look at you.
- What's the matter?
Darling, I'm afraid
you have the mumps.
- Mumps.
- Mumps?
Oh, Mother!
Tony's last day.
Only children have mumps.
You sure you ain't leavin'
nothin' here?
Just my love, Fidelia.
You afraid maybe I'll come back?
I ain't sorry you're goin'.
Now, Fidelia, I always say
nice things about you.
I ain't got no time
for them complimentaries.
Besides, now that Miss Jane
got herself some mumps,
we need this room
for Miz Hilton and Brig.
At least give me credit
for good timing.
Don't bother with that.
I'll take it down.
I want to be sure it gets down.
I've got a going-away present
for you, Fidelia.
Here it is.
Always remember, a great master
devoted some of his last hours
to you before he went off to war.
You like it?
I tried not to flatter you.
Why, Mr. Willett...
it's just the way
I always wanted to look.
Someday I'll do you in oil.
I haven't much time. I want
to say good-bye to everybody.
You say your farewells.
I'll tote your bag for you.
That's very nice of you.
Mr. Willett, I must
have been stone blind
not to see what
a lovely gentleman you is.
- Leaving, Lieutenant?
- On my way, Colonel.
I'll tell Miz Hilton
you's ready, Mr. Tony.
I rather envy you,
if I may say so.
We could use you, sir.
In the Navy?
- Good luck, Mr. Willett.
- Thank you, sir.
I guess we have to have a Navy.
- Don't come in, please!
- Don't you want to say good-bye?
I have an awful disease.
Can't scare me.
I'm coming in.
Wait a minute, Tony, please.
- All right, Jane?
- Yes.
But I wish you wouldn't.
Hello, Janie.
Hello, Tony.
You look fine in that kerchief.
Probably start a new fashion.
- I look terrible.
- No, you don't.
You could never look terrible.
You're pretty, that's what you are.
Don't laugh at me.
I never laugh
at anybody I love.
And I've loved you
from the moment you were born.
Is that all?
It's the best love I have, Janie.
It's a special kind of love
I keep just for Anne and Tim
and the two sweet girls
who are part of Anne and Tim.
Tony, you're going way
and maybe you'll be killed,
and I've got the mumps
just like a baby.
I hope the mumps are the worst
things that ever happen to you.
I won't be killed. Only the good
die young... haven't you heard?
And I'm neither good nor young.
But, Tony, you're just
the right age for a man.
Little Janie.
Wanna make a bet?
What?
I'll bet by the time I see you again,
you're in love.
You're silly.
You're the silliest man I ever knew.
Now you're making sense.
I knew you had a good head.
Will you write to me?
There won't be anything to write.
There won't be anything
happening after you're gone, ever.
All right.
But I'll write to you.
I have to go now, dear.
Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Janie.
- Bye, Tony.
I'll write to you.
I'll write to you all the time.
You'll catch the mumps.
Do you want to keep them
all to yourself?
Besides, I'm no hero.
I've had the mumps. I'm immune.
I wish...
Let me wish this time.
I wish that I was 17.
What are you doing
sitting in that holy of holies
as though it were yours?
I'm getting it used
to being just another chair.
- Can I wake her up?
- You'd better.
She'd never forgive you
if you left without saying good-bye.
If ever I have any children,
God will punish me... they'll be boys.
I couldn't possibly have
anything as nice as that.
The first step usually
is to get married.
- Are you leaving soon, Tony?
- In just a little while.
Say good-bye to Tony, darling.
It's way past your bedtime.
I want to talk to him
before he leaves.
- Good-bye, Tony.
- Good-bye, Brig, dear.
It's sort of like
saying good-bye to Pop again.
Coming from you, Brig,
that's the compliment
to top all compliments.
I'll have another kiss on that.
- Your cab's here, Mr. Tony.
- Thank you, Fidelia.
Would you ask him
if he'd mind waiting?
I got it all arranged.
He's waiting.
Good-bye, Tony.
Come back soon.
Good night, Mother.
Good night, darling.
- Don't catch those mumps.
- What do you think I am, a child?
- Happy dreams.
- Happy landing.
- Bye, Mr. Tony.
- Good-bye, Fidelia.
I'll take myself
along now before I...
Just when did you
captivate Fidelia?
It was my art that did the trick.
I sketched her.
As a Wave?
Sometimes your ingratitude
saddens me.
- You'll recover.
- I've got to leave in three minutes.
Tony, I'm so sorry
to see you go.
We've all loved having you.
By the way,
how did you leave Jane?
With the mumps.
And with tears, I'm afraid.
I haven't much tact, I guess.
I didn't know what to say.
I know. Poor dear.
But you are very attractive, Tony.
- A bone from Mrs. Hilton.
- No, I mean it.
It won't be too easy for Jane,
getting over it.
Nonsense. Older men...
every girl goes through it. Didn't you?
- Still going through it.
- Yeah. Older men named Hilton.
Don't you ever worry about Jane.
I won't, as long as
the older men are like you.
You know something, Anne?
I'm chump enough to go on
living on your compliments
for the next six months.
Like a camel and water,
you know?
- How long can they go?
- I never knew one.
Tony, don't tell me any secrets,
but is it action this time?
Down the St. Lawrence,
and then I don't even know myself.
- I won't say what I feel.
- No, don't.
You'd better get some rest.
You look tired.
I will. I have a little
letter-writing to do first.
I see.
How often do you write him?
You won't think me foolish
if I tell you?
I try to write at least
a few lines every night.
You know that's a little nuts.
It's pretty wonderful, too.
Well, good night, Anne.
Good night, Tony.
Come here.
You're a swell guy, Tony.
Go away.
Well, she finally hit one.
Now don't drop it.
Bowl it.
It's no use, Bill.
I'll never learn.
Sure you will.
- I hurt my thumb.
- I'm so sorry. Let me see.
It's your turn now, Bill.
Let's see if you can
knock them all down.
Well, I don't know about that.
Like a piece of tape?
Thank you.
It's your turn now, Jane.
I was just...
He just gave me a piece of tape.
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi.
- Have a smoke?
- No.
I'd advise you
to mind your own business.
I know she's a nice girl.
Anybody could see that.
I don't like
your laughing either.
Bill, please come down
and show me again how to do it.
Look, buddy, you can
have a fight if you want it,
but I was just trying
to be friendly.
Well, all right, then.
- Bill, speak to me.
- Gee, I'm sorry.
- Look what you've done.
- I didn't do anything.
I guess that'll teach him.
You know, I've never been
to the beach in my whole life.
- I've never seen the ocean.
- You haven't?
I never saw it
till a couple of months ago.
But you're a sailor.
- I was brought up on a farm.
- I see.
- I've never been on a farm.
- You haven't?
I was brought up
on an Army post.
I see.
I have to catch a train.
Gotta be back at the base
in the morning.
Sure wish you could spend
the rest of the evening with us.
No, you don't.
I've butted in enough already.
- No, we loved meeting you.
- Sure we did.
I'll catch a bus here.
- So long, buddy.
- Good-bye.
You've both been swell.
You're the only people I met
since I came to town.
Why didn't you go
to the canteen?
They're so crowded and everything,
and I don't dance so very good.
You and me both.
Next time you come to town,
maybe we can all go bowling again.
Gee, I don't know
if I'll ever be back this way.
I expect we'll get going
any day now.
The war looks
pretty good, doesn't it?
It sure does.
Well, good-bye, miss.
My name's Harold E. Smith.
I'm Bill Smollett,
and this is Miss Hilton.
- How are you?
- Jane's my first name.
- Good-bye, Jane.
- Good-bye.
- Bye, Harold.
- Hal.
Bye, Hal.
- He's nice.
- Yeah, he's a nice fella.
You were sweet to him, Bill.
I'm sorry about...
I acted like a fool.
- He's good-looking, isn't he?
- Is he? I hadn't noticed.
- You must have noticed.
- Well, I didn't.
Come on, let's get a soda.
No chocolate. We only have vanilla
flavoring, but no ice cream.
- Would you like Victory Punch?
- What's that?
It's a loganberry phosphate
with lime.
- That sounds fine.
- We'll make it two.
But you could have a vanilla soda
without any ice cream maybe.
That's right, I could, couldn't I?
I'll try it.
One Victory and one
vanilla soda with no ice cream.
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Of course not.
Bill, why are you so...
so timid about things?
What do you mean, Jane?
I mean about asking
if you can smoke.
Nobody else does that.
And, well, I mean everything.
Is it...
I hope you won't think
I'm being forward,
but is it something
to do with your grandfather?
No, it isn't that.
Although I suppose I've always
been sort of scared of Grandpa.
But why?
I dug up a scoop
of vanilla ice cream for you.
Please pay the cashier and buy
war stamps with your change.
I will.
You see, my father
was a soldier.
He was a colonel
when he died.
I guess all the Smolletts
all the way back were soldiers.
One of them was
with Washington at Yorktown.
Although sometimes I think
Grandpa just made that one up.
I'm sure he didn't.
You ought to be awfully proud.
I'm proud, all right.
But something
went wrong with me.
Mother died when I was born,
so I never knew her.
Of course I never knew her.
That's a shame.
She could paint pretty well...
china and things.
I hope I can show you
her work sometime.
That is, if Grandpa...
If Grandpa what?
Well, if I go home.
You see, I haven't
lived home since West Point.
West Point?
You don't want to hear
all about this, do you?
Not if you don't want me to, Bill.
But I do, of course.
There's no one in the whole world
that I'd rather tell.
Isn't your soda all right?
Yeah. I just don't
feel much like it.
I thought I did, but...
You don't have to drink it, Bill.
Would you rather go home and talk?
We could sit on the porch.
Swell. I'd like that.
So would I.
There. Now we can relax.
You were talking about how your
grandfather wanted you to be a soldier.
Would you like
a sandwich or something?
He wanted me to be a general.
But didn't you want
to be a general?
Well, no, I didn't.
But why not, Bill?
I had an idea it was more
important to build things.
I don't mean it isn't important
being a soldier.
I don't know how we'd keep
the things we build without them.
But you said you went
to West Point.
I should think you'd be
a lot more than a...
More than a corporal, you mean.
Let's have a picnic sometime.
I'll bring a...
Bill, I didn't mean that.
It's wonderful being a corporal.
No, you meant that
if I went to the Academy,
I ought to be
more than a corporal.
Well, you might as well know it.
I was kicked out
and I broke Grandpa's heart.
I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
Yes, it was.
Bill, come and sit down.
Look. Grandpa's father carried
this watch at Vicksburg.
Grandpa gave it to me
on my tenth birthday.
He had it engraved for me.
Read it.
I'll light a match.
"To William G. Smollett,
the Second,
who will lead men
to glory on the battlefield."
You must have been
terribly pleased.
I said, "Grandpa, don't people
hurt each other in war?"
You see, I was only ten.
He took the watch away from me.
But he gave it back to me again
when I entered the Academy.
Jane, I did my best, but I
could never make a good officer.
I can't lead men, and I know it.
Even if I'd led my class
the way Grandpa...
"Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandpa."
What about yourself?
Why is it so important
that you satisfy him, the old...
Because he loved me so.
Yeah, I'm sure he did... once.
But all through military school,
from the time I was eight,
I kept letting him down.
I never even wanted to play
with the tin soldiers he gave me.
Grandpa kept telling me
that if I was a Smollett, I'd...
But I guess I was always...
well, you know... weak.
I was a joke at the Academy.
I only lasted a couple of months.
Grandpa couldn't face
his old cronies.
Well, that's it.
Now you can see what a mess
I made out of everything.
You've done no such thing.
You're fine and strong,
but you're just sensitive... that's all.
But don't you think I'm a failure
after everything I've told you?
A failure? Just because
you're not an officer?
An officer I know said that you
are the boys doing the fighting.
- Lieutenant Willett?
- Yes.
You think a lot of him,
don't you?
Of course, but what's that
got to do with it?
You're a soldier, and I'm...
that is, we're proud of you.
And I hope you never
get promoted.
All those officers strutting around
with their gold braid and everything.
Gee, Jane, I'm so glad
you feel that way about it.
But Grandpa...
Bother Grandpa!
There's Soda. You'd better go
before we wake the colonel.
He doesn't scare me.
Not anymore, he doesn't.
Jane, let me stay long enough
for just one cigarette.
All right.
Provided you don't ask
my permission to smoke it.
I won't.
Gee, Jane,
I think you're wonderful.
"21/2 minutes... under no
circumstances more than 3."
Sometimes I think six minutes
would be more in character.
I'll serve the colonel his breakfast
this morning, Mother.
What's wrong with you
this morning anyway?
First you get up an hour early...
...and then suddenly you've turned
into Mother's little helper.
I don't know.
I just felt like it somehow.
Not that I object.
The next time Brig makes a deal,
she can put it
into execution herself.
You don't mind waiting
for our breakfast until Brig gets down?
Two sets of breakfasts
are about all I can handle.
Mother, do you like Bill?
Yes, of course.
I think he's a very nice boy.
A little shy.
Did you have a nice time last night?
If he's shy, it's that colonel's fault,
the old goat.
That's not
a very nice way to talk.
Well, he is.
He's just ruined Bill, that's what.
I'm going to have
a talk with him.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Why not?
Somebody's got to talk to him.
It's usually a good rule to stay out
of other people's business.
But maybe it's better
if you learn the hard way.
Go ahead if you want to.
You're not a baby anymore.
Just think, in another week,
I'll be graduating.
Mother, may I get a war job?
