No, it's not a sense of betrayal, sir.
l don't feel that.
But l was told l would have command
of our next blockade-runner.
l've seen myself on the bridge,
taking this ship...
from Japan into Bordeaux.
Do you know where l see myself?
ln Bremen, at home in bed with my wife.
-You have a wife, Kruse?
-No, sir.
Well, perhaps here in Tokyo
it's just as well.
Mr. Kruse, this cargo....
God Almighty, how we need this cargo.
And Capt. Mueller
is a man of such experience.
Look here.
Tomorrow my experience puts me here,
on a fine new Japanese submarine.
l am to show our friends
the wolf-pack tactics we use...
to erase so much
Allied shipping in the Atlantic.
An assignment l do not cherish, you see.
l'm grateful for the way
you put it, Adm. Wendel.
The way l put it is that,
First Officer or Admiral, we do as ordered.
lncidentally, if everything goes
according to plan...
our paths may cross.
Sir, Capt. Mueller's here to see you.
And he's impatient.
lt's a bad morning. Nobody's satisfied.
Ask Capt. Mueller to come in.
Adm. Wendel, in the Merchant Navy,
the captain chooses his own crew.
What are you doing here?
l'll be damned if l'll ship with these.
Two murderers.
Two more, ''assault with deadly weapons.''
This one, ''theft of government property.''
Another, an outright political enemy.
lt's also a good way
to return these bastards...
to Germany for the punishment
they deserve.
l'm sorry, l cannot accept them.
But they're only a handful, Captain--
l don't want a handful of maggots
in my soup!
Now, we've given you
every reliable man we could find.
And must l remind you, Capt. Mueller,
that you can't afford to protest?
Mr. Kruse, would you leave
the two of us alone?
Stand right there, Mr. Kruse.
Adm. Wendel is about
to say that my last ship...
was torpedoed in the lndian Ocean.
-Well, that's common knowledge--
-But at the time of the attack...
l had a skinful of rum.
Capt. Mueller reports that he stood on
the bridge for three days...
with a festering jaw.
lt was lanced.
Drugs were administered. No avail.
Therefore, Capt. Mueller tried liquor.
lt is said to have afforded him some relief.
The torpedo didn't know
l had been drinking.
We cannot interview that torpedo!
Be satisfied that the Admiralty
retains confidence in you.
Believe me, Mueller, take the ship.
You'll save yourself a lot of consequences.
l can take any of your consequences.
l wasn't referring to you.
But you see at home,
they are inclined to believe...
that certain behavior runs in the family.
My son?
He's on duty in the North Sea area,
isn't he?
My son is a splendid officer.
One of the finest.
-They wouldn't.
-Yes, Mueller, they would.
They have.
The cargo, Mr. Crain,
is perhaps the single most important...
item in the world today.
-Col. Statter, would you like some tea?
-No, thank you.
-The cargo, Mr. Crain, is rubber.
-Rubber?
A ship called the Ingo will leave Tokyo...
carrying 7,000 tons of raw rubber.
will keep the entire
German army on wheels...
for at least three months.
-ls this music disturbing you?
-No.
Would you like
to hear the second movement?
No.
l'm glad you admire my painting.
l bought this Kirschner in Zurich.
Yeah, l paid too much for it,
but l couldn't resist it.
You come from Zurich, Mr. Crain?
Yes, my family lives there.
Mr. Crain...
you have no family.
You're a German, Herr Schroeder.
You've been living
in a British dominion here in lndia...
on a forged Swiss passport
for the last three years.
You were a reserve officer
in an engineer demolition battalion.
The day you received orders
to report for duty...
you turned your back on your country...
and managed to leave Germany
with most of your funds.
l'm not surprised, sir, that you found me.
-l'm only surprised that it took so long.
-Oh, but it didn't.
We've not had any need for you, until now.
What we're astonished at is that
you never gave your services to the Allies.
-But buried yourself out here.
-Buried myself?
l think l have here
all that l could possibly want.
l have my books and my music
and a modest art collection.
And a visit from a beautiful lady
from time to time.
And what l value most is my privacy.
Now let me save you some valuable time.
Col. Statter, l have no intention
of blowing up the ship.
We don't want you to blow up that ship.
lt's precisely what we don't want.
We want you to save that ship.
-To save it?
-Herr Schroeder...
as you know,
the Allies are desperately short of rubber.
As much as the Germans
want their cargo...
we want it more,
and we mean to capture it.
Yes. Well, why do you come to me?
German blockade-runners have orders
to scuttle at the approach of an enemy.
But if an engineer, a demolitions expert,
boards that ship...
and disarms all the scuttling charges...
when the captain goes to scuttle,
he's gonna be a very surprised captain.
And also surprised will be the engineer,
if he lives to a ripe, old age.
Obviously, there are ways in which
this adventure might not succeed.
Yeah, perhaps a 1,000, huh?
But if it does, the Allied governments
are gonna be very grateful indeed.
And if it fails?
The Germans would shoot him.
We would've preferred a professional,
of course.
But there wasn't a qualified man anywhere
near Tokyo to get him there in time.
Schroeder...
if we capture 7,000 tons of rubber...
it's gonna save thousands of lives
and shorten the war against Hitler.
Col. Statter...
besides from the obvious suicidal aspects
of your scheme...
l personally don't believe that war is ever
a solution to political conflict.
What do wars ever prove?
Men, women, and children
are slaughtered...
and a generation later...
friends are enemies,
and enemies are friends...
and the whole stupid cycle
starts over again.
Certainly, l have great appreciation
for your noble effort...
and your interest
to save thousands of lives.
But excuse me if l seem
to be concerned for my own life.
lt's unfortunate you're rated so highly
by the Gestapo, Herr Schroeder.
Because l'm told their penalties
for deserters...
are somewhat more theatrical than ours.
No, they hold you under house arrest
until after the war is over and then...
they give you a fair trial,
as they do in England, l'm sure.
You realize you're my prisoner?
l can have you transported
back to England...
and parachute you out
of an RAF plane over Germany.
At the same time,
a valuable English officer...
held by the Germans,
will be dropped over England.
Exchange of hostages
is as old as war itself.
Perhaps blackmail is a little older, huh?
l thought the Holy British Empire
indulged in more modern ethics.
Some arrangements are being made
for you to board that ship in Tokyo.
But even if l am put aboard that ship,
it still might reach Germany.
That's right.
Or you may not be able to disarm
all the charges...
and the ship might be scuttled.
ln which case, you're likely to drown.
Or be rescued by the Germans
or by the Allies.
ln that event,
we'll still be able to make use of you.
Col. Statter, you are morally degenerate.
ln your case, l can't say
that l'm bothered by any moral nausea.
No, l'm afraid the success
of the mission is your only hope.
Couldn't you have found
a more obvious place in Calcutta?
-Like a public comfort station?
-What did you expect?
l'd hoped for something
a little more subtle.
Perhaps you'd prefer
one of our local brothels.
lt would've at least given me
some compensation for the inconvenience.
On the return trip, my dear fellow.
lf you return.
-Statter, you're a cold bastard.
-l was born on a chilly island.
Here are your personal effects:
a picture of your wife and family...
some German money...
a wedding ring...
book matches from your favorite bar
in Berlin...
more background, further instructions,
bits and pieces...
your dachshund.
Don't you have some sauerkraut
and knackwurst in there for me?
Your insignia.
Display it at all times.
You are a standard leader.
A top rank member of the SS.
You're arrogant, rude, brutal, conceited...
which should not be difficult for you.
Perhaps you would like to hear me sing
the Horst WesseI song?
No, that won't be necessary.
This is a chart
used by German merchant ships...
the first 3,000 miles outside Tokyo.
We've learned the course of yours.
lf you place this pin...
at latitude 14 degrees North,
longitude 175 East...
as you see, it makes a circle.
Now, depending on winds and currents,
your ship will enter this area...
And within it, waiting for you...
will be units of the American Navy.
-What if my ship is delayed?
-Now that's a fair question.
Our friends will be able to wait
until the sixteenth day.
So you see,
you have a full 48 hours leeway.
How nice.
The code name for that area is
the ''Keil Circle.''
And for this operation,
you will be known as Keil.
Keil.
How many scuttling charges are there
on the ship, and where are they located?
That's your riddle.
We can't be expected to know everything.
The crew believes this
to be a routine passage...
down the China Sea.
Yes, for a while, sir,
only the captain, you, and l...
are to be aware of our destination.
There are some of the reasons.
-You're whistling, sailor.
-Yes, sir, l like to whistle.
There's a superstition
about whistling on a ship.
-Beat it.
-l'm not on a ship yet.
Stay in character, Mr. Keil.
l am sorry but--
-Yeah. Best to enlighten them at the start.
-Correct, Standard Leader.
Good-bye and good luck.
HeiI Hitler.
Mr. Keil...
good luck.
Hold your fire.
We'll jump ship in Hong Kong.
Dr. Ambach...
-injured man coming aboard.
-Yes, sir.
-Now, when do you leave us?
-At point seven.
-Mr. Milkereit.
-Sir?
-After point seven, plot course 76.
-76, yes, sir.
All right.
Captain...
l have the honor
to present Mr. Hans Keil...
of the Reich Security Agency,
Division 4E5, Far East Zone.
Oh, yes. l was told a few hours ago
there'd be such a passenger.
-You've assigned Mr. Keil a cabin?
-Yes, sir.
Hope you'll be comfortable.
Check with Dr. Ambach...
and let me know when that man is ready
to report for duty.
-He wasn't that badly hurt, sir.
-Just take care of it.
Capt. Mueller...
l was wondering if you had
a few moments, if perhaps l could--
After we clear the harbor, there'll be
plenty of time to get acquainted, Mr. Keil.
-Good. l was looking forward to it.
-Well, l'm not.
After all, l know your purpose
aboard my ship.
Mr. Branner...
starboard engine, half speed.
Starboard! Half speed!
lt's my belief that political soldiers are
the lifeblood of a nation.
Even more than the military.
Wonderful observation.
You are a member of the party, Mr. Kruse?
Of course, l am.
Well, Captain,
l hope that everything is in order now.
-lt is.
-Good.
l see you're starting
your assignment early.
You're wasting your time. l don't plan
to have an infected jaw this trip.
Frankly, l'm quite surprised. l thought your
department had better use for its men.
You don't have to be discreet.
Mr. Kruse knows all about it.
About what?
Well, l can see why the Security Office
felt it wise to take precautions.
Though, l'm certain
that the captain's drinking...
and the loss of his last ship
had no connection.
l don't know about this...
but l assure you this is not the reason
why l'm on the ship.
Not at all.
Which still means
you'll be looking over my shoulder.
l don't know why you persist in this.
lt's a long voyage, and l hope
that we could find some common interest.
-Do you play the chess, sir?
-l do.
Well, then, we perhaps could have a game.
Mr. Keil, l have neither the time,
nor the desire to play chess with you.
Capt. Mueller...
l'm not accustomed to unfriendliness.
And....
l quite frankly....
l was really not prepared for it.
Do you have some particular quarrel
with SS, Captain?
l'm sure that you SS gentlemen
are very valuable on dry land...
but on this ship l have a job to do.
But how does my being on board this ship
affect your job?
My crew. Word's gotten around that
you're aboard, and they're scared to death.
This is ridiculous.
Ridiculous or not, l shall have to ask you
to confine yourself to your cabin...
the deck, and the salon.
l don't want you to interfere
with their work or mine.
Do you mean....
Am l to understand that l will not be free
to walk around the ship?
Yes, just that.
The Admiralty described you
as a passenger.
So you will have all the privileges
and the restrictions of a passenger.
They failed to describe the captain
as not only foolish but ill-mannered.
-Well, that's their blunder.
-Capt. Mueller...
l don't have to put up
with this sort of rudeness...
and l would like to suggest that you show
a little more respect for me...
for my authority,
and for the organization that l represent.
l am the master of this ship.
You're under my authority here.
Mr. Kruse...
you will attest that the captain
is not only insulting but uncooperative.
l will make a full report of this
when we reach Bordeaux.
Bordeaux?
The only report l care about,
if we reach Bordeaux...
is that Capt. Mueller brought the Ingo...
on a 15,000 mile journey
through enemy waters...
with a precious cargo, successfully.
Even if he didn't play chess on the way.
l hoped that our relations
would be pleasant...
but l see that they won't. Good night.
lf you will allow me also, Captain?
l'm due on the bridge.
Mr. Keil?
-That was outrageous.
-Yeah, perhaps.
-Allow me to apologize for him.
-No, no. You're very kind...
but this is not your concern.
But, anyway, l don't intend to comply.
Unfortunately, Standard Leader,
l must urge you to do as he says.
He is in command until Bordeaux.
Until Bordeaux? Yeah.
-Good night.
-Good night.
-Your watch is on at eight bells.
-All right, sir.
Revolution's 1,200. Steady.
Must have been a rat chewing on a wire.
Not much else to eat on this ship anyhow.
Hello, sir.
What?
l'm looking for my bird.
Are you blind?
-You work in the engine room?
-l'm the Donkeyman, sir.
-Your name is Donkeyman?
-No.
That is what they call the stoker.
Yeah.
l hope my bird isn't disturbing you, sir?
Not at all.
You are one of the men
who was brought on the ship under guard.
Yes, sir.
What is the charge against you?
-l am a political prisoner, sir.
-Political prisoner?
Falsely accused?
No, sir, not falsely accused.
Boat drill! Boat drill! To your stations!
Everybody, to your stations.
lt's time the men knew the truth.
You'll address them after the drill then?
l wouldn't make a speech
at the Föhrer's wedding.
Address them yourself.
Have you seen our passenger?
He's supposed to be at number two.
No, but l'm sure
he can take care of himself.
Oh, l'm sure he can,
but he's supposed to be at his position.
Perhaps he's waiting
for a personal invitation.
-Better get to your station, Dr. Ambach.
-Oh, yeah.
Mr. Keil?
Hold the boats!
Re-stow them !
Officers and crew, assemble on foredeck!
Officers and men,
assemble on the foredeck.
Where have you been?
Attending your boat drill.
Are you telling me
you've been here all along?
Certainly not.
There was no life jacket in my cabin,
so l was obliged to find one for myself.
l managed to locate one in this...
machine shop of yours
which, incidentally, is a filthy hole.
That cabin wasn't
supposed to be occupied.
Well, we're not being torpedoed,
are we, Captain?
lt's just a boat drill.
For security purposes, you had been told
that our destination was the China coast.
That is not the fact.
This voyage, therefore,
will not end in a few days.
lt will require another 80 days.
Journey's end will be a port in France...
occupied gloriously by our countrymen.
From now on, our watches will be armed.
Not the slightest misconduct
will be tolerated!
Thank you, Mr. Kruse. That's fine.
The watches will not be armed.
The First Officer mistook one of my orders.
As to those of you with bad records...
you will toe the line, as we all will.
Dismissed.
But, sir....
l have never captained
a prison ship before...
and don't intend to now.
-How is your insane friend today?
-Fine, sir.
Well...
this is my first voyage on a freighter.
l find it interesting.
Very interesting.
What is this machine here?
-The winch.
-Winch?
The winch for lifting the cargo.
-Oh, yes, this is the cargo hold?
-Yes, sir.
-How do you get in?
-Right from the deck, sir.
Once you get the hatch cover off.
You mean there are
no connecting doorways down below...
-from one cargo hold to the other?
-No, sir.
Not on a freighter, sir.
Better be careful.
One day, this bird of yours might fly away
with a seagull.
l promise you...
before this ship reaches port...
there's going to be one dead
SS bastard on it.
Come in.
Oh, Standard Leader.
-Come in.
-l hope l'm not disturbing.
Certainly not, Standard Leader.
-Take a seat.
-Thank you very much.
Care for a cigarette?
No, l think l won't have a cigarette.
My coming here is a gamble...
but l think l have not made
a mistake about you.
-May l speak directly?
-By all means.
l think that neither you or l are pleased...
with....
l hope you won't be offended
if l ask to see your party card.
-My party card?
-Yeah.
-This is my party card.
-Thank you.
Well, l see you've kept up
your yearly contributions.
Yes.
You know...
what constantly confounds me, is the
irony of careers in the merchant service.
We have a man like Mueller
at the top, and...
while a man like yourself,
a genuine German...
in the best sense of the phrase...
is First Officer.
But l did not knock on your door
to flatter you.
Now...
what is your opinion...
of Capt. Mueller's approach to discipline?
Discipline?
He approaches it
as if we were carrying a cargo of kimonos.
Exactly. Now...
you must realize by now
that l'm not just a passenger.
Certainly.
And l'm not here to count
the bottles of wine that Mueller drinks.
lt is necessary for me
to inspect this ship, all of it.
And l prefer that Capt. Mueller
is not made aware of this or anyone else.
Yes.
And you will be kind enough
to arrange this for me.
Now, l must ask to look
at your party card, Standard Leader.
Please drop the title when we're alone.
lt's....
May l see it?
Here.
You know, l'm...
l'm happy that you asked me this
because if you didn't, l would know...
that you were not being as alert
as you might be.
May l ask...
the purpose of your request?
l am sorry, but...
under the circumstances, l cannot afford
to take anyone into my confidence.
But thank you.
l can tell you this, which is
something that you are already aware of...
and that is that there are
political prisoners on board.
And if l were a political prisoner...
l would not be completely disappointed
if this ship did not reach Bordeaux.
l feel l should oblige you, Mr. Keil...
but to act contrary
to the orders of my superior....
Certainly, l understand, but if you should
feel the need for my support at any time--
l appreciate that very much, but...
l must think it over.
Naturally. This is logical.
But while you think it over,
l would like to remind you...
of our first allegiance.
-HeiI Hitler.
-HeiI Hitler.
-Thank you so much.
-Good night.
Good night.
Mr. Keil? Mr. Keil?
l'm sorry to interrupt you, sir,
but this is impossible for me.
l'm not prepared for a lengthy voyage.
Would you use your influence, sir?
l don't believe l understand.
Well, l have to be returned to Tokyo.
We must put about.
You have a rather
original sense of comedy, Dr. Ambach.
l know l sound absurd,
and l'm sorry to bother you with this...
but l have problems, certain problems.
Dr. Ambach, we all have problems.
But, Mr. Keil,
these are extremely serious problems.
So...
in this case,
l suggest that you swim back...
because it only takes three weeks...
and the water is not cold this time of year.
This is Radio Norddeich,
in the heart of the fatherIand...
bringing music and personaI messages...
to our gaIIant fighters
far away on IoneIy seas.
-Touching, isn't it?
-Get used to it, Branner.
lt'll follow us all the way.
Good to be back with you
after all these years, Doc.
Look at him.
Ten pounds of trousers
for two pounds of rump.
You weren't so funny
back in Cape Town, were you?
When you came crying to me
with a very far gone venereal disease...
which l found almost impossible to cure.
We interrupt this broadcast
to bring you a buIIetin of speciaI interest.
United States aircraft today attempted
their first raid on German territory.
No damage was sustained.
Our fighter pIanes shot down
-Good!
-That's wonderful.
-That'll show them, huh?
-Of course.
But what are 1 1 planes to the Americans...
when they claim
they are going to build 50,000 in a year?
Milkereit was always a pessimist...
senior grade.
''lf Adolf Hitler is steering towards war,
he's a lunatic.''
Letter to a lady friend, 1935.
The lady liked to save letters...
and the Gestapo likes to collect
all kinds of odd documents.
l have that report
in your service file, Milkereit.
But l was much younger.
l don't feel that way any longer.
Yeah, just make sure that your change
of heart is permanent, Milkereit.
And in the future, make sure
to take up with less sentimental ladies.
l once knew a girl who sang that song.
A girl back home.
Home.
lt's been almost two years.
Sir?
A message from Tokyo.
Turn that damn radio off.
''Enemy ships reported your vicinity.
''Camouflage your vessel
as British freighter immediately.''
Raise the starboard waist!
Get going.
Kruse?
Come with me. lt's urgent.
What's urgent?
This is an emergency. Come.
-Cornelson! Take over for me here.
-Yes, sir.
Kruse...
l've decided to take you
completely into my confidence.
Sabotage.
Very clever work.
Now l think you'll know
why l am on this ship.
My instructions were to handle this
by myself, but now there is no time.
You say there are 12 of these...
-scuttling charges?
-Yes.
That's sufficient.
Two or three could probably sink the ship,
so we will have to cover them all.
Now...
how many are there in this hold?
Two.
Where are they located?
One is over there,
at the end of this opening.
Run a cable from the aftermast...
to this deck.
Yes, Captain.
The last one's down here.
What is in the barrels here?
-Barrels?
-Yeah.
Lard.
-Lard?
-Yeah.
A few hundred tons from Okinawa...
for making margarine and candles.
We even have a small shipment
of oolong tea.
Thank you.
Now tell me, Kruse, where is the
master switch for these charges located?
ln the wheelhouse.
-ln the wheelhouse?
-Yeah.
Well, then l'm sure,
the Captain has the only key, huh?
Of course.
l think this one
has not been tampered with.
lt's all right.
Twelve charges and the only two damaged
are in the engine room.
The Donkeyman.
-l'll make short work of him.
-No. Wait, wait, wait.
Whoever it is,
we watch them play out their hand.
But the captain ought to be notified.
Certainly not.
Under these circumstances,
everyone is suspect...
even you.
Look here. There's help.
Very fortunate circumstance
to find an alone American ship.
Very.
We have made radio contact
with the Ingo again, Admiral.
She is on course and all is well.
-Where were your ship going?
-Australia.
-What is your occupation?
-l am a surgical aide.
Why were you going to Australia?
l was a member of a medical team.
You were born in Berlin?
Yes.
And your parents, also born in Germany?
Yes.
So a German girl on an enemy vessel.
Whatever gave you the absurd idea
l was German?
lf you're not a German, what then?
l am anti-German.
Captain, luck's still with us.
The fog is coming in a lot thicker.
You know the chantey
of blockade-runners out of Tokyo, Bosun?
Nine days out, all will be fair.
Ten days out, sailor, beware.
Yes, sir.
Captain, the steward
has just made a strudel.
Good. l'd love it with a cup of coffee.
l've had the men go over
the engines again.
Cylinder head pressure's normal,
rev's increasing.
You must be getting very bored, Mr. Keil.
l'm sorry we don't have shuffleboard
or a band.
Well, l've been able
to occupy myself, Captain.
l've been studying
the animal life in my bunk...
and the wind and waves.
Well, the wind and the waves
have been very good to us.
They certainly have.
We're nearly a full day ahead of schedule.
Yeah, and the old tub
is still glued together.
So help me,
l'm beginning to get fond of her.
Sir?
A number of ships.
Two different codes, very strong.
Signals are much stronger, sir.
They might be
a city block away in this porridge.
-Kruse.
-Captain.
-Shadow!
-There! Pinned her, too, Captain.
Englishmen.
lmproved D class of Lambert and Holt.
Englishmen...
like ourselves.
Three ships off port bow!
Convoy!
Convoy...
and we're in the middle of it.
What do we do now, sir?
Mr. Kruse...
-Keep parallel to the convoy.
-Yes, sir...
We bluff, young man.
And we believe in miracles.
Captain?
Captain, there's a destroyer...
heading straight for us.
American, Benz-class.
Four guns, 10 torpedo tubes.
Makes 36 knots.
Good. Send them a citation.
Captain, it's a matter of minutes.
Mr. Kruse, sound the general alarm.
Don't sound the horn.
He may be on routine sub patrol
and bear off.
All men to stations
except radio, engine room, and bridge.
Sir, radio message received.
Destroyer wants identification.
Tell Mr. Nissen to send,
"British Stonehenge in convoy.''
-And send it slowly and garbled.
-Garbled, sir?
Mr. Nissen knows
the meaning of the word.
-Now move!
-Yes, sir.
And somebody bring me a cigar.
General alarm !
General alarm ! Don't use the horn!
They are bound to see
we are a fake pretty soon.
We'll be sent to a prisoners-of-war camp,
maybe in Hawaii in the sun.
Come on, darling, take us.
Come, take us, darling. Come on.
Donkeyman, what are you waiting for?
Let's go.
First, l've got a piece of business
to take care of.
Eight hundred yards.
Seven hundred.
Six hundred.
Five hundred yards.
Three hundred fifty.
He's changing course.
He's bearing off.
We are getting away with it.
They think we are real.
l don't know what they think,
but it's time somebody lit my cigar.
You there! Hoffman!
Get off the deck and kill the whistle!
Captain, the destroyer has ordered us
to stop immediately for boarding.
Here, sir.
-Mr. Kruse, halt engines.
-Halt engines, sir.
-Halt engines.
-Halt engines.
Engines halting.
Abandon ship.
Abandon ship.
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
lnto the boats!
-Are we scuttling, sir?
-Get on. l'll take care of it.
Get in the boats, men!
And hurry up there! Hurry up!
Hold the line!
Capt. Mueller, wait!
Why aren't you in the lifeboat?
Don't throw your life away needlessly.
You're insane.
l'll be over the side as soon as l finish this.
Mr. Kruse, hold the lifeboats.
Everybody, back to stations!
Sir! Sir!
Mr. Branner reports engine room ready.
Full ahead.
Give me everything you can deliver.
-Hard to starboard.
-Hard to starboard.
We'll make for that fog bank.
Maybe we can sneak out of here.
Helmsman, what's your reading?
One, one, zero, sir.
Port two points.
-Port two points, sir.
-Mr. Milkereit? Mr. Kruse?
-Sir.
-Radical change of course.
-Which alternative, sir?
-Put us on course beta.
Yes, sir.
-Mr. Cornelson?
-Yes, sir.
They'll send our description
to every skiff between here and Midway.
Call Bosun to my quarters.
We change camouflage again.
Yes, sir.
-Mr. Keil?
-Yes.
l have misjudged you, Mr. Keil.
l never for one moment thought that...
you might try to save my life.
You gentlemen of the SS don't usually
display the humanity of a sand crab.
Well, to be honest with you,
l couldn't help myself.
Well, gentlemen, was it God
or the Föhrer that brought the fog?
Thank both, and the captain as well.
-l must say, he used his wits.
-Yeah, he was brilliant.
Yeah.
Milkereit, in which direction
are we headed?
Sorry, our course is classified.
Don't you think that perhaps by now
l am an exception to the general rules?
-As navigation officer, l can't allow that--
-Just for once, use a little common sense.
lt's your responsibility, sir.
Mr. Keil...
-this is our present position.
-Yeah.
This was the old course, almost due east.
Now this will be our new course. See?
Yeah.
-ls that coffee over there?
-Yeah.
-Can l have a cup please?
-Of course.
Thank you.
-Do you take sugar?
-One teaspoon full.
-Here's your coffee.
-Oh. Thank you, very kind.
-Yeah, now, this is the new course.
-This is the new course. Yeah.
-But we lose a lot of time this way--
-Oh, yeah, several days.
-You must have dropped your pin.
-No, no.
l never can measure distance on the map.
l was trying to find out
how far it is from here to here.
That's very easy.
Just a moment, from here to here.
lt's 220 miles.
You know, it's strange.
lt's only about two inches, and yet it's...
-further than Leipzig to Dösseldorf?
-Yeah, you're right.
This island, it's not....
-lt's not dangerous to go so close?
-No, it's uninhabited.
lt's no tactical value for us
or the Americans.
lt has such a strange shape.
lt's like a starfish.
-What are you laughing for?
-That's its name. Starfish lsland.
Yeah, l guess.
This is certainly interesting. l've never...
seen it before.
Kruse, would you excuse me, please?
-l'll see you a bit later.
-Sure, sure. Thank you.
Standard Leader?
Standard Leader.
All right.
Shall we go to my room?
Mine's right here.
Your swindle is over.
What swindle?
lt's damn plain that you don't want
this ship to reach Bordeaux.
What do you want of me?
We want to hear what you've got to offer.
And if we don't like it...
we turn this over to Kruse or the captain.
Milkereit.
-How many are there of you?
-We have four others.
-Four. And there are no officers?
-No.
How long have you been together
with these men?
We started to talk during the camouflage.
And then l saw you jam the whistle...
and realized you also were in the fight
against Hitler.
l see l am surrounded by patriots.
Not these others.
lf they reach Germany,
they will be finished.
Yeah, l think you will be finished also.
Yes, l know.
l keep wondering if that's why
l was assigned here on this ship.
We all have the same goal,
to keep our heads on our shoulders.
Every time we bump into each other,
it's near a scuttling charge. Am l right?
Yeah, l was trying to disarm them.
-What's your plan?
-Now there's no plan.
Before we changed course, we were
headed straight for an Allied ambush.
An ambush?
Yeah, there were American warships
waiting for us, but now it's finished.
-What is your plan?
-We haven't any plan.
There's only one chance then.
This island, Star something.
-Starfish lsland?
-Starfish lsland. How far is it?
About 3,000 miles.
How many days?
Roughly 15 days.
Fifteen.
How close do we come to it
when we pass?
About 70 or 80 miles.
Milkereit!
-Milkereit!
-Just a second, sir.
Excuse me, sir, l was just lying down.
That's all right.
Milkereit, what l need is a report
of all the winds and currents...
of the new course beta.
-As soon as possible.
-Yes, l will do it.
-Okay?
-Yes.
Would it be possible...
when we pass this island...
to take one of those rubber boats
and put it over the side?
-lf it's night.
-And nobody sees us.
The chances of making the island
would still be 15-to-1 .
We must take whatever chance we have.
Now, there are three scuttling charges
that l have not yet disarmed.
l will continue to disarm the charges...
in the events that we are intercepted
by an Allied warship.
Now, are we all agreed?
Yes, we do.
Stop engines. Slow us down.
Stop engines. Slow us down, sir.
-Lower the gangplank.
-Lower the gangplank, sir.
-Lower the gangplank!
-All you men here...
lower the gangway.
Hurry up! Get it over with!
We'll continue to observe radio silence
until after transfer of prisoners.
-What transfer of prisoners?
-Shall l send a reply, sir?
Yes. Tell them Capt. Mueller
just jumped overboard.
-Did you disarm it?
-Yeah, there are only two left.
Welcome aboard the steam ship Christina.
Thank you, Captain.
lt's always nice to meet
an honest Swedish skipper.
You must enjoy being a neutral.
You're lit up like a Christmas tree.
Well, l'm glad l'm no longer English.
You came within 100 yards
of putting a torpedo in my belly.
And your destroyers almost put
a depth charge down my throat.
-Back to stations.
-Back to stations, sir.
Back to stations! Everybody!
l can certainly see why you were
so obstinate back in Japan.
l now hand you custody of 15 prisoners.
lnterrogation report on each.
As well as one on the girl.
Nothing is spared me.
You will find that one very interesting.
-Mr. Kruse?
-Captain.
Escort the prisoners
to twin decks number five.
Yes, sir. Move!
Just a minute.
Mr. Cornelson, you certainly wouldn't
put her up with them.
Mr. Cornelson, take her to my cabin
for the time being.
Now, Adm. Wendel--
l know. l know.
This new cargo is a burden, Captain.
l suppose that's why
you radioed the request...
but not the reason for this rendezvous.
Were you afraid
l might get a bit too obstinate this time?
We thought of that Mueller,
we thought of that.
Now that you're here,
would you join me for a drink?
Fine.
l wouldn't have missed this chance
to congratulate you personally.
Slipping in and out of that convoy.
Remarkable seamanship.
Thank you.
Very gratifying for a captain
who has to have a keeper on his tail.
Keeper?
lnsist on playing games? Very well.
The passenger you gentlemen put aboard.
Someone we put aboard?
HeiI Hitler.
-HeiI Hitler.
-HeiI Hitler.
Adm. Wendel, Cmdr. Busch...
this is my passenger, Mr. Hans Keil
of the Security Office.
Adm. Wendel, it's a pleasure to meet you.
l am delighted, Mr. Keil,
to meet you here.
Thank you.
Glad to meet you.
Your department didn't notify me
of your assignment.
Oh, that's strange.
l presented my credentials
to the embassy.
Naturally. Well, then, your venture
was authorized after l left Tokyo.
Yeah, perhaps.
Anyway, this is not a venture.
l'm just here as a passenger.
-Please, sit down.
-Thank you.
Where were you before Tokyo?
l'm not able to reveal this.
Secret information, no doubt.
Classified.
Gentlemen.
l'll wager one thing.
When you left port...
you didn't expect to run into
two officers from the German Admiralty.
Never hoped for such luck.
Well, as my friend
Bernhard Weber used to say...
if you can't imagine a situation it is....
You knew Brigade Leader Weber?
-Weber?
-From SS leadership school.
You went there, of course.
Yeah, sure, class of 1938.
General Ordenlichter
was the commandant then.
Are you acquainted with him?
-Yes.
-He was a wonderful man.
Class of '38.
Well, then you must know
Brigade Leader Weber.
The Chief of Political Evaluation.
Weber. Weber.
Yeah, l remember him.
l see you smoke an English briar.
An amazing observation.
You should be in counter-intelligence.
l am.
-Really?
-And frankly...
what we would like to determine is...
what you're doing onboard this ship.
Nothing more important than...
being a passenger.
But l'm so flattered with your interest.
Well, l never did finish my remark
about Brigade Leader Weber.
-The Political Evaluation Chief.
-Right.
An astonishing fact is
that he doesn't exist.
l invented the man.
Of course, he doesn't exist.
Gentlemen, l don't wish
to embarrass you...
but really this kind of
interrogation technique is childish.
We learned this in the first two weeks
of leadership school.
But l am fascinated by your curiosity.
You would be less fascinated if l told you
that perhaps you, too, are an invention...
-Standard Leader Keil.
-Now, gentlemen...
if it wasn't for Mr. Keil,
we wouldn't be aboard this ship.
He stopped me from scuttling her.
l had my hand on the switch...
and Mr. Keil thought
that l was going to stay with her...
and did his best to stop me.
And while he was doing that,
your wolf-pack...
blasted the convoy.
So, you see, if he hadn't delayed me
for a few seconds...
would have been at the bottom of the sea.
So Mr. Keil is capable
of a nice, sentimental gesture.
-That doesn't clear up my doubts.
-l see no reasons...
to discuss matters that concern
only my department.
And now, Adm. Wendel,
let me notify you in very simple terms.
The Security Office will be informed
in every exact detail...
as to your interference, is that clear?
-Mr. Keil, l will not permit you--
-Now, gentlemen.
There is no real problem.
All you have to do is radio Berlin.
Yeah, excellent idea.
This is logical.
Capt. Mueller, are you willing
to be answerable for Mr. Keil?
Yes.
l'll accept that.
l don't think we need trouble Berlin.
l realize that we have offended you.
But you must understand
our need for caution.
lf l didn't, who would?
At any rate, my regrets.
Adm. Wendel.
And thank you
for your excellent hospitality.
Good night, Mr. Keil.
Naturally, l'll radio Berlin.
By this time tomorrow,
you should have a complete report.
Meantime, keep an eye on him.
Capt. Mueller, thank you for your gesture.
lt was very kind.
You gentlemen wouldn't trust
your own embalmer.
Enjoy your next 24 hours.
They may be your last ones.
They're checking with Berlin.
Did the officer who brought you here
ask your name?
-No.
-Good.
You must promise
to keep your mouth shut.
Keep my mouth shut about what?
About the fact that you're....
A Jewess?
ls it so difficult to say the word?
l have nothing against you
because you are Jewish.
One can't choose one's parents.
-ls that what you mean?
-No, that is not what l mean.
Sit down.
Sit down!
That's my son.
He'd like you.
On the other hand, he might prefer
to lop off my head.
Why do you resent being treated
with respect?
Let's see. Your name: ''Esther Levy.''
Levy won't do. What shall we call you?
Cohen? Shapiro?
Look, there's a long trip ahead.
Put a lid on your pride.
lt's worth it to make yourself comfortable.
And let you feel decent.
lf you wish.
Then lend me a needle and thread.
l'd like to make this outfit
a little more attractive...
for the concentration camp.
When we reach Bordeaux...
this report will be lost.
And with luck...
perhaps you may find a way
to lose yourself there, too.
l'm sorry. lt's the most l can do.
Do you want to sleep with me?
Or you're just doing this
because you're kindhearted?
Young lady, even this kind
of impudence will not stop me...
from treating you simply
as another member of the human race.
All right.
ln America, l lived
with a family named Goddard.
Milkereit, since you are on the bridge,
you can take the captain by surprise.
-Alone?
-No, Boeck will be with you.
Donkeyman, you and Hoffman
will overpower the guard on the rear deck.
But how do we get
those prisoners with us?
Well, l will have to find a way
to speak with them as soon as possible.
l would first like to consider
all the risks before making--
There is nothing to consider.
Consider how your face will look
with a piano wire around your neck...
when Kruse sends his report
into the Gestapo.
But without those prisoners,
we have no chance.
Not even with them.
lf we take over the ship, we are only
two days away from the American navy.
You know what looks
very good to me now?
Starfish lsland.
Donkeyman...
you said the odds against
this island were...
what, 15-to-1?
What are they against this plan?
We must make a decision.
Yes.
Let's go.
Miss Goddard, this is...
Standard Leader Keil.
How do you do?
Miss Goddard is an American girl.
She studied in Germany.
Well, we are delighted
to have you with us.
ls it my insignia that disturbs her?
-Captain, where is my room?
-Right here.
lt's obvious that you share
the captain's sentiments about the SS.
As l told Capt. Mueller,
it was a long voyage.
Yes.
Chess partners are very difficult
to come by Mr. Keil.
Evidently.
Miss Goddard?
-Miss Goddard?
-Who is it?
lt's Mr. Keil.
Could l speak with you one moment?
There is a crack under the door.
lt should be easy
for you to crawl through it.
At 7:00 every morning,
an officer and two crew members...
will supervise the prisoners exercise.
After this duty, the weapons
will be locked in the ordinance room.
Now l understand the hatch covers over
the prisoners hold were closed last night.
You must like steam baths.
From now on, the hatch covers
will remain partially open...
and therefore, the regular watch
in the area will be armed.
l acted for our well-being, sir,
not towards the enemy's.
Well, l won't let it spoil my appetite
for breakfast.
l'm glad of that, sir.
There's international rules!
We got a right to be heard.
Shall we arrange it for them?
l would like to be there...
when you try to convince
these birds to join the Gestapo.
Some day it will be a pleasure
to pay a visit to America.
-This will be wonderful.
-Meanwhile, let's eat. Thank you.
Keep moving. Let's go.
Keep moving! Call Dr. Ambach.
Take him over to the hospital right away.
You, follow them.
Captain, emergency! A prisoner's hurt.
We can't rouse Dr. Ambach.
Get me the morphine.
lt's bad, but not as bad
as the racket you're making.
-What's the matter?
-There's no morphine here.
l'll get it.
You can be of use. Go up there and help.
You, up here. Us, sweating in a dungeon.
-Your kind always wind up living rich.
-Shut up.
Shut up, you crackpot.
We're sick of hearing that garbage.
What's this? What do you mean?
He means l'm a Jew.
Where do you hide the ship's morphine?
-This damn fever gets me now.
-Where is the morphine, Mr. Ambach?
Morphine? There is no morphine.
No, no, no. lt's mine.
l brought it aboard the ship myself.
lt's mine. This stuff's mine.
lt's private property. No!
You can't have that. Captain!
l'll die without it. l'll die.
You'll live, Mr. Ambach.
They told me voyage to China coast...
only a few days.
They lied to me.
l had to take it. l had to take it.
l had to.
Do you want me to clean it now?
When a Jewish bitch takes over
the sick ward then....
Miss Levy is perfectly able
to attend to this.
Miss Levy?
You knew.
Have you thought of the effect
on the officers and men?
l didn't know it was contagious.
Now, what do you have to say about this?
l think you're out of your mind...
but, after all,
you are the master of the ship.
That l am.
Now, take care of it.
l'm sure you can do it better than l can.
You're saying that she will continue
to have a stage room?
That you will go on feeding her
in the salon?
The lady's privileges will remain.
Now the steward will be glad
to serve your meals in your cabin...
if it's all too much for you.
-l must remind you of the consequences.
-l recognize that word.
lf all Germans had conducted
themselves like this...
-where do you suppose we'd be today?
-Certainly not where we are now.
-You are speaking to a party member.
-This is not a party office.
You had better remember
there's nothing chalked up against me.
-Now don't you carry me--
-Not even an ounce of Jamaican rum.
Now you listen to me!
l've been at sea too long for this.
l know all your talk.
l'll take the responsibility for what l do.
You young men...
who keep the world breathless.
lt's your time, l know.
But to realize your dreams...
you'll need something more than brutality.
You'll need, if you can manage it,
a little mercy.
Now, what could you know of our dreams?
l'm all right now. Thanks.
l'm not going to hurt you.
l'm not going to hurt you. Listen.
Just listen and be quiet.
lf you scream,
you will only place your life in danger.
Now, understand that l'm not an SS man.
l am a German,
working for the British lntelligence...
and l am planning to take over this ship.
Now, l am going to take my hands away
from your mouth...
and l don't want you to scream.
Don't scream.
l'm not an SS man.
l'm working for British lntelligence.
l'm planning to take over this ship.
l don't believe you.
You have no choice.
You are a Jew on your way to Germany.
And if you value your life,
you will need my help...
and l will need yours.
How can l be of help to you?
Well, l cannot take over this ship
without the American prisoners...
and l may need your help to contact them.
Why don't you contact them yourself?
l am going to try.
But the message exposing me
is on its way from Berlin.
And if it comes by 8:00 tonight,
when the watch changes...
then you will have to slip into the hold
and persuade them.
They will not believe
any of the men with me.
And if our plan succeeds, we'll be finished
with this idiotic war in a few days.
You think this war is idiotic?
All wars are idiotic.
One is not different from the other.
Then why are you here?
Certainly not by choice.
l was blackmailed by a Britisher
to the strains of Mozart.
l am not concerned about this war.
l don't care who wins or loses.
But l am concerned about the Gestapo.
You have no idea
what these people are capable of.
Like....
Like maybe force me to have sex
with my brother?
Or something like that?
And maybe kill Bernie
if he's not able to have sex with me?
And, then, maybe make me sleep
with all of them...
all 17 of them, hour after hour.
Quiet. Quiet.
Be still.
While you were listening to your Mozart...
my mother and my father were marched...
to the gas chamber
where they were killed.
You want to tell me about the Gestapo?
Get out! Get out!
Be quiet.
-Get out!
-Quiet!
HeIIo, Midshipman EmiI Brinkmann...
your father, GeneraI Franz Brinkmann,
awarded the Knight's Cross with swords.
Engineer Mark Leicht,
we hope you are Iistening.
Your brother, Major Martin Leicht
awarded the Knight's Cross...
after a daring bombing mission
over Rostov on the Russian front.
HeIIo, Capt. RoIf MueIIer,
on duty in the Far East...
your son, Lt. KarI MueIIer...
commanding a motor torpedo boat
off the French coast...
having sunk his fifth ship
in the Iast three months...
the Iatest, a soIo dayIight attack
which sank the British vesseI Carapace...
awarded the Knight's Cross.
-Wonderful.
-Congratulations, sir.
This is a great moment.
lt's only fitting to say, sir, that everyone
in your command feels honored.
That's very kind of you, Mr. Kruse.
Thank you.
The Carapace.
Let's see what's her tonnage.
lt must be in the Talbot.
Congratulations, Captain.
lt must be a proud moment.
Thank you, Mr. Keil.
Come in, gentlemen.
Congratulations, Captain.
-Congratulations.
-lt's wonderful.
-Carapace on Page 131, sir.
-To your health, sir.
-Good luck, Captain.
-And to your son.
To your health, sir.
He must be quite a seaman.
HeiI Hitler!
HeiI! HeiI!
Hail the Knight's Cross.
He's a crazy drunk.
HeiI!
-Half the ship can hear you.
-Can they?
Tell me about the consequences.
Tell me the consequences.
Read me the sentence.
What is the worst?
To fight war alongside you!
Milkereit...
you poor fool.
Raised your voice against them.
You don't know about the consequences.
Wouldn't it be wonderful...
if it turned out
you're not an SS man at all?
Oh, they will turn you into one of them...
into a cannibal.
The most wonderful, gentle boy....
HeiI cannibals!
HeiI!
HeiI!
Take your stations. Everybody.
Come with me.
Tell all the officers to assemble
in the salon at once.
Yes, sir.
The point we spoke about.
lt's here, and l need you as a witness.
Now, go on.
Things are falling apart.
Keil can't do it.
l will.
Sure, he is on a spree, but he'll work it off.
l've made this entry in the ship's diary.
''Capt. Mueller is mentally
and physically irresponsible...
''due to alcoholic over-indulgence.''
Dr. Ambach will confirm this.
l wouldn't take coke-head's diagnosis
of a cockroach.
Mr. Branner, Mueller's illness is chronic.
He was drunk
when his last ship was torpedoed.
lt's hard to believe.
Mr. Keil?
Yeah.
lt's unfortunate, but he is correct.
And under the circumstances, l think
we must follow Mr. Kruse.
For the protection of the ship,
l am now taking command.
lnform your men. Dismissed.
Capt. Kruse?
Captain, it's for my health.
Mueller didn't understand this.
l can't live without it.
l'll see you get what you need,
but it won't be morphine.
This one here was caught trying to sneak
into the prisoners' hatch.
Really?
Well, perhaps that's where
she prefers to be.
Take her down in the hold with the others.
Go ahead.
l don't mean to interfere,
but this is disgusting.
Thank you very much
for your help, Mr. Keil.
Yeah.
-Steward?
-Yes, sir.
-l have been told that you are now--
-Correct. Here.
Sew the fourth stripe on the sleeve.
-lt's regulations.
-Yes, sir.
lf this works out...
l want a front row seat
when we nail Kruse to the mast.
-Are the men ready?
-Yes.
They will be.
But suppose the girl can't persuade
those prisoners?
Then l'll have to try to get down there
when the watch changes...
and persuade them myself.
All right, but that will be a while.
Suppose we believe this guy Keil.
What's his plan?
You start a fire down here.
Then you scream your lungs out.
You climb up the ladder,
and when you get to the top...
you yell, run, and scatter.
Are you kidding, lady?
They'll be waiting up there
to shoot us full of holes.
No. The fire will confuse the guards,
and Keil's men will overcome them.
Honey, you can't win a battle
just by yelling. You need guns.
We'll get guns.
Guns, guns.
Where are they gonna get guns?
One of the officers is with us.
He'll attack the captain and take the keys
to the ordnance room.
The whole stunt's cockeyed.
Let them try it alone.
They're outnumbered. lt's nine against 40.
So?
So we join them, huh?
And then it's only 2-to-1 against us.
That's enough.
Let's suppose we make this Keil circle.
We get a cup of coffee
and a first class ticket to the Golden Gate.
-Then what?
-Then we get good and drunk.
Sleep for a month, huh?
Get a bath tub of beer.
We'll see if the girls
are still at Shany's bar.
That's for me. l say aye.
Well, don't be such a hero.
You'll get a kiss and a drink
and two weeks shore leave.
And after that, you'll be back
on the frontlines again.
Swimming in burning oil
and boiling like a mackerel.
l say, let's vote on it. And l'm for it.
-l'm with you.
-Good man. What do you say?
l'll go along, fellas.
-Okay.
-That's it. Come on, huh?
-All right, l'm in.
-Ten, huh?
-Against five.
-Majority rules.
-Yeah.
-The hell it does.
This ain't the Congress.
-Okay, man. Then we'll try it without you.
-The hell you will.
You blow this, and they'll kill us all.
That's not true.
Come on. Do you think those bastards
will string you up...
and serve us ice cream
just because we laid off?
-Listen--
-Start a fire here...
and they'll be damn sure
every one of us is in on it.
He's right.
Look, l'm sorry.
We'd take the chance, you see...
but it'd have to be all of us.
l'd rather take my chances
in a prison camp.
Hell, l'd like to take mine right here.
-You and me both.
-Sure.
Don't look so worried, baby.
We're all nice guys.
Sure.
You kept too much to yourself
on the old BIue DoIphin.
lf you'd spent a little time with us,
you might have had some fun.
And, baby, we've got nothing but time
from now on.
Are you kidding? Get your hands back.
There's one thing you're good for.
Stop it. Break it up.
You can have it if you want it.
And you.
Or you. Join the others.
Make them keep their word.
Make them keep it.
-Mr. Kruse?
-Yeah?
Sir, a radio message from Adm. Wendel.
Wendel?
Thank you.
l'll handle the so-called Mr. Keil.
Milkereit! Milkereit!
Now you will kindly tell me
what this is all about.
l can start a new one now.
You see?
lt's very nice.
Yes. Branner.
Fire! Fire!
Brandt, come with me.
Lutz, you cover them.
Donkeyman, the ordnance room.
Surrender!
All right! All right!
We give up here. Don't shoot.
We are finished.
Come up.
Up. Get in line.
All right.
Let's find the other two. Branner?
Mr. Branner, take the engine room.
Cornelson, the foredeck.
There is a rubber boat.
Midships.
We can heave it over the side
and jump after it.
We'll disappear in two minutes.
Come on.
We can make it.
Why not?
Now l blow up the ship.
Do it.
Anybody seen my bird?
l can't find him.
My baby hates the sound of guns.
Scares the feathers off him.
Where's Keil?
Where's Keil?
Keil?
Where's Keil?
Where's Keil?
He is hiding in the propeller shaft.
Move!
-Take the prisoners below.
-Yes, sir.
Search the lifeboats.
Capt. Mueller?
-So Adm. Wendel was right.
-Yeah.
But there is no time for this.
Why not?
-Your mutiny has failed.
-Not yet.
You once said that...
the worst consequence would be
to have to fight...
alongside men like Kruse.
There is another way.
There is a rendezvous point where
American warships are waiting for us...
at 14 degrees North, 175 degrees East.
You have a choice.
Whatever else l am, l'm not a traitor.
Neither was your son.
Get out. Get out.
Yeah, l will.
There! On the bridge!
Out! Get out!
Move!
No.
Mr. Keil, please, don't.
The engine room is torn to pieces.
She's flooding.
Abandon ship.
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Here.
Over here.
But, sir, please--
Now l am where l belong.
l intend to stay here.
Now over the side, all of you.
-Captain.
-Do as l say.
Mr. Kruse!
Over here!
Over here!
Here.
Come on, Mr. Kruse.
Over here.
Capt. Mueller.
Mr. Keil?
You won't need that raft for a while.
But what is it?
What's happened?
Well...
the lard. lt solidified.
Plugged up the hole.
How much longer will we remain afloat?
Well, it's lasted two hours.
Maybe another two, maybe 10...
unless we break up first.
Ten hours.
ln what direction are we drifting?
We couldn't drift that far in days.
lt would take a warship going full ahead
a good six or seven hours.
Capt. Mueller...
l don't suppose you would consider
sending a radio message for me?
You're not very subtle, Mr. Keil.
But l must admire your courage.
You're the one with courage, Mueller.
lt takes real courage...
to see your son
turn into a merciless fanatic...
and still believe in your mildewed
concepts of the fatherland.
l envy you.
l wish l had so much to believe in.
lf you have nothing to believe in,
why did you blow up the ship?
That doesn't matter now.
