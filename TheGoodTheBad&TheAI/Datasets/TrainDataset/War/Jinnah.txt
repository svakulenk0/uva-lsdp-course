Miss Jinnah.
Doctor.
Steady flight?
- Why have we stopped?
- Engine.
We can fix it.
It's out of petrol. It was spluttering.
- No, no, I'm sure it's engine failure.
- Let's use the car.
No. Absolutely not.
You can't move him.
- Colonel Knowles, fetch some petrol.
- Get another ambulance.
Let's go.
Doctor, quickly.
Oh... just put those things
over there... and clear off.
Look, I'm quite happy with pen and paper.
I do not want... Oh...
Jinnah Sahab.
Assalamualaikum.
- Walaikumasalam.
-  Forgive me.
I thought you were one of these
wretched computer wallahs.
They keep sending these
damned machines in from the future.
-
- Excuse me.
Yes?
No. No, no, no.
No appeal. Tell him to go to hell.
You do know where you are...
I have a vague idea.
You've stopped here
so we may decide where to send you.
With all due respect sir, may I know
how you arrive at these decisions?
Ah...
Here. We have everything here.
We've been expecting you.
What...
Oh, no.
They've transferred
every detail of your life
into these wretched computers.
No one here knows how to use them.
And the manuals are written in
God knows what language.
Your file's gone.
As it is, we're overworked.
We've had lots of trouble
with your century.
World wars, revolutions, communism,
capitalism, fascism,
this ism and that ism.
Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao Tse-tung.
Mr Harry Truman and his nuclear bomb.
Yes...
We've had a very busy time here.
And where did you send them?
I can't even remember.
The problem you fellows pose
is desperate.
You create Pakistan...
and millions die
in the division of what was one country
into two pieces.
There was no other way. None.
Maybe. Maybe.
Please, follow me, Mr Jinnah.
I did everything I could
to stop the slaughter.
I fought for Pakistan.
So that 100 million people
could live in safety and dignity.
I've got an hour and a half
to prepare your case.
What are the charges?
They accuse you of being ambitious,
arrogant, humourless, stubborn.
A man without charm, a bully.
They say you used people.
I had no ambition. Except for
the safety of the Muslims of India.
I had no stubbornness or arrogance,
except that which was required of me,
to face my enemies.
And I died a million deaths, myself,
for all those who suffered
through Partition.
No, Jinnah Sahab, just the facts.
Facts? What facts?
You've lost the books.
You don't understand the machines.
Oh... I see what you mean.
Well...
There is, of course,
the eternal shortcut.
'At Harrow, we got into the habit
of calling everyone 'sir'.
'I called my father 'sir'.'
I called my mother 'sir'. Everyone.
It's a great British tradition.
When in doubt, call them 'sir'.
I'll suggest it to Dickie.
He only calls you Panditji
to annoy Jinnah.
It's difficult, isn't it?
And what do we call Gandhi?
Mahatma. Bapu...
Gandhiji... Mr Gandhi.
He has more names than a character
in a Russian novel.
Perhaps it's best to behave
like a good Indian wife.
They don't call their husbands anything.
Just nudge 'em.
And what do you think
of Western civilisation, Mr Nehru?
'Oh, I think it would be
an excellent idea.'
That's private!
You're not happy, are you,
Jawaharlal?
You want the British... us...
to go, but you don't want
the bond to be broken.
What the British have left us
will last a long time.
- In people like you?
- Oh, I'm proud of it.
Did Mr Jinnah
go to Oxford or Cambridge?
No, he didn't.
Er, but he was called to the bar
in London.
And I'm told he even did
a stint as Romeo on a London stage.
"It was not the lark
but the nightingale
"who..."
"...who..."
Who forgot the rest.
Oh, Jawaharlal, you're lying.
He never played Shakespeare.
No, it's true!
It's funny. He seemed so proper
when we first met him in Delhi.
His propriety doesn't bother us.
His stubbornness, vaingloriousness...
Wait till the discussions begin.
Dickie's in for a surprise.
I know he thinks
he's the Great Persuader.
Jinnah is the Great Unpersuadable.
The Great Unpersuadable?
Divide the country in two?
Muslims on one side,
Hindus on the other?
Mr Jinnah...
that is madness.
Lord Mountbatten...
It would be equally insane
to leave a Muslim minority
at the mercy of a Hindu majority,
many of whom hate us.
- Now, if the English parliament...
- The prime minister...
has given me full powers.
I decide.
That's why I'm here.
As representative of the King Emperor.
Whom we respect.
And I am here a representative
of a Muslim nation,
whom you must learn to respect.
-  Pakistan!
-  Zindabad!
-  Pakistan!
-  Zindabad!
-  Pakistan!
-  Zindabad!
-  Quaid-e-Azam!
- Zindabad!
-  Pakistan!
-  Zindabad!
-  Quaid-e-Azam!
- Zindabad!
-  Pakistan!
-  Zindabad!
-  Quaid-e-Azam!
- Zindabad!
Mr Jinnah, what did Lord Mountbatten
think of the Pakistan demand?
I suggest you ask him.
I do not speak for the King Emperor.
Jinnah Sahab.
We were told that you are... humourless.
Oh, really?
It's that fellow again.
He's a member of the Congress Party.
Because I don't laugh at his jokes,
he goes around spreading this rumour.
You call yourself Muslim and you parade
your respected sister in front of crowds,
shamelessly?
Islam stands for equality
for men and women, Maulana Sahab.
And the women in the family of
the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him,
were active in public life.
Oh, no. They've followed me here.
Bloody fools!
Your Ladyship. Mr Nehru, sir.
His Excellency has asked me to...
Porrit, I said I didn't need...
His Excellency's orders, milady.
So...
- Dickie knows where you are.
- No, Jawaharlal.
Dickie knows where we are.
- Goodbye, Mr Nehru.
- Lady Mountbatten.
- How many were hurt?
- Eight people badly burnt.
We had a feast prepared for Eid, miss.
The Hindus rushed in,
with stones and sticks,
shouting:
"Kill the cow murderers!"
The residents
of this settlement
will move out of this area.
My orders are from local magistrate.
These people need your protection.
And who are you?
They have sent Hindu policemen.
- These are illegal squatters.
- We have lived here 20 years.
Encroached on the land.
You politicians better get out.
- Sir, do you know who...?
- It doesn't matter who I am.
These people are not moving until you
escort them to a proper relief camp.
Arrest these people.
My apologies again, Miss Jinnah.
I assure you we have evacuated
the whole neighbourhood
to temporary accommodation
in army barracks.
Yes, thank you.
My apologies again.
Arresting Miss Jinnah.
You damn fool!
Allahu Akbar.
Nowhere is safe.
It's even worse in the Punjab.
The Bihar Muslim League is reporting
countless incidents of arson
and murder,
against Muslim communities.
And the police here just turn their backs.
All over the country, Hindu officers
have taken charge of the police forces...
-
- Are you all right?
Yes, I think the fever's going.
That poor girl.
She gave up her life for you.
Fatima, my little sister?
She was everything to me.
She should've been married, and found
happiness with a husband and children.
In some decent family.
She was my companion,
my friend,
and my guide.
And she believed in Pakistan.
Were you ever jealous of Nehruji?
His good looks, his wit, his charm,
his English manners.
He was my political opponent.
I respected him,
though I never really trusted him.
- And Gandhiji?
- Another worthy opponent.
But he would never lie.
Though, as a politician,
he would not always tell the truth.
Gandhiji, will you meet with Mr Jinnah
in Simla?
It is always a pleasure to meet Mr Jinnah.
Mr Gandhi, Mr Gandhi.
Are we near the end?
I would prefer to say
close to a new beginning, my son.
Ah...
- Gandhiji.
- Viceroy.
I feel like the mother in
the "Judgement of Solomon".
Give the child to the other woman,
but don't cut it in two.
Together, we must make one last effort
to keep this great nation as one.
Muslims and Hindus
in one free country.
Gandhiji, I'm willing to try.
Years ago, Viceroy,
Mr Jinnah was the greatest advocate
of Hindu-Muslim unity.
Was he, indeed?
Well, then, what changed him?
- Blind ambition.
-  No, no.
The feeling that Muslims
would have no voice... perhaps.
Gandhiji, if you were in my position,
what would you say to Jinnah?
I would say, "Mr Jinnah,
"India must stay united.
"You be its first prime minister
and choose your cabinet."
And tell him that Congress agrees.
They suggested it.
But, Babu...
what are you saying?
Our party would never agree.
Jawaharlal, you mean
you would never agree?
For the unity of India?
Well, yes, but...
Making Jinnah, from
a minority Muslim party, prime minister?
We would ensure, of course,
that you would be deputy prime minister.
But our party...
But if Gandhiji and you
and Sardar Patel declare in favour,
who is to say no?
Except, of course, Jinnah.
You think he'll agree?
Why would he not?
All right, Bapuji. What would he say?
If I told him that Gandhi made the offer?
He would say: "Wily old Gandhi!"
- Letter for Jinnah Sahab.
-Thank you.
Dinner. Lady Mountbatten. Tomorrow.
You can't offer it to Jinnah.
The country won't accept it.
- We've never even put him in jail.
- I could start now.
Nehru's been in for years,
defying the British.
Jinnah does it more subtly.
I'd no idea Gandhiji was so cynical.
It'll never work.
What you mean is,
what will our Jawaharlal do?
He has to be prime minister, doesn't' he?
Yes.
'He's the great rising star
in our firmament. A man of destiny.
'But will it make sense
to give it to Jinnah?
'Gandhiji didn't mean it.
Yes, he does. And it's a great plan.
Give Jinnah the biggest responsibility
in an undivided nation,
what can he do?
He has to appoint a majority congress
to a cabinet.
I've seen it before. Make
the biggest bounder the head prefect.
The country'll never forgive you.
You mean,
Jawaharlal will never forgive you.
Or you.
And you couldn't live with that.
Dickie, it isn't only me.
You're in love with power.
And Jawaharlal is the embodiment of it.
So... what will you do?
I don't know.
But I'm tempted.
If these Indian politicians carry on
like this, I'll foist Jinnah on them.
It's what they deserve.
A sour, spoilt barrack-room lawyer.
Gurdip Singh.
Not very dignified.
'Of course,
I was in love with India.'
I saved it from the Japs.
Edwina will tell you,
we longed to come back.
You can imagine how I felt.
The King called me and said:
"Go to India. Give it all away."
Can you give away
what never really belonged to you?
You're right. We don't own it.
We hold it in trust.
My predecessor, Wavell,
told me a funny story.
When he first landed in India,
the crowds greeted him with
"Pakistan Zindabad! Pakistan Zindabad!"
He knew even less Urdu than I do.
So he turned to his aide and said,
"What are they saying?"
Whereupon, quick as a flash,
the aide translates:
"Oh, they're saying,
'Pakistan's in the bag!"'
You see? "Zindabad". "In the bag".
- Ha-ha-ha.
-
With all the tension in the country,
I don't think we have
a great deal to laugh about.
Perhaps not.
These are, by any measure,
difficult times,
with difficult decisions ahead.
May I take this informal occasion
to make a very serious proposal?
Dickie... should the ladies withdraw?
No. Stay.
Suppose, Mr Jinnah,
I were to say to you,
let's have a united India,
with a democratic constitution,
and the first prime minister of India,
completely free
to choose his own cabinet,
would be Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
What would you say?
The Hindus, the Congress Party,
would never agree.
Suppose I tell you they have?
It was, in fact, Gandhi's idea.
Wily old Gandhi.
- Well?
- Well, Viceroy, it's a clever ruse.
- Give a dog a bone...
- No, no.
Let us say that Mr Jinnah
is the best man for the job.
And the best choice available.
Do you expect me to be flattered?
Perhaps even to accept?
The brutal truth, Lord Mountbatten,
is that the Hindus
have three votes to our one.
You think they will accept that?
Democracy. One man, one vote,
without any safeguards,
will turn the Muslims
into frightened, insecure,
second-class citizens.
With our religion, our culture,
our language, our very lives
under threat.
We can discuss building in
some safeguards. Assurances.
What assurances, Lord Mountbatten?
Why do you want to force
reluctant partners into a marriage?
Our customs, our food. We can't
even drink out of the same glass.
You don't yet understand
why we want to create Pakistan.
Both communities have suffered,
Mr Jinnah.
Yes, they have.
And they must be separated.
Why didn't you accept it?
Folly of the highest degree.
You could've saved millions of lives.
Millions of homes. There would've been
none of this misery.
You think I took this decision lightly?
Here I was,
being offered the prime-ministership
of the largest new free nation on Earth,
and I turned it down.
Because it wouldn't work.
You should've stayed in Simla.
And in bed. You can't
play fast and loose with bronchitis.
Not even if a country is at stake?
There will be no country without you,
Jinnah Sahab.
It's not bronchitis.
No.
It's consumption, isn't it?
Yes.
Leading to deterioration.
And death.
Yes.
Doctor...
we must keep this between ourselves.
Think of the potential consequences.
I've never lied to him before, Doctor.
And now I have to pretend
that I don't know.
You must get him to rest.
Fatima, were you jealous of Ruttie?
No.
Of course I wasn't jealous of her.
That pretty creature.
So stunningly pretty and young.
- 'Young enough to be your daughter.'
-
But she didn't look after you,
did she?
She wasn't interested in the same things.
And she could never look down
the long road of your destiny.
As I can.
- I'll race you back.
- You'll lose again.
A great setting for the beginning of love.
Yes, it was.
And then love faded away?
Mine never did.
Mm. I can see that you'd run away
from the gates of heaven
to catch a last glimpse of her.
'Being neither Hindu nor Muslim,'
we Parsees can only benefit if
the two main communities stop fighting.
I agree, sir. And share their culture
and their... Indian-ness.
Jinnah, dear boy.
You are young and idealistic.
The only solution is the closest contact.
Interracial marriage.
Then the children will be neither
Hindu nor Muslim,
and these differences will fall away.
So, Hindu-Muslim marriage
would be beneficial?
Most certainly.
And what, sir, do you think
of intermarriage between a Parsee girl
and a Muslim man?
If their status were compatible?
Mr Jinnah. How dare you, sir!
You have abused my hospitality.
I will remind you that my daughter is 16.
A mere child.
Sir, I deny any such intention.
But I apologise for any offence
I may have caused...
and will relieve you
of the feeling...
that your generous hospitality...
has been abused.
You may retire.
I shall see you in the library,
after dinner.
And you will never see that man again!
...Muslim, 24 years old, medically fit.
More like a Kashmiri to me.
We'll take him anyway.
Mr President. Good morning, sir.
I trust you are well.
We have come to join the British Army.
Mr Jinnah.
I warn you that any interruption, here,
of recruitment,
will be seen as a riotous disturbance.
No need for your threats, sir.
As Indians, we simply demand
that we be recruited to the King's service.
As fully commissioned officers.
This form of exhibition
will get you nowhere.
If Indians are being asked
to shed their blood for the Empire,
then why can't we be given the dignity
of joining the army at all levels?
Or are we just cannon fodder?
I declare the proceedings for today
to be over.
Your reply, sir!
Mr Jinnah!
I'm 18 today.
I've left home.
In the name of God,
the Most Gracious, the Most merciful.
Repeat the kalma after me.
There is no God but Allah
and Muhammad is his prophet.
There is no God but Allah
and Muhammad is his prophet.
Our beloved daughter Rattanbai,
we welcome you
to the faith of Islam.
Now, daughter,
do you accept this man,
Muhammad Ali Jinnah,
to be your lawful husband
in the sight of God?
I accept, I accept, I accept.
Mr and Mrs Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
Delighted, Mr Jinnah. Delighted.
- Mr Jinnah.
- And Mrs Jinnah.
I must confess,
your reputation as Bombay's beauty,
is not exaggerated.
Yes, indeed. You and Mr Jinnah
deserve to delight in it.
Thank you.
I'd rather be known as
the strongest nationalist in Bombay.
I thought we'd put politics behind us,
this evening, Mrs Jinnah.
We are so pleased
you were able to join us.
You live above us, don't you,
Mr Jinnah? Atop the hill.
Yes.
With a view of the Arabian Sea.
The same vast expanse
we see from our Karachi house.
Oh, how lucky.
We've never been to Karachi.
And the weather there...
Changeable?
I was... saying to Mrs Jinnah,
the weather in Bombay
is quite changeable.
Would you bring Mrs Jinnah a shawl?
We never think of heating the house.
You must be feeling quite chilly, my dear.
When Mrs Jinnah feels the cold,
she will ask for a wrap herself.
Spare yourself the trouble.
I won't stand in their way.
Let them go.
How dare she dress like that
at my table!
I don't believe Mr Jinnah
will go very far, with that attitude.
We must make two pledges.
The first...
The first is that we stand united,
Hindus and Muslims,
for an India
free from imperial British rule.
The second is that we must act
in a constitutional way.
- We place our just...
-
We place our just demands.
Because only in this way...
...by treading the path of dignity...
...can we take our place as Free India,
among the civilised and great nations.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I move the motion.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Mr Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.
I am very happy to be with you today.
I am even happier to see that you have,
as your chief spokesman,
of Hindu-Muslim unity,
the distinguished Mr Jinnah,
from the Minority Community.
I wish to lend my support
to everything Mr Jinnah says.
He said we must act
in a constitutional way.
He means we must play by the rules.
We can only play by the rules
if we are included in the game.
I welcome the fact
that Mr Jinnah speaks of dignity.
India has an ancient, unshakeable dignity
and an ancient spirit.
A force of spiritual strength
which has been suppressed for too long.
But when it is released,
this shining light of truth
of ahimsa, which is non-violence,
and satyagraha,
which is the ancient path of truth...
no force on Earth,
no constitutional gain,
will be able to suppress it.
- Fine speech, Jin.
-Thank you.
Your Mr Gandhi
is very patronising.
As though you were the newcomer
and he'd worked to build the Congress
Party, instead of the other way round.
Oh, I don't care about that.
There is something about
what Mr Gandhi says...
That makes me a little uneasy.
I wish you'd stay for a few more weeks,
Fatima.
My other brothers need me in Karachi.
But I'll be back soon.
I hope you haven't forgotten anything.
- I don't trust these servants.
- Oh, don't be silly.
Ram has been looking after me
ever since I was a little girl.
Ram, please look after her.
She's so young.
Don't worry, Bibisahiba. Don't' worry.
But...
when you will return from Karachi?
As soon as I'm needed, Ram.
Where are you going, Jin?
Just for a stroll, my love.
Do you want me to come?
Good afternoon, young man.
I hope you don't mind me resting,
for a few moments, in your lovely garden.
Oh, no. No, of course not, sir.
Can I ask them to fetch some water?
No, no, no. I'm not unwell. It's just
the climb up the hill is a little tiring.
- You're most welcome.
- Thank you.
Mr Jinnah.
You are right to trust logic,
but isn't there some logic
in Gandhi's non-violence?
What do you mean?
Who are you?
Just a traveller.
Gandhi angers you.
- Because he patronises you?
- No, no.
No, I'm not a child.
Mr Gandhi is an extraordinary man.
A man who believes in his own mission.
But...
...the clothes...
this imitation of the Hindu peasants,
the... the spinning wheels, the fasts,
the bits and pieces
of Sanskrit philosophy.
Ahimsa, satyagraha...
He is calling forth a flood.
Isn't that what the movement needs?
Millions of people demanding
that the British leave India.
Yes. But will it stop there?
What else will they demand?
When you talk of spirit,
you release darker forces.
Powers that can't be questioned.
illogical urges and anger.
If they succeed in kicking out the British
because they have usurped power in India,
won't their attention,
then, turn to the Muslims?
After all,
we Muslims conquered India
long before the British.
Isn't that logical too?
No. Because we are not outsiders.
We are part of this country.
And besides...
we have no England to go back to.
Jin?
- Talking to yourself, Jin?
- I'm just rehearsing a speech.
Perhaps I should ask
for a postponement of the trial.
Jin...
I don't want you take this amiss...
but I'd like to discuss
something personal with you.
Kanji, I have three cases pending
in the High Court. Can't it wait?
Clear the roadway!
Ruttie!
What the hell are you doing?
Why have you brought Dina here?
Jin, stop them.
They're beating helpless people!
They offer themselves to be beaten.
- Gandhi's politics...
- They're breaking their heads!
There is nothing I can do.
They want these histrionics, this theatre.
You can't just stand there and watch.
Kanji, come on.
Ruttie, get the child home.
By whose authority are you using force?
Can I see the magistrate's order?
- My advice, Mr Jinnah, is to go back.
- Stop this slaughter.
Now!
Pull the men back.
Withdraw lathi charge!
In this great battle for our freedom,
let it not be said of us
that we are guilty of shedding blood.
But let it be said
that we suffer.
That we shed,
not somebody's blood,
but our own.
So, I put this resolution to congress...
We pledge ourselves to secure
complete independence for India,
through means of non-violence.
Members of Congress...
I beg to oppose this hasty resolution.
No one's desire for independence
is greater than mine.
Yet I wish to point out
that these methods...
this dragging in of religious symbols,
these radical marches and provocation
are now beginning to split the movement.
The method and goal proposed
by Mr Gandhi's...
No!
No!
Mahatma Gandhi!
Say 'Mahatma Gandhi'!
Mahatma Gandhi!
Mr Gandhi's resolution...
At this moment, the destiny of our country
is in the hands of two men
and one of them is Gandhi!
Therefore...
standing on this platform...
I appeal to him to pause,
to cry "Halt!"...
...before it is too late.
- No! No! No!
- No! No!
Mr Jinnah is right!
Do not bring religion into politics.
We are all Indians.
If we go down this road,
we will turn Hindu against Muslim,
in the end.
If we do not win our freedom together,
we will turn brother against brother.
The turning point?
I left the Congress Party.
If Congress was going to turn into
a Hindu party,
then somebody had to speak up
for the Muslims.
Why are you dressed like that?
Jin, you are so late. We're late.
The party started at eight o'clock.
The party?
The party at Lady Jeejeebhoy's.
- You said you'd take me.
- Of course. That party.
Well, I have to start for Delhi
on the ten o'clock train.
You go by yourself.
Again.
Ruttie, I have a practice to run.
I don't want to go dancing
with the baronets.
Jin... Jin...
The train...
Ruttie? Are you all right?
It's not your fault.
- No dancing...
- You've been drinking!
-  How dare you!
- Why are you cross with Mummy?
It's all right, darling.
Come and sit down.
I'm not cross with Mummy.
Did Mummy give you a kiss goodnight?
No, silly. Mummy never puts me to bed.
Anita puts me to bed.
Anita, take her back to her room.
I have to go, sweetheart.
- You're always going away.
- I know. I'm sorry.
Go to bed. There's a good girl.
Hello? Dr Patel, please.
Patel? Jinnah.
Can you come immediately?
Thank you.
Sir, Kanji Sahab is here, sir.
- Kanji, thank God.
- Ready to go?
Kanji, I... I found these.
- Where is she?
- She's asleep. I couldn't...
Kanji, you knew about this?
Why didn't you tell me?
She didn't want you to know.
She has cancer.
It's eating up her insides.
That's why they prescribed the morphine.
Oh, God...
Ask... what is in your heart.
I can't. It's too private.
Go on, dear.
We can't keep the spirit waiting.
Ruttie.
What are they doing?
Will my Jinnah
get married again?
- When I die?
- No, Ruttie, no. Never.
The pretty dear wants to know
if her husband still loves her.
Like he used to.
Kanji. Please do something
before Mr Jinnah comes back.
The glass was right.
I did not love her as before.
I loved her and I needed her
much more.
But I never taught myself
to show that love.
If we win, here in Delhi,
the government will be forced to publish
casualty figures for Indians killed in battle.
I shall demand that
the compensation paid for Indian widows
is the same as they pay for Tommies'.
Sir, long-distance call from Bombay.
Thank you.
Muhammad Ali Jinnah speaking.
Yes.
I see.
I'll be on the next train.
My, er... my wife is very ill.
You'll have to carry the case.
- Do you still cry for her?
- No. Not for her.
Then why?
For love that is irretrievable.
So much love.
And it all melts away.
'Mr Birtwhistle has been accused
of subversive publications.'
By 'subversive', they mean
in favour of Indian independence.
He has also been
forcibly removed from India.
My Lord...
Either Mr Birtwhistle is a citizen of Britain
and a subject of the King Emperor,
or he is not.
And either India is part
of the British Empire, or it is not,
and the King Emperor is
its king and emperor, or he is not.
And I would remind the court...
...that it is treason
to pronounce that he is not.
Mr Birtwhistle.
Are you a citizen of Britain
and subject of the King Emperor?
- Indeed I am.
- And were you so one month ago?
Yes, I was.
And were you instructed to leave India?
- Yes.
- By whom?
By the office of the
Secretary of State for India.
My Lord...
No resident of... Bournemouth,
shall we say,
may be told that he is to repair to Scotland
and Scotland alone.
Since Magna Carta, the right to
free movement throughout the realm
has been established.
So it has.
My client has been denied that right
in that part of this realm known as India.
Tell me, Mr Jinnah,
in another place, I have heard you argue
that India is not part of this empire.
That is as it may be, My Lord.
However, I am not in that place now
and I'm conscious
of my humble role of advocacy
in this, your court.
Mr Birtwhistle,
you are a fortunate man.
Jinnah Sahab, the Muslims of India
need your leadership.
Iqbal Sahab,
lam flattered by the compliment,
from you,
our great poet and philosopher.
There are many who can provide
that leadership.
No, Jinnah.
We need a Muslim of the modern day.
Such as man has to lead
the struggle for Pakistan
and then be an inspiration to a country,
at its birth.
How can I even dare think
of myself as such a man?
There is no other.
For 200 years, the Muslims of India
have lost the directions of their destiny.
And now, as the mists clear,
a vision is born,
of a country of...
purity and compassion.
Pakistan.
Dr Iqbal, please.
Jinnah Sahab.
It's my turn to speak, please.
I know I haven't long to live.
Go back to India
and take charge of the League.
Go back to India.
Carve out a country.
'How? Where to start?
Jin!
My God, why didn't you write or wire?
I know. I'm sorry to intrude.
- Serious problem?
- Just polishing his teeth.
Sir, I beg your indulgence.
Would you mind coming back tomorrow?
We have urgent business.
What are you saying? I have paid.
Please.
I'm so sorry.
Fati, there's one thing that's been
bothering me.
I've spoken to Aunt Masiji.
- How to say this?
- Well, you're the lawyer.
I want you to contact decent families.
With boys that...
You understand.
Men, of about your age...
Suitable men.
- As head of the family, I...
-
You're going to matchmake for me?
That's so sweet.
For your happiness.
I resolved to give that up long ago.
The marriage, love, children.
I want to be there when we win.
Fati, forgive me.
I know you think I'm very modern.
You're as old-fashioned as they come.
We have swept the polls
throughout India.
The will of the people has put Pakistan
within our grasp.
The Muslim League has proved,
in the eyes of the world,
our right to represent
the Muslims of India.
A nation which has found its identity
and has, today, declared its will.
-  Pakistan.
-  Zindabad.
-  Pakistan.
-  Zindabad.
-  Pakistan.
-  Zindabad.
-  Quaid-e-Azam!
-  Zindabad!
-  Quaid-e-Azam!
-  Zindabad!
-  Quaid-e-Azam!
-  Zindabad!
-  Pakistan.
-  Zindabad.
-  Pakistan.
-  Zindabad.
-  Pakistan.
-  Zindabad.
-  Quaid-e-Azam!
-  Zindabad!
-  Quaid-e-Azam!
-  Zindabad!
-  'Quaid-e-Azam!
-  'Zindabad!
-  'Quaid-e-Azam!
-  'Zindabad!'
Jinnah Sahab.
Men must also be judged
by the love they have shown.
Apart from Ruttie,
who would you say you loved the most?
My sister Fatima.
My daughter Dina.
'And you think you treated them
as well as you could?'
Morning, my dear.
- Papa, I must speak to you.
- Of course. Sit down.
Papa, I want your permission to marry.
Marry?
But...
But you are far too young.
- Who?
- Neville.
Mr Wadia? But he's a Parsee.
Yes...
Dina, there are millions
of young Muslim boys in India.
- You can't do this to me.
- There were millions of Muslim girls.
And you married Mama.
She was a Parsee.
She became a Muslim.
Is Mr Wadia prepared
to embrace our faith?
No. But I will marry him.
Dina, if you do this,
you cannot call yourself my daughter
anymore.
- I forbid it.
- But...
But why?
Because it is against our customs.
Against our tradition.
I have fought for a Muslim State
and my daughter marries
outside the faith.
I am very proud that the girls
from our community have qualified
in law, in the sciences,
in English and Urdu,
Sanskrit, and even in Chinese.
Excellent.
The graduates from the Muslim College
will, no doubt, go on
to enrich the lives
of both Pakistan and India.
- Lady Mountbatten.
-
It gives me great pleasure
to give the Rattanbai Modi Award
for distinction in history
to Farida Shah.
Miss Jinnah, why have you invited
an Englishwoman to be our guest,
when they have only contempt for us?
Why should we have to shake
the hand of the enemy?
If you object to my presence,
I will willingly...
No, Lady Mountbatten.
My younger sister,
this is not the way we Muslims have
chosen to fight for our independence.
The British are our friends and our rulers.
We don't want them to be our rulers,
but we want them to remain our friends.
Now, sister.
Come and take your prize.
Panditji it is dangerous.
There are demonstrations
against our party by Pathan tribesmen.
Khan Sahab,
I'll speak to them, don't worry.
Muslim League members.
Stop the car, I want to talk to them.
I said stop!
Silence!
My friends and comrades.
My fellow citizens of India.
Throughout my tour
of the North-West Frontier,
I have been dismayed and saddened
by the demonstrations of violence
and opposition
directed against the Congress Party
in this great province.
Congress... Congress is a party
with no religious boundaries.
It is for Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs,
Christians, without distinction...
of caste or creed.
My dear fellow. I'm so sorry.
Why on Earth are you giving speeches
in the Frontier?
I thought Edwina specifically told you
not to go.
Dickie, I thank you for your concern,
my friend.
- Does Edwina know about the incident?
- Of course.
Nothing stays secret in India.
Well...
Let me tell you both that...
I will never accept that we,
in Congress,
can't represent the Muslims.
And one stone won't stop me.
My dear Jawaharlal,
this is not one stone.
It's an avalanche.
This election is disastrous
for your Congress Party.
The Muslim League
has won the Punjab.
It's won Bengal, it's won the Frontier.
What did you expect?
They have a majority in those provinces.
Yes. Who've given their votes
to Mr Jinnah.
And now he'll demand
that with these provinces,
he has the basis for Pakistan.
He can break away.
Oh, Dickie. This is dangerous nonsense.
Those provinces have minorities
of Sikhs and Hindus. Millions of them.
- So?
- They will never be safe in Pakistan.
That, my dear Jawaharlal,
is precisely what Mr Jinnah says
about the Muslims in India,
under your party's rule.
Yes, I know, I know. But...
but don't you see?
There are Hindu fanatics
in our own party.
And with all this talk
of a Muslim Pakistan,
they are beginning to demand
a Hindu India.
If they split the Congress,
the Muslim League
will be the strongest party in India.
Unless I give Jinnah his Pakistan,
and split the country first.
My friends, this is a historic day.
The Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten,
has conveyed to me
the decision of the British government
to concede, to us,
the creation of the State of Pakistan.
A partition commission is being set up
under Sir Cyril Radcliffe,
with three Muslim judges
and three Hindus,
to mark out the borders
of Pakistan.
Great Leader! Emperor of Pakistan!
Great Leader! Emperor of Pakistan!
No!
I am nobody's emperor.
Iam a soldier,
in the service of the birthright of Pakistan.
Wait.
Who are you?
And why do you want to kill me?
You're a traitor, Jinnah.
If there is to be a Pakistan,
it must be a Muslim state!
- Pakistan will be a Muslim state.
- Yes. But with you as leader.
You speak of the rights of Christians,
of Hindus.
You talk of the rights of women.
You are an ignorant fool.
I have fought for your mother,
your sister, and your children's children
to live in dignity.
Islam doesn't need fanatics like you.
Islam needs men of vision
who will build the country.
Now, grow up!
And serve Pakistan.
Thank you, Nadeem.
Now, that's one thing
Indians are not good at.
I only meant baking cakes.
I must teach the cook.
Lady Wavell absolutely spoilt him.
Jawaharlal...
We're moving ahead.
It's within shooting distance,
independence.
Dickie should insist
on Gandhiji's proposal
and offer him again
the prime-ministership of a united India.
Don't start wavering now.
You must be prime minister of India,
and giving away Pakistan
is the only way.
What are you two discussing?
The impossibility of Indians
baking proper English cakes.
The cake needs the right ingredients.
That's not what's depressing Jawaharlal.
Come on, old boy. Jinnah can have
his truncated little country.
He'll come limping back to you
in a matter of months.
Jinnah will beg for reunification.
And then, it'll be up to you,
Jawaharlal, to be magnanimous.
I'll see to it.
Then you still don't know him.
He'll beg for nothing.
My dear Jawaharlal,
The anniversary of my victory in Burma
falls in August.
Wouldn't it be a great triumph
if it coincided with the date of the
independence of India and Pakistan?
You mean... delay the transfer of power
by four months?
No. I mean,
bring it forward by eight months.
India will gain her independence
on the 15th of August 1947.
Pakistan will have to scramble
to get itself ready.
'Mountbatten changed the date
to force Pakistan into failure.
'He would not permit us
to have our own army.'
But when the Muslims threatened
to mutiny,
- He backed down.
- Ah...
So you are not beyond manipulation
and a little bit of blackmail.
I wouldn't put it like that.
Let us just say...
persuasion..
Mama! Mama!
What will you say to Dickie?
I'll say I was with you. Talking.
He wants us to be close.
I feel that too, but... but why?
Well, if there's one person in the world
who can explain something so difficult,
he stands before me.
Really?
The mind of an Anglo-German aristocrat?
- Even that.
- Well.
There's the deep answer
and the shallow answer.
Oh, give me the shallow one first.
You won't mind if it's indelicate?
Guide's honour.
After being married for 20 or more years,
Dickie doesn't want you anymore,
in that compelling way.
And the deep reason?
It's because...
he understands that friendship is rare
and that we have found it.
And he wants to be a part of it.
He wants it to be the three of us
and he's willing to...
This is difficult.
- It's not a sharing...
- No, no, you're right.
He has the deepest admiration for you.
You see,
you have more than he ever had.
Oh, he has power.
But you have the love of millions and...
He wants to feel there's something...
very strong...
...something very deep,
between you and him, too.
Only, he can never bring himself to say it.
I know. He's an Englishman.
And the only way he knows
is to lend me to you.
Shh...
I understand.
Too well, perhaps.
Jawaharlal, can I ask you
one small thing?
- Anything, my dear.
- I know it's the one thing he wants.
- But he's too proud to ask.
- What? Dickie, proud?
We know he's Viceroy because he's
the best man on Earth for the job.
But for him, the doubt still remains that...
he's the King's cousin,
and that's why he got the job.
- But if Congress were to invite him...
- Were to invite him...
to become India's governor-general?
I think... it would be a great honour for us.
And it would please Bapu, I know.
But, Edwina,
there is one thing
I want you to promise me.
I promise.
There are difficult times ahead.
I want to make a pact with you.
To keep what is between you and me
free from any matters of politics.
I'll never ask the Prime Minister of India
for anything.
I feel what's between you and me is...
spiritual.
Its feet shall not touch the earth.
Excuse me, sir.
There is a matter I wish to discuss.
- What are these?
- Letters.
From Lady Mountbatten to Nehru, and...
from him to her.
Shameful things.
More shameful
for us to read them.
We don't read them, sir.
It was suggested we use them.
We do not descend to this level.
The shame is not theirs, it is ours.
- Destroy them.
- They are carving up our country!
Savaging our people.
Er... I... I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry.
I too am sorry...
for the thought that blackened
your generous mind.
Well, Jinnah Sahab.
A bit foolish of you.
You could've changed the
whole course of history with those letters.
Are you trying to play Satan with me?
Did I hear you say that I should use
blackmail against my political opponents?
It would have saved lives.
History is made by the will and the wants
of millions of people.
Not by some letters and blackmail.
Top right hand
for my personal ensign.
Crest instead of the Union Jack.
It's slightly larger, I think, as the shield
takes in the idea of Great Britain.
We can check with the School of Heralds.
Would it be proper to have
both the Union Jack and my own crest?
Ah, Mr Jinnah.
Good of you to come.
Viceroy.
Let me get straight to the point.
They've invited me to be
first governor-general of India.
There's no doubt
that you deserve the honour.
Mr Jinnah, what, then,
is Pakistan's position?
Lord Mountbatten, I can't say
I didn't anticipate that question.
It's quite clear to me
that one man cannot possibly be
the head of state of both nations.
Surely, it'll be a great symbol of friendship
between the two countries.
If we were at war, Lord Mountbatten,
you couldn't possibly order one side
to attack and the other to defend.
I see.
Whose name do you think
the Crown will approve, then?
The Muslim League has asked me
to submit my own.
Do you realise, Mr Jinnah,
this will cost you dear?
A few crores of rupees, perhaps.
Or a division of the spoils.
No, Mr Jinnah,
it will cost you the future of Pakistan.
Everything.
You won't have a wooden table or chair
in your office, in your Pakistan.
Or the money to buy
an olive-green army water bottle.
I left something behind me
of great value,
when I was forced to leave my city.
Well, Jinnah Sahab,
the sacrifice of a large house...
What is it, compared to the death
of millions for your Pakistan?
I was not referring to my house.
I was referring to my daughter.
Papa, we've come to say goodbye.
I'm sorry you're not coming with us
to Pakistan,
but... I understand.
I will visit you, Papa.
But my home is now in Bombay.
With my husband and my child.
Bibisahiba, Jinnah Sahab has come back.
Bring some tea.
The refugees are pouring into Pakistan.
There are stories of massacres.
Well, we'll send our army in to help them.
You haven't any army.
They've given Firozpur to India.
It's final.
But that is Muslim territory.
- And our major arsenal.
- It's Mountbatten.
With Nehru whispering in his wife's ear.
I'm glad you could spare me these
moments before you go, Miss Jinnah.
I will see you in Karachi, won't I?
You must be my guest, Your Excellency.
Oh, do call me Edwina.
Edwina, I invite you formally,
on behalf of the government,
and informally, to sneak in
whenever you wish.
But your heart is really in Hindustan,
isn't it?
Why do you say that?
Because I think we should start
by being honest with each other.
That's very welcome.
So... what do you mean by India...
Hindustan being nearer my heart?
Your friends.
Your particular friendship with...
- His name is Jawaharlal Nehru.
- Yes.
Nehru.
It goes very far, doesn't it?
Your friendship with him.
And he's a friend of your husband.
People have been talking, but...
people do talk.
- You know what they say about you?
- Me?
- There's nothing to talk about.
- On the contrary.
They say that you and your brother...
are obsessive.
That you're obsessed with this...
Pakistan.
Yes.
And that is the ideal
that holds us together.
Could you accept, as a friend,
someone who didn't share that ideal?
Who...didn't believe in Pakistan?
No.
I thought you might say that.
But I want you to know, Fatima, that...
if there can be a one-sided friendship,
I consider myself your friend.
Liaquat, I'm appointing you
first prime minister.
I will announce it
in the assembly tomorrow.
As for remuneration,
my salary, as governor-general,
will be one rupee a month.
We must be the first to set an example.
Are you feeling all right, sir?
'If we want to make
this great state of Pakistan
'happy and prosperous,
'we must concentrate wholly and solely
'on the well-being of the people.
'You are free.
Free to go to your mosques,
'free to go to your temples,
'or any other place of worship
in the State of Pakistan.'
My guiding principle
will be justice and fair play,
without any prejudice or ill will,
without any partiality or favouritism.
We must root out the poison
of corruption and nepotism.
Our inspiration
will be the golden principles
of the Holy Prophet,
peace be upon him.
And I know
that with your support and cooperation,
I can look forward
to the day when Pakistan
becomes one of the greatest nations
of the world.
Each family will be given a grant
and some accommodation, sir.
Something is wrong, sir.
Open the doors.
Oh, God!
No, sir, no. It's not for you, sir.
Allahu Akbar!
Jinnah Sahab, what would've happened
if you had not created Pakistan?
I don't know.
I had my fears.
Look what happened to the Jews
in Germany.
And to minorities all over the world.
India, please.
'Tensions had reached a high point
'around Babri Masjid,
'the mosque in the northern Indian city
of Ayodhya.
'Spurred on by powerful Hindu politicians,
a mob mentality would take over.
'A few would become scores,
then hundreds, thousands.
'Tired of their leaders' temporising,
'fired by religious zeal,
they attack.
'At the end of the assault,
only rubble would be left of...'
Is this the end result
of Hindu fanaticism?
These are the people I outlawed
when I was Prime Minister of India.
I disliked them as much as you.
Fortunately, they still remain a minority.
You realise, of course,
that these are the people who killed me?
And you know why, Quaid-e-Azam?
They accused me of giving way
to Pakistan.
I always thought that one day
British Raj would become
Ram Raj.
Some of them have come
thousands of miles.
I don't know what we can do
to help them.
- Assalamualaikum.
- Walaikumasalam, madam.
- How do you do, Lady Mountbatten.
- How do you do.
I am the social worker
in charge of this camp.
Madam, the conditions here are appalling.
There are no tents.
The officials are not at all cooperative.
She's saying that she's lost her son
and that her husband has died,
and is this
what they left their homeland for?
Madam, you gave me an award.
At Ahmedabad University.
Lady Mountbatten was there.
Yes, I remember you clearly.
They've taken my sister.
My little sister.
She's gone!
There are hundreds
like her sister, on both sides.
Kidnapped, raped, and kept as slaves.
Too ashamed to identify themselves
or run away.
And their families wouldn't
accept them back, if they've been raped?
Would you accept your daughter,
under the same circumstances?
Of course!
Why don't you sit down?
I'll just get you some tea.
What can we do?
I'll do what I can here.
Meanwhile, on the other side,
use your influence with Nehru.
Get him to send troops
to stop the slaughter and kidnapping.
Fatima, he's no longer just a friend.
He's Prime Minister of India.
And for... all sorts of reasons, I can't.
I shouldn't.
I'll talk to him.
Mountbatten has promised us
complete army support.
And yet, all British officers
are confined to barracks.
Sir.
The Maharaja of Kashmir
has signed the state over to India!
That's impossible!
Kashmir is a Muslim state.
Kashmir is the jugular vein of Pakistan.
Sir, we have reports
that the Indian army
is already in Kashmir.
And they're being... personally directed
by Mountbatten.
Lord Mountbatten
has deceived us.
And he still pretends to be our friend.
He is due here tomorrow,
on a state visit, and...
I'll snub him!
We must learn to rise above
these differences, Liaquat.
He is our guest.
So, Jinnah Sahab,
your story is that most of the blame
lies with the Mountbattens.
Only as much as they are guilty of.
Of course, you don't know
what happened to Mountbatten.
No.
For a while, it was rumoured
that he was a Soviet spy.
In the end,
he became a symbolic target
for the Irish Republican Army.
My Lord, may I open,
for the prosecution?
Your case, Jinnah Sahab.
Lord Mountbatten stands accused
of being, from the first,
an enemy
of Pakistan.
Guilty or not guilty?
- I created the wretched country.
-
Order! Order! Order!
I submit five pieces of evidence.
One:
Lord Mountbatten advanced
the date of partition by eight months,
hoping that the new country
would be like a regiment of soldiers
parachuted into enemy territory
without maps.
Secondly: Lord Mountbatten interfered
in the division of land
between India and Pakistan,
giving the whole military arsenal
at Firozpur to India,
after it had been allocated to Pakistan.
I now call Sir Cyril Radcliffe,
who drew up the boundary
and was then forced to change it.
Sir Cyril,
did the Radcliffe Commission
award Firozpur to Pakistan?
Yes, it did. At first.
- Why?
- It was a Muslim majority district.
Sir Cyril, did Lord Mountbatten
issue any orders to you?
Oh, yes. He gave me a verbal order.
You see, the border near Firozpur
became a curve
and I was instructed
to make it a straight line.
Thus transferring hundreds of thousands
of people from one country to another
and leaving Pakistan without
one major army arsenal.
- That is correct.
-
Order! Order!
Thank you, Sir Cyril.
And lastly,
this mess over Kashmir.
My Lord,
there was no mess over Kashmir.
Even I know that there've been
three wars fought over Kashmir
since you left it the way you did.
The mess was not of my making.
Mr Jinnah hates to lose.
He signed a document allowing
the Maharaja of Kashmir
to choose either India or Pakistan.
- He chose India. Now he cries foul.
-  My Lord...
I did sign
and the Maharaja of Kashmir,
being a Hindu,
with a population 80 per cent Muslim,
should have signed to Pakistan.
My Lord,
lam guilty.
Guilty of trusting Lord Mountbatten
and the British army officers
who came to command my army
at my request.
My Lord, I call General Gracey.
General Gracey,
you were the army commander
in Pakistan.
Yes.
Did you receive intelligence
that Indian regiments,
under Lord Mountbatten's command,
had been airlifted into Kashmir
- Yes.
- Were you ordered,
by the government of Pakistan,
as its army commander,
to resist that invasion?
Yes, I was.
And did you resist it?
No, I... I...
Perhaps you'd be good enough
to explain to the court.
I'm a British officer.
The Indian side
was led by British officers.
I wasn't going into a war with
other officers commissioned by the King.
I refused.
But, General Gracey,
that is mutiny.
Well, mutiny is a rather large word
for a country like Pakistan to use.
Thank you, General Gracey.
That will be all.
And now, a question
to Lord Mountbatten himself.
Why did you not stop the slaughter?
Why did you not send in your troops?
As I said to you before, Mr Jinnah,
British troops could not get involved
in your squabbles.
Britain had to withdraw. With honour.
After 200 years of looting, exploitation,
and colonial theft,
I suppose there is...honour...
among thieves.
My Lord, I rest my case.
Jinnah Sahab, one last question.
Mind you, I ask all of them this.
If you had your time again,
would you do the same thing?
Yes.
But I would want others
to behave differently.
And if you were to ask
one person for forgiveness,
just one,
who would you choose?
The time is past.
Perhaps it still can be arranged.
- What's your name?
- Zakia.
- Where are you from?
- Firozpur.
And where are you going?
To Pakistan.
That's a brave girl.
Pakistan was made for you.
You're safe now.
Will my mother meet me in Pakistan?
Shh...
I'm sorry, sir. She's distracted.
She lost her mother.
It has been very hard.
Abbajan,
maybe the old man has seen Amma.
Shh...
Do you know who he is?
This is the Quaid-e-Azam.
I'm sorry, sir. We beg your forgiveness
for her not recognising you.
But... she's only a child.
It is I who should ask you for forgiveness.
For any part I have had
in what has happened to you.
No, no, sir.
I bless you with all my heart.
Allah blesses you.
Pakistan Zindabad!
Pakistan Zindabad!
Pakistan Zindabad!
- Pakistan!
-  Zindabad!
- Pakistan!
