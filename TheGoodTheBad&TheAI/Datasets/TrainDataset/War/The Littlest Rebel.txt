- Thank you. That will be all, Moses.
- Yes, ma'am.
May I have some of
those cookies, Miss Virgie?
Of course you may.
James Henry.
Serve these cookies to Master Harold
and wipe his chin.
Yes, ma'am, Miss Virgie.
Another portion of ice cream
for you, Miss Gladys?
No, thank you, I've had enough.
There ain't no more ice cream, Miss Virgie.
I'll only ask them once. I won't coax.
More cake or ice cream for you,
Master Philip?
Nothing more for me, thank you.
Would you care for more ice cream,
Master Harold?
Yes.
Perhaps you would rather have another nice,
great big piece of cake.
No,just ice cream.
Is this for me?
Course not.
Serve it to young Master Harold.
Seems like he could've just
reached over and took it...
instead of this roundabout way.
That child of yours
is certainly the perfect hostess.
She takes after her mother.
I can easily understand
why you two worship her.
I'm afraid that's a failing
common to all parents.
Listen, everyone. Listen!
How would you like to see Uncle Billy dance?
All right,James Henry.
Let's get going, son.
James Henry?
How about you dancing too?
Oh, no, ma'am, Miss Virgie.
The body is willing,
but the feet just stays too close to the ground.
Come, dear. Excuse yourself for a moment.
Some other little friends want to see you.
Will you please excuse me
for a minute?
Yes, Miss Virgie.
Now, you took some gumption and talk
right out to Miss Virgie. Don't be scared.
Hello, Sally Anne.
Hello, Dinah.
- Hello.
- Go on now, Sally Anne.
Miss Virgie...
Please, ma'am...
We all done come here
to wish you many happy -
- happy-
- Returns.
That's it!
Many happy returns of the day.
And we all done made you a doll,
and here it is.
Miss Virgie, there was more
I had to say, but-
Mammy, I forgot it.
You said everything, Sally Anne.
Don't you worry.
This is the very nicest present I got.
Thank you ever so much.
Yes, indeed, children. It was very thoughtful
and sweet. Come now, dear.
I'll see you later,
and I'll save you some cake.
We'll be waiting!
I hope you'll excuse me, Miss Virgie...
if I don't bow very low,
but these britches are too tight.
That's perfectly all right, Master Harold.
Just bow as far as you can.
That's far enough.
Be careful.
- Captain Cary?
- There's Cary.
- Here.
Fort Sumter was fired on this morning, sir.
War is declared.
You are to present yourself at the armory
immediately, sir, with horse and sidearms.
All men of the Richmond Graves
report in the city before nightfall.
Captain Cary, send a slave down the valley
to report the news.
I'm riding north among the river plantations.
Thank you, sir.
Hurrah!
Come on, boy.
Listen, you get the children.
I'll meet you outside at the carriage.
Isn't this terrible?
What are we going to do?
- I reckon I'd better get your things together.
- I'll leave as soon as I can.
Mrs. Cary, I think we ought
to get the children home.
- The road may be filled with soldiers before night.
- That's true.
We'll be mobilizing
tonight and tomorrow.
- Tom, get the carriages ready
as quickly as you can.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, darling.
We've got to hurry.
Good-bye, Miss Virgie.
Wait for me!
Bye, Miss Virgie.
Bye, Miss Virgie.
Take him right away, boss.
There you go. Come on! Come on!
- Good-bye, Mr. Cary.
- Good-bye.
Come on here,Jimmy.
Hold it.
Uncle Billy...
I don't think it was very polite
to chase everybody out of my party like that.
Their mammies have
to get 'em home quick.
You see, honey child,
there's going to be a war.
What's a war?
Well, a war is a lot
of soldiers and battles...
where men kill each other with guns.
Really and truly kill each other?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Why?
Seem like to me, honey,
no one knows why.
I hear a white gentleman say there's a man
up North who wants to free the slaves.
What does that mean,
"free the slaves''?
I don't know what it means myself.
It's funny, isn't it?
There's Daddy! It's Daddy!
My daddy's the best soldier
in the whole army.
Ready, halt!
Company, march!
Oh,James Henry,
you always do it wrong.
I see the Yankees here last week.
When they say " march,'' they starts.
When they say " halt,'' they stops.
Well, that's just why I do it different.
I wouldn't do anything
those Yankees do!
Look! Here they come again,
Miss Virgie! Look!
- Come on!
- Come on, Miss Virgie! They might hurt you!
- Come on, Miss Virgie.
- I'm not going to run.
- They's liable to hurt you.
- I just won't budge.
- I'll show them I'm not afraid.
- I is!
- Ain't you a speck afraid, Miss Virgie?
- No, I'm not.
What are you afraid of them for?
Oh, honey child, them Yankees is mighty powerful.
They can even change the weather.
- Yes?
- Whenever they come around...
I never know whether
it's winter or summer.
I'm shiverin' and sweatin'
at the same time.
- Go and tell Mother they're coming.
- I think I better.
Troops, halt!
Good Lord, Miss Virgie!
You is startin' another war!
- Who did that?
- I did.
- Well, you're truthful anyway.
- My mommy and daddy
taught me never to tell a lie.
They're right. Who are you?
- I'm a Confederate.
- So you're a little rebel, eh?
I'm not a rebel. My daddy said so.
I'm a Confederate.
- Your daddy a soldier?
- He's the best soldier in the whole world.
- Is he around here now?
- I wouldn't tell you if he was.
Got a lot of spunk, haven't you?
- Well, I'm not afraid of you.
- Well, I'm glad you're not.
I think it'd be awful if a nice,
little girl like you were afraid of me.
Nevertheless, you better
mind your manners, young lady...
and don't use that slingshot again.
I wish I was in Dixie
Hooray, hooray
In Dixieland I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Away, away
Away down South in Dixie
Away, away
Away down South in Dixie
- Mommy?
- Yes, Virgie.
When is Daddy
coming to see us again?
Oh, we can't tell, darling. He's a long
distance away, and it's not so easy as it was.
- Why isn't it?
- Because we're in enemy territory now.
What does " enemy territory'' mean?
Well, it means that the Yankees have captured
this land, and it doesn't belong to us anymore.
And every time that Daddy comes to see us,
he has to cross through the enemy lines...
and that's very dangerous.
I can't understand it.
I say my prayers every night...
and I say a special prayer
for Daddy to come and see us...
but it doesn't seem to do any good.
So yesterday I started
praying in the daytime too.
I prayed twice yesterday,
and I prayed three times today.
I'm sure it'll work now, Mommy.
Here comes Daddy!
It's Daddy!
- Massa Cary.
- Uncle Billy.
Tears?
Joy!
Me too, Daddy. Look.
Southerners never cry.
- Oh, what are these things then?
- Raindrops.
- On a sunshiny day? Aww!
- Ohh!
Can you stay long this time, Daddy?
Not this time either, darling.
I have to get right on.
I'll see if Rosabelle
has your lunch ready.
- Are they getting a fresh horse for me?
- Everybody knows just what to do.
- We practice it every day.
- Oh, God love you!
Miss Virgie,
I brought you some water and a towel.
- I thought maybe Massa Cary
would like to wash his face.
- Thank you,James Henry.
Didn't nobody tell me to do it either.
I thought of it all by myself.
Well, you must be thinking better
than you used to,James Henry.
Yes, sir, Massa Cary.
I even think more often now.
-James Henry!
- Yes, Miss Virgie?
Didn't I tell you
to bring this water?
That's right. It was you.
I thought it was Uncle Billy.
What was that I thunk up
all by myself?
Oh, yes. I was gonna polish
Massa Cary's boots.
Didn't nobody tell me to do that,
did they?
Never mind my boots,James Henry.
Go water my horse.
Yes, sir, Massa Cary.
Daddy?
Are we winning the war?
Well, things are going along.
- Will it last much longer?
- Mm, I hope not.
- Do you have to work hard in the war?
- We all have to do our share.
Every time I see you
you're always so tired.
Well, I'm not tired now.
You're giving me new strength.
I miss you, Daddy.
Do you miss me?
Indeed I do.
You know when I miss you the most?
At twilight when you used to sing to me.
Let's pretend it's twilight now, Daddy.
Now, you just close your eyes and make out
you're tired, and I'll sing to you now.
Why, I was humming in my sleep.
Aw, you were not!
Tom's bringing up another horse.
- That's fine. Oh, Tom?
- Yes, sir, Massa Cary?
- Give him some water and fill
those saddlebags with oats.
- Yes, sir, Massa Cary.
I'll go to the stables for you, Daddy.
I can run faster.
I'd better get going while the coast is clear.
I've got to find out...
where Sheridan's army's camping
and report to General Lee before nightfall.
I'm so worried about you
on these scouting expeditions.
If they catch you,
you'll be shot as a spy.
As long as they don't find any dispatches on me,
and I'm not wearing a Yankee uniform...
- I'd only be arrested as a prisoner of war.
- As if that weren't bad enough.
- Please be careful.
- You know I will.
- I'll push. It'll make you go faster.
- Oh, go on now.
- Go on, hurry!
- Oh!
- How is she, Uncle Billy?
- Oh, fine, Massa Cary. Fine, sir.
We's only got two left,
but they both good, sir.
Two left?
Well, I've had to sell or trade
nearly all the stock for food-
that is, all that weren't stolen.
I've saved the horses till the last,
knowing you might need them.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- This is the part of the war
we women must fight, darling.
Push me!
I pushed the oats all the way
from the stables, Daddy.
It's a wonder this lazy jackass
didn't eat 'em up on the way.
Go on back to that stable, boy.
Yankees, Massa Cary!
Yankees! They's comin'!
Go ahead, son. I got him.
Good-bye, darling.
Don't be afraid.
Please be careful.
- Good-bye, honey.
- Oh, Daddy.
Come on, darling.
Daddy has to hurry.
Let's see you smile.
Oh, that's only a half o' one.
Come on now.
Give Daddy a grand, big fat smile.
Oh, that's fine.
Come on, Massa Cary.
Hurry, please, sir.
I'll try to cross the river the other side
of the old mill. I can hide in the woods.
I'll fire three quick shots
to let you know I'm safe.
Keep them here long as you can.
I'll need the time. Good-bye.
- God ride with you, darling.
- Oh, Daddy?
- Yes, dear?
- Give all my love to General Lee.
I will, honey.
Seth! Seth!
Where's them Yankees at?
They're just turning off
the main road.
- Get that corn from the barn into the house.
- Yes, sir.
Quick!
I can carry two, Rosabelle.
There you is, child.
Come on, children.
Come on. Hurry.
- Are they in sight yet?
- No, ma'am, Missa Cary.
- Here, you put this away. I'll watch.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on. Come on, hurry.
Uncle Billy!
Here they come!
Here they come!
Rosabelle, get in the drawing room and start
sewing just like you surprised to see 'em.
- Yes, Uncle Billy.
- The rest of you, out in the stable, quick.
Uncle Billy, do you think the Yankees
will find us in the secret room?
Don't you be a-scared, child.
There ain't nothing to worry about.
- There is somethin' to worry about if you's white.
- What you mean?
They won't hurt us, 'cause we's slaves.
They's fightin' for us.
But if you's white and Southern,
then you's the enemy.
Oh, don't pay him no mind.
Go on, children. Get in there and hide.
All right, Uncle Billy.
Get in now. You too young to see
anything that may happen.
- What's the matter, Miss Virgie?
- My dress is caught.
For a man they ain't gonna hurt...
you do a powerful lot of shivering
every time the Yankees comes around.
My mind says they ain't gonna hurt me,
but my body don't believe it.
Aahh!
- Where's Missa Cary?
- I don't know. I ain't seen her.
- Stand up, you!
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
We're looking for a spy.
Is there a rebel hiding in this house?
No, sir. No, sir, Massa General.
Nobody at all, sir.
- Who lives here?
- Missa Cary, sir.
- Is she married?
- Yes, sir.
- Where's her husband?
- I-
- Is he a rebel?
- I-
- Is he a rebel?
- He's away in the war, sir.
In the Confederate Army?
- Yes, sir.
- Where is she?
She's around,
but I don't know where, sir.
Search the house, men.
She's hiding someone.
- If she wasn't, she'd be here.
- Yes, sir. Come on, men.
Barnes, Lorny, Robinson, upstairs.
The rest of you men take the lower floor.
- Start in back. Mason, deploy all your men.
- Yes, sir.
- Bring me a drink.
- We ain't got nothin', sir, 'cepting apple cider.
- Well, bring me that.
- Yes, sir, Massa General.
- You, get me something to eat.
- We ain't got-
- Get me something to eat!
- I'll try, sir.
Here's something, men.
Keep it covered.
Yes, sir, I was just on my way out.
What were you doing in that closet?
I-I went in there to get me some air.
Oh, you go into a dark closet to get air,
do you?
Yes, sir. You see, I'm a man
who likes to change his air.
I gets tired of regular old air.
So every little once in a while,
I go in someplace...
and get me some good closet air.
Come on, come on. Get out of here.
Search it, men.
- Nobody back there, sir.
- Any trapdoors in the floor?
- Couldn't find any, sir.
- Well, keep your eyes open.
- Yes, sir.
- Watch for secret panels.
These houses all have 'em.
- Why did you drop that pitcher?
- It just slipped off the tray, sir.
Slipped, eh? It slipped when I said
something about secret panels.
- That's when it slipped, didn't it?
- I didn't hear you say it, sir.
- Now listen, you-
- Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
- Find anything?
These oats out in front,
and the ground nearby was wet...
as though a horse had been watered
and the saddlebags filled.
These oats ain't been there 1 0 minutes.
The sun hasn't turned 'em yet.
Search the stables and rush some
men down to the river near that old mill.
- That's where he'll cross ifhe gets away.
- Yes, sir.
Come on, boys.
Here, take this to the kitchen
and get the general some more cider.
- Sergeant.
- Find anything?
- Nothing up there.
- There's a trapdoor in the kitchen.
I'm gonna find out what's under it.
- Did you find anything?
- Let's look around-
What are you doing glued to that wall?
You've been lying. Now, come on.
I've got something!
Look at this.
There must be somebody in there.
- It's a secret panel.
- It ain't nothing, sir.
- Open it.
- It's just a wall, sir.
- Bust it in.
- Wait a minute. I'll open it.
It's just two little babies in there.
That's all.
Well, this ain't much
to get excited about.
Nothing to eat, eh? And no liquor?
Well, this is pretty good.
Hurry up.
Get out ofhere. Come on.
Come on. Get out of here.
Hurry up.
Get one of those hams
and have it cooked.
- Yes, sir.
- You boys can get yourselves
a couple of drinks too.
Yes, sir!
Ah, right down the scuppers.
Come here, you.
Pull off these boots.
Why, you little black rascal!
I'll tan your hide for this!
- Come here, you little rascal!
- You let me go! You let me go!
White, by gad!
Who told you to put that black on?
I guess your daddy told you to do it.
Your daddy's a soldier, isn't he?
Why, I wouldn't hurt a little girl like you.
Maybe you'll tell me where your daddy is.
I'd like to talk to him.
Come here, you!
- She didn't mean nothing, master.
- Don't you dare touch that child!
- Turn me loose!
- Mother! Mother!
- Run, Virgie, run!
- Let me go!
Mother! Mother!
I didn't mean to shove ya.
Don't you hurt my mother!
Don't you dare hurt my mother!
- You let her alone! Attention!
What's going on here?
Are you hurt, madam?
No.
- Who's in command here?
- I am, sir.
Do you know what he did?
He broke our table, and he wanted to hurt me,
and he threw my mommy down the stairs.
Put that loot back where you got it.
- Lieutenant Harte.
- Yes, sir.
Take him outside and give him 25 lashes.
Beat him till he bleeds.
Investigate the others. If you find any
of them guilty, give them five lashes each.
Yes, sir. Come on, Dudley.
I can't tell you
how sorry I am, madam.
And you too, miss.
- Why, you were crying, weren't you?
- Not very much.
You look like you've been
climbing up the chimney.
Your men were the cause of it.
Just wait till I tell my Daddy about this.
He'll go and kill your whole Yankee army!
And I won't blame him a bit.
Blow.
Thank you.
Now you run along and play.
There's a rebel scout, madam,
known to be in this neighborhood.
I'm sorry to have to question you after
what's already occurred, but it's necessary.
- I know nothing of him.
- I happen to know that you do. He's your husband.
- Have you seen him today?
- No.
Would you tell me if you had?
Would you expect me to?
I'm afraid not.
- What is it, Sergeant?
- We found a horse in a corral
half a mile below here, sir.
Shows signs ofhaving been ridden hard
a short while ago.
He changed horses here.
Send five men to the river.
Put two sharpshooters on the roof
of that old mill so they can cover both banks.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
A godsend.
In that case, I'm afraid there's no longer
any necessity for my staying.
Good day, madam.
And good day to you,
you little rebel.
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir?
Countermand that order.
He's already across.
- All right, we're going back to camp.
- Yes, sir.
Come in!
I don't think we should stay here
a second longer, Missa Cary.
The Yankees is already down by the east pasture,
and we's right in the line of fire.
You better hurry.
The shells is droppin' in the yard now.
Please, hurry.
Don't be afraid.
- Uncle Billy, can't we get to the slaves' quarters?
- No, ma'am.
They's firin' there now.
Excuse me, Captain.
One of your slaves is outside.
Wants to see you. He says it's very important.
- What? One of my slaves?
- Yes, sir.
- How could he have gotten through
the Yankee lines? Send him in.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, Massa Cary,
thanks the Lord I found you, sir.
- What is it, Uncle Billy?
- Missa Cary, she's awful sick, sir.
- Sick?
- Yes, sir. I's afraid, Massa Cary. I's afraid, sir.
She keeps asking for you all the time.
- What happened?
- Sir, they fought right in front of the house.
The house was burned down.
Missa Cary, she catch her death of cold.
She's coughing bad.
How long has this been going on?
She was sick for three weeks
and gettin' worse.
Then I decided I better fetch you.
I been going from camp to camp
looking for you for over a week now.
- Most of the slaves run away.
- And Virgie- How's little Virgie?
Oh, she's fine, sir.
Never complain about nothing and always cheerful.
She's been a great comfort
to Missa Cary.
But I's afraid Missa Cary
needs you now, sir.
- I'll get a leave of absence right away.
- Yes, sir.
I've got some logs in the river
covered with brush.
We can float down past the Union camps, then cut
inland 'cross through the Chickahominy Swamp.
- Well, hurry. We'll have to get
into the swamp before daybreak.
- Yes, sir.
Here's the Union camp now, sir.
It's only an hour before daylight.
- Do you think we can do it, Massa Cary?
- Well, we can try. Come on.
You're feeling better now,
aren't you, Mommy?
Yes, dear, much better.
I bet it won't be long
before Daddy is here.
He'll make everything all right.
You'll see.
We-We mustn't be too sure, darling.
Then we won't be so disappointed
if he doesn't get here.
Perhaps Uncle Billy didn't
get through the Yankee lines.
Uncle Billy can do anything.
He can sing and dance
and climb trees...
and do everything in the world.
I know he can bring Daddy back.
Now, I have my housework to do...
so you just lie quiet until I finish.
Mother's very proud of you, darling.
I'll be right back.
Rosabelle, you're crying.
No, Miss Virgie, I ain't cryin', child.
My eyes just kinda slipped.
Well, my daddy will be here soon...
and then your eyes
won't have to slip.
Yes'm, Miss Virgie.
What are you doing there,
James Henry?
Well, I sleeps in that kitchen...
and I wants to hear them Yankees
when they's a-comin'...
so I dug this hole.
I's gonna cover it over,
so when they walks across it...
they'll fall in,
but they'll make a heap of noise.
And then I'll hear 'em,
and I'll start runnin'.
- I hope nobody else falls in it.
- Yes, ma'am.
Look!
Here comes Uncle Billy now!
But he didn't bring Daddy.
- Here comes Daddy!
- Massa Cary's comin'!
- Praise the Lord!
- Daddy! Daddy!
My darling.
Praise the Lord, Missa Cary.
He does come!
The whole Yankee army couldn't stop him.
He's done come.
Thank heaven.
I had to live till you got here
and I knew Virgie'd be safe.
Please don't talk like that, dear.
Didn't I tell you that Uncle Billy
would find him, Mommy?
Yes, dear.
I bet now that Daddy is here...
it won't be long before we have
a great big house again.
- Will it, Daddy?
- No, darling.
Oh, Daddy, I wish Mommy
didn't have to be sick.
Shh. You've got to be
a brave little girl, darling.
Well, can't I be brave
and wish Mommy wasn't sick too?
Of course, Virgie.
Mother isn't going to be sick
much longer now.
She's going to sleep, darling.
And if there are dreams
in that... sleep...
oh, my darlings...
how I'll dream of you.
Oh, Daddy,
I had a dream last night.
I dreamed Mommy and you
were putting me to bed.
And do you remember how you
used to tell me fairy tales?
- Come on, honey child.
- First Mother-
What is it, Uncle Billy?
What's the matter, Uncle Billy?
Why does everybody act so funny?
Is something wrong?
No, honey child.
There is something wrong.
Is it about my mommy?
Daddy, what is it?
Did something happen to my mommy?
Something very beautiful, darling.
That's how you must
always think of it-
that Mama'll never be ill again...
or frightened or discouraged.
She'll never suffer anymore.
Just-Just think of it...
as beautiful.
- Daddy?
- Yes, honey.
You won't ever leave me, will you?
No, I'll never let you
out of my arms again.
- Uncle Billy.
- Yes, Massa Cary?
There hasn't been a Yankee patrol
through here since morning.
There's bound to be one soon.
Get Miss Virgie's things ready.
- You mean, you're gonna take
Miss Virgie with you, Massa Cary?
- Yes.
- Through the Yankee line?
- I've got to get her to my sister in Richmond.
- But, Captain, it's dangerous. You can't do it, sir.
- Yankees, Daddy!
All of you go back to your cabins,
but don't hurry.
Rosabelle, you go with them
and see that they don't talk.
- Uncle Billy, you wait outside and watch.
- Yes, sir.
- Come, honey.
- Don't talk now.
Well, I didn't know-
I didn't know that hole was there.
Honey, do you remember how Mama
always taught you never to tell a lie?
- Oh, I never have, Daddy.
- I know, and Mama's proud of you for it.
But if those Yankees should come in here,
you've got to tell them a lie.
- You want me to tell a lie?
-Just this once, honey, for Daddy's sake.
And in a case like this,
it really isn't a lie.
If they should stop here
and they ask you...
tell them I was here but I left an hour ago,
and you saw me cross the river.
Now be a brave little Confederate, darling.
Do this for me.
- Daddy.
- Hmm?
- Would General Lee want me to tell that lie?
- Yes, dear, this once.
All right, then
I'll tell a whopper.
They's comin', Massa Cary!
Here, help me with this.
Don't be frightened.
Act as though you didn't know they were here.
All right, Massa Cary.
Put that table back up
against the wall.
Remember now, act as though nothing
had occurred. Dance or play or something.
We will, Daddy.
- What you all doin'?
- You got your mouth organ?
- Yeah.
- Well, get ready to use it.
Sergeant, take your men
and search that wood.
Cary's around here, and this time we've got to
get him. He's given us the slip long enough.
- Hurry now. Move fast.
- Yes, sir.
All right, men, let's go.
Well, that was quite a concert.
And how is the littlest rebel of them all?
Fine, Yankee.Just fine.
Do you mind if I warm
my hands at your fire?
No, sir.
- You two all alone here?
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. My daddy was here,
but he left an hour ago.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir. He was here.. .
but he left an hour ago,
and I saw him cross the river.
Well, now, that's very interesting.
I know another dance.
Oh, yes, sir.
She know a lot of dances.
Now, dance for the gentlemen,
honey child.
What was your father doing here?
My mommy was very sick,
and she kept asking for Daddy.
So yesterday Uncle Billy brought him...
and this morning
my mommy went away.
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry.
But my daddy says I must always
think of it as beautiful.
Your daddy's right. You see,
I have a little girl, too,just about your age...
and I'd feel awful sorry
if her mommy went away.
- Has your little girl got a pony?
- And a cart.
Does she get enough
to eat and everything?
You had the table out
in the center of the room, eh?
- No, sir.
- No, sir.
- What are those tracks?
- I made them with my foot.
Is that a trapdoor
in the ceiling there?
No, sir. There ain't nothing up there.
Nothing at all, sir.
- You've been lying to me.
- No, sir, I haven't.
- Your father's here now!
- No, sir, he isn't!
- You know he is!
- He was here, but he left an hour ago.
- I saw him cross the river.
- You tell me the truth, or I'll give you the worst-
-Just a minute!
- Drop your pistol.
Now, come down
and keep your hands up.
Back over against that door.
Turn around and keep those hands up.
Daddy.
All right, you can drop them now,
but no funny business.
Oh, Daddy, I didn't do it right, did I?
Yes, you did, darling.
Daddy's proud of you.
I said just what you told me to.
You were perfect,
and I was only fooling about the whipping.
I really wasn't going to.
Run outside, darling.
Daddy'll call you.
Come on, Uncle Billy.
Can you arrange so that
my arrest won't frighten her?
- I'll try.
- Thanks.
- Any papers on you?
- No, I'm not scouting this trip, Colonel.
I came home to bury my dead...
and take my little girl to
Richmond, where my sister is.
I see.
Well, come on.
Let's get it over with.
I'm afraid I won't be able to-
to bid my little girl good-bye.
I understand.
Will you tell her
I've gone back to General Lee?
I'll return soon.
- Yes, it would just about fit.
- What?
- The Yankee uniform.
- What do you mean?
- You know the Cartwright plantation?
- Well.
I left a uniform there
to be mended by the slaves.
If you stole that uniform,
I don't know how I could stop you.
- You mean-
- If you were wearing a Union uniform...
and had a pass through the lines...
you'd stand a mighty good chance
of making Richmond.
- Where would I get a pass?
- From me.
I don't think my country expects me
to make war on babies.
I don't know what to say.
Of course, you realize what it means
if you're caught in my uniform.
Aren't you taking an awful
chance yourself, Colonel?
War's full of chances.
I won't forget this.
I hope you get through.
- God bless you.
- There's just one thing I ask.
In passing through our lines,
whatever you see or hear, forget.
My word of honor.
Daddy, Daddy!
The soldiers are coming back!
Get out the back way.
Follow the woods to the Cartwrights'.
Daddy, is the Yankee man
gonna be nice?
A man couldn't be nicer
than he's been.
You see, you've made me
think of my little girl.
- I knew all the time you weren't gonna whip me.
- Come on. We've got to hurry.
Good luck.
You're nice enough
to be a Confederate.
Good-bye, Uncle Billy.
- Any sign of him?
- Not a thing, Colonel.
Well, you men better come in and warm up.
There's a fire in here.
Yes, sir.
- No trace at all, eh?
- No.
But I'm sure he's still around here.
They buried his wife just an hour ago.
Look! There goes somebody.
- A man and a child?
- Yes. They're headed for the woods.
That's a slave and his pickaninny.
They just left here. They're all right.
- Do you hear anything?
- Horses. Listen.
We've got to go back.
Didn't the man give you
a paper to show them, Daddy?
Yes, but the Yanks around here
may recognize me.
I don't want to use the pass
until we get out of this neighborhood.
This isn't a good neighborhood anyway.
No. Come on.
- Halt!
- Whoa!
- Where are you going, sir?
- I'm taking this child to her
father just beyond our lines.
Colonel Morrison sent me.
Here's a pass.
Have you got a little girl, mister?
No, I've got a boy.
- Where'd you come from?
- Cary's plantation. Left there at noon.
- Why aren't you using the main road?
- Full of artillery.
How old is your little boy?
- Five.
- Oh, I'm six.
- My boy's bigger than you.
- He is?
Yes. This looks all right,
but I don't know.
We've got special orders to be on the watch
for Captain Cary, a rebel scout.
Didn't you hear?
They caught him this morning.
- They did?
- Yeah, Morrison's men, at his own plantation.
- What's your regiment?
- 72nd Vermont.
It's all right then. You'll find them camped
just a mile below here. Go ahead.
Thanks.
Oh, Daddy, you told a fib.
Well, this is war, honey.
Why isn't it a sin to tell a fib in war?
I don't know why it isn't a sin
to do any of the things we do in war.
What's the 72nd Vermont?
Well, that's a regiment of soldiers
I have no intention of meeting.
Halt!
Colonel Morrison asked me to
take this child to Greensburg.
- Here's his pass.
- Colonel Morrison?
- Yes.
- Where was he?
Cary plantation,
about 1 8 miles south ofhere.
- When did you leave there?
- Why-
- We left there at 1 2:00.
- Why, you know all the answers too, huh?
Yes, sir. I'm six years old.
Well, I guess you're all right.
Go ahead.
Wait a minute!
I wanna see that kid!
- Whose child is this?
- Friend of Colonel Morrison's.
- Ever see me before?
- No.
Ya didn't, eh?
Don't you remember the shoe polish?
- No!
- Well, I do.
Her old man's the most dangerous
scout in the rebel army.
This looks mighty funny to me.
Go get 'em! Hurry up!
Head 'em off!
Take the lower road!
Get under the seat quick, honey.
Halt!
Keep your hands up.
Are you armed?
- No.
- Let's see.
All right, we'll go back.
Follow us.
- Captain?
- Yes.
- I'm afraid I've got to give you some bad news.
- The appeal was denied, huh?
Every finding of the court-martial
was upheld.
- That means-
- Yes.
When does the... party take place?
The morning of the 27 th... at dawn.
Well, I still have six days.
Any messages you want sent?
I'll be glad to do anything I can, Captain.
You've been very kind...
especially so in getting Uncle Billy here
to look after my little girl.
- I appreciate that.
- I wish there was something
I could really do, Captain.
That child has literally captured us all.
- Colonel-
- Yes, I know.
I heard you.
No chance at all, eh?
No.
And is my little party set
for the morning of the 27 th too?
I'm sorry, Colonel.
He's innocent, Major.
All he did was try to help a child.
The evidence we couldn't overcome,
Colonel...
was the fact that you not only gave him a pass
but that he was wearing your uniform.
- I stole that uniform.
- We couldn't make them believe that.
I had hoped we could.
I'll be about, Colonel,
if there's anything you want done.
Thank you, Major.
Well, it was a gamble, and we lost.
I have no regrets.
When I think of my own little baby,
I'd do the same thing over again.
Why is a shoe called a shoe?
What?
I says, why is a shoe called a shoe?
What do you mean, why
is a shoe called a shoe?
Well, the world is full of names.
They could have picked out
any other name.
- Who could?
- Whoever did.
- I don't know who it was.
- Man, what are you talkin' about?
Why is a shoe called a shoe?
Massa Cary says that shows you got brains
when you're thinkin' 'bout things.
I spent all day yesterday thinkin',
why is a horse called a horse?
Aw, shut your mouth, will you?
What time is it now, Uncle Billy?
I heard the town clock strike 3:00
a while back, Miss Virgie.
Oh, we'll have to hurry.
Daddy always expects me at 3:30.
He says it makes
his afternoon seem shorter.
There. That's done.
Shall I brush your clothes now,
honey child?
Yes, please.
Do you think they'll keep Daddy
locked up in that place long, Uncle Billy?
No, ma'am.
I'm afraid they won't, honey.
You're afraid?
You don't want my daddy-
Oh, no, no, child.
I expects they take him out pretty soon now.
Last night when I said my prayers...
I asked God
to let Daddy out of there...
and- and I asked him
for a new dress too.
Then I thought maybe
that was too much to ask...
so I told God he didn't have
to bother about the dress.
- Was that right, Uncle Billy?
- Yes, that was right, honey.
But if you want that dress...
I'll kinda slip a little
hint in my prayers tonight.
Now, Uncle Billy, if you
look sad when we get there...
like you did yesterday,
I'll never take you again.
No, ma'am, I won't.
We've got to smile,
so Daddy will think we're happy.
I will, honey. You'll see.
You ready now?
Yes, all ready.
James Henry, you wait here
until we get back.
Yes, sir.
Did you like it, Daddy?
You have charge of Captain Cary's little girl,
haven't you?
Yes, sir.
I is one of his slaves, sir.
- I want to speak to you a moment.
- Yes, sir.
That was lovely, darling.
Come on now, and tell me what you've been doing.
Oh, I sewed up a hole in my dress.
Mrs. Robin let me sweep the stoop.
- Why, you're becoming a regular, little housewife.
- Daddy?
- Hmm?
- When are they gonna let you out?
No, no. Come on now.
Tell me what you've been doing.
Well, there's a little girl
lives across the street...
and she has a pony,
and she let me ride on it.
- That's grand.
- And she gave me some candy, and she's a Yank.
And she said she didn't care
whether I was a rebel or not...
and I said I didn't care
whether she was a Yank.
Even if there is a war,
she was awfully nice to me.
- Daddy?
- Yes.
When she was so nice,
and Colonel Morrison's so nice, and Mrs. Robin...
why do the rest of the people
have to kill each other?
I don't know, honey.
We grown-ups haven't as much
sense as you children.
This isn't money enough,
but it's all I can spare.
I'll give you a letter to him.
He may help you. I don't know.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
You've got four days to try it in.
It's worth taking the chance.
God bless you.
I'll start right now, sir.
- Daddy?
- Yes, dear.
- I don't want to leave.
- Perhaps you'd better.
Tomorrow you can come again.
You're not leaving without
saying good-bye to me, are you?
Oh, no.
I was gonna kiss you good-bye.
Then tomorrow when I come,
I'll do all the talking with you.
Oh, you switch around, eh?
Well, Daddy said you tried to help us,
so I make you my second daddy.
Nothing so nice ever happened to me.
We gotta hurry, missy.
Good-bye, Yankee.
Good-bye, rebel darling.
Good-bye, Daddy.
- God love you, honey.
- I'll come tomorrow.
- All right, sweetheart.
- Good-bye, Massa Cary.
- Good-bye, Billy.
- Good-bye, Colonel Morrison, sir.
- Bye.
- Good-bye, darling.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
Uncle Billy, isn't there any way
we can get them out of there?
Honey, that soldier man
give me some money.
He's gonna write me a letter
to give to a judge up in Washington.
He said there's just one way...
but I don't know if we got
enough money to get there.
Please, sir, how much is the railroad fare
for a colored man to Washington?
Six dollars and 20 cents.
And how much for the little girl, sir?
Ah, she's a little too tall for half fare.
Oh, no, I'm not.
I'm standing on my toes.
This is my right size.
All right.
It'll be $9.60 for you, first class.
Thank you, sir.
- Have you got enough?
- No, child.
It's gonna take more money
than what we got.
How do people get money?
I know how to get some more money.
Come on, honey child.
Help the cause, white folks.
It's for the cause.
- Which cause?
- The-The right cause.
Thank you. Thank you.
I don't put no money
in the Confederate cap.
There you are, boss.
I brung this along just in case.
- Oh, well, that's-
- Thank you.
Here, give me that.
This makes 44, 45, 46, 56.
Bless the Lord. Praise the Lord.
We got enough now,
honey, for railroad fare.
Come on, child.
- You may go in now.
- Thank you, sir.
Come on, Uncle Billy.
Come right in.
Miss Virginia Cary and Uncle Billy?
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir, Mr. President.
How do you do, my dear?
Very nicely. Thank you, sir.
And how are you, Uncle Billy?
Let me see.
Judge Van Allen
told me about this case.
Yes, sir. He's the gentleman
the soldier man sent me to.
Come over here.
Tell me all about it.
There. Now... that's nicer.
My daddy and Colonel Morrison
are in prison...
and they're going to shoot them.
Your father is a captain
in the Confederate Army.
Yes, sir.
Arrested as a spy.
My daddy isn't a spy!
Do you know what a spy is?
I know it's something bad,
because they shoot you for it...
and my daddy
couldn't do anything bad.
I don't see how he could either...
with a little one like you.
Thank you kindly, sir.
Tell me about it.
My daddy went away to the war...
and then the Yankees
came around to our house...
and sometimes
my daddy came home.
- Was he in uniform?
- Yes, sir.
- What color?
- Gray.
I see.
Thank you, sir.
Then there were
so many Yankees around...
my daddy couldn't
come home anymore.
Then they burnt down our house,
and my mommy got sick...
and had to go to bed
in Uncle Billy's cabin.
No, that's yours.
I had the last piece.
That's right.
We had nothing to get her medicine with,
Mr. President.
The soldiers took
most everything we had.
And Mommy kept asking
for my daddy.
All the time she'd ask.
No, that's mine.
You had the last piece.
- I beg your pardon.
- You forgot. That's all.
So Uncle Billy went
and brought my daddy back home.
The next day, my mommy went away.
There, there. Don't cry.
You're a great big girl.
You mustn't cry.
- I won't.
- What happened next?
Then the Yankees came,
and my daddy had to hide in the garret.
Then Colonel Morrison came in.
He talked to me.
He's awfully nice.
He has a little girl, too,just my age.
Then he found Daddy,
and Daddy told him...
about wanting to take me to my
Aunt Caroline in Richmond...
so I could get enough to eat.
That's why the colonel give
Massa Cary the pass, sir-
just so he could bring Miss Virgie
where she could be taken care of.
I see. Now, on this trip...
before your daddy was captured...
did he write down anything
on paper or anything?
- No, sir.
- Did he ever stop and look at the Yankee soldiers...
or count them
or look at the cannons?
No, sir. He told me
that if we got to Richmond...
and anyone asked me
what I had seen...
I was in honor bound
not to tell them.
- He told you that?
- Yes, sir.
Because Colonel Morrison
asked him not to see anything...
and my daddy gave his word,
and they shook hands.
- John.
- Yes, Mr. President?
- Mr. President?
- Yes, Miss Virgie.
You won't let them shoot my daddy
and Colonel Morrison, will you?
- Rush this by special courier to General Grant.
- Yes, Mr. President.
- Is this yours?
- No, it's yours.
I had the last piece.
There, there now.
All your terrible fears are over.
Your father and Colonel Morrison
are going free.
