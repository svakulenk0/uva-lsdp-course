LINCOLN
Transcript and sync: jcdr
HAROLD GREEN:  Some of us
was in the Second Kansas Colored.
We fought the rebs at
Jenkins’ Ferry last April,
just after they’d killed every Negro
soldier they captured at Poison Springs.
So at Jenkins’ Ferry,
we decided warn’t taking no reb prisoners.
And we didn’t leave a one of ‘em alive.
The ones of us that didn’t die that day,
we joined up with the116th U.S.
Colored, sir.
From Camp Nelson Kentucky.
LINCOLN: What’s your name, soldier?
Private Harold Green, sir.
I’m Corporal Ira Clark, sir.
Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry.
We’re waiting over there.
We’re leaving our horses behind,
and shipping out with the 24th Infantry
for the assault next week on Wilmington.
LINCOLN: How long’ve you been a soldier?
Two year, sir.
LINCOLN: Second Kansas Colored Infantry,
they fought bravely at Jenkins’ Ferry.
That’s right, sir.
They killed a thousand
rebel soldiers, sir.
They were very brave.
And making three dollars less
each month than white soldiers.
Us 2nd Kansas boys...
Another three dollars subtracted
from our pay our pay for our uniforms.
That was true, yes sir, but....
Equal pay now, but still no
commissioned Negro officers.
LINCOLN: I am aware of that, Corporal Clark.
Yes, sir, that’s good you’re aware, sir.
It’s only that...
LINCOLN: Do you think
the Wilmington attack...
Now that white people have
accustomed themselves
to seeing Negro men with guns,
fighting on their behalf,
and now that they can tolerate
Negro soldiers getting equal pay,
maybe in a few years they can abide the
idea of Negro lieutenants and captains.
In fifty years, maybe a Negro colonel.
In a hundred years... the vote.
What’ll you do after the war,
Corporal Clark?
CLARK: Work, sir.
Perhaps you’ll hire me.
Perhaps I will.
But you should know, sir, that I get sick
at the smell of boot black
and I cannot cut hair.
I’ve yet to find a man could cut
mine so it’d make any difference.
CLARK: You got springy hair for a white man.
Yes, I do. My last
barber hanged himself.
And the one before that.
Left me his scissors in his will.
– FIRST WHITE SOLDIER: President Lincoln, sir?
– Evening, boys.
SECOND WHITE SOLDIER:
We saw you at, um, we...
– We were at, uh, at...
– We was at Gettysburg!
You boys fight at Gettysburg?
Naw, we didn’t fight there.
We just signed up last month.
We saw him two years ago
at the cemetery dedication.
Yeah, we heard you speak,
we, uh... ah damn, damn damn!
Uh, hey, how tall are you anyway?!
Jeez, shut up!
Could you hear what I said?
FWS: No, sir, not much.
It was....
“Four score and seven years ago,
our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation,
conceived in liberty and
dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.
That’s good, thank you.
FWS: “Now we are engaged in a great civil war,
testing whether that nation
or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated can long endure.
We are-we are-we are met
on a great battlefield of that war.”
That's good, thank you.
SWS: “We have come to dedicate
a portion of that field
as a final resting place for
those who here gave their lives
that that nation might live.
– It is...”.
– His uncles,
they died on the second day of fighting.
I know the last part. “It is...
–
– it is rather...
LINCOLN: Boys, best go and
find your company. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
God bless you.
LINCOLN: God bless you too.
CLARK: “That we here highly resolve
that these dead shall
not have died in vain.
That this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom,
and that government of the
people, by the people,
for the people,
shall not perish from the earth.
LINCOLN: It’s nighttime.
The ship’s moved by some terrible
power, at a terrific speed.
Though it’s imperceptible in the darkness,
I have an intuition that we’re
headed towards a shore.
No one else seems to be
aboard the vessel and I...
I'm kinny aware of my aloneness.
LINCOLN: I could be bounded in a nutshell
and count myself a king of infinite space
were it not that I have bad dreams.
I reckon it’s the speed
that’s strange to me,
I’m used to going a deliberate pace.
I should spare you Mary,
I shouldn’t tell you my dreams.
MARY: I don’t want to be spared if you aren’t!
And you spare me nothing.
MARY: Perhaps it’s...
it’s the assault on Wilmington port.
You dream about the ship
before a battle, usually.
How’s the coconut?
Beyond description.
Almost two years, nothing mends.
Another casualty of the war.
Who wants to listen to a useless woman
grouse about her carriage accident?
– I do.
– Stuff!
You tell me dreams, that’s all,
I’m your soothsayer,
that’s all I am anymore,
I’m not to be trusted...
Even if it wasn’t a carriage accident,
even if it was an attempted assassination.
– It was most probably an ass...
– MARY: It was an assassin,
whose intended target was you.
How’s the plans coming along
for the big shindy?
I don’t want to talk about parties.
MARY : You don’t care about parties.
Not much but they’re a
necessary hindrance.
I know...
I know what it’s about, the ship.
It's not Wilmington Port,
it’s not a military campaign!
It’s the amendment to abolish slavery!
Why else would you force me to invite
demented radicals into my home?
MARY: You’re gonna try to get the amendment
passed in the House of Representatives,
before the term ends,
before the Inauguration.
Don’t spend too much money
on the flub dubs.
No one’s loved as much as you,
no one’s ever been loved
so much by the people,
you might do anything now.
Don’t, don’t waste that power on an
amendment bill that’s sure to defeat.
MARY: Did you remember Robert’s
coming home for the reception?
I knew you’d forget.
That’s the ship you’re sailing on.
The Thirteenth Amendment.
MARY: You needn’t tell me I’m right,
I know I am.
Oh it’s late, Mrs. Keckley.
She needs this for the grand reception.
It’s slow work.
Good night.
Did you tell her a dream?
– TAD: Papa?
– LINCOLN: Hmm?
TAD: Papa, I wanna see Willie.
LINCOLN: Me too, Taddie. But we can’t.
TAD: Why not?
LINCOLN: Willie’s gone.
Three years now. He’s gone.
Instrumental rendition of
“We Are Coming Father Abra’am.”
The part assigned to me
is to raise the flag,
which, if there be no fault
in the machinery, I will do,
and when up, it will be for
the people to keep it up.
That's my speech.
AUDIENCE:We are coming Father Abra’am
three hundred thousand more
From Mississippi’s winding stream
and from New England’s shore
We leave our plows and workshops
our wives and children dear
SEWARD: Even if every Republican
in the House votes yes,
far from guaranteed, since when has
our party unanimously supported anything?
but say all our fellow
Republicans vote for it,
We’d still be twenty votes short.
– Only twenty?
– Only twenty!
We can find twenty votes.
Twenty House Democrats
who’ll vote to abolish slavery,
in my opinion...
– To which I always listen.
– Or pretend to.
– With all three of my ears.
We’ll win the war soon.
It’s inevitable, isn’t it?
LINCOLN: Ain’t won yet.
You’ll begin your second term
with semi-divine stature.
Imagine the possibilities
peace will bring!
Why tarnish your invaluable luster
with a battle in the House?
It’s a rats’ nest in there,
the same gang of talentless
hicks and hacks who
rejected the amendment
ten months ago. We’ll lose.
I like our chances now.
SEWARD: Well, consider the
obstacles we would face.
The aforementioned two-thirds majority
needed to pass an amendment.
We have a Republican majority,
but barely more than fifty percent.
LINCOLN: Fifty-six.
We need Democratic support.
There’s none to be had.
Since the House last voted on
the amendment, there’s been an election.
Sixty-four Democrats lost their
House seats in November, that’s...
sixty-four Democrats looking for work
come March
– I know.
They don’t need to worry
about re-election,
they can vote however it suits ‘em.
But we can’t, um...
buy the vote for the amendment,
it's too important.
LINCOLN: I said nothing of buying anything.
We need twenty votes was all I said.
Start of my second term,
plenty of positions to fill.
NICOLAY: Mr. President, may I present Mr.
and Mrs. Jolly who’ve come from Missouri to...
MR JOLLY: From Jeff City, President.
LINCOLN: Mr. Jolly.
Ma'am.
This by the fire’s
Secretary of State Seward.
Jeff City.
I heard tell once of a...
Jefferson City lawyer,
who had a parrot
that’d wake him each morning,
crying out, “Today is the day
the world shall end
as scripture has foretold.”
And one day...
the lawyer shot him
for the sake of peace
and quiet, I presume,
thus fulfilling, for the
bird at least, its prophecy.
There’s only one tollbooth in Jeff City,
to the southwest,
and this man Heinz Sauermagen from Rolla
been in illegal possession
for near two year, since
your man General Schofield
set him up there.
But President Monroe give
that toll gate to my granpap
and Quincy Adams...
give my pap a letter saying
it’s our’n for keeps.
Mrs. Jolly got the...
Show Mr. Lincoln the Quincy Adams letter.
LINCOLN: That’s unnecessary, Mrs. Jolly.
Just tell me what you want from me.
Mr. Jolly’s emphysema
don’t care for cigars.
Madame. Do you know about the proposed
Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution?
Yes sir, everybody knows of it.
The President favors it.
– But do you?
– We do.
You know that it abolishes slavery?
Yes sir. I know it.
And is that why you favor it?
What I favor is ending the war.
Once’t we do away with slavery,
the rebs will quit fighting,
since slavery’s what they’re fighting for.
Mr. Lincoln, you always say so.
MRS JOLLY: With the amendment,
slavery’s ended and they’ll give up,
the war can finish then.
If the war finished first,
before we end slavery,
would...
– President Lincoln says
the war won’t stop unless
we finish slavery...
– But...
if it did.
The South is exhausted.
SEWARD: If they run out of bullets and men,
would you still want your, uh...
Who’s your representative?
LINCOLN: Jeff City? That’s, uh,
Congressman Burton?
“Beanpole” Burton. I mean,
Josiah Burton, yes.
LINCOLN: Republican. Undecided on the
question of the amendment, I believe.
Perhaps you could call on him
and inform him of your enthusiasm.
– Yeah...
– SEWARD: Madam?
If the rebels surrender next week,
would you, at the end of this month,
want Congressman Burton to vote
for the Thirteenth Amendment?
If that was how it was,
no more war and all,
I reckon Mr. Jolly’d much prefer not
to have Congress pass the amendment.
SEWARD: And, uh... why’s that?
Niggers.
MRS. JOLLY: If he don’t have to let
some Alabama coon come up to Missouri,
steal his chickens and his job,
he’d much prefer that.
The people! I begin to see why you’re
in such a great hurry to put it through.
Would you let me study this letter,
sir, about the tollbooth?
LINCOLN: Come back to me in the morning,
and we’ll consider what the law says.
LINCOLN: And be sure to visit “Beanpole”,
and tell him that you support
passage of the Amendment,
as a military necessity.
NICOLAY: Thank you.
LINCOLN: Oh, Nicolay,
when you have a moment...
If procuring votes with offers
of employment is what you intend,
I’ll fetch a friend from Albany
who can supply the skulking men
gifted at this kind of shady work.
Spare me the indignity of
actually speaking to Democrats.
Spare you the exposure and liability.
LINCOLN: Pardon me, that’s a distress signal,
which I am bound by
solemn oath to respond to.
Tom Pendel took away the glass camera
plates of slaves Mr. Gardner sent over
because Tom says mama says
they’re too distressing, but...
You had nightmares all night,
mama’s right to...
I’ll have worse nightmares, if you
don’t let me look at the plates again!
LINCOLN: Perhaps.
SEWARD: We can't afford a single
defection from anyone in our party,
not even a single Republican
absent when they vote.
You know who you’ve got to see.
Send over to Blair House.
Ask Preston Blair can I call on him
around five o’clock.
God help you.
God alone knows what
he’ll ask you to give him.
If the Blairs tell ‘em to, no Republican
will balk at voting for the amendment.
MONTGOMERY BLAIR: No conservative
Republican is what you mean.
PRESTON BLAIR: All Republicans
ought to be conservative,
I founded this party
in my own goddamned home
to be a conservative antislavery party,
not a hobbyhorse for
goddamned radical abolitionists.
ELIZABETH BLAIR: Damp down the
dyspepsia, daddy, you’ll frighten the child.
MONTGOMERY: You need us to keep the
conservative side of the party in the traces
while you diddle the radicals and
bundle up with Thaddeus Stevens’s gang,
you need our help.
– Yes, sir, I do.
– Well, what do we get?
– Whoo! Blunt!
Your manners, Monty,
must be why Mr. Lincoln...
pushed you out of his cabinet.
– PRESTON: He was pushed out.
– I wasn’t pushed.
– Oh of course you weren’t.
– MONTGOMERY: I agreed to resign.
– PRESTON: He was pushed out
to placate the goddamn
radical abolishonists!
ELIZABETH: Oh Daddy, please!
Daddy.
Oh. You don’t mind, boy, do you?
He spends his days with soldiers.
– They taught me a song!
– Did they?
PRESTON: Soldiers know
all manner of songs.
PRESTON: How’s your brother Bob?
He’s at school now, but he’s coming
to visit in four days. For the shindy!
PRESTON: t school? Ain’t that fine!
Good he’s not in the army!
TAD: He wants to be,
but mama said he can’t...
Dangerous life, soldiering.
Your mama is wise to
keep him clean out of that.
Now... your daddy knows that what I want,
in return for all the help I give him,
is to go down to Richmond like he said
I could, as soon as Savannah fell,
and talk to Jefferson Davis.
PRESTON: Give me terms I can
offer to Jefferson Davis
to start negotiating for peace,
he’ll talk to me!
Conservative members of your party
want you to listen to overtures
from Richmond. That above all!
They’ll vote for this rash
and dangerous amendment
only if every other
possibility is exhausted.
Our Republicans ain’t abolitionists.
We can’t tell our people they can vote yes
on abolishing slavery unless
at the same time we can tell ‘em
that you’re seeking a negotiated peace.
ELIZABETH: Leo, it’s a
hundred miles to Richmond.
Get him drunk so he can sleep.
– Yes ma'am.
Here, daddy.
– Oh. Thank you.
– Let’s fix this up...
– Where’s my hat?
– Leo has your hat.
All right?
Go make peace.
Thunder forth, God of War!
STANTON: We’ll commence our
assault on Wilmington from the sea.
Why is this burnt?
Was the boy playing with it?
LINCOLN: It got took by
breeze several nights back.
This is an official War Department map!
SEWARD: And the entire cabinet’s
waiting to hear what it portends.
WELLES: A bombardment.
From the largest fleet
the Navy has ever assembled.
LINCOLN: Old Neptune,
shake thy hoary locks!
WELLES: Fifty-eight ships are underway,
of every tonnage and firing range.
STANTON: We’ll keep up a steady barrage.
Our first target is Fort Fisher.
It defends Wilmington Port.
JAMES SPEED: A steady barrage?
A hundred shells a minute.
Till they surrender.
– WILLIAM FESSENDEN: Dear God.
– WELLES: Yes, yes.
LINCOLN: Wilmington’s their
last open seaport. Therefore...
STANTON: Wilmington falls,
Richmond falls after.
SEWARD: And the war is done.
JOHN USHER: Then why, if I may ask,
are we not concentrating
the nation’s attention on Wilmington?
Why, instead, are we
reading in the Herald,
that the anti-slavery amendment
is being precipitated
onto the House floor for debate?
Because your eagerness, in what seems
an unwarranted intrusion of the Executive
into Legislative prerogatives,
is compelling it to it’s...
to what’s likely to be
its premature demise.
You hear?
You signed the Emancipation
Proclamation, you’ve done
all that can be expected.
– The Emancipation Proclamation’s
merely a war measure.
After the war the courts will make
a meal of it.
– When Edward Bates
was Attorney General,
he felt confident in it enough
to allow you to sign.
– Different lawyers, different opinions.
It frees slaves as a military
exigent, not in any other...
LINCOLN: I don’t recall Edward
Bates being any too certain
about the legality of my Proclamation...
just it wasn’t downright criminal.
Somewhere’s in between.
Back when I rode the legal
circuit in Illinois,
I defended a woman from Metamora named
Melissa Goings, 77 years old.
They said she murdered
her husband, he was 83.
He was choking her, and, uh, she
grabbed a hold of a stick of fire wood and
fractured his skull, ‘n he died.
In his will he wrote:
“I expect she has killed me.
If I get over it, I will have revenge.
No one was keen to see her convicted,
he was that kind of husband.
I asked the prosecuting attorney
if I might have a short conference
with my client.
And she and I
went into a room in the courthouse,
but I alone emerged.
The window in the room
was found to be wide open,
It was believed the old lady
may have climbed out of it.
I told the bailiff...
Right before I left her in the room,
she asked me where she could get
a good drink of water,
and I told her Tennessee.
Mrs. Goings was seen no more in Metamora.
Enough justice had been done.
They even forgave the bondsman her bail.
– JOHN USHER: I’m afraid I don’t see...
– LINCOLN: I decided
that the Constitution gives me war powers,
but no one knows just exactly
what those powers are.
Some say they don’t exist.
I don’t know. I decided,
I needed them to exist to uphold
my oath to protect the Constitution,
which I decided meant that I could
take the rebels’ slaves from ‘em as
property confiscated in war.
That might recommend to suspicion
that I agree with the rebs
that their slaves are property in
the first place. Of course I don’t.
I never have, I’m glad to see any man
free, and if calling a man property, or
war contraband, does the trick,
why I caught at the opportunity.
Now here’s where it gets truly slippery.
I use the law allowing for
the seizure of property
in a war knowing it applies only to
the property of governments and
citizens of belligerent nations.
But the South ain’t a nation.
That’s why I can’t negotiate with ’em.
So if in fact the Negroes are
property according to law,
have I the right to take the
rebels’ property from ‘em,
if I insist they’re rebels only,
and not citizens of a belligerent country?
And slipperier still: I maintain it ain’t
our actual Southern states in rebellion,
but only the rebels
living in those states,
the laws of which states remain in force.
The laws of which states remain in force.
That means, that since it’s
states’ laws that determine
whether Negroes can be sold
as slaves, as property,
the Federal government
doesn’t have a say in that,
at least not yet,
then Negroes in those states
are slaves, hence property, hence
my war powers allow me to confiscate‘em
as such, so I confiscated ‘em.
LINCOLN:: But if
I’m a respecter of states’ laws,
how then can I legally free‘em
with my Proclamation as I done,
unless I’m cancelling states’ laws?
I felt the war demanded it.
my oath demanded it,
I felt right with myself, and I
hoped it was legal to do it
I’m hoping still.
Two years ago I proclaimed
these people emancipated,
" then, thenceforward and forever free.”
But let’s say the courts decide
I had no authority to do it.
They might well decide that.
Say there’s no amendment
abolishing slavery.
Say it’s after the war,
and I can no longer use my war powers
to just ignore the courts’ decisions,
like I sometimes felt I had to do,
Might those people I freed
be ordered back into slavery?
That’s why I’d like to get the Thirteenth
Amendment through the House,
and on its way to ratification
by the states,
wrap the whole slavery thing up,
forever and aye, as soon as I’m able,
Now! End of this month!
And I’d like you to stand behind me,
like my cabinet’s most always done.
As the preacher said, I could
write shorter sermons but
once I start I get too lazy to stop.
JOHN USHER: It seems to me,
sir, you’re describing precisely
the sort of dictator the Democrats
have been howling about.
JAMES SPEED: Dictators
aren’t susceptible to law.
USHER: Neither is he!
He just said as much!
Ignoring the courts,
twisting meanings, what...
what reins him in from, from...
– Well,
the people do that, I suppose.
I signed the Emancipation
Proclamation a year and half,
before my second election,
I felt I was within my power to do it.
However I also felt that I might be
wrong about that.
I knew the people would tell me,
I gave ‘em a year and half to think
about it, and they reelected me.
And come February the first,
I intend to sign the Thirteenth Amendment.
LINCOLN: Well, Mr. Representative Ashley!
Tell us the news from the Hill.
– JAMES ASHLEY: Ah! Well, news...
– Why for instance is this thus,
and what is the reason for this thusness?
James, we want you to bring the anti-
slavery amendment to the floor for debate.
– Excuse me, what?
– Immediately.
You are the amendment’s manager,
are you not?
I am, of course, but...
And we’re counting on robust
radical support, so tell Mr. Stevens
we expect him to put his back into it.
It’s not going to be easy,
but we trust...
– It’s impossible.
No, I am sorry, no, we can’t organize
anything immediately in the House.
I have been canvassing the
Democrats since the election,
in case any of them softened
after they got walloped. But
they have stiffened if anything,
Mr. Secretary,
there aren’t nearly enough votes...
– LINCOLN: We’re whalers, Mr. Ashley!
Whalers? As in, um... whales?
LINCOLN: We’ve been chasing
this whale for a long time.
We’ve finally placed a harpoon
in the monster’s back.
It’s in, James, it’s in!
We finish the deed now, we can’t wait!
Or with one flop of his tail,
he’ll smash the boat
and send us all to eternity.
SEWARD: On the 31st
of this month. Of this year.
Put the amendment up for a vote.
BLUFF WADE: Whalers?
ASHLEY: That’s what he said.
The man’s never been near
a whale ship in his life!
Withdraw radical support,
force him to abandon this scheme,
whatever he’s up to.
He-He... He drags his feet about
everything, Lincoln. Why this urgency?
We got it through the Senate without
difficulty because we had the numbers.
Come December you’ll have
the same in the House.
The amendment’ll be the
easy work of ten minutes.
ASA VINTNER LITTON: He’s using
the threat of the amendment
to frighten the rebels
into an immediate surrender.
SCHUYLER COLFAX: I imagine
we’d rejoice to see that.
Will you rejoice, when the Southern states
have re-joined the Union pell-mell as
Lincoln intends them to, and one by one
each refuses to ratify the amendment?
If we pass it, which we won’t.
Why are we... co-operating with-with him?
We all know what he’s doing,
and we all know what he’ll do.
We can’t offer up abolition’s best
legal prayer to his games and tricks.
He’s said he’d welcome the South
back with all its slaves in chains.
Three years ago he said that.
To calm the border states
when we were...
– VOICE: I don't.
THADDEUS STEVENS: You said
“we all know what he’ll do.” I don’t know.
– LITTON: You know he isn’t to be trusted.
– Trust? Oh...
I’m sorry, I was under the misapprehension
your chosen profession was politics.
I’ve never trusted the President.
I never trust anyone.
But hasn’t he surprised you?
LITTON: No, Mr. Stevens, he hasn’t.
Nothing surprises you, Asa.
Therefore nothing about
you is surprising.
Perhaps that is why your constituents
did not re-elect you to the coming term.
It’s late, I’m old, I’m going home.
STEVENS : Lincoln the inveterate
dawdler, Lincoln the Southerner,
Lincoln the capitulating compromiser,
our... adversary and....
leader of the god forsaken
Republican Party, our party.
Abraham Lincoln has
asked us to work with him
to accomplish the death
of slavery in America.
Retain, even in opposition,
your capacity for astonishment.
The President is never to be mentioned.
Nor I. You’re paid for your discretion.
W.N. BILBO: Hell, you can have that for
nothin’, what we need money for is bribes.
It’d speed things up.
SEWARD: No. Nothing strictly illegal.
ROBERT LATHAM: It’s not illegal to bribe
Congressmen. They starve otherwise.
I have explained to
Mr. Bilbo and Mr. Latham
that we’re offering patronage
jobs to the Dems who vote yes.
Jobs and nothing more.
– SEWARD: That’s correct.
BILBO: Congressmen come cheap!
Few thousand bucks’ll buy you all you need.
The President would be unhappy
to hear you did that.
Well, will he be unhappy if we lose?
The money I managed to
raise for this endeavor
is only for your fees, your
food, and lodgings, sir.
Uh huh.
If that squirrel-infested attic you’ve
quartered us in’s any measure,
you ain’t raised much.
Shall we get to work?
COLFAX: The House
recognizes Fernando Wood,
the honorable representative
from New York.
FERNANDO WOOD: Estimable colleagues.
Two bloody years ago this month,
his Highness King Abraham
Africanus the First,
our Great Usurping Caesar,
violator of habeas corpus
and freedom of the press,
abuser of states’ rights...
HIRAM PRICE: If Lincoln really
were a tyrant, Mr. Wood,
he’d’a had your empty head
impaled on a pike!
And the country better for it!
Your radical republican autocrat
ruling by fiat and martial law,
affixed his name to his on a heinous
and illicit Emancipation Proclamation,
promising it would hasten
the end of the war,
which yet rages on and on.
WOOD : He claimed, as tyrants do,
that the war’s emergencies
permitted him to turn our army...
LATHAM: The New York
delegation’s looking decidedly uninspired.
.. and radical Republicanism’s
abolitionist fanaticism!
WOOD : His Emancipation Proclamation
has obliterated millions of dollars...
RICHARD SCHELL: Over in Pennsylvania...
who’s the sweaty man eating his thumb?
LATHAM: Unknown to me.
Seems jumpy.
Perhaps he’ll jump.
But all that was not
enough for this dictator,
who now seeks to insinuate...
BILBO: Jesus!
When’s this son-of liberty
sonofabitch gonna sit down?
SCHELL: John Ellis is going to
break his watch if he doesn’t stop.
WOOD : We are once again asked...
nay, commanded to consider a
proposed thirteenth amendment.
Which, if passed, shall
set at immediate liberty
four million coloreds while manacling
the limbs of the white race in America
If it is passed.
But it shall not pass!
What’s more interesting is how dismal
and disgruntled Mr. Yeaman appears.
WOOD : Every
member of this House....
LATHAM: He should be
cheering right now, but...
W.N. BILBO: Looks like
he ate a bad oyster.
WOOD : .. and the constituents
which it serves shall oppose!
STEVENS: A point of order,
Mr. Speaker, if you please?
Mr. Speaker, I still have the floor,
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania
is out of order!
– STEVENS: When will Mr. Wood
conclude his interminable gabble?
Some of us breathe oxygen,
and we find the mephitic
fumes of his oratory
a lethal challenge to
our pulmonary capacities.
WOOD: We shall oppose this amendment,
and any legislation that
so affronts natural law,
insulting to God as to man!
Congress must never declare equal
those whom God created unequal!
STEVENS: Slavery is the only insult
to natural law, you fatuous nincompoop!
GEORGE PENDLETON :
ORDEEER!
Procedure! Mr. Speaker,
Mr. Wood has the floor!
Instruct us, Oh Great Commoner,
what is unnatural, in your opinion?
Niggrahs casting ballots?
Niggrah representatives,
is that natural, Stevens?
Intermarriage?
STEVENS: What violates natural law, slavery,
and you, Pendleton, you insult God!
You unnatural noise.
JAMES ASHLEY: Mr. Coffax,
please, use your gavel.
– ASHLEY: You are out of order!
– COFFAX: Order in the Chamber!
ASHLEY: Instruct the sergeant
of arms to suppress this!
ASHLEY: We are in session!
TOM PENDEL: Please don’t encourage this!
Don’t encourage this!
TAD: You’re back, you’re back,
you’re back, you’re back!
I am.
Your goat got big.
Here, help me get one
of these to my room.
Is she in there?
TAD: She’s asleep, probably.
– You need help, sir? I can...
– No, sir, I don’t. No.
– PETITIONER: I can...
– ROBERT: No.
Could you bring your pa this letter
I writ about my insolvency proceedings?
ROBERT: You deliver your
own goddamned petition...
TAD: .. ‘cause there’s a new book that
Sam Beckwith says is about finches,
and finches’ beaks, about how they...
He’s here, Mrs. Cuthbert!
He’s here!
– Robbie...
– Hi, ma.
– Oh, Robbie...
– Hey.
Robbie. Oh!
MARY: What...?
You’re only staying a few days.
Why’d you pack all of that?
Well, I don’t know how long I’m...
Go tell your father Robert’s home!
Mr. Nicolay says daddy’s
secluded with Mr. Blair.
Tell him anyway.
– You forget to eat, exactly like him.
– No...
You’ll linger a few days extra, after the
reception, before you go back to school.
Well, I don’t know if I’m
gonna go back to s...
We’ll fatten you up before
you return to Boston.
– All right, mama.
– All right.
Oh Robbie...
PRESTON BLAIR: Jefferson Davis
is sending three delegates:
Stephens, Hunter and Campbell.
Vice President of the Confederacy,
their former Secretary of State,
and their Assistant Secretary of War.
They’re coming in earnest
to propose peace.
I know this is unwelcome news for you.
Now hear me.
I went to Richmond to talk to traitors,
to smile at and plead with traitors,
because it’ll be spring in two months,
the roads’ll be passable,
the Spring slaughter commences.
Four bloody Springs now!
Think of my Frank,
who you’ve taken to your heart,
how you’ll blame yourself
if the war takes my son
as it’s taken multitudes of sons.
Think of all the boys who’ll die
if you don’t make peace.
You must talk with these men!
I intend to, Preston.
And in return, I must ask you...
– No, this is not horsetrading,
this is life!
– LINCOLN: NOT NOW!
LINCOLN: Bob. I’m sorry.
LINCOLN: Welcome home.
– ROBERT: Thank you.
You’re looking fit, Robert.
Harvard agrees with you.
–  Mr. Blair.
– Preston, son.
LINCOLN: If you just give us
a moment please, Robert. Thank you.
I will procure your votes for you,
as I promised, sir.
You’ve always kept your word to me.
Those Southern men are coming.
I beg you, in the name
of Gentle Christ, sir.
LINCOLN: I understand.
Talk peace with these men.
I understand, Preston.
LATHAM: We have
one abstention so far.
SCHELL:
SHELL: He’d like to be Federal Revenue
Assessor for the Fifth District of Pennsylvania.
LATHAM: So the total of representatives voting
three weeks from today is reduced to 182,
which means 122 yes votes to reach
the requisite two thirds of the House.
Assuming all Republicans
vote for the amendment.
Then, despite our abstention,
to reach a two-thirds majority
we remain 20 yeses short.
LATHAM : For which we’re seeking
from among 64 lame duck Democrats.
Fully 39 of these we deem
unredeemable no votes.
BILBO: The kind that hates niggers,
hates God for making niggers.
LATHAM: The Good Lord on High
would despair of their souls.
SEWARD: Thank you for that
pithy explanation, Mr. Bilbo.
SCHELL: We’ve abandoned these 39
to the Devil that possesses them.
SCHELL: The remaining lame ducks,
on whom we’ve been working with a purpose.
Charles Hanson.
Giles Stuart.
Nelson Merrick.
Homer Benson.
And lastly...
BILBO: Clay Hawkins. Of Ohio.
CLAY HAWKINS: T-tax collector
for the Western Reserve, it...
Th-that pays handsomely.
BILBO: Don't just reach for the highest
branches, they sway in every breeze.
Assistant Port Inspector of Marlston
looks like the ticket to me.
HAWKINS: Uh, boats,
they-they make me sick.
So just stand on the dock.
Let the Assistant Assistant Port
Inspector’s stomach go weak.
SEWARD: And lastly, Democratic yes
vote number six. Hawkins from Ohio.
– LINCOLN; Six.
– SEWARD: Well, thus far.
SEWARD: Plus Graylor’s abstention.
From tiny acorns and so on.
– LINCOLN: Wha’d Hawkins get?
NICOLAY: Postmaster of
the Millersburg Post Office.
He’s selling himself cheap, ain’t he?
SEWARD: Aye, he wanted tax
collector of the Western Reserve,
a first-term congressman
who couldn’t manage reelection,
I felt it unseemly and they
bargained him down to Postmaster.
Scatter ‘em over several rounds
of appointments, so no one notices,
and burn this ledger,
please, after you’re done.
LINCOLN: Time for my public opinion bath.
Might as well let ‘em in.
LINCOLN: Seven yeses
with Mr. Ellis. Thirteen to go.
One last item, an absurdity, but...
My associates report that
among the Representatives,
a fantastical rumor’s bruited about,
which I immediately disavowed,
that you’d allowed bleary old
Preston Blair to sojourn to Richmond
to invite Jeff Davis to send commissioners
up to Washington with a peace plan.
I, of course, told them you would never..
Not without consulting me, you wouldn’t...
Because why on earth would you?
ALEXANDER STEPHENS:
Much obliged.
SEWARD: Why wasn’t I consulted?!
I’m Secretary of State!
You... you-you informally
send a reactionary dottard to...
What will happen, do you imagine,
when these peace commissioners arrive?
– We’ll hear ‘em out.
– Oh, splendid!
And next the Democrats will
invite ‘em up to hearings on the Hill,
and the newspapers,
well, the newspapers
the newspapers will ask
“why risk enraging the Confederacy
over the issue of slavery
when they’re here to make peace?”
We’ll lose every Democrat we’ve got,
more than likely conservative Republicans
will join ‘em, and all our work,
all our preparing the ground for
the vote, laid waste, for naught.
The Blairs have promised support for the
amendment if we listen to these people.
Oh, the Blairs promise, do they?
You think they’ll keep their promise
once we have heard these delegates
and refused them?
Which we will have to do,
since their proposal most certainly will
be predicated on keeping their slaves!
What hope for any
Democratic votes, Willum,
if word gets out that I’ve
refused a chance to end the war?
You think word won’t get out?
In Washington?
It’s either the amendment or this
Confederate peace, you cannot have both.
“If you can look into the seeds of time,
and say which grain will grow and
which will not, speak then to me...”
SEWARD: Oh, disaster.
This is a disaster!
LINCOLN: Time is a great
thickener of things, Willum.
Yes, I suppose it is.
Actually I have no idea
what you mean by that.
Get me thirteen votes.
Them fellers from Richmond ain’t here yit.
ROBERT: You drafted
half the men in Boston!
What do you think their
families think about me?
The only reason they don’t
throw things and spit on me
is ‘cause you’re so popular.
I can’t concentrate on-on
British mercantile law,
I don’t care about British mercantile law.
I might not even want to be a lawyer.
It’s a sturdy profession,
and a useful one.
Yes, and I want to be useful,
but now, not afterwards!
I ain’t wearing them things,
Mr. Slade, they never fit right.
The missus will have you wear ‘em.
Don’t think about leaving ‘em.
You’re delaying,
that’s your favorite tactic.
You won’t tell me no, but the war will be
over in a month, and you know it will!
LINCOLN: I’ve found that prophesying is
one of life’s less prophet-able occupations.
TAD: Why do some slaves
cost more than others?
Ah, if they’re still young and healthy,
if the women can still conceive,
they’ll pay more.
– Put ‘em back in the box, you scoundrel.
We’ll return them to Mr. Gardner’s
studio day after next.
Be careful with‘em, now.
These things should’ve stayed on the calf.
TAD: When you were a slave,
Mr. Slade, did they beat you?
SLADE: I was born a free man.
Nobody beat me except
I beat them right back.
Mr. Lincoln, could you come with me...
Mrs. Keckley was a slave.
Ask her if she was beaten.
– TAD: Were you?
– Tad!
MRS. KEKLEY: I was beaten with a fire
shovel when I was younger than you.
You should go to Mrs. Lincoln.
She’s in Willie’s room.
ROBERT: She never goes in there.
JOHN HAY: The reception line
is already stretching out the door.
See, I’ll be the only man over
fifteen and under sixty-five
in this whole place not in uniform.
I’m under fifteen.
MARY: My head hurts so.
I prayed for death
the night Willie died.
The headaches are how
I know I didn’t get my wish.
How to endure the long afternoon
that go deep into the night.
LINCOLN: I know.
Trying not to think about him.
How will I manage?
– Somehow you will.
– Somehow.
MARY: Somehow. Somehow. Somehow...
MARY: Every party, every...
And now...
Four years more in this
terrible house... reproaching us.
He was a very sick little boy.
We should’ve cancelled
that reception, shouldn’t we?
– We didn’t know how sick he was.
– I knew, I knew...
I saw that night he was dying.
Three years ago, the war was going
so badly, and we had to put on a face.
– But I... saw Willie was dying.
– Molly.
– I saw him.
– Listen.
LINCLON: It’s too hard.
LINCOLN: Too hard.
WILLIAM SLADE: She’s just ten
feet yonder. I’d like to keep my job.
MARY: Senator Sumner,
it has been much too long.
CHARLES SUMNER: “Oh, who can
look on that celestial face and..."
– And...?
– James Ashley, ma’am,
– we’ve met several times.
– Praise Heavens, praise Heavens,
just when I had abandoned
hope of amusement,
it’s the Chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee!
THADDEUS STEVENS:
Mrs. Lincoln.
Madame President if you please.
Oh, don’t convene another
subcommittee to investigate me, sir!
I’m teasing! Smile, Senator Wade.
I believe I am smiling, Mrs. Lincoln.
STEVENS: As long as your household
accounts are in order, Madame,
we’ll have no need to investigate them.
You have always taken such a lively,
even prosecutorial interest
in my household accounts.
Your household accounts
have always been so interesting.
Yes, thank you, it’s true,
the miracles I have wrought out
of fertilizer bills and cutlery
invoices, but I had to!
Four years ago, when the President
and I arrived, this was pure pigsty.
Tobacco stains in the turkey carpets.
Mushrooms, green as the moon,
sprouting from the ceilings!
And a pauper’s pittance
allotted for improvements.
As if your committee joined
with all of Washington awaiting,
in what you anticipated
would be our comfort in squalor,
further proof that my husband
and I were prairie primitives,
unsuited to the position
to which an error of the people,
a flaw in the democratic process,
had elevated us.
The past is the past,
it’s a new year now,
and we are all getting along,
or so they tell me.
I gather we are working together!
The White House and the other House,
hatching little plans together.
– ROBERT: Mother?
– What?
– You’re creating a bottleneck.
– Oh!
MARY: Oh, I’m detaining you.
And more importantly,
the people behind you.
How the people love my husband,
they flock to see him by
their thousands on public days!
They will never love you
the way they love him.
How difficult it must be
for you to know that.
And yet how important to remember it.
Since we have the floor
next in the debate,
I thought I’d suggest you might...
temper your contributions so as not
to frighten our conservative friends?
STEVENS: Ashley insists you’re ensuring
approval by dispensing patronage
to otherwise undeserving Democrats.
LINCOLN: I can’t ensure a single damn
thing if you scare the whole House
with talk of land appropriations,
revolutionary tribunals, punitive...
STEVENS: When the war ends,
I intend to push for
full equality, the Negro vote,
and much more.
Congress shall mandate the seizure
of every foot of rebel land
and every dollar of their property.
We’ll use their confiscated
wealth to establish
hundreds of thousands
of free Negro farmers,
and at their side soldiers armed to occupy
and transform the heritage of traitors.
We’ll build up a land down there
of free men and free women
and free children and freedom.
The nation needs to know
that we have such plans.
That’s the untempered
version of reconstruction.
LINCOLN: It’s not... It’s not
quite exactly what I intend,
but we shall oppose one
another in the course of time.
Now we’re working together,
and I’m asking you...
For patience, I expect.
LINCOLN: When the people disagree,
bringing them together requires
going slow till they’re ready to make up.
Ah, shit on the people,
and what they want,
and what they’re ready for,
I don’t give a goddamn about
the people and what they want!
This is the face of someone
who has fought long and hard
for the good of the people
without caring much for any of ‘em.
And I look a lot worse without my wig.
The people elected me! To represent them!
To lead them! And I lead!
You ought to try it!
I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens,
and I have tried to profit
from the example of it.
If I’d listened to you,
I’d’ve declared every slave free
the minute the first shell
struck Fort Sumter.
Then the border states would’ve
gone over to the confederacy,
the war would’ve been lost
and the Union along with it,
and instead of abolishing slavery,
as we hope to do in two weeks,
we’d be watching helpless
as infants as it spread
from the American South
into South America.
STEVENS: Oh God, how you
have longed to say that to me.
You claim you trust them.
But you know what the people are.
You know that the inner compass
that should direct the soul toward justice
has ossified in white men
and women, north and south,
unto utter uselessness
through tolerating the evil of slavery.
White people cannot bear
the thought of sharing
this country’s infinite
abundance with Negroes.
A compass, I learnt when
I was surveying, it’ll...
it’ll point you True North
from where you’re standing,
but it’s got no advice about the swamps
and deserts and chasms that
you’ll encounter along the way.
If in pursuit of your destination,
you plunge ahead, heedless of obstacles,
and achieve nothing more
than to sink in a swamp...
What’s the use of knowing True North?
LINCOLN: Robert’s gonna
plead with us to let him enlist.
Make time to talk to Robbie.
You only have time for Tad.
– But Tad’s young.
MARY: So is Robert.
Too young for the army.
Plenty of boys younger
than Robert signing up...
Don’t take Robbie.
Don’t let me lose my son.
Go away! We’re occupied!
NICOLAY: Secretary Stanton has sent over
to tell you that as of half an hour ago,
the shelling of Wilmington
harbor has commenced.
STANTON: They cannot possibly
maintain under this kind of an assault.
Terry’s got ten thousand men
surrounding the Goddamned fort,
why doesn’t he answer my cables?
– WELLES: Fort Fisher
is a mountain of a building, Edwin.
MAJOR ECKERT: It’s the
largest fort they have, sir.
WELLES: Twenty-two big
seacoast guns on each rampart.
MAJOR ECKERT: They’ve been
reinforcing it for the last two years
STANTON: They’ve taken 17,000
shells since yesterday!
I want to hear that Fort Fisher is ours
and Wilmington has fallen!
Send another damn cable!
The problem’s their
commander. Whiting!
He engineered the fortress himself.
The damned thing’s his child.
He’ll defend it till his every last man
is gone. He is not thinking...
LINCOLN :
“Come on out, you old rat!”
LINCOLN: That’s what...
That' what Ethan Allen called to the
commander of Fort Ticonderogain in 1776.
“Come on out, you old rat!”
Aah, ‘course there were only forty
odd redcoats at Ticonderoga.
But there is one
Ethan Allen story that I’m...
– STANTON: No!
– .. very partial to...
No, you’re... you’re
going to tell a story!
I don’t believe... that I can bear...
to listen to another one
of your stories right now!
STANTON: I need the B&O sideyard
schedules for Alexandria!
I asked for them this morning!
It was right after the Revolution,
right after peace had been concluded,
and, hum...
Ethan Allen went to London to help our
new country conduct
its business with the king.
The English sneered at how rough we are,
and rude and simple-minded
and on like that,
everywhere he went, till one day
he was invited to the townhouse
of a great English lord.
Dinner was served, beverages imbibed,
time passed, as happens, and
Mr. Allen found he needed the privy.
He was grateful to be directed thence.
Relieved, you might say.
Now, Mr. Allen discovered
on entering the water closet that
the only decoration therein was a...
a portrait of George Washington.
Ethan Allen done what he came to do,
and returned to the drawing room.
His host and the others were disappointed
when he didn’t mention
Washington’s portrait.
And finally His Lordship couldn’t resist,
and asked Mr. Allen had he noticed it,
the picture of Washington. He had.
What did he think of its placement, did it
seem appropriately located to Mr. Allen?
Mr. Allen said it did.
His host was astounded!
Appropriate?
George Washington’s likeness
in a water closet?
Yes, said Mr. Allen, where
it’ll do good service.
The whole world knows
nothing’ll make an Englishman shit
quicker than the sight
of George Washington.
I love that story.
CHARLES BENJAMIN: Fort Fisher
is ours. We’ve taken the port.
WELLES: And Wilmington?
ECKERT: We’ve taken the fort, but the
city of Wilmington has not surrendered.
STANTON: How many casualties?
– FERNANDO WOOD: Heavy losses.
– GEORGE PENDLETON: And more to come.
WOOD: Sours the national mood.
That might suffice to discourage him...
– PENDLETON: To bring this down?
Not in a fight like this.
This is to the death.
WOOD: It’s gruesome!
PENDLETON: Are you despairing,
or merely lazy?
This fight is for The United States
of America. Nothing “suffices”!
A rumor? Nothing!
They’re not lazy.
They’re busily buying votes!
While we hope to be saved
by “the national mood?!”
Before this blood is dry,
when Stevens next takes the floor,
taunt him. You excel at that.
Get him to proclaim what we all know
he believes in his coal-colored heart:
that this vote is meant to set the
black race on high, to niggerate America.
WOOD: George, please. Stay on course.
PENDLETON: Bring Stevens to full froth.
I can ensure that every newspaperman
from Louisville to San Francisco
will be here to witness it and print it.
SCHUYLER COLFAX: The floor
belongs to the mellifluent gentleman
from Kentucky,
Mr. George Yeaman.
YEAMAN: I thank you, Speaker Colfax.
Although... I’m disgusted by slavery
I rise on this sad and solemn day.
to announce that I’m
opposed to the amendment.
We must consider what
will become of colored folk
if four million are in
one instant set free.
LITTON: They’ll be free, George.
That’s what’ll become of them!
SCHELL: Think how splendid
if Mr. Yeaman switched.
LATHAM: Too publicly against us.
He can’t change course now.
BILBO: Not for some
miserable little job anyways.
We will be forced to enfranchise
the men of the colored race.
It would be inhuman not to!
Who among us is prepared
to give Negroes the vote?
YEAMAN: And, and!
What shall follow upon that?
Universal enfranchisement?
Votes for women?
WOOD: Bless my eyes, if it isn’t the
Post Master of Millersburg Ohio!
PENDLETON: Mr. LeClerk felt
honor-bound to inform us
of your disgusting betrayal.
Your prostitution.
WOOD: Is that true, Postmaster Hawkins?
Is your maidenly virtue for sale?
HAWKINS: If my neighbors hear
that I voted yes for nigger freedom
and no to peace, they will kill me.
BILBO: A deal is a deal and you men
know better than to piss your pants
just cause there’s talk
about peace talks.
– HAWKINS: Look, I’ll find another job.
– BILBO: My neighbors in Nashville,
they found out I was loyal to the Union,
they came after me with gelding knives!
– HAWKINS: Any other job!
– BILBO: You do right, Clay Hawkins...
– HAWKINS: I want to do right!
– BILBO: and make yourself some money...
BILBO: .. in the bargain!
– HAWKINS: But I got no courage!
BILBO: Wait!! You wanted, what was it,
tax man for the Western Reserve,
hell you can have the whole
state of Ohio if you... Aw, crap.
SEWARD: Eleven votes?!
Two days ago we had twelve!
What happened?
– There are defections in the Richmond...
– It’s the goddamned rumors regarding...
– LATHAM: Yes! The peace offer!
– SEWARD: Groundless.
SEWARD: I told you that.
– LATHAM: And yet the rumors persist.
SCHELL: They are ruining us.
Among the few remaining representatives
who seem remotely plausible
there is a perceptible
increase in resistance.
BILBO: Resistance, hell!
Thingamabob Hollister, Dem from Indiana?
I approached him, the sumbitch
near to murdered me!
– SEWARD: Perhaps you push too hard.
– BILBO: I push nobody.
Perhaps we need reinforcements.
If Jeff Davis wants to cease hostilities,
who do you think’ll give a genuine
solid shit to free slaves?
Get back to it.
SEWARD: And gentlemen, good day.
SCHELL: We are at an impasse.
LATHAM: Tell Lincoln to
deny the rumors. Publicly.
SCHELL: Tell us what you expect of us.
SEWARD: I expect you to do your work.
And to have sufficient sense and taste
not to presume to instruct the President.
Or me.
SCHELL: Is there a
Confederate offer or not?
GRANT: Gentlemen...
I suggest you work some
changes to your proposal
before you give it to the President.
We’re eager to be on
our way to Washington.
ALEXANDER STEPHENS: Did
Mr. Lincoln tell you to tell us this?
GRANT: It says...“securing peace...
for our two countries.”
And it goes on like that.
– I don’t know what you...
– There’s just one country.
And you and I, we’re
citizens of that country.
I’m fighting to protect it
from armed rebels.
From you.
Mr-Mr. Blair, he-he told us, he...
he told President Davis we were...
A private citizen like Preston Blair
can say what he pleases
since he has no authority over anything.
If you want to discuss peace
with President Lincoln,
consider revisions.
If we’re not to discuss a truce
between warring nations,
what in heaven’s name can we discuss?
Terms of surrender.
GRANT: “Office United States Military
Telegraph War Dept. For Abraham Lincoln,
President of the United States,
January 20, 1865.
I will state confidentially
that I am convinced,
upon conversation with
these Commissioners,
that their intentions are good
and their desire sincere
to restore peace and union.
I fear now their going back,
without any expression of interest.”
“...from anyone in authority,
Mr. Lincoln will have a bad influence.”
“I will be sorry should it
prove impossible for you
to have an interview with them.
I am awaiting your instructions.
U.S. Grant, Lieutenant General
Commanding Armies United States”.
After four years of war and...
near 600,000 lives lost,
he believes we can end this war now.
My trust in him is marrow deep.
SEWARD: You could bring
the delegates to Washington.
In exchange for the South’s
immediate surrender,
we could promise them
the amendment’s defeat.
They’d agree, don’t you think?
We’d end the war. This week.
Or if you could manage,
without seeming to do it, to....
The peace delegation might encounter
delays as they travel up the James River.
Particularly with the
fighting around Wilmington.
Within ten days time, we might
pass the Thirteenth Amendment.
LINCOLN: Here’s a sixteen year old boy.
They’re gonna hang him...
He was with the 15th Indiana
Calvary near Beaufort,
seems he lamed his horse to avoid battle.
I don’t think even Stanton
would complain if I pardoned him,
You think Stanton would complain?
JOHN HAY: I don’t know, sir,
I don’t know who you’re, uh...
What time is it?
LINCOLN: It’s three forty in the morning.
NICOLAY: Don’t let him pardon any more deserters...
HAY: Aah, Mr. Stanton
thinks you pardon too many.
He’s generally apoplectic on the subject.
LINCOLN: He oughtn’t to have done that,
crippled his horse, that was cruel,
but you don’t just hang
a sixteen year old boy for that...
HAY: Ask the horse what he thinks.
.. for cruelty. There’d be no
sixteen year old boys left.
Grant wants me to bring
the secesh delegates to Washington.
HAY: So there are secesh delegates?
LINCOLN: He was afraid, that’s all it was.
I don’t care to hang a boy
for being frightened, either.
What good would it do him?
War’s nearly done, ain’t that so?
What use one more corpse?
Any more corpses?
HAY: Do you need company?
LINCOLN: In times like this,
I’m best alone.
LINCOLN: “Lieutenant General
Ulysses S. Grant, City Point.
I have read your words with interest.”
“I ask that, regardless
of any action I take
in the matter of the visit
of the Richmond commissioners,
you maintain among your troops
military preparedness for battle,
as you have done until now.”
“Have Captain Saunders convey the
commissioners to me here in Washington.”
“A. Lincoln” and the date.
– SAMUEL BECKWITH: Yes sir.
Shall I transmit, sir?
LINCOLN: You think we choose to be born?
BECKWITH: I don’t suppose so.
LINCOLN: Are we fitted to
the times we’re born into?
BECKWITH: Well, I don’t know about myself.
You may be...
sir. Fitted.
What do you reckon?
HOMER BATES: Well, I’m an engineer.
BATES: I reckon there’s machinery but...
no one’s done the fitting.
LINCOLN: You’re an engineer. You must
know Euclid’s axioms and common notions.
BATES: I must’ve in school, but...
LINCOLN: I never had much
of schooling, but I read Euclid,
in an old book I borrowed.
Little enough ever found
its way in here, but...
once learnt it stayed learnt.
Euclid’s first common notion is this:
“Things which are equal to the
same thing are equal to each other.”
That’s a rule of mathematical reasoning.
It’s true because it works.
Has done and always will do.
In his book, hmm...
Euclid says this is
“self-evident.”
D’you see, there it is, even in that two
thousand year old book of mechanical law:
it is a self evident truth that things
which are equal to the same thing
are equal to each other.
We begin with equality.
That’s the origin, isn’t it?
That balance, that's... that’s fairness.
That’s justice.
Just read me back the last
sentence of that telegram, please.
BECKWITH: “Have Captain Saunders convey
the commissioners to me here in Washington.”
A slight emendation if you would, Sam.
“Have Captain Saunders convey
the gentlemen aboard the River Queen
as far as Hampton Roads, Virginia,
and there wait until...”
“.. further advice from me.”
“Do not proceed to Washington.”
COLFAX: The World, the Herald
and the Times, New York, Chicago,
the Journal of Commerce,
even your hometown paper’s here.
ASHLEY: Say you believe only
in legal equality for all races,
not racial quality. I beg you, sir.
Compromise.
Or you risk it all.
WOOD: I’ve asked you a question,
Mr. Stevens, and you must answer me.
Do you or do you not hold
that the precept that
“all men are created equal”
is meant literally?
WOOD : Is that not the
true purpose of the amendment?
To promote your ultimate and
ardent dream to elevate...
STEVENS: The true purpose
of the amendment, Mr. Wood,
you perfectly-named,
brainless, obstructive object?
Now you have always insisted, Mr. Stevens,
that Negroes are the same
as white men are.
The true purpose of the amendment...
I don’t hold with equality in all things,
only with equality before
the law and nothing more.
That’s not so!
You...
You believe that Negroes
are entirely equal to white men.
You’ve said it a thousand times...
– PENDLETON: For shame! For shame!
Stop prevaricating and answer,
Representative Wood!
I don’t hold with equality in all things,
only with equality...
– After the decades
STEVENS: .. and nothing more!
ASHLEY: He's answered your questions!
This amendment has naught
to do with race equality!
– S: I don’t hold with equality in all things...
– P: You have long insisted, have you not...
– S: only with equality before the law...
– P: that the dusk colored race...
– S: and nothing more.
– P: is no different from the white one.
MARY: Who’d ever’ve guessed that old
nightmare capable of such control?
He might make a politician someday...
– MRS. KECKLEY: I need to go.
– MARY: Mrs. Keykley!
PENDLETON: Your frantic attempt to delude
us now is unworthy of a representative.
It is in fact, unworthy of a white man!
How can I hold that all men
are created equal,
when here before me stands, stinking,
the moral carcass of
the gentleman from Ohio,
proof that some men are inferior,
endowed by their Maker with dim wits,
impermeable to reason
with cold pallid slime
in their veins instead
of hot red blood!
You are more reptile than man, George,
so low and flat that the foot of man
is incapable of crushing you!
PENDLETON: How dare you!
Yet even you, Pendleton,
who should have been gibbetted
for treason long before today,
even worthless unworthy you ought
to be treated equally before the law!
And so again, sir, and again
and again and again I say:
I DO NOT HOLD WITH
EQUALITY IN ALL THINGS.
ONLY WITH EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW.
PENDLETON: Mr. Speaker,
will you permit this vile boorish man
to slander ant to threaten me and...
LITTON: You asked... if ever I was surprised.
Today... Mr. Stevens,
I was surprised.
You’ve led the battle for
race equality for thirty years!
The basis of... of every hope
for this country’s future life,
you denied Negro equality!
I’m nauseated.
You refused to say that all
humans are, well... human!
Have you lost your very soul, Mr. Stevens
Is there nothing you won’t say?
I’m sorry you’re nauseous, Asa,
that must be unpleasant.
I want the amendment to pass.
So that the Constitution’s first
and only mention of slavery
is its absolute prohibition.
For this amendment, for which
I have worked all of my life
and for which countless colored men
and women have fought and died
and now hundreds of
thousands of soldiers.
No, sir, no.
It seems there is very
nearly nothing I won’t say.
RERT: I’m not going in.
LINCOLN: You said you wanted to help me.
This is... This is just a clumsy
attempt at discouragement.
I’ve been to army hospitals,
I’ve seen surgeries,
I went and visited the
malaria barges with mama.
LINCOLN: She told me
she didn’t take you inside.
I snuck in afterwards. I’ve seen
what it’s like, this changes nothing.
At all rates, I’m happy
to have your company.
LINCOLN: Morning, Jim.
ARMY SURGEON: Hello, Mr. President.
LINCOLN: Good to see you again.
Well boys, first question:
You getting enough to eat?
FIRST PATIENT: Hello, sir.
– What’s your name, soldier?
– Robert.
Robert. Good to meet you, Robert.
KEVIN: Nice to meet you.
– What’s your name?
– Kevin.
Tell me your names as I go past.
I like to know who I’m talkin’ to. Kevin.
– Mr. President, John.
– John.
I’ve seen you before.
– Mr. President...
LINCOLN: Make sure you get
some steak, I wouldn’t mind...
LINCOLN: What’s the matter, Bob?
I have to do this!
And I will do it and I don’t
need your permission to enlist.
That same speech has been
made by how many sons,
to how many fathers since the war began?
“I don’t need your damn permission,
you miserable old goat,
I'm gonna enlist anyhow!”
And what wouldn’t those
numberless fathers have given
to be able to say to their sons as...
I now say to mine,
”I’m commander-in-chief,
so in point of fact,
without my permission,
you ain’t enlisting in nothing,
nowhere, young man.”
It’s mama you’re scared of,
not me getting killed.
I have to do this! And I will!
Or I will feel ashamed of myself
for the rest of my life.
Whether or not you fought
is what’s gonna matter.
And not just to other people,
but to myself.
I won’t be you, pa. I can’t do that.
But I don’t want to be nothing.
LINCOLN: He’ll be fine, Molly.
City Point’s away back from
the front lines, from the fighting,
he’ll be an adjutant running
messages for General Grant.
The war will take our son!
A sniper, or a shrapnel
shell, or typhus!
Same as took Willie,
it takes hundreds of boys a day!
He’ll die uselessly, and how
will I ever forgive you?
Most men, their firstborn
is their favorite, but you,
you’ve always blamed Robert
for being born,
for trapping you in a marriage
that’s only ever given you grief
and caused you regret.
– LINCOLN: That’s simply not true.
And if the slaughter of Cold Harbor is on
your hands same as Grant, God help us!
We’ll pay for the oceans of
spilled blood you’ve sanctioned,
the uncountable corpses we’ll be
made to pay with our son’s dear blood.
Just, just this once, Mrs. Lincoln,
I demand of you to try and take the
liberal and not the selfish point of view.
Robert will never forgive himself.
You imagine he''ll forgive us
if we continue to stifle his
very natural ambition?!
And if I refuse to take the highroad,
if I won’t take up the rough old cross,
will you threaten me again
with the madhouse,
as you did when I couldn’t
stop crying over Willie,
when I showed you what heartbreak,
real heartbreak looked like,
and you hadn’t the courage
to countenance it, to help me...
LINCOLN: That’s right. When you
refused so much as to comfort Tad...
– M: I was in the room with Willie,
– L: the child who was not only sick,
– M: I was holding him...
– L: but beside himself with grief?
– M: in my arms as he died!
– L: Oh but your grief, your grief, your...
L: inexhaustible grief!
– M: How dare you throw that at me?!
– L: And his mother won’t let him near her,
– M: I couldn’t let Tad in!
– L: ‘cos she’s screaming from morning to night,
– M: I couldn’t risk him
M: seeing how angry I was!
– L: pacing the corridors,
howling at shadows
and furniture and ghosts!
I ought to have done it, I ought
have done for Tad’s sake,
for everybody’s goddamned sake,
I should have clapped you in the madhouse!
Then do it!!
Do it! Don’t you threaten me,
you do it this time, lock me away!
You’ll have to, I swear!
If Robert is killed...
I couldn’t tolerate you
grieving so for Willie
because I couldn’t permit it in myself,
though I wanted to, Mary.
I wanted to crawl under the earth,
into the vault with his coffin.
And I still do. Everyday I do.
Don’t speak to me about grief.
I must make my decisions,
Bob must make his, you yours.
And... bear what we must,
hold and carry what we must.
What I carry within me,
you must allow me to do it,
alone as I must.
And you alone, Mary,
you alone...
may lighten this burden,
or render it intolerable.
As you choose.
MARY: You think I’m ignorant
of what you’re up to
because you haven’t discussed this scheme
with me as you ought to have done.
When have I ever been
so easily bamboozled?
I believe you when you insist
that amending the constitution
and abolishing slavery will end this war.
And since you are sending
my son into the war,
woe unto you if you fail
to pass the amendment.
Seward doesn’t want me leaving
big muddy footprints all over town.
No one has ever lived who
knows better than you
the proper placement of
footfalls on treacherous paths.
Seward can’t do it.
You must.
Because if you fail to acquire
the necessary votes,
woe unto you, sir, you will answer to me.
MRS. KECKLEY: I know the
vote is only four days away.
I know you’re concerned.
Thank you for your concern over this,
and I want you to know,
they’ll approve it.
God will see to it.
LINCOLN: I don’t envy him His task.
He may wish He’d chosen an
instrument for His purpose
more wieldy than the
House of Representatives.
MRS. KECKLEY: Then you’ll see to it.
Are you afraid of what lies
ahead for your people?
If we succeed?
White people don’t want us here.
– LINCOLN: Many don’t.
– What about you?
I don’t know you, Mrs. Keckley.
Any of you.
You’re familiar to me, as all people are.
Unaccommodated, poor, bare,
forked creatures such as we all are.
You have a right to expect what I expect,
and likely our expectations are
not incomprehensible to each other.
I assume I’ll get used to you.
But what you are to the nation,
what’ll become of you once slavery’s
day is done, I don’t know.
What my people are to be, I can’t say.
I never heard any ask what
freedom will bring. Freedom’s a first.
As for me...
My son died, fighting for the Union...
wearing the Union blue.
For freedom he died.
I’m his mother.
That’s what I am
to the nation, Mr. Lincoln.
What else must I be?
BILBO: My whole hand’s gonna
be proud in about five seconds.
– LATHAM: Oh, it is? What you got goin’?
– BILBO: Let’s see how proud you gonna be.
– BILBO: Yeah?
– LATHAM: Go away!
– LATHAM: That watch fob, is that gold?
– BILBO: You keep your eyes off my fob!
– SEWARD: Gentlemen...
– LATHAM: Nines paired!
– SEWARD: .. you have a visitor.
– BILBO: Oh my God damn!
Well, I’ll be fucked.
I wouldn’t bet against it, Mr...?
– W.N. Bilbo.
– Yeah, Mr. Bilbo.
Gentlemen.
– Sir...
BILBO: Why are you here?
No offense, but Mr. Seward’s
banished the very mention of your name,
he won’t even let us use fifty-cent pieces
‘cause they got your face on ‘em.
LINCOLN: The Secretary of
State here tells me that, uh,
you got eleven Democrats
in the bag, that’s encouraging.
LATHAM: Oh, you've got no
cause to be encouraged,
Sir. Uh...
SCHELL: Are we being... fired?
LINCOLN: “We have heard the
chimes of midnight, Master Shallow.”
I’m here to alert you boys that the
great day of reckoning is nigh upon us.
SCHELL: The Democrats
we’ve yet to bag, sir.
The patronage jobs simply won’t bag ‘em.
They require more... convincing,
Mr. President.
LINCOLN: Mm-hmm.
Do me a favor, will ya?
BILBO: Sure.
LINCOLN: I snagged my eye
in the paper this morning,
and Governor Curtin is set
to declare a winner in the
disputed Congressional election for the...
BILBO: Pennsylvania 16th District.
.. District. What a joy
to be comprehended.
Hop on a train to Philadell,
call on the Governor...
SEWARD: Send Latham. Or Schell.
LINCOLN: No, he’ll do fine, just...
polish yourself up first.
LATHAM: The incumbent
is claiming he won it.
LATHAM: Name of, uh...
– BILBO: Coffroth.
– LINCOLN: That’s him.
– SCHELL: Coffroth.
SCHELL: He is a Democrat.
– LINCOLN: I understand that.
– BILBO: Silly name.
– LINCOLN: A little bit silly.
LINCOLN: Huh, Tell Governor
Curtin it’d be much appreciated
if he’d invite the House of
Representatives to decide who won.
He’s entitled to do that.
He’ll agree to it.
Then advise Coffroth, if
he hopes to retain his seat,
that he’d better pay a visit
to Thaddeus Stevens.
SEWARD: Oh, pity poor Coffroth!
STEVENS: It opens!
STEVENS: You are Canfrey?
Coffroth, Mr. Stevens,
Alexander Coffroth, I’m...
STEVENS: Are we representatives
of the same state?
Y-yes sir, We sit only three desks apart.
STEVENS: I haven’t noticed you. I’m...
a Republican, and you,
Coughdrop, are a Democrat?
Well...
Um, that is to say, I...
STEVENS: The modern travesty of
Thomas Jefferson’s political organization
to which you have attached
yourself like a barnacle
has the effrontery to call
itself The Democratic Party.
You are a Dem-O-crat.
What’s the matter with you?
Are you wicked?
Well, I felt, um, formerly, I...
Never mind, Coffsnot, you were
ignominiously trounced at the hustings
in November’s election by your
worthy challenger, a Republican.
No, sir, I was not, um, trounced!
Uh, he wants to steal my seat!
I didn’t lose the election...
What difference does
it make if you lost or not,
the governor of our state, is...
A Democrat?
No, he’s a...
A, um, a Ruh...
Re.
Re.
– Pub.
– Pub.
– Li.
– Li.
– Can.
– Can. Republican.
I know what he is.
This is a rhetorical exercise.
And Congress is controlled
by what party? Yours?
Your party was beaten,
your challenger’s party
now controls the House,
and hence the House
Committee on Elections,
so you have been beaten.
You shall shortly be sent
home in disgrace. Unless...
I know what I must do, sir,
I will immediately become
a Republican and vote yes for...
NO!
Coffroth... will vote yes,
but Coffroth will remain a
Democrat until after he does so.
Why wait to switch?
I’m happy to switch...
We want to show the amendment
has bipartisan support, you idiot.
Early in the next Congress, when I tell
you to do so, you will switch parties.
Now congratulations on your
victory, and get out.
Now... give me the names of
whoever else you been hunting.
– LATHAM: George Yeaman.
– SCHELL: Yes. Yeaman.
BILBO: Among others.
But Yeaman, that’d count.
– LATHAM: Y-E-A-M-A-N.
– LINCOLN: I got it.
LATHAM: Kentucky.
YEAMAN: I can’t vote for
the amendment, Mr. Lincoln.
I saw a barge once, Mr. Yeaman,
filled with colored men in chains,
heading down the Mississippi
to the New Orleans slave markets.
It sickened me.
And more than that,
it brought a shadow down,
a pall around my eyes.
Slavery troubled me
as long as I can remember
in a way it never troubled my father,
though he hated it, in his own fashion.
He knew no small holding dirt farmer
could compete with slave plantations.
He took us out from Kentucky...
to get away from ‘em.
He wanted Indiana kept free.
He wasn’t a kind man,
but there was a rough moral urge
for fairness, for freedom in him.
I learnt that from him, I suppose,
if little else from him.
We didn’t care for one
another, Mr. Yeaman.
– Well, I’m sorry to hear that.
– Loving kindness,
that most ordinary... thing
came to me
from other sources..
I’m grateful for that.
YEAMAN: I... I hate it, too, sir...
slavery, but...
but we’re entirely unready
for emancipation.
There’s too many questions...
– We’re unready for peace too, ain’t we?
Yeah, when it comes, it’ll present
us with conundrums and
dangers greater than any we’ve faced
during the war, bloody as it’s been.
We’ll have to extemporize
and experiment with
what it is, when it is.
I read your speech, George.
Negroes and the vote, that's a puzzle.
No, no, but-but-but
but Negroes can't...
um... vote, Mr. Lincoln.
You're not suggesting we
enfranchise colored people.
I'm asking only that you disenthrall
yourself from the slave powers.
I'll let you know when there's
an offer on my desk for surrender.
There's none before us now.
What's before us now, that's the vote
on the Thirteenth Amendment.
It's going to be so very close.
You see what you can do.
WILLIAM HUTTON: I can’t make
sense of it, what he died for.
Mr. Lincoln, I hate them all,
I do, all black people.
I am a prejudiced man.
I’d change that in you if I could,
but that’s not why I come.
I might be wrong, Mr. Hutton, but I expect
colored people will most likely be free.
And when that’s so, it’s simple
truth that your brother’s
bravery, and his death, helped make it so.
Only you can decide whether
that’s sense enough for you, or not.
My deepest sympathies to your family.
PRESTON BLAIR: We’ve managed
our members to a fare thee-well.
You’ve had no defections from
the Republican right to trouble you.
Whereas as to what you promised...
where the hell are the commissioners?!
JAMES ASHLEY: Oh my God... It’s true!
You... you lied to me, Mr. Lincoln!
You evaded my requests for a denial that-
that there is a Confederate peace offer
because... because there is one!
We are absolutely guaranteed
to lose the whole thing!
MONTGOMERY BLAIR: We don’t need
a goddamned abolition amendment.
M.B.: Leave the Constitution alone!
– ASHLEY: What if... what if...
.. these peace commissioners
appear today, or...
ASHLEY: .. or worse, on the morning...
– M.B.: State by state you can extirpate...
I can’t listen to this anymore.
I can’t accomplish a goddamned
thing of any human meaning
or worth until we cure ourselves of
slavery, and end this pestilential war,
and whether any of you or
anyone else knows it, I know I need this!
This amendment is that cure!
We’re stepped out upon
the world’s stage now, NOW!
With the fate of human
dignity in our hands!
Blood’s been spilt to afford us
this moment! Now now now!
But you grousle and heckle and dodge about
like pettifogging Tammany Hall hucksters!
See what is before you!
See the here and now!
That’s the hardest thing,
the only thing that accounts!
Abolishing slavery by
constitutional provision
settles the fate, for all coming time,
not only of the millions now in bondage
but of unborn millions to come.
Two votes stand in its way,
and these votes must be procured!
We need two yeses,
three abstentions, or
four yeses and one more abstention
and the amendment will pass.
You got a night and a day and a night
and several perfectly good hours,
now get the hell out of here and get ‘em!
ASHLEY: Yes. But how?
Buzzards’ guts, man.
I am the President of the
United States of America,
clothed in immense power!
You will procure me these votes.
LITTON: We welcome you,
ladies and gentlemen,
first in the history of this
people’s chamber, to your House!
COLFAX: Mr. Ashley, the floor is yours.
ASHLEY: On the matter of
the joint resolution before us,
presenting a Thirteenth Amendment
to our national Constitution,
which was passed last year by the Senate,
and which has been debated now by this
estimable body for the past several weeks,
today we will vote...
By mutual agreement, we shall
hear  final statements,
beginning with the honorable
George Pendleton of Ohio.
PENDLETON: I’ve just received
confirmation
of what previously has
been merely rumored!
Affidavits!
From loyal citizens recently
returned from Richmond.
They testify that
Commissioners have indeed
come north and ought to have
arrived by now in Washington City,
bearing an offer of immediate
cessation of our civil war!
WOOD: Is it true, sir?
WOOD: Are there Confederate
commissioners in the Capitol?
ASHLEY: I don’t... I have no idea
where they are or if they’ve arrived.
WOOD: If they’ve arrived?!
PENDLETON: I appeal to
my fellow Democrats,
to all Republican representatives
who give a fig for peace!
Postpone this vote until we have
answers from the President himself!
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!
Postpone the vote!
Postpone the vote!
Postpone the vote!
Postpone the vote!
AARON HADDAM: Gentlemen!
WOOD: I have made a motion!
Does anyone here care to second my motion?
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!
HADDAM: Gentlemen.
The conservative faction of
border and western Republicans
cannot approve this amendment,
about which we harbor grave doubts...
if a peace offer is being
held hostage to its success.
Joining together with our Democratic
colleagues, I second the motion to postpone.
LATHAM: Quick, man! Quick!
LINCOLN: This is precisely what
Mr. Wood wishes me to respond to?
Word for word, this is precisely the
assurance that he demands of me?
BILBO: Yes sir.
Give this to Mr. Ashley.
JOHN HAY: I feel, um, I have
to say, Mr. Lincoln, that this...
Could you please just step outside?!
You gonna have a chat now,
with the whole of the House of
Representatives waiting on that?
Making false representation
to Congress is...
It’s, it’s...
– It's Impeachable.
I’ve made no false representation.
But there are!
There is a delegation from Richmond.
LINCOLN: Give me the note, Johnnie.
Please deliver that to Mr. Ashley.
ASHLEY: From the President:
“So far as I know, there are no
peace commissioners in the city
nor are there likely to be”.
PENDLETON: “So far as I know”?!
That means nothing!
Are there commissioners from
the South or aren’t there?!
ASHLEY: The President
has answered you, sir.
Your peace offer is a fiction!
PENDLETON: That is not a denial,
it is a lawyer’s dodge!
ASHLEY: Mr. Haddam,
is your faction satisfied?
The conservative Republican
faction’s satisfied,
and we thank Mr. Lincoln.
I move to table Mr. Wood’s motion.
COLFAX: Tabled!
ASHLEY: Speaker Colfax,
I order the main question.
A motion has been made to bring the bill
for the Thirteenth Amendment to a vote.
Do I hear a second?
–  LITTON: I second the motion.
COLFAX: So moved, so ordered.

COLFAX: The clerk will now

COLFAX: Mr. Clerk...
Please call my name.
I want to cast a vote.
PENDLETON: I object!
The Speaker doesn’t vote!
COLFAX: The Speaker
may vote if he so chooses.
It is highly unusual, sir.
This isn’t usual, Mr. Pendleton.
This is history.
CLERK: How does Mr. Schuyler Colfax vote?
Aye, of course.
The final vote.
eight absent or not voting,
fifty six votes against,
one hundred nineteen votes for,
with a margin of two votes...
Ashley, this time we've made it!
CLERk: Congratulations, Mr. Chairman.
With the bill, Mr. McPherson, may I...?
CLERK: That's... that’s the official bill.
I’ll return it in the morning.
Creased...
but unharmed.
STEVENS: A gift for you.
STEVENS: The greatest measure
of the Nineteenth Century,
passed by corruption, aided and
abetted by the purest man in America.
Aah, I wish you’d been present.
– LYDIA SMITH: I wish I’d been.
– It was a spectacle.
LYDIA: You can’t bring
your housekeeper to the House.
I won’t give them gossip.
This is enough.
This is...
It’s more than enough for now.
STEVENS: Read it to me again, my love.
LYDIA: “Proposed”...
– And adopted.
– Adopted.
“An Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States.
Section One: Neither slavery nor
involuntary servitude,
except as a punishment for crime
whereof the party shall
have been duly convicted,
shall exist within the United States,
or any place subject
to their jurisdiction.”
– Section Two.
– “Congress shall have power
to enforce this amendment
by appropriate legislation.”
ALEXANDER STEPHENS:
Let me be blunt.
Will the southern states resume
their former position in the Union
speedily enough to enable us to block
ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment?
LINCOLN: I’d like peace immediately.
STEPHENS: Yes, and...?
LINCOLN: I’d like your states restored
to their practical relations
to the Union immediately.
If this could be given me in writing,
as Vice President of the Confederacy,
I’d bring that document
with celerity to Jefferson Davis.
SEWARD: Surrender, and
we can discuss reconstruction.
Surrender won’t be thought of
unless you’ve assured us, in writing,
that we’ll be readmitted in
time to block this amendment.
HUNTER: This is the arrogant
demand of a conqueror.
SEWARD: You’ll not be a conquered
people, Mr. Hunter, you will be citizens.
Returned to the laws and the
guarantees of rights of the Constitution.
Which now extinguishes slavery.
And with it our economy.
All our laws will be determined by
a Congress of vengeful Yankees,
all our rights’ll be subject
to a Supreme Court
benched by Black Republican radicals.
All our traditions will be obliterated.
We won’t know ourselves anymore.
We ain’t here to discuss reconstruction,
we have no legal basis
for that discussion.
But I don’t want to deal falsely.
The Northern states’ll ratify,
most of ‘em.
As I figure, it remains for two of
the Southern states to do the same,
even after all are readmitted.
And I been working on that.
Tennessee and Louisiana.
Arkansas too, most likely.
It’ll be ratified.
Slavery, sir... it’s done.
If we submit ourselves to law, Alex,
even submit to losing freedoms...
the freedom to oppress, for instance...
we may discover other freedoms
previously unknown to us.
Had you kept faith with
democratic process,
as frustrating as that can be...
– CAMPBELL: Come sir,
spare us at least these pieties.
Did you defeat us with ballots?
STEPHENS: How’ve you held your Union together?
Through democracy?
How many hundreds of thousands
have died during your administration?
Your Union, sir, is bonded
in cannon fire and death.
LINCOLN: It may be you’re right.
But say all we done is show
the world that democracy isn’t chaos,
that there is a great invisible
strength in a people’s union?
Say we’ve shown that a people can
endure awful sacrifice and yet cohere?
Mightn’t that save at least the
idea of democracy to aspire to?
Eventually, to become worthy of?
At all rates, whatever may be
proven by blood and sacrifice
must’ve been proved by now.
Shall we stop this bleeding?
LINCOLN: Once he surrenders, send
his boys back to their homes,
their farms, their shops.
GRANT: Yes sir... as we discussed.
LINCOLN: Liberality all around.
No punishment. I don’t want that.
And the leaders -Jeff
and the rest of ‘em...
if they escape, leave the
country while my back’s turned,
that wouldn’t upset me none.
When peace comes
it mustn’t just be hangings.
By outward appearance,
you’re ten years older
than you were a year ago.
Some weariness has bit at my bones.
I never seen the like of it before.
What I seen today.
Never seen the like of it before.
GRANT: You always knew that...
what this was going to be.
Intimate, and ugly.
You must’ve needed to see it close
when you decided to come down here.
LINCOLN: We’ve made it possible
for one another to do terrible things.
GRANT: And we’ve won the war.
Now you have to lead us out of it.
You’ve an itch to travel?
I’d like that.
To the West by rail.
Overseas.
The Holy Land.
Awfully pious for a man who takes
his wife out buggy-riding on Good Friday.
Jerusalem.
Where David and Solomon walked.
I dream of... walking
in that ancient city.
All anyone will remember of me is
I was crazy and I ruined your happiness.
Anyone thinks that
doesn’t understand, Molly.
When they look at you,
at what it cost to live
at the heart of this,
they’ll wonder at it. They’ll
wonder at you, they should.
But they should also look
at the wretched woman by your side,
if they want to understand
what this was truly like.
For the ordinary person.
For anyone other than you.
We must try to be happier.
We must. Both of us.
We’ve been so miserable for so long.
LINCOLN: I did say some colored men,
the intelligent, the educated,
and veterans, I qualified it.
ASHLEY: Mr. Stevens is furious,
he wants to know why you qualified it.
COLFAX: No one's heard the
intelligent or the educated part.
All they heard was the first time
any president has ever made mention
of Negro voting.
LINCOLN: Still, I wish I had
mentioned it in a better speech.
ASHLEY: Mr. Stevens also wants to know
why you didn’t make a better speech.
NICOLAY: Mrs. Lincoln’s
waiting in the carriage.
She wants me to remind you of the hour,
and that you’ll have to pick up
Miss Harris and Major Rathbone.
– LINCOLN: Am I in trouble?
– SLADE: No, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Slade.
LINCOLN: I suppose it’s time to go,
though I would rather stay.
OWNER OF THE THEATER:
The President has been shot!
The President has been
shot at Ford’s Theater!
DR. BARNES: It’s... 7:22 in the morning,
Saturday the 15th of April.
It’s all over.
The President is no more.
STANTON: Now he belongs to the ages.
LINCOLN: Fondly do we hope,
fervently do we pray,
that this mighty scourge of war
may speedily pass away.
Yet, if God wills that it continue
until all the wealth piled by
the bondman's
two hundred and fifty years
of unrequited toil shall be sunk,
and until every drop of
blood drawn with the lash
shall be paid by another
drawn with the sword,
as was said three thousand years ago,
so still it must be said
"the judgments of the Lord are
true and righteous altogether.”
With malice toward none,
with charity for all,
with firmness in the right as
God gives us to see the right,
let us strive on to finish
the work we are in,
to bind up the nation's wounds,
to care for him who shall
have borne the battle,
and for his widow and his orphan,
to do all which may achieve and cherish
a just and a lasting peace among ourselves
and with all nations.
