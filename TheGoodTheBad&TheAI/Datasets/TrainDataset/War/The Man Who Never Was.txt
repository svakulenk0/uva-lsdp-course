—
Too obvious.
Here we are, all along the North African coast,
except for Tunisia...
and here's Jerry opposite
from the Pyrenees to Greece.
He knows we're coming, and he knows
we're almost certain to come through here.
All he's got to do
is to sit and wait for us.
As a king's counsel, Montagu,
and a leading member of the bar...
you've sometimes defended a man
in peril of his life.
Yes, sir.
Well, here's your chance
to defend thousands of men.
If we land in Sicily now,
we shall have 30% casualties getting ashore.
We sit in offices
and talk about casualties...
as though they were just figures
on a bit of paper.
I take it the chiefs of staff
want us to think up a cover plan.
One that'll makeJerry think
we're going somewhere else.
Greece, Sardinia...
the south of France.
I'm told Corsica is very pleasant.
But with respect, sir...
the Germans know we need Sicily.
They must go on defending it.
But we may make them
thin their defenses a bit...
if they think the main attack
is coming somewhere else.
You and your outfit
must drop everything for it.
If we can getJerry...
to move one single battalion...
a battery, or even a gun...
it's going to save a lot of lives.
Now, to your left
you will see a further wave of aircraft.
Just for a moment
I thought someone had had it.
Me too. Those things aren't nearly as safe
as they're made out to be.
I don't think there's
anything for us here, George.
Any scheme that means using troops
would take far too long to set up.
Next phase:
"Use of natural cover."
Let's slide out.
Monty, that parachute
that didn't open—
Suppose we were to drop a fellow
out of a plane over enemy territory...
with papers on him saying
we were going to invade Greece...
and  parachute didn't open up.
The Germans would find him dead...
and the papers...
and "A-ha," they'd say, "look at this.
"Officer with secret papers,
parachute didn't open—
they're going to invade Greece."
Do we tell the man who jumps
that the parachute doesn't work...
or is it a sort of practical joke
that he finds out on the way down?
Well, of course it'd have to be somebody
we didn't mind much about.
Are you volunteering?
No, George, it wouldn't work.
What about using a man already dead?
The autopsy would show he'd been dead
before he hit the ground.
Let's get back to the office
and think again.
If those boys of yours drink any more coffee,
they won't be able to sleep.
That won't worry them.
They gave up sleeping two days ago.
Will you come and get it
while it's hot, sir?
Monty, what we really want...
is something absolutely simple.
- The simpler the better.
- Good boy, George. You're absolutely right.
How about this? Supposing we issue
Greek dictionaries to all the troops.
Why should we do that unless we intend
to invade Greece? That'd fool 'em.
I'd make it Eskimo dictionaries.
That would  fool them.
Pam, first thing in the morning...
I want you to get me
the fullest possible details...
of the tides and currents between...
Gibraltar
and the Portuguese border.
- Between where, sir?
- Gibraltar and the Portuguese border.
- Yes, sir.
- Going for a swim?
No.
Sardine fishing.
Now, Pam, it's getting late.
You'd better get off home.
Are you sure you don't want
some sandwiches before I go?
My dear child,
you must try not to be so greedy.
You think of nothing but my stomach.
Go on, hop it.
Leave the coffee.
Poor Pam.
How she does fuss over you.
Close the door, George.
Come here.
That idea of yours yesterday about a dead body
and a parachute that doesn't open—
Yes?
It won't work the way you had it, but...
I have an idea about something
that just might work.
- Good night, miss.
- Good night.
Come on in, Pam.
Joe, this is Pam...
who runs this war
pretty well single-handedly...
from crack of dawn till midnight.
Pam, this is Joe.
- Hello.
- Hello, Pam.
- Don't mind me. I'm just passing through.
- Good-bye, little train.
Later.
So, that's Pam.
She looks all right.
But, Lu...
why don't you have
a place on your own?
This apartment belongs to her parents.
We get it rent-free.
Besides, I need a nice, steady,
sensible girl around, and that's what Pam is.
- I've gotta have somebody to protect me.
- From me?
I hope so.
- Come on. You've got to go.
- I know.
- You flying tomorrow?
- Maybe.
I've never asked you this, Joe—
- Does it scare you?
- I get used to it.
- You'll ring me when you get back.
- As soon as I can.
You won't ever forget to ring,
every evening.
- Because if I didn't hear, I think I'd go mad.
- I'll ring, Lu.
Or if anything stops me, Larry'll ring.
- What do you mean, if anything stops you?
- Oh, just anything.
- Home long?
- About 7:00.
You were late. They certainly get their
money's worth out of you in that joint.
So that's Joe.
I always thought he was an American.
Maybe the one you're thinking of was.
I don't know how you
keep away from these boys, Pam.
I know me.
If I started anything like that,
I'd probably fall in love.
I'd only want one.
And then where would we be?
Let's get the war over first...
and then I'll think about it.
That's what I'm afraid you'll do—
fall in love with someone you can't have.
- Don't do it, Lucy. You'll only get hurt.
- Who, me?
Lucy, the languishing librarian?
Not a chance.
If ever I fall in love, it'll be with a guy
who goes out at 9:00 to a nice, safe office...
and comes back at 6:00.
Not one of these flyers—
here today and gone tomorrow.
- Come in.
Commander Montagu
and Lieutenant Acres, sir.
- Sir Bernard.
- Nice to see you.
- How are you?
- Well, thank you.
My chief assistant, George Acres,
Sir Bernard Spilsbury.
- How do you do?
- I'm honored to meet you, sir.
I've always wanted to ever since I heard you
give evidence in the Shotgun Murders.
- You were absolutely masterly.
- Thank you.
Though, mind you,
for sheer brilliance—
No doubt if you continue to charm Sir Bernard,
he'll give you his autograph later.
- Meantime, may we get on?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
- Sit down.
Thank you.
Sir Bernard...
may I ask you some rather odd questions
without explaining why I'm asking them?
You may.
Suppose I wanted
to put a dead body in the sea...
let it float ashore and have it accepted
by the people who find it...
as the victim of an air crash at sea.
What sort of body would I need?
Do you want the body
to show any physical damage?
No.
- But to look as though he'd died by drowning.
- Yes.
- Could he be wearing a Mae West?
- Yes.
- How long in the water?
- Two, three days.
It rather depends on
the information I get from you.
I would say your best bet would be
someone who died of pneumonia.
When somebody dies of pneumonia...
there's a certain amount
of fluid in the lungs.
After a few days in the water,
it would be almost impossible...
to say that he'd
not died of drowning.
That is, unless one
had reason to be suspicious.
You mean, if you were suspicious
you'd probably spot it?
I would, if it came here.
But I don't suppose
it  come here, would it?
I don't want to ask
any awkward questions...
but at what sort of place
might this body be found?
Shall we say... Spain.
You wouldn't have any trouble there.
I don't think there's anyone in Spain...
who would examine the body closely enough
to spot the sort of thing that I have in mind.
One other thing, Sir Bernard.
If we had to keep the body
for a week or two...
how would we stop it
from decomposing?
Refrigeration.
I would suggest some sort of
airtight canister packed with dry ice.
Why dry ice?
It would melt and give off carbon dioxide
which would dispel the air.
It's the oxygen in air
that causes decomposition.
It would be possible to store a body
in a canister in this way for quite a while.
Well, thank you very much.
That gives me a start.
Sir Bernard, you won't mind if we
come back to you on some of these points?
By all means.
Incidentally,
on this question of refrigeration...
you'd better have a word with my man Adams,
the fellow who brought you in.
He has all the facilities here...
and I can arrange for him
to look after things for you.
That would help a great deal.
If I were in your place, I shouldn't be able
to resist asking what all this is about.
Lieutenant Acres,
if you  in my place...
you would have to remember
what we used to be told in the nursery.
Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies.
Go on, George.
Good-bye.
Thank you very much.
Well, so far, so good.
That part of it seems to be practical anyway,
provided we can get a body.
Oh, any decent undertaker
will fix us up with a body.
I don't think that's a problem.
So that in essence, sir,
the idea is this:
The body of a dead man,
dressed as an officer...
will be put into the sea
from a submarine off the coast of Spain...
near Huelva.
On the body will be
top secret documents...
or a letter suggesting
our main attack will be Greece...
not Sicily.
The body will drift ashore.
It will be picked up
and the papers found.
The impression will be
that it is the body of an officer...
who was traveling by plane...
and was drowned
when his plane crashed into the sea.
Hmm.
- Why Huelva?
- Two reasons, sir.
First, there are strong inshore currents...
and a prevailing onshore wind...
which will almost certainly
carry the body ashore.
Second, one of the sharpest German agents
in Spain operates in that district.
But the beauty of the whole scheme, sir,
is that it involves only one man...
and therefore might be possible...
in the ridiculously
short time allowed us.
May I have your views, sir?
In over 30 years of intelligence work
I've never heard of anything like it.
Neither have the Germans.
It's the most outrageous, disgusting,
preposterous, not to say barbaric idea.
But work out full details...
and be on hand at the war cabinet offices
at 4:30 tomorrow afternoon.
Thank you, sir.
You'll need a code name.
You can have... Jumbo,
Trader, Wigwam...
—
With your permission, sir, Mincemeat.
Operation Mincemeat.
Comments and criticisms. Admiral.
Well, it's an ingenious idea,
of course.
Up to now, I've thought of four major ways
where it could go wrong.
Four?
I was going to say 40.
First, your body may not oblige
by drifting ashore.
Next, it may simply be handed over
to the British consul for burial.
And finally, if they do leak to the Germans,
the Germans may guess they're a fake.
That's all quite true, of course.
There are ways
in which it can go wrong.
But that is so of any operation of war,
and certainly any deception plan.
- Dickie.
- I'm for the idea in principle.
But why not the south of France?
Sir, perhaps you would allow Lt. Cmdr. Montagu,
who put forward the idea...
to answer
Adm. Mountbatten's question.
The reason for choosing Spain, sir...
is that we don't want
the Germans themselves to get the body...
because we don't want it
examined too closely.
But forgive me, even if we could
get over these obvious snags...
surely we're being far too ambitious.
The man might be carrying letters
at a lower level...
but you can't expect the Germans to swallow
fake letters from the vice chief to Gen. Alexander.
Montagu, surely the first question
German intelligence will ask themselves...
is why the letter wasn't sent
through the normal channels...
instead of by this—
this dead gentleman.
It was my intention, sir...
to ask for a letter of a personal and private type
from you to General Alexander.
It might contain
certain references to other people...
which you would hardly want
to go through ordinary channels.
You mean saying someone important
is a nitwit or something.
-
- Yes, sir.
There are, in fact, a number of jokes
already in circulation that might be suitable.
Why is this officer flying to Africa?
Where is he going?
What's his job?
We'd like to make him a major
in the Royal Marines, sir...
on your staff at Combined Operations.
He's an expert on landing craft.
You are lending him
to General Eisenhower...
to whom he also carries a letter.
- Oh, I write a letter as well?
- Yes, sir.
He seems to have jobs for all of us.
- Can my letter be rude about somebody too?
-
You realize that
if the Germans see through this...
you're pinpointing Sicily
as the place where we  going.
- Quite right.
- We've got a big agenda. We must get on.
This is an imaginative plan...
but obviously it needs careful consideration
or we may do more harm than good.
The time is very short, sir,
and we must get going as soon as possible.
We're aware of that.
We'll put it on the agenda
for the next meeting.
I have a feeling it would be easier
to convince the Germans...
than it is to persuade our masters.
It's no use losing your temper.
They've got a lot of other things to think about.
Then why can't they make up their minds
and give us a plain yes or no?
They want to mull it over,
quite rightly.
You'll just have to be patient. The moment
they agree, if they do, you can go ahead.
Till then, you'll just have to wait.
Sticky?
Like trying to swim
through a barrel of syrup.
They just want to stand
and chew their cud...
and gaze into the distance
with big, brown eyes.
What are we supposed to do,
get on with our knitting?
I'll wager that in the end
they won't turn it down.
I'm going to take a chance
and jump the gun.
You go and get a body.
I'll start working out
drawings for a canister.
Mosquitoes.
One engine.
He'll be lucky if he makes it.
- Larry.
- You all right?
Port engine cracked up,
and Steve's had it.
- Steve?
- Just outside Brussels.
Light flak.
He went down fast.
Didn't have time to bail out.
Hello?
Hello?
Joe?
I was on my way back.
I saw them come in.
Are you all right, Joey?
I'm all right, baby.
I'm fine.
It was an easy one.
Oh...
I'm glad.
- 4-3-9.
- Is Commander Montagu there?
- Yes, sir. He's here now, sir.
- Thank you.
- Hello?
- Commander Montagu?
- Yes?
- General Nye wants to talk to you.
- Thank you.
-  Montagu?
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.
Montagu, I want you to be at 10 Downing Street
tomorrow morning at 10:30.
Of course, sir.
Tomorrow morning at 10:30.
I'll be there.
It's going up to the prime minister.
—
- Sir?
Thank you, sir.
All right, Montagu,
you've got the all-clear.
And your submarine's fixed.
- Jewell is sailing in  for Malta on Friday.
- Jewell?
He's the man who put Mark Clark ashore
in Africa and rescued General Giraud...
so you're in good hands.
- Can you make it?
- I assure you, sir, we shall make it.
Good.
Carry on.
Yes, I'll hold on.
George, it's on. We've got the right of way
from the old man himself.
"Let the plan be implemented!"
I knew he wouldn't shoot it down.
May I ask what you're up to?
I've got a socking great blister
on my foot.
I've walked more than 50 miles
in the last two days...
I didn't go to bed at all last night...
and it doesn't matter whether
he shoots it down or not...
because the whole thing
is utterly impracticable.
- What?
- Napoo. Won't go. Not on.
- Hello? Yes.
- Why not?
Because, Monty, there simply
isn't any way of getting a body.
You wave an airy hand and say, "George, go and
get a body," as though there was nothing to it.
- Well, you try.
- Nonsense!
There are hospitals,
nursing homes, mortuaries—
- I've tried 'em! Not a hope.
- Is he at the hospital now?
You see, Monty,
every body belongs to somebody...
and it isn't a thing
people want messed about.
What about the fellow
in St. Luke's Hospital?
Changed his mind
at the last moment and recovered.
- Very unreliable type.
- Yes, we'll come round immediately.
- Have you tried Spilsbury?
- Yes, he gets bodies.
But they're special ones that the police
think have been murdered...
and he wants them himself.
- Sir, I think I'm onto something.
- Where?
In a small hospital
in St. John's Wood.
I said you'd come and see the father.
There doesn't seem to be anybody else.
- When did he die?
- 3:00 this morning.
- Pneumonia?
- Bronchial pneumonia.
Are there any other relatives
beside the father?
I don't think so. He was an only child,
and I gather the wife's dead.
- Is the father with him now?
- He is waiting for you.
You wait here.
I think I'd rather
deal with this by myself.
Perhaps you'd like to sit over there
while you're waiting.
- Thank you.
- I'll come back in a few minutes.
Right.
It has been explained to you...
that, for reasons of security...
we cannot tell you
why we are asking you this?
Yes.
That has been explained.
But if there is any question
you wish to ask me, sir...
I will answer it if I can.
I'll try not to embarrass you.
Can you assure me,
Commander Montagu...
as an officer and a gentleman...
that if I agree to your request...
my son's body will be treated decently
and with respect?
I give you my word.
His name will never be revealed?
Never.
And finally...
his body will have Christian burial?
I cannot absolutely promise that...
but I am fairly certain of it.
I was never the one...
nor was he...
to mind very much about
the last resting place of the body...
being more concerned
with the repose of the spirit.
But still...
I would like to be sure
that this thing you are going to do...
is good...
and worthy of him.
I can assure you that...
this is an opportunity for your son
to do a great thing for England.
My son, sir, was a Scotsman...
and very proud of it.
I beg your pardon.
Never mind.
We're used to that.
You English always talk about England
when you mean Britain.
Good-bye, son.
I don't know what they want with you...
but it doesn't matter now...
because...
you're not here anymore.
You're somewhere else...
and at peace.
Good day to you.
I have no son now...
but you have a body.
I think William Martin
is a good name.
One naval identity card...
in the name of
Captain, Acting Major, William Martin...
Royal Marines.
Born in Cardiff, 1907.
I thought of Glasgow,
but I don't want to say he's a Scot.
Also, a combined Operations Headquarters
pass in the same name.
You'll need a photograph of him, sir,
for the identity card.
So we shall.
It's only a passport photograph.
It needn't look like him.
Now, we need various articles
to go in his pockets—
cigarettes, matches, bunch of keys—
- What's he carrying the documents in?
- Briefcase.
But he's floating in the water.
Has he got it in his hand, or what?
What about one of those things
that bank messengers have?
Goes around the waist, comes down
the sleeve and clips onto the briefcase.
Get one, and we'll see.
And he'll have to have
a wallet, money, wristwatch.
- George.
- Hmm?
I think we're attacking this
the wrong way round.
Wallet, money, wristwatch,
they're all right and necessary.
But, after all,
he must have had some private life.
There ought to be something
more intimate on him when they find him.
Personal things like photographs
or maybe some private letters.
I'll tell you what. He'd better have
a girlfriend with a love letter from her.
That's a good idea, but we'll have
to make it really convincing.
Hmm.
We'll get Pam to write it for us.
You wouldn't mind, would you?
I'll do anything I can
to help with the work, sir.
- Hang on a minute. I'll be back.
I won't come up, Lu.
There isn't time.
All right.
Good-bye, Joey.
Now, remember, you're my girl now.
Official.
I won't ever forget.
Hi, Pam.
How goes it?
Little bit tired.
Pam, I've got some news for you...
and maybe it's going
to make you angry.
Tell me later, Lucy,
when I've done this.
Okay.
I'll go make some coffee.
It's already done.
It's on the hot plate.
That's what I like about you—
you're so inefficient.
- You want some?
- No, thanks.
"Dearest Willie"?
Have you ever tried writing? That's the
greatest opening I've ever heard in my life.
Don't fool.
It isn't a real letter.
It's just something I've got to do.
Love letters are always something
you've got to do. What's it for then?
It's part of a story
I've got to make up.
Well, let me help you. I'm completely
undiscovered and cheap. My work, I mean.
- What's the story?
- Oh, it's very ordinary.
They've just got engaged.
He's going off on a dangerous job...
and she's writing to him.
Oh, that one.
It's the start that's sticking me.
"Dearest Willie—"
His name's Willie Martin.
"It was lovely seeing you."
Willie Martin.
What a name.
"Dearest Willie."
Take dictation.
Darling...
when you went away tonight...
something went with you.
It's always bad when you go away...
but it was worse tonight...
because the day was so good.
You shouldn't have bought the ring...
and I knew you shouldn't.
And you did because you love me...
and I let you because I love you.
There isn't much more than that
to be had from any day.
I told you I wouldn't.
Because if I did...
that would mean that you were real...
that you belonged to me...
and that they couldn't
take you away from me...
whereas now they can send you away...
and leave me to wonder
if I'll ever see you again...
or whether I may wake up...
and find I'd dreamed you.
Maybe there'll be a time
when it's all over...
and you're still there
and real and lovely.
Then I'll put your ring on
and wear it...
and wear it until I die.
Oh, God, darling,
take care of yourself.
As if you ever could or would.
I suppose I mean...
O God, take care of you.
I love you.
I love you.
This is really wonderful, Pam.
I had no idea you were a writer.
- I'm afraid I didn't do it, sir.
- Oh?
A friend of mine did it.
I only altered a word here and there.
That's why I've signed it Lucy.
- You didn't tell her anything.
- Of course not.
- She did it just for fun?
- Yes, sir.
- Just for fun.
- Good.
- Oh, George, have you seen this?
- Yes.
- I always told you there were hidden depths.
- Mr. Acres, I have—
Never mind, my dear.
It happens to the nicest people.
Oh, by the way, I fixed the letter
from the bank about Willie's overdraft.
The manager was very helpful.
- I told him just enough.
- Fine.
Tell me, does this alleged girlfriend of yours
wear thick spectacles?
No.
- Reasonably good to look at?
- Very.
Ah, then we want her photograph
for Willie's wallet.
- It doesn't have to be her photograph.
I want to see
this passionate Lucy creature.
It's got to look as though
it's been in his pocket for several days.
Can we get a snap of this girl?
- I should think so, sir.
- Good.
Now about dates.
There's got to be something on him
that will show when he left.
I think I can fix to get a receipted bill
from the Naval and Military Club.
He stayed there on his last night.
And he went to the theater.
Final celebration.
He has the stubs of the tickets
in his pocket.
Item: Two theater tickets
for the night of...
April 22.
- Dress circle.
- Make it four.
And for something worth seeing.
And what's going on
in that bright little mind?
You've got to buy the tickets anyway,
and Willie can't use them.
We might as well.
There are three of us already,
and with Pam's alleged girlfriend—
I understand, dear chap.
Mmm.
Make it four.
I've hacked it about a bit,
as we agreed.
It now reads, "General,
the Honorable Sir Harold R.O.G. Alexander.
"My dear Alex, I am taking advantage
of this opportunity...
"to send you a personal letter
by hand of one of Mountbatten's officers...
to put you in the picture regarding
our intention in the Mediterranean."
- Good.
Then, "The plan is that the 5th
and 56th divisions will be reinforced...
and form the main force
for the attack on Greece."
Then a lot about possible landing points.
Then,
"In the western Mediterranean...
"the heavy bombardment
of Sicily will continue...
"as it is necessary
to make the enemy think...
that this island is still
our main objective."
- That's exactly right, sir.
Well, here you are.
Let's hope it foxes them.
- I won't touch it, sir, if you don't mind.
- Why?
I want only two sets of fingerprints on it—
yours and your secretary's.
- What do you want me to do with it then?
- Fold it, sir.
As sharp folds as you can.
Now put it in the envelope.
Now, if you'll wrap a piece of paper
around it so that I can handle it...
I'll take it out to your secretary
and get her to seal it.
- Thank you, sir.
- Any more chores?
No, thank you, sir.
And thank you very much.
Thank you.
- Sorry I'm late. Got his clothes?
- It's there.
- Good. Where's Adams?
- He's gone down.
All ready, Mr. Adams?
Yes, sir.
Identity disks.
Underwear.
- Laundry marks fixed?
- Yes.
Socks and shirt.
- This is new.
- He just bought half a dozen at Gieve's.
- I've got the bill to put in his pocket.
- Right.
Collar and tie.
Awkward doing this on somebody else.
Let me, sir.
Now the uniform.
Trousers.
Things in the pockets first,
or after they're on him?
After.
Blouse.
Shoes.
Not bad.
The crowns on his shoulders
look a bit new.
Now the personal effects.
- One wristwatch.
- Right.
Wallet containing one five-pound note,
three one-pound notes...
letter from bank manager
re overdraft...
book of stamps,
photograph of fiancée.
Correct.
Ten shillings in loose change
to go in right-hand trouser pocket.
- Correct.
Letter from fiancée
to go next to wallet.
Correct.
Bill for six shirts
from Gieve's, Piccadilly...
and receipted bill for a room
at the Naval and Military.
Correct.
Two stubs of tickets
to the Prince of Wales Theater.
Correct.
Cigarettes, matches, bunch of keys.
Correct.
Combined Operations pass and naval
identity card in cellophane container.
- Correct.
- Briefcase.
- I'll fasten the trench coat and Mae West, sir.
- Thank you, Adams.
Apart from the cover stuff
already in there...
letter from General Nye
to General Alexander.
Right.
Letter to General Eisenhower
from Admiral Mountbatten.
Right.
- Shouldn't he have the key?
- He already has one on his key ring.
Well...
I think Major Martin
is ready to go to war.
keep up a steady average to make it.
- Thank you, Adams.
- Thank you.
Attention!
If you can manage
the launching of the body...
with only officers on deck, do so.
The fewer people in the know
the better.
Better all round.
Sailors are a superstitious lot.
What's your cover story for the crew?
I put it round that the canister contains
a special sort of secret weather-reporting buoy.
Well, I think that's the lot.
- And the very best of luck.
- Thank you.
We'll try and do a good job for you.
Carry on, Number One.
- Ah, there we are.
- No sherry, no whiskey, no gin, no rum.
- Well, what's this?
- Egg flip.
I think my alleged friend
wants a light.
Why am I always
your "alleged" friend?
- George has never been quite sure you exist.
- Oh, I exist, all right.
- That's about all I do.
- There's no doubt about that.
This is very interesting.
From his attitude in the office, one would
never suspect George was such a fast worker.
You should see him
in the typist's office.
George, I think
we ought to drink to the major.
- Oh, we must.
- Yes. He's the chap who got us the seats.
He couldn't come.
Well, I don't know the major, but I'm quite sure
he won't mind me drinking to his health.
He's probably a grand boy.
Let's drink the health of all the majors
and all the commanders...
and all the lieutenants.
The major. May he have
a safe and successful journey.
- The major.
- The major.
- Steady as you go.
All right, my beauties.
Not long now.
- Okay, Sub. Get going.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Up periscope.
Blast those fishermen.
Haven't they got any homes?
Down periscope.
Stand by to surface.
Tackle!
- Hooked up!
- Take the weight!
Steady.
Steady does it.
Boats.
Dinghy first.
Unto Almighty God we commend the soul
of this, our brother departed...
and we commit his body to the deep.
The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away.
- Blessed be the name of the Lord.
-  Amen.
All right, chaps.
Come on.
Canister party back on casing.
Canister party on casing.
All right.
Down below.
-  9-8-7.
- Yes.
- Montagu?
- Yes.
This is D.N.I.
Scramble, will you?
I've got a bit of news for you.
The major's arrived.
I've just received a signal.
The vice-counsul at Huelva
is very worried.
He says the body carried
what looked like an official briefcase...
and he's pulling every string
to retrieve it.
Let's hope he doesn't
pull too hard, sir.
Yes. But I think it might help
to keep the ball rolling if I make a signal...
telling him to get hold of it at all costs.
If it was genuine, that would be
the natural thing to do, wouldn't it?
Good.
Meantime,
I'll put Major Martin in the casualty lists.
- That's the first thing they'll check.
- Right.
-
-
-
- Amen.
Amen.
I called on the magistrate
before the funeral.
All Major Martin's belongings
have been returned.
- And the briefcase?
- Yes, and the briefcase.
Good.
The lazy, incompetent beggars.
Doesn't anything ever penetrate
those Prussian skulls?
The net result
of Operation Mincemeat so far...
seems to be that
we've lost two bob.
Everything else is horribly intact.
Of course, sir,
there are ways of opening letters...
apart from using a knife
with marmalade on it...
and ways of closing them again.
I'd like to hear
what the scientific boys have to say.
Agreed.
- Well?
- Course, this has been in water.
Yes?
- Seawater.
- Yes.
It makes it very difficult when things
have been in water, particularly seawater.
- Well, can you tell us anything?
- I'm afraid very little.
You see, when the thing's been in water,
seawater, it obscures so much.
- But do you think it's been opened?
- Opened?
Oh, yes, it's been opened.
Oh, yes, it's been opened.
It has been opened?
And closed again by somebody
who knows his business.
It's been stretched out on a flat surface
and held lightly at the corners...
probably to be photographed.
- I only wish I could be more helpful.
- You've done splendidly.
That's all we had to know.
Well?
- Mincemeat swallowed whole.
- Mincemeat?
Well?
There's nothing new
from Madrid, Herr Admiral.
The führer has told his conference
that the documents...
are undoubtedly genuine.
- You mean he doesn't doubt them.
- He's quite sure.
The führer, of course,
has certain advantages...
over mere intelligence officers
like you and me, Frederik.
He has his intuition...
whereas we have to
rely on our brains.
- And he's sure God is on his side.
- But you are not?
I do not believe
that God is on my side to the extent...
of handing me the enemy's plans.
There's no way in which we can check
the genuineness of these papers.
The question is whether
what is in the letters is true.
And only the people
who wrote them could tell us.
But we can do something...
to check the genuineness of the bearer.
In what sense, Herr Admiral?
We know a great deal about
the lamented Major Martin, Frederik.
We know the address
of his club, of his bank.
We even know about his debts.
I think someone had better ask
a few discreet questions in London...
just to make sure
there was such a man.
- From Dublin, Mr. O'Reilly?
- That's right.
- How long are you staying?
- Uh, three days.
- London?
- Yeah.
- Business?
- Yes.
- All right. Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Is this all your luggage?
- Uh, yes.
- Will you read this notice, please?
- I have.
- Have you any articles subject to duty?
- No.
All right.
I'll open this one up.
All right. Thank you.
Shut it up again.
Is this all your luggage, madam?
Will you read this notice, please?
Do you have any articles
subject to duty?
Will you drive me to Number 57
Landsmere Gardens, please?
All right. Step in.
I trust you had a pleasant journey.
I am here with thee and thy goats.
- Where from?
- Dublin.
If you look over your head,
you'll see a plate with a telephone number.
Memorize it,
but don't write it down.
If it's absolutely necessary,
but not otherwise...
ring that number for a cab to pick you up
outside the south entrance...
to the tube station at Hyde Park Corner.
Go straight there and wait for me.
But don't ring unless it's important.
You're not under my orders.
I'm not responsible for you,
and I have troubles enough of my own.
My instructions simply are to meet you
and deliver you and your luggage. That's all.
I doubt if I shall bother you much.
It's nothing to do with me,
but why were you chosen for this job?
Because I'm so fond of the English.
Yes, they are a loveable people.
Your other bag, sir.
- Thank you.
- Three and sixpence on the clock, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Jolly good luck, sir.
- Uh, yes?
- My name's O'Reilly.
I believe you have a room for me.
- Oh, you're the gentleman from Dublin?
- That's right.
- Oh, yes. Of course. Will you come in, please?
- Thank you.
Well, I'll take you straight up, shall I?
Give me one of your cases.
Oh, I can manage.
- Never let it be said I let a lady carry for me.
- Oh, you're all the same.
I always say there's
nobody like the Irish for manners.
My granddad was Irish.
He came from the north.
But as he said,
"What does it matter, north or south?
We're all Irish,
and all the Irish are kings' sons."
Now, look,
I've put you on the first floor here.
That's the bathroom and the necessary,
and this is your room.
I do hope you'll be comfortable.
I expect you'd like a cup of tea, wouldn't you?
I can make you one quite easily.
Oh, no, thank you.
I'll just get on and unpack my things.
Do you know I had the police
round three times about it last week?
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be very careful.
Well, I'll leave you to yourself now.
Oh, I almost forgot.
In case you should want to be out late in the
evening, I'll put the key on the hall table.
And if there's anything else you want, just call
"coo-ee" over the banisters and I'll pop up.
Thank you.
Polar... bear.
Polar... bear.
Stand by tonight.
Well, the tie.
The darkish blue goes with this suit.
Yes, with pinstripes
right through it, if we can.
Thank you very much, sir.
Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.
- Uh, um, I'd like some khaki shirts, please.
- Made to measure or ready-made, sir?
- Ready-made.
- Collar size?
- Sixteen.
I think you'll like these, sir.
They're very fine poplin.
Practically prewar quality.
- Oh, yes, yes. They're very nice indeed.
- It's a beautiful shirt, sir.
- But they're not really the ones I had in mind.
- No, sir?
No, you sold some to a friend of mine
a few weeks ago.
Um, Major William Martin
of the Royal Marines.
- They were cotton with separate collars.
- I know the one you mean.
Just take a look at those, will you, sir?
Separate collars. Cotton.
- Oh, good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
- Won't keep you a moment.
- Right.
- Yes, these look like the ones.
- Good, sir.
But I'm not quite sure.
Uh, would it be troubling you too much
to look up Major Martin's account—
Look, sir, if your friend
got his shirts from us...
and if they were cotton with separate collars,
those are certainly the ones.
- We haven't any others in stock.
- Oh.
Well, I'll not doubt the word
of an honest man.
- I'll take two.
- Thank you very much, sir.
—
- Excuse me.
- Is this the Naval and Military Club?
- Yes, that's right.
- Thank you.
- Well, you might as well scrap the whole idea.
I wonder if you could help me.
I wonder if you could help me.
I'll do my best, sir.
I'm looking for a friend of mine,
Major Martin.
Major William Martin
of the Royal Marines.
I believe he's a member here.
Do you happen to have seen him lately
or know his whereabouts?
Major Martin.
There's a Major Martin who's a gunner, sir.
No, that'd hardly be him.
He's in the Royal Marines.
- Eh?
- The Royal Marines!
I don't think I know
the gentleman personally, sir.
Is he a regular officer or temporary?
Oh, now, there I couldn't be sure.
If he's a temporary,
I probably shouldn't know him, sir.
There's a lot of members now
that I don't know.
"Martin, Brigadier A.T."
"Martin, Captain L."
"Martin, Major W., R.A."
No, sir. No Major Martin
what's a marine here, sir.
- Now, surely that's odd if he's a member.
- Eh?
- Surely that's odd if he's a member!
- Not necessarily, sir.
What with the bomb damage and no staff,
we're a bit behind with things these days.
If he's a new member,
he may not be on the file yet.
You could leave a message. Then if he
comes in, I'll personally see he gets it.
No, thanks.
It can wait.
- I'm grateful to you, all the same.
- Eh?
I'm grateful to ya, all the same!
Oh. Thank you, sir.
Will you hold on a moment, please?
There's the contract you asked for.
And there's a Mr. Phillips who'd
like to speak to you on the phone.
- What does he want?
- He's making inquiries about a Major Martin.
- About who?
- A Major Martin.
Put him through.
Stay on the line and get
a shorthand note of what we say.
Yes, Mr. Emberton.
Switchboard.
- There's a call on my outside line.
- Yes, sir?
- Get through to the exchange and have it traced.
- Yes, sir.
- Hello.
- Is that the manager?
Speaking.
I-I wonder if you could help me.
My name is Phillips, and I'm making
some inquiries about Major William Martin.
- Yes?
- I believe he was a customer of yours.
Only the poor fellow's dead,
and as an old friend...
I'm trying to help clear up his affairs.
I see.
I'm sure you'll understand it's an absolute rule
of the bank not to discuss a client's affairs...
with anyone
but his accredited representatives.
Certainly not on the telephone.
But I am onto the right branch,
I take it.
I should have thought the best thing
would be if you could drop in and see me.
I'm pretty full up this morning,
but this afternoon's all right...
if you'd like to come in at, say,
quarter past 2:00 and ask for me.
Yes. Yes, I suppose
that would be a good idea.
- A quarter past 2:00.
- Yes.
All right.
You were very smart
to get this, Mr. Emberton.
My secretary often takes notes
of important calls.
You say he had a slight accent?
Yes, but, uh, not a foreign accent,
if you follow me.
It's difficult to tell on the telephone.
I should have said he was English,
but possibly from the west country.
- Did you trace the call?
- It came from a public telephone booth.
Obviously, yet when you
suggested an appointment, he agreed.
He agreed, but he didn't sound
particularly enthusiastic.
Is there any chance
that this might be a coincidence?
William Martin is quite a common name.
He may have just mistaken the bank.
- It's possible, but—
- But not probable.
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Emberton.
You've handled the whole thing beautifully.
Frankly, I don't think
the man will turn up.
However, we can't afford to take any chances.
We'll both be back at 2:00.
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Thank you.
- He's a good chap.
- Very good.
Look, George, if there's somebody around
who can ring up Willie Martin's bank...
it means thatJerry's putting the whole thing
under a microscope.
Now, where, if anywhere,
is there a weak link?
I'm going to Scotland Yard to talk
to General Colbourne of the special branch.
Of course, a voice from a telephone booth
isn't much of a starting point.
I realize that, sir.
I wondered whether you'd had any ripple on
the waters recently that might give us a line.
I don't think so.
There's a gentleman just arrived from Sweden
we're rather interested in...
but he's nothing to do
with your Major Martin.
It's certain he won't come to the bank, but we'd
better have a couple of your men just in case.
Yes, of course.
We must certainly be in on it.
We always like to make
a new friend if we can.
Besides, you may be wrong.
He may turn up.
My guess is that he's only over here
for this one job.
He knows we haven't
got our tabs on him.
He's the sort of man
who might take chances.
- We'll get back and stand by.
- Right.
Pity. Do you think
he suspected Emberton?
I don't know, but it's obvious
he can't afford to show himself.
- Hello?
-  Is that the American Library?
- Yes.
- Can I speak to Miss Sherwood, please?
Just a moment.
Lucy, it's for you, and you really must get him
to ring up out of working hours.
I'm sorry. I'll tell him.
Hello? Hello, Joe?
Lucy, this is Larry.
- Hello, Larry.
- You know why I'm phoning, don't you, Lu?
Sure. Sure.
Oh, no, he's gone.
I guess I knew it would come.
Thank you, Larry.
You all right?
Yes, he was a good flyer.
Thank you for ringing, Larry.
-
- Good evening.
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but the door was open.
Yes.
What do you want?
I'm making some inquiries
about a friend of mine, William Martin.
- William Martin?
- Yes.
- Yes, will you come in?
- Thank you.
Won't you sit down?
Willie's death was a great shock to me.
Yes, it was a great pity.
Forgive me, but I take it
you're not his fiancée.
No. I hardly knew him.
Only I understood
he'd just recently become engaged...
and that his fiancée
lived at this address.
That's why I came.
Yes, well, that's the girl who
lives here with me— Lucy Sherwood.
Oh, will you have a cigarette?
Thank you.
Lucy Sherwood.
That's right. I remember.
I'll get you a light.
I should have liked to see her.
- I'm afraid she's out tonight.
- When will she be back?
Not until late, but if you could
come again tomorrow...
I'd say that you'd called
and that you'd be coming back.
Yes.
I knew Willie right from the time
when he was a boy in Cardiff.
Did he come from Cardiff?
I didn't know.
Is his fiancée very upset?
Well, naturally.
Well, I don't want to take up your time...
but I do want to—
to do everything I can to help.
So if you would like to give his fiancée
my name and address—
- Your address?
- Yes.
Perhaps you'd care to take it down.
My name is Patrick O'Reilly.
R-E-I-double L-Y.
And my address is
North West 1.
I am to be found there any time.
Right.
-
Oh. Sorry.
Don't mind me.
I'm just passing through.
You're Miss Lucy Sherwood?
That's right.
Well, go on. Where's your manners, Pam?
Introduce your handsome friend.
- Lucy, this is Mr. Patrick O'Reilly.
- Hello there.
Mr. O'Reilly is making inquiries
about Willie Martin.
Willie Martin?
Willie Martin.
Dearest Willie?
It's no good making inquiries
about him, mister.
Willie Martin doesn't exist.
At least he's dead,
which is the same thing.
That's right, isn't it?
That's true.
It's the same with all these boys.
Here today, gone tomorrow.
What's real about that?
I was very sorry to hear of his death.
Why should you be sorry?
You weren't in love
with him, were you?
He didn't give you a ring.
I never wore it.
- Lucy.
- I knew him in the old days in Cardiff.
Did you, now?
And I'll bet you knew his old man too.
His ma and his sister
and the whole shooting match.
Well, I didn't.
They were just photographs.
The usual photographs
with folks looking the way folks do.
But I never knew 'em.
In the time, I barely knew
Three months.
What sort of time's that?
And yet I knew him well enough.
And then they took him away from me...
and killed him in the sea.
"Down, down into the sea...
to be lost evermore in the main."
Why should you?
Why should I know Tennyson?
He almost made it.
Darling, I dreamed you.
I was always afraid I had.
Always afraid.
Lucy, darling,
I really think you ought to go to bed.
Bed? What for?
There's plenty of time to go to bed.
Years and years with nothing else to do
and nowheres else to go.
And everything cold and ended.
Oh, why can't you all go away
and let me alone?
- ##
-
- Is she all right?
- Yes, I think so.
But I really must get her to bed.
I'm sorry I've intruded.
You have my address.
Yes.
Lucy. Lucy.
Polar... bear.
Polar... bear.
Martin probably...
genuine...
but to be certain...
have deliberately...
revealed... my identity...
to enemy.
Stand by...
for confirmation...
in one hour.
have been arrested...
therefore...
Martin false.
Come on.
- He had it all pat?
- Yes, about Cardiff and everything.
- Here's the address that he gave me.
- What's he like?
Tall, dark, Irish-sounding,
good-looking, about 30.
I'd like to get that description
to General Colbourne.
- May I use the phone?
- It's in there.
What chance that he believed you?
I don't know. I wasn't very good.
I wasn't ready for it.
- But he believed Lucy.
- You really think so?
Yes. He believed her, all right.
I saw his face.
- To Lucy it was true.
- For heaven's sake, don't start blubbering.
- How long did he stay?
- About 10 minutes.
I told him it was Lucy
that he wanted.
And you didn't get anything out of him
that would even give us a lead?
Now, steady, Monty. She got his name
and address. That wasn't too bad.
I didn't even have to get that.
He gave it to me.
General Colbourne wants us
to go round to this address and check.
- He's sending more men.
- Is there such an address?
Oh, yes.
It's a waste of time,
but I don't see what else we can do.
Don't worry.
It's all right.
- Leave one of your men to cover the apartment.
- Right then.
You lead.
- Good night, George.
- Cheerio, old boy.
Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.
I beg your pardon.
Why should he bother
to give Pam a phony address?
Why? Why?
Unless— George, I'm off my head.
Stop the car.
- No, get after French and stop him.
- Well, make up your mind.
- Hurry, man! Hurry!
- Blow your horn, you idiot. Blow your horn.
-
Let's stop rushing around like buffalo
and use our brain, if we have any.
Aren't I working for you anymore?
What is all this?
- What's the matter, sir?
- French, we're making fools of ourselves.
I'm inclined to agree with you, but Colbourne
feels we shouldn't take any chances.
- He thinks he might be there.
- That's just the point.
- He is there. I'm certain of it.
- Shouldn't we get on?
French, I want you to take your men
to the house and cover it.
Don't be spotted and don't do
anything else until I tell you.
- And if our man comes out, sir?
- Don't worry about that.
I'm quite sure he won't.
Off you go, and, mind you,
no action without further orders.
- You don't want us to scoop him up?
- That's exactly what I mean.
I'm sorry, sir,
but my orders from General—
I don't give a damn what your orders are.
You do as I say.
- I'll talk to Gen. Colbourne.
- Thank you very much, Commander.
- French, you have my orders. Carry them out.
- Yes, sir.
Just a minute, sir. Before those orders go
through, will you listen for one moment?
Montagu, you're taking
too much upon yourself.
The man almost certainly isn't there,
but if he is, he won't be there for long.
- Every moment we waste—
- Sir, he is there.
Then why are you trying
to countermand my orders?
General Colbourne,
if you send your men to the house...
you will arrest one spy,
and we may lose 30,000 men.
I ask you to send French
to cover the house and do no more...
until I've had a chance to explain.
- You're uncommonly sure of yourself.
- I'm sure of nothing, sir.
But I've used what few brains I have...
and now I must stand
by what they tell me.
Your decision, sir.
French, cover the house
and wait for further orders
Yes, sir.
- Well, now, Commander?
- I'd prefer not to talk about it in the street, sir.
- ##
- What I'm asking you to assume, sir, is...
that that address is genuine.
- If so, what happens?
- We pick him up.
Suppose he doesn't mind that?
People usually mind being shot.
Suppose he's prepared to risk his life
to be sure about Willie Martin.
If we turn up at that address,
it can only mean that we've been tipped off...
and that the whole
Martin story is a plant.
This man will have committed suicide...
butJerry will know the answer...
and our operation will be blown.
I'm sorry, sir.
We mustn't touch him. We daren't.
You mean, till after we think
he's got a message through.
No, sir.
Right up till the time of the landings.
Because the fact that there have been no further
messages from him might give the game away.
You realize he'll probably be
out of the country in a couple of days.
Yes, and we must let him go.
After all, he's done us no harm.
Masterly inactivity.
They also serve
who only stand and wait.
Polar... bear.
Polar bear.
Martin genuine.
