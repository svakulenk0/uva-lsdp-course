At ease, Staff Sergeant.
Staff Sergeant,
do you like unicorns?
Um...
Yes, sir, I guess
I like unicorns all right.
What are you,
some kind of faggot?
No, sir.
I'm just messing with you.
Just messing around.
I've been hearing a little bit
about your squad today,
Staff Sergeant.
Your lieutenant here tells
me that you and your men
are relatively competent.
Fortunately, for the task
at hand, relative competence
is probably sufficient.
Intel's got reports
of al-Qaeda using a road
to transport equipment.
You and your men will
set up camp nearby,
report any activity.
To engage if necessary.
Lieutenant, here,
will fill you in with
all further details.
You're dismissed,
Staff Sergeant.
CHARD: Hey, how sweaty do
you think them bitches are
underneath them sheets?
They wouldn't get none
of that on the fruit,
you don't think, right?
If I get one of them
oranges, or something.
BOY: Biscuit. Biscuit.
Biscuit. Biscuit.
- Go away.
Hey. Hey, hey.
- No! Get the fuck
away from me.
Biscuit. Biscuit.
- Get the fuck
away from me.
Biscuit. Biscuit.
- No.
You have a biscuit?
- No biscuit.
Hey, how's "biscuit" like
one of the three English
words these kids know?
Biscuit. Biscuit.
Biscuit. Biscuit.
No, no biscuit.
I don't have
a fucking biscuit! Fuck off!
JEFF: Hey, Chard.
Chard, chill. All right?
Hey. Here, it's not
a biscuit, but... Hey!
CHARD: Fucking ingrates.
Give them an inch,
they'll take a mile.
They're just kids.
Real bad, Davies.
See how you do against
a haji over 10.
Get your ass in
the back of the truck.
TINO: No, see, because girls
have it reversed. They have
a reverse to it, all right?
Guys got the angry pirate.
Girls got the angry penguin.
What's the angry penguin?
TINO:
All right, so check this out.
If a girl's down and she's
blowing you, you know,
she's wailing out, doing
her thing, and you're like
just about to bust,
and like me, you know
I'm always like,
"I'm going to come,"
you know, 'cause I want
to say it, just 'cause
I'm a gentleman.
So as you say that, she stops.
Now your pants are
around your ankles.
She stops and just
walks out the room. So now
you're the angry penguin
'cause you're walking around
and your feet are together,
and your face is like,
"Oh, my God..."
You're fucked up.
TINO: It's like...
Boy, no, Chard,
check it out. Check it out.
I got one for you. I got one.
Move it!
- It's an IED.
Go, now!
What? What?
See anything?
I can't see anything.
We just got to ride it out.
MAN: Go! Go!
Otus 3 Papa.
This is Otus 3 Papa. Over.
MARCUS: Shit.
Repeat. Repeat, over!
MARCUS: Otus 3 actual,
be advised you are coming
in broken and unreadable.
Come again, over.
Stop the truck!
- What?
MARCUS: Stop the truck!
Thank you. 360!
Wardell, you stay.
MARCUS: This is Otus 3 Papa.
All units on this net,
this is Otus 3 Papa.
Radio check, over.
You want us in?
Roger that. Otus 3 Papa, out.
Keller!
Yeah.
Lieutenant wants us
to survey this area here.
They're en route
to our position now.
Back here in 15 minutes,
sooner if you see anything.
Got it?
Yes, Staff Sergeant.
All right, you heard
the man. Let's move out.
JEFF: Why would all this
be out here in the
middle of nowhere?
CHARD: Maybe they diverted
the camel path or something.
JEFF: Yeah, right.
CHARD: Who knows why these
people do anything out here.
It's fucking weird.
TINO: What is it, Wilcox?
How should I know?
You're the one who
speaks Dari and went
to college and shit.
It's a...
Maybe some sort
of idol, right?
I mean, Islamic law
pretty much forbids
the worship of images,
so maybe that's why
this is hidden in here.
There's all different
stories here about demons,
shape shifters and Djinn.
You know, like spirits that
are caught inside of lamps.
Aladdin.
GREGORY: No.
The stuff is in
the Koran even.
So what is it then?
Djinn were supposedly made
by God from smokeless flame.
So they have no
shape or form, and they
pretty much hate people.
So they have to be
imprisoned in objects,
or they'll just go
around killing us.
TREVOR: Motherfucker. If you
had missed and shot one of us,
or if you had even got
a grain of sand in my eye,
I would have fucked you up.
I wasn't going to miss,
asshole. Jesus!
Damn. That thing is old.
TINO: Good fucking job, Chard.
What the fuck are
you talking about?
That was a good shot.
That thing's been here like
hundreds of years till
your dumb ass came along.
You could say the same
damn thing about every foot
of this fucking desert.
JEFF: All right, all right.
Let's head back. See if any
orders have come down.
JEFF: Yo, Gregory.
TREVOR: He's probably
waiting to see
if we're gonna
get three wishes now,
or something.
CHARD: Hey, those wishes
are rightfully mine, fuckers.
Welcome to your new home.
Hollister, they got
the supplies they need?
Yes, sir.
Fill them in.
All right. For the next few
days, our section is gonna
set up operations here.
Our main objective is
to monitor this road.
Report all activity.
Do you see a road?
- No.
MARCUS: Wilcox?
You've got first watch.
CHARD: Hey, Staff Sergeant.
Yeah?
There's only
seven of us here.
Your point, Davies?
JEFF: I think what Davies is
trying to say is that if
there are any Talibs nearby,
they might see us
as potential targets.
Well, that would be
a sure-fire way
of finding out if there
are any Talibs around,
wouldn't it?
Have a great stay, ladies.
Shit! God damn it.
God damn.
You know what to do.
I'll get you some shovels.
Get it done before they
finish unloading the truck.
And get all this
shit out of here.
We're not using it.
Well, that's a relief.
What happened
to these people?
TREVOR: White phosphorus
does that.
You get hit with it, it burns
right through to the bone.
Bomb must have hit
just as they were
sitting down to dinner.
TREVOR: Come on, man.
You get the top.
I'll get the legs.
Should we say something?
Like what?
I don't know.
JEFF: Hey, dawg,
why don't you go
turn off the light?
CHARD: No, no, no.
Yo, Keller.
TREVOR: I'm not even tired.
You looking at
pictures of your girl?
TINO: What's weird shit
you've done to her?
JEFF: I will not be
getting into that.
TREVOR: All you motherfuckers
need to be locked up
in a cage.
Shut up,
shut up. You ever get
a blumpkin from your girl?
JEFF: What the hell
is a blumpkin?
TINO: You ever... Like,
let's say you eat a tacquito
or something like that,
and you're sitting on
the toilet and then
she comes up and...
JEFF: Oh, no.
TINO: Gives you a blow job
while you're shitting.
I'm gonna get sick
sitting next to this
sexual predator.
TINO: Come on, it's a
real thing that people do.
You did this?
CHARD: He spends too
much time on the Internet.
Yeah, sick motherfucker.
TINO: You were totally
into that,
and I'm not saying
I've done it.
You've done it.
TINO: But...
So she...
TINO: That ain't
even fucking right.
CHARD: What the fuck?
- That's what I'm saying.
TREVOR: You sure?
CHARD: It was some goat,
and it was...
He's going out there,
like...
That ain't right.
CHARD: Hey, man, I'll bet you
as soon as we started bombing,
these rich fucking hajis
got a plane ticket,
moved to fucking Albany,
bought a taxicab.
TINO: You are the biggest
racist in the world,
by the way.
Seriously, you are
a racist motherfucker,
'cause the same way
you talk about hajis
is the same way
you talk about black,
Mexican and everything else.
Now, do me a fucking favor
and send your racist ass over
'cause I got to go on watch.
CHARD: You're the only one
that's got to get up.
You shut the
motherfucker off.
I'm already asleep.
TINO: You fucking
pieces of shit.
CHARD: Kill the light.
That a girl.
TINO: Hey, stroke me on
the way back over here.
CHARD: There you go.
Morning, sunshine.
Morning, Keller.
Good morning, Staff Sergeant.
Anybody else awake?
Not that I saw. You want
me to wake them up?
No, you get
your eye together.
Enjoy the morning.
I'll do it.
MARCUS: Wake the fuck up,
ladies!
Get your
panties from around
your goddamn ankles.
It's a beautiful morning.
Time to wage a motherfucking
war on terror, God damn it.
Davies, get your dick
out your hand, man.
Didn't your mama teach you
better than that? God damn.
MARCUS: So I'm sure
some of you have already
noticed something.
What are we supposed
to be here observing?
Anybody? Feel free.
The road?
- That's right.
Now do you see a road,
Keller?
No, I don't, Staff Sergeant.
Me fucking neither.
But we goddamn
well gonna find it
before I get on the OMNI
and tell them that we can't
find the fucking road
that we supposed to
be guarding in the
first fucking place.
JORGE:  We should
just build a fucking road.
What was that, Wardell?
- Roger that, Staff Sergeant!
Good.
That's what I like to hear.
Now, there is a town nearby,
and we gonna roll up
in that bitch, drop a load
and let our presence be felt.
Well, let's go, girls.
This is what you
signed up for.
Yeah, I guess
they saw us coming.
Yeah, well, we're
kind of hard to miss.
Wilcox.
- Sir?
Tell anybody who's
inside to come out.
Do it.
MARCUS: Spread out.
This one's fucking empty.
So what, you want to
take a break, Davies?
That's one of them.
Check them all.
Clear!
Clear!
This one's clear, too.
Smart haji motherfuckers
are hiding from us.
Where the fuck are they
gonna hide from us, man?
What, are they under the sand,
breathing through straws?
Could be. You don't
know their culture.
Yo, look what I found.
They ain't leaving
without this, right?
I wouldn't think so.
Not to mention half
these houses were
meant to be rolled up
and taken with you.
What in the hell
is that?
This is Islamic law.
They bury you up to your neck
and stone you to death.
He must have done something.
Let's get the fuck
out of here.
We'll just stay on
watch in sets of two.
Anderson, you and Wilcox
take first shift until 0100.
You know, it's probably
not the smartest thing to
stand outside like this.
Especially if
anybody's around.
Yeah.
Shit.
Hey, guys!
You playing? Man, get
that peanut butter shit
out of here, dawg.
We're not playing with that.
Come on, dawg.
Playing with no money?
JORGE: Hey, shut that, man.
What the hell?
So fucking sorry, Wardell.
We been swimming in
sand for the past hour.
Is there anything else
we can do for you?
JORGE: Yeah, how about
some water, dickhead.
All right, all right.
We just about got the
rest of it. Anything
that's not packed away
is pretty much encased
with sand by now, all right?
I fucking hate this place.
TINO: How many days
we have to stay here?
Yo! Wilcox, you dream
about dick again?
That's fucking gay.
Guys!
There's somebody in here.
Get in the kitchen now!
Holy shit.
MARCUS: Wilcox.
GREGORY: I don't know.
MARCUS: What's she saying?
I don't know.
It's not Dari.
Is it Pashto?
No. No, no, no.
There's like 30 different
languages in this country,
all different dialects.
I have no fucking clue
what she's saying.
That's great.
Search her.
CHARD: I volunteer,
Staff Sergeant.
Shut the fuck up!
Wilcox, you and Keller.
Oh, fuck.
All right, go. Fuck...
JEFF: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Sorry. I'm really sorry.
MARCUS: Lower your weapons.
Things are really starting
to look up around here.
MARCUS: Davies, cut that shit
out right fucking now.
Hull, you and Anderson keep
watch over her until 0400.
Where?
MARCUS: In here.
Just watch her.
It's sandy in here.
MARCUS: In here.
I don't give a fuck
if she's got to
piss in her robe.
She does not leave this room
until we know that nobody's
out there waiting on her.
Sir, do you want
us to feed her?
Give her food or something,
Staff Sergeant?
MARCUS: Yeah, do that.
Everybody else, be on alert.
Keep your weapons nearby
if you go to sleep.
I can't understand
a word you're saying,
so don't waste your breath.
Or you could just
keep talking. Whichever.
You think she's got any more
of her homies outside?
The storm's quieting down now,
so I guess if there are,
we'll find out in a bit.
TINO: Yeah.
TREVOR: I just don't
understand where
she came from.
I mean, was she just
walking outside somewhere
and got caught up
in the storm?
TINO: Fuck if I know.
All right,
I just need to say this,
'cause somebody's got to.
You all know we could
just fuck her, right?
We could just take
her a ways in the desert.
Nobody has to know.
We could take turns.
I don't even gotta go first.
Trevor could go first.
Who's she gonna
fucking tell about it?
Come on, how long has it
been since either one of you
motherfuckers has gotten laid?
Apparently
not as long as you.
CHARD: Jeff?
No.
Well, yes, sir,
Mr. President.
Mr. "Faithful to
his girlfriend 10,000
fucking miles away from here."
You all are pussies, man.
Yeah, I'm a pussy
who's about to kick
the shit out of you
if you don't
shut the fuck up.
Well, gee.
It's a tense atmosphere.
CHARD: I got one.
I spy with my little eye,
something that's yellow.
JEFF: Is it sand?
CHARD: Yep.
JEFF: Hey. What's going on?
Keller, come here.
I want you to hear something.
Now, I'm supposed to
call Parker at 0800.
And I did.
His number's here.
They let you know
that you're connected.
So? What?
Listen.
You hear that?
I heard a voice.
Didn't sound like anybody
from Charlie. At least
I didn't recognize it.
It sounded like
a distress call.
I mean, is there
another platoon out there?
Fuck if I know.
It could be coming
from Kabul.
Anyway, I never
heard a distress signal.
I'm gonna stay here
and try to contact Parker.
See if I can't find
something more specific.
All units radio check.
All units radio check.
Radio check.
All units radio check. Over.
...66, 67, 68.
Come on, come on,
come on. That's weak, man.
TINO: That's weak, man,
come on.
Where you been?
All right, listen up.
We can't let her
wander around unsupervised.
Somebody's gotta watch her.
JORGE: Why? What the
hell's she gonna do?
Do you remember Matt Carson?
Yeah. Of course I do. Why?
I saw him.
You know he's dead,
Gregory.
Yeah. Yeah,
he looked pretty dead.
It's cool, man.
I get bad dreams sometimes.
No, I was awake.
I was wide awake
and I saw him.
Hey,
do I look like
a psychologist to you?
You're having issues or
what have you, you take
that shit to Staff Sergeant.
He'll get you to someone.
Fuck.
It's time for your shift.
You and Hull.
He's out there already, okay?
Fuck. Yeah, okay.
Yeah, that's fine.
What?
Huh?
You just told me to
get out of here, in Dari.
Well, I might have...
I must have heard
that phrase somewhere.
You should be careful
about saying things
you don't understand.
You could say something rude.
JEFF: Who the hell knew
it was so cold in Afghanistan?
It was like 110 degrees today.
I'm from Albany.
This place is a pleasure.
The cradle of civilization.
If you're in such
a hurry to get back,
why'd you sign up?
Well, a stint in the
military helps with
the field I'm going in.
What, you want to be,
like, president someday?
I don't know. My dad's
a state representative
back in Madison,
and I grew up with all
this stuff in my head, so...
Shit. Beats my plans.
Hell, I'd vote for you.
Yeah?
You registered to
vote back in Albany?
No.
Who the fuck is over there?
I don't fucking know.
I don't fucking know.
Who the fuck is
shooting at us?
I don't fucking know!
SOLDIER 1: It's us!
Stop firing at us!
SOLDIER 2: Cease fire!
SOLDIER 1: We're hit!
Cease fire!
We need a medic now,
a goddamned fucking medic!
Medic!
SOLDIER 1: Fuck!
JEFF: God, I can't believe
I fell asleep.
TINO: Big deal.
I was going to wake
you in a few minutes.
Our shift's almost up.
I'm gonna go grab
Wardell and Davies.
Yeah, okay.
Hey, what's up?
Did you wake them up?
No. Not yet.
Okay, I'll do it then.
This is Otus 3 Papa,
Otus 3 Papa. Do you copy?
Do you copy?
Say again, please?
Please identify yourself.
Roger that.
Roger that.
Identify yourself.
This is Otus 3 Papa.
Note that our
OMNI may be 404.
Please identify yourself.
Shut the fuck up!
Get the fuck off of me!
Howston, after the girl.
She's going for something.
Stop! Do not move!
MARCUS: Halt!
So, Davies and Wardell
say they didn't hear
anything on watch,
which leaves you two.
I assume you would
have woken us up had
you heard anything.
JEFF: What do you mean?
MARCUS: What I mean is this.
The ignition system,
it's been completely torn out.
We're screwed.
TINO: Fuck.
- That's right, guys.
Fuck, as in we are fucked.
Can we fix it?
That seems to be
a negative at the moment.
But I contacted Charlie
and was able to apprise
them of our situation.
GREGORY: Wait,
the SatCom's working?
Correct. I received
a communication this morning.
And, according to Parker,
some vehicles went by us
last night.
They intercepted them
on their end.
But they seem to have gone
right by us, so you know
what that means?
Ali Baba drove
right the fuck by,
ass-fucked us, and we
slept right through it,
despite having two people
on watch all night.
Are you saying that
cars drove by us and
we didn't even notice?
MARCUS: That's right.
- Staff Sergeant,
don't you think it's likely
we're just in
the wrong place?
We are not in
the wrong place.
We are exactly where
we're supposed to be,
which is where they left us.
So from now on, one person
is outside at all times.
You will walk out
as far as you can,
in three separate directions
keeping the house
in your sights.
You want us to stand out
in the desert all day?
You can't ask us to do that.
I'm not asking you
to do a goddamn thing,
Anderson. I'm telling you.
It's a direct fucking order,
and you will carry it out.
Now move!
Move!
Tino.
Tino.
You know, this is
bullshit, right?
Marcus is fucking
losing it, man.
Must be some delayed
PTSD or some shit.
Yeah. About the truck.
Yeah?
Whoever did that
has got to be somewhere nearby
to know we're here, right?
Maybe they're hiding
somewhere in the desert,
and here we are,
separated into teams.
Somebody could be
watching us,
and we wouldn't even
fucking know it.
Man, I'm telling you,
it had to be that
girl who was here.
All right, you telling me
she busted into our
Humvee ignition system?
Come on, man. Al-Qaeda's
got training camps all
over this sandbox, right?
The girl, huh?
Yeah, brother.
Well, we'll see about that.
Hey. Where's Wilcox?
Hey, can we go
back inside, please?
CHARD: Gregory just lost
his glasses or some shit.
MARCUS: It's gonna
be dark soon.
We're not going back inside
until we find our translator.
MARCUS: Hull!
Wilcox!
CHARD: Gregory!
MARCUS: Stay together.
CHARD: Hey, hey, up ahead.
Fucking shit.
Sarge, look at his face.
What happened to his eyes?
Jesus.
Look what they did to him.
Staff Sergeant?
You might want to
shut that light off.
MARCUS:  Jesus.
Secure her.
All right.
Want to go check on
the staff sergeant?
Check the other rooms.
Make sure we're alone.
Jorge, Chard,
keep an eye on her.
Hey! Hey!
- What the fuck
are you doing
sneaking up on me
in the dark?
I'm just...
Hey. I was just wondering
if you reached anybody.
What makes you think
I reached somebody?
I don't know.
I was just wondering.
Well, I haven't.
When I do, I'll let you know.
Hey, Staff Sergeant.
Do you think we should try
to rejoin our company?
No. We wait.
We have a job to do here,
and we gonna see it through.
I'm gonna go check out.
TREVOR: What the fuck, Hull?
What are you doing?
Where is he?
What are you doing, Hull?
Chard!
Put your weapon down, Hull.
TINO: Where's Jorge?
- Put your gun the fuck down!
Jorge, where is he?
CHARD: Put the gun
the fuck down.
Jorge killed Wilcox.
He's not what
you think he is.
TINO: He killed Wilcox.
Hey, calm down, Tino.
Jorge was with me all day.
Come on, man. He's telling
you the truth, man, all right?
CHARD: Just talk to me.
Tell me what you saw
out there, all right?
JORGE: Think this through,
all right, man?
Just think it through.
Hey!
MARCUS: What happened?
What the fuck happened?
Tino shot Jorge,
so I shot Tino.
Tino said Jorge
killed Wilcox.
Did Wardell leave your sight
at any time today?
No, swear to God.
Davies, two of my men
are fucking dead.
You think real hard
about your answer.
No.
Let's get their
bodies outside.
Now.
Right now.
TREVOR: Should we just
leave them out here?
MARCUS: What do you
want to do, bury them?
We can't bury them.
We got to get them home
to their families.
You take her
in the room with you
when you go to sleep.
She doesn't leave our sight
from now on. Understand?
I said, got it?
JEFF: Yes, Staff Sergeant.
I got it.
Asshole.
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm cool.
Keep an eye on her,
all right?
Sure thing.
CHARD: Jeff! Fucking Trevor.
Get out here!
Trev.
CHARD: Hey!
TREVOR: Shit.
Could, like, animals have
gotten them or something?
JEFF: No, and
there's no tracks.
TREVOR: This shit ain't right.
Where is she?
MARCUS: Hey.
JEFF: She was asleep.
She's not doing anything.
What's the big deal?
I gave you one goddamn order,
do not leave her alone.
What the fuck do you do?
Outside, both of you.
Get your gear.
What the fuck you
looking at him for?
MARCUS: Davies.
Get inside and
look after the girl.
Hey, I'm just trying
to find what happened...
Later. Inside. Now.
Sit down.
Now,
I'll sit out here
where I can
keep an eye on you.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about our
goddamn mission, Keller,
which is to sit outside
this house and look out
for the enemy,
and that's exactly
what we're going to do.
The three of us right here
where I can see you
and nobody else
can sneak up on us.
Okay.
Anderson,
that's the last time you
say anything other than,
"Yes, Staff Sergeant" to me.
Staff Sergeant,
you've proven your point.
Whatever it is.
Can we please go inside
and get some water?
In a minute. We'll all
get water together.
Come on, Keller.
This heat ain't shit.
I know you ain't no punk.
MARCUS: Fucking
milk-wean recruits
complaining about the heat.
I thought this shit
was basic training.
He's fucking insane.
It's a miracle you got
through boot camp, boys.
No shit.
What the fuck do you
want us to do about it?
What's the penalty for mutiny?
You got to earn that
uniform you got on.
You in the goddamn Army.
I don't know.
It's pretty bad.
What did you just say?
I'd asked Jeff... I...
You asked him what,
motherfucker? What the
fuck did you just say?
I was asking Jeff
if he knew how the
Vikings was doing
'cause they were
supposed to play
against St. Louis...
Shut the fuck up.
- Yeah.
I know what you're doing.
I know what you're doing.
You and him.
That motherfucking
redneck inbred cunt.
No! No! No!
What the fuck
did I tell you?
- Hey! Hey!
What the fuck did I say?
- Hey! Hey!
Hey, Marcus. She wanted to.
She wanted me to.
I'm sick of your
fucking shit, Davies.
You're a goddamn disgrace!
What the fuck did I say?
CHARD: Hey!
She wanted me to,
you fucking nigger!
What'd you call me?
What'd you call me?
Hey, I called you nimrod.
Look, I say,
"You fucking nimrod."
Nimrod.
Don't call me a nimrod.
I went to college,
motherfucker.
You don't
fucking push me around.
You don't fucking
push me around.
You fucking big man.
- Hey!
Come on, motherfucker.
Get the fuck off me.
- Chard, come on, man.
Think you can fucking
push me around?
You killed me,
Staff Sergeant.
Right in the fucking chest.
What the fuck are
you all staring at?
Dead bodies go outside.
It's okay. Everything's
gonna be all right.
Everything's all right?
Are you fucking kidding me?
She doesn't understand
a damn word that's
coming out of my mouth.
What the fuck are we gonna do?
Take him outside.
Then what?
How the fuck are we
getting out of here?
Where is he?
I don't know.
Fuck this, man. It's over.
You saw this shit.
We need to take him down now.
Staff Sergeant!
TREVOR: Here. You're better
with this thing than me.
Okay. Who should
I try to reach?
Are you kidding?
Fucking anybody.
I don't care if you
dial up the Taliban
at this point.
All right.
This is Otus 3 Papa.
I repeat, Otus 3 Papa.
We are 5-38.
Please acknowledge.
Please acknowledge.
Just anyone please respond.
Say again?
Did you get somebody?
I heard something.
This is Otus 3 Papa.
Do you copy?
I don't hear anything.
I'll just keep trying
for a little while.
Do you read me? Please copy.
If you can hear me,
we are 5-38.
- Say again, 5-38.
This is Otus 3 Papa.
We're stranded out here.
Our staff sergeant
has gone AWOL,
and our transportation
is Tango Uniform.
Please advise.
We don't know what to do.
What?
What?
Nothing.
Uh...
Nothing.
Shit. The girl.
Where's the girl?
I don't know.
Stay here and keep trying.
I'll go find her.
JEFF: Fuck. What the fuck?
MARCUS: Think I don't know
what you are?
I know, motherfucker.
Hey, Trevor!
Yeah. I'm outside. Stay down.
No more lights. You got it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I fucking got it.
Who the hell is
shooting at us?
It's Marcus.
Look, get my weapon.
I need my scope.
Trevor?
- I'm over here.
Over where, man.
- I can't see a damn thing.
By the wall.
JEFF: Where?
Over here.
Shit!
Jeff, you hit?
No.
What happened?
JEFF: Uh...
Trevor, there's something
else out here, man.
Get the fuck over here.
- I can't see anything.
Did you see where the shots
were coming from?
No, man. No.
I thought I did,
but he probably dug
himself some cover.
Crazy motherfucker. Look,
let's move back to the house.
He's probably got goggles,
so stay low.
All right.
He'll see us if
we move from here.
Trev, listen, man.
There... There is
something else out there.
Go get me an illume round.
I'll keep watch.
All right. I saw
the woman in the back.
Yeah.
What the fuck is
she doing back there?
I don't know.
But I'm gonna go get her.
Be careful.
She could be trying
to signal somebody.
Yeah, right.
Wilcox?
Anderson. Don't shoot, man.
Do you have a weapon?
Show me your hands.
I don't have a gun.
Keep your hands up.
Okay.
Gregory,
you're dead, man.
I saw your corpse.
Yeah.
Just two of you
motherfuckers left now.
Real fucking clever.
JEFF: Hands up!
Put your hands on your head.
Down.
Get the fuck down.
All right. I'm not
sure what's going on,
but I'm gonna
tie you up again
and then I'm gonna...
SOLDIER:
What's up, soldier?
Specialist Keller,
I understand
you were less than
fully forthcoming
during your debriefing.
Let's see if we can't
refresh your memory.
I'm going to lay out
our version of the facts
and you tell me if I'm getting
it right or wrong. Got that?
Okay.
Your squad was
stationed on a patrol
during which time
your communications
systems went down.
Shortly thereafter, you
were attacked by a group
of al-Qaeda fighters,
about 30 of them.
More? 40?
What the hell, let's say 50.
So, this faction of 50
or so al-Qaeda militants
easily outnumbered your squad.
Your staff sergeant
was killed,
as were all the other
members of your squad.
But you somehow survived by...
I was knocked unconscious.
You were knocked unconscious.
Yes.
Knocked unconscious
and left for dead.
A hero, really.
Now, under the circumstances,
I think we can
take care of you.
All right, you sit tight.
I'll get Hollister in here
to take care of the paperwork,
and all that's left is
to get you on a plane.
With any luck, you'll
be on American soil
day after tomorrow.
