This is Richard Valeriani
reporting live...
for CNN from the French
aircraft carrier Foch...
somewhere in the Mediterranean.
Six days ago,
as the rebellion in Chechnya...
spread to the neighboring Caucasus
republics, the Russian president...
ordered massive bombing strikes
against rebel positions...
around Rutul and Belokany.
Appalled at the loss of human life,
the President of the United States...
joined by the French president
and the British prime minister...
suspended all foreign aid
to Russia.
Ultranationalist leader
Vladimir Radchenko...
denounced the U.S. Pressure
as an act of war...
against the Russian Republic
and Russian sovereignty.
Denouncing his own president
as a U.S. Puppet...
he called on the Russian people
to join him in revolt.
He said, "This brutish and hypocritical
American intervention...
will not go unanswered."
On Tuesday, at 10:00
in the morning Moscow time...
the Russian parliament was suspended
and martial law was declared.
With the government in crisis,
the Russian Republic...
was entering into what can only
be described as a state of civil war.
Then yesterday at dawn,
Radchenko and rebel forces...
seized the region around Vladivostok,
including a naval base...
and a nuclear missile base
housing Russian ICBMs.
As regular Russian military forces
move in to encircle Radchenko...
allied military forces
are in a state of high alert.
These French planes
taking off behind me...
have been deployed near the Caucasus
since the beginning of the crisis...
and a crisis which started
in the Caucasus
has now spread to the Far East...
and appears to be turning into the worst
standoff since the Cuban missile crisis.
This is Richard Valeriani
reporting live for CNN...
from the French aircraft carrier Foch,
somewhere in the Mediterranean.
Abracadabra!
- I can't hear you.
-  Abracadabra!
I need a volunteer
from the audience.
-  Me! Me!
- Me, me, me!
A brave volunteer.
Me! Me! Me!
Preferably...
Preferably somebody who was born
on October 18...
nineteen hundred and ninety.
That's you, honey. That's you.
Over here? Over here?
Ahh! You must be the birthday girl.
- What's your name?
- Robin.
Russian ultranationalist leader,
backed by his rebel army...
threatened nuclear attack
on the United States and Japan.
The threats come as a response
to U.S. Involvement in Chechnya...
and are not considered idle.
Now sit on the board.
And tell me, Robin,
do you believe in magic?
- Where'd he go?
- Good. Because if you believe...
- I'll get him.
- We can suspend you in the air...
- Be right back.
- Without the help of a flying carpet.
Meeting in an emergency session...
You'll miss your daughter's levitation.
While the President is sequestered
with his joint chiefs of staff.
That footage was taken yesterday,
but half an hour ago...
surrounded by hostile forces,
rebel leader Vladimir Radchenko...
Maybe it's not as bad as it looks.
-
- Threatened to use nuclear arms
on the United States and Japan...
should anyone, including the Russian
Army, attempt to move in on him.
- Based on the history of this man...
-
- This can't be viewed as an idle threat.
-
- Sander Vanocur standing by...
- It is.
Commander Hunter.
-
- Annapolis.
Five patrols on fast attacks.
Two on boomers;
one as X.O.
-
- Hmm.
A year at...
Excuse me. Harvard?
I talked to your former C.O.
He tells me he tried to adopt you.
As you no doubt heard,
my X.O. Has appendicitis.
He's the best
I ever had.
I need a good man
to fill his spot.
Your name was
at the top of the list.
Well, that's good to know, sir.
It was a short list.
Your interests, Mr. Hunter.
What do you like to do? Do you, uh...
Do you paint, play ball, play
an instrument, ride motorcycles, what?
- I ride horses.
- Horses.
What's the best horse
you ever rode?
- Arabian, sir.
- An Arabian? That's a powerful animal.
- Yes.
-
- You ever ridden one?
- Me? Are you kidding?
Nah, I couldn't handle an Arabian.
Nah, just give me an old paint.
Yeah, horses are
fascinating animals.
Dumb as fence posts
but very intuitive.
In that way, they're not too different
from high school girls.
They might not have
a brain in their head...
but they do know
all the boys want to fuck 'em.
Don't have to be able to read Ulysses
to know where they're comin' from.
- No, sir.
-
He approves of you.
Jack Russells.
Smartest dogs alive.
Name's Bear.
Goes everyplace with me.
Well, welcome aboard
the Alabama, son.
- Do me proud.
- I will, sir.
- Congratulations, Mr. Hunter.
- Thank you.
If one Russian citizen
is killed...
and I am president...
then I will kill 900,000 of the people
who are responsible.
- You'd use nuclear weapons?
- Yes, I would hit them...
- Attention!
With nuclear weapons.
- At ease. Be seated.
-  Sir, such talk
is highly inflammatory.
My dear young lady,
I do not engage in "talk."
These are serious threats, which I hope
to be in the position to carry out.
I take it you've seen enough?
Gentlemen, after a nice little vacation,
looks like we're back at it again.
I hope you enjoyed the peace, because
as of now, we're back in business.
In the good old days of Cold War, the
Russians could always be depended on...
doing whatever is in
their own best interests.
But this Radchenko's playing a whole new
ball game with a whole new set of rules.
Now I've heard people talk...
but I don't think this man's talking
to get his picture in the paper.
He seems to have a serious weed
up his ass and a legitimate gripe.
Always a dangerous combination.
And I think he's capable...
of doing every damn thing
he says he's going to do.
That's why we have to go out there
and give the man a moment of pause.
So ends theory.
Thus, let us begin the facts.
We've been informed by the NSA...
that an entire rebel corps
of the Russian Army is involved.
That's four armored divisions
numbering 60,000 men.
There seems to be
massive defections.
Vladimir seems to be winning the hearts
and minds of the Russian soldiers.
- Admiral.
- Thank you.
They've seized the region by the Chinese
and North Korean borders.
That includes a submarine base...
from which they've surged
four Akula-class attack subs.
They have acquired
a nuclear base at Artem...
that houses 25 hardened silos
for Russian ICBMs...
armed with up to
ten warheads apiece.
Now the Russian government has
assured us that talks are underway.
They claim that Radchenko forces
do not possess the launch codes.
But if Radchenko
were to crack them...
they could launch against
our west coast direct...
or come in over the Pole,
take out Washington and New York.
The Commander-in-Chief...
has directed U.S. Military forces...
to set DEFCON four.
We've been ordered
to get underway at 0600 hours...
to assume alert coverage, mid-Pacific,
the Far Eastern TVD target package.
Please keep your men informed.
Lieutenant Commander Hunter
is our new X.O.
Please bring him up to speed on
ship's personnel and supplies. Admiral?
- No, that's it.
- On your feet.
-
-
- Here we go again, Commander.
- Thank you.
You bet. Hey, Bobby.
This is Bobby Dougherty. He's Supplies.
- Pleasure, Dougherty.
- Billy Linkletter, TSO.
- Mr. Linkletter.
- Commander.
- And you know Darik.
- Yes. Westergaurd. Long time no see.
- How's Julia?
- She's excellent.
- Good.
- And Roy Zimmer, Communications.
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.
- We served together on the Baton Rouge.
- Twice.
- That's right. We're lucky to have him.
- I think his dog gave me
the final seal of approval.
- He's crazy about that dog.
Takes him everywhere. The Navy looks
the other way 'cause he's Ramsey.
Navy looks the other way
'cause he's one of the few skippers
left who've seen combat.
- He took SEALS into Panama in '89.
- Tomahawks in the Gulf in '91.
- Took out eight or nine X.O. S in '94?
- Ouch.
- Last one caught what? Appendicitis?
- Yeah, right.
- The Enemy Below.
- Robert Mitchum.
- And?
- And what?
- Robert Mitchum.
- Incomplete answer.
- The German guy with the white hair?
- Yeah. What's his name?
- Who was it?
- Curt Jurgens.
Hardy Kruger.
No way.
- Robert Shaw in his Nazi period.
-
Question is invalid.
We're even.
- Whoo.
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine. Thanks.
- Good. Address me as "sir"
when you speak to me!
Stand at attention, sailor!
Is he gonna fit in the sub?
Doubtful.
Who played the German sub commander
in The Enemy Below with Robert Mitchum?
- Was it Curt Jurgens or Hardy Kruger?
- Sir...
Wrong answer!
Drop down and give me 20! Now!
- Move! Move!
- One.  Two.
- Run Silent, Run Deep.
-  Three.
The guy with the ears
and a little moustache.
- Cary Grant.
-
I'm worried about "T."
- Why?
- She doesn't know what's goin' on.
I think she thinks
I'm goin' away forever.
- I'll take care of her.
- You will?
- Yeah.
- You promise?
I promise.
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, son.
Okay.
You know
I don't know what to say.
Just say good-bye.
See you in my dreams.
Give me a kiss.
- Davis.
- How you doin', sir?
Crew present and
accounted for, sir.
Little ducks...
there's trouble
in Russia.
So they called us.
We're going over there
and bringing...
the most lethal killing machine
ever devised.
We're capable...
of launching
more firepower...
than has ever been released
in the history of war.
For one purpose alone:
To keep our country safe.
We constitute the front line...
and the last line of defense.
I expect and demand...
your very best.
Anything less, you should have
joined the Air Force.
This might be our
Commander-in-Chief's Navy...
but this is my boat.
And all I ask is that
you keep up with me.
And if you can't...
that strange sensation you'll be feeling
in the seat of your pants...
will be my boot in your ass.
- Mr. Cob?
- Yes, sir!
You're aware of the name of this ship,
aren't you, Mr. Cob?
Very aware, sir!
It bears a proud name,
doesn't it, Mr. Cob?
Very proud, sir!
- It represents fine people.
- Very fine people, sir!
- Who live in a fine, outstanding state.
-  Outstanding, sir!
In the greatest country
in the entire world.
In the entire world, sir.
- And what is that name, Mr. Cob?
- Alabama, sir!
- And what do we say?
-  Go, 'Bama!
Roll tide!
Chief of the boat,
dismiss the crew.
Dismiss the crew.
Aye, aye, sir.
Crew! Department heads!
Attend to your departments!
- Fall out!
-
Here. Part of your qualification
for command.
The last breath of polluted air
for the next 65 days.
Gonna miss it.
I don't trust air I can't see.
This is my favorite part.
Right here, right now.
Bravo, Hunter.
Sir?
You knew to shut up
and enjoy the view.
Most eggheads want
to talk it away.
Your stock just went up
a couple of points.
Thank you, sir.
Allow me to give you
a tiny bit of advice.
If you want
your own boat someday...
the very worst thing you can do is worry
about yourself or try to impress me.
I can't stand save-asses,
and I won't abide kiss-asses.
You keep your priorities straight:
Your mission and your men.
How you like that cigar?
- It's good, sir.
- It's your first.
Yeah.
Don't like it too much.
They're more expensive than drugs.
X.O., take her down.
Take her down.
Aye, sir.
Control/Bridge:
Sounding.
Bridge/Control:
Sounding 130 fathoms.
- Lookouts, clear the bridge.
- Clear the bridge. Aye, sir.
Officer of the deck,
prepare to dive.
- Captain down.
- Captain is down.
- X.O. Down.
- X.O. Is down.
- Submerge the ship.
- Diving Officer, submerge the ship.
- Make your depth 150 feet.
- Make my depth 150 feet. Aye, sir.
Chief of the watch,
on the 1MC, dive, dive!
Make your depth 150 feet.
Five degree down bubble.
-  I don't understand.
-  You don't understand?
Radchenko is a fanatic, okay?
He's a potential Hitler.
- Somebody should just shoot him.
- I have no problem with that.
- Good.
- Well, it's fanatics who make history.
- Colonel Patton was a fanatic.
- That's what made him great.
You think this guy is Patton?
He's a dangerous lunatic, threatening
nuclear war, and he means it.
What's that make us, since we're the
only nation to ever drop a nuclear bomb?
It makes us a prime target.
There's a half a dozen...
other Third World countries with
atom bombs who'd love to drop one on us.
That's right.
That's why we should drop one on them.
Are you a communist? You have a problem
with us dropping nuclear bombs on Japan?
- Shut up, Dougherty.
- You think it was a mistake, Mr. Hunter?
Sir?
Using the bomb
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
- Well, if I thought that,
sir, I wouldn't be here.
-
- Interesting way you put that.
- How'd I put it, sir?
Very carefully.
You do qualify your remarks.
Somebody asked me if we
should have bombed Japan...
a simple, "Yes, by all means, sir.
Drop that fucker. Twice."
-
- I don't mean to suggest...
that you're indecisive,
Mr. Hunter.
Not at all.
Just, um... complicated.
Of course, that's the way
the Navy wants you.
Me, they wanted simple.
- Well, you certainly fooled them, sir.
-
Be careful there, Mr. Hunter.
It's all I got to rely on:
Bein' a simpleminded son of a bitch.
Rickhover gave me
my command...
a checklist, a target
and a button to push.
All I had to know
is how to push it.
They'd tell me when.
They seem to want you to know why.
I would hope they'd want
us all to know why, sir.
At the Naval War College...
it was metallurgy and nuclear reactors,
not 19th-century philosophy.
"War is a continuation
of politics by other means."
Von Clausewitz.
I think, sir, that what he was actually
trying to say was a little more...
- Complicated?
-
Yes, the purpose of war is
to serve a political end...
but the true nature of war
is to serve itself.
I'm very impressed.
In other words, the sailor
most likely to win the war...
is the one most willing to part
company with the politicians...
and ignore everything except
the destruction of the enemy.
You'd agree with that.
I'd agree that, uh, that's what
Clausewitz was trying to say.
But you wouldn't agree with it?
No, sir, I do not. No, I just think
that in the nuclear world...
the true enemy
can't be destroyed.
Attention on deck.
Von Clausewitz will now tell us
exactly who the real enemy is.
-
- Von?
In my humble opinion,
in the nuclear world...
the true enemy
is war itself.
Everywhere I go your face I see
Every step I take
- You take with me
-
Nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run, baby
Nowhere to hide
I know you're no good for me
But free of you
I'll never be, baby
Move!
Fire in the galley! Chief of the watch,
sound the general alarm!
Forward damage control, bring
additional fire extinguishers to the...
-
- Fire's out of control. He's hurtin'.
- You hit the kill switch?
- Couldn't get to it. Too hot.
Attention, all hands.
Fire has been contained.
Damage control party,
assess damage and report to Control.
- Initiate weapons system readiness test.
- Aye, sir.
All right, station a reflash watch.
This thing could flare back up again.
Conn/Radio: We are receiving
flash traffic emergency action message.
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one.
Alert one. Man battle stations missile
for weapons systems readiness test.
- Spin up all missiles.
- What the hell is he runnin'
a missile drill now for?
- You're in charge.
- Aye, sir.
Man battle stations missiles
for weapons system readiness test.
Spin up all missiles.
This is an exercise.
-
- Captain's in Control.
I agree.
The message is properly formatted.
Sir, we have a properly formatted
emergency action message...
for weapons system
readiness test, sir.
- I concur, sir.
- Where's the X.O.?
- Sir.
- Good of you to make it, Mr. Hunter.
Get the authenticator.
Get the authenticator.
Let's go.
Sir, request permission
to authenticate.
Permission granted.
Authenticate.
"Alpha, Alpha, Bravo,
Echo, Charlie, Zulu, Tango."
"Alpha, Alpha, Bravo, Echo,
Charlie, Zulu, Tango."
- Captain, message is authentic.
- I concur, sir.
- I agree.
- Message is authentic.
Sir, your captain's
missile key.
Set condition 1Sq for WSRT. This is
the captain. This is an exercise.
Set condition 1Sq for WSRT.
This is the X.O. This is an exercise.
Captain, that fire in the galley
could still flare...
Now is not the time.
Make your depth 150 feet. All stop.
Make my depth 150 feet.
All stop. Aye, sir.
Weapons/Conn:
Simulate pressurizing, all tubes.
Weapons/Conn:
Simulate pressurizing, all tubes.
Conn/Weapons: Simulate pressurizing,
all missiles. Aye, aye, sir.
Simulate pressurizing,
all missiles.
Simulate pressurizing,
all missiles. Aye.
All stations, proceed to 1Sq.
Ready all missiles for launch.
Come on, guys. Let's go!
Weapons/Captain:
Report approximate time
for 1Sq.
Captain/Weapons: Approximate time
to weapons system 1Sq:
Fourteen minutes, sir.
Ship is at launch depth.
Ready to hover, sir.
- Very well. Commence hovering.
- Commence hovering. Aye, sir.
Control/Sick Bay: Chief Petty Officer
Marichek is undergoing cardiac arrest.
- We're beginning CPR.
- Chief of the watch, on the 1MC.
Gentlemen, may I have
your attention, please?
We've received word that a shipmate
is experiencing a medical problem.
We're terminating the drill. Mr.
Mahoney, take the conn. I'm going below.
- X.O.
-  Aye, sir. I have the conn.
Clear.
Clear.
It's okay, Chief.
Thank you, sir.
Sorry, sir.
Hiya, boy.
Hiya, hiya, hiya.
How ya doin'?
Oh, boy. Yeah.
So, Mr. Hunter, do you think
I was wrong to run that drill?
Not necessarily, sir.
- Do you think I got that man killed?
- No, sir.
One thing had nothing to do
with the other. It was an accident.
- Would you have run the drill?
- No, sir, I wouldn't have.
Why not?
The fire in the galley
could have flared back up.
- I would have seen to it first, sir.
- I'm sure you would have.
Me, on the other hand, I tend to think
that's the best time to run a drill.
Confusion on the ship
is nothing to fear.
It should be taken advantage of.
Lest you forget, Mr. Hunter, we are
a ship of war, designed for battle.
You don't just fight battles
when everything is hunky-dory.
What'd you think, son? I was just
some crazy old coot putting everyone...
in harm's way
as I yell "yee-haw"?
That was not
my first thought, sir.
But there's no excuse. At the time
I was fighting the fire in the galley...
I did not agree
with your call, sir.
Take a seat.
Just so we understand
each other...
I don't have any problems
with questions or doubts.
As I said to you before, I'm not
seeking the company of kiss-asses.
When you got somethin' to say to me,
you say it in private.
And if privacy doesn't permit itself,
then you bite your fucking tongue.
- Are we clear about that, Commander?
- As a bell, sir.
Those sailors out there
are just boys...
boys who are training to do
a terrible and unthinkable thing,
and if that ever occurs...
the only reassurance they'll have
that they're doing the proper thing...
is gonna derive from their unqualified
belief in the unified chain of command.
That means we don't question each
other's motives in front of the crew.
It means we don't
undermine each other.
It means in a missile drill...
they hear your voice right after mine,
without hesitation.
- Do you agree with that policy, sailor?
- Absolutely, sir.
We're here to preserve democracy,
not to practice it.
There'll be a memorial service in
the enlisted men's mess at 1100 hours.
- Go see to it.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Oh, Hunter.
Short of the outbreak
of World War III...
the ship sinking or being
attacked by a giant octopus...
I'd like to be undisturbed
for the next 30 minutes.
I'll see to it, sir.
By the way, it was Marichek's
Not the fire.
Dismissed.
One, two, three, four.
Back. Back.
One, two. One, two.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Does it make any sense to you to start
a drill in the middle of a fire?
- Fire was out, wasn't it?
- Yeah, and a man died too.
- Not 'cause of what the captain did.
- What?
Not 'cause of what
the captain did.
Weps...
a fire is a serious threat
to the ship.
- Now where was he? Why didn't
he check it out first, huh?
- That's his style.
- He's a hard-ass.
- So what?
So you wanna fight him,
go ahead.
You wanna get along, you gotta get
to understand him a little bit.
Two schools of thought here.
To him, you're Annapolis...
Harvard, expert on theory,
well-versed in world affairs.
Ha!
He's had his head up his ass
drivin' ships for the last 25 years.
He's probably
a little paranoid about that.
I mean, Navy's all he's got.
Navy and that little rat-dog of his.
That's why his wife left him.
So what are you saying?
I'm just sayin' watch out.
Give him a little room.
Let him get to know you.
You do pants too?
Conn/Radio:
Receiving emergency action message.
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one!
Alert one! Alert one!
Incoming emergency action message!
Alert one! Alert one!
Incoming EAM.
Captain.
Captain has asked me to brief you...
on the emergency action message
we just received.
As you know,
before we got underway...
the Russian army was in position
and circling the rebel camps...
and Radchenko started making extravagant
threats should anyone move in on him...
that he would launch
his land-based nuclear weapons
at the United States and at Japan.
The only safeguard was that the Russian
government controlled the launch codes.
Intel now indicates that those
launch codes have been compromised.
U.S. Military forces have been
directed to set DEFCON three.
The last time we hit
this state of emergency...
was 32-and-a-half years ago
during the Cuban missile crisis.
So this is what it's all about,
gentlemen. It's what we train for.
Captain.
The NCA has determined that...
should our satellites detect
rebel missiles being fueled...
which means they could be
launched in just over one hour...
we'll be compelled to act.
Now given our patrol sector
here in the Emperor Sea Mounts...
it seems clear that our friends
in the Pentagon...
are setting us up for
a potential preemptive strike.
It's important
to remain focused.
Keep your men informed.
Any questions?
Dismissed.
- We lost that frying unit, and then...
-
- We can't get the same capacity in...
-
-
- Hey, man!
I'm gonna fuck you up!
Get out! Get...
Get out of here, man! Get him out!
Motherfucker!
- Fuckin' piece of shit.
- Bennefield, you crazy, man?
- Rivetti, what's up?
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It's just a difference of
opinion that got out of hand.
- What about?
It's really too silly to talk about,
sir. I'd rather just forget about...
I don't give a damn about
what you'd rather forget about.
Why were you two fighting?
I said that the Kirby Silver Surfer
was the only real Silver Surfer...
and that the Moebius Silver Surfer
was shit.
And Bennefield's
a big Moebius fan, and...
It just got out of hand.
I pushed him; he pushed me.
- I lost my head, sir. I'm sorry.
- Rivetti, you're a supervisor.
You can get a commission like that.
I know it, sir.
You're 100% right.
- It'll never happen again.
- It better not happen again.
I see this kind of nonsense,
I'm gonna write you up. You understand?
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
You have to set an example
even in the face of stupidity.
Everybody that reads comic books
knows that Kirby Silver Surfer
is the only true Silver Surfer.
- Now am I right or wrong?
-  You're right, sir.
- All right. Get out of here.
- Yes, sir.
- Captain.
- How can I help you?
Test results
from the missile drill.
This the best
they can do?
No, sir, but that's
what they did.
I want this down to five minutes.
Train on it.
Yes, sir.
Tell your buddy Weps
we're gonna do it again.
We're gonna keep on doin' it
until he gets it right.
Damn.
Feels like the whole crew
needs a kick in the ass.
Or a pat on the back, sir.
I just witnessed a fight down in
crew's mess. No big deal, but...
I think the men are a little on edge
with all we're going through.
- Morale seems to be a bit low.
-
Well, you seem to have
the pulse of the men.
Thank you, sir.
May I have your
attention, please?
Summer's here and
the time is right
- Mr. Hunter has informed me...
- For dancin' in the street
that morale may be a bit low...
that you may be a bit...
- On edge.
- On edge.
So I suggest this:
Any crew member who feels
he can't handle the situation...
can leave the ship right now.
Gentlemen, we're at DEFCON three.
War is imminent.
This is the captain.
That is all.
Very inspiring, sir.
Come on, Bear.
Come on. Come on.
Sup?
Come here.
You hear that?
I've got a broadband contact
bearing 047.
Assigning tracker sierra in ATF.
Conn/Sonar: We have a possible
submerged submarine bearing 047.
Designate contact: Master 28.
Sonar/Conn: Aye.
Man battle stations torpedo.
- Rig for ultraquiet.
- Make tubes one and four fully ready.

Aye, sir.

- Best depth for evasion, sir,
is 831 feet to avoid that sub.
Lieutenant Mahoney,
this is the captain.
Increase your speed to standard.
Come left to course 270.

- You find out who that is.
- Aye, sir.
- Who are you, sweetheart?
- Helm, all ahead standard.
Dive. Make your depth
Aye, sir.

- Spin up missiles 1 - 5 and 20 - 24.
The release of nuclear weapons
has been authorized.
This is not a drill.
X.O., take the conn. I'm going
to my stateroom for the launch keys.
X.O. Has the conn.
Set condition 1Sq

- Comin' through!
- Spin up missiles 1 - 5...
and 20 - 24.
- I have the conn.
- The captain has the conn.
Passing 550 feet.
Conn/Radio: Sir, we're out of VLF radio
range. Full message capacity is cut off.
Radio/Conn:
Extend extremely low frequency antenna.
Passing 600 feet.
Coming to 831 feet, sir.
Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.
Uh, Conn/Sonar: Uh, sir,
we have his classification.
Mark that tape.
Get the classification on your monitor.
- Rivetti, what the hell is going on?
- Sir, the master 28...
is classified as
a Russian Akula-class hunter-killer.
Bearing 196, sir! He's close,
but I don't think he's spotted us.
- Stay on him!
- Aye, sir.
- Captain has the conn.
-  Passing 800 feet, sir.
Continue to dive.
Give me five degree down bubble.
- Continue rigging for ultraquiet.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Five degree down bubble.
Rigging for ultraquiet, sir.
Gentlemen, this is the captain.
We have an Akula-class
submarine out there.
We know Radchenko controls at least four
submarines. This could be one of them.
Russian rebels have threatened
to launch against our country...
and are fueling right now.
They will have launch capability
in 60 minutes.
We have orders to launch our missiles,
which is exactly what we're going to do.
We are rigging for ultraquiet.
All hands, be ready.
This is as real as it gets.
We'll presume nothing,
defend ourselves at all cost.
If that sub even comes around or opens
up a tube door, we'll take her out.
Passing 900 feet.
- He's gone.
- Like hell he is.
He's up there.
Conn/Weapons: Missile systems
ready to launch in 11 minutes.
Conn/Radio: Receiving transmission on
extremely low frequency receiver, sir.
Very well.
Mr. Hunter, go to Radio, please.
- Okay, pull up the code. X.O.
- What do you got?
Incoming EAM, but we're too deep
to receive any radio communication, sir.
- Captain.
- X.O.
We got a limited radio transmission
indicating an incoming EAM.
We need to go shallow
to reestablish communications.
With that sub still up there?
Mr. Hunter, it's my inten...
- Come up to conn, Mr. Hunter.
- Yes, sir.
- Zero bubble.
- Zero bubble. Aye, sir.
Conn/Weapons: Missile systems
ready to launch in ten minutes.
- Sir.
-  Attention, all hands.
- Ship has been rigged for ultraquiet.
- Captain?
When our missile system
is ready, Mr. Hunter...
it is my intention
to rise to launch depth...
launch our birds
and then get the hell out of there.
Not until then.
I can't jeopardize
the safety of this ship.
Yes, sir.
May I suggest that we float
the buoy, sir? We have enough cable.
That should give us enough reach
to receive the EAM transmission.
Sir.
Very well.
Float the buoy.
Chief of the watch,
float the buoy.
Float the radio buoy.
Aye, sir.
Radio buoy deploying, sir.
Tension 2,000 pounds.
Very well.
Conn/Weapons: Estimated time to 1Sq:
-
- The winch!
- Conn/Sonar: We have a sound short
from the buoy winch!
- Stop the goddamn winch!
-
- Winch is stopped, sir!
Goddamn it.
TSO, is that sound
still out there?
- Sonar/TSO:
Is that sound still out there?
-
Sound's gone, sir.
-
- I'm getting something.
-
- Sup, he's comin' around!
Conn/Sonar: The Akula's

Sir, the first torpedo's going
after the countermeasures!
They missed!
They missed!
Sonar/Conn, Conn/Sonar: Second torpedo

Conn/Sonar: The Akula's
disappeared in the thermal, sir.
All ahead standard!
Rudder amid ships!
- All ahead standard.
Rudder amid ships. Aye.
- All stations.
All stations, report damage.
Report damage.

- Conn/Sonar: Uh, we lost him, sir.
- Well, keep looking.
- He's out there looking for us.
- Aye, sir.
Weapons/Conn:
Estimated time to 1Sq.
Conn/Weapons: Missile systems

-  Very well.
Main seawater pump
is out of commission.
Mr. Zimmer,
where's that EAM?
Mr. Zimmer,
where's that EAM?
- You all right, son?
- Yes, sir.
- That's it?
- Ah, uh-huh. It's incomplete, sir.
We lost it when the radio buoy cable
got severed.
All right.
All right, gentlemen,
let's get on with it.
All ahead one-third.
-
- Steady as you go.
All ahead one-third.
Steady. Aye, sir.
Make your depth 150 feet.
Zero bubble.
Up slow and silent
to launch depth.
Up slow and silent to launch depth.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Captain?
Got the EAM.
- What do you think?
- I think there's nothing on this.
Yes, sir. It, uh, got cut off
during the attack.
Then it's meaningless.
Sir, this is an EAM
pertaining to nuclear missiles.
No, Mr. Hunter,
that's a message fragment.
Because it got cut off
during the attack, sir.
The message could mean anything.
It could be a message to abort.
- It could be a message...
- Could be a fake Russian transmission.
Which is exactly why
we need to confirm it, sir.
- All I'm asking for is the time
we need to get back on line.
- Calm down, Mr. Hunter.
- I am calm.
- You don't appear to be calm.
Conn/Weapons: Missile systems
ready to launch in four minutes.
- Step aside, seaman.
- Yes, sir.
We have orders in hand, and those orders
are to make a preemptive launch.
Every second that we lose
increases the chances...
that by the time our missiles arrive,
their silos could be empty...
'cause they've flown their birds
and struck us first.
- Yes, sir.
- You know as well as I do...
that any launch order received without
authentication is no order at all.
- Captain... National Mili...
- That's our #1 rule.
That rule is the basis for the scenario
we've trained on time and time again.
- Yes, sir.
- It's a rule we follow
without exception.
Captain, National Military Command
Center knows what sector we're in.
They have satellites looking down on us
to see if our birds are aloft.
And if they're not, then they give
our orders to somebody else.
That's why we maintain more than one
sub. It's what they call "redundancy."
- I know about redundancy, Mr. Hunter.
- All I'm saying...
All I'm saying, Captain,
is that we have backup.
Now, it's our duty not to launch
until we can confirm.
You're presuming that we have other
submarines out there ready to launch.
But as captain,
I must assume...
that our submarines could have been
taken out by other Akulas.
We can play these games
all night, Mr. Hunter...
- but I don't have the luxury
of your presumptions.
- Sir...
Mr. Hunter, we have rules that are not
open to interpretation...
personal intuition, gut feelings,
hairs on the back of your neck...
little devils or angels
sitting on your shoulders.
- Captain...
- We're all very well aware...
of what our orders are
and what those orders mean.
They come down from
our Commander-in-Chief.
They contain no ambiguity.
- Captain, sir...
- Mr. Hunter, I've made the decision.
I'm captain of this boat.
Now shut the fuck up!
Damn.
Weapons/Conn:
Shift targeting
to target package SLBM 64741/2.
This is the captain.
- Captain, I cannot concur.
- Repeat my command.
Sir, we don't know what this means.
Our target package could have changed.
You repeat this order
or I'll find somebody who will!
- Hell no, you won't, sir.
- You're relieved of your position.
Cob, remove Mr. Hunter
from the control room.
- Get Lieutenant Zimmer in here now!
- No, sir, I do not concur...
and I do not recognize your authority
to relieve me on the command
under Navy regulations.
- Cob, arrest this man and get him out!
- Captain Ramsey...
under operating procedures governing
the release of nuclear weapons...
we cannot launch our missiles
unless both you and I agree!
- Cob, what are you waiting for?
- Now this is more than formality, sir.
This is why your command must
be repeated! It requires my assent!
I do not give it, and, furthermore,
you continue upon this course...
- and insist upon this launch without
confirming this message first...
- Son of a bitch.
- I will be forced,
backed by the rules of precedents...
- Chief of the boat...
- as captain and commanding
officer of the USS Alabama...
- authority and command...
- regulation 08150H6...
- I order you to place
the X.O. Under arrest...
- on the charge of mutiny!
- Of the Navy regulations...
- to relieve you...
- I say again, I order you...
- of command, Captain!
- To place the X.O. Under arrest...
on the charge of mutiny!
- Cob!
- Captain, please, the X.O. Is right.
We can't launch
unless he concurs.
"To the USS Alabama.
Rebel-controlled missiles
being fueled.
Launch codes compromised.
Dissidents threaten launch
at continental United States.
Set DEFCON two.
Immediately launch ten
Trident missile sorties."
They're fueling their missiles!
We don't have time to fuck around!
Sir, I think you need time
to think this over.
I don't have
to think this over!
Captain, I relieve you
of your command of this ship.
Cob, escort the captain
to his stateroom.
- I'm assuming command.
- You're not assuming anything.
Chief of the boat, Captain Ramsey's
under arrest. Lock him in his stateroom.
- Captain, please...
- Now, Cob!
Aye, sir.
Mitchell! Walker!
Take the captain below.
You're way out
of your league, Hunter.
You're not ready to make
tough decisions yet.
What the hell
we waitin' for?
Anybody here disagrees
with what I've done...
then you feel free
to relieve yourself of duty now.
Anybody?
All right.
- All stations.
- Aye, sir.
This is the Executive Officer.
I have assumed
command of this ship...
under authority granted me
by Navy regulations.
I have relieved Captain Ramsey of his
duties for acting in contravention...
of the rules and regulations
regarding nuclear weapons release.
It is my intention
to delay the missile launch...
maintaining our current state
of readiness...
pending confirmation
of an emergency action message...
- that was cut off during the attack.
-
Remain at battle stations missile.
Carry on.
What the hell
are we doin', Fred?
I don't know about you,
but I'm pissin' my pants.
Come on, boy.
Conn/Weapons: Russians will have
missile launch capability...
in 39 minutes.
Chief of the boat.
Sir?
Thank you, Cob.
"Thank you"?
Fuck you.
Get it straight, Mr. Hunter.
I'm not on your side.
Now you could be wrong.
But wrong or right, the captain can't
just replace you at will.
That was completely improper. And that's
why I did what I did, by the book.
I thank you anyway.
Radio/Conn: Mr. Zimmer, get
those communications back on line now.
We're working on it, sir.
Aye, aye, Captain.
- Are you ready?
- Uh... ready. Go.
Jesus.
This fuckin' thing...
You know, this whole system is crashed;
radio buoy is severed.
- What the fuck does he want us to do?
- Shit electrons?
Hey, Vossler, we need communications,
not smart-ass remarks.
- Aye, sir.
- All stop, ten degrees up.
- Ten up. Aye, sir.
- All stop. Aye, sir. Enters all stop.
-
- Conn/Sonar: Holy shit, sir!
He's right on top of us!
He's turning toward!
- Range?
- 600 yards!
Conn/Sonar: Torpedoes in the water!
Bearing 048, 050!
- Left full rudder!
- Left full rudder! Aye, sir!
All ahead full!
Zero bubble!
Sir, don't you want to fire back?
Torpedoes are ready, sir.
No, we're in too close.
Our weapons won't have time to arm.
All ahead flank! Chief of the watch
to maneuvering. Give me max speed now!
-
- Maximum speed! Aye, sir!
Sonar/Conn: Let me know when our range
to that Akula is open to 1,000 yards!
- Conn/Sonar: Aye, sir!
- Damn it! Let's just shoot this fucker!
- What's 1,000 yards for?
- 'Cause it takes 1,000 yards
for the torpedoes to arm!
Jesus! Who'd you fuck
to get on this ship?
-
- Conn/Sonar:
Torpedoes 150 yards
and closing fast, sir!
Bearing 070, 074!
Launch port countermeasures!
- Countermeasures away, sir!
- Rig ship for impact.
Rig ship for impact!
Aye, sir!
They missed! They missed!
They passed astern!
They were too close to arm, sir.
Conn/Sonar: Range to the Akula:
Go to manual on the arming mechanisms,
tubes two and four.
- Snapshot, two and four.
- Snapshot, two and four.
Tubes fired electrically, sir.
Sonar/Conn: Give me exact ranging
and speed on our weapons.
Range: 300 yards
at 50 knots, sir!
- 100 yards, 55 knots!
-
Weapons ready for arming, sir!
- Steady course 231.
- Aye, sir. 231.
Arm torpedoes
two and four... now!
Torpedoes armed, sir!
-
- We're locked on the Akula!
- You got him, sir! You got him!
-
-
-
Conn/Sonar: Incoming torpedo! They got
it off before they got hit, sir!
Right full rudder!
Launch starboard countermeasures!
- Countermeasures away, sir!
- Dive! Make your depth 1,200 feet!
Point it down now!
Take her deep! Take her deep!
Full dive on those planes!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Hang on, everybody!
-
Is everybody okay?
Yeah!
Open aft main drain suction!
Start the drain pump!
Go, go, go!
All stations,
make damage report to Control.
Control, this is Bilge Bay!
We've got out-of-control flooding!
-
- Request damage control!
- Mr. Mahoney, get a damage control
party down there!
- Aye, sir!
Forward damage control party,
get Lieutenant Hellerman!
Flooding in the bilge bay!
Get him down there now!
Conn/Maneuvering:
We've lost propulsion, sir!
- Chief of the boat, how we doin'?
- Sir, we are going down!
- I need propulsion!
- Forward ballast tanks are damaged, sir!
- Forward air pressure: Zero!
- Maneuvering/Conn:
Restore propulsion as soon as possible.
Conn/Maneuvering: Restoring propulsion
as soon as possible! Aye, sir!
Control/Bilge Bay:
Flooding is slowed!
I think we got it
under control, sir!
Passing 1,500 feet.
At 1,850 it's all over.
Passing 1,600 feet.
Barnes, get over here!
Help me with this loose valve!
Passing 1,650 feet.
- What the fuck is going on?
-  Take it easy.
Conn/Bilge Bay:
Flooding has recommenced!
It looks like three men are trapped!
Bilge Bay/Conn: Try and get those men
out of there and seal that bay.
Sir, if we don't seal the bilge bay now,
we'll lose the ship!
Bilge Bay/Conn:
Can you get the men out?
Sir, there's no fuckin' way!
If I go down there, I'll never get out!
Barnes, come on!
You've got to come!
Move, move! Barnes, come on, come on!
You can do it! Move it!
Bilge Bay/Conn:
Seal that bay.
Barnes, let's go! Come on!
I've got to close the hatch!
What the fuck
are we doing here?
Bilge Bay/Conn:
I say again, seal that bay.
Sir, there are men down there,
and they're gonna drown!
Lieutenant Hellerman,
you have your orders!
Now seal the goddamn bay
before we all go down!
Barnes!
Please get the fuck out!
Barnes!
Come on!
Barnes!
Conn/Bilge Bay:
Seawater hatch is sealed, sir!
Very well.
Passing 1,800 feet.
Approaching hull crush depth, sir.
Conn/Maneuvering:
Turbine power restored!
Main seawater cross valve repaired!
- And rising.
- Propulsion limit! Ahead full, sir!
- Take us up to periscope depth.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Give me five.
All right, we're livin'.
We're livin', gentlemen.
- Step aside, Tommy.
- I'm sorry, sir. The X.O. Ordered...
Fuck the X.O.!
This ship has been hit,
and I'm going in to see my captain.
Now stand aside.
Stand aside!
Captain?
- Sir.
- How bad is it, Mr. Dougherty?
- It's bad, sir.
- I've just been looking
at Hunter's file here.
The closest to combat he's been
is a policy seminar.
Give me an order, sir.
As quietly as you can, you get
to Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Westergaurd.
How about Linkletter?
Nah, you won't be able to talk
to the TSO. He's at the conn.
But you can get to Weps.
We got to have Weps. He's the key.
You get me those men, a small security
force; then come back and get me.
Aye, sir.
Don't get overzealous and
try to recruit the whole ship.
We'll lead from the top down.
Aye, sir. Right away.
The radio's 50%.
Can I talk to you
in the passageway?
Right now, Pete.
Come on.
What's goin' on?
We're not gonna let this go down
with the X.O. At the helm.
- We're not?
- No, we're not. I've been
with the captain for years...
and this asshole Hunter
shows up, and I'm supposed
to follow him 'cause he says so?
You're not supposed to;
you've been ordered to.
That's what this is about:
Proper orders.
Proper orders? He has proper orders.
He won't act on them.
He's in command now!
If they order him to launch, we'll
launch, and we'll blow 'em all to hell.
But I'd rather go down myself
than get this one wrong.
Look, our procedures are clear.
In the absence of a contravening order,
in a situation like this...
- we follow the orders in hand.
- Exactly.
You know how many checks we do to make
sure a launch order is authentic?
The X.O. Agreed
with those orders.
Now he just wants to throw them away?
They don't count?
- He's lost his nerve.
- Bullshit! I know this guy, Bobby!
Weps, we've been ordered to launch.
Now why in the world would we do that if
they weren't prepared to launch at us?
We don't know that for sure.
That's the whole point.
That's why he wants time
to confirm the message.
That's the whole fucking point is
we don't have time!
Radchenko is fueling his birds.
Now why do you think he's doing that?
Why? You don't put on a condom
unless you gonna fuck!
Go back to your station.
Go back to your station and stay there.
Come on, man.
Peter, think about your family, man.
I am. I am!
I mean, what do you...
What do you plan to do?
Nothing without you.
You're senior officer department head.
The TSO's with Hunter.
And you have the keys
to the small arms locker.
Now we want to recruit a few more men,
and then we're gonna open that arsenal.
I just talked
to the captain in his room.
He specifically asked for you.
He says we cannot go
without you.
I don't believe this.
This is a mutiny, Peter.
There's only two sides
to a mutiny.
Now, your captain
is asking for your help.
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
All right.
Conn/Weapons: Russian missiles
will have launch capability...
in 24 minutes.
You're doing the right thing.
Electrical power has been restored.
-
- All stations, prepare to
reinitiate the system.
Radio/Conn: Mr. Zimmer, what's the
status on that radio repair?
Conn/Radio: All systems are still
down, sir. Lieutenant Zimmer isn't here.
- Where is he?
-  I don't know, sir.
Very well.
- Mr. Mahoney has the conn.
- Aye, sir. I have the conn.
- Cob.
- Sir?
- Send a man and find Zimmer.
- Aye, sir.
- Get a side arm.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Chief Young.
- Aye, Chief.
Turn around!
Move it!
-
- At ease, sailor.
-
- Sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Ince.
-
- Mr. Westergaurd.
- Sir.
- Mr. Zimmer.
-  Ready, sir.
Let's get on with it.
-
-  Stand guard.
All you people,
return to your stations!
- Mr. Rivetti.
- Sir?
- Follow me, please.
- Yes, sir.
Is there a problem, sir?
These are the keys
to the entire submarine.
Conn/Weapons:
Russian missiles...
will have launch capability
in 21 minutes.
Who's in charge here?
Shit!
Me, sir. Oh, fuck.
- How long is it gonna take?
- I don't know, sir.
- Do you know what's going on here?
- Yes, sir.
No, I don't think you do.
Let me explain it to you.
If we launch and we're wrong...
what's left of Russia
is gonna launch at us.
There will be a nuclear holocaust
beyond imagination.
So it's all about knowing,
Mr. Vossler.
We have to know whether or not our order
to launch has been recalled or not.
The only way we're gonna know is if
you fix that radio. You understand me?
Yes, sir.
You ever watch Star Trek?
- Yeah, I seen Star Trek.
- Star Trek. You know, Star Trek.
The USS Enterprise. All right.
You remember when the Klingons
were gonna blow up the Enterprise?
And Captain Kirk calls down to Scotty,
"Scotty, I gotta have more power."
- He needs more, more warp speed. Yeah.
- Warp speed. Exactly.
Well, I'm Captain Kirk.
You're Scotty. I need more power.
If you do not get this radio up,
a billion people are gonna die.
It's up to you. I know that's a shitty
deal, but you got it. Can you handle it?
Scotty?
Aye, Captain.
You got anything?
- No, Vossler.
- Then get on it.
- I have the conn.
-  X.O. Has the conn.
Chief of the boat,
make your depth 75 feet.
Continue up
to periscope depth.
- Belay that order!
-
Any officers or chiefs feel you've been
unjustly caught up in this thing...
you stand with me now.
Sir, propulsion
has been restored.
All flooding
has been contained.
All communications
are still down.
Take him away.
Lock him up
in the officers' mess.
Of all the people.
Weps, return to missile control.
Mr. Zimmer, you stay with me.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- The rest of you,
return to your stations.
Inform your men directly
that the captain is in command.
- I have the conn.
- Captain has the conn.
Diving officer,
make your depth 150 feet.
- At 150 feet. Aye, sir.
- 1MC.
Aye, sir.
May I have
your attention, please.
Crew of the USS Alabama...
attempted mutiny has been put down.
We'll maintain security alert.
Authorized movement
only in two-man teams.
In the absence
of further radio communication...
on orders from
the National Command Center...
we'll achieve launch depth
as quickly as we can...
for strategic missile launch.
We all know what this means.
It's not something
one would wish for...
but we have the obligation
under authenticated orders...
issued by our Commander-ln-Chief

Aye, sir.
Look, it's not a mutiny.
I did everything by the book.
It's not about the book.
If the Russians are gonna launch
and we do nothing, who's gonna stop 'em?
Half of me is glad the captain
came back. He could be right, you know.
No orders are valid, Cob,
if they're wrong.
- We don't know if they're wrong.
- That's true. We don't know.
That's why we have
to find out first.
What if Radchenko surrendered
and it's over? Hmm?
We launch. They see us.
They launch.
Our birds pass each other
in the air. Boom!
- What do you got?
- Nuclear war.
Nuclear holocaust.
- What are you doing down here?
- Jesus, I was just going to the bath...
Rivetti, nobody moves alone!
Come on. You know the drill.
- What, Bennefield, I need
an escort to take a shit?
- Shut up!
Now I'm gonna call Control.
You stay right there.
- Fuck that.
- I mean it, man.
Okay, Moebius,
open the door.
- You broke my nose, man.
- Shut up, fat boy.
- Mr. Rivetti, I'm impressed.
- I never liked him, sir.
Rivetti, go to laundry. Get four sets
of coveralls and four caps.
-  Aye, sir.
- Just relax.
Davis. Can I talk
to you a second?
Come on.
- Everybody ready?
- Let's do it.
- We're with you, sir.

launch capability in 12 minutes.
Opening missile hatches.
- Weps.
- Weps, this is Hunter. Listen to me.
- Where are you?
- Don't worry about where I am.
You cannot proceed. We got other ships
out there that can handle this.
You can't be influenced by the captain
or anybody else. Make up your own mind.
-
- Conn/Weapons:
Estimated time to missile launch:
Three minutes and counting, sir.
Weps, Weps, listen.
Don't do this.
Don't do this.
Once you launch, they cannot come back.
They cannot come back, Weps.
And you know the repercussions
if we're wrong, goddamn it!
Weps, if we fire now, we'll be firing
while we're blind and crippled.
You understand me?
- Where the fuck are you?
- Do not remove that firing trigger!
Do not open the safe, Weps!
It's up to you!
You're the only one that knows
the combination! It's up to you, Weps!
It's up to you.
Mind your fuckin' panel!
- You guys ready?
- Just about, sir.
Radio/X. O: Vossler?
X.O. /Radio: Sir...
- I don't know, sir.
- Vossler, calm down. Just calm down.
- Take a deep breath. Are you calm?
- Yeah, sort of.
Get the radio fixed, Vossler.
I could have built one by now.
How long is it gonna take you?
I don't know.
Well, how much time
do you need?
Shit!
Let's go.
Missile tubes 1 - 5
and 20 - 24 at 1Sq, sir.
Ship is hovering on automatic.

- Aye, sir. I have the conn.
What are you doing, man?
We're at 1Sq. We're ready.
- Mr. Dougherty.
- Aye.
- Station your guards fore and aft.
- Last two, forward hatch!
First two, aft hatch!
They're gonna fire
from missile control.
We've got to get back to the conn
and disarm the system. Come on.
We'll travel
in the crawl spaces.
Mr. Ince!
Mr. Ince, remove
the tactical firing key.
Sir, it is my duty to...
Son, don't talk to me about duty.
Open the fucking safe!
I can't do that, sir.
I'm gonna count to three...
and then I'm gonna blow
your fucking head off.
One.
Two.
Shit!
It does me no good
to kill you.
You're the only one
that knows the combination.
However...
Petty Officer Hilaire
doesn't know the combination!
Millions of lives at stake here, Peter!
Don't make a dumb decision! One!
- Two!
- Sir!
- Cob!
- Yo.
You and Hunsicker are going
to enter the conn from the bow.
Rivetti, Linkletter and myself
will come in through the aft.
You jump right on Zimmer, okay?
Come on, come on!
- Fire control ready?
- Aye, sir.
- Launcher ready?
-  Aye, sir.
Initiate fire.
- Freeze! Hold it, sir!
-  Drop the weapon now!
Move forward! Move forward!
Move, move, move! Get his pistol!
- Fire one!
- Number one did not fire, sir.
Sir, the captain's key
has been removed.
Hunter.
- You're a piece of shit.
- Son of a bitch.
- All right, you and you,
man the forward hatches.
- Aye, sir.
-  You, man the aft hatches.
- Aye, sir.
We're going up
to periscope depth.
We're gonna reestablish communications
and get that radio message.
Now anybody got a problem with that?
- Chief of the boat,
make your depth 78 feet.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Make your depth 78 feet.
Five degree up bubble.

- Radio/Conn:
Mr. Vossler, this is Captain Kirk.
I need warp speed on that radio.
- Yes, sir.
- Conn/Weapons:

- Reattach that lead!
Seventy-eight feet!
At periscope depth, sir!

- No close contact, sir.
Very well. Chief of the watch,
raise the VLF radio antenna.
Raise the VLF antenna.
Aye, sir.
- VLF antenna coming up!
-
Conn/Radio: Sir, I think
she's breathing. We're getting close.
- Halt, sir!
- Shoot me.
- Shit. Shit.
- I got him.
I have the conn.
Give me my missile key.
Give me the missile key,
Mr. Hunter.
I'm the commander of this
fucking ship! Give me that goddamn key!
Conn/Weapons: Russian missiles will have
launch capability in seven minutes.
Conn/Radio: Sir!
Radio/Conn!
Captain/Radio: Vossler, sir. She's
breathing again! We are really close!
You got three minutes, Vossler.
- Three minutes and counting!
- Yes, sir.
You got three minutes.
- Come on.
-
Come on, Vossler. Come on,
come on. Keep it going, keep it going.
Speaking of horses...
did you ever see
those Lipizzaner stallions?
What?
From Portugal.
The Lipizzaner stallions.
The most highly trained horses
in the world. They're all white.
Yes, sir.
"Yes, sir" you're aware
they're all white...
or "Yes, sir" you've seen them?
Yes, sir, I've seen them.
Yes, sir, I'm aware
that they're all white.
They're not from Portugal;
they're from Spain...
and at birth, they're not white;
they're black.
Sir.
I didn't know that.
But they are from Portugal.
-
- Come on, Vossler. Come on.
- Yes. Yes.
- Come on. Come on. You got it.
Some of the things they do,
uh, defy belief.
Their training program
is simplicity itself.
You just stick
a cattle prod up their ass...
and you can get a horse
to deal cards.
Simple matter of voltage.
You're gonna get it. Come on.
-
- I almost had it. You saw it.
Conn/Weapons: Russian missiles will have
launch capability in four minutes.
- There you go! There you go!
- Ah, shit!
Look, look, look! Look at it, Vossler!
There we go, there we go!
- Yes!
-
Conn/Radio:
We are receiving flash traffic.
Emergency action message. Recommend
alert one. Recommend alert one.
- Fuck, yeah!
-
Alert one. Alert one.
Dougherty, Westergaurd, Zimmer.
- Get that EAM.
- Aye, aye, sir.
God help you
if you're wrong.
If I'm wrong,
then we're at war.
God help us all.
Sir, we have a properly formatted
emergency action message...
from the National Command
Authority, sir.
- Request permission to authenticate.
- Permission granted.
Authenticate.
"Delta, Delta, Sierra,
Bravo, Zulu, Delta, Tango."
"Delta, Delta, Sierra,
Bravo, Zulu, Delta, Tango."
- Message is authentic, Captain.
- I concur, sir.
I concur, sir.
Message is authentic.
Crew of the Alabama,
this is the captain.
Set condition 2Sq.
Terminate launch,
all missiles.
All right!
All right!
Mr. Hunter has the conn.
In the early hours of this morning,
Russian army forces moved in...
and met surprisingly
little resistance.
-
- There were some sporadic battles...
-
- There were some sporadic battles...
but, apparently, the specter
of fighting their countrymen...
proved too much for these rebel troops,
and they surrendered quickly.
So a crisis that seemed to be escalating
beyond the point of no return...
was ultimately resolved with fewer
than a hundred soldiers dead.
And the nuclear base captured by
Radchenko is back in government hands.
Reporting live from the French aircraft
carrier Foch in the Mediterranean Sea...
this is Richard Valeriani for CNN.
All right, stand there, uh, Lieutenant
Commander Hunter. This won't take long.
This panel has convened in order
to investigate the events...
subsequent to the setting
of condition 1Sq...
for strategic missile launch...
on board the USS Alabama
on 1 November.
Now, based on the testimony
from personnel on board the Alabama...
and, in no small measure, to that
of the senior officer, Captain Ramsey...
I am prepared to make
my recommendations to SUBPAC.
- Without my testimony, sir?
- You have a problem with that?
- I might, sir.
- I have known Captain Ramsey
for almost 30 years.
We served together
on more than a few occasions.
If he is lying, this will be
the first I've heard of it.
- Yes, sir.
- My primary concern here...
is the breakdown in the system.
In this instance,
the system failed...
because the two senior officers did not
work to resolve their differences...
while preserving
the chain of command.
Now you may have been
proven right, Mr. Hunter...
but insofar as
the letter of the law is concerned...
you were both right.
And you were also both wrong.
This is the dilemma that will
occupy this panel, this Navy...
and this country's armed forces
as a whole...
long after you leave this room.
Off the record, you've both
created one hell of a mess:
A mutiny aboard a United States
nuclear submarine...
violation of nuclear
launch protocol.
For the record, it is
the conclusion of this panel...
that your actions
aboard the Alabama...
were consistent with
the best traditions of the Navy...
and in the interests
of the United States.
As such, the recommendations
of this panel will be to accept...
in a manner reflective of his long
and dedicated service to his country...
Captain Ramsey's request
for early retirement from active duty.
And based, in no small part,
on Captain Ramsey's recommendation...
that Lieutenant Commander Hunter
be given his next command...
at the earliest possible convenience.
Unless, of course, you wish
to challenge these recommendations.
No, sir.
- Captain Ramsey?
- No, sir.
Dismissed.
Captain?
Just wanted
to say thank you.
You were right,
and I was wrong.
About the horses,
the Lipizzaners.
They are from Spain,
not Portugal.
Yes, sir.
