Man in the fucking water.
Shit. Stick to their own fucking side, man.
Cheeky fucking midgets.
Oi. Check your arcs, Rambo.
Woah, woah, woah woah, Mowgli!
I'm here trying to bring fucking peace and
love to your shitty stone-age country.
Is it too much to be able
to enjoy a rinse without
taking indirect fucking
fire from you lot?
Let that be a lesson to ya.
Go on, fuck off now then.
Ever heard the one
about not walking into a room
until you know how
you're walking out of there, Tug?
We all miss our birds, mucker. No need
to start grooming the local nippers.
Fuck off.
Grenade fishing -
nearly catch of the fucking day, me.
Hey, no harm done.
TWO, yeah?
First lesson my grandma taught me, Tug.
Don't pick a fight with an armed midget.
We're a long way from home.
What you talking about,
you're from Huddersfield.
Go on, mate.
- Cheers.
Race you back up?
Ah, you're fully loaded, mate.
Unfair fight.
OK, go! Now!
Signals?
- Yeah, mate. Cheers.
Come on then, what's the news?
Heard there was a heatwave back home.
Typical, innit?
- Heatwave? Pissed it down, mate.
Anyway, where's the FLET?
FLET? Hat!
It's all around you, mate.
Terry pokes his nose up here.
We smash him back into his hole.
Bosh!
Did you bring it?
- In the back, pal.
My guy tells me something's coming.
They got a new field commander.
Keep your eyes open.
Sure, John. Cheers.
Civvies here?
- Yank security.
They look after the engineers
working on the darn.
Talk about hearts and minds
this joint would supply electricity
to half of bloody Helmand
if someone could work
out how to turn it on.
So where have you been?
- Ops room, Bastion. Sangin, then here.
Ah, Sangin. Proper tasty, right?
- Telling me.
Is this us?
- Nah. OMLTs.
Teaching the ANA which end
of a weapon's the noisy bit.
We're up top, mate.
So what's it like up here?
- Right, OK, fellas...
It's going on, that's what it is, mucker.
I quit the reg after Telic:
Zero contacts, mate.
I joined back when Herrick was on.
Finally get a piece of the action.
Rather be in the scrum than on a
subs bench, do you know what I mean?
Not really.
Rugby's a real game, mate.
Taliban should play it. Tough bastards.
I'm pretty sure Afghans don't play rugby.
Here, look, look, look.
Give us a lift up, pal?
- Hop on, Tug.
Do one, Presser'.
- Good for you, hat.
Fucking dick swinger.
Hop on, Mark!
Did they come?
- Dunno, look in here, Spud.
Sergeant McMellon. Signaller Jones.
Shit the fucking bed!
I hope you know how to use a radio
without batteries, Signaller Jones.
For fuck's sake.
Right, welfare box. Who wants it?

Any decent scoff though, we split it, yeah?
Prosser, stop twatting about

Fusilier AL Barlow's got his porn re-sup.

No, first time.
Aye, ar, mortar boys,

him around, mate.
Well, we know where
your basha is, Barlow.
Keep an eye open, that's
all I'm saying, mate.
Look.
Luke, boat came in, mate.
Skin 'em up will you.
Prosser, catch you up there, pal.

Fuck it. Ten quid. Thanks Aunt Pam,

In here's the interpreter's place.

Right, put it away. You gotta be
careful flashing it about this lot.
What is it? Long time on the hill.
Gungy mortars? The rumours are true, pal.
Not that they'd go near that rancid thing.
Oh, yeah.

Happy birthday.
He says make sure you save 'em

Seventh. Why, what are we now?
Unlucky, pal. Fifth.
Fuck that. I'm not waiting

Oh. You taking heat up here?
Nah, I get more contact

I mean it were busy for a bit but
Terry's pissed off back to Sangin.
We own all this high ground.
Out of small arms range.
A few Chinese rockets, bit of boom
boom in the valley, but that's it.
Lucky cos we're out of ammo.
Nah, boredom or ANA'll get you
before Terry does.
Right. Jonesy, yeah?
- Yeah.
Antibiotics, anti-inflammatories.
Take one of each before each meal.

I thought you knew your fucking history.
Just fucking guess, will you,

You got three guesses and then

This is a fucking stitch-up.

When you're wounded and

For fuck's sake.

Perspective on what?

We need a winch, pal.

We've got a stretcher.
We should have enough
bodies to keep him level.
Have you seen how
fucking steep it is?
- Just cut the corner,
go up the re-entrant.
No way are we leaving the path.
I'm saying stick tight, wait here
for the heli. That's my opinion.
Mark, what you thinking?
We need to pull him away from the rocks.
Get him in the open.
There, the raised bank.
Alright.

Then they shut the door,
turned out the lights
and that was it.
I cried like a burst fucking drain.
Then they came back in though, yeah?

No. They fucking forgot.
But this is shitter.
Well, we can do something

Tug. Stay on fucking target, man.
My leg still fucking hurts.
Tug, this fucking morphine isn't working.
There ain't no more, Ken.
Tug.
Tug, give me another stick.
MARK:
Don't you fucking drop.
Just fucking give it me, pal.
Don't you drop, Stu.
Don't you dare fucking drop.
You hang in there, mate.
You fucking hear me?
We're 3 Para and we're going

We are 3 fucking Para.

Water?
What?

There we go.
That's it, pal.
OK?
- I'm good. I'm finished. Fucking...
it's disgusting, man.
Hey, give us a minute, man.
I think I've got
a bottle of champagne
in the fucking bag.
Looks like you're out of luck, mate.
It's funny...
- What's that?
My mum always said
I was born under a lucky star.
How?
Kept on winning things,
you know, like raffles and stuff.
Yeah.
I won her a pair of diamond
earrings at the Sabre Centre.
She always wore them when I came home.
And I've always felt lucky.
My life.
My job.
Gill.
So lucky.
PEARSON:
You're no' fucking wrong, Mark.
You're the luckiest guy I know, mate.
You could sail through
a shit storm, buddy
and come out smelling
of fuckin' roses. Eh?
TUG:
There you go.
You'll come out of this as well, too, pal.
I think my luck's run out, guys.
No, pal, you just gotta...
you just gotta hold on.
Just hold on, pal.
I'm cold, Tug.
I'm fucking cold.
Not long now, Mark.
We'll have you out of here.
I'm going, I can feel it,
I'm fucking dying...
- No, you're... you're not.
I am.
- No, you're not. You're alright... Fine...
Tell Gill that I love her.
Tell her I want her to be happy...
want her to marry some other fella.
I ain't fuckin'...
Shut up with all that shit now.
Tell my mum and dad that I love them.
Tell them have a piss-up on me
at the Minto.
No cash bar.
Tell them to look after my dog.
You fuckin' getting this?
- I'm with you.
PEARSON:
Shut the fuck up, Mark.
This time next week, mate...
we're gonna be drinking
cold lager in the Fox, buddy.
Telling our fuckin' war stories.
Impressin' the fuckin' locals, eh?
Tell my uncle that I died
being a good soldier, eh? A good Para.
Would do, mate, but you're not fuckin'
dying, eh, you big squeeze.
We'll get you out of here...
- Yeah.
Just fuckin' hold on, pal. Eh?
You hold on.
Fuck!
- Fuck! No!
Cover up!
Tell him it's a fuckin' mine field!
It's a minefield.
- It's a fucking mine field!
Fuckin' mine field! Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa! No!
It's a fuckin' mine field!
Watch your step.
Hang on!
- Wait till your guys know.
It's a mine field.
Right. Right guys, come on.
Let's get him over there now.
See you fuckin' soon, man. Alright?
- Give me my fucking rifle!
Watch your heads, right, lads!
Watch your fuckin' heads!

You're up! You're up!
OK, got him.
Prepare to change.

This guy's a fuckin' hero.
Stu? Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Is he OK?
- He's gonna be alright, buddy.
Out... stop. Right, take over. And away.
Did they all get out?
Yes, Mark. They all got out.
Mark? Mark? Crash!
Need morphine.
SPUD:
Any of you who were in there
I want you down on the HLS.
Get yourselves checked out.
Here's a new place, here are new faces
and yet you are all that I see.
There is your T-shirt, there is your
jacket and that's how your hair used to be.
Come with me through
the sand and the snow.
Run with me as the rain
starts to flow.
I'll dream of you every night
and I'll love you for all of my life.
You will be close as we all make a toast
to the good times, the new and the old.
Sharing the night,
we all laughed till we
cried at the stories and
jokes that you told.
Stand with us as we all reunite.
Dance with us till the sky becomes light.
We'll think of you every night
and we'll love you for all of our lives.
I can't pretend I felt fine at the end
as I watched you walk out and leave.
But I hear your voice as you made your
choice and said, this is the life for me.
We hear your laugh
in the stories we tell.
Remember your smile
as you waved us farewell.
We'll think of you every night
and we'll love you for all of our lives.
Run with me through
the sand and the snow.
Hold me close as the rain
starts to flow.
I'll be with you every night
and I'll love you for all of my life.
