Ten hut!
Be seated.
Now, I want you
to remember...
that no bastard
ever won a war...
by dying
for his country.
He won it...
by making
the other poor dumb bastard
die for his country.
Men...
all this stuff
you've heard
about America
not wanting to fight,
wanting to stay
out of the war,
is a lot of horse dung.
Americans traditionally
love to fight.
All real Americans
love the sting of battle.
When you were kids...
you all admired
the champion marble shooter,
the fastest runner,
big league ball players,
the toughest boxers.
Americans love a winner...
and will not
tolerate a loser.
Americans play to win
all the time.
I wouldn't give
a hoot in hell
for a man
who lost and laughed.
That's why Americans
have never lost,
and will never lose, a war.
Because the very thought
of losing...
is hateful to Americans.
Now...
an army... is a team.
It lives, eats, sleeps,
fights as a team.
This individuality stuff
is a bunch of crap.
The bilious bastards
who wrote that stuff
about individuality for
The Saturday Evening Post...
don't know anything more
about real battle
than they do
about fornicating.
Now, we have the finest
food and equipment...
the best spirit...
and the best men
in the world.
You know...
by God, I... actually pity
those poor bastards
we're going up against...
by God, I do.
We're not just going
to shoot the bastards.
We're going to cut out
their living guts
and use them to grease
the treads of our tanks.
We're going to murder
those lousy Hun bastards
by the bushel.
Now...
some of you boys, I know,
are wondering...
whether or not
you'll chicken out under fire.
Don't worry about it.
I can assure you...
that you will all
do your duty.
The Nazis... are the enemy.
Wade into them.
Spill their blood.
Shoot them in the belly.
When you put your hand...
into a bunch of goo...
that a moment before
was your best friend's face...
you'll know what to do.
Now, there's another thing
I want you to remember.
I don't want to get
any messages
saying that we are
holding our position.
We're not holding anything.
Let the Hun do that.
We are advancing constantly,
and we're not interested
in holding onto anything
except the enemy.
We're going to hold onto him
by the nose,
and we're going to kick him
in the ass.
We're going to kick the hell
out of him all the time,
and we're going
to go through him
like crap
through a goose!
Now...
there's one thing...
that you men
will be able to say
when you get back home.
And you may
thank God for it.
sitting around your fireside
with your grandson
on your knee...
and he asks you
what did you do
in the great World War II...
you won't have to say...
well...
I shoveled shit
in Louisiana.
All right, now,
you sons of bitches,
you know how I feel.
Go on now.
I will be proud...
to lead you
wonderful guys into battle
anytime...
anywhere.
That's all.
Arabs need food
and clothing.
They strip our dead before
we can even bury them.
Looks like the reports
were pretty accurate.
not counting mortars,
machine guns, rifles,
pistols, telescopes,
belt buckles, G.I. S' socks...
Our people
salute you, General,
for your brilliant
amphibious landing
on the continent
of Africa
and your enlightened
administration
of our country.
I've enjoyed being here,
Excellency.
Naturally,
I'd prefer to be
in Tunisia
fighting the Germans.
The lions in their dens
tremble at his approach.
I appreciate that,
Excellency.
Magnificent.
I wish our troops
looked that good.
Tell me, General,
what do you
think of Morocco?
I love it, Excellency.
It's a combination of
the Bible... and Hollywood.
These men fight
at Kasserine?
Yes, sir.
For the American army
to take a licking
like that
the first time at bat
against the Germans...
Up against Rommel,
we need the best
tank man we've got.
Somebody tough enough
to pull this outfit together.
- Patton?
- Possibly.
God help us.
- Lieutenant...
- Sheesh.
Where's
the duty officer?
Billy. I think he's in
his quarters, shaving.
Why isn't he
here on duty?
Guess he needed to shave.
We got a new commanding
general due today.
Who the hell's
kicking me in the butt?
Oh, sorry,
uh, sir!
What were you doing
down there, soldier?
Trying to get
some sleep, sir.
Well, get back
down there, son.
You're the only son of a bitch
in this headquarters
that knows what
he's trying to do.
Yes, sir.
Brad,
how the hell are you?
Fine, George.
Good to see you.
We all thought you wouldn't
be here till 0900.
Yes.
I gathered that.
You know my boys
DickJenson, Al Stiller?
Yes.
Brad, tell me, uh...
what are you
doing here?
Ike wanted a report
on this Kasserine business.
I'm staying here
as an observer,
but I report
directly to Ike.
A spy.
Get me General Eisenhower's
headquarters.
Tell me, Brad, uh...
what happened
at Kasserine?
I heard it was
a shamble.
Apparently,
everything went wrong.
We'd send over
a 75-millimeter shell,
the Krauts would
return an 88.
Their tanks are diesels.
And even when we managed
to hit them,
they kept on running.
Our tanks...
the men call them
"Purple Heart boxes."
One hot piece of shrapnel
and the gasoline explodes.
Hmm. I warned them
about the tank.
I talked to a soldier
about the half-tracks.
I asked if
the machine gun bullets
pierce the armor,
and he said, " No, sir.
The bullets just
come through one side
and rattle around
a bit."
I understand
we had trouble
coordinating
the air cover.
The trouble was
no air cover.
General Smith
on the line, sir.
Excuse me, Brad.
Bill?
Listen, I'm calling
about, uh, Bradley
and his job here.
Look, I need a good
number-two man.
I want to make Brad
my deputy commander.
You'll clear it
with Ike?
Thanks, Bill.
Now you're not spying
for Eisenhower anymore.
You're working for me.
- O. K?
- Fine, O.K.
Dick... you've
got those stars?
- Yes, sir.
- Let's get them on.
What's the matter, Brad?
I've been nominated
by the president.
I know, but, uh,
it doesn't become official
until it's approved
by the Senate.
Well... they have
their schedule,
and I have mine.
George...
if you were named admiral
of the Turkish Navy,
I believe your aides
could dip
into their haversacks
and come up with
the appropriate badge of rank.
Anyway, congratulations...
premature
congratulations.
You know...
I think those stars
would look better
on a green shirt.
Did I ever tell you
about the time
I designed a uniform
for tank crewmen?
It was, uh, green leather,
had red stripes,
and had sort of
a row of brass buttons
down across here.
And topped off by
a gold football helmet.
The army rejected it,
of course.
Goddamn, it was beautiful.
Lloyd Fredendall's
just leaving.
George...
there's one other thing
I put
in my Kasserine report.
Some of our boys were
just plain scared.
Well, that's
understandable.
Even the best foxhound's
gun-shy the first time out.
I can remember...
when nothing
frightened me as much
as the idea of a bullet
coming for my nose.
I don't know why,
but the image of a bullet
coming for my nose
was more horrible than
any other possibility.
Well, I can understand
that, George.
It was such
a handsome nose.
You want to know
why this outfit
got the hell
kicked out of it?
A blind man could
see it in a minute.
They don't look like soldiers,
they don't act like soldiers.
Why should they be expected
to fight like soldiers?
You're
absolutely right.
The discipline's
pretty poor.
In about 15 minutes,
we're going to start
turning these boys
into fanatics, razors.
They'll lose their fear
of the Germans.
I only hope to God
they never lose
their fear of me.
Up bright and early, General.
Uh, breakfast?
Am I to understand that all
my officers have finished breakfast?
We're open from
Most of the officers
are just coming in.
Please inform these officers
the mess hall is closed.
But, sir, it's only
a quarter to 8:00.
From now on,
you will open at 6:00,
and no one will be
admitted after 6:15.
Where are your leggings?
Leggings?
Well, hell. General,
sir, I'm a cook.
You're a soldier.
$20 fine.
Gentlemen...
from this moment,
any man without leggings,
without a helmet,
without a tie...
any man with unshined shoes
or a soiled uniform...
is going to be skinned.
This is a barracks.
It's not a bordello.
- Morning, boy.
- Morning, sir.
Ah, Doctor.
Morning, sir.
I understand
you have two cases
of, uh, self-inflicted
wounds.
Yes, sir, we do.
Get them out of here.
Sir, one has developed
a very serious infection.
I don't care if he dies.
Get him someplace
but out of here.
He doesn't belong with
men wounded in battle.
- Yes, sir.
- One more thing.
There'll be no battle
fatigue in my command.
- That's an order.
- Yes, sir.
Battle fatigue
is a free ride,
a yellow-belly's ticket
to the hospital.
I'm not going to
subsidize cowardice.
Yes, sir.
Uh, Doctor...
where's your helmet?
I don't wear a helmet
when I'm in the hospital, General.
Start.
I can't use my stethoscope
when I'm wearing my helmet.
Well...
then cut two holes
in your helmet
so that you can.
And get
those yellow-bellies
out of here... today.
Hold it.
Turn right here.
Sir, the battlefield
is straight ahead.
Please don't argue
with me.
I can smell
a battlefield.
He was here
just yesterday.
It's over there.
Turn right, damn it.
It was here.
The battlefield
was here.
The Carthaginians
defending the city...
were attacked by
three Roman legions.
The Carthaginians
were proud and brave,
but they couldn't hold.
They were massacred.
Arab women...
stripped them
of their tunics
and their swords
and lances.
The soldiers lay
naked in the sun.
I was here.
You don't believe me,
do you, Brad?
You know what
the poet said.
"Through the travail
of ages...
amidst the pomp
and toils of war...
have I fought and strove
and perished...
countless times
upon the star.
As if through a glass
and darkly...
the age-old strife
I see...
where I fought in many guises,
many names...
but always me."
You know who
the poet was?
Me.
There's an opportunity
here now,
for us to mount
an offensive.
We've concentrated on harassing
the enemy's flank,
draw strength
away from the British.
However, it appears now,
that we could split
the Afrika Korps
and drive through
Rommel to the sea.
Sorry, Mel, but that
territory's been reserved
for General Sir
Bernard Law Montgomery.
We're supposed
to let him win
no matter how long
it takes him.
They're entitled
to have their hero.
After all, Montgomery
did push Rommel
clear across
North Africa.
What about
the Americans?
Don't they...
need a hero, too?
You have anybody
in mind, George?
Excuse me, sir.
Air Vice-Marshal Coningham
is here with General Buford.
Excuse me, gentlemen, while
I ask our British friends
what's happened
to our air cover.
Round one coming up.
Harry, how are you?
George,
good to see you.
Uh, George, you know
Arthur Coningham?
- Sure.
- Delighted to see you, General.
I've heard
so much about you.
Gentlemen,
it appears there's been
some slight
misunderstanding here,
and Ike thought we ought to
get it straightened it out.
No. No misunderstanding.
We're supposed to have
Allied air cover,
and we don't get it.
German planes are
strafing my troops.
If I may say so, General,
I'm afraid your operations
reports are inaccurate.
Reports?
The Krauts chased my command car
into a ditch.
My staff has assured me
we have complete air supremacy
everywhere
in the Mediterranean.
When I complained about
lack of air cover,
you said our troops
were not battle-worthy.
You spoke of the, uh,
discredited practice
of using air force
as an alibi
for lack of success
on the ground.
It's bad enough I have
to wet-nurse Montgomery.
I don't have
to stand for that.
I sincerely apologize
for that remark...
whoever made it...
and I promise you
one thing, General.
You will see
no more German planes.
You were discussing air
supremacy, Sir Arthur?
Damn door
won't open!
By God, by God,
that's enough!
Get that thing
out of here!
Come on, you bastards!
Take a shot at me,
right in the nose!
Get back in here,
George!
We need
a corps commander,
not a casualty!
How the devil did you
manage to stage that?
I don't know.
If I could find
the Nazi sons of bitches
flying those things,
I'd give them
each a medal.
Can't get over how cold
it gets in the desert.
Awfully cold, sir.
Rommel's out there somewhere
waiting for me.
Yes, sir.
You know...
if I had my way,
I'd send that genius
son of a bitch...
an engraved invitation
in iambic pentameter.
A challenge
in two stanzas
to meet me out there,
alone in the desert.
I'll deliver it.
Rommel in his tank
and me in mine.
We'd stop
about 20 paces.
We'd get out
and shake hands.
Then we'd button up
and we'd do battle,
just the two of us.
And that battle
would decide
the outcome
of the war.
It's too bad jousting's
gone out of style.
It's like your poetry,
General.
It isn't part of
the twentieth century.
Maybe you're right,
Dick.
The world grew up.
Hell of a shame.
Dick, I want
a 24-hour guard
put around
this area.
The damn Arabs
will dig them up
just to get
their clothes.
Yes, sir.
Our graves aren't
going to disappear
like everybody else's
who fought here.
The Greeks,
the Romans...
the Carthaginians.
God, how I hate
the twentieth century.
General?
General?
What is it?
Sir, we intercepted
a German radio message.
Rommel's 10th Panzer is going
to hit us near El Guettar.
Rommel, huh?
All my life...
I've wanted to lead
a lot of men
in a desperate battle.
Now I'm going to do it.
Look.
Battalion strength,
at least.
They haven't spotted
our positions yet.
They'll get an education
in about 10 seconds.
Wait'll they get a dose
of that artillery fire.
Commence firing.
Fire at will.
Commence firing.
Fire at will.
Commence firing.
Fire at will.
A hell of a waste
of fine infantry.
Get General Bradley
on the radio.
Yes, sir.
Sir,
I can't raise him.
Get over there, Dick. Tell them
to hit them hard on their right flank.
We'll hold them by the nose
and kick them in the ass. Go on!
Put him in my car.
Rommel...
you magnificent bastard,
I read your book!
Captain Richard N. Jenson
was a fine boy,
loyal, unselfish,
and efficient.
I am terribly sorry.
There are no coffins here
since there's no wood.
We will have a trumpeter
and an honor guard,
but we will not fire
the volleys,
as it would make people
think an air raid was on.
I enclosed a lock
of Dick's hair
in a letter
to his mother.
He was a fine man
and a fine officer,
and he had no vices.
I shall miss him a lot.
I can't see the reasons
such fine young men get killed.
There are so many battles
yet to fight.
Battle weary but victorious,
American G.I. S and Tommies
of the British 8th Army
meet in an Allied
victory celebration
at Wadi Akarit
in North Africa.
For the first time
in this war,
Broadway and Piccadilly
join hands.
Meanwhile, General Montgomery,
hero of El-Alamein,
continues to lead
his veteran
and victorious
British 8th Army
in a relentless drive
against Rommel's
vaunted Afrika Korps.
General Bradley's
done a tremendous job
with 2nd Corps.
He's moved
into Bizerte
and taken over
Good, very good.
You're not surprised,
are you, General?
After all,
you trained that outfit.
Uh, excuse me,
General.
Hmm?
Sir,
this is interesting.
We've discovered Rommel
wasn't present at El Guettar.
Who says so?
G-2, sir.
Are they telling me that
when we took on 10th Panzer,
Rommel was in Berlin
with an earache?
Severe nasal
diphtheria, sir.
G-2 also reports that Hitler
probably retained Rommel in Berlin
'cause things were going badly
for the Afrika Korps.
He didn't want his favorite general
to lose face.
Well,
I'm my favorite general.
I don't like some second-stringer
being up against me.
Then I lose face.
Who the hell
are you anyway?
General,
this is Lieutenant
Colonel Codman,
your new aide.
I pulled your name off the list
because I know your family.
I'm glad you did, sir.
Rommel is the best
the Krauts have.
I kicked the hell
out of him.
Now G-2 tells me
he wasn't even there.
But, General,
he undoubtedly planned
the German battle.
If you defeat
Rommel's plan,
you've defeated Rommel.
Isn't that true,
sir?
Codman.
- Have a drink with me tonight.
- Yes, sir.
I have a plan for
the invasion of Sicily.
I want to make sure
I get it approved.
You can help me.
I want to give a dinner
for General Alexander,
get to him before
Montgomery does.
This will be strictly
a formal affair,
but, uh, purely social.
By that, I mean,
um, purely political.
Yes, sir.
I want the finest food,
the best wine available,
everything
comme il faut.
Entendu,
mon Général.
Quelque chose
de vraiment spécial.
A va sans dire.
Qui aimeriez-vous
inviter?
Le Maréchal Alexander
et son Chef D'état-major,
peut-être Taylor.
Pas trop de monde,
plutot intime, d'accord?
D'accord, mon Général.
Oh, thank you.
George, this is
a really splendid wine.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I think it was Alcibiades
in the Peloponnesian War,
he said if Siracusa falls,
all Sicily falls,
and then Italy.
He knew, you see,
that Syracuse was
the jugular of the island,
and old Alcibiades always
went for the throat.
I propose to take Sicily
in the same way.
I think the old man
has them in his pocket.
According to my plan,
General Montgomery
will land here.
I'll hit the beaches
here, take Palermo.
Monty will drive north,
along the coast road.
I'll come due east,
take Messina,
and cut off
the German escape route.
Yes...
Well, it looks like
an interesting plan,
George.
Well, gentlemen,
to the conquest of Sicily.
To the conquest
of Sicily.
To Sicily!
George, you'd have made
a great marshal
for Napoleon
if you'd lived
in the eighteenth century.
Oh, but I did,
Sir Harold.
I did.
Morning.
Is General Smith in?
I believe he's
in the lavatory.
Thank you.
Ah. There you are,
Bedell.
Monty.
Bedell...
I've been giving
a good bit of thought
to the Sicily operation.
I, uh,
I assume we're alone.
You know,
Georgie Patton's
already discussed his plan
with Alexander.
I realize that,
but I have an idea
that his plan may lead
to an absolute disaster.
Oh?
Bedell, look.
This is Sicily.
Now, then,
according to
Patton's plan,
I would attack
Syracuse here,
and he would attack
Palermo up here.
Obviously, our forces
would be divided.
And, just as obviously,
they could be
chopped up piecemeal.
Now, then,
what I propose...
and what I shall insist on,
by the way...
is this.
I will land at Syracuse,
as planned.
The Americans...
the Americans
will land here at Gela.
I will advance
north to Messina,
the Americans
protecting my flank.
After all,
Messina is the key.
It's the reason
for invading Sicily.
I'll discuss your plan
with Ike.
I'm sure he'll give it
serious consideration.
- Amusing, isn't it?
- What?
That the final plans
for the invasion of Sicily
should have been put forward
in an Algerian lavatory.
George, I've bad news for you
about your Sicily plan.
Ike has turned it down.
He feels that
since the Italians
will be defending
their native soil
for the first time
and since the German
resistance is stiffening,
our forces
shouldn't be divided.
Where do my people land,
then?
In the Gulf of Gela.
What for? There's
only a beach there.
But it puts you
in a good position
to support Montgomery.
And, uh, where does
Montgomery land?
Well,
he'll land at Syracuse
and drive north to Catania,
possibly even Messina.
And you'll be alongside,
protecting his left.
I see.
In other words,
we get the burden again
while good old Monty
gets the glory.
Ike had to consider
all points of view.
He made his decision
not as an American
but as an Ally.
Had it been the
other way around,
I assure you,
Monty would protest.
You know, I've... been
in the army 30 years.
When I get an order,
I say, "Yes, sir,"
and I do my damnedest
to carry it out.
But...
this is what happens
when your commander
stops being an American
and starts...
being an Ally.
I haven't made
myself clear, sir.
Montgomery met tough
resistance at Catania.
However...
Perfectly clear.
Old Monty is as stuck
as a bug on flypaper.
But this order
from General Alexander
directs you to give up
the Baucina road
to Montgomery.
Then Bradley will have to
slug his way up the center
of the island
over those tough
mountain roads.
Yes, sir.
Messina, Bill.
Messina!
That's the heart
of it.
If they followed
my plan,
I'd have cut off
the retreat
of every goddamn German
on this island!
Know what I'll do?
First, go to Palermo,
then beat that limey
son of a bitch
if it's the last
thing I do!
What's all this talk
about taking
the Baucina road
away from 2nd Corps?
General Alexander's
orders.
The road goes
to Montgomery.
That road was
assigned to me.
How can I go north
without it?
I'm sorry, Brad,
but Monty's run into
tough opposition,
very tough.
Now, you wouldn't be
taking advantage
of this situation,
would you, George?
What are you
talking about?
Without that road,
your whole army
would be out of a job.
Free to enter Palermo.
I didn't say anything
about Palermo.
I can read a map.
Does Alexander know
you've pushed this far?
That's a reconnaissance
in force.
George,
I've got to slug it out
over those mountains
with heavy resistance
just so you can make
a bigger splash than Monty?
General, I just
follow my orders,
like the simple
old soldier I am.
General.
Sir, General Alexander's
heard we're moving west.
He says here,
"Stop immediately,
go no farther
than Agrigento.
Repeat,
stop immediately."
That's what you think
it says.
I think it was garbled
in transmission.
Ask them to retransmit
the message.
That will take
half a day.
Yes, sir.
Well, Brad...
where were we?
We were talking about
a simple... old soldier.
Look at that, gentlemen.
Compared to war,
all other forms
of human endeavor
shrink to insignificance.
Let's go, son.
Move out.
Give me that helmet.
Come on. Let's
get out of here.
What silly
son of a bitch
is in charge
of this operation?
I don't know,
but they ought
to hang him.
Good afternoon, Padre.
These gentlemen
are from the States
looking over our program for
the men's spiritual welfare.
We'll take you
into Palermo.
The colonel showed us
around your quarters,
and I saw a Bible
by your bed.
You actually find time
to read it?
I sure do.
Every goddamn day.
Sir, Patton's
taken Palermo.
Damn!
Palermo is history's
most conquered city.
First the Phoenicians,
the Romans,
the Carthaginians,
Byzantines,
then came the Arabs,
Spaniards, Neapolitans.
Now comes
the American army.
This is from
General Alexander, sir,
reminding you not
to take Palermo.
Send him a message.
Ask if he wants me
to give it back.
Let me ask you
a question.
You've come
from Washington.
How do they feel about
us taking Palermo?
The general impression is
your 7 th Army barreled
through token resistance
while Montgomery faced
the brunt of the fighting.
We took on the Hermann
Goering division,
toughest outfit
in the German army.
People are curious
about your pearl-handled
revolvers.
They're ivory.
Only a pimp from a cheap
New Orleans whorehouse
would carry
a pearl-handled pistol.
What about
your language?
It's loud and dirty.
That way they'll remember it.
What do your troops
feel about that?
I want them to fight
for me, not love me.
Ernie Pyle says you
have a secret weapon...
General Bradley,
the G.I. General.
That's what
Ernie calls him.
Omar Bradley's no secret.
He's a damn fine commander.
What's your feeling
about Montgomery?
He's the best general
the English have,
but he seems more concerned
with not losing than winning.
He's not
aggressive enough,
is that correct?
Boys, I've been getting
into trouble lately.
Yesterday,
the inspector general's office
told me my Italian prisoners
didn't have enough latrines.
Hell, they didn't know
what a damn latrine was
till I showed them.
If I've said anything
too critical
about my distinguished
British colleague,
let's just forget it.
I'll tell you one thing, though,
off the record.
I'm going to beat that...
gentleman to Messina.
Ah, Freddie.
This madman Patton's saying
he'll save our skins
by taking Messina.
This report might
interest you.
Here I am,
in these bloody marshes,
fighting malaria
as well as the Germans,
while he's taking Palermo
and getting all the glory.
Ah. Well.
Now he's up against
three good German divisions,
and he's stuck
for a change.
He's not going
to get Messina.
That's reserved for
the British 8th Army and me.
Time for a move,
Lucian.
Allen's first division's
bogged down east ofTorino.
You're bogged down
on the coast road.
We need another end run
to break things loose.
Ah. Lucian,
how's my fighter?
Fine, George.
Come in. Come in.
We need another one
of your amphibious
specialties.
Lucian,
I want you to send
a reinforced battalion
by sea
to land at Brolo
behind the Kraut lines.
General Bradley says
you want me
to tie this in
with a land-based
attack.
A coordinated attack
on the 11 th.
I don't think
that's possible.
It's only 15, 20 miles.
General, my boys
have been fighting
and dying for yards.
Well, kick a few butts
if you have to.
Lucian,
I recommended you
for your DSM
on your last promotion.
I know
what you can do
when you put your mind
to it.
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry,
but I can't do the impossible.
You're too old an athlete
to think you can postpone
a match already scheduled.
You know yourself matches
sometimes are postponed.
If we can't back
them up by land,
it could be
a disaster.
Those men might
get cut to pieces.
What's wrong
with you two?
All we're talking about
is not rushing in until we're ready.
- Give them an extra day.
- Just one more day.
The landing is on.
We're going to Messina.
We're going to get there
before Montgomery does.
What's so important
about that?
General Truscott,
if your conscience
will not permit you
to conduct
this operation,
I'll relieve you
and find somebody who can.
General,
it's your privilege
to relieve me
anytime you want to.
Well, this match
will not be postponed.
Do you have any questions?
No, sir.
You're a very good man,
Lucian.
You want to guard against
being too conservative.
Remember what
Frederick the Great said...
"L 'audace, I'audace,
toujours I'audace."
Go on. Have a drink.
Excuse me, sir.
I won't be drinking
for the next
couple of days.
If anything happens
to those men,
I'd like to be there
with them.
Well, you're not going,
so forget about it.
You believe
Truscott's right, huh?
No.
But I do know
you're gambling
with the lives
of those boys
just so you can beat
Montgomery into Messina.
If you succeed,
you're a big hero.
But if you don't,
what happens to them...
the ordinary
combat soldier?
He doesn't share in
your dreams of glory.
He's stuck here...
stuck living
day to day,
with death tugging
at his elbow.
There's
one big difference
between you and me,
George.
I do this job
because I've been
trained to do it.
You do it because...
you love it.
Those men on the beach
are catching hell.
Truscott's men
are doing their best,
but we have no
replacements for them.
We can't break through
to the coast.
I'm going down
there myself.
Colonel!
How in the hell did he
get over there?
What are you
waiting for?
Looking for a place
to ford, General.
I sent out a patrol
to reconnoiter.
I've already done that.
This sewer's
only 3 feet deep.
Get moving,
or you'll be out of a job.
And put
that helmet on!
Yes, sir!
Move it!
Let's go!
What's holding up
this column?
I don't know, sir.
Planes!
Come on!
Move it!
Pull up over there.
- What's going on here?
- It's these mules! Jackasses!
You let a column get stalled and strafed
because of jackasses?
What the hell's
the matter with you?
No. No.
Dump them over the side
and clear this bridge!
