Beat you to it, Sully.
- Got an alarm clock, lieutenant?
- Up here.
Capt. Rickson
could use an alarm clock.
Or dynamite, maybe.
Up, captain!
Grab your socks.
- You blast him out. I got work.
- I'll try.
Briefing's at 0500.
You got 20 minutes for breakfast.
Come on, sir.
Time to get up.
Briefing's at 0500.
You got 20 minutes for breakfast.
All right?
Buzz, come on.
Rise and shine.
Let go of that pillow!
That's my down-girl pillow.
You tell a girl, "Go ahead.
No, no, honey, not with your hands."
The minute she lays her head
down on that pillow...
- What time did you get in last night?
- Two, 3.
I don't remember.
But it was worth it.
I think.
Remember when we could
get up when we pleased?
A hot breakfast waiting for us.
Not have to go out before daylight.
Get shot at by a lot of guys
we don't know...
...and don't like their job
any better than we do.
The only trouble with this war is,
it begins too early in the morning.
- Bolland, you're out of clean socks.
- My apologies.
You need a personal maid.
If they didn't fence off those
WAFs, I'd have me one.
Save me flushing them
out of the woods every night.
Not supposed to fraternise
with the natives.
It's against rules and regulations.
Rules are for sergeants.
Come on, Buzz, will you?
- What's the hurry?
- We'll miss breakfast.
Bolland, sometimes
I worry about your love life.
Well, don't bother.
Remember, you're not in a
monastery. You're in the Air Force.
Thanks for reminding me.
Hey, come on, Buzz.
Will you hurry up?
Know what else you're gonna have
to learn before you're a good pilot?
How to relax.
- Hi, Marty.
- Greetings.
Morning, Lynch.
How's your dog?
How's Superman this morning?
Try and keep us on course
for a change, huh?
- There's a dance tonight.
- I'll have to call my girl.
- Where is she?
- Boston. Getting home from a dance.
- Where do you bet they send us today?
- Riviera for water sports.
Or Palm Springs to get a suntan.
Today's target, gentlemen, Kiel.
As you can see,
a short run across the North Sea.
Kiel is important because
of enemy submarine pens.
Here they are, in this inlet
just south of the harbour.
Hitting these pens will protect our supply
lines for Operation Torch in North Africa.
As group commander, Col. Emmet will
be in the lead ship of the lead squadron.
You will take your instructions
from him. Colonel.
Capt. Rickson will lead
the low squadron.
Capt. Woodman, the high.
Most of the flying will be
over water.
Don't get your hopes up
that this will be a nice milk run.
Reconnaissance reports a flak corridor
running through the target area.
And fighter attacks can be expected.
Stay together.
Keep your formations tight
and drop your bombs when I do.
And remember,
no broken field running.
This is a team effort.
Navigators and bombardiers
will remain for navigation briefing.
That's all, gentlemen.
Max, get the flak area.
Come on, Bolland.
- What's the hurry?
- 's waiting.
Well, figure it out for yourself.
- This is our seventh mission, right?
- Yeah.
We average three a week for the
next six weeks. That's 18, right?
- Well, 18 and seven is 25, right?
- Right.
We should be home in time
for the World Series.
- Farr, that's crazy figuring.
- How come?
Do you know the chances of all of us
coming through 25 missions alive?
- I mean, mathematically.
- Don't tell us. I hate math.
Hey, Prien, that medicine's rotgut.
Why don't you take that belly of yours
and have it operated on?
My stomach was all right
back home.
Why didn't you leave it there
instead of sticking us with it?
Hey, no one in the whole 8th Air Force
drives a car like Buzz.
It looks like a woman's sewing circle.
How's your stomach, Prien?
Okay, captain.
Any chance of an abort?
Mother Chicken is reading the
tea leaves. Bolland, check the cockpit.
- Max, check your bomb load.
- Right.
- What's all this?
- Overflow. Preflight okay, sir.
- Engine?
- All checked out.
I was losing manifold pressure on
number three. Check the blower?
You got a brand-new supercharger.
Oxygen?
Oxygen system's okay.
Full load, 450 pounds pressure.
- Gas?
- Tank's filled up to 2800 gallons.
Oil, all okay.
- What are we carrying, Max?
- Big stuff. Eight 1000-pounders.
Rickson will be pleased. He's got his
heart set on blowing up the Continent.
Hey, sir, captain?
Okay, Blackie.
Like me to stay behind,
look after the house?
You wanna live,
don't you, Junior?
Yeah. Yeah, that's the general idea.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
Number two.
Hit it.
Number one.
Number three.
Number four.
- Roger.
Roger. Rolling.
- Yeah, fine.
Zebra 3. Roger.
Gear up.
First time I went up on a plane,
I was 17. It was a dawn like this.
Dawns are for copilots, Bolland.
To all positions, all positions.
Test-fire guns.
There's something to look at, Bolland.
There's something to look at.
Save your ammo.
Save your ammo: And look, let's see
Number two. Tighten it up.
Number three, stay in close.
You're all by yourself out there.
Yes, sir. Joining the party.
We're at 11,000.
On oxygen, everybody. On oxygen.
Prien, check in.
- Okay, captain. Ready to check.
- Check.
- Okay, mine's on.
- Right.
- Brindt speaking. On oxygen.
- Farr speaking. Me too.
- Brag's okay.
- It's not working.
Sure, captain.
- Lynch, where are we?
Over the North Sea.
Could you be more specific?
I don't want advice, Lynch.
I want our position now.
We're approaching the coast, colonel.
What do you think?
- Looks like solid cloud cover. Chong?
- What are the chances?
- Not very good, sir.
We've lost contact. Probably
close to the IP, but I can't be sure.
I'll get a report
on the alternate targets.
This is Fat Gal Red.
This is Fat Gal Red.
Requesting operations report.
Zenith eight and nine.
Come in, Operations.
- All the targets are covered.
- Those weather guys missed it today.
Wanna try a chance shot
through the cloud cover?
No other military targets in this area.
We'll have to abort.
This is Fat Gal Red
to all padlocks.
Not my bombs.
- What about the solid cloud cover?
- We're going under it.
- What about Emmet?
- I'll handle Emmet.
Let's worry about the target, Bolland.
And listen, I want
as much speed as I can get.
Keep the bomb bays closed
until the last minute.
Attention, crew. Attention, all crew.
We're going in low. We're going in low.
I'm sorry, captain. I can't get on my
toes. There's not room enough.
Lynch, as soon as we get visibility,
set our course for the IP.
- What altitude do you figure on?
- About 9000.
Isn't that pretty low for bombing?
We'll be expected to...
Listen, Lynch, you navigate.
Let me do the flying.
Prien, they all tightened up
back there?
Here we go.
Altitude, 8500.
That was a pretty good guess.
- Warm up the automatic pilot.
- Right.
Lynch, have you picked up
the target course?
Hold her steady
on 038 degrees.
Right, 038 degrees.
Look what we've got here.
- Hand her over.
She's all yours.
There's your submarine pens.
Dead centre.
Bombs away!
Giving her back to you, Buzz.
I got it.
What about that? The squareheads
can't even shoot straight.
What were you saying?
That was pretty good.
Goodness has nothing to do with it.
Bandits, three 190s at two o'clock.
Handown, Bragliani,
they're coming in on your side.
Max, stay in the nose gun,
understand?
- Bandit, three o'clock level.
- Max, coming in, 11 o'clock high.
Junior, Prien, get him
when he passes underneath.
Everybody all right?
Just fine, lieutenant.
- The krauts never got in range.
- That's all right with me.
They must have hit Braddock.
His number-one engine's smoking.
He's trying to blow out the fire.
Why didn't he stay close to me?
Hey, what was all that junk
that went past us?
I knew you couldn't
get out of these crates.
Now you listen to me.
That's not gonna happen to us...
...not while I'm flying this bucket.
I'll be right there.
- Sick, or scared?
What's the difference?
Get us down.
Yes, sir.
All right, everybody.
Snap out of it.
- Or are you?
- My heart's still beating, captain.
All right, take over.
Yes, sir, we fell behind
on the turn.
Yes, sir, we fell behind
on the turn.
I used maximum power and
pulled up with the group.
- After you dropped your bombs.
- Yes, sir.
- What did you drop them on?
- The target, sir.
The target? With solid cloud cover?
Come on, Rickson.
We found a hole.
We had about six-tenths visibility.
- At what altitude?
- About 9000.
Eight thousand five hundred, sir.
- How's your hearing, Rickson?
- Very good, sir.
In fact, all your reactions
are good, aren't they?
You're about the hottest pilot
in the whole group.
Yes, sir. I guess I am.
Except for one thing. You're
insubordinate and irresponsible.
- Me?
- You heard my order...
...for the 180-degree turn, and you
deliberately abandoned formation.
It wasn't deliberate. We ran into a little
bit of heavy haze, and I lost contact.
And then you happened
to find yourself over the target.
It says in regulations
if a target of opportunity...
Don't tell me what it says in regulations.
This target didn't present itself.
You defied mission orders.
You went after it.
You went over a heavy flak corridor
at too low altitude...
...and risked every man
in your squadron.
I risk their lives every time
I take them off the ground.
Don't I, sir?
Anyway, we got through this one
all right. No one was hurt.
Except Braddock.
That was later, sir,
and it wasn't flak.
I'm sending Reconnaissance over to
photograph the submarine pens in Kiel.
And I think it'll show
that we clobbered them, sir.
It had better.
You may go.
One moment, Rickson.
Your navigator's Lt. Lynch,
I believe.
When you were lost in the haze,
why didn't he give you your bearings?
I guess you'd better ask him, sir.
You were gonna say
something, lieutenant?
No, sir.
That's all.
So I said to him,
"Let's go to London next leave."
I've done my dancing.
How about a little food?
Very good, Bolland.
Very, very good.
Excuse me.
Could you direct me
to the Eighth Avenue subway?
My name is Rickson.
What's yours?
Daphne Caldwell.
Daphne Caldwell,
Lt. Bolland.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
Bolland, you get the table.
I'll get the booze.
- Do you come from around here?
- No. I work in Cambridge.
- Hush-hush?
- Yes. A defence project.
- Would you like a cigarette?
- No, thank you. I don't smoke.
I'm a tourist.
Booked for 25 first-class missions.
Today was my seventh.
You're upset about something,
aren't you?
I was watching you
when you came in.
I had a date with a man named Pitt.
I've just been told he was
on a mission, didn't come back.
I'm sorry.
- There you go, Daphne.
- Thank you.
I never argue with luck...
...but what is a beautiful girl like you
doing running around by herself?
- My date didn't show up.
- He must be out of his mind.
Tell me, how do you like England?
The weather or the women?
- The weather.
- I think it's beautiful.
- Hi. Mind if I hijack the lady?
- Yes, I mind.
Thank you.
I'm not dancing tonight.
Some other time, maybe.
You really didn't answer
my question.
About England?
I'm having the time of my life.
There's only two things that mean
anything to me: Flying and women.
- In that order?
- In any order, or both together.
So you're enjoying the war?
- I like my work.
- Work?
Lady, I belong to the most destructive
group of men the world's ever known.
That's my work.
Hey, Buzz, look what
Reconnaissance just slipped me.
Wait till Mother Chicken sees this.
We clobbered them!
One, two, three, four, five, 10 direct
hits on the submarine pens at Kiel.
Those Germans ain't never
coming up for air.
Come on, fellas, come on.
We got them.
Come on, get up.
Get a bottle!
- Okay, come on, Buzz!
- Come on, Woodman!
You're all mine.
- Steady, John! Give me a bottle.
- Throw me a bottle. That's it.
Will you please take me to the bus?
There's one leaving at 12.
I'll be glad to.
I'd like to see you again.
I'm free Saturday afternoon
if you'd like to come to Cambridge.
I can't think of anything
I'd like better.
Good night.
Hey, Daphne!
Daphne! I don't know where you live.
- Hey, why'd you miss interrogation?
- I've got to get the bus to Cambridge.
I've got a date. If I can find her.
With the English girl?
Well, what do you know?
I'm telling you, Bolland,
she was giving me the eye.
- You got the eyes crossed.
- Don't worry. She's not my type.
- Too intellectual.
- Mail call.
I got it.
For you, Bolland.
Know what I'm gonna have to do?
Write me a letter and have 25 copies
sent to all my girls in the States.
I could get knocked off over here,
and nobody'd ever know.
When were you home last?
Home? You tell me where it is, Bolland.
I'll tell you how long ago it was.
It's from Daphne. She can meet me
at the quad of the King's College.
You two ought to have a ball
in that library with all those books.
Maybe I won't see you until tomorrow.
Sonny's growing up.
Staying overnight, huh?
Maybe. If the library stays open.
So long, Buzz.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Are you enjoying the madrigals?
- Is that what they are?
- Sixteenth-century pop tunes.
- You English are wonderful.
Half the world is blowing up, and you
go on singing music 400 years old.
You must think we're in a groove.
- Would you like to walk down to the river?
- You're the guide.
It's so wonderfully old.
Maybe Shakespeare and Ben Jonson
stood on this very bridge.
You're very American.
- Why?
- Well, romantic.
I like things that last.
Things last longer than people.
I wrote to Pitt's parents today.
Were you in love with him?
No. I didn't know him very well.
But he was a very nice man.
He was on Braddock's plane.
We saw it go down.
Your pilot, what's his name,
Rickson?
Buzz, yeah. Buzz Rickson.
Is he really that good?
They were making such a fuss over him.
- The best.
- Is he?
Yes. You see, well, I fly by the book...
...but Buzz flies like
he's a part of the plane.
Whenever we get into trouble, he knows
what to do without even thinking.
He's sort of your hero, isn't he?
I get sore at him once in a while.
We all do.
But we wouldn't trade him
for any other pilot.
I hope his luck holds out.
And yours.
Right now, my luck's doing fine.
It's started to rain again.
Shall we go somewhere until it stops?
- What about your lab?
- No, we can't. It's against the rules.
But we could wait in the library.
No, not the library.
It's just something that Buzz said.
Hey, Buzz, are you ready?
Get it over with, will you, captain?
Keep your pants on.
You're getting paid.
Not by the hour.
Ten bob if I miss.
A quid if you get hit, right?
- Don't even mention it.
- I never miss. Except once. I was drunk.
- What happened?
- We sent the quid to his mother...
...and gave the guy a decent burial.
That is true. He'll get it.
He's better than Davy Crockett.
- Now we'll do it with just the egg.
- Nothing do...
Come here, Junior.
Gee, thanks, Buzz. Come on,
I'll buy you boys a drink, eh?
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
Junior?
This is Junior Sailen.
He's the pilot of our fortress.
Hey, no, Buzz, not her.
What, this little chappie?
It's one of the smaller fortresses.
We've got them in all sizes.
Hey, come on over
and meet Junior's new girl.
- New girl? I haven't got a new girl.
- You've been holding out on us, Junior.
- What's your name?
- Hazel.
That's a very nice name.
It fits you like a glove.
You're pulling my leg.
You Yanks are all alike.
Real modest too.
Hazel, did you ever think of going
on a stage?
Definitely the home type, Junior.
You picked yourself a winner.
- Excuse me, I got work to do.
- Don't run out on your boyfriend now.
- Come on, Junior, get on the ball.
- Come on, Junior!
- I'm not a boy...
- Come on!
Let her go!
Since when did you start giving orders,
Lynch?
I'm not giving orders.
We're guests here.
And it would be nice if we started
acting like guests.
Look, sonny, you don't know
east from west.
Why don't you get out of here
and see if you can find your way home?
- It's an air raid.
- Well, come on, then.
- And leave the Yanks with the whiskey?
- They don't want to get killed either.
That's the Jerries, boys.
They're coming back again.
- There's a shelter down the road.
- Come on, Alf. Down the cellar.
Come on, Alf!
You coming, Buzz?
The hell with it.
Come on, Brindt, free liquor.
Cheers.
You know where I had my first drink,
Max?
When I was 13 and on the road.
One night, I got terribly hungry. I went up
to a farmhouse to get something to eat.
This woman invited me in.
She wasn't bad-looking either...
...except she was old enough
to be my mother.
She kept me there 72 hours.
Man, did I learn a thing or two.
The boy who came to dinner.
Buzz, we can get killed in this trap!
That's how I got my schooling, Max.
The hard way.
Not like Bolland and Lynch.
All they know about life...
...is what comes out of books.
Listen, you, when you've made a bomb
big enough to kill Rickson...
...come back and blow up the world!
They're bombing quite a way off now.
All right?
I'll never get used to air raids.
You've gone through some bad ones
in London, haven't you?
My father was killed in one.
He left the house one morning,
and that's the last we ever saw of him.
You must hate the Germans.
I hate war and everything about it...
...unlike your friend, Capt. Rickson.
I had a feeling that night at the dance
that you were running away from Buzz.
Perhaps I was.
Most women find him attractive.
He is, in a dangerous sort of way.
Why do we always end up talking
about Buzz?
You started it.
That's right, I did.
I was in love with a man like him once.
At least, I thought it was love
till I found out what he was like.
Don't look at me like that. You must
have had a girl back in the States.
I wasn't exactly in love with her.
Our parents were friends.
We grew up together.
We don't write anymore. She's
probably going out with somebody else.
Like you.
Daphne...
I even like to say that name.
Today on the mission, I kept saying it
over and over. Daphne.
That's the only air raid
I've ever enjoyed.
Good night.
I don't want to go back.
You don't have to.
What about your landlady?
Quiet.
Not very grand, is it?
You'd never make a good thief.
I don't suppose you're very hungry
after that dinner...
...but if you'd like a cup of tea,
it's no trouble for me to make.
Don't you think it's time you told
me your first name?
Ed. Most people call me Bo.
Bo. I like that. Bo.
Daphne...
Yes, I know.
Come on in, Zebra 1.
All clear for landing.
Roger. Zebra 1, clear for landing.
You look like you swallowed
those leaflets.
Emmet's stuck in my throat. Leaflets!
I'm here to drop bombs, not paper.
What's the difference?
We chalked up another mission.
Not quite.
Not quite.
Are you out of your mind?
Have Capt. Rickson report
to Operations right after interrogation.
No, wait. Send for his copilot instead,
Lt. Bolland.
And ask the flight surgeon
to be present.
I suppose if the window had been open,
Rickson would've flown you into the room.
- Well, I think he was a little upset, sir.
- Upset?
Well, you see, Capt. Rickson
didn't like the idea...
...of having to drop propaganda leaflets
on his mission instead of bombs.
You mean his little stunt
was a reprisal...
...for having to carry out an order
of which he disapproved?
I wouldn't exactly say that, sir.
What's your opinion of Capt. Rickson's
qualifications as a pilot?
The crew feels safe with him, colonel.
He's a great pilot. He's pulled us
out of some tight spots.
- Are you speaking for the entire crew?
- I believe so, sir.
What's your opinion
of Lt. Lynch?
I think he's one of the steadiest men
in the group. I'd trust him anywhere.
Apparently Capt. Rickson
doesn't agree with you.
He feels Lynch is on the verge
of a crackup.
- He's asked us to have him grounded.
- Rickson said that?
Yes.
Well, I think he's mistaken, sir.
You see, he and Capt. Rickson
aren't on very good terms.
We gathered that.
Lieutenant, we feel you're about ready
to command your own plane.
Would you like to be transferred from
Rickson's crew...
...while we put you through
some training?
- Are you giving me a choice, sir?
- Yes.
- I'll stay with my own present crew.
- And Capt. Rickson?
Yes, sir.
Well, that's all, lieutenant.
Well, what's your opinion, doc?
I'd be inclined to grant Rickson's request.
I know both men quite well.
He and Lynch have never hit it off.
We transfer Lt. Lynch
to Capt. Woodman.
Now, what about Rickson?
We never know what stunt he'll pull next.
- Can we afford to have that sort of pilot?
- Can we afford not to have him?
What's your opinion, doc?
Rickson's an example of the fine line that
separates the hero from the psychopath.
Which side of the line
do you place Rickson?
Time will tell.
I suppose we're running a risk...
...but then that's the nature of war.
Did you ever try to score
with a girl in the air?
No. But I tried it underwater once.
And I nearly drowned.
Louie Baker and I sneaked a plane out
one night.
We had two girls. Took them up, put on
the automatic pilot and... Whammo!
Six ball in the corner.
Hi, Bo.
Would've liked to have seen Emmet's
face when we buzzed his window.
Bet I don't go on any more paper raids.
Eh, Bolland?
Emmet's out to nail me. I can fly circles
around him, and he knows it.
Why did you tell him that stuff
about Lynch?
So that's why they wanted to see you.
Scratch.
Yeah.
Marty's the last guy to crack up,
and you know it.
I don't know it. Lynch is an amateur.
One amateur can kill nine professionals.
- He's a first-rate guy.
- All right, he's a first-rate guy.
- The graveyards are full of them.
- You don't like him.
That was just an excuse
to get rid of him.
Why don't you and your girlfriend
go curl up in a library...
...and let me run the crew, huh?
- Leave Daphne out of this.
- I have so far. Maybe I should move in.
- What makes you think you can?
- Want me to try?
That's up to you.
- It won't be the same without you, Marty.
- You got a stamp on you?
Don't worry about me, Bolland.
I'll miss the rest of you guys,
but as for Rickson, good riddance.
- I'd sooner have Woodman.
- I don't know.
It's the difference
between talent and genius.
- Buzz is cut out for this sort of thing.
- So are the Germans, for that matter.
Give Rickson a bomber or a machine gun,
and he could be on either side.
Pretty bad cold.
I forgot to wear my second pair of socks
on the Frankfurt mission.
- That a new picture of the kids?
- Yeah. Mom took it down by the cottage.
- How old are they now?
- John's 5 and Margie's 7.
How's it feel to be a married man?
Well, right now, mighty lonely.
I mean, it's a big responsibility,
marriage and kids.
Is that bad?
I don't know. I'm just asking.
How's that girl of yours?
- Daphne.
- Yeah, Daphne.
I see her whenever I can.
Sam...
- I don't think he's telling us everything.
- Don't jump to any conclusions.
Seven more missions,
and I'm on my way home.
See you, Marty. Take it easy.
Good luck.
Thanks.
- Where are you going?
- We're going out to eat, aren't we?
Are we?
Darling, I know it's not very romantic,
but I'm starving.
What shall I wear?
I like you this way.
That guy who was in love with you...
Which one?
Was there more than one?
Well, there's only one now, darling.
The one you said that was like Buzz.
Rusty Miller.
He was killed earlier in the war.
He was a paratrooper in North Africa.
Do you like my hair this way?
I like your hair, period.
It's hard to explain my feelings
about Buzz and Rusty.
It's almost as if they like fighting
more than the things they're fighting for.
You sound like Marty Lynch.
You and Marty are lucky.
You don't like what you do, but you think
something good will come out of it.
No, I don't believe all the things
they tell us.
All that propaganda and stuff
that you read in the magazines.
Keep the world safe
for the
I know you don't.
But you are on the side of life.
Is that enough?
It's enough for me.
Darling Bo, if we don't eat now,
we will die of starvation.
Can you see the name?
The House of Usher.
Woodman.
It's a wonder he's still in the air.
Must have been hit by cannon fire.
She's full of holes,
and her landing gear's shot away.
Belly landing.
Lynch?
Up front.
Come and see me later.
He'll be buried in the American cemetery
at Cambridge tomorrow. You'll get leave.
What about his wife?
She'll get the usual telegram
when the machinery grinds a bit.
I think she'd appreciate hearing
from you, though.
Take two of these tonight.
- No, thanks, doc.
- Sorry, Bo, that's an order.
Sleep is the only antidote we know.
In time, you can even work up
an immunity to death.
Does the world ever make you
want to throw up?
I consider war a complete negation
of rational behaviour.
Marty had a lot to live for, doc.
In that case, he was probably
more prepared to die than most of us.
- Is anyone ever ready to die?
- No, I guess not.
No healthy person anyway.
I'm sorry. I guess I was using a cliché
because I've nothing better to offer.
Bo, don't blame Rickson for this.
Rickson built up an image
of himself Lynch didn't buy.
He had to get Lynch out, or his hard shell
might have cracked wide open.
- Thanks, doc.
- Try and get some sleep.
We'll send the rest of his stuff
to his wife.
- Don't know what we'll do with the mutt.
- Come on, Sam.
We could teach him to bite
sergeants on sight.
Maybe throw in a couple of colonels
for good measure, huh?
Put down that dog.
You couldn't wait until he was buried
to get your hands on what you wanted.
Somebody's got to take care
of the mutt.
Not you. Put him down.
All right. He's down.
And don't touch any of Marty's things.
Bolland, you're behaving
like a sucking crybaby.
This is a man's racket we're in.
Men get killed flying airplanes in war.
If you hadn't dumped him,
he'd still be alive.
Watch yourself, Bolland.
You might be the next one I dump.
You think you're pretty tough, don't you?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I'll help you pack his things.
How near are we to London, Haverstraw?
About 043 degrees west, due in about
Late again. I'm gonna miss
the first act.
Bo, what are you and Daphne doing?
I don't mean the intimate details.
We haven't planned anything.
Maybe the Paris Club tomorrow night.
It's quite a joint. Full of free
French dames. And I mean free.
One of the four freedoms, parson.
After all...
...the French are our allies.
Yes. Yes, indeed.
They smell pretty good. Could I...?
Could I borrow one of those sandwiches?
Yes, of course.
When I get through
with this crummy war...
...I might just quit flying,
go into your business.
You mean, take holy orders?
I don't know about taking more orders,
but I'd like to sound off...
...at all those sergeants
down in the congregation.
I'd sure give them hellfire
and brimstone.
Well, I'm gonna go up
and talk to the pilot. Engine driver.
They have rules about passengers
riding on the engine.
I make my own rules, Max.
Nice talking to you, parson.
All right, men. Straighten up.
Straighten up.
Why waste a 48-hour pass
fooling around?
Set up a little game of stud poker
in London...
...then Junior and I'll have a stake
when we go home.
Only you just keep losing.
- Don't be a sucker, Junior.
- Don't give him your dough.
I got it already. You don't think
I'd let him have it, do you?
It's the same every leave.
We go flat broke
and can't afford any dames.
Dames, always dames.
- Junior, you can't put dames in a bank.
- That's not where I want to put them.
I think your brain is scrambled,
turning upside down in that ball turret.
- Well, the kid's making good sense to me.
- Scrambled? Me, scrambled?
Two kills and three probables.
And that's not counting the next one.
Lieutenant?
Got a hot rumour there's a big one
coming up on Leipzig.
- Think we're gonna get it?
- Haven't you read those posters?
Yeah. "Enemy ears are listening."
Forget it. Have fun in London.
And take good care of Junior.
Look, I guess Junior's sort of
adopted me, or me him.
I don't know which.
Anyway, that's why I tell him
I'm playing poker for a stake.
Me and Junior in business back home.
What a laugh.
What am I gonna do,
tell him the truth?
That we're both scared?
Playing poker helps me take
my mind off it, that's all.
We've all got that problem, haven't we?
Yeah, I guess you're right, lieutenant.
Anyway, there's only two more to go.
Hey, Buzz, cut it out will you?
- We don't want a Turkish bath!
- Hey, when did you join the union?
Hey, I knew it.
That hat looks good.
- Is this the only newsstand here?
- All the latest news.
- No, I'm supposed to meet someone here.
- There's three down here and one above.
- Darling, I have a surprise.
- What?
I borrowed my aunt's flat
for the weekend. We can be alone.
I love your aunt.
Hello, Yank.
You must be on the swing shift.
You're the live one, you are,
at this hour of the morning.
- How far's your place from here?
- Not more than 3 shillings by taxi.
- Cosy, comfortable, real homelike.
- I'll bet. Breakfast too?
Cup of strong tea
and a nice bit of toast.
That's for those who behaves themselves
and don't throw the furniture around.
- You look the sort.
- The sort of what?
- Gentleman's what I mean.
- Well, that's where you're wrong.
I'm the sort that throws
the furniture around.
I can see I'm wasting me time.
Five pounds. What's that for?
Buy yourself a dress.
And when you look in the mirror,
call yourself Daphne.
Daphne.
You Yanks!
- I'd like to set that clock back 48 hours.
- So would I, darling.
You don't have to remind me too.
Do me up, darling.
Did you used to come here
when you were a kid?
Every Friday night with auntie.
All very formal and proper.
- What would she say if she knew?
- Don't even mention it.
Hold still. This is a hard enough job.
You sound just like a husband.
I have an aunt that looks
something like her. Aunt Lila.
She has a big house
up on Narragansett.
- What did you do there?
- Loaf around.
We used to take girls out sailing.
We had a catboat. Dig for clams.
Would I like to have some
of those now!
- No fair. You know what that does to me.
- Well?
Do you ever wonder about us?
Your tour's nearly finished.
I want to get the war over
and done with.
That's as far as I let myself think.
What you're telling me
is, you're going back home soon.
Darling, we're together now...
...and it's all been wonderful.
Isn't that enough?
Yes, I suppose it is.
Then why are we getting so serious?
I'm sorry, darling. I didn't mean to.
I'll finish dressing and we'll go. No one
ever gets serious at the Paris Club.
Tonight, I love everyone:
The Polish, the French, the Norwegians,
the Dutch, the Danish.
- How about Americans?
- Especially Americans.
Bless them for Lend-Lease
and for lending me Bo.
Even if it is a short-term lease.
Could I have another drink, please?
I'll get it. It'll be easier.
- My friend's bringing me one.
- Until he comes.
But I'm robbing you.
Tonight, everything belongs to everyone.
To France.
And to our American friends.
- Hello.
- Hello.
You know, I had an idea
I'd find you here.
- Where's Bolland?
- Getting some drinks.
I don't blame him for keeping you
to himself.
Has that been too hard on you,
captain?
- Well, I never try to steal a friend's girl.
- That's very ethical of you.
At least until I get the all clear.
I don't think I follow you.
- Bolland's last mission is coming up.
- Yours too, I take it.
- I'm staying here as long as the war lasts.
- A patriot.
Nuts! I like it here.
You don't have trouble getting girls,
captain. Why me?
Why not? You sure put roses
in Bolland's cheeks.
And now you think I'll put roses
in yours?
Could be.
- Hi, Buzz.
- Hi.
Thank you, darling.
- I thought you'd be painting the town.
- We took in a few churches.
- Where's the rest of the gang?
- I don't know.
- I like to do my hunting alone.
- Hunting?
- Hunting.
- Supposing the game won't play?
It will.
You must keep your girls
stashed someplace.
Maybe he's saving himself
for a great love.
That's what women like to think.
Have you ever been in love, captain?
I'm serious. Have you?
In wartime, you don't fall in love.
You make love. You know what I mean?
That's all right for the men.
What about the women?
- It's train time. We'd better be moving.
- What's the hurry?
- I'm going to take Daphne home.
- I can get home by myself.
I'm taking you home.
You two act like
you're married already.
I think I want to go home.
I'll get you a cab.
Taxi!
- See you at the train.
- Sure.
- Fifty-two Bedford Place.
- Right, sir.
What is it, darling?
Is something wrong?
I hate endings.
I'm gonna see you on my next leave,
won't I?
One day soon there won't be any more
leaves. You'll be on your way back home.
We both knew that from the start.
That doesn't make it any easier.
No, please.
You didn't act this way
before Buzz appeared.
He has nothing to do with it.
I'm not so sure.
You said there was a side of you
Buzz appealed to.
Not the side that I admire.
It was no accident,
his coming over tonight.
He figured this was the right time
to move in.
Were your intentions so different?
Except he was more frank about his.
- You think my feelings are the same?
- Be honest, Bo.
All you wanted was a war girl,
that's all.
I probably got what I deserved.
- Wait for me. I've got a train to catch.
- Right, guv.
Bo, I didn't mean all I said.
You are different from Buzz, different
from anyone else in the whole world.
I've no right to blame you.
I just made a mistake, that's all.
I shouldn't have fallen in love
with you.
Goodbye, Bo.
- King's Cross Station.
- Right, guv.
Bloody war.
Aren't you supposed to be on your way
back to the base?
Well, there's always another train.
Nice place you've got here.
What I can see of it.
Nice.
Very, very ni...
Nice.
- No, thank you.
- Do you mind if I do?
You do pretty much as you like anyway.
- Don't you?
- Pretty much.
Incidentally, I like you in that outfit.
Cheers.
I also like the way you looked at me
at the club tonight.
Well, you were wrong.
- Where's Buzz?
- Isn't he here?
No, not yet.
Maybe he's driving.
As far as I'm concerned,
you're just another American pilot.
Not quite, honey.
What makes you so special?
I'm good.
That's what makes me special.
And
...is my body.
- Supposing  gets hit?
What are we doing, playing games?
Bolland's out, and I'm making my move.
It's as simple as that, is it?
Look, captain...
- It is late, and I'd like to go to bed.
- So would I.
Please. I want you to go.
You're pretty funny.
You send out little messages.
- When I answer them, you start running.
- I found you attractive.
- Is that what you want?
- No.
But you're getting warm.
I once knew a man like you.
Take and give nothing back.
Get wise, Daphne. The world
belongs to the takers.
And there's another saying:
"The meek shall inherit the Earth."
Sounds like Lynch.
You hated Lynch, didn't you?
- He saw through you.
- I didn't come here to talk about Lynch.
No, you didn't. You came to prove
you could take me away from Bo.
I have nothing against Bolland.
He just isn't meant for war.
No one could say that about you.
You love to drop bombs,
smash cities, kill.
- That's war.
- That's why you love it. Why you stay.
That's right. I'm gonna stay
until the last bomb's dropped.
And when the war's over, what then?
You can't keep the war going forever.
And when it's finished, you'll have
no place to go, and I know you're scared.
You can't make love. You're twisted.
You can only make hate.
I'm in love with Bo.
Do you hear that?
I'm in love with Bo.
We got a mission coming up.
Sure.
Why did you stay in London?
Had a date I couldn't break.
I hope it was worth it.
You ought to know, Bolland.
- Lf you think I don't know you're lying...
- Fifty-two Bedford Place.
Want me to describe the room?
French windows, picture of a dame
over the mantelpiece, nice, soft...
You hit pretty good, Bolland.
Keep it up.
Someday you'll be in my class.
If anything's happened to Daphne...
...l'll kill you.
What is this? You guys been up
all night or something?
Get that light out of my eyes, Sully.
Briefing's at 0400.
Ten-hut!
As you were.
Carry on with the briefing, major.
Yes, gentlemen, this is it.
The big one. The big L.
Leipzig.
Six hundred and seventy-five miles
into Germany.
Deeper than any bomber force
has gone before.
Leipzig is the enemy's largest
synthetic-oil refinery.
I don't have to tell you how important
this target is.
Knock out their oil supply, and we
destroy the power of the Luftwaffe.
When the day comes for Allied soldiers
to invade the continent of Europe...
...we want them to see
only friendly planes overhead.
If you are successful in this mission,
you may hasten that day...
...and the end of the war.
Screen.
All right, lieutenant.
This is a detail of the target area.
Once you're over Leipzig,
you'll have no trouble recognising it.
You'll ignore this down here on the left.
They're fake. Dummy buildings
to throw you off.
Here's the refinery up here on the right.
North of the refinery,
you'll see a hospital.
It's a good marker to guide you.
But only a marker, not a target.
Lights, please.
Col. Emmet.
I'm not going to minimise
the danger of this raid.
This could be the toughest mission
the 8th Air Force has flown.
The enemy is getting desperate. They've
been unable to break up our formations.
Lately, they've been coming in
for head-on attacks.
You can expect them to be doing that
today, hitting us with all they've got.
British Spitfires and our P-47 s
will cover us as far as Amsterdam.
From there on...
...we're on our own.
About six hours over enemy territory.
Now, one word of comfort.
You won't be lonely.
You'll be part of the largest bombing
force ever assembled.
One thousand heavy bombers.
Due to the sheer length of this mission,
you'll be subject to more interceptions.
There are no less than 80 fields within
strike distance of the bomber streams.
So remember, conserve your ammo.
No long bursts. Just short, well-timed
and sighted shots.
Navigators and bombardiers will
remain for navigation briefing.
The rest of you may go.
And good luck.
- Colonel, can I ask something?
- Yeah.
I know it's against regulations, but
it's important to me personally.
- What is it?
- Permission to put in a call to London.
Full security's on. I couldn't give myself
permission to contact anyone off base.
I'm sorry, Bolland.
- Haverstraw, where are we?
- Over the Dutch coast, near Amsterdam.
Handown, did Blackie say anything
about checking the hydraulic fluid?
- He was supposed to check it.
- He didn't say anything.
I forgot to ask him.
I meant to ask him.
The pressure was okay this morning.
I checked it on the preflight.
It was okay, huh?
- Junior, what's itching you down there?
- What do you mean, nothing?
- Farr, what's going on down there?
- Bandits!
About 20. Five o'clock high.
Holy crow, the sky's full of them!
- Coming in straight ahead.
- Nine o'clock, Farr. Get cracking!
What do you think I'm doing,
playing checkers?
- Hey, they got Perkins.
Captain, drop your right wing.
He's sitting on the right wing.
What's the matter? He was easy.
You didn't give us a chance.
Want to rest and let me take over
for a while?
Don't count me out yet, Bolland.
Somebody's lost his rabbit's foot.
I hope he doesn't need it.
Just north of Kassel, I'd say.
About 40 minutes to target.
A rough 40 minutes.
Feather number one. She's hit.
She's hit. Feather number one.
Haverstraw, how close to the IP?
Sixteen minutes. The lead squadron
should be over it now.
All right, Max. You ready to take over?
- We're 15 minutes away, sir.
The krauts must have cannons
or something. They're under the...
Ten of them at six o'clock.
Six more at six o'clock!
Three coming in at seven o'clock high.
They got Emmet!
You're group commander!
I'm hit.
- Nothing to worry about.
- I can use my other hand.
Take it easy.
Let me bandage you first.
How's Bragliani?
He got it on the hand,
but he can still shoot.
We're on the IP.
Five minutes to target.
- You ready to take over, Max?
- Okay. Anytime you say.
All right, Max, she's all yours.
Two minutes.
Heavy flak ahead.
Okay, Buzz, I'm giving her back to you.
Let's go home.
You've got it.
Handown, I have a red light.
Check the bomb bay doors.
Bomb bay doors are jammed open.
One bomb is still hung up.
What?! Buzz, keep her steady.
We got trouble in the bomb bay.
- Try to crank it down by hand.
- How about the bomb?
All right, Max, see if you can
get that fuse out.
Third Bomb Division.
Yes, this is Col. Vogt.
Good.
That's fine.
All right.
Just got a flash from the lead ship.
Target was hit at 1230 hours exactly.
- The fuse is set. I can't make it.
- We'll have to ride with it.
- And land with it.
- Here they come again.
- And land with it.
- Here they come again.
Four of them at 11 o'clock.
Mama mia,
Take Junior's place in the turret.
That's an order.
Brindt, take Farr's place at the gun.
You all right?
They got Junior.
His leg. I don't think
he's gonna make it.
Take over.
How is he?
You want to take her?
We're losing altitude.
Buzz, we're losing altitude,
And number three is cutting out.
Haverstraw, where are we?
About 40 minutes to base
at the present speed.
We're losing 50 feet a minute.
How does that figure?
- Looks like we'll run a little short of air.
- He's right. We can't make it to base.
We'll make it.
Buzz, the brakes are out.
There's a bomb in the bomb bay.
We can't ditch in the water.
The bomb would go off.
I said, we'll make it.
We're over the channel.
The guys are wondering, if we're gonna
jump, oughtn't we call Air-Sea Rescue?
I'm still giving the orders,
Haverstraw.
We're under 1500 feet.
If we get to shore, we won't have
enough air to clear the cliffs.
I'm gonna bring this crate in.
I'll show them.
You'll show them?
That's all you ever think about.
The men on this plane are not gonna
give up their lives to make you a hero.
Afraid to die, Bolland?
You're damned right I am.
But you're scared to live.
Make the call, Bolland.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Calling Air-Sea Rescue.
Calling Air-Sea Rescue.
This is Zebra 1. Zebra 1.
Come in, Air-Sea Rescue. Come in.
Haverstraw, give our position.
Mayday, mayday, this is Zebra 1.
Our position as follows...
Prien's had it. Dump the heavy stuff
overboard. Everything that's loose.
- Suppose the krauts hit us now?
- Don't even mention it.
About Daphne. She beat me, Bolland.
Beat me right to the ground.
Only woman that ever did.
You think the meek
are gonna inherit the Earth?
How would I know?
Well, if they do...
...count me out.
There's your boat.
We're under 600.
That's figuring it pretty close.
I'll get the others out.
We're over the launch.
Jump close together. Brag, you're last.
Remember, we're close to the water.
Pull the cord as soon as you're clear.
Go.
Buzz, time to jump.
Put her on automatic.
Where's your chute?
All right, baby, we're alone now.
We're gonna make it.
Do you hear me?
We're gonna make it.
Get me up.
Get me up.
Come on.
Get me up.
He wouldn't get off the plane.
It's what he always wanted.
Darling, I'm so glad you're here.
