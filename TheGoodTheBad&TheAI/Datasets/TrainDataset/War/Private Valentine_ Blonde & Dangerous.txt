Miss Valentine.
Miss Valentine.
It's time to get up.
Good morning,
Camille.
Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo,
peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo!
You like?
I like.
I don't know.
Oh! You like.
I like.
Those.
I'm not sure
if those are comped.
Where should they bill?
Delores?
Yes? Coming.
Yes. Right here.
Delores will give
you all of
Cousin Barry's info.
He's the one that
handles all my money.
SALES GIRL: Okay.
Your jewelry for
tonight has arrived.
Hey, Peek-a-boo!
Don't chew on
those Jimmy Choos.
How cute is that?
Okay, so I'm thinking
old Hollywood,
I saw a clip of the
movie. So adorable.
The layers you
brought to that
character? So deep.
Really?
Megan. Come on,
we're friends.
Look at me.
Would I lie to you?
Megan? Don't freak, okay?
Joe Kidd strikes again.
That dirt bag.
I was walking past
the doctor's office,
not out of it.
That's a good
picture of you.
I know, right?
Wow! Don't you look nice?
That dress would be perfect
if we were premiering a movie
called
That whole thing
to me says,
"I've got five different
kind of pills in me and
I don't wear panties."
And that hair looks
like you plucked it
off of a blow-up doll.
We talked about this.
I specifically
remember
because your
New Jersey screech
makes my ears bleed.
Now, get out of here,
Catwoman, and take
your friends with you.
All right. I'm sorry
I had to be a little
rough with your handlers,
but that's what
a good manager does.
He manages.
Don't give
me that pout.
How long have we
been together now?
Since I was 13.
And have I ever
steered you wrong?
When you told me my
period was the devil's
way of saying hi.
I don't exactly think
menstruation is a gift
from a loving God.
I have known you
ever since you were
little Frances Bagley,
that fat girl who
did the tap dance
at the indoor swap meet.
I remember seeing
you and thinking,
"Sure, she's got mousy
brown hair and a snaggle
tooth and an oily forehead.
"But we can do
something with her."
We have made you
America's Sweetheart
and we're not gonna
stray from that path.
Can we stray
from talking
animal movies?
Megan, all
the greats have done
talking animal movies.
You've got
Clint Eastwood in
Meryl Streep,
Just yesterday,
you were named
Best Actress
by the inmates
at Leavenworth Penitentiary.
That's a huge deal.
It's a very big prison.
You know who was
the runner-up?
Judi Dench.
Here's the dress. This
is America's Sweetheart.
This is Megan Valentine.
Cousin Barry!
Thank you so much
for the flowers.
I cannot believe it.
It is like looking
in the mirror.
I mean, we're like
identical cousins.
You know, I mean,
if I bleached my hair
and had a big comb-over.
I mean,
I've worn a bustier
a couple of times.
It's very similar.
Good Lord.
We're both wearing thongs.
Derek!
- Baby!
Gosh, what a surprise.
I thought you
couldn't make it.
Oh! I had to be
here to support you
on your big night.
Besides, Nigel
pulled some strings
and he promised the director
he'd have me back in time
for tomorrow's shoot.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Aw!
All right.
Ooh! I'll let
you get that.
Hey, Sidney.
Hey, kiddo.
How's it going?
Hey. Tell Brad
I'll call him back.
Hey, I wanted to talk to
you about that script that
you sent over the other day?
Barbra Streisand biopic?
They're looking for
somebody a little bit
more serious, you know?
But, Sidney, that's...
People love you
the way you are.
You're cute.
You're perky.
You've got D cups.
You're America's Sweetheart.
listen to your agent.
I know what you want, okay?
I'll see you at the
after-party. We'll talk.
How's anyone gonna
ever take me seriously
when I can't get
a serious role
to begin with?
Where's my
Where's my
Hey. This guy takes
you seriously.
All right?
You're gonna do great.
You're so pretty. Yeah.
You look great. Go, go.
You look good. Go.
REPORTER 1: Meg! Megan!
Megan, is it true
you two are engaged?
REPORTER 2: Megan, what
about the pregnancy rumor?
Hey, Derek, are you
sure you're the dad?
It might not be you.
I hate that Joe Kidd
guy. I love you!
All right.
Back off, fatty.
What? It's my job.
- I've had enough of you.
I don't care if
you do your job.
- Let me see your veneers.
These are worth nothing.
Now, Derek, you have
to admit your career
has taken off
since you and Megan
started dating.
Well, there it is,
ladies and gentlemen.
True love alive in Hollywood.
Babe, it really looks
like you're hiding there.
I know, right?
- It's amazing.
Yeah.
It's not fair.
You just got here.
I know.
Look, we'll take
a trip when I get
back, all right?
Just the two of us.
I'll pay half.
I'm sorry I couldn't
stay to the end.
I'm just glad
I got to see you shine.
You were amazing tonight.
I love you.
- I know.
Okay, I got to go.
Nigel will be all over me
if I'm not on that plane.
All right. Okay.
Excuse me.
Okay.
Bye. Bye.
WOMAN: Okay, that was
torture. Ten minutes in
and my mind went numb.
How do you stand
hanging out with her?
I have to. It's
part of the job.
I better get
back out there.
Time to kiss some ass.
Sidney?
Am I... I am
sitting down.
Keep drinking.
It gets worse.
Cousin Barry? It's not
possible. He just sent
me flowers this morning.
More like you sent
yourself flowers.
We just got the bill.
He's been siphoning off
money from you for years.
You didn't notice?
No, I didn't notice.
I don't handle the money.
Barry handles the money.
Well, Barry's gone now.
So is about $15 million
of your money.
I have $15 million?
Had. Had $15 million.
$15,700,000, to be exact.
Does Nigel know?
We can't get a hold of him.
He must have his cell off
for the premiere.
Meggie, Barry cashed out
all your investments.
I don't even know if
you can keep the house.
I guess I can just
stay in the guest house.
That's part of
the house, kitten.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry.
He really cleaned you
out. You're broke.
Nigel, pick up the phone.
Where the hell are you?
I've been trying to
call you all night.
Hello?
Hey, Jinny.
It's Megan.
Megan. It's after
midnight here.
I just really wanted
to hear your voice.
I haven't heard
from you in months
and out of the blue
you call me in the
middle of the night?
Nigel?
Nigel!
Nigel, where have you been?
I have been calling you...
Nigel?
Derek?
- Hey.
Megan! Wait!
Just, come on.
Hey, it's not what
I think you know it is.
Baby! Megan!
Megan.
Why?
Nigel said being with
you would help out my
career. I'm sorry.
Come on. Friends? Meggers.
It was a character study.
You were great tonight!
God?
Hi, Mr. Start.
No. My boyfriend's gay!
Well, of course
I've been hurt.
He told me
that he loved me.
And I don't even
have a house anymore.
I don't know what
I did to deserve
this, Mr. Start.
I'm a really good
person. I give to
charity...
I think.
This is not good.
I gotta go.
Um...
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but
you can't sleep here.
Can I use your bathroom?
I promise I'm not homeless.
Well, actually,
I am homeless.
But I really got to
go to the bathroom.
Of course, ma'am.
I bet that gives you
really good glutes.
Cute outfit.
Thank you.
- Yeah.
Or be what everybody
else wants you to be.
Having some
troubles, ma'am?
I have no control
over my life.
Well, maybe you need
to step away from it.
Get some perspective.
You're right.
Yeah, you need to see
what you're made of.
You're right.
I need that.
Being a soldier
isn't a walk down the
red carpet, ma'am.
You can't just decide...
Don't tell me
what to do.
Please. Not you, too.
I really need this.
I have a contract right
here, Miss Valentine.
Are you telling me a Hollywood
actress really wants to join
the United States Army?
Yeah.
Are you ready to embrace
the core values that the
Army holds dear?
Loyalty, duty, respect,
honor, integrity and courage?
It's like you're
totally reading
my mind.
Are you ready
to take an oath
and become a member of
the United States Army?
Yes.
Are you ready to
be Army strong?
Yes, sir!
I think the girl
next to me is dead.
What?
I think the girl
next to me is dead.
She looks a lot
like Megan Valentine.
That girl from the
talking dog movie?
She should be dead.
Am I in coach?
Am I in coach?
Oh, my God.
It is Megan Valentine.
Why are you looking
at me like that?
I'm from a trailer park
in Missouri. The only
celebrity I've ever met was
when Ronald McDonald
showed up at the mall.
You're freaking me out.
Will you sign my face?
Um... What the hell
are you doing here?
What, are you researching
a role or something?
No.
JOHNSON: So you're
actually telling us
that you joined the Army?
Wow! You must have had
one messed up night.
God, I miss those.
Recruits.
Army Senior Drill Sarge,
Sergeant Mills Evans.
You've arrived at Fort
Jackson. You will not
speak unless spoken to.
You will obey
each word I say.
When I say go,
you will exit
and immediately place
your feet on the yellow
footprint formation.
Go, go, go, go!
Move, move, move, move!
Get your bags and go.
Move, move, move, move!
Come on!
EVANS: You forget something
for a dance tonight?
Get off my bus.
Move, move!
Okay. Okay.
- Get off my bus.
Let's go! Move it!
Princess Buttercup.
Move your feet.
Move your feet, Petunia.
Hey, say it,
don't spray it.
Move, move, move.
Move those feet.
Move, move, move!
Yes.
You better get
your S-H-I-T
consolidated ASAP
or you will be SOL PDQ.
Do you understand me?
No. I have no idea
what he just said.
SOLDIER 1: This is
not a slumber party.
Get your game face on!
This is so not my vibe.
What happened to, like,
the cute little rock climbing
outfits and the sisterhood?
You will stand at attention!
Put your bag down!
Shoulders back!
Eyes front!
SOLDIER 2: Look at me!
Now, when I address you,
your response to me will
be, "Yes, Drill Sergeant."
Do you understand?
Why didn't you tell me
my mascara was running?
Now say it like
you got a pair.
ALL: Yes, Drill Sergeant.
Here. This will
take the edge off.
What do you think this
is, a rehab facility?
I don't do drugs!
My body's a temple!
Did you think that bus
was going to a Phish
concert? Put that away!
Now, listen up.
This is your First
Sergeant, Louisa Morley.
She'll be overseeing
your training here
at Fort Jackson.
You will address
her as First Sergeant.
Certainly have hit a new low,
haven't we, Sergeant Evans?
Yes, First Sergeant.
Name, soldier.
Jeter, First Sergeant.
Don't I know you?
Proudly served
as sergeant at
Fort Benning.
Traded my stripes
in for marriage.
That fell through.
Came back for the
love of my country,
First Sergeant!
A woman scorned is
a good soldier.
Welcome back,
Private Jeter.
What's your name?
Ma'am, Petrovich, ma'am.
"Ma'am"? I worked hard
for my rank, Private.
You will address me
as First Sergeant.
Are we clear?
Yes, First Sergeant.
Are you about to cry?
Ain't no crying in
the Army, baby girl.
'Cause I ain't got time
to be changing no diapers.
Are we clear?
Yes, First Sergeant.
Oh!
Did I just catch you
eyeballing me?
No, First Sergeant.
Am I attractive to you?
'Cause I'll only break
your heart, sweetheart.
Name, soldier.
Private Castillo,
First Sergeant.
What are you?
Huh? You some kind
of gangbanger?
What you gonna do?
What, you gonna
cut me, mommy?
Is that what you gonna do?
You gonna cut me?
No, First Sergeant.
I got my eye on
you, Casti-ho.
This is the
United States Army.
We will tolerate
nothing but...
Excuse me? Excuse me? Hi.
This is really embarrassing.
Sorry to interrupt,
but I'm Megan Valentine.
Mmm-hmm.
The actress?
Hey.
See, this really isn't
what I was picturing
when the recruitery
guy was telling me
about me finding myself.
Really? Well,
come on over here a
second, sweetheart.
But first, who
are you wearing?
Dolce and Gabbana.
Ah!
Stunning. Stunning.
Thanks.
It looks like we've got
ourself a special visitor
today. Megan Valentine.
Why don't we all
give her a round of
applause? Come on!
Come on.
No, you all can do
better than that.
Let's hear it for
Megan Valentine.
Hi.
Let's hear it for Megan.
She's just pretty as a peach.
Thank you.
Between us girls,
I need a bath,
a phone and, like,
Do you know any cute,
like, B and B's around here?
Let me think.
Bed and breakfast?
Yeah.
Nearby. And you'll probably
need a ride too, huh?
You're a doll.
Well, then
by all means,
let me ride you,
Miss Daisy.
Drop and give me 10.
Ten what?
Ten push-ups.
Drop and give me 10!
Will you hold
my bag? Thanks.
I think I wanna take
the scenic route, Evans.
My grandmother can
do a better push-up
than that.
Off your knees. This isn't
the Girl Scouts! Now, down.
I said, feet back. Down!
I'm trying.
Up! Down.
Up. Down. Hold it
when I say down.
Down. Up. Down. Up.
Down. Up. Down. Up.
Down. Up. Down. Up.
Get up, Hollywood!
Get up!
Okay.
As you can see,
I'm a huge fan.
Really, I am.
But we just seem to have
a teeny weeny problem here.
You see right here?
Like the VIP, girlfriend,
you on the list.
So as long as your
name is on my list,
you're not going anywhere.
Fall in for processing.
There you go, cuteness.
Sidney, it's me.
I made a mistake.
I need your help.
I crashed my car and now
I'm at the Army and
everyone's yelling at me.
Come on, you know
how much that tube
of eye cream goes for?
No, not the Libra.
I have been on
a waiting list.
These are on loan.
One size fits all?
Am I being
C-D-N-K...
Oh!
That's so wrong.
I don't wear
underwear.
When is this gonna end?
This is just the beginning!
Gosh. Where's my room?
These sheets better have
a decent thread count.
Can you believe that?
She just sees a tattoo
and just assumes I'm
in a gang or something.
I hate that I let her
make me cry.
Thank God.
Attention, ladies.
It's 5:00 a.m. Time
to fall in for duty.
Let's go. Let's go.
Rise and shine, ladies.
Move it, move it, move it!
Let's go.
Private Valentine?
Move it, Hollywood.
WOMAN: # I wanna be
an airborne ranger
ALL: # I wanna be
airborne ranger
# Living on blood
and guts and danger
# Living on blood
and guts and danger
# I wanna be an
airborne ranger
# I wanna be an
airborne ranger
# Living on blood
and guts and danger
# Living on blood
and guts and danger #
I think I'm gonna die.
I want my mommy.
Weren't you just
on the cover of some
fitness magazine?
Yeah. I don't work out.
I have a high metabolism.
What? You look
like that without
working out?
It's really hard
for me to gain weight.
Yeah, whatever.
Before I cry you a river,
tell me, why are you
really here, Valentine?
I needed to get
away from my life
for a little bit.
And that recruiter
was so hot.
And his voice
was so soothing.
I made a mistake.
Let's go, soldiers!
Move, move, move, move!
My grandmother runs
faster than that.
Who's your grandma,
Derek Jeter?
Private, you had better
pull it together fast
or you are never gonna
make it through this.
That's just it. I don't
wanna make it through.
I changed my mind.
It was an impulse purchase.
Well, you bought yourself
quite a challenge.
SOLDIER: Move it!
Come on, get over here!
Sidney!
She crashed her car
and went to Armani?
Why would anyone
yell at her at Armani?
I had the operator
trace the call. It came
from a Fort Jackson.
The Army base?
These Army guys,
I know how to handle them.
And their intimidation
tactics.
This, all for looks.
Sit.
Gentlemen, we've
located your girl.
Oh! I'm just glad
we found her.
"Major movie star missing."
Try explaining that one.
Sidney?
Oh, my God!
What did you people
do to my star?
Honey, what happened?
You gave her a gun?
It's not loaded, is it?
There was gunfire
and mud and running.
She hates running.
They tried to kill me.
Who?
Who, sweetheart?
Who tried to kill you?
The ones in the camouflage.
Well, that's it. Let's go.
We're getting you out of here.
She signed a binding
US Government contract,
gentlemen.
She was in a car accident.
She was in shock.
Post-traumatic stress.
She had a concussion.
What he said,
I was concussed.
Sir, it is my opinion
that Private Valentine
does not belong here.
Come on.
She's an actress.
She's insecure,
yet full of herself.
That's what makes her
so impressionable.
If she had walked
into a circus tent,
she'd be in a leotard,
juggling poodles right now.
She did not walk
into a circus tent,
Mr. Green.
She walked into an
Army recruiting office.
I don't care who she is.
Megan Valentine is
now property of the
United States Army.
All right.
Well, let's do this.
Name your price.
MPs? Remove this
George Hamilton wannabe.
What's happening? Sidney!
SIDNEY: I'll be
back for you.
Meanwhile,
work on your abs!
Don't leave me here!
I don't belong
with these people.
They're from trailer parks and
gangs and they all ride coach.
I will never survive.
My roots are already
growing in.
I'm going.
No, no...
MORRIS: Don't you hurt me.
Worm.
- I'm an attorney.
I'm staying?
Sir, she is not fit
to be a soldier.
Her very presence
is a distraction.
Enlistment is
down, Sergeant.
We cannot
afford to have a
celebrity go AWOL
and trash the Army
all over the press.
For now, she stays.
Big Mo, you come.
Sir.
Move out, Valentine.
Move out!
Okay, okay.
- Move!
Keep going. Don't stop
till you get over there.
EVANS: Let's go, Valentine.
Get over the obstacle.
Let's go. This is easy.
I did it again.
Get up there.
Get up there
and do it again.
So I said it's like
pulling keys out of
a monkey's ass.
Don't even think about it.
Thanks. That Jeter's
a hug waiting to happen.
You put soy sauce
on eggs, too?
Yeah, it's the Japanese
ketchup. Right?
Pretty much.
Hamamori, this is
Megan Valentine.
I'm sure you've seen
some of her movies.
Just on an airplane,
but yes.
Well, I've seen all
your movies. In the
theater. Twice.
Thanks.
So, you're an actress.
That must be fun.
Everybody in
my family's in
the military.
Is that what you wanna do?
- Oh, no.
I wanna grow
medical marijuana
to help people.
Taking some of
the power away from
the drug companies,
all the while reducing
my own personal
carbon emissions.
Sounds like a plan.
I like to help, too.
I give to charity.
Good for you.
Aren't you
dating Derek O'Grady,
that Greenpeace guy?
We broke up.
- That blows.
What happened?
I don't know.
Last thing he said
was, if he didn't
make his plane,
my manager would
be all over him.
Guess he didn't
make his plane.
Today Sergeant Evans
will instruct you on
how to fire your rifle.
What's the first rule
we've learned?
ALL: Never be without
your rifle, First Sergeant.
What is it?
ALL:  Never
be without your rifle,
First Sergeant.
Private Valentine,
where is your rifle?
Uh...
Rifle said he needed
time apart. It wasn't me.
He just needed his space.
Sergeant Evans,
run the platoon three
miles back to the mess
to retrieve
Valentine's rifle.
EVANS: Yes, First Sergeant.
Now, fall out.
Give me a formation!
Sorry. Normally I have
an assistant to take
care of stuff like that.
Give me a break.
I swear, Valentine,
when we find your rifle, I'm
gonna staple it to your head.
Halt! Halt! Halt!
What now, Valentine?
I really... I really
have to go. Number...
Oh!
I see.
Valentine needs
to lay some cable.
And probably gonna need
a little tissue, too, right?
Thank you.
Well, you just go
right over there.
Take your sweet little time, okay?
- Okay.
We'll be right
here waiting.
Okay, okay.
Valentine?
When you get back,
three more miles for
everyone.
Go. Go.
Two steps forward.
Right foot crosses
behind the left.
Sit down. Aim. Fire.
Now, lock and load.
Sorry.
You could be court-martialed
for that, Private. Get up!
Off my firing platform.
- Sorry.
MORLEY: Come on now.
I ain't got all day.
Move it, move it, move it.
Come on, Hollywood.
Disgraceful. Lazy bum.
Please. Somebody
call my stunt double.
She lives for this stuff.
MORLEY: Hollywood!
You just earned
three miles for everyone.
Valentine, I don't wanna
feed into stereotypes,
but I don't swim, and
this is more water than
I can drink, so move it.
Jeter, show them
how it's done.
No problem,
First Sergeant.
MAN 1: All right.
MAN 2: Come on, Jeter.
Come on, Jeter.
JOHNSON: Oh, my God.
Who's a hero?
Who's a hero?
Oh, my God.
Why did you do that?
A mosquito was piercing
through your helmet.
You should be
thanking me.
Well, thank you, bitch.
No!
All right, Private.
Who you leaving now, asshole?
Who you leaving now?
He's dead, Jeter.
- Who're you...
He's dead.
EVANS: Let's see what
you've got, Valentine.
I'm sorry.
What's my motivation?
That's it. That's it.
What... What are you doing,
Valentine? Are you trying
to force a discharge?
Ew! No.
Drop and give me 20.
Everybody! Right now!
What? Now everyone
here hates me?
That's just it, Valentine.
There's 30 of us
here and all we keep
hearing about is you.
It's not only about you.
JETER: Valentine.
What?
Listen up, poopy-pants.
Oh! This is
gonna be good.
Now, I don't give
a shit who you are
or why you're here.
But I gave up my rank
as sergeant to make the
worst mistake of my life.
So I'm here to get
my stripes back.
But if I have to run one
more extra mile or do one
more extra push-up,
because your lazy,
pampered ass
can't keep up,
you're gonna have
to answer to these.
Look at this.
Look at this bed.
See this?
We're all gonna end up
paying for that.
Because Miss
"I Wish I Was Glenn Close"
can't make her bed.
Well, tonight, when
you're sleeping in those
steel wool linens,
keep one eye open.
Huh! Huh!
I'm sorry, okay?
I told you guys,
I don't wanna be here.
You know what? Save it.
Meanie.
Come on, last turn.
Twenty-four.
- Twenty-five.
Twenty-six.
- Twenty-seven.
Valentine!
What?
# I see the air force
looking at me
ALL: # I see the air force
looking at me #
I told you guys,
I am not a soldier.
I'm an actress.
I am America's Sweetheart.
Right now
you're America's
pain in the ass.
Valentine. Valentine!
Are you all right?
Thank you, Sergeant.
Hey, that whole yelling
thing, that's just a part
of the job, right?
I mean, you're
not like that at home
or anything, are you?
I don't do heights.
Yeah, okay, if I'm gonna
be up that high, I'm gonna
need to be on something.
Where's Hamamori?
Hey. Medicinal purposes.
Okay, guys, this is fine.
We just take step by
step. Level by level.
We can do this.
We can work as a team.
The point is to get
to the top, not to talk
around the bottom.
Let's go, Valentine. Move!
JETER: All right,
let's go, princess.
Get there. Good job. Whoa!
Valentine. I swear...
I swear to God.
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay.
That was fun.
Yeah, for you.
Your ass was in my face.
Disgraceful, Castillo.
I so wish I was in a gang
right now so I could...
I could shank her.
There's something about her
that's so familiar to me.
My heart is beating
outside my chest.
Castillo, you're the doctor.
Put it back in.
You're a doctor?
Are you talking to me?
Is she talking to me?
Castillo.
No, no, no. She can't
afford medical school.
That's why she's here.
Military's gonna
help her pay.
So is that why you're
here, Petrovich?
To go to college?
No. My brother Paul died
serving in Afghanistan.
I'm here for him.
I wanna make him proud.
I did that?
Platoon! What is the
most important rule
of field combat?
ALL: Never be without
your rifle, First Sergeant!
What is it?
ALL: Never be without
your rifle, First Sergeant!
Hollywood!
MORLEY: I will never
be without my rifle.
ALL: I will never
be without my rifle.
You will what?
ALL: I will never
be without my rifle.
I can't hear you.
ALL: I will never
be without my rifle.
Little bit louder.
ALL: I will never
be without my rifle.
There you go.
I can't. I can't...
You're a disgrace,
Valentine. Get up!
You mark my words.
You will let these
people down.
Private Valentine,
you're dismissed.
Move out!
You will all do 10 more
minutes to make up for
Valentine's failure.
Can I ask
you something,
Valentine?
If you promise
not to yell it.
You have the kind of
success that other people
can only dream about.
But you approach everything
you do like you're gonna fail.
I don't get that.
I'm not you and I'm
not your grandmother.
It's just a
figure of speech.
My grandmother lives
in a retirement
home down in Florida.
Oh!
And the truth is
I almost didn't
make it through Basic.
When your dad's a General,
you stick out a little.
Actually, a lot.
It becomes a sport. Who can
break the General's kid?
But you made it.
Good for you.
It's been this sergeant's
experience that every soldier
that makes it through
ends up finding they have
much more inside themselves
than they ever
thought possible.
You think that's true for me?
No.
Yes. I do.
ALL: I will never
be without my rifle.
I will never be
without my rifle.
I will never be
without my rifle.
I will never be
without my rifle.
MORLEY: I can't
hear you. You what?
ALL: I will never
be without my rifle.
I will never be
without my rifle.
I need it a
little bit louder.
ALL: I will never
be without my rifle.
Private Valentine.
You were dismissed.
First Sergeant,
dismissed decided to not
let her platoon down.
You owe me one,
Valentine.
Yes, First Sergeant.
I will never be
without my rifle.
ALL: I will never
be without my rifle.
One more time.
ALL: I will never
be without my rifle.
You what?
Twenty-four.
Twenty-five.
Twenty-six.
Twenty-seven.
Twenty-eight.
I'm adjusting your strike.
JOHNSON: Don't hurt
yourself, Valentine.
Okay. You're
driving me crazy.
Move over.
This goes over...
No, no. Castillo.
Castillo, I can
do it on my own.
Nice to see you
relaxing, Jeter.
Just finished 300 Kegels,
First Sergeant.
Kegels? 300?
Well, then by all means,
at ease, Private.
Shake it off.
Shake it off.
Aside from Jeter,
this is the worst excuse
for a platoon these gorgeous
eyes have ever seen.
What the hell is that?
Whose rifle is this?
It's mine,
First Sergeant.
Hollywood, what
is your rifle doing
out of the rack?
Rifle wanted to cuddle,
First Sergeant. We made up.
Getting cute again,
Valentine?
Well, let me tell you
what I think is cute.
You on the floor with
a toothbrush scrubbing
down the filthy latrine.
That'll be one clean,
mean, fighting latrine,
First Sergeant.
It better be.
Why did you do that?
I can't stand it when
she treats you like that.
I know.
I can't help it.
Something happens
and I just freeze.
I don't know what to do.
Who's the toughest,
meanest, craziest
person you can think of?
Joe Pesci?
- Perfect.
So next time she comes up
to you like that, all you
have to do is channel Pesci.
You wanna try it?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Baby girl, you gonna cry? Huh?
You gonna cry? You gonna cry?
No, no, no. Don't cry.
Don't cry. You're not
supposed to cry.
What would Pesci do?
I don't know.
This is what
Pesci would do.
Do I look like a
fricking clown to you?
Do I amuse you?
Try it.
Okay.
Do I look like
a clown to you?
Do I amuse you?
What are you
laughing at?
You'll get it.
Just keep practicing.
Ladies,
I have a latrine to clean.
What are you
looking at?
That was cool what
you did for Petrovich.
Thanks.
Hey, Johnson, can
I ask you something?
Do I have a choice?
You really couldn't
get a job?
Oh! I can get a job,
just not a good one.
Technology is changing
every day and I need
to go back to school
and, of course, I can't
afford it. Times are tough.
But the military's
gonna give me a job,
train me in my field.
And, damn it,
I will make a better life
for me and my daughter.
Daughter?
Yeah.
My family really helped
me out after her father
died. All this is for her.
I have a niece
about the same age.
Aw!
I don't really
know her, though.
My sister and I kind of
drifted apart when my whole
acting career started.
It's like we live in
different worlds now,
you know.
Family's too important
to let it slip away,
Valentine.
If I can get away just once
just to be with my daughter,
I'd jump on it.
'Cause in the end,
they're all you've got.
Why are you
being like this?
You know that
they just give us
a 10-minute card.
Ray. Ray?
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Come on.
It's just my stupid
boyfriend, Ray.
He knows that I'm here
for med school. Yet,
every time I talk to him,
he keeps telling
me that he doesn't
know if he could wait
and how all these hot
girls are hitting on
him all the time.
At least they're girls.
Hmm?
Never mind.
Listen, Castillo. You need
to take a good look at
yourself in the mirror.
You're hot.
And medical school,
to boot?
If he wants all of this,
he needs to straighten
up and fly right.
Here. Take mine.
Call Ray and tell
him that he's lucky
to have you.
'Cause he is.
Here you go.
Johnson.
Two for you,
sweetheart.
Petrovich.
One for you, baby girl.
And Valentine.
Fan mail.
Take it to the
contraband room.
Castillo.
Sorry, Jeter.
That's okay.
Next time.
- Sure, sure.
There she is.
It's her.
There she is.
She's over here.
FEMALE REPORTER: Megan.
Look at this nonsense.
What's going on?
I am. I'm surprised
it took them this long.
Joe Kidd, paparazzo.
You ever have
a little something
you wanna share,
or any information
about Miss Valentine,
you call me.
I think I just
threw up in my mouth.
That's for personal use.
Worm. Move out.
The platoon is becoming
a sideshow, Captain.
It's unacceptable.
This sideshow is getting
the Army some of the best
publicity it has had in years.
She doesn't belong here,
Captain. The girl smiles
when she salutes.
She's affecting morale.
I'll attend training
tomorrow and make that
determination for myself.
Sir.
Let's go, Valentine.
I wanna see you
go up and over.
Hit the ground, Valentine.
Hit the ground.
That's right, girls.
Get front.
Let's see you go.
Come on. Don't give
up now, Valentine.
Go. Move, move, move.
Keep going.
Up and over,
up and over.
Nice work.
Come on, soldier.
Come on, soldier.
Come on, soldier.
Jeter's four packs
ahead of you, Valentine.
You gonna let her win?
Now, let's move.
Get up that pole.
I got this.
You can do it.
Come on, Valentine.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.
- Good job.
Come on, go!
I mean, she's really good.
Good job!
Oh, my God.
We got this, soldier.
HAMAMORI: Oh, no.
Is she taking all four?
Valentine.
PETROVICH:
She got all four bags.
We're going to win.
Oh, my God.
Damn.
It doesn't look like
Private Valentine is
upsetting morale, does it?
No, sir.
How on Earth did you do
that, Private Valentine?
This private's first film
role was that of a stripper
with a heart of gold, sir.
Nice work,
Private Valentine.
Thanks.
Carry on.
Guess if I were a whore,
I could have carried more.
CASTILLO:  Loser.
Playboy mansion.
You wish.
I got that
information for you.
Did you see Morley's face
when you came off that pole?
She was like...
You made it
look so easy, too.
Easy? I trained with
the girls from Body Shots
in LA for three weeks,
and trust me, ladies,
that is a workout.
You wanna know
what my favorite movie
of yours is, Valentine?
It's the one where you
play the disco queen,
and you're traveling
through time searching for
your magical disco ball.
That's funny.
And the dance sequence
in the end was so good.
I have the soundtrack.
Will you teach me?
Oh! I can't.
I'm shy. Let's go.
Wait a minute.
- No way.
Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.
Okay, I have to try this.
Oh, yeah.
Come on, Johnson.
I don't dance.
How can you not dance?
Because I'm black,
I'm supposed to
know how to dance?
Yeah. Come on,
you know you
wanna spank it.
Now, what is this?
Now, why wasn't I invited?
I love to dance, too.
Oh!
This is contraband
and it's illegal.
So, congratulations,
Hollywood.
You just won a three-mile
run for you, and all your
backup dancers.
What's the matter?
You can't hack it?
Hmm?
You gonna cry,
baby girl? Hmm?
You gonna cry?
Do I look like
I'm gonna cry to you,
First Sergeant?
I guess not.
Sergeant Bivens,
fall them out.
WOMAN: # I can't seem
to do a thing right
ALL: # I can't seem
to do a thing right
# Screw it up
with all my might
# Screw it up
with all my might
# Made my platoon
mates have to pay
# Made my platoon
mates have to pay
# For all my pampered
princess ways
# For all my pampered
princess ways
# I'm a...
-  # I'm a...
# Screw up
- # Screw up #
Jiminy Cricket!
Stop grinding
your damn teeth.
Petrovich,
did you just cuss?
I'm a little emotional.
You're PMSing.
Me, too.
I'd make love to a
fudge sundae right now.
Oh!
I would slap around
a jar of peanut butter.
Well, I don't know
if I'd have rough
sex with it,
but I sure do
miss chocolate.
I know where we can get
some grade-A chocolate.
Where?
Stop it.
If he barks,
we're toast.
How did you
know to do that?
Gotta get something
out of doing a talking
dog movie, right?
Come on, ladies.
- Good boy.
HAMAMORI: Oh! Nasty.
I have the best fans.
Yes, you do.
Busted.
So you're all going
down for this?
No, you...
That never happened.
HAMAMORI: How cute.
"Hi, Megan. When I grow
up, I wanna be an actress,
just like you."
CASTILLO: You gotta listen
to this one.
"When sometimes I'm
alone all by myself
at night in my cell..."
Let's just say
most of my fans
are pretty much in high school
or correctional facilities.
It must be great,
though, having people
write you letters?
Yeah, I guess.
To most people,
what I do is just fluff.
Well, I'm most people
and I love your movies.
Okay, the movie where
you played that heiress
that went to the ghetto
school to try to fit in.
And you were like, "Like,
oh, my God. What's up?
What's up? What's up?"
But what you do is funny.
It's not reality.
In reality, you would
not have made it out
of that school alive.
No.
And if I wanted reality,
I would stay home
and look at my ass
in the mirror.
When I go to a movie,
I wanna laugh.
Maybe you're right.
Okay, so,
Megan, I mean,
cough it up.
You have everything
anyone could ever
possibly want.
Why are you
really here?
My manager, Nigel, he
found me when I pretty
much had nothing.
And he told me what to wear,
what to say, how to act.
Pretty much made me
a star. He was like
a father to me, really.
Did he die?
No, he slept
with my boyfriend.
Damn.
ALL: Ouch!
My cousin Barry stole
all of my money.
So, I'm broke.
Wow.
- Ouch.
MEGAN: It's a good thing.
For the first
time in my life,
I'm my own person.
And I have
real friends.
You really mean that?
I promise.
Aw!
Okay.
Okay. Let's
open another one.
This one is from
Delores Bagoni.
ALL: Ooh!
That's my personal assistant.
"Megan, thank you
for realizing how hard it
is to take care of you.
"Sometimes, I want
to slit my wrists."
God.
"I did a little investigating
like you asked. I hope this
is what you are looking for."
Thank you, Delores.
You're now entering the
final stages of training.
At the end of next week,
you will compete in a 24-hour
tactical field exercise
that will employ everything
you've learned during Basic.
What you're about to see
is a video that highlights
what you've been taught.
What you review here
is crucial to your
success. Good luck.
GREER: Sergeant Morley,
what is this?
Give me that remote.
Give me that.
Did you know? Did you have
something to do with this?
I swear to God,
I had nothing
to do with this.
Turn it off.
Turn it...
Stop it, stop.
What the hell?
Wow.
How did you know about
Morley, Valentine?
Yeah.
I knew there was something
familiar about Morley from
the first time I saw her.
A little snooping
around from Delores,
and what do we get?
"Make me a woman, Chuck."
Hey, Hamamori,
what's up?
This. This is what's up.
"According to her
representatives,
"America's Sweetheart
is deep undercover
researching her next role,
"comically making her way
through Basic Training.
"An inside source tells us
the sheltered A-lister
"has struggled to
adjust as she finds
herself surrounded by
"what she describes
as trailer trash, gang
chicks and drug dealers."
Is that what
you think of us?
Of course not.
Did you really
say these things?
No.
No?
Yes, but it's not
how it sounds.
Megan, I'm here
trying to make
something of myself.
And you go off
and you call me
a gangbanger?
Thanks a lot.
You know, I may not
like Jeter, but at least
she is who she is.
She isn't a fake.
I changed my mind.
You are a good actress.
You said we
were friends.
We are.
I really believed you.
I really thought that
you got your heart broken,
and your bank
account emptied.
But no, this whole time you
were just here to prepare
for a stupid movie role.
That is not true.
Save it for your manager.
Oh! That's right.
He's with your
boyfriend right now.
Well, you said it best right
here, Valentine. "I don't
belong with these people."
Private Valentine,
report to the
Captain's office.
On the double.
You're sprung, kid.
How's that for an agent?
What do you mean?
We uncovered
discrepancies
in your contract.
Apparently, Sergeant First
Class Harrison, now Private
First Class Harrison,
in the recruiting office,
forwent a few crucial steps.
You were supposed
to take a physical
and an aptitude test.
You don't have either one.
Bottom line,
you're free to go.
And get this. They caught
Barry in Amsterdam.
He's already given up
information on two
offshore accounts.
So, it looks like
you are going to get
your money back.
Ah!
And you get to
keep your house.
Megan.
We were so
worried about you.
Are you okay? Oh, my God,
you don't look okay.
Okay, here, have a seat.
Sidney, what about the...
Do not worry.
Sidney is taking
care of everything.
I told the press you
were preparing for
They're eating it up.
All you have to worry
about is looking pretty
and "How I got my army abs"
in   magazine. Cover.
Yes,   magazine.
Oh, my God, how cool.
Yes, yes, yes. No, no,
no. No, no. That's not
what Megan wants.
No, no, no, no, no.
Let me tell you
what Megan wants.
Twenty-four.
Twenty-five.
Twenty-six.
Twenty-seven.
We're all waiting
on you, Valentine.
You didn't hear?
Private Valentine took
a voluntary discharge.
I didn't think
she'd quit.
You gonna
be all right?
Yeah, of course.
Yeah?
Promise.
Okay, I'll see you
tomorrow then.
Okay.
Okay. Sleep well.
Good night.
Good night,
darling.
Peek-a-boo.
Peek-a-boo,
did you miss me?
Miss Valentine.
Oh!
SIDNEY: Well, why can't
I get a reservation then?
Lemon, cayenne pepper,
and maple syrup.
I tell you, it just
cleans you right out.
Well, if you want a real
workout, you've gotta
try Kundalini yoga.
First things first.
Amber,
you're fired.
- What?
You can kiss
my ass goodbye.
I really didn't wanna
work for you anyway.
Good for you.
You should have done
that years ago. I'm almost
positive she's the one
who put up those nipple
shots of you on YouTube.
She is such
a little phony.
A phony?
- Mmm-hmm.
I think I see
a phony sitting
right in front of me.
You are so fired.
You've gotta be kidding
me. Megan, what would
you do without me?
I would wear what
I want and I would
date straight men.
What I did I do?
You screwed my boyfriend.
So? I didn't love him.
Nigel, get out.
Fine. You know, I was gonna
dump you this week anyway,
so I guess it all
just worked out fine.
Hey, Britney,
how are you?
How are the kids?
I'm good. I was just
thinking about you.
Morris.
- Yes.
I want you to hire me
a new accountant,
and I wanna sign off
on every single check,
and I wanna know all
the money that goes out.
Okay.
Sidney,
from this very moment,
I decide what film
role I take,
I decide what
interview I do,
I decide who I want to be
and I decide who I date.
Well, unless
he's really hot.
I'm not crazy
or anything.
Am I fired?
No.
Are we clear?
I said, are we clear?
ALL: Yes, absolutely.
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
Good. As you were.
I'll see you guys
next week, okay?
Where are you going?
To finish what I started.
Your final field training
exercise is a test of all
the skills you have learned.
This will also be a timed
test of endurance and how
you work as a team.
Your squad...
Well, if it isn't
Miss Grace.
Welcome back, Hollywood.
As I was saying, your
platoon will be divided
into squads of five.
I will appoint a leader
for each squad.
You will be given a map,
coordinates, and a compass.
You will not be
given any food.
You will be given MREs.
That's Meals Ready-to-Eat
stashed along your route.
Now, if you don't find them,
or somebody steals them,
then you don't eat.
Your squad's objective is
to locate a wounded soldier,
represented by a dummy.
You must then
transport him
to the Emergency Field
Hospital located in our
Urban Warfare Center.
You will be in
full combat mode
until you get there.
An aggressor team will
be trying to stop you.
They are some of the
meanest, toughest, baddest
graduates we have.
They are all awaiting
Ranger training and can't
wait to capture you.
Now, if what can only
be called dumb luck,
and you happen to
capture one of them,
your squad gets
one hour deducted
from your time.
Don't get happy.
This has never happened
before, platoon. So don't
count on it.
Any team not crossing the
finish line within 24 hours,
must repeat the
full exercise.
Squad leaders are
Jeter, Gableson,
Young, and Valentine.
Hey, Johnson, you, me,
Castillo and Petrovich
are on the Blue Team.
Great. Guess who
our leader is?
You guys ready to save
some dummy's ass?
We're not worried
about you, Valentine.
Congratulations.
For what?
Coming back. Finish
what you started.
Thank you, Sergeant.
And you got me
as your land grader.
Sweet. What does that mean?
It means I'll be coming
along with your team.
Strictly as an observer
and a safety net, every
step along the way.
And I can't help you.
You already have,
Sergeant.
It's good to have
you back, Valentine.
It's good to be back,
Sergeant.
Hey, Jeter.
Good luck out there.
Precision, skill, plus
an iron will doesn't
need luck, movie star.
Oh! I forgot.
May the best team win.
Don't you have a mani-pedi
or spray tan appointment
you need to get to?
Actually,
I canceled them
just to come back
and challenge you.
Ooh! You must
be Scary Spice.
Boo!
I got three words for you.
Honor, pride and integrity.
Well, I've got
five words for you.
You need to get laid.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
You're going down,
Army Barbie.
Due to circumstances I can
control, I won't be making
this journey with you.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Move out.
Wait for me,
I'm coming.
Well, it looks like
we're suffering for
Valentine yet again.
Yeah, it looks that way.
Come on, I came
back, didn't I?
Don't do us any
favors, Valentine.
Like it or not, I'm your
team leader and I have
something to say.
Yes, I screwed up,
but you have to
give me another chance.
Why? Because, Johnson,
you wanna go home and
see your little girl.
Castillo, if you don't go
home soon, your boyfriend's
gonna cheat on you.
And, Hamamori, weed
doesn't grow on its own.
Petrovich? I wanna do
this for your brother
as much as you do.
So what do you say?
Are we gonna do this?
Is the speech over?
Damn, you girls are
tough. Now, move out.
Good try.
Would you look at this?
Looks like little
blonde Riding Hood
bought us lunch.
Anybody hungry?
Help yourselves.
I'm not your Sherpa.
You can all split mine,
'cause I'm already full
on determination and pride.
Double time.
Hmm?
I think my compass
is broken.
You got that right.
Give me that.
First of all,
it's backwards.
Where the heck are we?
This doesn't make
any sense. Valentine,
let me see that map.
I'm starving, guys.
Me, too.
I could have sworn
I put it in here.
So help me God, Valentine,
if you don't have that map...
It's gone.
You're kidding, right?
I told you she'd screw up.
Of course she screwed up.
She's a self-absorbed
prima donna who only
cares about herself.
PETROVICH: Well, you don't
have to be so mean, Castillo.
She came back.
Please, are you speaking
for the entire fan club?
HAMAMORI: Don't make her
cry, Castillo.
I'm not gonna cry.
I'm gonna kick your ass.
Okay. Well, bring
it on, cry baby.
I'm not gonna...
HAMAMORI:
Hey! Take it easy.
Enough. Enough!
If we're gonna make
it through this, we
gotta work as a team.
Hamamori, you're the one
who always has your hand up
in those navigation classes.
Help us out.
I mean, we might be
able to get
to the first navigation point
using dead reckoning.
Everybody got a
full belly? Good.
Fitzsimmons, you're on
first shift guard duty.
Berky. You're next.
Everyone gonna
turn in real early
because my team leaves
before first light.
We're gonna get
this wounded soldier
to the hospital first.
Why?
Because he's got a family
at home worried sick that
he's not coming back.
And the last thing his
wife is thinking is that
he's cheating on her
with the girl
from Circuit City
with the fake tits
who sold her the plasma
TV screen that she bought
for him for his birthday!
Lights out.
JOHNSON: Here we go.
Jeter.
I'm starving.
And I don't do bugs.
What I would give
for a burrito con pollo
right now.
I'd do a Number 5
with a super scoop
of curly fries.
You guys and your love
for processed foods.
We should be living
off of the land.
I can't eat land.
Petrovich, you brought the
mosquito netting, right?
Yeah.
Who's read the book,
Well, if you haven't,
you should.
It's a good book.
Anyway, when my dad
read it to me,
he also told me that when
you pee-pee in the water,
it attracts fish.
That's disturbing.
Who's gotta go?
Come on,
you can do it.
Okay, top or bottom?
Top.
- Top.
Fish fry?
Okay, Castillo,
start the fire.
I don't have
any matches.
Anyone?
Hey.
- You're the best sergeant ever.
But if you use them,
you'll be disqualified.
PETROVICH: And then
we're gonna have to
do this all over again.
Yeah, but, guys,
we still gotta eat.
Okay. It'll be
a little bland, but...
Sashimi anyone?
PETROVICH: Whoa!
This is great.
And who's gonna
make fun of me now?
JOHNSON: Soy sauce?
Oh, yeah.
What's up?
What's up? What's up?
JOHNSON: Girlfriend
loves soy sauce.
This is so good. But aren't
we gonna be hungry again,
like, in half an hour.
That's Chinese.
And no offense taken.
I am so tired,
you guys.
We should have found
our soldier already.
I bet you Jeter has hers
ball-gagged by now.
We gotta be, like, three hours
behind everybody else, right?
Yeah, we're gonna have
to haul ass at daylight.
So we should
probably turn it in?
Yeah.
Hamamori, first watch?
I'll clean up.
You got it.
Thanks.
A little help here?
You're doing okay on
your own, Valentine.
PETROVICH: How much further?
We're close. I know it.
There it is!
Finally.
We should call
him Bernie.
Have you seen that movie?
JOHNSON: I'll rent it.
Let's do this, guys.
We have about two
hours to get Bernie
to the hospital.
If we follow these
coordinates, it's at
least a five-hour hike.
Then we'll never make it.
Maybe we can hitch a ride.
That would disqualify you.
Can we talk
to a civilian?
As long as you
don't touch them.
Hot damn! Megan Valentine.
Hey, I just seen
that
You owe me eight bucks.
You do a sequel,
little less dog,
little more doggie style,
you know what I'm saying?
Good note. Could you
do something for me?
Hot damn, girl.
Would you press that
button right there?
What, that little
button right there?
That little
button right there.
I need some direction.
I gotta get this guy Bernie
to the Urban Warfare Center.
Mr. Start? Hi.
How are you?
I'm good. But I'm lost.
Yeah. That one. What's the
quickest way to get there?
Is there a quicker
way to get there?
It's one mile
straight through.
Okay. Army time.
Are we tough enough?
ALL: Yes.
Are we brave enough?
ALL: Yes.
Are we ready to
kick some ass?
ALL: Yes.
I think I'm
gonna throw up.
You're in the right
place for that. Let's go!
Are we dumb enough?
Enemy aggressor at 12 o'clock.
Divert to side entrance.
CASTILLO: Oh, man. Jeter.
They've won.
Not yet. We get
an hour off per ranger.
Peek-a-boo.
Congratulations,
Private Jeter.
You not only won the
challenge but you also
won the overnight pass.
You can pass that pass
right on over here.
I don't believe it.
By my count, we have
beat the Red Team by
an hour and a half.
Ooh!
But you can't count.
She can't count.
Sorry, Jeter.
Congratulations,
Valentine.
She can't count.
Yes!
Awesome!
MEGAN: That's what
I'm talking about.
That's what I'm
talking about.
Come on.
Oh, yeah.
Who won? We won. We won.
When each of
you arrived here,
you were unshaped, unsure,
but full of potential.
You've been
through the fire.
You've come out
stronger. Stronger
than you ever imagined.
You're now a soldier
in the United States Army.
Congratulations, Petrovich.
Your brother would be proud.
Thank you, sir.
Job well done.
- Yes, sir.
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.
Johnson, good for you.
Thank you, sir.
Private Valentine.
I knew you had it in you.
That's so sweet.
Thank you.
Good job.
I can't believe
you're leaving right
after graduation.
Me either.
But that's the deal
I made with Captain Greer.
He'd let me finish Basic
Training, then I'd go be
with the USO for a year.
Sidney's gonna kill me.
We're gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you guys.
But there's strong,
and then there's Army strong.
Pass and review.
Forward march!
Step, step, step.
EVANS: Eyes, right!
Basic is over.
You may now greet
your families.
You jerk.
Hey! Hey, you guys.
MEGAN: Aw! Thank you
so much for coming.
JINNY: Well, thanks
for inviting us.
All those letters
that you wrote meant
so much to the kids.
They meant a lot
to me, too.
Jinny, I know it's hard
being my sister sometimes.
And I have a lot
of making up to do.
But I want you to know
that my priorities
are different now.
I really miss you.
I miss you, too.
Look at you.
Excuse me.
Hi.
I just wanted to say,
well done, Private.
Thank you, Private.
You deserve
those stripes back.
I know.
And that comment that
I made the other day?
About me needing
to get laid? I will.
Jeter, can I hug you?
No.
That personal space
is reserved.
Get back on that
horse, girl.
Okay.
Private Valentine.
Hey.
It was impressive
what you did out there.
It was the whole platoon.
We did it together.
No, I mean, coming
back and finishing.
That took guts, Private.
Thank you.
That means a lot
coming from you.
USO, huh?
Yeah. And you?
Back to screaming
about your grandma?
No.
This is my last cycle here.
I ship off next week for Iraq.
Wow.
- Tell me about it.
So, does this mean
you're not my
sergeant anymore?
No, I'm not.
Well, I better get going.
Everybody's waiting.
Hey, Evans.
I expect that back.
Hey!
