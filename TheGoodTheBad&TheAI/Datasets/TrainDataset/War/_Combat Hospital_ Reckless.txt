Take your places please,
this contest is going to
begin in T-5 minutes.
Our first team,
their always there in a pinch.
Fighting for freedom, the queen,
and their right to boil
their beef.
They are team Britain!
You better run!
You better hide!
It's team Australia!
We would've won.
- We eat that for a snack, man.
- That's right. We would've won.
Hey, you guys, where are
you going? Wrong direction.
- Party's that way.
- Uh, we just got beeped.
We gotta be in Hutal
by nightfall.
Hey, have you seen Bobby?
'Cause I bet him
a week's worth of coffee that
the Canadians were gonna beat
the Americans under the table.
The way our team's chowing down,
you're gonna lose that money.
Okay, the U.S. may have
a higher obesity rate
than Canada,
but we know how to eat kebabs.
Douche bags.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Ray. How's it going?
The beautiful
Dr. Rebecca Gordon.
Mm. Marry me. I will
take you away from all of this.
We'll settle in Florida,
have a whole lot of babies.
Hmm.
I think that I'll stick
with trauma surgery
in Kandahar.
Well...
- Burn!
- Burn!
Dr. Rebecca,
I'm in a bit of a bind here.
Hmm.
Uh, long story short, we have
a hell of a stretch to Hutal,
and I need me some go.
"Go"?
As in pill-poppin',
"need for speed" kind of go?
Mm.
That is for your flight surgeon
to deal with.
Yeah, he's all the way
across base,
but you are right here,
and the pharmacy
is just inches away.
I'm sorry. Ray, I don't feel
comfortable handing out
a heavy-duty stimulant like candy.
Are you serious?
This is standard stuff,
plus, we are
practically engaged here.
No, we are nowhere near engaged,
and the answer is still no.
I'm sorry.
Hey. Hey, look, if...
If you need some downtime...
You know what?
Just forget I asked.
Enjoy your kebabs.
Yes, can you believe how fast
these contestants are slamming
those little pieces of piggy
down their throat?
And the first person is France
to slow down,
and she is out!
Deutschland has had too much.
Australia is still in,
and the Canadian
is still going strong,
and America is out!
Yeah!
And the Netherlands drops out!
Deutschland and Hungary
not so  anymore,
but Romania and Canada still
going strong.
Romania...
Romania looks...
and no, he is over.
He is out!
We have a winner...
The Canadian
from the Kabul base!
Oh!
Whoo!
I say, to hell with country
and base battles,
'cause I...
am repping the estrogen empire!
Whoo! What do I win, sir?
You have won
this fetching blue ribbon.
May I pin it on you?
Wow. Thanks.
Wait, wait. What about
the guy in the tower?
Are we doing this,
or are we doing this?
Really?
Yeah.
Let's go.
Get up here now.
Come on!
Ohh.
Come here. Come here.
Mm.
Mm.
Wait, wait, wait. Shh.
Ohh.
I think I heard someone.
No, you didn't.
You didn't hear Marks
or Will or anyone else,
so...
Ooh. Hey, hey. Yeah.
Ooh, yeah. Thank you.
No, thank you.
Ohh.
Why is it that you're
everywhere work isn't?
Oh, come now, Rebecca.
A man who spends all day
on the rumor mill...
He deserves some sort
of respite, doesn't he?
God, you are just all walls
and wisecracks, aren't you?
Yeah.
Well...
I'm not exactly alone behind
the great wall now, am I?
You spend all hours of the night
jogging around the base
like you're being chased.
Why exactly?
Mm.
That's gonna be a problem.
Yeah, more than you know.
That's the chef.
Mm.
Mm.
The whole "no sex on base" rule...
Marks doesn't take it
seriously, right?
No, he takes everything
seriously.
We could get kicked off base
for this?
We could roll over
an I.E.D.
and get shipped home
in a coffin.
That's comforting.
Mm.
Ohh.
It's Kandahar, Bobby.
Every day is a risk.
So the question is,
you want to take this risk
with me?
Ohh.
Oh, no. Gotta go.
Gotta go.
- Mm.
- Where's my shirt?
- Here. Swap.
- Here.
Is that mine or yours?
That's yours. No, that's yours.
Just wait there.
I'm gonna get to you.
Shrapnel rips through walls...
Everyone's fine.
One cook with gastro
grills meat...
Role 3 task force, Kandahar
South. Corday speaking.
I lose half the base.
A 9-liner?
Thank you.
Downed chopper?
Is it one of ours?
Make up as many bottles
of oral rehydration solution
as possible.
Okay, so it's, uh,
bacterial, not viral?
Most likely.
Symptoms came on
two hours after exposure.
We're still waiting
on the cultures.
Okay.
Did we page everyone?
Yeah, if they're not puking
their guts out,
they're on their feet
helping out,
except for Bobby, Suzy,
and Simon.
Yeah, well...
Colonel.
Have an incoming 9-liner.
Downed chopper 91.
Three injured.
No other information.
Did they say who?
All I know is,
Ray's bringing it in.
Uh, TOC's still trying
to decipher the details.
E.T.A.'s about 30 minutes.
Which means
the investigative team
will be here in 31 minutes.
Listen, I want everyone
to cooperate.
They're gonna be asking
a lot of questions.
Some of it may seem invasive,
but remember, these men are just
trying to do their job.
Cockroaches.
We'll get the ready room prepped
for our ailing kebab friends.
We're gonna want to bring in
the flight surgeon
for this 9-liner.
Call Ben-Meir.
Et tu, Graham?
Oh.
I'm sorry, sir.
Ohh.
I'm gonna be fine, sir.
No, you're not fine.
You're off duty as of now.
No, no, no. Sir, please.
Oh, I haven't missed
a day's work in my life.
You've gotta give me
something to do.
All right. There's a patient
in Major Pedersen's office
she got the worst of it,
and I want to make sure that
she keeps hydrated.
Think you can handle that?
Yes, sir. I can handle that.
All right.
Go. Something wrong with
your pager there, doctor?
No, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
All right.
Just help with the solutions.
Yes, sir.
All right.
Where the hell is Dr. Hill?!
I'll, uh, I'll get that.
We're missing Dr. Hill!
Oh, Rebecca, can you pass me
a bottle of lytes?
Uh, yeah. Sure thing.
Let me hold it.
You go.
Uh, Suzy?
Mm-hmm.
You got a little...
Oh. That explains
the whistles.
Oh. All right.
Hello? Dr. Hill?
He's not home.
but in anger,
not in fear
for when your day is done
oh
Did I say, "come in"?
Colonel Marks is looking
for you.
Yelling for you, actually.
Are those what I think
they are?
Yes.
And on that note, au revoir.
But everyone is vomiting.
They need help with cleanup.
Look, it's below
my pay grade, okay?
So tell Colonel Marks
I send my regrets,
and I also have this bug
that's buzzing around.
And in the meantime, you can
be my agent in absentia.
Your what?
I authorize you to speak
on my behalf.
I give you
my power of attorney,
so go.
Good-bye. Good luck.
Excuse me.
Colonel Marks asked me
to look in on you
for a little while.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Oh, it's you.
Hey, you... you don't have to,
if you don't...
No, no, no.
It's okay.
I think I just threw up
a French fry from 1988.
Ohh.
You got it, too?
You know me and kebabs.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Yeah.
No, no, no. Don't.
Don't do that.
- Don't vomit. If you vomit, I will vomit.
- Ohh.
I'm good.
Ohh.
Are you gonna be okay
with this?
Sure. Come on.
Not every day
I get to spend puking...
with my ex-husband.
All right. Any other symptoms
other than your stomach?
I have a bad, bad headache.
Uh, well, you know,
bad headaches are not uncommon.
You know what?
How about... here we go.
Can I get one of those, nurse?
Drink one of these,
uh, get some good rest,
and you'll be great
in about a day or two.
- You're good. Come on.
- What are you doing here?
There we go. Oh, man.
Just feeling a little out of sorts.
Okay. Well, if your
insides aren't flying out,
then consider yourself
a lucky man.
I'm getting luckier
by the second.
Bobby, I can finish up here.
All right, listen up!
Choppers have landed.
One bravo, two alphas.
Which T.T.L.s are free?
Uh, we're done here.
All right.
- I'll get bay 2 ready, sir.
- Okay, good.
- We'll take the bravo over there.
- Yes, sir.
All right?
The alphas will have to wait,
if need be.
No solids for the next
- Yeah.
- You'll be fine.
- Ohh.
- Hey.
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Oh! Hey!
Bobby, take him to I.C.U.
Figure out what's wrong
with him.
Okay.
All right. You've had
T.T.L. experience, right?
- Yes, sir.
- Take bay 1.
Colonel, thank you
for calling me.
You're the flight surgeon.
We got a pilot coming in.
Take bay 2.
Yes, sir.
All right.
All right.
I need five med techs.
Come this way.
Hang in there, son.
Bravo. Bay 2!
Okay, people, they're here!
B.P. 70 over palp.
Pulse 140.
Intubated in the field.
Extensive burns...
Face, arms, right leg.
Possible internal injuries.
Broken right femur.
Start him on Ringers.
Punch in the parkland formula.
Let's get him fully exposed
so we can evaluate
all his injuries.
I need x-rays and ultrasound
on this patient,
and I need them now.
It's Ray.
Ford and Mehra.
Trauma 1. Alpha!
Get Mehra inside.
All right. B.P. 130 over 80.
Pulse 112.
Minor lac... face and hands.
Hematoma right leg.
Fentanyl lollipop given
in the field.
Ford, stay with me.
You're gonna be all right, son.
B.P. 140 over 80.
Pulse 110.
Right shoulder dislocation.
Laceration lower right arm.
He's going to need
escharotomies.
O.R. 2 is ready.
No time.
We'll do it here.
Rebecca, how's Mehra?
Stable for now.
Take over here.
Hang in there, Mehra.
Hang in there, okay?
You're in good hands now.
We got you.
The E.T. tube doesn't have
good placement.
It must have dislodged.
Can't get good placement.
There's too much swelling
in the soft tissue.
Bay 3, Rebecca.
Right now.
We need to cric him.
V-fib. We're losing him.
Get the crash cart.
Check pulse. Start C.P.R.
Stop C.P.R.
Charge 200. Clear?
Clear.
Get me 40 of vasopressin.
Charge 300.
Clear?
Clear.
Flatline. Start C.P.R.
Call it.
Time of death...
Okay.
Ohh.
Any, um...
Any history of anemia,
dizzy spells,
low blood pressure?
No.
It's like being sidelined
in the play-offs, isn't it?
What?
Oh. No.
No, man. Every, uh,
every patient's a priority.
Okay, any history of anemia,
dizzy spells,
low blood pressure?
Ohh.
Whoa. What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Your friends need you.
Don't tie yourself up
with a little indigestion.
Indigestion's one thing,
but fever and fainting...
No, man. Just get back in bed.
What? I'm fine.
I'm... I feel better already.
Look, I'm the diagnostician.
I diagnose...
which means I tell you
when it's fine.
You don't tell me, all right?
Now get back in bed.
Please?
All right.
That's right, man.
I thought agony was strictly
a defeat thing.
Yeah, well, live and learn.
You know, I think you might be
a little more comfortable.
If you took
this uniform top off.
I'm on duty.
Ohh.
You're not trying to get me
naked, are you?
Yes.
You got me all figured out.
Come here.
Thanks.
Yeah.
What happened
to, uh, Dr. Pedersen?
I came looking for her earlier.
Oh, she's at FOB Ireland
doing psych evals.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, you got the hots
for Dr. Pedersen, do you?
What does Helen think
about that?
Don't go there, Graham.
Anyway...
We broke up two months ago.
You broke up with her?
And you didn't think
to tell me?
Why would I tell you?
I think I'd want to know
about you breaking up
with the woman
that you left me for.
Why, so you could gloat?
Hey. I just heard
what happened.
I was just talking to Ray.
I mean,
he was asking me about...
Oh, my God.
I think I did something wrong.
Major Gordon.
This is Colonel Axelquist.
U.S. Air Force
Board of Investigations.
The colonel
is setting up interviews
with anyone who had any contact
with Ray or his crew.
Do you have a few minutes?
This is a standard
investigative procedure, major.
We're just trying to get
as complete a picture
as possible
on the events leading
up to the crash.
We have
a few preliminary questions.
Is this about the go pills?
Uh, Ray...
Excuse me...
Uh, Captain Ludford,
uh, caught me on the fly
as he was leaving.
He asked me
for some stimulants,
and I said no.
Well, let me get this straight.
Captain Ludford was fatigued,
and he asked you for go pills,
and you refused?
May I remind you, colonel,
that it's not Canadian policy
to give fatigued pilots
stimulants?
Thank you, colonel.
So Captain Ludford came
to you exhausted?
No, I didn't say
he was exhausted.
He was just kidding around,
and I told him that
if he really needed the pills,
he needed to go
to his flight surgeon.
Did you follow up
with the flight surgeon?
No, I didn't.
And did you report this
to Colonel Marks?
No.
It was no big thing.
Well, doctor,
we have a dead pilot
and a dead copilot
and two injured parajumpers.
I would say it was
a big thing, wouldn't you?
Colonel, may we have a moment?
We'll resume this later.
I'm not sure Major Gordon
understands the situation,
colonel.
Maybe you can help her.
Come on.
What the hell was that about?
He was just trying
to do his job.
Now the most common reason
for a chopper to go down
is pilot error,
and what Axelquist is doing
is asking you
to try to help him figure out
if that's the case.
Now if you're unwilling
to cooperate,
there will be consequences
for you,
either for not reporting Ray
to the flight surgeon
and preventing him from flying.
Or not giving him go pills.
You're not this sick.
Why aren't you this sick?
Because I had one kebab.
You had 23.
Ooh.
The dimenhydrinate should be
kicking in right now.
Okay. You okay?
You hate me, don't you...
for leaving you?
You always get emotional
when you're sick.
Um...
Tell me a... a story.
One with a happy ending.
Okay.
Well...
Well, once upon a time,
there was
a beautiful princess...
and she was smart,
athletic,
great in bed.
She was the fairest
in the land...
and she was loved
by a young boy
from the wrong side
of the tracks.
Don't tell me this story.
This is a sad story.
Once upon a time,
there was
a beautiful, big blue platypus.
It was smart, athletic...
fantastic in bed.
Better than the princess.
Mm. Princesses.
Ohh.
We were happy together,
weren't we,
until you started working
all the time?
What I mean...
and it had nothing to do with
the fact that you fell in love
with someone else.
Ohh.
Hey. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Just got up a bit fast.
Think I'm dehydrated.
I'm sorry.
I can see you're not
a fan of sleep,
but, uh, soap and water is
everyone's friend.
Forgive me for putting
your health above my hygiene.
Yes, take a shower.
How's he doing?
He's good.
Hey, hey. It's okay.
Ray?
I'm sorry, T.
Can I help you?
Dr. Hill?
Are they okay?
Yeah, they will be. Yeah.
Why, do you want to see them?
Yes, but, Dr. Hill,
there are two Afghan men
waiting for you at the gate.
They need to speak
with you urgently
something about your farm.
My farm? What do you mean?
I don't know,
but they're angry.
Uh, okay. Well, just find out
what you can, all right?
I'm sure your agent skills
will come in handy.
Okay. I'll be right back.
Can you tell us what happened?
He came in in a bad way.
He had 50% burns on his body,
and, uh, internal injuries.
- Your friends lost someone, huh?
- Yeah. Captain Ray Ludford.
He was a friend of mine
as well.
Kind of. I-I didn't know
him very long, but...
You don't have to know someone
long in this place.
You know, sometimes a day...
it's enough to form
a deep, lasting bond.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm sorry
you're not feeling well.
Well, so am I.
I mean, you, me, and a bed?
It's kind of a waste.
You know, don't get me wrong.
I'm glad I have an excuse
to see you again.
Just wish it was under
better circumstances.
Me, too.
Graham.
Graham.
Graham.
Yeah.
You're snoring.
Sorry. You need anything?
Mm...
Oh, I haven't felt like
throwing up in over an hour.
That's improvement.
You're out of uniform.
Off duty.
Oh.
You don't have to stay.
Hey. Where are you going?
I gotta pee.
Ooh.
Hang on. Hang on.
Mm.
Ohh. Mm.
Mm.
I...
cannot be your rebound person.
Graham, I don't...
Let's get you to the bathroom.
Okay. You're okay.
I need to speak
with Major Gordon.
Dr. Gordon.
Excuse me. I wanted to give
our young men some time
to rest before we chatted,
but it appears they're awake.
I just have a few questions.
Okay.
Gentlemen.
How you holding up?
Good.
Did the captain seem incoherent
or fatigued in any way?
No. Not at all, sir.
The engine.
Yeah. The, uh...
The engine felt off, sir.
Uh, the flight safety team
has yet to find any signs
of mechanical failure.
I know my copters
and I know Ray.
The engine was off.
He wasn't.
Well, come now, sergeant
we both know human error r...
Yeah, but you
weren't there, okay?
- You don't know what happened!
- Hey! Hey, hey! Hey!
Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.
Get out! Major, I can
hardly be held responsible...
That wasn't
a request, colonel.
There are a lot of eyes
on this investigation, colonel,
and they have
a lot of questions,
such as why Major Gordon
failed to treat
a clearly fatigued pilot
according to protocol,
for instance.
I'll let you get back to work.
Major Gordon...
We'll speak again soon.
Colonel.
Uh, okay, okay. Okay, okay.
What's going on?
They say they care
for the crops on your farm,
but it seems they have come
to a situation of disagreement.
Listen, I-I haven't got
time for this.
I need you to sort this out.
You mean be your agent?
Yeah, like, uh...
Yeah, like Jerry Maguire.
I've seen
the "Jerry Maguire" DVD.
Three times.
He makes money to be
an agent...
So much money,
they show it to him.
Okay, fine. Fine. Uh, just...
Just name your price, okay?
Hey.
Hey. Hi.
How are you doing?
I'm gonna need those labs
A.S.A.P., major.
Yes, captain.
Done.
I'm back in five.
Thank you.
She likes you.
Do you like her?
You know, my dad told me once.
That if you like a woman,
you should tell her,
and if you don't,
well, you should tell
her that, too.
It's simple.
Unless...
You like another woman more.
- There's no other woman.
- No?
No.
I mean, who else? No.
There's no one.
Dr. Gordon?
Rebecca?
No, we're just friends, man.
Well, if you say so.
You haven't figured anything
out yet, have you?
Look, I'm telling you,
we're just friends, all right?
Just drop it.
You haven't figured
out what's wrong with me.
Right.
No. Not yet, but I will.
You've been bested
by a bug, doctor.
It happens.
Hmm.
Thanks.
Sip it slow.
There's a bucket there,
should the need arise.
Where did you get a rose
on base?
I mean, in Kandahar?
You know me.
Yeah, I do.
No urge to hurl.
I think
the worst has passed.
Yep.
You're back in uniform.
Yep. I'm on duty in, um...
three and a half minutes.
Graham.
Thank you.
It wasn't so bad, was it...
when we were married?
No.
We were good together.
I still love you.
Uh...
I gotta go.
Just a few more minutes.
I...
I can check back with you
in an hour.
Graham, wait.
Ohh.
Okay, go.
See ya later.
Hey, any news yet?
Just waiting
for the C.T. scan.
Just, uh, checking in.
So... Rebecca.
Yes. Rebecca.
Right.
You two are kinda...
We're just friends.
Friends.
Right. Ahem.
No, man,
I mean, you... you consumed
a substantial amount
of food this week
maybe it is dietary after all.
We've got dolma, mantu,
kufta, shami,
rice, rice, and more rice,
maushuwa...
That wasn't a week.
That was a Friday.
What can I say?
I'm not a salad guy.
Yeah, but even so, man,
I mean, if you're eating
like a linebacker
and fainting like a debutante,
nutrients are clearly
not being absorbed.
I don't think a scan is actually
gonna tell us very much.
You're gonna have to give me
a sample, my friend.
Not the kind that goes tinkle.
All right, sergeant.
If anything else occurs
in the next few days,
don't hesitate.
- If you could, uh...
- Yes?
Tell me why I'm being asked
to comment on this.
Dismissed.
Thank you for your time.
"'Flying high in the skies, '.
By Warren Wilder
of 'The National Insight.'"
Thanks, but I prefer
"The Times."
"While there can be no denying
the overall effectiveness
of Kandahar's
role 3 hospital..."
"Conflicting national policies
on medical treatment
of fatigued pilots can produce
decidedly deadly results."
Well, Mr. Wilder certainly has
a particular perspececve.
I wonder how he came to that.
If you're making
an accusation, colonel,
let's make it
quickly and clearly.
When it comes
to care in this hospital,
it's not personal.
It sure as hell
isn't political.
It's not about laying blame.
It's about
finding responsibility.
Now can you have Major Gordon
meet me here in 30 minutes?
Hi.
Hey.
Well, congratulations.
You are the proud father
of a tapeworm.
Well, at least it's the lesser
of the possible medical evils.
No, you don't understand.
I-I don't even fish
with worms,
and I have one inside of me?
I...
I don't feel so g...
Tough guy has
a squeamish spot, huh?
Oh, and the
tough girl doesn't?
Uh, look, it's okay.
I understand if this all
makes you uneasy.
Mm. No, no. It's not...
It's not you.
It's just, um...
I have a lot on my plate
right now.
With that colonel,
that investigator?
Listen, I've seen
so many men like him.
You know, they're just
all full of bluster.
It's not him I'm worried about.
What if I made
the wrong decision?
If Ray was fatigued,
maybe I should've given him
the pills.
Even the very best of us
can only do our best, Rebecca.
The only question
you have to answer is,
did you?
You don't have to write it down.
You can just tell me.
You've gotta be kidding.
Look, you are mediating
a small dispute, okay?
It's not world peace.
I think that's a very fair fee.
Fair to you, maybe.
Okay. Okay.
This is so stupid.
Ohh.
Okay. What do you want?
I've always wanted
a pair of Italian shoes.
The pint-sized hustler's
got me over a barrel
with the whole
"I can't speak Farsi" thing.
I'm trying not to worm
out of this man.
Please don't use the "w" word.
So the Suzy thing...
Is it bad sex, good sex?
Suzy?
It might not just be Suzy.
I'm glad to see you guys find
my life so amusing.
What? Look, I like Suzy,
but I can't have her
thinking that, uh,
this is going somewhere
that it's not.
Ohh.
You know, if Suzy thinks
she's gonna find
the fairy tale here,
then she's deluding herself.
Man, you gotta be honest
with her, man.
You can't string her along.
It's cruel.
Oh, we're all bastards
on the inside.
Although in your case,
you're like a worm factory.
You know, if the thought of that
didn't make me nauauous,
I'd kill you with this bowl.
En guarde.
I'd like to see that, actually.
Okay, I'm gonna get you
to roll up on your side
and open your mouth, all right?
Ohh.
Wait a second.
How does this work?
Oh, it's actually
pretty simple.
You just lay in this position
- and the tapeworm, attracted to the smell...
- Oh, God.
- and the warmth of the curdled milk...
- Oh!
will crawl up
and out your open mouth.
Then once it's in sight...
Uh, what?
It's gonna come up through...
through...
Whoa. I didn't expect him
to pass out like that.
Yeah, I thought he'd puke.
- Nice.
- Yeah.
We'll start him on a run
of praziquantel,
and, uh, the worm should be
dead in a day or two.
We'll watch him
until he's clear.
I'm impressed, Dr. Trang.
You know, letting
your inner bastard shine.
You here?
I got a few minutes.
We're back on the record.
So are you familiar
with studies
on the safety and effectiveness
of stimulant use.
in extended flight operations?
Only with those that
you sent me this morning.
And when you declined
to give Captain Ludford
the medication  he requested,
you were not familiar
with these studies
at the time, correct?
Correct.
Knowing what you know now,
would your decision
have been different?
No.
Even though these studies show
that stimulant use
under medical supervision
is both safe and effective,
and even though stimulants
are routinely used
to treat narcolepsy
and A.D.H.D.,
even in children?
Captain Ludford showed no signs
of A.D.H.D. or narcolepsy.
or of excessive fatigue,
either, for that matter.
Are, uh, stimulant drugs
ever given to Canadian forces
in flight operations?
No. Not that I know of.
Well, forgive me, major,
I've been accused of playing
politics in this investigation,
but isn't it the worst kind
of politics to deny
our men and women whatever help
they need to do their duty?
I do not and will not prescribe
such a serious psychostimulant
with reckless abandon...
without a physical,
without a history,
and without a damn good reason.
Now if I had any reason
to believe at all
That Captain Ludford really
needed such a drug,
I would have done everything
in my power
to stop him from flying.
And if you're wrong, major?
If...
it proves that pilot fatigue
played a role in the crash,
then yes,
that will be on my conscience.
All I can say to you is
that in my brief encounter
with Captain Ludford, he showed
no evidence of impairment,
and my decision would be
exactly the same.
Thank you.
The unused piece of land
at the back of your farm...
you know the one
you promised to them both?
Well, surprise, surprise.
They both want it.
Right. Explain to them
that I made a mistake.
I did. So...
So? Look, you're wearing
your payday.
Go to it, Mr. Maguire.
Dr. Hill...
Consortium?
Concert?
Concert?
Ohh.
Okay?
Mister.
All right. Very good.
Okay.
Thanks, doctor.
Bless you, doctor.
What did you say to them?
Neither will use
the land themselves
instead they'll rent it out
and split the profits.
Everybody's happy.
So it's... it's done, yeah?
Not quite.
Now it's done.
Hey.
Look, uh...
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry I've been weird.
You know, I had
an amazing time the other day.
I got a million things
on my plate right now,
you know, and... and maybe
in a different place,
a different time, it would be
a different story,
but right now, here, it just...
I don't... I don't think this
can go anywhere.
You thought I wanted this
to go somewhere?
I'm fine with the fling thing.
In fact, I'm feeling
a little flingy right now.
Oh.
Mmm.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing?
That's nasty.
What?
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.
Hey.
- How are you doing?
- Good.
Good.
Hey, look, Suzy told us
what you did back there.
Thank you.
No, I didn't do anything, T.
They've cleared Captain Ray.
Colonel, uh, sorry,
but what does that mean?
Was it human error,
mechanical, medical, what?
The pilot was cleared.
That's all the man
from Washington would say.
That's not much of an apology.
You take what you can get,
Rebecca.
Doctor...
No, I know. I should've come
to you about Ray. I know.
All right.
Oh, and for the record,
I'm very proud of the way
you handled yourself
in there today, major.
Thank you, sir.
almost in a daze,
it comes to me
there's no place at all
I'd sooner be
So chai on the boardwalk?
That's almost a date.
Well, it's as close
as you get in Kandahar.
Slow the time
and soak it up
