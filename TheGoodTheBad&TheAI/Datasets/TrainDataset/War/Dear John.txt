There's something l want to tell you.
{MUFFLED GUNFIRE}
you want to know the very first thing
that entered my mind
l'm 8 years old again
on a tour of the U.S. Mint.
l'm listening to a guide explain
how coins are made.
How they're punched
out of sheet metal.
How they are stamped
and cleaned.
And how each and every batch
of coins are personally examined
just in case any have
slipped through with
the slightest imperfection.
l am a coin
in the United States Army.
{INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE}
l was minted in the year 1980.
l've been punched from sheet metal.
My ridges have been rimmed
and bevelled.
But now l have
two small holes in me.
So there's something else
l want to tell you.
Right before
everything went black,
you want to know the very last
thing that entered my mind?
      
WOMAN:
Why not? Because there are
a lot of things that you'd be doing.
Just like playing tennis.

But l mean, hey, l'll take it.
Thank you so much!

Nice to meet you, John.

Y'all have a good night.
Yeah, thanks. l was
in the water for that.
l was seriously
getting it for you.
      
RANDY: This guy's crazy.
JOHN: Yeah, no, l swear l'm not.

long stretches of boring.
Occasional flashes
of scary.
Full moon tonight.
Do you ever notice
how big the moon is
when it's rising?
And how little it gets
when it's up in the sky.
JOHN:
You know, that's just
your perspective.
it actually doesn't matter
where it is in the sky or
where you are in the world
if you hold your hand up
and close one of your eyes.
it뭩 never bigger
than your thumb.

Where'd you learn that?
JOHN:

Somewhere.
JOHN:

Wow.
You just-- You just

That's very impressive.
Very primal.
But you're still not

l fear that as well.
l should probably

l think it's probably
too late for that.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Yeah. No, you're welcome.
      
Would you want to maybe

Tomorrow night

l don't think you're

Hey, Pop.

l want you to meet.

Hey.

This is Savannah.
Hi.
it뭩 nice to meet you,
Mr. Tyree.
Um... Hm.
Wow.
Wow.
He-- This is my--
He collects coins.
He, um-- it뭩 kind of
like his big hobby.
This is amazing.
You have so many coins.
How did you get started
in all this?
Uh... Uh...
Through John, actually.
But it's not his
thing anymore.
Hey, you know, we should
probably maybe go.
SAVANNAH: What is this coin?
MR. TYREE: Uh...
That's a-- That's a
Sacagawea mule.
it뭩 actually...
Wow, it's a mule.
Do you want to see some more?
Absolutely, yes, if you don't mind.
Put this, uh,
glove on then.
Thanks.
MR. TYREE:
This is a humorous one.
This is a satirical coin.
This is massive.
Yeah, William Jennings Bryan,
when he ran for president,
he was-- He believed in--
No, don't turn it over.
Leave it here.
Do you remember that he had
the free silver policy. You remember.
Oh.
And McKinley was his opponent
and he's-- Wait, here.
Now see, that's a real silver dollar.
That's the size of a silver dollar.
And McKinley said that
Wow. That's so weird.
if Bryan had his way,
then the silver dollars
would be that big. Yeah.
That's amazing.
Can you imagine
No.
walking around with that
in your pocket?
SAVANNAH: That's really funny.
MR. TYREE: That's humorous.
Now, these--
Pop, we can't do
this right now. l got to--
We can't be here all night.
l have-- l have some
to show you.
This is fascinating.
MR. TYREE:
These are all matched in colour.
      
l had fun tonight.
l like your dad.
You shouldn't be
too hard on him.
He loves you.
l can tell
even if you can't.
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
Wait, Savannah. l mean...
So l guess l'll see
you soon, then?
l'll see you soon, then.
Where you
been all day?
l've been busy.
You're on
spring break.
You're supposed
to be lounging on
the beach all day.
You're not supposed
to be busy doing things.
l want to show you
something.
SAVANNAH:
The family that lived here,
their home was severely
damaged by the hurricane.
JOHN:
What, so now you're rebuilding it?
SAVANNAH:
Yup. Well, not just me.
You're starting to
make me a little nervous.
Why am l starting
to make you nervous?
Because l'm starting to
think you might be too
good of a person for me.
Oh. No, l'm not
that good of a person.
You're sneaking off every
day to do manual labour
on a house for charity.
On your spring break.
Yeah, you're right.
it뭩 selfish, really,
me being this generous.
But no, seriously.
You don't drink, you don't smoke.
Nope. Nope.
You probably don't sleep around.
Absolutely not.
Mm.
Okay, look, you
got to have a fault.
l do.
Okay, care to enlighten me?
l curse.
No.
l do.
No, you don't.
Yes, l do.
l haven't heard you.
Well, that's because
it's in my mind.
There's a never-ending
stream of curse words
that l'm thinking at all times.
Okay, fine, just say one then.
No, l can't tell you
because it's filthy.
Right.
Yeah.
Okay, all right. Fair enough.
No, l have faults, John.
Trust me, l have plenty
of them. You'll see.
l hope so.
SAVANNAH:
We have to be finished with
this entire house in three weeks.
Hope that
actually happens.
Um, these are going to
be the bedrooms,
the parents' room,
the boys' rooms,
two boys, 7 and 9.
Uh, living room
and the bathroom.
And then this
is the kitchen.
{THUNDER RUMBLING}
This is the best room because
the mom's a really good cook.
We're going to make
it really beautiful
with white tile floors
and tiles on
the countertops,
and there's going to be a roof.
Ah!
{LAUGHS}
Here, John, come here.
A roof would definitely be good.
it뭩 going to be like this,
but it's going to be everywhere.
it뭩 the only cover
we have.
Nice, we're going to
be here for a while.
Where'd you get
your scar?
Hm?
That one?
Oh. Um...
A knife fight.
it was five years ago,
we were really drunk
and the guy went for my eye.
That's terrible.
Why? He missed.
{CHUCKLES}
The way people
act around you,
the way they treated you
at that restaurant...
it뭩 like they're scared of you.
They're not scared of me.
They might be scared
of who l used to be.
And who is that?
Somebody different?
So when did you change?
When you went into the Army?
Yeah. Yeah,
l mean, partly yeah.
And the other part?
l don't know,
l'm still working on that.
So you used to be tough.
And maybe you
still are a little bit.
Mm-hm.
You don't scare me, John.
No?
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm?
Well, you scare me.

it may take a while for these

We've already been deployed
out on a mission.
STONE: Come on, soldier,
move it, move it. Let's go!
The problem is we can't exactly
use the local postal system here.
And there's no such thing
as Internet connection.
So l have to send everything
from here out by airmail.
Can you get this out for me?
Yeah. Yeah.
Don't lose it, all right?
Yeah, l gotcha.
Unfortunately, l'm not allowed
to say exactly where here is.
So all l can tell you is that
the place that we've been sent
makes me miss America
very much.
And the lack of anything
resembling an ocean
makes me miss Charleston.
And everything around me
makes me miss you.
We move around a lot. So letters
tend to come late and out of order.
We may want to number our
letters from here on out, though,
just so we know which order
we wrote them in.

All right, let's see here.
Not for me. Not for me.
Not for me.
And not for me.

how horses are somehow

l want to open up
a summer camp for autistic kids.
l've never seen him
act like this before.
ALAN:
Are you hungry?
A place where they can ride horses
as much as they want.
Are you hungry?
For at least once in their life,
a place where they won't
have to worry about a thing.
What do you think?
Pipe dream, huh?
JOHN:
No, it's not a pipe dream.
Erget. Merry Christmas.
John, to a Mr. John Tyree.
Shut up, man.
Seven?
Stop moving around.
Can l keep this one?
JOHN:
Letter Number 33.
Dear Savannah, the good news is
we've been sent somewhere new.
Although l can't tell you
where that is either.
The bad news is, this place actually
makes me miss the old place.
But it's a full moon here tonight,
which makes me think of you.
Because l know that no matter what
l'm doing, no matter where l am,
this moon will always be
the same size as yours.
SAVANNAH:
Dear John,
most nights l fall asleep
worrying about you.
Wondering where
you may be out there.
Summer's almost over
and l wanted to see him
before l went back to school.
Hey.
l made you a pie.
He made me dinner.
it was Sunday so we had lasagne.
And l got him talking about his coins.
So we had plenty of conversation.
This one is kind of a cull,
a coin that's in really bad shape.
Worthless to most collectors.
But not to you.
No, not to me.
What is your
favourite coin?
Out of all the coins that
you have, what is your
absolute favourite coin?
Do you have one?
MR. TYREE:
'Seventy-eight Jefferson mule.
SAVANNAH: Wow.
MR. TYREE: That'd be my favourite.
Definitely.
Why? ls it worth
the most?
Well, it's worth a lot,
not the most.
But, you know...
What's the story behind it?
Um...
Here's one...
So l'll ask you instead, John,
wherever you may be.
      
JOHN:
Dear Savannah, only because
l promised to tell you everything.
Thank you.
When l was 7 years old,
l bought an ice cream cone.
On the way home, l noticed one of
the pennies wasn't actually a penny.
l don't know.
{CHUCKLES}
l don't know.
Never seen anything like it.
Did you find this, son? Huh?
Yeah?
No, it's a mule.
it뭩 a what?
A mule. An error coin.
Every now and then
they make a mistake,
batch accidentally
slips through, this thing,
head's a nickel,
tail's a penny.
Thing's a mule.
Really more of a novelty
than anything.
Remember the horse sense
you were talking about?
--the kid found it
l will buy it anyway.
Twenty bucks. Huh?
No, thank you.
Now, wait a minute.
Hang on.
Hey, sir. Sir, let me take
another look at that real quick.
John, let's go.
l'll be damned.
Do you know what this is?
No.
Look at that.
That's your coin.
You want my advice?
Dad to Dad?
Keep it.
Hold on to it.
Pass it down to your son.
Let him pass it to his son
and on and on and on,
and l'll tell you what,
years from now...
you're going to have
something worth a whole
lot more than $4000.
l promise you.
Hey.
Do you want to keep it?
{CHUCKLES}
Good for you.
Thank you. Thank you.
At first l loved chasing after
those mules with my father.
We finally had something
to talk about.
You know, something
we could do together.
But he became obsessed with them.
You know how he is.
And then l became a teenager
and you know how l am.
All the way up to Wooster
for another coin show.
l'm just--
No, l'm not doing that.
You're going to one
every weekend now.
Oh, that's good.
l love warm milk.
That's nice.
You spend all of our
money on coins.
Get a fricking fridge
that works.
Eventually he stopped talking
about coins with me altogether.
And then when that happened,
we found there wasn't all that
much left to talk about.

So l've been briefing him in

With solid tactical training,

All right, You know what?
You look like you could

l'll grab one for you.
Yes, thank you.

What's he doing here?
He's here because l invited him.
His family lives just up the street.

He's really not that bad

Here you go.

it's not going to kill you.

Be right back.
Look, l feel like we got off on the

lf l would have known that
Savannah was actually
going to stay with you,
you know, l wouldn't have
treated you that way.
in all seriousness,
l'm sorry.
Fair enough.
lf you need anything and,
uh... Enjoy yourself.
Right.
So this is him.
Yup. No tough-guy
routine from you, Dad.
Routine? l bench press

Nice to meet you, Mr. Curtis.
But l think that Tim here
might have already beat
you to the punch.
He said he'd rough me up
if ever l hurt your daughter.
l was very convincing too.

Well, cheers, son.
Glad you could join us.
Thank you, sir.
Billy! You actually showed up!
See, hard part's over.
Whoa.
Good to see you again, John.
How you doing, Tim?

how are you doing?
Good.

So l'll tell her you said hello.

l will.
Alan, remember
what we talked about?
JOHN:
Another vacation?
Yeah.
Alan ever ask
about her?
Yeah, he does.
l just don't know
what to say.
Hey, look, l'm not a father.
So...
You know, l'm really in no position
to give you advice at all.
When l was a kid,
l waited around every day
hoping that today
would finally be the day
that my mom
would come home.
l waited around 1 5 years.
So l know how painful
it might have been for
my dad to
just tell me the truth.
But it would have saved me
a lot of waiting around.
You know?
Well, l guess if the worst thing
you can say about your father
is he tried to protect you
too much...
then that's a pretty good
father, isn't it?
l'm sorry.
You're John, right?
Savannah's John?
Yes, sir.
l want to thank you
for what you're doing.
Know that our prayers are with you.
l just hope that whatever happens,
it'll be over soon. So you boys
can come home safe and sound.

Oh, it won't be over anytime soon.
Afghanistan will just be

He's right, you know.
Pretty soon they're

Have you already done it?
Have you already

No.
But you decided
that you're going to?
Do l have a say?
Do l have a say in this?
You don't understand.
Don't ever tell me l don't understand.
Leave me alone,

Please.
What do you...?
What do you want from me?

Just tell me what you want
from me. Because-- l mean,
you want me to quit?

how we got here.
l don't know
what happened.

l want to stay here.
l just want to stay right
here with you as long
as l possibly can.
You're just all that matters, okay?
You're all that matters to me.
l'm trying to figure out what
the right thing is to do and
l don't know what that is.
l don't have any fricking idea
how to get there. l just--

Right before
l blacked out?
Coins.
Suddenly l was
l was on that tour
of the U.S. Mint.
l was listening to the guide
explain how coins are made.
How they're punched out
of sheet metal and how
they're rimmed and bevelled.
How they're stamped
and cleaned.
And how each and every batch
of coins are personally examined
just in case any have
slipped through with
the slightest imperfection.
Do you remember
that, Dad?
l mean, do you remember
that trip to Philadelphia we took?
Well, that's what popped
into my head.
l'm a coin of the
United States Army.
And l was minted
in the year 1980.
l've been punched
from sheet metal.
l've been stamped and cleaned.
And my edges have been
rimmed and bevelled.
But now l have
two small holes in me.
So l'm no longer
in perfect condition.''
How about it, Dad?
You know, we're just
a couple of culls here, huh?
''But there's one--
There's one more thing
that l want to tell you too.
After l got shot, you know,
right before l blacked out.

in good hands.
{SIGHS}
She still loves you,
you know.
Why is it black?
it뭩 plain as day, you can
see it all over her face.
l wish that
weren't the case,
but she's never looked at me
the way she used to look at you.
You should know that.
SAVANNAH:
Be careful, Alan.
He still loves
those horses, huh?
Yeah, he'll be out
there till bedtime.
l got to get him
out of that hospital.
He needs to come home.
There's a company in Texas
with an experimental drug.
That might help.
But the insurance companies
don't pay for it, of course.
My parents sold their
beach house a year ago.
Which was a godsend.
We've done a few fundraisers.
{SIGHS}
But l never would have guessed
that we would run out so fast.
Stay for dinner, okay?
So you drink now.
Just a glass or two at dinner.
Tim got me started
a couple years ago.
Why are you looking at me
like that?
What do you mean?
How am l looking at you?
Differently.
l don't know, how do you
want me to look at you?
You're different.
Oh...
l don't know--
l don't know why l came here.
l mean, what are we doing?
We're sitting here and we're
eating and we're talking,
but no one's actually
saying anything.
What do you want me to say?
What do you want to talk about?
Why didn't you call?
Why didn't you call me?
l mean, did l not deserve
any more explanation than
that letter?
You couldn't have
called me?
You couldn't have given me
some sort of chance to,
like, change your mind?
Don't you think
you owed me that?
l couldn't.
You couldn't?
You thought that little
of me that you couldn't
have just called me.
Why?
Because l couldn't.
Give me an answer.
Why? Why not?
Because l couldn't.
l want an answer.
Because just hearing your voice,
l would have changed my mind.
ls that what you
want to hear, John?
ls that what you came
all this way to hear from me?
You think it was
tough out there?
And, what, you think it was
easy for me without you?
You thought that
every single day it wasn't
a goddamn marathon
of my life without you?
Tim was sick.
He was sick and he needed me.
He needed me to help him.
He needed me to help him
with Alan, with everything.
l was alone and l had
no idea what l was doing.
l didn't plan this. l didn't know
that it was going to happen to me.
But it did.
But you don't think l've tried--?
l picked up the phone
a thousand times to try
to call you.
You think that l really
want to be standing here
in front of you like this?
{SOBBING}
l had no choice.
l know.
      
l saved every single
one of them.
You've been so many places.
Mm-hm.
l think the yellow envelopes
are from Africa or something.
Really?
Mm-hm.
l even have your first,
your very first letter to me.
Tim's water bill.
{CHUCKLES}
Hmm.
{LAUGHS}
Sorry.
it뭩 okay.
SAVANNAH:
Hope you have more
where that came from.
      
l'm going to put
a pot of coffee on.
{SIGHS}
{SIGHS}
l should go.
l'll see you soon, then?
Say it back.
When l say it,
you say it.
Remember?
John?
Just say it.
Goodbye, Savannah.
      
{CAR ENGINE STARTS}
JOHN:
l don't think you remember me.
But l believe you knew
my father, Bill Tyree.
Oh, yeah, of course
l did. Yeah.
l haven't seen him
in a while, though.
How is he?
Uh, he recently passed.
l'm sorry.
l think you might've offered
to buy his coin collection
one time. ls that right?
Sure did.
More than once.
Just out of curiosity,
how much do you think
a collection like his is worth?
Phew. A collection that big?
l don't know, l'd have to see it.
Look, l only got
about one condition.
All the mules,
they got to stay together.
l don't care, you can
sell them as a set or
keep them for yourself.
But they have
to stay together.
You're really truly going
to sell me all his coins?
Yes, sir.
All but one.
JOHN:
This comes up nickel, we're going to
set up right here. We got shade.
it comes up penny, we'll be up
on the ridge. We got visibility.
That'd be penny side.
All right, let's go to the ridge.
SOLDIER:
Sergeant.
JOHN:
Thank you.
SAVANNAH:
Dear John,
      
it's been almost five years
since l wrote a letter with
an actual pen
But l thought maybe l could
write you now and tell you
all that's happened
since l saw you last.
A few weeks
after you showed up here,
Tim received
an anonymous donation.
A donation that was enough
to give him
what the insurance
companies wouldn't:
The problem with time,
l've learned,
whether it's those first two weeks
l got to spend with you
or those final two months
l got to spend with him,
l have no idea where you are
out there in the world, John.
But l understand that l lost the right
to know these things long ago.
l know one thing
to be as true as it ever was.
      떰
