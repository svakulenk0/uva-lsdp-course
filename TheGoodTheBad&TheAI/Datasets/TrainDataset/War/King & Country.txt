Here dead lie we
because we did not choose
to live and shame the kind
from which we sprung;
Life' after all'
is nothing much to lose
Though young men think it is,
and we were young.
Ha' ha, ha. What does
this remind you of?
Remind you of anything?
You know when this war's over
I think I'll get me
a job in the sewer;
well it's the same smell,
the same company.
The perfect soldier.
Aye, the perfect soldier.
Loved his country.
Killed rats.
- Killed lice.
Went without food.
- Without drink.
Without sleep.
- Without
Went over the top.
Killed the Kaiser, won the war.
Home again.
- Honorable discharge.
Fat pension.
- From his grateful country.
Women waiting for him.
- Children fondle him.
Liquor is free for him.
- He sleeps in the sun.
Remind you of anything?
Ha, ha, ha.
I suppose they think
I've let 'em down, Corp.
No.
I reckon I'M get a fair trial.
Aye.
It'll come out all right.
Aye, course it'll
come out all right.
Well I'm sorry this lob had lo
be wished on you, Charles.
It's not your fault.
If we weren't moving up so soon
I suppose it could all
be a bit more formal.
That would make it all
the more futile, wouldn“: it?
What? Well he is
on trial for his life.
That doesn't make
him original we're all
on trial for our lives.
The only thing that makes him
original is that he's failed.
Failed as a man
and as a soldier.
The whole blasted
thing's a waste of time.
If a dog breaks its back,
you don't sit around
chatting all day, you shoot it.
Er' excuse me, sir.
- Oh yes, come on.
What er what were
you like as a child?
The same.
Is he in there?
- Yes sir.
Er, might I have a
word with you, sir?
He's no idea what
could happen to him sir.
At least, he don't give
no sign of knowing.
I suppose he's bound to know'
he's bound to know what he did;
he's bound to know
what could happen to him.
Have you been talking to him?
Yes sir' a bit.
I know it"s laid down
we shouldn't.
Shall I come sir?
Is it necessary?
No sir.
My name's Hargreaves.
- Yes sir, I know you, sir.
Do you?
- Trores Wood, sir.
Worlencourt, sir, as well.
How long have you been out here?
Fourteen' sir.
Best pan of three years.
You know of course
that you are entitled
to the help of a
defending officer.
Oh yes sir. Soldier's Friend.
I suppose I can be as much
use to you as anybody else,
subject of course
to your acceptance.
No objection?
Oh no, sir. I'd, er I'd
like to thank you, sir.
It's not as if you
have to do it, sir.
Do you mind
standing to attention
when you are
speaking to an officer.
I didn't think it
mattered in here, sir.
Well it does matter.
Pull yourself together,
will you?
Now you're Hamp, Arthur James,
Age'?
- 23, sir.
Occupation?
I I'm a soldier, sir.
I mean in civilian life.
Oh, er
I had a trade, sir, Boot maker.
Hand-made boots.
I come from Islington.
D'you know it, sir?
Yes I know it.
- Yeah?
Were you were you
a cobbler all your life?
Since I left school, sir.
- At what age?
Twelve, sir.
Started young, as they say.
Were you a good one?
Oh yeah' yeah.
A good cobbler, yeah.
Me father and grandfather were
cobblers before I was, see.
Me grandfather, he started it.
- Are you married?
Er' yes, sir.
- Any children?
Yes. ' sir
- How many?
One, sir. A little boy.
Do you understand why I'm
asking you these questions?
You know best, sir.
AH right, stand at ease.
- Yes, sir.
L, er...
I I'd better ask you some
questions about your
about your home life.
Home life?
Well, we we never really
had a proper home life, sir.
Er, we always lived
with her mother.
Did you?
Were you on
sit down, sit down.
- Oh' thank you, sir.
Were you on good
terms with your wife?
Has somebody said
something to you?
Would you mind
answering my question?
About the wife?
- Yes.
She's took up with somebody
else that's what I got told.
Who told you?
- I got a letter.
A kind friend?
- Yeah, Len.
I see.
- Len Wﬂson.
Lives just a couple
of doors away.
Well that'll do for mitigating
circumstances anyway.
Sir?
A reason.
An understandable reason.
- Oh.
Did you keep the letter?
- No sir, I hadn't thought.
Did you, er
did you er did you mention
this letter to anyone else?
Yes sir, I did. Yeah.
Er, Willie Bryson
Private Bryson in our platoon.
Did you know him, sir?
Er er no, I don’t think I do.
Oh. Yeah, he got killed,
here at Paschendaele.
Er, did this
er, did this trouble
with your wife
have anything to do with the
with er with what
you're accused of doing?
Er, no. sir.
I never thought of it.
Do you reckon maybe
it was a reason
even if I never thought of it?
- I don't know.
Thai's for you to tell me.
Oh.
I see.
This kind of story's
so often true that, er
well you you could be lying.
And I have to believe you
before I can defend you,
do you understand that?
You can believe me, sir.
It'll come out all right, sir.
Why did you volunteer?
- King and Country.
Sir?
Mm. They dared me.
Who dared you?
- The wife and her mother.
They never thought I'd go.
Yeah, I reckon it was that
more than anything else.
I wanted to surprise them.
They got a surprise
and all when I told them.
And of course er
we..we didn't know what it
was going to be like' did we'?
Well, I... I didn't
think about it too much
but I suppose you.. you reckon
to yourself in my kind of life.
Well, it can't be much
worse than this, you know.
Not you. sir. My sort
and most of the lads.
But we was wrong.
Up there well
H's worse than
anything, isn't it?
It's no worse for you
than anyone else.
I know that, sir, I know that.
I'm only talking about it
'cause you're asking me.
Go on.
Well, when I volunteered we
didn't know any better, did we?
What d'you mean by that?
Well, just a manner
of speaking, sir.
You'll have to
learn to be careful
of your manner of speaking.
Yes, sir.
Funny thing is
the fellows I come outwith
do you know, there's none
of them left except me
Loos. “
Loos that was the first one.
It was long side, that one.
Trones Wood
Gommycore
Worlencourt
Yeah.
And now this one here.
Passchendaole
worse than anything.
Have you been wounded?
- Not properly, sir.
I was bleeding a few times and
there was one time I
got sent down to a G.C.S.
It was nothing much.
They sent me back the next day.
Of course you hear
of fellows wishing
they could lose an arm or a leg.
Same as everybody else.
I've heard of
some of the lads that have
tried it on themselves.
Have you tried it'?
Sir?
- Have you tried n?
Oh, no sir, no
Me and Willie er, Bryson,
we was thinking of trying
it once, but we never did.
It... it wasn't long after that,
that Willie's number come up.
When? Here?
Oh oh sorry, sir.
I'm sorry. I've got
to go someplace.
Corporal!
Sir.
- Latrines.
Yes sir.
- Go on.
Come on Hamp.
Right wheel.
Sergeant, get the rest
of your platoon outside
with their gear for de-lousing.
Come on, out.
- Right, sir.
Gear for de-lousing.
All out for de-lousing!
Come on!
Come on outside for de-lousing.
Outside with all your
gear for de-lousing.
Come on, out!
Captain Hargreaves,
prisoner's friend.
Prisoner's friend. A fair trial.
A fair trial and a quick death.
- Very funny.
Didn't you think it was funny?
Not funny if you're
in Hamp's shoes.
Ready for you, sir.
I mm you he was
a strange one, sir.
Attend to that, will you?
I wouldn”: be in Hamp's shoes.
If I'd done it, I wouldn't
have got caught.
Right, get yer
picks and shovels.
I've got a }ob for yer.
They still hanging
around here, sir?
Thanks for the smoke, sir.
Did you expect
to get away with it'?
Well, I wasn't really
thinking about it, sir,
one way or the other.
I just couldn't
stand it anymore.
It wasn't the first time, sir.
- What?
Well, I I nearly
did it once before.
I mean I thought of it.
Time of Worlencourt.
I got sent back
on a water party.
I I was thinking
about getting away
but an M.P. got his
eye on me, so I didn't.
And that was all?
- Yes, sir.
Supposing the others had, er
cleared of-f and left you on your
own at Loos or Trone's Wood?
I don't think it could have
been much worse, sir.
All right then,
we'll forget about that.
Tell me about the the last time,
the time you said you
couldn't stand it anymore.
What about that?
Well, the time this really
started going in my head,
I got blown into a shell hole.
Two of the lads pulled
me out with their riﬂes.
Well' I.. I..
I'd seen it happen
to a bloke a couple
of days before.
He slipped off the duck
boards into the hole,
you see, and he's bobbing
up and down in the mud
you know, like an
egg boiling in water,
with his pack on and everything.
Well I didn't help him,
nobody did. It's laid down.
So of course, when
I gets m the mud
I thought that was my lot, see.
I was going to drown
in it, like he did.
Sucked into it,
fighting it, drowning in it.
Oh, after that I couldn't
stand it anymore.
But the battalion was relieved.
You came back here for a rest.
- Yes, sir.
And you waited ten
days until you went?
Yes sir.
- Why?
Like I said sir, I can't
say it any different.
I couldn't stand it anymore.
- What, even out of battle?
It didn't matter
where I was, sir.
Any place I could hear guns.
There's never anywhere
where you can't hear them.
Yes sir.
Mr' Webb, he knew, he knew.
He he gave me extra rum.
Did you say anything
to him about it?
Not much, there wasn't
nothing I could expect
a gentleman in his
position to do, sir.
What he did,
giving me extra rum,
wouldn't have made any
difference to what I did,
I knew I wasn't
going to go back.
You mean you planned it?
No, sir, no.
I didn't have a plan.
I haven”: got the sense, have I?
Maybe one time I would
have had the sense but er
no, it's like being dead, sir.
Why did you wait ten days?
I don't know sir.
I didn't have a plan.
I went to the M.O.
that time, yeah.
And what did Dr. O'Sullivan
say to you'?
He gave me a number
nine sir, for me bowels
I spit it out when
he wasn't looking.
Maybe there was
some sort of medicine
that would have helped
me but one thing I
didn't have any need
of was a number nine.
And did he give you
any other advice'?
Well, he said I'd
got cold feet, sir.
He said I was a soldier and
I should be a bloody soldier.
Mind you' I... I Ididn't
expect any different.
I didn't expect him to say
anything except what he did.
Why did you so?
Well, I thought he might
give me some sort of tonic,
something sir, to
stop me diarrhea,
stop me shaking, help me sleep.
It wouldn't have make any
difference to what I did.
I knew I wasn't going
to go back up the line.
Did you know the
battalion was going
back into the line
before you went?
Yes, sir.
Is that what finally
decided you?
No, sir.
- Then what did decide you'?
I dunno.
I just started walking
walking away from the guns.
Did you know where
you were walking to?
No... no.
After I got a few miles
away from the guns
I got it into my head that
I was making for home,
Islington you know.
Er...
Er. didn't make any sense but
that's what I got in my head.
I must have walked a long
way because I remember
I took me boots off and
me mg toe was kneading.
Then I was in a cart
sitting on some potatoes.
Then I was in a train and
some fellows was er
was was playing cards.
Then I was wanking again.
Then I was
talking to this priest
but he was foreign. I didn't
know what he was talking about.
It... it was like a dream sir.
I... I didn't know
what was really happening
and what wasn't'
Weren't you ever challenged?
Only when they picked me-up.
Not till then'?
- Oh' no no.
Didn't you
hide in ditches and things to
avoid them?
Oh, no, sir. No no.
Did they say anything to you
when they arrested you?
Well, er just about me being a
deserter and I heard one of them
saying to the other about
it being a shooting job.
Nothing else?
Well you see, there's
nobody left in 'A' company
that's been out here as long as
me, sir, so they can't shoot me.
It's likely that you will be
found guilty of desertion.
And I'd be failing in my duty if
I left the least shadow of doubt
in your mind as to
the consequences.
Well I don't reckon
I'll get off, sir, but
they they can't shoot me.
Unless I can convince the court
that you were acting
under extra ordinary strain
at the time when you
committed this crime,
you will almost certainly
be sentenced to death.
This was the first time sir.
Mr. Webb; sir' he said I
hadn't been a bad soldier.
He might say the same
to them if he was asked.
Yes, he might
Yes, I thought that was
worth mentioning, sir.
Can you think of anything else
that was worth mentioning?
Did did I tell you about Willie?
Bryson yes, you
told me about that.
Well, about about when
Willie was was killed?
You told me that
he had been killed.
Well, I don't know
if you can, er
if you can tell them
about something like that.
Well, it's important
for you to tell me.
Well you see, I was alongside
of him when it happened.
Same as many a time before,
five' six yards away.
H wasn't the first time I seen
a man blown to bits of course,
it wasn't even as if Willie
was anything special to me.
Well, just a bit, you know,
because he came
from up our street.
But that's all, I mean
nothing special
One thing about Willie,
it was quick.
I never saw it, sir, I was
five or six yards away
I turns around and old Willie's
nowhere, except over me.
Ooh, I tell you, they had
to get me a new uniform.
This is a
this is a question that I may
have to ask you in court, sir.
I'm going to ask you now,
If they, er were lenient enough
to send you to prison,
could you be relied upon to do
your duty when you come out?
Well I'd try my best. sir.
- I don't mean that.
Could you be relied onto go up
the line, and stay up the line.
I mean that exactly,
nothing, less.
Do you understand me?
- Yes sir.
Well'?
Do I have to tell
you the truth sir?
Could you?
Can you tell me sir?
Can you tell me any
way of being sure?
Prisoner's ready, sir.
Shouldn't take long, sir.
It's a bad business.
Who's in charge of the
er later formalities?
One thing at a time,
Sergeant Manor.
Yes, sir.
Give us a hand with this.
What is it? Horse or mule?
- Pig.
If we was left to ourselves,
we'd all be home in bed
having it, wouldn't we?
I didn't say anything about
- Wouldn't we?
You can't win a war
lying in bed, can you?
No but
- So you do what you're told.
Doesn't make sense.
- That's not our fault, is it?
Keep an eye open: cook.
- Pity to waste it on that lot.
Where's the best bit?
- This bit. Chopper.
Knife.
Dixie.
Right, well now we'll see what
we can do for our officers.
The Brass have gathered.
- How's Hamp?
Oh they've got him all spruced
up like for his wedding.
Cut himself shaving of course.
him;
we just push him over
and watch him sink.
They won't do it.
Do you think they will, sir?
- No. I think he's had it.
I'm afraid he's had his mt.
Are you going to get the silly
bastard off, do you think'?
He thinks so.
- I hope he's right.
I'll shall certainly do my best.
Oh don't misunderstand,
my interest is purely personal.
I don't want my men
used as a firing squad.
And I certainly don't
want to be the
Joe Bloody Soap who
has to shout 'fire"
Why you?
- Oh I'm number one
on the Colonel's Sweat
List at the moment'
I see.
- When it comes to my turn,
I'll perjure myself for
the man if you like.
The truth will do.
Good luck my learned friend.
Prisoner and escort Halt!
By the right turn!
Private Hamp cap off.
Corporal.
Prisoner and escort left turn.
Quick march left.
Left, right
Left wheel
Prisoner and escort halt!
Left turn.
Is that your name and number?
- Yes sir.
Mr Prescott, would
you pass me that?
The accused, no. 873426
Private Hamp' Arthur James,
Soldier of the Regular Forces,
you are charged with
when on active service
er... attempting to desert
His Majesty's Service.
In that you absented
yourself from duty
without orders from
your superior officer,
from approximately 0700 hours
on October 10th this year
at a mace called Jackdaw Tunnel
until October the 11th this year
when you were arrested by
the military police at Calais.
Guilty or not guilty?
- Not guilty, sir.
Speak up.
- Not guilty sir.
Very well.
I have to ask you if you object
to any members of the court?
Myself or either of
these two officers?
I am surprised, sir' that
as convening officer,
you are also president
of the Court Martial.
There are no other
field officers available,
Captain Hargreaves,
I must appoint myself.
Are you making a
formal objection?
No sir.
You may stand at ease,
Private Hamp.
Well sir, I've spoken
to Captain Midgeley
and we've agreed that I won't
dispute the facts of the case.
So all the witnesses will
be called by the defense.
Good. That will save
the Courts time'
I submit that the prisoner
absented himself at a time when,
because of his mental health'
he was not fully
responsible for his actions.
Mental health,
Captain Hargreaves.
Do you mean that
the prisoner is lunatic?
No: sir.
- Or mentally deficient?
No, sir.
There must be hundreds
of thousands of men
who are in an
unhappy mental state
but who have not absented
themselves from their duty.
I realize that sir' fully.
I assure you.
Are you ready for
your first witness?
Yes sir.
Call Corporal Hamilton.
Corporal Hamilton.
- Sir.
Halt
Hold the Book in
your right hand.
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall
give before this court
shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall
give before this court
shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.
Corporal Hamilton,
I believe that
you apprehended the prisoner?
- Yes sir.
What did he say to you?
- Not much, sir. Only
Well he tried to tell us he was
going on leave, of course.
Yes.
A soldier going on
leave is required
to carry with him a full pack
and equipment, is he not?
- Yes sir.
And the prisoner was carrying?
Gas helmet, riﬂe
and bandolier, sir.
Wouldn”: have stood much
chance of getting on board
a leave ship in that
gear, would he?
No, sir.
Rather a silly story, wasn't it?
Yes, sir.
Then how do you account for it?
Well sir, he could
have, for all I know
he could have been just stupid.
Gives us the day off,
though' doesn't it'?
I'm not going up to the front
and leave that bloody
bastard behind me alive.
Bloody, bloody rats!
Corporal Hamilton,
I presume that during
the course of your duty
you have arrested
other deserters,
of other men who have absented
themselves from service?
Yes, sir. Quite a few, sir.
Did any of them behave in
the same way as this prisoner?
Much the same, sir.
In particular, did some of
them, to use your own words,
did some of them appear
to you to be stupid'?
Or behaving as if
they were dazed?
Yes sir' I suppose so.
In short, was there anything
remarkable or extraordinary
about this prisoner
compared with others?
Well, if there had have been
something extraordinary
you would have thought
about it, wouldn“: you?
The thing that surprised me sir,
was how he got as far as us.
By rights he shouldn't
have had a hope.
He must've been through
places thick with patrols
like Poperinghe and that.
Perhaps he wasn't quite
as simple as he seemed.
No, sir. I didn't mean
- After all, he did
get very close to an
embarkation point, didn't he?
That's all Corporal, no more
questions. Thank you, sir.
Look at that!
There must be dozens
of them in there,
and too full to be nippy.
Shall I jump on it?
- No!
Right. When I say 'Now'
thump the belly.
Now!
Captain O'Sullivan,
do you remember
the prisoner reporting
sick to you on
or about October 8th
of this year?
On the 7th, yes. I looked it up.
Of what did he complain?
I remember quite clearly.
He complained of nerves.
- Nerves.
He didn't tell you he that
he was finding it
impossible to sleep'?
He may have.
Yes, I believe he did.
But you didn't take
this very seriously?
No, ifs not uncommon.
It certainly isn't uncommon
for me to be told such things.
You mean you didn't believe him?
Oh I didn't say that.
Every Medical Officer hears
this kind of thing
five or six times a day.
Did you believe this man?
' Why r-wot?
It seems a permissible question.
- Why not'?
Why didn't you believe him
when he said he couldn't sleep?
I didn't say
I didn't believe that.
Very well. Of what other
symptoms did he complain?
Well, he said he
was off his food.
Said he was feeling a bit shaky.
- Shaky.
Uncontrollable bouts
of trembling?
I don't know about
"uncontrollable?
You don'! know about it but
did you bother to find out?
Are you challenging
my competence?
I don't want to interfere with
your defense, Captain Hargreaves
but must you attack the witness?
It's not Captain O'Sullivan's
competence
which is at stake, sir,
it's this man's life.
You said you didn't believe him;
what didn't you believe?
Oh dammit, Charlie,
I knew what he was after.
Did this man lie to you,
and if so what did he say?
I knew what he wanted'
to be sent down the line.
Did he say so?
- Did he what?
Did he ask to be
relieved from duty?
Not in so many words,
of course he didn't.
And er how long did
this interview last with him?
Five minutes ten minutes.
And after that you lost
interest in the man'?
Well what do you
expect me to do?
I haven”: got time for
everyone's emotional problems.
But you were sure
that an interview
for five or ten minutes was
sufficient for this case?
Yes.
- Why were you so sure?
Experience. My own judgment,
of course experience.
And you usually prescribe
the same treatment?
More or Mess. More or less.
Laxative pills.
A good dean out
never hurt anybody.
Is that the only relief you can
offer a man, laxative pills?
I'll prescribe one
for you in a minute.
Captain O'Sullivan,
were laxative pills in the
slightest degree relevant
to what was wrong with this man?
There was nothing wrong
with him and I told him so
Did you? What did you say?
I talked to him man to man.
I told him he wasn't the first
soldier to feel a bit jumpy.
I told him he'd be alright,
back to normal
I told him to try to eat,
to try to get some sleep.
Well what else could I say?
I told him to pull
himself together.
Has the incidence
of medical reports
of this sort been
growing recently?
I haven't got
time for statistics.
Or diagnoses, it seems.
- No. No, no, no.
What are the symptoms
of shell-shock?
Shell-shock is a
different matter altogether.
Is there an exact moment
in the life of a soldier
before which he is not
suffering from shell-shock
and after which he is?
An exact boundary about which no
two doctors will ever disagree?
An exact boundary
on the one side
of which a man is
required by Army law
to "pull himself together. "
Or on the other if he cannot,
is liable lo be shot as
a criminal. Is there?
This has nothing whatever to
do with what we're all here for.
I must say Captain Hargreaves,
I agree with that'
Do you sir?
Then what are we here for?
A mock trial'?
That remarks entirely improper,
Captain Hargreaves.
I apologize, sir.
Proceed.
Does the term 'shell-shock'
have an exact medical meaning?
Yes, of course it has.
And a 'five or
ten minute' examination
is quite sufficient time
in your estimation
to judge whether a man is or is
not suffering from shell-shock?
It is not my job to
maintain a Bedlam.
God knows you of all people
should realize I've got
no time for such rubbish.
Do you expect me to heave
wounded soldiers to die
while I cross question cowards?
What I am asking is
is there not a borderline?
This is not a borderline
case of anything,
how many times have
I got to tell you?
This was a case of cold feet,
funk, miserable funk,
nothing more or less.
Are you sure?
- Yes'
I ask you most earnestly,
are you absolutely sure?
How could a man
responsible for his actions
do such a hopeless.
Desperately stupid
thing as this man?
When they found him,
he was trying to walk
home to England.
He might just as well have tried
to clear a German
trench single-handed.
Is it not obvious to you
that this man had lost
possession of himself?
You've made your point,
Captain Hargreaves.
Have you any more questions
for Captain O'Sullivan?
No sir.
Captain Midgeley.
- Er, yes, sir, if you please.
Captain O'Sullivan, have
any of the Defending Officer's
questions altered the conclusion
you came to about the prisoner
when he reported to
you on October the 7th?
No, not in the slightest.
In view of the speculation
we have heard'
will you now tell the
court in your own words
what that conclusion was?
- Yes'
I found the prisoner
fit for duty,
provided he was
kept under discipline
and discouraged
from malingering.
And there's nothing you wish
to add to your judgment now
by way of qualification?
Nothing whatever. He's
proved me right' hasn't he'?
And that's all there
is to say about it.
He did tum and run, didn't he?
Thank you, Captain O'Sullivan.
Were you in the area
between our billet
and the cookhouse
at 1600 hours today?
Yes, he admits he was in
the area between our billet
and the cookhouse
at 1500 hours today.
Right Did you or did you not
crawl up to Private Sparrow
and take a bite out
of his earhole?
No he did not crawl
up the Private Sparrow
and take a bite
out of his earhole.
Right. Now one last question,
if you had been
in our billet today,
would you have done
a thing like that?
No, he's not that sort of a rat.
Captain Midgley, would you like
to cross-examine the accused?
You've been telling a lot of
bloody hes' haven'! you'?
No, no, I haven't been
telling a lot of bloody lies.
You're just an ordinary rat
who only eats dead ﬂesh, mm?
Mm, I'm just a normal rat.
Well then, if you're
just a normal rat
who only eats dead ﬂesh why,
when all the other rats were
coming out of the front end,
what were you doing
coming out of the back end'?
Oh, he's crying.
- Ah
and after that his
nerve had gone?
Absolutely.
I imagine there were
others of your men in
a similar condition at that
time; were there not?
Well he must have been
in a worse way
than any of the others, sir.
But we dent know that he
was in any worse condition
than his comrades;
we only know what he
decided to do about it.
With respect sir, he
did not 'decide' to do it-
if you'll let me carry on..
- Continue.
Was the prisoner popular
in his platoon?
Oh yes. He always
shared anything he had,
and he's the nearest
thing we've got left
to a founder member, of course.
And he...
Yes?
Well I was just going to say..
I don't supose it
matters.. but er..
He brewed a damn
good cup of tea.
Was he a good soldier
before this happened?
First-class.
Near enough. Not a born
soldier' but first-class.
And you were surprised when
you heard that he'd absconded?
Oh yes I was.
From what you know of him,
you believe he'd have
to be a little unhinged
to do what he did?
Yes.. I do.
Thank you.
No more questions sir.
- Captain Midgley?
First-class soldier.
- Yes.
His record Is singularly blank.
Neither good nor bad.
His principal talent as soldier
seems to be in staying alive.
Well, surely we're not trying a
man for staying alive, are we?
The War hasn't got to
that stage, has it?
Mr. Webb.
Hargreaves here is
the sole survivor
of an assault on the Somme.
They didn't try him for that.
You'll confine yourself to
answering questions, Mr. Webb.
I beg your pardon sir.
Mr. Webb, about this
mental unhinging
did you see any actual
sign of it yourself?
Well, it depends.
- I mean if it had it surely
would have been your duty to see
that something was done about it
wouldn't it?
Did the idea occur to you
before he went absent?
No.. but he could have been ill
in his mind even if I
didn't see it beforehand.
Can you offer any
evidence that he was?
Er well I don't blame him. We
all get the wind up sometimes.
I much prefer a man
to boll beforehand
rather than crack up under fire
and endanger a whole platoon.
Mr. Webb.
Isn't it true to say,
however much we may regret it,
however much we may sympathize,
isn't it true to say
that this man
simply allowed his fear
to become his master?
There's more in it than that.
I ask you again.
Can you recall any evidence
to support what you say?
I've said what I believe.
Thank you, Mr. Webb. No more
questions, thank you, sir'
Very well.
- Sir.
Got it. Got it!
Broke its bloody back!
It's as though the Devil's
got hold of me legs
He's pulling me down.
I'm not even wounded.
Pm not even wounded but I'm
going to be drowned in the mud.
Oh, something had
it in for me, I knew that.
Did this idea that the
Devil was after you
did it stay in your mind after
you'd been rescued from the mud?
Not in the same way, sir. no.
So it wasn't the Devil.
Then why did you run away?
I didn't run sir. I walked.
I just started walking.
I dunno why.
It's it's not true to say is it
that you deliberately
decided to desert
that you deliberately decided
and hoped to gel away with it'?
I wasn't really thinking
about it, sir.
No. I know you weren't
thinking about it.
No but I was hoping they
wouldn't get me, of course.
But you really weren't
you weren't clearly thinking of
anything at the time, were you?
I just wanted to getaway
from the guns, sir.
Had you any idea
where you were going?
No sir not really.
I just wanted to get left
alone for a bit, that's all.
Private Hamp
you say you wanted
to be left alone for a bit.
Does that mean you intended
to return to the battalion?
I don't know sir.
That's because you
you don't remember anything
very dearly, isn't it?
That's right sir. Yeah.
You had no clear man or
reason in your mind, did you?
I just started going, sir.
I, ya know I couldn't
help myself.
Well
like you told me to say, sir,
I was acting under
extraordinary strain
I er... I er, can't think of
anything else sir.
Is it all right if I ask
you a question, sir?
Yes, carry on.
Well, I, I'd sooner
you tell them sir.
You know more about it than me.
All right.
Any more questions,
Captain Harreavcs?
No, thank you sir.
Captain Midgley.
Private Hamp,
did you know you were doing
wrong when you deserted?
If anyone'd tried to stop
me I'd have stayed, sir.
Well didn't you wait until you'd
made sure that there was nobody
thereto stop you'?
No, er, well I think
I was just lucky, sir.
That's very much
a matter of opinion.
Look' what I really
want to know is this.
You did know, didn't
you, that it was your duty
to stay with your battalion?
Yes sir.
- And you must have been
very well aware of that all
the time you were absent
from the first moment
you decided to
decided to have.
I I don't know sir.
But you could walk, talk
think like anybody else.
And you managed to get
quite a long way, didn't you?
Like I just said, sir,
I was lucky.
Well let me put this
to you quite simply,
did you know
what you were doing?
I I knew what I was doing, sir
And you realized that you
were leaving your comrades
at their posts who were
prepared to do their duty
while you deserted them.
Didn't you? Didn't you?
I've never done this before sir.
This was the first time.
No more questions sir.
That'll do, Private Hamp
Captain Hargreaves will you
address the court now
on the prisoner's behalf?
No sir.
I will address the court
on its behalf.
The prisoner, when he did the
thing for which he's being tried
was no longer responsible
for his actions.
This court is responsible
for its actions.
It has not lost
possession of itself.
This Court knows clearly
what it's doing.
This Court has the
power to choose.
Private Hamp is not a liar.
He's not glib, he has
no ready answers.
He has an embarrassing honesty
which made him a bad
witness in his own case.
He could have put a
bullet through his leg and
suffered nothing more serious
than a term of imprisonment.
He even told me he
thought of doing so.
But he didn't.
He stayed.
A deserter in full consciousness
of what he is doing,
runs away to save his own skin
and leaves his fellows to do the
fighting and the dying for him.
This man is not a deserter.
He volunteered.
He volunteered because
his wife and her mother
dared him to.
Never mind - he volunteered.
He's been out here
for three years.
Longer, if I may say so,
than some of us have been.
He's seen it all.
A man can only take so much.
So much blood.
So much filth.
So much dying.
In the shell hole
he thought he was
drowning in the mud
He thought his time had
come and it had.
After that he was no longer
responsible for his actions.
He hadn't got the power to
decide whether to stay or to go.
He had one instinct only left
the instinct to walk.
To walk home To walk
away from the guns.
They've become a
fact of our daily lives.
So much so that we
no longer ask each other
why they're being fired.
Is this war so old
and are we so old in it
that we've forgotten?
Are we not fighting
to preserve some
notion of decency?
Some notion of justice?
To preserve for this Court
the right to choose?
I beg to remind the Court, if
justice is not done to one man,
then other men are
dying for nothing.
Matter of opinion.
Prescott.
You as our legal member
advise the court on the law
as it applies to this case.
The Court will remember
that the soldier
takes the law of England
with him wherever he goes,
and he's protected by it.
The accused does not have
to prove himself innocent;
the prosecution
must prove him guilty.
If the members of the Court
have any reasonable doubt
but it must not be
a fanciful doubt,
they must give him
the benefit of it.
You have before you the opinion
of the Battalion Medical Officer
which is that at the
time the prisoner
left the Battalion
he was fit for duty
and was not shell shocked
but only suffering
from what the doctor
described as 'cold feet. '
You must not be unduly swayed
by the eloquence of
the Defending Officer,
who has quite properly made
out the best case he can.
If doubt that the prisoner
really meant to desert,
and you believe that he merely
went absent without leave
and intended to return
after a few days,
you will give a
verdict accordingly.
On the other hand,
if you are satisfied that the
prisoner really deserted,
it is your duty
to find him guilty.
As to the stress the
Defending Officer
laid upon the prisoner
being a volunteer,
neither must you be
unduly swayed by that.
The Army is now composed of
regulars, of volunteers
and of conscripts,
and one law applies to them all.
And it is the Court's duty to
administer the law as it stands.
We will proceed immediately to
our discussion of the case.
Private Hamp, 'shun.
- Thank you Captain Midgley,
Captain Hargreaves.
Escort fall in on the
right of the prisoner.
Prisoner and escort left turn.
Quick march. Left right,
left, right left
Thanks for cutting
my throat, old boy.
Well you were overdoing
it a bit, I couldn't help n.
I thought there was a great deal
in what you said
if I may say so.
Thank you.
- You did very well, Hargreaves,
I hope you got him off.
- I hope so too.
But you know, a proper
Court is concerned with law.
Ifs a bit amateur
to plead for justice.
What do you want now, then?
Have you seen my rifle, Corp?
Well why would you
be wanting that?
Well I just thought I
might give it a clean.
You know, something to do.
The way they did the Court
Martial it could be anybody
You know, I kept forgetting
they was talking about me.
Er er Mr. Hargreaves,
he gave them a lovely speech.
"This man is not a deserter. "
Oh...
You've been twice since
you got back already.
It's not my fault, is it?
Right. Guard.
Corporal.
- Latrine'
Right wheel
Help yourself, Mr. Morris.
Stand easy, Mr. Prescott.
Hm. Mr' Morris wishes to know
whether we can find the prisoner
guilty and recommend mercy.
Yes sir, you may.
And you may either confirm
the sentence yourself
or send it to a higher
authority for confirmation.
I see.
Mr Prescott. Never mind.
- Thank you.
Er would you help Captain
Cartwright prepare a finding?
Er guilty of desertion but
emphasize good conduct, length
of service' that kind of thing
but don't put in anything
about mental health.
They're not interested in that
sort of thing at Headquarters.
When you've finished,
have it read to the prisoner
and then send it
off for confirmation.
Right, gentlemen.
Won't know anything
for a bit yet.
It's got to go to the
Generals and that lot.
It'll be a week then.
They're all pinned down
in Paris, you know.
What's Hamp thinking, I wonder.
If he's got any sense,
he's not thinking
Whatever happens he's
not going up the line again.
Do you know what he
said when he got back?
"They're taking a lot
of trouble over me. "
Feels bloody honored, he does.
Yes, they're taking twenty
four hours to kill him.
Jerry wouldn't take that long.
He'll get the glasshouse.
Captain Hargreaves, sir.
- Yes.
I don't know if
it's allowed, sir,
but he says he'd
like to see you.
Who?
- Private Hamp, sir.
Would that be legal,
Mr. Prescott?
Well, I I'm afraid it would
be highly irregular, sir.
It would be kind.
All right, I'm coming.
Yes.
- Messages for the Colonel, sir.
I see. Come with me.
Excuse me, sir. Message, sir.
- Ah, thank you Mr. Webb.
Er go and get yourself
something to eat, Corporal.
Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen, your
attention, please.
The Battalion will be
moving into the line
tomorrow morning at 06:00 hours.
We will be reinforcing
a battalion
of the Munster Fusiliers.
Captain Cartwright, would you
ask all Company Commanders
to come to my billet after
dinner at er... 20:00 hours?
Right, sir.
- Thank you, gentlemen.
Well, Hamp?
Sir.
Er.. it's just that I'd
like to thank you, sir.
Er, in case er
well you know I expect I'll
get put in military prison,
you know, and er in case
I don't see you for a while.
We, er we don't know
where you'll be put,
if you're put anywhere.
Well anyway, sir, I I wouldn't
like to miss thanking you
You've taught me
a lot of things, sir,
and I'm very grateful.
Have I?
Rather too late, I fear.
AH right, thank you.
You, er...
you haven't heard anything,
have you, sir?
No.
I mean, after what you said
they couldn't help but
well it was the truth.
That's what I'm trying to say.
Nearly everything you said
I could never have said it.
No, I mean it sir.
Oh, I don't know
about that, sir.
It was my duty.
If you'd remembered your duty
none of this idiotic rigmarole
would have been necessary.
Cant you get that
into your head.
Don't thank me
for doing my duty.
I had to
just as you should
have done yours'
Yes, sir.
It's not as if I haven't thought
about it, sir I have.
I know what they could do to me.
It's just that er
I wouldn't be thinking
I stood a chance
if it hadn't been for you.
Prisoner shun.
With your permission, sir.
Yes.
Private Hamp, A.J.,
Number 873426,
it is my duty to inform you that
the General Officer
Commanding in Chief
has confirmed the sentence
passed on you by the
Field General Court Martial.
You will suffer
death by shooting
on Thursday, October 22nd,
at 05:30 hours.
When's that sir?
Tomorrow.
More wine, Midgley?
Er no thank you sir.
Would you excuse me now, sir?
Yes of course.
- Thank you, sir.
Some Haig over there.
Pure chlorine.
Oh, beg your pardon sir.
Rather shod on ceremony,
aren't we?
Yes, sir.
I had too much of that today.
You know the verdict?
Just now.
You lost.
We all lost.
We're bloody murderers.
Don't be idiotic, Charles.
Pull yourself together.
Pull yourself together
pull yourself together.
That's what they
said to him today.
Pull yourself together, you're
talking like a bloody doctor.
Aren't we rather
overstepping, old boy?
All right.
I'm sorry.
But er why?
Hm?
Actually why?
Why?
- Mm.
Was it O'Sullivan's evidence?
You know he's an idiot.
Was was it my defense?
I... I did my best.
Very eloquent, Charles.
But nothing to
do with the facts.
Facts, facts, facts.
You 're going to shoot
that poor little bastard
simply because he
went for a walk.
That's all it was, you know.
It was a technical
desertion but just a
a bloody little walk, really.
And you know it.
Don't you?
These facts
“your battalion
moving up tomorrow
important to maintain morale.
Sentence of death to be
carried out immediately. "
Pour encourager les autres, eh?
Has it ever encouraged anyone?
Discouraged anyone?
Of course it has.
Are you sure'?
No not quite.
Who's in charge tomorrow?
Jack Webb.
His man, his platoon,
his mistake. Teach him a lesson.
By the way, I've written
the next of kin letter,
I wonder would you mind giving
it to Webb as you go out?
“There's a porpoise
close behind me
And it's treading on my tail“
Huh?
Facts.
"When I am buried and
all my thoughts and acts
Will be reduced to lists
and dales and facts,
And long before this
wondering ﬂesh is rotten
The dates that made
me will be all forgotten. "
Hamp!
Hamp!
Is that you, Corp?
- Aye.
Now listen up.
Wilson and your lot, they've
been nicking some rum.
Oh.
- Aye.
We've got some of the
good stuff and all, mate.
Thinking about a booze
up tonight, you know.
Well I thought you
were bringing it.
No.
- Well where's rest of them?
Coming.
- You'll get into trouble
No to heH with that, man.
Shut the door.
What's this for, then?
Somebody's birthday?
Is he very religious?
I don't think so. Official
C. of E but
You'll be staying with him
right through the night?
Of course, if he's willing.
Yes, well, I've laid on
something which might
prove just as useful
How does the idea strike you?
It's not for me to say.
Well I've spoken to the 0.0.
It's left to his discretion
and he's left it to me.
So he said
he said, that man in
bed with my wife
was me.
Was me.
There is no disgrace
no disgrace at all.
Here today gone tomorrow.
It doesn't mailer
who kills you, does n?
Well you know, you
you've lived a long life,
Hamp, and you're due.
You'll rot tn the mud,
and that's that.
It doesn't matter what anyone
bloody well thinks about it,
does it?
Hey, we're all moving up soon.
We'll be in the same
boat as you are.
We'll all be rat food,
before long.
Last drink in bottle.
Who's going to get it?
You'd think I
was entitled to it.
Fire!
Come on. Come on.
- Right' Come on.
Come on.
Give it here.
- Come on'
All right, open up.
Where are you, you bastards?
Will you let me try to help you?
Do you want to talk to me?
God decides when it is
our turn to be taken to him.
Will you be absolved
of your sins?
My son, despise not thou
the chastening of the Lord,
nor faint when thou
art rebuked of him.
For whom the Lord loveth,
he chasteneth,
and scourgeth every
son whom he receiveth.
Our Lord Jesus Christ,
who has left power to his
church to absolve all sinners
who truly repent and believe
in him of His great mercy
forgives thee thine of fences
and by His authority
committed to me;
I absolve thee from all thy sins
in the name of the Father,
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost.
We do not presume to come to
this thy table, 0 merciful Lord,
trusting in our own
righteousness,
but in Thy manifold
and great mercies.
We are not worthy so much
as to gather the crumbs
from under Thy table
But Thou art the same Lord
whose property is
always to have mercy.
Grant us therefore,
gracious Lord,
so to eat the ﬂesh of thy
dear Son Jesus Christ
and to drink his blood
that our sinful bodies may
be made clean by His body
and our souls washed through
His most precious Blood
and that we may evermore
dwell in him end He in us.
Amen.
The body of our
Lord Jesus Christ
which was given for thee
The blood of our
Lord Jesus Christ
which was shed for thee
preserve thy soul
unto everlasting life.
Well where's the soul, Padre?
Here.
AH that's left here is a few
hours of moody nothing.
Aaaaah!
This ground
Oh will grow
Oh will grow
no more buttercups.
Oh
Quick march.
Left right, left right,
left right, left
Left wheel
Squad hah.
Left turn.
Break it up. Break it up.
Escort dismiss!
Left right, left right,
left right, left
Fill the gap!
Squad squad 'shun.
Stand in line.
Front rank kneel.
Aim
Fire!
No.
Isn't it finished yet?
No, sir.
I'm sorry.
Hamp, 10 Gifford Street,
Islmgton, London:
Deeply regret to inform
you Private A. J. Hamp
killed in action October 22nd
the Army Council
express their sympathy.
Secretary War Office.
