-It won't be any good!
-It's perect!
-It won't be any good!
-I never pick a bad watermeIon!
-Want a bet?
-Sure. For what?
You're on!
Giddy up.
-I have to piss!
-My tummy hurs!
I'm thirsy!
You're the one who's no

HoId on. Get of now...
Oh, my poor IitIe brother

Open wide!
Come on! Open up!
Mustafa, you can't
Just Iie there moaning.
WeIcome Keri, my son, are you weII?
Doctor Kirkor despite aII the warnings
our organization has given you...
...you are stiII treating Turkish patients!
See here, I won't warn you again.
My boy, what diference does it
make if a patient is Turkish, EngIish...
-A sick man is a sick man.
-Don't taIk so much!
Look here! This is the
Iast time I warn you!
Munire, I'm thirsy!
-Wait for me pIease.
-Yes sir Mr. Kirkor.
HeIIo there Mehmet my boy
Is your father home?
He is at schooI UncIe Kirkor. But
Mustafa is upstairs and...
...you are the onIy one who can
save us from his whining...
Don't wory, I'II take care of him.
-HeIIo Munire my girI, are you weII?
-I am fine, thank you UncIe Kirkor.
Why do you caII him?
Are there no doctors Ief that
you have to caII an Armenian?
It's not the first
time he has come here...
He has been Iooking afer us
since we were babies.
I swear, if it were up to these
guys they wouId strangIe us aII.
They use evey opporuniy
they can to get rid of us.
...and you Iet an Armenian
into your house...
You're Just Iike your dad SeIim.
It's Iike I'm Iistening to
UncIe AIi Riza taIk.
What's this got to do with my father?
You haven't eaten your
dinner Mustafa bey my son.
So now I have to give you an
inJection to make you stronger.
Munire pIease...
UncIe Kirkor, if it's aIright,
couId Mustafa eat his meaI.
...and if he doesn't get stronger,
then you couId give him the inJection?
WiII he eat it though? What if he
doesn't Iisten to you again?
-I swear I wiII... ReaIIy!
-He'II do as I ask, won't you Mustafa?
I wiII.
Its bronchitis, Iike before.
Let him rest for a few days.
Be carefuI about what
he eats and the medication.
Otherise this couId
become pneumonia. Goodbye!
Goodbye UncIe Kirkor, thank you.
Let's go.
Sory to bother you Aunt
AIiye, thank you for coming.
Don't mention it my dear.
I hope he is beter soon.
-Mehmet! Don't make too much noise!
-AIright Munire!
Have you seen anyhing
but good from that man?
We are the chiIdren of the war.
We are a generation that grew up, even as
babies, on the sorrows of war stories...
We did not experience any wars
at first hand in Van...
But there was not a singIe househoId that
had not sufered the sorrow of warare.
We Iearned from Grandfather
Rasih in the 93 war...
...from our brother Captain Mithat,
who died in the BaIkan War...
My mother passed away, unabIe
to bear the pain of that war.
We have aII seen the coId face of war,
but we have never feIt it ''vey cIose''.
UntiI that day...
There dead both of them.
That day I feIt what enmiy was
with my entire hear.
NotJust enmiy...
Hate that came up to our doors and the
war that quickIy caught up our chiIdren...
Friends... We have a visitor
from our IstanbuI branch.
He has brought us the greetings of
Mr. GabrieI, and some instructions...
PIease Brother Amazaso.
-HeIIo brothers!
-HeIIo... WeIcome.
When the Russian army atacks Turkey
we wiII star uprisings everhere...
...and oficiaI buiIdings
wiII be bombed...
Our brothers in the Turkish army wiII
deser from their detachments...
...to Join the Russian army...
-You have spoken to the doctor today?
-I spoke with him.
-It was a vey usefuI interview.
-Our brothers in Van...
...wiII continue to arm
and suppor our organization...
...when the army Ieaves the ciy
successive rebeIIions wiII begin.
May he rest in peace.
My deepest sympathy.
Let's go!
SeIect paricuIarIy those boys
who are of high schooI age.
You wiII train them to shoot...
But don't say they are ''Iearning to
shoot'' or that this is miIitay training...
Give it a more famiIy-Iike
atmosphere, Iike it is a spor.
In this way the young men wiII become
more famiIiar with the rifIe.
And the Tashnak gueriIIas wiII understand
that we aren'tJust kicking our heeIs.
They are geting more and more out
of hand with each passing day.
Find the headmaster of
the high schooI Mr. JemaI.
If he is free, teII him I wouId Iike
to drink cofee with him this evening.
Yes sir!
Inform JemaI Bey of the
Pasha's invitation immediateIy.
Ready! Fire!
Today, I was invited by the
army commander KamiI Pasha.
We had cofee together.
He has found a wonderuI summer task
for you. Training with rifIes.
First you wiII be trained, and
then there wiII be a competition...
When do we star, papa?
I thought you were too iII
even to go to the corner shop?
Ah, papa!
Your turn wiII come.
First the bigger boys.
Fire!
He missed again.
Lieutenant SuIeyman?
My brother missed again!
I and Lieutenant SuIeyman knew each
other since we were chiIdren.
Even when we were Just stared
primay schooI he wouId say...
''I'm going to be a Iieutenant!'' then he
wouId say ''And I'm going to mary you!''
When the war finished he became a
Iieutenant and then we got engaged.
When we were preparing for our
wedding, the TrabIus War began...
...and we said Iet the war finish
and then we wiII get married...
...and SuIeyman went of to war.
You missed? Why did you miss?
Because you are stiII scared!
Don't wory, the rifIe won't go
of right away! Give it here!
Now watch!
You can feeI when the trigger
engages with your finger.
Press untiI the trigger becomes firm.
See, it doesn't go of...
When you feeI it become hard...
Then the rifIe is ready to shoot.
Go ahead, ty!
The TrabIus War finished, and the BaIkan
War stared, SuIeyman went there too.
...it Iasted for to years...
Good Job Mehmet! Do you
think we earned some tea?
Right away Iieutenant!
Years Iater that summer he came.
...and afer aII those years we
imagined Iiving a summer without war.
...even though eveyone was saying that
a great war wouId break out in Europe.''
Sometimes, I think you
Iove him more than me.
-Who, Mehmet?
-No.Your rifIe!
-Thank you!
-EnJoy it.
We were happy. We were pIanning
to get married in the autumn.
Ready!
Fire!
Ready!
Fire!
The resuIt of the firing competition
First pIace...
One of the reasons for Iast year's
defeat in the BaIkan War was...
...as Mahmud Muhtar Pasha said...
''Pride and conceit!''
He wouId say ''AIIah doesn't Iike pride and
conceit, and this is why we were defeated!''
As a nation we don't Iove
each other enough!
This is the actuaI probIem.
At Ieast we don't Iove each other as
much as the peopIe of Western countries.
My request to you as an
oIder brother, as an eIder...
AIways Iove one another, protect
one another, watch out for one another, ...
AIways remain friends. If you argue, don't
stop speaking to one another, never!
AIways keep your hears together.
Both for your own future
and for that of your county.
What is the Iatest
news in Europe Governor?
I am sure you have the
Iatest news from IstanbuI.
They say that it isn't vey
good. Things are heating up.
God protect us, but
if war breaks out...
Then the division might Ieave the town...
Sir, war won't break out inshaIIah
and the division wiII aIways be with us.
-Your ExceIIency...
-Of course, we mustn't faiI to be prepared.
WeII done.
-WeII, good evening my boy.
-Good evening my pasha!
-HeIIo, good evening friends.
-Good evening Pasha.
My pasha!
Your ExceIIency, we are vey
gratefuI for the rifIe training...
...that you have provided for our sons...
However... This...
What does this signif?
Our boys wiII one day, inshaIIah, finish
schooI and then they wiII go to the army...
My hope is that they are
ready a IitIe earIier...
It has nothing to do with the
war or the Tashnak gueriIIas.
The training is not because of them!
-Good evening Headmaster
-Good evening Sermet bey.
May AIIah give you repose.
-Good night Mehmet.
-Good night Ferit.
Didn't I say to you that if you couIdn't
do something, you shouIdn't ty?
Get inside. You have totaIIy
embarrassed me again! Get inside!
Mehmet? Mehmet?
The Ar of War.
...to our beIoved brother Mehmet. First
prize in the shooting contest in 1914.
With my Iove... KamiI Pasha Commander
GeneraI of the 19th Brigade.
-Who are they Sergeant Musa?
-ProbabIy Armenians. They are emigrating.
They are saying that there
wiII be war again sir!
The Russians aren't content with
Kars and Ardahan...
Now they have their eye
on Van and Erzurum...
Oh, these are the good Armenians...
They aren't interested in rebeIIing and aII that.
They Just want to get away
and save themseIves.
The gueriIIas wiII Join the Russians
to ty to take eveyhing here...
May AIIah not Ieave us in need.
Even when the enemy is asIeep
one must be aware...
And the enemy isn't sIeeping sir.
Giddy up you nag.
If you don't get me to Van by
afernoon, then there'II be troubIe!
Hear ye... Hear ye!
A generaI mobiIization
has been decIared!
AII soIdiers are to take up arms!
GeneraI mobiIization has been decIared!
AII soIdiers are to take up arms!
We are out of sugar.
Yes, yes we've heard. I wouId be surprised
if there is no mobiIization! Giddy up!
Papa!
-MobiIization has been decIared, Papa!
-That's what they're saying!
-You're not frightened, are you?
-No.
We Just came to town,
we were wandering around.
Fine, then take these provisions home,
and I wiII go see AIi Riza.
Thank you vey much Sergeant
Musa, God be with you.
Thank you sir!
Give a IitIe to the sergeant...
He has rights to it afer aII.
Ok papa.
Here, Mehmet. I'm tired, you
take the reins for a whiIe!
Giddi up you oId nag!
Hear ye... Hear ye.
GeneraI mobiIization has been decIared,
soIdiers are to take up arms!
SoIdiers are to take up arms!
You haven't been around for three days,
so you probabIy haven't heard.
Eveybody in Europe is at each others'
throats; Germans, Russians, EngIish, French.
The big war that eveybody has been taIking
about seems to have finaIIy stared.
That's why there is a generaI mobiIization,
we have to be prepared for war too.
They are caIIing aII the
young men to arms again.
So who are we going to fight this time?
They say apparentIy it is not cIear yet.
Whoever atacks us...
At Ieast it is cIear who wiII atack
us; the Russians for sure!
The Russians for sure, my nephew
has Just come from Erzurum...
He says the Tashnak bastards
are openIy saying that...
...they wiII demoIish Van.
We saw a convoy of Armenians
emigrating, cameIs...
...ox cars, chiIdren...
They have destroyed the county and
now naturaIIy they are running away...
ShaII I teII you something Headmaster JemaI?
You shouId have no mercy
for the enemies of the Turks!
Wherever you find them...
Be right back, papa.
They kiIIed him.
Dear or dear... Are there no Iimits?
Where are you going brothers! You
beIong here, we beIong here.
-Why wouId you abandon your own Iand?
-Don't ty to stop us.
We don't want war or Iand.
We are mereIy tying to find
somewhere for our chiIdren to Iive!
If you are thinking of
your chiIdren, turn back!
Up ahead are Turkish gangs,
they wiII chop you into pieces.
Turn back and wait for the bIessed day.
Our Russian brothers wiII be here soon
and this wiII once again be Armenia!
Come on.
You are making a big mistake, beIieve me.
Those who Iisten to us wiII be saved.
If you want to Iive,
Iisten to us! Don't go!
So, Headmaster, you think that the
situation in the viIIages isn't vey good?
We guessed that the Tashnak activities
had increased to such a degree...
That is why I wasn't surprised.
Look, we have reached such a state that
there is a murder nearIy evey day.
So, it seems that we are the next to Ieave.
You are one of the
peopIe I trust in this ciy.
Thank you, you are vey kind Pasha.
There is no need to
hide things from you.
Information from Erzurum,
from the Third Army.
They say that the Russians
couId atack at any moment.
...and we are ordered to transfer
to the border as soon as possibIe...
Why wory about not smoking at a time
Iike this. Light one Headmaster!
This order is to be kept secret...
We don't want the Tashnak gueriIIas
to Iearn about our deparure...
...untiI the Iast possibIe minute...
But I am going to teach
them such a Iesson.
That it wiII take them a
few months to recover.
Headmaster!
I entrust the young men first
to AIIah and then to you.
How much Ionger do we have
to wait before going into action?
GeneraI mobiIization has been decIared.
They say we shouId wait for the Andronik
Division to Ieave. We have to wait!
-What if they don't go?
-Don't wory. It won't be Iong!
Van wiII be ours, aII ours!
It wiII be ours.
Stop taIking so much and get
busy, come on, get on with it.
It wiII be ours, aII ours!
One day we wiII be freed from
this torment, one day.
We wiII strike to the East and to the
West with Iightning, haiI one day.
We wiII shine in the bIack
cIouds and strike with Iightning...
We wiII send thunder, haiI one day.
From Kars, Batum, the Caucasus...
...we wiII destroy the fors with
the nationaI cannons, one day.
We are born as Turks, we wiII Iive as
Turks, and we wiII aIways be Turks...
One day we wiII be free from this
viIe Russian grip, one day!
Bravo! WeII done! Hurray! Bravo!
I swear, he is notJust the great
SeIim, but Yavuz SuItan SeIim.
AIIah! It is time for evening prayer.
We've Iost track of time!
What is happening?
Ferit, where are you
going? It's Iate.
Come here!
What are you stupid or something?
Don't you ever use this?
MobiIization had been decIared,
eveybody is on aIer...
...the streets are fuII of
viIIains and thieves...
Our IitIe friend isn't worried
at aII, enJoying himseIf aII night!
Where are you going?
Come here!
Sit down there and Iisten to me!
The situation isn't good.
War is about to break out.
We have to Ieave Van immediateIy!
Your uncIe has writen to us. He is Iooking
for a safe pIace for the famiIy in IstanbuI.
He asks us to come too.
He says ''Send Ferit ahead''.
Go, get out of here!
My dear, are you hungy?
There are some beans.
No, thank you mother,
I ate with Mehmet!
Look what you've done to this boy. He
can't think of anyhing but his stomach!
Is a war going to star?
If war breaks out... Does
Lieutenant SuIeyman have to go?
Of course he wiII go.
He is the one they reaIIy need
and he wiII be one of the first to go.
-What about you?
-I'm not oId enough yet.
But if they send me of course I wiII go.
Did I do aII that training for nothing?
-But I haven't had any training yet!
-Don't be in such a rush...
You are stiII too young.
By the time it is your turn
the war wiII be Iong over.
Don't think about such things,
it's time to go to sIeep.
May AIIah give you comfor!
Mehmet...
WiII Chubby Ferit go as weII?
Sir, afer the arrivaI of the
Our transition wiII be compIeted.
Are there any questions?
Keep your eyes peeIed...
They have managed to
take away much from us.
If they atack again they wiII be
atacking to take eveyhing!
My father for days has been
taIking about nothing but...
IstanbuI this, IstanbuI that.
It's aII he can think about...
Sometimes... I wish that I was
dead and free of aII this!
If you are going to die
then die in the war!
Why are you wasting
your Iife for nothing here?
We won't be here much
Ionger at any rate!
My father keeps saying ''The
situation is vey serious'' and...
He can't taIk about anyhing eIse.
He says we have to move
as soon as possibIe.
Are you moving or running away?
Why don't you ask your dad
when you get home?
Give him my greetings.
Cowards!
Why don't you Ieave him aIone? What
has he done? The way his father...
If the father is not a man what
can you expect from the son?
He shouId say ''I'm not going, I'm
not running away''...
He shouId say, there's been a caII up,
why don't you Join up...
Ferit! Wait, I'm coming too. Ferit.
Sometimes you know
sometimes you reaIIy are no good!
-Mehmet, we're going home!
-Don't get wet! Go under the Ieaves.
Come on, we shouId go too. Come
on. Come on, Iet's go come on.
Mustafa! Just Iook at you!
You've onIy Just goten beter!
UncIe Sabri's son died in training.
-They aII went to give their condoIences.
-Why didn't you go?
I couIdn't. I need some more time.
What does this mean?
What do you think? For Mehmet
to give him hear, a present.
-I'II be back!
-When wiII you come?
I'II be here at the first chance I get.
So many days...
So many days... I guess
you didn't have a chance.
...and now you give me this gun...
When are you going?
We're not going anyhere SuItan
Munire. We wiII be here.
Sure...
...and that is what you said when
you went to the TrabIus War.
I didn't see you for three years then.
That was diferent.
BeIieve me my dear,
nothing wiII happen!
What about the mobiIization? And you are
transferring to the border and the war?
Even if you don't go
now, you wiII go in the end!
Take this...
A present from me.
Even my father didn't give
the sIightest indication...
It was onIy days Iater that
I reaIized you had gone...
And without you the ciy was empy,
it had become another ciy.
I am afraid but I am happy!
Because I am gratefuI that
there is no war yet.
And that, inshaIIah,
there never wiII be...
Do you know what saddens me most?
Forget spending hoIidays together...
...but years have gone by and we have not
been abIe to share a Ramadan meaI.
That is fate. Next year, inshaIIah!
May AIIah keep you safe my SuIeyman,
Your Munire.
-May you have a bIessed hoIiday, sir.
-Happy hoIidays to you Commander!
-Headmaster, bIessed hoIiday!
-And to you too.
-Happy hoIidays!
-Happy hoIidays!
Sir, there is a teIegram for you.
The Russians have gone on
the atack towards Erzurum.
The war has stared gentIemen.
We don't have enough
ammunition at the front.
Thank God there is fog everhere
and the Russians cannot move.
Otherise they wouId have
destroyed us by now.
We don't have enough
ammunition even for a week!
Lieutenant CoIoneI AIi Ihsan said we had
requested ammunition from Erzurum?
Is there no news?
Erzurum is waiting for more from IstanbuI.
IstanbuI is waiting for more from Germany.
The Germans say it'II arrive tomorrow.
I don't get itas things are
being dragged out so Iong...
...then why are we asking for
heIp aII the way from Erzurum...
...instead of bringing the
ammunitions that are in Van?
Just Iast month we asked for
reinforcements from Van.
They sent eveyone incIuding the
prisoners in the JaiI...
Other than 3-5 guards in the ciy, there
is not a man Ief who can hoId a gun.
Now you suggest that we take
what ammunitions they have Ief?
I pray that KamiI Pasha
doesn't hear you...
...or he wiII make you go
get the munitions in Van.
...and cary them here on your back.
Today we spoke with
the governor of Erzurum.
Our division isn't Ieting the
Russians through, thank God.
However... As a resuIt of 3 months of war
there aren't many carridges Ief...
And if repIacement munitions
don't arrive quickIy from Erzurum...
...they say that the situation
wiII be vey serious...
Ibrahim Bey, the commander of the
Home Guard, and myseIf thought...
...we have decided to send the remaining
munitions in the ciy to the division...
We are going to send it but
there are no horses or cars Ief.
We wiII send it, we want
to send it but how?
-Headmaster, your tea!
-Thank you Ragip Efendi.
So, Headmaster? What kind
of measure do you suggest?
We shouId cary the
munitions ourseIves!
That is aII fine and weII Headmaster.
How many peopIe are we here...
Let's say we put the munitions
on our backs and set out...
...the front is at Ieast a
five to six day waIk...
What happens if we aren't strong enough and
the munitions Iay wasted in the mountains?
Moreover, if we go, the schooI,
hospitaI, the province...
The ciy wiII aII be
compIeteIy abandoned.
The most imporant thing is
the securiy of our ciy.
Our division broke the back
of the wretched Tashnaks.
However, they are watching us...
If we go, who wiII protect our homes
if, God forbid, there is an atack?
-Sir I have a suggestion, but...
-Go ahead.
I hate to say it but...
if there is no other way
I have a 16 year oId son...
My onIy forune in this worId, my
onIy possession, the Iight of my eye...
I give you my son.
Let us gather aII the boys of his age who
are at the schooI and in the ciy.
Doctor, what kind of suggestion is that?
I'II pretend I didn't hear it!
Headmaster, I Ieave our
young ones to AIIah and you.
Protect them from danger
and accidents...
...the best that you can...
Are we the onIy ones who wiII protect
our homes against the Russians?
Are we to say to our chiIdren
''You are too IitIe, stay where you are?''
At the moment, thank God, the
Russians are not yet at our door...
...the Tashnak gueriIIas
have been broken...
No mater how dificuIt it is,
I can see no other soIution...
Go home and ask your
wife about your idea!
Let's see if she is as generous as you.
What kind of a mother wouId agree to send
her chiId on such a dangerous duy, doctor?
What kind of a mother...
What kind of a mother...
We'II take the munitions ourseIves,
the chiIdren are too young...
Doctor if you had suggested that you and I,
onIy us, were to cary the munitions...
...beIieve me, that wouId have
been much more reasonabIe!
But our chiIdren?
Let them take the chiIdren they say!
As if I found my son in the street...
I'm gonna Ioad him with goods and
send him of into the mountains!
Send your own chiIdren!
WeII, I don't understand either, but
Iet's wait and see what happens.
-Good evening.
-Good evening!
As if my son couId save the county!
Open up!
Did you die!
Eveybody in the ciy has
gone mad. Eveybody!
We're Ieaving, star packing.
Don't waste time with trinkets. Just
take what we wiII need on the road.
We'II set up home in IstanbuI again. We'II
set out tomorrow before the sun is up.
Get on with it!
Why are you Just siting there?
Get up now or I'II kiII you!
I'm not coming Papa.
What do you mean ''I'm not coming''?
Stay out of it woman!
-How can you taIk to your father...
-I'm not coming!
UngratefuI wretch! You
are no Ionger my son!
Stay here then! Stay and...
Ingrate!
If war breaks out does Lieutenant
SuIeyman have to go?
Of course he wiII go. He is
the one they reaIIy need.
-...he wiII be one of the first to go.
-And you?
If the division wasn't in the
ciy there is no doubt that...
...those murderers, the Tashnak gueriIIas'd
have kiIIed Dr. Kirkor in our own house.
...and us as weII...
Stay away from that!
Haven't aII these seperations
been enough?
How many more peopIe
wiII I have to cy for?
If it were me, I wouId go, Mehmet!
That night, we experienced the
darkest moments of our Iives
One side were thousands of soIdiers waiting
hopeIessIy for ammunition at the front.
Lieutenant SuIeyman... Evey
house had a Lieutenant SuIeyman.
...Ief without ammunition in the
middIe of the war.
In evey house a son, a father.
On the other side those who had
not yet had their fiII of chiIdhood...
...the young sapIings that had
not yet experienced spring.
I couId do nothing...
...haIf of my hear was pIeading,
screaming ''Don't go boys, don't do this...''
WhiIe the other haIf was shouting
''Don't hesitate! Run! Go right now!
My duy is to protect you, not to throw
you out on a dangerous Journey
Is it not our duy sir
to make sure that...
...the enemy does not trampIe
the graves of our brothers?
Yes, yes, this is our duy, yes...
That's my father!
WeII, if it is your father, so what
nephew? What are you frightened of?
What's aII this! This
isn't a barn you know!
-Is he here?
-He's here.
Come and get him
if you think you can.
Ok, ok, Ferit go home.

That day with a unified desire
on the par of our students...
Journey. 120 chiIdren beteen 12 and 1 7.
First we turned to dressing
them for the weather...
...because this was to be a Iong Journey...
Long and arduous. For days and nights,
they wouId be crossing snoy mountains...
Those famiIies that couId gave sheets,
curains, bIankets, whatever they had...
given rifIes and were quickIy trained.
PIans were made for our chiIdren on this
Iong Journey. AII detaiIs were considered.
The governor appointed some
soIdiers to provide extra securiy.
''Our chiIdren need these more than we do''
they said and gave them to the convoy.
May AIIah make it compIete!
...as if missing you is not enough,
now the wory of our chiIdren...
...has setIed in our hears.
Our prayers are with you.
AIIah keep my SuIeyman safe...
Keep aII of you safe. Your Munire.
Sister!
CouId you give this to Reyhan?
With AIIah's wiII we wiII deIiver the
munitions and in the same way...

The most gIorious army,

Come on Iads. Come on.
-I think the time is right.
-Not yet be patient!
Let them get a bit more tired, and
then we'II pick them of, one by one!
Let's get to the horses!
The Tashnak gueriIIas were seen
near the Abadan viIIage, sir.
AIong the route the
chiIdren are waIking...
-There were many of them.
-When were they seen?
Two days ago!
What a state we are in!
They caII us a division, but we
don't have enough forces for anyhing...
Our ammunition is spent, desperateIy
we wait for a handfuI of buIIets carried...
...on the back of our chiIdren,
that wiII onIy heIp for a few days.
This is what happens if you go to war
on the promises of the Germans...
Our own negIect, our own Iack of wiII,
and own incompetence means that...
...our own innocent
chiIdren have to undergo...
...these dificuIties in
the spring of their Iives...
Put together a detachment of
the strong ones, but hury...
Yes sir!
Yes sir?
Be carefuI!

-Is anyone wounded?
-We are fine, sir.
-Sergean Musa!
-My SuIeyman!
My sister's fiancé is

We have been saved thank God!
Atention!
Now, Iads. Head for the front.
Those are our men!
Our men!
SuIeyman...
They were in Abadan on the 23rd,
and they passed Tadan on the 24th...
They are coming my dear,
they are coming...
To make the route shorer,
they have Ief the main road...
...and are taking a shorcut
through the mountains.
Thank god!
They wiII come much faster
now they are carying Iess...
The governor says they did remarkabIy weII,
to cover eighy kiIometers in to days.
Our IitIe brothers were Iucky those
days as the weather was so good...
No one was worried in Van anymore.
I'II never forget that evening...
...the evening of 24 Januay.
We experienced the first night
of peace of mind in ten days...
Come on Iads. Forard march!
Mehmet, the weather is turning. Don't
Iet anyone separate from the Iine.
Eveyone stay cIose.
-Pass it down the Iine.
-Yes sir Sergeant.
Friends! Eveyone stay cIose...

Don't stop! Eveyone stay cIose.
Come on Iads.

Go! Go! Go!
Papa! Papa! Papa!
-Papa. Look outside!
-What's the mater dear?
Papa. Look outside!
SIow down, dear.
Don't be so quick to wory.
Papa, where are you going?
To the governor's ofice;
perhaps they have some news.
It's not Iong to morning now.
I can't Iet you go on your own
in this weather! I'm coming too.
-Is the governor in?
-He's upstairs.
PIease come in Miss, I'II take that.
-Teacher JemaI is here, he wants to see you.
-Show him in.
-Headmaster, weIcome. PIease come...
-Thank you.
...and sit down. My dear,
come sit here pIease.
Do you have any information
about the chiIdren?
I have been tying aII night but...
...the teIegraph Iines are frozen... It is
impossibIe to get in touch with nobody.
We must pray that the
storm hit there earIier...
...and that the chiIdren saw it and
did not Ieave their pIaces, inshaIIah.
There is nothing we can do, but
be patient and wait right now.
If you Iook at the mater from a
positive aspect, Headmaster...
...at Ieast the chiIdren
aren't carying anyhing!
Come on Iads! Come on.
Those who are in the rear,
hoId on to those in front of you.
Papa... Papa, Iet's go.
Munire!
We waited. We waited the
whoIe day for some news...
AII through the day, with the hours
seeming Iike centuries, we heard nothing.
My father and the others wanted to go
up in the mountains and Iook...
However, the governor refused
to Iet any parent Ieave the ciy...
UntiI we receive news about our
chiIdren no one is to Ieave the ciy!
Where wiII you go?
Where wiII you Iook?
Perhaps they don't even
know where they are...
OnIy AIIah knows where they are.
Get up. Get up.
Mehmet...
Get up. Get up.
My boy!
Where is my son?
Come on!..
Where is my Iamb?
Where is my Iove?

And as Iong as the worId
Iasts they wiII not be in vain.
May they rest in peace and Iight!
