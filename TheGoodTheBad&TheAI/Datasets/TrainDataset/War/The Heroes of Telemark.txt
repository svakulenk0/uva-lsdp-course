Los! Runter! Runter vom Wagen!
Major Frick! Major Frick!
Tell the commandant of Rjukan
that an attempt has been made
on the Reich-Comissar's life!
Arrange for 15 civilians
from Telemark to be shot in reprisal!
- Like the look of it, gentlemen?
- Most interesting.
We are well informed
of what you do, Herr Nilssen.
Just experimentation with heavy water.
With deuterium oxide. Yes, we know.
Nilssen, l must tell you...
the time has come to make
a transition from theory to practice.
You've done enough experimentation,
my dear fellow.
This room has more significance for us
than you can possibly realise.
One day perhaps he will realise,
don't you think, gentlemen?
Forget about fertilisers.
This factory is required by the Reich
to increase its production
of heavy water by 400%.
We want 10,000 pounds
of heavy water by Easter next year.
- That's impossible.
- Not at all, Herr Nilssen.
What is necessary
will always be accomplished.
All the more so when the whole future
of the Reich is at stake.
All the technical details
have been worked out in Berlin. Look.
Notice also our modification
of the deuterium formula.
But what is the reason?
l don't understand.
That was a firing squad, my dear Nilssen.
Let it be a warning.
Major Frick will be in charge of security
and it will be the maximum.
Halt!
Papiere!
Ja.
Stupid fool!
Doctor Pedersen?
Sorry, he's busy.
He's working in the darkroom.
You can't go barging in
on Professor Pedersen.
How long is he likely to be there?
Could be there all afternoon.
l'll wait for him.
Shut that door!
What the hell are you doing?
The red light's on.
l'm sorry. l'd like to speak to you.
Don't you know the damage
you can do barging into a darkroom?
l've got to give you a message.
All right. l'll be in touch.
What do you want?
l come from Telemark,
near the Norsk-Hydro factory.
l didn't ask where you were born.
l come from Chief Engineer Nilssen.
He wants your opinion on something.
He says only you would understand it.
- Understand what?
- The message.
lt's in here.
What's this, some sort of student joke?
lt's not a joke and l'm no student.
lt contains an undeveloped
photographic negative.
Open it.
Who are you?
Knut Straud.
l used to work on the sawmills
but now l fight Nazis.
One of those.
Get back to your sawmill.
l'm not interested in your messages.
My work is here.
You understand?
l've just seen you at your work.
l'd rather embrace one Norwegian
than kill a dozen a day, friend.
Look at this.
Every time you boy scouts blow up
a Nazi truck, 12 hostages are shot.
That's your great work?
Keep it. Get out of here
and take your toothpaste with you.
A lot of ''boy scouts'' risked their lives
to get this to you.
l must get to England.
Moment!
Reiseausweis!
Name?
- Jan Christensen.
- Adresse?
Also Sie fahren jetzt nach Trondheim?
Ja.
We've contacted London.
They're expecting us.
How are we for fuel?
l'm sorry. My wife is a little clumsy.
No, it's my fault.
- How far are you going?
- As far up as she'll go.
- How far will she go?
- We'll make it.
There's 12 crew and eight passengers
plus the quisling.
All we need now is a little fog
and the trolls on our side.
Don't tell me a big boy like you
believes in trolls?
You all know what to do.
Well, Doctor, press this little thing here
and the bullets come out there.
Get off the bridge!
We're taking over this ship in the name
of the Royal Norwegian Government.
- This ship's going to England.
- Like hell it is!
Sail under the King as free men
or be prisoners for the rest of the war.
Good evening.
Stay where you are! We're taking over
this ship in the name of the King.
- Look out!
-
- Quisling bastard!
- Serves him right.
- What can we do for you?
- Hm?
Give us a hand.
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
There's a change in our itinerary.
lnstead of going up the coast
to Kristiansand, we're going to England.
Don't be alarmed.
Now or never, Captain.
Fools. You'll never
get across the North Sea alive.
Enemy planes will spot you.
That's the chance we're going to take.
There are thousands of mines
and neither the British or Germans
happen to have given us a map.
- Do you believe in trolls?
- Yes, he does.
So do l -
providing we've a sharp lookout.
England, Captain?
- South-sou'west.
- South-sou'west, sir.
Thank you, Captain.
Mines!
Mines!
- Full astern.
- Full astern, sir.
Hard aport!
- What's all the commotion?
- There's a mine.
- Stop engines.
- Stop engines, sir.
- Slow ahead both.
- Slow ahead both.
Too close. You trying to blow us up?
Get that pole.
- Full astern.
- Full astern, sir.
Hang on this line.
Next time you want
to play billiards with a mine,
remember my job is
to get you safely to London.
Passes, sir.
What the devil is heavy water?
lt's a liquid with a heavier hydrogen
structure than ordinary water.
lt possesses properties
useful in atomic energy.
What's the significance of the Germans
ordering this vast increase?
ln the formula that Nilssen sent,
the Germans have added
a new component to the equation...
Wait till that formula's been examined
by Professor Einstein
and Dr Oppenheimer in New York.
Surely it's something more than just
a doubt that brought you to England?
lt is. lt's a very great fear.
lf it's justified,
we'll know about it soon enough.
Thank you.
l'll lead the way, shall l?
Morning, George, Charlie.
A moment, gentlemen, would you mind?
Thank you so much.
This is Professor Sir Roderick Logan.
Gentlemen, perhaps l should tell you -
or perhaps l should not tell you -
that we have just come from
a very brief and very painful session
with the Prime Minister on this.
Ah.
At any rate, here is the report that came
from Washington this morning.
Following their initial reading
of the data brought by Dr Pedersen,
plus certain other indicators -
incidentally, Professors Einstein,
Fermi and Oppenheimer concurring,
the scientific and military consensus
in America is...
that the Germans may be ahead of us
in the race to achieve
controlled atomic fission.
lf they are ahead
and they get their atomic bomb...
they've won the war.
There you are, Knut.
How are you? Come in.
- Come in, Mr Straud.
- Thank you.
- Come on in. Take a chair.
- Thank you.
We've examined the situation carefully
and it's been agreed
in London and Washington
that the factory making heavy water
must be destroyed.
l agree with you, Bill, that bombing
is the most obvious method.
At the same time, we wish, if we can,
to avoid large-scale civilian death,
which is also the wish
of the Norwegian government.
l suggest that Dr Pedersen,
who knows what's at stake,
and Mr Straud,
who knows his country backwards,
be asked to return to Telemark
in order to resolve this question.
That is to determine, with objectivity,
whether a ground attack by commandos
is practical or not.
Agreed?
Agreed.
- How do we get back to Norway?
- The simplest way. By parachute.
We're miles off course
but l know where we are.
lt's beautiful, isn't it?
Yes, if you're a reindeer.
Where do we go from here?
l'm taking you
to one of my radio operators.
He's our contact with London.
Now what?
Over that mountain. A farmhouse.
Another one of my operators.
l know this place.
Oh, Knut Straud!
- Come in. How are you?
- Fine.
Wonderful to see you.
- Hello, Anna.
- Good God, what are you doing here?
Well, just dropped in for a cup of coffee.
Uncle!
- Uncle!
- What is it?
- Rolf is here.
- Oh, damn!
- Hello, Uncle.
- What on earth are you doing here?
Mr Straud, always good to see you.
- You know each other too?
- We've met.
What a surprise. l had no idea
you were all such good friends.
Hadn't you?
You ought to know we've put you
in danger by coming here.
- What?
- We're working for the Resistance.
You? You're not serious?
- Well, he got me into it.
- Was that wise, Knut?
You seem to know each other quite well.
Oh, everybody knows everybody here.
Let me introduce you to my ex-wife.
- Can we have some coffee, Anna?
- l've no time for coffee.
l'm working for the Resistance.
We both can't be working
for the Resistance.
You look terrible.
He's been dragging me around
for two days.
There's pyjamas and hot water upstairs.
Go up to the bedroom.
l take it you know the way?
Yeah, l know the way.
- Follow me.
- Thank you.
lt's odd to have him in the house again.
What's odd about it? You and he
shared the same bed for two years.
As far as l remember,
you damn seldom got out of it.
- You should be asleep.
- l just thought l'd drop in.
All in the line of duty.
To discuss Resistance tactics
with a fellow fighter.
How's your resistance these days?
Fine. How's yours?
Mine?
Well, it was great until l met
that boy scout, Knut Straud.
Well...
l was content, l had a good life...
and now look where l am.
lt's exhausting
to commit yourself to others.
You still commit yourself beautifully.
Like you always did.
l'm not your wife now, Rolf.
l know.
You're not anybody's wife, are you?
- Go to bed.
- Sure.
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
You mean you would?
- You know what you were born for.
- No.
You know what you were born for.
Tell me.
Say those things to me.
Your voice...never out of my head.
You're the same. You're my love...
Yes, you are.
You've got the words wrong, Rolf.
You see, it's not so easy
seducing your ex-wife.
Students are much easier, aren't they?
l just don't believe in you any more.
- Anna...
- Please go.
Please.
Sleep well.
We'll make this our main transmitter hut.
Can't risk the farm.
l'll make sure Nilssen is at the church.
Good.
Uncle, be careful.
The town is full of Germans.
Merry Christmas, Uncle.
See you in church.
Merry Christmas!
Sigrid.
That's Arne's wife?
l've got a message for you from Arne.
- He's in England. He's fine.
- Will you see him again?
l have a message for him too -
he'll be a father in the spring.
They'll have their 10,000 pounds
of heavy water by Easter.
The marker - microfilm of the factory.
Exact details.
Ammonia and hydrogen pipes.
You see how close it is to the village?
Look how near the factory is
to their homes.
Look at the rabbit!
Land mines.
Come on.
Excuse me.
l don't think l've seen you
in Rjukan before. Who are you?
l've come to, er, visit my fiancée...
for Christmas.
l see. Your fiancée.
How very charming indeed.
And what is his name?
- My name...
- l'm asking her.
Jan Christensen.
Mm-hm.
Let me see your identity card, please.
Certainly.
Excuse me.
Here it is.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Your text, l believe?
Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Auf wiedersehen.
Oh, and the compliments
of the season to both of you.
- How did you like our town, Rolf?
- l liked it.
You should have seen
the torch-light parades we used to have.
Yes. Every November.
Flaming torches. You could see it
from miles away in the mountains.
- The snow was whiter then.
- Yes.
lt was all the lights on the snow.
Then we made snowballs and threw
them at the torches. Remember, Knut?
This is a detailed layout
of the factory.
They've got 3,000 pounds of heavy water
ready to be shipped to Germany.
Let's decide on what message
we send to London.
There's only one message.
We've examined the area. Consider
ground attack totally impractical.
Recommend alternate method.
You mean to bomb it?
Yes.
lt would destroy Rjukan
and everybody in it.
Possibly.
Bombing is impossible. The factory
is deeply embedded in a gorge.
The one way across that gorge
is a narrow bridge 75 feet long.
Two men could hold off a battalion.
l can get inside that factory with ten men
and blow it sky-high!
They've got 88mm guns on every hill.
And without destroying
an entire village in the process.
Barbed wire, land mines.
- 6,000 lives. Do you realise...?
- Anna, keep out of this.
This is something that affects the world.
l don't give a damn about the world.
l'm talking about my town,
her town, his town. We live there.
l'm talking about people.
Do you understand? People!
You weren't so squeamish
when hostages were being shot.
lt's more important than a few trucks...
- l was doing my job.
- And l'm doing mine!
l don't like it and l didn't ask for it.
Anna...
you live here, it's natural you want
to save your own people's lives but...
this is something that has to be done.
lt's important.
lmportant enough to kill 6,000 people?
Yes.
Look...
l want to know what's so important
about heavy water.
l don't make the rules. l can't tell you.
l want to know
and you're going to tell me.
l'm telling you nothing.
Do you think that l'm going to sacrifice
the lives of 6,000 people
on the opinion of a playboy scientist?
For what? l want to know
and you're going to tell me.
You want to know what it's all about?
All right. l'll tell you.
That's what it's all about.
You understand?
- Of course you don't.
- Why, you...!
Stop it! Stop it!
l thought you boys
were here to fight the Nazis.
Why don't you both send in reports
and let London decide?
- All right.
- Fine.
See, Anna?
Knut and l fight but we still manage
to live with each other.
l know you're anxious
to get back to Norway.
Knut Straud and Rolf Pedersen are
on the mountains of Telemark waiting.
The main assault group -
the Royal Engineers Commando -
will come in two or three days.
We're counting on you to get
a glider landing strip on the lake ready.
Well, happy landings. Best of luck.
Where have you been? We've been
halfway round the Arctic Circle!
We've been waiting for your message
for five weeks and it hasn't come!
- l'm starving!
- We're expecting company tomorrow.
- 50 commandos.
- They land tomorrow.
l've got a message for you from Sigrid.
You're going to have a baby
in the spring!
- How is she?
- She's pregnant.
Rolf!
- Who are you?
- My name is Jensen.
- What do you want?
- l'm on a hunting trip.
Hunting for what?
You'd better come with us.
l won't say a word. Ever.
On my honour.
Look...
My village is Hochlai.
Anyone there will tell you who l am.
l hate the Nazis, believe me.
My wife is in a Gestapo prison.
Listen. Her father's name is Yon Trend.
- That's why she's in prison.
- Trend?
- The Resistance leader?
- Yes.
lt fits.
Shoot him.
We'll keep him.
You can't risk the whole organisation
because of one man.
- l'm with Knut.
- l think Rolf is right.
So do l.
We'll have a show of hands.
Those against shooting him.
We'll have your skis. Take them off.
Listen.
l still can't believe it.
- They weren't even Norwegian.
- 50 British commandos.
ln a flash, the whole operation's over.
The waste. That's what
l can't get out of my head.
They're not going to be wasted.
We're going ahead. Tonight. Now.
As if they were with us.
- lt's the same plan. We all know it.
- What are you talking about?
We're going to complete
the mission ourselves.
- Knut, you're mad.
- We'd better wait.
lt'll be months before
they can mount a similar assault.
- Knut...
- lt's our only chance.
lf we win, those men won't have died
for nothing tonight.
There were 50 of them. Only nine of us.
- You won't even be nine.
- What do you mean?
l'm sorry, but l'm not going on
such an impossible mission.
Oh yes, you are, Rolf.
You're coming with us.
You're the only one who knows exactly
where that dynamite must be placed.
After tonight, that factory's
going to be jumping with guards.
- He's right.
- Now listen! Listen to me!
They have completely wiped out
our entire assault force, right?
- They'll be feeling safe.
- You don't have a chance.
They came here to help us.
They weren't even Norwegian.
Well...who's coming with me tonight?
lt's ten to 12. This is an operation
launched by the British.
We'll wear British uniforms
so the Germans won't shoot hostages.
The attack will take place at 3:15.
Arne, you and Henrik
will be our cover party.
You'll cut a hole in the fence.
The demolition party will consist...
The demolition party
will consist of Knut, Oli and myself.
Jensen? lnside.
- Gute Nacht.
- Draußen ist's kalt.
Gut, ich bin warm angezogen.
Hello...
Hello.
Fritz, mach die Tür zu!
Be careful with those wires.
You will blow the whole place up.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
- Let's get out of here.
- My glasses! l've lost my glasses.
- They're on your head.
- What's going to happen to me?
We'll put you somewhere safe.
Scheinwerfer jetzt da! Lass sie nicht...
Go on. Go on.
Gentlemen, your next mission
is to find out how neutral Sweden is.
Especially the girls.
Where's Arne?
Down in the gorge.
Let's get going.
lt'll be swarming with Germans
in half an hour.
Excellent.
Excellent work.
ls it not, my dear Nilssen?
An extraordinary job, you might say,
of sabotage.
Naturally, you had no knowledge of this.
Destruction, sabotage, waste.
All this is against
your thrifty scientific nature.
ls it not, Nilssen?
ln that case, answer me this.
How long before production
gets back into high gear?
A year at least -
new containers have to be built,
a new store
of heavy water accumulated -
before production flows at full speed.
A year, he says.
What do you think we Germans
have been doing? Sleeping?
What do you think your friends from
the Berlin lnstitute have been doing?
Playing golf?
The British fancy themselves very much
after what they've done here.
Winston Churchill is puffing
an extra big cigar today.
And we laugh at him.
Why?
Because all these containers
which the British did so much to destroy
have already been
prefabricated...in Berlin.
They are on their way here
and will be installed tomorrow.
l must say that is fantastic efficiency.
Don't ever make the mistake
of underrating the Germans.
By Easter, we will not have
but 12,000 pounds of heavy water.
Because from now on, no one leaves
this building - not you or anybody -
unless it's to go
to Grini concentration camp.
l must protest against this.
Protest as much as you wish...
but get used to the idea!
You built this place.
You will work now in it, eat in it
and sleep in it until our victory.
Heil Hitler.
Major Frick.
This is one of the most disastrous
security breakdowns of the entire war
and you are responsible for it.
l leave you in charge of the only factory
in Europe making heavy water
and a dozen men in British uniforms
calmly walk in
and blow it up right in front of your eyes.
So get up into those mountains!
And get back every one of those men.
Dead or alive.
lf it turns out they're Norwegians,
l want a hundred hostages
rounded up and shot.
l don't want even a rat left alive up there!
Go on, get out!
Fertig machen! Abmarschieren!
Einsteigen! Abfahren!
Mit voller Ausrüstung.
You say you can take us to them?
You'd better be telling the truth.
You keep your part of the bargain,
l'll keep mine.
You were right.
We should have shot that quisling...
Forget it.
Abteilung 2 da lang.
Der Rest folgt mir nach.
Knut, go down that side.
Why?
Why?
My wife...
Your wife? What the hell do you mean,
your wife?
l made a bargain with the Nazis.
Who are you?
l was helping track down the saboteurs.
l got hurt in the foot.
You'd better come with us.
Abteilung vorwärts!
Abteilung halt! Wegtreten!
Saboteurs, going to
Grini concentration camp.
l...l think l'd better go see my doctor.
Thanks for your help.
Hey, wait a minute.
We have a doctor here now.
Come and see him.
l'd rather see my own
if it's all the same to you.
Oh, nonsense. Our doctor will look after
you for nothing. Why pay a civilian?
- Who is this fellow?
- One of the men helping our patrols.
lf he's helping us, we must help him.
- Thank you.
- That's only fair.
Nasty. We'd better have that seen to.
Herr Sturmführer!
l think we have got another person
for your bus.
Doctor?
- You remember me?
- No, l don't.
We met at the university, Dr Pedersen.
- l'm afraid you're mistaken, madam.
- You know this man?
No, l... l thought l did but l... No.
What did you say his name was?
No, please. l don't know.
His papers say Christensen.
What did you say?
His name!
My name is Dr Rolf Pedersen,
University of Oslo.
As Gestapo Headquarters will no doubt
be delighted to confirm.
Doctor...
l'm so sorry.
- Pederson...
- Pedersen, not Pederson.
l'm very proud of my name.
Let me help you. Here it is.
''Pedersen, Rolf. Doctor of Physics.
Believed escaped to England.''
- England?
- Even the Gestapo can be wrong.
Schnell! Schnell!
How long will it be, Doctor?
l've got to leave here.
Can you hear me, Doctor?
l can't stay here long.
l don't want to know who you are
but if you leave you'll be arrested
and so will l and my staff.
You will therefore stay here
until l make the arrangements.
Anna, l told you l don't want
you using that transmitter set.
- London must know where Rolf is.
- l can't risk it.
Why can't you try to find him?
l'm not a member
of the Missing Person's Bureau.
l can't jeopardise the whole operation.
l am a bad ex-wife, Knut.
Why? Because you love him?
Yes. You haven't much use for that,
have you?
Not in this sort of war. lt softens you up.
But sex - now, that's something different.
lt seems Rolf makes
the same distinction.
But you don't, do you, Anna?
l'll get some wood.
They're in this area somewhere.
Leave that alone! Not for anyone!
Do you understand?
That transmitter remains silent
until l give the order!
You see, Anna,
that's what l was talking about.
- Morning.
- Hello, Doctor.
A friend of yours is here.
Room seven, down the corridor.
- Sigrid.
- Hello, Dr Pedersen.
l thought you were locked up
in the factory.
We are, unless we're very ill.
Or having a baby.
- There's something l've got to...
- Nilssen found out you were here.
Listen to me.
- l've got to tell you about Arne.
- l know.
The Germans
have installed new containers,
so heavy water production
is at full level again.
- Sigrid...
- When can you deliver the message?
Right now.
- We've got to contact London.
- Why? What's the matter?
The Nazis have restored
heavy water production.
- What?
- lt's taken two weeks, not two years.
We're back where we started.
Then we'll have to bomb.
We'll have to take his appendix out.
ln that case one of our security officers
must remain with him day and night.
l shan't be lonely. By the way,
how are Sigrid and her baby?
Excellent. She's bringing him here later
for a check-up.
- l'd love to see her.
- No one can communicate with Nilssen.
''67 civilians killed.
Factory virtually untouched.
''The Nazis...''
The Third Reich is going to last
for a thousand years.
Let's all go to Rjukan. Have a good
Nazi dinner, see a nice Nazi film.
- Rolf.
- Start getting used to it.
''The Nazis are shipping
all their heavy water to Germany
''by rail and ferry under the guard
of a thousand troops.
''The railway tank cars will leave
the factory Saturday evening.
''Be placed...on the Hydro ferry...
Sunday morning.''
And Nilssen lost his appendix
to deliver that.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute..
Maybe now -
the very moment we've all dreaded
when they take the stuff to Germany...
by ferry.
This is where we get them.
But, Rolf, a thousand troops?
But there's one place
you can't use a thousand troops.
Knut, do you want to do
a little dying with me?
l've just thought up a nice way to go.
lt left at nine o'clock.
lt's got to be the deepest point -
at least three, four hundred metres.
Now.
You know what we're talking about?
Yes. We're talking about murder.
Why two clocks?
lf one doesn't go off, the other will.
To sink the ferry in less than a minute.
lt has to be done, Anna.
lt's all been calculated, hasn't it, Rolf?
Nothing left to chance.
Not even the hope
that one child won't drown.
Anna, what counts isn't
who's going to die in the ferry
but how many millions
will be saved if the ferry's sunk.
A nice equation, Rolf.
Put it on the blackboard and sign it.
lt's not a ''nice'' equation.
l didn't invent it. lt exists.
So do people. People exist too.
We're doing this for people!
You don't do things for people.
Anna, this work is tough enough
even without you.
One day, after the war,
a woman is going to ask
why her child had to be drowned.
l won't know the answer.
lt's simple as this - we have no choice.
What are you going to say
to that woman, Rolf?
We'll radio the Norwegian government
in London.
Tell them the plan, all its risks...
The Prime Minister, the King -
the whole lot.
Then, if they approve...
at least we've shared the responsibility.
lt works.
Let's contact London.
Number one truck reports a contact
on 247 degrees.
Contact 73 degrees.
West south-west.
Six kilometres from here.
All right, Heine!
Shut that door, will you?
- That's better.
- l'm glad you think so.
Stand up!
lf we're not back in two hours,
don't wait for us.
lf you hear any shots, leave immediately.
Another one.
There is nine minutes left.
- Go on to the boathouse with Knut.
