In ancient times, the world was
ruled by gods and monsters.
But it was the half-god Perseus,
my son...
...who defeated the Kraken
and saved humanity.
For his courage, I offered him
a place to rule at my side.
strong-willed
and chose a different path
...he would not pray for help, from me...
...or the other gods.
But the son of Zeus cannot hide
from his destiny forever.
New pull it in. Dc it again.
Throw in the other one real quick.
Go on. I'll tie this off.
Goad catch today, Dad.
- Where'd you get that?
- I made it myself.
You made it yourself? Heh.
I want to be a good god
and do good things.
There's no such thing as good gods.
Some of them are good.
Ah. Helius, there's more to life
than gods and Titans.
Hey, Clea. I have a confession to make.
I, uh, needed him for chores
so he skipped studying.
Now, you do a good jab, make me proud.
{THUNDER RUMBLING}
I know you're here.
I visit him sometimes in his dreams.
He's like his father. A strong-willed bay.
You just passing through?
Na.
I need your help...
...Perseus.
You're the great god Zeus.
You don't need my help.
There is a calamity coming.
It will affect us all. Gods and men.
- The humans may have stopped praying to us...
- With good reason.
...but there are consequences.
Without prayer, we gods lose our power.
When our power leaves us,
all our work comes undone. All of it.
{RUMBLING}
The walls of Tartarus are falling.
It is emptying all its demons onto the earth.
The first are already here.
If our power diminishes much further,
we gods will became mortal.
We will die and Kronos himself will escape.
It will mean chaos. The end of the world.
What am I meant to do?
This is business for gods.
We need all our children now.
Perhaps, together...
...we can remedy this.
But we need every shred of power, Perseus.
I will never leave my sun.
I know your heart better
then you know it yourself.
You believe your human half
makes you unworthy to join us.
You will learn someday that...
...being half-human...
...makes you stranger than a god,
not weaker.
I think you should go.
Sleep well, Perseus.

I need to speak to my father.

Are you becoming weak?
You're in the underworld, Ares,
where it's wise to obey me.
You forget our father once tried to kill us.
Na, I remember everything.
And what exactly does our father want from us
in return for our precious immortality?
We simply offer him the last of your
divine powers so that he may free himself.
Oh, Hades.

If it is action you're after, you are a little late.
I'm just here to see Queen Andromeda.
This is a battlefield.
- I am in command here.
- Uh-huh.
Well, I wish to speak to the queen.
And the queen wishes to speak to you.
Your Majesty.
Came an.
Hail Perseus.
You've obviously been
in your own battles, Perseus.
I've been busy with mine.
Yeah, you have.
I won't keep you.
It's been tan lung.
- I have a sun now.
- I know. I'd like to meet him.
And my wife, she...
- I know.
I'm sorry.
Your Majesty.
For the sake of the men, we must
resolve our differences before sunset.
I made it clear we continue to fight...
...the Chimera invaders.
Today in the field we last 300 men...
...for the death of four Chimera. We have...
offended the gods. We need to pray.
You'd pray to Ares, perhaps?
As soldiers always have.
What if I was to tell you that Ares
is your enemy now?
I would make peace with him.
You would make peace with the god of war?
Perseus.
What's your strategy?
There's a way we can end this,
and then I can get home.
What is this far?
- It's to cut the cars for my trireme.
I need 110 cars...
...for the three rows...
...one oar per man.
This lacks like a pick.
- It is, however, the rudder for my flagship.
Quiet!
Morning checks, Your Majesty.
Always eventful.
Oh, Your Majesty. Ah. Sc good to see you.
- This is Agenor. He's a liar and a thief.
I know it didn't work out between us...
...but, please, do try and get over it.
Have you ever had a woman
love you so much...
...she lacks you up like a pet rabbit?
He wanted my hand in marriage.
When I refused, he tried to run away
with the crown jewels.
I think it's my extraordinary eyes.
Actually, you gut the eyes of your father.
Do you know his father?
Yeah, Agenor here...
...he's the son of the great god Poseidon.
{CHUCKLES}
Your new boyfriend is clearly insane.
I'm your cousin, Agenor.
I'm the sun of Zeus.
Half-god and abandoned just like you.
If my father sent you...
...I want nothing to do with you.
Your father is dead.
Gods don't die.
They do now.
Goad. Could you do me a favour?
Anything.
- Go to hell.
That's exactly where I'm going.
I just need information.
Your father told me...
...that you could help me
get to the Fallen One.
You long for the ocean, don't you?
It's like a thirst you cannot quench.
It must be hell for you in here.
I want a royal pardon.
Granted.
{CHUCKLES}
I want my body weight in gold.
Granted.
Few gold coins, you're so scrawny.
Let me see. What else have I dreamt of
as I lay here in my cell?
Don't push it.
I'm going to need a boat, your fastest boat.
The Fallen One lives far across the ocean.
Where?
Well, put me on the deck of the boat
and I'll show you.
Your ship awaits.
Fetch my lucky cape.
Do you know why
this is my lucky cape, me old mate?
Because the first time I ware it,
I sprouted a beard. A full-grown beard.
Send ward to every regiment...
...that's still intact to gather here
at the Tyrene pass.
If I'm not there in two days...
...then you can pray.
Your Majesty.
Regroup at the garrison!
You can't leave...
...Greece without a queen.
Are you giving me orders now?
Unchain him.
Show me where the Fallen One is.
Who is the Fallen One?
Oh, the god Hephaestus.
Heh, heh.
And who's Hephaestus?
Hephaestus was the god
that made Poseidon's trident...
Hades' pitchfork...
...and Zeus' thunderbolt.
Put those together...
...they farm the Spear of Trium,
the weapon the gods used...
to defeat Kronos.
But Hephaestus lives on the island of Kail.
Ha-ha-ha.
Which no one has ever found.
Kail doesn't exist, does it, Agenor'?
It dues...
...exist. I can take you.
Unchain me and give me the trident.
If you unchain him, he'll jump off
this boat, you'll never see him again.
Hephaestus can help you save your father.
Don't let our family dawn.

What is it?
I dun'! know.
But whoever did this doesn't want us here.
We have no choice.

...right here for the gods.
You must be able to help us.

Don't you...
...walk away from me.

tank it away from me...
...when I sided with Hades
in their little family argument.
Yes, I know new it was a mistake!

In the beginning, Hades was wise...
...and just and strung.
It were your daddy became drunk an power.
We were even hoping...
when Zeus came he might see
his mistake and restore our...
Why not? He might have, had he came.
{RUMBLING}
I'm sorry...
...that you think being human
is not enough. But we humans...
hope when there's no hope.
And we believe when to believe is idiotic.
But sometimes, in spite...
of everything, we prevail.
Now...
...which of you two...
...is in charge?
- I am.
- Then...
...if we were gods...
...how would you help us free Zeus?
Oh, my dear.
You remind me of someone.
Aphrodite.
She was my wife.
Came with me.
If Zeus is captive in the underworld...
...he's likely being held
in the heart of Tartarus.
There can't be much time
before his life farce...
...is completely sapped.
But how do we get to him?
We can't.
Normally you'd be right, young man.
But when I designed this marvel...
...I included a secret passage, a shortcut...
...if you will.
- You designed Tartarus?
Oh, aye.
And built it.
Aphrodite, I could...
not only get you inside...
...I could give you a guided tour.
In order for the prison of Tartarus...
...to be completely impregnable...
...I built it from the outside in.
So I had to leave a passage
for me self to get cut...
...when the work was done.
And this labyrinth...
...is the only way a human
can travel through the underworld...
...and get to the heart of Tartarus.
Where's my snarling bastard of a sun Ares?
Will Kronos really spare him'?
And you?
Is there no end to this?
I'm afraid, brother.
Is that what you want me to say?
I'm a god and I'm afraid.
Well, you should be.
When your precious humans die,
at least their souls go to another place.
When a god dies, it isn't death.
It's just absence.
It's nothing.

- Na.

He's the one who taught me to navigate.
That, and haw to seduce a mermaid...

but came in handy more often...

to the labyrinth.

They've given us a chance.
Brother!
{PERSEUS YELLS}
{CHEERING}
He's waiting for you...
before he goes.
Your bay gave you strength.
Yes.
As did mine.
Perhaps Hades can heal you.
He already gave me my last chance.
And you sacrificed it for him.
There will be no more sacrifices.
Na more gods.
Use your power wisely, Perseus.
Thank you, my sun.
All my power is spent.
Who knows?
I might be stranger without it.
I know it's brake. Na need to tell me.
I could walk an it, but...
My mum always said...
...you should let everyone have
their moment to shine. You know?
So, you know, I'm established.
I've already got a name.
You know? The Navigator.
If I'm not mistaken...
- ... you're the son of Perseus
- I am Helius.
Is that your bay, Helius?
{MOUTHS}
Go over there!
Helius!
Came here.
I've got a story to tell. Came and meet...
your Uncle Navigator.
I'm Agenor.
Helius.
I've read that you are
a great disappointment.
That's right, I am great.
This is my nurse, Tiger.
We have to be prepared
if there's another attack.
We're fortifying Argos
with the third regiment.
Our engines will be ready in two days,
so in the west we can...
Dad...
...I'm actually lacking forward
to going home.
I've decided being a baring fisherman
isn't that bad.
You know we can't go back home.
Take it.
You're Helius.
You're sun of Perseus...
...the grandson of Zeus.
Take it.
It's heavy.
Yeah, it is.
Is it too much?
Na.
