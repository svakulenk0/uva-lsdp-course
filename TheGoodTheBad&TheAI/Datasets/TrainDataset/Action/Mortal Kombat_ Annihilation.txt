NARRATOR:
Mortal Kombat is not about death...
...but rather the preservation of life.
Liu Kang and a few chosen fighters
from the Earthrealm...
...defeated Outworld sorcerer
Shang Tsung.
According to rules of Mortal Kombat...
...their victory preserved the safety
of the Earth for one more generation.
Our chosen ones were returned
to Liu Kang's home on Earth...
...only to enjoy a brief period of peace.
For someone from Outworld
has a different point of view.
Shao-Kahn, emperor of Outworld.
The Earth was created in six days...
...so too shall it be destroyed.
And on the seventh day...
...mankind will rest in peace!
This is not good.
Somehow,
he's opened gateways to your world.
I thought our victory in Mortal Kombat
closed those portals.
-What closes can open again.
-What's that supposed to mean?
Mother.
-You're alive.
-Too bad you will die.
As long as l have the power, Kahn,
you will never rule this world.
As long as the portal remains open...
...your world becomes my world.
You will never win.
Master.
This ends now.
You hide behind a human?
KAHN:
Why not, Lord Rayden?
You hid behind them
your entire pathetic life.
-Aah!
-No, Johnny!
Surrender, Rayden, or this one dies.
RAYDEN:
Then l will take your generals.
Because Earth does not bend
to the will of tyrants.
You who would never let one
of your precious humans die.
Trade me for Johnny Cage.
Come bow at my feet.
You fool.
Johnny!
In six days, you will all bow to me!
It has begun!
-We can't let Kahn get away with this.
-This is not a fight we can win.
KAHN:
Annihilate them.
We must go.
Move back.
RAYDEN:
Kahn has opened the portal.
Your planet and Outworld
have begun to merge into one realm.
Think of it as hell on Earth.
My mother, resurrected.
How is that possible?
If l'm correct, your mother, Sindel,
is the key to all of this.
This can't be. We won the tournament.
The rules say the Earth is safe
for another generation.
Obviously, Kahn has cheated
and broken the rules.
He has resurrected your mother
to keep these portals open indefinitely.
By reuniting you with her,
Kahn's spell will be broken.
Your mother's soul will be at peace...
...and his portals closed.
-How could the Elder Gods allow this?
RAYDEN: I do not know.
But Kahn must be stopped
or your world will perish.
We have six days until annihilation.
I beat Shang Tsung. l can beat Kahn.
Yes, you beat a great sorcerer
to win the tournament...
...but you're no match for Kahn.
If anyone's going to kill Kahn,
it's going to be me.
Enough.
You are far from ready.
When those portals open...
...Kahn's extermination squads
will be everywhere, hunting you.
I am telling you this for your own good.
Kahn knows I have no powers
in Outworld.
As the two realms merge,
I will lose my powers here on Earth.
Each of you must grow
stronger together.
We are the only hope.
Together, we couldn't even save Johnny.
What do these do?
Once inside the velosphere, you can travel
to anywhere on Earth in mere hours.
The inner winds propel you.
You'll be moving so fast,
it'll be as though you're not moving at all.
Whoa.
We need your help, Sonya.
I will take you to find your partner, Jax.
Forget it. If l die, that's fine,
but I'm not losing anybody else.
Alone, you are vulnerable,
but if you work together as a team...
...you can do much.
What about us?
The two of you will travel
to the Hopi Mesa.
You did great last time, but you will
need help for what you are about to face.
Go deep into the night.
Seek out the counsel
of one called Nightwolf.
You will not find him. He will find you.
I will speak with the Elder Gods...
...and l will demand answers
for what Shao-Kahn has done.
-Ready?
SONYA: Ready.
RAYDEN:
Here we go.
-They are faster than l remember.
-Can't wait.
-This is amazing.
-Hot air rising from the Earth's core.
We've harnessed its energy.
-What's going on? Where are we?
-The interchange. Roll to your right. Hard.
Hold on to me. Hold on to me.
Father, the merger has begun.
Earth is under attack.
And it is glorious!
Tell me, did you make Rayden beg
for his life before destroying him?
Rayden is of no concern to us.
You let him live?
He could not be stopped.
I have no use for excuses.
I have broken the sacred rules
to keep the portals open.
If the Elder Gods learn of our plot...
...we shall both suffer the consequences.
I do not understand.
How can you fear the Elder Gods?
With control of the Earthrealm,
our power will be absolute.
Until the sixth day has passed...
...we can take no chances
with Rayden and his mortals.
Do not underestimate
the power of the human spirit.
Liu, if anything happens to me,
I want you to--
Kitana...
...l have lost everything...
...and l'm not going to lose you too.
Liu, the missile.
You must go. There will be others.
I killed you in the tournament.
You killed my older brother.
-So why did you help us?
-l helped her.
Because legend has it the princess
is the key to stopping Kahn's plot.
You've been following us. Why?
Two days ago, Kahn reprogrammed Smoke
to come after you instead of me...
...in order to keep you apart
from Queen Sindel.
All right.
So how do we get to Nightwolf now?
KlTANA:
We have a common enemy, Sub-Zero.
You must help us with your powers
if you want to stop Kahn.
Let's hope you succeed.
Get over here.
Take it.
Suckers!
Kitana!
I've got to find Kitana.
Kahn wants you to go after her.
-Don't.
-You don't understand.
Without Kitana, it's over. We've lost.
What happened here should prove
you are not ready for what's ahead.
You'll take the same track back
and turn where l showed you.
Don't worry about me.
Is it like this everywhere?
With each hour,
the merger of the realms grows closer.
More of the Earth will be destroyed.
I will meet you
at the temple of the Elder Gods.
SONYA:
Jax.
Jax. Jax.
Hey, I thought l was supposed
to be rescuing you.
Yeah, well, l couldn't wait.
What the hell have you done to yourself
this time?
Cybernetic strength enhancers.
It takes what you've got,
quadruples the muscle capacity.
You've got a real confidence problem,
you know that?
These locks must be on some kind
of a remote access mechanism.
What's going on? What you doing here?
Everybody split. The facility is going
to be trashed by an extermination squad.
Extermination squad?
What do you mean extermination squad?
All you need to know is they're trying
to kill me and you too.
I don't even know these dudes.
Where you been anyway?
Damn it. I can't get you free, Jax.
All right, stand back, stand back.
Let's see what l'm made of.
Yeah. Now, that's what I'm talking about.
-Wish l had these back in high school.
-You'll wish you were in high school.
-ls that right?
-Come on, Jax, hurry.
JAX:
What the hell is that?
Death is the only way out.
Major Briggs, Sonya Blade,
Shao-Kahn will be pleased.
Shao what?
I'll take homeboy.
I take it this ain't something
we can talk about. Guess not.
Come on. Hah!
Sonya, heads up.
Catch this.
Let's do this.
No.
There we go.
Yeah, now what?
Cybernetic strength enhancers.
Get some.
Nice look, but l'd lose the wall.
JAX:
And l was just getting a feel for it too.
Watch out, Sonya.
Watch out.
Whoa.
Damn, you barbecued his ass.
Look at this.
-Does this mean what I think it does?
-Too bad I didn't get myself new legs.
My squads have already claimed
thousands of innocent souls on Earth.
And l would have claimed millions.
By now, you'd be behind bars
on display in a zoo.
If those bars could keep me away from you,
Sheeva...
...l would welcome them.
KAHN:
Silence.
What is your report?
Two of Earth's best warriors
have already been taken.
Kabal and Stryker.
Tell me, did you make them beg
for their lives before you destroyed them?
-But, master, l thought if I let them live--
-l have no use for excuses.
Rain, this will never happen again.
It will never happen again.
It is true, this will never happen again.
It is also true l need a new general.
You can die in duty or by my hand.
The choice is yours.
Centaurs are known
for their hunting prowess.
As your general, l will personally
hunt down every human soul...
...and spare no one.
Motaro can't be trusted.
Long ago, I proved myself...
...as the personal protector
of Queen Sindel.
Your orders are mine to follow.
The energies they waste
with their sniveling...
...l will use to capture souls for you.
No.
You are all far too impetuous
for such important work.
You are my new general, Queen Sindel.
Unless anyone else
has a different point of view.
Pretty cool, huh?
It's my animality.
-Who are you?
-Wouldn't you like to know?
So you're Rayden's prodigy.
I've seen better.
Don't sweat it. I've seen worse too.
If you are Nightwolf,
you know I won Mortal Kombat.
Don't get cocky.
The tournament had rules.
This time, anything goes.
It was a mistake even coming here.
NIGHTWOLF:
You think you're ready, Liu Kang...
...but if you were,
would Kitana have been captured?
Can you help me get her back?
Maybe. Kitana is important.
But to beat Shao-Kahn,
you've got to pass three tests.
First one's courage.
I don't have time for these stupid games.
To test your courage
and find your animality...
...you've got to put yourself
in a dream state.
And just how am l supposed to do that?
Well, there's a slow way
and there's a fast way.
-We don't have time for the slow way.
-That's what I thought you'd say.
Sweet dreams, Liu Kang.
KlTANA: l had faith in you, Liu Kang,
but you have failed me.
-Kitana.
-You are not the warrior I thought you were.
What if I fail you?
What if I fail everyone?
Your brother's soul is mine.
No!
NIGHTWOLF:
Fight from the inside, Liu.
It's the fire inside of you...
...your everlasting faith in yourself...
...that can never be defeated.
Liu Kang,
the fire that burns inside you is guilt.
You lost Kitana.
You are not a leader.
NIGHTWOLF:
Find that power inside you.
Feel your animality.
KAHN:
You will fail!
I am Jade.
I have searched the mesa for you,
Liu Kang.
Of all the horrors darkness holds...
...to die alone...
...that is my worst fear.
With you, Liu Kang, l'm not afraid.
This is almost too good to be true.
The same could be said about you.
No.
My heart belongs to another.
I can't.
There's not much time left.
Is this just another dream?
How can you beat Shao-Kahn
when l alone am too much for you?
First you betray me, now you laugh?
You are even more pure and faithful
than l heard.
You have passed the test, Liu Kang.
A test?
This was just another one
of Nightwolf's crazy tests?
We could have killed each other.
But we live.
-l will lead you to the temple of Elder Gods.
-l can't.
If this was just a test, it was only
his second. l'm not ready yet.
Not ready to save Kitana?
Because she is the key to all of this.
And l can take you to where she's kept.
-She's alive?
-For now, yes.
For how long, l cannot say.
We must go.
KAHN:
All your past betrayals, I can forgive.
Kitana, please accept this offering...
...for l do not want your death.
You sorely test my patience.
You destroyed my family.
You drove my mother to kill herself.
I am your enemy forever.
So kill me now, if you dare.
Foolish child.
A struggling worm on a hook
lands a bigger catch than a dead one.
JAX:
No trees, no animals.
Damn, what's going on here?
Nature's dying.
The merger of the realms is almost done.
You keep talking about mergers and realms
and all that...
-...but it don't mean squat to me, all right?
-l can't explain it.
The merger is close,
we've only got a few days left.
Use your imagination.
Use my imagination?
You keep talking to me like that, Sonya,
and l'm gonna split, all right?
You dragged me out the base
with some lunatic killers after us.
Put me in a ball,
take me halfway around the world.
If l'm gonna die today,
at least tell me why.
Nobody told me why Johnny had to die.
What is it with you?
And who the hell is Johnny?
Okay, Sonya, l'm your partner.
If you can't trust me, who can you trust?
-Well, obviously, nobody but me.
-Nobody but you?
Every time you ever needed me,
I was there.
I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere because
of you. l don't even know where l am.
I need to use the restroom,
I ain't got no toilet tissue.
I got metal things on my hands.
Sonya Blade.
Oh!
-Kitana?
-You wish.
I told you these arms was good
at something.
Thanks, Jax.
I....
I owe you one.
I don't know how much longer
I can take this.
But you do look good in mud.
-Jax.
-Well, you do.
Ugh.
I gotta go find a river.
-We better roll. Come on.
-Let's do it.
JAX:
They don't even use parachutes.
I have come to the Eternal Palace...
...because your sacred rules
have been broken.
Shao-Kahn has invaded the Earth.
MALE ELDER GOD: As always, Lord Rayden,
you are granted three questions.
The first must be:
Why was this treachery ever allowed?
FEMALE ELDER GOD:
We do not control the destiny of men.
MALE ELDER GOD: Everyone possesses
the ability to change their fate.
You will stand by
and watch the ruination of Earth?
MALE ELDER GOD: You are correct
in believing Kitana is the key...
...to closing Kahn's portals.
But if I reunite her with Sindel...
...how can l be sure Kahn's portals
will stay closed until next tournament?
FEMALE ELDER GOD: Only when Shao-Kahn
is destroyed will the future be safe.
MALE ELDER GOD:
After living among the humans...
...do you truly believe
they're worth saving?
More than anything l know.
FEMALE ELDER GOD: Do you love them
enough to sacrifice your immortality?
I don't see no street signs, no mailboxes.
Which temple is the Elder Gods'?
Just keep moving, Jax.
-Jax.
-Sonya.
-You know this dude?
-Yeah.
-ls that Jax?
-Yeah. Who is she?
Jade, this is Sonya Blade.
Major Jackson Briggs.
You've got an incredible set of legs...
...for kicking, I mean.
Where's Kitana?
She was kidnapped by Scorpion.
You lost Kitana and you picked up her?
She helped me get here.
Well, thanks to you,
we got extermination squads on our butts.
Can l make a suggestion here?
Let's put this petty stuff aside...
...and start worrying about bigger things,
like staying alive.
He's not here, either.
We just sit and wait for this dude?
Without Rayden, it's hopeless.
Never give up hope.
-At least not so early in the fight.
-Rayden?
It's a new look.
Who's the girl?
Can she fight as good as she looks?
-Heh. Better.
-Good.
I was expecting a team. lnstead,
I hear fighters at war with each other.
Oh, give us a break, Rayden.
We've been through hell.
Compared to what lies ahead,
you've been through nothing.
-Where's Kitana?
-Kahn took her. It's all my fault.
This is not about blame.
We're together in this.
Each of us must help
and support the others, like a family.
What's the deal with your arms?
I've known you one minute
and you're dissing me already?
I mean no disrespect.
You have real skills. Those arms are not
your strength, they're your weakness.
Well, thanks for the tip.
But these things right here,
state of the art.
Faith in yourself is all you need.
And l say that to all of you.
I'll try to open a portal to Outworld
while l still can. Follow me.
My powers are leaving me.
Who does this dude think he is,
Moses parting the Red Sea?
Destroy everything.
Whenever you're ready, Rayden.
Come on.
That was fun.
They have taken the bait...
...and fallen right into our trap.
Proceed as planned.
I'll await your arrival in Outworld.
Oh, man.
My skin is burning up,
but I'm freezing inside.
-Feels like l got microwaved or something.
-You never do get used to that.
My God, is that what l think it is?
RAYDEN:
The realms are merging.
This will continue to happen
unless Kahn's portals are closed.
Time is against us.
-All those people in their cars--
-Torn between realms.
JAX:
It's like a nightmare or something, man.
We have to stop this.
To do that, we must rescue Kitana.
I know Kahn took Kitana
back to his fortress.
Hold up, hold up. Kahn?
You mean Mr. Bad Attitude back there?
You want us to go check out his crib?
Uhn-uhn. No way.
I ain't going on no suicide mission.
Rayden.
Jax is right.
That's probably just what Kahn
wants us to do.
JADE:
No.
There is a secret passageway.
It was the one l used to escape.
You believed that the ruination
of the Elders' temple...
...would not put our plan in jeopardy?
It was necessary to convince the mortals
that their only hope lie in Outworld.
You seem confident that Sindel will capture
Rayden and his mortals in your trap.
I promise you, Father, on my soul.
All the millenniums of planning
will be rewarded.
You will be proud.
Know this:
I will take your soul myself
if you fail me now.
I will rally the extermination squads...
...and prepare for victory.
The merger will soon be complete...
...and all your friends will be dead.
LlU:
This must have been Edenia.
The royal family's temple.
Kitana told me I would find it here.
Look like this babe's
having a bad hair day.
They must have followed us.
Perhaps, but it may be
a blessing in disguise.
We need Sindel
to close Kahn's portals forever.
-l'll take care of her.
-l'll rescue Kitana.
Something finally went right
for a change. We won.
Who finished off Sindel?
After she blasted you,
I surprised her from behind.
Maybe she did come in handy
after all, huh?
You are witness
to the dawning of mankind's final day.
The two realms will be one.
Rayden and his mortals
have fallen for my trick...
...and failed to stop us. Go now.
Bring Rayden and his pathetic mortals
to bow at my feet.
So then with their dying breaths,
they can witness the birth...
...of the greatest army in existence!
Liu.
It's a trap, Liu. Leave.
Up there.
LlU:
Come on.
Liu!
The date's over.
Only your love
can reunite her body and soul.
Kitana, your love can break the hold
Kahn has over your mother...
...and close his portals to Earth.
Oh, Kitana.
I have prayed for the day...
...when our love
will bring us together again.
Love? I have never loved you.
With such a pathetic child as you,
what reason was there to love?
I knew it could not be true.
It cannot be.
Oh, but it can.
And it is.
And you are powerless, thunder god.
It's over. You fools, you've been tricked.
SlNDEL:
The legend was a lie.
Kahn's portals stay open.
JADE:
Now the merger is nearly complete.
How could you do this to us?
It was so easy.
You will die for this, Jade.
-That's it.
JAX: We trusted you, man.
And what happens?
You take us on a wild goose chase.
LlU:
I don't understand.
You were advised by the Elder Gods.
The Gods must have lied to me.
Yo, forget your gods and immortals
and all that junk.
I say the only ones we can trust
from here on out are humans.
Nobody else, not even Rayden.
KlTANA:
Don't you understand?
By leading us here, he is mortal now,
just like you.
All his powers have been sacrificed.
SONYA:
That's even worse.
How do we stop Kahn now?
There's more to this than Kahn.
If Sindel is not the key
to closing Kahn's portals...
...then Kahn has a higher allegiance.
Wait a second.
That tattoo, l've seen it before.
On a robot and a woman.
They both tried to kill me.
And both of them worked for Kahn.
This tattoo is a family crest...
...bestowed only to my bloodline.
It is a permanent mark that allows
safe passage through the portals...
...for the bearer and his passengers.
The tattoos you saw,
did they flee the fighter upon death?
Took off like a bat out of hell.
Temporary passes.
They did not share my bloodline.
But if it's your family crest,
how can Kahn's side have it too?
My father is an Elder God.
And only they
can bestow such a marking.
Your dad's an Elder God?
Funny how you failed
to mention that before.
If your father's an Elder God...
...what does that make Kahn?
Shao-Kahn is my brother.
JADE:
It was not my fault.
I did everything you ordered.
It was your job
to lure them to an ambush.
If they escaped, then you failed me!
We could never
have stopped them alone.
SlNDEL:
Listen to her. She speaks the truth.
We would've died trying.
You....
You are already dead.
And you...
...will be soon.
You will mount a defense
around my newest temple.
Prepare for Rayden
to make one last attack.
You said Rayden
was no longer to be feared.
I am to be feared!
For if you fail me now...
...l will feed your rotting corpse
to the worms!
Your hallowed position
atop the worm pile...
...appears to be most tenuous.
Now your failure will be my opportunity.
You got one dysfunctional family,
you know that?
Years ago, my father decreed...
...that his heir to the family throne
must be strong enough...
...to kill his own brother in battle
if necessary.
I beat my brother...
...but l could not kill him.
Only one thing is certain.
Kahn must die.
This time you're going to kill him.
I could not then.
I cannot now.
So, what do we do?
You will do your best.
It is all that can be expected.
I will pray for you all.
KlTANA:
Listen to me.
Liu is our only hope.
I want to fight Kahn,
but I don't know if l'm ready.
KlTANA:
You must believe in yourself, Liu.
We believe in you.
My home.
KlTANA:
The Temple of the Order of Light.
Your family.
There's so little time left.
Whatever time we have,
we must use well.
Are we really ready to die here?
If we die...
...we will die in battle.
Together.
Prepare for final battle!
RAYDEN:
Kahn!
So good of you to join us, son.
In less than one hour,
the merger of realms will be complete.
Father, you alone have the power
to end this.
Stop!
I do not want
to remember you this weak.
It is not weak to value life!
I offer you one final chance
to return to my side, Rayden.
To rule all realms with your family.
They are my family.
Then you shall die with the rest
of your pathetic human race. Finish him.
You should've killed me...
...when you had the chance, brother.
My brother died a long time ago.
His heart, anyway.
Rayden!
I win, brother.
RAYDEN:
Liu.
You cannot die.
I am proud to die...
...a mortal.
Like you.
This is the beginning of the end.
Show them the way to oblivion!
Mister Ed is mine.
I'll take my mother.
Leftovers are fine with me.
Yeah, l'm gonna make you eat that thing.
I can't take too much more of this.
Is that all you got?
Is that any way to treat your mother?
My mother's dead.
As soon will be her daughter.
That just leaves you and me, Kahn.
Pathetic and weak.
Clearly, Rayden has molded you
in his image.
Yes.
Without your weapons,
you are no match for Motaro.
Jax, help!
I got everything l need right here.
It's over. Yeah.
SONYA:
Help!
JAX:
Get off her.
Yeah.
Get down, Sonya.
-You okay?
-l'm fine.
So you finally
got your confidence back, huh?
Finally asked for help, huh?
Whatever you are,
you will live to see the end of Kahn...
-...to give my mother's soul peace.
-Uhn!
Face it, Liu Kang.
You will fail.
LlU:
I can feel it.
Now I done seen everything.
Impressive.
You've come prepared.
But not good enough.
Your blood flows, Kahn.
Just like the blood of a mortal.
Father, how can this be?
I warned you
there would be consequences...
...for breaking the sacred rules.
But l did not expect this.
Must l do everything for you?
The fate of the universe
will be decided as it should be.
In Mortal Kombat.
Nothing can alter your destiny, nor mine.
I can and l will!
No!
-Yes.
-Yeah.
Kitana.
Oh, Mother.
That was the longest week of my life.
Oh, come on, Jax. Could've been worse.
Could've been the last week of our lives.
Yeah, l guess that's right.
-Hey.
-Yeah?
What's up with that?
Was I dead?
MALE ELDER GOD: It is only right that
Shinnok's son be allowed to take his place...
...in the Eternal Palace.
FEMALE ELDER GOD:
You've become one of us.
I will never forget this moment, Liu.
You've all made me very proud.
I will be watching you...
...so stay out of trouble.
And remember...
...be there for one another.
You're a family now.
