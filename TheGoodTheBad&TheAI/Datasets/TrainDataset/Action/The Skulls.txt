What can I do for you
this a.m.?
We got oatmeal.
We got ham.
We got omelets.
- We got ham omelets.
- I'll have a ham omelet.
More oatmeal, dude.
And try to keep it
the plate this time.
Yeah, dude, more oatmeal.
God, and try to keep it
on the plate this time.
Sometimes you can be
such a bitch.
Fascinating.
Hey, buddy. Come here.
I know it's 8:00 a. m...
and you haven't had
your triple-soy
decaf latte yet,
but a kid with your kind
of breeding should have
some manners.
I suggest you
apologize to the lady.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, sophomores.
You gotta love 'em, huh?
The usual?
Yes.
That would be lovely.
The race is at 4:00 today.
You gonna be there?
I don't know. I've got this
really riveting econ seminar...
on the origins
of the gross national
product, so...
- I wouldn't want to miss that.
- Yeah, I would, actually.
For the lady.
Thank you, sir.
- I'll see you out there.
- Yes, indeed.
The Power Elite.
The main thesis
is what?
Mr. McNamara?
Um, well, actually,
I believe that it's
both, sir.
How can it be both?
It's been my experience...
that merit is
rewarded with wealth,
and with wealth comes class.
Nice car, ladies.
Tell me, when did
you convert?
Since we borrowed it yesterday,
as if you give a shit.
Like you give a shit, man.
I don't believe you, man.
I want you to
keep stealing cars.
When I'm a lawyer, I'm gonna
make a fortune defending
my high school buddies.
Starting with you three.
How you doing,J.J.?
- Your hair looked better long.
- I was thinking the same
about you.
I like it
the way it is.
Thank you.
- I never called you a loser.
- That's okay.
You got your books,
your boats and your
Ivy pride, right?
-
- We'll see you around, buddy.
McNamara, move this boat out
or you're disqualified.
Sorry, sir.
Sorry, I'm late, man.
It's all right.
As long as we're not
late at the finish line.
All hands on.
Ready, shove!
Hoo-rah!
In local sewers, I imagine.
He's a townie.
Mother died in a car crash
when he was one.
Father, unknown.
Ready, row!
He's growing on me.
Is that right?
No need to check
him out, huh?
Caleb,
I can't see the race.
Imagine it.
This is the start
of the Ivy League Sprint.
- Attention.
-
Come on. That's three.
Push your legs. That's four.
Come on.
That's five. Push!
That's eight.
Come on, Luke.
Come on! Nine.
That's ten.
Let's settle.
Lengthen and settle.
That's beautiful, Luke.
Keep it right here, Luke.
That's nice. Looking great.
Don't let them catch us.
Come on!
Come on with the legs!
We got 'em. We're walkin'.
We're four seats ahead.
This race is ours.
- What's going on back there?
- George's oar lock broke.
-
- Okay, George. Out in three.
Toss your oar, George.
One! Two!
Three! Bail!
All right. Take it up!
- Up!
- Take it up. Take it up.
Take it up.
Seven oars against eight?
They don't have a chance
in hell.
Go! Go!
- What do you say, Luke?
- Take it up!
Luke say it's a go.
Come on! Give me two seats.
- Give it all
you got right here!
- Give it!
Right here!
Give it all you got!
We got a seat!
That's it!
We won it! We won it!
You guys are beautiful!
Yeah!
We did it!
He turned them all down.
Either he doesn't want
to join a secret society,
or he's waiting for us.
F-R-double-E
to be S-A-V-E-D
S-A-V-E-D
from the bonds of S-l-N
Glory, glory, hallelujah
hip, hooray, amen
Hallelujah
Go! Go! Go!
Yeah!
Hey. Hey.
What's the matter?
You gonna turn into
a pumpkin at midnight?
Or are you worried
you're not gonna turn
into a Skull?
I'd join the Girl Scouts
if they paid for grad school,
which the Skulls supposedly do.
- Supposedly supposedly.
- I got my Harvard Law
application today.
-
- It's just over three grand
this year.
Damn. Three grand?
Three grand.
Which means that even with
a dozen or so part-time jobs
and my scholarships...
excuse me... I'm still
gonna owe this university
let's say...
hundred grand,
Don't forget interest.
So even if I can get
everything deferred,
I'm gonna owe this school
another, what, 150?
That means you're gonna have to
get one of those corporate law
jobs at 80, 90 hours a week.
And then I could
afford a car!
A used car.
A used car. And you know
how attractive the ladies
find those.
Which means you're getting
no play... even less than now...
which is like...
Like what?
Thanks.
I appreciate that.
So when I finally get free
to practice the kind of law
that I want to practice...
You'll be 10 years from a heart
attack and a few more
from the grave.
Precisely.
My future's killing me.
It's killing me.
Forget about the Skulls.
Start this year off right...
and tell Chloe
how you feel about her.
Let's try to remain
on planet Earth here,
shall we, William?
Chloe went to Miss Porter's,
and I can't even dance.
Chloe's parents...
they own a private jet,
and I've never even
been in a jet.
- You starting
to get the picture?
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I went out with a Skull
freshman year.
How'd you know
he was a Skull?
We got
into this argument...
about secret societies
and how they're different
from fraternities...
because secret societies
are for life.
So I just mentioned
the Skulls, and he got
really uncomfortable...
and left the room
and never came back.
Must be one of their rules.
Rumors are
they got lots of'em.
Rule Number One:
Not picked by midnight
tonight, not in.
Here we go.
Bow your heads...
the Skulls.
It's tough to tell
where the secret society ends
and the university begins.
We know you're up there.
Yeah, we know
you're down there.
But back in World War II,
when they were good guys.
Oh, yeah, the good guys.
Say what you want:
All I know
is that if it's secret...
and it's elite,
it can't be good.
Ahh.
Come on, baby.
What's up? Pizza's
up here. That's what's up.
Hi, Lis.
Hi, Lis.
Hey.
At least now
we can eat, huh?
Yes. Eating.
You're gonna have
a heart attack at 30.
I can see it.
Hello?
Lucas McNamara, please.
May I ask
who's calling?
Luke, it's for you.
He won't say who.
How does anybody
know you're up here?
Our secret must be
out, darlin'.
Shut up.
Hello?
Are you ready
to be reborn?
Who is this?
Pay phone.
Outside Ad building.
Forty seconds.
Who was that?
Luke, hey...
Luke!
The astro lab.
Twenty seconds.
Lose the bike.
Windowsill.
Here we go,
McNamara.
Waah!
- Where can I get
some more of that shit?
-
Get up and shut up,
Mandrake.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Monk.
- Congratulations, Skulls,
on your rebirth...
a Skull above any other.
- Say it.
-
A Skull above any other.
- Louder.
- A Skull above any other.
or the composition
of its membership.
- You might call it a test.
- The university's
secret societies...
have been playing a little game
for over 200 years.
Mascots. We steal theirs,
they try and steal ours.
Is this so-called python
poisonous?
But remember this:
A snake without scales...
- We have been watching.
- We will be watching.
So, gentlemen,
what are we waiting for?
- It's locked.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
Locks just happen
to be my specialty.
What did you say
your name was?
Luke McNamara.
Caleb Mandrake.
I know. I've been serving
you breakfast for three years.
I'm sorry.
You know, all you guys
in the dining hall look alike.
It must be the little hats.
Yeah, must be the hats.
The skills
of a misspent youth.
I used to be a genuine
menace to society.
There aren't any
snakes in here.
Okay.
"A snake without scales
shows its veins."
They said...
They said that the snake
was  the building,
but that doesn't
necessarily mean that
it was  the building.
Yeah.
Shows its "vanes."
Wow.
Yeah.
You ready?
This must be
what they mean by
"a Skull above any other."
Ready?
Yeah.
Towards you.
One more time.
Hey!
Don't let go, Luke!
Don't let go!
Hold on, Caleb!
Don't let go!
Hold on!
Hold on.
Don't let go.
Pull me up!
Pull me up!
Luke!
Hey, where's Luke?
You  a menace
to society.
"The university's
tenure system only
rewards mediocrity,
"allowing our faculty..."
"to wallow
in selfish pursuits,
"making secondary
their primary purpose:
teaching undergraduates
to think."
Bravo. That's a great
article, Will.
Bob Woodward I'm not,
but give it time,
give it time.
What's happening,
you guys?
What was what like
last night?
We were about to eat
tofu pizza...
when you got a call
and ran out the door
like a bat out of hell,
-
- It was just a really long
night, that's all.
-
- I don't know.
You don't...
You don't know.
and I know this is gonna
sound like a load of crap,
but I don't really want
to talk about it right now.
- I don't mean to be an asshole.
- You said it, I didn't.
- Will...
- No. For three years,
we made fun of these
private school dicks...
that never gave us
the time of day.
And now you're saying
you're gonna hang out
with them?
- Will, this doesn't affect
our relationship at all.
-
How can you say that?
You'll be doing stuff you can
never tell me about, right?
I swear, this doesn't
change anything.
Doesn't change anything?
Oh, great. Cool.
Doesn't change anything.
That's great.
Tell me everything then.
Yeah. Tell me where
you went last night,
what you did.
Why you're wet.
Come on. Tell me.
That's right.
Oh, oh, good.
Walk away.
We're talking ourselves
in circles, Will.
Are you gonna say something?
Are you gonna back me up?
Come on, Chloe. Take a stance
for once. Tell him I'm right.
Tell him I'm right!
-
- Don't tell me how to talk.
Guys, chill out
before you say something
you don't mean.
Okay?
All right. Let me say
something I really mean.
Will...
No, Chloe.
Hey, you and I were
at Maury's, right?
Having a good time,
drinking, talking
to some girls.
And Caleb Mandrake
and your seven new
friends come in.
Introduce me, or is that
against the rules?
How do you know about Caleb?
You see, he's already
on a first-name basis...
No bullshit.
How do you know
about Caleb Mandrake?
Call it a guess.
But Caleb's not
the issue, all right?
The issue's us.
What?
Will!
Hey, Will!
Will, we gotta work
this thing out, okay?
There's gotta be middle ground.
No, see, that's where
you're wrong.
When it comes
to friendship,
there is
no middle ground.
Hello?
This is Caleb Mandrake. May I
speak with Lucas McNamara?
Yes.
Right away... sir.
Will!
Will!
Caleb, can you
hold on one second?
No problem.
Thanks.
Listen, Chloe,
I'm really sorry, but...
I'm sorry.
Caleb,
what's happening, man?
Well, we didn't have
to wait very long.
Why? What's happening?
You know something I don't?
Do me a favor and check
under your pillow.
You might find
a little something
from the tooth fairy.
You too, Mr. Mandrake.
You too.
Who's first?
I guess
they're expecting us.
Kent Hodgins,
over here, please.
I'm Judge Litten Mandrake,
and on behalf of the council,
welcome.
In any fellowship,
you need someone you can trust,
someone to be there
always and for anything.
A soul mate.
And my soul mate
is Senator Ames Levritt,
class of'72.
Gentlemen, you've been
arranged in pairs.
Soul mates.
Each soul mate was chosen
to complement the other...
and to accept responsibility
for the other.
- Thank you.
- Open them.
its hardships...
and sometimes its pain.
Let this seal the bond
between you.
We live by the rules,
we die by the rules.
Read your rule book.
There's a rule for every
possible situation.
supersede those
of the outside world.
"A Skull above any other."
Well done, gentlemen.
Congratulations.
As chairman
of the Order of Skulls...
and on behalf
of the council...
and the 322 alumni
throughout the world,
gentlemen,
you are welcome.
Welcome home.
The proudest day
of my life, Caleb.
Thanks, Dad.
I want to make you proud.
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks.
They're beautiful.
Just like they were
this morning in the ground
outside the dean's office.
I thought
women loved fresh flowers.
I messed up
with you yesterday.
I'm sorry.
Really?
Feels like a bribe.
Oh.
What's all this?
Luke McNamara,
Action Jackson.
Named after Jackson Pollock.
It's my senior thesis.
I am teaching my computer
how to paint.
Really.
No, wait.
Actually, pure randomness
is really what forms...
So am I the artist,
or is the machine?
Are we both?
Maybe it's nobody.
Or maybe it's chaos
in its purest form.
Do you think I can take
you out to dinner now?
Yeah. Know why?
Because Action Jackson
chooses when to begin
and when to end.
I am so getting
an "A."
Since I'm buying tonight,
How hungry would
you say you are?
How hungry would
you say you are?
I'm famished.
Famished?
Mmm-mm.
Well, famished is like,
what, 20 bucks?
Which means that
I'd better get some cash.
It's been a big week
for me. I bought a book.
That's got to be
a mistake.
You  a Skull.
Son of a bitch.
I'm rich!
Luke...
Luke...
Hi.
Yeah?
You're a Skull.
Chloe, I'm not gonna
disappear like that guy.
Just please,
be happy for me.
Fine. I'm happy
if you are.
Good.
When you're happy for me...
Yes!
Gentlemen, if you'll
please follow me.
Mr. Mandrake,
you will be in here.
Mr. Mauberson,
you shall be in here.
And Mr. McNamara,
you will be in here.
The rest of you gentlemen,
please follow me.
Ooh!
Whoo!
Oh, hell, yes.
That's, uh,
McNamara.
Hoo-rah!
Are we having
a bit of tie trouble?
No worries.
I am the king.
It's a bit tricky.
Especially when you're
doing it on someone
other than yourself.
'Cause everything...
is in reverse.
There we go. Nice.
Looks like you've
done this before.
You know,
once or twice.
The skills
of a misspent youth.
Thanks, man.
Come here.
I have this fantastic idea.
Where did you spend
last Thanksgiving?
Last Thanksgiving
I was in a Pizza Hut.
Pizza Hut?
You're gonna spend
Thanksgiving with us.
We have a Mandrake
tradition. We hunt,
but we only eat
what we shoot.
So if we get skunked,
then we spend Thanksgiving
drinking brandy and starving...
in front of
a crackling fire.
Listen, I would love to come.
And actually, where I come from
we have the same tradition.
It's just what we shoot,
we call pigeons.
Hmm.
Ames. Ames,
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr. Lucas McNamara.
Senator. It's a pleasure
to meet you.
Pleasure's mine, Lucas.
We've been waiting
for that law school
application of yours.
I'm on the
admissions committee.
You're right, Litten.
So, Caleb,
what are your plans?
I'm just treading water,
waiting to see what happens.
Then your arms must
be getting tired.
They are, Dad.
'Cause you keep throwing me
into the deep end of the pool.
Excuse me.
I need a drink.
So, what do you think
of all this?
Well, to be honest,
it's all a little bit
overwhelming.
It was for me too.
We share similar
backgrounds, you and I,
and I hope, similar values,
which could put the society's
influence to better use.
Do you have any questions?
Millions.
Like for instance,
who pays for all this?
Rule 46 in your book:
"Each member is required
to leave a percentage of
his estate to the Skulls."
And-And the word "war"
in the ritual room...
what exactly is
the significance?
Those who wish to become
our leaders choose
the ordeal of war...
to prove themselves
worthy of the privilege.
What if we're at peace?
There are always wars
to be fought, Luke.
You ever need anything,
even if it's just to shoot
the proverbial shit,
you call me.
Caleb.
There seems to be a little
tension between your father
and the senator, huh?
Yeah.
They were schoolmates.
Soul mates. And it's gotten
substantially worse...
since my father beat
Levritt out for chairman.
That must be tough, man,
trying to follow
in those footsteps.
Oh, he's
an ambitious man.
The idea of getting to
the Supreme Court's
the only thing he loves.
Speaking of love...
Uh...
Lucas McNamara, right?
Yeah, how did you
know that?
I know everything
about you.
Care to dance?
Hey. What's up, man?
You missed practice.
Yeah, you know,
I've been busy.
Doing what?
It's a secret.
Lookin' good
with that left jab.
Big, tall guy like you.
No. No!
No!
No-o-o!
Lucas. Lucas.
I've been looking all over
for you. I need to talk
to you right now.
Uh, Chloe,
this is Caleb Mandrake.
We've met, at Exeter.
Did we date?
Once or twice.
You obviously found it...
as unforgettable
as I did.
Right. Sure.
Look, uh, Luke,
I feel really ridiculous,
but I left my key
inside of you-know-where.
I don't want to look like
a screw-up so early in the game,
so could I please borrow yours?
Of course. But last
I checked, Caleb,
they didn't kick people out
for being forgetful, huh?
Thanks, Lucas.
is carved the word "war."
The main room is
about 80 feet across,
and it's magnificent,
with nearly ten pillars...
You.
- Caleb Mandrake.
- You broke into my car,
you stole my key,
you stole my book.
Now I want the camera,
I want the tape,
and I want my stuff back now.
Okay.
No problem, man.
Just calm down.
Here's your key.
You can have that,
but, um, I got your book.
I don't have it with me, though,
and we can get that anytime.
Okay? But just calm down.
Will.
Will, man.
Hey, Will.
Will! Will!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
Help me!
I don't understand.
Will would... I mean,
he was the last person...
Sometimes we don't
know people as well
as we think we do.
Look, I have a few
questions. Then...
I think you should
get some sleep.
Did you touch anything
besides the doorknob?
l-I don't know.
I'm in here a lot.
All the time.
Why were you here at 3:00
in the morning? Do you
work for the newspaper?
No, I just wanted
to talk to him.
What would you have
to talk to him about
at 3:00 in the morning?
We had had an argument.
It was no big deal.
So you had a fight.
What was this fight about?
Don't put words in my mouth.
I told you we had an argument.
We were roommates.
That's all there was to it.
Calm down. It seems
like you're getting
a little excited here.
What are you
trying to say?
- What are you trying to say?
- Easy, son.
I'm just saying plain
and simple, what was
the argument about?
Detective Sparrow,
Martin Lombard.
I'm the university provost.
Do we have to
do this now?
Can we give him
a break?
I have a few more questions,
but maybe this isn't
the right time.
I'll be in touch.
You can go, Mr. McNamara.
Get some sleep.
Oh, my God.
Lucas.
I just heard. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
What am I gonna
tell his mother?
This should go too.
Hey, uh, you want
I should pack these too?
I have something to tell you.
Will was doing
an expose on the Skulls.
He had a lot of interest
from a lot of papers.
Even job offers.
I know.
I found his notes.
Why couldn't you have
told me about this sooner?
Will made me
promise not to.
I think the police should
know... they've been around
asking questions.
You can't talk to them.
Did this story have something
to do with Will's death?
Did it?
I don't know, Chloe.
I don't know.
I guess if
we were the friends
we thought we were,
maybe...
maybe things might have
turned out differently.
I lied.
Will lied.
And now you're lying.
You're lying to me.
Move. Move!
Your girlfriend told us
what your fight
with Will was about.
She's not my girlfriend.
Okay, then, your friend
who's a girl.
We also found something
quite interesting.
What's that?
Will Beckford had a contusion
on the back of his head.
Normally when people hang
themselves, they don't
have a contusion...
like they hit themselves
in the back of the head
with a sledge hammer.
Clearly, something violent
happened to Will Beckford
before his suicide...
or what was made
to look like a suicide.
Don't let it keep you
up nights, McNamara,
because we're doing our work,
and I know how deeply
concerned you are.
I'll get back to you.
Unless you want to get
back to me first.
He has what they call
a puncher's chance.
Gentlemen.
Tonight begins
the revealing process...
the final stage
of your admission
into the order.
Come with us
into liars' hell.
Gentlemen,
do come in.
The revealing process
is our most sacred ritual.
It's been a Skull tradition
since the late 1700s...
and it is the foundation
of your class's commitment...
to each other.
Each soul mate pair
will be placed
within the device.
And then you may ask them
any question you want...
about anything that you want.
The object is to learn
all that you can
about each other.
release them.
Which pair wants
to go first?
Caleb and I will.
My worst fear?
My worst fear is that
I'll always be alone.
My mother was killed
in a car crash...
when I was so young
that I can't even
remember her face.
My whole life,
I never had any family,
up until a couple years ago,
when I met
a friend who became
like a brother to me.
And then last week, he was taken
from me too. Why do you think
this keeps happening, Caleb?
Huh? Any ideas?
I don't know, Luke.
Who can answer that?
You can. You can tell me
the worst thing
you've ever done.
I had an affair
with my mother's best friend.
Why are you so afraid
of your father?
My father always
covers for me,
always gets me
out of trouble.
I never take responsibility
for anything.
Fine. Then take
responsibility for this.
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?
- God, where do I start...
- Don't play games
with me, Caleb!
What's the worst thing
you've ever done? The worst?
- What are you talking about?
- I know what you did.
What are you
talking about?
Know where
I found this? Hmm?
Thank you.
I lost this,
and I wondered
where it went.
Gentlemen.
Congratulations.
McNamara, Mandrake,
the chairman would like
to see you.
I'll be waiting
upstairs.
- Would you excuse us, Marty?
- Certainly.
Well done, Luke.
Well done.
Don't give me your "well dones."
I wanna know the truth...
about what happened
to Will Beckford that night.
The truth.
Your roommate stole
both my book and my key.
Then I went to the ritual room,
and he was photographing
everything.
I tried to stop him.
- I want your camera, the tape,
and my stuff back now.
- Okay, here's your key.
You can have that.
I got your book.
I don't have it with me.
- We can get that any time.
- No, I'll tell you what.
You give me the key.
- I'll give you the key.
- We'll get the book together.
You won't say anything.
- All right. Calm down.
- I won't say anything.
- Nothing'll happen to you,
and everything'll be fine.
- How about...
if I tell you
I can't do that, all right?
Get off me!
No!
and he broke his neck.
Man, there was nothing
I could do.
Caleb... Nothing...
Will is dead!
We didn't go to the authorities
because we knew where
that would've gotten us.
our obligation to the Skulls to
keep our oaths would've been
ruined because of an accident.
So, we took this accident
and made it look like a suicide.
Let's not forget...
Will Beckford illegally
broke into a car.
He's a thief,
and he trespassed
where he didn't belong.
This isn't right.
This is your preacceptance
to the law school
of your choice.
I haven't even applied
to law school yet.
Imagine that.
It's all paid for.
Won't you do the same
for me?
Miss, would you bring me
another cup of coffee
and some  milk, please?
Sorry about that.
Excuse me.
You took quite a risk
by calling me.
You said to call any time
I wanted to shoot the shit.
Remember, Senator?
Do you know?
I'm on the council, son.
Even Litten Mandrake
couldn't pull off a cover-up
like this by himself.
Here you go.
Thank you.
How are you managing
with your decision
to remain silent?
How are you managing
with yours?
Our society's
a compulsive lot, Lucas.
The Skulls are a group
that cannot help
but dot every "I,"
cross every "T,"
keep a record of every deed,
every whispered confession.
The surveillance cameras.
So there's gotta be tapes.
Our organization
is putting all its resources...
into Judge Mandrake's
confirmation to
the federal bench...
as a precursor
to the Supreme Court.
One would hate for
an awful secret to arise,
which would derail
such an important agenda.
That... awful secret...
would be a valuable
piece of information indeed.
Perhaps a bargaining chip
with the council,
used possibly
to reacquire one's freedom?
To get one's
life back again?
His birthday
was last week.
I know.
It's a peace offering.
- Turn yours down, man!
-
Hey, boys.
I need to talk to you.
Sully, I'm sorry I missed
your birthday.
If you want to confess,
St. Something-Or-Other
is down the street.
- So why don't you
roll yourself into there.
- I'm not kidding.
I'm in real trouble here, okay?
If you don't help me,
Sully's birthday is not
gonna be the last one I miss,
including my own, understand?
- Why should we help you?
Huh, Lukie?
- I don't know.
Maybe you feel like turning
the other cheek. Or perhaps
you wanna be forgiving.
Or just maybe you wanna try
and be a better friend to me
than I've been to you.
Come over here
for a second.
More than likely,
you wanna take a look
out of this window,
'cause you'll probably see
a '63 T-Bird convertible.
Dual exhausts, four-barrel carb
and fully restored original
red leather interior.
And it belongs to me.
You help me out,
it belongs to you.
You wanna know what's up?
Big Boy changes the tapes twice
a day... 10:00 A.M., 10:00 P.M.
Okay, got him.
He's heading east.
I'm on it.
Aah!
- Are you having a problem?
- Um, yes, sir.
Actually,
it's a family emergency.
Excuse me.
Don't lose him.
We gotta find out
where he takes those tapes.
Hey. Wait.
Don't... Hey. Hey.
Nobody's allowed into
the Sturtevant Collection
without a pass. Let's go.
Come on.
You know what this is?
It's a bug.
It's a bug! Understand?
I want you to listen to me.
I want you to stop following
Lombard's people.
Hell, they know
everything we do!
They know every place we go!
Oh, and your friend upstairs?
Her place is bugged too,
so she's not safe either.
I didn't... mean
to hurt your friend, Luke.
I swear to God,
I never meant
to hurt your friend.
Please. Please don't
give 'em a reason.
That's all they need.
I'm late for class.
Please!
So talk.
Chloe, please!
l...
What?
I have a friend,
and he's made some decisions,
but it turns out
that they were all wrong.
Why? Why were
they wrong?
Because he was selfish,
and because he was greedy,
and he thought they
would give him everything
that he ever wanted.
But all they ended up
giving him was disaster.
So, now, this friend of mine,
he can go out on a limb,
and that limb could get cut off.
But everything about
being on that limb is right.
So what do I do?
We should sit down, and you
should treat me like a friend
and tell me the truth.
Okay.
Our membership
will never allow such a corrupt
and unfair motion to pass.
- The membership will
have to understand that we...
- They must never know.
According to Rule 88,
if this council wishes
to make a decision...
which will be kept secret
from our membership,
it will require
a unanimous vote.
Then I move, under Rule 88,
that Mr. Lucas McNamara
undergo psychiatric evaluation
at our hospital,
and I hereby call for a vote.
The motion is defeated.
Ames, could I see you
upstairs for a moment?
We used to believe
in the same things.
- What happened?
- I've learned there are limits.
Really?
She likes to eat popsicles
after you make love.
but, uh, my God, Ames,
she's only 19.
would be as forgiving
as I am.
Shall we vote again?
McNamara!
This is how you break up
with me? With this
pathetic letter?
What... Oh, let me see.
"Can we still be friends?"
I wrote the letter. I don't
need it read back to me.
I know you wrote the letter!
No, we can't be friends.
You just remember
three things, pal:
You don't talk to me,
you don't call me,
and don't
send me one of these
chickenshit letters
ever again!
Piece of shit!
Smart play, Lucas.
Smart play.
Okay, they can't
hear us now.
Did they buy it?
I'm pretty sure.
You were very convincing.
Did you get everything
I need?
Yeah, it's in there.
I don't understand something.
If they're so smart,
they'd destroy those
surveillance tapes.
You don't know these people.
This is how they work.
They use each other's
nasty little secrets
against themselves.
Wait. If you changed your mind,
if you decided to run,
I could help you. M-My family...
M-My family
could help you.
I can't live like that.
I need you
to promise me something.
What?
No matter what happens,
you don't get involved.
No, I can't do that.
- Please.
- No, you got me involved.
I'm involved.
- I can't move forward
if I think you're in danger.
- I'm gonna be there for you.
- Do you understand what
these people are capable of?
- I do understand.
-
- I'm in love with you.
I am.
I love you.
Ow!
Aah!
Okay. You got me.
Whoa, whoa. Hey.
Shut up!
- Give me the tape.
- I got your tape.
It's right here.
-
- Come on. It's right here.
-
-
Come on! Come on!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go! Go!
Go, go, go!
Nice plan, Lukie.
Okay, here we go.
You stole my key!
You stole my book!
I want your camera,
Here's the key.
We'll get the book later.
No, you give me the key,
we'll go get the book.
Get off me!
-
- Oh, my God.
-
Oh, God! No!
No! Oh, God!
Dad! You have to
listen to me!
Dad, I just killed a guy
in the ritual room!
Dad, I should call the police!
I can't just leave him here!
Yes, I understand!
Luke. Oh, my God.
Wait. He's moving.
- He's mov... Look, he's moving.
- Jesus, he's still alive.
Did you see his arm?
Yeah. Fast-forward
the tape.
Help me.
Luke, who are they?
Who are they?
That's Martin Lombard,
He's pretty far gone, sir.
- Who is he talking to?
- It could only be Mandrake.
Can you get any closer on this?
- Yeah.
-
Closer.
- Closer.
-
Oh, my God.
They killed him.
What are you gonna do?
Luke, we were just
talking about you.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry, Luke, but I
couldn't live with myself.
- I had to tell them
what you did.
- What  did?
and how you covered it up
to make it look like a suicide.
- He's lying to you, Detective.
- I'm not lying. I have
nothing to lie about.
I have evidence, okay?
Everything you wanted to know...
the truth... it's on the tape.
Mr. Mandrake,
we have your statement.
We'll talk to you later.
Keep Mr. McNamara company.
Get something to play
this tape on,
and call the D.A.'s office.
I want somebody
down here now.
I haven't seen so much snow
since my last ski trip.
I'm telling you,
this is the tape.
It's on here.
It's a split-screen thing.
There's four different
cameras running.
It's gotta be forward.
I don't... It was...
Wh...
Oh, great.
You... You switched
the goddamn tape!
Why'd you do it?
What do they have on you?
Why are you working for them?
- "Them"? Who?
- The Skulls! The Skulls!
The Skulls, man!
Who do you think is pulling
the strings around here?
They're watching you.
They're watching me.
They control everything!
They control everything we do,
including him! Even him!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You've gotta listen.
Listen!
Martin Lombard
killed my roommate.
- Martin Lombard,
the university's provost?
-
Yes, he snapped
Will Beckford's neck,
for Christ's sakes!
He snapped
Will Beckford's neck!
- The suicide thing
was just a cover-up.
-
- Yes, and he's in on it!
- Why did Martin Lombard
kill your roommate?
Because Litten Mandrake
told him to.
Oh. Judge Litten Mandrake?
Judge Litten Mandrake.
He runs the whole show.
That's ridiculous.
- It's the truth!
You're working for him!
- It's ridiculous!
Listen, please.
You gotta believe me.
Listen,
he's in on it, okay?
I'm innocent here.
I'm telling you the truth!
Hey!
I'm telling you the truth.
I'm telling you the tr...
You son of a bitch!
How could you
do this to me?
-  Get off me!
-
What do they got on you?
Huh? Huh? Aah!
-
- Get him out of here!
What do they got on you?
How'd they get to you?
Listen to me!
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
What are you doing here?
I saw the tape, Caleb.
What tape?
What are you talking about?
Luke is in a mental hospital.
They may never let him out.
Just tell the police
the truth. Please.
I think you better go.
Hey, Caleb, before I go,
one last thing.
The most interesting thing
on that tape was when
you left the building.
Will Beckford,
he wasn't dead.
Ow! Ow! Oww!
Hey! What happened?
-
-
Where is she?
-
-
Get in, Chloe.
I'll take you to Luke.
I will. I'll take you to Luke.
Come on. Let's go.
There he is, Senator,
in the solarium.
Luke.
Luke!
Luke. Luke.
Luke, it's me.
It's me.
Help me now!
Just...
It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I'm gonna get you...
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
I've arranged
this car for you.
Wait. Wait.
Where do we go?
What do we do?
Now, you must remind him
that there is only
one solution to all this.
"We live by the rules.
We die by the rules."
l-l... Please, I don't
know what you mean.
He'll know.
Now go.
I'm leaving the hospital.
They're all yours.
You're gonna be okay, okay?
Let's fix you.
You're gonna be okay,
'cause you're out of there.
You're not going back.
Oh! Luke. Luke.
Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, Luke.
Son of a bitch!
Whoo!
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Hang on. Luke, hang on.
Come on.
Get off of him!
Oh!
-
-
-
-
No!
-
- I don't understand.
The senator has great faith
that if you think it through,
you'll figure it out.
The sen... You work
for Senator Levritt?
Just get in the jeep
and get out of here.
Did you see
what was on that tape?
Don't ask me questions.
I've given you answers.
Now go.
Thanks.
We've got to figure out
what to do next,
because they're gonna find us.
Okay.
Sparrow was working
for Levritt,
but he was the one
that switched the tape,
and he didn't help me
when I needed it.
He waited until
I got out of Sanctuary.
All of which means what?
What is Levritt
trying to tell us?
"We live by the rules.
We die by the rules"?
What?
Levritt.
He told me to remind you
that we live by the rules,
we die by the rules.
Yes.
Rule 119, right in
the middle of the page.
"A challenge may be presented
and gentlemanly
means pursued"?
"Gentlemanly means."
I don't get it.
I do.
Levritt wanted to make sure
that I had only one option
available to me.
Gentlemanly means.
What day is it today?
Uh, it's Friday.
The Skulls are gonna be
out on the island tomorrow.
Baby, come on.
Lie down.
Come on.
Come on.
So tomorrow I bring war
to the Skulls.
to celebrate the end
of the Revealing Process.
And now that you have shared
all with each other,
we would like to show you
exactly how much
you are appreciated.
- Above any other.
- Above any other.
You know you're not supposed
to be here, especially
the way you're dressed.
Oh, Mr. McNamara.
Come to collect your check.
Under the auspices of Rule 119,
I hereby petition for justice...
for the satisfaction
of differences between myself
and Mr. Caleb Mandrake...
in the matter of the death
of Will Beckford.
-
- What's Rule 119?
between members
of such serious nature...
that avail themselves
of no other solution..."
"A challenge may be presented
and gentlemanly means pursued."
- And what does that mean?
- He's challenging you
to a duel, Caleb.
A duel?
He must be kidding.
No, sir. I'm not.
Dr. Whitney?
The man's a fugitive.
He should be arrested.
Call the authorities.
Our rules supersede theirs.
You of all people know that.
Then I demand the right
to take the place of my son
in this duel.
You can't, Chairman.
"To avoid conflicts of interest,
all council members
are excluded...
from precedings pertaining
to their kin's fate."
It's Rule 119-B,
line 15.
There are two ways
out of this, Lucas.
One is you can withdraw
your challenge.
And the other?
Your dead.
Caleb's a crack shot.
You've got no chance.
I guess I won't be coming over
for Thanksgiving, then.
Dad, I have to ask you
this one thing.
Was Will Beckford
still alive when
I left the ritual room?
Son, I love you,
and I've never lied to you.
The answer is no.
Gentlemen,
it's time to begin.
Mr. Mandrake,
you have been challenged,
therefore the choice
of weapons is yours.
Tell them the truth
about what happened to Will.
I'm sorry, Luke.
Don't apologize to me.
Just tell them the truth.
No, I'm sorry for what
I have to do to you.
Ten paces.
On my signal.
One, two,
- What you did to Will Beckford
was an accident.
-
-
-
-
- Are you ready to murder
your friend?
Just tell them the truth
and this ends right now.
Tell them the truth!
- Just tell them
the truth, please.
- Fire, Caleb!
Dad!
- Fire, damn it!
-
Just tell them the truth,
and we'll get through this
together. I swear.
-
- Aah!
Get my bag! Get my bag!
Caleb!
-
- Gauze! We need gauze!
You weren't worth the effort.
Litten.
It's over, Caleb.
It's over.
You told me that there
are always wars to be fought.
This was your war.
Yes.
And the good guys won.
Nobody won.
Not true.
Mandrake's finished.
He'll never be confirmed
to the federal court.
I'll become Skull chairman.
You'll be exonerated...
and help me lead
the new generation
of Skulls into the future.
Someone I loved once told me
that if it's secret and elite,
it can't be good.
He was right.
You used me.
I helped you. Taught you
how to make the world
work for you, for us.
Do you truly believe you
can walk away from this?
All we've given you?
And someday, when I
call on you for a favor,
will you be able
to deny me?
And if you deny me, will it
jeopardize the life you've built
for your wife and your family?
I don't know if you can
live with those doubts, Lucas.
Watch me.
Well done, son.
Well done.
