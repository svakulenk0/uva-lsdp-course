WOMAN:
RUDY:  The idea behind the DRNs
was to be as human as possible.
JOHN:
- I'll lead you in?
- Let's go.
WOMAN:
They sleep
And sleepwalk
They dissolve to dreams
Hear children crying
They're losing everything...
MALE VOICE:
Welcome to the 17th hole.
Brian Barrow on the tee.
And straight up the middle...
For all we know
There's nothing changed...
COMPUTER VOICE:
Media off.
Are you going to answer that?
No.
DORIAN:
It's Samantha.
Yep.
Hey, no, Dorian...
Uh, John Kennex's line.
Uh, he does not
wish to speak
with you right now.
He is waving his hands,
gesturing "no."
Yes, I understand.
I hate it
when he does that, too.
Yeah, I know.
That's the least
of his problems.
Okay.
You take care.
Would you like me
to relay her message?
No, I think I got it.
Thanks.
Do you want to talk about it?
Samantha and I
had dinner last night...
and the hologram
of her roommate and her mom
and her therapist.
Every single call
she got, she took.
She holo-blocked you.
Exactly. I mean,
whatever happened
to two people just sharing
a meal and connecting, you know?
- I know.
- You wouldn't know.
Why am I asking you?
You wouldn't have a clue.
Well... and I'm
just positing this...
perhaps you're boring.
Boring?
You're calling me boring?
We need to talk about guy code.
There's certain things
you don't do...
Hey, I need you to help me
check out a possible homicide.
Sure. When did the call come in?
It didn't.
There's no sign of forced entry,
no struggle.
No foul play indicated at all.
EMTs are calling it
cardiac arrest.
I don't understand.
Why is it considered
a possible homicide?
The victim's a chrome.
We're genetically engineered.
We don't die young.
The deceased's name
is Brian Barrow, 28.
Bond trader
at Kane Asset Management.
JOHN: Explains the view.
Anything missing?
According to the report, no.
Rules out robbery as a likely motive.
Medical history?
Typical chrome.
No health issues.
World-class athlete,
a swimmer.
He competed in the
Detroit Olympics of 2036.
There's no logical explanation
for this.
How could he die like this?
We should do a toxicology.
Maybe EMTs got it right:
heart attack.
No. When a chrome is designed,
every box is checked:
health, beauty, intelligence.
Look, I know chromes
aren't supposed to have
congenital defects;
perfect genes and all that.
Chromes don't normally
become cops, either.
There's a first time
for everything.
DORIAN:
Look at this.
There's a half-millimeter
puncture wound
at the base of his skull.
It goes all the way
to his cerebral cortex.
JOHN:
Can you get any DNA?
Something wrong?
If this is the entry point
to something that killed him,
the DNA indicates
that Brian Barrow was murdered
by seven different people.
JOHN: Alec Govain,
Philip Moses makes seven.
And these are the seven people
whose DNA we found in the wound?
Of the murder victim?
DORIAN: Whatever weapon was used
to kill Brian Barrow
was contaminated by the DNA
of all these people.
MALDONADO:
Did you locate them?
JOHN:
They're all dead.
DORIAN:
They're all listed as dying
of natural causes.
Their hearts stopped.
What do you think's
going on, John?
I don't know, but I doubt
they died of natural causes.
MALDONADO:
Are these people chromes?
They are not, but they must
have been chosen for a reason.
Do you think we stumbled
upon a serial killer?
JOHN: Yeah. If he hadn't
killed the chrome,
we never would have
picked this up.
It would be pretty easy to miss
a little pinprick
on the back of the neck.
What do they have in common?
They all lived in city limits.
Other than that, our algorithms
didn't pick up any patterns.
I see one pattern.
They're all very attractive.
Do it again.
We have to stop.
You will do what I want,
or I will call
the police,
and you will go to jail
for the rest of your life
for practicing
with a revoked license.
Your choice.
Someone's been talking
to the press
about the chrome murder.
You're kidding. Already?
"Metro Police hunt for
possible serial killer
targeting the city's
young and beautiful."
My comm's been
ringing off the hook.
We don't even know
anything yet,
and they're already
talking about it.
VALERIE: This kind of news sells.
Chromes have ears
all over the city,
and they take care of their own.
Now, I have a lead.
Two hours before
the victim was killed,
he was at the Electus Club
on Remington.
Killer could have followed him
from the club.
I'll check it out.
Actually, I should go.
Alone.
The Electus is a chrome club.
Of course. Makes sense.
We'll go check in with Rudy.
The bodies of the other victims
are on the way to him.
If they have the same wounds
on the back of their neck,
maybe he can find out
what killed them.
You sure you're up for
going to the chrome club?
Yeah. They may not respect
what I've done with my life,
but they sure respect
what I can do for theirs.
You were the first one they
called when Brian Barrow died.
Only because they're
praying it was murder.
If Brian Barrow died
of natural causes,
the chromes would have
to face something
they never thought possible.
The whole selling point of being
a chrome is a long life.
And perfect health.
People pay a lot of money
for perfection.
Let me know
if you need anything.
Robert, Violet, welcome.
Nice to see you.
I'm sorry.
This is a private club.
I'm sorry, too,
that I'm a member.
Detective Valerie Stahl.
I need to see your surveillance
data from yesterday.
You're a police officer?
You're a chrome.
Yeah, I just
showed you my badge,
and I know you have
I can't help you.
I'm investigating the murder
of a chrome named Brian Barrow.
I'm sure you heard about it
on the news.
As general manager,
I'm responsible for protecting
the privacy of our members.
Maybe I'm not making
myself clear.
We believe his killer may have
followed him from here.
In that case, he would show up
on the police drones,
wouldn't he?
Again, this is a private...
Club. Yes, I know, and I'm sure
you're smart enough to know
that I can get a search warrant
in about 45 seconds.
And you must be
smart enough to know
that I can get
Chief Judge Thorne
to quash it
ten seconds after that.
- He's a member.
- I guess I'll just be forced
to cut your police patrol
by 50%.
- Is that supposed to scare me?
- Should.
Based on statistical models,
it'll trigger
a 32% rise in violent attacks
in the area.
Criminals find out we're not
patrolling like we used to,
and they're gonna
take advantage.
Before you know it,
this is a high-incident area.
You know how that works.
We don't need the police.
We have private security.
You mean the guy in the hallway
violating the concealed
weapons statute 49B?
That's a lot to sweep under
the rug, even for Judge Thorne.
- Sorry. Is there a problem?
- Yeah.
Do you have anyone
a little more formidable?
Oh, not me.
I bruise easily.
Chromes don't bruise easily.
Ah, you are
a good police officer.
I'm the owner.
You want to sit?
I'd love to.
Jake Bellman.
DORIAN:
that leaked our investigation
to the press?
It's possible.
They got a lot of
pull in this town.
Do you know
how many murders there are
in this city every year?
- 756.
- Yeah, a lot.
One of them turns out to
be a chrome, and suddenly
the whole world stops.
Just proves my point.
What point?
That technology, in this case
chromes,
is driving a wedge
between people.
Making it us versus them.
Technology, like being
holo-blocked on a date.
I thought we agreed
that you had a bad date
because you're boring.
You just can't handle the fact
that technology's
part of the problem.
Cuts a little close
to the titanium.
No, in fact, I'm excited
to embrace this new,
- anti-tech lifestyle.
- Really?
On the way back
to the precinct,
let's replace your robotic leg
with a tree limb.
Or maybe something useful,
like a shovel.
I wish I had a shovel.
JAKE BELLMAN:
so I know that detectives
can't cut police patrols.
I'm gonna get that footage
one way or the other.
A chrome was killed.
A member of your club.
One of your own.
We want to know
what the story is.
Okay, well, I want to know
what your story is.
Why, 'cause I'm
a police officer?
I'm a curiosity to you?
No, but I am curious.
It's a long story.
Well, I've got time.
Yeah? You don't need
to get back to your club?
No.
Being a cop, it's
not the strangest
life choice I've
heard for a chrome.
You know,
my brother's a sculptor.
You want to know
what his medium is?
Sure.
You ever heard of a chain saw?
Yes.
Chain saw and lumber.
That's his medium.
Not too many galleries
for something like that.
I think they kind of
overdid his creative gene.
I can imagine you'd know
how my parents felt
having a chrome who didn't
meet their expectations.
You pity him?
No. He pities us.
He's proud to call himself
a sculptor.
He's happy.
What about you?
You proud to call yourself
a police officer?
Yes.
Even in front of other chromes?
I told you it's a long story.
Are you happy?
Yeah, I am.
Every time I get a bad guy.
Then let's get you
that surveillance video.
FEMALE REPORTER:
police officials
refuse to confirm
an investigation into
the so-called beauty killer.
But sources close to the probe
say the hunt
for a possible serial murderer
is underway and intensifying.
This is Claire Chang re...
- Rudy.
- Oh!
You're here.
Finally.
Mausoleum dropped off three
of the exhumed bodies
an hour ago.
And...
you were right.
Vir-topsy reveals
that all seven of them
have the same wound, uh,
at the base of the neck.
They were indeed murdered.
Have a look.
JOHN:
Any idea what caused it?
I might, yeah.
Something wrong?
You've got this "beauty killer"
out there,
and I have to hear
about it on the news.
You don't think to warn me?
What's the difference
between me and all seven
of these victims?
Hmm? I'll tell you.
They're all dead.
You're worried
that you're gonna be targeted?
I was a child model.
I-I have
a Rothschild's nose.
My grandmother's
a sixth cousin of the heir.
It was an oversight, Rudy.
Uh, we're sorry.
Duly noted.
So what did you find?
Something in the wound.
First centimeter,
a very clean insertion point,
consistent with a needle.
After that, it gets weird.
It's irregular.
JOHN:
Looks like tiny
claw marks.
They are.
From nanobots.
Nanobots?
Are you saying
robots were injected
into their necks,
crawled inside their skulls
and killed them?
Yeah, same as Brian Barrow.
In fact, they found
two of these things
still inside him.
I call them Mike and Ike.
Any idea what Mike and Ike
are designed to do?
I'm working on it.
Great work at the Electus Club.
I'm amazed they gave up
the tape without a fight.
Thanks.
What's on your mind?
I'm thinking
maybe it wasn't so bad
being around chromes after all.
The last time
you dealt with chromes,
you were at the shooting range
for three hours.
Poor targets didn't know
what hit them.
Yeah, well...
I guess we can all be surprised.
I spent so much time resenting
where I came from
that I forgot
they're people, too.
You know, sometimes it's nice
to connect with people
who are like you,
who understand you.
Is that why you keep
Kennex around?
No.
I lost a bet.
MAN:
Captain.
Looks like facial rec
has a match.
Stahl.
Hey. I got the footage
from the Electus Club.
I'm sending you a file.
What do you got?
I have Brian Barrow
leaving the club at 5:30.
Keep watching... There!
You see that?
The guy in the coat?
Yup. I think that's our guy.
He follows Barrow
down Remington.
Comes around Sixth Avenue.
And then I get
a facial recognition
from the Bitcoin exchange
across the street.
Comes up as Alec Govain.
That's one of the dead victims.
Correct.
It's not over.
He comes around the next corner.
Now a camera from the cab stand
picks him up.
This time, facial rec reads him
as Todd Paxton.
JOHN:
Another victim.
How could one man
come up on facial rec
as two different people?
I think I have an answer.
There you are.
Thank you.
Can... can I help you?
One large nitro.
Coming right up.
RUDY:
are programmed to do,
they read and reconstruct
facial tissue.
What did he say?
He said our killer is stealing
Did anyone ever tell you
you have very pretty eyes?
RUDY: This is about
nanobot plastic surgery.
Dr. Randolph Amir.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Stop! You're
not allowed to be in...
Dr. Randolph Amir?
- Yes. - We understand
that you're involved
in the research
into nanobot
facial reconstruction.
Yeah, I'm gonna call you back.
The idea was a new technology.
Nanobot facelifts
on an atomic level.
No more laser nips and tucks.
Microscopic robots programmed
to rebuild the face
from the inside.
Not a single scar.
At least not on the outside.
- And?
- And...
it did not go well.
I wasn't involved in the trials.
But I have to admit I was
one of the first people
to really believe in it.
We still don't know why.
Why what?
It was stopping people's hearts.
On the victim, we found a mark
right at the...
At the base of the skull.
Yeah, the device
that inserts the nanobots
into the neck
is called an actuator.
Uh, let's say
you wanted his perfect nose.
The actuator injects
the nanobots
into the target area.
They're programmed to collect
his genetic blueprint.
Then the actuator
would draw them out again,
and then they'd be
injected into you.
The patient.
Rebuilding your nose
to look exactly like his.
All done from the inside.
The problem was
the electricity caused
by the nanobots
somehow triggered an arrhythmia
in the donor's heart
until it stopped.
The donors were dying.
Some of the recipients
in the study
were substantially disfigured.
Where would someone
find an actuator
to do this procedure?
The nanobots followed
their blueprint perfectly.
You're one step closer
to your ideal face.
Let's keep going.
Now.
When will it ever
be enough, Eric?
You know I know
all about the risks.
You know I don't care.
What you did to me
was worse than dying.
You volunteered for the trials.
Do it.
I don't like what that stuff
does to me.
You know I have to flood
your system with adrenaline,
boost your physical strength,
or you will never survive
another procedure so soon.
They're beautiful.
You know, it's okay
to have flaws, John.
Whatever helps you sleep.
It is said that
the more flaws you have,
the more human you are.
Have I told you how very human
you are lately?
You know, sometimes
when you're doing this,
I'm not really listening.
I don't have that many flaws.
Your left eye
is one half millimeter
higher than the right.
Your nose has an abnormality
one inch from the base.
Yeah, that's from being
punched in the face.
Adds character.
You have a fertile unibrow
that you tend to regularly.
At least it's my face.
I know where I came from.
You're a composite; who
knows where you came from?
Just think about that.
Kennex.
VALERIE:
Hey, John, where are you?
I'm on my way to Chinatown.
Near the Wall.
We've got another victim.
What have you got?
I have an informant
who knows everything
about the black market.
We're trying to find
an actuator.
What's an actuator?
It's what our guy is using
to kill these people.
I want to see
if I can track one,
find out where he got it.
The latest victim has
the same M.O.
Heart stops, small wound
at the back of the neck.
John, the last seven murders
were each a month apart,
and the last two victims
were within 48 hours.
This guy's accelerating.
We need to stop him.
DORIAN:
You chew with your mouth open,
you lie about putting gel
in your hair,
and you snore.
JOHN:
How do you know I snore?
Your smartbed told me.
Oh, I didn't realize you
two had a relationship.
What else did it tell you?
I don't know.
Whatever it was,
I purged it from my data.
Apparently,
I didn't want to remember.
Good.
So what does this informant
look like?
I'll know him when I see him.
I hate to see robots used
for entertainment like this.
You know a guy called Dicarlo?
No.
DORIAN:
What are you doing, man?
Hey, Dicarlo.
Damn it, Kennex!
I thought you were dead.
Glad to see me?
Do you have any idea
how expensive these things are?
Huh?!
Dorian, Dicarlo.
Dicarlo, Dorian.
That was my favorite exosuit.
Super comfy on the inside
and sweet like pie
on the outside.
Look, I need your help.
I want to find something
called an actuator.
That's what it looks like.
Look at it.
- I am looking.
- Look at it like you mean it.
It's used in
illegal high-end
plastic surgery.
Plastic surgery?
Yeah, the kind that kills
the person whose face you want.
You know where I can
find something like that?
What do I get out of it?
Look, you either help us out
of the goodness of your heart,
or I'll get my robot to
toss you and your suit
over the Wall.
Okay, look,
there's a guy,
and if there's heat on you,
he can change your face
so facial rec
won't recognize you.
Is this guy a doctor?
I don't know. Probably.
Where do we find him?
In the East Term.
JOHN:
Police. Open up.
- Police. Open up.
- No, no, no.
A little help here?!
He's gone into cardiac arrest.
DORIAN:
He's dead.
Looks like he took a shot
of synthetic adrenaline.
He was freakishly strong.
Thought he was gonna
fight his way out.
Whatever this guy was into,
he didn't want to get caught.
You think?
His name is Dr. Curtis McCann.
Was.
He was one of the 20 doctors
involved in the nanobot trials.
He lost his medical license
for hiding the side effects.
Dorian, here's the guy
we're looking for.
This face is a composite
of the specific features
of the victims.
There are ten parts
to this facial construction.
These are the
facial features he wants.
There have only been
nine victims so far.
Means there's still
one out there.
Can you extrapolate
who the next victim's gonna be?
According to facial rec,
this looks like the next victim.
Looks like he selected
the cheekbone structure.
Stahl, we think we know
who the next victim's
going to be.
Freeze!
This is the police.
Sweep the perimeter.
Jonathan Geddes?
What the hell is this?
We're here to protect you.
What have you got?
Nothing yet.
We've got a plainclothes
downstairs,
Any more info
on the killer's I.D.?
We subpoenaed the insurance
company to get the names
of the patients in the trials.
Might take a few days
to get through the red tape.
VALERIE:
JOHN:
Hold on a minute.
Who is it?
The call is scrambled.
Answer it.
And say what?
I don't know.
Just-just use his voice,
you know,
like you... like you do mine.
I have never heard his voice.
I've only heard him grunt
when he was kicking your ass.
Terrific.
JOHN:
Hey, I'm back. Sorry.
He's not gonna give up
when he's just one piece away.
JOHN:  He's been selecting
his victims carefully.
Oh...
Now, I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her
Crimson and clover
I...
Wish she'd come walking over
Now, I've been waiting
to show her
Crimson and clover
Over and over
Over and over...
How is he choosing his
victims?
He has the perfect
face in mind,
and he's found the victims
with those features.
VALERIE: They have one
other thing in common.
They all live in
the Lower Term.
Well, that narrows it down
to half a million... people.
MALDONADO:
What is it?
Take a look at my driver's
license. What do you see?
A terrible picture.
You should have it redone.
Yeah, I tried, but you have
to wait in line for hours
to get the new 3-D pictures,
which all of these people have.
Maybe where they lived
is the pattern after all.
Overlay the DMV district.
DORIAN: They all fall
in the same district.
Do you think the guy
works at the DMV?
VALERIE: That's the only
connection we have.
Let's check it out.
__

__
__

__
__
Guys.
I got something.
What'd you find?
I think I found him.
He did work at the DMV.
His name is Eric Latham.
JOHN:
Can we be sure it's him?
He went on disability
September 9, a year ago.
That's when the trials
were beginning.
Do you think he still
has access to the DMV files?
He could. Technically,
he's still an employee.
He's had 32 surgeries
in the last seven years.
MALDONADO: Why would he
volunteer for these trials?
He looks perfectly normal.
And there's nothing
in his medical history
that shows he was
disfigured, either.
to mitigate the disaster
he sees in the mirror.
That's not a disaster.
VALERIE:
Go get him.
Good job.
OFFICER:
Bedroom's clear!
Bathroom's clear.
Clear!
He's gone.
OFFICER: Code four...
area is secure.
His terminal's encrypted.
JOHN:
What do you got?
DORIAN: He's using a
composite picture
of his ideal face
as his avatar.
His only correspondence
was with one woman.
Online.
They chatted every day.
JOHN:
Who is she?
DORIAN:
Her screen name is Judy.
They communicated this morning.
They've been corresponding
for months.
He told her he lives in Arizona.
They've never met,
but he's using his real name.
I don't think she's a victim.
He's perfecting
his face for her.
JOHN: Have you got her address?
All I have is a screen name.
With a little time,
I think I can track her
through her IP address.
She a brunette?
Yes.
Yes, she is.
I think I found her.
The food cartridges
are in the third bag.
Do you need any help, Judy?
No, I'm fine.
Thank you, Phil.
Okay.
See you next time.
ERIC: Judy...
Judy, it's Eric.
Eric?
I didn't mean to scare you.
Your, uh...
your door was open.
I meant it as a surprise.
Coming early, I mean.
You're beautiful.
Oh...
I'm sorry about the bandage.
Truth is,
I didn't want you
to see me like this.
But I can assure you
I won't be wearing it for long.
I'm sure you're beautiful.
As beautiful as the feelings
and the conversations
we've shared.
But I've kept
something from you.
What?
You're blind.
I should have told you.
I-I struggled with it
every time,
but I just...
I-I just liked you so much,
and-and you liked me,
and I didn't want it to end,
and I was afraid it would.
If you could love me...
then you would see
that I am the same person
that you began to know
and care about.
I just felt
that you were...
as lonely as I was.
Was I wrong?
No.
I don't care about your face,
or-or what you look like.
I just...
I'm so happy
that we found each other.
You're crying.
Eric! Eric!
Police! Police! Freeze!
Police!
Ms. Wood, stay where you are.
Suspect on premises.
It's over, Eric.
Come down from there, Eric.
Look, I understand
how you must be feeling.
It doesn't have
to end like this.
What's your name?
It's John.
Have you ever been loved, John?
I have.
Then you wouldn't understand.
We're supposed to be loved.
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
Do you think, with all
the people in this city...
in the world...
that there's someone
out there for everyone?
I do.
That's old-fashioned.
That's me.
Old-fashioned.
Even my robot's discontinued.
Do you want me to come
to a bar with you
and watch you drink?
No.
No, that's okay.
That, uh... got a little
weird last time.
Good night, John.
Hey, John.
Hey.
You going home?
Yeah, I was thinking about it.
I might head out for a drink.
You ever heard of
a place called Leo's? That's
actually where I'm going right now.
I love that place.
Come on.
You're kidding me. Really?
- Yeah.
- Detective Stahl.
VALERIE:
Hi.
I'm sorry. I'm...
not interrupting, am I?
No. No, not at all.
Jake, this is John.
Hey. How are you?
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Will I see you there?
Yeah. Yeah, I might swing along.
You know, but...
got a few reports
to finish, but...
You guys have fun.
Don't work too hard.
Worlds away
With memories
Of killing time and dreams
Think of me
It was so cold
We burned
And as they leave
They cross my mind
No time
I think it's over
This life inside
I seem to mind
Look in your eyes,
you're worlds away...
