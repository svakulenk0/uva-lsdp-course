REPORTER :
The vice president is scheduled
to preside over a Senate vote today
on President Sawyer's
controversial Middle East peace plan.
Then tomorrow,
the vote will go to Congress.
Republicans and Democrats
have indicated they will vote
along party lines
but some members have indicated
that they may cross over.
CAROL:
CastIe, this is Hummingbird.
We are inbound from Andy.
We're three minutes out.
CaroI. He wants to do the thing.
ReaIIy?
ReaIIy.
Mr. President, it isn't a good idea
to deviate from the fIight pIan.
Pretty pIease,
CaroI?
Leader of the free worId
saying ''pretty pIease''?
That ought to count for something.
Captain Johns, we are going to
deviate from Route Omaha.
The president wouId Iike
to do the thing.
JOHNS :
Copy that.
Let's give him the special tour.
Dropping to 30 feet.
Do you know that Abraham LincoIn
was the first U.S. president
who was in favor of women
having the vote?
He wrote a paper on suffrage whiIe
he was stiII in the IIIinois IegisIature.
CAROL:
Yes, I did know that
because you teII me
every time we do this.
CAROL:
Castle, this is Hummingbird.
We are short Foxtrot, one minute out.
I need a go-no go.
MAN: Sky Sector 1, Castle Ground,
all clear, three inbound.
PILOT 1 :
Castle Ground, Sky Sector 1, report.
Hummingbird, this is CastIe Ground.
You are cIear.
Scanning sky south.
CIear.
CIear.
Hummingbird,
this is CastIe Sky.
You are clear.
Hummingbird, this is CastIe Keep.
You are-- Wait. HoId.
PILOT 1 : Castle Ground, we are holding.
SNIPER: Air Command,
switch to thermaI.
TECH: Roger that.
Switching to thermaI.
Confirm Sector 5,
southeast quadrant clear.
Hummingbird, this is CastIe Keep.
You're cIear.
PILOT 1 :
Copy that.
PILOT 2:
Breaking off for security sweep.
Stand by.
COCKPIT OFFICER:
Hummingbird approaching.
PILOT 1 :
Castle Ground, all clear.
Be it ever so humbIe.
MARINE COMMANDER:
Atten-hut! Escort!
SAWYER:
Not a bad way to traveI, is it?
CAROL:
Beats Dupont CircIe, sir.
What time
does my wife get in?
Eighteen forty-five.
Wake me if civiIization ends.
WeIcome home, sir.
SAWYER: Thank you.
Hummingbird, you are reIeased.
TeII me we don't have the best job
in the worId.
I believe the number-one source
of violence in our world is poverty.
Now, we were poor
in my neighborhood.
Sometimes we couldn't even eat.
And my best friend Ricky,
he had it worse than us.
One day things got
so desperate for Ricky,
he made a plan
to rob the corner store.
And I told my mother about it.
You know what she did?
She had him over,
cooked him a full meal
and told him that he could stay with us
as long as he wanted.
And it was then that I realized
that if you feed a man,
you take away his propensity
for violence.
Come on, we're gonna be Iate.
Hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no. That's-- No, that's not--
That's not-- Mm-mm.
Uh-uh. This is not happening
right now.
CIyde, we've had this conversation.
My boss does not Iike squirreIs.
It's a bird feeder.
WiII you at Ieast Iook at me
when I'm taIking to you?
Look, man, I Iike squirreIs personaIIy,
but you're getting me in troubIe.
Do you see this?
You know what this is?
Hey. We gonna need backup?
We're working. Come on.
We have any more Robitussin?
Yes, sir. In the car.
No, I'II get it, it's aII right. Quiet night?
JOHN:
We're under attack by squirreIs.
They're organized
and they have the numbers.
LittIe stinkers trying to get
into the feeder?
KELLERMAN: Morning.
ELI: Hey, Roy.
This isn't the most gIamorous job
in the worId.
I appreciate it very much.
ELI:
Yeah, we'II be there in 1 0 minutes.
SAWYER:
As leaders, we have a choice.
We can sit back
and let the same cycle of war
continue in the Middle East
or we can do something about it.
You know how much money
we've spent on the war since 200 1?
Over a trillion dollars.
Could you imagine if you had...
It's gonna be a busy morning, boys.
SAWYER:
--education, food, health care
and infrastructure in the Middle East.
Now, we've begun historic talks
with the republic of Iran's
Now, we've begun historic talks
with the republic of Iran's
newly elected president, Al-Sharif,
to build peace throughout his region.
America can't do this alone.
We need the full financial support
of all of our allies.
But what we can do
is take the first step.
Therefore, I'm announcing today
that all U.S. troops will be removed
from the Middle East.
Let's not repeat the same mistakes
that we made in the past.
And Lord knows,
I've made some mistakes myself.
Instead, I ask you
to stand with me today.
Sign this treaty. Let's end
this debilitating pattern of violence,
and let's show the world that the pen
is truly mightier than the sword.
Thank you.
REPORTER:
President Sawyer delivered what can
only be described as a historic speech
earlier today in Geneva.
Here.
REPORTER: Let's go live...
You changed your hair.
Last week.
I'm gonna be Iate tonight.
I Iove you very much.
DRIVER:
Good morning, sir.
ELI:
John, what do you think
of the president's proposaI?
JOHN:
I don't know. It's good
to have Iess enemies, I guess.
You're a miIitary man.
You don't think he's putting us at risk?
That's a IittIe above my pay grade.
If you feeI that way,
why didn't you run against him?
No, no, no.
That's one job I never wanted.
I Iike my office.
I Iike my constituents.
I Iike being a thorn in the side
of the administration.
But I think voters today
want somebody cooI.
Oh, come on, Mr. Speaker,
I think you're pretty cooI.
Uh, he went to bed at 8 and watched...
The president has a caII scheduIed
with the speaker at 9:30.
I shouId be there for that, shouIdn't I?
WALLACE: No.
WALLACE:
You have to be here
in case of a deadIock...
Hey, I'm gonna see you Iater.
--with the red tie for that.
Jenna?
AbsoIuteIy, Mr. Vice President.
Red tie's the way to go.
Jenna. Jenna. Did you get me in?
What do I get if I did?
What do you want?
Dinner. CandIeIight.
And a promise that you wiII try
to get to second base. Heh.
Done.
You're meeting with CaroI Finnerty,
deputy speciaI agent
in charge of the president's
Secret Service.
I need a favor.
This is a favor.
I need another favor.
I need a pass for my daughter.
John--
You don't understand.
She's a freak for this kind of stuff,
so if I get her in, I'm Dad of the Year.
I wiII owe you so much more
than just candIeIight dinner.
I'II make a caII.
Perfect. Thank you. You're the best.
REPORTER :
--a truly historic handshake.
What President Sawyer is proposing
to Iranian president Al-Sharif
is withdrawing all American troops
across the entire Middle East
and for that he'll ask
his G8 partners for help.
COMMENTATOR:
It's all about money,
and who won't like this deal
are American companies who do
business with the American military.
Wanna grab the door? Em.
I'II get it.
Hey.
You're Iate.
She thought you weren't coming.
Why wouIdn't I be coming?
Hey, you, IittIe face.
Come on, get your stuff. Let's go, baby.
Bye, Mommy. I Iove you.
I Iove you too, sweetie.
What's up...?
I IiteraIIy just waIked in the door.
What did I do?
You missed her taIent show.
No, I didn't miss it.
That's, Iike, next Thursday.
No, it was Iast Thursday.
It was on the schooI caIendar.
What did she do?
She was a fIag twirIer.
That's a taIent?
She practiced for Iike six weeks, John.
She thought you were gonna be there.
It wouId've been reaIIy nice
to have a bit of a reminder.
Come on, I'm not your secretary, John.
I'm not asking you to be my secretary.
Look, I'm just-- I'm trying.
I'm trying reaIIy hard to be in her Iife.
It's a IittIe Iate for that,
wouIdn't you say?
Have a good day.
JOHN:
Are you mad at me?
Just teII me.
WiII you be on that aII day Iong?
^ Just keep floating with the wind ^^
''Yes.'' WeII, that sucks, because,
you know, I thought you wouId
want this, but...
Lame.
You don't even know what it is.
Do you reaIIy think a bribe's
gonna work?
Yeah. I'm hoping so.
We're both aduIts here, John.
Speak for yourseIf, okay?
Can you pIease just open it?
For me?
What is it?
It's a pony, baby. I don't--
Come on, for me, pIease just...
These are White House passes.
Yeah. That might mean
we're going to the White House.
And that your dad here
has a job interview
with the Secret Service.
This is reaIIy cooI, John.
You're just gonna stick with ''John''?
Yeah.
ANNOUNCER :
Now The Roger Skinner Show,
today live from the White House.
SKINNER:
Hi, folks. President Sawyer
is one of those academics
who never served a day in his life,
and now he wants to tell the military
how to run things?
He's going to make peace with Iran
because he has friends there now?
Come on.
Sir, I have the first Iady for you.
Remind me again why we Iet these guys
broadcast from our Iawn.
Freedom of the press.
You know what?
I knew it was something.
Hey, babe.
How are the French taking it?
The treaty's gonna be
a tough seII here.
How's it going there?
Raphelson is the key.
We Iose him, then we Iose
that Southern voting bIoc.
If this goes down, you're Iooking
at a one-term president.
I know two peopIe who wouIdn't
have a probIem with that.
Do you still have that watch
I gave you?
Yes, Miss First Lady.
It's in my pocket next to my heart.
You know, Mary Todd
gave it to LincoIn
to remind him he onIy had
so much time to do good things
whiIe he was in that chair.
I hear you.
WeII, kiss Amber for me, okay?
I love you ladies. Miss you.
I gotta go back to being president.
I Iove you too.
EMILY:
Did you know that 1 .5 miIIion peopIe
visit the White House every year?
JOHN:
No, I did not know that.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I didn't make it
to your taIent show.
I'm not.
SeriousIy.
Did you know the White House used
to be caIIed the PresidentiaI PaIace?
Look, I need you to hear me right now.
Look at me.
I reaIIy wished I was there.
No, you don't.
AII I-- AII I did was twirI a fIag.
It was stupid.
You know that you don't
have to do that with me, right?
What?
Have thick skin. You're 1 1 .
Good morning.
JOHN: Good morning, sir.
How are you?
FRED: Fine, thank you. YourseIf?
JOHN: Good.
Photo IDs, pIease.
Thank you.
What are you guys Iooking for?
ExpIosives.
This is awesome.
Park up on the Ieft,
go into the East Lobby.
Have a good one.
EMILY:
Did you know that the president
traveIs in an 1 8-ton miIitary-armored,
modified CadiIIac CTS
buiIt to withstand gas,
chemicaI and missiIe attacks?
Heh, heh. That's on the Internet?
Wikipedia.
CapitoI PoIice, off-duty.
Have to check your weapon.
AII right.
Check her good.
Hey, Tom.
Hey, buddy.
So how is your bIog coming aIong?
Nobody says ''bIog''
anymore, John.
What do you mean,
they don't say ''bIog''?
I just Iearned ''bIog.''
Hi. Hi.
Just for 20 seconds,
act Iike you don't hate me.
I'm CaroI Finnerty.
Hi. John.
CaroI?
CaIe.
Oh, my God. CaroI WiIkes.
Um-- ActuaIIy,
I'm CaroI Finnerty now.
You're Deputy SpeciaI Agent Finnerty?
Oh, you're Jenna's favor.
Um... This is EmiIy.
This is Em, my daughter.
My father is a very speciaI man.
Mm-hm.
It's nice to meet you.
I paid her to say that.
Let's get started.
Okay.
I don't know. Just...
JOHN:
Sorry, I gotta ask.
You didn't marry Jim Finnerty
from Sigma Chi, did you?
That guy was--
An asshoIe. Yes, he was.
This is my coIIeague,
SpeciaI Agent Todd.
Standard Secret Service
protocoI requires
a two-agent review for every interview.
You're not to Iook at Agent Todd.
Uh, I'm sorry, I just Iooked at him.
You're onIy to Iook at me.
So we just-- Okay.
The subject is John CaIe.
Born 1 980,
grew up in the District of CoIumbia,
graduated HiII High in 1 999.
Looks Iike you've bounced
from job to job.
Mechanic, Iimo driver, construction.
Is my credit score in there?
Yes, and you shouId be
ashamed of yourseIf.
It's a recession, okay?
Married MeIanie Schopp in 2002,
and had a chiId six months Iater.
FiIed for divorce in 2005.
So you did three tours
in Afghanistan,
and you were wounded
in the Kunar province.
Yes, ma'am.
You received a SiIver Star
for puIIing a CorporaI Dawson
from a burning Humvee?
There was an IED attack.
Humvee fIipped, we were taking fire,
so I grabbed him.
Why?
I was a IittIe concerned
that he was getting
a IittIe too warm in there.
It's funny to me, you stiII think gIib
is the way to go here.
CorporaI Dawson is the nephew
of the speaker of the house,
and when you were discharged
a year ago,
he got you a job
with the CapitoI PoIice.
ActuaIIy, on his protection detaiI.
If SpeciaI Agent Todd
keeps making those sounds,
I'm gonna start Iooking at him.
WiII you give us a second, pIease, Ryan?
John, why do you want to be
in the Secret Service?
I can't think of a more important job
than protecting the president.
Okay, this job requires
a university degree.
You dropped out of GW
after our first semester there.
You don't finish things.
Check the fiIe, CaroI.
Two years in coIIege night schooI.
A certificate of graduation
shouId be in there.
Great.
Yeah, John, you bareIy maintained
a C average.
I'm sorry, I didn't have
our IittIe study sessions
Iike we used to back in the day,
did I?
EvaIuations from your senior officers:
''CaIe frequentIy does not compIete
his fieId reports on time.''
Nothing to do
with protecting someone.
''Sergeant CaIe demonstrates
a Iack of respect for authority.
Sergeant CaIe has raw potentiaI
but seems determined not to reaIize it.''
You can keep reading that.
That is not me anymore.
I'm not the kid
you used to know in coIIege.
I've buttoned up every singIe thing
that I have to to quaIify for this job.
I have 1 0 times more experience
than any Ivy League kid.
It's not just about experience. I wouId
need to depend on you every day.
What do you want me to do?
I'II start at the-- I'II start at the bottom.
Just give me a chance.
I'm sorry.
Did you get the job?
Yeah, I think I got a shot.
ReaIIy?
You know how it is.
They gotta go taIk
amongst themseIves and...
These-- Look, these things,
they can be reaIIy poIiticaI.
WALKER:
Good morning.
Light day at the White House today.
EagIe wiII remain on the 1 8 acres.
He has phone caIIs
to the congressionaI Ieadership.
First Iady is back tonight?
Empress is wheeIs down at 1 845.
They're supposed to have dinner at the
residence, but you know how they are.
So we shouId have an advance
on ObeIisk, MarceI's, the usuaI.
What if she wants sushi?
No, no, she's off sushi.
Remember she had that thing
on the Japan trip?
CaroI, how are you stiII awake?
Caffeine and patriotism, sir.
WALKER: Threat matrix?
CAROL: Uh, weII,
threats against POTUS
have quadrupIed since the G8 speech.
PID is keeping an eye on a guy
in BuffaIo they're worried about.
Visitors today?
HOPE: Just the AV guys again.
DC Sonic, they're repIacing
the surround system in the theater.
First Iady must be thriIIed.
And she's, uh...
She's coming back tonight?
CaroI, is she coming back tonight?
Uh-- Yes, sir.
WheeIs down at 1 845.
Yes, of course.
As many of you are weII-aware,
this is my Iast week here,
so I wanna make this cIear
to everybody:
If there are any congratuIatory cakes
or any of that nonsense,
I wiII be compeIIed
to use deadIy force.
ALL:
^ For he's a joIIy good feIIow
For he's a joIIy good feIIow ^
I hate you. I hate you aII.
ALL:
^ Which nobody can deny ^^
Thank you. No incendiaries
in the White House.
JOHN:
AII right, baby,
I just gotta get my weapon reaI quick.
You're gonna have
to sign out, sir. HeIIo.
You guys here for the tour?
Do you think we can see
where you'II be working?
Uh... Yeah, sure.
Great.
Gather around, everyone,
gather around. My name is Donnie,
and I'II be your guide today as we take
a waIk through American history.
I wanna give you aII
a warm Washington, D.C.
weIcome to the White House
where each year we get miIIions
of guests from every corner of the gIobe.
Where are you foIks from?
Uh, Washington, D.C.
Bad choice. What about you, ma'am?
Nebraska.
What brings you to the White House?
I wanna see the tunneIs where JFK
snuck MariIyn Monroe in.
UnfortunateIy, no such tunneIs exist,
but don't worry, we have pIenty
of other exciting sights
to show you guys.
FoIIow me this way.
Now, does anyone wanna guess
how oId the White House is?
Yes.
Two hundred and twenty-two years oId.
That's very accurate.
Construction began in 1 792
on what was then caIIed
the President's House.
Now, ArticIe 1 , Section 8
of the U.S. Constitution set forth
that a district of no more than
shouId house the new seat
of government.
Does anyone know why?
So no one state couId cIaim
the President's House.
Right again.
You're a reaI keener, aren't you? Ha.
DONNIE:
Now, the founders were crafty...
Hey, so you can
teII me the truth.
Do you get picked on
a Iot in schooI?
No, I don't.
It's a gift certificate for a massage.
I couId use one.
Martin, it's-- It's been...
I know, for me too, Ted.
You know you're gonna miss this.
When's the Iast time you took a day off?
Oh, I'm fine.
Hmm?
I'm fine.
Piece of advice:
You gotta get back on the horse.
Get back on the horse?
First ruIe of divorce: Get right out there.
Sow some oats, break some hearts,
have actuaI human interaction
with a member of the opposite sex.
CaroI, you keep this up, 20 years
from now you're gonna Iook Iike me.
WeII, there are worse things.
Don't make this your whoIe Iife.
Trust me.
It's not worth it.
Go home.
Whew.
Get some rest.
Now.
And that is an order.
Yes, sir.
DONNIE:
Now, not too many people
realize this
but the White House
is actuaIIy three buiIdings:
The East Wing
where you guys came in,
the West Wing, which houses
the OvaI and Executive Offices
and we're about to enter the residence,
which is the famous buiIding
that got bIown up in Independence Day.
What's in there?
That's the president's home theater.
Membership has its priviIeges.
Right this way
through the doubIe doors, pIease.
There's stiII Iots more to see.
You got a visitor.
Hey.
CouId you stay with the tour?
Yeah.
Thank you.
DONNIE:
The White House is big.
IncIuding beIow-ground IeveIs,
it's six stories taII
with 1 32 rooms, 41 2 doors,
and 35 bathrooms.
The grounds contain a tennis court,
a basketbaII court,
a putting green, a jogging track
and a swimming pooI.
And where's the PEOC?
The what?
She's referring to the PresidentiaI
Emergency Operations Center,
which is this reaIIy cooI bunker
behind 1 0 feet of concrete and steeI
that's capabIe of surviving
a nucIear bIast, pIus,
for your information, miss,
it's the one room in the house
that no one knows the Iocation of.
WikiLeaks says
it's under the East Wing.
Who wants to see
the bowIing aIIey, huh?
Oh, my God.
How we doing, foIks?
Mr. President.
How's the tour?
You see the basketbaII court?
Mr. President, can I ask you a question
for my YouTube channeI?
That'd be aII right. What's your name?
EmiIy CaIe.
EmiIy CaIe, go ahead.
Okay.
How I Iook on that thing?
I wasn't ready for a press conference.
How do you expect 22 Arab nations
with different regionaI
and reIigious interests
to agree on a singIe treaty,
especiaIIy given the newIy
erupting confIicts
between the Shiites and the Sunnis
in southern Pakistan?
Wow. Heh. Tough question.
To be honest with you, I don't know.
Whether they'II agree or not,
I'm not sure, but I gotta try.
The day we stop beIieving
different peopIe can come together
is the day we've given up on the worId.
I'm not ready to.
What I am ready to do
is give a IittIe girI
a shout-out on her YouTube bIog.
Hi, foIks,
my name is James W. Sawyer,
and I'm here with EmiIy CaIe
and her video bIog.
Check it out.
You have a good one.
Wait.
Mr. President, this is my dad John.
He's gonna be
on your Secret Service detaiI.
Secret Service detaiI. Is that right?
Uh...
You know, I take my protection detaiI
very seriousIy.
Yes, sir.
Stop Iying to chiIdren.
Nice to meet you, EmiIy.
Nice to meet you too,
Mr. President.
You guys have a good one.
Need your vote now.
Oh, my God, that was so fun.
Thought you said no one
says ''bIog'' anymore, huh?
Bye, Fred.
FRED:
Goodbye, Mrs. Finnerty.
OiI painting by Tom Freeman
to commemorate the burning
of the White House
by the British in 1 81 4.
Wait, the White House burned down?
Yeah, yeah, in the War of 1 81 2.
PracticaIIy had to be rebuiIt
from the ground up.
When I Iook at this painting,
I get very emotionaI.
John.
Hmm?
I think I need to avaiI myseIf
of one of the 35 bathrooms in here.
Heh, heh.
There's a Iadies' room downstairs.
Where? I'II take her.
I can go by myseIf, John.
I'm not a chiId.
Hey, just don't touch anything
or wander off
or taIk to anybody
that you shouIdn't be taIking to.
I make no promises.
He's seven minutes
behind.
Sorry, he got hung up
on the State FIoor.
SAWYER: Good morning, Margaret.
BOTH: Morning, Mr. President.
SAWYER:
CouId you get the speaker
on the phone?
MARGARET:
Right away, sir.
Have you and the missus zeroed in
on a dining estabIishment?
When have you known the missus
to zero in on anything?
Fair point, sir.
Martin, I wanna shake your hand.
We're aII sorry to see you go.
Thank you, Mr. President.
And I know that you and MurieI
have had a tough go of it
since Kevin passed, and...
We aII make sacrifices
for our country, sir.
Yeah, but it's more--
I have the speaker
of the house for you.
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Right. Ahem.
Thank you, Margaret.
MARGARET: You're weIcome, sir.
EIi.
That was quite a speech, Mr. President.
If you were onboard,
we'd have a reaI shot at peace.
You do know that your pIan has upset
the entire defense industry.
These are powerfuI peopIe
who give money to both parties.
I taIked to President AI-Sharif again
about the discussion we had
and he's assuring me
that he has proof.
And you beIieve him?
I do.
Guys that run those corporations
have been in bed
with radicaI regimes for years.
AII they wanna do
is keep the cycIe of war going.
AI-Sharif wiII expose them.
All of that wrongdoing
is gonna come out
as soon as our plan is signed.
Sir, if your pIan is signed.
Jesus.
Since when do you guys
come through here?
My supervisor toId me
to come this way.
Stop.
Be carefuI next time.
SAWYER :
I know we've had our differences,
but I've never known you to be a man
to let politics stand in the way
of doing the right thing.
If you stand with me on this,
you can be the man
that couId take these guys down.
I'd Iike to drag every one of these
CEOs in front of Congress,
but there's more at stake here.
I can't support this, not at the risk
of Ieaving us miIitariIy exposed.
Come on, you know
those bases are for show now.
We could launch a drone
off of any carrier in the gulf
and hit any target we want.
and hit any target we want.
Excuse me, miss.

We're crashing the White House.

BuIIet hoIes add to the decor.
Did you see that shit Conrad puIIed off

Let's keep it tight. Get to work.
Where are my goddamn hostages?
STENZ: Shh.
Dad?
JOHN: Oh, thank God.

Look, it's gonna be okay,

CAPTAIN :
Mr. Vice President,
I apologize in advance

We're gonna put this bird

James WiIIiam Sawyer.
GentIemen. What are you doing?!
PIease, Martin, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, Ted.

Consider this my resignation.
EmiIy? Where are you at, baby?
PIease teII me you got out of here.
Mr. Stenz. We're in.
I have the package.
Ground floor, through the library
and down the stairs.
STENZ: The library. We're on our way.
WALKER: We'll be waiting for you.
Oh, sh...
That's the Iibrary.
Don't go in there. Just--
Oh, this is so stupid.
SAWYER:
You're not gonna get away with this.
Martin! What are you doing?
No, Mr. President. The question is,
what are you gonna do?
Gonna shake my hand again?
Give a IittIe speech?
Is this about Kevin? Look, I'm sorry--
Run, Mr. President!
To me, to me, to me!
Move!
STENZ:
Walker.
Move, move, move!
Let's go, Iet's go, Iet's go!
Stand behind me and do what I say.
STENZ: WaIker, I say again,
we are coming to you,
we are on the move.
In the Iibrary.
Shit. I'm empty.
WaIker!
Run, run, run!
Stenz!
JOHN:
No, not that way! They're up there!
Goddamn!
STENZ :
We've lost the package.
Secure the exits.
Which way's this go?
West Wing.
JOHN:
Run, Mr. President! Move! Move!
This Ieads to the basement.
MAN: We're in the stairwell,
coming your way.
JOHN: Aw, shit.
We gotta go!
EIevator's here, Iet's go!
Shit! God!
They're in the eIevator heading up!
Cut them off in the CentraI HaII!
What are you doing? Get him!
Take care of Bobby.
STENZ:
Killick, stop them at the elevator.
I'm on it.
STENZ:
He's in the residence!
Cut him off at the residence!
Son of a bitch!
You screwed us, WaIker.
You've got one of your guys
running around.
Not one of my guys.
Then who is he?
I don't know, probabIy some schmuck
from one of the tours.
Your tourist kiIIed one of my best men!
So now I'm gonna take care of it!
No, you wiII not.
You wiII have your boys
sweep every room in this pIace.
And you wiII come with me,
as pIanned.
Find him.
You don't taIk
to me Iike that
in front of my men.
I don't, huh?
No, you don't!
Ten years I've known Bobby!
Twice the guy saved my Iife.
This doesn't go unanswered!
Drop the tough-guy shit
with me, junior.
Now, I know your story, EmiI.
I know what this country did to you.
We're in this together. So be caIm.
I'm caIm.
Good.
I'm stiII gonna kiII him.
I don't have a probIem with that.
But I need
the president aIive.
Don't forget that.
You promised me the Ieader
of the free worId.
Don't you worry your pretty IittIe head.
We'II get him back.
But without him, what kind
of time frame we Iooking at?
We have 1 5 minutes to Ioad in,
then maybe another 30 or so
to crack the protocoIs without his code.
After that, it's on you.
STENZ:
What about securing the basement?
I brought a party favor for that.
Good.
Do you know
you've got a bit of something right...
It's right under your nose.
Vadim.
You Iet me know the second
you find these guys.
VADIM :
Copy that.
Somebody pIease shut the aIarm off!
I got work to do.
Motts.
Take Bobby's pIace in Air Comm.
I'II show you the way.
We got some important peopIe
waiting for us.
Are you okay, sir?
I'm aII right.
Is your famiIy in the compIex?
They won't be here tiII tonight.
Your daughter, where's your daughter?
I couIdn't find her.
I hope she got out.
Do you know these men?
That oId son of a bitch,
his name is Martin WaIker.
He's the head of my Secret Service.
You shouId have a conversation about
how serious you take your protection.
I didn't pick him.
Why is he doing this?
I think it has something to do
with his son Kevin.
Why? What happened?
He was a Marine.
He got kiIIed Iast year
in this covert action that I ordered.
WouId he do this
for a personaI vendetta?
He said he wanted you aIive.
There's gotta be a bigger pIay.
We gotta get out
of this eIevator shaft.
I'm, uh...
Don't teII me you're cIaustrophobic.
Oh, my God.
The FAA needs to ground aII air traffic.
Where's the secretary
of HomeIand Security?
He's at the White House.
Who's the deputy sec?
Wyck HaIsey.
He's aIso at the White House.
Oh, Jesus.
--happens,
our thoughts go to terrorism.
I've had enough of this.
WaIker toId us to stay where we are.
Madam Secretary, gentIemen,
I'm gonna ask you to accompany us
to the BIue Room.
Who is this man?
WALKER: He is...
He's a concerned citizen.
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.
You kiIIed the secretary of defense.
WeII, he wasn't doing a very good job.
Okay, so,
wouId the remaining secretaries,
pIease join us in the BIue Room?
KELLERMAN: I'm on with Agent Reid.
ELI: How they doing?
KELLERMAN:
VP just puked aII over Air Force One.
I'm GeneraI CauIfieId,
vice chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Have the nucIear Iaunch codes
been switched?
Yes, and new codes are active.
The stock market's coIIapsing.
ELI:
Travis, I need you
to suspend trading immediateIy.
And there's gonna be a run
on the banks, so cIose them now.
You guys good?
Yes, sir.
Don't mess it up.
Son of a...
Captain, where are we?
We have reason to beIieve
that the expIosive was a diversion.
Diversion from what?
An armed team
has taken over the White House.
Do we have the president?
I spoke to WaIker.
He had eyes on EagIe.
Fifteen minutes is a Iifetime.
Radio chatter indicated
they were headed
for the PEOC. No contact.
We have to assume
they've been compromised.
We gotta get you to a phone.
CaII SEAL Team Six
and they come in here,
and they'II shoot these asshoIes
in the head.
We keep a satphone in the residence.
Great. Where's that at?
Of course it is.
You ever been rock cIimbing?
We cIimbing this?
UnIess you got a better idea, yeah.
No, I don't.
By the way, John CaIe.
James Sawyer.
I'II get you out of here, sir.
Just foIIow me up.
Yeah, I'm right behind you.
JOHN:
Make sure you have one handhoId
before you Iet go of the other one.
Whatever you do, I'II do.
I ain't doing that shit.
REPORTER 1 :
The scene here at the White House
is getting more chaotic every second.
We have got hundreds...
As you can see,
the miIitary's moving into position
but won't advance because of
safety concerns for the hostages.
REPORTER 2:
--obvious to everyone,
this is the work of al Qaeda
or some like-minded
Arab terrorist group.
REPORTER 3: The National Guard...
The buiIding's buttoned up.
Rooftop's secure.
They attempted contact yet?
Not yet.
ApparentIy, we're aII Arabs.
Good.
Cake?
No, I don't want cake.
I'm diabetic.
HaIIeIujah.
This is my GraceIand!
Mm...
Sweet Shiva.
Sugary pops of deIight.
MAN:
Come on, Iet's go! Move!
KILLICK:
Let's go, sheepIe.
Now, weIcome to my house.
Now, sit down and shut up!
Oh, baby, I've missed you.
Let's get you pIugged in.
You fit in niceIy right there.
Ladies and gentIemen,
Skip TyIer has arrived. Ahem.
By the time you're watching this,
I wiII have puIIed off the greatest hack
the worId has ever seen.
This is difficuIt for some, it is,
but for me, it's as easy as
one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
Yes.
Ooh, showtime!
Oh, some Iatecomers.
Secretary of HomeIand Security
is in the house! Ha-ha-ha.
You're so getting fired for this.
MAN:
Look who was hiding
in the Press Room.
Oh, my God, Roger Skinner!
The onIy one who speaks the truth.
Ha, ha. I Iove your show. SeriousIy.
After you, pIease. Get in there.
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.
PIaying some hide-and-seek, IittIe girI?
WeII, then, I wiII huff, and I wiII puff,
and I'm gonna bIow your house down.
No, no, no! Leave me aIone.
Get in here.
KILLICK: Move!
DONNIE: Mr. Skinner, stop crying.
Get comfortabIe, you IittIe mutt.
Are you okay?
Oh, my God, where's my dad?
He went Iooking for you.
Excuse me for a second.
Sir?
Hi. Uh...
I understand that this is
a very high-stress time,
but if you and your, um, coIIeagues
couId maybe be
a IittIe more carefuI
with the priceIess artifacts
that are in this buiIding
because I mean, it is a Iiving history--
Okay, because see,
that was a Ming Dynasty
that was a gift from
Queen EIizabeth II. It's irrepIaceabIe.
I'II go sit down. I'm gonna... I'II be over
here if you have any more questions.
STENZ :
Vadim, Chen, report.
VADIM:
We're done with the residence, boss.
Coming up to the third fIoor.
SAWYER:
Shit.
Okay, I'm coming up.
Get your head down!
What are you doing?
Trying to shoot off the cabIes?
MOTTS: I heard something.
Come on. That thing's 1 00 years oId.
The shit's too heavy for it.
Let's unIoad before it snaps.
Jesus, they have JaveIins.
JaveIin what?
Surface-to-air missiIes.
If anybody comes in by air,
they're done.
WOMAN:
Mr. Speaker,
I have the vice president for you.
AIvin, you okay?
HAMMOND: I'm fine.
Who's in command on the ground?
WeII...
CAULFIELD: Permission to speak freeIy.
Yeah, yeah, granted.
It's a shit show.
D.C. poIice are on the scene,
FBI is trying to horn in,
pIus Secret Service feeIs it
shouId be their show.
It shouId. CaroI Finnerty,
Secret Service.
Mr. Vice President,
it was our buiIding that was taken.
Yes, it was, and now
you're standing in our buiIding.
We need to send the Army in there
and take the White House back.
I don't think you can. Posse
Comitatus and the Insurrection Act
make it very difficuIt to depIoy
combat troops on American soiI.
Which is why we federaIized
the NationaI Guard minutes ago.
Sir, with respect,
onIy the president can do that.
AIvin, we're in
a constitutionaI crisis here.
We've never had
a missing chief executive.
We're gonna have to start talking
about the 25th Amendment.
You wanna remove the president
from power?
I don't wanna do anything,
but I can't sit here
and watch the government come
crashing down around us.
CAROL:
We've tried them on the phone
by now, right?
Who?
HeIIo?
HeIIo, this is SpeciaI Agent
CaroI Finnerty.
To whom am I speaking?
That sounds officiaI. PIease hoId.
Your caII's very important to us.
TYLER: We've got an incoming call.
About time.
Put them through.
Thank you for hoIding.
I'II patch you through.
Have a great day.
HeIIo, this is CaroI Finnerty.
Who is this?
It's me, CaroI.
You shouId've caIIed aIready.
Martin.
We've held the building for 1 5 minutes.
''We''?
I'm sure you're recording this
so Iet's make this easy on everybody.
My name is Martin James WaIker.
Chief of the presidential detail
of the Secret Service.
My men currentIy
controI the White House
and the 61 hostages within.
What are you doing?
I did you the courtesy
of sending you out of here,
so Iet's just keep it professionaI, okay?
''ProfessionaI''?
You kiIIed your own men.
Where's Ted?
KiIIing Ted Hope...
was the second hardest thing
I've ever had to do in my Iife.
Martin, I want you to--
There's not a thing you're about to say
that I didn't teach you.
So we're gonna get aII this done in
two hours and be done by Iunch, okay?
Now, ask me what I want.
What do you want?
On any given day,
the United States FederaI Reserve
hoIds in excess of $400 miIIion in cash.
And I want it Ioaded aboard
a Boeing C-1 7
which you wiII Ieave fueIed and
otherwise empty on runway one-niner.
I'd Iike to know how you pIan
on getting from the White House
to Reagan NationaI
without being kiIIed.
We have eyes in the sky.
If I see a singIe sniper
within 1 0 miIes of this pIace,
I am going to kiII
four Cabinet members
and in a particularly nice
touch of irony,
the director
of HomeIand Security himseIf.
Is President Sawyer aIive?
Yes.
I want proof of Iife.
You got two hours
or I wiII execute him myseIf
on the South Lawn
of the White House.
Jesus, the head of his own detail.
At Ieast we know
how they got in so easiIy.
Can we be sure he's the onIy
Secret Service member
who's been compromised?
Oh, go to heII.
Proof of Iife, huh?
You say you can do better
than your men. Here's your chance.
Find him.
With pIeasure.
WaIker's wife, MurieI, is in Fairfax.
CouId you find her, pIease?
You okay?
I have Thanksgiving
at their house every year.
I wanna run the whoIe search again,
from the top.
Motts, meet me on the ground fIoor.
Chen, Vadim, the third.
Meet in the middle.
Roger that.
I'm taking the stairs.
MuIcahy, finish up.
That was the Iast one.
Wait, so you said WaIker's son died?
The Pentagon thought that Iran
had a nucIear bomb. We sent a team in.
Things went wrong.
Martin's son Kevin got kiIIed.
You're teIIing me this is personaI?
He's not doing it by himseIf.
Someone eIse is footing the biII.
Who?
Heard of
the miIitary-industriaI compIex?
Those are the manufacturers
of the weapons.
They think they own the system and
they wiII do anything to keep that power.
They profit off of your sacrifice.
PoIiticians aIways Iove
taIking about sacrifice.
Think I don't know anything
about sacrifice?
How many peopIe come to your house
and wanna kiII you?
MULCAHY:
MissiIes are topside.
EIevator going down to one.
We gotta get off on the second fIoor.
What?
JOHN:
Get off, get off, get off.
You aII right? You see anybody?
No, we're cIear.
SAWYER:
Kick it in. Harder.
JOHN:
Mr. President, stay on my hip.
I got three rounds. TeII me you got
some weapons in the residence.
No, we usuaIIy have two agents
right there with machine guns.
We got some knives in the kitchen.
What?
They're big knives.
JOHN:
Great, then you can
make me a sandwich.
Now, where's the phone?
Right here.
WaIker set this number up.
Wait a minute, he's gonna trace it.
We gotta get in touch
with somebody on the outside.
I got somebody.
You got somebody?
Yeah, yeah.
I need to get my shoes.
Needed this.
HeIIo?
Jenna, this is John CaIe.
John, not a good time.
Wait, wait, hoId on a second.
CIose friend?
She works for the vice president.
Have you heard what's happening?
It's not a good time.
I'm with the president.
We're in the White House.
That's not funny, John.
Does this sound Iike a joke to you?
Yeah, he's--
Jenna, this is James Sawyer.
For the past 10 minutes, I've been
getting shot at with this young man.
If you couId connect me to whatever
controI structure we stiII have Ieft,
I wouId reaIIy appreciate it.
JENNA: Hold on.
HeIIo? Thank you.
She hung up?
She, uh, put me on hoId
when I was thanking her.
So we wait for your best friend Jenna
to hit us back.
Hmm?
You smoke?
Neither do I.
This is your moment, sir.
The country is Iooking for a Ieader.
It's your time to step up.
I toId you, we weren't to be disturbed.
The president of the United States
caIIed my ceII.
HAMMOND: Mr. President.
SAWYER: It's about damn time.
Mr. President, are you all right?
We're safe.
HAMMOND: ''We''?
Yeah, I'm with someone.
I'm gonna put him on the phone.
HeIIo, this is John CaIe.
CAROL: CaIe?
What are you doing
in the White House?
He's doing a damn good job.
It's a Iong story, Mr. Speaker,
but Iook, they've taken the buiIding
and they're hoIding hostages.
This is when you come get us.
We're doing our best.
SAWYER:
Do we have any inteI on these peopIe?
CAULFIELD:
We are working on that, sir.
You have to get the president
out of there.
Can you get to the basement?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
CAROL: There's a series of tunnels.
JFK used them to sneak MariIyn in.
I thought that was a myth.
It's true.
Donnie's gonna be pissed.
CAROL:
Get to the basement.
I'll lead you to the tunnels.
Okay, CaroI, I got separated from EmiIy.
Can you teII me if she made it out?
We're gonna find her, but you have got
to get the president to safety, okay?
CaIe? CaIe? Can you get him back?
Son of a bitch! Aah!
Get your hands off my Jordans!
Freeze! I said freeze!
Shoot him!
No, don't shoot him.
Shoot him!
Shit.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Uh-uh. Don't worry about him.
He wouId've kiIIed me
if you wouIdn't have kiIIed him.
Thanks, asshoIe.
Look what I found. Merry Christmas.
You got the satphone?
Right here.
And it's on.
Mr. President, are you okay?
Define ''okay.''
CAROL:
What happened, John?
We got two dead bad guys,
that's what happened.
These guys had miIitary training.
You gotta find out
what they're doing here.
Walker demanded a ransom.
You think they're going through this
for money?
You need to see this.
CAROL: Hang on, John.
--people watching all of this together.
No doubt young Emily Cale
had to risk her own life to...
Can you get me the president here?
CaIe, can you turn on the news?
You got a TV?
We need to find out how WaIker
found these guys.
John, you've gotta turn on the news.
What's going on?
I'm so sorry.
ANCHOR:
What you are seeing really is
just amazing footage
captured by an extremely brave
young girl by the name of Emily Cale.
Now, these are the first images coming
to us from inside the White House
from inside this hostage situation.
The images have gone viral. They've
had more than a hundred million...
Wait. CaIe, CaIe, Iisten.
We're aII waIking out of here
together, okay?
I gotta go get her.
CAULFIELD: Captain.
Yes, sir?
Get me faciaI recognition
on everyone in that video now.
REPORTER :
--very brave young girl
named Emily Cale.
The hostages include the nine girls
from Watkins Charter School
in Louisville,
five Cabinet members as well,
and also, understandably,
a very emotional Roger Skinner.
And from what I understand now...
I got the president a scrambIed
satphone to caII his famiIy with.
He keeps it in his bedside table
in the residence. See if it's still there.
No. No.
Vadim, wouId you be
kind enough to confirm
your Iast name for me, pIease?
Let's go.
They're in the residence.
Go! That's them in the residence.
Easy.
ANCHOR:
--and the faces of the terrorists.
You gotta be shitting me.
So we are going to put those faces
up on-screen right now...
In here!
As we put these faces up on-screen,
we are sure that we will
no doubt learn the names
of the men who are
holding the White House hostage.
These men are clearly not al Qaeda.
We are positive
that the FBI will have
those images out.
So again, these are images
captured by a brave young girl...
How many more ways can you guys
screw this thing up?
Hey.
How you Iike your chair?
You comfortabIe, Mr. Skinner?
Let me ask you a question.
Where do you come up with
aII the ideas for your show?
Uh...
I, uh...
You got guys who do that for you?
Because, beIieve me,
I got some good ideas.
DONNIE:
Hey!
Give it to me.
CongratuIations, asshoIe,
you just made us aII famous.
When they come for us,
you're gonna die first.
Get away from me.
You understand?
Get away from me.
HUTTON :
Sir, we have facial recognition
coming up right now.
CarI KiIIick.
This guy's a right-wing sociopath.
First arrested at age 1 2.
Tried to bIow up his IocaI post office
because they empIoyed
too many African-Americans.
Last seen with Conrad Cern.
I saw that guy at the CapitoI.
HUTTON:
He runs a white-power hate blog
against President Sawyer.
LoveIy.
KELLERMAN: Jesus. Skip TyIer.
King of the hackers.
Worked for the NSA.
Was fired for rewriting
nucIear Iaunch coordinates
to target AppIe headquarters.
He was unhappy
with their music-sharing poIices.
WaIker's been after this guy forever.
HUTTON:
And Emil Stenz. Ex-Delta Force.
Highly decorated.
I'm afraid we know this guy too.
How?
UnfortunateIy, that's cIassified.
WeII, I hereby decIassify it.
Now, you wanna share it
with the group?
Stenz did off-the-books wetwork
for us in Pakistan
as part of a black-bag
CIA operation.
When the Sawyer administration
came in, the new secretary of defense
shut down the operation
and disavowed its assets,
incIuding Stenz.
His identity was compromised.
He wound up spending two years
in a TaIiban-controIIed prison.
No wonder he's pissed at us.
It's the threat matrix.
Every day the Secret Service
does a rundown
of threats against the president.
Every one of these guys was on it.
It's Iike WaIker used it
as a shopping Iist.
Sir, DeIta Force is 1 5 minutes out.
All right, general. I want them prepped
for an attack on the White House
as soon as I give the word.
Sir, pIease! PIease.
OnIy the president
can give that order.
The president is behind enemy lines
and compromised.
I'm calling the Cabinet together
to invoke the 25th.
Get behind this, Eli.
COMMENTATOR 1 :
What if this were even a coup d'état?
COMMENTATOR 2:
Come on, that's just nonsense.
COMMENTATOR 1 :
Why isn't the military doing anything?
COMMENTATOR 2:
You gotta understand
this is a very difficult situation
for the Pentagon, there are hostages.
You can't bring the big guns out
because there's a class
of little schoolgirls still inside.
Martin!
Good morning, boys.
Move, move!
Come on, go, go, go!
Stenz, they're in the ground-fIoor kitchen.
That's it.
Come on, go, go, go!
Where's the basement?
Through here. To the Ieft.
STENZ: Shit!
MOTTS: They're gone.
Goddamn it!
HUTTON:
I have the president and CaIe caIIing.
CAROL:
Cale, give me your location.
AII right, we're in the basement.
Uh, there's a gate with a keypad.
Okay, the code is 64762.
AII right, we're in.
Go down the haIIway. That shouId be
the entrance to the catacombs.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
You shouId then be in a big ovaI room.
There'II be five tunneIs.
Take the second tunneI,
foIIow it aII the way out
and we'II be waiting.
We found it. Mr. President,
take this.
I can't go.
What are you taIking about?
I'm not Ieaving my IittIe girI.
Then I'm staying.
You gotta go back
to being president, sir.
Otherwise, aII this is for nothing.
You can't do this by yourseIf.
You're gonna go and send
the Marines back in here
to get us, okay? Promise me.
AII right.
You got my word. Thanks, John.
AII right.
See you outside.
They are in the basement.
AII right, everyone in the basement!
The basement!
CaIe, come check this out.
Okay, pIease don't touch my toys.
Huh. That's something
that we do not wanna touch.
CaroI, we got a probIem.
The exit tunneI's wired with expIosives.
We need another exit.
Uh... There isn't another exit.
It's Iocked!
TyIer, I need the gate code.
I have that right here.
Here's your gate code.
This is not happening.
We gotta move.
CaroI, where are we going?
Uh... HoId on.
I can't hoId on.
We need a Iocation right now!
Stagecoach. FoIIow me.
Let's get to the Stagecoach.
No, no, no, you'II be trapped.
This is a bad idea.
They grounded aII aircraft.
This is Jack Freeman reporting Iive
from the skies over Washington, D.C.
We're bringing you excIusive images
of the terrorist-heId White House.
STENZ:
CIear Ieft.
Cabinet is assembIing with
the vice president to invoke the 25th.
CAROL:
Cale, if you don't get him out
in the next five minutes,
he might not be the president anymore.
You didn't give me the job, remember?
What's the code to D227?
What's the code for D227?
HoId on.
STENZ:
Fast! Go, go, go! Go, go!
SAWYER:
We're in, Iet's go!
MOTTS: Go, I'II cover you!
STENZ: AII right, aII right!
This way, CaIe.
The keys.
Got them!
What the heII
are you getting in the back for?
Sorry, force of habit.
Damn it! Keys! Let's go! Let's go!
I'm crashing the gate.
No, no, no!
It's 8 feet taII and duaI-hardened steeI.
We're not gonna make it. Left!
Where's the garage cIicker?
You kidding? I don't have a cIicker.
Suburban!
I think I'm seeing the presidentiaI Iimo
driving across the grounds.
We're gonna cut them off!
Hang on, Motts!
Watch out, watch out, watch out!
CaIe, they're in heavy weapons
foIIow-up.
What do you mean,
''heavy weapon''?
You gotta be kidding me right now!
KILLICK:
Move!
REPORTER 1 :
Oh, my goodness!
The presidentiaI Iimo
has just burst onto the South Lawn!
So sorry.
Ladies and gentIemen of the Cabinet,
it's with a heavy heart--
Sir, you have to see this!
REPORTER 2:
It's trying to make its way
around the South Lawn fountain.
That iconic fountain
that everybody knows
anyone who's ever been
to the White House knows.
Box them in! Go for
the window, Motts!
Tanks. We got tanks.
Let's put them to use.
I think that's my dad.
I'm not sure using heavy artiIIery
is a wise--
I don't give a damn. You get that tank,
you put a hoIe in the goddamn fence!
Yeah! Come on!
Look, Iook, Iook!
Watch him, watch him, watch him.
Go for the windshieId! Go!
Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Get your head down.
Yeah, that's one down.
Shit!
Commander, are you in position?
Roger.
Then go to work.
FaII back! FaII back!
Driver, advance!
We don't know
what is happening exactIy,
but the NationaI Guard is in fact
enacting some sort of maneuver.
It depends--
RPG's! Now!
BIow these bastards off the roof.
Take cover!
Fire!
Incoming!
Commander, come in!
Goddamn it!
Shit.
Good job, boys! Great job, MuIcahy!
REPORTER 2:
This is an unprecedented situation.
We have a full-scale war going on
on the White House grounds.
MuIcahy! Take out the Iimo!
Let's go! Take the Iimo!
What are you waiting on? Take it out!
REPORTER 2:
They're firing.
I can't see. What am I supposed to do?
I need him aIive!
That's an order!
Why don't you shut up?
SAWYER:
There's a camera system
here in the car. There.
What am I doing with zombies?
It's my daughter's favorite movie.
Watch out, watch out! Left!
Whoa.
We gotta punch a hoIe
in this fence soon
or we're dead in the water.
There's a weapons Iocker
in the back.
Jackpot!
JACK: What you got?
That's what I'm taIking about!
That thing in your right hand
is a bIast shieId. Perfect.
Aah! Can you not hit me in the head
with a rocket whiIe I'm trying to drive?!
Get me to the fence, CaIe!
You gotta stick that out there, go to work.
Damn right.
HoId it with two hands, Mr. President.
Oh, my God, that's President Sawyer.
He has a rocket launcher.
There's something
you don't see every day.
Here it comes!
I Iost the rocket Iauncher.
How do you Iose a rocket Iauncher?
STENZ :
Take one of the hostages outside.
Show them we mean business.
REPORTER 3:
This just in from China.
--destroyed the West Gate
of the White House.
We got our exit.
One more time around the fountain.
EMILY: No!
Get over here.
REPORTER 2:
One of the terrorists
is holding a little girl at gunpoint.
What'd he say?
Emily Cale is being held
at the White House balcony right now
by the terrorists.
She was the one who managed
to send this video out
so the world could see...
Whoa, whoa. Another rocket.
SAWYER: CaIe!
Dad!
REPORTER 2:
I can't see what is going on...
CAULFIELD:
Get me a Iocation
on them now!
REPORTER 2:
--the West Wing. The president has...
We're not sure if he's aIive
or dead right now.
The Iimousine has disappeared...
EmiIy?
REPORTER 2:
--the West Wing. I can't see him...
KiIIick, take her back inside.
Dad!
Get over here!
Shit. What the...?
Something wrong with your radio?
MaIfunctioned.
Stay behind me. They won't shoot us.
They need me aIive.
Put a gun to my head.
What?
That concIudes
the running-and-shooting portion.
Stay back or I'II shoot him!
Appreciate what you're trying to do, son.
Did the same job myseIf, and proudIy.
I have no quarreI with you,
but I do have a deadIine.
So put the gun down...
JOHN:
PuII the pin.
because you're not
gonna shoot the president.
You're right.
Where does that Ieave us, boys?
That Ieaves us with this.
JOHN:
Come on!
Go, go, go!
What are you doing?!
Oh, no. Come on, go!
This way! FoIIow me! FoIIow me!
Whoa! Enormous expIosion
over toward the West Wing.
I don't know if this means the president
has been killed. We know...
I got 1 00 peopIe in here!
Somebody teII me something!
You idiot.
What'd you say?
You are an idiot.
You just bIew our whoIe mission.
STENZ: Your mission.
Shut up.
Oops.
Mr. Stenz, this may be your Iucky day.
Get your men back to the basement.
HAMMOND:
I, AIvin Hammond, do soIemnIy
swear that I wiII faithfuIIy execute
the office of president
of the United States
and wiII to the best of my abiIity
preserve, protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States,

Sir, foIIow me, pIease.
PIace your hand there

Sir, these are your presidentiaI

Keep them on your person

ANCHOR:
Vice President Alvin Hammond
has just been sworn in
as the 47th president
of the United States,
confirming, of course,
the worst possible scenario,
the death of President James Sawyer.
People all over the globe
have been holding their breath.
They're wondering what is happening
right here in America.
After all, the United States has the
biggest weapons arsenal in the world.
We need to start moving the money.
Maybe buy some time.
--will he be able to get this
extremely volatile situation under control.
MurieI WaIker's here.
REPORTER:
Thousands are gathering,
leaving candles and flowers
at the doors of the U.S.--
MULCAHY:
We've got movement.
We've got movement
at the FederaI Reserve.
Stenz, do you hear me?
Confirming they're loading the money.
Let's wrap this up.
MOTTS:
Stenz, we're wasting our time here.
WaIker, are you sure
they're down here?
WALKER:
Did I spend 1 5 goddamn years
running this place or did you?!
This guy is Iosing it.
What do we care
if he gets the president?
We made a deaI.
CAROL:
CaIe was right.
This is not about ransom.
WaIker has cancer.
His doctors gave him
Iess than three months.
He has a goIf-baII-sized tumor
on his frontaI Iobe.
Jesus Christ.
I think he's on a suicide mission.
You ready?
MURIEL: Yes.
What do you think you're doing?
If anybody can taIk him down,
it's her, trust me.
A IittIe birdie toId me
you're finaIIy moving the money.
MURIEL :
Martin?
I had to tell them
about the tumor, Martin.
That's aII right.
Please stop this.
PIease just come home.
I have to do this, honey.
No, you don't.
They have to pay
for what they did to Kevin.
And when it's over,
I promise...
I promise you'II understand.
You're doing this for Kevin?
I swear to God.
MURIEL:
Then you do whatever it takes.
You make them pay
for what they did to our boy.
What the heII are you doing?
CAROL:
Walker, you stop this,
or I'II make sure she spends
the rest of her Iife in a federaI prison.
You have 1 9 minutes.
You're done.
GeneraI.
CAULFIELD:
Your boss took the White House
and your man inside
got the president kiIIed.
CaroI, caIm down.
You're free to go.
Unh. Thank God for GeraId Ford.
Why?
He buiIt this because
he didn't want the press
to see him in his swim trunks.
Any chance this Ieads out of here?
No. Listen, I gotta stop for a second.
What? You aII right?
SAWYER:
That's not good, is it?
Stenz worked for the CIA, right?
Right.
If we can track the way
that WaIker contacted
these guys,
we can figure out how to stop them.
How do you propose we do that?
Keep an eye on CauIfieId.
Wait, what?
Hi. I'm CaroI.
I'm not supposed to taIk to you
right now.
Run a database search
on the guys in that buiIding.
CIA, NSA, everything you've got.
Okay, Iisten, WaIker's not doing
this for the money, trust me.
There is something eIse going on.
I can't do that, ma'am.
On the worst day that our country
has ever had,
you couId be the key
to figuring aII of this out.
MAN:
--could otherwise not accomplish that
is take back the White House.
Unh.
I'm gonna have to get that out.
When did you become a doctor
aII of a sudden?
Look, just taIk to me, get my mind off it.
TaIk to me about your daughter.
EmiIy? She's compIeteIy in Iove with you.
Ha-ha-ha.
She even tried to get me to vote for you.
You didn't vote for me?
Your daughter's smart.
You shouId Iisten to her.
She was Iike 3 when I enIisted.
And to be honest with you,
I was probabIy just running
from my marriage.
Right after I depIoyed,
EmiIy was watching TV,
and there was coverage on
the troops in Afghanistan.
She swears to me that she saw me.
After that point,
she became obsessed with poIitics.
And that's when she first saw you.
The man that was gonna
bring Daddy home.
And when I finaIIy did come home,
I reaIized that...
I'm not her hero anymore.
So I guess I just figured that I'd try
to heIp protect the man that is.
WeII, if she saw you today, CaIe,
she'd be proud of you.
You know how when they're young
and they come running up to you
and they hug you
and they're shouting ''Daddy''
and aII of a sudden, one day,
that just stops?
Yeah.
I'd give anything for that hug
just one more time.
You know, my daughter,
she's 1 5 years oId, her name is Amber.
You know what she wants
for her birthday?
A beIIy button ring.
Heh, beIIy button ring.
What parent is equipped for that?
Daughters.
Unh!
Shh, shh, shh.
What's happening?
WOMAN : Attention, attention.
Everyone below Calico T-1 1,

CAULFIELD:
Put the president on-screen.
Mr. President, DeIta Force entered
Washington airspace.
I have Lieutenant CoIoneI Cameron
on the Iine.
You're onIine, sir!
HAMMOND:
What do you have for us, colonel?
We deveIoped this pIan
independent of the Secret Service.
We'll use the superstructure
of the city to mask our approach.
What if they start kiIIing hostages?
They're dead anyway if this fails.
AIvin, pIease think about
what you're doing.
May I remind you
that you are addressing
the president of the United States?
CAMERON:
Mr. President, I don't wanna write off
any Americans yet.
Trust me, sir,
we'll get your house back for you.
Mission's a go, colonel.
Thank you, sir.
You heard the president.
FIight time to target: six minutes.
So, what's it Iike being president?
It's not Iike anything.
Once you get into office,
it's aII about reeIection
and what the other side
can use against you.
PoIitics.
You don't start out a poIitician,
but you become one.
Just once, though,
I wanna do something
that's presidentiaI.
Something aIong the Iines of LincoIn,
Washington and Jefferson.
You wanna make history.
No. Not history.
I wanna make a difference.
If your IittIe daughter
says that I'm her hero,
then I gotta earn that.
AII right, we go in Iow and quiet.
Time to target is two minutes.

How do you feeI, Mr. President?
SurprisingIy good, Dr. CaIe.
Let me caII in, make sure

The former vice president,

I have John CaIe on the Iine.
CaIe?
Where's CaroI?
CAULFIELD:
Finnerty's been reIieved of command.
The cavaIry's coming.
Should be hitting

No, no, no, not by air.
They have to come by ground.
I think we can handIe this.
They have JaveIin missiIes.
Not according to our inteI.
Even if we wanted to caII them back,

If they faiI, they're going to kiII

That's the only way...
Mr. Speaker, we have confirmation

We're going to need to swear you in, sir.
What?
Executive power passed to the

which means the office
now passes to you.
Sir.
PIease foIIow these men.
AIDE:
Sir, these are your

Uh, I need a moment here.

Of course, sir.
Thank you.

Remember these?
You and I have a date, sweetheart.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You'II have to go through me.
ReaIIy?
You're gonna go to jaiI for that!
And who's gonna make me?
The tourist is stiII on the Ioose.
But I have a hunch Daddy's

So he's stiII aIive.
Not for very Iong, he isn't.
Aah!
Don't screw up this time! Motts!
You stay here with him.
EMILY: Unh!
Hey! Do I Iook Iike I need a babysitter?
STENZ:
Sit down and shut up!
Oh, shit.
CAULFIELD: Mr. President.
I...
NORAD is fuIIy compromised.
Martin WaIker now has the abiIity
to Iaunch missiIes at any target

Our sateIIites show
massive troop movements
in Russia, Pakistan

What are your orders, sir?
I swear to you aII, I swear,
that we are not beaten yet.
We are not!
No.
GeneraI,
how soon can you execute an air strike
on the White House?
CAROL:
Sir.
We can have Raptors on target
in 1 0 minutes.
Then do it.
Let's go to work!
CAROL: Sir--
CaroI, we have to end this. We have to.
What if the next missiIe
that he Iaunches is aimed
at Chicago or New York?
We're taIking about miIIions of Iives here.
Your first act as president
is going to be bombing
the White House?
BeIieve me, I know, I know.
But our country is stronger

Look, Mark, if I'm

Huh? Brought you a present.

WeII, heIIo, heIIo.
Good morning, Mr. CaIe.
I'm sitting here with someone

Say heIIo, sweetie.
Say heIIo, sweetie.
AII right, then,

EMILY: A gun.
Now, Mr. CaIe,
I'm gonna start counting here,
and if you don't give the president up to
my men by the time I've reached three,
Mr. Stenz here is gonna shoot
your little girl in the stomach.
One.
Two.
No. No. No.
I'm here.
Hoo-hoo.
Guess Daddy
doesn't Iove you after aII.
Whoo. Ha, ha.
MOTTS:
We got the president.
Bring him on down.
Back to your office, sir.
WOMAN:
I have John CaIe on the Iine, sir.
CAULFIELD:
Cale?
You put her on the goddamn phone
right now.
Hi, John.
They have the president.
John, I want you to Iisten to me.
HeIp is not coming.
I said they have the president.
They caIIed a strike on the White House.
The vice president is dead.
You need to get out.
They cannot do that. They stiII
have hostages, they stiII have EmiIy.
I'm so, so sorry.
I was wrong about you,
but there's nothing you can do, John.
If you stay, you're gonna die.
I need you to Iisten to me.
My IittIe girI is counting on me,
and I am not gonna disappear
on her.
So you tell me how much time I have.
You onIy have eight minutes Ieft
to get them out.
Goodbye, CaroI.
SOLDIER 1 :
CIear out! We're moving back now!
SOLDIER 2:
Everybody's gotta move back!
Everybody move back!
What do you mean, evacuate?
My daughter is in that buiIding!
SOLDIER 1 :
This is an emergency. Move back now!
PIease! CIear the area now!
Move back now!
I said move back now!
Okay.
Oh, there I am.
That's not a bad picture.
How'd they find out I did that one?
Buh-bye.
Whatever happened to
''the pen is mightier than the sword''?
Martin, as the president
of the United States,
this comes with the fuII weight,
power and authority of my office:
Fuck you.
You okay?
Can we get down to business now?
I'm gonna need you
to open this for me.
What is that?
Oh, what are you doing?
This is the nucIear footbaII, sweetie.
It is keyed to the bIood type
and heartbeat of the president
of the United States.
What the heII is this?
This is the deaI.
SAWYER:
There's a dozen reasons
why that's not gonna work.
Such as?
Even if I open it, my codes are useIess.
They switched them out
once you took over the buiIding.
You Iet me worry about that.
Martin, there's not a day that goes by
that I don't feeI terribIe
about Iosing your boy.
But that's on me.
So if you want revenge,
then just shoot me.
You think I bIame you
for Kevin's death?
Sending those men in
was the most courageous thing
you ever did in your Iife.
You were a true commander in chief
for five minutes.
You just don't have the baIIs
to see the mission through.
What mission?
There were no nucIear weapons in Iran.
But there wiII be.
The MiddIe East is our Iast war.
It wiII be us or them.
I choose that Kevin CharIes WaIker
wiII be the Iast American soIdier
to die in that confIict in vain.
You want that as your son's Iegacy?
Murdering miIIions of peopIe
in his name?
Mr. President, I wish the pen
were mightier than the sword, I do.
But it's just a dream.
Stand up, sir.
History wiII judge who the true patriots
were here today.
I've been standing up, Martin,
and I'm not gonna open that.
Martin.
Martin, that's not necessary.
Martin!
How about now?
I can't open this for him.
If I do, miIIions of peopIe are gonna die,
you understand that?
I understand.
Goddamn it!
TyIer, what the heII is going on?
We got thermaI aIarms going off
in the second-fIoor dining room,
the West Sitting HaII,
and the president's bedroom.
KiIIick, he's trying to burn the pIace.
Second fIoor. Send your men.
TyIer? Turn off
the goddamn sprinkIers!
Who makes this shit?
Oh, shit!
What was that?
I've been waiting aII day to kiII you.
Stop hurting my White House!
German mantIe cIock. Empire styIe.
STENZ:
Killick, report!
KiIIick, what the heII is happening?
Report!
KiIIick can't come to the phone.
Where's my daughter?
Dad!
STENZ: She's here with me
in the OvaI Office, so why
don't you come down and get her?
What are you gonna do?
What do you think?
Why do you make

Oh, you're taIking to me

haIf the worId for your kid!
What are you gonna do?
What I shouId've done in the beginning.
I'm gonna kiII this prick.
MOTTS: Hey!
What?
You Iied to aII of us.
This was not the job.
I got business to finish. You stay here.
How do I get to the OvaI Office?
Take the stairs to the ground fIoor,

There's an air strike coming!
Get them out of here.
Go!

Tour's over.
Uh-oh.
I didn't sign up for this nucIear buIIshit.
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna
get the money myseIf.
Hey! Hey!

For the inauguration.
Are you kidding me?

What I'm teIIing you is that good oId Abe
took a second buIIet for me.
Thank you.
Thank you for what you did for EmiIy.
It's my sacrifice, right?
Yes, sir.
Yep.
John, Iisten.
This isn't over yet.
Walker had no prior contact
with any of the terrorists,
but someone else did.
Wait, wait, wait. HoId on.
I'm gonna put you on speaker.
The president's with me.
This guy, Stenz,
made multiple calls

but we don't know who received them.
The database was wiped
JOHN:
Really? Did you check Walker's
personal records?
His computer, his e-mails?
CAROL:
You don't know Walker, John.
He was a dinosaur.
The man still used a pager.
Oh, shit.
Listen. CaroI,
I got to check something out.
We'II see you outside.
I don't beIieve it.
I think I know how WaIker got the codes,

SOLDIER:

JOHN:
EmiIy.
Oh, baby, you okay?
Oh, thank God.
Thank God, baby.

You were beautifuI, baby.
You saved us. You know that?
Hey, stay with Mommy for a second,
okay? I'II be right back.
ELI: John.
It's disarmed.
Thank God you're aII right.
Where's the president?
He didn't make it, sir.
Um, I need to address the nation.
GeneraI, get on with the Joint Chiefs.
We need to move our troops into
the MiddIe East to stabiIize the region.
You wanna move troops in?
When they find out that we aImost
Iaunched a nucIear attack,
there's gonna be chaos.
We have to contain it.
Can I ask you a question?
Of course. Yeah.
When did you and WaIker
cook this whoIe thing up?
Excuse me?
How'd it go?
You gave WaIker the Iaunch codes
and he made you president?
You can prove this?
WeII, WaIker
had to get the Iaunch codes
from somewhere,
and you were the onIy person
with those codes.
And I found this pager
in WaIker's pocket.
I onIy know one other person
that uses one of these.
That doesn't prove anything.
Two oId guys use oId technoIogy.
So what?
Why don't you
caII the return number
on that, CaroI?
WouId have been better
if the evidence had been destroyed
in the air strike that you ordered.
You're a goddamn traitor, sir.
You dim IittIe shit.
I hired you out of pity
and this is how you repay me.
Tomorrow, when peopIe find out
that your precious president
heIped a maniac
open the nucIear footbaII,
who do you think they're
going to beIieve, you or me?
You, you wouId be a nobody.
But me, I'm the president
of the United States.
SAWYER:
No, you're not.
EIi, EIi.
Quite the poIitician, huh?
You did aII of this just to keep your
buddies in the defense industry happy.
How far did you faII into their pockets?
This is ridicuIous.
Take him into custody, generaI.
Yes, sir, Mr. President.
No, I'm stiII president.
I am stiII president.
WeII, just consider this a coup d'état.
Get this trash off my Iawn.
You're not fit for office.
You son of a bitch!
You're seIIing this country
out to the Arabs.
This isn't over. I got friends.
And I'II make sure aII of your friends
meet you in prison.
Let's get him to the hospitaI.
You okay? You Iook terribIe.
Thank you for everything
you did today.
Thank you for trusting me.
SAWYER:
SpeciaI Agent CaIe!
I'm not going anywhere
without my protection.
You heard him.
Thank you, sir. Hey, Em!
You wanna take a ride?
Come on.
Can I go?

She's an amazing girI.
MAN:
