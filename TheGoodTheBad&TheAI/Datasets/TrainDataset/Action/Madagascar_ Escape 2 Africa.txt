Madagascar Escape 2 Africa.-DUQA
Well done boys.
It looks like ice cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no son. Over here.
See the lion, look at  the lion, you get the lion.
Now son, if you are going to grow up and be like your daddy someday
you got to learn how to fight.
Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same and when you're bigger,
you are gonna be alpha lion just like your daddy.
Now, let me see you fight. Ready?
No Alakay, no dancing.
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You are a strange kid. You are a strange man.
Oh come on, let's try it again.
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up
the way you want it to.
Oh come on.
You are not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side Zuba. After I...
...defeat you and take over as alpha lion,
you will have so much more time
to spend with your pathetic excuse of a son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you,
why do you even want to become the alpha lion?
I am better looking, I have better hair,
I am deceivingly smart and...
I want everyone else to do what I say.
We'll fight on three.
One.
Pay attention Alakay.
Daddy gonna show you how it's done.
Two, three.
Who is alpha lion?
You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that Alakay is how you attack.
Alakay?
That's it. Here kitty kitty.
Ah, this one is a beauty.
It will be worth a few bucks.
It just gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay, Alakay, Alakay!
Daddy!
No, no, no!
Alakay!
Daddy!
Alakay! Daddy got you, hold on.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Daddy!
Madagascar Escape 2 Africa.-DUQA
I don't like looks of this guy.
Well, I think he is kind of cute.
I think he is kind of show off.
You think he is cute?
The king of New York City.
Alex the lion!
I still think he is kind of a show off.
You got to give it to him, the guy is an animal.
Maybe you should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Come on. Where on earth would we go on vacation.
I don't know about you but I wanna go to Connecticut.
On the loose,
several animals including the world famous Alex
the lion the king of New York...
...escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were finally cornered
in Grand Central Station.
It was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists who convinced zoo officials
to have the escaped animals sent to Africa...
...were stunned to learn that
the shipping freighter carrying the animals
was reported missing today.
Tonight hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered
at the Central Park Zoo
to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind:
where are they now.
I like to move it, move it!
He likes to move it, move it!
She likes to move it, move it!
We like to?
Move it!
We are gonna miss you little fuzz buckets.
You guys had been a great crowd.
Glad we can introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come to look at Central Manhattan,
feel free to call first.
Seriously no, call. OK?
Settle down, settle down everybody. Ssh... Be quite.
You can't leave without this.
Hey. Surprise freaks!
Look. Shake it, shake it.
Yeah, I am a lady, I am a lady everyone.
I am a lady.
Not really, it's me, it's King Julien.
Which of you was attracted to me?
Hands up.
Hey freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh no, thank you.
Yes thank you. It's my plane.
Until I return with the spoils from the new country...
...Stevie will be in charge.
I don't think they liked that idea so much Julien.
What is that you are saying Stevie?
Oh, oh, no!
What? Really? No, you didn't say that.
Oh it's not even possible.
Stevie says:
Let them eat the cake!
King Julien wait for me.
I'm all packed.
I have such a whole itinerary plan.
Oh no. It's Mort. He's so annoying.
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing, he is carrying scissors and hand cream.
Everybody in quickly. Get in. Get in.
Get in quick. Get in quick.
Struts. Checked. Fillets. Checked.
Engine. Checked. Coffee mate. Checked.
Oopsie daisy.
That is got to be the second biggest slingshot I have ever seen.
But it is got to have to do.
Attention. This is your captain speaking.
In the event of a water emergency,
place the vest over your head then kiss your life good bye!
New York City, here we come baby.
...sit back, relax and pray your personal gods that...
...this hunk of junk flies.
Personal god, hunk, what?
We are going sir.
Open the door. I am outside.
In case of losing cabin pressure,
please place the mask over your face
to hide your terrified expressions from the other passengers.
Excuse me miss.
But aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat.
No sir.
OK. boys. Launch.
Launch.
Launch.
Launch.
Melman!
Hey, Mort.
Hi.
That was weird.
Hey, somebody is dreaming ha?
I think I just saw Mort on the wing of the plane.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
... it was quite a, it was incredible, wasn't it?
I think we will see much more fun
the further way we get from.
Yeah, like when you beat me on the butt?
I am gonna take that, that thing you are holding on to...
...and I am going to use it, on stage.
So all part of my little actor's salad bar
of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the crutons at the salad bar?
You don't need to be sarcastic Marty.
Hey guys, you know, I was thinking.
When we get back,
I might assign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
I think we all reach a point on our lives
when we wanna meet somebody,
you know settle down, have a relationship.
I see that.
What? Like, like dating?
Yeah, dating!
Other, other...
Other guys?
What do you mean "other guys"?
Darn it!
I'm gonna, what is holding up that beverage service.
I'm gonna go and check.
Oh, yeah ya, keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few wings.
Did you see that?
It is so funny.
I like laughing.
It is such a nice experience. To laugh.
Do you mind going back? This is first class.
It's nothing personal, it's just that we are better than you.
Hey Maurice. I'm awful, hit me, hit me.
Is it Vivaldi?
Hey, in flight slave.
Can I help you Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring me my nuts, on a silver plate.
We just wanted to check on the drinks we ordered.
Oh, sorry. We are in a little backed up.
Then I guess I am gonna back to..
Hey, what happened to your body?
You are freaking me out.
And can you please go over there please.
Thank you very much.
Whatever happened to the separation of the classes.
Yeah, I am sure is all democracy thing is just affeered.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
It looks like a small incandescent bulb
designed to indicate something out of the ordinary.
Like a malfunction.
I found it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too sir.
Right. Rico, manual.
Problemo solved.
Sir, we may be out of fuel.
What makes you think that?
We lost engine one.
And engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up boys.
Don't look dull. This might get hairy.
Attention. This is your captain speaking.
I've got good news and bad news.
The good news is, we will be landing immediately.
The bad news is,
we are crush landing!
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice what so ever.
But thanks again for choosing air penguin.
Raise your arms Maurice.
It's more fun when you raise your arms like this.
I can fly.
This could be it Marty.
I just want you to know that
you are truly a one in a million friend.
Thanks buddy. You are the best ever.
I know you won't mind when I tell you...
Come on. Tell me it, tell me, tell me what?
I broke your iPod!
What!
The button were so small. It made me mad.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna kill you!
I love you Gloria,
I always have!
Like ah...
Like you love the beach or a good book.
Or the beach.
My goodness doll,
you are shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you had your fun.
Haul up!
Gear down.
Gently now. You just wanna kiss the ground.
Just a little pack, smooch like a kiss...
I said kiss it!
Now, just a little break.
Just a touch, a little whisper.
I believe that's checkmate.
Immersed emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up! Deploy!
Oh, we are here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
OK. I'm OK. OK. I'm alive.
See, I can't even sleep for a minute.
You know what, this is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Only two passengers unaccounted for, Skipper.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly.
Hey, happy slappers.
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane.
We'll fix it.
Fix it? How you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lotta duct tape.
We should be up and running in say,
six to nine months.
Sixty nine months?
No! Six to nine months.
Kowalski,  I say we use this setback to our advantage.
Where do you get,
where do you pull that number out of, huh?
I want you to reconfigure the design, so start reconfiguring!
Great, that's a great... How do you estimate that?
You! Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a tree, maybe find water.
Hold on, hold on a second.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me.
Fine, you can be in charge. You fix the plane!
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK then, I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, that's right. You will remain in charge.
You and your little happy friends can stay out of our hair.
Correctamundo! Because I decided to.
Good for you.
Yeah, well guess what this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals, you stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and apposable thumbs.
Feel crushed
wash your hands out with soap.
How, in the.. Hello! are they gonna fix this plane?
You know, grit 'n spit and spit, once spit and griten.
Stick to it at mist.
They don't sound too promising.
You're right. Right, we are stuck here.
Hey guys, as long as we're together we'll be OK.
Yeah, yeah but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold, the lion!
Hey, it's people.
OK. There is much to see, moving on.
People.
Wait, wait.
Wait people.
Hey wait, if you stop we'll autograph those.
I know you.
You.
It's that bad kitty.
How do you like some other?
Right in the batteries!
You think that old lady can't take care of you?
Next time I won't go so easy on you.
Thank you dear.
Moving on.
Are you out of your mind?
We need their help, and you're arresting little old ladies?
Out of my mind? Aha!
Who is out of my mind?
See if you can get an operator?
No problem.
Out of my mind?
We're going home.
Message A-4: the service user has brought outside
of the coverage area. Please try again later.
Oh my.. Wow...
Am I trappen?
All those zebras, like me.
Wait a minute, where are we?
San Diego.
This time I'm forty percent sure.
I know this place.
I think this is Africa.
Africa?
It's gotto be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood. I can feel it.
No, no. It's more than that.
It's like dejavu.
Like I've, like I've been here before.
It's like roots.
No, no. It's like dejavu.
Like I've, like I've been here before.
How? How?
Me, Alex. Me and me friends. Fly. Fly.
In great metal bird.
Then. Plummet.
Smash ground. Go boom.
Then here. We emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash.
Yeah, we just... Yeah. I thought. Sorry.
You mean, you came from off the reserve.
Yeah, way off, from the Central Park Zoo actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What is going on here, what is all this have about?
They say they are from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar, do I know you from...
How could you possibly survived the hunters.
Hunters, we didn't see any hunters.
What are you looking at?
Me? Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So just get out of back to wherever you came from.
OK. Was there a maybe like a manager we can talk to?
Oh, I see.
You're here to challenge me.
What? No! No, no.
What else would start you look on to me?
Hold on, Zuba, wait.
Don't call woman, don't you see I am trying...
Yeah, yeah...
Zuba. Hold on.
Alakay, is that you?
No, it's Alex. "X",  like New York Knicks.
- Zuba, look.
Oh, I have always had that, have had checked it out,
it's really...
it's kind of a beauty spot, really.
Mark.
Alright, this is a little weird.
Honey, he has come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and dad.
Mom and dad. Mom and dad.
It's my mom and dad.
I've got a mom and dad.
My baby is alive.
My son.
My son is home.
Alakay, yeah. The pathetical son returns.
This is perfect.
I thought you hated Zuba.
No I do. I do, I do. I hate him. Oh, I do.
And I am going to use Alakay.
Yes. I am going to use him
to get rid of Zuba once and for all.
Move out of the way, stand aside.
New York. Hmm, it's a bit of a dumb.
Are you sure we are not in New Jersey?
Hello New Yorkers, your new king is here.
This calls for celebration.
Maurice, I think they like me.
You got to love a known house to take off.
Chaka chaka what?
Excuse me, excuse me.
I'm Marty. I'm kind of new around here.
Hey Marty.
Hey, you are a good looking group.
You like to run?
Oh yeah. Running is crackalacking.
That's right, that's right, crackalacking.
You guys are speaking my crackalacking language.
What, you don't have doctors here?
Well, not any more.
What if you catch a cold?
We go over to the die holes and we die.
OK, you guys really need a doctor.
Hey, we have an opening.
Would you be interested?
Me? A doctor?
It's raining men, hallelujah.
You are gotto going all.
How come you don't have a man in your life.
Listen girls, Manhattan is short on two things:
parking and hippos.
Hey everybody! I just found out that
my son is a king.
The king of New York.
Show me some of your moves son. Come on.
Don't be bashful.
Alright.
Ooh, this one always knocks them dead.
The king is mad, the king is mad.
Now, let's all welcome him back into the pride
above the arms.
Welcome to the herd Marty.
Me, in a herd?
I've always wanted to be a part of a herd.
It's one for all,
and all for all.
How do I look?
Technicly, a traditional witch doctor has a bone to his nose.
Don't worry, it has just a clip on it.
Voila, he's a witch doctor.
My mother would be so happy.
Look out. I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big.
I like 'em chunky.
I like 'em big.
I like 'em plumpy.
I like 'em round.
With something, something.
They like my sound.
They think I'm funky.
Goodness girl.
You're huge.
Who is your friend,
or is that your butt?
Girl, you are as quick as you all have to.
So, you are Moto Moto.
The name is so nice,
when you say it twice.
I kind of a like it that so.
I see you around new.
I won't be hard, because you're so plumpy.
Oops. I hate to be a party pooper Zuba
but some of the other lions are wondering
when you are going to banish your son.
What are you talking about, Makunga?
It's nothing really,
if their great being about who Alakay
never went through the rite of passage, bla bla bla...
So, technically speaking...
...he can't be a member of the pride,
it's nonsense.
I had forgotten about the rite of passage.
What is it? What is this rite of passage?
It's a traditional common of a ceremony where
young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
Sort of a show skill, talent show, tab dale?
Yeah, sturdiness stuff.
Great informers. I think that's up my alley guys.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Stud my stuff. Earn my mane.
I want to be Alakuy.
Alakay.
Alakay. Even better.
We'll hold the rite of passage first thing in the morning.
That's wonderful. Good luck Alakay.
Where I come from we say: Break a leg.
Oh, that's my boy.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah.
It's amazing.
Guys, this is where we belong.
Operation tourist trap is in go.
Oh, I like that one.
That's a good one.
That works on many levels sir.
You guys are a bunch of suck ups.
That too sir.
Absolutely.
Hide.
Stations.
Stage one. Go.
Oh no. What've I done.
Come on, take the bait.
Stage two. Go, go, go.
I'll  give him the kiss of life.
Rico.
Rico!
Reverse.
Gas.
Music.
Oh no, stop. Stop.
Stop. Come back.
What is all that rock'n roll racket?
Is she dead?
No!
You hood ones!
Good heavens. Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocket bag.
Oh, my hand bag. Such a good boy.
Man, I can't survive without it.
Wow, you are a one tough cookie.
Brownies, root for sixteen. Yonkers.
OK. Nobody panic. The best thing we can do is
stay together. We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours and it's getting dark but...
Where are you going?
I'm not gonna stay out in the opening
get attacked by more animals.
I'm too old to die.
I don't know about you guys
but I'm going with her.
Please! We need to stay...
together.
Fine, we'll go that way.
Does anyone want a hot candy?
Easy now.
Watch your step. And this, right here.
OK. Are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh man!
Was this mine?
Look at you. Look at him honey.
Oh my.
Oh this thing. Look, look. I remember this.
You remember.
Harder than I...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Was that, was that my?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little bit of paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow. I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault. I turned my back for a minute and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally I had to assume that the hunters... Well...
We thought, we thought they killed you.
But my son fought those hunters off ha?
Don't mess with the king of New York.
That's right.
Alright, alright boys. Be careful.
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this Fufi.
Fufi?
Fufi.
Oh, he doesn't want that thing.
Give my Fufi.
Zuba, you'd better give him his Fufi.
I mean no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Well son, you get your rest,
you'll have a big day tomorrow.
You're gonna need all your strength.
I'm gonna bring the house down for you dad.
I hope so,
otherwise your father would have to banish you.
Oh gee, not really?
I know you're gonna do us proud. You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night Alakay.
My boy, my own boy.
My son is a king.
My son is a king.
Good night mom.
Good night Alakay.
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Hey Nana, do you even know where you are going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, alright.
It's people. Where do you come from?
How could we get out of here?
Can you help us, we're lost?
We are lost too.
It was awful, a flash of black and white never gone.
They took the jeep, everything.
That happened to our jeep too.
What are we gonna do?
Only hope to survive out here!
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
You can let nature get the best of you,
or you can get the best of nature.
Gather around children.
We are New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survived in a concrete jungle.
If we need food, we hunt for a decent hotdogs stand,
am I right?
She is right.
If we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
If we need water, we build a dam.
Come on, we're New Yorkers.
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere.
I'm coming King Julien.
Skipper, we have all the parts we need
but we're slightly behind schedule.
How slightly?
Six to nine years.
Sixty nine years?
No six to nine years.
Privates, what happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday sir. Damn you...
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private, you are coming with me.
Rico, you are coming with me.
I'm tracking down to bring them for the court marshall.
That won't be necessary.
We have recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Floppy of monkeys entered.
I doubt that.
Enough wallin' gagging now let's get to work. We'll divide into three groups.
Group alpha, you are charged in seeping of fabrication.
Group Offset, you'll handle assembly.
Group George Report: you'll handle gas services.
Any questions?
Good, then let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you monkey man.
Alright but you are so darn ugly.
Alright, so little cubs cats, just remember
great dance performance comes from the heart.
Just comes straight from your heart and you never go wrong.
Sure Mr.
Hey Alakay, I just happened to walk by and wanted to wish luck.
You're not nervous, are you?
No, it's my thing. You know.
It's kind of what I do.
In my opinion; the key of this whole thing
is choosing the right competitor.
Oh, you mean this is like a dance battle, sort of thing?
Like a dance off?
Sure.
Great, I loved that. Freestyle, put your moves out.
Who do you thing would be a good match for me?
You know, just to keep the things interesting.
Well...
I wish I could help, but that's strictly against to our ancient tradition and although we hold secret but
If I was me out there, I'd choose Titsy.
Titsy, OK?
Sounds interesting. Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go, get him tight.
Shake it out.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
Come on baby, make mama proud.
Oh woman, I'm trying to take care of passage here.
Got it mom.
So who will be the first participant?
Me, me me...
How about you, the tall, handsome one?
Right there, yeah. Choose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick...
...Titsy.
Titsy? Why did he pick Titsy?
Oh, that's my boy, he got some gumption there.
Somebody wake him up, wake him up.
Alright, so Titsy. Come on. Let's do this ha?
Come on Titsy fly, Titsy fly, come on let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
Let's dance.
OK. But it's only fair to warn you
that I'm a prodigy of fupsy and robbins.
Not dance dance, fight.
Oh, dance fight. You got it.
Is he dancing?
What is he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around.
No no pap, it's hop shuffle ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh no.
Alakay.
Are you hurt?
Oh yeah, I'm.
Did I, did I win?
Oh no son, how could, I mean how could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
And a king does not get beat.
Well, I'm a king.
I'm a king in New York.
It's my stage name.
I'm like a, you know, It's for what I perform.
Perform?
No, this is horrible. Alakay has failed the test.
Who would have ever imagine that the day Zuba would have to banish...
...his own son.
- Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then, I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad no, you can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone? Someone?
No one?
Hey.
You sir. I guess not.
Well I, this is all very awkward, but I suppose,
I could carry this tremendous burden.
Titsy, get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay...
...he shell wear this hat of shame
and leave the watering hole.
For a thousand years or life...
...whichever comes last.
Come on. Shoo shoo.
Get out of here.
You should have told us son.
You should have told us that you weren't a real king.
You never told me that I have to fight anybody.
What did you expect son?
I don't know, maybe a fatherly advice,
like: hey son...
...it's a fight.
You are a lion, aren't you?
But I never fought another lion in my life.
Yeah, yes, right. You dance.
And other stuff. The point is, your pal, Makunga...
...set me up back there. I mean, none of these would happen...
If you were a real lion...
Zuba.
Yeah, I said it.
A real lion?
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw, stitcher.
Swallow.
You're in my light Steaven.
Oh, say. You've got a brown spot there on your shoulder.
Yeah, that's very observative of you Steven.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK. That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So, I don't have to pick another dying hole?
No, Timo. You've got your whole life ahead of you.
Really?
Go out there and grab a bite of that horns.
Thank you doctor Mankiewicz.
Break a leg. Sweet kid.
This spot looks like witch doctor's disease.
Witch doctor's disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease, I've ever heard of, Steven.
Wow...
Don't ask.
Someone has been naughty.
OK. This one will hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, he had a spot just like that.
Monday Joe, Wednesday no Joe.
Wednesday no Joe?
I can breathe.
Thanks doc.
So, this witch doctor's disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure. Hey, you got at least forty eight hours.
But I have never even heard of it.
What? I mean, I don't have any penicillin.
I'm gonna need a catscan just to get started.
You'll have a lion looking over, they'd be happy to.
Ta daaa.
That guy has got talent.
Bet you haven't seen that one before.
This knock 'em dead in New York.
Hey, let's all give it a try.
Yeah, let's do it.
Well, hey hey hey, I know you want to
but it's gonna take years of practice...
...you get never gonna quite get a tight stream
until you build up your lip muscles to the point...
...where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta daa...
How did you?
You guys got it right up the box.
If you can do it.
We can do it.
It's in our blood.
I always thought, I was a little bit unique.
We are unique.
Hey, we are like a force of nature.
A million points of light.
And all stripes.
Exactly the same.
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive Kowalski,
but will it fly?
Yes, if we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh man, my dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I have ruined my parent's lifes.
That is definitely not crackalacking.
It's lacking in the craken my friend.
I have got to fix this.
So,
there is...
...there is something I gotto tell you.
Hey guys.
Is this place great or what?
I'd go with or what.
Oh well, I tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it but;
I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who is Moto Moto.
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big.
You know what Moto Moto means?
Twins?
It means hot hot.
Hot hot?
OK, when did you start parley in African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry.
You can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
What's the deal Melman?
Why am I the parade and you are the rain?
Why do you have to dry the parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll just parade myself in another part of town.
Fine by me. By the way, the main streets mine.
Well, you can have your old stinking main streets.
And you can take your hottie tub flood
and you Mr. hot, Moto Moto Jr. comes...
My hottie tub what? What are you talking about?
Come on Melman, why don't you just tell her?
You tell, what? Tell her, what are you talking about?
I don't know what you are talking about.
So I guess, I'll go then.
You know what, don't bother.
Don't get up in my account.
Melman, Gloria.
Hey, I thought you guys were friends.
Come on guys, Marty is absolutely right.
Marty?
Marty?
Marty!
What the heck is going on?
You are not ooh.. He was no! I thought he...
You are not him. He is ooh...
You thought that guy was me?
No, no, no. I mean yes, yes.
You do guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys do kind of look a little a lot you look a lot alike.
Marty you look a lot alike, come on.
You laugh alike, you talk alike, he has the same sort of speech pattern...
I mean that is a little weird.
Really, you two guys are, come on Marty.
So you're saying there is nothing unique about me,
I am just like any other zebra.
No, of course you are different.
How?
How?
OK. I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something. I don't know.
A bell?
OK. not a bell, no bell is a bad idea.
No, no, no.
How about a t-shirt that says: "I'm with stupid."?
I am not stupid.
Not you stupid, him stupid!
You know what? While you have been off doing
prancing pony with the new pussy.
I have been having pretty much the worst day of my life, OK?
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours Marty.
All right, I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
Yeah fine, run away Marty! Run away.
That's what you do best, just like back in New York!
I'm right here. But you can't tell that right?
Your one in a million friend hopes you enjoy your
bigger than everyone else's problems, alone!
Good, leave! I don't need you to help me solve my problems.
You know what? You diame dust I can't tell which one is Marty.
Oh, which one is Marty? Wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah!
I don't care.
Nice hat, you show off!
Marty...
...don't go.
Look Maurice. Here is the perfect spot for my semi-palace,
so please fill in all these holes and relocate the roofed.
Oh, who'd leave a perfectly good head lying around.
What a waste.
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know.
Probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bomber man.
Oh, if I King Julien, that's my name.
Only had two days left to live.
I'd do all the things I have ever dreamed of doing.
Like what?
I'd love to became a professional whistler.
I pretty amazing that I did know.
But I wanna get luck even better.
I'd make my living out of it.
You know what else I'd do?
I'd invade a neighboring country and impose...
...my own ideology even if they didn't want it.
It's easy for you to say, you are a king.
Yes. And you are only just a sad little head.
But there must be something
you want to do before you die.
Well...
There is this one thing.
What is it? Tell me.
Well. No, I couldn't. I mean.
What is it?
You know, I just never really have the guts to tell Gloria,
how I think about her.
What is it?
I don't really have the guts to tell Gloria,
how I feel about her.
What is it?
I have always felt about her.
Fine, don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
Oh, you didn't tell me we are talking about a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You are dead man anyway, come on.
Yeah?
Yeah...
Yeah, you are right.
Well, you gotta march right up to this woman, right?
You look her right in the eye, you lean forward, right?
Just a little, almost all the way.
Then you let her, like, lean forward, just a little bit until you're...
...just a lips distance away from each other.
And then you just tell her,
how much you hate her.
Actually, it's, it's more like love her.
Oh, you slave dog.
You're a real player, you know that?
Now listen to me.
You gotto raise up.
I can't hear you.
Yeah.
Good. You gotto raise up.
You gotto get out of the hole.
I'm raising up on the ground.
He's raising Maurice.
I'm raising Maurice.
You gotto go right up to this woman.
Yeah.
You gotto go right up to a fight.
Yeah, I tell her.
And then you gotto say: Baby, I dig you. Yeah.
Yeah. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.
I love that happy little head.
She loves me.
She loves my eyes.
She loves me.
She loves my ass.
She loves my roundness.
She loves that I'm chunky.
She loves that I'm plumpy.
She loves my healthiness.
She loves my zestiness.
She loves me restlessly.
She loves me forever.
She loves me, because she loves me.
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well...
...I was wondering if I were to for example stay here...
...I'd like to ask you
Let your candy lips bring the messages to my ear canal.
Well I don't know, I have so many questions.
Well I promise, the answer will always be yes...
...unless, no is required.
OK. So, what is it about me that you find so interesting?
Oh, you're the most plumpiness girl I've ever met.
OK. Other than that?
Let's see, you, you know, you are chunky.
Right.
Oh, my gosh girl you are huge.
You've said that.
Oh, yes right. We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria?
Melman?
Melman, I want you to meet with Moto Moto.
Ah, Moto Moto. Yeah.
Nice to, nice to meet you.
Well, I guess, I...
It's OK. Melman. Apology accepted.
Oh, yeah, right, yes. That, yes, that's why I... Good.
Oh, OK. That's well, that's it then.
You good, we're kind of a busy here man.
No! No, that's not it!
Listen Mototo, you'd better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I would give her flowers every day. And not just any flowers, OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed. Six loaves of wheat toast with butter on both sides.
No crusts. The way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend...
... and I'd spend every day trying to think of how to make her laugh.
She has the most...
...most amazing laugh.
Well, I mean. That's what I would do, if I were you.
But I'm not. So you do it.
Oh, OK. What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm huge.
Surprised to see me Makunga?
Well I'm here to set things straight.
Like a real lion.
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up.
This is for stealing my dad's job.
This is for humiliating my family.
And making me fun like a fool.
Had enough? Sure fly away. Coward.
The water, it's gone.
Oh no.
The watering hole has never gone dry before.
We're gonna need a lot more dying holes.
How could this happen?
Out of my way.
What is going on here?
The watering hole is dried up, there's barely enough water for one of us.
Yes, good observation Shirley.
I'm Boby.
Makunga what will we do?
Quiet!
Listen up. I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis.
We'll all have to fight for it.
Fight for it? This is crazy.
That's not fair, you'd win.
Exactly Shirley.
I'm Boby.
Sorry folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now.
Thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please Makunga this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
I left the reserve and survived.
I could do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe. But we get in New York all the time.
I'll just travel up river.
Up river?
Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah me. I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great I'll help you pack but by the looks of that hat I see you're all set.
Yeah fine. Go ahead laugh. Laugh your mane off.
I'm gonna prove you're wrong.
May be you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
Where is Zuba? You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
Alright, fine. As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba.
Marty?
Marty?
Is Marty here?
Marty, I apologize to you.
I did wrong.
I'm sorry. I overlooked your problems.
At that moment I realized that I was wrong, actually.
What kind of a friend does that make me?
Pretty lousy friend I guess.
Well I just want you to know that...
...you're one in a million.
Isn't this touching?
This is touching.
So could you please turn around so I can tell you that to your face?
That's right. Got you.
I see you in there. Yeah yeah you.
That's right you, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
I see you Marty.
I know it's you.
You know what makes you special?
These guys...
They're white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer Marty. Always have been.
You have a great taste in music and
horrible taste in friends.
Not Melman and Gloria, me.
OK. I'm in.
No Marty. You can't come with me.
I don't believe you have a choice.
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
OK. Don't give up hope.
Listen up. I'll help you.
There is only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien, must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends, water gods.
In the volcano.
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes into volcano.
Then the friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
Mmm.. Very nice. Thank you for the sacrifice.
Please have another sacrifice.
No, I've had enough for the day.
Listen, I'm gonna be very unsettled unless you will have another...
I don't want another sacrifice, OK?
Look at you, you look skinny.
No, I think I've had enough, is that clear?
The gods eat the sacrifice, they are grateful, they give me some of their water.
Then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No. I mean yes.
Well, Maurice?
Yeah, it's fifty fifty.
Excellent.
Now, all I  need is someone who'd like to go in the volcano
and get eaten by gods.
Any hands? Hands? Anybody?
OK. I need someone, perhaps who has never fall in love.
Who could look death, straight in the eye ball.
A real genuine hero.
I'll do it.
Melman?
Hurry up. Before you all come to your senses.
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyways.
If there is a chance, it'll get you water, it'll be worthy.
Are you nuts?
Gloria, I just want you to know, back at the zoo,
it was never the doctors or the prescriptions that kept me going...
...it was always you. Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman, wait.
You gonna mop around like this all day?
Don't hmph me. Listen Zuba. A miracle happened.
Our son has come back to us.
How come, that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying woman?
We've lost him once Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
Zuba.
Get out of here.
What do you want Makunga?
It's awful. The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible.
There is nothing left.
Well, you are the alpha lion Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay. He said he could fix it.
He has gone up river.
Off the reserve?
No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide but he was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here in case he comes back.
Hurry Zuba.
I'm so parched.
Is this place, aren't affright you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters'll never know we were here.
Why are "we" doing this?
Look, Marty maybe my dad'll think that I'm...
I just wanna show him, I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this might sound hard to believe,
but apparently lions don't dance.
What?
As far as my dad's concerned.
As far as the people is concerned, you're a huge hit.
That was New York. This is Africa.
It's a much tougher crowd.
Marty, Marty.
This's it.
This is the clog.
Come on.
Here's the water.
Marty, stay down.
Look at that.
It's her.
Is this right?
Oh, very good.
We need dynamite, do you have any dynamite?
Oh, snap, I just used my last...
Alex!
Run Marty.
Come on, I can't leave you here.
Go, get help.
OK. OK. OK...
OK. Here we go. OK...
Here we go. Here we go.
What is all the hoop about?
Joe?
Joe, the witch doctor? We thought you were dead.
So did I. Then I realized, I'm covered in brown spots.
So, Melman's not dying.
Melman's not dying.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Melman!
Move out. Don't do this.
Julien, stop this. This's crazy!
Oh, certainly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy.
Yes!
Please, Melman stop.
Gloria?
You can't do this.
Why not?
Because I...
You can't do this Melman.
First of all, it hurts.
Second of all, I'll only have eighteen hours to live anyway.
Melman, I gotto know.
Did you really mean all those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
This is crazy.
It is?
It's crazy in the thing, I had to go half way around the world...
...to find out that the perfect guy for me...
...lived right next door.
Then I guess it's you and me neighbor...
...you and me for the next eighteen hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
Maurice, what just happened?
I believe the fat lady has sobbed.
Hey, what's going on here?
Marty.
Hey, listen up. Alex is in big trouble. We get to get up the river fast.
What about the plane?
Perfect. Come on.
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, about maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're males.
Look, we need a plane for rescue mission.
Well, there is nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'm gonna get the busty not bully you if you don't get this plane going.
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied here?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savannah.
Alright, you get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where are you headed?
What's going on? Where are we going?
Oh no, please. You are not gonna burn me there.
No, no, no.
This's wrong.
You see? You are survivals.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
We can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, taste like chicken.
No, no, no, no. Don't listen to her.
She is out of her mind. People.
I'm from New York City too.
It's me, Alex the lion. From Central Park.
Dad.
What were you thinking son?
You got no matter be not here.
This's it, I want you to stay behind.
Look dad, they're New Yorkers, they are just...
...ruined and frightened people.
Stay back.
Are you gonna let them get away?
What are you doing son?
The only thing I know how to do.
Hey, all those moves...
Alex?
This is Alex the lion.
From Central Park.
This is Alex.
Only one lion can move like that.
This is beautiful.
I can't believe this.
How does he do that?
Dad, what are you doing?
Dancing with my son...
...I think.
Don't think dad, feel.
Butterfly.
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
Oh, that was beautiful.
Now, let's eat.
Dad, look out!
What the?
Alex, get in.
She has got a gun.
Let's get out while we can.
What?
She has got a gun. Let's get out while we can.
Pass it on.
He said, let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Pass it on.
Skipper, Alex wants to take out the dam.
Alright, but it's his funeral.
What?
Deploy.
Aye aye, Skippy.
Come back. That's my dinner.
Kovalski, full proto.
Music.
Oh, I like this song.
It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Tell them, no, pull up. She will kill us.
There is gotto be another way. Pass it on.
They say, no pull up, kill us. There is no other way. Pass it on.
Are you sure?
There is no sacrifice greater then someone else.
No, medic!
Relic speed.
Bring it on.
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seem so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano...
...if I wasn't so good at whistling.
Oh, it's you. I found you.
Mort?
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's go find out.
Look, Maurice.
That was quick.
I did it. I did it. I did it.
OK. You did it.
Oh yes.
Look.
It's Alakay, it's Zuba.
Zuba, Alakay.
You're back.
I'm so glad you're safe.
Out of my way.
Well, well, well, well, well.
You know Zuba, if I remember correctly,
you quitted the pride, and you were kicked out.
So don't think for any instant that this changes anything.
You're right, in fact we humbly
present you with this token of appreciation.
That is a man bag, very popular where I came from.
I don't know what to say.
You can still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does this strip adjust?
Yes. I think this will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But I'm afraid you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My hand bag.
You bad kitty.
You deserve this son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks dad. But this belongs to you.
No, no son, to us.
My son, the king of New York!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better please.
What a beautiful weird couple.
That's not gonna last.
Can I kiss the bride Skipper?
No.
Music.
Struts? Checked.
Fillets? Checked.
Diamonds and gold? Checked.
Bye bye.
We're gonna miss you.
See you later.
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo.
Or whenever the gold runs out.
Take cares.
Come back soon.
Hey you know mom, let them take their time.
New York is not going anywhere.
Right guys?
Yeah, you're right about that?
Well, as long as I'm with her.
And you two.
I don't care where we're.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries.
Well, it looks like you're stucked with us for a while.
Dad, what's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
You got me.
I got you son.
You got me with my... You did my thing.
You got a background on me. I love it.
I got you son.
Old man is not too bad, hey Marty?
Marty?
Who's Marty?
Come on?
I don't know Marty. Don't call me Marty.
You can't fool me.
I don't see no Marty. Ain't no Marty here.
Marty, I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
Hey shake the hot thing.
Shake the hot thing.
Shake 'em. Shake 'em.
Shake 'em. Shake 'em...
