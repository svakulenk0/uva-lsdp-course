RADIO ANNOUNCER:
Eckert has got to make up some ground
and try to get in field goal position.
But with the clock running down
and no time-outs left,
REFEREE:
- How did that one feel, bitch?
- Get off him!
Hey, man, you got rocked.
He hits hard!
Matty, be careful.
Eckert! Thirty seconds left.
Just get us in field goal range!
Come on, kid, now, execute!
Empty left! Empty left!
How's he doing?
Wolverines!
Your ass is mine, bitch!
You hitting on me, 53?
Mac 53, Mac 53. Hut!
Eckert, you got to stop
with the cowboy shit!
If I did that,
I'd still be back on the 20, Coach!
Get Danny on the corner!
Tell him to get his ass out of bounds!
- Line! Line!
- Pick him up. Pick him up.
Lead your team, 9!
COACH: - Take us to the house, Eckert!
- Hut!
You got to stop the clock!
Take it out of bounds!
STADIUM ANNOUNCER:
COACH: Field goal, Archer!
Coach, let me go for it!
You got to be kidding me!
Field goal! Come on!
Kitner, what the hell are you doing?
It's for the podcast for
the school website.
They allow cursing on that podcast?
No, sir.
Then get that shit out of my face!
STADIUM ANNOUNCER:
Thanks for coming out tonight, Wolverines.
We'll see you next time.
Hey, hey. It's my bad. My bad.
Hey, bitch! We're going to the finals,
you want a ticket?
Awesome! Glad I could help.
God damn it.
Ow!
Why are you hitting me?
Because it's more fun
than watching you stress.
Get out of your head.
Let's have a good time.
Sounds like a plan.
Ow.
When is this supposed to get fun for me?
- Soon.
- Soon?
Pussy.
Now you're in the Air Force, right?
Marines, actually.
Yeah? I got a cousin that joined.
Where are you stationed?
I was in Najaf.
Down in California?
Close. Iraq.
Can I have another beer, please?
I mean, what are we
even fighting for, you know?
Cheers.
Jed Eckert.
- Toni.
- Toni Walsh.
Our families...
Our families used to go camping
together, I remember.
And you were always the oldest,
so you'd end up babysitting.
I used to think of it more
as being a scout leader or something.
Or babysitting.
Or babysitting, maybe, yeah.
Oh, God, and your mom used to make us
sing the most ridiculous songs.
Shit. I'm sorry.
Nothing to be sorry about.
I know it was hard on you guys.
Yeah.
So, how long are you here for?
- A few weeks.
- Then what?
Then it's off to wherever
they want to send me next.
Hey, Toni!
- We're right here. Hi.
- Okay.
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.
You guys won't miss these, right?
- No, of course not.
- Not at all, Toni.
Hey, sweetie.
What's gotten into you?
- Matt, nice game.
- Yeah, wasn't it amazing?
- You out?
- Yeah, man, I'm out.
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
that the blackout may run
along the entire Northwest corridor.
Still no information on what may have
caused this massive failure, but...
- So, Matty.
- Yo!
You didn't tell me your brother was back
and all grown up.
Why are you so interested?
Because I'm an only child
and I'm curious about sibling rivalry.
I wish you had told us you were coming.
I still can't find the extra sheets
for the foldout. I've looked everywhere.
Dad, don't worry about it.
The couch is fine.
Love you.
I love you!
TONI: Love you.
MATT: Love you.
See you.
Hey, girls.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Got blackout duty.
Got to go rein in the crazies.
MATT: So, you saw the game?
Yes, sir, I saw it all.
I'm proud of you.
You played your hardest.
That's what matters.
They're lucky to have you.
Later.
You want a beer?
Hey, Matty, what are you doing?
I'm getting a drink.
Okay, you got a drink.
Close the door, the power's out.
Lighten up, man.
Hey, don't you have to
secure the perimeter or something?
A rendezvous with douche company?
What's going on?
Matty! We've got to find Dad. Come on.
I got no reception!
Try the radio.
Son of a bitch.
What is this?
I don't know.
Shit.
Hang on!
Stay on my ass!
Hang on!
Shit!
- Get to the cabin!
- What? No!
The cabin!
Jed, take care of your brother,
you hear me?
Get out of here while you still can.
Go now! Go!
- No!
- Come on!
Jed, go!
- Jed, we got to get Erica.
- Where?
Next right!
Hold on!
Pool!
Erica.
- Matt!
- Erica!
No, Matty!
Get off me!
Erica!
Matty!
Matt! Jed!
Come on! Come on!
Jump in!
Go, go, go!
No, no, no!
No, that's my son!
They're just boys, okay? They're just boys.
- What do we do?
MATT: - Just follow us!
Come on!
Oh, shit!
- Jed!
- I know, I see it.
Jed!
Shit.
Come on!
- Go!
- Yes.
Anyone hurt?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
We had to leave, okay?
I'm Pete.
They're from out of town.
San Diego or something.
They just saw their dad get killed.
Okay, listen.
I want you to take these guys
and see what you can find in there.
I'll get the generator going.
Jed, we got to find out what's going on.
My parents, what about my mom?
Robert, you're right. That's your job.
So, find a radio or TV
and get us reception. Get it working, okay?
- But Jed, we can't just stay here.
- Say yes, Robert.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hook it in there.
NEWS ANCHOR:
There.
- Is that it?
- No, no. Go back.
Freeze, freeze.
...no longer controlled
by the government of the United States.
Don't go outside
unless it's an absolute emergency.
Accidents are more likely to happen when
people move about unnecessarily.
Accidents?
If you've become separated from someone
and you don't know where they are,
Hey, what the hell, man?
Bullshit.
What does that mean?
It means we're screwed.
MATT: Hey!
Hey! Do you hear that?
Matty, kill the lights. Let's go!
What are you doing?
I'm going to draw them away
and hope like hell they take the bait.
I'll come with you.
No, you're gonna be cutting the lights
and keeping those assholes quiet.
- What if I cut the...
- Just do what I say.
Come on, Matty.
No!
Stop! Hold your fire.
- What did I tell you to do?
- It wasn't me.
You almost took my head off!
I thought they got past you.
You give me the gun.
I'm not giving you dick.
Who the hell put you in charge, anyway?
Okay, let's compromise.
What?
More?
Shit.
Give me that.
Danny.
Man!
Your dad said you were up here.
You saw him? Was he okay?
Yeah, but it's bad down there, man.
Where are our troops, Jed?
I don't know.
Toni.
You hurt?
No, I'm fine.
Fine.
Is Erica here?
I think they took her.
Everybody inside.
Wake up.
What's wrong?
That asshole Pete and his buddy
took off with all the food.
I need you guys
to take anything we can use,
put it in the truck and
hide it in the woods.
And that prick knows
where we are so keep your eyes open.
Matty, come with me. Let's go. Get up.
MATT: North Korea.
It doesn't make any sense.
JED: There's a bigger picture here.
They had to have had help.
You think it's like this everywhere?
I don't think they've come all this way
just for Spokane and Seattle.
MATT: Where do you think Dad is?
JED: Probably down there.
With anyone else they think is a threat
or they can get information from.
MATT: You think Erica is in there?
Your girl is a fighter.
She'll be okay.
MATT:
We can't just call 911, Matty.
We got to stay put for now and just pray
like hell it doesn't get any worse.
Hey!
Hey! They found us.
There's no one here.
I swear. This is where they were.
JED: Son of a bitch. It's Pete.
Holy shit. Daryl, that's your dad.
What? Let me see.
Quiet. Stay down.
Jesus Christ.
Captain Cho here is the acting prefect
of this district.
He says you seriously injured
some of his men
if you turn yourselves in,
no one is going to be hurt. Okay?
Guys, shouldn't we do what he says?
What do we do, Jed?
We don't move.
- But if my dad trusts this guy...
- Daryl, shut up.
Everybody stay still.
I want you to go to war
and stop this piece of shit.
Tom!
- No! No!
- Matty! Stay here!
They're going to find us.
Guys, what are we even doing up here?
We should just go back.
Matt, I'm sorry.
My parents are still down there.
I'm worried something's
going to happen to my dad.
Maybe he could help us.
He can't help us, Daryl.
He's helping them.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means he's helping them.
You saw him, he just stood there
and watched.
What else was he supposed to do?
Our dad made a choice.
And Daryl's dad's got to make one, too.
We all do.
We're going home.
Robert,
your parents aren't down there.
I saw it. I didn't know how to tell you.
We can't go home.
We can't keep running.
What are we supposed to do?
I'm going to fight.
I'm going to fight.
Now this is easier for me
because I'm used to it.
But the rest of you
are going to have a tougher choice.
Look, I don't want to sell it to you,
it's too ugly for that.
It's ugly, and it's hard.
But when you're fighting
in your own backyard,
and you're fighting for your family,
it all hurts a little less
and it makes a little more sense.
And for them, this is just some place.
But for us,
this is our home.
Obviously, we don't stand a chance
against these guys in a straight-up fight.
But if you look at the Viet Cong
or the Mujahideen,
Even the tiniest flea
can drive a big dog crazy.
So, the first thing we have to do
is learn how to work together.
That's gross.
But keeping your shit together
in a firefight is a whole different story.
There's almost half a million faces
down there and they can't track them all.
who can help us get the things
we need to fight back.
The more we know,
the easier it will be to hurt them.
These things are bad ass.
Not if you know anything.
We need to get better weapons.
WOMAN OVER PA:
where you and your family
can be taken care of.
Forty seconds.
The weapons and ammo, get it all.
Robert, you okay?
Yeah.
JED: Let's go.
JED: Come on, come on!
We've got what we need. Let's go!
DANNY: Holy shit!
Hey, Jed. Isn't this C4?
I can't. This is stupid.
Yes, you can. Come on, just sight it up.
Now, one shot, behind the shoulder.
Just relax.
Breathe out and squeeze.
Shit.
You got him.
What is this?
You drink the blood latte,
or the deer's spirit, or some shit?
It's not "some shit," Robert.
It's tradition, Robert.
Drink up.
Dude, it's not that bad actually.
No?
What did it taste like?
Well, you know.
- Hell, no, we don't.
- We never drank that shit.
That can't be safe!
JED: Okay, you guys ready?
How you feeling?
I don't know.
It's all right, man. I feel the same way.
Look, I know we're outnumbered
and we're out-gunned.
But that doesn't mean
we can't make a difference.
So it's up to us to let people know
that there is a fight on.
A fight that we need them to join.
Most of those soldiers down there,
they don't want to be here.
So we have to make it too hard,
and too difficult and too bloody
for them to stay.
When I was overseas,
we were the good guys. We enforced order.
Now we're the bad guys
and we create chaos.
WOMAN OVER PA:
where you and your family
can be taken care of.
Come on! Come on!
Move! Let's go!
Come on, let's go.
That's Captain Cho.
Let's go.
Okay, 15 seconds.
DANNY: Who are they?
Collaborators.
Had to happen.
Okay, here we go. Look alive.
Hey!
Hey, Pete!
The Wolverines!
It's the Wolverines...
Dude.
Dude!
Nobody move!
Sandwich artist! Fill this shit with bread!
- What kind?
- I don't care! Just no flat bread.
- Wheat! Honey oat!
- Tuna! Turkey!
Shit!
Did they see us?
I don't know. Just get the food.
Go! Get the food!
MAN ON RADIO:
Oh, my God, that was good.
I missed this.
You know what else I miss?
Pizza.
Toilets that flush.
Dude, we're living
And it sucks.
You guys are amateurs, man.
I miss girls.
No, not like you.
I mean like hot, sexy,
voluptuous girls.
Nice.
Girls without AKs.
Who needs AKs?
Matt.
Come on, bro, what do you miss?
WOMAN OVER PA:
We are creating a better world
where you and your family...
MAN OVER PA: You have been
tainted by American culture.
With the right leadership,
we can make this country...
You have been living in a disguised land
of righteousness.
You live in a world that segregates you
into classes.
Whatever I say is just
going to piss you off.
So why don't we just forget it?
Forget what?
That you've been putting
everyone here at risk?
Erica's still out there, Jed.
And what happens when you get caught?
Because if it were me,
you wouldn't keep looking, right?
Not if it meant putting everyone else's ass
on the line.
- I'm not you, Jed.
- No, you're not.
The team has got to come first.
Get that through your head.
Erica's my family, Jed.
She's more family than you are.
Yeah?
You're going to get us all killed.
That's how you get Cho.
JED: The rally is at
So, decoy, like before.
A little car bomb goes off here.
The crowd clears, security rushes in,
and that is when Mr. Big-Ass Mother-F
bomb under the stage
is going to blow that bastard
to kingdom come.
DELEGATE OVER PA:
Victims of an American culture
in which greed, irresponsibility
It is our sincerest belief
that with the right leadership
We have teams of engineers
ready to restore power and utilities.
We must all arouse
the political consciousness of the people.
Son of a bitch!
What?
The guy sitting behind Cho, he's Russian.
Are you serious?
The blue beret means he's Spetsnaz.
Russian Special Forces.
What's his specialty?
Counter-insurgency, for starters.
Are they here because of us?
Well, if they are, they're a little late.
You got to get out of here.
Some shit is about to happen.
We are here to facilitate
this important objective...
JED: Ninety seconds.
... while a new social and economic
initiative is implemented.
Now, regular curfews
will commence tonight.
They're designed
to preserve the social order.
Daryl.
You okay?
Yeah.
The regulatory board
has suspended all visiting hours
in bringing these cowardly
Wolverine terrorists to justice.
Blow it.
- It's not time yet.
- Blow it now!
Hold your fire. Do not engage.
Shit.
Ambush!
Daryl, come on!
Matt!
Erica!
Let's go! Let's go!
I can't!
Oh, no.
Where's the key? Where's the key, baby?
Where's the key?
- Matt!
- We gotta fall back!
Greg, come on!
- Hey, let's go!
- Greg!
- No! No!
- He's gone. We got to go now!
Let's go!
Shit! Stay down!
Stay down!
- Go, go, go!
- Go!
Go, go, go!
Here!
Are you all right? Are you all right?
Shit! We got to go, baby! We got to go!
We got to go!
Oh, shit. Get going!
Come on!
Get in here! Get in here!
Take what you need.
- Thank you.
- Be safe.
Don't worry.
Stay calm, we're almost home.
Danny, bring me the scissors.
I need more light.
Toni, I'm going to need some ice.
Can you bring some from outside?
Oh, my God. Erica!
- Hey.
- I wouldn't go in there right now.
- Why?
- Julie's freaking out.
What does that mean?
When you decided to run off
and do your own thing,
Greg was killed trying to help you.
It was a few days ago.
These Russian soldiers
came to the stadium.
They kept asking me who you guys knew
and who might be helping you.
And they even had a list of names.
Jed, all our contacts in town, man.
We can't...
Look, we are not a rescue unit.
We can't save everyone.
Wait. So we're not going to do anything?
I didn't say that, did I?
You are guilty
of giving aid to the terrorist Wolverines.
Shit.
Wolverines! Wolverines!
Wolverines!
Wolverines!
Matt's been gone for days.
I'm worried about him.
Yeah, I know.
What are you doing here, Matty?
Topping everything off.
Making sure the ammo's dry.
That's great. That's where we need you.
Off on your own, doing your own thing.
- We really gonna do this now, Jed?
- Yeah, we are.
I couldn't just leave her there.
- You left your post.
- What the hell else was I supposed to do?
I need to know I can count on you.
Well, maybe you can't.
What did you expect?
You think you're the first to feel this?
To see one of your friends get killed?
This is war.
So rub some dirt on it
and get your ass back in the fight.
Spare me, Jed.
I left for three days.
When Mom died, you left for six years.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah, Matty, you're right.
I messed up. I left you
right when you needed me the most.
And I'm sorry.
I need you to be stronger than I was.
- Mom and Dad are both gone.
- Shut up, Jed.
It's just us.
And more than anyone else in the group,
if I don't have you...
Okay. Do what you want.
MAN ON RADIO:
Guys, they're talking about us.
Wolverines, baby.
Wolverines.
It's beautiful, huh?
Very.
I wish I could look at it
without thinking of Laurie Stewart.
What?
Laurie Stewart.
Who?
Camping? Memorial Day weekend?
I have no idea what you're talking about...
We had that huge barbecue
and I ended up getting food poisoning,
so I was in and out of my tent
all night puking,
and that's when I saw the two of you
ducking into the lake together.
- Oh, that Laurie Stewart.
- Oh, yeah, that one.
Oh, man.
You know, she was a good kisser.
- She smelled like Aqua Net.
- What?
Hairspray.
Shit, that's right.
She had that terrible haircut.
The one that I immediately copied
and wore all through middle school,
which you never noticed, by the way.
No, I noticed. It was awful.
Oh, shit. Go, go!
Go! Go! Go!
- We're safer inside!
- No way I'm staying in here!
Julie? Julie?
Julie!
- Danny? Danny?
- Robert, she's gone.
- We gotta go. He's gone.
- Danny!
Daryl? Daryl? Can you hear me?
Come on, we gotta go. We gotta go.
Grab your weapon.
Let's move, come on.
Run.
Let's go, Matty. Matty, come on!
I gotta stop.
Come on.
You can do it. I'll help you.
I got it.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Here.
Jed?
You should try to get some sleep.
I'm okay.
You know, this was...
This was bound to happen, sooner or later.
Yeah.
I was talking to the group, Jed.
They're starting to question everything.
Nobody's saying they want to quit, but...
Yeah?
What do you think, Matty?
Rub some dirt on it.
Who are you?
You might want to answer that first.
Let's put down those weapons.
Then we can lose the masks.
What kind of shit-show did we drop into?
Sergeant Major Andrew Tanner.
Marine Corps.
We're Alpha Company.
Recently un-retired.
Out of where?
Camp Pendleton.
When there was a Camp Pendleton.
Now we're part of the Free American Army.
Three guys?
That's it?
What good are three guys?
Hey, shit-for-brains.
You're sassing a United States Marine.
All right, look, we're trying to link up
with a group of insurgents working the area.
Call themselves Wolverines.
- You ever hear of them?
- Yeah, we've heard of them.
You here to help them out?
No. Actually, we were hoping
they could help us out.
We're camped just below here.
We got clean water and bandages
and another camp
about six miles west of here.
We were gonna try and push on
after we ate.
We're the Wolverines.
I was afraid of that.
So how did we get here?
What happened to our defense?
It went defunct.
Shit-ified.
There's a new class of weapon.
It caused a massive electrical pulse.
Everything went off-line
and never came back.
Grids fried, subs drowned.
They mopped up by hitting cities
with tactical non-nuke warheads
and landed ground troops
where they needed strategic pressure.
What about the Russians?
Shit, they got the whole Eastern seaboard.
We know they supplied hardware
and aircraft,
but North Korea locked down
the Pacific Northwest.
So it's over?
Over?
What is this?
A rifle.
That's right, motard. A
marine and his rifle.
It's the baddest shit-kicking weapon
in the world.
And I'm still breathing, so it ain't over.
Far from it.
Lucky for us, they bit off
more than they could chew.
A lot of this country is still free
and up for a fight.
Hoorah.
Michigan to Montana, Alabama to Arizona,
that's still free America right now.
We're only 50, 60 miles from the border.
SMITH: That's right.
And other places, too,
swinging back our way.
Wide-open shooting war in Florida.
Texas-Mexican border
has been burning for weeks.
All because of folks like you.
You've made a difference. Hell, you...
You are the difference.
So how can we help?
What we can't figure out is how come
they're not crippled by their own weapon.
You guys ever see them using something
like this?
Hey, Matt, is your phone still working?
Well, , Wolverines.
What is it?
It's how they talk to each other.
A closed network for communication.
So it can't be hacked.
But if we had it,
it'd be the foothold we need
to start pushing them out
and take our homes back.
And you want to steal it?
Rapidly.
- You good?
- Yeah.
JED: They've fortified the police station
with bunkers on all four sides.
A couple of mobile structures
acting as barracks
that house the off-duty personnel.
There is at least 20 guys in there
at any one time.
And a ton of firepower.
I got a news flash for you.
There's no way in there.
Oh, there's one.
What, we jump?
Yeah, that's the plan.
That's not a plan.
That's a shit sandwich without the bread.
Cover me.
Shit!
I hate these kids.
Hate 'em.
Son of a bitch!
Hodges, you're with me.
Smith, you grow roots up here.
You hear anything that sounds
like Americans getting their asses kicked,
you make damn sure those girls know
when it's their turn to dance.
Any guesses where that little green box is?
Yeah.
We're gonna follow the wire.
Down! Down! Down!
Welcome to shit's creek, motards.
All right.
Our wire just split
into three different directions.
Nothing's easy.
All right, here's the plan.
You two, take the back stairs.
Follow the line down to the ground floor.
Jed, Matt, you stay up here,
trace the other two.
Hodges, you're with me.
We're going to secure the front door.
Let's find this thing
and get back to the hood.
It's a good day to die, gentlemen.
What did he say?
Don't worry about it. Marines don't die.
They just go to hell and regroup.
What did he say?
Clear.
Dude, they're not gonna keep
their uber box under the frigging couch!
How do you know?
It's a vital piece of military equipment,
not your porn stash.
You got this.
My wire goes to Cho's office.
And he's home... Shit!
This is about to get interesting.
Matty, where are you?
Smith, you're on.
C'mon, ladies, show us your guns.
Shit!
Come on!
We gotta get out of here!
Run!
He was just here.
Keep them away from the box.
Shit!
Not gonna happen.
Grenade!
Tanner!
- Get that thing out of here. I'll cover.
- No, I'm not leaving you.
God damn it, Matty.
Get that thing out of here. Go!
Matt Eckert!
You fucked with the wrong family.
Get this out of here, Robert.
Where's the box?
It's safe.
All right, let's get out of here.
It's pretty deep.
Yeah, but it doesn't hurt. It's okay.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm okay.
I'll be right there.
Collateral.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah. Sure.
What's up?
Nothing. I...
I was just thinking, you know, and...
I'm not very good at this, man.
Good at what?
Giving you props when you get it right.
And letting you know that
I'm proud of you.
Yeah.
Yes, Jed. That's not one of your strengths.
- No.
- No, it's not.
So, how about that beer now?
Wow.
My first one.
Where's yours?
She stole it from me.
Go get it.
Matt! Watch the back!
Tanner! Cover me!
Robert, get Erica out of here.
- I'm not leaving without you!
- God damn it, do what I say, Robert!
When you hit the deck, watch your ass.
I'll catch up. Go!
TONI: Help me! Jed!
- Come on, Toni.
- We can't leave him!
Come on!
God damn it, Toni.
We need you back in the fight.
Come on! I know. I know.
Tanner! Can we get out your way?
Make it quick.
Go, go, go, go!
Move your asses!
Let's go!
Smith!
How did they know?
How did they know where we were, bro?
- They must have followed us.
- No.
No way they could track us.
Daryl, lift up your jacket.
Let me see this. Let me see it.
Oh, shit.
What is it?
It's not a knife wound.
They tagged him with something.
Like what they do with animals.
What?
They're tracking him?
Daryl.
You...
- No.
- You led them right to us.
- I didn't know!
- You led them right to us!
Let go!
You killed Jed!
Matty, he killed Jed.
You can cut it out of him, right, Robert?
Cut it out of him.
There's no way. With what?
Matt, we got to move.
Let's just get back in the car.
- Let's keep going.
- We can't.
They'll find us.
What else are we supposed to do?
Robert.
Get me some gear.
What?
They could be here any minute.
Daryl.
Can I borrow your SAW?
So anyone want a lift back
to the land of the free?
We got plenty of room.
I'm sorry for the loss of your men.
We've all lost something, Matt.
You've done enough.
You've done more than enough.
I appreciate that.
The fact is
we're not doing too bad
for a bunch of kids.
We're going to fight.
And we're going to keep fighting
because it's easier now.
And we're used to it.
The rest of you are going to
have a tougher choice.
Because we're not going to sell it to you.
It's too ugly for that.
But when you're fighting
in your own backyard,
when you're fighting for your family,
it all hurts a little less
and makes a little more sense.
PRISONERS:
Wolverines!
Wolverines!
Wolverines!
