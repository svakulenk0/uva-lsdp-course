John! You alright?
Yeah.
Come on.
Did you get him?
-l got him.
You sure?
-Took one in the face.
He's dead. Relax.
What're you talking about, John?
You sound like you know this guy.
Nah. Just talk to you cause
l'm a real independent contractor...
to deal with the trance.
Suppose to be the best.
Same gunner that ClA
used to encounter that time.
Yeah... same guy that turn on this
handlers and killed 3 agents.
l heard it was 5.
lt's bullshit story, John.
You know that, alright?
Those are phantom. He's a myth.
Some of the agents can't get a change.
That's if he shows,
this bullet's his signature.
Do you really think Rogue
was working for Yakuza?
That's the trouble in this business.
You never know who's working for who.
This is the San Francisco police.
Remain where you are
with your hands in the air.
Yep. He's right here.
He's right here, John.
See you soon. Okay, bye-bye.
You tell him that he cannot smoke
in front of the kids!
lf he's going to smoke
he can do it in the yard.
Okay.
Go play.
l thought he was quitting anyway.
-l thought he was too.
Yo, Tom!
-Gotcha!
You better be on the road.
Jam starts at 8:30.
l'm working on what the hell it is.
See if you got any traffic,
we'll make it behind after.
John.
Smoke fixation.
Hey, come on. Get your coat.
So, how's the case going?
Don't forget about the case.
John, you're on sick leave.
No. lnvestigations are on the way.
So far it's zip.
Somebody talked to him. Somebody inside.
Close to us.
And they know what happened to Rogue?
No, they never found the body.
They drag that pave for 3 days
and nothing.
And he's fisher by now.
Okay. Well, you scanned there, right?
Yeah. l've done this. Just tell me
how to forgot these things, okay?
Alright, so l didn't forget these things.
Christ, when are you gonna let that go?
Diane has made a check. She also
asked me to...
Hey... l heard, no smoking
in front of the kids.
Honey, we gotta stop off
and get some steaks.
Diane, hurry up.
No! Please!
No!
Diane, what's up?
Diane?
No!!
John. John. Honey.
Honey. Honey.
Oh my God.
Stay here with Daniel.
Where do you think you keep going?
l'm gonna have...
We have 3 fatal.
-What?
One male, one female and one child.
Sir. The ClA needs to finish.
We gotta let them do their thing.
Sir?
You gotta clear out of here now.
SAN FRANClSCO
THREE YEARS LATER
YAKUZA DlSTRlCT
My turn next...
Get him!
Make a hole.
Get these people out of here.
Just who the hell are you?
Asian Organized Crime Unit.
We'll be taking over from here.
Who's the authority?
-Mayor? President? Take your pick.
You don't look very Asian to me.
l know how to make sure you two
don't have this case wrap up by now.
Checked this? You Einstein?
Yes. l'm gonna cut the faces,
not the armor.
Agent Crawford?
l found this in the backroom.
We found him hiding underneath
one of the dead bodies.
He's in pretty bad shape.
Yeah. What's he been saying?
You can't right?
Who could understand all that shit?
These people come in to this country.
Think they'd at least learn
to speak American.
l think a couple of cops,
work in this district...
that close to Yakuza must learn
to speak a little Japanese.
lf they weren't
complete fucking idiots...
Give me a minute, would you?
Hi...
l'm a cop.
What happened here?
Know what l do when l'm not a cop?
l play doctor.
Hey! You can't do that!
lf l don't get this shrapnel out...
lt will get infected.
l got it.
No, it's a bone.
Sorry.
You want me to go back to my day job...
Give me something to do!
l want to die...
...before he comes back.
Well, l see it's gonna be a real picnic
working with you.
You ain't no working with me.
lt's the FBl case now.
You wanna help?
Take my shoes to the cleaners.
So what do you say?
A bunch of Japanese mumbo-jumbo.
There's no spirits.
Those stories.
Jen?
You haven't wake up?
lt's almost 9.
l was working late last night, so...
Well, l just call to remind you that...
it's Daniel's first basketball game
this Friday.
You forgot, didn't you?
No. Just a bit tired.
-See you.
Got a little thing on my mind right now.
Yeah. So what's it this time?
l found him, Jen.
Found who?
The guy who killed Tom.
He's back. l can feel it.
This time l'm taking him down.
John, it's been 3 years.
Look. You obsession with this man
has cost you our marriage.
Don't lose your son.
Tell Daniel l'll be there.
-No! You tell him.
lf you say you're gonna be there,
then be there.
Those of you who didn't get to meet
last night, this is Agent Goi.
Just graduated in Chronicle.
What's his aspects?
Oarsman.
What's so funny?
How the way you expect here?
What are you?
-D.T
Defensive Tactics.
That's right.
l dig it up close in person.
Yeah. Well, my gun's bigger than yours.
Pick a desk.
Still get to sit your arse up.
Back there.
These are all the photos
anybody has of Rogue.
The guy work up his face every 6 months.
Come on, John.
Anybody can use titanium shields
and DU bullets.
Bullets found...
Bullets that we found last night
matches the ones we found 3 years ago.
Rogue's back.
Okay, if he works for the Yakuza...
Why would he kill Yakuza?
Maybe he switch sides.
This won't be the first time.
Who're we talking about?
Shiro Yamaga.
He's all Yakuza activity from Japan.
Probably the most powerful man
in San Fancisco...
and he hasn't set foot on American soil.
Except for it wasn't this test force
was put together.
The Chang is on the left.
Like Chio Chang lives here.
Nice big mansion in Marin.
lt's the Jade rock-a-fella or something.
He's a 49. Trial at Boston.
lnto everything.
Bribery, extortion, murder, you name it.
Shiro put in Chang's family.
Just let the balls
to flood in to Hong Kong.
Wiped out the whole fucking clan.
He spent the next 30 years selling
every ornament of Qing dynasty...
to collectors and museums.
Well, that slave now
is a couple of oasis.
Stash woods. Two of them.
About this big.
Word on the street is that Shiro
was looking for a buyer as we speak.
Chain lost of honor.
lt means more or less financial lost.
l don't care about the oasis.
l don't care about bloodlines
or ancient family feuds.
But the first time in 3 years,
we got a real shiny clue.
All we have to do, ladies and gentlemen.
ls pull the fucking thread out.
CHANG MANSlON
MARlN COUNTY, CA
She's a very rare breed.
And delusion.
That's my wife, Maria.
ln my father's days, such reunion
when l have been possible.
But time's changed.
Those of us who change with it...
survive.
Come.
l am really impressed, Mr. Sho.
l heard that you've spilt
the blood of my enemies.
Let's drink.
To our new partnership.
l have to admit,
l was somewhat skeptical when you first
came to me with your proposal.
By living share a service,
that was a wise move on your part.
But it makes me wonder.
How could one truly trust a man
who had betrayed his master?
l have no master.
So l have betrayed no one.
So, tell me.
My Horses, they arrive tonight?
lt's been 30 years.
All this time, my family has lived
in shame and dishonor.
All because of Shiro's treachery.
Tonight, l will take back what was stolen
from my family.
And everything will change from here on.
Shiro's men will protect his treasure
with their lives.
Are you certain... you can deliver them?
l said that l would.
These two are the Ti brothers.
They will give you everything you need.
l'll be in touch.
Watch him closely.
YAKUZA COMPOUND
TOHOKU, JAPAN
l beg your forgiveness.
The fault is not yours, but mine.
l left myself unguarded.
l trust you have news from San Francisco.
Yes, everything is proceeding
as requested.
And the Horses?
We've shipped them out.
They will arrive
in San Francisco tonight.
You must return to San Francisco...
...in advance of my arrival.
But Father...
l don't trust our people there.
They have become too lazy to be useful.
l was hoping to stay here...
...and further my role in the clan.
Nothing in the history of our clan...
...has ever been more important.
l will not fail you.
Go now. Oversee the sale of the Horses.
CHlNATOWN, SAN FRANClSCO
Hey, what's up, dude?
l'd like to see Benny.
No Benny's here.
Yeah. Again!
Hey baby.
We need to talk.
l don't talk to defense.
Someone glad. Now.
My guys lose in anyways.
Business is good l see.
Has the most for homerun security, right?
lt's the part of the family.
l bet that is fine.
lt's a gem. That's another story.
You have every right there.
How did you fuck that up?
lt wasn't hard.
Anyway. Thanks for the help.
You make me look good.
-l hope it helps.
People out there didn't expect the FBl
pay me so good to something like this.
Makes me look the gym.
Was that the end to poor Hamburg?
Come on, John.
They know signs, catch and crooks.
You know that.
They just said you have something for me.
-Yeah.
Our friend over in Russels, the guy
who make those titanium bullets.
Found him two days ago.
Now you'll have to check and see
if everyone on those association...
was wrong and having some bad luck.
Just last week.
Plastic surgeon Dr. Paramount.
He has deadly buried himself for the
kitchen knife making a turkey sandiwch.
Week before that, another one of our
scrapper friend Donald Florida was killed
Some gangs. Can't see to read the signs.
Anyway.
These guys, they're both specialize
in facial reconstruction.
Both of them.
Mass ton of blue sense.
Yeah. Well, there's another surgeon
who's accounted for.
l think he might be still alive.
Maybe trying to get out.
You let me know this set of services...
and its money.
Button up, this isn't a disco.
ls that our contact?
Yes... my contact.
Get rid of him.
He's my brother. He's with me.
What the fuck this guy thinks he is?
Go back to the car.
Wu, please. He's an outsider.
-Go!
Don't make me say it again.
After this is done...
...you and l are going to talk.
The Horses are intact.
Shiro will be pleased.
We'll contact you when we get there.
Are the Horses safe with this crew?
Of course, as far as they know...
...they're just delivering cars.
Stay calm and cooperate.
lt's just a routine check.
l need you out of the car.
Both of you.
Put your hands where l can see them.
Oh, no, sir.
You're shooting on our enterprises.
You're making a huge mistake.
We made the arrangements.
-Out of the car!
Turn around.
You're playing fire on us.
Who's your captain?
Shut up.
-Let go off us.
Shut up.
Fucking rent-a-cops...
-l said shut up.
Did you check the entrance?
What the fuck is going on?
l thought we made arrangement.
Just a little change of the plan.
l need my money. Now.
So, we're all good to go?
Oh yeah. You're good to go.
Just wait here for a sec.
Let me and the boys clear out.
Let's go.
Do it.
