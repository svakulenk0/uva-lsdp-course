No way they're going to bring
those automated vacuum loaders here.
When they installed them on 1 4 and 23,
they said it was a temporary experiment.
Well, they're still there.
Some temporary!
Hand me that coupler, would you?
What about Wooton?
He's a shop steward. What'd he say?
I'll tell you what Wooton said.
Zip. That's what he said.
They're always trying to pull something.
That's a lot of crap!
They've run a 7 worker shift since they
installed those loaders on 1 4 and 23.
Hey, you read the contract.
That's what it says. Eight.
In black and white.
So they want to get cute,
I can get cute, too.
I want a meeting.
Maybe we need a new shop steward.
Bylaws are bylaws.
Can't they regulate these suits?
It's minus 1 75 degrees.
We broil our asses off.
-Where's your other suit?
-In the shop.
Put some Mylar over the sensor.
It steps down the heating coil
and you'll be cooler.
Really?
No, moron, I made it up.
Oh, God!
I hate spiders!
Kill it!
Kill it!
Hey, Tarlow, what's eating you?
Get it off! Get it off my leg!
Somebody please help me!
Tarlow, what's the matter with you?
Get what off?
Spider! Please help me! Get it off!
Spider? Have you popped your cork?
How can there be a spider here?
There's nothing alive here.
Get it off! Oh, get it off! Oh, God!
Very funny.
We're not falling for nothing.
Cut the garbage and get back to work.
Oh, God, it's getting inside!
Get it out! Get it out!
Somebody please help me!
Somebody help me get it out of my suit!
Is it the buttermilk kind?
I'm afraid so.
They were running out of the other kind.
I can hardly talk with these braces.
It won't be much longer.
-How much longer?
-Pretty soon.
How soon?
-How soon for what?
-Till I get my braces off.
-You want crooked teeth?
-I don't mind them.
You'll be missing some teeth
in a minute if you don't eat breakfast.
Pretend it's not buttermilk.
Pretend I ate them.
Marshal, it's Lowell.
The night watch went okay.
Nothing much.
Just a couple of drunks.
We'll watch it tonight.
That's it.
I'll be in your office at 18:00.
Marshal, it's Montone.
Nothing more on that incident...
...in the mine yesterday.
Some guy went whacko.
The Company's shipping the body back,
or what's left, on today's shuttle.
It's impossible to do an autopsy.
You should have seen that mess!
Anyway, definitely no homicide.
There were two witnesses
when it happened.
It happens every once
in a while up here.
Some people let this place get to them.
So, that's about it.
Tell your wife that Transportation
got the tickets for her.
I'll see you
when you get to the office.
And don 't worry,
you'll get used to it.
What tickets?
Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds,
the nice couple from the bakery.
They wanted tickets
for the weekly shuttle for a friend.
So I said I'd see what I could do.
Well, I'd better go.
See you for dinner, sport.
-And remember, 7 pages of math.
-I promise.
-You be good today.
-I will.
Look, I know this is a lousy assignment.
And I know what it is for you.
How difficult.
Just give it a chance.
It won't be so bad.
I know.
I love you.
I love you, too.
We've only been here two weeks.
It'll get better. I promise.
l got to go.
You smell good.
And finally,
I realize that I'm new here. . .
. . .and I've got to get to know you,
and you've got to get to know me.
I just hope that I can
justify your confidence.
Thank you.
-I really wowed them.
-Had them eating out of your hand.
Are there any questions?
Marshal?
Flo Spector. . .
. . .Accounting Services.
I'm sure I speak for all of us. . .
. . .in extending our welcome
to you and your family.
If Mrs. O'Niel or your son should need
anything, tell them to call me.
Thank you very much.
I'll be sure and tell my wife.
Her name is Carol.
I see there are no more questions.
I add my welcome to Marshal O'Niel.
I'm sure we all agree
he'll have a pleasant tour.
Right now,
he's just getting started here.
Soon he'll see that this
is like every other mining town.
-There's never much trouble.
-I'm glad to hear it.
Just remember that these men
and women work hard. Very hard.
Since I've been the general manager,
we've broken all productivity records.
We're becoming the leading
Con-Amalgamate operation.
And everyone in this room has
received the bonus checks to prove it.
Good work only comes
from contented people.
I work these people hard. . .
. . .and I let them play hard.
When it comes time
for them to let off steam. . .
. . .you have to allow them some room.
Long as no harm's done,
just give them a little room.
Understand what I'm saying, Marshal?
Thanks for the advice, Mr. Sheppard.
We're all professionals.
I'm sure we are.
Drop by my office.
We'll talk some more.
I'll do that.
Don't get your nose out of joint.
What was that all about?
-It's just his way.
-I don't like his way.
-Don't mess with him.
-He's an asshole.
A very powerful asshole.
Don't mess with him.
He's just trying to sniff you out.
The last marshal kept things
running smooth. That's all they want.
Things run smooth,
they make their money.
Nobody's here for their health, and they
certainly aren't here for the scenery.
What is that guy doing?
He's going in the elevator!
He's going in the elevator
without a suit on!
Carol?
I'm trying to keep my composure.
And like everything I do,
I think I'm messing this up.
I despise these message things.
I'm just such a coward.
I couldn 't look at your face and say
what I'm about to say. I just couldn 't.
If you were in front of me,
I'd change my mind.
And I don 't want to change my mind.
I love you.
Please know that.
I hadn 't planned this.
I really hadn 't.
I just can 't take it anymore.
That's what it amounts to.
I know we've been over this
so many times before.
The same crying from me,
and the same assurances from you.
That the next place will be different.
But it never is. It can 't be.
So yesterday,
something snapped in me.
I just couldn 't bear to see Paulie...
...clatter around yet another
bleak place. I just couldn 't.
He's a child.
He's never set foot on Earth.
Never!
He looks at pictures
and reads books of Earth...
...all day long. And he hides them
from you so your feelings won 't be hurt.
Don 't you see he deserves a childhood?
He deserves a chance
to breathe air, real outside air...
... where you don 't broil or explode.
Air that smells like life!
Not like a ventilating unit!
I'm just not as good as you are.
I don 't think it's worth it.
So I'm taking Paulie back home.
I love you.
You don 't deserve this.
You deserve the best.
I've just got to go now, my love.
I'll contact you...
...in a few days from the space station
before we finally leave for Earth.
What do we have here?
What's happening with the purser's area?
We've put monitors
on the whole area for 36 hours. . .
. . .and things have been quiet.
Keep the monitors on for two weeks.
-And the detonators?
-They were found.
Where?
I don't know.
The foreman reported them found. . .
. . .then told me to forget about it.
Nelson, we're talking about
nuclear detonators.
You just don't lose them
and then find them.
You lose your comb, then find it.
Not detonators.
I want to know where they were found
and who found them. Get it?
Good for you, Nelson.
Slater, what about the incident
in the mine elevator?
Nothing much to tell, Sarge.
Some cupcake named Cane decided
he didn't need an environment suit.
They're still sponging him
off the elevator walls.
He was alone. Nobody near enough
to have thrown him in.
Some guys tried
to get into the airlock. . .
. . .except he'd sealed it.
No way it was homicide.
-Had to have been a suicide.
-Did he leave a note?
I beg your pardon?
Did he leave a note?
None that we know of, sir.
Then how do you know it was suicide?
There's no other explanation.
He knew what he was doing,
that's for sure.
You can't fall into an airlock
and then an elevator.
You have to open hatches,
press buttons, close hatches.
It's the only explanation.
Thank you.
Okay. Fanning.
-What about the pump station?
-Just a fight.
We took them both in to cool off.
They straightened out soon.
-Gil?
-Pretty quiet.
Couple of calls about noise.
Nothing much.
Who ordered all these pressure packs?
This is a mine, not a war.
-You did, doctor.
-I said 1 00. Not 1 ,000.
I said 1 00, which can't be mistaken
for anything except 1 00.
It doesn't sound remotely
Iike 1 ,000. Listen!
You'll hear what I mean.
One thousand.
One hundred.
Totally different.
You think they sound the same?
Who are you, anyway?
Are you Dr. Lazarus?
Two aspirins and call me in the morning.
Doctor joke. Are you the new marshal?
Yes. I'd like to talk to you.
I got an alibi. Four people will swear
we were playing poker.
I never heard that one before.
-That's really funny.
-Sorry.
Yesterday, a man went into the
atmosphere without his pressure suit.
A couple of days before, another
man cut his suit open on purpose.
It happens here.
How often?
-I don't know. It just happens here.
-Why?
I'm not a psychiatrist.
I can't tell you why.
Some people can't take it
here after awhile.
-Did you do autopsies?
-No.
Why not?
The Company wanted the bodies
shipped out quickly.
Secondly, when one exposes
himself to zero-pressure atmosphere. . .
. . .there isn't a lot to inspect.
In the third place,
you're becoming a nuisance.
Yes, I know.
Give me a report of all of the incidents
happening over the past 6 months.
I'd like it soon, or I might just kick
your nasty ass all over this floor.
That's a marshal joke.
It's open.
I didn't know what you'd like to eat,
so I brought everything.
Listen, you got to eat something.
Can't catch crooks
on an empty stomach.
I know how you feel. I do.
The second time I did a tour,
my wife had skipped off. . .
. . .with some computer programmer.
I have two daughters.
They call the programmer daddy.
My wife said she was happy.
I said, ""Happy?
The guy looks so boring. ""
She said he was not Mr. Excitement,
but he was always home.
You can't argue with that.
Try the food, it's not bad.
I will.
The hookers are nice.
They can help when you're lonely.
I'm sure.
I get the feeling I'm bombing.
No, you're not. I appreciate
what you're doing. I really do.
No, it's just. . .
. . .I'd like to be on my own for now.
I understand.
Marshal. . .
. . .if you need anything. . .
. . .if you just want to talk. . .
. . .please call me.
We've got a response on your request.
I'm trying to keep my composure...
...and like everything else I do,
I think I'm messing this up.
I despise these message things.
I'm just such a coward.
I couldn 't look at your face and say
what I'm about to say. I just couldn 't.
If you were in front of me,
I'd change my mind.
What?
How bad?
I'll be right there.
Marshal, he's in the west wing.
Sergeant Montone is waiting for you.
He's in a leisure compartment roughing
up a hooker. She pushed the alarm.
When I responded, he said he had a knife
and would kill her if I didn't leave.
A crane operator named Sagan. Been
here 1 1 months, never caused trouble.
-How's the girl?
-She's still alive.
Is he stoned?
Beats me. Some guys like
to slap hookers around.
This is Marshal O'Niel. Let that girl
out and no one's going to hurt you.
Now listen to me!
Just listen.
I can't go away and you know that.
Now nobody's going to hurt you.
If you want to talk, we'll talk.
I won't try to break in. . .
. . .and you don't do anything crazy
with that girl. Okay?
Go away!
-Get me a maintenance worker.
-Yes, sir.
Which vent leads to the air conditioning
duct for number two compartment?
Open it.
Open the hydraulic valves to release
the door locks when I tell you.
Sagan, can you hear me?
I hear you!
I'll explain this to you. . .
. . .very carefully.
I will release the hydraulic pressure
on the door locks.
It will open this door.
You cannot keep the doors closed. . .
. . .and stay in.
Why don't you just come out
and make it easy?
The second that door opens,
I'll kill her!
I'm going to slice her!
I hate her!
I won't argue with you.
And I won't trick you.
I'm going to count
down from ten to one.
At one, the door
will spring open slowly.
I will not rush in.
I will not shoot you.
I don't want to hurt anybody,
including you.
Whatever the problem is. . .
. . .we can work it out,
without hurting anybody.
You're going to kill me.
No, I'm not.
You have my word.
You also have my word
that if you kill that girl. . .
. . .I will kill you.
Now I'm going to count down
from ten. . .
. . .to one, slowly.
Just do as I say.
Ten. . .
. . .nine. . .
Well, he turned.
I saw the knife.
Jaw looks broken.
Maybe the nose.
Contusions.
Neck wounds look superficial.
Jesus Christ,
who did this to her?
A worker. Went nuts.
It happens here, remember?
I got that list.
She's bleeding in the abdomen.
-Why didn't you bring it to my office?
-I don't make house calls.
She'll be all right?
Maybe, if you let me do my job.
I wonder in the 6 months before.
Good for you.
You want to know how many
in the 6 months before that? Two.
Are you sure?
I'm unpleasant, not stupid.
Of course I'm sure, I can count.
-Well, what do you think?
-I don't know.
Almost nobody has both oars
in the water, as far as I'm concerned.
Why people start to lose their marbles
in greater numbers isn't so mystifying.
I don't know why more of them
didn't do it sooner.
Where are the bodies sent?
They usually ship them out
on the next shuttle.
They wrap them up and jettison
them halfway to the station.
Burial at sea and all that crap.
Lazarus? This is O 'Niel.
I'll see you in the hospital right away.
Do you know what time it is?
You'd better be dying.
-Is this going to take long?
-You're kidding me.
That doesn't mean much.
Blood type, cholesterol count.
This blood is from a dead person.
Very good.
No alcohol.
He ate dinner.
Protein, carbohydrates. . .
. . .more carbohydrates.
He didn't eat his vegetables.
No nicotine.
Some tranquilizers.
Yeah, they're Company tranquilizers.
Standard issue.
Blood sugar and hemoglobin are normal.
-Hello.
-What?
I don't know.
Shit.
Such a smart piece of equipment,
and a wreck like me trying to run it.
You know, you haven't
your medical all-star here.
Company doctors are like ships' doctors.
Most are one shuttle flight ahead
of a malpractice suit.
Something's there, isn't it?
Maybe.
I spend my days dispensing
tranquilizers to the workers. . .
. . .and certifying that the prostitutes
don't have syphilis.
I don't know
how to analyze a new molecule.
Hello.
Is it a drug?
You just won a prize.
It's some kind of narcotic.
Nothing I've ever seen before.
Synthetic.
Bingo.
Polydichloric Euthimal.
Those stupid bastards
are taking Polydichloric Euthimal!
It's an amphetamine.
Strongest thing you ever saw.
Makes you feel wonderful.
You do 1 4 hours of work in 6 hours.
That kind of nonsense.
Especially manual labor.
It makes you work like a horse.
The Army tested it a few years ago.
It made everybody work all right.
Then it made them psychotic.
It takes a while,
ten, maybe eleven months.
And then it fries your brain.
You said it's synthetic.
Can it be made here?
No. Impossible.
It has to have been shipped in.
No autopsies.
So nobody knows anything.
The workers are producing more,
so the Company's making bigger profits.
They're not about to ask any questions.
It's quite a setup.
Don't say anything
to anybody about this.
I did good, didn't I?
For a wreck.
You did good.
Do you want to tell me about it?
Tell you about what?
Sheppard.
What about him?
How deep are you in?
Not too deep.
I'm paid to look the other way.
You don't do anything bad,
you just don't do anything good.
I'm going to bust Sheppard.
Are you serious?
This is no place for heroes.
You try to bust him. . .
. . .you're messing
with more than you think.
You're talking about
the general manager.
He's a real hotshot here.
It's big money, people and places
that we only know from letterheads.
This guy is connected with more
than just the Company.
I mean it.
There's some serious stuff involved.
What will this prove?
I'm not trying to prove anything.
That stuff they sell is killing people.
What will you do with me?
I don't know.
You want me to resign?
No. Just don't come between Sheppard
and me. Just keep taking your money. . .
. . .and looking the other way.
I don't want you.
I want him.
Your serve.
Think it over.
He's in cell 36.
-Has he said anything?
-Not a peep.
Anyone ask about him?
If anyone does,
I want to know.
This is O'Niel.
The report says you were carrying
. . .which is 400 doses.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Of course you don't.
How much does Sheppard pay you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You'll love it here, though some
start to go crazy at night. . .
. . .when you can't feel the floor.
And sometimes the air tether
gets knotted and a man suffocates.
But that doesn't happen too often.
O'Niel, piss off!
I like that.
You're real quick with a comeback.
I've got you nailed.
I've got witnesses and evidence.
You'll be shipped back and do time that
will make this place look like a picnic!
Now don't do a deal with me.
Don't get yourself a reduced sentence.
Just do your hard time
while Sheppard laughs his ass off.
I've got to hand it to you.
You're pretty sharp.
See you around, tough guy.
Nobody talks to him.
Nobody touches him.
I mean nobody, you understand?
I understand.
You know something? I can hit
a seven iron 500 yards in this place.
Fix yourself a drink.
No, thanks.
You've been busy.
So have you.
How much do you want?
How much?
Just what we need here,
a goddamn hero.
You know something?
This rug has a slight break to the left.
Let me tell you what you're
dealing with. I run a franchise.
I'm hired to dig as much ore
as possible out of this hellhole.
There's a guy like me on every
mining operation all over this system.
My hookers are clean,
some good-looking.
My booze isn't watered.
The workers are happy.
When the workers are happy, they dig
more ore. They get more bonus money.
When they dig more ore,
the Company's happy.
When the Company's happy,
I'm happy.
-Sounds wonderful.
-Nothing here is wonderful.
It works. That's enough.
Now every year a new marshal
comes to start his tour.
They all know the score. You know
the score. You're no different.
If this hero routine is to get
your price up, I'll think about it.
What are you after?
You.
What is it with guys like you?
If you were such a goddamn super-cop. . .
. . .what are you doing on
a Company mining operating like Io?
They didn't send you here as a reward
for your sterling service.
You know that and I know that.
I read your record.
You've got a big mouth.
That's why you're sent
from one toilet to the next.
Me? I don't plan on spending
the rest of my life doing this.
Well, good for you.
Now, look, this charade
of yours is silly.
You meddle, I want you to know
what you're meddling with.
You got something to prove,
prove it to yourself, not to me.
I'll see you around.
If you're looking for money,
you're smarter than you look!
If you're not,
you're a lot dumber.
I'm probably a lot dumber.
That can be very dangerous.
All right, tough guy, time to talk.
What's the matter?
Sun in your eyes?
Well, well, well, if it isn't the law!
Sheppard, guess what
I just found in a meat locker?
You know, I have a feeling that
you'll tell me even if I don't guess.
named Yario that works for you.
I also found your shipment of PDE.
I threw the hamburger in jail
and the PDE in the toilet.
Or the other way around?
I can't remember.
You've been busy.
Yeah, are you proud of me?
Real proud.
Good shot.
You destroyed the shipment?
You do have a flair for the dramatic.
Was it expensive?
More than you can ever imagine.
You could be out of business.
You know, I've misjudged you.
You're not stupid. You're crazy.
You think you caused
an inconvenience?
Is that what you think?
Why don't you go home
and polish your badge?
You're dealing with grownups here.
You're out of your league.
Whoever sent that shipment
will be mad that you lost it.
Grownups have no sense of humor.
I'd play a firm eight iron there.
Just swing easy.
You're dead.
Do you hear me?
I hear you.
Bello ws, this is Sheppard.
What the hell's been
going on down there?
Just a little trouble. I can take care
of it. Send me a few of your best men.
And the two you had?
Send me the men!
I'll straighten everything out.
My people are not going to like this.
-I'll have it straightened out.
-When do you need the men?
On the next shuttle.
I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you back later.
What have we got?
Break-in at the women's quarters.
Can't tell if it was
a pervert or a burglary.
The guy was surprised
and ran like hell.
-Any prints?
-Nothing clear.
-What else?
-Not much.
A hell of a fight in the cafeteria.
A broken nose and teeth
was the damage.
Both guys are cooling out in the tank.
Where's your sergeant stripes?
Well, it's only been a couple
of days since Sergeant Montone--
You're the new sergeant.
You wear your stripes. Put them on now.
This is Bello ws. You've got
the men you want and it wasn 't easy.
My people are very unhappy.
This could cause trouble for us
on the other operations.
If the Company got wind of what's
going on, they'd clamp down like a vise.
They can 't afford
to lose their franchise.
It could put my people out of business.
And my people like being in business.
Tell them not to worry.
How good are the men?
The best. They've left
on the shuttle arriving Sunday.
-They have their own weapons?
-Yes.
The target is O 'Niel.
-You better not mess this up!
-I won 't.
-It's your party.
-Yes, it is.
-How much help will he have?
-None.
-You sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.
No one here will stick
their neck out for anyone.
Once word spreads that
these guys are pros...
... there'll be no trouble.
I've got someone on the inside
who 'll spread the word.
Don 't worry.
He's a dead man.
I'll tell you,
if this doesn 't work out...
... the next guys who come
will be coming for you.
No sweat.
I'll call you when it's over.
How many can I count on?
Well, I don't know, sir.
What about you?
Well, you see. . .
. . .most of us are. . .
. . .most are young.
-We have families.
-I have a family.
I know where we stand.
Thank you, sergeant.
That's pretty good.
Playing by yourself and losing.
I'd join you in this dumb game
if I could play sitting down.
Yes, I'm well, thank you.
Pretty busy.
Seems there's
some flu going around.
You'd be surprised how many workers
will be sick this Sunday.
It's your actual epidemic.
Are you going to be sick
this Sunday?
If you want sterling character,
you're in the wrong place.
If you're the guy you're supposed to be,
you wouldn't stick around.
-That's why they sent you.
-Maybe they made a mistake.
I was afraid you'd say
something like that.
You really think
you're making a difference?
Then why, for God's sake?
Because. . .
. . .maybe they are right.
They send me here to this pile of shit
because they think I belong here.
I want to find out. . .
. . .if they're right.
A whole machine works because
everybody does what they're supposed to.
And I found out. . .
. . .I was supposed
to be something I didn't like.
That's what's in the program.
That's my rotten little part,
in the rotten machine.
I don't like it.
So I'm going to find out
if they're right.
Your wife is one stupid lady.
You want to go get drunk?
At least you have some sense left.
Hello, there.
I'm doing it again.
I've had so much time
to prepare what to say...
...and here I am looking at your face,
and my mouth has gone to mush.
How's Paul?
He's fine. I promised him...
...he could talk to you.
He's in the next room.
Are you well?
I'm okay.
Paulie and I....
The reservations have come through.
We're flying home.
The reservations are for three.
That was thoughtful.
I can't.
Why?
I just can't.
I wish I could.
What is so important?
I'm too tired to try to explain.
You're making a difference?
Do you think what you're doing
is worth giving up your family for?
You're a stubborn son of a bitch.
Something's wrong there, isn 't it?
No.
I know you're in some kind of trouble.
When you speak in sentences...
...of less than two words,
you're in trouble. I know it.
I'm okay.
Damn you.
Take care of yourself.
You can come in now, Paulie.
I love you.
Hi, Paul. How are you doing?
Great!
Mommy let me stay up late because
this is when the call came through.
I miss you.
I miss you, too.
Mommy says as soon as you get done,
you'll come home with us.
As soon as I get done.
What's it like on Earth?
It's beautiful.
You're going to see
many wonderful things.
And you'll have friends to play with.
Mommy says that on the flight, they
put you to sleep for more than a year.
That's true.
Will it hurt?
Not a bit. You'll just wake up. . .
. . .and be home.
I'm going to sleep through my birthday.
Next birthday,
I'll get you two presents.
Can 't you come home with us?
Not right now.
Soon?
Soon.
I love you, Daddy.
I love you too, Paul.
You take care of Mommy.
I will.
See you, Daddy.
I could use a little help.
I thought so.
You should protect us.
You're the police. It's your job.
Where are your men?
My men?
My men are shit.
Jesus, take it easy!
What are you doing here?
I went to your office to offer help.
I saw you on the screen.
You're heading right for them.
You're in terrific shape.
They've missed the artery.
I'll stop the bleeding.
Which way were they heading?
They were going to the operations wing.
They're trying to cut you off.
Could you seal off the access ways
in the east quadrant?
I'll go out around them.
Thank you.
Don't misconstrue.
I'm not displaying character. . .
. . .just temporary insanity.
I'm going outside.
Now get the hell out of here.
I can help.
Don't argue with me!
Seal the access corridors. . .
. . .and lead them into C-5.
Don't get maudlin.
Can I help?
Terrific. Here comes the cavalry.
You're a bit late.
-Is the marshal all right?
-So far.
Where is he?
Outside somewhere.
Outside where?
How the hell should I know?
Maybe in the greenhouse.
Oh, fuck it.
How's the arm?
It's all right.
I was on my way to drinking myself into
a stupor and I thought I'd say goodbye.
You were a good friend.
Thank you.
Thank you. There hasn't been so much
excitement in this heap for some time.
Well, I have to go now.
Me too. It's going to hit the fan around
here and I want to watch it happen.
You did good.
So did you.
Damn right.

In a mining town...
...on the second moon of Jupiter...
...something deadly is happening.
Pretty soon you'll see that this is
just like every other mining town.
I work these people hard. . .
. . .and I let them play hard.
There's never much trouble.
We're all professionals.
I'm sure we are.
We've only been here 2 weeks.
It'll get better.
I promise.
Nothing more on that mine incident.
It looks like some guy just went wacko.
-It happens here.
-How often?
I don't know.
It just happens here.
Why?
I'm not a psychiatrist.
I can't tell you why.
Some people can't take it here
after awhile.
What's that guy think he's doing?
No way it could've been homicide.
Had to have been a suicide.
Did you do autopsies?
No.
Then how do you know
that it was a suicide?
There's no other explanation.
When one is exposed to zero pressure,
there isn't a whole lot left to inspect.
Something's there, isn't it?
Maybe.
Try and meddle, I want you to know
what you're meddling with.
You're out of your league.
You know, we're grownups here.
Bingo.
Marshal. . .
. . .you're dead.
If you're the kind of guy
you're supposed to be. . .
. . .you wouldn't stick around.
That's why they sent you here.
Maybe they made a mistake.
Outland.
The ultimate enemy is still. ..
...man.
