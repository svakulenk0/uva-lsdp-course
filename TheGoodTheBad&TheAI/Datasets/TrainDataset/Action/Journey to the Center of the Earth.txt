Trevor!
Max.
Whoa, whoa.
Although Wegener was ridiculed
by the scientific community...
...he was eventually found
to be correct...
...in his theory of an original
supercontinent called Pangaea.
Yeah. Okay.
Ah. Come to papa.
TREVOR:
Hey, Leonard.
LEONARD:
Hey, man.
- Dude, you ain't gonna be happy.
- Why?
- It's Kitzens.
- I see.
- Hello.
- Trevor, there's my favorite colleague.
- How are you, Alan?
- I'm good.
- How's that Con Drift class of yours going?
- Fine.
Does it get echoey in there
with so few students?
So, what do you got on the books?
I'm busy.
No, no, I can see how busy you are.
So I'll try to be
as quick as possible here.
The university is pulling the plug
on your brother's lab.
Pulling the plug?
Yeah, it's gonna finally give us
all the storage space we need.
Let's get something straight here,
this facility is dedicated...
...to the research of Maxwell Anderson's
theories predicting the volcanic fissures...
Which have never been proven.
I mean, how many of your late brother's
sensors are even still active? One, two...?
- Three.
- It used to be 29.
This is the wrong time to shut us down.
I have got seismic activity in Bolivia.
I got a 13 millimeter shift in Mongolia.
Alan, you can't shut us down.
Keep the lab open.
- It's all I've got left of Max.
- It's been 10 years since Max, Trevor.
I am sorry about all this. I really am.
WOMAN :
BOY:
WOMAN:
- No.
BOY:
- Oh, no.
WOMAN:
- Oh, boy.
-
-
BOY:
WOMAN:
TREVOR :
WOMAN:
Trevor, you in there?
TREVOR:
Hi.
- Hey.
- How are you, Elizabeth?
- Oh, you're home.
- It's so good to see you.
You too.
- How are you? I just got your messages.
- Uh-huh.
- You forgot, didn't you?
- I didn't forget.
How could I forget?
- You didn't forget?
- I...
I forgot.
It doesn't mean I haven't been...
...looking forward
to time with my nephew.
I haven't seen him since he was 9?
- Seven.
- Wow. Ha-ha.
So how long
is he gonna be staying again?
- Ten days.
- Is that what we said?
Hey, Sean. How are you?
Looking good.
- Is that one of those Game Boys?
- It's a PSP.
- Cool.
- Sean, get up, say hi to your uncle.
Hi to your uncle.
Last time I saw you,
you were about this high.
- Oh! Ha-ha.
- Yeah, good one.
You got that?
Okay, you've got all my numbers.
You've got your ticket
and passport in your bag.
I will be there to pick you up in Ottawa.
And by then I'll have found us a house
and we can start on this big new adventure.
- Pretty exciting stuff, huh?
SEAN: Yeah, it's great.
We get to be Canadians. Thrilling, eh?
Just let yourself in.
- It will be good for him, being with you.
- Yeah.
Who knows?
Maybe it will be good for you too.
This is for you.
What...? Is this Sean's?
No, it's Max's.
- Max's?
- Yeah.
So, hey, dude. This is gonna be fun.
A couple of dudes hanging out.
Five days, maybe a week.
You know, doing dude stuff,
what dudes do.
You like baseball?
You know what we should do?
We should go get in a batting cage.
Yeah, okay, listen.
I don't like this any more than you do.
As long as you keep stocked
with Mountain Dew...
...and TiVo
we'll get along fine.
- Sure.
- Oh, wow.
- That's an awesome coin collection.
- Oh.
Well, kind of a pet project of mine.
- Yeah, it's really nifty.
- Thanks.
You hungry?
We could order in, you know.
Maybe some pizza, Chinese, Thai food?
Subs? Or something like that?
- Wow.
- What's that?
Well, it's a box of possessions
of a really great guy.
Your dad.
His old ball glove.
Mom doesn't talk about him very much.
Well, you can take my word for it.
He was one of those few people...
...who are just exceptional
at everything they do.
Ooh. You see this?
This was your old man's PSP.
- A yo-yo?
- Don't be dissing the yo-yo.
This is physics at work.
You got your centrifugal force.
Your gravitational pull,
you got your potential energy.
And in ancient times, did you know...
...that this was actually used
as a hunting implement?
Watch.
- Hey, here, let me try.
- Yeah, you should probably take it.
I have no idea what this is.
Hello.
This was his favorite book.
Jules Verne's
You know, I think that was
on my summer reading list once.
- I never got to it.
- That's too bad, it's a good read.
To him, it wasn't just science fiction,
it was inspiration.
He used to read this to me
when I was a really little kid.
Hello. What are these notes?
"Magma temperatures reach 1150
in Mongolia"?
"Bolivia."
"Hawaii."
Look out!
Hey, Sean, let's go check out my lab.
SEAN:
So it couldn't wait for tomorrow?
TREVOR:
Your dad used to say:
"Tectonophysics is the science of now,
not tomorrow."
It's about seismic events
that occur in an instant.
Here, look at this.
You got Hawaii, Bolivia, Mongolia.
And the conditions today are almost
exactly what they were in July '97.
What's the big deal about July '97?
Sean, that was the year
that your dad went missing.
Now, look, you see this column
of numbers here?
If the 753, right here, was a 752,
then it would be...
Exactly the same.
What do these little blips mean?
Don't touch anything.
Those little blips are my life's work.
These four little blips
are your entire life's work?
Three. Three little blips.
One, two, three, four.
Iceland.
This makes sense.
Max saw the readings 10 years ago,
and he took off to investigate.
Now, if the readings are the same today
as they were then...
...this may be my only chance
to find out what happened.
- I'm gonna need your passport.
- For what?
I'm sorry, I have to get you to Canada
a little earlier than we planned.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about this.
It's all set in Iceland,
which is where he must've gone.
These are all my dad's notes?
Look...
...Max and I...
Your dad and I were talking about
the possibility of volcanic tubes existing...
...that went down past the mantle,
towards the center of the Earth.
And that's what I think
he went looking for.
Sorry, I gotta put you on a flight
to Ottawa in the morning.
- And I'm calling Icelandair.
- No, no, look.
- Hey.
- I just got here, okay?
You're not gonna go and ditch me.
I was the person who found your life's work
fourth little blip thingy in the first place.
- This is my brother we're talking about.
- It's my dad.
Now, I don't have to be in Ottawa
for 10 days. I'm going with you.
Know how much to book
a last-minute flight to Reykjavík?
Something tells me you got it covered.
TREVOR: "Descend, bold traveler,
into the crater of the jokul of Sneffels...
...which the shadow of Scartaris touches
before the kalends of July...
...and you will attain
the center of the Earth."
Ooh.
Sorry.
What are you doing?
I'm deciphering these notations
that your father made in this book.
I think there's a code
behind the pairing of letters.
It might have something to do
with the periodic table.
For instance, I've got S-A, I-S, G-G.
I believe that P-B is on the periodic table
and that's plumbum.
- Plumbum means lead.
- What's "Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson"?
What?
Well, it's right here. Read it down.
Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson.
Oh. Uh...
Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson, that's...
That's a clue. Maybe that's a place.
It could be a thing.
- What are you doing?
- I am Googling at 30,000 feet.
- Are you supposed to be doing that?
- Welcome to the 21 st century.
- Okay. Here.
- It's a person.
"Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson,
executive director...
...of Ásgeirsson Institute
for Progressive Volcanology."
Max would've known this guy.
I knew it was a good thing to bring you.
His institute has gotta be our first stop.
SEAN:
Are we there yet?
TREVOR:
If you mean annoying, yeah, we're there.
- You know, you're going kind of slow.
- I'm going kind of safe.
I just saw a goat in the passing lane.
When's the whole adventure thing
gonna begin?
Let me give you something fun to do.
Navigate.
Where are we?
Have we passed Havanschlicht?
- Havanschlicht?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
Have we passed Eingarsstadir?
- I don't know.
- Reynivír?
- I don't know.
- Húsavík?
TREVOR: No.
SEAN: Grundarhol?
TREVOR: No.
SEAN: Stifflarschtarder?
TREVOR:
Stifflardschtarder?
SEAN: How about Koldukardarskinoquue?
TREVOR: What?
SEAN: We're definitely lost.
TREVOR: We're not lost.
Just look for an institution.
SEAN: What's an institution look like?
- I don't know, it looks big and institutional.
It's gotta be around here somewhere.
Hey, look, there's a little shack up there.
We can stop there and ask for directions.
- We're not lost.
- Oh, no, definitely not.
What's this? A ski shack?
"Ásgeirsson...
...lnstitute for Progressive Volcanology."
I told you I'd find it.
Alrighty.
- Not too shabby.
- All right.
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak Icelandic.
- Hi, can I help you?
- Hello.
- I'm Hannah.
- Oh, how do you do? Hi.
I'm Trev... Professor Anderson.
I'm visiting from America. Um...
- This is Sean, my nephew.
- I'm Sean.
Hi, Sean.
I was wondering if I could
possibly speak with, forgive me here...
...Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson?
Um...
Well, Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson is dead.
- Dead?
- Yeah, he died three winters ago.
Oh. Uh...
So do you run the institute?
Nobody does. There is no institute.
- There's a sign down the road that says...
- Progressive volcanology was a failed idea.
Like, you know, the Berlin Wall
and eight-track tapes.
I see.
Well, did you work with him?
No, no. He was my father.
Yeah? I know it. What about it?
Well, this book belonged
to my late brother, Max.
Max Anderson?
We believe that he may have been
in contact with your father.
- Your brother was a Vernian.
- What's a Vernian?
Someone that believes that the writings
of Jules Verne were actual fact.
I mean, the guy
was a science fiction writer.
And yet this society of believers
regarded Verne like a visionary.
My father
was the biggest Vernian of them all.
My brother was no Vernian.
This was my father's copy.
Take a look.
See, the markings are exactly the same.
Your brother was a Vernian.
Wow, my dad was kind of out there.
- You didn't know him, Sean.
- I'm starting to think you didn't either.
He was no member
of some secret society.
- What are you guys doing here?
- I'm a scientist, I'm a professor.
I'm here because there are seismic sensors
going off 30 klicks north of here...
...that we think
that we should check into.
And that's the reason that we're here,
plain and simple.
Okay.
You know,
there are no roads to the north.
Well...
I'm a mountain guide.
I can take you there, professor.
- Great.
- That's great, I love hiking.
- I would appreciate that. That'd be great.
- Good.
- Call me Trevor.
- You can call me Sean.
So it will be 5000 kronur to go up there.
Five grand a day? No problem.
An hour.
Do you accept rolls of quarters?
Come on, boys.
I wanna be home by sundown.
TREVOR: Hey, you think you can slow down
a little bit, please?
- Dibs.
- What?
I got dibs on the mountain guide.
- You're 13.
- Sorry, called it.
- Thirteen-year-olds don't get dibs.
- Get over it.
We're getting closer.
All right, just watch your step there.
Mount Sneffels is deceptively treacherous.
- What's Sneffels?
- Well, why don't you tell him, professor?
Sneffels is the name of the mountain
where this character Liedenbrock...
...apparently found a portal
to the center of the Earth.
Let's just find that sensor of yours,
professor.
TREVOR:
There it is.
Yes.
HANNAH:
Well, what do you need to do with it?
I gotta unlock it.
It's got, like, a black box...
...that has recorded
all of the seismic activity...
...that's transpired in the last 10 years.
Could tell me a lot about Max.
And what he was doing
when he went missing.
Trevor, I'm really sorry,
we're gonna have to go now.
Must be corroded.
Trevor, we need to... Whoa.
Okay, we need to take cover.
Come on, Sean. Right now.
I'll be right there.
- Trevor, just leave it for now.
TREVOR: I've almost got it.
HANNAH:
We need to take cover now.
Come on. Trevor.
- Uncle Trevor.
- Get in here.
- Yes. Oh!
HANNAH: Watch out.
Hurry up. Come on.
Trevor,
the sensor's attracting the lightning.
- Drop it. Drop the sensor.
TREVOR: What? I'm not gonna drop it.
SEAN: Hurry!
HANNAH: It's attracting the lightning!
Trevor?
- Trevor?
TREVOR: I'm all right.
HANNAH:
Sean?
- Sean, you all right?
- I'm good.
- Okay, everybody, just stay calm.
SEAN: Guys, come on, you gotta help me dig.
Come on.
- Forget it, it's no use.
- Forget it?
TREVOR:
She's right.
There must be about 60 or 70 tons
of boulders on top of us.
Take us about a month
to dig out of here.
- We have to find another way.
- What if there is no other way?
There's always another way, Sean.
What else have you got?
Signal flares, first aid, some rope, blankets
and a couple of protein bars.
But they're on a ration.
- Don't know how long we'll be trapped for.
- Trapped? Is that what we are?
She... No, she didn't mean that.
- Sean, hey, what are you doing?
- God, I'm not getting any service.
Sean, you're not gonna get any signal
down here, okay?
Put this away.
Okay, don't worry about it.
- We'll find another way out, all right?
HANNAH: Okay.
One of these
might snake back to the surface.
How do we know which one to take?
My gut says we go right.
Come on.
Looks promising.
Just put one foot in front of the other.
We'll be out of here in no time.
Looking good.
Don't worry, direction is my sixth sense.
Pay attention, Sean.
It's just like doing field work.
I used to love doing field work.
- Watch out.
- Ah!
You're not studying rocks in a lab,
professor.
- This is life or death here.
- Yeah, thanks.
You owe me one.
What does this say?
That means keep out.
- Maybe that's decent advice.
- No, no. This is great news.
This might lead us to an old mine shaft
and that could be our way out.
- How deep do you think it is?
- Can you give me one of those flares?
Thank you. Sean, look at your watch.
I'm gonna light this
and drop it over the edge...
...and I want you to tell me
how many seconds pass before it stops.
Okay.
Here we go. Three, two...
Oh, God!
HANNAH:
What?
What was that?
Yup, magnesium.
Must run in veins
all through these walls.
Magnesium is kind of flammable,
isn't it, professor?
Yeah, used in flares,
used in gun powder, matchsticks.
Right, well, maybe gun powders and flares
aren't such a good idea down here.
Thank you.
It's the same principle.
- You ready, Sean?
SEAN: Yeah, go ahead.
Three, two...
One.
Two.
Almost three.
Thirty-two squared by... It's 200 feet.
That's no problem.
It's about your basic 20-story high-rise.
- You got enough rope?
- I always have enough rope.
Well, no problem for what?
Rappelling down in there.
We're gonna rappel down
that deep, dark hole?
What, you got a problem with that?
- Pfft.
- What's the matter?
There's no way
we should be rappelling down.
What are you talking about? You're
man enough to call dibs on the guide.
- But not enough to climb down a rope.
HANNAH: Guys.
- Calling dibs on the mountain guide...
- No one gets dibs on the mountain guide.
We're going down there.
HANNAH:
Steady, steady.
Remember, we're all connected.
It's okay.
TREVOR:
Looking good.
It's all good down here.
Way down here.
You guys are coming down, right?
All right, Sean, I'm gonna start
lowering you down really, really slowly.
So just lean back
and keep your feet up high.
You're okay, Sean.
We're tethered together,
so nothing bad is gonna happen.
SEAN:
Yeah, sure.
HANNAH:
Good.
Sean, keep walking.
You have to keep walking.
Good.
TREVOR:
Hey, you're looking pretty good there.
- Sure you haven't done this before?
- Shut up.
Hey, you mind?
Watch your step, will you?
I'm hanging on for my life here.
Okay, Sean,
just make conversation with me.
So, Hannah, do you come here often?
TREVOR:
Oh, give me a break.
That can't be the best line
you can come up with.
- I'm making conversation with her.
- No, Sean, I do not come here very often.
Ready?
Hey.
Look at all this schist.
- What?
- It's a metamorphic rock.
Green schist, garnet schist,
mica-garnet schist.
- Oh. Schist.
- It's everywhere, look at it. I guess...
Trevor.
HANNAH: Get to the wall, Trevor.
TREVOR: I can't.
- I can't, the walls widen out down here.
- Your rope is caught on mine.
You're gonna take us down.
I gotta cut you loose.
TREVOR: What?
- Hannah, no.
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.
- Don't.
TREVOR: Don't, don't, don't.
- Uncle Trevor.
- Ah!
Hey, guys, found it.
The bottom's right here.
Hey, Hannah, you knew that, right?
Right?
Hannah?
Guys, what's this?
TREVOR: Looks like
an abandoned mine tunnel to me.
That's Old Bla'gils Mine.
It was shut down 60 years ago
after the big disaster.
Disaster?
How big?
Eighty-one dead.
That's pretty big.
Come on.
Cowboy up.
SEAN: Hey, Trevor,
was there a mine like this in the book?
TREVOR:
No, don't think so.
- Hannah?
HANNAH: Yup?
TREVOR:
Can I ask you something?
Do you wonder if your father
and my brother weren't wrong?
Let me make something very clear
to you.
I am not my father.
And the world that he belonged to
has nothing to do with me.
I understand, of course.
I didn't mean to say that it was
or that it would be...
- You know I'm still on the clock, right?
- You're still billing me?
I bill you until I'm safe in my house.
- Huh.
SEAN: Hannah?
What's that?
- This is the old generator for the mine.
- Hey, you don't want to touch that.
What are you doing?
There might be some
volatile compounds there, you know.
- Serious generator.
TREVOR: Hannah, that thing could blow up.
Stop throwing switches.
Don't do that. No, wait.
Get away from that thing.
Okay, I take it back.
This is it, right? I mean, the miners,
they had to get their stuff out somewhere.
TREVOR: Yeah.
SEAN: These tracks could lead us out.
Hey, Hannah, how many miners got out?
One.
That's a start. I call front.
What? No, no, no.
Come on, don't get in there.
We don't even know
if these things work.
They're not safe.
The tracks might not be safe.
Track ahead looks good. Get in.
Hey, Sean, it doesn't look safe.
I wouldn't do that.
I think I see something. It's...
Please tell me it's daylight.
Otherwise, I don't wanna know.
Uh...
No, it's not daylight.
Oh, we're in deep schist.
I wish there were seat belts
on this thing.
You're worried about seat belts?
- Whoa!
HANNAH: Ah!
Watch it.
- Hannah.
- I know.
- Pull the brake, pull the brake.
- No, don't.
We won't make it.
Yeah.
Hey, great job. Thanks.
SEAN: Guys.
TREVOR: Stay put, Sean.
Trevor, you okay?
Hannah, your track ends.
Jump in my car.
What?
Quick, you have to do it.
- Just jump.
- I know that.
Ready? Ah!
Trevor, your track ends too.
- Okay.
- What are you doing?
Showing the proper way
to save someone's life. Come on.
- Can I help?
- Okay.
Ready?
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Luckily, I had a soft landing.
That's two you owe me now.
- Who's keeping count?
- I am.
That was awesome.
- What happened to you guys?
- Don't ask.
What's that?
TREVOR:
Where are you going? Don't go in there.
SEAN: What are you guys talking about?
This could be our way out.
There's a hole in the wall.
Guys, check it out.
Rubies.
Emeralds.
Feldspar.
Uh, guys, there's more.
Diamonds.
Bling.
Crystals are frequently formed
and found...
...in volcanic tubes.
This tube could take us back up, right?
- Uh-huh.
- We're not far from the surface.
- Uh-uh.
- When we get out, I'm getting a Maserati.
Money is not the only thing that matters,
Sean. People matter too, you know.
- Something like that.
SEAN: Not if you have a Maserati.
Did you guys hear that?
Nobody move.
Tell me that's not what I think it is.
Muscovite.
Muscovite.
What's muscovite?
- Muscovite is a thin type of rock formation.
- How thin?
Well, so thin that the slightest change
in weight and pressure...
...can cause it to shatter.
And we're standing on a lot of it.
Just stop. Stop.
Okay, they're stopped.
I need you to walk back
exactly the way we came from.
Very, very calmly, okay?
TREVOR:
Tread lightly.
Heel, toe. Doing good.
HANNAH:
Doing great. Very slowly.
Good. Come on.
That's it.
That's great.
- Really careful.
- Keep going.
No!
It's actually thicker than I thought.
We're still falling!
Trevor, what's at the bottom?
Well, if what Verne wrote was right...
...these tunnels could go for hundreds,
thousands of miles.
Verne was not right.
Trevor, finish. What's at the bottom?
Most likely theory is that it just ends.
Ends? Got any other theories?
Well, the walls of this tunnel
could have gently eroded...
...by water which still runs through it...
...providing a gradual break to our fall.
- Kind of like a water slide.
- Water slide.
Okay, that's a theory.
But wouldn't the water have formed
stalagmites pointing straight up at us?
- We'll be skewered.
- That is also possible.
Is that water?
Yes. Water.
Water slide, water slide.
Here it comes. Hang on.
Sean! Sean!
Sean, Sean, you all right?
We didn't get skewered.
Make for the rocks.
Where's Hannah?
Hannah! Hannah!
My backpack was too heavy.
Thank you.
So where does that put us now?
Back to one.
Guys, where are we?
Are those stars?
TREVOR:
No.
That's just the ceiling of the cave.
Is it just me, or is the cave ceiling...
...moving?
Yeah.
It does look like it...
...doesn't it?
They're birds.
Electric birds?
TREVOR:
They look like
Only they're bioluminescent,
like fireflies or glowworms.
It's incredible.
SEAN:
Cool.
Glow... birds.
Have you seen
these creatures before?
Yeah, in the museum,
but they were fossilized.
These things have been extinct
for over 150 million years.
HANNAH: Where are they going?
TREVOR: Hey, a tunnel.
SEAN:
Guys, come on.
HANNAH:
Sean, wait. Wait for me.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the center of the Earth.
Max was right.
He was right.
Max was right!
Your dad was right.
He was right.
Hannah, your dad was right too.
TREVOR:
They both believed...
...in something
that everyone told them was impossible.
He was right.
- What's that light up there?
TREVOR: I can't tell.
It must be some sort
of luminescent gas combination.
I don't know.
It's like a terrarium.
A terrarium thousands of miles
beneath the crust of the Earth.
A world within the world.
"The waterfalls, which for a long time,
could be heard flowing from afar...
...now cascaded along
the towering canyon walls...
...streaming along the rock
with no end."
I mean,
it's the same thing Liedenbrock wrote.
Are we saying that Liedenbrock
the character was real?
That he existed?
Someone came down here.
Someone saw all this.
Someone got out
and someone told Verne.
Somebody got out?
That's the best thing I've heard all day.
Doesn't this
just completely blow your mind?
My mind is blown, yes.
TREVOR:
Enormous fossilized mushrooms.
SEAN:
Sort of like humongous fungus.
- Everything in the book is real?
- Probably.
- And the really dangerous parts?
- I was thinking about that too.
Right.
SEAN:
Trevor, come quick.
- Sean?
- Sean?
- I'm going in.
- Yeah, wait up.
Hey, slow down.
HANNAH:
I'll be right there.
SEAN:
Someone actually lived here?
That somebody...
...was Liedenbrock.
Look at all his gear.
All this, state of the art...
...a century ago.
Hey, Trevor.
I think I found Liedenbrock's notebook.
Look.
Looks like on the other side of those trees
there's some sort of underground ocean.
Yeah.
I don't think
that's Liedenbrock's handwriting.
It's my dad's.
HANNAH:
Trevor?
Trevor?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Out here.
TREVOR:
Can you wait here for a minute?
HANNAH:
Hey, I think I found Max.
I never really got a chance to know him.
I mean, I wish I did.
He wrote something
and I want you to hear it.
"August 14, 1997.
Today was Sean's third birthday.
Six weeks ago, I promised myself
I would be home in time...
...to give him his first baseball glove.
Now I'm worried...
...that I'll never get the chance.
I set out to make an incredible discovery
to share with Trevor and the world.
But now, I would trade it all...
...just to be able to watch you grow up...
...to be the brave and caring man...
...I am certain you will become.
Happy birthday, Sean.
I love you.
Daddy."
Goodbye, Max.
Come on.
TREVOR:
According to Max's journal...
...we're here in this giant air pocket
that's surrounded by lava.
And during periods
of intense seismic activity...
- Like the one we're in now.
- That's right.
- the magma that surrounds us...
...turns this place
into pretty much just a big oven.
Was that what happened to my dad?
Look, I know I'm just a kid,
but I can handle this, really.
Sit down.
Max was planning an escape.
His notes say that temperatures down here
can easily hit 200 degrees.
TREVOR: A human being can't survive
beyond 135.
- It's already 95 degrees.
- It was 82 when we got here.
- Temperature's rising quickly.
- So, what do we do?
I say that we follow Max's plan.
HANNAH:
Here's what he wrote:
"My analysis of the original Verne text...
...leads me to believe that across the ocean
due north of my current position...
...is a geyser-like river which could be used
to return to the surface."
TREVOR: So, what we have to do
is get across this ocean...
...and find the geyser
and just hitch a ride topside.
Topside sounds good.
It's a little trickier than that.
It could get so hot
that the water'll evaporate.
How much time do we have?
Forty-eight hours. Seventy-two, tops.
Probably less.
Okay, so the question is:
What is the fastest way
to get across the ocean?
There's no way we can get around it,
because if we hike...
HANNAH:
Oh, we don't have time.
There's no time to do that.
SEAN:
It's all in the book.
TREVOR:
Hey, you all right?
What's the temperature doing?
HANNAH:
It is a hundred degrees.
TREVOR: Eat your trilobite, Sean.
We gotta keep our strength up.
Attaboy.
SEAN:
Hey.
Don't we need a center mast?
No. We don't need it.
The wind that we want is way up there.
Thermal. It's a lot faster
than what we got down here.
Good job. That should just about do it.
Hey, I got something for you.
SEAN: What is this?
TREVOR: It's a compass.
It was your dad's.
I remember the Christmas
that your mom gave it to him.
She wanted to make sure
that he could always find a way back home.
And maybe it will help you
find a way back to her.
- Thanks, Trevor.
- You got it.
- It means a lot to me.
- Me too.
Oh, there's one thing you should know.
Down here, the polarity is reversed.
I mean, north is south, south is north...
...and we need to bear due north
across the sea.
You mean, south.
Exactly.
All right, it's starting to pick up now.
Okay, hold it. Hold it really steady.
Good, good, good.
- Good. Ready?
SEAN: Yeah.
Three, two, one, go!
- Yeah.
SEAN: All right.
Yeah. All right.
TREVOR:
Yeah.
Go, go, go.
Yeah. Keep going.
Whoa, we're going, we're going.
Hey, well, can you wait for me?
HANNAH: Well, get on.
SEAN: Come on, come on, let's go.
He's back.
Hey, little guy.
Seen those clouds?
Yeah.
The current's pulling us in the direction
we wanna go. We should lower the kite.
Can't do that.
It's a hundred and nine degrees.
It's getting hotter.
We need all the speed we can get.
Leave it up.
It's just a little storm.
Ain't no big deal.
Something moving down there.
TREVOR:
Phosphorous and plankton.
It's the same thing we saw
back at the beach.
I don't know.
It looks kind of big for plankton.
Sean, we're not at SeaWorld,
so back off a little bit.
- All right?
- I think it's some sort of fish.
SEAN:
No.
They're everywhere.
Sean, I told you
we'd get to the batting cage.
Batter up.
SEAN:
Okay. Let's see what you've got.
Yeah. Line drive.
- Sean!
- Do you hear something?
- Hello?
ELIZABETH:
- Mom?
-
Mom, I can't hear you.
Uncle Trevor and I, uh...
...we're sort of on a fishing trip and...
Whoa, no, you don't.
- Uncle Trevor just caught a really big one.
-
- My phone.
- Sean, do you know how to switch hit?
- Ready?
SEAN: Yeah.
Out of the ball park.
- Sean.
- Look out.
I got it, I got it.
HANNAH: Sean.
TREVOR: No, no, don't.
Get away from the sides.
Look what they're doing.
They don't want us. They want the fish.
Listen up.
Sean, you take the tiller, we'll get the line.
Hannah, hold the slack.
Sean, you wanna take us hard starboard?
What?
That way.
SEAN:
Come on.
- Okay.
TREVOR: Doing good.
Now just let it out gently.
Let it out gently.
Let it out slowly.
SEAN:
It's working.
We're pulling clear of them.
You're the man, Uncle Trev.
That's what I've been telling
the scientific community for years.
TREVOR:
Hannah.
Let me see.
The lines.
SEAN: Got it.
TREVOR: Sean.
Sean, don't do that. No, Sean.
Sean!
- No, Sean!
- Trevor!
- Sean!
TREVOR: Hang on!
Don't let go!
No.
Trevor?
Trevor?
Hello?
Hello?
Hey, little guy. Where are we?
Hey, do you know
where I can get some water?
I'm talking to a bird.
I must be losing it.
TREVOR:
Sean!
Sean!
Wait.
The wind blew him this way.
We still heading north?
Yeah, still north.
He's a smart kid. He knows the plan.
I'm sure he'll be waiting by the river.
Let's find that river.
Hey, come on, wait up.
Where'd you go?
Good job.
Okay.
Now which way?
South.
That's good.
The river's north.
Okay.
Here, let me take that.
- No, no, I'm fine.
- Come on, let me take it.
- Trevor, I'm fine.
- Hannah, Hannah, I got it.
Let's just stop for a second.
Hey, we're gonna find him.
Drink that.
- Is that the last of the water?
- Yeah.
We're gonna need that. Keep it.
Hannah, drink it.
Come on.
Duck!
- What the...?
HANNAH: What was that?
Large carnivorous plant?
Hannah.
Hannah?
Hannah.
Hannah.
Hannah.
Ugh.
Hang in there.
That's one point for me, right?
Right.
Who's keeping track, right?
I get it.
It's a magnetic field.
No way.
Magnetic rocks?
No, no. No, no, no.
No. No.
You try that without wings.
That's the river.
Geyser must be inside that cave.
Sean!
Where is he?
Where is he?
Trevor?
Trevor?
Man, I really wish I'd read that book.
I don't see him anywhere.
Trevor? Trevor.
Hang on a minute. What are you doing?
I'm going to get my nephew.
Hannah.
This is all my fault.
Save yourself.
Just go home.
I'll wait for you at the river...
...for as long as I can.
What did you do that for?
Just in case.
TREVOR:
Sean!
Sean!
Sean!
Sean?!
Sean!
Sean!
Sean! Sean!
Come on!
Oh, God, I'm glad to see you.
Yeah, you too.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
We should go.
SEAN:
Wait, wait, wait.
- Is that the geyser?
- Yeah, that's where we're going.
Come on.
- Haven't you ever seen a dinosaur before?
- Not with skin on it.
He's too fast. We're not gonna make it.
- Trevor, what are you doing?
- That's muscovite.
Same thing that we fell through before.
SEAN:
There's no way it's gonna hold you.
It can't hold him either. Now you run.
Trevor, no.
It's not breaking, Trevor.
Keep running!
- He's gaining on you.
- I know.
Keep going.
Ah! Whoa.
SEAN:
Trevor, it's working.
Look out!
Trevor!
I just remembered something.
I hate field work.
Trevor, come on.
That was like... And then you were like...
Yeah, I know. I'm really lucky.
Okay, that way.
That, no good. That, worse.
Let's go.
The river.
How are we gonna get to the geyser?
- Water's boiling.
- We need something that floats.
Anything. I could use a log or...
What we really need is a boat.
Who had dibs again?
Come on, jump in.
- The best mountain guide on the planet.
- Got that right.
You didn't really think
you were gonna scare me away, did you?
You'll have to work harder than that.
I'm afraid I'll have to charge you extra
for this bit.
TREVOR:
Can I open a tab? Whoa.
What was that?
It's not good. That's the river bed.
We're running out of water.
Well, guys,
you might wanna hang on to something.
This ride is about to get a little bit...
Bumpy.
- Is everybody all right?
HANNAH: Yeah.
SEAN:
Where are we?
What's that light down there?
TREVOR:
That's lava.
It's magma, and it's rising.
There's supposed to be water in this tunnel.
Steam, water shooting up.
We're too late for the geyser,
we missed it.
- What do we do?
- Do you have any suggestions, professor?
Without water, no steam.
Without steam, we're not going anywhere.
This place looks like there hasn't been
water here in two, three hours now.
- But the walls are still wet.
- That's impossible, it's 130 degrees.
- Trevor. Behind you.
- What?
It is wet.
It's cold. There's water behind here.
There's gotta be water behind some pocket
or underground river.
Trevor, it's getting closer.
Hey, that's magnesium.
- We're slipping.
- How many flares you got left?
Three.
What do you wanna do with them?
Gonna light the magnesium. On purpose.
Hang on.
Oh, come on. It's too wet.
Got to get further down.
Give me another one.
Hold my legs.
Come on.
You're gonna have to tie me off.
I gotta get down lower.
Trevor, it's getting closer.
That's good. All right, ready.
It's the last one.
Trevor, be careful.
HANNAH: How's that?
TREVOR: Little more.
SEAN:
Hurry.
HANNAH: Lower?
TREVOR: Little more.
Okay, hold off.
- Come on.
SEAN: Come on.
TREVOR: Come on, light.
SEAN: Come on.
Come on, Trevor.
Still wet. Gonna have to
throw it to the other side.
What?
No.
No!
HANNAH:
Trevor, come on.
- Trevor, come on.
- It's lit, it's lit.
Pull!
- Pull me up.
- Hurry.
Pull me up. Pull me up.
HANNAH: Come on, pull it. Pull it.
TREVOR: Pull.
Watch the teeth. Watch the teeth.
HANNAH:
Sean! Come on!
Get down, it's gonna blow.
This thing's heating up.
I know!
- Hang on!
- Trust me, I'm hanging on!
Is that sky?
Hang on, everybody!
- Stop saying that!
- It just keeps coming up!
That's Mount Vesuvius.
Hey, Sean, if your mom asks you
what you did this weekend...
...you tell her Uncle Trevor took you to Italy.
- Italy?
Sean?
Sean?
What? I just took
a few geological samples.
A few geological samples?
A few pounds of samples, but what
do you expect? I'm a scientist's son.
Look. Look.
You take this.
You take. We are sorry.
You want slide again?
Slide is okay. It's fine.
Anything what you want.
What was that for?
Now we're even.
Leonard, I'm back.
Stop doing what you're doing.
What am I doing?
Oh, look, you're looking for work.
You don't need to,
because you have a job...
...with the Ásgeirsson-Anderson Institute
for Tectonophysical Exploration.
The Ásgeirsson-Anderson... What?
Still working on the name.
But the point is, rising tide lifts all boats.
Man, that's awesome.
I think... Am I a boat?
- You're a boat. We're back in business.
- All right, dude.
Well, well, well.
What's all the excitement about?
- Oh, hey, Alan. How are you?
ALAN: Good.
- What you doing?
- Oh, me?
I'm moving into my new lab.
More importantly, where have you been?
I heard you missed your Monday lecture
and both of your students complained.
Oh!
I took a quick vacation.
Best thing I could've done.
ALAN:
That is exciting.
You'll have to promise
to tell me about it, okay?
Not sure if I'll have time, but you can read
about it in
Look, I just want to say,
no hard feelings, okay?
About the laboratory moving
and expansion thing.
So I'm actually looking
for my own building anyway.
How exactly
are you going to do that, Trevor?
Well, let's just say
I fell into a small fortune.
HANNAH: So tomorrow
you're gonna be a Canadian.
Yep. Looks that way.
I'd say that was a lot of male bonding
packed into very little time.
What do you say
we take a couple weeks next time?
A couple weeks?
- What are you doing over Christmas break?
- Nothing. I'm free.
I just found this in your dad's stuff.
Give it a read.
-
TREVOR: Mm-hm.
We'll talk.
Sean, what is that?
- I'm just feeding my pet.
- What pet?
Sean.
- You think my mom will let me keep him?
- I don't know.
Might not even stay here.
- Look at it.
- Hey, come on.
- This is your problem.
- Where are you going?
I got some food for you. Come on.
Come back down here.
Come on.
