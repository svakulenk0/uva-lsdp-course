MAN:
New Yorkers, a season high,
seven inches of rain last night.
High winds and flooding in some areas
even left some New Yorkers stranded.
They're trying to restore power
to several areas in the boroughs.
Good news is, today should be
sunny with highs in the low 60s.

HELEN:
-
-
JOHN:
MARCUS: It's been a while.
My condolences.
How're you holdin' up?
I keep asking "Why her?"
There's no rhyme or reason to this life.
It's days like today
scattered among the rest.
- Are you sure?
- Don't blame yourself.
What are you really doing here, Marcus?
Just checkin' up on an old friend.
Goodbye, John.
- John Wick?
- Yes.
Sign here, please.
And the pen.
Sorry.
- Here you go. Good night.
- Thanks.
HELEN: "John, I'm sorry
I can't be there for you.
"But you still need something,
someone, to love.
"So start with this.
Because the car doesn't count.
"I love you, John. This illness
has loomed over us for a long time,
"and now that I have found
my peace, find yours.
"Until that day,
your best friend, Helen."
Hey.
Hey.
Daisy.
Of course.
Hey.
Come on.
- I'm up. I'm up...
-
I'm up. I'm up.
Hey!
Oh. Right.
What?
We'll grab you some kibble later.
Nice ride.
Mustang. Boss 429.
-  She a '70?
- '69.
Huh.
Beautiful car.
Thanks.
- How much?
- Excuse me?
How much for the car?
She's not for sale.
Oh, I love dogs.
-
-
You have good day, sir.
-
-
-
-
All right, come on, then.
How you doin'?
You need to go?
-
-
-
-
Uh-huh.
-
-
-
-
Yo, Aurelio!
-
- Ah?
I want a new VIN number
and some clean papers.
Where'd you get that car?
Is it here?
It was.
- I asked you where the hell did you get it?
- Who gives a shit?
AURELIO:
Viggo's son.
Yeah.
All right, get out of here. Just get
out of my shop. Get out right now.
Did you just lose your shit, Aurelio?
Because we own you.
What did you say?
What did you say to me?
We own you.
You don't own me, punk.
I work with your father, all right?
The owner of that car,
did you kill him or what?
No. I sure as hell fucked up his dog.
You fucked up his dog? That's what
you did? You fucked up his dog?
-  Yeah...
- That's crazy shit, man.
Aw, look at you. That's great.
You're gonna come into my shop
and you're gonna pull a gun on me.
That's great, man. Come on!
Now, either you kill me right now
or you get the fuck outta my shop!
Viggo is not gonna like this.
How do you know what
Viggo likes or doesn't like?
I'll tell you somethin'
he's gonna understand.
You've got a fuckin'
pair on you, old man!
I guess we'll be takin' our
business someplace else.
AURELIO:
I need a ride.
-
-
Aurelio speaking.
VIGGO: I heard you struck my son.
- AURELIO:
- And may I ask why?
Yeah. Well, because he stole
John Wick's car, sir.
And, uh...
killed his dog.
Oh.
Viggo?
Yeah?
They've agreed to your terms.
I mean, it's not like you gave them
much of a choice anyway, though, right?
Congratulations.
Sir?
Have you seen my son?
How was your trip, kid?
We won't be hearing
from them anytime soon.
Or ever.
That's a nice jacket.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
-
-
Should I go?
- Viggo, English, please. Come on...
- Stay, God damn it!
- IOSEF: What did I do?
-
IOSEF: We did what you asked.
No one saw shit.
I'm not talking about Atlantic City.
What, then?
You mean Aurelio's?
So I stole a fucking car!
Aw, fuck, Viggo!
- Right, I'll go...
- You stay!
It's not what you did, son,
that angers me so.
- It's who you did it to.
- Who? The fucking nobody!
That fuckin' nobody...
is John Wick.
They call him Baba Yaga.
- The Boogeyman?
- Well, John wasn't exactly The Boogeyman.
He was the one you sent to
kill the fucking Boogeyman.
Oh.
VIGGO: John is a man of focus,
commitment,
sheer will.
Something you know very little about.
I once saw him kill three men in a bar.
With a pencil.
With a fuckin'...
...pencil.
Then suddenly one day he asked to leave.
It's over a woman, of course.
I gave him an impossible task.
A job no one could have pulled off.
The bodies he buried that day
laid the foundation of what we are now.
And then, my son,
a few days after his wife died,
you steal his car
and kill his fuckin' dog.
Father, I can make this right.
Oh...
- How do you plan that?
- By finishing what I started.
- What the... Did he hear a fucking word I said?
-
Iosef! Iosef! Listen!
Huh?
John will come for you.
And you will do nothing,
because you can do nothing.
So get the fuck out of my sight!
VIGGO:
I heard about your wife, and I'm sorry.
My condolences.
John?
Let us not resort to our baser instincts
-
-
AVI: What'd he say?
- Enough.
-  Oh, God.
Task your crew.
-  How many?
- How many do you have?
-
-
- Evenin', John.
- Evenin', Jimmy.
Noise complaint?
Noise complaint.
- You, uh, workin' again?
- No, just sortin' some stuff out.
Ah, well...
I'll leave you be, then.
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Jimmy.
This is Wick.
Yes, John Wick, that's right.
I'd like to make a dinner
reservation for 12.
Good to see you, John.
JOHN: Charlie.
You look good.
And here I'd feared
you'd left all this behind.
Will I be hearin' from you anytime soon?
Goodbye, Charlie.
John.
Of course he did.
Put a contract on John Wick.
- How much?
- Two million.
English, Viggo, please.
Put Iosef in the Red Circle and wait.
For what?
For John Wick, of course.
Thank you.
MARCUS: To what do I owe this visit?
I have a job for you.
And I've got a phone.
Hmm.
I want to offer you this face to face
seeing as how you
might find it personal.
Would you kill John Wick
for two million dollars?
After all, you were close.
- Is the contract exclusive?
- No, it's open.
It's a timely matter,
it has to be handled quickly.
Consider it done.
Thank you, Marcus.
I know I can trust you.
Thanks for the drink.
- CHARON: Room 918. Do enjoy your stay.
- Thanks.
Good seeing you again, John.
Perkins.
I have you for two nights.
- Depending on business, it may be more.
- Of course, sir.
So when did the old place
get a facelift?
Around four years ago.
But I assure you, sir,
she really hasn't changed much.
- Same owner?
- Same owner.
Room 818.
And, as always,
it is a pleasure having you
with us again, Mr. Wick.
HELEN:
JOHN:
-
-
Hello, Winston.
Jonathan.
Now, as I recall,
weren't you the one tasked to dole out
the beatings, not receive them?
Rusty, I guess.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
Iosef Tarasov.
- What about him?
- I'd like to talk with him.
A talk, you say.
I'm familiar with
the parlance, Jonathan.
I want to ask you this.
Have you returned to the fold?
Just visiting.
Have you thought this through?
I mean, chewed down to the bone?
You got out once.
You dip so much as a pinky
back into this pond,
you may well find something reaches out
and drags you back into its depths.
Where do I find him?
AVI: Hey.
Wick's at The Continental.
Welcome home, John.
We have a contact there who's
willing to take him out for us.
Yeah?
How brazen.
If they're willing to break the rules
of Continental, double the bounty.
You know the rules.
No business can be conducted
on these premises lest
incurring heavy penalties.
Have a drink
and relax.
For now.
It's personal.
Holy shit! Jonathan!
- Hey, Addy.
- My God!
- How long has it been? Four years?
- Five and change.
So tell me, how was
life on the other side?
It was good, Addy.
Far better than I deserved.
- Hey, I'm sorry to hear about your...
- Thanks.
I've never seen you like this.
Like what?
Vulnerable.
- I'm retired.
- Not if you're drinkin' here, you're not.
- Usual?
- Please.
Compliments of the house.
Thanks.
Did you see the tits on that girl?
Better hope Lita is working tonight.
Are you scared of the fuckin' boogeyman?
- I'm not.
- No.
But you should be.
I want another bottle!
Right fuckin' now! Go get me a bottle!
Come on!
Hello, Francis.
- Mr. Wick.
-
Are you here on business, sir?
Afraid so, Francis.
Why don't you take the night off.
Thank you, sir.
-
-
Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Where is Iosef?
-
Bath house, downstairs.
-
-
- Go!
-
John Wick's there. Go get him!
Move! He's here! He's fucking here!
He's there! He's coming!
-
-
Get in! Get in!
Come on, come on!
- CHARON: Good evening, Mr. Wick.
- Good evening.
- How may I be of service?
- Is the doctor in?
- Yes, sir. 24/7.
- Then send him up, please.
- Yes, sir.
- How good's your laundry?
I'm sorry to say that
no one's that good.
No. I thought not.
May I suggest a drink, sir.
Bourbon, perhaps.
That sounds perfect.
So what sort of movement
am I looking at?
Well, if you're lookin' to heal,
then keep it marginal.
- However, if you still have...
-
-
- ...business to attend to,
take two of these beforehand.
Your stitches'll tear and you'll bleed,
but you'll have full function.
Do you need anything for the pain?
No, I've got that covered.
Hey, John.
- Perkins?
- I thought I'd let myself in.
I noticed.
I never knew Ms. Perkins to get
out of bed for less than three.
Viggo's giving me four
to break hotel rules.
- That's unwise, I assure you.
-
You were always a pussy.
-
-
-
-
Yes?
CHARON: I apologize for
calling you at this hour, but...
we have received a number of grievances
from your floor concerning the noise.
My apologies. I was dealing with...
- an uninvited guest.
a dinner reservation, perhaps?
JOHN:
Perhaps. I'll have to get back to you.
No!
- Where's Iosef?
- Fuck you.
- Where's Viggo?
- I'm not telling you shit!
Do you really wanna die here, Perkins?
Give me somethin'.
Little Russia.
There's a church near Cannon Court.
- JOHN:
- PERKINS:
It's where Viggo keeps
his private stash.
Thank you.
MAN: Do I know you?
I'm thinkin' so.
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Harry.
Everything all right?
Yeah. Everything's fine.
- I'll leave you to it, then.
- Hey, Harry?
You keen on earning a coin?
Babysittin' the sleepin' one?
- Catch and release?
- Catch and release.
My son, how might I help you?
Motherfucker!
- Let's go to the vault.
-
-
-
- Open it.
-
Viggo will kill me.
Uh-huh.
Ladies, out.
Honestly, what do you think you're
going to do with all of that?
- This.
-
- HARRY: Don't worry.
-
Housekeeping will find you.
Treat all your ladies like this?
You are no lady. Trust me.
Harry, is it?
How'd you like to earn more
than just a gold coin?
You've broken the rules. You've done
business on Continental grounds.
And management does not take
kindly to that sort of behavior.
Fuck management.
Don't worry. Housekeeping will find you.
Ashes to ashes.
Can we recover from this?
Viggo, you know what
was in that vault, right?
It was nothing.
Shit!
Come on!
VIGGO: I'll say this, John.
They sure as fuck broke
the mold with you.
Ay, ay...
You always had a certain...
...audacity about you, you know.
Right? Oh, yeah.
I can say you're still very
much the John Wick of old.
Am I?
People don't change. You know that.
Times, they do.
Do you know what was in that vault?
Artwork, cash, not without its worth,
but the leverage I had on this city,
audio recordings, physical evidence,
blackmail, it was fuckin' priceless!
Priceless!
Yeah. I kind of enjoyed that.
Yeah, I know you did. Yeah.
- Are you really laughing?
-
So...
Then you got married, ah? Settled down.
How did you manage that anyways?
Luck, I guess.
Yeah.
Yeah, while you had your wife,
I had my son.
And believe me,
you had a far better deal.
And then you left.
And the way you got out,
lying to yourself that the past
held no sway over the future.
But in the end,
a lot of us are rewarded
for our misdeeds,
which is why God took your wife
and unleashed you upon me.
This life...
follows you.
It clings to you,
infecting everyone who
comes close to you.
We are cursed, you and I.
On that we agree.
Finally, common ground.
- Okay.
- Step aside.
Give me your son.
John Wick.
It was just a fucking car!
Just a fuckin' dog!
Just a dog...
Viggo?
- Yeah.
- When Helen died, I lost everything.
Until that dog arrived on my doorstep.
A final gift from my wife.
In that moment, I received
some semblance of hope.
An opportunity to grieve unalone.
And your son
took that from me!
- Oh, come on...
- Stole that from me!
Killed that from me!
People keep asking if I'm back.
And I haven't really had an answer.
But now, yeah, I'm thinkin' I'm back!
- So you can either hand over your son...
-
...or you can die
screaming alongside him!
-
-
Cool it, cool it, cool it,
cool it, cool it!
John!
- Where is he?
- Shit.
Shit!
I have your word that
if I tell you where he is,
- you'll let me walk away?
- Pull the contract.
Done.
He's kept in a safe house. Brooklyn.
- They know you're coming.
- Of course. But it won't matter.
Will you stop playing
the fucking video game?
Will you stop playing
that fucking video game?
Get down, get down!
Come on, come on! Get down, get down!
-
-
Make the arrangements.
Thank you.
Our pleasure, sir.
A parting gift. From the management.
Compensation for last
night's unfortunate...
incident.
MARCUS: How many times
do I have to save your ass?
- JOHN: I appreciate it.
- MARCUS: Of course.
- You look terrible.
- No, I look retired.
Retired? You really believe that?
- You made a new life.
-
You'll find your way back to it.
It's time to go home.
Let's get on with this,
whatever the fuck this is.
VIGGO: Hello, Marcus.
This is John.
I appreciate you granting
my son a swift death.
I wouldn't know how
to reply to that either.
Marcus betrayed me.
- You pulled the contract.
- And while it was open,
you had every chance,
every opportunity to kill John Wick.
And if you had done your job,
my son would be still alive!
And in so doing,
he broke the cardinal rule.
Thank you.
Ms. Perkins.
Why am I not surprised?
In for a penny, in for a pound.
VIGGO:
I always liked you, Marcus.
The last of the old guard.
Oh.
But unlike the others,
you go out on my terms.
God! No!
No, my good sir.
I go out on my own.
See?
Well played, old friend.
AVI: We done, Viggo?
- We're done.
- Okay. Here.
- Thank you.
-
Yeah. Fuel the chopper.
CHARON: Ms. Perkins, I apologize
for calling you at this hour.
Ms. Perkins,
your membership to the Continental
has been, by thine own hand,
revoked.
WINSTON:
Which is why I'm not the one
telling you that a certain helicopter
at a certain helipad is being
fueled for a certain someone.
- Have you got my cigarettes?
- Yeah, I got your cigarettes.
AVI: Oh, fuck!
Yeah. Super. Come on, let's go. Faster!
The helicopter's right down there.
Come on! Let's go!
- Shit!
-
Goddamn, I knew he'd come.
What's fuckin' wrong with this guy?
Somebody give me a gun. Who's got a gun?
- Oh, God!
-
- That was a good one.
- Who's got a gun?
- AVI: Fuck!
-
Viggo, the helicopters, right over there.
We have to get over there.
Ah!
Oh, my God, I need a gun.
- English, please.
- Good luck.
Russian cocksucker.
Ah!
Fuck!
No!
VIGGO: No more guns, John.
No more bullets.
No more bullets.
Just you and me, John.
You and me.
What happened, John?
We were professionals. Civilized.
Do I look civilized to you?
-
-
Be seeing you, John.
Yeah.
Be seeing you.
HELEN:
It's okay.
Let's go home.
