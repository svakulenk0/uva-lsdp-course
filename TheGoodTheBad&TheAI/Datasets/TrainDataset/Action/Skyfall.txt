- Oh, the drive is gone.
- Are you sure?
It's gone.
Give me a minute.
They must have it.
Get off to them.
- I'm stabilizing Ronson.
- We don't have the time.
- I have to stop the bleeding.
- Leave him!
- What about Ronson.
- He's been hit.
I'm sending an emergency
evacuation squad.
Medical evacuation, for Ronson,
five minutes way.
It's all right?
You'll wait using it.
Keep going.
I can direct you from here.
We both know
what's at stake here.
We cannot afford
to lose that list.
They're on the top roof
of the grand bazaar.
Take the left, there's a bridge.
You can cut him off.
- What happened?
- They're on the train, ma' am.
What do you mean
on the train?
I mean they're on the top
of the train.
Well, get off to them,
for God's sake.
We've lost tracking.
We are blind here.
- What's going on?
- I'm still with them.
There is CCTV satellite,
end of it.
- 007, are you alright?
- Just changing carriages.
What's going on?
Report!
It's rather hard
to explain, ma'am.
This side here isn't much more road.
I do not think I can go any further.
Repeat.
I did not have a clean shot.
There's a tunnel ahead.
I'm going to lose them.
- Can you get into a better position?
- Negative. There's no time.
Well, I can't.
I may get Bond.
It's like going
into the headmaster study.
It's new chairman's
just a standard procedure.
Bloody waste of my time,
that's what I'd call it.
I'm sorry to have
to deal with such...
a delicate subject
at our first encounter...
The Prime Minister
is concerned.
You can tell him my operatives
are pursuing every avenue.
Have you considered
pulling up the agents?
Forgive me,
but that sounds like an evasion.
Forgive me,
but why am I here?
Three months ago
you lost the computer drive
containing the identity
of almost every NATO agent
embedded in terrorist organizations
across the globe.
A list which,
in the eyes of our allies,
So, if you'll forgive me,
I think you know why you're here.
How you should call it,
a civilian oversight?
Your country has only
the highest respect for you
and your many years
of service.
When your current posting
is completed,
No, ma'am, I'm here to oversee
the transition period...
leading to your voluntary retirement
in two months' time.
Your successor has yet to be appointed,
so we'll be asking you...
I know I can't do this job
forever.
But I'll be damned if I'm going
to leave the department
- You should leave with dignity.
- Go to hell with dignity.
trying to decrypt
the stolen hard drive.
We are tracing
the encryption signal.
Get to inspect the basis
as soon as possible.
- It's coming from MI6.
- What?
The data back,
it is linking to our network.
Corrupted.
This is behind our firewall.
- We should shut down.
- No, track it.
We have to know
where it's coming from.
Strip the head
and try the source.
How the hell
it entered in our system?
- It is your computer, ma'am.
- Shut it down.
- Don't you recognize the car?
- Madam...
I'm going to find
whoever did this.
Where the hell
have you been?
Get away from it all,
it really lends perspective.
Run out of drink.
Were you awarded, eh?
You should have trusted me
to finish the job.
It was the possibility
of losing you...
or the certainty of losing
all those other agents.
I made the only decision I could
and you know it.
What do you expect,
a bloody apology?
You know the rules of the game.
You've been playing it long enough.
- We both have.
- Maybe too long.
Well, if you believed that,
why did you come back?
Because we are
under attack...
and you know
we need you.
and declared fit
for active service.
You're going to return to duty
when you've passed the tests.
The shower
might be an order.
I'm going home
and change.
Put your things
into storage.
on the death of an unmarried
employee with no next of kin.
Well, you're bloody
will not sleep in here.
They attacked into the
environmental control system
locked out the safety protocols
and have turned on the gas.
Well, that should
have been impossible.
I was told that they have hacked
into our files.
They knew she would be
out of the building.
- Where are we, lieutenant?
- New digs.
The old building was declared
strategically vulnerable.
Their aim is to breach the most secured
computer system in Britain.
So we are at war
with them now.
Some of these tunnels
are dating back to the 18th century.
Quite fascinating,
if it wasn't for the rats.
- When do I see M?
- Tomorrow, you'll see M...
and Mallory too
if you're lucky.
The new chairman of the
Intelligence and Security Committee.
A charming man, I think.
You and him will really going to hit it off.
We've have attempted to trace
the computer message, but...
it was sent by an asymmetrical
security algorithm...
with the chance to signal
all over the globe
through thousands
of different servers.
And now that they've accessed
M's code,
it's only a matter of time before
they are able to decrypt the list.
Q branch has been analyzing pictures.,
But so far, nothing.
General feeling it's probably
something from her past
Perhaps when she was
running things in Hong Kong.
- It is no idea what it all means?
- And you believe that?
The truth is we don't have
a clue of what's on the list...
or what they are trying
to do with it.
You know what?
Let's.
I'd like to start with some
simple words' sensations.
Just tell me the first word
that punch into your head.
For example I might day,
and you might say...
- Agent.
- Provocative.
- Woman.
- Provocatrix.
- Heart.
- Target.
- Bird.
- Sky.
- M.
- Bitch.
- Sunlight.
- Swim.
- Moonlight.
- Dance.
- Murder.
- Employment.
- Country.
- England.
I'm sorry.
Have we met before?
I am the one
who should say "sorry".
There's nonetheless
vital organs.
No enough excitement
in Istanbul?
Temporary suspension
from field work.
- Really?
- Something to do with killing 007.
- Well, you gave it your best shot.
- It was hardly my best shot.
I'm sure
I can survive your best.
Would you do me a favour,
will you?
If they'll do let you back
out there...
I'm assisting Gareth Mallory
in the transition...
and then I'll be back
in the field.
- That's what you want?
- Yes, of course.
- This is not for everyone.
- Ah, 007...
a moving target
is much harder to hit.
Then you better
keep moving.
The whole office goes off in smoke
and that bloody thing survives.
Your interior decorating tips
have always been appreciated, 007.
I hope I haven't miss anything
that P.M. does prattle in line of a crisis.
- Bond.
- Mallory.
I have just been reviewing
Bond's tests.
Seems you passed.
Mind the scheme of your tiff?
You're back
on active service.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- I'll be outside.
- I may have one question.
You have
the perfect way out.
Go and live quietly
somewhere.
Not many field agents
get to live this cleanly.
Do you get out
in the field much?
You don't need to be an operative
to see the obvious.
Look, you've been
seriously injured.
There's no shame in saying
you have lost a step.
The only shame, it would be
not admitting until it's too late.
I'm in, or fire me.
Entirely up to you.
If he says he is ready,
he is ready.
Perhaps
you can't see at all.
What exactly
are you implying?
You are sentimental
about him.
As long as I am the head
of this department,
I'll choose my own
operatives.
We've analyzed
these shrapnel fragments.
You're lucky it wasn't a direct hit.
It would have cut it you in half.
It's a depleted uranium shell.
A military grade.
Hard to get,
extremely expensive
An unknown resident
without country of origin.
Well, luckily I used to have one
or two friends left in the CIA.
They're after him for the Yemeni
ambassador's murder.
Intel is he's going to be in Shanghai
in two days time. Probably a new job.
You have to go there
and wait further instructions.
Find out who he worked for
and who has the list.
- Then, terminate him for Ronson.
- With pleasure.
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?
Report to the new quarter master
for a few documentation.
He hasn't set up sharp yet, but
Tanner will put you two together.
I didn't know
Bond passed the tests.
Always makes me feel
a little melancholy.
A grand whole warship being
ignominiously hold the way to scrap.
Inevitability of time,
don't you think?
I'm your new
Quarter master.
Why, because I'm not wearing
a lab coat?
My complexion
is hardly relevant.
Age is no guarantee
of efficiency.
And youth is no guarantee
of innovation.
Oh, how's it I can do more damage
on my laptop
sitting in my pyjamas before
my first cup of Old Grey
than you could do
in a year in the field.
Every now and then
a trigger has to be pulled.
It is hard to know which
in your pyjamas.
- Q...
- 007.
- Documentation and passport.
- Thank you.
There's a micro dermal sensor
in the grip...
encoded to your palm print,
so only you can fire it.
That's a random killing machine
more than a personal statement.
Standard as your
radio transmitter.
Activated and broadcast
your own location.
Were you expecting
an exploding pen?
We don't really go in
for that anymore.
Good luck out there
on the field.
And please return
the equipment in one piece.
Tanner, he has posted
the first five names.
They're in danger.
Get them out now.
I have got some
new information.
Are not you a little too qualified
to be delivering messages?
It's all part
of the learning curve.
So, whoever stole the list
has already decrypted it.
They posted the first five names
on the web.
- It was only a matter of time.
- That should be the start.
They're posting five more
next week and the week after.
It's some kind of
sadistic game.
Well, I'm going to do some things
the old-fashion way.
Sometimes the old ways
are the best.
Are you putting your life
in my hands again?
Tans, already briefed me
on the list...
raising the tantalizing question
of what you are really doing here.
The official directive
was to help...
You know, Mallory
is not as bad as you think.
You should do
your homework.
Gareth Mallory
was Lieutenant Colonel...
Lieutenant Colonel in Northern
Ireland Herford regiment.
He spent three months
at the hands of the IRA.
So there's more to him
that meets the eye.
- You know the part now.
- Mmh, mmh.
You look beautiful
in that dress.
You could scrub out
about yourself.
It's amazing what one could do
with an extra pair of hands.
Don't like you a little flatten
now and then?
He doesn't like
to take chances.
Good evening, sir.
How may I help you?
I'd like to cash this in,
please.
With compliments
of the house.
Now you can afford
to buy me a drink?
Maybe I could give
a stretch or two.
I guess I got good
- I like this game.
- Why don't we play another?
With lucky old friend
in Shanghai.
I've been waiting to see
who'll redeem the chip.
You made such a gold entrance
into our little drama.
Do I have
a complicated plot?
Who doesn’t appreciate
the occasion of twists?
- Mr...
- Bond. James Bond.
Severing,
so Mr. Bond...
shall we discuss your next
performance with all that drink?
Are your friends
be joining us?
- She's pretty.
- No, no.
Do you like that ass,
don't you think?
Would you mind if I ask you
a business question?
A subject in which
you're well versed.
Only a certain kind of woman
wears a backless dress
with a Beretta .70
strapped to her thigh.
One could never be
too careful when...
a handsome man in tuxedos
carry Walters...
I'm correct in assuming
you'll killed Patrice?
I want to meet
your employer.
Be careful
what you wish for.
Thank you
for the drink...
But ever since
we sat down here
you haven't stop looking
at your bodyguards.
The three of them
have been excessive.
You belonged to one of the houses
when were you, 12?
I can see images
of a way out.
I hope she told
you were in love.
Right, when a woman is afraid
and pretending not to be.
How much do you know
about fear?
- I don't think so.
- Let me try.
- Can you kill him?
- Yes.
- Will you?
- Someone usually dies.
When I leave,
they're going to kill you.
If you survive,
I'm on the Caimira.
Very nice to have met you,
Mr. Bond.
I like you better
without putting you on red.
The controversy surrounding
the Ministry of Defence...
as images of the Hussein
assassination continue to circulate.
We should warn you, some viewers
might find these images disturbing.
Captain Hussein, an MI6 operative
embedded in the Middle East
was one of the five agents exposed
in what is now been considered
the greatest internal security breach
in modern British history.
The Prime Minister continues
to express public support for MI6
while the opposition has taken
the position...
has taken the position where a bunch
of antiquate bloody idiots
are fighting a war we don't understand
and can't possibly win.
Look, three of my agents
are dead already.
Don't you bring me
in politics now.
The Prime Minister
has ordered an enquiry.
Standing in the stocks of midday?
Who is antiquated now?
For Christ sake, listen to yourself.
We are a democracy
and are accountable to the people
we are trying to defend.
We can't keep working
in the shadows.
Whoever is behind this,
whoever is doing it, he knows us.
He comes from
the same place as Bond.
The place you say
doesn't exist.
They abandoned it
almost in the night.
He made them think there was
a leak at the chemical plant.
It is amazing the panic you can
cause with a single computer.
Does he always get
what he wants?
Hello, James.
Welcome.
My grandmother
had an island.
You could walk along
within an hour.
But still it was,
it was a paradise for us.
One summer,
we went for a visit...
and discovered the place
had been infested with rats.
They'd come on a fishing boat
and gorged themselves on coconut.
So, how do you get rid
of the rats on an island?
We buried an whole drum
and changed the lead.
Then we wired the coconut
to the lead as bait...
and the rats will come
for the coconut, and...
They would fall
into the drum.
And after a month
you've trapped all the rats.
Throw the drum
into the ocean?
and they begin
to get hungry.
they start
eating each other...
until there are only two left,
the two survivors.
And then what,
do you kill them? No.
You take them
and release them into the trees.
And now they don't eat
coconut anymore.
You have changed
their nature.
Back then,
I was her favourite.
And you're not nearly
the agent I was.
Barely held together
by your pills, and your drink.
Don't forget my pathetic
love of country.
You're still clinging to your faith
in that old woman
- when all she does is lie to you.
- She never lied lied to me.
- No?
- No.
What do you score on your
maximum ship evaluation?
Did she tell you the psychologist
cleaned you for duty?
- Yes.
- No.
Psychological evaluation, alcohol
and substance addiction indicated.
Pathological rejection
of authority
based on unresolved
childhood trauma.
Subject is not approved
for field duty
and immediate suspension
from service advised.
What is this,
if not betrayal?
She send you off to me,
knowing that you're not ready
Well, she never tied me
to a chair.
Are you sure
this is about her?
You see,
we are last two rats.
We can either
eat each other.
How you're trying to remember
your training now?
What's the regulation
to cover this?
Well, first time
for everything.
What makes you think
this is my first time?
All the physical stuff's so dull.
So dull.
Your knees
must be killing you.
You're living
in the ruins as well.
At least here there are no
old ladies giving orders...
gadgets from those fools
in Q print.
you could pick
your own secret missions...
You destabilize a multinational
by manipulating stocks. Easy.
Interrupt transmission
from a spy satellite over Kabul.
Rig an election in Uganda.
All to the highest bidder.
that couldn't decide what to take
what to leave, what was important.
And this every day reminds me
to focus on the essentials.
There is nothing...
nothing superfluous in my life.
When a thing is redundant,
it is... eliminated.
A particular favourite of yours,
I understand?
Darling,
your love is out here.
Stand up straight,
keep still...
and whatever you do,
don't lose your head.
Time to redeem
your maximum ship scores.
to knock the gloss
from her head.
And just to be sporting,
I'll let you go first.
Let's see
who it's up on top.
Is there any,
any of the old 007 left?
I win.
What do you say to that?
What are you
going to do now?
Take me back to her?
All on your own?
Who says
I'm on my own?
Latest thing
from Q branch.
You are smaller
then I remembered.
Well, as I bet you remember
you were tall.
Strange, for me it feels just...
like yesterday.
- Are you surprised?
- Not particularly.
But then you always were
a slippery one.
Maybe that's why
you liked me so much.
- You flatter yourself.
- No remorse.
They kept for five months
in a room with no air.
And I isn’t protected your secrets.
I protected you.
it was you...
who betrayed me.
My cyanide capsule
in my back lift molar.
Life clamed to me
like a disease.
I needed to look in your eyes
one last time.
you are going to be transferred
to Belmarsh Prison...
where you will be remanded
in custody...
until the Crown prosecution service
deem you fit to stand trial...
Say my name.
Say it.
Your name is on the memorial wall
of the very building you attacked.
Soon, your past will be
as non-existent as your future.
Did you know
what it does to you?
Let's me know what you recover
from its computers.
Has he transmitted the list?
If such, to who.
- I want this resolved.
- Yes, ma'am.
His name is
Tiago Rodriguez.
But he started operating beyond
his brief hacking the Chinese.
The hand over was coming up
and they were hunting him, so...
We should go, ma'am.
Board enquiry begins in 30-minutes.
I want to know
what's on that computer.
Now, looking
at Silva's computer...
it seems to me he's done a number
of slightly unusual things.
It's established
failed saved protocols...
to wipe the memory if there's
any attempt to access certain files.
Only about six people in the world
can program safe guides like that.
Of course there are.
Can you get past them?
Let's see what you got for us...
Mr. Silva.
Looks like overstated code
to consider its true purpose.
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I might have order.
I'd like to begin
the proceedings.
We are gathered today
to adjust some important issues
concerning the future
of our national security.
So you believe your stewards of MI6
during the recent crisis
Well, I believe we have
apprehended the responsible party
undertaking all
the necessary steps
to ensure that the sensitive
information is contained.
I'm not saying
it all gone perfectly, but...
You forgive me for not
putting up the banking.
I find rather difficult to overlook
the monumental security breaches
and dead operatives which you were
singled handily responsible.
He's using a polymorphic engine
to mutate the code.
Whenever I try to gain an access,
it changes.
It's like solving the Rubik's cube
that's fighting back.
Greensborough Road,
it's an old...
tube station
on the metropolitan line.
Can someone tell me how the hell
he got into our system?
I'm on the stairway
of the low isolation.
I can hear you.
I'm looking for you.
I've got him.
Tracking the location.
Enter the next service door
on your right.
If you enter through that door,
you should be in the tube.
Bond, this isn't an escape.
This was years in the planning.
He wanted us to capture him,
he wanted us to access his computers.
Blowing up HQ,
only emergency protocols.
And all we have retrieved
down here.
What it's got planned next
it worries me.
there should be
a service door on your left.
Of course it will.
Put your back into it.
Why don't you come down here
and put your back into it?
We've alerted security.
Police are on the way.
Give us a second.
I'm looking for him.
There's too many people.
I can't see him.
Welcome to rush hour
on the tube.
Something you don't know
much about.
Don't get on the train unless
he's on it. Give us a minute.
- Bond...
- What?
I'm from Safety.
Carry on.
- Where are you?
- Take a wild guess, Q.
He's in disguise, now.
Disguised as a policeman.
Tell Tanner.
Get her out of there.
You overlooked
or chosen to ignore
and consistently,
almost obstinately...
We need to get you to a secured
location immediately, ma'am.
Like hell am I going
to show him my back.
No. Please, Minister.
Proceed.
we still live in the
golden age of espionage,
when human intelligence
was the only resource available.
Well, I find this rather
old-fashioned belief
demonstrates
a reckless disregard for every...
Excuse me, Minister.
I don't mean to interrupt but...
might we actually hear
from the witness?
I won't miss next time,
Mr. Silva.
Not bad, James,
for a physical wreck.
The latest thing
from my local toy store.
irrelevant my department
has become.
Why you we need agents
for Double-O section.
Well, I suppose I see a different
world than you do.
And the truth is that
what I see frightens me.
I'm frightened because our enemies
are not longer known to us.
But look around you,
who do you fear?
Can you see a face,
a uniform, a flag? No.
Our world is not
more transparent now.
That's where we must
do battle.
So, before you declare
us irrelevant, ask yourselves:
My late husband was
a great lover of poetry.
And here today,
I remember this.
which in old days
moved earth and heaven.
One equal temper
of heroic hearts.
007, what the hell
are we doing?
That would be one way
of looking at it.
Too many people are dying
because of me.
If you wants you,
he's going to have to come and get you.
We've been one step behind Silva
from the start.
It's time to get out in front
and change the game.
Just us.
No one else.
I'm tracking the car.
Where are you going?
I got M.
We're about to disappear.
I need you to lay
a trail of breadcrumbs
impossible to follow
for anyone except Silva.
I'm guessing
this isn't strictly official.
So much for my promising
career in espionage.
Well, I'm not hiding in there
if that's your brilliant plan.
The trouble with company cars
is they have trackers.
And I suppose that's completely
inconspicuous.
Are you going to complain
the whole way?
Somewhere we'll have
the advantage.
If a breadcrumb’s too small
then he might miss it.
Too big and Silva
will smell the rat.
That's what you think, even Silva
will be able to spot that?
Creating a false tracking signal
for Silva to follow.
Excellent thinking.
Get them isolated.
Send him on the I89.
It's the direct route.
You can monitor his progress
more accurately
and confirm it
with the traffic cameras.
How old were you
when you died?
Orphans always make
the best recruits.
I wonder
you never came back.
Kincade is keeping here
since I was a boy.
- Please to meet you, Emma.
- Mr. Kincade.
You're a tad late. They sold the place
when they thought you were dead.
Do we still have
a gun room?
They sold a lot to a collector
from Idaho or some such place.
They were shipped up
weeks ago.
There's just your father's
old hunting rifle.
There might be a couple of sticks
of dynamite from the quarry.
But if all else fails,
sometimes...
the old ways
are the best.
So, who are we
supposedly fighting?
Try to stop me,
you jumped-up little shit.
Now, remember what I taught to you.
Don't let it pull to the left.
What did you say
you did for a living?
she still has
her secrets ways.
Yes, from
Reformation times.
The tunnel leads
under the moor.
If you get in danger,
this is the place to come.
The night I told him
his parents have died...
he's hidden here
for two days.
I fucked this up,
didn't I?
- And?
- Appalling.
It called you 'An example
of the British fortitude.'
I was ready before
you're were born, son.
Always good
at making an entrance.
You two, go to
the kitchen. Now!
Go to the chapel.
Use the tunnel.
Everyone listen to me.
Don't you dare touch M.
And your friends
come out and say 'hello'?
Just make sure
Bond is dead.
You see what comes of all
this running around, Mr. Bond?
All this jumping
and fighting.
I'll give her
a goodbye kiss for you.
- I can't find it, though.
- No.
What have they
done to you?
What have they
done to you?
got into some
deep water.
too late to hang around
and fret.
I didn't even know
you could come up here.
I thought you were going back
out on active service.
Field works
are not for everyone.
If it helps,
I feel a lot safer.
Maybe it was her way of telling you
to take a desk job.
You know, we've never formally
been introduced.
I look forward to our time together,
Miss Money penny.
I'm sure we will have
one or two clear shaves.
- Good morning, Tanner.
- He will see you now.
All pretty shocking
for someone
Are you ready
to get back to work?
