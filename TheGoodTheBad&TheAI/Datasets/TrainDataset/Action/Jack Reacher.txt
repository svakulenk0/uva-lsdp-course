Move!
EMERSON:
It's life or death now, James.
By that,
I mean you're doing one or the other
up in Rockview.
This here is
District Attorney Rodin.
Want to know what he's wondering?
Whether you're gonna walk
like a man or cry like a pussy
on your way to the death house.
See, the D.A. Likes the needle,
whereas me,
I like to see a man like you
live a long life
with all your teeth knocked out.
Passed around till a brother
can't tell your fart from a yawn.
Now, I don't know
what kind of man you are,
which of these two fates you prefer,
but Rodin here is a generous fellow.
He's willing to let you take your pick.
If you save us and this city
a long and costly trial,
waive your right to counsel and confess,
right now.
Sixteen hours.
Has to be some kind of
record, Detective.
What the hell is this?
Who the hell is Jack Reacher?
Jack Reacher,
born Jack, not John, no middle name,
is a ghost.
No driver's licence, current or expired.
No residence, current or former.
No credit cards, no credit history.
No P.O. Box, cell phone, e-mail.
Nothing.
Can you at least tell me who he is?
Well, I can tell you who he was.
Blood military.
Born and raised on bases abroad.
Mother was a French national,
father in the Corps.
His first trip to the United States
was to attend West Point.
Four years later, he ships out for good.
Iraq. Afghanistan. The Balkans.
You name it.
Served with distinction.
Silver Star, Bronze Star,
Legion of Merit.
Defence Superior Service Medal?
Had to look that one up.
And a Purple Heart.
He spent the bulk of his service
in the Military Police.
By all accounts, a brilliant investigator.
Apparently, a troublemaker, too.
Demoted to Captain.
Worked his way back to Major.
Then two years ago, he musters out.
After a literal lifetime in the military,
he just up and quits. And then,
for only the second time in his life,
he enters the United States
and simply disappears.
RODIN: Dead, maybe?
EMERSON: Not according
to Social Security
and a bank account in Virginia.
His pension is deposited monthly
and someone is making the occasional
withdrawal. All wire transfers.
I can't find out where
without a federal warrant.
RODIN: Well, he can't drive or fly.
At least not under his real name.
- Any warrants?
- EMERSON: Record's clean.
Oh, come on! A guy this hard to find?
Gotta be wanted for something.
His record is clean.
So,
how do we find this Reacher?
Obviously, you don't find this guy
unless he wants to be found.
Excuse me, sir. There's
a Jack Reacher here to see you.
Can I help you?
James Barr.
So, now you've seen him.
How do you know him?
Why wasn't he in protective custody?
That was an oversight.
More like some Corrections flunky
threw him to the wolves.
EMERSON: Just as likely.
But it's done and we can't undo it.
So what happens now?
Well, now he's in a coma.
We'll try him when he wakes up.
If he wakes up.
Okay? Now it's your turn, Reacher.
Why did he call you as a witness?
I don't believe he did.
Well, I believe
he asked for you by name.
Any chance I could look
at the evidence?
No way.
Not till you answer some questions.
Nice meeting you.
- Hey. Hey. Hey!
- Mr Reacher.
- Mr Reacher!
- Hey, stop! Stop right there!
We had a deal.
I take you to Barr,
you tell me what you know.
I know you say he shot five people,
I know he's in a coma.
I know there's a bus station
three miles away
and I can walk there in 24 minutes.
So you're just going to
walk out on your friend?
- He's not my friend.
- Why'd he ask for you, then?
Well, same reason he shot five people,
he's crazy.
Hey. Hold on.
Don't do that.
HELEN: Well, this is a new low,
even for both of you.
Uh-oh.
You do not talk to my client
without me present.
You know that.
RODIN: We weren't talking to your client.
He's in a coma, for Christ's sakes.
- You're Barr's attorney?
- Helen Rodin, Jack Reacher.
- Jack Reacher?
- Helen Rodin.
Yeah, she's the
District Attorney's daughter.
It's a good story, actually.
I'd like to hear it.
How'd you find him?
How'd they find you?
You can't be talking to this man.
Two strikes in one day.
- It's not what it looks like.
- He came to us.
- You went to the D. A?
- Is there a law against that?
None you're currently breaking.
Come on, before this gets awkward.
Now, hey.
Say, "See you in court." For me.
Goodbye, Detective.
- Weird meeting you.
- Likewise.
Let's go.
So...
So, you're Jack Reacher.
- So you're the D.A.'s daughter.
- Oh, Jesus. Please.
- Is that even legal?
- Fortunately.
- How does that happen?
- I'll tell you after deposition.
You don't want to depose me.
Oh, well, you're my only
defence witness.
- I'm not a defence witness.
- Your friend James thinks you are.
He's not my friend.
Why does everyone assume that?
Well, why else would he ask for you
and why would you
come here to help him?
I didn't come here to help him.
I came here to bury him.
Linsky.
Who the hell is Jack Reacher?
- HELEN: So why are you so hard to find?
- I'm impossible to find.
Why is that?
Well, you could say it started out as an
exercise and became an addiction.
Are you on the run?
My bus is leaving.
You better hurry, counsellor.
How do you know James Barr?
- Why are you representing him?
- I'm a lawyer.
So is a public defender, with just as
much chance of clearing Barr.
I'm not trying to clear him,
I am just trying
to keep him off death row.
- By proving he's insane?
- Well, that's one option.
And sticking it to your father because...
No. Not my father.
The Office of the District Attorney.
Because the Office of the District
Attorney never bought you a pony.
D.A. Rodin's never lost a capital case.
You know why?
Impeccable tailoring.
- He never picks a fight he can't win.
- Worked for the Red Baron.
Every murder suspect in this town
is given a choice.
Confess or face death.
Against a D.A. Who never loses.
My firm has reason to believe
more than one innocent man
has gone down without a fight.
Oh, I get it.
You're an idealist.
No. I'm a pacifist.
It's a noble crusade.
But this is not the fight. Trust me.
James Barr's guilty.
You haven't even seen the evidence.
Is this a privileged conversation?
Of course, it's a client conference.
Nothing you say here can be repeated.
There are four types of people
who join the military.
For some, it's a family trade.
Others are patriots, eager to serve.
Next, you have those
who just need a job.
Then there's the kind who want a legal
means of killing other people.
James Barr was one of those.
He made sniper.
Trained hard.
Two thousand rounds a week.
And with every shot,
he's taught to visualise
the base of a man's skull
through his reticle.
The sweet spot where
the medulla meets the spine.
Visualise that puff of pink mist.
Finally, he's deployed to Iraq.
He's put on overwatch.
All day long
he stares through a scope at civilians.
Women.
Children.
Day in, day out, for two long years
without ever once being
cleared to fire a single shot.
Then comes the drawdown.
For James Barr, the war's over.
Two thousand rounds a week.
A quarter million rounds in his career,
not one at a human target.
You've been hungry.
You've been horny.
You've had an itch you can't scratch.
Imagine that feeling.
Days. Weeks. Years.
Imagine that feeling times 200,000,
plus 50,000 more.
Imagine it's 130 degrees on the deck
and tomorrow you're going home
and you know if you don't
scratch that itch now,
you never will.
You need a release.
You need a target.
And the who of it
never once enters your mind.
He covered his tracks well,
just like sane people do.
He almost got away with it, too.
But I caught him. And he confessed.
So why didn't he go to prison?
What Barr didn't know that day was the
four civilian contractors he'd picked off
just spent the weekend
at what they call a rape-rally.
It was 28 women,
ages 54 on down to 11.
Those were just the ones I could find
before the case was shut down.
See, the deeper I dug, the uglier it got.
And after seven long years
of "Mission Accomplished,"
someone in the corporation just wanted
the whole thing to end quietly.
So they chalked it up to the fog of war,
made the murders go away.
This is classified information.
And that's why the privilege.
But you were ready
to tell this to the D.A.
The last time I saw Barr,
I made him a promise.
And when I saw his name on the news,
I came here to keep it.
- But now I know I don't have to.
- How can you be sure?
You still haven't seen the evidence.
Your father has.
And he doesn't pick a fight he can't win.
Barr's not getting away
with murder again.
He might.
He suffered a severe brain injury
in state custody.
When he wakes up, if he wakes up,
he may not remember the event,
he may not remember anything at all.
And this case won't be about
James Barr's guilt or innocence.
It'll be about his ability to stand trial.
After everything I just told you,
you still want to defend him?
I want to see he gets a fair trial.
You said he confessed in Baghdad.
He didn't confess this time.
- This time he knows better.
- This time he asked for you.
I want to know why.
You want to know why.
I can see it's eating you.
And you can't ask Barr,
and the D.A. Won't let you
see the evidence.
My lead investigator has complete
access to the evidence. All of it.
- So where's your lead investigator?
- About to catch a bus out of town.
Thanks for the coffee, counsellor.
You understand you're not just
asking me to look at the evidence.
You're asking me to look
at a cold-blooded killer.
A man I know to be guilty.
A man you want to keep off death row.
And you're asking me
to look at him objectively.
Yes, that is what I'm asking.
I'll do it. On one condition.
Name it.
You have to look
at the victims objectively.
How do you suggest I do that?
- Yes?
- Mr Farrior?
I'm Helen Rodin.
We spoke on the phone.
Of course.
You said you're defending
the man that ki...
That man.
HELEN: I represent James Barr, yes.
FARRIOR: And you have questions
about my daughter?
HELEN: I do.
FARRIOR: What for?
I was hoping to get a better sense
of who the victims were as...
That is to say, who they were as people.
- As human beings.
-
That's a bit unusual,
considering your position, isn't it?
That is true.
Normally someone in my position
would want the jury
to know as little as possible about the...
FARRIOR:
The people that your client killed.
In cold blood.
Have you spoken
with the other families?
Yeah, some.
The ones who would speak with me.
Come in.
Thank you.
FARRIOR: Chrissie was a nanny.
She had a little girl with her that day.
Yes, I know.
Are you gonna go talk with that child?
No, of course not. I...
Why not?
- Well, I think it would be...
- Insensitive?
Inappropriate?
Everything that you want to know
about my daughter
is right here.
The Gazette did a nice piece on her.
Her obituary does the rest.
Thank you. I'll definitely have a look.
You a good attorney, Miss Rodin?
- That's not really for me to...
- Just
answer the question.
Yes, I suppose I am pretty good.
Good enough to keep
that man off death row?
You know,
I think maybe I should go.
You stay where you are.
That man deserves to die, Miss Rodin.
Why would you defend him?
I can see
that I have made a terrible mistake.
And I'm very, very sorry
and I promise I won't bother you again.
Hello, Dad.
What the hell are you doing?
What am I... What?
Is it true?
You're talking to the victims' families?
You? Alone?
How do you know that?
How did you find me here?
I'm the District Attorney.
It's my business to know.
That's not an answer.
Oh. Well, you're not the only one
with crack investigators, Helen.
That's right. I know about Reacher.
Your lead investigator is a war veteran
who's been missing
for the last two years.
How can you vouch
for his state of mind?
How can you trust anything he tells you?
You don't know the man.
Tell me this,
does he know you can't pay him?
That your own firm
didn't want this case?
That nobody wants this case?
You never even spoke to your client
before he wound up in a coma.
Oh, now listen to me! Listen.
Listen, I'm speaking as your father.
Whatever our differences
have been in the past,
you gotta listen to me now.
You're making a terrible mistake.
You cannot win this case.
You're going to ruin your career.
Why? For what?
To hurt me? To change me?
- Helen...
- Don't touch me!
REACHER:
Thanks for letting me take a look.
Hey. We love it
when friends of the accused
try to tear our work to shreds.
He's not my friend.
So you keep saying. Find any holes?
Well, you didn't have to
put him in the hospital.
Other than that, damn fine police work.
It's open and shut.
What can I say?
The scene was a gold mine.
Come on. Now we both know
gold's only as good as the man digging.
Yeah, well, anytime you want to come
back, take a look at this stuff...
No, thanks. Don't need to.
You never took any notes.
Oh, I don't need to.
So you were some real hot shit
in the Army, huh?
I did all right.
So what does an Army cop do mostly?
Break up bar fights?
I did what you do pretty much,
with one minor difference.
What's that?
Every suspect was a trained killer.
Thanks again.
Why do you think he paid for parking?
Pardon?
He's about to fire six shots
into a crowd of strangers.
And he's worried about the meter maid?
"Simple loony" won't do it for you?
I like to have
at least one alternate theory.
Huh.
Habit.
Muscle memory.
I don't think he knew he was doing it.
Like I said, it's damn fine work.
Hey, Army.
What's the serial number on the rifle?
What's the date on the quarter?
Forest for the trees, Detective.
Forest for the trees.
Mind if I share your table?
I'm Sandy.
So was I. Last week.
On a beach, in Florida.
What's your name?
Jimmie Reese.
You don't look like a Jimmie.
What do I look like?
I don't know. But not a Jimmie.
Hmm.
So you're new in town?
Usually.
It's kind of loud in here.
Do you want to maybe go
someplace quieter? I have a car.
You're old enough to drive?
I'm old enough to do a lot of things.
I'm on a budget, Sandy.
What?
I can't afford you.
I'm not a hooker.
Oh, then I really can't afford you.
Seriously, I work at the auto parts store.
What I mean is, the cheapest woman
tends to be the one you pay for.
I am not a hooker!
No. A hooker would get the joke.
- MAN: What's this?
- He called me a whore.
Is that true?
Well, nobody said whore.
She inferred hooker, but I meant slut.
Hey. That's our sister.
Is she a good kisser?
Hey. Outside.
Pay your cheque first.
I'll pay later.
You won't be able to.
You think?
All the time. You should try it.
It's a great joke,
but I'm going to beat your ass.
Do you want to do that here or outside?
Outside.
Stay here, Sandy.
I don't mind the sight of blood.
When it means
you're not pregnant, anyway.
You still think you're funny now, creep?
Shut your mouth, Sandy!
No one is talking to you.
It's your last chance to walk away.
Are you kidding? It's five against one.
It's three against one.
How do you figure?
Well, once I take out the leader,
which is you,
I'll have to contend
with one or two enthusiastic wingmen.
The last two guys, they always run.
Oh, you've done this before?
Yeah.
It's getting late.
Remember,
you wanted this.
It's okay. You're okay.
- Get up.
-
Okay.
Now we know who's who.
Let's get this done.
Really?
-
-
Shit!
On the ground!
That's a pretty impressive
response time, fellas.
COP 1: Do it!
COP 2: Hands behind your back.
Who hired you?
COP 2: Let's go.
Hey, Helen.
HELEN:
Am I wearing too much perfume?
Breathing too sternly.
Detective Emerson.
- Somebody dead?
- And if someone is?
Then they died of shame.
'Cause I was being gentle.
I'm starting to understand
why you move around a lot, Reacher.
REACHER: So no one's dead.
One guy
likely won't ever walk right again.
REACHER: You want to charge me.
EMERSON: Very much.
But no one's pressing.
Sadly, no.
Am I free to go?
Hey, Emerson.
What's that?
It's the serial number on Barr's rifle.
You're working for me,
do you understand that?
So everything you do
is a reflection on my firm. On me.
I was set up.
You're talking to a lawyer.
There was this girl. She came onto me.
Picked a fight.
Which never happens in a bar.
She was thrown
when I told her my name.
She was expecting Mike Tyson?
She wasn't expecting Jimmie Reese.
Yankees second baseman.
Why did you say you were
a Yankees second baseman?
I always use Yankees second basemen.
I didn't say I was a Yankees
second baseman, I just said...
Look, the point is,
she was expecting to hear
"Jack Reacher."
She knew who I was.
And the cops were rolling
before the fight even started.
And those five guys are her brothers?
Come on.
Someone sent those boys
to put me down.
Who?
HELEN: If someone followed you
at the river today,
it was probably a cop.
And I highly doubt...
There are three things cops never do.
They don't vote Democrat,
they don't drive Cadillacs,
and they never use personal vehicles.
It's not a cop.
A P.I., then, or the D.A.'s office.
You think your father's office
would set me up?
Why would anyone set you up?
How was your day?
It went exactly the way I think
you hoped it would.
You okay?
Mmm-hmm.
What'd you learn?
HELEN: Chrissie Farrior was 22.
A nanny caring for the six-year-old
daughter of family friends.
She'd finally saved enough
money for a trip to China,
in fact, she should have left
the week before.
But the girl she cared for wanted
Chrissie to stay for her 7th birthday.
They'd gone downtown that day
to shop for a party dress.
Rita Coronado worked as a cleaning
lady at the River Cross Plaza.
She was usually late for work,
but she had a good reason.
Since her son Marco
was nine years old
she had to personally drop him at
school to make sure he actually went.
But her dedication had paid off.
Marco was now an honour student.
As a reward for all his hard work,
Rita was taking him
to his first baseball game.
And she was on her way to pick up
the tickets that very afternoon.
Nancy Holt's last words to her husband
were a lie.
- I love you, babe. See you!
- Bye.
She told him she was
taking her car to be serviced,
but in fact, she was headed downtown.
It's perfect.
She told the clerk she didn't want the
purchase showing up on her credit card.
She wanted to surprise her
husband for their 10th anniversary
- just a few days away.
- Thank you.
Oline Archer never liked
her husband's construction business,
even after helping him become one of
the largest contractors in the county.
So it came as a relief when
his failing health and a costly lawsuit
were forcing them
to sell to the competition.
Rob?
Help! Help!
Her husband
had given his life for the company.
But now that it was hers,
she couldn't bring herself to let it go.
She was on her way
to secure a loan that day
so she could keep the business
she'd always hated.
Darren Sawyer was
an investment broker
in the same building where Rita worked.
His wife said
he'd grown increasingly distant of late.
She can't remember their last words
to one another, but they weren't kind.
Darren's body was found beside
a fresh bouquet of roses
he'd bought that morning
and his wife takes comfort
in the fact that, in his last moments,
he was most likely thinking of her.
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay.
REACHER: So what'd you learn?
You want me to say you were right.
You want me to say
that this isn't the fight.
James Barr should die.
Maybe he should.
I meant, what did you
learn about the victims.
What more do you want?
They were five innocent people
senselessly murdered.
I'm sorry.
Could you please put a shirt on?
This is my shirt.
You lose your luggage?
I don't have any luggage.
Uh, what was I saying?
- Five innocent people.
- Murdered at random, yes.
You know how many people
die in this country every year?
Two and a half million.
That means every day,
roughly 7,000 average Americans
wake up for the last time.
Last Friday, five of them converged
on a single spot and died together.
Is that random?
What else would you call it?
Well, take Darren and Nancy.
Odds are they were having an affair.
Excuse me?
You don't buy roses
for your wife on the way to work.
You buy them on the way home.
And you don't worry about a charge
showing up on your credit card
when your anniversary is that weekend.
Unless it's the gift you're hiding.
And that's why she kept walking
while everyone else ran.
You can't prove that.
How hard would it be?
Cell phones, e-mails.
All it takes is someone willing to dig.
What's your point exactly?
My point is that two of the victims
weren't there strictly by chance.
I need a list of Barr's known associates.
There isn't one. He didn't have any.
He's a classic loner.
He didn't even talk to his neighbours.
He was a quiet man.
Never bothered anyone.
Yeah, exactly.
- You have his credit card statement?
- I can get it. Why?
I need the list
of all the places he hung out.
Bars, bowling alleys, strip clubs,
gun ranges.
Anywhere someone
would remember him.
What do we hope to find?
I need some sleep.
You, too.
You don't really think I'm gonna...
Be back to pick me up at 7:00.
Yep. Absolutely.
Who's with you?
What happened?
Oh, that's him, isn't it?
I ain't seeing you, man!
Relax. What happened?
Barr's attorney hired an investigator.
Name of Reacher.
Some sort of top-shelf Army cop.
He was in Baghdad
the same time as Barr.
So?
So Barr asked for this soldier by name.
Then he shows up at the river today.
Then up on the highway.
Almost like he knew something.
And you said we don't like
people asking questions.
No, we sure don't.
So I took steps.
You took steps.
Local people. My guys.
And it blew back on you.
I figured five guys would do it.
Mmm. This franchise
was yours to manage.
That's all. Maintenance is our thing,
you understand?
Yeah, I understand. I couldn't reach you!
Well, that's how this works.
Well, I had to make a decision!
- These locals, I want their names.
- It's in the file.
Any of them know who you are?
Just one, but I took care of it.
You...
-  Where's the body?
- It's distributed.
Relax! No one's gonna find it.
- Suppose we want it found, yeah?
- Why the hell would you want it found?
'Cause we got a way of doing things
so they stay done.
Clean!
A missing person isn't clean.
Christ's sakes, man. You only had to kill
one goddamn person.
You tapped five! You call that clean?
I call it done. They're looking
at the shooter, not the target.
Jesus.
We make it messy now
so it won't get messy later.
And we don't leave
questions unanswered ever.
Okay, all right. Okay. I can fix this.
- MAN: Open your eyes.
- No, I ain't seeing you!
MAN: It makes no difference now.
I made a mistake.
I mean, you can still use me,
just tell me how to fix...
To survive.
Don't say "fix it," because you can't.
We covered up the one mess.
You made another.
All right. You're right.
You're right.
You're absolutely right. I'm sorry.
Just tell me what I have to do.
I was in prison in Siberia.
I spent my first winter
wearing a dead man's coat.
A hole in one pocket.
I chewed these fingers off
before the frostbite
could turn to gangrene.
These I gave up
to avoid working in the sulphur mine.
That is how I survived
when so many others did not.
A man this rare can always be of use.
So show me. Show me you are rare.
Show me you'll do anything to survive.
I don't understand.
The fingers from your left hand.
Have you... Have you got a knife?
Did I have a knife in Siberia?
No... Come on, you've got to be kidding.
You can do it.
Show me.
Christ!
Can't! I can't.
Always the bullet.
- I can't!
- I don't understand.
What do we do about the soldier?
What we always do.
Barr's credit card statement.
Eyewitness testimonies.
Coffee. You take it black, right?
Yeah. What can I say?
I take my work home.
Afraid Barr's credit card
statement's a dead end.
No bars, no strip joints, nothing.
Pretty much just gas and groceries.
I need you to look for gun ranges
between 100 and 150 miles from here.
Limit your search to ranges
longer than 300 yards.
Sure, if you tell me why.
Barr consistently filled
his tank on Saturday,
and again on Sunday.
He took a long drive
almost every weekend.
- He could be going anywhere.
- Yes.
And if it's bars, bowling alleys
or strip clubs, we'll never find it.
But a Match-level gun range?
There might be two.
And he made his own bullets.
That means he shot a lot.
I'm guessing every Saturday.
Maybe with a friend.
Why is it so important
you talk to his friends?
Assuming he had any.
Drop me at the auto parts store.
I... Wait. Which one?
I don't know.
She just said "the auto parts store."
She? Who?
Reacher, can you be
a little more specific?
I didn't say "an auto parts store."
Which one stands out in your mind
as the auto parts store?
HELEN: You want me to wait?
- No, I'll meet you back at the office later.
- HELEN: How will you get there?
I'll hitch a ride.
Can I help you?
Sandy work here?
What's this about?
So she does, thanks.
I need to speak with her.
It's a personal matter.
- She's on the clock.
- Legal personal matter.
What are you, a cop?
Call her out, Gary.
- I'm gonna need to see some I.D.
- Go get Sandy.
Well, I need to see something.
How about the inside of an ambulance?
Okay, I'm calling the police.
I don't think Sandy wants
the police involved...
- Hello?
...but let's ask.
Hey! You...
Hello? I need some help.
Hello? Hey! You!
No. You are not allowed
back in here, man!
Shit.
You know this guy?
Tell him.
Give us a few, Gary.
Listen, I wasn't... I didn't know.
I didn't know that was going to happen!
It was Jeb.
The big guy.
Jeb Oliver.
He told me you were a predator.
You were supposed to start groping me.
Just don't hurt me.
Sandy, sit down.
Where can I find Jeb?
I don't know.
He didn't come to work today.
So he works here.
Yeah.
It's bullshit, though. He cooks crystal.
His address, write it down.
I'm really sorry, mister.
You were supposed to be a pervert.
And it was an easy 100 bucks.
That's all?
When Jeb asks, you do what he says.
Am I in trouble?
Not if you lend me your car.
- I don't have a car.
- Well, sure you do. It's outside.
I'm guessing you're the Camaro.
That whimsy little pickup
has Gary written all over it. Keys?
I can't. It's Jeb's car!
Well, won't he be surprised
when I drive it home for him.
Who are you, mister?
Really?
I'm just a guy
who wants to be left alone.
I get off work at six!
Maybe we could...
Sandy, listen.
Now, you seem like a sweet girl.
You're pretty.
You're obviously sharp,
doing Gary's books for him.
You don't have to
let these guys use you.
It's just what girls like me do.
You got money?
A little.
Get out of town for a couple of days.
Why?
Get out of town, Sandy.
Is Jeb home?
I have a warrant to search the premises.
I see.
Well, if you don't mind...
MAN: Get him! Get him! Get him!
I got this!
Okay, okay.
All right.
Don't move.
I'll tell you what.
When I move, you pull the trigger.
Aah!
- Where's Jeb?
- He's not here.
Where can I find him?
Jesus! My hand!
Well, you shouldn't play with guns.
Where can I find him?
You're the one driving his car.
You tell...
The last I saw him,
we was all leaving jail.
He said he had to see a guy.
- What guy? Who?
- I don't know.
I don't know, I swear.
Next I know,
his mom woke up from a bender
and his shit's all gone.
Is he the sort to light out like that?
No, no, man.
He'd never leave his moms alone.
Shit ain't right.
- Got a car?
- It's outside.
Keys.
My hand, man.
They're in my pock... Aah!
Okay, okay.
Now look at your friends.
Now look at my face.
Do you ever want to see me again?
No way.
Am I stealing your car?
Use it as long as you like.
You're very kind.
Ah!
REACHER: I think Jeb Oliver's dead.
- Who's Jeb Oliver?
- He was the guy from the bar.
Jesus, how hard did you hit him?
What? No, not me.
No, he was murdered.
And someone tried to make it
look like he left town.
Well, maybe he just left town.
You pack your shower curtain
when you travel?
Is this what you base
your conclusions on?
What is that on your head?
Uh...
You don't want to know.
You said on the phone
you wanted to submit your findings.
James Barr was a sniper.
Not the best, not the worst.
But he trained non-stop for two years.
What does training like that do?
What does any training do?
Skills become reflex. Muscle memory.
You do without thinking.
It also makes people who aren't
necessarily smart seem smart
by beating some
tactical awareness into them.
Now, 99% of the evidence
your father has against Barr
didn't exist in Baghdad,
not because Barr was smart,
but because he was trained.
See, from that garage,
the shooter had the sun in his eyes.
Targets were moving left and right.
It's difficult conditions for any sniper.
But Baghdad, you said Barr
was in a parking garage then.
Because in Baghdad,
the sun's behind him.
Targets coming straight ahead,
single file.
Ideal conditions
for even an average shooter
and the exact same conditions
he would've had
up on that highway bridge.
Up there, he would never even
have to get out of the van.
No parking meter.
No camera.
No trace evidence left behind.
And his escape is assured.
Now, I'm not saying
that he couldn't have killed
those people at the river,
but he wouldn't have.
Not that way.
- So you're saying he's crazy.
- No.
Well, what exactly are you saying?
Any single piece of evidence I'd buy.
But all of it?
Fibres, fingerprints, stray brass,
I mean...
And who the hell pays for parking?
Sane or crazy,
that just doesn't make sense.
Okay. So Barr, he wanted to get caught
and he wanted you to catch him.
That would not explain how Barr,
an average shooter firing
in poor conditions, never missed.
He did miss.
He did.
A pristine bullet,
conveniently trapped
by a liquid backstop.
The same bullet that tied
Barr's gun to the killings.
And arguably the prosecution's single
most important piece of evidence.
If Barr wanted to get caught,
he didn't miss.
Either way, it doesn't make sense.
If he wanted to get away with it,
he likely would have
and if he wanted to get caught,
Barr was incapable of such perfection.
Or maybe he just got lucky,
six shots out of six.
That's what I was willing to accept,
then those guys took a run at me.
Whoever sent them made a mistake.
It was just a bar fight.
Maybe.
Or maybe someone got nervous,
tried to run me off.
Or put me in a coma,
right next to their patsy.
Patsy?
It was such a great crime scene.
No one stopped to think
it might be too great.
Not Emerson.
Not your father.
Not even Barr's own defence attorney.
But Barr knew I would,
no matter how much
I wanted it to be true.
That's why he asked for me.
Wait.
Are you suggesting...
James Barr is innocent.
You can see what this is, can't you?
You've got a case in your hands
that may be
the last case you'll ever have
and you'll do anything
not to hit the bottom of it.
Helen.
You know,
you never should have retired.
Just, look. Listen.
For all I know, you were
standing at an intersection
with a cardboard sign three days ago.
And I hired you.
Jesus, my father was right.
- Helen. Helen.
- It makes total sense now.
It's the way you live,
the way you move around.
You're just not cut out
for the real world, are you?
Are you afraid you'll end up like Barr?
- Helen.
- Is that what this is?
Look out the window.
No, I have work to do.
- And you need to leave.
- Just humour me. Okay.
Let go of me.
- Would you tell me what you see?
- I see the same
things I see every day.
Well, imagine you've never seen it.
Imagine you've spent your whole life
in other parts of the world
being told every day
you're defending freedom.
And finally
you decide you've had enough.
Time to see
what you've given up your whole life for.
Maybe get some of that freedom
for yourself.
Look at the people.
Now tell me which ones are free.
Free from debt.
Anxiety.
Stress.
Fear.
Failure. Indignity. Betrayal.
How many wish they were born
knowing what they know now?
Ask yourself how many would do things
the same way all over again?
And how many would
live their lives like me?
Now look at the silver Audi
across the street,
the one that's been following me all day.
What does that prove?
Here's the tag number.
How long would it take you to run it?
At this time of night?
I don't know. An hour?
Do it.
Do it, and then I'll leave.
When?
No, this is my problem now.
I'll handle it.
Yeah?
You're blown.
The lawyer's running the licence plates.
Yeah. So do it?
Done.
Go to this address.
HELEN: All right, let's just say
that Barr didn't do it.
Or did it 'cause someone
put him up to it.
Either way, what have you got?
Conspiracy.
Yeah, conspiracy to kill
five random people?
There's no motive.
- It's ridiculous, right?
- It's grassy knoll ludicrous.
No point looking any further.
Exactly.
What's this?
The motive. Just hold onto it.
What are we playing, Clue?
Yeah?
Give it to me.
Thank you.
You sure
that car was following you all day?
As soon as you picked me up. Why?
It's registered to a company
called Lebendauer Enterprises.
A conspiracy to kill five random people?
That's ridiculous.
Four.
Four random people.
To hide one specific target.
REACHER: Someone needed
Oline Archer's construction business.
And Oline wouldn't let it go.
It's a convincing theory.
But it's just a theory.
The first round is the least accurate.
The snipers call it a cold shot.
Meanwhile, your eyewitness
described a pause
between the first and second rounds.
The one shot where the killer
took his time.
HELEN: And Oline Archer
was the second victim.
The one shot that mattered.
But it's just a theory.
This frame was custom made for Barr.
Whoever chose him
knew about Baghdad
and the only one who could have
told him about Baghdad
was Barr himself.
He has at least one friend.
A very close one.
Now, you find that friend,
you'll find the real shooter.
Find the real shooter? Reacher,
my job is to present the jury
with reasonable doubt. Period.
What about catching the guys
who really did this?
- Catching the guys who did this?
- Bringing them to justice?
- No, I can't take this to court.
- Exposing the truth.
Even if I believed Barr is innocent,
it's not my job.
I am just a lawyer. I'm not a cop.
And frankly, neither are you.
I can't do this any more.
Thanks for the coffee, counsellor.
Sandy?
Wait, it is Sandy, isn't it?
Do I know you?
Charlie. Jeb's friend?
Oh, come on, don't break my heart.
I'm sorry, I don't remember.
Well, we were both pretty wasted.
Oh.
- BOTH: Yeah.
-
- What, you live here?
- Just up there.
No shit.
I just moved in around the back!
How crazy is that?
It's wild.
Yeah.
Wow! You look great.
Thanks.
Well, look, you know,
I don't want to keep you, so...
Maybe we can grab a drink sometime.
Yeah, maybe.
Hey, how about tonight?
I'm meeting some people.
Okay. Well, some other time, then.
Some other time.
Do it here.
What?
HELEN: Reacher!
There's a gun range in Ohio,
targets out to 700 yards.
The only range
that matches your requirements.
You should sleep.
You have a long drive tomorrow,
and I need to go to city hall
and pull up Oline's legal history.
I wouldn't do that. Not till I get back.
If I'm right,
someone killed four random people
so no one would look directly at Oline.
And if I'm right, just saying her name
could get you killed.
- You saying I should be scared?
- Well, are you smart?
Obviously.
Then don't be scared.
What exactly am I looking for?
Someone who could kill that girl
with one punch.
Oh, you want the guy in 1109.
Ernie Johnson.
You'll see.
Out of the car!
That's our suspect! Move, move!
Suspect is headed north
on State Route 65.
I need backup and air support.
Hold up!
All clear!
Oh, God, I just don't believe it.
I don't believe it!
I issued the warrant an hour ago.
According to the victim's boss,
Reacher was seen at her
place of work this morning.
Where he threatened her boss.
The car he was driving tonight
belonged to a friend of Jeb Oliver's.
The man he assaulted.
No, those guys assaulted Reacher.
Reacher put three more men
in the hospital
this afternoon at Jeb Oliver's place.
After arriving in Jeb Oliver's car.
And Jeb hasn't been seen
since he left the hospital.
Helen, if you know where Reacher is,
you need to tell us.
I don't know where he is.
I have not seen him
since he left my office a few hours ago.
- I think she's telling the truth.
- Oh, you think, Dad? Fuck you!
Hey, I told you not to go near him.
You come into my home
and you treat me like I'm an accessory!
-  Please! You know...
- All right. All right. Come on. Enough.
- Look, let me handle it.
- I'm not done.
You're both done. Just get out.
This is Helen.
REACHER:
I'm guessing the police are there?
Yep.
By your response I'm guessing
I have about 30 seconds
before you hand them the phone.
If that.
If you believe someone
could frame Barr,
you have to believe
they could do the same to me.
I suppose that's possible.
She was a sweet kid, Helen.
And they killed her because of me.
They want me to run.
But I won't.
- I'm going to finish this.
- No, that's not a good idea.
Listen.
Two things. One, I, uh...
I stole your car.
If you want to end this,
just hang up the phone
and report it missing.
And I'll understand.
And anything else?
I thought I'd be pushing it
if I mentioned this earlier.
Now I guess all bets are off.
You need to watch what you say
to Emerson and your father.
I think one of them is in on it.
All right. Thanks for calling.
I have to go.
Wait. I've been followed from day one.
Only three people knew I was here.
Emerson, your father and you.
You need to ask yourself,
who has the most to lose
if we clear Barr?
Who tried to warn you off me?
Of course, I could be wrong.
If you think I am,
just hand over the phone.
There's no sense getting any deeper.
Who's that you're talking to?
The office.
Are we done?
Helen, listen.
- We need to...
- Good night.
You got some fine shooters here.
Fine as frog's hair.
Rarer, too.
'Cause most of them fellas out there
can't shoot worth a damn.
You ask them to put
three rounds in the black, well,
they'll suck it.
- I'm looking for the owner.
- That'd be me. Martin Cash.
Aaron Ward.
What can I do you for,
Mr Ward? Ward?
Yeah. I'm looking for a friend of mine.
We served in Iraq.
The guy just dropped
off the grid, you know?
- It happens. Yep.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Anyway, he was a shooter.
Last I heard, he lived
around here somewhere and I...
When did he get out of the Army?
Well, I didn't say the Army.
Well, you said you served with him.
You're no jarhead.
Man on a flying horse could see that.
Well, my father was in the Corps,
if that helps.
Well,
That makes you half human.
Your friend got a name?
Yeah. James Barr.
James Barr.
Never heard of him.
I think you have.
I think you've been dreading the moment
some cop comes in here
asking after him.
Because it's for sure
some soccer mom around here
is more worried about your range than
she is about the pool in her backyard
or the drain cleaner under her sink.
Wouldn't matter to her
if Barr did his killing 100 miles away,
only that he came here to rehearse.
She'd have a case to shut you down
and nothing better to do.
What do you want?
I want to know who Barr's friends were.
Those boys out there,
they're mighty touchy when it comes
to their constitutional rights.
Suppose I tell them a cop is in here
asking after my members?
- I'm not a cop.
- What are you?
I work for Barr's attorney.
We have reason to believe
he's innocent.
The hell you say.
Be that as it may, I'm the only one
who's bothered to track him this far.
You help me out, I'll be in your debt.
And if I don't?
Maybe you can coach soccer.
You put three in the centre
and maybe we'll talk.
Can I have a few to warm up?
Six inches right.
That's your mulligan, Mr Ward.
Play ball!
Let's go.
You're a little rusty, Mr Reacher.
I saw a man by that name
shoot for the Wimbledon Cup,
what, ten years ago.
And I'm pretty sure you never
played second base for the Yankees
in 1925.
Now,
I'll answer one question.
Who's your best shooter?
James Barr.
I pulled all these down
as soon as I heard about the shooting.
That's the best shot
I ever seen this side of civilian life.
Suppose I told you Barr wasn't this
good on his best day in the Army.
I handed out those targets myself.
That's my scrawl on every one.
Do you hang them downrange, too?
What, are you serious?
I'm saying
it's possible that Barr had a friend.
One who switched the targets
on the range.
Maybe Barr let him.
Made him feel like King Shit
having his name up on your wall.
I never saw one real shooter
who would do that for his own mother.
Unless he was framing his mother
for multiple murder
and using your range to do it.
Barr didn't come alone, did he?
You know, one of these nuts is likely
to kill you, they find that camera, there.
Hell, the camera's there
'cause one of these nuts
is likely to kill me.
There's Barr.
I always liked him. Always liked him.
There.
Him.
That son of a bitch.
Helen Rodin speaking.
REACHER:
Got a candidate for our shooter.
Picture, possible prints
and one pissed-off eyewitness.
I can't talk right now.
Just give me three hours to get back.
And don't talk to anyone until I get there.
I'll look into that, thanks.
This is just
what I could pull this morning.
Tax records, city and state
permit applications, contract bids.
Shell corporation in Georgia.
That's the one next to Russia,
not Florida.
They work one city at a time,
acquiring a local construction concern
just ahead of major civic redevelopment.
They build bridges no one needs.
Highways no one uses.
They're like a cancer.
A cell that won't stop growing.
They moved 12 times in 15 years.
Atlanta, Albuquerque,
Austin, Oklahoma City, Sacramento.
Always amidst allegations of corruption
including millions of dollars
in missing public funds.
And yet never an investigation.
Never even an inquiry.
It's as if Lebendauer Enterprises
were above reproach.
Well, maybe that's because
the allegations come
from the competition.
Outbid. Bitter.
Like Oline Archer.
Or maybe Lebendauer
has the cooperation of key officials.
And maybe
when that cooperation isn't enough,
they kill people who won't be bought off.
Like Oline Archer.
Helen, how much of this
do you honestly believe?
It doesn't matter how much I believe.
It doesn't even matter
how much I can prove.
It only matters how much is true.
Do you know how delusional you sound?
What happened to you?
Are you really so set on putting
this man to death that you'd ignore...
I pulled all of this paper
under my own name.
If Jack Reacher's right,
my life, your daughter's life,
is in danger now.
Whatever happens to me next
is on your head,
whether you're involved or not.
You are the District Attorney
and I've given you compelling evidence
to investigate Lebendauer Enterprises.
Your next move
will tell me which side you're on.
Oh.
I see. It's a test.
Well, this may be hard for you
to believe, but I do love you.
And obviously I'm not
going to turn a blind eye,
no matter how absurd I find all of this.
So, if you really believe
that you're in danger,
if you believe that,
then the next order of business,
is to put you
in protective custody right now.
And how safe will I be
if you're part of it?
Jesus, Helen.
Oh. Hey.
Business meeting or personal?
Hard to tell them apart.
I'll bet.
-
-
Helen?
CHARLIE: No.
Sorry, wrong number.
Is this Reacher?
Who is this?
Is this Reacher?
It's you. The guy from the car.
It's your boyfriend.
Reacher, is it you?
Helen, are you hurt?
Well, she's gonna be
if you're not here in one hour.
Do I have to tell you how this works?
You'll bounce me around
to make sure I'm not followed,
then walk me into
an ambush and kill me.
Aw, you ruined my surprise.
Well, I can do one better.
I went down to the gun range
at Hinge Creek.
I got the picture, prints,
and I'm going to the Feds.
The lawyer's all yours.
Get the Zec.
On second thought, I'd like to kill you.
Let's say winner take all.
Listen to me, you prick.
I will kill this bitch
if you're not here in one...
Shit!
You think I'm a hero?
I am not a hero.
I'm a drifter with nothing to lose.
You killed that girl to put me in a frame.
I mean to beat you to death
and drink your blood from a boot.
Now, this is how it's going to work.
You're gonna give me the address
and I'll be along
when I am damn good and ready.
If she doesn't answer the phone
when I call this number,
if I even think you've hurt her,
I disappear.
And if you're smart, that scares you,
because I'm in your blind spot
and I have nothing better to do.
You got a pen?
Don't need one.
If I had a dollar for every time
the Army called the Corps for help.
- You have something for me?
- Yeah.
Here.
You're kidding, right?
Just because I saw you
shoot ten years ago
doesn't mean I'll let you
kill some asshole with my gun.
I told you how serious this was.
And I showed up, didn't I?
So let's get to it.
Now, your shooter will be
right up there
behind those lights. Okay?
He can cover both roads
coming and going.
And kill you
just as soon as you stand up.
Well, can you take him out?
What, to dinner you mean?
Look, I don't know the type of people
you normally associate with, Reacher.
But I'm not in the habit of driving out
to the boonies at the drop of a hat
and just picking off
some total strangers, all right?
Anyway, I can't see anything,
not with them lights up.
So shoot them out.
Yeah, sure.
And then he knows right where I am.
I might as well set myself on fire.
No, sir. I'll start shooting when he does.
And how do you propose
we get him started?
Well, you could always start running.
What's wrong with your eye?
I'm saving my night vision.
Hey, Gunny, you mind if I ask you
kind of a personal question?
What, you don't think
I can shoot any more?
It is a perishable skill.
Yeah, well,
the sun will be up in an hour.
Let's get going.
I heard them call you the Zec.
That means "prisoner."
Yes?
Tell me, killing all those people,
I have to believe the money
you're making
can't possibly be enough to just...
Enough?
There is no such thing.
We take what can be taken.
This is what we do.
And you?
This one I think I understand, but you?
Why'd you do it?
You make it sound like I had a choice.
Oh, didn't you?
You'll see.
You should know I've taken steps,
that if anything happens...
If anything happens to you,
it will happen in front of your father
while he begs for your life.
You should never have involved him.
Now you will have to convince him
to forget, for your sake
and for his.
You say nothing,
but I see defiance in your eyes.
That is a look I have seen
many, many times.
When the soldier comes,
when you watch how he dies,
it will change you.
You will want to forget me then.
Reacher?
REACHER: Are you okay?
They're ready for you.
They'd like to think so.
Don't do this.
Please don't do this. Not for me.
Listen, Helen, they're not gonna
hurt you until they have me.
And that's never going to happen.
You hear me?
You just hang in there.
'Cause I'm coming to get you.
Now say you believe me.
I believe you.
This was a bad idea.
Any time now, Gunny.
Shit.
Where the hell are you, Gunny?
Suck it!
You should go.
Toss it.
REACHER:
I know you're in there, Emerson.
It was staring me right in the face.
The one piece that just didn't fit.
The quarter.
Nobody would have thought
to dump that meter.
Not even me.
You were wrong about my father.
I wouldn't make a big thing of it.
Who is he?
That's John Doe Number Two.
The man on the grassy knoll.
The thing under the bed.
They call him the Zec.
Zec? Prisoner.
What's your real name?
I was born in October.
When I get to my birthday,
I'm gonna pull the trigger.
One. Two.
Chelovek. Zec Chelovek.
Chelovek?
Chelovek? Human.
Prisoner Human Being.
- That's your real name?
- That is all I remember.
Call the police.
Were you really going to shoot him?
I knew I wouldn't have to.
One look at this guy and you know
he'll do anything to survive.
One look at me
and you know I'm not bluffing.
Yes, I have an emergency at...
Yes, I'll hold.
We're in no hurry.
With a name like yours,
you're gonna feel right at home.
Prison? In America?
A retirement home.
If I go to prison at all.
You think you're gonna walk?
You are a homeless drifter
wanted for murder.
Meanwhile, I am an old man
in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Thanks to you,
who is left to say otherwise? Who?
HELEN: Yes, hello? Yes, there's...
I have an emergency.
We'll see which one of us
goes to prison.
There are maybe
three, four people dead.
- Okay.
- My bet?
Neither one.
What did you do?
What's it look like?
What about the truth?
What about getting the guys
who really did this?
What about bringing him to justice?
I just did.
HELEN: What about clearing Barr?
What about clearing you?
REACHER: I have faith you'll sort it out.
And I hear you have an in
with the local D.A.
HELEN: But what happens to you
in the meantime?
I keep moving. Same as always.
Wait, is that my car?
This the lady?
Helen Rodin, Martin Cash.
A pleasure.
You look like hell there, Army.
You asked if I was afraid
I'd end up like Barr. I'm not.
I'm afraid I'll end up like this guy.
There's a lot of dead bodies out here.
So let's get to it.
- We should probably go.
- Wait. That's it?
It's just over?
You'll be all right, counsellor.
No. What if I need you?
How will I find you?
You don't need me.
Not any more.
Get her number. Let's go!
I'm Helen Rodin, your attorney.
This conversation is protected
by attorney-client privilege.
You understand what that means?
Yeah.
Now, the police didn't
talk to you, did they?
They're not allowed
to do that without me here.
How bad was it?
How many did I...
You don't remember
anything about the incident?
No.
But I could hear the nurses
talking to those cops out there.
I don't even
remember wanting to do it!
Look, I'm not gonna fight this.
If they say I done it, then I did.
I done things before.
I did something bad.
Real bad.
A long time ago.
And I got away with it.
James,
how well do you know this place?
Pretty well.
And how do you think
you would have done it?
I guess
I would have parked up on the highway.
The sun would be at my back
that time of day.
I got a van.
Set up in back.
Wouldn't have to worry about my brass.
Get away real clean, too.
That sound about right?
Sounds as if you know your stuff.
I forget your name.
It's Helen.
Helen Rodin.
You're going to be okay, James.
I am gonna take care of you.
You can't protect me.
No one can.
From what?
From who?
There's this guy.
He's a kind of cop.
At least he used to be.
He doesn't care about the law.
He doesn't care about proof.
He only cares about what's right.
MAN: Look at me
when I'm talking to you!
BARR: He knows what I did.
He knows where I am.
And this guy, he made me a promise.
- MAN: I said, shut your mouth!
-
BARR: If I ever got in trouble again,
he'd be there.
