What's that?
Sounds like
the garbage man.
Oh. On Tuesday?
Maybe they changed
the schedule.
Oh, shit!
Whoa!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Hold it up, you guys.
I was afraid you'd miss me.
Don't worry.
We won't.
MAN: Now that
is American workmanship.
You think the Japanese
invented that? Bullshit.
We did. For a while,
we lost it, but we got it back.
SECOND MAN:
I like Cadillacs.
Well, come around here, brother,
and get in this Cadillac.
You'll love it.
This is style and beauty.
Comfy, right? Oh,
I know what you're going to say.
That's vinyl,
but you don't want leather.
Leather's hot,
it's uncomfortable, it cracks.
Nothing but trouble.
Look at the head room.
Go ahead, start it up.
Listen to that.
That's power.
That's performance.
You know what
I like best?
What's that?
The price.
Hey! Wait a minute!
You can't drive
that car in here!
Whoa!
-Hey, guys, how's it going?
-What do you say?
Working, working.
You know.
Daddy, put me down!
Put me down!
I surrender!
GIRL: Not me!
I love you, too.
Here come the sandwiches.
Why don't they just call him
"Girl George"?
It would cut down the confusion.
Oh, Dad, that's so old.
When I was a boy and rock'n'roll
came to East Germany,
the communists said
it was subversive.
Maybe they were right.
-What's in this?
-You don't want to know.
Dad, what's wrong?
What's that army helicopter
doing here?
You said you wouldn't
go away again, you were through.
I'm not going anywhere.
GIRL: Promise?
I promise.
Jackson! Harris!
Secure the area!
John?
John, are you in there?
John, come on out.
It's Kirby.
JOHN: I know.
KIRBY: Silent and smooth,
just like always.
-I better be. You taught me.
-I'm getting rusty.
GIRL: What's going on?
-Jenny, how are you?
-Hi.
Jenny, I need
to talk to your dad, OK?
Yeah? Got a warrant?
Very funny.
-Jenny.
-OK.
John, we've got a problem.
Someone's killing your men.
JOHN: You gave them
new identities.
KIRBY: There
must have been a leak.
Lawson, Forrestal, Bennett--
they've all been hit.
Who's doing it?
You've made enemies
all over the world.
It could have been the Syrians,
the South Americans,
the Russians,
or a terrorist group.
They'll find you.
We were going to make
a normal life here.
You will, I promise.
I'm going to coordinate
with the federal people.
We'll nail those bastards
before they get close to you.
In the meantime, Jackson
and Harris will stay here.
Are they any good?
Real good, but not as good
as you were.
Is it bad?
I'm not leaving you,
if that's what you mean.
Then it can't be bad.
-How bad are you hit?
-I can make it.
I've got to get my rifle
from the shed.
Keep an eye out.
They'll be coming.
Get downwind. The air current
may tip them off.
Downwind? You think
I could smell them coming?
I did.
Jenny, you go to your bedroom
and stay out of sight.
I'll be right back.
-Where is she?
-Mellow out, man.
We can't talk business with you
waving guns in people's faces.
Your daughter's safe, Colonel.
Whether she stays that way
is up to you.
My people got business with you.
If you want your kid back,
then you better cooperate.
Right?
Wrong.
He's coming at us
with no brakes.
He's still coming,
the crazy bastard!
He'll hit us!
Shit!
Don't move, motherfucker.
Bennett, I thought you were--
Dead? You thought wrong.
Ever since you had me
thrown out of your unit,
I've waited to
pay you back.
You know what today is, Matrix?
Payday.
Tranquilizers.
I wanted to use the real thing!
JOHN: Where is Jenny?
Do you remember me, Colonel?
I remember you, scumbag,
especially the people
you've tortured and killed.
Colonel Matrix,
you do not understand...
a country like Val Verde.
It is a country
that needs a president...
who has an understanding
of discipline.
Why tell me?
Because you're going
to return to Val Verde,
and you are going
to kill the president...
that you helped
to overthrow me.
Have Bennett do it.
Sounds like something
he'd get off on.
Because President Velasquez
trusts you, Colonel.
After all, he made you
the hero of the revolution.
Captain Bennett left,
shall we say, under a cloud.
Yeah. Because he enjoyed
killing too much.
Your training, Matrix.
You can get close
to President Velasquez.
You will kill him.
We went to a lot
of trouble to find you.
We had to pretend
Captain Bennett's death...
so General Kirby
would become agitated...
and lead us to you.
Now that I have you, you will do
exactly as I tell you.
Fuck you.
Daddy!
Jenny!
JOHN: Oh, you bastards!
If you kill President Velasquez,
I will send her back to you.
If you try anything else,
I will mail her to you
in pieces.
Any sign of Matrix?
No, sir. Just those bodies.
You think there's more, sir?
If he's still alive,
I'd expect a lot more.
Sully will make sure
you get on the plane.
Henriques will stay with you,
make sure you get off.
I don't hear from
either one of them, she's dead.
How much they
paying you, Bennett?
They offered me a hundred grand.
You want to know something?
When I found it was you,
I said I'd do it for nothing.
-Hey, hold it!
-I'll be back, Bennett.
BENNETT: John!
I'll be ready, John.
We're running late, buddy.
So you and Bennett
met in the service?
Me and Henriques
is in the service, too.
Nothing like old war buddies.
Well, have a nice trip, now.
Take care.
Oh, here.
Have some beers in Val Verde.
It'll give everyone more time
with your daughter.
You're a funny guy, Sully.
I like you.
That's why I'll kill you last.
Move!
Hasta luego, fellas.
First class, 7a.
And you're 7b, sir.
Any carry-on luggage?
Just him.
Open your mouth again,
I'll nail it shut.
Fasten your seat belt, sir.
Thank you.
Could I have
a blanket and a pillow?
Sure.
-There you go.
-Thank you.
STEWARDESS: We're now preparing
for departure.
Please make sure
your luggage...
is safely stored
in the overhead compartments.
Fasten your seat belts
and extinguish all cigarettes.
Once we reach
our cruising altitude,
we'll be serving
complimentary beverages...
and then our dinner.
After that, we'll be showing
our feature film.
Your flight attendants are
Susan and Lance, and I'm Debbie.
We're here to make
your trip comfortable.
Have a safe
and enjoyable flight.
Excuse me.
How long is the flight?
We land in Val Verde
in 11 hours.
Thank you.
And do me a favor...
Don't disturb my friend.
He's dead tired.
Upright, please.
Thank you.
Sir, during takeoff,
you must remain seated.
I'm airsick.
Yeah, the bird has flown.
The cargo's aboard.
Now go to the drop-off point.
Yes. Gracias, Sully.
We are right on schedule.
With any good fortune,
today will be my last day
as a civilian.
Your father seems
to be cooperating.
You will be together
with him soon.
Won't that be nice?
Not nearly as nice as
watching him smash your face in.
Take her below.
WOMAN: Yeah!
Well, my 7:40 flight
to Vancouver was canceled.
So, how about dinner?
Yeah.
I could go to bed early, too.
-Maybe another time.
-Sounds like he's mad at you.
OK. Well, I like you, too.
All right.
Talk to you soon. Bye.
Love and careers. It's tough.
Sounds like you need a date.
Well, I don't.
Girls like you meet
a lot of nice boys at airports.
Listen, you're really
bugging me.
Hey!
Hey, slow down.
-I got something to give you.
-I'm not interested.
You don't know
what you're missing.
It looks like a nightmare.
Please leave me alone!
You fucking whore.
JOHN: Don't move.
I'm not going to hurt you.
-Step aside.
-You said, "Don't move."
Do it. Get in the car.
Ah!
Ah!
Do exactly what I tell you.
-I've got a 7:30 karate class.
-You're not going to make it.
Follow him.
I knew you would say that.
Don't get offended, but are you
going to kill me or something?
No.
You wouldn't tell me
if you were.
-Sure, I would.
-Really?
Trust me.
Stay close to him. Faster!
That's good.
WOMAN: Can you tell me
what this is about?
A guy I trusted for years
wants me dead.
I've only known you 5 minutes,
and I want you dead, too.
Out. Come on.
Hurry up.
-If you're in a hurry, I can--
-I'm almost through with you.
Listen to me.
My daughter has been kidnapped.
He's the only chance I've got
of finding her.
If he sees me or I lose him,
they'll kill her.
I need you to follow him,
tell him you're crazy about him.
Bring him over here.
I will do the rest.
You go back to your normal life.
Got it?
-No.
-Please, help me.
You're the only
chance I've got.
She has less
than 10 hours left.
They're going to kill her.
OK. All right. I'll help you.
There's this huge guy outside
in a green t-shirt.
He's a paranoid maniac,
and he's kidnapped me.
I need your help.
-I'll check it out.
-Thank you.
SULLY: I hear you're great
with transmissions.
MAN: That's right.
SULLY: Oh, yeah.
This will work just fine.
Biggs, are you there?
There's a guy over here
that may be wacko.
-I doubt I can handle him alone.
-I'll be there.
Want to see me kick ass?
-Wait here, miss.
-Thank you.
Attention all units.
Emergency on the theater level.
Suspect, 6' 2", brown hair.
He's one gigantic
motherfucker.
This used to be a great place
for hunting slash.
It's got crowded now.
I think I found
something, though.
See you.
-What are you doing here?
-I'm waiting for my--
Hey, you looking for me?
Come with us.
Eh!
What?
Matrix.
I need a quarter.
Give me a quarter!
Move it!
Son of a bitch!
-Out of the way.
-Freeze!
Aah!
Get him !
Come on.
-Stop or I'll shoot!
-No!
Hey, lady! Stop!
Wait for me!
Don't you go anywhere!
Who the hell are you, huh?
You steal my car,
rip the seat out, kidnap me,
you ask me to help find your
daughter, which I kindly do,
then you get me in a shoot-out
where people are dying.
You rip a phone booth
out of the wall,
swing from
the ceiling like Tarzan,
then a cop's going to shoot you,
and I save you,
and he starts chasing me!
Are you going to tell me
what's going on or what?!
No.
No? No?
Oh, my god! Watch out!
What are you doing?
Oh, look out! Aah!
This is not my day!
WOMAN: Whoa!
Whoa!
My car!
Aah!
-Are you all right?
-I'm dead.
You're all right.
Wait for me.
Where is she?
-Kiss my ass.
-I can't hear you!
I'll say it louder:
get fucked.
Your loyalty is very touching,
but it's not the most important
thing in your life right now.
But what is important
is gravity.
I have to remind you, Sully,
this is my weak arm.
You can't kill me.
You need me
to find your daughter.
Open the door
Cook knows.
I'll take you where I meet him.
-No, you won't.
-Why not?
Because I already know.
Remember I promised
to kill you last?
That's right, Matrix.
You did!
I lied.
Aah!
Now you don't have a car.
Now I do.
-What did you do with Sully?
-I let him go.
¡Andale!
JOHN: I'm sorry
I got you involved.
WOMAN: Tell me
what this is about.
-It's about her.
-Is this your daughter?
JOHN: People are using her
to force me to do a job.
If I don't get to her soon,
they'll kill her.
-Did you do the job?
-No.
They would kill her
even if I did it.
Our only chance
is to get to her...
before they find out
what I'm doing.
All that matters
to me now is Jenny.
Let's go. Out!
Stay put.
-What are you doing?
-Helping you get her back.
-Check the drawers.
-All right.
It's Cook.
Mess up the bed.
Act like you had
a good time with Sully.
Look at this.
All right.
Yeah?
-Where's Sully?
-In the shower.
-Who are you?
-Room service.
Open the door.
Move over there.
Hey, Sully!
Oh!
Aah!
You scared, motherfucker?
Well, you should be.
This Green Beret's
going to kick your big ass.
I eat Green Berets
for breakfast,
and right now
I'm very hungry.
I can't believe
this macho bullshit.
Fuck you, asshole.
Fuck you, asshole.
These guys eat
too much red meat!
Ah!
Where is she?
Cook!
Let's go.
This must be Cook's car.
Let's search it.
WOMAN: I think
I found something.
Look at this.
JOHN: What is this?
Coastal is a fuel depot
that supplies planes.
To whom, the airlines?
Usually smaller,
private aircraft.
Are you sure?
This is where my
flight instructor gets his fuel.
There are a lot of warehouses
on Pecondo Street.
Harris must be keeping
a plane there.
Let's go.
We'll take Cook's car.
He won't be needing it.
WOMAN: This is it.
Patria Enterprises.
This is where I was
this afternoon.
Go this way
and wait for my signal.
JOHN: Cindy? Come on.
I've seen all the equipment,
but there's no airplane.
What about your daughter?
Harris and Bennett
aren't here.
She's wherever they are.
OK. Look at this.
JOHN: These coordinates are
somewhere near Santa Barbara.
Longitude...
There's something going on
at this island north of here.
This must be where
they've taken Jenny.
Look, here's a photo
of an amphibian airplane.
-Maybe they use it to fly there.
-Let's look at that invoice.
Type 4 fuel is amphibian.
to the island and back.
But it isn't here.
I've seen everything.
It was refueled at pump station
That's San Pedro.
-How long to fly to the island?
-About two hours.
-Are we going to the plane?
-Not yet.
-Where are we going?
-Shopping.
Shopping?
Come on. Come on!
Wow!
-What's that?
-Rocket launcher.
Go!
Freeze! Don't even think
about it!
-Stick him in the truck.
-Come on. Come on.
If you call
General Franklin Kirby,
he will explain everything.
Kirby, huh? I think
we ran him in last week.
Hey.
Hooker.
Not bad.
-What's she doing?
-She's got something for us.
I bet she does.
Shit!
What the hell was that?!
Jesus Christ!
-Where did you learn to do that?
-I read the instructions.
What time do you expect Matrix
to arrive in Val Verde?
Just over two hours.
Do you think he's
going to give us any problems?
He'll do exactly as
he's told...
as long as he thinks
he'll get his daughter back.
-It's all clear.
-Good. OK, go.
Ah!
CINDY: Did anybody ever tell you
you have a lot of hostility?
JOHN: Come on. Let's move.
CINDY: I hope I can fly
this plane.
Oh, shit!
CINDY: Oh!
-Oh, no!
-What's wrong?
This isn't a plane.
This is a canoe with wings.
-Then get in and start paddling.
-Oh!
JOHN: Start the engine! Hurry!
CINDY: OK, OK.
-This plane's older than I am !
-Come on!
There's no L.E.D. read-out!
I've only trained on a Cessna.
-Hurry up!
-I'm trying!
Shit!
CINDY: Oh!
JOHN: Come on, piece of shit!
Fly or die!
Works every time.
All right.
Here we go.
-Watch out for the boat!
-We're not going to make it! Ah!
-Yes, we are.
-Aah!
Oh.
We did it. We did it.
Wow!
Well done.
Thank you.
-Matrix?
-Call the federal building.
Have them monitor every police,
aviation, and marine channel.
-What are you expecting?
-World War Ill.
Repeat: this is Whiskey X-ray
Urgent you respond.
MAN ON RADIO: Attention
unidentified aircraft.
This is the Coast Guard
cutter Marauder.
You're flying over
the San Magill gunnery range.
This is a highly
restricted area.
Change course or you will be
forced to land. Acknowledge.
Urgent. Repeat, urgent.
You must contact
General Franklin Kirby.
First change course or you risk
being shot down. Acknowledge.
They shoot the shit
out of this area all the time.
Flights out of LAX
avoid it like the plague.
-Can you go below radar?
-Not marine radar.
If I get us close to the water,
the waves can camouflage us.
-Go down.
-Oh...OK.
-Do it!
-Hang on.
We lost them, sir.
Slitting a little girl's throat
is like cutting warm butter.
Put the knife away,
and shut your mouth.
I love listening to
your little piss-ant soldiers...
trying to talk tough.
They make me laugh.
If Matrix was here,
he'd laugh, too.
Mr. Bennett,
my soldiers are patriots.
Your soldiers are nothing.
Matrix and I could kill
every one of them...
in a blink of an eye.
Remember that.
Are you trying to frighten me?
I don't have to try.
When Matrix finishes the job,
he'll be back for his daughter.
Now, whether she's alive
or dead doesn't matter.
Then he'll be after you.
Now, the only thing
between Matrix and you...
is me.
It is you that is afraid,
Mr. Bennett.
You are afraid of Matrix.
Of course. I'm smart.
But I have an edge.
I have his daughter.
-Is that it?
-That's the one.
Land here. It's the most
isolated spot we'll find.
CINDY: OK. Here we go.
You remember the message?
Commando. Kirby.
Code red. Coordinates.
Got it.
Don't break radio silence
until they see me.
How will I know?
Because all fucking hell
is going to break loose.
Be careful, Matrix.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Mira.
Sí. EI presidente aqui.
He was not on the plane.
Kill her.
?Como esta?
¡Alto!
Aah!
Welcome back, John.
So glad you could make it.
Little bitch!
I'll kill her!
Yah!
CINDY: Commando!
I say again, Commando!
This is Whiskey X-ray 448.
I have an emergency message
for a General Franklin Kirby.
I repeat,
General Franklin Kirby.
General Kirby, we have
your message on the teletype.
¡Disparen!
¡Paren disparando!
Vayan y miren.
Ah!
Aah!
¡Venganse conmigo!
Aah!
Aah!
JOHN: Jenny!
Jenny!
Jenny!
JENNY: Daddy?
Jenny!
Daddy?
Daddy?
Jenny!
Daddy?
Aah!
No, not daddy.
Come on!
Daddy.
Aah!
John? How's your arm, John?
Come find out.
No, thanks.
Think I'll take a pass.
John, stick your head out.
One shot
right between the eyes.
I'll make it quick
for old times' sake.
Stop screwing around
and let the girl go.
It's me you want.
I have one arm.
You can beat me.
Come on, Bennett, throw away
that chicken-shit gun.
You don't just want
to pull a trigger.
Put the knife in me
and look me in the eye...
and see what's going on
in there when you turn it.
That's what you
want to do, right?
-I could kill you, John.
-Let the girl go.
It's between you and me.
Don't deprive yourself
of some pleasure.
Come on, Bennett.
Let's party.
I can beat you.
I don't need the girl.
I don't need the girl!
Ha! I don't need
the gun, John.
I can beat you.
I don't need no gun!
I'm going to kill you now!
Ha!
Daddy.
You're getting old, John.
You're getting old.
Eeeah!
Eeeah!
Aaah!
John, I feel good.
Just like old times.
What's it feel like to be
a dying man, John?
You're a dead man, John.
Bullshit!
John, I'm not going to shoot you
between the eyes.
I'm going to shoot you
between the balls!
Ah...
Let off some steam,
Bennett.
Daddy.
Move out!
-Leave anything for us?
-Just bodies.
I'd like you to start up
your unit again, John.
All it would take
is your coming back.
This was the last time.
Until the next time.
No chance.
I will protect you
Nothing can hurt you
No storm clouds
gathering terrify
I am a mountain
Surrounded by your love
You are a fountain
That dreams are made of
We fight for love
We fight for love
Fight for love
Somewhere
Somehow
Someone
Somewhere
Somehow
Someone
I fight with fire
As I watch them conspire
To blow my world apart
Between the light
And the endless night
You will always be in my heart
We fight for love
We fight for love
Fight for love
We fight for love
Somewhere
Somehow
Someone
Somewhere
Somehow
Someone
Somewhere
Somehow
Someone
Somewhere
Somehow
Someone
Somewhere
Somehow
Someone
Somewhere
Somehow
