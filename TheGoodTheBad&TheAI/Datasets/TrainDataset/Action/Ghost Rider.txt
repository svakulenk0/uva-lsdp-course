It's said that the west was built
on the legends.
Tall tales that help us
make sense of things.
Too great, or too terrified to believe.
This is the legend of the Ghost Rider.
Story goes that every generation has one.
Some damned soul cursed
to ride the earth.
Collecting on the devils' deals.
Many years ago, a ghost rider was sent
to the village of...
To fetch a contract with
a thousand evil souls.
But that contract was so powerful.
He knew he could never let the devil
gets his hands on it.
So he did what no rider has
ever done before.
He outran the devil himself.
The thing about legend is--
Sometimes, they are true.
''GHOST RlDER''
Ladies and gentlemen,
The amazing racing is driving
circles spectacular.
How about a big applause to
Mack and Johnny Blaze.
It's a hard shot, aged boy.
Yeah, you think you've been there, no?
You do think they're thinking.
You ain't making the choice.
The choice's making you.
How is this doing for the crowd?
I don't know why you've done it.
You think she's gonna stand by you
when you're in the wheelchair, huh?
Huh, hard shot?
''J R FOREVER''
Hey.
What's wrong, Roxanne?
I’m leaving.
My dad's sending me to leave with my mum.
When?
-Soon.
What about us?
He says you're not good enough for me.
That you're just a farce.
So what are we gonna do, Johnny?
We'll leave.
We'll jump on the back and
just keep going.
But what about your dad?
What about the show?
He doesn't need me.
He doesn't need anybody.
Tomorrow noon, we'll meet here.
''...the cancer has spread...''
Johnny Blaze?
Yeah.
...To come to tell you how much
I enjoyed watching your ride.
Oh, thanks.
Perhaps you'd ride for me one day.
You own a show?
Crazy show on earth.
Thanks. But no, thanks.
What's wrong, Johnny?
Worried about your father?
What do you know that?
-He's gonna blend...
Think about the chance and
the time he takes.
The tall loved ones.
Johnny, what if I could help your dad?
Yeah. How?
''How'' is not important.
What if I could make him better?
Heal him back his health.
Would you be willing to make a deal?
Name me a price.
I'll take--
Your soul.
Okay.
-By sunrise tomorrow,
your father will be healthy as a horse.
All you have to do is -- sign.
Oh, that--that will do just fine.
Damn.
Morning, sleeping beauty.
Dad?
You look--
-Great, right?
Exact as what the doc said when we
were looking at the X-ray this morning.
What are you talking about?
-Private 6, huh?
We finally get up the nerve
to tell you about it.
I'm not anymore.
I can't explain it. But I feel healthy
as a horse.
Now, come on, Hard Shot.
I got a show to do.
I'll get them vibrate. I don't want to
keep those people wait.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Marcus Blaze.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Please stay calm.
Dad! Dad, it's alright. I’m here.
I’m here to help you, okay?
Dad.
Dad! Dad!
You're not good to be dead.
You--
You killed him!
I cured his cancer.
That was the deal.
But I couldn't let him come between us.
You son of the bitch!
One day, when I need you--
I will come.
Until then, I’ll be--
I’ll be watching you.
Forget about friends.
Forget about family.
Forget about love.
You're mine, Johnny Blaze.
You can't let them share.
You can't let them share.
Yeah, Johnny. Yeah!
Ladies and gentlemen,
please get off the deal
to allow paramedics through.
Oh God! Oh God!
-JB.
JB, talk to me, man!
Hack, is my bone go cunned?
Yeah. Yeah. But it's fine.
-Oh God.
Thank you.
Let's go.
They are here for go.
The amazing Johnny Blaze.
''Welcome to Texas''
Yeah, come on, go!
Make the front and deal--
Damn it!
Gressil is down.
Do you train not to crash it?
-Have you?
Why don't you have a beer, relax
like everybody else, huh?
You know alcohol gives me nightmares.
Game is on.
Wait--Wait--Can you go back?
There's a hell of monkeys
on discovery channel tonight.
Guys, hey!
''...But I see it's a rider who
they looked up to.''
''And answer the man who's not even
competing here.''
''Johnny Blaze!''
Yeah, cause he's right here.
''But what we don't know is how much
longer could Blaze cheat death.''
His critics called the papers--
-Get the Monkey Show on that.
Mack, the Monkey Show.
-Shhh!
''...each jump was similarly
not regard for his own life.''
''They call it, Mr Invisible.''
''They don't have to be on the next jump
while Johnny Blaze attempted...''
''...from few goal to few goal--''
What?
What?
You should be taking a dirt nap after
that ragdoll today.
I got lucky.
I’ve got a Han dog named Lucky--
he's got one eye and no nuts.
Lucky don't cover it, JB.
You got an angel looking after you.
Yeah, maybe.
Mack, are you in?
Yeah. Yeah, I’m in.
Screw over, ladies.
What's in it?
-Maybe the soon is ours soon.
There you go.
It took you long enough.
I think you might be lost, boy.
Angel's only in there.
-Angels? Really?
Yeah, really.
You got a problem with that?
As a matter of fact--
I do.
Yeah, I’m in the neighborhood, Johnny.
Enjoy the harmonic association yet?
Oh, I see you still haven't got
the lock through your life.
That's great. Great. You got a lot of
expense on bikes in here, man.
I told you, how many times.
Well, JB, said it before.
I’ll say it again.
This place could use woman's touch.
So could you turn back?
Alright, 4 out of 5.
Rack one more, you'll get the whole set.
I’m glad to see you finally
use on your books.
You want some jellies?
No. I don't want none of
your stupid candy.
Actually I want to talk about
some kind of serious.
I’m trying to relax, Mack.
-Yeah, I understand.
Alright. It's just gonna take a second.
It's about you jump on the anniversary
of your dad's accident.
Can--can I just turn this music off
for a minute?
This jump, man. We--
Mack, you touch the cabinets
or to change video again,
we're gonna scape on our hands.
-This jump is nuts.
Alright, man. I mean
few goal to few goal.
Now you're hitting cars. I mean--
What are you trying to prove?
That's me.
That's you?
Ride on a bike.
Of course it's you. Who the hell
else's gonna be?
You know you're freaking me out.
You're freaking me out because
you're reading this--
compared exponential relic geocity crap.
It's getting in your brain.
What's going on, man?
Do you believe people
get second chances?
I don't know.
lf somebody makes a mistake,
a big mistake--
Do you think that person
should have to pay for it everyday
for the rest of their lives.
Are you talking about your daddy's
accident?
Well--
I was just looking for a sign.
What kind of sign?
That I can take a negative and
turn into a positive.
That I can have a second chance too.
Look, at least promise me
you'll think about taking the cars out.
I’ll think about it.
I knew you were here.
I can smell you're here.
Hello, Gressil.
Why are you here?
Wallow.
What do you want from us?
I’ve come for the contract
to send the guns in.
That it's said that the contract
was stolen and hidden
on the graveyard not far from here.
Now you can help me to find it.
Abigor.
And when we find it, then what?
Then we'll take this world.
One city--
At a time.
How about Mephistopheles?
Don't ever say that name!
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the Johnny Blaze's legal jump.
Yeah...!
Yeah, baby, go...! Jump!
Hey, JB.
-Shh.
You're stepping on Karen.
What was that you're gonna say, man?
I just tried the second check
on the lap so it'd look good.
Crowd's kind of out of control.
Johnny, you know you don't have
to do this, don't you?
Is this suit feel alright?
It feels a little loose.
The suit's fine.
Would you bring on my hat, Mack?
Thank you.
You can't live in fair.
Alright, JB. We just get you
on the right.
Mr Blaze, any case of complexity,
I was wondering do you have time
for friends of you?
Look, I don't know how long you've
been doing your job, ma'am.
But Johnny Blaze don't do
interviews, okay?
Not even for your old friend.
Hey, Johnny.
Hi.
I’ll do it.
Okay, and ready in 5, 4, 3, 2...
How's your dad?
Johnny Blaze, thank you for talking
to us before your big jump.
No one has ever attempted
such a distance.
What's going to your mind right now?
You look really good.
I’ve seen you on TV. You know,
I watch a lot of TV.
You do a really good job.
Johnny, what's right somebody to risk
their lives for entertainment?
I heard you got married.
No. Not about that thing.
-Oh, no-no.
Most of the time, the press
focuses on the crashes,
the broken bones, the cost
on what you do.
Are there any other costs?
Yeah.
Okay, well. Thank you for this revealing
tip into the life of Johnny Blaze.
I’m Roxanne Simpson on scene.
Yeah, well.
You're gonna stay for the jump,
aren't you?
Oh, you know, we gotta get back.
Plus I never let to be watching you jump.
Roxanne.
...said that you two have
some kind of history.
That was it, Mack.
The sign.
-The sign?
You sure you don't want to stick around?
-No.
He hasn't started yet.
-Uh-uh.
I’ll buy you a doughnut.
-Uh-uh.
Come on, Roxanne. It's Johnny Blaze.
Let's go.
Thank God you listened to me.
You took the cars out.
It would be suicide otherwise.
This way, if you come out
short, so you'll--
come down on some nice, soft green--
Grass.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Johnny Blaze will not be jumping 15 cars
today on schedule.
But instead he'll be leading 6
US60 Black Hawk Helicopter.
Never before has any man
has done such device stuff.
I took the cars out.
Why? Why Johnny?
Why wouldn't you tell me?
Well, because you were the thrown feet.
Call me old fashioned,
I’m funny that way.
Human sacrifice makes me uncomfortable.
Why Johnny? Why helicopters, man?
You know what I’ve been thinking about?
A new stunt.
Instead of the cars in fire,
a helicopter.
My dad thought it would be cool.
He was right.
-Yeah.
Okay. Okay. This is the deal, man.
Half way down the ramp
I want you to hit the Nos. Okay?
Do not hit the NOS too early,
if you hit it too early,
You're screwed, you got that?
Hey, JB, where's your head at man?
She's probably
in the inner state by now. Huh?
How much NOS is put in the tank?
Enough to spin the space shuttle.
Mack.
-Chief, go ahead.
Oh God, he's gonna make it.
He made it.
I told you he'd make it.
Yeah, JB!
Let's cheer for him,
ladies and gentlemen.
there's only Johnny Blaze can do.
Yes. Yes.
Where is he going?
I said one thing about the guy.
He's got guts.
I mean the other day I was watching
this some x-sport show...
Stuart, can you please stop talking
about Johnny Blaze already?
Yeah. That might be a little hard.
I made it.
Pull over.
You want me to pull over?
Drive.
-Driving.
Come on, Roxanne.
I need to talk to you.
What's your name?
-What?
What's your name?
-Oh, Stuart.
Johnny.
-Hi.
Well, Stuart, can you help me
outta here?
Sorry, dude. She's the boss.
Johnny, look out.
Alright. I guess I see
how it's gonna be.
Hang on.
Howdy. Howdy. Howdy.
Are you trying to kill yourself?
I wanna talk to you. I haven't seen you
is 56,000 years.
This is crazy. You are crazy.
You know Johnny,
I don't have time for this.
I have a story to edit.
You couldn't say no.
When I ask you to marry me.
You could've said no.
What are you trying to say?
I’m not trying to say anything.
I’m saying I mean something.
Sorry.
-You got my numbers, son.
You're on the side of the freeway.
Let's get some dinner.
You still like attalia?
What's this about, Johnny?
You want some closure?
Look, you were 17, and you witnessed
a tragedy and you ran.
I understand now
like I understood then.
And I have no hard feelings,
none, you know.
That's why they call it the past.
Cause it's past. It’s done. It’s over.
Too much?
There's a restaurant in my hotel,
The Plazuer.
-Yes.
Don't be late.
-This is the sun, Roxanne.
There are no accidents.
Destiny and all that.
Johnny, Johnny, can you please sign
my sister's book?
Mephistopheles.
I knew you'd come.
Long time no see, boys.
Where you been hiding?
I know why you're here.
I know what you're after.
It’s my contract.
They're my souls.
We both know you can't harm me here.
It’s my turn to lead.
You will suffer for this.
Now, deal with my rider.
Your favourite creation.
Send your precious rider.
I will retire him, just like,
I will retire you. Father.
You can't live in fear.
You can't live in fear.
You made a job
no one's made their job.
You're the best rider.
You deserve a second chance.
She's a sun.
Okay.
Johnny.
Stay away from me.
A little late for that.
Nice bike. Yeah.
Why are you here?
Oh, I’ve always been here, Johnny.
All along.
Phoenix. Tender. Justin.
-It was you.
Keeping me alive.
-No. No, Johnny.
It’s all you. You're the best.
And I am your greatest fan.
Posters. The video games.
The crowds. Screaming. Chanting.
Johnny. Johnny.
Johnny.
You make me so proud.
It’s like watching an investment
that keeps growing, and growing,
Until the day, you cash it in.
That day's the day, Johnny.
Find the one known as Blackheart.
And destroy him.
Find him yourself.
It doesn't work like that.
You're under contract, remember.
lf you succeed,
I’ll return your soul.
I’m not doing it.
You don't have any choice.
Hey.
You can't come in here.
This is private...
Property.
There is a cemetery here.
-Yeah. Long time ago.
What happened to the grave?
They move them.
-Where?
I don't know.
-Who would?
St Michael's Church.
They're in charge of the whole thing.
Look, you really shouldn't be here.
That's what they keep telling me.
Oh God!
Oh God!
Looking for someone?
Back to hell.
We're not gonna have a meaning
for conversation now, are we?
You're going down.
I don't think so.
He ain't so tough.
Hey, do it back.
Have mercy.
Sorry, all out of mercy.
Help me.
Wait.
You think I’m pretty right?
Give me the damn bag.
-Help!
Help!
Thanks.
You guilty.
Look into my eyes.
Your soul is stain
by the blood of the innocents.
Feel their pain.
Let me go!
Morning, Bone Head.
They've seen you now.
They'll be waiting for you.
lf you need my help,
expect the last of that.
Last time another stranger help me,
I didn't pay an ass of it.
Said son you can't ran from, kid.
He'd still be coming
since you made that deal.
Congratulations.
Chances this weapon mind the smill.
Sources close to the investigations
say that there maybe a link...
...between what happened here in downtown...
Are the broken book's
massacre in the desert.
I’m Roxanne Simpson, on scene.
-And we're out.
Captain Dolan.
-No comment.
Is it true they found a connection
between the biker bar massacre...
...and last night victims
here in the city train yards?
No comment.
Off the record, captain.
Off the record?
Piss off.
Rider's are devil’s baddier.
Sent to hunt down anyone
escape from hell.
Sterilize that for me.
Sterilize.
In boiling water.
-Right.
Lock in fears.
During the day you'll be normal.
In the night, in the presence of evil,
the rider takes over.
I remember now.
Last night...
There was some punk and I could see
all the wrong he ever done.
Turn it all against him.
The blood in stare.
Shear the souls in looking.
It’s the ghost rider greatest weapon.
All the riders have it.
And there are others, guess not,
ghost rider problem?
Yes, it is.
Last one was a 150 years ago.
It will take all shame and guns,
just down.
There's people.
Guess the rider kill all
who make the promises.
On due at the time,
consumed by greed,
They turned over another.
Until the villagers send them Gods
are drowned in it’s own blood.
Souls. Slept forever
in God's forsaken place.
What's this has to do with Blackheart?
Blackheart?
He sent you out for Blackheart?
And others?
-They're hidden.
All the name that was cast
out of hell in brime.
Save Michael himself.
They hide within the other months.
Waiting. For the end of days.
You better hang around here, kid.
They kept come on the hell of ground.
Thanks.
And thanks for the info.
I feel much better now that I know
the devil’s bound to other.
Where you going?
-Somebody I gotta see.
It’s a bad idea.
Wouldn't be my first.
How did you do it?
How did you make the deal?
I was a kid.
-What did you get in return?
Heartache.
Oh my God.
It’s hard to describe the destruction...
Could you tell us about
the good Samaritan?
Oh, I’ll never forget him
that's for sure.
He was tall, broad shoulders,
and thin, very thin, like boney.
And he have this red chopper
that was on flame and stuff.
Oh, and his face was a skull,
and it was on fire.
On fire?
-Yeah, like...
Like that much fire.
And I know it sounds weird,
But it look okay on him.
I mean, it was an edge look,
but he totally pull it off.
Not sure what's had to that.
I’m Roxanne Simpson, on scene.
Thanks.
Roxy.
-Don't.
You know, hold on a second.
Let me apologize.
Last night was an excusable.
-No apology.
See. You did me a favour last night.
Because you make me think of then,
now and when you left.
Yeah. Great like hell.
But you know what?
I got over it.
I went to college. I got a great job.
But you, Johnny...
You're just the same.
Oh, better pay, and more fans.
But you're still just a carnie.
Yeah.
-Oh, man.
My dad was right.
You're just a fiends.
Melt like well.
Hey, Captain. I got something.
On the days.
A host can gain control the possessing
spirit through concentration on...
...a manipulation of the fire element
and exists within man.
Now I’m speaking to the fire element
within me.
Give me control
for the possessing spirit.
Hi.
-Hi.
Hey. I hope you don't mind.
Your lift was open.
Wow.
I came to apologize.
I’m leaving town tonight, and...
I didn't want what I said today
to be the last words between us.
That's okay.
-No, it's not.
It was cruel, and totally untrue,
and I feel very terrible about it.
Please, don't. It’s okay.
Something burning?
Oh, it must be coming from outside.
Neighbours of Achi. Bill.
He just got it.
I still have that one.
-You what?
I have that one too.
I remember that day.
There are dozen people waiting in line...
And you went through
whole broad of corders.
Look at my face,
you could tell it's just...
Terrified that my dad
was going to come in any second.
You're just...
Maybe I should walk you to your car.
This is not a good time.
You almost kill yourself on the highway
so you can ask me out,
And then you don't show.
Then keep my picture...
But when I kiss you,
you try to shove me out the door.
What's... what's going on?
Don't you care about me at all, Johnny?
You know you can talk to me.
You can tell me anything.
Please.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.
Try me.
-Oh, you'll think I’m crazy.
Maybe I am crazy.
I hope I’m crazy.
In my job, I’ve seen and heard
just about everything.
So there is nothing you can tell me
that's gonna surprise me.
Off the record?
Yeah.
I sold my soul to devil.
Ahem.
You knew I have to spare you.
Spare me from what?
-The devil.
On account, I work for him.
That's why I can't make it to dinner.
Because you're working...
For the devil?
Yeah.
I’m his bounty hunter.
It only happens at night.
Like it is right now.
When I’m on around evil,
evil people, evil spirits...
I change into...
-What?
Just a creepy monster.
But I am learning to,
I’m getting control of it...
Trying to.
So tonight? You'll...
I believe so.
Which is why it's probably
a very good idea that you...
You run on home now, Roxanne.
You're serious?
So this is... this is your excuse?
For the past? For last night?
For everything? -Uhuh.
Um, lastly that I got a couple
of choices.
I can either accept that you really
believe what you're telling me is true,
And take you to the nearest
psychiatric hospital.
You see, now there...
-Or...
I realize that you rather make up
ridiculous stories...
...than be honest with me.
And I walk out that door, forever.
Don't move.
Stay right there.
Hands over your head.
Johnny Blaze.
Yeah. Captain Jack Dolan.
This is Officer Edwards.
You're coming with us.
Okay.
Let's try this again.
What about him?
You remember him?
This guy was 3 years from retirement,
you're harm to flame his life.
In fact, neither that most of the corpse
has turn in since you came home,
You son of a bitch.
I didn't kill anybody.
-Bullshit.
Okay. Let's take a breather.
It's warm in here.
-Warm?
Yeah, I’m burning up. Aren't you?
-No.
You want a cigarette?
Okay.
Mind if I do?
I told you that was weird.
Look, Johnny.
I’m not asking for your help.
I’m asking you to help yourself.
I watch a lot of TV.
And I know what you're doing.
But you both good cops

Go out to make a best
Is said the west is build our legend
and the legend a weird understanding
than greater that ourselves
forces to ship our life

Individual who life soul today
haven or fall to the earth
This is how legend a born
-The End-
