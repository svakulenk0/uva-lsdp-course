KHYAN: It's true,
the Hittite army
has 16,000 troops
camped outside Kadesh.
What's less clear is why.
The Hittites are trying
to cross the border.
Obviously.
What else would
they be doing?
KHYAN: Anticipating
an invasion by us,
according to our information.
They think we are...
preparing an attack,
which we are not.
What I don't want
to do, and won't do,
is sit here...
and wait until we're
fighting Hittite armies...
outside the palace walls.
Come.
What do the entrails say?
They don't
"say" anything.
They imply.
And that's open
to interpretation.
SETI: So, interpret them.
We'll win or we won't
in a preemptive attack?
It's a yes or a no.
And it's not clear.
But something else is.
In the battle,
a leader will be saved...
and his savior
will someday lead.
Then the entrails
should also say...
that we will
abandon reason...
and be guided by omens.
Great Sekhmet...
Pharaoh drinks
in your name...
and prays for victory
over the Hittites at Kadesh.
Your first order of business when
the time comes, you retire her.
I will.
I don't know why
my father hasn't.
But, just in case...
if you see me in any real danger
out there, ride the other way.
I'm serious.
SETI: When I look at you,
I still see the two boys...
who grew up together,
close as brothers.
If, for any reason...
you ever forget that...
let these remind you.
Long enough to be effective
from horseback...
not so long that
you trip over them.
This is his.
You've got mine.
That's right.
That's how I want it.
You have each other's...
to keep each other safe.
Promise me you'll do that...
always.
Oh...
ALL:
Seti! Seti! Seti!
Seti!
There!
Deploy Amun division
to the north,
Ra division to the center...
and Ptah to the south.
And we hold Seth in reserve.
In reserve?
Yes.
We should concentrate
our strength in the center.
You should concentrate
yours on fighting.
Leave the generalship
to me.
Fire!
Fire!
Charge!
Take Ramses! Go!
Go!
Turn around!
Turn around!
PEOPLE:
Moses! Moses! Moses!
Moses.
What happened out there?
Nothing.
I asked the commanders
the same thing.
They, too, lied.
And I'm tired of it.
He thinks something happened.
But it didn't.
Meaning?
The High Priestess,
her prophecy.
She said she couldn't see
who would win.
The other one.
"The leader will be saved..."
and so on.
You saved my son's life?
Yes.
Sit.
"Thank you" is
not sufficient...
but thank you.
I know you don't believe
in omens or prophecies...
but I do believe.
And I respect that.
But this isn't anything.
This doesn't
even make any sense.
Because you're not
my blood.
Yes.
It's true,
you can't succeed me.
Not in the usual way.
Not in any way.
In any way imaginable,
sitting here.
It's horrible to say this
about one's own son...
but I trust you
more than him to lead.
"The Hittite chariotry...
"crashed through our defense
and began its attack.
"I found myself
surrounded by the enemy...
"no soldier,
no shield-bearer...
"facing a desperate
fight for my life.
"Only with
the help of the gods...
"did I defeat
our attackers...
"and rejoin Ra division."
Stop there.
Anything you'd
like to rephrase?
No.
Shall I go on?
No, I'm sure the rest is fine.
What's next?
GRAND VIZIER: Pithom.
SETI: What about it?
The situation.
The slaves.
Fine. Ramses.
What?
Go up there,
meet with the viceroy,
look around, make a report.
Me?
It will be yours someday.
Take an interest in it.
What else?
I'll go to see the viceroy.
RAMSES: No.
I'll go.
It's beneath you.
It's beneath any general.
I'll do it.
Ramses...
can we forget
what happened...
on the battlefield?
If our positions
had been reversed...
I would've saved
your life, too.
I know.
I know.
It was a good shot.
Even if the gods
did guide your aim.
A little venom in your
blood is a good thing.
Makes you less vulnerable
to the next poisonous bite.
Maybe even my father's.
Welcome to Pithom.
You get used to the smell.
MOSES: The viceroy seems
to be enjoying a good share
of his resources.
This isn't a job everyone
wants to do, my lord.
A certain degree of comfort is
necessary to keep up his spirits.
HEGEP: You know
what the problem is?
People live too long
these days.
Every year, the death rate lags
further behind the birth rate.
And these people...
they reproduce
like it's a sport.
This is the problem?
A growing work force?
Oh, no. No, of course not.
It's good for production.
Of course it is,
but only to a point.
When that population
wants you dead...
yes, it's a problem.
So, either I'm given more
troops to maintain order...
or I start
thinning out the herd.
You start
slaughtering people...
for no reason other than
this precarious theory...
you will provoke the very thing
you say you wish to avoid.
Fine,
then give me the troops.
Let's go down
and talk to them.
Why on earth?
You're worried
about sedition.
Let's find out if
that worry is real.
By talking to them?
By looking at them...
when I talk with them.
You can tell a lot
about somebody...
looking him in the eye.
Well, let me
tell you something...
about Hebrews.
They are a conniving,
combative people.
Do you know what
"lsraelite" means...
in their own language?
"He who fights with God."
"He who wrestles with God."
There is a difference.
I may not be as
educated as you,
which, apparently,
you want to remind me of.
But I have to deal
with them every day.
I know what I'm talking about.
You don't have to come.
I'll go down there myself.
MOSES: Stop!
Why is he being punished?
Persistent troublemaker,
my lord.
MOSES: Why is he smiling?
He says he feels
no pain, my lord.
Then why whip him?
You were not
gathered up at random.
I asked to see...
the elders.
Come on.
What do you pray for?
We pray to see Canaan again.
MOSES: Canaan again?
You've never seen it.
I've seen Canaan.
I've seen that it's
inhabited by tribes fiercer
than Egypt's military.
So, you won't be
returning to it...
or, if you do, from it.
God says otherwise.
MOSES: Which god?
Your god?
The God of Abraham?
The god that says
that you are special?
That you are chosen?
Come here. Up.
Come here.
He's wrong.
I can see you're unconvinced,
and that's a problem.
Because next to unrealistic
belief lies fanaticism...
and next to that, sedition,
and next to that, revolution.
And it all starts
with the elders.
What's your name?
What's yours?
MOSES: I'll tell you.
I am Moses, son of Bithia...
grandson of Horemheb.
Record this one's name
and the rest of them.
Bring in the next group.
My name is Nun.
JOSHUA: My lord!
GUARD: Stop there!
Let him through.
There's something
the elder has to tell you.
But not here.
Say where and when.
The prayer house, tonight.
Here.
HEGEP: I see you've
survived your adventure.
Sorry to make
you wait again.
I'm not waiting.
How was your
trip to the quarry?
Fine.
You saw what
I'm up against.
Mmm.
Tell me...
is there any
more of my records
I could get for
you before you leave?
You can tell me...
has all of this
been reported to Memphis?
Was it approved?
Do you have it in writing?
Of course.
It's on record.
So you don't mind
if we check?
Of course I don't mind.
But I don't understand
what's gone wrong.
Have I done something
to displease you?
And if so, is there any way
I could please you?
You can stop
living like a king.
You're not one.
NUN: "...and you will occupy
the land of Canaan."
JOSHUA:
Canaan is already occupied.
NUN: God promises
we will return.
JOSHUA:
In chains or in coffins?
NUN: As free men...
into a land flowing
with milk and honey.
Can they at least
wait outside?
We're not dangerous.
MOSES: Wait by the horses.
Do you believe in coincidence?
As much as anything else.
I don't think this is one.
What isn't?
You coming to Pithom.
Why did you come?
Business.
Sit.
Who's your father?
I know you don't
know his name...
only that he was a general
in Pharaoh's army...
unnamed by your mother.
I can see this is making
you uncomfortable.
This will interest you.
There was no general.
Your mother...
the woman you
call your mother,
has no children.
You were born a slave.
Don't go.
Don't go.
It's better for you that I do.
I'm leaving.
If you leave now,
you'll just come back...
because you know
something's wrong.
You've always felt it.
Please.
Everybody out.
Out.
The year of your birth...
there was a prophecy that
our leader would be born...
to liberate us
from our bondage.
And so, there was an edict
from Memphis...
to kill every
firstborn Hebrew boy.
Your parents didn't wait
for that to happen.
Any chance of your survival
was better than no chance.
They handed you
to your sister.
She took you in a basket
to the banks of the river...
and she floated you
to where she knew...
Pharaoh Paramesse's daughter,
Bithia, bathed.
Bithia took you
and your sister,
Miriam, as a maid...
and raised you as her own.
She probably
even loved you...
but she never told you,
or anyone else, the truth.
You are Hebrew.
The truth?
The truth is,
it's not even
that good a story.
And I thought you people
were meant to be...
good storytellers.
GUARD: You, slave.
You!
Do you expect a reward
for this information?
Our reward is being
of service to you.
That said, if there were...
some token you had in mind
beyond that...
we wouldn't refuse it.
Well, how about this, then?
What about
if I don't kill you?
Hmm?
That would be
sufficient payment.
You people.
Please leave.
SETI:  Please.
How did it go?
We can talk about
that another time.
We can talk about it now...
if only as a respite
from this army
of grim-faced physicians.
Sit.
We're taking a thorough look
at the city records...
and the man is
clearly a thief.
It's one of life's
more depressing ironies...
that the men
who crave power...
are best fitted
to acquire it,
and least fitted
to exercise it.
What's wrong, Moses?
You're sick.
Something else
is troubling you.
I can tell.
No, nothing else.
RAMSES: May you be alert...
rejuvenated and
protected by the gods...
every moment of
your eternal life.
RAMSES: And to the left.
No, your left.
More, more, more.
Good.
It is tall.
Monuments are monuments...
for a reason. They inspire.
Inspire what,
in this case?
In this,
and in every case, power.
Say it out loud,
whatever it is.
The Viceroy of Pithom
is outside.
He's not on the agenda.
Well, he can go back
to Pithom until he is.
No, we should
deal with this.
Bring him in.
If you came here to beg
the new king's forgiveness...
it won't work.
Arrest him.
Oh.
Wait, please.
May I at least respond?
I beg you.
It's in your interest.
You make it short.
I will...
to the king alone.
My advice is that...
he, and the other generals,
also leave the room.
MOSES: Really?
That's your advice?
Hmm.
Well,
you are not his advisor.
Oh, that's right.
You are.
That's right.
RAMSES: Moses.
Moses.
Everybody but the Viceroy...
out.
Terrible news.
There you are.
So...
Mmm?
The Viceroy.
You didn't arrest him.
You didn't take
your Chief Advisor's advice.
No, he came. Uh...
He told me of an incident
involving two guards...
one of which
survived the attack.
And I told him
I did not care.
And then, he told me
the most unbelievable story.
Told to him, he said,
by very reliable sources.
Then, when pressed...
he admitted that
they were Hebrew spies.
You know what
I'm talking about.
Yes.
And what do you make of it?
I think it's offensive,
and I think it's ridiculous.
RAMSES: Yes. Yes!
You, of all people, a Hebrew.
And I said...
how can I believe
such a story?
Cousin...
you can't.
What if I take the chance
of not believing it, Moses?
What am I to do?
Bithia!
MOSES: Mother.
The man is a thief.
My son discovers this.
Not you.
And he reports it
to your father,
who would have
hanged this thief...
if he hadn't
been dying himself.
You believe his feeble,
self-serving lies.
All I want to know
is if it is true.
I didn't ask for a tirade.
To talk about
this any longer...
would dignify it...
and I won't do that.
TUYA: Answer the question.
Yes or no?
Was I talking to you?
Bring her in.
Bring her in.
Now!
Miriam!
Come.
Sit down.
Now, I'm going to
ask you some things...
that are going to seem
very strange to you.
I just would like you
to answer them truthfully.
How do you know Moses?
You know how I know him...
and you.
I helped raise you both.
So you are not
his sister, then?
Of course not.
And you're not a Hebrew.
No.
Place your arm on the table.
Ramses...
Don't be stupid!
I am not talking to you!
I am talking to her.
Your whole arm
on the table, Miriam.
Thank you.
Ramses...
don't take this any further.
Don't take this
any further, or what?
Do not take this
any further.
Are you quite sure
about that?
Get your hand off it,
or use it, now.
Or perhaps you'd like
to answer the question?
Then I'll proceed.
Miriam, I'm going
to ask you again...
and if your answer
is again no...
I apologize for
what happens next.
Are you his sister?
No.
Yes!
Yes!
You don't need a reason to
kill him, but you have one.
This was treason.
How was it treason?
He just admitted he knew.
That wasn't an admission!
Simply did not want
her arm lopped off!
I saw it in his eyes.
He does not
believe this story.
I don't want to believe it!
You want to believe it,
because it's an opportunity
to be rid of him...
which you always wanted.
I didn't say "exiled,"
I said "dead."
That, I'm sure,
will follow...
where he's going.
MOSES: Khyan...
allow me to talk to my mother.
Yes, sir, yes.
BITHIA: Come, Miriam.
It isn't every man
who would protect
a servant who's nothing
more to him than that.
Certainly no one
else in this family...
including me.
I wouldn't have said
what he wanted to hear.
And neither would she.
That's how much
we love you.
It's not true.
It is true.
You were wearing this when
I brought you to the river.
I took it off you
for obvious reasons.
That's you.
The connection between
you and our mother.
Your sister saved your life.
Now you saved hers...
Moshe.
MOSES: Miriam.
Sorry, sir.
Moses!
ALL: Moses!
I have nothing to steal.
My horse is dead.
We're not here for
your horse, Moshe.
A little bit higher.
MALE DROVER 1: Hey! Whoa.
What are you doing?
Don't stop.
Keep working.
MALE DROVER 2: You,
get water for our goats.
MALE DROVER 1: Psst. You.
Wait your turn.
Move your animals
away from the troughs.
It's yours again.
JETHRO: Where are you from?
West of here.
Where are you going?
MOSES: East.
What did you do?
What do you mean?
You committed some crime?
With respect...
your daughters
invited me for some food.
They did not tell me there
would be an interrogation.
I'm sorry.
I'm just curious.
You are welcome to get
cleaned up before dinner...
if that appeals to you...
and stay the night
if you want...
before continuing on...
to wherever it is.
MOSES: Thank you.
Describe Memphis to someone...
who's never been there
and never will.
It's...
I don't want to
say "civilized"...
because I don't want to
offend, but it is civilized.
There's more there
than sheep and goats.
There's more here than that.
Really?
Where?
I'm sorry,
that was rude.
That was rude.
I'm not ignorant
just because I live here.
Hmm.
I can see that.
I can tell you one thing.
This is by far...
the nicest place...
between here and there.
And so you're leaving?
Of course.
There's nothing here
for someone like me.
When?
Today?
JETHRO: Remember
this moment in time...
for after these vows...
you shall say to the world...
"This is my husband."
"This is my wife."
I, Zipporah...
I, Moses...
accept you, Zipporah...
accept you, Moses...
BOTH: ...to be no other
than yourself.
Loving what I know of you...
trusting what I
do not yet know.
With respect...
for your integrity...
and faith...
in your abiding love for me.
In all that life
may bring us...
Who makes you happy?
You do.
What's the most important
thing in your life?
You are.
Where would you rather be?
Nowhere.
And when will you leave me?
Never
Proceed.
I said "per se."
I don't want to
discuss my tomb, per se.
I want to discuss
why you seem to want
to discuss it all the time.
Respectfully...
it should have been your
first construction order
on taking the throne.
It'll be a big project,
as you might imagine.
So is my house, apparently.
ARCHITECT:
Is there a problem
with the palace?
It's not done.
ARCHITECT:
It won't be long now.
You said that months ago.
Meanwhile
I'm living there like...
a Bedouin.
Get it done.
Faster!
Or do I have to
kill somebody?
I think
you made your point.
GERSHOM:
Good throw, Father.
MOSES:
Just aim a little higher.
Almost.
Ugh.
GERSHOM: Have you ever
been to the top?
No.
Would you like to?
Mother says it's forbidden.
By who?
Our god.
Our god...
stops us from
climbing mountains?
Not every mountain.
Just that one.
It's God's mountain.
You're confusing him.
I'm not trying to.
Is it good for our boy to
grow up believing in nothing?
Is it bad to grow up
believing in yourself?
It's my faith.
I know.
And it's his, too.
I understand.
He can make up his
mind when he's older.
Yes.
Just like you.
He's a lot like me already.
MOSES:
Hey, hey!
Hey! Hey!
BOY:  Moshe.
Help me!
I think my leg is broken.
More than that.
What did you say?
Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm a shepherd.
I thought you were a general.
I need a general.
Why?
To fight.
Why else?
Fight who?
For what?
I think you know.
I think you should go and see
what's happening
to your people now.
He won't be at peace
until you do.
Or are they not people...
in your opinion?
Who are you?
I am.
ZIPPORAH:
You were hit on the head.
Anything you saw...
or think you saw afterwards...
was an effect of that.
The storm...
The storm started before
I was hit on the head.
It was not a storm.
Fine, fine.
The storm was something.
It was something else.
But the boy was
all in your head.
How do you know?
Because God isn't a boy!
Then what does he look like?
Describe him.
Describe him to
someone like me.
Do you know what
you sound like?
Yes.
I sound delusional.
Yes.
Yes.
You just need more rest.
Yes, yes.
I have to
tell you something.
I have to
tell you something.
I've not been
completely honest with you.
About what?
About who I am.
About what I've done
and who I was.
And how I feel.
About what you feel about me?
No.
No,
I've been honest about that.
Rest.
Rest.
Don't leave me.
No. No.
MOSES: Moshe.
Gershom?
What are you doing out here?
GERSHOM: Nothing.
I can't sleep.
Are you worried about me?
GERSHOM: Yes.
Don't.
I'll be fine.
What's that?
What's it look like?
Come inside.
Come inside!
What are you going to do
with all that?
Make sure I see you again.
Put it down and you can
see me forever.
What's this mean?
It's someone I used to know.
This is not forever.
I will see you again.
Do you believe me?
Good for you.
Don't ever just say
what people want to hear.
But I will...
I will see you again.
Will you keep this for me?
Gershom.
Gershom, please look at me.
What kind of god
tells a man...
to leave his family?
If you understand it,
I'll understand it.
I don't.
So I can't
answer that question.
If that's what faith means,
I will trade mine...
to keep you.
Don't touch me.
Go.
Go!
MOSES: Father, have you
some milk to spare?
Yes.
Where did you come from?
I come from the sea.
It's a narrow
and dangerous path.
Thank you, Father.
MOSES: Joshua.
I remember you.
Do you still feel no pain?
Keep your eye
on the horse.
MOSES:
Thank you.
Welcome back, brother.
Aaron...
your brother.
lthamar, this...
is your famous Uncle Moses.
He was once
a prince of Egypt.
I'm fine.
Everybody's fine.
You sleep so well,
my boy...
because you know
you are loved.
I've never slept so well.
I'm told
I should address you...
as Ramses the Great, now.
Moses...
you're alive.
I'm glad you're alive.
Really?
Is that why you only sent
two assassins to kill me?
My mother.
Don't blame her.
Yes, she wanted you dead.
Who do you think
hid your sword
where you would find it?
Moses.
I'm not here...
to take your throne.
It's not about the prophecy
that worries you so much.
This is something else.
I have been told...
that things here
have become...
much worse.
Things are better than
they ever have been, Moses.
No.
We have order.
Order?
The slaves...
their bodies burn
night and day now.
I've seen it
with my own eyes.
You call that order?
They're slaves.
No, they're not.
What would you expect?
They're Egyptians,
they should be
treated as Egyptians.
They should have
the same rights...
they should be
paid for their work...
or you must set them free.
They are not Egyptians.
They are slaves, Moses.
What else do you expect?
They wouldn't
know what to do...
if all of a sudden
they were left
to fend for themselves
like animals.
Do not call them animals!
Listen, from an economic
standpoint alone...
what you're asking...
is problematic
to say the least.
I didn't expect to
hear a simple yes.
But I do not want
to hear a simple no.
Is that what you
are telling me?
Are you saying no?
I'm not saying no.
I'm saying time.
Time.
You're listening to Hebrews.
I'm not listening to Hebrews.
Who are you talking to?
God.
God.
Which god?
You're not seriously
considering his proposal.
Well, is it a proposal?
If a man is holding a dagger
to your throat, Minister?
Is it?
I stand corrected.
That's a demand.
RAMSES:
He has lost his mind.
He's found a god.
His god.
Not one of ours...
so I would like Moses...
I want Moses dead.
Did you hear me?
Yes.
Then, go.
And...
his family, too.
Moses.
Where's Moses?
Moses?
Where's Moses?
Moses...
his family.
Where are they?
This is not Moses.
This is not his family.
This is a man...
his wife...
and his child...
who when asked the simple
question, "Where is he?"...
answered, "We don't know."
Carry this image
home with you tonight...
and discuss why
you would protect him...
knowing that
tomorrow at this time...
there will be
another family...
where this one is.
And another the day after.
And the day after that.
Dare I say yours?
Go ahead.
I want to join the fight.
In there.
Joshua, use your knee.
It's good.
Both eyes open!
Nock!
Draw!
Loose!
Advance.
Nock. Draw.
Loose!
Draw!
Loose!
Draw!
Loose!
Again!
MOSES: There are
two kinds of warfare.
Each is dictated by numbers.
With greater numbers...
you attack the enemy
head on!
You stab it in the heart!
With fewer numbers,
you come at it from the side.
You cut off the blood...
that pumps the heart.
The army supply lines.
No!
The people's supply lines.
Their food...
their property...
their comfort.
What would that achieve?
Everything.
Only the Egyptian people...
can force him
to accept our demands...
for freedom.
We must force them...
to make him say yes!
Yes?
SLAVES: Yes!
MOSES: Yes?
SLAVES: Yes!
MOSES: With me!
With me!
Ready.
You're not going
to do anything?
I didn't say that.
Where have you been?
Watching you fail.
Wars of attrition
take time.
At this rate,
you'll take years...
a generation.
I am prepared to
fight for that long.
I'm not.
MOSES: I thought we were
making progress.
Now, you're impatient.
After 400 years of slavery.
Am I the only one sitting
here who's done nothing
about this until now?
I do know...
a few things
about military action.
Still, if you're not going
to listen to me...
then why did you
take me away...
from my family?
I didn't.
You did.
You don't need me.
Maybe not.
So what do I do?
Nothing?
For now...
you can watch.
HIGH PRIESTESS:
Divine Goddess Kebechet,
I humbly call upon you...
to purify the waters
of our life-giving river.
How long will it take?
Not long.
But longer than that.
Ramses!
Ramses!
RAMSES: Yes?
Enough!
Do something!
They're just frogs.
Back away, back away.
SLAVE 2: Unclean.
No, no, no.
Don't drink.
Unclean.
MAN: The Nile, as we know, carries
a certain amount of clay.
This year there's much
more of it than usual...
drifting in on the currents,
settling on the riverbeds...
and kicked up by the wild
thrashing of the crocodiles.
This thrashing not only...
dramatically changed the color of
the water, but it fouled it...
to the point of
killing the fish.
But frogs, as we know...
can get out of the water,
when they have to.
Which they did.
But frogs still need water...
and when they can't find it
in the streets of our city...
they what?
Hmm?
Oh, they die?
They die!
And then they decompose.
And then the gnats come
and the maggots come
and the flies come.
And then...
And then what?
The flies die.
RAMSES: Speak up.
It's in Hebrew.
Hebrew?
Read it.
"These catastrophes...
"are the work of God...
"and they have not finished.
They will get worse.
"We need to
reach a settlement...
"for both our sakes."
So, the work of God.
RAMSES: Here is
my settlement to you.
Work quotas
shall be doubled...
and you will get no straw...
to make your bricks.
Perhaps your god...
will provide it for you.
I was impressed at first.
Not anymore.
This is affecting everyone.
So, who are you punishing?
MAN: What's wrong with him?
MAN 2: It's sick.
What is this?
Did you do this?
Not me.
Is this you?
No, no!
What's happened to him?
Oh! Oh...
We have made great
strides in medicine.
However, there are
still a few hidden diseases
that we don't
completely understand.
Animals are not exempt...
and there is
some conjecture...
that these maladies can migrate
from the smallest creature.
Like a...
A fly.
Have you been out
to the river lately?
I appealed to
Kebechet again...
and six more gods.
Is that it?
Are you done?
I am.
Are you trying to say
something with your absence?
Is it meant to humble me?
Because it will not!
SCRIBE:
Initial reports suggest...
more than 10 million square
cubits of crops have been lost.
The quartermaster has suggested
we return a portion...
of the supplement
to the civil granary.
An act of mercy.
Your people are starving.
Are you suggesting
that I should starve, too?
No.
People have plenty of water.
They will endure.
Aim!
Fire!
Aim!
Fire!
Is that you?
Moses?
Brother?
Have you come to negotiate?
Because I'm ready...
as I have an offer for you.
One more thing happens...
and I will bring
my own plague to you.
You see,
every Hebrew child...
not yet walking...
they never shall.
Because I will
drown them in the Nile.
As you should have been.
You say that you
didn't cause all this?
Your god did?
I am the god!
I am the god!
So, let's just see who's
more effective at killing.
You.
This god.
Or me.
Nice of you to come.
He's given you
what you asked?
Not yet. But his own people
are turning against him.
And his army?
It will.
I disagree.
Something worse
has to happen.
I disagree.
Anything more would be...
Would be what?
What were you about to say?
Cruel?
Inhumane?
It's not easy to see...
the people who I grew up
with suffering this much.
What about the people
you didn't grow up with?
What thought did
you give to them?
You still don't think
of them as yours, do you?
As long as Ramses
has an army behind him...
nothing will change.
Anything more
is just revenge!
Revenge?
After 400 years of
brutal subjugation?
These Pharaohs who
imagine they're living gods,
they're nothing more
than flesh and blood.
I want to see them on their
knees, begging for it to stop!
I'm tired of talking
with a messenger!
General!
I have heard
Ramses' final threat.
So, let me tell you what's
going to happen next.
MOSES: No. No.
You cannot do this.
I want no part of this!
KHYAN: Stay!
Hold!
SOLDIER: Moses?
Leave him.
Khyan.
Moses.
I could have you killed.
I don't think so.
Unless you do it yourself.
Your own soldiers
let me in.
I am not
negotiating anymore.
That's not why I'm here.
I came to tell you
that something is coming...
that is out of my control.
Something that will
affect thousands...
and thousands of citizens.
And it will affect
you very personally
unless you accept
what I've asked for...
and announce it publicly...
before the sun goes down.
Ramses...
do not turn your back on me!
This has nothing to
do with you and I.
This is far beyond that.
This is about
Egypt's survival.
Do you understand?
Sunset.
After that,
it will be too late.
What will be too late?
You protect your child.
You protect
your child tonight.
My child?
Is that a threat?
Is that a threat?
Moses!
Moses!
Tell everyone...
to slaughter a lamb...
and mark their doors...
and their
doorposts tonight...
with its blood.
Why?
Pity the lambs if I am wrong.
If I'm right...
we will bless them
for eternity.
Bennu?
Bennu?
RAMSES: No!
Ramses?
Ramses.
Ramses.
No!
WOMAN: Zechariah?
Zechariah?
MAN 1: Get out!
MAN 2: Murderer!
MAN 3: Child killer!
Their children
died last night.
As did mine.
Is this your god?
A killer of children?
What kind of fanatics
worship such a god?
No Hebrew child
died last night.
Get...
out.
Go.
Every one of you!
Go!
Go to Canaan if
that's what you want.
Back to the homeland
of your dreams.
But go!
As you command.
MOSES:
This is the route I took.
From here,
we go south to the Red Sea.
The straits are here.
At low tide,
we can cross on foot.
You know why you
sleep so well, my boy?
Because you know
you are loved.
HEGEP: With respect...
if we're going to
recapture 400,000 slaves...
we might need more
than three divisions.
We're not
recapturing anyone.
Forward!
We should rest.
No.
We're not safe
until we cross the sea.
AARON: Moshe!
Whoa!
Ramses...
a thousand chariots.
How far behind us?
Four days.
Less, if they don't
rest the horses.
KHYAN: Ramses!
Ramses!
We need to rest
the horses...
and the men!
The straits are that way.
The longest,
easiest route...
is down the western coast.
Or we go through
the mountains.
AARON: The mountains?
Why? Why don't
we take that route?
We can, but so can Ramses.
The mountain passes
are dangerous...
but they are too narrow
for Ramses' chariots.
He couldn't follow.
That would give us
needed time.
What does God tell you?
The mountains.
AARON: Can we make it?
Forward!
Which way from here?
Stay here.
We need your help.
I don't know where I am.
You won't help me?
You won't help them.
This way!
Move out!
RAMSES: This way!
Are you sure?
Oh, I'm very sure.
I mean, are you sure
we can make it across
with our equipment...
our chariots?
They didn't think
they could with theirs.
RAMSES: How would they know?
They've never been here.
Moses may have.
Is this high tide
or low tide?
Doesn't matter.
This isn't
the straits, is it?
No.
AARON: Do you even know
where we are?
Yes!
We're at a point
on the earth where
there is a sea ahead...
and an army behind!
So now what?
Army or no army...
we have to rest.
I have misled all of them.
I have abandoned my family.
I have failed you.
I'm not what I thought I was.
What is it?
The current.
It's strong.
We need to cross here.
We need to cross now!
We cross here.
We cross here!
Ready yourselves!
We cross here!
Go tell them! Go!
Your orders...
are like the lash
of the Egyptian whip.
We are no longer slaves.
And yet, you are not free.
You have lost sight...
of Canaan...
land of your forebears.
You have honored me...
with your trust.
Now I honor you
with my faith.
Follow me and
you will be free!
Stay and you will perish.
Do not be afraid!
God is with us!
Go!
Ready yourselves!
Go!
God is with us!
AARON: Pass the word!
We cross here!
As quickly as you can,
gather your things...
and form in groups!
Quickly!
Come on!
Steady!
To the right,
to the right! Tight!
AARON: Keep moving!
There's nothing to fear!
AARON: Don't worry!
You'll be safe!
KHYAN: Keep to the right!
Keep to the right!
Ramses!
Ohh!
Stop!
RAMSES: Stop! Stop!
DRIVERS: Whoa!
Go.
KHYAN: Keep moving!
Keep moving! Forward!
There.
Joshua!
Aaron!
Run!
Everyone, run!
Move!
JOSHUA: Run to shore!
Moshe.
Moshe.
We must leave!
Ramses!
Ramses!
DRIVERS: Whoa!
Go!
Ramses, stop!
All!
Turn around!
Turn around!
Khyan!
Leave.
Brother...
Leave now!
That's an order!
Come! You'll never
make it back!
Go!
Faster!
It's just me here.
Sit.
My family...
is not far from here.
Your family?
My other family.
My wife, my son.
I was thinking...
maybe I could convince them...
Convince them to join us,
but perhaps that's...
Perhaps that's not wise.
Of course they should come.
We have a long way to go.
A lot can happen.
And then...
we get there,
if we get there.
You don't think they'll
let us settle in Canaan?
They'll see us as invaders.
They won't have a choice.
We're as big as any tribe.
We're as big as
a nation of tribes
and that concerns me
even more.
Why?
This many people?
You have to ask?
But we all have
the same goal.
We do now.
What happens when
we stop running?
Ramses...
the Great.
Thank you.
Gershom.
Did you do what you said?
What did I say?
That you would
trade your faith...
to keep me.
No.
Good.
You may need it
more than ever now.
Who are they?
They're my people.
Who makes you happy?
You do.
What is the most important
thing in your life?
You are.
You are.
When will I leave you?
Never
May I proceed?
Proceed.
What do you think
of this?
I wouldn't do it...
if I didn't agree.
That's true.
I've noticed that
about you.
You don't always
agree with me.
Nor you me, I've noticed.
Yet here we are,
still speaking.
But not for much longer.
A leader can falter...
but stone...
will endure.
These laws will guide
them in your stead.
If you disagree...
you should put
down the hammer.
