History prefers
legends to men.
It prefers nobility
to brutality.
Soaring speeches
to quiet deeds.
History remembers the battle
and forgets the blood.
Whatever history
remembers of me,
if it remembers
anything at all,
it shall only be
a fraction of the truth.
For whatever else I am,
a husband, a lawyer,
I shall always think
of myself as a man
who struggled
against darkness.
I leave in your trusted
hands, my dear friend Henry,
this record that begins
when I was just a boy.
Get on down there.
Hurry it up!
Please, sir, no. There's
been some kind of mistake.
I ain't no slave.
Let them go! Aaron!
Go back inside!
Let them go!
Will!
Quiet!
He's my friend!
Look away, Abraham.
It's not our place.
Look away.
Abraham!
Thomas, help them!
Leave him alone!
Are you all right?
Did you strike
my friend here?
He was beating my son!
Did you strike him,
Lincoln?
They're not slaves,
and you know it.
I suggest you get
back to your work
before you find yourself
led away in chains.
Until every man is free, we
are all slaves.
Very well, then.
Since you're all so
concerned with freedom,
you may consider yourself free
from the burden of my employ.
And the debt you've
been working off,
I'd like it paid in
full with interest.
Now, please.
If you get one more penny
from me, Mr. Barts,
it will come with a fist
wrapped around it.
All right, Mr. Lincoln.
There are other ways
to collect a debt.
No!
What's happening
to her, Father?
Please help her!
Please, I beg of you.
You've got to do
something, Father.
Easy, child.
Look away, Abraham.
I've never seen
anything like this.
Strange.
You promise me.
Let's step outside.
I'm sorry, I don't
know what ails her.
Abraham.
Come and lie next to me.
I've been writing, Mama.
"Days are swift
as an Indian arrow,"
"flying like
a shooting star."
"The present day is here,"
"and then slides away
in haste,"
"that we can never say
is ours,"
"but only say"
"is passed."
Mother?
Mother?
Mama once told me that
I hadn't cried when I was born.
That I'd simply
opened my eyes,
looked at her smiling
face, and smiled back.
I don't know how he did it...
Abraham,
you promise me...
You promise me you won't go
and do anything foolish.
Nine years later, my
father joined her in death.
No longer bound
by my promise,
I tried to fortify the nerve
to pursue my vengeance.
Haven't you had enough?
A boy only gets this drunk
when he wants to kiss a girl
or kill a man.
Adam, Adam, let me explain.
Last one, Barts.
I'm not coming up here to clean
up your messes any more.
Yes, sir.
I promise.
Every so often, I think about what
it would be like to be in the South.
So, where's Henry?
Yes, sir. We've been
looking all over, sir.
Searching high and low.
Low is more likely.
Just find him, Barts.
Oh, and send
a fresh crop south.
We have a lot of
mouths to feed.
Yes, sir.
"Yes, sir, no, sir.
High, sir, low, sir."
For my mother.
That was unlucky.
Might have put me
out of my misery.
Where the hell
are you running to?
Don't much like
chasing chickens.
Little boy,
all grown up.
Come to avenge
his dear momma.
There are two kinds
of men, Mr. Lincoln.
Those that have the guts
to pull the trigger
and those who do not.
Powder, patch, ball.
Don't mess it up.
You weren't asleep
that night.
Were you?
Oh! You dropped the ball,
Mr. Lincoln.
Your mama's blood
was sickening sweet.
I hope yours
tastes better!
Might I suggest
that we begin by
closing the door?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I didn't see anything!
Should we dive right in?
Or are you finding Gabrielle's
egress too distracting?
I'm sorry, sir,
but who are you?
Who I am is
Henry Sturges.
And where you are
is my home.
And what happened...
I saved your life
during your rather pathetic
attempt at taking another's.
What were you
doing there, and
how did you know
I would try to kill Barts?
How?
I watched this boy carry out his
first long-awaited mission.
Drunk, might I add.
And I think, "You have wasted your
time watching this one, Henry."
"He's not
a promising recruit."
"He is just a selfish boy with
his heart set on vengeance."
And I realized, "This boy
is a goddamned idiot!"
"I doubt he even knew
his target was a vampire."
A vampire?
Yes. Immortal,
blood-sucking demons.
Fortunately for you,
Mr. Lincoln,
hunting them is
something of a hobby.
But vampires
are just myths.
Myths don't
beat you senseless
after you've put
a bullet in their brain.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Lincoln,
vampires are real.
They exist in every city
and every state
in the Union.
If what you say is true,
you could help me kill him.
I could pay you
to kill him!
My services
are not for sale.
And the word you are
looking for is "destroy."
It is quite a feat to kill
that which is already dead.
But you don't understand.
My mother was murdered.
And if I teach you how
to murder her murderer,
so what?
How will that
honor her memory?
How will that benefit the next
boy whose mother is taken?
If vengeance is
all you seek,
seek it elsewhere.
Teach me to fight as you do.
Please, I'll do anything you say.
You promise to cast aside
all notions of vengeance
and commit to
the life of a hunter?
You will have
no friends,
no family.
I told him
what he wanted to hear,
but all I cared about was killing
the monster that took my mother.
I'm in.
Scottish Highland pistol.
And if one barrel
isn't enough,
seven should do you.
The blunderbuss.
And if you lose
your ball,
you can always stuff your pocket
watch down the end of it.
So, Abe,
which one
takes your fancy?
Actually, I haven't had the best
of luck with shooting irons.
But,
I was a rail splitter.
I would like you to chop this
tree down with a single swing.
That tree?
It's got to be more than a foot across.
That's impossible.
But it isn't a tree.
It's what you hate
most in the world.
So, tell me,
Mr. Lincoln,
what do you hate?
I hate Jack Barts.
Then strike him down.
Well, clearly you don't
hate him that much.
Tell me what you hate.
I hate that my mother
was taken away.
Inadequate.
I hate that
we were afraid.
And?
That my mother and father,
everyone that we knew,
lived in fear.
Pathetic.
I hate that
I was too small.
Too weak.
Yes.
And that you failed...
Yes!
...to protect her.
Yes!
And that you
let her die.
Power, Lincoln,
real power,
comes not from hate,
but from truth.
Before you protect others
from darkness,
you must first be able
to protect yourself.
Your enemies have the power to
render themselves invisible.
You must have the ability
to fight blind.
To see, without seeing.
Again.
In the weeks
that followed,
Henry endeavored to impart a
lifetime of vampire-hunting secrets.
Their ability to
adapt to sunlight.
Their power to render
themselves invisible.
But most of all, he taught
me how to destroy them.
When Judas
betrayed Jesus,
his reward was
At that moment, those pieces
became a symbol of betraying God.
Of evil.
And silver
became a curse
You will never see a vampire
with silver on his person.
Nor see them
reflected in mirrors.
The one thing God placed
beyond the reach of a vampire.
The one thing he
can never possess.
Barts.
And the only thing
that renders him powerless.
Henry, Jack Barts!
I give you the targets.
That was our deal.
This is not only
about Jack Barts.
Vadoma,
a ruthless enforcer.
And her brother.
I've seen him before.
I saw him
with Jack Barts.
They call him Adam.
He, from whom
all others are made.
Vampires have been in the
New World for centuries.
Slaughtering native tribes
and early settlers.
But when the Europeans
arrived with their slaves,
the dead saw a
sinister opportunity.
They built an empire
in the South.
But, in recent years,
they pressed north,
leaving death
in their wake.
It falls to us, Abraham,
the hunters,
to keep the balance.
To ensure that this
remains a nation of men,
and not monsters.
What we do, we do
not for one man,
but for the good
of all mankind.
Henry sent me off into
the world with a reminder.
No attachments.
No distractions.
Besides,
who could I trust?
Anyone in this
well-mannered city
might very well
be one of them.
Son of a bitch!
I ever see you here again, I will
have your balls as a coin purse!
Good afternoon, sir. Joshua
Speed at your service.
Abraham. Uh, Lincoln.
I need a bit of help.
All right.
Well, a friend in need,
is a friend of Speed.
What can I get for you?
I don't suppose you know of any
rooms for rent, Mr. Speed?
What sort of room are you
looking for, Mr. Lincoln?
Well, a cheap one,
as I have spent all of
my money on law books
and have none to
spare at the moment.
Now, as you say
you have none,
am I to take your
meaning as "cheap"
or "free of charge"?
Well, on credit.
I don't think you'll find
such a room in Springfield.
People here are strangely
accustomed to being compensated.
Good day.
There is one room,
Mr. Lincoln.
I was recently forced to part ways
with a thieving prick of an associate
and am, therefore,
in need of a replacement.
There's a room upstairs.
It isn't much, but I suppose
it could be had on credit,
if the tenant were willing
to work here in return.
life in Springfield is
less than desirous.
My pittance of a salary doesn't allow
me to deviate from your rules.
And certainly, no woman would find
me, and my existence, enticing.
Excuse me.
Excuse me,
I'll be needing these.
Just one second, ma'am.
Well, you needn't call me ma'am,
as if I'm some haggard spinster.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Madam... I mean, miss.
I'm Abraham. Uh, Lincoln.
Mary Todd.
Darling.
There you are.
You mustn't flit from store
to store so quickly.
Well, perhaps if you didn't stop to jaw
with every gentleman in Springfield...
I could say
the same for you.
Stephen Douglas.
How do you do?
Abraham... Lincoln.
Are you a voting man, Mr. Lincoln?
I...
How do you feel about keeping
slavery out of Illinois?
I'm running for
the legislature.
I'm sure he'd love to hear
your campaign speech,
but Mr. Lincoln was just
about to attend to my list.
We were talking, dear.
Slavery, it's
a complicated issue.
I couldn't disagree with
you more, Mr. Douglas.
Mr. Douglas, Miss Todd.
You have met my new
associate, Abraham.
A letter came for you.
Your prescription awaits
you at the local pharmacy.
Ask for Aaron Stibel,
Junior.
Mr. Lincoln?
I'm so sorry.
Good day of work,
Abraham.
Thank you.
always have
a contingency plan.
Aaron Stibel, Junior?
Yes?
That's it.
Oh, that's tight.
Don't worry. It will only
hurt for a second or two.
Did you eat today?
But no amount of death
could make me forget.
Merciful Christ, Lincoln,
what happened to your face?
Don't worry, I'll still
be able to work.
Work?
To hell with work.
We got invited
to a ball.
It could be your chance to save
Mary Todd from a life of boredom.
This suit makes
me look ridiculous.
Nonsense.
But that hat makes you look ridiculous.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Look, there she is.
Mr. Douglas,
Joshua Speed.
Pleasure to see you.
Mary, you look lovely.
MAN 1: He's still missing.
MAN 2: Who's that?
Aaron Stibel.
Junior or Senior?
Junior.
MAN 2: Who is that man?
MAN 1: I don't know.
Mr. Douglas, you know
Senator Nolan, of course.
Oh, yes, Stephen.
Good to see you.
Have you heard this news?
Oh, yes. Yes, we're
looking into it.
Rest assured, this
kind of lawlessness
won't stand in the noble
state of Illinois.
It's called a dance.
If we were meant to sit alone, they
would've called it something else.
Yes, I suppose
they would have.
Come, Mr. Lincoln.
You'll ruin the upholstery
if you sit there any longer.
I'm sure you're a very
nice man, Mr. Lincoln,
but you're a...
A shopkeeper,
in a borrowed suit.
No, it's not a matter of means.
Really, no.
I came to Springfield looking
for someone different.
Someone whose life was a bit
more adventurous, and well...
My apologies,
I'm never this...
Honest?
Rude.
Miss Todd,
may I speak candidly?
I, too, came here
to better myself.
That's why I've taken
an interest in the law,
and why, if I may be so bold, I
have taken an interest in you.
And as for the adventure
that you seek,
I suspect that few men could ever
hope to provide that for you.
Least of all your fiancé,
Stephen Douglas.
Mr. Lincoln, you are
full of surprises.
Miss Todd,
you have no idea.
Be careful, it can
quickly disappear.
Henry, there are more
than I ever thought possible.
Pharmacists,
Innkeepers, pastors.
It's more than
a man can bear.
Well, I see I'm such
interesting company.
I'm sorry.
I've been working nights.
Really? Is that true?
Do you really want to
know the truth, Mary?
Each and every night,
I go out
hunting vampires.
Well, how do you
hunt these vampires?
With an ax.
A special silver ax,
of course.
Of course.
And how many would you
reckon you've killed?
Five. No, six.
I have killed
six vampires.
My goodness!
Abe!
Here I thought you were an honest man.
Really!
Well, I had
a wonderful day, Abe.
As did I, Mary.
Miss Todd, you are a woman of
ravishing resourcefulness.
Mr. Lincoln,
you have no idea.
You will have
no friends, no family.
I, uh, should be going. It's late.
How could I bring
her into this world?
A world of demons,
of danger
Good night, then, Lincoln.
Good night, Mary.
Happy hunting.
If I truly
cared for her,
the kindest thing
I could do
This hunter is another
of Henry's disciples?
They say
he's a madman.
I can't wait
to meet him.
A stock boy,
reading a law book.
What? You studying
to be a lawyer?
As a matter of fact, I am.
All right, what about
a little test?
What's the law for free
slaves in the North?
According to the Fugitive
Slave Act of 1793,
enforcing Article four,
section two,
of the United States
Constitution,
"All runaway slaves must be
returned to their owners."
However, personal
liberty laws state that
"Anyone who is
born free"
"cannot be taken
under this act."
I heard a good
woman once say
"Until all men
are free,"
"we're all slaves."
Will?
Will Johnson!
How did you...?
I was back home
and heard
you moved here.
Studying to be a lawyer.
That's good. I'm in
need of a good lawyer.
What, are you in
some kind of trouble?
I was freeing slaves down
South on the rail road,
hoping to find my
brother down there.
Some bounty hunters
got after me.
Said I was a runaway.
I need a writ, Abe,
saying I was born free.
You know, Will...
Come on.
Hey.
Speed, this is
Will Johnson.
Will Johnson, my oldest
friend in the world.
The store isn't
going to run itself, Abe.
I'll have him back as soon
as possible, Mr. Speed.
I promise.
You're getting tall, Abe.
Look like you still don't eat
much, either.
You still afraid
of the dark, too?
Not so much any more.
That's him, Abe.
That's the guy
that's been chasing me.
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
gentlemen,
I'm sure we can work this out.
Now I suggest
you walk away, son.
No, sir,
I suggest you do.
I've sent word
to Senator Nolan.
He'll have you out soon.
You're far too kind,
Miss Todd.
And he's far too ugly
to have a woman like you.
I think common-looking people
are the best in the world.
That's why the Lord
makes so many of them.
I just thank God
he was there.
But I won't
always be there.
Mary,
what if something was going
on, something terrible,
and you knew that there was no way
on earth that one man could stop it?
What would you do?
Well,
I wouldn't back away from what's
right just because it's hard.
My father used to say, "Plant
your feet and stand firm."
"The only question is
where to put your feet."
We may fail
in this fight.
We may only shatter the
tranquil veil of oppression,
but we must
not be deterred!
For ours is a just
and noble cause.
The cause of freedom.
The very cause upon which
our founding fathers built
this great nation!
A voice like that is too strong
to be stuck keeping shop.
I'm actually studying
to be a lawyer.
Ah! Well, Mr. Lincoln, maybe it's
time you thought about politics.
I can connect you
with the right people.
Thank you,
Senator Nolan.
A pleasure young man.
The same.
You're on your way,
Mr. Lincoln.
I sent you to Springfield
to hunt vampires,
not to chase votes.
Lesson one, always have
a contingency plan.
If vampire hunting
doesn't pan out,
I need a career
to fall back on.
I'm being serious.
So am I, Henry.
I have done everything
you've asked of me.
Every letter,
every name,
but never the letter
I wait for,
and never the name
I want most.
When do I get to
kill Jack Barts?
Barts knows about Mary.
It's time.
Abraham,
be careful.
Abraham-fucking-Linc...
Oh! Missed again!
I hope you're better with an
ax than you were with a gun.
Come on, Lincoln!
Catch me before
I get to Mary.
Catch me if you can, boy!
There's thousands
of us here.
He won't stop until this
whole country is ours.
And they'll be
coming for you now.
Ask your friend, Henry.
You shut your mouth,
you stupid whore.
Give me what I need, or
I'll knock your teeth out.
You lying son of a bitch.
God damn it!
No, Abe, stop!
You weren't
ready to know.
What, that you
are a vampire?
You are not
the only one
who has lost everything
to vampires.
Just because
the carriage stops,
doesn't mean
we have to.
Get in the carriage.
Take this.
Run. Just run.
Henry!
Her soul was pure.
But yours, Henry...
It's one of
God's little tricks.
Vampires cannot
kill their own kind.
Only the living
can kill the dead.
Welcome to the family.
You can't save the world,
and the ones you love, Lincoln.
You need to
make a choice.
I'm sorry,
but goodbye.
Abe!
Mary!
What on earth
are you doing?
Come on in.
What are you hiding?
Nothing.
Abe?
It's nothing.
Abe, I know
when you're lying.
What are you
hiding from me?
All right.
I didn't want to
tell you this way.
This is not the way
that I planned it.
But if you really
must know,
Mary Todd,
will you make me
the happiest of men?
And do you, Abraham,
promise to love her,
comfort her,
be honorable and honest
with her in all things,
in sickness
and health,
till death
do you part?
I do.
Then by the power vested
in me by almighty God,
in the great state
of Illinois,
I now pronounce you
man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Your mother
would be so proud.
Thank you, Will.
I'm happy
you could be here.
You're the only family
I have.
Except for this one.
Congratulations.
May I introduce
Mr. Henry Sturges.
My wife, Mary.
And my dear friend,
Will Johnson.
Heavens, Mr. Sturges, you're
as chilly as the winter wind.
Henry, please.
I'm afraid that's a hazard
of carrying one's own bottle.
Well, you know what they say,
"Cold hands, warm heart."
Yes, but I highly doubt that.
Mr. Sturges is
a business associate.
Yes, I thought we could
talk a little business.
Oh, of course.
If you'll excuse me.
What the hell
are you doing here?
Be cautious, Abraham.
One forgets how easily we can
lose the most precious things.
They don't even
know who I am.
Go upriver.
Invite this Mr. Lincoln to
join us at the plantation.
We're going to throw
a ball in his honor.
What makes you think
he'll accept?
I think we can find
a way to tempt him.
It's a good book.
It's good.
Get him!
Abe.
We've got a problem.
They took Will.
What are you
going to do?
I'm going to accept
his invitation.
Speed deserved to know the
truth of what we were about to face.
Not knowing if he would
believe me or think me mad.
Not knowing if he would have the
courage to face the monsters
You and me, Abraham, together
we can accomplish anything.
There are no slaves.
Where are they?
I was just
wondering that.
Something isn't right
about this, Abe.
Yeah.
I don't know
how to dance.
Don't worry,
I'll teach you.
Wait here.
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.
Bravo, Mr. Lincoln.
Bravo. You're even
better than I'd heard.
A shame to sacrifice
so many of my best men,
but I needed to know
if you're up to the task.
What do you
want with me?
To see you liberated.
To see you rise up
and destroy your oppressor.
That's interesting advice,
coming from a slave owner.
Men have enslaved
each other
since they invented gods
to forgive them for doing it.
I've seen Jews
build Egypt's glory.
thrown to lions
with my own eyes.
And I've seen Africans sell
their own kind to Europeans.
May I share one of the
revelations of my 5,000 years?
We're all slaves
to something.
I, to eternity.
You, to your convictions. Others,
to the color of their skin.
All I ever wanted
was to see my kind granted
their rightful place.
But there are those of us,
those like your friend Henry,
who enjoy
living in the dark.
And as you're
doubtless aware,
I cannot personally
destroy him, nor he I.
You, Mr. Lincoln,
you could eliminate those
last pockets of resistance,
beginning with
Henry Sturges himself.
All I ask
is for you to
break your chains.
Kill your master.
Be free.
And if I refuse?
Then you go on
your merry way.
After I make you
one of us, and
spoon-feed you
your friend.
Now, a simple "yes"
or "no" will suffice.
Kill Henry,
save your friend.
Feel free to take your
time to decide. Five,
four,
three,
two,
one.
Come on!
This way.
Miss Tubman, Miss Tubman.
We've been waiting for you.
Come quickly.
People getting
killed every day.
Slaves disappearing.
Some people talk about
monsters and demons.
Good morning.
Good morning.
How can I assist you
on this beautiful day?
We're looking
for three men.
You know, I did see someone
run down that way.
You're welcome to
come in if you like.
Our service is
about to begin.
Right,
let's keep going.
I take it y'all
came from up North?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, I suggest you get back
there as fast as you can.
There's a war coming.
A war for the soul
of the country.
Going to be all colors
of blood spilled.
Our nation was built
on the backs of slaves.
Their labor,
their blood.
More blood than you
could possibly imagine.
I have seen this horror
of the South firsthand.
I say the need for peace
outweighs the needs of the blacks.
I say that if the people of
this great nation want slavery,
then let them have it.
The demon of slavery is
tearing our country apart.
We must stand up. We must
stand strong and fight.
Fight for the very
soul of our nation.
Until every man is free,
we are all slaves!
You cannot take on
slavery, Abraham.
You cannot take
on the whole South!
Why, because of Adam?
No.
Are you afraid of him?
Because it is the only thing that has
kept them sated for all these years,
and you take that away,
then no one is safe.
So you get to choose
who lives and who dies.
A great man
once said,
"What we do, we do
not for ourselves,"
"not for one man, but for
the good of all mankind!"
Not all mankind, Abraham.
Abe?
May I have
my husband back?
He's all yours,
Mrs. Lincoln.
Henry only saw
the struggle his way.
But I began at last
to see it another.
To see and to feel the even
greater issues at stake.
So, he and I would
go our separate ways.
the time had come for me to
put aside childish things.
I would fight
not with an ax,
they proved
a stronger weapon.
Lincoln! Lincoln! Lincoln!
I appear before you
to take, in your presence,
the oath prescribed by the
Constitution of the United States
to be taken by
the president
before he enters on the
execution of this office.
The question of slavery is better
settled with a pen than with a sword.
Fire!
I found myself at
the father of a nation that
was tearing itself apart
while trying to be
the father to a boy
not much older than I was
when I lost my mother.
When's the last time
you had something to eat?
I'm not hungry,
thank you.
You have got to eat, Abe.
You're only human.
Come along, Willie.
Willie.
Willie.
If you do this, there is
no turning back, Abe.
I know.
I'm trying to protect
the freedom of a nation.
If this war is truly a
stand against evil,
then let it stand
for something.
If it is a war for
the freedom of man,
why not give all men
a reason to fight it?
"All persons
held as slaves"
"within any state or
designated part of a state,"
"the people whereof
shall be in rebellion:"
"against the United States
shall be then..."
"...and henceforward
shall be free."
Good morning.
Precious little one,
what's your name?
Willie.
And your father?
What's his?
Abraham.
What a beautiful
silver sword.
How is our
little soldier faring?
I've never seen
anything like it.
I'm sorry.
I don't know
what ails your boy.
Abe.
Mary's calling for you.
I'm so sorry, Abraham.
Why didn't they take me?
Because they know
it is a fate much
worse than death.
Mary
is inconsolable.
She says she doesn't want
to go on without him.
There is a way, Abraham.
You know that I can
restore the dead.
Do it.
Do it.
Mary...
Do it!
Your journal
the one you always
kept in your coat pocket,
I know I shouldn't have, Abe, but I
needed to know what you were hiding.
If what you say
is true,
I beg you,
give us our
little boy back.
Mary, he wouldn't
be our little boy.
He would be something else,
something terrible.
Trust me,
you don't want that.
You're asking me
to trust you?
After you lied to me
for all these years.
I did it to protect you,
to protect our family.
And how did that work out?
You did this, Abe!
You did this!
You brought this on him!
You brought this
on our boy!
Let me go to them.
Make a truce with Adam.
We must stop this war. Willie's
death is just the beginning.
Don't you dare
say his name.
I warned you.
You didn't heed me.
How many more boys will have to
die before you listen to me?
These boys
are dying in vain.
We should pull
the troops back.
Abraham, this war has
cost us countless lives,
not to mention
millions of dollars.
I thought we were going to
make this country great,
not tear it apart.
This is the only way we can
save the country now, Speed.
Send in troops.
Union troops are
flooding onto the field.
We are now
outnumbered
and ill-equipped
compared to the North.
We will support you,
but you will
need to support us.
No, thank you.
Rest assured,
Mr. Davis,
you'll have as many
of my kind as you need.
Fire!
Fire!
Ready!
Aim!
Here they come!
Fire!
Why did they
drop their rifles?
Fire!
It's the first day
of Gettysburg.
It's been a disaster.
I don't think the army
can survive another.
If the rebels break through,
they'll be here in days.
The generals think we
should evacuate Washington.
Run the war
from New York or
Boston, if need be.
You have to
win this war.
If you don't,
then all of it...
Then our son's death
will have been for nothing.
How can I win a war
when I can't even
protect my own family?
Our men have no way of defending
themselves against this enemy.
When our bullets are useless, our
bayonets are powerless as this fork!
This...
Will!
Speed!
This. This is
what we need.
A fork.
Silver.
Okay, okay.
How much do we need?
All of it.
And why tell
me this, Mr. Speed?
Why betray
your friend?
He is my friend, but I
love this country even more.
And he, more than anyone, is responsible
for tearing this nation apart.
You've done
the right thing.
I know.
That is a lot
of silver, Abe.
Now, how are we going
to get all this there?
I'm sorry, Mary.
I'm sorry I've kept you
in the dark all these years.
I need you, Mary.
I've waited a long time
to hear you say those words.
I want you to leave
Washington, Mary.
Miss Tubman,
please have some tea.
I very much appreciate you
coming to speak with me today.
Oh, yes.
Things have not been easy,
what with my...
The death of my
son and the war.
I need to get out
of Washington.
And I need
a lot of help.
This war ends tonight.
And With it,
our millennia
of darkness.
We have to do this
on our own.
No one can know
what's on that train.
If we don't get those weapons
to those boys at Gettysburg,
the war is over.
It's time we had
a nation of our own.
Come,
we have a train to catch.
It's 80 miles from
here to Gettysburg.
Eighty miles will decide whether
this nation belongs to the living
or the dead.
Is everything
all right, Speed?
I just can't believe you're
still writing in that book.
It's all in here, Speed.
The good with the bad.
What's this?
They're
fleeing the nest.
Leaving Washington
free for us.
Look at me.
I said look at me.
Leave her.
Don't want to
miss this train.
Let's go.
Henry, what the hell
are you doing here?
I just wanted to see how far
your foolishness would take you.
I don't have
time to argue!
I didn't come here
to argue with you.
I came here to tell you that your
dear friend Speed back there
is a traitor.
He betrayed you, Abe.
Speed is leading you...
You have no idea
what you're talking about.
That's all
according to plan.
You must
get off this train.
No, you must
get off this train.
This is not
your war, Henry.
Ah.
They're here, Abe.
A whole heap of them.
We can't let them
stop this train.
You go through there
and you're dead.
Get out now,
it's your last chance.
Did you load that thing?
We've got to keep them
away from the locomotive.
Why don't you let
him go, Lincoln?
Emancipate yourselves.
I will never follow you.
Oh, you don't have
to follow me, Abe.
I have the train.
I have the silver.
Soon I'll have
the whole country.
I'm going to destroy the
myth of Abraham Lincoln
so that history will forever
know you not as a man,
but as a monster!
Lincoln set us up.
We've been tricked, Adam.
There is no silver
on this train.
Abe!
Abe!
Abe!
Hello, Speed.
Where is the silver?
Silver?
Should be here.
Why did you lie to me?
To get you all
in one place,
to finish you.
Speed?
No!
Mr. President!
There is nowhere
left to run, Lincoln.
Where is it?
Where is the silver?
Right here!
Thank you, Henry.
I suppose some vampires
can be trusted.
As can some men, Abraham.
If the train
was a decoy,
where is the silver?
This isn't
the only rail road.
A wise man
once taught me,
always have
a contingency plan.
Get me more!
Bayonets. Bayonets for
Springfield muskets.
Springfield muskets!
Five-pounders and grenades are
in the second wagon in the back.
Go now, go now.
Fire!
Four score
and seven years ago,
our fathers brought forth
on this continent
a new nation
conceived in liberty
and dedicated to
the proposition
that all men
are created equal.
Now we are engaged
in a great civil war,
testing whether that
nation, or any nation
so conceived and
so dedicated,
It is for us,
the living, rather
to the unfinished work
which they who fought here
have thus far
so nobly advanced.
It is rather for us
to be here dedicated
to the great task
remaining before us
that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause
for which they gave the last
full measure of devotion,
that we here highly
resolve that these dead
shall not have
died in vain,
and that this nation,
under God,
shall have a new
birth of freedom,
and that government
of the people, by the
people, for the people,
shall not perish
from the earth.
Our enemies have
made their exodus.
some to South America
and the Orient.
They've seen that America shall
forever be a nation of living men,
We make rather
a good team, you and I.
One can't help but think of all the
good we could do if we had more time.
Limitless time.
Lincoln!
Yes, well,
time waits for no man.
We're going to be late
for the theater.
Hold onto this
for me, Henry.
Mary, darling,
have you seen my hat?
It's on your desk
in the office.
Have you seen my hat?
Abraham, let me
make you immortal.
Let us fight through the
ages, side by side.
Vampires are not the only
things that live forever.
History prefers
legends to men.
It prefers nobility
to brutality.
Soaring speeches
to quiet deeds.
History remembers
the battle
However history remembers
me, if it does at all,
it shall only remember
a fraction of the truth.
One more.
A guy only gets that drunk when he
wants to kiss a girl or kill a man.
So, which is it?
I watched you fall
apart and chased you to the end
I'm left with emptiness
that words cannot defend
You'll never know what I
became because of you
Ten thousand
promises
Ten thousand
ways to lose
And you
held it all
And I was
by your side
