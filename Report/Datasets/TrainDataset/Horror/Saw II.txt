Help!
Anyone?
Help!
Oh, fuck.
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?
Fuck! No!
No!
Someone help me!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, fuck!
Help me!
Help me! Please!
Fuck! What the fuck?
Please!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Excuse me.
Help you?
I'm here for
Daniel Matthews.
Sign these.
Thanks.
Let's go, Daniel.
Took you long enough.
I'm sorry I didn't
have it penciled in
on my schedule.
ERIC: They're gonna
press charges, you know.
Yeah. They're assholes.
Of course they are.
You stole from them.
This works out
great for me, though.
Your mother gets
to keep custody.
I get to take you
into custody.
What is it with you? Huh?
What, are you a tough guy
'cause you steal now?
Please, save me
the after-school special.
Why are you such
a cop 24/7?
Hey, it's called
being a father.
Trust me,
you're better at being a cop.
I just think
I should go back
to Mom's early.
What did you say?
What, can you not hear me?
No, I can't hear you.
Say it again.
I think I should
go back to Mom's...
Well, then, go!
Jesus.
ERIC:
Look, I haven't
heard from you.
Would you, uh, give
me a call, please?
Daniel.
Oh, sorry, Sarge.
I thought you were my son.
Yeah. I'll be right there.
What do you got?
County asbestos cleaners
were working on a deadline.
One of them finds a body,
calls it in.
Says that this
whole, uh, section's been
abandoned for two years.
We've spotted
people down here, though.
Who?
Well, homeless, mostly.
Bunch of kids held a rave
in the boiler room
about two months back.
Get an estimate on
the time of death?
Forensics just got here.
But it was
the arriving officer
who called it
in as your buddy.
He wasn't my buddy.
He was an informant.
This officer ID'ed him
just by looking at him?
Well, he wasn't positive.
That's why
I wanted you here.
All right.
Well, let me get
a look at his face.
I'll tell you
in two seconds
if it's him or not.
Therein lies the problem.
Yeah, it's Mike.
When were you gonna
tell me about that?
Thought you'd wanna
see it for yourself.
Okay. Well, I saw it.
All right, look.
I mean, it's a little early,
but so far
everything matches
Jigsaw's pattern.
I can see that.
What do you want with me?
All right, let's just
pretend for a second
that this is new
to us, all right?
Can you think of anyone
that would wanna
do this to your guy?
Well, he's
an informant, Kerry.
You want a list of
possible suspects?
Grab a phone book.
Crackhead county punks
don't have
engineering degrees.
Now, I'd say that
our cause of death here
narrows that list
down just a little bit,
wouldn't you?
Sure.
And you're the expert.
Look closer,
Detective Matthews.
At what?
Ask whoever wrote it.
You know, you and that guy
have a lot in common, Kerry.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
You both like
playing games with people.
Excuse me?
Don't ever pull some
shit like that again
on me at a crime scene.
Look, I'm not the one
taunting you. He is.
Doesn't mean I
have to take the bait.
Besides, I got
a full caseload as it is.
A bunch of desk errands
and shit work.
Yeah, well, between that,
IA breathing down my neck,
my son's budding
criminal career
and my wife's
fucking divorce lawyers,
I'd say my hands
are pretty full,
wouldn't you?
Yeah. Look, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I was hoping, maybe,
that I could bring
you in on this one.
We're not
partners anymore, Kerry.
Hey, forget that
we're not partners.
What about the fact
that this guy wrote
your fucking name
on the wall, huh?
He asked for you.
It's not the first
time some psychopath
called me out.
All right. What about
the fact that I'm asking?
Can't help you.
Wow.
You're the Jigsaw expert.
When did you stop
being a cop?
KERRY:
RIGG:
These are
the best entry points.
They're the ones with
direct street frontage,
vehicle access and good cover.
Now, remember,
we're doing this
in broad daylight.
We don't wanna
scare any civilians.
Let's just bust
in there and scare
the shit out of anyone
I'll go with Team Alpha.
Just like
the good old days, huh?
I thought your caseload
was big enough as it is.
I'm just tagging
along for the ride.
MAN 1: Go, go, go, go, go.
MAN 2: Check the back.
Secure the back.
MAN 3: Go around.
MAN 4: I got it, I got it.
KERRY: Alpha Team,
I want you in front.
Baker, flank the side.
All right, let's do this.
MAN 1: Go, go, go.
Keep moving, keep moving.
Freeze!
What the fuck?
Officer down! Officer down!
Officer down! Officer down!
Fuck this!
Baker Team, get in here now!
All right, go, go! Go!
Guys.
Talk to me, guys.
Go. Go.
Officer down. Okay.
Stand back.
Move him out. Move him out.
Clear. Clear.
Stand back.
Move out!
Repeat.
Freeze! Don't move!
Let me see your hands.
I'm not gonna ask again.
Put your hands
where I can see them.
Down on your knees!
Down on your knees!
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Get him in restraints now.
You have the right
to remain silent.
You have the right
to an attorney.
If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed
to you by the City.
He's clean.
Hey.
Is this close enough?
Get his ass out of here.
Actually, I will
need to remain here
while you deal
with your problem,
Detective Matthews.
What problem?
The problem in that room.
You keep him secure.
Clear.
Shit.
What?
I don't know.
Shit.
I think that's my son.
Fuck.
He's got my son.
What the fuck is that?
Hey! Hey!
What the fuck is that?
It's your son, Daniel.
You remember him, don't you?
I know who he is,
you piece of shit.
What is he doing on
that fucking monitor?
Well, I haven't
looked at the monitors
for some time,
so it would be
hard for me to say,
but I would imagine
that, um, he's cowering
in a corner
with a look on his face...
You motherfucker!
No, Eric. Wait.
You motherfucker!
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is he?
That's a problem you're
gonna have to solve
before it's too late.
He has about two hours
before the gas
creeping into
his nervous system
begins to break
down his body tissue
and he begins to bleed
from every orifice he has.
Oh, yes. There will be blood.
Tell me where he is.
He's in a safe place.
Eric.
I need a phone.
Eric, just listen
to me for a second.
Just give me a phone!
Look, everything about
this fits his profile.
I need to be sure.
JIGSAW:
I'm sorry.
We have something
counting down over here.
Get me bomb squad, now.
JONAS: Hey.
Hey, wake up.
Hey.
Can you hear me?
She's still breathing.
What is this, house arrest?
Are we in jail?
No.
This ain't jail, man.
Oh, yeah?
You done a lot of time?
Yeah. Too much.
Somebody open
the fucking door!
I don't think
anybody's listening.
Damn.
What the fuck is this?
Somebody's listening.
DANIEL: No.
Those types of cameras
don't have sound.
GUS: Fuck!
Fuck!
How do you just
wake up in a room
and have no idea
where you are?
I guess you never
been drunk before.
I've been drunk.
I spent three
years at college drunk.
This isn't drunk.
This is kidnapping.
Look, I, uh...
I saw this movie
on TV last week.
This guy, he was a reporter,
and he goes into
this war zone, right?
He goes in to
sleep in his hotel room
the first night.
Bam! He wakes up
the next morning,
he's in a cell with
no windows and no light.
And he spent
nine years in that room.
Nine years?
Man, that's nothing.
Get over it.
What do you mean,
"get over it"?
I mean, stop bitching
about it and let's
do something.
I think we should
all just calm down.
Shut up! Shut up!
I hear something.
What is it?
It's ticking.
I hear ticking.
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Hey, hey, hey.
Calm down. Calm down.
What's your name?
Amanda.
Where am I?
I don't know.
Nobody knows.
We all just woke up
here like you.
No!
No!
No!
No, it's okay.
No!
What?
Fuck!
What?
What are you
looking for?
What is this?
Everything you need
to know is on this.
JIGSAW:
Who is this?
What does he mean, gas?
JONAS: And how did you
know where to find this?
This is bullshit.
"Do not attempt
to use this key
on the door to this room."
Fuck this, man.
Yeah, fuck this.
That's a good idea.
No, no.
That's not a good idea.
So what are we
gonna do, huh?
Sit here?
The note said
not to use the key.
Who gives a shit
about the note, all right?
This is all
a fucking big goddamn joke,
and I'm about to end it.
You better start
talking right now.
What is this?
It's a game.
It ain't no fucking game!
My man just got
his head blown off.
He's testing us.
Who's testing us?
Jigsaw.
Who the hell is Jigsaw?
You don't watch
the fucking news?
JONAS: No. Who is he?
He's a serial killer.
No, he's not.
He's testing us.
He wants us to survive this.
But you have to play
by the fucking rules!
I'm gonna ask you again.
How do you know all this?
Because I've played before.
I want a tech
team in here now.
Find out where that
feed is coming from.
What do you want with me?
A little of your time,
Detective.
I don't have any time.
You asked me what I wanted,
and I told you.
Believe me when I tell you
your son is in
a lot of trouble.
And what if I give you
a little bit of my time?
What then?
I only wanna talk to you.
Everyone else must leave.
Those are my conditions.
No. It's a crime scene.
Nobody leaves.
They don't have to
leave the building.
They just have
to leave this area
long enough for
me to talk to you.
If you agree to that,
then you will
see your son again.
If I don't see my son again,
I swear to God
I'll rip your
fucking head off.
I don't intend to
mock you, Officer,
but I'm a cancer patient.
How could you possibly
put me in any more pain
than I'm already in?
Just get them here now.
All right,
tech team's on the way.
Should have your signal
traced within an hour,
maybe two.
He said he wants
to talk to me alone.
Well, maybe you
should talk to him.
Well, fuck that.
Five minutes,
old-school method.
KERRY: He's not gonna respond
to the phone-book treatment.
You know that.
RIGG: Don't underestimate
a tried and true method here.
I am the one who
has been working
on this case from day one.
I have been spending
every waking moment
piecing it together.
Maybe that's why
you ain't got a goddamn
family for yourself
and you can't understand
what this man
is going through.
Don't.
Look...
I don't wanna talk to him.
Listen,
you already lost your son
one time before
because you got
involved with me.
It's not gonna
happen again.
This is bullshit.
What are we gonna do?
Just humor him.
Buy us a little more time.
You can win this, Eric.
You can beat him.
Come on.
All right.
JIGSAW:
Shit.
Hey, wait a minute.
Where you going?
I'm gonna find an antidote,
and I'm gonna get out of here.
JONAS: What? Antidote?
You been in the joint.
You talked to the guards
that run the chambers.
You know there
ain't no antidote
for this shit.
Look at this.
The doors are locked.
You hear that? It's wood.
Plaster.
It's not a fortress.
It's a fucking house.
All I'm saying is
let's just take our time
and come up with a game plan.
Well, you come up
with the game plan.
All right?
I'm getting out of here.
Look.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I wouldn't do
that if I was you.
ADDISON: You don't
know what's behind
that fucking door.
Fuck.
Shit.
RIGG: Clear the room.
Okay. Let's talk.
Sit down, Eric.
I want to play a game.
The rules are simple.
All you have to do is
sit here and talk to me,
listen to me.
in a safe and secure state.
We haven't been
properly introduced.
My name's John.
I thought you liked
to be called Jigsaw.
No, no.
It was
the police and the press
who coined
the nickname Jigsaw.
I never encouraged
or claimed that.
The jigsaw piece
I cut from my subjects
was only ever
meant to be a symbol
that that subject
was missing something.
A vital piece of
the human puzzle.
The survival instinct.
This is all really,
really interesting, John,
but right now
I'd really like for
you to talk to me...
I am talking to you.
You're not listening.
Don't forget the rules.
I'm listening to you,
but all I'm hearing
is the same sick
fucking bullshit
that comes about
two seconds into every
interview I've ever done
with one of you
fucking people.
Well, that's
an interesting approach
to police work, isn't it?
Aren't you supposed
to be convincing me
that I'm your friend,
lulling me into
a false sense of security
so that I'll confide in you?
It's a little hard
to follow the manual
when you've got my son, John.
The manual?
What do you
really wanna do to me
right now, huh?
What would you have done
five years ago, huh?
Would you have
followed the manual then?
Would you have broken my jaw
with a flashlight?
You seem to know
a whole lot about me.
I know you were
once considered
a fearless police officer.
Do you feel a whole lot
safer now that you only
sit behind a desk?
I feel a whole lot
of things right now.
But you feel alive.
That's what you feel.
And that's the point.
Would you
kindly get me
a glass of water?
I would very much
appreciate that.
Fuck!
Well, we've established
that the macho-bullshit
approach isn't opening
the door.
Any other suggestions?
Look who's talking.
The only door you
know how to open
is between your legs.
Why don't you shut
the hell up, all right?
Come on, man.
Why don't you
shut the hell up?
I'm sick of your bullshit.
That's right,
back up, bitch!
You little dickhead.
Asshole!
JONAS: Hey!
What you gonna do?
Yeah, yeah, that's right,
back up!
Okay, man. All right.
Nobody take shit from nobody.
We've established that.
Did you find anything?
No. Nothing.
So, that ink on your arm,
that's Joliet, right?
Yeah. So?
Well, I did
a stretch there myself.
I'm proud of you.
And you,
what is your correctional
facility of choice?
What's your point?
JONAS: My point is,
you didn't get that way
by teaching
grade school, right?
That makes three of us
that's done time.
I think we should
be concentrating
on that tape,
'cause that tape said
we have more in
common than we know.
I say the three of us
doing stretches...
Hey! I found
a door over here.
XAVIER: I need the flashlight.
Over there.
What the fuck?
Oh, shit!
Hey!
Damn, kid.
Sorry.
"Obi."
What the fuck is a Obi?
Obi. It's my name.
JIGSAW:
Wait a minute.
What does that mean,
"kidnap the others"?
How would I know?
LAURA: Because
you put us here.
The car.
It was...
I knew I knew him.
You're the last person I saw
before I woke up here.
You did this.
JONAS: Are you sure it's him?
You better be sure.
I'm sure.
You would have done the same.
I did what I had to do.
I'll give you a choice.
You got five seconds
to get us out of here.
I don't know the way out.
Bullshit! You put us in here.
You can get us out of here.
No, I can't.
Then you're a dead man.
So are you.
He's not gonna...
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, listen to me.
Okay, we got two antidotes
at the back of that oven.
We're wasting time here.
Wasting time?
Are you kidding me?
He kidnapped me in
the middle of the night.
We don't even know
what's in those syringes.
You willing to stick
yourself in the arm
to find out?
DANIEL: Okay, wait.
So who gets them?
I mean, there's two.
So which two people
get the antidote?
We'll work that out later!
Right now
you're going in there
or I'll kill you
where you stand.
Shit.
If you're gonna
threaten me with a knife,
you may as well
cut me a little.
I guess I'm going in there
to get those needles.
But I get one.
Ah-ha.
One for me.
Hurry up.
Come on, baby.
You guys can
fight over this one.
Thank you, Obi.
Come on.
Oh, shit.
The fucking door closed!
Open the door!
Open the door!
It's locked.
I can't open it.
Open the door!
Open the fucking door!
Not funny!
Come on!
Get him out of there!
OBI: The door!
The nail!
I can't get it open!
Get him out of there!
OBI: Not funny!
Use your coat!
Use your fucking coat!
Come on! He's burning up!
Stop it!
Come on!
Turn! Turn!
Stop it.
You gotta put
your weight on it.
Stop it.
My man's dying!
Guys, there's
a window over here.
He's got the antidote.
Stop it!
Get him out. Ow!
Hurry!
Get it open.
Fuck!
...glass or something.
LAURA: Stop it!
Hang on, man.
We're gonna get you out.
Shit.
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Get out of the fucking way!
Go on, move! Move!
Here. Shit! Come on!
XAVIER: The needles!
He ain't got
the fucking needles!
It's fucking in there!
I want the fucking needles!
I want the fucking needles!
JONAS: Calm down.
Fuck!
JONAS: The needles
are fucking melted.
They're gone.
AMANDA: He had a choice.
RIGG: Another one
down, Kerry.
How much more time
are we gonna waste
on this bastard?
We're not wasting time.
We're doing exactly
what we should be doing
until the tech team
gets here.
It's not what it
looks like to me.
JIGSAW:
and survival of the fittest,
based on his little
trip to the Galapagos,
no longer applies
on this planet.
We have a human race
that doesn't have the edge
or the will to survive.
What the fuck do you want?
It's hard to
remain calm, isn't it,
when your son
is walking around
on those monitors?
I can't give you what
you want if you don't
tell me what the fuck it is.
I told you what it is.
Just remember the rules.
No, you said
you wanted to talk.
Then you said you
wanted to play a game.
You're talking,
but it means nothing!
What do you think
the cure for cancer is, Eric?
What?
The cure for cancer.
What is it?
I don't know what it is,
but I know
it's not killing
and torturing people
for your own sick
fucking pleasure.
I've never murdered
anyone in my life.
The decisions are up to them.
Yeah, well,
putting a gun
to someone's head
and forcing them
to pull the trigger
is still murder.
Since when is force
a problem for you?
Why are you so desperate
to get your son back?
'Cause he's my son.
What's the last
thing you said to him
before you left him?
Well, then, go!
Seems to me that
the knowledge of your
son's impending death
is causing you to act.
Forgive all his sins,
to wipe the slate clean...
Why is it that we're
only willing to do that
when a life is at stake?
I've always loved my son.
That's never changed.
No, no. It's changed now.
You see,
the knowledge of death
changes everything.
If I were to tell
you the exact date
and time of your own death,
it would shatter
your world completely.
I know.
John Kramer.
That the clock's
ticking for you.
You savor everything,
be it a glass of water
or a walk in the park.
The clock is ticking, John.
But most people
have the luxury
of not knowing
when that clock's
gonna go off,
and the irony of it is
that that keeps them from
really living their life.
It keeps them sleepwalking.
It keeps them
drinking that glass of water,
but never really tasting it.
You can still
fix this, John.
Yeah, but can we fix you?
Me?
I'm not fixable.
I've got cancer.
You're using
cancer as an excuse
for what you do?
No.
The cancer isn't
what started me
in my work.
It was the moment I
decided to end my life
that started me in my work
and brought meaning to it.
Fuck!
and I had failed.
yet I had lived through
a plunge off a cliff.
But, to my amazement,
I was alive.
Do you understand, Eric?
You got a chance
to do something.
Do it right now, John.
Just tell me
where my son is.
I'll help you.
I don't need your help,
and I can tell
you still don't understand.
Those who don't
appreciate life
do not deserve life.
My son appreciates
his life.
But do you appreciate yours?
Do you appreciate your son's?
Oh, this is shit!
Don't forget the rules
if you wanna
find your son.
Where are you?
No. No, we don't
have 15 minutes.
We need that location
to the video feed.
Hey. I don't think
we should stop, okay?
Laura, can you hear me?
That's the second time
I've had to wake up
in this shithole.
Think you can stand up?
Yeah, but I don't
really want to.
There's so much
left to do.
So many people
left to talk to.
This can't be it.
It's not.
Amanda, you said you
survived this, right?
I what?
This guy,
whoever's doing it,
you said that
you've played before
and you survived.
Yeah.
So that means
we could survive.
Yeah.
Wait. Amanda,
why did he pick you?
Because I was
a fucking junkie.
And the funny thing is,
I passed his little test.
If you passed his test,
then why are you back here?
How long have you, um...
I started in jail.
What were you
arrested for?
Possession.
But I thought
you said that...
Maybe you should talk
to the cop who arrested me.
I'm guessing
you've never been
arrested before.
No. Um...
I mean, I've been in trouble
a few times, you know,
in and out of stuff.
My dad's a...
He's, um...
He's a real hardass.
You know, he's
probably got half the city
right now looking for me
just so he can kick my ass
for disappearing on him.
Yeah.
Probably.
We found a door. Come on.
Come on.
We have to go.
It's the only
one without a lock,
but we can't get it open.
How's it going?
It's stuck
on something.
Oh, shit.
Here, let me try.
Move, move! Come on.
Will you take it easy?
Jesus!
Just back up, all right?
If it's stuck,
it's a trap.
Lady, this whole house
is a trap.
Obviously
someone didn't want us
to get into this room.
Now what?
I'm gonna be
right back, okay?
Whatever we do,
we got four minutes
to get it done.
JIGSAW:
DANIEL: Oh, my God.
Guys? Guys.
What?
Look.
Oh, my God.
Somebody's going in there.
Now, look,
somebody's fucking
going in there, man.
No! No! No!
Oh, shit.
JONAS: What the fuck
are you doing?
JONAS: What are you doing?
Stop.
No! No!
DANIEL: What the fuck
are you doing?
No! No! Please!
DANIEL: Let her go now.
No!
JONAS: Shit!
DANIEL: My God.
Come on!
We don't have time!
Oh, shit.
What the fuck's
wrong with you?
What are you doing?
You're out of
your fucking mind.
Hurry up.
Oh, shit!
Come on!
We don't have time.
Keep fucking looking.
Come on! Come on!
Fuck you!
What the fuck?
Somebody's gotta help her.
What the fuck, guys?
Fuck!
No. No. No. No.
No!
No. No!
Come on.
No, no, no.
You fucking bitch!
All right. That's enough.
That's not
nearly enough, man.
Stop this bullshit.
Did you hear that tape?
He knows about us.
Our names.
There's something
that we're not seeing.
Jail.
You said you
three had been there.
Make it four.
For what?
Doesn't matter.
Anybody else
wanna own up? Huh?
What about you?
You got juvie
written all over you.
No, never been.
All right.
Let's talk this out.
No.
No more talking.
The only thing you
people have in common
is holding me back.
I'm gone.
Where is this
goddamn tech team?
They'll be here
any second.
I'm not listening
to this anymore.
Another second is
too fucking long.
Look, I know how
this guy works, okay?
He's playing a game.
Eric just needs to stay in it
a little bit longer.
Take a look at the clock.
You need to start
thinking outside the box,
or his son is
gonna end up in one.
His work.
You wanna get to him,
that's how you do it.
I mean,
he's relishing this.
It's an opportunity
to be heard, to be studied.
Threaten to
destroy his work.
How will you get
your conviction
without all this
evidence, Eric?
I don't need this
shit to convict you.
So go ahead. Destroy it.
I will.
Destroy it all.
Just know it will
not save your son
if you do.
You kill my son,
I kill you.
Go ahead.
Why wait? We both know
the sort of person
you are, sir.
Get out of here.
The sort of person
who guns down
an unarmed suspect.
In fact,
the sort of person
who plants evidence
in order to
obtain a conviction.
The sort of person
whose wife leaves him
and whose son hates him.
Shut the fuck up!
Okay, set up all
the traces to the satellite.
Let's go.
Ah. Your tech
team's arrived.
Just in time.
You better hope
they find the source
of that feed.
There's something
I haven't told you, Eric.
I'm done listening to you.
Maybe I can just
show it to you.
But, unfortunately,
it's going to be difficult
for me to get it myself,
so perhaps you
could ask the people
who are listening on
that walkie in there
if they could get
it for me, all right?
Brown desk.
You may not remember
all those people,
JIGSAW:
Son of a bitch.
What are you doing?
I haven't decided yet.
You know, the others,
they're scared of you.
Good.
You and me,
we can keep
going at each other
like we're back in the yard,
or we can come together
and figure out
who's doing this to us.
You and the others
can do what you want.
I already found
what I'm looking for.
You remind me of me.
No matter what kind
of fucked-up situation
you're in,
you always gotta
find yourself an enemy.
You know what?
I got enemies, man.
Outside these
fucking walls, bro.
And they're looking for me.
And if they don't find me,
they're going after
the ones closest to me.
My family.
You understand?
No.
I don't understand.
It's just me,
and that's the way
I like it.
Now, turn around.
What?
Turn around.
Oh, shit.
No. We can't stop.
Shit.
Oh, my God.
We've been here
for two hours.
If what that
tape says is true,
then in one hour,
the front door will open.
We're not gonna
make it that long.
That's a real
winning attitude.
She knows what
she's talking about.
Oh, yeah?
"X" marks the spot.
What?
"X" marks...
Marks the spot.
There's the answer.
What are you
doing with him?
This is your father?
What? You know him?
Yeah.
He's the guy
who put me away.
He set me up.
Tell me that's
not your father.
It's okay. It's okay.
I can't trust any of you.
You two are
on your own.
Now we know what
we have in common.
Amanda, please.
I didn't know.
XAVIER: Hey, kid! Amanda!
Where are you?
Please don't leave me.
We gotta move.
Hey, kid!
Amanda!
I found a way out.
Eight.
Hey, kid!
Do not run.
Eric. Eric.
No! Stop!
Get off of me!
We tried it your way.
You motherfucker!
Where is he?
Eric.
Damn it.
Not long to go now
until your son
is pissing blood.
Now, that's the Eric Matthews
they gave medals to.
Help!
Help me!
Oh, my God.
Jonas.
Help me! Help me!
Help!
Please.
It's okay.
Help me.
It's okay.
No. No.
No!
Fucker!
No!
Amanda.
Nobody's listening
anymore, asshole.
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth!
Come on.
There you go.
You gonna tell me
where he is now, huh?
What?
Say it again.
Game... Game over.
I'll take you
to the house.
You're gonna
take me right now.
Right now.
I will only take you.
No one else.
All right.
Just me and you.
How do we get out of here?
There's a button
on the wall.
You'd better hurry.
There's not
much time left.
The elevator!
Come on!
Fuck!
Secure the warehouse now!
All right, let's go!
Go! Go, go, go!
Damn it.
We've got a lock.
This is Kerry.
They're both gone.
If I don't find my son,
I swear to God...
RIGG:
Yes! Kerry. We got a lock.
We got a lock on the house.
Rigg, we got it.
What?
237 North Hyde Crescent.
Got it.
Where to now?
Straight ahead.
Come on, come on.
Where are you?
Make a right on Alfred.
Open the fucking door!
Open the door!
There's nowhere to go.
All I want is the number
on the back of your head.
There's nowhere to go!
Come on, Amanda!
I can't hold it.
Come on! Let me in!
Let me in!
Open the door! Come on!
What do we do?
Take a left at
the next street.
It's the last
house on the left.
Oh, shit.
Shit!
XAVIER: Come on!
Come on, Amanda!
Amanda, what is it?
It's a door.
It's a fucking door.
You have nowhere to go!
You have nowhere to go!
XAVIER: Come on!
Help me move this thing.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Come on, Amanda!
Shit, it's locked!
Let me in!
Come on, open the door!
Come on!
The key.
The one we found
with the tape recorder.
Where is it? Where is it?
Fuck!
Jonas. Jonas had it last.
Come on, Amanda!
Find it! Hurry!
Come on!
Come on, open the door!
Let me in!
Eric, you're gonna need
this key when you
get inside the house.
DANIEL: Where the hell are we?
Run! Run!
Daniel?
Daniel!
Daniel, we gotta go!
We gotta go! Come on!
Run.
All right, come on.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Go, go, go!
Hallway's clear.
We're in.
Daniel!
The ground floor is secure.
Moving up. Moving up.
RIGG:
Cannot see you, Sergeant.
Repeat, cannot see you.
Repeat. I cannot see you.
What is your 20?
JIGSAW:
LAWRENCE:
LAWRENCE:
Daniel!
Daniel, no.
Don't leave me.
Please.
He's gone.
Doesn't matter.
All I want is the number
on the back of his neck.
And then yours.
You still don't
know your own number.
How are you gonna get
it if I don't tell you?
Daniel!
Shit.
Run!
Fuck.
Daniel?
I still cannot
see you, Sergeant.
Rigg, do you copy?
Left side clear.
Right side clear.
All clear.
KERRY:
It's not live.
Kerry, we're in
the wrong fucking house!
KERRY:
Let's go.
Daniel?
Daniel?
Daniel?
Daniel.
Daniel.
AMANDA:
You said you
survived this, right?
Yeah.
You must meet death
in order to be reborn.
He helped me.
Those who don't
appreciate life
do not deserve life.
Daniel!
He asked for you.
What the fuck do you want?
I told you.
He wants us to survive this.
I want to play a game.
You have to play
by the fucking rules!
The rules are simple.
All you have to do is
sit here and talk to me.
What?
If you can do
that long enough,
you will find your son
in a safe and secure state.
What the fuck is that?
It's your son, Daniel.
You remember him, don't you?
My dad's a...
He's a real hardass.
Why is that we're
only willing to do that
when a life is at stake?
Daniel!
I'm done listening to you.
Don't forget the rules.
Shut the fuck up!
He's playing a game.
I don't wanna talk to him.
You're not saying shit.
We both know
the sort of person you are.
Not long to go now
until your son is pissing...
I'll take you
to the house.
Daniel?
There's something
I haven't told you, Eric.
Daniel!
So go ahead. Destroy it.
Daniel!
You fucking bitch.
Game over.
I'll fucking kill you!
You fucking bitch!
You fucking bitch!
I'll fucking kill you!
No!
No!
