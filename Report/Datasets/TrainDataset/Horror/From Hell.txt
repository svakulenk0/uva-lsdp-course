MAN: Get out of here!
WOMAN:
You're taking all our money again.
That's better.
WOMAN: You'll feel better
when you get home.
KATE: There's one over there.
POLLY: Gonna be a long night, Mary.
MARY: Too bloody long.
ANNIE: It's quiet, isn't it?
You having any luck?
MARY: Not much, love.
MAN: Give you a penny for a suck.
MARY: Piss off.
LIZ: Hi. Where's Kate?
MARY: Across the street.
GEORDIE: Miss?
-What do you want?
-Shut your hole, bitch.
I know you.
You're Geordie, from Nichol Street.
Do you remember me, Mary Kelly?
I'd never forget you, McQueen.
Will you stop that?
Buttons are hard to come by.
What does a whore need buttons for?
I warned you and your friends.
Payment was expected Monday.
MARY: I'm working, ain't I?
We all are.
And I am making sure
that no one troubles you.
I'm providing a service, Mary Kelly.
And I expect to be paid...
...or else you will be very troubled.
Now, you tell...
...your five...
...friends they bring me my money
by tomorrow...
...or this friend of mine here...
...will be your next customer.
-You're bloody filthy this morning.
-I bleedin' stink.
-What'd you get up to last night?
-You don't want to know.
Give us a look.
ANN: Mary.
Thank God I found you.
He's coming.
Albert's coming today.
I need you to look after the baby.
Let's have a hold.
ANN: I'm so proud of her.
MARY: She's the most gorgeous little girl.
MARTHA: Isn't she beautiful?
ANN: She's lovely, isn't she?
I'll be seeing you in a bit.
Get us a jar of gin, will you?
You look fine, Ann.
Must be nice,
having a rich man looking after you.
She has your eyes and her father's brow.
Don't you think?
She is a perfect love, but, Ann,
we're all in a terrible way for money.
-The Nichols gang...
-They want our blood.
-Know what they said they'd do?
-Don't start.
What's she saying?
They want £1 a week from each of us.
Count yourself lucky.
Good and lucky that you got
a wealthy man to take care of you.
We need £4 to pay them,
so we can't spare the time.
I'll get you the £4 from Albert.
He might say no. I can't take a chance.
He won't. I know he won't.
He's been in France on business.
He wrote, he sold a lot of his paintings.
He's sure to have full pockets
and feel generous.
MARY: To you perhaps, but...
ANN: I'll ask for meself.
I'll get you the £4. I promise.
I'm not gonna hurt you, Netley.
Remember me?
Remember who I am?
Your charge will be coming down
sooner than expected. Much sooner.
Be a good man. Get him home quickly.
Quickly and quietly.
Understood?
Well said.
Very well said.
Take them out.
What is the meaning of this?
Kidney, what in God's name are you doing?
I want this room in pieces.
ALBERT: I demand an explanation.
It's Albert.
ANN: Get off me.
ANN: Please. No!
Who knows?
I didn't know.
I swear, I didn't.
How can I tell anyone else?
Who knows?
Who knows?
I don't know who they could be.
Albert must've mixed in
with something terrible.
She's hungry and cold, poor thing.
I've got to take her to them.
I've got to take her to Ann's parents.
You go. Leave baby Alice with them.
I'll get to work,
and I'll meet you later at the Ten Bells.
CORONER: Notice something, Inspector?
I pay. I already pay.
I'm not after you, Emperor. Where is he?
Move it!
Get up.
Get up!
Hello, darling.
Sergeant.
It's night.
Well spotted, Inspector Abberline.
Indeed it is night.
Our genius has returned to us.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Remember, if you ever wish to escape
the dreary confines of your duties...
...this never happened.
Cut along now.
Have I lost a day?
No. It's only four hours since you left here.
Deepest apologies for the rude awakening.
I suspect you enjoyed that.
"I must be cruel only to be kind,"
as the poet said.
Although, I'd happily wallop you
every time you chase the dragon.
I had a sneaking suspicion
you might interrupt.
You've seen something?
What did you see?
A petticoat saturated with blood.
They used to burn men like you alive.
Sometime this evening,
a bangtail was murdered in George Yard.
That doesn't sound
much out of the ordinary.
It was the way she was done.
It was the way the bangtail was done
that cries out for a man of your talents.
POLICE SURGEON:
Her name was Martha Tabram.
I don't know what sort of name Tabram is.
It sounds foreign to me.
This is not what I saw.
Not the woman of your dreams?
Are you sure?
-Show him.
-You show him.
Why do I have to be exposed
to this degradation over and over again?
I've looked at the mess twice.
Before he cut her throat,
he removed her livelihood as a keepsake.
SIR WILLIAM: Gentlemen,
we are indeed fortunate today...
...to be able to observe an entirely new
approach to the treatment of insanity.
Dr. Ferral, I was just saying
to my colleagues...
...we're here in the hope you'll permit us
to observe this new treatment of yours.
I wasn't expecting
such distinguished visitors.
But you're all welcome, of course.
I'm ready to begin.
SIR WILLIAM: Who is your patient?
FERRAL: Ann Crook.
An unfortunate, Sir William,
who is hysterical and violent.
And has severe delusions of persecution.
Poor girl. Do please proceed.
Gentlemen.
We have one tap above...
...and one into the left lobe.
And...
...one on the right...
...and this unlucky patient's dementia...
...will no longer take a violent form.
Thanks to this simple procedure...
...we can now permanently alleviate
the poor girl's suffering.
MARY: What could I do?
I had to leave the baby with Ann's parents.
Rich man?
Thought he was gonna take care of her?
Knew that was too good to be true.
KATE: They're gonna kill every one of us.
Who is this Albert anyway?
Who cares about Albert
and Ann's troubles?
What are we gonna do?
We can't stay clear
of the Nichols boys forever.
They say that they held
poor Martha down...
...and watched her bleed
until she passed out.
Then they cut her throat.
McQueen is mad.
He enjoys hurting women.
POLLY: It's insane that they want £4.
How are we gonna get £4?
Not with my old cunny.
I'd be lucky to get four pence.
BARTENDER: Behave yourselves
or bugger off.
LIZ: You can bugger off.
KATE: We work, girls.
We work the streets harder than ever.
Right?
Right?
POLLY: All right.
We can do it here, but hurry up.
POLLY: The bobbies are tracking us.
MAN: Right.
Gotta get the old man hard first.
POLLY: Give it here. I'll put it in meself.
-ls that in?
-Of course it is. Come on.
It's not.
You got it stuck between your legs.
POLLY: No, I haven't. Come on.
MAN: I knows it when I feels it.
That's mine, Polly.
That's my money.
I could pop your eye out.
The customers wouldn't mind.
They don't mind if a whore can see.
OFFICER: What's that you got?
McQUEEN: What've I got?
What have I got here, Constable?
Only a little thing.
Only a little thing to you,
but a great thing to me.
OFFICER: Move!
Or I'll bash that smart mouth.
You're a dead woman.
LIZ: Lovey,
he won't bother you again tonight.
ANNIE: That's right. Look.
One for the Nichols, and one for me.
LIZ: Come here.
We'll work the streets together.
I'll keep my eye on you, love.
You pig!
You disgusting pig!
Yeah, I'm a pig.
I'm what's wrong with the world.
Be on your own then.
POLLY: No!
LIZ: You don't want the company of a pig!
What the fuck are you looking at?
THE RIPPER: Thirsty?
POLLY: Yes.
That was the thing that was in my dream.
POLLY: What's it called again?
THE RIPPER: Cleopatra's needle.
Cleopatra. She was a beauty, wasn't she?
THE RIPPER: It was carved 1,500 years
before the Son of God was born.
Six men died to bring it here...
...from Egypt.
OFFICER: May the good Lord have mercy.
OLD MAN: She was like that
when I found her. All murdered.
WOMAN: What kind of monster did this?
GODLEY: The boys have made rounds
of the taverns...
...and the delightful domiciles
that make up this charming street.
Will it surprise you
that no one heard a sound?
Her throat was cut,
but there's no arterial spray on the wall.
She was killed somewhere else.
It rained last night, didn't it?
She's dry.
She was brought here
in a carriage or something.
Her throat must've been cut
in the carriage.
I imagine they stopped it over there.
They?
There's more than one?
Most definitely.
This was all in your vision?
GODLEY: Jesus!
So, definitely more than one person.
It has to be a message
from the Nichols boys. Right?
What the hell?
That's grapes, isn't it?
What the hell would a bangtail
be doing with grapes?
I'd like to give them an answer.
-What?
-The Nichols boys.
I'd welcome the opportunity to give
them an answer to their bloody message.
There is most definitely a message here.
You're right about that.
What am I wrong about?
Martha Tabram was raped,
tortured and killed.
That's cruel.
But I've seen that sort of cruelty
in the East End before.
This is methodical.
The butchery is irrational, yet...
...meticulous and deliberate.
Altogether a different breed of killer.
As soon as possible,
I'd like to know what he took.
What do you mean "what he took"?
-Didn't you notice?
-What?
He's taken at least one of her organs.
Oh, no.
I want every veterinarian...
...butcher, furrier in the district
interviewed.
Furrier? What did he do, sir? Skin her?
Pipe down, Withers.
When the Inspector is talking
you are listening, understand?
Yes, Sergeant.
He disemboweled her.
After he cut her throat,
stabbed her in the chest...
...cut open her stomach,
and took out her intestines.
At least one of her organs was removed.
I'm waiting for the police surgeon's report
for more details.
SIR CHARLES: I see.
One thing's for certain,
an Englishman didn't do it.
Maybe one of these Red Indians...
...wandered into Whitechapel
and indulged his natural inclinations.
With all due respect, sir...
...I believe this was done by someone with
at least a working knowledge of dissection.
-An educated man, such as a doctor...
-An educated man? That's preposterous.
No well-bred man would do this.
Probably a tradesman or a butcher.
A tradesman is a possibility, sir.
But there's a strong indication against it.
There was a sprig of grapes
under her body.
What are you driving at?
No one in Whitechapel, no matter
what their trade, could afford grapes.
Obviously,
they were given to her by the killer.
It follows that he must be
someone with money.
What about the Jews? A Jew butcher?
Or a Jew tailor might have money.
Plenty of them in Whitechapel.
Sir, for the sake of public safety
in general...
...l'd like to be careful about spreading
the rumor it might be a Jew.
I know your reputation for making guesses
that turn out to be right.
Someone told me
you claim to dream the answers.
Frankly, it doesn't matter to me
what your methods are.
But be certain you don't proceed
without proof. Is that clear?
Of course, sir.
Personally, I don't care. The fewer
pinch-pricks on the streets, the better.
But the sooner you find this butcher
or tailor...
...the sooner we can all celebrate
your promotion.
Keep me informed.
MAN #1: Every cellar, every stable.
We'll find him.
MAN #2: It's the bleeding Jews.
Let's kill them!
VICTORIA: I have wonderful news.
FREDERICK: Tell me.
Surely you, of all people, can guess.
FREDERICK:
I don't want to guess with you.
Dr. Marbury says...
Dr. Marbury says?
Dr. Marbury says
I'm going to have your child.
GODLEY: "Ay, to die
"and go we know not where
"To lie in cold obstruction and to rot"
A simple "rest in peace" would suffice.
GODLEY: Yes, sir.
"In the midst of life we are in death...
"...of whom may we seek for succor
but of Thee, O Lord...
"...who for our sins art justly displeased?
"Yet, O Lord God most holy...
"...O Lord most mighty... "
FREDERICK: Good afternoon, ladies.
I'm Inspector Abberline.
This is Sgt. Godley.
We're investigating the murders
of Polly Nichols and Martha Tabram.
We understand they were both friends
of you ladies.
Close friends.
We're hoping you'd be able to help us.
LIZ: Don't know nothing.
ANNIE: Me neither.
Why are you bothering us?
You ought to bother McQueen.
-ls he the boss of Nichol Street?
-The heart and soul of the gang.
Isn't it your job to be knowing
that small detail?
What makes you think McQueen did this?
Can't prove nothing by me.
-You're Mary Kelly, right?
-That's right.
FREDERICK: Unless one of you
is willing to testify against McQueen...
...I can't do nothing.
Surely, Inspector...
...a strong, handsome man like you...
...could do anything
you put your brilliant mind to.
I'm a coward and a weakling.
I can't help meself.
What's your excuse?
Why are you so bloody useless?
KATE: Come on, Mary. They won't help us.
Is that you?
Before my mother died, back in Ireland.
-ls that when you came here?
-Yeah.
-When I was 8.
-When things was good.
MARY: We were starving,
but we were starving in fresh air.
I was thinking...
...we ain't never gonna earn enough
to satisfy the Nichols boys...
...and feed our own mouths.
You said those men...
...who took the rich artist man
and her as well...
You said they was clean-shaven,
and their clothes was neat.
MARY: Right.
ANNIE: They weren't criminals, then.
They weren't the Nichols boys.
They was unusual.
Perhaps even official.
What are you getting at?
Maybe we could go with the papers,
get paid for the story.
ANNIE: "Where's Ann Crook?"
The papers are always desperate
for things bad about the government.
It's a mystery, to boot.
Not a bad plan. What do you think, Mary?
We should talk to that inspector,
the one at Polly's funeral.
Fuck me! No.
If we go to the papers, they might hurt Ann
even worse. Or hurt the baby.
Worse than what'll happen to her
in Whitechapel when she sprouts teats?
MARY: I don't know for sure.
But I think we're better off
talking to that inspector.
Lord, you are young after all.
Four bitches.
That's what I thought.
You only paid for one person.
MARY: They're my guests.
LANDLORD: Guests?
Let me welcome your guests.
Go on! Get out!
Get out of here, you bloody whores.
When you have four pence...
...you can come back
with your ladies in waiting, Your Grace.
LIZ: Shut up.
ANNIE: Back to work then.
Let's try and stay together.
-We can't. You know that.
-Then stay good and clear of Nichol Street.
Come on.
LIZ: All right, Annie?
ANNIE: Bloody bastard.
LIZ: How's your head?
ANNIE: Very funny.
NETLEY: Boo!
NETLEY: I didn't frighten you, did I?
I've been looking for you.
Been looking all over for you.
You've been looking for me?
Not for me. On behalf of my gentleman.
A very fine gentleman.
He sent me to find you.
Your gentleman sent you to find me?
Get off! I might be unfortunate,
but I'm not a blithering idiot.
It's the truth! The God's truth.
He's seen you. He likes you.
He said, tonight, only you'll do.
He said to find you, take you to
Hanover Street where he's waiting for you.
You're very pretty.
NETLEY: Go on. Get in, I'll take you there.
I almost forgot.
My gentleman got you a present.
-You like grapes?
-Yeah.
Your gentleman, he must be very refined.
ANNIE: Very refined indeed.
NETLEY: Get in.
-I'll take you there.
-All right.
NETLEY: Here we are.
ANNIE: I'm a lucky lady.
NETLEY: You are, lady.
ANNIE: Your gaffer,
does he want anything special?
NETLEY: Just the usual, I expect.
This alley takes you to the yard.
My gentleman is quiet.
He doesn't like disturbances.
What I want to know is, a toff like him...
...how much is he offering?
NETLEY: Here, £2 for now.
That'll do me.
Let me see you.
ANNIE: Down there?
NETLEY: Straight to the door at the end.
ANNIE: Straight down there, right?
POLICEMAN: You watch your mouth!
BEST: Any more information?
My readers want to know.
Is it true you found a piece
of leather apron in her mouth?
No. But if it's your fancy, I'd be delighted
to stuff your mouth with leather.
BEST: Give us a tidbit, Sergeant.
We'll put your picture on the front page.
WOMAN: Do something about this.
This is ridiculous.
MAN: There's a bloody murderer
on the loose. What about my wife?
This is Annie.
GODLEY: Yes.
Another of the circle of friends.
Annie Chapman.
Dark Annie, they called her.
You still say this isn't the Nichols boys?
Did the constable show you the bit
of leather found by the waterspout?
Could be part of a butcher's apron.
Leather apron. Dear God,
we could be looking for a butcher after all.
I saw her.
-This one?
-Yeah, last night.
I saw her face.
POLICEMAN: Don't trample over this area.
WOMAN: Let us see the body!
WOMAN: Come on, let us see.
GODLEY: Oh, God.
There's your typical Londoner...
...imbued with the Christian spirit
of sympathy for his fellow man.
Or fellow whore, in this case.
He's really outdone himself this time.
He not only severed the intestines...
...he's carefully arranged them
around the neck and shoulders.
I think he's taken more organs this time.
Grapes again. Why grapes?
Only Polly and Dark Annie
were given grapes.
Only they were disemboweled
in such a meticulous fashion.
This ain't killing for profit.
This is ritual.
Yeah, but why grapes?
So they'll trust whatever he offers.
I've never fully understood that tradition.
They're for the ferryman.
The ferryman who takes the body
across the river into the land of the dead.
If she don't have the money to pay him...
...she'd have to wander,
forever lost between the two worlds.
I need to consult a doctor.
Are you ill, Inspector?
A surgeon, to be specific.
The killer removed
the victim's uterus and its attachments.
My God. He's out of his mind.
That's very astute of you, sir.
I don't appreciate sarcasm, Inspector.
FREDERICK: I'm sorry, sir.
I meant nothing by it.
You already have a surgeon
at your disposal.
I need a man with a strong stomach
and a sober mind.
The police surgeon has neither.
SIR CHARLES: No. Request denied.
FREDERICK: Why?
Are you questioning my decision?
No, sir. I simply want to know why.
There's already too much nonsense
and gossip in the press.
You start consulting doctors, and
all sorts of wild notions will be printed.
No one else is to see the bodies.
DOCTOR #1: It is my honor...
...to present this unique
medical phenomenon.
Until last week, Mr. Joseph Merrick...
DOCTOR #2: John Merrick.
I beg your pardon.
Mr. John Merrick was an attraction
at a side show.
Now he's being cared for
at England's leading hospital.
With your generosity,
we will be able to continue to do so.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...Mr. John Merrick.
DOCTOR #1: Turn around.
WOMAN: It should've been killed at birth.
DOCTOR: Good health!
ATTENDANT: That will be the last one,
Your Royal Highness.
FERRAL: ...a psychotic patient.
Pardon me, sir. Are you Dr. Ferral?
I am.
I'm Inspector Abberline,
assigned to Whitechapel.
Oh, my Lord! You're the Ripper case.
-Am I right?
-Yeah.
Jolly good.
You've come to the perfect place.
We've got butchers aplenty here.
I see.
I could certainly use your expertise
to help solve this case.
They tell me you're
the best young surgeon in London.
FERRAL: Really?
I don't see how a reputable surgeon
could know anything about it.
This country's overrun
with foreigners, Orientals.
Jews.
Socialists trying to stir things up
against our monarchy.
That's who you should be pursuing,
don't you think?
Excuse me.
You don't belong here, do you?
SIR WILLIAM: I'm afraid Dr. Ferral suffers
from the surgeon's malady.
FREDERICK: What's that, sir?
Want of feeling.
He knows everything about anatomy
and nothing about the soul.
How may I assist you, Inspector?
Forgive my ignorance, but...
...are you a surgeon?
I was.
Unfortunately,
I suffered a brain seizure six months ago.
-I'm sorry to hear that, sir.
-These days, I limit myself to teaching.
So you see, I'm accustomed to
answering questions, Inspector.
FREDERICK: Could you tell me
what sort of a knife this would be?
I think you mean to draw a Liston knife.
It's named for Liston,
who was a surgeon in the Crimean War.
Because there was
no anesthetic on the battlefield...
...he had to carry out
his amputations very quickly.
Do you, by any chance,
have the police surgeon's report available?
FREDERICK: Yes, I do, sir.
SIR WILLIAM: May I?
FREDERICK:
You must keep this confidential.
SIR WILLIAM: Of course.
Thank you.
Wouldn't someone
have heard their screams?
Not if he cut their throats first.
Yes.
How can you be sure they wouldn't
react to seeing the Liston knife?
Grapes.
He offers them grapes first.
-Grapes are very tempting.
-They'd gobble them up.
He might offer them a drink
to ease them down.
A drink laced with laudanum.
SIR WILLIAM: How do you know that?
I found a sprig of grapes
on both victims' bodies.
And I smelled the laudanum on their lips.
Laudanum is a derivative of opium.
Apart from doctors and addicts,
not many would recognize it.
How long have you
chased the dragon, Inspector?
SIR WILLIAM: These should help
with the headaches.
Opium leaches minerals out of the body,
so I've also given you a tonic.
That'll help to restore your appetite.
Thank you very much, sir.
-I'm a fool.
-I don't think you're a fool.
Far from it.
I ought to have known that you're
physician ordinary to the royal family.
It's certainly an honor, but it's an honor
bestowed on many doctors.
Now, about our friend here.
He cut their throats from left to right.
Therefore, he's right-handed.
Excuse me.
He had to slice through
four layers of tissue...
...and up to an inch of subcutaneous fat.
After that...
...he entered the abdominal cavity, so he
would've used more than the Liston knife.
Perhaps he was carrying
a portable amputation kit similar to this.
What do you think?
Is it possible that the killer
is an educated man?
Perhaps someone who studied medicine,
but who is not a surgeon himself?
The intestines are simple enough,
but the uterus?
The liver, very hard to locate,
unless you know what you're doing.
And he was working quickly, in the dark.
I had held out hope that this...
...monster was a veterinarian or a furrier...
...or an especially well-educated butcher.
No, I must admit, if I were you...
...l'd look for someone with
a thorough knowledge of human anatomy.
Damn him.
Want me to suck it?
I can suck the Thames dry.
Don't be frightened, dearie.
QUEEN: How far advanced
is our grandson's malady?
SIR WILLIAM: No lesions have appeared.
There is some neural damage,
slight trembling of the right hand...
...but I'm more than hopeful,
the treatment will arrest the disease.
He seems, to us,
to be suffering greatly in his mind.
Is the disease affecting his emotions?
Yes, of course, his mood is depressed...
...because of the news of the diagnosis.
But that should improve
as he regains his strength.
You are a true physician, Sir William.
In all ways,
you attend to the health of our empire.
We are grateful.
Thank you, ma'am.
FREDERICK: This is the beginning
of a five-pointed star.
-Like the bloody Jewish star!
-Withers.
The Inspector is talking,
which means you are what?
-I'm listening, sir.
-Yes.
This area would form a likely point.
I want double shifts
within these streets until further notice.
And don't only worry
about Jews and butchers.
Stop anyone suspicious...
...including well-dressed gentlemen.
By the way, Withers...
...the Star of David has six points.
Right! "Once more unto the breach,
dear friends."
Dismissed!
THE RIPPER: Why have you called me here?
It's just...
It's just,
you say three more have to be killed.
I can't take it, sir.
It's everywhere.
It's in all the papers.
I'm just a simple chap, sir.
I'm not a great man like you.
I just don't know where I am at anymore.
THE RIPPER: There, there, Netley.
I shall tell you where we are.
We are in the most extreme
and utter region of the human mind.
A radiant abyss,
where men meet themselves.
I don't understand that.
I don't understand, sir.
THE RIPPER: Hell, Netley.
We're in Hell.
MARY: Let me go! Get your hands off me!
GODLEY: Sorry about that, Inspector.
She's madly in love with me,
although she hides it well.
You said McQueen killed your two friends.
What are you doing here?
I see. Women are butchered
right and left in your district...
...and you can't do piss about it,
and I'm the fool?
We're watching. Can't arrest them
without evidence, so we watch them.
FREDERICK: What else can we do?
MARY: I'll testify.
If you keep meself and me friends alive,
I'll testify.
To what, precisely?
McQueen said he'd cut me
unless I pay him £1 a week.
-No.
-What do you mean, "No"?
You asked me to testify.
Are you worried I'll let you down?
I won't. I promise I won't.
You testify against McQueen,
maybe he goes in for a year or two.
But his boys, they'll take their revenge
on you and your friends.
I can't let you do it.
WOMAN: It's your round this time!
MARY: I confess, I have an appetite.
One day, I'll be a great big, round woman
with a skinny little man for a husband.
And a dozen plump children, I imagine.
Do you think that's funny?
An unfortunate like me
being a decent mother?
No, I didn't mean that at all.
You'll be a wonderful mother someday.
Honest, I can see it.
I see you in a little cottage by the sea...
...surrounded by children.
I can see it, Mary, clear as day.
-I really do have visions, you know.
-Are you serious?
Sgt. Godley calls it my intuition.
As a matter of fact,
I have one about you in this case.
You have visions about me?
What might those be?
I want you to think carefully.
Besides McQueen,
besides these awful murders...
...has anything happened to you or your
friends that's a bit out of the ordinary?
Ben Kidney?
That's Special Branch she's describing.
What would Ben Kidney and
Special Branch be doing in Whitechapel?
Wait a minute.
She's Irish-born, isn't she?
There's your answer.
A secret Irish rebel.
That's why they'd be after her, right?
They were after Ann Crook, who was
having an affair with a wealthy gentleman.
A man she bore a child...
...a child that's now missing,
along with its grandparents.
Great.
Drive on, please, driver.
You do not fuck with Special Branch.
They fuck with you.
I don't know what you're thinking,
and I don't care to know.
-Mr. Kidney wants to see me.
-Mr. Kidney's gone, sir.
Didn't say where. Could be for the night.
No. He said he'd be back before 11:00,
and I should wait.
Where are you going?
He said I should wait in his office.
And what floor is Mr. Kidney's office on?
I don't know what floor, because
I haven't been to his fuckin' office, have I?
He told me the desk man'd let me up,
but I'm happy to stand here like a knob...
...because you disobeyed
Ben Kidney's order.
-lt's the second floor on the right.
-Thanks.
Godley: Free Ireland!
Free Ireland!
CONSTABLE #1: Get inside, sir!
Just some gunpowder, that's all.
Little more than a firework.
Anyone go in or out?
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir, there's
an Inspector Abberline in your office.
CONSTABLE #2:
No, there's nothing missing here.
CONSTABLE #3: Webster dossier
seems to be complete.
The bastards have been in here, sir.
I can smell them.
FREDERICK: No.
MARY: Yes.
FREDERICK: No, not together.
Too suspicious.
You wait for me, and if she's in there,
you can visit her on your own.
I'm going with you right now,
or I'm going to the newspapers.
I mean it.
There are a number of mental disorders
for which it is necessary to remove...
...the front part of the brain.
Her records indicate that she was violent...
...threatening to do harm to herself
and others.
-Does she have any relations?
-No, she's a ward of the state.
-That's a lie.
-Listen to me.
You're under arrest,
and here to assist my investigation.
-Keep your mouth shut! Is that clear?
-Sorry, sir.
Good.
What else do you know about her?
All we know is
that she was an unfortunate...
...who lived in the Whitechapel district.
I'd like to ask her a few questions.
You won't get any sense out of her.
I'm used to that.
FREDERICK: Hello.
I brought Mary Kelly.
Do you remember Mary Kelly?
Ann...
...you know me,
I'm your best friend in all the world.
Go away.
Go away.
I'm going to find baby Alice.
I'm going to take care of her.
Alice is laughing to me.
Laughing to me.
Laughing to me all day long.
MARY: It's all right, darling.
What about her father?
Have you seen Alice's father, Ann?
He's a prince.
A prince.
A prince. A prince.
And I'm a queen.
FREDERICK: How do you know
he was a painter?
MARY: He hired us to pose
as artist's models.
What exactly does that entail,
artist's models?
We stood very still, so he could paint us.
What's the matter?
You think I was born a whore?
I'm sorry, I'm an unfortunate, not a whore.
England doesn't have whores...
...just a great mass
of very unlucky women.
So Ann Crook...
...and the painter became lovers.
Is that it?
He married her in a lovely Catholic church.
Saint Savior's.
I was a witness, as a matter of fact.
Married her in a Catholic church?
What do you think they've done
to baby Alice?
MARY: Special Branch dumped her
in Bishopsgate?
FREDERICK: Yeah, as an unknown.
MARY: Why?
FREDERICK: When I find out, I'll tell you.
-Take me to her. You have to.
-No. Not yet.
FREDERICK: I need to know more first.
Look...
...I promise that I'll help you
with baby Alice, but not yet.
You've got to trust me, Mary,
at least a little bit.
I do. I do trust you.
Good.
Do you have little ones, Inspector?
No.
No.
A year ago... No, two years...
I'm sorry, more than two years...
...my wife passed away...
...giving birth to what I'm told was a son.
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
I want to show you some paintings
on the way out.
-You're going to take me into the gallery?
-Why not?
FREDERICK: Come on.
-Did you see the look on her face?
-I think she stopped breathing.
She's a fright.
Look at those cold eyes.
I feel like someone's walking
over my grave.
There's one more painting
I want you to see.
You know him, don't you?
PRIEST: "Those whom God has joined
together, let no man put asunder."
I pronounce that they be man and wife.
-Sir William Gull, please.
-Sir William isn't receiving visitors.
Sir William? It's Inspector Abberline.
I need to speak with you, sir.
Sir William is ill.
He can't receive any visitors.
FERRAL: I said...
...you can't go in.
SIR WILLIAM: It's okay, Dr. Ferral,
I don't mind company.
Have Anna bring us some tea,
would you please?
SIR WILLIAM: I wish I could tell you
that your story was fantastical.
Unhappily, I cannot.
I know for a fact that the Prince
has a taste in unfortunate women.
And I suppose
that it's more than possible...
...he concocted this elaborate deception...
...to have some privacy
while he indulged in his secret life.
But I know one reason I have for stating...
...that Prince Edward being Jack the Ripper
is just incomprehensible.
What's that, sir?
If you repeat what I'm about to tell you,
both our lives are in jeopardy.
Indeed, I hope for your sake
that what I'm about to say...
...will steer you clear
of the very real danger you're in.
I think I'm well past
the point of safe return, sir.
Prince Edward has syphilis.
Not a pleasant state secret, but a vital one.
That proves it.
I couldn't understand why the Prince
was killing Ann Crook's friends...
...especially so savagely,
but he's not merely killing them...
...he's punishing them.
He wants revenge. Don't you see, sir?
No, Inspector, I don't see.
I'm afraid your wild speculations
about the Prince's mental state...
...clever though they may be,
can't overcome the physical impossibility...
...of his committing these crimes.
The disease is far enough along
that his hands tremble uncontrollably.
He's very weak, and the killings
of Jack the Ripper require sure hands...
...and considerable vigor.
And have you forgotten
the most telling fact?
Whatever else the Prince may be...
...he knows little or nothing
of human anatomy.
MASON: ...to the center of
the lodge and force him to kneel...
...for the benefit of prayer.
Vouchsafe Thy name,
almighty Father of the universe...
...to this, our present convention.
MASON: Who is this?
FERRAL: A poor candidate
in a state of darkness.
He comes of his own free will,
perfectly prepared...
...humbly soliciting to be admitted...
...into the mysteries and privileges.
In all cases of danger and distress,
in whom do you put your trust?
In God.
How did he find out
about the unfortunate and her child?
He has that kind of cleverness you'll
sometimes find in the middle classes.
A cheap sort of intelligence,
but effective nevertheless.
Thank God that's not something
you're burdened by.
Yes, thank God.
MASON: Recite the solemn oath.
"Never to reveal our secrets...
"...under no less a penalty than
my throat be cut across...
"...my tongue be torn out by its root...
"...and that I be buried in sand
a cable's length from shore."
You don't think
Gull has confided in him, do you?
The old fellow isn't as far gone
as all that, is he?
No.
He's not that foolish.
Let the brother receive the light.
MAN #1: I keep on hearing...
WOMAN: ...no time to scream...
MAN #2: Another beautiful murder.
MAN #3: Fear me. Jack the Ripper.
They're rubbish. You know that.
Yes, I agree. They're rubbish.
But why you believe that red-headed
jezebel, I'll never know.
Has it occurred to you that she
might like to make up stories?
Particularly about men.
She is after all, a whore.
She's a woman who...
"A rose by any other name"?
Is that it?
Frederick, my dear chum,
no one is more delighted than I am...
...that you decided to resume your interest
in the fairer sex, but please remember...
...a woman like that can make a man feel
whatever she wants him to feel.
-Sgt. Godley.
-Yes, sir.
Arrest the Nichol Street gang.
-Right away.
-I tried to stop them, Inspector.
This arrived in this afternoon's post.
"I send you half the kidney I took
from one woman preserved for you...
"...the other piece I fried and ate.
It was very nice. "
We demand something be done,
and done tonight.
"From Hell."
At least they got the address right.
It can't be. Are you sure he was the same?
I know him. I posed for him twice meself.
I stood there naked as a babe,
watching him paint me for hours.
And he was with Ann for what,
over a year?
Nearly two.
Here you are. Hello, girls.
MARY: I told you to wait for me.
LIZ: I can't stay in a pub
and not have a drink.
It's cruel. But look who I bumped into.
Remember Ada?
She's from France.
Brux elles.
-Brux elles.
-Yes.
She is pretty, isn't she?
Not in public, love.
Would you give us a minute alone?
We need to speak with Liz.
Ada, you stay where you are.
Come on, Mary, get the drinks in.
Mary.
You don't have to worry
about Nichol Street for at least a week.
-I can keep them that long.
-That's something, anyway.
Thank you.
What about baby Alice?
Are you sure she's all right?
She's all right.
We'll get her out after this is over.
"We'll get her"?
Listen.
I want you and your friends
off the street until I can sort this thing out.
-For how long?
-A few days at least.
You better throw us in jail because
we have no money for food or a doss.
All right, take this.
Buy some food, get a room, and stay there.
Don't tell anyone where you're going.
I don't want to know.
In three days, come to the Ten Bells,
I'll leave a message with the barkeep.
What?
It's not enough?
I wish I could show you the little village
where I was born.
It's so lovely there.
It's by the sea,
where you said you saw me.
I used to think it too small
to spend a life in...
...but now I'm not so sure.
Don't.
What?
Do you think I'm paying you back?
I didn't mean it as business.
I'm still a woman.
They haven't taken that away from me,
not yet anyways.
OFFICER: Enough of that.
Now, lad, at least take...
Sorry, sir.
LIZ: One more turn.
And curtsy.
And we're done.
Don't be modest, girl.
They don't care what we do.
I paid for your supper, remember.
Stop shaking your head at me, you slag!
MARY: Leave her alone!
LIZ: She's my business, not yours!
-Liz, just be quiet for one bloody night.
-No, I fucking won't keep my voice down!
KATE: Don't go out tonight, it's not safe.
LIZ: I'll just get something
to sustain myself.
-I'll be right back!
-Don't be so fucking stupid!
-Do without for a night.
-No. I want a fucking drink.
Here we are.
Service records.
"Grenadier Guards. Lt. Benjamin Kidney."
There.
Just as you suspected.
FREDERICK: Before he joined
Special Branch...
...Ben Kidney served
in the Grenadier Guards.
Part of his duties included
assisting a field surgeon.
Let me tell you something of which
I am absolutely certain.
Assisting an expert is a different thing,
a very different thing...
...from doing it oneself.
FREDERICK: Think about it.
Someone's got to clean up after the Prince.
Whose job is it to take care
of the widow's messes?
You've turned into Othello,
do you know that?
Everything is a suspicion.
And like that tragic Moor...
...all your suspicions will end up
in your own demise.
Heaven's sake,
these women aren't just being silenced.
They're being murdered most brutally.
Why would Ben Kidney do that?
To scare people.
-To keep their mind off the real point.
-Which is?
Think what's at stake for Special Branch.
Prince Edward married Ann Crook,
a commoner and a Catholic.
Married her in a Catholic church,
they had a baby, a legitimate baby...
...who is in fact
heir to the throne of England.
All these women were there.
All these women were eyewitnesses
to an event...
...that could rip the empire to pieces.
KATE: Once she starts drinking,
she'll go all night, you know that.
-She knows how dangerous it is.
-She don't believe you about the Prince.
She thinks you're feeding that copper
candies to keep him interested.
Hello, sir.
THE RIPPER: Is anything wrong, my dear?
No, sir. For a moment,
I thought you were someone else.
THE RIPPER: Thirsty?
Always parched, sir.
THE RIPPER: Perhaps there is somewhere
nearby that we might go...
...while my coachman keeps watch.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This way.
Follow me.
It's this way.
Follow me.
I dropped my grapes.
No!
What the fuck are you looking at?
NETLEY: Shut up!
NETLEY: I hear someone coming, sir.
Sir!
It's one of them, isn't it?
The throat's cut the same way.
Yeah.
He didn't finish.
She's no less dead for that.
He won't be satisfied by this.
GODLEY: Wilkins.
Fetch the ambulance. Go on, run along.
THE RIPPER: Excuse me, miss.
You could be dead...
...right now.
But then there would be
too many bloody questions.
Ignore the old man's blathering.
Find a scapegoat,
or next time we won't care who asks:
"Whatever happened to
Inspector Abberline?"
We should hurry up, sir. It's clearing up.
THE RIPPER: Do you have
a piece of chalk, Netley?
Chalk, sir?
MAN: They found another one
in Mitre Square!
Nice work, Inspector.
You've encouraged him to do two a night.
FREDERICK: Out of the fucking way.
Catherine Eddowes.
There's some writing on the wall,
just down the road.
You should have a look at it.
GODLEY: "The Jews are the men that will
not be blamed for nothing."
It's hardly Shakespeare, but it'll do.
POLICEMAN: Madam, slow down.
Make sure you get the apron as well.
It was written by the killer, sir.
And how do you know that?
I was here three quarters of an hour ago.
This building, mostly Jews live here.
Is that right?
Yeah, that's right.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Ready now, sir.
Put that away,
and get out of here immediately.
Abberline?
-Wash that off.
-What?
-You heard me.
-lt's evidence, sir.
Listen to me.
In another hour, there will be
If those words are seen,
not a Jew in London will be safe.
We'll have mayhem on the streets,
so wash it off.
That's an educated hand, sir.
An educated man wrote that.
-Look for yourself.
-I don't have to look, I've seen it.
An educated man
knows how to spell "Jews."
I don't know what this refers to...
...but I'm sure it's got nothing to do
with the people who live around here.
Sergeant, I want two constables
to wash that off.
What are you looking to him for?
Wash it off!
Yes, sir.
FREDERICK: Six men have seen it already,
the Sergeant has copied it.
I'll remember these words
for as long as I live.
So all you're doing
is destroying its value as evidence.
No, all I am doing is taking charge
of an investigation...
...that you have bungled to the point
of gross inefficiency, and I've had enough.
You are suspended from duty, Abberline.
Inspector Abberline is suspended.
All of his privileges are cancelled.
You have not seen her, then?
If she comes around, give her this.
Long letter, eh?
FREDERICK: This is for your trouble.
The letter's private, you understand?
I understand.
MASON'S VOICE: Who is this?
MASON'S VOICE: Recite the solemn oath.
FERRAL: "Never to reveal our secrets... "
GODLEY: Grapes again.
Why grapes?
FREDERICK: This ain't killing for profit.
KIDNEY: He's not that foolish.
SIR CHARLES: You question my decision?
MAN: Find a scapegoat.
FERRAL: "...my throat be cut across... "
FREDERICK: This is ritual.
FREDERICK: "Jubela, Jubelo, Jubelum."
Jews.
It's me, Ada. Only me.
I bring everything for supper.
You little thief, I need this money.
I just take some money and buy food,
for me and for you. Is that bad, Mary?
It's fine, dear.
You're a good person, but listen...
...until I go away from London,
it's not safe for you to go out.
Understand?
I stay with Mary.
Beautiful Mary.
It's all right, darling.
You don't have to pay for your food.
Pardon?
Here's to our feast.
I'm so sorry to greet you like this,
Inspector...
...but I'm late for an appointment.
Will you excuse me
if I finish dressing while we talk?
-Please, go on.
-Thank you.
FREDERICK: I'd like to speak
about the Freemasons, if I might.
Yes.
The arrangement of the coins
at Dark Annie's feet...
...and also the locations of the bodies...
...form a pentacle star.
A pentacle star is the symbol
of the Freemasons, is it not?
SIR WILLIAM: Yes.
And how these women were killed...
...throats cut left to right...
...their organs removed.
They're reenactments, aren't they?
Reenactments of what?
The Jews.
The traitors who killed Hiram Abiff,
founder of the Masons.
That's how they were ex ecuted.
Yes, so the Great Book tells us.
So Jack the Ripper
isn't just merely killing whores.
He's executing traitors.
He's a Mason fulfilling a duty.
Yes, I'm afraid, Inspector...
...that you won't be permitted
to arrest him.
I don't want to arrest him.
The Ripper has one more traitor
yet to kill...
...and I will stop him.
Did they come to you, sir...
...as a loyal Mason?
Did they ask you to help them
cover up the Prince's secret marriage?
That's how it started, yes.
And then you discovered
the Prince had syphilis.
He's going to die of it, Inspector.
Would you like a tour
of the syphilis wards?
FREDERICK:
You're physician in ordinary to the Queen...
...entrusted with the well-being
of the heir to the throne.
Only you had reason to believe
that these unfortunates...
...these whores...
...these traitors...
...destroyed your life's work.
Below the skin of history...
...are London's veins.
These symbols, the mitre...
...the pentacle star...
...even someone as ignorant
and degenerate as you...
...can sense that they course
with energy and meaning.
I am that meaning.
I am that energy.
One day, men will look back...
...and say I gave birth to the 20th century.
You're not going to see the 20th century.
Roll up his sleeve.
FERRAL: Don't struggle.
You'll only make this more painful.
MAN #1: Are you all right?
MAN #2: There's someone under there.
MAN'S VOICE: Dr. Gull?
Yes.
MAN'S VOICE:
You were describing the human heart.
Yes.
Yes.
The human heart...
...is a dense and powerful muscle...
...much like the organic equivalent
of mahogany...
...and notoriously difficult to burn.
It's about the size of a fist.
It provides the motor power
for the circulatory system.
The heart contains two atria,
two ventricles and four valves.
SIR WILLIAM:
It is, in effect, a single pump...
...powering a double circuit.
In the adult, the heart rate averages
Such is the force of the heart beat...
...that if the body's largest artery,
the aorta, is severed...
...a six-foot jet of blood...
...is released.
MASON: ...fear no God.
Arise.
Your faith is well-founded.
MAN: Another murder!
Don't go in there. There's no need.
How bad is it?
She's in pieces, sir.
Sergeant, he can go in.
Give him to me.
He'll be taken care of. I swear.
-I want him.
-lt's over. He's done. I give you my word.
Fuck your word!
I'll bring every last one of you
fucking cunts down.
You and your fucking brothers.
Listen to me.
Your difficult situation has been
thoroughly discussed.
You are reinstated.
Indeed, you are promoted.
No! This is not helping anything.
Don't be a fool, Inspector.
You will be very closely watched.
MAN: You're all there now.
Where were you when this was happening?
WOMAN: All right for you,
standing around chatting. What about us?
Inspector Abberline is in charge.
Give him all the assistance he requires.
GODLEY: Remember,
you're being watched.
Men, clear this passage. Move them away.
POLICEMAN: Move back. Make way.
Shall we proceed, Inspector?
CORONER: Body lies in middle of bed.
Shoulders flat,
but axis of body inclined toward right.
The left arm is close to the body.
The forearm flexed at a right angle,
resting across the abdomen.
The right arm is slightly abducted
from the body.
It rests on the mattress, with
the elbow bent and the forearm supine.
The fingers are clenched,
indicating a struggle as she died.
Notice something, Inspector?
No.
No, go on.
Came in not long before dawn,
in a bit of a rush.
Left this for you.
MARY: "I know you asked me to wait.
"If I'm to be murdered,
I'd like at least to die in my village.
"I'm going to the orphanage
to collect baby Alice.
"Here's an address where you can find us.
"We'll wait for you eagerly.
"I know in my heart,
we can be happy living by the sea.
"Just as you saw.
"I hope to be with you soon, dearest.
"All my love, Mary. "
QUEEN:
We are deeply distressed, Lord Hallsham.
We asked Sir William to remove a threat
to our family and throne.
Not to engage in these ghastly rituals.
Of course not, Your Majesty.
That was unexpected.
On the other hand,
he has fulfilled his duties.
The threat is past, Your Majesty.
In his way, Sir William has been loyal.
And we are grateful for that.
The rest is in your hands, Lord Hallsham.
We wish to hear nothing further of this.
Knight of the East.
We are gathered here,
beneath the God of love...
...and before the sight of
the Great Architect, to judge this case.
You stand accused of mayhems that
have placed our brotherhood in jeopardy.
You stand before your peers,
Masons and doctors both.
I have no peers present here.
What?
No man amongst you is fit to judge...
...the mighty art that I have wrought.
Your rituals are empty oaths
you neither understand nor live by.
The Great Architect speaks to me.
He is the balance,
where my deeds are weighed and judged.
Not you.
Knight of the East...
...hear our judgment.
They're not watching you anymore.
I'm telling you, it's safe to go to her.
They think she's dead.
If I disappear,
or change my routine suddenly...
...they might wonder why.
GODLEY:
You know who you're going to turn into?
That old bugger in the pub
that nobody wants to sit beside...
...because as soon as he's had a few drinks,
he goes on about the girl who got away.
Is that what you want?
Do you want to live the rest of your life
like a ghost?
No.
What I want is to go to her.
But at the slightest hint she's alive,
they will spare no expense...
...and no trouble.
So I'll stay.
And watch them.
MARY: Alice!
Come here, darling.
Coming, Mother.
Get up.
Get up! Come on.
GODLEY: "Good night, sweet prince."
