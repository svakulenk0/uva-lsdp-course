It seem like only yesterday the
party would go on forever
but in just 12 short months the place
known as America's Spring Break Capital
has become a virtual ghost town.
Who can forget the devastating attack
on Lake Victoria that left scores of young
people dead and a community
in shocked and who
could've guess that
this hell on earth
would be rocked by a species
of Piranha believed to be
extinct for the 2 million years
A massive eradication program have left
these waters once teeming with life
silence and dead after a massive
exorcist most property abandoned
the local economy
fell in ruins. Lake Victoria is now a
quarantine area only weeds grow on
beaches where thousand once soaked-up
the sun and the only boats that remained
are dusty relics littering the shoreline.
As we look back from the anniversary
of this tragic event, we left to wonder
if it happened here can it happen again?
and if so, where?
I got my foot stuck
-There she is right there
-Is she dead?
You got big
Yeah, I took second place
in gunning last year
Oh hell, it something around its belly,
find out whats going on down there
There's something in there
-Holy-fine-baby-shit
-God-damn-piece-of-crap
I got a lighter, that smell is awful
That's just a gas you damn coward
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Get away
Hey, it's time to get wet again
Come on down, all my girls are hot
and single
and ready to party with someone like you
-You!
-Put her down boys
So, if you want to cool off, come
on down to the hottest hole in town
Remember double D's swims free
-Oh boy, hold on. Shut it!, shut it!
-Cut!
-Hey!
-Hai
I've to cut some off the pass, here you go
Keep them wet
-and are you guys friends of someone
-Maddy
Get over here and give your step dad a hug
Chet, tell me you did
not fire our old
life guards and replace
them with strippers
-Water-certified strippers
-Really?
-More than that pumpkin
-Unbelievable
Hey listen, before you sweet
mother died God-bless her soul,
she made me promised her to
keep this water park running
I am just going to make
sure that I provide
for you as well as she did, I'm your daddy
now, we're so lucky to have each other
Wow Chet sometimes I think you really
believe whats coming out of your mouth
Believe me doll, you're going to love this
Adult pool?
We are going to make BIG on this
-What do you think?
-I think this is very expensive joke
World's first strip club in a water
park, that's a stroke of genius
No, no, no
Oh, don't worry about that,
we put a little bit of
chlorine, sulfuric
acid into the pool,
it sanitizes everything
Hey Kiki, why don't you get your ass out of the pool
Russian, she's a doctor
Keep you eyes over there on the
flat screen TV
Check it out
That is disgusting
-Do not touch it
-I'm getting rid of it
Don't you touch it
That's not your call
Don't you forget that i'm
still half owner of this place
Oh! Is that right? Raise your hand if you
own 51% of this Water Park
Now, raise your hand if your
-Hey guys

-Okay, dear Lord

Welcome back Maddy

-The hole where the water comes out
-Oh God man
-It's so wet
Hey Shelby, have you seen
Ashley or Travis?
-Neither one of them punch in this morning
-No, I haven't seen either of them
I don't know
Just a sec
-You okay?
-I just feel a little weird
-It's okay
-Here, let me help you
No no I'm fine, really
Are you okay?
Well look who has morning sickness
Nice work papa
Nobody was inside Shel
-I'm sure they're just fine
-Probably shaken up and..
scare they're going to get in trouble
No
Come on, Ash, pick up
-Hello its Ash, leave a message
-Shit, call me
Is there anywhere else
they might have gone?
No, I don't think so
I'm just going to go
Ashley is my best friend
I know she kinda of a slut
She's still in love with my
ex-boyfriend
I'm pretty sure she
also stole a pairs of
earrings that my grandmother
gave me before she dies
but we kinda like sisters
What is that?
Oh my God
We have to get off this thing right now,
hurry
Come on, Shelby
Come on Shelby
grab my hand
Alright, come on, I got you
Oh my God, come on
Oh my God
Quickly
Lets go, we're almost there
No, no, no
Come back Shelby
Come here
You going to have to jump
Come on
You going to have to jump
Let go
Hurry it's just a foot
Alright, I got you
Oh my god
-What is this thing?
-Maddy?
What the fuck is that?
-Oh my God
-Shit
-Is that a fucking Piranha?
-My father
worked construction of a dam
they found fossil like this
when they first broke ground
-He gave me on my birthday
-I telling you man it was a Piranha
How did they get from
Lake Victoria to our lake?
That what we got to find out
What?
Look at us the cop and the marine biologist
I'm sorry but it sound
like a shitty sitcom
The cop and the marine biologist
You're still wet
A little, yeah
Can you open the door?
Kyle, Open the door
Just fooling around
It's funny
dick
Who are you? Why are you here?
Sir, we saw you on YouTube
You and 11,486,000 other people
I have 700 more hits than
the laughing diarrhea baby
We need your expertise
Mr. Goodman
Why?
We think they're back
Cross Lake isn't even connected
to Lake Victoria
The Piranha must be migrating
through underground lakes and rivers
I have studied this specimen
for almost a year
You evil
I think you might find this interesting
Okay, this is galvanized steel
like ordinary household plumbing
there we go
now with some incentive
-No, no, not the Frog
-Sorry
I sold out of puppies as a boy
Now I think this is
quite resourceful
watch
Now just something to grab
-You fuck
-Barry, are you crazy?
-You almost lost a hand
-I had a pet frog once
-Come on, help me
-Really?
-Now, lets check some data
-What're you thinking?
These Piranha spent eons
living in underground
lake and rivers full of sulfur dioxide
from all the geothermal activity
that's how they
come back to spore
-They follow the rotten eggs smell
-Yes
Problem is sulfur dioxide is
commonly released during the
shipment of chlorinating water
So its inconceivable that the
fish could become confused
and to enter man-made drainage systems
especially with those shocking
abundance of back yard pools
Our water park drain
directly into Cross lake
That's like equivalent to thousands
of swimming pools
That would be a very bad thing
Did you tell anyone that this could happen?
I tried, but unfortunately
I lost some credibility after my last book
"Foretold Dreadful..
Plague of Walking Fish"
Oh that’s right, you
wrote fish walk among us
I loved that book
This is really great
Well thank you
Thanks
Barry
You read a marine biology book?
Well I want to see what
you so interested in
Look guys, we got to check the drains
of the outflow pipe to the lake
tonight
I could get a dive team up here
of 10 people by tomorrow
No, that's too late.
The water park opens tomorrow
That place is going to be packed
if the fishes are getting through
the drain system
that would make Lake Victoria
look like an appetizer
Guys we got to get out there right now
Thank you so much for
your help Mr. Goodman
Thank you
-Thank you, sir, It's an honor
-Okay, be well
Take that laughing diarrhea baby
The two teen Ashley Sowerby
and Travis Mitchell
were reported missing this morning
after their van was pull out of
Cross Lake. No bodies were found
-Thanks for letting me stay here
-No, it was totally cool
How are you felling?
-A little better
-You don't seem any better
Hey what is it?
It just this stress of
the whole Ashley thing
Make love to me
-Please
-Right now?
Please Josh, right now
I think something is really
wrong with me
I feel a little bit better
I don't want to die a virgin
Josh, I want to be with you
Come inside me. I'll do what
ever you said after that
The outflow pipe down there
lead directly to the water park
I got to check them out
Considering how bad-crazy this is, right?
I got to take a look
I'll be quick
Look about what I'm
trying to say last night
Are you coming in?
Because I could really use a spotter
-What?
-I mean if you're
-It's okay
-No no I'm not scared
I can't swim
You work in the water park
and you can't swim?
What about all the beach parties in
high school or the parties at the park
You never
My god Barry, I totally would've
taught how to swim
I know, you seemed kinda
busy at the time
not a big deal
Toss me that torch light
Yes, I know, that is
what I said Chet
Chet Chet listen
I'll find you
Are you sure you want to do this?
No
You let her go in there alone?
-Fuck off Connor
-Oh yes, Barry can't swim
Maddy
-Maddy
-Maddy
Dive, Maddy
No
-Shit
-Get out of the away, get back
-Are you okay?
-I think so
Yes
Don't worry, I wont break
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry
-No, It's ok
I like it. Keep going
-Oh god Shelby
-Fuck me
Oh my God, yes
-Oh my God
-Oh my God
-Come on
-Oh my God
-Oh my God
-Something's wrong
-Oh my god
-Something's wrong
Almost there, almost there
Fuck
What the fuck is on my dick?
Oh my God
Oh my God
Damn, what's this?
Damn it
Oh my God
This is disgusting
Oh Jesus
Josh
I feeling a little better now, Josh?

Oh my God
Josh
Josh
Josh
Josh
Josh

You're going seventy
miles there buddy
Don't you have some place
else better to be?
-Like boning my step daughter
-I'll get to that
First thing first
-You're all good, for now
-Well you're looking for a raise?
With any luck your little
theme park is going
to take off and i'm going to
live off deputy salary forever
So, we're good here?
Yeah, did you check those
outflow pipe at the lake?
Maddy did
She almost got herself killed
How about the grades,
they're still intact?
Should be good, unless there
are another way in the park
-Like that boot leg weld you drilled
-Don't you worry about that
I do worry Chet
I'm the one protecting your unlawful ass
Let me tell you something
Why don't you worry keeping Maddy
and Johnny law off my ass
-I'll take care of my Water Park
-Okay
-Have a nice night deputy
-You too Chet
-Oh by the way
-What in the hell is this?
-I told you were speeding
-Are you shitting me?
Just doing my job
You're a crooked cop
What a night huh
So um..
You an Kyle, I guess you
get back together
No, definitely not
I don't think so, probably not
must be hard to make that decision
Kinda did, didn't I
Josh cut off his penis because
something came out of my vagina
Should we coming too short the
nurses are going to take you guys back
You guys can probably go
Josh is still sedated
and I'm going to stick
around to take a statement
I'll let you you guys
know if I found anything out
How's Shelby?
She's not making a lot
of sense right now but
I'll keep an eye on her too
How about you, you alright?
I'm pretty tired
Get some rest and I'll call you
I'm a Love Hunter, hear what I say
Get on your knees learn how to play
Cause a Love Hunter is coming

In case you haven't know

I hate water, I hate it
Remember what
doctor Smith's said
This is all about the road to recovery
strut out with harmless little kiddy pool
I mean, what the worst
that could happen
Couple of kids will
do to you, that's all
Kids...
I can handle that
I'm not afraid of some punk-ass water
I'm not afraid of some punk-ass water
I can't
Don't worry about it, we'll
figure out something else
No, this is weak
-Dump me in the water
-What?
You heard what I said, get
behind the seat, grab the handles
and dump my sorry ass in the water
The way the parent toss
their kid into the pool
when they want to swim
This is a great idea
Alright I can do this
-One, two
-Stop
-Okay okay right, what happened?
-Why you stop?
-You said stop
-Don't listen to my pussy-ass-mouth
No matter what I'll say,
dump me into the water
Okay got it
Not going to listen to
your pussy-ass-mouth
I mean you don't have
a pussy-ass-mouth
Dump me in the water
Okay, here we go
One, two..
