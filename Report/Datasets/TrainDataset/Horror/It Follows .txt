Hey, Are you okay?
Yeah.
You need some help?
No.
Annie, what're you doing?
I'm fine, dad.
What's the matter?
What's going on?
Annie?
Dad.
I love you.
I know.
I just want you and mom to know
how much I love you.
Dad, I'm sorry that I can be such
a shit to you sometimes.
I don't know why I do that.
Just know that I love you, okay.
I just really love you both.
Hey, Jay.
Hey, what's up?
Nothing.
How long you out here?
I'm going to watch a moive.
See if you like it?
Actually, I'm going out tonight.
That guy?
I like hm.
Me too.
I see you.
What're you reading?
The idiot.
Is it any good?
I don't know yet.
It's about Paul.
Hey, Jay.
Hey, Paul.
Stop.
Hey, I've an idea.
What?
It got away.
You ever played the 'Trade' game?
No, what is that?
It's people watching game.
My sister and I used to play
when we were bored.
You are bored right now?
No, shut up.
Let me finish.
Okay, how do you play it?
You start by watching the crowd.
Casually just go by the people
around you.
Okay.
Now, without telling me.
Pick a person you want to
trade places with.
It can be anyone,
for whatever reason.
Okay.
I got it.
Now, I get 2 guesses to figure out.
Who you pick.
And why you want to trade places with them.
Okay,
good luck.
That guy.
No.
Okay then.
Who you picked.
Him.
The dad?
No.
The son.
I mean how cool that'll be.
Like you whole life is out of you.
You know.
Come on
It's not like you are old.
You are 21
I know,
but.
Look how happy that kid is.
Plus, at that age you could go to the
barthroom anything time you want.
Total freedom.
Yeah.
Splashing his shirt right now.
Yeah, exactly.
I can never get away with that.
Okay, my turn.
Okay.
Okay, got it.
How about the girl in
the yellow dress?
Where?
Right there.
I don't see her.
Right there.
Are you teasing me?
I'm sorry, I just...
I don't...
Can we go?
I'm sorry, I just have to go.
If you uh... Can we... can we go
back into the car?
Is there someone in there
that made you want to leave?
Like an ex-girlfriend or something?
You said you saw a
girl in yellow dress.
Is that someone that you knew?
No, I just felt sick.
I feel better being outside.
Thanks for walking with me.
Mom knows you smoke.
Yeah but, she'll cry if
she actually sees it happening.
Or she'll just steal your cigarettes.
How's it going with you?
Good.
Honestly.
I don't know.
He was acting kind of weird last night.
Why?
He said he wasn't feeling well
but...
Something else was on his mind.
Have you.
No.
I know he wants to, but...
I don't know.
He seemed different last night.
Do you smell that?
Like uh..
cherry coke, bananas nicotine.
That's my favorite flavor.
I... love it.
Let's go back to the car.
That's funny.
I used to day dream about
being old enough to go on dates.
Driving around with my friends
in their cars.
I had this image of myself.
Holding hands with a
really cute guy.
Listening to the radio.
Driving along some pretty road.
Up north maybe.
And the trees start to change colors.
It's never about going anywhere really.
Some sort of freedom I guess.
Never old enough,
the hell do we go.
Jay.
You awake?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Don' t worry.
You're not going to believe me.
But I need you to remember
what I'm saying.
Okay?
This thing.
It's going to follow you.
Somebody gave it to me.
And I pass it to you.
Back in the car.
It could look like someone you know.
Or it could be a stranger in a crowd.
Whatever helps it to get close to you.
He could look like anyone.
But there is only one of it.
Help.
Help!
And sometimes.
Sometimes I think it looks like.
People you love.
Just to hurt you.
I see it.
Who is it?
You get rid of it,
okay.
Just sleep with someone
as soon as you can.
Just pass it along
If it kills you.
It'll come after me.
Do you understand?
What the fuck do you want?
Jay,
I'm doing this to help you.
Just to let you know,
it's real.
Help!
Help me.
Never go into a place that
doesn't have more than one exit.
It's very slow.
But it's not dumb.
Can I have some?
Yeah.
Listen to this,
“I think that if one is faced by
inevitable destruction -
if a house is falling upon you,
for instance -
come what may...”
That's why we're drinking on the porch.
Is you mom asleep already?
Almost for sure.
She wakes up at 5.15.
That would kill me.
So.
Where is Jay at?
On a date.
Your turn.
Who is he?
Somebody new.
Of course.
Your sister is so pretty.
it's annoying.
It is annoying.
Anyway, she's nice.
Is everything okay?
Don't let it touch you.
Jay!
What happened?
I don't know.
Those people are such a mess.
It was consensual.
Yeah.
And, you never see the woman before?
No.
Okay.
Have you ever been to his home?
I know where he live,
but...
I never went inside.
He said he was embarrassed where he lived.
Did she catch anything?
I don't think so.
Ah...
Poor Jamie.
Apparently he used a fake name
to rent a house in the city
The police searched the place,
they can't find him.
Oh my God.
Breaks my heart the things he said to her.
Some weird, sick.
And the afternoon, the evening,
sleeps so peacefully.
Stretched out on the floor,
here beside you and me.
Have the strength to force
the moment to its crisis?
Though I have seen my head
I am no prophet—
and here’s no great matter;
I have seen the moment
of my greatness flicker,
Among the porcelain,
among some talk of you and me,
To roll it toward some
overwhelming question,
Come back to tell you all,
I shall tell you all”—
Should say:
“That is not what I meant at all;
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Hello.
There's an old woman at school today.
And she's staring at me.
It was like she was following me.
Did you know her?
No, but she freaked me out.
I didn't go back to class.
Did she say something to you?
Hugh told me that.
He passed it on to me.
He said it was going to follow me.
That's all bullshit,
Jamie.
Yeah, I know.
What exactly is suppose to be
following you?
I don't know.
You should tell mom what you saw.
No.
Jay.
I'm worried about you.
I could.. stay over tonight,
If to make you feel any better.
- No.
- No.
Sleep on the couch
or something.
No.
Maybe just on the couch.
You should be more worry about waking up
and finding Paul humping you leg.
Um...
I choosing to ignore all these insults
to my character.
Just,
keep your door locked.
Look.
I'm going to stay up all night,
And keep an eye out for anything weird.
Nothing is going to happen,
okay.
I can't sleep.
Not in there.
That's okay.
Just sleep here.
Are you okay?
Everything is going to be cool.
That's funny.
I haven't spent a night over here
since we were kids.
There's a reason for that.
Shut up.
I'm...
serious.
It's cool spending time with you.
Yeah.
You're my first kiss,
you know.
I know.
Is that not yours?
No uh.
You were.
And then you kissed Kelly.
She told me.
You kiss your sisters,
that's kind of gross.
Do you remember,..
...the time.
That we found those
porno magazines,
...in the alley by Barry's pizza?
Yeah.
We're such stupid kids.
Ridiculous.
We are all
sitting out on Greg's front lawn.
With a dozen dirty magazines.
Just sprawled out everywhere.
and we were laughing.
And we didn't realised
how bad it was.
Oh, and Greg's mom.
Remember her face when she came out.
And saw us reading that shit.
And she scooped them up so fast.
And then she called me mom.
Kel and I got the sex ed talk
the next day.
I got one too.
What the fuck?
Go look.
There's a broken window in the kitchen.
But...
... there's no one there.
Are you sure?
Yeah. I mean whoever broke it
must have run away.
Maybe we should call the police.
I'm going to wake up your siser.
She should call.
Jay.
Jan.
Can you open the door?
It's in the house.
What's going on?
There's nothing in the house,
Jay.
I saw it.
Open the door.
Okay.
It's in the kitchen.
I'm not going to let anything
happen to you.
Open the door,
and we'll figure this out.
There's nothing out here.
Okay.
Jay, why don't you sit down.
I need water.
Oh, I got to need water.
Okay, I'll get you some.
No, stay here!
Is something wrong with me?
Look, somebody broke the window,
That really happened.
But I saw a girl in the kitchen.
Jay.
I love you.
You're okay.
You don't believe me.
Mom?
Mom, is that you?
No, it's me.
Yara?
Yeah.
Don't open the door.
See.
Everything's okay.
Oh...!
God...!
Wait.
Jay.
What are you doing?
Hey, Jay.
Wait!
Jay!
Jay!
You could've hurt yourself.
What are you doing?
I'm scared.
Me too.
We will figure it out.
You can't tell mom.
And she'll freaked out.
And she won't believe me.
I know.
It's okay.
What are you running from?
Do you see that?
I do.
It's...
It's a person.
Greg?
What the hell is going on?
You okay?
Someone broke into their house.
Shit.
Did you call the police?
I don't want to go home.
Where you want to go?
I... I need to find him.
The person who broke into your house?
No.
Hugh?
What did he really do to you?
Okay.
Are you leaving?
No, I'm...
getting my car.
Someone's got to drive. right?
God.
Hey,

I can still see it.
It's not done with me either.
Okay.
LIke I told you.
All you can do is pass it on
to someone else.
What the fuck are you talking about?
She can do the same thing I did.
It should be easier for her,
she's a girl.
Any guy would be with you.
Just sleep with someone else and
tell him to do the same thing.
Maybe it'll never come back.
This isn't real.
I swear to you.
This is just some fuck up game
Look.
I'm not safe either, Okay.
We shouldn't even be in the same place.
I'm sorry, your guys need
to get the fuck out of here.
Hey.
Watch it.
If it kills her.
It gets me.
It goes straight down the line,
whoever started it.
Jay.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't trying to hurt you,
okay.
Someone did this to me too.
Okay.
Who did this to you?
I met a girl at the bar.
Its a one night stand.
I don't even remember her name.
I think that's where it came from.
Jeff.
I don't believe you.
She might.
But I think you're a fucking liar.
What you're doing to
her is some fuck up shit.
Do you guys see that girl
right there?
- Yeah. - Uh huh.
- Yes.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Good.
Jay,
listen.
Wherever you are?
If someone walking
straight towards you.
But it is walking.
If you try falling off.
You could buy yourself some time, I think.
Decide if you want to give to someone else.
Um.
Greg?
Yeah.
Your mom is not going to freak out?
She won't even know.
It's really nice of you.
I love coming up here.
My dad,
he uh...
He used to take me hunting
a couple of times a year.
It's not like super nice,
but..
It's cool.
Have you thought about what he said?
What?
Maybe passing it on?
I don't know.
Still like sticking around when
everyone is going home?
It's been lonely.
I'm right across the street you know.
I remember.
I guess I should've been nicer to you.
You guys should get into the water.
You want to?
Maybe a little bit.
Come on.
Oh. Oh my God!
Help me.
Jay,
what is it?
Please help!
Help me!
What are you doing?
Jay,
please!
Stop shooting!
- What the hell are you guys doing?
- Don't open the door.
What did you do to the door?
We didn't do that.
It's trying to come in.
There's nothing out here.
Yes, there is.
Fucking son of a...
Greg?
Greg,
are you okay?
Greg?
Jay,
what do you see?
Wait!
Jay, wait!
Where the hell is my fucking car?
Have you seen it?
Nothing.
I'm waiting,
looking.
It's been 3 days.
I don't think it's coming.
You believe me,
right?
Not just playing along?
No, I... I...I believe you.
I just...
I just don't think it's following me.
Isn't that a good thing?
Yeah.
Hey.
How are you guys?
Okay.
How's uh...
How's Jay?
Not great.
You seen anything?
No.
Is it...
Is it cool if I go in?
I don't think so.
She doesn't want
to open her door.
She is just hiding in there.
Glad she's doing better.
I can have her call you later.
Yeah.
Okay.
You really haven't seen anything?
Nope.
She didn't make it up.
I'll know sooner or later
right?
That chair broke in mid air.
I mean something knocked me over and
the door didn't break on it own.
Look, something happened,
But it's not what she thinks. Okay.
What do you think it was then?
I'll see you guys.
- Bye, Greg.
- Bye.
Hi, this is Greg.
Leave a message.
Greg!
Open the door, Greg!
Greg,
watch out!
Greg, don't open the door!
What the fuck,
Mom.
Who is it?
Paul.
Hang on.
It's going to be here
soon or later.
You could
pass it on.
You did once.
Shouldn't have.
I could.
No.
I like you too.
You know.
Why you picked Greg?
I thought he'll be okay.
He wasn't scared.
He said to go to high school
wasn't a bigh deal.
I want to help.
Do you?
Yeah.
I do.
Jay?
Yeah?
Do you trust me?
Do you remember where we were.
The first time we kissed.
You know where to go?
I know how to go
there, you'll see.
I haven't been to the pool
since I was 14.
Who brought you there?
Okay.
That's where I had my first beer.
I threw up the whole night.
- In the pool?
- No, outside the car.
And in the car.
Paul used to pee in it.
Eww...
It's disgusting.
Whatever.
There is chlorine.
When I was a little girl.
My parents wouldn't allow me
to go south of 8th mile.
And I didn't even know what that meant,
until I got a little older.
And I started realizing that.
That's where the city started and
the suburd ended.
And I used to think about
how shitty and weird that was.
I mean.
I had to ask permission
to go to the state fair
with my best friend and her parents.
Only because it was a few
blocks past the border.
My mom said the same thing.
How long do you think it'll be?
I don't know.
Are you always that bad.
Oh my God.
It just walked into the room.
It's right there.
It's here?
Right there!
Jay,
what do you see?
I don't want to tell you.
Jay, I need you to point at it.
Okay.
Keep your finger aim at it
so we can see where it is.
Is it getting in the water?
It's just standing there,
staring at me.
It's moving.
What's it doing?
It's walking.
It's just walking.
- Paul, I want to get out.
- Not, just wait for it to get in.
No, I don't want to do this,
I just want to get out!
- What the fuck?
- Jay!
Out out of there!
She's going to get electrocuted.
No, it didn't working.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Didn't work.
- Thank god.
Jay,
look out!
- Oh my god, somebody help her.
- What do we do?
What the hell is going on?
Jay,
keep pointing at it.
It's right there.
Where is it?
Watch out,
don't get too close!
It's right there.
Yara!
Where?
Here?
- Here?
- Right there.
Where is it?
Jay!
Come on, Jay!
- Give me your hand!
- Come on, come on, come on!
Jay!
Jay.
Do you see it?
Is it still down there?
Do you feel any different?
Do you?
No.
"When there is torture, there
is pain and wounds,
physical agony, and all this
distracts the mind from mental suffering,
so that one is tormented only by
the wounds until the moment of death.
But the most terrible agony may not be
in the wounds themselves,
but in knowing for certain
that within an hour,
then within ten minutes,
then within half a minute,
