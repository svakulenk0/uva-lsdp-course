Operator, haven't you been able
to get me the express office
at Islamorada, Florida yet?
Yes, I know it takes time to
call from London to the States.
But please hurry.
It's terribly important!
Answer that phone.
Answer the bell!
Answer the phone!
Which do you want me to answer first'?
Both of 'em.
Both of 'em.
Both of 'em!
Hold the line,
please. Thank you.
I'd like to have my grip, please.
Yes, ma'am.
Let me see that. Well, they
came in on the last train.
We haven't unloaded the truck yet.
Go out and get the lady's grip.
Hurry up.
Excuse me... Excuse me, please.
Lady, here's your bag.
What are you trying to do,
ruin the lady's baggage?
Where is it?
This one.
There you are, Madam. I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Now come on, clean this all up.
Come on, straighten it out.
Wilbur, darling,
are you all right?
Sandra, I hurt my
poor little head.
Your head?
Oh no.
Does this hurt'?
Uh-uh.
Does that hurt'?
Uh-uh.
Thank heaven.
If anything happened to you,
dearest, I'd never forgive myself.
That kiss made
everything all better.
You worry about me
an awful lot, don't you?
You mean an awful lot to me.
Tell me more.
I will.
At dinner tonight.
Come on, gel up out of
there and go to work!
That is, if your head
doesn't bother you too much.
His head is all right. It is, eh?
But is your head all right?
Certainly.
Frankly, I don't get it.
And frankly, you never will.
I can't understand that dame.
Of all the guys around here, that classy
dish has to pick out a guy like you.
What's wrong with that? Go look at
yourself in the mirror sometime.
Why should I hurt
my own feelings?
Go answer the phone.
Go ahead, I'll pick these up.
Baggage room.
London? Calling here?
This ain't collect, is it'?
Oh, all right. Put him on.
Hello? Do you have two crates addressed
to the McDougal House of Horrors?
What's the number on the checks?
Never mind that.
Tonight, the moon will be full here.
I haven't much time.
Now, listen closely. I'm
flying out of here at dawn.
Under no circumstances are you to
deliver those crates until I arrive.
Understand? Under...
Mr. McDougal, will you
stop gargling your throat?
Hey, you'll have to get your
dog away from the phone.
I can't hear a word
you're sayin'.
You're awful silly to call me
all the way from London,
just to have your
dog talk to me.
That's great conversation.
The guy growls like a wolf.
The nerve of some people!
Well, what can I do for you, bub?
I'm in a hurry.
I have two crates here addressed
to my House of Horrors,
and I want immediate delivery.
My name's McDougal.
McDougal? But, I just talked to
you on the telephone from London.
How'd you get here so fast?
They shoot you out of a cannon?
Are you crazy? I've
been here all the time.
Now, get me those crates!
How long you been here?
Five minutes.
What are you beefing about?
I've been here five years,
you don't see me going around
like that and yelling...
There's the insurance slip and
there's the bill of lading.
Now get me those crates!
Look, will you
please stop yellin'?
Come here. You know, it's
impolite to raise your voice.
Oh, Chick!
Why didn't you give me
these in the first place?
Chi... Chick, this man
wants these crates.
Hmm. Insured for $20,000.
We'd better look these up.
Must be valuable.
I'll say they're valuable.
Wilbur?
Yes, Sandra?
He's busy,
he's busy. Please.
That little fellow's impossible.
Hurry up with those crates!
Do you know what I've got in there, miss?
Haven't the slightest idea.
Just the greatest attraction the House
of Horrors ever had, that's all.
One of them's a coffin containing the
remains of the original Count Dracula.
And the other's the body
of the Frankenstein Monster.
Guess that combination's
enough to scare the pants...
I mean, shirt right off
your back, ain't it?
I don't scare easily. Neither
do I, where money's concerned.
I got 'em dirt cheap. European agent
picked my name right out of thin air.
Very interesting.
Yeah.
Mr. McDougal.
Hey, Chick, here's one.
Darling...
Yeah?
Darling, I have to run along.
Somethings come up.
That means we'll have to
break our date tonight.
It ain't another man, is it?
Of course not.
Silly boy.
Oh, yeah.
Boy, I'm floatin'
on a cloud of love.
Listen, you little blimp,
I'll let the air out of you in a
minute, if you don't give me a hand.
You understand that?
Thank you.
Boy, is this kid lost.
Come here. Take that rope
and get up on top that box,
and tie it to that
handle up there.
Okay. Nothing
matters no more.
I'm so happy.
Go on, get up there!
Here it is.
Hold still now.
Oh!
Chick!
Stop him! Is he
trying to ruin me?
Keep your shirt on.
You're insured.
Yes, and if those exhibits are
damaged, I intend to collect.
Well, there you are. Shall I wrap it up?
No, you idiot.
You're gonna take those down to my
House of Horrors and uncrate them.
Because if that's the way
you handle baggage,
I'm going to have the insurance
agent there to inspect them
before I accept delivery.
Well, then it's gonna cost you
overtime because I'm a union man.
And I work only 16 hours a day.
A union man only works
eight hours a day.
I belong to two unions!
Get those down to my place!
All right.
Hey, Wilbur, here's a key.
Open the door.
I'm not gonna like this.
Come on, gimme a hand.
Come on, get it inside.
Well, pull it! You want
me to do all the work?
Come on, help
me with it, will ya?
Oh...
What's the matter now?
Somebody's got a knife in my back.
Oh, nonsense!
Where's the switch?
Here.
Sandra should see you now.
Turn around. Look what
you're afraid of.
Turn around!
Come on, get up on your feet.
It's only a dummy.
Dummy nothin'. It was
smart enough to scare me.
Come on, get a hold
of the box. Go ahead.
All right, come on,
swing it around.
Well, help a little bit!
Oh, oh!
Come on, you fraidy-cat.
These things can't harm ya.
They're made out of wax.
You know, people pay McDougal
to come in here and get scared?
I'm cheatin' him. I'm
gettin' scared for nothin'.
Go ahead and push, now.
Don't knock anything over.
There we are. Now, we get the
dolly out from underneath there.
Lift up that end.
Lift it up!
Come on, come on.
There you are.
Well, put it down, put it down.
Do I have to do all the work?
I'll get it down.
Well, put it down.
Go ahead.
Now, open it up.
I'm going out and get the other crate.
And no back talk!
I've got just two words to say to you.
What is that?
Hurry back.
Hello? Yes, Mr. McDougal.
Yeah, the crates are here.
Wilbur's opening one right now.
Everything's all right.
Okay, Mr. McDougal.
Goodbye.
Chick? Oh, Chick!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Did you turn out the light?
Certainly not.
They're out.
So what'?
Maybe the lightning struck
the power line or something.
I get in more messes
around here...
Never mind,
take off that canvas.
Take it off'?
Take it off!
Hey, a coffin!
Coffin.
The Dracula crest.
Dracula's crest.
I wonder if Mr. McDougal expects people
to think that Dracula's really in there.
No, don't. Please don't.
Oh, now come, come, come. Dracula
was just a legendary character.
He never existed.
No?
Certainly not.
Fold up this canvas. I'm going
out and get the other crate.
If you want me, just holler. Holler,
"Oh, Chick!" You understand?
Oh, Chick!
What do you want?
What kepi you?
I haven't left yet.
The next time,
don't take so long.
Come on. Fold this up. Get busy.
“Count Dracula sleeps in this coffin,
but rises every night at sunset."
Chick is right.
This is awful silly stuff.
"Dracula..." ..
Chick! Chick!
What's the matter now? You
know that person you said that
there's no such person?
Yes?
I think he's
in there, in person.
I was reading this sign over here, this
one down here, "Dracula's Legend."
All of a sudden I heard...
That's the wind.
It should get oiled.
Listen, stop reading this thing.
That's a lot of phony baloney
to fool McDougal's customers.
Now, fold up that canvas.
Get busy. Come on.
"Dracula can change himself
at will into a vampire bat,
"flying about
the countryside."
Flying.
Chick!
Chick!
Listen, you're making enough
noise to wake up the dead!
I don't have to wake him up.
He's up. I saw a hand.
You saw a hand? Where?
Right over there.
Let me see it.
Right over here.
Where is it'?
I saw a hand there!
You don't know what
you're talking about!
You're all excited reading this legend.
Now, listen. Listen, Wilbur.
I know there's no such
a person as Dracula.
You know there's no
such a person as Dracula.
But does Dracula know it?
Now, listen to me.
McDougal will be here any minute
with the insurance agent.
Now get to work!
"He keeps himself alive by
drinking the blood..."
Chick. Chick.
Chick.
Chick. Ch...
Chick!
Now, listen, this is
getting to be ridiculous.
What? What?
Are you trying to tell
me that candle moved?
Look, wait a minute. Candles can't move!
This one did.
Yeah, there. Watch it.
Keep your eye on it.
Is it moving? Huh?
It's not moving, is it? Not now.
Well, use your brains a little bit.
Let's get this job finished.
"He keeps himself alive by drinking
the blood of his victims."
"Count Dracula must return to his
coffin before sunrise. He..."
Chick! Chick!
Oh, Chick! Chick!
Chick!
Oh, Chick, come on!
Come on!
All right, I'm comin'.
Come on, will ya! Now, wait a minute.
What's wrong now?
Oh, Chick!
You gonna tell me that candle moved again?
Yeah, yeah.
I told you not to
read this, didn't I'?
I can't help it. I can't help it.
Oh, stop.
"Count Dracula must return
to his coffin before sunrise,
"where he lies helpless
during the day."
That's the bunk! That's
what I'm trying to tell ya.
That's his bunk!
Come here.
Oh, don't, Chick. Come here. Come here!
Come around here!
Come over here.
Look in there.
Now, do you see anything?
No.
Certainly not.
Come on, help me open
that crate. Come on.
CHICK: Come on, get with it,
will you please?
CHICK: Come on, get with it,
will you please?
You can always...
"Frankenstein's Monster." Get a
load of this here. Come here.
"A scientist named
Frankenstein made a monster
"by sewing together parts
of old, dead bodies."
Do you have to read that stuff'?
Wait a minute.
"Frankenstein gave the monster eternal
life by shooting it full of electricity.
"Some people claim it is not
dead even now, just dormant."
Now, who'd be silly enough
to believe that?
Who would be silly enough
to believe that? Yeah.
Me.
Come on, open up that crate.
Chick, did you hear that?
Yeah, I heard you pulling the
nails out, certainly. Go ahead.
Pulling the nails?
Chick?
Oh, quiet.
I don't want to hear any more
of your foolish questions.
Come on, open up
the crate, will you?
There we are.
You've got it.
Now get a hold of it.
Throw it right on the side.
That's it, fine. Now, come on,
help me with this excelsior.
Come on, take it all
out. Get it off him.
Wow! Look out!
Chick, cover it up!
What's the matter? Wait a minute.
Cover it up!
Cover the whole...
What's the matter with you?
Stop that!
Now you did it.
McDOUGAL: Hey, what are you doing
in there with the lights off?
Hey, McDougal!
Now we're in trouble.
Hide that head.
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Master.
Yes.
DRACULA: Come. Follow me.
Don't be afraid.
He won't hurt you.
Come!
Hurry up. Come.
This better be a good one.
What's the matter, you
afraid of the dark'? No.
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.
What is this?
Hey, Wilbur, McDougal is here. I...
What's the matter with you?
Come on, snap out of it.
Where are they?
Where are my bodies?
What bodies?
There were no bodies.
We opened both crates. I showed
it to Wilbur. Look in there.
If they're not here, where are they?
I don't know.
They must be stolen.
My company inspected
the contents before
they were shipped.
Then they must've
been stolen en route.
You mean, you saw mam'?
No, no, no.
Well, then where did they go?
I don't know.
If they're gone, I want my
insurance money. I'm sorry.
My company doesn't pay off
until a full investigation.
Did you hear that? If you
don't produce those bodies,
I'm going to call the police!
Police?
Police!
I can do better
than that. Police!
I'll get you.
Police!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Come on, go, get on.
Let's take it out.
Come!
Good evening,
Dr. Mornay.
My dear Count, it's so
good to see you again.
And you look more charming
than when I saw you last.
Come in, Count Dracula.
Thank you, Sandra.
But the name
is Dr. Lejos.
I wouldn't want to frighten
your technical assistant.
Professor Stevens?
Don't worry. He's completely
engrossed in his work.
Besides, he should be
out of here by tomorrow.
Excellent
Yes, except that he's asking
too many questions.
I will take care of that.
Is everything else arranged?
Yes. Where did you leave him?
In the cold.
I'll get a wrap.
Nervous, my dear?
This is risky business.
Not as risky as those curious
operations of yours,
that so intrigued the European police.
Yet much more profitable.
Restore the monster for me, and
you shall have anything you wish.
In that case, we better
start as soon as possible.
It's dangerous to leave him
in this weakened condition.
Have you mastered Dr.
Frankenstein's notebook?
Let me get my hand on a scalpel
again and you shall see.
And about the brain?
I don't want to repeat Frankenstein's
mistake, and revive a vicious,
unmanageable brute.
This time the monster must
have no will of his own.
No fiendish intellect
to oppose his master.
There, my dear Count, I believe I
have exceeded your fondest wishes.
The new brain I've chosen
for the monster is so simple,
so pliable, he will obey
you like a trained dog.
Good. How soon?
The day after tomorrow. Wilbur was
taking me to a masquerade ball.
But I'm sure he'd prefer to
spend a quiet evening at home.
Bring him through here.
I tell you, Chick, I saw
what I saw when I saw it!
Keep quiet! You babbling about
dead people walking away!
That's why we were arrested
and thrown in jail.
Do you realize that we've spent
a whole day and night in jail?
And we'd still be there if some
dame hadn't've bailed us out.
Chick, now stop calling
Sandra a dame!
And I'm tellin' ya,
they were there.
Oh, stop.
Two of 'em.
One of 'em was
about eight foot tall.
Way up there!
And he walked like this.
Just like that.
Now, that's the way he walked.
Stop it.
You don't believe that?
Certainly not!
Well, I saw it.
And the other one,
he went like this.
And he kept gettin'
closer and closer.
He had eyes that
were balls of fire.
He kept staring, eye to eye.
Eye to eye! Staring!
I never saw anything
like it in my life.
Believe me, Chick, when I tell
you I was scared to death.
Really I was. I was
really scared, Chick.
What's the matter? Chick?
What did I do?
Hey, Chick, I don't like you like that.
Come on, be just like you used to be.
Go away with it!
Attaboy! I'm happy.
That's just like you used to be.
All right. Now, stop this nonsense!
All of it.
You're Wilbur Grey?
Yes, sir.
Then you must be Chick Young.
So what?
I'm Lawrence Talbot. I've been
looking all over town for you.
You didn't have to look far.
We were in jail. Yes, I know.
You see, I'm the one who telephoned
you not to deliver those bodies.
I knew they were alive!
There you are, so you thought
I was imagining things, huh?
When I told you about the fellow
that was eight-foot tall,
and walking like this with the stiff legs,
and then the other fellow with this here.
Wait! Wait a minute. You're
crazy, and so is this screwball!
Look, bub, I have my own troubles.
Worse than you think.
I followed Dracula all
the way from Europe,
because I believe that he's going to try
and revive the Frankenstein monster.
We must find him and destroy
him before he can do this!
Wait a minute, why don't
you go down to the police,
tell them you know the story
about Dracula and the Monster.
They'd be very interested.
I can't do that.
Because then I'd have to
tell them who I am and...
Why I know what I know.
Soon... Soon the
moon will rise.
I haven't time to explain.
I've taken the room across the hall.
Here's the key. Lock me in!
Lock you in?
Yes, please. Hurry!
It's silly, but I'll do it.
He's scared too.
Remember, no matter what
you hear or what happens,
don't let me out!
“Lock me in." That guy is
screwier than you are.
He is not.
He's a nice man.
He's just worried about the police getting
him because he knows they're alive.
I'm going to bed.
Well...
Hey, he forgot his bag.
Mr. Talbot,
you forgot your grip.
Mr. Talbot?
Mr. Talbot?
Mr. Talbot?
Now, how'd he get out of here?
Hmm.
I'll leave him a note.
"I left your bag in the bedroom.
"Wilbur."
I wonder if he counted these.
He might've.
Maybe he didn't
Hmm.
A fine insurance company
I'm doing business with,
outsmarted by
a couple of morons!
Those two crooks got
out of jail. On bail!
We know that, Mr. McDougal,
but you see we...
In fact, I arranged it.
You? Who are you?
This is Miss Raymond, an
investigator from the home office.
It's my job, Mr. McDougal, to
find those missing exhibits.
I'm quite sure I can persuade the chubby
little fellow to lead me right to them.
Naturally, I couldn't persuade
him very well in jail.
Wilbur, please! I've had
nightmares all night long!
I don't want to hear any
more about dead bodies.
I saw what I saw when I saw it.
All right.
Boy, am I glad to see you. Will
you go over and talk to that guy?
Sandra! Wilbur darling,
I heard what happened.
That's awful. They can't put
my little Wilbur in jail.
They can't, but they did.
Sandra, I wanna thank
you for bailing us out.
I? I only learned
about it this morning.
Well, didn't the policeman tell
you that a lady bailed us out?
He did.
Wilbur, pet' you haven't been
untrue to your Sandra'?
Sandra, how can you look me
in the face and say that?
How can you look him
in the face, period?
I only came by to remind you about
the masquerade ball tonight.
I was just getting ready
to pick up my costume.
Come by for me early,
dearest. About sunset.
Alone. Goodbye.
What I'd like to know is, what
has he got that I haven't got?
A brain.
Brain. I'd like to
know where it is.
forgot to kiss me goodbye.
Now, who is this? She's... She's...
She's beautiful.
I'm Joan Raymond.
She's Joan Raymond.
I'm the girl who arranged
your release from jail.
Well, why should you
want to spring us?
Do you believe in
love at first sight?
Well! As long as you
put it that way, I...
That's what happened to me.
Wilbur, darling!
Miss Raymond, when did this mad
feeling first come over you?
The instant I saw you
in the baggage room.
I knew then that I wanted to spend every
single minute that I'm in town with you.
You did?
What are we doing tonight?
He's going to a masquerade ball.
But I'm not doing anything.
In that case, you'll be awfully lonesome.
Well, naturally...
Wilbur darling, I haven't been
to a masquerade ball in ages.
I was just hoping you'd ask me.
Wilbur! Come here.
Miss Raymond'
will you excuse me?
Oh, you irresistible boy!
Do you want me? Yes, I want you.
Come over here.
I just wanted to get a good
look at you in the light.
I still don't get it.
Jealous?
Wilbur, I'll have to go
out and get a costume.
That's funny. I was
just going, too.
I'll go down to my room and pick up a
couple things and meet you in the lobby.
All right. In the lobby.
I'll get my hat and coat.
I'll be right with you.
Excuse me.
Look.
Now you've got two dates. What
about Sandra, you bigamist?
Sandra? I don't know.
Joan is awful cute.
All right, you take Joan, I'll take Sandra.
Oh, Sandra sends me-
Well, then I'll take Joan.
Joan sends me too.
Now, listen, you
sawed-off Romeo,
in a minute, I'll send you!
You don't even appeal to me.
Look, Wilbur, we've always
been pals, haven't we?
Oh, yes.
We've always shared,
and shared alike, haven't we?
Well, now, look, let's be reasonable.
Come on.
I've always shared with you.
That you have!
If I had two cigarettes, I'd give you one.
That's right.
And if I had two pair of
shoes, I'd give you a pair.
Don't I know that?
And if I have two girls...
Well?
Why don't you light that cigarette, put on
those shoes and take a walk for yourself?
That's what I'm going
to do, but with you.
This key don't fit.
This is... Talbot's key.
Hey, we forgot about him.
Boy, what a bender he
must've been on last night!
Hey, Mr. Talbot.
Mr. Talbot!
And I thought you were such a
nice man, too. Look at yourself.
You're a mess!
Last night...
I went through another
of my horrible experiences.
Years ago I was
bitten by a werewolf.
Ever since, when
the full moon rises,
I turn into a wolf myself.
Oh, pal, that's all right.
I'm sort of a wolf myself.
And here I thought...
I thought that you were the
only one that would believe me,
that you were the one that
knew that I spoke the truth.
You have seen the living dead.
Mm-hmm.
I came all the way from Europe,
because Dracula and the
Monster must be destroyed.
Together we must find them!
Oh no, now, wait a minute. Let's
not start that all over again.
I can't go. I've got a date.
In fact, I've got two dates.
But you and I have
a date with destiny.
Let Chick go with destiny.
Won't you please?
You two kids stay here.
I'm going up and get Sandra.
She's mine too.
Pardon me just
a minute. Wilbur!
Now, look, you've
got Joan and Sandra.
You've got two girls! How about
the two girls we had last week?
Let's not talk about that.
You got no kick comin'.
I'm not kicking.
You had the best lookin' one.
So what?
You rs had teeth. Look,
Wilbur, yours had teeth too.
Did you see that tooth?
Yes, I happened to see it.
Mine had so much bridgework, every
time I kissed her I had to pay toll.
What's the use?
Wilbur, can't we both
go along, too?
Yes, mon amour. That's Spanish.
That's French.
How do you like that? I speak French too.
Oh, you cute little devil!
Stop that.
Come on, lead the way.
Come on.
Hello.
Hello.
Is Sandra in?
Who?
Sandra. You mean, Dr. Mornay?
Well, if that's what she is, I'm
just what the doctor ordered.
Come in.
Thank you.
I thought this Sandra
was your date.
Or did we both come along
for the ride? No, no.
Perhaps I should introduce myself.
I'm Professor Stevens.
This is Miss Raymond, This is
Wilbur Grey, and I'm Chick Young.
How do you do, Miss Raymond?
How do you do?
I have work to finish, but it shouldn't
take more than a few minutes.
If you'll wait in the
library, I'll be right down.
Just to keep the records clear.
We're here to pick up Sandra.
Of course. I'm sure she's
around somewhere.
Wilbur!
Sandra, hello.
That girl, who is she?
She's Chick's date. She's going
to the masquerade with us.
But I told you to come here alone.
We'll have to get rid of them.
I'll have to get
rid of somebody.
Hello, Sandra.
Hello, Chick.
Joan, this is Sandra.
Sandra, Joan.
Nice place you have here, Doctor.
Who told you I was a doctor?
Why, the young man
who answered the door.
Oh, Professor Stevens.
I'm on a vacation, you see,
and traveling incognito.
What are you doing here?
Same thing.
Shall we get going? Just as
soon  I put on my costume.
Would you like to powder your nose?
I'd love to.
I'll be right back, Wilbur.
I'll be right back, too, Wilbur.
Toodle-oo!
Chick, there's a time in everyone's
life when they get in trouble.
I'm in a mess of it right now.
Now, what's wrong?
I've got two girls.
You know the old saying?
"Everything
comes in threes."
Now, suppose a third girl
should fall in love with you?
What's her name?
We'll say her name is Mary.
Is she pretty?
Beautiful.
Naturally, she'd have to be.
Now you have Mary, you have
Joan and you have Sandra.
So, to prove to you that I'm
your pal, your bosom friend,
I'll take one of
the girls off your hands.
Chick, you're what I call a real pal.
It's all right.
You take Mary.
We better answer that phone.
They're all upstairs.
Hello.
Hello?
Is Dr. Lejos there?
Just a minute. Somebody wants
to know about a Dr. Lejos.
I don't know him.
Hello? Who is this speaking?
This is Wilbur Grey.
I thought I recognized
your voice.
This is Talbot speaking.
Listen. I just got a line
on Dracula and the Monster.
A certain Dr. Lejos has been receiving
a lot of electrical equipment,
just the type necessary
to revive the Monster.
So what? I'm way
out on an island.
I've got my own problems.
Yes, but listen.
I believe you're in the
house of Dracula right now.
You can find the
Monster, and I'll...
Hello?
Come here!
Chick, you don't know what
you're doin', son!
What's the matter with you?
Quiet. Come here.
You didn't hang up the phone.
Let him hang up the phone.
Who?
Dracula.
Dracula and the
Monster live here.
Wait a minute. Don't start that again.
Who told you that?
Talbot. He also said that
we got to search the place.
Come here.
Come over here.
Now, listen, Talbot, enough is enough.
Now, Wilbur's scared to.-.
Hello? Hello'? He's gone.
So am I.
No, you don't. Come here. I'm gonna
settle this thing once and for all.
We'll search this place. Look,
Chick, it's a little past sunset,
and if Dracula is here, he's
gonna be wanting breakfast.
And I'm fatter than you,
and it ain't gonna be me!
Now, just a minute. Just a minute.
It ain't gonna be me!
Wait a minute, I'm gonna prove just how
crazy both you and Talbot really are.
We'll search this place,
right from the basement.
Look, Chick.
What?
We'll search it.
That's more...
You and I together.
Now we're talkin'.
Attaboy. You search the
basement, I'll search outside.
Oh, no, you don't!
All right, then,
I'll search on outside,
and you search the basement.
That's different.
It worked!
Come on!
Now, let's look around here.
There's some doors down there.
You think we oughta tell
Sandra where we're goin'?
Certainly not.
You look over there.
Well?
Broom closet.
What?
Broom closet? Look out.
Come on.
Broom closet?
Come on!
Wait for me.
Come on.
Oh!
Chick! Open!
Whoa!
Chick! Come on. Chick!
Chick! You search down there
and on the inside. Shh.
Stop!
It's the truth. Come here.
All I did was like this.
Now, Chick, I tell you,
right over there.
Where are they?
Where are they?
They're in there. They're in there.
Now, listen.
Wait a minute. I'm gonna look around.
You go ahead.
If I don't find anybody,
I'm gonna beat your ears off.
I'm telling you, Chick. Honest.
Well, wait here.
They're over there. Oh, no. I ain't
goin' near that place anymore.
Whoa! Ooh!
Open sesame!
Open sesame!
Well, where are they?
They must be in there.
Oh, stop. Now, listen Wilbur, I'm getting sick
and tired of this silly nonsense of yours.
Some guy going around...
No, no.
Another guy goin'...
No, no!
The one guy goes...
The big...
And the other guy,
not like that, like this.
Yeah. All right, all right, all right.
Put your hands down.
Come on, the girls are waiting
for us upstairs. Come on.
Have you known Wilbur long?
Yes, we're old friends.
Will you belong?
Just a few minutes.
Miss Raymond?
Yes?
I'm ready. Shall we go?
Of course.
Here's your purse, dear.
Thank you.
Who screamed?
You did!
I did?
Now, listen, Wilbur, if you don't
stop imagining these crazy things,
I'll take you to a doctor
to have you examined.
But I'm telling you, I saw them. And when
I see what I see, I saw it. That's all.
Because Mr. Talbot,
same way, he saw it too.
Talbot! He's crazy.
You're both crazy!
Sandra.
Sandra, I've just gotta tell you.
I was downstairs in the basement.
Basement? And what were
you doing down there?
I opened the door.
He opened the door'
and fell down the stairs.
Fibber.
How careless!
You should be careful! A person
can get killed that way!
I hope you weren't
disturbed, Dr. Lejos.
It's perfectly all right,
my dear. Introduce me.
This is Miss Raymond.
Mr. Young.
And this is Wilbur.
Ah, Wilbur! Why!
I heard so much about you, I
feel  if we have already met.
And I must say, my dear, I approve
very highly of your choice.
What we need today
is young blood.
And brains!
Oh, don't be bashful. Come.
Hello, Dr. Lejos. I've been
looking for you all clay.
You know, every time I ask Dr. Mornay what
that equipment is going to be used for,
she says to ask you.
Of course.
Didn't I hear that you were
going to masquerade ball?
Yes, we have our costumes out in the boat.
Oh, you young people!
Making the most
of life, while ii lasts.
Thank you.
Professor, you've
worked hard and well.
Why don't you join them, and save
your questions until tomorrow?
Under ordinary circumstances I'd
say no, but... If you don't mind?
Not at all.
Good. I'll get my coal.
Of course that would make
too many for one boat.
But if the professor and this lady
and gentleman go on ahead, sure.
Wilbur and Dr. Mornay can...
I'm afraid I can't.
What's the matter?
I've suddenly developed
a splitting headache.
I'm sorry, Wilbur, but you'll
have to go without me.
Nonsense! It will pass
as quickly as it came.
It's no use, Doctor. I shall
have to go directly to bed.
Pardon me. Well, Chick,
there goes your date.
Now then, what
was that all about?
This thing is too dangerous. The
girl is an insurance investigator.
Stevens is asking
too many questions.
And Wilbur was up to
something in the basement.
I think we ought to wait.
And jeopardize the success
of the operation? Never!
I must warn you, my dear Sandra,
I am accustomed
to having my orders obeyed,
especially by women
with a price on their heads.
Don't try to scare me,
Count Dracula.
Hem. The Secrets m' Lite
and Death by Dr. Frankenstein.
Memorize them. Operate yourself,
if you're in such a hurry.
I have other ways
of securing your cooperation.
You're wasting your time. My
will is as strong as yours.
Are you sure?
Look into my eyes.
Look!
Deepen
Tell me what you see.
Joan, Chick and I are gonna go into the
lockers and change into our costumes.
Come on, Professor. We'll
meet you on the dance floor.
What did I do?
What do you mean?
He's dancing with my girl!
So what?
I'll show her!
I'm in love...
Okay. Come on. Pick
up those bundles!
Let's get dressed.
Come on.
So, it's you!
Ah, he knows me!
McDougal! Listen, fat boy,
where are my exhibits?
Now, you leave him alone!
Not until he tells me
where those exhibits are.
Where are they?
Where are they?
McDougal, now
we've got it on you.
You put us in jail. Now, we'll have
you arrested for assault and battery.
Go ahead and see what good it'll do ya.
You haven't got a witness.
I'm a witness! My word's
as good as yours!
Your word is better than his.
You keep outta this.
I'll get a witness. Do me
a favor, will you, fella?
Will you watch this?
I need a witness.
Go ahead. I'd like to
see you do it again.
Did you see it?
I'm sorry.
I couldn't see a thing.
Thank you.
Have you seen Chick
Young or Wilbur Grey?
Seen them? I don't
even know them.
I've got to know what
they found on that island.
Chick! Wilbur!
What did you find?
Was I right?
No.
And I wish you'd stop trying to put
those ideas in this boy's head.
He's not used to them. Go
put your things on, Wilbur.
Did you meet Dr. Lejos?
Yes.
What did he look like? Tall,
aristocratic, a faraway look in his eye?
All I know is he told us to
go out and have some fun.
Why don't you?
Can't I convince you that Dracula
is a very dangerous person?
You and Wilbur are just trying to scare me.
Well, it won't work!
I scared ya.
I scared ya, you big sissy.
This is your mask over there.
Mine?
Oh, no, no. Please don't wear that.
What's the matter?
I know you'll think
I'm crazy, but...
In a half an hour the moon will
rise and I'll turn into a wolf.
You and 20 million other guys.
Listen!
I might tear you limb from limb!
Is that serious?
He'll murder ya!
That's serious.
It won't be if you'll just take
me and lock me in my room.
Please.
Oh, all right.
Why don't you hire
yourself a keeper?
Come on.
Hey!
Look.
Oh, Sandra's coming.
Is it all clear? I will
take care of the girl.
And you'll take Wilbur
back to the castle.
Understand?
Yes, Master.
Sandra, you look...
So... We meet again,
Count Dracula.
Dracula? Yes. That's
who he says you are.
Oh, my costume perhaps. No, Talbot
here thinks you're the real thing.
Uh-huh. Right out of
McDougal's House of Horrors.
What an odd hallucination.
But the human mind is often
inflamed with strange complexes.
I suggest you consult
your physician, Mr. Talbot.
And take him along
with you, please.
Well, so there you are!
I'm glad to see
you've recovered.
I didn't expect to see you here, Doctor.
Sandra insisted I come.
Besides, I need
a little relaxation.
Miss Raymond, would you
honor me with a dance?
No. No!
I warn you.
He is Count Dracula!
How interesting.
Tell me more.
No, let me tell you...
While we dance.
Pardon me, Mr. Talbot.
Sandra, do you feel all right'?
Of course.
But I must obey
my doctor's orders.
Oh, sure! You gotta do
what the doctor tells ya.
I intend to. Let's
have a walk, Wilbur.
Toodle-oo.
Professor, do you
understand women?
I don't even m'.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Sit here.
Sandra, there's something strange about ya.
You're not yourself.
Is there anything
I can do to help'?
I want you to go away
with me to the island.
Just me and you'?
Yes.
I want to be the only one in your life.
I want to be part of you.
I want to be in your blood.
I think I know what you mean.
Wouldn't you want a prettier fellow
than me? No. I want no one but you.
You are so full-blooded,
so round, so firm.
So fully packed.
And I want to stay that way.
Stuck myself.
I'm bleedin'.
Let me see it.
Uh-uh.
There ain't enough there for the two
of us, if that's what you're thinking.
I'll tell you what I'm thinking.
Look into my eyes.
I'm afraid to. There's
nothing to be afraid of.
Look. Deeper.
Deeper!
Deepen
I looked deep enough.
I don't wanna look anymore.
Of course you do.
Don't you know
what's going to happen now?
I'll bite.
Oh, no... I will!
CHICK: Wilbur!
Joan! Wilbur!
Joan?
There he is.
Wilbur, have you seen Joan?
No, bull have definitely
made up my mind.
You can have Sandra, but make sure
you've got plenty of bandages.
Maybe Dracula lured Joan
into the woods and...
Chick, do "you know what could happen
if I meet Dracula in the woods?
I'll bite. Oh, no. You
gotta stand in line.
Let's not waste anytime.
Yeah, let's.
Joan? Joan?
Joan! Chick,
we can't find her.
Now, let's keep on looking.
Come on. Joan!
Joan?
Chick, we're never
gonna find her.
Joan!
WILBUR; Joan?
Joan?
Joan?
Joan!
Joan!
Chick? Chick?
Where did he go? Chick!
I'm gettin' tired of
lookin' for Joan.
Look at him.
Didn't Mr. Talbot tell you not
to put that mask on anymore?
Now, what'd you put it on for?
Now, take the mask off!
Come on!
Joan?
Hey, Chick, now, what are
you lookin' in there for?
You know you're not
gonna find Joan there.
Now, come on, get up!
Get up! We gotta find Joan.
Come on, Chick.
Now, take that mask off!
Take it easy.
I'm your friend!
MAN: Help! Help!
Help!
The man's been hurt. Looks
like something attacked him.
Get a doctor.
You'll be all right, though another
half inch would have severed
your jugular vein.
Get him up.
Who did it? It was
somebody in a wolf's mask.
McDougal, what happened to you?
You! It was you! He said
he was gonna get me.
Me?
That's right.
I saw him arguing with you
earlier this evening.
That's ridiculous.
Why, I wouldn't...
People, real live people.
That's a boy. Tell 'em.
You, Chick.
What's the matter?
What's the idea of trying
to take a bite out of me?
What was the idea?
Now, you.
What, did he take
a bite out of you too?
What's the matter
with you, Chick?
You gone mad or something?
Wilbur!
Don't let that little
fellow fool you.
He's an accomplice.
Me?
Let's call the sheriff.
I'll go call him.
Wait a minute...
Chick! Chick! Oh, Chick!
Chick!
Count Dracula wants me...
Joan, Joan, come on.
We gotta get outta here.
Joan?
Joan? Don't tell me
you've gone bats too.
Wilbur! Wilbur! Wilbur!
Chick! Chick!
Chick, Chick.
Quiet. They're after me.
After you? What for?
McDougal was almost killed
last night by either a wolf
or a man wearing
a mask of a wolf!
It was a wolf.
I'm going to give myself up.
It's the only way to clear you.
Then, you were on the level
about that wolf business?
Yes. I'm going to surrender. Wait a minute.
You can't do that!
Dracula's taken Wilbur
and Joan to the island.
Are you sure of that? I saw
what I saw when I saw it!
Hurry! Follow me!
They may come back.
But Dracula?
Dracula is helpless until after nightfall.
Maybe by then we'll...
Okay. But after what I saw
there'd better not be any maybe.
Sandra. Sandra?
Sandra!
Junior?
Junior?
Junior.
Will you help me get outta here?
Sandra! Junior.
Sandra! Junior.
Shall we begin?
I've been waiting, Master.
Sandra? Sandra?
He's growing weaker!
Will he respond
to the operation?
If the generators
are kept going.
Then, we must start immediately.
I'll get rid of Stevens,
and you take care of him.
Sandra, what are you gonna do?
Don't worry. I'm not going to hurt you.
Thank you.
Soon, instead of being
short and chubby,
you'll be big and tall
and  strong as an ox.
And furthermore, you'll live
forever and never grow old.
Oh, Sandra.
You still love me.
But, Sandra, how are
you gonna do all these things?
By a simple operation.
I shall remove your brain
and put it in his body.
You're gonna take my brain
and put it in Junior's body?
Yes.
For a minute, I didn't know
how you were gonna do it?
Good evening, Professor.
Is everything under control?
Everything but my temper.
I found Miss Raymond
in Dr. Mornay's room.
You should mind your own
business, Professor.
I also found this, which
is very much my business.
And after I've taken Joan back
to town, I'm gonna help...
Excellent
Let's take him to the cellar.
We can dispose of all the
bodies at the same time.
Well, there's the boat all right.
Let's look around.
That must be the
entrance to the castle.
Come on.
Come.
Lie down. Here.
Yes, Master.
Frankie, don't let
'em do it to ya.
Frankie boy.
Listen to me, Frankie.
Don't let 'em do it to ya!
Frankie. Frankie! I'm tellin'
ya, it's a bad deal.
I've had this brain for 30 years
and it hasn't worked right yet.
Ask me how much one and one is, Frankie.
Go ahead, ask me.
I don't know.
SANDRA: We'll be
right back, Wilbur.
Okay. I'll wait.
Chick!
Wilbur!
Dracula is Dracula!
And Sandra's gonna use my brain to make
a bigger dummy out of the other dummy.
Wait, I'll get you out of this.
No kiddin'!
Wait a minute.
Hurry up.
All right. Attaboy.
Does it hurt? No, no. Go
ahead, a little harder.
Something wrong here...
What's the matter? All right,
I'm doing the best I can!
Wait a minute. Oh,
pardon me, I'm sorry.
There you are. Now, get outta here.
Go ahead.
Hey, not that way.
To the left!
Get him out.
Get him out! Attaboy.
No door. No door? Come
on, get outta here!
Come on.
Hey.
Now, take it easy,
you'll be all right.
We gotta get back to the castle.
Joan's in there. Come on.
Come on, Wilbur. Not me. Not me,
I'm not goin' back in there.
I've got too much
of what they want, brains.
All right. Get the motor
started in the boat.
Hurry up.
Okay.
They've escaped!
You attend to the Monster. I can
handle our fat friend. Come.
Wilbur.
Come back.
Come.
I said, come back!
Come!
Wilbur! We're all set, Wilbur.
You got the boat...
Wilbur! We're all set, Wilbur.
You got the boat...
Wilbur!
He's not here!
Now where's! he go?
Look!
They started the operation.
They must've found him.
We've gotta go back.
You stay here with Joan.
Please, give me a little ether.
We don't need it.
You won't feel a thing.
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you!
Get me off here.
What are you lookin' out the window for?
Somebody else comin' after me?
Hey! Will you...
Chick, help! Please!
Chick!
Chick! Chick! Oh, Chick!
Chick!
Chick!
Back.
Back!
Chick! Come on!
Chick, do you believe me now?
YES.
Hurry up.
Let's barricade the door.
Okay.
Come on, get it over
there. Get in there.
Okay, come on.
There.
Come on. Put your shoulder to the door.
Hold it tight.
We barricaded it.
He can't get in here!
Come on, Wilbur!
Come on!
Back.
Back.
Back.
Yes, Master.
He thinks I'm Dracula.
Well, we got him!
Joan! Joan!
Are you all right?
McDougal.
I gotcha.
You're just the one we're lookin' for.
You still want your exhibits?
Of course I do. Well, here
comes one of 'em now!
Chick!
Come on, Wilbur!
Fill that bucket with gas.
Untie the boat.
Untie the boat!
Untie the boat, will ya?
Untie the boat, will ya please?
Okay!
Well, he won't chase us anymore.
And thing, Mr. Chick Young.
The next time that I tell you that
I saw something when I saw it,
you'll believe me that I saw it!
Oh, relax.
Now that we've seen the last of
Dracula, the Wolfman and the Monster,
there's nobody to
frighten us anymore.
That's too bad. I was
hoping to get in on the excitement.
that?
