Davie!
Pick up your bags.
Step off!
Move on.
Fucking shit-hole!
No talking, I said!
Lindsay, you should
stop pumping up.
No, I've got
a 20-pack, look.
Oh, Lindsay,
Lindsay! Aaah!
Get off me,
get off me!
Morning, girls.
I want you to say hello
to your new roomie,
Callum.
Pick a bed.
Any bed, son.
Now you play nice.
You skinny boy.
Yeah, man.
A real bad boy.
Not there.
Or there.
Well, it looks like
you're on the floor, mate.
It's real nice
down there, man.
Bullseye!
What do you reckon, boys?
Lindsay's turn now?
No, Steve, no.
Yeah, I reckon
half an hour, man.
Please, just--
just leave me alone.
-
- Lewis?
I done it yesterday,
how come I have
to do it again?
Talk to him.
Come on.
No, just--just not--
not--not today.
No! No!
Get up!
Help me!
shut up!
You get in there,
you faggot man!
Communication...
By that I just don't
mean communicating
with each other.
I mean communication
with your inner self.
In this room
you can express yourself
in a safe environment.
so...
Lewis.
This is your chance.
Externalize your anger.
Understand it,
and you control it.
I'm not angry.
Fuck's sake!
Callum,
would you like
to share your anger?
Look, I know this
can be a little bit
intimidating at the start,
but once you get over
the first hurdle,
you'll realize--
Anger.
Shut up, man.
Oi, Lindsay. Looking
for Davie, batty man?
Batty boy!
No! Get away!
Davie, it's me, man,
let me in, Steve's coming!
Oi! Where are they?!
Who's that then, Steve?
You know who.
I don't know what
you're talking about, steve.
Steve, leave him!
We all get in shit
if you cause trouble,
so forget about it.
speak!
Perfect!
Two little cocksucking
rat bastards together.
How funny is it now?
Not funny at all, steve.
steve, don't.
Please.
Just leave us alone.
I don't know about you,
Lewis,
but I feel like
taking a piss.
I thought we were
gonna do this...
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm really
bursting.
No, don't!
No!
No you don't.
Why can't you just
be a man about it,
eh, Davie?
Take what's coming
to you.
You're such
a little faggot.
I bet you're slipping it
to your little chum here,
right?
Now, boys...
Now...
Drink up!
Warden!
Warden!
You know they're
gonna blame us
for this, innit?
shit always rolls
downhill, man.
Trust me here.
They're coming
our way, you know.
Fresh
and steaming.
Who'd notice
on you, Jethro?
What the fuck
are you saying,
steve?
You've got to learn
to take a joke, mate.
You brothers
are so sensitive.
One of these days,
I'm gonna beat the shit--
What?
Come on, then.
Right! By your beds.
Governor's here.
Jethro, put that down.
You can't even
fucking read!
sir!
Er...This was
his dorm.
Which was his?
That bed there,
sir.
You.
Now!
Did any of you
know him?
Why didn't you try
to help him or stop him?
We were sleeping.
We didn't know.
That he was dying
right beside you all?
What's your name?
Lindsay, sir.
I know what
all of you did.
And so should you!
Get them out of here.
Get them to the island.
And teach then
a bloody lesson!
Yes, sir.
Fucking brilliant.
Do you reckon
we can get some
pizza delivered?
steve, give me
that phone.
Joking, man.
Right, guys. Get your kit,
let's get moving.
Tragic, man,
tragic.
Keep up, Callum!
Come on, Callum!
I don't see why
we can't just camp here.
You seen the size
of that hill?
Does anyone
even live here?
No, not anymore.
It was a training
station for the Army
before being handed over
to the prison service
for the likes of you lot.
Are you missing the concrete
beneath your feet, bro?
Well, you know me, bro.
It's all about street lamps,
pollution, fast food, and
Dixie fried chicken,
you get me?
All that shit.
straight up, Blue.
Deep-pan pizza.
Oh, yeah, KFC.
shut up, man.
Just walk, man.
What the fuck
are we doing here?
Building character, lads.
Character.
Uninhabited...right?
There's a tree.
There's another one.
Do these things bite?
I don't think so, no.
Oh, look, man,
another tree.
Well. Here
we are, lads.
Home, sweet home.
This is a joke, right?
This is where
we're supposed to stay?
Fucking hell.
This is dead, man.
Four tents.
One for me,
one for the kits,
and you can fight over
the others yourselves.
Callum!
Yeah, there's some
over there, mate.
-  Where?
-  There.
Where? I can't see
where your finger's pointing.
There!
Oh, you're fucking
useless, mate.
Little flying
bastards.
Look at this shit.
I've been bitten
all over, man.
I thought you'd like
this jungle life, Jethro.
Make you feel
right at home.
You're a
flipping comedian,
you know that.
Fucking clown!
That's enough.
Who wants a lovely
morning, steaming
cup of tea?
Yeah, nice one, Jed.
Yeah? I'll tell you what.
Callum, go and
fill these up
from the river, 200 meters
straight down there, son.
All right?
And get a move on!
Somebody wake
Lindsay up.
Where's my bloody water?
Jed, he's over here!
Oh, you'll live.
What happened?
I got hit.
Hit?
someone hit you?
No, Blue, he just
fell over, didn't you?
No, I got hit.
some joker smacked me
from behind.
Was it you?
It was us that
found you.
Calm down,
killer.
Where's your sense
of team spirit, eh?
Are we safe with him
here being with us?
steve, I think we're
gonna be alright
with lover boy Lewis
here to protect you.
Whoo!
No--no--no--
I don't really
like water, man.
Come on!
Come on, man!
Quiet, man.
shit.
Come on, man.
That's it, man.
You're nearly there!
It's not far!
Even fucking
Lindsay's done it!
Come on, man.
Cross to the other bank.
That's all.
Come on!
That's it, Blue.
Aaaah!
That's what I'm
talking about, man!
Whoo! Yeah!
I swear, I'm the only one
getting bitten or something.
Just relax.
Boys, boys!
Hang on a minute,
I'm just gonna have a waz.
Wait for me, innit, wait!
Whoa.
What the fuck
is that?
Is that
a camp site?
Boys!
Hello?
You said there was
no one else here.
There bloody well
shouldn't be.
You sit down,
shut up,
don't touch anything.
Look at all this.
They got a proper camp.
Jeth, see if there's
any money in there.
Oi. Who are you?
This island's private property.
There's no access
to the general public.
I'm not general public.
so I'll ask you again,
who are you?
Jed Wyler.
Moorgate's
Young Offenders.
Who the fuck
are you?
Luise Dow,
Temple Park.
I thought we had
the island to ourselves
for the week.
Yeah, so did l.
Found our stalker.
Jo?
Is this the little prick
that you saw?
Get off me!
Who the fuck
are these?
Blue, sit the fuck down,
I mean it.
Yeah. You all been
spying on us?
No one's been
fucking spying on you.
Fucking perverts.
Can I have a word?
Yeah.
Listen, I don't want your lads
anywhere near my girls.
They're enough
trouble already.
Well, I'm not exactly delighted
about the situation myself,
am l, Louise?
I got a couple
of drug dealers,
a violent sociopath,
an armed robber, a murderer,
and a serial sex offender.
Last thing I want
is your girls getting
all hot and riled
up under the collar,
do you get me?
Fine, we'll keep 'em
totally separate.
Good. Then,
why don't you
pack up your nice,
shiny tents and piss off
back to the mainland?
It's not gonna happen.
Right, well.
I'll take the, um,
north side of the river,
you take the south side.
Fine.
But I think you mean
east and west.
North's that way.
Right. On your feet,
lads, we're moving out.
Come on, chop-chop.
see you later,
babe, yeah?
Wanker.
so what's your name?
Jo.
And you?
Lewis.
Lewis.
Bye, Jo.
Bye, Lewis.
Are you done?
stay on your side
of the river, right?
Yeah, yeah.
You are such
a little slut.
Go fuck yourself.
Right, here we go,
boys, munchies.
More importantly,
jobs.
steve, Lew.
There's a monastery
on our side of the river.
I want you to find it.
It's actually
on the map.
Blue and Jethro,
I want you to find
some high ground
in case the weather
changes.
And Callum
and Lindsay,
there's a natural harbor
on our side of the river.
Find it.
Wait for me!
Piss off!
But Jed said
you and me!
I didn't!
I thought
you were different.
Well, I'm not! I'm just
like all the others,
so fuck off!
So you wanna
cross the river?
You heard
what Jed said, man.
But there's girls there,
man, what's wrong
with you?
Girls that are a little
too white for me.
I don't care about
their color, blood.
I just care
about their gash,
you get me?
To be honest, bro,
I don't think you really
stand a chance, man.
I mean, look at
that chick back at camp,
what's-her-name, Jo.
she's only making
eyes for Lewis.
Yeah, but why,
Jethro.
I mean, I reckon
I'm quite buff.
Buff?
You see them girls?
They like the big mans
like me, man.
I'm big man!
Trust me,
I'm big.
Where it counts.
Look, it's not
worth it, man.
I say we just kick back
and chill here, innit?
Take in some
of that fresh air,
Blue.
Oi, oi.
Well, I'm not one
to blow me own trumpet,
but well done, me.
I've got the map.
Yeah, I know,
but that's the point.
I didn't need the map.
You did.
who the fuck
is this guy?
Looks like someone
left a monk behind.
Are you alright,
Father?
What, did they
forget about you, eh?
Eh?
Come, Lewis!
Eh?
Fuck him.
Now, that's not
very holy, is it,
Father?
Lew.
Take that stick
away from me, man.
seriously, Blue,
why have you got
a stick?
'Cause I want
a stick, innit?
shut your mouth, man.
Afternoon, lads.
Get lost?
Never even tried.
What's the point?
It's good for you, innit,
do something new.
It's good for the soul.
You'll thank me for it
one day.
Don't count on it,
Jed.
Fair enough.
You alright, mate?
Jesus, fuck.
We need to
get out of here.
Come on,
let's get Louise.
What are you doing?
Come on,
let's get Louise.
Callum.
Up you get,
son.
I know what this vibe
looks like, but I swear--
Get the fucking cunt
off me!
Don't--
-  stay down!
-  Don't struggle!
A tramp
lived here?
Yeah.
For an uninhabited island,
it's getting pretty
fucking crowded, innit?
You seriously do not
think I did this.
You sent them two boys
down here to find
the place, not me!
But we never found it,
did we, Lew?
No, we got lost.
Yeah, I fucking
know you.
You don't know
nothing.
There's something
not right about this.
Yeah, too fucking
right it's not.
I think they look
like bite marks.
Right.
Well, this trip is well
and truly over.
Got a phone?
Yeah.
00:27:06,281
Use it,
call the mainland.
Phone's gone.
Maybe we should let
the Police decide
who's guilty.
Maybe you should stop
undermining my authority,
Louise.
How much experience
have you actually had
with special Unit
Youth Prisoners?
Me--ten years.
Well, not much,
to be honest.
I served in Bosra
with the 7th Armoured
Brigade
because I joined
the prison service.
so the inmates
I'm more used to
are your Republican Guard,
Fedayin, Taliban types.
so, yeah,
you're right.
I've not had much
special Unit Youth
experience,
but it was all they had.
How much experience
have you had
with dead bodies
and how they got that way?
Right,
who's the joker?
Who's got my phone?
I'm being serious.
Which one of you slags
has taken my fucking phone?!
We ain't got your phone,
man. If we had your phone
we'd give it back.
Just to get out
of this shitty place.
I need my phone.
You fucking know,
don't you, son?
I ain't fucking got it,
right?!
And even if I did--
You ain't got the stones
to take it off me,
have you?
You done
a head count recently?
There's more of us
than you.
Ngh! Ah!
simple question!
Have you got the phone,
yes or no?!
No. No,
fucking no.
You need to keep
a lid on this situation.
Right, everyone,
listen up.
Considering everything's
happened today,
Louise and the girls
are going to stay
here with us tonight.
No dicking around,
I mean it!
so, what's the plan
of action, then.
Are we leaving?
No.
Tomorrow we'll go
and find the tramp's boat.
Take it to the mainland
and get some help.
so get some
food on, eh.
The super-noodles
are mine, innit?
I'm sick of beans.
so, are you
enjoying that?
It isn't bad.
Can you give me the keys
to Callum's cuffs?
Why?
I just wanna give him
some food.
Unless you want to.
Louise, don't be
mugged off by Callum.
Don't be fooled by him.
The thing about that kid,
you never know which way
he's gonna fly.
He's got a list
of previous as long
as my arm.
I'll tell you something.
You know when
he was 14,
he even killed another boy.
I know, I was there.
Oh, he got away
without charge.
Maybe he shouldn't
have done.
I don't know
what he's capable of.
still want the keys?
You're taking
a bit of a risk,
aren't ya?
I'm a stone-cold
killer, remember?
I don't think so.
You don't think
I did it, then?
I don't think
you could do
anything to me.
Can I smoke
a cigarette?
Did you kill that lad
back in the other
institution?
What?
Jed's told you
his favorite story,
then?
Well, did you?
He died.
You see that?
This lad, Neeson,
stuck his craft
knife in me.
I defended myself,
that's all.
He stabbed me, but...
No way I wanted
to kill him.
Why would I want
to kill him?
You know,
I don't want to spend
all my life inside.
These boys,
they don't give a shit.
They love it.
They're never getting out.
But me,
I'm using this.
I've got a plan.
You got a plan, eh?
Yeah, I have.
I keep my head down,
and I do this quietly.
'Cos when I get out,
there's no foster care,
no more care at all.
Out of the system.
It's just Callum.
And I can have one day
without doors slamming,
without shouting,
just silence
to think.
ssshhh!
ssshh, what's that?
It's me, it's me.
ssshh!
Oh! Oh!
Yo, Blue,
come on, man,
wake up.
Blue, wake up,
it's water duty.
Well, it don't take
two of us, man.
Yeah, but Jed said
not to go out
alone, innit?
You're gonna need
a crowbar and a winch
to get me out of here,
'cause I ain't moving,
alright?
You're so flipping
useless, you, man.
Don't even know why
I hang around with you
in the first place.
Hello, there!
Oh, fuck!
¢Ý Yeah, yeah ¢Ý
So you let him go out
alone? You, you plank.
How many times have
I got to tell you things
before you actually listen?
He's gonna be fine.
I mean, what's
gonna happen to him?
Well, I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.
You are gonna go
and find him.
Alright, let me
get this straight, yeah.
so you want me to go
out there alone
to find another guy
out there alone
when no one's supposed
to be going out there alone.
Yeah, that really
makes sense, Jed.
Yeah, well.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you take
your best mate
shitty pants with you?
Yeah. Take Lindsay
for your protection,
Blue.
No, I'd rather
go out alone.
Right, don't talk to me,
don't walk near me,
just walk behind me.
Understand?
What are you doing, man?
That's enough close.
I said don't walk
next to me, innit?
Well, how far?
That far?
That far!
stay away from me, innit?
Fucking dickhead, man.
shit, it's always me,
innit!
Jethro!
Jethro, man!
He's not here,
is he?
Well, he was here,
look.
Look, man,
just keep looking,
innit.
Jethro, man!
Come on, cuz,
where are you?
Come on, cuz!
Jethro!
Look.
Why'd you think
he'd run off?
Do you think
something bad's
happened to him?
something bad?
Oh, you'd like
that, innit?
Er, a little bit of action, eh?
You never did like Jethro.
We'll make a move
when the lads get back.
He's dead!
Quickly!
He's fucking dead, man!
He's dead!
His arm,
we found his arm!
Floating down the river!
His arm torn off!
Calm down, Blue.
What happened?
There's something else
on this island, and it tore
Jethro to pieces!
You saw him?
-
- And you're sure he's dead?
Blue, are you
dicking me around?
Everybody calm down!
Stay here!
Louise, you--
Everybody get down!
Hide behind something!
Move!
Come on!
Argh!
Aaaah!
Callum, what can you see?
I can't see anybody!
I've been shot
by a fucking arrow.
Aaaah!
Fuck!
Come here, help me!
Get it out!
Where are
the keys?!
Jed! Where are
the keys?!
I can't help
with my hands cuffed!
-  Go, go.
-  No!
Go now!
Take this!
I'm gonna try
and draw them off.
Come on.
Run, run, run...
Alright! Over here!
Hey!!!
-
-
Go, go, go!
Aaaahhh!
Oh, Christ!!!
No, leave him,
go!
Aaah!
Fuck.
I'm gonna
head them off.
- We've gotta stay to--
- Just do it!
Argh!
Louise!
Oh!
You alright?
Yeah.
Fucking unbelievable,
right?
What was that, man?
I mean, what's happening?
Did you see anyone?
Did you see that guy
with the crossbow?
No! shut up!
Fuck me!
Couldn't have happened
to a nicer prick.
Where's everyone
else?
Where's Louise?
Why did someone
do this to us?
I mean,
what have we done?
Maybe they were mates
with that tramp.
Maybe. But we didn't
kill him, did we?
Well, wasn't this one of
them old army places?
Maybe--maybe them
dogs were just left here
and--
Yeah, and I suppose
they left a guy with
a crossbow, too, right?
Listen, I don't care.
I just wanna get out
of here, okay?
How are we gonna get out?
There's no way off
this fucking island
without a boat.
Killer made it then.
Have you seen Louise?
Do you know
where she is?
she died.
she took one of the dogs
over the cliff with her.
Where are
you going?
stop!
Please!
Why would I wait here?
He knows where we are.
No, no, maybe
he don't wanna kill us.
I mean, maybe
he just wanted Jed.
I mean, it's
a possibility, innit?
A pissed off former
inmate or something.
Listen.
We need
to stick together.
And we need
to help each other.
Why would l
help you?
Fuck him.
Let him go.
Who gives a shit?
Yo, Steve.
He's got a knife, man.
Yeah. Well, leave
the knife, there's a good boy.
You're joking,
aren't you?
- No.
-
Leave it.
Take it.
Give us the knife.
I will fucking gut you,
kidder.
Okay, alright.
Alright.
He's right,
we can't stay here.
Mandy, those
army huts, remember?
-
-  Across the river.
The other side
of the island.
Let's get our shit together
and get out of here!
Oi!
Come on!
Wait up, man.
shut up!
- Oi.
-
Are they gone yet?
Come on.
Go!
steve.
What?
Nothing.
Then fuck off.
How come
he's in charge now?
He's got the knife,
he's the man.
Yeah, but surely
you could take
that off him, innit?
Yeah,
If I wanted to.
But I don't want to.
Not yet.
Why not? I mean,
are you scared?
shut the f--
Okay. I reckon
there's only three
dogs left.
There's seven of us,
so even if they come fast
they can't get us
if we're holding these.
Maybe they won't
come back.
Oh, they'll be back.
I know it.
Just shut up!
Are we going
in the right direction?
Yeah, this is the way.
This is the way,
I remember.
Fuck!
My God,
that's sick!
It's so sick.
This is so fucked up.
What's the matter,
Lewis?
You're not feeling...
rehabilitated yet?
He's following us.
He's watching us now.
What do we do,
Steve?
Get the fuck
out of here.
Fuck you!!!
This is good,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah, this is good.
You first, killer.
What is this place?
This is good.
So we're gonna
be safe here, yeah?
Yeah.
I've never seen
a dead body before.
I have.
What--what did
that "D" mean, man?
Do you reckon it was
his name or something?
He's not fucking Zorro,
is he?
Maybe it was
"D" for "dead"?
Then his name
should be
"The bloody
obvious killer. "
Maybe it's
someone else's name.
Like who?
David, Donald,
Derek...
Dickhead.
Davie.
Oh, shit!
Davie.
Davie.
Who's Davie?
It's Davie's dad
out there.
No--no way,
no fucking way, man!
Yeah! He's come
to get us, cos of
what you did to him!
shut your
fucking mouth!
We didn't kill him,
did we?
He topped himself,
remember?
Yeah, why, though?
Because of you!
You know something,
don't ya?
Talk,
you little shit!
What do you know?!
Nothing!
You tell me what
you know or I will
slice your fucking throat.
What do you know
about Davie's dad?
He was scared of him.
He loved him, like,
but he said--he said
he was just crazy.
He was--
he was--
He was a soldier
or something.
That's it, a soldier.
And that is all I know.
I swear.
You know more,
you lying little fucker!
I don't know--
He was--he was--
special Forces
or something!
I don't know!
Special Forces?
Yeah...
He's gonna
kill us, steve.
What are we
gonna do if this
guy's a real soldier?
Shut up, Lewis.
What about
the dogs?
Fuck the dogs,
is that it?
All I know.
I swear to you now,
that's all I know.
We're so fucked.
No, Jo.
No, we're not.
This has nothing
to do with us.
It's not us
he wants.
It's just those
little shits.
Why don't you go
and tell him that, eh?
And tell him
that I never done
nothing either.
He's not gonna let
anyone off the island
now, is he?
But we didn't
do anything.
If he's letting us
know who he is--
that means none
of us are getting
out of here alive.
Fuck off.
Hey.
What do you want?
I just wanted
to make sure
you was alright.
I mean, you shouldn't
really be out here
by yourself, should you?
Yeah, I'm fine,
thanks.

of what Lewis
is getting.
Fuck off.
Who do you think
you're talking to, eh?
Eh?
You shut your mouth!
If you scream,
I will fucking

I will kill you.
They'll just think
it was the hunter anyway.
Don't worry, darling,

We have to help him.
Let him fucking bleed.
Does it hurt, mate?

Mandy,

I can't do it!
I don't wanna die!
Callum!
I can't hold...
Help me

Don't you dare!
He's falling!

Guys! The dogs are here!
Quick, quick, hurry up!
I can't hold him.
Blue! I can't

Lew, give us a hand!
Another one!
Open the door!
We've gotta get out of here!
I can't open the door!
Move out of the way!
Aaaah!
Fuck!
Steve! Steve!

Move, Lewis!
Aaah! Guys, wait there!
Wait for me!
Please!
I think I've hurt
myself, hang on!
I've seen this
in the movies.
so they can't catch
the scent, right?
Yeah, that's it.
We cross at one point,
come out at another.
Then they can't
catch us, yeah.
-
-  Oh! Are you alright?
Yeah, thanks.
What are
you like, Lewis?
He's being a
nice guy, alright?
You wouldn't know
about that.
slap her
for me, Lewis.
You're a twat.
Oh, watch yourself.
so, what did you do
to that boy, anyway?
Nothing.
He killed himself.
Yeah, but why?
I don't know.
Oi! Wait!
Wait!
Oi, wait!
Who is that guy?
Get down.
Eh? What?
He's in there.
I saw him moving.
Let's get out
of here.
No! We've got
the edge on him.
He doesn't know we're here.
Louise.
Louise!
Get some wood!
We need to start a fire,
keep her warm.
Jesus Christ!
Louise!
Lie her down gently.
Louise.
Louise, can you
hear me?
You have to get off
the island.
No shit, sherlock.
Shut up, Steve.
Get the boat.
I've seen, it's not far.
Not far.
Hang in there.
so we find
this boat, then, yeah?
Where is it?
We're gonna have
to look for it,
aren't we, dummy?
Don't call me a dummy.
stop acting like one!
All you do is follow him around
and do what he says,
like some little lap dog.
If you want a punch--
We gotta find
a way down to the shore
and find that boat.
But--but what
about Louise?
We find her somewhere
comfortable and dry.
We'll come back
when we find the boat.
We're gonna have
to split up and
look for this boat.
That's gonna take
fucking forever.
so you found
something else to do?
Don't be
a smart-arse, slut.
Let's go.
Come on, Lew.
Oh, I'm not just gorgeous,
I'm lucky, too.
Nice.
This his boat?
Doubt it. Probably
that old tramp's.
still, good
enough for me.
I'll go and call
the others.
What for?
What, you ain't
gonna tell them?
Why would I want
to do that for?
There's not one here
I give a shit about.
Come on,
help me shift it.
But Jo?
Fuck Jo!
Oh, yeah, sorry,
I forgot you already have.
But I don't wanna
leave her, steve.
Then stay here.
I don't give a hit
what you do, Lewis.
I'm going.
Oh, fuck it.
Come on.
Hey!
Oi! Oi!
Come on!
No!
Quickly.
What?
What is it?
He's cut
the fuel line.
He knows we're here.
Fuck!
Aaah! Aaah!
God!
Oh, God!
Oh! Oh!!!
Jesus!
Fuck!
Fuck! The dogs!
Fuck!
The sea...
Let's just...
run into the sea!
I can't swim.
- Jo!
- No!
You can swim
faster than a dog.
No, no!
Come on,
into the water.
Come on!
Come on!
steve. steve.
Dogs, dogs.
We can take it.
Oh, fuck it!
Run!
Get a fucking grip!
Okay? I wanna

Do you understand?
Okay.
Oh, fuck,

Lindsay! Lindsay,
mate, well done,

You left me,

No! No, no, no.
We wouldn't have left ya.
You must've got lost
or something.
Look, listen.
Throw some rocks
at this dog, will ya?
Lindsay!
You fucker,
I'm gonna do for ya!
Those fucking dogs!
We're trapped
out here.
That dog's fucked off.
You little bastard!
Come here!
Get a fucking grip!
We could swim
to a safer place.
Mandy...
And we can get out.
I can't,
I'm so fucking...
You're gonna
leave us, eh?!
Not so fucking

Steve! Steve!
In here!
Yeah, Lew!
Let me in!
sorry, mate,
not enough room.
Actually...
Come here.
Ah! Ah!
Get off me!
No! steve,
the dog's coming.
It's on its way!
steve, let go!
You're doing
really well, Linds.
One's gone.
Callum,
one's gone!
Callum!
Callum! No!
Yaaargh!
Come on,
you fucking bitch!
Ah, you fucking--
Aaah!
Oh, God!
Aaah!
Jesus...
Where's she gone?
But Louise couldn't
have walked away.
Get off me.
Let go of me!
shut up!
You're gonna die.
Yeah? Well, you're
coming with me, fucko.
God, I'm hungry.
Yeah.
I could eat just
about any fucking thing.
Me, too.
Where are you going?
You said
you were hungry.
He could be
out there.
I know he's out there.
Jo.
Come here.
Piss off.
What's the matter?
You were gonna
leave me here.
No, we were
going for help.
The--the boat
wasn't big enough
and--
steve told me to.
shhh.
I can hear something.
What?
What is it?
There's
something there.
something there,
in the trees.
Well, you said
you were hungry.
Louise.
Holy shit.
Cut his fucking
head off.
Maybe it's
the best bit?
You're not serious.
You never heard
of chow mein?
That's dog,
that is.
Killer's lost it.
Maybe he's doing
the right thing.
Going out into
the woods and
getting your throat slit?
Very smart.
He's got some stones
on him, though.
steve, you got
that lighter?
Yeah.
Can I use it?
No.
a dick.
A what?
Look, I just wanna
get this fire going.
It is for all of us here.
Well, I want you
to come over
and suck my cock,
but that ain't gonna
happen either, is it?
Why are you being
like this?
Cos I can be.
Why are you
such a bitch?
Least I ain't
a coward.
I'm a what?
You're a fucking coward!
And you know you are.
The only reason
we're in this mess
is 'cause of you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'll give you
coward. Cunt!
Lewis, do something.
Now, what
did you say?
I said you're
a fucking coward!
stop him!
steve.
You pussy-whipped
twat, Lewis.
Don't you dare
fucking speak
to me.
Steve,
I said don't!
We've gotta
work together!
Tell you what, mate.
Why don't you come over
and try and stop me, eh?
Get the fucking--
Get off--
Oh!
You are
fucking dead!
You are gonna pray
for that crossbow,
because I'm
gonna do it slow.
I don't wanna
fight you, steve.
I'm not gonna fight you.
Oh!
Fuck, stupid fuck!
- Let it go, steve!
- Get the fuck off me!
Fuck off! Get off!
Fuck off!
Get off!
Please!
Alright. Alright,
fucking alright.
No more fighting?
Alright.
Now fuck off.
Where'd Mandy go?
she's run away!
Because of him.
You should have gone,
not her.
We don't need you here.
Lewis doesn't
need you here.
You're poison.
He's got me now.
He will do
what I want.
He's mine.
- He's yours?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Well, you can
fucking have him.
Lewis! No!!!
Help!!!
Help!!!
Oh.
Oh, steve,
thank God.
steve, cut me
down, please.
Please cut me
down, steve.
Do you smell that?
I know, it's petrol,
please, cut me down!
And this...
That's nasty,
innit?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about Lewis!
Aaah!
Don't you ever
say his name!
Ever!
It's your fault.
You killed him.
You made it happen.
I didn't mean to,
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to.
Please cut me down,
please.
Please.
Nah.
Help!
Don't fucking
leave me here!
I don't wanna die
like this, you motherfucker!
No, please, no.
Come back!
W--what
do you want?
You're gonna help me
get out of here.
Not good enough.
I brought him
for ya.
He was the one!
He was
the real bastard.
We never
touched him.
He fucking
killed himself!
You drove him
to it!
No one helped him.
No one's gonna
help you either.
I never fucking
touched him, alright?
Remind me.
What happened
to my son?
He cut his wrists.
slashed them open.
Bled to death.
Alright?!
Your turn.
I want you to feel
what my son felt.
I want you to feel
what my son felt!
You know your son
was a pussy, don't ya?
That's why
he killed himself.
No stones.
Well, that ain't me.
so go fuck yourself!
Argh!
Have you
killed them all?
Not yet.
Well, he was
the worst.
Go down to the boat
and wait for me there.
All this because
your boy got bullied?
Did you know
he was scared of you?
Yeah, ask Lindsay.
Your boy was
frightened of you.
You're just
another fucking father
with no idea about his kid.
Well, I ain't scared
of you or your pooches.
Go on, call your dogs.
'Cause you'll fucking
need them, mate.
You want a fair fight,
do you?
You think what happened
to my son was fair?
I don't give a shit
what happened to your son.
But I'll tell you
one thing,
you're gonna kill me.
And you're gonna
do it like a man.
One more thing.
I'm not here
for a fair fucking fight!
I'm sorry, motherfucker,
I meant to tear
your head off!
Aaah!
Aaaah!
Fuck!
Aaaah!
Ha!
shit!
You knew?
Knew?
I asked him to come.
I told him
we'd be here.
This...
was because of you?
Yeah.
I just told him
all of the things they
did to me and Davie,
those fucking bastards!
I knew he'd come.
I knew he'd come
and I knew he'd
hunt 'em down.
What about me?
And Louise?!
You fucking
murdering bastard!
Aaah!!!
Aaaahhh!
Argh.
Ah!
Where are
the others?
What do we
do now?
I'm not staying here
just to get sent back.
What?
I died on this island.
We all died.
You're not feeling
rehabilitated, yet?
