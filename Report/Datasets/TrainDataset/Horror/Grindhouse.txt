They called him Machete.
$70 a day for yard work.
Get in.
Sewage.
Have you ever killed anyone before?
As you may know,
illegal aliens such as yourself
are being forced out of our country
at an alarming rate.
for the good of both our people.
Our new senator must die.
And for that I will pay you $150,000...
cash.
He was given an offer
he couldn't refuse.
I cost the most...
'cause I'm the best there is.
Aah!
Set up, double-crossed,
and left for dead.
I took a vow of peace.
And now you want me
to help you kill all these men?
Yes, bro.
I mean, Padre.
I will see what I can do.
He knows the score.
Where are my wife and daughter?!
He gets the women.
He's back
Machete
And he kills the bad guys.
No!
Oh, shit.
You mean that a Mexican day laborer
is a goddamn Federale?!
But they soon realized...
He's coming after us.
... they just fucked with the wrong Mexican.
- Uhh!
- Action.
Suspense.
Aaaah!
Emotion.
Please, Father, have mercy.
God has mercy. I don't.
If you are gonna
hire Machete to kill the bad guy,
you better make damn sure
the bad guy isn't you.
Machete
Rated "X".
Brought to you from your friends
at The Weinstein Company.
##
Real pretty tonight, Holly.
God damn it, girls.
If you are gonna do that shit,
do it onstage!
Smoking hot. Whew!
Cherry, darling,
I told you too many fucking times--
you can't be up there crying
and all that shit.
You know what a go-go dance is?
Useless talent number 12?
No, it's a happy dance.
You get up there
and you dance happy.
It's go-go, not cry-cry.
I'm quitting.
You say that
at least one night a week.
I mean it this time.
I need a dramatic change in my life.
I have always said you are funny.
But if you don't stop
all that crying and shit,
I'm gonna have to fire
your fucking ass,
and I don't want to fire your ass
'cause I like looking at your ass.
"Any girl leaving early"
"must check out with their finger"
"and have a bye-bye slip."
Here's my finger.
And here's my bye-bye slip.
MAN: We are gonna need some cash.
Dick. Fuck!
Aah!
Oh!
Ass bag!
Aah!
All right, boys. Come on.
All right, all right. Come on.
You guys know the drill, huh?
Wait here, Lieutenant.
I will handle this.
Hey, Abby.
I can see you have had
a spot of trouble, Romey.
Would you like to tell me
what happened?
Well, they--they escaped.
Uh...
All three?
Yeah, l--
I don't know, uh--
I don't know how they did it.
Just, they got out--
I'm sorry, Romey,
but I just don't trust you anymore.
And you know the rules.
Hold on.
I'm out.
I swear, Abby, I'm--I'm--
You are not gonna
see me anymore, okay?
ABBY: Not so fast.
I also want your balls.
I'm really quite attached to them.
ABBY: Oh, sweetheart.
I was really attached to my specimens.
Now they are out there in the night
doing God knows what.
I can't do it, Abby. Please.
Please, Abby.
Hey. Hey! What are you guys--
Let me go, you motherfuckers!
Son of a bitch!
Abby! Listen!
You don't need Abby!
There's more!
There's more!
I can get you all you want! Abby!
Fuck!. Motherfucking pussies!
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
I can get you more!
No! No! No! Aah!
Aaaaah!
Pick this up, please.
Where's the shit?
The shit's right there.
The deal is still good.
No, it's not.
You held out on me.
Now I want all of it.
Uhh!
Looks like I got you
by the balls, Abby.
You certainly have.
MULDOON: So...
I will ask you one more time.
Where's...
the...
shit?
Everywhere.
Oh, balls.
Get that thing away from my pumps!
It's just overheating.
I need to get to town.
It's just a stripped radiator cap.
Water leaks when it heats up.
No pressure.
You okay?
I'm just cherry.
Go on and have a seat anywhere.
I will be right in.
Here, take this with you.
That's your good spring water.
Ain't nothing good about it.
I bottled it myself.
I get it right there out of the dam.
Thanks...
J. T.
We are serving inside tonight.
The best barbecue in Texas
around the clock.
I gotta go.
Saving lives, are you?
Now, how did you know that?
Now, that's a rump roast.
Mmm.
I couldn't get off work this week.
But you only have to stay till 10:00.
A friend of mine will be here
before 10:00 to pick up Tony.
TONY: I'm going to eat your brains
and gain your knowledge.
What did I tell you?
No playing with toys at the table.
- Didn't I tell you that?
- Yeah.
There's a packed suitcase
under his bed.
Give it to Tony to take with him
when my friend picks him up.
I will leave him watching TV.
But you need to be here
in the next 20 minutes.
Thank you.
Hey, what happened to your tooth?
Fell out.
Wow.
Think you can say a prayer
for your old man?
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.
Amen.
Amen.
Who was that you were talking to?
Babysitter.
She's on her way.
- You believe her?
- No.
Me, neither.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- How's it going, J. T. ?
- All right.
- Still open, I see.
- Oh, yeah, all night.
Free of charge.
Tonight...
is a special night.
What's so special about tonight?
Been open 25 years.
You are the second person
to show up tonight.
Who's the first?
Right there.
Must be passing through.
Seems only strangers eat here.
I still eat here, J. T.
Oh, yeah, you sure do.
By the way, don't choke
on all that food you are eating.
Hello, Palomita.
I don't go by that name anymore.
So, uh...
you ever become that--
that fancy doctor?
Never did.
I thought for sure you would.
Talked about it enough.
That's the problem with goals--
they become the thing you talk about
instead of the thing you do.
That's my jacket.
I looked for it for two weeks.
Yeah? How long did you
look for me, Wray?
Yeah, well, the jacket belonged to me.
You didn't.
So, um...
what are you doing now?
I'm going to be a stand-up comedian.
Really?
You are not funny.
That's what I have been trying
to tell everybody,
but they all say I'm hysterical.
But you are not.
There's a difference
between being frank
and being dick.
Yeah, well...
it was really good seeing you again.
Oh. Um...
what name do you go by now...
in case I want to catch
one of your shows?
Cherry.
Cherry Darling.
Sounds like a stripper.
No, it sounds like a go-go dancer.
There's a difference.
Right.
Well...
you will always be Palomita to me.
I need a ride.
What do you say, El Wray?
I will give you a ride.
Good-bye, Bill.
- Don't you mean "see you later"?
- Of course.
Hey. What's up, Doc?
The little lady's looking
pretty good there, I gotta say.
Looks like she could suck
the bend out of a river.
I'm kidding. Heh.
- Take a look at that shit.
- BILL: What happened to your arm?
Well, uh... I got bit.
Bit? Bit by what?
Well, if I told you,
you probably wouldn't believe me.
I need some Bactine or something?
Whew.
Can't you just... sew it up?
Well, normally I would.
I would even be doing something
to stop the bleeding.
The only problem is
this one doesn't bleed.
DR FELIX:
Oh, shit. Check this out.
When this was still a military hospital,
this one guy came back
from Iraq with this.
Whew!
Chronic herpetic lesions.
When he urinated, it came out
through all these little holes here,
kind of like a fountain.
Oh, Jesus.
Well, how would you treat it?
Fuck that. I was never in Iraq.
Good for you. The shit they spread
around there you wouldn't believe.
I swear to God.
I have got these Iraqi eyeballs
a friend of mine brought back
to do some studies on.
Incredible. They were
completely milked over.
Mustard gas--
it does that to your eyes.
Actually, I still have those in my fridge.
Bot fly, do you think?
DR FELIX:
Chronic viral ulcerative lesion.
That looks like gout.
He's running a temperature of 105.
- Is that bad?
- It's high.
Bad will be 108.
You could have a seizure,
go psychotic.
And--and probably die.
Say "ahh. "
- Ahh.
- Oh! Jesus!
Oh, nice.
Black abscessed tongue.
All abscesses
should be drained, period.
What are you doing?
Shut up, Joe.
Baby... get the needles.
Be right there.
BILL:
Right now.
Asshole.
It's spreading.
Holy shit.
- When did you say you got this bite?
- Just now.
We gotta lose the arm, Joe.
Lose the arm?
What do you mean, lose the arm? My arm?
It's spreading all the way
up to your shoulder.
Now, if we don't sever that arm now,
it's gonna take over your chest,
and we can't very well
cut that off, can we?
Well, shouldn't I get a second opinion?
Hi, Joe.
I'm going to give you
a very strong anesthetic,
so you won't feel anything
during the procedure.
These...
... are my friends.
My yellow friend...
- ... is just to take the sting off.
- Aah!
My blue friend...
you will barely feel.
That means my yellow friend
is already taking effect.
See how fast my friends work?
And after my red-headed friend...
... you will never see me again.
... see me again, see me again.
They all react differently.
Now what?
RADIO DJ:
Dedicated to our own Jungle Julia--
It's not the radiator.
Damn it.
All right.
Fucking thing.
Cheap--whoa.
Damn light.
Ohh.
Hey. Hey!
Hey! Bastard!
Bastard!
Oh, thank God.
Oh.
Oh. Hey!
-
- Hey! Hey!
MAN: Get outta
the fucking road, bitch!
Ohh! Stop!
Stop!
Please! Stop!
WOMAN: No! No!
What the hell was that?
People picking up road kill.
What, like an armadillo?
Deer.
You get a lot of them around here.
You know, I read a statistic that said...
that the eating of venison has risen
People eat road kill?
If you are driving out here
at 70 miles an hour
and a deer darts out
in front of you,
if you blink or brake or swerve--
shit, you will just kill yourself.
So, what do you do?
Just pick them off...
just like this.
Send it flying away from you.
Unacceptable.
Oh, fuck!
CHERRY: Aah! Aah!
Cherry?
I thought you said if you saw a deer,
you shouldn't fucking swerve!
It wasn't a deer.
Cherry! Cherry! No!
CHERRY: Aah!
Palomita.
- Don't let her die on me, Block.
- What do we got?
Car accident. Heavy contusions
about the torso,
possible spinal trauma...
one severed limb.
Where's the leg?
Three sickos attacked her.
I shot at them.
I never miss.
They took the leg with them.
You will have to come with us, Wray.
We need to talk about this, you know?
He has to sign her in.
Do what, now?.
Well, he's with her.
He's responsible for her.
He can fill this out after we talk.
Let's go.
What are you doing
with a rifle, Wray?
Nothing.
Just thinking about maybe doing
some hunting when the season breaks.
Come on, Wray.
You know you are not supposed
to be doing that stuff anymore.
And here I stick my neck out for you.
Now you have got a gal in your wrecked truck
with a missing leg?
A missing leg that's now missing?
And here you are saying
in front of everybody
that someone up and snatched it?
And that you shot at them with a gun
that you never should have had
in the first place?
And that now they are gone?
Sheriff, can we finish
this conversation somewhere else?
My thought exactly.
Doctor Block!
Three fresh ones rolling in!
Christ, you are kidding.
PARAMEDIC: Automobile accident
off of Highway 18.
DOAs?
Have Andy pick them up.
That's unsanitary, Doc.
Helps me monitor
my state of calmness.
Yeah, don't get all worked up
enough to crack it.
Fuck.
You might cut yourself pretty good.
Then I would know I was not calm.
Yeah, what do you say now, Doc?
Somebody call my wife.
Sheriff Hague.
J.T., how's the barbecue business?
Ever since that bastard landlord
raised the rent, it's gone to shit.
Well, I'm real sorry
to hear about that.
I wish there was something
I could do.
DC-2?
Right now I ain't calling my brother.
I'm calling the sheriff.
I'm listening. What's the trouble?
Well, what about
countering with atropine?
J.T.: Well. there ain't no trouble.
Not yet. anyway.
I got two delinquents been hanging
around here for over an hour.
They won't purchase
and they won't leave.
Oh, never mind. Here they come.
You cook that meat
at 250 degrees, don't you?
I don't remember.
I set the heat with my hand.
You give me that recipe, or I will raise
your rent higher than a Georgia pine.
Brother, ain't no Texans ever gonna
give you his barbecue recipe.
That's a fact.
He will take it to his grave.
I could be bleeding like a stuck pig.
I ain't gonna tell you.
WRAY: Okay. Gotcha, gotcha.
J.T.: I could be dying in your arms.
I ain't gonna tell you!
- Heh heh heh.
- We will see about that.
You gonna look.
or you gonna eat?
You called for me?
I need for you to see this.
PARAMEDIC: Looks like a no-brainer.
BILL: What does that mean?
SECOND PARAMEDIC: No brain.
Scooped clean out of her skull.
DR FELIX: Oh, oh, oh!
I know what this is.
Don't tell me.
Uh... liquefactive necrosis.
PARAMEDIC: You think?
DR FELIX: Oh, sure, yeah.
Thank you. That will be all.
Oh...
Did you know she was back in town?
No.
I didn't.
What happened to her?
I don't know, baby.
I thought you stopped
seeing each other.
We have.
Well, yes, you have now--
she's fucking dead.
I mean, we--
we stopped before.
I--
I haven't talked to her in a while.
But you have written each other.
Here and there.
But not--
What are you doing?!
Let me see your last three messages.
- You have no right.
- I don't?
I don't have a right?
Show it to me.
Show it to me.
No.
Aah!
Now, that's just to take the sting off.
Show it to me.
No, please.
- Show... it... to... me!
- Aaahh! Aah! Aah!
Now let's see how fast
your friends work.
That's pretty fast.
Oh, what do I know, my love?
Exactly.
That you are a cheating, lying...
sack.
I didn't want to hurt you.
BILL:
But you did.
Bill...
you are insane.
And I was afraid...
of what you might do to me,
to our son.
I'm the mother of your son.
Aah!
And after this one...
I will never see you again.
PARAMEDIC: Doc.
What?
You gotta see this.
I will be right there.
Where the hell are the bodies?
That's what we wanted to show you.
They are gone.
They didn't just get up
and walk out, did they?
# Mmm-hmm #
Okay.
Okay.
Shut the fuck up!
Somebody take care of this perp for me
before I fucking kill him!
What the hell's going on?
Ah, he was causing a ruckus
over at Skip's place, so I cuffed him,
and the son of a bitch
bit my goddamn finger off!
Quit your hollering and get yourself
a goddamn Band-Aid.
I'm not exaggerating,
using colorful speech, Sheriff.
He bit my finger clean off!
Fucking shit!
Get out there and book him,
'cause I will fucking kill him
if I have to do it.
Carlos, go get him.
Wray, you stay put.
Are you sure he's in there?
He was.
Motherfucker.
He's gone.
Broke out the window.
Where's my finger?
Found your ring.
Could it be the same guy
as your leg-snatcher?
WRAY: I didn't get
a good look at mine.
That him over there?
Whoa! Whoa!
Aah!
- Wray?
-
Fuck.
You motherfucker!
Uhh!
- No, don't touch him!
- Why not?
He's infected.
With what?
Everything.
Wray!
Drop the fucking gun.
Where the fuck
do you think you are going?!
I'm gonna go get Cherry!
Fine. But we are taking my car.
I'm riding with you.
Don't make any sudden moves.
Viral infections.
They came pouring in.
Some are rapidly developing
coliform lesions.
Highly contagious.
What do you think?
Self-preservation comes to mind.
Yeah. Let's get the hell out of here.
First let me get my wife.
I love you, sweetie.
There you go, bunny rabbit.
Come on, come on.
Open up, now.
I want you to be around for a while,
you understand?
We don't want you checking out
right this--
God... damn.
Ramona.
You been farting like a goddamn
pack mule since I met--
God damn!
SHERIFF HAGUE:
I hate to do this to you Earl.
Bring some guns... and ammo!
Meet me at my brother's!
I gotcha. I will be there.
Gotta eat quick, sweetie.
Come on.
Ramona.
Ramona.
Aah!
Uhh!
Aaaah!
Oh, my God.
What the hell is going on?
Are you gonna give me a gun?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Uhh!
Palomita?
Get up. We are leaving.
I can't walk.
So what? Get up!
- Get--
- Aah!
Uhh!
Motherfucker.
Look at me!
Look at me!
I was gonna be a stand-up comedian.
But who's gonna laugh now?
Some of their best jokes
are about cripples.
Let's go.
It's not funny. It's pathetic.
Would you stop crying over fucking...
spilled milk?
I have no leg!
Now you do.
What do you think?
You could carry me, Wray.
Yeah? You never wanted that before.
Why start now?
Ah-ah!
Uhh!
Ahh!
Uhh!
This is fucking ridiculous.
The sheriff must have
taken the others to J. T's.
Get in.
God damn it, wait for me.
My leg's stuck in the door!
- It's just wood.
- It's splintering.
Will you just leave it alone?
Why is this happening to me?
I don't know. Just--
just do me a favor right now and just...
stay strong.
"Stay"?
Yeah, baby. Stay.
Okay, my name is Electra.
Fucking listen.
My name is Electra.
Her name is Electra, too.
It's furry.
No.
He's a furry one.
She goes by Lia, I go by El.
El from "Electra", Ame from "Amelia".
Does that make
any fucking sense in your head?
You can call me whatever the fuck
you want--I don't give a shit.
- You said 10:00!
- I'm sorry.
We can't be watching your kid
all goddamn night!
Your friend never showed up,
and we got shit to do!
That's right.
Then start doing it.
Oh!
Uhh!
Tony! We are leaving!
Wait, my tarantula.
Bring it. Let's go.
And my turtle.
And my scorpion.
We are not all octopuses.
We can't carry everything.
"Octopi."
Ohh... come on, let's go.
Tony, what did I tell you?
You can't bring them all.
Didn't I tell you that?
It's okay. They can live
in the same tank.
What about my pocket bike?
It's in the trunk.
Aah!
Where do you think you are going,
you fucking bitch?!
We are gonna fucking kill you!
Are you sure you want to do this?
SHERIFF HAGUE: Everybody grab a badge and a gun.
You are all deputies
as of this moment forward.
Except for you, Wray.
Yo.
What do we got?
Some thing's wrong up there.
J.T. always comes out and greets.
Let's go.
Try not to shoot yourselves.
Don't shoot each other.
But especially...
don't shoot me.
J.T.?
Go on! Get off him, Rusty!
God damn, J.T.
Yah!
-
-
Barbecue?
Asshole.
Damn good sausage link, J.T.
Best in Texas.
Must have passed out
after I killed those things.
Nice shooting.
Everybody gather up supplies.
We head out in 20!
I want you to open that for Mommy.
Now, take the gun.
Careful.
And if anyone comes to the door
that isn't me,
I want you to shoot them, okay?
I'm not kidding, Tony.
You shoot them...
just like your video games.
You shoot them in the head.
What if it's Dad?
Especially if it's your dad.
And be careful
where you point that thing.
You will blow your own face off.
I will be right back.
I love you.
Tony!
Aah!
Hello, baby.
Ohh!
Stay away!
Look what you did to our son!
Stay away!
God damn it, I told you
I didn't want to see you again.
Daddy!
Get your sorry ass in here!
Aah!
If it's escape vehicles you want,
escape vehicles I got.
Right this way.
Watch that meat.
Meet my wife.
Jesse James Custom Dominator.
I made Jesse a plate of barbecue
so goddamn good,
he made this baby for me
free of fucking charge. Heh heh heh.
Got anything that could
transport more people?
Where's the top?
This baby's chopped permanent.
Ain't got no roll bar, chicken wire,
none of that shit.
- No protection.
- But she's fast.
Nitrous-injected,
Who are you?
I mean, really.
Wray's Wreckage.
That's what it says on your truck.
Are you a wrecker, Wray?
I'm nobody.
It's the easiest thing to remember.
So remember it.
J.T: Just stack them
on top of the counter.
Hey, you want some barbecue?
Heh heh heh. Best in Texas.
Aw, no, thanks.
What's the matter,
you don't eat meat?
Oh, I eat meat.
I also eat lots of shit.
You see this?
What's that?
Shit-eating grin.
You ought to be a comedian.
What do you think of the leg?
Oh, that's funny.
How's your stump?
They knocked it out something fierce.
Still can't feel a thing.
This must be the real Bone Shack.
Old J. T. knows how to live.
Like fuck he does.
I like how you say "fuck".
Good. Fuck you.
Fuck me?
Oh, so, now you are the comedian.
Go ahead, drop your pants.
That will be good for a laugh.
I highly doubt that.
That's my jacket.
Yes, I know.
I looked for it for two weeks.
Look, you were being
an unbelievable dick.
I was walking out on you.
I was cold.
I took your fucking jacket.
So, if you are gonna go on one of your
psycho obsessive controlling rants
about a fucking jacket,
then fucking take it,
'cause I would rather fucking freeze
than fucking hear about it one more time.
Did you find what was in the pocket?
Fuck no.
Look for it.
No, the other one.
I was gonna give it to you,
but you left me.
You took the jacket.
And I looked for it for two weeks.
Read it.
"Two against the world. "
Remember that?
I never forgot it.
Then why would you leave?
Because you didn't believe in us,
or in me.
I figured one of them new deputies
might end up shooting me,
but not you, Tolo!
Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Dumb-ass.
- You are gonna be all right.
- McGraw's here.
- WOMAN: Now, now, now.
- And a whole bunch of others.
- Everybody in!
Come on!
Over here.
Move your ass! Come on!
What did I tell you, Tony?
Don't point the gun at yourself.
Didn't I tell you that?
Thank you for telling me about...
you know.
Don't mention it.
That's an order.
If I had known that you were...
I wouldn't have given you
such a hard time.
I didn't mean to be a prick about it.
Need-to-know basis, that kind of shit.
Take this.
Do what you do best.
No, you are not!
Don't give him the gun. Not--
Give him the gun, Tolo.
Give him the gun.
Give him all the guns.
Holy shit.
That boy's got the devil in him.
We gotta fight them off.
Get to our vehicles.
Everyone behind me!
Outside now!
God damn you!
Everybody back inside!
You, Skip.
Front and center.
You go out front,
start up the Kill Dozer.
We will need it to transport
the other survivors.
You fucking crazy?
I'm not going out there.
- I will cover you.
- I'm not going.
I never miss.
Come on, Skip.
It's go-go.
Not cry-cry.
Cherry!
Oh, dear.
-
- Ah!
Aah!
J. T. !
You take whoever you can fit
in your convertible.
Everyone else on board!
Skip, grab the twins!
Come along with me!
You take the chopper.
I need someone else
to drive my truck!
I will do it.
You are bleeding like a stuck pig.
Your vision's blurred
and you are on your last legs.
Anything else?
Don't wreck it.
Somebody grab the slaw!
You can't have no barbecue
without coleslaw!
- Give me a gun.
- Take this.
Fucking cool!
All right, y'all, head out.
I will hold them off.
I can take care of myself.
Bye, Daddy.
Do you remember how to ride a bike?
Useless talent number 32.
Good.
Anyone else have a car?
Now, you are sure you are okay
driving this thing?
Hell yeah.
Dakota...
we are sorry about Tony.
Thanks.
Your engine is shot
and you have got three blown tires.
But I have got his pocket bike
in the trunk.
Is it fast?
Zero to fifty in four seconds.
You ride with her.
I'm Cherry.
You sure are.
Move out!
Damn shame.
-
- Rusty!
-
- Aah!
God damn it!
Aah!
Sheriff! How much ammo we got?
Not enough.
Don't shoot!
We are not infected!
MULDOON: All survivors gotta come with us.
Especially you...
El Wray.
I don't go by that name anymore.
It's okay. It's okay.
We are here in quarantine
with the other survivors.
Where is here?
CHERRY: The old army base.
El Wray?
That you?
He's with them.
I saw him in their convoy earlier.
I'm a scientist...
and a businessman.
Not military.
Which is why he's gonna tell us
what the fuck is going on.
They are stealing biochemical weapons.
DC-2?
Also known as "Project Terror. "
Designed to take out an entire populace
in a controlled landlocked area.
You were supplying it to them.
- That's why they shut you out.
- They found my supply.
It's under our feet.
Ten stories down.
The only treatment
is a regimented exposure to DC-2 itself.
It delays the negative effects.
They need it...
like a drug.
Correct. But we found that
a small percentage of people
are not affected by the gas itself,
and within this small percentage
lies a cure.
What do you want to do?
Mexico.
Put our backs against the ocean
and defend ourselves from there.
No. We have to get back to my lab.
This infection will spread
all over the world,
to every man, woman and child,
unless I finish my antidote.
You have an antidote?
You! You!
Come with us.
Move it!
Move it, Peggy!
Uhh!
Do you like Ava Gardner?
I'm sorry?
Ava Gardner.
Do you like her?
Yeah, I guess.
I was just thinking that you, uh...
kind of look like Ava Gardner
a little bit.
You got something
you want to say to me?
I have nothing to say to you.
You got nothing to say, huh?
That's funny.
'Cause I could have swore you just
gave me a "fuck you" look right now.
You want to say "fuck you" to me?
Not at this moment.
You know what this is?
A gun.
It's simplicity itself.
You see, you point it
at what you want to die...
and you pull the little trigger here...
and a little bullet comes out of here.
And the little bullet
hits you right there.
And you know what?
You don't look like
Ava Gardner no more.
Don't taunt me, tramp.
I am not one to be taunted.
You got it?
Let me here you say, "l got it. "
I got it.
You damn well better.
Tool.
J.T.:
God damn it, that's it.
I figured it out.
Salt.
Got it all figured out. It's salt.
Blood is salty.
That's all my sauce needed,
was just a little more salt.
It just needed a little thickening agent.
You know what I'm talking about?
What are you doing, J. T. ?
That's all I gotta do,
is put a little more salt in.
It would just do the same goddamn thing
that the blood did.
I tell you what, brother,
that little bit of blood did the trick.
Don't do nothing stupid, J. T.
I got it covered.
It's already got my sweat, it's got my tears.
Now all it needs is some blood!
- Drop the gun!
- J.T.!
- Do it now!
- Okay, okay!
Don't shoot!
J.T., you all right?
Uhh!
Hey, you all right, bro?
J.T.: God damn it,
I'm not all right at all, brother.
Not at all.
Wait here.
Oh... I sure will.
Goddamn sauce.
I'm gonna go get my dick wet.
She's got one leg.
Easier access.
You got a point.
Get the rest of this shit upstairs
and we will blow this entire floor.
Yes, sir.
Get Lewis down here.
He's getting his dick wet, sir.
Get him the fuck down here now!
Lewis?
Wilson?
Where are my men?
I have got several right here.
What the fuck's this?
Their balls, sweetheart.
I'm walking out of here
with this shit, Wray.
- Let us go.
- Tell me why we should.
Because I earned it.
How do you figure that?
You want the story?
I will spin it for you quick.
A termite's nest of caves
on the Afghan border,
me and my men walking around
with our dicks in our hands
and our balls in our throats,
looking for America's most wanted.
- Bin Laden.
- Yeah.
For once, our intel
was right on the money.
I come around a corner--
Bam, there he is,
looking me right in the eyes.
Wait.
You killed bin Laden?
I put two in his heart,
one in his computer.
So that was you.
Yeah.
That was me.
Class-A cluster-fuck.
He wasn't supposed to be there,
we weren't supposed to be there,
and I sure as fuck wasn't supposed to be
the one to punch his dialysis ticket.
So, instead of a chest full of medals,
we get a face full of DC-2.
No cure.
That is, not until we found
somebody from the other side
willing to sell us batches of this shit.
Science comes first, but business
comes a close fucking second.
WRAY: Then you realized if you could
infect a large enough populace,
the experiment and its survivors,
you would find a cure.
I swore to my men
that I would do everything in my power
to keep them alive.
And that's what I intend to do, Wray.
Understand?
I never had a choice.
Neither do l, sir.
God bless you
and your service to this country.
You are a doctor?
Heh.
I was earlier tonight.
I always wanted to be a doctor.
Instead, I can do...
this.
Ohh. Useless talent number 66.
I'm very pliable.
DAKOTA: A girlfriend of mine
had a theory.
She said at some point in your life,
you find a use for every useless talent
you ever had.
It's like, uh, connecting the dots.
I'm not that optimistic.
I feel like I'm sinking down the drain
and I can't get out.
She would say...
when you are stuck in that spiral...
you reach up.
What if there's nothing up there?
Just reach up.
You are a dancer.
I was earlier tonight.
Well, I'm pulling you out of retirement!
Get your ass up!
Now, I'm starved for entertainment, baby,
and that means you.
Radio!
Wail, baby, now!
 Going to a party... 
That's--
That's what I'm talking about.
Dance it up.
Keep dancing!
 'Cause now. I'm jaded... 
I have seen me
some crazy ass shit in my day...
but ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.
I have seen me a stripper
with one breast,
and I have seen me a stripper
with 12 toes,
and I have seen me a stripper
with no brains at all,
but I ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.
And I have been to Morocco.
Dance, bitch!
Break a leg!
Break it off! Ha ha!
Dance for me, motherfucker.
- Uhh!
- Aaaaah!
Aah!
Ohhhh!
You thought it was pretty funny,
didn't you?
Actually, yes.
You gave me some wood,
now I'm gonna give you...
some fucking wood!
Ah--ah!
Ahh!
The gas! You need your gas!
No! Fuck the gas, fuck it.
I'm just gonna have to make this quick.
Aah!
Uhh!
Where would you get that?
Useless talent number 37.
Aaaaah!
Uhh! Uhh!
I broke my leg.
That's okay.
I made you something.
I do believe in you.
Always have.
I believe that you could be better.
You deserve better,
even better than me.
Right now,
I need you to become...
who you are meant to be.
Stand.
I would stand clear if I were you.
Open that door, will you, baby?
Uhh!
They have destroyed most of the tanks.
Any that are left
we will get on our way to the helicopters.
There are two helicopters,
big enough to take all of us.
Who can fly?
Can anyone else fly a helicopter?
I can fly, but...
no way in hell I'm gonna fly tonight.
Okay. Cool.
I will fly.
Let's go.
I think we are gonna stay here, Wray.
You will take care of this for me,
then, Sheriff?
With pleasure.
Three minutes.
Your brother's a good man, J.T.
Best in Texas.
Hop on.
No, the other way.
Oh.
No. The other way.
The helicopters are
on the other side of this wall.
We make a run for it!
No! If we all get killed,
there's no stopping this plague.
Don't you get it?
We are the antidote.
Well, is there another way around?
Wait here.
I don't suppose there are any other
biochemical engineers around? Heh.
Take that as a no.
We have to get over that wall!
I was thinking we could build us
a new place,
right there where the old one was.
You cook,
I work the back.
You don't make that rent
so goddamn high.
We share the recipe,
we share the rent.
Start at 250 degrees.
I knew it.
For how long?
- 12 pounds?
- Sure.
Wrapped in tin foil, right?
I don't use no goddamn foil.
Damn.
Tomatoes? Fresh?
Canned.
- No shit?
- Yeah.
You score me some?
Oh, yeah.
'Cause we are brothers.
Thank you for this.
You just remember...
you got to take this recipe
to your grave.
I think I can...
goddamn guarantee that.
That's our cue.
Cherry, darling...
it's all you.
Let's go!
Aah!
Wray!
Damn it, Wray.
Ohh.
Okay. You need to get up
'cause we are leaving.
They told me I would find you here.
I was beginning to lose hope.
I'm sorry...
but I lied.
I did want to hurt you.
My turn.
No more dead bodies
for Daddy tonight.
Never did like that son of a bitch.
About as useless
as a pecker on a pope.
Don't touch anything.
I want to fly it.
- He said not to touch anything!
- You don't know what you are doing!
- I do know what I'm doing!
- No, you don't!
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Shut up, sit down...
and don't fucking touch anything!
Everybody sit down!
Whoo!
Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi
R-r-r-r-rah -ha!
Hit the wipers.
Go on, leave me.
I am not leaving you here like this.
Motherfuckers around here
eat road kill.
See? I'm funny.
I made you laugh.
Go to the ocean.
Put your backs to it.
Protect yourselves there.
I'm not leaving you, Wray.
It's two against the world.
It will be.
I promise.
I never miss.
Don't worry, baby.
You will find your way.
Reach up!
DAKOTA: Reach up!
##
CHERRY: It's like you said
it would be, Wray.
I'm like you said I would be.
I find the lost...
the weary...
those that have no hope.
I find them and I lead them...
to a land we have made for ourselves.
The land by the sea.
It's beautiful.
She's beautiful.
I wish you could see us, us two.
It's like you said it would be.
Two against the world, baby.
Two against the world.
This film is a brilliant achievement in motion picture history.
Finally, the truth about Hitler's diabolical plans
to create a race of superwomen can be told.
'Werewolf Women of the SS'
Welcome to Death Camp 13.
Home of the Nazis' diabolical plan.
To create an army of super werewolf soldiers.
This is projected.
Its failure will be your demise...
... and the end of Germany, Borman.
Hail, Hitler!
You have been chosen.
Rejoice.
I have found the perfect solution.
The She-Devils of Belzac.
Can they alone supply the blood
needed to save Hitler's mad dreams?
Or with the pride of Germany fall into ruin?
This is my project.
We are now in total control of "Pure Wolf".
This is an outrage!
Highlights!
Featuring Udo Kier
Sheri Moon Zombie
Tom Towles
Sybil Danning
Bill Moseley
And Nicolas Cage...
as ...
Fu Manchu.
This is my Mecca!

BUTTERFLY: Hold on, I gotta come up!
I have gotta take
the world's biggest fucking piss.
JUNGLE JULIA: We can't be late!
We won't!
Who's... who's holding?
If you are not, then nobody.
We were kind of hoping you were.
- Yeah. How are you not holding?
- Jesus Christ, Shanna.
It is not my fucking job to supply y'all
with weed when we go out.
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, little lady.
You are getting angry kind of quick,
don't you think?
I was just teasing you!
I'm not angry.
It just would be nice
if y'all didn't just count on me
all the fucking time
and surprise me
every once in a while with pot.
Okay, mean girl
in a high school movie.
Are you through
having a tantrum?
I'm not having a tantrum.
Come on, don't fight.
I will pay for it when we get some.
One, it is not about the money.
It is about the pain in the ass of scoring.
And two, we are not really fighting.
Arlene, you have forgotten what
hanging out with Jungle Julia is like.
That wasn't a fight.
That was Julia
acting like a grumpy bitch
and me calling her on it
and indulging her at the same time.
Oh! Billboard!
Okay, is Christian Simonson
gonna be there?
You bet your ass he is...
Christian Simonson,
the filmmaker, is in town.
He's got a big thing for Julia.
If he had a big thing for me,
he would fucking call me,
as opposed to disappearing
for six months,
and he would get his ass down here
more often than he does.
And on my birthday
he would give me a fucking phone call.
But other than that he's putty
in my hands.
So what's the plan, man?
Margaritas and Mexican
food at Guero's,
touch base with Chris and Jesse,
tell them about later,
and make damn sure they come.
Those other guys will be waiting for us
at the Texas Chili Parlor.
Oh, shit. Speaking of which...
what happened
with you and Nate last night?
Well, you know, not much.
We just fucking met each other.
If you don't bust their balls a little bit,
they are never gonna respect you.
Okay, we are pretty clear
on what it is you didn't do.
How about enlightening us
on what it is you did do?
Oh, nothing to write home about.
We just made out on the couch
for about 20 minutes.
Dressed, half-dressed, or naked?
Dressed. I said we made out.
We didn't do "the thing. "
Oh, excuse me for living,
but what is "the thing"?
You know, it's everything but.
They call that "the thing"?
I call it "the thing. "
Do guys like "the thing"?
They like it better than "no thing. "
Okay, I wanna get back
to what it is you did do.
So you are making out
on the couch with Nate, right?
Correct.
Whose couch?
His or the one in your hotel room?
What am I, stupid over here? Mine.
Were you making out
sitting up or lying down?
We started sitting up,
we worked our way to lying down.
Hmm. The plot thickens.
Who was on top?
I was straddling him.
- So what about tonight?
- Well, we will see, Shanna.
I mean I like Nate.
He's cute, he's a pretty good kisser.
But it ain't a done deal.
Yeah, fuck Nate.
I mean, he's cute and all,
but Jesse Letterman
is gonna be all over her.
Jessie Letterman the Austin director
who did "Potheads"?
He's a good friend.
Maybe they can bring some pot.
Fuck that. No.
I don't wanna be either A,
depending on their fucking ass,
or B, depending on their ass.
Uh-uh. If we don't score ourselves,
we are gonna be stuck with them
all fucking night.
Ooh! Try Lanna-Frank.
Best idea you had all day.
Oh, hey! That's your
last billboard before Guero's!
Oh, come on, give me a break.
Oh, come on, my ass!
We said every time.
Okay.
##
BUTTERFLY:
Jules, let me get a drag.
Thanks.
GIRL: Oh, my God.
Hey, this is...
and It's U.T. days, Arlene.
MARCY, BUTTERFLY: Hey.
- You wanna join us?
- For a second, but I'm with some friends.
Ooh...
So, you must be-- must be--
So, you must be
the infamous Butterfly.
SHANNA, JUNGLE JULIA: Shh!
She don't know nothing about it.
- Know about what?
- When were y'all gonna tell her?
- Soon.
- Tell me what?
Yeah, now thanks to you,
we have gotta tell her sooner than later.
All right, cut the shit.
What the fuck is going on?
I said a little something-something
about you on the air today.
Julia, what the fuck
did you say about me on the radio?
All I said was I had
a sexy friend named Butterfly
who was in from out-of-town
for the weekend,
and we would be going out
somewhere in Austin tonight,
and if they were out on the town,
maybe they would see us.
And I described you, and I said
that if they spotted you while we were out,
if they would do something,
you would do something.
Okay, now, Julia, I'm serious.
What did you say
and what did you say I would do?
Anyhow, I could explain what I said,
which would be boring,
or Marcy over here,
who is an incredible actress,
could act it out for you,
which I think will give you a better idea
what you have in store for you tonight.
Okay, so just tell me your way.
- So we will act it out with Marcy?
- Sure.
Okay, give Marcy your drink.
Okay, so you are
in a club or a bar,
and Marcy's a kind of cute
or kind of hot or kind of sexy
or better be
fucking hysterically funny,
but not-funny-looking guy
who you could fuck.
Got it.
Okay, Marcy, take it.
Howdy.
Hi, there.
Excuse me, but...
your name wouldn't be
"Butterfly, " would it?
Yes, it is, and it seems
you have me at a disadvantage.
Barry.
Pleased to meet you, Barry.
Y'all are getting me hot!
Shh!
So is, uh...
"Butterfly" your real name?
Yes, it is.
And how would you know
my name, Barry?
I listened to Jungle Julia's show
this morning.
Oh, you did, did you?
Oh, yeah, I listen to her show
every morning.
Oh, you do, do you?
Yeah, she's like
the coolest lady in town.
Don't you think
she's got a big ass?
Nah, man!
I like her ass that way.
She got a black girl's ass.
Well, that's what she always says,
but in actual fact, she doesn't
really have a black girl's ass.
She's got a 'big' ass.
Okay, what the fuck
are you doing?
Look who wants
to get to the point all of a sudden.
Okay, we will get to the point,
but for your information,
skinny bitch,
black men and a whole lot
of motherfucking white men
have had plenty of fun
adoring my ass.
I don't wear their teeth marks
on my butt for nothing.
If you are not gonna buy me a drink,
can I have mine back?
No, okay, okay, okay, okay.
So, Butterfly...
can I buy you a drink?
I would love one.
What can I get ya?
I will take a margarita.
Here ya go.
So, after they buy you a drink
when they raise
their glass to toast,
they look you dead in the eye
and repeat this poem--
"The woods are lovely,
dark and deep
And I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep. "
Did you hear me, Butterfly?
"Miles to go before you sleep. "
And then, if they say that...
you gotta give them a lap dance.
- BUTTERFLY: What?
-
If they call you "Butterfly, "
buy you a drink, repeat that poem,
you gotta give them a lap dance.
That's bullshit.
I ain't giving them nothing.
Well, you can do it or not,
but if you don't,
everybody in Austin
is gonna think you a chicken shit.
And I don't think you want
everybody in Austin
thinking you are a chicken shit.
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance
'cause of what you said.
Look. You don't have to do it
for anybody you don't want.
I said you would do it
for the first guy who says it.
So, some geek comes over
trying to be cool,
just tell him you already did it
at another place earlier.
No harm, no foul,
but you get a free drink out of it.
But maybe a little later
in the evening,
you have had a few drinks,
you are kind of loosey-goosey,
you are safe with your girls,
then some kind of cute,
kind of hot, kind of sexy,
hysterically funny, but not-funny-looking guy
comes up and says it...
then maybe you did it earlier,
maybe you didn't.
##
 Baby 
 It doesn't matter
what they say 
 I know I'm gonna love you
any old way 
 What can I do without you? 
 Don't want nobody. nobody 
 Baby, it's you 
 Baby, it's you 
 Don't leave me alone 
 Come on home 
 Baby, it's you 
 Baby, it's you... 
Any dead soldiers here?
Uh, these two. Thank you.
Where the hell is Lanna-Frank?
That's a good fucking question.
Lanna-Frank!
Where are you?
Well, come over already.
We are waiting for you.
- ##
- Shit! Hold on!
So, where are you?
Come over already.
We are waiting for you.
No. We are not coming over there.
You come over here
like you said you would.
So, is it Shauna and the girls
at the lake house this weekend?
- Shauna?
- Oh, fuck. l...
No.
Now, there is one thing
that every girl in the whole world
whose name is Shanna
has in common with each other.
We all hate the name "Shauna, "
and we really hate it
when people call us "Shauna. "
Just remember...
it's "Shanna Banana, "
not "Shauna Banauna. "
Okay, but at some point in the evening,
I had fuckability stock.
- Yeah, I mean, it wasn't bullish, but...
-
##
Okay... Warren's sending over shots,
and you know the house rules.
If he sends over shots,
you gotta do them.
- What?
- Hey, them's the rules, baby.
- Warren says it, we do it!
- WARREN: I love that philosophy!
"Warren says it, we do it. "
So let's do it!
What is it?
Hey, shot first, questions later.
Here we go. Post time!
WARREN: Mmm!
Whoo-hoo!
Now, is that a tasty beverage
or is that a tasty beverage?
What the fuck is it?!
Chartreuse.
The only liquor so good
they named a color after it.
Who's down for wouldos' Chartreuse?
-
- Not me.
I'm going out for a smoke.
Okay, but careful where you keep
that hot flame, all right?
WARREN: You will blow up the joint.
##
OMAR: Drinks.
What can we get you?
Shanna Banana?
Another big-ass
Long Island iced tea.
Bombay Sapphire
and tonic with no ice.
Good boy.
Oh, hey, Punky.
Uh, one of the lights
is off in the parking lot. Flip it.
##
 It was early. early one morning 
 When I heard my bulldog bark 
 It was Staggolee and Billy Lyons 
 Squabblin ' in the dark... 
Now, look, you can't look like
you are trying to get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up,
but you have got to get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up.
Yeah, but what's the point?
They are going to Shanna's
daddy's house at Lake L.B.J.,
and it's no guys.
Absolutely no guys.
Okay. So after we bring
the girls' drinks,
in fairly rapid order, but not obvious,
we order two more rounds of shots.
You think they are gonna fall for that?
We will be very convincing.
Now it's time to turn up the volume.
No more fucking around.
We go to Jäger shots.
Man, they are not gonna drink Jäger shots.
Dude, as long as
a guy's buying the booze,
a fucking bitch
will drink anything.
Come on, dude, we can
at least get one shot of Jäger
down these
fucking bitches' throats.
After that, we will see if they get
another Jäger shot in them.
You never know.
That could be the shot
that puts them past the point of "fuck it. "
Then all of a sudden
"no guys at the lake house"
turns into a couple of guys
at the lake house.
My point exactly.
Dude, check it out.
I wonder if B.J.
brought the bear with him.
Jesus.
Dude fucking cut himself
falling out of his time machine.
 Well, the last time he shot him 
 caused Billy Lyons to die. 
 Staggolee told Mrs. Billy: 
 “You don’t believe your man is dead? 

JUNGLE JULIA:
And where did you two disappear to?
I had to get something
out of the car,
and Nate was gentlemanly enough
to escort me with his umbrella.
Ah, good for you, Nate.
You see that pretty girl
sitting by herself at the bar?
Who, the dirty hippie?
Meow. She's not a hippie.
She might as well be a hippie.
Thank you, Timmy boy.
Well, do you know
what just happened to her?
No, but I know she's
a skinny, fake, blonde bitch.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were telling a story?
What about her?
PAM: Hey, Warren!
Is there anybody you could
vouch for to give me a ride home?
Fair lady, your chariot awaits.
- You have been eavesdropping?
-
There's eavesdropping
and "can't help but hear. "
I think I belong
in the latter category.
So, uh, Icy Hot.
You are offering me a ride home?
I'm offering you a lift if when
I'm ready to leave, you are, too.
And when are you
thinking about leaving?
Truthfully,
I'm not thinking about it.
But when I do,
you will be the first to know.
Will you be able
to, uh, drive later?
I know looks can be deceiving.
But I'm a teetotaler.
I have been drinking
club soda and lime all night,
and now I'm building up
to my big drink.
- Which is what?
- Virgin piña colada.
Okay. Why would
someone who doesn't drink
spend hours at a bar drinking water?
You know, a bar offers
all kind of things other than alcohol.
Mmm. Really?
Like what?
Women.
Nacho grande platters.
The fellowship
of some fascinating individuals,
like Warren here.
Fair enough.
So what's your name, Icy?
Stuntman Mike.
Stuntman Mike's your name?
Tsk. You ask anybody.
Hey, Warren.
Who is this guy?
WARREN: Stuntman Mike.
And who the hell
is Stuntman Mike?
He's a stuntman.
-
- Warren! Six shots of Wild Turkey!

 Go wrong as I do today 
- # I want you to stop... #
- Well, let's scootch over, now.
It's about fucking time.
Well, beggars can't be choosers.
Take a picture.
It lasts longer.
What?
That table.
Seems to keep,
um, getting your attention.
Is that the girl
from the billboard outside?
Yep.
She sure is a striking-looking woman.
It's got gin, tequila, Jäger...
Look at that hair.
Lots of leave-in conditioner.
Is that jealousy I detect?
Hardly. But if you want
to get with, uh, Jungle Julia,
there's a real easy way to do that.
Really, what would that be?
Get famous. You won't have
to find her... she will find you.
And you don't even want to know
what she did for that billboard.
Enjoy it, cocksucker.
You have earned it.
What did she ever do to you?
We went to school together
from kindergarten through high school.
That's what she did to me.
She was her height right now at 12.
- She was a monster.
-
Half the guys she still fucks
she used to terrorize in the fifth grade.
And she used to beat you up
and take your chocolate milk, huh?
That pituitary case?
Might have kicked my ass
a couple of times...
sorry, I'm built like a girl,
not a black man--
but I would die before I ever gave
Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.
Hey! Are you
famous or something?
Or something.
No, no, no. Really.
Hey, what do-- what do you do?
Really?
What I do is work my ass off to get
my own record label off the ground,
but why that girl wanted a picture of me
is because I'm a local D. J.
Wait a minute.
You have got a billboard
by Big Kahuna Burger, don't you?
Yeah.
I got one there, too, Zatoichi.
Yeah.
Jungle Julia Lucai.
Stuntman Mike McKay.
Well.
Good to meet you, Stuntman Mike.
My friends and I are going
to continue to get our weed on.
Would you care for some?
Thank you, Julia,
but just the same...
no thanks.
- Suit yourself.
- But you know--
Oh, shit.
Ah! My God.
Sorry. It's nothing.
What the fuck was that?
You got some voucher here.
I asked him
what movies you worked on.
No fucking clue.
Well, technically I really don't know
if he's ever done anything for sure.
I mean, he shows me
an episode of 'High Chaparral'.
a guy falls off a horse,
he says it's him.
You know the show 'The Virginian'?
Yeah, well, there was another
actor on that show, Gary Clarke,
and I looked like him a bit--
well, obviously
before I cut myself shaving.
Tsk. Aww, I like it.
Well, damn, if you ain't so sweet
you make sugar taste just like salt.
Anyway, I did a lot of 'Virginians'
doubling Gary Clarke.
And, uh... then that show turned
into 'The Men of Shiloh'.
they brought on Lee Majors,
and I doubled him.
From that point on
I specialized mostly in car stunts.
Yeah, I did damn near
the whole third season of 'Vega$'.
I was Robert Urich's driving double.
And then Bob
did another show, 'Gavilan'.
and he brought me
with him on that, till--
And after that...
Do you know any of these shows
or people I'm talking about?
Sorry.
- No?
- Mm-mm.
No, no.
So how exactly does one
become a stuntman, Stuntman Mike?
Well, in Hollywood, anybody fool enough
to throw himself down a flight of stairs
can usually find somebody
to pay him for it.
But really I got into the business the way
most people get into the stunt business.
How's that?
- My brother got me in it.
- Well, who's your brother?
Stuntman Bob.
I'm ready to blaze!
Finally, yeah.
You need to catch up with us.
- Now the party can start.
- Yep.
Anyhow, I'm sorry.
You forgive me?
But you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time I'm here.
Promise.
You ready to go to the lake?
Mm-hmm.
- How about your friend, bring him?
- I thought no boys.
If you really want him to come,
Shanna won't mind.
So how about it?
Boys or just us girls?
Mmm, us girls.
Good idea.
STUNTMAN MIKE: Ladies?
Thanks.
Cheers, Butterfly.
"The woods are lovely,
dark, and deep...
"And I have promises to keep,
And miles to go
before I sleep. "
Did you hear me, Butterfly?
"Miles to go
before you sleep. "
Sorry, Stuntman Burt--
Mike.
Mike.
She already broke off that dance.
Is that true?
Did I miss my chance?
Do I frighten you?
Is it my scar?
It's your car.
Ah, yeah, I know.
Sorry.
It's my mom's car.
Have you been following us?
No, but that's
what I love about Austin--
it's just so damn small.
- You have seen this guy before?
- I saw him outside of Guero's.
And I saw you outside Guero's, too.
You saw my car,
I saw your legs.
Now, look, I ain't stalking y'all,
but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.
So you really weren't following us?
I'm not following you, Butterfly.
I just... got lucky.
So, how about that lap dance?
Sorry, it was a one-time only offer,
and she did it
earlier this evening at Antone's.
- No, she didn't.
- How do you know?
I'm good that way.
- Tsk. And you look a little touchéd.
- What's "touchéd"?
Wounded, slightly.
Why should I be wounded?
Because you expected guys
to be pestering you all night,
but from your look I can tell
nobody pestered you at all.
That kind of hurt your feelings
a little bit, didn't it?
There are few things as fetching
as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.
So...
How about that lap dance?
I think I'm going
to have to give you a rain check.
Well, since you will be leaving
in the next couple of days,
that rain check will be worthless.
But that's okay.
I understand
if I make you uncomfortable.
You are still a nice girl.
And I still like you.
But I must warn you of something.
You know how people say,
"You are okay in my book, "
or, "In my book, that's no good. "
Well, I actually have a book.
And everybody
I ever meet goes in this book.
And now I have met you,
and you are going in the book.
Except...
I'm afraid I must file you...
under...
"Chicken Shit."
And what if I did it?
Well, I definitely couldn't
file you under "Chicken Shit, "
then, now, could I?
What's your name again?
- Stuntman Mike.
- Well, Stuntman Mike...
I'm Butterfly.
My friend Jungle Julia over here says
that jukebox inside is pretty impressive.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah.
Well, why don't you go
get ready for your lap dance?
I'm driving.
We are gonna go somewhere else,
gonna go hang out.
Ready to go?
Yeah.
- Bye.
BOTH: Bye.
I think you got Mike laid tonight.
Looking good, Cannonball Run!
He's just giving me a ride.
Oh, no doubt.
Have a nice ride!
Look, double fucks.
I am not gonna fuck him.
I can hear you.
- He's old enough to be my dad.
- I can still hear you.
Bye.
Bye-bye!
Wow, that's fucking scary.
Yeah, well, I wanted it
to be impressive and...
scary tends to impress.
Is it safe?
No, it's better than safe.
It's death-proof.
How do you make a car death-proof?
Well, that's what stuntmen do.
You have seen a movie where
a car gets into some smash-up
there ain't no way in hell
any body's walking away from?
Yeah.
Well, how do you
think they accomplish that?
- CGI?
-
Well, unfortunately, Pam, nowadays
more often than not, you are right.
Tsk. But back
in the all-or-nothing days...
'Vanishing Point' days,
the 'Dirty Mary Crazy Larry' days,
the 'White Line Fever' days...
real cars smashing into real cars.
Real dumb people driving them.
So, give the stunt team
the car you want to smash up,
they take her and reinforce
that fucker everywhere and...
You got yourself
a death-proof automobile.
That makes sense. I just didn't know
you could make a car death-proof.
Well, I can drive this baby into
a brick wall doing 125 miles an hour.
Just for the experience.
Why is your passenger seat in a box?
Well, this is a movie car.
Sometimes when you are shooting a crash,
director wants to put a camera in the car--
you know, shoot the crash
from the inside.
That's where you put the camera.
They call it a "crash box."
- There you go.
-
You know, when you
asked to drive me home,
you didn't mention your car
didn't have a passenger seat.
Yeah, well, actually,
I didn't ask to drive you home.
You asked me for a ride,
and I said, "Yes. "
But look at the bright side, Pam--
I won't be getting fresh,
putting my hand on your knee.
That is a bright side.
I thought so.
Well, Pam...
which way are you going?
- Left or right?
- Right.
Ah, that's too bad.
Why?
Well, because it was a 50/50 shot
on whether you would be going left or right.
You see, we are both going left.
You could have just
as easily been going left, too,
and if that was the case,
it would have been a while
before you started getting scared.
But since
you are going the other way,
I'm afraid...
you are gonna
have to start getting scared...
immediately.
What the fuck?!
Cock sucking motherfucker!
Just fucking let me out of here!
I will fucking rip your fucking--
Stop the fucking car!
Why are you being such a shit?
Okay.
Here's the thing.
I get it.
This... is all a joke.
A-hah! Super funny!
It's... really funny, Okay?
But, um...
You can stop now.
And, if-- if-- if-- if--
--If...
... if you just drop me off?
- I swear I won't say anything--
- Hey, Pam!
Remember when I said
this car was death proof?
Well, that wasn't a lie.
This car is 100% death proof.
Only to get the benefit of it, honey...
you really need to be sitting in my seat.
Now I gotta catch me
my other girlfriends.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick and Tich.
So, you got it?
Thanks, honey.
You are gonna play it next song, right?
Good boy.
Growl!
Bye-bye.
Who do you want to hear?
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.
Who?
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.
Who the fuck are they?
For your information,
Pete Townshend, at one point,
almost quit The Who,
and if he had,
he would have ended up in this group,
thus making it Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, Tich, and Pete.
And if you ask me,
he should have.
-
- That's my boy!

SHANNA: I want to hear
this part of the song louder!
Do you remember anything?
Uh... I... I don't remember.
EARL: Doctor Block.
WOMAN:
Self-restraints to Room 310.
Well. What's the patient's
prognosis, Dr. Block?
I don't really see
it's any of your business.
Come on now, Sis.
You just tell us.
How bad is he?
He got banged up real good.
Busted nose, broken collarbone,
smashed up his left index finger.
Is that it?
He was real lucky.
That will be all?
Well, that's more than enough,
and I wanna thank you, Dr. Block.
Son of a bitch.
So, Pop.
What do you think?
Well, Son Number One,
what I think is so goddamn ghoulish
I hesitate to speak it out loud.
Well, give it a shot.
Well, what we have here
is a case of vehicular homicide.
That ol' boy in there
murdered them pretty little gals.
I mean, he used a car, not a hatchet,
but they are dead just the same.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Not a goddamn thing.
D.A. says there ain't no crime here.
Every one of them gals was swimming
in alcohol and floating on weed,
and old Hooper in there
came out clean as a whistle.
Now, you actually think that he
premeditating murdered them gals?
Well, I can't prove it.
But since thinking don't cost nothing,
I can think it, and I do.
Yeah, but Pop, he got
pretty banged up himself.
Well, hell yeah,
he got banged up, but goddamn--
I mean, them pretty little gals in there
look like a goddamn giant
chewed them up and spit them out.
Did any of them survive?
Shit.
Two tons of metal,
flesh and bone
and plain old Newton--
they all princess died.
Why?
EARL: Well, I would guesstimate
it's a sex thing.
The only way I can figure it.
High-velocity impact,
twisted metal, busted glass,
all four souls taken
exactly the same time.
Probably the only way that diabolical
degenerate can shoot his goo.
Your timing couldn't be better, Zoe.
It just so happens we are all three
off-duty for the next three days.
Fucking hell! How does that happen?
I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup,
and she's off for the next three days.
There's no stunts being filmed
during that time so Kim's free,
and Lee's on a will-notify
for the next four days.
So how the hell's the shoot going?
Great. We are having the best time.
The director, Cecil Evans, is so much fun.
We are making the coolest movie
and partying all the time.
Hell, yeah. The next job
after this one is definitely gonna suck.
So let's hear it, ladies.
Set romances! Who's getting it off?
That would be Lee and Toolbox.
Oh, Toolbox!
Name sounds promising.
- He's a grip.
- What he is is a pervert.
Well, he just keeps sounding
better and better.
What's his perversion?
He likes to watch me pee.
# Lee is sitting on a toilet
and Toolbox is watching her pee #
# P-l-S-S-l-N-G #
Ooh!
Yeah, but not no more.
Now she's getting it on
with the Rock.
You had a one-off with the Rock?
Well, not the real Rock.
He's this electrician named Bruce.
And Kim started calling him the Rock,
'cause he kinda looks like the Rock,
so now we all just call him the Rock.
Kim, dick department.
Let's hear it!
Mm-mmm, no dick this trip.
I got a man.
- How long have you had this boyfriend?
- About three months.
Who would you steal him from?
Nobody!
ABBIE: Kim!
- Wha--what?
He totally had a girlfriend.
ZOE: All of Kim's boyfriends start out
as somebody else's boyfriend.
I did not steal him!
I didn't steal any of them;
they just... jumped ship.
- So what's your story, Abernathy?
- Oh, Abbie's got the big Kahuna.
I had a set crush on Cecil.
Set crush? Nigga, please.
You were his set wife!
"Were" and "had" being
the key words, here.
Bitch, you two are still
into each other and you know it.
Yeah, well, if he's so in love with me,
why did he fuck Darryl Hannah's stand-in?
Yes, men are dogs.
Oh, it's so funny!
Oh, it's so funny!
Stop acting all hurt.
Your ass just mad.
Yeah, he's a stand-in fucker.
Bitch, You need to get over that shit.
That was two weeks ago.
Oh, well, now you put it like that...
Oh, I haven't told you the best part.
He fucked her on my birthday.
Oh, that's a horse of a different color.
- Thank you.
- Did he know it was your birthday?
I mean, he's the director.
He's kind of busy.
He ate a piece of my birthday cake,
and he got me a present.
-  Wow.
- Yeah... I think he knew.
What did he get you?
He made me a tape.
He made you a tape?
-
- Wait, he didn't burn you a CD?
He made you a tape?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is so romantic!
Yes, I know what you are gonna say,
so don't even go there.
This sounds like the test
of true love to me.
Look, I know you guys like him.
He's likeable.
But he fucked another woman
on my birthday.
How can you not be on my side?
I admit, that sounds bad.
It is bad!
It just sounds like there's
a little more to it than that.
Were you two fucking?
Hell, no.
Hello, is your name Abernathy?
Sorry.
The answer to your question
is no, of course not.
What do you mean "No, of course not"?
The reason Cecil hasn't had
a girlfriend in six years
is because girls will fuck him,
and if you fuck Cecil,
you don't become one
of his girlfriends--
not to say I want to be his girlfriend,
but if I did want to be his girlfriend,
if I fucked him, I wouldn't be.
I would be one of his regulars,
and I'm getting too fucking old for that shit.
- Have you let him do anything?
- Yes!
I have let him give me a foot massage,
and when we go to the movies,
I have let him hold my hand.
Bitch, you might be acting
like you 12 years old,
but he just acting like a man.
You need to break
that nigga off a piece.
Let me get this straight--
you are not fucking him,
you are not sucking him,
you are not giving him any tongue,
but Darryl Hannah's stand-in is?
You know some cultures might say
he made the wiser choice.
So Zoe, Kim, and I are
in the Philippines at an outdoor rave.
- LEE: What were you working on?
- Three Kicks to the Head. Part Three.
And, admittedly,
we are a little fucked up.
- ZOE:
- Word.
Cheers.
So Zoe...
the genius, wants to take
a picture of me.
It's dark as hell,
and you can't see shit.
So she's got her camera
and keeps saying, "Step back a little!"
So I do.
Then "A little fu -ther!"
So I step back a little fu -ther.
Then "A little more!" So I do.
Then I realize I'm at the edge
of a seven-foot concrete ditch...
... with God knows how many rocks
and broken bottles and rats in it,
and if I fell in that fucking thing,
I probably would have broken my neck.
So I am yelling at her:
"Zoe, you almost killed me!"
So we laugh about it
and walk a little further,
and Zoe starts fucking around.
And... bam!... if she doesn't fall
in the fucking ditch!
LEE: Nice.
Thank you. Yep. Thank you.
I remember taking a step
and looking down,
just as I'm thinking, "There's that ditch
Abbie was talking about. "
Bam! I'm in the fucking ditch, you know.
What happened?
What, with Zoe, the cat?
Nothing.
If I fell in that fucking thing, they would
have had to helicopter me out of there.
Zoe just lands on her feet.
But then later I started feeling
a little bad about myself--
Zoe falls in the ditch and it's nothing.
We are laughing about it.
If I fell in that fucking thing,
I probably would have been paralyzed.
Oh, honey, you can't think like that.
We all have our individual talents,
and that just happens to be one of Zoe's.
Well, physically speaking,
Zoe is amazing.
I mean, agility, reflexes, nimbleness?
There's few human beings that can fuck
with Zoe on that front.
Kim, I like you too.
Having said that, before you get
too envious of Zoe's prowess,
you are missing the most
important part of that story.
You didn't fall in the ditch.
Zoe did.
Zoe even knew there was a ditch there
because you told her,
and she still fell in.
So Lee's right.
We all have our talents.
Hey, I resemble that remark.
So Kim, you still pack a Roscoe?
Check it out, bitch.
- Ooh, nice one, mate.
- I know this.
LEE: What's a Roscoe?
Roscoe's a pistol.
- You carry a gun?
- Uh-huh.
You have a license to carry?
Yeah, when I became a Secret Service
agent, they gave me a license.
Oh, I didn't know you were...
Okay, I didn't say it, all right?
Stop looking at me. God.
Did you know Kim carried a gun?
Yes. Now, do I approve? No.
Do I know? Yes.
Look, I don't know what
futuristic utopia you live in,
but the world I live in,
a bitch need a gun.
You can't get around the fact
that people who carry guns
tend to get shot
more than people who don't.
And you can't get around the fact
that if I go down to the laundry room
at midnight enough times,
I might get my ass raped.
Don't do your laundry at midnight.
Fuck that! I wanna do my laundry
whenever the fuck I want to.
There are other things you can carry
other than a gun. Pepper spray.
Uh, motherfucker trying to rape me,
I don't want to give him a skin rash.
I wanna shut that nigga down!
How about a knife, at least?
Yeah, you know what happens
to motherfuckers carry knives?
They get shot!
If I ever become a famous actress,
I won't carry a gun.
I will hire me a do-dirt nigga and he will
carry the gun, and when shit goes down,
I will sit back and laugh,
but until that day, it's Wild West.
So Zoe, you thought about
what you want to do first?
It just so happens
I know exactly what I want to do.
Oh, really?
And what would that be?
To me, there's no point in being in America
unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car.
I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger--
fuck me swinging, balls out.
ABBIE: Well, I guess we
could talk to Transpo,
but does it have to be
a Dodge Challenger?
Not just that. It has to be a 1970
Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine.
How in the fuck
do you expect to do that?
No worries, mate.
I have got it all worked out.
When I knew I was coming here,
I went on-line and found out
that the local paper here in Tennessee
is the Lebanon News Sentinel.
- So back home...
- I'm sorry, where's home? Australia?
What do you mean by that, mate?
Zoe's from New Zealand,
and you never--
I repeat, never--
call a Kiwi an Aussie.
KIM: That is, unless
you want your ass kicked.
I'm so sorry. I will nev--
Oh, it's okay.
We are just taking the piss
out of you, mate.
Auckland, to answer your question.
Anyway, I subscribed
to the local paper a month ago.
Why the fuck you want a local redneck
newspaper in New Zealand?
Pipe down and I will tell you.
I have been getting the paper
and checking the classifieds,
looking at cars for sale,
so as of yesterday,
for sale in this town,
some dude is selling
a stock 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a 440 engine and a white paint job.
KIM: And you wanna buy it?
Kim, I may be stupid,
but I'm not bloody stupid.
I wanna say I wanna buy it
so he will let me test-drive it.
A 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a white paint job?
Oh, uh, Kowalski!
Kowalski from 'Vanishing Point'.
Mate, it's a fucking classic!
If I can get this guy
to let me drive it without him,
I will blow the doors off that bitch.
ABBIE: What's 'Vanishing Point'?
What's 'Vanishing Point'?
Abs, I'm supposed
to be the illiterate one.
It's just one of the best
American movies ever made.
Actually, Zoe, most girls
wouldn't know 'Vanishing Point'.
Excuse me. Most girls?
What the fuck are you two?
Yeah, well, we are gearheads.
Of course we watched it.
Y'all grew up watching
that 'Pretty in Pink' shit.
Oh, I liked 'Pretty in Pink'.
What, so you didn't watch
John Hughes movies?
Of course I did. I'm a girl.
But I also watched car shit, too...
'Vanishing Point'. 'Dirty Mary Crazy Larry'.
- 'Gone in 60 Seconds'...
- Oh...
The real one, not that
Angelina Jolie bullshit.
We have an outdoor theater in Auckland
that plays 'Vanishing Point'.
'Big Wednesday'. all the classics.
What do you horny gals want?
Yeah, you got
a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale?
Right up here, ladies.
This shit is off the fucking hook!
Fucking legendary, mate.
Sweet ass. Well, if you will excuse me,
I would like to have a word with my associate.
You ladies take your time.
What are you waiting for?
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself.
I intend to, but first I need
to ask you something.
What?
If he lets us take it out on our own,
I wanna play Ship's Mast.
- Oh, hell, no!
- Keep it down!
Ain't no way I'm doing Ship's Mast.
- For Chrissakes...
- Don't blaspheme.
Sorry.
Now, what did you say
after the last time?
- Look, I know what I said.
- What did you say?
- I know I said we shouldn't...
- No.
You didn't say we shouldn't.
You said we ain't ever gonna do that again.
- But...
- But, my ass!
You said not only are we never
gonna play Ship's Mast again,
but you also said if you ever do
what you trying to do now,
to not only refuse, but that I had permission
to physically restrain your ass if necessary.
Now, did you or did you not say that?
No, no, no.
Answer the question, motherfucker.
- Did you or did you not say that?
- Yes, I said that.
- However...
- Whatever with your "however."
Look, I know I said it,
and I know I meant it--
Damn skippy you meant it!
But when I said it,
I didn't mean in America!
- Oh, nigga, please.
- For real. Really.
I meant we should never play Ship's Mast
again in New Zealand or Australia.
You are such a liar!
I know what I said, but when I said it
I didn't know I would ever come to America,
and if I had of known
I was gonna come to America,
had the opportunity to play Ship's Mast
on the 'Vanishing Point' Challenger...
I would have added a "however. "
Right?
Okay, oddly enough,
I actually understood that.
However, just because
you talked yourself into some stupid shit
doesn't mean I have lost
my goddamn mind.
You need two people to play Ship's Mast,
and I ain't playing.
I will be your best friend.
I don't need me no best friend
lives on the other side of Planet Earth.
I will crack your back.
You will crack it anyway.
Well, of course I will crack it anyway.
But now, while I'm here,
I will be your back-cracking slave.
Whenever you want it, you have got it.
You don't even have to ask.
You just order me to do it, just be like,
"Bitch, get over here and get busy."
We are gonna see if this guy will let us
take the car out without him.
If he does, you wait here with Lee
and we will be back in a moment.
What?
- I said we are gonna see if this guy will let--
- I heard what you said.
I just can't believe
what you said.
You two got some fucking balls.
What?
Don't play dumbass with me.
I have been up all night, I'm still a little drunk,
and I have a hangover.
I should be in my hotel room, asleep,
not fucking around on Tobacco Road,
but because Zoe wanted to drive
some 'Vanishing Point' car, I'm here.
Now you two got the balls to ask me--
no, scratch that-- tell me
I gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad
while the cool kids get to go out and play?
Bullshit on that.
- It ain't like that.
- What's it like, Kim?
You guys are our collateral.
He's never gonna go for it if we all go.
I really think one human being
will be collateral enough.
You are not gonna
want to do what we are doing.
What, drive a car?
We are doing more than that.
What, drive it fast?
We are doing more than that.
Actually, we are paying you a compliment,
'cause we gonna do some stupid shit.
But that's okay. We are stunt people.
We ain't got good sense.
But you got good sense,
and anybody with good sense
- ain't gonna want to do what we are doing.
- How do you know?
'Cause you are a mum.
Yeah.
You know, we are supposed
to be this big posse,
but that's the excuse you guys use
whenever you want to exclude me,
so what is it you two daredevils are doing
that I'm just so uncool
I couldn't possibly understand?
You know, we are kind of conning this guy,
so maybe it's best if we don't go
into detail about it while he's watching us.
Besides...
he's probably not gonna
let us do it, anyway.
Okay, how about this?
I will talk him into it,
but I go along.
- How you gonna do that?
- That's my problem.
But don't worry.
He will say yes.
What are you gonna do, blow him?
No.
I'm gonna insinuate
that Lee's gonna blow him.
That's a good one.
Not really.
But let me handle it.
We got a deal?
Okay, Mama, listen up.
You wanna hang with the cool kids?
You got to be cool.
We take you along, you don't say shit.
You don't even say crap.
You just sit in the back, and I don't want
to hear a peep, you understand?
- Got it.
- I'm serious, now.
You start nagging us, we pulling over,
kicking you out, and picking you up later.
Agreed.
Okay. Go work your magic.
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.
- Hello, what's your name?
- Jasper.
Hello, Jasper, I'm Abernathy.
- Aber what?
- Abernathy.
- What's your first name?
- That is my first name.
- What kind of first name is that?
- Just call me Abbie.
Okay, Abbie.
Jasper, we were wondering
if my friends and I could take the car out
for a little test drive out on our own,
just to see if we are comfortable.
Why would I do something
stupid like that?
To better sell your automobile.
How do I know y'all ain't
just gonna steal it?
Four reasons, actually.
One, we are not thieves,
two, that would be rude,
three, we are staying
at the Days Inn in town--
you can call, check with management.
We are registered for the next month.
Actually, Zoe's not, but Kim and I are,
so we are totally track-downable.
Who's Kim? The colored girl?
Yes. Kim would be the girl of color.
And reason number four--
and the most important:
while we are taking the car out
for a little spin,
that will give you a better opportunity
to get acquainted with our other friend...
Lee.
Why does she look
kind of familiar?
That would be because
she's a famous actress.
Hmm.
Why's she dressed like that?
Well, you see, we are making
a Hollywood movie in town,
and it's a cheerleader movie,
and she's one of the cheerleaders.
What's a cheerleader movie?
A movie about cheerleaders.
Is it a porno movie?
Yes, it is, but don't mention it. She's shy.
Lee, this is Jasper.
Jasper, Lee.
Now, you two kids
stay out of trouble.
KIM: Hey, good-looking.
Be back to pick you up later.
ZOE: Ta-ta!
Gulp.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
I think I'm thinking it.
What are you and you thinking?
I'm thinking we told your ass
to shut the fuck up.
- Where y'all going?
- You stay put.
I gotta take a--
So, you ready to do this?
You sure?
Well, I always don't want to do it
right before I'm gonna do it.
I know what you mean,
'cause I don't wanna do it.
Kim!
- I'm just saying.
- If you are gonna take the piss out of it...
I'm just saying.
You wanna start out on top?
Practically doesn't count
if you start on the top.
Here are your gloves.
No, no, no, no.
I'm wearing a jacket.
This is my jacket.
Um, ain't you supposed to be
my slave or some shit?
- Come on.
- I'm the one who's on the bonnet.
Bonnet, my ass.
You on the hood.
Y'all, I think I hear a car coming.
Give me your belt.
This is my cute shit.
Fuck that. Get Abernathy's belt.
Fine, we will use Abbie's belt.
- Give me your belt.
- No. Prada.
Come on, give her the belt.
- Magic word.
- Please give her the belt?
Just 'cause you asked nicely.
It's nice to be nice, Kim!
Whatever.
You know what?
Don't think about asking me to do your hair.
- Your ass gonna do it.
- You will ask "pretty please, " bitch,
because that's what you do when no one
else is looking. You ain't that hard.
- I ain't getting...
- Abernathy.
Don't get on my nerves right now.
- I got shit on my mind.
- ZOE: Ooh!
You know, I ain't six.
It's cold. Can we roll up
one of these windows?
KIM and ZOE: No.
Okay, Abernathy. Check this out.
What the fuck are you guys doing?
ABBIE: What does that mean?
Whoa!
Faster, you black bitch! Faster!
That fast enough for your bony ass?
Whoo-hoo!
Whoa ho ho ho!
Oh!
Abernathy, get your ass up here.
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!
Alrighty.
ABBIE: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
ZOE: Go, go! Go!
Check it out, bitch.
You want it fucking faster?
Whoo-hoo!
Yah hoo hoo!
##
Yah hoo hoo!
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck? Shit.
Damn it!
Now.
Did you do something to him?
Say something?
Nothing! Shit.
Here he comes, Zoe.
He's coming!
Aah!
Shit, oh shit!
No!
Hold on, Zoe!
Oh, my God. Zoe!
- Oh! Hold on!
- I can't!
Fuck you, motherfucker!

- I forgive you. Hold the fuck on!

I'm really scared.
I know, baby, just hold on.
Watch your feet!

- Fucking son of a bitch!

Then suck on this for a while, bitch!
ABBIE: Zoe! Goddamn it!
Oh, my God. Get away from us,

Leave us alone!
ZOE: Fuck you, motherfucker!
- KIM: Fuck you!
ABBIE: Zoe! Zoe! Oh, Zoe!
Hold on!
Zoe! Zoe!
Look out!
Get ready to fly, bitch.
- Zoe!
- Zoe, hold on!
He's right on your fucking ass!
Hey! Whoo-hoo!
Hey, ladies, that was fun.
Well, adios.

- Ow! Fuck!
Shit! Fuck!
Run away with your ass!
You better run, motherfucker!
That bitch!
I'm okay!
Oh, shit! Goddamn it!
Oh, you fucking bitch!
Of course you are.
Of course you are. What was I thinking?
What was I thinking?
Zoe, the fucking cat!
Whew. That was a close one.
You guys look like shit.
Who died?
That's it!
- I'm gonna beat your fucking ass.
- Zoe, are you Okay?
Well, I'm gonna have a
hell of a bruise on my bum but...
... aside from that I will be sweet.
So, where's the maniac?
I shot him and his punk ass sped off.
You wanna go get him?
Oh, hell yeah!
Honey...
I think you might want to get out.
Fuck that shit.
Let's kill this bastard.
Okay, get your ass in the back.
