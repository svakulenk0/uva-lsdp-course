Mother!
Gotcha!
All right,
... you're asking for it!
- One more step and...
... you're gonna get it!
Parental abuse!
- I'll quit if you quit.
- Truce?
Truce.
Help your old mother up.
I had my fingers crossed!
You're gonna be very sorry...
Don't do that!
Not as sorry as you!
Jerry's home!
Come on.
Come on, honey...
"Jerry's home"
Yeah!
Excuse me, lady,
is this the Blake residence?
- It is.
Stephanie home?
She's in the backyard.
- I've got a surprise for her.
- What?
- Something no family should
be without. - What is it?
Stephanie!
There's somebody I'd like you
to meet.
I can't tell you what his name is,
because he doesn't have one yet.
Names don't seem to matter much.
I had a dog when I was a kid.
He was just a mutt, but to
me, he was Rin Tin Tin.
Rin Tin Tin?
Well, that was a little before
your time, I guess.
So, what do you think? Can we
give this little guy a home?
- Sure.
- That's my girl...
I'll go inside and call Karen
to tell her about the puppy.
- Honey... What do you say?
- Thanks, Jerry!
I gotta fix that screendoor
one of these days...
I hope she doesn't think I was
trying to buy her love.
- Maybe the puppy was a mistake.
- The puppy was perfect.
You're perfect!
Give her some time.
It'll be fine.
I know... All takes time!
And time is one thing I got
plenty of.
I feel like I'm watching a
tennis match.
Stephanie, why don't you ease in
for a landing?
I'll stop pacing if you stop
doodling.
All right, you pace, I'll doodle,
and we'll both be happy.
We were... talking about your
father.
My father died a year ago.
Sorry, I meant your stepfather.
If my father hadn't died,
there wouldn't be a stepfather.
You're mad at him for dying.
I'm mad at somebody!
Being unable to accept your
father's death...
... is part of the reason you've
been getting into trouble.
I'm not in that much trouble.
Suspended three times last year...
Twice this year, and school's
barely been in session two months.
I know what my problem is.
Him.
If he wasn't here,
my Mom and I would be alright.
Steph,
you're going to have to
face the fact...
... that your mother loves
the guy.
She doesn't see!
Doesn't see what, Stephanie?
I think my time is up.
Isn't it?
So, how was your session?
OK.
Sweetheart, it seems like you
and I are always budding heads.
How about we try to get along
a little better?
Sure.
One more thing and then I'll
shut up.
It's very important to your
mother and to me...
... that you try to get along
better in school this year.
What do you say?
Stephanie, knock it off!
Girls, come on, stop it!
Enough!
It's the last time you cause
an outburst in my classroom.
Mr. Conroy! Stephie didn't
start it!
When I want your opinion, Baker,
I'll ask for it.
You couldn't have got yourself
in deeper trouble if you tried.
Well, Norah, what do you think?
- I love it!
- I knew you would.
And this is the south. You'll
have sun all day long.
- What do you think, pumpkin?
- I don't know...
Oh! One thing I forgot to
mention.
It comes with a swing set.
I have a daughter, too.
She's a few years older than you.
Her name is Stephanie.
She goes to Oakridge High,
which is where you'll be going
one of these days...
... after your parents buy
the house.
- What grade are you in, Cindy?
- Third.
Third grade... !
I remember when Jill was in
third grade.
I used to walk her home from
school every day.
- Who's Jill?
- That's my daughter.
You said her name was Stephanie.
Right, Stephanie.
She goes to Oakridge High.
She's on the student council.
She's a straight A's student.
I'm very proud of her.
- Suspended again?
- Expelled.
No! What're you gonna do?
Maybe boarding school.
- Really?
- I'm sure gonna try for it.
What's your stepfather gonna
do when he finds out?
He's gonna kill me.
Expelled? You're kidding.
Principal said it wasn't
working out.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Girls don't get expelled.
All right, it's over...
The damage is done...
Now...
What are we gonna do about
the future?
I wanna go to a boarding
school.
You wanna leave home?
It's not a family without
children.
I think it'd be best for
everybody.
Best for everybody?
Running away would be best for
everybody?
It's not running away!
Well,
Jerry, what do you think?
I don't think we have to break up
the family, do we, pumpkin?
Father knows best.
Karen, it's freaky, the way he
looks at me...
... like he wanted to erase me
off the face of the earth.
I'm sure.
Ok, don't believe me.
Ok, so, what's the verdict?
Is Scary Jerry gonna let you
go to a boarding school?
I don't know. He has his own fantasy
we should be like families on TV.
Grin and laugh, and have fewer
cavities all the time...
It's like having Ward Cleaver
for a Dad.
I gotta hang. Firing squad has
arrived. Bye.
Come in.
So, where's my blindfold?
What blindfold?
I thought the condemned person
always got a blindfold.
You don't really wanna leave
home... do you, honey?
Yes, I do.
It isn't our house anymore...
... it's his!
Of course it's our house.
It's always been our house.
I loved your father,
and when he died I thought:
"Well, maybe that's it.
Maybe you only get one chance
to be happy. "
I never thought I'd love anybody
that much again.
I know, Mom.
I miss him so bad...
I know you do, honey.
We have a second chance with
Jerry.
He's a wonderful man.
And he wants to care for us.
Can't you just...
... give him a chance?
I'm trying.
I'm really trying hard!
There's just something
about him.
- Well, what is it?
- I don't know! I just...
I hope you're not still upset...
... over this school business.
We were just talking about that.
Everything will look clearer
in the morning, uh?
We'll work it out.
Good night, sweetheart.
Good night, Mom.
Sweet dreams, Steph.
G' night, Jerry.
Wilbur, will you turn the page
for me?
Turn it yourself. You've
got a tongue.
I tried it yesterday and swallow
the comic section.
OK, I'll be quiet as a
church mouse.
I used to love this show
when I was a kid.
It wasn't till I got in high school
I realized horses couldn't talk.
- I bet you were cute back then.
- Yeah...
I'd like to see a picture of you.
You would, wouldn't you?
You never talk about your past.
I didn't even exist until
I met you.
Past is important.
Don't try to touch the past.
It isn't real.
It's just a dream.
The only reality is...
... this moment.
You and me.
Here and now.
What are we doing here?
This is the house where Henry
Morrison murdered his family.
Do you think I don't remember
that?
I was here that night.
I never wanna see anything
like that again.
Yeah, I know. A friend of mine
sent me your article.
I was in Europe at that time.
It took 9 months for me to get it.
Cops did never really catch
the guy.
File's inactive. I think it
should be reopened.
Yeah, well... Talk to the cops.
I'm just a reporter.
Well, I talked to the cops.
They can give a shit.
Listen to me a minute, alright?
Three weeks before Morrison
killed them...
... he quit his job, didn't
tell anybody.
Got up every morning, pretending
he'd go to work,
and came home at the
same time every night.
So how far could he go every day...
... and still get back at the same
time every night? Look at this.
It has to be...
... somewhere within this radius.
See, what I think...
... is that during that time he was
setting himself up a new life,
somewhere close by.
- What do you want from me?
- Just this:
do a follow up story, right?
You run a picture of Morrison.
Your paper circulates in this area.
Someone might recognize him and if
they do, Brennan, you're a hero.
Why are you chasing this?
Vicky Morrison's maden name
was Ogilvie.
She was my sister.
Oh... Jesus!
I'm sorry, Ogilvie, uh?
Ok, I'll do what I can, right?
OK.
This place is mine now.
You wanna go inside?
Fuck no!
I'll take him.
Everybody! Everybody!
Jerry is gonna make a speech!
I guess you all know why I
asked you here.
'Cause when I first started with
American Eagle Realty, a year ago,
you were the first five families
I sold houses to.
Yeah, Jerry, I've been meaning to
ask you about my garage door.
It would still work if you wouldn't
have gotten your car into it.
We met doing business and we
stayed to become friends.
And although I may be arguing
against the comission here,
don't sell your houses 'cause
I like being your neighbor.
I wanna get a picture with my
family. Steph! Susan!
Come here! Come on down.
Yeah! Come here.
Yeah, come on!
- Come on, Steph.
- Oh, I don't know...
There we are... OK.
This is as good as it gets!
I hope you don't think what
I'm gonna say is pretencious.
I sell houses, that's my job,
but sometimes I think it's more
than that... I truly believe
... that what I sell is the
American Dream.
You can call me sentimental,
I don't care.
When I came here I was
a stranger,
but I never felt more at home
anywhere in my life.
I have beautiful friends,
I have a wonderful new family...
Have a good time. Thanks
for coming.
Look at this. They'd print
anything to make a buck.
- It's just simple sensation.
- What's that, Herb?
That guy in Bellvue who killed
his whole family.
Cut'em up with knives.
I don't think I know about that.
It happened last year, that's
what I was talking about.
This thing is a year old and they
go waking it up again.
This is terrible.
Jerry...
Jerry?
You're alright?
This kind of thing really gets
to me, you know?
That a man could be driven to do
something like that to his family?
to his children?
I don't even wanna know
about it.
Makes you wonder though...
What's it take to make a guy...
... do such a thing?
Maybe they disappointed him.
Hey, I thought this was
supposed to be a party.
Hey, Tommy! Tommy, come here!
- You're Black Beard, the Pirate.
- Thank you, Mr. Blake.
Aye aye, Captain.
Steph, honey, would you go down
and get the ice cream, please?
All we need is a little order
around here!
Order!!
You're a good boy. You're
Daddy's little angels.
Why don't they just leave
me alone?!
Let me out! Let me out!
We're gonna keep this family
together.
You had better believe it!!
Hi, honey.
Oh, the ice cream.
Honey,
you know how it is.
Being a salesman, smiling all
the time, you know-Sometimes I,
have to let off some steam,
you know?
You know how it is.
Sure. I gotta get back or Mom
is gonna wonder where I'm at.
Steph,
things like these don't happen.
It happened to them.
Let me see if I follow your
thinking.
A man murdered his family.
You hate Jerry.
Therefore, Jerry is the man
who murdered his family.
Yeah... that all adds up.
Karen, maybe Jerry isn't the guy...
but you don't know him like I do,
or see him down in the basement.
And guess when Jerry showed up
in town and met my Mom?
Right after this!
So, what are you going to do,
Nancy Drew?
I'm writing this letter to
the "Seattle Examiner",
and ask them to send me a picture
of Henry Morrison.
I told them I'm in a project
about mass murders.
Off the deep end...
Give me a break.
You didn't run his fucking
picture!
- How is anyone gonna identify him?
- Get your hands off of me!
My editor didn't want the picture
not me, huh!
I almost didn't get the article
on the paper at all!
What do you want from me? I just
work here, I don't make policy.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I don't want this to happen
again. Almost gave me a coronary.
Here.
And this is a job for
professionals, Ogilvie.
You're just one man.
Why don't you get on with the rest
of your life? Forget about it!
You saw what he did to 'em.
Can you forget about it?
Mom says you only charge half
of your regular fees to see me.
How come you do that?
My 3 o'clock pacient is
schizophrenic. I charge him double.
All works out.
Besides, I like seeing you.
You were gonna tell me your idea.
I wanna go to a boarding school.
Don't say it's running away.
- What's the matter with running
away? - It's just that...
- What?
- Sometimes running away is the best.
It gives everybody some breathing
room, right?
Right.
What do your folks say?
I think I can talk my Mom into it.
And what about... ?
He has this crazy thing about
breaking up the family.
If you saw this man, you would
say: "Commit him".
You probably are driving
him crazy
to a certain extent.
- Yeah...
Why don't I have a talk with him?
If you could be on my side...
I  on your side.
I'll give your father...
Sorry.
I'll give...  a call.
You're home awfully early.
Hi, honey, I run out of
appointments.
Anything for me?
As a matter of fact, something
did come for you.
Well, can I have it?
I don't know...
What do you mean?
I don't know if it's the kind of
thing you should be looking at.
I'm just kidding. Here you go.
Ohh... My sweet little thing.
My sweet little bitch.
That's my good girl.
Yes, you are daddy...
Jerry, honey!
Yes?
Dinner in 15 minutes.
Okay...
Where did you go?
Oh, yeah...
Ahhh... That's my baby.
I'm sorry.
Hello?
Hi, Dr. Bondurant.
Jerry?
Dr. Bondurant is on the phone
for you.
What does he want?
He wants you to come in for
a talk.
Tell him I'm not here.
- Why don't you just come up and
talk to him?
I'm not here!
And if he calls back, tell him
I'm  not here.
Er... Jerry can't come to the
phone right now.
Could I have him call you back?
-
- Thank you.
I take it you're the guy
that called me... Ogilvie?
I'm Lieutenant Wall.
You're in my parking space.
I figured this way you'd have to
talk to me about Henry Morrison.
For starters, Morrison isn't his
real name.
- Well, what is it?
- God only knows, we don't.
His personal history was falsified
and his prints were untraceable.
We talked to a criminal
psychologist
who proposed a possibility
you might be interested in.
He said it was possible that
Morrison had done it before.
Married into an existing family,
something upsets him and wipes 'em out.
You knew him,
What do you think?
I think it's better than a
possibility.
What do you plan to do about it?
For the moment, nothing.
We don't have a single lead.
The guy is smart!
We won't have anything to go on
unless he does it again.
You're gonna wait until he gets to
another family and butchers them?
You're not hearing me!
We've got nothing!
Zilch!
Lieutenant,
if you were me, what would you do?
Just between the two of us?
I'd get a gun and blow the son
of a bitch away.
How do you do, Mrs. Leitner?
- I'm Jerry Blake.
- How do you do? Please sit down.
I've come to talk about the
situation with Stephanie.
I'm afraid, Mr. Blake,
it's a lost cause.
Well... I'm sort of a believer
in lost causes.
OK.
I guess I have to face it.
Jerry Blake is the most wonderful
man in the world.
He got you back into school,
didn't he?
You know why, don't you?
To get out of seeing you.
Did it ever ocurred
to you that maybe...
it isn't the rest of
the world that's wrong?
I told you how phony he is, and
how he acted in the basement
... making faces at himself.
- Oh, come on! We all do that.
Why did he freak out and...
absolutely refused
to come and see you?
Because he's afraid
of my eagle eye?
It's more than that.
He scares me, Dr. Bondurant.
I'm afraid of him!
Jerry Blake here.
Which house was that?
Yes, sir, I'd be happy
to show you that house, Mr...
Martin?
Fine! I'll see you then.
So, are you gonna be
coming back to art class?
No. They put me
in typing instead.
What a waste! You've got
a lot of artistic talent.
- Get out of here!
- No, really, I mean it.
You'd have a great future
as a big shirt designer.
I really liked the one
you made for Mr. Conroy.
The green hand print was great!
If I buy my own paints, would you
make one like that for me too?
No, but I might
do it to your face.
All right... Give it to me,
give me that shot. Come on!
Maine she takes a jab!
Baker shots her jaws!
Maine pounds at his
middle section!
Baker gets her to the corner!
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.
- Sure, great.
- Well, bye.
- Bye.
- Hi, sorry I'm a little late.
- No problem, no problem.
- Ray Martin.
- Hi, Ray. Jerry Blake.
- It's a great house.
- Wait till you see inside. Come.
- Come on in.
- Big mirror in the hall.
And lot of closets in here.
It's great. Kitchen back here?
Yes, it's back here, yeah.
I forgot to tell you,
lovely hardwood floors.
Look at the inlaid.
It's terrific.
- Right, very nice.
- I'll show you the bedroom.
Lot of space here.
Lot of room for kids.
You a family man, Ray?
Confirmed bachelor.
How about you, Jerry?
Happily married. I wouldn't
trade it for the world.
I don't know... I think
it just works for some guys.
What's that?
You know, the family, home
sweet home, all that crap.
What line of work are you in, Ray?
If you don't mind my asking.
Oh! Not at all!
I'm in stress management.
Sounds complicated.
The kitchen has been remodeled.
Built-ins. I like this.
I try to find ways for employers
and employees to get along better.
I ask questions,
they give me answers.
For instance: How do you sleep
at night?
How do you sleep at night, Jerry?
- I sleep like a baby.
- See, that's interesting.
Because I think there'd be a lot
of stress in your line of work.
I suppose there's a certain degree
of stress in every job, Ray.
It depends on how you handle it.
Which way am I facing?
North.
Come on in here, Ray. Great big
room for kids to tumble around in.
You know, a house like this should
really have a family in it.
You mean you won't sell it to me
because I don't have one?
Oh, no! I didn't say that.
This is all being remodeled here.
You really are a fan of traditional
values, aren't you, Jerry?
Tradition is important.
Sounds like you had
a strict up-bringing?
You might say that.
- Let me ask you a question, Ray.
- Sure.
Are you interested in
buying a house or in me?
Sorry.
Force of habit.
My wife gets on me
for that all the time.
I thought you said
you were a bachelor...
- Er... Recently divorced.
- I see.
Sometimes I forget
I'm not married anymore.
Probably it's just stress.
What are you-- ?
Who are you?
How did you get on to me?
I'm looking for--a house--
Oh, oh, oh...
I don't think this house
is right for you.
I think you'd be more comfortable
somewhere else.
This house is for a family!
You know what I mean?
A family...!?
... Home, sweet home?!
All that crap!!
OK.
It's alright.
A little order around here...
Just a little order, that's all.
A little order around here!!
Bondurant.
Dr. Bondurant?
Well,
Dr. Bondurant.
Rest in peace, doctor.
Come on, come on, Doctor.
Let's go.
All right, doctor.
We got to go...
... a little ride.
We'll take a little ride.
You seem disappointed he didn't
turn out to be Jack the Ripper.
I was wrong, Karen.
I was totally wrong.
Doctor.
Buckle up for safety.
Steph?
I'm sorry, honey. I have some
bad news about Dr. Bondurant.
His office just called.
What? I shouldn't go
to my hour tomorrow?
No, no. It's more
serious than that.
There was an accident sometime
last night up by the highway.
He-- lost control or something,
his car went off the road.
His car?
He's dead, Steph.
Sorry.
What happened?
Nobody knows.
Police say he lost
control of his car.
Just one of those stupid
unnecessary accidents.
He was my friend!
I know, baby.
He was a very special man.
In his own way, he helped
bring us together.
And nothing is ever
gonna split us apart.
Can I help?
Yeah, would you honey?
Thanks.
What do you think?
I like it!
Is it straight?
A little bit towards me.
Perfect!
- Jerry...
- Yeah?
I just wanna say that...
I know I've been a
lot of trouble.
And I'm sorry...
Well, let's say we owe each other
an apology and bury the hatchets.
Deal.
When I was a kid I went through
some pretty rough times myself.
So, what happened?
I outgrew my problems
and so will you.
Besides, you'll be too busy
checking boyfriends.
Boyfriends?
Yeah, you know...
Boys, girls, dating.
He's so old fashioned.
Aren't you?
Guilty as charged, Your Honor.
There's plenty of time
for that, sweetheart.
Don't try to grow up
too fast, huh?
OK.
It'll be nice with a family of
birds leaving in there.
Dear Lord,
we thank you for the meal
we're about to enjoy,
for our dear friends,
our wonderful home,
but most of all, Father,
we thank you for bringing us
together as a family.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Oh... sweetheart,
everything looks absolutely
perfect.
What do you think of this
turkey, Steph, huh?
Looks almost good enough to eat.
Yeah.
What do you say if we cut up
this bird? Steph?
Light or dark?
Wait, wait, wait, let me guess.
You're the...
... drumstick-type.
Two drumstick-type.
You know?
Until this moment,
I never realized what
Thanksgiving was all about.
Well, if it isn't
the Road Warrior!
- Come on, hop on.
- Looks dangerous...
- No, this bike is totally safe.
- I meant .
Me? You are the dangerous one,
you and that mean right hook.
Come on... Chicken.
Only if I get to drive.
So how come you're not with ever
popular Kathy Lombardo tonight?
Kathy Lombardo is a
stuck up bitch.
She dumped you!
No, no! I dumped her.
Alright, alright,
she dumped me.
Come on! Watch where
you're going. Easy.
We're OK now. You can stop
holding on so tight.
Do I have to?
Not if you don't want to.
- I walk you up.
- OK.
Well, thanks for the ride.
- It's your bike.
- Right.
Well...
- Good night.
- Good night.
I-I- guess I'll see you
in school, huh?
I guess so.
That's the Miller's dog.
Yeah.
Anyway-- er-- bye.
Bye...
You!
You could go to jail!
This girl is 16 years old!
- And so am I.
- Jerry. What's wrong?
This punk was trying
to rape our daughter!
I just kissed her good night!
Stephanie? What's going on?
- Go home, Paul!
- Steph, are you sure?
Go home and I'll talk to you
tomorrow...Go!
Would somebody please tell me
what this is all about?
He kissed me good night.
I wanted him to.
I like Paul, Mom!
- Of course you do, honey...
- She's still a child!
I'm not a child!
Just 'cause you're a crazy
demented about sex!
- Don't you talk to your father
that way!
- He's not my father.
He's just some crazy creep!
How can you even bare to...
... let him touch you?
- Stop it!
He's your father now and
you'll respect him!
Stephanie!
Stephanie, come back!
Let her go, Susan. She'll come
back when she calms down.
What were you thinking of...
... making such a stupid scene?
- That punk was undressing her!
That's Paul Baker. I've known him
longer than I've known you!
- Meaning what?
- All the progress we've made
with Stephanie thrown away,
just thrown away! by you!
I...
- Bye, Ron.
- Good luck. Take care.
- Good bye, Audrey, don't work
too hard, uh? - Good luck!
Bye Sylvia, thanks for everything.
- Bye everybody!
- Bye, Jerry!
- We'll miss you, Jerry.
- Thanks, Mr. Grace.
- Good luck.
- Thanks for everything. Good bye.
Just listen to me. All I'm saying
is that the guy just married again,
to a divorcee with kids or
a widow. I know him!
This guy can not live
without a family.
- Now, you gotta help me!
- I don't have time.
Come on! All I'm asking for are
copies of marriage certificates
for the last year. How much
time is that gonna take?
More time than I've got
or care to spare.
Come back in a couple of weeks.
- I need them now!
- Good bye...
- Asshole.
- You're not qualified.
- What?
- To call him asshole.
It's an earned privilege. You have
to know him for half an hour.
Well, perhaps you can help me
here, Miss... Barnes.
I could. The question is:
why should I?
Because the asshole wouldn't
like it, and I would.
What do you say, Miss Barnes?
I say...
... you're qualified to call
me Annie.
Ok.
Honey... honey!
They say this Dr. is one of the
best. Have a good session, huh?
Miss Maine?
Miss Stephanie Maine?
Sorry, wrong office.
- Mr. Meredith?
- Yeah, that's me.
Sorry to have bothered you.
Thanks.
Over here.
This house was supposed to be
empty. I'm sorry about that.
- Hi, I'm Bill Hodgkins.
- The man who phoned about the job?
- That's right.
- Roy Chesterton.
How'd you do?
- You ever sold insurance before?
- Back east in Pennsylvania.
If there's a policy I haven't sold
I'd like to know what it is.
Especialized in any one area?
Well, I'm pretty comfortable
in all of them but if I have a
personal crusade, it's family
related policies, life insurance.
That's a toughy. People don't
wanna think they're gonna die
- I know I don't.
- Death is always something
that happens to someone else.
That's why I really believe that
I'm protecting the family.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
That's our main objective here.
Jerry?
We have to talk, honey.
About what?
About what?
About what is happening
to our family.
I'm taking care of it.
By yourself?
Daddy is home!
Daddy is home!
- Daddy, Daddy!
- Look who's here!
- Yes?
- Hi! Is Gerald Blake home?
No. Was he supposed to show
you a house?
He sells houses?
Yes, he does.
Can I help you?
No, I'll just drop by later.
See, I'm not even sure it's
the same Gerald Blake.
Well, I can give him a
message for you.
No, that's okay.
If it's the guy I know, I'd
rather just surprise him.
- All right.
- Ok, thanks.
You're welcome.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm Bill Hodgkins. I've just
rented the house next door.
So, we're neighbors.
I'm Dorothy Reinhard.
Welcome to Madison St.
Thank you.
Hard work.
Oh, the kids were supposed to do
it, but... you know how kids are.
It's just you and the kids, then?
Yeah.
Jerry Blake, please?
I'm sorry but Mr. Blake is no
longer connected with this agency.
There must be some mistake.
No, there isn't. I can give you
his home number though. It's...
I know that number! I'm calling
from that number.
I'm sorry, Madam, but Mr. Blake
left several days ago.
Well, thank you very much.
- It's about time!
- Mrs. Fairfax?
Not for long. Put this in the
trunk. I'm leaving now!
Is this him? Is this the guy?
Sure, I'm having an affair
with the cab driver.
You let her in your cab and I'll
break every bone in your body!
- I'm not a cab driver, okay?
- OK.
I just wanna ask you a question.
You ever seen this guy before?
The beard's new, but he looks like
the guy who sold us this house.
- Muriel?
- Could be him.
He sells houses?
Yeah... that's right.
Hey, what the hell are you
doing, buddy?
Hi, honey.
Where've you been?
Showing the Morton house to
some folks from California.
- Don't lie to me, Jerry.
- What?
I called your office today.
I didn't get the message.
Of course you didn't. They said
you stopped working there...
... several days ago.
- What?
The recepcionist said
that you left!
That idiot!
That new girl can't...
Susan... I've never
got anyone fired in my life,
but that girl... I don't know...
- You mean you still work there?
Of course. Where else
would I be?
I don't know! I just-I don't
know what I thought. Sorry.
This is very upsetting. I hope
Grace is still there...
No, forget it, honey.
Forget it! She probably just--
got the name wrong or
something.
Hodgkins! What's to get wrong?
What did you say?
What?
Wait a minute...
Who am I here?
Jerry... !
Jerry?
Jerry Blake. Thank you, honey.
You're alright, sweetheart?
Jerry?
Where are you going?
Susan! Susan, come here!
Come here!
A little order around here, huh!
Come on, Rinnie.
Come on, Rinnie. Come on, fella.
Come on, come on...
Come on, fella, come on...
Come see me, come on...
Here boy, here boy.
Yeah! That's my little fella.
That's a good Rinnie,
that's a good Rinnie, yeah.
Oh, yes! Yeah, you're a good dog.
You're a good dog!
Mom?
Mom? you home?
Hey. What they do? Leave you
alone?
You're a very bad girl...
Come on, move!
Come on! Come on!
Jim...
Jim Ogilvie!
That's-- blood.
Next time, Jim,
call before you drop by.

hurt you.

Get out here!!

Come on, honey.
Where are you, Steph?
Come on, honey, it's alright.
It's all a game, Steph, uh?
Come on, Steph, it was all a...
... misunderstanding!!
No!
- No!! Please!!
- Come to Daddy! Come here!
- Come here!
- No!! Please!!
Stephanie!
Stephanie!!
Stephanie!

Mommy?
