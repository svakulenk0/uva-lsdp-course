BTSFilms - Always a Good Movie!
Uh...
Guy...
Guy...
Hey!
What the hell
are you doing up here?
The bathroom. I saw her.
There`s something wrong.
You`re a real
little Peeping Tom, aren`t you?
Get back to your room.
She fell. She`s hurt.
-
- Mrs. Baran!
I told you,
there`s something wrong.
And I told you
to get back to your room.
Now go.
Nicole.
Is she dead?
I don`t know.
I didn`t check.
Jesus, Guy!
Well, get her pills, for God`s sake.
She`s still alive.
Call 91 1 .
She needs a doctor.
Go get another teacher.
Move it!
I`m alive?
No. You`re dead,
this is heaven,
and I`m the Virgin Mary.
Can you swallow?
Yeah?
Here you go.
I don`t want them
to see me like this.
Did they say how long?
Erik... what happened?
It`s just her heart again.
Get the boy out of here.
Failure, despair, passivity,
rebelliousness, defeat...
why?
Well-meaning people
may offer dozens of theories,
all of them boiling down
to blaming you--the parent.
You won`t find
those theories here
at the St. Anselm School for Boys.
Poor little losers.
Aren`t you glad
you never did drugs?
You never did, right?
I think we should open
with the zero tolerance talk...
then the room searches.
Parents eat that shit up!
Man, you`d have to be
at the end of your rope
to wind up here.
We are here, dickhead.
Front steps in 1 0 minutes
for the video shoot.
And take your books home
over the long weekend.
There`ll be
a test on Tuesday.
Miss Horner?
I`ll be in a better mood
on Tuesday.
Yes, ma`am.
Don`t let Guy catch you.
He`s occupied.
You see? He didn`t
resist the urge
to assist another mother.
What happened to your eyes?
I don`t know what
you did to him last night,
but your husband was
in one of his moods again.
Thank you very much.
Nicole!
You shouldn`t be
seen with him.
They all know, Mia.
It`s better if we act normal.
That way,
it won`t look bad after.
Anyway, I only went over there
because the wife
chooses to sedate herself.
What if she notices they`re gone?
Oh, please.
That woman has enough drugs
over there to relax China.
Good morning, ladies!
Oh, God.
Are we ready
for our close-ups?
I can`t wait
for this filming to be done.
It just gets everyone
overexcited.
And your husband--
forgive me--
how he expects us
to handle more students
without having more staff--
Lovely seeing you last night.
Any time Estelle
and I can assist
you two star-crossed--
Is something
wrong with your eye?
Allergies.
Ah. I`m not surprised.
Well, if you don`t
quit for yourself,
think of us.
Secondhand smoke
does kill, too, you know.
Not reliably.
Thanks.
This is disgusting.
Hey, you going to eat that?
I`ve got to eat it.
I`m starving.
And then we thought
we`d cut to
a talking head of you,
you know, consequences,
a system kids can believe in,
blah, blah, blah, then
do talks with some of the kids.
I once was lost,
but now I`m found--
That classic Boys` Town stuff.
Success stories
are our specialty here.
As a matter of fact--
We want to get
some footage of the pool
once it`s cleaned.
I`m a poor man, guys.
As much as I`d like to,
I can`t afford to maintain
a pool all summer for show.
It`s just young boys frolicking,
sound minds and sound bodies,
the clean
Appalachian mountain air,
that type of thing.
O.K. We`ll skip it.
But we want to shoot
the kitchen work crew.
Yeah, take a number.
Hopkins, would you
take this away?
I`m not hungry.
Our chef`s skill
is not presentation.
I think you`ll find
it tastes better than it looks.
It would have to.
Peas mushy. Pepper.
Guy...you promised.
It`s a sin to waste.
Aren`t you the expert on sin?
No. You are.
Mia.
No one`s eating.
Well, don`t encourage them.
Use your great moral force
on my behalf.
Eat. It`s perfectly edible.
See?
Pick up your fork.
Just pick up your fork.
Pick it up.
Take some food
and put it in your mouth.
That didn`t kill you.
Now swallow.
Swallow it.
For God`s sake, Guy.
Swallow it
for once in your life.
Actually, I-- I`m afraid
I`m quite hungry myself,
so if you`re not
going to finish it--
Mr. Katzman,
will you please
tell the table proctors
that no student will be allowed
to leave this room
until every plate is clean.
Yes.
Thank you.
A child bride, gentlemen.
That`s what I married,
a child bride.
And each year,
she grows younger and younger.
She`s worse than
the boys she teaches.
You`re not finished yet.
Eat.
Again.
You know,
I think this might help.
Oh!
Look what I did.
Hopkins, could you
take this away, please?
Excuse me.
Wasn`t that fun?
Don`t you wish
you had that on tape?
Bet you`re just
kicking yourselves now, huh?
Excuse me.
I`m...
I`m sure Miss Horner will
keep something hot for you.
Mia?
Why do you make me
do that to you?
Why?
You always do it.
And you always will.
No, no, no.
Only when you misbehave.
Like that stunt
you pulled on Sunday.
When you do things like that,
do you know how bad
that makes me feel?
You should think
about me sometimes.
I...just don`t know you.
You know me, Mia.
The problem is,
you just don`t understand me.
Isn`t that right?
I know what
my little nun likes.
I thought you weren`t coming.
Hey. Go ahead, get in.
Let`s go.
They`ll see.
Well, we want them to see.
They`re our alibis.
Come on. You take my bedroom.
It`s down by the bathroom.
And stay here
till she sees you, O.K.?
Ah, Nicole!
What a surprise!
Irving, it`s Nicole!
Miss Horner,
I should say,
now that you are
the landlady.
I think about
your poor mother every day.
Bijou!
Well, come in.
We can`t today.
We`re just here for the weekend.
But meet my principal,
Mrs. Baran.
Hello.
Oh, how nice.
Welcome to Pittsburgh,
Mrs. Baran,
and the entire
Three Rivers area.
Oh, can you manage?
Irving!
Well, it must be
the post office, then.
Half the people
that work down there
aren`t American anymore, anyway.
I`ll send you
another check tomorrow.
I`ll drop by for it.
Tomorrow night, say?
You can bring your house guest,
if you like.
She`ll be busy.
You look more like
your mother every day.
From behind,
you can really see it.
I`ve been to see a lawyer,
and she tells me a divorce
would be very simple.
I could even keep the school.
I don`t want to talk
about it on the phone, Guy.
All right.
I`m at Nicole`s house.
Fine.
Yeah.
Well, tomorrow night is best.
We`ll be out tomorrow.
All right.
After 8:00.
Fine. Good-bye.
Good for you.
It`s good to get it over with.
Now we can get on
with our evening.
I should take him
off speed-dial.
One good drink oughta do it.
I can`t do this.
He`s never going to
leave you alone.
Does he leave me alone?
If I give him the school--
If you give him the school,
he`ll just sell it.
Then where will all the future
Lee Harvey Oswalds come from?
Anyway, it`s not like
he`s the one that won`t let go.
What do you mean?
What I mean is,
you still want him,
or you wouldn`t keep
sleeping with him.
It`s not love.
You don`t love people
who treat you this way.
Where`d you get that,
off a talk show?
You know, I`m not surprised
he likes to come to me
after he sleeps with you.
I don`t care.
I hate him.
I don`t feel anything.
I don`t feel anything.
You don`t feel anything.
How about when he does this?
Hmm?
Do you feel anything
when he does this?
You don`t feel anything?
He doesn`t do that to me.
Don`t you lie to me!
We`re not going to get anywhere
if you start lying to me now.
I know. It`s me. My fault.
It`s not your fault.
I know. I--
Oh, just snap out of it!
It`s not your fault, O.K.?
It`s his fault.
He is who he is.
And he`s going to keep being
who he is and doing what he does.
And he`s going to do it
and do it and do it...
We`re never going to
be free until he`s dead.
He`s my husband, Nicole.
Oh, yeah? Well, last week
he was happy to stand by
and watch you die.
Pull yourself together.
You`re going to scare him away.
He always parks out there
so the neighbors
won`t notice him.
He`ll be coming in
through the back door.
You`re going?
Yes. I`m going to the neighbors
to keep them busy.
I need 1 0 minutes.
O.K.?
O.K.?
Yeah.
Courage.
Make yourself one.
I want you to hear
what I`m saying, Guy.
I`m serious.
Ooh!
Mia`s serious.
Give me the goddamn drink.
It`s for your own good.
I`ll be a lot easier to handle
with some of this in me, right?
Right.
It`s a little cloudy.
What?
Whatever.
Do you want to talk,
or do you want to
stare at me all night?
The lawyer says
I can get a divorce
and keep the school.
I inherited it
before I got married.
You put me on the title.
You need me to sign
a quitclaim deed.
He didn`t mention that?
Tsk-tsk.
What`s the matter?
Are you all right?
What?
What were we talking about?
The title.
You forgot I`m on the title.
I could buy you out.
I could get a loan.
You give me the school,
and I`ll give you a divorce.
Frankly, I didn`t have
to get married to have lousy sex.
No. I did.
Come on, Mia.
Ooh.
Why don`t you have
a drink with me?
What did I ever do to you, Guy?
What did I do that`s so wrong?
You try living
with a fucking angel.
It`s easier living with a dog.
I`m not your little dog, Guy.
You do something with your hair?
Yeah. You did something
with your hair.
Let me make you feel good
like you know I can.
Isn`t that nice?
You don`t want to
split up, do you?
You don`t love me.
But you can`t let go.
What was that?
Something on TV.
Oh, you`re so good, Bijou!
Now that was her alarm bark.
It--It`s like her stranger bark,
only a little bit higher.
That doesn`t sound very good,
that kind of noise, Irv.
Why don`t I just
turn up the TV a little bit?
... Their marriage is worth saving.
Wejust heard from Tim and Tracy
who have been married
for less than a year,
but have already
been separated five times.
Will they reconcile?
Don`t you run away from me!
Aah!
When is she coming back?
You feel that?
You feel it?
What did you do for feelings
before I came along, Mia?
You shouldn`t get me mad.
It won`t happen again.
Come here, Mia.
Have another drink, Guy.
You deserve it.
What are you doing to me?
Listen!
I don`t know you that well.
I don`t ever want you
to come back to Tennessee again!
That`s the one--
...has returned.
I hope that was
an empty bottle, George.
You can`t afford
to waste good liquor.
Oh. Yeah.
I`m going to wait
until this is in color.
Liar! You haven`t--
You little bitch!
You`re trying to kill me!
Mia...
help me.
Say you`re sorry, Guy.
I love you.
How is he?
It wasn`t quick like you said.
Yeah, or quiet.
Well, it`s attempted murder now
if he does wake up.
We have no choice.
Come on.
O.K., get out his wallet.
It`s O.K. if your fingerprints
are on it.
Check and see if there`s
any gas station receipts.
There`s nothing.
O.K., put it back.
Put it back.
Now, go turn on the radio
in case there`s more noise.
Uhh!
But
In the arms of love
Your embrace
Fits me like a glove
In my world
You
Took control of me
And I fell in love
Hopelessly...
Aah!
Aah!
Get the water bottle!
Is it over?
It`s over.
Are you all right?
You`re blaming yourself.
Don`t.
For wanting him, I mean.
I was the same way.
Ohh! Oh, my God.
He tried to move.
He was alive.
Nicole...
let Irv help.
Look at them.
It`s too heavy.
Uh, Mrs. Baran...
this is Irv.
Hi.
Hi.
Well, he`s--he`s good
at this kind of thing.
Allow me.
- No. It`s fine.
- Please.
Bend your knees.
All right. Ready?
O.K., your end in first, Irv.
What do you got in here?
Books.
O.K.
Oh!
Thanks, Irv.
Oh, wait!
I made a coffee cake
for your trip!
Here. Oh.
Here.
Let`s go.
Right.
Nice shape on that principal.
Hmm.
That Nicole`s always
been a cold fish, though.
Yeah.
Bijou...
bad dog.
You take mine. I`ll take his.
Let`s stay together.
Sure.
Oh,Jesus.
Attention, all units.
All units, accident on
the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
Exit 1 2 is closed.
Units responding,
please give me your E. T.A.
E.M. T. is on their way. Over.
Move your vehicle right away.
We`ll get you out on the road
and out of this mess in no time.
Excuse me, sir?
Yes, ma`am?
Can I help, Officer?
No. Everything is fine.
Can I give the woman a lift?
I`m O.K. It`s drivable.
It`s not. You have a flat.
Oh.
Buddy, help me get this going.
Sorry it`s so heavy.
Pull it out straight.
Books, you know?
Uhh! Uhh!
Let me help you with that.
Look, ma`am,
just return to your car.
You can`t do anything tonight.
Thanks a lot.
Uhh!
Push.
O.K.
All right. Come on.
O.K.
Go get the lights.
Go.
Ohh!
All right.
Uhh!
Oh, my God.
O.K.
All right.
Uhh!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Shit.
Bastard.
All right, it`s over.
We better get the hell out of here.
He`ll never hurt us again.
What do we do now?
Wait for the body to surface.
They`ll do an autopsy, maybe.
He was drunk. He fell in.
When will it come up?
Tomorrow, maybe.
Oh, come on.
You can`t pull that off.
Why hasn`t he risen yet?
It`ll happen.
Be patient.
I`m not going to
be able to do this.
Well, I suggest you try.
It isn`t like you
burnt the toast, Mia.
You killed your husband.
It`s a little off the chart
demerit-wise, understand?
You`re so calm.
Look at you.
Your hair is done.
You`ve got makeup on...
This is a day
like any other day.
We did what we had to do,
and it`s done, O.K.?
It was self-defense.
You`ve been taking it
for too long now.
You finally said, ''Fuck off.''
Good for you.
Fuck him.
Fuck them.
Everything but ''fuck you.''
Roughly. Now, come on.
Places.
I desire.
Je desire.
They desire.
Ils desirent.
They desire...
feminine.
Elles desirent.
Hey, Tad, over here!
Ms. Horner. While
the cat`s away, the mice will--
Apparently.
Not at all.
Guy and I talked to
a new supplier Friday.
Portions are smaller.
Is Dr. Baran here?
His car`s back in the garage.
It was gone all weekend.
If he is, ask him if he`s going
to take his classes tomorrow?
I can`t possibly take on
any more--Mrs. Baran!
- Boys!
- You idiot.
What?
Why are you torturing her?
Isn`t it obvious
she doesn`t know where he is?
Miss Horner, please.
The students.
I don`t blame you, though.
He could make an effort
for your sakes...
uh, for her sake.
You`re drawing
attention to yourself.
I`m allowed to brood.
My husband`s disappeared.
You`ll feel better
when the body surfaces.
Yeah.
It always perks me up.
What do your saints say?
I`m brooding.
I`m not praying.
Lost your faith, huh?
I never really had
any to begin with, I guess.
Never believed in any of it--
God, the Virgin Mary,
that life begins at 40,
and that people are all
just basically good inside.
Pretty soon,
we`ll be the same person.
See how nice things turned out?
I`m going inside.
You know, it wasn`t too smart
changing the food like that.
You never would have done that
if he was alive.
Why kill him, then?
I like making it
better for the boys.
Still, if it`s
all the same with you,
I`d rather not hang
for fried chicken.
Why did you kill him?
You could have left him.
You could have left here.
I was underestimated.
Stop looking at it.
People are watching us.
I can`t stand it much longer.
Finally.
We`re going to have to get
the net from the shed.
Who wants to go?
- Me!
- Me!
Desantis?
Ohh!
What are we
going to do now?
We`ll have
to drain the pool.
I`ll get it.
No!
Why not?
He`s a child.
See if you can find it!
There`s something
down there.
It`s a lighter.
Hey, that`s Dr. Baran`s.
Remember the close-up
when he was playing with it?
Did you see anything else?
No.
That`s enough.
Go inside and change.
Take that up to
Dr. Baran`s office.
We`ll have to drain the pool.
And refill it?
That`s up to Dr. Baran.
All right, everybody.
That`s enough.
Go on inside and get ready
and go back to class.
Mia--
Mr. Gannon,
will you drain the pool?
I`ve got orders not to.
But my keys are in there.
Please?
Right away, please.
Here`s the penis
and the scrotum
that holds the testicles,
or testes, inside.
Now, when you`re around 1 4--
maybe sooner, maybe later--
the testes start making
a chemical substance called a hormone.
It`s this hormone
that causes the changes.
It starts hair growing
here under your arms
and on your face.
Mr. Gannon, what is it?
Something blocking the drain!
Since you want
it done right away,
I can`t help the noise.
You all know what sperm is?
Go on, Mr. Nuñez.
Atlantic...
Pacific...
Indian...
Arctic.
Arctic...
Class?
Atlantic...
Pacific...
Indian...
Arctic...
Mediterranean...
Gulf of Mexico...
and Caribbean.
Australian...
Hudson Bay...
Baltic Sea...
North Sea...
English Channel...
Irish Sea...
Bering Sea.
Mrs. Baran fainted!
Let`s go!
- Get a doctor.
- I`ll go!
Doctor`s very worried about you.
He thinks this is serious.
Where is the body?
Someone moved it.
That`s apparent.
Someone saw us put it in?
No.
Well, I don`t know.
Maybe.
I`ve got to find him.
No. Let`s just
stick to our story.
It`s even better like this
`cause we really
don`t know where he is.
He`ll turn up.
If he doesn`t, all the better.
Did you take
your heart medicine? No.
We`ve got to act naturally.
You have to start asking about Guy,
be more concerned,
like you would be
if he was really missing.
Ohh! Ohh!
Ohh!
What?
His suit.
Oh, my God.
Could I have those
in 20 minutes?
Ah! Dios mío!
Ask her.
Tell her if she sees
anything to call us.
He`s disappeared.
Vaya con Dios, O.K.?
Let`s just get these
and get out of here, O.K.?
Someone`s watching us.
Someone with Guy`s camera.
You need to eat, honey.
I`m not hungry.
Thank you.
He is dead, Mia.
He is dead.
We killed him together.
You saw him die.
What about the pictures?
I think someone took them
before he was killed...
right?
Who?
We`ll find that out
when they start blackmailing us.
He`s dead.
This is another thing.
Look, there`s something
I haven`t told you.
Open it.
It`s from the school accounts.
That`s why there`s
never any money there.
It was for Guy and me.
He said someone stole it.
I found it when
I searched for the body.
You killed him for money?
Believe me.
It wasn`t the only reason.
There`s $50,000 there, Mia.
We`ll split it.
You can use it to pay
for your goddamn fried chicken.
I can go to the police.
I can tell them what we did.
What you did.
We both did it.
I don`t think they`ll see that
as beneficial to me.
They`ll say,
''The wife gets the school,
''the money he embezzled,
her freedom.
''What did the other woman get?
Nothing.``
That`s how they`ll look at it.
I`ll say we were lovers.
Well, you can take the girl
out of the convent.
I thought we had
the same reason.
We did have the same reason.
I just had an extra one.
I`m sorry I lied to you.
I couldn`t do it now.
If you hadn`t found this,
you killed the one person
who could have
told you where it was.
He said we were partners,
and then he acted alone.
Mia!
Mia!
Mia!
Mia!
Hey. Where you going?
I`ve got to go.
What are you talking about?
This.
It was under my door this morning.
It`s over. He`s been found.
This is Sunbury.
This is 20 miles from here.
How would he get there?
Someone dumped him in the river.
I don`t know.
We should call the police first
and file a missing persons report.
I`ve got to go. It`s him.
All right.
I`ll go with you.
No, I`ll wait.
Fine.
You can wait in there.
No. I`ll be fine.
Just...
don`t let him forget me.
You`re not going
to light that, are you?
You can light these?
In America?
Nah. I`m quitting.
Nicoret.
Excuse me.
My husband is missing.
I think this might be him.
How long?
Four days.
Have you filled out
a missing persons report?
No.
So, has he left before
without telling you?
The description fits.
Uh-huh.
O.K.John Doe,
That`s right.
Describe his clothing.
The body was naked, it says.
We don`t always tell
the press everything.
Well, I--I didn`t see him
the day he disappeared.
Any jewelry?
A wedding ring.
That`s all.
He doesn`t always wear that.
Can I just see the body?
Appendectomy scar?
No.
I see.
No.
Hold on.
Howie?
I think we have Mrs. Doe here.
Hi.
Prepare yourself.
The sand does a lot of damage.
Oh, my God.
Is that your husband, ma`am?
No.
Oh?
Poor kid.
Wasn`t her husband.
Never saw him before in her life.
Excuse me?
Mrs. Baran?
Who are you?
Forgive me for intruding.
Come, sit down.
Coffee, please.
I saw you
at the sheriff`s station.
I got your name
off the view request.
Shirley Vogel.
You`re the police?
Cagney And Lacey.
That kind of thing.
You know, they met with me once?
Research stuff.
Nice girls.
I say ''girls.''
That O.K. with you?
Anyway...
flash forward 1 0 years,
I`m on medical leave.
The big ''C.''
Air.
I`m sorry.
Ah, whatever.
I knew it was coming.
My family--
never two boobs in a coffin.
I`m sorry, but I don`t
know why you`re here.
Remember your husband?
Uh...
could I get some coffee, please?
You mean--
I`m sure he`ll turn up.
Yeah. Wrapped around
a pier apparently.
You drove all the way from...
That`s very kind of you, but...
Who the hell am I, right?
I don`t blame you.
I know a guy
in the department in Hazelton.
I could call him,
he`ll visit, get the details.
I don`t want
to make it official.
Suppose it`s just intentional.
Here`s your coffee.
Yeah. I know what you mean.
Men.
How do they sleep at night?
They have sex.
That`s how they sleep at night.
He might be home already.
This place.
Jesus.
It`s no Sizzler, is it?
He`ll be furious
if I`ve gone to the police.
That`s what I`m trying to tell you.
Keep it private.
Once the boys
get their hooks into you...
I couldn`t afford you.
We run a school.
A school?
Then you can forget the police.
You can`t afford
that kind of publicity.
Look, 2, 3 days,
I chase him down
to some girlfriend`s house,
and I scare the shit out of him.
That wouldn`t be easy.
Look, I--
I don`t want money.
I mean, look at me.
I`m chasing all over
Pennsylvania
for lunch dates
with guys I couldn`t stand
Give me something to do.
You ever smoke?
No.
Yeah.
Well...
look at this security system.
You know, what is this,
a piece of the true cross?
Aren`t you hungry?
Oh.
I thought I should eat.
You know what your problem is?
You`re feeling guilty.
No.
I`m not.
It`s not your fault.
It`s men.
Testosterone.
They should put it in bombs.
You want that?
Mrs. Baran would like me
to help...
informally.
Well, Ms. Vogel--
or is it detective?
Detective.
Well, frankly, Detective,
I don`t think
we need to overreact.
We`ve seen this before.
We have?
We, we, we.
What is she,
the school nurse?
When was the last time
you saw your husband?
Last Saturday.
He was asleep
when we left at 7:00.
Nicole and I
drove out to her duplex.
Oh, look!
This must be nice--
when it`s full.
Isn`t it dangerous
keeping it empty like this?
Yeah. Well, we lost
some keys in there.
We should get back
to our students.
They`re on work crew this week.
Yeah. So I noticed.
Must save money,
having the kids keep up the place.
These older buildings.
None of his friends
know where he is?
We haven`t asked them.
It`s kind of awkward.
''Hey, my husband`s disappeared,
have you seen him?`` You know.
Her husband.
It wouldn`t be awkward for me.
If it`s O.K., Mrs. Baran,
I`ll look at his address book.
You know, Detective,
I don`t think we need
to make a mountain
out of a molehill.
Exactly. Imagine
this place crawling with police.
Wouldn`t be something
you`d write home about, would it?
We`ll tiptoe.
May I see your husband`s things?
Of course.
So nice meeting you,
Ms. Horner.
Oh, this is lucky.
A phone bill.
Yeah. It came this morning.
May I?
Ah. This must be Ms. Horner.
Pittsburgh.
Earlier this month.
I--I call her there sometimes
when she goes there on weekends.
Girl talk.
Yeah.
This goes through Monday.
He didn`t call you there
over the weekend?
No.
What kind of car
does your husband drive?
We have one car--
the Cherokee.
How did you break the taillight?
I don`t know.
It happened a while ago.
What was he wearing
when he disappeared?
Um...
his blue suit.
Could I see his closet?
Yes.
It`s missing.
His blue suit...
and his belt
with the silver buckle.
You just have to look
and you know.
Good for you.
Place for everything,
and everything in its place.
I hope we`re not too late.
There`s video cameras out there.
Is that the news?
Oh, no. It`s just
some PR for the school.
Is that all, Detective?
I`m really tired.
Of course.
The address book?
It`s in his office.
I`ll find it.
Oh, um...
it`s just one more thing.
That isn`t
the suit there, is it?
Mia, you`re needed
to take Voss` classes.
Oh, Detective,
you`re still here.
I was wondering
if this is the suit
Dr. Baran wore on Sunday.
No.
But close. He had two.
Well,
maybe I`ll go and speak
with some of
the other teachers now.
Ms. Horner.
Mm-hmm.
Why did you bring her here?
I`m supposed to act concerned.
Anyway, it keeps the police away.
Fine.
That woman should
wear a prosthesis.
I hate that in-your-face
survivor crap.
I`m really tired, Nicole.
It`s O.K. You did fine.
I heard you from the hallway.
Just don`t see her
alone anymore.
Promise?
Can I get a printout of that?
Yeah. You can get
a dub of it, too.
This is some really cool stuff.
Total Inside Edition material.
Yeah. The magic hour tape.
This guy gives
''prick'' a bad name.
What doesn`t?
I want this one, too.
O.K., if x equals 4,
then x minus 2 is?
Great.
when x equals 3 is?
I`m talking to you.
Oh, um, 1 3.
Thank you.
Ahem.
I want you to review
these equations,
continue to work them
until I return.
And stay in your seats.
This is Ms. Horner.
Nicole, this is Lisa Campos.
Hello.
Ms. Campos is looking for Guy.
Well, I`m sure
Mrs. Baran told you
that Dr. Baran is away on business.
You said you didn`t know
where he was.
Well...
someone has to pay.
He said he would, but...
I thought it over.
I don`t want to wait
till next month like he said.
Excuse me?
Ms. Campos is expecting.
Unto her a child will be born.
What does this have to do
with Dr. Baran?
What do you think?
What makes you think
that it`s Guy`s?
That`s what he said--
But come on, I would know.
I don`t sleep around.
And he said he`d pay.
I`m not putting it on my card.
I`m maxed out.
O.K.
Well...
you`re absolutely certain
this is Dr. Baran`s?
What does she have
to say about it?
Abortion is murder.
Well, I`m going to have
an anesthetic, for God`s sake.
How much is this going to cost?
They want 650,
and that`s a clinic.
I`m not holding anybody up here,
you know?
I just want what he promised.
Besides...
it`s your husband.
You don`t want me
to have his baby.
I wouldn`t have come,
only he said you knew
about his girlfriends,
Mrs. Baran.
Thank you.
And tell him not to call
when he does get back,
you know?
It`s boundary time.
Incidentally, Ms. Campos...
when was the last time
you saw Dr. Baran?
Sunday afternoon.
I dropped by.
He was real wired-up
about something.
Figured you two had a fight.
Make him pay you back.
Anyway...
good-bye.
You knew about her?
Yeah.
Since last fall.
Right after you came.
You should`ve told me about her.
Why would I want you
to be hurt like I was?
Somebody knows.
There was a big pileup
on the I-80.
And, uh,
technically, there
could`ve been a mistake.
Does anyone else
use it for their travel?
No.
No one you can think of?
All they got was a list
of license plate numbers.
They could`ve gotten
a number wrong,
but it looks
like that was his car.
There`s no way to know
if he was actually
driving the car.
I was just telling Mrs. Baran
I ran Dr. Baran`s license plate
through the DMV.
That pileup Monday evening
on the I-80?
He was in it.
The report doesn`t
tell us much,
but his car`s on it.
Didn`t you tell me
it was an old dent?
Did I?
Let`s say he left Sunday,
wearing one of the blue suits.
Couldn`t he have been
heading to Pittsburgh?
He stopped for gas
Sunday in Williamsport.
Oh?
Yes. Mrs. Baran gave me
his credit card numbers
on the phone this morning.
Anyway,
doesn`t it look like
he was trying to see you?
Pittsburgh is a big town.
You`re sure you didn`t
hear from him
any time after Saturday?
Oh--
That`s not the kind
of thing we`d forget.
Mia? Dear,
aren`t you on room checks?
Oh, yeah.
Excuse me.
Well, I`ll be in touch.
I`m glad she didn`t ask.
There weren`t any charges
on the cards
from Sunday on.
What are room checks?
Drug searches.
Some of the kids here used to use.
My son had a habit.
My husband and I looked
into this kind of place.
He`s dead now.
Your husband?
Son.
I.V. drug users.
You know what
happens to them nowadays.
But my ex is alive.
Isn`t God quirky?
You got an ex?
Nothing official.
Mine thought he was
God`s gift to women.
Like that topped my list--
God, please send me something
that`ll wear black nylon socks
to bed every night.
My idea of heaven
is a place where
they screw you barefoot.
I should pass
a hat for you.
Don`t feel sorry for me.
I got him to leave.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
He was too dull to kill.
What about her?
She ever want to kill
her husband?
Why would she do that?
Maybe she found out
you were sleeping with him.
Oh, that`s so clever.
What`d you do, ask
a faculty member or any student?
I know. You read it
in the brochure, right?
So she knew?
Of course she knew.
Ask her.
Come on,
she`s not a murderer.
She`s an ex-nun
for Christ`s sake.
Yeah. Remember them?
They disappeared overnight
like dial phones.
What about you?
What if he wouldn`t leave her?
Honey, if I couldn`t get
a man to leave her,
I wouldn`t kill him.
I`d kill myself.
Well, he has left her...
apparently.
One way or another.
Well...
unless there`s
anything else...
Yeah, there is.
Just one more thing.
Guy did it barefoot.
''Did,'' Ms. Horner?
Don`t you mean ''does''?
Mrs. Baran?
It`s dinner time, Erik.
You should go inside
with the others.
Are you O.K.?
You know the rules, Erik.
Your table won`t be able
to eat before you`re there.
It`s so much nicer here
since he left.
I hope he never comes back.
Where did you find those?
I found them yesterday.
Give them to me.
They`re good, though.
They`re just a little rusty.
Give them to me!
Doesn`t mean anything.
The pool was empty,
and maybe he saw them
at the bottom.
I didn`t. Did you?
If they were so plain
to see...
Don`t you see what it means?
Yeah. It means
we overlooked them.
It means Guy`s watching us.
He`s alive.
He`s dead,
and I`m not sorry.
And neither are you,
if you`re really honest
with yourself.
Killing him
is a good thing--
like planting a tree.
Maybe there is a God.
What are you talking about?
I haven`t believed for so long.
So when the pool was empty,
I thought, maybe there is a God.
And He knows what we did,
and He`s coming for us.
It`s not God, honey.
That`s a lady detective
with one breast.
You`re always laughing at me.
So was Guy.
He must be laughing now.
I`m not laughing at you, Mia.
You are...
a little.
Inside.
It`s lonely without God,
isn`t it?
It`s just lonely...
period.
They`re filling the pool!
When`s it going to be done?
Should be soon.
That`s great.
We should have canceled this.
Everything`s fine.
Just calm down.
Dykes.
And that would explain
why they`re not all over you.
Thanks.
We really could use Dr. Baran
for these shots.
He`s still away on business.
We`ll do without him.
I don`t want to be in it.
O.K. It`s parents` day,
and these are your parents.
Now, boys, you`re happy,
but try not to look relieved.
O.K.?
Um...I`m glad to see you,
Mom and Dad,
but, boy, is this school great!
Moms, one or two of you
can look misty-eyed.
Who wants to be misty?
O.K. Here.
All right, you, and, uh...
you.
Don`t overdo it.
Let`s make sure everyone
has their numbers.
Number one?
O.K.
Is that Dr. Baran?
What are you talking about?
Up there on the second floor,
at the window.
Wait. I`ll play it back.
Well, it`s someone, that`s for sure.
It`s Guy.
It`s Guy.
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned...
What are you doing?
I`m fasting and praying
for our sins.
I want you to stop that...
and come inside.
You`re not well.
Each time I go to sleep,
I have to kill him over and over.
No, Mia. Someone`s
playing a game with us.
Now, come inside.
You`re ill.
It`s holy water.
Come on.
What are you looking at?
Go inside!
Let`s get out of here.
Go in!
Go!
Where`s your heart medicine?
I`m sure it`s there.
I think you`re out.
I`ll go to the pharmacy
and get it refilled.
You should take these.
Here. Go on.
You`ll be out like a light
before I get back.
I want you to go, Nicole.
O.K.
No. I mean away.
Leave the school...
for good.
I`m sick of you.
If they only knew.
They will if you keep
acting like this.
You know, the church
can`t save you now,
no matter how much
you pay them off.
I know you gave that priest
my money.
The money should go
to the people who love you.
It should go
to the people you love.
They don`t love you, Mia.
They used you.
And now that you`re scared,
you`re using them, too.
Like you used me?
You`re a good teacher, Nicole.
We should have paid you more.
You like playing
the victim, don`t you?
Get out!
Leave me alone!
Fine, but let me tell you one thing,
from one saint to another--
You should keep
right on praying.
Wear your knees out
that way for a change.
Hello?
Hello?
-
-
Oh.
Aah!
Who`s there?
Who`s there?
Get the water bottle!
Aah! Aah!
He`s dead.
He`s dead.
He`s dead.
God forgive you...
he`s dead.
Aah! Aah!
You`re a lot tougher than I thought,
you little bitch.
Jesus, Guy.
Sucking on that douche-bag hose
for eight hours...
and that ride in the back...
I`ve still got a cold.
I don`t care
what the doctors say...
that fucking heart
was made of iron.
I tried to reach you
to call it off.
Call it off?
What for?
I wish I could have
seen her face.
Some of those gags were great.
What are we going to do
with that detective now?
Snooping around.
She got hers.
You were supposed
to call me.
I think you should find the body.
I`ll show up tomorrow...
and you can
break the news to me.
I`ll be grief-stricken.
I think you should go.
Go?
Yeah.
Why?
Haven`t you missed me?
Yeah.
That`s better.
It`s over.
So, let`s celebrate.
O.K., but I--
I don`t--you know--
I just--I don`t want you
to get caught.
I think you`d better--
Is this natural?
Huh?
I mean, the tub is full.
Hmm?
Shouldn`t she be undressed?
Yeah, O.K.
-
- Aah!
I thought she was dead.
I...
I thought she was.
I did.
Look, she`s not going
to do anything.
Lying bitch!
We`ll do something different!
Just let her go!
- You`re with her!
- No, I`m not!
Mia, go!
You...bitch!
Aah!
No!
Just you wait!
No! No!
Mia!
Mia!
Don`t you run from me!
I said stop!
No! No!
Come here!
Aah!
Let me see your face!
Was it a lonely week...
or did you two
keep each other company?
How does it feel,
after all these years
of sainthood,
finding out
we`re perfectly matched?
You`re just like me...
soul mates.
- Aah!
- Aah!
Bitch.
Do you want to confess
before you die?
Say, ''I`m sorry, Guy.''
Maybe I`ll forgive you,
even if God won`t.
Fuck you!
You son of a bitch!
This is a week late, asshole!
Aah!
Mia.
Mia.
Oh,Jesus.
Mia, come on.
Aah!
This way it`ll be easier
to claim self-defense.
You know, paramedics
can work miracles.
One of us should go
get one right away.
Oh, Mia.
I`m sorry.
Good-bye.
