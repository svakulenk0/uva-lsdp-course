Pass it to me!
Hit it!
Yes! Yes!
Jack, I just wanted to say that
she's not doing too well right now.
Her condition has gotten a lot worse.
I've given her something for the pain.
Mark?
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, Mom.
- Why didn't you wake me?
- I thought you should sleep.
Rather see you.
- Has Dad told you everything?
- Yeah.
I know you'll be OK.
Mom...
I'll always be with you, Mark.
Always.
I love you.
I love you too, Mom.
You're not gonna die, Mom.
I promise.
You're not gonna die cos I won't let you.
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
The Lord bless her and keep her.
The Lord make his face to shine
upon her and be gracious to her.
The Lord lift up his countenance upon her
and give her peace. Amen.
I can't leave him.
- He needs me.
- It's two weeks, Jack.
I can't do it.
It's not like you'll be
leaving him with strangers.
- I'm your brother. We're family.
- Mm-hm.
You said, if you could close this deal
in Tokyo, you and Mark would be set.
- You'd never have to leave him again.
- I only want what's best for him.
I know this is tough,
but this is your chance, Jack.
You have to take it, for you and for Mark.
Besides, it'll do him good
to be around other kids right now.
I'll bring him to Maine myself.
We need to spend some time together.
Hey, you. Copilot.
If you ever get tired
of bombing the universe...
...you're missing
a lot of great stuff out here.
Mark, I know you're hurting...
but please don't shut me out like this.
- She's coming back.
- No, Mark.
Maybe not as herself,
but she's gonna come back.
Mark, I miss her, too.
But she's gone.
No.
Mark.
Mark!
They're here!
- You made it.
- Oh, man. Eleven states in three days.
- Connie, say hello to your Uncle Jack.
- Hello, Uncle Jack.
- She's beautiful, Wallace.
- Like her mom.
- How's it goin', Mark?
- Pretty good.
- Mom said I can show you the house.
- She always gets her way.
Things are gonna be OK, Jack.
Mom! Guess who's here!
- Mark?
- Hi.
Oh, my gosh. Look at you!
I can't believe it's been ten years.
Jack.
Hi. I really appreciate
everything you're doing.
Janice would have done the same.
Henry. Come on down here.
Hospitality, Henry.
Here. I made two of 'em,
so we could be brothers.
Oh, well,
as if one wasn't enough.
OK. You know, I spoke with
Alice Davenport this morning.
She's the therapist who works
with Wallace at the hospital.
She said she'd be glad
to talk with Mark while you're gone.
I think it's a good idea.
I can't seem to reach him.
Does everyone have everything they need?
Sure, Mom.
This is really beautiful.
- Do you want some salad, Jack?
- Please.
You know they
tore down the lighthouse?
Oh, no. That one on the point?
I loved that old place.
Yeah, so did we.
- Isn't that where you two first, uh...
- First what?
It's, um... where your father
and I... had our first picnic.
- No, that's not gonna do it.
- Hey, here we go.
Now you have to get the insides out.
That's where this comes in.
Like that.
Henry, please!
OK, wait, wait, wait.
Jack. I think he's gonna be fine.
Yeah.
Mark, you understand, don't you?
I'm leaving you now so I...
so I never have to leave you again.
Two weeks, could be less.
So cheer up!
It's winter break. All you have to do is
play with Henry and you have a great time.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too.
We'll be together real soon.
I promise.
Give me a kiss.
I love you.
Bye, Dad.
Grenade!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Not so fast. How about some breakfast?
- Did you sleep OK last night?
- Yeah.
Yeah? Henry didn't keep you
up all night talking?
- No. It was fine.
- Good.
We're really glad you're here, Mark.
Hey, Mark! Come on! Let's go!
- See you at lunch.
- Thanks.
Mark!
- Nice catch. Hit me.
- Hey!
Afraid of heights?
- No.
- Good.
See you at the top.
- You coming?
- Sure.
Come on, it's easy.
Help me up.
If I let you go,
do you think you could fly?
Help.
Hey!
Stop!
Hey, Henry, grenade!
Oh, yeah? Watch this.
Wow! Great shot.
Yeah!
Hey! What the hell's goin' on here,
goddamn it?!
- Time to go.
- Come back here, you little bastards!
Hey, wait up, Henry!
Hey, cool.
What you got in the box?
- Go on.
- They give you cancer.
Who cares? You're gonna die anyway.
Did you see your mom after she was dead?
I wanted to. They wouldn't let me.
You should have made them let you.
It's very important.
See, people don't like to talk about death.
That's why you have to investigate.
- It's scientific.
- It doesn't feel like that.
What did your mom look like
the last time you saw her?
- Kinda pale.
- Kinda pale.
I took a real good look when my kid brother
Richard drowned in the bathtub.
- Your brother drowned?
- He was completely blue.
You should've looked at her eyes and lips...
...and touched her skin to see
what it felt like-hot, cold.
- Shut up about my mom.
- Hey, don't get mad.
- I'm just trying to be scientific.
- Shut up or I'll hit you.
Try it...
...and I'll throw you down there.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, look. I'm sorry.
That was really dumb of me.
I know how I'd feel if I didn't have a mom.
Friends?
OK.
- I know, but that guy was scary.
- I know, and big. You were just...
You were white.
And you were like, brrrrm!
All right, guys, it's late.
Knock it off.
I mean it. Not another peep.
Peep! Peep!
Hey, Henry.
- What?
- Today was fun.
Tomorrow will be even better.
Whoa!
- Hey, you ever read Skeleton Man?
- Who?
He's this really cool superhero
you can't kill cos he's already dead.
- Don't you ever read comic books?
- No, those things warp your mind.
Hey!
Nice knowin' ya!
Come on!
No!
Henry, come on! Let's go.
I love that dog.
- Isn't that your mom?
- Yeah. She's always out there.
- Why?
- She's goes up there to think about Richard.
Kinda weird, huh?
Come on. I wanna show you
my new invention.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- To my shed.
Awesome! What does it do?
It took me three months
to make it. Beautiful, huh?
You pull the cable back to here,
and you load over there.
Grab a bolt. Go ahead. Lock and load.
Now we...
...line up the kitty cat.
Don't hit her! Just give her a scare.
Sure.
What a great shot!
Yeah. But the sight's not right yet.
You know, this is a nice change.
Most of my patients,
all they wanna do is talk.
Well, I just don't have anything else to say.
Your dad thinks you do.
- He wants me to talk about my mom.
- Sometimes it helps.
I can handle it.
- You can?
- I have to.
Why?
Because when you make a promise...
...when something's your fault...
What did you do?
I let someone die.
Mom?
Mom?
Mark?
Honey...
...what's the matter?
It is you.
You came back.
I knew you'd come back.
Oh, sweetheart. I'm right here.
OK, I'm right here.
It's OK.
Shh, it's OK.
It's all right.
I'm right here. I'm right here.
I know you miss her.
It's OK. It's gonna be OK.
It's OK.
It's OK.
OK. All right, you got a piece. Now.
- It's got blue on it.
- So it has to be the sky.
Right. And it's got a straight edge.
So it has to go here.
Hey, you got it. All right!
- Mark.
- Yeah?
- Do you like living in our house?
- Sure.
We're gonna look after you real good,
so you won't be sad.
Mark, 0900 hours. Let's move out.
- Not you.
- Why not? He's my friend, too.
I'll play with you later.
I don't care about your stupid secrets!
I got my own secrets.
I'm not gonna tell you a single one!
Status.
System armed and ready.
- Try to hit that sign.
- Negative.
Try to hit that light.
Negative.
Targeting.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!
Oh, my God.
I was only trying to scare him.
Hey, Mark. Where's your sense of humour?
Mark?
- I'm sorry.
- It doesn't matter. They always fall down.
Isn't she beautiful?
Did you like her?
Yeah. Everybody did.
She was a wonderful person.
And she loved you very much, Mark.
The last time I saw her...
she said she'd always be with me.
It's true.
Your mother's alive in you.
She'll always be part of you.
And you.
Yeah.
Is that Richard?
Yeah.
- I bet you miss him.
- Yeah, I sure do.
- Hi.
- Hi, Henry.
Mark, I have something
to show you in the shed.
You want to? Go ahead.
I'll put these away, OK?
So what are you guys up to out there?
Sorry, Mom. Top secret.
Look, I'm sorry about the dog.
It was an accident.
You don't think I'd do a thing
like that on purpose now, do you?
- So what d'you wanna show me?
- I want you to meet somebody very special.
- Who is he?
- Mr Highway.
Wow. What are you gonna do with him?
It depends.
- On what?
- On you.
- Whether or not you'll help me.
- Help you?
I promise you something amazing...
...something you'll never forget.
Are you in?
Where are we goin'?
We're here.
Here. Help me rest him up here.
OK.
Come on, Mr Highway. Take a look.
Poor Mr Highway.
He's thinking about the end.
He's had enough of this terrible life.
- What?
- Say goodbye.
No!
Come on. Let's go.
I didn't know. I didn't know.
- You didn't tell me. How could you do that?
- Shh. Just be quiet.
Do you know what you did?
Hey, come on. We did it together.
You could have killed people.
- With your help.
- Hey, I didn't know you were gonna do that.
I feel sorry for you, Mark.
You just don't know how to have fun.
- What?
- It's because you're scared all the time.
I know. I used to be scared, too.
- But that was before I found out.
- Found out what?
That once you realise
you can do anything, you're free.
You could fly.
Nobody can touch you.
Nobody.
Mark...
...don't be afraid to fly.
You're sick.
Hey, I promised you something amazing,
something you'll never forget.
Where's the gratitude?
- The largest one.
- The largest one? Ready?
Can you catch this?
Where'd it go?
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm here at Route 233 on
the outskirts of Rock Harbor...
...where today there was a ten-car accident.
Lieutenant Holman of the Rock Harbor
police said it was a miracle...
...no one was seriously injured. Four people
were taken to the hospital for minor injuries.
They have since been released. This is
Andrea Hall reporting. Back to you, Bob.
Go ahead, tell him. Or better yet,
why don't we tell him together?
"It was Mark, Dad. He talked me into it."
"We were just playing a game. I had no idea
he was gonna do something like that."
"Please, go easy on him. It's not his fault
he's all screwed up cos he misses his mom."
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
Dad, Mark has something to tell ya.
- What is it? What's wrong with Mark?
- I don't know. He's been acting pretty weird.
I better go see if he's OK.
I told my dad I'd see if you were OK.
Well, are you OK, Mark?
Leave me alone.
Leave you alone? This is my room.
Guess what? Mom says
we can go skating tomorrow.
Connie, what did I tell you
about coming into my room?
But you guys weren't working or anything.
You didn't answer my question,
so I'm gonna have to do it for you.
You're not allowed to come into my room.
Not now, not ever. Never!
You're wrong about that.
This is my room, too.
And I say she can stay.
Mom, they're fighting!
You like my sister, don't you?
Such a sweet little girl.
It'd be too bad if something were
to happen to her, if she got hurt.
You'd be sad, wouldn't you, Mark?
But, hey, accidents will happen.
Just ask my mom about Richard.
Boys, boys! Henry!
What's going on?
I'm sorry, Mom. We were playing
this really dumb game.
We weren't fighting.
We were just playing. Weren't we, Mark?
Yeah. Playing.
Well, all right,
but just not so rough, OK?
You two looked like you were
trying to kill each other.
Susan told me you were here.
I guess you forgot our appointment.
I just didn't feel like talking.
Talking helps.
It helped the last time, didn't it?
You're a doctor.
You know things.
Well, some things.
What do you think? What makes people evil?
Evil's a word people use when they've
given up trying to understand someone.
There's a reason for everything
if we could just find it.
What if there isn't a reason?
What if something just is?
Why, Mark? Do you think you're evil?
Cos you let your mother die?
You know that's not true.
What if there was this boy...
...and he did these terrible things
because he liked doing them?
Wouldn't you say he was evil?
I don't believe in evil.
You should.
Connie, come on! It's time for lunch.
- Evans' residence. Henry speaking.
- Hey, it's Uncle Jack.
- Oh. Hi, Uncle Jack.
- Is Mark around?
Mark? No. Mark's not here right now.
- Do you know where he is?
- No, I don't know where he is.
- Are you boys having fun?
- We're having lots of fun.
Mark really likes it here. You know
something? We really like him, too.
Great. Well, would you tell him I called?
- OK, Uncle Jack. Bye.
- Bye.
So what are you guys up to this afternoon?
I don't know. Not much.
Well, I'm taking your mother
out to dinner tonight.
Can you characters baby-sit yourselves
and not get into too much trouble?
Sure, Dad.
Dad, can I stay up and watch
Monster Theater tonight?
No. It might warp
your impressionable brain.
- You're not the boss.
- Yes, I am, vermin.
Henry. That's enough.
What's a vermin?
Mom, Dad, guess what? Mark's been saying
he'd like to move into Richard's room.
- That's not true.
- He seems to like it in there.
- You know, that's not a bad idea.
- Wallace.
We've been through this before. I just...
- I don't wanna move in there.
- Mark, don't lie.
Honey, give it some thought.
We can't keep it like that for ever.
- It's turning into a museum.
- I know, but I didn't say for ever.
That room'll change when I'm ready.
If Mark wants to move,
there's a nice room on the third floor.
- But Henry's making it up.
- Honey, if Mark moved in, it could help.
It needs to be lived in.
I'm not saying throw out the toys.
Let's... I... I just don't wanna
talk about it right now.
I know you don't, but we've gotta face it.
I do face it.
I face it every day.
- You're the one who's forgetting.
- Susan.
- Oh, Wallace.
- Susan.
Henry!
Hi, Mom.
Don't cry, Mom.
Don't cry, Mom.
- You look fantastic.
- Do you really have to go out?
Yeah, Mark. We've been planning this
for weeks. You guys'll have fun.
Listen, honey. Restaurant number's
by the phone if you need us, OK?
All right, guys, good night!
Night, Mom and Dad!
We won't be late.
Mark! Guess what we're gonna play?
Hide-and-seek, and I'm hiding first.
No, Connie, wait! I've got a better idea.
I bet I find her first.
Connie, where are you?
Connie!
Connie!
Aagh!
Hey, no fair.
"No fair"?
What do you think this is? A game?
Connie, where are you?
Connie!
Connie!
What's going on?
This is fun. Let's do it again.
No, Connie. It's bedtime.
You heard her. She wants to play again.
Connie, what if I read you
a bedtime story instead?
Connie doesn't wanna read stories.
Do you, Connie?
I do too, vermin!
"And all the girls cried 'Boohoo!
We want to have our appendix out too."'
"Good night, little girls.
Thank the Lord you are well."
"'And now go to sleep' said Miss Clavell.
She turned out the light and closed the door."
"And that's all there is.
There isn't any more."
That was a darling story, Mark.
- What are you doing?
- I wanna tuck in my kid sister.
Such a sweet little thing.
Do you really think I'd hurt her?
Yes.
What are you gonna do?
Watch her all night?
Wallace, I'm sorry, but...
You've gotta stop
blaming yourself about Richard.
I can't. I just can't.
I left him alone. Less than six inches of water
in the tub and I left him to answer the phone.
Susan, it wasn't your fault.
You better get to the hospital.
Do you want me to drop
Connie off at the Andersons'?
No, she, uh...
She went skating with Henry in Miller's pond.
- Hey, where's your skates?
- Connie!
Connie!
Connie!
- Connie!
- Don't go with him!
Thin ice!
Henry!
Look out! Look out! Look out! No!
Help me, Henry. Help me.
Connie! Connie!
Henry, help me. Help me.
Help me out!
Let us through. Let us through.
Stay back. Stay back.
Right. All right.
All right, let's get her up.
- Wallace!
- Susan, she's fine.
She's fine. It's OK.
They pulled her out in time.
She's gonna be OK. She's OK.
I just thank God she's all right.
There's something I have to tell you.
- What?
- I'm not sure. I wasn't real close.
At the pond... I don't think what
happened at the pond was an accident.
What do you mean?
The ice was too thin.
Henry was spinning her around.
They were going way too fast.
And he just let go.
He threw her toward the thin ice.
- Mark.
- Henry said he hated her.
- What are you trying to tell me?
- I've told you.
I'm telling you.
Connie didn't just slip.
You don't know what he is.
Henry tried to kill Connie
and he could do it again...
Stop it! Stop it, that's a lie.
Henry's my son.
He's my little boy and I love him.
Don't ever come to me with these lies again.
- Henry.
- Mom.
- I didn't see you.
- Shh. Don't wake her up.
- I thought you were home with Daddy.
- I was worried about Connie.
She's gonna be fine.
- She wake up yet?
- Yeah, for a little while.
- She's still pretty confused, though.
- Yeah.
I don't think she's gonna
remember much of what happened.
That's good. It's probably better
for her to forget about the whole thing.
Henry. What did happen on the ice?
I told you, Mom. It was an accident.
Yeah?
I know I've always treated her
like a bratty kid sister...
...but until yesterday I never realised
how much she meant to me.
I know.
I'd better go home now.
- Henry.
- Yeah, Mom?
Never mind. I'll see you at home.
- Tell Connie I was here.
- I will.
- Hello, Dad.
- Mark, how are you, son?
- You've gotta come back here.
- Why? What's wrong?
It's Henry. He's been doing things.
Terrible things.
- What do you mean, terrible things?
- He's got everyone fooled.
Everyone thinks he's this great kid...
...but he's really evil.
- Evil?
He killed this dog with this thing
that he made that fires steel bolts.
Then yesterday... he tried to kill Connie.
Whoa, wait...
Mark, is Wallace there? Or Susan?
I tried to tell them,
but they won't believe me. Nobody will.
What about Dr Davenport?
She just thinks
I'm some screwed-up little kid.
Mark, I want you to go to Dr Davenport
and you tell her what you told me.
- All right.
- I'll be there soon.
Please hurry.
What's been going on?
What's troubling you?
Mark! Good.
Hi, Mark.
- What are you doing here?
- He's just here because he wants to help.
He says you two have been
having some problems.
- He's the problem.
- Mark!
You're on his side, aren't you?
- I'm on your side, too.
- No, you're not.
He's got you fooled, just like everybody else.
Mark! Wait.
I didn't mean to cause you any trouble.
It's not your fault, Henry.
Mark is going through some difficult things.
- Is he OK?
- What do you mean?
Maybe I shouldn't say anything.
But the way he acts when nobody's around...
Dr Davenport, he scares me sometimes.
Why?
What does he do?
Please don't ask me that.
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?
Cos Mark's my friend.
You won't be betraying him, I promise you.
Please, Henry. Tell me everything.
Everything?
Sure missed an interesting session.
I like therapy.
- What did you tell her?
- Sorry. That's strictly confidential.
But you better stop telling lies about me,
cos no one's gonna believe you.
Sooner or later
they're gonna find out about you.
Who's "they"? My dad? My mom?
- I told your mom.
- Why would she believe you?
- She's my mom, not yours.
- You know, you're wrong about that.
- She is my mother.
- Your mom? You crazy?
Your mom's maggot food.
My mom said she'd always be with me.
She chose your mom
as a way of coming back...
...but I guess you wouldn't
understand that. But it's true.
She's my mother now.
Hey, Mark.
Don't fuck with me.
Looking for a midnight snack?
Go ahead. Eat. Drink.
- Don't let me stop you.
- What did you do?
"Do"? Me?
Oh, I get it.
You think I put something
in my family's food.
You think I...
Mark, come on.
Do you really think
I'd do a thing like that?
Mom, Dad, it's Mark! Better come quick.
No, Mark, stop. Stop.
It's all a mistake.
He's trying to poison you!
- Oh, Mark.
- No!
Calm down.
Mark, please stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
- Just stop.
- No! No!
- We'll talk in the morning.
- What for?
- Nobody believes me.
- Mark.
Good night.
- He's OK.
- Oh, Wallace.
He's OK. Now, look,
Jack'll be back in a few days.
Let's just keep it together
until he gets here.
Henry... go to bed.
Mom? What are you doing?
I was... I was just looking around.
Uh-huh.
Henry, if something were wrong...
you would tell me, wouldn't you?
What do you mean?
I mean, sometimes when we're kids,
we do things that, um...
What kind of things?
Things we feel bad about?
I don't feel bad about anything.
Look what I found.
Where did you get that?
You know where I got it.
I couldn't find it after Richard's accident.
Have you had it all this time?
It was mine before it was his.
But you knew I was looking for it.
How did you get it?
Henry?
How did you get this?
I took it. I'm sorry, Mom.
I took it because I wanted something
to remember Richard by. That's all.
So can I have it back, please?
No.
No, you can't have it back.
- But it's mine.
- Henry!
- Give it to me!
- Henry!
Henry?
- What are you doing?
- Missing someone.
Who?
Mark, did you cry at your mom's funeral?
Why?
I don't know. I figure you're expected
to cry at your mom's funeral.
- But I don't know.
- You wouldn't.
- Wouldn't what?
- Hurt her.
Do you really think I'd hurt my own...
- Oh, wait.
- What?
I just remembered.
She's not my mom any more.
She's yours. Isn't that what you said?
- She's your mother now.
- Yeah.
Your mom, my mom. What the hell?
We'll both miss her.
I'll kill you first.
Poor Mark.
So violent, so disturbed.
If you don't watch out,
they're gonna lock you up.
I could kill you now.
Go ahead. Jam it in.
Gotta push pretty hard, though.
The blood'll go right across the room.
Come on. Come on.
- Henry, have you seen...
- Dad, Dad, help me!
Mark! What the hell
do you think you're doing?
- Answer me!
- Don't be mad at Mark. He's not himself.
- You could have hurt him.
- He's the one who wants to hurt people.
Mark, I'm sorry you don't wanna be friends.
He's gonna do something.
He said he's gonna kill her.
We're gonna call
Alice Davenport and have a talk.
- You gotta believe me.
- You have got to calm down.
- Mark. Mark!
- I gotta get outta here.
- If that's the way you want it.
- You don't understand, Uncle Wallace!
You will stay in here
until you are ready to talk.
Uncle Wallace!
Uncle Wallace! Uncle Wallace!
Susan! Susan! Susan!
Susan! Susan!
No. No... Susan!
Mom, I decided to clear up the shed.
Henry, stop. Just stop.
We have to talk.
Can we go for a walk, Mom?
You know, like we did when I was little.
No. Susan!
Susan!
Susan! Susan!
Susan!
Susan!
Mark! Watch the glass! Take it easy.
Easy. Take it easy.
Mark! Mark!
- Henry?
- Yes, Mom?
You have to tell me the truth now.
- What happened the night Richard died?
- Don't you know?
- I'd like to hear it from you.
- I was downstairs playing.
Henry. Don't lie to me, all right?
Just don't lie to me.
Now you tell me...
...did you kill Richard?
What if I did?
Well, um...
- What, Mom?
- We'll get you help.
You don't look too good, Mom.
Looks like you need the help.
- You have to trust me, Henry.
- No.
No, I can't.
You just wanna send me away, don't you?
Why, no. No, I don't.
- You wanna put me in one of those places.
- No, Henry.
Well, I'd much rather die, you hear me?
I'd much rather be dead.
Henry! Henry, no.
Henry!
Henry! Henry!
Henry! Henry!
Looking for me, Mom?
- Oh, Henry.
- You really thought I was gonna jump, huh?
I guess you don't know me very well, Mom.
Henry!
Henry!
Yes, Mom?
Henry, please! No!
I'm gonna kill you.
- No! No!
- I'm gonna kill you!
Hold on, Henry. Hang on to me.
Come on! Don't let go.
Hold on, Mark.
Hang on to me! Come on!
Come on. Get up. Pull up.
Come on!
Mark! Hang on!
- Mom.
- Henry.
Mom, I love you.
Mom, I need your other hand.
Come on.
- Help me.
- Mark! Hang on.
- Help me.
- Hang on, Henry, come on!
Mom, pull me up.
- Help.
- No, Mark. No!
Mom! Mom, I love you.
Help me!
- Hang on.
- Help me.
Mom, help! Help me, please.
Henry.
- Mom.
- Henry.
Henry is gone,
and the rest of us are safe.
But sometimes, late at night...
...I find myself thinking,
not about Henry, but about Susan...
...and wondering,
if she had it to do over...
...would she make the same choice?
I guess I'll always wonder.
But I know I'll never ask.
