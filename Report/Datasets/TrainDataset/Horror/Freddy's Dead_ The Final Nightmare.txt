Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
y ou'll notice the "fasten
seat belts" sign is on.
Passing through
a little turbulence here.
Unfortunately,
We can't get up over it...
and We can't
get underneath it, so...
just hang in there.
Ex cuse me, miss?
Can I have
a different seat, please?
Oh, I'm afraid
We're full tonight, sir.
y ou're gonna have to stay put.
Thanks anyway.
He's going to make you
help him...
because you're the last.
Listen...
I really need
to change this seat.
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.
I'm afraid of heights.
Don't be a pussy.
It's not fair! I Was almost out!
Shit!
I'll get you, my pretty...
and your little soul, too!
One ticket.
Round trip.
Hurry up, boy.
y ou don't Wanna miss the bus.
No screaming
While the bus in in motion.
NoW be a good little doggy...
and go fetch!
Spencer, I Wanna make sure
you understand our situation.
In one Week,
you Walk out of here...
and I expect some changes in
your behavior When you get home.
I knoW you're hearing me.
I put you in here
because you gave me no choice.
Next time, I'll leave you here.
Thanks for the visit, Dad.
Nice job on my kid.
I expected to see
some improvement.
He isn't a Toyota.
What a jerk.
y ou OK?
y eah. Dad just came by
to lay doWn some ground rules...
for When I come home...
no more running aWay, no more
setting his cars on fire.
There are other Ways
to get his attention...
besides bloWing up the garage.
y eah. He barely even blinked.
All he Wants me to do noW
is groW up to be him...
an exact copy.
I don't feel like playing
football and date-raping coeds.
One of these days, you're going
to have to face your father.
Maggie...
look What I found
in Spencer' s room.
A pipe bomb, huh?
That? Just shoWing the kids
survival techniques.
Been confiscating stuff
like this all Week.
Where do they get it?
I'll put this doWnstairs
With the rest of the arsenal.
Weren't the police supposed
to dispose of this stuff?
The police are supposed
to do a lot of things.
-Get your hands off of me!
-Tracy!
-What's the problem?
-She Was beating on another kid.
He Was hitting on me!
She doesn't like
to be touched.
We have a session today, yes?
I have Doc's class.
Work around him.
I'm sorry, sir.
y ou seen this junkie before?
No. He's neW.
Beautiful. Another afternoon
shot doing juvie paperwork.
ScreW that shit.
Let's just scoop him up
and take him to the shelter.
Let the bleeding hearts
do the typing.
That's it. Come on, Tracy.
That's it.
Oh, yeah. She's bad.
The croWd loves her!
She's getting ready...
for the heavyweight champion
boxing match of the World.
Hey, hey, hey. Look at her go.
y ou knoW, you are sexy
When you sWeat.
y ou ain't gettin' none, Carlos!
y ou Wouldn't hit a guy
With a handicap, Would you?
Oh, you call it a handicap?
I call it chicken, man!
Come on, let's spar.
-No, no. Forget it, Trace.
-Come on...
Don't tune out. Why don't you
talk back to her for once?
Oh, yeah, right. Like you
talk back to your father?
Let me tell you something.
I stopped talking back...
When it became hazardous
to my health, you knoW?
So, are We set?
y eah. No problem.
I gave the van driver our cash.
As long as We do it before daWn,
We're home free.
We're gonna be livin' large
in Cali before the Week is out.
y ou better be sure, man.
Trust me, all right?
I got it all covered.
I need to get outta here
even more than you do.
y ou don't knoW shit
about needing to get out!
y our family's a picnic,
rich boy!
What? y ou think I hang around
you morons by choice?
Least your father
didn't try to set you up...
With his girlfriend's
older sister.
Don't talk to me about fathers.
y ours come to visit, too?
y eah...
every time I close my eyes.
That did it. y ep. OK.
They caught
one of your star pupils...
beating up
on one of our kids again.
Thought you said
you Were making progress.
I only get tWenty-three minutes
a Week With these kids.
With that kind of attention...
you're lucky
she didn't kill him.
That's a good attitude
for a therapist.
Tracy's got some deep trauma
buried inside of her head.
Conventional therapy
is not going to Work.
And dream therapy is, huh?
y ou're such a hippie.
I can reach these kids
through their dreams.
y ou give me a chance, I can help
you With your little problem.
I don't have a little problem.
I just have
a little reoccurring dream...
and I'm handling it fine.
And you are not being paid
to be a dream doctor.
I'm barely being paid.
That's Why I gotta do
What I think is right.
This is neW.
y ou like it?
These are ancient dream demons.
Supposedly they roam
the dreams of the living...
till they find
the most evil, tWisted...
human imaginable.
Then they give him
the poWer to cross the line...
and turn our nightmares
into reality.
Maggie, cops just brought in
another kid. Real mess.
Hasn't sleep for days,
bad case of amnesia.
We need your evaluation
right aWay.
HoW long have you been aWake?
As far as I can remember?
I don't knoW. About three days.
Looks more like three Weeks.
y eah, Well,
that's the Wonder of amnesia...
alWays keeps you guessing.
Where you from?
I don't knoW!
All I knoW
is that Wherever I'm from...
I Was the last.
The last What?
Survivor.
Look, do you have any...
caffeine pills or coffee?
Maybe some coke?
I meant the soda.
Sit doWn.
Why do you Want to stay aWake?
Because if I fall asleep...
I'm not Waking up.
Why do you think that?
I don't think it. I feel it.
If I fall asleep...
there's gonna be trouble.
SpringWood.
Water toWer.
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-seven
Bottles of beer on the Wall
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-seven
Bottles of beer
If one of those bottles
should happen to fall
What a case of...
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-six
Bottles of beer on the Wall
I Won't tell.
NoW you're it.
Remember What you have to do.
y ou got to tag me.
That's it.
Come to Daddy.
Play With me.
Tell me Who I am.
I Won't tell.
Free me, you idiot!
I'm your fucking memory!
Oh, shit.
Asshole.
What Were you dreaming about?
A room.
A house.
A little girl.
Something about the toWn
from my article.
I remember a Water toWer.
The article...do you remember
Where you got it?
The little girl...
What did she look like?
BroWn hair With...
red ribbons.
I don't like it.
There's some connection betWeen
your dreams and his dreams...
and his dreams mean bad neWs.
I knoW you think I'm crazy,
but I can feel it.
Why can't anybody talk about
anything but dreams around here?
I'm so sick of hearing
about this bullshit!
y ou don't believe that.
y ou think solving this boy's
puzzle can help With your oWn.
I don't have a puzzle.
y es, you do.
And although you think
you knoW everything...
you may not be ready to face
What this boy Will shoW you.
I never said I Wanted
to go back there.
I've dealt
With amnesiacs before.
Take you to SpringWood,
it's gonna trigger something...
some spark to help you remember.
I don't need a spark to remember
that it Was a bad place.
y ou Want a spark? y ou go.
I'll stay here,
sparkless but happy.
I'll be right there With you.
Don't Worry.
Kelly, We're gonna take
the van for aWhile.
I told you not to let me
fall asleep.
Was that too much to ask for?
Go back.
Oh, my God! Pull over!
John, Wake up!
Shit. Great.
Funny meeting you here.
Nice driving.
What the hell are you guys
doing here?
Great plan, asshole.
-lt almost Worked, all right?
-I can't believe you people.
Pulling a stunt like that.
Oh, my God.
Look, the first thing We have
to do is find a telephone...
and you call Kelly
and tell him Where you are.
y ou understand?
And then We have to figure out
hoW to get you home.
Are you listening?
Don't scream at me!
It Was your driving
that almost killed us.
T Wo for a dollar, right here!
Get 'em, tWo!
T Wo for a dollar!
First I Want you to find
a phone, call Kelly...
and tell him you're all right.
Then I Want you
to get in that van...
and drive straight back
to the shelter.
Think you can handle that...
or do I have to call
the police?
Get aWay from here. y ou go aWay!
"Or do I have to call
the police?"
She ain't my mother.
We Want some peach cobbler
here and...
-There are no kids.
-What?
ToWn fair...
and there are no kids.
-So What's up, Spence?
-This phone's out of order.
So is this toWn.
y ou are not kidding.
Oh, What beautiful,
adorable children!
Would you like to come
and live With us?
It's been so long since
We've had children in the house.
So long.
This time,
I sWear it'll be different.
This time, I'll be careful...
and I'll hide you better,
so that he'll never find you.
Looky, I got your nose! Looky!
Ethel!
I Want my children back!
y ou knoW they bring him!
NoW see What you done did?!
Jesus.
-We're in T Win Peaks here.
-Definitely.
Have We seen enough?
-y eah.
-Good.
Come on, back in the van.
That's a very good idea.
NoW. Go!
Jeez.
I hope they make it.
Let's see What they can tell us
at the school.
-What?
-Somebody rang those bells.
Lucky us.
Trace, there's a map back here.
Did I say I needed a map?
I can't get over the Way
those people looked at us.
y eah, that Was Weird.
Shit.
Nice going.
Takes talent to travel
in a complete circle.
And you're making me dizzy.
Jeez.
Do you have to do that?
y ou're such a high ho,
you knoW that?
I don't play that shit.
I need all the senses I've got.
Put that fucking thing out.
It's hard enough
staying aWake...
Without you lighting up
every ten seconds.
-This relax es me.
-I'll relax you.
I'll just puncture your heart...
mess up these seats.
y ou need to get laid.
Would you like the map noW?
No, I don't need any map.
No, of course not.
-Why'd you stop?
-Look.
Oh, great.
Give me the map.
Not a Word.
Carlos, I asked you for the map!
What is this?!
I asked you for the map.
What?
y eah, Well,
the map says We're fucked.
Look, you've had tWo chances.
NoW it's my turn.
Dickhead.
Nice.
y ou'll all be expected
to pass...
both the Written
and an oral examination.
Don't disturb him.
y ou Will need to study...
this.
NoW the dates.
Got to get the dates right.
Got to keep them in order.
If you get them out of order,
you'll get very confused.
y ou Were here.
What?
Welcome...
to Freddy 10 1 .
Freddy sailed across the sea.
These dates, they're all
Within a ten-year period.
What the hell happened here?
Freddy happened here.
Here Was the crucial point.
Anybody knoW
What I'm getting at?
Anybody? Hmm?
Come on, people!
We covered this!
This is Where
they took aWay his child.
What child?
Taken aWay...
put in the toWn orphanage.
Freddy had a kid.
Freddy came back...
to look...
for more.
There's no Way out.
Not With you driving.
y eah, Well,
you didn't do much better.
No, but at least I did it
in half the time.
Come on. Where are you going?
AWay.
Look, We're just too fried
to see straight.
Let's just find Maggie.
I'm not turning myself over
for any adult supervision.
This girl's getting some rest.
In fact, I think I see my kinda
neighborhood up ahead...
empty.
y ou knoW, she's losing it.
Sad thing is,
I'm starting to like her.
That is sad.
Come on, Trace. Wait up!
This is the one.
We'll have it all to ourselves.
-Bet there's no heat.
-No plumbing, right?
y ou'll survive.
Come on.
Where you going?
Gonna go upstairs
and find a bed. Man, I'm tired.
I gotta find a bathroom.
This place makes the shelter
look like the Ritz.
Great.
Well...
at least it beats the streets,
right, Carlos?
Ohh, this is good.
I'm gonna get some sleep...
and I Will get us out of here
in the morning.
Why do you think that kid
said not to fall asleep?
'Cause he's a lame-o freak.
Miss Maggie's pet psycho.
Where the hell are you?
Why aren't you listening
to me, Carlos?
Tracy, Where are you?
Behind you.
Mama?
Maybe you don't hear so good.
Maybe I clean out your ears
for you.
No, no. Mama, please,
I've been a good boy.
y ou don't understand.
I've been good, Mama!
Don't make me deaf, Mama!
Please! I'm sorry!
I'm not.
Oh, Carlos, lend me your ear.
Give me my hearing back!
Where is it?
y-you Wouldn't do that,
Would you, man?
No, no, no! Please!
No, man!
Nice hearing from you, Carlos.
I can't find Carlos.
See What's on this TV?
I'm gonna take the van.
I'm gonna look for him.
Give me some room!
Don't fall asleep, man!
Get out!
Spencer, get out, man!
Carlos, man...
We Were just looking for you.
Don't fall asleep, man!
Spencer, you stupid stoner!
We shouldn't even be here.
We're supposed to be
finding out about you...
not some dead killer' s kid.
We might be talking
about the same thing.
The Whole toWn's obsessing
on this Krueger character.
Don't you start.
But Why else
Would they be afraid of me?
Why else am I still alive
When everybody else is dead?
Skip, skip, skip to my loo
Skip to my loo, my darling
Martha, no running.
Everyone hold hands.
Oh, you've come back.
HoW nice.
Do you remember me?
Well, of course I do, my boy.
I remember
every one of my children.
Especially you.
What a pretty little girl
you were.
And I remember you...
and you.
Do you remember
the Krueger child?
Of course.
Who Was it?
We're not permitted to disclose
a child's real identity.
Oh, Melissa. Melissa.
y ou must let Bobby
have the ball.
Come here. That's all right.
We share.
I Wonder Who has a little
bare footie around here?
"K. Krueger."
Could mean anything
from Kevin to Kyle.
All it really means is there Was
a child here by that name.
No. It's me.
I'm his kid.
That's Why he's kept me alive.
He's trying to play
some sick game With me.
He is dead, all right?
He's dead,
and you're not his kid.
HoW do you knoW?
She remembered me.
She remembered me, too...
and fifty other
imaginary friends.
Let's get out of here.
Let's draW a picture.
We can draW pictures all day.
There you go.
Clippety-clop, clippety-clop.
Isn't that fun?
I can't believe I found you.
What are you still doing here?
I can't find Carlos...
and Spencer' s Wasted
at this old house.
We gotta get to them
before Freddy does.
-Who's Freddy?
-I'll tell you on the Way.
Come on!
God damn it!
All right. Once again.
This is your brain.
This is your brain...
on drugs.
Questions?
y eah! What are you on?
Looks like a frying pan
and some eggs to me.
Hey, Spence.
Let's trip out.
Cool.
NoW he's gone!
He must've fallen asleep.
y ou tWo look here and upstairs.
I'm gonna look doWnstairs.
They're not here anymore.

Great graphics.
Whoa. I'm here.

OK, hold him doWn.
Oh, shit.
Hold on. Hold on to him.
-What's happening to him?
-He's stuck in a nightmare.
And it's kicking
the shit out of him!
-Wake him up.
-He's too Wasted.
-Spencer! Jesus.
-lt's Freddy.
We've got to get him out.
I'll go into his dream.
I'll try and bring him out
before he gets killed.
That's crazy.
What do you call that, rational?
Right...left.
Right, left, right, left. PoW!
He's getting trashed.
I have to go in.
What about Freddy?
Freddy Won't hurt me.
I'm family.
OK, so hoW are you gonna go in?
Well...
you're gonna have to lay me out.
What? What is th...
-Just fucking lay me out!
-Wait a second!
-Doc told me a different Way.
-No time to talk! Just do it!
Jesus Christ.
I told you I kneW an easier Way.
Concentration meditation.
That's What Doc alWays says.
This place is incredible.
PoW! Bam! Splat!
Is that him?
Jump, boy.
OW! Stop!
Oh, shit! Spencer!
Come on, John! Let go of me!
Get out of here! NoW, Tracy!
Hey, y ou forgot the poWer glove.
PoW!
Boing, boing.

I beat my high score.
Great to be back in business...
thanks to you.
Daddy's Waiting for you,
little girl.
Shut the fuck up, man!
Spencer' s gone.
I couldn't stop it.
John's still in there.
I couldn't Wake him up.
Come on! Snap out of it!
What are We gonna do?
We're gonna pick him up
and get the hell out of here!
Not again.
He's not gonna get me again.
Nothing is gonna
make me get off this bed.
Damn it!
I hate this house.
Up here!
I knoW Why you let me go.
Do you think I'm your daddy?
Wrong!
But you let me live.
Only long enough for you
to bring me back my daughter.
y our daughter?
And noW...
she's gonna take me
to a Whole neW playground.
Grounded!
Oh, my God, Maggie!
What's going on?
Come on, Maggie. Let's go!
Come...
Let's get out of here!
Let's get the hell out of here!
It...it's not a boy.

Come on!
We gotta get out of here!
NoW! Come on!

but I knoW Where you're going.
It's traveling time!
What's Wrong?
Maggie, get in the van!
Come on!
We gotta get the hell
out of here!
Oh, God.
Let's go!
Whatever happened...
it Wasn't your fault.
Carlos, Tracy, and Spencer...
stoWed aWay in the back
of the shelter van.
They Were trying to escape.
Can you believe it?
So I took them to the phone.
They Were supposed to call you.
John Doe and I Were gonna
check out the school.
But Tracy got separated.
And then they ran aWay.
What the hell
are you talking about?
I'm talking about Carlos
and Spencer and the John Doe!
Kelly, they just disappeared!
Been handling
too many cases, Maggie.
Those kids Were never here.
I Would've remembered
any neW arrivals.
Kelly, I'm talking about
forty-eight hours ago.
I brought you a John Doe.
Don't tell me
you don't remember that!
y ou the one Who's handling
too many cases!
Get some rest, Maggie.
And then...
We got back and...
no one remembers John or Carlos.
It's like they never existed.
I've been hearing strange shit.
Like some of the kids
are dreaming about Carlos.
And they don't even
remember him.
I remember him.
Why?
Because I can control my dreams.
I'm not fooled
by this thing you saW.
Whatever he is...
he's fucking With the line
betWeen dreams and reality.
He didn't just kill Carlos
and the others.
He erased them.
It's not a boy.
Mother!
Shit.
y ou're getting ready
to kill somebody.
Defend myself.
It's your mind he'll go for.
y our fear.
I kneW it, I kneW it, I kneW it.
Maggie, What are you doing?
Who are they?
Let me have that.
-I have to knoW.
-I don't knoW.
I don't knoW Who they Were.
They Wouldn't tell me.
They have rules
about no contact.
Oh, there's been contact.
Find me.
Find Daddy.
y ou're it.
Come to Daddy.
I Won't tell.
Oh, God.
Fred, please...
I Won't tell.
We need to talk, Loretta.
Go inside, honey.
I Won't tell.
I told you never...
never to go in there.
I told you that! I told you.
Catherine.
y ou Were such a little artist.
No, it can't be.
I knoW Who I am.
y ou're my blood.
Only you could have
brought me out...
in your mind.
But you can't be my father.
They took you aWay from me...
but I made 'em pay!
I took all their children
aWay from them...
and noW...
that's over.
Come on.
The shelter.
Time to start all over again.
But this isn't SpringWood!
Every toWn...
has an Elm Street.
Tracy girl...
Daddy's home.
Daddy...you're dead.
I'm home, darling.
Come say hello.
I don't Want to, Daddy.
Come on, give Daddy some honey.
No one has to knoW.
y ou're not my daddy.
Come on, Tracy.
Here! Do you love me noW?
He's dead!
My daddy's dead.
No honey for Daddy?
What's With kids today, huh?
No respect.
y ou can't scare me anymore.
Oh, you better speak up.
Must be my deaf ear.
Kung fu this, bitch.
This is my dream,
and I do What I Want.
Might be your dream...
but it's my rules!
Doc...I need to talk to Doc!
Come on!
Doc? Doc, is that you?
y eah, Tracy. Where are you?
I'm over here
in one of the lockers.
y ou gotta get me out!
Where the hell are you?
Right here.
y ou taught her a lot...
but there's so much more
to learn.
HoW about this, Doc?
Sticks and stones
may break my bones...
but nothing Will ever kill me.
Well, let's see noW.
First they tried burning me.
Then they tried burying me.
But this...this is my favorite.
They even tried holy Water.
But I just keep on tickin'...
because they promised me that.
They?
The dream people.
The ones that gave me this job.
In dreams...
I am forever!
Too bad you're not.
Thank God.
I think I've got a Way
to get him.
So What's the plan, Doc?
Thanks.
y ou can't get him
in the dream...
but if this can come out,
he can come out.
And if he can come out,
he can bleed.
-And die.
-Right.
HoW Will you knoW
When I got him?
I'm gonna find you With this...
and then I'm bringing you out.
y ou've got to be holding him
to carry him out.
I knoW.
He's gonna try and trick you
just like Tracy.
He'll try to use your eyes
to fool you.
y ou'll use these.
Get the hell outta here.
y ou Want to live?
These mean nothing here...
but in a dream,
they can be anything you Want.
He got inside your head.
y ou get inside of his.
That's my job, isn't it?
Be careful. He's good at
finding out What hurts the most.
Exactly.
That's Why you gotta take me
With you.
I can't.
It's gotta be me and him.
All right, Doc.
Put me in.
Strap her in.
Take a deep breath.
Good.
Ten...
nine...
eight...
seven...
six...
five...
four...
three...
tWo...
one.
Get inside his brain.
I'm in his memories.
Son of a hundred maniacs
y ou ready for it, boy?
y ou been a Waste
since the day I took you in.
NoW it's time
to take your medicine.
Thank you, sir.
May I have another?
y ou Want to knoW
the secret of pain?
If you just stop feeling it...
you can start using it.
Child killer!
We knoW What you Want.
I Want it all!
Of course you do.
Then open up.
And you shall be forever!
Mommy!
Don't Worry, baby.
Mommy just had
to take her medicine...
for snooping
in Daddy's special Work.
But you Won't tell, Will you?
I Won't tell.
But you did tell, didn't you?
And noW it's time
to take your medicine.
y ou killed my mother!
She's got him!
Let's get her out of there.
I've got you!
I had him!
Where the hell is he?
Maybe the trip killed him.
No...because
I'm still seeing things...
the Way I did in my dream.
It's not over. Let's go.
The cops Were supposed
to pick this stuff up.
I'm glad they didn't.
We'll have to hit him
With everything We've got.
