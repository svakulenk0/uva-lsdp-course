Peaceful up here, in't it?
Oh, I'd love to live out in the country.
Wouldn't you, Jimmy?
Would I 'eck!
- Why not?
- It's dead.
Nowt to do.
Just imagine living down there.
Take you an hour
to get to t'nearest boozer.
Oh, I know, but the air's lovely.
Oh, do you know, I love it
this time of year with spring coming on.
See the leaves just coming out
on that bush over there?
What are you looking at?
Trying to make out where our house is.
Wish I had a pair of binoculars.
You can see t'floodlights at United.
- What time is it?
- T'half-time scores will be on.
Oh, honestly!
We're surrounded by all this countryside
and all you can think about is football?
- It's not all I can think about.
- Oh, stop it.
You've got no consideration at all,
sometimes.
You think you can do what you like.
Where are you going?
There you are. It's a peace offering.
- Not much smell to it, though.
- It's lovely.
Heather's supposed to bring good luck.
- It's what they say.
- Wonder if it'll bring me any.
- Are you being serious?
- Of course I am.
I've never been more serious in my life.
Jimmy.
- Are you sure?
- Not definitely.
I'm normally as regular as clockwork.
Anyway, what if I am?
It's not the end of the world, is it?
- And don't forget No.24 today.
- What?
I said don't forget No.24 today. You're
gonna ruin your hearing wi' them things.
Honestly, Jimmy,
you want your bloody head seeing to.
I think he wants
something else seeing to as well.
- Don't blame me. It's not my fault.
- Whose fault is it, you daft bugger?
Don't go blaming it all on Ruth, Jimmy.
That's not fair.
It's irrelevant who's to blame now.
- There you are.
- Ta.
The point is,
what are you going to do about it?
We're gonna get married.
What for?
Because we want to. What do you think?
You don't have to, you know, Jimmy.
I wouldn't want you thinking
we were pushing you into it.
Nobody's pushing us into owt.
It's what we want. We've decided.
I suppose you've talked
about an abortion?
Of course we have,
but neither of us want that.
We wanna get married and have t'baby.
- What does that mean? Abortion.
- Michael...
Never mind what it means. Get on with
your game. It's nothing to do with you.
We were thinking
of getting engaged anyway.
It don't make much difference, really,
it's just brought it forward a bit, that's all.
I hope you know what you're doing,
Jimmy.
It's a hell of a time to be starting a family,
in the middle of a recession.
- What are you doing with that?
- I'm not hurting it.
- Our Jimmy's getting married.
- Are you?
- I might be. Why?
- Well, it's a bit sudden, in't it?
- You're not even engaged.
- How do you know?
It's nowt to do wi' you,
so keep your nose out.
Are you getting married in a church
or a registry office?
Alison, what's an abortion?
- Michael, I've told you once...
- Oh, so that's it.
I'll give you a good hiding
if you don't keep your mouth shut.
- What for? I ain't done anything yet.
- Are you gonna shut up about it?
I hope you two are both satisfied now.
What are you blaming me for?
I haven't done anything wrong.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Hang about.
Come on.
Do you think we'll get on all right?
I can't see why not. They're ever so nice.
I wish we were meeting
in different circumstances, that's all.
You're making it sound like a funeral.
Well, it is a bit embarrassing, isn't it?
It ought to have been a happy occasion.
It is a happy occasion.
Well, I'm happy, anyway.
I must say, it's brought out
a very determined streak in you, has this.
Mother.
Didn't you hear what I said, Gordon?
Mr. and Mrs. Kemp are here.
Come on, turn the television off.
You can't watch while they're here.
- Oh, hello.
- Do come in.
- Mum, Mrs. Kemp, Mr. Kemp.
- Pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Jimmy, my dad. Mr. and Mrs. Kemp.
- Oh, hello.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Mrs. Kemp?
- Do go through.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
- Come in.
It's in a bit of a state
but it's got possibilities.
I'd have that door stripped down,
all this paper off and the walls white.
There's about 16 layers on here.
My mother and dad'll help us,
I'm sure they will.
My dad'll give us a hand as well.
He'll be glad of summat to do.
What you laughing at?
His face when my mother said
we could borrow his redundancy money.
Don't.
He were fancying a trip to Bermuda on it.
- Looks like being Blackpool again.
- Oh, dear.
I like the gardens. It's lovely for children
to have somewhere to play.
I wonder if they'll let me
build an aviary down there.
Oh, you and your birds.
Makes you feel funny, though, don't it?
What do you mean?
Us owning a home,
being married, having children.
- Enough to put years on you, in't it?
- Don't be silly.
It'll be lovely.
I just know it will.
- Here you are, love.
- Ta.
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.
Hello.
Mary, contact the following people and
have them in my office in ten minutes.
They're to get here right away.
Is that clear?
Right. You got a pencil? OK.
Alan Boulton, George Cox,
Roger Fisher, Susan Russell...
Yes, Administration,
Tony Barnes, Roy Chamberlain...
It's busy for a Wednesday, in't it?
You'd think it were Christmas.
What about the food situation?
What have we got?
And what about flour?
What else is there?
Corned beef.
I hope it's not from Argentina.
OK, what about supplies
to the first-aid post?
Is that all? Well, that's not
going to get us very far, is it?
What?
Well, I'm sure I don't know if I'm honest.
We've heard nothing
about emergency powers as yet.
Anyway, don't make a song and dance
about it. Just get on with it.
And don't tell anybody
you don't have to, eh? OK.
- All right?
- All right.
All right, John?
- Come to give me a hand, then?
- No chance. I'm knackered.
Not too knackered to be going out,
though, I see.
It's different, in't it?
I need a break. I've been down at t'house
every night this week.
- How's it coming on?
- Not too bad.
Trying to get t'living room
and bedroom finished.
Ruth says will you take some flowers
down when you've finished?
- Third since teatime.
- Aye.
- Where they going to?
- Finningley, I suppose.
Pop down to WH Smith's and
buy yourself an aircraft spotter's book.
Make a change from gardening.
You can laugh
but there's summat going on.
There'll be summat going on tonight
after a few pints.
Don't be going mad. You haven't only
got yourself to think about.
Why not? Might as well enjoy myself
while I'm single.
- Not long to go now, you know.
- You could be right there.
- Come on.
- I'll have a half.
Half? What's up with you? Getting
into training for when you're married?
Two bitters, please. Cheers.
Hey, I were watching that.
Turn it back again.
I were watching about t'Far East
and he turns it over.
- Far East? What's going on there?
- Iran. The Americans have just...
Iran? That's not the Far East, you pillock,
that's the Middle East.
China, Hong Kong, that's the Far East.
So what? It's far enough, in't it?
Sooner go to t'Near East myself.
Scarborough and Skegness.
Skeggy? I'd rather watch
my toenails grow than go there.
Never mind that rubbish.
What about these two birds sat there?
- You're dead right. It's getting serious.
- There's nowt we can do about it.
Might as well enjoy ourselves
whilst we can.
Don't it scare you, what it might lead to?
Yeah, but there's nowt
we can do about it, is there?
If the bomb does drop, I wanna be pissed
out of my mind and underneath it.
Come on, you miserable bugger.
It's all these family responsibilities.
- You're acting like a married man.
- It'll not be long now.
You might as well make t'best of it
whilst you can.
What about
chatting these two birds up, then?
- I can't do that.
- Come on. It might be your last chance.
Anyway, if we are gonna cop it,
might as well go out with a bang.
Can't be many better ways of going,
I suppose. Blown up on t'job.
To the Director of Technical Services.
Please let me know what fuel stocks
are held in each depot.
Please ensure tanks are topped up and
fuel is used for essential works only.
Jobs not bombs!
Jobs not bombs!
They are playing with, at best,
the destruction of life as we know it,
and at worst, total annihilation.
You cannot win a nuclear war.
Now, just suppose
the Russians win this war.
What exactly would they be winning?
What would they have conquered?
Well, I'll tell you.
All major centers of population
and industry will have been destroyed.
What industry?
We ain't got no industry in Sheffield.
Yes, and if the money hadn't...
If the money hadn't been spent on
nuclear weapons, you'd have industry.
Get back to bloody Russia!
Where's your red flag?
We'd have put money into welfare,
found alternative sources of energy.
Industry...
Industry will have been destroyed,
oil refineries will have been destroyed,
all our water will have been polluted,
the soil will have been irradiated,
farm stock will be dead,
diseased or dying.
The Russians would have conquered
a corpse of a country.
Let us pray.
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come...
They were only 26p last week.
Shop somewhere else
if you're not satisfied.
There's a national emergency
and you're lining your pockets.
Nobody's forcing you to buy 'em.
Put 'em back on t'shelves.
Yes, I will. I'd sooner starve first.
Excuse me, love.
- They've started fighting, Mum.
- Who has?
The Americans and the Russians.
It's just been on the news.
My dad says
you've got to come home now.
Hey, you haven't paid
for them things.
All right?
- Are you all right, love?
- It's noisy.
It must be t'pubs turning out.
Doing a moonlight flit, then?
No, we're going to our Jack's in
Lincolnshire while things get sorted out.
We should be safer over there.
Carol, stop messing about.
Come inside and do something to help.
We'll not be safe anywhere,
as far as I see.
I don't know. We've a better chance
of surviving in t'country, haven't we?
Where our Jack lives
there's only a row of houses and a pub.
I don't think they're gonna bomb that.
- I think that's about it, Ron.
- Mum!
- Carol!
- Have you turned that gas off?
We don't want
the whole street blowing up.
- Come on, Carol.
- Spot! I'm coming.
I can't find our Spot.
He was here a minute ago.
Have you looked inside?
I've looked upstairs,
along t'street, next door's garden.
It's ridiculous, all this. Spot?
- Spot?
- He was here a minute ago.
- Come on.
- He'll be here in a minute. I know he will.
- Spot! Come on!
- Come on, love.
- Spot!
- We're going without him.
- Oh, Mum, tell him. Mum!
- Honestly!
- Spot!
- You're being a right fool.
- Nothing'll happen.
- We're not standing about all day.
- Get in.
- Don't be so cruel. We can't leave him.
- Spot!
- Carol, get in.
- Get in!
- Spot! Spot! Come on, Spot!
- See you, then, Bill.
- Let's hope so.
Sutton here.
Yes, I understand.
Do I have to go right away?
No? When?
Yes, I see.
All right, love.
Take your time.
- We're trying to get to Lincolnshire.
- Not this way.
Essential services only.
You'll have to find another route.
That's bloody ridiculous.
You can't stop people like that.
Excuse me. Where are you going?
Sorry, love, you can't...
- You can't stop...
- Tell you what.
Try Junction 35/36 of the M1.
They've opened up the hard shoulder.
It'll be chock-a-block.
If I were you I'd go home and sit tight.
That's what
they're advising people to do.
I've put half a dozen in.
I can fetch some more if you like.
No, that'll be plenty.
Well, tell him to improvise, then. Right.
- Do you think anything will happen?
- No, it's just a precaution.
Have you had a shave this morning?
You should never have said you'd do it.
You don't have to.
You won't get the sack if you refuse.
Look, Marjorie,
it's difficult for me as well, you know.
I don't want to go
and leave you and the children.
Well, then, why are you going?
Somebody's got to pick up the pieces if...
Why didn't you say something before
if you were worried about it?
You never said anything
when I went on those courses.
Sutton here.
Yes, in half an hour's time.
I should be going off now, if I were you.
The roads will be getting busy.
Well, use your common sense, man.
How should I know?
Marjorie, leave that.
I'll ring you later.
What?
Yes. Yes.
It is imperative,
while there is still time left,
that the TUC call a general strike
in protest against this disaster
which faces us all.
- That's what'll destroy this country!
- There is still time to avert disaster
if we act resolutely and show
both the Russians and the Americans
that we will have no truck
with their warmongering.
- What about the Falklands?
- What about the Falklands?
There's nobody more patriotic than I am.
I've been trying to get us
out of the Common Market.
But first...
Please do not play into their hands.
This is a peaceful demonstration.
We are exercising
our right of free speech.
The police have no right
to stop this demonstration.
Do not play into their hands.
You have no...
Tin openers! £1.50 a go.
Come on, all of you.
£1.50 could save your life!
- Morning, Clive.
- Morning, Alan. What's it like?
- It's a bit primitive. Take a look.
- We'll get it organized.
Where the hell is everybody?
- You know Steve, Information Officer?
- Where are they?
- Jeff's car's broken down.
- That's no good, is it?
- How many missing?
- About ten.
Get on the phone.
I want 'em here immediately.
- Which is my desk?
- Straight through.
Mind your head.
No sign of the Emergency Committee.
You know
what those councilors are like.
- They're not getting paid for this.
- This is the best I could do.
Dr. Talbot, Regional Health Authority.
- How are things going?
- We're doing our best.
Can you pass us that...
- You all right, love?
- I've just been sick again.
Oh, I feel awful.
I think I'll go back to bed.
Don't worry about it, love.
It'll only last for a week or two.
No.
I'll ring work and tell them
you're not coming in.
If anybody's there.
There were only one or two yesterday.
It's worse than before.
I can't get anything now.
The line's dead.
We ought to be getting the rest
of the things out of the cellar now.
Hello, County. This is Sheffield District.
Testing, one, two, three, four.
Please report my signal. Over.
Whose responsibility is it?
We've all got families.
Look, just get down here.
There's nine other people.
I've got a serious public order problem.
I need at least an extra six PSUs.
Yeah, but when?
Look, I'm using traffic wardens already.
I ought to take this one off as well.
It'll get scratched to pieces.
It's only just been painted.
- Better than getting blown to pieces.
- Shall I go to school, Mum?
What did it say on t'telly? I can't
remember if it said schools were closed.
It said on the news we're to stay at home.
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am.
- They're sending notes out.
- Is there time?
Great. I had a history test this morning.
Alison, go to Kirby's
and see if they've got any food left.
- Like what?
- Anything. Bring what you can.
- Take my purse.
- Dad, you gonna build one of these?
Over my dead body.
I want to know something more definite
before we rip this place to pieces.
- Can I help you?
- Here. Hold that.
We'll be able to sleep in it.
It'll be like going camping.
Nearly all the supermarket shelves
are empty,
but we've got the warehouses
controlled by the police.
As yet we haven't located all the
root vegetable clumps on local farms,
but stocks of sugar,
wheat, flour and rice...
- Is it for real?
- It's for bloody real.
Get to your stations.
Get that generator going!
Lock the doors.
As soon as you can, every scrap
of information you've got on casualties.
- Get your heads down.
- We can't sell you any timber.
It's a joinery, not a timber yard.
You can't just have a piece of that.
Come on, quick. Get down.
- These have gone. Everything's dead.
- What about t'tellies?
- Why didn't you pull the aerial out?
- Get the standbys working.
Come on.
Bloody hell.
Hold on, Gordon. You're going too fast.
Come on! That might just be t'start of it.
Jesus Christ, they've done it.
They've done it.
- Where are you going?
- To find Ruth. See if she's all right.
Oh, shit.
- Come on. Move it inside.
- What about all these?
Get the mattress on the bottom.
That's right. Put it down there.
Where's our Alison?
- This one's on Finningley.
- A brown burst.
- Four-three.
- What was the other power station?
Hang on.
There's something on the airport, I think.
Shine the torch further down.
Ruth, come down here
and give us a hand.
Ruth, come and help
your grandma!
Ruth, please!
It'll be all right.
Come on. All this stuff on.
Put that on. Come on, then.
Ruth!
Come on.
Michael! Michael!
Take it easy. Don't hurry.
Ah, that's the girl. Well done.
It won't be long now.
Well done, Gordon.
How long can you keep that going?
- Two weeks if we're careful.
- First-aid kit, quickly.
We've lost County again, I think.
Aerials must have blown.
They were on the roof.
Switch the lights off when you get there.
Can we raise any districts? Radio amps?
- Can we improvise an aerial?
- We'll try.
Let's do something quick.
- Where's the first-aid kit?
- On this shelf at the back.
I've looked out here. I can't shift a thing.
- How is he?
- I can't find the first-aid kit.
Forget the first-aid kit. Bring me
something to cover him up with.
- There.
- No!
Leave me.
Everybody all right?
Mother?
Jesus Christ, another one.
This could go on for ever.
It's Stocksbridge police.
What about rescue?
Is there anything you can do? Over.
Give me another bin liner.
- What is your RADIAC reading?
- What about the depot?
I repeat, what is your RADIAC reading?
Over.
- 100.
It's too high.
You've got to get your men under cover.
Can you get us through to
the County Central Headquarters? Over.
Can you patch us through? Over.
Stocksbridge, are you receiving me?
Over.
- Green, I think.
- Have you heard anything from them?
Ask if they've got casualties.
They've lost them.
What about Hillsborough
and Stocksbridge?
- That far out? Jesus Christ!
- Ask him where the last one was.
- Switch that thing off, Gordon.
You all right, Ruth?
Ruth?
I couldn't help it. It just came on.
Don't worry about it, love.
It's not your fault. We've all got it.
I know, but I'm so ashamed.
Messing the bed at my age.
- It's the shock, isn't it?
- It's like being a little baby again.
Lie down.
Come and help me clean Grandma.
Ruth, be careful with that.
You don't know long it'll have to last us.
Ruth, don't just sit there. Do something.
Oh! Urgh!
Michael.
Michael... I've got to find him, Bill.
You stop here
and I'll go and look for him.
You stop here.
I'll only be out a few minutes.
- Stop here, love.
- No, I've got to come. No.
- Help me.
- All right.
Oh, my God.
Michael?
Michael?
We haven't heard from County HQ
for two days.
Who the hell else have you tried?
- Send another motorcycle.
- There are no roads left.
- All the people here will be dead.
Round here 50 per cent will be alive
but here they're as good as dead already.
They've probably received a lethal dose.
- What about here?
- It'll be pretty heavy there.
If the wind's still blowing from the
southwest it's in direct line from Crewe.
Depends what sort of cover they've built.
If they've got a decent cellar
we'll get it on the radio.
There's no way of getting anything out.
Listen.
Yeah. Yes, I'll pass the message on.
What am I expected to do?
I can't get anything out, can I?
Listen. I've got a message
from Rivelin Valley police.
They've managed to get through
to the works depot.
They've got some vehicles on the road
but they're nearly out of fuel.
What the hell
have they been doing with it all?
They didn't tell me. They want to know
where they can get some more.
- And they've got no food.
- Oh, God.
- I've got...
- Let me get on with it, OK?
Here you are, Mother.
Something to eat for you.
Better leave her. The rest'll do her good.
At least it won't go cold.
Ruth.
Ruth, love.
Come on, love.
You'll have to eat something.
But you'll have to, love.
It's not just you now, you know.
The baby needs some food as well.
Come on.
I don't care about this baby any more.
- Oh, Ruth.
- I wish it was dead.
- Don't say things like that.
- There's no point with Jimmy dead.
- But you don't know.
- He is. He is. I know he is.
You can't be certain.
We're breathing in all this radiation
all the time.
My baby. It will be ugly and deformed.
Oh, Michael. Alison and Jimmy.
All of them gone.
Alison... Michael...
- All dead.
- No. We don't know that.
They might be safe somewhere.
I wish I were dead. I wish it were me.
I wish I could swap places with him.
Right. Let's get in.
Watch that bloody water.
How far does this go back?
If four floors have come down
it could go back for yards and yards.
Try it again, Gordon.
Still nothing coming through.
It must be blocked further up.
How much stuff
do you think's on top of us?
- When can you get to us?
- What about the army?
We've not heard from County.
If we don't hear soon,
we'll never get things under control.
- You try getting through to them.
- I've got starving mobs everywhere.
It's not our decision anyway.
It's up to Zone to authorize
the release of buffer stocks...
- We can't get through to County.
- Are we going to let them starve?
We're on our own. You've got
the authority. Do something with it.
Why waste food
on people who are going to die?
I agree with Clive.
The food stocks won't last long.
A lot of people didn't stock up.
How could they? The shops were empty.
They're coming out of the shelters. We
should hang on to the food we've got.
I need that food to force people to work.
- Make us a cup of tea, Sharon.
- Make it yourself. I'm not your wife.
Anybody got a fag?
- Bad for your health.
I don't care
how much trouble they're causing.
We're not sending our men in there
with that radiation.
What's the point? They're all gonna die
on that patch anyway.
Bill, just get me a drink. Please, a drink.
I'll see if I can find anything.
I won't be long.
Just a minute. Just a minute.
- For God's sake.
- Just a minute, love. That's it.
- Oh, God. Look at it.
- Just a minute. Just a minute.
Can you manage? That's it.
All right, put her down here.
Give us one of the blankets.
Come on. Oh, my God.
- Ruth?
- Ruth!
Ruth!
Ruth!
Come on, down you go.
Careful.
Mandy! Mandy!
Have you see our Mandy?
Mandy! Mandy!
Mum! Mum!
Mum! Mum! Mum!
Mum!
What time is it?
Half past two.
Night or day?
Night, I think.
I'm not sure. I'm losing track.
I'm not sure
whether it's night or day any more.
Go back to your homes.
Allocation of foodstuffs
will begin shortly.
The distribution points
will be announced.
I repeat, go home.
There is nothing we can do for you.
We have no authority to distribute food.
- Who are you saving it for?
- This is a warning.
Any attempt to appropriate provisions
from these premises will be met by force.
I advise you to disperse
and go back to your homes.
Prepare to fire gas.
One round CS gas, straight at gates.
One round at that man.
Rosie! Rosie!
Diane!
Listen...
He can't do anything. Please!
Please!
Ma! Dad!
We've no choice,
as far as I see.
- Can't we get any food from outside?
- Where from?
We've told County.
Everybody's in the same boat.
We can't contact Rockley.
God knows what's happened there.
Probably been raided.
What do you think, Doctor?
We'll have to cut their rations.
I've worked it out.
and 500 for the rest.
That wouldn't keep a flea alive.
Should we be keeping anybody alive
if they can't work?
A lot of people are gonna die anyway.
Back to survival of the fittest, I suppose.
What is that in terms of food, then,
I don't know... A few slices of bread...
some soup...
a lamb chop...
a treacle tart...
a few pints of beer.
Bastards!
Look, you must have an empty factory
to put them.
No, you look. I've got thousands
of homeless people walking around.
I've got enough on with them
without worrying about criminals.
You'll have to find
somewhere to put 'em.
Well, I don't know.
Look, shoot the buggers. I don't care.
Can we get a water tank
to Broomhill? The standpipe's run dry.
Oh, Christ, Steve. This should have been
sorted out days ago.
Can we not tell them
to make their way to the rest centers?
No, there'll be no point.
They'll be overrun anyway.
What about tents?
Got any tents we could use?
Tents?! How the hell should I know?
If you want to know about tents,
go and phone the Boy Scouts.
Piss off, will you?
You're not the only one under pressure.
- I bloody know!
- You sort it!
And what the hell are you doing
about digging us out?
Bloody hell, what a stink.
Let's get out of here. I'm gonna puke.
Halt or I'll fire.
Number three,
a round for that man over there.
- Number one, go and search the house.
- Up against the wall.
- We weren't doing anything.
- You were looting.
- We were searching empty houses.
- Quiet! Shut up!
- What choice have we got?
- We were hungry.
Two bodies in the cellar.
A man and a woman.
Not been dead long.
The man's head's battered in.
It weren't us, it were him.
- Out.
- We ain't done nothing.
Number two, pick up the stolen goods.
- We were only after a bit of food.
- Check the house and search the body.
- Bag of crisps.
- What flavor?
- Prawn cocktail.
- They fucking would be. I hate them.
Come on.
I could murder a fag now.
I used to love a fag after a meal.
Have you got owt to swap?
I've got some Scotch.
Ohh. Bloody hell.
- Let me out!
- Bastard!
Let him out!
Fucking full of yourself
like a traffic warden!
Let us out!
Come on. Watch yourself here. Right.
Get that light down here.
Watch the girder. Come on.
Over here. Another one here.
- Another one over there.
- How many altogether?
About four, five, six.
Right, down there.
Come on.
- George Langley?
- What do you want?
- You have four temporary residents.
- I'm having no strangers here.
- You've no choice. It's law.
- I don't care what it is.
This is my house
and I'm having no strangers in it.
- You've got four spare rooms...
- Aye, and they're stopping spare.
They can't just walk
into people's houses. It's not right.
We're not here to argue the matter.
- You four...
- It's bloody dangerous.
They might bring
all sorts of diseases with them.
- In you go.
- They might be contaminated.
Well, look at him. Look at him.
- Look at him.
- Go on. In you go.
Right, No.19.
Get out, will you?
The whole lot of you.
- Go on!
- You've no right!
Get out, the whole lot of you!
Where are we supposed to go?
Ruth?
It is Ruth, isn't it?
I'm Bob. Jimmy's mate.
We met once or twice. Remember?
You came to our last Christmas do
at work.
Where is he?
Is he wi' you?
Have you seen him?
Is it safe to eat?
I don't know.
How can you tell?
It's got a thick coat.
That should have protected it.
You breathe it in, though, don't you?
It should be all right.
Sheep don't die of cold.
It must be radiation.
You'd be able to taste it
if it were contaminated.
Oh, I don't know.
We've no choice, have we,
unless we want to starve to death?
Oh.
- I'll take some wi' me.
- Where?
City.
There's nothing there.
North. Dales.
Doesn't really matter, does it?
It's all the same.
I'll try and skin it.
Keep me warm.
No!
Ruth.
Ruth.
Work. Work.
Work. Up.
Oi! What that be?
- Coney.
- Give us 'em. Give us 'em.
- Better, else us'll pry 'em.
- Best stand off, else tha'll get it.
Give us 'em.
Where you stopped at?
Come with us?
- Where?
- Come on. Us place.
Gaz and Spike.
Share the coney, then. Come on.
- Share the coney. Come on.
- Us place. Come on.
Come back here wi' that!
Hey, you! Come back!
Come back!
Come on, then.
Give us it. Come on.
Give us it. Come on.
Give us it. Give us it.
Give us it.
Halt. Halt!
What's wrong?
Have you been hurt?
- Baby. Coming.
- No time for babies here.
- Coming. Baby. Coming.
- No time for babies here.
You have to go home.
Use your common sense.
Coming! They're coming!
There you are.
