We understand that it did not
manage to go cross species.

Thats the point. Mom is alive.
I want to see her!
There is no question sir.
She has the virus. she`s infected.
Why isn`t she showing
any symptoms?
I dont know.

Genetic abnormality which access
some sort of natural immunity.
But the virus is still in her blood.
And its still alive.
Technically she is not immun.
She`s a carrier.
Are you saying she has
the ability to infect others?
Yes sir. Absolutely.
If this woman have natural
ammunity she incredibly valuable.
Her blood can contain the key
to a vaccine even a cure.

If the infected dont get us,
the snipers will.
But you dont have a
choice my friend.
Snipers can see you through
thier night scopes.
At least you have limited
cover from the infected.
But if you wanna wait for sun up.
Then you are good as dead.
