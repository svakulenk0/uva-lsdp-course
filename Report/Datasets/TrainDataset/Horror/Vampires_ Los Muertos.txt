Little party, mister?
Baby, you passed the audition.
Hey! Slow down!
lt's $50 straight up.
You want more, it costs more.
And l don't do no audition.
Scream and it's over.
Hey, ba--
lf l pull this trigger...
...l bet it's gonna hurt you
really bad.
What do you think?
Now, razor boy...
...why don't you just move away,
nice and slow.
Jesus.
Thanks, mister. You saved my life.
-What can l do for you?
-Smile, sister.
-Derek?
-Hey, man.
Some anonymous somebody
wants to bankroll a unit.
A whole unit for something
nobody believes in?
-Must be the Catholics.
-Yeah, maybe.
Bunch of them got wiped out
years ago.
-So what's the gig?
-North Mexico.
Sucker count's way up.
Client wants a strike so they don't
move up to San Diego or Tucson.
Who's the client?
Anonymous means
anonymous, Derek.
Aw, hell, Catholics, feds, Hindus....
-As long as they pay, who cares?
-Why are we getting all this action?
-Big guys are mostly dead.
-Since they stick their necks out.
-I work alone.
-It won't happen unless it's a team.
They don't want cowboys, they want
hunters. It's gotta be a unit.
There was a priest who
survived that massacre.
You might wanna build your team
around him.
-Who are you?
-Why don't you ask them?
-They know my pulse, blood type--
-l apologize.
-We had to make sure you were--
-Human?
My name's Derek Bliss.
l'm looking for Father Adam Guiteau.
You've nothing to fear f rom me.
He's hiding here. l can keep a secret.
Have l found him?
When?
-Last month.
-How?
-How is not important.
-How is important.
You're a hunter?
Then you know the life.
-You're a hunter?
-l dabbled when l was younger...
...and backed away.
You should stay the night.
There's nowhere else nearby.
Perhaps l can help in some way.
lt's all right to talk.
You saw something!
Hallucination. lt was just--
-Real for a second?
-Yeah.
One of them is trying
to link with you.
You must resist with all your power,
or it will destroy you.
This one's dead.
This one's crazy.
These two are good.
The others, never heard about them.
Stay small. Fewer targets.
You sure you won't come?
Sorry. lf you return,
l'll bless the team.
Thanks, Padre, but l can pick that up
along the way.
Lester Pomani?
Hello?
Brody, listen.
That priest you sent me to see? Dead.
The first two guys on the list? Dead.
I took those names out of my
Rolodex. Nobody else ever saw them.
-Then how did the bogeys know?
-Try one more.
I'll make some calls and see
who I can recruit. Just one more?
l'm looking for Augie Tilton.
l know who did it!
They run in the church.
-Who's gonna help me? Who's gonna--?
-Hey, buddy, slow down a minute.
l know some things
about the kids in there.
Like what?
Like maybe you'd better wait
till the sun comes up.
Just sit tight.
Hey, maybe you should
just talk to them.
-What's your name?
-Sancho.
Sancho, your f riend was doing
some special undercover work.
l'm finishing the job.
-Who are you?
-The Lone Ranger.
-Then l'm Tonto. l'm going too.
-No, listen to me. lt's dangerous.
-There's more than one in there.
-Then you need help.
All right, listen.
You can watch my back and stand
by me, but do what l say.
No matter what happens,
don't you panic, don't run. Got that?
Yeah. Got it.
Twenty bucks.
My mama needs the money.
Your buddy may have been
their first kill.
They might not know what they are yet.
Just don't let them bite
or scratch you, okay?
Pull!
-That's one down, two to go.
-Jesus Christ.
You know, these old Dracula movies,
l always thought, what if--?
Kid, put it in the bag.
Go to the light!
This is how you make a living?
-l guess you'd say that.
-The money good?
Not bad. lf you did it every day,
you'd go crazy.
My mama needs the money real bad.
-How old are you, kid?
-Eighteen.
-l don't hire guys that lie.
-l'm going on 16.
-Come see me in a few years.
-Come on--
Look, you did a great job.
Appreciate the help. Go on.
-Appreciate the help, yeah.
-Hey!
Brody, what if the bogeys are...
-...you know, linking up to me?
-Come on!
Yeah, but what if?
That'd mean it's all over,
wouldn't it?
You can sit anywhere, hon.
l'm looking for a Jesse Brooks.
-Hey! Hotshot.
-Yeah?
With you in a couple.
-Coffee?
-Yeah, please.
Big sigh. Lot of weight.
-Business or domestic?
-Business.
Temp or perm?
Temp or perm?
-Perm, l guess.
-Legal or illegal?
-To tell you the truth, l don't know.
-All right.
-Life or death? l'm Zoey, by the way.
-l'm Derek.
-l already told you. lt's perm.
-So you did.
Now, Derek...
...would that be actual death...
...or un-death?
Would you ex cuse me for a minute?
Oh, shit.
Cold as a corpse.
Damn. She's cute too.
Jesse!
-What are you gonna do, just shoot me?
-Got a reason l shouldn't?
-Why are you out in the daylight?
-You think l did all that.
Hey, l ran, just like you did.
Why in the f uck are you standing
here in broad daylight?
That requires an explanation.
Can we go somewhere else, preferably
with some shade and maybe a Coke?
-Here's your f ucking shade. Get in!
-Jesus Christ!
You are a real jerk.
Pointing guns at people?
Somebody could get hurt, you know.
-Here's your Coke.
-lt's hot!
-Talk to me, damn it. You got bit.
-Not how you think. lt was during sex.
-l thought he was just carried away.
-He bit you?
-Made blood come. Freaked me out.
-l don't believe a word.
Look, when l got bit,
l went directly to Mexico City.
Guy in an AlDS clinic ran a bunch
of tests. He couldn't identify it.
He slipped me an experimental drug
and it worked.
l take it daily.
The infection's in check.
-How long?
-lt's been almost a year.
l have symptoms.
l crave red meat.
l get cranky with too much sunshine.
-Sometimes l see stuff.
-What kind of stuff?
Flashes, like dreams,
only l'm awake...
...and it feels like they're real.
l saw you and some guy
with a razor.
Then l saw you yesterday in a church.
lt was no surprise at all when
you walked in that coffee shop.
-ls it always me?
-No.
The night before last
it was this monastery.
Priests all in robes.
My God.
They dragged them out here
and stacked them up like firewood.
-lt was an all-night feeding party.
-What about your f riend?
They destroyed us.
Look.
Look what they've done.
-She came with several others.
-She? Their master's a woman?
You know she's death,
yet you want to give in.
l was buying supplies.
l returned just before dawn...
...but ran out of gas on the road.
l saw people coming.
l sensed something was wrong,
so l hid.
Then she passed.
l was lucky.
She didn't bother with me
because she had what she came for.
The history of my church
holds some ugly secrets.
One secret is an ancient battle cross.
The Black Cross of Berzier.
Vampires believe it gives
the power to walk in daylight.
Reverse ex orcism.
Every sucker's dream.
There's no secrets.
To civilians it's like mumbo jumbo.
You know differently, don't you?
lt's adding up.
Father Adam brings the cross
here because it's safe.
lt was, until his new f riend comes.
She needed it.
She needed the blood of a slayer.
Now she's got both.
-What slayer?
-l've been recruiting hunters.
The vampire gets there just before me.
These were good hunters.
They put up a fight, until the coffee
shop with Jesse Brooks.
That's how it works, isn't it?
l expose you and hand her...
-...candidates for a party.
-You can't blame yourself.
-Somebody has to go after her.
-Let me show you something.
Adam knew there would be more hunting.
He worked on this in his spare time.
lt's all ready to go.
-You're a hunter?
-l've hunted.
-l know it's not the same--
-This is suicide.
The vampire didn't attack until
you left. ls she af raid of you?
At the restaurant,
she attacked when you left.
-She hesitates around you.
-lt's a bad theory.
-Think small.
-How small? You and me?
lf the girl goes off her drugs...
...she'll turn on us
in a second, guaranteed.
First off, l'm a woman, not a girl.
l don't intend on becoming a vampire.
l'm fighting my condition with drugs,
and l have an ample supply.
When a cure is found, l'll be normal.
So if you want my help, you can ask
nicely with a little f ucking respect.
Maybe she can shoot a crossbow.
Maybe you should ask her very nicely,
with a little f ucking respect.
l'll be back.
-What are you doing here?
-Following you.
-How?
-My dirt bike.
-So you don't think l run away.
-What the hell is this?
'' Permission for my son, Sancho,
to have a job on your hunt''?
Read the rest.
'' He got good grades.
School out in three week.
He not flunk nothing.'' Oh, man.
Come on.
Zoey, Father Rodrigo, meet Sancho,
the fearless vampire killer.
-There you have it. Team Bliss.
-Derek, listen--
You listen. l start a search,
and everyone l look for ends up dead.
Then suckers wipe this place out.
And we're supposed to go after them?
With what? A teenaged dropout
f rom junior high school?
A woman who could
turn on me at any moment?
A man of the cloth who's maybe hunted
once in his life?
And me, a son of a bitch
who'd rather be surfing.
This ain't gonna work.
Sometimes you need
less than you think.
You need less ammo, less courage.
A loaf of bread, a couple of fish.
When it's all said and done,
there's no other choice, huh?
-l got the package. What's in it?
-Goodies. A big advance...
...and papers turning you
into an archaeologist.
Why an archaeologist?
Mexican government doesn't recognize
vampire slayer as an occupation.
-What's wrong with them?
-By the way, I found you some help.
A guy named Ray from Memphis.
Black dude, tough as nails.
Due in tonight, bus out of Tucson.
You hear me okay?
Loud and clear.
-What are we looking for?
-A big, tall black guy.
We got a no-show.
Hold it. l got a sucker.
You're five seconds away
if l need you, so watch me.
Hey, man, you got a light?
Thought for sure you'd be a smoker.
Any chance you're f rom Memphis?
Lousy part of town
to get what you came for.
You a mind reader?
Like you know shit about me.
No offense. l know a rookie
when l see one.
-You're new at this, ain't you?
-You trying to sell something?
l just remember when the thirst
kicked in. Worse than drugs.
Worse than smoking.
We're on the same side!
Drive a guy crazy, all these civilians
running around. lt drove me crazy.
All that...
...warm blood.
Swear to God, you can smell it.
-Shit, yeah.
-They smile, they talk to you.
But after a while all you hear
is a pulse.
Just beating away.
And guess what, smart-ass?
l can hear yours.
Good shot.
Yeah. l had a feeling about that punk
all the way down here.
-So you're f rom Memphis.
-Ray Collins.
-Derek Bliss.
-Cool to meet you.
What stops a bogey that cold?
Smith & Wesson, 12-gauge.
The real secret's the shells.
Hand-turned teakwood.
Fill them up with lead.
Like a deer slug. Packs a wallop.
That hunk of wood goes right inside,
just stays right there.
Of course, you still gotta
do the usual, you know.
What's he doing?
Brody said you had a big job.
Bring along plenty of those slugs?
Oh, yeah.
What you guys doing?
ls this real, or what?
lt's about time we head out.
-Got plenty of bloodsuckers in Memphis?
-Plenty everywhere, far as l can tell.
-Boss, we need to make a pit stop!
-lt's Zoey! She's sick!
lt's her.
-What are you seeing?
-l see the--
The cook f rom the coffee shop.
There's a priest, with blood.
The ceremony.
And the cross.
The cook is dead...
...and so is the priest.
And the vampire, is she still alive?
-Outside, in the daylight?
-No.
Light still hurts.
What? That's good, isn't it?
-l thought the sun might finish her.
-At least the ritual failed.
-Something l need to know?
-lt's daylight now. You mind?
-Hey, if you're keeping a secret--
-The things that l keep to myself...
...will only help us.
Concentrate, Zoey.
Okay. Here.
l think they're here.
Serena.
There's an old sugar mill nearby,
built on top of some ruins.
Adam told me about it.
Perfect spot for a colony, he said.
-How often?
-Once a day, two pills.
Another at night if l can't sleep.
You got plenty?
-A couple months' worth.
-Then what?
Then Mexico City again.
lt was so strong.
Not like the other times.
lt was like she was stalking me.
Look, l gotta ask you...
-...did she bite you or something?
-She tried to.
At the coffee shop she tasted me.
But something made her stop.
Maybe it was the medicine.
-This is it?
-Unless someone wants to drive.
-No, let's stop.
-l'm hungry.
Let's keep it simple. l want everybody
back in here before dark.
Ex cuse me, but ain't no
way l'm sleeping in this.
-You get used to it.
-l was in the Navy.
Even on a ship you got more room
than that.
l get nervous in tight spaces.
l might wake up in the night
and shoot somebody.
You don't wanna face
a vampire at night.
All due respect, but you ain't
been working with Miss Piggy.
Granted, it may take one, two,
even three rounds.
When she speaks, even the coldest
of the cold have to listen.
No ex ceptions.
Believe me, little brother,
them slugs never lie.
All right, get your beauty rest.
But you gotta drive first shift.
You got it, boss.
Hey, honey, what's the matter?
What's the matter, honey?
Come on over here and talk to Ray.
Somebody do something to you?
l won't hurt you. Come on.
Sit down.
You sure are beautif ul.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down now, darling.
You sure are a hot little tamale.
Don't let your hands write no checks
your body don't wanna cash now.
Whoa, whoa. Slow down now.
Are you feeling okay?
Yeah. l'll be fine. l'm all right.
We'll make it tomorrow morning
if we drive through.
-Long way to go if Zoey's wrong.
-She's not wrong. Can't you feel it?
-l don't feel anything but uneasy.
-Hey, boss.
What do you say we gas up and
get cool drinks for everybody?
That's a new one on me.
l'd have passed here a hundred
times and l'd never know.
All right, Memphis. Deep as you can.
All right, that's one down.
They're not here to feed.
They're just amusing themselves.
But l do think something else
is going on here.
Scare tactics? Maybe she was
counting on us stopping here.
Zoey.
Where is she?
-Nothing. Blank slate.
-Son of a bitch!
We got a flat tire. l must've
rolled over a nail or something.
Say anything about this place?
Present day, not much.
Poor farming community.
Different story in the 1200s.
Boom town.
Toltec culture was great,
but brutal.
There. lt's there.
-She's in there. They all are.
-Let's go in.
No, not yet.
Let's go to the village
and see what we can find out.
Well, where's everybody?
They're watching.
The norteños have come
to kill the devils of the night.
l saw it in a dream.
ls it true?
We have come to try.
Today is Día de los Muertos.
Day of the Dead.
But your timing is very good. Carlo!
A beautif ul girl, hungry, homeless...
...was taken in by a family
outside of town.
The family became strange.
The light left their eyes.
They disappeared.
Soon, others did too.
lt was said they went to the ruins
and lived underground.
People saw them at night drinking
the blood of those not yet afflicted.
This was once a thriving place.
Now, people cower in beds
while the devils walk the streets.
Two days ago, our priest disappeared.
Last night the church was burned.
The police never came around
very much.
Now, they don't come around
at all.
l gotta find a doctor.
l am af raid the doctor disappeared.
Did he have an office?
ln here.
-Painkillers, antibiotics. Not much.
-We gotta find something.
lt works. l need a line out.
How long will it take
to ship her drugs here?
Three, four days, five.
A week, maybe more.
lf we leave now, we'd be there
in a day and a half.
Two days there, two back. A week.
They don't have a week.
They lose people every night.
There's a bus today to Mexico City.
l'll take it.
l could go with you.
Stay here. Do what you came to do.
The bus will be here soon.
Derek, a bus schedule in Mexico
is more like a suggestion.
You know?
Derek says crosses don't
work on vampires anymore.
Maybe the people with the crosses
don't believe anymore.
You should eat something.
-You hurt yourself.
-lt's fine. Got it changing the tire.
-Zoey?
-Sorry.
l need to go into the shade.
How did she--?
lt's the middle of the day!
-Zoey's medicine.
-How'd she get it?
-All that matters is, where they going?
-The nest.
The vampire wants the drug.
She won't harm Zoey.
-Till she tells where she got it.
-She won't!
-Face the fact: Zoey might be dead.
-Or worse.
l don't care! l'm gonna help her!
All right, kid.
Don't get your hopes up.
-Okay, let's go in.
-Padre?
There's one last little thing.
Zoey didn't lose her medicine.
She's too caref ul for that.
Somebody went in her
pocketbook and stole it.
l know it wasn't me.
That means it was one of you.
What do you say, Padre?
That massacre back at the monastery.
Something you forgot to tell me?
Maybe it's the unlikely suspect
trailing me.
Maybe the bogey's been trailing you.
Or maybe it was about the money.
What do you say?
She slip you a few thou extra?
Look here. l'm a real simple man.
l came down to kill suckers
and get paid.
Anybody looking to throw down on me
is looking to get killed.
What do you say, kid?
Did she get to you?
There's no disgrace.
She's very powerf ul.
lt could happen to anyone.
-Get it off your chest, kid. Admit it.
-Son of a bitch.
Tell me the truth. Admit it.
-Fuck you.
-Talk to me.
-Fuck you!
-Talk to me!
-How did you know?
-l had a dream.
-What if it was wrong?
-Better my mistake than yours.
l'm sorry, kid.
lt could've been anyone of us.
Guess l screwed up big time, boss.
Do what you have to.
l won't hold it against you.
She knows you're here.
ln fact, she set it up.
Set it up?
-She's the client?
-Yeah.
lt's a simple plan.
Find the cross...
...expose you and the rest of us.
She's a smart one.
Boss...
...you haven't lived till you
got head f rom a vampire.
The drug wears off quickly,
but it works.
There's a million places to hide.
Slow down. We don't know
how many we're up against.
Look out!
Okay, clear!
lt's so quiet.
Big mama's waiting to see
if we get tired out.
-Unless the drug wore off.
-l like that theory.
Hey!
-Help!
-Zoey?
-l'm out of cable.
-Stay and cover him. You come with me.
-We shouldn't separate.
-Lag behind. Keep us all in sight.
Derek!
Derek, talk to me!
lt's not a good idea
we get separated this way.
The remote is not working.
Sancho!
Stop!
l can give you what you're after.
Not some drug you have to take
every day, but the real thing.
The ritual.
Did you think just any priest
could perform it?
l know how it must be done.
And l'm also a hunter.
Two for the price of one.
-Padre, no.
-lt's best this way.
Why are you so good to me?
l have no regard for you, or myself,
only for my f riends.
Something you wouldn't understand.
But if helping you is the cost
of saving them...
...so be it.
Decide, vampire. l don't care.
l can dive into this pit and
leave you behind for good.
Stop.
You know a good deal when you see one.
Let him go. Just you and me.
No, no, no. Go. lt's okay.
lt's what l want.
There has to be another way.
By morning we're not gonna
recognize her.
The self-control it's taken her
to hold back this long....
l'm sorry.
-What is she doing?
-She said to get lost.
-You're playing with fire.
-Don't talk. Help.
Help how? What the hell is she saying?
-Take care of the donors.
-Donors?
That old truck of yours
still for sale?
lf you give the money to the boy.
l think the boy's become a man.
lt's too soon.
Show him his way home.
Please?
You're back.
Halfway back. About like
where l was when we first met.
l'll take that.
l want you to get back
to Mexico City.
No, Derek. You're down to it.
You need me.
lf Rodrigo's got a chance,
l'll infiltrate the ceremony.
-l'll get a shot off.
-She'd hear your heart.
What if l'm infected?
lt'd slow my heartbeat. l'd mix in.
-Don't even think about it.
-l need a f ront row seat.
Lupe.
You got another patient.
This time, we're going in reverse.
You can feel it, can't you?
lt's unbelievable.
Why do you think people
get hooked on drugs?
l didn't know it would be this good.
You want me to do this too?
No, my f riend.
lf this falls apart,
you're gonna have to kill us.
Me, señor?
lf we don't return, Lupe, vámonos.
Go far away f rom here.
Abuelo, we gotta go.
ln the name of the Father...
...the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Get that cable as far as you can.
Heed this...
...our earthly wish.
That these deeds we do
find favour with the most high.
And both angels and devils...
...here we now are met.
One last thing.
You're out of luck, vampire.
You assembled every element,
ex cept one.
You forgot to bring a priest.
You can kill me,
but it won't help you.
l'm a hired hand.
l work at the monastery fixing cars
and cutting grass. l'm an impostor.
l saw what you did to the brotherhood.
You destroyed all of them.
l picked up their clothing,
put it on...
...and l vowed l would find you.
lf that's the truth,
you've failed to hurt me.
lf it's a lie...
...you've failed to help yourself.
-Let's go.
-l'm going back. Go.
Be ready.
Come on. lt's okay. Come on.
Come, come.
Can you hear me?
l don't wanna hurt you.
l just wanna see you.
l just wanna talk to you.
Sancho!
Zoey!
Zoey, for God's sake!
lf anybody wants to make a run for it,
this is a good time.
All right.
Oh, and, Padre?
Anything else l need to know?
-l told you my secrets would help.
-That you did, brother.
Need a straight shot with this.
Can you get it on the roof?
l'll see what l can do.
Hey, vampire.
l know you can hear me,
because l can hear you.
l can smell you.
The only choice left...
...is how to die.
Slow and painf ul...
...or it can be quick and easy.
You decide.
lt's a trap!
Sancho, get your back
up against something solid.
Heads up.
She's coming after us.
-We gotta get out of this hole.
-Like this.
Separate. She can't be
two places.
-Don't count on it.
-Now!
Come on!
Zoey, please!
Derek!
Okay. Thank you.
-How much time you think we have?
-Try to get there as fast as you can.
You sure you won't come?
Yeah. l'm needed here.
So you got a plan, amigo?
Yeah, clean up around here.
Make a special skeleton,
you know, for his grave and all.
You get fix ed up.
Come back soon.
Maybe hunt with me some more.
You're such a pro.
l better find something else to do.
Head back home, okay?
l could've kept your secret, you know.
You wouldn't have taken me.
lt's hard to keep a secret
f rom a vampire.
-Where is it?
-What?
You know what. The cross.
You went back for it.
That's a secret l can't share
with you right now.
Maybe when we meet again.
-lf the medicine doesn't work--
-lf it doesn't work, you will change.
You will try to survive and
everything will be different.
l'll pray for good medicine.
Take care.
Yeah. Thanks for the ride.
Sunlight getting to you?
We could slow down, let it outrun us.
No, let's make it last
as long as we can.
