Margaret.
Margaret.
Margaret.
Yes?
You should get some sleep.
Dr. Matheson!
Thanks for coming.
You can't imagine how
pleased I am to see you.
This is Dr. Matheson, actually.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Please, forgive me.
These last few days have
been a bit difficult.
Don't worry, I should have worn a lab coat.
That's Dr. Buckley.
Nice to meet you.
The pleasure's
all mine, really.
You can't begin to imagine what's
been going on here, really.
We haven't slept
a wink in weeks...
isn't that right, Sarah?
She hasn't been coping very well.
None of us have.
Did I mention we haven't
slept a wink in days?
That's it.
Did you hear?
It's starting.
Did you hear him?
He is a bit angry today.
Who's angry?
Traci's been
a real help, you know?
She's, uh... she's
been such a help.
I bet.
Can we see the rest
of the house?
Sure. This way, please.
It's an old house,
but the price was great.
We only moved in a while ago.
We're still settling in.
Hi, I'm Tom.
Uh, I'm a physicist.
- If you want to keep doing...
- I'm a physicist, too.
What did you think I was?
A housewife?
- A hairdresser?
- No, I...
- Oh, I... I didn't mean...
- Forget it.
Actually, I am a hairdresser.
Oh.
Traci. Traci Northrop.
Tom, enough mingling.
We're going upstairs.
I know, she's been a real help.
Since when?
I don't know, a few days.
Three or four, isn't
that right, Sarah?
You took so long. We
didn't know where to turn.
We're not a public
service, Mr. Sidgwick.
We do what we can.
Sure. Uh, excuse me a moment.
The girls' room.
Susan.
How many times have
I told you not to play
on the floor till
the heating gets fixed.
We're still settling
in, you know?
We, uh... still have some
stuff to sort out.
But the price was great.
Stand up, sweetheart,
and say hello.
Say hi.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You said "the girls."
Julia is at her grandparents'.
She wasn't feeling so great,
so we thought we just as soon
send her back to Vermont
for a few days.
A few days.
She's much better now.
Everything's ready.
Sorry. I didn't
mean to butt in.
Whenever you want.
Too much light.
When I begin the session,
no matter what happens,
please don't break the circle.
It can be dangerous.
January twenty-second.
Eleven fifteen.
Session participants are, from
the north side: Mr. Sidgwick
and his wife,
Dr. Margaret Matheson
and Traci Northrop.
The session is recorded
by Dr. Thomas Buckley.
Temperature is dropping
slowly, one degree...
Correction, two degrees.
Spring scale pressure
remains constant.
I... I can hardly hear you.
Speak up, please.
I can hardly hear you.
I know.
I know, but you
have to speak louder.
Gently.
Please, we've come to help you.
It really hurts!
Stop it.
Tell it to stop!
Michael, don't break it.
It hurts. I can't...
I demand that you stop!
I'm telling you, I
demand that you stop!
Michael, don't
break the circle.
It hurts! I can't!
- Don't break the circle!
- I demand that you stop!
Mommy! Mommy!
I'm scared, Mommy!
Let's get out of here.
Let's go away from here.
Okay, darling.
Okay.
So do you miss Vermont?
- Where do you live?
- In Bakersfield.
Nice?
Uh-huh.
Your sister like it too?
Who had the idea
about the closet?
Was that you, or your sister?
Julia.
She show you how to bang it
against the wall like that?
It really scares my dad.
What about your mom?
Mom wants to leave, too.
Let's make a deal,
just between you and me.
Do we have to shake hands?
No, we don't have
to shake hands.
Here's the deal.
If you promise not
to do it again
I won't say
anything to your dad.
That's it.
I... I didn't do that
thing with the table.
No, I know that, Susan. I
didn't ask you about a table.
My sister's gonna be real sad.
Yeah.
She's gonna be real sad.
My car, you drive. That's fair.
- Why is that fair?
- It is.
Where are you going?
You still didn't get
to the bottom of this!
Don't worry about it,
Mr. Sidgwick.
If the banging starts
again, just call us.
And get rid of the hairdresser!
It's been an honor to fly
you here, Mr. Silver.
I hope you had
a pleasant flight.
Please, allow me to help you...
Would you
mind letting go of me?
Thank you.
If you press down
hard on the top of the table
and draw your hands
toward your body,
the outer two table lengths
are going to go up like
a schoolgirl's dress.
You can even stick
the edge of your shoe
under one of the table legs
and, by pressing down
firmly with your hands
and lifting your foot
at the same time,
you can make the whole
table come off the ground.
It just takes
a little bit of muscle
and a whole lot of practice.
So, with the right
partner in crime,
you can put on quite a show.
The setting is important.
Keep it dark,
always, under
any pretext whatsoever.
The spirits demand it,
you need to concentrate...
I know what you are thinking.
It's not scientific.
But you need darkness to develop
a photograph, don't you?
Miss Owen?
So are you saying that
all paranormal phenomena
are frauds
without any exception?
Actually, no, I'm not.
The majority simply have
a natural explanation
or are the result
of subjective interpretation.
But how do you
establish proper controls?
It's not difficult.
In a case like this one, without
any special preparation,
we would sit the medium
against the wall
and place two cards
behind his elbows.
Then if he moves his
arms to shift the table,
the cards will fall.
If the cards remain in place,
only the spirit
of a very friendly stagehand
is going to be
moving that table.
That's the principle.
Or if you prefer,
you can mark out
a security perimeter
for the hands
to ensure that
no pressure is applied
outside the center of gravity.
For instance,
for the round table,
it will only move if pressure
is exerted here... or here.
Have you ever
come across a single case
that couldn't be explained?
Like the existence of
an anomalous ability?
An anomalous ability?
Like what?
Like running a hundred
meters in under ten seconds?
Like composing a masterpiece
when you're stone deaf?
Your brain may be
the exception, Ben,
but most brains carry out
a dazzling array of complex
mental processes every second.
constant synaptic communication
geared to generating and regulating
our sensations and perceptions.
How we reason, how we think,
our emotions,
our mental images,
our attention span,
learning, memory.
Are these not merits enough
for the brain
without it having
"special powers" as well?
So you're
saying the existence of any kind
of paranormal power
is impossible?
What I'm saying, Miss Owen,
is that after 30 years of
investigating all kinds of phenomena
with the right
controls in place,
I have yet to witness
a single miracle.
- Excellent table lifting.
- Thank you.
I... I just
sat in on your class.
Dr. Shackleton.
Inspirational. Congratulations.
You know, I admire
your skepticism, Margaret,
but you can't deny reality just
because you can't explain it.
That's not exactly true.
I can't explain why your
department gets double our budget,
but I don't deny it's the case.
So let's talk, join forces.
We're making huge strides
forward in the SPRC.
A discerning vision like
yours could really help.
I don't do hocus
pocus, Shackleton.
I suggest you don't either.
You didn't even touch that.
How do you do that?
Isn't that incredible?
Well, it doesn't
always work, Mike.
I got lucky today,
that's all.
The fact is, we can all do it.
Well, frankly, I knew
that, uh, blind people
had a more developed
sense of smell,
but after what we've
seen here tonight...
You're right. You're right.
Simon Silver became
popular at the end of the Sixties
and his fame continued
to grow over the next decade.
In 1975, he suddenly
announced his retirement,
Many linked his exit
from the limelight
with the death of a veteran
journalist, Martin Weiner,
while attending
one of Silver's shows.
The post-mortem concluded
the heart attack was
but Silver was never able
to shake off the suspicion
He disappeared just as suddenly
as he had become a star,
which is why his
come-back announcement
more than 30 years after
his last public appearance...
Margaret, I was watching that.
Sorry, I, uh...
I thought maybe you wouldn't
hear me, 'cause you... didn't.
Is Dr. Matheson around?
Uh...
No, she's not.
Mm.
Can I leave the
assignment with you?
Yeah.
Just watch the coin, okay?
- Where'd it go?
- Lift your glass, please.
Where did you learn to do that?
You can't always
trust your eyes.
You did most of the magic
by looking in the wrong place.
Oh, now you're really
taking the fun out of it.
The simpler, the better.
That's the principle.
The only way to pull a
rabbit out of a hat
is by putting it there
in the first place.
Open it.
It's in your left hand.
Did you... Did you see that?
No, I got lucky.
The class is really
great, you know?
It makes you think.
So, right, um...
you been working
for Matheson long?
Or are you a psychologist too?
Or a magician?
Wha...?
Uh, no, I'm not a magician.
Um, actually, I'm a physicist.
- So why do you do this?
- Do what?
Investigate fake
paranormal stuff.
Don't you think
it's a bit weird?
- I just try to help Margaret...
- I mean, what for?
If someone claims to have
powers and actually don't,
who cares? Why bother?
Why bother?
If your mom was one
of those people
who went to see a psychic
because, um... her stomach
was bothering her
and the psychic
told her that it was nothing,
that it was just a...
a touch of gastritis.
But then later on...
you find out
it was stomach cancer
and it's too late to treat.
Do you think then you'd
say "Why bother?"
Did... did that happen to you?
Okay, watch this.
Ready?
Here we go.
Oh, God! Jesus Christ!
Oh my God,
how did you do that?
Doesn't that hurt?
No.
Well, a litt... a little.
Simon Silver,
perhaps the most celebrated
psychic of all time,
will visit us here
in just under three weeks.
Online bookings have
sky-rocketed in just six hours.
And as soon as the Columbus
Theatre box office opens,
there will be a mad
rush for tickets.
Margaret Matheson.
Hello?
Hello?
Are you okay, Stevie?
You want your music, Stevie?
You want us
to put on your music?
Sometimes it helps him
to listen to music.
Okay.
He thinks
this is really cool!
We do too, but we don't paint!
Only Stevie paints!
Isn't that right, Stevie?
You paint, don't you?
Kids, huh?
Automatic painting, my ass!
I was about to make him
eat those crayons.
You heard it, it was, it
was the interference.
It was because Stevie and Van Gogh,
they just... they don't talk.
If it would help him channel,
I'm sure the mother would be
happy to cut off his ear.
- Well, a 90 mile drive.
- Hm.
And not one lousy doodle.
Are you okay?
If it were just
me on my own, I...
I don't think I could continue.
I'm getting too old
for this shit.
Oh, come on.
Where did you spring from?
You know you could
have a brilliant career
at any university
in the world, right?
You know that.
- Mm. I like this.
- But why are you with me?
Hey, so, um...
Yeah, I was, uh...
You know, maybe
it would be good if
someone else joined the team.
Do you ever think about that?
She's a little young,
don't you think?
Who?
For what?
Right.
I think I'll look in on David.
If you could drop
me there, please.
Okay.
The reason people
believe in ghosts is
the same as the
reason they believe
in haunted houses
or tunnels of light.
Because it would mean that there
was something... after death.
I only wish there were.
But I'm not prepared
to let my... beliefs
be determined by my
desires or my... needs.
If David woke up now
and looked in the mirror,
he wouldn't even
know who the man was
staring back at him.
He wouldn't know who I was.
If I thought for one second
that there was something else,
I would shut off all this crap
and let my son go.
Margaret.
A contactee was visited
and raped on a daily basis
by an extraterrestrial.
Savagely possessed.
Every night.
So she goes to a hypnologist
and the visits stop.
So she goes back to the
hypnologist and
"Can't you just make him
come back once a week?"
You know, there are two
kinds of people out there
with a special gift:
The ones who really think
they have some kind of power
and the other guys...
who think
we can't figure them out.
They're both wrong.
Aren't
you a little young?
For what?
Right.
So what are we looking for?
Red lights.
Red lights?
Discordant notes,
things that shouldn't be there.
Like that guy over there.
Hot dogs, hamburgers!
Hey, what about over there?
Well spotted.
- I'm so so sorry.
- What, are you blind?
- It's totally my fault.
- Watch where you're going.
- No, I wasn't watching. I'm sorry.
- Give me that.
- I'm sorry.
- Go on, just get lost now, will you, buddy?
Apologies.
Hoo.
Ha.
Like candy from a baby.
Good. In we go.
Okay.
Ah. Dr. Matheson.
I take it you've been
told I like the box all to myself.
Yes, of course, doctor,
we know that,
but I was just thinking
we'd have a safe...
And I'm sure you understand
that this deployment
is not what I meant
when I said discreet.
I'm sorry,
Dr. Matheson.
I'll give the orders
to pull back.
Doctor, how come we're
so sure this guy's a fraud?
Ever heard
of Occam's razor?
Occam's razor?
When I hear the
drumming of hooves,
I don't think unicorns,
I think horses.
Hm.
My name
is Leonardo Palladino.
I can see things.
Just like you.
If not, I would be blind.
I am a mentalist.
I've got a mind, like you.
I'm a clairvoyant.
Because
I can see clearly.
He hasn't changed
a single word.
The only difference...
- You know Palladino from before?
- Hm.
Well, not exactly.
We've had, Leonardo Borga,
Giordano and... What was it?
Zarica.
Zarica. But Leonardo Palladino,
it's our first time.
And we're just thrilled.
And he can't see us?
Not with this light.
The  is polarized.
No one can see anything.
Unless of course they
have special powers.
I'll tell you
what I don't believe in.
Watch this.
I don't believe in angels
of light curing the good.
I don't believe in
extraterrestrial beings
coming down from the sky
to guide the human race
to an age of re-awakening.
That's new.
Is that the Zimmer?
Yeah, I fixed it.
It's all good.
You fixed it? You should
have sent it out.
We don't have any
money. It's fine.
Tom, we should
ask for the money.
I said I fixed it. It'll work.
... with the Cosmos.
I don't believe in the Devil.
I don't believe in gods.
I don't believe in God himself!
I only believe
in a primal, single...
Come on, Tom, let's go.
Yeah, just a sec.
I'm on it.
...an explosion of lucidity,
old like the world, which
burns deep within me
and explodes with savage
brutality...
- Tom.
- Yeah, just give me a sec.
- Tom.
- One second. I'm on it.
I only believe in me!
Tom!
I only believe in me!
Come on, Tom.
That's it. Got it.
Leo, can you hear me?
Leo, if you can't hear
me, you're in trouble.
My head...
My head.
I can feel it.
- Judi Cale.
- To your right.
Judi Cale.
She should be in the
They're using inhibitors.
They know what they're doing.
- Can't you do something?
- Yeah, I think so. Just a minute.
Judi Cale, stand up right
now, in the name of God!
Hallelujah! Leonardo
believes again.
Stand up right now.
Stand up right now,
in the name of God!
Lives with her
parents at 3154 Greenwich.
I can see a ring of white
fire protecting your home.
The girl's
got stomach cancer, Leo.
Don't be scared.
Everything all
right down there?
Everything's wonderful.
Thanks for asking.
- Is it always like this?
- No. We got lucky.
The signal scrambles
every 40 to 50 seconds.
I just gotta isolate
this frequency.
They're not
usually this careful.
I know what's
wrong with you, Judi.
Don't be scared.
Get out!
Leave Judi's stomach! She
doesn't need you anymore!
Get out of there!
Judi.
You're cured.
Shout it out.
I'm cured.
Shout it out, in
the name of God!
I'm cured!
Hallelujah!
I sot it!
Alright,
Leo, Richard Vargas.
I'm calling Richard Vargas,
in the name of God!
No, Leo,
correct your position.
I'm calling Richard Vargas,
in the name of God!
Don't be afraid on account
of your sins, Richard.
Stand up and accept
the light of salvation!
He really knows
his moves, doesn't he?
He had a good teacher.
He worked with Silver
for over a year.
Simon Silver, the blind guy?
Okay, so he's
here with his sister, Maria,
Richard, don't be afraid.
Dorina and Maria aren't afraid.
Listen to them.
They want you
to come to the light.
Watch out, Leo!
Don'!- don't get in line with the...
Sorry, my fault.
I think everything's all right.
Everything okay?
You gotta be shitting me.
I'm with you, Richard!
I'm sorry,
Look at me, Richard.
Look at me.
I repeat: 423 Wilbur.
You guys go position yourselves
in the central block now.
We're going with the woman on crutches.
Row... 32.
That was close.
Did you check
the auxiliary control?
No. No, Leo. Stop touching
his chest, please.
His arm is the problem.
You know, one of these days
somebody's gonna
work out he's Argentinean.
Then... then we'll
be in real shit.
Hey. You guys lose this?
A lot of cancer. Mm.
I'm here, I'm back. There's
no doubt about that.
You know what I'm
talking about, Simon.
Are you going back on stage?
Well, who knows, Nina.
I heard it's
a distinct possibility.
I know it's a delicate subject,
but your last show didn't
turn out so great.
According to some
people, you were...
That was a long time ago
and I said all I had to
say about it back then.
It was a just an unfortunate
thing that happened.
You gotta admit it was weird.
Your biggest
detractor attacks you
at your own show, and...
It was unpleasant for everyone.
The rumor at the time was that
Martin Weiner
was writing a book
to demonstrate that you
were, uh... well, a fake.
That's, that's
the kind of thing
that I mean
that doesn't stack up.
The same folks out there
who say I have no powers
also say I induced a
heart attack in Martin.
Your number one enemy?
You're safe with me, Nina.
You know what I think?
I think you're getting
everybody to talk about you
without even going
out there again.
Wouldn't that just
confirm my powers?
You bet it would!
You know, Silver? I've been
wanting to do this for 30 years.
You know what I've
brought with me?
Let me guess.
Is it something that I can...
bend?
Well, how did you know that?
Did you just read my mind?
No. The handle's been
sticking out of your pocket
for the last few minutes.
So you can...
You are just a big
kid, you know that?
All right, what
do you guys think?
Why does no one let
me watch TV in this place?
Because only housewives
watch that show.
Come on!
I have nothing
against housewives.
My mom happens to be one.
doesn't sit around all day doing
macramé and watching crap TV.
We should take
a shot at Silver.
Oh, come on. Forget about it.
There's nothing interesting
for us there.
This arrived this morning.
It hasn't been
digitally retouched.
It's a trampoline.
Are there no real
challenges left out there?
Silver's a real challenge.
Silver's already
been investigated.
Yeah, like 30 years ago. We
should investigate him now.
He doesn't interest me.
Forget him.
He interests me. Come on! He's
gonna be here in 10 days.
You are like a broken record.
I said no.
What is wrong with you?
Are you afraid of him?
So, if you can get that in...
into a chart for me... Margaret!
Margaret, I heard about Palladino.
Everyone's talking about it.
I wanted to say thank you. People
like them give us a bad name.
I doubt it.
Come on, Margaret,
give us a break.
It's serious work
we're doing up there.
We started with scores of 2.1.
You know, nothing to write
home about, I know,
but in the last couple of
weeks we scored 3.4, 4, 4.6...
And the chances the difference are down
to coincidence is  in 100, Margaret.
- Paul.
- Two in a hundred!
All right...
All right.
Tom, go ahead and start
class without me.
Take this, this and that.
And, um, show them the photograph.
They'll enjoy that.
I won't be long.
So what is it this time?
Psychic photography?
- Retrocognition, remote vision?
- Telepathy.
- Drawings, sealed envelopes, cards?
- Zener cards.
Double blind, triple
blind, simple blind?
Simple blind. I did it myself.
I take it from your enthusiasm
you just did a test.
That's right.
Were you facing your subject?
Sure.
What about them?
Uh, they were in the control
booth, monitoring the subject.
Who was monitoring you?
Me? Why would anyone want
to be monitoring me?
It's a joke.
So were you at the same
eye level as the subject?
Approximately, yes.
- Under a light, I guess.
- Yes.
The way we are now?
More or less, I guess.
- You have the cards with you?
- No, I-I don't have them here.
- Oh. Yeah, here.
- Okay.
Okay.
Shoot.
What do you mean, "shoot"?
Go ahead. Shoot.
- T-To you?
- Sure.
- Here?
- Why not?
Okay.
Square.
Square.
Square.
Star.
- Wave.
- How are you doing that?
- Methodological defects...
- No, w... w... they're not transparent, we make sure...
improper controls, the inadvertent
inclusion of relevant data
or, in this case,
all three at the same time.
Congratulations.
Next time, try taking
them off first.
So why'd you hold the
card up to the light?
So you wouldn't think
about your glasses.
So, these images were
made during the Cold War...
under conditions controlled
by the Soviet authorities,
so there was no
independent investigations.
Leningrad, 1970.
Here Katia Novikova carries out
one of her more
controversial experiments.
As you can see,
she concentrates intensely
on the heart of the frog,
at the beginning
making it beat faster,
then slower,
and then, stopping
it beating altogether.
Katia asserted that she had, she had
inherited her powers from her mother...
and that during her childhood,
she would see objects...
Only God is right
all the time, Dr. Matheson.
And yes, there are sensitives
who are impostors,
just like there are skeptics.
Uh, you know, even scientists
are wrong every day.
But you, the
professional skeptics,
you also seem to be
experts in rhetoric.
Don't... don't bite off
my finger, doctor.
Look where I'm pointing.
Scientists' mistakes are
usually random, Mr. Cohen.
Pseudo-scientists' mistakes
tend to be directional.
Dr. Matheson seems
to forget that she
set up her stall
on this over 30 years ago.
Most professionals are fully
aware of the dangers of fraud
and design their experiments with
every imaginable precaution.
We're believers, doctor,
not simply credulous.
Very smart people are
often the most credulous
and are taken in by all
kinds of phenomena.
They're easy victims of fraud
because they think logically,
and professional magicians
count on that.
Like your client, for instance.
He's certainly one of them.
You should've told me
she would be here.
Oh, you said you wouldn't
speak to my client.
Are you scared of me too?
The question is why does every
parapsychological phenomenon vanish
when there's a qualified
skeptic in the room?
Three to four Americans say they've had
some kind of metaphysic experience
and an even
higher percentage say...
He's gotta be in on it.
He's in on it.
Doctor, this is a question for you.
Don't you think...?
Margaret, just
get out of there.
And even my colleagues,
the experimental psychologists“.
They're just gonna box her in.
They're just boxing her in.
...about their approach
to strange occurrences.
This is just what I'm
saying, it's just rhetoric.
It's just pure rhetoric,
it's just talking the talk,
but to refute the role
that all crows are black you need
just one single white one. Actually...
I've never seen a
white crow, have you?
Look a bit harder.
Miss Hansen, I believe that
you're Simon Silver's agent,
are you not?
I guess that means you've
gotten to know him pretty well
over the years, is that true?
I'm privileged.
He's a constant inspiration.
Silver's comeback has turned
into an event.
His recent sell-out performances
in both Atlanta and Dallas
can only be described
as an unbelievable success.
Today he will be
performing in our city,
at the Columbus Theater, less than
Now, Miss Hansen, is "perform"...?
That's a funny word.
Do you think that's the right word
to describe what's going on here?
I would say "share."
Simon has never been ashamed of
sharing his extraordinary abilities.
I think that "perform"
is exactly the right word.
I beg to disagree.
Why allow for a rigorous study
when the mass spectacle
is there to be embraced
and there's money to be made?
A lot of money,
I would imagine.
The word "choice."
- Excuse me, Simon Silver.
- Taking advantage of people.
Was subjected to rigorous studies
by at least two different...
Oh, come on!
Universities of
unquestionable renown.
But I guess
you know this, doctor,
since you were on one
of those committees.
I never signed off
on the findings however.
- Are you okay?
- Sh... sh... sh.
The
experiments weren't done
under proper
controlled conditions
Yeah,
controlled conditions.
Those of us born different
feel real safe.
Complete inspection
of all body orifices,
Faraday cages where we are
locked away like animals,
And... and you're
surprised that Silver
refused to subject
himself to that.
No, I'm not at all surprised
that he refused to
follow the one protocol
that would effectively eliminate
any possibility of fraud.
All this sounds very convincing,
doctor, but in actual fact,
telepathic experiments...
No, no, no, no, do not
go on the defensive.
Margaret, do not go
on the defensive!
She's going on the defensive.
Can you see this?
This is what she does.
She goes on the defensive and
then the whole thing just...
... in light of
my considerable experience
investigating these phenomena,
Aw, don't give 'em an edge.
Of the existence
of paranormal powers...
She's gonna mention the bone.
Just wait, she's gonna
mention the bone.
Do not mention the bone.
I've spoken to some
of those supposed victims
whose eyes you
claim to have opened,
and, believe me, they don't
have very nice things
to say about you.
Telling people they've been
victimized by these crazy ideas
and then trying to get
the ideas away from them
it's like trying to take
a bone away from a dog.
They don't want to let go.
Maybe I don't
know my place but...
How did you know that?
Because I'm psychic.
Yes, she did,
that's exactly what we are to you.
We were animals.
What I'm saying is give me
proof that a photon of light
can pass through a human body
and I will start to
believe in invisibility.
Until that happens,
all we're talking about here
is simple subjective beliefs.
What do you
believe in, Dr. Matheson?
Do you have a transcendent
view of life?
A what?
Well, you talk about beliefs.
What do you believe in?
Well, I don't really see what
that has to do with anything.
Well, it's a very
simple question
that maybe you can answer.
I'm just asking you,
do you believe or don't you?
Well, I try to
understand, not believe.
So you accept that it's possible
there's something out there?
No, I didn't say that.
You're  religious person?
No. You know, once, long
ago, I suppose I was.
Long ago?
And you lost your faith.
What... what happened, what...
What happened to
turn you into this...
lost, lonely woman?
- It's just a simple question.
- We're done.
Oh, so just
get up and walk away?
Sometimes things get
said, Dr. Matheson,
and it's not always
pure hyperbole...
It's always
the same with girls.
I'm terribly
sorry about this.
We expected her to
follow through...
...and I hope
she'll come back.
Meantime, thank
you to the panelists.
This is one
of the kinder ones.
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Tom.
Do you have any idea the
advantage he has over us now?
In one minute we've
gone back decades!
We gotta investigate Silver!
We gotta do it now!
Tom, I can see you're angry...
You've been keeping me
away from him for weeks.
I'm not stupid, Margaret,
so stop pretending I am.
I know you're not.
He is not worth your...
Enough!
We gotta investigate him,
and if you won't,
I'll do it on my own.
Look, I know they did
a job on you, okay?
I know it wasn't fair and
that stooge of Silver's
played dirty. But she did it.
They took you by
surprise, I understand.
I don't know what I would
have done in your place
but here's where we are:
We look like idiots.
It's been over two years
since we received
a lousy private dollar
and the department funding
is so ridiculously low,
the only way they can make it
clearer they want rid of us
is with a marching band.
It has nothing to do
with the university,
it's Silver.
But Silver wasn't even there!
Silver is always there.
Don't you get it?
No, we gotta
investigate Silver!
And we gotta do it now!
Tom, sit down.
Just sit down.
Please?
This is how he does it.
He did it to me, and now
he's doing it to you.
- What does that even mean?
- It's not the first time.
He knows what he's doing.
We're weak, Tom. We want to
be strong but we're not.
You're not angry with me.
Every time I close my eyes,
I see my son that day.
I see David playing
over there on the floor.
He was so small. He was sturdy.
And then he fell.
He just fell over.
I thought he was
playing, but he wasn't.
He was four years old.
- Margaret, I'm really...
- Shh.
Everything's all right.
I write to him, you know?
Because I know
he can't hear me.
"Dear David..."
Silver and I
were on a television show just
like the one yesterday...
and he was shouting.
I was shouting.
We were young.
And then he started staring.
Not at me.
He was staring at
something beside me,
as if he could see
someone beside me,
you know, the
way the mediums do
when they say they
can see an angel or...
or a dead relative next to you.
No. I wasn't surprised.
I was expecting theatrics,
so I was prepared.
"I see a boy by your side.
"I see a blond boy.
"Do you know who that
might be, Margaret?"
"Has a boy close to you died?"
I didn't answer.
I couldn't speak.
I was so frightened.
And he kept going.
"This boy is asking
you to let him go.
"He says you
have to let him go."
"It's his time and you
won't let him go."
Now, did I denounce him
an unscrupulous fraud?
Did I tell him that my
son was still alive?
Did I say anything in front
of those millions of people
who were waiting for my answer?
No. I didn't say a thing.
And you know the one
thing I can't forgive?
And I hate myself
for feeling this.
I hate myself from the moment
I wake up in the morning
to when I close
my eyes at night.
What I can't forgive is not
that he dared to use my son,
my sleeping, sick son.
What I can't forgive
is that for one second,
and it only lasted a second,
I thought it might be true.
He made me doubt!
And everyone could see it.
He's dangerous, Tom.
Stay away from him.
What can
you really know?
What can you really trust?
What are your doubts?
What are your certainties?
What do you call truth?
When you look at the sky,
what do you see?
Shadows? Reflections?
Distant echoes?
You see the moon as it was
more than a second ago.
You see the sun as it was
shining eight minutes ago.
But what do you really see?
Can you trust your eyes?
Can you trust... me?
We can go forward
with lies but...
we can never go back.
You are cured.
Go in peace.
I never felt proud
of being what I am.
I didn't choose it.
I didn't ask for anything.
Why was I chosen?
Who singled me out?
You're asking
yourselves the same questions.
Right now.
At this very instant.
I can hear you.
James Liddenbrock.
James Herbert Liddenbrock.
Stand up!
Margaret?
Margaret!
Margaret.
It's okay.
It's okay. Come on.
Help!
Please!
Help!
What are you doing, Margaret?
Fuck!
It's okay.
All right.
You gotta wait here.
As soon as we know anything,
I'll come find you.
- Does she have any relatives?
- Uh, well, a son, but...
- Can you let him know?
- Uh...
As soon as we know anything,
I'll come find you.
Hey.
Uh, they told me you were here.
How's the doctor?
Is she all right?
I don't... uh, I don't know.
They haven't told me anything.
What happened to you?
You're hurt.
I wasn't with her.
I wasn't with her.
I was at the theater
with Silver.
She told me not to go.
I said horrible things.
What's the point in keeping him
here like that after all this time?
Every science has its
corresponding pseudoscience.
Psychology has its flip
side, parapsychology.
Medicine has acupuncture
and homeopathy.
Astronomy has astrology.
I've had personalized birth
charts made for each of you
based on your
individual dates of birth.
If you could open
the envelope, please,
and study them carefully.
Hello?
Hello? This is Tom Buckley.
Hello?
This is Tom Buckley.
Silver?
Okay, now you've
all had a chance to
study your charts
so we're going to grade
them from one through five,
one being a low level
of coincidence
five, being a maximum
of correlation.
How many ones?
Good.
Two?
Threes?
Good.
Four?
Good.
And five?
Good.
Okay. If you can
pass your chart
to the person behind you.
And if you guys in the back...
What?
They're all the same.
Er...
We're just going to leave
it at that for today, so...
We'll pick it up tomorrow.
Thank you for coming.
Fuck!
This isn't my
first time inside, know that?
Leonardo.
Yes, Buckley, Leonardo.
Good memory.
You're butting in already!
At 5:00 a.m. they give you
a little carton of milk.
I don't eat breakfast.
I wait until lunch at eleven.
Elbow macaroni with hot
pepper, rice, frijoles...
Hardly ever meat.
Sometimes you get
a spicy hamburger.
They think we're all Mexicans.
At five, you get
the same thing again.
And that's it
until the next day.
So at night I take out
my carton of milk.
Leonardo..
I've lost 15 pounds
in less than 4 weeks.
- Leonardo!
- Yes?
You told Silver we'd be there,
didn't you?
You told him how
we shut you down.
Did the blind guy
spook us then, Buckley?
Did the blind guy see us
when we were up to no good?
When'd you talk to Silver?
Buckley, you've come
to the wrong place.
Silver doesn't need me to know
whatever he wants
to know, get it?
This isn't one of your shows.
I'm the guy
who put you in here.
Now tell me when
you spoke to Silver!
I hardly know Silver, you
fucking shit for brains!
You worked with him
for over a year!
nobody tell you that?
I'm 37, Buckley.
I was just a fucking
kid back then.
He used me!
I just had to cry and shut
up whenever he told me.
Do you think he spilled his
fucking heart out to me?
I'm wasting my time here.
You've got no idea what
you're getting yourself into.
Good seeing you
again, Leonardo.
You've got no idea what
you're getting yourself into!
Whoa, did you know...
Silver canceled his
last performances in Denver
I guess
he's afraid of flying...
I hope the theater
had insurance.
I mean, last show in
town almost spelled
the end of
the Columbus Theater.
Forget it. My nephew bends
spoons all the time
and all he's gotten
for his troubles
is to make my sister
hide the spoons.
If my nephew was blind,
my sister wouldn't need
to hide the spoons.
- You bet.
- Ow.
What do you say we open the phone
lines so some people can call?
Anybody blind out there
who wants to sue us?
You'll leave us
with no aim in life!
Fuck!
What?
Okay, okay, okay...
Come on!
Come on!
Come on.
Oh, fuck!
I'm sor...
I'm sorry.
J" In the summertime,
When the weather is hot J".
J' You can touch right up
And touch the... JV'
Ah, fuck!
Fuck.
Okay.
Do you have
an appointment, sir?
Can I help you?
I was...
I was just looking
for the way out.
Excuse me.
Right.
Tom.
Tom.
Open your eyes.
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Aw!
Fuck!
Wait, are you okay?
What happened?
'...
Shh!
Tom... Tom...
Shh!
Tom...
Tom.
Shh. It's okay.
- Will you tell me what's going on?
- It's okay. It's okay!
Silver?
Silver!
Silver!
Tom, what's going on?
Come on.
Don't leave me here.
Don't leave me here!
Silver!
Silver!
You left me on my own.
I told you not
to leave me on my own.
You need to leave here.
What's going on?
Jesus, Tom, you're bleeding.
You need to get
that cleaned up.
What's going on?
University sources
confirm that Simon Silver
head of the Scientific
Paranormal Research Center
to be submitted to
an exhaustive scientific study
of his extrasensory abilities.
Isn't that right, Dick?
Yes, that's
the way it is, Dana.
who had been ca/led into
question in this university
will put himself through
all kinds of tests
designed by a committee
of experts from the SPRC.
University sources confirm that
Dr. Matheson had been suffering
from a rare and long-standing
vascular condition
of her unexpected illness
and sudden death.
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't understand
what you're talking...
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Why don't you step into my office?
I want to be on that
committee, Shackleton.
Whatever it takes,
I don't care what,
I wanna be there.
It's impossible. The team
has already been presented.
There's nothing I can do.
Don't give me your excuses,
Shackleton. Just do it.
The committee was
approved by Silver!
You know what that means?
It's a once
in a lifetime opportunity!
Whatever it takes, Shackleton!
No more whining.
No more moaning.
Ask for more observers. Make
up whatever story you want.
Get that over-subsidized
brain of yours working.
I wanna be there.
I'll be waiting for your call.
Don't leave me here.
Let me at least
try and help you.
I'm going to be fine.
It's just
for a little while, okay?
Look at you, Tom.
Margaret was right. Can't you see it?
Just let it go.
- I need to know how he does it.
- What difference does it make how he does it?
Forget about Silver, Tom.
There are certain things
it's better not to know.
Sally, I just need to know.
Meters have been installed
to detect the exertion
of any physical force
or the use of irregular
chemical compounds
known to alter the
resistance level of metals.
Each piece has
been specially marked
to prevent the possibility
of any swap during the tests.
Thermoelectric heat meters,
radiation monitors,
everything in the Scientific
Paranormal Research Center /ab
is in place
to fest Simon Silver,
who this morning
may have just canceled
a number of his
public appearances.
This just isn't fair.
We've been waiting
in line for two days.
Eating and sleeping here.
Who's standing up
for our rights?
It wasn't
just a show, for me.
For me it was more
important. And now...
I don't care.
Hell, I really don't.
If he thinks it's cool,
I think it's cool.
I just hope he shows those
smart-ass college know-it-alls.
Shit, what the hell are all
these people doing here anyway?
Like, they put on the TV for 15
minutes and obey like sheep.
What's this guy done
that's so incredible?
Like, has nobody
heard of Criss Angel?
It's a matter
of absolute priority
that science begins to learn
all it can about these forces.
We can't wait any longer.
The aim of my public
appearances
is just to generate
the necessary conditions
so that our blind
society will open
its eyes to the existence
of other forms of energy.
These forces can't
be ignored any longer.
They have to be verified and accepted
once and for all. Thank you.
Is it true that you
canceled some of your shows?
Nothing's been canceled.
We're just re-scheduling.
Mr. Silver. One more question.
More than 100 journalists
have requested accreditation
more like the numbers we
expect at a political summit
However, only a handful
of media outlets
have been granted passes
to the inside of the building
and none are allowed
to remain there
while the tests
are taking place.
We're trying to guarantee control conditions.
We're scientists,
and for the first time we could
just obtain conclusive results
about the reality
of extrasensory perception,
the power of the
mind over matter.
Our priority has to be to ensure
the veracity of those results.
Today's a great day,
ladies and gentlemen.
We could just be about
to go beyond...
beyond a point of no return.
And... cut!
Great, we got it.
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.
Thank you for coming.
From now on, no cameras
except the university's
will be allowed in the lab. Thank
you again for your cooperation.
Remember, Buckley,
you don't form
a part of this committee.
You're just an observer.
You'll make no contribution
to the design of the tests
or the control protocols.
You can look, you can listen and
you can shut your goddamn mouth.
Don't think I'm scared of you.
If I'm putting up with you, it's
out of respect for Margaret.
You try to honor her
in the same way.
Mr. Silver!
Mr. Silver, allow me to say
thank you for
agreeing to do this.
And let me apologize in advance
for any inconvenience
we might cause.
Science will be
very grateful to you.
Well, that is
my sole objective.
It's me who should
be grateful to you.
Oh, you already
know Dr. Haynes.
Doctor.
Dr. Campbell.
- Doctor.
- Hello, sir.
Dr. Conrad Jennings, professor
of Biomedical Engineering,
University of Leeds,
- has been kind enough to join us.
- Doctor.
And Professor Franklin,
Professor of Physics,
Case Western University
of Ohio.
Doctor.
Now, if you don't mind...
There's another guest
here, isn't that right?
Yes, that... that is right.
Excuse me, I... I didn't
introduce you formally.
Have you met before?
I don't know. Have we?
Dr. Buckley, of the University's
Psychology Department.
He worked very
closely with Doctor...
I have a great interest in the
figure of Doctor Buckley.
I follow his
progress very closely.
It's been a difficult
time for all of us, Tom.
How are you getting along?
I was so sorry to hear
about Dr. Matheson.
Of course, uh...
we can begin whenever
you feel ready.
If you'd like to come this way.
We know this isn't
an exact science.
Take your
time, whatever you need.
We'll start with something
straightforward,
you know, like an icebreaker.
Oh, oh, sure.
Psy... Psychic photography?
Thoughtography.
How... How did you know?
Oh, it's been a long
time since I did this,
a very long time indeed.
Digital, isn't it?
Yeah, it is.
Exactly. Do you need...?
I just need  simple
piece of cardboard.
I don't want my fingers
smudging the lens.
We opted to prepare
a plastic cylinder.
I hope you don't mind. It's
a half inch in diameter.
Is it okay, will it do?
One never knows,
Dr. Shackleton.
As you just said yourself,
this isn't an exact science.
Do you mind?
Go ahead.
Please, be careful
with my watch.
The  top flips up.
I don't want the hands
moved by mistake.
From now on you'll
not be allowed
to withdraw your hands
from the table,
unless it is for the purpose
of another inspection.
You understand that, don't you?
Yes.
If you do so,
the test will
be declared invalid.
Okay, thank you.
Ready when you are.
This film
shows the first six days
in the Scientific Paranormal
Research Center
All the images correspond to the
filming of real experiments.
Silver received three different
models of still camera:
with a fixed /ens
focused on infinity,
a conventional
analogical camera
with a 50 mm /ens
focused on infinity
and an instant Polaroid camera,
also focused on infinity.
Silver's attempts
with the digital camera
did not produce
any positive result.
The second camera registered
only partial results,
insufficient for
a positive evaluation.
Only the Polaroid camera allowed
the apparent projection
of Silver's thoughts
onto the photographic plate.
There is no scientific
explanation for these results.
The cylinder or gizmo which
Silver was provided with
in order to concentrate
the flow of his thoughts
was carefully checked before
and after each experiment
in order to rule out
any possible manipulation.
Silver claims to be capable of
bending metal at a distance
However, during the
course of these tests,
this could not be
experimentally confirmed.
Following a more
re/axed protocol,
Silver was allowed
to touch the metal
which, as can be seen
in the film, was indeed bent.
Visual analysis of the film
is insufficient to determine
whether Silver possesses
extremely strong fingers
and great control of
micro-manipulation movements
or whether the distortion
is in fact caused
by a paranormal ability,
as he claims.
Later, Simon Silver
held his hand out
in the continuous flow
of a running tap.
As the images show, the flow
of water was notably deviated
by some kind of external
stimulus around Silver's hand.
The difficulty in measuring
this distortion
has been excluded from
any experimental evaluation.
I think I've
got it, Doctor.
I was trying with
the second adapter
but if I could just join...
Concentrate, Ben.
I appreciate your help.
No more mistakes, okay?
I'm sorry, Doctor, I promise...
Don't promise anything.
Just plug it in. Good.
What, black and white?
It's fine. It doesn't matter.
Okay.
Keep going, keep going, keep going...
Stop! Stop there.
Okay, this was the last test.
Telepathy booths.
During the whole two weeks,
I wasn't able to get
within six feet of Silver,
but you and I both know
the whole thing is a farce.
- Actually, Dr. Buckley, I...
- A total fucking farce. Okay, rewind.
Keep going, keep going.
Okay, go over to the
other side of the gym.
Stop, Ben! Stop there! Stop!
You know, right now, Shackleton
is analyzing the data,
getting ready to publish
his positive findings tonight,
which just happens to coincide
with Silver's last show,
which by some
strange coincidence,
just happens to be taking place
in this very city.
It's the finale he's
been after all along.
Well, why all this pressure?
If we find out
something afterwards,
they'll have to change
the findings.
Ben, nothing that happens
afterwards will matter.
Listen to me.
You are the only guy
separating the world from stupidity
at this point in time. Okay?
Okay? Now, you see this button?
I've spent two days loading all
the images from all the cameras
then synching them
frame by frame,
with all the
angles in here, okay?
Okay? Okay, Ben?
This is the reception booth.
Silver is the receiver.
That's the instrument panel.
It's got ten luminous buttons.
Normally they put
a playing card in each one,
but given that Silver is blind
they've just numbered
them one through ten.
Okay, and what's
supposed to...?
Quiet. Now, second booth.
It doesn't matter.
It's just a dead bird.
This is the
transmission booth.
Now, you see the monitor?
It's a closed circuit.
Is he seeing
his own panel?
No. No, no, no.
He's seeing Silver's panel.
It's supposed
to help him concentrate.
So the computer randomly
turns on alight.
Then the guy concentrates
on the number he's
been given. Okay?
When he thinks
he knows the number,
he presses the red button,
which sets off a signal
in Silver's booth.
When Silver hears the signal,
he clears his mind, he
concentrates, whatever the fuck,
when he thinks
he knows the answer,
he presses
the corresponding number
he think the guy has sent.
Is that clear?
Okay. The experiment lasted
a total of seven
hours, including breaks.
It was repeated a total of
nine times, in blocks of ten.
The results were spectacular,
with a deviation rate
eight times higher than
can be explained by chance.
Now, what does this mean?
That Silver's powers...?
No! It means that Silver
is pulling a fast one!
Do you know how I know this?
Because telepathy does not exist!
Because nobody
has special powers!
No. The protocol,
in theory, is sound.
It's just that Silver has
found a way of breaching it.
Okay, don't look
for radio transmitters,
because the booths work as Faraday chambers.
I've checked them.
They're isolated.
What if he's not
pulling a fast one?
Ben, you've got 41/2 hours
of footage there
from seven cameras.
- That's 30 hours.
- What am I looking for?
An explanation, Ben,
just an explanation.
Try to make it rational.
Hey.
Is everything okay, sweetie?
It's raining.
Sit down, please.
I'll be with you
in just a minute.
I'm not a very
accessible person.
I suppose you've
realized that by now.
Only somebody who really wants
to get to me can do so.
I won't talk to
anybody else today.
Maybe I'll do so tomorrow,
in some other city.
Maybe I won't ever again.
As for me, I live each day
as if it were my last.
And I'm starting to feel tired.
Very tired indeed.
I don't always demand payment for
my services, did you know that?
At least, not in money. There's
other ways of paying for things.
But you know that already.
You do know that, don't you?
To be or to appear to be,
that is the question.
It always is.
We all try to be
something we're not.
We dream 27 times a night.
An intricate neurological
protection mechanism
which makes us forget.
What protects you?
Aline of salt?
From the time of ancient
Greece to the present day,
philosophers and scholars
have argued
man is essentially rational.
I don't happen to agree.
If one observes and
studies another person
without having first
studied oneself,
how do we know whether our
instruments are appropriately set?
How do we know we are reliable?
We have no proof.
There's only one way
of gaining access to the truth,
and that's not
to expect anything.
If our intentions aren't pure,
we might end up
creating monsters.
Hm. Please excuse me.
It's getting late.
For you too.
Don't worry, we'll see
each other again.
Oh, yes. We'll see
each other again.
Silver is in the
final stages of his countdown,
only 12 hours after the announcement
of his most recent retirement.
This unexpected news
has caused commotion...
...all kinds of
contradictory reactions.
Those that predicted that
Silver had come back to stay
have had no option
but to accept...
...estimate that Silver
may well have pocketed
more than four million dollars
in less than a month,
a figure that would confirm...
most immediate consequences,
with prices of up
to 2,000 dollars
being asked by
scalpers for seats,
a more than dubious record
being held today...
...packed out an hour and
a half before the start
of what will be
his last appearance.
It is impossible to predict
an outcome for this...
...and it's with
great expectation
the verdict from the Scientific
Paranormal Research Center,
to be announced
officially tonight.
If the leaks get out...
...maybe thereby silencing
more than one skeptical voice,
and transcending
once and for all
the area of mystification
and the study
of frontier sciences.
Science has rarely had the
chance to study at close hand
such controversial
manifestations
as those which have made
Simon Silver famous.
We really have to wonder if the
spectators presently witnessing
the final chance to see Simon
Silver will get what' they paid...
Why have you come here tonight?
What are you hoping to see?
Do you think I
should surprise you?
Do you think I
should entertain you?
What are you
looking at so closely?
What do you know about me?
How much do you believe?
How much do
you want to believe?
I can feel your longings,
your desires...
I can feel your demands.
It is a deep, painful
urgency of the animal
forced to live in darkness
which finally opens his eyes
and voraciously demands light
with a howl of rage!
What is it you've come to see?
This?
Have you come to see this?
I feel my veins burning
with the fire
of a new understanding!
We called Ptolemy insane,
we spat in the face of Galileo,
we burned Giordano Bruno...
What did we need?
What do we need
in order to learn?
What makes us be what we are?
What finally makes
us come to accept?
What makes us believe?
The question is:
Why did you come here...
today?
Are you crazy? I shouldn't
even be talking to you.
Wait, wait, Ben,
I'm not against you.
I... I just need to
know what you've got.
You're my student
too, remember?
Dr. Shackleton,
you know I can't talk.
Listen, Ben,
I've always respected.
Dr. Buckley's work,
and Dr. Matheson's.
I'm not the enemy.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I'm going to hang up.
Ben, I've got the results
of nine days of experiments
sitting right
here in front of me.
Definitive results.
The only thing missing
is my signature.
I'm talking about the scientific
verification of extrasensory perception
and forces which until today have
only been seen as para-science...
I can imagine.
Do you have any idea what the
publication of these results
will mean to Dr. Buckley
and his department?
Yeah, I... I guess.
Ben, if we've got
anything wrong, anything,
I need to know.
What have you got?
Nothing.
What?
- What do you mean?
- We got...
nothing.
Final call,
we'd better get going.
I hope the second half
is better than the first.
I didn't spend 300
bucks to see Hamlet.
- Sally!
- Ben? What are you doing here?
Shit, Sally, you don't know
how pleased I am to see you.
Tom told me you'd be here.
You should be
doing this, not me.
What are you doing here?
Where is Tom? He's not home
and he's not answering his phone.
Did something happen to him?
Is that SPCR?
Telepathy booths. I've been
watching the same images.
- If you want my opinion...
- Ben, I don't. Where is Tom?
With Silver, I think.
- What do you mean with Silver?
- At the theater.
It's nothing out
of the ordinary.
He wants you to wait for him
here, so take a seat.
He's perfectly all right.
What's that?
- What's what?
- That. There.
His watch?
Why would
Silver wear a watch?
Blind people wear watches too.
They tell the time
by touching the hands.
They checked it. It's clean.
Can you split the image in two?
- What are you looking for?
- I don't know yet.
Put the sender on the left
and Silver on the right.
That's it.
Move in on the watches.
- Can you do that?
- On the watches? Sure. Give me a sec.
I can't get an angle.
Let me try with another camera.
Can you
improve the quality?
Mm-hm. Sure. I can
amplify a single pixel,
click it up with my magic
and make it so bright and shiny
you need sunglasses
to look at it.
This ain't a movie.
We're in
the psychology department.
All right.
Go to the other camera.
I'd like to know
what the hell is...
There! Stop!
Shit, Sally. It's a
recording, you know?
We can go back and forth
as much as we want.
We can chill out.
- Are you sure they're synchronized?
- Yes.
- Completely?
- Completely.
What are you looking for? They
don't have the same time.
What are the chances
that Silver and the sender
are both wearing
analogical watches
and that both are
synchronized second by second
in millimetric precision?
Synchronized? Didn't you
hear what I just said?
The watches don't tell
the same time.
Second by second.
Shit. It's a code.
They divide.
They just have to divide the dial
of the watch into ten sections,
one for each number.
When the second hand reaches
the corresponding section...
...the sender presses
the button.
Silver just has to know
where the second hand is
when he hears the signal
and translate it
to the position.
They're in it together.
Dr. Buckley was right.
It's a fraud.
Silver never touched the hands.
The simpler, the better.
Okay, it's right here
in front of us.
What was it Matheson
used to say?
Results appear when there
is defective methodology,
important data is
inadvertently included...
...or improper controls
are in place.
They've taken
something for granted.
Oh, Shit.
Silver can see.
Simon Silver!
Simon Silver.
Did you really
need to go this far?
You will
know the truth,
but the truth will
make you furious.
Ladies and gentlemen, and
I don't think I'm wrong
when I say
we have a distinguished
guest amongst us.
It's okay.
The young and persistent
Thomas Buckley,
many of you may know,
decided some time ago
to devote part of his life
to making mine
as difficult as possible.
Am I going too far
if I say he seems
somewhat out of sorts?
I wasn't able.
In the end I just wasn't able.
But you know that, don't you?
You can't deny yourself.
You can't live
in denial forever!
I tried with all my strength.
Today it will be over.
For you and for me.
- I just hope we're both ready.
- You're a fool, Buckley.
Are you threatening me
in front of everyone?
I'm not like you. You can't hurt me.
I am the life force!
I come with the wind
and I go with the wind.
Do you want me to hurt you?
Get out of here
now while you can.
I don't want to
interrupt anything
but I'd really
like to sit down.
My arm is hurting.
Then put it down. There's
nothing stopping you.
I just... just I...
I simply can't.
Don't believe everything
they tell you.
You'd be better
off sitting down.
Buckley, how dare you?
Are you challenging me? Are
you questioning my power?
We fill our
heads with noise.
Stay where you are. Do
you want me to hurt you?
We renounce ever
knowing ourselves.
But you can't deny
yourself forever.
Isn't that right?
Buckley!
Don't you dare ignore me!
Time goes on.
And you think you have
all the time in the world,
that nothing is final...
But time goes on.
Stay where you are.
Don't take another step.
You're playing with fire,
I'm telling you.
You're playing with fire!
But in the end, so much
time has gone by...
And you know you should
have done something,
and then you wake up.
Don't you know the kind of
force you're up against?
It's already over.
- Stay where you are!
- Margaret never knew.
I don't think you don't know
what you're up against.
I never told her.
She never knew.
Don't come any closer.
And now everything is a lie!
Don't come any closer!
I'm warning you!
Did you know all along, Simon Silver?
Did you know?
Buckley! Buckley!
That's all I want to know.
Did you know all along?
Buckley!
Buckley!
Buckley!
How did you do that?
Phoney.
How did you do that?
Simon, come with me.
How did you do that?
How did you do that?
Even today I'm not exactly
sure when everything ended.
I wanted to cry,
to feel anger, grief}
searching in silence
for someone like me.
A whole life
looking for an answer,
I /earned so many things
from you.
But I forgot
the most essential thing.
How did you know that?
Because I'm psychic.
Silver?
It was me all along,
wasn't it, Margaret?
Where did
you spring from?
Why are you with me?
It was me...
all along.
You can't deny
yourself forever.
You did most of the magic
by looking in the wrong place.
I did what you'd have wanted.
But I'll never forgive myself
for not revealing myself,
for not at least giving
you the consolation
of knowing...
there is something else.
But you deserve more.
Today you deserve everything.
You can't deny yourself.
You can't deny
yourself forever.
