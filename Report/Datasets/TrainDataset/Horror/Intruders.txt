The shadow monster woke up.
It saw the boy
in the pot and said:
"Mmm. I'm starving."
"I'm going to eat you up."
So the monster opened
his mouth wide and...
swallowed
the little tailor whole.
The boy fell
and fell into a dark cave
filled with slime...
Is that it?
That's all
I could come up with.
Well, you'll think
of something tomorrow.
Let's go to bed.
But I'm not sleepy and I
haven't finished it yet.
I know, sweetie, but Mommy's
tired from working all day
and she needs to sleep.
Here, I'll carry you.
God, you're heavy!
Your story needs an ending.
Let's see if I can help.
Let me think...
Remember the scissors the
tailor had given his son?
Well, suddenly he remembered
he still had them.
He took them out
and started cutting.
Snip, snip, snip...
Snip, snip, snip...
And the monster shouted:
"Ouch!"
"Who's cutting me?"
And the little tailor...
I know, I know!
The boy cuts his way out,
makes himself
a monster-skin coat
and the arrows couldn't hurt him any more.
I'll finish it right now.
You're going to sleep or you'll
be tired in the morning.
Mom...
We'll get the little boy out of the
monster's belly in the morning.
Don't shut it, Meow is still outside.
He might want to come in.
No dreaming
about monsters, okay?
Come!
Come!
Leave her alone, monster!
Let him go!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy, Mommy!
There, there...
It's over, sweetie.
There, there...
The monster came in
through the window.
It wanted to take me away.
It was... It had no face.
There's no monster in here.
It was only a nightmare.
It was only a nightmare.
Don't worry.
It's over.
What if he comes back?
If he comes back, close your
eyes and count to five.
When you open them,
he'll be gone, you'll see.
FRANK: I'm going to call her.
She is driving me crazy.
I can't stop
thinking about her.
Oh, I'm sure Carol would
be very happy about that.
Fuck off.
You're not an angel.
Don't tell me
you never thought about it.
Listen, mate, I'm
very happy with what I've got.
I mean, what could be so wrong
with a bit of
no-questions-asked,
harmless fun with
a filthy stranger
to spice up your love life?
Just as long as Carol
doesn't find out.
And if she does?
I'd deny it, wouldn't you?
Listen, mate, if I were you,
I'd just get it out of the way
and tell her everything now.
Fuck off!
Come on!
Keep an eye on Frank.
I have to call my daughter.
SUSANNA:
She is just very lonely.
DAVE:
She must miss you.
Yes, she does. She misses me very
much, but my brother's there, so...
Send them my love.
I will. That's nice
of you, thank you.
Yeah, I know, she is old.
Hey, Dad.
Where are you?
JOHN:  Sorry, sweetheart.
I'm still at work.
That's too bad. Grandma
made me her famous cake.
chocolate, jam in the middle
and fake cream on top.
Is Mum there?
Can I talk to her?
Sure.
Dad wants to talk to you.
Hey, baby.
Yeah. Okay.
Mia, it's so good to see you.
MIA:
Where is Winnie going?
Yeah? Okay,
love you, too. Bye.
Hey, Winnie, where are you?
Winnie, where are you?
Where are you going?
What have you found?
MIA: "Hollowface woke up because
someone called his name."
"After many, many
years, he was free."
"He wasn't young or old,
or ugly or handsome."
"He had no shape, he
didn't even have a face."
"He remembered a boy with a
face that looked like him."
"Hollowface had
to find the boy."
"He had to
find his face."
"Until one night, Hollowface
finally found a face to steal."
"It was a little boy
staring out of a window."
"Hollowface wanted
the boy's face"
"more than anything
else in the world."
"he had nothing."
"So he devised a plan."
"First,"
"he'd separate the boy
from his parents."
"Then he'd take him
back to his lair."
"He'd rip off his face
and wear it himself."
"That way,
everybody would love him."
"The next night,"
"Hollowface
dressed up as a man"
"and went back
to the boy's house."
"He ran up
the wall quickly."
"He slipped
through an open window."
"He found the boy's room
and slipped inside."
"The boy was sleeping."
"Hollowface moved
closer and closer,"
"and closer."
Continue, Mia.
That's all I have.
You haven't finished it?
I didn't know how to.
It's not bad.
You've hooked your audience and
left us with a cliff-hanger.
Try to finish it for next week.
Well, we are all
looking forward
to finding out what
happens next, aren't we?
MIA: See you later.
Oh, what time is
the party again?
Okay, bye!
See you.
Hey!
You're late.
Sorry.
Who is she?
You're sweaty. Come, you
have to do the cake.
Hey, birthday girl!
Daddy!
Happy birthday.
It's a teddy bear!
We got you something else, too.
Wow, thanks.
It's so cool!
I've wanted one
of them for ages!
Great.
Oh, yes.
You know, it's actually an
antique, it's nearly 50 years old.
An old
teddy bear. Cool.
I love it, Dad, really.
So, how old are you again?
Nine? Ten?
Dad.
Four?
Okay, guys.
It's time.
ALL:
Whoo!
MIA: Hollowface woke up because
someone called his name.
After many, many
years, he was free.
When Hollowface
came out of his lair,
the people looked
right through him.
He saw people in the street,
talking and kissing.
And he knew that, without a
face, no one could love him.
Hollowface kept hunting for
a boy to steal his face.
He looked everywhere, in
every window of every house.
Until one night, he found a
house with a child inside.
where he saw a girl
who was still awake.
And he forgot all about
hunting for the boy.
Now, Hollowface
wanted the girl's face
more than anything else
in the world.
He would hide in the
dark corner of her room
and wait for her to go to
sleep, and then he would...
I really want one.
One?
Just one.
No.
Yes, just one.
No.
No, don't.
You don't need it.
I do.
That's pathetic.
Mia.
Mia, go to your room.
JOHN: What is it? What's
the matter, sweetheart?
Mia, you've school
tomorrow, go.
John.
Come on, it's her birthday.
Are you okay, birthday girl?
I can't sleep.
Too much Coca-Cola?
It's not that.
No? What is it then?
Come on,
let's get you into bed.
Oh, I can see
you love my present.
Dad, I'm 12 years old.
Did you hear that?
Sorry, mate, I think you
should've stayed in the shop.
Looks like she is just a little
bit too grown-up for you.
Oh, yeah. She's wearing
lipstick and everything.
Come on,
you should try to sleep.
Good night, sweetheart.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too.
One, two, three, four, five.
"He was a murderer
from the beginning,
and did not abide in the truth,
because there is
no truth in him.
If ye continue in my word,
then ye are
my disciples indeed.
And ye shall know the truth,
and the truth
will make you free."
Wait for us here.
We can do it here if you like.
You have to say, "Hail,
Mary, full of grace."
Hail, Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
When was your last confession?
I don't know.
I don't remember.
That's okay.
Go ahead, tell me.
You needn't be ashamed.
The Lord is good
and always forgives us.
Come on.
It can't be that bad.
Come on, Juan.
We're leaving.
JOHN: No, no, no.
Keep going.
Sorry, mate.
Come on, you.
Concentrate.
You've gotta get
all that done by today.
You're the boss.
FRANK: Help!
Help!
Help!
Please, mate, hurry,
I'm gonna fall!
John, help!
I can't hold on. Come on,
John, hurry up, mate!
Hurry up, I'm gonna
fucking let it go.
Hold on!
John!
FRANK:
JOHN: Frank!
Frank! Frank!
Dad?
Jesus.
You scared the life out of me!
Are you okay, sweetheart?
What's the matter?
I had a nightmare.
What was it about?
Come, Mia.
Come on, let's go back to bed.
You have school tomorrow.
What if the nightmare
comes back?
Come on.
Dad, where are we going?
Come on, it's fine.
JOHN: Shit.
Dad.
Why are you standing
out there? Come on.
What are you doing?
Yes, got it.
Do you remember this?
The anti-nightmare book!
Dad, this is ridiculous.
Come on. Come and sit down.
Haven't read this in ages.
Come on.
Now, which one shall we read?
That one.
This one?
Okay. So...
"if a big red devil with big
teeth and claws comes to you
"and tries to squeeze you in its
jaws, just light it up and say..."
Dad.
Oh, you're
too grown... "Boo!"
"And you'll see it's just a shadow
and you can see it through."
See, monsters are cowards.
If you stand up to them,
they run away.
Not this one.
This one's different.
They're all the same.
All cowards.
And you know
they'd never dare come
into this house if
they know I'm here.
But he's already inside.
What do you mean?
Where?
I don't know.
I think he spies on me
when I'm asleep.
I know he's there.
Right.
Now,
to kill a monster, you
have to enter their story.
See, they think
you're gonna run away,
but if you enter their story,
they're screwed.
So...
Now, there's something missing.
Ah! Perfect.
Wow! There he is.
There's our monster.
So,
you think you're scary, huh?
Now, listen, mate.
It's the end of the road.
We've had enough.
You cannot keep bothering
my daughter at night.
Okay, stand back.
JOHN: Whoa.
Look at him go.
Wow.
Basketball face, go.
Look at his face.
Ooh.
Spooky.
He looks so angry.
What the hell are you doing?
Are you crazy?
What is this?
Mia, go to your room.
It's all right.
We were just playing.
What do you mean "playing"? You
could have burned the house down.
She had a nightmare.
We were just getting rid of it.
What do you mean
"getting rid of it"?
What do you mean?
What is this?
Sue. It was a game.
Throw this thing away before
it stinks up the whole house.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Juan...
It's okay, sweetie.
There, there.
It's over.
Please, come in.
Juan.
Juan.
Father Antonio is
here to see you.
He doesn't seem
to have a fever.
Hi, Juan.
My name is Antonio.
Do you remember me?
Look.
I brought your toy.
I'll leave it here, okay?
Your mother says you're
having trouble sleeping.
Go away.
Why do you say that?
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I had nightmares
at your age too.
They aren't nightmares.
What are you scared of?
Witches?
No such thing.
And the bogeyman
isn't real either.
My parents told me about him
so I'd finish my dinner.
It's just a story.
You needn't be
afraid of stories.
Here's what we'll do:
You tell me what
you're scared of,
and I'll tell you
what scares me, okay?
I have a friend I talk to
every day who I can't see.
I'm scared...
my friend won't answer me.
That I'll talk to him
and he won't say anything.
Now it's your turn.
What are you scared of?
Hollowface.
Who is Hollowface?
Mia, what's the matter?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Tell me.
He's here.
He's inside.
No, come on, sweetheart.
There's nobody here,
it's just you and me.
Look.
Daddy, look.
Mia, get out.
Get out!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Help me!
John!
John, what's going on?
JOHN: Call the police!
Call the police!
Please.
Just let her go.
Don't hurt her.
My God! Sweetheart,
are you okay?
Are you okay?
What's going on?
JOHN: There was a fucking
man in the room.
Are you okay?
Are You okay? Baby...
It's okay, it's okay.
Awful business.
JOHN: I think he must've
come in through the window.
I chased after him,
but he'd gone.
Did you see his face? Could
you give us a description?
It was dark.
He had a hood on.
Get that to forensics, George.
Now, once an intruder
has been seen,
he very rarely comes back.
We'll get him.
Don't worry, Mr Farrow.
Thank you.
He said not to worry. He said
he definitely won't come back.
It's okay.
You sit down here, lovely.
Has she said anything?
What do you want her to say?
She's terrified.
Are you okay?
What is it, sweetheart?
Talk to me.
Mia.
Talk to me.
Sweetheart,
tell me what's wrong.
Mia.
Sweetheart, what is it?
One, two, three, four...
Mommy, Mommy!
Juan...
How are you?
Everything okay?
No wonder the father ran off.
Did she tell you that?
No.
She speaks only of a presence,
that there's something
inside the boy.
They're both nuts,
the boy and the mother.
They would spook anyone.
She told you more
than she told me.
You don't know
how to treat women.
Will you help them?
What do you want me to do?
I don't know. Make them
think you got rid of it.
Got rid of what?
We're talking about
something very serious.
It wouldn't have
to be official.
It would be like a placebo.
Antonio, you can't perform
such a serious ritual
just to settle the nerves
of a crazy woman.
No matter how pretty she is.
You can't play around
with this stuff, damn it.
Leave them alone.
This is a job
for a psychiatrist,
not for us.
And then he leapt
from your window?
Oh, Mia. I'm sorry.
What a terrible thing to go
through, it must be terrifying!
And you haven't been able
to speak ever since?
Or you haven't wanted to?
Things and...
It's important I know.
You can't.
You know, it's all
right to be afraid.
I get scared too sometimes.
Everyone does.
Please, come with me.
As there's nothing physically
preventing your daughter from speaking,
her silence is an acute
emotional response
to the severe shock
she experienced.
So what do we do?
Oh, you have to be patient.
Should she keep
going to school?
Oh, yes, absolutely.
You don't want to
disrupt her routine,
but I will need to
see Mia every day.
Every day?
Mr Farrow,
I'm sure you want to avoid
Mia re-living the experience
through flashbacks
or recurring nightmares.
We want to facilitate
the successful,
emotional processing
of the trauma through
basic counselling.
During the sessions, Mia
will confront her fears.
We've found the method to be extremely
effective for the children...
MIA: Hollowface
did not give up.
He would wait for the right moment
to rip off the girl's face.
Hollowface crept closer,
and closer and closer.
You haven't got one
that's a bit quieter?
Quieter?
Wouldn't have a Chihuahua
as a guard dog, would you?
This is a Rottweiler.
It's an excellent choice.
Complete security package.
No more worries.
How about...
I made you something to eat.
You're doing your homework?
Listen, Mia, you don't have to
do it if you don't want to.
"Want to." Okay.
Come, come here.
Come here. Sit.
MAN: You can
only access the images
on the central Web site
with a password.
It's very secure.
Yes, hi, mate, yeah. I need to
enter a password for a customer.
Name, John Farrow.
Yep.
One, nine, six, seven.
Hi, Juan.
How are you?
Remember me?
Juan.
Mommy, I'm having fun!
We're leaving.
We can't be here.
Let's go.
Come on.
Juan...
MIA: Hollowface crept
closer, and closer.
The girl knew that
Hollowface was there.
She could feel him
watching her.
but when she opened her mouth
she couldn't make a sound.
Her parents couldn't
keep her safe
because Hollowface
was already inside.
He'd made a new lair
right in her room,
in a dark corner everyone
had forgotten about.
His new lair was big
enough for both of them.
Hollowface would drag
the girl into his lair
imprison her, away from
her parents, forever.
Then she wouldn't
need her face ever again.
He started calling her
to his lair.
She felt his claws
reaching out to her.
John!
Mia, are you okay?
Are you okay?
DR ROY: She's fine now. Her
blood pressure is very low.
We're going to run
some allergy tests.
Anaphylactic shock is a severe
hypersensitivity body reaction,
but I don't want you
to worry, Mrs Farrow,
we will find what triggered it.
In the meantime,
I'm gonna prescribe
some intravenous
adrenaline and sedatives
in case of emergency.
If she loses consciousness and
the ambulance takes too long,
you can inject it yourself.
It takes only a couple of
seconds to take effect.
I'll have a nurse
show you how it works.
Okay. Thank you.
I'll go get a nurse.
OFFICER: Could you
give us a description?
Yeah, he looked really weird.
It was like...
It was like he was deformed.
Deformed?
But it's a good job you installed
those security cameras.
I'll have one of my men
check the coverage.
But we'll need your password.
Yeah, of course.
Sorry, would you excuse me?
Hey, how is she?
She's all right.
She's all right.
SUSAN NA: It's Dave.
Please, take him. He's been
calling the whole time.
Hello?
Mrs Farrow,
can you tell me
what happened tonight?
DAVE ON PHONE: I'm calling
because your mother asked me to.
be...
Don't worry.
Everything's fine.
I'm taking care
of the situation.
She is worried about Mia.
How is she, John?
I didn't see him.
I just...
Dave, I can't talk right now.
Sorry, I've gotta go.
Dave, how are they?
They'll be fine.
Sit down.
Come with me, Juan.
Lie down.
We're going to pray together.
I'm going to say a prayer
and repeat after me, all right?
Mommy says you're going to
make Hollowface go away.
That's right.
Jesus will come,
he'll grab Hollowface
and poof.
He'll throw him into a pit
so deep he'll never get out.
But Hollowface can fly.
Juan, keep quiet
and obey the father.
Cross yourselves.
Give me your hand.
"You, Lord, are my refuge.
He shall deliver thee from
the snare of the fowler
and from
the noisome pestilence."
Repeat it.
"You, Lord, are my refuge.
He shall deliver thee from
the snare of the fowler
and from
the noisome..."
"From
the noisome pestilence."
"From
the noisome pestilence."
"Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night,
nor for the arrow
that flieth by day."
Juan.
Please.
I don't want to.
That's all right.
We'll try something else.
I'll pray
and you repeat it
to yourself in silence.
Close your eyes.
"Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night,
nor for the arrow
that flieth by day."
I can't.
I can't do it.
I can't expel him
if I don't know who he is.
You know who he is, don't you?
He has no face.
His face is hidden.
I can't see it.
You can't see it because
he's wearing a hood, right?
Close your eyes.
Try to imagine his face.
Take it off.
Take off his hood.
Father, that's enough.
Good, Juan.
Good.
He's there.
Where, Juan?
There.
Where is he?
There's nothing there.
What do you see?
He's gone.
It's only a statue.
Luisa.
You can't help us.
There's nothing you can do.
It's only a statue.
You imagined the whole thing.
Luisa!
Luisa...
Tell me what you saw.
Mommy, where are we going?
I don't know.
Far away.
Juan, help me.
Close your suitcase.
Do you think he'll follow us?
No, because we're going far away.
Do you understand?
You saw him too, didn't you?
Juan, I didn't see anything.
You hear me?
Nothing.
What's going on?
Good morning, John.
Come through.
Is everything okay?
Sue, where's Mia?
Is she okay?
DR RACHEL: She's here, John.
She'll be fine.
Hello, John.
What is this?
Please, John, take a seat.
Mia knows that
she has the full love
and support of
both her parents,
especially you, John.
You have a very
special bond with her.
I should hope so,
I'm her father.
Susanna tells me that you haven't slept
well since your incident at work.
Well, I think we've
all had trouble sleeping
ever since a man
started appearing
in my daughter's
bedroom at night.
I understand.
John, there is
a very rare syndrome,
which is often
brought on by stress,
which occurs when two people's
psyches become entwined.
It's a shared disorder,
called
When two people with
close emotional ties
share the same hallucination.
Hallucination?
There's no intruder, John.
It's in your imagination
and in Mia's.
What the fuck are
you talking about?
John, I'd like you to
look at this, please.
Play that again.
What is this?
There was no one there, John.
Nobody else in the room,
but you and your daughter.
Mr Farrow.
Who the fuck are you?
This is David Wareton
from Social Services.
We're all here
to help you, John.
The condition can be treated very
successfully through therapy,
but, John,
the first step will be
to separate you
from Mia for a while.
If you have nowhere else to go,
we can help you out with that.
I recommend that you speak
to my colleague, Dr Nowinski.
He said he'll treat you.
This is ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense.
I was in the fucking room!
He was there, he was
attacking my daughter.
Sue, you were there, tell them.
Sue.
Tell them!
Mr Farrow,
you need to calm down.
I didn't see anything.
You saw the video.
There's nobody there.
I don't fucking believe you.
JOHN: So you think
I'm crazy, do you?
Don't worry.
By the time you get home,
I'll be out.
SUSANNA: Mia,
when we get home,
Daddy is not gonna be there.
We have to separate you
for a little while.
Mum says you've been
writing a story at school.
Who is Hollowface?
Susanna, it might
be easier for Mia
if you left us alone
for a minute.
Mia, is there something
you want to tell us?
Did your father
tell you the story?
You know Hollowface isn't real?
OFFICER:
Okay, Mrs Farrow...
If he comes near
the house again,
Mrs Farrow, please let
us know immediately.
Yes, I will.
We can get a court order.
No, no, no.
It won't be necessary,
seriously.
Okay.
So, this is the room.
It's a nice room, Mia.
Do you mind if we talk outside?
Mia, I'm gonna be back
in a minute, yeah?
SUSAN NA: Mia.
What if we go for a nice
yummy meal tonight?
Yeah? Like a Chinese restaurant?
What do you think?
Good idea?
Let's go.
MAN: Luisa,
can I speak with you
when you have a minute?
He says he wants
to talk to you.
Mommy!
Mommy!
MAN: Don't worry, it must
just be a nightmare.
I'm sure he'll calm down.
Mommy!
One, two, three,
four, five.
There you'll stay forever.
MIA: Hollowface woke up because
someone called his name.
he was free.
John?
He's back.
Who is back?
You know who.
I don't know what
you're talking about, son.
Yes, you do.
No.
It can't be.
You said I made him up.
That I was dreaming.
You lied to me.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
He's hurting Mia.
I was only trying
to protect you.
From what?
Son...
Forgive me.
Tell me.
I'm sorry, I had to lie to you.
He came to take you that night.
It wasn't a nightmare.
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Three, four, five...
Come on. Baby!
It's me!
John, she can't breathe!
What's happening?
The shot's not working.
Call an ambulance!
It's me. I'm here.
Can you hear me?
I know he's here and I know you're
afraid, but that's all over now,
because I know who he is
and I know why he came back.
Come on, keep talking,
keep talking, keep talking.
Hollowface woke up because
someone called his name.
After many, many
years, he was free.
He wasn't young or old,
ugly or handsome.
He had no shape,
he didn't even have a face.
They had locked him away in a dark,
tiny hole where the sun never shone.
He remembered a boy with a
face that looks like him.
When he finally found
where the boy was hiding,
Hollowface didn't
know what to do.
Seeing the mother kiss the
boy made him feel envious.
He wanted to be loved.
So he devised a plan.
First, he'd separate
the boy from his mother.
Then he'd bring him
to his lair.
And he would rip off his
face and wear it himself.
You don't know the rest
of the story, but I do.
Hollowface couldn't find the
boy and that made him furious.
Where's the boy?
Leave her alone, monster!
Don't be afraid, son.
You look like me.
Mia.
Mia, you have to fight back.
You have to.
Mia.
You have to fight back.
You have to fight back, Mia.
Hollowface never
stole the boy's face.
Because Hollowface
didn't realise something.
The boy's mother
would never let him take
her son away without
putting up a fight.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Help me, son!
Help me!
No.
Because parents
are always willing
to do anything
to protect their children.
It's all right.
I'm here.
You're safe.
He's gone.
He will never come
back again, I promise.
It's over.
JOHN: Hollowface woke up because
someone called his name.
Hollowface wasn't old or
young, ugly or handsome.
He had no shape, he
didn't even have a face.
