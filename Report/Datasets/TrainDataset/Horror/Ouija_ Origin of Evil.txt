Let's begin.
Very good.
What was your wife's name?
- Mary.
- Mary, alright.
He seeks the spirit
of Mary Browning.
Mary, we invite you
into our circle.
Mary Browning,
we invite you into our circle.
- We seek you in love and light.
- Dad, don't give this woman our money.
Mary.
Mary, if that's you,
give us a sign.
Blow out the candles.
Welcome, Mary.
You may ask three questions.
Why just three?
Mary, we ask that you let
the candle burn if the answer is "Yes".
Blow it out
if the answer is "No".
Ask your question, sir.
Marry.
Are you in pain,
anymore?
She's not
The pain she felt
before she passed,
she's saying it was an illness.
- Cancer?
- Yeah.
She's restored.
She's...
She's young again, beautiful.
Beautiful forever now.
Mary, I...
Can you forgive me?
For all the things.
She says yes.
She forgives you.
And she ask for
your forgiveness in return.
Okay, I don't know
how are you doing...
Do not break the circle.
Anyone can shake a table
with their knee.
She won't be here much longer.
Ask your last question.
I...
I have to ask you about Jenny.
She's seeing this young man, Don,
and
- they want a lot of money for me.
- Don't.
I have to mortgage the house.
It's suppose to be a terrific investment
and he says he'll marry her
if it turns out right.
Okay.
I don't know how she's doing this
but this is a scam, Dad.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
The spirit world is unpredictable.
She sounded angry,
so angry.
It's hard to explain.
Well, uh.
- Thank you for your time.
- Oh, no, no, no.
No, I can't
Just remember what
she came to say.
She's at peace and she loves you.
That's all to take away from today.
The rest is the business of the living.
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, thank you.
What was that?
You almost gave that poor man
a heart attack.
Paulina Zander, get in here.
She deserved it, Mom.
She was just trying to steal her dad's money.
That isn't what we do here.
It's our job to comfort them
not judge them.
It's your job
to stand at the curtains,
and not attack the clients.
- And you, young lady.
- I heard screaming, I got scared.
I didn't mean
to knock things down.
This is unacceptable.
That lady was unacceptable.
She's a real bitch.
Witch.
I'm not sorry.
It caused us $5.
Let me see that.
He is so much weight on the table,
it was hard for me to latch on.
What's a scam?
The lady said we were a scam.
Doris, listen to me.
Scam is a lie.
We don't lie
We help people.
We give them closure.
We give them peace.
We...
We heal their hearts.
And that's not something that can happen
without some showmanship.
We tell them the true.
We just need to help them believe it.
Oh.
Okay.
Well, we're going to need to
spice that showmanship up a little
because it's getting kind of stale.
And if we aren't here to judge them
why did you blow out the last candle?
Well, none of us is perfect, Lina.
She really was a bitch, wasn't she?
You are Miss Lizzy Borden,
I presume.
I must say you are
not exactly what I expected.
I'm not Miss. Lizzy.
I'm Emma.
Oh, the sister.
Mm.
Well, let's see, it's been a year
since your mother and father were...
Oh, Mom.
Oh.
I'm sorry, sweetie, it's a school night.
My sister was acquitted.
And we never talk about it.
Of course you don't.
But the public is interested, you know.
Now, I represent the
Sacramento Record.
- You're one of those reporters?
- That's right.
I'm saying good night now
because I'm tired
and I didn't have
a very good day at school.
Because Terry is still
picking on my skirt.
So, please send us the money
to buy a new skirt.
Oh, and
Lina got in trouble again.
I was good though.
I love you
and I missed you everyday.
Good night, Daddy.
Amen.
Why don't you pray anymore, Mommy?
Who says I don't pray?
You used to pray everyday
with Daddy and me.
But, since he's gone,
you never do.
You're still praying to daddy?
Remember what Father Tom says.
You're suppose to pray to god.
I rather talk to Daddy,
but he never answers.
The people we helped.
Their mommies and daddies
in heaven talked to them.
Why doesn't Daddy talk to us?
Just because you can't hear him
doesn't mean he isn't there.
What is it?
Just saying good night.
Good night.
Took you long enough.
Hey, Zander.
Lina, Lina, bambino,
pour her a coffee cup.
It's a little late for caffeine.
My mom left her keys out.
Groovy.
When is she going to be back?
From her bridge game?
Usually after midnight
smelling a lot like coffee
if you get me.
You want some?
I don't think so.
I mean, why not?
We see the moon everyday.
Why can't one of us just
go on it.
There's so many things
that prevent us.
I'm with Betty on it.
- Yeah.
- I don't see why not.
Yeah, they just put the big...
the helmets on.
My mom just got that.
She and her bridge club friends
play it sometimes.
Is that the board
you talk to ghost?
Uh, then.
No, thanks.
I get enough of that at home.
It's actually really scary.
You guys want to play?
We could just make conversation.
The rules.
Never play alone.
Never play in a graveyard.
Always say good bye.
Circle once for each player.
Come on.
Come on.
As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true,
spirits near,
we call to you.
Is there a spirit here?
Oh my god.
Relax, Betty.
Are you in the room with us?
Oh my god.
- Ellie, are you-are you doing that?
- No, I swear.
Ask your questions.
What's it like
on the other side.
COLD
Oh my god.
Okay.
Here's how it works, alright?
We all have our hands on it
so we can't tell who moves it.
We react to the slightest pull
by helping it moves subconsciously.
Okay.
I mean, this game was designed
to make us scare ourselves.
- Yeah.
- There's nothing on the other side, believe me.
- Okay.
- You're no fun.
Okay. Well, if we're just
talking to ourselves then.
Uh, Spirit.
Will Lina come to
homecoming with me?
- Stop it, Ellie.
- It's the spirit.
Guys, this is really starting
to freak me out.
- There's no spirit, Betty.
- Okay.
Spirit, prove to us
that you're here.
Give us a sign.
Yeah, you're right.
See.
Yeah, there's no spirit.
There's no spirit.
Ellie!
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- Get in.
Why do you do these things?
If you're going to ground me
just do it already.
Because it worked so well
the last time.
- We were just playing a stupid game.
- I can smell your breath.
I know how hard it's been for you
and I understand how you feel.
But I need you
to help me, Lina.
For all of us.
I'm asking, honey.
I'll try.
Really, a Ouija board?
It's actually pretty fun.
You should consider
adding one to the act.
The soil was brought back
to the Earth.
Eight guest scientists
will join fourteen others
at the Ames Research Center
near San Francisco,
to analyze it for
evidence of life.
Honey, please sit with us.
Just once I want to have
a normal family breakfast.
Actually I'm going to be late this morning
so I'm going to walk.
Don't be silly, have some food.
I'll drop you off.
No, it's alright, Mom.
I'm walking with a friend.
Who?
Just a friend.
So, I got to go.
I'll get it.
No. No, Doris.
That's okay, I got it.
See who it is first.
It's some boy.
Really?
Hi, young lady,
is Lina home?
Yeah, she's right here.
Hey, ready to go?
Hi.
Who are you?
He's just a friend.
Hi, Mrs. Zander,
I'm Mikey.
- Are you ready to go?
- Not quite.
If you guys are walking to school
why don't you take your sister with you.
I can use the morning
to run some errands.
- But Mom, I have class.
- Thanks, honey.
I need my shoes.
Go help your sister get ready.
Come on, pipsqueak.
Wow, this is.
This is a beautiful home.
Mm.
Is there where you
do the seances?
Readings.
Come on in.
Have you ever
had your palm read.
Can't say I have, Mrs. Zander.
It's totally painless.
Mm, southpaw.
My husband was a lefty.
This is your head line.
This is your life line.
This is your heart line.
You're wearing a senior jacket,
how old are you?
I'm 17.
Lina's a sophomore, you realise.
Yes, ma'am.
What's wrong?
It's your life line.
You see how this curves here.
This could mean a few things.
- This is your dominant hand, right?
- Mm-hm.
I'll tell you this for sure.
If this hand or any other hand,
for that matter,
touches my daughter
in a way I don't like.
Ah.
I hate to see something happened
to your life line.
- You dig.
- Yes, ma'am.
Now off you go.
Repower and economy.
You need to see the new Rambler.
The new Ramblers are in
are your local Rambler dealer.
Dawson's Hardware, your friendly neighborhood
hardware supplier is having our annual super sale at...
- Is it true that your mom's a witch?
- You are so weird.
- Are those cobwebs in your hair?
- Inky little witch.
Doris the dorkest.
Doris the dorkest.
That's enough.
Go on.
Okay, let's go.
You know why people
say mean things, right?
Why?
Because they're scared.
It makes me kind of
feel sorry for them.
How about you?
Yeah, I feel bad for him.
Alright, off you go,
I'll be right there.
Thank you, father.
Does she have a lot of problems
with other kids?
Oh, she has her fair share
but it's nothing to concern at all.
She's been slow making friends
since her dad...
I know.
I talked about that with her.
It's very good of you.
She's a lovely girl,
it's really no trouble.
Thank you, father.
Maybe you could invite Father Tom
over for a reading.
I don't know if Father Tom
would want a reading, sweetheart.
So he can talk to his wife.
He's a priest.
They're not allowed to have wives.
He had one
before he was a priest.
She died,
just like Daddy.
Hey, what's this?
New prop, for work
Is there a presence here with us?
What is your name?
Marcus.
Yes.
No.
Who are you talking to, Doris?
Spirit, can you hear me?
Yes, we can.
And we can see you.
That will work.
What was that all about?
What?
Roger.
Honey, are you there?
I'm here.
Are you there?
HIFRIEND
Hi, friend.
Now what?
Who are you?
Cut it out, Doris.
Doris?
Doris?
This is a little awkward
but I had to ask you
because it just seem
well, so unusual.
Have you been helping Doris
with her homework?
Oh god, uh.
Maybe not as much as I could,
I'm sorry.
Is she falling behind?
I can help her more.
It's nothing like that.
In fact,
unless she has learned cursive, then
somebody's been helping her quite a bit.
Um.
No.
Doris, who helped you with this?
My new friend.
Who's your new friend?
- I didn't do it.
- Well, I didn't.
And Doris definitely didn't.
Well, I don't know what to tell you
if... it wasn't me.
Did your sister do
your homework for you?
I told you, no.
Your new friend did.
I let her used my hand.
Do you think we'll have to move?
I don't know, sweetie.
Dad won't like this.
I should tell him.
As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true,
spirits near,
we call to you.
Daddy.
Did you hear that?
We may have to
move out of our house.
I'm sorry, Mom.
It's not right.
This was your dad's house.
Our house.
This is where
he wanted us to live.
If there is any part of him left,
it's here.
In these walls.
Doris doesn't really quite get it,
does she?
No.
She thinks he just left,
like he went to work.
It's better than getting hit by
some asshole drive and drunk.
I think,
it's best she doesn't understand.
I wish he could watch
you girls grow up.
So he could see
the women you'll be.
Here you go.
What's that, honey?
It's for us.
Where-Where did you find this?
It's over here.
There's no more, I checked.
They're from people
who were here before.
How did you find out about that?
Daddy told me,
with the board.
Come on.
As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true,
spirits near,
we call to you.
Daddy.
We found the money.
Thank you.
It's hard to hear him sometimes.
Like a car radio when
we go into a tunnel.
You can hear him?
Whispers.
They are tough to make out.
But I can hear them a little better
when I'm at the board.
A lot better if I touch
the planchette.
Doris, this is mean.
It's okay, Lina.
Daddy, are you here?
Stop it.
Okay, then.
Roger, if this is you,
When I told you
I was pregnant with Lina,
where were you when I told you?
SHOWER
Is she right?
He doesn't really need me.
Isn't that right, Daddy?
What are you looking at?
Sometimes I can see them,
through this.
But I haven't seen Daddy yet.
But I want to.
Roger.
Are you really here?
Look, she could've
manipulated the board in
any number of ways.
- You know that better than anyone.
- It's real.
What we've been doing here.
What we thought we where doing here.
We can truly help people.
We can actually do what
we've been pretending to do.
And Lina,
we can talk to Daddy again.
But how, Mom?
It's just a stupid game.
My mother was a fortune teller
before I was born.
Read tea leaves.
Tarot cards.
I thought it was silly.
I thought she was pathetic.
I thought it was all a scam.
Maybe she was right.
Maybe it just skips generations.
I'm gonna
take this to the bank in the morning.
I knew your father
would take care of us.
Good night, Mom.
Yeah, I guess I'm not allow
over there anymore.
Ellie's mom told my dad, he flipped.
Hell. It's not like he isn't hitting
one bottle or another
before he comes home from work.
Were you serious?
About what?
About homecoming.
Why?
I don't know.
I mean, yeah.
Yeah sure, I was.
We can go if you wanted to.
Or not.
It's just a dumb dance.
I do.
I want to go.
Great.
Sorry uh.
I'm just uh surprise.
You seem too cool
for these kind of things.
I'm not.
I'm not cool, I mean.
I bet you're wrong about that?
Mr. Russell.
Not much room for the holy ghost
is there, Mikey?
Three is a crowd?
Miss. Zander, could I have a word?
No offense, Father, but
I don't need to make room for
another ghost in my life right now.
Holy or not.
No, it's not about that.
You're a smart young lady.
I imagine you can trust yourself
not to make bad decisions.
But boys his age,
they require discouragement.
It makes them a better man
in the long run.
Oh.
Well, thank you.
I guess.
I actually wanted to talk
to you about your sister.
It's 4 days in a roll now
that she's been absent,
why is that?
It's complicated.
Usually when she's sick
you mother sends a note
or she comes by
and picks up her homework.
She's not sick.
She and my mom
have been working.
What do you mean?
Let's see if we can
reach your father?
What do you want to tell him?
Um.
Do I make him proud?
Is he proud of me?
Always.
That tickled.
I can't thank you enough.
That was amazing.
Can I come back tomorrow?
Of course,
it's our pleasure.
Lina.
Lina.
My neck hurts.
Take this.
If it get's worse we'll wake Mom up.
It stings,
like a bee.
You will feel better in a bit.
Good night, squirt.
As friends we've gathered,
blah blah blah.
What happened to my neck?
Daddy.
It hurts.
She belongs to me now.
Mabel, Mabel, set the table,
Do it as fast as you are able.
Don't forget the
SALT, PEPPER, KETCHUP, MUSTARD.
She got the freak.
She's so weird.
Oh.
What are you doing?
Hey, keep an eye out.
What are you planning on doing it?
Stop it!
Stop it, Jack!
Somebody!
Please help!
- Is he okay?
- No!
At Cape Canaveral,
another probe into space.
Target: The Moon.
A 52 ton...
Lina, call the restaurant
if you need anything.
Mom.
What?
No, you just look...
What?
Nothing.
Nothing, you just look nice.
I'll be a few hours, tops.
In bed by nine.
And you have the number for the restaurant
- ...if you need anything.
- I know.
Homework.
I know.
Go.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Oh, no.
Not at all, please.
This is lovely.
I've been by here so many times
but I've never come inside.
Well, I thought you could use
a night away from cooking.
You're absolutely right.
Some night times I'm so frazzled
I didn't even bother
to heat up the spaghettiOs.
Oh god, please forget that.
I'm really not a bad mother.
Oh.
I have cold spaghettiOs twice a week.
Twice a week at least.
I keep a case at the rectory.
Actually I invited you here
because I wanted to discuss
the girls at home,
out of their earshot.
I won't have it, Lizzie.
I'll die first.
- Hey, come on in.
- Hey.
But I don't have to die, do I?
Oh.
Hello, kiddo.
Hey, thanks for...
Well, I have some
records up in my room
and she's just going to watch TV
so we should go...
upstairs.
I do what I have to do.
The rest takes care of itself.
If you tell Mom he was here,
I promise you I'm going to melt
each and every single one
of your dolls
until they are just a giant blob
of hair and arms, do you understand?
- As soon as I saw the axe, I knew.
- Wait, Emma.
I'm not an expert
on the occult.
I'm not either
to be honest.
The spirit world is dangerous.
The thing is...
what we do for people.
It's not dangerous.
It's good, father.
It's good work.
I wish you would
let me show you.
Let me help you
talk to your wife.
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I assumed,
you want to.
Who says I don't want to?
I didn't have a chance
to tell her all the things
I wanted to tell her
before she passed away.
Mm, we never do.
But...
I've always felt that anything
I didn't say,
she already knows.
Gloria and I, we used to
come here once a month.
Roger always ordered wine
with a French accent.
It was...
so bad.
It felt like those days
were over for me, so...
I felt that they were, after.
Well.
I guess I kind of
make sure of that, didn't I?
Well, they were over
before the seminary.
I didn't think this through.
Maybe in another life.
Here's to another life then.
You know, it's... It's awesome
you don't have to move.
Such a great house.
It's...
It's classic
It's great bones.
Uh.
Sorry, my...
My dad's an architect.
His idea of a good time is
driving me and my brother
around and looking at houses.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm really glad
you're not moving.
My mom is going
to be home soon.
I thought you said another hour.
I'm not taking any chances.
She will seriously kill you
and me.
Romeo and Juliet.
More like Bonnie and Clyde,
sadly for us.
Well.
Good night.
Good night.
Hey, kiddo.
Christ.
You scared the crap out of me.
Want to hear something cool?
Sure.
Do you know what it feels like
to be strangled to death?
First, you feel the pressure
in your throat.
Your eyes water.
And you start to taste something
very, very sour in your mouth.
Then it's like someone lights a match,
right in the middle of your chest.
And that fire grows.
It fills your lungs
and your throat.
And all the way
behind your eyes.
And finally,
that fire turns to ice.
Like pins and needles of ice,
they're sticking into your fingers,
your toes,
your arms.
You see stars
then darkness.
And the last thing you feel
...is cold.
Good night, Romeo.
What the hell
did you do this for?
I didn't.
Dad gave me this
and you know that.
I didn't do it.
Daddy did,
to stop the voices.
You stop this, Doris.
This isn't funny anymore, you stop it.
What?
What is all the yelling?
Look what she did.
Did you do this?
No.
She's lying.
Something is wrong with her.
- You're either too stupid or too stubborn to see it.
- You watch your tongue, young lady.
You two can live in this
fantasy world all you want
but you can leave me
out of it.
And You know what?
You can leave Dad out of it too.
You can't talk to me that way.
I don't know how else
to make you hear me.
Your sister, she's been through
just as much as you have.
- She's dealing the same thing that you're dealing with.
- Something is wrong with Doris!
She is experiencing
something amazing.
So am I!
I wish you would join us.
It can help you heal.
Have you listen to
what she is saying
with that stupid board
is actually saying?
- Yes, everyday.
- Basic things.
"Forgiveness", "I'm so proud of you",
"I missed you."
Things that you used to
tell your clients
because you knew they
would want to believe it.
You know how that works,
you taught me.
No.
She knows things.
I asked her specific questions,
you heard me.
Things only he could know.
How do you explain that?
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I know this is hard to accept, honey,
but...
something is happening here
that we can't understand.
It's changing Doris.
It's changing her and I know
you see that at least a little.
If it was Dad,
if it really was him,
then why would he change her?
Why would he ever do
anything to change her?
We're going to be late.
I don't want to go to school.
I know, honey,
but we've missed too much.
Did you do your homework?
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.
I DON'T WANT TO GO!
Lina, will you get your sister's things
out of her room?
No.
I don't want to go.
I want to stay here
and talk to my friends.
Lina, come in.
Father.
What can I do for you?
I don't know how
to ask you this, but...
Is there anyone at the school
who speaks Polish?
I'm not sure.
Why?
I found these at my house
and...
I just want to know
what they say.
I think they maybe in Polish,
but...
Doris wrote them.
- I'm not sure I understand...
- I saw her.
I believe Sister Hannah came here
from Poland during the war. I can...
I can ask her
to look at them.
Lina.
What are these?
Hopefully nothing, father.
Father.
What a nice surprise.
I'm sorry to call on you
like this.
I was hoping I could
take you up on that reading.
Oh, uh.
Please come in.
...the landing field by
U.S. astronauts in 1970.
I gotta say I'm surprise.
I thought...
I thought you were
against the idea of...
I changed my mind.
Astronauts walk and work.
Their capsules make...
Hi, father.
Lina, hi.
I thought I would see first hand
what all the fuss was about.
Doris, would you be willing to...
In a series of pinpoint bull's eye splashdowns
Gloria is your wife's name, right?
That's right.
Gloria.
Are you here?
Darling.
She's a little hard to hear.
IMISSEDYOU
You missed me.
Gloria, what's your middle name?
Lynn.
Is that right?
Remarkable.
You forgive me?
For what?
FIGHT
Thank you, love.
But what was that fight about?
She says it's not important.
DON'T
HIDE
BEHIND
COLLAR
WANT YOU
TO BE
Happy.
That was something.
Thank you, Doris, for doing that.
I'm afraid that's not the
only reason I came by.
Lina's gotten herself
in some trouble in school.
What?
Isn't that right, Lina?
I'm sorry, Mom.
What kind of trouble?
I rather not talk about it here.
Is there somewhere we can
speak in private?
Um, we can talk in
your office in the morning.
I prefer to speak to you about it
right now, if that's alright?
I promise it won't take long.
We can go up to my room.
I want to come.
How old are you now, Doris?
Nine.
Nine, well.
You're practically a young lady.
You think you can manage to
hold down the fort on your own
for a few minutes?
Are you up for that?
What's this about, father?
Can I watch TV?
Of course.
It's right this way.
Where did she write them?
Over there.
Where're you going?
Mom, please.
My wife's middle name was Catherine.
I'm sorry, I...
Is this about your reading?
My mother's middle name was Lynn.
Did you see her writing these,
actually writing them?
- Yes, right over there?
- Um.
Sometimes the medium gets confuse,
different voices...
I tricked her.
What are those?
Do not believe every spirit, but test
the spirits to see whether they are from God.
For many false prophets
have gone out into the world.
John, chapter 4 verse 1.
I thought this was about Lina.
It's about all of you.
Please.
She started by calling me darling,
an easy guess.
A common term of endearment.
Then said she missed me
and appealed to comfort.
Did you bring my
up here to tell me
my 9 year old daughter
is a fraud?
Oh, no.
I don't think she's a fraud.
Not at all.
When I asked for
Gloria's middle name,
I thought the word "Lynn"
as hard as I could.
I repeated it over and over
in my mind.
Why would you do that?
Because when we ask a question
we know the answer to,
we think the answer
as we ask it.
That's right.
And she was listening to me.
I thought "Lynn",
she said "Lynn".
When I asked what
our fight was about,
I cleared my mind.
Just imagine static on a television set.
She changed the subject.
Your wife's voice?
We all heard it.
It was a woman's voice, that's all.
Just a woman's voice.
I'm so shocked to hear it
come from her mouth.
I don't really scrutinized whether
it sounded exactly like Gloria.
And she only says one word,
enough for me to hear
it's a woman
but not enough for anything else.
Accent, inflection,
nothing too familiar.
I don't think your daughter
is a fraud.
I believe she is channeling powers
and forces we do not understand.
But, I'm certain
she was not channeling my wife.
Don't take your badge off.
Hey, Doris.
What's the skinny?
Is Lina home?
Come in.
Actually, not right now.
She and Mom are talking
to the man about us.
They'll be right back.
They...
They left you here alone?
They'll be here any minute.
She said you should wait.
Yeah?
You want to see something neat?
Yeah, maybe I should...
I should come back later.
There's treasure in the walls.
We used it
to pay the bills.
Yeah, I heard about that,
kind of.
The treasure in the walls,
is that for real?
I'll show you.
She'll be here any second.
This is something Doris wrote.
Sister Hannah came here
from Poland during the War.
I asked her to translate them.
It upset her a great deal.
This is a journal from
a man named Marcus,
who grew up in Poland
during the Second World War.
He talks about his family,
how they were rounded up
by the Germans during the invasion.
It's this way.
I found a hole in the wall
behind the furnace
and the money was inside.
It was old and dusty.
I think there's more.
Hannah talks about a doctor
at the camps.
They called him the Devil's doctor
because of his interest
in the occult
and the experiments
he conduct on the patients.
He talks about being
rescued by the Allies.
He came to America
and lived on the streets,
ended up in a mental hospital.
I found some jewelery
in there too.
But I put it back,
for later.
He recognized one of the doctors,
using a different name
but he knew it was
the Devil's doctor.
It's not unlikely a lot of them
fled to America after the war.
And then one night, the doctor
took him out of the hospital
and brought him to his house.
He describes the house.
This house.
He says the doctor
had a secret room
in the basement where the experiments
continued on Marcus and others.
He cut out their tongues.
He severed their vocal cords
and sealed their mouths.
Kept them in the secret basement.
So even his people visited
and socialized upstairs
they couldn't be heard below.
My god.
And he describes his murder
in great detail.
His murder?
The journal doesn't stop there.
There could be
so much more in there.
He talks about after.
After his murder?
Things that can help my family.
He talks about being in the dark
with the others.
Voiceless, cold, insane
And he talks about
the other things in the dark.
Things that were never human.
Things that were taking him over.
You were right.
What you said about this house.
Good bones.
No.
She knew things.
Things only Roger and I knew.
I asked...
You asked about things that
happened inside the house.
Things that you and Dad
said and did after you moved in.
Of course they knew
all of the answers.
They were here
in the house even then.
They were watching.
So we move,
we get her out of the house.
The problem isn't the house,
not anymore.
I've called the Archdiocese, the Vatican
has people who investigate these things.
- I'll ask them to approve an exorcism.
- Shh.
Shh.
Don't say anything else.
They were watching us
all those years
inside the house,
everything we did.
That means they are
watching us now.
Doris, honey.
I'll bring her down.
When I got her,
we get her outside...
No, no, no, no!
No!
- No. No. No.
- Honey.
- No.
- Honey, look at me.
- No.
- Look at me.
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.
We have to find your sister.
What's that?
The basement.
Lina, wait outside.
No.
No way.
No, that's my sister.
This is my house
and I'm going with you.
Besides,
splitting up sounds like the
stupidest idea in the world.
Okay then.
But if we're going down there,
we're burning that thing in the furnace.
Doris.
Doris?
Honey?
Let's burn that.
They're in here.
All of them.
We played in a graveyard.
Do you think that will work?
I honestly don't know.
Mom!
Mom, help.
I'm scared.
Mommy, help me.
You stay here with your daughter.
What about staying together?
If she's in there,
I'll bring her out.
That's where we died.
- Our Father who art in heaven...
- He can't see this house, Father.
If he could,
none of us will still be here.
You're not Doris.
Is Doris still here?
I'm sorry this happened to you.
Come with me.
I can help you.
Yea, though I walk through
the valley in the shadow of death,
I shall fear no evil.
Father?
Where is she?
She's part of the walls now.
And she told me,
the most wonderful,
awful things.
No!
No!
Tom.
- Mom! Mom!
- You got to get out of here!
What do we do?
I don't know...
Mom!
Stop it.
Let her go.
Speak to me.
I'm a vessel.
I can help you.
She's a better vessel.
What do you want from her?
Voice.
Take mine.
You can cut it out
for all I care,
but you leave my girls alone.
Let them go!
Take me!
We'll take all of you.
Dad!
What the hell
did you do this for?
I didn't.
Dad gave me this
and you know that.
I didn't do it.
Daddy did,
to stop the voices.
I didn't do it.
Daddy did,
to stop the voices.
Sweetie, don't.
I just wanted to be able
to talk to Daddy again.
I just wanted you to be
able to talk to Daddy.
He's gone.
He lives in the dark,
and the cold,
and screams and screams and screams...
No, he doesn't
Lina?
I'm sorry, Doris.
Daddy.
Doris?
Doris?
No.
No. No. No...
No.
No.
Oh my god.
Oh god.
Oh god.
My baby.
I had to.
To stop the voices.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Mom?
Mom.
Mom.
It wasn't you.
No.
It wasn't you.
It was my fault.
I love you.
I love you too.
Doris?
Everybody's waiting.
No!
I'm sorry!
Oh god!
No!
Hey, Lina.
Lina.
Lina.
Where did you go just now?
What were we talking about?
Your sister, again.
Right.
Right.
What about her?
I need you
to try to remember,
anything at all
that can help us find her,
- or her body if she's...
- Of course.
Of course.
I'm sorry.
My mother might know.
I think she said something
about where Doris was.
We've been over this.
She's dead because you...
Right, of course.
You've been here two months, Lina.
We can't find your sister,
and still,
we can't have a proper conversation
about what happened to your mother.
My mother.
Really, the only thing that I can say
about my mother is that...
she wanted to know
that we weren't alone,
after my dad died.
And now she knows.
We were never alone.
I'll never be alone.
I'll never be alone again.
Doris?
Are you there?
Are you there?

Miss. Zander?
You have a visitor.
She says she's your niece.
