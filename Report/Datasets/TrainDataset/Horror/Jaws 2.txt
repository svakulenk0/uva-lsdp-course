Come on,
come on, come on.

Where the hell
have you been?
Late.
That I figured. Honey,
this is a big deal for me.
Well, Hendricks had
the keys to the jeep, and
I couldn't find the spares.
Terrific.
Listen, do me a favor.
Act as if you've been
here the whole time.
How do I do that?
Just look bored.
Thank you,
Amity High School Band,
for that eloquent selection.
We're happy once again--
Mama, Michael
won't talk to me.
What are you
doing here, tiger?
Mrs. Silvera couldn't come.
It's okay. It's okay.
And now, this year's
Miss Amity,
Tina Wilcox,
Will cut the ribbon...
officially opening
this luxurious new hotel.
This money tree,
you may have noticed,
is donated by...
Len Peterson, the builder
of Amity Shores Condominiums,
as a gesture of goodwill
towards the community.
Let's hear it for Len.
Thank you, Len.
as a special gift...
to the Amity
Scholarship Fund.
Go ahead, Tina.
Cut it.
That a girl.
And now the Amity
High School Band once again.
Refreshments on
the patio, everyone.
Oh, boy.
#
Brody, how are ya?
Hey, Len,
how are ya?
Hello, Martin.
I think it went well.
Hell of a speech, Larry.
Terrific. Larry, it was
right on the money.
Thank you very much, Len.
Have you met my son Larry?
No, no.
Uh, Larry Junior. Larry,
would you get over here, please?
Don't go away.
Here we go, Larry.
Say hello to Len.
How you doin'?
Hi, Lar.
Nice-lookin' boy.
Ellen.
Honey, would you be a love,
make sure the bar is open...
and everyone is taken
care of and happy, hmm?
Sure.
Yes, sir,
fantastic lady.
Don't know what I
would do without her.
Really?
Neither do I.
How old is
your cousin?
She's 1 7.
She's a senior.
I'm not crazy
about blind dates.
Oh, they're okay if they got
little white canes and tin cups.
That's awful.
Oh, what the hell.
Did your mom put
all this together?
Yeah, it's her job.
She make the punch?
No.
Good.
It's terrible.
#
Hey, you dance?
Nope.
Me neither.
Who you gonna
ask next?
Tina Wilcox.
Ed's girlfriend.
You're crazy.
It doesn't hurt to ask.
Sometimes the most beautiful
girls are the loneliest.
That's a crock of shit.
I know.
Was it the fourth or fifth
night at the Jersey shore?
It was the fourth. I thought
you wouldn't respect me.
I did, I did.
Why don't we
get out of here?
Wanna fool around?
Why not?
You're on.
This pipe has more
barnacles than you do.
What are
you doing?
I told you, brush it off to
your left. Your other left.
Hey, I thought you're
supposed to be off duty.
Well, good morning.
Till noon this is
on my own time.
Hey, Chief!
Yeah?
We got a gold-plater
in the main channel.
A big cruiser.
Whereabouts?
Off the point.
No running lights.
Just a diver's flag.
Want me to
run out there?
Yeah, would you? I can't
run this damn thing anyway.
Happy to do it.
Okay, I'll see you
back at the office.
And take the old man
of the sea with you.
All right,
cast off the bowline.
And then cast
off the stern line.
And then cast off
the spring line.
Let's go!
Look, we're only gonna
be here for a few minutes
and then we're goin' out.
Can't I come
with you?
No.
Please.
He can come
with me if he wants.
Yea!
No. No yea. Boo.
Off the boat, brat.
Ah, he can help me
at least then. Come on.
Boo. Big brothers.
Hey, Sean, you ever
been an anchor before?
Come on. Whoa.
Hey, Mike, hi.
Going out right away?
No.
Good. I want you
to meet my cousin.
Look, don't worry.
I'll meet her, I'll meet her.
'Kay, Tom, see you later.
Same time Thursday.
Hey, Andy,
over here.
See you guys later.
What do we got?
What's the problem?
Uh, what isn't?
Brooke!
Brooke!
Jackie, hi!
Quick, quick,
quick, who's that?
I think I'm in love.
I hope that's the cousin.
Lucky, lucky,
lucky, lucky.
Timmy, did you see the way
she was looking at you?
She wants you, man.
Nah, she wasn't
lookin' at me.
What are you saying? She was
staring at you and drooling.
No. I'm thin.
I wear glasses.
I live in Amity Island
year-round.
I'm not good
enough for her.
I guess you're right.
Probably wasn't looking at you.
Ooh. Larry, look.
Larry, look!
What?
Look at her!
You look great.
Thanks.
Well?
She's got tits
like a sparrow.
Do you have to
talk like that?
What are you, my mother?
Will you undo the jib?
We're all
going sailing.
Sailing?
Come on. I want you
to meet this guy.
He's so cute.
Okay.
Hey, look, I'm walking!
Leave him alone. He's tanning
the soles of his feet.
Mike, over here!
Douglas?
I can't watch
the news anymore.
I can't watch
a ball game anymore.
I can't even watch a movie!
All I hear is that damn kid
and his damn radio going,
"Breaker, breaker, breaker!"
Well, listen,
I'll do what I can.
But remember it's under
federal jurisdiction.
Well, call the FBI!
Brody, can I talk
to you for a minute?
One at a time.
Now you two, talk to Miss
Polly and you come with me.
Now what's this
about Grace Kinney?
Her bedroom window faces
my oldest boy's bedroom,
and she's teasing him.
She's dancing, dancing
around in a towel!
Dancing, huh?
Oh, Hendricks, good.
Right this way.
Excuse us, please.
I want you to come in here
and, uh, check out this 908.
What the hell's a 908?
I never heard of a 908.
get me out of there.
What's that?
Diver's camera.
Tom Andrews brought it up from
under the abandoned cruiser.
Oh, the abandoned cruiser?
A couple of rich guys.
Home is Newport, Rhode Island.
Well, if I had
$ 1 00,000 boat,
I wouldn't leave it
in the channel.
If you had $ 1 00,000 boat,
there'd be an investigation.
Very funny.
Grace Kinney is driving
my boy to distraction.
Dancing. You wanna
check out this dance for me?
Dance?
Wanna go back up?
Now back up, Mike!
Mike, you're twisted.
Pull up, Mike.
Pull up.
Easy, Mike.
Drop him down now.
You okay there?
You okay?
Get down, Mike.
Go back up.
The weather continues
to be warm and clear.
And now back to the music
from Plymouth,
the rock of New England.
Wait. Take a break
for a minute, okay?
Hey, Tina,
where are you going?
Hey!
Eddie, come on.
What's up?
- Let's go skiing.
- What?
Come on. We can
use my uncle's boat.
Let's do it next week,
all right?
God, with you,
everything is next week.
Terry?
Terry?
Terry!
Aaah!
Aaah! Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaah! Aaah!
Wow!
God!
I can't find anyone out here.
They must've gone to the bottom
or drifted with the tide.
Well, I've got
witnesses that say...
there was one person in the boat
and one person water-skiing.
Told ya,
nothin' here.
Well, then I want you
to try dragging.
For how long? Current's
moving everything around and
it's gonna be dark pretty soon.
I don't care. I want you to
stay on it as long as it takes.
We heard this noise
like a boom.
And when we looked,
there was this cloud of smoke.
That was the explosion.
One minute they were having
a wonderful time, and the next--
You've no idea what
could've caused this?
I don't know what
could've done that.
Were they
off-islanders?
I don't know.
Can we go now?
Chief?
Chief Brody,
c-can we go, please?
Yes.
Thank you, Tina.
We've been over this
a dozen times.
I know, I know!
How much longer?
Until we
find something.
I'm cold, bored.
You're bored?
Holy shit!
Jesus, this is heavy!
Aw, shit. Drop it.
Well, what is it?
Drop it.
It's a power line.
- Oh, terrific.
- Let me untangle it.
We don't want a power
blackout on the island.
Let's get out of here
before we do find something.
That's your third
smoke already.
Good coffee.
Try a donut.
I want
Fruit Loops.
Eat Cheerios.
You eat Cheerios.
I want Fruit Loops.
You eat Cheerios.
What are you guys
up to today?
I don't know about him,
but I'm goin' sailin'.
Again?
What else is
there to do?
How 'bout that job you
were supposed to get?
Do I have to?
He doesn't really have to.
I mean, this is his vacation.
I wonder where I
left my date book?
Good morning.
Everybody up early today?
Something going on
I should know about?
Lots.
Look,
this kid is 1 7.
We've talked about him
getting a job before.
I know, you're right.
I wish you could spend
some time with him,
take a half-day off.
How can I? I'm in the
middle of a boat accident.
I've only got three regular
cops and a secretary.
And a deputy who's fallen
in love with the police launch.
And here's another one.
What is it about this place?
Everybody's a boat freak.
It's an island.
I'm goin'.
Hold it.
Wait a minute.
I don't want you to go out
too far if it gets rough.
We've had a lot of
trouble out there.
Okay. I'll see you later.
I mean, be careful.
I'll be careful.
I'll be careful.
Tina, come back here.
No.
Come on.
Give me my hat.
Double nope.
Come on, Tina.
I wonder why they
decided to move?
Too hot in the lighthouse.
Too hot for those two?
I can't believe it.
Aaah!
Ugh.
I called you as soon
as I heard about this...
because I hear the bites
are big, really big.
Well, after we've looked,
we'll talk.
All right.
Here it is. Could you
move back, please?
Could we have a little air?
That's right, move back.
Please, just move back.
Thanks.
Jesus.
What do you think?
First things first.
Tip of the snout,
please.
Length, seven and
a half meters.
Seven and
a half meters.
Correct.
You better check
the bite radius.
The what?
The shape
of the mouth.
Whale's mouth?
Shark's mouth.
What shark?
The shark
that did this.
We don't
know that, do we.
That's what we're
here to find out.
And we will.
- I can't hear you if
you're going to whisper.
- 1 1 1 centimeters.
I have had some
experience with sharks.
Oh, have you?
Yeah.
And I think a--
I think a great white
might've done this.
Carcharodon carcharias?
Right.
What makes you think there
might be one in these waters?
Well, it's obvious
that, uh--
That a big fish took
a bite out of this big fish.
This is a mammal,
not a fish.
Don't quibble with me.
Is it a shark bite or isn't it?
Possibly.
Then again, this is
a killer whale.
It would have to be a shark
of considerable size.
Look, we know that, that sharks
are attracted by blood.
And thrashing about.
And sound.
Sound?
Sound like sonar, radar.
They hone in on unusual sounds,
irregular sounds,
almost any rhythmic
low-frequency vibration.
That means that there
could be one around.
Not necessarily.
These wounds could have
been inflicted 1 5 miles
out to sea or more.
None of them were
immediately fatal.
Currents could have carried
the body ten miles further.
We got a hell of
a tide this month.
Will you just take care
of the crowd, please?
Dad?
Mr. Hendricks, will you
take this down, please?
No more sailing today, okay?
And I'd like you to
come back with me.
We came out in my boat.
Yeah, but Andy
will take it back.
I got a date.
She'll understand.
No, she won't.
Mike, for Christ's sakes,
give me a break here, will ya?
...tissue attacks.
It's either a great white
or another killer whale.
Well, I'd like
to know which.
Well, it's impossible for me to
tell when the body's like this.
This animal has been ashore
for 1 0 or 1 2 hours and
drifting for a day at least.
Every little nibbler
in the sea's taken a bite.
I know that
dolphins communicate.
I mean, they send signals.
You don't think that
if a shark was destroyed,
that another shark could,
could come and--
Sharks don't take things
personally, Mr. Brody.
Dad, can I
please have my--
No.
Hey, look, don't worry about it.
I'll take it back and tie it up.
Bye, Mike.
See you later.
I'm sorry. Bye.
It'll be okay, Mike. I'll see
you tomorrow, all right?
I appreciate it.
Thanks.
Larry. Larry,
wait a minute.
I'm showing summer rentals.
I think we have a hell of
a good season going for us.
That's swell, Larry, but I
have to talk to you alone.
We're alone.
I think we may have
another shark problem.
Are you serious?
You bet I'm serious.
I've got a half-eaten
whale on the beach.
I've got two
persons missing.
This whale has got a bite
out of it about this big.
Martin, no one has seen
a shark. Be realistic.
I think the selectmen
should know about it.
I know it's just a feeling,
but you've got to understand.
Larry, for Christ sakes,
I not only have this attack,
but I've got, I've got
two water-skiers--
A tragedy,
but a boating accident.
No fin, no sharks.
Nothing but
a boating accident.
Their boat's still missing.
We have a lot of deaths in
these waters that never turn up.
Are they all
shark victims?
Maybe they are.
- Oh, bullshit.
- Bullshit?
Is it bullshit, I got
a whale on the beach
with a bite in it this big?
What am I, an ass?
When you called me,
I called Elkins and her bosses.
Nothing she saw
is proof of anything.
So that means we're not
gonna do anything, huh?
Martin,
don't press it this time.
Well, I've got to
get back to work.
Okay.
Okay, Larry, but you just
remember this conversation.
You just
remember it!
Aaah!
Chief?
Yeah?
Chief?
Hi. Missed you
at the funeral home.
Santos said
you'd be here.
Yeah. Christ,
what a mess.
You didn't miss much.
Positive I.D.?
Well, we're pretty sure
it was the woman aboard
the boat all right.
Yeah?
Thank you, Operator.
Just keep trying.
Anything new on
those two divers?
Nothin'.
I think we oughta keep
sightseers away from there.
Did you take a look at
that stuff in that box?
No.
How 'bout that camera?
There might be something in it.
Yeah, right.
Why don't you take it over to
Fogarty's and get it developed.
I'll do it first thing
in the morning.
Why not now?
It's too late.
Christ, I'm late
for dinner.
Listen, I'm expecting
a long-distance call.
When it comes through,
have them send it over
to the house, all right?
Okay, Chief.
Yes. Yes,
I can hear you.
Yes, I will. I'll give him
the message.
- Thank you.
- That for me?
Hi, Dad.
Hi, Dad.
Hi, gang.
It was sort of.
Uh, Matt Hooper.
He's on the research vessel
Aurora, presently in the
Antarctic Ocean,
and he won't be in radio
range till next spring.
Yeah, I gave him a call.
Martin?
Martin?
Yeah?
You're a mess.
Where were you?
I had to go to Santos'.
I dragged a body out
of the ocean today.
Do you have any idea
what happened?
No, we don't know.
Santos seems to think it
might be one of the victims
from that boat accident.
Do you want to
talk about it?
Just routine.
Okay.
Hey, Mike,
come here a minute.
Yeah, what is it?
I got something for you
to do tomorrow.
Well, I kinda had plans.
Sailing? Forget it.
You're grounded,
beached, that's it.
Come on, Dad.
I talked to Upjohn
down at the beach.
He's got a job that's gonna
last till you go back to school.
That's all summer.
I know it's all of summer,
but he wanted a job.
Now he's got one.
I want that boat
out of the water
by tomorrow night.
Dad, please--
By tomorrow night.
And I mean it!
Now,
everybody here?
Just about.
Okay. Terrific.
Now, folks, this is
the town beach.
Now, the development
naturally has its...
own private access, but what
I wanted you to really see...
was the concession area,
and take a look at the sand.
It's like sugar.
It's beautiful.
It really is.
In the summertime,
when the sun sets,
it goes right down there, and
the whole beach looks incredible.
It really is. It can be
absolutely breathtaking.
I think you'll find this little
bandstand very interesting.
We take quite a bit
of pride in this.
It was built in about, uh,
oh, I think it was 1 9 1 7.
Hello. Selling some more
of the good life?
Oh, yeah. Piece o' this,
piece o' that. It all adds up.
Your husband's been here
all morning. What's he doing?
His job.
Dad got you
working, huh?
Yeah.
I'm helping.
Good.
Do you happen to know
where your dad is?
He's up there.
Oh, for Christ sake.
Well, if you have any questions,
any questions at all...
about recreational
possibilities,
our lovely Ellen Brody
here will be only too
happy to answer them.
- Len, can I speak to you?
- Sure. Excuse me a moment.
Okay, anybody have
any questions?
Larry, I think we've got
a couple of live ones.
Brody's riding
his tower.
Oh, shit.
Let's go faster!
You got it, sweetheart.
Come on!
This fast
enough for you?
No, faster!
Faster?
Faster!
Hey, look,
there's my dad.
Wave to my son.
Good.
How the hell do we get
him down from there?
Well, maybe
nobody noticed.
Let's get them all
back in the van, huh?
Yeah, come on.
Renee wants to know, what's
that man doing way up there?
What man?
Oh, he's watching.
You know, a lookout.
For what?
It's a shark tower.
I saw one in Florida.
He's looking
for sharks.
Excuse me, dear, it's
an observation platform.
That's our chief of police.
He's just checking it.
That's right. See, normally,
it's used for bird-watching.
You know,
weather measurements...
and nature observation,
that sort of thing.
Ellen-- Excuse me. Ellen,
we're running a little late.
Ellen.
Well, if we can all
get back on the bus,
maybe we can show
you the country club.
Right.
Out of the water!
Out of the water now!
Everybody, out!
Get out!
Get out of there!
Get out!
Out of the water!
What the hell is
that idiot doing?
Everybody, out!
Get out of there!
Get out!
Everyone, out!
Out of the water!
Get out of there!
Get out!
Get out of
the water!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
It's just bluefish!
Bluefish, geez!
It's a school
of bluefish!
It's just bluefish!
Martin!
Ellen, Ellen, Ellen,
it's all right.
Let's not make
it worse. Come on.
Folks, it's all over.
Come on. Let's get
back to the truck.
Let's break it up.
It's okay.
It's just--
It's false alarm.
It's all right.
Go back.
Oh, my God.
Come on. Let's go. It's over.
Break it up. Come on.
Polly, no calls now, huh?
Fogarty?
Okay, put him on.
Yeah, Phil?
What pictures?
You're kidding.
I'll be right over.
That's the Orca.
Good lens, too.
Fast. 1-4, I think.
You notice that
diffusion over there?
Don't jerk me around.
What else have you got?
Over here.
I exposed another bunch
this morning, but I haven't
had a chance to develop them.
That's it.
That's the one.
Well, speak of
the devil.
Martin, this is kind
of an official meeting.
Oh, good.
I'm glad you're all here.
I've got something to show you.
Look at this.
Fogarty just developed it.
It came out of that camera
from the missing divers.
Seaweed?
I don't know.
What is it?
It's underwater, isn't it?
That's why it's so dark.
It's nothing
I can see.
What are you
talking about?
Look at this.
That's a shark.
Look at the outline.
Look at the mouth, the eyes.
Is that
what it is?
Sorry, I just don't see it.
Neither do I.
It's nothing.
Martin, it could
be anything.
Wait a minute. Are you people
telling me I don't know what
a shark looks like?
Brody, this is nothing.
Seaweed, mud, something in the lens.
- Lens, my ass!
- You're damn right
it's your ass!
Now be reasonable,
please.
Reasonable, with him?
Goddamn it, will you
listen to the man?
Will you just listen to him?
"Be reasonable."
Look, Brody, you started
a panic on a public beach.
You shot up the damn place.
God knows who you
could've injured.
What if somebody decides
to sue us? Did you ever
stop to think about that?
It could ruin us.
You don't have to worry about
being sued or being ruined,
if this turns out to
be what I think it is,
because there won't
be anybody here.
Now, Martin,
let's not--
Let's not what,
Larry? What?
Larry, come on.
Let's just forget it.
He won't listen.
It's obvious the man
has made up his mind.
You bet your life
I've made up my mind.
But I'm telling you and
I'm telling everybody at
this table that that's a shark.
I know what a shark looks like.
I've seen one up close.
And you better do
something about this one,
because I don't intend to
go through that hell again.
Martin,
could you wait
here for a minute?
For what?
Please, just
have a seat...
while we look at the picture
and make up our own minds.
All right.
I'll have a seat...
for what it's worth.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, please.
Yeah, I got it!
Hey, Mike.
I saw your dad over
at the town hall.
I know.
Did he really freak out
on the town beach?
I don't know.
Hey, don't worry about them.
It's all bullshit anyway.
Hey, Ellen,
you know,
this is the only dump in town
where the garbageman delivers.
Ha... ha... ha.
Hey, anybody want to
go to the lighthouse?
Now, at night?
Tomorrow, maybe spend the day.
My dad left a couple of cases
of beer in the garage.
Is it still there?
Well, it's kind of
vacationing on my boat.
Hey, Mike,
you gonna go?
Yeah, why not?
'Cause you might be painting
toilets at the beach.
Very funny.
Hey, are we gonna
have a picnic?
Yeah. You bring the food.
Mike?
Hi.
I'd like to go
to the lighthouse with you.
Well, I'm not
sure I can go.
I'm beached.
I'm grounded.
My dad won't let me
take my boat out.
Do you always do what
your parents tell you to?
No.
Good. Then I'll be
at the dock at 8:00.
Eight o'clock,
everybody.
I don't know
what I'd do.
Hey, what is this,
a wake for a funeral?
You surprised us.
Chief, I walked over
as soon as I heard about it.
They only fired me.
They didn't bury me.
Hello, baby,
I'm home.
I know.
I know you know.
Listen, I got
something for ya.
This is gonna look better
on you than on me,
because you're
a snappier dresser.
Oh, hey, you're drinkin'
the good stuff.
How 'bout a toast?
A toast to the new chief.
Yeah.
Come on, Ellen,
the chief is gonna need
all the luck he can get.
No? Okay.
We'll do it together.
Toast to
the new chief.
Hail to the chief.
# Dum-dum da-dum
da-dum da-dum da-dum #
# Dum-dum da-dum-- #
Come on. Drink, for Christ sakes.
It's a milestone in your career.
Ease up, Martin.
Look, Chief, not only
don't I want your job,
but I came over to tell you that
I think you're the greatest.
And I--
Oh,Jeff,
it's okay.
Come on. It's not
your fault. I know that.
Well, I gotta
go anyway.
Thank you for coming by, Jeff.
You've really been a big help.
Thank you.
Good night,Jeff.
Good night.
Poor Hendricks.
They'll fire
his ass too.
You'll see.
Showed 'em
a picture of that shark.
They didn't see it.
They see only
what they wanna see.
But it's out there, all right.
It's a big mother too.
Is that why they fired you?
It wasn't just that.
Well, what was it?
The scene at the beach? I was
there, I saw what happened.
Oh, I blew it.
I blew it.
I shot off my mouth,
I shot off my gun.
Four years
down the drain.
Shot to hell.
What a dummy.
What else?
What else?
I never been
fired before.
You know that?
I mean, once when I was 1 7,
when I was a kid,
yeah, but...
never from a real job.
Nobody ever told me
I couldn't hack it.
They're not
saying that.
Yes, they are.
They are.
Maybe they're right.
I'm tired.
Tired.
I'm too damn tired.
Too damn drunk.
That's what you are.
Too damn drunk.
Are you going out?
Yeah.
Are you going sailing?
Maybe.
Take me!
No!
- I wanna go with you.
- Shh, quiet.
Michael!
All right,
come on.
But be quiet.
Hello, Denise,
love of my life.
If you're grounded,
what are we doin' this for?
Practice?
Yeah, practice.
Why are we here?
Why don't we go to the beach?
We can putz around.
We can make some money,
pick up some girls.
Hey, look.
If you're gonna get
in the way, go home.
I'm not in the way.
Andy, am I
in the way?
You're always in the way.
Is this guy
causing you trouble?
Put me down!
Come on. You can
go out in my boat.
You want him?
You can have him.
I think you just made
somebody very happy.
Hi, Mike,
you goin' out?
Hi, guys.
Yeah.
I thought you were grounded.
I can go out
if I want to.
You can?
Is there enough room
for all of us on the boat?
I don't know.
We're overcrowded--
We got plenty of room.
Come on aboard.
I guess so.
Brooke?
I got room.
Great.
You'll go with me?
Sure.
Thanks, guys,
but I'm going with Timmy.
Come on.
Fantastic.
We're gonna sink.
Don't worry about it,
all right?
Come on.
I'm ready.
Hey, I thought you said
she was comin' with us.
Obviously, she's not.
You want to talk about it?
You want to swim home?
Hey, Tom!
Hey, Nicholas!
You're supposed to be in class!
You dive for me.
I've got company.
I'm going for lobster!
Great!
Bring me one!
I want mine with butter!
You got that, Tom?
So long, turkeys!
Okay, Sparky's gonna
take you down today.
If everybody's ready,
let's buddy up and drop.
Give him some space.
Get the regulator.
Get us in!
For Christ sake, get us in!
Let's get him in
and keep him warm.
Okay, we'll put him
in forward cabin.
Take it easy.
He'll be okay.
Okay, prepare the bowline.
Let's go!
Thank you.
So?
So I'll go down to the office,
clean out the desk,
turn in the truck...
and maybe I'll get shitfaced
and rap your boss
right in the mouth.
I think
I'd better give notice.
Take it easy.
We may need
the income.
Mike's gone.
He's breaking out
early these days.
Must be a morning man.
Like his father.
Good morning.
Hi.
Anything special today?
No. Sean must be out
playing somewhere.
Why don't you let him
have whatever he wants.
Okay.
Just keep him away
from the candy.
Okay.
Am I still gonna
get my ride?
Mmm.
Better call your brother,
the plumber. That sink
is still screwed up.
Frankie? He's my cousin.
Ask him if he can
use an apprentice.
Have a nice day.
Do you want to just leave
her pointed up like this?
Hold on a minute.
There we go.
Yeah, this is fine.
And what about sailing?
What about it?
Look, don't you worry.
We're gonna make it.
We're gonna
make it to Budapest
if you're not careful.
What about
the others?
What about 'em?
Look, I know the others
will be there when
we get there.
They'll have their bonfire
and blankets, clams, liquor.
Yeah?
Yeah, I suppose.
And what are we gonna do
in the meantime?
Well, in the meantime,
we're gonna have to
think of something.
Wait a minute.
What?
Get out the blankets.
I got
black-and-blue marks
all over my butt.
My mom's starting
to get uptight about 'em.
Okay.
Out with the blanket.
You really need
a blanket, huh?
I don't need a blanket.
Hey, I can't
come up with a--
But we could do
something else.
Well!
Here's your blanket.
Ooo!
Eddie! Help!
Eddie!
Tina!
Eddie, help me!
Tina!
Ed!
Jesus.
Eddie, swim! Swim fast!
There's a shark, Eddie!
Swim!
Oh, God, Eddie!
Swim!
Swim faster!
Hurry!
Come on! Swim!
Come on! Swim!
Hurry, Eddie, it's a shark!
Eddie, hurry, faster!
Come on! Swim!
Hurry!
Hurry! Eddie!
Eddie?
Eddie, no.
Tina! Tina! Help me!
Oh, Mommy.
Please, make it go away.
Make it go away.
Make it go away.
Honey, it's not
your job anymore.
I know. I just
want to take a look.
Come on. Get outta there.
Come on!
What happened to him?
Embolism.
Air bubbles in the blood.
He came up too fast, Chief.
He held his damn breath.
Something must have
scared him down there.
He just panicked.
Don't worry, we're takin'
good care of him. Come on.
Easy!
How did this happen?
Bite reflex, like a spasm.
Happened about an hour ago,
right after the kids went out.
What kids?
Oh, Junior Vaughn,
Brooke Peters,
Jackie, Mike--
Our Mike?
Yeah, they said they were
headed for the lighthouse.
Hey! Where you goin'?
Look, Chief!
You're not chief anymore.
I can't let you take her out.
Mrs. Brody, look, if he
can't go, then you can't go.
Neither one of you can go.
Chief, please!
Ellen, get that line.
- Mike is out there!
- But I signed for the boat!
Mrs. Brody, please!
Aww, shit!
Chief, go on up to the bow.
You're doing that wrong.
Go ahead,
untie the bowline.
What the hell? They can't
fire both of us, right?
Somebody's
got to be in charge.
All right, which direction
you want to go?
You said something
about a lighthouse!
Let's go!
All right!
Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol.
Over.
This is Harbor Patrol.
Yeah, listen, Ed.
Do you think you can
raise me a chopper?
Is that you, Brody?
Not right away.
He's down checking a buoy
in the channel.
I want you to get the chopper
out to the lighthouse.
There's kids day sailing there.
I want them
brought back to port.
Affirmative, turn the kids
day sailing back to port.
I heard ya.
Patrol out.
Brody out.
Hurry up, suckers,
you're draggin'.
Yeah, come on.
We're gonna lose ya.
Get that piece of junk
out of the way, huh?
Hey, let's go past
the lighthouse.
I know a better spot.
Come about!
You got it!
I got it, Chief.
It's all right.
Come on. Come on.
It's okay.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Nooo!
Take it easy.
You're all right.
You're all right.
Ellen.
No, no, no.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Tina, oh, Tina.
It's still there.
Tina, Tina,
it's okay.
It's still there.
What's the matter?
What's still there?
What's still there?
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shark!
It's still there.
Over there.
That boat's
gonna take you in.
Where the hell are they?
About ten degrees
off your starboard bow.
Take a heading leeward
of Sand Island--
Don't give me that shit, point!
- There!
- All right, I got it.
Mr. Christian,
Mr. Christian.
Pump up this boat. Shave off
that dreadful moustache.
England expects every man
to do his duty. You may
fire when ready, Quigley.
Damn the torpedoes!
Full speed ahead.
This will be
our finest hour!
Oh, shit.
Hey, Bligh, someone
pop your balloon?
It's no problem.
No problem.
Come on!
Balance the boat.
All right! All right!
It's all right!
Watch it!
Marge!
Kevin, do something!
Sean!
Oh, no!
Timmy! Brooke!
Hey, you guys!
Timmy! Swim!
Where is it?
I don't know!
Larry, get me outta here!
I'm gonna get you outta here!
Don't worry!
Larry! Turn!
Turn!
Goddamn!
Shit!
It's okay.
Get outta the water.
Will you hurry up?
Mike's out there!
Hurry up!
Out of the water!
Somebody,
look out for Mike!
Hang on to something!
Mike!
Get outta there!
Hold on!
Oh, my God!
Mike! Mike!
Brody!
Come on.
That's it.
Okay! Get his arms!
Come on!
Get ahold of his jacket!
Get his jacket!
Get him clear.
It's coming up!
Get him up!
Get his leg!
Timmy!
Go! Get him up!
Come on! Come on!
Hold him!
He's bleeding
pretty bad.
We gotta get Mike
to a doctor!
- Can you sail?
- Yeah, we'll take him in.
Go for it, and get some
help out here fast!
Let's go!
Okay, let's raft
this mess up.
Throw this--
Throw it to Brooke.
Brooke!
Get this and
throw it to Marge!
Marge, here!
Take it!
Tie a bowline
around your mast.
Wrap it around.
Easy.
Let me help you.
I don't know
if it's gonna hold.
All right,
somebody put a fender up.
We could use
another hand on this.
Take it easy. Just pull.
Tie it on. All right.
Amity Launch
to Air Patrol One.
Amity Launch
to Air Patrol One.
Do you read me?
This is Air Patrol.
Is that you, Brody?
Yeah, listen, do you
have a fix on those kids yet?
Negative,
I'm still down.
You better get the hell up
because I'm out here all alone.
Brody, I gotta switch frequencies.
Call my boss. I'll meet you over
by Francis Shoal.
Harbor Air out.
Francis Shoal? Where
the hell is Francis Shoal?
Shit.
I'm all alone out here.
Anybody want
to play charades?
No.
Listen, all we have to do
is land at Cable Junction
and wait.
Yeah, and how are we
gonna do that floating
on this garbage?
What's after Cable Junction?
The Atlantic.
Then Ireland.
God, I'm hungry.
Air Patrol to base.
I have a positive location
on that sailing party.
Disabled and adrift.
About three quarters of
a mile west of Cable Junction.
Wind and tide carrying
them about due east.
Is everybody all right?
Is anybody hurt?
Now, listen, I'm gonna give you
a tow to Cable Junction.
Then I'm gonna call
the Coast Guard
to send a cutter.
Throw me a line.
Take it easy.
Here we go. All right.
Oh, what a day.
Here you go!
Okay!
Now hold on
to something.
Okay.
Just hurry up!
Better hang on.
- Bob!
- Marge!
Sean!
Oooooh!
- Sean!
- Sean!
Sean! Sean!
Get him up
on the boat!
Sean!
Come on!
Hurry!
Get him up on the boat!
Come on! Come on!
Will you pull me?
I can't get up!
Nooooo!
Take her to the hospital.
Meet me back at the office
on the double.
You gotta try to
understand my position.
Tina's gonna be all right.
Are you okay?
Ellen, I'm sorry.
Believe me, I'm sorry.
I was only thinking of
everyone's interest--
I don't give a damn.
All I know is a boy
is dead and my son and
husband are still out there.
Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol.
Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol.
Amity Launch to Harb--
Damn!
Damn it!
Sean, catch the rope!
Sean, goddamn it!
Sean!
Try and
catch the rope!
Sean! The rope!
Come on, Sean!
Come on, kid!
Sean! Catch the rope!
The rope, Sean!
Come on!
Come on, Sean!
Come on. He's got to help,
or it's not going to work.
Will you stop!
Come on, Sean!
Wake up!
Look at us!
Sean!
Sean, goddamn it!
Goddamn it, Sean!
You listen to me,
or I'll break your ass,
do you hear?
Okay, come on!
Come on!
Okay, okay,
Sean, listen.
Listen, we're gonna throw
you this rope, and you
damn well better catch it!
Okay, Sean,
you ready?
Here it comes, kid!
Get it, Sean!
Sean, get it!
Sean, come it!
Get it!
Okay, good.
Tie it around the centerboard.
Tie it tight!
Okay, you ready?
Hold on!
Hang on, okay?
Here we go!
Hold on tight.
Come on.
Okay, kid?
Take it easy.
Come on. Okay!
- Oh, my God!
-Jesus! Get him out!
- Come on, come on!
- Get him on the boat!
Oh, God!
Are you okay, kid?
I thought we lost you.
It's all right. I got you.
Cable Junction's ahead.
Can we make it?
I don't know!
Hey, I was just asking.
I don't know.
How's she doing?
Just gotta
keep her warm.
Somebody give me a hand.
We might be able to steer
this thing.
What the hell
are you guys playing
with the tiller for?
At 7:46
when this tide--
Hey, shut up!
I'm sorry, Larry, I can't
stop thinking about this.
Well, you better try!
Hey, come on!
Oh, God, please help us!
Jesus, Holy Mary.
Mother of Christ.
Please, help us.
Please, help us.
We're begging.
Please, save us.
Jesus.
Jesus,Jesus, please.
Oh, thank Christ.
Here, take that
back there to the cleat.
What happened?
I'm okay.
You sure?
A shark hit us.
Sean's out there.
What?
He wanted to come.
It's okay, wasn't it?
Where are they?
They're in the current,
drifting towards
Cable Junction.
All right, you three
get to the lighthouse
and stay there.
Stay there!
I'm sorry, Dad.
I didn't know.
It's all right. Forget it.
Just get to the lighthouse!
We're almost there.
I don't think
it's gonna work.
Come on, Patrick,
more to port.
We're gonna make it.
Keep turning.
We've got to land on it.
More to port,
goddamn it!
It's all
the way over.
Shit.
Larry, are we going to
make it to the island?
We're steering for it,
kid.
Yeah, but the
wind drift is lateral.
- What does that mean?
- We're going sideways.
For every yard
we go that way,
we go that way a yard.
Yeah, but we were
heading right for it.
We don't have it anymore.
Shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
No, wait, wait,
stop paddling.
What about the island?
The shark!
What's happening?
I don't know,
I think we're stuck.
I think it's just
the bottom.
Yeah.
It's that thing!
No, no, it's the bottom.
No, it's not the bottom.
It's that thing.
It's gonna kill us!
It's gonna kill us now!
-Jackie, shut up!
- No, it's gonna kill us!
Shut up!
Larry!
Leave her alone!
Then you
take care of her!
Larry, she's hysterical.
Beating her head in--
Sit down!
Knock it off, Larry!
Be quiet!
-
- Shut up!
- Listen!
- She shouldn't freak out!
Listen!
You hear it?
Over there!
It's coming towards us!
It's Dad!
It's Dad!
Good. I'm getting
off of here. Good.
Home!
We're goin' home!
Pull yourselves over.
Gonna get the hell outta here.
We can't.
We're stuck on the bottom.
I'll get you closer.
You'll come aboard.
Just move alongside.
Please hurry!
All right,
hold it steady.
-
- Oh, sh--!
-
-
Wait! No! Wait!
Dad!
I'm all right.
Hold on!
All right, take this!
I'll try and
get you over.
All right, tie it on!
Okay!
All right, pull these hooks
over with the rope.
Secure them to the raft.
I'll pull you back with
the wench, got it?
Okay!
All right,
now pull it over.
It's stuck!
Wait a minute.
I'll put it in reverse.
L-L-Lucy!
Lucy, look out!
Oh, my God!
No!
No!
Lucy! Hold on!
No!
Lucy!
No! Oh, my God! No!
Dad! Dad!
Hold on!

Dad!
Get away! No!
Oh, my God!

Da-a-a-a-a-d!
Da-a-a-a-d!
- Where'd he go?
- Where is he?
Oh.

Watch out!

Come on!
I got somethin' for ya now!
Chief! Chief!
That's it! Attaboy!
Come on!
Right over here!
Dad!
That's it! Come on!

Open wide!

Did you see it? He did it!
Did he get it?
It's dead?
It's dead!
Ha-ha-ha!
Oh, thank you,

Thank you, thank you,

And you!
They made me
go with them.
Sure, they did.
