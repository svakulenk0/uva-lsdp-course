- What can I get for you?
- Just a burger and a drink, please.
How do you want that burger done?
It doesn't matter.
Okay, that'll be 4 bucks.
- You want that for here?
- No.
Okay, we'll bring that right out to you.
Mommy, why does that girI's face
look like that?
You eat your food, honey.
- Did she get into an accident?
- Yes. Eat your food.
Stop looking at me! Stop looking at me!
I know what I look like.
You think I chose to look like this?
You think I chose this?
The Han dynasty, during their rule,
would sometimes leave their enemies alive,
disfiguring them
in a most grotesque manner.
It was a message to all those
who would oppose their rule
that you would die,
or carry the scars of your defiance.
They understood the psychologicaI effect
this would have on the masses.
There was a price to pay for your actions.
By the time they were through with you,
death would be a welcome friend.
Have your daddy pick me up a slushy
when he gets off work, okay?
Make it a cherry one.
Bradley, I've told you a million times,
leave Ravi alone and find another seat.
Well, as I entered the classroom,
this was the only seat available.
Then switch with Bernard.
Continuing on, talking about the
importance of the Chinese ancient mindset
that they were into this whole idea
of cosmic retribution.
I got us the hottest costumes for the party.
They scream,
"We love sex, but not with you. "
- We're so vain.
- I'm totally okay with that.
- So, who's throwing this party anyways?
- Probably Stephanie.
She keeps trying to win us over
so that we'll be her friend.
She's such a loser.
Awesome, so we'll drink her booze,
trash her place and still ignore her ass.
You realize
we're all going to hell someday, right?
And we'll be the hottest bitches there, too.
That's the plan.
Oh, my God.
There's that little bitch, Emily.
Let's fuck with her.
Hey, sexy girI.
- So, going to the costume party next week?
- No.
Come on, it'll be so much fun.
Maybe you can even
get your cherry popped.
- Yeah, some guys like freaks.
- Yeah, Emily, don't you want to have fun?
- I wasn't invited.
- What?
You mean,
we were invited and you were not?
I don't understand. I mean, look at you.
How could that be?
Why are you always so mean to me?
I've never done anything to you.
We're not being mean. We're being honest.
You know, I think you'd actually like me
if you just gave me a chance.
I doubt it.
Oh, my God, you're not gonna cry, are you?
- Oh, my God.
- Don't go. Be our friend.
Howdy.
Hey, is Workley around?
Passed away about eight months ago.
I'm his nephew.
He left me the house in his will.
Well, I'm sorry for your loss, son.
My name's Parker.
- I'm Dane.
- Dane. Nice to meet you.
Eight months. Don't that beat all?
You know, he and I were both in Vietnam.
We shared a lot of stories.
So, you and your friends doing some work
around the grounds?
Yeah.
Yeah, just getting the place ready.
It's a mighty fine picking.
Well, if you need anything,
I'm just a mile or so down here.
Thanks. Appreciate it.
You know,
I don't mean to stick my nose in it,
but that plan of yours,
it's never gonna work.
- Sorry?
- Trap.
The tops are too sturdy.
They'll walk right over it.
What you need are cage traps.
I got plenty of them.
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe. Thanks.
Just offering.
Hey, Ravi.
Yeah, I'm watching it now.
I think it's...
Gruesome, disgusting.
It's perfect.
We'll pick up the partiers in the truck
and bring them to the house.
Triplets will be on ATVs in the woods
wearing the same costumes as us.
- Nobody escapes.
- I think it's brilliant.
I mean,
all the years of watching horror films,
what can be better than
to put it all to use?
I think I know the perfect way
to use Jack's banjo skills.
Dude, what? Can you smell it?
Can you smell it?
You're killing me.
- Dude.
- He's fucking coming over here, man.
- Dude.
- Trying to come over here?
Go back to India, bitch.
Bernard, I believe this is yours.
Thank you, come again.
- Sorry.
- Go back to your seat.
We have no hummus here for you.
Don't worry about it, man.
- Yo, my peoples, what's up?
- Hey, Kurtis.
Check it.
I just got my first commerciaI TV gig.
You're looking at the new face
of Yums shoes.
Video shoot over at their spot on Friday.
I want you guys to come check it out.
- That's great news.
- Hey, you never know.
Next time you guys see me,
I'll be at the Oscars
accepting my award for best actor.
Ravi, I remember you got that sweet camera
for your birthday.
Can I get you to, you know, shoot
some behind-the-scenes stuff for me?
- Help me out?
- Yeah, sure.
Nice. All right, so I'll see you guys there?
CooI. All right, y'all.
- I like Kurtis.
- Me, too.
- Make sure he doesn't make the party.
- Yeah.
He's not one of them.
- What's up, man?
- What's up?
What's up? Hey, look, I want you guys
to come out. I'm doing a video shoot.
Look.
Oh, my God.
I cannot wait untiI the party next week.
- What?
- You're fucking Tommy.
- Who told you that?
- It's in your cell phone, stupid.
"I can't wait to taste you again. "
You bitch. Give me that.
- That is so shitty.
- Take it easy.
We've been besties since grade schooI.
Can't believe you didn't tell us.
He made me promise not to tell anybody,
and you can't either.
You know, we have to keep it quiet
since he's still dating Nadya.
- I'm gonna go see him tonight.
- We're just playing. We won't tell.
Besides, Tommy's kind of hot.
I hate that Russian bitch anyways.
I'm glad you're fucking her man.
AII's fair in sex and high schooI.
"I find that I am quite content.
"I have peace in my life,
"and I am not afraid.
"For the first time, I am not afraid. "
Yeah, Mom?
What's with the boxes?
I noticed you packed up some things.
Just cleaning up a bit.
Is everything okay?
You've been very quiet lately.
- Yes, everything's fine.
- Okay.
"One night.
"One finaI night. "
I just... Look, I really appreciate
you guys coming, man. It means a lot.
- Anytime, man.
- Man.
Now, let me clean the lens off reaI quick.
- I'll be right back.
- All right.
You must be pretty nervous, huh?
A little bit. I'll find the courage, though.
Snap!
What do we have here, son, huh?
If it isn't the Slumdog Millionaire.
What's up, bin Laden?
- I'm Indian, not Arab.
- My bad. I'm sorry.
- No, it's a dot.
- Like it fucking even matters.
- What do you got there, sunshine, huh?
- Technology.
Give it. Give it.
Sunni's doing a little recon
for his terrorist cell. What you think?
- Joke's over.
- Joke's not over.
Just give it back.
- Looks like we got ourselves a terrorist.
- I caught me a terrorist, Bill.
- I got him. I got him.
- How'd you get him?
Well, he was looking
at my lockstock funny.
- You remember state?
- Fuck, yeah.
So close.
Bradley's at the 30! The 20!
- The 10!
- Go, go, go!
- Touchdown, Bradley.
- And the crowd goes wild.
- Why'd you do that?
- Easy, missy.
- 'Cause I felt like it.
- These things happen.
- Don't be so down.
- Ravi, they're starting.
- What's going on?
- Three peas in a pod.
- Just telling stories and hanging out.
- What happened to your camera?
- What happened?
- Did you guys break his camera?
- Is it busted? Did it bust?
- Hate to think, yeah.
- I remember.
- No, you...
Yeah, I did. I busted it.
The question is, what the fuck
are you gonna do about it, huh?
What the fuck are you gonna do about it?
I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what.
You kick my ass, I'll buy him a new camera.
How's that sound?
I can't beat you.
You can't beat me?
I know you can't beat me.
You know why?
'Cause you're a coward.
That's why.
You know why it is
that I do what I do to you?
Do you know? I do it because I know
that you can't stop me.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Let's leave these pussies.
- I believe this is yours.
Soon.
Individually, these chemicals are harmless,
but mixed together
form a compound which is caustic
and can eat through metaI.
It is actually quite dangerous.
So, your homework assignment is to find
two chemicals that share that property.
Man, I'm sorry.
I could not get the camera to work.
Man, don't trip, all right? It's not your fault.
You didn't do nothing.
It's about time somebody
put them fools on notice.
The time is now.
Yo, Bradley, let me holler at you.
- What's up?
- Look, man, you better leave my boy alone.
You better watch it.
You will not be afraid.
You will not be afraid.
When the time comes,
you will not be afraid.
Can I help you, Dad?
Dad, I left a letter in my room
explaining everything.
You don't have to worry about me.
I'll be okay.
I know you'll be mad,
but I did what I thought was right.
Anyway, I know you'll be fine,
and Mom, she'll be okay with you there.
Okay, then. Bye.
- How's this?
- Perfect.
- How many RSVP'd to the party?
- Everyone.
I knew we could use their egos
to our advantage.
It's gonna be a night they'll never forget.
- We'll be Internet legends.
- Yeah.
Hey, come check this out.
- Sweet mother of Jesus.
- Check this.
That is hard core.
I think I know what hell is.
Hell is waking up every day
believing that the suffering
you're doing in life has meaning.
That somehow, if you endure it,
you gain valuable lessons.
The truth is, sometimes you just suffer.
There is no meaning.
We're just pawns
in a sick game of random chance.
Chaos.
My hell, silence.
The kind of silence
that makes your ears ring.
Be glad for it.
Mine's listening to my mom and dad
fight day after day.
Crashing plates.
Screeching tires.
Crying.
I fucking hate the crying.
I could use some silence.
Think we're going to hell?
No.
We've suffered enough.
We're doing God's work,
as far as I'm concerned.
Bring some justice into the world.
I can't wait.
I've been more at peace
ever since we first talked about this.
We'll all be at peace tomorrow.
Amongst other things.
- I'm not gonna go.
- Why?
Because I don't feeI good and I feeI fat.
Heather, you're such a drama queen.
You look great.
Well, yeah, but I really don't feeI good.
- And my stomach hurts.
- I told you not to eat that burger.
Red meat is for people who don't care
how they look, not hot chicks like us.
I think I'm gonna die.
If you don't go, we don't go.
Come on, you'll feeI way better
after a night of drinking and hot sex.
Okay, but if the party's lame,
we can leave early, right?
Honey, that's what the dream police do.
We break up bad parties.
Come on, let's go turn some heads.
Crap, I don't see anybody.
I know we're at the right place.
It's Edgar and Matty.
Hey, Nadya.
- What's up, guys?
- Tommy, what's up?
How's it going? Pirates, huh?
Lord,
we understand what we're about to do.
And with one sign from you, right now,
we will call off our plans.
We offer you this finaI chance.
So now you know, Lord, the fate of
those who are about to come here tonight.
And we leave their lives in your hands.
Man, it's too bad Riggs couldn't make it.
Man, that boy's got his priorities
all jacked up, all right.
First of all, if it was me, I'd quit that shit job
a hell of a long time ago, all right?
Tonight is what? It's time to party, right?
- It's time to party, baby!
- Hell, yeah!
Party our asses off.
You know what I'm saying.
- Fuck.
- Shit.
Fuck. Roll down the window, man.
- Shit, man, we are going to fucking jaiI.
- Shut up, all right?
- Roll them the fuck down.
- Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Oh, my God, dude.
- Get the fucking window down.
- Shut your fucking mouth.
- All right. He's getting out, he's getting out.
- Hey, hey, hey, calm down, calm down.
- I got this.
- Shut up.
- Just let me do all the talking, all right?
- Shut up. Shut your damn mouth.
Friends, Roman and countrymen,
how we doing this evening?
Just fine, Officer. How about yourself?
Well, I'm doing pretty good.
Thanks for asking.
Now I'll tell you why I pulled you over.
You was going about 15 miles per hour
over the speed limit.
Now that was why I pulled you over.
But why you're in trouble,
that's a whole other matter.
I don't understand
what you're talking about.
You don't understand... You don't
understand what I'm talking about?
No, I...
Don't bullshit me, boy.
What, you think I wasn't young once?
I know what it's like to chase the puss
and get high.
- What are you looking at?
- Sorry.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we try a little honesty?
All right. Honestly, this is my brother's car.
He smokes a lot of pot.
We don't smoke that...
We don't smoke pot at all, do we?
- Do we, boys?
- No, sir.
- There's no pot.
- Never.
- No pot-smoking in this car.
- No, sir.
- You expect me to believe that?
- Yeah, I was kind of hoping so.
Well, I don't. So I tell you what.
I'm gonna give you one chance.
If I hear anything but
the truth, you boys...
You're gonna be in for a long night.
Yes, Officer, we've been smoking.
That wasn't so bad now, was it?
So I'll tell you what you're gonna do.
You're gonna hand over all the weed
right now.
Who's got the weed?
- Now.
- Give it to him, dude!
We got the weed, okay.
There's all of it.
Today's your lucky day.
You know why?
'Cause I'm feeling Christ-like,
and I think that I am gonna forgive
all of your sins on this fine evening.
- Thank you, Officer. We appreciate it.
- But I'll tell you what.
Next time you boys
come through Rocky Branch,
- know whose town you're in.
- Yes, sir, we will.
- Dude, that was so fucking close.
- Oh, my God, dude.
- Can you believe that?
- I am freaking bugging out, man.
- You kidding me?
- Luck has got everything to do with it.
He didn't get all the weed, bitches.
- Shit.
- Yeah, this is gonna be our lucky night.
Come on, let's go!
- Get that party started up.
- Yeah.
- Fuck, yeah!
- There she goes.
- Give me an "O." Give me an "O."
- All right.
Look at those breasts bouncing over there.
Those are beautifuI to me, to my eyes.
Is that... Is that a stripper? Riggs!
You son of a bitch.
- Hey, I thought you were at work.
- I was working.
But the truck we were supposed to load
never showed up,
so my boss said, "There's nothing to do,
go home. " What did I do?
- Came to party with my boys!
- Came to party with the boys!
Hey, hey, hey, boys, boys, boys.
- Drinks. Let's get them in him.
- Let's get them in him!
Party!
So, look, basically, after that,
I've made it, right?
Shit, man. Kurtis is here.
- How'd he get in?
- I didn't see him get into the truck.
We can't let him leave.
- But he wasn't invited.
- Well, then, fate brought him here.
- Let me go talk to him...
- No.
Okay, he's here and he stays.
Fine.
It's time.
You know what to do. Nobody leaves.
- Let's take some shots, B!
- Fuck, yeah, yeah.
What the... Why the fuck am I tied up?
Get up, sleepyheads.
What kind of bullshit is this?
Take a moment and clear your heads.
What is this?
Some kind of haunted house thing?
There's actually a good explanation
for all this.
Man, this is kinky.
Now that everybody is awake, let's begin.
There's some good news
and there's some bad news.
The good news is, we don't plan to kill you.
The bad news is, you will wish we had.
Some of you will be spared,
but you will all bear witness to the horror,
just as you did in the hallways,
just as you sat idly by
as pain was inflicted upon us.
What you fail to understand with reason,
you will with wrath.
Dude, what the fuck are you talking about?
I'll tell you what I'm talking about, Miles.
This is about what you are due.
When we are done,
you'll have a new perspective on life.
And no one, no one will ever look upon you
the same again.
You will forever be changed.
Yeah.
That's what I said to your mom last night.
What my friend has there is a cattle gun.
It's used to kill cattle
by blasting a spike into their brain.
It's considered humane,
but I'll let you decide.
Dude, get that shit out of my face.
Look, who the fuck are you people?
This shit is stupid.
- Do I have your attention now?
- Why us?
Why us?
You know, that's the same question
we've been asking ourselves for years.
"Why us?"
Why us, always on the receiving end
of your taunts,
your laughter and your childish cruelty?
Now it's your turn to ask, "Why us?"
Who are you?
It's a little late
for you to get to know us now.
But if you must know,
we are the rejected, the humiliated.
We are the outcasts.
And tonight is our night, so relax.
It's the only thing you can do.
Anybody want to leave?
Come on. Anyone?
Anyone feeling heroic?
Tommy, you want to leave?
Yeah.
I want to take Nadya with me.
You are in no position to bargain.
And you should be worrying
about yourself, not her.
Release him.
Listen, I'm gonna get help.
I'm gonna get help.
I'll get help, okay? You'll be okay.
You're gonna be okay...
In front of you, Tommy, is a door.
Outside that door is two miles of woods
that lead to a highway right into town.
Good luck, because you will be hunted.
I'll go get help for you guys.
Go get it, then. That's the spirit, Tommy.
Go get them.
Love you, Nadya.
Pathetic, isn't it?
So sweet and so much love.
Not when you consider
he was cheating on you, Nadya.
With Heather.
Yeah. Yeah. Everybody knew about it,
but they decided to laugh at you
behind your back,
taking joy in your ignorance.
Interesting friends.
I want you to think real hard
and ask yourselves,
"Where did all this evil come from?
"What did I do to make someone hate me
so much to go to these lengths?"
Think of this as the final,
and there's only one question.
"What did I do to deserve this?"
This is messed up, man. This is messed up!
This ain't right.
I want these chains off of me!
What gives you the right to judge us, huh?
What gives you the right to play God?
You know, Bradley,
that's real funny coming from you.
But to answer your question,
God gave us the right.
We gave him a chance to stop this.
We gave him a chance to save all of you.
But he chose to remain silent.
Go to hell.
I'm already there.
While you ponder your little situation,
I have a little treat for you. Enjoy.
Fuck you. Get that shit out of my face, man.
Come on, fucker!
I'm not scared of you, bitch! Come on!
You want to fucking kill me, huh?
You fucking kill me, you motherfucker!
Bernard!
You killed him.
What did you give him?
What'd you put in him?
I didn't know you cared
so much about him, Bradley.
You know,
for a person who cares so deeply,
you really talk a lot of
shit behind his back.
But that's not what's important.
What is important is that he's alive.
He can't move, but he can feel,
so I'm sure he appreciates
your love and concern.
Don't do it.
Deeper, deeper, deeper.
Please. Please, stop.
Enough! Please. Please.
I have to admit,
that was a stellar performance.
You! You gave him the key.
He's the only one who ever stood up for me.
We agreed not to hurt him.
Wrong.
We were the only ones
who stood up for you. You betrayed us.
What did you do?
Consequences.
None of us are free from them.
- Help! Help!
- What the fuck?
Help, help!
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey.
Stay back. Stay back!
- Look, man, they're killing people.
- Who's killing people?
- What're you talking about?
- Just get some help!
- Get some help for what?
- They're killing people back there.
Who is killing people?
Emily, it's time.
He didn't have a right to do this.
Ravi should have made his choice.
We have to finish what we started.
It's what Ravi would have wanted.
Please. Please let her go.
We'll do whatever you want. Just please...
What are you doing to her?
It's a special compound we made up.
At first, she won't feel anything
but a cool sensation,
then a slight tingle, then a mild burn.
Soon enough,
it will begin to eat away at her flesh,
dissolving it ever so slowly
in the most painful way imaginable.
And she will become outside
what she is on the inside.
Disgusting.
You will all be happy to know
that Kurtis was able to get some help.
But the bad news is, the cop won't be
busting through the door, guns blazing.
He apparently took a bullet to the head.
Coward!
You coward.
You're a coward,
standing up there hiding behind that mask.
I'm not hiding behind this mask.
This is a reflection
of what you turned me into.
This is what I am on the inside.
I am a monster that you created.
Take off that mask.
Show me your face.
Fair enough.
You should know who's about to alter
the course of your life.
You?
You know, the irony of all this,
you actually empowered me.
I would have lived my life
all alone in the shadows, unassuming.
But you, you wouldn't allow me to do that.
You had to torture me.
You have nobody to blame for this
but yourself.
Open up, please. Open up.
I need some help.
Open up, please.
What the hell are you doing
banging on my door?
- Please, sir, I just need some help.
- Drop your gun.
- Look, they're killing everybody.
- Shut up, punk.
- Look, please just...
- I said shut up.
Now turn around.
Put your hands above your head.
- Man, there's still time to save everybody.
- I told you once, I told you too often.
Don't do this.
Don't hurt me, please.
Don't hurt me, please.
Don't beg. Don't give them the pleasure.
Please don't hurt me.
I know who you are.
You're that girI from schooI, Emily.
Now I'm Emily.
I'm Andy.
And I'm Jack.
Are you doing this to get even with us?
For how we treated you?
Can you think of a better reason?
I'm sorry for what we did.
You didn't deserve it.
I didn't.
Hurting us won't make you feeI better.
It won't fix anything.
Please, just end it now.
Let us all go.
Since you apologized,
I won't hurt you.
Thank you.
But for my generosity,
you must do me a favor.
I'm gonna need you
to cut all of Bradley's fingers off.
I can't.
Either way, he gets what is due him.
You do it,
or we do it.
It's the only way you can save yourself.
I can't do this. I can't hurt anyone.
Sure you can.
You hurt me.
Without even blinking an eye.
I can't, I just can't.
That's really a shame.
I bet Bradley would cut your fingers off
to save himself.
Wouldn't you?
What do you say, Bradley?
Save yourself from unimaginable pain
by inflicting it.
No.
Bradley, please don't. Please.
Bradley, it's you or her.
I know you'll need those fingers
to play football.
What would your life be
without people cheering you on?
Hey, wake up.
Sir, we could still save them.
Only person we need to think about saving
is yourself.
- Please, just call the police.
- No. You gotta understand something.
Anytime you show up on my property
with a gun in your hand and try to rob me,
- there are consequences.
- Sir, I was not trying to rob you.
- I was just trying to get some help.
- Sure.
You came here in the middle of the night
with a gun in your hand to ask for help.
Happens all the time.
You know what those military medals
are for, boy?
For not being stupid.
I was a fine, fine soldier.
If it weren't for those politicians
without any backbone,
we would have won that war
and I'd be a generaI by now.
- Look, just let me go and I can help them.
- Imagine.
Fighting a war, bleeding for your country,
only to be treated like a maggot by the very
nation that sent you there in the first place.
You understand what I'm saying?
I was a hero.
I saved lives.
Look, and you can be a hero again.
Just call the police.
In time.
First we gotta figure out who you are.
Pick them up.
Bradley. Bradley!
Please.
Please, please, no!
- I have to.
- No. No!
They're gonna hurt me if I don't.
They're gonna hurt me.
Bradley.
Show some fortitude.
- No!
- Get started, man. I'm waiting on you.
Attaboy, Bradley.
I knew you could do it.
I knew you could hurt someone else.
One down,
nine more fingers to go.
Ain't got all night.
Do you want him to stop?
All you have to do is find it in yourself
to inflict pain.
Can you do that?
See?
We all have a point
when we can do the unimaginable.
Look, if you'll just call the police,
I'll confess to them.
All in good time, boy.
You know, my grandfather was in Vietnam.
My dad was two
when he was gunned down in the jungle.
Is that right?
You're not the only one
who's made sacrifices for his country.
My dad was in Desert Storm.
He came back with that Gulf strain.
He was never the same since.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
I don't know how to prove it to you, sir,
but I'm telling you the truth.
And I'm telling you the truth when I say
there's some kids that need your help.
Look, we were at this party down the road.
They drugged us.
- We don't know...
- You mean the Workley place. Yeah.
I met that kid. Dane. He's a nice kid.
Dane.
Now for a little mood music.
Jack, lights, please.
Emily.
I think she needs a little bit of inspiration.
Don't you?
I don't want to hurt him.
He deserves it.
- This can't be happening.
- It is.
You have about two minutes
before your skin begins to dissolve.
Cut off his fingers
and I'll remove the compound. Hurry.
Just do it.
No.
No!
I won't do it.
I don't care how much you hurt me,
I won't hurt my friends.
I appreciate your loyalty,
but you'll have to suffer for it.
Yes, please send some officers down to
the Workley residence. We got some hot...
There are some niggers
robbing the Workley place.
They got guns and all kinds of shit.
Send everybody.
Do you know my name?
Do you know my name?
You don't even know my name, do you?
My name is Dane,
and you've tortured me since we were kids.
Please.
Please don't hurt me anymore.
Don't hurt me anymore.
You're a reaI coward, huh? You know that?
And do you know why I'm gonna hurt you?
'Cause you can't stop me.
Any of that ring a bell, Brad?
Please don't cut off my fingers.
Don't you cut off my fingers.
Please, don't you cut off my fingers!
Don't you cut off my fingers!
Please, don't cut them off,
don't cut them off, don't cut them off!
Bradley, Bradley. Okay.
Okay, I won't cut off your fingers.
But here's the thing. I think that this world
will be better off without you.
But since I promised that I won't kill you,
I'll just make sure
that you can't do harm ever again.
I'm sorry.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
- I am sorry. I'm sorry. I am sorry.
- Oh, are you sorry, Brad?
- I'm sorry.
You're only sorry
because you have no choice but to be sorry.
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
And that means, Brad, that you're not sorry.
I spent a great deaI of time thinking about
how I'd like to get even with you,
and no matter what I came up with,
I just didn't feeI satisfied.
The anger and the hatred
that you poured into me for years
made it impossible.
But I came up with a way, Bradley.
I came up with a way to take everything
that you love away from you.
You will never, ever enjoy sex again.
You'll never, ever play football again.
And you,
you will spend the rest
of your little pathetic life
confined to a wheelchair!
Remember biology, Bradley?
Remember we learned that if somebody
severed the human spinaI cord,
they'll become instantly paralyzed?
No. No, you probably
don't remember that lesson
'cause you were too busy
devising ways to fuck me and my friends!
Well, guess what, Brad? Guess what?
I did some devising of my own.
Every time you hoist yourself into
that wheelchair, I want you to think of me.
Smiling.
In a short time,
the sun will come up
and this will all be over.
You don't know it just yet,
but you have all been a part of history.
The events of tonight will live on forever.
We gave meaning to all your lives tonight.
No thank you necessary.
Sicko.
You're all going to jaiI.
No.
No, we're not.
Do you remember
when we were sophomores, Riggs,
and you offered me a ride home
because it started to rain?
What does that matter?
Well, that's just it, Riggs.
That one act of kindness
is a reason why I considered
letting you go,
- why I hadn't cut out your tongue.
- I don't care what you do to me!
Fuck you, Dane!
Fuck all you bastards!
You really do have a big mouth,
huh, Riggs?
I appreciate your courage
in the face of danger.
There is something to be said
about defiance.
There's nobility to it.
And there's a price to pay.
Shouldn't have opened your big fat mouth.
I got two of them.
You're crazy, old man.
Hey, kid, I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
It's cooI.
You come banging on my door at 5:00 in
the morning with a gun in your hand,
I might not believe you, either.
Let me ask you something.
Is it all true about your pa?
About being in the military
and everything?
No, I made all that bullshit up.
My dad works for a steeI mill.
His dad worked for a steeI mill.
I just don't want to end up
doing the same thing, you know?
Yeah. Well, it's all the same.
But you gotta save those kids.
If you don't, you'll live to regret it.
Like I did.
I didn't save anybody.
I hid.
Just tried to save myself.
I watched my friends die.
I was just too scared.
Just hang in there, man.
Yeah.
Riggs, this is really gonna hurt you.
Good news is,
this can only happen once in a lifetime.
Let him go. Don't make me kill you, Dane.
I suggest you turn around and leave, Kurtis.
We have no issue with you.
Yeah, well, I got an issue with you.
I don't like being shot at.
You weren't invited to this party.
You shouldn't have come.
Fate brought me here, to stop you.
- Cut off his tongue.
- Do it and I'll kill both of you.
Fine. Kill us. We had no plans of living
after today, anyway.
We only do what we plan to do.
I'm serious.
I don't know if you've noticed,
but so are we.
Dane, you've been my friend a long time,
but I can't let you do this.
You know,
I wish there was more people like you.
Then we wouldn't be here.
Come on, man, I know Riggs is a prick,
but he don't deserve this.
You're wrong. He does. Andy, do it.
You should have left
when you had the chance.
I've had enough.
Me, too.
We're all responsible.
Kelli, I think you're wrong.
I really do think
you would've come to like me.
I just wanted to be friends.
Police! Freeze! Drop the weapon!
There are more like us out there.
I said drop it! Just drop the weapon!
It's not worth it. We can work it out!
You're too late.
How do I look?
Okay. On three, two, one.
Police have identified the killers
as disgruntled students
who kidnapped, drugged and dismembered
fellow students without cause.
Certainly, it will be a long time
in the healing process,
and all we can do is pray
for the families of the victims.
Think of this as the final,
and there's only one question.
"What did I do to deserve this?"
Mommy, why does that girl's face
look like that?
