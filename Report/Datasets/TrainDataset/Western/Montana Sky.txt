Where are your sisters?
Start without 'em.
Willa, they're blood.
They're nothing to me.
The cancer took
Jack Mercy
quicker than
his own damn funeral.
I've got two turkeys
in the oven,
and 12 pounds of potatoes
on the stove,
and I real--
Wait a minute.
BESS:
Uh-huh.
Is that your sister Lily?
I wouldn't know.
I've never met her.
Hi, uh, you must be--
Lily.
Sorry, I'm, um--
I'm a little bit
of a mess.
You look fine.
I'm Adam Wolfchild.
I'm Willa's brother.
Half-brother.
ADAM:
Come and join your family.
I, um--
I didn't know
this would be outside.
Now can we start?
Uh, no, we--
We've got one more coming.
What's the rush?
Jack ain't going nowhere.
Not unless they got
hookers in heaven.
Shh.
Heaven or hell,
either one,
he's just as miserable.
I can radio the airport,
Willa,
see if her plane is late.
Thanks, Nate.
WILLA:
There's no need.
NATE:
Is that her?
Who else?
WOMAN: It's a bar fight.
They're drunk,
They're hockey players.
What do you want them to do,
go to therapy?
Damn it, all right, listen,
I gotta go, I'm at my--
--father's grave.
Hi, uh,
I'm Tess.
Willa.
Oh, you're the...cowgirl?
Yeah.
Oh, hi.
Say hello
to Lily Mercy.
Hi there.
Nice to meet you...
sis.
PREACHER:
Friends.
We are here
to lay Jack Mercy
to his final rest.
The Bible tells us
never again will he hunger.
Never again
will he thirst.
The sun will not
beat down upon him,
nor any scorching heat.
TESS:
Bye.
Oh, damn it.
Oh, God.
They're your kin.
You have to talk
to them some time.
They're sleeping in my house
and eating my food.
That's enough.
Wait a second.
Where are you going?
Soda Butte.
Fences need to be checked.
Now?
Daylight's wasting.
I shouldn't have to remind you
that you have guests out there.
WILLA:
Then don't.
"Rude" is a four-letter word.
So is "work,"
but it still has to be done.
These people have come
to pay their respects.
No.
It's only fitting.
They have come to gawk
and prowl around the house.
Now, I've got a ranch
to run here, Bess.
Hands need to see
that it is business as usual.
That Mercy Ranch
is still being run by a Mercy.
Honey.
What?
You have a right to grieve.
He didn't give me a chance
to say goodbye
or take care of him.
I didn't even know
he was sick.
Uh.
TESS:
Just sell the script, all right?
Whatever it takes.
Sacrifice a virgin,
I don't care. Just sell it.
Great, great.
We'll have lunch on Monday
to celebrate.
Bye. Thanks.
Hey there.
So where are you from?
Virginia.
Your mom
was trophy wife number two?
Actually,
she was a photographer.
She, um, came out west...
...and met Jack Mercy
when she--
Hey there,
sugar nugget.
No.
No, I'm just here
for whatever legal stuff.
Then it's adiós,
Dodge City.
Okay, bye.
And, um...
your mother
was a stripper?
No.
No, she was
a restaurant hostess.
And you'd be what,
eight years older than Willa?
No, I don't think it's eight.
I think it's more like...
Yeah.
Remind me to alter
my driver's license.
Tess, Lily.
I'm Sheriff Nate Torrence,
and I'm very sorry
about your father.
Your sister Willa would like
to get back to ranching,
and so she has asked that
her attorney read the will now.
If that's all right
with the two of you.
Now?
Yeah,
that's one way to reduce
the billable hours.
How long do you intend to stay
in Montana?
Uh, about a half-hour.
Remind you of Hollywood?
In Hollywood,
those are house pets.
Willa, I can read the will,
or just give you
the terms and conditions.
Whatever's fastest,
Ken.
Bess,
as his long-time
housekeeper,
Jack left you $1000
for every year
you've been at Mercy.
That's $34,000.
Good Lord.
What am I gonna do with
a fat lot of money like that?
Adam, you receive 20,000.
Oh, no, no,
now that's not right.
Adam's my half-brother.
He's lived here his whole life.
He should get the horses
he's trained,
and the house he lives in.
Half-blood
meant no blood to Jack.
Oh, I'll say.
I remember one time
when this girl came bursting
into my kitchen.
And she said that this
little boy with her was Jack's.
She claimed
that it was Jack's and--
Ooh, why, he kicked her butt
right out that kitchen door
and sent her packing.
Really?
You and I will be lucky
if he left us a toilet seat.
Don't you think?
Mercy Ranch business
is to continue as usual
with Willa as operator,
but...
there are conditions.
You haven't said anything
about Ham yet.
Ham? Oh, the foreman.
Uh, no, he, uh--
He isn't mentioned
in the will.
Ham gets nothing?
Jack left
each of his daughters
a one-third interest
in the ranch.
Us?
What?
A three-way split?
These two have--
Have nothing to do
with the ranch.
They've never even been here
before today.
Let's hear it out, Willa.
In order to inherit,
the three of you must live
on the ranch together
for one full year.
And at the end of that time,
if conditions are met,
each of you will have
one-third interest.
I-I-I-- Uh--
I'm sorry, I've got
a third of an interest
in a cattle ranch
in Nowhere, Montana.
Now I've gotta live on it?
Willa, uh--
Excuse me.
Um, why don't you just
give me my share in cash,
and I'll get out of your life.
KEN:
Miss Mercy,
your father's terms are clear.
Now, you have a right
not to agree to these terms.
But if you don't,
the entire ranch will be donated
to the Nature Conservancy.
Donated?
To the tree-huggers?
My father hated those people.
It's ironclad.
If any one of the three
of you leaves,
the ranch is forfeited.
You'll each get
one hundred dollars.
I'll stay, Willa.
It's not fair to you.
As soon as the year
is over,
I'll--
I'll sell you my share.
Everyone knows the ranch
is already yours.
Really, that's--
That's touching.
But I'll be damned
if I waste a year of my life
in some godforsaken wasteland.
Out of sight, out of mind
in Hollywood.
Where's that damn limo?
Ken, you may wanna tell
Hollywood there
how much her portion
of the wasteland is worth.
Approximately
$8 million.
TESS:
Hey, hon, it's me.
Listen, cancel my lunch
on Monday. I'm staying over.
My sense of duty, that's why.
It's not every day
your father dies.
Uh, Willa?
Yeah?
Um...
there's one other provision
of the will.
Uh, during
the probationary year,
your father designated
myself and Ben
to supervise the running
of the ranch.
Ben McKinnon?
Mm-hm.
That chicken hawk's gonna be
looking over my shoulder
for a year?
Ken, he wasn't even
at the damn funeral.
Well, he had business
in Bozeman.
He'll be back tonight.
And, yes,
he knows he's named.
Up at the crack of noon,
are we, Hollywood?
Don't be waitin' on her.
I don't mind.
I do.
Stop picking on her.
I'm not picking on her
and stay outta my face.
Oh, I'll be in your face there
for a year, missy.
You might wanna get used to it.
And you better get used
to how things work around here.
We got a thousand animals
depending on us.
We got crops to raise.
If you stay,
you can't just sit around
on your padded ass.
You gotta work.
Writing is work.
Of course,
how would you know that?
I'm sorry,
you don't even read.
You do the chores I tell you to,
or come winter
you're gonna be pitching a tent
in the snow.
Like hell, you flat-chested,
knock-kneed little bitch.
Remember,
I walk, you lose.
If you think
I'm gonna take orders
from some ignorant,
pie-faced cowgirl
you're more stupid
than you look.
Willa,
what's going on?
BESS:
Adam,
could you please take Lily
for a walk?
And the rest of us
will re-fix breakfast.
Whew.
I'm ashamed enough
for both of you.
I knew
both your mamas,
and they expected better.
Look, here's the deal...
tough girl.
You think it's easy for me
to leave my friends, my career
for a year?
Well, it's not,
but I'm not giving up
what's mine either.
Yours, my ass.
I'm as much his daughter
as you are.
I didn't grow up here because
he tossed me and my mom out,
thank God.
But I'm staying for the year.
End of story.
Do you ride?
Ride what?
Ha! Figures. Probably
don't know the difference
between a hen
and a cock, either.
Believe me,
I know the difference.
Hey,
those bruises...
on Lily's neck.
She say anything about them?
Not to me.
She'll tell Adam.
Sooner or later,
everyone tells Adam what hurts.
Mm-hm.
You know, Hollywood,
you should do yourself a favor.
Get yourself
some long underwear.
You're gonna need it.
Usually, Charlie
only likes cows,
but he likes you.
I guess
I didn't say that right.
Until he turns against me.
How big is the ranch?
Twenty-five thousand acres.
ADAM:
Across those fields
and over White Stone Peak.
Stay here a year,
you'll never see all of it.
Is it big enough
to get lost in?
Is that what
you're looking to do?
I saw the bruises.
I have an ex-husband.
It was his going-away present.
My mom was a Blackfoot.
She lived on the res.
My dad would beat her
pretty bad.
Then she escaped
to this ranch.
Jack Mercy took us in.
He wasn't all bad.
My ex-husband, Jesse,
he's back in Virginia
on parole, but--
A couple of days before
I got the news about my dad,
he surprised me
in a parking lot.
I couldn't report him,
he'd just hurt me worse.
So I just--
I ran.
That's what I'm always doing,
running away from him.
But...
At least he can't leave
Virginia.
I wasn't stupid, Adam.
I was only married
six months.
I tried
to get out of it but--
No one's listening
except the hills.
WILLA:
Come here, Charlie.
Come here, boy.
Come on, Charlie, come on.
He likes me, huh?
Let me show you
the rest of the horses.
Hyah. Hyah.
Hyah.
Oh, I could help you
with that.
I don't need your help,
McKinnon,
with my leg or my ranch.
Suit yourself.
Generally, though,
you gonna be riding a horse
you might wanna keep
your pants on.
I was wearing pants.
The coyote jumped up,
and I was gonna shoot
the damn thing.
Then Charlie started barking
like a lunatic
and it spooked Moon.
And I don't need
your supervision
to get her.
I'm sorry about your pa,
Willa.
I didn't ask him
to make me the overseer,
but I am gonna honor
his request.
So we can do this peaceable
or we can lock horns.
Either way,
I'm doing it.
Your sisters as pretty
as you are?
Bet they're friendlier.
I'm gonna come calling...
find out.
We can discuss plans
for the ranch.
I will be telling you
the plans,
Ben McKinnon.
We're not gonna be
discussing anything.
And if you even think for--
What is the matter
with that dog?
Isn't this
the old cow camp?
I do believe we used to park
up here,
and you used to show me
the midnight gopher dance.
You showed me the dances,
and you were a liar
even then.
Charlie.
Something's dead.
What?
Something's dead.
Do you smell that?
Nope,
it's the Indian in ya.
Whoo.
Cougar?
Cats don't kill
and leave the meat like that.
A coyote
couldn't have done that.
He's mutilated.
He's butchered.
There's only one predator
that did that.
A man.
I'm getting my herd down
off the mountain.
Yeah, I reckon
I better do the same.
Willa.
You watch out, okay?
Yeah.
You're killing
that steak.
You said well done.
I'd like to tell the difference
between it and a rock.
When did you become
a connoisseur?
Little ketchup on it,
you'd eat that sock.
Yeah, well, cook this up.
It's bound to be
an improvement.
Ah, lookie here, Ham.
We got company for dinner.
Try not to ruin her health.
No, I'm not hungry.
We start rounding up cattle
tomorrow.
What? Why?
They're getting as fat as toads
up there.
I want 'em down now.
Well, they're your cattle.
Yes, they are.
And one of them's been butchered
just outside of 3 Rocks Land.
Butchered?
Cougar?
Not unless cats carry knives
these days.
Somebody hacked it up
into pieces and just left it.
Ah, balls.
We lost a couple to a big cat,
all right?
Jim and I tracked it
there yesterday.
Uh, it must have circled around,
and, uh, got one more cow,
that's it.
I know the difference between
claws and a knife, Pickles.
Hey, have any of you guys
seen anything?
Campers, hunters, anything,
anyone?
No. We came across a campsite
yesterday
when we were tracking
that cat.
But it was cold,
two or three days cold.
Yeah, they left beer cans
all over,
like it was their backyard.
They oughta be
shot for it too.
I still don't understand
what that's gotta do
with us bringing the herd
down early.
Ham,
you're the head man,
what do you say?
Mercy Ranch runs the way
it always has.
Old man's in the ground,
I'm operator now.
You'll take orders from me.
All due respect, well,
we were just sort of wondering
how you're planning
to keep the others--
Your, uh, sisters.
--on the ranch.
Well, they'll take orders
from me too.
Well, the one with the bod,
I'm sure she'll fall
right in line.
Sorry.
She's your sister.
We ride at first light.
HAM:
Willa?
Yeah?
About the hands...
You might wanna tread
a little easy.
What do you mean?
It's your first time
in deciding on
how things go around here.
They don't like to be bossed
by a woman.
Especially one as, well,
young as you.
They don't or you don't?
It is what it is.
Ham,
I'm sorry.
My father should've left you
what you were owed.
I got no problem with it.
That was Jack.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, hey!
MAN 1:
Hyah!
MAN 2:
Hey, hey, hey!
MAN 1: Giddap!
MAN 2: Hyah!
So much space.
Space is money.
White man's usually
figuring a way
to profit from nature.
Charlie!
Get back here, Charlie!
Charlie!
I'll remember that
next time, Charlie,
when you want a bone.
You got yourself
a friend there for life.
Pickles, pick up
that stray over there.
PICKLES:
Yeah, I got him.
HAM:
That takes care of Brush Creek.
All that leaves is the strays
up on north mesa.
Where does she think
this is, Vegas?
All she needs now
is a damn umbrella
in her drink.
I get the feeling, uh,
there's no anchor
in that one.
Maybe you could give her
something constructive to do.
She'd screw it up.
It'd cost us.
HAM:
Look, we got most
of the herd down.
Me and the boys can handle
the strays over in the mesa.
She's your kin, Willa.
You can always trust your own.
Okay. This is called
a curry comb.
No, it is not
an eating utensil.
Softer brushes--
Oh, phew!
--and Moon's over here.
So stinky.
So you can put the feed
right in that bucket
right there.
And this is Moon.
Okay, let's do this.
Come here, girl.
There you go. Good girl.
Here we go.
Okay, so when you're combing,
you're gonna go
right along the grain.
Just like this,
but not on the legs or the face.
The softer brushes
are for the whole body,
legs and face.
You got it?
It's not brain surgery.
No, but it is my horse.
Yeah, why am I taking care
of your horse?
Because I don't trust you
with anybody else's horse.
Listen, I got a buyer
from Billings
and he needs attention.
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna go.
Yeah, sure, what the hell.
I'm good with a comb.
Jack teach you all this stuff?
Yeah. Between his benders.
Be glad.
You're the one that got away.
Yeah, well...
you're the one he kept.
Take care of my animal.
Hi.
LILY:
Okay. Go on. Get it. Go on.
ADAM:
That's a good boy.
LILY:
Come on.
ADAM:
Good boy.
LILY:
Come here. Come here.
Hey, we're gonna
vaccinate those heifers
first thing in the morning,
right?
Sure thing.
Okay. Get some rest.
You too.
LILY:
Charlie!
Here, Charlie.
Have you seen Charlie?
Uh, try the feed shed.
He likes to chase the mice.
Wait till you see.
I taught him
how to play dead.
Hey, maybe you could teach that
to your sister too.
McKinnon?
What do you want?
A cold beer
would be nice.
This isn't a saloon.
Make it quick.
I haven't had supper yet.
Well, I haven't
had supper yet either.
Probably not gonna get
an invitation, though.
Nah, not in the mood
for company.
You're never in the mood
for company.
So, what are you doing here?
Supervising?
After you left,
I tried to track
whoever messed up that cow.
Trail died out on me.
Thought you should know.
Yeah,
Pickles thinks it's kids,
doped up
and getting crazy.
What do you think?
I didn't.
But now I think
it's most likely.
Where's your sisters?
Around.
Maybe I'll take a shine
to one of 'em.
Get her out of your hair
for a while.
Do women always just fall
at their feet for you?
All but you.
You know,
you once said to me
that you don't want me
any more than I want you.
When did I say that?
When my father offered you
for you to marry me,
and you said no.
That was a sweet deal.
Except the "marrying you" part.
Only thing he cared about
was piling up
the biggest spread
in the state.
He wanted 3 Rocks just as much
as your father wanted Mercy.
Wouldn't it be sweet
if the McKinnons finally came
into the Mercy Ranch
through marriage?
Are you mad because I said no
or because you wanted me
to say yes?
You only want my land.
That's not all I want.
Yeah, apparently.
Because any closer
and you'd be
on the other side of me.
Are you afraid
to let me kiss you?
What if I was?
Mm-mm.
Let's find out.
Really?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Your ego needed
a good dunking, McKinnon.
Appreciate the shower.
Anytime.
ADAM:
Willa, the stables. Come quick!
LILY:
Charlie.
Oh, my God.
Take her inside.
Lily.
Let's go back
to the house, okay?
We'll take care
of Charlie.
TESS:
Shh, it's okay. It's okay.
Two animals butchered
in one month.
Someone's sending you
a message.
Hey, how's Lily?
Bess found her
a sleeping pill.
She and Tess
finally got her down.
Well, we buried Charlie.
What's left of him.
Thanks for that.
I talked to your men.
Ham vouches for all of 'em.
What do you mean
you talked to my men?
That's my job.
Well, a dead cow
on a mountain's one thing,
but Charlie was killed
right in the heart
of this ranch.
By somebody
who knew the property.
Pickles, someone like that.
Who would kill a dog
to scare you?
Do I look scared?
No, you don't look scared.
But I wish you were.
Bet you do.
You know,
it could have been anyone
doing the killing,
McKinnon.
Including you.
I was in the kitchen,
with you.
But earlier.
We don't know what time
Charlie was killed.
And you covet this land.
You always have.
There's only one thing
on Mercy Ranch that I covet.
I don't need you
to protect me.
Now get back your ass
back to your own spread.
I'm hungry,
and I don't want you here.
You know,
your land marches with mine.
And you're my responsibility
for one year.
And I'm gonna
keep my eye on you.
Stop it.
Just-- Just stop it.
Jeez, we haven't wrestled
in 20 years.
You filled out real nice.
WILLA:
You are gonna break
Adam's heart, Lily.
LILY:
I don't wanna put him in danger.
Adam or anyone else.
That's the whole point.
Hon, you can't leave,
or we're gonna have to say
goodbye to this ranch
forever.
Never mind my $8 million.
What about your $8 million?
No, the family
has had this land
for a hundred years,
Lily.
You don't understand.
It's happening again.
So some animals were killed.
We'll figure out who did it.
There's no reason to leave.
I did everything right.
Restraining order,
safe house,
testifying in court, but...
he found me anyway.
Who?
My ex-husband.
Jesse.
Is that who gave you
the bruises?
I thought he was
back in Virginia.
But what if he's been released?
What if he sent someone
to find me. What if--?
Then you will be
protected.
Right here
on your family's land.
You don't know him, Willa.
Killing these animals,
it's just what he'd do.
Well, it sounds like
you've been running from him
for a few months.
What would happen
if he figured out
where you were right now?
Then what?
Where would you run to
that he wouldn't find you?
You know, you are
going to be safe here.
I promise you that.
I promise.
What she said.
Okay.
Don't you have work
to do?
Oh, I'll get to it
when I get to it...
Annie Oakley.
New place in town.
Let's try it.
Sure.
You okay?
Yeah.
Miguel, Jesse.
Habla mi honest, amigo.
When's my damn hacienda
gonna be ready?
How long?
Well--
Well, then, just do it.
Saw, hammer, get going.
Patience.
Girl, you hungry?
Look what I got for you.
Look at all this.
Want some of that?
Look at all I've got for you.
Ow!
That's a hundred-dollar
manicure.
Or it would be if I wasn't
held prisoner. Damn it!
I think that horse
has a mind of its own.
Uh, yes, well...
Just like her owner.
Right?
Thank you, that was nice.
Well, that certainly is
a very pretty hand you have,
Miss Mercy.
Keep it safe.
Well, I declare.
Are you flirtin' with me,
sheriff?
I got a phone call
from Ben McKinnon.
I'm here to speak
with him and Willa.
Oh, oh.
Sorry.
Uh, my radar's wrecked.
Too long in the jungle, I--
I think.
So you're here
about the animal killings?
I am, yeah.
It's horrible stuff, huh?
Well, are you settling in?
As best I can.
It's not my normal...
milieu.
It's not what I'm used to.
A lot of Hollywooders
come up here and buy up land.
Plunk down big old houses,
cost a ton.
Then they go about
raising buffalo
or saving mustangs
or God knows what else.
What? You don't like
Californians?
Californians don't belong
in Montana, ma'am,
not as a rule.
And they all run back
to their clubs
and sushi bars soon enough.
And I would imagine that
that is what you will do
when your year is up.
You bet your ass.
Yeah, no, you can
keep your Big Sky, thank you.
I'll take Beverly Hills any day.
With all that smog
and mudslides and earthquakes?
No, no, stop.
Please, you're--
You're making me homesick.
Hey, Nate.
Willa.
What's going on?
Well, she's out of her mil--
Milieu.
Well, would you please
stop playing with her
and get in here?
We got work to do.
Well, it was nice
to see you, Tess.
Yeah, it was nice
to see you too.
And by the way,
there is nothing wrong
with your radar.
WILLA:
He's Lily's ex-husband.
His name is Jesse C. Carne.
He is supposed to be restricted
to the Richmond, Virginia area,
and he was last seen
three weeks ago.
I know dead animals
aren't a high priority
in these parts, but...
For Lily's peace of mind,
it would help a lot.
Well, I'll see
what I can dig up, Willa.
Thanks.
Willa, uh...
Something's wrong with Moon.
Colic?
Appears to be.
Heart rate's elevated.
What's colic?
VET:
Pain in the abdomen.
Oh, she's trying
to get up.
If she does,
she'll probably make it.
Otherwise....
Ooh. Whoa.
Easy. Easy.
I'm sorry, what--
What causes colic?
Well, it depends.
Have there been any changes
in her diet?
Tess, what have you
been feeding her?
Who, me?
I-I've been feeding her grain,
just like you told me.
That's corn.
Heh. Isn't corn a grain?
Corn could kill her,
you stupid bitch.
I didn't know.
Well, didn't you look?
I fed her what's in the bucket.
Hey, you see this?
Here, that's worm larvae.
TESS:
What?
This feed's infested.
I don't understand.
Get her outta here.
Willa, just--
Get her out of here
before I kill her.
Oh, I'm gone.
Let's go, come on.
BEN:
Calm down, all right?
Just, calm down.
Unbelievable. I--
I fed Moon exactly the way
she told me to.
She had that horse 10 years.
Brought it up from a filly.
Really? Really?
Then why put a beginner
like me in charge? Why?
So she could reign superior?
Damn it. Damn it!
No amount of money
is worth this.
I should be back in L.A.
taking meetings,
taking jobs from people
who are taking them from me
right now.
Oh, my God.
You know what?
I didn't ask
to be stuck out here.
Definitely didn't ask
to be related
to that tight-assed bitch.
She didn't ask for it either.
How would you feel
if you suddenly had
the only home you ever knew
taken away from you?
I'm not to blame
for that.
Neither is she.
Look, you didn't live
with Jack Mercy.
He never gave her an ounce
of affection that I saw
or a word of praise.
She never had a mother
to turn to.
She could have left.
Yeah, she could have left.
But she loved this place
and she loved him.
You know, I don't think this
has anything to do with me so...
Hey.
Oh, it's got everything to do
with you,
and if you don't get that
then...
you got way too much
Jack Mercy in you.
I'm gonna walk her.
You oughta put a sweater on,
it's 6:00 in the morning.
What's wrong with you?
JIM:
Just give it a good yank.
You're there.
Got it. Cool.
Yeah.
It looks easy.
Yeah.
Yeah,
nice and hard.
Broke another nail.
I'm sick of this,
I'm just over it.
Wake up.
What?
I can't sleep.
WILLA:
This better be good.
If I get no sleep
for no reason, I get pissed.
Really?
Who would know
the difference?
Hey.
It was her idea.
Strip.
What?
There's no pretence
when you're naked.
No rank,
only vulnerability.
So take off your clothes
and get in the tub.
You Hollywood fruitcake.
Willa,
I haven't asked you to do
one thing since I got here.
It's always you
bossing us around.
Well, guess what?
It's my turn
to boss you around, so--
Tess, if she's afraid just...
Ugh.
Fine.
Tonight,
when I was in bed, I, um...
I had a nightmare.
I dreamt
that we lost the ranch.
Don't lose sleep over it,
Hollywood.
You'll get your $8 million.
No, it's not losing the money
that scared me.
It's... What--
Where would we end up if...?
I've got nowhere else to go.
Well, I'd go back to Hollywood,
where I have a career.
Or I may not.
Yeah, you told us.
Out of sight, out of mind.
And what about you, Willa?
I mean,
what would you do if--
If we lost Mercy Ranch?
I mean,
this land defines you.
It's everything you know.
It's everything
you've ever dreamed of.
What's your point?
We need each other.
To survive.
You're right.
I'm right?
Mark this day.
Willa Mercy agrees with me.
Doesn't mean I like you.
Okay.
If we're gonna get through this
for a year,
we have to stick together.
I can't have you and Lily
wandering alone.
Well, what about you?
Yeah, I mean being cocky
isn't much protection
against a blade.
Winchester is.
Awesome.
This feels great,
don't you think?
God, it's like sex,
only wetter.
Oh, my God, what am I saying?
If I don't get laid soon,
I am gonna squeak when I walk.
Well, what about Nate?
Nate?
Well...
a project.
You are, like,
predatory, I swear.
I just...
I don't get the whole sex thing.
You know what, honey?
I swear to God,
you need a rewrite.
Stay away from me.
No.
TESS:
Cheers.
Pickles, I need you
to check the fences
just north
of the old cow camp.
Otis Hinker thinks
they might be down.
Yeah, uh, Ham wants me
to fix this muffler.
Well, fix it and then
check the fences, today.
Damn.
I can't fix it.
The weld's broke.
Get it to town, get it welded,
and then check the fences.
Listen, I-I'm supposed
to take orders from Ham.
Pickles.
All right, I'm going.
Okay? I'm going.
I got this from the Virginia
Department of Corrections.
Lily's ex-husband skipped out
on his parole officer
about three months ago.
Which means that Jesse Carne
could be here in Montana.
Except that this parole officer
tracked down
a Marine buddy of Jesse's.
And this buddy showed the PO
a couple of postcards
from Carne, postmarked Mexico.
So now, Virginia has Guadalajara
searching for Jesse
to extradite him.
If they can find him.
And is that a long process?
The truth? Glacial.
Well, thanks, Nate.
I appreciate your help.
I doubt Jesse Carne's
your problem.
Yeah, now my problem is,
if it's not Jesse Carne,
then who is it?
I'm askin' the same question,
Willa.
Hey, how's that new burger place
on First Street?
I was gonna bring Pickles
some lunch.
I hear it's good.
So, what's Tess up to
these days?
Nothin' productive.
Why? You interested?
Well, she has her attributes.
Yeah, a 36-inch chest
and a mouth to match.
Yeah, there's that.
Well, call her, damn it.
And call me if you hear anything
about Jesse Carne.
Don't worry, Willa.
I bet Jesse Carne's a long way
from Big Sky Country.
Yeah.
The boss wants me here
gettin' the truck fixed
and up at the cow camp,
uh, checking fences,
at the same time.
I'll get you out of here
in a second.
Yeah.
Must be a female boss.
Yeah, three of them.
Three high-strung sisters.
Can't please one of 'em.
Talk is, one's a hot ticket
from Hollywood.
The other's a little slip
of a thing from Virginia.
Yeah. Yeah, Lily.
She's a sweet kid.
She's having
a rough time of it too.
Lily?
That's a pretty name.
PICKLES:
What the hell?
Hey, what are you doin' here?
Ah! Uh! Uh...
WILLA:
Oh! Oh!
Wait.
Oh.
M--
Let the morgue know
you'll be there
in about an hour.
Give me a call
when you get there.
Yes, ma'am.
Nate?
Yeah?
The victim sustained multiple
sharp-force injuries
to the throat and chest.
The scalp was removed
the old-fashioned way.
Most likely taken as a trophy.
What kind of weapon was it?
I'd say it was
a small, sharp-edged blade.
CORONER:
Killer knew what he was doing.
We found a carved-up horse
in the shed over there.
Pretty skilled job.
What direction
was Pickles hit from?
That's interesting.
An assailant armed with a knife
usually comes from behind,
but the victim
faced his killer head-on.
CORONER:
Allowed him to get close.
Happened very quickly
and with a huge amount of force.
Killer was somebody
Pickles knew.
Unofficially, yes.
Which means it was somebody
we all know.
Maybe we ought
to get her home for now.
I got a blood sample I need you
to ID over here.
I sent him out here, Ben.
It's my fault he's dead.
No, no,
someone's turned to murder.
You didn't cause that.
Somebody either
hates Mercy Ranch
or they want it so bad
they're willing to kill for it.
So I know
I'm computer illiterate
but I can't find a Jesse Carne
listed anywhere in Mexico.
I'm gettin' help
from Virginia and the Feds.
They aren't
turning up anything.
Interviewed all your hands,
including Adam.
Thanks. Adam?
If you were to forfeit
the ranch,
it would go
to the Conservancy.
Back to Adam's people.
Nate, that's crazy.
Well, Willa, I'm just
turnin' over every stone.
We also got a second
confirmation from the Feds
on the murder weapon.
Four-inch fixed
Western skinning blade.
Well, hell, every cowboy
in Montana has one of those.
You're grasping at straws,
Nate.
Yep, but he's out there.
And one of those straws
is him.
It's freezing,
damn it.
Haven't you ever
heard of heat?
Fire?
One of the four elements?
Great, just what I need,
science lessons
from Madonna.
Careful on that ladder,
Ham.
Whoa. Okay, buddy.
Why don't you come down now?
I can handle it.
Just stiff in this cold.
No, Ham. We'll get one
of the hands to do it, okay?
Get down now.
I'm already here,
I'll finish it.
WILLA:
Ham, down, now!
There you go.
Jack never had no trouble
with my work.
Any time you think
I can't do the job,
you can have
my paycheck ready.
I can't afford
to lose you. Ham.
That's great.
Well, that's great, Willa.
What if he goes and gets a gun?
Don't be an idiot.
I know my men.
Yeah? Well, I don't.
There's a murderer
running around Mercy Ranch,
and you have no idea
who it is.
Thought you had to be tough
to work in Hollywood.
No wonder you can't sell
one of your scripts.
Oh, my God.
I can't sell one because
I'm a thousand miles away
stuck in this hellhole.
They probably don't even
remember who I am.
Not my problem.
Jack Mercy left me this ranch
and the guts to run it.
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let him down.
Uh, I'll tell you
what is your problem, Willa.
You're spending your life
trying to please a dead man.
You can't even see him
for the bastard that he was.
You know what?
Finish off these stalls.
And I suggest you wash
that crap off your face
sometime before dinner.
What?
Mm, great.
Great, a Montana facial.
Fresh caught. Ice fishing.
Please,
make yourself comfortable.
Take your coat off.
I love visitors
at 10:00 at night.
Ken needs your signature
on this insurance form
for Pickles.
You eat?
Not yet.
Ah, you keep workin'
and not eatin',
you're gonna end up
flat on your face.
Face isn't half bad.
Appreciate your help.
Now, if you don't mind...
Why you so jumpy around me?
Because, Ben, you irritate me.
I'm seducing you, Willa.
Huh? That's what it is.
That's what
you're afraid of, huh?
That I could and...
I will.
You're not gonna be able
to do a damn thing about it.
I'm not afraid of you.
Prove it.
Right here, right now.
Mm...
I can't breathe.
All right.
We gotta finish this.
Come to my house
with me.
No. No, I don't wanna do that.
You think just 'cause
you've talked a dozen women
onto their backs
you can talk me onto mine?
What do you mean, a dozen?
It's, like, 10 or 11.
Come on, it's a joke.
Willa, you got the wrong idea.
I don't sleep around.
Well, neither do I.
But when it happens, it's--
It's special.
It's when I want it
and with who I want it.
Well, obviously,
I mistook your feelings.
Yeah.
And I apologize.
Good night.
Okay, bye.
Let me just say...
that you were doing a pretty
good job of kissing back
for somebody
who's not in the mood.
Hip-hip.
There you go.
ADAM:
It's a good horse.
It's got good withers,
good hips,
straight legs,
neck reined.
When I was a kid,
I had red hair.
They used to call me
the Red Hammer.
Why? Why'd they
call you the Ha--?
You can figure it out.
Easy now. Whoa, easy.
Yeah-- Oh!
Whoa.
BEN:
You all right?
Yeah, I don't know
what got into her.
Thanks.
Ho.
Hey.
Hey.
Aren't you supposed to be
out feeding cattle with Jim?
I was there.
I'm going back.
Excuse me for having
a life in between.
You know, you oughta
put more clothes on.
You're asking
to get a sunburn.
I'm not your problem,
Miss Green-Eyes.
Why don't you just
ask him to dinner?
A movie, a Roman orgy,
just do it.
And turn into you?
Whatever.
I'm having dinner
with the sheriff tonight.
What's your plan?
Nate asked you to dinner.
Where?
His place, my invitation.
But, hey, you know what?
You and yourself have
a great love life, so...
I don't know
what I was thinkin'.
You're doing great.
Hey.
Ben, brought ya something.
Baked ya a rhubarb pie.
Mm...
Ha, ha!
Keep it covered.
Don't want any flies on it.
Well, look at that.
Maybe I'll split that
with ya.
She's been avoidin' me
lately.
Well,
she prefers cowboys.
Well, what the hell am I?
You're upper management now,
McKinnon.
You still handle a horse
pretty good, though.
Well, gee, thank you.
From one cowpoke to another.
Well, Willa always was
a bit of a tomboy.
Jack never let me forget
he wanted a son.
Well, the crazy part
is he did have one.
Ha-ha.
Jack Mercy had a son?
No, it's a family legend.
Well, this woman
showed up one time. She was--
She was ragging out on alcohol
or dope or somethin'.
And she had the cutest
little boy with her.
She was claimin'
that it was Jack's.
Was he?
He refused to see the boy.
I mean, he thought
it was some kind of con
or somethin' but...
you could have another
half brother somewhere.
Probably to hell and gone
by now.
Jack just paid off
that floozy.
Paid her off
and kicked her out
to Idaho
or someplace.
Kind of warms the heart,
doesn't it?
Nate.
Tess.
Hey, there.
Hi, come on in.
I'm sorry I'm late.
No, no, we have
lots of time.
Let me take your coat from you.
Oh, thank you.
Sure.
Thanks.
I've ordered Italian
from Generro's.
But--
Oh.
--they'll be a while yet,
I imagine.
Wow.
Yeah.
Well, I--
I inherited it from my folks
and I've been living here
since I got out of the Navy.
Hm,
I love the cut
of that shirt.
What's that label?
Large.
I got you something.
Thanks to online shopping.
Something to remember me by.
Truth is, Tess...
I manage to think of you
without visual aids.
Okay,
I don't usually have sex
at my desk, Tess.
I'm not really prepared
for this.
Mm.
Look--
You know,
I'm not really sure
whether to be flattered
or terrified here.
Consider it a challenge.
Tess.
Tess, please.
What?
Tess, stop.
Stop.
What?
I know I'm just
a simple country boy, Tess,
but I've seen a lot
of animal breeding in my life.
And I know
when I'm being used.
No.
No, it's not like that.
Tess, I wasn't kiddin'.
What?
I wasn't kiddin'
when I said
I wasn't prepared
for this.
I'd-- I had hoped
that this would be the start
of something nice.
I'm sorry.
It's funny, I-I-I started
my life in Montana,
but I--
I grew up in a different world,
I guess.
You learn to get what you want
the wrong way, you know.
You're a great guy, Nate.
Really, you're--
I--
I think--
I think you're probably
just too good for me.
Maybe I should just--
I should have stayed in Montana.
I think I went too far away.
Well, that's me, you know.
The girl who goes too far, so--
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I gotta go.
Tess.
Uh...
You brought me a book, Tess.
That's a mighty fine start,
if you ask me.
I wanna plant gardens
with you, Adam.
And raise horses
and paint porches
and make children.
Let's make it real.
Let's get married, Lily.
When?
Oh, I know when.
When, um--
When the ranch is ours,
that very day.
Woo-hoo!
Woo!
Adam! Adam!
Lily.
Just get away from me.
You're comin' home.
Right now, with me.
No.
Or I'll kill him
for sure.
No.
Jesse.
Whatever you say.
It's just like old times.
Woo!
Oh.
Thank you, Jim.
You're welcome.
Pick me up
any time.
You look like the cat
that got the milk bucket.
You have a good time at dinner
last night? Get your fill?
Do I look like the kind of girl
who would kiss and tell?
No, you'd sing it
to the third balcony.
Hey there.
Hi, Tess.
Do you have
business here, Nate?
Yeah, I do.
I got a phone call from
Bill Jenks across the river.
He's got a couple saddled horses
running around on his land.
Says they got
Mercy brands on 'em.
And one of 'em's a bay.
Adam's horse?
Please, Jesse, please.
Just--
Just call someone
for Adam.
Who?
The Indian
you're sleepin' with?
I'll do whatever you want.
Just don't let him die, okay?
Oh, tears.
You never cried for me.
LILY:
I'm begging you.
You're my wife.
You're what's mine.
What do you
want me to do?
Shut up and drive.
All the way to Mexico.
Crazy bitch!
WOMAN:
Oh, my God.
Ah.
Yeah, 911.
Let's go.
No, no, no!
He's hurt.
Tess, got a first-aid box
on my front seat.
Alpha 016...
Adam, Adam.
...at Bugle Creek.
Adam Wolfchild, chest injury.
Code 2. Over.
WOMAN:
Roger. EMTs on the way.
How's his pulse?
Yeah, it's there.
...white male and young woman
fleeing an abandoned car.
How long ago?
It's okay.
Stay with us, buddy.
An hour.
Are you sure
he has the girl?
Whoever shot Adam
just abandoned his car.
He's taken
Lily hostage.
Tess.
Yeah?
Can you take care of him?
Yeah, yeah, I, uh--
I'm--
I'm all good.
Just hurry, okay?
Okay.
Willa.
Let's go.
We don't have
to do this.
You can still
make it right.
Keep moving.
NATE:
Send 'em Deerfoot Highway,
Send both units.
And do it now,
this man has a hostage.
If they stick to the trail,
they'll hit Ridgeback Road.
If they go off-trail,
they'll hit the river.
They try to cross
that river now,
anything could happen.
Unit 4, you boys secure
Ridgeback Road West.
I'll take the river.
JESSE:
What's across there?
LILY:
Three Rocks Ranch, I think.
How far is
the main house?
Two or three miles.
Footprint.
BEN:
Small enough to be a woman's.
They gotta be headed
downstream.
Yeah.
There.
Willa.
What?
Stay back.
Stop where you are!
Monroe County sheriff!
Put the gun down!
Put down the gun down now!
Put down the weapon!
My name is Nate.
Let's talk about the situation.
My name is Jesse By-God Carne.
And I got a pretty good idea
about the situation, Nate.
You're facing
kidnapping charges, Jesse.
That's federal time.
You put that gun down,
I'll reduce the charge.
Been there,
done that.
NATE:
Jesse, I reckon
you're not a bad person.
I believe you really care
about Lily.
She's going with me.
Right, baby?
Sure thing, Jesse.
Just do what he says.
NATE:
Well, where is it
you intend to go, Jesse?
Three Rocks Ranch.
That's my spread! What do you
think you're gonna find there?
JESSE:
Gee, I don't know. A helicopter?
A couple of steaks
and a case of beer?
I'm going to Mexico,
dirt wads.
With my everlasting wife.
Help me, baby.
When did you ever help me,
you bastard?
Come with me, bitch.
Adam?
He's gonna make it.
Tess is taking care of him.
He's okay.
We just got word
that he's gonna make it.
It's okay. It's okay.
I told the minister
we'd meet at 1. Is that okay?
Still leaves time
for pizza.
What about Adam's uncle's family
out at the reservation?
Yeah, they'll come
to the wedding
if they don't have
to finish calving.
I need to know.
We have to feed them.
Ask Adam.
I've got a ranch to run.
Willa,
he's your brother.
I have to deal with the flowers
and the caterer.
If you call
some buck-toothed loser
whose specialty is
pigs in a blanket a caterer.
All you have to deal with
is the umbrellas.
Ladies.
What?
Well, hi.
What are you guys doing here
during your precious lunch hour?
Come in.
Ladies.
I got a phone call
from the sheriff
down in White Stone Springs.
A hitchhiker down there,
young woman,
was tortured and scalped
last week.
Now, they think the m.o.
and the weapon used
matches Pickles' murder
two months ago.
Pickles?
Jesse Carne killed Pickles.
Maybe. Maybe not.
If Jesse didn't kill Pickles
and those animals, then...
who did?
Nate.
I appreciate you
coming down here but, um,
I've got to finish my lunch
and we got a lot of work.
So...
All right.
Just watch your back.
What does that mean?
Means watch your back.
The killing might not stop
with Pickles and that girl
down in White Stone.
Okay, I can handle it.
Relax, Mr. Supervisor.
Your year's almost over.
I love this dress.
The ivory's beautiful.
But do you think it's right
for a Western wedding?
Heh. What do you want,
fringe on it?
How about a badge? To go with
the armed security guards.
We're having the wedding,
Willa.
All right, let me see.
Let me see.
Hm. That's nice.
Does it come with that
mosquito-net thing
for your face?
A veil.
That's a veil.
Veil.
Ha. My God, is my work
ever gonna end with you?
Hello.
Willa, when's the last time
you had a date?
A date?
Yeah,
I've tried everything else.
I'm asking you to come
to the Fourth of July dance
at the Monroe County
Country Club with me.
You do dance, right?
Not a lick.
Great. Then you'll come?
Well, um, you know, I mean,
I got nothing better to do.
Pick you up at 8.
Was that Ben?
A date?
It--
It's a Fourth of July dance.
You know, at the country club.
Showtime.
Do you have
something to wear?
Yeah.
No.
We altered one
of Tess' dresses.
One of hers?
Must have had
to add some material.
You got that right.
Mostly in the bust though.
Uh-oh. Oh.
It's gonna look so pretty.
Oh, my gosh.
It's lovely.
I might as well go naked.
That was my first choice.
Lil, what do you think
of the green shoes?
Um...
Brown's cute.
Yeah. Yeah,
those are great.
All right. So, now all we need
is a little makeup.
And you'll be ravishing.
Oh, no, I-I'm wearing makeup.
Please.
You need some lipstick,
you need some powder.
Lily, you okay?
This is what sisters do.
I have sisters.
Oh, uh--
That's Nate and Adam.
Yeah.
Better get going.
We'll be late for the fireworks.
See you.
Okay. Bye.
There you go.
Oh.
Have fun, damn it.
Willa?
Am I late?
Well, I brought you these.
It's kind of like
bringing brass to gold.
You look gorgeous.
Have a drink.
These are nice.
Where'd you pick them?
I bought them.
In a store.
That's fancy.
Where is everyone?
Bozeman. The whole ranch went up
to watch the fireworks.
Supposed to be some fireworks
at the club before the dance.
I told you I don't dance.
Well, someone leads,
someone follows.
We'll figure it out.
Are you ready?
You gonna drink
that whisky I poured you
or you gonna let it
go to waste?
Hey, you took
Jack's picture down.
Yeah.
Let's drink to that.
It's about time somebody
ushered Jack out of the house.
Jack Mercy brought me
and my sisters into this world.
Made us who we are.
I'll give him that.
But...
I think I'm done listening
to Jack Mercy now.
Hm.
You smell good.
Tess sprayed some stuff on me.
Gunked up my face.
I like it gunked up.
You got anything on
under that dress?
Why? Have you developed
a sudden interest
in getting my clothes off?
There's nothing sudden
about it.
BEN:
Whose idea was the fireworks
at Bozeman?
I told you
I'd choose when and where.
My turn to lead.
But for my natural modesty,
I'd flip on
the car radio and...
go Kenny Chesney--
Shh.
--on this whole valley.
They're not awake
in the house yet.
Let's keep it
that way.
What's up?
I'm real sorry, Willa.
We got a bad situation.
The Forest Service called.
We got two more cattle
slaughtered up at the cow camp.
Ham's already took off.
We'll--
We'll take care of it.
You don't need this now.
Let's go.
Where are these animals
supposed to be?
I want what's mine.
The ranch
and everything on it.
It's my birthright,
same as yours.
Birthright?
Well, I'm half of you, Willa.
The half Jack Mercy
tossed away.
Hey, Bess.
Is Willa around?
I been calling her all morning.
She's not answering her cell.
Well, uh,
she took off with Jim.
I think they went up
to the old cow camp.
Cow camp?
Well, I think
they got cell service
out at the cow camp.
I was 16
when my mama died.
She was stone-gone
when I found her.
Drowned in her own vomit.
She was hooked
on crystal meth.
But that ain't what killed her.
No, it was Jack Mercy,
the day he turned his back
on us.
She was dead
from then on.
So I bury my mom
and I come back here
and I get a job
working for my old man.
Big Jack himself.
Only he doesn't have a clue
who I am.
So you waited.
But then he died so quick
you didn't have time
to finish the business.
He left it all to you,
Lily and Tess
who never even knew him!
Never had to live day by day
cast out
but tied to him
just the same.
Never worked the skin
of their hands off for him.
Looking to have his pride.
When did you start killing?
I killed that cow
just to kill something.
Right here.
Right where Jack Mercy
taught me how to rope a calf.
And then you poisoned my horse?
I watched that man
love his animals
more than his own son.
And Pickles.
I didn't plan on
killing Pickles,
he just happened along.
Bad luck.
And that girl from White Stone,
she was bad luck too?
No.
Just a whore.
Counting on her sex
to get her money.
Not much different than you
and your sisters.
Hey, you know, you kill me
and nobody gets the ranch.
Oh, I'll get it...
or no one will.
Just think of the sport
I'll have in the meantime.
Cute.
BEN:
Jim!
Leave, Ben,
or I'll kill her.
I don't doubt it, Jim.
Ben.
Oh. Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
There he is.
Hey, Nate, looking good.
Ben, good to see you too.
All right.
Hey, Tom. Celine, Leanne.
Here you go, Ham.
Cheers, buddy.
It's almost time,
cowboy.
Isn't she just...
fairy-tale hot?
Yes, she is.
You've probably got
the old and the new
and all of that stuff
but these were
our grandmother's.
Oh, they're beautiful.
They're--
They're perfect.
I figured she'd want you
to have them.
You look so pretty.
Thank you.
I love you.
Can we have some champagne?
Uh,
to the ladies
of Mercy Ranch.
Through rain, snow,
hell and high water
we made it a year.
Yeah, together.
Together.
You know,
Jack Mercy lived his life hard.
And he died the same.
But he gave us a gift.
And it wasn't this ranch.
It was family.
To the best year
of our lives.
LILY:
Cheers.
I can only take a sip.
Why?
It's not good for the baby.
WILLA & TESS:
Baby?
Really?
I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God.
Oh.
Here.
Here,
you have to go.
I can't believe it.
Thank you.
No wonder
she wanted a wedding.
Willa.
What?
You are so damned incredible.
So are you.
Oh, my God,
I hope nobody saw that.
Me too.
Girl, you will never find a band
like this back home.
To hell with L.A.
I stay where the story is.
I told you you were a natural
on the dance floor.
You're pretty much
a natural everywhere.
I think you're gonna have
to marry me, Willa.
I don't see no way around it.
Is that your idea
of a proposal?
You won't get a better one.
Well, where's the ring?
You don't wear rings.
I'll tell you what.
I'll wear yours.
MAN:
Whoo!
