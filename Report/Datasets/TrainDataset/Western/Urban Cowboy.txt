Bud! Your breakfast's
gettin' cold.
- I don't want it, Mamma. I gotta go.
- Oh, all right.
-  Morning.
-  Sit down and eat your breakfast.
- No, I'll just have coffee.
- I made gravy.
- I made biscuits.
- Looks good, but I wanna get goin'.
All right.
Y'all gonna miss me?
Here's some chicken to eat on the road.
And field peas for your Aunt Corene.
You just can't get good vegetables
in Houston now. You'll see.
Good luck, son.
You take care.
Be careful, you hear?
And don't drive too fast.
- Call me the minute you get there.
- I will.
So long, boy.
See you later, Bud!
There's a place
not too far away from here
Out with the cows
and the Lone Star beer
Where the Iivin' is lovely
and it's quite all right with me
Well, they call it Texas,
it's a mighty fine place to be
Runs from Texarkana to El Paso,
and Oklahoma down to old Mexico
And there's Houston, Dallas,
Austin and San Anton'
People in Texas
sure do make you feel at home
They just want everybody
to leave 'em alone
While they drink their whiskey
and roll their own
And they like their music with
a little bit of Southern sound
Kick up their heels every evening
when the sun goes down
You can call 'em country
and they don't care
And if you don't like the way
they wear their hair
You can take your lights
and shove 'em on up the line
Cos people in Texas
don't care if the sun don't shine
Hi, Bud!
Is that you, Lou Sue?
Gimme a hug.
Bob! Bud's here!
Hey, Willie!
-  Bud, how are you doin'?
- Hey, your new house is real nice.
Wait till you see the inside.
How's everybody in Spur?
- I got you!
- You got me.
You're too good!
There you go, darlin'.
I want you to eat some of that.
No? Honestly!
- I hope you're OK sleeping with Willie.
- I hope he's OK sleeping with me.
- I'll get my own place soon as I can.
- Don't worry about it.
- You can stay as long as you want.
- I appreciate it.
- How about some more pie?
- Oh, no. I can't eat no more. I can't.
- Come on. One piece.
- You want me as fat as him?
What's wrong with that?
- Where are you boys goin' tonight?
- To Gilley's.
Oh, goddamn! The place
hasn't changed a bit.
Just keep walking. if they go
to shootin', drop to the ground.
Bud, come on!
If y'all goin' out there to watch,
you have to pay to get back in!
Hell of a fight goin' on out there.
How much do we owe you?
- There's three of us.
- Holy shit!
- This is bigger than my home town.
- The biggest honky-tonk in the world.
Leo! How great to see you!
How are you?
Hey, Bud. There's three and a half acres
of concrete prairie in here.
They've had 7,000 people
in here at one time.
- That right?
- Yeah.
I don't know how many
they've got in here now.
Pretty good crowd, though.
Let's get to the bar and get us a drink.
- Hey, Marshall!
- Bob, how are you?
I want y'all to meet my nephew.
This is Bud. He just got in from Spur.
This is Marshall. Wayne. These boys
work with me at Channel Oil.
- We're gonna take off.
- OK. Talk to you later.
Give us a couple of beers.
Some of that sweet honky-tonk wine
Thank you, everybody, and welcome
to Gilley's. Good to have y'all with us.
Here comes the hurt again
You'd think I'd learn
That's Mickey Gilley himself. He owns
this place with Sherwood Cryer.
The more I get burned
Hey, Steve! Come here.
I want you to meet somebody.
How you doin'?
This is my nephew Bud, from Spur.
Steve. Steve Strange.
Steve and I ran the rodeo circuit
together. He works for Gilley's now.
Hi, Bud. It's nice to meet you.
Hey, Steve, this is Bud's first night
in town. Take care of him, will you?
Hey, girls! Come on over here.
I got somebody I want you to meet.
- Say hi to Bob, Corene and Bud.
- Come on, darlin', let's dance.
Where've you been?
We haven't seen you around here.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Oh... shit.
I'm gonna make you
a nice cup of coffee, darlin'.
That sounds good.
No, Ethel, you can't talk
to your little boy just now.
Because he ain't home.
Must still be at church.
Uh-huh.
-
- Hold on just a minute.
Is that you, Bud?
Uh-oh. Get out the Alka-Seltzer.
Bud, your mamma's on the phone.
I told her you went to church.
Hi, Mamma.
No, I don't have no job yet.
I just got here yesterday.
I... I'm goin' to the plant tomorrow
with Uncle Bob.
Fine. I'll tell you.
Bud Davis, huh?
My... my real name is Buford Uan Davis.
But they don't call me Buford no more,
except my grandma on my dad's side.
She still calls me Buford,
but she's half-Indian.
They call me Bud cos my initials
are B-U-D. Buford Uan Davis.
- It spells "Bud".
- I can spell, boy.
Which pipeline? There ain't one in Spur.
Yes, there is. Came in this spring.
I was workin' on the insulating.
Uncle Bob told me you was hiring,
so I thought I'd come and check it out.
Most of our insulating we contract out.
But I can start you as a general helper.
A flunky, a gofer.
You know what a gofer is, boy?
I think it means, you know,
"go for" things.
Or it could mean you're an animal.
Around here they're on the same level.
Start you at the bottom. You work up.
I wanna tell you one thing. You're gettin'
this job because of your Uncle Bob.
He's been here a long time
and he's a damn good man.
I'll tell you one thing more.
You're gonna have to lose that beard.
It's regulation if you have to wear
any kind of a fresh-air mask.
- Got everything you need?
- Yep.
- Corene sure is gonna be happy.
- Well, I'm gonna do it.
Just gotta go for it, can't hold off.
I better get on back to work.
- All right. I'll see you later.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.
Here goes.
Well, I feel like I've been rode hard
and put up wet
Lord knows last night
was a night I'll never forget
I can't remember what happened
but it must've been the best one yet
Well, I feel like I've been rode hard
and put up wet
Well, I went next door
wearin' nothin' but my underwear
There was Matthew and Billy and
Josh, the whole gang was smashed
And old Robert had a jug
of moonshine from Caroline
Well, I thought I was dead
but they said "Let's sing one more line"
Nothing could be keener
Than to be in Pasadena
In the mo-o-o-orning
See you later.
Hey, Bud!
- How are you doing?
- Fine.
- Anything I can do for you?
- Not yet.
Are you a real cowboy?
That depends on what
you think a real cowboy is.
- The other night you had a beard?
- That's right.
It looked good.
You shouldn't have shaved it.
- Who asked you?
- Nobody.
- Know how to do the two-step?
- You bet.
- Wanna prove it?
- All right.
Now the Indians
are dressin' up like cowboys
And the cowboys
are puttin' leather and turquoise on...
- What's your name?
- Sissy.
- Who are you?
- Bud.
-  Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.
Well, I spent a lifetime
lookin' for you
Single bars and good-time lovers
are never true
Playin' a fool's game, hopin' to win
And tellin' those sweet lies,
and losin' again
I was lookin' for love
in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes, lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Hopin' to find a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover
Another heart
Lookin' for love
- Hey, Marshall.
- Bud.
They got you carrying mud now?
Beats the hell outta cutting foam glass!
- How did you and Sissy make out?
- That ain't none of your business.
- None of my business?
- That's right.
Don't it make you wanna dance?
Don't it make you wanna smile?
When you're down and out
Y'all cut that shit out
or I'll throw you out of the club!
All right! Atta boy. That's my boy.
- Marshall, when'd this thing get here?
- Cryer put it in this afternoon.
Said it might cut down on the fights.
Give all us cowboys something else
to hit besides each other.
This one's for you, darlin'.
Make that needle move, Bud!
Whoo!
- I wanna hit one, Bud.
- Come on, Sissy.
- Hold my beer, Jessie.
- Should I? OK.
Come on, Sissy. You can do it.
Make 600.
-  Doctor Davis.
- Just behave yourself.
Ow! It stings.
You gotta learn
there's certain things a girl can't do.
- Name one.
- I can name several.
Pissin' on the side of a wall.
- Getting laid with your pants still on.
- Why would you want to?
- How do you do that?
- Is it broke?
Shit, no. She couldn't move
her fingers if it was broke. Look.
- It ain't broke.
- I broke my hand in a beer-joint fight.
You really know
when something's broken. You do.
You can't move nothin'.
Your fingers get all swelled up.
Shit.
- Becky! Where's my eggs?
- Hold your horses! It's comin'!
- Hi, Bud.
- Hi, Bud.
- Shit.
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothin'. Why don't you just go on?
- Just cos I was looking at them?
I can't keep my eyes closed.
I just looked up and there they was.
Why don't you just go on? They're
waitin'. Someone else'll take me home.
Come on. You jealous of them?
Little cute girls you're jealous of?
- Don't tickle me.
- Whoo!
- Don't tickle me or I'll wet my pants.
- You love this.
- Ow! You hit me!
- Well, shit! You pinched me.
I don't care.
You're not supposed to hit girls.
- Hey, Sissy...
- I'm not talking to you.
- Where are you goin'?
- Home.
- How you think you're gonna get there?
- I got a thumb. I got a middle finger.
- Come on, Sissy.
- Look, Bud, you hit me!
I didn't hit you that hard!
You don't know what hard is.
- Just leave me alone.
- Fine. Forget it.
"Fine. Forget it."
That's fine with me. See if I care.
Fine.
She still pissed off?
- Get in.
- Go to hell!
- Get in!
- No!
Jesus Christ! I almost hit y'all!
You wanna get married?
Smile, y'all, smile!
- Can you get 'em all in?
- Smile.
-  Uncle Bob! Come here!
- I already been in one.
Oh, nice!
You want me lookin' at the ring
or just showin' it?
- You switch places with me.
- A little more this way. A little tighter.
Can we do one like this?
Like on top of the cake.
Show 'em your garter.
I ain't got no stockings on.
Let me take one.
Now, Sissy, stand still.
And try to look sweet, honey.
My legs are sweatin', Mamma.
First dance to the newlyweds.
- Don't peek.
- OK.
- Bud, I can't stand it. Are we there yet?
- Almost. Just hold on.
I'm gettin' sick to my stomach.
All right. Here we go.
OK, right there. Ready?
On your mark, get set... go.
Argh!
It's ours! I put a down payment on it!
It's ours!
It's 50ft long, 12ft wide, it's got one
bedroom, every modern convenience,
and you can move it if you want!
Where's the keys?
I know we got the keys here.
Here we go! Whoo!
Bud, don't forget your bride. Come on.
Hey, Bud! Has it got a water bed?
And welcome,
ladies and gentlemen,
where all the cowboys
are convicts.
Shit, Bud.
See the guys up there with the rifles?
- See those guys?
- Mm-hm.
-  OK, look at those guys.
- In white? Yeah, they're prisoners, too.
Damn, those outlaws
make good cowboys.
- How come?
- They don't give a shit if they get hurt.
All they do is lay up for a while.
They'd rather do that than anything.
-  Wanna go back to the motel?
- No, I wanna watch the bulls.
-  God, they're so ugly!
- Who's first up?
Wes Hightower.
Let's see what he can do.
- Which number is he?
- 25.
Shit, they're gonna be mean, too.
All right.
Cut him loose!
What happened?
Is he all right?
Goddamn! He's gettin' back on!
I told you he was the roughest and
the toughest. I thought he was a goner!
See, I told you these guys
were tough. Look at that.
That bull looked like he was gonna
go over the wall, but not of his choice.
Who's next?
- Hi, Sissy. How're you doing?
- Good.
- What the hell's goin' on?
- That's Sherwood's new play toy.
- Y'all want a beer?
- Shit, yeah. Give me two Lone Stars.
- Here we go.
- Thank you.
- Marshall, what are you doing?
- Hey, Sissy!
- How are you doing?
- OK.
You ride that thing yet?
Marshall, you ride that thing?
I can't believe it!
Hey, Marshall! Ride the bull!
Shit, no! I'm gonna hang on
to my family jewels!
- Where's your sporting blood?
- It's $2 for eight seconds.
It's what they train rodeo riders on.
It's a bucking machine.
You ride it and I'll watch you.
- Hell, I'll ride it!
- No, you won't!
- First you gotta sign a release.
- And give this lady $2.
He's gonna
bust his ass anyway.
Sign there. In case you bust your ass,
you're not gonna hold Gilley's liable.
Hey, Bud! Come back here a minute.
- You ever rode a bull before?
- No, but I rode some rank horses.
- It's different. Right- or left-handed?
- Right.
- Give him a left glove.
- Oh, it's opposite?
- How the hell do you ride it?
- Put your glove in the rigging,
then put your right nut in your left hand
and hang on!
- Hell, I'm gonna ride again.
- That's the right attitude.
You don't sign the release again.
Just another $2.
- Boy, you got more balls than I got!
- Get your knees up.
Get up close to that rigging as possible.
Give him a ride, Sam!
I was so proud of you, Bud.
You looked so great up on that bull.
You were the best one all night long.
Well, I might have
been the best one all...
..night long, but my
balls are killin' me.
Shit. Oh, man.
Does that mean
we won't be able to do it?
Well, I don't know.
I just don't know.
We'll just have to find out.
I love you so much, Bud.
I love you too, Sissy. Come here.
Sweetheart.
- You know what I really wanna do?
- What?
I wanna ride that bull.
Oh, no. No way!
- Why not?
- It's too dangerous! It ain't for girls.
I gotta watch you. I do!
First you wanna
punch the punchin' bag,
and you're always ridin'
my pick-up and everything.
Now you wanna ride the bull.
- I'm next. I wanna ride it.
- No.
- Jessie rode it.
- I told you no.
- Bud, I think you oughta let her ride.
- I think I told you no.
Bud! Thought you got enough
of this shit last night!
- What speed's it on?
- It's on five tonight.
Five? That's high, ain't it?
Look at Gator. He's shitfaced.
All right, let's go!
Stay on, Gator!
- I'm gonna ride again.
- You can't ride again.
Well, I am.
- Bud, it's my turn.
-  It's Big C's turn.
- One more time.
- Everybody's waitin' in line. Real nice.
Hey, I wanna ride.
Hello, Steve.
Wes. How're you doin'?
Long time no see.
Bet you ten bucks
you can't throw me.
I can't do any gambling
around the bull area here, Wes.
Come on.
- Ten bucks.
- All right.
- What speed you got it on?
- It's on five. Get your ass up there.
- I'll turn it up.
- Go ahead.
- Steve, who is that guy?
- Just somebody I used to know, Bud.
He sure does look familiar.
- Hey, who is this guy?
- I don't know. I never seen him before.
Looks like his shirt's made
out of his mamma's hairnet.
- What's he doin'?
- Maybe he's lookin' up the bull's ass.
He's turnin' it up.
I don't care if he does look squirrelly.
He brought his own glove with him.
Look, he's playin' with himself!
Go on, mister! Ride that thing!
Ready, Wes?
Hey, ride that thing!
Damn! He's good.
Hell of a ride!
Good ride! OK, now it's my turn, Steve.
Can't, Sissy. Gilley's fixin' to do a set
and he don't like the bull running.
You're a real cowboy, ain't you?
- Come on, let's dance.
- I'll see you in a bit, Sissy.
Come on, Wes. Let's get a beer.
- Quit that flirtin'.
- I wasn't.
Was too.
Hoedown!
My best friend and his woman
Have been fighting now for weeks
They finally chose to keep the peace
They decided not to speak
Now she won't say a word to him...
- Just do it for me.
- Ask me how to become a bull rider.
In the afternoon? That's how I'm gonna
ride it. I'm gonna go in the afternoon.
-  You jealous of her?
- I'm notjealous. Are you sore?
Ooh!
You better not tell Bud, Marshall.
- What's it worth?
- I wanna surprise him.
Becky! You tell that son of a bitch
to put extra onion on that. All right?
- I want it extra well, too.
- OK.
- If it's not, I'm sending it back.
- OK.
- OK, I got it.
- He's got it. What you got?
- A joke.
- You gonna give it to me?
- Ask me how you become a bull rider.
- How do you become a bull rider?
- That was good, Marshall.
- All right.
- You get a handful of marbles.
- OK.
Get a handful of marbles,
you put them in your mouth, OK?
Then you go to Gilley's
and ride that bull.
Every time you ride that bull, you take
one of them marbles and spit it out.
- You're drunk.
- Isn't he cute?
OK. And when you've lost all your
marbles, that's when you're a bull rider.
Oh, shit!
That's a good one.
Don't worry about anything.
I'm sorry I didn't get to Cryer,
but I'll get to him
first thing in the morning.
Let's get that burger.
What the hell was that?
What's he tippin' his hat at you for?
Don't he know we're married?
Hey, Tattoo! Lookee here! See this?
That's a weddin' ring.
That means we're married. She's mine.
- Don't be an asshole!
- OK?
- All right, loosen up.
- See that? He slipped me the finger.
- Would you calm down?
-  I didn't see him.
Just calm down, Bud.
- Here's your food.
- Burger, extra onion. Ham and eggs.
Cheese omelette.
Oh, and the chilli of yours is coming.
- This thing's still movin'.
- I can't help it.
Well, then, put it back on the fire!
Bud, don't do this. It's stupid.
Don't fight him.
You're drunker than Cooter Brown.
- Are you listening at all?
-Will you shut up? I mean it!
OK, fine!
- Stop it!
-  Let's get that burger now.
Get him, Bud!
Goddammit! Bud, don't!
Get outta here!
Hold on.
Hold on a second.
Sissy, take him home.
Bud, it's seven o'clock.
If you're not goin' in to work,
I'll call you in sick.
- Brought you some coffee.
- Get me a beer.
- If they smell beer on your breath...
- Just get me a beer!
Yes, sir.
Sweetheart, are you sure
you're OK to go to work?
- Hi, Daddy.
- Morning, honey.
If it's OK, I wanna get off early today.
That's all right with me,
if your mother don't mind.
- Ma, I wanna get off early today, OK?
- It's OK with me if it's OK with him.
Guess it's OK.
- Better eat something. You'll get sick.
- No, I'll be all right.
- Hi, Marshalene.
- Hi, Sissy.
Fine. You're ridin' fine.
- Hi, y'all.
- Hi, Sissy.
- Hi, Sissy.
-  Remember Wes?
He's livin' out back. Workin' here.
Gonna help me run the bull.
Get on up and take a ride.
OK.
Push, lift. Push, lift.
All right. Turn
loose with that hand.
Turn loose with it.
Turn loose with it. All right.
Now stick it up in the air.
- Up behind you. Turn your arm.
-  Come on. Don't be scared.
Hey, David.
Send me down some more mud.
OK.
Good God Almighty!
Bud!
Bud!
- Ma'am, you are good!
-  What are you grinnin' at?
Turn to the left. Hit it. In the well.
Get that arm back. You look fine.
You're a bull rider, child!
Don't move, Bud! Don't move!
Arch your back, arch your back.
Hang on, Bud.
Hang on.
- I can't take it!
- Stop it!
Take it easy. You'll be all right.
We'll get you down.
You'll be all right.
I'm gonna go get the crane.
- How long you been married?
- Not very long at all.
- How long?
- I don't know. About a week, I guess.
All right. Just pretend
like you're still on your honeymoon.
- Hi. Bob told me what happened.
- Well, come on in.
- I came to check on you.
- Can I get you a drink?
Shoot, no, darlin'.
- How are you?
- Fine. They've given me this codeine.
Yeah?
- Where's Sissy? ls she at work?
- Oh, Sissy. I'd better call her.
If she finds out from somebody else
but me, she'll probably get worried.
My God, Bud. Y'all live like pigs.
What's the matter?
Nothin' much.
He just almost got himself killed.
- Killed?
- That's right.
- Where is he?
- He's in the tub.
Bud?
- Bud, what happened?
- I fell off the scaffold.
- You're kiddin'.
- No. 200 feet in the air.
Damn near broke my back.
Where you been?
I was with Jessie.
I guess I forgot the time. You OK?
Bud? Listen, darlin', I'm gonna
go home now that Sissy's here. OK?
I couldn't get to this bathroom.
Maybe Sissy can.
Don't worry about that.
I put some tuna salads
in the icebox for y'all, OK?
If you need anything else, just call.
You know where we are.
Bye-bye, Sissy.
Get me another beer.
I gotta soak longer.
OK.
What was you and Jessie up to?
I thought you didn't like her.
Jessie's all right. Just girl talk.
I like my tuna salad
when it has pecans and apple,
not so much of this onion.
We don't have no pecans and apples
cos you ain't been shoppin'.
Corene asked me what I wanted.
I said corn bread.
- She couldn't even find any instant.
- Don't complain against me, Bud.
There's certain things
a man wants from his wife.
Like to be here when he gets home and
to cook once in a while and clean up.
Make good love to him.
Look, I know that's good, OK?
But that ain't enough.
I just thought we'd go to McDonald's.
- Goddammit! McDonald's again?!
- I work, too!
You're making out like
I have nothing to do all day!
That's what I told her! I said
you worked! She said we live like pigs!
She said that?
Look, I don't wanna fight with you.
Well, I don't wanna fight either.
Wanna go to Gilley's tonight?
No.
Come here. Come here.
Come on, let's go to Gilley's.
It'll make us feel better.
- OK.
- Go get dressed.
- Eat your tuna with the onions.
- Clean up, pig!
What the hell's he doin'
workin' the bull?
- Steve gave him a job.
- How do you know that?
- Jessie told me this afternoon.
- Sissy, come here!
See you.
How are you doin'?
- I think you oughta ride.
- I can't. I got blisters on my ass.
- Bud! How you feeling?
- All right.
- How's that foot?
- It's my back that's killing me.
- You scared the dickens out of us, boy.
- I thought I was a goner.
- I ain't no chickenshit.
- Well, get your ass up there.
- Wes, what's it on?
- Eight. I'll turn it down.
OK. I'm gonna ride.
- Sure looks like he's feelin' good now.
- I'm on codeine. I don't feel a thing.
- Girl on the bull!
- At least she won't hurt her balls!
- There's gonna be a bull on a girl.
- Hear what they're sayin'?
Look up there.
Bud, d'you recognise her?
Hey, Sissy! Get down from there!
- Bud, just watch, OK?
-  Right now!
She knows what she's doin'.
Remember, keep your hand in the well.
Don't think about nothin' but the ride.
-  Show 'em how to do it, girl.
- OK.
Turn that girl loose!
Shit, Bud! She rides better than you do!
- I wanted to show you I could ride it.
- You lied to me.
I didn't lie. For Christ's sake,
I just wanted to ride the goddamn bull!
OK, Tattoo. Let's see what you can do.
- Jessie, turn it up!
- You can't ride that with your back!
- Shut up!
- OK, you're gonna hurt yourself.
- Be careful, Bud.
-  I swear to God, take it easy.
Shit!
- That was a good ride.
- Now ride it.
- I don't want to.
- Ride it!
- Leave her alone, Bud.
- Back off, Jessie! Ride it!
OK.
That make you happy?
Don't ride it again. Please?
Please don't ride it. You'll hurt yourself.
- I'm gonna smack his ass this time.
- Take it easy.
The bull's too fast. Easy!
- You gotta stop him!
- Don't let this shit go too far.
I've got him now.
Bud!
You broke my goddamn arm!
Wes, you shit!
Come on! Out the door!
- You layin' him?
- I ain't layin' him.
You lied to me.
I was with Jessie.
I just didn't say where.
My daddy told me if a woman'll lie about
one thing, she'll lie about another.
- Bud, just take off your shirt.
- Get away from me!
I don't need your help
and I don't want your help.
I don't want you showin' off on that bull.
- I wasn't showin' off!
- What the hell do you call it, then?
- I call it riding it.
- Oh, just riding it, huh?
That's right. And I'm gonna ride it again,
as much as I want to!
- You think you are, but you ain't.
- You're not my daddy!
I'm the next best thing - your husband.
You ain't never riding it, ever!
I think you're jealous
cos I ride it better.
- I'm what?
- Bud!
You hit me!
Cut it out! Stop it!
- Come on! Get out!
- Where am I gonna go?!
Go see your daddy!
You like him better!
- Here! Take your keys!
- Fine!
Goddammit!
I'll be up front. I'm better with one arm
than most of your guys are with two.
I'll guarantee that.
I'm sorry, Bud. There's not much
you can do here with a broken arm.
And you're still on a probation period.
I can't keep you on a salary.
Come back when the cast is off
and I'll put you back to work.
Here's your severance pay.
And I am sorry, Bud.
Thank you.
Don't touch my
heart any more
And the moon just turned blue,
goodbye, goodbye
And my heart won't
die from this
But the moon just turned blue,
goodbye, goodbye
Bud, don't start no shit in here.
She oughta be able to hang on
with those thunder thighs.
- Ever done this before?
- No.
Don't worry, honey. Anything
he makes sore, I'll be glad to kiss.
I'll get y'all more beer.
Sissy! Just listen to me. Now, look,
that guy's an escaped convict.
- He is not.
- He's in the prison rodeo programme.
- That guy's a convict.
- He's out on parole.
- Wait a minute. You knew that?
- He told me today. I ain't talking to you.
Fine. I'll find somebody else
who will talk to me.
- Fine. Good luck.
- Good.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
Gilley's, the world's largest nightclub.
Wanna dance?
Sure. Why not?
- You all right?
- No.
Can I help?
- Wanna dance?
- Why, sure.
OK.
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long
As you stand by me
Darling, stand by me
Won't you stand by me?
if you're in need
Won't you stand, stand by me?
And if the sky we look upon
Should ever crumble and fall
And the mountains
should fall to the sea
No, I won't be afraid
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long,
just as long as you stand by me
Darling, stand by me
Won't you stand by me?
if you've a need,
won't you stand, stand by me?
So when are you gonna
take me home and rape me?
- Whenever you get ready.
- I'm ready right now.
Come on.
I gotta tell my girlfriends
I'm goin'.
Got myself a cowboy.
See y'all later.
Bud!
Bud! Bud, where are you goin'?
You bitch!
Who's that?!
My wife.
Hey, what's your problem?
- What's your name?
- Bud.
Mine's Pam.
- Well, where are we goin', Pam?
- Uptown.
Hey, cowboy. You're not just doin' this
to make your wife jealous, are you?
Yep.
I have a thing about cowboys.
Just drives my daddy crazy.
He can't understand it.
I told him "Daddy, most men today
are just too complicated."
Daddy goes to an analyst three times
a week. I like men with simple values.
I like them independent,
self-reliant,
brave, strong,
direct and open.
"You mean dumb" he says.
Daddy's a real scream.
There's plenty of whiskey.
Pour me some bourbon.
I'm gonna put some music on.
What does your daddy do?
Daddy does oil.
And all that that implies.
- You come to Houston proper much?
- No.
It's my favourite city
in the whole world.
It's just got so much energy.
This could take us
all night long
I looked at the moon and
I felt blue
To cowboys.
And all that that implies.
Now I will spend
the whole night through
Come on. I wanna show you something.
This stuff is called Mezcal con gusano,
which means "Mezcal with worm".
- It's got a worm in there?
- Yeah. A little worm floatin' around.
It's sickening.
The Mexicans say if you eat the worm,
you're gonna see visions.
- Visions of what?
- I don't know.
I ate a whole mess of 'em and I never
seen a vision yet, but I sure feel good.
Well, what's that to?
OK.
You rob banks, huh?
I mean, Steve told me that.
How many banks you rob?
I don't really care how many
banks you robbed, but why?
- Come here.
- I am right here. It's so small.
No, you ain't. Come here.
OK.
Come here.
OK.
This is my favourite thing.
See, the thing is, I can't
do this to Bud.
But I really appreciate
that thing with the worm.
I thought I could, but I can't.
I really loved that worm
and all that.
He lost his pride and a whole lots
besides, and she just don't give a damn
I guess that's what you get
for fallin' in love for the night
Wes?
Hi, cowboy.
It didn't take much to find you.
I just called Gilley's.
One of the girls who works in the office
said she'd been here a couple of times.
Thought I'd come.
Make your wife jealous again.
Well, my wife is livin'
in a trailer outside Gilley's
with an ex-convict.
And I'm gettin' a divorce.
Shit.
Hello?
Hi, Uncle Bob.
Yeah. No, that's all right.
No, I got company.
No, it ain't Sissy.
Well, no, we're not really hungry, but...
Well, that sounds good.
Hold on. I'll ask her.
It's my Uncle Bob. My Aunt Corene
just made a homemade Karo nut pie,
and we'll go over for dessert.
We'd love to.
Well, at least a couple of hours.
All right, see you then. Bye.
This pie is so good.
Corene found this while she was goin'
through some old boxes the other day.
I won that for bull-ridin' in '64.
I didn't know you won first place.
Look at that.
You'd have been better than
Larry Mahan, if not for that accident.
- He was in hospital for nearly a year.
- I fell off and the bull stomped me.
I got a plastic bone in my leg and
a plastic plate up here in my head.
- How well d'you know this pretty lady?
- Go ahead. Tell her.
One plastic nut.
He bullshits a lot,
but he's tellin' the truth.
We're goin' to Gilley's tonight. Be
the first time since we took you there.
- Y'all come with us.
- Why? What's happenin' out there?
They are having
a Dolly Parton lookalike contest.
Whoo! Lord have mercy!
Evening, ladies and gentlemen.
These are our Dolly Parton lookalikes.
Now we give you
a chance to meet our finalists.
- I'm Judith Hanson.
- Trina Haynes.
- Judy Manuelle.
- Kim Kimmons.
Hi. I'm Chrystal Smith.
- Hi. I'm Marshalene Mitchell.
- Hi. I'm Sandra Carmush.
- Hi. I'm Louise Winter.
- Hi. I'm Jerry Hopkins.
- Hi, y'all. I'm Mary Bailey.
- Big round of applause for our finalists!
Now could we have
the decision from our judges?
Thank you.
Miss Sandra Carmush!
Eat your heart out.
Congratulations! Ain't she a Dolly?
For all you shitkickers out there,
it's rodeo time again here at Gilley's.
And we're gonna have
our own indoor rodeo back there.
That's just three weeks from tonight.
We're gonna have a bull-riding contest,
a punching-bag contest
and a dancing contest.
For all you guys that wanna ride
that mechanical bull,
we got a table set up for all you guys
that wanna join, or even you cowgirls.
The entry forms are back there.
It's $10 per person, per event.
So join up
and have a good time with us.
Right now we're gonna have
a little music. "Cotton-Eyed Joe"!
I really wanted to win.
You were the prettiest one there!
Let's go and look at that machine.
I wanna see what kind of machine it is.
-  What d'you say?
-  Bullshit!
- Stepped in what?
-  Bullshit!
- Smelt like what?
-  Bullshit!
-  You wanna ride this thing?
- Yeah.
It's just an old El Toro.
I trained on one when I was rodeoin'.
Real good, Norman.
- I wanna ride it.
- All right. Come on.
Look at that.
Her nipples are hard!
- Come on, Sissy! Do your stuff!
- She ain't got no glove on.
She don't need one for this.
Hell, she rides better
without a glove than I do with one.
That's better
than a vibrator, ain't it?
All right! Come on, Sissy! Go!
Come on!
She's all right, I guess. I've seen better.
Come on, Sissy! Go!
Let's go. Come on, let's go.
You sure made Bud jealous.
Listen, y'all, I think maybe
we better call it a night.
Hell, no! I'm just ready to party. Let's
go to that place you was talkin' about.
- Elan's?
- I can't go anyplace dressed like this!
- She can go like that, can't she?
- I know a place where it won't matter.
What the hell!
Pop them titties and let's get rollin'.
All right. Here goes!
- Hey, Carol!
- Hi, Pam. How you doin'?
- Hello, Pam.
- Hey, Earl.
Could you help me ride that buck?
Good enough to kick ass in that rodeo?
Why. hell, yeah!
There used to be a machine at the
Circle Eight I trained on for rodeoin'.
- Think we could use it?
- I imagine.
How long you think it'd be
till I get good enough to win?
- When's that cast comin' off?
- Next week.
- Let's go out tomorrow and look at it.
- Hell, yes!
All right!
- Three Jack Daniel's!
- Two. I'm having bourbon and Coke.
Sure is good to see you again
Hello, Texas
Sure is good to see me a friend
You know, we ain't knockin'
the rest of the country
You know we really think they're great
Just seems I left part of my heart
Somewhere in the Lone Star State
You know, we ain't knockin'
the rest of the country
You know we really think it's great
Just seems I left part of my heart
Somewhere in the Lone Star State
Bud, in some ways, a bull like this
is harder to ride than a real one.
With a real one, you can watch his head
and see which way he's apt to move.
With one of these, the treachery of the
bull depends on the man operating it.
If you wanna ride it right,
you gotta learn style and form,
because you're competing against real
bull riders, not just mechanical ones.
I can tell you how to score points.
I can't show you because I'm too fat!
If you listen to me, you can win.
if you don't, you won't. OK?
Bud?
Bud?
That's it! Yeah! Keep kicking!
That's what you're gonna be
judged on - your style.
Good! Good! Yeah!
You gotta do more than stay on
to win a rodeo. You gotta have flair!
- Kick it! Keep that hand up!
- That's better?
"Dear Bud,
sorry about last night. "
"I was kind of drunk...
Well, I was drunk. "
"I woke up feelin' awful
about life and other stuff. "
"I didn't even mind
cleanin' up much. "
"I didn't even mind
cleanin' up... much. "
"if you want to call me,
I'll wait at Gilley's all afternoon."
"Love, your not-yet-ex-wife,
Sissy."
"PS... "
"PS... "
Bud?
- I was just leavin'.
- Good.
Hi. How'd you get in?
The door was open.
What did you do?
Damn! You cleaned up the place.
All right!
The bathroom, bedroom.
Flowers!
This is great! I just love
a woman's touch around the house.
I mean it.
What are you doing
with yourself now?
Doc told me this cast
could come off first of the week.
Thought I'd take it off a day early.
Save some money.
Look, I ain't got
your kind of money, right?
Every little bit helps.
Uncle Bob told me if I work a double
shift, I can make up to $16 an hour.
How d'you like that? Ooh, turn that up.
That's my favourite song.
I didn't realise you made
so much at the plant.
Hell, yeah. How come you think
I came to Houston? For my health?
What you do is this: come to Houston,
make some extra money,
then you go back home
and get yourself a piece of land.
Course, with the high cost
of livin' and...
all the things I've been through lately,
I haven't been able to save a dime.
Pam? I said turn it up.
I can't hardly hear it.
- What are you doin'?
- Nothin'. Just listenin'.
I never met a cowboy who didn't talk
about going back to the country.
Yeah, well, I guess
it's all bullshit anyway, huh?
Course, if I won that rodeo,
it could all come true.
Bud?
What?
I'm gonna bring some clothes here
and stay with you for a while.
You need a woman
to take care of you. All right?
Suit yourself.
Marshalene?
Bud still hasn't called, huh?
No, he hasn't.
I'm gonna go back inside,
so you know where I am.
OK.
Mammas, don't let your babies
grow up to be cowboys...
Don't let 'em pick guitars
and drive them old trucks
Make 'em be doctors
and lawyers and such
Mammas, don't let your babies
grow up to be cowboys...
Hey, Bud!
Want somethin' to eat? Drink?
OK.
Cowboys love smoky old pool rooms
and clear mountain mornings
Little warm puppies and children
and girls of the night
Them that don't know him
won't like him
And them that do
sometimes won't know how to take him
But his pride won't let him do things
to make you think he's right
Mammas, don't let your babies
grow up to be cowboys
He'll never stay home
and he's always alone
- Whoo! Damn good! Damn good, Bud!
- Thanks, Dwight.
Now go out and hang around Gilley's
and watch that fellow run that bull.
That sounds like a good idea.
Wes?
Home a little early, ain't you?
No.
Marshalene was just leavin'.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry, Sissy.
- Don't matter. See you later.
You can't expect a man like me
to be faithful to any woman.
You buy cigarettes?
Pick it up.
Pick it up yourself.
No!
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Thank you.
Fix me something to eat.
Fix it yourself.
Fix me somethin' to eat!
Gonna storm.
- Howdy.
- Hi.
- Where you been?
- Circle Eight with Uncle Bob.
Rode that bull up to ten today.
- What's that? It smells good.
- Stroganoff.
There's a party later tonight at Cowboy
for some friends of mine.
My daddy might 9°-
You go on ahead. I'm gonna work
the graveyard shift tonight.
Again?
Pays time and a half. I've got to.
I'm gonna take a nap.
Wake me up in an hour and a half.
I'm goin' to watch
that son of a bitch run that bull.
And then I'm goin' right to work,
so don't forget.
- Aren't you hungry?
- No. I'll eat when I get up.
I don't want you to go
to Gilley's without me.
I gotta watch the man's technique.
I'll just go to Cowboy later.
You don't care if I go to the party?
You won't be jealous?
Nope.
Not even a little?
Look, I hope I learned a lesson
about being jealous from Sissy.
I hope I'm the kind of a man
who can learn from experience.
Not everybody does.
Contrary to what you or your daddy
think, all cowboys ain't dumb.
Some of them got the smarts
real good. Like me.
I'm sure.
- What have you done now?
- What are you talkin' about?
You bought me another shirt.
You are crazy, girl!
I had that one made
for you, sweetheart.
Thank you. It's real nice.
Uncle Bob!
- Hey, Bud!
- How you feelin'?
Real good. You stop off at Gilley's
on the way over here?
No. I wanted to, but Pam
didn't wake me up on time.
I was so goddamn mad, I tell you.
I guess she just don't want me
bein' where Sissy is or somethin'.
Oh, yeah.
- I saw Sissy today.
- Oh, yeah?
- What did she say?
- Well, not very much.
She gave me the finger.
I gave her the finger.
Well... I guess it's over. I don't know.
You know, Bud, sometimes even
a cowboy's gotta swallow his pride
and hold on to somebody he loves.
- What do you mean?
- Hell, I know.
I pretty near lost Corene and the kids
a couple of times just cos of pride.
You think that old pride is gonna
choke you goin' down but, I tell you,
ain't a night goes by I don't thank the
Boss for givin' me a big enough throat.
Without Corene and them kids, I'd just
be a pile of shit in a cantaloupe patch,
just drawin' flies!
- I guess so.
- Think about it, Bud.
Pride's one of them seven deadlies,
you know what I mean?
- Bob?
-Yes, sir?
- Check 309 and gauge it for me.
- You betcha!
Thanks, partner.
You boys go and help Bud.
What are you guys doin' here?
- Freezin', Bud!
- Come to help me?
They called a bunch of us out.
Said it's gonna rain tonight.
That's good, cos I thought I was
gonna do this all alone. Help me.
Goddamn! I hate that lightning!
Mudder, four inch by ninety.
Whoa! Shit!
- Uncle Bob!
- Get the hell outta there!
- Bud!
- Get down!
- Move back!
- Get outta here! Go on!
Get back!
Get him back!
Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me...
Let us pray.
Our Father, which art in Heaven,
Hallowed be thy name,
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,
On earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
And forgive us our trespasses,
As we forgive those
who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation,
Deliver us from evil,
For thine is the kingdom,
The power and the glory,
For ever and ever. Amen.
..tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling "Oh, sinner, come home"
Thank you, pallbearers.
Take your boutonnieres
and place them on the casket.
Oh, Aunt Corene.
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Nobody called me or nothin'.
- Thanks so much for coming.
- I loved Uncle Bob.
- I know you did, darlin'.
- Bob loved you, too. You know that.
- Come on, Mamma.
Take care.
- Thanks for coming.
- He was my uncle, too.
I mean, he still is by marriage.
Our divorce ain't final yet.
I just... you know, I wasn't able
to get to the papers, so...
Doesn't matter.
Uncle Bob really wanted
you to be happy. You happy?
Hell, yes, I'm happy.
How about you? You happy?
Shit. Yeah, I really am.
I finally got what I wanted.
I got a real cowboy.
I got what I wanted, too.
I got myself a real lady.
- Bud, the family car is waiting.
- Family car is waitin'.
I ain't gonna be here after tonight.
Wes... There just ain't much life
for us here, and he can't get a job.
He's gonna win that rodeo tonight.
We're gonna take off.
That sounds real good.
'Cept how's he plannin' to win
the rodeo when he's runnin' the bull?
He ain't. Sherwood fired his ass
cos he's hurtin' too many people.
Purse is up to $5,000. Wes says
that'll get us deep into Mexico.
- Don't suppose you'll be there tonight.
- No.
No.
Bye. y'all.
Bye, Pam.
I've got somethin' for you, darlin'.
Bob told me just last Monday night,
just right before he went to bed that...
he wanted you to have this and to wear
it tonight at the rodeo, for good luck.
Well, I ain't goin' to the rodeo tonight.
I don't feel like I can.
Please take it, Bob... Bud!
Listen to that.
You take that.
You take it tonight for good luck.
Oh, I'll take it. I'd be proud to own it.
But not for tonight, not for good luck.
You know... Bob kind of forgot about
his rodeo days till you come along.
And... he even forgot
where he put that belt buckle.
- I had a hell of a time findin' it.
- I bet you did.
Now that it's turned up again,
I don't want it retired.
I wanna give it to somebody
who's gonna use it.
The Devil went down to Georgia,
he was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind cos he was
way behind and willin' to make a deal
When he came across this young man
sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped up and said
"Boy, let me tell you what"
"I guess you didn't know it,
but I'm a fiddle player too"
"And if you'd care to take a dare,
I'll make a bet with you"
"You play a pretty good fiddle, boy,
but give the Devil his due"
"I bet a fiddle of gold against your
soul cos I think I'm better than you"
The boy said "My name's Johnny
and it might be a sin"
"But I'll take your bet, you'll regret,
cos I'm the best there's ever been"
Johnny, rosin up your bow
and play your fiddle hard
Cos hell's broke loose in Georgia
and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win, you'll get
this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose,
the Devil gets your soul
The Devil opened up his case
and he said "I'll start this show"
Fire flew from his fingertips
as he rosined up his bow
He pulled the bow across the strings
and it made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in
and it sounded somethin' like this
When the Devil finished, Johnny said
"You're pretty good, old son"
"But sit down in that chair
and let me show you how it's done"
Fire on the mountain,
run, boys, run
The Devil's in the house
of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan
pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite?
No, child, no
All right. Welcome to Gilley's rodeo!
We got a couple of clowns here.
Couple of real funny bones.
Give them a hand, too.
All right? Yeah! OK!
Folks, this rodeo is gonna be run just
like any rodeo right across this country.
The same way.
Now, each judge is gonna give
for a combined possible score
of 100 points.
Now, the five top contestants are gonna
compete in the short go-round,
and we're gonna combine the scores
on this ride and that ride,
and out of that we're gonna have
the winner of that $5,000 jackpot!
Tonight the bull is wild!
Turned all the way up to 12.
Let's have that first contestant
up there: Howard Heston.
Oh! Uh-oh.
Sorry about that, Howard. You bet.
Next contestant, ladies and gentlemen:
number 155, the Great Tanker.
All right, Tank. You ready?
Hit him, Sam!
Pin that on me.
That's it! He made that eight seconds
look good, didn't he, folks?
You betcha.
Let's look at that score.
Hey! Look at that now! All right!
All right. Thank goodness
for the clowns.
Number 144, folks! This is JR Fisk.
All right! Yeah!
You ready, JR? He's ready.
Give him a ride, Sam.
They want everybody
to leave 'em alone
While they drink their whiskey
and roll their own
And they like their music
with a little bit of Southern sound
Kick up their heels every evening
when the sun goes down
You can call 'em country
and they don't care
if you don't like the way
they wear their hair
You can take your lights
and shove 'em on up the line
Cos people in Texas
don't care if the sun don't shine
Hell. Some gotta win
and some gotta lose.
If the bull don't kill him,
the clowns will!
Hey. You came out after all, huh?
- Bud, sorry to hear about your uncle.
- Thank you.
Good luck tonight.
Next contestant: number 106,
Mr Wes Hightower.
Let's take a look at that score here.
- That was good.
- It was all right.
An 81! All right!
That there's the highest score tonight!
- That was a pussy ride you gave me.
- Why don't you take it up with Sam?
All right. Next rider here: number 48.
Next contestant: Bud Davis.
Hit him, Sam!
-
- All right!
That was a fabulous bull ride
by Bud Davis, number 87.
Now, let's take a look at that score.
A 79! Well, all right!
That puts Bud Davis in the top five.
Boy's been practising.
All right, everybody, we're down to our
five finalists in our bull-riding contest.
How about a good, big
round of applause for 'em?
We're also down to our six finalists
in our dance contest.
Now that the dancers have caught
their breath, the big finale!
Here's the Charlie Daniels Band!
- When did you say I was up?
- You're gonna be in fifth position.
You'll be our final rider.
We put everybody's name in a hat,
drew positions for the short go-round.
Gives everybody the same shot.
Right! All right! A nice round
of applause for Gene McLaughlin.
All right. Here we are now.
We're down to the five finalists,
and let's get on with it.
Lloyd Smith, number 57.
Lloyd had a 75
on the first go-round, folks.
Let's move him out.

Welcome! Good to have all you folks
at Gilley's annual rodeo.
At this time I would like to announce
the winners of all three big events.
First of all, I want to introduce
the judges of our dance contest.
Becky Tiller and the top DJ...
Do you think Sissy left?
I know she did.
She went out the side door.
Shit! I wanted her to see this.
That would have been perfect. Perfect.
The punching-bag event,
the strong man of the bunch:
Norman Tucker!
Congratulations, Norman!
Now for the really big event.
The gentleman that outrode
everybody on our famous bull,
the one and only... Bud Davis!
Congratulations to Bud!
Back to that good country music.
The Charlie Daniels Band,
"The Orange Blossom Special"!
We'd better go. I don't wanna leave
Aunt Corene alone too long.
- You did it for her, didn't you?
- What?
Practising. Winning. All that.
- Didn't you?
- What are you talkin' about?
Cos you sure didn't do it for me.
Pam, this ain't no time
to start this with me.
What are you talkin' about?
Look, I'm a shit.
But I'm not that big a shit.
I have to tell you something.
Remember when you came back and
the trailer was clean, flowers around?
- Yep.
- I didn't do that.
Sissy did it. She was there.
She left you a note
asking you to phone her.
But I tore it up
cos I was sort of jealous.
I wanted to keep my cowboy.
You don't love me, Bud.
And I don't really love you.
Not like that.
So you shouldn't let her get away.
But I tell you what.
If you ever wanna make her jealous,
you know where I am.
Sissy!
Sissy?
Get outta here, Bud. I mean it!
- I gotta talk to you.
- Wes is in Gilley's and we're leavin'.
I know you're leavin',
but I just wanted to tell you somethin'.
I'm hard-headed, and I'm prideful.
And I wanna apologise clear back to
when I hit you the first time.
I love you, Sissy.
I love you, too, Bud!
- You do?
- Mm-hm.
I didn't know you came
to the trailer that day.
If I'd known that, I'd have called you.
But she tore up that note.
- Shit, you can ride that bull anytime.
- I don't wanna ride it!
And screw Mexico because
we can do anythin' we want! I got...
- What happened to your face?
- I got hit.
Did he hit you?
Goddamn, I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!
Bud, just leave him alone! Bud!
Wes, what's goin' on?
Oh, shit.
All right! Check that office!
Peter, pick up the money here,
would you?
- Sam, the door's locked!
- Good job, Bud!
Bud, I swear I didn't know
about any of that. I swear.
- Keep that gun on him, Steve.
- See what he did with the keys?
- He threw them in the garbage can.
- I know where you live.
Hey, Bud, you put it
on his ass pretty good!
Y'all get back in the club.
It's all over with.
Let's go! Get back in the club.
- Come on, Bud. I'll buy you a beer.
- No way! We're goin' home. Come on.
Hey! You sure?
- Hell, I'll buy you two beers!
- Jessie, take care of my car, OK?
Don't worry about it, Sissy!
Single bars and good-time lovers
are never true
Playin' a fool's game,
hopin' to win
And tellin' those sweet lies,
and Iosin' again
I was lookin' for love
in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love
in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes,
lookin' for traces
Hopin' to find a
friend and a lover
I'll bless the day
I discover
Damn!
And! was alone then,
no love in sight
And! did everything I could
to get me through the night
Don't know where it started
or where it might end
I'd turn to a stranger
just like a friend
I was lookin' for love
in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in
too many faces
Searchin' their eyes,
lookin' for traces
Hopin' to find a
friend and a lover
I'll bless the day
I discover
You came a-knockin'
at my heart's door
You're everything I've
been lookin' for
No more lookin' for love
in all the wrong places
Now that I've found
a friend and a lover
Searchin' their eyes,
lookin' for traces
Now that I've found
a friend and a lover
I bless the day
I discovered you
Searchin' their eyes,
lookin' for traces
Now that I've found
a friend and a lover
I bless the day
I discovered you
