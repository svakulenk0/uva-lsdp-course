How long?
One hour.
What will they do with us?
Well-Be calm.
Mrs. Butler gives the map
The bandits then we are free.
Stay with them from the neighborhood
and do not speak with them.
Understood? If they try
to onbnappen, popping them down.
An hour to produce.
Hebjij nice friends.
There is only one solution:
we must liberate them.
That would be madness.
That is better than doing nothing.
-Not always.
Watch helps too.
-There 's nothing else on.
The gang sees everything we do.
-No, you know.
What do you mean by that?
That will ikje-show.
Here is the water.
Strekje arm.
My husband wanted an emergency exit

The entrance is 30 cm

In the near their camp.
Then, we know enough.
Good luck, Fred.
Do you see anything?
-No, it's quiet there.
Everything is ready.
Tie-ahead.
We have blankets needed.
Role-them here.
Leave him here but lie.
-Good.
Make it as another one of those.
Isn 't powder dry?
Yes, but we need more.
-Please.
Our colonel is very cunning.
I'm curious
what he intends.
Why does Mrs. Butler

Love you still.
You can not talk.
Why not give them the card?
-That 's all I know.
Zieje them all?
They must now surely are.
Well, they are not.
Take a look.

Go back or I shoot.
-Well, I go al
You guys are all mad as a hatter.
Do not move.
Give me 's what.

Gentlemen, now he is gone.
Go-itself but also quick.
I should science.
And what do you?
Go away, I said.
Threatens me-you sometimes?
I count to three.
-Good. One, with three.
Still a hole in my hat.
You are very slechtgemanierd.
Well, I already district 's violence.
Herakles come, we go.
The hour is over.
Remove the prisoners.
Do you see anything, Mrs. Butler?
-No, nothing.
O God, as they are discovered ...
This time they won,
if I am not mistaken.
Where are they?
Where? Where?
Put everything ready for the attack.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You gave us T-minute rescued.
I believe they are so.
I can 't smell.
We will have bastards
and set fire ...
them to send to hell.
Quick, fill the buckets with water.
-Well, come on.
The roof is lit.
Quick, get the ladder.
Bring the water here.
-Bucket Brigade.
Jimmy, watch out.
-I need more water.
It also burns al
At attack.
Follow me.
This is the port.
Come on, all at once.
Fred, they beech the port.
They are already inside the fence.
Voorwaarb, voo_aarb.
Colonel, the Indians come
coming. Look.
The red skins are coming.
Run for your life.
You are a wonderful woman.
-And you're 'n old oiler.
My brother.
-The Osage are our friends.
Colonel.
This way. Come on.
But you take this horse.
Ellen.
It is Fred.
Fred is back.
We are 't brave chief
of Osage grateful.
The colonel escaped.
If 't Silver More' tjachtgebied
of the Ute Indians is ...
then the map well.
Here is an Indian symbol:
a bumel which a white rock licks.
That means drawing salt water.
Then that is fixed
the great salt lake.
Look, the sun sets the direction
on. Pal west.
This path runs through the gap Spoken
to the waterfalls ...
and then to 't Silver Lake.
According to the map 't more
surrounded by steep cliffs.
In places that are
roben flat ...
where waterfalls along
flows into the lake.
Exactly.
The waterfall shines as silver.
So it is not
referred to the treasure?
There is only one way to the
Silver Lake: via 's northwest.
Through a crack in the rocks.
We are on the right track.
Above the lake is a cave.
-This is the treasure.
The old chief was right.
That wealth brings only misfortune.
They were just like you Dad
can kill.
I feel doin 'it, Fred.
Your father was
such a simple man.
I previously thought
that it was well rewarded ...
and the evil was punished.
But it was not.
The good guys always suffer.
-Bullshit. That is not true.
Oh, yes, if it is just.
But this time
it will be different.
I grab my dad's killer
though 't my death.
With bare hands, I will ...
-Hold on, Fred.
I know that the
terrible for you to ...
I can not here me resign.
Understand that anyway.
I'm worried about you.
You are so bifter and resentful.
The hate is no plaab
in your heart for ...
There is place for you, Ellen.
Ellen goes with me.
Both Engel and I
wanted to go find the treasure.
And it definitely
also found.
I do not want to be happy
amijken of those plans.
I promised Fred
to avenge his father's death.
So we go with you,
Mr. Patterson.
DenM you that the colonel us
will be chased?
Yes, knows Winnetou 'tjachtgebied
of the Utes. He leads the way.
Sam is also old Hawkens.
-Yes.
He goes everywhere.
A young man is always needed.
I not only remain behind,
because I am willing ...
to the treasure to find.
I just wanted to lose.
Halt. Here we save our camp.
-Dismount.
Colonel, look at the men agree.
I have rarely seen such a mess.
Without the map
we find it never Silver Lake.
Easy. Schuyler is
with 60 men to El Doro.
Hartley already there waiting on us.
But then Patterson
first to the treasure.
That we should avoid.
-We will also do.
Come baby,
I will do you no harm.
Be 's nice, rotinsect.
Wait a minute.
Monster, I get you later.
Do not laugh.
The Papilio polymnestor parinda
is extremely rare.
I like to believe that.
But I would be careful.
There is a lot of scum in the neighborhood.
I got a good horse
and a good rifle.
I'm Karl-Heinz Ulrich Leopold,
the Duke of Glockenspiel.
How do you do?
-Nice to meet you.
Sam Hawkens.
Duke of whiskey and soda.
Old Shatterhand and Winnetou,

and the silver box.
Duke, we your horse
and look at your gun?
Yes, of course.
And? You can also drive?
Unfortunately, the horse
little too big for me.
Would you say
that you really can shoot?
I did not mean just
a shot in the air ...
I meant really ieb boards.
Not-so impatient.
Nice shot.
With a shot was the vulture
Estimated ...
We have to rookie
unjustly been cracks.
I think that is nice.
It is safer when you
is traveling with us.
I thank you very much.
I'm very honored.
Halt.
What is all this smoke?
-Fixed a campfire.
No, that is the smoke of death.
Blijfjij but here, Ellen.
More than ten men
robberies have this village.
That was the colonel
with his gang.
They have the women
and children slain.
I do not see any dead warriors are.
All men are on buffalo hunting.
Come back, Fred.
We have your village
not destroyed. Watch out.
I haven 't strange feeling
that we all know each other.
Not to shoot the men.
Focus on the horses.
We are friends.
Friends of the Indians.
Where's Ellen?
The shots
came from there.
And the tracks run straight.
What is it?
Bring the card to El Doro
or Miss Pafterson vote.
We must go now.
-No, El Doro is a nest robber.
Soon we are in the minority.
-We must liberate her.
There is a chance.
You know the map outing head?
You can 't Silver Lake find themselves?
Yes.
Give mejullie cards. Patterson

Climbing on the rocks.

Everybody in coverage.
Faces appeared, on geefje

Why are you with us?
You have our village

That is not true.
Listen, we have your village

Great Wolf, chief
of the Utes, says that you are lying.

-Pokaimu?
We have you

Who killed Little Dipper then?
-Nobody.
I got him beaten unconscious.
He wanted to kill my friend.
Small Beer is not dead.
He sleeps now.
Why you shelled us?
Your warriors attacked us, but
we are friends of the Utes.
If that is true,
appearing for the tribal council.
As friends?
-If prisoners.
No. Then we prefer
the battle.
Dusjullie choose death?
-Maybe.
But there are also many Utes

Otherwise, my magic stick

Soon he lies in the way

Great Wolf is so brave
like a rabbit.
If your scalp on my belt

I am sick of an old t vrou_je
to follow.
If you're so courageous,
then stand still.
Well?
Who is the winner?
His scalp is now mine.
But I do not want him.
I am a friend of the Indians.
He is not dead.
I pour you his life.

Who will be the bait?
-Winnetou.
Hey, behind me.
This way.
Halt.

Go left.
Where are we, Fred?
On 'n indianenpad

Tomorrow we reach it anymore.
Fred? Is there another way
