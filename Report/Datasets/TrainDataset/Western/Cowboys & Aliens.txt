We're riding towards Absolution.
You know how far west we are?
Maybe he's a dummy.
Is there a reason you're not
answering my question?
Look here Pa.
He's got iron on his wrist.
He's been shot.
Could be he done broke out of hoosegow.
Might be worth bounty-money.
That could be.
It's not your lucky day, stranger.
Turn around and start walking.
I said turn around
and start walking.
Get out.
Hello?
Balls to heaven, friend.
Easy now.
Alright, turn around,
nice and slow.
I've been shot.
Only two kinds of men get shot.
Criminals and victims.
Well, which one are ya?
I don't know.
You got a name, friend?
I don't know that either.
Well, just what do you know?
English.
Well, that... That's a right
odd-looking wound there.
Looks almost cauterised.
Now this might sting a bit.
There you go.
-Is this a mining town?
Yeah. Well, that was the notion.
People moved on though...
...for gold.
Alright now, try and hold still.
There we go.
This is no gunshot.
Where did ya get this, son?
-I don't know.
Well I can't rightly absolve you of your sins,
If you don't recall now, can I?
That being said, I've seen
good men do bad things
bad men do good things.
Whether you're gonna end up
in heaven or hell...
it's not God's plan,
that's your own.
You just gotta remember
What it was.
Alright, put your finger
right here. Come On.
There you go.
There.
-Thank you.
Not bad for a country preacher.
It's that damn fool Dolarhyde kid.
Hey, hey hey hey!
What are you doing?
Percy, there's people out there.
There's no-one out there, it's fine.
It's not fine. It's bad enough
he drinks for free...
..and now he's gonna shoot up the place?
Hey what was that, doc?
Nothing. He didn's say anything.
Everything's okay. -Go back inside.
Shut up.
I wanna hear what you said.
It's bad enough... what?
Are you ungrateful for our business?
Because if it wasn't
for my Pa's cattle,
There'll be no money going
through this town
And there would be no
meat on your tables
And your doors would
be closed. Huh?
I don't mean no disrespect to your
father, Percy. You know that.
Of course not. But you ask me to pay.
Come here, let's settle up.
Come here.
Hey kid, I do not want any trouble.
I'm just trying to...
Better pick up your glasses, doc,
before someone steps on them.
Alright son, we're just trying
to make a living now.
You know what, preacher?
You just gave me an idea.
I know it ain't Sunday, folks, but...
What say we take up a collection
for the poor man, huh?
Now who's got money?
In the hat.
Let's go, much obliged.
I'm sorry, doc's bad fortune has to
be taken out on you good people.
That's mighty Christian of you.
Hey!
You too.
You wanna be careful where you
point that thing before you get hurt.
Listen, eh...
I'm gonna give you the benefit
of the doubt, because...
Maybe you don't know who I am.
Leave me alone.
Hey, you!
I'm warning you.
Where the hell did he come from?
What the hell's going on here?
Well, it was an accident.
He came out of nowhere.
And he dry gulched me.
He tried to make me look like a fool.
It wasn't my fault, Sheriff.
Damn it, Percy. You've crossed
the line this time.
I gotta lock ya up.
Taggart.
You know that's not a good idea.
Well I'm afraid I got no choice, Ned.
Ned? Ned, you son of a bitch,
where are you going?
Don't worry. I'll tell your father
about what happened today.
Don't ruin the coffee there, yankee.
Well, tell you what Ed.
The next time you can have coffee.
-Okay, alright. -Hey why don't you take
it easy on that tileslacking, Murphy.
Mr. Dolarhyde don't like
drinking on the job.
I don't give a rat's ass wat the high and
mighty Colonel Dolarhyde don't like.
I don't care how many Indians he put under neither.
You sure do slap your guns a lot
when the boss ain't around.
I'd say it to his face if he was here!
Colonel Dolarhyde.
Let me tell you something, boys.
Money makes you soft.
Where the hell is that coach?
-Coach? What coach?
-You shot a deputy, Percy.
Federal Marshal's bringing
you to Santa Fe.
Federal Marshal?
Sherriff, have you lost your mind?
My pa is on his way down here.
you better let me out of here,
before things get out of hand.
Sheriff, it was an accident.
it's not like I'm Jesse James..!
Son of a bitch.
Hey, -your whisky
-can you put that on Percy's tab?
Fifty cents.
Just kidding with you there, pal.
Have they no respect in this town?
That's not true, okay?
-You wanna leave?
-No.
This is your dream.
I'd follow you anywhere.
I thought it was our dream.
God dammit!
Charlie, why don't you play
something festive!
It's like a funeral in here.
Hey. You don't have to
prove anything, okay?
Okay? I love you!
I'm not sure how.
Whisky.
On the house, for what you did.
I'm just here to drink.
Do I know you?
-No.
My name is Ella.
Where did you get your bracelet?
Is there something you
know about me maybe?
You do not remember anything, do you?
What do you want?
I know that you're looking for something.
So am I.
Well, good luck to you.
Move away.
Jake Lonergan.
Follow me to the office, so
we can have us a little chat.
I think you've got the wrong man.
Well, I'm gonna need you to
come with us all the same.
Wouldn't do that if I was you.
I don't want any trouble.
Rise and shine.
You're in trouble now..!
You're gonna burn.
here, my pa is coming for me.
He learned how to kill a man
good, and slow. In the war.
I am gonna watch you suffer...
...for a long, long time.
You thought that cheap shot
in the pecker hurt, huh?
Please. I didn't steal your cow.
Colonel Dolarhyde, you've
gotta believe me.
You've only been riding for my
bran for what, two weeks?
You don't maybe know whom
you're dealing with, Roy.
Nobody calls me Colonel.
And them who that did are mostly dead.
Please.
So you had little Mickey's picking
up strays. How many did you get?
About forty-four of 'em, boss.
You've been drinking, ain't
ya? I can smell it on ya.
I haven't been drinking nothing.
You said it yourself, we shouldn't do drinking.
What kind of a man goes 'round
blowing up other peoples cows,
then tells a bullshit story like this?
You could't do no better?
-You gotta believe me, there was a white light.
This bright light.
So there was this big light...
and you fell in the river, and
when you come back...
two of my best hands
has just disappeared.
There weren't no storm...
There weren't no lightning this evening.
You don't respect me, do you Roy?
Where's Percy?
-Taggart locked him up, boss.
-Why?
-What did he do now?
-Shot a deputy.
God dammit.
What the hell does Taggart
think he's doing?
He wouldn't even have a job...
Now I gotta go in there
and reason with him...
...because you failed to
look after my boy.
Thank you. Thank you.
Alright. Everybody saddle up.
Boss, we oughta get more hands.
-Why?
-You're not gonna believe this.
I think Jake Lonergan is in town.
I'm turning you over to the Federal Marshal.
You're gonna tell me
what I'm charged with?
Arson, assault, mayhem...
hijacking...
It says you robbed the stage last month.
With Pat Dolan and Bull McCade.
Which makes you an accesory
to everyone they broke, too.
-Is that it?
-Murder.
Prostitute out in Cottonwood Grove
has con you over.
Name of Alice Wills.
You saying I killed this woman?
You tell me.
Oh damn.
Gimme your wrist.
Taggart, what are you doing?
Sheriff, this is going to far, I....
I was just fooling around.
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
-Go away.
-Listen I'm sorry.
But I had no choice.
I couldn't let you leave.
Well, I'm leaving now.
-I need you.
-If you have got something to say, say it.
I need to know where you came from.
So do I.
Ma'am...
You gov'ners have a nice trip now.
Taggart. Taggart, let me out of here.
Sheriff.
Sheriff..!
What are you doing?
You get back home. Go to bed.
-Please, do not go.
-I have to, Emmett. It's my job.
I don't like it here.
Now your pa is getting things in order
and when he does, he'll send for you.
It's been a year.
Don't worry, he will.
And your mom is buried here.
And you know I can't leave my little girl.
-Taggart.
-Yeah, I see them.
You go inside.
I want my boy, John.
-I knew you'd come for me, Pa.
-Shut up.
i'll deal with you later.
Yes, that's Lonergan, boss.
That's the son of a bitch who
stole my gold, off the coach.
I want that man.
You're gonna have to take it
up with the judge in Santa Fe.
I ain't going to Santa Fe.
You give him to me now.
Or I'm gonna take him.
-What about me, pa?
-I said shut up, boy.
What the hell is that?
What the hell...?
-It's coming back!
-He's coming around.
This one.
-Do not move.
-Wait for me.
-Give me your hand.
-What's going on?
-Give me your hand.
-What the hell for?
I'll get us free.
Give me your hand.
Emmett. Come on son.
Grandpa!
-Gimme your hand.
-No!
Come on, kid. Give me your hand.
What is that?
Get up, boss.
-Come on, we gotta get out of here.
-Where's Percy?
-Come out of there.
-I can't, pa. -Can't?
Coward.
-What is that thing?
-Why are you asking me?
Since you shot us.
-Where did you get this thing?
-I do not know.
What do you mean you do not know?
What the hell is that?
It took my wife.
Hey!
Is anyone in there?
-No. -Is my wife in there?
-No!
Is it dead?
-Is it demons?
-Demons?
Can't rightly say. Sure does
fit the description but uh...
Demons? What are you talking
about? Bible stuff -demons?
-I'm not talking about anything.
-What the hell are you talking about?
-You gotta calm down, Doc.
-Calm down?
You're telling me that a bunch of demons took my wife?
-I didn't say any such thing.
-Took our people...
Boss.
Boss, it went this way.
I do not know what it is, but it's bleeding.
It's in the same direction those
machines went with our kin.
We're not gonna be able
to track it in the dark.
Round up the horses,  get some supplies.
We set off first light.
You...
...You're going with us.
I need that weapon, it's
the only thing that counts.
I figure you owe me.
I don't see it that way.
What do you want?
What do you want?
Just tell me right now, or I'll kill you.
They took my people, too.
I've been looking for them a long time.
I know you can help me find them.
You stay away from me.
I can help you.
It's heading north.
It's tracks are still fresh.
-If it's all the same, I'd ride along too.
-Yes, ma'am.
We got a kid and a dog,
why not a woman.
You're back.
What is that?
-you have to take it back.
-Like hell I will.
-That's blood money.
-Well I didn't goddamn harm anyone.
-By robbing and killing.
That's gonna get us what we need.
-Jake. -Stay there.
-Jake.
Well, well, well.
Look who's back.
I'm seeing you, but I don't see my gold.
Well let's say we find
those people first huh?
And then you can take your
best shot at collecting.
Maybe that reward on your head would
be a more attractive proposition.
Or I could just shoot you in the chest
and cut that thing off your arm.
You know Doc, I don't even
know why we're doing this.
You know, they're all dead.
Well, if think if they wanted to
kill 'em I think they would have.
Well if.. if the boss is right,
they was roping 'em...
...then it's to eat 'em.
If it's me, I'd start with your wife.
Are you gonna be like this the whole trip?
Cause if you are,  I pay it youre not gonna have too
many long conversations, are we?
Why don앖 you just sing a song or something.
Cook some beans. Do something useful.
Take some friendly advice?
You get yourself a gun,
and learn how to use it.
Tracks are washed away.
I dont know much about boats...
...but I'd say that one is upside-down.
Five hundred miles from any river,
big enough to hold it.
Well let's get inside,
get out of the rain.
I'm not going anywhere near that thing.
Suit yourself.
Sleep in the rain.
You're fixin' to say something?
Maybe ... maybe we should
have called in the army?
I ain't going to turn this
over to no WestPointers
gotta get on the telegraph, ask
Washington which hand to wipe with.
we waited around to ...
for them to tell me what to do.
I lost 328 men.
over a cornfield.
I remember the stories.
I don't recollect telling
you any stories.
I'd listened when you tell them to Percy.
Yoy get this through
your thick Indian skull...
The stories weren't for you.
They were for my son.
Now get out of here.
Go look after the horses.
Do your job.
You've been looking at this knife.
Do you like this knife?
You look after that.
Don't lose it.
Don't yank on that,
it's not your pecker.
Now here. Look -you're holding on to
this thing like you're hanging from it.
What the hell am I doing?
It's my fault she got took, I never
should have taken her to that town.
Oh, no no no. It's not your fault.
You'll get her back. You're setting things
right. You just gotta have faith, that's all.
-Faith?
-Hm, hm.
Yeah. Captain, real swell to me.
I don't mean no disrespect
preacher, but He ain't up there...
or He don't like me very much.
Well surely you don't expect the Lord
to do everything for you, do you Doc?
You gotta earn His presence.
And then you gotta recognise it...
and then you gotta act on it.
Now keep your eye on the target.
And shoot.
That's better, better. Come on.
Let's reload.
You've been there long?
Yes.
Is there something you need?
Who is she?
-She's the only one who knows who I am.
-You know who you are.
-You just have to remember.
-Well I can't.
Yes you can.
Does it hurt?
It's fine.
It's here.
Easy easy, Rafani. Easy.
What's wrong boy?
Hello?
Get away from that boy!
No!
The boy.. the boy!
-He's fine.
It's okay, it's okay.
You go get our people back.
Don't let anybody tell you worse, son.
Only you know who you are.
Dog.
Come on, boy.
Where are you?
Tracks are good, it's headed north.
-Where's the men?
-They've run off. God damn cowards.
I can't find the dog.
We ain't waiting for 'm, he has
run of or dead. Let's go.
Hey, hey wait. Aren't we
gonna say some words?
The only one who knows
what to say, is under ground.
Ain't it enough, we took the
time to put him there?
No. no, it's not enough.
You go ahead.
Ah, Lord, er..
If there is such thing as a soul...
This man had a good one,
Please protect it.
Made me feel better. The world
was a better place for having him.
Dust to dust, amen. How's that?
Good words.
What are you all choked-up about?
I'm worried about my grandpa.
Look, when I was only just a little
bit older than you are now...
All of this was Mexico.
the word had come that the Apaches
was riding towards the settlement
Called... Jerauaca.
My father wanted me to be a man...
so he made me ride out with the garison,
bangin' on the drum.
Boy was I scared.
Well, we got there, it was too late.
and they were all dead.
The place was all burnt down.
This one settler fell out.
He came crawling out of a burning cabin.
He was burned.
He knew he was gonna die.
He was burned bad.
He rolled over...
looked up into my eyes...
He said: kill me.
What did you do?
I took this knife off his belt...
and I slit his throat.
Take it.
Be a man.
That's a little rough isn't it?
-He means well.
I got him.
The tracks are closer together.
He's slowing down and headed for that canyon.
Put your hands up in the air!
That means you too, pretty lady.
This is what they call a hold-up.
Welcome everybody.
Welcome.
Boss?
Boss, is that you?
Lonergan, what the hell are you doing here?
Patron.
Who are your uh, amigos?
This is your new 'gang' gang?
I never thought I'd see you again, Jake.
You were always my favorite.
Shut up.
Jake, did you break my tooth?
Would you shut up? I'm thinking.
How many boys have we got left?
About the same.
-Which is...
-Thirty?
That's right. Thirty. Good.
That's good.
You're gonna bring me to the camp.
You just gotta know how
to set things straight.
Ah, we're gonna go to the camp!
How's the haul?
-Gopher-mine gold.
They're looking pretty rich.
-How much dynamite have we got?
-About fifty sticks or so.
Dolan.
'Bout time you got back.
-What the hell happened to you?
-He er...
Well, shit.
You've got some balls.
Riding back in here like nothing ever happened.
Boys. Grab your guns.
We're riding out.
Boys aren't going anywhere with you, Jake.
We've fixed 'em to rob us a coach.
and that's exactly what we're gonna do.
Are you her?
Am I who?
The whore, that Jake quit this gang for.
-You watch your mouth.
-Or what?
I run this outfit now.
Put your guns on the whore.
If he so much as twitches, blow
her brains out of her ear.
He said the whore.
You call her a whore again, it'll be
the last word you'll ever say.
You are in no position to make threats.
Hunte, take his gun.
Take his gun.
I'm sorry, Jake.
Where is our gold, Jake?
I don't remember.
Well, I do remember.
You're telling us you is leaving us
high and dry because of some woman.
I guess you just left out the part about taking
all of our gold from that last job, huh?
So I'm gonna ask you one last time.
Where is it, Jake?
Demons.
-What's that?
-Demons took your gold.
When you get to hell...
you can ask for it back.
Kill the whore.
I told you not to call her that.
Everybody. Drop 'em!
I said, drop 'em!
How fun is it?
You know... that wasn't very nice..!
-On your horses.
-Go.
Jake Jake, don't forget your gun.
You'll always be my favorite.
Get 'em! Ride!
-They're here.
-Move out.
Come on!
Okay I got ya. I got ya!
Can you swim?
-Oh God.
-Turn your head.
Are you alright?
Let's get in.
-We were flying.
-Yeah.
-I don't want to do that again.
-No.
Hey.
Hey, you stay with me.
Keep talking.
You remember now, don't you?
-What?
-The woman.
Did you love her?
-You can tell me.
-I can't remember.
I mus have...
All I know is that I owe it to her.
I still have to find her.
Sorry. I'm Sorry.
I got ya. I got you.
It's not far now.
You and me...
...We're gonna be just fine.
Is that.. is that them?
Boss!
-I got it. -Give her to me Ned.
Bring her here.
-Here.
-No... give it to her.
Doc?
How is she?
-She's gone.
-No.
She's not gone. She's ...
NOT GONE!
Jake.
She's gone.
-Doc.
-That's it.
Doc!
This is Black Knife.
There's no reasoning with them.
We're all gonna die anyway.
-This is what's left of the Chiricajas.
He saying the white people, they
brought all this evil to his people.
WE brought evil?
Evil was HERE!
You're the evil one.
He saying we've brought the monsters.
We didn't bring the monsters.
Tell him they took our people too.
-Tell him that they took my wife.
-There is no reasoning with 'em.
Sorry, but I could't tell you.
-Are you one of them?
-No.
I'm from a different place.
I took this form, so I could walk among you.
Well, you should have told me.
I didn't know if I could
heal this body.
If I would wake up.
He wants to know where you're from.
-What did she say? -She came from
a place above the stars.
What do you mean, another world?
What does that mean?
-What?
-He says you shouldn't talk.
What do you mean I shouldn't
talk, I got questions.
-You're a guest of the chief.
-Oh now I'm a guest?
I thought I was a prisoner.
You're both big men, great warriors.
Can we just listen to the woman tell her story?
Or whatever she is?
What are they doing here?
They want gold.
Well that's just ridiculous. What are
they gonna do, buy something?
It is as rare to them, as it is to you.
-What about my grandpa?
-What about my wife,
what about the other people,
are they still alive?
If they are, they won't be for long.
They're studying your weaknesses.
These are just scouts.
If we let them leave,
they'll come back with more
and there will be no survivors.
It's what they did to my people.
I came here to make sure it
would not happen again.
But we have to work together.
He says his people will join her.
What do you mean, join her? What's she
gonna do? Where are you gonna go?
We can find them. He knows where they are.
No I don't .
I can't remember anything.
I can't even remember my own name.
He says they will take care of that.
I brought the gold to the house.
It's where she died.
It's not your fault.
I know where they are.
Jesus, Mary and Josef.
-How did they build something like that?
-They arrived in it.
It's their vessel.
That's only the top, the rest is under
ground. It's how they mine for gold.
So there is gold here.
Can they see out of here?
They don't see well in daylight.
They stay under ground,
in caverns where it's dark.
We never even gonna get close.
These flying machines will pick us
off before we even get near it.
There is another way in.
Down there. The way I came out.
We gotta get those creatures
out of there, out in the open.
where we can get at them.
So you can get in there with that
arm gun, get our people out.
We have one advantage.
They underestimate you.
You are like insects to them.
The're not planning on defending
themselves, so they'll be vulnerable.
-We do not have enough men.
-Obviously they ain't gonna walk.
He says he wants to use
your spyglass.
The Apaches are mountain warriors.
He says it is better to fight from high ground.
Tell him he's a fool.
There's no high ground while
they've got those flying machines.
Jake's leaving.
Well that's just dandy.
Son of a bitch.
-Quit stalling, how much gold we have left?
-Barely enough.
But I'm gonna take my share right now, so I can
get as far away from here as I possibly can.
-Red.
-I have got him, Bull.
Well I had one hell of a job finding you boys.
Are you planning a trip?
We're going as far away as we can go.
-Remember la playa in Porto Vallarta?
- Yeah, you got good fishing.
Good tequila, you wanna come with us?
It will make no difference.
It's not far enough.
Well they ain't worse things, Jake.
Doesn't matter. They're gonna find us.
And they're gonna wipe us out.
What in the hell are you saying?
What I am saying is, you have got a choice.
You can drink your last few
hours away on a beach...
...which, by the way, is not a bad idea...
...or you can follow me one last time.
We've gotta make the best use of our resources.
We've gotta need a strategy.
Listen to me dammit!
He doesn't understand jack.
You've got to explain to him.
Look, we can't just run around hollering
and throwing spears and shooting
arrows at the damn thing.
We gotta draw them outta there,
onto open ground.
Where we can surround them,
attack them on all sides.
Flank 'em.
Explain to him.
He said he's not gonna let you lead his people.
What's he saying?
He saying they need to open their hearts
and see in you what he has seen.
When his parents died in the Mexican war...
...when you took him in when he was only a boy.
That you gave him purpose.
of how to take care of himself.
Even though youre not blood.
That you despise battle.
and you're a fierce warrior, worthy of any fight.
He says if you're such a great warrior, why do you
only have a man and a boy to follow you into battle.
Dog.
Dog!
Hot damn.
Are you ready to get
your son back?
Matches.
I don't know how we're going about this,
we're gonna have to go down...
...I don't know what we're gonna do.
Go.
Go. Go!
I think we've destroyed it.
Demons are coming around us.
Take this and go up where I showed you.
When you see our people, wave your arms.
-Yes, sir.
Move out.
Good job.
Good people you have in there.
I'll get them out.
God speed.
Let's go!
This is how they get the gold out.
They are not going down!
-They will.
Keep at it.
Then we get our people out.
Doc.
Doc, get down here.
Jesus.
Doc!
Did we get one?
Yeah, we got one.
I've always dreamed of
riding into battle with you.
I always dreamed of
having a son like you.
Go. Get Percy.
Get your son.
Don't look into the light.
I told you not to look into the light.
-You're right.
How long are they gonna be like this?
-Each one is different.
Hold them off.
-You better hurry.
There압 more of them coming.
Go.
Everybody is out.
Right.
Hey, where are you going?
It is this way.
Dog, come on.
What the hell are you doing?
We have to get out of here.
No
I came here to destroy that thing.
-How?
-The bracelet. Take it off.
-I can앖 take it off.
-Yes you can, you can control it.
-How?
The same way you shoot it, with your mind.
You have to stop thinking.
This isn앖 gonna work.
It fell off.
If I can get it to it압 core, I can stop them.
Let압 go.
Take this.
Throw it!
Goodbye, Jake.
-What?
What? No!
I see them. They got out.
Theyre coming out through the side.
Do you see Percy?
-Yeah, I see him.
-What about Jake and Ella?
No, theyre not there.
Are you alright old man?
-Where's the girl?
-She압 still inside.
Grandpa.
It's me.
Emmett.
-Emmett.
Youre all grown up.
Percy.
Don앖 you remember me, boy?
I앐 sorry, I don앖 remember much.
I'm your father.
Oh Pa.
Do you remember me?
I thought you were dead.
If there was gold, we could
have made things different.
Were gonna have a railroad in here soon.
That앏l change the cattle business.
Run these ledgers back to the bank for me, will you?
The foreman needs some new checks.
Okay.
I want the new ones to read "Dolarhyde and Son".
Sound good to you?
-Yes.
Eh, yes, sir.
John.
-Woodrow.
Guess our town is about to get a whole lot bigger.
You weren앖 gonna leave without
saying goodbye, were you?
I am a wanted man.
I could have sworn I saw Jake Lonergan
die in those caves, didn앖 you, Sheriff?
Damn shame. And I was looking
forward to hanging him myself.
-I could use a good man around here.
-Yes you could.
Jake.
She압 in a better place.
I앏l see you around, Colonel.
The End.
