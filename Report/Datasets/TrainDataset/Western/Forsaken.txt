Your mother is dead.
I did not know
that she had passed.
How could you?
If I had known that she
had been sick, I'd have...
You would've done what?
You would've come home
if you knew she was dying?
But you couldn't come home
when she was living,
when she was full of hope?
How did she pass?
In my arms,
lying beside me in bed.
Weeping-
Calling out your name.
Is it your plan to stay a while?
Not sure yet.
You don't wear guns.
I put them away.
I'm done with that.
Hm!
What is that supposed to mean?
It means I don't know if a man
can get away from who he is.
And you think you know who I am?
I thought I did.
I'll be back.
I have to go into town.
I'll go with ya.
Oh, morning, Reverend.
And I'll be right with, uh,
you, sir, just as soon as I...
Lord sakes! John Henry,
is that you?
Hello, Mr. Parsons.
Lord almighty, John Henry.
I ain't seen you since
you went off to war.
I asked the saloon to order
some sipping cider
from Cheyenne for me.
Would you see if
it's arrived please?
Mr. Parsons.
Must do your heart good
to see the boy again.
I have a list.
Reverend Clayton sent me
to pick up his cider.
And who are you?
His son, John Henry.
Well, well, well.
If it ain't John Henry Clayton.
I heard a lot about you.
Name's Frank Tillman.
Maybe you heard of me?
Can't say as I have.
Well, uh, I killed four men.
Still don't ring a bell.
How come you ain't
wearing a gun?
You go and, uh, get
religion or something?
Stop pestering our guests.
Git.
My name is Dave Turner.
Some call me Gentleman Dave.
Yeah, I heard of you.
You're gonna have to
forgive my compatriots.
Boredom often gets
the best of 'em.
I had the good fortune of
watching you rid this world
Of Big Jim Westfield
down in Coldwell County
a few years back.
Most impressive.
May I ask what brings you
to Fowler?
I'm only trying to ascertain
the nature of our relationship.
I'm hoping there
won't be any trouble.
Not from me.
I don't recall things
being so prosperous.
Prosperous to some.
Railroads coming.
Buggy's not gonna load itself.
Take these.
Take this. Don't you
spend it all at once.
Mr. McCurdy,
guess who was just in here
not five minutes ago?
John Henry Clayton.
Is he gonna be a problem?
He didn't look too tough to me.
I'm not asking you.
Is he gonna be a problem?
He was not wearing a sidearm.
That doesn't mean
he can't put one on.
If he takes his pa's side
in this,
it could be a problem.
Well,
why don't you just
leave all that to me?
What are they doing here?
You don't know?
How would I?
I thought maybe your coming here
might have something
to do with them.
Well, it don't.
They work for McCurdy.
He got his mind set on
buying every farm around here.
Folks who don't wanna sell,
they got some persuading
from those fellas over there.
If you don't know 'em,
you better stay away from them.
Those are damned men.
Those are godless men.
Is it your plan to come
to church tomorrow?
Is that an invitation, Pa?
Come back here!
What is the reason
you came home?
I didn't know I had
to have a reason, Pa.
If you want me to go, I'll go.
I'm a forthright man.
You're an embarrassment to me.
Today in there,
all I felt was shame.
But if you come back
committed to God
to truly change your ways,
then it's God's edict that
I forgive you and I do.
But in your mother's name
I cannot forget
the past 10 years.
I cannot
I know.
What in the world are you doing?
Ma always wanted us to
clear this field together.
You and me?
No, she didn't.
As far as I recall it's the only
thing she ever asked of us.
Not me.
Fine. I'll do it alone.
All right.
REVEREND CLAYTON:
have lost heart
that I would see the goodness
of the Lord's light.
Excuse me.
Gentleman.
We think we should bring in
our own hired guns.
That's right. Yep.
Hired gun. To do what?
Start a war? Kill everyone?
Guns are not the answer.
Ever since Sheriff Hutton ran
off in the middle of night,
McCurdy and his boys
been getting bolder.
HARPER: Forced Tim Fuller off
his land last week.
Now they're
threatening Peterson.
They come on my land,
they'll be looking to the
wrong end of my 10 gauge.
Wait, Daniel. Wait. I've wired
the U.S. Marshall.
We will have the law
on our side.
We're poor.
When has the law ever
cared about folks like us?
No one's comin'.
Reverend.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Mary Alice.
Heard people say in church
you were back.
Didn't believe it.
Needed to come out
and see for myself.
I've been back a few days or so.
A few days and you haven't
come and seen me?
I planned on it, I just...
You always were a terrible liar.
I waited for this day.
Thought about it.
Planned what I might say.
Now I don't know what to say.
You clearing all
this by yourself?
Yes, ma'am.
Lot of work for one man.
Shovel right over there
if you care to help.
You look well.
I swear you look the same
as the day I left.
Now there you go lying again.
I don't recall you being
so distrustful of folks,
Mary Alice.
I'd never lie to you.
Well, I seem to recall you
saying something about
coming back after the war.
Well, I better let you
get back to your work.
Maybe after I get settled
we could ride out to the bluffs
like we used to.
That wouldn't be right.
I'm married.
Married?
Going on eight years now.
I have a little boy, Charlie.
I thought you knew.
No. No, I did not know that.
I waited for you.
But when the years passed
and there was no word and...
Mary Alice, you do not
owe me an explanation.
Who did you marry?
Tom Watson.
Tom's a good man.
Yes, he is.
Welcome home, John Henry.
Shit!
All right.
Bring 'em in, come on.
What the... Dan!
We was just coming
to pay you a visit.
Appreciate you saving us a ride.
I've got nothing to say to you.
Oh well,
I got something to say to you.
That's enough.
You don't wanna
kill him now, do ya?
Well maybe I do. I...
I hadn't decided yet.
I'm taking him home.
Uh, hold on there now.
It ain't you who's
doing the deciding.
May I take him home?
And what if I say no?
What you gonna do about it?
Nothing.
I'm sorry. I didn't
quite hear that.
Nothing.
All right, John Henry.
You have my permission
to take him home.
Somethings troubling you?
Your mother and I kept
asking ourselves,
asking God,
what we done wrong
in your upbringing?
What did we do that filled you
with so much hate?
It weren't you.
John 8:32, remember?
The truth will set you free.
God knows the truth.
All through the war I kept
asking myself, where was God?
Where was he at Shiloh
and Seven Pines
when men lay dead and dying?
All good men,
God-fearing men.
They just lay there, begging
for some small act of mercy
on His behalf.
And then it finally
dawned on me:
There ain't no God.
There is no God?
All I'm saying is that
if there was ever a time
that man needed God it was then
and trust me, he wasn't there.
If you're expecting God to
save you, he ain't gonna.
Most men came out of that
war wanting nothing more
to do with killing, but not you.
You went looking for it.
God is not responsible
for the life you choose.
I did not choose it!
Get off my land.
We just come to finish
the conversation
that was interrupted, Dan.
DAVE:
Let us avoid unpleasantness.
Sir, I implore you
to see reason.
If you take a fair grasp of your
situation, you will arrive
at the only reasonable
conclusion available to you.
I'm stayin'.
Dirt and rock.
Exactly like the dirt and the
rocks you would find anywhere.
Yeah, but it's my dirt
and my rock!
Yes, and a fine rock it is too.
Is worth dying over?
You believe your wife
would prefer the dirt
and the rock to you?
Will this keep her warm at night
or put the food on the table?
Is it gonna teach your
children right from wrong?
Comfort them in their beds
when they're frightened
by the wind?
You see, I do understand.
I do understand. I truly do
understand the inequities
of your position, sir,
but I believe when you weigh
the alternatives,
you will see that...
There was no need for that.
We were talking.
It would appear the
conversation's over now, Dave.
He was about to see reason.
CLYDE: You actually ever
kill anybody, Dave,
or you just talk 'em to death?
Anybody else have
something to say?
REVEREND CLAYTON:
Daniel Peterson...
is now safely
in the embrace of our Lord.
But for us, here on earth,
a good man has been taken.
A provider for his family,
a friend to our community,
and in our despair,
we rail against God.
Our faith is tested,
pushed to its very limits.
But Almighty God has a purpose.
And senseless
though it may seem to us,
it is not for mere mortal man
to question God's wisdom.
It is for us to persevere
in a righteous way.
- We gotta do something.
Like what?
- I don't know.
We can't sit around doing nothing.
What about getting a sheriff?
We tried. Most men ain't got the
stomach for a fight like this.
We need a man who knows trouble,
a man who others fear.
You suppose he might
come to our aid?
Put that out of
your head right now.
We could pay him. Took
a collection. We got $200.
He's done with that life.
I can't believe James
would let it come to this.
They killed Daniel Peterson.
I never thought
they'd kill one of us.
It's only gonna get worse.
What makes you say that?
'Cause after the first one,
it gets easier.
You want something?
They heat up a good steak.
No, thank you.
Mrs. Peterson came in
and sold me her farm
on the way out of town.
Two other families
wanna sell also.
What I'm saying is, it looks
like a more aggressive approach
is having an effect
on the locals.
Clyde murdered that man.
From what I heard, Peterson
was holding a shotgun.
I did not come hereto be
part of a pack of murderers.
What the fuck did ya think was
gonna happen Dave, huh? What?
You think I brought you hereto
sweet-talk folk off their land?
Oh come on, Dave, please.
I want Frank
to take care of things
when it comes to the farms.
He seems to have the
temperament required.
And me?
Oh, I still want you here.
I believe it's only
a matter of time
before John Henry Clayton
picks up his guns.
Hear we're riding to the
Chadwick farm tomorrow.
Why don't you just
stand up on the bar
and announce our intention
to all creation?
Sorry, guess my enthusiasm
got the better of me.
You planning to eat today?
Ain't hungry.
Need to eat.
Told you, I ain't hungry.
You're trying to prove
something out here.
I ain't trying to prove nothing.
Yes, you are.
You're working this
land day in, day out.
You're so weary, time night
comes, you can barely move.
It's not for love of farming.
I know why it is.
You're trying to use
this poor earth
to sweat out all
your guilt and anger.
That's what it is, isn't it?
No.
Just because you don't believe
me, Pa, don't make it so.
I told you I'm doing this
because Ma wanted it.
What your mother wanted was for
you to come back from the war.
What about you, Pa?
Did you want me to come back?
Simple enough question.
Did it even bother you that I
didn't come back after the war?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the day
you turned your back on me,
the day my brother,
William, died.
That's not true.
Ma saw it.
Why the hell do you think she
wanted us to
clear this field together?
She tried to help us
put things right.
There was nothing to put right.
I remember it as if
it was yesterday.
Mr. Jenkins came across
William and I down river.
Somehow he managed to drag
us out of there,
get us up to his cabin.
He told his boy to go fetch you.
I was so cold and scared
I couldn't stop shaking.
When you arrived, I could hear
Mr. Jenkins trying to explain
to you that one of your sons
had passed.
Before you could get the
name out you rushed in
and you saw me.
And I'll never forget it.
The look of disappointment
on your face.
How could you think
such a thing?
Am I wrong?
I didn't feel any
disappointment, far from it.
But I would be a liar
if I said to you
I haven't felt it since.
When word came back
about your exploits,
I couldn't help but think
William might've made
more of his life.
Yeah.
Chadwick!
SLADE:
It's an ambush!
How the hell they know
we was coming?
Maybe they heard ya.
That don't explain why there's
so many guns waiting for us.
Just heard Chadwick
rode through the night
and came back with his kin
from Landers.
What would prompt him
to do such a thing?
That one flapped his gum
so loud the other day
someone must've heard and
warned 'em we was coming.
Dan Thompson was a good man;
Died 'cause of that one's
foolishness.
Ah, let him bleed out.
How's the field coming?
Almost all the trees are down.
Should start working
the land pretty soon.
So I take it with all the
effort you're putting in
that you're planning on staying.
Not sure yet.
Why's that?
Don't exactly know
where I fit in.
This is your home.
If a man can't fit in here,
where can he?
You ever thought about
what it might've been
if you'd come back
after the war?
So you never thought about it?
I ain't the same as the man
that left all them years back.
I need to understand
why you didn't come back.
I think I'm entitled
to that much.
I'll say this,
and I will say no more
on the subject.
The thought of
coming back to you
was the only thing that got me
through that damn war.
And when it was over,
I swear to you on my life,
I tried coming home.
I swore I was done with killing.
She just wasn't done with me.
You remember the day you left?
I gave you a red ribbon
from my hair.
Told you to hold onto it till
you could bring it back to me.
Yes, I remember.
You still have it?
Does it matter?
I'd like to know.
You were right to
marry Tom, Mary Alice.
You were right.
You wanted to see me?
I set you a simple task.
You wanna explain to me
how you took that task
and fucked it up
in every conceivable way?
Mmm...
well I think
everything's all right.
Everything's all right.
You got two men dead...
One by your own hand...
Chadwick's still on his land,
and I may not be as clever as
you, but to my way of thinking
no way that adds up
to all right.
If these things aren't
dealt with quickly,
it could give the others ideas.
The last thing we need
is these muddle heads
thinking they can
stand up to us.
Regret marrying me?
What kind of question is that?
I seen John Henry here
earlier today.
$0?
So, I know how you
felt about him.
That was a long time ago.
You're my husband, Tom.
I have no regrets.
I'm sorry for your loss.
No, you ain't.
Eventually...
someone's gonna have the nerve
to stand up to you.
And when that day comes,
I want to be here
to spit on your grave.
Well, ma'am, feel free to do so.
Provided you can find your way
to the front of the line.
Uh, 20 pounds of seed, salt.
I'll settle the account.
All right, Reverend.
In a bit of a hurry. You don't
mind if I cut in here, do ya?
Uh, gimme a box of .44 skins
and a bottle of
that tonic water.
I got me a headache.
Ahh.
You done?
I look like I'm done?
Look what you made me do.
Oh I'll just, uh, clean that up.
No, no, it's all right.
John Henry'll get it.
Won't you, John Henry?
Yeah, get it all.
Don't miss that spot over there.
Oh, and you got some on my boot.
You know, I don't care for
the way you're looking at me.
You know what your
problem is, John Henry?
You wanna act like a pilgrim,
but you still got the attitude
of a killer.
I'll come back later,
Mr. Parsons.
Where do ya think you're going?
Get out of my way.
Oh, ya see? There ya go,
being rude again.
No!
Not so smart, are you now,
gunslinger?
No!
Somebody help us.
Hey, hey, come on now.
We're just funnin'.
Come on, Ned, hit him again.
Come on, John Henry, get up.
John Henry, stay down.
REVEREND CLAYTON:
Somebody help! Please!
It's John Henry.
Where you going?
He needs help.
Well, others will help him.
He's my friend.
I said get back here, woman!
McCURDY:
Welcome, gentleman.
Why don't you get
the gentlemen some drinks?
You must be really thirsty
to be drinking in my place.
Let me be.
I heard about what
happened on the street.
Seems women get bolder
every year, don't they?
I believe I have a proposal
which might be of benefit
to both of us.
Now the last thing I want
is to interfere
in a man's marital affairs,
but it appears that
a change in locale for you
might be a solution
for both of us.
When you got a fox
in the henhouse,
only two things to do:
Kill the fox or
move the henhouse.
Sell the land, take
the money, move away.
Far, far from here
and John Henry Clayton.
Done.
Oh my.
How are you feeling?
I wish people would
stop asking me that.
It's only natural
for friends to inquire.
Is that what we are, Dave?
Friends?
I'd like to think so.
Then answer me this:
Do you think there's a place
for men like us to go,
get away from the killing?
My experience would
lead me to say no.
After the war I swore to myself
I'd never pick up a gun again.
You can't go through
something like that
and expect to be who you were.
I suppose.
May I ask, what was
the worst of it for ya?
Without a doubt, Shiloh.
I would concur.
That first day at Owl Creek
I lost a lot of good friends.
I was there at Owl Creek.
I do not recall
seeing you there.
I was on the other
side of the creek.
Well.
It would appear the past
is close to repeating
itself with us.
I feel you and I are headed
for an inevitable conclusion.
I got no fight with you, Dave.
Besides, if I was looking for
trouble, you'd already know it.
How so?
'Cause I'd have gone into town
and I'd have killed Frank
and that big fella.
I do admire your restraint,
John Henry. I do.
God knows I could not turn
the other cheek
the way that you have.
But I also know if you
kick a dog long enough,
he's gonna bite.
So whatever it is that's
given you the strength
to stay out of this,
I pray you hold on to it.
I don't wanna see you on
the other side of that creek.
REVEREND CLAYTON:
The Lord is my light
and my salvation.
Whom should I fear?
The Lord is the
strength of my life.
Of whom shall I be afraid?
Teach me thy way, Oh Lord.
Lead me in a smooth path
because of my enemies.
Do not deliver me to the will
of my adversaries.
And such as breathe
out violence.
I would have lost heart
if I had not believed
that I would see the goodness
of the Lord
in the land of the living.
Wait for the Lord.
Be of good courage and
he shall strengthen your heart.
Wait, I say, on the Lord.
Amen.
Hey there.
It's good to see you
finding your way back.
Thank you.
We're leaving now!
You stay away from her.
What are you saying, Tom?
You don't think I see
what's going on?
What's going on?
Tom.
Stay out of this, Reverend.
Look at all of us, huh?
He comes back here
after all these years
and we welcome him home
with smiles and open arms.
Why? Huh?
I'll tell you why.
'Cause we're all afraid of him
and the things he's done
and things he might do.
You think you can walk back
in here after all these years
and just pick up
where you left off?
I understand what
you're thinking Tom,
but you're wrong.
Then tell me you don't love her.
I want you to tell me in
front of God, your father,
and everyone here
that you don't love her.
Say it!
Tell me you don't love her!
You're wrong about him, Tom.
Mr. McCurdy, I need
to talk to you.
The papers will be ready
for you to sign Tuesday.
No, I've decided
not to sell to you.
Something funny?
I'm amused at how many times
my ears play tricks on me.
For a moment I thought
I heard you say you wish
to extricate yourself from
the agreement we made.
Of course, I know you
couldn't've said that.
I did say that.
See, I been thinking my...
Shut up!
Before you open your yap again,
I want you to consider
the full ramifications
of your fucking actions.
We had a deal.
I didn't sign nothing.
Words were spoke.
Hands were shook.
Well, I've had a
change of heart.
Come to realize that a new
start don't mean much
if you carrying old
feelings with you.
Oh well, that's very
fucking deep, Tom.
Almost poetic.
And as I wipe a weepy tear
from my eye let me say this:
I'm not one who holds high
principles, but when a man
shakes my hand and says
he's gonna do something,
I expect him to follow through.
Now you be here before
the end of business Tuesday
and sign those papers.
And bid this town
a fond farewell
or suffer the fucking
consequences.
Well, I ain't gonna just
sit here pretending
that you and I have ever
seen eye to eye on, well...
pretty much anything.
Reason I ain't coming here
begging for forgiveness
is because I don't think
I deserve it.
But I would be mighty grateful
if you could make my purpose
a little more clear to me.
Before I came home,
I was just drifting.
Town to town.
Ended up in a small
place called Norton,
way over in Kansas.
Been riding hard, went in
the saloon for a drink.
Two men come up on me
looking for a fight,
so I gave it to 'em.
Cut one of 'em up pretty bad,
outdrew on the other.
Told him to pick up
his partner and get.
All I had to do
was leave that town.
But I didn't.
I waited.
Daring 'em to come after me.
And sure enough,
when I walked outside
those two young men
started firing on me.
Shot out my horse. I drew
my pistol. I fired back.
I killed them.
I killed them both.
In the middle of all of it
one of my shots went wide,
straight through
a storefront window.
Woman came out screaming,
covered in blood.
First I thought I'd shot her.
Then her husband come out...
carrying a little boy.
I killed a boy, Pop.
He looked to be
the same age as William.
He just lay there dead
'cause of what I'd done.
Just like William did.
William didn't die
because of you.
You're not responsible
for your brother's death.
You told me not to take him
down to the river.
I told both of you. You were
boys doing what boys do.
It was an accident.
Tragic, but an accident.
I often think about
what my brother
would've grown up to be.
Now I can't stop thinking
about what that little boy
from Norton would've
grown up to be.
The only thing I know
that's true in my heart
is that both of those boys
would've grown up to be
a far cry better than me.
Pa, I'm so sorry
for what I've become.
Charlie, Charlie.
Go on, stay inside.
Might I have a word
with you, ma'am?
We have no business that
I know of, Mr. McCurdy.
That you know of.
Your husband and I have spoken
about him selling his farm.
Well, I'd be surprised
if my husband entertained
such an idea.
Well, ma'am, if that
surprises you,
you'll be dumbstruck to learn
he's agreed to the sale
of the property.
I don't believe you.
Well, that's of little
concern to me,
being as he's the title holder.
I want you off my land.
And you have every right
to do so for another...
And if we're still here?
Then I'd start looking
for a black dress.
Let's go.
Whoa.
McCurdy wants our land.
You should be speaking
with your husband.
I'm speaking to you.
Tom made a deal with McCurdy
and now he's changed his mind.
Mary Alice, you need to go home
and speak with your husband.
He's gonna get himself killed.
I don't want that for my boy.
You know why he's doing this.
To prove that he's
as good as you are.
Mary Alice,
I've seen this before
and it only ends one way.
You wanna save your family?
You take what McCurdy's
offering and you move away.
You understand me?
You move away.
Excuse me, Mr. McCurdy?
Reverend's here.
He wants a word with you.
Did he say what it's about?
Tom Watson.
Oh, I should've known.
Show him in.
You're to leave the
Watsons alone, James.
You sure do have a
repetitive nature, Samuel.
I mean it.
Mean what? What are you
gonna do if I don't, hm?
Command the Lord to strike me
dead with a lightning bolt?
We were friends.
I'm asking you,
stop doing what you're doing
to Tom Watson.
Tom Watson shook my hand
and agreed to a deal.
He's not going to leave.
He Will.
One way or another, he will.
McCURDY:
You did what?
No!
What are you...
what are you
shaking your head at?
A damn fool, Frank.
You did the one thing
that will bring John Henry
Clayton into this.
Pa!
In the back!
How is he?
I don't know yet.
Pa.
DOC MILLER:
John Henry.
How is he?
Well, the blade missed
any vital organs,
but he did lose a fair
amount of blood.
We'll know more in the morning.
I wanna see him.
He's not conscious.
I just wanna sit with him.
Don't you even think
of leaving me, old man.
Not now.
Not after everything
we've come through.
I'll get the doc.
No. Listen to me, son.
I have to tell you something.
I was wrong.
I was wrong about you,
and I was wrong about me.
That big fella, I would've
killed him if I could've.
I would've killed all of them.
You and me,
we are the same blood.
I'm filled with fear,
John Henry.
You're gonna be fine, Pop.
No, no, not for me.
I'm fearful I'm gonna lose you.
I can see what's in your eyes.
Then you know what I gotta do.
You don't have to do anything.
But we both know I will.
I'll get the doc.
John Henry Clayton, you stop.
John Henry, please.
Please...
for me...
don't.
This ain't gonna end, Pa,
till someone ends it.
Not you. It doesn't
have to be you.
It's time I did something
right in my life.
This is what I know how to do.
Mr. Parsons, in that a LeMat?
Yes, sir.
I bought it off a fella
about a month ago.
She's a real beaut, ain't she?
Nine shots in a 10 gauge
shotgun barrel.
And I can let you have
it for a fair price.
Or you can just borrow it.
I suspect you're the one
they call Little Ned?
That's right.
All you young 'uns who ain't
willing to die today,
I suggest you unarmed yourselves
and get.
Stay where you are, boys.
Goddamn you.
Fuck! Ah!
Mouth getting dry, Frank?
You offering to buy me a drink?
DAVE:
John Henry.
Whatever happens next,
I want you to know
I did not sanction that cowardly
act against your father.
Personally, I found their
actions damnable
and deserving of the fate
you brought upon them.
Then you'll be leaving?
Can't do that.
No one hires a gunman
who runs from trouble.
You don't have to run, Dave.
You can walk.
The terms of my employment
would not allow me to do that.
This here LeMat's mighty heavy.
Puts me at a disadvantage.
What would you suggest?
Would you be kind enough
to let me go back inside
and retrieve myself a Colt?
Thank you.
My friend,
you are no longer employed.
It would appear you are correct.
It's been a pleasure
knowing you, Dave.
I'm all right, Pa.
It's not gonna take long
for word to get out on
what happened here today.
Men from far and wide are
gonna come looking for me to
make a name for themselves.
Don't go away. I can't
finish the field on my own.
The field's finished, Pa.
I seeded it
It'll take care of itself.
gotta go.
You're not going for
another 10 years, are you?
No, I promise.
See you soon, Pa.
MALE NARRATOR:
Little is known
Some say he drifted down
to Coffeeville
where he was involved
in another altercation
But those accusations
were never proven.
The common view was
he moved westward
life
of quiet isolation.
What is known is that
when Mary Alice died
a few years later, he did not
attend her funeral.
However, many say
the following day,
a faded red ribbon was found
attached to her headstone.
Others in Fowler recounted
stories of seeing him
throughout the years
up until his father's death,
