Anita!
Coming.
Ready? Open the door!
Oh, I've been saving up
for you for a long time!
Come on, honey!
I'm a-waiting!
Happy birthday, Colonel.
Oh, darlin', darlin'.
Let's raise the flag
on the flagpole today, huh?
You know the rules.
No sidearms upstairs.
Birthday kiss. Yeah.
Take off your coat and stay awhile.
Come on, darlin'.
- A toast.
- A toast?
- A toast.
- Yeah, give me a drink. Sure.
Oh, you're such a pig.
Ah, yeah! Oink, oink, oink!
- You're one of the best.
- One year better and one year older.
Now, darlin',
what do you say, huh?
We're here to have a good time.
Come on! Come on!
I'll grab you, all right!
Come here, you. Here I go.
- Whoo.
- That kiss now.
- You don't want to do business with me, Colonel.
- I want that kiss!
Where you goin'?
- There they go again.
- What the hell's goin' on?
God-fearin' citizens of this fine town...
...ain't it about time we stop lettin'...
...the sad morality
of a pernicious few sinners...
...bring shame upon us all?
Time to put a stop to the drinkin'...
- Yeah!
- And the gamblin'...
And the whorin'...
...right under our very noses.
Hey, preacher. You come up here.
We think we might could
change your mind.
Man's entitled to a drink
every once in a while.
My father, he'd have his drink
on Saturday nights.
Worked hard all week long.
There's nothing wrong with that.
They say it says in the Bible...
You had two already.
Whoa! Hold on there! Where are you going?
We didn't finish yet.
- You've had too much to drink.
- I ain't got my birthday kiss yet.
You're gonna plant it
right here, honey.
You... Come on now.
I'm gonna take you to...
- It's all right. Come on.
- Come on, darlin'...
- That's the one I wanted.
- Oh, boy.
- You stay away from me.
- No, whore!
Cody! Cody!
- Help me!
- Damn whore!
Now keep your hands off her, Colonel.
I paid for a goddamn birthday kiss!
I'm gonna get one!
You touch her again, you're a dead man.
She shot him!
The whore shot the colonel!
Get her!
Harlot! Get her!
She shot the colonel! She shot him!
Get her! Get her!
You okay?
The good Lord sayeth
an eye for an eye, a life for a life.
Lord, let this jezebel
be damned to death!
Harlot, you cannot escape
the wrath of our Lord!
I accuse you ofharlotry.
I accuse you of destroying
the sanctity of marriage.
I accuse you ofbringing sin
and disease to this town.
You have blackened the sun
and bloodied the moon!
- String her up.
- I accuse you of having a scorpion between your legs...
...that destroys man's covenant with God!
Cleanse yourself with death!
Free yourself from
your sinful enslavement!
Just get on with it.
And let us pray.
O God...
Jesus has said...
...every tree is known by its fruits.
This woman has
brought forth bad fruit.
And we pray unto you today, Lord,
to bless us...
- As we rid our fair community of this woman.
- Hyah! Hyah!
This abomination.
This scarlet temptress...
- who is ruining our town.
- Get out of the way!
I say unto her, the day of wrath is at hand.
Seems more like a lifetime
than three years.
I'm not exactly...
...your blushing bride anymore.
I know you don't
hold it against me, but I do.
At least I never let
another man kiss me.
I'll always have you in my heart.
If nothing else, at least that's sacred.
Let's go. If we don't put ground between us
and Echo City, we won't be going anywhere.
Hey there. We're with the Pinkerton
Detective Agency. Wonder if you could help us.
We're looking for
a Miss Mathilda Clayborne.
That's her in the buggy.
Thank you.
But they...
They are way the hell...
...out of my jurisdiction
by now, Mrs. Clayborne.
If you were anything more than a pile of
manure with a badge on it...
...my colonel might still be alive.
Well, I didn't put no gun
to your mister's head...
...and make him jump that whore!
Bitch.
We came as soon as we got the wire, ma'am.
Sorry about your husband.
You're wasting time. I'm hiring you because
what passes for the law around here...
...won't leave this jurisdiction.
I want that filthy harlot killed
or brought back to me, no matter what.
I had these drawn up.
That's just a taste of what you'll get
when you bring her back.
Sonny, you want to get our mounts off
the horsecar back of the train.
- Yes, sir.
- Don't you worry, ma'am.
You just point us which way they went.
We'll track 'em all right.
Okay. Lift it. Higher.
Okay. Ease it down.
That should do it.
Cody!
The wagon!
You all right, sweet pea?
Well, might as well eat this too.
Yeah. You can't tell
the one meat from the other.
Yeah, just like men.
So, are we gonna find
another saloon somewhere?
I'm finished with that.
So am I.
What have you got there?
Is that a stock certificate?
It's a homesteader's claim to 640 acres
in the Oregon Territory.
- Jim and I had it together. It's what we came out west for.
- What's it worth?
A lot of hard work, and then what you gotta
farm unless the bank takes it away.
We were gonna start a sawmill.
A sawmill?
Yeah. All the settling out here now...
...means more schools and saloons,
churches, houses.
- That means lumber.
- Now how come you never told us about this before?
I don't know. I...
I didn't know how I was gonna do it
all by myself.
What I mean to say is I'd like it if...
...you-all would go in with me.
Together we could do it.
We could run a business.
A sawmill?
We sold our bodies.
Why can't we sell some wood?
Might as well cook that thing some
more. Ain't gonna hurt to burn it none.
I suppose not.
Takes money.
Building a sawmill takes money.
I know. I'm probably just dreaming...
...but it's the closest thing
to a plan we've got.
Well, it could be I got some.
In Agua Dulce.
Been wiring it there for years.
Over $12,000 now.
Wha... Tw...
What are you saying?
I'm saying sawmill.
Why the hell not?
Yeah. Why the hell not?
A sawmill.
Well, as long as I don't have to
get any splinters in my fingers.
Oh, Eileen.
This stuff's... Raunchy.
That's why they call it rotgut.
Oh, it hits you quick.
Maybe a day old.
They was pullin' a wagon.
If it don't rain, won't be hard
picking 'em up.
Morning, ma'am.
Now don't go firing that thing.
I just want to show you something.
I must say the likeness
doesn't do you justice.
Yeah. That's me all right.
Uh, my name's McCoy. Joshua McCoy.
Where are you headed, Mr. McCoy?
I'm a prospector, see.
These hills are too picked-over.
I... Thought I'd make my way up north.
I've seen prospectors.
You don't look like a prospector.
Oh, I am. Truly am.
I'm countin' on making a big strike soon.
Soon as I get some things taken care of.
Now you wouldn't be thinking this reward
here would be part of your stake, would you?
No, ma'am. I'm just riding
in the same direction as you.
All right. Put on your hat
and be on your way, Mr. McCoy.
Only if you put your clothes on.
- Get movin'.
- Ma'am.
One more thing. They put Pinkertons
on your trail. You best keep movin'.
Pack everything on horseback.
We're leaving the wagon.
What about all our things?
Leave 'em. We gotta be
in Agua Dulce by tomorrow.
- Yes. May I help you?
- Yeah.
I want to buy a dress.
Um, just what kind of dress
did you have in mind?
One of them ready-to-wear kind
like you see in that Sears catalog.
I really think a woman like you would be
happier shopping someplace else.
Hyah! Come on. Hyah!
Morning, ma'am.
Good day, Mr. Landaker.
- I believe you dropped this, madam.
- Oh, why, thank you, sir.
- My pleasure.
- I'm new here. If it wouldn't be too much trouble...
...could you suggest a respectable place...
...where I might have a meal
and a decent libation?
Now, I just might know of such a place.
How dare you cast
such lewd and salacious aspersions...
...upon my person.
But that might be interesting.
Eileen, you don't gotta
whore yourself...
...at the first old fart that comes along.
- Silly child.
- Tramps, the both of you!
Ah, Lilly!
Can't you tell I...
I was just trying to get somethin'...
...passable to eat.
Oh, yeah? And I'm Wyatt Earp.
Can I have a kiss, Wyatt Earp?
- Don't you pucker up to me, Eileen.
- Come on. Come on.
Eileen.
Uh, well.
How can I help you, madam?
I would like to close out my account.
Uh... Pardon me.
I... I don't believe I know you.
You... You have an account with us?
Oh, yes. I set it up six years ago,
and I've been wiring deposits ever since.
Miss Anna Lee Zamora.
Please come in, Miss Zamora.
- Thank you.
- Just have a seat right over there.
Now then, uh...
...if you don't mind, could I just, uh, take
a look at your bankbook?
Oh, I'm afraid
there's a bit of a problem.
You see, we had a fire.
And it was terrible. I... I just...
Well, I really can't say.
Uh... I do recall signing
something some time ago.
You must have my signature
on file somewhere.
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.
Let's go in here.
- We're with the Pinkerton Detective Ag...
- I can see that.
We're following a harlot
name of Cody Zamora.
She killed a fella up in Colorado Territory.
- She's riding with a bunch of other whores.
- Yep. These are some bad girls.
This one rode in this morning
with three others.
It's, uh, very unusual
to carry an account like this.
And, uh, there's
considerable funds in your account.
$12,432, I believe.
- Why, yes. A little more with the interest.
- How lovely.
- Cody!
- Hold on.
- Not now.
- You gotta listen to me. Excuse me.
- See here, young lady.
- This is my sister.
- Pinkertons!
- Lilly, get!
She belongs to you, does she?
It's all right, Jenkins.
- It's all right.
- Yes, sir.
I am so sorry.
Oh. My sister, she's a little...
Nita, those Pinkertons. They're here.
Come on.
Here you go.
Cody. Cody. The Pinkertons are comin'...
Wrong, darlin'. The Pinkertons are here.
Miss Zamora, if you'd come with me.
- Get her.
- Come on.
Get off of me!
Cody!
Get up.
Drop the gun.
Drop it.
You too.
Move it!
Inside!
- Move!
- Aw, hell.
That's far enough, fat man.
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.
Come on! Come on!
Get in there. Get in there.
You heard him.
Cody?
Well, kiss my sister's black cat's ass!
What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm making a withdrawal.
- So are we, darlin'.
How much you taking out?
Well, give the lady her money, fat man.
Move it!
Thanks, Kid.
For old times.
Boss.
We've got it all. Let's ride.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's get out ofhere now!
- Ah. Hold. Hold.
- Eileen, get your behind on that horse.
What the hell you think
I'm trying to do?
You know where to find me, darlin'.
You son of a bitch!
- Shit!
- Eileen, come on!
Stop!
Cody!
Come here.
Come here, you tramp.
- Get your hands off me!
- You're up to somethin', you little tart.
- Damn it!
- Stand still!
You. William Tucker.
- I'm deputizing you.
- I gotta get on back to my place.
Well, I gotta form a posse
and get after them stinkin' Jarretts.
Now you put that down
and take her over and lock her up.
You think you can do that, Deputy?
- I heard you twice the first time.
- Well, then, goddamn it, do it!
And then get yourself fixed up.
Yeah, all right, boss.
All right.
Who's gonna volunteer for the posse?
Come on. We gotta get 'em
before they cross the river.
- I'll go, Marshal.
- Damn stranger's the only one of you with guts?
It's your damn money they stole.
You just gonna stand there
and take it?
All right. That's better.
Let's mount up.
You feel like a big man?
I feel like my damn shoulder hurts.
Why don't you sit down? Act like a lady.
Tucker, watch her.
I'm going to the damn doctor.
William.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Come closer. Please.
- Do I look like a criminal?
- No, ma'am.
I ain't no bank robber.
I ain't no deputy.
Why don't you just let me go?
I'd like to. I really would.
But I can't.
I'm sorry.
Ma'am, you shouldn't
oughta carry on like that.
Oh, God. For heaven's sake.
Now, you see, when the marshal gets back,
he'll straighten everything out.
We ain't gonna follow 'em?
We ain't the law over there.
We go back.
Are we gonna get her out?
- Are we gonna get Eileen?
- How are we gonna do that?
I don't know, but we got you out
when they were gonna lynch you.
Well, now, that was lucky.
Look, I don't let
my friends get hung.
I want her out just as much as you.
They're not gonna hang her.
- So rest easy.
- Do nothin'?
- Shit.
- I'm goin' to Kid Jarrett.
- I figure he's our best chance.
- Kid Jarrett's our best chance?
That son of a bitch
was nothing but trouble to you.
- That was a long time ago.
- Yeah, and this morning all he did was steal our money.
That's Kid's way of inviting me
to come over and see him.
Hell of an invitation.
Look. You don't know him. He's bored.
He'll give us back our money and spring
Eileen from jail just for the hell of it.
You're rating yourself
awful high, Cody.
I ran with that gang.
I know what I'm doin'.
- Where the hell you goin'?
- With you to Kid Jarrett's.
You don't go anywhere near Jarrett's.
Do you understand me?
I'm goin' with ya, Cody.
I'm warnin' you. You stay put.
You don't do what I tell you,
you're both out.
Hey.
New Orleans. My daddy had a big house...
...in the Quarter.
That's the French Quarter.
Parlez français?
Excuse me?
It's French.
It's the language
of love, you know.
Oh, I didn't know the language of love
had words, ma'am.
Oh, my, yes.
I could teach you.
Huh?
French. I could teach you French.
Oh. Of course.
So you're a rancher.
I got a couple dozen
head of longhorns.
- Cattle rancher.
- Yes, ma'am.
Nearby?
Why, yes. Actually, about 16 miles
out on North Road.
- It's a beautiful piece ofland.
- Huh.
It's called the Circle Bar "T."
Circle Bar "T."
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's a nice name.
Rico!
You can no come here, señorita.
Cody Zamora.
Cody Zamora.
Bueno.
Déme su pistola.
¡Hola, señorita!
You here to keep the boys happy?
It's been a long time, Cody.
It's been a long time, Frank.
Yeah.
Kid said you were back in Texas.
Did he tell you he stole my money?
- He said you'd be comin',
- Damn right.
That money is our stake for a new start
in the Oregon Territory.
Yours and whose, darlin'?
Me and some friends. One of us got
a homesteader's claim.
Oregon.
- I ran that once.
- Now why didn't I see you at the bank?
I got what I need right here.
Mucha tequila.
Muchas bonitas.
Well, Kid's still hungry.
Yeah. Thinks he can make a bigger name
for himself than his old man.
Always did want what I had...
...didn't he?
Well, look who's here.
We got us some
talkin' to do, Kid.
Let's talk.
I'll see you around, Frank.
Playing with the big guns now, Kid?
- You know I always did like
playing with things. - Mm-hmm.
You're taking trains too, I see.
Military shipment. Selling
U.S. Army guns to Juarez.
It's funny what you can find out
when you're running pinoche...
...to the army colonels
over at Fort Clark, right, Jack?
By Friday, I'll be
up to my ass in Mexican gold.
I'll bet you will.
Vete.
Vete!
- So what's on your mind?
- You invited me.
- Well, didn't you want to come?
- For the old days.
Remember when we went riding
with that bunch down to Tucson...
...running those guns into Durango?
- You remember that?
- We had us some times, didn't we?
You lying bitch.
You just come here for your money.
Oh, now, what's
the difference, Kid?
You're gonna be up to your ass
in Mexican gold by Friday, right?
That's right. What's 10,000
one way or the other?
$12,432. Why don't you just give it to me,
and I'll be on my way.
Look, I was only playing with ya.
You can have your money.
Keep the change.
Thanks, Kid.
What makes you think Oregon is
gonna be any different, hmm?
A new start for an old whore.
Why don't you just say it, Kid?
You're still sore at me for running out.
Sore? Now, why would
I be sore? Hmm?
Because you run out on me in the middle of
the night without saying a word? Hmm?
I'll see you around.
She ain't coming back.
- She is so.
- I'm going to get Eileen. Are you with me or not?
- When Cody comes back and we're not here...
- Don't worry about it.
She'll wait.
Lilly.
Don't hurt me.
There's no chance of that.
Electric chair? If you ask me...
...it'd be a hell of a lot cheaper
just to hang 'em.
- That way, you can use
the rope over and over again.
- What's that?
- Huh?
There. That's that whore.
That ain't her. You're drunk.
- She's been beaten.
- Here.
- Can you help her?
- Here.
Her back.
Her back was beaten.
Aw, hell. Why we gotta walk all the way
the hell down here for?
Because she's in one of
these tents. I seen her.
You ain't seen her.
I say we go right across the street...
...and get our bell ropes pulled.
I thought we were off duty.
We ain't ever off duty.
Psst. Hey, fellas.
You those fellas
after that whore from Echo City?
What's it to ya?
You seen her?
Well, now, it depends.
That poster talked about a reward?
Well, could be there's
a real big reward.
- Could be I know where that whore is right now.
- Where'd that be?
Where'd that reward be?
$500 wired to you when we get her.
My word as a Peckerton Ditinctive.
$500 is more than I'm used to.
All right. I seen that whore Cody riding
up river not an hour ago.
- Well, hell, why didn't you do something?
- She's with Kid Jarrett.
Are you sure it were Kid Jarrett?
Sure enough. I'd of done something too,
but I ain't no Peckerton Ditinctive.
Hell, Cody Zamora and Kid Jarrett.
Powerful...
...gunpowder heal wound.
Okay. Okay.
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.
- Tucker.
- Yeah, what do you want, Earl?
Get out here, Tucker.
- What are you doing?
- Interrogating the prisoner.
Well, you ain't trained for that.
I'll take over.
I'm making some
real good headway there, Earl.
Your ranch is waiting on you, boy.
I expect that can wait
a good while longer.
Now, I been talking to her.
She ain't no bank robber.
In fact, she's a real fine lady
from New Orleans.
Tucker, you go home now.
Um, I'm turning myself in.
- Say what?
- I was with the gang that robbed the bank.
Oh, I can't take it anymore.
Maybe you oughta sit down.
Eileen.
- It's about damn time.
- Here. Tie this on.
Y'all don't know how hard
it is being hunted.
Men wanting you everywhere you go.
I just wanna be safe.
What are you doing standin' here?
Go and question the prisoner, son.
- William.
- Yes.
- How would you like to kiss me?
- Excuse me?
First, they hurt me right there.
- Mmm.
- And then...
- They hurt me right there.
- Mm-mm-mm-mm.
Ma'am, those may be severe injuries,
but I don't see any marks.
Perhaps if you just
move it up a little bit.
- Oh!
- Shit.
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
- I've got more injuries.
- Show me later.
Gettin' me out in the middle of something...
Here's your chance to be a big hero
to someone in real trouble.
I swear, on my honor
as a Southern lady.
Get out of my way.
Hang on.
I didn't have anything to do with that
robbery. You're just gonna have to believe me.
- Move!
- Please, William.
- I don't know why
I believe you, but I do.
- You're doing the right thing.
- Yeah, sure.
- Come on. Get out.
- And you know what? For your own good.
- Wait! Wait! Hang on now!
- You're just gonna have to wait in there.
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, William.
You tell 'em that we held
a gun to your head.
- Eileen, come on.
- Let's go. You take care, William.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Come on. They was tryin'
to make me eat beans.
Hold up. Hold up.
- It's Cody's horse.
- See if you can find her.
- We'll be at the Circle Bar "T." Sixteen miles...
- Okay.
- Up the road next to Turtle Creek.
- Got it.
Let's go.
Don't worry, mister. Wife be okay.
Thank you.
Well, Mr. McCoy.
You seem to be my lucky penny.
It weren't no accident I was in Echo City
or that I tracked you here.
Word was you had a history
with the Jarretts.
I told you I was a prospector.
That's all true.
I'm on my way to the Klondike.
I got a claim there.
It could be worth a fortune in gold...
...but first I've got an old score
to settle with Frank Jarrett.
He jumped my father's claim,
then he killed him...
...and my ma was done
like-like you was.
She lived on a couple years.
I swore on her grave
I'd live to see Frank Jarrett die.
So you figured that Jarrett's whore
might lead you back to him.
Yes, ma'am.
That was the truth of it.
I didn't get our money.
Circle Bar "T," all right.
- This is big.
- Ha! This ain't so big.
This used to all be free-range.
Law of the land was the cattle could go
where they pleased.
You see that barbed wire?
That gave small ranchers like Tucker
a chance to get started...
...without being overrun by
the cattle from the big outfits.
You know, folks say the West
was conquered by the railroad.
Uh-uh. My daddy says
it was conquered by barbed wire.
Well, you sure know a lot about this for
a fine Southern lady from New Orleans.
Ah, Lilly,
I ain't from New Orleans.
I'd like to have been.
I grew up on an east Texas grub ranch
not much different from this one.
Well, I don't know much
about grub ranches...
...but this sure looks nice to me, Eileen.
It's got possibilities.
Well, ain't this sweet?
Little boy's gonna rob
an army choo-choo.
Gonna get hisself
a big, new toy gun, huh?
That gun's gonna make me rich, old man.
Oh, hi, William.
I hope you don't mind.
I kind of helped myself
to a few things.
I- I-I've made a really nice stew.
I wouldn't go in there if I was you.
Our friend's restin' in your bed.
Sure is nice of you
to let us stay here, Mr. Tucker.
Most kind.
Now, wouldn't you like some stew?
- I've made some pies.
- Sure smells good.
Hi. Joshua McCoy.
You got a real nice
spread here, William.
That's just great.
That's just great.
Why don't y'all just
make yourselves at home?
I been alone out here goin'
on a couple of years...
...since my family died.
I reckon you're the first company
I've had out here.
I guess I wouldn't
be much of a man...
...if I wasn't at least hospitable.
Welcome to my home.
The population of the United States
is over 63 million people now.
Well, they sure ain't here.
I better let you get some rest.
No, you can stay.
Well, I suppose
I don't wanna be alone.
That's funny?
Funnier than you know.
I suppose I'd like to stay.
May I have the pleasure of a dance?
Oh, I don't know.
Come on. You're not gonna
turn me down, are you?
Well, I don't... I don't
do a lot of dancin' out here.
I feel kind of silly.
You boys are making me very angry.
Now, let's not be shy,
and do what I told you.
That's it.
You boys are gonna be famous.
Tell your grandchildren you got
held up by Kid Jarrett.
- Here, I'll get it.
- Don't look so sad, boys.
You look good in your drawers.
You fools be careful with that thing!
That's precious cargo we've got there.
Shit! It's okay, boss.
Hyah! Giddap!
Now.
Up in the hills!
What are you doin', Jack?
Get this wagon out of here.
Okay, Boss.
Come on! Giddap!
- Where are you goin', Jack?
- Aah!
Roberto! Come back here and fight!
Yuma! Roberto!
You yellow dogs! Get back here!
Oh, damn!
Ned! Ned!
Ned, where you goin'?
Anita!
Get your yellow asses
back here, you cowards!
Oh, God.
- Can you get up?
- Yeah.
You dumb ass! Ain't nothin' but Cody
and a bunch of women!
Ha! Better go find your toy, sonny.
Where do you think you're goin'?
Put me down, you asshole!
Name of the man
that's killin' ya is Joshua McCoy.
Don't mean spit to me, boy.
Josh, they got Lilly. Kid's got Lilly.
- Cody.
- Bring him along. We'll trade him for Lilly.
I'm sorry, boss.
What happened to Jack?
You won't be seeing him no more.
What about you, Ned?
Tried my best, boss. Almost got
my ass shot off. Lost my damn hat too.
- Where's Frank?
- They got him and they got the guns...
...but we got this so we're
gonna make a little trade.
I seen one of these once
at the armory in Cheyenne.
God, it's heavy.
We trade Frank for Lilly.
When we get her...
...we give Kid this toy
and get our money back.
- This is not a toy.
- Let's get to work.
I can't believe we're even thinking
about doing this.
I can't stand to think of her there with
those dirty, disgusting men.
Only reason she's there is we went
running off after Kid in the first place.
Are you saying this is my fault?
All you care about is revenge on Kid.
You went with us, Anita.
You came along.
I never should've gone.
None of us ever should've gone.
None of this ever should've happened.
I shouldn't of let anything happen.
- We have no choice. We have to get Lilly.
- I know!
- Nita.
- Let her go.
Nita!
Nita! Nita!
Can I have some of that water, please?
Mighty thirsty.
Thank you.
Couldn't help but overhearing
about that land.
In Oregon, ain't it?
Grand territory, Oregon.
Spent a couple of years there once.
Lot of rain. Lot oflaws.
Don't like either.
Why are you talking to me?
Cody told me about your plans.
Sounds sweet.
It's just that I've never heard of no
single miss holding a claim for land...
...in Oregon, that is.
Well, just because you haven't heard of it
doesn't mean it can't happen.
Suppose not.
- Where is she off to?
- She's just riding off some steam.
She sure picked a good time
to pitch a fit.
If it were her in trouble, Lilly'd be
the first one to be there.
What's your name?
- Lilly.
- Just Lilly?
- Lilly's enough.
- Yeah, if you answer to it.
That depends on who's askin'.
You don't look much like a parlor house
girl in those pants and boots.
What's your family name?
- Laronette.
- Laronette?
I knowed a Roy Laronette. Seen him in
a Wild West show over in Del Rio.
- Best trick rider I ever seed.
- Is that a fact?
Well, how'd the daughter of a trick
rider wind up working in a parlor house?
He died... And the show
died with him.
It came up to me to pay off his debts.
Oh. Well, ain't you
daddy's sweet little girl?
- Sit her down.
- Sit down!
We got a real hellcat here.
May take some time breakin'her in...
...but it's gonna be a lot of fun doin' it.
This claim of yours
seems proper enough, young lady.
Why worry your little head?
Your husband seems to have
these matters well in hand.
What if my husband is deceased?
Ma'am, I don't quite know
how to tell you this, but...
Tell me what?
Well, your claim's worthless
without your husband alive.
See for yourself. Uh, second paragraph.
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but it's the law.
- Surely you understand that.
- Yes, I understand that.
I was worthless until I married,
so now I guess I'm worthless as a widow.
Funny. I had some value as a whore.
- Did I shock you?
- Well, no, ma'am, I...
You expect me to cry all over your big desk?
Well, to hell with that.
If your laws don't include me, well,
then, they just don't apply to me either.
Ma'am, that'll still be
six bits for my services.
Keep the change, you sawed-off fart.
Don't let him play with you.
Well, looky here.
My little whore finally
found herself a pretty boy.
Keep talkin'. That's all you can do.
There was a time I did a hell of
a lot more than talk to you.
You know where I found her?
She was scrubbin' floors
in a parlor house.
Wasn't more than 14.
She weren't contrary
like that back then.
No, sirree.
Got her real excited
being with a bunch of bandits.
My God, how she'd open up to me.
How she carried on.
Then you. Look at you.
A lovesick pretty boy.
Now after all these years
of wantin'to kill me...
She won't let ya.
Nothing's changed.
You're dead. I just ain't killed ya yet.
Hey, pretty boy! Come over here.
Come on over here.
I got somethin' to tell ya.
Yeah, you look just like your ma.
Real pretty.
Beautiful piece
of a woman, your ma.
Evangaline. Am I right?
Josh!
What happened?
He tried to escape. I shot him.
Did you shoot him before or after
you untied him?
I said...
...did you shoot him before
or after you untied him?
He brought it on himself.
He was playing you,
and you couldn't rein yourself in...
...and now we can't
trade him for Lilly.
Get the hell out of my sight.
Keep ridin' till you hit the Klondike.
Nita!
Sweet pea, where have you been?
- The claim's no good.
- What?
I went to a lawyer's office in town. He said
the claim's no good without Jim alive.
- Let's go get Lilly.
- Come on.
What are you lookin' at?
Pigs.
You know, you're gonna be
around here a while, girl.
You better be a little more friendly-like
and get to know everybody.
Over here is Rico.
This here is Ned.
Roberto.
This here's Yuma.
Me and Yuma go back a long ways.
- Isn't that right, partner?
- Long ways, Kid.
Go inside and get one of Cody's
old dresses out of my trunk.
Right away.
Have a drink.
Drink!
The more I think about it, it might
be nice having you around here.
Let those whores keep the old buzzard.
- Hey, boss.
- Not that one. The red one.
Get up.
Get up!
Take your clothes off.
Get in here.
- Damn it, boss!
- You keep your ass in there!
Least let us watch.
Put it on.
Ned. She's all yours.
Hello, girlie.
What do you say old Ned unties you,
and we can have some fun, huh?
You better kill me first...
'cause the only way
I'd lay with you is if I was dead.
It's Josh.
- Look again.
- Lilly? Oh, Lilly.
- Lilly, I've been so worried about you.
- You should've seen it.
It was crazy. Bombs going off everywhere.
Josh came in, attacked Kid's place.
Got me out of there. I was riding out.
- I looked behind me, but he wasn't there.
- Where is he?
I think they got him.
Where's the old man?
Dead.
Well, that is a shame.
What are you gonna do now?
- Where's McCoy?
- Oh, him.
He's here, but I wouldn't
worry about him.
He ain't dead... Yet.
- I'll buy him.
- You ain't got enough money to buy him from me, darlin'.
Well, now, you don't have
a Gatling gun, do ya?
That is true. That is true.
- Just show me the gun.
- Show me McCoy.
Tráelo!
I've shown you mine.
You show me yours.
Can I offer you ladies a drink?
Go get it.
Kid!
- Now, hurry up.
- Yeah, boss!
Come on.
Open that up! Let's see
what we got there.
Hey, Lilly, welcome back.
Yes. Yes.
You want him?
Take him.
Josh.
Josh.
Oh, that's real sweet...
comin'from a heartless whore.
That's what you came for.
Now get your ass outta here.
Cody. Let's go.
Girlie.
You come back
and see old Ned, you hear?
We'll finish what we got started.
Lilly.
Cover me!
Lilly!
Cody! Here! Be careful! Here!
Just foolin'.
You don't think I'd shoot you
in the back, do you, darlin'?
I'm even out of bullets. I got no bullets.
Pick it up. Put it in. Die like a man.
You are a dumb whore.
Looks like you could use some help.
Yeah, I reckon I could.
You all set to go?
I guess.
I'd sure be mite pleased
if you decided to stay on...
...share this place.
Oh. Well...
William...
I think there's something
I need to tell you.
I know all about that.
It's all in the past.
It don't matter to me none...
- So you don't have...
- I'm no lady from New Orleans.
My daddy was a poor rancher.
Nearly worked himself to death...
...till the bank came and took it all away.
I told myself...
I'd get away from
that damn dirt pile...
...and marry me a rich gentleman.
I was so stupid.
All I ever got was a...
couple of fancy dresses...
...and a broken heart.
I got this land. I ain't got no money.
But I swear...
I'll never break your heart.
- Oh! Geez! That's my arm.
- Sorry.
It's your share. You earned it.
Consider it a wedding present.
I got everything I need right here...
...but I'll take it.
Well, the rest of it's here...
...all except the $12,432,
which belongs to us.
You should stay. When that money
gets back to Agua Dulce...
I expect y'all are gonna be
big heroes in these parts.
We ain't heroes.
Well, it's time to go.
There's a gold mine in the Klondike
waitin' on some hard work.
That's a long way.
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, sweet pea.
See you. Take good care of her.
She's two handfuls,
but I'm gonna hang on.
Eileen.
- Hey, you'll see her again.
- It ain't likely.
Love you.
Let's ride.
Oh, Lilly, I love you all the way
to the moon and back.
That's not gonna change.
She killed a fella
up in Colorado Territory.
Sorry, son. The only female I seen in
the last month is that mare over there...
...and she's starting
to look pretty good to me, ain't she?
Yeah.
Hey, what's that
you're drinkin' there?
- Tennessee sippin' whiskey.
- Come on.
