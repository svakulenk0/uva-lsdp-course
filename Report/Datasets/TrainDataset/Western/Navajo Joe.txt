All right, get them!
Damned Indian.
He's still on ourt rail.
Stupid, you're simply
wasting your fire.
Go ahead, Jim.
You know what to do.
Go over that way.
Why didn't you let me handle it?
One shot and I'd have
finished him off.
By this time I'd already be bringing
you back his scalp.
Maybe he would've had yours.
You're just too stupid.
You're real smart, brother,
aren't you?
Just like a true half-breed.
Be careful, brother.
I won't ever let anyone call
me a bastard.
Hey, look over there!
Look at that, Duncan.
They got a price on your head,
your brother's too.
Dirty cowards.
We come to sell scalps and that's
the welcome we get.
Yeah, they're crazy.
The sheriff must have
made a mistake.
Yeah, well then, we'll just have
to set him straight.
Two hundred, Jeffrey, that's more...
than you're worth.
Hey, don't throw it away, Duncan.
We'll set fire to the whole town
with that piece of paper.
We're gonna have a little fun.
They're really gonna pay for this.
We'll show them all right,
won't we boys?
Come on.
Hey, one minute there.
No, no. You got to check
your guns first!
You must be joking, with all those
tough characters in there.
Hey, mister, don't get excited. You
can keep us as hostages.
-What good will that do?
-Plenty.
If you pull up a couple of
chairs for us...
then we can keep you company, huh?
You wouldn't want to keep us
standing here, would you?
All right. I'll get a few chairs.
Thank you.
No, afteryou.
Well, come on, boys.
This friendly little visit
isn't over yet.
I have an idea.
We'll have to give this town a reason
for collecting that reward.
We didn't do it. It was
the sheriff's idea.
The sheriff, huh? Where is he?
I'd like to speak to him.
I'm right over here, Duncan.
What do you think you're doing?
Just why have you come here?
You know damn well.
We've been bringing you lndian
scalps for years.
You paid us good then, Sheriff.
That ain't against the law.
What's happened?
Those days are through.
The scalps you brought then were
those of troublemakers.
Now you're attacking peaceful
tribes, killing...
even the women and the children.
This is murder, Duncan, and
I must forbid it.
All lndians are the same to me,
a bunch of red bastards.
Show him the scalps, Monkey.
Here.
And there's more where
these came from.
Now, listen to me, Duncan.
I've warned you.
No sale! Just come along with us.
Duncan, I'm arresting
you for murder.
Get up!
Go open up the jail, Sheriff.
Nice shot!
Your boys are in top
form, my friend.
Well, well. Look who's here.
You've changed since you were
in that rotten prison.
And you, you haven't
changed at all, Duncan.
You're still selling out cheap.
Still satisfied with a dollar a
scalp, like before.
It's a personal hobby.
And what about you?
You still make a living out of
saving helpless women?
No. I'm also a doctor, remember?
And now I've gotten started in...
banking.
Banking?
The name Blackwood mean
anything to you?
Sure.
They're rich. The ones that own
the bank in town.
But I don't think they mean
anything to you.
They mean a great deal.
Blackwood's a banker and I've
married his daughter.
You don't say?
I'm pretty influential now.
How about putting me on
the payroll, amigo?
Well, I just might have an
opening for a teller.
Look, I have a proposition that
might interest you.
There's a train due to arrive
in Esperanza...
with half a million dollars
on board.
All you have to do is
hold up the train.
When the job is done, both
of us will be rich.
Or I'd be rich alone.
No, don't count on it.
You can't do it without me,
my friend.
That money is locked up in
an armored safe.
lf you're thinking of using
dynamite charges,...
you'd blow up the safe, all right,
and the money along with it.
But I know the combination
on the lock,...
so I could open it nice and easy.
Hold up that train and then meet
me at Hot Springs.
I'll be there tomorrow.
You won't have to run around chasing
these stinking lndians anymore,
just for a few lousy dollars.
And I'll be able to get the hell
out of this miserable town
and head back to Europe.
You must really be in love
with your wife.
Of course I am.
It's easy to love a woman who's
such a solid investment.
But as far as the pleasures of
matrimony are concerned,
well, that's another story.
-That's it.
-Come on!
Let them fight!
Come on!
Come on, girls. Hurry up!
Get up there!
Don't let those girls get away.
Larry, stop them!
-Right, Duncan.
-Make it fast.
You boys come with me.
Hey, boys, let's go! Get
on those horses.
We got to stop them.
Don't let those girls get away!
Duncan, wait. That lndian!
He got two more of our men.
Come on, we'll finish him
off this time.
Later. We've got something else
to take care of now.
Geraldine's been hit!
You saved our lives, mister.
We're very grateful.
Don't think that we'll forget what
you've done for us.
I didn't kill them for you.
Listen, mister, in Pyote, we overheard
Duncan and a man from Esperanza...
gabbing about some train robbery
they're setting up.
Geraldine could recognize
the other fellow,...
but they shot her.
It's the train that passes
through Esperanza.
They've about half a
million dollars...
onboard in one of the cars.
The bandits have arranged to meet
back in Hot Springs.
There's still time to stop
that train.
Here. There's a chance
you can help.
I don't know. Just why do I have
to take that chance?
It's a long ways to ride.
Maybe I'll go back.
Now, get to Esperanza.
Let's go!
We've got to get back to a doctor.
She's bleeding a lot.
Dear, dear. Hush.
I know I'm going to love
this country.
How beautiful the mountains are.
Do you think he'll like it,
too? I'll let...
the little fellow have a look.
I'm sure he'll love it here.
-King!
-Jack!
I'm through.
You've cleaned me out.
Never mind that.
You can help yourself from
that safe inside.
-It's your turn.
-That's yours, Bill.
Stop! Stop the train!
-What for?
-Logs! They're blocking the track!
Brake, damn it! Brake!
-Give me a hand.
-Hold on, I'm coming.
Look at that.
That was a close one.
Hey, give me a hand here.
-What happened?
-Can't you see for yourself?
-Watch out.
-What did we stop for?
There's some logs on the tracks.
We have to clear them off.
Oh, it's all right.
Robledo, halt!
Well, looks as though the
man wasn't lying.
You can smell those dollars.
Now all we gotta do is wait
for our friend.
Search all the carriages. Make
sure we got everybody.
Cover the other side.
Don't cry. Don't cry.
No!
We said no witnesses, remember?
You boys better decide what
to do with the kid.
-Everything's quiet so far.
-Good.
Change the guard every two hours.
-You understand?
-Right.
I'm gonna go
on a drunk for a month...
with my cut of the money.
I'm gonna buy me a ranch and breed
me some horses.
Well, there's no sense
speculating now.
We can make our plans when our
friend comes tomorrow.
Just tell me one thing. Why do we
have to wait around?
Why couldn't he come and open
the safe tonight?
It'd be too risky.
He's too well known around here.
He has to have an alibi.
Just shut up and go to sleep!
Hey, you got a match?
What's the matter?
Yeah, hey, listen a minute.
Could you please tell us where
we could find a doctor?
Dr. Lynne's at the station
with the others.
Then please take us to the station.
Citizens of Esperanza, we have
assembled here to welcome
a very special train that will be...
arriving with its precious load.
I hope you know how precious.
You're all quite aware what
it means to us all
to receive this grant of $500,000
from our state.
This gift offers all of us
definite advantages.
And all this will mean a great
deal to our town.
And may we now acknowledge
the efforts
of our distinguished mayor,
Mr. Jefferson Clay,...
to whom we sincerely offer our thanks,
and we are also very grateful to
Sheriffs Reagan and Johnson
for their aid.
Our appreciation also goes to the
manager of our local bank,
Mr. Oliver Blackwood, and to
his daughter, Hannah,
beloved wife of our very competent
and highly esteemed Dr. Lynne.
Whoa! Whoa, there!
Hurry. Help me, Maria!
-Gently.
-Easy now.
Be careful.
And we are very proud of
all you've done.
Reverend Rattigan!
What's the matter, Estella?
We need the doctor now! A
girI's been wounded.
-Let them through.
-Oh, the poor girl.
-Clear the way.
-What happened?
Put her in that room.
-Yes.
-Hannah, get my bag, quickly.
You find it, Estella. He put it in
the carriage out front.
I can hardly believe what I saw.
Those men are ruthless.
First, they terrorized Pyote,
then they tried to kill us.
Now calm down.
You're in no danger here.
The train will get here in a little
while with an armed escort.
The soldiers will defend us.
Don't worry about Geraldine.
There couldn't be a better man
than Dr. Lynne.
Let's pray there's still time to
save her, poor child.
Hemostat.
But who was
this other man?
I don't know. From where I was hiding
it was impossible to see his face.
Geraldine's the only one of us that
managed to get a good look at him.
She could recognize him.
Oh, no, it's you.
The man I saw in the saloon.
Oh, you...
No!
It's too late.
Let's go now.
Geraldine.
Hey, there's nobody on the train.
Who's that?
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Answer me!
Who are you?
I brought you a train.
Yes. Yes, but why? What happened?
It's already cost many lives.
To try and save your lives, I
had to take the train.
Duncan's riding here.
With all of his men.
Wait.
How did you get it?
By stealing the train.
I told you.
Where is the money?
There, the train.
Come on, we'll make sure.
The safe should be in here.
Easy.
I'll open it.
Looks all right so far.
It's all here.
Then we should take it to the bank
as quickly as possible.
Well, it looks as though that man
was telling the truth.
lf Duncan comes after that money,
we don't stand a chance.
I don't think he'd dare come here.
And besides, there's the telegraph
if we need assistance.
Mr. Clay! Mr. Clay!
Somebody's cut the telegraph wires.
The line went dead, just as I was
receiving a message from Wellington.
They reported that Duncan and
his men completely...
destroyed the town of Pyote.
We gotta do something quickly...
or those bandits are going to
do the same to us.
Well, what can we do?
You realize now it's impossible
to call for any help.
But we can't just wait around until
those bandits ride in and kill us.
You've got to organize some sort
of defense, Sheriff.
There doesn't seem to be much we
can do, Mrs. Lynne.
You know perfectly well
we're not equipped
to stop Duncan and his gang.
We here in Esperanza, thank God,
are a peaceful community.
There's not a gun in town.
We're totally helpless.
You shouldn't give up so easily.
There's one way to get rid
of your problem.
What?
Kill him.
Sure. Why didn't we think of that?
This is no time to be making jokes.
Who do you suppose would be able
to kill that renegade?
Me.
For a price.
We don't make bargains
with lndians.
He's crazy.
Come on, we're wasting time
just listening to him.
But we still haven't decided
what to do.
Enough of this ridiculous talk.
Let's get that money out of here.
-And take it down to the bank.
-Just a minute.
This young man has just said that
he is willing to help us out.
It hardly seems that we're in any
position to refuse his proposal.
What are your terms?
I want a dollar a head
from every man in this town...
for every bandit I kill.
Plus the reward that's been offered
for Duncan and his brother.
Who do you think you're fooling?
You're stupid to trust him.
Nobody here is impressed
by all your boasting.
Get moving, lndian.
I said, get moving.
Why don't you try and move me?
Someone in your town helped
Duncan rob that train.
He's working with him.
He betrayed all of you once,...
and he could do it again.
You boys defend the train.
I'll go to Wellington to
ask for help.
We will need you to take care
of the wounded.
Let the sheriff go.
For my sake.
No, my dear, there's too
much at stake,
and I feel it is my duty to
go to Wellington.
I'll start right away.
Dust thou art, and to dust
thou shalt return.
Grant unto thy servant Geraldine
eternal rest, O Lord.
-Amen.
-Amen.
Chester.
Please be careful, darling.
Don't worry.
I'll be back.
I hope he makes it. He's
taking a big risk.
lf Dr. Lynne doesn't get here in
time with those men,
it'll be a massacre.
ln the meanwhile,...
just what are we going to do?
What are you complaining about?
You sent away the only man that
could've been helpful.
-That lndian? He was just a liar.
-Oh, yeah?
Well, if you had seen him kill those
three bandits the way I did,
you wouldn't speak that way.
Maybe it was a big mistake to
send that boy away.
Let's ask him to come back.
There's still time.
What do you want?
I said, what do you want?
My mistress sent me to see you.
Who is your mistress?
Dr. Lynne's wife.
Her father is the banker
of Esperanza.
But she's the one who
decides everything.
She thinks since you saved her
father's money once,
perhaps you can do it again.
She'll do anything you want.
And he'll pay the price you ask.
How did you know I was here?
I just thought you might be.
Who's lndian? Your father
or your mother?
My mother.
You're a Navajo, aren't you?
What's your name?
Joe.
I've never known an lndian
named Joe.
And I've never seen a Navajo
so far south before.
And me, an lndian girl that asks
so many questions.
Go back and tell your mistress that
I'll save her money for her.
One more thing.
I'll need some dynamite.
Don't shoot, Duncan!
I wanna talk to you.
Come here. I think you owe me
a few explanations.
What's to explain?
How that lndian scum filched the
train right from under you.
And now the $500,000 has
been locked...
up in the bank vault.
-That damned dirty lndian!
-Calm down, Duncan.
You can still help.
They're running around like a pack
of scared rabbits in town.
They think I've gone to Wellington
for help.
So what?
So you capture me...
and you take me to Esperanza.
We go to the bank, and you force
me to open the safe.
The money's there in the bank.
I know how to open the door.
Then you can give me my share.
Okay.
But be careful.
This is your last chance.
You sure he'll come?
What did he tell you, Estella?
What'll we do if he doesn't
show up?
Things will be just as bad
as before.
They'll be worse.
Damned lndian.
Do you think he'll come?
That's enough!
We can fight them ourselves!
All right, get up. We'll show them!
Go ahead.
Besides, we don't know if that
lndian's telling the truth.
It could be a trap.
Wait a second. Didn't he bring
us the money?
She's right.
I'm sure that Chester will make
it to Wellington.
And he'll come back here
with the Rangers.
Meanwhile, trust the lndian.
He'll guard us.
All by himself? An lndian?
Time was when we'd pay a
dollar for his scalp.
No, we need the Rangers.
Don't count on that.
They won't come.
Your man took the wrong way.
What do you mean?
You'll see.
I know that I'm the man you need.
And you're absolutely sure you can
fight that gang alone?
We won't be able to help you
at all, don't forget.
Aman who knows what he wants...
is worth a lot.
Well then, what do you want?
I told you, a dollar a head.
All right. You'll defend us.
And one other thing.
You the sheriff?
No, the deputy.
He's the sheriff.
What do you want?
-That.
-What?
You want us to appoint you as
sheriff, is that it?
That's right.
But you can't.
An lndian sheriff?
The only ones elected in this
country are Americans.
My father was born here,
in the mountains.
His father before him and
his father before him
and his father before him.
Where was your father born?
But what has that to do with it?
I said, where was he born?
In Scotland.
My father was born here,
in America.
And his father before him and
his father before him
and his father before him.
Now, which of us is American?
And that's mine.
It belongs to me.
Thanks.
-All right?
-Good.
Go home and stay there...
and keep out of my way.
Get me some dynamite.
Then I'll tell you what to
do with the money.
They're coming now.
The rotten filth.
Girls, don't move. Duncan's
in town.
lf he sees us, we're as
good as dead.
Good Lord!
Why, it was utter insanity to rely
on that lndian.
I hope Chester gets to Wellington.
By now, it's our only chance.
I don't know. Let's pray.
No tricks, Duncan.
Don't worry. You'll
get your half.
All right, where's the money?
Or were you lying all along?
I swear. It was here.
I don't understand.
-I saw it.
-You're a liar! Where's the money?
They must've hidden it somewhere.
But I'll find it.
Where is the money?
-I tell you, I don't know.
-Where's the money?
My wife will know where they hid
it. Give me time to talk to her.
Chester!
No! Oh, Chester.
No, ma'am, you must not go.
-No.
-Stay inside.
Chester!
Chester, no.
Darling.
Chester, the lndian has it all.
He hid it.
It's my fault.
-I gave it to him.
-So, all the money is with the lndian?
Forgive me, darling.
-Come here.
-No, let me go. No.
No, let me go.
Joe! Please help me.
Hey, lndian! Come out!
Come on out, do you hear me?
Throw your gun down, or I'm
gonna kill this woman.
-Can you see her?
-No!
She's an lndian like you are.
Get down here fast, redskin,
if you...
don't want this squaw to die.
What are you waiting for?
Slaughter him!
You hear me? Slaughter him.
He's got to talk.
You damned lndian.
Where did you put all that money?
Speak up!
You'll end up talking.
Sooner or later.
I know you'd rather get a slug,
but that's too simple.
First, you'll have to tell us where
you hid the money.
Now, will you talk?
Where's the money?
Talk.
That's enough, brother!
We'll never know where
the money is.
Corpses can't talk.
Leave him be for a while.
String him up by his feet.
You can get yourself a little
fresh air tonight.
Tomorrow, after you've had a good
rest, you and me will have our talk.
You frightened me, girl.
Next time you come, let us
know that it's you.
Or you might get an arrow
through the stomach.
We have to be prepared, in case one
of Duncan's men finds us here.
Well, I've really had it.
Let's get out of this town.
-What are we waiting for, Chuck?
-Me, too.
Why, the people here
are all cowards.
Didn't you see? No one even tried
to save that poor lndian.
You didn't do anything either.
But why have you come to us?
Please, help me save him.
He gave himself up...
to save my life.
He saved our lives, too,
remember, Chuck?
Yeah, of course I do.
Estella's right. There must be
something we can try.
Females!
Very well then, but I'll do it alone.
This is no job for women.
What are you doing here, huh?
-Me?
-Answer me.
I'm taking a little walk.
-Here?
-Sure, I'm just crazy about horses.
And you know what? I noticed that
white one has a limp.
-Are you sure?
-Look for yourself. Look.
You dirty little...
Help!
Help!
Thank you, friend.
Thank you.
They've let the lndian get away!
They're all going
to pay for this.
Listen to what I have to say.
lf by noon the money
hasn't turned up,...
expect everyone to die!
That's absurd. They're all innocent.
Nobody knows where it's hidden.
Well, somebody does.
I'll be waiting.
For the love of God, Duncan!
I've warned you!
-I'll be leaving.
-What do you mean?
I'll just be hiding.
But I need someone to bring those men
that are guarding the corral to me.
But not me, huh?
Some jobs a man can't do.
But the big blonde can
do it. Maybe.
Yes, that would be exciting.
But I don't murder men.
But he said nothing of killing.
All you have to do is get
him to follow you.
I'll do the rest.
Just leave it to us.
But I want you to live.
Why don't you go before
it's too late?
I have to finish what I've started.
Why do you hate Duncan so much?
lf it's not for the money that you
kill those bandits, then why?
Someday when you grow up,...
and don't ask so many questions,...
maybe I'll tell you.
Well, hello.
What are you hanging around
the corral for?
You know it ain't allowed.
Just as I passed here, this
garter unhooked.
I'd certainly appreciate a little
friendly assistance?
With pleasure. I know all about
these things.
It tickles. Thanks a lot.
You certainly are one
big barrel of fun.
Let's have a little kiss for
the hero, huh?
Oh, no, no. Not here.
Why don't you come to
my cabin later?
Don't be late now, and bring your
buddy for my girlfriend.
Wait! Wait!
Barbara, what happened?
-They're coming.
-Come on.
Coming?
I found two girls. Come on!
What about the horses?
Let them find their own girls.
Here we are, beautiful.
Go on, move. Get!
Barbara, they did it.
All right.
You want to finish your
days as sheriff?
Or are you gonna tell me?
Where's the money?
I don't know. I swear to you.
-But you let him get away.
-I don't know.
-No, I assure you.
-Come on, you know where. Start talking.
I swear. I don't know. I swear.
I swear to you.
All I know is that the telegraph gave
the alarm for the fire at Pyote.
You're all in danger. The
soldiers will be here.
Then get going. Go on.
You shoot, Jeff.
Did you all hear that outside?
Now it's time for three
more of you.
And if you don't decide to
talk, I'll kill you all.
One way or another.
Do you hear me?
One way or another.
Duncan, why are we
wasting time?
Let's kill them all and
get out of here.
Enough of this business.
What else can we do?
We better go back before the
army is all over us.
We'll leave exactly when I say
so, is that clear?
And I ain't leaving till I learn
what they did with it.
The soldiers will find a town
full of corpses.
I'm a man of God and I wouldn't
lie to save my own life.
We don't know anything about
the lndian or the money.
You've killed my daughter and
nothing matters to me anymore.
lf I knew anything, I'd tell you.
What's happening?
They've let the horses loose. And
here's a message from the lndian.
It was attached to an arrow.
We saw shadows and we attacked,
but he got away.
But they left your horse behind.
And where's the money?
It says in this note. He wants
it read aloud.
It's addressed to your attention.
Where is the money?
On the locomotive.
lf he hears another shot,...
he'll get on the train and take
it away with him.
Without horses, there's no way out.
We'll see.
Jeffrey, take my horse and ride
fast to the station.
lf you find the money, blow the
train whistle three times.
Then take off alone for Hot Springs.
We'll join you with the train.
Right away.
But why just him alone?
Because I say so!
We'll wait right here.
And if it's a trap,...
and none of this is true,...
I'm gonna set the church on fire
with all of you in it.
But for what reason?
That message is proof we know
nothing about it.
Speak to your heart. l
beg this of you.
Nobody ever had mercy on me.
When I was a boy they beat me,...
even called me bastard.
I didn't cry and I couldn't
fight back.
So that began my revenge
to get back at them.
Brought out my hatred for the
lndians, like my mother.
And to kill white people,
like my father.
My father, a preacher like
you, a minister.
Bred by mercy.
But I got a bad break when
somebody killed him
and beat me to the punch.
The signal! He found the money.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's go, you guys.
Thank you, Duncan.
For mercy and sparing our lives.
Look at that. They're
all going away!
Come on, hurry.
-Let me on.
-Let's get up.
-Give me a hand.
-Come on.
-All right, let's go.
-Hurry up.
-Everybody on there.
-All right.
-Move it out. Come on.
-All right.
Make this old crate move. We
have to reach Jeffrey fast.
You heard him, boys!
Look! The lndian.
What is it?
-Why are you shooting?
-Duncan! The lndian!
He's in front of the train. l
recognize his horse.
Come on, feed it some coal! We're
gonna catch that pig.
Come on, move!
He's yours, Duncan. Get him now.
Jeffrey.
I got to the train,...
found the cash, but the lndian
came from behind.
You, Sancho, come with me.
Duncan, hold it a minute.
Who knows where he's hiding?
We may be walking into a trap.
Go on, hero. Move.
It looks like a mine.
Go on.
Both of us.
You dig in here. Keep a look out.
Nobody.
Now we got him, behind the
rocks over there.
Duncan,...
we're in the open here.
He'll pick us off easy.
Get moving!
But I don't want to be killed.
Move, I said.
I'm getting out of here, and to
hell with the money!
Get back here!
Come back, you coward!
You won't escape now, redskin.
You sweating?
You all ready to give up now?
Come on out, lndian.
Come on out, you're finished.
You're through.
I'm too smart to fall
for that trick.
Come on out, lndian! It's all over.
I'll pin your scalp to my saddle!
That's foryou, filthy,
stinking lndian.
Come on, lndian. Come on out.
Or would you rather not come out
and rot for killing Jeffrey?
Damn you, lndian.
Face it, lndian. I outsmarted you.
Throw down your belt.
There you are.
You won.
You're real smart, hombre.
Why did you follow me?
Because you want to kill me?
I know you're a bounty killer.
You want to have my bounty. But you
can have the money, if you want.
But let me live.
You killed my brother.
Broke up my gang.
Let me live.
This belonged to my woman.
Do you remember her? Huh?
Okay.
You're gonna pay for her life.
It's our money.
The lndian kept his promise.
Where is he?
Who cares? The money is
all that counts.
-Take his horse to the corral.
-No!
Let him go.
He knows where to go.
Go back to him.
Go.
Go.
