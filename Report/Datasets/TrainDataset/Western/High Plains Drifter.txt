Yah! Let's go, buster.
Beer.
And a bottle.
Ain't much good.
It's all there is.
Will you want anything else?
Just a peaceful hour to drink it in.
Flea-bitten range bums
don't usually stop in Lago.
Life here's a little too quick for them.
Maybe you think
you're fast enough
to keep up with us, huh?
A lot faster than you'll ever live to be.
Yes, sir?
Shave and a hot bath?
That'll be 90 cents.
Cash.
Well, what I mean to say
is that the 90 cents
usually comes first.
But, hell, it don't really matter.
Before or after, what's the diff?
Sir.
Eau de lilac's only 10 cents more.
Lilac water.
Oh, the ladies love it.
Shall we make it
an even dollar? Hmm. No.
Yes.
Moses.
Right you are, gentlemen.
Be right with you.
Just have a chair.
What, you don't like our company?
What's the matter with you?
I'm speaking to you, pig shit.
I think he's got some of that pig shit in his ear.
I don't know
which smells worse,
him or the shit in the bottle.
What did you say your name was again?
I didn't.
No. I guess you
didn't at that, did you?
Why don't you watch where you're going?
Look at this.
It's ruined.
There's no need for all that.
All what?
If you
want to get acquainted,
why don't you just say so?
Acquainted?
Why, you'd be amusing if you weren't so pathetic.
Just a minute.
I'm not finished
with you yet.
You know, at a distance, you'd almost pass for a man.
But you're
certainly a disappointment
up close, aren't you?
To your feet, ma'am.
They're almost as big
as your mouth.
You know what you are?
Hmm?
Just trash.
A bottle of whiskey
for courage and the manners
of a goat.
You're the one who could use a lesson in manners.
Not from you, whiskey breath.
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let go of me!
Let go of me, you!
Put me down!
Help me!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
My horse.
A room.
Would you like to register, please, sir?
Somebody, please help me.
Damn you all to hell.
Good morning. Sleep well?
Yeah.
Say, are you planning to stay,
keep your room another night?
I'll let you know.
All right, anything you say.
Morning.
I've still got a bath coming.
Nice hot bath
coming right up.
Yes, sir.
Mordecai, you put some more hot water in that tub there.
This gentleman wants a bath.
You can hang your clothes right down there on the peg.
Now, Miss Peekins
does a nice...
Oh, I'm sorry.
MORDECAI: Right this way,
Captain, sir.
BARBER: Unless you want
Mordecai to take them out
and get them laundered while you're soaking.
Miss Peekins does a right clean boiled wash.
Uses lye
for pants rabbits, she does.
No itch, no scratch.
Well, pour the water, Mordecai, before it gets cold.
We want the gentleman to be comfortable.
Well, I've been wanting to talk to you.
I might as well get this stool here
and set right down and do it, right?
If that's all right with you, huh?
Well, what's it about is Billy Borders.
Don't know the man.
Well, you missed your chance,
'cause you shot him yesterday.
Him and Ike Sharp and Fred Morris.
You know,
those are just the names,
in case you're interested.
Well, I'm not really interested, Sheriff.
Well, I can't say I blame you, you know.
Billy, he wasn't a loved man, no.
And he didn't have much personality.
What he did have was all bad, just bad.
What you're trying to say is there's no charge, right?
Uh...
Well, forgive and forget, you know.
That's our motto.
You dirty bastard!
I'll kill you!
Damn it, Callie!
Callie, damn it!
Let go of me, you fat lug!
Stop... Ouch!
Tell him I'd appreciate it
if he doesn't leave town until I talk to him.
SAM: Goddamn it!
CALLIE: I'll kill you!
I wonder what took her so long to get mad.
Because maybe you didn't go back for more.
It don't seem to me that we got a choice.
Seeing we got no time to send for help,
and further seeing that our sheriff's
about as much use as tits on a boar.
Sorry I'm late.
Anything happen?
No, no, His Honor's had the floor.
In case you haven't heard it yet,
Stacey Bridges
and the Carlin brothers are
due to get out of jail today.
They coming here?
That's been their plan, according to all reports.
There's no reason to believe they've changed it.
Possibly they've repented their ways.
Preacher, they're gonna
burn this town to the ground
and you know it.
What we're talking about now is a way to stop them.
We gotta find that way now and quick.
Nevertheless,
my conscience will not
allow me to be a party
to the hiring of a professional gunfighter.
Well, maybe you'd like to go
out there and stand them off
yourself, Preacher.
I'm just a simple man of God.
Well, it's time we unsimplified you, Reverend.
Now, Borders,
Morris and Short were
professional gunfighters
on the payroll of the Lago Mining Company
to protect our interests and the interests of this town,
which are identical.
They stood around
drinking beer and looking
snotty for a full year.
And then one day before we actually needed the bastards,
they managed to get themselves killed.
So if you've got a suggestion,
we'd be delighted to hear it.
Otherwise, take your
conscience elsewhere while we
think about saving your ass.
Land's sakes.
Where's time gone to, huh?
Miss Peekins' eldest
is feeling poorly.
I promised I'd...
Will you gentlemen excuse me?
Well, we were talking about hiring a gunfighter.
Yeah, we don't know anything about that fellow there.
Well, we know he took the best we could find to hire,
like Grant took Vicksburg.
Yeah, with a hidden gun in his lap.
Three for three.
One right between the eyes.
Goddamndest shooting I ever even heard of.
I still say we're asking for trouble!
A fellow like that, what do we know about him?
Who is he?
Where does he come from?
Well, you've got our permission to go and ask him.
Although, the last three
that tried that didn't
fare all that well.
CALLIE: Let me out!
Put me down, you bastard!
Let go of me, you fat lug!
Get the hell off me!
Let go of me!
You fat pig!
Hey, come here.
What is this?
I was just down there sounding out that stranger,
when she come in there blasting away like a Cheyenne!
All right, Sam.
All right.
You're planning
to let him get away
with this, aren't you?
Be a little patient,
will you?
Patient?
Callie, when you run
across a man who's used
to having his own way,
you let him have it until he goes too far.
Just what do you consider going too far?
I mean, isn't forcible rape
in broad daylight
a misdemeanor in this town?
There's too much at stake
to throw away
on hysterics now.
Hysterics?
Well, I can remember
some hysterics one night
not too long ago.
Callie, keep your mouth shut!
Morgan, get her out of here.
I'll see you later.
Yeah.
Not while
that squinty-eyed
son of a bitch
is still breathing, you won't!
You wonder if there's a man left in this town!
I mean, one honest-to-God man
with a full set of balls!
Well...
Why not?
'Cause I'm not a gunfighter.
Oh, now, don't get fact
mixed up with stupid. You...
Besides, I have nothing against these men.
Who did you say they are?
Well, Stacey Bridges and his cousins, the Carlin boys,
they worked
for the company. They...
You know, what you call troubleshooters.
You know, just like those three you done in yesterday,
except when
they was here before,
there was lots of trouble.
And they took care of it, too.
Except, well, they got too damn big for their britches.
Started pushing people around,
and taking over the town
and we had to...
Had to what?
Well, we had to take them into custody, that's what.
Yeah.
I clapped the old bracelets
on them myself.
Hey, you won't be wanting that slab of pie, will you?
You know what happened, friend,
is they stole a golden ingot
out of the mining office
down there,
and they hid it under the floorboard
of the shack that they lived in.
Kind of careless
of them, wasn't it?
Huh?
I mean, does a mining company
usually leave gold ingots
lying around like that?
Well, it does seem a bit peculiar, you know.
Matter of fact,
Stacey kept bringing that up
at the trial all the time,
saying that he was being railroaded with.
And do you know that's why they're mad at us?
No, I'll tell you
what you can do, Sheriff.
What?
When those boys come back to town,
you just clap the bracelets right on them.
Me?
Yeah.
Well, I might have forgot to mention
that they were
all three passed out
at the time, you know?
Look, I'm no lawman.
You know, they just hung this thing on me
when that young Marshal Duncan was killed.
You know,
he was whipped to death
right here in this street.
Bullwhipped.
Damndest thing I ever saw.
Now, why would anybody want to do a thing like that?
Well, I don't know.
It wasn't anybody
from this town, anyhow.
How do you know?
Well, this is a good town, and these are good people.
And look, friend, we sure would like it
if you'd help us with our problem.
Only problem
you've got, Sheriff,
is a short supply of guts.
You people don't need me.
Look.
Place a couple of good riflemen
on top of that building up there.
Maybe a couple more with shotguns
down behind grain bags over there.
A few more on this roof here.
Lookout up there
in the bell tower.
Maybe a rifleman.
That should just
about take care of it.
Well, what would it take to see that through, you know?
The ambush.
What would it cost us?
Sheriff, I don't know
if I really like
this town that much.
Well,
this is a God-fearing town.
These are God-fearing people.
You like them, you save them.
Look, what if we offered you anything you want?
Anything?
Unlimited credit.
That's what it means.
An open charge account with no reckoning.
What His Honor's trying to say is
you got yourself a free hand in this town, friend.
Any damn thing I want, huh?
Yeah. Go on.
Help yourself.
Help yourself!
Go ahead.
It's my pleasure.
Yes, sir.
Anything you want
that's here,
as best as we can get it for you, we will.
Even if it's some little squaw or a Mex
and keep your bed warm at night.
Hey, you!
Keep your sticky fingers
off them blankets
if you're not buying.
And keep them
kids under control.
Goddamn savages.
And besides, you know, about handling that ambush,
you know, everybody in town,
more or less,
is at your orders.
Here you go.
No, no. No.
Tell him it's all right.
It's all right.
Anything I want?
Now, how's that feel?
Not bad. I'll take them.
All right, that's three pairs
of hand-stitched boots
and a tooled belt with silver buckle.
Let's see, that'll be, five and two, carry the nine,
and that comes to exactly...
No charge.
Come on, now.
I'd like to get all these people a drink.
Yes, sir.
One round for the house.
There you are.
This gentleman here's buying a round for the house.
No fair. No fair.
I ordered one, too. Don't I
get a glass of beer?
You get a glass of beer,
right there.
Coming up.
There we are.
Now, that's one round
for the house, sir.
Anything else?
Get yourself something.
Oh, thank you
very kindly, sir.
I'll have a cigar.
And smoke it later.
Now, including the smoke,
that comes to about $8.50.
There's no charge, Lutie.
Huh?
You was at the meeting.
Anything he wants
in this town, he gets.
You voted on it.
I didn't know that meant free whiskey.
Well, everybody's
got to put something
in the kitty, right?
Right.
About time this town had a new sheriff.
I'm the sheriff?
I'm the sheriff.
I'm sorry, Sam.
But you looked so comical
when he put your badge
on the runt.
I'm not a runt anymore.
I'm the sheriff.
And the mayor.
And I'm the mayor.
Any objections?
No. No, that's fine.
I'm the mayor.
I'm the sheriff.
No more, "Mordecai, bring the water.
"Mordecai, take the laundry.
Clean up the mess."
Hot damn!
I'm gonna declare a holiday.
Hot damn!
Wait a minute.
I can't be a sheriff if I don't have a gun.
Is this about the size gun you're looking for?
No, that one.
That'll do.
Whatever this gent wants, he's to have.
That's orders of Mr. Drake
and Mr. Allen.
I want every man
in the regiment to have
one of these nice rifles.
What regiment?
The City of Lago Volunteers.
Never heard of them.
Why, you ought to, you're in it.
So are you, you, and all of you out there.
I want you all
out in the street
in 10 minutes for drill.
Well, that's that.
Bridges, you Carlin boys,
don't forget your tickets back here to my little hotel.
And don't worry.
They ain't loaded.
What about our horses?
We had three good animals.
What do you think
you've been eating
the last six months?
Damn him! Dog, I didn't
eat my own horse!
That slop he fed us wasn't our horses.
He just stole them and sold them to somebody.
That's what he done!
Shut up.
Well, that's what he done!
Shut up.
When we get to Lago, you can have the mayor's horse.
Fried or barbecued.
Well, I guess we walk some.
Old Drake and Allen don't seem to have remembered.
Oh, they'll remember.
One way or another, they'll remember.
All right.
You don't wanna get shot.
You don't want your shops or your houses burned.
You don't want your women touched.
You don't want anything to happen.
Except you're afraid to do anything about it.
Or you don't know how.
Shit.
MORDECAI: Fire! Fire!
Come on, fire!
I don't remember lending my wagons
to be shot up by these goddamn fools out here.
You know, you're gonna look awfully silly
with that knife sticking up your ass.
MORDECAI: Fire!
Pull those triggers!
Come on, shoot!
Shoot!
Aim! Fire!
You still here?
No. No, I was...
I was just going.
Damn! Can you
do that every time?
Damn right he can.
We're not gonna have a thing in the world to worry about.
This is gonna be a picnic!
All right, keep them after us, huh?
Go on, out there.
You men carpenters?
Sí, señor.
We do rough fixing.
Could you make some tables, big ones,
that a lot of people could sit?
Like for a church picnic?
Exactly.
Well, you could use sawhorses
and one-by-twelves.
Could you have them ready for me by tomorrow morning?
If we have the lumber.
You'll have the lumber.
Come on with me.
You really planning a picnic?
Any objection?
No, just it's the damndest thing I ever heard of.
You haven't heard
the funny part.
What's that?
You're furnishing the beer and whiskey.
Oh, Preacher.
Good morning, Brother Belding.
Mrs. Lake was just
asking about you.
Oh, how is the dear old soul?
Oh, she's chipper as a jaybird.
I don't know how she does it.
Well, she's got
the strength of her faith,
Brother Belding.
Praise God.
The strength of her faith.
Too bad about your barn.
Termites?
There's nothing
wrong with my barn.
It's sound as a dollar.
Then how come those two Mexs is tearing it down?
What?
What do
you greasy bastards think
you're doing to my barn?
STRANGER:
Exactly what I told them.
MORDECAI:
We're requisitioning
your barn, Belding.
Any objection?
You men can go back to work.
Would you mind telling me what the hell's going on here?
And you can help out, too.
You mean, you want me to help you tear down my barn?
Wait a minute.
Maybe he'd be better use
if he'd help us
collect the few little items
we're still missing.
Items? What items? What for?
You got the list, Sheriff.
Read it to him.
We still need 35 bedsheets,
one barbecued steer and 200 gallons of red paint.
Red paint?
We're counting on you for the bedsheets.
Is there anything else?
Yes, there is.
How long is it gonna take you
to get everybody
out of your hotel?
What?
Everybody out.
How long is it gonna take?
Why, I just can't...
I mean, I got eight people
living in rooms up there
in my hotel.
Now, I just...
Where are they gonna go?
Out.
You know better than to walk in a man's camp and...
What the hell is going on?
Well, Stacey, looks like we got three fresh horses.
Wait a while.
He's got him some snappy duds.
MORDECAI: Faster!
Fire! Pull that trigger!
SAM: Go on!
Go on!
MORDECAI: Shoot!
Pull that trigger!
Fire!
Any improvement?
Uh, some.
You know, Lew and I were thinking,
maybe we were a little hasty in our decision.
What do you mean?
Well, maybe we don't
need any outside help
to solve our problem.
Hell, Dave, maybe we don't even have a problem.
Every man who ever got sent up,
went away saying
he's gonna come back
and get even, right?
But think about it.
Can you actually remember anyone ever
coming back and doing anything?
I can't think of one.
Can you?
The point being, you want
to get rid of the gunfighter.
Is that it?
Now, Dave, we got to before it's too late.
He's making a mock of this whole town.
Making that little dwarf the sheriff.
Kicking my own people out of my own hotel.
Got half of the women in town sewing bedsheets together.
They're my bedsheets!
Got those Mexicans down there
building long picnic tables.
Lutie Naylor, down there barbecuing a whole damn steer.
Some kind of a picnic.
Right here in our own town.
Sounds pretty good to me.
What do you mean?
I mean, it sounds like a good idea,
bringing everything out in the open so we can see it.
Don't you see what we're saying?
This whole thing's all for nothing.
They're probably all three blind drunk
in some Nogales whorehouse right now.
Well, if they're
dead drunk in Nogales,
we'll know in 24 hours.
Surely we can put up with the man for one more day.
No. I say no.
He's got this whole town
so people are beginning
to turn on each other.
What's the matter, Morgan?
Anybody special turn on you?
You want to spell that out, Drake?
Spell it yourself.
I'm not gonna jeopardize everything I've built here
because some blond bitch and he threw you out of bed.
God damn you!
Don't talk to me that way.
I'll talk to you any way I like!
I'll say anything I have to say
as long as I'm running this company.
Well, say it, but you could listen
once in a while yourself, you know.
What's the matter, Morgan?
You're not getting your fair share of the profits?
Profits.
It's not the profits.
It's just that this whole business has gone sour
since that deal with that former Marshal Duncan.
Wait a minute, we had
no choice in that matter,
and you know it.
Come on!
Wait a minute...
The big mistake we made
was hiring that man Duncan
in the first place,
and you did that
all by yourself.
All by myself?
Quiet. Shut up.
We can trust one another.
Guys, please...
This whole town had a hand in what happened.
Hell, why do you
think Stacey Bridges
and the Carlin brothers
kept their mouths shut all this time?
Same reason everybody else did in this town.
One hang, we all hang.
Now, you just grit your teeth a little bit longer.
The gunfighter stays
till I say otherwise.
You understand?
Well, there it is, just like he said.
That stranger's got everybody turning on everybody.
Being put out after all these years.
That man!
MORDECAI: Right here.
Okay, folks, put your bags right here in the wagon.
All right, folks, just put your bags
right here in the wagon.
Right here.
What's going on here?
What the hell does it look like is going on, Preacher?
They're emptying my whole hotel.
Throwing out paying guests, right into the street
just to make room for our new guardian angel.
He likes to be by himself, more or less.
You see who's running our town now?
He's sitting right
over there, Mr. Belding.
If you don't like it
why don't
you just go over there
and tell him that he can't?
Mordecai,
someday soon someone's
going to step on your scrawny
little neck, you lizard,
and when they do,
you're going to be nothing
but a squished monster.
See here,
you can't turn all these people out into the night.
It is inhuman, brother.
Inhuman!
I'm not your brother.
We are all brothers in the eyes of God.
All these people, are they your sisters and brothers?
They most certainly are.
Then you won't mind if they come over
and stay at your place, will you?
MORDECAI: All right, folks,
let's go! Put your bags
up here! Let's hurry up!
Friends, friends, don't worry.
We shall find haven for you in our own homes.
And it won't cost you
one cent more than
regular hotel rates.
WOMAN: Paid up,
that's ridiculous.
My room ready?
Two connecting rooms, the best in the hotel.
One for entertaining your many new friends in town,
and one for sleeping.
If your conscience lets you sleep.
Oh, I sleep just fine, ma'am.
Is that so?
You care to see for yourself?
You tell Mrs. Belding
there'll be two for supper.
I like chicken, fried.
And anything else?
Best bottle of wine in town.
Remember, he won't be around forever, you little...
Marshal.
Somebody, please help me.
What are you doing?
Let go of me!
You've got to stop this!
Not now!
Let go of me!
Damn you all to hell.
How did you get in here?
You had your chance and you missed it.
You're hurting me.
What do you want?
Just a little pleasant female company for supper.
You know what you are?
What?
You're an animal.
Yeah, well, you have a way of bringing that out.
No, thank you, but I don't eat with dogs.
You might, if it's the dog that runs the pack.
Give me a half an hour to get ready.
You're ready right now.
I could be readier.
Half an hour.
You know, actually, I eat like a bird.
MORDECAI: I've got it.
I knew that old bastard
Hobart had it in a hole
under the store.
Look. But I've got it.
Yeah, all the way from France.
Yeah, would you stick
a bent knife in that,
get the cork out?
Do you have any special request for dessert?
No, I've already taken care of that.
Can't fix that without
a blacksmith or a vet.
Maybe both.
Hell, we'll find neither one out here.
Well, I'll tell you something, Stace.
I think we've been pushing too hard.
I mean, like as not,
all three of these horses
could have come up lame.
Hell, I feel pretty lame
myself, not being on a horse
Back off, Cole.
Maybe we ought to leave you and the horse here.
Well, now, Stace, I didn't mean nothing.
Hell, Stacey, he can ride
double with me until
we come across somebody.
We'll all need fresh animals.
All right!
Quit crying about it.
I'll tell you what, though.
Soon as they find those bodies back there,
they're gonna have a hunting party out for us.
And I want time to take one year of my life out of Lago
before we move on.
How long is that gonna take, you figure?
A lifetime for some of them.
You're out late, Mordecai.
Huh?
...and fornication
and sins of the flesh.
That's what's going on under my roof
right now while I'm talking to you.
That stranger has taken over my whole hotel,
and thrown good,
honest, decent folk
right out into the night.
Well, why didn't
you stop him, Lewis?
You've got a gun.
You shut your fat mouth, Sam.
We're tired
of giving you money
for doing an incompetent job!
Don't you talk to me that way!
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Please! Look at us!
Sweet God, look what's happening to us.
That's right.
It's just like
the preacher says.
That stranger's got
everybody in this town
at each other's throats.
He's set himself up like a king!
He's got you all
snake fascinated,
every damn one of you!
This crazy picnic.
of blood-red paint.
It couldn't be worse
if the devil himself
had ridden right into Lago.
Welcome to Lago, you son of a bitch.
Get out of here!
They're here, Father!
I'm sorry.
Morg!
Where are you going?
Morg, Morg, take me with you!
Morg? Morg, you better
take me with you.
Morg, where are you going?
Morg! Morg!
Don't leave me here!
He'll kill me!
Get off my cuffs.
Let's go!
LEWIS: Oh, no.
Oh, my beautiful hotel.
They promised me
that they wouldn't...
Ruined.
A total loss.
Didn't even touch my store.
Look, I want you to watch that pilfering.
You know, I hold you responsible, Sheriff.
I'm not
your goddamn sheriff.
You!
Say, I'll need one, two...
Two up there.
I'll need four boxes from you,
and shovels from you, so these people can dig the holes.
Well, yes...
But I thought
perhaps we could...
Right now.
Yeah. All right, everyone.
Was you here?
I mean, did you see anything?
Somebody left the door open,
and the wrong dogs came home.
Yeah. Well...
Get the shovel, will you?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I hope
you're not gonna blame us
for Morgan Allen's stupidity.
Because the rest of us here have an agreement with you.
Well, right now I don't feel too agreeable.
Well, maybe a little bonus
will make you
a little more appreciative.
How little?
Done. Done.
$3,000?
You promised that son of a bitch $3,000
after what he did to my hotel?
Promising's one thing.
Paying's another.
He may just catch a bullet.
Oh, you and Lewis can grab shovels, too.
I knew you were cruel,
but I didn't know
how far you could go.
Well, you still don't.
Well, it doesn't matter to you.
I don't know where
you're gonna sleep now.
Bodies everywhere.
All the rooms are ruined except for our room.
Oh...
Wait. Wait a minute.
Oh, no.
Oh, no. No.
No, let go, let go! Lewis!
Lewis, don't just stand there.
Let go of me!
Let go!
Stop!
Look, you don't need me.
Let go! Let go!
Let go of me!
What are you gonna do with those?
Defend myself.
Against what?
It's no secret what you did to Callie Travers.
Did?
The other day in the stable.
As I recall, she enjoyed that quite a bit.
I promise you, I won't.
Well, you flatter yourself, lady.
I flatter myself?
Yeah, I'd love to oblige you,
but a man's got to get
his rest sometime.
Oblige me?
But I'll tell you what.
If you come back
in about a half-hour,
I'll see what I can do, all right?
Why, you low-down,
stinking, son of a...
Have you ever heard the name Jim Duncan?
I've heard
a lot of things. Why?
He was town marshal here.
He's lying out there in an unmarked grave.
They say the dead
don't rest without a marker
of some kind.
Do you believe that?
What makes you think I care?
I don't know.
He's the reason this town's afraid of strangers.
I was going
to warn you about that.
Pretty funny.
What's funny?
You ask me that
in a blown-up hotel
with seven dead men to your credit already?
I was just stopping by for a bottle of whiskey
and a nice hot bath.
All right.
If you say so.
You don't believe me?
Mister, whatever you say is fine with me.
Be careful.
You're a man
who makes people afraid,
and that's dangerous.
Well, it's what people know about themselves inside
that makes them afraid.
I don't know if we shouldn't mark the grave somehow.
Sam?
I don't see any need.
Ain't likely that anybody's gonna cry over them anyhow.
You know what to do.
Yes, sir, Captain.
All right!
Everybody grab a brush and start in.
You mean, you want the whole place painted?
Everything.
You can't possibly mean the church, too.
I mean especially the church.
All right, I'll paint if you say we've got to,
but when we get done,
this place is
gonna look like hell.
Hello, Lewis.
I want you to go to that
meeting with me, Sarah.
It's very important.
No.
Not now, not ever.
They are still your neighbors!
Yes, they're my neighbors, and they make me sick.
Hiding behind words
like "faith," "peace,"
and "trust."
Good words.
Damn good words.
But we hid a murder behind them.
Won't you never understand, woman?
It wasn't anything we wanted to do.
When Duncan
found out the mine was
on government property,
it was just a technicality, really,
but he was determined to turn us in.
Wouldn't listen to reason.
Is that why?
Is that really
why it happened?
Don't you see, Sarah?
They would have
closed down the mine!
Do you know what would've happened to this town then?
It would've been the end
of everything
that we've worked on.
All of it, all of us!
And you, too, wife.
Now, sometimes we have to do what's necessary to do,
for the good of everybody.
That's the price of progress.
And what's the price of a human life, Lewis?
Ask your good friends if they know that.
Uh-huh.
Your damn conscience.
I'll say,
it's sure taken a hell
of a while to bother you.
I'm packing to leave, Lewis.
I won't be coming back.
COLE: That's Morg Allen,
or what's left of him.
Well, now, what's he doing, riding around here like that?
He's come back to pay us
back for some jail time
that was rightfully his.
Only he don't know it yet.
Stacey, help me.
My arm. Help me.
Help me, Stacey.
I'm curious, Morg.
You helped them railroad us,
and you've got
the balls to come down here
and ask us for a favor?
Goddamn if I don't admire you.
Do something about my arm, Stacey.
Well, I am doing something, Morg.
Sitting here watching you bleed to death.
Stacey, things have changed in Lago.
You need me.
I gotta tell you about it.
Yeah. From the looks
of your arm, Morg,
it looks like
you've run your welcome
out in Lago, and ours, too.
What me and the boys want to know
is how we're gonna pick up 12 months' back pay
and everything else that's owed us.
Stacey, for God's sakes!
No, no. For our sake.
Now you can help us, all right,
and you can help yourself, too.
Now you just give me
the combination
to that big iron box
in the back of your office,
and me and the boys will just
Sneak right in there
real quiet-like,
take what's ours,
bring you the rest,
or leave it there safe and sound, that's up to you.
First, of course, we'll fix up your arm,
set you over there in the shade
with a nice canteen full of water.
You no-good,
worthless son of a bitch.
You're probably right about that.
Give me that combination, Morg.
I wouldn't give you
the combination
to the gates of hell.
Ugh! Dog!
Sure had a lot of blood left in him, didn't he?
Two sticks of dynamite
will take care of that
iron box, anyway.
We don't need him.
Dan, you hit?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
Damn near tore my leg off!
Who the hell is that?
Must be Dave Drake.
What the hell did you hit?
Keep shooting, damn it!
He shot my ear off!
Somebody up there's playing games.
He shot my ear off!
Well, he could've shot
your whole damn head off!
Now get down!
Dave, is that you?
Come on out!
We'll settle this.
Morg was almost dead, anyway, from that arm!
I just put him out of his misery!
I'll kill you!
You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!
Come down out of there,
you bastard!
I'll cut your heart out!
Let's go up there, Stacey.
There might be
some more dynamite.
I'll get him.
I'll get him,
whoever it was up there.
I'll kill every man in Lago!
The guests are on their way to the party,
so gather all the people together.
Right, Captain!
All right, men,
get that sign up!
MORDECAI: Come on!
They're coming!
All right,
everybody, come on!
Get a little move on!
I want you up in that tower.
First sign of dust, you ring the bell, you hear?
Are you sure this is gonna be all right?
It's gonna be all right.
He's back! He's here.
It's time to get ready.
What's the matter
with everybody?
Wait till we gun them down.
Bang, bang, bang!
All right, everybody, I think we're expected outside.
I just hope
that shooter we hired
is feeling up to snuff.
Don't worry.
He'll be fine.
Let's go.
Hey, señor, can we come to the fiesta?
No.
I want everybody to have plenty of those.
Hey, ain't it about time we got out there, huh?
There's plenty of time.
Yeah, but they'll be here any damn minute.
I think Sam's right.
We ought to.
Yeah.
What about after?
What about after we do it?
Hmm?
What do we do then?
Then you live with it.
Where you gonna be?
Are you gonna
take the first shot?
Are you gonna get Stacey Bridges first?
Or maybe you're gonna get all three by yourself?
When are you gonna give the signal?
I'm not. You are.
You old people, move out of here!
MAN: Here they come!
Yee-haw!
Come on!
Fire!
Fire! Fire!
Get them.
Don't shoot me.
Don't! Don't.
A party? A party?
Welcome home party, huh?
Well, here's to your party.
Give me another bottle.
Give me another bottle!
Well, now the party's over.
COLE: Stace!
CALLIE: Let go of me!
Look what I found in the bushes.
Look what I found in the bushes!
Stacey, it was always you.
That's why Morg Allen hated you.
He knew how much I loved you.
Yeah, I bet you just cried yourself to sleep every night
thinking about me in that territorial prison.
But I did. I really did!
Yeah, well, I can see it all now.
You lying there
in Morg Allen's bed,
just a-crying and a-humping.
Oh, no, no!
Give me that bottle.
Cole, go and get the horses ready.
COLE: You got it, Stace.
Stacey.
Stacey, you're gonna take me with you, aren't you?
I can do better than you
in a four-bit fancy house.
You still here?
God damn right I'm still here.
I wanna know
who them sons of bitches
was that ambushed us.
That's what I'd like to know.
That's what we're gonna find out right now.
Who are you?
Don't hit me.
Don't hit me, please!
Please, don't hit me.
Please, stop!
Please, don't hit me!
Please!
Come on, Stacey.
Let's get out of here.
Shut up.
Okay, everybody out.
Everybody out!
Out!
Come on, move!
Go on. Get out!
Move!
Go on.
STACEY: Move!
Hurry up in there. Move!
Move!
Hold up there!
Get in there!
Hold it right there!
MAN 1: Dynamite!
MAN 2: Dynamite!
Stacey, the goddamn horses are gone.
Go on. Go on!
MAN: Help me.
Help me.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm just about done here.
I never did know your name.
Yes, you do.
Take care.
