They had no purpose.
Ikjuist say that, Judge.
Seventy Indians started

Are you sure?
-Yes, of course.
Sir, Indians never fall
without reason.
Moreover surprised 't me

What do you say now?
The train with wage lists
was robbed at St Creek.
The passengers also?
-Yes, but I would send aid.
Toby, this is the man to whom I
had requested.
You know what you should do.
Go to the sherim.
Good stranger,

-Come on, we seize him.
Those bloody red skins too.
Fuck this town.
Get out.
You, murderer.
Murderer, I kill you.
Give me your weapon.
But he was unarmed.
Let him speak.
Day, Tuwan.
Murder by getting your son

He is innocent.
I am for him.
Are you satisfied now?

Ah Johnny, I understand

Why would you see me?
I know where Jeremy Sanders is.
-Jeremy?
That has my brother
not murdered.
That thought the rest, but I do not.
There 's a premium on his head.
A very big.
The government is searching for him all 3jaar.
They see him as the perpetrator.
Jeremy was practically family.
Find him
and go talk to him.
Well. Where is he?
-That will tell ikje now.
There is already 3 years' n hermit
on the Grizzly Mountain.
An Indian tree
has recognized him.
That is our man: Jeremy.
From now on I will win.
I'm broke.
You have a lot of money
of me winning.
This is perhaps sufficient.
Can I see?
-Of course.
Shuffling the cards than you

This should not be found.
There's still mud on.
Yes, those golden eggs
are given fresh today.
Where is the chicken in these eggs?

This is the man I've seen.
How do you know so sure?
He seems not even to Jeremy.
I have seen his face.
He is.
Well. Judge

-The corpse of the Indian is gone.
Wait here.
Come on.
Where the corpse was, is now this stuff
like a kind of card.
Indians who are really mad.
Maki-moteh has his son
fetched.
The funeral will take exactly
three days.
And then?
-Then there will be war.
Unless you are the offender
brings to the chief.
What should I do?
Start at the bison poachers who
IOGEN on the Comanche attack.
But Bob Mac Hara
has been shot dead.
From the front or rear?
-MaaM that?
Help us with this case.
-No, right.
Schneider, more than this.
If something happens, I go to.
lndianen have my mom
and 3 brothers slain.
I've still only Uncle Ben.
-And me.
That is liefvan you,
But you can not even shoot.
I can still learn?
That be_ijfel-I.
You can learn sewing,
Like Webartikelen ...
but to shoot
talent is needed.
However, I can tell, though.
Silence again.
What is it?
No movement.
Goodbye, Judge.
Watch out.
Thank you, young lady.
-You 're welcome.
That is number one bison hunter.
Want to bet?
What is wrong?
I heard a shot.
You're right.
But why he wanted you
murder?
Maybe did my face

And the other?
-Will we arrest him?
For just as it ends like this.

Bring him to the sherim.
Say that I come out.
Folks, go back home

If 't Indian army field
enters ...
is not to prevent a war.
But I must Chen Coma
to watch them in action.
You bet
that they will do so.
I got my orders.
-Toe, captain.
Sometimes it eerzamer
to 'n order not to perform.
What would you do in miin position?
Do you know the Valley of Skeleften?
No. Maybe my tree.

Is it reliable?
One hundred-percent.
Boniah, this man he wants to speak.
Boniah? So called hunters
in Coma Chen.
Are you a Comanche?
-No, a Pueblo.
I've always lived here.

Yes, on the edge of the area
Coma of Chen.
He knows what it is.
-Good, Boniah. You can go.
You go over there and watch.
Whatever you do,
In no case open fire.
If your men stay calm,
this battle is won.
Well, I do what you want.
But if it goes wrong ...
I come before the firing squad.
Please adhere to my friend and she?
Thank you.
You stay here.
I am looking for Toby.
Find him, please.
It is my fault that he is here.
Quietly, I bring him back.

Explain why you agree Caucasian
brothers hate.
It was a trifle.
I cheated at 't play poker ...
and when I had 's army from.
-Maki-moteh snaptje.
The horses are loaded.
If you keep your word, you get
one tenth of Devil head.
It is yours.
Take it.

A nice commodity.
-I hope you 're right.
What do you mean?
-There is still a problem.
Soon is it is not gold.
Listen, I was a lieutenant.
I can read the map.
Four eyes see more than that.
Well, I've Maki-motehs son
Estimated different from 100 meters.
Did you hear that? He is the offender.
-You heard it too.
My words have
much authority among the Indians ...
but in a rechbzaal be
only whites believed.
You can 't post
find?
Sure Hand I say it
where the General is.
Tuwan say that he has slain.
-What are you gonna do?
I'll follow the killer.

Wait a minute.
I have no horse.
Look.
The horse is best for you.
Sure Hand.

There is but one waterpoel
and you fall in it.
Why are you not 't Fort?
-Listen, I've discovered something.
What then?
-The General Tuwan killed.
Can you prove that?
-He seized on there.
Well done.
That should Maki-moteh know.
And the general then?
-That we find later.
I wait for three years,
So three hours there may still be at.
There they are with their new
guns.
What do you know?
-The Squadrons attracts a fight.
They wait for Maki-moteh.
Where are they?
Their goal was

So I got them to the Valley

We must warn them.

-That I am not saying.
We want to see that map.
Where is it gold? Speak.
There, in exactly crucifixion.
-Look out.
Are you crazy?
-No, I did everything in their hands.
That map is now in my head.
There should be nothing over me.
Avoid that I become sick, give
me to eat me and my gun alone.
Your fear that I 's secret
take in my grave ...
is the best life insurance
I can wish.
My dishonor onblag
they may regret.
Wobble Oh, thank God

Not bad.
-Toby.

-No idea.
It is a traitor.
He is now in Maki-moteh.

Otherwise, I do okay.
How are you doing, old man?
I want to go back to my cave.
Since I had to be maintained.
This valley was still your idea?
I said the Valley Skeletons of.
Not the Lost Gil.
Do you have the killer?
-No, but I know where he is.
Say that but against Maki-moteh.

Unfortunately, they surprised us all.
Look.

Good luck.
No, you stay here to

Boniah was useful, but weak.
Sure Hand has acted properly.

and also where he is.
The drums of death remain silent.
My warriors want to fight.
Who is the killer?
-It 's your arms supplier.

-Not true.
I never lie.
You tried to hebtje

Maki-motehs hand trembles.
So I will give the order.
Listen, Chen Coma ...

I am pleased with your arrival.
I am sorry.
Then enter the heart of swab.

That does not.
To err is human.
Chief,
I got a nice idea.
Let your men and loose
flodders shooting.
Then shoot 's army in the air.
-Simple.
