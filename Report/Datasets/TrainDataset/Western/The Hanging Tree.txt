Good day.
Rune has told me
how helpful they were.
Glad
that you are healthy again.
Thank you.
I m צ chte one Minenausr  pation.
Excuse me?
Rune and I
want to go fossicking.
I see.
Fits for the f r  a woman?
- I'm still there.
- I f rchte  hard work is not.
W  you rden me
then a Ausr  pation borrow?
It is very valuable,
one Familienerbst  ck.
The stones are really very rare.
This is an exciting St  ck.
I have a magnifying glass in the apartment.
Do you have any objection
n ה me when I look at her?
Nat  rlich not. Please.
- Doctor, she wants a Minenausr  pation.
- I thought so.
She wants to borrow money then.
This should be an old Erbst  ck.
Do you think
That is more than $ 20 worth?
Tell her that you are her
umen an open credit Einr ה.
All right, Doctor.
If you daf  r underwrite.
Well?
Your Frenchy was not lying!
Give me the money
and it can go to work.
No, first
We discuss the events ה products.
It's embarrassing, with a lady
Done ה  ber fte speak.
- Mr. Plante, we get down to business.
- Substance.
To the point.
What do you think of 20%?
Gro  z  giger as I can be.
I can at any time Ausr  pation
get to 5 or 10%.
Why do you do it then?
No, 20% is too little.
We want 50%.
- The k צ you can accept or ...
- Reject.
Yes, or reject it.
- 50%.
- 50%.
Because you are.
Here's my hand on it.
No, first we go to Mr. Flaunce
and make the contract.
And then we shake hands.
Agreed?
''... erkl ה ren to indemnify,
that if one partner
in the above-referenced Mine
ckziehen from work to  will ... ''
Brrrrrrr!
I catch the groove
up there at the waterfall at
and f  them down hre
behind the tree in the creek.
I'll beat the sh  Geb.
Well, the proud owner of mine?
Sit down there in the shade.
Frenchy does everything alone.
I will participate as you are.
Please consider me as a man
That will not be easy.
A better verbal ה EMPLOYMENT f  r lts
H ה hands will help you cause.
Well, you are 'ne number, you know.
They are really 'ne dolle number.
Go up
and f ה lle wood f  r the gutter.
Rune! Rune!
Go up to the water!
So now we are ready
to wash the sand.
Down with the water!
K צ Now we can begin to dig.
Now we de rei  Earth
the gold from the body,
here
lies hidden for millions of years.
Whoever gets the child?
The wife of Russell.
How I know she wants to 4 dozen
Diapers. Since we prefer to take 12 m.
Tell me, have Flaunce, you
which go from the river above צ rt?
Do you have some nostalgia?
No, I just wanted to know
how's ben since  dr.
- The mine is in operation.
- With Success?
Not likely.
Only 5 ounces to 3 weeks.
That hardly covers the interest.
It takes time.
It has
f  r  about $ 1,000 of goods taken.
- And I will continue to give her credit?
- Yes.
- Even if nothing comes out?
- Even if I lose every penny.
It is indeed nothing to me, Doctor.
When Done ה ftsmann I do not understand
how do you come to Their Costs.
I am not an event ftsmann ה and
therefore accountable to no one.
Thank you
the matter be kept confidential.
Not even my wife wei  them.
I promised Russell
I watch him think.
He was probably more scared than his wife.
M ה Men are funny.
How many M ה male by their wives
the G ה ngelband let f hren .
The k  rzeste  way is via the comb
and then along the river, Doctor.
MINE LUCKY LADY''''
OWNER: E. MAHLER, F. PLANTE, RUNE
In about one months 
we have found almost nothing.
I'm just not  Gl ck.
- We have  m ssen patience.
- Patience is something I have not.
Good day, Doctor. I am pleased
that you can look at times.
I visited a patient.
- M צ you'd like some coffee?
- Yes, please.
Thank you.
Do not tell a doctor weight צ hnlich:
''How are you? ''
And:''You see once your tongue''?
I see how you feel.
Is it me good?
- Show me nde Their H ה.
- They're dirty.
Maybe I should ask
how are you?
Come stop by on occasion.
I'll give you what f  r lts H ה nde.
Thank you, Doctor.
Lucky Lady''''.
Have Eq  ck?
No, but a little bit of hope
can not hurt.
How is Rune?
They are missing two of us.
What do you want?
Spying on us?
What's the matter,
what he can not see?
Well, Rune?
To work, Rune!
Ren you go צ only 50% of this hole.
I will certainly
not more than 50% dirt digging.
Why do not we cut the crap go?
Do it all. But then
צ go mine rune and my rt.
My share k צ nnt have it cheap.
And why  w rde Mr. Plante
so much money vorschie  s,
if he does not believe in the mine?
Why you must  m
Watch a woman like that?
If a partner is not certain rights?
So take a look but does not hurt.
You have to be well doctor
in order to rfen the d .
As you probably nnte k צ
allow even more.
You really are a tough old boot.
But wait a minute.
That's better than nothing.
Rune!
I walk into the village.
I m צ chte that you come with me.
K צ you can stay calm here.
It happens you nothing.
See you tomorrow, Frenchy.
From today I'm going at night
stay down in the village.
I come here just to work.
I have the plague, eh?
The plague.
For a moment,
I'll just change.
Good evening.
Good evening, Mrs. Flaunce.
Our vorr ה te come to an end.
I ask for an advance or
my needle.
Their Unsch ה tzbare needle!
The sack of potatoes is not worth it.
Excuse me, what do you think?
I've seen lhr account register.
The needle
ה h tte I have borrowed a penny.
- What do you want?
- Do not play the innocent.
So you know: Dr. Frail
has advanced to you the money.
K צ us we can well imagine
She told him how to ckzahlen .
I have it in black and white :
$ 1119, you were worth it so far.
Running up like a whore!
L  gnerin. Common wrong queue.
One should trample you.
At some point, somehow
I pay every penny for  ck.
- What you pay for  ck?
- I was in the shop.
Mrs. Flaunce says you made me think.
They even called me a whore.
That was not my intention.
I'm sorry.
- Better to leave the city.
- Do not meddle in my life!
Who gives you the right to
playing with people's lives like that?
Drag the people themselves
and sto s  them out.
- Gef ה it llt you, len people ה qu?
- Not at all.
But you qu ה len us!
Rune just like me.
- Life is political once r ה.
- Maybe it already has.
Then it is true
what one ה erz hlt.
- From the woman who killed herself.
- Yes, that's true.
I was married to this woman.
And the man was my brother.
I have no right to forget.
M צ you'd like me more erz hlen ה?
This is a tincture from plants צ l.
I have you f  r produced.
It will heal Their H ה nde
gardens and at the same time surveilance ה.
I'm at the end! I'm ready!
I can not stand it any longer.
But what we have found
but must come from somewhere!
Somewhere, yes! This is probably

What is it?
The whole earth is moving!
Caution, the tree!
Rune!

- Here I am.
- This is gold!
- What is it?
Gold.
The roots of the tree
have held it.
Where are you?
The freeze is in Tr  mmer gone.
Where are you?
What are you doing in that hole?
Look.
