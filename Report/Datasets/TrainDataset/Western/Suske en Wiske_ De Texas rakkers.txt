All right, men.
This time we'll catch him.
Come on.
Let's go.
Retreat.
They're coming.
Back to the mine. Go!
Retreat.
Come on, guys.
Into the mine.
All right, Ben.
We got them now.
Tomorrow will be
all in the papers.
No, not you Betty.
You have to stand
guard here, ok?
Come on!
Ok.
Finally, we're gonna
find out who is hiding
behind that mask.
He's huge, he's mean
and if he can't cook either
he must be John’s wife.
You think, you're
so funny, ha?
Hey, could someone
turn the light here?
Quiet.
Holy cow.
Parasite is turned to a giant.
-Hello, my friend.
You've shrank and your
problems only began.
Rick, for me?
-No.
Rick, for me?
-I said no.
Stop it already.
Those aren't toys.
For me.
Hand it over.
Don't you worry
about been so tiny.
Soon, you'll be the same size
as everybody else.
You wanna know why?
Because, soon
everyone will be tiny.
Another rose over
there are for me?
LUKE and LUCY
THE TEXAS RANGERS
Don't go, Betty. Where
you go? Come back here. Wait!
Yes. Yes. Come on.
Come on. I got you. Yes.
Yes! Luke the Kid
strikes again.
Luke the Kid?
You mean Luke the clown.
Hey, watch it.
-Not like that.
Hey, leave me alone.
What are you doing?
Oh, now look what
you done. -Who me?
You are terrible player.
Tell me, was that
my fault? No.
Was the Luke the
clown's fault? Yeah. See?
Girls.
Now it's my turn.
Forget it.
I get to go again.
Why don't you both help
me instead of sitting
in front that screen all day?
Luke will help you.
It's my turn to play now.
Why? No way,
it's still my turn.
Hey, Toby. Is
everything all right?
That's a good dog.
I'll go get the door.
-No, I'll go. It's my turn.
No, it's ok, I'll do it.
-That was my...
Good afternoon,
Luke and Lucy.
Theofil Boemerang!
-Theofil Boemerang?
Ambrose speaking.
-Theofil Boemerang!
Theofil Boemerang?
That's right.
Theofil Boemerang.
Sort of kind traveling
salesman.
Everything sell cheap
and not expensive.
Aunt Sybil, fancy
meeting you here.
Do I have deal for you?
You've never seen anything
like this incredible,
unbelievable,
amazing machine.
And if you go ahead and buy
two you only pay for three.
Thank you.
See you again soon.
Yes, I know.
I know.
Manuel, you see
something here?
No. -Here?
-A que? -No.
There should be a bottle here.
A, si. Una botella.
-Yeah, yeah. With Ranger Tom.
Si, si. Ranger Tom.
-It's disappeared.
Vanished.
-Hand it over. -Que?
Give me the bottle.
-I may not a botella.
You mean, you don't
have a bottle? -No.
You mean he escaped?
Si.
Oh, damn to him.
Damn it.
Oh, damn damn. Damn it.
-If the boss finds out...
Oh, damn damn. Damn it.
-Wait, wait, wait.
We move this one
over here. No, no, no.
That one over there.
Others missing there.
Is something wrong?
Well? -No. Nothing.
I was just gonna...
I want to...
-Manuel?
Ranger Tom vanished.
-What?
You, idiots. Go find
him. Immediately!
Let's have that.
-Not for me?
Oh, damn, damn, damn.
Or maybe you can tell me
where your boss is gone, ha?
Go away.
I'm not home.
Oh, Mr. Ambrose,
I took the opportunity
to sweep your
chimney for you.
In black, of course.
Phil Boomerang.
What did Wilbur tell Phil?
Hold down, Wilbur.
I can explain.
-Told you, stay away.
There.
Browse, browse, browse.
I know, but Wilbur understand...
-He sold the aunty yet another
vacuum cleaner and you?
-Me?
Forget about it. It'll
have to be more cutting
before he can sell me
anything. -Yeah, yeah.
Where is Theofil?
Gone to the seaside.
Help!
Ok, Ambrose. So, what
did he sell you this time?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
-Nothing? So what about
that case? -Yeah.
-Well, just that's.
Case with nothing in it.
Do you really mind, ha?
Do you think, it always need
to contain things?
I say no. No, to the tyranny
of minus consumption?
No, to the...
-It's booze. It's whisky.
Come on. Let me
see it. -It's not whisky.
It's... it's... a cough
medicine. -Let me see.
Come on, Lucy.
Let go of it.
Good for my health.
Now look what you did.
Hey.
What is this?
So, have you found the case
with the missing Ranger?
Well, the thing is that
case got shipped to Boston
couple of days ago, boss.
-A, Boston. The Red Socks
ruins the Celtics, The Patriots
bill belly check Tom Brady
and cream pie. -The guy
must be dead, boss.
Dead? Brady? No. No.
No. Brady. Brady.
If someone finds that Ranger,
my plans will be exposed.
I want that case back.
-Get up, Manuel. Come on.
Call Bill.
Oh, Brady no...
He's wearing an
cowboy outfit.
Yeah, he's a Texas Ranger,
like in our game.
I had never seen
anything like it.
This tiny band yet complete.
Well, professor.
Professor?
Oh, yes. Well... This is
obviously human being
of the male persuasion.
Everything is there. Two arms,
two legs. Something just
shrunk him.
Quite a lot.
Sounds like a
thunderstorm coming.
It's Wilbur's stomach.
It's a bit empty.
Go have a look in
the kitchen, Wilbur.
There's a fridge.
Help yourself.
Some people might actually
been thirsty, professor.
Absolutely. Good point,
Ambrose.
Our Ranger is completely
parched. He needs water badly.
What? Oh, yes, yes.
That's exactly
what I meant.
Look at my jacket. That Wilbur
think he's strong, does he?
Hey, you!
What do you
think you're doing?
Boemerang.
-Bill?
Those cases with whiskey
you bought from us yesterday.
Where are they?
I suggest I keep him here
overnight for observation.
Drop or two and
he'll be a lot better.
That's good, professor.
We will be back tomorrow.
Come on, kids. It's
getting really late.
Well, has Wilbur got?
My guess, this store
hasn't finished yet.
Look, Ambrose. You left the
front door open again.
That's impossible.
Stop. We've been
burglarized.
Take a deep breath.
Nobody move.
Thank you. I must have
the investigation.
One foot prints.
The burglar had
at least one leg.
And he can writes.
Uh, you're so smart.
How do you know?
He left the letter
on the wall.
Sorry for the mess,
Ambrose.
I did not find the
case of whiskey,
but if you really want to
enjoy your retirement,
bring the case to the Anchor
bar and come alone.
So, not with two or
more people but alone.
That means not with
the hundred or more
or two hundred or more.
I guess, he means alone.
-My thoughts exactly.
The Anchor is a city's
seller joint in a harbor.
I'll go. I know it well.
-Oh, yeah?
Hm, only by reputation.
Are you Ambrose?
You did come alone, right?
Whiskey or did you bring
your own bottle?
I asked, did you bring
the bottles? -Bottles?
But why the bottles?
To get the money?
They want those bottles
back in Texas, you clown.
Give them to me or else.
-How did that Texas Ranger
get in that bottle?
A Ranger? I haven't
a clue.
Through the bottle neck?
And who shrank
him and why? And how?
And how often?
-Listen Mr. Jeopardy,
did you bring
the bottles or not?
You have enough to drink.
You don't need another bottle.
Is that so? His
memory is failing, guys.
I think,
he'll need a kick.
Oh, no, you don't.
So, are you gonna talk now?
I don't know anything. We work
for Bill Buster of the Seahawk.
He's your mad.
-You see?
Why didn't you say
so right away?
Alright. This drinks for
you but in moderation.
Good night, gentlemen.
Oh, God. It's Ambrose.
Look what you done,
you clown. -Me?
You are the one who wanted to
come here in the first place.
You told me to hit the
first guy they came out.
Did I tell him to
hit Ambrose? No.
Oh, don't start now.
I shouldn't drink any more.
Just one sip of whiskey and
my head hurts.
-Yeah. Ambrose,
your head hurts
because of me.
Did you find anything
out in there?
Yes, Bill Buster of the
Seahawk. He's a man.
The Seahawk. That's a
ship. Come on, Luke.
I'm coming with you.
Hold on. Is that the stick you
hit me over the head with?
Yeah.
Oh, may, then it's
high time I fainted.
Oh, Ambrose.
What we do now?
Taxi.
The Seahawk.
That's it.
How we'll find
Bill Buster here?
Well, just ask around.
Excuse me, do you know
where I can find Bill Buster?
Cabin seven.
-Thank you.
Stupid animal.
Don't wake me for that.
Six.
Oh, it's here.
Shell we knock first
or do we just walk in?
It's not gonna
be that simple.
He's got a gun.
Hold on.
Come on.
There you go.
All right.
Just a little bit further.
You see?
Yeah. Come on.
Come on.
Good evening.
-Freeze. Don't move.
What shouldn't you
be in bed right now?
I'm asking the
questions here.
What do you know
about that Texas Ranger
in the whiskey bottle?
-What Texas Ranger?
What bottle?
Maybe you don't realize
who you dealing with?
This is Luke the Clown.
Luke the Kid.
He's the sharpest
shooter in town.
Get him, Kid.
OK. OK. Easy.
I work for Jim Parasite.
The biggest whiskey
distillery in Texas.
Moonshine whiskey. We sold
some cases to Boemerang
and the boss
wants them back.
And why is that?
Hold on a minute.
Hey, that's my gun.
And that gun's not loaded.
Hey, stop or I'll... shoot.
Stop.
I said stop.
Hey. Did you just knock?
Come on, get inside.
Good night, Bill.
Bill Buster said,
that the bottles came
from  distillery in Texas,
owned by a guy, called
Jim Parasite.
-Jim Parasite? Where is he?
Easy now. Easy.
You are safe here.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Lucy
and this is
my brother Luke.
What happened to you?
I'm Tom
from the Texas's Rangers.
I been shrunk
by Jim Parasite.
Parasite is a crock,
who terrorized a Dark city
with his gang.
The Sheriff
couldn't hold it him, so,
they sent me and my men.
We almost got
them too but...
Parasite got a hold of
some magic powder.
He shrunk me and
all the other Rangers,
but I got away.
Parasite planning terrible
things. I have to go back.
Forget about it.
That's a job to big
for a man so small.
Besides, we need
to find an antidote
do you mind
keep on shrinking.
Someone has to stop him.
Please.
-Aunty?
Go to Texas.
Yeah, that's not small fit.
It could be dangerous.
I don't know such an expedition
is doom to fail
without a real leader.
That's a problem.
You know, leadership
is a rare quality.
You if either got
it or you don't, right?
So, it's important to
choose the right leader
a specially if you...
-Say Ambrose.
Me? Ok, I accept. Thanks
for a lot of confidence.
I'll be the leader of this
expedition as such I say,
I...We... What we
want to do again?
Yes. We're going
to Texas. -Yeah.
Hello. Boss?
I found that Ranger.
Yeah. But there
is a small problem.
What?
Get rid of that Ranger and
the professor immediately.
Nobody will stop me.
I will be the biggest,
the greatest, I tell you.
The greatest. The king.
Please, save me
to that country
where the eagles fly,
where the wolf how
the love some...
Take me where
the rocks are colored red
and my Texas
girlfriends name is
Ginger Red.
O,o, let's go to the
land of Utah, honey.
O,o, let's go to the
land of Utah, honey.
Please take me
where the mountains
are mountain high.
Where time is
on my side.
O,o, let's go to the
land of Utah, honey.
O,o, let's go to the
land of Utah, honey.
Please save me
where the foxes
the rules and debase.
Live together in the harmony.
O,o, let's go to the
land of Utah, honey.
Has anyone see an
Ranger's office yet?
I hope they have
a hair dryer.
And fridge.
I'm hungry.
Are you hungry again?
-Wilbur always hungry.
Right there.
It's over there.
Over there.
Yeah.
I found the composition
of the shrinking powder
in ancient texts.
It's made of the tiny wini
bush, very rare plant.
It's only grows in
American south west.
From the plant's DNA
we take the genes
that keep the bush so small.
Ready?
Why didn't that work?
I was absolutely certain.
These things happen, doc.
Better luck next time.
One, two. One, two.
Test. Test. Test.
You look great in this.
Yes, especially me.
Oh, Ambrose. You look
wonderful.
I always say,
the love is blind.
Come on, Luke. Check out
the neighborhood. -Yeah.
Wilbur and I will visit the
Sheriff office maybe...
Ambrose, watch out!
Gosh, is quite excited.
It's a badge. Must be
the Ranger's horse.
Maybe she's Ranger's
Tom horse?
Oh, poor thing.
Look how sad she looks.
Easy, girl. Don't worry, your
boss is completely  safe with us.
Our professor will do
everything he can
to cure him and then
will come back to you, ok?
Ambrose new girlfriend.
Make good par. Betty
horse, Ambrose donkey.
Hi.
-Hi.
Good day, sir.
Howdy.
-Get inside.
Let's take a look over there.
Good day, sir.
Welcome dear customers
for bargains great and slow,
come to Boemerang.
There's cheap
and not expensive.
Theofil? -No.
Theodore is the name.
Theofil is my cousin
from Boston.
He has been
here a few times.
He's an excellent salesman.
Do you know him?
-Do we ever.
Great. So, what did
you want to buy?
We looking for the
shrinking Rangers.
Shrinking Rangers?
Shrinking Rangers?
We seem to be all
out those right now
but I can order some more.
Now, come on.
We just here to help.
Do you know what
happened to them?
And who is
this Jim Parasite?
Ku-ku, ku-ku.
Gosh, look at the time.
Closing time.
Time to go.
It was very nice to
meeting you. Bye-bye.
But...
What was that all about?
-Who knows.
Hi. -Hello. We are the
new Texas Rangers.
New Rangers?
Why new Rangers, pal?
What's wrong
with the old ones, ha?
Well, they have been shrink
in bottle, do you know?
Get out of here.
Who told you that?
You know, the Rangers
left because was absolutely
nothing to do here.
-Yeah, right. Liar.
No, it's true. Nothing ever
happened in Dark city.
It's a boring town.
And this Parasite who
terrorizes everyone?
Oh, that's just an old tale.
You know, cowboys stories.
So, you don't
need us here?
Of course not.
It's under control.
What is that?
-A party?
Come on.
You don't scare me.
Come on.
Do you hear that?
Someone has to tell them
they have to stop
for playing around like that.
It's dangerous. Come on.
That cowboys are paid
the horse around.
Ok, ok.
Let's start.
I'm a bad girl
that what's they say
just because I sing all
night and sleep all day
I'm a bad girl
but my heart not
made of wood
want some sweet
lovin' daddy come
and make me be good.
He could be strong for me
big and brawny for me
so sweet to me
soft and need for me.
He never go out fishing
he'll be missing Missy's kissin
oh, wild the girl I could be.
I'm just a soul girl
see you lonely in the world
and I'm ready for some papa
to come along and hapa
be my dream
and make a real good
girl out of me.
I'm not a bad girl.
Watch out. You can
swallow a fly.
Hey, guys.
We got visitors.
So, what brings the short barley
and the lady with the big feet,
two shorty’s and a baldy to
our beautiful town?
We're here to restore order.
Mama, help.
First, you will need to prove
you brave enough to be
a real Ranger,
you little pipsqueak.
Showdown. Showdown.
Showdown.
Hey. -Ojla. -I'm not
afraid. Bring it on.
Allow me to interrupt,
but this calls for real hero, Luke.
By the way, if you
have newspaper here
I'm Ambrose with an "S",
as...special.
Lady special needs,
rest is in "as stupid."
Alive rattlesnake
with a deadly bite.
And the rules are, we will
put our hands on the table,
than the snake will be
released. Now, whoever
pulls the hands away
first, is the loser.
Manuel.
Is this really necessary?
Wouldn't you prefer
a nice game of darts?
No? Oh, well let's
do it then. -Senior.
A glass of water.
-It's on a house.
It might be your last.
Be very careful, Ambrose.
Be very careful.
If necessary,
Wilbur eat snake.
Don't make it mad.
Don't make it mad.
The cowboys cheated.
They rubbed your
glass with the potion,
that attract snakes.
Whoever tries to hurt Ambrose,
will have to deal with me.
And with me.
-And with me.
Hey.
Hey, Ambrose.
Oh, yeah.
Saloon fight not for me.
Carry this outside.
Who's next?
Let's go.
Comfortable like this?
-Take this.
A real gentlemen.
-Wilbur?
Come on.
-I'll be back.
Your friend is
very strong, isn't he?
Let's say,
strongest but rough.
Just doesn't have finesse.
You messing with the best.
Asta la vista, baby.
Gracias.
I'm completely
change the formula.
This time will
work for sure.
Just a drop.
Damn it, failed again.
How is that possible?
I think you must move.
But I will get it right.
Don't you worry. Even if it
takes me hundred years.
We are not get it at all.
Seems, nobody knows
about Parasite.
And if they do know
something, they are afraid
to talk to anyone.
After yesterday...
Good morning.
-Good morning.
Is this a bad time?
-Not at all, miss. Come in.
Well, we were discussing the
situation in Dark city.
Maybe you can help miss...
-It's Miss Missy.
Beautiful name.
Well, Miss Missy,
I'm sorry.
We have to apologize
for our behavior.
Wilbur was stupid enough
to wreck the saloon
and now because of him
Miss Missy you're of a job.
That's ok, Ambrose.
The music industry
isn't doing well anyway.
With all that downloading
and all. -Yeah.
As Lucy was saying,
maybe you can
help us out a little.
Maybe you can tell us some
more about Jim Parasite.
Me? But why I would
know more about him?
You are a... bar made.
You hear things in the
saloon. Don't you?
Yes, but it's all busy talk.
And if they talk to me
it's always for the same reason.
I can imagine.
No, I don't think you can.
Come down, aunty.
Well, I thought I could
help but I guess so
just go back to my hotel.
It will be my pleasure
to escort you to your...
hotel miss.
-Wilbur will take Missy.
I think she has a preference
for the more elegant
man on the world.
-I think so too.
Missy not interest it
in bald head it wing backs.
Well, I least I don't look
like Shrek's ugly brother.
No. Ambrose
don't this ugly brother.
Maybe let Missy decide, hm?
Well, we will ask
her right away then.
Well, this really separates
the men from the boys.
Thanks for walking me
back to my room, Luke.
That was very sweet.
What's with you guys?
I think, aunty is
on the something.
That means Missy could
be Parasite accomplice.
Oh, come on, Lucy.
With eyes like that?
Snap out of it, man.
Yeah and talking
about being suspicious.
What about that Sheriff?
He's real weirdo.
Hides in his office all day
refusing to make a stand.
No, how can he be?
His legs in the cast.
Hey, you think, Theodor has
any dealing with Parasite?
I'm so. I bet he already sold a
couple of vacuum cleaners.
Yeah, dirt cheap
and not expensive.
Oh, Luke.
There is something
weird is going on.
Last warning.
You leaving Dark city
today. All of you.
J.P.
-Jim Parasite.
That was Parasite.
Aunty.
-Children. Are you all right?
Who was that shooting?
I'll show them.
He was Parasite. He
wants us to leave town.
Oh, really?
What a shame. Well,
you know,
we're not welcome here. Maybe
it's just better if we get out.
We are not letting him chase
us away, are we aunty?
No. We have to make
that bully understand
we're not afraid.
We had to be careful.
Ambrose. Wilbur.
You two will comb the town.
Comb the town,
you say?
Talk the words right
out of my mouth.
Street presents.
Shown the town,
that everything
is under control.
I think,
we should split out.
Yes, good plan.
We split up.
I go left side of town.
-Ok. And... and I go the right.
Ambrose can choose.
Aunty, we'll go
tell the Sheriff
and let him know,
that we saw Jim Parasite.
Ok. But remember,
be very careful.
Yeah, come on in.
Is he gone?
-Who?
Who? Who do you
think? Santa Claus.
Parasite, of course. -How
did you know was him?
It must of be him.
It's always him.
Hey, what kind
of Sheriff are you?
You heard him shooting
yet you do nothing?
Listen, little lady.
My legs on the cast.
I can't do anything.
And besides, I...
Who I'm kidding?
Even without a broken leg,
I couldn't do a thing.
Nobody can touch Parasite.
It's too powerful and
way too dangerous.
Friends, trust me.
Get out of here
before will something
terrible happens.
I'm serious.
What are you doing here?
I'm a... combing town.
Oh, right. But I combed
everything here already.
Why don't you go
comb somewhere else?
Better if Wilbur double comb.
Well, do you comb
this part of town?
Well...I...I... I thought you
deserve some pretty flowers.
Get in here, you dove.
I don't trust that Miss Missy
not one little bit
and I discovered
something big.
Me too.
Not that, you ninny.
More like this.
What are you doing here?
Came to bring flowers.
-Yap, me too.
And I want to ask
you some questions.
Where were you
the past half hour?
I was taking a bath, ok?
And now I would like all of
you to get out of my room.
Right now!
Already go.
Must forgive friends.
Friends no manners.
Missy Stuart.
Wilbur help drive off.
Leave me alone.
All of you.
There. You hear?
Missy want to be alone.
That was heavy. I almost
fell sorry for poor guy.
I don't know. Why
is he Sheriff then?
He didn't even have a clue
who Parasite might even be.
I think it's someone
from the town.
What else he would
hide behind the mask.
Yeah, you right. Ok.
So, who in this town
resembles Jim Parasite?
Good morning, children.
Something tells me you
two needs new hats.
How would you know?
Because yours are already
fill with bullet holes.
Come on in.
Beautiful design, isn't it?
A hat to tip your head, I say.
Dirt cheap
and not expensive.
What do you think?
Well, it's a hat.
Hey, there's something
I would like to know.
How they clean those hats?
It's very simple.
With this multi
functional vacuum cleaner,
which comes with it
special head attach.
Wait. That's what we need.
No way. When it's
too easy is not fun.
Theodore, I need some
cases of that whiskey.
Excellent choice.
Superb whiskey.
I been for my own barley.
Great. I'll take
ten cases.
Need tonight. We're
gonna have a party...
for Ambrose's birthday.
Today is not Ambrose's...
Ten cases of whiskey. Ten.
Go to see my supplier.
I'll be back in one hour.
Bye-bye.
Ten cases. -So, since when
do you buy whiskey?
Didn't you notice?
They were the same exact
cases as Ambrose's.
Yeah. -Then you understand
why ordered more
than he had in stock.
Because then he
needs to get more
and does he get them from?
From Parasite.
-That's right. -Of, course.
Yeah, yeah. You're
smart. Everybody knows.
Ten cases.
Hello!
Is anybody home?
Is anybody here?
Stop.
-A, there is. Good.
I was getting scared.
Boss.
There's a problem.
One thing is for sure.
Theodor is not Parasite.
Quiet, I wanna hear
what Parasite says.
Lucy.
-Be quiet.
Lucy.
-What?
Hojla.
I hope you have a very good
reason for coming here.
I'm just here to buy whiskey.
A lots of whiskey.
Will do good business, a?
Come on.
Andale. Arriva.
Is that a new gun?
-Yes. Brand new.
Nice. And are
you happy with it?
Si, si. Very happy.
It looks very cool.
Can I hold it?
-No.
Here.
-For me?
Only if I can...
-Ok.
Oh, for me.
Ole.
No. No. No. No. No.
Stupido. Stupido.
Stupido.
And who is so thirsty
that you have to come here,
what you not supposed to be?
You will be really surprised.
The Rangers.
-What?
The Rangers? You full.
You brought the Rangers here?
They'll need a very
big vacuum cleaner
to clean up what's left
of you when I'm done.
Help. What a coincidence.
All right, just happen to
have some in stock.
Go. Go. Go. Go.
Go after them.
Is still hanging on?
Yes he is but
we're not alone.
Slow down.
Not so fast.
Aunty, help.
-Lucy?
Aunty, help us. We been
pursued by Parasite's gang.
Ambrose. Wilbur.
Lucy, hold on.
They're on their way.
Come on, Theodor.
-I'll do it. I'll do it.
One, two, three.
Lucy, give me your hand.
My little van.
Hey, what is this means?
Look out.
Oh, no. The bridge.
We're too late.
Wilbur take care of it.
I coming too.
Oh, Luke. Please tell me
you can stop the train.
I can stop the train.
-Really? -No.
I think that's
a steam whistle.
There's only one
thing left we can do.
Oh, it's Wilbur.
-Wilbur. -My hero.
Thanks a lot, Wilbur.
-It's all right.
Otherwise Wilbur blush.
I got it on the control.
They want more?
That it's what will they get.
So, were doing
business with Parasite.
How could you? -I'm just
a small time shop owner,
who ester on a living.
-What business is slow
when a customer is a
customer. -Aunt Cybil,
I knew you not understand.
-That's nonsense.
You knew that
Parasite was a bandit
and yet you did nothing
to help the Rangers.
We have to go
back to the mine.
I believed that Rangers has
been held hostage there.
By now Parasite
has long gone
or hide in one of
the many tunnels.
Then we will look for
him there. -No, no. no.
There are no
road signs, you know.
Miles and miles of tunnels
full of holes and traps...
This is Ambrose, but you
can call me Mr. Ambrose.
This is Jim Parasite.
Jim Parasite? What a
coincidence that you call.
We just talking about
you. How are you?
How is the family?
It's Jim Parasite.
Hands up! Don't
move a muscle.
You imbecile. I wanna
talk with your leader.
I've a proposition.
-Really? A? Yes.
Well, that's me.
Yes.
-What yes, yes?
Really? Where?
And when?
Excellent. Yes, of
course. I'll be there. Ok.
See you later.
Bye Jim.
Voila. Well,
that's taken care of.
What's taken care of? -Well, that
J.P. certainly isn't stupid.
I mean, he is able to
recognize a real leader.
Hold me back or I'll wrap
the real leader's neck.
What's taken care of?
Well, J.P. actually
challenge me to a duel
to finally set all this
business once and for all
and of course,
I accept it.
Have you lost your
mind, Ambrose?
Lost my mind? I'll just teach
that pretender who is boss
and case closed.
-But Ambrose, don't you know
Parasite is a crack shot?
-And I'm not?
Do you see Wilbur's
hat hanging there?
Yeah. That was off by a mile.
I...Yes well,
that's because a...
I notice just in time,
there was my hat.
Look.
Will you shut him,
you idiots.
Got you.
For me.
No. -Come on.
-For me. For me. For me.
Strike.
And it's nonstick.
Don't run away now.
-No, no. no. no. -OK.
It's Missy's room.
Surprise.
Where's Wilbur?
Wasn't he with you?
No. I haven't seen him.
And where is Parasite?
That coward. -Come. Let’s puts
these stags behind bars first.
And where was that Sheriff?
Sheriff?
What happened?
I was... you know...just get
ready to come  watch duel.
I mean, come help you...
and all of sudden Parasite
was here and lock
me in the cell.
Well, the good news is
we round up the Parasite's
entire gang.
-The whole gang?
Well, we haven't got
a Parasite himself yet,
but that's just a matter of time.
-And the meantime,
here are the others.
If you could just guard them,
when we'll finish our job?
We would be really grateful.
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
Of course. You can count on me.
I'm your man.
-Hey, Sheriff.
Now, please listen
to me carefully.
Do not let them go.
We haven't got a
clue who might be.
The Sheriff didn't do in,
the Theodor didn't do in...
Is not me either or I would
arrested myself a long time ago.
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.
Jim Parasite is captured
your friend Wilbur.
Leave Dark city
before sundown or
you never see your
friend Wilbur again.
Jim Parasite.
-Impossible.
How could Parasite
possibly bit our guy?
No way. -Yeah.
-I'm afraid it's true.
If that monster even
durst only a finger on Wilbur I...
What we gonna do now?
We can't just leave, can we?
I know it's hard to leave but you
can't put Wilbur's life on a line.
I don't want to admit it
but Missy is right.
But aunty...
-There's no other way.
We have to leave.
-Wilbur.
Don't tell me
you're leaving.
Are you serious? I hate this
is loyal customers leave.
Say this isn't true. What's
the point of all?
Theodore, it is something
you can do for us.
Really?
I...well...I have a secrium.
I'll sent Wilbur home,
when I'll catch Parasite.
That's very unsure,
Sheriff.
I'm so sorry, Ambrose.
But I promise I'll do
anything in my power
to find your friend.
The law doesn't seem to
be that tough after all.
Wait to friends
get here. -Friends?
You don't have any,
little man.
Luke and Lucy are leaving,
leaving you here to rot.
Liar. They wouldn't leave
without Wilbur. -No?
Watch carefully, little man.
It's show time.
But is shame.
They're gone.
I can't believe it.
-Looser. Nobody.
They leave you here to rot.
It's so typical.
I would never
know any different,
even as a child.
But then I swore.
Nobody will humiliate
me anymore.
Soon, boom!
And then, I will be the
greatest king of the world.
King craziest.
Theodore, oh, boy. What
got yourself into to now?
Stay calm. Stay calm.
Deep breaths. Our father
in the lighting heaven
I will be done.
Save us from taxes
and while your addit
for competition as well.
Why not?
Listen, doc. I don't
wanna press on you,
but I really hope this
will work this time.
This time I'll add a
bit of Flesh Extra.
What Flesh Extra?
Flesh Extra is a
laundry detergent
but not just any
laundry detergent.
NASA developed to me
the astronauts laundry
shruf proof. I made the
anti-shrinking powder
one hundred times
stronger. It should be
story to your previous
dimension if not more.
Whatever, doc.
Just pour it.
Ready?
All right, doc.
You did it, man.
Great.
I don't know
how to thank you.
Oh, well, it was
a piece of cake.
Ok, guys.
The coast is clear.
A fantastic plan,
children.
Did he really think
we run off?
It's time for faced to Jim.
Cut it out, Betty.
Come on,
get off from me.
Be quiet, girl.
Miss...
What's wrong with you?
-Well, Mr. smooth Casanova,
did you ever think to
wonder where she might
be going this late at night?
Ok, ok, ok.
Doc, let's go.
It's time to go.
You poor thing, you must
be boil out of your hands.
It's time for some
action. Come on.
Parasite break out his  gang.
That's not surprise.
Our brave Sheriff
probably just run off.
Careful.
How strange.
She can't fly, can't she?
A secret passage.
-Well done, Ambrose.
Always use your head, I say.
Over there.
There she goes.
Let's fallow her.
-No, wait.
I'm the leader.
I make the decisions
and I say: "We fallow her."
And: "Action".
Hey.
Come on, Luke
or we'll lose her.
Hey. Hey.
You guys, come on.
Wait for me.
Missy. -What?
What are you doing here?
You're asking us?
How about you?
Hands up, you snake.
-But I ...
I knew you're along
the whole time.
You are lucky Wilbur
is unharmed,
a bit smaller but anyway,
otherwise I would give you...
Cybil.
...you traitor.
Cybil.
-What? -Look.
Fools. You losers.
Welcome to my kingdom.
For me.
The party is over.
Is now time to meet the
brains behind this operation.
And there is...
No. -I knew it.
Oh, yeah? You
don't know anything.
Tell me, how I could
be locked in the jail
and in the tool
the same time, ha?
And get beaten by Ambrose.
Hey, it's simple. There's a
secret trap door in your cell.
You were never locked up
in the first place.
While we are around it up
your gang after the duel,
you locked just self in,
you put on your cast
and then you waited for us.
How silly of us.
-And cleaver of me.
You did good, kid. Eight
plus, but you're too late.
This ball contains enough
shrinking powder
to shrink you to
into tiny tiny people.
But you are lucky.
In a minute, you will have
the privilege to
been in a front roll
to witness to lunch at the
biggest operation mankind
has ever under take in.
Operation, mini man.
This rocket is about to
be lunch into space
armed with millions of
balls of shrinking powder
that will spread it a
chain reaction across
all cokmits of the planet
and will make everybody
on Earth tiny tiny people.
And only I will still be big.
Yes, me. Me, me, me, me.
Oh, yes. And then I'll meet
only one more thing
and that is...
-A good shrink? -No.
The only thing I
ever need is a...
No!
I'm small. I'm small.
I'm small.
Get them. I said,
get them.
Now, stand behind me,
ladies. This will hurt.
Well, does it hurt?
-No, no.
Got to the key.
Excuse me, Missy.
Who  are you really?
You want to know
who I am?
Undercover FBI agent
on the special mission.
Yes, that was also possibility.
Wilbur.
Stop them, you idiots.
No, no, no.
Por qué?
Come on, Manuel. Pull
yourself together. Here.
No, that's ok.
You can keep it.
Yeah, no gracias.
-I said it's ok. Keep it.
It's for you.
-Not for me.
Not for me.
That's huge.
Look over there.
Come on.
Let's get him.
Oh, no. The
children go in there.
Come on.
Come on. Move on tight.
-Are you sure?
Yeah.
-Let's go.
Hurry up, Luke.
Get back here!
Help! Let us out.
The code.
What's the code.
Who wants a little kiss?
-Wilbur.
Kiss later. -The first who
will give me the code
gets a really big kiss.
-King! -King! -King! -King!
Hi, everyone.
You have to get out.
It's gonna blow.
I'm a king.
The greatest.
Oh, no. We are too late.
Theofil?
-It's Theodor.
Theodor,
what happened?
Where are Luke and Lucy?
-I don't know.
They went to search
the mine and
and then was this explosion.
Toby?
-What is going on?
Look, it's Toby.
For me? -No,
don't give me to him.
No, no, no, no.
I'm the king.
I'm the king, I tell you.
No, no, no.
Let me out.
Let me out, please.
Because of yours
heroic actions
Dark city is saved.
And in the name
of the governor
I point you,
honorary Texas
Rangers for life.
Lucy and Luke.
Thank you.
Job well done.
Yes.
-Yeah.
Thank you so much,
professor.
If it wasn't for you,
we'll be tiny forever.
It was absolutely
my pleasure, miss.
And you're very
charming indeed.
I wouldn't was ever size.
Problems, brose?
-Well... I just thought
my horse Betty would
come say goodbye.
Probably, you're not
her type after all.
Watch your mouth.
Hey, Missy.
-Missy.
Hi, guys. I'll miss both
of you very much.
Miss you too.
What if I ask you...
-Yes, be honest with us.
Which one of us do you
fancy the most?
Tom here is my fiancé.
We will be getting
married soon. -Yeah.
That's right, guys.
-That's fantastic.
That is such a great
news to hear.
I'm so very happy,
for you both, I mean.
Great news, isn't it?
Isn't it fantastic?
Yeah, yeah.
Fantastic, I know.
Goodbye.
All right. Bye.
Goodbye.
Cybil, you didn't buy another
vacuum cleaner, did you?
Better shouldn’t say too much.
What's in that case?
-What case? Oh, that case?
Cough medicine.
Cough medicine, yeah.
That's it.
Hey, guys.
Look, who is here.
Oh, Betty. Sweet Betty.
