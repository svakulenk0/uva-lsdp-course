Father!
Father!
To sleep... to die...
No, to sleep!
Perchance to dream!
There's the rub!
To be, or not to be:
That is the question...
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer...
The slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune...
Or to take arms against
a sea of troubles...
And by opposing end them?
To die, to sleep...
No more!
And by a sleep...
- And by a sleep to say we end...
- Father...
- Father...
- That's strange...
The ones returning
from war...
...usually have the names
of women on their lips.
This one's got nothing better on
his mind than calling for his father.
Right. And who knows
if he even has a father.
I mean a real father.
Who fosters and protects you,
who gives you a home.
I don't think he has
a father like that.
Otherwise, he wouldn't be sleeping
under the wagon of some performers.
Ah, war only harms.
And you? Have you learned
this damned role already?
I'm rehearsing it
right now!
Listen, if you blow your lines
tonight I'll cut your meals!
Hey!
Soldier.
Wake up.
You've been sleeping
since last evening.
Where are you from?
Who are you?
Don't you want
to tell me?
A secret...
You're strange.
For who would bear the whips
and scorns of time.
The oppressor's wrong,
the proud man's contumely...
The pangs of
despised love...
The pangs of
despised love!
For who would bear the whips
and scorns of time...
Why did he shoot?
I don't get it...
Who are they?
That's Butch Warren, isn't it?
- And what did he want from us?
- Those rogues hardly rode that far...
...just to rob
some poor performers.
Thank God, that soldier
is a good shot!
- Thanks a lot, anyway...
- Look, he's leaving!
Now what?
You're running off?
Hey hero!
JOHNNY HAMLET
Hey.
There... The dream
didn't fool me.
"Willfully murdered".
But who did it?
Who?
Maybe someone
he hated.
Relative of yours?
My father.
All the tears on earth aren't enough
to cry for a man like you.
And me?
Why wasn't I here?
Where was I when
they killed you?
So far away from my home,
from my land... for such a long time.
Defending a flag, a piece
of honorable cloth.
Instead of protecting my father,
my own flesh, my own blood!
Did he call my name
in that very moment?
Like in that dream?
A good man, Hamilton.
A man of honor.
Hey!
Watch out, gravedigger!
If you soil my shoes, I'll make you
clean them with your tongue.
And try not to make
any noise when you dig!
Can't you see, you're disturbing the
pious souls who come here to pray?
Am I right, Ross?
Hey General!
What are you doing here?
Are you looking for a grave?
Huh? Yours?
I have to warn you, my friend
doesn't like uniforms that much.
Am I right, Guild?
Even worse! An uniform like
this one could make me angry...
...like the
red rag to a bull.
Olé, toro!
Hey Guild.
What do you think
about those heros...
...who instead of dying
on the battlefield...
...end up on the cemetery,
draped with medals?
Huh?
Hey you, gravedigger!
Come on, let's go!
Dig a grave...
for this heroic general!
I'll take care...
of the corpse.
Hey! What should we
engrave on the tombstone?
You've laughed three
times already, my friend.
The next laugher
could be your last.
Don't you see that
I'm trembling with fear?
Damn it, I've never
seen you shaking like this!
Get lost, you two!
I don't like talking to someone
who shoots from behind.
You're right, Ross.
My father used to say...
...amateurs never confront
you with the muzzle.
Then get lost quick before I...
get to the professional part.
Very good, yes. Make a nice face.
Hey, no! Not on the grip...
It's more hygienic
on the barrel.
Exactly!
Very good...
Hey you!
Get out!
Can't you see that
they're two good boys?
Too bad...
That was a wine that
could have awoken the dead.
That's what they say.
Until next time,
my friend.
- We'll see each other again.
- Whenever you like.
Thanks, Horaz.
You're welcome, Johnny.
You always show up
in the right moment.
Like back then,
when I was a little boy.
You've become
a man, Johnny.
And you seem
to be alright.
It was about time
for you to come back.
I need your help.
I want to know
who killed my father.
- And you have to tell me.
- I don't know.
I was told,
it was Santana.
That's what they said.
But I...
...I don't know.
They also said your
uncle avenged him.
Santana lies over there.
I wouldn't have even wasted
a grave for a bandit like him.
And my mother?
She suffered.
She's still
on the ranch.
Gertie!
Are you over there?
What are you doing?
I'm there in a minute.
Satisfied with the party?
Ah, good.
You're an outstanding landlady.
What?
No, fool!
Come here!
I command you to!
The wife has to obey the husband!
And if she doesn't listen...
...the husband beats her up!
- No! I obey! I obey!
Oh sweetheart...
Who's there?
Johnny!
Johnny!
Oh Johnny...
Two years...
Two years of
that horrible war.
Why did you
marry my uncle?
Do you know what
happened to your father?
When they killed him,
I felt like I had to die of pain.
A short pain.
You didn't let
his bed cool down!
You mustn't talk
to me like this!
That's true.
You're the landlady here.
You're the wife of your
husband's brother.
And you're still...
my mother.
Yes... your mother.
But Johnny, you're
not a little boy anymore.
And I'm a woman.
And so alone.
If your uncle
hadn't been there...
...they would have taken everything away.
Do you understand? Everything!
Sure, sure.
So... uncle Claude
saved everything.
And in exchange,
took everything for himself.
Yes...
- Also the caresses of my mother!
- Johnny!
You're embittered
of pain.
Why don't you want
to understand me?
Your mother is right.
Johnny!
Welcome home.
Johnny!
Hello, Johnny!
For how long have I
been waiting for you?
Too long.
Don't talk now.
Emily...
What are you doing?
Emily!
You shouldn't
have left, Johnny.
You shouldn't
have left me.
But now...
Now I'm here.
And everything will be
the way it used to be.
A lot has happened.
Lots of bad things.
And nothing could be
the way it was.
What do you know?
What can you tell me
about my father?
Don't ask me, Johnny.
I'm begging you.
I don't want to talk about it.
And it's also better for you.
But I have to.
Did you tell your
father that I'm back?
No, Johnny!
I'm also not the same person
I was back then anymore.
- That's enough!
- Johnny!
- Tell me what happened!
- No!
I want to know what
they have done to you!
- Johnny, go!
- Come on, talk!
Tell me who
killed my father!
- Save yourself, Johnny! Go away!
- What do you know? What did you see?
- No, I don't know anything.
- Talk!
I don't know
anything, Johnny!
- Talk!
- Hey General!
Is that the way you treat
the sheriff's daughter?
Her father's
the sheriff now.
And you're asking that girl
too many questions.
How can you demand
that she answers you?
- If she can't answer...
- Go, Johnny.
...somebody else will
answer my questions.
- Is that so?
- Go!
But that wouldn't
be good for you.
Did you see, my lovely?
You've been warned.
These are dangerous acquaintances.
Even for the daughter of the sheriff.
Want some help?
Whoops!
Get up!
Olé!
That's for you!
Come on!
Let's go!
Stop it!
Get lost, you two!
It went well for today.
- Until next time.
- And watch out...
- Next time will be the last time!
- If it's the last time...
...I'd hate to miss it.
Let me know where.
So this must be
the keeper of order.
But he rather calls out
for order than keeping it.
Don't provoke me!
And keep in mind:
I'm representing the law around here.
Well... and the criminals
elected you sheriff.
I don't think there's
someone else in this world...
...who started out
as low as you did...
...and succeeded
in going even lower.
Fine, you'll pay
for that, too.
And when it comes to you, Johnny,
my daughter's already told you...
...that she doesn't want you
around her anymore.
Go away from here,
before it's too late.
- My return seems to bother everybody.
- Well...
Listen...
This might interest you.
I kept it for you.
It lay next to
your father's corpse.
Someone said it's the
signature of his murderer.
Of Santana?
If it belongs to him -
it belongs to him.
Horaz...
I must know...
Must know why Santana
killed my father!
If Santana really did it.
Six times the bull's eye.
You're relying too much
on your skills.
Now your gun is... empty.
And you, Johnny...
...rely too much
on the appearance.
There could always be someone
who's been making precautions.
And it's...
the last shot that counts.
When you expect it
the least...
...you meet someone
who's quicker and smarter.
My father...
must have met someone like that.
Don't you think?
But I doubt that Santana
was quicker than my father.
Even more so:
I refuse to believe it.
And what are you trying
to say by that?
Someone like Santana doesn't
act without an intention.
What reason did he have
to kill my father?
Listen...
This is a very dirty story.
And I wouldn't want to be
the one to tell you.
I want to know.
The war had also
changed your father.
- Come on, keep talking.
- As you wish.
When the south
was about to lose...
...the townsfolk
here in Texas...
...collected a contribution
of 300,000 dollars.
Only your father knew the
transportation route. But instead...
...Santana attacked
the convoy.
Don't you think
that's strange?
Don't stop.
He killed the escort,
but he didn't find any gold.
And then he went
to your father.
Don't spit on his grave!
These are facts.
I don't want to know what kind
of relationship these two had.
But as I heard that Santana
killed your father -
...don't forget that
he was my brother -
...I avenged him!
Santana was a bandit.
And I butchered him
like a dog.
Everybody in this colony who has
a feeling for honor and justice...
...agreed with me.
And what happened
to the 300,000 dollars?
Everbody who knew
is dead.
Santana.
My father.
But this gold is missing.
Well... Whoever did that job,
did a good one.
After all, Horaz, the world's
a less awful place...
...if you look at it
through a glass.
And that's one more reason
for always keeping it full.
Cheers.
My father...
He always lived
a righteous life...
...to finish it with
a disgraceful death.
Nobody chooses...
his death.
The life...
that's what you have to choose.
And it's a difficult choice.
- Landing! We're there!
- Are we stopping here?
Finally!
We'll stay in a guesthouse
for a night!
Unload everything and make sure
that you don't beat a drum!
Et voila.
Who are you?
You're dead.
A no-good,
that's what you are!
Couldn't you have dug out
your witty jokes...
...on stage in Denver?
They wouldn't have kicked
us out of the theater then.
- I already sent you packing twice!
- I only do pantomime!
Just get lost with the amateur
who always blows his lines...
...on "to be or not to be"!
- And Ophelia?
She always goes with everybody.
Only in Denver...
...she had to play the
picky one with that judge!
The boos were directed
at her, not on me!
Also on you, windbag,
also on you!
I go to bed alone.
Hey soldier! Who had ever
imagined to meet you here?
Have you gone mad?
You've hurt me!
- Who gave that to you?
- Why? Are you jealous?
- I want to know where you got it from.
- Ah, I don't know. About a month ago.
From a Mexican with a dark voice.
A really handsome man.
- The name!
- I can't remember.
He had a big belt full
of those tiny things.
And then I
ripped some off.
- And if it doesn't go well?
- Come on, what are you afraid of?
Someone who's been buried for
two years doesn't walk around...
...and gives earrings
to actresses.
- Did you hear me, gravedigger?
- But I don't account for it.
If the girl told the truth,
then this grave is empty.
- Empty?
- Come on, dig!
For 100 dollars I'll dig
as far as hell!
and 100 to bring them back.
- We're there.
- Open up.
Stinks even worse than
the other killers' corpses.
Right, Mister?
It's a damn shame, letting
this here rot next to the worms.
That thing is
worth something!
Bury him again.
Johnny.
What are you doing here?
Are you ransacking
the graves?
Why are you watching me?
It appears to me that
you're beginning to overdo it.
You're acting like a jackal.
You're snooping around everywhere
just like a dirty, hungry dog...
...and you insult everyone
with your suspicions.
What the hell
are you looking for?
I wanted to look in the face
of my father's murderer.
In the face!
Do you understand?
In the face!
Johnny!
I did what I could
for your father.
And I couldn't save him.
But if you still
don't believe me...
Shoot!
Don't you think your
mother suffered enough?
Hey Guild.
Look, who's coming.
Jump, donkey! Jump!
Well, was it
of use for you?
Have you been in the cemetery?
What was in the coffin?
Santana.
Nevertheless, I don't believe that two
different Mexicans are running around here...
...collecting and giving
away the same little things.
So then, who's buried there?
Not the murderer of my father.
But he will end up there, too.
Whoever that is.
Hey...
Are you running around
with an empty gun?
I'm loading late...
...but I'm shooting first.
Hey, wake up!
Oh, look...
But these weren't the ones
that belonged to the actress.
They killed her, Horaz.
Obviously, the one who had her
disposed didn't want her to talk.
One witness less.
But he confirmed the suspicion.
And he also made
an even bigger mistake.
He didn't manage
to knock me off.
He tried -
and he'll do it again.
Nobody is perfect
in this world.
You wanted this one?
Yes, his!
Thanks.
Johnny, you must
remember...
...that it once belonged
to a good man.
I know.
Your father only used it
to defend himself.
And to protect us
and our land.
I hope that
you'll do the same.
Johnny, will you
come back?
Will you
promise me that?
Maybe.
I don't know.
Stop!
Pedro!
What are you
looking for, amigo?
- Santana.
- Santana?
Are you chasing
phantoms, hombre?
- Santana is dead.
- No! I don't believe so.
What is it that
you don't believe?
Freeze!
And now you'll accompany
me to the phantom.
There it is.
- Usually he's there, in this house.
- Ah, fine.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Santana!
Now I had enough
of these games, boy.
I just let you fool
around with my men...
...because it was
fun for me.
Hey hombre!
- Easy, man!
- Stay calm, Santana.
The young ones are
always impulsive.
You shouldn't lose your head
that easily, understand?
Understand what?
That you robbed
everything?
The life of my father,
the love of my mother, our land!
Sometimes, pain and anger
are very bad advisers.
I've already told you
that the war changed everything.
Johnny...
You have to accept these,
henceforth, final events.
The death
of your father...
...my marriage...
...and my adherence
to this land.
You're blaming me
for this, right?
Come on, Johnny, just listen to me.
Try to curb your antipathy.
Life goes on.
Why shouldn't the two
of us become friends?
Don't touch me!
It doesn't help you
to play this dirty comedy.
There's still one thing
I need to know about you.
And it's something that
doesn't interest only me...
- Where did you take the gold?
- What?
Did I mishear something
or did he say "gold"?
Yes!
The gold of the convoy.
What?
I think, I know where
this gold ended up.
Don't believe these
fooleries, Santana.
He's making up stories
to save his skin.
It doesn't make any difference
to kill him here or somewhere else.
You forced me to play
dead for two years.
You said the gold
was missing!
In fact, you know where it is!
I want the gold, the gold!
Let's go!
Of what use is this
fraud to you, Johnny?
If Santana realizes
that you've been lying...
...he's got one more
reason to kill you.
You lied as well.
But the last shot's
the one that counts.
Remember, your coffin
is buried in the cemetery, too!
Ah, you know,
gold wakes up the dead.
I'm revived again!
Let's go, Guild!
Stop!
Can you see
something, Ramon?
- Didn't you hear anything?
- Nothing.
Watch out! Everybody down!
On the ground!
Come here, Johnny!
Damn it!
Ross!
Stop shooting!
Go after them!
Hey Guild!
Come! We're off!
Your uncle is strong.
And maybe you revealed
your cards too early.
Now your life isn't worth
that much anymore.
And yours not more
than mine.
I'm sorry.
It's dangerous to be my friend.
I'm too curious.
If I don't count my enemies,
I don't have my peace.
I'm coming with you.
No.
That's my business.
And I have to sort it out by myself.
Okay.
We'll see each other
in one way or another.
If not here...
...then up there.
Or down there.
Goodbye, Horaz.
Come on, quick!
Come on, nobody saw you!
Johnny's waiting for you there.
Thanks! That's all.
Johnny!
Where are you?
Johnny!
It's me, Emily!
I warned you.
No!
No!
I'm begging you, no!
And you couldn't
keep your mouth shut.
Me, no!
No!
That's not true!
I didn't say anything.
I swear!
- I swear!
- Shut up!
- Believe me! Believe me!
- I believe you.
I'm even absolutely sure that you
won't say anything at all anymore.
No!
No.
No, I don't want to
part with my son.
- It must be done.
- I don't want to lose him.
You still regard
him as a boy.
Johnny is ungrateful,
a bullhead, up for everything.
- Without a touch of understanding.
- He's been away for too long.
Would have been better,
if he'd never gotten back.
He needs help.
Why should I stop
helping him?
You promised me,
with his return...
Because it's not easy.
I'm the man who took
his mother away from him.
And he won't
forgive me that.
Listen.
If somebody is in a
hopeless situation...
...he must go
his own way.
And the sooner he goes...
the better for everyone.
Gertie...
it's better for everybody.
If Johnny leaves me...
If I can't meet
him again...
Forgive me, Claude...
But I'll regret it
for my whole life.
What?
What do you want?
That's Johnny's!
- But this was the gun of his father.
- Yes, but I gave it to Johnny.
- What happened to him? Where is he?
- Where did you find it?
- It lay next to my daughter's corpse.
- No! Johnny...
Emily...
No.
Oh no...
No!
That can't be true!
It's absurd,
it's not true!
Oh no...
It's not true...
It is not true...
No...
Back again!
Are we going to dig
someone else out?
- Half the price, 50 dollars.
- No. This time for 5 dollars.
And you have to dig
the deepest grave of them all.
And on the gravstone
you'll engrave:
"Claude Hamilton.
Murderer of his brother."
I'm always on duty.
But for the digging, I need his measures.
Ah, too bad.
She was so young. Poor Emily.
And so beautiful.
I knew, he would
come back here.
- What are we going to do with him?
- Crucify him.
Vamos!
Ride at gallop!
Pull him up!
Pull!
Look!
That's Santana!
We better warn Mr. Claude.
Barricade the gate!
You there, quick!
Hurry up with the cart!
And you, help us!
Come on!
Leave it up there and
get the ammo! Come on!
Boss, Joe gave us a signal:
Santana will be here soon!
Ah, come here.
Listen. Tell the men,
they shouldn't show themselves.
Santana!
It must happen as fast as lightning.
Understood?
He thinks he'll surprise us.
But instead...
- Let everybody know!
- Alright.
Claude!
What's up, sweetheart?
- What's wrong?
- Santana.
You said you killed him to avenge
your brother - my husband.
You lied, he's alive!
Why did you lie?
- But Gertie...
- I want to know where Johnny is!
Tell me.
Tell me!
- Gertie, sweetheart...
- What happened to him? Talk!
- I'm begging you!
- Who shot my husband?
- I want the truth!
- Listen, put the gun away.
No.
What are you scared of?
Are you afraid of me?
Talk!
Who shot my husband?
- Very funny, stop it!
- Stop this masquerade, Claude!
- You don't scare me!
- What's wrong with you?
- Have you gone insane?
- I want the truth!
Gertie, you will regret...
...what you're doing right now...
- Too late!
- I'm already regretting since Johnny...
- Gertie!
Step back, Claude!
Or I'll kill you!
We arrived
just in time, boss.
Boss! Boss!
Santana is here!
To the windows, you two!
Move, knucklehead!
Move!
Attention, he's coming!
Let them come closer!
Come on, guys, let's go!
You brave men!
Folks, here are 300,000 dollars!
They're ours!
Go!
Come on!
Come on!
- Attention!
- Go!
Back into the house!
Cover the other side!
Gertie?
Gertie!
Stop!
Ramon! Go upstairs!
Oh no...
My son didn't do it.
What are you
planning to do here?
It wasn't him.
He loved Emily!
- He didn't kill her!
- He's a murderer!
And he must die.
Up there.
Like all murderers.
That's enough, sheriff!
- Leave this woman alone!
- And her son, too.
- What do you want from them?
- I thought, I told you...
...you should
go out of my way!
And I told you
to go to hell.
So leave,
because he's innocent.
What are you waiting for
to free him?
Would you like
to take his place?
It's reserved for you.
Johnny...
Johnny!
Claude!
Come on, get out, Claude!
Damn...
Ross, Guild!
Santana is dead.
Now we can
leave as well.
Get the horses
ready, quick.
This dirty bastard made it.
But on his own, impossible...
Look for him!
He won't have come far.
What are you doing?
Are you stopping?
And what about Claude?
What will he say if he
finds out that we stopped?
Where else do you want to look for him?
Someone must have given him a horse.
One more reason
to go on, right?
What does it help to ride on, anyway -
in the middle of the night?
Yes, yes.
You're right.
Ross, I'll have a drink.
Are you coming with me?
Let's assume he came here
and he's not alone...
We better
watch out, Guild.
But who should have helped him?
His friend?
That one's even more
worthless than him.
I'll take a short
look around.
Give me a whiskey.
Enjoy every sip.
Because it's the last one.
What are you waiting for?
Drink.
Ross!
Stop!
This fool...
Do you want to end up like Guild?
Come here!
Are you looking
for me, Ross?
Damn it...
Claude!
Too much for that tiny bit
of life that you have left!
And too little for
so many dead people.
Damn!
And it's all gone with the wind...
Very good!
They're rummaging
the earth...
Rivaling the moles...
They rob themselves...
They hate themselves...
They shoot...
They maul themselves...
And now, it's all
gone with the wind.
Hello folks!
Nice day, isn't it?
Yes! Great!
- But the wind's not too shabby.
- Ah, you have to be contended.
But as long as there's work,
there's enough of everything.
It was a day like
this one, Horaz.
Do you remember?
You taught me how to ride.
And there was this voice coming out of
the house: "Don't lose heart, Johnny!"
- Your father.
- "At Gallop!"
"I want to see you run
like the wind."
Yes.
Like the wind...
Let's go, Johnny.
...15 and 16... Fine.
And we only have four coffins.
Right, good boy?
We'll have to go on
a lot of tours today!
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Hey! Hey!
Hey folks!
If you clean up another place,
remember me!
The best gravdigger in Texas!
The best!
At gallop, Johnny!
Just like the wind!
THE END
