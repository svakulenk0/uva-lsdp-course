-
- Man: Whoo, yeah! Whoo!
Well, that's about it.
That's about it for this Independence
Day as the clock rocks 12:00,
ladies and gentlemen,
on July 5th, 1996.
And you know, fellow Americans,
we are now 220 years old.
We've just about, of course,
wiped out the ozone layer.
Uh-huh, we live under
a continual first-stage smog alert,
and there's a brand-new drug--
I don't know if you heard this by now.
Check this out.
You ready for this?
There's a new drug out there
for the kids of America
to bury themselves with.
It's called Crystal Dream.
Can you believe it?
Now listen to this.
You don't drink it. You don't smoke it.
You don't snort it.
And you don't shoot it.
What do you do? I know you're asking.
What do you do with this thing?
Well, what you do
is you put it in your eyes,
and apparently it tells you lies,
all right?
I'll tell you,
all this decadence,
and we still haven't
nuked ourselves outta here.
It's amazing.
With a little luck
and a whole lot of hope,
I think maybe the human race might live
to see another 220 years.
And with that in mind...
Group:
happy birthday, America!
It's all the same
Only the names will change
Every day
It seems we're wasting away
Another place
-   Where the faces are so cold
-
I'd drive all night
Just to get back home
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted
Dead or alive
I'm wanted
Dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep
Sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet
Always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day
By the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone
Well, all you do is think
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
- I'm wanted
- Wanted
Dead or alive
- I'm wanted
- Wanted.
Dead or alive
Oh, I ride
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
- I'm wanted
- Wanted
Dead or alive
And I walk these streets
A loaded six-string on my back
I play for keeps...
Man:
Give me the money!
Open the register
and give me the fucking money now!
Don't hurt her, son.
Can I get, uh,
- Hit the floor, asshole.
- Stay down!
You know,
this really pisses me off.
Your store's got such nice,
clean, filtered fresh air and...
it just takes a couple
of scumbags to stink it up.
I said hit the floor, asshole,
or I'm gonna blow your fucking head off!
You know,
if I had a nickel for every time
some piece of shit pointed a gun at me,
I'd be a rich man.
I'm gonna cut you long,
wide and deep, motor head.
Pump all the gas you can hold.
That's not good business.
Hey, mister.
Got a name?
Harley.
Harley Davidson.
You know, my old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,
there's five rules
when shooting a game of pool for cash.
Lesson number one.
Always shoot
with a cigarette hanging in your mouth.
Can't smoke with no fire, asshole.
I quit.
Lesson two.
Always know the table
before you shoot.
Lesson number three.
Make sure you chalk that stick
real good before each shot.
Lesson four.
Never make a bet...
if you can't pay the debt.
Lesson number five.
If you lose...
stand up straight and tall--
that corner--
and walk like a man.
Woman: I don't believe it.
I don't believe it!
Man:
What up, cowboy?
School's out, boys.
You better get the hell out of town,
cowboy, before my cord snaps.
I'm good to go.
Soon as I got five big bills
in my pocket.
And your woman in my bed.
Well, I ain't got no $500, cowboy.
And there's no way in hell
you're bedding down my woman.
My old man said there'd be blue-bellied,
chicken-shit bastards like you.
You jumped on
the wrong horse, cowboy.
Just in case you didn't notice,
you're the only cowboy in this place.
He ain't no cowboy.
He's more like a pretty boy.
Pretty boy.
Hey, if he's such a pretty boy,
you should be able
to handle him all by yourself.
Together we stand
-   Divided we'll fall
- Son of a bitch.
Pretty boy, huh?
- Whoa!
-   And work together...
Well, now, when things go wrong,
as they sometimes will
And the road you drive
is headed straight up a hill
-   Let's work together...
-
Let's work together
Because together we will stand,
every boy, girl, woman, and man...
Hey, Marlboro,
when the hell are you gonna learn
to hustle guys you can hustle?
You know,
you gotta think things out.
You think, Harley.
I survive.
Where the hell you been, anyway?
Fixing bikes.
Little shithole outside of Dallas.
For two years?
- I've been thinking.
- For two years?
I've been thinking about life.
That's the trouble with you, Harley.
You think too damn much.
Harley: Man, I hate this city,
but it's home, huh?
It's that time again.
Ain't it, Harley?
Well, you're the only
family I got, Marlboro.
God damn,
that's a crying shame.
You know, I could've had a family
with Jenny Ann,
but marriage is for those other guys,
you know?
Amen.
Do you ever wonder...
if there could be something better?
Every day.
No, I don't mean like that.
I mean something--
Something different.
Talking about heaven?
I mean like--
I mean like God.
You didn't go and get religious
on me now, did you?
No, man, but just think about it.
If-- if there is a--
if there is a heaven and a God...
hey, I'd like to meet the dude.
You know, I'd like to go up there
and hang out with him.
Well,
you ain't gonna meet God with me.
When I'm dead and done,
I don't want no damn excuses
for what I did.
Burbank.
What happened?
The future.
You believe it?
They turned Burbank
into a goddamn international airport.
So come on,
stop the world
Stop the world
'Cause this is where I get off
-   Well, you can all carry on
- Stop the world...
Shit.
Son of a bitch.
You're a God damn mess, Marlboro.
You need a new pair of boots
and a new bike.
Lay off my boots.
But you're right about
this rice-grinding horse.
Shit.
Piece of shit.
I ought to give it a bullet
and put it out of its misery.
God damn, Harley.
If you were shooting for shit,
you wouldn't even get a whiff.
Hey.
Happy birthday.
You son of a bitch.
I almost forgot.
.44 Mag Desert Eagle.
Eight in the clip.
One in the pipe.
That's nice, man.
- Thanks.
- How's it feel to be an old man?
Older the bull,
the stiffer the horn.
You gotta squeeze the trigger,
Harley.
Don't yank it.
It's not your dick.
Squeeze it.
All the tears inside
What an ache it will bring...
God, I love this place.
And I will wander home
To a telephone
That forgot how to ring
I could say
you'll soon be back, dear
To fool the whole town
may be smart
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear
But what can I tell my heart?
Hey, old man, half-time's over.
You got a restaurant to run.
Man alive, Harley.
So good to see you.
And I'm gonna regret it.
I always do.
Yeah.
Who are the suits?
Go back to wherever
it is you ran off to.
I can't do that.
I got some unfinished business.
Some business
is better left unfinished.
...all the tears inside
What an ache...
Not this business.
I'll see you around.
Then I'll wander home
To a telephone
Oh, that forgot how to ring
I could say
you'll soon be back, dear
Mmm
To fool the whole town may be smart
I could say you'll soon be back, dear
Oh
But what will I tell my heart?
Oh, whoa, whoa...
You got a death wish?
Huh.
Better leave that one alone, Harley.
Nah, you don't think Jack's
still pissed off, do you?
Pissed off at ya?
Nah.
He wants to kill ya.
Hey, what's happening, Jose?
Look what the cat drug in.
Hey, qué pasa, amigo?
How you doing?
Good to see you.
He says didn't think
you were ever coming back.
Chomping at the bit for some action.
Hey, hey, man, me and you
are gonna rock and roll, brother.
Jimmy and, uh, Jack here?
Said he doesn't think you should go in.
If you do, you're dead.
I knew that you were not alone...
It's better to be dead and cool
than alive and uncool.
$100! What you got?! What you got?!
$200! $200!
Yeah! Place your bets!
Well, God damn.
Does he look like he's gotten bigger?
Maybe a little.
The book is closed!
It is time for the main event!
Get set, gentlemen.
Now I only ask one thing back here!
And that is two things--
be fair and be cool.
- Wrestle!
-
Come on, Jack!
Come on, Jack!
Come on, Jack!
Come on, Jack!
Jack, come on! Come on!
Come on, Jack!
Come on, Jack! Come on, Jack!
Jack, what are you doing?!
Jack! What?! Jack!
-
- God damn it!
God damn it, Harley,
what are you doing back here?
I missed all you guys.
I'm gonna kill you, Harley.
- Told ya.
- Get ready.
Hey, look, Jack,
I don't want to fight with you.
- We're friends.
- Was friends.
- Can't we talk this out?
- Not a chance.
Talk's cheap.
And I'm not buying any.
Oh. Hey, Jimmy.
You wanna help me out here a little?
It's your world, homes.
I'm just living in it.
Hurry up, Harley.
It's gonna be bloody, but quick.
You hold on.
How much do you think we can get
for this jacket?
What'd he say?
Vaya con Dios, amigo.
- What's that mean?
- "Go with God."
Hey, now, Jack,
you know the last time we did this,
I kicked your ass, Jack.
Well, that was in high school,
Harley.
And Jack had a broken arm.
Yeah, well,
I'm the one that did it.
You remember, Jack?
God damn it.
He was doing pretty good
up to there.
Oh...
Ow!
Ooh! Ooh!
- Ow!
- I can't watch this.
Uh-oh,
he's fucked.
I'm gonna kill you, Harley!
I just picked the wrong flower.
I'd kill for you, Harley.
How could you do that to me?
Hey, I've always been bad company
with a good-looking woman in the room.
Stay away from her, Harley.
I love her.
We're married.
It's always only been you, Jack.
She loves you.
She does, huh?
- Just you.
- Never you?
Ah, no. Just you.
Sorry, buddy.
Sorry.
Should've never let you
in the door, Harley.
Yeah, thanks, man.
Never. Never.
- Never.
- Sorry.
God damn it, Jack!
I mean, you're my brother-in-law,
and I love you,
but that don't get back
the couple of grand we lost tonight.
The deal is you lose,
and don't tear his fucking arm off.
The old man
and I have enough problems.
We're just trying to make as much money
as we can before we lose this place.
What do you mean "lose this place"?
You ain't gonna lose this place.
It's a landmark.
Don't mean shit, homes.
If money talks
and bullshit walks, we walking.
And it ain't gonna be
down easy street either.
What's the story, old man?
In '56,
I leased this property
when nobody wanted to be seen
on this side of the hill.
And in '66...
I renewed my lease
on my own terms.
In 21 days,
those 30 years have run out.
And now with the whole world
flying into Burbank,
they're trying to strong-arm us
for $2.5 million
for a five-year lease.
They're gonna put up
another skyscraper.
Who's trying to strong-arm you?
The bank.
What bank?
Great Trust.
Oh, the suits?
Mm-hmm.
Well...
there's only one place
to get that kind of money so fast.
No suit's gonna loan us $2.5 million.
Man:
That's for sure.
Hey, man,
I ain't talking about no loan.
I don't wanna hear it, Harley.
Hear what?
You don't wanna know.
Know what?
He's gonna say
we should rob the bank.
We ain't gonna rob
any damn bank.
We ain't bank robbers.
We owe it to the old man.
We grew up in this place.
You boys don't owe me anything.
Harley:
Sure, we do.
Hell, if it wasn't for you,
we'd all be face-down in the gutter
with a cigarette for company
and a...
a needle for good times.
I'm ready to go.
- Okay baby, in a minute.
- Now!
Count me out of this one.
I made a promise to Lulu.
Yeah, you've made me
a lot of promises, Jack.
We're gonna have a baby someday.
Can't start a family
from behind bars.
You know...
I really love this place.
It's home.
Makes me feel good.
And if we gotta rob a bank to save it...
I'll do that.
But I can't do it alone.
You guys are gonna
have to get it up, too.
Man:
We'll check with you then.
Over.
Roger, Dispatch.
We copy.
Whoa, shit!
Car 3, car 3, this is Dispatch.
Give me your 10-20
and security code, over.
Man:
Dispatch, we're at the shipyard.
What's with this hard hat?
You're gonna have to move your
equipment. I got a delivery to make.
What, are re you fucking deaf?
I said you're gonna have to move your--
I heard what you said.
Drop your gun.
You're not gonna like
what you're getting into, pal.
Harley: Hey, friend, from 15 feet away,
there's a chance you could miss me.
I could be blind as a bat
and still blow your head off.
- So you drop it.
- No, you drop it, asshole.
- Shit!
- Think fast.
Shit.
Come on.
Get over here. Sit down.
Guns are made to be shot, Harley,
not thrown.
Harley: Go do it, Jose.
You're about the deadest shot
I've ever seen.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Read a book.
Came with the gun.
Who are you guys?
Well, he's Harley Davidson.
And I'm the Marlboro man.
You look like a bunch
of two-bit hoods to me.
Now does that look like the work
of two-bit hoods?
Yeah.
Pros would have used my keys.
Well, he likes to blow things up.
Hot stuff.
Watch it.
Nice day for work, huh, Jimmy?
Ha, none better ever.
None better ever, homes.
Nice doing business with you boys.
Your business isn't with us.
It's with them.
Well, whatever they've got to say,
I don't wanna hear it.
Let's rock it!
We got company.
Shit, no.
What the fuck is all this about?!
Hey, Harley, why don't you
throw that shotgun at 'em?
Maybe you'll hit something.
- I thought you was a dead shot.
- So did I.
Then why the fuck ain't they dropping?
Beats the shit outta me.
Come on, guys!
- Come on, Harley.
- Let's go, Jimmy!
Yee-ha!
Jimmy: All right,
you're a big fucking hero, big man!
A big fucking hero!
You guys needed backup!
I had nothing to do
and no one to do it with.
Shit, backup, hell.
Old Harley's thinking here
damn near had us on the ropes.
Saved our lives, big boy.
You guys owe me a bike.
I gotta get a new bike.
Hey, man, you'll get a new bike.
Promise me you won't tell Lulu.
I don't want her getting mad.
She's mean when she's mad.
Hey, look, I can take care of the bike,
but I can't take care of the bitch.
Why not?
You did once.
You boy might wanna
take a look at this shit.
What is it?
Un-melted pure Crystal Dream.
Well, what the fuck is that,
and what the fuck is it doing here?
It's a drug, and I don't know
what the fuck it's doing here.
I'm a son of a bitch.
We jumped the wrong train.
Oh, fuck!
Shit, man.
His little brother OD'ed
using this shit.
Don't worry, Hose,
we ain't drug dealers.
This is not a walk in the park, Harley.
This is way fucking
out there on the edge.
These guys aren't street dealers
dealing grass and pills.
They're killers.
They killed their own men
trying to waste us.
That's enough, Jimmy.
Never liked this plan from the start.
But you needed help,
and you took it.
So don't whine about it now.
What's done is done.
There ain't no turning back.
Man:
Who are these men?
Judging from their ability and data
we gathered, they're dilettantes.
Details would suggest that they were
not aware of the cargo they've stolen.
If they're amateurs,
how'd they destroy two vehicles...
and then manage
to get away with the goods?
- Hmm?
- They were extremely lucky.
Mm.
I don't have time for luck,
now do I?
Get back what's mine.
And kill these men,
Alexander, okay?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, babe.
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah
Whoo...
Oh, man, we really fucked up big.
Marlboro, how the fuck
was I supposed to know
somebody's using a bank
as a front to run drugs?
Harley, I'm tired and I'm pissed.
And I'd just like to unwind.
So stop thinking.
Oh, fuck, man, now I gotta think
of some way to make things right.
- Hi.
- Hey.
I know you don't know me,
but I don't have a way home,
and Jimmy said
that you'd give me a ride.
Sure, I'll give you a ride, Sally.
Oh, the name tag's wrong.
My real name's Honey.
Pure gold
and sweet.
I'm off at 10:00.
Well, my old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,
the right woman can make you,
and the wrong one can break you.
You know,
I woke up one morning...
and she was gone.
No note. No kiss goodbye.
No nothing.
And I still have feelings
for her deep inside.
Well, partner...
I only know of two cures
for that particular ailment.
And since you don't drink anymore,
you're down to one.
Let me borrow your bike.
I gotta take Sally home.
Get a cab.
Stand up and put your hands
behind your head.
Ah, hell, I was just blowing off
a little steam.
Yeah?
Well, You blew in the wrong place.
Now kiss the wall and spread 'em.
Okay, cowboy,
let's blow off some steam.
What's wrong tonight?
I'm getting married.
God damn you, Robert,
I'm tired of waiting around
for you to come by
when you feel the need.
I get lonely.
I like to share my bed
with someone at night.
Hell, isn't that what we're doing?
One, maybe two nights a month,
if I'm lucky.
Well, I am what I am, Virginia.
I've accepted that, even loved it.
But I don't have to like it.
I get scared for you.
I worry.
You could spend the rest of your life
looking for whatever the hell
it is you're looking for,
but someday you're gonna
have to find yourself.
I just can't wait
for you to do it anymore.
I love you, Robert.
But after tonight,
you're not welcome here anymore.
With your long black hair
Fallin' down your face
Red lips and lethal pout
Send me to heaven
Seein' is believin'
Baby, you're so strange...
Oh, fuck.
That's for Marlboro.
Me and you'll go out
and have something to eat.
You're a bad man, Harley.
What are you two up to this time?
Do you know anything
about this new drug, Crystal Dream?
It's 100% addictive and kills
one out of every seven users.
Don't mess with it, Harley.
I don't mess with drugs no more,
you know that.
It's a liquid-based blue crystalline
substance
with a neurotoxin RAH--
retina-activating hallucinogen.
Hmm, so it sort of numbs the senses
and makes the world look better?
Yeah, that's the high.
The low is it damages
the central nervous system,
causes insanity and then death.
On the street it's called "The Dream."
Thank you.
Hey, I'm broke.
You know something, Harley?
In a weird way I'm jealous of you two.
But why's that?
The rest of us work
so damn hard at life, and...
you guys just live it
one day at a time.
Yeah.
See ya.
Hey, what's with you
and them boots?
Lay off my boots, Harley.
I'm in no fucking mood.
Did you have a rough night?
Woke up smelling the coffee.
Gimme a light.
Hey, I thought you quit.
Just give me a light.
Whose bike?
Probably hers.
She ain't got no Harley.
Hey, man, what're you doing?
It ain't hers,
but I'll bet I know whose it is.
Whose?
His.
You gotta cross and cut
the red and the green wire.
I know how to hot-wire a bike, Harley.
Don't tell me how to hot-wire
a God damn bike.
You gotta turn on the gas.
if he's gonna take my girl,
I'm gonna take his bike.
You sure this is the right bank?
Yeah, I'm sure.
How sure?
Hey, man, I'm real sure.
Yeah, well, you were real sure
there was gonna be money
on that armored truck.
You were real sure
this plan was gonna work.
You better be right about this,
or I'm for real sure
gonna break your head
so you can't think no more.
Hey, man, why don't you lighten up?
Tell me about that guy
that's working Virginia.
Don't care.
Didn't ask.
You mean you're gonna let her go
just like that?
From where I stand,
she let me go.
Well, you know, if she wants you
to chase her, that's the game.
My old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,
never chase buses or women.
You always get left behind.
I assume you're here to do business?
Well... I'd like to do some business
with you some other time.
But right now we got to talk
to the man upstairs.
Stay on my tail.
No problem.
Well, looks like we really
rattled the cage, Marlboro.
You know this ain't gonna fly.
I'll bet you it flies.
- How much?
- I'll bet you a dollar.
But if you win, you're gonna have
to give me some credit
'cause that cab fare last night
broke me.
If I win, we're dead.
Well, strap on your seat belt
and get ready to fly.
American Airlines.
You've got something of mine.
And I want it back.
Oh, really?
What is that?
You know something?
You've got balls.
Big ones.
But they're not as big
as you might think.
Well, mister, my balls are big enough
to get your attention.
What do you want?
Oh, how's about two and a half
million dollars?
Nah, wait a minute. Check that.
I got a little side bet going.
Make that two and a half
million dollars plus a buck.
When?
Where?
Airplane graveyard.
Late.
Tonight.
Well, I'll tell you what,
you better call your boys off
or you ain't gonna get nothing.
Yeah.
Talk to you on the rebound... asshole.
Yes, sir?
Let 'em go, Alexander.
Let 'em go.
Okay, let's do it.
Your boys are good...
for dilettantes.
They're not my boys.
They're my friends.
Yeah.
Let's see the crystals.
Let's see the cash.
Hey.
Open it real slow, huh?
Why the extra dollar?
We had a bet.
Okay.
Well, wasn't a walk in the park,
but the job's done.
You did it.
You did it, man.
Check this out, old man.
Besides Jimmy and Lulu
and the rest of you,
this place is what keeps me
coming back day after day.
Thank you for giving that back to me.
I've got things to do.
Tomorrow we open for good.
All right.
All right, Pops.
Whoo!
Oh, man, I am thankful for this.
But you boys are whacked out,
you know that?
I'm talking about you, Harley.
Hey, man,
that's what friendship's about.
Jack: It's done, and it's done good.
So let's take the edge off.
Come here, Marlboro,
get in this.
To Lulu, who'd kill me
if she knew what I helped do.
But because I did it,
she still has a job.
To Lulu.
What's wrong, man?
We done good tonight.
Shit, Harley,
we're way out of our league, man.
It was too easy.
I think we oughta get the fuck
out of Dodge,
let things cool off for a while.
Aw, look at this shit.
Harley:
How the fuck did they find us?
Marlboro:
I don't know.
I damn sure don't wanna find out.
Not this again.
I can't deal with this again, Harley.
The old man has got it under control.
Yeah, tell them we were in,
but we left.
That's right.
That's right, boy.
Take your pussy friends,
get the hell out of here.
Marlboro:
Oops.
I don't think he liked that.
I don't give a flying fuck
what he likes.
We gotta get the hell outta here!
No kidding.
I'm gonna fucking die today, Harley,
and I blame you.
No, we're gonna live, man, and we're
gonna go through that window to do it.
Jack, cover me.
Jack, come on!
Jack:
I'm right behind you!
Jack?!
Jack!
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
-
- Shh, shh, shh.
Lady?
Lady, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.
We don't wanna hurt you.
Take her.
"Take her" he says.
Jesus, lady!
Hey, hey, hey!
This is a restricted area, man.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
You're gonna have to scoot.
I mean fast.
Hey, chump,
in case you don't hear so good,
I said get the fuck outta here!
I hate this fucking town.
Hey, man, you don't know
anything about this city.
I grew up here,
you dumb bastard.
I didn't know that.
Yeah, well,
what you don't know is a lot.
You mean to tell me
that real cowboys,
I mean, shit-kickin' rodeo cowboys,
come from Vegas?
Some of the best.
Maybe even one of the best.
Hey, man,
I know you don't wanna be here.
We're just gonna stay long enough
to clean up and get some sleep.
Yeah, okay.
Did I ever tell you the time
I lost my cherry
to a fat girl in a room just like this?
It was in Mesquite, Texas.
Her name was Annie.
Wasn't too good putting us
up on this top floor like this.
There was a convention in town.
It was all we could get.
Makes for a tough getaway.
Look, partner,
they're not gonna find us here.
- They can't.
- I wouldn't bet on that.
Why don't you stop whining, you know?
You're starting to sound like Jimmy.
Jimmy's dead,
you heartless piece of shit.
Four of our friends got killed tonight.
They're gone.
Fucking tagged-on-the-toe dead.
Does that matter to you?
I mean, do you fucking care?
Hey, Marlboro,
I didn't force anyone to do it.
They took the chance,
and they knew the risk.
All right, hey, look, it's my fault.
And I gotta live with it.
But right now me and you gotta
pull it together if we're gonna survive.
Hello?
Marlboro: Hello.
Hey.
Where are you?
Are you all right?
Las Vegas.
I called because I'm drunk,
and I'm tired.
I just wanted to hear your voice.
Tell me exactly where you are
and what you've done.
-  No.
- And I can help.
No.
Can't do that.
I've already dug too many graves.
None of them my own.
Robert...
you keep running, and sooner or later,
you're gonna end up like your dad.
Drunk, dead and alone,
and all you can do is hold on and wait.
Robert?
Hello?
Are you there?
Harley, let's go.
We got company.
- Hey, I know how they found us.
- Yeah? Well, Tell me later.
Please, God,
let us get out of this one.
I promise I'll change.
That's bullshit, Harley.
I'll fucking try.
Shit.
Up!
They're going up!
Holy shit.
Come on!
We're at death's door, Harley,
and the devil's a-knocking.
So you better think up of something fast
or start your ass praying for real.
Put your gun away.
We're gonna jump.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
You got a better idea?
Well, whatever the hell they're
wearing's made outta die-hard bluesteel.
All right, come on,
take my hand, man.
No!
- It's the only way, man.
- I don't care.
Well, I'm gonna do it.
Do it!
You're gonna get shot up here.
You're gonna get smashed down there.
Hey, man,
I'd rather be smashed than shot.
Not me.
All right.
Fuck you!
You stay up here,
and you get shot and die!
I owe you that.
I hate you for this, Harley.
I fucking hate you for this.
I hate you, Harley!
Oh, shit!
Was that fucking intense or what?
We gotta go back, Harley.
What the fuck you talking about?
We survived.
It's over.
It ain't over.
Hey, man, it's definitely over.
See this?
It's out of commission.
That means that them fuckers can't
keep coming out of nowhere anymore.
We still got a bunch of money
we didn't get for ourselves,
and a bar full
of dead friends in L.A.
It ain't over.
This ain't right.
And we owe it to our friends
to make it right.
Hey, man, I ain't making any plans
for you and me for a long time.
We came out alive.
We came out ahead,
I ain't doing it.
God damn it, Harley.
We ain't ahead.
And if being alive means
living on the run, then I don't want it.
Marlboro, you do
what you think is right, right?
I'm gonna stay alive.
Better to be dead and cool...
than alive and uncool.
Midnight
Streetlight
Shadows
At your feet...
What do you want?
Virginia.
She's asleep.
Wake her up.
Man:
Why the fuck is here here?!
Though I want you so...
- Just calm down.
- Man: I am calm!
To stay
I'm standing on the hard line
Taking my sweet time...
You've got until we reach the sidewalk
to say what you've got to say.
Mr. Trigger-happy a cop too?
He just made lieutenant.
He the guy?
What do you want, Robert?
You want my help?
My sympathy?
My hand in marriage?
What?
I don't know what I want.
But I know what I don't want.
I don't want
whatever there was between us...
to end without telling you...
you've been the better part of my life.
The best part of my life.
I'm standing on the hard line...
Goodbye, Virginia.
Robert?
I'm slow to change...
Been fighting on the front line
Victim of a heart crime
Can't just let you steal my heart
Away.
Sorry I'm late.
I had a layover in Denver.
Are you and me friends?
Sure, we're friends.
Then how come,
with all the shit that me
and you have been through,
I've asked you the same question
a thousand times
and you ain't never answered me?
What question?
What's with you
and those fucking boots?
My old man gave me these boots
first time I rode
in a professional rodeo.
It was the first and last thing
he ever gave me.
Hey, Marlboro,
you could've told me that.
Just kind of figured
it was between him and me.
I got throwed
and busted my arm in four places.
Hey,
I think you should do it again.
Someday.
Maybe.
The hell'd you get that hog leg?
Denver.
This is a Ruger Super Blackhawk.
God damn, Harley,
that's too much gun for you.
This is what I learned with.
Nobody learns
with a converted 454.
I did.
That explains it.
I've been through
a lot of shit in my life.
But up until about three weeks ago,
the only God damn thing
I ever shot at was tin cans.
You know, I never wanted
to shoot at nobody in anger.
And I sure as shit
ain't never wanted to kill nobody.
Me, neither.
Take up a heading of zero one zero.
They're seven clicks northeast of here.
Sounds like the same heading
my co-pilot shouted out
the day we choppered into Khe Sanh.
Last thing the ugly bastard ever said.
Shut the fuck up and fly, Tom.
Okay. Okay.
Well, God, if you do exist
and you're up there watching
from wherever it is
you're watching from...
just look away for a minute.
Marlboro: Remember,
these bastards are bulletproof.
So aim for their heads,
dead center.
You might wanna hold
onto that cannon with both hands.
Don't yank.
Don't pull.
Squeeze.
You ready?
Let's rock and roll these motherfuckers.
Let's make things right.
You know, that gun costs about two bucks
every time you fire it.
That's two bucks a bullet.
Well, how many did I hit?
You spent 12 bucks
and didn't hit a God damn thing.
I nailed one,
and it cost four and a quarter.
Where'd they go?
Right there,
and they're spending a fortune.
We really pissed them off this time.
No shit.
Come on, let's go.
Harley?
Are you shooting?
- Harley?
- What?!
That's two for me.
You better get off your ass, Harley.
Hey, give me a fucking break.
God knows I'm trying.
You better ask God for some help.
We ain't done yet.
Fuck! Shit! Piss!
Horseshit in a bear's ass!
Two bucks.
That's four.
Six.
You're gonna die today.
If you wanna make it fast,
tell me where the money is.
If you wanna make it slow, don't.
It's your choice.
It's a good day for dying.
I'll do it slow.
Harley: Hey, slick.
Cut him loose.
Oh, shit.
I'm a dead man.
Where is the money?
Where is the money?
Squeeze it, Harley.
Just squeeze it.
Agh!
- Shit.
- Shit!
That hurt, Harley.
That hurt bad.
Looks like your luck just ran out.
Now, where is the money?
Shoot him, God damn it!
Keep shooting.
You'll make my job easier.
Shoot the bastard!
Don't think, just shoot him!
Shoot him!
Marlboro: Well, that one's for you.
How'd it feel?
- Best 12 bucks I ever spent.
-
Agh... son of a bitch.
How you feeling?
Oh...
Like I've been rode hard
and put up wet.
Well, shake it off.
We got one more.
Let's go.
I can't believe
you fucking shot me, Harley.
Dickhead,
you fucking shot me.
Can't believe you shot me,
you shit bird.
Pilot: I find it hard to believe
you greased those cue balls.
But it's a good thing somebody did.
Yeah?
Why's that?
They were pussies.
Their clothes were made out of
that lightweight Japanese Kevlar.
All right, pal,
this is your last paycheck.
You work for us now.
Here's what we'll do.
As soon as I ask him
to change the lease and he says no,
just shoot his ass dead.
Why me?
I'm all out of bullets.
Yes, Howard,
it's good to hear from you, too.
Now, uh, what do you want from me?
Spit it out.
Uh-huh.
Uh, listen, How-- Howard,
I'm not interested
in the third world, okay?
There's too much can go the wrong way
and not much that can go our way.
Now, we've had this discussion.
I don't want to have it again, okay?
Listen, Howard, say hello to your wife.
You're married, aren't you?
Looking for Chance Wilder.
You him?
That's right.
Deal away, Harley.
Well, here.
This is yours. We took it.
Wasn't right of us.
So now you can change the lease back
to the Rock 'N' Roll Bar and Grill.
No handouts.
No breaks.
Just a fair deal,
that's all we're asking.
You guys must be charmed...
to have made it this far.
Well,
four of our friends are dead.
No, we're not charmed.
We're just pissed off.
That's too bad.
Oh!
That's too bad.
Sorry I pissed you off.
Listen...
the lease stands, okay?
So that's the end of that story.
So if you came here to kill me,
do it now.
If not,
get the fuck out of here.
I don't have the time to play
with guys like you, okay?
I'm very busy.
Hey, this ain't a game.
All business is a game
one way or another.
Selling drugs ain't no game.
It's not your average game,
that's true.
I make $500,000 a year to sit
in this office and run this bank, okay?
I make another $50 million a year to sit
in the same office and run those drugs.
Now, that's a big game,
and it's big-time.
Well, game's over.
Go ahead and do it, Marlboro.
What are you waiting for?
Just kill him and let's get
the fuck out of here.
I can't do it.
It's not right.
Hey, this scumbag killed
four of our friends just for laughs.
Still doesn't make it right.
What are you talking about?
My old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,
never shoot an unarmed man.
Marlboro, fuck your old man.
Your old man's dead.
Leave my old man
out of this, all right?
All right. Here.
Now he's armed.
That gun's empty, Harley.
So what?
This piece of shit
gives drugs to kids.
Drop it!
You guys, did you really think you were
just gonna walk in here and shoot me?
You--
you thought that, didn't you?
That was the plan.
Yeah, that was the plan.
You guys--
you guys are a piece of work.
You got an edge.
And I like that.
I do. I like that.
It almost makes me sorry
that I have to kill you.
But I-- I do. Hmm.
I do right now.
What'd you do?
Did you pay him?
No, man, that was your money.
You paid him.
He did that for free.
You guys.
Like your buddy said,
fuck your old man.
He's dead, right?
Fuck him.
Let's see what you're made of, huh?
Think fast!
Harley!
- Good timing.
- I told you to shoot the fuck.
Hey, guns are made to be shot,
not thrown.
I was just trying to even the odds.
Where you going this time?
Who says I'm going?
You always do, Harley.
It's that time.
You wanna come with me?
Can't.
I shouldn't have asked.
You never say yes.
- Get the hell outta here.
Vaya con Dios, amigo.
Announcer:
This is Robert Lee Edison,
a third-generation cowboy
with his own brand of misery.
He hails from Las Vegas, Nevada,
and hasn't seen the back
of a bull's neck
since he got off real hard
in the National Finals Rodeo
seven years ago.
Let's see what he gets done
on a bull called Hondo,
the top bull
of the Diamond S rodeo company.
Okay, big boy,
let's make it a good one.
Outside!
Outside!
Okay, cowboy.

Life flashing before me
So tell me what does that mean?
And why does it bore me?
Come on
Let me show you how to do it
I hear the radio
and the songs that they play
Makin' my stomach turn
I just want to hear some rock 'n' roll
I watch my radio burn
Come on
Let me show you how to do it
Well, come on, yeah
Let me show you how to do it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right, yeah

leading plastic lives
Substitute child,

The family cries when the TV dies
Come on

Let me show you how to do it
Whoa, oh, yeah.
