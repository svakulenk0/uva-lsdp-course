Hurry, Doc! Hurry!
- What is it, a baby or a shooting?
- A baby!
Don't forget the grand opening
tomorrow night...
of the Bella Union.
Pretty girls.
Sweet singers of southern song.
Hello, Carter.
I see you're opening up here.
Yep. They run me out of Lordsburg.
Well, boys, in a couple of hours, you'll
be buying your drinks across that bar...
at the Palace of Pleasure.
Listen to this, Eddie.
"Yesterday, Big Nose Jackson
was buried in Boot Hill.
"He was shot to death
by an unknown party.
"Joe Triplett, who officiates
as coroner...
"when not busy in the assay office,
rendered the following verdict:
"Body rich in lead...
too badly punctured
to hold whiskey."'
"We are growing rapidly,
but it is getting to be a question...
"whether the city or the cemetery
will be the larger.
"If the city can just keep a few steps ahead
of the burial ground...
"we are bound to become the most
flourishing camp in the Southwest.
Watch us grow."
- Hiya, boss.
- Hi.
Been eatin' dust for 10 hours.
- Got anything to drink in there?
- A drop or two.
You stay with the horses, Charlie.
Can't let Charlie drink.
Sees little bugs.
We'll send you out some agua.
Agua.
- Have any trouble, Curly?
- Nope. Got the stage comin' through the pass.
Driver handed over the money
like it was a real pleasure.
- How are things around here?
- Not so good.
Bella Union getting all the play, eh?
Yeah. Jerry and those girls from Chicago
are drawin' 'em in like flies.
Sure doin' a land office business
over there.
- Hey, maybe we can do something about it.
- What do you mean?
Charlie.
- For me?
- Sure. Take a big swig.
- More?
- Take all you want.
Rock-a-bye, baby
in the treetop
When the wind blows
the cradle will rock
Out of the way!
Come on.
What's the trouble?
Indian Charlie.
He-He's killed Plush Sullivan.
Maybe some more folks by this time.
He's a-tearin' our place up.
- Go over and get him, Marshal.
- Not me, Mr. Henderson. I aim to live a while.
- What's that?
- I'm not gonna walk over there
and get my head blown off.
Mr. Marshal, as mayor of Tombstone,
I order you to arrest him.
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor,
but I got a wife and kids.
And Charlie ain't the kind
that you can arrest when he's rampaging.
Why, I wouldn't have a chance. He'd fill me full
of lead before I got halfway through that door.
- Oh, so you won't do it?
- A nice lot of law you got here.
- Who said that?
- I did.
- Who are you?
- Just a visitor tryin' to get some sleep.
But how can I with all this whoopin'
and a-yellin' and a-shootin'?
What kinda town you got here?
A drunk goes loco with a gun and...
- Oh, you talk too much.
- Maybe, but if it was any of my business...
I'd go across there and pull
that tinhorn out by the heels.
- Oh, you would, would you?
- If it was any of my business.
Yes? Well, you come down here,
and I'll make it your business.
I'm deputizing you as marshal.
Go on.
Drag him out by the heels.
All right.
Lend me a gun?
Here it is.
Don't worry.
You'll never get to use it.
You know who he is?
No. But we'll find out
at his inquest.
You're under arrest.
Put down those guns.
You heard me.
Put those guns down.
What did I told you?
I don't reckon Charlie give him
much of a chance to use my gun.
Do you see what I see?
He ain't dead.
Just sorta grazed him.
He'll come to in a few minutes,
and you can lock him up.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll go back and get some sleep.
- Who are you?
- My name's Earp.
- Wyatt Earp?
- You know me?
Certainly have heard of you.
General Miles says
you're the best scout the army ever had.
What brings you to Tombstone?
Prospecting?
No. Thought I might
start a stage line.
No, we got two here now
that I run.
No room for another one.
How would you like to be marshal?
- Me?
- Yes. Job pays 500 a month and fees.
- No.
- Now listen...
Sorry, but I've had
enough of gun-totin'.
Nah. You're fired.
Turn around and move.
- Who is it?
- Earp.
Just a minute.
- Why, Earp, what happened?
- That job of marshal still open?
- Yeah.
- Then I'll take it.
- Good.
- Do these go with the job?
Sure do.
Let me get my pants on.
I'll go with you.
Ain't gonna be no more volunteer
marshals around this camp!
Put it up on the bar!
Don't reach.
Don't you lads try anything.
You might get me, but first
I'll blast him right in the belly.
You two boys and Curly Bill,
get goin'.
What's up?
I got a little business
with these boys out on the mesa.
Oh, I see.
Think you'd better take
the guns from 'em?
Nope. I'd just as soon
they try to use 'em.
Get goin'.
Come on. Get down.
Take off those guns.
Throw 'em away.
Now let's see what you can do
when nobody's holdin' me.
Just keep 'em up.
Get this, and get it
good and clear.
From now on,
I'm the law in Tombstone...
and I don't wanna see
hide nor hair of you in the camp.
Come and see Eddie Foy,
the funnyman...
- tonight at the Bella Union!
- Can I have one, sonny?
Eddie Foy! Eddie Foy!
How you like that, boss?
- Very good, Pete. Very good.
- I think it's pretty good.
Must be costing you plenty
to get Foy down here.
Yep. Carter tried to get him
for his Palace of Pleasure...
but my dough talked
louder and quicker than his.
Nothin' ain't too good
for the Bella Union.
- Someday I figures on getting Lillie Langtry.
- Yeah?
- Jenny Lind and all of them.
- Hmm.
- Is Foy on it?
- He better be.
Supposin' he gets cold feet
and backs out?
Well, I still have Jerry.
Stand back, villain
Go your way
Here I will no longer stay
Although you are a marquis
Or an earl
Why, you may tempt
the upper classes
With your villainous demitasses
But heaven will protect
The working girl
I've taken a fancy to you
I took but a glance and I knew
There's something about you
that pleases the eye
Makes me sigh
I wonder why
I've known you forever it seems
You've shown up in all of my dreams
- But now I'm awake
and my dreams have come true
I'm full of romance
and I've taken a fancy
To Y-O-U
Oh, heaven
Will protect
The working girl
The working girl
- Come on, gals. Get to work.
And may heaven protect you.
Hiya, partner.
Hello, slugger.
No, a little later.
- Jerry, how are ya?
- Come on, Jerry. Give me luck.
- No, I'll see you later.
- Jerry, have a little drink with...
I say, would you mind singing
"The Old Kent Road" for me?
Yeah, a little later, matey. I ain't forgot me London.
Well, Jerry, old girl.
Another bottle of wine.
- Another bottle.
- Come on. Sit down and take a hand, huh?
- Nah, I just think I'll stand here
and watch for a minute. Go ahead.
- How many?
Well, l-I could stand pat,
but I'll... I'll take two.
Three of your best.
- Come on. Let's keep out the grocery clerks.
- I'm out.
Guess your three
are better than mine.
Attaboy.
Deal me out of this hand.
Hey, Jerry, Jer...
Hey, where's that guy
goin' with Jerry?
Hey, what's the idea?
What do you want?
I don't think I'd do that
anymore if I was you.
- Do what anymore?
- You got a pretty little neck, sister...
but if you don't keep it out of card games,
somebody's gonna twist it right off.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Keep your hands off of me!
Hey, put me down!
Leave go of me!
Leave go of me, will ya?
- Think it over while you're cooling off.
- Aw, shut up!
I'll get somebody to fix you!
- Hey, what'd you do with Jerry?
- I sent her home to change her dress.
What's the idea?
I liked the dress she had on.
So did I, but it took Mr. Blackmore's mind off
his cards. Isn't that right, Mr. Blackmore?
- Whose deal?
- I'll buy a stack.
It's Doc Halliday.!
What's up?
Keep on playin'.
Act like nothin' happened.
- What has happened?
- Doc Halliday just come in.
He's the coldest killer in these parts.
Always lookin' for trouble.
He can throw a gun faster...
Shh. Look out.
He's comin' this way.
Newton, I hear you've been bragging
about what you were going to do if...
- Who, um, me?
- Yes.
And take your hat off
when I talk to you!
- Take hold and pull your gun.
- Not me.
- Ah, come on.
- I don't want any handkerchief
duels with you, Doc...
or any other kind of a fight.
No? Well, maybe this
will change your mind.
Are you gonna sit by and watch me
treat your friend like this?
Uh, he-he ain't
no friend of mine, Doc.
He'd better not
try anything with me.
I don't like the way
you're running this town.
And I especially don't like the way
you treated a certain young lady.
Take hold of...
You always want an edge,
don't you, Blackmore?
Suppose you wait till he quits coughing.
Thanks, Mr. Earp.
Now if you'll please step aside...
No, Doc. I'm the marshal here, you know.
I got to keep the peace.
Yes. Of course, of course.
- Will you join me in a drink?
- Glad to.
Better try another camp.
This one's unhealthy.
- What can I do for you senors?
- Whiskey.
Whiskey, eh?
Milk for you.
- That's right, Pete.
- Doc always drink milk.
He never drink whiskey.
Una leche. One milk.
Papa, papa, the stage is coming!
The stage is coming!
Pablo, ven aqui.
Ven, Pablo.
- Hello, Pablo.
- You ought to be home with your mother.
I'm his mama and his papa.
And someday I'm gonna be his grandpa too.
Pablo is very good boy.
He has no mama. He only has me.
If there only were a school.
There's gonna be one soon.
Anderson and I were talking it over yesterday.
Oh, that's fine.
Then Pablo can go there.
And I bet you he be the smartest boy there.
Smart like his papa.
Oh, I'm pretty clever himself.
Giddap!
Welcome to Tombstone, Mr. Foy.
- Mr. Foy, welcome to Tombstone.
- Well, I'm glad to be here.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want you to meet Eddie Foy...
the greatest comedian in the world.
Tonight at 9:00
he'll be at the Bella Union.
Come one, come all, and laugh your cares away.
Howdy, folks.
Is this my hotel?
Yes, sir. Follow me.
Your baggage will be taken care of.
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm in a hurry. Business in Tucson.
Now this was originally
a Buntline special...
but I had the barrel cut down about two inches
and the trigger dogs smoothed down.
Mm. Nice piece of hardware.
Personally, I've been using
a Colt.45 single-action six-gun.
I guess the barrel's longer
than yourn. Let's see.
No, no! No, senor! No.
Doc, can I talk
with you a minute?
- Oh, yes, of course. Excuse me, will you?
- Sure.
So that's the way you're takin' care
of Earp for me.
Why, you've got him all wrong, my dear.
Wyatt's a fine fellow.
Hmm. A fine feller
after what he done to me.
Well, Jerry, if he threw you in the water trough,
I guess you had it comin' to you.
Oh, yeah? Well, he may be all right
to you, but he ain't to me.
No tinhorn marshal's gonna throw me
in a horse trough and get away with it.
Well, forget about Earp.
Is that a new dress?
Yeah. Yeah.
- You like me in it?
- Come here.
I like you in anything.
Gee, you're sweet.
You know, Doc,
I've been thinkin' about you all day.
Do you ever think of me
when I ain't with you?
- Yeah.
- Lots?
Too much.
You know, sometimes when you look at me
like that, I could break you in two.
Well, why don't you?
Come on. Break me.
Look, Doc, I'm getting off early tonight.
Maybe we could...
No, no. Not tonight.
- Where you going, Doc?
- Faro bank. I feel lucky. See you later.
Hey, Jerry, where've you been?
How's about you and me findin' a cozy corner
and a nice cold bottle of wine, huh?
If it's all right with you, cutie, I'll take a rain check.
Something I can do for you, lady?
Yes. I'm looking for John Halliday.
John? Oh, you mean Doc Halliday?
Yes.
Uh, you'll find him over there,
buckin' the tiger.
Sarah.
Hello, John.
What are you doing here?
Cash me in. Come on.
Let's sit over here.
Can I... get you
something to drink, to eat?
No, John.
- Did you just arrive on the stage?
- Yes.
How did you find out where I was?
Well, I've been searching
for two years.
Why did you do it, John?
What else was there to do?
I couldn't fasten
a dying man onto you.
I was a sick dog,
and I snuck away like a sick dog.
Without even saying good-bye.
- I felt it was best that way.
- Best for you perhaps.
I hoped it would be for you too.
It wasn't very flattering to me, John,
for you to think my love so weak.
No. No, Sarah.
I knew you'd insist on going through
with the marriage no matter what.
That's why I left.
I couldn't take advantage of you.
- That's why I had to leave.
- And now you see it was no use.
Here I am.
Yes, here you are.
- But you can't stay, Sarah. You've got to go.
- Why, John?
Because it's not right.
You don't know me. I'm a stranger.
- You?
- Yes, Sarah. Sick or well...
I'm not the John Halliday
you knew back in Illinois.
I'm nothing like him. There's no resemblance
at all. You don't know...
Oh, I do know.
They've told me all about you.
In Dodge City, in Globe, in Tucson,
in Lordsburg, all through the West.
"Doc Halliday, the killer, '
they called you.
"Killer"?
John Halliday, the kind young doctor
who leaned over sick babies all night?
John Halliday, who cried
when Mrs. Foster died in childbirth?
- John Halliday...
- I don't want to hear anymore.
Yes, I'm a killer. What of it?
Life's nothing... my life, anybody's life.
What's the difference
what happens to a lot of rats...
caught in a trap...
what they do, how they act?
Sarah, you've got to go.
No, John.
I've searched too long.
But I don't want you.
- You don't mean that, John.
- Yes, I do. It's got to be that way, Sarah.
You don't know everything. You'd leave
quickly enough if I told you...
All right, Doc.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Thanks, Jerry, darling.
So, now you see
how things stand, don't you?
There's a stage out in the morning.
Go on back where you belong
and leave me alone.
There's a side door over there.
I think you'll find it's the quickest way out.
Hello, Doc. Oh, I know.
I got it for you right away.
Here's your milk.
Who said I wanted that?
Whiskey.
Whiskey?
Sure, si, whiskey.
What's the matter? Didn't you ever
see anybody drink whiskey before?
No. I never see you drink whiskey.
Well, you're seein' me now.
I think I do.
- They're gonna do it. They're gonna do it.
- Do what?
Hurrah our show tonight...
the Palace of Pleasure crowd.
Oh, I've heard some talk about 'em
makin' trouble here, but don't worry.
- Nothing's gonna happen.
- Well, but are you sure, mister?
L- I've got a lot of money
tied up in Foy.
Forget all about it.
That's what I'm here for...
to give you protection and see
that nobody bothers you.
- Take it easy.
- Yeah, l-l-l-I don't know.
Come in.
I've come for you, Foy.
Oh, yes? I'll be ready in a minute.
There's a big crowd
over at the Bella Union?
- I wouldn't know. You ain't goin' there.
- What did you say?
I said you wasn't goin'
to the Bella Union.
You're gonna do your act
at the Palace of Pleasure.
Why, there must be some mistake.
The Palace did make me an offer,
but my contract calls for...
Don't talk so much and finish up.
We'll pay you your dough.
But you better be funny.
Oh, yes. Uh, I'll be funny, all right.
I'll do my best.
Might be a little nervous,
but I guess that happens.
Well, guess we'll get along now, eh?
Ladies and gents,
we got a big surprise for you tonight.
Instead of appearin'
in that cheap joint across the street...
like maybe you seen advertised,
Eddie Foy will appear here.
Now, I don't need to tell you
how good he is.
You maybe seen him in other camps.
But anyhow, you've heard about him.
- Eddie Foy!
- All right. Don't try nothin'funny.
- Nothing funny?
- You know what I mean. I'll be right here with this.
Go on.
All right. Give him a hand.
Sunday morning just at 9:00
Dan McGinty dressed so fine
Stood looking up
at a very high stone wall
When his friend, young Pat McGann
Says I'll bet five dollars, Dan
I could carry you to the top
without a fall
So on his shoulders he took Dan
to climb the ladder he began
And he soon commenced
to reach up near the top
When McGinty
the cute old rogue
To win the five, he did let go
Never thinking
just how far he had to drop
Oh
Down went McGinty
to the bottom of the wall
And though he won the five
he was more dead than alive
Sure, his ribs and nose and back
were broke from getting such a fall
Dressed in his best suit of clothes
- Hello, Doc.
- Get away from me.
Doc... He drink whiskey
like crazy man.
Yeah, I been noticin'.
Always Doc says
whiskey no good for him.
He say, "Someday when I want
a quick way out, I drink whiskey."
- "Quick way out," eh?
- Yeah, that's what he told me.
- They... They've kidnapped him.
- Who?
- Eddie Foy. He's over at the Palace of Pleasure.
- Yeah?
Maybe he changed his mind,
and that's where he wants to be.
No, it ain't. They came over to the hotel
and got him. It was Buck Newton.
Oh. In that case,
I better look into it.
- Where you goin', Earp?
- Over the Palace of Pleasure.
They've kidnapped Foy.
I'll go with you.
There might be some excitement.
Stop it.
Stop it and come down
off of there.
Come with me, Mr. Foy.
You belong across the street.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Go on. Drop 'em.
Pringle, we mustn't disappoint
the audience.
Suppose you get out there
and finish that dance yourself.
- Who, me?
- Hey, music.
But, Doc, l-I can't dance.
Go on, dance!
Aren't you oversteppin'
your authority, Marshal...
- comin' in here and interfering in my business?
- I've been pretty patient...
with you, Carter, but if you insist,
I'll lock you up for kidnapping.
- Wasn't that shooting I heard?
- Yeah, over the Palace of Pleasure.
A man named Doc Halliday just shot a man
who tried to shoot the marshal.
Any of you other gentlemen care
to shoot Mr. Earp in the back?
Come on.
Let's clean the whole place out.
No, no. No more, Doc.
We've done our job.
Come on.
Let's go back to Bella Union.
Come on, Mr. Foy!
Here's your comedian,
not much the worse for wear.
Thanks, Marshal.
Glad to see you alive, Mr. Foy.
- I need a drink.
- Come with me.
- Whiskey.
- Oh, si. Whiskey.
- Keep on with that, you'll be dead before morning.
- Yeah? Good.
Even if you don't kill yourself
with that stuff, Doc...
somebody'll kill you sure
before the night's out.
You wouldn't stand a Chinaman's chance
of defending yourself.
I can take care of myself.
I don't need anybody to look after me.
- I know what I'm doing.
- Now, listen, Doc...
Oh, what's the difference anyway?
She's gone away.
Why you sendin' her away, Doc?
Why?
What do you want me to do, saddle her
with this rotten, stinking body?
I don't want to talk about it.
You keep out of my affairs.
- Doc, don't drink anymore.
- Huh?
Please don't, Doc.
You've had enough.
You leave me alone, or I'll twist your neck.
Go on. Go away.
I don't like you.
I think I'll finish you off right now.
Doc.!
- Why, you-you broke my-my glass!
- I don't like you either!
No, Doc!
You didn't have to do that.
- If you'd have left him to me,
I'd have taken care of him.
- Hey, Bill, lend me a hand.
Don't let a little shooting
annoy you, Mr. Foy.
The boys don't mean
no harm by it.
- That's just their way of having fun.
- Well, that's very nice...
but I was under the impression
I came here to cause the fun.
So you did, Mr. Foy.
So you did.
- And if you're half as funny
as I have heard you are...
You'll have nothing
to worry about.
Where's Eddie Foy?
Hey, where's Eddie Foy? No?
Oh, there you are.
Hey, I was a-watchin' you over
at the Palace of Pleasure dancin'...
when you was so rudely interrupted.
Now I wanna see you dance again.
- I know, but I was just dancing...
- I said dance!
Now, gentlemen,
the drinks are on me.
- Who is it?
- It's the marshal.
Has anything happened to John?
No, no.
I got to talk to you tonight.
Well, just a minute.
- What is it?
- You leaving town tomorrow?
- Yes.
- You mustn't.
- Mustn't? Why not?
- Because Doc needs you. You can't go away.
Well, it isn't a question
of my going away.
John is sending me away.
Ma'am, l... I don't know what you've been to Doc.
I know very little about you and him.
- But I can tell you this: If you leave, he's a goner.
- A goner?
Doc ain't caring
what happens to him...
and I've got a hunch that you're the only one
that can make him care.
No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.
John doesn't need me.
Not anymore.
Aren't you talking
to the wrong person?
Say, you don't think Jerry means
anything to him, do you?
- Well, doesn't she?
- Not a thing. She's crazy about him...
but as far as he goes,
she's just a...
You're the only one that counts.
It isn't her picture
he's carrying around in his wallet.
Doc's eatin' out
his heart over you.
He wants you, but he doesn't
want to saddle you with a sick man.
- Between the two notions, he's almost loco.
- Well, what can I do?
Stay and put up a fight.
If anybody can save him, you can.
If I were just sure you were right.
I am right.
You're his only chance.
What do you say?
- All right. I'm going to stay.
- Good.
- Don't let Jerry bother you.
I think I can take care of her.
- Thank you. You're very kind.
Doc'll need a lot of tender nursing
when he comes to.
- I'll take care of him.
- That's fine. Good night, ma'am.
Good night.
I want to talk to you
a minute, Jerry.
- What about?
- Doc. Come on.
Oh.
- Sit down, Jerry.
- I can hear just as good standing.
Take it easy. I'm not here to rawhide you.
I'm going to ask you for a favor.
You ask me a favor?
- Yeah, I want you to give Doc a break.
- Do what?
- He's in a bad way, Jerry,
and you're not good for him.
- Oh, no?
No. But there's somebody
in town who is.
And if you think a lot of Doc and want
to help him, you'll get out of her way.
Her way? You talkin' about that
high-nosed dame over the hotel?
Say, listen. Doc doesn't care
two hoots about her.
Oh, yes, he does.
More than he'll ever care for anyone.
- She means life to him.
- What am I, a funeral?
- Say, does Doc know you're talking to me?
- No.
No? Well, wait'll he finds out.
He'll twist that tin star around your heart.
Doc don't stand for anybody
buttin' into his affairs, and I don't neither.
Say, if you like the dame so well,
why don't you grab her off for yourself?
- Now, listen, Jerry...
- I won't.
You've been buttin' into
my affairs ever since you came here.
You try and bust up things
between Doc and me...
and I'll make it
the sorriest day of your life.
- I want to talk with you.
- What's up?
- Got a complaint from the Palace of Pleasure?
- No.
No, it serves Pringle right.
- I want you to ride shotgun
on my stage tomorrow.
- Yeah? Why?
There may be nothing to it, but a rumor has come
to me that Curly Bill might try a holdup.
- We're shipping out a lot of bullion.
- I see.
Now here's the plan.
We'll ship tomorrow...
that is, Sunday instead of Monday...
and maybe throw them off their guard.
- Good idea.
- You won't have to ride the
stage all the way to Tucson.
Just go as far as Grainger's ranch.
He'll give you a horse to come back with.
- Okay.
- Stage leaves about 6:00 in the morning.
What's the matter with you galoots?
Ain't you ever seen a lady's ankle?
- How's your mine doing?
- Doing very good. She's running
about 500 or 600 to a ton.
Well, this is a good place to spend it.
- Hey, Ben.
- Why, hello, Jerry. What are you doing here?
- I want to talk to you alone for a minute.
- All right.
Come on back to the office.
Well, Jerry.
What's on your mind?
- What'll you give for a
valuable piece of information?
- What kind of information?
The stage is going out tomorrow instead
of Monday with a load of silver.
- Why should that interest me?
- Earp's riding shotgun, and
I know you don't like Earp.
Hmm. What else do you know?
Well, I happen to know that you
and Curly Bill are like that.
You're a smart girl, Jerry. Are you playing me
for a sucker, or do you want a cut in?
No, there's only one way
you can cut me in.
See that Curly Bill
takes care of Earp.
- Oh, you don't like him either.
- No, I don't like him either.
The happiest day of my life
will be when I can spit in his coffin.
- Leaving town, Mr. Foy?
- Yes, if I live that long.
Oh! Say, can I ride
up there with you?
Sure. Hop right up.
- All ready, Bill?
- Yup.
I don't think it'll be very safe
for you up there, Mr. Foy.
It isn't very safe for me in there either,
Mr. Marshal.
Huh?
Doc, where are you going?
Tucson.
Mr. Foy, you mind holding these?
Get going, Bill.
I'll ride inside with Doc.
Giddap!
How come you're riding shotgun?
Bullion.
I'm taking it as far as Grainger's.
We may have a visit
from Curly Bill.
Hmm. Well.
Doc!
- Say, where is he?
- I don't know. He was here at daybreak.
Oh, at daybreak.
So you were with him, eh?
Well, he ain't here now. You've driven him away,
that's what you've done. Why, you...
Hmm. You girls lookin'
for Doc Halliday?
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- He's gone.
- Oh, I know that. But where?
- He took the stage this mornin'.
The stage?
Are you sure he took the stage?
- Sure I'm sure. I seen him get in.
- They'll kill him.
They hate him as much as they do Earp.
They'll kill him, I tell you!
That's what they'll do!
Who'll kill who?
What are you talking about?
Is John in danger?
Tell me. What is it?
Curly Bill and his gang, they...
Oh! What have I done?
Oh, what have I done?
- Well, what have you done?
What's the matter? Tell me!
You don't think I got any pleasure
out of hittin' you over the head, do you?
- I saw you headin' for trouble...
- Suppose I was.
After all, I am marshal of Tombstone.
When you started to take a shot
at my favorite bartender...
What you did at the Bella Union,
I don't care about.
It's interfering in my personal affairs.
- Did it ever occur to you to
mind your own business?
- Yes, quite often.
- I thought we were friends.
- We were, but that gave you
no right to do what you did.
I had my own plans
for ending a certain situation...
and it would've ended that way
if you hadn't interfered.
- That's right. I did talk to her.
- Yes. And since the lady has decided to stay...
there's nothing left
for me to do but go.
So, you see, Mr. Earp, sticking your nose into
my business hasn't changed things any.
L... I'm sorry you feel that way about it.
I thought I was doing you a good turn.
She's a wonderful gal, Doc. And you'd never
be a burden to her... not to her.
You know, all I ever knew about love
is what I've seen of it...
around dance halls
and places like that.
But it can be entirely different...
altogether different.
Hey, what's the idea of these things?
If we run into trouble,
you'll find 'em mighty handy.
Trouble?
I'm not looking for trouble.
I mind my own business.
Why don't you change your mind
and go back with me? We can get horses...
- Drop the subject! I've had enough of you.
- You have, have you?
You're a crazy fool. I oughta hit you over
the head and drag you back to Tombstone.
Yeah? Maybe you'd like to try it.
If I tried it, I'd do it. You've buffaloed a lot
of people in your time...
- Earp, I've got a handkerchief here.
- Go ahead. Pull it.
Drop your reins
and get off the box!
- It's Curly Bill. He's piled rocks on the road.
- Well, turn around.
We'll hold them off
while you're doing it.
Come on!
Grab the reins!
Well, that takes care of Carter.
- Hey, Doc, you hurt bad?
- No, it's nothing. Just my left arm.
Come on.
Move over and give me the reins.
They're coming back!
Something must have happened!
Yo!
Somebody get a doctor.
The doctor is gone to Bisbee.
I'll take care of him.
Better luck next time.
- Curly Bill?
- Yeah.
Ah. So this is Tombstone.
Boiling water.
Get me some boiling water.
Get it yourself.
I ain't takin' no orders from you.
Get me some boiling water.
You heard her, Jerry.
Better get some boiling water.
All right, Doc... for you.
It's not bad, John. No bone or arteries involved.
I'll put a dressing on it.
All right, Nurse.
It's your case.
Huh! Here, now you hold this...
and sit still till I get back.
How do you reckon Curly Bill found out
the stage was leavin' on Sunday?
- I got a pretty good idea.
- Yeah?
I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't know that...
You didn't know what?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
Kind of like old times for you.
Yes, like old times.
- Remember?
- I remember you driving
through a raging blizzard...
to deliver a baby
at the Wilsons's farm...
and then catching pneumonia
and nearly dying.
You know, you were
my very first real case, John.
I bit your thermometer in two.
Scared you nearly to death.
And left the hospital three weeks too soon
and... had to be nursed all over again.
Well, not a very good job of nursing.
Look at your patient now.
If you had obeyed your nurse,
you wouldn't be here now.
All right.
All right,
hurry up and get out of here.
Doc and me wants to be alone.
I won't need you anymore.
You won't need me anymore?
Say, you trying to run me out of here?
I'm telling you to leave.
Hear what she's saying, Doc?
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it.
This is a hospital for the moment.
- She's the nurse in charge. I think you better go.
- Hmph.
- I won't. And she can't make me.
- I think I can.
- I've had quite some experience with violent cases!
- Aah!
- Hey, what's the idea?
- She threw me out! She threw me out!
- Good. That's just where you belong: Out.
- Yeah? If you and that dame...
Listen, I've had enough of your nonsense.
You tipped off Carter about the stage.
- Who says so?
- Never mind who says so.
I got every reason to believe...
You've got every reason to believe.
Sure, you believe what you just wanna believe.
- You've been after me since you come here.
- Let's forget about the stage.
But I'm warning you. You keep away
from Halliday and behave yourself...
or I'm gonna
run you out of town.
Yeah?
- You and who?
- Come on, come on.
Get.
There. Comfortable?
No, and I won't be
until you leave Tombstone.
Let's not talk about that anymore.
You've tried your best
to drive me away.
You've lied. You've done everything.
But it's no use, John.
I'm staying. I like the town,
I like your friend the marshal...
I wish I could make you understand.
It's all so unfair to you.
- I won't be around long.
- Yes, you will.
Hmm! You're telling the doctor?
John, do you remember
in the hospital...
- when I read aloud to you from Julius Caesar?
- Yeah.
There was a line in the first act
that went something like this:
Cowards die many times
before their death,
the brave but once.
- I'm a coward?
- You've become one, John.
You're afraid of living,
and you're afraid of dying.
No, I'm not afraid of dying.
Yes, afraid of dying.
Oh, all this going around killing
and hoping to be killed isn't courage.
Well, that's just a cover for fear.
Why, you're frantic with fear.
You're not displaying any more courage
than a Malay who runs amok.
Ahh, I don't know what
you're talking about.
Well, maybe I'm not
making myself very clear.
But my idea of courage...
is taking what's coming to you...
without striking out
right and left like a wild man.
I believe in fighting, yes...
but fighting with
an orderly mind, hopefully.
Oh, words, just words.
Well, they're not just words, John.
If you'd forget guns and forget killings...
and learn to think calmly and kindly...
you'd get well.
That's the way
it's gonna stay... closed.
- By whose authority?
- Mine.
If you boys want Carter's body, you'll find it
just the other side of the pass.
You don't think you've heard
the last of this, do you?
- Yeah. I reckon Curly Bill's had
enough, for a while anyway.
- You better reckon again.
Curly'll get you
and Doc Halliday for this...
if he has to tear this camp
up by the roots.
And I'll be right here to help him.
You talk too much
for a fightin' man, Pringle.
Thanks, Doc.
Pablo! Pablo!
- Pablo! Pablo! Who done it?
- Somebody help!
- I'll take him.
- I'll kill him!
- You don't have to. It's been done.
- Oh!
Oh, my! Oh, senor!
- Clear that stuff off of the table!
- Please, senor!
Oh, my Pablo!
Oh, senor!
Bring some towels, quick!
He's bleedin' bad. Somebody get the doctor.
- He won't be back until morning.
- Can't anybody do something?
My Pablo, he die!
Oh, my Pablo!
- Yeah, wait a minute. I know.
- Si, senora. Please, pronto!
I'm sorry, Sarah, but...
Hey, you, you're needed.
Little Pablo's just been shot.
Come on, come on.
Senor, you think he'll be all right?
Huh? Pablito, mijo.!
- We all stand here. Anyone
can do nothing for my Pablo.
- Come on, boys.
- He's dying.
- Gangway. Make way.
Say, she's a nurse.
Maybe she can do something.
Here, put your fingers there. It'll check
the hemorrhage until the doctor comes.
The doctor's out of town.
Will someone get Dr. Halliday?
- By gosh, Doc is a doctor.
- That's right, but he's all stove up.
- Will someone please get Dr. Halliday?
- Yeah. I'll get him for ya.
Make way.
Oh. Come on, Doc.
You're wanted.
Here he is, Doc.
Now let go.
Take hold.
- It's a severed artery. There's nothing I can do.
- You've got to do something.
- You can't let the boy die...
- Under the most favorable conditions...
it's a delicate operation,
far beyond me.
- What can I do with one arm and no instruments?
- I'll get you some instruments.
- Do you know where the doctor lives?
- Yeah.
- Take me there quickly.
- Come on.
Doc, please, do something for my boy.
- My boy!
- Boil some water, lots of it.
- Si.
- Get me some basins and a
mirror from the girls' room...
- and all your clean towels.
- Right, Doc.
- Doctor not in.
- I know, you big cow. Get out of the way.
Quick, it's a matter of life or death.
Where does the doctor keep his instruments?
You know, instruments.
Cuchillos. Things he cuts with.
There's nothing here.
Doc's taken everything with him to Bisbee.
- Take this.
- What's the good of all this?
- Doc can't do anything with
no instruments, can he?
- I don't know.
- Come on. Get out of the way!
- No get out of way.
- But a little boy... muchacho's dying.
- Come on!
Get out of the way, ya big lug!
All right, now everybody stand back
and give me room, lots of it.
Get back, everybody.
- No scalpel.
- No...
- Have you got a razor?
- I got one in the office, Doc.
I'll get it.
In there too.
All right, Doctor.
You can wash up now.
Roll my sleeve up.
Stop shaking and brush
the doctor's hands.
Administer the ether.
Scrub up around my wrist.
Pull the lamp down, Earp.
Now take that mirror.
Hold it against the lamp and reflect
all the light you can down here.
Please, Doctor.
Razor, please.
Oh, l... Oh.! Dios.
Clamp.
New suture.
Tie.
Wipe his face.
Bandage.
- Doctor?
- He's got a chance now... a good chance.
All he needs is quiet and rest.
Better take him home on this table.
- Dr. Dorsen'll tell you what
to do when he gets back.
He's going to live.
He says my boy Pablo...
he's going to live.
Dry them.
I'm so happy, you know?
Come, John.
You better get some rest.
- John?
- Yes, Sarah?
- Isn't it more thrilling to give
life than to take it away?
- Yes.
Doc!
All right, Wyatt Earp.!
I got your friend Doc Halliday, and you're next.!
We'll wait for ya
at the O.K. Corral.
And we won't wait long.!
Come and make your fight...
or get out of town, pronto!
Doc. Doc!
Oh, what have they done?
Oh, they've killed him!
They've killed him!
- Joe, give me my shotgun.
- I'll swear in a posse. We'll wipe 'em out.
No, Henderson.
This is my fight. I'll handle it.
Hold it a second.
Frank, lend me your six-gun.
Sorry you can't come along, Doc.
I'm going to take you
dead or alive, Curly.
You and your friends better
come out and surrender peacefully.
All right, you four-flusher.
If you want me, come and get me.
Well, Mr. Marshal, are you coming in,
or do we have to go out and get you?
Drop that gun, Curly.
Come here.
Turn around.
I'm gonna try to take you alive
if your friends'll let me. Get going.
You men drop your guns
and come out.
I got him for you, Doc!
I got him!
The stage is ready to go.
I'll put your baggage aboard.
No, wait.
I've changed my mind. I'm not going.
- You're not going?
- No.
You see, John meant a lot to me...
everything.
And just being near where he was
makes me feel I'm still close to him.
I understand.
- I'll tell 'em you're not going.
- Thank you.
Don't wait for Miss Allen.
She's not going.
- Are you leaving town, Jerry?
- Yeah, this dump's getting too tame for me. Look.
When people start saving their money,
it's time for me to vamoose.
Well, good-bye, Jerry,
and good luck.
Thanks. Well, I guess
you must be all right.
If you wasn't, a great fella like Doc
wouldn't have liked you.
So long.
Pull!
Good-bye, Doc.
