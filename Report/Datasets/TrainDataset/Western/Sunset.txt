Take her off!
Giddap!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
Tom!
Cut!
- I said cut.
- That was great.
Okay, that's lunch. Half an hour.
- Hi, Tom.
- Alfie.
- Hello, Tom.
- Miss Victoria.
- You look mighty pretty today.
- Thanks. So do you.
Let's go for a walk, Tom.
Randy, bring a couple chairs.
The film's looking very good.
Afraid we may have
another big hit on our hands.
- You came here to tell me that?
- No.
- How are you, Mr. Alperin?
- I didn't think so.
I just bought a sensational
script called Lawman.
About a famous frontier marshal,
Wyatt Earp.
Yeah, I heard of him.
"Alperin Films presents Tom Mix,
Hollywood's cowboy...
...starring as Wyatt Earp,
the West's famous lawman."
- I'll get Earp as technical advisor.
- Now hold on!
I didn't become numero uno at the
box office by playing other people.
Tom, this is a very
important project to me.
Fox and Chaplin are gambling on sound.
I'm betting my bankroll
on you in Lawman.
What if I don't agree?
Fact is, I'll be very unappy.
And you'll have to sit out
your contract.
Whers it up? March '33?
That's four years.
What are we saying?
You havert read the script yet.
I may be wrong,
but I'm sure you'll love it.
Well, I'll read it.
I'll let you know in the morning.
Fine.
I wanna start shooting next month.
I still have to talk
to the famous marshal.
All right, let's get back to work.
It should be educational,
working with a real gunfighter.
Maybe he'll give you some pointers.
Yeah, I bet he will.
You've got the wrong end
of the horse.
Depends on how you look at it.
If you was Tony Jr. Here, you'd think
you got the wrong end of Tom Mix.
Here comes Alfie.
- Bye, Alfie.
- Bye.
- Did he say yes?
- No, but he will.
Where's he going?
- It's been a pleasure, Mr. Earp.
- Feeling's mutual, George.
- Mr. Wyatt Earp?
- That's right. Tom Mix, isn't it?
That's right.
Can I give you a lift into town?
On your horse?
No, Tony Jr. Ain't got
no license plates.
I'm afraid you'll have to ride
in the Duesenberg.
There's a press conference at 2:00.
At 3:30, you meet with Mr. Alperin.
At 4, we have a photo session.
Will he have enough time to get
to the radio station by 5:30?
If we finish the photos by 4:45.
Do you have clothes that look Western?
We'll get something in wardrobe.
You look a like a Texas oil man
instead of a sheriff.
- A marshal.
- Marshal. What's the difference?
Hey, here they come!
Would you ever consider acting?
Excuse me.
I'm not gonna like staying here.
Then let's find you a place
where you will like staying.
Will Alperin be disappointed
if I don't show up for those things?
Yeah. That worry you?
I hired on as an advisor,
not a celebrity.
Well, that's it.
I lived here before I got famous.
Quiet. Private.
- Washed my socks in the sink.
- Think you can get me in?
Sure, I own it.
Mi casa es su casa.
- You learn Spanish in Cuba?
- You knew I was in Cuba?
I read about it in the Sunday paper.
- Lf it's in print, it's gotta be true.
- Absolutely.
In the Chicago Tribune
they said you were in the Boer War.
- Any photos?
- No, just sketches and engravings.
Engravings? Isn't that how
counterfeiters make funny money?
Cue the Earps.
- Dialogue!
- You're under arrest.
Don't kill me!
I ain't shooting!
The fight's commenced.
Get to fighting or get out.
Dialogue, Billy.
God, forgive me for all
the bad things I've done.
Cut!
- We'll do the close- ups after lunch.
- All right, that's lunch.
- Was it okay?
- Okay for me.
- Was that really just like it?
- Just like it.
I want to get Tom's close- ups first.
Tom, that was interesting.
- Suggestions?
- No. You handle a six-gun pretty good.
- Praise from Caesar.
- Can you hit anything?
You gotta hit what you shoot at.
I just gotta look good.
Was that really the way it was?
- Absolutely. Give or take a lie or two.
- Mr. Earp.
Good morning, Miss Shoemaker.
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
Honey, I'm gonna propose.
If you don't do publicity,
I'll lose my job.
I don't want that to happen.
I'll work it out with Mr. Alperin.
I know Alfie. He won't talk
until he gets his pound of flesh.
Do you mind if I try anyway?
- Okay, Mr. Earp.
- Would you mind making that Wyatt?
Sure, if you make it Nancy.
You warm an old mars heart, Nancy.
Shame on you, Wyatt, trying to pull
that old man stuff on me.
Mr. Earp?
Chief Dibner wants to see you.
- Who?
- Chief of security. I'll take you.
No need.
Just point me in the direction.
Go down Main Street.
Last bungalow on the left.
- Sounds easy. Thanks, officer.
- You're welcome.
Hey, Wyatt.
- Where you headed?
- Chief Dibner wants me.
Hold on a minute.
- Make him come to you.
- Why?
Because he's a dangerous
son of a bitch.
You know what they say about
bearding a lion in his den.
Sometimes the same thing applies
to dangerous sons of bitches.
You could've made a hell of an actor.
Marshalling and acting
arert too far apart.
One time, I wasrt packing my six-gun,
and Doc Holliday was drunk.
He was roaring he was gonna
shoot my earlobes off.
I went for a hideout gun.
Luckily, he thought I had one.
- Is that the truth?
- Oh, every word.
Give or take a lie or two.
Watch yourself, amigo.
It's just a Western.
Some Indians die, big deal.
- Watch your step.
- Michael, please!
Hold on.
Excuse me, but you're in the way
of some very dedicated drinking.
Well, I'm sorry.
Hey! What picture are you in?
I'm not.
- Well, then who are you?
- Name's Earp.
Wyatt Earp?
Well, I'm Billy the Kid,
and she's Calamity Jane.
Mary Jane Canary was a dear woman,
but she looked like an unmade bed.
- This young lady's much too pretty.
- Thank you, Mr. Earp.
Mr. Earp is here.
I'm Marvin Dibner.
Well, have a seat.
Apparently, Mrs. Alperin knows
you're here in Hollywood.
Mrs. Alperin would like you
to pay a call on her as a favour.
You know who she is?
Did you ever meet her?
- You don't say much, do you, Wyatt?
- No, I don't.
Also, it's Mr. Earp.
Or Marshal, or even Earp.
Not Wyatt until I tell you.
And while I think of it...
...don't ever question me again.
Just trying to be friendly.
You're trying to stay
ahead of the game.
Your boss's wife wants to talk to me,
you want to know why.
Probably your boss does too.
My job is to get curious about
anything involving Mrs. Alperin.
- You know what she wants?
- Why not ask Mrs. Alperin?
What's bothering you?
Your bad manners and the fact
you don't hear too good.
I told you not to try questioning me.
And I meant it.
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Mr. Earp.
- Can I help you?
- With what?
First off, don't ever crowd anybody
unless you got a first-class reason.
Did you do a lot of time, boy?
- Where?
- Folsom.
For what?
Armed robbery.
Make a move, it'll be
the mistake of your life.
- Am I clear?
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes, sir?
- Marshal Earp to see Mrs. Alperin.
If you'll follow me.
I'll inform Mrs. Alperin
that you're here.
Not much like Denver.
Mr. Earp, thank you for coming.
- I've hoped to see you again.
- I wanted to hear from you.
It wouldn't have been fitting.
I didn't think you'd remember.
You've never been forgotten.
You are just as I remember.
Perhaps taller.
- Is it possible that you grew?
- Not likely.
Then there can only be
one explanation.
I was wearing high heels.
You were. Soft, gray kid
high-button shoes.
- How could you remember?
- I undid them.
- The buttons were yellow ivory.
- Whalebone.
That night in Denver,
you said...
That if you were ever in trouble,
I'd come.
Let's go outside where we won't
be interrupted.
Alfie told me you were here,
and everyone else is afraid.
- Afraid?
- Of each other. Of...
Of your husband?
Yes, I suppose so.
They're afraid Alfie might not
want me helped.
With your son?
I met him today at the studio.
- Was he...?
- Drinking? Yes.
I received a letter from a woman
I used to know named Candace Girard.
She runs a place
called the Candy Store.
She says Michael hurt one of her girls
and I suggests I buy her off.
- What was the girl's name?
- Rhonda Lopez. Please see her.
I've no one to turn to.
I'll pay anything.
I'm not for hire. I'll do it
for the way you held the roses.
Christina Alperirs a very lovely lady
who married the wrong man.
Easy to understand.
When she met Alfie...
...he didn't want
to take over the world.
He was still "The Happy Hobo"
that people laughed at and loved.
I'm here to tell you, Wyatt,
when he wanted to be...
...he could be the most charming,
considerate...
...giving, funny man.
Especially when he wanted something.
He sure did want Christina.
Arert you hot?
It's open.
- The press awaits.
- Better get her done, pardner.
I explained that you have pressing
engagements and must be done by 6:30.
- How did you know that?
- I didn't.
Tom's taking me on a tour.
Starting with Graumars Chinese
and ending up at the Candy Store.
- Good evening, Mr. Mix.
- Cheryl.
Allow me to introduce Mr. Wyatt Earp.
- The real Wyatt Earp?
- Yes, I'm not dead yet.
I can see that.
Promise not to close us down
like the saloons in Tombstone.
- I never closed a saloon in my life.
- Good.
- We know what Tom drinks.
- I'll have...
No, let me guess.
A Waterfill and Frazier...
...and a cold Dos Equis to chase.
Close enough.
- How long do you plan to be in town?
- As long as I find it interesting.
- We'll do what we can to keep you.
- I think that'd be nice.
- Cheryl.
- Miss Alperin.
Victoria Alperin,
Alfie's kid sister, and...
Dutch Kieffer.
I'm surprised a marshal
knows the Chicago underworld.
East or West, a crook is a crook.
Did Tom tell you that our ladies
all look like famous movie stars?
Greta? This is Mr. Wyatt Earp.
- It's a pleasure, Mr. Earp.
- My pleasure, Ms. Garbo.
Amazing resemblance.
Yes, and besides Greta,
we have Janet Gaynor, Pola Negri...
...and the Gish sisters.
I forget you're here on business.
Mrs. Alperin wanted me to talk
to Candace Girard.
I see. About the girl
that Michael beat up?
Yes.
You'll find Candace
in the guest cottage.
That's where she lives
and sometimes entertains.
Use the back door.
Tom knows the way.
Will you be here when I get back?
Depends on when you get back.
How you doing, pal?
Hiya, big boy.
Honeysuckle.
- You arert what I expected you to be.
- What exactly did you expect?
I don't know, exactly.
A little less civilized.
You're not exactly what
I expected you to be, either.
What exactly did you expect I'd be?
Taller, maybe.
Candy! It's Tom Mix, honey.
Candy!
- Cadillac Eight.
- Recognize it?
No.
I got a lousy feeling about this.
Yeah, I got the same lousy feeling.
Candy!
Candy?
Oh, shit.
- Michael Alperin.
- Yeah, we met. Get the car.
Candy! Open up, it's important.
- It's a raid.
- Where's the car?
- Killed her!
- What's going on?
- What happened?
- Don't go in there!
- No! No!
- Cheryl, come on! Cheryl!
Tom! Get your hat and close this door!
- Cheryl! Shut up!
- No!
Cheryl! Listen to me!
Listen to me! Listen!
Get down! Get down!
Pull yourself together.
Go in there and keep your mouth shut.
Come on, Tom!
- I didn't know you could drive.
- I can't.
Hey, look out!
Close that door, honey.
- Get him undressed.
- Will you tell...?
Candy Girard was murdered.
They're looking for Michael.
We gotta keep him here.
- He did it?
- I don't think so.
- I killed her.
- He disagrees.
He's drugged.
- You mean drunk.
- That too. He's gonna be sick again.
Towels!
- You sure about her?
- Real sure.
- That's sure enough for me.
- Honey, come on.
Wait, wait.
- We gotta go. Can you handle this?
- Sure, I'll just pretend he's my ex.
- It's gonna be a couple of days.
- I'll manage. I'll call in sick.
I'll call you as soon as I get home.
Tom, come on.
- What if he decides to leave?
- Where is he going without his pants?
I killed her.
God, I hope you're lying.
Wyatt.
I'm okay.
I'm all right.
Will you sleep with me?
I'm old enough to be your father.
You're old enough to be my grandfather.
Now answer the question.
Yes.
I just need to be held.
At one time or another, we all do.
- Why did you tell Cheryl where I was?
- She asked me.
I figured if she asked,
you'd tell her.
- Was I wrong?
- Nope.
Grand girl.
A grand 26-year-old girl.
Could've done myself permanent injury.
- How many men you killed?
- How many cars you got?
- About 16.
- You got more cars.
Mr. Mix!
Captain Dibner wants you and Mr. Earp
to report to his office.
Mr. Mix and Mr. Earp.
Wyatt Earp, Captain Blackwon'th, P.D.
Tom, you know him.
Have a seat.
You boys were at the Candy Store
last night.
- Was we?
- Guess we was.
Candace Girard was killed
shortly before you left.
- Did you know that, Wyatt?
- Yeah.
- Dib, you got a drink?
- Yes, sir.
I'm a tequila man.
Waterfill and Frazier.
You saw a girl. Cheryl.
Gotta hand it to you.
You sure are up on things.
We need to talk to her.
She was...
...close with Candy.
Real close.
Maybe you'd talk at headquarters.
So far, you've been telling us things.
Ask questions, you'll get answers.
What do you know about Candy's murder?
Very little.
Practically nothing.
No idea who killed her?
- Could be the man in the black Cadillac.
- What black Cadillac?
The one that drove out of the alley.
- Licence number.
- I forget.
Yeah, I forget too.
Well, if I was you,
I'd damn well try to remember.
You'd have trouble remembering
when you get pushed hard.
Let me give you an example.
Why did you raid the Candy Store?
It was engaged in the practice
of prostitution.
That's illegal here.
Come on, captain.
Candy's been around a long time.
It's a gold mine.
To stay open, she had to be
paying someone a lot of juice.
I don't know. That's not
my department, that's vice.
Well, there you go.
That's the way it is in the big city.
Everybody's in another department.
All nice and legal.
Tell me, captain. With all those
different departments...
...have you got a department that
looks into crooked cops on the take?
See?
Sometimes you get pushed too hard...
...you got a tendency to forget.
Afternoon, Dib.
You're not gonna let him
get away with that?
No.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know...
...but I'm gonna love it.
Get out of town, Earp.
- Smile when you say that, pardner.
- Oh, yeah?
Cut! That was great.
How'd you like it?
It was real thrilling...
...but I've never been
in a fight like that.
- And Buffalo Bill didn't kill Injuns.
- You're right.
Bill was good, but not as good
as his publicity.
Like a movie star cowboy I know.
I get the feeling you're not
comfortable being a famous movie star.
What if I told you when Roosevelt
was charging up San Juan Hill...
...I was in Muskogee busting broncs.
I'd say that you and I
are whole lot alike.
Part fact and just enough fiction
to sell newspapers.
Nobody's comfortable being anything.
I think the trick is to know the fact,
and don't believe the fiction.
Tell me about Blackwon'th.
Known as "Dirty Bernie."
Not a nice piece of work.
- I think he'd like to kill one of us.
- Which one?
Maybe both.
If it's me, I'm counting on you
to avenge me.
- Waterfill and Frazier?
- Oh, no. Too early.
Says you. This morning,
I need some help.
Do you know Rhonda Lopez?
- The girl Michael beat up?
- Alleged to have beat up.
Met her once or twice.
Can't say I know her.
- Tom!
- Where's Michael?
Gone. I tried to stop him
but he left.
- In his underwear?
- No, in your pajamas.
- What's that?
- Tequila.
You know I don't drink tequila.
He called a cab.
I tried to reach you.
- What cab company?
- Checkered, I think.
- Know where he went?
- No. Can you find out?
Maybe. We gotta be careful.
We don't want the cab company
calling the police.
What the hell did you run into?
Mr. Alperin wants Mr. Earp
to have lunch.
I'm sorry we couldn't meet sooner.
I've had meetings all week.
Twelve, sometimes 15 hours a day.
Couldrt even have lunch till now.
You must enjoy your work.
Most of the time
it's a real challenge.
Keeps me on my toes. Keeps me young.
- Have you seen any of my pictures?
- A few.
My biggest problem
is staying in shape.
Not like it was when I was an acrobat.
These days I have to steal time
just to work out.
I've found that a strong,
agile, average man...
...can nearly always beat a strong,
clumsy, big man.
Now, you take, for example, Arthur.
Remember Arthur, who was unsuccessful
in preventing you from seeing my wife.
Please, don't misunderstand me.
I'm not opposed to you seeing my wife.
I'm opposed to people not doing their
jobs. It was Arthur's job to stop you.
Even if he knew I was expected?
But he didn't. That's the point.
So the strong, agile, average man...
...showed the strong, big, clumsy man.
The error of his ways. Exactly.
- He must love his job.
- He has no choice.
He's on parole to me.
There is nothing more important than
the welfare and safety of my family.
Which brings us to the reason
that you saw my wife.
- She asked you to help Michael.
- Did she tell you that?
I've been told the police suspect
that he murdered Candace.
If you really want to help,
get him to turn himself in.
I'll try.
Good.
Where is he?
Why would I know?
You were at the Candy Store.
I presumed you helped him.
To hide, to get away?
If he did kill Candace Girard,
that would make me an accessory.
I did see another
member of your family.
Your sister Victoria
on the arm of Dutch Kieffer.
What is it that you want?
To do whatever I can
to help Christina.
Why?
Because she asked.
That's okay, we've gotta go anyway.
How are you?
- Call me.
- And me too.
I got a favour to ask you.
I want you to tell Dirty Bernie
to lay off Wyatt.
He won't listen.
You don't want Earp to blow down
Alfie's house of cards.
Expose him for what he is.
- Just how would he do that?
- Wanna find out?
Turn down my favour.
Pick your ass up out of the chair.
You'll find out.
Go ahead, Marvin.
Take that chance.
- I'll see what I can do.
- Not good enough.
Either do it or don't.
Get it?
Have a nice day, Dib.
How was your lunch?
The man is crazy.
Underneath all that happy lovability
and charm is a brutal sadist.
- How come nobody spotted it?
- It's been spotted.
Nobody's proven it...
...although it's a topic of
conversation in the industry.
I've got some bad news.
Michael has been
arrested and booked...
...for the murder of Candace Girard.
They'll locate the cab driver
who picked him up.
- Lf they tie you in, you're in danger.
- We gotta get you out of town.
- Go to the ranch.
- And don't go home.
Let me borrow your car.
What's the next move?
- What?
- He don't know how to drive.
This time I gotta stop you.
Tell him to go to hell.
I'll talk to the parole board.
- They'll listen to him.
- He's worse.
- Nothing's worse.
- I gotta see her.
Mr. Earp, please come in.
I'll explain to Mr. Alperin.
Tell your boss I pulled a gun on you.
Tom called.
He said you were on your way.
- Tell me about Michael.
- You all right?
- Did he do it, Wyatt?
- I don't think so.
- Will you help him?
- I'll try.
There's something else.
It's not just Michael.
- What is it, Christina?
- Please!
If I knew you were coming to see
Christina I'd have given you a ride.
I asked him to come by.
Saved you the trouble of
pulling that gun on Arthur.
Darling, shouldn't you be in bed?
I'm much better.
Christina took a nasty fall.
Luckily no bones broken, huh?
The doctor recommended that she
stay in bed for the next few days.
I know how worried you are.
You've simply got to take more
care of yourself.
Now, go on.
Back to bed.
I'm sure Mr. Earp will understand.
Thank you, Mr. Earp.
I'll be up shortly.
You know, Mr. Earp...
I considered you a good investment...
...but lately you've become
more trouble than you're won'th.
If anything happens to Christina...
...you're gonna have to come up with
a new definition of trouble.
What am I gonna do for clothes?
We'll get you the clothes you need.
Asunciòn will get you what you need.
- Asunciòn?
- The housekeeper.
- Don't leave, you understand?
- I do.
- This is serious.
- Okay.
Get in.
- Filled with gas?
- Yes.
Check to make sure
nobody's following you.
This baby could outrun
anything on four wheels.
It's hard being in competition
with a horse and 16 cars.
I'd rather be with you than any car.
What about your horse?
- Don't answer that.
- Get her going, George.
- What are you gonna do without me?
- Whatever I can.
Bye.
Candy's my mother.
She thought I looked cute
and provocative in mers clothing.
She knew people would
assume we were lovers.
And...
And I wouldn't have to entertain.
I expect that's why Dirty Bernie's
looking for me.
It's Candy's customers.
Various notations on their
lifestyles and preferences.
Who is "Hellman, Robert"?
The mayor.
Enough in here to get a lot of
important people in a lot of trouble.
You knew about most of these things?
Yes.
According to this,
Michael's a lot like his father.
No, not really.
Michael's basically passive
unless he drinks.
But, Alfie...
He enjoys hurting people.
There are some interesting things...
...about Dutch Kieffer and Victoria.
Yeah.
She likes women, and he likes to watch.
You're a long way
from Tombstone, marshal.
Where can I find Dutch Kieffer?
We//, you cou/d try the Kit Kat C/ub.
- There you go.
- Thank you very much, sir.
Hi, Tom.
May I take your hat?
Who the hell let you in?
Ladies.
- The door was open.
- There's a doorbell.
I rang it.
- Nobody answered.
- You could've knocked.
How well did you know Candy Girard?
What the hell business
is it of yours?
You may not like this, Victoria...
...but I'm making it my business.
My houseman was the Australian
light heavyweight boxing champion.
He'll kick your ass
all the way to Pasadena.
- Well, in the meantime...
- There is no "in the meantime."
You were there the night
she was murdered.
So were you.
So were a lot of people.
So what?
You think your nephew killed her?
How the hell do I know?
In case you hadrt noticed,
Michael's a serious lush.
When he's drunk,
he's been known to beat up women.
Maybe that's what happened with Candy.
Maybe he lost control and killed her.
Maybe.
As anybody could see,
you're all broken up about it.
Son of a bitch!
Somebody with a real bad temper
killed Candy.
Hurt him. Really hurt him.
I recognize you.
You're Tom Mix, the movie star.
I hear you've
sparred with Jack Dempsey.
Come on, mate.
Let's see what you've learned.
- Marquis of Queensberry?
- Yeah, okay. Marquis of Queensberry.
I gotta go look.
- Come on!
- Smash his face in!
Damn you!
Son of a bitch!
- Marquis of Queensberry?
- Yeah.
Compliments of Mr. Jack Dempsey.
Ladies.
You wait till I tell my brother!
You'll never work in this town again!
The guy is still out cold.
You sure?
Well, I kicked him.
He didn't seem to mind.
He knows it was your Cadillac.
He knows you were at the Candy Store
the night Candy was killed.
You better figure out
what to do with him.
I know what.
I just havert decided how.
I'll be home.
When you're finished,
call the station.
Get the car and then give us a hand.
There's no "us." I'm out of this.
You just give advice, huh?
In this case, right.
In this case, wrong.
You're in this up to your badge.
You stop playing, you're gonna
end up in somebody's meat locker.
- You can't intimidate me, Dutch.
- The fuck, I can't.
- You have a cat?
- Not that big.
Trespassing. Assault.
- That can get you hard time.
- Not if I shoot the witnesses.
I doubt you will.
You had me whipped and tied
like a calf ready to be branded.
Yeah, I did that.
You broke in. I don't know you.
I know who you are, Dutch.
If I was some unknown trespasser...
...you'd have called the police
instead of tying me up and leaving me.
That's Captain Blackwon'th.
I know who he is.
Then do what you gotta do.
I'm gonna call your bluff and walk.
When Captain Blackwon'th recovers...
...I want you to persuade him to
lay off Cheryl.
- I don't have that kind of influence.
- I think you do.
Anyway, you try.
Because if Cheryl has any trouble
with Blackwon'th, or you, or anybody...
...the DA is gonna get
a certain black book.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
- You're wasting time again.
- I don't know about any black book.
Drop it!
I'll kill you.
Now, about that, I have influence.
If he doesrt drop it by the time
I count three...
...you kill him.
One.
Two.
Now, what I got here is
a 12-gauge, full-choke shotgun.
Go ahead and count three.
Let's see who gets killed first.
Your call.
Okay, I've made my point.
You can take it or leave it.
- Sorry we're on opposite sides.
- Well, that's usually the case.
And if you touch me again,
I'll kill you.
Likewise, Mr. Earp.
In an actor's world,
things arert what they seem.
A pauper is a prince...
...or a shotgun is a mop.
- You'll have to give this up.
- Why?
- You're gonna get yourself killed.
- People have said that for 50 years.
Can we go someplace quiet to talk?
Sure.
Hey, Mix!
Come on! Ho/a, Maria Chiquita.
- We dance later, okay, baby?
- Sure, baby.
Tom Mix.
I don't give a damn who he is!
He broke in, he wrecked the place
and he insulted me!
I want his damn legs broken!
He practically accused me
of killing Candy!
Look, shut up.
Did you hear what I said?
All right, I heard you.
Jesus.
- Hello.
- I'm at El Coyote.
Mix just came in with Earp
and the girl.
There are a couple stunt riders here
that think Mix is a phony.
If the price is right
they might prove it.
Let me know what happens later.
Right.
Well, are you going to take care
of Mix or do I have to tell Dutch?
What I do is my business.
- You're not gonna tell Dutch anything.
- The hell I'm not.
Except what I want you to tell him.
Otherwise, you're gonna have
two gimpy legs, little sister.
You're gonna go home.
You're gonna call the cops.
Tell them that Tom Mix beat you up,
then raped you.
They'll never believe me.
They'll believe you.
I want you to cry a lot...
...and show them the bruises.
Alfie!
And they'll believe you.
Bravo!
Ride her, pardner.
Bravo!
Where did you learn
to dance like that?
I fell in love with a lady
from Buenos Aires who believed...
...a man wasrt a lover
unless he tangoed.
- Not much choice.
- I took lessons.
What was this lady's vocation?
Tango instructor.
- Is that the truth?
- Hundred percent.
Give or take a lie or two.
- To honest men.
- And brave women.
And friendships, tried and true.
Hello, boys.
We saw your wagon and thought
we'd tell you right to your face.
- Tell me what?
- You're a half-breed candy ass.
Not exactly a hot bulletin.
That's why we hire fearless stuntmen
like yourselves.
Mosey to the bar
and buy a drink on me.
- We don't want a drink on you.
- We'll buy her a round.
How about it? You want to have
a drink with real men...
...instead of a half-breed candy ass
and his granddaddy?
Before you make two big fools
of yourselves...
...I suggest you look under the table.
Do what?
I'd do what he says. This here's
Wyatt Earp, famous lawman...
...known to carry a pistol that he may
have snuck out as you picked a fight.
Yeah, right. I know who he is.
He didn't come in packing no hog leg.
- I thought you were looking at my car.
- We wasrt.
Earp or no Earp...
...I bet you don't have a gun
under the table.
It's your funeral.
- I'm going to kill you!
- One move and I'll pig-stick you!
Now, take my advice and run,
while you still have your cojones.
Hey, Mix, baby!
Hello, Tom.
Let's take a walk, Dib.
Excuse me, darling.
Me and Marvin got important
business to discuss.
- What the hell...?
- Walk!
- What did I do?
- Can it.
You set me up with those stuntmen.
- Tom, l...
- You listen to me, you lying shit.
I asked you for a favour.
Now I'm telling you.
Get Alfie to lay off Wyatt
or the next time this happens...
...l'll drag you down Sunset.
Ain't gonna be enough hide on you
to patch a pinole.
Just counselling the chief.
I'm a little more civilized than him,
and I want to get my two cents in.
Give me trouble, I'll kill you,
understand?
- Yes.
- Say it. Convince me.
- Any more trouble, you'll kill me.
- I believe you.
So from now on,
whether you live or die is up to you.
Excuse me.
Can I go to the bathroom?
We gotta get something straight.
I threatened to drag him
and you threatened to kill him.
- I don't like being out-threatened.
- Wort happen again.
Bad as being upstaged.
I'm a movie star.
Why are you here?
You don't come here.
We had an agreement.
Had an agreement.
What's that supposed to mean?
Any agreement didn't include
you beating Victoria.
What? What do you...?
- Did Victoria tell you that?
- She did.
She fingered Mix,
but I know what really happened.
And how do you know?
A year ago we made a deal.
I don't deal with anyone
I don't know everything about.
I know who and what you are.
I knew a guy like you
when I was starting. Cocky guy.
Wore spats and a derby.
He used to brag about how smart he was.
Till someone shot him in the mouth.
If Mix is arrested,
what happens to his movie?
I'll close down for a few days.
We'll recast.
Tom Mix will be washed up.
Provided he's found guilty.
The press will find him guilty.
Blackwon'th's arresting Mix is okay.
But not until I get
Candy's little black book.
- How will you do that?
- Nancy Shoemaker.
Mix is hiding her up at his ranch.
A woman called, but wouldn't
leave her name. She sounded disturbed.
- You didn't recognize the voice?
- It was English.
She asked if you could be reached.
I'll get it.
Hello.
- Tom.
- Yes?
This is Christina.
Dutch Kieffer knows you've got Nancy
up at the ranch...
Strap on your iron, we're saving Nancy.
This here is my flying buddy!
- Wyatt, Cheryl!
- Hi!
What about the funeral?
If you're not back,
take Cheryl to the funeral!
Come on, Wyatt! We gotta go!
- You ever done any flying?
- Nope!
Me neither!
- It's still dark!
- It'll be dawn in 10 minutes!
Fasten your seat belt!
How much further?
About 50 miles.
Oh, shit!
What do you think you're doing?
Mostly trying to stay alive.
Hey, I know you.
- Ain't you...?
- Yeah.
That's Tom Mix.
Wyatt, I want you to meet...
What are your names?
- This is Henry.
- And this is Fred.
I want you to meet Wyatt Earp.
- Wyatt?
- Earp?
Morning, boys.
- Where are we?
- Now you're on the Circle C.
About 15 miles southeast
of your spread.
We sure would appreciate the loan
of a couple fast horses.
I'm getting to where I can't
even stay on a horse.
Go on!
Hey, what do you want?
What do you want?
Let go of me, you big bastard!
- You'll be all right?
- I'd feel better if they was a camera.
Let's get her done.
Get in the car!
Get in there and shut up!
Spread out!
Get off me!
My God!
Wyatt.
Well, you done good, pardner.
Of course, a couple more inches...
To assure the resurrection
to eternal life...
...through the Lord, Jesus Christ...
...we commend thee, Almighty God,
our sister, Candace Girard.
We commit her to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Bless you, my child.
Cheryl King?
Yes.
I would've given you this sooner,
but I couldn't find you.
My card.
If you need help, please call.
I'm sorry.
- A man gave me this envelope.
- Open it.
You know a Leo Vogel, attorney?
No.
It's a safety deposit box key.
I'm glad you boys finally showed up.
What are you doing here, Blackwon'th?
I'm about to arrest America's
favourite star cowboy...
...for felonious assault and rape.
Unless you try to stop me.
And I hope you do.
Rape?
You're kidding. Who did I rape?
You'll find out about
that at the station.
Let's go.
I'm primed.
You wanna take him?
I'd like to, but he's not won'th it.
You bit off more than you can chew.
Call my lawyer, Saul Rosenstein.
I'll be all right, honey.
You go with them.
I'd run you and your
lesbo girlfriend out of town...
...but you made some
dangerous enemies here.
I'm looking forward to what's
gonna happen when they catch you.
How's your nose?
Get out of here,
before I forget I'm a lawman.
I don't think you
killed half those men.
And the ones you did kill,
I bet you shot them in the back.
Let's find out, you son of a bitch.
Draw.
My men will cut you to ribbons.
Not before I shoot out your eyes.
Another time.
- Would you have killed him?
- No.
Why?
I'm not packing a gun.
- Hey, ain't you Tom Mix?
- I sure am, pardner.
Tom, you need a new sidekick?
- Can I get you anything?
- I don't expect to be here long.
Don't count on it.
- Hello, Michael. How are you, boy?
- Not very well.
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- Yes, I was framed.
Who'd do that?
Whoever got the bartender to drug me,
then had me go to Candy's.
- And you found her dead.
- No.
She said, "Never trust an Alperin,"
then she died.
She was trying to name the killer. She
just didn't have time to be specific.
You can take your pick, though.
I mean, there are four Alperins.
Well, three, if my mother
decides to narrow the field.
What do you mean?
You didn't hear?
She's in the hospital.
She's not expected to live.
How much do you think there is?
Maybe this'll help.
"Hi, baby.
The man who gave you this
key is an old friend...
...and a good lawyer.
If you need any help or advice after
you read this, give him a call.
They say that confession
is good for the soul...
...so here goes.
On August 11 th, 1916...
...I was a guest aboard
Alfie Alperirs yacht...
...which was returning from Catalina.
I witnessed Alfie Alperin fighting
with his first wife.
Then he hit her,
and pushed her overboard.
When he saw me...
...I was sure he was going to kill me.
Instead...
...he led me to his cabin,
where he beat me...
...and raped me.
Afterwards, he said that if I kept
my mouth shut...
...he would set me up in business.
Now, baby, I want you to give this...
...give this letter
to the district attorney.
It will protect you."
It's an exciting evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
We expect a gala turnout tonight
of major stars.
Arriving now is Mr. Alfie Alperin.
No statement right now, okay?
The press conference is all set.
Any other news?
What's wrong?
Mix and Wyatt are at the hospital.
Can they hurt you?
I better get dressed.
So silly, losing my balance
and falling over like that.
Is that you, Tom?
Yes, Christina.
I saw Michael. He sends his love.
- He didn't kill that girl, did he?
- No.
No, I'm sure Alfie killed her,
just like I'm sure he did this to you.
Why do you protect him?
Because...
...he's not Michael's father.
He promised me that if I married him,
he'd raise Michael as his own son.
I guess for a while he even tried.
But the thought of another man...
Then, when the doctor
told him that we...
That he couldn't have children...
...he grew to hate Michael.
I did everything I could
to protect him.
What about Michael's real father?
He never knew.
I don't seem to have had much luck
with my men, have I, Wyatt?
I'm so tired.
Try to rest.
He'll never bother you again, my dear.
Welcome to the first annual
Academy Awards.
Before we start handing out
our little statuettes...
...I wanna introduce
an entrepreneur...
...a brilliant clown who retired his
tuxedo coat and baggy pants...
...and is now one of Hollywood's
most successful producers.
Known by millions of his adoring fans
as "The Happy Hobo":
Mr. Alfie Alperin.
- Landmark in Hollywood history.
Arriving now, we can see Tom Mix.
But who's that he's got in the car
with him? It's Wyatt Earp!
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for remembering.
Congratulations
to all of us here today...
...for being here to celebrate this
most important event for our industry.
As some of you know...
...my dearest wife, Christina,
is seriously ill in the hospital.
So unfortunately, I'm gonna have to
leave before you honour the winners.
Let me just say this in parting:
Have fun, enjoy yourselves...
...and those who are
working at Alperin, my studio...
... especially the ladies,
don't stay up too late, all right?
Enjoy yourselves. God bless.
Have fun.
Alperin?
I'm taking you in.
How can you do that?
You're not the law here.
No, just a citizen making sure
a murderer doesrt escape.
I'll shoot if I have to.
You're insane.
This is Candace Girard's confession.
She saw you murder your first wife.
You're making a scene, Mr. Earp.
Walk with me to the stairs.
If I don't?
I killed Candy.
I've got nothing to lose.
- Victoria.
- Go on, Alfie.
Get out of here, Alfie.
Walk to the stairs.
You couldn't have beaten
Candace up like that.
You and Dutch find her
after Alfie got through with her?
- Finish her off with an ice pick?
- And I loved every minute of it.
Hold it right there, Earp.
Get your hands up.
Get away from him, Miss Alperin.
Dib, get his gun.
We got a report from Paso Robles.
Four men were killed at Mix's ranch.
- Yep.
- You admit you know about it?
Sure. I killed them. Well, two
of them. Tom got the other two.
- I arrest you for murder.
- Let's go.
Get back!
- What the hell?
- Interesting development.
- Get out of the way.
- He can't.
- What's this?
- Vickie.
- He can hurt Alfie. I won't let him.
- But not like this.
- We'll take care of him.
- She killed Candy.
Alfie has paid you a fortune.
- Just go down the stairs!
- There's too many witnesses.
- Miss Alperin...
- No!
- Victoria!
- No, Dutch. It's gone too far. Go away.
- Oh, Christ.
- You son of a bitch!
No! Dutch!
- Dutch, give me the gun.
- Tom, go get Alfie.
It hurts.
Why did you kill Candy?
She was gonna tell about
what happened on the boat.
I had to protect Alfie.
You don't understand, do you?
Sometimes...
...bad people like me and Alfie...
...only have each other.
Daddy. Daddy...
Go! Don't slow down for anything.
Get me to the boat as fast as you can.
- Did you hear about Mrs. Alperin?
- No.
It was on the radio. She died.
Just step on it!
I think we're being followed.
Come on. Can't you shake him?
Just get me to the boat quickly.
It's all I ask.
You stop this goon behind us...
...or you're gonna see the inside
of Folsom for a long time.
Do you hear me, Arthur?
Do you hear me?
Where are you going?
You passed the boat!
Hey! Son of a bitch! No! No! No!
No!
- Help! Help!
- Shit!
- I can't swim!
- Hang on, Arthur!
Help! Help!
Relax!
- You okay, Mr. Mix?
- I'm all right.
- What about Mr. Alperin?
- Better call the police.
Sorry.
You'd have drowned us both.
Better to drown.
They'll put me away for life!
- Think you can walk?
- Yeah.
Then why don't you start?
Keep walking till you find a place
you want to start a new life.
You mean it?
I'm the hero, Arthur.
I always mean what I say.
Thanks.
Por nada, amigo. Get going.
You know something, pardner?
You're developing a real knack
for upstaging me.
Some folks would rest
a whole lot easier if you burned this.
Or I could open up
the Candy Store again.
That you could.
Got a match?
All aboard!
Come back.
You never know.
Now you take care
of that big guy, will you?
- I'll miss you.
- And I'll miss you.
Michael.
I'll tell you like I told your mother
a long time ago.
If you ever need help,
you know where to find me.
Yes, sir.
All aboard!
So long, pardner.
Adiós, amigo.
