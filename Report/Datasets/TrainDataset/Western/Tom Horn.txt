- Morning.
- Morning. What do you want?
What do you want?
How much?
Twenty-four cents. Cash.
Don't put him in with any other horse,
would you?
Why not?
lt'd just be better.
That'll be extra.
Put him in with another horse,
he's gonna kill him.
That'll be extra for you.
What the hell else does he do?
He can spin in half his own length
in crossfire from either side.
If you drop a dime over in that stall,
don't stoop over to get it.
- Get it with your pitchfork.
- What do you keep him around for?
That's a mother-in-law horse.
Know what that is?
A mother-in-law horse is a horse
you put your mother-in-law on.
Send them both up in the hills
and hope they don't ever come back.
Here's your money.
He just all-around looks after
my best welfare.
I'm going out and get a morning whiskey.
If all goes wrong,
I'll come back and sleep in that stall.
What about your tack?
Just leave it in there.
Anybody that's brave enough...
to go in there and get it,
they're welcome to it.
- Harry, pass the champagne.
- Breakfast champagne in Hagersville.
Now, how can I pass the champagne
when Dexter here drank it all?
Barkeep, a little more champagne.
Soon as we get to San Francisco...
I want to check out
where Mahare is training.
Gonna be pretty tough.
I understand he's copying your style, Jim.
I'm not worried about him.
The last 10 guys he faced,
he knocked them out.
He's never seen Jim's footwork, either.
Remember that Florida fight? You were
so fast, he couldn't land a punch.
That new punch of yours
is the greatest in the game.
Tex, did you ever hear of a hook punch?
No, I haven't.
We're toasting the man
with the greatest hook punch in the world.
Barkeep, give Tex some champagne
so that he can toast with us.
- I'd rather have whiskey.
- Give him anything he wants.
Jim, you brought a touch of class
to this game.
And a lot of pretty ladies.
Tex, you ready?
What are we toasting?
We're toasting the next
heavyweight champion of the world:
"Gentleman Jim" Corbett.
He's gotta fight for it yet,
so he ain't champion.
Why don't we toast
something interesting?
Like what?
Like Geronimo there. He's interesting.
In a pig's ass. Don't you read the papers?
They put Geronimo in jail,
where he belongs.
Let me ask you something, Tex.
Who's Geronimo next to Jim Corbett?
Geronimo's a man so great...
that Corbett there'd have to stand
on his mother's shoulders to kiss his ass.
Frank.
- What's your name?
- Tom Horn.
Do you have a gun, Tom?
- No, I don't.
- Good.
Then you're gonna get
exactly what you deserve.
I don't know where you come from...
but the manners that you arrived with
are just awful.
I'm trying to imagine
how you could make such a reference...
to the mother of the future
heavyweight champion of the world.
You ain't champion yet.
Besides, you're acting like an asshole.
- I could go to the penitentiary over you.
- Now, wait a minute.
Before we start this fight,
I wanna ask you one question.
- Is it about my mother?
- No. I've said enough about her.
If I win this fight,
am I the champion of the world?
You're not big enough.
Then what are you picking on
a little fellow like me for?
You get in a fight in a public bar,
they'll discredit you from your profession.
I'm gonna save you from that.
That ain't the real Tom Horn, is it?
He doesn't seem to be
too scared of Corbett.
He's gonna get himself killed.
Lord, the end is here.
- Is Tom Horn in there?
- Yeah, he's here.
Last stall on the right.
But I wouldn't go in there
with that horse if I were you.
That son of a bitch is harebrained.
He's got him trained to stand people off.
Well, he's a hero of the frontier
and he's lying here in Hagersville...
with his face kicked in.
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
How bad you hurt?
Wasn't much of a party.
Say, you another one
of those newspaper guys?
No, I ain't, but I'd like to get you out
from under that horse if I can.
Open up that gate and I'll walk him out.
Let me ask you something.
- Are you in fact Tom Horn?
- Yes, I am.
Goddamn, Tom.
You know, here in Jerkville,
where these yokels...
is busy flicking dandruff
off their mail-order suits...
they forget awful quick
that it was men like you that made it...
safe and possible for them
to lead out their dull little lives.
Right now,
I wish I had nothing to do with it.
- What's your name?
- John Coble.
What can I do for you, John?
Well, first, I'd like to offer you my ranch
till you get recovered.
We better stop and water our horses
here at Brown's Hole.
We should move on as quickly as we can.
Tom, some of those cows in there
are mine.
What are you looking at, Mr. Coble?
We're just gonna water our horses,
and we'll be moving on.
You like to buy some of them cows?
I don't want no trouble, and like I say,
we'll be moving on.
How about a little dance?
Give us a little dance, Mr. Coble.
Dance.
I said dance.
All right, Mr. Coble,
why don't you just ride on out?
Get that shooter
and put it in this water trough.
Move!
You son of a bitch!
I'll get you, you son of a bitch!
Tom, that little deal
back there at Brown's Hole...
ought to give you an idea of what
we've been putting up with out here.
I ain't never seen roping like that. Damn!
He sure don't rope like no Christian.
I wanna tell you.
Any means that you have to take...
to eliminate this rustling problem...
we're all behind you 100%.
- Whole organization?
- All of us.
Hey, Tom. How you feeling?
We're plugging along.
I'm giving a little party at the house.
I'd like you to meet everybody.
- I'm kind of raggedy.
- Nobody'll mind.
Most of the Association will be there,
and they're all anxious to meet you.
Okay.
Pipe down.
Ladies and gentlemen,
in this age of quarter-section pastures...
and tinhorn legislators
who is riding our old trails...
it's a real pleasure to welcome
a vestige of that heroic era...
that we just about lost.
Standing beside me, right here...
is the legendary tracker and interpreter
of the Apache wars...
Tom Horn.
You're welcome, sir.
Tom, this is Arlo Chance.
- Tom.
- Ora Haley.
Howdy.
- lan MacGregor.
- Proud to meet you.
What's the matter, Tom?
- What is it?
- It's a lobster.
I'll be darned.
I've never eaten a bug that big before.
That's a Maine lobster.
Broiled alive, packaged in seaweed...
and shipped out here by train.
At every station, the conductor drains
the melted seawater off of them.
- You getting the hang of it?
- I'm trying.
Tom, I don't know
whether John here told you...
but we've got
a hell of a range problem here.
The damn rustlers have
completely wiped out our herd profits...
not to mention...
what the buzzards and the predators
have done to our cash crops.
We got people
homesteading our rangeland...
and raising sheep on our grass.
Right at the present time, Mr. Horn,
what's your primary source of livelihood?
Mr. Coble offered me
to ease up at his place for a while...
and I said I'd earn my keep.
That's good enough.
Tom, you met Joe Belle?
United States Marshal.
Hello.
I'm not wanted for anything, am I?
Why don't you two fellows see...
if you can get your heads together
for a few minutes?
Go ahead.
- Do you know who I am?
- No.
What you used to be in the southwest...
I used to be in the northwest.
How does that work?
I know that you've been,
as I've been, a man hunter.
I was a tracker.
Better still.
John Coble's put in
a pretty fervent recommendation for you...
to The Cattlemen's Association
to help control the rustling.
I believe his point was...
handling rustlers after your experience
with the Apache wars...
should be like shooting fish in a barrel.
Now, you're talking about...
the high side of shooting
and the low side of the law.
Bring them to trial if you like.
I feel that what I know about you...
you're gonna wanna go ahead and shoot.
From the standpoint of the Association,
that's going to be entirely up to you.
Whether I bring them in or shoot?
Is your problem.
You're a U.S. Marshal.
You tell me, what's the difference...
between a U.S. Marshal and an assassin?
A Marshal's checks come in on time.
Say, did Buffalo Bill ever ask you
to be in his Wild West Show?
Yeah, he asked me once out in Arizona,
where we had a lot of people killed.
He offered me my own act.
Like I said, we had a lot of people killed.
Joe.
- Can I talk with you a minute?
- Sure.
Man of the West, Indian tracker,
and scared to death of lobster.
It was my first time.
What do you...
Teach school.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- What were you going to ask me?
- That.
- What?
- What you do.
I teach school.
School teacher?
What was it like out in Indian territory?
Lonely as hell.
- What did you do out in the West?
- Cowboy.
What do you do for Mr. Coble?
Cowboy.
Joe, I think we've found our man.
Not anything in Brown's Hole
I couldn't take care of.
Well, I think Horn's reputation...
might be as effective
as his Winchester is here.
I have quite a good reputation myself.
It always seems to precede me.
I know that, Joe, but...
your political ambitions are gonna
fit right in with our future plans.
Now, we don't wanna forget that, do we?
And, besides...
there won't be no chocolate cake
for Horn up there at Brown's Hole.
- Where are you from originally?
- Hawaii.
Hawaii?
Yeah, Hawaii.
Did you live in one of those grass huts?
In a hotel.
- They have those there?
- Sure they do.
Sure come a long way
to teach school in Wyoming.
I guess you could say
I've had a romance with the West...
since I was old enough to read.
- You miss that ocean?
- Sometimes.
You know, I never learned how to ride.
Is that right?
Glendolene.
It's a nice afternoon, John.
I enjoyed my lobster.
And I know Mr. Horn did, too.
I'm glad you liked it.
- Excellent afternoon, John.
- Joe.
Tom.
Giddap.
The way I see this,
you'll be a stock detective.
See that the rustling gets stopped.
You can stay here at the ranch...
and I'll pay your wages as a cowhand.
$200 for every rustler
that goes somewhere else...
to ply his trade.
- Who do I report to?
- To me.
And as far as you are concerned,
you and Joe Belle never discussed this.
And for that matter, neither have I.
Twenty-five. Do I hear 25?
Would you bid 30? Thank you.
Now a half. Would you bid a half?
Would you bid 35? 40. Thank you, sir.
Now a half. Would you bid a half?
How about going on for a half? $1.50.
Would you bid $2? Did I hear $2?
I got $2 right over here. Thank you, sir.
Sold to Western Trail Packing Company
for $2.
Could I see that bill of sale?
Thank you, son.
You consider this an actual bill of sale?
I'm just the auctioneer, sir.
The bill of sale's been sworn to.
Well, whoever swore to it...
was a liar and a cow thief.
Those cows belong to John Coble
of the Wood River Cattle Company.
Who the hell are you?
Stock detective.
What's a stock detective?
Me.
You may call yourself
some kind of stock detective...
but I'm a deputy sheriff,
and I'm the law here.
Lock these men up. I'll file the charges.
Nobody's going to jail,
unless you start some trouble.
I see.
I'll tell you what, Horn. I'm gonna kill you.
You ain't gonna kill nobody.
If he don't, I will.
- Your damn charges ain't gonna stick.
- lf the charges don't stick...
I'll just take it between us
as who gets who first.
That's how it's gonna be, then.
There won't be no more cows stolen.
Not from
the Wood River Cattle Company...
the Bar-Three Cattle Company,
or the Haley Cattle Company.
Consider that my last word on the matter.
Come on, boys, let's have an auction.
You know, I got a weird feeling.
Yo, me too.
We're being followed.
Look!
Tell them what you saw here.
That you, Horn?
You coming in here after me?
Giddap! Come on.
Get them up there.
Hang in there. Come on.
Let him stop first, then give him slack.
Hitch him up.
Hang in there.
Ease up on him there. You got him.
Yeah, he's a good horse. You go ahead...
ride him around a little bit
and tire him out.
Keep his head up. If you keep his head up,
he ain't gonna buck.
- Could I talk to you a minute?
- You bet.
All right, you go ahead
and take the rough off of him.
I'll come back after he's quieted down
and put a handle on him.
What'll I do if I get into a real storm
with this horse?
Just get off of him the best you can,
but don't let him roll in that saddle.
I think that...
I need that horse!
Shit. Stop that horse!
I need that horse.
Get that horse.
I can understand you smaller children...
but you older children have no excuses.
So, we're going to stay
until you get it right.
Now, I don't want any erasures,
so turn the page and start fresh.
Put that mouse in your pocket.
I brung you a horse.
Class dismissed.
Lord, it's like a stampede.
- I'm not dressed for riding.
- Sure.
Go on home. Go on.
- I'm not dressed for riding.
- Why, sure you are.
Why, women ride all the time
dressed like that.
I busted that horse for you.
Come on, I'll boot you up on him.
- He's beautiful.
- He's a good horse.
Come on, I'll put you up there.
Okay. Done.
You all right?
- How do I get...
- Take hold of these reins.
Grab his reins,
grab a little handful of his mane.
Give him a little kick in the slats.
Yeah. Hold on with your thighs.
That's it. Kind of roll your hips a little.
Roll your hips along with the horse.
You ride good.
So, I finally got my teaching diploma...
and I taught in Cincinnati for a while,
and Denver, and...
Well, I've been everywhere.
I'm an adventuress.
I thought that was a girl
that worked in dance halls.
- No?
- No. That's a girl who goes on adventures.
How do you figure this day
we're having out here?
- An adventure.
- Yeah?
How do I work into it, this adventure?
I see a man of the Old West
trying to live in the New.
Do you know how raggedy-ass
and terrible the Old West really was?
- No.
- lf you spend any time with me...
you'll find out just how
raggedy-ass it was.
You love it out here, don't you?
Yes, I do.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Looking for Lee Mendenhour's place.
Two drainages over is a little basin.
Lee is situated on the morning side.
- What's your name?
- Tom Horn.
Well, I thought maybe.
Look, I ain't never stole nothing.
I sure am sorry about Lee.
- He wasn't too damn bad a fellow.
- He's still with us.
He is now.
Well, he weren't too bad a fellow.
Those are Coble's cattle
you're running there.
Same old deal.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.
You get my note,
tell you to get out of this area?
Yeah, I got your fucking note.
I rolled it up with some tobacco
and I smoked it.
That what I did, champion.
You killed my horse, you son of a bitch.
- How are you?
- Morning.
Howdy, John.
Gentlemen.
It's this Horn situation. We got a problem.
You think maybe he might be
just a little bit too protective?
You know we still got
the Nolt sheep problem on the south fork.
But the rustling has stopped.
Yeah. I think it's his rifle
every bit as much as his reputation...
that's done that.
It's almost a foregone conclusion
that this fellow's working for us.
You know, after that incident in town,
we're just within one damn inch...
of having our names splattered
all over the newspaper...
and I don't have to tell you
what an embarrassing situation...
that can put all of us in.
What do you suggest?
John, we just can no longer
afford this fellow.
He's only doing
what we hired him to do, you know.
The time has come for us
to divest ourselves of this Mr. Horn.
How?
I think Joe there
is the answer to that question.
Let this thing lie down, John. Understand?
Thank you, John.
I'll be. I wonder what he did.
Put down the paper and play.
It's cold.
Nolt boy got killed, Tom.
- Who's that?
- Nolt boy, Jimmy Nolt.
How did that happen?
Shot with a.45-.60.
That's what I shoot, a.45-.60.
Shoot what, Tom?
Prairie dog.
- Jimmy Nolt's dead.
- Yeah.
Where's your horse?
He's dead, too.
I knew you'd be there.
- You did not.
- Okay.
I heard the news.
You still working that horse
I started for you?
It's about the Nolt boy.
What about him?
They found a rock under his head.
Like those other three fellows
from Brown's Hole.
You seen Joe Belle around?
The Association sent him up
to talk to Coble.
Trying to figure what they're gonna do
with a child killer like Tom Horn.
People think you did it.
You don't understand what's going on,
do you?
No, I can't say as I do.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking I want a drink.
Whiskey, George.
Leave the bottle.
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right, Charles.
- Let's get started.
- What'll I need, Joe?
Just your writing things.
Where's Tom Horn?
He's over to the Interocean Hotel.
What kind of condition is he in?
He'll be just about where we want him
by the time we get set up.
Come on over here.
We got a mattress laid out here
for you behind the door.
- Can you write okay lying down?
- Can you rig me a little light?
Absolutely.
Got the bottom of the door planed off
so you can hear real good.
But you got to be real quiet.
Joe, what if Tom Horn sees me in there?
- You mean, will he kill you?
- Yes.
I'm not going to let that happen, Charles.
A man like that you don't want
to get mad at you.
I'm going to be sitting
right over there at my desk.
I've got this Colt patent.44 in my vest...
and a German automatic
over there in the drawer...
one of the new ones. What I need is...
for Tom Horn to talk himself
into a terrible tangle...
and for you to get it down on paper.
It's no good for us
just to write it down later.
You mean it has to be in his own words?
Just like I said, Charles.
Hello, Tom.
Hello, Joe.
I got a letter yesterday
from a fellow up in Montana.
What'd he want?
I'm not so sure
this is the spot to be talking.
Got a bottle of mescal in my office,
and it's quiet.
Sure.
You've spent some time in the hills,
haven't you?
Most of my life, Tom.
- But the world is changing fast.
- I can see that.
And a man had better get with it.
I've been trying to work
a few things out in my mind.
Staying in a hotel and being able
to get a drink right away seems to help.
Think you'll ever get back
in them hills again?
I don't know. Scares me to death.
I see you're carrying a belly gun.
I've never known you to do that before.
Well, carrying a rifle in town and all...
I got this inquiry from Montana...
for a man who could come up there
and see to himself...
and look to a few things that-a-way...
in respect to the cattle stealing going on
in the Big Moon up there in that district.
- What's required?
- Some ability with a rifle.
You know, Joe,
nobody ever offered to give me an office.
- Make you feel kind of special, does it?
- I don't know.
If I had your ability with a rifle...
nobody would ever expect me
to come in out of the field.
As it is, I spend half my time
on the railroad...
handcuffed to some petty criminal,
as just a delivery man.
What's the best shot you ever made, Tom?
I don't know.
What about Mendenhour?
If it was me,
I'd say it wasn't much of a shot.
Wouldn't you rather shoot a Sharps.50
instead of that.45-.60?
Those old buffalo guns carry better,
but with a.45-.60...
you can get rounds at any general store.
Keeps a drygulcher in business.
Tom, on the killing of this kid...
- that was quite a shot.
- Was it?
Two hundred thirteen yards.
What do you know about that?
What I just told you.
You afraid of dying, Joe?
Yes, I am.
I am afraid of losing my ability
to be able to come and go as I please.
Lose my freedom.
Not be able to get back up
in those hills again.
What would they do to a man...
that killed a 15-year-old boy
with a Winchester?
I believe that man would have to die.
And you believe that a.45-.60
that's got a trajectory like a rainbow...
could make that shot?
I know it could happen.
If I'd have killed that kid...
it would have been
the best shot I ever made...
and the dirtiest trick I ever done.
Hello, Sam.
I'm going to have to arrest you
for the murder of Jimmy Nolt.
Taking yourself kind of serious, ain't you?
What are you going to do
with that Winchester?
We're just going to have to find out,
ain't we?
Yeah, I guess we are.
I'll take that rifle, Tom.
Hello, Earl.
And the belly gun.
Come on, Tom.
Wait right there, Tom.
Don't put that pistol in that drawer.
Keep it in your pocket.
You got anything in your pockets, Tom?
I got some Indian stuff here...
some shells in a sheepskin,
a little bit of change.
You ready?
No, upstairs. Bill, you stay down here.
I'm going to put you in this one.
I know how you love those hills.
You can see a little bit of them from here.
Don't close that door until I get over
to that window, would you?
Is it true Horn worked for the Association?
I've nothing to say on that.
Is the Association going to pay
for his defense?
I told you, I have no more to say.
John Coble to see you.
This is Thomas Burke.
He'll be your legal counsel now.
Every boy needs one of those.
Mr. Burke's the man
to put an end to all this for you.
- I ain't got no money to pay you.
- I'll pay that.
They're going to have you
come to court very quickly.
Have you ever been tried
for anything before?
Yeah, once.
It was a military trial a long time ago.
- A couple of scouts and myself.
- What were you charged with?
Invasion of Mexico.
Tom, I have to move on with this
as quick as I can.
You think I killed that boy?
That question will never come up
between us.
Why not? It's going to come up in court.
When do I go to trial?
They're bringing in a judge
and swearing in a jury right now.
I'd like to set up a time
we could get together...
and maybe make a preparation or two.
What for?
What are we going to talk about...
if we don't talk about
whether I killed that kid or not?
Mr. Burke, I'd like to talk to Tom
alone for a minute.
You ever see so many bars in your life?
I guess that's why they call it a jail.
- I've been free all my life, John.
- I know that.
Look, it's damn important
you don't try to break out of here.
I know you can do it,
but it's just admitting your guilt if you try.
Christ, I can see those hills over there,
but I can't touch them.
Cowboys.
Schoolteachers.
You sure are good company.
Yes, but do you care for me?
That horse over there...
is the only thing I've owned
for a long time.
He thinks the whole world of me...
and I've never even given him a name.
Was he good company?
Yeah.
- Do you care for him?
- Yes, I do.
Tom, you're an idiot.
Yeah, I know.
- What happened to your tooth there?
- Chipped it.
How'd you do that?
Riding horses. I've been riding all my life.
Get down!
Get dressed.
How about giving me back
those Indian charms of mine?
They're just sentimental value,
nothing more.
Earl, get Tom's Indian stuff
and bring it up here, will you?
Anything else you want?
- Well, my rifle.
- No.
- How about a nice fast horse?
- No.
You getting all choky
seeing me behind bars?
God damn you.
- What are these buttons for?
- Just lucky.
- The paper said they're charms.
- Yeah, they are.
- Said you believed in them.
- I do.
- Show me how they work.
- Someday.
Who are those fellows out there
with those rifles?
That's the National Guard.
The paper said they didn't think
we could hold you in jail...
and they got kind of personal about it.
Open this thing up, Earl. Let us in.
John Coble's here to see Tom.
Here you go.
John brought you a suit
to wear at the trial.
All right, you fellows can have
about 10 minutes.
Come on, Earl.
It's real important that
you let Burke guide you in court.
And you be as closed-mouthed as you can
around that prosecuting attorney.
- Who is he?
- His name's Walter Stoll.
He is effective.
They say he's running for office again...
and this trial will be
kind of a showground for him.
If he convicts you, he'll be a big hero.
He needs to hang you to get elected.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
You could have been riding
right through this two-bit town.
- People been trying to kill me all my life.
- I've got to tell you something.
I knew the Association wanted
to get rid of you...
because they told me.
But I just didn't know what to do. They...
I didn't know nothing about...
the Nolt boy...
or how it happened, but...
Who the hell could have done
such a thing?
But I know one thing.
You never killed that kid.
I figure folks would have to do
something about me sooner or later...
the frontier closed and all.
I never knew anybody that knew anything
but just killing and getting killed.
After a while, it's all you know.
Now listen,
if it all goes wrong in there for me...
I know you're my friend, John...
and I know that you care about me.
Now sit down,
and I'll whip your ass at checkers.
Good day.
That's fine, Tom.
Tom, you can step up
to the counsel's table here.
Earl, back over here.
You boys split up.
The Honorable Judge Scott.
This court is now in session.
Mr. Ohnhouse,
you were in the next room at the time...
under the orders of Marshal Belle...
and you listened very carefully
to the conversation...
between Marshal Belle and Mr. Horn.
Is that correct?
Yes.
Will you tell the court exactly
what you took down at that time?
The last thing Mr. Horn said
before leaving Joe Belle's office was:
"When I shot that kid...
"it was the best shot I ever made...
"and the dirtiest trick I ever did."
I want order in this courtroom.
Your witness.
No questions.
You may step down.
The prosecution calls Mr. Tom Horn.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth...
so help you God?
Did you listen carefully
to contents of the transcription...
as read by Mr. Ohnhouse to the court?
Yes, I did.
And you understand that this is a record
of your conversation with Marshal Belle?
Well, it was "Mr. Horn said this"
and "Mr. Belle said that."
I don't follow.
What I'm trying to get you to understand...
is that that was a conversation
between me and Joe Belle.
I understood that. Do you?
Yes, I do.
Do you consider it an accurate
transcription of that conversation?
You'll have to ask that fellow
that wrote it down.
I don't know how good he was at it.
Can you offer us an opinion?
What did you say your name was?
Walter Stoll.
I'm prosecuting you for murder.
Well, Mr. Stoll, I was just a little drunk.
Why?
Because I'd been drinking.
What's your problem now?
I didn't understand you.
We're trying you for murder,
for a capital offense.
So far, no one has had much success
in getting your attention.
Well, I've been in jail.
You've been in jail?
What has that got to do
with your lackadaisical response...
to the questions of the court?
I'm a little bored.
What Prosecutor Stoll is trying
to apprise you of is that...
we're trying to decide whether or not...
you're guilty of a crime
for which you should be hung.
You're gonna do what you have to do.
Do you object to the assertion
of Marshal Belle...
that you killed Jimmy Nolt?
That was your reply
in the transcribed conversation.
Mr. Horn?
Did anybody see me kill that kid?
There were not, and you know it,
any witnesses.
I think what the prosecutor is trying
to say to you is that...
we would keenly like
to have you reply specifically...
to the accusation that you killed this boy.
You want me to say
whether I did or I didn't do it?
In effect, yes...
although a plea of innocence
has been entered.
I'm not going to give you the satisfaction.
Now, whether you or Stoll...
or that sold-out,
son-of-a-bitching marshal Joe Belle...
want to see me guilty, you go right ahead.
But I'm not going to give you
any more satisfaction than I have to.
Whether you shoot me or hang me...
or take my rifle or my horse...
one reason is as good as another.
And I believe that, I do.
That's my last word on this matter.
I want order in this court.
In the interest of a fair trial,
I'm going to suggest...
there's something about our proceedings
which seem to elude Mr. Horn here.
But forgiving, I'm going to suggest...
that his life
in the lawless parts of our country...
have left him entirely unfamiliar
with the processes of the law.
And I strongly suggest...
that someone who is interested
in his welfare...
educate him in our ways.
I'm not sure it is necessary to point out...
that it is his life which is in question here.
It's cold in the night.
I've been kind of down on my luck lately,
and I want to try to revive it.
This may sound kind of off-center to you...
but I want to take my Indian charms
and set them under my bunk tonight.
So when you come in the morning
to give me my breakfast, I'd appreciate it...
if you didn't look at them.
I'll probably be asleep...
because I'll be up
most of the night, thinking.
Sure, Tom.
Two bourbons.
What I'm trying to prove, Philip...
is that criminals like Tom Horn
are not immune to prosecution.
The newspapers and the legal profession...
are going to set things straight
in this country.
And our system of justice insures that...
killers like Tom Horn
get exactly what they deserve.
And I'm going to see that it happens.
Where are the rifles in here?
The sheriff said we can't keep them
in here no longer.
- You got a gun?
- No.
You going to kill me?
You and I are walking out of here,
and you're going to smile. Now smile!
Keep smiling.
Smile.
Listen, I've got a.41 caliber in your back.
You damn fools.
What are you trying to do, kill him?
Shit.
You damn fools.
Someday, you're going to have to pay
for your way of life, Tom.
You're a bad man and I know it.
And if I let you talk me out of it,
I'll be lost forever.
And my adventures in this life
won't mean anything...
because you will have seduced my soul...
and drawn me into your world.
Goodbye, Tom.
Has his weight been varying much
here in jail?
I don't believe so.
It's stayed about the same.
- Do you know how tall he is?
- I ain't sure.
All right, Tom. Step out.
Up on the scales.
What's this for?
I'm designing your gallows, Mr. Horn.
I've got to get the weights exactly right.
If this thing works the way I designed it...
you should fall absolutely straight, stop,
and make a half-turn to the right.
- Will I be alive or dead?
- When?
When I make that half-turn to the right.
You should be dead.
Nobody wants to spring the trap on you.
Mr. Julian here is designing
something special for us.
The trap is water operated.
Christ, you ain't
going to drown me, are you?
No. You just step onto the platform...
and your weight will activate
a water valve...
that finally springs the trap.
All right, step back inside.
Do I spring that trap myself?
Exactly.
Makes me feel like I'm committing suicide.
You suppose that's what I've been doing
all these years, Sam?
Don't ask me that, Tom.
Bring the scales.
Come on, Mr. Julian.
Tom, it's time.
I'm gonna have to strap you up, Tom.
Earl, I'm sorry I busted your head
so hard against those bars.
That's all right, Tom.
This is Father J. P. Rank.
- How do you do?
- Fine, Tom. You?
- How long you had that Bible?
- Twenty-eight years.
Got her about bucked out yet?
I think so.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- I understand you're getting married, son.
- Yes, I am, Mr. Horn.
You take good care of her, now.
Right there, Tom.
Keep your nerve, Sam,
because I'm going to keep mine.
All right. Tom, step back on the trap.
There.
Sam, I've never seen...
such a pasty-faced bunch of sheriffs
in my life.
