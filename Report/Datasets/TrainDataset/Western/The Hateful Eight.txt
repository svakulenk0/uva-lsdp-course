MAN : Hyah! Huh!
Get in there now!
Get in! Get in!
Get in there, Dude!
- Get in now!
-
Hyah! Come on! Huh!
All right! Huh!
- Huh!
-
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa.
Got room for one more?
Who the hell are you?
And what happened to them?
Name's Major Marquis Warren,
former U.S. Cavalry.
Currently a servant of the court.
Trying to bring a couple
no-goods into market.
Got the paperwork on 'em in my pocket.
You takin' 'em into Red Rock?
Figure that's where you headed, right?
I am.
That damn blasted blizzard has been
on our ass for the last three hours.
There ain't no way we gonna
make it all the way to Red Rock
- 'fore it catches us.
- So you hightailin' it halfway,
to Minnie's Haberdashery?
You know I am.
May I come aboard?
Well, smoke,
if it up to me, yes.
But it ain't up to me.
Who's it up to?
Fella in the wagon.
Fella in the wagon ain't partial to company?
Fella in the wagon,
he paid for a private trip,
and I'm here to tell you,
he paid a pretty penny for privacy.
So if you want to go to Minnie's with us,
you gonna have to talk to him.
Well...
that's what I'll do.
-
- MAN: Hold it, black fella.
'Fore you approach,
you take them two guns of yours
and you lay 'em on that rock over yonder.
Then you raise both your hands
way above your hat.
Then you approach.
Molasses-like.
Real trustin' fella, huh?
Not so much.
MAN: Put 'em down.
Come on ahead.
I said way above your hat, goddamn it!
Now come forward.
That's far enough.
: Well, I'll be dogged.
You a black fella I know.
Colonel somethin'-or-other Warren, right?
Major Marquis Warren.
I know you, too.
We, uh, shared a steak dinner
once upon a time in Chattanooga.
You John Ruth The Hangman.
That'd be me.
How long's that been?
Since that steak?
Oh... eight months.
So why don't you explain to me
what a African bounty hunter's doin'
wanderin' around in the snow
in the middle of Wyoming?
Trying to get a couple
of bounties in to Red Rock.
So you still in business?
: You know I am.
Happened to your horse?
Circumstances caused us to have
to take the long way round.
- My horse couldn't make it.
- Mm.
You don't know nothin' 'bout this filly here.
Nope.
- Don't even know her name?
- Nope.
Well, I guess that makes this
one fortuitous wagon.
I sure as hell hope so.
Major Marquis Warren,
this here's Daisy Domergue.
Domergue, to you this is Major Warren.
Howdy, nigger.
She's a pepper, ain't she?
Now, girl, don't you know the darkies
don't like being called niggers no more?
They find it offensive.
I been called worse.
: Now, that I can believe.
You never heard of her, huh?
Should I?
Well, she ain't no John Wilkes Booth,
but maybe you might heard tell
about the price on her head.
- WARREN: How much?
- $10,000.
Damn.
What'd she do, kill Lily Langtry?
: Not quite.
That ten thousand's practically in my pocket.
It's why I ain't too anxious
to be handin' out rides,
especially to professionals
open for business.
I can certainly appreciate that.
But I ain't got no designs on her.
One of my fellas over there is worth $4,000,
another one's worth $3,000,
and one of 'em's worth $1,000.
That's damn sure good enough for me.
Well... let me see their paperwork.
Like I said, molasses-like.
Back off.
-
-
DRIVER: Look, I sure hate
to interrupt you all,
but we got a cold damn blizzard
that's hot on our ass
that we're tryin' to beat to shelter!
I realize that! Now, shut your mouth
and hold them damn horses while I think!
Okay, boy, we'll give it a try.
But you leave them two pistols
over yonder with the driver.
DOMERGUE: Hey, uh, you ain't really
gonna let that nigger ride in here, is ya?
I mean, maybe up there with O.B., but...
-
-
JOHN: How ya like the sound
of them bells, bitch?
They real pretty, ain't they?
You open up your trashy mouth again,
I'll knock out them front teeth for ya.
- You got it?
-
: Yeah.
Let me hear ya say, "I got it."
I got it.
Uh, I'm gonna need a hand tyin'
these fellas up on the roof.
Give O.B. $50 when we get to Red Rock.
He'll help ya.
Well, I agree with O.B.
This storm got me concerned.
We get goin' a lot quicker
you helped out, too.
Goddamn it to hell,
I'm already regrettin' this.
Now, I can't likely help you tie fellas
to the roof with my wrist cuffed to hers.
And my wrist is gonna stay cuffed to hers,
and she ain't never gonna
leave my goddamn side
till I personally put her
in the Red Rock jail!
Now, do you got that?
Yeah, I got it.
Good.
O.B.: Get in, Dude!
Hut! Get in!
Go on! Hut!
Come on!
Dude, Coconut, giddyup.
Yah!
Hut!
Giddyup!
Yah! Cimarron! Leche! Get in!
So, what happened to your horse?
O.B.: Get in!
He was kinda old.
I done had him for a bit.
When the weather took a turn for the worse,
well, he done what he could,
but he couldn't make it.
- O.B.: Get in!
- That's too bad.
Yeah, it is.
Me and ol' Lash done rode
a lot of miles together.
Could say he was my best friend,
if I considered stupid animals
friends, which I don't.
Nevertheless, I'm gonna miss him.
O.B.: Leche! Ha!
WARREN: Who's this Daisy Domergue?
A no damn good murdering bitch, that's who.
O.B.: Come on, boys! Get up!
I see you ain't got mixed emotions
about bringing a woman to a rope.
By "woman," you mean her?
No, I do not have mixed emotions.
O.B.: Get in! Ha!
So you taking her into Red Rock to hang.
You bet.
You gonna wait round to watch it?
: Oh, you know I am.
- O.B.: Come on!
- I want to hear her neck snap
with my own two ears.
O.B.: Get up, boys!
- You never wait to watch 'em hang?
- Get up!
My bounties never hang,
'cause I never bring 'em in alive.
- Never?
- Never ever.
- O.B.: Ha! Get up! Yah!
- We talked about this
in Chattanooga. Bringing
desperate men in alive's
a good way to get yourself dead.
- O.B.: Get in there!
- Can't catch me sleeping
if I don't close my eyes.
I don't want to work that hard.
No one said the job is supposed to be easy.
No one said it's supposed to be
that hard, neither.
- O.B.: Get up, boys! Ha!
- But that, little lady,
is why they call him "The Hangman."
When the handbill says "dead or alive,"
the rest of us shoot ya in the back
from up on top of a perch somewhere,
- bring ya in dead over a saddle.
- O.B.: Get in!
But when John Ruth The Hangman catches ya,
you don't die from no bullet in the back.
Mm-mm.
When The Hangman catches you, you hang.
O.B.: Ha!
You overrate him, nigger.
I give ya he got guts,
but in the brains department,
he like a man who took
a high dive in a low well.
- Now, Daisy,
-
I want us to work out a signal
system of communication.
When I elbow you real hard in
the face, that means "shut up."
You got it?
I got it.
-
- O.B.: Get in there!
Come on now, boys, get in!
Hey, little apple blossom
What seems to be the problem?
All the ones you tell your troubles to
They don't really care for you
Come and tell me what you're thinking
'Cause just when the boat is sinking
A little light is blinking
And I will come and rescue you
Lots of girls walk around in tears
But that's not for you
You've been looking all around for years
-  For someone to tell your troubles to
- Ha!
Come and sit with me and talk a while
Let me see your pretty little smile
Put your troubles in a little pile
And I will sort them out
for you, all right.
- O.B.: Hyah!
-
Get in!
O.B.: Get in there!
Mm.
O.B.: Giddyup!
I, uh... I know we only
met each other the once before,
- and I don't mean to unduly imply intimacy,
- Get up!
- ...but, well...
- Yah!
...you still got it?
Do I still got what?
O.B.: Get in, now!
The Lincoln letter.
Mm. Course.
O.B.: Get up, boys!
- Got it on ya?
- Mm-hmm.
O.B.: Come on!
Where?
Right here.
O.B.: Come on, boys! Get up!
Look, I know you got to be
real careful with it and all,
and I can imagine you probably
don't like taking it
in and out of the envelope all that often,
- but, uh...
- Get up!
...if you wouldn't mind, I'd sure
appreciate seeing that again.
O.B.: Get in, boys!
Ha! Giddyup!
You're right.
I don't like taking it in and out
- of the envelope that much.
- I... Yeah.
- But...
- Get in!
...seeing's how you saved my life and all...
I suppose I could let you read it again.
O.B.: Get in! Ha!
Get in there!
Get up now!
Get in!
Giddyup!
Huh!
Get in, now!
Get in!
"Ole Mary Todd's calling,
so I guess it must be time for bed."
Ole Mary Todd.
O.B.: Ha!
Get in!
- Well, that...
- Get up, boys!
...that gets me.
Yeah, it gets me, too.
O.B.: Get in! Get in!
You know what this is, tramp? Hmm?
It's a letter from Lincoln.
- Letter from Lincoln to him.
- Get in there!
Yeah.
They shared a correspondence during the war.
They was pen pals.
- And this is just one of the letters.
- Get up!
What the...
- Hyah!
- WARREN: O.B.!
Stop!
O.B.: Whoa!
Easy.
Whoa.
All the stupid...
Like to rip my goddamn arm off!
I didn't drag her stinking ass
up this goddamn mountain
just for you to break her neck
on the outskirts of town!
You the one handed her my goddamn letter!
- I didn't give it to her, I give it to you!
-
That nigger like to bust my jaw.
You ruin that letter of his, that nigger
gonna stomp your ass to death.
And when he do, I'm gonna sit back on
that wagon wheel, watch and laugh!
How is it?
Well, she ain't help it none.
But it's all right.
Is that the way niggers treat their ladies?
You ain't no goddamn lady!
O.B.: Hey, Mr. Ruth!
What?
There's another fella on foot
up here on the road.
MAN : Hey!
What?
I said there's another fella
on foot, up here on the road.
MAN: Hey! Hey!
Considering there's a blizzard going on,
whole lot of fellas walking around,
wouldn't you say, Major?
Well, seeing as how I'm half of them fellas,
uh, yeah, seems to be a lot of us.
This changes things, son.
$8,000 a lot of money for a nigger.
With a partner, 18's a whole lot better.
You really think I'm in cahoots
with that fella, or her?
Put them on.
Oh, I ain't wearing no handcuffs.
You put those on, or you can stop
worrying about this whole thing right now!
MAN: Hey!
MAN: Hey!
JOHN: Hand your weapons to the driver.
Little jumpy, ain't you?
Never mind the jokes. Just do it.
If you say so.
I do.
Okay.
I done done it.
O.B., you got 'em?
I got 'em.
Okay, fella.
You keep holding that lantern
in that one hand,
and you keep that other hand
where I can see it.
Walk over there where I can
get a good look at ya.
Well, I'll be a goddamn dog in a manger.
Is that you, Chris Mannix?
I'm sorry, friend, do we know each other?
Not quite.
You know this fella?
Only by reputation.
Like I said, friend, you got me
at a bit of a disadvantage.
Keeping you at a disadvantage
is an advantage I intend to keep.
Uh, whoever you are, mister,
you sure sound tough
when you talking to a desperate
man knee-deep in snow.
I... I don't want no trouble.
I just want a ride.
I'm freezing to death!
Who is this joker?
You heard of the rebel renegade
Erskine Mannix?
- Mannix's Marauders?
- That's them.
Scourge of South Carolina,
Mannix's Marauders.
It's Erskine's youngest boy, Chris.
Brings you in my path, Chris Mannix?
Well, Mr. Face, I was riding to Red Rock,
my horse stepped in
a gopher hole in the snow,
fucked up his leg, had to put 'er down.
You got business in Red Rock?
- Yes, I do.
- What?
I'm the new sheriff.
: Horseshit.
- 'Fraid not.
- Where's your star?
Well, I ain't the sheriff yet.
Now, once I get there, they swear me in.
But, uh, that ain't happened yet.
And that's when you get your star.
You got anything that can
back any of this up?
Yeah. When we get to Red Rock.
And from the look of those
three frozen fuckers up there,
I figure you a bounty hunter
open for business.
And I figure you taking them three
dead bodies into Red Rock to get paid?
Three dead.
One alive.
CHRIS: Who's that?
JOHN: Daisy Domergue.
Who the fuck is Daisy Domergue?
Not a goddamn thing to nobody,
except me and the hangman.
The hangman?
Well, I'll be double-dog damned.
You're "The Hangman" Bob Ruth!
It's John.
And you!
You're the nigger with the head!
Major Marquis!
My Lord, is that really the real head
of Major Marquis looking at me now?
Yeah, it's really me,
and it's really my head.
So what's going on?
Uh, y'all having a bounty hunters' picnic?
Never mind.
Uh, you taking them three dead bodies
and hurrying to Red Rock
to get paid, ain't you?
Yeah.
Well, the man in Red Rock's
supposed to pay you is me, the new sheriff.
So if y'all want to get paid,
y'all need to get me to Red Rock.
Well, excuse me
for finding it hard to believe
a town electing you to do
anything except drop dead.
So I'm supposed to freeze to death
'cause you find something hard to believe?
No, I suppose not.
Put them on and come inside.
No.
Then you'll freeze.
Then you'll hang.
How so?
Stagecoach driver, could you
come down here and join us?
I got to hold these horses.
I can hear you just fine from up here.
Well, you just heard me tell this fella
I'm the new sheriff of Red Rock, right?
O.B.: Yeah.
Red Rock is my town now.
And I'm gonna enter my town
in bounty hunter's chains?
No, sir!
Sorry, bushwhackers,
I ain't entering Red Rock that way.
Now, when you finally get to Red Rock,
you gonna realize every
goddamn thing I said was right.
And I expect you, O.B.,
to tell the townsfolk of Red Rock
that John Ruth let their
new sheriff freeze to death.
Ain't no bounty on my head, bushwhacker.
You let me die, that's murder.
JOHN: Hold out your hands.
O.B.!
Give the major back his iron.
One thing I know for sure,
this nigger-hating son of a gun
ain't partnered up with you.
Now, I'll help you protect your 8,000,
you help me protect my ten.
Deal?
Well, ain't love grand?
Y'all want to lie on the ground
and make snow angels together?
O.B.: Hut!
Come on!
Hyah!
CHRIS: Well, I'll tell you what, Bob.
JOHN: The name's John.
- When we get to Red Rock,
- O.B.: Hyah!
I'll buy you and Major Marquis there
- dinner and booze.
- O.B.: Get in!
My way of saying thanks.
I don't drink with rebel renegades,
and I damn sure don't break bread with them.
- Well, Mr. Ruth...
- O.B.: Get up, boys!
...you sound like you got a axe
to grind against the Cause.
- "The Cause" of a renegade army?
- O.B.: Get in!
Bunch of losers gone loco.
- You bet I do.
- O.B.: Get up there! Hyah!
You wrapped yourselves up in a rebel
flag as an excuse to kill and steal.
And this ought to interest you, Warren.
Imparticular, emancipated blacks.
Sounds like my kind of fella.
Sound to me you been reading
a lot of newspapers printed
in Washington, D.C.
- O.B.: Get in! Huh!
- CHRIS: Anywho, I'm just trying
to let y'all know how grateful I am.
I was a goner.
And y'all saved me.
You want to show me how grateful you are?
- O.B.: Get in there!
- Shut up.
-
- JOHN: Goddamn it, Daisy.
It's coming.
O.B.: Get in there, Cimarron!
Here.
Last piece.
O.B.: Get in!
Get in, now!
Hyah!
: Does he know...
Does he know how famous you once was?
I don't think so.
O.B.: Giddyup!
Black Eye.
- Do you know who he is?
- O.B.: Get in!
Do I know about the $30,000 reward
the Confederacy put on the head
of Major Marquis?
- O.B.: Come on now, boys!
-
- O.B.: Get in!
- Yeah.
Ah, them hillbillies
went nigger head-hunting.
- O.B.: Get in!
- They just never did get 'em
the right nigger head, did they?
No, they didn't.
But it wasn't for lack of trying.
O.B.: Get in, boys! Ha! Get on!
Them peckerwoods
left their homes and families,
and come up this snowy mountain
looking for me and fortune.
O.B.: Ha! Get up!
Ain't none of 'em found fortune.
The ones you ain't never heard of no more,
they found me.
Now, it didn't stay $30,000
the length of the war.
Once passions cooled,
it dropped down to eight, then five.
O.B.: Get up, boys! Ha!
But I bet even when it was 5,000,
you had your share
of country boys coming to call.
Mm, you know I did.
Why'd they have a reward on you?
Confederates took exception
to my capacity for killing 'em.
-
- O.B.: Get up, now!
And after I broke out of Wellenbeck,
well, the South took my continued existence
- as a personal affront.
- O.B.: Get up!
- And the Cause put a reward on my head.
- JOHN: Hmm.
O.B.: Get in there!
What's, uh, Wellenbeck?
You ain't never heard of Wellenbeck
prisoner of war camp, West Virginia?
No, reb, I ain't never heard of it.
- O.B.: Hyah!
- Did you bust out?
Oh,
Major Marquis did more than bust out.
Major Marquis had a bright idea.
O.B.: Get in, now!
So bright, you got to wonder
why nobody never thought about it before.
Tell John Ruth your bright idea.
Well, the whole damn place
was just made out of kindling.
O.B.: Get in!
So I burnt it down.
O.B.: Get in! Hyah!
There was a rookie regiment
spending overnight in the camp.
- Southern youth, farmers' sons,
- O.B.: Get up!
...cream of the crop.
And I say, "Let 'em burn."
I'm supposed to apologize
for killing Johnny Reb?
You joined the war to keep niggers in chains.
I joined the war to kill
- white Southern crackers.
- O.B.: Ha! Get up!
And that means killing 'em any way I can.
- O.B.: Get in!
- Shoot 'em, stab 'em,
drown 'em, burn 'em,
drop a big ol' rock on their head.
Whatever it took to put
white Southern crackers
- in the ground,
- O.B.: Get up!
...that's what I joined the war to do.
And that's what I did.
To answer your question, John Ruth,
when Major Marquis burned 47 men alive,
for no more reason than to give
a nigger a run for the trees,
that's when the South put a reward
on the head of Major Marquis.
- And I made them trees, Mannix.
- O.B.: Get in!
You best believe I ain't looked back
till I crossed the Northern line.
Oh, but you had a surprise waiting for
you on the Northern side, didn't you?
See, once they started pulling out
all them burnt bodies at Wellenbeck,
seems not all them boys were rebs.
Why, you burn up some of your
own boys, didn't you, Major?
How many burnt prisoners they end up finding?
Wasn't the final Yankee death
count something like 37?
- O.B.: Giddyup!
-
That's the thing about war, Mannix.
People die.
Oh.
So you gonna chalk it up
to "war is hell," huh?
Well, admittedly, that is
a hard argument to argue with.
But if memory serves,
your side didn't look at it that way.
I think they thought 37 white men
for one nigger
wasn't so hot a trade.
- I do believe they accused you
- O.B.: Giddyup!
...of being a kill-crazy nigger
who only joined the war to kill white folks,
and the whole blue and gray of it all
really didn't matter that much to you.
O.B.: Ha! Get up!
And that's why they drummed your black ass
out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down your back.
- O.B.: Get in!
- Isn't it, Major?
Horseshit!
If he'd have did all that, the cavalry
- would've shot him.
- O.B.: Get in!
Well, I didn't say they could prove it.
- O.B.: Get up!
- But they sure did
think it out loud, didn't they, Major?
O.B.: Hyah! Get up, boys!
But Warren's war record was stellar,
and that's what saved his ass.
O.B.: Hyah!
Now, you killed yourself your share
of redskins in your day,
didn't you, Black Major?
Cavalry tends to look kindly on that.
I'll tell you what the cavalry
didn't look kindly on.
- O.B.: Giddyup!
- Mannix's Marauders, that's what.
O.B.: Get in! Hyah!
And the fact that Erskine Mannix's little boy
would talk about anybody else's behavior
during war time makes me want to horse-laugh.
O.B.: Hyah!
Don't you say anything about my daddy.
- What he fought for was dignity in defeat,
- O.B.: Get up there!
...and against the unconditional surrender.
We weren't foreign barbarians
pounding on the city walls.
- O.B.: Ha!
- We were your brothers.
O.B.: Get up, now!
We deserved dignity in defeat.
WARREN: Just how many
nigger towns did y'all sack
in your fight for dignity in defeat?
Oh, my fair share, Black Major.
- 'Cause when niggers are scared,
- O.B.: Huh!
...that's when white folks are safe.
You gonna talk that hateful nigger talk,
you can ride up top with O.B.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You done got me talking politics.
I didn't want to.
Like I said, y'all,
I'm just happy to be alive.
-
- O.B.: Get in, now!
-
- O.B.: Ha! Get up!
I think I'll scoot over here
right by this window,
and let this beautiful carriage
rock me to sleep.
And dream about how lucky I am.
O.B.: Get up, now!
O.B.: Ha!
Hyah! Get in!
Get in there!
Get in, hyah!
Get in there!
Get in!
Get in there, Leche!
Get in there!
Whoa, whoa, easy.
Whoa. Whoa.
What the hell is going on?
We weren't expecting another stage tonight!
Yeah, I can see you already
got another one up in here.
Just got through putting the horses away.
Well, this ain't the normal line,
but we are stuck on
the wrong side of a blizzard,
so it looks like you're stuck with us.
Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?
They ain't here.
I'm running the place while they're gone.
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?
He says they ain't here.
He's looking after the place
while they're gone.
Who are you?
I'm Bob.
Well, whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.
Come on.
Get 'em out of this cold
'fore that blizzard hits us.
Whoa. You all right?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Esperate, esperate, esperate!
I just put those other horses away.
You need it done fast, you need to help.
I got two of my best men on it.
You heard him, freeloaders.
Get to work!
BOB: All right, you two, unhook the leaders.
Come on, let's go.
JOHN: Open up!
- MAN: You have to kick it open!
- MAN 2: Ya got to kick it open!
DOMERGUE: What?
Kick it open!
-
- Shut that door.
There's a goddamn blizzard out there!
You have to stop, close the door!
You got to nail it shut.
You have to, you have to nail it shut!
Hold it shut!
There's a hammer and nails by the door!
You have to nail it shut!
There's a hammer and nails by the door.
- JOHN: Give me a hammer.
- DOMERGUE: Yeah.
You need, you need two pieces of wood!
You need two pieces of wood!
One ain't good enough!
Two pieces of wood!
The fuckin' thing is busted!
Not just one piece of wood!
- JOHN: Give me another piece of wood.
- DOMERGUE: Yeah. All right.
- I need a nail.
- Here.
Jesus.
That door's a son of a gun.
Who's the idiot who broke that,
that Mexican fella?
Oh, good heavens.
A woman?
Out in this white hell?
You must be frozen solid, poor thing.
Looks like Minnie's got her a full house.
When did you fellas arrive?
Ah.
About 40 minutes ago.
That cowboy fella in the corner,
- that your driver?
- No, no, he's a passenger.
The driver lit out.
Said he was going to spend the blizzard
shacked up with a friend.
Lucky devil.
Jesus Christ, that's awful!
-
- Christ Almighty,
what'd that Mexican fella do,
soak his old socks in a pot?
Yes, uh... I think we all felt the same way,
but were a little too polite
to say something.
- He don't have that problem.
- Shit.
Where's the well water?
Uh, over there.
So, all three of you fellas
headed to Red Rock
when the blizzard stopped you, huh?
Yes. All three of us were
on that stagecoach out there.
Coffee beans.
Uh, over there.
Get your hand out of there.
New sheriff of Red Rock's travelin' with us.
Ah, sheriff of Red Rock, that'll be the day.
He's a goddamn sheriff, I'm a monkey's uncle.
Good.
Then you can share bananas
with your nigger friend in the stable.
So,
the new sheriff of Red Rock
is traveling with you?
Oh, he's lying.
He ain't sheriff of nothin'.
He's a Southern renegade.
He's just talking hisself
out of freezing to death is all.
What the fuck I tell you about talking, huh?
I'll bust you in the mouth
right in front of these people.
I don't give a fuck!
You never gave your name, sir.
John Ruth.
Are you a lawman?
I'm taking her to the law.
So you're a bounty hunter?
That's right, buster.
Do you have a warrant?
: Yeah, course I do.
May I see it?
Why?
Ah. You're supposed
to produce it upon request.
How am I supposed to know
you're not a villain,
kidnapping this woman,
without a warrant in your possession?
What's your name, buster?
Well, it certainly isn't Buster.
It's Oswaldo Mobray.
Oswaldo?
Yes.
Well,
I got my warrant, Oswaldo.
I take it you're Daisy Domergue?
- That's her.
- Yeah.
: I see.
Uh, it says here "dead or alive."
Yeah. It does.
Well, transporting a desperate,
hostile prisoner such as her
sounds like hard work.
Wouldn't transporting her be easier
if she were dead?
Well, no one said the job
was supposed to be easy.
And why is her hanging proper
so important to you?
Let's just say I don't like
cheatin' the hangman.
He got to make a living, too.
Well, I appreciate that.
Allow me to properly
introduce myself.
I'm Oswaldo Mobray,
the hangman in these parts.
- La-di-da.
- Ah.
Looks like I brought you a customer.
Yeah, so it would appear.
You ever spent two days or more
locked up with one of your customers before?
- I can't say I have.
- Don't talk to my prisoner.
I talk to my prisoner, that's it.
- You got it?
- I got it.
Jolly good.
You got anything in here besides
coffee that can help warm us up?
Well, the bar is open.
Follow moi.
Line, O.B.!
O.B.: Oh, whoa.
Oh.
Whoa.
BOB: Hey.
Whoa, Ace, whoa.
You're all right, you're all right.
CHRIS: Come on, goddamn it. I'm cold!
BOB: I'll feed and water the horses.
You go inside and get some hot coffee.
Got some stew cooking.
Should be done soon.
Now, look.
No matter how bad this blizzard gets,
we still got to feed these horses
and take a squat from time to time.
So me and Chris better lay out a line
from the stable to the front door
and from the front door to the shithouse.
Okay?
Good idea.
Come on, Chris.
I'll give you a hand.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Go inside. Get warm.
You're doin' stable work
in a goddamn blizzard.
I offer to help, you say no?
You're right, amigo.
Muchas gracias.
O.B.: All right. Follow me.
We're gonna drop one every ten paces,
- from here to the door.
- Yeah!
All right!
Now, you're wanted for murder.
For the sake of my analogy,
let's just assume that you did it.
Now, John Ruth wants
to take you back to Red Rock
to stand trial for murder.
And if you're found guilty,
the people of Red Rock
will hang you in the town square.
And, as the hangman,
I will perform the execution.
And if all those things
end up taking place,
that's what civilized society
calls justice.
However,
if the relatives and the loved ones
of the person you murdered
were outside that door right now,
and after busting down that door,
they drug you out into the snow
and hung you up by the neck,
that would be frontier justice.
Now, the good part
about frontier justice
is it's very thirst-quenching.
The bad part is
it's apt to be wrong as right.
Well, not in your case.
In your case, you'd have it coming.
But other people, maybe not so much.
OSWALDO: But ultimately, what's
the real difference between the two?
The real difference is me.
The hangman.
To me, it doesn't matter what you did.
When I hang you, I'll get no
satisfaction from your death.
It's my job.
I hang you in Red Rock.
I move on to the next town.
I hang someone else there.
The man who pulls the lever
that breaks your neck
will be a dispassionate man.
And that dispassion
is the very essence of justice.
For justice delivered without dispassion
is always in danger of not being justice.
JOHN: Amen.
JOHN: No offense, cowboy fella.
Just gettin' your attention.
Yeah, well...
you got it.
What you writin', friend?
Only thing I'm qualified to write about.
What's that?
My life story.
You're writing your life story?
You bet I am.
Am I in it?
You just entered.
Well, you like writing stories so much,
why don't you tell me
the story that brings you here?
Who's asking?
I am. John Ruth.
I'm bringing in this one to Red Rock to hang.
And ain't no way I'm spending
a couple of nights
under a roof with somebody
I don't know who they are,
and I don't know who you are.
So, who are you?
Joe Gage.
- What?
- That's my name.
Joe Gage.
Okay, Joe Gage.
Why you going to Red Rock?
I ain't, I ain't, I ain't going to Red Rock.
Where you going?
About nine miles outside of Red Rock.
What's there?
My mother.
Your mother?
Listen, I'm just a cowpuncher.
I just, uh, got back
from a long drive, and...
and I wasn't just an ass
in a saddle this time.
I was a partner.
First time in my life I made a pretty penny.
And, uh,
figured I'd come home
and spend time with my mother
for Christmas.
Now, that's funny.
'Cause you don't look like
the coming-home-for-Christmas type.
Yeah, well,
you know, looks can be deceiving.
Because I definitely am a
coming-home-for-Christmas-
to-spend-time-with-Mother type.
Christmas with Mother, I mean, uh,
it's a wonderful thing.
Now, is that, uh,
good enough for you,
John Ruth?
For now.
You steer clear of my prisoner.
Hello, old-timer.
General.
General.
You, sir, are a hyena.
I have no wish to speak to you.
I've been called worse.
Fair enough, General.
Sorry to bother you.
-
- CHRIS and O.B.: Hey!
- You gotta kick it open!
- Gotta kick it open!
- CHRIS and O.B.: What?
- Kick it open!
- That latch, you gotta kick it open!
- You gotta kick it open!
CHRIS: Jesus Christ!
- JOHN: Close it!
- DOMERGUE: Close it!
- JOHN: Close the door!
- CHRIS: What?
- DOMERGUE: Close it!
- JOE: The goddamn door!
- JOHN: It doesn't have a latch. Close it!
- JOE: It's already cold enough in here!
JOHN: Doesn't have a latch.
- You gotta hammer up a board.
- JOE: You gotta nail it shut!
The hammer and nails by the door.
There's a hammer and nails right there!
Ah, God!
- Hold this here, Chris.
- Here! Here.
- O.B.: Watch your fingers.
- CHRIS: Yeah.
- Really nail it in!
- O.B.: Yeah.
JOHN: You need two pieces of wood.
You got to hammer another one.
JOE: One ain't good enough!
It's gonna blow right open!
Now, goddamn it!
Gonna open if you don't ham...!
- Shut up!
- CHRIS: Ah, got it!
- O.B.: Son of a bitch!
-
Jesus Christ.
That's door's a whore.
Oh.
I get it. "Haberdashery."
That was a joke.
- How's the coffee?
-
JOHN: Now? Pretty good,
if I do say so myself.
Thank you.
Ooh!
Ha! Navajo!
Guess who he is.
Buffalo Bill?
Hardly.
No. I'm...
Oswaldo Mobray. I'm the...
He's the hangman of Red Rock.
Oh, you are?
- Yes, I am.
- : Well!
- Uh, good to meet you, uh,
- Yeah.
- Mr....?
- Uh, Mobray.
- Mobray.
- Yeah.
I'm Chris Mannix.
The new sheriff in Red Rock.
- Really?
- Pfft, horseshit!
Pay no attention to him.
Horseshit!
Fella warmin' himself by that potbelly stove
- is a hell of a driver named O.B.
- Ah.
That's the only thing
you've said that's the truth.
You comin' into Red Rock
to hang Lance Lawson?
- Precisely.
- Do you have the execution orders on you?
- In my bag.
- May I see 'em?
Of course.
Who's, uh, who's Lance Lawson?
He's a fella been sittin'
in the Red Rock jail about a month now.
He's the fella who shot the fella
who was sheriff 'fore me.
- Precisely.
-
Thank you.
What did she mean when she said,
"The bounty hunter's
nigger friend in the stable"?
He's got a nigger bounty hunter
friend in the stable.
But all that just to guard her?
Uh, I don't think that was
the original idea, but...
- that's the idea now.
- Oh. Mm.
Want a little snake bite in your coffee?
- DOMERGUE: Yeah.
-
OSWALDO: Five of you?
Well, well, well, looks
like Minnie's Haberdashery
is about to get cozy for the next few days.
Yes, it does.
- Here.
- Ah. Ah.
Are you the chap with the Lincoln letter?
The Lincoln what?
Yes. The letter from Abraham Lincoln.
President Abraham Lincoln?
Yes. Weren't you pen pals?
With the president?
Well, I'm sorry, I heard
that somebody in your party
had a letter from Abraham Lincoln.
I assumed it was you.
Not him!
Black fella in the stable.
The nigger...
in the stable has a letter
from Abraham Lincoln?
Yeah.
The nigger in the stable has
a letter from Abraham Lincoln?
What'd you say your name was again?
- Bob.
- Warren.
Minnie and Sweet Dave in there?
Minnie and Sweet Dave went
to visit her mother
on the north side of the mountain.
- What?
- Yeah.
Minnie ain't here?
Yes, they're visiting her mother.
- Her mother?
- Yes.
Hmm.
Never knew Minnie had a mother.
Well, everybody's got a mother.
Yeah, I suppose.
And she left you in charge?
Si.
That sure don't sound like Minnie.
Are you calling me a liar?
Well, not yet I ain't.
Just sounds peculiar is all.
What sounds peculiar?
Well, first off, Minnie never struck me
as the sentimental type.
And secondly, I can't imagine
Sweet Dave lifting his fat ass
out his chair long enough to fetch well water
unless Minnie was laying
a frying pan upside his head,
let alone take a trip to the north side.
Well, that sounds a whole lot
like you're calling me a liar,
mi negro amigo.
Yeah, it do sound a whole lot
like that, don't it?
But I still ain't done it yet.
Minnie still serve food?
- Do you consider stew food?
- Yes.
Then we serve food.
She still stinking up the place
with Old Quail pipe tobacco?
Minnie doesn't smoke a pipe.
She rolls her own.
Red Apple Tobacco.
But, mi negro amigo,
I think you already know this.
Yeah, I do, Senor Bob.
Just seeing if you do.
BOB : Come on!
Fill 'er up, O.B.
Yeah.
JOHN: Goddamn it.
Thank you.
CHRIS: Well, cut my legs off
and call me Shorty.
Is that General Sanford Smithers I see?
You got a good eye, son.
Ha-ha! Well, I'll be double-dog damned!
General Sandy "Don't Give a Damn" Smithers?
Captain Chris Mannix, Mannix's Marauders.
Erskine's boy?
Yes, sir.
Uh... may I sit down, sir?
Well, according to the Yankees,
it's a free country.
General Sandy Smithers. Ha-ha!
Boy...
oh, boy,
did my daddy talk about you!
I heard you gave
those Blue Bellies sweet hell.
Me and my boys did our part.
Just like Erskine and his boys
did their part.
Hell yeah, we did.
Yankee sons of bitches.
I never knew your father, son.
But I always respected his resolve.
Well, thank you for saying that, General.
Your respect would have meant
the world to him.
Can I get you some coffee?
That'd be nice.
Well, how about a blanket?
That'd be even nicer.
Hell, you know what? You can have mine.
Here we go, General.
Ha-ha! So what brings you
out Wyoming way, sir?
If you don't mind my askin'.
My boy.
- Oh, you got a boy that lives in Red Rock?
- My son.
Chester Charles Smithers.
He died out here a few years back.
Oh, forgive me, sir.
There's no forgiveness needed, son.
Like I said, it was a few years back.
It was after he'd served his service.
He came out here to the hills of Wyoming...
to make his fortune.
: Never to be heard from again.
I bought him a symbolic plot...
in the Red Rock cemetery.
And I'm here to advise
a stone maker on his headstone.
Was he a goner for sure?
No chance he could be livin'
the cold life out in the woods?
It's a rough life, but folks can learn it.
If he'd have done
what he came out here to do,
he'd have come home.
-
-
BOB: Hold it. Close it, close it!
You have to hold it closed
while I nail it shut.
WARREN: Well, who's the idiot
broke the damn door?
: Oh, j...
just fucking hold it closed!
Orale, cabron!
Hold it closed.
Okay.
One more.
BOB: Keep holding, keep holding,
- my negro amigo.
-
BOB: We need two pieces of wood.
Orale, cabron! All right.
There you go, motherfucker!
-
-
Lot of hats, Senor Bob.
Huh?
Considering Minnie's
"no hats indoors" policy,
which, if I remember correctly,
was one of them Bar of Iron rules.
Kind of rule she'd want kept up
in her absence.
You seem to have a laissez-faire attitude
when it come to the hats.
I'm guilty.
I have a laissez-faire attitude
about the hats.
How about we forget about the hats today
considering there is
a blizzard going on and on?
We'll make tomorrow "No Hat Day"!
- OSWALDO: A large black dog.
- DOMERGUE:  Now take my tip
Before you ship to join
- His name was Henry, I believe.
-  The iron gang
- Labrador.
-  Don't be too gay
In Botany Bay
Or else you'll surely hang
Or else you'll hang,
you'll hang, said he...
OSWALDO: You know, my daddy...
- I said that my daddy
-
- always said that Davis
- OSWALDO: A plum tree.
...was a courageous man,
but he should've put the capital
in Montgomery and not Richmond.
Yes, sir. I agree with that.
The army in northern Virginia
would've been used
in a very different way. I said the army
of north Virginia would've been
used in a very different way!
DOMERGUE:  They'll flog
the poaching out of you
Out there in Botany Bay.
JOHN: Shut up!
O.B.
Do you know that nigger, sir?
I don't know that nigger.
But I know he's a nigger,
and that's all I need to know.
CHRIS: Well...
that nigger just ain't any nigger.
That nigger, he...
WARREN: General Sanford Smithers?
Battle of Baton Rouge?
Inform the nigger
in the cavalry officer's uniform
that I had a division of Confederates
under my command...
in Baton Rouge.
Major Nigger, General Smithers
wishes me to inform you...
I heard him, hillbilly.
Inform this old cracker
that I was in Baton Rouge also.
On the other side.
Oh, that's interesting.
Uh, General Smithers,
he said that he was also in
Baton Rouge on the other si...
Captain Mannix, tell the nigger
that I don't acknowledge niggers
in Northern uniforms.
WARREN: You captured a whole colored command
that day...
but not one colored trooper
made it to a camp, did they?
We didn't have the time or the food...
nor the inclination...
to care for Northern horses
and least of all...
Northern niggers!
So we shot 'em where they stood!
OSWALDO: Gentlemen.
Gentlemen.
I know Americans aren't apt
to let a little thing
like unconditional surrender
get in the way of a good war.
But I strongly suggest we don't restage
the Battle of Baton Rouge
during a blizzard in Minnie's Haberdashery.
Now, uh...
my Nubian friend...
while I realize passions are high,
that was a while ago.
And if you shoot this unarmed old man,
I guarantee I will hang you by the neck
until you are dead
once we arrive in Red Rock.
I damn well guarantee that, too.
JOHN: Yeah, Warren,
that's the problem with old men.
You can kick 'em down the stairs
and say it's a accident,
but you can't just shoot 'em.
OSWALDO: Uh, gentlemen... since we may be
trapped here,
close together-like,
for a few days,
may I suggest a possible solution?
We divide Minnie's in half.
The Northern side
and the Southern side.
With the dinner table...
operating as a...
neutral territory.
We could say that the fireplace...
side of the room acts as a...
a symbolic representative of...
Georgia.
While the bar...
represents...
Philadelphia!
Long as the bar's Philadelphia...
I agree.
We still got that deal
we talked about in the wagon?
- O.B.: Thank you.
- I help you protect your $8,000,
- you help me protect my ten?
- Yeah, I suppose.
One of them fellas
is not what he says he is.
O.B.: What is he?
In cahoots with this one, that's what he is.
One of them, maybe even two of them,
is here to see Domergue goes free.
To accomplish that goal,
they'll kill everybody in here.
They got 'em a couple of days,
so all they got to do is sit tight
and wait for a window of opportunity.
And that's when they strike.
Huh, bitch?
If you say so, John.
Are you sure you ain't just being paranoid?
Our best bet is this duplicitous fella
ain't as cool a customer as Daisy here.
He won't have the leather patience it takes
to just sit here and... wait.
-
- Waiting for an opportunity
and knowing it's the right one isn't so easy.
He can't handle it, he'll stop waitin'.
Try and create his opportunity,
and that's when Mr. Jumpy reveals himself.
WARREN: Now, what you got
to say about all this?
What do I got to say?
About John Ruth's ravings?
: He's absolutely right.
:
Me and one of them fellas is in cahoots.
We're just waiting
for everybody to go to sleep.
: That's when
we're gonna kill y'all.
JOHN: Okay, everybody.
JOHN: Hear this.
This here is Daisy Domergue.
She's wanted dead or alive for murder.
$10,000.
That money's mine, boys.
Don't want to share it,
and I ain't gonna lose it.
When that sun comes out,
I'm taking this woman into Red Rock to hang.
Now...
is there anybody here
committed to stoppin' me...
from doing that?
JOHN: Really?
Nobody got a problem with this?
Well...
I guess that's very fortunate for me.
However...
I hope you all understand
I can't just...
take your word.
Circumstances force me to...
take...
precautions.
When you say...
"precautions"...
why do I feel that you mean me?
Because I'm gonna take your gun, son.
You are?
Yes, I am.
- Nothing personal.
- Just mine?
Hangman's got himself a gun, too.
I'll be dealing with his gun
after I deal with yours.
-
-
I feel kind of...
naked without it.
JOHN: Oh, I still got mine.
I'll protect you.
A bastard's work is never done.
Huh, John Ruth?
That's right, Joe Gage.
- Now, give me the gun.
- If you want it...
you're gonna have to come and take...
Calm down.
Take your hand away from your gun.
Blink if you're calm.
He blink?
He blinked.
Blink if you're gonna remain calm.
He blinked.
Take his pistol.
I'm real sorry about this, son.
: Like I said...
nothing personal, just...
a precaution.
-
-
Pretty sneaky.
Afraid the same applies to you, too,
Mr.... Mobray.
Ah, precautions must be taken
because life is too sweet to lose.
Hand me that little bucket.
O.B.
Go to the outhouse.
Take this bucket and...
dump it down the shithole.
Why do I got to go outside?
Well, your jacket's already on,
and I sorta kinda trust you.
- JOHN: Grab the other cup.
- DOMERGUE: Yeah, I got it.
After you, Major.
Okay.
I'm gonna cut you loose while we eat.
Don't get any ideas.
I ain't goin' soft on ya.
Lift your ass even one inch off that seat,
and I'll put a bullet
right in your goddamn throat.
Come here.
Oh.
So, Domergue...
I suppose this blizzard
counts as a stroke of luck
far as you're concerned.
You don't hear me complainin', do ya?
No, I sure don't.
Well, how 'bout you, Oswaldo?
How 'bout me what?
Look...
considering all the things I done for money,
I ain't one to judge, but...
don't you feel just the least little bad
about hangin' a woman?
Well, until they invent
a trigger a woman can't pull,
if you're a hangman,
you're going to hang women.
Well, hell, Ozzie, I guess I ain't
never looked at it like that before.
When it comes to some of them
mean bastards out there,
it's the only thing does the job.
You really only need to hang mean bastards.
But mean bastards, you need to hang.
O.B.: You goddamn son of a bitch!
I almost died out there!
I ain't ever... going out in that shit
ever, ever again!
-
-
-
-
You okay, O.B.?
I'm fine.
I'll be fine.
I just need to get warm.
You want some stew, O.B.?
Stew?
: Later.
O.B.: Oh, yeah.
O.B.: That's nice.
So...
how you doing, Black Major?
I ain't in the mood, Chris Mannix.
Leave me be from your horseshit.
John Ruth says you got a Lincoln letter.
I told you, jackass,
go hee-haw someplace else.
That's right, John.
You did say that, didn't you?
Yeah. I did.
So...
you got a letter from Abraham Lincoln?
Yes.
The... Abraham Lincoln?
Yes.
Abraham Lincoln?
The president of the United States?
Yes.
Of America?
Yes.
Wrote you a letter...
personally?
Yes.
Personally, as in "Dear Major Warren"?
No, personally, as in "Dear Marquis."
"Dear Marquis"?
Abraham Lincoln, the president
of the United States of America?
Yes.
May I see it?
No, you may not.
But the way John tells it, you weren't
just some random nigger soldier
picked from a pile of letters.
Way John tells it...
y'all had a correspondence.
Yes.
The way John tells it...
y'all was practically pen pals.
Yes.
And a pen pal's...
practically a friend.
John Ruth...
you really think a nigger,
drummed out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down his back,
was practically friends
with the president of
the United States of America?
John Ruth, I hate to be the one
to break it to you,
but ain't nobody in Minnie's
Haberdashery ever corresponded
with Abraham Lincoln.
Least of all, that nigger there!
Was all that horseshit?
Course it was.
DOMERGUE: Good one, Warren!
Talk that sass, nigger!
Talk that sass!
Well, I guess it's true
what they say about you people.
Can't trust a fuckin' word
comes out of your mouth.
What's the matter, John Ruth?
I hurt your feelings?
As a matter of fact...
you did.
-
-
I know...
I'm the only black son of a
bitch you ever conversed with,
so I'm gonna cut you some slack.
But you got no idea what it's like
being a black man facin' down America.
Only time black folks is safe
is when white folks is disarmed.
And this letter had the desired effect
of disarmin' white folks.
Call it what you want.
I call it a dirty fuckin' trick.
You want to know why I lie
about somethin' like that, white man?
Got me on that stagecoach, didn't it?
Well, I'll tell you
like the good Lord told John.
A letter from Abraham Lincoln
wouldn't have had
that kind of effect on me.
I might let a whore piss on it.
- DOMERGUE: I spit on it.
- CHRIS: Good for you, sister!
Warren.
Goddamn it, you leave that old man alone.
WARREN: Stand down, you son of a bitch.
I shared a battlefield with this man.
Or would you deny me that, too?
I suppose you were there.
May I join you?
Yes, you may.
: Damn it.
So, how's life since the war?
Got both my legs.
Both my arms.
I can't complain.
Got a woman?
Fever took her start of this last winter.
WARREN: Mm.
What was her name?
Betsy.
Georgia gal?
Augusta.
Atlanta boy, Augusta girl.
I used to raise Kentucky horses.
And her pa was the owner of the breedership
where I bought most of my ponies.
Goddamn it.
I made a good deal on her.
-
- Took the stake he gave me
and bought a bunch of peach orchards.
Set myself up pretty well.
Did a hell of a lot better
than either one of my no-good
brothers, that's for damn sure.
Hmm.
Yeah, your boy come up here a few years back.
He spoke highly of his mama, too.
You knew my boy?
Did I know him?
Yep.
Yeah, I knew him.
You did not know my boy.
Suit yourself.
Did you know my son?
-
- I know the day he died.
- Do you?
- No.
Do you want to know what day that was?
Yes.
The day...
he met me.
WARREN: He come up here
to do a little nigger head-huntin'.
By then, the reward was, oh...
$5,000 and braggin' rights.
But to battle-hard rebs,
$5,000 just to cut off a nigger's head?
: That's good money.
So them Johnnies climbed this mountain,
lookin' for fortune.
There wasn't no fortune to be found.
All they found...
was me.
All them crackers come up here
sang a different tune
when they found theyself
at the mercy of a nigger's gun.
Let's just forget it.
I'll go my way, you go your'n.
That's your boy Chester talkin'.
You're a goddamn lie!
WARREN : "If you just let me
go home "to my family, I swear...
I'll never set foot in Wyoming again."
That's what they all said.
Beggin' for his life...
your boy told me
his whole life story.
And you...
was in that story, General.
-
- And when I knew me I had
the son...
of the Bloody Nigger Killer of Baton Rouge...
I knew me
I was gonna have some fun.
You shut your lyin' nigger lips up!
General Smithers, don't you listen to him.
He didn't know your boy.
He just heard tell why you're here, is all.
It was cold the day I killed your boy.
: And I don't mean
snowy-mountain-Wyoming cold, uh-uh.
-
- It was colder than that.
And on that cold day, with your boy
at the business end of my gun barrel,
I made him strip...
right down to his bare ass.
Then I told him to start walkin'.
I walked his naked ass for two hours
'fore the cold collapsed him.
You never even knew my boy?
CHRIS: No, he didn't!
He's just a sneaky nigger trying
to get you to go for that gun.
WARREN: Then...
he commenced to beggin' again.
But this time, he wasn't beggin' to go home.
Ah, he knew
he'd never see his home again.
He wasn't beggin' for his life, neither,
'cause he knew that was long gone.
All he wanted...
was a blanket.
Now, don't judge your boy too
harshly, General.
You ain't never been cold
as your boy was that day.
You'd be surprised
what a man that cold
would do for a blanket.
You want to know what your boy did?
I pulled my big black pecker
out of my pants...
and I made him crawl through the snow
on all fours over to it.
: Then I grabbed me
a handful of that black hair
at the back of his head...
and I stuck my big black johnson
right down his goddamn throat.
And it was full of blood,
so it was warm.
Oh, you bet your sweet ass it was warm.
And Chester Charles Smithers
sucked on that warm black dingus
for long as he could!
You're startin' to see pictures, ain't ya?
Your boy...
black dude's dingus in his mouth...
him shakin', him cryin',
me laughin'...
and him not understandin'.
But you understand, don't you, Sandy?
I never did give your boy that blanket...
even after all he did,
and he did everything I asked.
No blanket.
That blanket was just a
heart-breakin' liar's promise.
Kind of like those uniforms
the Union issued those colored troops
that you chose not to acknowledge.
So what you gonna do, old man? Hmm?
You gonna spend the next two, three days
ignorin' the nigger that killed your boy?
Ignorin' how I made him suffer?
Ignoring how I made him...
lick... all over my johnson?
Oh, the dumbest thing your boy ever did
was to let me know...
he was your boy.
NARRATOR: About 15 minutes has past
since we last left our characters.
Joe Gage volunteered to take
Smithers' dead body outside.
Straws were drawn to see who'd help him.
O.B. lost.
Chris, John Ruth and Oswaldo
had a vigorous debate
about the legality of the self-defense
murder that just transpired.
Major Marquis Warren,
who was supremely confident
about the legality of what just transpired,
ignored them, sat at the table by himself
and drank brandy.
Captain Chris Mannix donned
the dead general's coat
and joined Oswaldo in lighting
the candles and lanterns.
Hey, Ozzie!
Now, you got the right idea.
Let's light this place up.
NARRATOR: John Ruth held the door closed,
waiting for Joe Gage and O.B. to return.
Bob enjoyed a Manzana Roja.
Domergue, however, hasn't moved from her spot
at the community dinner table
since John Ruth uncuffed her.
John Ruth.
JOHN: Yeah.
Can I play that guitar over there?
NARRATOR: Let's go back a bit.
Your boy, black dude's dingus in his mouth.
NARRATOR: 15 minutes ago, Major Warren
shot General Smithers in front of everybody.
But about 40 seconds before that,
something equally as important happened,
but not everybody saw it.
While Major Warren was captivating the crowd
with tales of black dicks in white mouths,
somebody...
poisoned the coffee.
WARREN: He did everything I asked.
No blanket.
NARRATOR:
And the only one to see him do it...
was Domergue.
That's why this chapter is called
"Domergue's Got a Secret."
John Ruth.
JOHN: Yeah.
Can I play that guitar over there?
Yeah.
You come back with
anything else but a guitar,
my pistol plays a tune.
"Domergue's Death March."
You got it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.
Listen for a moment, lads
And hear me tell my tale
O'er the sea from England shore
I was condemned to sail
Jury found me guilty, sir
And said the judge, said he
For life, Jim Jones
I sentence you across the stormy sea
Have no chance of mischief there
Remember what I say
They'll flog the poaching out of you
-  Out there in Botany Bay
-
Waves were high upon the sea
The winds approaching gales
I'd rather drowned in misery
Than come to New South Wales
The waves were high upon the sea
When the pirates came along
But the soldiers on our convict ship
Were full 500 strong
They opened fire and somehow drove
That pirate ship away
I'd rather join that pirate ship
Than gone to Botany Bay
And one dark night
When everything is quiet in the town
I'll kill you bastards one and all
I'll gun the floggers down
Give them all a little shock
Remember what I say
Yet regret they sent Jim Jones
In chains to Botany Bay.
That's the one you like to sing
in the stagecoach, huh?
Yeah.
It's kinda pretty.
Got another verse to it?
Yeah, lots.
Well, go ahead, sing it.
Whatever you say, John.
Now day and night the irons clang
And like poor galley slaves
We toil and toil and when we die
Must fill dishonored graves
By and by I'll break my chains
And to the bush I'll go
And you'll be dead behind me, John
When I get to Mexico.
Give me that guitar.
Music time's over!
DOMERGUE: Wha... Hey!
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Whoa!
Turn around!
John, no!
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Shut up!
When you get to hell, John,
tell 'em Daisy sent ya.
Mannix, the coffee!
-
- CHRIS: Oh, my God!
Oh! Aah!
WARREN: Give me that fucking gun.
Don't test me, bitch.
Everybody!
Get your backsides up against
that back wall over yonder.
Well, goddamn it!
Get or don't get, Joe Gage.
It's up to you.
- I'm gettin'.
- Then get!
You, too, Senor Bob.
Everybody turn around
and put your hands on that wall.
Move them damn snowshoes!
Everybody keep your mouths shut.
Do like I say.
You open your mouth, you gonna get a bullet.
Move a little sudden, a little strange,
you gonna get a bullet.
Not a warnin', not a question.
A bullet.
You got that?
Let me hear you say, "I got it!"
- I got it.
- I got it.
I got it.
We have it.
Chris Mannix, come over here on this side.
Come on.
Take this gun out my holster.
: Point it at them.
Now, like I said,
anybody does anything,
and I mean anything,
you kill 'em.
So...
you finally decided I'm tellin' the truth
about bein' the sheriff of Red Rock, huh?
I don't know about all that.
But I know you ain't the killer
poisoned that coffee,
'cause you almost drunk it
your own damn self.
One of them is.
Aah!
Ow!
Give me the key. Give me the key!
You motherfucking black bastard!
You're gonna die on this mountain,
and I'm gonna fucking laugh when you do!
WARREN: What'd I say 'bout talkin'?
: Bastard.
Meant it, didn't I?
And you need to understand
you just killed the only man here
committed to gettin' you to Red Rock alive.
Now, one of y'all...
is workin' with her.
Or two of y'all is workin' with her.
Or all y'all is.
But only one of you poisoned the coffee.
Now, what charms this bitch got
make a man brave a blizzard,
kill in cold blood?
I'm sure I don't know.
But John Ruth's tryin' to hang your woman.
So you kill him.
Okay.
Maybe.
But O.B. wasn't hangin' nobody.
He damn sure wasn't.
But he sure enough layin' over there
dead now, though, ain't he?
He damn sure is, you sons of bitches.
Just like any one of us
would've drunk that coffee.
Like me, goddamn it.
Now, those of y'all
with your hands on the wall
don't practice in poison
need to think about that.
Think about how it could've been you
rollin' around here on this floor.
And how the man standin' next
to you would be responsible.
And I know who I got my money on.
Oh, that's right, Joe Gage.
I'm lookin' at you.
Not so fast, Chris.
We'll get there.
Let's slow it down.
Let's slow it way down.
Who made the coffee?
He did.
Yeah, he did, didn't he?
Yeah, he did, didn't he?
But it's the stew that's got me thinkin'.
Now, how long you said Minnie been gone?
A week?
Si.
See...
my mama used to make stew,
and it always tasted the same,
no matter the meat.
And there was another fellow
on the plantation,
Uncle Charly.
He made stew, too.
And like my mama,
I ate his stew from the time I was a whipper
till I was a full-grown man.
No matter the meat,
it always tasted like Uncle Charly's stew.
Now, I ain't had Minnie's stew
in six months, so I ain't no expert.
But that damn sure is...
Minnie's stew.
So if Minnie is on the north side
visitin' her mama for a week,
how'd she make the stew this mornin'?
CHRIS: Hmm.
And this...
this is Sweet Dave's chair.
When I sat in it earlier,
: I couldn't believe it.
Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chair.
Uh, this may be Minnie's place,
but this is damn sure
Sweet Dave's chair.
And if he went to the north side...
I'm pretty goddamn sure
this chair be goin' with him.
What's in the chair?
Just what I thought.
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.
Hoo!
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
So, are you actually accusing me of murder?
Way I see it, Senor Bob,
is whoever is workin' with her
ain't who they say they is.
And if it's you,
that means Minnie and her man
ain't at her mama's.
They layin' out back there dead somewhere.
Or if it's you, little British man,
the real Oswaldo Mobray layin'
in a ditch somewhere
and you just a English fella
passin' off his papers.
CHRIS: Or we go by my theory,
which is the ugliest guy did it.
Which makes it you, Joe Gage.
So I take it you deduced
the coffee was poisoned
while you were murdering the old man?
Yes.
Well, mi negro amigo,
during that whole incident,
I was sitting on that side of the room
playing "Silent Night" on the piano.
Oh, I ain't say you poisoned the coffee.
I said you didn't make the stew.
My theory is...
you workin' with the man
who poisoned the coffee,
and both of y'all murdered Minnie,
Sweet Dave and whoever else
picked this bad-luck day
to visit Minnie's Haberdashery this mornin'.
And at some point, y'all intended
to bushwhack John Ruth
and free Daisy.
But you didn't count on the blizzard,
and you didn't count on the two of us.
CHRIS: Hmm.
That's far as I got. How am I doing?
You're a real imaginative nigger,
- ain't you?
-
So, do you intend to murder me
based on a far-fetched nigger theory,
or can you prove it, cabron?
It ain't so far-fetched, Senor Bob.
And it's a little bit more than a theory.
How long you say you been workin' for Minnie?
Four months.
Mmm.
See, if you'd have been here
two and a half years ago,
you'd know 'bout that sign
used to hang up over the bar.
Minnie mention that to you?
No.
You want to know what
that sign said, Senor Bob?
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed."
Now, Minnie hung that sign up
the day she opened this haberdashery.
And it hung over that bar every day
till she took it down
a little over two years ago.
You know why she took it down?
She started lettin' in dogs.
Now, Minnie liked just about everybody,
but she sure don't
like Mexicans.
So when you tell me
Minnie went to the north side
to visit her mama,
well, I find that highly unlikely.
But okay, maybe.
But when you tell me
Minnie Mink took the haberdashery,
the most precious thing to her
in the whole world,
and left it in the hands
of a goddamn Mexican?
Well, that's what I meant in the barn
when I said that sure
don't sound like Minnie.
Now I am calling you a liar,
Senor Bob.
And if you lyin',
which you are...
then you killed Minnie.
- And Sweet Dave.
-
Four measly bullets,
and there goes Senor Bob.
But that still don't get us no closer
to which one of y'all
poisoned the coffee, though.
Do it, Chris?
CHRIS: No, it sure don't.
Now, one of y'all poisoned this coffee
to free Daisy.
If I don't hear a confession
from one of you motherfuckers
quick, fast and in a hurry,
I'm gonna pour this whole pot of coffee
down that bitch's goddamn throat.
Okay. Time's up.
JOE: Stop!
All right, I did it.
It was me. I poisoned the coffee.
I fuckin' knew it!
Oh!
You gonna die now, you murderin' bastard!
Major Warren, please let me send this ugly
son of a bitch to hell.
You killed O.B.
He was worth ten of you.
Warren, can I kill him?
Say adios to your huevos.
: Major Warren!
: I ain't got no gun,
Sheriff.
- WOMAN: Roy!
-
Good boy.
Get up!
Get up there!
Get up!
Packer, Roy, get up!
Get up!
- Get up there! Get up!
-
Get up!
Get up there! Get up!
Get up!
MAN: Go!
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Go!
Get up. Get up.
-  Hyah! Get up! Get up!
- Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
MAN: Get up!
WOMAN: Get up!
Get up! Get up!
- Whoa!
- Easy.
- Whoa.
- Whoa!
Whoa. Hey, Charly, my boy.
How the hell are you?
Hiya, Ed. Hiya, Judy.
Yeah!
Ah.
How many you got?
Full house today, friend.
Got one in there waitin'.
Well, he's gonna have to keep on waitin'.
We ain't got no room.
Well, you need to tell Minnie.
'Cause he been here two days,
and Minnie wants him out of here.
Well, I can't give him a seat I don't have.
Listen, why don't you take
the passengers inside
and introduce 'em to Minnie,
warm yourself up and drink some coffee.
Yeah.
Here we are, everybody.
Minnie's Haberdashery.
Step outside, you and your friends
can stretch your legs.
When you're ready, step on inside, get
warm by the fire, get some coffee in you.
I'll introduce you to Minnie.
Hiya, Minnie!
JUDY: Now, Minnie, I'm not tryin' to tell you
how to run your business,
but I would think coffee
- would be the first thing you'd make.
- Hmm.
Come on in, everybody. Don't be shy.
Hats!
Everybody, this is Minnie,
and this is her place.
Behind me, pluckin' that chicken, is Gemma.
Ah.
Lovely smile, that Gemma.
Now, the fella in the uniform I don't know,
but the one he's playing chess
with is Sweet Dave.
Hiya, Dave.
- Hey, Judy.
-
And, Minnie, these are the passengers.
Well, that's not good enough.
Go on, take away them rags,
let's see some faces, let's hear some names.
Oswaldo Mobray, madam.
Joe Gage.
Bob.
And I'm Jody.
It's a pleasant surprise
to find such a warm sanctuary
in the middle of such a cold hell.
Well, make yourself comfortable.
Get warm by the fire.
Uh, we're just gonna go warm ourselves
by the stove, if that's all right.
Oh, stove, fireplace, whatever.
Just get warm.
Oh, and Judy said somethin'
about the best coffee in the world.
Ah, yes. I do believe Judy did say something
about the best coffee in the world.
Well, I don't know about all that,
but I tell you what it is.
It's hot, it's strong, and it's good.
And in this here snow,
it sure enough warms your ass up.
You don't need to sell it,
Minnie, you need to make it.
And you need to get your ass out there
and help Charly with them bags
and get Ed in here.
Yes, ma'am.
- But fix that coffee.
- I'll fix you!
I don't know, some old man.
Well, I don't know what
I'm supposed to do about it.
I'm just telling you what she said.
Anyway, she sent me out here to help Charly.
- She wants to talk to you.
-
Charly, you got a hold of these fellas?
Got 'em, Ed.
Miss Minnie, would you roll me a cigarette?
Sure, honey.
I smoke Red Apple tobacco.
That all right?
That's my favorite.
Don't mind me, gentlemen.
I'm just watching.
You play?
You know, I must have had at least 12 people
teach me that goddamn game.
Just never could keep the moves in my head.
But if I'm not disturbing, I'd like to watch.
Hell no. I like whippin' this old man's
ass in front of a audience.
-
- You ain't whippin' shit!
Merci beaucoup, Mademoiselle Minnie.
Oh, that's real nice.
What is that?
That's French.
You speak French?
Oui.
"Oui"? What does that mean?
It means "yes."
Oui, yes.
Hey, hey, Dave, ask me if my ass is fat.
What?
Ask me if my ass is fat.
It is.
I said ask me.
Why?
Just do it!
Is your ass fat?
Oui.
Look at that, y'all, I can speak French.
Are you the, uh,
jelly bean salesman around here?
How many peppermint sticks
I get for a nickel?
Five.
All right.
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sugar.
GEMMA : Okay.
Uh, allow me to assist you, madam.
I'm bringing in your bags
in case anybody wants to change
your clothes before Red Rock.
Oh.
Peppermint stick?
Thanks.
So why do they call you
"Six-Horse Judy" anyway?
'Cause I'm the only Judy you've ever
seen that can drive a six-horse team.
Oh, yeah.
Kind of a stupid question.
Do you mind holding this for me?
Ah...
rock steady, madam.
Rock steady.
You got a very sweet little accent.
Where's that from, England?
I take exception to that.
- JUDY: New Zealand.
- Careful, madam. Precarious.
JOE: Is that anywhere near, uh, Old Zealand?
MINNIE: Mmm.
JOE: Auckland?
What the fuck's an Auckland?
JUDY: It's where I'm from.
It's our biggest city.
- Coffee!
- Mm-hmm.
Coffee's ready.
Well, it's about damn time!
Best coffee on the mountain.
MINNIE: Oh, I don't know about all that.
Stagecoach drivers like it,
passengers not so much.
Most find it a mite too strong.
Can't be too strong on this mountain.
-
- Thank you.
MINNIE: Well?
What do you think?
-
-
Shit, fuck!
Shit!
BOB: Yep.
- JODY: Mmm, si.
- BOB: He adds something.
Not much, but something.
What you think, Pete?
Well, I must admit, he does make
the setup more convincing.
JODY: Hmm.
Okay.
I'll talk to the old man.
You three collect the bodies
and chuck 'em in that well out there.
And then start unhitchin' the horses
and gettin' 'em in the barn
and gettin' 'em fed.
PETE: Well, hang on. I mean, puttin'
the horses away, that's easy enough,
but draggin' these fat bastards up and down
the mountain, that's fuckin' impossible.
- JODY: Okay.
-
JODY: Well, this is a store,
so there's gotta be
a wheelbarrow around here somewhere.
Start with the horses,
and as soon as I get through
with this old hickory tree,
I'll come out and help you, okay?
BOB: Hey, Pete, grab my coat, will ya?
Now
You're all
Alone
Feelin'
That nobody wants you
And you're looking
For someone
To hold your hand
-  Someone
-
Who understands
Now
You're by yourself
And you're feelin'
The world close
In on you
And you're askin'...
Look.
I just started workin' here.
Whatever Minnie did to make y'all mad...
I had nothin' to do with it.
Someone...
-
-
JODY: Hmm.
Well, old man.
If you...
was a cat,
what just happened here
would count as one of your nine lives.
Do you realize how close you came
to being tossed on a pile of niggers?
-  Yes.
- Yeah.
And when it comes to that pile
of niggers that we buildin' out back,
won't take nothin' to make you general of it.
You believe that?
I expect no less.
Not so fast, old man.
You might have a way out of this yet.
Later today,
dirty...
son of a gun
is gonna come in here...
and he's gonna have my sister with him.
And he is gonna have her in chains.
He's taking her to Red Rock to be hung.
Do you know why?
No.
$10,000.
That's why.
Now, when he gets here,
I'm gonna kill that fella
and turn my sister loose.
Now, do you have any reason
why you would want to interfere
with me saving my sister
from a hangman's rope?
No.
You don't?
No, I don't.
You sure you don't?
I mean, we did just kill
Minnie and Sweet Dave.
Now, you and Sweet Dave looked
mighty chummy over here.
I just met these people!
I don't give a damn about them!
Or you. Or your sister.
Or any other son of a bitch
in Wyoming, for that matter.
That is a good answer,
old man.
Now, when they get here,
you just sit your ass in this chair,
and you don't do nothin'.
You don't say nothin'.
"Hello."
"Thank you."
"Good night."
That's about it.
Maybe your name.
But that's it.
"Hello."
"Thank you."
"Good night."
- And maybe my name.
- Maybe your name.
Mm-hmm, be a, be a old man.
Be dotty.
Go to sleep.
And don't you say nothin',
and I mean nothin',
to that bounty hunter that's got my sister.
Do you understand?
Yes.
When it's safe, I'll kill him,
free my sister
and leave you be.
Deal?
Deal.
Thank you.
NARRATOR: During the next four hours,
Jody and the boys chucked
the bodies down the well...
put away the horses...
tidied up around Minnie's...
stashed weapons for further use...
and waited for John Ruth
and Daisy's stage to arrive.
All right, boys.
This is it.
Let's get ready.
Now, remember, it doesn't matter
if we have four men or 40,
we are still gonna be facing
John Ruth chained to my sister
with a pistol pointed at her belly.
Now, killin' that fella 'fore he kills
my sister ain't gonna be easy,
but you better believe that's
exactly what we gonna do.
So the name of the game here is patience.
Trapped here for two or three days,
at some point he will close his eyes.
And that's when you blow
the top of his head off.
Remember, old man.
If my sister don't make it
off of this mountain alive,
neither do you.
I'll do my best.
O.B. : Whoa, whoa, easy.
Whoa. Whoa.
Good luck, mate.
BOB: What the hell is going on?
We weren't expecting another stage tonight!
- O.B.: Yeah, I can see you
- PETE: Here.
...already got another one up in here.
PETE: No.
BOB: Just got through
puttin' the horses away!
O.B.: Well, this ain't the normal line.
But we are stuck on
the wrong side of a blizzard,
so it looks like you're stuck with us.
PETE: Now you gotta do another one.
O.B.: Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?
BOB: They ain't here!
I'm running the place while they're gone.
JOHN: Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?
O.B.: He says they ain't here.
He's looking after the place
while they're gone.
JOHN: Who are you?
BOB: I'm Bob.
JOHN: Well, whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.
Get 'em out of this cold
'fore that blizzard hits us.
BOB: Whoa. You all right?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Esperate, esperate, esperate!
I just put those other horses away.
You need it done fast, you need to help.
JOHN: I got two of my best men on it.
You heard him, freeloaders.
Get to work.
BOB: All right, you two, unhook the leaders.
Come on, let's go!
-
- JOHN: Open up!
- You have to kick it open!
- Ya gotta kick it open!
- DOMERGUE: What?
- Kick it open!
CHRIS: How you doin', old boy?
They shot my nuts off.
I'm freezin', burnin' up the same time.
Bleedin' like a stuck pig.
I think I'm gonna die.
And these motherfuckers did it.
That's how I'm doin'.
How you doin'?
Well, my leg hurts really bad.
But I think, if I put all
my weight on my right foot...
I was just bein' sarcastic.
I don't give a fuck about your leg.
CHRIS: Huh.
Now, you just...
make yourself comfortable.
Don't worry about my comfort.
Shit, I can't feel my ass no more.
-
- Worry about these owl hoots
and that bushwhackin'
nut shooter in the basement.
All right!
You... fella in the basement!
You either give up
by the time I count to three...
or I shoot Domergue in the head.
One!
Two!
JODY: No, no, no, no,
don't shoot her in the head!
I'm coming up.
Hold on now, you bushwhackin' sack shooter!
You just open the door.
We tell you when to come up.
Now throw out your pistol.
Toward the bed.
Bet he got another.
Now throw out your other pistol.
JODY: I ain't got another pistol!
Well, you better shit
another pistol out your ass,
'cause if you don't throw one up here
in the next two seconds,
we gonna kill this bitch.
See?
Told you.
Now, with your hands where we can see 'em,
slowly come on up.
How you doing, dummy?
Better, now I see your ugly face.
How you like that?
You bushwhackin' castrator!
What are you doing? He was giving up!
It took him too long, so I done it for him.
Joe Gage, get your ass over
here and shut this trap door.
I'm sorry, honey.
May I sit in a chair?
Yes, you may.
Keep your hands flat on that table.
And don't move 'em.
DOMERGUE: Mannix!
You sure picked the wrong time
to turn into a nigger lover.
Don't you see, that nigger and John Ruth
put you smack dab in the middle of danger?
You're about to be murdered
in some nigger named Minnie's house,
and you don't even know why!
Okay... bitch.
I'll bite.
Why?
I'm working with all three of them fellas.
But not 'cause they got
butterflies in their belly
about me, but because we're all gang members.
The Jody Domingre Gang.
That fella y'all just killed in the basement
was Jody Domingre!
My brother!
Well, who the hell is Jody Domingre?
You want to tell him, bounty man?
He was a big bad cat worth $50,000.
And every member of his gang
was worth at least ten.
Which finally explains why you worth ten.
And what's gonna happen when
that sun comes out, nigger?
So is my brother's 15 men
coming straight here for us.
Tell him, Grouch!
Jody got 15 men waiting in Red Rock.
We couldn't kill John Ruth
and free Daisy here,
their job was to sack the town,
kill John Ruth
and free Daisy there.
Now, with my brother dead,
I'm in charge of this gang.
- Right, boys?
- That's right, Daisy.
Oh, yeah.
And, Chris, I am telling you,
you ain't done anything yet
that we can't forgive.
So, let's make a deal.
No deals, bitch.
You gonna let that nigger
speak for you, Chris?
Hold it, Warren.
Seeing as how she ain't got nothing to sell,
I'm kinda curious about her sales pitch.
Humor me.
All right... bitch.
What's... your... deal?
Easy.
Take your gun, shoot that nigger dead.
Then we sit here all nice-like
for the next two days.
When the snow melts, we go to
Mexico, you go on to Red Rock,
get that star pinned on your chest.
Hey, Pete. How much can we pay him?
Well, we could give him Marco.
Bob's real name is Marco the Mexican.
He's worth $12,000.
WARREN: That's Marco the Mexican?
Precisely, yeah.
: Shit.
Now that I blowed his face off,
Marco ain't worth a peso.
: Oh!
Oh, sh... Oh, sh...
PETE: Well, then, if I die
in the next two days,
which is more than likely, you can have me.
Under the name of English Pete Hicox,
I got a federal bounty of $15,000 on my head.
It's all yours, Chris.
WARREN: You keep talking, Pete,
you gonna talk yourself to death.
Joe Gage, who you be?
Grouch Douglass.
You heard of him?
Yeah, I heard of Grouch Douglass.
He worth ten, just like Daisy.
Well, remind me...
why we wouldn't just kill all y'all, cash in.
Oh, you can kill us all,
but you'll never spend a cent
of that bounty money,
and you'll never leave this mountain alive.
'Cause when that snow melts,
the rest of Jody's gang,
all 15 of 'em that are waiting
in Red Rock, are coming here.
Now, let's say you shoot us all.
If you really want all that
Domingre Gang bounty money,
you still got to get
all our corpses into Red Rock.
And that ain't gonna be so easy.
'Cause I doubt you can drive
a four-horse team.
And that wagon out there is
too heavy for a two-horse team.
So that means you're gonna have to lead
a string of horses into Red Rock.
And with that deep snow after a blizzard,
you ain't gonna be able
to get away with any more than,
say, one body per horse.
So that's you leading a string
of four horses into Red Rock.
And with all them horses in that snow
and you all by your lonesome,
you're gonna be a mite poky.
And you're gonna run smack dab
into the Domingre Gang.
And again, Grouch, how many is that?
JOE: 15 killers strong.
And when those 15 killers come across you
in possession of all our dead bodies,
they ain't just gonna
kill you and that nigger!
They gonna go back to Red Rock
and kill every son of a bitch in that town!
You really the sheriff of Red Rock?
You want to save the town?
Then shoot that nigger dead!
Jesus Christ!
WARREN: Oh, ho, ho!
You believe in Jesus now, huh, bitch?
Well, good, 'cause you about to meet him.
Anybody else want to make a deal? Huh?
PETE: The deal still stands, Chris.
You ain't done nothing we can't forgive.
It's all still on that nigger.
You shoot him dead, take my body,
- sit out in the snow with Daisy and Grou...
-
You cunt!
WARREN : Mannix,
give me my pistol.
Give it here!
Give it here!
So, you were saying...
we sit here, all nice and friendly like,
for the next two days.
Then the snow melts, you leave here,
meet up with your gang,
and hightail it to Mexico.
That's the deal, right?
Yeah.
And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?
Yeah.
But Jody's worth $50,000.
What about his body?
: You gonna make a deal
with this diabolical bitch?
I ain't saying
I'm gonna make a deal with her.
We just talking.
Calm down!
So what about Jody's body and the $50,000?
DOMERGUE: You're getting greedy, reb.
No deal.
We're taking Jody's body back with us.
He got children.
So I kill Warren, and we all friends?
Yeah.
No deal, tramp.
DOMERGUE: Chris!
You're making the biggest
mistake of your life!
When our boys get here in a couple of days,
they're gonna cut your nuts off!
And there won't be a stick left
in that town unburnt!
Well, I guess I should be
plumb scared right now, huh?
If you had any brains, you would be!
You see...
here's the problem, Daisy.
In order for me to be scared of your threats,
I got to believe in
those 15 extra gang members
waiting it out in Red Rock.
And boy, oh, boy, I sure don't.
What I believe is,
Joe Gage or Grouch Douglass or
whatever the fuck his name was,
poisoned the coffee.
And you watched him do it.
And you watched me pour a cup,
and you didn't say shit!
And...
I believe you are what you've always been,
a lying bitch who will do anything
to cheat the rope
waiting for her in Red Rock,
including shitting out 15 extra gang members
- whenever you need be.
-
WARREN: Oh, oh!
And...
I believe, when it comes to what's left
of the Jody Domingre Gang,
I'm looking at 'em.
Right here, right now,
dead on this motherfucking floor!
Goddamn right.
Then you're gonna die
on this mountain, Chris.
'Cause my brother leads an army of men.
Horseshit!
My daddy led an army.
He led a renegade army,
fighting for a lost cause!
My daddy held up to 400 men
together after the war
with nothing but their respect
in his command!
Your brother's just an owl hoot
who led a gang of killers!
I don't feel so good.
Oh, shit.
Ha!
You still alive, white boy?
Fuck!
Mannix!
: Oh! Fuck!
WARREN: Hey, boy!
WARREN: Get up!
Chris Mannix!
If your ass ain't nailed
to the floor, wake the fuck up!
Wake up, white boy!
I ain't dead yet, you black bastard.
Chris Mannix, I may have misjudged you.
CHRIS: Now we've come
to the part of the story...
where I blow your goddamn head off.
No! No, no, don't shoot her!
Why the hell not?
John Ruth.
Now, John Ruth was
one mighty, mighty bastard.
But the last thing
that bastard did 'fore he died
was save your life.
We gonna die, white boy.
We ain't got no say in that.
But there is one thing left
we do have a say in.
And that's how we kill this bitch.
And I say shooting's too good for her.
John Ruth could've shot her
anywhere anytime along the way.
But John Ruth was The Hangman.
And when The Hangman catches you,
you don't die by no bullet.
When The Hangman catches you, you hang.
"You only need to hang mean bastards..."
Mm-hmm.
"but mean bastards, you need to hang."
As my first and final act
as the sheriff of Red Rock,
I sentence you, Domergue,
to hang by the neck until death!
WARREN: Hang on, Daisy.
I want to watch.
Now, that was a nice dance.
CHRIS : Oh.
That sure was pretty.
WARREN: Shit!
- Hey.
-
Can I see that Lincoln letter?
"Dear Marquis,
"I hope this letter finds you
"in good health and stead.
"I'm doing fine,
"although I wish there were
more hours in a day.
"There's just so much to do.
"Times are changing slowly but surely,
"and it's men like you
that will make a difference.
"Your military success
is a credit not only to you,
"but your race as well.
"I'm very proud every time
I hear news of you.
"We still have a long way to go,
"but hand in hand, I know we will get there.
"I just want to let you know
you're in my thoughts.
"Hopefully, our paths
will cross in the future.
"Until then, I remain your friend.
"Ole Mary Todd's calling,
"so I guess it must be time for bed.
Respectfully, Abraham Lincoln."
"Ole Mary Todd."
That's a nice touch.
Yeah.
Thanks.
