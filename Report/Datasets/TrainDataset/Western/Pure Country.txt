CROWD :
Dusty! Dusty! Dusty!
Let's do it!
When you hear twin fiddles
And a steel guitar
You're listening to the sound
Of the American heart
Brings a smile to your face
And a tear to your eye
Sing the rain on the
roof on a summer night
Where they still know
wrong from right
Sing the rain on the roof
On a summer night
Where they still know
wrong from right
If you're bad to your baby
You better think twice
Be there for her just
to make things right
Make her believe
Till there ain't a doubt in her mind
The women sure love
him, don't they?
Everybody loves him.
Yeah.
They sure do.
Yeah! Heh, heh. Yeah!
Give her the best of
What you've got to give
Thanks for the interview, Lula.
Tell Dusty I'll pick up the second
half in Shreveport, will you, please?
Absolutely. Bye.
Better baby your baby
With a love that's strong
Hold her and tell her
You'll never do wrong
Better baby your baby
'Cause if you don't
Better baby your baby
With a love that's strong
Hold her and tell her
You'll never do wrong
Look at them.
He could stand there and look
cross-eyed and they'd still scream.
- Did you play him my song?
- I told you I would.
When?
When the time is right.
And when will that be?
When I say.
Mm. I'll be in Dusty's bus...
if anybody wants me.
- I can do something about that.
- Ahh!
You bet I'm not
Where the side walk ends
WOMAN: Yeah, Dusty!
Whistles still blowing
But the train is gone
Ain't no wheels gonna take me
From my home
Where the sidewalk ends
And the road begins
We said goodbye on
a cold dark night
Where the side walk ends
And the road begins
I'm not afraid to go
You bet I'm not
Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot
Where the sidewalk
ends you left a lot
Where the sidewalk
ends you left a lot
God bless!
We're bringing him in. Get ready.
You killed them tonight, boss.
Yeah, great show. Better
than ever. Incredible sound.
SECURITY:
Come on, that's all. That's all.
What?
Heh. What?
You all right?
It's all that damn smoke.
LULA: It was a great show
tonight, don't you think?
Bobby Louis went on and
on about that interview.
Lula, Bobby Louis is a jerk.
LULA: We need him.
He's gonna give you good
publicity for your new record.
Hey, Earl and I wrote a really nice
song. We're thinking maybe...
we'd like to simplify the
arrangements on this new album.
That reminds me...
I got a new song I want you
to try out next few nights.
I think it's gonna
be your new single.
Come on, give a listen.
I just said I had some new
ideas for this album.
LULA: When he first
approached me, I said no...
but this song's really something.
- Who?
- Huh?
- Who?
- Oh, um...
Buddy Jackson.
Buddy Jackson?
With the road crew?
Yes. With the road crew.
Hey. I don't remember you being much
more than road crew when I found you.
Couldn't draw more than 20 people.
I had good taste then, didn't I?
Like a pony express
in the wild, wild west
And I can saddle up fast,
Get you there first class
You know your mail's gonna get to you
Come snow, rain, sleet or hail
'Cause I'm a top
flight, hold-you-tight
Get-you-there-by-daylight,
Do-you-right overnight male.
Ho! Hold it, now!
- Hold it!
- Come back here!
DUSTY: Buddy?
That's great. That's great.
- DUSTY: Thank you, man.
- That's not exactly what I had in mind.
- What's not?
- It just needs...
- It just needs more... More energy.
- More energy?
- See what I mean?
- More energy. More energy.
All right. What else?
Then we bring in the strings.
Bring in the horns.
It's gonna sound great.
We'll bring the strings
and the horns in.
- Accordion.
- DUSTY: Heh, heh, heh.
How about the accordion?
No accordion?
No accordion.
What else?
- That's it. It'll sound great.
- That's it?
- Thank you, man. We'll work on it.
- BUDDY: Go ahead, now.
Thank you so much.
- BUDDY: It'll sound great.
- DUSTY: Thanks a bunch.
Get him out of here.
Come over here. Come on.
Come on. I want to talk to you.
Whoo. What a nerd.
DUSTY : Let me be your mailman
And I'll always come through
There's no denyin',
Come rain or shine
I do things by the letter,
You can put your stamp on me
Don't you ever, ever do that again.
Do what again?
You really don't know, do you?
He is the big star.
You are the road crew.
- I won't be if that song...
- You will if you don't listen to me.
Now you are a very talented guy.
And you're a cute one too.
There are a lot of talented cute
guys dying to be where he's at.
I got him there.
I can get you there too.
You just gotta listen to me.
Okay?
DUSTY: I know your heart is fragile,
So I'll handle it with care
There ain't no doubt,
I know love's route
I'll bring you cards and flowers,
But I know just what you need
Just give me 24-hours
satisfaction guarantee
Like a pony express in the wild, wild west
I'll ride hard all night long
And I can saddle up fast,
Get you there first class
You know your mail's
gonna get to you
'Cause I'm a top
flight, hold-you-tight
Get-you-there-by-daylight,
Do-you-right overnight male
You know your mail's gonna get to you
Come snow, rain, sleet or hail
'Cause I'm a top flight, hold-you-tight,
Get-you-there-by-daylight
Yeah, I'm a top flight, hold-you-tight,
Get-you-there-by-daylight
Where the sidewalk ends
And the road begins
We said goodbye
On cold dark night
I'm not afraid to go
You bet I'm not
- Did you hear that? Heh.
- Oh! Oh!
Whoo-hoo! They went
crazy over my song.
You're not supposed to be in here.
So, what if I'm in here?
DUSTY : You started learning
What you don't need to know
Where the sidewalk ends
And the road begins
I'll wait for you in
the cold dark night
Where the sidewalk ends,
I'll never know
Hide from the future,
run from the past
I guess I'll stay here
as long as I can last
Whistles still blow
but the train is gone
Ain't no wheels gonna take me
From my home
Where the sidewalk ends
And the road begins
We said goodbye on
a cold dark night
I'm not afraid to go
You bet I'm not
Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot
I'm not afraid to
go you bet I'm not
Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot
Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot
Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot
See you next trip.
What?
Wait a minute. I don't want
him to find you here. Go on.
Out.
So, what if he finds me here?
You were really killing
them tonight, boss.
Yeah, great show. Better than
ever. Incredible sound.
Hear them screaming?
Ha-ha-ha! They went crazy!
WOMAN: Over here, Dusty!
That's exciting.
What was Buddy Jackson
doing in here?
- "See you next trip"?
- Yes. See you next trip.
Since when do you start
changing my show?
Your show? I don't remember seeing you
out there making those people scream.
What is your problem, Dusty?
I'm tired.
I'm tired of the smoke and
the lights. It ain't me.
It's not a cowboy bar with drunks
sitting around a little stage.
This is 20,000 people. They came to see
a show, and they want to see a big one.
Hell, they can't see me for
all the smoke and the lights.
They can't hear me, the
music's so damn loud.
I stopped singing out there for three bars.
Three bars, and nobody even noticed.
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm saying I don't like it.
I don't like the sets.
I don't like the lights.
And I don't like you sneaking
your boyfriend in my bus.
And I don't like you cramming
his songs down my throat.
He is your boyfriend, isn't he?
My personal life is none
of your business anymore.
Well, maybe your business
doesn't belong in my show.
If it wasn't for me...
you would probably still be singing
in some run-down rat hole...
for a bunch of fat
cowgirls from Iowa.
Yeah, and if it wasn't for me, you'd
probably be a waitress there.
- Uh-oh.
- LULA: You listen to me.
Guys like you who can sing are a dime a
dozen. I can find another in a hot minute.
Yeah, well, go find one, then.
LULA: Fine!
Relax. Just relax.
- Sounds like you need a beer, brother.
- You heard? No, thanks.
Oh, yeah.
Man, why does it always
have to be like this?
I mean, everything's
gotten so complicated.
Sometimes I just want
to dump the whole deal.
Including this
stupid-looking outfit.
Oh, hell, Wyatt, it's
better than a real job.
Besides, you're helping
me pay my alimony.
Man...
remember when we was kids,
we snuck out to that carnival?
That one we snuck into because
we didn't have the money.
Yeah, with that fat, old...
bald-headed guy with
the sweaty armpits.
Had that dancing chicken.
Remember when he put
that chicken on stage?
We snuck around back. With one hand,
he was putting the needle on the record.
And with his other, he was turning
on the stove underneath the stage.
That chicken, his feet was burning.
It started hopping all over
the place, just dancing.
Ohh.
The dancing chicken.
DUSTY: Hm.
Yeah, sometimes I feel
like a dancing chicken.
You know what I always wondered?
Why didn't that chicken
just hop off the stage?
- Sure you don't want one?
- No.
What are you gonna do tonight?
Sit right here...
smell the horse manure...
finish down this six-pack, and
go find me a fine-looking woman.
Wife for a night.
How about you?
I think I'm just gonna
take me a little walk.
Take care.
Hey, man, I'll see you around.
Get his bags.
What are you doing?
Just wanted to feel like
I was out in California.
Where's Dusty?
He took a walk.
Where?
- I don't know.
- Knock it off, Earl.
I'm worried.
- Did you see him last night?
- Yeah.
What was he doing?
Was he drunk?
No. I was.
Did he say where he was going?
Yeah.
Earl!
Where did he say he was going?
To take a walk.
WAITRESS:
You boys are making me work.
You know I don't like that.
Oh, yeah. Right.
- Hi, you.
- Hello.
Are you new around here?
Yeah.
Brand-new.
Oh. Welcome.
Well, thanks.
Hello, Grandma.
Did I miss the parade?
What parade?
You know, the one that usually
arrives before you do.
That nice tour manager...
and all those bodyguards
and the reporters.
No. It's just me this time.
I hardly recognized you without
all that hair. Ha, ha.
Oh, yeah?
- Did you quit?
- No.
It's just a short pause.
- So how are you?
- Oh, hell, I'm fine.
I'd like to quit. It's just
getting bigger and bigger.
- Starting to look like a circus.
- I saw you over in Dallas.
- That was quite an extravaganza.
- Why didn't you call me?
I'd have got you tickets and you
could've been backstage with me.
You were working.
You don't disturb men
when they're working.
- Did you like it?
- Of course I did.
It was you singing.
I love to hear you sing.
- But...
- It was loud, and I couldn't hear the words.
Without the words, there's no song.
And?
I could've done without
the smoke and the lights.
- Yeah, me too.
- But the kids liked it.
- You kept my old guitar.
- Yeah.
I learned to play on this old Dove.
Yeah.
I kept it around in case you might
want to play me a song sometime.
No smoke. No lights.
No amplifiers.
No big-stage production.
Just me and my guitar.
- Think anybody would buy that?
- I would.
Bye, Grandma. I'll see you soon.
Howdy.
Want a beer?
Yeah, I'll take a beer.
Is there a rent-car place
anywhere nearby?
Where you trying to get?
Louisiana. Shreveport.
Here.
I used to play in here years ago,
back when I was in high school.
Yeah, I know who you are.
- You do?
- Yes, sir.
I tell you, the place
hasn't changed much.
No. No.
If you played here, you earned
this. It's on the house.
Thank you.
There is a General rent-a-car
place just down the road.
Okay. Appreciate it.
MAN : My friends, Shreveport,
Louisiana welcomes Dusty in concert.
Dave, come in. Anything?
DAVE: Nothing, Lula. We have
all the entrances watched.
I'm too old for this.
Hey, we can't hear it, man.
LULA: Will somebody please
tell me where he is?
Put that thing away.
One of you must know.
- Earl?
- How many times you gonna ask me?
All right. All right, look.
Dusty and I had a
fight the other day.
And I said some things
I shouldn't have.
And I'm sorry.
But I can't apologize to him until
one of you tells me where he is!
- Are you cancelling the show?
- No, I'm not cancelling the show.
There are 25,000 fans out there.
Some of them drove hundreds
of miles to get here.
And they're gonna get their show.
He'll be here.
Thanks, gentlemen.
Y'all been a real big help.
You're supposed to be out on
that stage in five minutes.
I suggest if you wanna keep your
jobs, you better get out there.
AUDIENCE :
Dusty! Dusty! Dusty!
Dave.
DUSTY: Let's do it.
Dusty?
Bring the lights
down really slowly.
More smoke. Now. Right now.
I think we got it.
Okay. Good.
When you hear twin fiddles
And a steel guitar
You're listening to the sound
Of the American heart
Brings a smile to your face
And a tear to your eye
Whoo!
- Harley, honey. How about a little dance?
- Not now, Al.
Oh, come on. Why are you
always avoiding me?
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home.
- Oh, come on.
- Al, leave me alone!
- AL: Hold on. Where you going?
- HARLEY: I'm going home.
- AL: Come on back in.
- HARLEY: I don't want to. I'm going home.
I don't like you. Leave me alone!
- DUSTY: Leave her alone.
- What do you want?
- No, Al! Don't!
- You better back off, cowboy!
- Come on, there's no need to do this!
- I said, back off!
HARLEY: Leave him alone.
Al, come on.
- DUSTY: You're bothering the lady.
- No, don't!
Al, no! Al, that's enough!
God! Why does he
always do this to me?
Al, stop it!
- Hell, he started it.
- Leave him alone. Stop it.
- You should've stayed inside.
- HARLEY: Leave him alone. That's enough!
- Stop it, now. Just stop it!
- Come on back in. Come on back in, now.
Ahh! Ahh!
Harley, my hand! My hand!
- HARLEY: Watch your hands!
- Open the door! Ohh!
Oh, my nose!
- Sorry. I'm sorry about your nose.
- Leave me alone, Harley!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was a mistake.
- Leave me alone.
Why is this happening to me?
I'm not afraid to go
You bet I'm not
Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot
Where the sidewalk ends
And the road begins
We said goodbye on
a cold dark night
I'm not afraid to go
You bet I'm not
Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot
Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot
Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot
Kill spot. Kill it.
Listen to me! Kill spot.
- Bobby.
- Nice show, Lula.
Thanks.
When's Dusty gonna be ready to give
me the rest of that interview?
I've got a plane to catch
in about two hours.
I'm not gonna let Dusty
do the interview tonight.
He's been fighting a sore throat
and I just wanna keep him quiet.
Come on. I just got a couple
of questions. It's no big deal.
BUDDY:
Hey, Lula, it's a good show, huh?
LULA: Can't do it. My first
responsibility is to Dusty.
I gotta go.
- Wait a minute.
- LULA: Sam.
I want you to take Mr.
Louis to the airport.
See he's taken care of.
Catch you in Vegas, okay?
You are really starting
to wear me slick.
We're not playing games. Get in the
bus before somebody sees your face.
What the hell you doing?
- I'm going in this bus.
- No, that's Dusty's bus.
Well, tonight, I'm Dusty.
You don't want my fans to
get suspicious, do you?
DAVE: You don't belong in there.
Lula, you better get over here.
We have a problem.
Peckerhead.
Well, what do you think?
Buddy, we were real lucky. If there
was one glitch with the tape...
- ...if Bobby Louis had come much closer...
- BUDDY: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hell, aren't you
even gonna thank me?
Yes.
Yes, of course, I am.
- Thank you.
- Good. Then we can...
We can go celebrate.
Lula.
The guys in the band would
like to have a word with you.
Get him out of these clothes
before someone sees him.
You bet.
Ah, hell.
You guys were great tonight.
What the hell was Buddy
Jackson doing out there?
Why didn't you just cancel the
show, rain check it or something?
We can't play with a guy
who's lip-synching.
If we speed up or slow down, he can't
follow us or the audience will know.
Where is Dusty, anyway?
Buddy Jackson? Have you
lost your mind, Lula?
If I hadn't done what I did...
all of those people would
have gone home mad.
And we...
would all be out of a job.
Now, I am sure that
your ex-wives...
and Henry's five kids
and Keith's mother...
don't care if it was
Buddy, Dusty...
or King Kong up there on that stage,
so long as you get your paychecks.
You know I have always
taken care of you guys.
Now...
we've got a little time off before
we get to the big show in Vegas.
Everything will be
straightened out.
Dusty will be back.
I'm gonna tell you something. I need you
to promise me you will not say one word...
to anybody about what
happened tonight.
This is for Dusty's sake.
- And your own.
- For Dusty's sake?
I'm sick to death of your crap.
You had him hung up and
twisting in the wind.
He had nothing to do with this.
Tonight was all you, Lula.
He had nothing to do with this?
He walked out.
And he left you and me and everyone
in this room sitting on their thumbs.
- He had everything to do with it.
- You should have cancelled tonight.
I ain't gonna be a damn dancing
chicken in your freak show.
Get yourself another drummer.
LULA: Earl.
Hey, Earl.
Let's do it.
Why the hell not?
- What day is this?
- Friday.
Oh, my. The show.
- You know horses?
- I know a few.
I'm sorry. I was...
a little drunk last night.
Yes, you were.
My name's Wyatt.
Wyatt.
Well, Wyatt...
you can't drink.
And you can't fight.
Can you eat?
Yeah, I think so.
Okay. Might as well
have some breakfast.
Before you go.
Well, come on.
Excuse me.
You can sit over there.
Sure do appreciate
your hospitality.
The hat.
Sure is good.
Harley. You were nearly three seconds
long on that pattern this morning.
I got in late.
Maybe you should just get in a
little bit earlier, you know.
We all need to win this time.
- AL: Hey, Harley.
- HARLEY: What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- I felt bad... Don't be like that.
HARLEY: Why do you have to start this all
the time? Go back in the truck, go home!
AL: Who was that fella last night?
I've never seen him around.
HARLEY: None of your business.
It's not like you know him or
something. What's the deal?
HARLEY: What right do you have to
tell me what I can and can't do! Go!
- AL: You made a mess out of me last night.
- Excuse me.
AL: Why don't you just shoot me
and put me out of my misery.
- HARLEY: I'm sorry about that.
- AL: It's okay, it's not about my nose.
HARLEY: I don't want you coming here and
telling me what I can and can't do.
- AL: I am not telling you what to do.
- You do it all the time! I'm tired of it!
- AL: How long have we known one another?
- Don't you start that.
AL: I'm not starting nothing.
- You all right?
- HARLEY: I'm fine.
Just go back in the
house. Go ahead.
Yeah. Don't you remember that
beating you got last night?
Me? You look like the one
who took the beating.
Not by you. I whupped your ass.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.
What's the matter? Were
you too drunk to notice?
Stop it! Just stop it! Stop it!
Now, we were all drunk last night,
and I'm sure we're all sorry.
Come on, Al, get in
your truck and go home.
Me? Why should I?
This drunk is staying.
- Look, Harley, honey...
- The lady said to leave.
Boy, you're just begging for
another ass-whupping, aren't you?
Absolutely.
What're you doing? What're you doing?
Just go back in the house. Go!
- AL: Oh, my nose!
- Go back in the house.
My nose!
Just go!
Ahh! My hand! Oh, God!
- Come on.
- AL: It's busted up right now.
He busted my nose again.
Get my hat.
Sure is a beautiful ranch.
About how many acres y'all got?
Yeah, I can't blame you
for keeping quiet.
Kind of hard to get a word in
edgewise with those three.
Yes, sir.
People talk too darn
much for my taste.
Yapping about this and that
when they ought to be...
eating, working or sleeping.
What's anybody say that everybody
doesn't already know anyway?
- Can you tell me that?
- No, sir, I can't.
That's too bad. Take,
for example, this morning.
Now, we all know that Harley
was slow on her ride.
We know she was out late last night.
That's no front-page news.
So why talk about it?
I guess I see what you're saying.
You guess? Never guess.
You got to know. I mean you got
to know what you're doing.
If you guess, you're leaving
yourself wide open to suggestion.
And that, to my mind, is what's
wrong with this whole country.
I mean it's going straight to hell.
Everybody's open to suggestion.
Well, you coming or are
you just gonna sit there?
- ERNEST: How long've you known Harley?
- Not very long.
- ERNEST: Thousand.
- DUSTY: Pardon?
- Uh, thousand acres.
- Oh.
Used to be more.
- What happened?
- Well...
Getting to be a business. I'm a rancher.
I don't want to be a businessman.
And taxes are getting
harder to pay.
People want to buy us out.
Seems like we wind up
selling it off, bit by bit.
I'm kind of glad I won't be around
long enough to see it all go.
And Harley?
Well, Harley thinks she's going to
save it by winning at the rodeo.
Would you excuse us
for a minute, please?
You rope pretty good.
I've always wanted to
learn how to do that.
- Good luck.
- Any chance you'd give me some lessons?
Ha, ha, ha. J.W. Did you hear that? This
guy wants us to give him roping lessons.
DUSTY: I'll pay.
In advance.
In advance?
Yep.
Wondering if maybe you might want to
rent out that empty bunkhouse too.
I could pay room and board.
Maybe stay a little while.
Take some roping lessons.
Okay.
You want to buy a rope?
You mind telling me...
- why you can't stand still for one minute?
- All right.
I just don't believe you're telling
our problems to a perfect stranger.
Our problems with this ranch
are none of his business.
If he's such a perfect stranger, what
are you doing bringing him home?
He got knocked out
defending my honor.
Was I supposed to leave him
lying there on the ground?
- If you hadn't liked him, you would have.
- I do not like him.
Then why is he making
you so nervous?
I'll be right back.
What's he doing on a horse?
- Well, he bought it.
- He what?
- He's gonna be staying with us for a while.
- What?
For roping lessons and room
and board. He's paying.
What's your problem?
You like him, don't you?
Why does everybody
keep saying that?
BUDDY: "Lights and smoke swirling,
his voice particularly strong...
Dusty delivered the performance of his
life last night in Shreveport Auditorium."
Idiots.
Idiots? Hell, they love me. They
think I'm better than Dusty.
Loved you?
They didn't even know it was you.
- Thank God they didn't.
- Maybe they should know that it's me.
Buddy...
you've got a lot of talent...
and someday people are gonna be
spending a lot of money to see you.
But these people paid to see Dusty.
So did the people in Vegas who
bought tickets for the show.
And what happens if
you don't find Dusty?
I will.
Uh-huh.
Grandma Ivy?
IVY: Who's there?
- Earl Blackstock.
- Who?
Earl Blackstock. Wyatt's friend.
You took us fishing.
I know who you are.
I just couldn't hear you.
Why don't we go over
here and sit down.
It's cooler over here.
You're looking well, ma'am.
Thank you. I'm feeling pretty good.
The rain is doing great
things for your flowers.
Yeah. They are pretty this year.
He's not here.
Tell you the truth, Grandma Ivy,
I'm pretty worried about him.
He took off and...
He's got all this pressure and people just
trying to get a piece of him, you know.
It ain't surprising.
But this one's different.
He missed a show and...
- That just ain't like him.
- Well, sometimes...
the tree grows too fast.
And the roots don't develop.
And sometimes you have to chop off the top
of that tree to let the roots catch up.
- But do you know where he's at?
- No.
I expect if you follow the
roots, you'll find him.
Grandma Ivy, in all the
years I've known you...
I've never heard you answer
a question directly.
There are no answers.
Only the search.
Yeah. Whatever that means.
It was great seeing you.
Yeah, you too.
- Take care now.
- I will.
Drive careful.
Earl. Don't you leave home,
now, without seeing your mama.
Yes, ma'am.
No. There's no sign of Dusty.
Go, go.
Come on.
Yes!
Yes!
LULA: Come in.
Bobby, no.
I'm not putting you off,
I swear. No, really.
Dusty is working on some new
material for the Vegas show...
and he don't want to be disturbed
right now. Yeah. Okay.
Okay, I'll call you tomorrow.
All right, bye.
- What's the problem now?
- It's Frankenstein.
He's saying we better take care of him
in case Dusty doesn't show up for Vegas.
Yeah. This morning he
asked me for a massage.
Come on, Lula, I don't have to put
up with that. I don't work for him.
I know, I know, I know.
But you guys do work for me...
and I want you to keep
him quiet and happy...
- ...just a few more days.
- Yes, ma'am.
And I don't want him talking
to anyone. Understand?
Yes, ma'am. I'm still not
giving him a massage.
Hi, there.
What do you think?
Looks pretty nice, huh?
Well...
I think it'd look a whole lot better
without that price tag right there.
Oh.
Decided to give Dusty a new look
for Vegas. Drop the cornball stuff.
Buddy, you are not going to Vegas.
Dusty will be back.
Come on, Lula. Dusty is a joke to people
on the cutting edge. He's a farce.
Since when do you know anything
about the cutting edge?
I talked to this reporter last night. She
wanted to know the roadie's view of Dusty.
She said she thought the
whole show was passé.
What are you doing
talking to a reporter?
She bought me a drink.
You know, I got to
thinking afterwards...
here I am saving the day...
yet I'm not getting anything.
No one even knows it's me.
No one's gonna know it either.
- That was our agreement.
- I know.
But everything happened so fast, I didn't
have a chance to think it through.
I mean...
I think I ought to get a
recording contract, at least.
And money.
How much money?
A hundred grand.
Yes?
Oh. Hi, Sam.
No.
No, Dusty's not going to be making
it down to the station this trip.
Yeah.
He's gonna be real
disappointed too.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
No, I'm gonna send you
and the guys some CDs.
Okay, you take good care.
Okay, bye.
A hundred grand?
You are out of your mind.
You know, Lula,
it would have been...
awful easy to tell that pretty
reporter the whole story last night.
Don't you threaten me, Buddy.
That's the thoughts of a fool
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Can I get a cold one?
- Yeah.
- Does Pete Shanks still own this joint?
- Yeah.
LULA : Okay, I'm gonna
come down there myself in the morning.
Just keep on him.
Okay.
So you really can
play that thing, huh?
Two horses?
He really needs a little exercise.
J.W. usually helps me out,
but he's not up for riding.
- And Tim's still out doing chores.
- So I guess I'm nominated.
Well, if you don't mind.
So how come a beautiful girl
like you isn't married?
Well, I almost did once.
What happened?
This good-looking stranger
came into town...
and he said all the right things
and did all the right things.
- And then he went back.
- Back where?
To his wife.
- You didn't know?
- No, I didn't know.
Of course.
- I'm sorry, that was stupid.
- No, it's all right.
I'm over it by now. It just...
It makes you wary, you know?
Hard to trust people.
I trust you, though.
Why?
I don't know. Just
something about you.
You married?
DUSTY: No.
HARLEY: You ever been married?
DUSTY: No.
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.
Hey, brother.
- You look like you're doing all right.
- That's Earl. Earl, this is Harley Tucker.
- Nice to meet you.
- HARLEY: Likewise.
I'll take the horses.
You know, I hardly recognize you.
Clean-shaven, short hair. You look...
pretty.
Younger.
I should've known you'd
find me. How'd you do it?
Something to do with trees and roots.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Grandma Ivy.
- So you've been playing some?
- No.
You're a flat lying
cur-dog, I tell you.
He talks to angels
and the stars start to spin
He thinks of troubles
that he's gotten in
The king of broken hearts
Doesn't know he's a king
I guess you two have
played together before.
What, she doesn't know?
Earl and I played in a
band back in the old days.
Speaking of the old days, you'll
never guess where I went.
I'm gonna
right a great country wrong
That was quite a show you two
put on back at the ranch.
It was fun.
It was more fun than
I've had in a long time.
You're quite a talented
man, Mr. Wyatt.
And you're quite a
woman, Miss Harley.
That I'm gonna right a
great country wrong
Once upon a time
You had time to love me
And once upon a time
I brought you pain
if only we could only
start all over
I'd never leave your
loving arms again
And I'm gonna right a
great country wrong
I've never felt a
feeling quite so strong
I'm gonna hold you till
the heartaches fade
I'm gonna right a
great country wrong
I'm gonna right a
great country wrong
I'll be right back.
Yeah.
Mama used to tell me
Look before you leap
I made a promise that I would
It's one I just can't keep
Try to be careful
And look out for myself
My mind is on my side
But my heart is something else
Looking like it's
gone way over, yeah
After all you put me through
I'm still in love with you
What's the matter with you? Haven't
you ever been in love before?
LULA: Ahem.
You like dancing with my husband?
Looking like it's
gone way over, yeah
After all you put me through
I'm still in love with you
- Come on, Grandpa. we're going home.
- What's the problem?
You son of a bitch!
How could you do it?
How could you stand there...
and look me straight in the
eye and lie to me like that?
I just don't understand it.
I trusted you.
Come on, we're going.
- What the hell is wrong?
- Don't! Don't!
I don't want to see you near
anybody in my family again!
Do you understand me?
No, I don't.
It pulled me down
Tore me apart
After all you put me through
I'm still in love with you
I got a crazy heart
Now still being true
Oh, man.
LULA: Dusty.
It's time to come home.
That's me. Underneath that
Dusty hat, that's me.
Where the sidewalk ends
And the road begins
We said goodbye
On a cold dark night
Harley, this is Wyatt.
Man, I can't believe you two.
Us two?
I swear to God, Wyatt,
I had nothing to do with it.
She must've had me followed
or something after I walked.
Hell, you walked out. Went home.
I followed you just...
Just like I always do.
How was I supposed to know
you didn't want to be found?
I didn't even know myself.
You should've made that
show in Shreveport.
DUSTY: I intended to.
- Things happen.
- Well, man...
nobody missed you.
Lula just cranked up the fire
on another dancing chicken.
DUSTY: Lula.
- Yep?
- DUSTY: I want to see Buddy Jackson.
Haven't found him yet.
Find him. Soon.
You're certainly good at that.
That Shreveport concert, I want you to
reschedule it. I'm gonna do it for free.
If we do that, everyone will
know you weren't there.
We can't let anyone know that.
You don't know what I went
through to save your ass.
Those people paid to see my show,
and that's what they're gonna get.
What choice did you give me,
disappearing like that?
Forget about me. You got a whole
band with families to support.
Did you think about them
on your little holiday?
They're the only reason I'm here.
What are we doing out here?
Where are we going?
Just taking a walk.
You know what happened
while I was gone?
I remembered I could
still play a guitar.
And I can sing.
And I remembered
I used to enjoy it.
And I'm good at it, so
that's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna play the guitar and sing.
No more smoke.
No volcano blast. And
no more light shows.
Just gonna stand on
that stage and sing?
- Can the whole show?
- That's right.
We've been doing this for a long time
together. You can do this with me...
or I'll do it by myself.
That's it.
Whoa! Ugh!
- You all right?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- What was that?
- That was me.
I wasn't concentrating. I just
can't concentrate, damn it.
Just forget about him,
Harley. He's no good.
You got a rodeo in
three days in Vegas.
Get him out of your head.
I wish I'd broken his jaw.
MONIQUE : Today, an entertainment
exclusive. It's Milli Vanilli in reverse.
A member of country superstar Dusty's
road crew reveals an amazing secret.
BUDDY: Yes, I impersonated the
guy through the whole concert.
The TV! Quick! Come here!
BUDDY: The band was live, but the voice
was on tape and I lip-synched to it.
See, his manager offered
me a hundred...
Lula Rogers offered me $100,000 and a
recording contract if I'd keep doing it.
That's him.
BUDDY:
Maybe she found somebody else.
There's no telling how many
different guys she used before me.
- MONIQUE: Where's the real Dusty?
- That, I don't know.
MONIQUE: Dusty ends his phenomenally
successful road tour this weekend...
Country Music Network will be
there to answer the question:
MAN: We'll be back with more from Country
Music Network after these brief messages.
Okay. This is Monique James,
Country Music Network...
and we'll try once again for
an interview in a minute.
DUSTY:
I owe all of y'all an apology.
I put each of you here in this
room in a difficult position...
leaving the way I did,
and for that I'm sorry.
I guess I kind of lost track of...
what our real job was.
Maybe we all did.
In the early days...
it was all about the music.
We did it because we loved it.
Lately, it seems like it's
just for the smoke...
and the glitz and the money.
And it's real easy to get caught
up in that. I know I did.
I think We all did.
That's what happened to Buddy Jackson.
And that's why he did what he did.
We got a lot of fans out there
who don't trust us anymore...
and tonight I'd like to
get that trust back.
I want to thank y'all for coming
in and staying with me...
and I'd like to see the band in
my room later on this afternoon.
Harley, I need to talk to you.
This has just been a
big misunderstanding.
Harley told you she
don't want you around.
Can't you at least
respect her that much?
Look, she's told you once, don't come
around. She don't want you anymore.
Ernest.
You know, it's a funny thing about that
little white speck on top of chicken shit.
That little white speck
is chicken shit too.
MAN : Fans, as the competition's
been keen here in Las Vegas this week...
remember the City of Neons brings
you the best rodeo in the world.
We've got cowboys and cowgirls
from all over the world...
but we've got a beautiful lady from the
state of Texas that'll be next to go:
The time of 16.30 is what we're
running after for the big bucks.
Here comes your pretty lady, Harley Tucker.
One turn to the right, two to the left.
Las Vegas, get ready to have a
Texas lady take the money home!
One more turn to the left and we're gonna
be that horserace fast, happen right here.
We're off and running!
And the number is 16.30.
And the clock, we're
looking at 16.26!
That's what it's all
about, folks. All right.
What did you tell her?
I was just calling you.
Dusty.
- Well, how you doing, Buddy?
- I'm doing great.
- You're not so smart, are you, Buddy?
- How's that?
- This little charade you been pulling.
- BUDDY: I don't know.
I'm getting an awful lot
of media attention.
I can barely keep reporters
from knocking down my door.
I'm a pretty popular man.
Everybody knows who I am.
That's pretty smart.
Yeah, but I think you're
forgetting a little something.
- Like what?
- Like a little matter of fraud.
That fraud you been committing
on 60,000 unsuspecting fans.
Especially when Lula here offers you all
that money and a recording contract.
Come to think of it...
- ...I think that qualifies as extortion too.
- What?
Of course the only person who'd
have to press charges is me.
- Wait. She didn't give me any money.
- DUSTY: What?
- You mean you've been lying to the press?
- Hold on, Dusty.
No, you hold on. I want
you to disappear, Buddy.
If I ever hear of you making
another comment to the press...
if I ever see your face
around country music again...
I'll sue you so fast you
won't believe it. Now go on.
Get your ass out of here.
- Can he do that?
- Yeah.
Go on.
Get your ass out of here.
This isn't over yet.
DUSTY: Yeah, it is.
Thanks.
Harley Tucker.
- Yeah.
- Hi, I've got some tickets for you.
- Tickets?
- Who is it?
I'll pick you up in
the limousine at 7.
- Limousine? You got the wrong room.
- There must be some mistake here.
Are you the Tuckers?
Harley, J.W., Tim and Ernest?
- Yeah.
- No mistake.
Whoa!
MONIQUE: We're live at the
Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas...
where recent allegations by former
staff member, Buddy Jackson...
have left Dusty fans in a turmoil.
We were unable to speak with Dusty,
but his long-time manager, Lula Rogers...
promised he is here and he is ready
to give the best Dusty show ever.
Look at these seats.
Enjoy the show.
- Are you Miss Harley Tucker?
- Yes.
Could you come with me, please?
Someone would like to speak with you.
I'll be back.
- Mrs. Chandler?
- Yes.
- Hope your ride from the airport was all right.
- Just fine, thank you.
Shorter the ride, the longer
the car. Showbiz.
What's going on?
Wyatt, I know this doesn't...
change anything...
but I just wanted to apologize.
Next to Earl, Lula,
you're my oldest friend.
You're due a few mistakes.
You knock 'em dead.
Let's do it.
AUDIENCE :
Dusty! Dusty! Dusty!
MAN :
Ladies and gentlemen...
the Mirage Hotel and Casino
proudly present: Dusty.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I gotta do something a little different
tonight, so if you'll indulge me this...
I'll appreciate it very much.
Could you follow me with the spotlight
right down here in front please?
From here on after
Let's stay the way we are right now
You will always be the miracle
That makes my life complete
And as long as there's a breath in me
I'll make yours just as sweet
As we look into the future
It's as far as we can see
So let's make each tomorrow
Be the best that it can be
Give all I've got to give
To make all your dreams come true
