In Washington,
President Roosevelt takes time out
from war and makes
a solemn promise to 300 delegates
of the International Youth Convention,
representing youth of the Free World,
Victory is essential.
but victory is not enough
for you or for us.
We must be sure
that when you have won victory,
you will not have to tell your children
that you fought in vain,
that you were betrayed.
We, here at home,
are supremely conscious
of our obligations to you
now and in the future.
We will not let you down.
Those famous
dancers from Radio City Music Hall
pay a visit to the Marine Corps Base
at Quantico,
These lovely ladies,
with an esprit de corps all their own,
get a personal tour
around the obstacle course,
The Marines show them the ropes
and the girls show the Marines
a thing or two,
The obstacle course
is no obstacle to them,
as one can see by their smiling faces,
The motto of these
long-stemmed roses seems to be,
"Come on in, fellas,
It's great to be a Marine, "
Combat cameramen captured typical
battle action in Sicily,
These official pictures
show what happened
when an American Infantry squad,
detailed to reconnoiter
a supposedly abandoned village,
find it held by German
rearguard detachments,
Pinned down at first
by machine-gun and mortar nests,
the G,I, 'S press forward,
In this brief but deadly engagement,

After the battle, rest for the weary,
Here are the men who are fighting
for us in Sicily,
Sergeant Joseph R Craig,
Scranton, Pennsylvania,
Private Albert Greenberg, Chicago,
Private Walter Keynoter, Denver,
Private George Baker, New York City,
Corporal Frank Chase, Los Angeles,
Private Theodore Rower,
Phoenix, Arizona,
Private Robert Brogan,
Joplin, Missouri,
and their prisoners,
two not-so-masterful members
of the master race,
Their conquering days are over,
A study in contrasts:
the vanquished and the victors,
All right, fall out.
No, hold it, hold it.
I'm going to give you 10 minutes.
And I don't want anybody getting lost.
I don't want any looting
and I don't want anybody
going in any houses.
They're full of booby traps.
I'm not gonna hang around here
to scrape any stupid idiot off a wall.
Is that clear?
Okay, fall out.
Anybody need any water,
give me your canteens.
I thought I said no looting.
Stupid idiots.
Where are the rest of you?
All right, get outside. Get a move on!
You know you can get shot for this?
Out! Out! Come on, move.
All right, children.
You stupid idiot, leave you in charge.
Everybody out! Come on, move!
All right, let's go.
Tonight the night, baker?
Leave him alone.
You know what, baker?
You're too nice to her.
Cut down on the groceries, just once,
you'll suddenly become attractive.
Talk, talk, talk.
Just shut up, you stupid idiot.
- I'm only trying to help.
- We don't need your help.
- So long.
- George.
You forgot the corned beef
and the chocolate.
It's not normal, you know?
If she don't wanna be like
the rest of them,
that's her business
and it's his business, it ain't yours.
He's been sitting on her
front steps every night for six weeks.
He's beginning to develop
a square behind.
So what?
You're not in charge of behinds
around here.
Or are you?
Funny when you think of it.
This little town, I mean.
First the husbands and boyfriends
go into the army.
Then the Germans move in
and take over the women.
Then we kick the Germans out,
we move in and take over.
Don't you think that's funny?
Sarge?
If she's such a nice girl,
and her husband's been away
for three years,
where did she get that
six-month-old Bambi, huh?
From some drunken Kraut
in a dark alley,
who also gave her a broken arm.
blow, will you?
Go have a nice kaffeeklatch klatch
with that phoney blonde of yours.
She'll tell you all about the Germans.
That's what I said.
Place is like a barnyard.
You ought to know.
You're head rooster.
Really?
Hey, Sarge, tell me, were you really
a burglar before the war?
- What?
- Is it true you did a stretch in Joliet?
Get out of here.
- Take that Russian lover with you.
-  Who, me?
I didn't say a word.
All I said is I'd like to meet
a Russian G.I. sometime.
Is that a crime?
No, that's no crime.
I'd like to meet
some Russian sergeant some day,
find out how they handle
idiots like I got.
You take that.
Go ahead. Here you go.
Let me have the bambino.
Come on. All right, come on now.
Hey, Maria.
Come sta?
- buona sera, Maria.
- buona sera, Giorgio.
- How's the baby?
- Fine.
Oh, I picked this up for the baby.
Oh...
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, Joe.
Not Joe. Ziggy.
Let's get cooking.
Giorgio, you think
my husband is still alive?
Well, I think there's a good chance.
We took a lot of prisoners in Africa.
- but so long, no letter, nothing.
- That doesn't prove anything,
with a war going on.
You might get a letter any time.
You get a letter today, Giorgio?
Yes.
How is wife?
Oh, she's all right. Fine.
- And children?
- You know we just have the boy.
Oh, yes. He plays the baseball.
- Maria, what are you doing?
- You love wife, very much, yes?
- Yes.
- Yes, you love wife, I love husband.
- All right. Please.
- The whole world is full of love.
In peace, not so much love.
Only in war.
You love wife, you love me.
I love husband, I love you.
No, listen. You are a good man.
I know you want to help me,
but you are husband without wife.
I am wife without husband.
but why you think I don't let you
come in my house all this time?
because we are not animal.
Everybody can be animal.
but we are not animal.
You understand?
I cannot be, you cannot be.
So I think better
you don't come back...no more.
I think this very much.
- Honey, please.
- No.
You go away now
and don't come back.
Go find a woman.
You need woman. Please, go.
- You take.
- Oh, for God's sake!
Take! Thank you, but take and go!
- He make baby sick. bad eye!
- Don't be silly. There's no evil eye.
There's no such thing.
- I put baby inside. He hurt baby.
- No, he won't.
They're nice fellas.
He's had too much to drink, that's all.
Having a good time, Johnny?
Hello, Johnny.  Johnny.
Too much wine, huh?
Yes, yes, very dizzy, very dizzy.
Poor little baby, she cry.
I have babies.
Three. I.
- How old are they?
- How old?
Four...and six...and nine.
I had another one.
She died.
Do you miss your kids?
Yes, yes...very much.
The last time I saw my little one,
she like this.
Your lady...let me hold baby?
- Let him hold her.
- No.
He won't hurt her.
You always let me hold her.
He knows her better than I.
He has three. You heard him.
Let him hold her.
Don't be afraid. Come on.
Don't be afraid.
Look! She's smiling!
She smiled at me.
She likes you.
All right, give her back now.
Thank you very much.
Very nice baby.
Very nice baby.
Got to go now.
back to barracks, to sleep.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
Pretty baby.
God bless baby.
You're a good girl.
That was a kind thing you did
when you let him hold the baby.
You are a good man.
You have a good heart.
I put baby sleep.
You wait, please.
Pretty soft for your guys, Craig,
coming and going by truck.
I can remember
when soldiers used to walk.
Yeah? Well, I don't see
your guys walking.
Move it!
Where's your sentries, Craig?
Little bo Peep has lost his sheep.
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
How could you let this happen?
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.
All right, the party's over!
- Hiya, Sarge.
- Upstairs, all of you.
On the double. Come on, move!
Come on.
You can report me for that
if you want to.
Anybody else gets funny,
and I'll do it again.
Now move!
Come here!
- Turn those spigots off!
- Yes, Sergeant.
Come on, come on.
All right, let's go.
With all they've drunk
on empty stomachs,
they'll get sunstroke out there.
You should have
thought of that before.
- Sarge, I've got to apologise.
- I'm not interested.
I wanna tell you I'm sorry.
Will you let me apologise?
I don't want to hear any more!
Understand? Get back to the truck.
- Come on, Sarge.
- Let go of my ear!
- I told you, let go!
- Come on...
Put me down, damn it!
Put me down! You let go... Moose!
Get away from me.
Sarge, I gotta apologise.
So help me, if you put your hands
on me again, I'll kill you.
Now get in the truck.
What's the matter, old buddy?
What's the matter, buddy?
You okay? You sick?
Would you feel any better
if you hit me again, Sarge?
Just get into the truck.
Oh, well, now I've seen everything.
I wouldn't laugh too soon,
if I were you.
Just give me a hand, thanks.
Come on, old buddy. Into the truck.
Oh, Sarge, I'll help you.
Sarge, I'll help you.
I'll help you, Sarge.
I'll help you, Sarge.
Here you are, take this.
I'll help you.
I'll help you, Sarge.
I helped you, Sarge.
Good old Sarge.
There you are, Craig. As fine
a body of men as I've ever seen.
Hey! Where have mine gone?
I told you not to laugh too soon.
Oh, no. In the back, in the back.
I don't even want to look at you.
I understand.
Hey!
Keep moving, keep moving!
Cut across that field
and get under those trees.
What do you want me to do?
Run over the Captain's vegetables?
Why don't you pull up
right in front of his door?
I'm sorry, Sarge.
I worked hard for these stripes, too.
I was up for staff.
That's the way it goes, Sarge.
You do your best and some jerk
comes along and louses you up.
Yeah, but...
Good afternoon, sir.
Sergeant...
Yes, sir?
Looks like you worked those men
pretty hard today.
Yes, sir.
No sense in being a slave driver.
No, sir.
I mean, there's no point
in working them into the ground.
- No, sir.
- Is there?
No. No, no, sir.
They look like a pretty good bunch
to me. Huh?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
And this is a rest area.
I think you can afford to take it easy
with them now and then.
- Yes, sir.
- They'll be going back into action...
- pretty soon.
- Yes, sir.
- And...well, that's all, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Thanks.
but you're getting busted,
just the same.
- You're not safe.
- I know.
I guess I'm just not the type.
Why did you let 'em all get drunk?
I don't know.
I ought to wake 'em up
and get 'em dug in.
Oh, plenty of time, Sarge.
Let 'em sleep. They deserve it. Here.
Here's your share.
You deserve it, too.
No, I'm fine.
I filled up with a nice dry white wine.
That's all yours.
I can't make you out, fella.
I could've sworn
you had leadership qualities.
You'd have made Sergeant
in another six months.
but you got no sense
of responsibility.
You just don't give a damn.
Why? Why?
I don't know.
but don't let it worry you, Joe.
Do I know you?
No, I guess you don't know me.
I'm just a clean-cut
American corporal away from home.
Well, I'm an American, too.
You are? What in the world
are you doing here?
Wait a minute, sonny.
What part of Texas you from?
- brooklyn.
- Now, you must be kidding me, son.
- brooklyn ain't in Texas.
- Why, sure it is. brooklyn, Texas.
Are you sure
you ain't a German spy?
You're too little to be from Texas.
Speak to me, spy.
Hamburger,
tuna fish salad, malted milk,
apple pie à la mode,
with ice cream, sir.
And don't you ever forget
Southern Fried Chicken.
Ain't it wonderful?
I'd like to buy you a drink.
- What would you like?
- bier, bitte.
Two beers, please,
Miss Waitress, ma'am.
Them ltalians is wonderful, ain't they?
Coon hunting tonight.
Any niggers in here?

On the 6th of June, 1944,
the great secret is divulged: D-Day,
Aboard a British warship
with Admiral Ramsay,
General Eisenhower keeps his finger
on the pulse of battle
by personal observation
and is joined by General Montgomery
for consultations
on the progress of our landing,
This is it, They're on the beach,
plunging waist deep into the sea,
These pictures take you among men
who are putting Dunkirk into reverse,
planting themselves
on the first bit of French soil
to be won back after four years,
The G,I, Joes, the Tommies
and Johnny Canucks
press on with "Now let's get at 'em!"
Excuse me.
Parlez-vous anglais?
Yes, I do.
Can I help you?
Yes, ma'am.
We're coming in tomorrow
or the day after.
We might wanna use this house
for a field headquarters.
I'm supposed to check it.
Oh, I see.
Yes, of course.
I'm afraid
it's not in very good condition.
Neither is anything else around here.
Soldiers in the house.
- You'll get paid, sooner or later.
- Yes, I understand.
- You speak good English.
- Thank you.
I'll show you the house.
Adjutant's office.
Must be pretty nice
when you get it all fixed up.
My husband and l,
we used to come here
when Paris got too much for us.
And in the summers, of course.
It's lovely here in the summer.
What are you
doing here now?
No one's supposed to be here now.
This town was evacuated a week ago.
When we heard
there'd be fighting here,
I thought I might have time to get
some paintings and personal things
that were very precious to us.
but I suppose it was stupid of me.
I came just too late
and I couldn't get away in time.
- You were here during the bombing?
- Yes.
- Alone?
- Yes.
- Weren't you scared?
- I was petrified.
I've never been so frightened
in all my life.
Last night was the worst of all.
but you want to see
the rest of the house.
Yes, ma'am.
- You came back to get stuff like this?
- Yes.
Our officers are nice fellas.
I...I mean, they'll be careful.
Some are stupid idiots,
but these ones are okay.
I really don't care.
I shall never return here anyway.
That's the dining room,
but I imagine your first concern
is the sleeping accommodations.
This way, please.
Where were you during the bombing?
In the cellar.
A cellar. That's good.
We'll be able to stick
your furniture down there.
- Were you down there all the time?
- Yes, all the time.
- Did you have any food?
- At first.
but I was too greedy to make it last
and I finished everything yesterday.
That's the cold.
Cold always makes you hungry.
You must've been freezing
down there.
Yes, it was terribly cold.
I had one blanket
and it wasn't enough,
but I was too frightened
to go out for another one.
but...the worst of it...was the rats.
It's odd.
I never dreamed
there were rats in this house.
It's very odd.
My room.
- What?
- My bedroom.
Captain's room.
My husband's room.
I'll get it, I'll get it.
Two lieutenants in here.
You got any other room?
We have a small servant's room
and a bathroom back of the kitchen.
Perhaps I could stay there
until it's safe to leave.
- That's all the rooms you got?
- That's all. We have no guest room.
Philippe and I never wanted
to share the house with anyone
when we came here.
Where is your husband?
Why didn't he come instead of you?
He was shot three months ago.
He...Philippe...
Actually this is the first time I've been
here since they took him away.
I must be hungry.
I haven't eaten since 6 this morning.
You must be starving, too.
I got some stuff in the jeep.
Would you cook it?
Thank you.
I should be most grateful.
- Could we do it now, do you think?
- Sure.
Hmm. I'm sure
you're dying to bathe,
but the water went off the first day.
Lady, it's been so long
since I had a bath,
I'd probably drown in a bathtub.
I've got plenty of water out there
in the jeep to cook with, anyway.
I'm sorry.
I got dizzy for a moment.
You're just about knocked out.
Can you make it?
Oh, yes.
I can make it, thank you.
And the bombs...
the bombs kept falling
and the planes never stopped.
And the big guns roared and roared.
And I was sure the house would
collapse around me and bury me,
and I would never be found,
except as a corpse.
And at first, I thought
I would lose my mind.
And I think I would have,
but I forced myself
to think and remember
every line of poetry
I ever knew and loved.
I'm sure it saved my sanity.
I know now, the body is nothing
and the mind is everything.
I remember, just when it seemed
it would never end,
I kept thinking of that line,
"The universe is nothing
but a flaw in the purity of non-being."
Do you know
the writing of Paul Valéry?
In translation, I mean, of course.
To my mind,
he's our greatest modern poet.
Do you know
"Le Cimetière marin?"
It's always been a favourite of mine.
Forgive me.
I've been chattering like an idiot.
I'm sorry.
You must think me odd.
Well, you've been under a strain.
Excuse me. My stomach's
been ruined by the army.
In the last days of Rome,
the Goths were brought in
to save the Empire
from the German tribes.
Thank you for liberating us.
You're welcome.
- Could I have more wine, please?
- Oh, yes, of course.
Oh, excuse me.
You're tired.
Must you return tonight?
I don't know. I guess not.
Could I stay here somewhere?
I wouldn't bother you.
I mean, you wouldn't
have to be scared or anything.
I wouldn't be frightened.
I don't think
I can ever be frightened again.
I'll see what I can do
about Philippe's room.
Who's there?
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to disturb you,
but I'm frightened.
I just wanted
to stay here...near someone.
Those are our guns, I think.
It's not the guns. It's the planes.
They were bombing till a moment ago.
And you never woke up.
I slept for a while...and I haven't
been able to since.
I...I really don't know
how you can sleep with all that.
I can't be alone.
I just can't bear it any more.
Please, may I stay here?
I won't bother you.
Please.
Dors, Philippe, dors.
Stupid idiot!
Who fired that shot?
Attendez là.
I heard a shot.
- Do you have a problem?
- We almost had them out, sir,
but some stupid idiot fired
and scared them back in.
I think we can help you.
Come with me.
Merde!
Good. Now they're resisting.
I tell you what, Sergeant,
just move your men back
and let them rest for a while.
We'll take over now, if you permit.
There you are, Sergeant.
You can have your men go and check,
but I hardly think it's necessary.
Good hunting, huh?
Au revoir.
Oh, and if you feel
you have to make a report about this,
just pray your country
is never occupied.
So long.
