THE BRIDGE
- Do we get the bombs her too now?
- It won't be that bad.
Besides, the war is over soon.
Let's hope so. My son was
else at the medical examination.
- Sigi?
-Yes.
- But they can't draft him anymore.
- You think so?
Doctor, you'll have your
laundry back in 5 days.
The shirts take quite
a lot.
No need to hurry.
- Thank you, dr.
- Goodbye, mrs. Bernhard.
Fru Borchert,
what was that - a bomb?
Yes, that was a bomb.
The whole house was shaking.
- Do you know where it hit?
-They say it fell in the river.
- Weren't you in the basement?
- With the horse?
- Vent.
- Mange tak, jeg klarer det.
Fabulous, how you
manage alone.
With all the slaveworkers :
aren't you afraid?
Yes, sometimes.
But I have to hide it for the boy.
- Hello, mrs. Borchert!
- Hello, mrs. Bernhard!
- I'll come with laundry later.
- I'll be home then.
Mrs. Borchert, Albert
has told, that...
-... your boy has volunteered?
- Yes.
- Do you allow that?
- Borcherts were all officers...
- Thanks for your help.
- Don't mention it.
- Goodbye.
But it's important to know,
where the bomb hit...
They say, it hit near the bridge...
Look...!
Ah, Mr. Ortsgruppenleiter
is going on a journey?!
Oh, hr. Rendoff, you are
expecting new times!
People, who undermine the party...
... get quickly sentenced.
Remember that, mr. Rendorff.
Emma! Now hurry!
- But I can't leave everything behind.
- Do you have the passport?
- Oh, I forgot.
Just what we needed.
- Mr. Forst!
- Yes?
If you must take trees from my
forest, then ask next time.
The hell I will! It's
for the final victory!
Don't forget that, mrs. major!
- Why do you shout?
- None of your business.
Sit down there.
We also have to drive by the school!
We don't have time for that.
But I have to say
goodbye to my son.
The train leaves in half an hour.
I've explained it to Walter.
Drive!
Walter, Walter! Play me!
The play alone.
Hurry, boys!
What are you doing there?
Did you hear the bomb?
It should have fallen
during lessons!
Yeah, in math class.
The pilot should have our
schedule!
Back to class.
Just ignore him...
What a luck. Only half
a lesson english left...
...and the rest of the
afternoon is off.
- Franziska!
- Yes?
Do you come to the bridge?
The bomb should have fallen there.
Yes, but first we have math.
- Hey...
- Yes?
- Do you know what I have here?
- No.
- Really not?
- No.
Just show it then.
- Look.
- Where did you get that from?
- It was in the basement.
- What do you have there?
A mouse. I'll let it run
during class.
You don't have the guts.
Wait and see.
- There it is.
- Eew...
- Very funny!
- How disgusting!
You're the biggest idiot
at school.
According to the latest news
Oberbach has been evacuated.
Oberbach! But then they're
surrounding us from south.
They've forgotten us...
They should come here,
so we can show them!
Us kids, huh?
"The hope for the future..."
Let him alone.
Shut up!
The americans made
quite a wedge.
The we will get
cut off here.
But we can attack
their flank there.
We'll send in a
division of tanks.
Rubbish! That will just
create a hole in the front.
Maybe I can ask the generals...
...to join this lesson.
-Mutz!
- Sorry. I had to correct the front.
You like to play war, right?
- You want to become officer?
- No, he still wants to be engine-driver.
- Really?
- Well, previously I wanted to.
Good. Soon we'll rather need
engine-drivers than soldiers.
How do you mean,
mr senior-teacher?
Of course first,
when we have peace.
- Are you against peace, Borchert?
- Of course not.
Let's continue the translation.
Hager, you start.
If you... don't
... treasure
If you don't love me...
they shall...
Yes.
Thanks for your efforts, Hager.
And thanks to you, Franziska.
Let's hear, how our
romanticists...
...translated these verses.
Read, Scholten,
you like them.
If you don't want me,
then let them find me.
is better to live without
your love.
The love, that made
me be an explorer.
It gave me advice -
I gave it my eyes.
but sail with me
to the farthest beaches,...
You know, night now
covers my face...
Else the girls blush
colored my face...
and what you wanted
to ask me before.
I'd like to make time
stand still.
I'd like to regret, what
I said... right before...
Tell me, do you love me?
I know, you will say yes.
But if you swear...
- Vorst, close the window!
Maybe Jupiter is
laughing at us now.
Gerhard, close the window.
Continue, Scholten.
Move your luggage away.
Can't you see, I have
a heavy suitcase?
Thank you.
Have a nice trip, bye...
When do we drive?
Why are we still here?
Stop crying.
Be happy, that
you get out of here.
Walter! Walter!
Be well, my boy!
Well done!
What are you doing here?
Why are you not in school?
I couldn't even say
properly goodbye to her!
That's not so important.
The main thing is, that
your mother is safe.
- You only wanted to get rid of her.
- What do you say?
Isn't it true?
That's none of your business!
I want you to be a decent
boy, who...
Hi, mum!
Sigi, there you are!
I worried so much.
Why?
We were in a basement.
The whole english-lesson
came to nothing.
English! What do you need
english for now?
Come. We can eat.
Soon there will be
bombings every day.
You should stay home.
What can I do at home?
- What do we have today?
- Cabbage.
- Cabbage again!
- But I don't have anything else.
I'll go to the bridge to see
what has happened.
Do that afterwards.
First we eat.
Sigi! Come now!
What is it?
Wait! I have to
feed Alberich first.
Hi, how are you?
- Sigi, I wrote to aunt Wally.
- And?
If you maybe could stay
there for some weeks.
What? Should I desert?
What will the others say?
What do you mean: desert?
You're not a soldier yet.
Look! Wotan has again
eaten it all.
At aunt Wally you could eat
every day, too.
And you?
Then I could use your rationing-
coupons to buy for.
I don't have anything left to trade.
And you need new shoe soles!
I'd rather give you Wotan then.
But you won't get me
away from here.
- Hello Karl!
- Thank you, ms Barbara!
We had supper already.
- Oh, it's stuck again.
- Let me.
Oh, how clumsy.
What is this?
Give it to me.
- What does this mean?
- Nothing. It means nothing.
I would say so, too.
I'm sorry.
But there's nothing
to apologize.
- Go. Your father's waiting.
- Yes!
- Hello dad!
- Hello, my boy!
- Are you hungry?
- Yes!
- But I have to go again.
- Where?
I want to see the bomb crater.
Well, first we eat.
If there is a bomb crater,
it will also be there after supper.
Thanks, son.
Give me your plate.
- Do you want more?
- No, thanks.
- Taste good?
- Great.
- What is Barbara doing?
- She's still busy.
- So you wait for the evening?
- Yes.
Here.
I go downstairs
to look for her.
These have to be
washed and ironed?
Yes, but I don't have time
before 6 o'clock.
The just come later.
- Good day, mrs Weber
- Good day, mr Horber.
- Mrs Weber will bring the laundry at 6.
- I can't earlier.
My boss says, at the front they
don't get vacation either...
...for a haircut.
- Ha, what rubbish.
- Yes.
How can he know?
He's reported ill all the time.
- Just come after 6.
- Thanks.
Or do you have plans, ms Barbara?
- No, mr Horber.
- Then I'll come after 6.
- Goodbye
- Goodbye, mrs Weber.
Goodbye.
Ms Barbara, have you seen...
Have you seen the
soap-coupons?
- Here in the box.
- Ah yes.
- Are you done?
- Yes, dad.
- When will you be back?
- I'll be at the boat.
Bye, Karl.
He's quite occupied
by this boat.
I doubt it. He's probably
walking with a nice girl.
I don't think so.
- When I was 16 years old...
- Yeah, you!
Where are those cigarettes from?
Walter Forst. From the personal supplies
of the Ortsgruppenleiter.
- You want one?
- No. Not any of those.
What kind of boy is
Walter Forst?
He's a great buddy.
But else: poor thing.
- Why?
- He doesn't believe in anything anymore.
And what do you believe in?
Certainly in everything,
that dad had told me.
Dad always said:
Sit straight!
Keep the bridles tight
without pulling them.
But back then we
had real horses.
Well, this one shluldn't
suffer from it, right?
That God, you have come, mrs.!
I already thought that...
Trudel, there's no reason
for worrying.
Vladimir, come here!
On my way!
- Has the mail come?
- No, not yet.
I can't understand, why my
draft hasn't arrived yet.
They probably want to wait
until you've grown some more.
This afternoon I will visit
the Jungleiter again.
Children in the war!
Just what we need.
Mum, forbid her to
say these things.
Relax. You know that she
doesn't mean it bad.
- Here's our ration of soap.
- What they call soap.
- In the forest they cut trees again.
- Yes, I know.
They need them for
barricades against tanks.
- Our trees?
- I can't do anything either.
Let's hope they
leave the firs.
But a few firs don't matter.
If dad still was alive,
he's probably not mind...
- You are right.
- Sorry.
- Do you unharness them?
- Yes, of course.
Get going with
your work!
Do something!
There... Easy...
Did I send wood enough
for your boat?
Yes thanks, mum.
There's enough for two boats.
Stop the noise, Walter.
I can't stand it.
I'll be done in a little.
Imagine you can read
with that noise!
It's alright.
- Good news from home?
- They have alarms now all the time.
Mum writes that they hardly
get out of the basements anymore.
And that she's very happy
that I'm here now.
Me too. Who else has two
strong men in the house?
Didn't you want to repair
the windows' blackouts?
- Yeah, I will.
- Then do it also.
- Still no mail from dad?
- No.
- It's been 23 days now.
- Yes.
Mum, it doesn't need to
mean anything.
Suddenly we'll get a
whole bunch of letters again.
You know, during an offensive...
-... they hold back the mail. So no
secrets get disclosed.
You think so?
See? Nothing happened.
Just a little from
the banister.
The bomb must have fallen
in the water.
- It was just the airpressure.
- Yes, nothing else.
Stupid boys. Be happy,
that nothing else happened!
He can talk...
- Where is Sigi?
- Don't know.
- Sigi! Sigi!
- What is it?
How's our tree cabin?
Everything alright?
No special
damages or casualties!
I go home.
- We go too, right, Franziska?
- Yes, for me it's ok.
See you.
- Shall we have a walk?
- If you have time.
- I have time. And you?
- Yes, but only a little.
The come!
Klaus! Klaus!
What was wrong during the
english lesson this morning?
Yesterday you still knew
the text.
Yes, but I can't stand this
sentimental rubbish.
"If you don't love me,
then let them just find me."
When you say it, I find
it funny, too.
I have to go to gym now.
- What's the time?
- 5 minutes to half.
But where's your watch?
When mum got ill, we
traded it for butter.
Here. It's a gift.
- But you can't give me a watch!
- Why not?
You are crazy, Klaus.
The maybe you borrow it?
Why?
So you have something from me.
- But when you need it, you'll tell.
- Of course.
It's luminous.
Very practical at blackouts.
- Come and help me...
- Can we?
- Yes.
Wait a second.
- What is it?
- It's flat.
Mum's biking on flat tyres.
Give me your pump, please.
- The pump was stolen from her, too.
- Hold it, please.
Say, Hans...
- ...during the bombraids...
- Yes, what?
- Were you afraid?
- Yes, very.
- You were a real wimp?
- Yes, of course.
- You simply admit that?
- Why not?
I don't understand that.
- Have you finished?
- Yes.
I'm curious, if Walter
got some rope for the boat.
Look, there's little Sigi.
We have rope and wood!
The boat can float already.
- Was it difficult?
- Why?
Someone giving you
glue these days...
There was noone to give it.
It was there all abandoned.
"Wheels must roll for victory!"
Are you crazy?
How mean of you!
- Your a nice hero!
- It was just for fun!
And you had to try this
with the weakest, right?
- Cut it off!
- Look here!
Here! Someone hid something.
- Pull it up.
- It's a net.
- It's a fyke.
- There are bottles in it!
Oh boy!
Must have been the
easter bunny!
- Easter bunnies don't bring booze!
- How do you know it's booze?
- Real french cognac - 42%.
And egg-liqueur!
So it was the easter bunny.
Wonder who hid this here!
Nobody with good conscience.
We'll sell them.
How many are there?
Let's hide them in the pipe!
Come on! Quickly
- Sigi, you crawl into the pipe!
- Why me?
You're the smallest.
We have to share with the others.
Why should the others
get any?
- Well, we found the bottles.
- No, I found them.
The you'll get two bottles.
"Common well goes before
own well", mr party leader.
- You heard that from your dad!
- Now stop it and let's go!
- And me? Who takes me?
- You can stay here, little one.
Come on, I take you.
Throw to me!
- We got booze for you! You want?
- We don't want any.
Give it to me.
Where were you, Karl?
- Is something wrong?
- No no.
Then let's continue...
- Hello boys, you got rope?
- Yes, mr senior teacher.
- That was probably difficult.
- Yes, very!
Borchert. Tell your mother,...
... that the sawmill sent the
last boards.
And I thank her already...
Where is Borchert?
Horber, fetch the boards.
You should have fetched
the boards, Karl.
Can you give me the
screwdriver?
- They are all whores.
- What do you say?
The bitches are all whores.
- You're out of your mind.
- Your Franziska, too!
Say that again!
In Oberwald a group
of Hitlerjugend...
-... defended that station for 2 days.
- And after the 2 days?
Just asking.
What happened afterwards?
Boys! Boys!
Look - here's my draft!
We have to be at the barracks
tomorrow morning at 7!
Your draft?
I talked with the Jugendleiter.
Whe do you have to be there?
Tomorrow at 7.
Of course! Without us
they cannot win the war!
Private Walter greets private Schorten.
How awesome!
Private Walter, turn right!
It's probably because my
father is fighting at the front...
Mr teacher, don't build on the
boat with another class...
It's our boat.
We'll finish it, when
we're back from the front.
The we'll build it
as a warship.
- Mr teacher.
- Yes yes.
I'll tidy here.
- Let's go home now...
- Yes, goodbye.
I wished it was
tomorrow already!
- Hurry, Mutz.
- And tell your mother.
- I will write her a letter.
It would be easier to
telephone!
Come on, it's late.
- Hurry.
- Have you put the tools back?
- Yes, ms.
- Goodbye.
What are you doing there?
Come up!
And make it fast.
Give me that bottle.
- Liqueur, right?
- I don't know.
- Do you have more of that?
- Not me.
And the others?
Where did you steal them?
Steal? We found them.
Come with me. Not reporting a find:
punishment of 3 years.
But I have to go
to the army tomorrow.
You have to what?
Yes, the draft is at home.
Really! Do I still have
to come to the policestation?
Nope! We go home to mum,
so she can dry you first.
Sigi!
What has happened?
I fell in the water.
Has my draft arrived?
- Yes.
- Where is it?
He... he can't become
a soldier already!
- He's just a child.
- I'm not a child!
And how do you look!
You're all wet!
- That's not important!
- Out of your wet clothes!
Else you'll be in bed
tomorrow with pneunomia.
No way!
I have to be at the barracks tomorrow.
Hr. Vorschläger!
This must be a mistake!
You must know.
No. They draft everybody now.
Then I'll send you away.
Sit down.
I'll send you to aunt Wally. Yes.
There you can hide.
I'm not a deserter!
Hr. Vorschläger,
what shall I do?
I donb't think, you can do anything.
And about this liqueur... I'll
close my eyes this time.
Where is the liqueur from?
You can trade it!
And Wotan, too.
Thank you.
The boys had a secret stock of liqueur -
and that's illegal, of course.
Illegal? But then put Sigi
in jail, until it's all over!
Or...
this is insane!
I can't say anything about this.
I'm on duty.
You have to understand.
Mum?
Yes, Sigi?
Do you still have the little suitcase?
Can I borrow it?
You want to go to aunt
Wally anyway?
I don't want to have a
cardboard box for the barracks...
-... that looks stupid.
- Yes... I understand.
- Hello lad. There you are.
- Yes. Why?
There's something for you.
Your draft.
Karl, it can't become so bad.
First they have to train
you some months,...
- ...and then...
- So now you get rid of me!
- What do you mean?
- I've seen you two!
Get out! What do you want?
I don't want to see you here.
Karl!
Go! I don't want to see you!
Out!
Are you insane?
Barbara,
let us alone for a minute.
What's up, Karl?
You're happy that I leave!
Then it's just you two here!
Karl ... I don't know...
why you are like this.
When two adult persons
like Barbara and me...
You like Barbara, too...
Would it be so bad, if
she stayed with us?
Stop packing!
That can wait until
tomorrow morning.
When you get sensible again,
you can come down to us.
Then we can talk.
No idea what happened
with the boy.
Don't be angry.
He's still a child.
You're right. I thought,
he would be a man already.
They don't belong in barracks,
but in a kindergarten!
- Relax!
- They should be in the kindergarten!
You also have to send the tractor
to the garage, mum.
Don't worry, Jürgen, I'll take care
of everything.
- Madam! The slaveworkers have
all disappeared! - What?!
What shall we do now?
We should inform the police...
- ...or the party's...
- No!
I don't want these people
in my house today!
But the laws are so strict!
When two of them disappared at
Letmanns, and they didn't report it...
Yes, I know.
I'll take care of it tomorrow.
- Trudel, would you leave us, please?
- Yes.
How will you manage
without workers?
Maybe they will send others.
But ours just got used to it.
Who knows, who they send now?
Yes? What can I do about it?
- It's all become so strange.
- You can say that.
And exactly now I have to leave!
Jürgen, you know me.
I can defend myself!
But that's father's pistol!
Yes. They sent it after his death.
- Mum. Can I have it?
- Take it.
Thanks, mother.
You have no idea,
how glad I am.
Dad taught me to shoot
with it.
As officer-applicant
I am allowed to carry a weapon.
When do you have to
get up tomorrow?
- We'll have breakfast together!
- Of course.
I will have us woken
at half past 5.
- Good night, mum.
- Good night, my boy.
You're fantastic!
You're always classy.
Don't pack too much. It has to fit
in a rucksack.
- Here, your cardigan.
- Put it there.
- What do you want with the knife?
- I'll take it with me.
We're not playing
cowboys and indians.
But the Jungführer said, that one
doesn't shoot at night.
- At night you work with a knife.
- Rubbish.
He read too many novels.
Hans, you have to write home also.
- Here are more socks.
- But we'll get them at the army.
You have to have some
to change.
"During the battle the
warriors changed socks!"
How mum imagines the war!
I don't want to imagine it at all.
Look! You wear them out so much,
that they can't be mended anymore.
I think, those are mine.
I'll do it.
- Do you do it at home too?
- No.
Mum, I also need soap.
There's a piece in the
kitchen drawer.
- You can share that.
- Thank you.
Fabulous: soap!
If I had known that,
I would have taken it long ago.
- Mrs Mutz...
- Yes?
I...
I want to thank you
for letting me stay here.
But Hans... Then I have to thank you
for being here.
Why?
It was so good, that you were here.
For Albert and...
You're already so adult.
Ha, if my mother could hear that!
Look in the kitchen closet.
I beg you, Hans, take care of him!
Yes... now you said "du"
for the first time.
I promise.
I'll take care of him.
And take care of
yourself, too.
Tomorrow you'll have lessons
without me.
That's not funny at all.
Hello? Post office 2?
No, the mail wagon comes with
the passenger train 12:17. Right.
Yes, that's changed.
Klaus, we have problems
again with 12:17.
What will your parents say,
that you're out so late?
They'll get angry.
Shouldn't you rather
go home then?
- Today I don't care.
- Really?
- Will it take long?
- If there's an airraid on Berlin...
... we won't get any connection.
- Couldn't you try again?
- Ok, I'll try.
Can I have 3-14?
Otto? How is the air situation?
Ah, thanks.
Right now there's only a raid
on Hannover-Braunschweig.
Maybe we're lucky.
What's the time now?
See! One can see it clearly
with the luminous numbers.
- Franziska?
- Yes?
- I want to ask you something.
- What?
But don't get angry.
Are you sure?
You can ask me everything, Klaus.
It's our last evening together.
Can I have the watch back?
When I'm on patrol at night,
such a luminous watch is practical.
Here post office 2 - is that Bremen?
- Can I talk now?
- Yes.
Hello, mum. Are you there?
What? How?
No, I'm fine.
Listen, I'll be drafted
tomorrow!
What do you want?
Did you get lost?
- Here's my draft.
- Draft?
But not at this hour.
Can't you wait until
tomorrow morning?
He's afraid, he'll miss
the free beer.
Alarm! Alarm!
- Silent!
The bombraid over
Hannover-Braunschweig...
Louder!
Sounds nice.
We can't use you here, boy.
Here you come precisely.
I can't go home.
Let him stay, Paul.
Alright. Lie down there.
- Here's a blanket.
- Thank you.
Your father tells you to
turn off the negro music.
It bothers him.
- It bothers him? Why?
- I don't know.
Tell him to turn off
that music!
And bring my dark suit.
There's still room here.
Where is...?
Are you going on
vacation?
Walter, I have to leave.
I got...
... a call from the headquarter.
Where are the cigarettes?
Everything in this house
is a mess!
We have an important meeting...
And for that you need
the dark suit?
Don't interfere.
- None of your business.
- Here it is.
Give it to me.
Tomorrow I'll become
a soldier, dad.
Yes, I know.
But the party leader
goes on the run!
"For Führer, people
fatherland!"
Do you also take ms
Möhlmann with you?
- What?
- Her from the economy office.
- Shut up!
- The whole town knows it!
That you sent mum away...
...so you can have fun
with this whore!
- Have you been drinking?
- Yes, from your bottles.
Those reserved for the
front soldiers.
Shame on you!
When we meet again
after the war...
Trust me. We won't
meet again!
Just see tomorrow:
They'll teach you how to behave!
They'll teach you to march!
It's time that
you learn discipline!
Brat! But they'll make
a man out of you!
A man like you?
Have you slept with my
father, too?
Say something! Speak!
Your father shows
much more tenderness!
First group!
Attention - get up!
Turn right! Forward!
Do you think, we can make
soldiers out of these boys?
No. Cover!
Crawl into the soil!
Head down!
Do you want it shot off?
What will you think with then?
Whole group! Back!
Cover!
You don't need to train "Back" -
they can do that already.
What's the idea of this?
Ask them up high!
Whole group turn right!
Forward!
Cover!
I'm beaten.
Whole group forward!
Cover!
Turn right and forward!
Excuse me, but I have to
finish these papers.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
Make sure, we won't
be disturbed.
What can I do for you?
The boys from my class...
... are in your division.
- Yes, I know.
Mr Fröhlich... I come to
you as a colleague...
You are teacher, too.
I've been soldier now for 5 years.
- Yo are not in the service?
- No, because of my heart.
What do you teach?
English, history, german...
I assume, you've come to
talk about your students.
Yes. I want to ask you a favor.
I can't understand, why
these children...
...have to be sacrificed so
meaningless.
I talked with the boys, mr Stern...
They are idealists.
They believe, that they fight...
... for an ideal.
They want to save the fatherland.
They believe in what
you have been teaching, mr Stern.
Hölderlin! "The battle is ours!"
My life for the fatherland!
"We don't count the deads!
No sacrifice is too small!"
Bt mr Fröhlich,
all these ideals...
...heroism, fatherland, freedom...
...have fallen in the hands
of criminals!
They aren't valid anymore!
Some days ago my son died
at the front.
What is not valid anymore?
Forgive me.
I don't think, that I still
can be a teacher after this war.
Mr Fröhlich...
The purpose of my visit was,...
...to ask you to do something
for my boys.
How do you mean?
Maybe you as leader of the division
can keep my boys out of this...
Don't talk rubbish!
I'm not even allowed
to listen to this.
I have my orders and
have to follow them.
Captain...
-Is it clean now?
- No, it's still dirty.
I can't see anything.
Hi, little one - exhausted?
I feel so bad.
I'm at the end.
Give me your rifle.
We'll do it for you.
Now we should have had biology.
Then I would feel bad, too.
Does the bayonet need to
be cleaned, too?
After all we have to clean
our weapons...
... or do you think it's a toothstick?
Why isn't it sharp?
- So the hole gets bigger.
- Why?
Obvious: if it was
sharp as a knife...
...it would easily get in and out.
You're finished, when you
get this in your belly.
In the belly?
Where else?
Afterwards you have to put your
foot against, to get it out.
How do you know?
I read about it.
That's something different
than flirting with girls, huh?
Shut up!
Attention!
Group three about to
clean weapons.
Notice, Forst: when
cleaning weapons...
...there is no "Attention",
understood?
- Yes sir.
- Go on.
You're quite good at
this already.
Learned at the premilitary
education, mr sergeant.
Talk only when asked.
Yes, sergeant.
- You want to become officer, right?
- Yes.
Your rifle.
Keep it still.
Higher.
You haven't learned everything
at this premilitary thing.
- Once more.
- Yes, sergeant.
Go ahead...!
You think, there is
enough oil around, huh?
Oh, oh, oh! You're wasting
public property.
What are you doing there?
Private Siegfried cleaning
weapons, sir.
I can see, you don't steal apples
What sort of knife is this?
It's pushed in the belly, and you
have to stem the foot against.
Shake before use,
it said on the bottle...
...filled with poison.
Continue!
Alarm!
Prepare to leave!
Alarm!
Prepare to leave!
Alarm!
Prepare to leave!
Alarm!
Prepare to leave!
Alarm!
Prepare to leave!
Alarm!
Prepare to leave!
Alarm!
Platoon, get up!
Hurry! Up! Move!
Alarm!
Prepare to leave!
Alarm!
Prepare to leave!
Alarm!
Prepare to leave!
They don't even let us sleep.
I can't close the buckle.
Attention!
- How's it going?
- All ready, sergeant.
Get out! Hurry!
Get that buckle straight.
- Do you have everything?
- Yes, sergeant.
- Don't forget your bucket!
- What does the sergeant mean?
Here! Your helmet!
What are you waiting for?
Out! Move!
Hurry people, move!
One of them actually
forgot his bride!
Move! Move!
The situation is crap.
Zimmerman! A cigar!
We make a wedge here,
which must stand until tomorrow.
It must hold.
Fire anyone?
Thanks.
This afternoon the americans
reached this line.
Bees, come in.
Bees, come in!
My orders are...
...to throw everything to the front,
that can carry a rifle.
Only the wounded stay here.
Zimmermann, read.
Captain Fröhlich leads the
battallion on the march.
The bataillon follows
march-order...
...1, 2, 4, 3, with the ambulances
and supplies at the rear.
The defensepositions must be
reached at sunset.
All units at...
... 4 o'clock in the morning.
Check the watches.
Battallion! Attention!
Battallion ready, lieutenant!
Eyes right!
Grenadierbattallion 463
reports ready.
Thanks. At ease.
At ease!
Soldiers!
Yesterday the americans
started a new offensive.
Our battalion is from now on
part of division 336.
We proceed tonight.
I expect from the experienced
soldier of the battalion...
...that they
- as always- ...
...do their duty.
We will engage the
enemy tomorrow morning.
Every squaremeter,
which we defend,...
... is part of the heart
of our fatherland.
And who defends just
one squaremeter...
...he defends Germany.
We know, that the
situation is bloody serious.
But we are soldiers -
whether we live or die.
History will judge,...
... if we did our duty.
The young soldiers on their
first mission shall know...
...that our battallion only
knows "Forward"!
Never "Back"!
Our battallion only knows
fight, victory or death!
I expect, that the fatherland
in these serious times...
...can count on you.
The parole also for
this mission is: ...
Forward for Führer,
people and fatherland!
- Let the battallion be dismissed.
- Yes, captain.
- Zimmermann! A cigar.
- Yes, sir.
Get ammunition
and supplies.
The new report.
Zimmermann, make sure
there's enough brandy.
This will become a slaughterhouse.
Where's my car?
Get it!
Yes, captain.
What is it?
Captain, I have 7 new
privates in my platoon.
And?
They are 16 - untrained.
- Soldiers since when?
- Since this morning.
At the first shooting they will run
- and the platoon with them.
Just what we need.
Zimmermann!
Where are you?
We have to go!
There's this little bridge
at the entry of the town.
It's not important anymore.
The americans already have
a bridgehead in the north.
And the bridge will be
blown up anyway.
But we should secure the bridge.
The boys could do that.
It's ok with me.
Just put them there.
Yes, captain.
Drive!
- Heilmann! The lieutenant calls you.
- I'm coming.
Sorz!
- You are in charge.
- Yes, sir.
- Sergeant Heilmann!
- Yes! I'm coming!
Now they make us be cannonfodder
five minutes to twelve.
They don't care.
Let me get through.
No contact with the enemy!
No shootings.
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.
How long have you been soldier?
And what did you learn
during those 7 years?
Not to be noticed.
That's exactly what I
expect, Heilmann.
The bridge isn't important.
It will be blown up.
- No meaningless casualties!
- Yes.
Thank you.
Here we have order!
- Wait! You're only allowed one can!
- What?
- Put one can back!
- I beg your pardon?
Here they count everything -
all into the massgraves
Then keep your damned cans!
What on...
Pick them up immidiately!
You only have a big mouth,
because you're in uniform!
Shut up or you'll
regret it.
Trust me in this:
I'll survive until the end,...
...just to pay you back!
- I will report you.
If you live long enough!
Coward!
- Verbitsky!
- What?
- Don't delay anything.
- Yes.
- Don't be stupid! Move.
- Yes, sir.
I couldn't know, that this
is a kindergarten.
Hurry and get your weapons...
...and go outside.
Get going.
Get up.
Close the hatch.
Heilmann, here.
Sergent Heilmann!
Get your people off.
- Group 3, off the truck!
- We don't go further?
The rest of the group
goes on.
Are we already at the front?
Rubbish.
But...
but this is our bridge!
What are we doing here?
Be glad, you idiots!
Would you rather be there,
where shit really is boiling?
What a theater!
Those from "Volkssturm" seem
to have gone home already.
Even better. Like this they
can't wreck anything.
Keep them busy.
In the meantime make sure,...
... that the demolition command
arrives in time.
The bridge needs to explode
in the right moment.
Understood.
- I trust you, Heilmann.
- Yes, sir.
- Stupid carrying!
- It's not fun anymore.
Stop complaining and bring
the gear over here.
Do you think,
we're safe here tonight?
Tonight something will
happen everywhere.
Soon the dragging is over.
Then we'll have a nice time, ok?
They put us off far away
from the front.
The backseats are the best -
like in the cinema.
In the frontseats it's flickering.
Let's put the gear here.
Put the tank fists
over there.
Position of the first
machinegun?
At the right side of the road.
And the second?
Here at the left.
We know the bridge. We know
good shooting positions.
You played indians here, right?
Yes. Up there is our
recognition post.
Can't I take position there?
Ok, climb up and keep
an eye on everything.
Yes, sergeant.
Assemble the machinegun,
I said. Get going.
I go forth with this,
sergeant.
No, stay here.
And don't play around with it.
Better go over there
and help them dig.
And what can I do?
You go on the bridge and
keep guard, understood?
- Yes, sir.
- And don't abandon your post.
Keeping guard is the most
important thing in war.
- Yes, sir.
- Now go.
And what are you doing?
I need ammunition on the tree.
What a luck, that we don't
have a cannon also.
You would drag it up, too,
right?
- Isn't it deep enough now?
- Don't be silly.
When they come, they can
still shoot in here.
In this fog they can't
see us anyway.
And when the fog disappears?
Third group, attention!
Listen...
When it gets light, you'd
probably like some coffee, right?
- Yes, sergeant.
- I'll go and organize some.
In the meantime the
command is at...
-... Scholten!
- Understood.
- Yes, sergeant.
- Take my rifle.
- Yes, sir.
And carry on.
What a guy!
Why? He's nice.
Rubbish. A good soldier doesn't
leave his rifle behind.
- Excuse me, do you have fire?
- Yes.
- Cigarette?
- Yes, thanks.
Hide.
- Stop! What did he want?
- Why?
- What did he say?
- Err...
Move on! Quickly!
Stop!
What are you doing here?
- Me?
- Yes, you. Where are your orders?
- I don't have them with me.
- What unit do you belong to?
Sergeant Heilmann. 463. battalion,
- And what are you doing here?
- I...
Your reportbook!
Here. I'm securing the bridge.
Rubbish! That bridge doesn't
need to be secured.
It will be blown up.
- No stories! You're a deserter!
- What do you mean? Deserter?
Follow to the office!
There you'll see, what will happen.
But I have my group at the bridge.
I can't leave them.
Don't talk! Follow me!
They are still kids! They've been
soldiers for only one day.
My orders are to take
care of them.
Then why do you walk around
here at night?
But I'm on duty!
Everyone can say that.
You idiot!
Don't be so stubborn!
Come to the bridge and
have a look yourself!
To send kids in the war and
then abandoning them! It's insane!
It's...
Take that stupid thing away!
Stop! Stay here!
What was that?
It was shots...
Can you see something up there?
No. Nothing.
Just come down then.
With this weather
war should be prohibited.
When will Heilmann be back?
He'll come.
- I'll have a look.
- You stay here.
Yes, sergeant.
If only Heilmann doesn't
leave us in the lurch.
Not him!
A lot better persons than him
have deserted.
You have too much imagination.
Did you hear that?
Just some fish...
Now we have 10 rolls already.
We'll never need so many.
Listen!
Artillery. But far away.
- Everything ok over there?
- Yes.
Then come.
Walter, can I borrow your torch?
Are you afraid in the dark?
Can't we eat soon?
- Yes!
- Then let's eat.
Cut some slices.
And Heilmann had promised
coffee.
He left us in the lurch.
- Rubbish.
- Can't we talk about something else?
Sigi, why didn't you send
the sergeant to your mother?
She makes the best coffee.
I can'tt ell the sergeant
what to do.
Don't you have your own?
Don't make such a scene.
If my mum knew,
that we are here...
This sausage is fabulous.
Here, for Sigi.
- Here, Sigi.
- Can I eat when on guard?
You have to. You're
still growing.
Aren't you hungry, Karl?
No, thanks.
Not such a bad place.
We're just missing
something decent to drink.
We should have some brandy.
There the sergeant comes.
No way. He left over there
and comes back here?
What are you doing here?
Having breakfast.
Want some liver pate?
Do you plan to start
a shooting here?
We have our orders.
This bridge is
strategically important.
- Boys, you better go home.
- What?
Are you insane?
But what you do here,
is foolish.
The whole town will be destroyed.
I know it.
I've been through it,
before I got evacuated.
Go home.
You want to persuade
us to desert!
Bad nerves, huh?
We're at war, understand?
And we have to secure the bridge.
You have no idea,
what you are doing!
You just want to play heroes.
Move! Go away!
Don't do anything unreasonable.
Away! Now!
You don't know,
what you're doing.
Look, fast as a rabbit.
How fast he can run!
What a coward!
He runs like a girl.
Maybe he's right. We don't
know, what he's been through.
Me too!
Stop fooling around.
Stop acting like
you're in charge.
Who hits them first?
- Listen!
- What is it?
- A truck!
- Quicklt! Pull the barricades out!
What's going on?
What are you doing?
Hurry! Take positions!
Damn it!
What's going on here?
What idiots are blocking the bridge?
Are you insane!
Open the road!
Get moving!
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir.
Get down and help them.
Move.
It's unbelievable.
- What happened?
- Don't ask stupid questions.
Move that away.
Let's drive now.
Quickly.
We pull the barricades
back on the road again.
No, not yet. There will
come more trucks, he said.
I think, we should wait.
I go back to my post.
What happened, Helmer?
It's finished, lieutenant.
It's dead.
We have to walk.
Damn. Get your stuff.
We're changing vehicles.
Quickly.
We have to get out of here.
Look! He has a...
Watch out!
Bloody pigs.
Get your rifles out!
The next who doesn't stop...
...will get a bullet in his head.
Come on, what are you waiting for?
Leave it behind. Or throw
it in the water.
- But...
- Leave it behind!
Hurry now!
We have to get out of here.
There's no more room.
Drive!
Do you all want to die here?
- When do we drive?
- I don't know either.
Why do we stop in the
middle of a bridge?
- We want to go home.
- Hurry a little!
Don't be impatient.
I do what I can.
It's getting light already.
We have to go.
Wilhelm, look at those kids.
Here, little fellow,...
Have some chocolate,
before you get pickled.
Come on, drive.
What did he mean
"getting pickled"?
He wanted else to give
you some pickles.
Be happy, that you
got some chocolate.
What a coward -
the one with the Iron Cross.
He was deserting?
He was very busy, for sure.
He simply ran away!
They should all be shot.
Now there's noone left
between us and them!
- You want to go home maybe?
- Of course not.
- If everyone is running, it's maybe the best.
- What?
- Best to go home.
- Are you insane?
What do you mean?
We are soldiers, and it's
our order...
...to secure the bridge!
We won't win the war,...
... because we defend
this bridge, Jürgen!
But with every
squaremeter of land,...
... we defend Germany!
Who wants to throw the
weapons and go home?
- You?
- Why me?
- And you two?
- No.
I stay.
- And you?
- You think, I leave you alone?
- And you?
- I'm not a coward.
And you? Are you a coward?
I stay.
Great! Well, everyone
on their posts.
I go over there with my
tank fist.
Watch out! Airplanes! Down!
Down!
It's still some kilometers away.
They're first dangerous, when
they come right towards you.
See him!
Flat like a stamp!
You want to lie there,
until the war is over?
Have you peed in your pants?
Our brave Sigi!
What will mummy say,
if she sees you like this?
Watch out, ity's coming back!
Down!
Come on, get up!
It's safe now, Sigi!
Sigi! Sigi...
Sigi...
Come here!
Damn it!
Come here!
Those swine killed him!
Sigi is dead!
Come here!
Come here, bloody hell!
What happened?
Those criminals...
What do we do now?
We have to tell his mother...
Poor Sigi.
I'll show them!
Hey, help me.
What sound is that?
It's tanks!
Hurry!
The barricades on the road!
Bloody tanks!
Back!
We let the tanks pass
and blow it up later!
Into the basement there!
Walter has hit a tank!
Shoot now!
Get the boxes
with ammunition!
Damn! Something's stuck!
Help me.
Walter is crazy!
Cover him!
Are you crazy?
Cover!
Those bloody kids will
have us all killed!
What a bunch of idiots.
If they had let the
americans pass,...
...we would have had blown up
the bridge already!
Oh God, how shall this end?
This is nothing.
The real fireworks is at the front.
My son is soldier, too.
They drafted him yesterday!
You think, he's at
the front already?
Yesterday?
The he can't even hold
a rifle yet.
What should he do at the front?
Now show, how brave you are.
You're not going to
break down now, are you?
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
Are you only tough
in front of girls?
I want to go! I want to go!
I want out of here!
- Jürgen! Jürgen!
- Stay here!
- Jürgen!
- Stay here!
What are you doing?
Are you insane?
There are americans up there.
And there are women and
children in the basement.
If you don't leave, I'll scream.
Go away.
Don't be stupid!
Don't shoot!
"Bloody kid!
What did you do that for?"
- There's another one! Watch out!
- Shoot him!
"Hey, hey! You!
Let's not shoot!"
- "Come on, give up."
- What's he shouting?
"We don't fight kids!"
"Go home! Go to your
kindergarten."
"Go! Go home!
To the kindergarten."
Kindergarten? I'll show you!
Karl!
Karl! Karl, shoot!
Kill him, Karl! Shoot!
Shoot! Finish him, Karl!
Finish him.
Karl! Karl!
Karl, Karl shoot! Karl shoot!
Karl, Karl ...Karl...
Karl...
Karl...
Karl...
Karl ...I didn't mean to hit you!
It was only because
of Franziska, Karl.
Hit me now, Karl!
Karl, hit me!
Hit back, Karl! Help!
Help! Help!
I have to go to him!
They're killing him!
Help...
Help... help...
Get down!
I killed him, Hans.
I killed him!
I killed him...
Come, Karl...
Karl ...Karl ...Karl ...Karl...
Come with me, Karl...
Karl ...
Come... Karl...
Karl ...Karl...
Klaus, cover!
I killed him, Hans!
I killed him.
I killed him!
Stop it!
Leave me alone!
Let me be!
Calm down, Klaus!
Karl! Karl!
They are gone.
- Albert!
- It's not so bad.
Take the jacket off.
I put a bandage on it.
I'll help you.
- They'll fetch reinforcement.
- You think?
We have to get away.
Walter!
Walter!
Come.
The dynamite and fuses.
Put the boxes there.
Use a lot.
It's a massive bridge.
Yes, sergeant.
- What are you doing here?
- We blow up all this mess.
What a circus you've made here!
How many have died?
And now you expect a
medal around your neck, huh?
Well, go home to mum
and get celebrated!
This is not true!
This is not true!
- This is not true!
- You're some nice heroes!
Be quiet! Shut up!
Shut up!
It's not true!
- Get lost! Go away!
- Take it easy, my boy.
Take your rifle away. Don't be stupid.
We have our orders.
Move!
Get off the bridge - now!
I had to do it...
I had to do it!
Pigs!
Criminals!
Away! Get lost!
Get lost! Away with you!
Hans! Hans! What's up?
Answer, Hans! Hans!
Come. I'll take you home.
Hans, come on. I beg you.
Hans...
Hans, come...
Come with me, Hans...
Hans ... Come... Hans...
Hans, Hans!
Kom, Hans... come...
Hans, come...
This happened on april 27th, 1945.
It was so insignificant,
That it was not mentioned...
...in any military report.
THE BRIDGE
