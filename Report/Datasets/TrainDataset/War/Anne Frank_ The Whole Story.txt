ANNE FRANK: I want to be
a champion skater and a writer.
I want my picture
in all the magazines.
Maybe I'll be a movie star.
I want to be different
from all the othergirls.
I want to be a modern woman.
I want to travel.
I want to study languages--
languages and history.
I want to do everything.
I want to...
LEO: Anne! Anne!
Oh, that bratty Leo Koopmann.
He thinks he's in love with me.
He's always looking at you.
SAE: Anne, do you
want to ome over...
and play Monopoly tomorrow?
Sanne, you know my grandmother
is oming to visit.
Why don't you ask Hannah?
I'll be at shul.
So religious.
LEO: Anne! Anne!
Quikly.
Oops. Sorry.
-Well, I'm off.
-Bye.
ANNE: Bye.
o, no. I'm not saying
you're a bad ook.
Of ourse.
I'm sure your husband...
loves the way
your strawberry jam is.
Mm-hmm.
-Hello, Mr. Kleiman.
-Hello, Anne.
ANNE: Miep, where's father?
One minute.
He's in the storeroom...
with Mr. Kugler
and Mr. Van Pels.
Thank you, Miep.
May I say how nie
you look today?
The problem is
you're using too muh sugar.
VAN PELS: Too much nutmeg.
Not enough coriander.
I, uh...
black pepper
with, uh...
black ginger.
OTTO FRANK: No. Close.
Pim.
Your mother telephoned.
She was quite worried.
You should've gone
straight home.
What are you doing?
Mr. Kugler is trying out
some new reipes.
Your mixing stilI needs work,
but you may have something.
That's high praise
indeed, Mr. Kugler.
As you know, Mr. Van Pels
has an infallible nose.
Anne, a joke for you.
What is blak and white
and red all over?
What?
A newspaper.
VAN PELS: Yeah?
You know, read, huh?
ANNE: What a lovely book.
MARGOT: Thank you, Grandma.
ANNE: Was it exciting coming
all the way from Germany...
by yourself?
Tell me everything.
OTTO: Youu see? She's
still as curious as ever.
Let me see your book.
Let me see.
OTTO: Wait.
Grandma has another surprise.
And here's your present, Anne.
A fountain pen.
Look, Margot.
It's beautiful.
I'll treasure it always.
-Thank you, Grandma.
-You're welome.
I'm so glad you ame to visit.
Grandma will be living with us
from now on, girls.
-Would you like that?
-Oh, yes.
AE: Very muh.
Anne...
why don't you try out
your new fountain pen?
Yes, I must--immediately.
-Exuse me.
-Don't be too long.
The Goslars are expeting us.
Make sure she gets ready.
OTTO: Let her have
her fun, Edith.
You spoil her terribly, Otto.
She should've ome
straight home.
AE: Oh, I'm starving.
And please mind
your manners, Anne.
I know--like Margot.
I thought you liked the Goslars.
Of ourse I do.
I just wish Hannah Lee's family
wasn't so religious.
I'd rather be at the movies.
ALL: Amen.
Hitler's only a fever, Hans.
Germany will reover.
Mark my words.
And what's to keep that madman
from annexing Holland...
and liberating
his Germani brothers?
The Duth are different.
Sometimes, Otto, I think you
have too muh faith in people.
EDITH: Poor mother.
She's used to better.
MRS. GOSLAR:
God willing, Edith.
One day, we'll allgo home.
Until then, we get by.
Be thankful you've got
entral heating.
Let me help you with those,
Mrs. Goslar.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Suh a sweet girl.
You're luky.
Hannah's got two left hands.
Sometimes I miss
a full-time servant...
EDITH: but we don't have
money to pay servants.
The Dutch ones
are hopeless anyway--
simply annot be relied on.
Mother?
HANNAH: Anne says you shouldn't
call them servants.
Say, "maid."
God knows everything, but Anne
knows everything better.
OTTO: Youu like
to spoil yourself
Youu like it even better
when otherpeople spoil you.
Does that make me a bad person?
Good people and bad people
have one thing in ommon.
They both make mistakes.
Only...
good people an admit
their mistakes...
and learn from them.
Tell me about the Paulas.
That's a story for hildren,
not a little woman like you.
o.
I want to hear it.
OTTO: The Paulas
live here with us.
You an't see them...
but sometimes if you
keep absolutely still...
and really listen...
you can tell
where they're hiding.
BOTH: But beware.
Beause you never know
whih Paula you might find.
OTTO: Good Paula...
or bad Paula who's
always causing trouble.
ANNE: I don't mean
to be bad Paula...
but sometimes...
sometimes she just esapes.
Doesn't matter.
As long as you always keep
good Paula in your heart.
Daddy, ouldn't they
be the same person...
good Paula and bad Paula?
Why...
Yes. I suppose that's possible.
Maybe good Paula's afraid...
of what people
may think of her...
and that's why
she's bad sometimes.
At least that's what I think.
You always told me l
should think for myself.
So I did.
OTTO: The papers say Hitler
has his eye on Poland now.
Holland will stay neutral
whatever happens.
OTTO: Still, all this Nazi
talk, bad for business.
FRITZ: I have fewerpatients
now, but no matter.
There will always be
Jewish avities to be filled.
Ha ha.
Say ah.
Ah.
Ah, ah, ah. Ah.
Mr. Pfeffer.
ot until we're married.
Ha ha ha.
Wait!
It's not fair! You heated !
Anne! Come out of the water!
Otto, say something.
Anne, do as your mother says.
MAN: Play nicely
with your sister.
You know it's not good
for you to go swimming.
Here. Dry yourseIf off.
You never let me have any fun.
I don't want you getting sik.
You know how frail you are.
Ahh.
Were we ever like that, Edith?
o, Otto.
We were never like that.
GIRL: Oh, you're so funny!
Hey!
HANNAH: Youu took my strawberry.
OTTO: Look at my
two little movie stars.
Hee hee.
Would you like anything else?
Why was I not invited
to this party?!
ANNE: It's Mr. Goslar.
Look, it's your dad.
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha !
GOSLAR: Youu see?
And you told me he'd never
ome to Holland. Ha ha ha.
Happy birthday, Anne.
We must have a piture.
A piture, please.
-HAAH: Yes, Daddy.
-A piture?
-AdoIf as your birthday present?
-
The girls and Unle Adolf.
Hannah, point to your dad.
Everyone point to Unle Adolf.
It's very good.
FILMANNOUNCER:
Germany invades Poland...
and the free state ofDanzig...
ending the efforts
and hopes ofdiplomats...
forpeaceful settlement.
The roar ofgunfire replaces
the talk ofstatesmen...
and the curtain of war
falls over Europe.
Get out!
Order of the Swastika !
Lousy traitor!
-Boo!
-Sit down!
ANNOUNCER: ...huge French guns
move to the front.
-When will the piture start?
-Soon, Anne. Soon.
ANNOUNCER: The nation's
first bulwark ofdefense.
ANNE: Wasn't
Norma Shearer beautif ul?
Much too pretty
to lose her head.
I didn't like the king
very much, though.
Tyrone Power
was muh more handsome.
Just like the boy
I'm going to marry.
You've already hosen?
Oh, no. Too many admirers.
Just like poor Marie Antoinette.
The war won't ome here,
will it, Daddy?
o.
I don't think I'd
like that very muh.
Oh, Anne. The British
wilI see to Herr Hitler.
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Violating
repeat proclamation...
ofHolland's neutrality
in the current conflict...
German troops...
What is it?
Anne!
What do you think you're doing?
MA: Well, grab one.
I ask you, Mr. Gies...
what good is the Dutch army
in the face ofa Blitzkrieg?
They'll be riding to
the front on bicycles.
I wish I ould
disagree with you...
but I'm afraid I an't.
AUGUSTE: All this talk
ofan invasion is nonsense.
Why haven't they?
What's stopping them?
HERMANN: Why don't
you stay out ofit?
I'll do the thinking,
if you please.
AUGUSTE: Ha. Mr. Frank
listens to his wife.
You see what he's like?
Knows all the answers.
Beware of marriage, Mr. Gies.
In my experiene, its merits
are greatly overrated.
Hear, hear.
My sister begged me to send
the hildren to London...
-to live with her.
-And will you?
How an I keep them safe there?
It's better if we stay together.
Hope for the best.
Ah, here's a joke for you.
-We've heard it.
-Ha ha.
Five days was all it took.
ow people are throwing
themselves out of windows.
Where does pani get us, Hans?
We learn to adapt.
We adapted in Germany.
I wanted my baby to be born
in a different world.
ot like the one we left.
It's Frankfurt all over again.
o. I mustn't let
myseIf think that.
ot now.
I have a friend
who installed yesterday.
Very good, very good.
ls that good?
ext. Come on. Keep moving.
ext in line.
What's going on, Pim?
Why do we have to be here?
It's just a formality,
Anne, like a ensus.
You know, bureauray.
Anneliese Marie Frank.
Otto--Otto Frank.
WOMAN: Katherine!
LUCY: Anne, Hannah,
wait for me.
ls this her? She's adorable.
Her name's Gabi.
I'm still not used
to having a sister.
She keeps me busy all the time.
You mustn't spoil her, Hannah.
o one likes a spoiled hild.
I'm not sure if I are
for your outfit, Luy.
If you don't mind me saying so.
Mother makes me wear it.
She said we should
show some allegiane...
whatever that means.
Papa's been out of work
for so long.
Mother said Hitler
would make jobs here...
the same way he did in Germany.
WOMAN: Lucy!
What are you doing?
Get away from those girls!
OTTO: Not to worry,
Mr. Kleiman.
We'll beat the azis
at their own game--
paperwork.
Beause Petaon is registered
as a Jewish business...
it's neessary to reate
an entirely new ompany...
and with
yourpermission, Jan...
I'd like to call it
Gies and Company.
Whatever I an do to help...
but you must be areful,
Mr. Frank.
The bureaurats are
silent ollaborators.
You'll be listed
as supervisory diretor...
but no responsibilities.
Mr. Kugler will take over
day-to-day operations...
along with Mr. Kleiman.
lt'll be a purely
Aryan enterprise...
all stritly legal.
On paper, I won't exist.
MA: Brian, bring
your wheelbarrow!
ls there something
wrong with us, the Jews?
o. o, you must
never think that.
We must've done something awful.
o.
I was a little girl like you
in Vienna when the war ame...
and there wasn't
enough food to eat.
One day, my mother
bundled me up...
and she took me
to the train station.
She put me on
a train to Holland...
she hung a sign around my nek,
and she said good-bye.
Didn't she love you anymore?
Yes, she did.
That's why she did it.
There was food here...
and families
willing to share it.
I didn't know that at the time.
I felt so sik and so alone,
but when I got a little older...
I realized good people sometimes
find themselves in trouble...
without having
done anything wrong.
Do you think
I'm a good person?
Yes. I do.
MIEP: Only one?
We'll get another one later
when times are better.
This one's yours...
to prove that someone's
finally going to make...
an honest Duth woman
out of you.
I'm already honest.
Miss Santroushitz?
Your turn.
Oh ! I do, I do!
Ha ha ha !
MINISTER: I nowpronounce you
man and wife.
AUGUSTE: More dancing!
MAN: Music and champagne.
Who isn't?
You have two left feet.
Gone.
ANNE: Youu dance divinely, Miep.
-Oh, thank you, Anne.
-You, too, Jan.
She leads. I just follow.
May I see your ring
again, please, Miep?
I want one just like it
when I get married...
and a husband like Jan, too.
You'll find him. I did.
May I?
Oh, please, Curly.
Just one more dane.
Oh, sit down, please, Putti.
You'll only make
a fool of yourself.
Surely you wouldn't refuse
a lady's invitation, Mr. Frank.
Well, I'm afraid
that at the moment...
you have a rival,
Mrs. Van Pels.
Mademoiselle.
Charmed, sir.
TEACHER: The name ofthe man...
who disovered the basi laws
of geometry was Pythagoras.
TEACHER:
Write it down, please.
P-y-t-h...
a-g-o-r-a-s.
ANNE: Ahem.
Yes?
I'm afraid that
however interesting...
your lesson might be,
I an't see it.
Ah. Well, um...
you, will you hange
plaes with Miss, um...
Frank. Frank.
Change, please.
TEACHER: The square
on the hypotenuse...
AE:
I like your eyes, Jaque.
They're the first thing
I notied about you.
People say my hair is
my most attrative feature.
Do you think they're right?
Yes, of ourse.
You know, we live
on Merwedeplein.
It's not far away. You an
ome to my house if you want.
We an do our homework together.
I'd like that very muh.
So would I.
We're going to be
famous friends. I an tell.
At the Montessori shool,
I was very popular.
I ried when Mrs. Kuprus told us
we ouldn't go there anymore.
At my shool, there
were these awful boys.
They started alling us
Jew-girls.
We were so sared, we ran away.
AE: I don't know.
Maybe it's better this way.
Think about it. If it
hadn't been for the Germans...
we never would have met.
This is Moortje.
She's going to have
kittens soon...
beause she keeps
meeting lots of men.
Anne.
Mommy, would it be all right
if Jaque stayed over one night?
If she wants to.
Wait. I have a better idea.
I'll come over to your house.
We an talk about things
they don't want us to.
JACqUE: Youu want to see
something really magical?
Mother designed that.
The best people
used to wear her dresses.
She stopped making them
when the war started.
She thinks they're out of plae.
After the war, I'm only going
to wear the finest of lothes.
Miss Anne Frank was radiant at
the Prine's Ball last night...
wearing a beautiful gown
of gold lae.
Joop Ter Heul!
You've read it?
Three times.
I love Cissy Van Marxveldt.
She's my favorite writer.
Didn't you love the part
when Leo proposes to Joop?
Here. I'll be Joop
and you be Leo.
Hold my hand.
Let go of my hand, Leo.
What if I told you that you
were my one true darling?
Oh, Leo.
Kiss me, Joop.
Ha ha ha !
Jaque,
if I tell you a seret...
will you promise
not to tell anyone?
I promise.
I've never been kissed
by a boy before.
Have you?
What was it like, kissing?
lt was--
You'll find out.
I want to be a real woman
with a woman's body.
Ha ha ha !
I'd love to know what one
feels like. May I?
o.
But we're best
friends, aren't we?
JACqUE: Ofcourse we are.
We'll always be best friends.
If one of us
ever has to go away...
let's promise
to exhange letters.
Promised.
TEACHER: We measure the
circumference ofa circle...
in which
the formula 2 Pi r--
Write it down, please.
TEACHER: quite the chatterbox,
aren't you, Miss Frank?
Well, perhaps you'd like
to share your wisdom with us.
A little essay,
perhaps, entitled...
Quak, Quak, Quak
Went Mrs. Quakenbush.
TEACHER: Let's say 500 words.
Due tomorrow.
Ugh. These blakout drapes
make everything so stuffy.
I feel as if I'm
suffoating sometimes.
It's all in your head.
AUGUSTE: Youu know
that isn't true.
I'm a very deliate
reature, Mr. Frank.
Very deliate.
I tell you, the Germans
will lose this war.
And I keep asking you when?
We must be thankful
for what blessings we have.
Blessings? Otto, really--
Our families are still together.
That's enough.
Attention, everyone.
Ahem. "Quak, Quak, Quak,
Said Mrs. Quakenbush.
"A story by Anne Frank."
Go ahead, Anne.
We're all listening.
ANNE: "Once upon a time
there was a mother duck...
"and three beautiful duklings
who lived in a lake...
"ruled by a proud swan.
"Quak, quak, quak, said
Mrs. Quakenbush to her brood.
"Quak, quak, quak,
said the duklings.
"Keep your voies down !
roared the swan...
"his feathers
all in a ruffle.
"Be quiet, or I'll bite you and
then you'll never quak again.
"This swan was not a nie swan.
He was a blak swan...
"and all the other duks in
the lake were afraid of him...
"but not Mrs. Quakenbush.
ANNE: "Youu won't
bite these children...
"she said to the swan...
"who answered,
I'll do exactly what Iplease.
"They're only
ugly little ducklings...
"and I am their master.
"And then he began
to bite the ducklings.
"Save us, mama ! The poor
little duklings ried...
"and then Mrs. quackenbush
began to quack.
"She quacked, and she quacked,
and she quacked.
"Stop it! Stop that infernal
quaking, ried the swan...
"putting his wings
over his ears...
"but Mrs. quackenbush
did not stop...
"not until the black swan
flew away, never to return.
"She gathered
her ducklings around her...
"and together they swam off
happily ever after...
"singing,
quak, quak, quak."
Right up here.
I've been thinking.
lt might be a good idea...
to take over
the building behind us.
I'll show you
what I have in mind.
It's two rooms
and the bathroom below...
an atti upstairs.
It's a perfet laboratory
spae, wouldn't you say?
A plae
for Mr. Van Pels and me...
to ook up
our little experiments.
-What do you say?
-Yeah. Why not?
Business is good. The war.
We an afford to expand. Yeah.
MAN: There you are. Next.
The Germans are feeling
espeially generous today.
Four stars
for a single textile oupon.
Must we be branded now, too?
OTTO: So it appears.
And we must pay
for the privilege.
Aren't you going to miss shool
now it's almost over?
I am. Espeially history.
I love history.
Suh a long walk to the Lyeum.
I miss having a bike.
ANNE: Personally,
I'm glad mine was stolen.
At least the Germans
didn't get it.
Oh, Miss Quakenbush !
BOTH: Quak, quak, quak!
Quak, quak, quak!
They an be so hildish
sometimes.
Look. lsn't it darling?
I asked Daddy to buy it for me
for my thirteenth birthday.
It's going to be the best ever.
The most smashing.
Oh, sorry.
Um, you're Anne Frank.
You go to shool
with my ousin Wilma.
I'm Hello.
Hello Silberberg.
Oh, hello...Hello.
Ha ha ha.
This is my best friend Jaque.
How do you do?
Perhaps you'd allow me
to buy you a hot hoolate?
I love hoolate.
Choolate?
ls your name really Hello?
Helmuth, but my grandfather
doesn't like it...
so he alls me Hello instead.
But don't your parents think
it's funny?
I don't know. I haven't
seen them in four years.
You ame all by yourself?
lt must've been so--
so dangerous.
I've never had an adventure
like that before.
I suppose Oma did...
but she never
talked about it muh.
She died last winter.
She had aner.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I never got to tell her
how muh I loved her.
I'd like very muh
to see you again...
if that would be all right.
You don't have a girlfriend,
do you?
Well, there's Orzula, of ourse.
She's very pretty.
Oh, really?
But not as interesting
as you are.
We an meet
on Wednesday evenings.
My grandparents think I go
to woodarving lessons...
but atually
I go to silene meetings.
I'm not a fanati or anything.
You know,
mostly everyone just yells.
I'd muh rather be with you.
Well, here I am.
I an all for you then?
That would be nie.
Until Wednesday, then.
Bye.
Good-bye.
Aah !
Come in, Miep.
Sit down.
You've no doubt read...
how the Germans have emptied
the provines of Jews...
and sent them all here
to Amsterdam.
Our own Jewish ounil
urges ooperation.
There's talk of
mass deportations, labor amps.
Remember those poor boys
they rounded up last February?
They were sent to labor amps.
ot one ame bak.
Miep, I have a great seret
to onfide in you.
Edith, the hildren, and l
are going into hiding.
Mr. Van Pels and his family
will join us.
I'm not going to wait
for the Nazis to drag us away.
We'll simply disappear.
Where will you go?
Here.
MIEP: I don't understand.
In the annexe
at the bak of this building.
We'll make the move
on the sixteenth ofJuly.
That's less than a month away.
Kleiman and Kugler
have been helping...
to move in ertain belongings
and supplies a little at a time.
We'lI need someone
to rely on for necessities...
to act as caretaker.
You know how muh I trust you
here in the offie...
but what I'm asking--well,
what I'm asking of you now--
Yes. I'll do it. Of ourse.
Think, Miep.
lt'll be a great burden,
not without risk.
The penalties
are bound to be severe.
I said yes. I meant it.
Thank you, Miep.
Anne and Margot, do they know?
o, not yet.
Let them enjoy their lives
for a little while longer.
Pim. Thank you, Pim.
Thank you so muh.
Thank you, thank you, Pim.
Oh, I love you, Daddy.
It's beautiful.
Thank you so muh. Thank you.
She's just exited.
I'm sure.
Quite a glamour girl,

The soles
are almost like real leather.
You're so luky.
I know. Ha ha ha.
Anne, who's that boy?
ANNE:
Um, that's Peter Van Pels.
He's always
hammering something out...
in the garden behind us.
He's a dope.
Mommy says
I have to be nice to him...
'cause his father
works with Pim.
-I think he's ute.
-Cute?
Peter, would you like a bisuit?
-Um...
-Anne baked them herself.
Great.
I'd love one, thank you.
-Come in.
-Thank you.
I'll get Anne.
-Hello.
-Hi.
Good afternoon, everyone.
OTTO: Take your seats.
Everyone.
The show is about to begin.
Oh, Anne, those are for you.
-Thank you.
-You're welome.
I know what you're thinking...
but I'm not in love
with anybody.
We're just friends.
HELLO: My grandparents
don't approve ofmy seeing you.
They say you're not old enough.
Well, you shouldn't

your grandparents
don't approve of.
Love always finds a way.
I'lI see you later, then.
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.
Margot,

He's--he's very nie.
And deent.
It's easy to see
he's in love with you.
Yes.
It's rather fun.
How old were you
when you got your period?
Anne? Little girls
shouldn't talk of suh things.
I'm tired of being
a little girl.
I want to be a woman.
Well, it's different
for every girl.
Woman.
Your turn will ome.
You just have to be patient.
For how long?
-Frank?
-Yes.
Sign here.
Margot.
I have to go over
to the Van Pels'.
Don't answer the door until

Why? What's the matter?
Your--your father's

Don't worry. He's made plans.
I'll ome bak
as quikly as I an.
Anne has to be told.
Break it to her
as gently as you an.
And remember,

They're to think no one's home.
-I understand.
-All right.
MARGOT: Anne.
Come in, sit down.
AUGUSTE:
What's happening?
They've ome for Margot.
We always thought
they would ome for Otto or me.
But never the hildren.
HERMANN: Where's Otto?
Visiting some friends
at the Truat hospital.
I planned for the sixteenth,
but this hanges everything.
Otto will know what to do.
Daddy. I thought
I'd never see you again.
Oh, don't be silly, Anne.
What's happened?
Anne, listen to me.
I want you and Margot
to pak a ruksak.
There won't be any time
tomorrow.
-Daddy, what's going on?
-I'll explain everything later.
-ow go.
-Come on.
Call Mr. Kleiman.
He has instrutions.
Feth Miep and Jan.
Have them ome around, and...
see you're off the streets
by urfew.
AE:
These pitures are important.
Anne, I know it's hard, but
you have to try and be sensible.
I don't are.
My stars mean everything to me.
Jaque's on the phone.
-Jaque?
-Yes.
And remember...
Hello, Jaque?
JACqUE:
Anne, you won't believe it.
Joop's got a baby now.
Did you ever think
she'd become a mother?
Who?
Joop. Joop Ter Heul.
Haven't you seen the new
Cissy Van Marxveldt book?
I'm almost halfway through.
lt sounds divine.
I'll come up tomorrow.
We can read it together.
Youu can be Joop,
and I'll be Leo...
just like the last time.
All right.
I'lI see you tomorrow.
I can't wait to show you
the cover.
It's so darling.
I have to go now.
Our guests are here.
-Good-bye, Jaque.
-Yes?
MIEP: Miep and Jan.
Right through here.
Go on, now,
finish paking your lothes.
Jan.
Mr. Frank, here, let me.
Mm-hmm.
Jan, help Mr. Frank.
OTTO: This'll put people
off the trak.
If anyone inquires...
tell them
that we've gone to Switzerland.
Oh. Post this
to my mother in Bautzen.
You understand.
You know what to do.
Tomorrow.
How long will we be in hiding?
A few weeks.
Perhaps a month or two.
Until the war's over.
Where will we go?
Will it be in town?
-The ountry?
-You'll know tomorrow.
We'll all be together.
That's the main thing.
Will I be able to write
to Jaque?
She must never know.
Moortje?
Can I take Moortje with me?
I'm sorry.
OTTO: We'll leave some food
and a note for the neighbors.
It isn't fair!
o. o.
EDITH: Don't worry.
We'lI see you soon.
MIEP: Hurry, Margot,
before it gets light.
MARGOT: Bye.
OTTO: Please...
bak inside, everyone.
Everything will be fine.
You'lI see.
Edith.
Leave everything.
Moortje.
We an't live in the past,
Edith.
Only the future.
Hmm?
OTTO:
Anne, quickly, please.
MA:
I'll speak to my brother.
And Margot?
-She's waiting here.
-Oh, thank God.
ANNE: DearJacqueline...
Youu're the only person I can
tell about what happened...
But you must promise
not to say a word to anyone.
Don't answer any questions
about where we've gone.
Ifyou do, it could be
very dangerous for us.
Since you've never
had to disappear...
I'll try to give you an idea
ofour life.
I call our hiding place
"the secret annexe. "
And strange as it may seem,
it's actually quite cozy here.
Youu'd be surprised
to find out...
that we'rejust above
Daddy's office.
Up the back staircase
and behind a small door.
Open the door,
take one giant step...
and voila.
Daddy and Mommy's room
is right behind the staircase.
Margot and I reside next door.
We've even got a bathroom.
Upstairs, there's a larger room
with a kitchen.
The Van Pels
sleep there at night...
but during the day,
it's a big living room.
We have to stay upstairs...
as long as the workers
are still in the building.
Peter Van Pels
has a room offto the side...
much smaller than mine.
And there's an attic
for storage.
There are warehouses
on both sides of us...
and neighbors all around.
We have to be invisible
day and night.
ANNE: At first,
it was only Daddy and me...
doing most ofthe work.
Mummy and Margot eventually
got over their shock...
and started to help.
Shirts.
It was amazing to see
how many ofour things...
Daddy had managed
to sneak away.
I wasn't the only one who
brought my memories with me.
Daddy kept
his old soldier's trunk.
It was hard for all of us...
not to think about the life
we had left behind.
I miss my old room...
but at least I have my movie
stars to keep me company.
With a little luck...
we can all be happy here
until we go back home.
And now our annexe
really is secret.
Mr. Kugler and Mr. Kleiman
had a bookcase built...
in front of
our little doorway.
Youu have to be careful
when you go downstairs...
to bend down low
and try not to bump your head.
Everything was ready...
by the time the Van Pels
arrived on July 13th.
-They're here.
-Well done. Come in, ome in.
I need oxygen.
Well, I told Mr. Van Pels...
that I'm not going anywhere
without my little potty.
ANNE: Peter Van Pels...
dope that he is,
brought his cat...
even though Daddy
told him not to.
Mrs. Van Pels asked me
to love Peter like a brother.
That's impossible.
Mommy says he's shy,
but I think he's rather boring.
Now we're to have
anotherguest.
The other day,
Daddy announced...
we have an opportunity to save
one ofour acquaintances.
Mr. Pfeffer has asked me
about a hiding plae.
ow, we know this will
only add to your worries...
so the final deision
rests with you.
It's just as dangerous
for seven as it is for eight.
So we're agreed.
ANNE:
From what we can tell...
Mr. Pfeffer
is quite congenial...
for a dentist anyway.
That's all I had better
write for now.
I'm sure we'lI see each other
again, Jacqueline...
but probably not before
the war's over.
Until then, a little kiss
from your best friend, Anne.
-Good morning, Miep.
-Good morning, Mr. Frank.
Good morning, Miep.
Here you are.
Some igarettes,
if you don't mind, Miep.
And some peppermint tea.
I've been having...
the most frightful
dizzy spells lately.
Things are harder and harder
to ome by.
Whatever you an do
will be fine, for all of us.
ANNE:
So, Miep, what's the news?
Have you seen Jaque?
I have a letter for her...
but Daddy won't let me
give it to you.
When I finish with the shopping,
we'lI have our talk.
And what of our friend
Mr. Pfeffer?
He an't ome tomorrow.
He has patients.
The idea !
-What nerve.
-Tomorrow's Friday.
Tell Mr. Pfeffer
we will expet him Monday.
That'll give him time
to settle his affairs...
but not a day later.
I'lI see to it.
Miep, you remember one
of our salesmen, Mr. Wihtor.
Mm-hmm.
May I take your oat?
How are sales?
-Oh, what? Bad.
-Mm-hmm.
Through the summer, very bad.
I hear that...
Noir.
Noir.
Noir.
Oir, oir.
Blak.
Ah.
AUGUSTE: Oh, Mr. Pfeffer.
EDITH: Mr. Pfeffer.
But...you...
you're in Switzerland.
o, no, that was only a story.
-Hello, Mr. Pfeffer.
-Mrs. Frank.
-Welome.
-Pfeffer.
-Well, here it is, Mr. Pfeffer.
-ie to meet you.
Don't worry.
It's only like this...
when the workers downstairs
are out to lunh.
For the rest of the day,
it's quiet.
You'lI have to learn the rules,
of ourse.
There are sads of rules.
Mr. Pfeffer appreiates
the value of disipline.
OTTO:
Here idleness is our enemy.
Our motto: work and hope.
Listen to the Prussian offier.
Breakfast is at 9:00 a.m...
exept on Sundays and holidays
when it's 1 1 :30.
Lunh is from 1 :15 to 1 :45.
ANNE:
And then we expect visitors.
Visitors?
Our helpers, of ourse.
Here.
Thank you.
Dinner after
the nightly news broadasts...
and lights out promptly
at 10:00.
Parlez-vous Français,
Monsieur Pfeffer?
Oui, oui. Je parle un peu.
Comment ça va, madame?
What does that mean?
My poor Charlotte.
She thinks I've been
spirited away to the ountry.
Who would ever believe
that I'm right here...
in the enter of Amsterdam?
Would you like some more
vegetables, Mr. Pfeffer?
Thank you.
I think we're all
very fortunate here.
It's a ridiulous thing to say.
ANNE: I don't think
it's ridiculous at all.
It's a wonder
I don't ry all the time...
thinking about my friends.
Has she been taking
her valerium drops? Be quiet.
Putti,
you're spoiling my digestion.
Children know nothing
of what goes on in the world.
Hear, hear.
Where's my pillow?
What have you done with it
this time?
I ate it.
HERMANN: How am I
supposed to know where it is?
AUGUSTE:
Youu keep losing everything.
Here!
Your preditions
never ome true.
When have I ever been wrong?
When have you ever been right?
Anne in there with Mr. Pfeffer.
He's so old.
Anne's still a hild.
She won't mind.
We used to have suh fun before.
Before we were married,
you mean.
Ah, do you always take so long?
Only as long as I need to.
I have to have a word
with your father.
Don't touh me.
Listen to them.
Every night, the same raket.
lt would have been different
with the Goslars.
With two hildren
and a baby on the way.
We've been over this, Edith.
If the baby had ried,
what then?
lt would have given us all away.
This is no plae for a woman
as pregnant as she was.
At least I ould have
taken are of her.
I still an't believe it.
Mother and baby both dead.
Mother, don't.
lt would have been
different if...
if I had been there to help.
You don't know that, Edith.
That's just it, Otto.
I will never know.
You have to try not to think
of things outside these walls.
OTTO:
It's hard, I know...
but we an't be responsible
for everyone.
Just for ourselves.
-You mustn't do that.
-I an't help it.
I like wathing people.
Sometimes I make up stories
for them...
imagining
what their lives are like.
What ours would be like if...
MARGOT: Anne.
Margot,
don't I look different to you?
Different?
Anne, have you...
I wanted it to be my own sweet
little seret for a while.
I've only told Bep.
She fethed some things
from the hemist for me.
I'm happy for you, really.
If only people will just stop
treating me like a hild...
Are you busy after shool?
GIRL: Do you think they have
Jewish schools in Switzerland?
Of ourse they do...
but there aren't any Germans
to fore you to go there.
I still an't believe
she left her shoes behind.
She was so proud of them,
remember?
-You really saw them?
-Right on the floor.
Like she just kiked them off.
GIRL:
Did you see the diary?
-It was gone.
-But we looked.
TEACHER: I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, my--
my wife.
They took her away last night.
-He sent you this.
-You've seen Fritz?
Can't you even tell me
where he is?
I don't know.
-See that he gets this.
-Of ourse.
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.
Tell him I love him,
that I'll wait.
Mm-hmm.
Aah !
Damn you, you beasts.
CHURCHILL ON RADIO:
There've been disasters...
far more bloody...
than anything we have
experienced so far in this.
But in the end...
all the oppositions
fell together...
and all our foes submitted.
Can't stand to hear that man.
AUGUSTE: Halfthe time I don't
even know what he's saying.
This is not the end.
It is possibly
the beginning of the end...
and it is ertainly
the end of the beginning--
do you know
what that means, Mr. Frank?
Ah, Putti!
If you ask me, the British
should spend more time...
bombing Germany...
and less time drinking tea.
Shut up already.
Shh.
-Stop messing around.
-Try to fix it.
Every time you try to fix
something, it only gets worse.
The Amerians, Otto,
why don't they ome?
Why do they take so long?
They got their hands full
fighting the Japanese.
You mustn't despair, Edith.
The invasion will ome.
They'll be here soon.
Yes, but...will we?
Daddy, will you please ask
Mr. Pfeffer...
why he thinks
it's so unreasonable of me...
to insist upon me being able
to use my own desk?
I have important work to do.
Work, you understand?
PFEFFER: And besides, there are
otherplaces you can go.
This writing ofyours...
you can do it
in the attic, perhaps.
It's only a diary, after all.
-A hildish pastime.
-Childish?
ow, now, we needn't argue.
OTTO:
What Ipropose is this...
uh, Anne should have the desk,
say, twie a week...
from 4:00 in the afternoon
until 5:30...
and Mr. Pfeffer may use it
the rest of the time.
But, Pim...
Are we agreed?
OTTO: We alI have to make
small sacrifii s, Anne.
You mean me.
I have to make the sarifies.
And it isn't small.
I'm not a little girl anymore.
Mr. Pfeffer
has a right to the desk.
And don't I have rights?
I work just as hard
as anybody else here.
I just don't want that man...
poring through
my private thoughts.
That's easily remedied,
don't you think?
I have it.
Here.
This will keep your diary safe
from prying eyes.
Thank you, Daddy.
My little woman.
-Pardon me.
-Oh.
ever let it be said
that Anne Frank failed...
in her so-alled studies
on my aount.
Thank you.
My Pim !
Help me!
PETER: I think
they're bombing the airport.
Get away from that window.
Don't be afraid. Listen,
those are British planes.
-They're oming to save us.
-o, it doesn't sound like it.
Peter, ome down !
What are you doing?
ot everyone here
is an ex-soldier.
Aah !
VICTOR:
This is my partnerMr. Kleiman.
Pleased to meet you.
-Our indispensable Miep.
-Hello.
-And Bep.
-ie to meet you.
This is Mr. Van Maaren.
He will be taking over
as foreman.
At least until Bep's father
feels well enough to return.
I'm not muh for talk...
but if it's a hard worker
you're looking for...
-I'm your man.
-Fine.
Show Mr. Van Maaren
the storeroom, please, Bep.
I'll do it.
MIEP: Our salesmen give their
orders to Bep once a week.
Everything you need to fill
your orders is right here.
We have two kinds of Petaon
produts--spies and jams.
Wow, this would feth
a pretty penny...
on the blak market.
I wouldn't know about that.
Uh, your offie
is going to be in here.
What's this blue paint for?
Ah, that's to keep the spies
out of the light.
Hmm?
OTTO:
What does Miep think?
She doesn't trust him.
She thinks he's a thief.
A thief?
Ah, she's very protetive.
AE:
Shelling peas is so boring.
I an never be a housewife.
It's like being in prison.
OTTO:
It's only temporary.
Your father will be bak
soon enough, I'm sure of it.
o.
They say it's aner.
So muh suffering in the world.
ls that all you an say, mother?
That will only
make matters worse.
Honestly, I don't know how
you ould be so thik sometimes.
Anne! That's no way
to talk to your mother.
Don't listen to them, Bep.
You know what I do...
when things get diffiult?
I go upstairs.
ANNE: There's a window
in the attic...
where you can see the old
chestnut tree in the yard.
lt has the most wonderful
branhes.
When they're in full bloom...
it's beautiful.
When I look out...
I feel better somehow.
Makes me wonder...
if God is a lot loser
than most people think.
PFEFFER: Did you read that
in one ofyour books?
Suh a font of knowledge
you've beome.
I suppose I'm just hopeless.
Exuse me.
Don't you think you should
apologize to your mother?
She an be suh a trial
sometimes.
You're quite a trial yourself.
So people keep reminding me.
It's only natural
for a girl, um--
I mean,
a young woman of your age.
Stop!
I don't want to hear
that I'm like all other girls.
I'm not.
I'm me. Anne Frank.
Anne, your mother's
your staunhest defender.
I've heard her
with Mrs. Van Pels.
She's your friend.
I don't want her
to be a friend.
I need her to be a mother.
Someone I an look up to.
To set an example.
Your mother's
a kind, generous woman.
She's a dutiful wife, she's...
borne a great deal
without omplaint.
ANNE:
Youu always take her side.
But I've seen the way
you kiss her.
You kiss her the same way
you kiss me and Margot.
I think even
you're not in love with her.
ever say that.
You wouldn't want me to take
away your diary, would you?
Daddy.
I'm sorry.
ANNE:
I'm really, really sorry.
I just--
I an't help the way I feel.
Mommy and I...
we're so different.
We're like night and day.
She doesn't understand
anything about me.
Have you tried
to understand her?
Anne.
You all right?
I must have fallen asleep.
How long
have you been wathing me?
Oh, I've just ome up.
Honest.
Um, beans from the storeroom.
Everyone's gone now,
so it's safe to bring them up.
Mmm.
Mmm.
What do you think you're doing?
What's in that building
bak there?
lt does not belong to us.
ls that right?
You are supposed to be at lunh.
Get out.
Go.
Kugler's reords
are getting sloppy.
The urtains
in the front offie...
they're open again.
They're always open on weekends,
Mr. Pfeffer.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I forgot.
Then tell me,
how am I to ollet any papers?
Surely no one wilI see.
That's how it starts.
o one wilI see.
o one will hear.
o one will pay any attention.
Then what?
ANNE: Hello, Peter.
Hi.
Did you bring the bread?
Give me the keys.
I'll do it myself.
And get rid of that at.
You look ridiulous.
Like you're wearing one
of your mother's preious furs.
Dummkopf.
I think it's beastly
the way he treats you.
Don't mind him.
He gets like that when
he hasn't had his igarettes.
I like it when you smile.
Really?
Sort of makes your eyes sparkle.
You have pretty eyes.
o. I'm not pretty.
Yes, you are.
o, I'm not.
Well, you'll just have
to believe me, then.
MA:
Have you weighed this bunh?
Ah. I was wondering
where that had got to.
Thank you.
So it's your wallet, then,
is it?
I've just told you.
You were in the warehouse
last night?
That's right.
Why?
I don't have to explain myself
to you.
Didn't a ertain Mr. Frank...
work here in the offie
at one time?
A Jew?
What's that got to do
with anything?
What happened to him?
He...disappeared.
Disappeared?
That's right.
ow, if you'll exuse me...
If it's a reward
you're looking for...
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Oh, I got my reward all right.
Somebody living in that building
behind us. I know it.
My wife leans the offies.
If there were people hiding,
she'd know it.
She thought
she saw something one...
but he turned out
to be a salesman.
VANMAARSEN: Everybody's
hiding somebody these days.
What bothers me is that,
uh...they may be Jews.
Could be bad for all of us.
You think Kugler's in on it?
Kugler.
Kugler's a liar.
I know that already.
That whole bunh in the offie
is always sneaking around.
Kleiman says
he has to go to the storeroom...
the seretary's
always heking reords...
and the other one, that Miep...
something about her
I don't like.
She's shifty, that one.
What an you do?
Firing Van Maarsen
ould be dangerous.
If he suspets something...
there is a hane
he ould go to the Gestapo.
The reward for Jews has got up
to twenty-five gelders a head.
On the other hand,
if the fellow's stealing...
he's got something to hide
as well.
Yes, I think you're right.
We have to be more autious
from now on, all of us.
That was
our last hundred gelders.
What are we to do for money now?
One of those fany dresses
of yours...
should be worth something.
I'd like to see you try.
Stop being a ninny.
Then don't speak to me that way.
Whose fauIt is it
we're in this pikle?
Certainly not mine!
Would you please stop arguing?
You're like two magpies,
always bikering !
I don't see you offering
to help.
-Listen to her!
-Please, everyone.
Ausations aomplish nothing.
We'lI have
to fend for ourselves...
while you keep
all the money from the business.
Don't you think my Curly
deserves a share of that money?
Where would you all be
without his preious nose?
I tell you, still making jam !
See, I told you we should
have taken in the Goslars.
Oh, Edith, please.
ls that so?
Yes, it is.
Oh, Mr. Pfeffer,
would you mind waiting a moment?
Would you please relay this
to Mr. Van Pels?
Tell him...ha.
Tell him I await a response.
Oh, yes, of ourse.
If Mrs. Frank wants her linen
bak, she an have all of it.
I've never really ared for it.
To be honest, I've always found
it rather shabby, haven't you?
And from now on,
they an use their own hina.
See how they like that.
Thank you, Mr. Pfeffer.
Very well.
Be sure to put that
in the letter.
All right.
We'll teah them to put on airs.
Mr. Pfeffer, would you please
ask Mr. Van Pels...
to pass the salt to me?
Ha !
At least it was one of theirs
this time.
HERMANN:
Peter, get up here!
It's all right.
You shouldn't get into trouble
on my aount.
What do you think you're doing?
Sit down !
Look at yourselves.
You're supposed to know better.
How do you think
it makes us feel...
me, Peter, and Margot,
to see you behaving this way?
A fine example you're setting.
OTTO:
She's right, you know.
There's absolutely no plae
for pettiness.
Give me your plate.
Would you like soup or porridge?
Porridge, please.
Mr. Pfeffer,
would you be so kind...
as to pass this porridge
to Mr. Van Pels?
Ha ha ha. Mr. Frank.
Mr. Van Pels.
Have some vegetables, Margot.
Ah. Here's a joke for you, Anne.
What has four legs and flies?
Hmm?
-Tell me.
-Hmm? Ha ha !
A horse! Ha ha ha ha !
-What do you mean, a horse?
-A horse!
A horse an't fly.
A horse--
with the flies at the tail. Hmm?
Oh, don't be disgusting.
-Oh, Putti.
-I don't get it.
AUGUSTE: What do you mean?
VAN PELS:
A horse with flies on the tail.
Peter!
ANNOUNCER: It was announced
from the broadcast station...
at Cologne this evening that
the whole of western Germany...
is to be blacked out
until further notice.
Night raids have already
caused severe damage...
and President Roosevelt
has repeated his request...
thatAllied planes
refrain from bombing...
civilians
and unfortifii towns.
Look how fast I'm growing,
Daddy.
Twenty-three, twenty-four...
twenty-five, twenty-six...
Ah-hoo!
Mother says
you should drink this.
It's suh a bother
having the flu.
I'm afraid to ough
for fear someone might hear.
I like the bells.
I like to hear that
there is life waiting for us.
Margot, what do you miss most...
about outside?
I don't know.
So many things.
I long for everything.
ANNE:
I've decided something.
What?
After the war,
I'm going to live.
I'm going to travel...
study languages...
go to Paris or London.
Study history.
I love history.
That sounds romanti.
You think I'm too extravagant?
o.
I've been thinking, too.
I've been reading about
Palestine.
I'd like to see it...
maybe be a nurse there.
It's going to be different
for us.
We're going to be modern women.
This is very kind of you, Miep.
I wish there were more. There
are not enough ration oupons.
VICTOR: Youu don't need
ration coupons for this.
The supplier understandably...
wishes to remain anonymous.
FRITZ: Thank you very much.
ALL: To vitory.
-Thank you, Mr. Kleiman.
-You're welome.
You have no idea what
it's like for me, Mrs. Gies.
o one has any sympathy.
Least of all that girl.
FRITZ:
They have each other, you see.
I've no one. Only Charlotte.
Oh, thank you, my darling.
-Did she give you anything?
-Mm-hmm.
Oh.
Thank you,
and merry, merry Christmas.
-Happy new year.
-Thank you.
Anne.
MIEP:
Anne, I have something for you.
-For me?
-Mm-hmm.
They're beautiful!
I've never had high heels
before.
Well, I hope they fit. Here.
-They fit. They fit.
-They do? Wonderful.
Oh. Let me see you walk.
Here...
What a beautiful young lady
you've beome.
Do you really think so?
I do.
It isn't easy for me
to always look my best.
ANNE:
Peter thinks I'm sweet, though.
He told me so.
He said he liked my smile.
You have a lovely smile.
Miep, when you met Jan,
did you know?
Know?
Oh, yes!
I--I think I did.
When?
When he kissed me.
Has Peter?
Oh, no.
I keep wanting him to, though.
But I'm trying to be a lady
about it.
He will. How ould he resist?
AUGUSTE: Oh!
VICTOR: Oh, I like this.
JAN: Lovely.
Red shoes! Ha ha.
-Miep.
-What you doing?
-Putti.
-Curly, no!
Wait! Miep, how muh...
do you think something
like this would fetch?
Mr. Kleiman
has a furrier friend.
We an ask him.
He just wants money
for bloody igarettes!
You think food is heap?
You sold everything else,
my best dresses and jewelry.
Let me keep this at least.
Enough, Putti.
Anything you an do, Miep.
You see what it's ome to,
Mrs. Frank?
AUGUSTE: I won't have
any fine things left.
How am I going
to fae people...after?
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, everybody.
VICTOR: Merry Christmas.
Must you go, Miep?
Oh, Jan is waiting.
Just a little longer, please?
You hear how they all talk.
After the war.
I say nothing.
What ould I say to them?
Mrs. Van Pels...
everything a risis.
Who is she to ritiize?
The things she says
about the hildren...
the hildren.
Anne. Margot.
Otto says we must be hopeful.
Hopeful for what?
You mustn't think suh things.
I know.
I know I have to be strong.
But for how muh longer?
If only this waiting
would end.
At least I ould be ertain.
Miep...
we're not going to make it.
lt wilI have a bad end.
I'm sure of it now.
lt doesn't matter for me.
But the hildren...
The hildren, Miep--what's
to beome of the hildren?
HANNAH: Help me.
Anne.
Help me.
Help me.
-Hannah?
-Please, help me.
Hannah?
Pim?
I saw her.
OTTO: Who?
Hannah.
It was so awful.
The way she looked at me...
I was so mean to her
sometimes...
and now there's nothing
I an do to help her.
Why not? Please tell me.
It'sjust a bad dream.
ANNE: I hate them!
The Germans--they won't stop...
until they've killed
all the Jews, will they?
I wish all the Germans
were dead !
Anne, listen to me.
You must never think like that.
There are good and bad people
everywhere.
lt makes no differene
where they ome from.
What about Miep and Mr. Kugler?
They're Austrian.
Just like Hitler.
You want them to die as well?
o.
And...don't forget.
We are German.
o.
We're Duth, aren't we, Margot?
Of ourse we are.
I don't want to be German.
ot ever.
Here. Take your valerium.
lt will make you feel better.
o.
Pim...
let me sleep here tonight,
please.
OTTO: That's my girl.
Mr. Frank, ould you ome down?
Could you look at something
for me, please?
Oh, I'm desperate for a smoke.
Maybe Kugler forgot
some igarettes in the offie.
I'll join you.
Uhh !
Halt! Halt, you !
The polie are oming.
I need the toilet.
lt'lI have to wait.
You'll just have to hold it,
Margot...
for queen and ountry,
freedom, truth, and right.
This is no time for insolene.
What about the radio?
They're going to find the radio!
Psst! ldiot!
What differene does the radio
make if they find us?
I an still feel
your heart beating.
I thought we were lost.
I ould see the Gestapo
taking us away.
We're safe now.
Miep...
and Mr. Kleiman
will be here soon.
I prayed. Did you?
Mm-mmm.
I wouldn't have blamed God
if he didn't listen.
I never used to give him
a thought.
But he was wathing us.
I know it.
He's always wathing the Jews.
He always will.
Look.
I'm glad we're here...
together.
Me, too.
Listen, Peter.
Aren't they beautiful?
Mmm.
They're telling us things
are going to be all right.
Sure.
I must omplain in
the strongest possible terms...
about the new seurity measures.
I'm sorry, Mr. Pfeffer,
but downstairs is off-limits...
until further notie exept
for those with responsibilites.
FRITZ:
Youu can't keep us prisoners...
in this attic, Mr. Frank!
But we are prisoners,
Mr. Pfeffer.
one of us an afford another
enounter like the last one.
-ow see here--
-It's been deided.
ot by me.
If the Allies knew about
Mr. Pfeffer...
maybe they'd be here already.
We got--
And if we're not very areful...
there's going to be a wedding
on our hands.
Do you know what this is,
Hartog?
If you have mie...
you need a trap.
I know where they're hiding.
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
This is Armed Forces Radio.
Today is the day.
Today is D-day.
At 0630 hours, Allied forces...
under the command of
General Dwight D. Eisenhower...
landed on beaches
throughout Normandy.
Fighting is heavy,
but victory is assured.
To the people
of Western Europe, we say...
be strong, have faith,
stand firm.
ofyour liberation.
My girls, we made it.
Just think of it, Anne.
We'll be bak in shool
in Otober.
Shool.
-Hello.
-Hello.
I know there's going to be
a elebration later, right?
But I just want to be
the first to say it.
So happy fifteenth birthday.
Oh, thank you, Peter.
They're lovely.
Miep bought them for me.
Cost me everything I had.
It's worth it to see you smile.
What are you doing?
Can't believe I was so innoent
when I wrote some of this.
I'm trying to make it better.
I'm dreaming
of turning it into a novel.
Does it have a title yet?
Maybe the...
Blossomings
ofan Ugly Duckling.
Or The Seret Annexe.
You must say something.
Why make trouble?
Van Maarsen won't say anything.
He's got his reasons.
What about the neighbors?
Maybe they've heard something--
pipes, people talking.
-God knows what.
-I'm staying out of it.
They'll ath you !
They'll find out
you've been hiding from them !
Why didn't you report
when you were supposed to?
Have you thought about
what will happen?
Of ourse I've thought about it!
How long will you wait?
Until the Gestapo
omes to take you away?
What shall I do then?
Who ares about a bunh of Jews?
They've got it oming to them
anyway.
It's our lives
I'm talking about, Lemmert.
OTTO:
There's fig ing at Caen.
Aording to the reports...
won't be long now.
Do you think
it's suh a good idea...
your spending
so muh time in the atti?
Don't you think you should
do your homework in your room?
Daddy, you of all people know
what Mr. Pfeffer's like.
Your father's trying to say...
that you're spending a little
bit too muh time with Peter.
I don't understand.
Are we doing something wrong?
o, no. Um...
it's just, uh...
you enourage him
a little too muh, I think.
You should set limits.
Don't you like him?
I think he has potential, yes.
OTTO: But this is
the wrong environment...
for an infatuation...
and I must say I'm not ertain
I approve of all the neking.
I hate that word !
Just don't take things
too seriously.
That's all we're asking.
I think I'm old enough now
to make my own deisions.
Besides, he likes my smile.
Ever sine I was little...
I used to think my parents
had the perfet marriage.
I an't remember ever one
hearing them argue.
Daddy even used to serve Mummy
breakfast in bed.
I an't piture my father
doing that for my mother.
Probably hit him with the tray.
Or vie versa.
Mummy loves Daddy.
I'm sure of that.
But sometimes
I think Daddy married her...
beause he thought
she would be a good wife.
Do you see the differene?
I asked Daddy about it one.
You know what he said?
"Your mother's very dutiful."
Dutiful.
I want so muh more than that.
HERMANN: I say...
let the azis kill eah other.
Less work for the British
and the Russians.
This time next month...
We'll be having our Shabbat meal
in freedom.
This is not a meal.
This is garbage.
Your people ould be doing more
for us.
Mr. Pfeffer, how ould you
say something like that?
ANNE: Have you thought
about what would happen...
if Miep were aught with
one of your little pakages...
from Charlotte?
FRITZ: Now you even
begrudge me my Charlotte.
You think you're the only
lonely person in the world?
AUGUSTE:
Yes, those in glass houses...
What's that supposed to mean?
This modern household of yours.
It's the same argument
over and over again.
Some people never learn.
You ould afford
to take some lessons, too.
You're selfish, you're
hysterial, and you're pushy!
I am not pushy!
As if you were
some ideal mother--
you an't even ontrol
your own son.
HERMANN: Wait a minute!
-Just please be quiet!
-Sit down !
Stop telling me what to do!
Somebody's been a bad influene.
I'm proud of you.
I suppose
I just finally had enough.
It's a beautiful story.
Do you really think so?
Everyone would be amazed to know
that you had this in you.
People would just think
I was being silly--or worse.
Margot,
do you remember the stories...
Daddy used to tell us
about the two Paulas?
Of ourse.
Good Paula and bad Paula.
Everyone expets me
to be bad Paula...
so I try not to disappoint them.
Good Paula's just for me.
I keep her here.
I don't let her out in publi.
Well...
why not show them
who you really are?
The good Paula's
not strong enough.
She hides and lets
bad Paula do the talking...
exept in my diary.
Well, whihever one of you
wrote this...
I think it's very fine.
You know, you are old enough
to know by now.
There's no harm
in being yourself.
I try, Margot.
Really, I do.
It's just other people
keep getting in the way.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Just a seond.
Hello?

MIEP: Go now. There's no guard.
OK.
Go.
Go.
There's still time.
You an go, too.
o. I stay.
It's all right, Mr. Pfeffer.
You'lI see her again soon.
I'm sure of it.
Oh, Anne.
What's in this trunk?
othing of any value--
not to you.
Memories.
This is a soldier's trunk.
Where did you get it?
It's mine.
Yes. I was a reserve offier
in the first World War.
But...
But why didn't you
register as a veteran?
SERGEANT: Youu would've been
sent to Theresienstadt.
You would've been
treated deently.
Take your time...
Lieutenant.
Finish your paking.
MA: lnside.
You, in here.
Miep, see that
you stay out of it.
Salvage what you an.
The Gestapo's here.
Get rid of these.
I think he's from Vienna.
Go, go, go!
I'm ready, Pim.
So, you have nothing to say?
Either one of you?
o. othing.
Well, now it's your turn.
You're from Vienna. So am I.
I heard it right away.
Papers?
You get out.
Gies.
Like the name
of the business, yes?
Strange that your husband
isn't here.
Have you no shame?
SERGEANT: What am I
going to do with you?
As far as I'm onerned,
you an stay here and rot.
Consider it a personal favor.
But if you leave,
we'll seize your husband.
You keep your hands
off my husband.
He has nothing to do with this.
It's my affair.
Don't be stupid. You're both
in this up to your neks.
SERGEANT: We'll be back
to check on you.
God help you if you're not here.
MAN: Bring them over here.
SECOND MAN: quickly, move.
MAN: All right, close it up.
SECOND MAN: Come on.

This is...Anne's diary.
Bep, help me pik this up.
Bep, help me.
VA MAARSE: Quikly,
before he omes bak.
Where have they taken them?
To Gestapo headquarters,
I should think.
After that...
-lt was so awful.
-Enough.
Aren't you going to read it?
o. This belongs to Anne.
When she omes bak,
I'll give it to her.
P.A.: Allprisoners proceed

No talking.
Allprisoners

No talking.
MAN: Seven, eight, nine, ten...

MA: Welome to
the Jerusalem of Holland.
Registration is at the far end.
Just follow the rowd.
MAN: We're allJews here.
The Germans
let us run the place.
That's "S" Barracks.
Watch out
you don't end up there.
The place is a little dirty...
but we've got
everything you need...
to make yourselfcomfortable...
and we've got lots of work
to keep you busy.
What are we going to do?
We're already filled up.
It's no good.
Things don't look so bad.
Make ourselves useful.
Stik it out.
MAN: Next.

Frank. Otto Frank.
This is my wife Edith...
and my daughters
Anne and Margot.
"S" Barraks.
OTTO: Ifl may,

that my daughters be
assigned to kithen duties.
I an do anything.
I'm very handy.
o privileges for riminals
of "S" Barraks.
OTTO: May I ask of
what crime we're accused?
Failure to report to an order.
ext.
-It's not a rime, sir.
-ext.
-It's not a rime, sir.
-ext.
lt doesn't make us
riminals, sir.
ANNE: So then FredAstaire
takes Ginger Rogers...
in his arms, and they dance
and dance and dance.
Wath it.
Work.
Before the war, she went
to every movie she ould.
I an't wait to see all
the pitures I missed.
Thanks to all the magazines...
she already knows
all the plots by heart.
They an't touh us.
I heard one of
the other women talking.
She said the Allies
have taken Paris...
and they're marhing
through Belgium now.
ls that the latest from the JPA?
What's the JPA?
The Jewish Press Ageny.
Every day, a different rumor.
JANNY: The Allies are
here, there, everywhere.
They say there hasn't been
a transport in two months.
-Maybe there's hope.
-There's always hope, Janny--
as long as we work hard.
That's my father's motto--
work and hope.
ANNE: And then Mrs. quackenbush
began to quack.
She quacked and she quacked
and she quacked.
"Stop that
infernal quaking..."
ried the swan...
and he put his wings
over his ears.
ANNE: But Mrs. quackenbush
did not stop--
not until the big
black swan flew away.
She waited to see if
the swan would come back...
but he never did...
so she gathered
her duklings around her...
and together they swam off
happily ever after.
And do you know what they sang?
ALL: Quak, quak, quak!
That's right.
"Quak, quak, quak."
They love your stories.
Do you think we ould arrange
for me to visit more often?
I'll try.
They don't have parents
to tell them stories anymore.
When we're liberated...
I'm going to get
all the paper I an find...
and start my stories over again.
Did I tell you
I was working on a novel?
o.
I don't think so.
Well, I was.
I didn't know how to finish it,
but now I do.
I an't wait
to get started again.
It's going to be a romane,
but not sentimental, mind you.
I've grown too old for that.
Do you remember
how you told me one...
how you were ashamed
of being Jewish?
Mm-hmm.
The hosen people.
Chosen for what? This?
We've suffered before,
and it's only made us stronger.
One day, people
will look up to us.
Yeah, if there are
any of us left.
I used to take
so muh for granted...
like the sky.
Do you see those stars?
We had a lub alled
the Little Dipper one--
Jaque, Hannah, Sanne, and me--
one star for eah of us.
And whih one were you?
That one.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I should've known.
Tomorrow, a transport
will leave this amp.
-Quiet!
-
The O.D.s are preparing lists.
lnmates seleted
for this transport...
will be allowed
to take with them...
all belongings
surrendered upon arrival.
I look forward to personally
seeing you off...
and wishing you bon voyage.
MAN: Back to your barracks now!
There must be
something you an do.
You've got to keep us
off their lists.
There isn't a string in this
amp I haven't tried to pull.
The only language
they understand is barter.
We've got nothing to trade.
I'm not sure it would do
any good even if we had.
The Jew traitors here
are worse than the azis...
saving their own skins.
In their plae, you'd
do something different?
Ach.
We're like Job, waiting in
the ashes while they play God.
o. lt was different for Job.
Job didn't have to squat
like an animal...
in front of strangers...
Job was not driven
from his homeland...
and Job ould argue bak.
Attention !
Get in line!
Step forward
when your name is alled.
Brandes, Janny.
Lubinsky, lsaa.
WOMAN: Brandes, Lientje.

WOMAN:

MAN: Van Pels, Peter.
WOMAN:
Van Pels-Rutgen, Auguste.
MAN: Pfeffer, Fritz.
Come outside there.
lt doesn't make any sense.
Anyone with brains an see
the Germans are losing the war.
What an we matter to them now?
othing makes sense
anymore, Mr. Pfeffer--
not to me.
As long as my family
stay together.
MAN: Stay together.
MAN: Come on, come on.
TEACHER: All right, now.
Do you have your report cards?
Let me see them.
Make sure you give them
to the teaher at the next amp.
-GIRL: Yes, I will.
-SECOND GIRL: We will.
CROWD: Ohh !
Still in Germany, I think.
I'm not sure.
Everywhere just looks
bombed to piees.
Well, it's something, anyway.
Maybe they bombed the traks.
That's possible,
isn't it, Mr. Frank?
Yes, it's possible.
I'm going to take off
the red pathes.
Wherever we're going...
we are not going
as ommon riminals.
BOY: No! Mama!
Aah !
Don't let go!
Peter! Peter!

SOLDIER: Hey, ome on !

Youu won't see them again.
They are in the gas chambers.
-EDITH: Don't listen to her.
-Shut up, you.
Unh.
Ahh.
Unh.
Aah !
Hmmph.

I'm staying with my daughter.
I have sabies, too.
SOLDIER: Move along.
I talked to Anne last night.
The dotor said they ould leave
that horrible plae.
When?
Today, she said.
And the sun is shining.
EDITH: It's dangerous
for them there.
I should've gone with them.
The sabies blok--
there has been a seletion.
The hildren?
WOMAN: Here. Here.
Margot, what has happened?
Aah !
This way.
ANNE: Lientje? Janny?
Anne?
JANNY: Margot.
Thank God.
Ohh.
Listen, Margot. Birds.
I've forgotten about birds.
You never saw them in Birkenau.
othing lived there.
Birds of prey.
Savengers.
That's all that's left.
That's the Star Camp.
They are saving those Jews...
to exhange them
for German prisoners.
They have food over there.
Better be areful.
If they ath you,
they'll shoot you.
I'll kill you,
you thieving bith !
Mrs. Van Pels?
AUGUSTE: Oh, to find you here
after all these weeks...
months...
Your mother was
beside herseIf with grief...
when she heard
about the transport.
She didn't ome with you?
Seleted.
AUGUSTE: Every day,
there were trains.
It was because ofthe Russians
is what I heard.
Only sixty miles away...
they're emptying
all the Polish amps.
We don't believe
in rumors anymore.
Oh, an't you make her stop?
Typhus.
You'll get used to it.
You get used to everything.
Anne.
Anne.
Anne, wake up.
There's somebody on

and I think
it's your friend Hannah.
-Hannah?
-Hannah.
The other side.
Hannah.
Hannah.
ANNE: Hannah.
Hannah.
ls it really you?
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be
in Switzerland.
lt was only a story so they
wouldn't ome looking for us.
We were hiding
in Daddy's offie.
I ouldn't tell anybody.
Gabi. ls she here?
She had an infetion,
but she's all right now.
Someone's taking are of her.
It's father I'm worried about.
HANNAH: He's so sick.
They took him to the hospital.
I pray for him every night.
I used to pray
for you, too, Anne.
HANNAH: Iprayed that
your family was safe.
I have no family.
Only Margot.
Youur father?
Youur mother?
My father's dead.
ANNE: They sent him
to the gas chambers.
But your mother?
Seleted.
The himney
was smoking so blak.
It's too horrible.
I an't believe it.
They've taken
everything, Hannah.
Everything.
ANNE: It's so cold here.
The lie are rawling
over my lothes.
There's no food.
Everything I find I give to
Margot beause she's so weak.
We got a Red Cross
pakage today.
It isn't muh,
but it's something.
Wait.
Anne.
I'm here.
I'll throw it over.
ANNE: Be careful.
Aah !

-Aah !
HANNAH:

HANNAH: Tell me!
She took it.

HANNAH: I'll try

Please try. Please try.
Yes, I promise. Tomorrow.

Oh, soks. Thank you.
Thank you so muh, Hannah.

HANNAH: Wait for me.

Me, too.
I have to go.
The guards. Until then.
Soks.
Put this in your mouth.
Mery...
o! Go away.
HANNAH: Anne?
Anne, are you there?
Can you hear me?
Anne?
I'm sorry I ouldn't meet you
the way I said I would.
They told us we were
going to be exhanged.
Finally, after all this waiting.
You should've seen father.
He got dressed in his best suit,
even in the hospital.
He...
he died in that suit.
And now they say we're not going
to be exhanged after all.
Why are they so ruel?
You're the only person
I have left to talk to.
You and Gabi, but she's not
old enough to understand yet.
I don't understand.
Oh, Anne. Where are you?
WOMAN: Anne?
What's happened?
Where are your lothes?
I threw them away.
I feel the lie
rawling all over me...
ithing--ithing all the time.
I'll try to organize

You have to ome.

Everyone's sik.

Tell me a story, Anne.
I used to...I used to
love your stories.
Pim's stories were always
muh better than mine.
Poor Pim.
Well, you're still going to be
a writer there, won't you?
And he'd like that.
Do you remember
how we talked about it?
About...about what
we were going to do...
after the war?
What were you going to be?
I an't--I an't remember.
Yes, you an. You have to.
A nurse.
That's what you told me.
That's right.
A nurse.

After we were liberated
by the Russians...
I found someone who had known
Edith in the women's amp.
Starvation.
She was hoarding bread under
her blanket in the hospital...
for her hildren and
her husband she said.
OTTO: Ifher body had only
held out for two more weeks.
I'm sorry, Mr. Frank.
The azis dynamited
the gas hambers, you know...
to over their traks.
That wasn't enough for them.
That's when the marhes began.
I begged Peter not to go,
to stay behind.
He was looking after me then.
I don't know
what happened to him...
or to Mr. Pfeffer.
Mr. Van Pels I saw
with my own eyes...
being taken to the gas hamber.
He was in the barraks
when he should've been at work.
He...
He just gave up.
And you an never do that.

And the girls?
Do you have any news?
Only rumors.
So many of the women
were deported to Germany.
I live in hope.
