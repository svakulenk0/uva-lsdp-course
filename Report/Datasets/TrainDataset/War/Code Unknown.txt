CODE UNKNOWN
Incomplete tales of several journeys...
Anne!
Jean? Hi...
What are you doing here?
Where's Georges?
Away.
Went 3 weeks ago.
Where to?
Kosovo.
Why? Has something happened?
What's your problem?
What's going on? What's wrong?
I'm not going back.
Why, if you don't mind me asking?
Look, I'm in a hurry.
Tell me what's wrong as we walk.
When's Georges back?
No idea.
You know what your brother's like.
Is it so urgent?
How did you get to Paris?
On the 1st train.
I've been here an hour.
What?
Your fucking door code's changed!
Why didn't you call me?
I got the answer-phone.
Sorry.
I need a place.
- Sorry?
- Here in Paris.
- How come?
- I fucked off.
You did?
I can't stand him.
Is that all?
He's doing up the old barn.
So? Hold on,
you must be hungry, too.
In the bath, I can't hear the phone.
What?
Forget it.
Aren't you hungry?
Now where were we?
Oh yes, what's your Dad up to?
He's renovating the barn.
So?
To live in when I take over.
So?
- So, I'm not staying.
- Really?
Why not?
Wasn't your dream to run the farm?
No, never. That was his dream.
Okay.
This isn't really the time or place.
I'll get Georges to call, okay?
I'm not going back.
You should know by now
you must do what your father says.
Later, you can make
your own mind up.
I already have.
We'll talk it through later,
now is not the time.
The show opened last night,
I got to bed at 4.30...
I just have time
to glance at our press...
...and in precisely 48 minutes,
I have an important meeting.
Go easy now on my poor little soul.
Here, take the keys.
The code is 48B13.
If you're tired,
you can stretch out on the couch.
I'll be back by 12.
Let's be clear:
you've seen my place...
...there's not room for 3.
Got that?
Remember the code?
See you later.
If anyone calls,
let the answer-phone get it.
What's with you?
Was that a good thing to do?
What?
Do you feel that was right?
Fuck you.
You stupid or what?
You're going to say sorry
to the lady.
Fuck you.
Let go of me!
Who the hell are you? Let go!
Now, say sorry.
Didn't you hear me? Say sorry!
Let go, you fuck!
It's beyond belief!
What's going on?
Clear off out of here! Hooligans!
Unbelievable!
Hold on, I can explain.
Don't go.
This young man humiliated the lady.
Just let go of me!
Let go of him! Are you mad?
Why are you picking on him?
Is it your problem?
Who asked your opinion?
Do you know what he did
at least?
Ask before you leap in.
- What's going on?
- He hit me.
- Typical...
- What?
He hit me!
Maybe you could tell her why?
Do you mind telling me
what's going on?
I don't see why I should...
But everyone seems interested,
so I'll tell you.
The lady... Wait there, please.
And you stay here!
Don't go sneaking off.
Get the fuck out of my way!
Let him go, for God's sake!
Stop... Calm down, Jean!
Break it up!
What's going on here?
What's he done?
They put on quite a show.
Wait, I can explain.
That's a smart idea.
I'll tell you
if you give me the chance.
This boy, this young man...
...humiliated a woman begging
outside the bakery...
What woman?
The one with the yellow bag.
Victor...
He threw a scrunched up bag...
Come here.
...sitting there,
putting off customers.
We're not inhumane, but...
- Thank you.
- Can we go?
You can come
and make a statement if you wish.
- Who'll look after...
- Can I have my ID?
ID!
Can I have my ID back, too?
I doubt it. What do you think?
Come along to the station first.
Understand?
Understand?
Good...
Take his details.
Please, this way.
I've done nothing wrong.
I'm coming of my own free will.
Don't make trouble.
You don't need to touch me.
I'll come, no problem.
If you don't comply,
I'll put the cuffs on. Okay?
Come on.
...In the vaulted cellar
of a badly damaged oil press.
Our group includes
Mark Henderson of Newsweek...
...myself and a dozen KLA fighters.
Originally,
we were aiming for Drenica...
...to meet up
with an even smaller group...
...but our plans changed.
I tried writing often...
...but gave up.
I didn't know what to say.
Outside, it's very quiet.
The firing stopped hours ago.
Waiting is the worst.
Antoine's 5 on May 11.
I hope to be back in Paris by then.
Eve promised
I'd have him for the day.
"Break a leg" for your play.
Chin up, it'll be crap.
You won't get this in time,
but you'll be great.
Sorry for my behavior
on our last day.
If you see Jean-Pierre...
Yes?
What?
I don't have time, I have a fare.
When?
What did he do?
How many cops came?
They took him away again?
Call Aystan and Meyssa,
I'm on my way.
Can you slow down, please?
Sorry, sir, I'm in a big hurry.
It's very important.
I don't want to end up in hospital
because of you.
Are you deaf?
I said, slow down.
Sorry.
What the...
I'm sorry.
I'll drop you at the taxi stand.
I don't believe this!
Sir, there's a taxi right there.
I'm very sorry.
There's absolutely no charge.
What a nerve!
Rokia?
Put your mother on.
You can leave that there.
Just dump it on the chair.
Leave your script there, too.
You know it, I hope?
Of course.
Great.
So we can go without a net.
We'll take it from
just after he locks her in.
The camera is the door.
You can play it straight at us.
Luc, ready to roll?
I'm ready.
Should I read his part?
That'd be good.
You hear him lock the door.
You go to make sure.
The door is indeed locked.
It's locked,
you will never get out.
Sorry?
You will never get out.
What do you mean?
I mean you will die here.
Is this a joke?
Not for me.
For you neither, I'm afraid.
Look at the ceiling.
Do you see the light fitting?
It's an inlet for gas lighting.
See now why I asked
if you had a lighter?
You could use it to blow us both up.
Okay, what do you want?
Nothing.
I have nothing against you.
Nothing at all.
I like you.
You just fell into my trap.
What do you mean,
I fell into your trap?
It means you're going to die.
I merely want to watch you die.
Please, stop now.
You've had your fun.
Now, let's forget all about it, okay?
I'm expected home.
I have no time for games.
Neither have I. Believe me.
Can you hear a whistling noise?
From the ceiling.
Soon, you'll be able to smell it.
Stop...
Stop, please.
Let me out! Please!
You're wasting our time.
What do I have to do?
Show me your true face.
What?
Your true face.
What do you mean?
What do you want?
I want to see your true face.
Not your lies nor your tricks.
A true expression.
What do I have to do?
Be spontaneous.
React to what's happening.
How?
Hello.
Beets. That's all there is.
...They turned the apartment
upside down.
We had a house full.
Everyone saw it.
The shame of it.
And your son?
He's a good boy.
He's never done any harm.
He's the eldest. He helps a lot.
He's a good boy.
I know...
They beat and shamed him.
May Allah punish them.
He did nothing wrong.
They had no choice
but to let him go.
They had nothing on him.
I don't know
who brought this upon him.
I cooked f. Y.
and took it to the homeless...
...but all my sacrifices are in vain.
I have no power.
You must protect him.
Do you have anything of his?
We must never forget
where we come from and who we are.
We are not sons of slaves.
Your son is a proud, honest boy.
His heart is pure.
But he sees a lot of whites,
as you know.
Someone disapproves
and wants him to return.
Return where?
Home.
To the land of his ancestors.
That's ridiculous.
Who could possibly want that?
I have no idea.
It's the same one
who bewitched Salimata...
...and made her mute.
What have we done to him?
Salimata's illness is different...
...While Lica and M.Rioara
delivered the calf...
Uncle Nelu gave instructions
on his mobile from Rome:
when to pull, how to cut the cord...
...rub the calf with straw...
It was their first time, you see?
Mobile phones are wonderful.
M.rioara's cousin, Georghe, has one.
He says that in some places...
...you can call without paying...
...because...
...there's some kind of trick, see?
I wouldn't know.
You've never used a mobile?
Only when someone lent me one.
But when you called home?
- Granny!
- Yes?
When you used to call home?
I used a public call box.
Nicu, go see where he is.
Maria!
...Cost half
what Vasile brought back.
There must have been 350-400 people
at the funeral.
From Cluj even.
He was an important man.
And they're self-important.
You'd rather they chuck
the old man in a hole?
What if we did that to you?
It's true, Mama!
You must respect people's labor.
You don't work for people to gossip.
Same for Dumitru.
But Papa keeps harping on.
Do Nuta and Nicu
like their father being abroad?
Not to mention me!
But you don't stop jabbering.
True enough.
Quiet now
so Mama can look round in peace.
Nicu, give me that chocolate.
That's your third bar.
Give it to me!
How many were there?
I don't remember. He's okay.
Give me that!
It's beautiful.
Very good.
Where did the couch come from?
Ciocan gave it to Dumitru
for helping out...
when he was home.
Lovely.
- Do you like it?
- Sure, it's fine.
Shame there's no chairs with it.
She has delusions of grandeur...
...but who knows
if she'll need all that.
Don't listen to him.
Sorin's parents said
they'd be better in his house...
...since ours won't be ready
for the wedding.
Of course,
his is bigger, better...
...and lots more besides.
- You don't like this one?
- Yes I do!
- But Sorin doesn't?
- He does.
It's not finished, that's all.
Of course...
They want to make us feel grateful.
Sorin's mother says Nuta
may be too young.
Women's tales.
His father gave me his word.
If they don't want the house,
Florica can have it.
Then, she might even find a man.
Shut up, Papa, you're drunk.
Hi, it's Georges.
Thanks.
Can you put Jacky on?
Hello, my man.
I called from the airport
but your line was busy.
Groggy, but I'm okay.
I'll be in tomorrow at 10.
How do the photos look?
Sorry?
Maybe 20 km from Drenica.
I wrote it on the roll.
She needs glasses.
Precisely!
When did he fly out?
Via Kabul?
Yeah, I heard it on the radio.
No, I was in Tirana at the time.
Anne's home.
I'll call you back.
You know where to get me.
See you tomorrow.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, miss.
You okay?
I'm okay.
I hope the bath doesn't overflow.
Me, too.
Hello, you.
Does the heating work?
It was totally overhauled
If you wish,
I'll show you the boiler.
Now we come to what was
the music room.
This way...
A superb room.
The paneling provides
excellent acoustics.
Very pretty.
Strange lighting, though.
Why are there no windows?
They're walled up and concealed.
For the acoustics, I guess.
Hold on...
Can you hear the silence?
Quite amazing with all that traffic.
What's behind this door?
A hallway to the stairs.
The key was lost.
I'll have a copy cut.
No, thanks, I don't.
Unfortunately, I do.
Maybe you have a?...
Sorry, no.
Excuse me.
My briefcase is next door.
I'll get a light and be right back.
She's too head-on to camera.
The mark fell off...
...during the pan...
Shot 16, take 4.
Action!
...Almost 3,000 square meters.
The trees and hedges
ensure total privacy.
So I see.
Shall we go on?
Everything is
in excellent condition.
The windows, doors, wallpaper...
The floor's been varnished.
Does the heating work?
It was totally overhauled
If you wish,
I'll show you the boiler.
Now we come to what was
the music room.
This way...
A superb room.
The paneling provides
excellent acoustics.
...Then, there's the inspector
who begins...
...to link the crimes
and build a profile of the killer.
He's helped by his own personality...
...being very similar to the realtor's.
What happens to you?
I can't tell you.
It'd spoil the surprise.
When's the film coming out?
No idea.
We haven't finished shooting yet.
Christmas, I guess, or the New Year.
I've truly no idea.
There you are, sir.
Bones all gone.
Thank you, miss.
What service! Look and learn.
Are you back from a war zone?
How does it feel, civilization?
I feel an urge to do my expenses.
Seriously?
Seriously, it's not too bad.
It's all so obvious. At first.
Then, the crunch comes.
Meaning?
I don't know...
Over there, it's simple.
Here, life is complicated.
There, it's hard at first.
Then you get into the swing of it.
Did you bring
your dentist's address?
Sure... You want it now?
No. So I don't forget.
It comes and goes.
It doesn't hurt now...
...but press and it's agony.
I know... I'll give you
the address afterwards.
- Seen Martin yet?
- No.
He's in a terrible way.
It's almost moving.
What happened?
Julie hit him with it.
She took the kids and moved out.
I called all morning.
I only arrived 2 hours ago.
Claudine...
...He could get off...
...except the captain
had his passport on board.
To disembark for a month
with his passport...
...he had to prove he had a job.
Ashore, he met a fellow Malian...
I booked a window table.
Mister Traore?
That's right, Amadou Traore.
I'll just check.
This is fine.
Let it go, we're here now.
If you want...
So?
So, what? Oh, right...
So the guy from Mali promises
to find him a job.
They ask the captain...
...to give back the passport
once he's hired.
The captain agrees.
panting as if he's run miles.
He says his boss will hire him...
...but needs his passport
to confirm his particulars.
The captain hands it over...
...but tells my father to stay put
as a guarantee.
Sorry, sir,
your booking was for 7.30.
It's now 8.15.
The window tables
are very popular...
It's 8.15 already?
Well, never mind.
Can we have the menu?
Coming right up.
Say...
...is that a watch?
Don't you like it?
So-so.
So, he had to stay on the boat?
Yes. The only way from his cabin
to the gangplank...
was past the captain's cabin,
whose door was wide open...
...so no one could leave unseen.
There was a bigger boat alongside.
Sorry.
It's not ours.
Isn't it?
If someone asks,
it's behind the bar, okay?
What are you drinking?
- How about you?
- Don't know.
Our house cocktail is light
and a real thirst-quencher.
Sound good?
- A cocktail and a Perrier.
- Fine.
So, what did he do?
He pulled on two pairs of pants...
...several shirts and sweaters...
...and left the rest.
He climbed ashore via the other ship...
...and got his passport back.
Cool!
My Dad can tell you stories
like that for days on end.
Have you chosen?
One cocktail...
...and a Perrier.
Found anything you like?
Not yet.
Take your time.
The kitchen closes at midnight.
...That you have to photograph
death and destruction...
...so I know what war is?
Starving kids
so I know what famine is?
What a dumb assumption!
Don't get worked up,
it'll ruin your meal.
We won't see eye to eye, Francine.
For you, it's theory.
For me, real life.
But you can't say that
in your photos.
True.
So, why do you do it?
Back on your favorite argument?
Why not?
If I can't attack my friends,
who's left?
Me, darling. I'm your punchbag.
Look over by the wall.
The black kid who hassled Jean.
Don't let him see...
Hi there, Maria!
Mihai Popa!
How are you doing?
Well. Very well.
So I see.
We do our best. And you?
I'm fine, too.
On your way home?
Jump in.
Don't worry.
It's on my way.
You have a big, heavy bag.
- When did you get back?
- A few weeks ago.
- And you?
- Last week.
- How's Mirela?
- Very well.
She nannies for a couple,
both doctors.
Where?
Dublin.
I look after the garden
and everything else.
I'm only here for shearing.
You've landed on your feet.
You could say.
What about you? How was Paris?
Fine.
Find a job?
A good one. In a school.
Great! How long did you stay?
- 4 months.
- Is that all?
I missed the children.
And Dragos missed you, eh?
We're here.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
Your house looks good.
- Is it finished?
- Nearly.
- When's the wedding?
- Spring.
Go on... Thanks again.
Are you going to Olteanu's wedding?
Ask Dragos.
If there's drink, he'll come.
It'll be good.
I hope so.
Say hello to Dragos.
And to Mirela in Dublin.
Hello, Nathalie, it's Anne...
Anne Laurent.
Never mind.
Can I speak to Georges?
Is he?
When will he be back?
Doesn't Jacky know either?
No, it doesn't matter.
Ask him to call me, will you?
Hello, Mrs. Becker.
Hello.
Did you write this?
No.
I didn't write anything.
Won't you read it, at least?
I don't have my glasses.
I didn't write anything.
I don't write notes like that.
Are you sure?
You would tell me, wouldn't you?
- I don't know what you want.
- Nothing.
I thought it was your writing.
I'm sorry.
So am I.
...In the distance, far off,
are lights...
...yellow lights, twinkling.
I see them through the walls.
Shapes coming toward the house.
I can't identiry them.
They want to get in.
They bang and scrape
on the walls and door.
Then the door bursts open...
I wake up...
...and try to jump up...
...but I can't move.
No sound comes out.
I implore Allah to help me.
As I'm praying,
I hear loud laughter behind me.
Then, I screamed.
Youssuf woke and turned a light on.
I was hysterical:
...there was no one there
who could've laughed.
That's when the migraines started?
When I get them...
I can't even move.
It's as if someone's driving a stake
through my head.
What did the white doctor say?
He's just a friend of Amadou's,
he gave me some pills.
"Dear Papa, I'm leaving.
Please, don't try to find me. Jean. "
...I have no idea!
It can't have been the kid.
She wouldn't sign it,
"a defenseless child". It's dumb!
A 10-year-old girI
wouldn't write that.
It's an old person's writing.
It must be the neighbor, then.
So?
So, either you believe her or not.
It's as simple as that?
Not simple, inescapable.
If you do, call the cops.
If not, forget it.
- Or ask the kid's parents.
- Ask them what?
"Do you hit your child?
Torture her ever?
"Why is she always screaming?"
Tricky, eh?
Chablis or Sancerre?
I don't give a shit!
You don't care, do you?
I do, but you got the letter.
Not me.
- I can't decide for you.
- You could fucking help!
It's too easy
just to wash your hands of it.
I never hear her crying.
I don't even know her.
I don't know her parents.
I met the old lady three times.
Not my problem!
Can you get that into your head?
It's never your problem.
When there's trouble, you're gone.
- Of course, you're right.
- Aren't I?
Why don't you grow up and stop
letting others decide for you?
And you never run away?
Eh? What about your son?
Your needle's stuck!
What are you getting at?
What if I was expecting a child?
What are you saying?
I'm pregnant.
What if I was pregnant?
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not a joke.
I aborted while you were away.
Did you?
You decide.
Is there a problem?
What is this?
Do you expect me
to take you seriously?
No, I don't.
Have you ever made someone happy?
Tell me.
Is there a single person
you have made happy?
No.
Didn't you want some rice?
...Is that setting a good example?
What's Salimata going to think?
Later on,
what will the children think?
Answer me.
- But there was a group of them.
- Nonsense!
- The teacher said...
- She can say what she wants.
You'd rather believe a white shrew
than your own son?
The mother who told the teacher
caught her son red-handed.
And the teacher said?
She raises him single-handed.
She can't cope.
I check his pockets every morning.
- I'm talking to my son.
- And I'm talking to you!
I won't be silenced
because I'm sick.
What's the teacher say?
The woman caught her son
smoking weed.
He gave 3 names,
including Demba.
And as the only black kid,
he's the guilty one.
Quiet!
He'll end up in jail, too.
Wash your mouth out!
Amadou is innocent.
Look how they all follow
his example.
He hangs out with white girls...
...instead of looking out
for his brother.
As for your daughter...
...look at her,
with her yellow crew cut!
Demba, answer me truthfully.
What have I done to you?
Be quiet!
I can't hear myself think.
Demba, I want to believe you...
...but if you lie to me...
...you'll regret it all your life!
Well?
It was François.
He took my jacket
in the school yard.
Who is François?
He's the kid whose mother
went to see the teacher.
He said he'd give my jacket back...
...if I gave him 100 francs.
I said I didn't have that much...
...but he just laughed.
He threw my jacket down...
...and trampled on it.
He said...
I was lucky he didn't ask for 200
...and if I didn't bring him
...the next day...
I wouldn't recognize my jacket.
He said I'd just have to steal
the money from home.
He still has my jacket.
Meaning?
I didn't give him the cash.
That's why he was angry...
...and fingered me.
Is that the truth?
...If you desire the spleen...
...and will laugh yourselves
into stitches, follow me.
That gull Malvolio...
...has come to court my lady...
...in yellow stockings...
...cross-gartered...
...most villainously!
I have dogged him
like his murderer.
He obeys every point of the letter.
He does smile his face...
...into more lines...
...than is in the new map
with the augmentation of the Indies.
You never saw such a thing.
I can hardly forbear
hurling things at him.
I know my lady will strike him.
If she do...
...he'll smile...
...and take it for a great favor.
Anyone out there?
...To make a new life.
When's he coming back?
I've no idea.
I miss him.
I miss him, too.
We all miss him.
He doesn't miss us.
He'll be sad all by himself.
He won't be all by himself.
There's his brother
and all his family.
He'll take a new wife
half my age.
Show some respect
for your father!
Where is he going?
If he was here...
Very far.
What would you say
if he was here?
Stop wanting
to be so strong.
He'll be traveling
a long time.
How?
First, by car.
Then, on a boat.
Then, by car again.
Will he ever come back?
Remember Uncle Ak,.
Did he come back?
Safi's still waiting...
Papa is old, you know.
It's his home.
Where?
Africa.
Where is Africa?
- When?
- 2 weeks on Monday.
Ion Fratila's wife
is driving us to Halmeu...
...near the border.
- How many of you?
- 5 so far. You'll make it 6.
Anyone from the village?
Have a think about it.
It's a good opportunity.
Don't you think, Mama?
I'll have to talk to Dragos.
Of course.
- Do you want one?
- Thanks.
I can't see Papa saying no.
I said, I'll talk to Dragos.
...Thought that he'd be married soon...
...and so he'd have a house
ready to live in.
It took us most of spring.
François lent a hand
despite him being so busy.
But no!
His lordship didn't like it.
How come François called you?
He's concerned.
Why? About me?
He should mind his own business.
He wanted to help.
That's why he's doing all this?
Because of the bulls?
He should be happy.
He'll get more for his.
He needs all he can get.
Where's Jean now?
What are you asking me for?
I have no idea.
How would I know?
I'm too busy to run after him.
In any case, he's right...
...there's no future here.
At least,
he won't have to get up at 5 a. M.
He can laze about all he likes.
What? Isn't it the truth?
Do you lot in the city
get up at 5 a. M.?
You know.
You blazed the trail for him.
Sorry, I didn't mean that.
It's okay.
The truth isn't like that.
Are you hungry?
No, thanks. Really.
Even after your drive?
Honestly, Papa, don't worry.
How are things?
Acting going well?
I'm getting on fine.
I've just shot a thriller.
You must go and see it
when it's released.
You'll have to write me
with the title when it's finished.
Prettier every day.
Far too good for you.
The way you're going,
next time I won't recognize you.
It'll be called The Collector...
Probably.
What are you going to do?
About what?
"About what"?
- About looking for Jean?
- Nothing!
It's been 6 weeks.
He should know where he belongs.
He'll come back when he wants or...
Or what?
Or...
Excuse me.
I left the pump running out there.
I feel sorry for him.
That won't help him.
What are you going to do?
...And no noise! Understand?
No speak!
If they find you, finito I'amore!
Get it?
Okay, boss. No worry.
We understand, boss.
Do business in box, okay?
Nothing dirty up there.
They smell you,
it's like they hear you!
Get it?
Yes, boss.
In Paris, wait for me to open up.
Don't get excited.
Wait till we get to depot.
Of course, boss. We wait.
Thank you.
That's all. Have a nice trip.
...Believe that little Francoise...
...has already entered Your kingdom.
In Your goodness, grant us...
...that we might one day share with her...
...in eternal life.
Through Jesus Christ, Amen.
...The second day,
on the road from Ghurian to Herat.
They separated us.
I was left in a totally dark room.
A Taliban fighter
appeared every 2 hours...
...silhouetted in the doorway,
pointing at me.
"You French," he'd say...
...before miming cutting his throat.
Absolutely charming.
After 2 days, the guy was replaced.
A new guard turned up.
He had a flashlight...
...and asked in perfect English...
I felt so relieved.
I told him my story:
...photographer,
big misunderstanding, etc...
He listened and said...
I thought he seemed reassuring,
so I told it again...
...slowly and more clearly.
First time round,
I'd garbled half of it.
When I'd finished,
he looked at me and said...
It was all he could say...
...but he didn't even know
what it meant.
In the end, Phil got us out...
...by using his contacts at CNN.
You can mention it to Francine.
It'll make her laugh.
In my cell,
I thought about what she said.
Don't tell her,
she'll be even more unbearable.
It's easy to talk about
"ecology of the image"
...and "value
of the non-transmitted message".
What matters is the end result.
I guess she finds it all
too bothersome.
After all, she could be right.
How would knowing help her?
I don't think
I'm fit for life in peace.
What you call "peace" at least.
waiting for something to happen.
People are polite but wary.
I can hardly blame them...
...Excellent!
Did your husband make it?
Yes.
You can tell.
It's nothing like that gutrot.
Here, son.
Where's Lenutza?
Lenutza left 2 weeks ago...
...to meet her sister in Italy
and work picking grapes.
She went with a big group.
Who has her card?
I've no idea.
Who has Lenutza's card?
What?
Who bought Lenutza's yellow card?
That new girl from Aliceni maybe.
Mirela.
That's right. Mirela...
A few days before Lenutza left,
One of them bought her card.
What are you so upset about?
- Are you homesick?
- No!
I wanted to sell newspapers.
What do you mean?
Before I left, I called Lenutza.
She promised me
her license to sell papers.
She wanted to go home.
Can't you just apply?
I was deported a few months ago.
You'll find something.
Of course...
Sure I will.
One day, in Certeze...
I gave some money
to a gypsy beggar.
She was so dirty,
I ran to wash my hands...
...to avoid catching a disease.
She simply disgusted me.
So?
Last winter...
...on Boulevard St. Germain...
...a well-dressed man
was about to give me 20 francs...
But when he saw
...my outstretched hand...
...he threw the bill into my lap
as if I nauseated him.
I rushed back here
and hid myself in the attic.
I cried my eyes out all day.
It was so embarrassing.
Do you see?
You can't take it.
You don't measure up.
- Say what?
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
- But I really love you.
- Really truly?
- Really truly.
True true?
True true.
Pierrot!
Don't move!
Wait! Don't move.
What do you think you were doing?
Can't you see it's dangerous?
But there's a balloon!
If you do that again,
you'll get your first ever smack!
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Dad.
I feel sick.
Get out of here.
I can't let you out of my sight.
We have to move.
What?
I can't live on the 20th floor...
...always worrying he'll fall.
Let's stop there.
And start where?
From the top, of course.
Really?
Just winding you up.
No, the shot after all the gurgling...
when you say:
"I love you, too... "
Why bother? It was fine.
Except for the plane.
What plane?
You can hear a plane fly over.
Okay, kids, let's do it!
I love you, too.
Sorry. Let's try again.
Okay, here we go!
I love you, too.
Okay, calm down.
Can we just calm down?
We've lots to get through.
I'm sorry.
Down to business.
Recess is now ended.
Let's try to act grown up
and get some work done.
Is it so hard to tell him
"I love you"?
No, not really.
Thank you.
Here, for you.
Thank you.
Beautiful car, sir.
Excuse me...
...aren't you a top model?
Honestly, with your looks...
...you just have to be in that line.
I'm in the biz, too.
Wouldn't guess, eh?
You wouldn't, would you?
I was at the gym.
So, miss...
Don't talk to commoners?
Didn't offend you, did I?
I wonder
if you're one of these rich...
...beautiful people from high society.
No?
A shy little typist, then?
Waiting for Prince Charming
to race up in his Ferrari.
Is that it?
I don't get it.
How can you be so beautiful
yet so arrogant?
That's not very nice!
What am I going to do by myself...
...in the big, bad city?
Tell me that.
What do you say?
Isn't that a cheap trick?
Maybe I'm not good enough for her.
For the lady to be in the subway
with the tramps...
...there must be a reason.
It's the chauffeur's day off.
Yeah, that must be it.
What about you, ma'am?
What do you think?
Nothing? Is that so?
Shame! She doesn't think.
Now what will you do?
Stand me up again?
Hop off into the next car?
It's too easy...
Why? Do I smell?
Is that it?
I'm just a little Arab
looking for a little affection.
Like everyone else.
Nothing doing?
Never mind.
You crazy jerk!
Who's a jerk?
Shame on you!
I'll see you around.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
