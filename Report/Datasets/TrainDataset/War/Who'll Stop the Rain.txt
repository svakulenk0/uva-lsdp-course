'Hello Phantom 6, this is Skywatch 2.
'We've got 30 to 40 Victor Charlies in open,
'Be aware Red Lake Fire Base.
Danger. Close target
'Roger, I have yellow smoke in sight
'This is Skywatch. Come on in.
Save your steel, we'll use softies on this
'Roger
'Phantom, watch your direction.
You're a little close.
'You're too close. Abort mission
'Too late, I've released
'Fire Base, it's gonna get
mighty hot down there
- Hit it!
-
incoming! Incoming!
'Dear Marge,
'I'm coming home.
'You said when I left
that people were dying
'and that I was crapping around
with fate to come here.
'You were more right than you could imagine.
'Let me tell you the latest.
'Military Command has decided
that elephants are enemy agents
'because they cary supplies for the Vietcong.
'So now we're stampeding the elephants
and gunning them down from the air.
'Of course, I filed a suitably
outraged story about it
'but that was my last one.
'l have no more cheap morals
to draw from all this death.
'So I've taken action.
'An old friend from my Marine days
will be coming to see you soon.
'His name is Ray Hicks. We owe him $1,OOO.
'l want you to pay him.
'I've started something here that I can't stop
'and it's the right thing, I know.
'You see, in a world
where elephants are pursued by flying men,
'people are just naturally
going to want to get high.
'I'll explain when I see you
and you'll understand
Charmian?
-  Hello, Johnny.
- Hi, Charmian.
-  Did the man deliver?
- He surely did. You just missed him.
I kinda wanted you to meet him.
He's an impressive little fella.
Take off those muddy boots, will you?
When you see guys like that,
you know it's all worthwhile.
Colonel Tho used to be
a very gung ho soldier.
He says it's us came over here
and corrupted him.
He thinks we made him deal smack?
People can be corrupted, John.
Are you high?
Just a little boo with mon colonel.
You wanna ty it?
lt's a weird time to get high.
Why? Are you scared?
Yep.
You're the world's most frightened man.
I don't know how you live with yourself.
I sometimes think that myself.
How's this for terrifying?
-You wanna count it?
- I trust you.
My friends are gonna have
$25,OOO waiting for you.
That's a nice return on a small investment.
- Did you weigh it?
- I don't have to. It's 2kg.
You don't get burned with heroin
by getting short weight. They cut it.
They're not gonna burn me,
Johnny, believe me.
Don't think about it.
You're doing the right thing.
Yes, I am.
How about your old lady in Berkeley?
We don't have to talk about that. It's all set.
But, you see, we don't know her.
Maybe there's a side to her
that even you don't know about.
ln all modesty, there isn't.
All right, it's your dope.
Yeah.
How much are your friends
gonna make out of this?
I don't know, maybe a few hundred thousand.
Depends on how they cut it.
I don't want the trouble.
Who are they?
Not the sort of people you might think.
You used to have some
funny friends in Washington.
People keep in touch.
What are you gonna do with your money?
Such a dedicated non-swinger as you are.
I don't know.
Shit, you don't know, do you?
You just know you want it.
I desire to serve God
and to grow rich, like all men.
Who said that?
Oh, I don't know. Some great hustler of the past.
Let's see your Brownie.
Where are you from in the world?
California.
You're going the right way if you want pictures.
Charlie's got skin diving sapper girls.
They swim out from the beaches
with charges in their teeth,
stick 'em on the hulls of those big AKs and wham!
How'd you like a picture of that?
Get out of there, you little fuckers.
Know what I think about?
I think about catching myself
a little sapper girl and fucking her to death.
I'm a vicious freak.
You know what else they got?
Porpoises trained to kill gooks.
This is a very strange war.
Yeah, it's weird, man.
We're not supposed to talk about it.
- Be right back.
-
- Holy Christ! You made it.
- Sure I did.
When I talked to you the other night,
I thought you were drunk.
I was.
How did you get in the base?
I'm doing a story on merchant seamen.
Sure you are. We'll go get a beer.
- Hey, I've got something for you.
- No shit.
- Sappers?
- There ain't no sappers.
That's all a beautiful hoax.
You remember Macklin from Pendleton?
- The CO?
-Yeah.
Sure, I remember him.
I saw him last month in Oakland.
Told him you're a big time reporter now.
How do you get along with
the Marines down here?
Fine. We get along fine.
- Don't they want you to re-up?
- Not these guys. Not for this one.
You're still into this?
Yeah.
Jesus, that's really fucking piquant.
I don't know what the hell that means.
You turned me onto that book.
Yeah. I used to do stuff like that.
It's a good book.
You look terrible. You look like hell.
ls that for me?
That's the sorriest piece of packaging
I've ever seen. What's in there?
lt's two keys of scag.
Do you know what you're saying?
I didn't think we were that way.
We're that way.
-We did talk about this.
- I thought it'd be something else.
-You said you wanted to carry weight.
- I cary grass, not that shit.
If your stash is as good as you say,
it'll be easier than carrying grass.
I'll give you a thousand now,
my wife has another thousand for you.
-You deliver and you split. It's that simple.
- It's bad karma.
Look, I believe that
this operation concerns Washington.
Not Washington,
I mean certain individuals.
They know about you.
They checked you out.
What the hell are you tying to do to me?
They absolutely won't bother you.
They won't fuck with you if you deliver.
lf I deliver, right?
But if I don't deliver
if I take you off because I happen to know
you're an asshole, then the roof falls in.
- Ray...
- If I wanted to keep a carrier honest,
I might make up a bullshit story
about Washington
but I would never lay it on a friend - it sucks.
You can't say no, Ray.
You're really scared, aren't you?
- I'm impressed.
- I'm a very timid person. I'm paranoid.
lf this weren't stone-cool,
I wouldn't go near it.
You can cary it, you know I can't.
Your ship sails tomorrow.
OK, I'll carry your scag, John.
Hell, why not?
Little adrenaline cleans the blood.
But make sure I get treated right.
Self-defence is an art I cultivate.
Thanks.
Why are you doing this?
I don't know, l...
I feel that this is the first real thing
I've ever done in my life.
I don't know what
the other stuff was about.
Don't they say that this is where
everybody finds out who they are? Huh?
Yeah. What a bummer for the gooks.
Five,
SeVen,
I
four
five, five.
-We'll take two dozen.
-
- Edna, would you take care of Tony?
- Sure.
Bender Books. Can I help you?
-  'Let me talk to Marge
- This is Marge.
- This is Ray.
- 'Who?'
- Ray Hicks.
- Can you hold on a minute?
I want to take this in the office.
- Is that a personal call?
- No. Stay there. Hello?
-  'I'm here
-You're a friend of John's, right?
'You got somebody with you, Marge?'
Um, my father's here. Have you seen John?
I'll fall by your place tomorrow.
Evening OK?
- 'What do you mean?'
- Tomorrow, your place.
Are you going to be ready for me?
ls John all right?
'He's fine. Are you
going to be ready for me?'
Oh!
Yeah. Sure.
You mean the money he owes you?
- 'What time?'
- Tomorrow night. Nine.
Yeah.
ls something wrong with John?
No, he's fine.
He's coming home in a few days.
- Marge.
- Mm-hm?
Was that a friend of John's?
I guess so.
I feel kind of deranged.
-What are you doing?
- I'm taking a pill. A pill.
-You said you were going to stop.
- Seems to be a problem of motivation.
- Good night, Edna.
- Marge, just a minute.
I got this for Janey.
I thought it was so cute.
- It's got a lot of candy in it.
- I'll send you the dental bill.
- No, she'll like it, she really will.
- Give her a kiss for me.
Why didn't you tell me
John was coming back?
I'm just not up for more talks about
his character, his future or his attitude.
OK, OK, OK.
How about bringing Janey
down for the weekend?
Yeah. That'd be nice.
Janey, how would you like to spend
the weekend with your grandpa?
- I can't.
- Oh, yeah? Why not?
I want to go to Edna's.
-You can't go to Edna's evey time...
-
That's our phone!
Can I have this?
Because they threw it away.
Sure.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mrs Converse.
Oh. Well, let me write that down. Hold on.
Can we buy a little fish?
- Can we buy a little fish?
-Just a minute, honey.
Uh-huh. I got that. OK, thank you.
- Can we buy a little fish?
-Yeah. Sure.
- Guess what?
-What? Tell me what.
Daddy's coming home early.
# Hey! #
Hi. Another one, please.
# Everybody's gettin' high
# You'd better take it easy cos the place is on fire
# Been a hard day, nothing went too good
# Now I'm gonna relax,
honey, everybody should... #
Did you have a good trip?
Yeah. Pretty good.
They still got a lot of good pussy over there?
Yeah.
When do you go back?
I'm going to put some bread by
and go down to Mexico.
-  Hey, Alex.
- Mexico? That's a good place.
# ..gonna gimme some lovin'
# Whoo-hoo
# Gonna gimme some lovin' #
# Gonna be tonight
# Don't you know I'm flyin'
# Tonight... #
-What a lot of shit this place is now.
-# Tonight... #
What the hell happened to pool tables?
-You got to change with the times.
- The times are fucked.
I don't want to look at these poor junkies.
I'd just as soon look at you.
- I ain't got no costume.
-You got bigger tits.
# Watch me now
# Jody's gonna get religion all night long
# Hey, come on
# Gonna hear the sun... #
- Hey, Alex.
-# Tonight
# Tonight... #
Kid over by the wall. You know him?
No.
- Is he a new face?
-We got nothing but new faces here.
When did you say you were going to Mexico?
I didn't say I was going to Mexico.
Yes, you did. You said you were going.
That's a dream.
# Gonna get it to the rafters
# Watch me... #
Johnny.
Johnny.
- He's going to deliver.
- Man, I wouldn't have.
Way to go, Raymond. Way to go.
Very cute.
What's going on?
Back door action.
- Don't be afraid.
-What do you want? Who are you?
I'm Ray Hicks.
I'm the guy that phoned you.
Why did you come in that way?
I don't understand.
Somebody's been on my ass all day.
-What are you doing?
- I don't know whether I lost them or not.
- Do you understand?
- Uh...
You're John's friend. The one who phoned?
That's right. I'll take my money and run.
- Oh, l...l don't have it.
-Why not?
I mean I don't have it here.
Today's been kind of difficult.
You said you'd be ready.
I know, but I had to take my little girl
to the aquarium and the bank was closed.
You dumb cooze. What are you, a junkie?
- Do I look like a junkie?
- That's not always a factor.
-John will be home tomorrow.
-What is this shit?
You said you'd be ready.
You didn't say John was coming home early.
What are you tying to do? Fuck me over?
You and some people?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Listen to me.
lf I beat up on you and I took your smack,
I'd be within my rights.
You can't treat people
in this outrageous fucking manner.
I don't have any smack.
I don't know who you are.
if you want money,
I'll give you the cash I've got.
Your old man's got shit for brains.
- Do you have a place to stash this?
-What is it?
That's smack. Two keys.
It's never been cut.
I'm carrying it for John.
That's why you owe me money.
What am I supposed to do with it?
I work in a bookstore, for Christ's sake.
You're supposed to hold on to it.
Your Johnny's made some new friends.
-You're a couple of marks, you and John.
-What do you mean, marks?
- People are gonna see that right away.
-What people?
I don't know who you're talking about.
-You will.
- Oh, he's really in bad shape.
You know, he can't even roll a joint.
I mean, he never cared about money.
He must have just flipped out over there.
He's not the only one.
Look, I don't know if he told you or not
but we do have a child.
Now, can't you just
take it somewhere else?
No, Marge, I can't take it somewhere else.
How long's he gonna be in there?
I think he's dicking her, that's what I think.
I'm going outside for a minute.
I've got a bottle in the car. I'll be right back.
Oh, look, look, look.
What's he going inside for?
I think he made us.
Come on. Get the back door.
Shit.
-What's going on?
- Company.
- Go in the back with your kid.
-What?
Do what I say! Whatever happens,
don't answer that front door.
- Mommy!
- It's all right.
What's going on?
-
-  Come on, get the door open.
- Come on, you...
-What the fuck is going on?
- I'll kill you quick.
- OK, OK, OK.
Hey, man! OK.
Don't move.
Shhh. Shhh.
Give me that hand. Give me!
Keep down.
-Just stay in bed.
-
Raymond.
Raymond, this isn't about you, man.
-You weren't supposed to be involved.
- Shut up.
-You ever seen these guys before?
- No. Who are they?
Mommy!
They're take-off artists, that's who.
Mommy!
Mommy!
- Mommy, don't go away.
- Shh!
Don't leave me alone in here.
Raymond.
Raymond, listen to me.
There's no deal, it's just us.
- Get up!
-You were just supposed to make the drop.
-We got no problem with you.
-
Raymond, will you listen?
Marge, come in here.
- Shh. Shh...
-  Marge!
Marge!
-
- Get in here!
Shit, this is theft.
You're gonna pay for this.
Fucking A, you're gonna pay!
He's gonna burn!
Don't involve yourself in a disaster.
It's just her and her husband - a couple of idiots.
Get his keys, in the bedroom.
Hicks, what are you getting from this run?
A couple of grand?
I'll double it, for Christ's sake.
I'm doing a favour for a buddy.
How you gonna double that?
Give me those keys.
- Maybe I oughtta kill you fellas.
- It wouldn't help.
I might feel better.
You'll end up in a bag, you know that?
Mommy!
Pick up that gun. Pick up that gun!
You're in big trouble if you touch that gun.
It's 30 years. We're federal agents.
-Are they?
- No, they're people John was expecting.
- Give me that.
- Lady, you are gonna regret this. I swear it.
- Give it to them.
- They'd kill us anyway.
That's an intelligent young lady.
You hear what she says, man.
- I'm calling the cops!
- Listen, you call the cops,
they'll nail you, they'll nail John,
they'll take your kid away - it's your dope.
Grab anything that says where you're going.
Pack some stuff for yourself and the kid.
I'll be back in a minute.
'Wild Turkey, come in please.
What's going on, Wild Turkey? What..
- Is she OK?
- I don't know. She's exhausted.
You got someplace you can leave her?
Someplace safe?
I'm not leaving her anywhere.
Do you think those guys
are going to forget about you?
Evey bum in the state
is gonna be looking for that smack.
Jesus...
Come on, Marge.
Maybe we can get clear
but not with your kid along.
I can't leave her.
You saw those guys.
They'll kill her if they have to.
You want her to have a better chance
than we got, you leave her someplace safe.
Edna?
- Honey, what is it?
- I need help.
Come in.
- I thought...
- Come on, get in.
-Where are we going?
- I know what you thought.
-Are you gonna tell me where we're going?
- I've got a place in LA.
We'll be there in eight hours.
# Long as I remember
# Rain been coming down
# Clouds of mystery pouring
# Confusion on the ground
# Good men through the ages
# Tying to find the sun
# And I wonder, still I wonder
# Who'll stop the rain
# I went down Virginia
# Seeking shelter from the storm
# Caught up in the fable
# I watched the tower grow... #
We should warn John.
- Shouldn't we?
-What are you gonna tell him?
''Go back to Saigon''?
# Still I wonder
# Who'll stop the rain... #
# Proud May keep on burning
# Rolling
# Rolling
# Rolling on the river... #
# Put a little love in your heart... #
'That's $am. Rock in Los Angeles
to the beat of KFRH. We'll be back..
Stay here.
Ray.
What happened?
Neighbourhood freaks.
Could've been a body in this bag.
The big ones eat
the little ones up here.
Come on. Welcome to LA.
Really good to see you.
Marge!
- Is Janey all right?
- I talked to Edna.
Yeah?
Your father's sending Janey
to his brother's place in Canada.
Well, she's been there before.
She loves it there.
It's a farm, you know?
- It's perFect. You did the right thing.
-
- They came this morning with Janey.
-Where are they now?
Marge is hiding God knows where,
Janey's in Canada.
What's she doing in Canada?
I sent her there because
her parents are criminals.
She's with Arthur.
Why the hell are you dealing heroin?
Have you lost your mind?
Maybe. How much do you know?
There was a man here this morning
named Antheil, a federal agent.
He asked me if I knew my daughter
was caught up in a narcotics ring.
- They're already after us.
- They've got you.
I've been waiting all my life to fuck up like this.
-You finally made the big time.
- I can't believe we did this.
A sense of unreality is not a legal defence.
lf Marge is safe, she'll call.
-Where are you going?
- Home. It's all I can do.
- No.
-What the fuck am I supposed to do?
Run. Don't ty any heroics.
They haven't heard from John, have they?
Oh, God.
Can you imagine what
Janey's going through?
- I was a kid once. I had days like that.
- Not like that.
Wait till I tell you the story of my life.
You'll eat your heart out.
How'd you turn out?
Your husband once told somebody
I was a psychopath.
That's the kind of thing he'd say.
-You think he could be right?
- It's a very imprecise term.
Hey, bubby.
Hey.
Come on, get him in the car.
I shot a guy in the gut one time in Nam.
It don't kill you.
lf l'd been there by myself,
I'd have given it to them.
That's what we should have done -
just given it to them.
- It isn't yours any more.
-Whose is it?
lt belongs to whoever controls it.
So is it yours now?
if you wanted to rip it off,
you should've done it before.
You never should've shown up with it.
I can see where you could be
a real pain in the ass.
Would you like me to go home?
I'd love to do that, but I can't.
Come on, Marge,
you and John fucked up.
Don't give me your regrets.
You think I want that shit?
I never moved that stuff in my life.
Wait a minute.
Maybe we can sell it to them after all.
Ty it again.
They offered you a deal.
We could still make one.
-
- Shut it off.
We could still make a deal!
Who's we? They know what
fuck-ups we are. They've got their pride.
- I don't think we could pull it off.
- I think they're fuck-ups, too.
- They're animals. You can't deal with animals.
-Why don't we just leave it?
Buy it and just...
All my life I've been taking shit
from inferior people. No more!
Fuck 'em!
When I left the Marines,
I made myself a promise -
never again am I gonna be
fucked around by morons.
The next mother that tries to make me back off
is gonna have to live it out with me.
You're not playing this right.
You gotta identify with your captors,
like those guys in Korea.
-What did he say?
- He said, ''Where is what?''
- That's right. OK.
-
OK, John. Come on. Up you get. That's a boy.
Here you go. You're gonna love this.
What's it say?
ln danger, all that counts is going forward.
What else?
''By growing used to danger,
man can allow it to become part of him.
''He grows used to evil'
ls that what happened to John?
Are we gonna talk about him?
When you knew Johnny in the Marines,
what was he like?
ln some ways he was beautiful.
ln some ways he had his head up his ass.
Like this number here.
Drink with me.
-Why did you cary for him?
- Because he asked me.
I don't always have to have
a reason for the shit I do.
-Why are you taking this?
- Pain.
Bullshit. You got a habit, Marge. How much?
I don't know...
I guess I'm doing too much.
lt's my last one.
-Are we gonna stay here?
- No.
We're gonna ty and move that stuff.
Where is she?
Where is she, bubby?
I don't know. I swear.
Hey, I've seen your old lady doll. She's big.
Big? She's not big.
-
- Let me tell you how it is, John.
I was humiliated in front of your wife.
Your friend Raymond chained me to a toilet.
The bastard thought it was funny.
You know, your old lady's
fucking that guy right now.
Moaning and groaning on the floor,
on the bed, upside down, sideways.
What's this for? You making pasta?
You could scald yourself, schmuck.
Pour it out. We'll do what I said, huh?
Leave the heat on.
Let me tell you about your pal.
He looked at me and there
was this little twinkle in his eye,
like he's thinking,
''What a schmuck this Jules is.
''What a contemptible fucking idiot'
And she helped him do it, man.
I hated it!
-Where is she?
- I don't know.
No? No? You sure you're not lying, John?
Lying to protect her ass, man?
You sure you're not lying?
Hicks and your old lady,
they don't give two shits about you.
They're out there having
a great time together.
Yeah, probably still laughing about
how they tied the schmuck to a toilet.
-Again.
-
Hold it.
Yeah?
No, no, there's nothing.
OK.
Hey, bubby, you can go home now.
Hi.
My name's Antheil, narcotics investigation.
I was just reading your play.
Found it on the shelf over there.
I like a lot of it.
Don't like the main character, though,
this Marine, he sounds a little jellyfish.
I guess you're supposed to like him
because he's against the Marine Corps?
- Something like that.
-Why doesn't he do something?
I mean, go over the hill,
refuse an order? I don't know.
I couldn't sympathise with a character like that.
Not everyone did.
The Marine in the play,
is that supposed to be you?
No.
- Maybe a little?
- Maybe on some level.
Uh-huh.
You know what I think, on some level?
I think you're a cocksucker
who writes a tear-jerk play
and then smuggles in a shitload of heroin.
I deny that. No more
literary conversation until I call my lawyer.
You mean Ben O'Dell?
No commie lawyer is gonna help you now.
-What do you want from me?
-A little help.
John, did you think about who
you were cutting in on, running scag?
- I don't know what you mean.
- The bikers, the black guys in Oakland.
The Syndicate. I mean, that's nothing.
They've got a lot of imagination
when they deal with clowns like you.
- I've heard the stories.
- They're all true.
I can feed them your ass.
I'll just let you run loose. You'll be picked off
the street in less than 24 hours.
You know the only one
who can help you?
- Me.
-
# Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
# My hands were clenched in fists of rage
# No angel born in hell
# Could break that Satan's spell
# And as the flames climbed high into the night
# To light the sacrificial rite
# I saw Satan laughing with delight
# The day... #
Hi, Eddie.
What are you saying? What do you need?
I fell into something.
I thought l'd look you up.
Yeah? Good for you.
Can we talk? I got something for you.
# This'll be the day that I die... #
Ray, you fucker!
How come I didn't know you, man?
lt's been some time.
I want to move some scag.
You know what I mean?
I don't see any problems.
What's life without a dream, Raymond?
No.
Just run the name Ray Hicks
through the computer
and give me evemhing that comes up.
No, forget that one,
I want the APB on the Land Rover.
There can't be more than 20 of them registered.
lt's easy to spot, it's a very distinctive vehicle.
I don't know. Ty Washington.
Right. Let me know.
-Who are those guys?
-Witnesses. Helping me in the investigation.
Tell me about your charming wife.
She's 30 years old,
she's half-lrish and half-Jewish.
Don't get smart,
I want to know how to deal with her.
ls she likely to burn her husband
and split with a boyfriend?
Or the victim of circumstance?
if you want to know,
I think she's pretty moral, basically.
Pretty moral, basically?
Oh, Jesus. What a couple of yo-yos.
You're in a lot of trouble, my friend.
So's your crazy old lady.
if you help us, maybe I can let you walk.
Both of you.
-You want me to help?
- That's right.
-What if I refuse?
- If you refuse?
Well, there's always your little girl.
What is it? Janey?
What do you want me to do?
I'll let you know.
Our little friend in Saigon
told me you were nuts.
- She didn't tell me the half of it.
- Friend?
Charmian. We go back a long way.
Even a dipstick like you
should have figured that out.
I'll let you know, John.
I'll sell you a key for 20.
I'll give you a rate for two.
This comes as a complete surprise to me.
Not the sort of thing
I'd have expected from you.
But that's the fucking war for you.
You're going to approach
a group of responsible people.
You want to sell scag to the film industry?
A dealer with a clientele like that?
It's perFect for him.
Jesus, Ray. You're here
in the big town with all that shit.
Doesn't it make your heart go pitty-pat?
I'd be scared, man.
-Am I talking to the right person, Eddie?
-Am I God, Ray? How would I know?
Look at those kids. ''l want it, I want it'
I should steal for evey creep in town.
''Do this, do that, Eddie.
''I'm sitting on top of all this shit, Eddie.
Please lay it off for me'
- If you want to, say yes. If not, say no.
-All right.
I got some ideas in this.
I've been associated with this guy.
He's English, he used to be a masseur.
He has a lot of goofs he works.
He knows what everybody likes.
He might be the one.
No intrigues, Eddie.
Paranoia, Raymond.
Whatever.
I'll put you in touch.
- How about tonight?
- Tonight?
Man, you must be desperate.
How's your friend?
lf I was smart, I wouldn't even know him.
Are we scared?
We don't know the meaning of scared.
Did you eat anything?
You want to call your kid?
They can't trace one phone call.
Sure.
I'll call her and say,
''Hi, honey, this is your mommy.
''She loves you very much
but she has to go bye-bye'
I know all about that call.
I can handle the rest of it.
lt's just what's in my head
and it's so gruesome.
OK. We're going to get you high.
- Don't joke with me.
- I'm not joking. Come on.
I don't know much about
that stuff you're taking,
so I don't know what your tolerance is.
You snort it like coke.
Let's see if you can get off.
Go ahead and hit the other one.
All right, all right. OK, come on.
- Better than a week in the county, right?
- Hmm.
lt's a lot better
than a week in the county.
Oh...
Oh, it's good.
Oh, right in the head.
Ah, jeez.
lt does funny little things to you.
Do you remember last night?
Mmm.
I remember evemhing
with absolute clarity
since you walked in on me.
Not one funny little thing slips by me.
Do you believe me?
What can I do? I got to believe you.
Ahh...
You know, I was really strung out there.
Don't brag about it,
it's not such a tough condition.
This isn't what you want, not really.
Maybe it is.
lt's simpler than life.
I'll call Eddie.
Whatever's right.
Check and mate.
Where the fuck did that come from?
I didn't even see that!
You got me.
You stupid little bastard!
You better learn how to play the game.
-You hit my fucking bridge, man.
- Tough tit!
Why don't you read a goddamn chess book?
I hate jailbird chess, I hate the style!
Like a goddamn little tweety bird,
''Oh, here's a move' It's fucking degrading.
Plenty of guys will belt you when they lose.
Fucking Danskin, he wins and he hits you.
Where do you think I learned how to play?
I learned it in the slammer, man!
I can't help that!
-
-
Hello there.
You brought your samples with you?
Did you make your contact?
Who are you? A schoolteacher?
lt's the big dealer!
And the woman of mystery!
Well, come on in and say hello.
Oh!
Who the hell are you, Raymond? Buffalo Bill?
You're going to love this guy.
- Is that the Englishman?
- Patience.
Our hosts are the nicest folks
you'd ever want to meet.
Gerald and Jody, this is Raymond and, er...
- Marge.
- Marge.
Hello.
Sit down.
ls that the Englishman?
Gerald is a writer.
And a hell of a writer at that.
Gerald, explain yourself to the man.
This may not be easy.
I've been fooling around
with a project that concerns drugs.
I've done dope like a lot of people have
and I've had some beautiful things on acid.
Excuse me.
I want a word with your friend.
-Wait for me.
- It's all right.
Oh, please. Come, sit down.
Would you like some Chablis?
-What is this shit?
- He wants to cop, I thought you'd be amused.
- I don't want this insanity.
- Then you're stupid.
What you got to sell is a no-no here.
For 6,OOO, I'll take it off your hands.
But you can screw Gerald for a lot more.
-You'll give me what?
- The guy's loaded, his wife's an heiress.
-You said 6,OOO?
- Take it easy.
I'll burn it before I take a fucking like this.
You'll take a fucking like you wouldn't believe.
-You're doing me, Eddie.
- Hands off.
Get your hands off me, cocksucker!
You nickel-and-dime asshole.
Don't you dare threaten me with violence.
You're way out of your league here, Jack.
You're not selling grass
to college girls down here.
I'm doing you a favour.
-You're too vain, Eddie.
-You think so?
I can lay this off for you.
Ain't nobody else can.
You don't have the bread.
Yes, I do.
When we're finished here,
we'll take a little ride, do a little business.
Finish what?
We're going to turn Gerald on.
Then he's gonna do us a few favours
because we're gonna make him scared.
We're gonna put you into his life. He's gonna
want evemhing back the way it was before.
You like it?
Yeah, I like it, Eddie.
Now this is what I call
narcotics paraphernalia, Eddie.
I got better than that, sweetheart.
I got some coke to run with it.
Ed's my absolute picture of the operator.
Mine, too.
Raymond's the operator, not me.
- Is Ed an addict, Gerald?
- I don't know.
- I didn't know he was an addict.
-Yeah, Ed's an addict.
-Ain't you, Ed?
- None of your fucking business.
Shit, man.
Ah, shit... Ay, ay, ay, Chihuahua!
- Is it Mexican?
-  Is it Mexican?
She wants to know if it's Mexican.
-Who's next?
-What about me?
lt's got to be you.
- Unless you'd like to go first, Gerald.
- There's no reason you shouldn't.
Now, you give me someplace nice.
Gerald, I'm gonna take her pants off.
- Does he know what he's doing?
- Mm-hm.
Bend down. That's real pretty.
Be careful.
- Ow!
-  That's a pretty girl.
Ow!
- Does that feel good?
- No, it doesn't... That's enough!
Eddie, stop it!
Raymond, you got to do the rest now.
I gotta goof.
OK.
- Should I take my pants down?
-You don't have to. Sit down.
Don't hit him in a vein, Raymond.
Eddie, I'm not going to hit him
in a vein, man.
Don't look.
Oh, my God.
-Ah! Eddie! Help! My God!
- Eddie, it's a vein!
Raymond! Come on, Ray.
What are you doing, man?
We talked about the vein.
Hustling little creep,
Iet me see you hustle now.
-What are you doing?
-Why did you do it?
Too vain, Eddie. You're too vain to take a joke!
Oh, God, Ray.
-We're getting out.
-We've got to help them!
- Let's get out of here.
- Gerald, get up!
Help me! Gerald, get up.
Get up, Gerald, and walk, man! Get up, Gerald!
I want out of this fucking city!
Were you tying to kill him? He's just
a jerk with a dumb idea, the same as us!
Eddie knows what to do.
He'll pull them through.
-Why Gerald?
- Because he's a Martian!
They're all Martians!
And I'm a loyal American that fought for my flag.
Peace was fucking with me
and I don't take shit from Martians.
ln Vietnam, I had men that were dead
the day they hit that place.
ln the morning they were in Hawaii,
in the afternoon they were dead.
- So fuck Gerald?
- That's right, fuck Gerald.
I was pissed off, it seemed like a good idea.
Where are we going?
South.
'Now, for my first deal today,
I am going to give you..
''
'I'm going to give you a place -
you can take all the salad out of there!
'No, I'm not going to do that. Is it real? Great!
'I'll have that during the commercials..
Turn that shit off.
- 'Would you like that?'
-  'l'd love it
'He's brought this case..
- How do you guys know each other?
-Antheil introduced us.
-Antheil's quite a fellow.
- He's the coolest.
Fucking guy's got bread stashed away,
beautiful home, chicks coming and going.
Who says the system don't work?
Don't tell that to Antheil.
Does he pay you?
You think I do this for nothing?
I get a crack at a job with the agency after this.
- Don't you have a record?
- Don't mean shit.
Antheil says you're in, you're in.
I could really go for that.
You could be a second Antheil, right?
-Yeah.
- ''
What about Danskin?
Does he want to work for the agency, too?
He's a brute, man. A psycho.
A dude like that, he can't deal with the public.
lt's me.
Right.
OK.
We're moving out.
They spotted the boyfriend's car in LA.
Know who's with him? Your bigger half.
# Long as I remember
# Rain been coming down
# Clouds of mystery pouring
# Confusion on the ground
# Good men through the ages... #
- Thank you.
-# Tying to find the sun
# And I wonder, still I wonder
# Who'll stop the rain... #
Get me the map,
I want to take some back roads.
Jesus, home on the range.
We just missed Yuma.
That's California.
Arizona, New Mexico.
-Are you talking about the border?
- No, we're going to the mountain.
El Ojo Grande, The Big Eye.
# ...l watched the tower grow
# Five-year plans and new deals
# Wrapped in golden chains... #
What do we do now?
Go after them, what else?
You're going on the road. We located your wife,
I'm arranging a touching reunion.
I just had a very interesting talk
with an old buddy of Ray Hicks'.
Tell me, how do you feel about
your wife and Hicks?
- How do I feel about them?
-Yeah.
I feel left out.
What the fuck is this?
We're going to New Mexico.
That's right.
The land of enchantment.
When we go in,
you're gonna help us negotiate.
- Negotiate?
- Maybe we'll exchange you for the dope.
We'll improvise.
Psychodrama. You get to be the star.
I knew I wasn't looking at it right.
I was considering all the legal issues here.
You let me worry about that.
I'm very good in court.
You ready to go, fellas?
Wait. We're going to be
out in the back of beyond.
- How are we going to contact you?
- I'll be waiting for you.
I have a colleague there.
We've done business before.
He'll tell me when Hicks arrives.
# Gonna be tonight
# Don't you know I'm flyin'...
# ..tonight
# Hey, come on
# Gonna chase tomorrow
# Tonight
# Tonight... #
-Antheil. They arrived.
-
Hup, hup, hup!
What is this?
What did you have here?
Iron huts.
Hoedowns, celebrations,
light shows, tribal dances.
Sounds like fun.
No doubt about it.
Dieter!
Dieter...Dieter...
I've come home!
This is Dieter Pravda's place.
He's the man we need right now.
lf anybody can lay that stuff off, he can.
Come on, let's start walking.
The house is way up there on top.
Here, give me your hand.
I don't know if he's up there,
but he's never gone for long.
Anyway, Dieter doesn't care.
We can stay there forever if we want to, babe.
The Jesuits built it
in the missionary days.
They came up here
when they were hassled.
lt's kind of a retreat.
Dieter's had it for about ten years.
-  Jesus!
-Yeah.
Hey, beautiful.
Come on out here a minute and talk to me.
You know what?
I put this whole system in myself.
-Yeah?
- See those wires?
They run all the way down the mountain.
You can run all that stuff in the valley from here.
You know, when I came up here in '65,
there were all kinds of people here.
Dieter hauled in a couple of tons of hardware.
He had speakers, amplifiers,
tape decks, microphones, all kinds of lights.
Came in and said we'd got to get it all together,
hook it all up, one big circuit.
Well, I'm the only one that knows
anything about that shit so I get the job.
Everybody else is so ripped,
they couldn't change
a battery in a Jap radio.
I'm laying wire from hell to breakfast.
Took me about four weeks.
Half the time I'm so stoned,
I couldn't even talk.
- But by Christ, we did it.
-
One big circuit.
-We made this mountain boogie.
- l'd like to have seen that.
Where were you?
- Come on.
-What?
- Come here!
- No!
- Come on. Come on!
- No!
- Come on, let's go.
-
Come on, babe, don't be scared.
I want to see you strut your stuff.
When Dieter gets back,
we'll have a celebration.
We'll have some of that old-time weirdness.
-What are you doing?
- Come on, nobody's watching!
Oh, why not? Fuck real life.
That's right. Real life don't cut no ice with us.
# Hear that lonesome whistle blow
That's your cue and by now you know
# That I got another true lover
waitin' in Tennessee
# This midnight special's a-burnin' the rail
# So, woman, don't ty to follow my trail
# This golden rocket's gonna roll my blues away
# Hear her thunder on through the night
This golden rocket is a-doin' me right... #
-Wait a minute!
-What?
Sounds like a chopper.
That's either the border patrol or a bust.
That must be the main trail
going up to the house.
There's another one for you.
Several trails up there,
they're marked on the map.
-Which one do we take?
- That's up to you.
Read the map, for Christ's sake!
lt's pure smack, all over the seats.
- Maybe he can read it.
- Right. Who knows?
These people may be hostile
to those creeps up there.
They'll have knowledge about access routes.
This is different from what we had envisioned.
That's true.
Antheil's pissed off.
Let me make one thing clear.
Tomorrow morning
we'll have to act officially.
There will be local police involvement,
regulation procedure,
there will be arrests
and there will be confiscations.
Smitty, you get that?
The cops will grab the dope, right?
You'll get zip.
Shut up, smartass.
-We only got till morning to take it off...
- That's right.
You two going in with us?
To some extent. We'll be here to back you up.
Shit, you told me you had this place cased.
I don't even know how many people he has...
Any mishaps, just get out at first light.
I'm not kidding.
We're going to be all-over cops.
Right.
Let's go.
Antheil's not pissed off, he's scared.
Just shut the fuck up.
Don't say a word, not one word.
When you're supposed to talk, I'll tell you, right?
Right.
Hi there, fella.
Señor.
We're looking for
some hippies live around here.
You know, hippies, freakos, savvy?
- Guy named Ray Hicks is with them.
- Hippies?
- They live up on the mountain.
- I don't know.
-You know the way?
- I don't go there.
Hold it, tamale pie.
Going to show us the way there?
Si, señor.
Hey, schmuck. Chilli head.
- Is anybody coming, Sister Anne?
-  Hmm?
You're supposed to say,
''l see only the sun
''and the grass looking green'
How much of that shit are you doing?
Oh, I don't know. There's so much of it.
I can see you killing time on the road
but you'd better use some moderation.
Nobody can surprise us,
we've got the high ground here.
We can win this one.
You know that?
Huh?
Listen, if we can lay that stuff off,
we'll go down to Mexico.
I know some people there.
Hey, maybe we'll get a boat.
And who's going to be on that boat?
Where is that boat going to go?
lt's going to have to be some boat.
Hey, hey.
Don't fold on me, Marge.
Hmm?
Play some of that music.
OK.
Scumbag spic, wait up.
Christ, I hate this kemo sabe crap.
-
-Jules, you all right?
Shit. Should have worn sneakers.
# From old Montana down to Alabama
# I been before and I'll travel again
You triflin' women... #
What is that?
Where the fuck's that coming from?
How the hell am I supposed to know?
# I'm tired of running on the same old track
# Bought a one-way ticket and I won't be back
# This golden rocket's gonna
roll my blues away... #
Hey, schmuck, where's that...
-  Ah, shit! Watch out, man.
- Hey! Hey!
Goddamn it, man.
Get inside.
Who's shooting?
Where did he go?
Shit. I knew he wanted to run.
I didn't think he'd get it on.
Fuck it, man, they heard us.
Get inside and stay out of sight.
Can you read me, for Christ's sake?
Yeah. We lost Tonto.
We're in tree city. Who knows where we are?
What do you want us to do? Over.
Just keep going up. What else? Over.
Right. Come on, let's go.
-Jules, I got to get high.
- Shut up, schmuck. Come on.
-
- Come on, come on.
Move it, asshole. Come on.
Don't call me an asshole.
Those shots came from
a high-powered rifle.
- Could it have been a hunter?
- No. There's going to be a bust.
-We've been turned.
-Who by?
Eddie Peace. I should have
killed him when I had a chance.
Go get ready to sprint. Go on.
-  Ah!
- Mother. What a gyp, walking everywhere.
You go for this, asshole?
I beg your pardon?
You like this, trees and weirdness,
the great outdoors?
-Are we lost?
- I don't know yet.
I'll let you know when I find out.
-Why the hell are we walking downhill?
- How the fuck do I know? You're leading.
Holy shit. Phew!
Oh, wow.
- Hey, Jules!
- Shut up, idiot!
- Look at that.
- Get in here. Give me that thing.
- How the fuck do we get on the other side?
- How the fuck do I know?
Give me the fucking thing, will you?
Come here, schmuck. Get in here.
'Max 1, Max 1
We're on the wrong mountain.
What do you think of that? Over.
Tell me about it. Over.
We can see the place but we're fucked.
We can't do a thing from here. Over.
'How much closer can you get?'
About two more feet
then it's Grand Canyon.
All right.
Get in position. Take cover.
'Move Asshole up where they can see him.
'Tell them you'll shoot him
if they don't produce
What do they care? They'll laugh at us.
Make Asshole do the talking.
'He can use his influence on his wife
What do you think, schmuck?
You think she'll come through for you?
I don't know.
Let's go. Come on.
Ray! Ray Hicks!
ls that you, Pidio?
- Ray.
-What's up?
There are five guys with guns.
- Where?
- Three over there.
- They know you're here.
-Which side?
The other side of the canyon. Yes.
- The other two?
- In the valley.
You know something?
They may not be cops at all.
-  Marge!
-
Marge, it's John!
Stay in here. Pidio, check the back trail.
Tell her to give it to us or we'll kill you.
Give it to them!
Or we'll kill you.
You think this is funny?
- No.
- Then say it.
Or they'll kill me.
Ray!
lt tolls for thee, motherFucker.
-We have to do what he says.
- Stay here.
We have to stall them.
Say, ''Please let us go'
Please let us go.
-We have to dig it up.
-We have to dig it up!
Say it again, louder.
No. I'm going down.
I'm through. It just isn't worth it.
They can have the dope and me with it.
They're stalling.
Hey, lady!
We got your kid.
Marge!
- They're lying.
- How do I know that? How?
Then you tell them to produce her.
Produce her?
They're going to burn her with cigarettes.
For Christ's sake, they haven't got her.
She's with your family.
I'm taking it down.
- Hey, Jules.
-What?
I want to shoot that horse. Can l?
What an idiot.
What do you think they'll do? Let you walk?
-You'll never make it.
- No?
I'm coming down.
I'm bringing it with me.
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
No!
Hicks brings it down.
Not you. Hicks.
You heard them.
They want you to bring it down.
Negative.
Oh!
No! Stop!
Stop! I'm bringing it down.
- Please! Stop the shooting!
- Oh, wow.
I could put one right between her eyes.
Cut it out, cut it out.
Hicks won't do it.
I'll bring the stuff down, I swear it.
No! You heard me.
Hicks brings it down.
Hicks won't come down. Won't even talk to us.
Wife says she'll bring it down.
I don't know. They're getting foxy. Over.
Can you see her?
'She's right across from me.
I could hit her with a rock
Goddamn it, what's the problem?
All right. We'll just appeal to her finer feelings.
Let me talk to Asshole.
Here he is.
'Converse, can you hear me?'
Yeah, he can hear you.
'All right. Get down on your knees
ls he on his knees?
-
-  No!
He's on his knees.
Put your hands together
like you were praying.
- 'Are his hands together?'
-What are you doing?
'Are his hands together?'
Come on, don't be crazy. Do what he says.
- 'Are his hands together?'
-Yeah, he's praying, let's get on with it.
Wait! Please, don't shoot him.
Then tell Hicks to get his ass down here.
I'm tired of pissing around with you, lady.
Get the stuff or I'll blow his head off.
-  'if you shoot that man..
-
-
- If you shoot that man, no one comes down.
I repeat,
if you shoot that man, no one comes down.
- Fuck you.
-  'Hold it
if you don't go, they'll kill him.
No, they won't. They need him.
You won't go?
Marge, hurry up.
Do what you think is right.
I'm coming down.
'I'll give it to you if you let him go
I know.
All right. It's agreeable.
What do you mean, it's agreeable?
'lt's one of those times
when you have to be optimistic.
'We'll be waiting for her here
What do we do with Asshole?
'Just keep him with you and in one piece.
'You guys keep her in sight
as she comes down. Over
lt's agreeable.
Antheil better watch his ass, boy.
That Hicks will kill you.
Hurry up.
ls the trail marked clearly?
Yeah. Do you want a light?
No. No, Pidio. No light.
I'm going to cover you down the trail.
I don't want you to cover me
and I don't want any more stuff with guns.
Here. Talk to them about that.
We see you. Now bring it down.
She didn't even say goodbye. How about her?
They'll be waiting for her
in the amphitheatre.
lf I go down the goat trail,
the trail you came up,
I'd be right behind them, right?
Yeah. But, Ray, they are five.
They got my buddy, man.
And they're going to kill him
and that pretty lady.
How am I going to let them do that?
Do you see the way she walked to her fate?
Nothing but class.
She's the love of my life, no shit.
Beats the hell out of all of us.
Pidio, do the lights
in the valley still work?
I don't know, Ray. I think so.
Let me tell you how this works.
We're going to give them a show.
When you hear this go,
hit these and these.
Crank up the volume, then hit that.
Wait here for me. I'll be back.
-
-  Hey.
Let's keep together.
You all right?
- I could beat you to death, you know that?
-Absolutely.
-
-
Shut up. What the hell is the matter with you?
I don't know.
Pretty soon I'll either be
away from you or dead.
And either way is fine with me.
You want odds?
- On what?
- On dead.
Stop.
All right, come ahead.
- I have it.
- Shut up.
That way.
Drop it.
-Where's John?
- He's here.
You're safe now, Mrs Converse.
Where is he?
Shine the light on him.
lt'll be OK. You'll see.
-You got it?
-Yeah, we got it.
Keep going, hon.
This is your touching reunion.
- She brought it. Don't hurt her.
- No, no need, man.
Wait a minute. Hold it, you two!
They pulled a switch on us.
Run, Marge!
Over here, Marge!
Keep your head down.
Up here, Marge. Get behind those rocks.
# From old Montana down to Alabama
# I've been before and I'll travel again
# You triflin' women can't keep a good man down
# You dealt the cards, but you missed the play
# So hit the road and be on your way... #
Jules!
# ..and leave this town #
Jules!
# ..baby, I'm switchin' to another line
# So, honey, never hang your signal out for me... #
# ..One-way ticket and I won't be back
# This golden rocket's gonna roll my blues away#
-
-  Ray!
-Where are you?
-  Below you, to the right.
I'm coming in.
OK, I'll cover you.
# Hear that lonesome whistle blow
# That's your cue and by now you know
# That I got another true lover
waitin' in Tennessee
# This midnight special's a-burnin' the rail
# So, woman, don't ty to follow my trail... #
Johnny.
# Hear her thunder on through the night
# This golden rocket is a-doin' me right #
- The head guy, who is he?
- Some kind of cop. He's not straight.
-You don't say.
-
That guy's going to have to run for it.
Nailed him.
I got two of them boxed in.
I think the other two are dead.
You two can get out of here.
Here's what you're going to do.
Drive out of here to the highway.
Go west to the railroad tracks.
Pick me up there in the morning.
- Come with us.
-
lf those guys get to a radio, evey cop
in the state's going to be on our tracks.
I can keep them pinned down here for hours.
Meet me on those tracks in the morning.
Go on, for God's sake.
Wait a minute.
# Hey tonight... #
All right. Go ahead.
What are you waiting for? Go now! Go!
# Tonight
# Tonight
# Hey, come on
# Gonna chase tomorrow

Get in and turn the lights on, Marge.
I've got to get the keys. Hurry up.
Now!
# Gonna hear the sun

# ..watch me now
# Jody's gonna get religion
# All night long... #
Yeah. Yeah.
- Strap me up.
- OK.
Easy, easy.
When did you start that?
Johnny...
lt's your wonderful smack.
Mmm.
You can't stay this way, Marge.
I know.
I know.
He's walking out there.
Yeah. Let's go get him.
Hey, John!
I got it. I got it all!
You be there for me.
Don't cringe, man,
it don't do no fucking good to cringe.
# I don't know but I've been told
# Eskimo pussy's mighty cold #
Left, left...
Left, right, left.
# Ain't no use in going home
# Jody's got your girl and gone
# Ain't no use in feeling blue
# Jody's got your sister too
# I'm going to take a three-day pass
# I'm going to whup old Jody's ass
# Sound off! One, two
# Hit it again, three, four
# Bring it on down, one, two, three, four
# Three, four! #
Left, left...

He's dead?
No, no, no!
Ray! Ray!
No, he's not dead.
Marge, I've got to buy him.
No, you're not going to buy him.
Don't you touch him!
Don't touch him. Get out of here.
Stay away.
- No.
- Come on, Marge.
Semper fi.
Move over, Marge.
if we stay here and grieve,
we'll be just as dead as he is.
# Long as I remember
# Rain been comin' down
# Clouds of mystery pourin'
# Confusion on the ground
# Good men through the ages
# Tryin' to find the sun
-# And I wonder... #
-
# Still I wonder
# Who'll stop the rain
# I went down Virginia
# Seekin' shelter from the storm
# Caught up in the fable
# I watched the tower grow
# Five-year plans and new deals
# Wrapped in golden chains
# And I wonder, still I wonder
# Who'll stop the rain
# Heard the singers playing
# How we cheered for more
# The crowd had rushed together
# Tryin' to keep warm
# Still the rain kept pourin'
# Fallin' on my ears
# And I wonder, still I wonder
# Who'll stop the rain
# I went down Virginia
# Seekin' shelter from the storm
# Caught up in the fable
# I watched the tower grow
# Five-year plans and new deals
# Wrapped in golden chains
# And I wonder, still I wonder
# Who'll stop the rain
# Heard the singers playing
# How we cheered for more
# The crowd had rushed together
# Tryin' to keep warm
# Still the rain kept pourin'
# Fallin' on my ears
# And I wonder, still I wonder
# Who'll stop the rain #
