BARACK OBAMA:
of a long and painful chapter
for the people of Libya,
who now have the opportunity
to determine their own destiny
FEMALE REPORTER:
as a battle rages in Libya's
two largest cities.
TYRONE: It's loaded.
How's the team here?
Good.
Three ex-Marines,
one ex-Army Ranger.
It's nice having
another team guy around.
Good to see you,
brother.
Good to be back.
Oh, man, it's hot!
TYRONE: How are
the kids, Jack?
JACK:
They send their love.
Can you believe Emily's
about to start kindergarten?
She dating yet?
You better watch your mouth.
TYRONE: I thank God
I got three boys, man.
You're in for
a rough ride, Jack.
Payback's a bitch and her
stripper name is Karma.
JACK: You come up with
that on your own?
I saw it on
a T-shirt in Mexico.
TYRONE: Hey, check this out.
Remnants of
the revolution, man.
Is Becky still mad at me
for dragging you into contracting?
Oh, come on.
She's mad at me, she's not mad at you.
I'm part of the old crowd,
the old Jack.
The new Jack carries a
diaper bag instead of an M4.
Is this coming
from Tyrone Woods,
dental nurse,
who works for his wife?
TYRONE: Guess what?
Not out here, brother.
How's the real
estate business?
Pretty bad.
How bad is that?
I'm here, aren't I?
TYRONE: Well, this place sucks, Jack.
Not only is it hot as balls,
but you can't tell the
good guys from the bad guys.
Shit. No, no, no,
this isn't good.
Fuck!
Who the fuck
are these guys?
What do we got?
The brigade we coordinate with
is the February 17th Martyrs.
This ain't them.
Shit, we're boxed in.
Are we bailing?
Base, this is Rone.
This is Rone.
Come in. Over.
This is base.
Go, Rone.
TYRONE: I'm in a jam
off Fifth Ring Road.
I'm looking at about
eight armed Tangos here.
Copy that.
Sit tight.
TYRONE: "Sit tight."
That's great advice.
They got a KPV.
Base, we ain't
got all day.
KRIS: Hey, Rone.
They're trying to get Feb 17
to back you up,
but we're coming.
Hey, Oz,
I'm in a jam off Fifth Ring.
Ty.
Rone, 17 Feb QRF
is being alerted.
Fuck that.
The only Quick Reaction
Force I want is my guys.
No. Contact 17 Feb QRF.
TYRONE: Send them!
I want my guys.
Tell them they're not
allowed to leave the base.
Negative, Rone.
Just hang in there.
Maybe I'm not
making myself clear.
I'm looking at multiple
radical insurgents
with AK's and
a .50-cal technical
set to blow my Rover all the
way back to Zimbabwe. Over.
It's not my call,
brother.
Here we go.
Welcome to Benghazi.
TYRONE:
Libyan visa.
Official.
Libyan government.
Friendly? Hmm?
Friendly?
CLERIC: Pull over
for inspection.
No.
Pull over
for inspection!
I'm sorry, sir,
I can't do that.
Look up.
Go ahead, look up.
You see the drone?
No? That's all right,
because the drone sees you.
Sees your face.
We know who you are.
If anything happens
to us, your home,
your family, boom, gone.
Give the order
to let us go.
I want the car!
No, I'm not
gonna do that.
CLERIC: Look,
I earn right to decide the
future of my country.
You're talking
to the wrong guy.
How willing are you
to die for your country?
I'm ready to go,
right here, right now.
Leave here
while you still can.
We got air support?
We don't have any
fucking support.
Check the new rides.
Gaddafi had a going-out-of-business sale
on armored vehicles.
Max-level armored, man.
We got a great deal.
We stole them.
Sat unattended
at the airport.
Hey, Chief!
I don't want to
hear it, Tyrone.
Oh, no, no,
I understand.
I see what
you're going for here.
Secret spy base with fortified walls,
gate cameras,
and blue-eyed
Westerners
walking in and out of
this place all day long.
But if you want
to avoid...
That's so rude.
Can't believe he
just did that to me.
Chief, if you want to avoid
an international incident,
you give me my guys
when I ask for them!
Local faces need to resolve
local conflicts, Tyrone.
We're guests
in this country.
TYRONE: We're unwanted
guests, Bob.
CHIEF: We're spies,
you're security guards.
Your job is to keep us out of trouble,
not get into it yourselves.
Well, then help me do my
job and give me my guys.
Here's what you
guys are good at.
Working out,
eating five hot meals a day.
What you're not so good at
is doing what you're told.
Uh, I need your trace report
on yellowcake in five minutes.
It's coming.
That roadblock was run by
Ansar al-Sharia.
It's not just tribal groups and
freedom fighters anymore.
If you have useful intel,
Tyrone, put it in a memo.
You guys bunk here,
but you're not CIA.
You're hired help.
Act the part.
Where are my manners?
Jack Silva, this is our
esteemed Chief of Station.
CHIEF: Hey, Tig.
How are the twins?
Crazy cute.
CHIEF: Cute.
You have
a move tonight.
No recon, Chief?
What makes you Special
Operators so special
if you can't do what I
need when I need it?
He's fun.
OZ: Well, that was fun.
He gets his jollies pushing
around alphas because he can.
We had this commander
back in Ranger school,
he was a real cockbag.
So on our last night,
me and a buddy, we stole his beret.
The whole barracks
chubbed it.
"Chubbed it"?
Yeah, rubbed our dicks on it.
Leader was a former
Gitmo detainee.
Yeah, those guys
usually don't hold a grudge.
Jack. Mark Geist.
Oz.
Pleasure.
Oh, brother,
I'm sorry. Everybody, this is Jack Silva.
It's our third contract together,
so he knows the drill.
We met training
SEALs at Coronado.
How do you get them to balance
that beach ball on their nose?
It's tough.
So we got three ex-Marines here
and one ex-Army retard
who likes to rub
his dick on things.
Kris Paronto.
Call me Tanto.
Hey, man. I'm Tig.
Tig's been here the longest, so he'll
get you up to speed on the area.
This is Boon.
Scout Sniper, Zen Master,
holder of Tanto's leash.
Welcome to Club Med.
So it hasn't
rained since June,
it's not gonna rain
again until September.
You're double-bunked.
Not me, because I'm in charge.
The gym sucks,
food's actually good.
And the Base Chief
is kind of a tool.
Well, he's
a dick today.
Maybe he just needs
a new hat.
TYRONE: Don't encourage him.
Oh, come on.
He's a guy with a job to do.
He's playing his string out,
but you talk to him,
Bob did some shit
back in the day.
All right,
Jack, this is the whiteboard
that's gonna run your life
for the next 60 days.
I want you to
check it every hour,
because last-minute moves
pop up every minute, such as
we're shotgunning it
in three hours. Mmm-hmm.
TYRONE: Three hours.
I'll let you know when I'm briefed.
TIG: This was
a private family compound
owned by a wealthy Libyan who got
out of town after the revolution
and leased it to the CIA.
He was smart.
A little pungent.
TIG: Mmm-hmm.
A little spy tradecraft.
Who'd expect Americans
to be hiding out
next to a stank-ass
slaughterhouse?
We call it Zombieland.
Building A, B, C, D.
Hesham!
HESHAM: Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
He's a good man.
But there's a few we got our eyes on,
so always
stay strapped.
Damn kids!
TIG: This is the bathroom.
This is you.
That's me.
This curtain is meant to discourage
you from spooning with me. So...
EMILY: Daddy, what do you do
when you go away for work?
Can't you work here?
We could have a treehouse business.
Mmm-hmm.
That sounds amazing.
EMILY: Then we could
always be together.
You know, the girls don't need
a treehouse, Jack.
I just hope that one day,
you're not gonna wake up and realize
you missed the best
part of life.
CHIEF: You contractors
are all married with kids,
yet none of you wear wedding rings.
Why is that?
Our job
is reading people.
So, we can't give
anyone an edge,
especially bad guys
that might use it.
I know you and Tyrone
go way back,
so I'll be frank.
The company thinks
you should be here. I don't.
Truth is, there is
no real threat here.
We won the revolution
for these people.
The more guns
there are here,
the more likely there is to be
a misunderstanding.
This is my last station
before retiring.
I don't need
a misunderstanding.
Is that clear?
Loud and.
These are your credentials,
two weeks per diem.
I'd spend them quick.
Things change fast
here in Benghazi.
We have the brightest minds
from the Farm,
educated at Harvard and Yale,
doing important work.
Best thing for you to do
is stay out of their way.
TYRONE: Fuck!
Quiet!
You act
like animals!
TYRONE: It's a CPU
at Pepe's.
It's all pretty
simple stuff, guys.
Public meet.
Libyan oil company
exec and his wife.
Case Officers
Vayner and Jillani.
Jillani's been developing
this guy for months.
"Developing" is their
new tech word for spy shit.
Jack, since this is
your first time with us,
you're gonna be posing
as Jillani's husband.
Uh-oh.
I rode bitch last week.
She's a little spicy.
Oz, Tig, limo.
Boon, Tanto, follow.
You?
I drive.
TYRONE: Hey, Jack,
this is Sona,
she's an American
who grew up in France,
which makes her
really friendly.
Nice to meet you.
Careful, Jack,
I think she's flirting with you.
BRIT:  Okay.
Let's keep the make-nice to a minimum.
I want to hook
this guy tonight.
SONA: He wants
to work with us.
Move too fast and
you'll frighten him off.
I know how
to do this!
He's new.
Not to this.
I don't understand.
Why do they keep changing
security guards on us?
They think we
need babysitting.
BRIT: Okay. So just drink your coffee.
Don't try to help.
Don't talk, either.
My name is "Nazia,"
a lobbyist for Exxon Mobil.
Brit is "Peter," my boss.
And you're my husband, "Jack."
Hang on.
Jack's my real name.
It is?
Fantastic.
It's nice to see
you again, Fahreed.
Let me introduce
you to my boss, Peter.
Hi.
Hello.
And this is Jack,
my husband.
How are you?
Very nice to meet you.
This is my wife.
Nice meeting you.
FAHREED: Oh.
This is the best Italian restaurant. Come.
BRIT: Oh, fantastic.
FAHREED: Please, after you.
SONA: Thank you.
Hey.
What's up?
Hey, Oz. They're in.
You got eyes?
Yeah, just enjoying
a little Italian beanery here.
You wouldn't know
a good coffee bean
from a lump of squirrel shit,
country boy.
Just make sure you
pick me up a bag of
that whole bean
Arabica Intenso on the way out.
Fahreed, you can contact us
with this phone in the future.
Good.
BRIT: And if you give me
a call in three days,
I would love to
see the manifest,
and we can go
over the details.
Very good.
Perfect.
Hey.
What's the Chief's
number-one rule?
Don't get out
of the car?
No, I'm getting
out of the car.
He's on the move.
BRIT: Cairo is great!
Now, that is
an underrated city.
What I really love
is the Nile Valley.
The Nile Valley
is beautiful.
Yes, it's beautiful,
but it's too busy.
We had a bit of
a fight this morning.
SONA:
No, we didn't.
Good price. Two.
Two, sir. Good price.
The rocket.
Russian rocket.
Come on, Oz,
pick up the phone.
BRIT: We are weighing a serious
move on the Syrian market.
We got to go.
SONA: So, that's why we really
need your shipping support.
Sorry to rush off.
Babysitter.
I'm so sorry,
but we will be in touch.
Sorry again.
Let's go.
Go, go, go.
Go, go, go.
Go, go, go. Get in.
Don't you ever handle
me like that again!
Who the fuck do
you think you are?
BRIT: You never get out
of the car, ever!
You just fucking
blew that meet.
Picked up a tail.
See the green van?
That's your tail.
Shake and bake!
Green van behind you.
We're on it.
Make a left,
then another left.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
This is my second war tour!
I know what I'm fucking doing.
Well, this is my 12th.
If they got pictures of us,
then we need to get them.
I would love to,
but that's not our job.
"Protect, not engage."
The Chief's orders.
JACK: Got 'em right behind.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Get out of
the fucking road!
Oh, careful.
Rone, coming up on your left!
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Switch sides.
KRIS: He's on you tight, man.
He's getting aggressive.
Yeah. I see him.
I see him.
Jack, if he gets
too close, drop him.
Watch out!
I might not have
gone to Harvard,
but I'm pretty
sure that was a tail.
Hey, guys.
Hi, Daddy!
Hi, Daddy!
Hey! Good to see you.
Guys, guys, take a look.
Meet my new friend.
Isn't he cool?
BEVERLY:
He is a grand master
at catching flies.
All day, he just sits here
and grabs one at a time.
Are you gonna
shave your beard, Daddy?
Well, depends on
what Mommy thinks.
Beck,
what do you think?
BECKY:
JACK: How's kindergarten, Em?
EMILY: Today is my turn
to feed Winston.
Very cool, very cool.
Who is Winston?
EMILY:
Oh.
Mommy says I can bring
him home one weekend.
Be nice to have a man
around the house, huh?
Okay.
EMILY:
RONE ON RADIO:
BECKY:
Babe, I think I got to go.
It's just a muster call.
It's probably nothing.
Sorry.
Just tell the girls I say
I love them, all right?
I'll call you tomorrow.
I love you. Bye.
Silva! You're fucking late!
As usual.
Rone said you were in Tripoli.
What's the occasion?
Ambassador Chris Stevens
is coming in from Tripoli
Monday morning.
JACK: Well,
you'll be home.
Not anymore.
Three of us extended.
The Ambassador is staying at
the Special Mission Compound
I know.
I know it's a problem.
The Ambassador isn't some
dilettante political appointee.
He's there to win
hearts and minds.
Now, he can't
very well do that
operating out of
a classified facility
that doesn't
officially exist.
KRIS: If he's racking at the
consulate with his State detail,
then what fuck does this
have to do with us?
He's traveling with no staff,
just a two-man security team.
Now, the State guys don't know
the city like you guys do.
The Ambassador insisted
on local drivers,
but we won
that argument.
So we're chauffeurs now.
Highly trained,
highly paid chauffeurs.
Chief won't
go for it.
He doesn't want
us doing anything.
He didn't go for it.
But he got outranked.
Now, the Ambassador
deserves the best,
Hey. Right here.
These dudes.
Bad guy house your tail van
got towed to.
Yeah, smile,
motherfuckers.
It's just two blocks
from the compound.
ALEC: Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right.
Hey, what's the problem?
First of all,
tell them to calm down.
Everybody,
dial it the fuck down!
All right,
what is the problem?
look like fun.
There will be no striking.
All right? Get back to work.
How would you feel if you had to
protect Americans at $28 a day
and then bring
your own bullets?
Well, why leave security to
the professionals, right?
Gentlemen!
Welcome to the
You guys picked
the wrong month
for a bad
mustache competition.
Hundred bucks
on the line.
Got this one
in the bag.
Scott Wickland.
Tyrone Woods.
Dave Ubben.
Come on.
Let me give you the grand tour.
Huh?
TIG: I can relate.
KRIS: Wow.
OZ: It's like
the lobby at Caesars.
Damn!
Shit's bangin'.
Makes you forget
you're in Benghazi.
Hey, guys.
I'm Agent Alec.
Just dealing with some
Middle Eastern Keystone Cops
out at the gate.
Those guys
yell a lot.
What's your
setup here?
Our Ambo's residence in this half
of the villa is the safe haven.
Forced-entry,
blast-resistant door.
Security bars
on the windows.
Inside that
is our safe room.
Ambo have any
tactical experience?
Nah. He has us.
SCOTT: So, it's a nine-acre
compound, shotgun style
from here,
all the way
to the back.
I'll take you there.
His room links to State in D.C.
and Tripoli.
JACK: That's the TOC?
SCOTT: Yeah.
Back gate?
DAVE: One way only.
Emergency exit.
Got a couple 17 Febs
on detail, cameras.
It's locked.
What kind of firepower you guys
carry other than assault rifles?
We've got multiple
small arms.
And ammo in the TacOps Center
just beyond the cantina.
That way.
That's it?
I thought every embassy had standard
hard-target security measures.
Car bomb barricades,
full-time Marines.
Supposed to.
This isn't an embassy.
We're a temporary
diplomatic outpost.
Uncle Sam's on
a budget right now,
so I guess normal
security regulations don't apply.
Man, that's some real
"dot-gov" shit, huh?
SCOTT: It's like
our own little resort.
I hate to piss on
your party, ladies,
but five dudes with
M4s is not enough.
The locals on your front gate
are worthless,
perimeter's soft,
and this whole compound's
a fucking sniper's paradise.
Any big element
gets inside here,
you guys are
gonna fucking die.
Well, that's
heartwarming.
KRIS: What?
No offense.
Guys, we're a mile
down the road.
Anything goes down,
you call us,
I send Boon,
you're good.
JACK: Take care, guys.
What do you think?
A dozen years of military
experience between them, max?
Gonna be a fun week.
Djibouti, request
retasking ScanEagle.
DRONE OPERATOR: Copy that.
I have eyes on both.
TYRONE: Oz, sniper over-watch.
Get in position.
Amahl, you lived here
all your life, right?
Yes.
Is it true Gaddafi
only hired females
for his personal
security detail?
Yes. That is accurate.
Gaddafi might've been an evil asshole,
but he wasn't stupid.
I hate this part.
Here we go, guys.
OZ: I got the skinny
on the right.
Let me take the whack-out guy.
Amahl, tell this guy
to calm down.
Easy, easy.
AMAHL: He's saying bring
your weapon down.
He wants his money.
Okay, okay.
This is your money.
TYRONE: Amahl, tell this guy
to calm the fuck down.
That guy's whacked.
Your money.
KRIS: Hey, big man!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey! Jambo.
You know the jambo, yeah?
Come on.
AMAHL: Okay,
cool down. Okay?
Cool, baby.
Come on.
OZ ON RADIO: That guy almost
lost his head.
TYRONE:
KRIS: Mercenaries all
know the jambo, Amahl.
TIG: Base, we're looking
at a lot of Russian SA-7s.
Tell him to maintain eyes on
the truck as long as he can.
We're gonna
find his stash
and we're gonna level it
with a Hellfire.
Hi. Hi, Chris Stevens.
Sona.
Sona, nice to meet you. Bob.
CHIEF: Thank you for doing that.
It's my pleasure.
It means a lot.
So good to be back.
CHIEF: This is our CDOB, Alan.
Brit Vayner.
Alan, Chris Stevens.
Brit, pleasure.
Gentlemen, greetings.
Chris Stevens.
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Ambassador.
Nice to meet you.
Step on in.
AMBASSADOR: So between what we see
happening in Egypt with Morsi
and the current
destabilization of Syria,
yes, it's easy
to imagine
any number of scenarios
playing out here.
However, in my mind,
our biggest mistake would
be to not view this moment
as an opportunity.
Relationships between
governments are important, yes,
but relationships
between people
are the real foundation
of diplomacy.
And I believe that it is
our mission as Americans
to help Benghazans
form a free,
democratic and
prosperous Libya.
Okay. Thanks.
In my office, now.
CHIEF: Don't bother
apologizing. I'll do it.
Well, I won't.
'Cause I've heard the rah-rah
speech about politics and progress
a hundred goddamn
times before.
Well, then
I'll write you up.
Sweet.
Chief. Chief,
the guy's going on two hours sleep.
He had a late scout last night and
an early buyback this morning.
Yeah, buying up all
of Gaddafi's arms.
Let's count the fucking
sand particles
on the beach
while we're at it.
Those 30 Grails that you
took off the black market,
that's 30 airplanes
that don't go down.
I'm so sick of
your shit, Tanto.
If you can't figure out how
to act like a professional,
there are 10 guys waiting
to take your spot.
And I'm sure that
you'll be happy at home
being an
insurance adjuster.
That's the last
chance, Tyrone.
TYRONE:
the Ambassador has a private
meet at the Mayor's office.
So, we're looking at
a low-profile event.
We're here to back up State, so
just stay in the background.
SCOTT: Ambo's entering.
Dave, take right side.
TYRONE: Oh. What is this?
You've got to be kidding me.
JACK: So much
for a low profile.
SCOTT: Fuck me.
Who let them in?
America is here for you.
We are.
This? This is the shit
that pisses my wife off.
Any one of these people
could klack off a vest.
At least it'll
be quick, brother.
Don't be an asshole.
AMBASSADOR: A number of countries
have come forth and offered loans,
most recently Turkey.
AMBASSADOR:
Sir. Are we clear
on tomorrow?
I have been persuaded
in an abundance of caution
to remain inside the
compound walls all day,
given the 9/11 anniversary,
so no drivers needed.
Good night.
Hey.
These militias,
they have unlimited firepower
and they can coordinate.
You've got to
keep his moves low.
Yeah, it was supposed
to be closed door.
Someone from the city
council tipped the media.
Sean Smith,
meet Rone, Jack and Tig
from the annex.
Hi.
How you doing?
Sean was sent here to install
secure comms for the Ambo.
Ended up
supercharging our Wi-Fi.
Wish he could do
that at our residence.
I got security
clearance.
Maybe later this week
I'll come by.
SCOTT: Gentlemen,
we should be good here.
Call you later to check in.
Have a nice day off.
How'd it go?
He's a rock star.
Everybody in Benghazi
knew he'd be there.
KRIS: Oh, wait, no, no.
This is it. This is it.
This is Downey's line.
Hold on.
I'm just a dude playing a dude
disguised as another dude.
Classic.
From the U.S.
Department of State.
"Be advised.
Reports that a Western facility
"or U.S. installation may be
attacked in the next week."
Read and destroy.
AMBASSADOR: It is so nice to
be back in Benghazi.
Much stronger
emotional connection...
Green, spacious,
beautiful compound.
Reconnected with
February 17th...
Saw people taking photos
of the compound today.
Feel unsafe here.
My guys are concerned.
Hey, Nick?
It's the second time
I've noticed it.
SCOTT: Hey, Nick, Dave?
See if Feb 17
Well, get somebody who speaks Arabic
so we can ask them a question.
Yeah, come on,
put her on the phone.
Oh! Hey, baby.
Kid's discovered
she likes Doritos.
Yeah!
Yeah, that's okay.
You can eat it.
You can taste it.
Yeah, buddy,
look at your eyes.
Look at that.
Who does he look like?
What?
Daughter's drinking.
You drank when
you were 15.
Little girls
don't drink.
Disneyland?
How lucky are you guys?
What are you guys gonna ride?
EMILY:
JACK: Dumbo,
not Jumbo. Dumbo.
Em, did you thank Mommy?
Say thank you?
Yes, we did.
Yes.
JACK:
Huh? Yeah, I'll show them.
Hold on. Baby, that's not me.
That's mean.
Look at this.
NARRATOR: ...mate for 1.2 seconds
and the act is complete.
KRIS: Why would you
send that?
Anyway, if it was, it'd be the
best three seconds of your life.
We miss you.
Be safe. We love you.
Yeah, I love you, too.
What's he doing?
I want to eat those fleshy arms!
Come on!
BECKY: What about
the life insurance?
You gotta...
You got to pay it.
Okay, okay,
I'll figure it out.
JACK: And what are we doing about
the oak tree in the front lawn?
The removal's $700...
No, it's $1,200, not $700.
The guy's trying
to rip me off.
Becky, Becky, listen.
I'll be home in two weeks. Okay?
So I'll take it
down myself.
Then we're really gonna need
life insurance.
I know, I'm...
I'm trying.
I'm coming home soon.
MAN:
CHILDREN: McDonald's!
BECKY: Guys, chill out!
Turn it down!
Calm down.
Mommy's driving. Okay?
We'll take 25
Happy Meals, please!
BECKY: No, we don't want
Sir, can you just hang on
one more second?
We're so hungry!
BECKY: I know you are.
Just hold on.
But we want the toys.
Just give me whatever you want.
Six of whatever.
I've got six
hungry kids.
MAN:
Throw it all in there.
Daddy, we're having
a baby!
JACK:
Oh, Emily!
Becky, what did
she just say?
A baby. We're having a baby.
Another baby?
MAN: How many Happy Meals
did you want?
You can give me whatever you want!
I don't care.
MAN: Chicken McNuggets
or cheeseburgers?
BEVERLY:
We're having a sister!
No,
that's it, please.
FEMALE REPORTER:
outside the American Embassy
here in Cairo...
So, anything new
back home?
...to voice their
discontent and anger
about an American-made
amateur film
they say is insulting
to the Prophet Muhammad.
No?
Nothing?
Good talk.
They say that
although it's amateur,
toward the prophet Muhammad
and that is their red line.
Ooh, ooh!
What up?
Heard about Cairo?
Mmm-hmm.
Ah!
Enlighten me, Boon.
"All the gods,
all the heavens,
"all the hells
are within you."
TYRONE: Within me?
Within you.
I might have to think about that one.
KRIS: Ooh, ooh!
Be here all night.
All right.
Ooh, ooh!
You know, I do have a gun in
my cubby and I will use it.
SOLDIER: Good luck.
She's having dinner
with her contact.
We'll be back at 2200.
Yeah.
Well, I'm still waiting to
hear back from State on that.
Hey, listen,
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about today.
I don't know
what I was thinking.
I guess with what
we got going on,
I just wanted everything
to be right, you know. I...
I just wanted to
do it right, but
I'm so happy. I...
I can't believe it.
Um...
I miss you guys
very much.
I wish I was home.
I just
wish I was home.
It'll knock
your teeth out.
This is some
good guava shisha.
Yeah, I got you.
Is that
the front gate?
Holy fuck!
Go jock up!
SCOTT: I'm getting the Ambo!
ALEC: I'll take the TOC!
Follow me, Vinnie!
Watch your six.
What's going on?
Chris! Get your body armor on!
Get into the safe haven! Go!
Go!
Hurry!
Oh, my God.
They're everywhere.
What should we do?
SCOTT: Where's the M4?
Sean!
Dave, get your weapon
and move fast to villa.
DAVE:
ALEC: All DS be advised,
there are thirty...
...maybe 40 Tangos coming
through the Charlie-1 gate.
Hello?
Hello?
It doesn't work.
Phone! I need a phone!
SCOTT: Alec, call the CIA,
call the annex!
RONE ON RADIO: GRS, all GRS,
muster in the CP right now.
I thought it was
gonna be a peaceful night.
TIG: State's under attack!
State's under attack!
Let's go, man.
DS Scott, do you have
hands on the Ambo yet?
Moving package and guest
in the safe haven.
Get down there.
No, I need more
information than that.
What do we got, Chief?
How many?
Twenty to 40 attackers.
State personnel separated
in several positions.
What's that?
I hear AKs.
RPGs.
That's not good.
What do I do?
Get back down!
We're going back.
What's going on
out there?
TYRONE: Listen up.
None of you have to go.
But we are
the only help they have.
Two vehicles, staged and ready.
Let's go! Move! Move!
Are they coming in?
Jesus!
There's nowhere to hide!
Get in the other room! Go!
Get in the other room!
Tripoli?
Tripoli, Benghazi
is under attack.
The Ambo is in
the safe haven.
We need
immediate assistance.
HICKS: Magariaf pick
up the phone yet?
I got Op Center
at State in D.C.
U.S. Military
AFRICOM holding.
Yes, AFRICOM.
Firing and chanting.
Front gate.
Local guards ran.
Twenty to 40 Tangos,
that's a substantial force.
We got to go
right now, Chief.
We have no authority
at the consulate.
We have no jurisdiction
in this country.
We're not supposed
to be here.
But we are here.
We're coordinating
with 17 Feb.
They're gonna
take the point.
Absolutely not.
You have a U.S. Ambassador at risk.
Send us, Chief.
You've got to send us.
The Ambassador is
in his safe haven
with his body man.
You're not
the first responders.
You're the last resort.
You will wait.
We have no military
assets in country.
We have two paramilitary
assets in the country.
One just a mile away
from the Ambassador.
And the other?
I need a bag full of money
and a flight to Benghazi.
Scott,
there are Tangos
right outside your door.
Do not move.
Do not make a sound.
KRIS: Amahl!
Yes?
If we link up with 17 Feb,
none of us knows the language.
We need you, man.
Come on.
Hey, hey, what?
Tanto, I'm not a combat interpreter!
I'm not weapons qualified.
What is this?
Now you're qualified.
Get your helmet
and armor. Let's go.
That dude ain't
coming back.
Are you actually
trying to fuck me over?
No, that's not what I'm saying at all.
Just hold on!
Now, listen to me.
Losing the initiative, Chief.
Will you just hold on?
You're losing it.
You understand how that works?
Stand down.
Stand down!
Wait for my word!
At least let us
get eyes on.
Then we know if we
have to intervene.
And if there's an ambush
and you get entrenched?
Who rescues you?
Me?
Oz, you need to listen
to me very carefully,
leave now.
You don't go anywhere
near the embassy.
Pardon the interruption.
We need to go.
We've just started dinner.
Now.
Goddamn, you guys!
Every time I get close...
OZ: Put your
head scarf on!
I need your eyes and your
ears, not your mouth.
ALEC: Annex, we have
attackers on compound.
We need immediate help.
We are under attack.
COMMANDER: Spool up all
available SpecialOps.
I want teams
mobilized ASAP.
Stage them in
Sigonella, Italy.
Have F16s ready
on my command,
and I want SITREP
on all assets in 5 minutes.
MAN: We'll have eyes on
station in 46 minutes.
After ingress,
we'll only have 0:45 overhead.
We need to
manage his flight.
Keyhole tactics overhead
for close air support.
I'm just learning we've
got a classified CIA base
a mile away
full of Americans.
OFFICIAL: POTUS is about
to be briefed.
It's bulletproof.
It's bulletproof.
What's happening?
They might be
going away.
ALEC: Scott, can you get
the Ambo to an armored car?
KRIS: Let's go!
We got to fucking move!
Could be the start
of the Holy War.
BOON: You gonna fight
the Holy War in your shorts?
Strong move.
What the fuck
are we waiting for?
We're holding.
He's going with
Feb 17 again.
He doesn't want to
expose the annex.
Fucking mess.
It's like a damn fireworks
show over there.
Seriously, guys,
if the consulate ordered
a fucking pizza it would've
been there by now.
No. Fuck you.
Scott, they are bringing
diesel cans over to the villa.
Scott, they are
coming inside.
Okay, okay.
Get in the bathroom, crawl.
Go to the bathroom, go!
They are pouring the diesel
right by the door.
No, don't.
Don't you fucking do it.
Don't do it.
Oh, God.
Shit.
SCOTT: Get the towels.
Chris, where are
the gas masks?
AMBASSADOR: Oh, God.
SEAN: I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!
SCOTT:
See if you can get
hold of any other
quick-reaction
forces in the area.
Yes.
Follow me!
Follow!
KRIS: Jack, how bad?
ALEC ON RADIO:
They're digging
in now, Rone.
We need some
air support.
A Spectre gunship,
an ISR drone...
American firepower, man.
I know what we need.
Chief! Chief!
KRIS: Twenty minutes now.
It's going from a rescue
mission to a suicide mission.
Let us loose.
Lives are at stake.
You are not
direct-action elements.
JACK: Chief, think.
You let them
take that consulate,
where do you think
the next target's gonna be?
ALEC ON RADIO:
If you do not get here soon,
we are all gonna fucking die.
Amahl, get in the fucking car now.
Let's go!
Now! Let's go!
Amahl, stop!
Do not leave this compound, Amahl.
Get in, Amahl.
Let's go!
Amahl! You're not
cleared to go!
God damn it!
None of you are!
Say goodbye
to contract work.
You can't put a price
on being able to
live with yourself.
ALEC ON RADIO: Tripoli, we need
immediate assistance.
These assholes have no idea
what's coming for them.
Shit. You got to be
fucking kidding me.
I lost my contact.
Shit! I can't go
if I can't see.
You got to fix this, man.
You got to fix this right now.
Hey, funny man,
shut the fuck up.
TYRONE: You know where
you're going.
This ain't funny.
JACK: Hold up.
Now 17 Feb knows
we're coming, right?
And how do we
know that's 17 Feb?
Rone, what
are you seeing?
TYRONE: We're 300 yards
from the front gate, Chief,
but there's a roadblock.
CHIEF ON RADIO: Are they friendlies?
Feb 17?
TYRONE: Chief,
trying to assess,
but no one's wearing
fucking uniforms here.
Come on. Come on.
Oh...
I didn't get here late just
to die in friendly fire.
Use your gun.
Find out who
the commander is
and get this
organized quick. Go.
Go.
Stop!
Amahl, get cover!
Chief!
ALEC:
OZ: Get the Chief!
Are they gone? Yeah?
CHIEF: Yeah.
I had the rest of the staff
cover in their quarters.
Okay, Bob, Bob,
listen to me.
I want 100% accountability.
All right?
We're gonna harden
our defenses here in C.
This is gonna be
our fallback.
Hey, lock this building down!
You, you, let's go. Let's go.
Do it.
How can I help?
We're pushing forward.
Got to move, got to move.
Eight to 10 Tangos,
front gate.
and end this now.
Tanto! Let's get up high.
Rone!
This road's a chokepoint.
We'll get established,
let you know when
it's clear to advance.
We're getting our heavy weapons.
Be back.
Tig, get Amahl.
Tell 17 Feb to lock down this road.
I don't want anybody coming over here,
all right?
Let's go! Now!
Roger that.
TYRONE: Check this dude out.
Lucky we got that
guy on our side.
Hey, check these guys.
Hi.
Hey.
You 17 Feb?
Yeah.
Well, shit,
come on, let's go.
Four guys is
a fireteam, bro.
Just don't shoot
us in the back.
AMBASSADOR: Scott!
Chris! Chris!
AMBASSADOR: I can't breathe.
Chris!
Chris!
Tango approaching.
TYRONE: Tanto, get back.
We gotta move.
Contact, front!
JACK: RPG.
Incoming!
KRIS: Oh, shit!
Get cover, get cover!
Move right, move right!
Left! By the trees!
Ty, to the right!
Move, move, move!
JACK: Tanto, move.
KRIS: Go, go, hustle!
TYRONE: We're pushing
forward to the front gate.
Might want to get inside.
Wonder if they can
get the Broncos game?
Get high, get high.
I'm too fucking old
to be climbing walls.
Come on.
Jesus Christ, get your
gun out of my face, bro. Fuck!
Fucking amateur
hour, man.
DAVE: Is he inside?
Is the Ambo inside?
Is Sean inside? Scott, think.
Where did you see him last?
Let's get to the top
of this building. Let's go!
Up here we can cross over
to the bigger building.
RONE ON RADIO: Guys,
I need your eyes quick.
Copy that, Rone.
We are coming as fast as we can.
TYRONE: Easy.
I got four Tangos.
JACK: Who the fuck
are these guys?
You are Americans?
Yes.
These guys are watching
a soccer game.
Just another Tuesday night
in Benghazi.
TYRONE: We need sniper over-watch fast.
You got to move it!
We're blocked by buildings.
We got no vantage point.
Fuck.
Rone, this roost is a bust.
We're gonna keep moving.
TYRONE: Making our way
to the front gate.
Feb 17 is rolling with us.
Check those guys
on the left.
TYRONE: Tig, technical!
Knock out that technical!
Tig, you got to knock out that
technical right fucking now, man!
Tig, drop that
technical or we're dead!
Move, move, move!
KRIS: Rone, we've been
running about a mile so far.
Making it around to the
back gate of the compound.
CHIEF: On the GPS,
where are our teams?
They should be
coming back this way.
Look, they're right here.
Tanto and Boon are on
Gunfighter Road at the back.
Rone's team is about
to enter the front gate.
Hello, Captain America.
I'm fighting for my country.
You're welcome.
Guess we're going in.
State, we're on property!
State, we're coming in!
We're on property!
DRONE OPERATOR: Delta Pred checking
in on station.
We'll have eyes
on in two minutes.
TYRONE: Hey, talk to me, guys.
Where are they?
DAVE: I looked everywhere.
I can't find them.
I think they're
still in there.
You got bad guys inside?
We got separated.
I can't find them.
Our guys? How many?
Two.
God!
It's too hot!
Go around that way. That room.
Over here?
There.
Chris! Shit.
Jack, come here!
Let's go in.
Ready? Okay, go in.
TYRONE: Chris!
JACK: Let's go, let's go, let's go!
No one could
survive that.
Let's go.
TYRONE: Ambo!
JACK: Chris Stevens!
Ambo!
Chris!
Chris!
Chris!
KRIS: Shit,
I got to do more cardio.
Should be bad guys
coming out here.
Maybe they already
came through.
DRONE OPERATOR:
I have two friendlies, IR strobed,
back gate of the compound.
Hey, we are coming over the back gate.
Do not shoot.
Hey, those guys we just passed at the cafe?
Are they with us?
Friendlies?
No, mister, no.
We're going
over the wall.
Yes, sir.
If they shoot
at us...
Yes, sir.
...you kill them.
Okay, mister. Okay.
TYRONE: Chris!
Chris!
Chris!
God!
Chris!
Chris Stevens!
Tanto, it's like a goddamn
block party out here.
Get in here, dude.
You 17 Feb?
I'm a commander.
Good for you.
Once you get all
your guys through here,
you got to close
this gate, okay?
Okay? All right.
Okay.
KRIS: Wait. Who are
you talking to?
Who's on the phone?
Okay.
I call attackers.
Maybe I negotiate surrender.
Wait. You called the attackers?
You have their phone...
How the fuck do you
have their phone number?
I now a good boy.
But I know bad guys.
What?
TIG:
Yeah, dude,
I know, I know, I'm coming.
JACK: Follow my voice!
TYRONE: Jack, keep talking!
Ty, follow my voice!
TYRONE: Okay. Where are you?
Follow my voice!
TYRONE: Jack!
Jack, I can't see!
JACK: Ty!
Go, go, go.
Amahl!
Hey, I brought
these 17 guys, okay?
But I do think these
assholes, they were
trying to steal our cars.
They were the dudes who were
supposed to take point.
Yeah.
Now, this
is fucking bad.
KRIS: Rone, we're in the back of the
compound, we're going to the TOC.
Oh, shit.
Jesus Christ,
that shit is torched.
Who are these guys?
Whoa.
Soldiers! Americans
are in trouble!
Huh?
Your Americans
are in trouble!
Go, go, go. Go!
DAVE: Go, go, go.
JACK: Who is it?
DAVE: It's Sean Smith,
our IT guy.
Let's go.
Hold him up.
JACK: Tig, med bag!
SCOTT: I was just with him.
I was just with him.
KRIS: GRS moving
in on the TOC.
Hey, we're outside the TOC. Door's locked.
Anybody in there? Over.
TYRONE: That's it.
He's gone.
He's gone.
No!
He's gone.
Now is not the time.
Get yourself together, Tig.
No.
Don't waste your
energy, man. He's gone.
Jack, let's get his
body in the vehicle.
Pick him up.
All right, move.
Explain to me how all these
guys are friendlies.
Funny, I don't know.
Funny?
It's not that funny.
Who are you?
What are you doing,
coming out of the bushes like that?
BOON: Hey, inside the TOC, do you see us?
We need to come in.
You know that thing
where the initial assault
is just a ploy to draw people
in for the real attack?
Jesus Christ.
Open your door or I'm gonna
fucking blow it open!
Blue.
BOON: CIA!
Whoa! Hey!
Easy, Forrest Gump!
We need you.
Is there anybody
else inside?
No, no.
Glad you're here, brother.
Yeah, buddy.
Hey. Hey.
They're coming back!
They said the attackers are regrouping,
adding reinforcements.
Coming back
to finish the job?
Jack, help get State's
classifieds out of the TOC.
I'm gonna get DS
out of here.
AMAHL: You better hurry up.
Amahl, follow me.
Let's go.
Tanto, we got a situation
coming our way.
DS! Get in your car.
JACK: Tanto, blue, blue!
Boon's inside. Go.
Jack, what's going
on over there?
It's not good.
We got one KIA.
We got guys still in the bushes.
No Ambo.
They're still here.
I think we got
hostiles everywhere.
The fire has just
got to be cover.
They have control of the compound.
Why else leave so fast?
Black Hawk Down, man.
They're gonna drag his
body through the streets.
Amahl. Hey.
Amahl, pull it together, man.
Come on.
Come here.
Stop pointing your gun!
We ready?
On me. Here we go.
Let's go. Amahl, out.
Oh! Goddamn it!
This cockbag motherfucker!
Be advised the 17 Feb
tactical genius commander
left the back gate
wide fucking open.
All right, Boon,
this wall set as new perimeter.
Take cover, hold it.
We're getting DS out of here.
Let's go! Move!
Go inside, please.
Go back inside.
Get in the house right now!
In the house!
Fire sale!
Everything must go.
We got a large group of
bad guys headed our way.
We're gonna stay
and look for the Ambo.
You guys
need to exfil.
We're short two guys.
I got two more agents,
and I'm not leaving them.
Hey, Tanto, what's going on, man?
We got to move.
You dumb piece of shit!
You blew yourself up
trying to frag us, huh?
Yes!
Fuck.
Oh, shit!
Boon! Let's go back!
Jack, watch our six!
All right. Listen to me.
Listen, hey. Listen up!
When you go outside
that gate, you go left, you understand?
Yes.
You understand?
Haul ass!
Hey! Hey! Hurry up!
Let's go! Let's go!
Move, move, move!
Let's move!
To the right is bad guys.
You are going left.
You're taking the back
way to the annex.
You got it?
I got it.
Listen, I think somebody
else should drive.
No, I'm driving!
Blue! Blue!
No, don't shoot!
Move, move, move, move.
Second wave is coming!
They're flooding in
through the back gate!
Peel it! Peel it! Peel it!
Someone cover us
on the roof!
Amahl, on Tig!
Let's get these guys out.
I'm on the roof.
Don't leave me.
State. We are exfilling
the compound, minus the Ambo.
DAVE: No, no, no,
he said go left.
Left!
Scott, left.
No, he said right.
Go back
the other way.
Hey, get out of the way!
Back right.
Left! Go left!
SCOTT: Go! Go!
DAVE: Move, move, move.
SCOTT: Who's
this fucking guy?
DAVE: I don't know.
Maybe he's 17 Feb.
Maybe he's friendly.
Maybe he's saying
go the other way.
Go the other way.
JACK: No! Left!
Go left! Go left! Left!
I can't believe
we left without him.
JACK ON RADIO:
RONE ON RADIO:
JACK: Tig, on your right.
TYRONE: Down road, back gate.
Tangos left.
Hey. No way these guys
are in for the night.
They got a little taste of victory.
The annex is next.
Tanto, Boon, consolidate.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's go!
Exfil!
Get that door open!
That was intense.
TIG: I forgot the
grenade launcher.
DRONE OPERATOR: We got a mover.
State armored car leaving compound.
AFRICOM OFFICER: Target vehicle intercept.
Downrange 22 degrees.
DAVE: We just went
in a circle, Scott.
What is this shit?
SCOTT: Who is this?
What is he saying?
This is a bad idea.
Just go.
DRONE OPERATOR: Target vehicle has stopped.
Tangos converging from all sides.
ALEC: Who the fuck is this guy?
Who is this guy?
Who are you?
He's doing this.
I think he's trying to say he's friendly.
No, we don't know these guys.
This is not safe.
ALEC: We don't know them.
We're not safe here.
VINCENT: Two guys on the balcony.
Two guys on the balcony.
We need to
get out of here.
DAVE: Who is that?
It's a trap, Dave, it's an ambush!
We've got to move!
ALEC: He might be trying
to keep us from an ambush.
Who are you?
Back up while we can.
Back up while we can.
SCOTT: Who are you?
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Go, go, go!
Push through!
DAVE: Keep going!
Keep going! Keep going!
Go to the right! Go to the right!
Go right! Go right!
VINCENT: Damn it.
Run them the fuck over!
We've got three cars
coming up on our ass fast!
VINCENT: Punch it, punch it!
DRONE OPERATOR: Light fire pursuit of
target vehicle half-click south of annex.
State. We're under heavy fire!
We're on run-flats!
AK coming up eight o'clock!
This window's not gonna hold!
Shoot that
son of a bitch!
DAVE: Shoot him!
RPG!
Coming in!
Hey, easy, Rone.
Try to blend.
JACK: We are.
With a dead body in the back,
bunch of heavily armed operators
just going back to hide
in our covert CIA base.
Hey, we got a tail.
Two of them.
TIG: Annex, we got a tail.
Two or three vehicles in pursuit.
Start the destruction phase.
Plan to evacuate.
KRIS: Hit it, Rone.
How we looking?
You lost them, Rone.
You lost them. You're good.
You sure?
Yep. Yep.
That's because he
knows where we live.
Guard, get in the tower!
Chef, you ready to
get in the fight?
Anyone comes over these walls tonight,
we're kicking some ass.
ALEC: Keep moving.
Keep moving.
VINCENT: Contact rear!
Go, go, go, go!
DAVE: We're coming in hot.
We're closing in
at about 100 meters.
OZ: Let's go! Shut the gate!
Hey! Hey, get back inside!
Get back! Now!
Go back inside.
Vinnie, give me a hand.
Let's get him to medical.
Go. Take him.
Does that need attention?
No, no. I'm good.
It's a flesh wound.
Let me do
something to help.
I need men east side.
Take Building D.
We need all the help we can get.
Let's go.
You guys got
the gate? Gate!
Hey. I had extra ammo
brought up to the rooftops.
Libyan guards are
positioned in the towers.
Should've turned left.
Get some water
and reload!
Who's gonna
bring him inside?
TYRONE: He stays
right here, Chief.
When we exfil out,
it's gonna be quick.
What about
the Ambassador?
No one could
survive that.
Right now,
we need men on the roof.
I want to make
a run for the airport.
Maybe you
haven't noticed
it's open season on Americans
in Benghazi right now.
Rone.
Every extra mag
loaded now.
Don't take your eyes off
the exterior cameras.
Rone, you realize if we stay
here that we are screwed.
Then why don't you get us
some fucking help, Bob?
Tell AFRICOM you're calling
from that classified base
they didn't know existed
until an hour ago.
You be very specific. You get a
Spectre gunship and an ISR Pred.
There is a drone from Derna
overhead right now.
The gunship is out
of fueling range.
That's what
they're telling me.
I'm ordering
the evacuation.
You're not giving orders anymore,
you're taking them.
You're in my world now.
I... I tried to find him.
No gunship?
Six hours till dawn.
Entire city knows where we're holed up.
When they come,
we're gonna unleash hate on these guys.
Let's set our priorities.
We're gonna continue
our base destruction protocol
until it is finished.
We're gonna exfil from
here in 30 to 40 minutes.
We're gonna go directly to
the airport and get a plane.
If that doesn't work,
we're gonna go to the port and
we're gonna steal a fucking boat.
If any one of you gets separated
from the group at any time,
memorize this number.
The CIA satellites will pick
you up where you are located.
If there's anyone
who has local assets
with friendly militias,
raise your hands.
You need to assure me
that those people are safe.
They're gonna secure
our exit and escort us out of here.
Call them right now,
immediately.
I want all heads
of department over here.
And I want a fucking war room.
We're gonna make our finalized plans.
Now, listen, listen.
You're trained to do this.
It's your job.
You can do it.
We're all responsible
for our lives,
and what you do
right now in this room
will determine
whether we live or die.
GLEN: Tripoli, we're here, getting on
the oil executive's jet.
GRS is back safe. Compound's lost.
Still no sign of the Ambo.
State's already
blaming Al-Sharia.
You're with Delta?
What, just two of you?
We're it, brother.
Okay.
That sucks.
There's our bird!
Let's move.
CHIEF: That's supposed
to be a phone number, and it's not.
You need to translate
this right now.
Did you get these?
Destroy those.
Listen, listen!
I'm having trouble hearing you,
but our sources are
checking every hospital.
CHIEF: Have you alerted the Pentagon and CIA?
Are they talking?
SONA: Amahl!
Amahl, what did you see?
Are you hurt?
Amahl, what's
happening out there?
It's so bad. It's not good.
KRIS: Amahl!
Amahl,
can I get my gun?
Sorry, buddy,
I think I'm gonna need it.
Shit.
What's the situation
out there?
Grab a gun, meet me on the roof.
I'll tell you all about it.
He isn't serious,
is he?
'Cause that's his job,
that's not my job.
He is serious.
Come on up! Check it out!
Listen up, guys!
I'm gonna take Building C. Jack, Tig,
I want you on Building D.
Building A, Tanto, Boon.
Building B, DS guys, that's your territory.
Oz, Tower 1. Zombieland.
Let's go. Hit it.
Move!
KRIS: Let's go!
Let's go! Let's hustle up!
OZ: Rone, I got the tower!
Getting up on C!
They're just
the local shepherds.
Hey, what's going on?
We got a neighbor at the gate
complaining about our lights.
What, does he think we're
having a pool party?
He says the lights are bad.
They're going to find you.
"They"?
How the fuck does he know who
"they" are? Ask him.
He's already gone.
KRIS: Guys, we really need to do
something about these lights.
We've got to shut
all these lights down.
TYRONE: Hey, guys, keep your
IRs pointed up for the gunship
that's hopefully
fucking coming.
Time for stealth
has passed.
Viper, keep the perimeter
floodlights on.
Shut off the interiors.
Roger that. Roger that.
Come on, come on.
In Iraq, we had Black Hawks to
get us out of shit like this.
Yeah. Well,
here we got nothing and no one.
Kill the interior lights!
I'm trying, man.
Hello.
Surreal.
Different world.
Who's this?
Amahl, are those cars coming
from the neighbor's house?
Hey! Where the fuck
are they going?
Guys, we just lost
all our Libyan security.
Does it seem
like everybody knows what's
going on around here but us?
That's for sure.
Strobe's on, marking our position
for the Predator.
I hate to
break it to you,
but I don't think we're
getting any gunships.
Oh. Hell no. Air support?
That'd be too easy.
TIG: Viper, turn off
these goddamn interiors
or I'm gonna shoot
them out myself!
I'm working on it.
He's having a bad night.
Fuck.
Oh!
Sorry, guys.
I'm just a bit nervous.
Wow. Thank you.
BOON: Rone, which way
you think they're coming?
When they come, they're
coming through Zombieland.
That's strange.
That cop slowed down, then sped back up.
KRIS: I feel like I'm in
a fucking horror movie.
Chef?
Yeah?
Put that down
right there.
You go downstairs, make sure
everybody in this building's safe.
CHEF: Got it.
TYRONE: Oz? This is where
we make our stand!
It's dark out there.
BOON: Hey, Rone,
we're going to Building B.
It's better vantage.
Get those DS guys
off of there.
State!
I want you to go down and protect
Building C from the ground.
OZ: Guys, let's set sectors of
fire with overlapping coverage.
Tig, I can use you
over here on Tower 3.
Oz, what do you got?
OZ: I got a couple
of local shepherds walking.
KRIS: Hey, State, we got this.
Lot of acreage out there.
Get on your NODs.
Copy that.
Hey, Chief. Are we expecting any
friendlies to set up a perimeter?
CHIEF: Uh... Not that
I know of. Why?
KRIS: 'Cause we got cars
amassing, east side.
In the parking lot
out by that house
where the teenagers are that
throw the M-80s over the yard.
Then I guess it
could be poker night.
Just hold on.
Hey. I got two
cop cars pulling in.
KRIS: Chief, are we expecting
any of Benghazi's finest anytime soon?
CHIEF: Let me
check on it. Hold on.
Yeah. Take your time.
Alan, check
the perimeter.
Call Benghazi police
and see if that's them.
KRIS: Chief, these cops? I bet
you they work for the bad guys.
Does this look
like 17 Feb to you?
Dude, how can
you fucking tell?
They're all bad guys
until they're not.
BOON: And there go
the cop cars.
I got movement.
You see this, guys?
Yeah, I see it.
TYRONE: Boon,
how many you see?
I got unknowns moving
to the parking lot.
Fifteen Tangos.
I gotta call you back.
OZ: Good vantage point
from here.
TYRONE:
OZ: All right.
I got five more guys
right behind them
little shepherds.
One of them's got something slung.
I can't see what it is.
TYRONE: Everyone's got
weapons in Benghazi.
Until you see a weapon
in someone's hands,
you do not fire.
I don't want anybody
going to prison.
Roger that.
Okay, they're breaking off.
It's game time.
BOON: Guys,
they are coming in.
Oh, yeah, they're coming in now.
Come on.
Chief, if we're
expecting any friendlies,
I need to know
that information now.
I am not aware of any friendlies.
I have no confirmation.
DRONE OPERATOR: AFRICOM,
ISR is approaching target coordinates
AFRICOM OFFICIAL:
DRONE OPERATOR: AFRICOM, unknowns are
advancing toward subject compound
moving from south/southeast
over open ground.
No tags or colors.
Asymmetrical movements.
ISR TECH: Cyclops
pushing in at 140.
State, we're being surrounded
by Tangos right now.
Chief, this shit's
starting to get real.
Oz, we got seven
Tangos by the pillars.
OZ: Got 'em.
Let 'em come.
KRIS: Chief, are we
cleared hot to shoot?
Chief, I repeat,
are we cleared hot to shoot?
See a weapon,
shooter's discretion.
Everybody hold. You do not fucking
fire till I give the word.
I ain't shooting
no kids, Boon.
All right, guys, eyes open.
I'm gonna paint
these guys with the
infrared so we're
all on the same page.
Everybody got this guy?
BOON: Roger.
OZ: Yeah. I got him.
KRIS: This guy?
BOON:
Got him.
KRIS:
OZ: Got him.
BOON:
How about that guy?
Three.
OZ:
KRIS: Look at these guys.
It's like kids playing hide and seek.
I got AKs.
TYRONE: You guys got
to draw them in.
Draw them in.
They cannot see you.
We have night vision,
they don't.
Turn the lights off now.
KRIS: How much closer
do we let them get?
OZ:
Come on, Rone,
they're right here.
OZ: We got about
I'm taking
the right side.
OZ: Tig, you hit?
You all right?
Armor caught it.
That's a mistake.
Dude, we kicked
their asses!
I don't know if I'm
feeling lucky or unlucky.
They thought they were walking
into another temporary embassy.
Not here, brother.
KRIS: Chief, get us some air support, huh?
Get us fucking something!
GRS, check in.
BOON: All good, Boon,
Tanto, Building B.
D was out of the fight.
Tower 3,
Tig and Oz, never better.
Let's get you up.
Stay down.
BOON: Bad guy's house
is still active, Ty.
We got eyes on.
Roger that.
They shot out
all the lights.
First wave
got the job done.
You want a coffee?
I sure as hell do.
OZ: I guess the drone saw
Come on.
DRONE OPERATOR: Secure
with tech two encryption.
Why is this shepherd walking
around after a gunfight?
So bizarre.
OZ: These sheep
freak me out.
Somebody could take
a potshot from in there.
I don't think
it's safe.
Let's get out of here.
Dave, you got to slow it down, buddy.
You're working too hard.
Look, this isn't
a choice for me.
We lost the Ambassador.
That's on our heads,
not yours.
And, look, I get it.
I know what you're thinking.
But if Scott had fired on
that mob from the safe haven,
it would've given
away his position.
And we wouldn't have had
a fighting chance in hell
to get him out.
So, I'm in this fight.
All night.
I know you are.
I get it, man.
Hey! Hey, what's going on?
Where are our rides?
Look, this is all screwed-up
Libyan bureaucracy. Okay.
Who drives, who goes first,
and of course who gets paid the most.
We don't have time for this!
You tell them to figure it out.
Keep a close
watch on them.
We don't know who's good
and who's bad.
Copy that.
We're wheels down,
but we got a problem.
What do you got?
Coffee.
Amahl.
Yes.
Tell him he should assemble his
men as quickly as possible
and that
we will pay him.
Cash.
Cash? Fine.
When? When can
they be here?
Where's the Chief?
Just bring... That he brings his
fucking men as soon as possible
and get us the hell
out of here.
Looting the compound.
Blood in the water.
Sharks are circling.
The Tripoli team is
stuck at the airport.
They need an escort.
They don't know the city.
No love from
the Libyan government?
They've gone
home for the night.
Or just not answering.
What about ours?
They picking up
the phone?
I'm working on it.
That drone feed's up.
They're seeing everything
we see and more.
PILOT: We've identified the
forces that can move to Benghazi.
They're spinning
up as we speak.
MAN:
to secure the approval
from the host nation.
General, this could
be a hostile airport,
so we are considering
every option.
Understood.
It's a fluid situation.
But there are a lot of
Americans stuck there.
I say we get them airborne,
then we can make our decision.
Hey, Glen, we've been
waiting for three hours.
Can we just commandeer
these vehicles and go?
Getting in isn't the problem.
Getting out again is.
Hey!
Can you explain
to them
that if this bullshit ends
up costing American lives,
I'm gonna come back here and
cut all their throats myself,
starting with him.
You tell him that.
What a shitshow.
State got a report from the
Benghazi Medical Center
that said a crowd of Libyans
brought in an American male
alive.
They used Scott
Wickland's phone,
said it came
from Chris' pocket.
Could try
and draw us in.
Watch out
for an ambush.
What do you see?
I'm not sure
what it is.
Either the bad guys are
crawling under the sheep
or the sheep
are humping.
I don't know
anything about sheep.
OZ: Watch your step.
Oz.
OZ: Stay low.
Stay low.
I brought you candy bars
and some drinks.
Your head.
It's nothing.
You need anything else?
Well,
a lawn chair
wouldn't be bad.
Right. No problem.
And a gunship.
I don't think we're gonna
be able to get you that.
I'd settle for
a few F16s.
Low fly-by
over the city would
put the fear of God
and the United States in them.
Buy us a few more hours.
How long can
you hold them off?
Any large force with any real ordnance,
I don't know.
You got contacts
here and at home?
Start making
some calls.
Hey, the stripper's here!
Here are your clothes.
About time.
How are the Jason Bournes
doing downstairs?
Everyone's scared.
I just got a text from my cousin,
you know, a warning,
saying to leave
before it's too late.
More good news.
Anything more
specific than that?
I don't think we need an
interpreter anymore, Amahl.
You did good.
You should go.
No. I'm staying
here with you guys.
I'll be downstairs.
I'm gonna have to break up with
him before we leave Libya.
JACK: How do you leave me
on D when the party's right here?
Hey, about this
whole Ambo story,
I don't buy it.
And if he is still alive,
Glen's team's gonna get him out first.
If they do,
they're not gonna get to us.
So we've got to be prepared
to be here for a while.
Chief said it was
on the news back home.
Something about street protests.
Anti-Islamic films.
We didn't hear
any protests.
It was reported
in the news, buddy.
JACK: Hey.
You see that?
At the end of Smuggler's Alley.
Take a look.
Could be a second
front forming.
Or an audience gathering
to watch the show.
KRIS:
I know you've had some
pearls of wisdom tonight,
but are we expecting
any friendlies?
I got a lot of
movement out here.
Looks like we're
gonna get hit again.
Dave, take Zombieland.
Oz, with me.
Grab a shield.
Grab a shield.
KRIS: Chief, tell them to get the
Hellfire on that Pred ready.
Be advised,
ISR saying that cars
and bodies are massing
in the parking
lot to our west.
KRIS: Yeah, Chief,
I just put that out
over the radio
about two minutes ago.
Tell the ISR guys they're
pretty much worthless.
Fucking smartass.
Come on, come on, come on!
Send.
OZ: Chief, we got
Hey. Is that thing loud?
Oh, yeah.
I forgot my earplugs.
TYRONE: Keep your eyes on
your assigned quadrants.
We don't want
to get flanked.
You ready, Tig?
Here we go.
Watch for different tactics.
Oz?
You lose
your tampon?
JACK: Tig,
watch the pine trees.
KRIS:
What is this
yo-yo doing?
KRIS: You think they don't
know we have night vision?
TYRONE: GRS, I want
everybody to hold.
BOON: No, no, no, no.
What are you doing?
No, don't do that.
Fuck!
Get down!
What? Louder!
CHIEF: Stop!
Stop shooting!
firing at them!
Somebody started
shooting at us first!
And they're still
fucking shooting at us!
Tell them to
stop shooting at us
and we'll stop
shooting at them.
If they're shooting at you,
just fucking shoot back!
That's what I'm telling you!
We got 30 guys firing at us!
JACK: Tig, tree line.
OZ: They're flanking
us from Zombieland!
Move!
Moving!
Upstairs window.
Bus.
We got big ordnance
coming out of there.
Hit the bus!
That one's for us.
KRIS: You're not
getting away this time!
You think they're
losing heart?
SONA: Everyone, over here.
Find me every airbase in the
area that can reach us.
BRIT: Find me any
quick response teams,
any Navy carrier battle groups
in the vicinity, now.
CHIEF: I hear they have
a US CIF team in Croatia.
MAN: That's a two-hour flight.
SONA: Sigonella,
Aviano, Benghazi.
How far is Aviano?
There's an F16, 365 days 24/7.
It's a quick response base.
Well, bring it in
from Sigonella.
It's a fucking puddle jump
from Italy to here.
It's 20 minutes.
SONA: I'm not
requesting firepower.
All I want is that you give
these assholes outside our gate
a low, loud
"fuck you" flyover.
My authority?
My authority
is that if you don't send,
Americans are going to die.
Including the one
talking to you right now.
You see that, dude?
There's guys on those rocks over there.
There's nothing there.
Your eyes are playing tricks, man.
Why don't you go take a break?
No.
I'm okay.
Tig, take a break.
TYRONE: Hey, Tig.
Go on down, man. I'll spell you.
Oh, those State guys.
Dave up on C, you should see
the look in his eyes.
These guys are gonna relive this
night for the rest of their lives.
My whole mindset?
Never feel that.
You go down shooting,
balls out, every time.
How you doing,
brother?
Down time's the worst,
isn't it?
Adrenaline leaves and your
mind just starts to wander.
Oh, yeah.
I haven't thought about
my family once tonight.
Thinking about them now.
Up here in the
middle of all this,
I'm thinking
about my girls, man.
Thinking
what would they
say about me?
"He died in a place
he didn't need to be,
"in a battle over something
he doesn't understand,
"in a country that
meant nothing to him."
Every time I go home to
Becky and those girls, I think this is it.
I'm gonna stay.
And then something happens
and I end up back here.
Why is that?
Why can't I go home?
Why can't I go home
and just stay there?
Warriors aren't
trained to retire, Jack.
Becky's pregnant.
You kidding me?
She told me today.
And that can't
be the last call.
That can't be the last call,
'cause I'm sitting up here
and I'm thinking about some
other guy raising these girls.
Man, I'm sorry.
No, no, hey...
I shouldn't have...
Mmm-mmm.
No, man, no... It's all right.
I get it. Okay?
You go to them.
I know what it's like
to be in a place like this,
let another man
raise your children.
When I was young, I was giving
myself to something bigger.
Jack, that something
bigger's gone now.
But your new son?
Kai is your
second chance.
I might actually not
be a half-bad father.
"All the gods, all the heavens, all the
hells are within you."
What is that?
Something Boon
dropped on me earlier.
And it's just been going
around in my head all night.
CHIEF: We have some clarity
on a couple of issues.
The Tripoli team has cleared the airport,
and they are on their way.
You've got to be kidding me.
It's about time.
CHIEF: We also
have confirmation.
But the earlier report
that he was admitted alive
He was apparently found
in the back of the villa
and brought to the hospital
by a crowd of Libyans.
Cause of death is
smoke inhalation.
Shit.
You know,
we could've saved him
if we'd gone when
we got the call.
We could've
saved them both.
Yep.
You know, they're gonna
get this figured out.
Come at us with
technicals next.
We'll have to get down off this
roof and engage them direct.
Yeah, I know.
I never really
get scared.
Is that weird?
Whenever bullets start to fly,
I always feel protected.
You know, like it's...
As long as I'm doing the right thing,
God'll take care of me.
But that's crazy, right?
Not any more than
everything else you say.
Hope God has
a sense of humor.
Yeah.
I guess we'll
find out soon enough.
I had a good
call home today.
Yeah?
Talked to my kids.
Me, too.
OZ: Hey, we need somebody on
Building A eyeballing our visitors.
Yep.
That's me.
You good, brother?
Yep.
Hey, man.
It's been fun,
right?
Yeah.
It's been fun.
What, do you mean they
don't know where it is?
Our Libyan friends here
aren't much help.
Okay, annex,
we're officially lost.
Neither Google or Siri know
where the fuck you are.
Let Tripoli ops know
I'm lassoing our location.
There should be an IR
lasso visible right now.
There. There it is
up ahead. I see it.
Man, I could crush
some pancakes.
Smothered with butter.
Some of that whipped cream.
Chocolate chips.
I'd do any of it right now.
KRIS:
I don't know if this is
an awkward time to tell you,
but I've had to take a crap ever
since we left the consulate.
Way too much
information, brother.
KRIS: Hey, Chief.
We're expecting
more than one car, correct?
CHIEF: I am not aware of any friendlies.
No word.
I got three Tangos in a car coming
up to the front gate, right now.
Coming in hot.
They stopped.
Come on.
TYRONE: He better
have a weapon.
Show me a gun.
JACK:
KRIS: Nope.
No gun, just a phone.
I want to shoot
this guy, Rone.
Rone, I'm gonna
shoot him in the face.
What's he doing?
He's turning around.
He's pulling out.
He's taking off.
Could be someone
using their cell phone
to get target
coordinates.
All right. Weird shit's
starting to happen now.
I've had just about enough
of this 2012 Alamo bullshit.
Can we get the fuck
out of here now?
I know I blew an
eardrum earlier, but
did all the chanting
just stop?
Guys, this sucks.
Every Ranger knows
dawn is when the French
and Indians attack.
I'm feeling
lucky tonight, Tanto.
KRIS: Chief.
Are we expecting some trucks,
or big mounted technicals?
Blue, blue!
Cavalry's here!
KRIS: Yeah. You're looking a little light,
but welcome to the party!
Middle East
never lets you down.
Personable, organized,
easy to navigate.
Makes me need
a fucking drink!
Where's my frogman?
KRIS: Building C, up top!
We gonna exfil now?
KRIS: Get us to Tripoli,
brother, I'll get you wasted.
I'm the Commander
of the Libyan Shield.
Thank you for coming.
Sir, we're tasked with sensitive
document destruction.
OZ: Not a moment too soon.
RONE: Hey, Glen!
GLEN: Anyone call
an airport limo?
What's up,
brother Bub?
Good to see you, brother.
Sorry I'm late.
I got hung up in the gift shop.
Oh. You guys made
a mess up here.
Would've waited for you,
but people crying and dying
over the radio, man.
We didn't have
the heart for it.
Hey, Rone, I'd like
to tell you it's over, but it isn't.
The 24 CIA staffers here,
plus five State guys,
plus six GRS, plus us.
I get it. Too many.
There's no room
in the jet.
You think you can hold things
down here for a few more hours?
I'll tell you what.
These are some
hellish warriors.
I'd be lucky to have
their back any day.
Hey, Dave!
DAVE: Yo.
Lucky day.
Head on down.
Safe travels, buddy.
Thanks.
I'll grab my gear.
Hey, where's Silva at?
Over on D.
Yeah?
JACK: I didn't think
you were coming.
Figured you had
something better to do.
Dude, I was.
Then there's all
that "never leave
a brother SEAL
behind" bullshit,
so here I am.
Long ride to the airport ahead of us.
I'll see what the hold-up is.
Hey, hey, hey!
Where the hell are you guys going?
Chickenshit!
Guys.
Did anyone else
hear that?
TYRONE: Mortars incoming.
Get cover!
I'm hit! I'm hit!
Oz, I'm coming!
Rone! Rone!
MAN: This is Langley.
Give us your stat.
Building A, what's going on?
Check in.
KRIS: Get Deltas
up on the roof now!
DELTA: Blue, blue.
Going external.
Check that field
to the west.
Jack, you believe this shit?
Stop. Stop, you're gonna
fuck it up even more.
All right. You ready?
One, two, three.
Jack, Jack.
I tried, man.
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.
Let's get you out.
Let's get you out.
Get me up.
Can you walk?
Yeah. Help me out.
Help me out.
I'm coming!
Dave, Dave, hey, I'm on your side.
Don't shoot me.
TIG: It's okay, It's okay.
I got it, I got it!
I'll be right back. Yeah.
I want to live.
Yeah. I'm coming right back.
Don't!
My pistol,
I need my pistol.
Give me my pistol.
Okay.
Here we go. Here we go.
Men are on the way, all right?
Hang in. Hang in.
JACK: Glen. Glen.
God, watch over him.
Guide him where
he needs to be.
Take care of
his family.
OZ: Chief.
Dave's hurt really bad.
Get somebody up
there to see him.
Rone, we need you in medical immediately.
Over.
CHIEF:
Rone's not
with us anymore.
Oz, how can I help?
Get me to medical.
TIG: Dave's gonna bleed out
fast if you don't get up here.
I'm gonna need
some tourniquets.
SONA: Clear that table
back there.
Put pressure
on that wound.
Get me naked.
Check for bleeds.
Okay.
Trauma sheers,
top shelf on the right.
Hey, hey, hey.
Careful, careful, careful.
I don't want to
get stabbed, too.
What are you doing?
No! No, no, no!
Hey! It's not the time!
The enemy is
still out there!
Let's go!
I called for
air support.
It never came.
GRS JOOST: Show it to me.
I lost the Ambo, man.
GRS JOOST: Are you
allergic to morphine?
I lost the Ambo, Dave.
What do I do?
Shut up and go get
a gun on that door.
Now!
KRIS: You hear that, Boon?
You hear trucks?
Chief.
Are we expecting
any friendlies?
I got 40, 50 vehicles,
including technicals.
I don't know.
KRIS: It's over, guys.
It's fucking over.
A fucking massive
heavy force.
Cock it, cock it.
As far as I'm concerned,
this isn't over till it ends.
That's when they're
all dead or we are.
Oh, Lord! Oh, Jesus!
Guys, I think they're with us.
They're with us!
Oh!
Move, move!
ALEC: It's not safe
out here. Keep going.
SONA: Hurry! Get in the trucks!
They could still be coming.
Come on, guys,
get in the trucks.
Come on. It's not safe out here.
Come on. Let's go.
Up, up, up!
Please, please, please.
ALEC: Come on, guys!
Chief, it's time.
No, I'm staying.
Sir, this is
the last ride out.
Yeah, I know. I'm staying.
I've got intel to collect.
Okay. Let's go!
What's the hold-up?
Your Chief,
he won't exfil!
KRIS: It's not
safe out here!
You what?
I've got work to do.
I'm staying.
For what?
So that more guys like Ty and
Glen have to come back here?
And save your ass again?
You're done here.
Now, get in the fucking car!
KRIS: Amahl.
We made it, man.
Come on,
get in the truck.
I'm going home.
What?
I'm so sorry.
This should never have happened.
Hey.
Your country's got to figure
this shit out, Amahl.
I walked into this country,
I'm walking out.
Thank you.
I don't know how
you survived all that.
But I know how
the rest of us did.
You guys did well tonight.
I'm proud to know
Americans like you.
Couple more hours
till our plane.
Ambassador's body's
just about here.
Hi, sir.
Can I have car?
Yeah.
There's no way.
No way those mortars
found us by chance.
Had to be set up on us
days or weeks ago.
Listen.
Any other six guys,
I don't think we'd make it.
I think we were meant
to be together last night.
How do you think
the Chief's eval is gonna go?
He's going to get
a medal. You'll see.
BOON: And the Deltas?
Yep. Medals.
All of them.
TIG: And what about us?
The odds were
What do we get?
We get to go home.
KRIS: Libyan transport.
Still no Americans.
JACK: Hey.
It's me.
I wanted you to hear it
from me first. We had a...
A problem here.
Whatever you hear
on the news, it's over now.
I'm done.
I'm coming home.
For good.
No.
No, I'm just lucky. I...
I'm just lucky.
He didn't make it.
Rone's not coming home.
I love you so much.
TYRONE: "All the gods, all the heavens,
all the hells are within you."
JACK:
TYRONE: Something Boon
dropped on me earlier.
It's just been rattling
around in my head all night.
