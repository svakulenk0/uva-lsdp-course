If you can't run, you're dead.
You're dead. So you run.
Bullets flying every which way, you
are dodging the exploding shells.
You think, ''Where's God? Where are
all these angels they talk about?''
You're thinking about your mother
and you're thinking about...
your home address,
a cigarette, about nonsense.
Our work is about ugliness,
idiocy and human nature.
About hatred.
So, when you're in a situation when
you think you're going to die...
'cause it's natural to think about
something beautiful in life, right?
There are two types of people
in this world.
Those who have been to war,
who have seen war up close...
and those who haven't.
It's not the same animal.
...
Cesar, if you don't understand,
you have to ask your teacher.
Yes, but it's hard to.
She's always busy.
You need a lot of courage
to talk to the teacher.
So, are we done yet?
-I'm done.
-Done done, or ''kinda sorta'' done?
Done, done.
What's the surprise?
Daddy?
Is it Daddy?
Daddy! Daddy!
Cesar. Cesar.
Come on, come on.
Hi, sweetheart!
I'm sparkling done!
Hey, you little man.
Come here!
It's good to see you!
Come on, get your brother!
Get your brother!
Let me see you.
Love you!
Have a great day!
-What's happened here, Freddy?
-Nothing. It was last night.
They robbed the register.
The fourth time.
-What will it be? Juice oranges?
-Were they armed?
A pretty lady like you doesn't have
to worry about things like that.
...
.
...
...
.
...
...
...
Harrison!
Harrison?
Harrison?
Sweetheart.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Oh, God, that's good.
-I'm going to be late.
-No, no. Don't worry.
I'll make out right with Brubeck.
He knows how it is.
Don't you dare say
anything to Bru...
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
Good morning!
-Good morning.
-Good morning!
God! You look exhausted.
No really, you got the flu?
Gotta a problem this morning?
Excuse me.
Oh, my God, you look terrible.
Are you coming down with something?
You look awful,
maybe you should've called in sick!
How are you doing?
Did Harrison get back to you?
Give me a break!
I had to get out there.
That world wasn't for me.
I came back here to the farm
and I got no regrets.
.
...
,
.
From South Sudan, fresh off
the plane. Shot two days ago.
He once wrote, ''They're all insane''.
And I thought,
''This guy is freaking out!''
.
.
.
-Margaux, Sam.
-Margaux.
Just 'had' to recite her
multiplication tables. Twos.
I had fifteen phones ringing off
the hook and she's there...
''One times two is two,
two times two is four.''
You've made some progress
in Math, Sam!
David's pictures aren't bad.
Take a peek when you get upstairs.
A little lacking in the impact
department, as usual, but not bad.
-Want a beer?
-No.
-I'm giving it up, Sam.
-What, beer?
That's why I wanted to see you.
Right away?
Why?
You'd be bored shitless, Harrison.
-You gave it up.
-I didn't have your talent.
-Why now?
-Sam, my luck bank is down to zero.
Never used to get clammy hands with
guys going at each other around me.
I took my pictures clear-headed,
even when I was up to neck in shit.
And I was proud. The more it stank,
the more dangerous it was...
I was proud to expose it. I was
conscious of doing my job right.
-I wasn't afraid of anything.
-So?
Sam, all I can think about now is
Sarah and the kids.
-And I'm sick of it.
-Yes, I'm sick of it, too.
What the hell do you think?
Every damn day I'm sick of it.
But we can't just drop it.
You can't and I can't.
There is a magazine,
for Christ sake...
Look.
Hang on a while.
Just a little while.
Give me time to get organized.
Then I'll find you something safe,
cushy and overpaid.
Okay, Sam.
I'll stick it out for a while.
But this is just for you. And
I'm warning you it's not for long.
No, no. Not for long.
Not for long.
Anyway,
you're under contract, remember?
You really are a bastard!
-Daddy, watch this!
-Watch what?
-My submarine, please, just once!
-I'm going to be late, pumpkin.
I'm going to be late.
I can't, I'm sorry.
-Please, daddy, please just once!
-Just once. Just once.
Please!
What are you going to do?
Where did you go?
Come here!
You are the best submarine
in the whole world.
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.
-What is it, Harrison?
-Nothing.
Just Cesar.
I don't know. I can't...
Every time I start talking to him
and he clams up.
-I can't figure out why.
-Because you're always away.
-He's not used to having you...
-What's that supposed mean?
Nothing. I want us to have a good
time tonight. I don't want...
No, tell me. What does that mean?
What does that mean?!
-If you showed a little interest...
-Shit! I show interest in him...
in you! In Margaux!
How do you think I spend my time?
Sarah, shit!
Why do you think I do what I do?
For who? It's...
-Oh, shit!
-Saying ''shit'' forty times...
isn't going to help you with your
relationship with your son. Shit!
This student, alone...
has become the symbol for
the forces of freedom...
facing the forces of tyranny.
Television stations from all over
the world covered this event...
but is this image,
this single photography...
which has become synonymous with
the drama of that historic moment.
Yeager Pollack was the man who
captured that magic moment for us.
Wait for it.
Wait for it!
And here tonight,
to introduce him...
his friend and colleague,
Pulitzer Prize winner himself, 1 989...
Newsweek's Harrison Lloyd.
There are very few things that we
can be absolutely certain of...
and never call into question...
no matter how many lives
we live.
And it is my pleasure,
my supreme pleasure...
my honor, and...
to share one of those certainties
with you tonight:
and that is that Yeager Pollack
is the best among us.
Hey, buddy.
Thank you.
I love your shoes.
Thank you, thank you.
I've made a lot of mistakes...
in my life, but I think
the biggest mistake I've made...
was being born in he era
of Harrison Lloyd.
Look up!
All my life, we've been in constant
competition...
over just about everything. So when
I heard that he got this prize...
I said to myself,
''I got to get this too.'' So...
but seriously, I...
this prize means a lot to me...
because he gave it to me.
And that his work taught me that...
photographs can prize the
communal memory of our time...
And...
I go by that.
Thank you very much.
It's a gift that his work...
Thank you.
We divorced about two
or three years later.
Yeager wasn't made for marriage.
He was made to do his job.
No, I mean... it was no secret.
He was in love with Sarah.
,
.
.
...
Yeah.
Yeah, I think somewhere Yeager
wanted Harrison dead.
-I heard your voice up there...
-Excuse me, I've got to take a leak.
No, no. Wait a second...
-He's taking off.
-Darling, you have nice ears.
We're having a little get together
for Yeager at Katzman's...
...and I'd love for you to come.
-I don't think I could make it.
I'm counting on you, even though
you don't like old war stories.
Thanks, Sarah.
-Nice speech, Harrison.
-Thank you, sir.
Nice speech.
''Do you know how many guys
died in Bogota..
so you could powder
you nose, Kyle?''
Did I say anything?
Not anything.
I know a guy who died, Lloyd.
Yesterday.
My friend Leroy got bumped off
in Yugoslavia.
I know, I heard.
And no one gives a shit
about that, right?
'Cause Leroy was a tiny
little photographer...
Tiny.
In a tiny little country,
taking pictures of a tiny little war.
You, you're up there...
you're fancy, you and the others.
Life, Time, Newsweek.
You guys, you travel first class...
with twenty-five cameras...
and your fancy little
hotel rooms...
and then you give
each other prizes.
Don't fucking touch me!
Don't touch me.
Leroy was twenty-five, Harrison.
He was broke.
Remember what that's like?
-I do.
-You do?
Yet no one gave him an assignment.
So he spent his own money...
he put everything he had into
making something for himself...
and still no one would use
his fucking pictures...
and now he's fucking dead
on his own nickel!
-I'm sorry, Kyle...
-Yeah, you're sorry...
...but it happens, okay?
So just calm down, all right?
-Go fuck yourself!
-Come on...
Fuck!
Hey, you want to get funny?
-You wanna get funny?
-Yeager.
I'll fucking break your leg,
come on!
-Harrison?
-Sarah, look. Come here!
Look at this.
Now I know why the only thing
I can shoot in color are flowers.
-And you, of course.
-You must want something.
-Is that from Peter?
-Yep.
Your brother's
a hypocritical son of a bitch.
Going around picking flowers
while people kill each other...
-He should be ashamed of himself.
-He doesn't pick... he saves them.
-And he gets paid good money for it.
-I know.
And the St. Louis Botanical Gardens
is a waste of the taxpayer's money.
I'm kidding.
Your brother's a very wise
man and I envy him.
So what is it?
''Catharanthus roseus''.
Madagascar pink periwinkle.
Never seen one of these before.
It has some therapeutic uses...
cures certain forms of
infantile leukemia.
It's beautiful and a lifesaver.
Just like you.
I was trying to be clever.
-What's the matter?
-No, nothing, nothing. Just...
It's so heavy!
It's so heavy!
Shit! Brubeck has been looking out
for you. Sorry, I completely forgot.
Sam! What's up?
Zagreb, and then...
Where is it? North?
I got it, I got it.
What's happening in Yugoslavia?
Civil war, it's nothing
earth-shattering.
No TV crews, even on CNN,
they don't have anything.
Brubeck wants me to go there
for the international edition.
Just about a week. You know,
Time is sending somebody.
Sweetheart, can you give me
that map there on the couch?
Yeager's furious he can't go.
He has to have his knee operated on.
Hope it's nothing serious.
-You'll look in on him, right?
-Sure.
-Promise?
-Promise.
Graz. G-R-A-Z.
Make sure there's
an airport there, okay?
Yes, master.
Cesar is going to be
so disappointed.
I promised him you'd be home for
his birthday. You will, won't you?
Hi, Lisa. It's Sarah Lloyd,
I'm calling for Harrison.
Yes, he needs a ticket for Graz.
G-R-A-Z.
Yes, I think they have
an airport.
It's in Australia.
Nope.
Austria!
Austria.
She loves me.
-She loves me not.
-So what time? 2:45 PM.
Lay over in Zurich. Mom's in Zurich.
You have lunch with her.
-She loves me not.
-Okay, thank you.
Good morning, Lisa.
Nice hat, Sarah.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm going to get some coffee.
Do you want some?
Yes, decaf. Skinny! Foam!
Vanilla! The works!
-He pulled the trigger.
-No, he just wanted to scare her.
Scare an old woman?
What for?
Harrison's using a 1 35. Odds are the
guy never saw him take the picture.
I'm sure he pulled the trigger.
Fuck!
...
...
-What's going on?
-First footage out of Yugoslavia.
...
...
.
-Gonna be another Beirut.
-You can't tell.
All we have is Croatian TV.
It's confusing.
Rival militias settling
old scores.
Add a pinch of religion,
cover and let simmer...
...you got yourself a messy war.
-Could spread a full-scale war.
-No, it's just a...
-What? A police action?
No. Just ethnic skirmishes.
The Europeans haven't moved and
it's right in their own backyard.
They know what they're doing,
don't they?
Well...
-What's this?
-Pictures of ''ethnic skirmishes''.

Hello?
Hello?
Harrison?
Harrison?
Hello.
Hello.
Harrison? Harrison?
I can't hear you.
But you can hear me, right?
Yes, I miss you, Harrison Lloyd.
If that's why you're calling.
Actually, all I've done is think
about you for the last few days.
You know, I've had these dreams.
You know, those dreams.
Your hands, your mouth!
It's very frustrating, you know!
You're laughing at me.
You know,
I've thought about it, Harrison...
when I turn on the TV
I wish I could watch CNN...
and feel like it doesn't affect
me personally.
You can hear me, I hope.
You know? You could...
Hello?
Hello?
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
Good morning.
-Is there anything for me, Lisa?
-Nothing.
Sarah.
Sarah...
Sarah, wait.
Sarah, please.
Sarah, I must..
Sarah!
-Sarah, sweetheart!
-Don't say it.
Please. Just...
don't say it.
The Red Cross sent word yesterday.
We were waiting to be sure
before we told you.
ZDF confirmed.
They lost a cameraman
and a reporter too.
Drink this, it'll do you good.
Where?
Some small town.
I don't know.
Near Osijek.
When do they bring his body back?
Well, it won't be right away.
They won't bring him back.
He was...
in this house and it collapsed.
And they buried everyone right away
to protect against epidemics.
They're sending his backpack
with some of his cameras.
He went light,
dropped most of his gear off...
with one of our guys in Zagreb.
I won't see him again?
I won't see him...
It's a filthy fucking war, Sarah.
Just like all the other
filthy fucking wars.
We were wrong.
It's not just skirmishes.
We were all wrong.
I'll take you home.
Sarah, I'll take you home.
I'll take you home.
Come on, I'm taking you home.
Sarah.
She made me promise I wouldn't say
anything to the children.
She said that one thing and
then she didn't talk.
.
.
.
.
...
Sarah, darling!
.
.
.
Then, a few days later, they came
with the bags, Mr. Lloyd's bags.
...
Sarah! Sarah!
.
.
Sarah!
Sarah!
...
.
.
.
...
...
.
.
What is this?
What are you doing?
What are you doing here?
-Saying Kaddish, Sarah.
-But no one is dead.
There's no reason for this.
Where are my children?
Sarah. Sarah, we need closure!
Get your hands off of me!
No one is dead!
He's not dead, Peter! Okay?
Would you just tell them to leave?
He's not dead.
Sarah?
I'm going to take Cesar and Margaux
with me to St. Louis tomorrow.
They'll be...
They'll be with their cousins.
I think they'll be better off.
Is that all right with you?
Hi, Peter.
Hi, you.
Nina will stay here.
Mom wants to stay, too.
If she bothers, you give me a call.
Something would've broken inside
if he were dead.
It's not possible otherwise.
Do you understand, Peter?
Yes, you understand.
Do what you have to do.
Take your time.
When you decide...
I'll bring the kids back or you
can come to Saint Louis, all right?
Thank you.
Sarah.
You have two beautiful children.

I'm going to bring him back, Cesar.
Okay.
You take care of Margaux.
I love you.
I love you.
So, please, you take everything
and then sign over there.
-You are a journalist?
-No.
-You not going to Yugoslavia, yes?
-No.
Where are you going?
-I have business in Graz.
-Fine.
Because we had cars returned
with holes in them.
-One gave us just the keys back.
-No kidding.
Here, the car is outside.
There.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
-Sorry, can you bring me?
-You going to Graz?
No, bring me where you go.
Please. Please.
-I don't understand.
-You go where?
Go where?
-To Vukovar.
-I know road.
I show if you bring me.
Please.
I'll help you.
Really, please.
I'm a student in Paris.
But I'm Croatian.
I go to find family.
Wife and baby.
My baby five months.
I have a picture to show you.
-She's beautiful!
-Thank you.
I want bring them with me in France,
in Montpellier.
-Have you children?
-Yes, two.
Cesar and Margaux.
What is it?
Frontier. Always line.
Stop! Stop here.
Stop here.
-Okay.
-Should I go?
It think it's okay.
.
The only soldiers she'd ever seen
were in movies or photographs...
like everybody else, I suppose.
No, she didn't know the first thing
I don't think, not even that...
you could have fighting to
the dead in a certain zone...
and then a few hundred yards down
the road, life goes on as usual.
We go first to Nasice, okay?
We see war situation.
-Your name?
-Sarah.
-Pretty.
-Thank you.
My name is Chtiomac.
-Stomach?
-No.
No stomach.
Chtiomac.
-Thought that's what I said.
-No, you said stomach.
Stomach it's like tummy!
-Say it, ''Chtiomac''.
-Chtiomac.
It's good.
So, what do you study in Paris?
I want to be teacher.
French teacher in Croatia.
Vukovar is very far and dangerous.
We pass Osijek.
Chetniks! Chetniks!
Come on! Come on!
Press! Press!
Please, please.
He's not a soldier. Please!
Please!
Please! Please!
Please!
Please, please, please...
It got nasty out here.
I don't like it here.
Why?
It's so nice and quiet.
Hey, she's alive!
She's lucky,
they didn't have time to rape her.
Come on, come on.
Serbian? Croatian?
Please, say something.
We're going to bring you back
to Osijek, okay?
-You understand me?
-They killed him.
They killed him for no reason.
English? American?
What are you doing her?
-She's a photographer.
-You're a photographer?
Don't shoot! We're photographers!
Don't shoot!
Please, go! Go!
I was shitting bricks there,
to be honest.
For the first time
in my career really.
I mean, I'd covered
a dozen wars already...
and I like this...
but there, it was... bad.
I saw snipers shooting down kids,
then scratching marks on the wall.
Here we are.
No problem finding a room.
Tourism is not exactly
booming right now.
You'll like it here.
River view suite, a cozy bar...
got one star in it.
-Where have you been this evening?
-Went to an opening.
Oh, yeah?
Big production?
Crucified snipers,
corpse compacting, the works.
No bar at that party though.
I'd kill for a fucking drink.
-Me too.
-Do you have a beer?
I'll order something for you, Kyle?
Sarah, it's you!
You're out of your fucking mind?
You're out of your fucking mind?
Are you out of your fucking mind!?
-What's the problem?
-You're out of your fucking mind?
You already said that, didn't you?
-Do you know her?
-Where the fuck did you find her?
Near her car.
There was another guy with her.
-He's dead.
-Who is she then? Do you know her?
Well, come on.
Who the hell is she already?
Sarah Lloyd.
I'm going to Vukovar.
I'm not going to Zagreb.
Not in your wildest
fucking dreams!
Sarah, you can't stay
in this country.
This country is...
No one knows what
this country is!
So you'd better beat it
out of here and fast!
I didn't ask for anybody's help.
I have a press card, just...
They don't give a shit
about press cards...
or white flags, or their
own fucking mothers!
Listen, Serb, Catholic,
Croatian, Orthodox...
there's no bad guys,
there's no good guys.
They're going to shoot you first
and then they'll think about it.
This is no place for you.
This is no place for the living,
all right?
-They are fucking insane!
-Calm down, Kyle.
You tell her!
You can't go into Vukovar.
The Serbs control the roads.
They bomb everything.
We can't,
even if we wanted to, we can't.
-And Sarah, Harrison is...
-Harrison is there...
and I'm going to get him.
He called me. After the date
they said he was dead!
And if you could just tell me
where Osijek is...
and Vincovci, Nustar,
and Vukovar...
I'm going to go to the hospital
in Vukovar, and after that...
Excuse me, are you deaf?
Or you're just not listening?
It's impossible. You think you'd
arrive at the airport and call for a taxi?
''Take me to Vukovar, please.''
This is a war we have here.
Real war with real blood...
real death, real bombs,
mines, bullets.
With real pricks who'd love
to cut your stomach out.
War.
Didn't your husband
ever mention it?
Here, here. Take this.
It'll relax you.
-This woman is a lunatic.
-This is a sucker, isn't it?
Everybody up.
Come on, we've got work to do.
No, it's across the street,
the Croatian TV building.
Who gives what they're shelling?
They're shelling! Let's go!
They're behind us!
Behind us.
On the other side of the river.
Look! Look! See the shell's fire?
I'm moving up.
I'm moving with you.
What's this all about?
Harrison is alive?
Yep, so is Elvis. I saw that fucking
building blow up! I was there.
-You saw him dead?
-The house went down!
But what about that phone call?
-You all right?
-Yeah.
If you know something,
please tell her, Kyle. Please!
I made the call! I made the call,
I wanted to tell her.
She couldn't hear me at the other
end of the line.
-She couldn't hear me.
-They're hitting the hotel!
Sarah!
-You get her...
-Sarah!
Sarah! Sarah!
Get the fuck out!
Get up. Get up.
You can't be afraid, let's go.
Let's go, please. Go.
Come on.
-Let me go! Let me go!
-Sarah!
Come on!
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Sarah?
Come on, get out of here.
Let's go or we'll die!
Get outside!
Get outside!
Hide in the basement.
Shit! We're never gonna get down
to that cellar. It's full up!
We're gonna be stuck in there
like mice in a fucking trap!
Don't they have a
bloody wine cellar?
-This isn't a French restaurant!
-Let's get the fuck out of here!
We got nurse!
Fuck!
Shit! Shit!
Fuck!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
-Get in the fucking car!
-Animals!
Get in, get in!
-Get in! Get in!
-My fucking car!
Shit!
I'll be on the Avis
shit list for sure!
Three cars these assholes totaled.
Where you're going?
-Morris!
-We are going to Vukovar.
-You're out of your mind!
-We're going to Vukovar.
Calm down.
I've got an errand
to run for this lady.
He must have tried
to cross through Osijek.
And then he tried
to follow the Serbs...
to get as close as
he could to Vukovar.
Or else he went by way
of Vincovsci.
What would you have done if the
Serbs had closed off the roads?
He would've gone to Vukovar. That's
where we have to go to get the shot.
Right.
And once you're in Vukovar,
can you contact anyone outside?
-And if he is injured...
-Checkpoint.
-Here. It's loaded.
-Blink your headlights.
-You're a photographer, remember.
-Jumpy bunch of little brats.
Slow it up, will you?
Got anything white?
-No.
-Have you?
Slow it fucking up!
How many times did I tell you?
-Right down, right down.
-Shut up, shut up.
They're fucking mad!
Don't say a word to them. Don't...
...are you listening to me?
-Cool it.
Shit!
Press. Press.
How you doing?
Smoke?
-You speak English?
-So-so.
-So... what's new?
-The war.
Exactly!
Who holds the city?
-Who holds it?
-We took west side...
from the Bokan militia.
East side is still fighting
but we hold.
-The Chetniks have all the rest.
-This road over here, is it safe?
One kilometer, Serb snipers.
After, I don't know. But they'll
attack, probably tonight.
Kyle, the Chetniks
have all the rest.
Risk your own neck, not mine.
Please, please.
I'm looking for this man.
Have you seen this man?
Photographer. American.
He was here taking pictures.
Have you seen this man?
Let her be, Kyle. Let's go to
Graz, put her in a plane...
and the hell with it.
Lloyd's dead, you know he is.
Everybody fucking knows he is.
Did you see his body?
Did you?
No, okay?
I didn't see anything, so...
if she thinks he's alive,
then maybe he is alive.
-Cut the bullshit, Kyle.
-I'm not bullshitting!
You can't fucking go there.
Why are you doing this?
Look around.
Because If you see that
they're killing everybody...
every fucking way you look...
than it doesn't matter if I'm in
Vukovar or somewhere else.
Who gives a shit?
Why are you taking her?
Stevenson...
get off my case, all right?
Or go home to mummy.
Shit. I'd love to see my mummy.
Look at her.
I tell you what,
you go over there and you say:
''Sarah, there's really no use hoping
'cause your husband's dead.''
Go ahead, Marc.
You do it if you got the balls.
I don't.
Please. I'm looking for this man.
Have you seen this man in the area?
He takes pictures.
It's an American photographer.
He could be injured. No?
Please, have you seen this man?
You're out of film.
Picturesque, huh?
They're lucky, you know,
they still have their eyes.
You know what they say?
They say certain Chetnik extremists
when they come to town...
not only do they torture
and kill everybody...
they cut out their eyes
to keep score.
You want to make this trip?
Are you sure?
-Well?
-No way.
They can't warn the snipers.
He says they'll see the
TV sing on the window.
There's always hope.
That's the first quarter mile.
-Fantastic.
-After that, they don't know.
After that, if we're still alive,
it's Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.
Put your hand on the door handle.
You hear one shot...
you hit the door and go down
in the ditch. Ready, Marc?
Come on.
Step on it. Let's go.
I think we made it.
Shit! Don't jump. Don't jump.
Hang on. Hang on.
Get inside!
Get up! Get up!
Get inside!
Sarah!
God! Help me!
Put the head up!
There's nothing we can do.
-What she's saying?
-She's praying.
What the fuck is that?
It's tanks.
Oh shit!
Shit! My car!
They are fucking destroying my car!
Get down!
Get over to the wall! Come on!
Get away from the window, Marc.
Get away from the fucking window!
-I'm shaking like a fucking leaf.
-Get behind the fucking wall!
Fuck it!
-Shit!
-We're fucking dead.
White House, some analysis...
Nelson? What is it?
-What?
-Look at the name, sir.
Excuse-me
Yes, yes. What is it?
There is no note?
-Nothing?
-No.
Well, yes, there was,
but very short.
No, everything's fine...
You know, nothing in particular.
No, no, it's quiet there now.
Yeah, relatively quiet.
It's removed from the fighting.
Yes, yes, I know,
but there's no use worrying.
All right, thank you.
How long did it take
for the film to get through?
Three days.
It's getting worse and worse.
Kyle Morris.
Who's he shooting for?
A.F.P.
-Did you call Simon?
-Yes, right away.
They don't know anything.
Just film they get
from time to time.
It looks like Morris left
this town called Binkowski...
and followed the Serbian offensive.
Since then...
He sent his film along with Sarah's,
that's all we know.
-She's looking for Harrison.
-Oh, great! Give the man a cigar.
She's off her rocket,
for God's sake!
Look, look here.
-They're good pictures, though.
-Look at this.
No, there!
The children are
so beautiful here.
I'd love to put them in the
back and take them somewhere else.
Yeah, we should've bought the bus.
Hang on, we're in trouble here.
They're going to the front. Marc,
put a hook in their ass, come on!
-Get out of the street.
-There's Vukovar. To the right!
Now we're gonna get there.
Now we're gonna get there.
-How many miles?
-About fifteen.
But between the checkpoints and the
mines, it'll take us about 3 hours.
We're going to waltz right
through this, right through!
Maybe the last waltz.
Go right! Go right!
Oh, Christ.
Now, where we go?
-What's this?
-Hold on! Hold on!
What's this?
Hang on, hang on!
Fucking mess!
Got to get the fuck out of here,
guys! Fucking Serbs are coming!
-The shit is gonna fly!
-Where you coming from?
The road from Vukovar.
We couldn't get through.
It's a goddamn bloodbath! They
are killing anything that moves.
A fucking conversation?
Move it, move it!
-Didn't you hear what I just said?
-Kyle, maybe he's right.
Get back in the fucking car!
We're going to Vukovar.
-Move the fucking car.
-He's coming from Vukovar!
You listen to your girlfriend.
It's crawling with death back there!
We've got go in a convoy. We gotta
move to the border all the way...
...to the back, in a convoy!
-We're going to Vukovar, understand?
And you are one dead asshole.
Thanks a lot! Have a nice life.
Be safe.
Get back in the car. You want to
take a rip back with this guy?
You want to get a nice hot bath
in Zagreb?
I understand, stay. Why don't
you grab your bag and stay!
And let you get shot, I don't care.
You're joking me?
That's good,
that's what I want to hear.
-Fuck!
-Help me push it out.
All right, go!
Yeah, I see you.
Very funny. Fuck you too.
Shit! Christ!
It's a fucking inferno.
I'm not gonna stand this.
Come on, we gotta go.
-Where are we going?
-There's a basement over here.
Shit!
Get up.
Come on, Marc.
You okay?
I'm scared too.
We're all scared.
I really don't like dead bodies.
They know that our photos are going
to tell the story of this war.
You understand that?
They know that's why we're here.
Alright? If we don't take them,
nobody will.
They want us to do what we do.
Maybe I can wake up some guy who's
yelling about a parking ticket!
Show him there are better
things to be upset about.
It's good work your husband does,
you know? Really good.
Why are you doing this?
Doing what? This?
This is for me. 'Cause I haven't
done anything with my life...
and I've always wanted to be
a boy scout.
Just needed an opportunity.
You want to sleep or you want to
stick it out, 'cause I've got...
Phenobarbitol and
I've got Benzedrine.
Come on! Look. If there's even an
excuse to do drugs...
you're looking at it.
Besides, when you sleep,
you forget about food.
And I'm starving!
Are you hungry?
-Yes.
-Well, there's your dinner.
Harrison and I got into a fight
the night of the Pulitzer.
I know.
-He told you about it?
-Yes.
Well, I feel bad about it now.
I mean... just stupid.
Don't worry about it,
I'll explain it to him.
Good night.
You think he's dead, right?
Are you kidding?
Harrison's immortal.
Gentleman!
Dumb and dumber, huh?
You're blind as well as ignorant.
Look at them.
I knew you guys were here.
I saw your car outside.
Sorry, you got a parking ticket.
I tried to stop her...
but it was too late.
It had already started to rain.
'Evening, ma'am.
Nice to see you again.
Still kicking around
our neck of the woods?
Sure am.
Where's Cathy?
Died.
Yesterday.
Took a sniper's bullet...
right in the head.
Never felt a thing.
Where?
On the road to Vukovar.
Look at this.
Shit!
Shit!
Shit.
Put this on your face
for the stink.
It's that girl in the yellow
dress.
They fucking raped her!
Fucking raped her!
Are you okay?
Come on. Come on!
-Slow it up!
-All right, all right.
What is this?
-Slow it.
-All right, all right.
Jesus. What the fuck is that?
-Press.
-Press.
-Come on, buddy.
-God Almighty!
Come on, guys.
Ever get the feeling
you're not welcome?
They're freaking out. They lose
Vukovar, they lose the war.
They lose the war, they're dead.
Oh, God!
Look at that dog.
Look!
Park it up. Looks like
someone got here before us.
Look at that!
Yeager, fuck face, Pollack!
Don't tell me this war
has gone prime time.
It's a miracle you're still alive.
So let's praise God and thank the
Lord and let's get back to Zagred.
-Doesn't anyone thank me?
-Thanks, Kyle.
Yeah. For?
-For taking care of Sarah.
-That's right.
-For taking care of Sarah.
-That's much nicer, you see?
''Thanks, Morris, for taking care
of Sarah Lloyd.''
-Polite and nice.
-What I am not saying?
That's not enough?
-So now what? Vukovar is out?
-That's right!
-Can you let her speak for herself?
-Asshole!
There are Serbian snipers
not a hundred yards away.
They are shooting fish in a barrel.
You can't get through.
What do you think the Croatians are
getting ready for?
A party?
Doesn't that give you some inkling
about what's going to happen here?
I'm going anyway.
You can't get in to Vukocar, man.
Nobody gets in nobody gets out!
All you can do in Vukovar is die.
What the fuck do you know?
Jumping out of an airplane.
What you're fucking looking at me
for? I'm trying to help you, guys!
-What is this with you?
-I got photos to take.
You got photos to take! Take them!
Nobody is telling you not to take!
-That's enough!
-You don't have to take her!
-It's enough.
-I'm going, Yeager. I have to go.
If there's half a chance he's
in that hospital. I have to go.
He's dead!
He's dead, Sarah! Please!
Sarah!
You'll run out of film, Stevenson.
What you're doing here, anyway?
Get on with your life,
write a book or something!
-Write a book!
-Well...
I know why you are here.
I know you came for her...
but you're not going to change her
mind from doing what she needs to do.
Not unless you show her
Harrison's body. So...
do what I do. All right?
Help her.
We better both pray that some day
we find somebody...
that loves us the way
she loves him.
Understand?
There was this mercenary,
this Frenchman guy...
Fuck!
He saw a guy, an American
photographer, about 6, 8 days ago.
The Frenchman said he looked
pretty bad, but he was alive...
but he might be in there,
in that hospital.
Well, next stop, Vukovar!
.
We were exhausted. The fear was
eating through us at that stage.
We knew the horror that was...
waiting for us.
If she had hesitated for one
second, we would've turned back.
She didn't hesitate.
So, we got ready.
We leave at ten-second intervals.
The highway should be about 3/ 4
of a mile behind that wooded area.
We run for one minute,
stop for one minute, then go again.
Any shooting, we stop and count
again from zero.
Any one of us catches up
with anyone else, we wait to...
re-establish the distance. Anybody
gets wounded, no going backwards.
The next one will take care
of it, okay?
What if the last one
gets wounded?
You go first.
Then Kyle, then Sarah.
I'll bring up the rear.
-I'll go first.
-Sarah, please.
-Okay, Stevenson?
-Okay.
Go. Anytime you're ready.
Go. Go.
Sarah!
-Where are we?
-Okay, listen.
You gotta take this off.
Take this off.
You're all right?
Smile. Stay cool.
They can't get over us making
it past their snipers.
They admire strength, they hate
weakness. Keep your chin up!
They think we're fabulous.
Your leg is bad?
It's okay.
Will they let us through?
Whatever's going on the other side
they don't want any witness.
Relax. Put a smile on your face.
They love us.
They think we're
hilariously funny.
See that big guy there?
Say hi to the big guy.
Nobody's made it through before us.
What do we do?
-Walk. Walk.
-Thank you.
-They know where the hospital is?
-We'll find it, we'll find it.
Listen! Listen!
-It's time to go back to Zagreb.
-It's so stupid it might work.
Don't turn around!
Don't turn around!
You want a photo?
Keep walking!
...
then we were in the streets
of Vukovar.
.
.
.
.
.
.
And I asked myself,
''What are we doing here?''
Get back,
get back.
Bastards!
They're bastards!
You bastards!
.
.
Photographers!
Photographers!
That's the fucking hospital.
Come on, come on.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Go! Go! Go!
Come on, Marc.
Over here.
Get inside!
The fucking Arkan guys!
Man! They're crazy!
Marc!
Marc, get over here!
Come on, come on!
Fuck! Fuck!
-Come on.
-I don't want to be here.
-I don't want to stay here.
-Come on.
My bag! My bag!
I don't wanna go.
-It smells! It stinks of death!
-Take it easy, Marc.
No, no. We gotta go!
We can't stay here.
-You can't go out there!
-We can't!
Stay put!
Just listen to me!
They're going to kill us.
I'm begging you, Kyle.
Please. I got to go now!
Get your hands off me!
Stay over here!
-You can't go out!
-Get off!
Hang in there.
Look at me.
You're looking for a dead man?
There's thousands of them!
I know, I know.
Marc, come on.
It's all right. Look, they're gone.
They're gone, Marc.
Kyle! Kyle!
I got you! I got you!
I got you. Don't worry.
You're gonna be all right. Come on.
Come on!
Come on, I got you.
Going to be all right.
Shit.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Shit!
It's almost nightfall.
If the Serbs attack, they are
going to hit the hospital first.
It there's any hope in getting
Harrison, we got to move now.
And we'll come back...
This is what we came for, right?
God-damn it.
All right, all right.
We better get going.
All right, all right!
I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
Come on, come on.
God-damn it.
This way.
We can't, Sarah. It's too late.
We got to get to shelter! Come on!
Marc, shelter!
Sarah!
Sarah!
I'm looking for an American man.
-Help me!
-Take a photo!
They must know!
They must know!
Harrison!
Harrison!
Harrison!
Harrison! Harrison!
It's me, Sarah!
Harrison. My God!
My God, Harrison.
Harrison.
It's me, Sarah.
It's me, Sarah.
Harrison.
What's wrong with you?
Harrison!
Come on!
Come on!
.
He was suffering from what they
call ''bomb blast effect''.
It's trauma caused by a bomb
exploding in close proximity.
.
.
.
.
.
...
Sarah would give him little
pieces of bread dipped in water...
.
.
,
.
...
.
...
.
November the 1 8th, 1 991 ,
silence was restored.
Ever since that day
I've known that peace is silence.
...
.
.
.
,
...
.
Come on, it's all right.
It's okay.
Cesar is enormous.
They change so much
at this age.
He's...
In the last few months...
he's become a young man.
I think I did the right thing by not
bringing the kids to the hospital.
I didn't want them to see you.
I mean, when you weren't well,
you know...
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Hi, daddy.
Okay. Margaux.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.
Watch this, daddy.
Daddy? Watch this.
I'm going to do the submarine.
Daddy?
Come here.
Sit down. Sit down!
Sit down.
Sit down.
I'm going to do the submarine.
I took care of your flowers.
Not one of them got ruined.
I'm going to do some work.
I'm going to do
the submarine again.
Harrison?
Harrison!
Sarah.
Hi, Sarah.
Cesar took care of the flowers.
All this time, he told me he took
care of the flowers.
My little boy took care
of the flowers.
What happened to me?
