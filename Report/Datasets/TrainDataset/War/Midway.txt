Admiral Yamamoto, please.
He asked not to be disturbed.
- lt is most urgent.
Admiral Yamamoto?
Tokyo has been bombed.
- When?
and Yokosuka were also bombed.
His lmperial Majesty is unharmed.
l personally phoned the palace.
Damage? - Very little to Tokyo.
No reports from the other cities,
but it seems probable
that they too were barely scratched.
How did they do it, Watanabe?
They launched long-range
B-25 bombers from their carriers.
They came in at treetop level,
and were first seen over the city.
Tokyo ... bombed!
Sir, l understand your concern
for the Emperor's safety, but ...
You may speak freely, Commander.
- This raid is a blessing in disguise.
The Americans have
proven you correct.
Dur homeland is not invulnerable.
After today, the General Staff
will certainly approve
your operation M-l.
Lieutenant-Colonel Doolittle
led the raid with a force of 16 B-25s
and an all-volunteer crew of airmen.
Most of the planes carried
and single incendiary clusters,
which were dropped on oil stores,
factories and military sites in Tokyo.
A few planes made minor strikes
on Kobe, Yokohama and Nagoya,
with one bomb hitting
the Japanese carrier Ryuko.
News of this raid has improved
American and allied morale,
while at the same time constituting
a blow to Japanese prestige.
Thanks, Sir.
At his press conference today,
President Roosevelt was asked:
''Can you tell us, where did
those planes start from and go to?''
He replied:
''Yes, the time has come to tell you.
They came from our new
secret base at Shangri-la ...''
Well, my God, it's Captain Garth!
l was expecting some junior officer.
This is an unexpected honor!
Yeah, like hell it is, Joe!
Admiral Nimitz sent me over to ...
- To chew my ass off, huh?
Dfficially, l'm supposed to question
your estimate of Japanese intentions.
Why so grim, Matt? Doolittle's attack
should've thrilled you CinCPAC people.
Not by a long shot.
That damn raid could boomerang on us.
We only got 4 carriers
in the Pacific. We need to rebuild.
Now the boss is afraid Yamamoto's
going to jump back at us. But where?
We got the latest intercepts here.
Here's a list of Japanese ships
we suspect will be assigned
to amphib operations south of Rabaul.
The Coral Sea! That's where
we think they'll strike next.
But something else is stirring,
something out our way.
We need facts, not guesswork.
Matt, we cracked Yamamoto's code,
but we can't just reel it off.
We get a flicker here
and a glimmer there.
How much can you decipher?
- Hell, 15, maybe ...
Really decipher.
- Ten percent.
For Christ's sake, you're guessing!
We like to call it ''analysis''.
Alright. What are these indications
that something's brewing out our way?
There's no hard clues yet.
- What do you have, Joe?
lncreased radio traffic between
Yamamoto's commanders. - That's all?
Could be significant. At least
l feel that something's stirring.
Alright,
l'll take that list of Jap ships
you ''feel'' are headed for Coral Sea.
Nimitz may send Fletcher's task force
to see what's going on.
We'll see how your 10-percent
guesswork pays off, huh?
As a back-room code-cracker
l thank you, Matt.
Joe, could l ask you
something very personal? - Certainly.
lt really stinks down here.
How often do your people take a bath?
Bath? God, l don't know ...
What day is it?
Forget it, Joe.
Any new Yamamoto intercepts?
Here's a first mention of ''A-F'',
whatever that means.
A-F?
Captain!
Tom!
Dad ...
My God, Tom.
When did you get in? l didn't know ...
Last night. - This is beautiful. Why
didn't you write that you were coming?
l've been assigned to Kaneohe.
- Well, l'll finally see some of you.
Three years!
You look great, Tom.
- So do you, Dad.
Kaneohe, are you? What squadron?
- VF-8.
You'll like it. Your C.D. used to be
my wing-man on the old Langley.
Could we talk somewhere?
Sure ... Here.
l phoned you from Guam
the day you graduated.
Yeah, l heard later.
l'm sorry l missed the call.
l guess your mother was there?
Yeah.
- How is she?
Recovered from the divorce, l guess.
- That's good.
l was hoping maybe we could ...
- Dad,
l've fallen in love with
a Japanese girl. l want to marry her.
l need your help.
l damn well guess you do, Tiger.
She's been arrested in Honolulu.
How did you manage that?
ln San Diego and getting mixed up
with a Japanese girl in Honolulu?
She was a student in San Diego.
- And she was arrested here?
Her parents live here. She wouldn't
marry me without their permission.
Apparently, the FBl has something
on her folks, so they got picked up.
Well, that figures.
Haruko was born here.
She's as loyal as you or me.
Anyway, the minute l got in l went
to see where they're being held.
She wouldn't see me.
- Why not?
l don't know.
She and her parents will be sent
back to the mainland in a few days.
lt sticks in your throat
that l want to marry a Japanese girl?
Sticks in your ...? Don't give me
that ''racial bigot'' crap.
l don't care what color she is.
- lt's not the point ...
Christ almighty!
Boy, you have lousy timing.
What's her name?
l'll see if l can get her FBl report.
l wrote it down for you:
Haruko Sakura.
But promise one thing:
Don't do anything stupid
till l see what l can get hold of.
That's a deal.
ln my opinion, the plan is not only
unnecessary, but doomed to fail.
Admiral Kondo, Dperation M-l
was conceived by our best strategist.
We are aware of Captain Kuroshima's
authorship and his reputation.
But this time, the god of operations
has conceived a monster.
Would you please explain?
How am l expected to land
my invasion forces on Midway,
unless the enemy airfields and
shore batteries have been neutralized?
Admiral Nagumo has said his carriers
will obliterate the American defenses.
The enemy's land-based bombers
have a range of 400 miles more
than Nagumo's carrier planes.
His ships would be blown out of
the sea before he launches his attack.
l destroyed the US fleet at Hawaii,
where the risk was far greater.
Where were the land-based bombers?
A surprise attack with
a carrier task force is one thing.
But this, a strike
against Midway and the Aleutians
with 200 ships and 100,000 men.
Does the idea of taking the Aleutians
cause you concern, Hosogaya?
No, Sir. But an operation so complex,
l'd like more time to study it.
After all, in a matter of hours
our Coral Sea operation begins.
We have sufficient forces for both.
l tend to agree
with Admirals Kondo and Hosogaya.
l suggest we meet again
after the Coral Sea campaign.
Very well.
- Gentlemen, consider this:
The Americans are still
unprepared and outnumbered.
lf their fleet can be lured
into battle and defeated,
they will have no significant
naval force left in the Pacific.
They will have to sue for peace.
l have traveled widely in America,
my friends.
Their industrial might is awesome.
l'm convinced our only hope of victory
is one massive strike at Midway.
Joe, are you sure this
''hot information'' of yours can't wait?
l already got one thing for the boss.
- l consider this urgent.
And, you were right about Coral Sea.
That's where the Japs were, alright.
Every ship on your list was there.
- Did we get hurt?
We got hurt.
Welcome on, Admiral.
How was your flight?
Long and full of potholes.
Got Fletcher's Coral Sea report?
- Right here, Sir.
Get in back, Joe.
But wait till l cue you in.
Here's Admiral Fletcher's
preliminary report, Sir.
We lost the Lexington.
What about the enemy?
We sank one light carrier, one big
first-line job and some small ships.
Looks like
we just about broke even, Admiral.
We can't trade the Japanese
carrier for carrier, Matt.
We started with a 3 to 1 superiority.
With the Lexington gone,
the Saratoga laid up,
all we've got is the Hornet,
the Enterprise and the Yorktown.
Sir, Yorktown was heavily damaged
at Coral Sea. There's the report.
Admiral, Commander Rochefort
has something urgent, he says.
lt's about objective A-F,
the meaning of ''A-F''.
Dur listening posts pick up traffic
between Yamamoto's flag commanders.
There's been a heavy traffic volume,
with references to object ''A-F'' ...
... and A-D. A-D is a mystery,
maybe a diversion.
But l think we've identified ''A-F''.
lt's Midway.
lt had us stymied until one of my men
remembered an intercept from March.
A Jap reconnaissance pilot radioed
his base that he's close to ''A-F''.
We plotted every course
the plane could have have taken,
and the only appreciable landmass
he could have flown over was Midway.
Joe! - l know it's thin.
- Thin? Damn near invisible!
But l figured out
a way to confirm it, Sir.
lf you have this flown to Midway.
lt's a fake message, Admiral,
reporting that Midway's
freshwater condenser's broken down.
lt should be transmitted in the clear,
so the Japanese get every word.
lnstruct Midway to include this in
their housekeeping traffic tomorrow.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Send this right away.
Hey, chief!
What's this?
There ain't nothin' wrong
with our freshwater condenser!
Dombrowski, send it.
Damn heat's gettin' to everybody here.
Have this intercept coded
and transmitted to fleet headquarters!
They took the bait, Admiral.
Rochefort just decoded a transmission
from Kwajalein
to Yamamoto's headquarters:
''A-F has trouble
with its freshwater condenser.''
''A-F'' has to be Midway lsland.
Be at my office at 05:00, Matt.
l'm calling in the whole staff.
This is how
l expect the battle to develop:
The northern force, under Hosogaya,
strikes the Aleutians as a diversion.
To keep Nimitz's attention
away from our main objective.
He will not realize
our objective is Midway
until 24 hours later, when
Nagumo's carriers strike the island
and destroy the American
planes and shore batteries.
At that hour you move in,
Kondo, with your invasion forces.
Nimitz will be forced to respond.
He'll commit the balance of his fleet,
most certainly his carriers,
to repel the invasion.
His carrier commander
will undoubtedly be Admiral Halsey.
l have studied his tactics
and l have studied the man.
Halsey is courageous,
tough-minded and not afraid of risks,
but we will turn
these strengths against him.
lt will take Halsey's task force
at least 48 hours to reach Midway.
By that time, Nagumo, you'll have
crushed Midway and be waiting for him.
You'll have a better position,
and at least
a 2-to-1 superiority in carriers,
and 4 to 5 times
the number of screening vessels.
Assuming the American fleet is still
guarding Hawaii when we strike.
Nimitz is crippled
and on the defensive.
He must deploy his remaining strength
around his most valuable Pacific base.
l agree with Admiral Nagumo.
We must make certain
where the enemy fleet is.
l propose we send 2 flying boats
to French Frigate Shoals on the 29th.
We fuel them by tanker submarine and
fly them to Pearl Harbor on the 30th.
They then report whether or not
the American fleet is actually there.
A very wise precaution indeed.
We will call it ''Dperation K''.
Does anyone have any other thoughts?
Yes.
We can achieve a great victory,
providing Nimitz and Halsey
do exactly what you expect.
The Enterprise and the Hornet
are due in by sundown.
The rest of the task force
should be in by morning.
The Yorktown is more
severely damaged than we thought.
How soon can we dry-dock her?
By the 17th, if a Jap sub
doesn't spot the oil she's trailing.
Admiral Fletcher
just radioed in with a repair list.
Tell the yard repairman l want
every workman he can get to board her.
That sharpshooter from Washington
just landed. Be here in 30 minutes.
Who did they send?
- Captain Vinton Maddox.
Maddox. He's a damned scalp hunter!
See that he's thoroughly briefed,
and get Captain Garth up here.
Admiral,
why don't you let me handle it?
No, he's entitled to a crack at me.
Phone that in.
Are those arming switches fixed?
- No, we still got some damn snafu.
Get them working 100% , or rip them
out of all our SBDs. ls that clear?
Yes, Sir.
- Get to it.
Sorry to drag you out of bed so early,
but it's our only chance to talk.
lt's DK. Did you get the report?
- Yup.
l've already read it.
Did you know your girl
belonged to those
Japanese patriotic organizations?
l saw the magazines,
but l didn't know it was propaganda.
The Attorney General's office
says it's subversive.
And the FBl doesn't think she's
telling the truth about coming here.
You can't blame them for that.
- Sure l can! And l can clear it up!
You cool down
and let me handle this!
Tom, l don't have time to fool around.
Do you want me to help you or not?
l guess l have no alternative,
do l, Sir?
l guess you don't.
Captain Maddox, Admiral Nimitz.
- Great pleasure, Sir.
Should we get right to it, Captain?
- Certainly, Admiral.
l'm sure you're aware of Washington's
opinion on this Midway invasion.
Yes. They think it's an enemy ruse.
An elaborate phony, Sir.
- Go on.
Could we speak in private?
- lf you'd feel more comfortable.
These enemy radio intercepts
your intelligence has accumulated ...
Very detailed ... - Too detailed.
Remember, just before December 7th?
The fake Japanese messages.
- These could be carbon copies.
Washington's sure Yamamoto's
feeding you this to hide his plans.
Very definitely possible.
Well, then how can you insist ...
- Because l believe it's factual.
l'm convinced
Yamamoto's target is Midway.
But if you're wrong, Admiral,
if you send our carriers
into a Japanese ambush,
the entire West Coast and Hawaii
will be open for invasion.
Fully aware of that, Captain.
You mean, the safe play
is to defend the home folks first?
With respects, Admiral,
it's the smart play.
Captain, if we surprise the enemy,
catch him where he's not expecting us,
we can drive him back 3,000 miles.
And keep him pinned till we can
take him on in his own front yard.
My instructions were
to convey Washington's deep concern
over the safety
of the West Coast and Hawaii.
ls Washington ordering me
to defend Hawaii or the West Coast?
No, Sir.
My orders were simply to consult.
No, Sir,
l have no such orders for you.
Commander Blake, send the fleet to
repel invasion. Target: Midway lsland.
lssue the order immediately.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Admiral, may l see you a moment?
- Excuse me, Captain.
Damn. You know how
Bill Halsey hates hospitals.
Maybe it's nothing serious.
- To get him anywhere near a hospital
it must be not only damn serious,
it must be critical.
Admiral, l have some really bad news.
- Today's the day for it.
The Japanese changed the J-N 25 code,
the one they used for Yamamoto's plan.
How long do you need for the new code?
- A month, maybe two.
Sir, do you still
want that fleet order issued?
Yes. Target: Midway.
Welcome aboard your flagship, Admiral.
Thank you, Captain.
Rear Admiral Kusaka,
my Chief of Staff. Captain Aoki.
Where's Commander Genda?
He's in sick bay, Admiral. lnfluenza.
When does the doctor think
he can resume his duties?
ln 2 or 3 days.
l don't like beginning this operation
without my best air commander.
We have another sick bay casualty:
Commander Fuchida has appendicitis.
Fuchida too?
We'll need a replacement.
Genda suggests
a veteran torpedo pilot:
Lieutenant Tomonaga.
lf Genda says so,
l want to see Tomonaga right away.
Yes, Sir.
Fuchida, the man who led
my first strike on Pearl Harbor, out.
Genda, who planned it, both ill.
Very bad luck, Sir, very bad luck.
Dnly an inconvenience, Sir.
We'll manage.
Good morning, Sir. - Lieutenant.
- Follow me, please.
Here we are. The Sakura family.
Yes. Thank you, Lieutenant.
l can find my own way out.
Miss Sakura,
l'm Captain Garth, Tom's father.
Please come in.
My parents, Tetsuro and Sada Sakura.
This is Captain Garth.
How do you do?
You want to speak to me in private.
My parents understand.
Yes. Well, thank you.
lf l embarrassed you, forgive me,
but l wanted you to see that they
are not a threat to national security.
l never really
thought they would be, Miss Sakura.
l suppose it goes with the times.
And l shouldn't be bitter?
l never said that.
Damn it, l'm an American!
What makes us different from
German-Americans or ltalian-Americans?
Pearl Harbor, l guess.
Look, l've read the FBl report.
Ask me anything you want to.
Alright.
Your father has been seen frequently
entering the Japanese consulate.
He has old friends there.
l see.
What about these
patriotic organizations you belong to?
My father enrolled me in those
when l was born.
Dut of respect for him
l never resigned, but l wasn't active.
l see.
What about those magazines
they found in your parents' apartment?
The ''Prairie Shimbun''?
Published in Wyoming.
My father has
deep emotional ties for Japan,
but even so he thought
it was a ridiculous propaganda sheet.
Why did he subscribe?
He's a traditional and honorable man.
He was once indebted to the man
who publishes the ''Prairie Shimbun''.
Look, Miss Sakura,
l understand you came to Hawaii
to ask your parents' permission
to marry my son.
Yes, l did.
Why didn't you tell that to the FBl?
- l didn't want to implicate Tom.
Why won't you see him?
He's in love with you, he tells me.
You won't even talk to him.
He doesn't understand. l don't either.
Because my parents have
forbidden me to marry outside my race.
l want you to tell him for me.
l can't tell him that.
He wouldn't believe me.
Besides, l'd just as soon
he didn't know we'd talked together.
Look, Miss Sakura,
Haruko,
Tom's based
at Kaneohe Naval Air Station.
Send for him, please.
You have to tell him this.
You have to tell him.
Damn itching is driving me crazy!
All those medics can do is
smear this God-awful paste on it.
When they get the nerve to come near.
- l know l'm a bad patient.
But a skin disease! Df all the stupid,
useless things to get laid up with!
lt's driving me nuts. l can't even
think! - We don't have much time.
Fletcher's docking the Yorktown now,
and l've got hard decisions to make.
Recommend your replacement.
- Ray Spruance.
l know he's junior
to a lot of other flag officers,
and never served a day on a carrier.
But Chet, he knows carrier tactics.
Well, you asked for my recommendation.
l can just picture
Washington's reaction
if l hand over the Hornet and
the Enterprise to a cruiser skipper.
Especially with the static l'm getting
for expecting the Japanese at Midway.
You told me once, Chet:
''When you're in command, command.''
Admiral Fletcher, Sir.
- Good morning, Sir.
Welcome home, Jack. Congratulations
on bringing your cripple in.
Well, we got lucky. - We haven't got
much time, so l'll make this fast.
Halsey's beached, in the hospital.
Won't be leaving for a while.
l'm sending you out again, Jack,
in 72 hours. ln full combat readiness.
That's impossible! lt'll be 3 months
before the Yorktown's in commission.
Spruance has replaced Halsey. He takes
Hornet and Enterprise to sea tomorrow.
You follow him 48 hours later.
Spruance is a cruiser commander!
- He knows carrier tactics.
Yeah, but he can't fly.
- Neither can you.
And he sure as hell
can't learn it by tomorrow, can he?
No.
Congratulations, Ray.
- Well, l'm still in a state of shock.
Nice seeing you again, Matt.
How's the hand? - Coming fine, Sir.
We could have used you at Coral Sea.
He's on your Air Dperations staff
on the Yorktown.
Good.
We face the biggest force the enemy
has ever sortied, over 200 ships.
They've got 4-to-1 supremacy.
Yamamoto himself is commanding.
We know when
and from where he's going to sail,
we know their original courses.
We don't know their rendezvous point,
course changes or when they'll strike.
They could hit from the northwest,
but intelligence doesn't support that.
Ray, assuming
this isn't just an elaborate ruse,
Washington thinks it is,
but assuming they're wrong,
what kind of move do you suggest?
Well, l'd take my carriers here,
to a point northeast of Midway,
and wait for Nagumo's carriers.
Why not head northwest
and hit them head-on?
There's a chance
Washington may be right.
You think Hawaii and the West Coast
could be the real target?
lt doesn't really matter, provided
l'm in a position to cut them off.
lf it's Midway, l'll bushwhack them.
Alright. Jack, you're senior. You take
command when you join up. - Yes, Sir.
The Yorktown will be at sea
in less than 72 hours.
l don't need to stress that Yamamoto
outweighs us in every department.
Dur 3 carriers are all that stands
between the enemy fleet and our coast.
Now, your point of rendezvous,
what should we call it?
''Point Luck'', Sir.
Sounds like a prayer,
but it's damned appropriate.
Son of a bitch!
Nurse!
Ray.
- Hi, Bill.
Wanted to call the nurse
to have that tree cut down.
lt spoils my view of the boatyard.
Feeling DK?
l can't sleep. l can't eat.
l just sit and scratch 24 hours a day.
You ever try an oatmeal
and water bath? Don't.
l want to thank you for recommending
me to take your place.
l have a question:
Did that itch go to your head?
Stop underestimating yourself.
Any skipper who can keep
his cruisers and destroyers
alongside my carriers across the whole
Pacific is the man for the job.
You know, you and l ...
Bill, we're kind of different.
You think l can do it as well as you?
l can only tell you this, Ray:
You play it the way you feel it,
not the way you think l'd play it.
You go to sea, find Yamamoto and
chew his ass. Nothing more to it.
Christ, no! You want to catch this?
We'd lose the God-damned war!
Dh, by the way,
l'll have somebody cut down
that tree for you. - Yeah.
ln carrying out the task
assigned in Dp-Plan 29/ 42,
Enterprise and Hornet will act
on the principle of calculated risk,
which means avoiding exposure
to attack by superior enemy forces
without good prospect of inflicting
greater damage to the enemy.
Sir, three boilers
are out of commission.
The yard manager says
he needs another two days.
Delaney, l expect the yard
to finish the job by 06:00 tomorrow.
Sorry about your boiler, Jack.
But if you clear Pearl by 07:00
you'll rendezvous with Enterprise
and Hornet on schedule.
Agreed.
- Good luck, good hunting. - Thanks.
You too, Matt. See you back here soon.
We just haven't any future, Tom.
l figured that's what it was.
We don't.
We really don't.
l wish you'd go now.
l don't love you anymore.
lt was a mistake.
Say it to my face.
say it to my face, God damn it!
lt'll be DK.
Shit. Wait and see!
dive-bombing off Haiti.
Everybody said:
''Premature, wait and see.''
We waited, then the Germans
showed us in '37 in Madrid.
You mean like at Pearl Harbor?
- Pearl Harbor, shit!
ln '32 it was proved that Pearl Harbor
could be attacked from the air.
And Admiral Ramsey predicted
it would happen, in detail.
When was that?
- 1937, pal.
Wait and see. We waited.
December 7th, we saw.
The wait-and-seers
will bust your ass every time.
l'll drink to that.
- Bet your ...
How long have you been here?
- Long enough to hear your lecture.
You ought to go on the radio.
How the hell are you?
Alright ... Well, l'm celebrating
my birthday. That's how l am.
That's a problem
we all have once a year.
My God,
now you got my kid flying for you.
How's the boy doing?
- Just fine.
He's a good pilot. Got him in an F4F.
He'll be shipping out any day.
Coming from you that means a lot.
No. He's good man, a natural pilot,
good attitude, good marksman.
Tom's only deficiency
would be in enemy identification.
He's got to learn, you don't win a war
by kissing the enemy.
For Christ's sake ... - Well, he told
the whole God-damned squadron.
l met her. She seems like a nice girl.
- So is Madame Butterfly.
She's having trouble with him.
- Now you're having trouble seeing.
l've got to shove off.
Scuttlebutt says you're going out
on the Yorktown. - That's right.
Well, keep your dumb ass
out of drafts. - That's right, buddy.
Thanks for keeping an eye on my boy.
l appreciate it.
He'll be fine, Matt.
Tom! - Nice of you
to take the time to see me off, Dad.
But your squadron isn't due to ship
for a week. Why are you boarding?
Are you saying you're surprised, Sir?
Your buddy Jessop transferred me.
l didn't know anything about it!
- Like hell you didn't!
You wanted me shipped out,
to stop me from doing anything stupid!
So your old buddy Jessop obliged.
- Tom, l knew nothing about it!
l have to report on board, Sir.
MARlNE lNTELLlGENCE
DK, Sir.
Captain Garth is here, Sir.
- Great. Come in, Matt. How are you?
l'm gonna do something l don't do,
at least not since Annapolis.
l'm gonna ask you to do me a favor.
- Ask away! Lord knows l owe you some.
This is an FBl enemy alien report.
- Where did you get this?
Don't ask.
Matt, l could find out.
- Don't, Harry.
The report contains all the bureau
has on ... - A Japanese?
Dn an American citizen
named Haruko Sakura und her parents.
They look DK to me,
but l'm not in your business.
lt sounds like you are.
Harry, l want you
to investigate this personally.
They'll be sent
to the mainland next week.
lf they're clean,
and l'm betting they are,
l want that shipment cancelled.
Matt, you're way out of line here!
This isn't your department!
This is tampering!
Alright, what have we got?
What are these people to you?
Someday,
the girl may be my daughter-in-law.
You're pressuring me to take
improper action for personal reasons.
lmproper action, hell!
They're no more
a threat to national security
than your pet Airedale.
l'll have to report your request.
lt'll go into your record.
lt's not for me.
You know l wouldn't ask you
for myself. l'm asking you for my kid.
Jesus Christ, Harry!
l'm begging you!
Alright, l'll investigate it.
Thanks, Harry.
And, Captain,
this'll wash it with us.
We're even.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Captain?
Thank you, Corporal.
Reporting as ordered, Sir.
Sorry to send the Marines after you,
but you didn't answer my messages.
We had nothing to talk about, Captain.
You can cut out that midshipman-crap,
you're talking to your old man.
l'll try to remember it.
l'd like to set the record straight:
Before we left Pearl,
l personally vouched
for Haruko and her parents,
and went way out on a limb for them.
l didn't know
what weight it would carry,
but you know, there it is.
Thanks.
Dne more thing:
l didn't ask your C.D.
to ship you out.
You spoke to him, didn't you?
- Yes, l did.
He asked me how l felt about ...
- Haruko and me, right?
lf you couldn't do anything about it,
why couldn't you leave it alone?
Jessop thought
he was doing us both a favor.
l did all l could,
and a lot more than l should've.
You're paid to fly fighter planes,
not to sit in your cabin
and cry over your girl's picture.
You better shape up, Tiger, before
a hot-shot Jap pilot flames your ass!
Just received this message, Sir.
Dperation K, the reconnaissance flight
to Pearl Harbor, has been cancelled.
Cancelled? Why?
Dur scout planes couldn't refuel.
An enemy vessel was there.
Sir, Admiral Nagumo's carrier force
should be warned immediately.
Admiral Nagumo must have picked up
the transmission when we did.
Suppose he didn't.
He will assume the American carriers
are at Pearl Harbor.
And that is where our latest
intelligence reports place them.
What latest intelligence reports?
Have any of our submarines sighted
the US fleet in the last 20 hours?
No, Sir. But there's no logical reason
for them to move their carriers.
We must not break radio silence and
risk letting them know our location.
The element of surprise is one of the
most important aspects of our attack.
Admiral, this is our search plan.
An air search involving 22 PBYs,
each plane flying 700 miles out,
covering an 8-degree sector.
We'll have a 180-degree view
at anything coming from the west,
and still have a flanking area
northeast of Midway for our carriers.
Have it put into operation right away.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Jesus, how many of those can you eat?
Admiral, air reconnaissance report.
No sightings.
ls there any defense measure
we've overlooked?
That had top priority, Admiral.
You sent everything we had:
tanks, PT boats, anti-aircraft guns.
lt's miserable waiting for an attack
on your own people, hoping it happens.
More pressure from Washington?
- Not a whisper.
Frankly,
l'd rather have them raising hell.
Captain.
- What's the count, Reid?
Half a dozen F4Fs and 15 Buffaloes.
Damned relics. - We'll show the Japs
we're up here. Maybe we'll get lucky.
DK, Reid.
ln less than 5 hours
Hosogaya will attack the Aleutians,
and we will still be groping to Midway
in this filthy squall.
We're not due to launch
our first air strike for 36 hours.
Dur predictions are for clear weather
before then, Admiral.
l keep wondering what Dperation K
uncovered at Pearl Harbor.
Were the American carriers there?
We've heard nothing from Yamamoto.
The American carriers must be there.
Damn communications blackout!
Hey, you guys!
The Japs are bombing Dutch Harbor!
Here we go.
Well, Gentlemen, it's started.
Signal Spruance.
The Aleutian lslands
are being invaded, Admiral.
Washington could still be right.
lt could be a feint for an attack
on the West Coast or here in Hawaii.
Dr what we've defended against.
Today. Dur PBY should tell us today.
Hey, do you see what l see?
Damn right, l do!
Sparks, raise Midway.
Radio: Main body.
That's all? Just ''Main body''?
- Send it! - Yes, Sir.
An American PBY, Sir.
A reconnaissance seaplane!
Radio's picked up it's transmission.
lt's alerting Midway.
Break radio silence.
Advise Admiral Yamamoto:
lnvasion force has been discovered.
Admiral.
- You were right, it's Midway.
Enigma!
You know what l mean, Admiral.
- Fletcher's joined Spruance on time.
Another one from Strawberry-9, Sir.
Just what kind of ships?
First transmission said ''Main body'',
but didn't mention carriers.
That PBY, Strawberry-9,
was at the end of his 700-mile leg.
Nagumo's carriers could be
following the large ships.
Maybe beyond his horizon.
lf they are, Fletcher's too far north.
He has to move at top speed now to get
within striking distance by sunset.
But if Nagumo's carriers are
coming in behind the storm front ...
Fletcher'd be caught
between two forces.
Yes, if we let him head
for that main body sighting.
Send a flash message to Fletcher:
This is not, repeat, NDT main body.
Expect enemy carrier strike
tomorrow behind storm front ...
... via northwest, as anticipated.
Signed, Nimitz.
CinCPAC must think the PBY
sighted only Kondo's invasion force.
But if it's Nagumo's attack force
with its carriers,
and its scouts find us
before we find them ...
Sound general quarters!
Weather is clearing, Admiral.
We could not have timed it better.
We intercepted a radio transmission
from Tokyo to Admiral Yamamoto.
lntelligence does not report
any movement of the American fleet.
Whatever doubts we may have had ...
- They still are with me, Kusaka.
We have no definitive intelligence
reports, only opinions and estimates.
And Yamamoto's silence
does not make them a fact.
Admiral.
- Genda.
My apologies. l've been
away from my duties much too long.
Genda, how are you?
l'm well enough
to take charge of air operations.
And so you shall, my friend.
Prepare an air search plan right away.
- For what area?
Where l would deploy my carriers
if l were an American commander.
There, northeast of Midway.
Times like this,
Joe, l miss the flatlands.
lt's a big body of water out there.
l'm a fella from the Texas prairie.
Nearest lake was 120 miles away.
You could wade across it
at the height of the rainy season.
During summer
we made clay pots out of its bottom.
Whatever happens, Joe, you sure
as hell earned your pay this month.
Well, thank you, Sir.
To cover the area, we will launch
scout planes from Akagi and Kaga,
and our cruiser escorts
will launch 5 seaplanes.
Very good. And until our scouts
have searched the area,
we'll hold our most experienced pilots
and half our aircraft in reserve.
But the American fleet
can't be anywhere near Midway. We
shouldn't hold back our best pilots.
We've been over this before.
Admiral,
our first strike must be decisive.
lf we don't destroy Midway's airstrip
and planes, we invite a counterstrike.
Commander Genda?
l agree with you, Sir.
Let our younger pilots
fly the first strike.
l am sure they can do the job.
lf not, we can launch a second strike.
That is how it will be.
Suddenly, the man who led us
to victory at Pearl Harbor
is choked by caution.
He senses danger out there.
So do l.
Their transports wouldn't be so close
if they didn't plan to invade soon.
CinCPAC's right.
They'll hit Midway today.
Yes, but from where?
He could pop out anywhere.
And then his scout planes will be out.
- We have to find him first.
lf he hits our blind side ...
Why don't we get some eyes out there?
DK. But no more than 100 miles out.
l want to recover them fast,
in case the PBYs make contact first.
You DK?
- Yeah. - Here.
The poor bastards'll miss all the fun.
There's nothing north of us but ocean.
He gets his dope straight
from Tokyo Rose. Right, Chili Bean?
Wrong, from here.
When it bristles there's Japs around.
You're crazy!
'Morning, Captain. - You're supposed
to be sacked out. What're you doing?
We couldn't sleep.
l know, but get below and try.
We got a heavy day ahead.
Yes, Sir.
Excellent weather forecast.
Broken cloud cover up to 2,000 feet
to conceal us from enemy scout planes,
and above unlimited visibility
straight into Midway for our flyers.
Commence launching.
All our cruisers' scout planes
are in the air, except one.
The Tone is having catapult problems.
A delay in launching scout 4.
- How long?
Half an hour, Sir.
ln case the Americans suddenly appear,
l suggest bringing the 2nd flight wave
on deck as soon as the 1st is clear.
Armed with torpedoes
to deal with enemy carriers? - Yes.
Dur planes and the Kaga's.
Soryu and Hiryu can stand by
with bombs for Midway.
Give the order.
- Yes, Sir.
Now it's up to our strike leader.
Tomonaga is the best we've got.
Howie?
lt's the whole damn Jap navy!
Radio, raise Midway.
Send: Enemy carriers.
We got 'em! lt's Jap fighter cover.
- Let's duck into the clouds.
''Enemy carriers''? That's all?
That's all Strawberry-5 said.
We haven't heard from him since.
lf he was on course and on schedule,
he made the contact about here,
You better signal it to Spruance.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
You certain it was Strawberry-5?
Positive, Skipper.
How far are we
from that contact point?
We're 15 minutes behind schedule.
Bandits! Sweet mother of God,
hundreds! - Where, damn it?
Four ... no, five o'clock!
Jesus!
Billy, send this quick:
Many planes heading Midway.
Are you certain?
Alright, just let us know
the second you get anything else.
Nothing more. No word from our scouts
since that ''Many planes'' flash.
Yes, but was that from Strawberry-5?
- No call letters were sent.
Maybe he was jumped
by enemy fighters.
Damn it! How many carriers?
What course? What speed?
Those Japs
will never find us in this soup.
And we'll never find their carriers
unless we break into the clear.
Damn it!
l should've risked going straight in.
Nothin'. We've lost 'em!
Lieutenant, they're behind us!
l see 2 carriers and a battleship.
Send it!
- Aye-aye, Sir.
''Fletcher to Spruance. Second
sighting reported, Strawberry-5:
Bearing: Midway, 320 degrees.
Distance: 180 miles.
Course: 135 degrees.
Speed: 25 knots.''
Came right out of the slot
where Nimitz figured.
''Proceed southwesterly,
attack enemy carriers.
Will follow as soon as
search planes recovered. Fletcher.''
Signal ''Ahoy'', Captain Browning.
To battle stations.
Get the control tower.
Andy, Major Parks get his fighters up?
All 23. The SBDs are ready to go.
Get 'em airborne.
- Yes, Sir.
Captain, we've got
Major Parks' frequency.
Rainbow Leader.
Below us, 10 o'clock.
l see 'em, Kirk.
Alright, everybody.
Let's see how many
we can drop on the first pass.
Two bogies under you!
Got one! Look at that Jap bastard!
Get him off me!
Dn your tail!
Comin' in on you!
l'm hit, Rainbow Leader!
My God! Mayday, mayday!
Look out, Rainbow! Dn your tail!
Comin' in on you! Three of 'em!
Look at that Jap bastard!
My God, they got Major Parks!
Look out! Two bogies, four o'clock!
Rainbow Leader, come in!
This is Noah's Ark.
Report please!
What is your condition? Report!
Good God!
Give me the tower.
Andy, they blew
right through Parks' fighters!
Get your people under shelter!
Jesus!
Come on!
Attack in squadron order!
God, they creamed us!
- But we're not out of action yet.
Dur landing strip's still operational.
Tomonaga
is asking for a second strike.
Sir, this report is a great victory.
We've lost only 7 planes.
We've destroyed 40 enemy aircraft,
in the air and on the ground.
But the pilots you chose
did not destroy the airstrip.
We have 93 planes and our best pilots
waiting on our flight decks.
The entire force should be sent now.
The entire force? Dur planes are armed
with torpedoes on Genda's advice.
Hardly suitable for bombing
an airstrip. Correct, Commander?
They should be immediately
rearmed with bombs below deck.
We must make certain
that Midway can mount no air attacks.
Lieutenant Tomonaga's request
is also a warning.
Midway is still a threat to us.
So are the American carriers.
lf they are nearby, yes.
But after 2 hours,
our scouts have reported nothing.
You're forgetting, scout number 4
was a half-hour late taking off.
lt will not reach it's maximum
search range for another hour.
Tomonaga's planes
will be returning soon.
They can be quickly refueled
and rearmed for sea action.
ln case our scouts
sight any enemy ships.
Admiral?
Very well.
Drder our torpedo bombers
to be rearmed with contact bombs.
As soon as they are ready,
we will launch a 2nd strike on Midway.
The Hornet will probably
launch about the same number.
What's the enemy carriers' position?
- 135 miles, Sir.
lf we launch immediately,
do our pilots have enough fuel?
Yes, Sir. lf the weather holds,
they navigate perfectly and
aren't over the target too long.
lf we launch now, we might
catch Nagumo like a sitting duck.
lf we wait, it will give him time
to refuel and reload.
Sir, the PBY reported only 2 carriers.
l know.
- lntelligence says he has 4.
lf those other 2 suddenly pop up ...
- Then we'd be sitting ducks.
But we have 2 certain targets
Let's get Enterprise
and Hornet turned into the wind.
lt's from Admiral Spruance.
Enterprise and Hornet are launching
every aircraft they've got.
Air controller reports our strike
force will be over the deck in 1 hour.
Just the time we need to finish
arming our bombers for the 2nd strike.
Your confidence
is most reassuring, Kusaka.
Dur scouts report no enemy carriers.
They've started their homeward leg.
All except scout number 4.
Bearing: 010 degrees. Distance: 240
miles from Midway. Speed: 20 knots.
Which scout radioed the contact?
- Number 4, Sir.
How far along are we on rearming?
- Almost half, Sir.
Drder it halted.
Radio scout 4 to ascertain
ship types and maintain contact.
Friendlies, Sir.
Dur search planes returning.
They'll be on board
in under 15 minutes.
Have Captain Buckmaster see to it.
Dur planes from Enterprise and Hornet
should hit the Jap carriers in 1 hour.
They're not on the same course?
We're counting on it, Admiral.
Nagumo has to hold course
until he recovers his planes.
with unfueled aircraft on his decks.
l don't see our fighters, Sir.
They should've caught up to us by now.
And where's Bombing 8?
With Fighting 8.
They took off together.
Ain't they supposed to be with us?
Red Fox Leader to Kit 3.
Red Fox Leader to Kit 3!
Either my compass is fouled up,
or we're not heading 240.
There's nothing out there.
l know where the Japs are, Mr. Gay.
Will you tell us, Sir?
l figure they moved east
since we launched, away from Midway.
Roger. - What good's our orders,
if the skipper's gonna lead us off?
l don't like it.
Take it easy.
lf anybody can find the Japs,
Waldron can. He's part Sioux lndian!
Sir, another message from scout 4.
miles from Midway. Speed: 20 knots.
Apparently 2 cruisers,
a carrier believed to be the Yorktown.
lmpossible. The Yorktown was
virtually destroyed at Coral Sea.
They can't have repaired her
and brought her here in 10 days.
We must assume they have!
lf it is it,
we must destroy her at once.
l see.
Suddenly, the threat
from Midway's bombers seems
less to you than when you urged me
to rearm our planes with bombs!
Admiral, Midway must wait.
We should rearm our bombers
and attack that carrier.
Back to torpedoes again?
More wasted time! - Tomonaga,
this is Genda. Do you read me?
Lieutenant Tomonaga,
this is Commander Genda.
Do you read me?
- l read you, Sir. - Report please.
Request permission to land. My pilots
report almost empty fuel tanks.
Some have taken anti-aircraft hits.
Urgent we land immediately, Sir.
Do l have permission?
Admiral Yamaguchi advises
that we attack the enemy carrier and
launch our bombers at once,
however they're armed.
While we're launching, Sir, Tomonaga's
pilots will crash into the sea!
They're running out of fuel, Admiral.
Alright.
Wait until we've recovered
all our airborne aircraft.
While they are landing on the deck,
rearm our bomber with torpedoes.
Then we'll attack the enemy carrier.
That's the last of our scouts, Sir.
Tell Eliot to launch all we've got.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Pilots, man your planes!
Admiral, all aircraft now on board.
Tomonaga?
- He was the last to touch down.
l want to close range on the enemy
carrier. Steer northeast. Full speed!
From Admiral Nagumo:
''Enemy force composed of
sighted 250 miles from Midway.
We are headed for it.''
Dne carrier?
Close to Midway. Not Pearl Harbor!
Admiral Nagumo will simply destroy it
a few days earlier than planned.
Dh, thanks, Matt.
l'd give my retirement pay
to know what Nagumo's doing.
The same thing we are, Admiral,
sweating it out.
Skipper!
l see it.
What'd l tell you, Huntington?
The skipper can smell them out.
See if you can raise Bombing 8
and Fighting 8. They must be near.
Better coordinate the attack.
- Yes, Sir.
Red Fox 8 Leader to Badger 8 Leader!
Red Fox 8 Leader to Badger 8 Leader!
Do you read me?
DK, we can't wait all day.
You better get ready, Dobs.
Red Fox Leader to Kits,
we're going in!
Divisions 2 and 4, take the carrier.
Divisions 1 and 3, ram the escorts.
And stay together as long as you can.
l say again: stay in tight!
Admiral, enemy torpedo bombers
off port quarter!
They're coming in
without fighter protection.
Mindless suicide!
Perhaps.
But it's an effective technique.
We can't attack their carrier
while we're busy dodging them.
They're using up all our fighters.
Bandits, 11 o'clock! Look out!
Two of them. Shoot, shoot!
This is Kit 6, l got 3 of them
on my tail. Somebody help me!
Below you, bandits! No, no!
Dh God damn! No!
Stay in formation!
Get in. Close up, you idiots!
They'll jump us to pieces!
l'm hit, l'm hit! Dh, Jesus!
Dobs, behind you! Bandits behind you!
Look out!
Huntington, coming in at 10 o'clock!
Huntington!
Huntington, are you dead?
Follow me.
Waldron, get your nose up!
Pull up, pull up!
What happened?
- Dne of our torpedo groups attacked.
Yeah, but which one?
What the hell happened?
Casualty report, Sir:
Dne of our fighters took a minor hit,
no shipboard damage, no casualties.
A whole squadron. 15 brave crews.
Torpedo 3 going in at 1,500 feet.
Bombing 3 and Fighting 3 at 1,900.
Who's coordinating the attack?
- Max Leslie. He's leading Bombing 3.
Helen Leader to Helen group:
Time to arm your bombs.
l say again: Arm bombs!
God damn it!
Don't touch
that damned electric arming switch!
Use manual control!
Too late, Commander. Mine dropped.
- Mine dropped too.
Rotten gadget! Who the hell
invented the electric arming switch?
Yamamoto, who else? Now what?
Should we drop spitballs on the Japs?
Alright, knock it off.
The rest, use manual control!
Helen Leader, out.
Skipper, look at Chili Bean over here!
l feel them!
Hope he's right.
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader,
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader:
Japs on the horizon!
l got 3 ...
Sweet Jesus, l got 4 Jap carriers!
Holy hell, we hit the jackpot!
Yes, sky watch?
- Enemy torpedo planes! - How many?
Two separate groups.
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader:
How's about it? You boys ready?
Damn right, we're ready!
Let's go, we're running out of fuel!
Roger. Bertha 3 Leader to Small Fry:
Concentrate on the closest flattop.
Push in close and get hits!
l count 12
coming in from starboard, Admiral.
All these can't be from one carrier.
They must be coming from Midway.
- Dr a second carrier.
We've heard nothing from scout 4 since
it sighted the one enemy carrier.
Soryu should send out its scout plane.
We must make certain
of what we're up against.
See to it immediately.
- Yes, Sir.
Lining up to jump us, Thach.
About 12 Japs.
We're right above them.
Mabel 3 to Hustlers: Break 'em up!
Score 1 for Commander Thach!
Bogy! Comin' in on you, 3 of 'em!
That a boy, Tom!
Run that bastard into the drink!
Ramos, 2 o'clock!
Nice shootin' !
More comin' in at 1 o'clock!
You got him! Nice goin' !
Mabel 3 Leader to Hustler Tom:
Roll out, Tom! Dive, dive!
We've quashed all of their attacks,
and not one torpedo has come close.
Sacrifice themselves like samurai,
these Americans.
That last attack pulled our entire
fighter cover down to sea level.
Now they're looking for survivors.
We have no fighter umbrella over us?
- No, Sir.
We're trying to recall them,
get them back up to patrol altitude.
How many fighters are standing by
to cover our attack on that carrier?
Barely enough to do the job.
They're American carriers,
no doubt about it, Yorktown class.
Get through
to Nagumo's flagship. Be quick!
Why are you waiting?
The transmitter isn't working.
We're not sending out any signal!
What's it look like down there?
A Jap destroyer!
Going someplace
in one hell of a hurry.
DK, follow it. See where it leads us.
Commander McClusky, look at
the fuel gauge. We have to turn back.
l know, l know.
The last two attacks were made
by over 50 torpedo planes. 50!
There is more than one
enemy carrier nearby. There must be!
Admiral. - Genda, why hasn't
the Soryu's scout plane reported?
We don't know. lt should have sighted
the American ships 10 minutes ago.
Sir, all the bombers
are rearmed and ready.
Signal all carriers:
Launch immediately!
There they are, dead ahead.
Sweet mother, look at them!
Huey, the whole Jap navy!
- Pipe down till l report contact!
Raven Leader to Mother Goose:
Have them in sight.
l say again: 4 enemy carriers.
Helen Leader to Mabel and Bertha!
Come in Bertha, come in Mabel!
This is Helen Leader. We have contact.
Come in Bertha, come in Mabel!
l'm sorry, Commander Leslie,
Torpedo 3 and Fighting 3 don't answer.
Keep trying. We're supposed to
coordinate our attack.
Either their navigation is fouled up
or this is the wrong rendezvous point.
Keep trying, damn it!
Mabel Leader, come in!
Raven Leader to flock: They're turning
into the wind, preparing to launch.
l don't see any Jap fighters, Sir.
Let's not wait for 'em! Fall in!
lt's no use. Commander Massey
and Commander Thach don't answer.
DK, hang on. We're going in.
Sir, we don't have a bomb! - We can
draw some heat off the guys that do.
This is Helen Leader. Concentrate
on that big bastard up forward.
Commander McClusky, they've got
bombs all over their flight deck!
Bull's eye!
Scratch one flattop! Caught him cold!
Raven Leader to Raven 6.
l got a hit, Commander McClusky.
Bring it home, girls, bring it home!
Bull's eye!
Commander, l got a hit!
Look at that bastard burn!
Beautiful, Helen 3, dead center!
We caught 'em flat-footed!
No fighters and a deck full of bombs!
Sweet Mary, how did we get so lucky?
Helen Leader to squadron:
Time to go home.
Admiral, you must transfer your flag.
The cruiser Nagara is close by.
Advise Admiral Yamaguchi.
l can't tell you where to find the
enemy carriers, Lieutenant Kobayashi.
Their last position was radioed
by scout 4 several hours ago.
Hasn't the Soryu scout reported, Sir?
- lt hasn't been heard from.
Then how do l find them, Sir?
- Fly to their last reported position.
Then just trust your luck
that somehow you will find them.
Do you hear anything? - Nothing.
All enemy frequencies are silent.
Lieutenant, enemy planes!
- l see them.
Dur fighters
are forming for an attack!
Signal them to lay back with us.
- Lay back ... - Stay off the radio!
We'll let them
lead us to their carrier.
l got all Max Leslie's bombers, Sir.
- Where's the rest of Thach's planes?
Dff the port quarter, Sir.
l'll bring the fighters down first.
They'll be the lowest on fuel.
Jesus!
He's alive, Captain.
Flight Mission Combat!
- Go ahead.
Radar has more aircraft, bandits.
Roger. Bandits, Sir.
Sound general quarters!
We took a bomb hit to the side.
The boilers are out.
Admiral, the radio's down. We can't
send visual signals in this smoke.
You better transfer the flag, Sir.
l suggest to the Astoria.
Matt, you better stay aboard,
help Murray with the flight ops.
Lower the barge.
- Have the Admiral's barge lowered!
This is Zephyr calling Whirlwind:
Enemy carrier on fire!
l repeat: Enemy carrier on fire.
Returning to base.
That wasn't Kobayashi. - None
of the senior officers survived.
The scout plane from the Soryu
is approaching. His radio is out.
He's gonna be DK, Captain.
- We'll transfer him in half an hour.
Hi, Dad.
l'll see you back at Pearl, Tom.
There's a picture of Haruko and me
that l'd like you to bring ashore.
l'll take care of it, Tiger.
Thanks, Dad.
Dnly 1 boiler in use, Sir. 5 are out.
- Can you get 'em on the line again?
Yes, Sir. l think l can guarantee
you 15 knots in an hour.
Very good. Delaney, tell your gang
the topside fires are under control.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Matt, we have more planes than pilots.
Can you fly one for me?
Sure.
MARlNE lNTELLlGENCE
Did you confirm it?
- Yes, Sir. Fletcher's reply is here.
''Fletcher to Nimitz: Confirm
Hallelujah!
lsn't that worth a ''hot-diggity-damn''?
Good advice, Joe, but there's still
that 4th enemy carrier to deal with.
A message from Captain Buckmaster:
The Yorktown's been hit.
Badly? - Yes, but she's underway.
- Dperational?
Dur whole force may be in jeopardy
if the Japanese locate the Yorktown.
They still have a tremendous fleet.
But that 4th carrier can't be far off.
We've already won a great victory,
Admiral.
Maybe we should get our people back.
- Break off, run for home?
Before they can hurt us again? Yes.
That may be the smart play.
Trouble is: l want that 4th carrier!
What's wrong?
- Your right wing tank is punctured.
We haven't had time to repair it.
- ls the left tank fueled? - Yes, Sir.
A few hours ago
we filled the sky with our planes.
Now we win or lose
with 6 fighters and 10 torpedo planes.
The skipper wants to know, can you
maintain this speed? - 18 knots.
Very good. - All we gotta do
is find that 4th Jap flattop.
Bridge-phone, Combat.
- Go ahead, Combat.
Report from Scouting 5.
Adams located the 4th enemy flattop.
Good. Relay our position to Fletcher.
We found him, Delaney. Just give us
all the old lady's got left.
Sir, radar has bandits.
Distance: 35 miles, closing.
They're coming in low.
- Torpedoes! - Sound general quarters!
Let's get everything airborne
while we still can.
General quarters!
Man all battle stations!
Right 4 rudder!
- Aye-aye!
Watch out! Get down!
Whirlwind, this is Zephyr 3!
Two torpedoes hit the carrier!
l repeat: Two torpedoes
hit the carrier! Returning to base.
Now it's one against one, Admiral.
Congratulations.
Delaney, what's the situation below?
No good. All boilers are out.
Get your people topside, fast!
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Larry, radio Enterprise:
We'll land there after our bomb run.
Yes, Sir.
Blue Leader to all planes ...
How many are we sending out?
- 24 dive-bombers.
We'll have to try it
without fighter protection.
What about the Hornet?
- Scraping the bottom of the barrel.
is bringing 3 from the Yorktown.
Signal the Hornet:
We attack immediately. - Aye-aye, Sir.
That wasn't the carrier
Kobayashi dive-bombed.
She was undamaged.
We put 2 torpedoes into it.
Kobayashi said the carrier was
on fire. Did you see any smoke?
No, Sir, it must have sunk.
We didn't see a 3rd carrier, either.
Dive alert! Enemy dive-bombers!
Sir, we must withdraw.
How will we apologize to His Majesty?
Leave that to me.
l am the only one
who must apologize to His Majesty.
Thank you.
That was the LSD, Sir.
Matt Garth is coming in.
His plane is all shot up.
l wonder if Matt knew how big we won.
l think l know what he'd have said:
''lt doesn't make any sense, Admiral.
Yamamoto had everything going for him,
power, experience, confidence ...
Were we better than the Japanese,
or just luckier?''
