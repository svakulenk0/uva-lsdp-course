Saigon.
Shit.
I'm still only in Saigon.
Every time, I think
I'm going to wake up
back in the jungle.
When I was home
after my first tour,
it was worse.
I'd wake up,
and there'd be nothing.
I hardly said a word
to my wife,
until I said yes
to a divorce.
When I was here,
I wanted to be there.
When I was there,
All I could think of
was getting
back into the jungle.
I'm here a week now...
waiting for a mission,
getting softer.
Every minute
I stay in this room,
I get weaker.
Every minute
Charlie squats in the bush,
he gets stronger.
Each time I looked around,
the walls moved in
a little tighter.
Everyone gets
everything he wants.
I wanted a mission,
and for my sins,
they gave me one.
Brought it up to me
like room service.
Captain Willard,
are you in there?
Yeah, I'm coming.
It was
a real choice mission,
and when it was over,
I'd never want another.
What do you want?
Are you all right,
Captain?
What's it look like?
Are you Captain Willard,
Affirmative.
assigned to Salk?
Hey, buddy,
are you going to
shut the door?
We have orders to
escort you to the airfield.
What are the charges?
Sir?
What did I do?
There's no charges,
Captain.
You have orders to report
to Com-Sec lntelligence,
Nha Trang.
All right?
Nha Trang for me.
That's right.
Come on, Captain.
You still have a few hours
to get cleaned up.
Captain?
Dave, give me a hand.
We got a dead one.
Come on, Captain.
Let's take a shower.
We're going to take
a shower, Captain.
ln we go.
Now, stand underneath
this, Captain.
Aah!
Ohhh...
I was going to the worst
place in the world,
and I didn't even
know it yet.
Weeks away
and hundreds of miles
up a river
snaking through the war
like a main circuit cable
plugged straight
into Kurtz.
It was no accident
that I got to be the caretaker
of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's
memory...
any more than being back
in Saigon was an accident.
There is no way
to tell his story
without telling my own,
and if his story
is really a confession,
then so is mine.
Come in.
Thank you, sir.
Stand at ease.
Want a cigarette?
No, thank you, sir.
Captain, have you ever seen
this gentleman before?
No, sir.
Met the general or myself?
No, sir.
Not personally.
You've worked a lot
on your own?
Yes, sir, I have.
Your report specifies
intelligence with Com-Sec.
I'm not disposed to
discuss those operations.
Did you not work
for the ClA and I Corps?
No, sir.
Did you not assassinate
a government
tax collector,
Quang Tri province,
June 18, 1968?
Captain?
Sir, I'm unaware of
any such activity
or operation...
nor would I be disposed
to discuss
such an operation
if it did
in fact exist, sir.
I thought we'd have lunch
while we talk.
I hope you brought
a good appetite, Captain.
I noticed that you
have a bad hand there.
Are you wounded?
A little
fishing accident
on R and R, sir.
Fishing on R and R?
Yes, sir.
But you're
ready for duty?
Yes, General.
Very much so, sir.
Well, let's see
what we have here.
Roast beef.
Usually
it's not bad.
Try some, Jerry,
and pass it around.
To save a little time,
we might pass both ways.
Uh...Captain...
I don't know how you feel
about this shrimp,
but if you'll eat it,
you'll never have to
prove your courage
in any other way.
Why don't I just
take a piece here?
Captain, you've heard
of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?
Um...yes, sir,
I've heard the name.
Oh...Jesus.
Operations Officer,
Luke, would you
play that tape
for the captain, please?
Listen to this carefully.
Sector Peter Victor King.
This was monitored
out of Cambodia.
This has been verified
as Colonel Kurtz's voice.
I watched a snail
crawl along the edge...
of a straight razor.
That's my dream.
That's my nightmare.
Crawling...slithering...
along the edge...
of a straight razor...
and surviving.
Transmission 11
received 68 December 30,
sector King Zulu King.
But we must kill them.
We must incinerate them.
Pig after pig,
cow after cow...
village after village,
army after army,
and they call me
an assassin.
What do you call it
when the assassins
accuse the assassin?
They lie.
They lie,
and we have to be merciful
to those who lie.
Those...nabobs...
I hate them.
I do hate them.
Walt Kurtz was one of the
most outstanding officers
this country
has ever produced.
He was brilliant.
He was outstanding
in every way,
and he was
a good man, too.
A humanitarian man,
a man of wit and humor.
He joined
the Special Forces.
And after that, his...
ideas, methods
became...
unsound.
Unsound.
Now he's crossed into Cambodia
with this...
Montagnard army of his
that worship the man
like a god
and follow every order,
however ridiculous.
Well, I have some other
shocking news to tell you.
Colonel Kurtz was about
to be arrested for murder.
I don't follow, sir.
Murdered who?
Kurtz had ordered
the execution
of some Vietnamese
intelligence agents,
men he believed
were double agents.
So he took matters
into his own hands.
Well, you see, Willard,
in this war,
things get...
confused out there--
power, ideals,
the old morality,
and practical
military necessity.
But out there
with these natives,
it must be a temptation
to...be God.
Because there's a conflict
in every human heart,
between the rational
and irrational,
between good and evil,
and good does not
always triumph.
Sometimes...
the dark side
overcomes
what Lincoln called
"the better angels
of our nature."
Every man has got
a breaking point.
You and I have one.
Walt Kurtz
has reached his,
and very obviously,
he has gone insane.
Yes, sir.
Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.
Your mission is to proceed
up the Nung River,
pick up Colonel Kurtz's path
at Nu Mung Ba,
follow it,
and learn what you can.
When you find the colonel,
infiltrate his team by
whatever means available
and terminate
the Colonel's command.
Terminate... the Colonel?
He's out there
operating without
any decent restraint,
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable
human conduct,
and he's still in the field
commanding troops.
Terminate...
with extreme prejudice.
You understand,
Captain,
that this mission
does not exist...
nor will it
ever exist.
How many people
had I already killed?
There were those six
I knew about for sure,
close enough
to blow their last breath
in my face.
But this time,
it was an American
and an officer.
That wasn't supposed to
make any difference to me,
but it did.
Shit, charging a man
with murder in this place
was like handing out
speeding tickets
at the lndy 500.
I took the mission.
What the hell else
was I going to do?
But I really didn't know
what I'd do
when I found him.
I was being ferried
down the coast
in a navy PBR,
a type of
plastic patrol boat,
pretty common sight
on the rivers.
They said it was a good way
to pick up information
without drawing
much attention.
That was OK.
I needed the air
and the time.
Only problem was,
I wouldn't be alone.
Morning, Captain.
The crew were mostly
just kids,
rock 'n' rollers
with one foot in their graves.
How old are you?
The machinist,
the one they called Chef,
was from New Orleans.
He was wrapped too tight
for Vietnam...
probably wrapped too tight
for New Orleans.
Lance was a famous surfer
from the beaches south of L.A.
To look at him,
you wouldn't believe
he'd ever fired a weapon.
Clean--Mr. Clean--was from
some South Bronx shit hole.
I think the light
and space of Vietnam
really put the zap
on his head.
Then there was Phillips,
the chief.
It might have been
my mission,
but it was
the chief's boat.
There's about two points
where we can get
into the Nung River.
They're both hot.
They belong to Charlie.
Don't worry about it.
I don't smoke.
I pulled a few
special ops in here.
About six months ago,
I took a man
who was going up
past the bridge
at Do Lung.
He was regular army, too.
I heard he shot
himself in the head.
Good morning, Vietnam.
I'm Army Specialist
Zack Johnson on AFVN.
It's 82 degrees
in downtown Saigon
and also very humid.
We have
an important message
from the mayor of Saigon.
Yeah!
Hang your laundry indoors
instead of
on the window sills.
The mayor wants you to
keep Saigon beautiful.
Here's another blast
from the past
going out to Big Sam
who's with 1st Battalion,
Dedicated by the fire team
at An Khage.
The Rolling Stones...
Satisfaction.
Ooh. All right!
Watch out, Clean!
Get down, bubber!
All right!
Look out, Lance!
Sayonara!
At first,
I thought they handed me
the wrong dossier.
I couldn't believe
they wanted this man dead.
Third generation
West Point,
top of his class,
Korea, Airborne,
about a thousand
decorations,
et cetera, et cetera.
I'd heard his voice
on the tape,
and it really
put the hook in me,
but I couldn't connect up
that voice
with this man.
Like they said, he had
an impressive career,
maybe too impressive.
I mean perfect.
He was being groomed
for one of the top slots
in the corporation--
general, chief of staff,
anything.
ln 1964, he returned from
a tour in Vietnam,
and things
started to slip.
His report to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and Lyndon Johnson
was restricted.
Seems they didn't dig
what he had to say.
He made three requests
for transfer
to airborne training,
Fort Benning, Georgia,
and was finally accepted.
Airborne.
He was 38 years old.
Why the fuck
would he do that?
"1966,
"joins Special Forces,
returns Vietnam."
What's that?
Arc light.
B-52 strike.
What's that?
Arc light.
Every time I hear that,
something terrible happens.
Charlie don't never
see them or hear them.
There they are!
Concussion sucks the air
from your lungs.
Something terrible's
going to happen.
Smoke!
Secondary burn.
Hueys over there,
lots of hueys.
Let's have a look, Chief.
It was the Air Cav.
That's them.
Our escorts to the mouth
of the Nung River.
But they were
supposed to wait
another
Well, Air Mobile--
those boys just
couldn't stay put.
an old cavalry division.
It traded its horses
for choppers
and gone around Nam
looking for the shit.
They'd given Charlie
a few surprises in their time.
What they were mopping up
hadn't even happened
an hour ago.
Keep going.
Don't look
at the camera.
Just go by
like you're fighting.
It's for television.
Just go through.
Keep on going.
Don't look at the camera.
Where can l
find the C.O.?
Over there.
Roll up the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.
Captain Willard.
I carry
priority papers
From Com-Sec
Intelligence 11 Corps.
I understand that Nha Trang
briefed you on my mission.
What mission?
I haven't heard from Nha Trang.
Your unit is
supposed to escort us.
OK, but
stay out of my way
until this is done.
All right.
Let's see what we have.
Two of spades.
Three of spades.
Four of diamonds.
Six of clubs.
Eight of spades.
lsn't one worth a jack
in the whole bunch.
Hey, Captain, what's that?
Death cards.
What?
Death cards.
Lets Charlie know
who did this.
Cheer up, son.
We will not hurt you.
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole!
We are here to help you.
We are here to extend
a welcome hand...
Come on.
Everybody in?
Get in. Hurry up.
Move it out.
Hey! Hey, what's this?
What is this?
This man's hurt
pretty bad, sir.
The only thing holding
his guts in
is that pot lid.
What do you have
to say?
He is dirty V.C.
He wants water.
He can drink paddy water.
Get out of here!
Give me that canteen!
He's a V.C.
Any man
brave enough to--
Get out of here
before I kick
your fucking ass!
He killing our people!
Any man brave enought to fight
with his guts hanging out
can drink from
my canteen any day.
Colonel, that sailor is
Lance Johnson, the surfer.
Where, here in Chua?
Down there.
Repeat. We have a body count...
What's your name, sailor?
Gunner's Mate Third Class,
L. Johnson, sir.
Gunner's Mate--
Lance Johnson, the surfer?
Yes, sir.
Well, it's an honor
to meet you, Lance.
I've admired your
nose-riding for years.
I like your cutback, too.
Thank you, sir.
You cut the "sir"
crap, Lance.
I'm Bill Kilgore.
I'm a goofy foot.
This guy with you?
Yeah.
This is Mike
from San Diego,
Johnny from Malibu.
Pretty solid surfers.
Not anywhere near
your class, though.
We do a lot of
surfing around here.
I like to finish
operations early,
fly down to Vuong Tha
for the evening class.
With Him in the unity
of the Holy Spirit...
all glory and honor
is Yours, Almighty Father.
Let us pray in the words
Our Savior gave us.
Our Father who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...
Kilgore had had
a pretty good day.
They choppered in
T-bones and beer
and turned the L.Z.
into a beach party.
The more they tried
to make it like home,
the more they made
everybody miss it.
Make my meat rare.
Rare, but not cold.
Well, he wasn't
a bad officer, I guess.
He loved his boys,
and you felt safe
with him.
He had that weird light
around him.
He knew
he wouldn't get hurt.
What happened
to your mission, Captain?
Nha Trang
forget all about you?
Sir?
Two places we can
get into the river.
Here and here.
These are the only
two spots
I'm really sure of.
That village is hairy.
What do you mean?
It's hairy.
Got some heavy ordnance.
I lost a few
recon ships there.
What's the name
of that damn village?
Damn gook names
all sound the same.
Mike, you know anything
about this point
at Vinh Dinh Drap?
That's a fantastic peak.
Peak?
About 6 foot.
It's got both the long
right and left slide.
It's unbelievable.
It's just tube city.
Why didn't you
tell me that before?
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole country.
It's all god damned
beach break.
They shot the hell
out of us there.
That's Charlie's point.
Sir, we can
go in at dawn.
There's offshore
breezes then.
The boat may not make it.
The draft at the river's
mouth may be too shallow.
Hell, we'll put
your boat down
right where you want it.
This is the Air Cav, son.
Air Mobile.
I can hold that point.
You can get anyplace
up that river
that suits you, Captain.
Hell, a 6-foot peak.
Ha ha!
I'd like to take a gunship
back to the division.
Lance, go with Mike.
Pick out a board.
Bring my 8'6".
What is it, soldier?
It's pretty hairy in there.
That's Charlie's point.
Charlie don't surf!
Jesus, Clean, you ain't
going to believe this.
Look.
Hey, man, they're
picking up the boat!
How you feeling, Jimmy?
Like a mean
motherfucker, sir!
All right, son,
let her rip.
I've never gotten used
to a light board.
I'm used to
a heavy board.
I know.
It's a real drag.
What do you prefer?
Heavier.
Really? I thought
the young guys
liked lighter boards.
You can't ride the nose.
Big Duke 6,
this is Eagle Thrust.
We've got it spotted.
Big Duke 6,
put on
heading 2-7-0.
assume attack formation.
That's a roger, Big Duke.
OK, we're going in.
We'll come in low
out of the rising sun.
A mile out,
we'll put on the music.
Music?
Yeah, I use Wagner.
It scares the hell
out of the slopes.
My boys love it.
They're going to play music!
How come all you guys
sit on
your helmets?
So we don't
get our balls blown off.
Big Duke 6
to Eagle Thrust.
Put on psy-war-op.
Make it loud.
This is
a Romeo Foxtrot.
Shall we dance?
Surf!
Run, Charlie!
There's an automatic 50 cal!
I've spotted
a large weapon below.
We'll go check it out.
Outstanding, Red Team,
outstanding.
Get you a case of beer
for that one.
we're over the village.
I see a vehicle.
I'll check it out.
Well done, Hawks,
well done.
I want
some 20-mike-mike
right along
those tree lines.
Ripple the shit
out of them.
Got a vehicle on the bridge,
Big Duke 6.
Clear the area.
I'm coming down myself.
These people never give up.
Nice shot, Bill.
Un-ash that shit.
Get it out of here!
It's just a flare.
It's all right.
Just a flare.
Everybody OK?
Lance, you all right?
Fine!
I'm not going!
I'm not going!
I'm not going!
We just got secondaries
down there on the plaza.
Hold on to our position--
Duke 6, Duke 6.
We've got wounded down there.
Ah!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Get a stretcher over here!
I can't stand it!
Please, God, help me!
Aah!
Give him some morphine.
Where's that stretcher?
I want my wounded out
and in the hospital
in 15 minutes.
Somebody stay in there
tight with Big Duke.
She's got a grenade!
She's got a grenade!
The fuckin' savages.
Holy Christ!
She's a sap.
I'm going to get
that dink bitch.
Get over there, Johnny.
I'm rolling this
skid right up her ass.
There's goddamn heat
over there.
I'm taking fire.
I'm taking hits all over.
Drawing fire.
Drawing fire.
Drawing fire.
Drawing fire.
Mayday! Mayday!
I'm going in.
My tail rotor's out.
What do you think?
It's really
exciting, man.
No, no! The waves!
Oh, right.
Look at that.
Breaks both ways.
Watch! Watch! Sheeew!
Look! Good 6-foot swells!
Go, reds, go!
Go on, pump it!
Come here, Lance.
lncoming!
This L.Z.'s
still pretty hot.
Maybe you should
surf somewhere else.
What do you know
about surfing?
You're from goddamn New Jersey.
Come here.
Mike, come here!
Change.
You mean right now, sir?
I want to see
how rideable that stuff is.
It's still pretty
hairy out there.
You want to surf,
soldier?
Yes, sir.
Good. Because you
either surf or fight.
ls that clear?
Now get going.
I'll cover for you.
Bring a board for Lance.
Can't do shit
till the boat gets here!
Lance.
I'll bet you can't wait
to get out there.
What?
See how
they break both ways?
One guy can break right,
one left,
simultaneously.
What do you think
of that?
We should wait
for the tide to come up.
Lance, come here.
Look! Look!
lncoming!
The tide doesn't come in
for six hours.
You want to wait here
for six hours?
Yo!
Hey! Chief!
OK, fellas, quit hiding.
Come on.
Let's go.
Goddamn it!
Don't you think
it's risky for R and R?
lf I say it's safe
to surf this beach,
it's safe
to surf this beach.
I'm not afraid
to surf this place.
I'll show you something.
Give me that R.T., soldier.
This is Big Duke 6.
Goddamn it.
I want that tree line bombed.
Big Duke 6, roger.
Bomb them into
the stone age, son.
They need some napalm
down near the tree line.
Can you put
it down there?
Roger, 1-3.
Going to suppress
some mortar fire
off the tree line
down there.
Roger. Here we come.
Good. Give it all you got.
Bring in all your ships.
Don't worry.
We'll have this place cleaned up
and ready for us
in a jiffy, son.
Big Duke 6, this is Dove 1-3.
You got about
a 30-second stall.
Get your people back
and heads down.
It's going to be
a big one.
Lance, look at that.
Do you see that? Look.
Do you smell that?
Do you smell that?
What?
Napalm, son.
Nothing else in the world
smells like that.
I love the smell
of napalm in the morning.
One time we had
a hill bombed for 12 hours.
When it was all over,
I walked up.
We didn't find
one stinking dink body.
But the smell--
You know,
that gasoline smell,
the whole hill.
It smelled like...
victory.
Someday this war's
going to end.
Lance.
Light it up, man.
Come on.
Let's get high.
Smoke?
"Someday this war's
going to end."
That'd be fine
with the boys on the boat.
They were just looking
for a way back home.
Captain?
Trouble is,
I'd been back there,
and I knew that it
just didn't exist anymore.
Puddin' time.
All right!
That's great, isn't it?
Yeah.
lf that's how Kilgore
fought the war,
I began to wonder
what they really had
against Kurtz.
It wasn't just
insanity and murder.
There was enough of that
to go around for everyone.
This lady
became his mistress.
I mean, he never was
hurting for pussy here.
Ha ha ha ha!
I'm walking
through the jungle
gathering mangoes.
I meet Raquel Welch.
Make a nice
mango cream pudding.
You know, kind of
spread it around on us.
Hey, Captain, I want
to get some mangoes.
Don't go out by yourself.
You don't want
to go in there alone,
not unless you really
know the territory.
Any poisonous snakes
around here?
Fuck it. I want to
go get some mangoes.
Chef.
Yes, sir?
How come they
call you that?
Call me what, sir?
Chef. Because you like
mangoes and stuff?
No, sir. I'm a real chef.
I'm a saucier.
Saucier?
Yes, sir.
See, I come
from New Orleans.
I was raised to be a saucier.
Great saucier.
What's a saucier?
We specialize in sauces.
Got to be a mango tree
here somewhere.
Then I was supposed
to go to Paris,
study at
the Escoffier school.
Then I got orders
for my physical.
Hell, I joined the navy.
Heard they had better food.
Cook school, that did it.
Yeah? How's that?
Oh, you don't want
to hear about that.
They lined us up in front
of a hundred yards
of prime rib.
All of us lined up
looking at it.
Magnificent meat. Really.
Beautifully marbled.
Magnifique.
Next thing they're
throwing the meat
into these big cauldrons.
All of it. Boiling it.
I looked inside, man.
It was turning gray.
I couldn't fucking
believe that one,
so I applied for
radioman's school,
but then they gave
me the engine mach--
What is it?
Charlie?
Aah! Look out!
Aah!
It's a fucking tiger!
It's a tiger, man!
A tiger!
Lance, get up front!
Behind the 60, Clean!
Got it, babe.
Oh, shit.
Chef, come on!
Fucking tiger!
Captain, come on!
Move out! Let's go!
Let's go!
Man.
You were right!
Never leave the boat!
Clean, bring
that 60 forward!
What?
I got to remember,
never get out of the boat!
Never get out of the boat!
Get out of here now!
How many is it?
Fucking tiger!
What?
Tiger?
I didn't come here for this!
I don't want this goddamn
fucking shit, man!
You can kiss my ass because
I'm fucking bugging out!
I didn't come here for this!
I don't fucking need it!
I don't want it!
I didn't get
on the goddamn train
for this kind of shit!
All I want to do
is fucking cook!
I just want
to learn to fucking cook!
You're all right.
It's all right.
What happened, bro?
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
It's going
to be all right.
All right.
It's going
to be all right.
It's going to be
all right.
Never get out
of the fucking boat.
Hi, tiger!
Bye, tiger!
Goodbye!
"Never get out of the boat."
Absolutely goddamn right.
Unless you were going
all the way.
Kurtz got off the boat.
He split from the whole
fuckin' program.
How did that happen?
What did he see here
that first tour?
lf you joined
the Green Berets,
there was no way you'd ever
get above colonel.
Kurtz knew what
he was giving up.
The more I read
and began to understand,
the more I admired him.
His family and friends
couldn't understand it,
and they couldn't
talk him out of it.
He applied three times
and put up
with a ton of shit.
When he threatened
to resign,
they gave it to him.
The next youngest guy
in his class
was half his age.
They must have thought
he was some far-out old man
humping over that course.
I did that when I was 19.
It damn near wasted me.
A tough motherfucker.
He finished it.
He could have gone
for general...
but he went
for himself instead.
Dear Eva,
today was really a new one.
Almost got eaten alive
by a fucking tiger.
Really un-fucking-believable,
you know?
We're taking this guy
Captain Willard up the river,
but he hasn't told us yet
where we're taking him.
Thought you might have
heard by now from...
October, 1967.
On special assignment,
Kontum province, 11 corps.
Kurtz staged
Operation Archangel
with combined local forces.
Rated a major success.
He received
no official clearance.
He just thought it up
and did it.
What balls.
They were going to nail
his ass to the floorboards
for that one,
but after the press
got hold of it,
they promoted him
to full colonel instead.
Ah, man.
The bullshit piled up
so fast in Vietnam,
you needed wings
to stay above it.
This sure enough
is a bizarre sight
in the middle
of this shit.
They expecting us this time?
Damned if I know.
Anybody hear me?
Hello? Hello? 1...1...
Jesus.
Let's back up
into this truck.
What?
We got to get
all this stuff
off the truck.
You ever been up
here before, Chef?
I bet you could
score up here.
Yo, man.
Check out the bikes, man.
Yamahas.
Suzuki. Yeah, that's a good one.
Yeah. Sukiyaki.
Hey, man. This is...
This must be the guy.
Right up there.
Three drums of diesel fuel.
Come on, man, move.
We don't have time.
What do you want?
Can I get some panama red?
Panama red? Yeah.
Sergeant.
Destination?
I don't have
no destination.
I can't do nothing
without a destination.
Sergeant.
Without a destination,
I can't do a goddamn thing.
Hey, sarge,
these guys are with me.
Destination's classified.
Here are priority papers
from Com-Sec lntelligence.
OK. Right, sir.
Listen, it's
a real big night.
Hey!
Just give him some fuel.
You got it.
Hey, listen, Captain.
I'm really sorry
about tonight.
It's really bad around here.
Just take this over to the man
at the supply desk,
and you got it.
Would you guys like
some seats for the show?
You want those?
The show. The show out here.
The bunnies.
What bunnies?
The Playboy bunnies?
You got it.
Hey, listen, Captain.
On the house.
No hard feelings, huh?
How you doing out there?
I said, how you doing
out there?
We want to say hello
to all of you out there
who worked so goddamn hard
on Operation Brute Force.
Hello to all you
paratroopers out there!
And the Marines!
And the sailors!
- Yay!
- Boo!
We're proud of you.
We know how tough
and hard it's been. Yeah.
To prove it, we're going to
give you some entertainment
we know you'll like!
Miss August--
Miss Sandra Bayne.
Miss May--Miss Terri Turee!
Yeah!
And the Playmate of the Year--
Miss Terri Foster!
Yeah! Let's go!
Grease my gun!
You're cute.
I like you.
I'm here, baby!
I'm here.
You fucking bitch!
Take it off!
Hey, lover, you want
us to come over?
I sure do!
Sign my centerfold!
Take it off! Take it off!
Take it off! Take it off!
Get the girls! Let's go!
So long.
Charlie didn't get
much USO.
He was dug in too deep
or moving too fast.
His idea of great R and R
was cold rice
and a little rat meat.
He had only two ways home--
death...
or victory.
No wonder Kurtz put a weed
up command's ass.
The war was being run
by a bunch of four-star clowns
who'd end up giving
the whole circus away.
Do you believe
I got to come here
and find her here?
Ho! Shit!
Like shit.
Chicken time.
You ain't shitting,
brown motherfucking--
Who is that?
What's going on?
What the fuck is that?
ls that you, Lazaro?
Come on, man.
Don't chicken out now.
Fire on the canvas!
I got it! I got it!
I got it!
Get out of there!
Lance! Lance!
Late summer. Autumn, 1968.
Kurtz's patrols
in the highlands
coming under
frequent ambush.
The camp started
falling apart.
November.
Kurtz orders assassination
of three Vietnamese men
and one woman.
Two of the men
were colonels
in the South Vietnamese Army.
Enemy activity
in his old sector
dropped off to nothing.
Guess he must have hit
the right four people.
He joined
the Special Forces,
and after that,
his, uh...
The army tried one last time
to bring him
back into the fold.
lf he'd pulled over,
it alI would have
been forgotten,
but he kept going.
And he kept
winning it his way.
Montagnard army...
And they called me in.
...man like a god,
and follow every order,
however ridiculous.
They lost him.
He was gone.
Nothing but rumors
and random intelligence,
mostly from captured V.C.
The V.C. knew his name
by now,
and they were
scared of him.
His men were playing
hit and run
all the way into Cambodia.
I'm going to
the Vietnam White House
to have dinner
with the president
of the United States.
That's where I'm going.
Hey, Chef,
put the cover on that.
Clean.
How long has that kid
been on this boat?
Seven months.
He's really specializing
in busting my balls.
It's very possible,
Captain,
he thinks the same
of you.
Oh, yeah?
What do you think, Chief?
I don't think.
My orders say
I'm not supposed to know
where I'm taking this boat,
but one look at you,
and I know
it's going to be hot,
wherever it is.
We're going upriver
about 75 clicks above
the Do Lung Bridge.
That's Cambodia, Captain.
That's classified.
We're not supposed
to be in Cambodia,
but that's
where I'm going.
Get me close
to my destination,
and I'll cut you loose.
All right, Captain.
"Dear son,
"I'm afraid that both you
and your mother
"will have been worried
at not hearing from me,
"but my situation here has
become a difficult one.
"I have been officially
accused of murder
by the army."
"The alleged victims were
four Vietnamese double agents.
"We spent months
uncovering them
and accumulating evidence."
"When absolute proof
was completed,
"we acted like soldiers.
"The charges
are unjustified.
"They are, in fact,
"and in the circumstances
of this conflict,
quite completely insane."
"ln a war,
there are many moments
"for compassion
and tender action.
"There are many moments
for ruthless action--
"what is often
called ruthless--
"but may in many
circumstances be only clarity--
"seeing clearly
what there is to be done
"and doing it--
directly, quickly, awake.
Looking at it."
"I will trust you
to tell your mother
"what you choose
about this letter.
"As for the charges
against me,
"I am unconcerned.
"I am beyond their timid,
lying morality,
and so I am beyond caring."
"You have all my faith.
Your loving father."
Shut the fuck up!
I'm sure sorry about that.
lf I'd known,
I'd take you to New Orleans.
I'll get you fixed up.
Lay off, Chef.
I want to break
your fucking head!
Lay off, Chef!
When are you going
to do it?
Chef! I said now!
Chef! Knock it off!
Give him a break!
What did I say?
And give your jaws a rest!
And this ain't the army.
You're a sailor!
Get out of that army shit
and stop smoking that dope!
You hear me?
Lance, what's with
all the green paint?
Camouflage.
How's that?
So they can't see you.
They're everywhere.
Stay awake
up there, man.
You got a job to do.
Sampan off the port bow.
Sampan off the port bow.
Let's take a look.
Lance, bring 'em in!
Clean, on the 60.
Chef, get a 16.
Clean, get on that 60!
What's up, Chief?
We're going to take
a routine check.
Let's forget routine now
and let them go.
These boats are
running supplies.
I'm going
to take a look.
Chief, my mission's
got priority here.
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.
Until we reach
your destination,
you're just on
for the ride.
Stand by, Lance.
Throw the rope!
All right, come on.
Let's bring it over.
Look in that hold.
Bring the people out of there.
Come on.
Hurry up, motherfucker!
Move it, gook!
Keep your eyes open, Clean.
I got you, Chief.
That's them.
Yeah, they're OK.
Board and search it.
Ain't nothing on it.
Board it and search it.
Just baskets and ducks.
Bananas.
Ain't nothing on it.
What's wrong with you?
Board and search.
Look. Just a goat
and some fish.
Chef--
There's nothing--
Get on that boat!
There's nothing on it!
Get on it!
All right!
Move it, asshole!
Goddamn it!
Pigs. Look. Mangoes.
What's in the rice bag?
Rice.
Well, look in there!
Fucking fish.
More coconuts.
Rice. Here's rice.
What's in that
vegetable basket?
Get out of here!
Come on.
Aah!
Chef, check that
vegetable basket.
Shut up, slope.
Nothing.
What's in the boxes?
Nothing.
Look in that tin can.
Just fucking rice!
That's all!
Check the yellow can.
Nothing!
She was sitting on it.
Chef!
Motherfuckers!
Motherfuckers!
Motherfuckers!
Cocksuckers!
Come on!
Let's kill them all!
Huh, idiots?
Fucking cocksucking
mothers!
Hold it!
Let's shoot the shit
out of all of them!
Hold it!
Why not?
Jesus Christ!
Why the fuck not?
Clean.
I'm good.
You OK, Lance?
Fucking shit!
Look what she was
hiding, huh?
You all right?
See what she was
running for?
It's a fucking puppy.
It's a fucking puppy.
Give me that dog!
No!
Give it to me!
No! Give me
the fucking dog, asshole!
Fuck you!
Take the fucking mango,
too!
You want that?
Chef, she's moving
behind you.
She's alive.
Check her out.
Fucking--
Chef! She's moving
behind you!
Check her out!
All right.
Come on, Clean.
Give me a hand.
Give him a hand.
Fucking...
Take it easy.
Just take it easy.
Slow down
and take it easy.
Calm down.
Wait a minute.
ls she breathing,
Chef?
She's hurt.
She's bleeding.
Bring her on board.
We'll take her to some ARVNs.
What are you talking about?
I'm taking her
to some friendlies.
She's wounded.
She's not dead.
Get out of there, Chef.
- The book says, Captain--
Aah!
Fuck you. Fuck them.
I told you not to stop.
Now let's go.
It was a way we had over here
of living with ourselves.
We'd cut them in half
with a machine gun
and give them a Band-Aid.
It was a lie.
And the more
I saw of them,
the more I hated lies.
Those boys would never
look at me the same way again,
but I felt like I knew
a few things about Kurtz
that weren't
in the dossier.
Do Lung Bridge
was the last army outpost
on the Nung River.
Beyond it,
there was only Kurtz.
Lance.
Hey, Lance,
what do you think?
It's beautiful.
Huh? What's
the matter with you?
You're acting kind of weird.
You know that last tab
of acid I was saving?
Yeah.
I dropped it.
You dropped acid?
Far out.
Friendly!
Friendly! Friendly!
Take me home!
Goddamn it!
Fucking shore police!
Shit! You want to die?
Take me home!
Motherfuckers!
Hey!
You fucking police!
Don't leave me!
Fuck you!
You'll get
what you deserve!
ls there a Captain Willard
on board?
Yeah.
Who's that?
Lieutenant Carlson, sir.
Get that light off me!
I was sent from
Nha Trang with these
three days ago, sir.
Expected you here sooner.
This is mail for the boat.
You don't know
how happy this makes me, sir.
Now I can get out of here--
if I can find a way.
You're in the asshole
of the world, Captain!
Captain,
where you going?
I got to find somebody.
I need some information.
Meet me at the other side
of the bridge.
Somebody go with him.
Chef.
I'll go.
I want to go.
Man, listen to
the music, man.
Where can l
find the C.O.?
You came
right to it,
son of a bitch!
Lance!
Get down here!
You still got
a commanding officer here?
Beverly Hills.
What?
Straight up the road,
there's a fucking bunker
called Beverly Hills.
Where the fuck else
do you think it would be?
Goddamn it!
You stepped in my face.
I thought you were dead.
You thought wrong,
damn it.
I told you to stop
fucking with me!
Think you're so bad,
huh, nigger?
What are you
shooting at, soldier?
What the fuck
do you think?
I'm sorry, sir.
There are gooks
by the wire.
I think I killed them.
You ain't shot shit, man.
Listen.
He's trying to call his friends, man.
Send up a flare.
You think
you so bad, nigger?
They're all dead,
stupid.
There's one still alive
underneath them bodies.
Who's
the commanding officer?
Ain't you?
You think
you so bad, huh?
I got something for
your ass, nigger!
I got something
for you now!
He's underneath
the bodies, man.
Go get the roach,
nigger!
I'll get the roach.
Go get him.
Roach.
Roach.
Roach.
You got slopes
on the wires.
You hear him?
Lance!
Do you hear him?
Well, bust him.
Hey, G.I.s!
Fuck you!
You hear him out there
on the wire, man?
Yeah.
I kill you, G.I.s!
You need a flare?
No.
He's close, man.
He's real close.
G.I.s, fuck you!
G.I.s!
G.I.s! Fuck y--
Motherfucker.
Hey, soldier.
Do you know
who's in command here?
Yeah.
Aah!
Aah!
Holy shit.
Chief, two guys just got
blown off that bridge.
You hang on, man.
You're going to be OK.
What's that?
Mail, man.
Later on mail.
Watch them trees.
There's no diesel fuel,
But I picked up
some ammo.
Move out.
Did you find
the C.O., Captain?
There's no fucking C.O.
here.
Let's just get going.
Which way, Captain?
You know which way, Chief.
You're on your own,
Captain.
StilI want to go on?
Like this bridge--
we build it every night,
Charlie
blows it up again.
Just so the generals
can say the road's open.
Think about it.
Who cares?
Just get us upriver!
Chef,
on the bow.
Stand by, Clean.
Let's go!
Whose package is that?
You got another one, Clean.
No shit.
Wait, is that it?
That's it for you.
Lance!
Mr. L.B. Johnson.
There you go.
Far out, man.
All right!
I've been waiting
for this one.
I got another one.
I got a box from Eva.
"Lance, I hope you're fine."
I'm fine!
I'm going to get
back to Antoine's.
How could I fucking
forget, man?
Man, you know,
that's the best.
"There could never be
"a place like Disneyland,
or could there?
Let me know."
Jim, it's here.
It really is here.
"There has been
a new development
"regarding your mission
"which we must now
communicate to you.
"Months ago, a man
was ordered on a mission
"identical to yours.
"We have reason to believe
"that he is now operating
with Colonel Kurtz.
"Saigon was
carrying him MlA
"for his family's sake,
"but they assumed
he was dead.
"Then they intercepted
a letter
he tried to send
to his wife."
Captain Richard Colby.
He was with Kurtz.
Disneyland.
Fuck, man, this is
better than Disneyland.
"Charles Miller Manson
"ordered the slaughter
of all in the home
as a symbol of protest."
That's really weird,
ain't it?
Purple Haze. Look.
Lance, give me that smoke.
I got a tape from my mom.
Reality, man.
Hey, Chief,
get a good whiff.
Eva can't picture me
in Vietnam.
She pictures me at home
having a beer, watching TV.
Hey, Lance, man.
Ooh! Hot potato!
Hot potato!
So glad you decided
to join the--
Hey, Eva's not sure
she could have
a relationship with me.
Here I am,
trying to keep
a relationship with my ass.
...that's more
than I can say
for some of
your friends.
lf this tape is any good,
I will have dad
and the family
send you a tape.
Hey, Lance.
There! Over there!
Motherfucker!
Chef! Chef!
Check out Clean!
Captain, he's hit.
Clean's hit!
Where'd the dog go?
Lance,
check out Clean!
Where's the dog?
We got to go back and get the dog!
Hey, Clean!
Hey.
Hey, bubba!
Bubba, you can't die,
you fucker!
Hey, bubba!
And so I'm hoping
that pretty soon,
but not too soon,
but pretty soon,
I'll have lots
of grandchildren
to love and spoil.
Then when your wife
gets them back,
she'll be mad with me.
Ha ha ha.
Even Aunt Jessie and Mama
will come to celebrate
your coming home.
Granny and Dad are trying
to get enough money
to get you a car,
but don't tell them
because that's our secret.
Anyhow, do the right thing,
stay out of the way
of the bullets,
and bring your heinie home
all in one piece
because we love you
very much.
Love, Mom.
Can't see nothing.
We're stopping.
You're not authorized
to stop this boat, Chief.
I can't see a thing,
Captain.
I'm stopping this boat.
I ain't risking
no more lives.
I'm in command here,
goddamn it.
You'lI do what I say.
You see anything, Chef?
Why don't they
fucking attack, man?
Watch it over here, Chief!
Let's do it.
Lance, on the 50.
He was close.
He was real close.
I couldn't see him yet,
but I could feel him,
as if the boat
were being sucked upriver
and the water was flowing
back into the jungle.
Whatever was going
to happen,
it wouldn't be
the way they called it
back in Nha Trang.
Arrows!
Chef!
Chef, open up fire!
Lance, fire!
Chef!
Chef, it's OK!
Quit firing!
They're just little toy arrows!
Cut it out! Quiet!
Chief, tell them
to hold their fire!
They're just trying
to scare us.
Quiet!
You can't get us
out of this mess
Because you don't know
where the hell you're going.
Do you?
You son of a bitch!
A spear.
My mission was
to get into Cambodia.
There's a Green Beret
Colonel up there
who's gone insane.
I was supposed
to kill him.
That's fucking typical.
Shit!
Fucking Vietnam mission.
I'm short,
and we got to go up there
so you can kill
one of our guys.
That's fucking great!
That's just fucking great, man!
Shit! That's fucking crazy!
I thought
you were going in
to blow up a bridge
or some fucking railroad
tracks or something.
Sorry.
No. No, wait.
We'll go together
on the boat.
We'll go with you.
We'll go up there,
but on the boat.
OK?
Part of me was afraid
of what I would find
and what I would do
when I got there.
I knew the risks...
or imagined I knew.
But the thing
I felt the most,
much stronger than fear,
was the desire
to confront him.
Just keep moving.
Lance, keep your hands
away from the guns.
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!
I ain't coming in there!
Them bastards attacked us!
Come on!
Zap them with your siren, man!
Zap them
with your siren!
There's mines over there
and over there, too!
And watch out.
Those goddamn monkeys bite you.
Wow. That's a pretty one.
Move it right in
toward me.
I'm an American.
Yeah! American civilian.
Hi, yanks.
Hi. American.
American civilian.
It's all right.
You got the cigarettes.
That's what I've
been dreaming of.
Chef...
Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm a photojournalist.
I've covered the war
since '64.
I've been in Laos,
Cambodia, Nam.
A-phew-whee!
Phew-whee, baby!
I'll tell you one thing.
This boat is a mess, man.
Who are all these people?
They think you've come to...
to take him away.
I hope
that isn't true.
Take who away?
Him!
Colonel Kurtz.
These are all
his children, man,
As far as you can see.
Hell, man, out here,
we're all his children.
Could we, uh,
talk to Colonel Kurtz?
Hey, man,
you don't talk
to the colonel.
You listen to him.
Uh...the man's
enlarged my mind.
He's a poet-warrior
in the classic sense.
I mean, sometimes,
you'll say hello to him.
He'll just
walk right by you.
He won't
even notice you.
Then suddenly
he'll grab you,
throw you in a corner,
and say,
"do you know that if
is the middle word in life?
lf you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you--"
I can't--
I'm a little man.
He's a great man.
I should have been
a pair of ragged claws
scuttling across floors
of silent seas.
Stay with the boat.
Don't go
without me, OK?
I want to
get a picture.
He can be terrible,
and he can be mean,
and he can be right.
He's fighting the war.
He's a great man.
I mean...
I wish I had words.
I wish I had words.
I could tell you something like
the other day,
he wanted to kill me.
Why did he
want to kill you?
Because I took his picture.
He said, "if you take
my picture again,
I'm going to kill you."
And he meant it.
So you just lay cool,
play it cool,
Lay back, dig it?
He gets friendly again.
He really does.
But you don't--
You don't--
You don't judge
the colonel.
You don't judge the colonel
like
an ordinary man.
OK, watch it now.
These are Americans!
American!
Feel the vibe
of this place.
Let me
take your picture.
Hey, could you--
Hello?
Could you hold it
a minute?
Colby.
The heads.
You're looking
at the heads.
Hey, sometimes
he goes too far.
He's the first one
to admit it.
He's gone crazy.
Wrong! Wrong!
lf you could have
heard the man
just two days ago...
lf you could have
heard him then.
You're going to call him crazy?
Fuckin' A.
I just want
to talk to him.
Well, man,
he's gone away.
Disappeared
out in the jungle
with his people.
I'll wait for him.
He feels comfortable
with his people.
He forgets himself
with his people.
He forgets himself.
Captain.
Maybe we should wait
back at the boat.
OK, Chef.
We'll go back
to the boat for a while.
Yeah.
Stay with Lance.
This colonel guy,
he's wacko, man.
He's worse than crazy--
He's evil.
That's what the man's
got set up here.
Man, it's fucking
pagan idolatry!
Look around you.
Shit, he's loco.
Then you'll help me?
Help you? fuckin' A,
I'll help you.
I'lI do anything to
get out of this joint.
We could blow
all them assholes away.
They're so fucking
spaced out,
they wouldn't
even know it.
I ain't afraid of
all them fucking skulls
and altars and shit.
I used to think if
I died in an evil place,
then my soul
wouldn't be able
to make it to heaven.
But now...
Fuck.
I mean, I don't care
where it goes
as long as
it ain't here.
So what do you
want to do?
I'll kill the fuck.
Get out of here.
I'm going to need you
to wait here.
I'll go up with Lance,
scrounge around,
check the place out,
see if I can find
the colonel. OK?
What do you
want me to do?
Damn it.
Here.
Here, take the radio,
and if l
don't get back
by 2200 hours,
you'll call in
the air strike.
Air strike?
The code is "Almighty,"
coordinates
It's all in there.
Everything I saw told me
that Kurtz had gone insane.
The place
was full of bodies--
North Vietnamese,
Vietcong, Cambodians.
lf I was still alive,
it was because
he wanted me that way.
Hey!
It smelled like
slow death in there.
Malaria...
Nightmares.
This was the end
of the river all right.
Where are you from,
Willard?
I'm from Ohio, sir.
Were you born there?
Yes.
Whereabouts?
Toledo, sir.
How far are you
from the river?
The Ohio River,
sir?
Uh-huh.
About 200 miles.
I went down that river once
when I was a kid.
There's a place
in the river--
I can't remember.
Must have been
a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation
at one time.
It's all wild
and overgrown now,
but for about 5 miles,
you'd think that heaven
just fell on the Earth
in the form
of gardenias.
Have you ever considered...
any real freedoms?
Freedoms from the opinion
of others...
even the opinions
of yourself?
Did they say why...
Willard...
why they want
to terminate my command?
I was sent on a
classified mission, sir.
It's no longer classified,
is it?
What did they tell you?
They told me...
that you had gone...
totally insane.
And, uh...
that your...
methods were...
unsound.
Are my methods unsound?
I don't see...
any method...
at all, sir.
I expected...
someone like you.
What did you expect?
Are you an assassin?
I'm a soldier.
You're neither.
You're an errand boy...
sent by grocery clerks...
to collect a bill.
Why, huh?
Why would
a nice guy like you
want to kill a genius?
Going in
pretty good, huh?
Why?
You know...
do you know
that the man...
the man
really likes you?
He likes you.
He really likes you.
But...
he's got something
in mind for you.
Aren't you
curious about that?
I'm curious.
I'm very curious.
Are you curious?
There's something
happening out here, man.
You know something, man?
I know something
that you don't know.
That's right, jack.
The man is clear
in his mind,
but his soul is mad.
Oh, yeah.
He's dying, I think.
He hates all this.
He hates it.
But the man's, uh...
He reads poetry
out loud, all right?
And a voice...
A voice...
He likes you 'cause
you're still alive.
He's got plans for you.
I'm not going to help you.
You're going to help him.
You're going to help him.
What are they going to say
when he's gone?
'Cause he dies when it dies--
When it dies, he dies.
What are they going
to say about him?
That he was a kind man,
he was a wise man?
He had plans,
he had wisdom?
Bullshit, man!
Am I going to be the one
to set them straight?
Look at me--
Wrong.
You.
Almost eight hours.
God.
I'm asleep.
I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat.
Fuck.
Has it been
eight hours?
Hello, Almighty,
Almighty.
This is PBR Street Gang.
Radio check, over.
PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty
standing by, over.
Ooh! Ooh!
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, Christ!
Oh!
"We are the hollow men,
"We are the stuffed men,
"Leaning together
headpiece filled with straw.
"Alas! Our dried voices
when we whisper together
"Are quiet
and meaningless
As wind in dry grass..."
Oh, he's out there.
He's really out there.
"Shape without form..."
"Shade without color.
"Paralyzed force...
Gesture without motion."
Do you know
what the man's saying?
Do you?
This is dialectics.
It's very simple dialectics--
One through nine.
No maybes, no supposes,
no fractions.
You can't
travel in space.
You can't go out into
space with fractions.
What are you going
to land on? 1/4, 3/8?
What are you going to do
when you go
from here to Venus?
That's dialectic physics.
Dialectic logic is
there's only love and hate.
You either love somebody
or you hate them.
This is the way
the fucking world ends.
Look at this fucking
shit we're in, man!
Not with a bang...
a whimper.
And with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting, jack.
On the river,
I thought that the minute
I looked at him
I'd know what to do.
But it didn't happen.
I was in there
with him for days,
not under guard.
I was free.
But he knew
I wasn't going anywhere.
He knew more about
what I was going to do
than I did.
lf the generals
back in Nha Trang
could see what I saw,
would they stilI want me
to kill him?
More than ever, probably.
What would his people
back home want
if they learned how far
from them he'd really gone?
He broke from them,
and then he broke
from himself.
I'd never seen a man
so broken up and ripped apart.
I've seen horrors,
horrors that you've seen.
But you have no right
to call me a murderer.
You have a right
to kill me.
You have a right
to do that.
But you have no right
to judge me.
It's impossible
for words...
to describe...
what is necessary...
to those
who do not know
what horror means.
Horror.
Horror has a face...
and you must
make a friend of horror.
Horror and moral terror
are your friends.
lf they are not, then they
are enemies to be feared.
They are truly enemies.
I remember when l
was with Special Forces.
It seems
a thousand centuries ago.
We went into a camp
to inoculate some children.
We'd left the camp...
after we had inoculated
the children for polio,
and this old man
came running after us,
and he was crying.
He couldn't say--
We went back there.
They had come and hacked off
every inoculated arm.
There they were in a pile,
a pile of...little arms,
and I remember...
l--l--
I cried.
I wept like...
some...grandmother.
I wanted
to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know
what I wanted to do.
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.
I never want to forget.
And then I realized,
like I was shot,
like I was shot
with a diamond--
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead.
I thought,
"My God! The genius of that,
the genius...
the will to do that."
Perfect, genuine,
complete, crystalline, pure.
Then I realized
they were stronger than we
because they could stand it.
These were not monsters.
These were men,
trained cadres.
These men fought
with their hearts,
who have families,
who have children,
who are filled
with love,
but they had
the strength,
the strength...
to do that.
lf I had 10 divisions
of those men,
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.
You have to have men
who are moral,
and at the same time,
who are able to utilize
their primordial instincts
to kill without feeling,
without passion,
without judgment.
Without judgment.
Because it's judgment
that defeats us.
I worry that my son
might not understand
what I've tried to be,
and if I were
to be killed, Willard,
I would want someone
to go to my home
and tell my son
everything.
Everything I did,
everything you saw.
Because there's nothing
that I detest more than...
the stench of lies.
And if you understand me,
Willard, you--
you wilI do this
for me.
PBR Street Gang,
this is
Almighty, over.
PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty
standing by, over.
PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty
standing by.
How do you copy?
They were going to make me
a major for this,
and I wasn't even in
their fucking army anymore.
Everybody wanted me
to do it...
him most of all.
I felt like
he was up there,
waiting for me
to take the pain away.
He just wanted to go out
like a soldier--
Standing up.
Not like some poor wasted
rag-assed renegade.
Even the jungle
wanted him dead,
and that's who he really
took his orders from, anyway.
"We train young men
to drop fire on people,
"but their commanders
won't allow them
"to write fuck
on their airplanes
because it's obscene."
The horror.
The horror.
Calling
PBR Street Gang.
PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty.
Do you read me?
Over.
PBR Street Gang,
PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty--
The horror.
The horror.
