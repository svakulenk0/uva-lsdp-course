Red Sorghum
Adaptation of Moyan's novels:
.
I want to tell you the story
about my grandparents.
People from my town still talk about them.
but not everyone believes the story anymore.
This is my grandma.
That year, on the 9th day of the 7th moon, my grandma was married off.
To Big Head Li, a wine brewery owner at 18 Mile Slope.
Big Head Li didn't find a wife till he was fifty.
Because everyone knew
that he was a leper.
No crying or vomiting in the sedan chair, it's bad luck!
Don't take off your veil either, it brings trouble!
Get in!
According to local custom...
The sedan bearers must tease the bride.
All the chair bearers and musicians are Big Head Li's employees.
There was only one man hired for the wedding.
He was a well known sedan bearer from the area.
He later became my grandpa.
Don't peek, little lady.
If you're bored, talk with us!
It's a long trip.
Talk if you're bored, sing if you're tired.
Come on, sing!
There is no use in peeking!
Little lady...it's not easy to carry you.
Yes, not easy.
Poor girl, what a pity.
Who'd marry their own flesh to a leper for money!
She will have a painful future.
Your parents sold you for money!
Big Head Li oozes yellow pus all over.
He will never recover.
Yes, he will never recover.
You can not live with Big Head Lee.
Or you will rot, too.
Yes, you will rot, too.
It's not too late.
We can carry you back.
Just give us the word.
Come on, at least sing for us, while we sweat for you.
Not a word, huh? Let's shake her up!
Can't make her sing, at least, it'll make her piss.
Music!
The guests aren't gone.
The party isn't over.
But can't find the groom
Eager is the groom.
Rushes into the room to unveil
his bride.
Ah-ya-ya, my little darling.
A nose as flat as a pancake.
Gosh, big spots all over her face.
Chicken-skin neck, ugly face.
Hair covered with fleas.
Ah-ya-ya, my little darling.
Still silent? Let's continue.
Save me from the ugly bride.
Turn around and run.
She's now crashing into my thigh.
I'd rather sleep in the pig pen.
Ah-ya-ya, my little darling.
Go!
On the way to 18 Mile Slope, you pass Green Killer's Crossing.
The area is covered with wild sorghum.
No one knew where it came from.  No one harvested it.
They all say that
these are wild sorghum.
And that the place is haunted.
Stop!
Don't move!
Put down the sedan.
Money!
I'm Magic Shot Bandit.
Hand over your money or I'll shoot!
Take off your belts!
Put your belts and money here!
Go behind the sedan!
Don't look back.
Squat!
I'll shoot if you turn around!
Get out! Walk...
Go into the sorghum field.
Hurry up!
What are you looking at!? Walk!
Beat him up!
Beat him up! Beat him up!
What! Dead already?
He's not Magic Shot Bandit.
The gun's fake too.
You have guts!
At 18 Mile Slope, the place is deserted.
And the brewery owner is a leper.
No one comes unless to buy wine.
After 3 days, the bride visits her family.
That day, grandma's father came to fetch her.
You must return to the Li family.
Big Head Li is generous.
He gave us the big black mule.
So you didn't want him.
But why take out the scissors?
You must go back to your husband.
Daughter, why are you going so fast?
Where were you?
Did you go to the toilet?
Girl, go and just go bravely.
Hey sister, go forward boldly.  Go forward! Don't look back.
Hey sister, go forward boldly.
Don't turn around.
... go build yourself a red silk tower.
Toss that red silk bouquet and I'll catch it.
What a big red bouquet.
It hits me on my head.
Let's drink sorghum wine together.
Hey you singer! Get out of there.
What kind of perverted tune...
are you singing anyway.
Hey sister, go forward boldly.
Go forward. Don't look back.
Eat something!  Why don't you eat?
Don't you know how lucky you are?
Look at Big Head Li's wealth!  And the mule he gave us!
Eat! Then go back to him.
When he dies, everything will be yours.
What else do you want from life?
You belong to him now.
Eat! Then you've got to go!
Fine, I'm going!
I don't want a father like you.
You traded me for a mule! Go live with your mule.
I'm going, and I'm never coming back!
Disowning your father!  You little bitch! Not so easy!
Your ma and I had a hard time raising you...
while grandma was quarreling with her father.
Big head-Li was murdered at 18 Mile Slope.
No one knew who killed him.
I always thought grandpa did it.
But I never had a chance to ask him before he died.
We'd better leave, and find work elsewhere.
This leper house is jinxed anyway.
That woman brought nothing but trouble.
It's very strange.
Big Head Lie just disappeared...
the front door was locked.
His pipe was still on the bed.
I heard they found his shoes at Green Killer's Crossing.
He was probably murdered there!
No one knew what happened at Green Killer's Crossing.
The county sent two investigators...they didn't find anything!
Who could have done it?
Big Head Li never did anyone any good.  His enemies did it.
No money was stolen...
they only wanted him dead.
That woman...she didn't waste any time!
On the wedding day, she and the sedan bearer were eyeing each other.
What's it to us?  Tomorrow we'll pack and leave.
See no evil, hear no evil.
Come in.
I haven't got my pants on.
Eggy's dad, are you still drinking?
Scolding your husband again?
Go to sleep!
I just saw that woman sitting alone in the courtyard.
It's an eerie sight.
Send her to us! We'll have some fun!
Behave yourself!
She's afraid of the house...afraid to catch leprosy.
Boss!?
Sorghum wine can cure all sickness.
Don't go!
I want to talk to you.  We can't close down the brewery.
Brother Laohan.
Brother Laohan, you were here the longest.
You manage things around here.
I am just a woman, I need your help.
If you really want to go, I won't force you to stay.
You'll get this month's wages, too.
Whenever you want to come back,
you'll have a job waiting.
Please stay.
If we do well, you'll get a share of the profit!
Is that acceptable?
All right! We'll all stay.
We'll stay boss.
Listen to him.
Let's stay here.
Don't call me "boss," I'm from a poor family also.
We're all equals here.
I am the ninth child, born on the 9th day of the 9th moon.
So, call me Jiu'er , like everyone else.
Jiu'er.
Boss...shall we clean the yard today?  No one dared to go to the backyard.
They're afraid of leprosy.
You're the boss...tell us what to do.
Tell us, Jiu'er
We'll obey your order, Jiu'er.
Alright, let's clean everything in the next 3 days.
Sweep the house for me.
Anything the old boss touched, we'll burn or bury it.
Brother Luohan, buy some lime.
Let's repaint the yard.
Pour wine over the house and Eighteen Mile Slope three times.
Didn't you say that sorghum wine cures all sickness?
May it cure bad luck too!
These keys were boiled three times.
What's mine is yours too.  Keep them.
It was in the sorghum fields.
I can walk by myself.
I've told you already, remember?
Tell us what happened afterwards!
Then I laid her down on the sorghum...
And she made me v-e-r-y happy!
Stop teasing him.
Get out!
That's right, listen to the man.  No need to walk with me.
We're not far from home.
No, I'll sleep there.
From now on, I'm sleeping there
-This will be my room.
-That's the boss's room.
Boss? Who's the boss?
You mean Big Head Li?
Who is fucking big head-Lee?
Let me tell you.  I'm not afraid of him, alive or dead!
That woman is mine.
Mine.
She's my wife, because she likes me.
She told me in the sorghum field.  She likes me, she said.
That's true, isn't it?  You said you liked me.
She's pretending; she wants me to go in.
All you can go back.
Go back.
This man is drunk, get him out!
Push him down.
Hold him.
You bitch! You only want me when your pants are down!
How can you disavow our relationship?
I want to sleep in that room.
Shut up!
Oh, it feels good.
Boss, don't be angry.
Get him out of here.
I haven't finished. I...
I can't go.
Throw him into the pot.
Eggy's mom, bring his belongings.
Leave the cover off! I can't breathe.
Let me out.
Bandits! Magic Shot Bandit!
Did Big Head-Li sleep with you?
Yes.
Fuck.
My grandpa stayed in the pot for 3 days.
Magic Shot kidnapped my grandma.  He sent a message.
If ransom isn't paid...
he'll dump the body at Green Killer's Crossing.
Jiu'er is back.
Who?
Luohan, you are back.
Jiu-er.
Bring me some wine!
Is everyone dead around here?
Anything to go with the wine?
Only a cow's head.
I want beef.
Just a cow's head.
Damn the wretched head.
I want beef.
Eat what we have or get out.
You dare talk to me like that?!
I won't leave till I get beef.
Sit tight.
Someone like you wants beef?  The beef is for Magic Shot Bandit.
A piece of silver.
I only have three coppers.
A piece of silver!
Damn! Three pieces of copper!
Trying to rip me off?
It's fine if you don't want my money.
Just you wait!
Wait for what?
What's up?
Boss, this guy tried to rip me off.
Cut off his tongue to go with my wine.
I just got a bit drunk.
I was only joking.
Save your tongue to kiss women.
But go kowtow to the boss.
What are you waiting for?
I'm going, I'm going.
Kneel down!
Check out the place before you make a scene.
Come, have more wine.
Magic Shot, let me go, please.
I was naive, sorry for disturbing you.
I was drunk.  I was just joking.
I won't do it again.
Don't move, or I'll kill him.
Don't move
Brother, we've never met, why this?
You ruined my woman!
Your woman?
The one from the brewery?
Yes, did you?
No, I didn't.  I only got 3000 pieces of silver.
You're lying!
No, I didn't.
I don't touch women who've slept with lepers.
Believe me, brother,
or you can have my head.
Hold it!
Boss, he's not with any gangs.
Why don't we just boil him?
I don't want to dirty my shop.
Come on, move to the door.
Are you afraid to die?
Magic Shot, you're a coward!
I let you go.
Now you dare kill me!
Thank God for Brother Luohan.
He raised the ransom money.
At least you got back alive.
Boss, are you alright?
Today is the 9th day of the 9th moon.
We'll make the new wine of the season.
Come and take a look.
It'll take your mind off things.
It's a good idea.
I've never been to the brewery
Brother Luohan, don't call me boss anymore.
Only you keep calling me that.
Yes, boss.
The boss is here!  Behave yourselves.
No one is a stranger here.
No. Eggy's father, cover yourself.
How is the water?
Not quite ready.
The wine is made here.
Cold water is poured from the top.
Wine comes out from the bottom.
The wine flows down when
the steam meets the cold water
Let me try!
Go ahead.
It's heavy
Jiu'er, sit down
This time, I'll find out how sorghum is made into wine!
More cold water
Coming!
Hotter!
Cold water!
Coming!
Fire! Quick!
The new wine is ready.
To the wine God!
The best wine is made by us on the
Good wine made by our own hands!
Drink our wine...
you'll never catch cold!
Drink our wine...
nourish your yin and yang!
Drink our wine...
bold enough to walk Green Killer's Crossing alone!
Drink our wine...
Stand up tall in front of a king!
One, Four, Seven, Three, Six, Nine,
On the ninth day of the ninth moon. Good wine!
Boss, try the new wine!
Drink a bowl of this wine
We must all drink it.
Jiu'er, drink up!
Come on, drink it
Drink it all
You're a good drinker.
I can't drink
With practice...
I'm not like you
That's the way to drink.  Good!
So good
Good
You're back, brother.
I like that drinking style.
Have some new wine.
What are you doing?
Wait and see.
My grandpa pissed in the
wine jugs, it was meant as a joke.
But oddly enough, those jugs turned out to be
the best they ever brewed.
Boss...good news!
Boss...good news!
It's Brother Luohan.
Boss...good news.
The wine is ready.  I've been here for
more than ten years...
but never had wine so good.
Give it a name.
So people will remember it.
This place is called Eighteen Mile Slope,
we can call it "Eighteen Mile Red."
Jiu-er, I've left "Eighteen Mile
Red" at your door.
Brother Luohan left that very night.
Nine years went by quickly.
"Eighteen Mile Red" had become famous in the area.
My father was nine years old.
Everyone called my father a bastard
from the sorghum field.
Last time when I went home,
the 99 year old Granny next door said...
as an acre of sorghum only yields 9 pleats of grains,
Mum!
Mum!
Brother Luohan!
Brother Luohan!
It was Brother Luohan.
In July that year, the Japanese came.
The road they built had reached Green Killer's Crossing.
You're good at this.
Thank you.
The captain thinks well of your skills.
It's just to make a living.
The captain said one isn't enough.
He wants you to do one more.
No problem.
Over there!
Skin him!
Sir, this must be a joke.
Who's joking? Skin him!
Go!
Don't just stare!
Please, sir.
I can't do it.
The captain said if you won't do it,
we'll split your chest open.
Listen!
After flattening the sorghum field.
You're now going to watch a person
being skinned alive!
This man hanging here, look at him carefully.
Whoever fights the Japanese
will end up like him!
Finish me off quickly.
I'll forever be grateful.
Why're you taking so long?
Sir, I'll wash him with cold water first.
If I pour cold water on him first...
You're the expert.
Boss, you can't get away this time
I can't save you.
Hurry up!
You dog!
Slave of the Japanese!
Don't fall out
Bastard!
Bastard!
Damn you Japanese and your ancestors!
Spare me.  Let me go.  I can't.
I want him skinned alive!
Hurry up!
Take the knife
Do it well!  I want his skin!
Did you hear me?...I will skin you!
If you don’t hurry up, the captain says
to skin you alive.
Didn't you hear?  Hurry up!
Brother Luohan!
Spare me...
Brother, bear with me.
Bear with me.
Skin him! Quick!
Do it
According to people from my home town,
Brother Luohan joined the communists.
He helped organize the guerrillas
to fight the Japanese.
I've checked the county
registrar, it's says...
The Japanese captured over 400,000 people
to build a highway.
They destroyed rice fields and
murdered thousands.
Luohan Liu was skinned alive
in public at Green Killer's Crossing.
He showed no fear, and cursed the Japanese
till his last breath.
Beans, kneel down!
The wine was brewed by Brother Luohan.
Bow, then drink it!
If you are real men, drink this wine.
...and bomb the Japanese truck tomorrow morning
to avenge Brother Luohan's death.
Good wine brewed by our own hands.
Good wine!
Drink our wine.
You'll never catch cold.
Drink our wine.
Nourish your yin and yang!
when the fighting starts
Bold enough to walk Green Killer's Crossing
If you've drunk our wine
Stand up tall in front of a king!
One, Four, Seven, Three, Six, Nine,
on the 9th day of the 9th moon.
Good wine!
Beans, come here.
Why?
Piss into the wine.
Play the trumpet.
I only know the tune for weddings.
Which song should I trumpet?
Just play anything,
the Japanese are afraid of noise.
Just play it as loud as you can.
Has the truck arrived?
Don't just sleep,
make sure the explosions go off.
I put twice as much gunpowder in it.
It has to go off.
My dad told me...
since that day, his eyes started to hurt.
Everything he saw was red.
One year when I went home
The bridge of Green Killer Crossing
was still there, but all the sorghum was gone.
Ma!
Is the fighting over?
Not yet.
Where's your father?
They are sleeping, and getting hungry.
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
Fire the cannon, quick!
Big Zhang! Little Zhang!
It didn't go off!
Brother, let's go!
Father!
Father!
Hey sister, go forward boldly.
Don't look back. Go build yourself a red silk tower
Toss that red silk bouquet.  I'll catch it.
Let us drink that red, red sorghum wine.
That red, red sorghum wine.
Father, look!
Mother, go to heaven.
On a wide road, in a big boat.
Mother, go to heaven.
On a handsome horse, with lots of silver.
Mother, go to heaven.
Rest and leave your earthly worries behind.
Mother, go to heaven.
On a wide road, in a big boat.
Mother, go to heaven.

Rest and leave your earthly worries behind.
