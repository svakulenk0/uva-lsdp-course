l still have dreams...
...and certain things come back.
l don´t know what age l am,
but life is quite normal.
Whatever we´re doing
is an everyday happening.
And this is when l wake up.
And as old as l am, l´m still sobbing.
ln 1933, few of the Jewish families...
...who lived in Germany, Austria and
Czechoslovakia foresaw how much...
...their lives were about to change.
None of their children realized...
...how soon their childhood
was about to end.
l was a very happy little girl growing up.
My father absoIuteIy adored me.
There was never anything...
...that I couId have possibIy done wrong.
My father used to go out with me...
...shopping.
And l always used to admire this one suit...
...which was for ladies.
I was onIy a kid, you know.
And I aIways said,
"´Daddy, I wouId Iove to wear that suit."´
So, one day, he said,
"´ShaII we go in there?"´
And I said, "´That´s for big Iadies, I can´t....
"´Let´s go in there."´ And he went in there
and they took my measurements...
...and that suit was made for me.
And l came home,
and my mother was devastated.
"´What are you buying this IittIe girI
aII this stuff for?
"´She doesn´t need that."´
And my father said,
"´She is my pride and joy...
"´...and she needs everything
I can get for her."´
My parents were
sort of middle-class people.
My father was
a middle-level bank manager.
My mother was a lady of leisure.
And I was a very-much-desired first chiId.
They were both around 30 or so.
We had one of these very nice apartments
in Vienna, with a high ceiling...
...lots of light, as l remember it,
and big windows...
...and I guess I was spoiIed.
In addition to them,
there was the inevitabIe maid...
...nursemaid in the house in those days.
My grandmother Iooked in often
and Iived nearby.
lt was, in many ways, a rather idyllic life.
And I was indeed
the center of the universe.
There was my mother, father...
...and my sister,
who was four years younger than me.
We had a very happy, carefree childhood.
My father was aIways busy
during the week...
...but when he was home,
he often took me for waIks.
By the river mostly.
And we talked about everything.
That brought us probabIy cIoser.
l always felt that my father and l
were protecting my mother and sister.
I don´t know
what we were protecting them from.
I was about 8 years oId...
...when HitIer came to power.
l had got some school friends...
...and my mother tried to make
a birthday party for us.
The tabIe was set.
I was very excited.
Nobody came.
Not a singIe chiId
came to this birthday party.
That was the first...
...terribIe bIow to me.
I know it sounds triviaI...
...but it was the first
sort of comprehension for a chiId...
...to understand that you´re ostracized.
That there´s something different about you.
For Jewish children...
...life under Hitler became increasingly
isolated and threatening.
While the Nazis stripped their parents
of their jobs and citizenship...
...the children were gradually barred
from schools...
...parks, theaters, and swimming pools.
l was overprotected because of...
...the Hitler dangers outside the home.
But very much loved in the home.
My mother sitting on my father
for a cuddIe...
...was an everyday occurrence.
I had to join in,
or eIse I wouId have been jeaIous.
He had to have both of us on his Iap.
My father used to say:
´´l´m too old to start again. ´´
Although he spoke perfect English...
...he felt he was just not young enough
to start in a new country.
And the other sentence,
which was because...
...his father and grandfather, and so on...
...were born in Germany was:
"´This has got to change.
"´This madman, HitIer, can´t possibIy Iast."´
l feared every day.
I was most unhappy going to schooI.
l was walking down the street...
...six or seven boys came,
called me ´´Jew bastard´´...
...and then attacked me and threw me
through a plate-glass window.
I was cut severeIy...
...and I had to go
to the hospitaI for stitches.
I didn´t want to go
to the schooI there anymore.
I just feIt that I was threatened constantIy.
As Hitler strengthened his control...
...he began looking for opportunities
to extend Germany´s power...
...beyond its borders.
ln March, 1938...
...German troops entered Austria...
...and without firing a single shot...
...annexed the country to the Reich.
The first thing that happens
when a disaster strikes...
...is that nothing changes.
You think there´s going to be
some great drama...
...and you go to put your nightgown on...
...and you say the Shema to your mother
and then you go to bed.
And you think, "´Oh, this isn´t so terribIe."´
But the next morning, my parents
took me downstairs into the street.
The streets were full of new uniforms
l´d never seen.
And the young people wore the red bands
around their arms with the swastika.
l didn´t know what that meant.
And they were stretching out their arms
in the Hitler salute.
And there were flags everywhere,
these new red flags...
...with the white circle
and the black swastika.
My main sense
of something being wrong...
...was the haste with which my parents
got me back into the house.
Suddenly l couldn´t go
to my normal school anymore.
l was sent off to a makeshift school...
...at the end of the tramline.
And I did it aIone, even at age 7.
I went to the end of the Iine, and I wouId
just waIk on untiI I came to this house.
Word got back to my parents that while
on the tram, l was a very talkative boy.
l told them all the bad things
that Herr Hitler was doing.
I thought that "´Herr"´ was his first name,
of course.
And word got back to my parents
that maybe...
...I shouIdn´t be traveIing aIone.
And my father then came with me.
He didn´t say much, he hardIy ever did...
...but he Iet it be known...
...that it wasn´t wise to go around
saying bad things about HitIer.
ln the weeks following
the annexation of Austria...
...Nazi authorities had enacted
all the anti-Jewish laws...
...it had taken Hitler five years
to put into place in Germany.
For anyone coming from Vienna,
it was very dramatic.
The reality of it struck me
when my parents talked about...
...giving up the apartment,
that we had to Ieave.
That was something,
you know, the bottom faIIs out.
Everything faIIs out of you.
This is all l knew...
...and we had to give it up,
we had to leave.
That was probably the biggest blow l had.
Just the idea...
...it´II aII end the way it is.
My mother was an activist.
She knew something had to be done.
The decision was to go...
...to England to be hired...
...as a domestic, because the English
would take young women...
...who would not interfere
with the labor market.
The pIan was:
She wouId go ahead. She´d try...
...to get me and my father out.
This is the time when l remember...
...there was no conversation
among the grown-ups...
...except how to get out of Vienna.
It´s interesting because we´re now asked,
"´How come you didn´t Ieave?"´
And when I think
of what it meant to Ieave...
...how impossibIe it was to Ieave.
First of all, you had to have a sponsor...
...in the country you were going to.
Someone who would promise you would
not become a burden on the government.
You would have to get a visa
from the state department...
...or the government to be allowed in.
Then you had to get an exit permit
from the Nazis.
All these things had to come together.
And they had a time span
in which they would expire.
You had to collect all these things together
so that they would be ready.
And it usually didn´t happen.
The hardest thing
was to find a country to go to.
The countries under discussion were:
Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Venezuela...
...Shanghai, Cuba, the Dominican Republic.
l remember going with my father
to the American consulate.
There was a queue around the block...
...up the stairs...
...and around the room.
We are now in the late summer of 1938.
I got to the United States on May 1, 1951 .
It was a 13-year...
...quota for us.
German troops
had barely entered Austria...
...when Hitler demanded the annexation
of Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia.
He insisted that the province...
...which was home
to over three million ethnic Germans ...
...be allowed to secede and join the Reich.
On October 1,
with international agreement...
...German troops
marched into Sudetenland...
...adding one-fifth of Czechoslovakia
to the Reich...
...and opening the way
for further dismemberment of the country.
From then on, people were wondering...
...what would happen next.
Father was an optimist because...
...he did business with people in France
who wrote and said:
´´lt´s going to be bad, get out. ´´
But for Father, no,
things Iike that wouIdn´t happen.
He had a greater faith in mankind.
He used to say that he wouId rather
trust peopIe and be disappointed...
...than go through Iife
not trusting anybody.
Less than half a year later...
...Hitler would destroy the Czech state.
But now, the Nazis continued
their persecution of the Jews.
ln November,
they orchestrated a vicious pogrom...
...which they later called KristaIInacht:
´´The Night of Broken Glass. ´´
l had had a strange dream in the night...
...that my father was being arrested.
Our evening meaI that evening...
...was the Iast meaI
I ever remember having with my father.
I Iooked at him...
...and l thought, well, l hadn´t really...
...seen his features properly.
You know
how you Iook at somebody intenseIy?
And something toId me...
...that I must imprint
that image of him in my mind.
Before l went to bed...
...my father, in a rather stern voice,
said to me:
"´If you hear any strange noises
during the night...
"´...immediateIy get out of bed...
´´...and go into that wardrobe
in the hallway. ´´
And l said, ´´l don´t understand. ´´
And quite differently than my father...
...wouId normaIIy answer my questions,
he said:
"´Don´t ask any questions,
just do as you´re toId."´
l was woken up at 2:00 a.m.
Terrible banging on the door.
There were two...
...Nazis at the door...
...shouting, "´You´re aII under arrest!
Put some cIothes on and come with us! "´
l remember that it was a very cold...
...very dark night. We all went off...
...to an assembly point,
which was like a big square.
And there were just...
...thousands of other Jews.
And l mean thousands.
And there were people l knew
and people l didn´t know.
And people getting beaten up.
And people crying.
l think everybody was petrified.
I aIso remember very vividIy
that they were beating up the rabbi.
And they had fetched the Torahs
out of the synagogue.
And I think they were trampIing on them.
l took my bicycle
and went to school as always.
There was no Jewish business
that l passed...
...that wasn´t broken into.
The merchandise was either on the street...
...or looted completely.
As I got cIoser to schooI...
...I saw huge piIIars of smoke...
...coming from the sections...
...where the two big synagogues
in Frankfurt were.
And l saw that they were on fire.
Our schooI happened to be just opposite
on the street where the synagogue was.
l was dragged out
with the stream of children.
Everybody went to the playground...
...to watch these flames.
And suddenly somebody said:
"´There´s a Jew!
Let´s throw her on the fire as weII! "´
l don´t know how l got home.
l still don´t know today how l got home.
And when I got home
my mother was absoIuteIy shocked.
My father had been arrested.
My father was quite an outspoken person.
When they came to Buchenwald...
...and they took away
all the men´s braces and shoelaces...
...he protested and said,
´´You can´t treat these old people like this. ´´
So they made an exampIe of him.
They beat him to death...
...in front of everybody...
...in order to instiII terror and obedience.
They offered us my father´s ashes
in return for money...
...and eventually the urn came.
And we buried it in the Jewish cemetery.
Of course, whether it was his ashes,
one never knows.
We heard loud banging
on the door downstairs...
...and so my aunt, my mother and l...
...ran up into the attic.
We were hiding
in an old wardrobe up there.
And I do remember feeIing
as though I had spent my entire Iife...
...in that wardrobe.
And I aIso remember
whispering to my mother:
"´I want to get out of here,
and not just out of this wardrobe...
"´...I want to get out of Germany."´
World revulsion was swift.
Yet Britain was the only country
willing to relax its immigration controls.
But only for children who would not
threaten British jobs or public funds.
Days after the Nazi pogrom...
...Anglo-Jewish leaders
met with Prime Minister Chamberlain ...
...and urged him to let into the country
unaccompanied children...
...Christian as well as Jewish...
...up to the age of 1 7.
Six days later,
Quakers joined Jewish leaders...
...to present the government
a concrete rescue plan...
...to be funded by refugee
and religious organizations.
That night, the House of Commons
debated the issue...
...and approved the plan.
My youth leader said:
´´Call Otto Hirsch.
´´There is a job for you to be done. ´´
So l went and saw him, and he said:
"´I have a request.
"´We have been informed...
"´...that the British government,
the House of Commons...
"´...had discussed the destiny
of Jews in Germany after...
"´...aII this pubIicity...
"´...and they are disgusted."´
´´They came to the conclusion...
´´...to accept children for a certain time.
´´We have an office for the operations.
"´See what you can do."´
As the transports got underway
in Germany and Austria...
...thousands of Sudetenland refugees
continued to flee to Prague.
English stockbroker Nicholas Winton...
...was summoned by a friend
to view the situation for himself.
He toured refugee camps
with Doreen Warriner...
...a representative of the British Committee
for Refugees from Czechoslovakia.
We did have the feeIing
that the position was much more urgent...
...than anybody in London thought.
Doreen Warriner said, ´´l don´t know
what we will do about the children. ´´
Almost spontaneously l said,
´´Well, when l get back to England...
´´...l find that the Home Office
will allow them in...
´´...we´ll try and get some of them
into England. ´´
And when l went to the Home Office,
they said:
´´Under certain conditions, you can bring in
as many children as you like. ´´
We had to produce...
...somebody who´d guarantee €50
against their re-immigration...
...which is about €1,000 today.
It was quite a Iot of money.
And then I had to find a famiIy
who´d take each individuaI chiId.
lt certainly wasn´t easy,
but it wasn´t that difficult.
lt´s easier to get somebody
to take a child than to take a grown-up.
l tried to get America involved...
...and wrote to a lot of the senators...
...and got a Iot of answers
saying how concerned they were...
...and aII the reasons
why they couIdn´t do anything.
ln the United States...
...a congressional bill
to admit 20,000 child refugees...
...died in committee.
One of the arguments against the bill...
...was that accepting children
without their parents...
...was contrary to the laws of God.
My father said:
´´Mommy and l cannot leave,
but you´re going to leave. ´´
I said, "´What do you mean,
I´m going to Ieave?"´
"´You´re going to EngIand,"´ he said.
"´When?"´
"´Thursday,"´ he said.
I knew...
...that she ought to go...
...that I ought to send her away...
...but I couIdn´t imagine
giving permission for her to go.
My husband said, "´She must go."´
He didn´t Iisten to me.
He just arranged everything for her.
And l had to give in, and l saw in the end...
...that he was right.
But the hurt is unbeIievabIe.
That cannot be described.
My father died when l was 3 years old.
My mother had to go out to work...
...so l wound up in the orphanage.
When Polish Jews were arrested
all over Germany...
...I´d found out
that my mother was deported.
I was on my own.
I had nobody, no one, nothing.
l went to the Gemeinde.
There was this wonderful woman
who knew me there.
She said,
"´Pascha, what are you doing here?
"´Where´s your mother?"´
I said, "´My mother´s been deported."´
And she said to me,
"´There´s something happening now.
´´l think you should get onto it. ´´
lt was the Kindertransport.
She said, "´You´d better register
immediateIy because you´re by yourseIf.
"´What wiII you do?"´
So I said, "´Okay. I´II go to EngIand."´
Just Iike matter of fact,
as if it was nothing.
ln hindsight...
...l think my sister and l...
...we owe it to my father´s death...
...that we have survived...
...because they seIected...
...chiIdren...
...who had probIems...
...who´d Iost parents...
...or whose parents
couId no Ionger Iook after them...
...to go on the Kindertransport.
Mother came home
and said that she´d enrolled us.
About a fortnight later...
...my parents were toId that I couId go.
A week or two after that...
...my parents decided my sister couId go.
Now both of us wouId go.
That must have been very hard.
That wouId have been hard to decide
that we wouId both go.
We had about a fortnight before we left.
lnto that fortnight,
both Mother and Father...
...were trying to give their instructions
and guidance...
...that they hoped
to have their whole lives to give.
My bar mitzvah was
a month after ´´Crystal Night. ´´
lt was held in an attic.
My father was not there,
he was still in a concentration camp.
lt was just my mother.
l felt terrible.
There was no ceIebration afterwards.
There was nothing.
You read your part from the Torah, and...
...you did your haftorah
and you were finished.
And we were Iucky that a minyan...
...showed up aItogether.
l certainly felt...
...that the sooner we left Germany...
...the better off we would be.
My housemother wrote...
...to Baron James de Rothschild...
...asking if he would take...
...24 of her boys...
...her husband, herself...
...and her two daughters.
And he wrote back in January that...
...he wouId.
We thought of England...
...as a land of lords and ladies because...
...of the King and Queen,
and the two little princesses...
...appealed to us very much.
We saw their pictures in the newspapers.
The coronation with their ermine clothes
and crowns on their heads.
And we reaIIy thought that in EngIand
that´s how peopIe dressed.
Perhaps not every day,
but sometimes on Sundays.
So that was our expectation of EngIand.
I was toId this was the best thing
that couId happen, and I was so Iucky...
...because everybody around me
was trying to find pIaces...
...for their chiIdren.
And, suddenIy, out of the bIue...
...I had a chance to come to EngIand.
How lucky can l be?
My parents said
l´d be able to go back to school...
...l will learn another language...
...l will live in London,
l will be able to travel on the subway....
And painted a beautiful picture.
And added, again and again:
´´And we´ll follow soon. ´´
However, a few days or so...
...before I was to Ieave...
...I accused my parents
of trying to get rid of me.
l said to my parents,
´´l´m really a gypsy child...
´´...and now you´re trying to get rid of me.
You adopted me...
´´...and now you no longer want me. ´´
I must have reaIIy, deepIy,
deepIy hurt my parents.
Since German policy in 1938
was to force Jewish emigration...
...the Nazis willingly let
the children leave...
...as long as they did not take
any valuables with them.
Each child was allowed one suitcase...
...one piece of hand luggage...
...and ten reichsmark.
We had four days...
...to pack and go.
My parents were so busy getting ready
the things l was going to take...
...that l don´t think they nor l had time...
...to think about what was happening.
My mother prepared all our clothes.
She lovingly embroidered our names...
...on every piece of clothing,
even every handkerchief...
...every sock...
...everything.
l think l took my teddy bear.
My mother...
...always slept on a little pillow
on top of her big pillow...
...and l asked her
if l could take that with me.
She said, ´´Sure. ´´
Mother had new clothes made
for both of us.
We had a dressmaker at home
who did all the sewing.
And some clothes she bought.
Otherwise, around my neck...
...because we were baptized,
hoping that would be...
...of some help...
...I had a IittIe cross...
...and I had a IittIe eIephant...
...and I had a sort of....
It wasn´t a Jewish star,
but it was a IittIe angeI.
I put them aII together because I thought
the AImighty couId choose...
...which reIigion
he wouId Iike me to beIong to.
So sad the things I remember.
l remember that last evening,
when all the cousins and all the aunts...
...came to say good-bye.
There was one aunt who had twins.
She was extremely angry
with my parents...
...for getting me onto this transport,
and for not having managed to get...
...her twins onto the transport.
There was grief and panic
and fury in that room.
There was a moment...
...that my father took me
between his knees...
...and he said:
"´Now, when you get to EngIand...
"´...you must taIk to aII the EngIish peopIe
you meet and you have to ask them...
"´...to get your mother and me out,
and your grandparents out."´
And because this aunt was there
and had been so unhappy...
...and so angry, he said,
"´And Aunt so-and-so´s twins."´
Before long, l had a list...
...of people whom l, at 10 years old,
had promised to save from Hitler.
The transports began in December...
...barely three weeks
after the Nazi pogrom.
Although a few children traveled by plane...
...the majority departed by train.
Some trains left during the day...
...many others in the dead of night.
Each child was given a number.
My number...
...and l still have it, was 152.
This was a number that every chiId...
...put around its neck...
...and a simiIar number
was attached to our suitcases.
There we stood, in our groups of fifty,
I think it was...
...and there was my mother and my father.
My mother kept up...
...a conversation with me
as if this was an ordinary and interesting...
...thing that was happening.
But I remember that she wore...
...a pony fur with a fox coIIar...
...and her face was inside the fox coIIar.
l remember that although...
...her speech was
as if everything was ordinary...
...her face, l remember, was hot.
lt was red and hot.
Every parent promised their child:
´´We will soon come and follow. ´´
How otherwise did the parents...
...get the little children onto the trains.
"´Give us a few weeks, when things...
"´...wiII either bIow over
and you´II come back again...
"´...or we´II come join you."´
That was a promise
every parent made to their chiId.
There came the time to say to the parents:
"´You cannot go to the pIatform.
"´The poIice wiII not aIIow it.
"´You have to say good-bye here."´
So I ascended a chair there...
...and addressed the peopIe.
Where I got the courage to do that,
I don´t know.
But l told the parents:
´´This is your last good-bye. ´´
They didn´t want the German public
to know what was going on...
...because they had experiences...
...of parents weeping and...
...fainting at the platform.
So we had to say good-bye...
...groups had to say good-bye,
in an anteroom.
The scenes were pretty horrendous.
When my sister and brother left...
...all the other parents were crying bitterly.
I was so afraid.
I didn´t want my mother to cry...
...because she was a very strong person.
l thought, ´´lf she cries...
´´...terrible things will happen. ´´
I kept on Iooking at her, and I said,
"´Don´t cry. You won´t cry."´ And she didn´t.
l got to the station,
which was crowded with people.
All the children had parents with them...
...and I was sitting there aII by myseIf.
I had no parents. Nobody.
I was just there with a suitcase.
There was nobody´s shoulder
l could cry on.
All l knew was l was going away.
I was going to EngIand.
Whatever wouId happen wouId happen.
Every day my father said:
´´Pupela, l don´t want you to go.
´´But l want you to go
because it´ll be good for you. ´´
The day came and we went.
My mother and dad
went with me inside the train...
...and put my suitcase up.
My seat was right at the window.
The German trains
had great big windows...
...and my father pulled that
all the way down...
...so l could be leaning out of the window.
He hugged and kissed me.
I couId see my father´s face getting...
...whiter and whiter.
l thought, ´´l only hope nothing
is going to happen to him. ´´
He looked so terribly, terribly pale.
My poor mother
was getting worse and worse.
l couldn´t wait for the train to go because...
...l didn´t want to remember that.
The guy came...
...and he waved the signal.
When the train started to go...
...my father says, "´PupeIa!
Let me hoId your hands! "´
And I heId my hands and said,
"´I have to Iet go! I have to Iet go! "´
"´No! I don´t want you to go!
I don´t want you to go! "´
And we were aIready....
My father couIdn´t waIk very fast...
...because he waIked with a cane.
We went a IittIe bit more...
...and he took me by my hands...
...and he puIIed me out of the window.
And I feII.
I couId have faIIen in-between...
...the pIatform and the train.
There was onIy a smaII amount of space.
I didn´t, but I got hurt and I was bIeeding...
...and I was devastated.
AbsoIuteIy devastated.
And my father was in seventh heaven...
...that he had his IittIe PupeIa,
his IittIe girI, back.
The parting was terrible.
That´s the one thing l have never...
...forgotten in all my life.
And she had been so controlled.
She´d always been...
...a sort of solid...
...support to us.
And suddenly she showed her feelings...
...and it was terrifying, really terrifying.
We saw this face...
...which showed aII the hurt...
...and agony she´d been through.
And l can still see my father that mealtime.
But l would have liked to have had
a happier image of my mother.
That´s the onIy image...
...of this contorted...
...face...
...fuII of agony.
It was very sad.
l remember standing by the window
and waving good-bye...
...and just trying hard to believe...
...that we really would come back.
That it won´t be for very long.
But when the train moved
and they disappeared from sight...
...both Vera and I
cried in each other´s arms.
My parents ran along the train...
...on the pIatform.
And I stiII remember, sort of in my head...
...I heard that refrain,
"´You´re Ieaving! You´re Ieaving! "´
I watched their faces.
Tears were streaming down their faces...
...down their cheeks.
And I knew then...
...these peopIe reaIIy Iove me.
This is why they´re sending me away.
l immediately started to write
to my parents.
And l apologized
for what l had said to them...
...that they were trying to get rid of me.
ln no time...
...the suitcase was gone.
The child was gone.
The other children were gone.
Just emptiness.
Then we turned around and went home.
I did not taIk.
It was awfuI.
The children went with the hope
that the parents would follow, or that...
...one day they could come back
and see them again.
l did not realize...
...and l could never have realized...
...that only a year and a half later...
...from the same raiIway station...
...trains wouId go in the other direction...
...to HitIer´s sIaughterhouses.
l remember all that day we sang songs.
We ate the things
that our mothers had given us.
When we got to the border...
...it got very frightening because...
...the train stopped at the last station...
...before Holland.
The big girIs were very frightened
and they scared us.
They said, "´Don´t move."´
You know what happens when you sit
and don´t move? You begin to trembIe...
...if you tense yourseIf enough.
I remember that...
...I was sitting there so tense
that I was vibrating.
The Nazi border guard...
...very officiously came around...
...and made some of the children
open their suitcases.
They shouted at us...
...and threw their weight about.
They were Iooking for
new things peopIe had.
ChiIdren had new cIothes and things.
They didn´t Iike that.
They gave the chiIdren a tough time.
Children kept crying and crying.
We were there quite a while.
They took their time
and enjoyed doing what they did to us.
Then suddenIy we were in HoIIand.
Everyone was cheering:
"´Those damn Nazis!
They shouId drop dead! Now we are free! "´
There was howling, yelling, shouting,
and singing.
lt was the best party l´ve ever been at...
...although l didn´t really understand
what was happening.
I was hoIding a big girI around the waist,
and she was hoIding me.
They knew the songs they were singing.
They were probabIy Zionist songs...
...but I sang aIong
because it was so much fun...
...to be part of this party.
Not only were the frontier guards
on the Dutch side very nice...
...they had a contingent...
...of ladies who brought us cocoa...
...and Dutch zwieback.
It was Iike manna from heaven.
It was wonderfuI.
You suddenIy feIt
as though you´d been cIad...
...in a cIoak of Iead or iron...
...and it had been taken from you.
It was a wonderfuI feeIing of freedom.
We started to smile.
l don´t think any of them
had smiled for a long time.
lt was wonderful.
Then the train went on
to Hoek van Holland.
We got onto the boat...
...which took us to Harwich.
lt was an unpleasant trip because...
...the EngIish ChanneI...
...is one of the worst pIaces
in wintertime to cross.
We had small children
and people got seasick.
lt was some how-do-you-do.
l have a very vivid memory of waking up...
...and seeing the sea for the first time,
with the sunrise on it...
...and thinking how beautifuI it was.
lt was only the British Channel...
...but it seemed
a long way from home in 1939.
And so, it was a mixture...
...of eIation because we saw something
so beautifuI, and saw the sea, whiIe this...
...fear within me, which never Ieft me
for those six years, of:
"´What´s going to happen...
"´...at home?"´
Refugees from terror.
The first boatload from Nazi Germany.
Vanguard of an army of helpless children.
Uprooted from their homeland
in a modern exodus.
Each Kindertransport
was lead by adult escorts...
...on the condition that
after delivering the children...
...all escorts would return home...
...or else the transports would be ended.
A couple of times l traveled with them.
At one transport the customs official...
...checked and said, ´´We have a problem. ´´
He said, ´´This young man here
brought a violin...
´´...which is very, very expensive.
´´This is not an ordinary violin. ´´
I said, "´WeII, don´t forget...
"´...these young peopIe
take music Iessons...
"´...and obviousIy
he Iiked music very much...
"´...so he took his vioIin aIong."´
This didn´t sit weII...
...so l gambled.
l said to that boy:
´´Can you play something?´´
And he said, ´´Sure. ´´
And he was playing God Save the King.
And that boy couldn´t be stopped.
He played all three stanzas.
When he was finished...
...the guard Iooked very happy.
I asked the feIIow, "´Are you now
convinced, sir, that he Iikes music?"´
And he said, "´Yes! "´
So, the boy got his vioIin into EngIand.
Then came the arrival...
...at Liverpool Street Station.
Everyone was being picked up...
...and l wasn´t.
l remember sitting
in an enormous arrival hall.
And l just sat.
Nobody came to me, nobody taIked to me.
I think I must have sat for an hour.
Maybe longer, l don´t know.
Then came two people...
...who were my guardians...
...and they introduced themseIves.
They expIained that they Iived in LincoIn.
They didn´t speak one word of German...
...and I didn´t speak one word of EngIish.
If they said, "´LincoIn,"´
that couId have been...
...anywhere.
Never heard of the pIace.
My mother sent me off saying:
´´Whoever is going to be good enough
to take you in...
´´...and give you a home...
´´...you must treat as a temporary mother. ´´
When we arrived back
from LiverpooI Street...
...and we aII went to bed...
...in the evening...
...I went up to her,
put my arms around her...
...and she pushed me away.
And her words were, "´That´s sissy."´
She may have said something eIse Iike,
"´We don´t do this, that´s sissy."´
But the words "´That´s sissy"´
have never Ieft me.
The children arrived in England
at the rate of about 300 a week.
Those who were not already placed
in foster homes...
...were taken to temporary centers...
...hastily set up in summer holiday camps...
...like Dovercourt.
They did try and keep us busy.
The memorable part
of this camp experience was...
...that it was one
of the coldest winters in history.
We all went for breakfast to this big hall.
The snow came in through the cracks.
We had this curious food. We had kippers.
What IittIe Austrian-Jewish chiId
has ever heard of kippers?
Here was this saIty,
shoe Ieather on our pIates...
...and it had snow on it. It was interesting.
While we were sitting...
...around the stove,
always with our coats on...
...and with our little gloves on...
...groups of people would come...
...to choose children
to take away with them.
We called it the ´´Cattle Market´´...
...because every Saturday and Sunday...
...we were told to put on our best clothes...
...and visitors used to come.
We feIt a bit Iike...
...the monkeys in the zoo.
We were being stared at and evaIuated.
PeopIe were chosen, taken away
from the tabIes, and interviewed...
...if you were suitable
to be taken to their families.
Most families...
...wanted little blue-eyed and blonde girls...
...of about three to seven.
Little boys were accepted as well.
And the older children found it
a bit more difficult...
...to find foster parents.
Of course, by that time,
they hastiIy estabIished hosteIs...
...to take a big infIux of the chiIdren...
...who weren´t chosen quickIy,
because we had to be chosen fast.
ln and out, the camp was filled.
Every week,
another transport would arrive.
l was writing a letter to my parents...
...and one of these ladies in a fur coat...
...bent down to me and asked me...
...if l would like to come to Liverpool.
I said, "´Yes, I wouId Iike
to come to LiverpooI."´
She said to the other woman,
"´Oh, she speaks EngIish."´
By speaking EngIish, I mean,
I couId understand:
"´WouId you Iike to come to LiverpooI?"´
And I couId say "´Yes."´
Then they said to me, "´Are you Orthodox?"´
I said, "´Yes."´
They wrote that down.
lt was understood that l was going to go
to Liverpool the next day...
...and when the ladies had gone...
...I wrote in my Ietter to my parents,
"´By the way, what is Orthodox?"´
My brother had been chosen first...
...to be the playmate
of a little boy in Coventry.
Then they asked me if l´d like to go
to a family there.
Of course, l jumped at the chance.
l wanted to be near my little brother.
They chose me as a maid, but I didn´t know
I was supposed to be a maid.
l hadn´t ever thought
of becoming a servant.
But I drew the Iine.
I point bIank refused to wear a uniform.
I think they took me
to show off in front of the neighbors...
...because they were working-cIass peopIe.
The culture shock was very great...
...and also the fact that my clothes
were better than hers.
She took great exception to that...
...and she took the clothes and all.
The chiIdren whom we brought over
and pIaced...
...I think, in the main, were satisfactory.
One can never cIaim 100 percent.
There were certainIy some who weren´t.
There were certainIy some
who were misused...
...and used as servants
if they were of the right age.
l wouldn´t claim that it was
a 100-percent success, but...
...I wouId cIaim that everybody
who came was aIive at the end of the war.
You felt you wanted to do something.
There was a meeting in Norwich...
...of a few Jewish congregates,
and non-Jewish.
They said, "´Any offers to take chiIdren?"´
My husband and I said yes.
Then some photographs
were handed around.
I remember there were some boy twins.
My heart ached,
but we couIdn´t afford it in those days.
We didn´t know what was going to happen.
So that´s when...
...we took Kurt.
Percy and Mariam...
...picked me up at the boat...
...and took me back home.
At the entrance stood...
...the maid who, I wouId Iearn Iater,
actuaIIy ran the househoId...
...and haIfway up the stairs
sat a IittIe boy of five...
...Iooking at his "´new"´ brother.
When we got home,
my maid, SeIena, was there...
...and she said to me,
"´Can´t we change it?"´
He was fiIthy, you know, and smeIt...
...of sick and everything.
Anyhow, we gave him a bath.
My grubby clothes,
after three days of travel, were torn off me.
Burned, l learnt later.
l was scrubbed from head to toe...
...and then dressed in English clothes.
Then the famiIy got together
for a chicken dinner.
That I remember.
That´s a Ianguage I couId understand.
And I started to feeI more at ease.
l learned English...
...by being sent to a German man,
rather old...
...who lived a few houses down
the same street.
Maybe I thought he was a Nazi...
...but I was terrified of him.
In fact, I was so terrified that I Iearned...
...EngIish so quick
so I wouIdn´t have to see him again.
Then six weeks Iater...
...I wrote to my parents in EngIish:
"´I no Ionger speak German."´
I never have,
and I´ve never been abIe to re-Iearn it.
He was very, very good.
He liked the sweet things
and John liked the savory, but...
...they got on very well together.
But I noticed, weII, we knew every night...
...when it was dark,
he´d come down the stairs...
...and he´d see that the door was Iocked.
That was one thing I remember.
My mother was in London,
so for me the separation...
...was not as traumatic
because l was going to something.
l came to the London station...
...and she picked me up
and took me where she was working.
Then I stayed in this very coId...
...fancy house in EngIand...
...where they were expIoiting
the European maids.
And, of course,
if you´ve ever been the chiId of a maid...
...you know maids
aren´t supposed to have chiIdren.
They´re not weIcome. You can´t stay there.
l don´t know how the decision was made,
but l was to be sent to Belfast...
...to the Jewish refugee hostel in Belfast.
When you see your life has been saved
and you´re brought into a hostel...
...which is clean...
...and there is food there...
...and other children there,
how could you not be happy in that place?
But, to me...
...it smeIIed of orphanage,
which, in due course, it became.
And orphanages...
...those things frighten
every chiId out of its wits.
I mean, CharIes Dickens...
...to be in a workhouse, to be an orphan.
My first impression of Waddesdon Manor
was like a dream...
...like a castle l´ve seen in pictures...
...but never in person.
The Cedars was a servants´ house.
Twenty-six of us lived in The Cedars.
The first thing we did
was throw a soccer ball on the lawn...
...and kicked it around.
The local boys wanted to see what was,
all of a sudden...
...being brought into their little village.
When it was time for dinner...
...they said:
"´We´II see you tomorrow."´
I was so excited.
I was absoIuteIy so exuberant.
I ran to my housemother...
...and toId her:
"´Somebody who´s not Jewish
wants to see me tomorrow."´
We did start going to school there.
lt was marvelous.
l never realized
what school was really like.
That you couId participate.
And I did enjoy going to schooI.
And the wonderfuI part about it
was that it had a Iibrary.
l waded through that library...
...and that´s how l learned
to speak English.
Through that
I got a Iove of EngIish Iiterature.
But aItogether...
...it was a wonderfuI experience,
and the chiIdren were so friendIy to us.
l knew that l was going...
...to a school near Bournemouth in Dorset.
lt was the headmistress of the school
who guaranteed...
...to look after me.
When l arrived at the school,
it was all these girls...
...who were very polite...
...and very nice, very kind.
I couIdn´t understand a word they said.
I was given my bed.
The curtains couId be drawn,
to give me some privacy.
The first thing I did was...
...put a picture of my parents
on the bedside table...
...so l could say goodnight to them.
The first three months
before war broke out...
...we couId stiII write home.
So I couId share my experiences
with my parents...
...and I had Ietters very frequentIy.
So I didn´t feeI quite so isoIated.
´´As you can well imagine...
´´...you have been constantly
in our thoughts.
´´We still see your face before us
in that window...
´´...of the railway carriage. ´´
´´My dearest little mouse:
´´Hopefully this letter will reach you...
´´...already in your new home,
where you surely will enjoy your stay.
´´Be a very good little girl.
´´Be obedient. ´´
´´Dear Parents:
´´How are you both?
´´Today l had my first English lesson.
´´Greetings and kisses. ´´
´´l was very happy
with your dear little letter...
´´...only there shouldn´t be
so many spelling errors! ´´
´´lf only l could see you
just for a tiny moment...
´´...but, as it is,
l can only write letters full of longing. ´´
´´Dear Daddy: Thank you very much...
´´...for the game of cards...
´´...and the brooches...
´´...and the bracelet.
´´l had a game with them. ´´
´´l keep running to the mailbox.
´´Every line from you overwhelms me.
´´Every day l thank God
that you are in such good hands...
´´...but please show your gratefulness. ´´
´´My dear, good, darling parents:
´´l feel very safe here.
´´lf only l was not so very scared...
´´...about your safety. ´´
´´For my birthday, you wrote me...
´´...that l´ll always have to be brave...
´´...because you can´t be happy if l´m not.
´´And l can assure you...
´´...that l always grit my teeth and smile. ´´
´´Your letter of yesterday
was again so sweet...
´´...and written with so much love...
´´...that tears came running down
your Mommy´s face.
´´Your writing is so natural...
´´...it makes me imagine
that you´re standing before me. ´´
´´Your letters come to us like sunshine.
´´lt´s our future that gives us big worries.
´´We yearn to get away from here.
´´That´s our fondest wish.
´´lt´ll be a difficult task for you
to bring us over there...
´´...but l have the feeling
you´ll manage it in time. ´´
When l arrived in England...
...l made it my priority...
...to try and find homes for people...
...because l felt people didn´t know...
...how desperate it was in Germany.
My biggest probIem
was to try and get my parents out.
That was difficult,
because it was either finding them a job...
...and bearing in mind my father´s age...
...or getting this €100 guarantee...
...which was just nowhere to be seen.
l proceeded...
...to find large houses...
...and knock at the door to find out...
...whether l could get them a job.
My mother as a cook or bottle washer.
My father as a gardener.
Anything just to get them out.
Sometimes l knocked at the door
and l burst into tears.
Sometimes l knocked at the door,
and with my very poor English...
...tried to explain what it was all about...
...who I was, what I wanted,
what I needed: heIp.
I did find someone...
...and it was just...
...Iike an unbeIievabIe dream come true.
My father had a first cousin...
...in London.
Every weekend l took the train
into London...
...and bombarded him.
l said, ´´Uncle Paul...
"´...you´ve got to get my parents
out of Germany."´
He said, "´I can´t do it."´
After me being so...
...insistent he finally said:
"´I´II give him an affidavit
if he has a working permit."´
l went back to the Rothschild estate...
...knocked on the door...
...and the butIer,
who was about 10-foot-6...
...came out ...
...and said to me:
"´What do you want?"´
I said,
"´I want to speak to Baron RothschiId."´
He said, "´Wait here."´
I waited.
A coupIe of minutes Iater he says:
"´FoIIow me."´
l said to him, ´´Baron Rothschild...
´´...my father´s cousin will give him...
´´...and my mother a visa...
´´...provided he has a working permit. ´´
Without hesitation...
...he said to me,
"´WouId he work on a chicken farm?"´
I said, "´He´II do anything."´
He went to a notary...
...and made out a working permit
for my parents.
The family that chose me
were the only people...
...l could rely on to give...
...a visa for my IittIe sister.
She was a beautifuI IittIe girI.
They had no chiIdren.
I showed them the photograph of Inge...
...and they seemed to like her very much.
But l realized one thing:
Uncle Billy...
...hated red hair.
UncIe BiIIy...
...was paying maintenance
for a red-haired chiId, not his...
...by his first wife.
WeII, say no more.
Inge was a bright redhead.
The question of hair color never arose
because l had brown hair.
One day he said to me quite idly:
´´What color hair does your sister have?´´
l said, ´´Oh, like mine. ´´
No more was said.
And they gave permission for her...
...to come and they wouId take her in.
l went very happily to England.
lt was an adventure, you know,
to go abroad, to go on the train.
My sister wrote fantastic letters.
Everything was wonderful.
She was having a marvelous time.
So was my brother.
My brother said he had a dog.
When I got there
actuaIIy there was a dog and a cat.
The dog bit me.
I didn´t think much of that.
lnge arrived, her hair aflame...
...titian-red....
Uncle Billy was furious.
He turned around
and he caIIed me a so-and-so Iiar.
I said to him:
"´Because Inge has red hair...
"´...I Ieave her at home in Germany?
"´Now you send her away. Don´t mind.
"´Thank you for asking her here."´
He caImed down in the end
and he did accept her into the house.
l think, l had a sense...
...while l was playing,
while l was laughing...
...that was the moment when I couId and
shouId´ve been doing something about...
...this demand on me...
...that I shouId bring my parents out.
From Dovercourt camp
l wrote a couple of letters...
...to the Refugee Committee in London.
l think they must have been moved
by a letter...
...from a child asking
to get her parents out of Vienna.
They did get my parents
a domestic service visa.
My parents appeared miraculously...
...in Liverpool on my 1 1th birthday.
I remember feeIing...
...that some terrific...
...weight that I had been carrying...
...and hadn´t known I had been carrying...
...was taken off my back.
Everything was being done
to get the papers...
...for my parents to come out...
...and war started.
And that was the end of that.
l just felt the world had come to an end.
Shattering, if l think about it.
Everything was buiIt...
...around this reunion...
...and my temporary stay in EngIand.
The fateful hour of 1 1:00 has struck...
...and the state of war once more exists
between Great Britain and Germany.
Only 25 minutes after war was declared
came the first air-raid warning.
Everything...
...we´d ever talked about or written about...
...or thought about, had all collapsed.
Everything had collapsed.
I think I cried for...
...not weeks, not months, I cried for years.
War ended all Kindertransports
and legal immigration...
...from Central Europe to England.
lt also ended regular mail
between the children and their parents.
The only way
they could now communicate...
...was by 25-word postcards
sent through the lnternational Red Cross.
The isolation came
when the letters ceased.
It was accepted
that you didn´t taIk about...
...what hurt you.
I couIdn´t speak Czech with anybody.
I didn´t want to teII my sister
how unhappy I was...
...because I feIt she was too young.
l wrote at that time in my diary:
´´l never dreamt
that one could be so lonely...
´´...and go on living...
´´...with this constant fear
for our loved ones.
´´The tears l shed at night
do not ease my pain...
´´...yet l was told that one feels better
after a good cry.
´´All l have is a swollen face...
´´...and my heart
is as heavy as it was before. ´´
My piIIow often was very wet
in the morning.
There was a gardener...
...who didn´t understand perhaps
what l was going through.
But he always said to me,
´´Don´t worry, it won´t last long. ´´
And whether I beIieved him or not
it was good to hear him say that.
And he aIways gave me a fIower.
Within a few months
of their arrival in England...
...many of the refugees,
along with other English children...
...were forced to evacuate
to new families in the country...
...to escape the expected bombing
of the cities.
-You consented to take two chiIdren?
-Yes, I´II take in two chiIdren.
Two IittIe girIs.
They´II be happy with you, I´m sure.
-Thank you very much.
-Two nice IittIe girIs, aren´t they?
None of the foster parents
with whom l stayed...
...and there were five of them...
...none of them could stand me
for very long.
All of them had the grace
to take in a Jewish child.
They were not particuIarIy warm.
They did not Iove me.
I did not Iove them.
NevertheIess, they did,
as I say, what most of us don´t do...
...which is to burden the househoId...
...the kitchens, the bedroom
and the Iiving room with this foreigner.
Mariam was somewhat aloof.
lt was her manner. She was loving, but...
...she didn´t hug and kiss me.
My mother was the exact opposite.
She used to not just kiss me once...
...she sort of kissed me Iike "´rat-tat-tat,"´
Iike a machine gun.
But Mariam was distant and nice...
...and I think that´s what I needed...
...because I had troubIe...
...reaIIy...
...feeIing that I beIonged there.
To have sort of pushed me into it
wouId have been difficuIt.
He didn´t cry, not at aII.
I couIdn´t understand it.
This is London calling.
Just once...
...they used to like to listen
to some programs on the wireless.
He used to come sit on my knee.
And there was something...
...in the news, I just heard him once go....
A IittIe sob and that was aII.
l tried really to please the Cohens
because l loved them...
...and l felt very dependent.
One of my main worries
was that l would be...
...sent away.
I know this happened to another boy,
somewhat oIder...
...who was taken in
by some friends of the Cohens.
He was arrogant and impossibIe...
...and eventuaIIy they simpIy
had to send him to some other home.
I´d heard of other pIaces
where this had happened.
So I feIt very much...
...on edge.
Word came that my mother
was no longer in London.
She went back to Vienna...
...to get my father to move,
who was impassive.
So I reaIIy did make up my mind
that I wouId be as tough as naiIs.
Nothing wouId hurt me.
I wouId have no emotions.
And it carried me through
for about six or seven years.
l got a scholarship to a grammar school.
People were saying to me,
partly in jealousy:
´´You know, they are snobs
in these schools and they´re anti-Semites.
´´You gotta watch yourself.
They´re gonna take it out on you. ´´
And l went to school.
I had a schooI tie, I guess...
...or a bIazer.
I was just entering a new worId.
The sun was shining.
I went to schooI, and a feIIow came up
to me and said, "´Who are you?"´
And I just knocked him down.
There was no doubt a cost...
...trying to be good aII the time
and keeping my anger in.
Only once did it slip.
One day John and l
were having breakfast...
...and there was some silly argument
over who got the marmalade first.
And Kurt threw a knife.
That was the onIy time he was naughty.
John had a IittIe wound here,
which was near his eye. It wasn´t nice.
Dr. Rose, who was our friend,
and Iived a few doors down...
...he came in and he was furious.
"´You shouIdn´t have taken this chiId in."´
lt terrified the entire family and me, too.
Since then l´ve been somewhat afraid
of my possibility of letting go to anger.
The other signs
that l had a lot inside me was that...
...l always had some intestinal problems...
...untiI I went into the army, and then I had
the most terribIe food and feIt fine.
I have an anaIogy for this:
When aII of us
have had the experience of finding...
...a bird with a broken wing...
...and you pick up this bird
and you hoId it in your hand...
...and you think it´s going to sit there,
quietIy, sweetIy...
...with its warm feathers, and be darIing.
It´s not. It immediateIy tries...
...to use its muscIes and it´s a very
uncomfortabIe thing to hoId in your hand...
...because there´s this fIuttering.
What he wants is to get away.
It may need you to hoId it and nurse it...
...but what he wants
is to get the heck out of there.
I think that´s what we were Iike.
CertainIy, that´s what I was Iike.
I was not nice to have around.
l got a new job in London...
...and l was working there
until June 28, 1940.
lt was lunchtime
and l was having a sandwich...
...when suddenIy two guys appeared.
Two men.
"´CID."´
"´What have I done?"´
"´Nothing. You are Abrascha GorbuIski?
"´You are now under arrest."´
"´Under arrest?
"´For what?"´
"´You are an enemy aIien,
pIease come with us."´
After Germany invaded Western Europe...
...the British began rounding up
all refugees from Germany and Austria...
...who were over the age of 16.
Although the vast majority
were refugees from Nazi persecution...
...anyone with a foreign accent
was viewed as a potential saboteur.
Within a few months...
...the government interned approximately
Plans were made
to deport as many as possible.
The good thing about Iife is
you remember aII the good things...
...that happened to you.
Bad things, you forget about them.
ln fact, you have to make an effort
to really remember them.
The day came
when we had to go to the ship.
Soldiers were standing there
with bayonets...
...mounted on their rifles.
And they pushed us aIong and said:
"´Leave your Iuggage, you´II get it Iater on."´
They pushed us aIong the deck.
Before Iong, we went down the stairs,
then more stairs. I was on the third deck.
Over 2,500 prisoners...
...twice the capacity of the ship...
...were crammed onto the HMT Dunera...
...supposedly bound for Canada.
Two days out of Liverpool...
...the Dunera was spotted
by a German U-boat.
Suddenly, something hits the ship.
The lights went out.
This is the end of it.
Everybody gravitated towards...
...the stairway,
which Ied to the deck above.
After about two minutes...
...you couIdn´t get up there
because there were many...
...peopIe going up the stairs,
we were just choking.
SuddenIy, the Iights went on again.
Everybody stopped in their...
...steps and went back down.
The torpedo didn´t explode...
...but l was under the impression
that the torpedo hit us sideways.
lt just bounced off.
Our luck, because if it had hit us...
...all of us would have been finished.
We were traveling,
going west for several days...
...but suddenIy our outIook said:
"´Something´s happening and we are not
going west. We´re going south."´
We had no idea where we were going,
except it must have been Australia.
We were starving daily.
They were treating us like pigs.
Being hungry every day,
peopIe were Iining up in the kitchen...
...to get an empty pot where the jam was,
just to scrape it out.
And having one sIice of bread.
The existence from one day to another
was worse than the day before.
And we were on the ship
for almost completely two months!
What happened on the Dunera?
Years Iater, I´m thinking:
"´This didn´t happen to me.
It must have been somebody eIse...
"´...because it was too horribIe to describe."´
From an overseas liner in Sydney harbor...
...a strange contingent of new arrivals
is transshipped aboard a ferry.
Enemy aliens who are being interned
in Australia for the duration of the war.
Before we knew it, we were off the ship.
The first thing l remember
is that each one of us...
...got a box...
...of food. That was the best meaI
I ever had in my Iife.
After starving for two months...
...I opened up the box.
There were two cheese sandwiches...
...thick Iike this, and a banana...
...and an appIe, and an orange...
...and they were giving second heIpings.
It was unbeIievabIe.
As the war progressed...
...reports of mass arrests and deportation
of Central-European Jews...
...began to reach Britain.
ln the spring of ´43, the city of Berlin...
...was cleansed of the last Jews.
They came and took...
...my famiIy and myseIf aIong.
We were taken to a coIIection point.
After a coupIe of days, we were deported...
...to Auschwitz, though we did not know...
...when we got to the train,
which consisted...
...of cattIe cars, where we were going.
We landed in Auschwitz
and the moment we landed there...
...we were commanded to leave
the trains...
...women with chiIdren to the Ieft
and men to the right.
That was the Iast time that I saw my wife,
my then wife, and chiId.
Lory Cahn and her family
were deported to Theresienstadt...
...the Czech ghetto the Nazis used
to deceive the world...
...about how humanely
they treated their prisoners.
ln time...
...the population of Theresienstadt
exceeded its capacity.
One day...
...they came into our barrack,
and my name was called...
...to report to the railroad station.
l went to the railroad station.
As they called your name,
you had to go and see this SS guy...
...and he crossed you off the list
and then you went into the car.
l got there and l repeated my name.
He said, "´You´re not going."´
I had no idea.
I didn´t dare ask why or what...
...but that was the end of it
and they sent me back.
And this went on for maybe two weeks.
l´d been at the railroad station,
l think, four times.
And l was a complete wreck.
To say good-bye to your parents...
...one time...
...a second time, a third time...
...and a fourth time...
...and once before,
when I was in the Kindertransport...
...it was...
...just absoIuteIy devastating.
Every time l said good-bye...
...l think l tore a little piece
out of my mother...
...and out of my father,
and also a big piece out of myself.
The last time it happened...
...l said to the guy:
"´WouId you terribIy mind,
but I want to go."´
"´Are you sure of that?"´ I said, "´Yes."´
He crossed my name off, and I went.
Little did l know
that we were going to Auschwitz.
It was a Iong period where I did not hear
anything from my parents.
I said, "´WeII, it´s wartime...."´
I found aII kinds of reasons and excuses.
Then, finally,
l received a letter from my father...
...in which he said, ´´Tomorrow...
´´...l´m going to be deported
to an unknown destination.
´´And it may be a very long time
before you hear from me again. ´´
Then l received a letter from my mother.
She said, ´´Tomorrow...
´´...l´m going to be deported from here. ´´
She encourages me to be good,
and honest...
...and courageous,
and to hold my head high...
...and to never give up hope.
And this at a time when I think she knew...
...what might be happening to her.
Then there was
one more communication from her.
A postcard dated September 4, 1942.
lt´s written in real shaky handwriting.
She´s saying that she´s traveling...
...to the East, and is saying
a very final good-bye to me.
But for many, many years...
...l would see the postcard in front of me...
...and l would see she´s saying:
´´Traveling to the East. ´´
Yet l would understand that she´s saying...
...she´s traveling in an easterly direction.
Then l would say to myself:
"´Maybe she´s going back to Kippenheim.
"´And maybe that´s good."´
And the finaI good-bye, I didn´t understand.
l always felt l should be grateful...
...that we´d been saved,
and that these peopIe had taken us in...
...and that l should be happier there.
But facts are facts,
and it wasn´t a good place to be.
UncIe BiIIy...
...who was not a very courageous man...
...every night, he wouId...
...go into the country,
and he took us with him.
We went to escape the bombs...
...untiI one day,
the peopIe where we were staying...
...we aII sIept in a room there
in a cottage...
...and the peopIe said
they didn´t want the German chiIdren.
So we didn´t go to the country anymore.
One day the sirens sounded...
...and what was known
as the ´´Coventry Blitz´´ started.
And when the bombs started to fall...
...we stayed at Auntie Vera´s mother´s...
...who had a boarding house.
All night long...
...the bombs rained down...
...and Coventry was a very hot place to be.
We were in one house
and that was bombed.
There was a big fire upstairs
and everybody rushed out.
ln the morning...
...when Auntie Vera
and Uncle Billy came back...
...and they saw one of the boarding houses
without any house...
...just a spiral of a bedstead...
...they were very shocked,
and they thought we´d been killed.
They rushed over to the other house...
...and there we were aII drinking tea,
as aIive as anything...
...and that was the onIy time
I saw Auntie Vera cry.
I think reIief, because...
...I guess she had a heart after aII.
Advance. End of Iine.
March!
-Jorgensky!
-Here!
-Tzufevich!
-Here!
-LeventhaI!
-Here!
-AIba!
-Here!
-RosenthaI!
-Here!
-Tozic!
-Here!
-ToIina!
-Here!
Yes, they aII have names Iike those.
This company, which I command...
...is aImost entireIy composed
of German and Austrian anti-fascists.
It is one of the fifteen aIien companies
in the Pioneer Corps.
The Dunera scandal
and the harsh treatment of refugees...
...began to shift public opinion
in England against internment.
The government
started releasing internees...
...and allowed them to join
the British armed forces.
Those who wanted to go back to England...
...they would send back
under one condition:
They would join the army.
l was anxious to get into this.
First of aII, I hated the Germans.
I hated their guts...
...and I wanted to be part of it.
Besides,
what was I going to do in AustraIia?
Sit in AustraIia throughout the whoIe war?
God forbid!
Girls, this is urgent.
lf you´re over 1 7-and-a-half and under 19...
...you can volunteer for the ATS.
The sooner you come,
the wider the choice of jobs avaiIabIe.
Come on, girIs, it´s urgent!
When l was 18...
...l had...
...to do either work of importance
or join the forces.
l decided to join the forces.
l also felt l was saying thank you
to England...
...for saving my life.
I think, as a soIdier, I feIt...
...suddenIy I was
in an environment where...
...I was the same as everyone eIse.
For the first time in my life, l think.
Because l think in Lincoln, l more or less...
...think, l existed.
Because I was waiting for tomorrow,
and tomorrow, and tomorrow.
l had lots of friends and...
...l did things l hadn´t done before.
l felt like everybody else.
The people on my left, the people
on my right, we were all the same...
...and that, I think,
was the first time in my Iife...
...I feIt that I couId do everything...
...the other peopIe were doing.
l wanted to do something
to help finish the war.
l said, ´´l want to go into nursing. ´´
The first year, l nearly gave up.
l found it very difficult...
...but I was determined to do it.
The second year was better.
Then it grew on me.
We were so busy, I didn´t have time
to think of myseIf, anyhow.
After about two years
of not hearing from our parents...
...life sort of stretched on endlessly,
but suddenly we heard...
...that our parents...
...had reached Spain.
Every night since I Ieft my parents,
I had prayed:
"´PIease, God,
don´t Iet it take Ionger than five years."´
Five years almost to the day...
...we got the telegram.
The telegram said:
´´Arriving Friday, 4:45. ´´
That was all.
UnfortunateIy, 4:45 was the train...
...that my schooI friends
were coming back on, as weII.
I knew that since the whoIe viIIage...
...aIso knew they were coming,
they wouId aII be at the station...
...and my schooI friends wouId see me...
...and my brother and sister,
meeting our parents...
...for the first time in five years.
It was a tremendous ordeaI.
We went down to the station to wait.
And I couIdn´t cope with it.
So I went back...
...home and I said:
"´I´m going home.
I´m going to put the kettIe on.
"´They´II need a cup of tea."´
How EngIish can you get?
l waited and waited and waited.
They took ages.
SuddenIy, there´s my brother and sister...
...with this middIe-aged, eIderIy coupIe...
...with suitcases and bags,
coming up the path.
I remember rushing down to meet them.
l knew they were my parents...
...but they weren´t
the same parents l´d left.
They were much older
and they were worn out.
And we obviously weren´t
the same children...
...that they´d sent off.
Suddenly l realized l couldn´t say anything
except their names.
´´Mommy and Daddy´´ or ´´Mutti and Papa. ´´
Then we just stood there...
...Iooking at each other.
It was such...
...a traumatic moment.
It was sad for Inge because
she couIdn´t speak German anymore.
My brother spoke it with difficuIty.
I was the onIy one
who couId communicate with them.
But the barriers compIeteIy went...
...and we became a family again.
The cease-fire began yesterday,
to be sounded...
...along all the fronts.
The German war is therefore at an end.
l remember VE Day very clearly.
lt was just wonderful.
We all danced in Piccadilly Circus...
...and for me, l just thought, well, this is it:
l´m going to see my parents next week.
I went straight back...
...and wrote to both of them.
I wrote separate Ietters
because I had separate addresses...
...through the Red Cross messages
in Theresienstadt.
The letters were returned to me...
...about three or four months later.
Took a long time.
All it said on the back was:
´´Deported to Auschwitz...
´´...October, ´44. ´´
And war was finished in May ´45.
That´s how I found out.
As soon as war finished...
...Hella and l went
to the Red Cross Committee...
...and asked them to search.
Eventually we got a letter from them...
...saying that my mother
had been killed in Minsk...
...in Russia, where she was deported.
It´s very hard to come to terms with...
...when you´ve aIways had that hope.
And, of course, we´ve had...
...no grave, reaIIy...
...no parting, no end, no funeraI.
It´s that sort of vague feeIing...
...in the air of hope,
and that hope suddenIy fading.
...in the children´s ward and l was
always joking with them and laughing.
And l was called to the telephone...
...and there was a telegram for me.
I asked her if she wouId read it.
So she read over the teIephone:
´´Your parents were gravely ill.
There was no hope.
´´Wait for further news. ´´
I probabIy didn´t quite take it in...
...so I went back to the ward and started...
...carried on making beds,
untiI one of the IittIe boys said to me:
"´Why aren´t you Iaughing this time?"´
That´s when I burst into tears and ran out.
l remember going out into the garden
and just lying on the lawn.
l didn´t want to be with anybody.
lt was such a shock.
And suddenIy the future,
which we aIways painted...
...wasn´t there. There was no future.
There was just an emptiness.
At the time l was liberated, a month later...
...l would have been 20...
...and l weighed 58 pounds...
...and that´s after
eight concentration camps.
Many times l thought about it:
What would have happened if my father...
...wouldn´t have pulled me out?
I wouId have never mentioned
it to my father.
You know, "´Why did you do that?"´
I think I wouId have done him very wrong.
And I can fuIIy understand,
being a mother...
...what it wouId mean if this is...
...what I wouId have had to go through
with my chiId, God forbid.
My main concern was always:
Let me be strong and let me try...
...to make it. l made it that far.
l want to make it to the end.
Regardless of what the end was.
Survival is an accident.
You cannot ask a soldier
who comes out of battle:
´´Why were your comrades,
left and right, killed...
´´...and you survived?´´ You have
no explanation for that. lt´s an accident.
At the moment of liberation...
...we were very happy,
but on the other hand...
...really very sad, because l realized...
...that I was one of the Iast
who had survived.
AII the others who had gone with me
to Auschwitz or had been taken...
...to Auschwitz wouId never return.
ln July, 1945...
...l went back to Germany
to work for the American government.
One of the reasons
was to look for my parents.
The most sensible place to go to,
would be to go back to Kippenheim.
But l didn´t go back...
...until August, 1947.
l think on some level...
...I knew my parents didn´t survive...
...but as Iong as I didn´t go back
to Kippenheim...
...I couId stiII say that maybe
they were back in Kippenheim...
...which doesn´t reaIIy make
a Iot of sense, but...
...I think it was just
my survivaI mechanism.
l just wasn´t ready yet to accept...
...the fact that l no longer had parents...
...that l hadn´t had parents for a long time.
Although the vast majority
of Kindertransport children...
...lost their mothers and fathers
in the Holocaust...
...remarkably...
...a few parents survived
to be reunited with their children.
My parents managed
to get out of Austria...
...by going to ltaly.
And from ltaly they got into France.
They were hidden by some extremely
wonderful people there.
After the war ended...
...I was toId that my parents...
...were aIive...
...and that some day I wouId probabIy
have to go back and Iive with them.
I think I was horrified by that idea.
Uncle Percy persuaded my parents...
...to wait until l´d finished...
...the English School Certificate at age 16.
And also, they needed time
to re-establish themselves.
Eventually, in 1947,
they were ready for me.
l didn´t want to go,
but the Cohens took me to Paris...
...where l was to meet my parents.
I remember standing outside the hoteI.
I saw, in the distance,
my parents approach.
I couIdn´t Iook at them directIy.
So I Iooked at them...
...their refIection in a shop window...
...as they waIked towards me. I feIt...
...a very, very strong emotion.
lt was a sense...
...of elation...
...and of love. l suddenly felt it...
...and fought it.
But l felt, you know, l knew it was them.
We met.
Kurt´s father, who was more demonstrative
than the mother...
...put his hand through Kurt´s curIs...
...and Kurt went Iike that,
and gave him a waIIop.
And my husband says,
"´Don´t you ever do that again, Kurt.
"´Your father is showing you his affection."´
And that was that.
When it came to say good-bye
to the Cohens...
...I reaIized for the first time,
I think, consciousIy...
...that...
...they had Ioved me, especiaIIy Percy...
...because he was in tears,
and I´d never seen him cry...
...I´d never seen him cry before.
Then we had to Ieave him.
I remember him Iooking back.
It was very, very sad.
He didn´t want to go.
He didn´t know them.
My parents let go of a 7-year-old...
...and got back a 16-year-old.
And my mother especially wanted...
...to carry on where she´d left off.
And a 16-year-old doesn´t like
to be treated like a 7-year-old.
So, when we got back to France,
things were very difficult.
Of course, I´m very Iucky. I reaIize this.
Most of the Kinder
never saw their parents again.
I not onIy had mine back,
but another set of parents as weII.
What more couId one ask for?
l ceased to be a child
when l boarded the train...
...in Prague.
lt´s strange that it´s only six years
out of a long life...
...and those six years
wiII affect the rest of your Iife.
l never belonged when l was a child.
l wanted somewhere to find roots.
l feel...
...in the latter years of my life
that l´ve been accepted.
And nobody´s ever said to me:
"´You weren´t born in this country."´
I was as entireIy accepted
as everyone eIse.
And l gradually felt...
...l had somewhere l belonged.
To be a refugee...
...is the most horrible feeling, because...
...you lose your family,
you lose your home...
...you´re also without an identity.
Suddenly, you´re a nothing.
You are just reliant on other people´s...
...good nature, and help,
and understanding.
That´s why, l think...
...Iiving in IsraeI,
I feeI for the new immigrants.
I feeI for the Russians, and the Ethiopians...
...and anybody who´s new,
especiaIIy if they come without famiIies.
If I can do anything, I do it.
l am dazzled,
from the point of view of a writer.
Who else has...
...the unbelievably good fortune to live...
...with the Jewish manufacturer...
...the English working-class union man...
...railroad stoker, the milkman...
...and the Anglo-lndian Victorian ladies?
Whoever has the sheer...
...advantage of not studying this
from the outside...
...but being a heIpIess member
from the inside of these famiIies?
Seems to me...
...it was a gift.
Didn´t seem so at the time.
l now look at...
...my 14-year-old grandson...
...and l think, ´´This is the age when l lost...
´´...parents, home, country. ´´
A lot has been made up to me...
...from where l lost out.
l have a second cousin here.
He says "´Anything you haven´t had,
you´ve got now."´
Which is so true.
And I´m very gratefuI
and very proud of the whoIe famiIy.
The younger you were, the more
unforgiving you are of your parents.
You may say they were so brave
and saved you...
...but they really abandoned you.
We were four friends, very close friends.
We all agreed:
"´If it ever happens again...
"´...we wiII not send away our chiIdren.
We wiII stay...
"´...and die together."´
That´s what we said.
Later on, as we grew oIder, we said...
...we mitigated it, we said:
"´If it ever happens, we promise to take
each other´s chiIdren in.
"´We wiII not send them to strangers."´
l certainly do my share of remembering...
...but remembering also has to have...
...a present and future perspective.
You can´t just stop at remembering.
l don´t think l ever made
a conscious decision to devote myself...
...to human rights and social justice issues.
Someone helped me.
l can´t pay back...
...or thank some of the people
who helped me...
...but l can do something for other people.
l´ve come to a conclusion about myself:
ln 1938 l escaped...
...the deportation of Poland.
l got out of Germany
in the Kindertransport.
l was sent to Australia on a ship.
The ship was torpedoed
and nothing happened.
l got back to England and was in the army.
Why all these coincidences?
I´ve come to one concIusion:
I was meant to survive.
Not because of myseIf...
...but because the Jews were to survive.
And I wouId bring up another generation.
And they wouId Iive.
I Iook at my chiIdren...
...and my grandchiIdren, and I know...
...there was a purpose to my Iife.
