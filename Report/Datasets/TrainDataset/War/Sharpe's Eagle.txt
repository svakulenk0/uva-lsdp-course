I'm giving you a field commission, Sharpe.
From this moment on
you're a Lieutenant in the 95th
We need somebody
to command Dunnett's sharpshooters,
and Sharpe will be happier up in the mountains
than up in the mess.
All I know is how to fight.
So, if there's any man amongst you
expecting a quick ramble through this war
now's the time
Bravo
I want you to have my sword.
Maybe if the men see you carry it...
They'll think I'm a proper officer.
- Morning, Lieutenant.
- Morning, miss. I hope you slept well.
I slept safely.
Thank you.
Now, there's a woman worth fighting dirty for, sir.
VIVAR: The gonfaon The banner of blood
Do you really believe
men will fight and die for a rag and a pole?
You do, Richard.
You do.
VIVAR: Sant'lago!
WELLESLEY: You did damn well Sharpe
Napoleon will be in a fearful rage
about Torrecastro, which is all to the good,
because next month I mean to cross into Spain,
and give Marshal Victor a damn good thrashing.
Stick with me, Richard. I'll see you right.
You'll see me dead, sir.
Oh, that's my boy!
HARPER: There were three lovely lassies
from Lisbon, Lisbon
Oh, Lisbon
There were three lovely lassies from Lisbon
- What? Harper?
- But Maggie was the belle...
Easy. Maggie the maggot's done the trick.
Your wound's as clean as a whistle.
You'll be running around in a week.
Sit up, now, and I'll give you a nice shave, sir.
Eyes right!
What the devil's going on, Harper?
Ah, Nosey's being nice to the Spanish, sir.
If you ask me, he's planning a battle.
SHARPE: Damn this leg
should be down there
catching Wellesley's eye
I'll never get my promotion confirmed
lying in bed.
Now, now, sir. Hold steady.
Military march
- Must be a damned good book, Hogan.
- Shakespeare, sir.
Julius Caesar.
Mark Antony. "Lend me your ears," eh?
"These many, them shall die.
Their names are pricked."
By God, you may be sure my name is
well pricked by those needles at Horse Guards.
Ah. A general who wins battles
and lives to claim the credit
will never lack for enemies in London, sir.
And yet...
And yet they still behave
with their usual folly and weakness.
I have officers deserving commissions,
notably William Lawford
And what am I sent?
Flogged soldiers led by coffee-house
fops, commanded by dangerous buffoons.
Sir Henry Simmerson and the South Essex.
Quite so. I suspect he's been sent to spy on me.
Well, why not give him something to send back,
that will spoil their Lordships' supper?
Such as what, Hogan?
A victory, sir.
Small, but solid.
Small, but solid?
The bridge at Valdelacasa?
Mmm... something like that.
I could spare the South Essex,
but Sir Henry Simmerson isn't up to it.
No.
But Richard Sharpe is.
Richard Sharpe?
Let Sharpe do all the dirty work...
and Simmerson and that obnoxious nephew
of his get all the glory.
And if all does not go well?
Simmerson will have to keep quiet about it,
and you will have him in your power.
And if things go really badly?
We may lose a gallant officer.
Not Sharpe?
Oh, no, no.
BOTH: Simmerson.
Military march
South Essex... halt!
The South Essex, Hogan.
All mine.
Sir Henry!
Oh, sorry you've missed the parade, sir.
Damn it! Missed it, have we?
A dozen of the bastards
pretended to faint from the heat.
By God, I'll flog the fainting out of them!
- Drill them Mr. Denny
- Yes, sir.
Carry on, Drum Major!
Forward march!
Well, Hogan, what do you think of them?
A fine body of men, sir.
Sir Arthur warned me in advance
"Hogan" says he
"the South Essex is a sight to make you shiver."
His words.
Hm. I dare say he knows I have a cousin
who holds high office at Horse Guards.
Have you, by Jove?
Well, I hope you'll convey my respects to him,
at the conclusion of our mission, sir.
You mind me, Hogan, I'll mind you.
Make them jump to it, Mr. Denny!
I wonder how he keeps them looking so shiny.
He flogs them.
HARPER: I'm afraid you can't afford her sir
That bastard has bought her.
Same as he's bought his commission
Major, may I introduce the jewel in our crown?
Josefina, Countess La Costa.
Your servant, ma'am.
The late Count fell at Vimieiro.
You bear the loss with great fortitude, ma'am.
The Countess is traveling under the protection
of my nephew, Lieutenant Christian Gibbons.
This is his friend Lieutenant Berry
I must say,
that uniform does you credit, Mr. Gibbons.
Good God! Look at Dobbs dragging his feet.
Mr. Berry "At the double."
At the double, Mr. Denny!
DENNY: At the double!
Have pity, Sir Henry. They've been
marched sore in the hot sun all day.
No lectures from you, Major Lennox.
Mr. Berry,
when he can appreciate it
Lay them on Mr. Berry
I must protest...
By God, Lennox! I knew you were an old man
when I took you on, but not an old woman.
Speaking as a Virginian, sir,
I must say as how I don't hold
with flogging white men, sir.
My dear Captain Leroy, you may be a Loyalist,
but you are still an American.
You do not know the British soldier, sir.
He is a brute beast in a red coat.
He needs the lash!
Whip him in, Mr. Berry.
SIR HENRY: Must you go Hogan?
Fancy a brandy and a choice cigar?
Er... no, I hate to pass
on a brandy and a choice cigar,
Sir Henry, but... duty calls.
Servant, ma'am.
Gentlemen
No, come on, Jeremiah.
Let's go and have a wash.
Silly old sod!
You must indulge him, dear boy.
They say he has influence.
He may even have the ear of the King.
If Major Hogan makes his way up here,
we've got to show him
you're ready for action.
But I'm not ready for action.
I know that and you know that,
but we can't let that murderous old bugger know.
Pat. Richard.
- Good to see you, Major Hogan.
- Good to see you, Richard. How's the knee?
March up and down, boy.
Splendid. Splendid. Good man, Richard.
Up and about, what?
Yes, sir.
Pat's maggots did the trick, eh?
Where would the English be
if it wasn't for the Irish?
Me and Pat and Wellesley -
three Irish heroes
standing between Britannia and Bonaparte.
- Thank you, sir.
- Time you played your part, Richard.
Wellesley's worried about you.
"That fellow Sharpe, Hogan who saved my life
is that fellow still alive Hogan?"
"Alive and kicking," says I, quick at the repartee.
"Damn his impertinence!
Don't he know there's a war on?"
"He wants promotion, sir," says I,
again quick at the repartee.
He looks at me down his long nose.
"Hogan," says he,
"Hogan, tell Sharpe he'll never make captain
nursing his health " His very words
Give Lieutenant Sharpe a drink, Pat.
Best brandy.
Took it from the French at Oporto
Sit down, man. Sit down. You seem edgy.
Good show, Sir Henry!
Pretty sight
Spit it out, Major. What do you want?
Now, who said I wanted anything?
Well, let's just say I want your opinion.
Sir Henry apart, the South Essex -
what do you make of them, man for man?
They're flogged soldiers, sir...
...and flogging teaches a soldier only one lesson.
And that is what, Richard?
How to turn his back.
Do you know anything about art, Richard?
Do you know Rubens?
Botticelli?
What the devil is it, sir?
It's a map of Spain.
Oh, sorry. It's upside down.
Makes no difference, either way!
Now, here...
we have the River Tagus.
And this is the town of Valdelacasa.
There's a bridge here, not marked.
Wellesley wants us to destroy it.
Can you wave
in the general direction of the French?
Right here, Richard.
At the bridge.
You want me?
No. And you can't order me, sir.
Bad leg wound. The doctor says so.
Oh, well, that's a pity, now,
cos you'll miss a chance to see Teresa.
Teresa?
How?
Well, didn't I tell you that Teresa's been
looking after the French for me at Valdelacasa?
On top of that,
destroy that bridge at Valdelacasa,
and, mark my words,
it'll be Captain Richard Sharpe.
A captain. I'll drink to that.
Now, look, sir. The 95th are leaving for England,
apart from a few that are left here.
If General Wellesley wants me
to go into country infested by French patrols,
grab a bridge,
and hold it long enough
for you to blow it to kingdom come,
well, then, sir,
I'll need a crack company of first-class men.
My dear boy, that's exactly what Sir Arthur said.
"Hogan" says he
"Sharpe will need a crack company"
"We don't have one," says I.
"Hogan, I don't care if you have to steal
the best regiment in the army,
but you find Sharpe his crack company."
His very words.
By God! I think he means it, Pat.
A company? Well, which one, sir?
The Coldstream Guards?
Never. Too much to hope for.
The Connaught Rangers.
The Connaught Rangers? Very steady.
Now, let's see. The 48th Foot, sir?
"March at night and fight at day."
By God, it's not the 48th, is it?
The South Essex, Sharpe.
SHARPE: Chosen Men! Back to barrack s!
Britches and boots on, you bloody idlers!
Where the blazes are they, Harper?
Whoring, sir. If I told them once,
I told them a thousand times not to go whoring.
"Boys," says I, "if you need
to hold on to something, hold a bottle."
Isn't that the best advice, sir?
You bloody old bishop!
What does it matter whether they're pissed
or poxed, so long as they can fight?
Is that you, Tongue?
Where are they?
O, woe unto them that rise up
early in the morning and follow strong drink...
- all day.
- Oh, God!
Not now!
Jezebel.
Clean them up.
I want them ready for the road tomorrow.
Sweat them, Sergeant.
Sweat them.
Harris, I'll have that.
God bless all here.
Right, lads. Fall in.
We've a bit of a bridge to blow up.
We... ain't going anywhere, sarge.
Anywhere?
Nee, sarge
We ain't going to get ourselves killed...
just so Sharpe can become a captain.
Besides, we've not been bloody well paid
for bloody well six weeks.
HARRIS: We're heading for Oporto
English ships loading wine - they'll take us.
I agree.
Well... I'll miss you.
So... that's it?
You don't want the son of a whore
to raise himself out of the dirt,
and stand the same height as Simmerson
and his no-good nephew?
Hm?
You want Sharpe to know his place,
the same way he knew your place
when you first joined the Rifles?
What were you?
Broken-down scribblers,
like Harris?
Poor little bastards like Perkins?
Bible-thumpers, like Tongue?
Poachers and picklocks
like Hagman and Cooper?
What were you?
Dust on a boot.
But look at you now.
Chosen Men.
Men who wear the white cord of courage.
Picked out and promoted
Why?
Because you didn't know your place.
Picked out cos you pushed to the front
and proved you were braver men
than those around you
Because you wanted to prove you were
better men than you were ever born to be
There's no sin in being born in the dirt boys
But it's a terrible sin to want to stay there.
Them's very dainty feet
you got there Cooper
Will they carry you as far as the bridge?
They'll carry me across the bridge.
And that's a promise, sarge.
You're living saints, all right.
God bless you, boys.
Men at the ready, Sergeant?
All the lads are fine, sir. Delighted, so they are.
Always glad to be having a crack at the French.
Nil desperandum. That's their motto, sir.
You're a lying sod, Harper.
One hour.
Yes, sir.
GIBBONS: Out of the way.
- You fellow what regiment?
- 95th.
I say, Berry old boy, this is one
of the ragamuffins we're taking with us tomorrow.
When an officer says "step aside",
you step aside.
Maybe this'll help you to remember.
Dangerous street for a lady, ma'am.
You should take a man with you.
Major Hogan, I have been struck
by a common soldier.
I believe the penalty
for striking an officer is death.
Death is the penalty for striking that officer.
That was Sharpe of the 95th.
What?
The ragamuffin that jumped from the ranks?
By God, I'll teach him to touch a gentleman.
I'll call him out, sir. I'll see him at dawn.
I'll second you, old boy.
A duel? Oh, give me your hand, sir.
You're a brave fellow, Gibbons.
Sharpe's a killer.
Killed three French and saved Wellesley's life.
Three seconds slash, cut, thrust.
And that's while he was still a sergeant.
Shall we say six o'clock tomorrow morning
in the field behind the camp?
Or shall we say it was damned dark,
and you made a damned bad mistake?
Silly mistake. Say no more about it, eh?
Good thinking, Gibbons.
Sharpe would have shot out your left eye
at a minute past six,
and you'd have spent tomorrow
looking at nothing with the other.
Come on.
Ma'am.
Berry, old boy...
Don't worry, old boy. Sharpe is a dead man.
SERGEANT 75: and a done sir
Parade, dismiss!
A pint of rum, Pat. Half-and-half.
Argh!
You're going to be all right, son.
Sharpe's special
A pint of best rum. Half-and-half.
Half in your belly...
...and half on your back.
Argh!
Sir Henry says it keeps the chin up.
There's better ways to keep a chin up.
Sharpe, isn't it?
Made a name for yourself in India.
Battle of Assaye, as I recollect.
I was there myself with the 78th.
I Saw the 78th advance...
on their own.
The man who made a name for himself that day
was an officer of the 78th.
A man by the name of Lennox.
Aye, a long time ago.
Ah, I had a life's soldiering, then they retired me.
My wife died.
The South Essex was all I could get.
But thank you for reminding me
I was once a damned good soldier.
Now, wipe your boots.
I'll take you to meet a damned bad one.
Well, bleed me, damn you, Parton!
This scarifier is the latest thing in London.
Do it
I always find a flogging brings on a spleen.
Do you find that too, Major Hogan?
Watching a flogging, Sir Henry, builds up
huge combustible gases in the internal organs.
Combustible gas, if confined,
will act like a charge
of blasting powder
Speaking as an engineer...
...I think it would be best to bleed you again.
Well, you heard him.
Do you think I want to burst? Bleed me.
SIR HENRY: and who the devil are you sir?
- Lieutenant Sharpe, sir.
No, you're not. You're a damned disgrace.
Get him a decent jacket.
No, sir.
This is the green jacket of my regiment, sir.
The 95th.
It is an honor to wear it
in any condition
What?! You are under my orders, sir.
With respect, Sir Henry, the situation is
that General Wellesley has placed Lieutenant
Sharpe and his men in my disposition.
But damn it, I am in command!
Well, it's because of that that General Wellesley
doesn't want to add to your responsibilities,
viz the South Essex, the march to Valdelacasa,
the relations with the Spanish allies
So much to do.
Also, there are certain exigencies of engineering
to which Lieutenant Sharpe is particularly suited.
Fetch and carry, eh?
Well, you may get to fight, too, Sharpe.
- Done any soldiering?
- A little, sir.
You look old for a lieutenant.
I came from the ranks, sir.
You mean you're not a gentleman?
No, sir.
By God, Sharpe! This will not do.
All my officers are gentlemen.
That being so, sir, I think we should
introduce ourselves like gentlemen.
Quite so, Captain Leroy. Quite so.
My name's Leroy.
Mighty pleased to meet you, Mr. Sharpe.
From America, sir?
No, sir. From Virginia.
Captain Leroy's
one of the brave American Loyalists
who refused to accept
the ravages of democracy,
and whose father fought for his King
against Washington
Washington won.
Fortunately, Captain Leroy
has ample means to console himself
- during his exile
- Slaves, cotton and molasses, sir.
All melted down into golden guineas.
I suppose I must introduce you
to Lieutenants Gibbons and Berry
I've met the young gentlemen, sir.
- I hope you know your place, Sharpe.
- You've made it very clear, sir.
Tell me. Who made you an officer?
Sir Arthur Wellesley, sir.
Wellesley? Ha
Wellesley don't know
what makes a good soldier. Not many do.
Do you know, Mr. Sharpe?
Yes, sir.
And what makes a good soldier, Sharpe?
The ability to fire three rounds a minute.
Three a minute?!
The South Essex can fire two on a good day.
You think you could do better, Mr. Sharpe?
Yes, sir.
You have until sunset, sir.
Any man who cannot fire three rounds a minute
will be flogged.
Carry on Sharpe
It's all Wellesley's doing. Upstarts everywhere.
But no need to tell you that, Captain Leroy.
I'm told that in America common merit
counts for more than birth or wealth
Whoever told you that, sir...
is a goddamn liar.
Democracy or monarchy -
it don't make no difference.
Money talks.
Merit walks.
Send them to Ireland. We'd be free in a week.
Two rounds the minute, sir.
What the devil are you doing here?
Mr. Berry's orders, sir.
The French are over there...
waiting.
They fire three rounds a minute.
You fire two.
By sunset tomorrow, you'll all be dead.
Take off your jackets and stocks.
SHARPE: Bites the cartridge
pours the powder
spits the bet
No ramrod.
Just a gentle tap of the butt to send it down.
Save 20 seconds.
The trick is... to keep the muzzle up
to stop the bloody bullet falling out.
Of course,
the muzzle needs to point up anyway.
The Frog coming towards you
is high up on a horse.
Right... let's get to work.
Double ranks, Mr. Denny.
Double ranks!
And, Mr. Denny,
if you see any man
doing anything not in the manual...
Take his name sir?
Give him half a pint of rum on the spot,
Mr. Denny.
Time this, Mr. Denny.
Tell them to load and fire in their own time.
Load and fire in your own time.
Load!
Bite, pour, spit, tap.
Aim.
Bite, pour, spit, tap, aim.
Steady, now, Dobbs. Bite.
Pour
Spit Tap
Do it again, Dobbs.
Cartridge. Bite.
Pour spit tap
Aim
Damn it, Josefina. I was worried about you.
Why?
Did you think
that Mr. Sharpe had stolen me away?
Three shots and ten seconds in hand, sir.
Seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.
Four shots the minute!
Sharpe.
Yes, sir?
Stop showing off, Sharpe.
Yes, sir.
Was set on Earth
for everyone quite equally to share
Some poacher bold, as I unfold
Keep up your gallant heart
Aye, and think about those poachers bold
That night in Rufford Park
Soldiering, sir! This is the life.
Fun, ain't it, Josefina?
Have you ever been in battle, Christian?
No. Hope to. Bloody good fun, eh?
I saw Vimieiro.
It made me cry.
Countess not co-operating, old boy?
I wish I knew what would please her.
Ask the maids.
What the blazes are you on about,
Berry, old boy?
Her name's Jacinta
had a bit of a fumble with her last night
- A bit out of the bottom drawer, eh?
- I'm not exactly top drawer myself, old boy.
The Countess owes her maids
two months' wages
I say, what say you lend me some tin
and I pay the maids?
I don't lend, old boy.
I'll play cards with you for three guineas.
Or you can touch your Uncle Henry.
Damn it, I touched him yesterday
to settle what I owed you.
Three guineas. Double or nothing tonight, eh?
SIR HENRY:
Captain Leroy tell Sharpe to get a move on
Madam.
Sorry about this, Sharpe.
Sir Henry's compliments,
and you're not to dawdle in the rear.
Right, lads. If we can't dawdle in the rear...
we may as well dawdle in the front.
Took the words out of my mouth, sir!
War is as natural to man, sir, as...
as... er...
- As nature, sir?
- Uh?
Yes. As natural as nature.
- What the blazes?
- Quick time, sir.
The Rifle Regiment has only two marches
quick time and dawdle.
What have they brought the woman for?
Because they don't know any better.
Harris, Cooper, Hagman.
Don't miss, damn you.
LENNOX: Sharpe! He's in trouble. Come on.
Come back at once, Major Lennox!
Sharpe brought it on himself, sir.
The South Essex will advance slowly
and with caution, Major Lennox.
Did you get them?
Yes!
South Essex, halt!
Fall in, lads.
No dawdling, now.
He's making fools of us.
Boys, who's for an apple?
SHARPE: Pay him
- How dare you, sir?
The Spanish are our allies, sir.
We do not loot comrades-in-arms.
Don't lecture me on allies, sir!
We're on our way
to meet a high-ranking Spanish colonel.
That's what I call an ally,
not some stinking peasant!
General Wellesley's orders
are to pay for all food and drink, sir.
Wellesley's a fool.
The French live off the land. Why not us?
You want to pay him, Mr. Sharpe?
Pay him from your own purse
I will pay.
This is between me and him, Countess.
- Cuánto vale, señor?
- Think you've got the tin, Sharpe?
Nada.
Is this nada too, eh? Eh, you rascal...
- Shoot the blackguard!
- Don't move, Sir Henry.
Sharpshooters sir
All aiming at you.
Who the devil's this?
Comandante Teresa
the leader of the guerrillas
The Spanish call her The Needle Don't ask why
Buenos dias, Comandante Teresa.
Let's go, Hogan. And get these fools out of here.
The man with the cart is Capitán Garcia,
the Commander of this region.
I am hoping he will join forces with me.
The guns were a token of goodwill.
Understand me?
Perfectly. A marriage of convenience.
Well, let's be on our way, Sir Henry.
South Essex!
Follow me
Rifles, halt!
South Essex, halt!
We'll camp here tonight, Sir Henry.
Destroy the bridge at dawn.
This evening we dine with the Spanish officers.
Teresa want you to keep Josefina company
And you'll need all your strength
for tomorrow.
That's an order.
He will make good his right
To be a pilgrim
HAGMAN:
I will fly back home to the one that I love
And in her soft bosom
I would build me a nest
And pillow my head upon her lily-white breast
Where rifles crack and cannons swath
on a foreign field still call her name
and if am delivered as I hope to be
I shall sail home to England
and never part from thee
SIR HENRY: Is Britannia afraid of Napoleon?
No sir Britannia is not
- Fancy a fumble, old boy?
- Hm?
Well, you might as well have the maid,
since you can't have the mistress.
SIR HENRY: Deem it a great honor
as Commanding Officer of the South Essex,
in the presence of our gallant allies,
to acknowledge the auspicious portents
of our Anglo-Spanish alliance.
ALL Hear, hear! Bravo!
And it gives me great pleasure
to propose this toast.
Gentlemen, to His Most Catholic Majesty,
King Ferdinand VII.
ALL King Ferdinand VII.
HOGAN: Hear, hear, Sir Henry.
Hear, hear. Bravo.
I'm going to get a bit of fresh air.
Good night, Major. Enjoy yourself.
I will.
I've laid ten guineas with Leroy
that Sir Henry will talk for a full hour.
Five minutes more and I'll have won my bet.
Bravo, Sir Henry! More, more, more.
Bad luck, old boy.
Good night, Christian.
Lieutenant Berry.
BERRY: Good night, Countess, dear.
Damn it!
Cards, old boy?
Afraid you've cleaned me out, Berry, old boy.
I've no luck at cards.
I've no luck in love.
Nothing left.
You have the Countess.
BARRY: And the Countess has troubles.
What the devil are you on about, old boy?
I'll give you three guineas on her.
You win, and you go and pay her maids.
I'm sure she'll show her gratitude.
Ah... ah... what happens if you win, old boy?
Uh? Uh?
Then I go and pay her maids.
I say, Berry! You don't mean... er?
Cards, old boy?
I was having a wee chat
with one of the maids, sir.
Jacinta. Nice girl.
But it seems Berry's been enjoying her favors.
It appears the Countess is a wee bit hard up, sir,
and, you know,
she wasn't born a countess at all,
but sort of worked her way up through the ranks.
So did I, Harper.
If Berry's tumbling the maid, sir...
he knows the Countess is in trouble.
Who goes there?
Beg pardon, ma'am.
Countess...
Don't laugh at me
I can get you a loan from Hogan
Does everybody know?
People are not sure
Show them the money, they will all keep quiet
Why are you concerned?
You have never had any money
I did... but the French stole it from me
What do you want in return?
I want to see their faces when you
give them the money
Gibbons and Berry...
These Don Juans take advantage only
of women who have no money
Why do you try to hide your feelings?
You're really very kind
Hasta la mañana, señor!
Hasta mañana, señor!
SIR HENRY: Silly old buffoon
Bad luck, old boy.
JOSEFINA: No se olvida el dinero, señora.
I say, Berry, old chap...
Not backing down on a debt of honor?
What's that for, old boy?
The Countess has been very naughty.
Making eyes at Sharpe, making little of you.
Making a fool of Sir Henry.
Calling herself a countess.
Very naughty indeed.
Naughty girls get spanked, and put to bed.
Eesa?
This...
or this?
SHARPE: How about this?
What's got you boys all riled up?
The honor of the South Essex, sir.
Berry unmasked this woman as an impostor
and asked her to leave.
This woman can't even pay her own servants
I want her out of the camp tonight!
Mr. Berry, see to it. Bag and baggage!
This woman is under my protection, sir.
What?! How dare you, sir?
I hold an officer's commission.
It is both my right and my duty...
to take a woman in distress into my care.
He's got that right.
Only if he can pay for her protection.
Mr. Berry is right, Captain Leroy.
Mr. Sharpe must pay the servants.
Hey, Mr. Sharpe.
You dropped your purse when you was tussling
with the young gentleman.
Iros de mi vista.
Captain Leroy...
Slaves, cotton and molasses... sir.
I owe you a debt, Mr. Sharpe.
And I Leroy.
Good night.
You are lucky to have him.
He is lucky to have me
You risked a lot, defending her.
She is very beautiful.
She's a woman.
She needed help.
I could have killed him.
I know what happens when soldiers run wild.
He will cause more trouble for her.
Not with you to protect her.
Promise me you will take care of her.
My job here is done.
I've brought Garcia
and Major Hogan together.
I'm leaving. Tomorrow.
Stay with me.
French infantry, sir.
Small patrol, sir. Just looking.
Ah, well, now.
We'll be giving them something to look at.
I say, Hogan!
Enemy in sight.
Then let's get some prizes, dear boys. Hm?
- Major Lennox
- Sir?
You will take men and the Colors
and chase away those damned French.
But we are about to destroy the bridge,
and these are very green troops.
Do you disobey my orders, sir?
I have never disobeyed an order in my life, sir.
Mr. Denny.
Call out the guard.
Sir.
Turn out the guard!
Right... face!
LENNOX: Halt.
Forward... march!
This is a fool's mission. Watch my flank, Sharpe.
DENNY: Halt!
Make Ready
Present. Fire!
Watch the flank! The flank!
- French cavalry!
- Chosen Men!
- Destroy the bridge! Destroy the bridge!
- Goddamn!
Hurry, damn you! Hurry!
Major Lennox
Argh!
I lost the Colors.
I want an eagle.
An imperial eagle
touched by the hand of Bonaparte himself.
Hey, Sharpe.
It's got a brass point.
You push it in deep so I can feel it
LEROY: An eagle?
Guess a dying man can dream.
At a place called Assaye...
...I saw a whole army ready to run.
Then a major of the 78th
took a step to his front,
and steadied the line
That's him
Major Lennox.
I thought he was just an old man.
Sir... what will Mr. Sharpe do,
now that Major Lennox
has asked him for an eagle?
I didn't hear Sharpe say nothing about no eagle,
Mr. Denny, and neither did you.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
If you want to live, Mr. Denny,
you stay away from Sharpe.
You've lost the Colors, sir.
The King's own Colors,
touched by his own hand
Take my advice and a pistol
and go behind that tent...
and blow out what's left of your brains.
Permission to speak, sir.
- What is it, Harper?
- Would you take an order from me, sir?
- Well, what is it?
- Would you for the love of Jesus stand easy?
It's easy for you to say "stand easy",
Harper.
Tell him. Just tell him the truth, sir.
Tell him that Simmerson cut and ran.
You expect Wellington to take my word
against the word of Simmerson?
JOSEFINA: I...
HARPER: Look...
I have come to offer you my support, Mr. Sharpe,
if that is worth anything to you.
Thank you.
Harper, would you escort the Countess inside?
Happy to, sir.
Sir.
What are you going to do?
I'll do what I always do.
I'll stand and fight.
Continue, Sir Henry.
Well, sir, on first sighting the French,
I naturally gave the order to advance.
That's my style, sir.
The South Essex crossed over the bridge
and engaged the enemy.
Major Lennox panicked so then I fell back
in good order and destroyed the bridge sir
I have written to Horse Guards, sir,
to state that the South Essex
acquitted itself most commendably,
in discharging both your general orders
to engage the enemy,
and your particular order to destroy the bridge.
Did any officer distinguish himself?
Lieutenant Gibbons led the advance, sir.
You may say that he is tied to me by blood.
But is it a tie of blood to tie my tongue
and rob a brave man of his just reward?
No sir
recommend
Lieutenant Gibbons be gazetted Captain sir
And Lieutenant Sharpe?
Lieutenant Sharpe dithered, sir.
He was cut off when we destroyed the bridge.
This is a report from Major Hogan,
which differs somewhat from your account,
Sir Henry.
Major Hogan is merely an engineer, sir.
Major Hogan's coat buttons up tight
over a number of other duties, Sir Henry.
Major Hogan reports a number of losses
Sir Henry
He says you first lost your head, and instead
of destroying the bridge, marched over it.
He says you then lost your nerve
and ran from a small French patrol.
He says you lost ten men,
a major and two sergeants
He says you finally lost your sense of honor
and destroyed the bridge,
cutting off a rescue party
led by Lieutenant Sharpe
Major Hogan leaves the worst to the last
He says you lost the King's Colors.
The fault was not mine, sir.
Major Lennox must answer.
Major Lennox answered with his life,
as you should have done,
if you had any sense of honor!
You lost the Colors of the King of England
You disgraced us sir You shamed us sir
You will answer
The South Essex is stood down in name.
If I wipe the name, I may wipe the shame.
I am making you a battalion of detachments.
You will fetch and carry
The Light company put up a fight
so I will let it stand
under the command of a new captain.
To be commanded
by the newly gazetted Captain Gibbons, sir?
To be commanded
by the newly gazetted Captain Sharpe, sir.
I have a cousin at Horse Guards, sir...
...and I have friends at Court.
The man who loses the King's Colors...
loses the King's friendship
You have two choices.
To hide in England or be a hero in Spain.
I shall help you to be a hero.
We had a skirmish with the French today
Tomorrow we shall have a battle
You will be the first to see a French column sir
t is not a pretty sight
What you do then, sir, is up to you.
Good morning.
Listen, and listen well.
You both dip into my purse.
That purse is now shut.
It will stay shut so long as Sharpe struts around
sneering at the Simmersons.
You understand me?
Leave Sharpe to me, sir.
Sharpe...
I can make you a captain,
but I cannot keep you a captain.
There is talk about an imperial eagle Sharpe
There is talk of a promise
made to the ate Major Lennox
Tell me on oath that the talk is just idle gossip,
Sharpe,
or by God, sir, I promise
you will walk out of that door a lieutenant.
Sea a
that no-one heard me make any promise
in respect of an imperial eagle to Major Lennox.
- Colonel Lawford.
- Sir?
You may escort Captain Sharpe to the door,
Colonel Lawford.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Hogan...
let the French know that the fool
who lost the Colors is holding our flank.
But, sir, that means sending a French column...
If Hogan's spies can spin a good yarn...
Major Lennox was a damn fine officer.
Did I ever tell you the story
of how he steadied the line at Assaye, Hogan?
No, sir.
You're a damned liar Hogan
That's what you pay me for, sir.
Join me for a drink.
No. I've got to lick the remnants
of the South Essex into shape.
Watch out for Simmerson, Richard.
Simmerson? Simmerson's a fool.
No he’s a coward, not a fool
You make one mistake... You heard Wellesley?
- I heard him.
- Good.
Well, don't brood by yourself.
It's a poor substitute, but if you can't be with her,
you might as well be with your friends.
For an intelligence officer,
Hogan's got a loose mouth.
Well, he asked me to keep an eye on you.
I'll see you in the mess this evening.
Are you and the young Lord twins, or what?
We spent three months chained in a cell in India.
He had a page of the Bible.
In three months,
he taught me how to read and write.
How can you pay back a man who teaches you
to write your own name, Captain?
I say, old chap. Let's have some fun, eh?
A duel.
What's that, old boy?
Nobody can beat me with a pistol at 50 paces.
I've got to make Sharpe call me out. A duel.
Bloody Wellesley don't allow it.
So Sharpe loses even if he wins.
You want a woman, old boy.
Do I?
You know who I want.
That's the woman I had in mind.
Let's call on the Countess, old boy.
That's a good idea.
What about Sharpe?
Sharpe's away playing soldiers.
Snap.
Those men who've fought in a big battle before...
one pace forward.
This place is called Talavera.
There's going to be a battle here tomorrow.
You'll fight in it,
maybe even die in it
But you won't see it.
There's a lot of smoke in a battle.
Our cannon, their cannon.
Our shot their shell
Our volleys, their volleys.
You don't see a battle.
You hear it.
Black powder blasting by the ton on all sides.
Back smoke binding you and choking you
and making you vomit
and the French come out of the smoke
Not in a line but in a column
And they march towards our thin line,
kettledrums hammering like hell,
and a golden eagle blazing overhead.
They march slowly,
and it takes them a long time to reach you
and you can't see them in smoke
but you can hear the drums
They march out of the smoke
and you fire a volley
and the front rank of the column falls
and the next rank steps over them,
with drums hammering.
And the column smashes your line,
like a hammer breaking glass,
and Napoleon has won another battle.
But if you don't run
if you stand
until you can smell the garlic
and fire volley after volley
three rounds a minute
then they slow down,
they stop,
and then they run away.
A you've got to do is stand
and fire three rounds a minute
Now, you and I know
you can fire three rounds a minute.
But can you stand?
Hola, cariño. Quieres pasar un buen rato?
Mira lo que tu pierdes.
Sorry, sir. Sorry.
Bad business, Sharpe.
Berry and Gibbons were here, with a riding crop.
They got out of the window
when they heard us on the stairs.
She's all right, Sharpe.
Josefina...
They treated me like an animal.
But they could not make me do
what they wanted.
We have to stop him.
You can't stop Captain Sharpe, sir.
You can walk away from him
or stand behind him,
but don't ever try and get in his way.
I give you Colonel William Lawford,
one of the future leaders of our great regiment.
Colonel... William... Lawford!
Disgusting Irish bogtrotter.
Do you know, Uncle, I don't think Lawford is Irish.
So, what's happening with Sharpe?
Oh, that's all in hand, Sir Henry.
And I have to say,
it was an absolute pleasure to arrange.
Good.
OFFICER: I say, old man!
Drink, sir?
Thank you.
I don't fight duels over whores.
I do.
Sharpe just threw away his promotion.
My orders are perfectly clear, Lawford.
Dueling is strictly forbidden.
I shall make no exception
in respect of Captain Sharpe.
If he fights Berry at dawn, he will be back
among the ranks before the sun is up.
There is no more to say, sir.
Yes, sir.
French hopping about a bit, Hogan?
Yes, sir.
Send out a patrol to take a look. Not too big.
Eight men, two officers.
I have done so, sir. About an hour ago.
Captain Sharpe and Lieutenant Berry.
That should do the trick, Hogan.
We're a long way from home, sir.
Argh!
Running back to show them the hero's wound,
dear boy?
Argh!
I've decided not to wait till dawn.
I'm going to kill you tonight.
But there's no hurry
want to hear you beg for mercy first
So I'm going to kick you again.
Argh!
And again.
And then you can beg
This is going to hurt quite a bit, old boy.
HARPER: So will this, old boy.
- Agh!
O my God,
I am heartily sorry for having offended thee.
I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace,
nevermore to offend thee,
but to amend my life. Amen.
He won't be able to, Harper.
Able to what, sir?
Amend his life.
He hasn't time.
Maybe you're right.
He'll hardly be needing this, so...
Leroy gets his loan back.
What'll I do with him?
Stick him behind the French pickets.
He'll be among the glorious dead tomorrow.
I think he's gone off, sir.
That bastard was gone off
even when he was alive.
Brandy.
# Here's forty shillings on the drum
# For those who'll volunteer to come
# To 'list and fight the French today
# Over the hills and far away
ALL: # O'er the hills and o'er the main
# Through Flanders, Portugal and Spain
# King George commands, and we obey
# Over the hills
# And far away...
What are you doing down here, sir?
You should be up in the mess
with your own kind.
They're not my own kind, Harper.
The lads want to toast your promotion, sir.
Oh, I haven't got the stomach for it.
We're fighting the French tomorrow.
We could all get killed.
Would you not just put her out of your mind
for one night?
And what man is there
that hath betrothed a wife
and has not taken her?
Let him go...
and return unto his house, lest he die in battle...
and another man take her.
That's Deuteronomy
There's a woman outside
looking for Captain Sharpe, sir.
Oh, every cripple has his own way of walking.
# O'er the hills and o'er the main
# Through Flanders, Portugal and Spain
# King George commands, and we obey
# Over the hills and far away...
Teresa.
Is it true?
Is it true that tomorrow
you will try to take a French eagle?
Lennox died at the bridge.
We lost the Colors.
And I thought you had more sense.
And I thought you knew me better.
You think it's funny to die for an eagle?
I am a soldier.
Would you care...
if I died?
Yes.
Then I shall take care not to.
God, Hogan.
Horse, foot, cannon.
The French outnumber us three to one.
Does he know something I don't?
He knows three things, Lawford. He knows
that on his right
the French will not attack the fort
He knows that on his left
Simmerson will run
and in the center he knows
that Daddy Hi will stand
Means nothing to me, either, Lawford.
That's why he's a general and we ain't
What are your intentions, Sir Arthur?
Why, Hogan...
I mean to give the French
a damn good thrashing.
Hot work, lads.
It were worse yesterday,
when you let off the cannon.
Ah, you're a bloody liar, Dobbs.
Brooding on poor Berry, dear boy?
Death of a hero.
We must all hope to die so bravely.
What the devil's that?
Vive l'Empereur! Vive l'Empereur!
Vive l'Empereur!
Gosh! Oh, my God!
South Essex, fall back, fall back!
South Essex... stand!
SHARPE: Steady, lads!
Steady!
Vive l'Empereur!
Vive l'Empereur!
Now, I know you can fire three rounds a minute...
...but what I want to know now...
...is can you stand?
Vive l'Empereur! Vive l'Empereur!
Three rounds a minute, Captain Leroy.
Chosen Men, to me!
Hey, where are you boys going?
Hey! Denny, you come back here! You hear?
Goddamn!
Boys, let's load up and do some shootin'.
Vive l'Empereur!
First rank, fire!
One.
It'll take six to stop them.
Vive l'Empereur! Vive l'Empereur!
Second rank, fire!
- Two.
- Reload
- Vive l'Empereur!
- First rank, fire!
-
- Second rank, fire!
Y'all doing real good, boys!
First rank fire
Vive l'Empereur! Vive l'Empereur!
Reload!
Second rank...
...fire!
Reload!
First rank, fire!
Free and easy, boys! Fire!
Fire!
Chosen Men!
Whoo! They're runnin', boys!
Yar-har!
Goddammit, Denny!
I told you to stay away from him.
- Dobbs.
- Sir?
Like to join the Rifles, Dobbs?
That I would, sir.
It's a good life...
...if you can stay alive.
HOGAN: We done sir
What a pounding the South Essex gave them
and the advance of the 48tn
Talavera will be the talk of London, sir.
- Hogan...
- Sir?
- Did he?
- Yes, sir.
Pity Lennox ain't here to see it.
Damned fine officer, Major Lennox.
JOSEFINA: Richard.
Did we...
Did Wellesley...
Yes, he won.
He won so well, they made him a lord.
Lord Wellington.
I came to say goodbye, Richard.
What will you do? Where will you go?
Captain Leroy has been very kind.
I'm leaving for Lisbon today.
Vaya con Dios, Josefina.
Why?
I wanted to be confirmed Captain.
I needed an eagle to be certain.
Young Denny...
dead.
All the others. All that blood.
For an eagle?
Slaves, cotton and molasses, you said.
Slaves bleed
All that black blood to fill a purse, sir?
I figured...
I figured maybe...
...you had another reason.
Shave, sir?
Water.
Water?
Jeez, you'll be asking me for brandy next.
Brandy, sir.
Get that into you,
and you'll be fit for an Irish funeral!
Sharpe.
Major Hogan.
As from noon today, Colonel Lawford
will be the beneficiary of Simmerson's folly.
Sir?
He will take over acting command
of the South Essex.
And Simmerson?
War Office whitewash.
Exoneration and a blind eye.
Are you keeping well, Richard?
Aye. I'm mending.
Why?
Richard... Richard...
Your mind has been making appointments
your body should never keep.
What do you mean by that, sir?
You have ambition,
which could be the making of you.
But you also have a romantic soul,
which could be the breaking of you.
Ambition and romance is a poisonous brew...
...and I mean to distil the one from the other.
Are you questioning my loyalty, sir?
I would stand it against yours
Or is it that you see something in me
that you've lost in yourself?
Oh, believe me, Richard. I've drunk of the cup
and its intoxication I can well remember.
I can hold my drink, sir.
See that you do, Sharpe.
See that you do.
Well, you lived.
Just about.
You got what you wanted?
Oh, yes. I did.
And you?
What do you want?
Me?
I want life to be simple again.
Simple?
What do you mean, simple?
Me. Alone.
That simple.
So you want to be alone?
No.
Neither do I.
HARPER: Shoulder... arms!
Present!
Fire!
Shoulder... arms!
Rifles... left face!
Forward... march.
