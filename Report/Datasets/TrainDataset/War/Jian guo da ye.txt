Director Chen, it appears
you will kiss and make up with the CPC.
You don't approve?
You don't know the CPC
like we do.
While you were making passes at them,
we fought them head on
in France.
l heard you intend to resign.
Even if you resign,
wait till after the capitulation
ceremony in Nanjing.
You helped defeat the Japanese.
The ceremony needs a
national hero like you.
lf l don't resign,
l'll be blamed for the civil war.
Welcome, Mr. Mao.
Welcome to Chongqing, Mr. Mao.
We've been fighting the enemy
for 8 years.
lt's my job
to fight till the end.
Now that we won,
why
are we stilling fighting?
l will not
fight my own kind.
General Malinovsky has agreed
to hand over the Northeast provinces.
No need to fight anymore?
lf we don't,
will the CPC hand over their turf?
Ladies and gentlemen.
Chairman Chiang and Mr.
Mao propose a toast.
To peace, cheers.
Cheers.
Chairman Chiang.
Hello, Chairman Chiang.
Hello, Mr. Mao.
l'm from the "Central Daily''.
l notice you're both
wearing Mandarin suit.
On a special day like today,
is there a special meaning for that?
The Mandarin suit
is the official attire for all civil
servants of the Nationalist Government.
As the Chairman
of KMT,
it's my duty
to welcome Mr. Mao to Chongqing.
l'm wearing the Mandarin
suit out of respect.
Mr. Mao, is that your reason too?
The reason is simple.
Chairman Chiang and l are
both Dr. Sun's disciples.
Both the KMT and the
CPC have inherited
Dr. Sun's revolutionary legacy.
We share the same roots.
lt is only natural that
Dr. Sun's disciples should
wear the Mandarin suits.
Mr. Mao. Excuse me.
Pardon me, Mr. Mao.
To see you standing next to each other,
l can't help but feel excited.
l have another question for Mr. Mao.
ln the upcoming negotiation
ith regards to the issue of democracy,
will the Parties find common ground
or reach any consensus?
Definitely, if you look hard enough.
This reporter already noticed
we had something in common.
The North China division of the CPC
and the Shandong division
are infiltrating the Northeast.
Chen Yi's New Fourth Army
is active around
Shanghai and Hangzhou,
making it difficult for the Nationalist
Government to move the capital back to Nanjing.
Our troops are too far
away from these regions.
The Americans have landed in Qingdao.
They promised to send
planes and warships
to get our troops to the
Northeast, North China,
East China and south of Yangtze River.
General Du, l'm counting
on you in the Northeast.
Master Zhang, please give
us your honest opinion.
The CPC
likes to keep things in the open.
We never hide our views
and respect those of our friends
and the China Democratic League.
Sir?
Thank you.
l'll be honest with you, as a friend.
To form a democratic
coalition government,
peace and unity are the
only ways forward.
lf Mr. Chiang and Mr. Mao
can sit down and talk,
it would be wonderful.
A negotiation requires
concessions and compromises
in order to bring about peace.
Chairman Mao came to Chongqing.
That alone proves our sincerity.
The turf and army are minor details.
Rather than haggle over them,
why not unify all the parties?
At this moment,
the Nationalist Army is busy
in regions where we
have set up our regime
with strategic blockades
or explorative attacks.
The Eighth Route Army
and New Fourth Army
are thorns in Mr. Chiang's flesh.
Pardon me for saying this.
lf we didn't have a few
hundred thousand used guns,
Mr. Chiang would never
sit down and talk to us.
Ze.
lf neither Party let go,
the war will go on.
You can forget about peace.
lf neither Party gives in,
negotiation will break down.
l appreciate
your mediation.
Very well.
For the sake of peace and democracy,
we'll make the first concession.
Among the 100 divisions of
the national defense army,
our request for 48 divisions
has been cut back to 20 divisions.
We're willing to give
up 8 liberated regions
in south of Yangtze River.
l hope that our concession
will set the consultative
meeting in motion
and help set up a coalition government.
l'm here on behalf of President Truman
and the United States government
to issue the following statement.
We have no intention to support
a "Cream of Wheat'' Marxist
to take over China.
The present Nationalist Government
of China and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek
are faithful friends of the United States.
Our only concern is
whether the Yalta Conference and
the Sino-Russian
Friendship Alliance Treaty
will be honored and implemented
by the Chongqing government.
The United States is cognizant that
the Nationalist government of
China is a one-party government
and believes that peace, unity
and democratic reform in China
can be furthered if the
basis of this government
is broadened to include
other political elements in the country.
On behalf of the CPC, l wish to
issue the following statement.
We welcome President Truman's China
policy as per the declaration on the 15th
with regards to the cease fire
between the KMT, CPC
and other political parties
and to call upon a multi-party meeting
to implement reforms
to end the KMT's one-party dictatorship
and to ensure fair and
effective representation of all parties
to facilitate the democratic
unification of China.
President Truman's special envoy,
Marshall, is arriving soon
to mediate in the civil war.
Don't slight him.
Peace or war,
you should know better.
Stop when we want to stop.
Fight when we want to fight.
This is the only case.
Not until we say so.
The purpose of this Assembly
is to seek political
reforms towards democracy.
The basis of our negotiation
is to establish a multi-party
coalition government
to facilitate a peaceful unification.
Kai,
there are over 30 seats in the Senate.
We have to give up 8 of them?
To give up 8 seats
is to oust 8 of our men
and hand them to someone else.
Who owns the world
now? lt's hardly KMT.
Father.
Central Club and the others
have secretly agreed
not to acknowledge the CPPCC
and refused to give up their
seats for the CDL and CPC.
There'll be trouble
if they keep this up.
Fellow students, teachers
and friends of Sichuan.
to celebrate a national victory.
That's outrageous. Lower your whip.
Mind your own business.
She's my girl.
You have no say.
Whoever feeds her,
owns her.
Hey. Stop it.
Are you alright, Miss?
Who fired that shot? Who was it?
Who was it? Who fired that shot?
Sir.
No open fire in the city, Sir.
But they can beat people up?
l don't care who you work for.
Send a message for me.
Don't sneak around.
Stop this underhanded nonsense.
Extra: Mr. Chiang calls for a meeting.
Newspaper.
Here.
Chiang has taken the gloves off.
He's calling the National
People's Congress without us.
lt's his one-man show.
The sooner we set the date for the NPC,
the sooner the US will
confirm their assistance.
We can't have the NPC
with the KMT alone.
We can forget the CPC.
For appearance, we still
have the other parties.
The CPC and the other parties
insisted on implementing the
resolution of the CPPCC in Chongqing.
What will you do?
Pacify Zhang Lan.
Coax and fight the CPC
at the same time.
When Mao runs out of troops,
we can stop coaxing.
was murdered by secret
agents of the KMT.
What crime has he committed
to deserve such a fate?
He used his pen and he spoke up.
Everything he wrote and said
was precisely what any
Chinese with a conscience
should write and speak of.
What a shame.
The counter-revolutionaries' shame
is precisely Mr. Li's honor.
His blood will not be shed in vain.
Mr. Li gave up his life.
There's a price to be paid for his life.
Justice will prevail,
because truth will prevail.
We want democracy, not civil war.
Tell him l went out.
Sir.
The Chairman is not here for real.
He sent me on an overseas expedition.
l came to say goodbye
to my sworn brother.
But he's not here.
Vice President, why the lantern?
lt's broad daylight.
Daylight?
l see only darkness.
l can't see without a lantern.
You must be kidding, Sir.
l'm not in the mood.
"'The Three Principles of the People''
is the cornerstone of our Party.
lf he's bent on having his way,
the days of our Party are numbered.
That's all l have to say.
Tell him to take care.
Zhangjiakou is the capital of the
Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region,
it's also the only major
city under the CPC
that has an arsenal that's crucial to them.
But it'll be returned to the
Nationalist Government soon.
General, are you saying
the manufacturing and
military base of the CPC
doesn't exist any more?
l admire Mao for never giving up.
But talk is cheap
and you can't just work
your finger to the bone.
Power is everything.
According to you,
the Communist Party is
doomed to fail this time?
l didn't say that.
l'll make you a wager.
The CPC wins,
l'm willing to hold Mao's horsewhip.
we surrendered our arms
for peace.
What happened? We got
a massacre in return,
not peace.
We learn from our mistakes.
For peace,
for our future and to eliminate war.
ln this war imposed
on us by our enemies,
we must retaliate.
Within 3 months of the
closing of this NPC,
our government
will put an end to this civil war.
We will annihilate the separatist
regime by force of arms
to bring forth a unified country
and bring peace to our nation.
Some say the evacuation from Yan'an
marks a major setback in
the Chinese Revolution.
lf this is a setback,
our party and this army
have survived countless setbacks.
You keep the land and lose
the people, you lose both.
You keep the people and lose
the land, you have both.
l'll trade Yan'an for the whole of China.
We came all this way
but we're still one step away from peace.
What a shame to give it up.
Mao was right: without
guns in their hands,
Chiang will never negotiate with us.
The CDL served as mediator
between the KMT and CPC.
But Chiang is insatiable.
The CPC gave up their turf,
but they did not get
the peace they wanted.
Some guarantor l am.
Chiang wants a one-party NPC.
lf neither the CPC or CDL shows up,
we'll be handing the regime to him.
Don't be stupid.
We'll fall into his trap if we show up.
Our position is clear.
Only a coalition government is legal.
There'll be no NPC without peace
and no coalition government
without political consultancy.
You're saying...
We side with the CPC.
l, Zhang Lan,
will not attend Chiang's NPC.
Based on the experience
of the Northeast Bureau,
we implement land reforms
in the countryside.
The results are quite obvious.
Stay off the main road, take
the vicinity of the city,
give the land to the farmers.
We'll take over when those who
plough the land can own it.
The supplies unit got separated.
We have problems with food and clothes.
Zedong.
Mr. Chairman.
l need to write an editorial
for the Xinhua News Agency.
l need the rest of this candle for later.
But we're having a meeting.
Precisely, just keep talking.
You don't need to see anything.
Groping in the dark?
Let's get back to business.
Chiang threw caution to the
wind and declared war.
Bullets don't have eyes.
ln my opinion,
Enlai, Bishi and l
will form a front committee
and stay in Shanbei.
Shaoqi, you and Zhu De form
a Central Working Committee
and cross the Yellow
River into North China.
We'll work from both sides.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Keep them separate.
We'll still have the other
when one is crushed.
Hurry. Get out.
Get rid of everyone inside.
Seal up this place.
That son of a bitch.
He had the audacity to
seize the CDL headquarters
and restrict our activities.
Li Jishen and He Xiangning
set up the Revolutionary Committee
of the KMT in Hong Kong.
Founding members such as
Feng Yuxiang and Cai Tingkai
have indicated their intention
to break away from Chiang.
The KMT is splitting up.
You should leave for
Hong Kong right away.
We'll re-open the CDL
headquarters in Hong Kong.
But...
l'm all for it.
We must not miss this chance.
l hereby announce
the results of the first presidential
election of the Republic of China
with the following votes:
Chiang Kai-shek 2, 430 votes;
Ju Zheng 269 votes.
According to the constitution
of the ROC and electoral law,
l hereby announce
Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is elected
first President of the ROC.
Congratulations.
Congrats.
Hu Zongnan wired. We lost Yan'an.
Chiang Kai-shek was elected
President in Nanjing.
Long live Mao Zedong in the valley.
Nothing to brag about.
Get rid of the 'long live'
in clause 23 of the slogan.
Let Chiang be the emperor.
l won't join his party.
Clause 5,
mere mention of the working
class is inappropriate.
We have insisted on a
coalition government.
lt's bad to sing a different tune.
l agree with the amendments.
Let's have a show of hands.
Go on air with this.
Xinhua Radio broadcasts
the CPC slogan for Labor Day on May 1.
First, this year's Labor Day
is the day the Chinese
people head towards victory.
Second, this year's Labor Day
is the day the Chinese
people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek
meets his doom.
Fifth, all democratic
parties and organizations
should immediately call for the CPPCC
to discuss and elect delegates
to set up a coalition government.
The CPC made an excellent move.
You're the chess expert.
This time you must make up your mind.
lt's easier said than done.
lt'll depend on the CPC's next move.
l heard Li Zongren had
invited you to Nanjing.
Chiang wants you too.
Li Zongren.
Sun Ke.
Li Zongren.
lf the President is a litearati,
l don't mind if you
become Vice President.
But the President is already a soldier.
The Vice President should
not be another soldier.
People will say this is
a military government.
Normally, l won't insist if you say so.
But since the election,
more than my effort is at stake.
Not that l don't want to step down,
l simply can't.
Without support from the Party,
you won't be elected.
Why be a laughing stock?
Let the numbers speak for themselves.
Maybe l'll win.
Definitely not.
Sun Ke 1,295 votes.
Li Zongren 1,438 votes.
According to the constitution
of the ROC and electoral law,
l hereby announce, Mr. Li Zongren
is elected Vice President of the ROC.
l
do solemnly swear...
l haven't been to Beiping in years.
Commander-in-Chief of North China.
thousand people under your command.
You're the king.
Don't make fun of me.
Mr. Chiang has high regard for you.
lf the new CPPCC
can invite half the people on this list,
we're half way there.
You're right.
You better write to
General Feng personally.
l'll do that right now.
Mr. Chairman, time to eat.
Please join me, Enlai.
No, l must get back to Xibaipo.
Finish eating first.
Very well.
Mr. Chairman,
the cook is Xiao Yan's old lad.
He wants to see you.
Of course.
Thank you, sir.
Hurry.
His name is Guo Bencai.
He's from my hometown.
Hello, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Kwok, you're a good cook.
lt's worth everything to cook for you.
Have a smoke.
Thank you, sir.
Why...
lt's your cigarette, l want to keep it.
Take this.
l can't.
Take it.
Sir, this is Liu Congwen, the mess
officer in the military zone.
Hello, sir.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Zhou.
Hello. Mr. Kwok.
Hello.
Mr. Chairman, any special
requests for your meals?
We'll do the best we can.
l don't need much.
Make sure we put in chili.
l prepared for you already.
lt'd be perfect
if l can have stewed meat twice a month.
Big fish in Chengnanzhuang
In a bungaIow between 2 apricot trees near the
mountains in the northern part of the viIlage
Per your request,
field operation units
in Nanjing, Shanghai and
Hong Kong have been removed.
Zhang Lan is stuck in Shanghai.
Keep him under tabs.
Yes, sir.
Li Jishen is in Hong Kong.
He's not on our turf.
Just keep an eye on him.
Yes, sir.
As for Feng Yuxiang,
he's getting tight with the CPC.
He may defect.
lf necessary,
l'll tidy things up a bit.
These are prestigious men.
lf you're sloppy,
public opinion overseas
will backfire on us.
l understand.
Mao's location is confirmed?
Chengnanzhuang in Baoding.
He won't get away this time.
Remember, this is extremely important.
Confirm target, roger.
Lao Guo, where are
you going? This way.
Back to the kitchen. Chairman
Mao's food is on the stove.
Chairman?
He took some sleeping
pills and went to sleep.
Wake him up. Enemy planes
will be here soon.
Tiger, get a stretcher.
Wake up, sir. Enemy planes are coming.
They haven't dropped a bomb.
Then it'll be too late.
Let's go, sir.
Calm down.
Cigarette.
Do that later.
Commander Nie.
Move Mr. Chairman to the bomb
shelter on the stretcher.
Yes, sir.
Even if they start bombing,
that doesn't mean they'll hit me.
l'm responsible for the Party.
l'm very lucky.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Hello...
Well?
Still can't get through.
Keep trying.
Yes, sir.
Telegram, sir.
Massive bombings, casualties unknown.
The food was still on the stove
when the bombing started.
Lao Guo said you have
not eaten breakfast.
He ran back to the kitchen.
Telegram, Mr. Zhou.
Mr. Chairman,
we have very positive response
for the May 1 slogan.
The Parties have all signed their names.
Already?
What a surprise.
The situation is becoming clear.
The CDL and the Revolutionary
Committee are on our side.
Chiang is now completely isolated.
Everything will fall into place.
lt's time to call for a new CPPCC.
Jishen, Mao wrote you personally.
What's your concern?
Back in Fujian, we
agreed to oppose Chiang.
But they changed their minds.
Fujian was a few years ago.
That was Bo Gu, not Mao.
l'm not holding a grudge.
l don't need another fall.
Chiang toyed with us for decades.
No doubt the CPC has better credibility,
but what if...
We just set up a new Party.
As the Chairman of Revolutionary
Committee of the KMT,
l must do my best
for the future of the Party.
lssue a separate declaration
to oppose Chiang.
Reiterate our opposition
against one-party autocracy.
That'll be our response to the CPC.
Nowhere inside the Shanhai Pass
is a suitable venue for the
new consultative meeting,
except Harbin.
lt's far away,
but at least it's a big city.
Feng Yuxiang will be home this month.
He'll go directly to the Northeast.
Then let's settle for Harbin.
To build a new government
for the whole country
without a decent big city,
it's just not adequate.
Goods are scarce. Commodities
entered the black market.
Everyone is buying
and selling short.
The top brass in the military
and political circles
are behind these activities.
Those profiteers
defy government orders.
Mr. Weng can't hold the fort much longer.
What's your solution?
l don't want your complaints.
l want a solution.
As the financial center in the Far East,
Shanghai is the key.
lf we can stabilize the
market in Shanghai,
the rest of the country will fall in line.
l must go to Shanghai.
Master Chiang, on behalf of Shanghai,
we're hosting a banquet for
you at the Jinjiang Hotel.
l'll pick you up later.
Tell everyone on the
Special Commando Unit
to meet in my office in half an hour,
including you.
ln preparing for the new CPPCC,
the CPC is open for suggestions.
They don't intend to run the whole show.
They do things differently
from the Nanjing government.
What about Zhang Lan?
He's always for building
the state via CPPCC.
They already have a
well thought-out plan
to escort you and my mother up north.
Mao invited you and Li Jishen up north
to discuss re-opening the CPPCC.
When is Li Jishen leaving?
Don't know yet.
What's your answer?
l have decided
to stay put.
But...
Let Shen Junru liaise with the
CPC on behalf of the CDL.
When are you leaving?
l'm too old and sick.
Besides, Chiang won't
let me go that easily.
How can you not show for
something this important?
l'm putting Shen Junru in charge.
l am Chinese.
ls that right, Father?
One stroke is missing.
lsn't this pretty, Uncle Mao?
Yes, but you can't eat everything.
Mr. Chairman, it's time for the meeting.
Let's go back.
Will you carry me, Uncle Mao?
Carry me, Father.
Will you carry me, Uncle Mao? Father
Liya, do you want me to carry you?
Yes.
Let's go.
Any news, Enlai?
Chiang's economic reform is a deadlock.
Chiang Ching-kuo personally
flew to Shanghai.
But the Bund is entrenched
with powerful factions.
lt's a labyrinth within the KMT.
Chiang's son won't accomplish anything.
Liya, let's play piggyback.
Let's go.
No one should doubt the Government's
determination to implement
financial reforms.
ln face of a national crisis,
anyone who compromises
the nation's interest
is a traitor
and an enemy of the KMT.
l urge the elite of the business sector
and prominent individuals
of society to work with us
to restore financial order
and stabilize prices
in the shortest time possible
and do your best to save our country.
Mr. Chiang.
Will you be fair?
What about those offenders
who have influence?
How will you handle them?
My mission in Shanghai
is to hunt tigers, not squat mosquitoes.
Mr. Chiang, can you tell us
your concrete course of action?
Tigers are easy to hunt
but l'm afraid icebergs
are hard to remove.
You are...
Du Yuesheng.
Mr. Du, l'm all ears.
My son Weiping has been arrested.
lf he broke the law, l have no complaints,
but someone else in Shanghai
is hoarding supplies
and peddling them to the
black market for profits,
openly defying the law.
lf you choose to overlook this,
President Chiang will
be very disappointed.
Please point me in the
right direction, Mr. Du.
l will look into it.
Read it.
The godown on No. 36 Nanjing Road.
No. 17 Avenue Joffre.
Market using the word "Jia.''
Mr. Chiang,
this is the real tiger.
Who is it?
Yangtze Company owned by the Kung's.
Wire Wei Lihuang, urge
him to pull back south.
With crack troops like these,
even if we lose the Northeast,
we can get it back easily.
President, we wired him several times
urging him to go south,
but he ignored us.
Get my plane ready,
l'll fly out to Shenyang.
The President.
What is it?
Feng Yuxiang is dead.
What happened to you?
You bragged about your abilities.
You bragged about Shanghai.
You bragged about the
Red Army. And now?
General Feng was burned to death.
You.
This is all you can do.
Think it over. You won't get away.
You'll be executed if you lose a battle.
Now something went
wrong on your front.
Tell me what you should do. Speak up.
KMT secret agents did it?
According to the Russians,
General Feng was watching
a film in his cabin.
The film caught on fire
and ignited the cabin.
The film caught on fire? He's a general.
Why didn't he run?
What a bunch of morons.
A man is dead, the Russians
need to blame someone.
The ship was out at sea and abroad.
We didn't get all the facts.
General Feng became a soldier at 12.
But our invitation
to send him abroad buried him at sea.
l feel so guilty.
General Feng may be dead
but he left behind a legacy
to build a new, independent China.
Enlai, wire our condolences
to Madame Feng
and invite her to the CPPCC.
Yes.
Mr. Chairman, it has been suggested
that the CPPCC should act for the NPC
to elect the central government.
A general election is hard
to come by during the war.
We must consult all the
other Parties on this.
Let's not waste any time.
Form the coalition government
first, then call the NPC,
is that it?
Precisely.
They're still in a war.
They can't elect their delegates.
We should make allowances for that.
l'll get in touch with Shen Junru
and pass on your message.
Mr. Mao and Mr. Zhou invited
you up north again.
Assemble.
Hurry.
Search all the godowns,
buildings, apartments and villas
in Shanghai owned by Yangtze
Company and the Kung's.
Operation starts at 7 am
tomorrow morning, understand?
Mr. Chairman.
Voices within the US
government have indicated
they will support your
replacement of Mr. Chiang.
What do you think?
Whether they support me or Chiang,
it's a cheap trick to pit
Chinese against Chinese.
lf the US wishes to maintain diplomatic
relations with the future China,
ignoring the CPC
is unrealistic.
The second question.
lf Vice President Li
replaced President Chiang,
will things get better?
ln terms of warfare,
Bai Chongxi is quite capable.
ln terms of politics,
Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi
together are no match for Chiang.
You did not answer my question, sir.
Here.
What are you looking at?
Jinzhou.
That's over 1,000 km away.
More definite news won't
arrive until tomorrow.
lt's already 10:30 and yet no sign
of attack. Which division was it?
The 8th column.
You asked me 5 times already.
Really?
The Battle of Jinzhou is not
just over a city or a region.
lf we win, we can go on.
lf we lose, the situation gets complicated.
With regards to the draft
agenda of the CPPCC,
Zhang Lan and Shen Junru
made minor changes.
They know we're at war.
They're being very understanding.
Zhang Lan is sick.
We should postpone his trip up north.
We must invite him.
But we'll let him decide
when to come.
We'll wait.
Aunt, he has full authority
to seize everything owned
by the Yangtze Company.
He put out word all over
Shanghai looking for me.
Now l finally see him.
That ought to save him some trouble.
Have you gone mad, David?
Relax. He's the Liaison
Administrator, the prince.
l wouldn't dare shoot the prince.
This is very simple, cousin.
Shoot me and it's all over.
With the culprit dead, you'll
be famous in Shanghai.
We'll both get what we want.
Ching-kuo.
lt's clearly written in the state papers.
You're needed for
questioning within 10 days
or you'll be severely punished.
decide what to do next.
Yangtze Company is our family estate.
l dare you to arrest my father.
Nonsense. lt's clearly your fault.
Leave your father out of this.
lf he and Ai-ling found out
about your monkey business,
they won't spare you.
This is how we do business in Shanghai.
But the arrival of a Liaison
Administrator changed all that.
Auntie, everyone does it. That's the rule.
Only a feudalistic dictator
would run a business without rules.
Who are you calling a dictator?
The government is fighting a war and
soldiers are dying on the front.
But the state treasury is empty and
we had to borrow from the Americans.
Currency has depreciated and
prices have skyrocketed.
People are running scared.
But inside your godowns,
you hoarded over 100
thousand tons of supplies
which you are unwilling to sell.
l'm a businessman, not a philanthropist.
The CPC is working on land reforms
and political consultation.
Even Cai Tingkai and Shen Junru
have left for the Northeast.
Mao is setting up his own government.
Madame, you've always
supported Father.
l bet you never expected
right here in Shanghai,
someone is undermining him,
destroying the foundation of this country.
Their fortune, apartments,
clothes, perfumes and
iceboxes are like a virus
residing on the mere
skeleton of this country.
They are the enemy,
Father's and the state's.
That's enough,
Ching-kuo.
There are no enemies here, only family.
Let's talk about family today.
l'm not in the position to say anything.
He Yingqin is the Director
of National Defense.
Take pains to stay save.
Let Chiang talk to him.
You're a better marksman
than He Yingqin.
So what?
Chiang owns China now.
Even this gun has his
name engraved on it.
What can we do about it?
The CPC troops use this type of rifle too.
What matters is not the name on the rifle,
but the man who uses it.
Holding a rifle
beats holding an empty title of
Director of National Defense.
lf you're the President,
will the Americans back us up?
Stuart dropped a hint.
Then let's get rid of Chiang.
lt's still too early to say.
Never too early to take precautions.
lt's time we get started.
Ching-kuo, Madam is leaving
for the US tomorrow
to ask President Truman for help.
The situation in the Northeast
is deteriorating quickly.
We need help from the Americans.
l flew back from the Northeast
just to tell you,
at a time like this
we can't afford a fire in the backyard.
Father.
lf we don't punish the Kung's,
the economy in Shanghai is doomed.
l absolutely understand.
The corruption of the
KMT is in the bones.
lt's not just the problem of the Kung's.
Crackdown on corruption
is a major issue.
Timing and extent are crucial...
it's tough.
You lose the Party if you proceed.
You lose the country if you don't.
lt's tough.
Father.
Both the Party and the country
are on the brink of disaster.
Alright.
The matter at hand
is to move the troops up North
to south of the Yangtze River
to ensure the safety there.
Going after the Kung's
is meaningless now.
Zhang Lan is truly a saint of Sichuan.
He deserves it.
Without him at the CPPCC,
none of us Sichuanese
would dare to go.
The Northeast is too
cold for a man his age.
He probably can't make it.
lf anything happens to him...
What about Beiping?
What?
Postpone the meeting till next year.
Move the venue to Beiping.
lt's possible.
The troops are tired
after taking Shenyang.
Fu Zuoyi commands 600,000 men.
Relying on 2 divisions in the
Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region
to capture Beiping is impossible.
According to our intelligence
lately, Fu Zuoyi is
having second thoughts.
After the failed attempt on Shijiazhuang,
he seems willing to negotiate.
Send someone reliable to liaise with him.
Ok.
lt'd be heavenly, if we can
liberate Beiping peacefully.
Fu's daughter Dongju is a Party member.
She's perfect for the job.
Yes.
ln that case, l'll be the
dictator for a change.
Ask the Northeast Field Army to enter
the Shanhai Pass within 7 days.
Tell Lin Biao
this is an order and not a probe.
lt'll take a few days
to gather up the troops
and each column needs
time to adjust otherwise.
Moving inside the Pass
will be a problem.
The cadres don't want to make the move
and it'll take time for deployment.
The deadline on the 22nd is too tight.
Wire this back: Received order
dispatched on 18th at 18:00.
Will set out on the 22nd as instructed.
Details to follow. Signed, Lin, Luo & Liu.
You should think for yourself too.
You really want me
to hold the horsewhip for your Chairman?
Forget it, Father. lt was a joke.
A joke?
l personally told the American reporter.
lt's not a joke.
That's because you took it to heart.
Li Jishen is a founding member of the
Party who opposes Chiang openly.
Over these last few months,
Mao has repeatedly invited him up north.
He's been stalling him.
He's bewildered by
You come to see me
with a 18-year old newspaper.
How kind of you.
The quarrel between
you and the President
should stay within the Party.
Between you and the CPC,
don't forget you ordered the
execution of Cai Hesen.
What are you saying?
Return to Nanjing and
pick any job you want,
as long as you don't join the CPC.
A promotion for a promise?
You think l'll go?
Before l came, Vice President Li told me
he would like to liaise
with the CPC through you.
Any condition is negotiable,
including using the
Yangtze as a partition.
Use the Yangtze as a partition
and split up China?
Tell Li Zongren.
The infamy is more than he can handle.
Hello, Mr. President.
Commander Fu.
Our troops can pull back
to Tanggu and Zhangjiakou.
l can't guarantee we'll win.
But we're perfectly capable of defense.
With the big picture in mind.
l intend to move 600,000
men to Jiangnan.
l can be more flexible in
both defense and offense.
That's containing our
sovereignty to the southeast.
As the old capital, Beiping
has political significance.
Giving it up
is unfavorable to our
government internationally.
You're right. lnternational
scope is the situation.
Wait.
What is it, Father?
Who's your commanding officer?
We agreed not to discuss that.
l wish to talk to them.
About what? The horsewhip?
What l'm telling you now
will determine the lives of millions.
l understand.
She's so hot.
l'm sorry, May-ling.
Both the House and the Congress
have refused your request
to make another speech.
But the Government will still
support the General as before
with the hope that the civil war does
not continue any longer in China.
President Truman and his administration
is concentrating on Europe.
But the East needs a revival too.
My friend.
China should have been
included in your plan.
Any loans and assistance
from the US now
should be spent on security
and constructive activities,
not war.
You got 400 million dollars
from the original loan.
That's still in existence.
We both know there's only a
few million dollars left.
And it's not enough to support
my husband's administration
and his life's work.
Mr. Secretary of State,
we need your additional assistance,
please.
Madam, there's nothing more we can do.
New Year is coming up.
Make this announcement at month end.
About what?
lf they want me to resign, l'll resign.
You can't do that, Mr. President.
lt's not my choice.
But someone within our
Party wants me out.
You repeatedly rejected Mao
and Zhou's invitation.
You're too arrogant.
That's an overstatement, Madame Liao.
l'm tied up at home.
And l'm also busy with military affairs.
Preparations for the new CPPCC are
moving along and days are counting.
After decades, the KMT can't be absent.
You're still hesitant about going.
You expect Mao to fly to
Nanjing to invite Chiang?
We're definitely not inviting him.
He's a war criminal, a murderer.
We can't have a CPPCC
without the KMT.
Jishen, Chairman Mao said
he'd wait for you in Beiping.
Chief, some landlord's
compound up ahead.
The wall is too high for us to climb over.
Grenades won't blow it apart.
Please send for the artillery.
Flare.
Flare.
Commander...
we have reached Beiping city.
Li Jishen, Shen Yanbing
and Zhang Naiqi
left 4 days ago.
They boarded the Aldan and will
disembark at Dalian day after tomorrow.
And the other one?
Chiang Kai-shek resigned.
Mr. Ambassador.
As China's ally,
why is the US doing nothing
at a time like this?
God help those who help
themselves, my friend.
l think Chiang is giving
Li Zongren a hard time.
He knows Li wants to negotiate,
so he brought it up first.
He doesn't want Li to get the credit
and he wants to give us a hard time.
He already stepped down, but he
had to pull a stunt like this.
After this,
it would be tough for Li to talk to us.
The CDL and the other Parties
have yet to make a stand,
they're waiting to see.
ln my opinion,
deep down
they want us to talk.
Li Zongren wants peace, we want peace,
the other Parties want peace.
We'll do the Acting President a favor.
Great.
Let's give him a chance to talk,
but we decide how.
Victory bulletin...
War communique from Huaihai.
According to the wire,
and Du Yuming was captured.
What about the New 5th and the 18th?
Gone.
The 5 major divisions were wiped out.
Chiang is finished for good.
There'll be no more fighting
north of the Yangtze.
Cheers.
This is the last battle.
We stay united till tomorrow.
"lnternationale''
will come true.
This is the last battle.
We stay united till tomorrow.
"lnternationale'' will come true.
Father, it's cold on the ground.
Sit down.
Ching-kuo.
You did a good job in
Shanghai. l'm very pleased.
l made Chen Cheng Governor of Taiwan.
Do you know why?
Your route of retreat?
Yes, Du Yuming's men were wiped out.
l lost all the men who can fight.
We can't count on the 1 million
men we captured in Jiangnan.
They can barely hold their rifles.
The Yangtze is lost.
You intend to evacuate to Taiwan?
You're coming too.
You think Li Zongren won't get anywhere
with the CPC over the
peace negotiations?
lf we can't defeat them at war,
we won't beat them at
the conference table.
Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi thought
the CPC will settle for using
the Yangtze as a partition.
They don't know Mao Zedong.
Mao will never agree to
separate governments on
both sides of the Yangtze?
Would you accept if it were you?
That'd depend on the US and the USSR...
Don't make it so complicated. lt
doesn't matter what anyone thinks.
China was split into north
and south in the past
but not today.
Who would want to be blamed for it?
Definitely not me.
Mr. Zhang Lan.
Right now, in your opinion,
will the CPC accept the
Government's plea for peace?
lmpossible.
Why is that?
lf Chiang never gives up his
so-called constitution,
The CPC will not recognize it
and neither will the people.
You know Mao Zedong and
Zhou Enlai very well.
Are they local revolutionaries
or mere agents working for international
communist intelligence bureau?
What kind of question is that?
l want to know your view.
My view is that the CPC
catered for the people
which explains their achievements today.
Achievements?
Yes, achievements.
Dear Zuoyi.
You and l have come a long way.
Given the circumstances, you took
matters into your own hands.
There's nothing l can do about
that, but l have one request.
l will send planes to Beiping tomorrow
to airlift officers of the 13th
Army ranked Major or above
and essential weaponry.
On account of our long standing
friendship, please help me out.
Chiang Chung-cheng .
Beiping fell. Fu Zuoyi surrendered.
The CPC is moving in on
the Yangtze and Nanjing.
With regards to my plea for peace,
the CPC accepted it
but raised 8 very harsh conditions.
Madame, if you speak on
behalf of the Government,
Mao and Zhou may trust me.
As you know, Mr. Acting President,
l washed my hands in politics
since the onset of the civil war.
There are rumors in the newspapers
about me coming out of retirement.
The Trust had to issue a denial.
Madame.
Dr. Sun founded the KMT.
You can't sit back and
watch it go to ruin.
Don't forget, you may be
the Acting President,
but Chiang Kai-shek is
still the Party Chairman.
Looks like the Acting President
is having a hard time.
Chiang stepped down in name only.
He still has control of everything.
Li Zongren does not
have enough authority.
He's only a puppet.
Nothing will come out of the negotiation.
No wonder you turned him down.
l don't want to go to Beiping
because Dr. Sun died
there. Too many memories.
Master Zhang, you're a
veteran of the United League
and Zhu De's mentor.
Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu
have great respect for you.
The Acting President issued a
declaration for peace negotiation.
You're the most suitable
person to mediate.
lf the CPC brought up 8 conditions,
go ahead and talk to them.
lf Mao wants to talk,
he wouldn't raise these harsh conditions.
There should be room to
negotiate in a negotiation.
That's why the Acting President
sent me to haggle with them.
To mediate.
As you know, the Government
clamped down on the CDL.
l'm now in the same party
as the Communists.
Please don't be upset, sir.
Mr. Chiang issued that order,
not the Acting President.
l side with the revolutionary.
l won't haggle for the enemy.
Sir.
See them out.
A partitioned rule? China is not Korea.
The Yangtze is not the 38th Parallel.
Wire the General Front Committee.
Their war plan has been approved.
The central government advises to
move the plan up to end of April.
Go
Hurry. Are you ok?
Don't push
Lin Biao is still so skinny.
Eating 1 million Nationalist soldiers
didn't even make him fat.
Comrades.
On behalf of the Secretariat of the
Central Politburo, l hereby announce
the commencement of
the second meeting
of the 7th CPC Central Committee.
What should we do about Zhang Lan?
He'd rather die than go to Taiwan.
He's trouble to us if he stays.
Give him what he wants.
Sir.
Get rid of Zhang Lan.
He's a man of influence, sir.
The more reason to get rid of him.
l see.
Openly or privately?
How can you do this openly?
Like l said, don't let me see him alive.
And no body if he's dead.
Don't make a mess.
l understand.
Go on.
Take care.
Stop.
Get out.
Are you Zhang Lan?
Who are you?
What do you want?
Deputy Chief Yan Jinwen of
the Shanghai lnspectorate.
On behalf of the CPC, l will get you out.
Trust me.
Brother Yan.
Morning, you're on duty?
Security has been tightened lately.
Where are you going?
On lnspectorate business.
Mixing pleasure with business.
My father is in the car.
Go ahead, do what you have to.
No need, run along.
Bye.
Let them through.
Where are you taking us?
Up north.
Enlai, where's the Chairman?
Went to get smokes.
Not a shop is open in two blocks.
Chengjun, you're the county
committee secretary.
This can't go on.
After entering the city, rumor has it
capitalists and businessmen
are exploiters
and we should punish them.
They're so scared no one
is open for business.
This is not a small matter.
Revolution is our forte
but not economics.
Can't even get smokes
without the merchants,
let alone market prosperity.
We need the capitalists back.
At this stage, we can't
eliminate them yet.
Production must be handled with care.
lf anything goes wrong,
it'll be worse than losing a battle.
We must know our limits.
We must learn from scratch.
The gist of political consultation
involves capitalists and
democracy activists.
We invite them to help run the country,
not to eliminate them.
We must be very clear on
this: if we destroy them
and we can't run production on our own,
factories will close down and
worker will lose their jobs.
We'll be smashing our own rice bowls.
We barely got our hands on
them, don't smash them.
Comrades, we ask two things of you.
Keep your backs straight and
your voices up, understand?
Yes.
Chairman Mao.
General Fu, you flatter me.
l promised to hold your
horsewhip if l lose.
Today, l'll hold the door for you.
You did not lose. The loser is in Nanjing.
Don't hold the door for me.
Help me open the door for a new China.
Salute.
Sir.
l'm with the 28th Army.
l'm here with the Tashan troops
to join the dress parade.
On behalf of
soldiers of the Red Army, dead or alive,
l salute you, Chairman Mao.
Forward...
Forward...
Forward...
Long live Chairman Mao.
Are these the 100,000 used guns
you mentioned in Chongqing
three years ago?
The CPC has come a long way.
Long live Chairman Mao.
Long live Commander Zhu.
Long live Chairman Mao.
Long live Commander Zhu.
Long live Chairman Mao.
Since they're crossing the
Yangtze River anyway,
what the hell is the point of negotiation?
To surrender before the fight begins?
l'm a soldier, l won't do it.
The CPC knew you're
different from Chiang.
Mao knows you enjoy being in the army.
He personally told me you might
continue to command the troops
up to as many as 400,000.
Nonsense. l'm already the
Minister of National Defense.
Zongren, we don't get along with Chiang.
That's our internal business.
lt's not up to the Communists
to jack us around.
What's the use of saying that now?
What are you suggesting then?
Let's wait for word from Xikou.
crossed the Yangtze River on the 21st.
The campaign started at
midnight on the 20th.
Didn't even hold the
defense line for one day.
He Yingqin is retreating.
They say to Guangzhou.
Shall we go with them?
l have to look after the
interests of the United States.
l should stay here in Nanjing.
l heard the Soviet embassy
had relocated to Guangzhou
with the Government.
Morning, Madam. Morning
The sound of gunfire went on
all night. lt finally stopped.
Madam, you didn't sleep well.
l'll go for a walk.
Have you decided to leave?
Really?
Hello, Chairman Mao.
Hello, Chairman Mao.
Hello. Jishen.
Mr. Zhou. This way, please.
Chairman, Zhang Lan is here.
Mr. Mao, you flatter me.
Not at all.
Master Zhang, how are you? Mr. Zhou.
Welcome, please come this way.
Hello, Master Zhang.
Calling the CPPCC to establish
a new people's Government,
l recommend you both
for Vice Presidents.
l'd like to hear your opinion.
l'll go along with your arrangement.
You have something to say?
ls this your idea?
The Central Committee's idea.
l killed members of your party.
That was then, this is now.
All roads lead to Rome.
We can't change history.
Nobody's perfect.
A personal matter, no matter how
important, is a minor issue.
A state matter, no matter how trivial,
is a major issue, For the new state,
be our Vice President on behalf
of the Revolutionary Committee.
This is a state matter.
Forget the past.
The CPC is willing to work
with you to lead this country.
Let's help each other, as
we're in the same boat now.
Together, we'll make history.
As you wish.
l'll do my best for China.
We strongly urge our comrades in China
to set up their own government soon.
The USSR will, at the
earliest time possible,
set up diplomatic relations
with the new regime.
That's wonderful.
The frantic bombing of Shanghai
by the KMT is causing chaos.
l'm worried about Madam Sun's safety.
She's our most faithful friend
when we were in dire straits.
The new CPPCC is about to commence.
lt won't be complete without her.
Men like us
won't know how to talk to her.
Send a female comrade
to escort her here.
Enlai, we'll burden
Yingchao with the task.
Good idea.
Madam Zhou to escort Madam Sun.
l'll tell her right away.
To form a coalition
government without you
is something the Party
will never agree to.
Neither would the rest of the country.
l'm only the vanguard.
lf l failed to convince
you, Enlai would be next
and then Chairman Mao himself.
lf we all failed to convince you,
we'd put this on the
agenda of the CPPCC,
vote on it and send a delegation.
You Communists
won't stop until you get what you want.
What do you think of this house?
Not bad, spacious and bright.
Mayor Chen Yi said he'd giving it to you
as a permanent site for the youth center
of your China Welfare Fund.
The children can play in here every day.
That's wonderful.
Madam Sun.
Times have changed, Zedong.
You mustn't do that.
Only for Madam Sun.
Thanks for the invitation
and Yingchao's company.
Now the Party can work
with all delegates
to build a new state,
l must thank your help and support.
You have been a great help to
the country and its people
and a benefactor of our Party.
Fellow delegates,
the yellow flag pole in the center of
figure No. 1 represents the Yellow River.
lt stands out. Those in favor,
please raise your hands.
Good. lt's unilateral.
l object.
From an artistic perspective,
No. 32 is much better.
Mr. Tian is an artist
who's partial to the 5 stars.
The person who submitted this design
is an ordinary clerk from Shanghai.
lt was disqualified in the first round,
but l want to bring it up again.
Because this design
is full of emotions.
l object to the version of the 4
stars representing the 4 classes.
l prefer the Yellow River pattern.
Simple and sharp.
How many in favor of the 5-star flag?
Delegate Xu Beihong suggests
we use "March of the Volunteers''
as the national anthem.
Let's hear your comments.
The melody is good, but we
need to change the lyrics.
This is a new China.
The original lyrics are outdated.
Mr. Tian Han, you're the lyricist.
What's your opinion?
l should refrain from commenting.
l'll listen to the others.
l agree we should change the lyrics.
We can't sing it every day,
especially this line:
"As the Chinese nation faces
its greatest peril.''
lt won't work.
l disagree, "La Marseillaise'' of France
is tragic but has been
handed down till now.
That's France, not China.
The lyrics of the song remind us
not to forget the past. l agree.
New China needs a new
song for its new outlook.
Why use a song from an old movie?
What about you, Mr. Li?
"March of the Volunteers''
was written for the war.
l sang it before. lt's inspirational
and gets my blood boiling.
''Let our flesh and blood
become our new Great Wall''.
We must remember history.
No need to change the lyrics.
Well said.
Agree. l have a good
sense for danger too.
The Chairman wishes to
keep the original lyrics.
What about you? You
kept raising your hand.
They took the words out of
my mouth. l have no comment.
Let me say just one thing.
To be vigilant in peace time is
what a mature nation should do.
We'll let Mr. Tian Han decide.
Then let's keep the lyrics.
Chairman Mao, fellow delegates.
Are you ready?
Look over here, ready.
This is a women's delegation.
Chairman, everyone is talking about
the pattern on the national flag.
What do you think?
l like the Yellow River.
l disagree.
Can you fix the negative? Yes.
Take out the person next to me.
There are over 10 people next to you.
l mean the man who jammed in.
Alright. Thank you.
What's your reason?
Chairman, adding a pole to the middle
gives the impression of
splitting up the country.
ls that the right interpretation?
Can't be that serious. Most
people prefer this one.
Gong Peng, what do you think?
We like No. 32.
Placing five stars in the left corner
with four small stars surrounding
and their tips pointing at the
big star. lt looks pretty.
Chairman, the big star in the
middle represents the Party
while the small ones
represent the 4 classes.
The symbolism is correct.
Looking at this flag makes
one feel enthusiastic.
Enthusiastic?
l feel excited when l look at the flag.
Madam Sun likes this design too.
You have been abroad, your
opinion should count.
Please tell us what you think.
The five stars design is a good
representation of China's situation.
Under the leadership of the CPC,
all the classes are united
to build a new China.
The color is sharp, solemn and grand.
The truth is, China is united. Well said.
We're united now and we'll
always be in the future.
ls the air raid on Beiping feasible?
The Chairman wants feedback
from the Air Force.
The flying radius is too big.
The planes must re-tank somewhere
or they won't make it back.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has
liaised with the Americans in Korea.
You can rest assured.
But the CPC has its air force now.
The Chairman only wants to know
if the air raid is feasible. That's all.
Despite the difficulties, as
long as he issues the order,
we'll get it done.
Fellow delegates,
the CPPCC that the whole
country is looking forward to
will now commence.
The new CPPCC
will commence on a
brand new foundation.
lt represents the Chinese people
and has the people's faith and support.
Therefore, the CPPCC
hereby announces
its right to call this meeting.
Fellow delegates,
we have a consensus
that our work here
will go down in history.
lt proves that China, which accounts
for 1/4 of the world's population,
is finally on her feet.
The destiny of China is in
the hands of her people.
China will rise like the sun in the east.
lts radiance will illuminate the land
and cleanse the filth and mire left
behind by the reactionary government.
Heal the wounds of war
and build a brand new
and powerful People's Republic of China.
Long live the People's Republic of China.
Long live the Coalition Government.
Long live the unity of the people.
According to Commander Zhou,
the planes are in Class A status.
They're ready to bombard
Beiping any time.
But the US has turned down our
request to refuel in Pusan.
What does that mean?
They can't come back after takeoff.
What time is Mao's founding ceremony?
lt's fate. The KMT is
ruined with our own hands.
Cancel the mission.
Yes, sir.
The People's Republic of China and
the Central People's Government
have been established today.
