And so today
you are full-fledged ensigns.
Three short months ago,
you assembled here
from all parts of the nation,
and all walks of life. -
- Field, factory,
office, and college campuses.
Each of you knew what the fighting was about,
or you wouldn't have volunteered.
Each of you knew that the American way of
life must be defended, by life itself.
From here on,
your education must continue...
in the more demanding school
of actual war.
Wearing the gold stripe of ensign
in the United States Navy. -
- You go down to the sea to fight in
the toughest conflict of all time.
Your fellow Americans share
my confidence that...
you will serve the Navy and the Country
with honor and distinction.
Good luck
and good hunting.
Mother: Willie,
over here!
- Darling, I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks, Mother.
- Congratulations, Willie.
- Thanks, Uncle Loyd.
Your mother promised to
let me know if the Navy...
doesn't makes full use of your abilities.
With the proper approach, perhaps I could
help you be placed somewhere else.
- Good luck for now, in the meantime.
- Thank you.
Mother, I'm afraid I'm going to have to
skip your party tonight.
Some of the fellas are having
a little celebration.
But darling, the party's in your honor.
Besides, we have so few days left together.
Your friends will forgive you, I'm sure.
You can call them from the house.
" I never knew
what they could do "
" I can't believe that
you're in love with me "
" You're telling
everyone I know "
" I'm on your mind
each place you go "
" They can't believe that
you're in love with me "
" I have always placed you
far above me "
" I just can't image that
you love me "
" And after all is
said and done "
" To think that I'm
the lucky one "
" I can't believe that
you're in love with me "
May...
Darling,
you were wonderful.
Thanks.
I'm surprised your mother let you out.
I had to be with her.
I should have told you yesterday I couldn't
make it here tonight. I'm sorry.
- Order me a drink, then we'll fight.
- Leo, two Scotch and waters, please.
Darling, let's not spoil the night.
I've only got a couple of days left.
- I'm leaving Sunday.
- How do you expect me to feel?
Leaving me standing there
all alone.
Willie, why didn't you introduce me
to your mother?
I wanted you to met her.
But, there's a time for everything.
I'm sure.
To the most important woman in your life...
Mom.
- May, stop it.
- I'm sorry, Willie.
I didn't mean to ruin your big evening.
I guess, I just bruise easily.
Alright,
what do we do to celebrate?
We can go to the Fairmont, Top of the Mark,
anything you say...
Or we don't have to go to a club.
- Meaning what?
- Look darling, I've only got 48 hours.
- Willie, don't.
- May, I love you.
All right.
Will you marry me?
Look darling,
if there were more time...
I didn't expect you to.
I guess I forgot who I was. Just another
nightclub singer for a big weekend.
I don't want any more of it.
Not another minute.
- Good luck, Mr. Keith.
- Thanks, George.
Goodbye,
Mother.
Drop a cable the minute
you get to Pearl Harbor.
If I can.
I'm terribly worried.
Uncle Loyd tells me...
that ship you've been assigned too
has been in lots of battles.
Mother,
don't worry.
- Do you have enough spending money?
- More than enough.
You'd better take this extra $100, dear.
Mother,
please don't cry.
I can't help it.
You're all I have left.
Willie, promise me you'll be careful. Don't
volunteer or do anything foolish.
Mother,
I won't.
I won't. I promise.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
- Request permission to come on board.
- Permission granted.
- Request permission to come on board.
- Permission granted.
Sir.
the Caine's a real beauty.
The Caine is the inboard ship.
Crossing over.
- Very well.
- This way, Keith.
This way,
Keith.
Hey!
Watch that enthusiasm. Nobody ever felt
that way about the Caine before.
I'm sorry, sir.
I lost my footing.
Keith,
this is our communications officer Lt. Keefer.
- How do you do, sir.
- How about logging him in, Tom
Your orders,
Keith.
Those monstrous papers that transform
ex-civilians into men without minds.
- I hate to be the one that does this to you.
- Gangway, lady with a baby!
Meatball, Horrible,
pick up Mr. Keith's gear in the well boat.
Aye, aye, sir.
Oh Keith, this is our executive officer,
Steve Maryk.
- Glad to have you on board, Keith.
- Thank you, sir.
Steve's our fireball,
the guy who gets things done.
- There's one on every ship.
- Very funny.
Come on Keith,
let's meet the captain.
- Watch your feet, sir!
- Come on, Keith!
They're making a mistake
scraping this ship.
The only thing that's keeping the water out
is the rust.
What do you want?
He's here,
sir.
OK, bring him in.
In here,
Keith.
Captain DeVriess,
this is Ensign Keith.
Keith!
May I see your orders and qualifications jacket,
or are they a military secret?
I'm sorry,
sir.
Princeton,
'41...
Top five percent
in midshipman's school...
Pretty good background,
pretty good record.
Disappointed they assigned you
to a minesweeper, Keith?
Well, sir... to be honest.
Yes, sir.
You saw yourself on a carrier,
or a battleship, no doubt?
Yes sir,
I had hoped that...
Well, I only hope that
you're good enough for the Caine.
I'll try to be worthy of this assignment,
sir.
She's not a battleship or a carrier,
the Caine is a beaten-up tub.
After 18 months of combat, it takes 24 hrs
a day just to keep her in one piece.
I understand,
sir.
I don't think
you do.
But whether you like it or not, Keith,
you're in the junkyard navy.
Steve, put in with Keefer
in Communications.
And tell Tom when he's free,
to show this Princeton Tiger
and our other new ensign
around the ship.
Yes, sir.
And Keith...
Don't take it so hard.
War is hell.
- Ensign Keith, Ensign Harding.
- My condolences.
- Thanks.
-Alright, my Junior League\citizens...
Let's get with it.
The USS Caine is a minesweeper.
These paravanes
used for minesweeping.
They carry sweep wires
off both sides of the ship.
The wire contacts the mooring cable of a mine
and saws it in two.
We've been in combat a year and a half,
and during that time ...
we've never been asked to
swept one single mine.
So, the first thing you've got to learn
about this ship is that ...
she was designed by geniuses
to be run by idiots.
This is the engine room.
To operate, all you need is any group
of well trained monkeys.
is strict routine,
only one percent requires creative intelligence.
That about does it.
Any more questions?
Yes, sir.
Where do we go to surrender?
It's not that easy.
- Sir, you don't like the Navy, do you?
- Who called the Caine ?
Well gentlemen, just one more thing to do.
Climb the mast.
What for?
A mast is a mast.
When the Captain orders a tour,
he means from the keel to the foretop.
That's the foretop.
I have a wife and a kid, I'm very fond of them.
I'll probably never see them again.
Well done!
- I'm glad he liked it.
- Yeah.
Keith, I regret to tell you, I'm gonna be sick.
I'm sorry.
Height bothers me.
Those poor sailors down there.
I could use my hat,
but it's the only one I've got.
I have two others.
- That's darn cordial of you.
- Perfectly, welcome.
Hey, what's keeping you guys up there?
Lunch!
Lunch!?
Oh!
- Excuse me, sir.
- It's all right.
Tell me Keith, now that you've had
a chance to study the Caine...
more closely,
do you like her better?
- The tour was very interesting, sir.
- Is the ship too messy for you?
- That is a difficult question, sir.
- It's a ridicules question.
The question is,
Very decent of you to join us for lunch, Tom.
I didn't think you could spare the time.
Well, my novel will suffer, but even the
greatest of literary artists gets hungry.
Pull up a chair, Tom, and
cast some pearls before the swine.
- Or whatever it is you say you do.
- I will.
Somebody has to protect these fresh eager
young faces from the captain's badgering.
I'm not badgering anyone, Tom. I'm just
conducting a one-man board of inquiry.
I'm trying to find out if
Ensign Keith wants to stay on board.
There is no escape from the Caine, save death.
We are all doing penance.
Sentenced to an outcast ship,
manned by outcasts,
and named after the greatest outcast
of them all.
- Here we go again.
- I'm merely stating absolute fact.
He's right, Steve...
I've been sweating out myself,
waiting for two years to be...
relieved of command,
and there is no sign of it yet.
But then...
I don't have Ensign Keith's influence.
Sir,
I don't understand.
I received this dispatch from
Admiral Wards about an hour ago.
"With your approval, I will request transfer
to my staff for Ensign Willis Steward Keith."
"Understand of course
needs of USS Caine have priority."
- Sir, I didn't know anything about this request.
- Could be coincidence.
Or someone pulling strings.
What'll it be,
Keith?
The admiral's staff or as Tom puts it:
Well, I don't know,
sir.
It's a simple choice.
Do you want to fight a war?
Captain,
this is hardly a place for a decision.
Oh nonsense, Steve. A good officer should be
able to make up his mind anywhere.
- Well, come on, Keith. We haven't got all day.
- Well, sir...
- I'll stay on board, sir.
- That takes care of that.
Ah Willie,
you will live to regret this day.
Sir, I spotted a lot of Japanese aircraft
off the starboard bow. Position, Angle 20.
Angle 20.
You see them,
Captain?
If the war last ten years Keith, you may learn
to tell the difference between aircraft and seagulls.
"Man all stations for minesweeping drill.
Man all stations for minesweeping drill."
Launch sweep gear.
Port paravanes in the water.
"Steve, that was the lousiest performance
I've ever seen.
Stand by to stream starboard side.
Retrieve sweep gear.
"C'mon Steve, snap it up.
The Jones is beating us in."
Look out!
Stop the engines.
Get me a line.
You're not going to swim for it,
the water's full of sharks.
- Stand by the line.
- Yes, sir.
Mr. Keith, this action dispatch just arrived.
Mr. Keefer said you had the code duty.
I'll take care of it
right away.
OK!
Haul away!
Lead the line
outboard of everything.
Report
The Jones never saw the day
they could beat us.
You pooped out, Steve! We streamed three
minutes quicker at Guadalcanal.
You must love that guy
to do what you did for him.
Go dry yourself,
Keith.
- Is that you, Willie?
- Yeah.
Hey Willie,
didn't you say you went to Princeton?
I didn't say.
Well, maybe one of these days I'll let you read
a couple of chapters of my novel.
- A Princeton man's opinion might be valuable.
- Thanks.
- Horrible!
- Yes, sir?
Pick up those orange peels.
This isn't a hunting barge.
Yes, sir
Alright Meatball, laugh once more
and you're in trouble.
Over intercom: "Ensign Keith, report to
the Captain's cabin.
"On the double,
on the double!"
Oh these 90-day wonders...
Everyone one of them thinks
they're five-star admiral.
Yeah.
- Come in.
- Yes, sir?
Keiths, three days ago, this ship received a
dispatch addressed to us for action.
- Smitty here, says he gave it to you.
Is that correct?
Yes, sir. I forgot about it.
It's still in the pocket of my dirty khaki.
- Did you decode the message?
- No, sir.
It's incredible stupidity
and carelessness on my part...
Fortunately,
I had the job done for you.
- That'll be all, Smitty.
- Yes, sir.
Keith...
Have you any idea how serious misplacing
an action dispatch can be?
Yes, sir.
I don't think you have.
Because of you, this ship might have failed
to carry out a combat assignment.
I hope you realize that
for such a failure,
I would bear the full responsibility
in a court martial.
I understand,
sir.
I've been filling out officer's fitness
reports this morning, Keith.
- How you think this ought to affect yours?
- Anyone can make a mistake, sir.
There are mistakes
and mistakes.
The margin for error
is narrow in the Navy, Keith.
There's too much loss of life and property
damage possible in every act.
Here.
Read it.
"Ensign Keith seems
a fairly bright young man."
"He may become a competent officer
once he overcomes...
...the light and careless approach
to his duties."
- Do you consider that fair?
- Sir, if I may be permitted...
Go ahead,
Keith.
I made a mistake, but I don't see why
I should be singled out for it.
Everyones goofed off
around here.
The Caine's a slack ship.
The men act like a pack of cut throats,
and the decks look like a Singapore junk.
I take it than, you must also
strongly disapprove of me.
- Go ahead Keith, man to man.
- Sir, I'm in no position to approve or disapprove.
I only know my conception of a captain
seems different from your own.
I'll take it under advisement.
Since you feel so bitter. -
- Perhaps what's in the dispatch
will brighten your day.
As you can see Keith,
I'm being relieved of command.
Next week, this time,
you'll have yourself a new captain.
Lieutenant Commander
Philip Francis Queeg. Feel better?
- Definitely, sir.
- Good. That'll be all, Keith.
"In accordance with
Bureau of Naval Personnel. -
"Order 016021 of
November 1943.
"You'll report to the commanding officer
of the USS Caine...
"for duty on board
and relief of his command.
"Signed, Louis Whitfield,
Rear Admiral, USN, Chief of Bureau."
I relieve you,
sir.
All standing orders to remain in force
until further notice.
Dismiss the men to quarters.
- Good luck, Captain.
- Thank you.
Crew dismissed.
Oh... ah Captain,
if you would like me too,
I'll stay aboard for a couple of days
till you get used to the feel of things.
No thanks. There's no need for that. We all
have our own ways of running a ship.
Sure.
This one's tired.
She's had the guts run out of her.
She ought to be melted down
for razor blades.
The crew may not look like much,
they're tired, too. Every man is okay.
- I understand.
- I hope you do.
Yours, Captain.
Attention on deck.
- Request permission to leave to leave the ship.
- Permission, granted, sir.
Captain,
sir?
- What is it, Meatball?
- Nothing, sir.
Well, a few of the guys chipped in and...
Whose idea was this?
Well, I won't accept it.
It's against Navy regulations.
- Well, that's what I told them, sir
- You don't always go by regulations, Captain.
That's my trouble.
I've been aboard the Caine too long.
Now you men take an even strain
with the new skipper,
and everything
will be all right.
- I'm leaving the ship, sir.
- Yes, sir.
What do you know? Somebody
left his watch lying around.
I might as well have a souvenir of this old bucket.
Not a bad-looking watch at that.
- What time is it, Mr. Keith?
- 11:00, sir.
Make it 10:30.
I'll always keep it a half hour slow -
- To remind me
of the fouled-up crew of the Caine.
Carry on.
What's everybody
so choked up for?
No matter what everyone says, Willie, I still think
that someday you'll make an officer.
Captain Queeg requests a meeting of all
officers at in the wardroom 13:00.
Well gentlemen,
we'll gonna be shipmates for a long time.
I though we ought
to get acquainted.
I've formed some pretty good impressions.
You're probably curious about me.
Well, my background is simple enough.
Just another naval officer.
I've had seven tough years
in the Atlantic.
Believe-you-me,
they made the last two mighty interesting.
The way those subs ganged up on us,
I thought they had it in for me personally.
Now,
to get down to cases.
Anyone who knows me,
will tell you I'm a book man.
I believe everything in it was put
in for a purpose.
When in doubt, remember on board this ship,
we do things by the book.
Deviate from the book, and you've better
have a half a dozen good reasons,
and you'll still will get
an argument from me.
And I don't lose arguments
on board my ship.
That's one of the nice things
about being captain.
Now I want you to remember
one thing,
on board my ship
excellent performance is standard. -
standard performance
is sub-standard,
and sub-standard performance is not
permitted to exist. That, I warn you.
OK?
Now that I've shot my face off,
I'll give anyone who wants too,
the chance to do the same thing.
Captain,
I don't want to seem out of line,
but it's been a long time since
this crew did things by the book.
Mr. Maryk,
you may tell the crew for me...
there are four ways
of doing things on board my ship:
The right way, the wrong way,
the Navy way, and my way.
- They do things my way, and we'll get along.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Okay?
Anyone else?
Come in.
Beg pardon, Captain. Sorry to interrupt.
Official message from ComServ Pac.
Thank you.
One moment,
messenger.
What's your name
and rate?
Urban, sir.
Seaman First, Signalman Striker.
- Very well. You may go.
- Yes, sir.
Gentlemen,
did anyone notice anything peculiar...
about Seaman First Class Urban?
A shirt-tail hanging outside trousers
is the regulation uniform,
I believe,
for bus boys...
not however,
for a sailor in the US Navy.
These are the things we are going
to start noticing again.
- Maryk, who's the Morale Officer?
- There is no Moral Officer, sir.
- Who's the Junior Ensign?
- Keith, sir.
Mr. Keith?
Sir?
You are now the Morale Officer.
In addition to your other duties,
you will now see to it that every man keeps
his shirt-tail tucked inside his trousers.
Aye aye, sir.
OK...
If I see another shirt-tail flapping while
I'm Captain of this ship...
Woe betide the sailor,
woe betide the OOD,
and woe betide the Morale Officer.
I kid you not.
Now...
according to this dispatch,
we are to proceed to Area X-ray...
at 08:00 tomorrow
to tow targets.
I'm going to give it to you simply.
The Caine is going to be the best
target-towing ship in this man's navy.
That'll be all,
gentlemen.
Mr. Keith, I want all the men to have their hair
cut to regulation length,
and their faces clean shaven
by 24:00.
Aye, aye, sir.
Well,
he's certainly Navy.
Yeah,
so was Captain Bligh.
Intercom: "Attention all hands.
Attention all hands.
" Ships will commence firing
at target at 10:00.
" All Observers lay out
to the fantail. "
Flash.
Short. 200. Over.
Hit. Over.
Short. 100.
Over. 150. 200.
Intercom: " Ensign Keith, report to the bridge,
on the double. On the double. "
Yes, sir!
Keith, do you have any explanation
for the appearance of this sailor?
- Corporal, you heard my order on shirt-tails.
- Sir, I've got a heat rash...
Well,  tuck your shirt in,
now.
Sir,
the captain won't let me.
Of course not. I want you to see the
rotten job you're doing, Mr...
- Gwendolyn, Gwendolyn, this is Tarzan.
- Tarzan, this is Gwendolyn.
Cease present exercises
and return to base. Well done. Out.
Roger.
Thank you, sir.
We're heading back.
Right standard rudder.
And now,
Mr. Keith...
First of all, do you or don't you have
an explanation for this?
Sir, I was on the fantail-
I didn't ask for an alibi. Evidently,
my orders must mean very little to you.
Sir, I'm completely at fault,
but I tried my best.
Your  Mr. Keith,
is only a maximum of inefficiency.
Hey, what's the matter with the old man?
We're steaming in a circle.
Yeah,
I know.
- Captain...
- Will you not interrupt while I'm speaking?
Captain,
we're going around in cir...
One more word out of you,
and you're on report.
Aye, aye, sir.
And you, Mr. Keefer, can you explain why the
first violation...
occurred while you were
officer of the deck?
There are limits to what a man can do
when he has the deck.
Mr. Keefer, the officer of the deck is
as equally as responsible his duties...
as I am for the welfare
of this ship.
And one thing more, mister.
War is a 24-hour job.
There will be no more
on the Caine.
Mr. Keith, Mr. Keefer, you will both
submit written reports explaining:
A. Why this man had
his shirt-tail out.
B. Why you failed so miserably
to carry my orders out.
Keefer:
Aye, aye, sir.
Meatball, look! I'm I seeing straight or
are we cutting back across our tow?
It's impossible.
But it's happened!
We're gonna cut our own tow line.
You'd better tell him again.
Not, me.
What's happening?
What's going on?
What's our target
doing out there?
What blazes were you two doing?
Sir, you told me to keep
right standard rudder. I was just...
You idiot.
All engines stop.
Captain, we've steamed
over our tow line.
Who said we steamed over the tow line?
Who said that?
We've cut the target adrift.
We did nothing of the kind. Something
must have been wrong with the cable.
We can hardly be held responsible
if we're given faulty cable...
that breaks the minute
the ship turns a few degrees.
Sir, should we recover the target?
It shouldn't take more than half an hour.
Half an hour? That means we'll be the last ship
back in Pearl Harbor. No thank you.
We're not going to have to answer
a lot of questions...
about something that's
not our fault.
- Reel in the cable.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Mr. Keefer, send the following dispatch.
ComServ Pac:
"Defective tow line parted,
south-west corner, x-ray."
"Target adrift.
Menace to navigation."
"Suggest tug,
recover or destroy."
He'll never get away with it.
Now, let's head for the barn.
Aye, aye, sir.
All engines ahead full.
All engines ahead full,
sir.
Queeg: Willie?
- Sir?
You look worried?
I know a man's shirt is a petty detail, but
big things are made up of details.
Don't forget...
For want of a nail, a horseshoe
was lost, and then the whole battle.
A captain's job is a lonely one.
He's easily misunderstood.
Forget that I bawled you out. It was good
for the morale of all concerned.
OK?
Yes, sir.
Keefer:
Hallelujah!
Look what just came in.
We're going back to San Francisco.
San Francisco?
You're kidding.
All thanks to our beloved Captain Queeg.
He's in plenty of hot water.
I told you the Navy would never accept his
double talk about the towing line.
They can't be sending us all the way back
just for that?
Listen to this: "Upon arrival,
Commanding Officer USS Caine...
"report immediately
Commander Western Sea Frontier."
I tell you Willie,
he's in serious trouble.
Our Captain is about
to be boiled in oil.
And you, you lucky fellow,
are about to see your girl.
Willie!
- Willie, darling.
- Mother.
This is a real surprise.
Well, you didn't expect me not to be here,
did you?
Oh, it's wonderful to have
my boy close again.
Mother... I'd like you
to meet a friend of mine. May Wynn.
I'm always delighted
to meet one of Willie's friends.
Thank you.
Hello, Oh! Hello, May?
Sure! I'll be right down then. Okay.
Well, I guess I'm ready to go, mother.
I'm afraid I'm going to miss you all.
It's just a weekend at Yosemite.
- A sailor needs some play time.
- Miss Wynn's going with you?
Yes,
she is.
- You must feel strongly about her.
- I do, mother. I like her a lot.
- You have a nice weekend yourself.
- Are you in love with her, Willie?
I don't know. But I sure missed her
every minute I was away.
Well, she is attractive, but you
don't know anything about her.
You haven't even
met her parents.
That's right. I guess I'll have
to do that someday.
Wille, for your own sake,
all I want you to do is...
well, promise you won't
do anything rash.
- I promise.
- You mean it, Willie?
Sure,
I mean it.
Goodbye,
Mom.
Easy, May.
That's good.
Well,
how did you like it?
It's like breaking in a new song.
Fun but scary.
You know, it was nice of your mother
to let you come to Yosemite like this.
- It wasn't up to my mother.
- Well...
- It looks like the war has made a difference.
- Has it?
I missed you more than
I planned to.
Announcer:
- May: This is paradise.
- Willie: Isn't it.
- Willie, there are people.
- Let them look.
You have changed. Sometimes I think
there's almost a chance for us.
- Willie, it's getting late.
- It's getting very late.
I'll wait,
thanks.
Good morning, darling.
Sorry I'm late.
I guess I'm not used to being
without an alarm clock.
- What a day. Have you ordered yet?
- Not yet.
- Just some orange juice and coffee, please.
- Make it two.
Do you know what I would like to do?
I'd love to take a long walk.
Climb to the top of that mountain
over there.
- Darling, what's the matter?
- Just thinking.
Well, come on now, somethings the matter.
I expected you to be happy...
May, what would you think about spending
the rest of your life with a monster like me?
- What's this?
- I'm talking about our getting married.
Is that what
you really want?
Of course I want it.
Don't look at me as if I'm a crazy.
I don't want you to marrying me because
you feel sorry for me.
Because you think it's the
decent thing to do.
Look, May...
I love you and I want to marry you.
Yes or no?
No.
Why not?
Because your mother won't approve.
I think that's whats bothering you.
Of course she'll approve.
She won't approve, but you'll marry me anyway
and you'll be so unhappy.
I won't be unhappy.
I love you.
Maybe you do...
really do.
But marriage has to be by your own approval.
No one else's.
That's asking a lot,
May.
That's right.
Have a good cry, Willie.
I know I will.
Well brother, in another 30 seconds
you'd have been AWOL.
I just got the telegram.
And you just couldn't tear yourself away
from your girl?
Yeah.
Any news on Queeg?
Queeg: "Tangle up all lines
and stand by to cast off.
"Hope you haven't been inconvenienced any,
Mr. Keith. "
Looks like you made a slight mistake, Tom.
He's still here.
My mistake was nothing
compared to the Navy's.
Take in the bow.
Well gentlemen,
as you probably know by now,
we returned to San Francisco
for a new radar installation.
However, certain misleading reports on things
that happened at Pearl Harbor...
were sent to
the Force Commander.
This created doubts in his mind
about the Caine's competence...
to be returned
to combat.
I made it clear to him that I inherited a ship
in a low state of training...
and I could hardly be expected to pull it
into shape overnight, he agreed.
So from now on, gentlemen,
there will not be further mistakes...
on the part of the officers
and crew of this ship.
Sorry sir,
some smoke went down the wrong way.
This,
is an important command.
The Navy's is probably waiting for me
to make a butch,
Well I'm not going to make it and I'm not going
to permit anybody to make it for me.
So much for old business.
Gentlemen,
I've have good news for you.
We're on our way to
the greatest invasion attempted in this war.
I kid you not. The greatest.
So let's all straighten up and fly right.
All hands, put on battle dress.
"All hands, put on battle dress
and anti-flash cream."
We don't have to shot the Japs.
We can scare them to death.
Cease fire, cease fire.
Keith:
Close the boat group and take stations.
Mr. Keith, you take the com.
Aye, aye, sir.
That's the group we're suppose to take in.
Jacob Group Four.
Correct course, 045.
aye, aye.
All engines, ahead full.
We're closing too fast.
We're gonna run those boats down.
Where's the captain?
He's on the wing.
On the wing? How can he left you handle
the ship at a time like this?
All engines stop.
-
Boats ahoy!
Boats ahoy!
What's going on?
Who's yelling at whom, here?
Sorry, sir. It looked like we were overshooting
these boys, so I stopped.
Well, let's get it over with.
What's the distance to the beach?
About three miles, sir.
We're suppose to take...
I just want to know the yardage,
OK?
Steve, you take the com, get us there.
Full speed ahead.
We will proceed.
Follow us. Good luck.
OK,
thanks.
Left tangent: 006.
- Beacon: 084.
- Distance: 5,000.
We're pulling too far ahead of the attack group.
All engines back one third.
Left tangent: 350.
- Beacon: 116.
- Distance: 4,000.
Why are we slowing down?
Sir, we we're losing them.
If they can't keep up with us, throw over
a dye marker when we reach the spot.
Hey, we're getting too close.
You want to run us on the beach?
Sir, we still have at least 1,500 yards
to go with the boats.
You're crazy.
I can read instruments
as well as anybody on this ship.
We're within 1,000 yards
of the beach right now.
This is as far as we're
suppose to take them.
- Left full rudder.
-
- All engines ahead full.
-
- Throw over a dye marker.
- But, Captain...
You heard me,
throw over a dye marker.
Fantail from the bridge,
throw over a dye marker.
Sir, we can't leave
those marines...
Mr. Maryk, I'm taking the com,
I'm relieving you.
Aye, aye, sir.
- What's he doing? Running away?
- Don't look for trouble, Tom.
Well...
What do you think of
your boy now?
I don't know.
- There must be a reason for what he did.
- Yeah. There's a reason, all right.
"I've got those yellow stain blues
those silly yellow stain blues
"when someone fires a shot
it's always there I am not
"I've got those yellow stain blues
the old yellow stain blues
- We'd better pipe down.
- Don't be so worried, Willie.
You know, it's about time you
got over being impressed
by people in authority like parents
and ship captains.
- Thanks, Dad.
- You're welcome.
Shhh...
more, more.
"I've got those yellow stain blues
down from my head to my shoes
"you should see strong men quail
if he should spy a shirt-tail..."
- OK Buddy, cut it.
- Oh Steve, I thought you'd be amused.
This is magnificent saga of a man who's lack of
charm...
is only exceeded by his
lack of intestinal fortitude.
It's not funny Tom,
and you ought to know better.
Find somebody else to sing about.
That's an order.
Why,
ought to be flattered.
I don't want to hear the name
again.
Yes, sir.
The captain wants a meeting
in the wardroom, immediately.
And he kids us not.
Now, don't get up gentlemen, please.
I'm not too feeling well.
What I have to say
won't take long.
That'll be all,
steward.
I know that some of you are perhaps
a little afraid of me.
I'm not that terrible.
I have a wife and a child and a dog.
They're rather fond of me. Even
the dog doesn't think I'm a monster.
Perhaps certain things
happened today.
Well, as I always say,
a command is a lonely job.
It isn't easy to make decisions.
Sometimes the captain of a ship
needs help...
by help I mean...
constructive loyalty.
What I'm trying to say is,
a ship is like a family.
We all have our ideas
of right and wrong. -
- But we have to pitch in
for the good of the family.
If there was only some way
we could help each other.
I, ah...
If there is anything, any of you would like to say,
I.. I mean, I'll be glad to listen.
Well, I've spoken my piece.
I only hope it registers.
Don't get up,
please.
Painter, have the pharmacist mate
send up some more aspirin.
My headache's much worse.
Yes, sir.
This is what is known
in literature as the
Well, there's only one thing left to do,
write to Walter Winchell.
- He almost made me feel sorry for him.
- Don't be so sentimental, Willie.
I thought it was a
pretty good speech.
It wasn't exactly an apology, but it was
as close as he could get to one.
We could have
backed him up.
What could we have said? He turned yellow
the first time we got into action.
Look Princeton, you know from nothing
about DeVriess...
and you know even less
about Queeg.
He's a tired man .
His nerves are shot.
It's happened before that a man loses his
head after what Queeg has gone through.
That's an endearing explanation,
but it won't hold.
Has the thought ever occurred to you that
our captain might be unbalanced?
I'm no psychiatrist, but I know something
about abnormal behavior.
Captain Queeg has every symptom of
acute paranoia.
It's just a question of time before
he goes over the line.
- Step outside, Keith.
- I'd like to stay, sir.
- Let him. He studied psychology at college.
- You're fooling with dynamite, Tom.
Will you look at the man?
He's a Freudian delight.
He crawls with clues.
His fixation on the little rolling balls.
The chattering in second-hand phrases
and slogans.
His inability to look you in the eye.
The constant migraine headaches...
Shirt-tails, and tonight's pathetic speech:
"Forget about my turning yellow,
my dog likes me."
- I think Tom does make sense.
- You stay out of it.
Alright...
so he has migraine headaches
and he rolls steel balls.
And he does a lot of other screwy things,
so what?
You used to get up before reveille,
and fill a lot of paper with scribbling.
Everybody's a screwball in some way.
That doesn't make them crazy.
You're kidding yourself,
Steve.
Alright, will you go over to
the fleet medical officer with me,
and repeat everything
you've told me?
Do you agree with my diagnosis
of Queeg?
Not with a word of it, even if I understood
what you were talking about.
Well then, why should you expect me to take
the whole thing on my shoulders?
You are his executive officer, if you don't see it,
I wouldn't stand a chance.
OK then,
we drop it right now.
There'll be no more talk about
the captain being crazy.
It's like running around explosives
with a blow torch.
I still insist he's
a paranoia case
See this bible?
I swear to you on this,
I'll report to the captain anything further
you say along those lines.
There's no more friendship on this point.
That's the straight dope.
"Medical log
on Lieutenant Commander X-ray.
"This log is being started because
the possibility appears to exist -
"- that the commander of this ship
may be mentally disturbed."
"March 5, 1944. This evening,
as usual,
we were showing a Hopalong Cassidy
movie on the foresail ... "
Stop the picture!
Will you please stop this picture!
Attention on deck!
May I ask, why I wasn't notified that
this movie was being shown?
Sir, last week you told me you
couldn't look at another Western.
So I just assumed...
You assumed! This was calculated disrespect
to your commanding officer.
All right. There will be
no more movies for 30 days.
"May 28, 1944. Morale couldn't be lower.
The crew is resentful.
"The officers are just going through
the motions of carrying out orders.
"This afternoon, the captain decided
to hold a general drill...
"for the instruction
and safety of the crew..."
This is the captain speaking.
A great many men have ignored
my orders about wearing battle gear.
So there is only one way
to drive the point home.
Every man not wearing a helmet or lifejacket
will be docked 3 days liberty.
I see you! Now I want that knocked that off!
Stop putting on that gear!
- Mr. Keith.
- Sir?
Put that man down there without
a lifejacket on report.
Which one,
sir?
That one down there,
on number one machine gun!
You people think you're very clever.
Well, you're not fooling me!
Get that red-headed fellow over there.
That one there!
Sir, it's impossible to tell
which one's red-headed.
- They're all wearing their helmets.
- Keith, you're an idiot!
This is the captain speaking.
Some misguided sailors on this ship still think
they can pull a fast one on me.
Well, they're very
much mistaken.
Since you've taken this course,  the innocent
will be punished with the guilty.
There will be no liberty for any member
of this crew, for three months.
I will not be made a fool of.
Do you hear me?
"July 30, 1944. Today we received
a gift from officers of the USS Pinkney.
"I was checking the watch at 1:00 in the
morning when I spoke to Ensign Keith..."
How's it going?
Situation quiet, the captain's been put away
for the night.
Lay off.
Steve, you know that I was with you,
and against Tom at the beginning.
But I don't see how the Caine can go on
like this much longer. No ship can.
You haven't the experience to know,
one way or the other.
- I'm not blind. I've watched the men.
- All right, all right.
The captain's in rocky shape, but he'll
come out of it. He's got too.
Mr. Maryk, Mr. Keith, the captain wants
a meeting of all officers right away.
- Now, at 01:00 in the morning?
- Yes, sir.
Do you know what's it about?
Yes, sir,
Strawberries.
Are you sure this
is a gallon can?
Yes, sir. It's a lard can.
Just took it from the pantry, sir.
I suppose you're wondering
why I called this meeting.
As you all know by now, we had an
excellent dessert for dinner tonight,
ice cream and frozen strawberries.
Well, about an hour ago, I sent Whitaker
to the pantry to bring me another portion.
He came back with the ice cream
all right.
But he said:
Now gentlemen, I do not believe that
the officers of this ship consumed...
a full gallon of strawberries at dinner tonight.
And I intent to prove it.
Mr. Maryk, how many portions of ice cream
and strawberries did you have?
- Two, sir.
- Whitaker...
dole out a scoop of sand
for each portion of strawberry.
Yes, sir.
- Mr. Keefer, how many for you?
- Three, Captain.
- Keith?
- Two, sir.
- Harding?
- Two, sir.
- Painter?
- Two, sir.
- Comedy?
- Two, sir.
- Jorgensen...?
- Two, sir.
-Laughlin?
-Two, sir.
And the steward's mates had three.
Right, Whitaker?
Yes sir,
one helping each, sir.
- Mr. Keith said it was okay.
- Yes, I did, sir.
And I had four.
Twenty-four portions in all.
Now gentlemen, this tureen holds
an amount of sand that is equal...
to the amount of strawberries we had
at dinner tonight. Right, Whitaker?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Maryk, take a look at this gallon can
and tell me how much sand is left.
Maybe a quart,
or a little less.
OK...
have any of you gentlemen an explanation for
the quart of missing strawberries?
There can be no doubt that someone else
finished them for us.
As of now gentlemen, you are all appointed
to a board of investigation...
to find out who's responsible
for this theft.
- Mr. Maryk, you are the senior member.
- Do you mean in the morning, sir?
Now Mr. Maryk, according to my watch,
does not mean in the morning,
it means 01:47.
I expect a full report by 08:00.
Alright, alright, pipe down.
The faster we get  this done,
the faster we can get some sleep.
Send in the stewards one at a time
for questioning.
Yes, sir.
If only the strawberries had been poisoned,
all our problems would have been solved.
Strawberries,
anyone?
- Unsatisfactory.
- Sorry, Captain.
We kept the mess boys and the cook
most of the night.
They may be lying,
but it's a dead end.
We couldn't keep covering the
same ground endlessly, sir.
Gentlemen, you spent the entire night
and accomplished nothing.
While I thought the whole thing out
very clearly.
Did it ever occur to you that some bright boy...
might have made a duplicate key
to the wardroom icebox?
Sir, there's no indication...
There are some things we must assume,
Mr. Maryk, in order to be a good officer.
Now back in '37, when I was
a lowly ensign on a cruiser,
five pounds of cheese
was missing.
Everybody was willing to forget about it,
but not me.
I snooped around
and found some chow hound...
had made a wax impression
of the icebox key.
I made him confess and I got myself
a nice letter of commendation.
This looks to me like exactly
the same situation.
- But sir, we can't be sure there's a dupli...
- You've tired every other solution, haven't you?
Now I've worked out a very simple plan.
First, we collect every key on this ship
and tag it with the name of the owner.
Second, we strip all hands to make
sure we've got all the keys.
Third, we test each key
on the icebox padlock.
And the one that fits
will give us the name of the owner.
But Captain,
how do we know there is such a key?
I say there's a key.
Captain, what's to prevent this bright boy
from tossing the key overboard?
No, no, no, he would never toss
it overboard...
after he had gone to all the trouble
of making it.
He may try to hide it,
but we'll find it.
I ah...
never thought of that, sir.
Don't stand there,
get on the ball.
We ought to have little fun
for a change,
now that we have some
detective work to do.
Yes, sir.
Steve, turn me in if you want to.
But this is it. This is over the line.
Queeg is a paranoia or
there's no such thing as paranoia.
-Tom, I warned you.
- Yes. Can't you see what he's doing?
He's re-enacting his big triumph of his career,
He still wants to prove he is the red hot
Ensign Queeg of 1937. There is no key.
Well,
what happened to the strawberries?
Does it matter?
Is it worth turning a ship upside down?
Would anyone
but a crazy man do it?
Steve, are you familiar with
Article 184 of Navy regulations?
Vaguely.
Listen to this.
On the Caine
it's required reading.
Article 184:
"It is conceivable that most unusual and
extraordinary circumstances may arise
"In which the relief from duty of
a commanding officer...
"Either by placing him under arrest
or on the sick list.
"Such actions shall never be taken without the
approval of the Navy Department...
"except when it is impracticable because
of the delay involved."
If I were you, Steve,
I'd memorize it.
I'll take these
to the captain.
- Great weather for stripping down.
- Yeah, great for pneumonia.
That wouldn't stop
the investigation.
- Next.
- Alright, Meatball, you can get dressed.
Why... Mr. Keith, don't you want to x-ray me
for the key? Just to make sure?
I've seen him, Mr. Keith, he swallowed the key
with his coffee. Very tricky.
Pipe down you guys,
both of you.
So long, fellas.
Well, don't tell me you're
escaping from the Caine.
I got dispatch orders back to the states.
My wife is seriously ill.
I'm sorry to hear that.
- She'll be all right, Harding.
- Thanks.
We'll keep you posted on the outcome
of the great key investigation.
Yeah,
do that.
- Good luck, Harding.
- Thank you, sir.
Look fellas, if I tell you something, will you
promise not to do anything about it?
At least for now,
until I'm ashore?
- OK, what is it?
- There is no key.
- What?
- How do you know?
I know, the mess boys ate the strawberries.
I saw them.
I kept my mouth shut because I
didn't want to get them in trouble.
Then I made
my mistake,
I told the captain.
He called me a lair, and threatened to
hold up my orders ...
if I mentioned a word to anyone.
- So please don't say anything.
- You can count on us.
Boy, I'm happy to get out of this madhouse.
Well, so long and good luck.
I'll call all your wives and girls
for you.
Well...
Tom, I've been thinking about
what you've were saying.
I've been thinking about Article 184,
and I've got to admit you're right.
Admiral Halsey is here
with the fleet.
How about going over to see him after
we finish with this nonsense.
- Sure.
- You too, Willie.
Request permission to come on board, sir.
Admiral Halsey's quarters.
- Official business from the Caine.
- Very well.
- Lt. Jones.
- Yes sir.
These gentlemen
would like to see the admiral.
Very well.
Come along with me.
Just a minute please,
gentlemen.
Steve, this is a fine time to think of this,
but... we're making a big mistake.
- What are you talking about?
- Well, look at this.
We've been
kidding ourselves.
This isn't the Caine. This is the real navy,
with real officers, not Queegs.
- The Caine's a freak, a floating mistake.
- What are you driving at?
They'll never believe our story.
I don't get it.
Is the captain off his head or isn't he?
Is this record I've kept,
correct or not?
Yes, it's correct. The trouble is that
we won't be able to make it stick.
Unfortunately, everything Queeg did,
everything you've got in your log there,
can be interpreted
as an attempt to enforce discipline.
Yes,
but we know different.
Yeah, because we've lived through it,
Halsey hasn't.
Why didn't you tell me
this before?
Just be glad I've
thought of it now.
Believe me, Steve, if go through with this,
we're in trouble.
It won't mean as much to our boy here
and me, as it will to you,
you want to
stay in the Navy.
This can smash your whole career.
Do you want them to think
you're a mutinous officer?
Tom has an argument there.
Yes, but I'm willing to take a chance.
Are you scared?
Scared? I can see six sides to every risk and
Cut the kidding,
Tom.
Look fellas, behind this smiling
eloquent brilliant exterior,
I've got a yellow streak
- I'm too smart to be brave.
- Admiral Halsey will see you now.
I pass.
Thanks anyway. Thank the admiral.
We've decided this isn't the time.
Intercom:
" Make all preparations for heavy
weather. Dismissed from quarters. "
- Steve, what do we do now?
- Without Tom, I couldn't get to first base.
I never even heard the word
before he pulled it on me.
He's got to make the pitch,
or we're sunk.
I just don't get it.
Tom's certainly not a coward.
To tell you the truth Willie,
I don't know what Tom is... now.
You better double-time it
back to your ship.
We received a storm warning
and the fleet's getting underway.
- Turn on the standard lights.
- Aye, aye, sir
Sir, the barometer's still dropping.
Captain, the barometer is still dropping!
- I've seen it.
Captain, the Chief Engineer wants to know
if you gonna take on ballast?
No.
Tell him no.
Captain, I suggest that we do,
sir.
I'm not gonna foul up the fuel lines
with salt water.
Captain the sea is brutal.
We need more knots to outrun it.
Bridge to Engine Control.
This is the captain speaking.
You down in there the engine room,
I want power.
Power on the starboard engine, do you hear?
Emergency flank power.
Do you want this ship to go down?
We're in a typhoon.
Close that door
and lock it.
- Sir, I've relieved the watch.
- Pass the word to put on life jackets.
It's difficult holding her, sir.
The wheel feels loose.
Captain, I don't know if we can keep on riding
with our stern to the wind.
Those are fleet orders,
Mr. Maryk.
I still think the depth charges
should be put on safe.
Sir, the depth charges are on safe.
Mr. Keefer gave the order to set them
Why wasn't I told these things? I can't go
steaming around with a lot of dead charges.
- Sir, I told Mr. Keefer...
- You speak when you're spoken too.
Mr. Keith, put this man on report
for insolence and neglect of duty.
While you're at it, get another helmsman.
Keep that idiots face out of my sight.
- But Stillwell's our best man.
- Will you stop this back talking?
Is there no one left on this ship who
pays attention to my orders?
Engine room reports #1 switchboard
shorted out by salt water...
Shifting to number two.
We're falling off to starboard now, sir.
Captain we're listing to.
Try backing the starboard engine.
Back the starboard engine!
- Back the starboard engine.
- Aye, aye, sir!
Willie, look in the radar shack.
See if there are any ships near us.
Aye, aye, sir.
If we keep our running with stern to the wind,
we'll roll over.
Captain, the radars are jammed.
There's no sign of the fleet.
Passing 2-2-5...
Swinging around faster.
Captain, we have to maneuver
for the safety of the ship.
We received no orders to move
to maneuver at discretion.
Fleet course is 1-8-0.
Sir, how do you know what
the fleet orders are now?
We can call the fleet Commander
and tell him we're in trouble.
We're not in any trouble.
Heading 2-4-5!
I can't hold the wheel, sir!
Captain,
back the starboard engine!
Captain!
Stilwell,
hold it a hard right!
- Ease your rudder to standard.
- Rudder easing to standard, sir.
Heading 3-2-5.
She's coming around slower, sir.
Stay on this bearing heading into the wind.
Steady on 0-0-0.
Who gave those orders?
Fleet course is 1-8-0.
Captain,
we're in serious trouble.
Mr. Maryk, if you question my decisions once
more, I'll order you off this bridge.
Helsman, come left.
Stilwell, steady as you go.
Willie, note the time.
Captain, I'm sorry,
but you're a sick man.
I'm relieving you as captain of this ship
under Article 184.
I don't know what you are talking about.
Helmsman, left 1-8-0.
Mr. Keith, what do I do?
You're the Officer of the Deck.
I told you to come left,
now come left, and fast.
I'm sorry sir, but you're not issuing orders
on this bridge anymore.
I've relieved you.
I take full responsibility.
Mr. Maryk, you're under arrest.
Go below to your cabin.
Left to 1-8-0.
No, to right standard rudder.
Come to new course 0-0-0.
Mr. Keith, what do I do?
Come north, Stilwell.
Mr. Maryk has taken command.
Call your relief, Mr. Keith.
You're under arrest, too.
All officers not on watch, report to the bridge.
This is Mr. Maryk.
- What's up?
- I have just relieved the captain.
He will continue to be treated
with the utmost courtesy.
But from now on, I will give all orders.
I take full responsibility for this action.
Don't kid yourself, Mr. Keith backed you up.
He'll pay the same as you will.
You officers, if you know what's good for you,
tell them to stop, while they can.
You officers approve?
Do you, Mr. Keefer?
- It isn't up to Mr. Keefer to approve, Captain.
- You'll all hang for conspiracy to mutiny.
Everybody back to their stations.
Hold the course 0-0-0.
- It's right over there, mister.
- Thank you.
Yes?
Yes, this is Ensign Keith.
New York?
Thank you.
Hello?
Hello?
- May?
- Willie, I've been trying to get you all day.
- Are you all right?
- Well, I'm OK. How are you?
Willie,
an officer from your ship called.
Ensign Harding?
He told me that you were in trouble.
Willie,
I'm worried.
Is your mother there
with you?
- No, she's in Washington. Uncle Loyd's sick.
- Sorry to hear it.
May,
it was wonderful of you to phone.
- May... darling.
- Willie, please don't.
What an idiot I was.
I could have married you in the
most beautiful place in the world.
- I'll always regret that I didn't for the rest of my life.
- Don't... please.
It's over.
It's all in the past.
But I want you to know that I love you,
and I'll never forget you.
Goodbye, Willie.
Thank you.
- Mr. Maryk?
- I'm Maryk
My name is
Barney Greenwald.
Pleased to meet you.
Have a crack-up?
Yep.
- Are you our lawyer?
- Well, I'm a lawyer.
- This is Ensign Keith, Lieutenant Keefer.
- Keith. You're the co-defendant.
Yes, sir.
- And you, Mr. Keefer?
- I'm holding his coat.
I'm a friend of the family.
That's pretty flip under the circumstances,
Mr. Keefer.
Sorry, I was on board the Caine,
communications officer.
I will be frank with you two.
I read the preliminary investigation very carefully,
and I think that what you've done stinks.
If that's the way you feel about it,
then why are you taking the case?
I didn't say
I'd take it.
I told legal I would have
a talk with Mr. Maryk.
Rather I take it or not depends
on what he has to say.
Steve, maybe you better
get yourself another lawyer.
Try it. Eight other officers have
already turned it down.
I don't want to upset you too much,
but at the moment,
you have an excellent chance
of being hanged.
We'll answer anything
you want to know, Mr. Greenwald.
Alright, Mr. Maryk, which are you?
A fool or a mutineer?
There's no third possibility.
I guess the only way I could prove I was right
was to let the ship go down.
Three ships were lost in the typhoon,
you know.
Sure, and 194 stayed afloat without the
executive officer relieving the skipper.
There wasn't any other choice.
Hold it Willie.
OK, maybe I was a fool,
but I'm not a mutineer.
He should get a medal
for what he did.
He had a paranoid skipper who went to pieces
when the ship was in danger.
And he saved the ship.
The Navy has three psychiatrists
who are prepared testify...
that Capt. Queeg is completely sane.
Sure...
paranoids are clever.
They walk a thin dividing line
between sanity and lunacy.
Are you a psychiatrist,
Mr. Keefer?
No, I'm a writer. It's my business
to be a judge of human behavior.
I see. And you were the first one to notice
the captain's
Yes.
You explained this all very carefully to Mr. Maryk,
of course.
- I discussed it, yes.
- Well, that's an interesting point.
Would you be prepared to repeat it
on the witness stand?
Why not?
Mr. Keefer, you ought to take a look
at Article 186 of Navy regulations.
"An officer relieving his commanding officer,
or recommending such action...
"Together with all others
who so counsel...
"and must be prepared
to justify such action."
That's confusing the issue.
I'm not on trial.
If I were,
I'd take the rap with the others.
Too bad we can't use you as
an expert on psychiatry.
After all,
you made the diagnosis.
Yes.
The atmosphere is getting a little thick
in here.
If you can get along without me,
I'll wait in the hall.
Tom had nothing to do with it.
It was my decision.
Nobody counseled me,
nobody told me what to do.
- Sure.
- Will you take the case?
I'd much rather prosecute.
Well, I guess I can't
blame you.
- I'll take it.
- How do we plead?
- Your case depends on Maryk.
- Well, then, how do I plead?
Not guilty,
of course.
You're a great naval hero.
Charge:
Specification: "In that Steven Maryk,
Lieutenant, United States Naval Reserve.
"While serving on board the USS Caine,
did on or about July 31, 1944.
"relieve Lt. Commander Phillip Francis Queeg,
U.S. Navy
"Who was then and there was engaged
lawfully in the exercise of his command,
"the United States then being in
a state of war."
Steven Maryk, Lt. U.S. Navy you heard the
charge and specifications preferred against you.
How say you to the specification?
Guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
How say you to the charge?
Guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
Gentlemen, the prosecution
is prepared to prove...
that the removal of Lt. Commander Queeg
was not justified...
by any provision of
the U.S. Navy regulations.
And consequently, constituted the making of
a mutiny against legal authority.
We will also submit
qualified psychiatric testimony...
establishing without a doubt...
that Lt. Commander Queeg is a sane
and intelligent officer,
and should not
have been relieved.
No statement at this time.
In order to establish circumstances,
the prosecution would like to call...
as it's first witness,
Ensign Willis Stewart Keith.
Mr. Keith, where you the Officer of the Deck
on the DMS Caine...
during the morning
of the 31st of July?
Yes, sir.
Was the Captain relieved of command by the
Executive Officer during that watch?
Yes, sir.
Do you know why the Executive Officer
took the action he did?
I do.
The Captain lost control of himself and the ship
was in imminent danger of foundering.
Have you ever been in a ship
that foundered?
No, sir.
- Mr. Keith, how long have you been in the Navy?
- A little over a year, sir.
Do you know how many years
Lt. Commander Queeg served at sea?
No.
As a matter of fact, Lt. Commander Queeg
has served over eight years.
I ask you, which of you is better qualified
to judge if a ship is foundering?
Myself, sir.
When I am in possession
of my faculties...
and Lt. Commander Queeg is not.
Tell me, Mr. Keith. Just how would you
describe this loss of faculties?
Did the Captain rave
or make insane gestures?
Well,
no, sir.
After being relieved,
did the Captain go violently crazy?
Well, the Captain was never wild or raving
either before or after being relieved.
There are other forms
of mental illness.
Thank you for
your expert opinion.
Are you aware the Captain has been pronounced
completely rational by three qualified psychiatrists?
They weren't on the bridge
of the Caine during that typhoon, sir.
- Did you like the Captain, Mr. Keith?
- At first I did, yes, sir.
And later?
Well, I thought he was incompetent
and unfair.
He blamed the members of the crew
for his own mistakes.
And He rode the men
too hard.
- Yourself included?
- Yes, sir.
You ended up by hating Captain Queeg?
Yes, sir.
Now, let's come to
the morning of 31st of July, Mr. Keith.
Was your decision
to obey Mr. Maryk...
based upon your judgment that the Captain
had gone crazy...
or was it based on your hatred
of Capt. Queeg?
Mr. Keith, it's contempt of court
to refuse to answer questions...
except on sufficient grounds.
All I can say is that I believe Mr. Maryk
did the right thing, sir.
No further questions.
Mr. Keith, I would like to ask if you have ever
heard
the expression
- Would you repeat that, please.
-
- Yes, sir, I've heard it.
- Was it a nickname?
Yes, for Captain Queeg.
- What did it imply?
- It implied Cowardice.
I object. I move that question and answer
be struck from the record...
as an unnecessary attack on the honor
of an Naval officer.
Mr. Greenwald, the career of an officer
with a 14 year...
unblemished record
is involved here.
The court understands your zeal,
but I warn you,
you bear full responsibility
for your conduct in this case.
The court will hold in abeyance
to the prosecution's motion.
Did that nickname have
anything to do with the typhoon?
- No, sir.
- That's all.
- No further questions.
- The court has no questions.
Mr. Keith, you are warned not to discuss
your testimony with anyone...
except the parties to the trial
and the accused.
You're excused.
The ship was rolling bad.
I couldn't hold her.
The Captain wanted me to come left,
the Exec wanted me to come right.
- Which did you do?
- I obeyed Mr. Maryk, sir.
Why?
Well, Mr. Keith told me that
Mr. Maryk had taken command.
Did the captain act crazy?
No, sir.
- Did Mr. Maryk act crazy?
- No, sir.
- Did the Captain seemed scared?
- No, sir.
- Did Mr. Maryk seemed scared?
- No, sir.
Did anyone?
Just me. I was dam...
I was plenty scared.
Did you like Captain Queeg?
I liked him, but not a lot.
But I liked him.
- He acted strange.
- Was it strange he cleaned up the Caine?
No, sir.
Was it strange he made
the men get haircuts?
No, sir.
- Was it strange he was strict
about Navy regulations?
No, sir.
Evidently, what you thought strange
were attempts...
to make good sailors
of his crew.
That's all.
What do those campaign stars
represent?
Well...
What do they represent?
This silver star is the Coral Sea,
Midway, Guadalcanal, Tulagi...
- That's all.
- Call Lt. Thomas Keefer.
Mr. Keefer, when did you first learn
about Capt. Queeg's relief?
Mr. Maryk called us
to the bridge.
When we arrived, he told us
he had assumed full command.
Did Captain Queeg show any external signs
of being sick?
Well, in the height of a typhoon nobody
on board a DMS looks very well.
Lt. Keefer,
didn't you realize...
that Capt. Queeg's warning
to the other officers...
about collusion in mutiny
was well founded?
Yes, I did,
sir.
Then why, as the next senior officer,
did you take no action?
I wasn't present when the Captain
was relieved.
So, I don't know what
he might have done...
in the critical moments  to convince
the Executive Officer he was sick.
I decided for the safety of the ship that my
best course was to obey Mr. Maryk's order.
Until such time higher authority either
endorsed or overruled his action.
Mr. Keefer,
during all the period Captain Queeg...
was in command
of the Caine.
Did you ever observe any
evidence of insanity in him?
I'm afraid I can't answer that question
intelligently, not being a psychiatrist.
Mr. Keefer, did you ever have any reason to
think Capt. Queeg might be insane?
Greewald: Objection, the witness
is not an expert.
Matters of opinion are
not permissible evidence.
Judge:
Strike it from the record.
Mr. Keefer,
at anytime prior to 31st of July,
did you know that Mr. Maryk suspected
Capt Queeg of being mentally ill?
Yes, sir. Mr. Maryk showed me a medical log
he had written on Capt. Queeg's behavior.
Did you believe that log justified
the relief of Captain Queeg?
- Well, sir...
- Yes or no, please?
No, sir.
Mr. Maryk was
a close friend of mine.
He persuaded Mr. Keith and me to
go with him to see Admiral Halsey.
When we arrived on board the flagship
I told him as forcibly as I could,
that the log didn't
justify such action.
And that we all would be liable to a charged
of combining to make a mutiny.
Were you surprised later
when Mr. Maryk relieved the captain?
Yes, sir. I was flabbergasted.
- Were you pleased, Mr. Keefer?
- I've said Mr. Maryk was a close friend.
I was badly disturbed.
I anticipated that at best, he would be
involved in a great difficulty.
No further questions.
No questions.
Does Defense Counsel intended to recall
the witness at a later time?
No, sir.
- No cross-examination?
- No, sir.
Witness, excused.
But Barney,
he's lying.
Every time he opens his mouth,
he gets you into more trouble.
Forget it.
I want one hero, not two mutineers.
Call Dr Dixon,
please.
Dr Dixon,
please.
How did it go,
Tom?
Raw deal. You know.
You were on the hot seat yourself.
Sure, I didn't know whether
I was coming or going.
But you're the old word-king.
You know what you were doing.
Yeah...
Yeah,
I knew what I was doing.
Doctor, may I ask you
as a psychiatrist,
is it possible for a sane man to
perform offensive or foolish acts?
It happens every day.
Assuming for the moment,
this is a hypothetical question...
Assuming that the captain's conduct
was harsh and oppressive,
and often showed
bad judgment.
Would that be inconsistent
with your diagnosis of him?
No, no, my colleagues and I didn't find
Lt. Commander Queeg a perfect officer.
We found a absence
of mental illness.
Then you would still say that the defended
was unjustified in relieving him?
From a psychiatric standpoint,
completely unjustified.
Your witness.
Doctor my background is legal, not medical.
Forgive me if I ask some elementary questions.
It's perfectly alright.
Now doctor, you said in previous testimony
that Lt. Commander Queeg,
like all adults,
had problems which he handled well.
Could you describe
the problems?
I object. Lt. Commander Queeg is not
on trial here. Lt. Maryk is.
This question constitutes irrelevant probing
of medical confidence.
I rely on the judgment
of the court.
Evidence regarding Lt. Commander Queeg's
mental make-up...
is of the utmost importance
to my case.
The question is material.
Objection overruled.
The doctor may answer within
the limits of medical discretion.
The reporter will
repeat the question.
"You said that Lt. Commander Queeg,
like all adults,
The overall problem is one of inferiority
arising from an unfavorable childhood...
and aggravated by some adult experiences.
- What were those adult experiences?
- He'd undergone a lot of strain.
Long, arduous, combat duty.
I think that's about all I can say.
- Would he be incline to admit mistakes?
- Well, none of us are.
- Would he be a perfectionist then?
- Yes.
Inclined to hound subordinates
about small details?
Yes.
Would he be incline to
think that people were hostile to him?
Yes, that'd be part
of the picture, yes.
And if criticized, would he feel
that he was being unjustly persecuted?
I say it's all one pattern
stemming from one premise...
that he must try
to be perfect.
Now doctor, you have testified
that the following symptoms...
exist in Lt. Commander Queeg's behavior:
Rigidity of personality, feelings of
persecution, unreasonable suspicion,
a mania for perfection, and a neurotic
certainty that he is always in the right.
Doctor, isn't there one psychiatric term
for this illness?
- I never said there was any illness.
- Thank you for the correction, sir.
What would you call a personality
that had all these symptoms?
A paranoid personality.
But that is not a disabling illness.
- What kind of personality, Doctor?
- Paranoid.
Thank you.
If I may speak, sir. I would like to protest
the counsel's twisting of words.
There's a big difference between real mental
illness and minor mental disturbances.
Let me put it this way,
Doctor.
Could Captain Queeg have been
disabled by the severe strain of command?
- That's absurdly hypothetical.
- Is it?
- Have you ever had any sea duty, doctor?
- No.
- Have you ever been at sea?
- No.
How long have you been in the Navy?
Five months.
Have you ever had any dealings
with ship captains before this case?
No.
Then I suggest that you can not
set yourself up...
as an authority on
the strain of command,
and thus you may be completely wrong
about Capt Queeg.
- Your witness.
- One minute, Doctor.
It seems counsel for defense
has raised an interesting point.
Now in private practice,
did you ever have patients...
who had to deal
with complicated command decisions?
Men such as plant managers,
industrialists, etc...
Yes,
quite a few.
Including some fliers,
who have to decide questions
of life and death every day.
I've written a book
on the subject.
And in those cases, could you
detect where a neurosis...
might damage the ability to make decisions
correctly and at the right time?
Absolutely.
And in your examination
of Lt. Commander Queeg.
- And you found no such damage, is that right?
- Absolutely right.
Thank you, Doctor.
That'll be all.
- Smart guy, Charlie.
- He's sure gonna bear down on me.
And that's the way
I saw it.
I thought it was my duty
as a naval officer.
Captain Queeg was mentally ill
and I had to take over.
And I tell you honestly, if I had to do it again,
I'd do it.
Thank you, Mr. Maryk.
Your witness, sir.
Mr. Maryk,
just a few questions.
Would you say your grades
in high school were average?
- Lower than average.
- And in college?
Lower than average.
What training have you had in psychiatry,
or medicine?
None.
Where did you get the idea
that Capt Queeg was mentally ill?
- Out of books...
- What books, name the titles.
Oh... I can't remember them.
- Mr. Maryk, define schizophrenia.
- I can't.
- What's a manic-depressive?
- I don't know.
What's the difference between
?
I don't know.
In truth,
than Mr. Maryk,
you don't know what you're talking about
when you discuss mental illness.
I didn't say I know
much about it.
Yet, you thought you knew enough
to commit an act of outright mutiny.
I wanted to save the ship.
But doctors, responsible doctors,
Mr, Maryk,
have found the Captain wasn't mentally ill,
haven't they?
- They weren't in the ship.
- But, isn't the reverse possible?
Mr. Maryk,
isn't it possible that under pressure,
you became erratic and couldn't understand
the captain's sound decisions?
- Isn't that possible?
- It's possible.
Between the Captain
and his Executive Officer,
who is presumed by the Navy to have
the better judgment in ship handling?
- The captain.
- One last question, Mr. Maryk.
If the diagnosis of expert doctors
is correct,
then you're guilty as charged,
aren't you?
I guess,
maybe so.
- No more questions.
- No further questions.
You may step down,
Mr. Maryk.
Take it easy. You've just seen the first act.
The finale's still to come.
Good afternoon,
gentlemen.
I assumed command of an extremely sloppy,
badly-handled ship.
I was determined to bring
the ship into line.
Lt. Maryk, I might say,
opposed me from the very first.
Maybe he thought I was crazy
to keep trying.
In your judgment, was your ship
on the verge of foundering...
when the Executive Officer
assumed command?
Well, as you gentlemen know, in a typhoon
is an extreme hazard at all times,
but the ship was riding well.
Lt. Maryk, however,
went into a panic and ran amok.
He acted under the disillusion that he,
and he alone, could save the ship.
Ensign Willis Keith,
a totally unreliable and disloyal officer,
combined with him against me
at this crucial time.
Bad luck for them really.
I bear them no malice.
I'm extremely sorry
for them.
No more questions.
A word of caution before you proceed
with the examination, Mr. Greenwald.
The court recognizes the defense
is compelled...
to try to challenge the competence
of Lt. Commander Queeg.
Nevertheless, all the requirements
of legal ethics...
- and military respect remain in force.
- Thank you, sir.
Mr. Queeg, during a period
when the Caine was towing targets.
Did you ever steam over your
own tow line and cut it?
Objection.
I beg the courts indulgence.
But, I must say, the defense outrages
the dignity of this proceeding.
The judge advocate wants the defense to
switch to a guilty plead.
He thinks the report of the psychiatrist
closes the case.
But I say it is up to you
line naval officers, not doctors...
to judge the captain's performance of duty.
And I must review that performance of duty
for the navy to render a judgment.
Objection overruled.
Now sir, did you ever steam over
your own tow line and cut it?
Well sir, I for one, am happy to dispose
of this particular slander.
During the time we were towing the target,
I noticed some anti-aircraft bursts
close to board.
Naturally,
I turned to avoid them.
And you continued to turned
in a full circle?
Well, my helmsman,
a very unreliable man,
failed to warn me we that we were
coming around 360 degrees.
I caught it in time
and instantly reversed course.
To the best of my knowledge,
we didn't steam over the tow line.
I see. Well, besides the anti-aircraft burst,
did nothing else distract you?
No,
not that I recall.
Captain, weren't you engaged
in reprimanding a seaman...
named "Lugatch" at length,
for having his shirt-tail out...
while the ship turned 360 degrees?
Well yes, I reprimanded him,
but that only took two seconds.
Un huh
Now on the morning the Caine escorted
attack boats of Marines to the beach.
Did your orders include
dropping a yellow dye marker?
- I don't recall.
- Did you drop a dye marker?
I don't recall.
Well Captain, didn't you steam several hundred
yards ahead of the attack boats,
drop a yellow dye marker,
and retire at high speed, leaving the boats
to make the beach on their own?
The question is abusive
and fragrantly leading.
Mr. Greenwald, there can be a
no more serious charge...
against an officer than
cowardice under fire.
Sir,
may I make one thing clear?
It is not the defense's contention that
Lt. Commander Queeg is a coward.
Quite the contrary.
The defense assume that no man who raises
to command a US naval ship...
can possibly be a coward.
And therefore, if he commits
questionable acts under fire,
the explanation
must be elsewhere.
You may resume
your examination.
Captain, you seem to be the victim
of constantly disloyal officers.
Now, I didn't say that.
Only some of them were disloyal.
- Mr. Keith and Mr. Maryk, for instance?
- Yes.
Mr. Queeg, this is a fitness report you wrote
on Mr. Maryk, 1 July, 1944.
One month before
he relieved you.
Do you recognize it?
Yes, I do.
Do you mind reading your
comments on Mr. Maryk?
I don't believe the court can hear you,
Mr. Queeg.
"This officer has improved in performance
and duties since his last fitness report."
"He's consistently loyal, unflagging,
thorough, courageous, and efficient."
"He's recommended
for transfer to the regular navy."
Now, in relation to that report,
would like to say that...
Thank you, sir.
Captain, did you ever turn
your ship upside down...
in the vain search for
a key that did not exist?
I don't know what lies have been
sworn to in this court,
But I would like to set you straight on
this matter right here and now.
A key definitely did exist.
May it please the court. The witness is
understandably agitated by this ordeal,
and I request a brief recess to give him a brief...
I don't want a recess.
I'll answer all questions right here, and now.
- Did you conduct such a search?
- Yes, I did.
As usual, my disloyal officers failed me,
and the key couldn't be found.
Is it a matter of actual fact that wasn't
this whole fuss over a quart of strawberries?
The pilfering of food
in large amounts or small,
is one of the most serious occurrences
on board ship.
Yes, but didn't you learn that the mess boys
had eaten the strawberries...
and that you were conducting
a search for an imaginary key?
I repeat,
the key was not imaginary.
And I don't know anything about
the mess boys eating strawberries.
Captain, have you no recollection of a
conversation with an Ensign Harding...
just prior to him
leaving the Caine?
What about?
Didn't Esign Harding tell you that
the mess boys ate the strawberries?
All I remember is that,
he was very grateful for his transfer.
His wife was ill in the states.
Captain, do you know
where Ensign Harding is now?
I have no way of knowing.
Ensign Harding is in San Diego.
His wife is fully recovered.
He has already been summoned and can be
flown up here in three hours if necessary.
Would it serve any useful purpose
to have him testify?
No, I...
I...
I don't see
any need of that.
Now that I recall, he might have
said something about mess boys,
and then again
he might not.
I questioned so many men, and Harding
was not the most reliable officer.
I'm afraid the defense has no other recourse
than to produce Ensign Harding.
Now, there's no need
for that!
I know exactly what he'll tell you,
lies!
No different from any other officer
in the wardroom.
They were all disloyal.
I tried to run the ship properly, by the book,
but they fought me at every turn.
If the crew wanted to walk around with their
shirt-tails hanging out,
that's alright,
let them.
Take the tow line... defective equipment.
No more, no less
But they encouraged the crew to
go around scoffing at me,
spreading wild rumors about
steaming in circles.
And then
I was to blame for Lt Maryk's
incompetence and poor seamanship.
Lt Maryk was the perfect officer,
but not Capt Queeg.
Ah... but the strawberries,
that's where I had them.
They laughed at me
and made jokes.
But I proved beyond the
shadow of the doubt...
with geometric logic that a duplicate key to
the wardroom icebox did existed.
I would have produced that key,
if they hadn't pulled the Caine out of action.
I know now they were only trying
to protect some fellow officer...
Naturally, I can only cover
these things from memory.
If I've left anything out,
why, just ask me specific questions.
And, I'll be glad to answer them
one by one.
No further questions,
sir.
The court is closed.
"For he's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly good fellow
"for he's a jolly good fellow
that nobody can deny. "
No, baby, there are no girls here.
Just the officers of the Caine.
What, darling?
Hey, Steve, make them pipe down, will you.
Knock it off, fellas.
Ole Willie is talking to his girl.
Hi, Tom.
Hi, fellas.
- Steve.
- Hello, Tom.
I didn't think you had the guts
to come around.
I didn't have the guts
not to.
Steve.
I want to thank you for not telling the fellas
about what happened.
Of course I'm delighted about
the way things turned out.
So, It's over and done with.
Look, you can take
a plane tonight.
I'm getting a new ship and a new skipper,
but we'll have plenty of time to get married.
We'll let my mother afterwards.
Please, May.
I love you, darling. I love you!
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Hey, Steve, Tom, that was May.
We're...
Well, well, well. The officers
of the Caine in happy celebration.
- What are you Barney, kind of tight?
- Sure, I've got a guilty conscience.
I defended you Steve because I found
the wrong man was on trial.
So I torpedoed Queeg
for you.
I had to torpedo him.
And I feel sick about it.
OK Barney,
take it easy.
You know something?
When I was studying law, and
Mr. Keefer here was writing his stories.
And you Willie was tearing up the dear
old playing fields of Princeton.
Who was standing guard over this fat,
dumb happy country of ours, aye?
Not us. Oh no, we knew you couldn't
make any money in the service.
Who did the dirty work for us?
Queeg did, and a lot of other guys.
Tough, sharp guys
who didn't crack up like Queeg.
But no matter what, Capt Queeg endangered
the ship and lives of the men.
He didn't endanger anybodies lives.
You did, all of you.
You're a fine bunch
of officers.
You said yourself
he cracked.
I'm glad you brought that up Mr. Painter.
That's a very pretty point.
You know, I left out one detail in court martial.
It wouldn't have helped our case any.
Tell me Steve, after the  incident,
Queeg came to you for help,
and you turned him down. Didn't you?
Yes, we did.
You didn't approve of his conduct as an officer.
He wasn't worthy of your loyalty.
So you turned on him. You ragged him.
You made up songs about him.
If you'd given Queeg
the loyalty he needed,
do you suppose the whole issue
would have come up in the typhoon?
You're an honest man, Steve,
I'm asking you.
Do you think it would have been necessary
for you to take over?
It probably
wouldn't have been necessary.
- If that's true, we were guilty.
- Ah... you're learning, Willie.
You learn you don't work with a captain
because of the way he parts his hair.
You work with him because he's got the job,
or you're no good.
Well, the case is over.
You're all safe.
It was like
shooting fish in a barrel.
And now we come to the man
who should have stood trial.
The Caine's favorite author.
The Shakespeare whose testimony
nearly sunk us all.
Tell them,
Keefer.
No, you go ahead.
You're telling it better.
You ought to read his testimony.
He never even heard of Capt Queeg.
- Let's forget it, Barney.
- Queeg was sick, he couldn't help himself.
But you, you're real healthy. Only you didn't
have one tenth the guts he had.
Except I never fooled myself,
Mr. Greenwald.
I want to drink a toast to you,
Mr. Keefer.
From the beginning you hated the Navy.
And then you thought up this whole idea.
You managed to keep your skirts nice and
starched and clean, even in the court martial.
Steve Maryk will always be remembered
as a mutineer...
But you...
You'll publish your novel, you'll make a
million bucks, marry a big movie star.
And for the rest of your life,
you'll live with your conscience.
If you have any.
Here's to the real author of
Here's to you,
Mr. Keefer.
If you want to do anything about it,
I'll be outside.
I'm a lot drunker than you are,
so it'll be a fair fight.
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Willie.
Keith!
Attention on deck.
Keith.
Yes, sir.
Take her out.
Aye, aye, sir.
- Single up all lines!
-
- Stand by to cast off!
