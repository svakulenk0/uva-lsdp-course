Yes, I read you, Pelham 1-2-3.
This is control center.
Who is this?
It's me, man! I didn't wanna
call until everything was ready.
I understand, I understand,
Pelham 1-2-3. Who the hell is this?
This is the man, who's
gonna rock this city.
This is the man who's gonna
give this city a run for it's money.
Now look up. Look up at your screen
and you tell me what you see.
- You see what I done?
- I see it.
One car is much more manageable
than 10, with  the man power I got.
Mr motorman's gonna tell you all
about it, tell 'em what we got here.
They... they got hostages, lot's of 'em
and... and they got machine guns?
- It's Jerry?
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's right. You check
that you understand that.
I checked. I understand.
Didn't I tell you to knock first?
Good, because this is what is called
a cash trans-action.
Now you understand
commodities? Don't you.
You know, pork bellies, gold, crude?
Listen... listen no disrespect
but... maybe... Maybe
I'm not the guy you
should be talking to.
Oh no, you are exactly the guy
I wanna talk to. Now I want
you to look at the ticker and
you tell me what is the going rate
for a new york hostage today?
Do you think million
dollars is too much? I do?
I think it's corny. Get your
calculator out, you got one.
- You don't have a calculator?
- Yeah, we got one. I got one.
Okay, good. Add this up, you got
This is 526,315.79.
Now times that by 19.
- What you got?
- Who is he? A goddamn accountant?
That's 10 million.
- What you got?
- That comes up to 10 million, plus 1 cent.
That is a deal! Now you call the
mayor and tell him the price.
And you tell him I want 100
thousand and $100 bills, you got that.
I got it. What about the 1 cent?
Well you keep that 1 cent,
that's your brokers fee.
now I want the rest, in plain suitcases the kind with
the wheels and the deportable handle. Okay.
Now this is not a futures
contract this is a spotre,
that means there's a time limit
on it. Okay you got that?
What do you think is a fair, time limit?
You know, I don't know,
I mean, I'm really just a guy
Come on give me a time limit.
Give me a fair time limit.
Thursday.
I was thinking more like an hour,
now what does your watch say?
Oh that's exactly what
my watch says! So at 3:13
I want that money here, mother fucker.
and after that, there is a late fee.
What do you think that
late fees going to be?
Come on, tell me what will it be.
Your going to kill... the passengers.
Oh commodities is
what I will start to kill.
One for every minute past the
dead line, I am forced to wait.
They become more valuable this
way, they still have the same price.
He's only rattleing, he's
never gonna pull this off.
Don't tell me, tell him.
- Who the hell is this guy?
- I don't know who it is!
Garber. Just stay with it.
What's your name? I didn't get your
name, what's your name my man?
- My name?
- What's your name?
Tell him? Garber.
Garber, okay. Now seriously, man.
In 59 minutes, I'm gonna
start killing passengers.
So my advice to you, get on the
phone and get the mayor notified, now!
Listen, I mean, I'm just
a civil service employee,
I can't get hold of the mayor.
Well that's your problem man,
that's not mine! That's like,
Who's responsible for who
lives and who dies in, new york?
That's the, new york city's problem!
Get the fuck of the radio and
notify the mayor, mother fucker!
Okay.
Nine months of this and I'm free.
Next may, I'll get inaugurated be
sitting in central bay on the beach,
with a piña colada and I will never
have to ride the subway ever again!
- Never say never, sir.
- Never!
Alright. What's next for the afternoon?
East harlem elementary at 2:30 you were supposed
to read "A cat in the hat" to the third grade.
Everytime I go to the schools, I get sick.
They all have runny nose's.
Call Dr. Katz tell him,
I want him waiting at
the school with a flu shot.
- He's in car 3.
- Yeah.
What happened?
Somebody just hijacked a 6 train.
It stopped in the tunnel between.
Between 51st and 22nd.
Another idiot with a gun
- What do we know?
- It's not clear but, I have a car waiting for us downstairs.
The subway will get us there faster.
Alright. Have the doors closed,
tell them will meet them at 59 street.
Tell the conductor this is now an express.
We're skipping the next 5 stops.
- What?
- This is not right!
Hold on, hold on. Everybody
will get where they need to go,
we'll make all the stops.
Maybe he's not such a
douchebag after all, huh?
That's funny!
I think you should be the
one to get a call like this.
The negotiating team
will be here in 5 minutes
and the mayor's been notified.
- Gonna tell him?
- Get the fuck out of here!
- My shift's over in 10 minutes.
- What are you staring at?
Your face, trying to remember
it for when it's not here anymore.
You going to start in on me now?
Damn right I'm going to start in
on you. Don't fuck this up, Garber!
You wanna do it?
- It's your station, it's your call.
- Oh, it's my call now?
That's right, your call.
Pelham 1-2-3, come in, this is rail
control centre. Are you there?
Gerber, baby boy! What's up?
"Garber". Just wanted to let you
know the, mayor's been notified.
Think he'll pay?
I don't know. I'm just the... a...
what did you call me? The broker.
No! no ,no you represents the
city of new york right now, buddy!
Well, I can tell you that your dealing
with one of the old time bureaucracy.
I know that, I mean it takes time.
Well, then you better
fix the bureaucracy,
because when the time comes,
these motherfuckers, these
hostages are gonna go real quick!
You got it. You got it.
Any other demands?
Yeah well no fucking
pizza for 'em either, man!
No, I mean... are you guys like terrorist's?
Do I sound like a terrorist?
Do I terrorize you?
Actually, you don't but um...
not that I've ever talked to one.
So... So... What?
This is just about money?
- Oh is there anything else?
- There's not dying...
Yeah, well... you know you live you
die, you either go with the current,
or you bite and you all
end up in the same place.
Where's that, Jersey?
Yeah, you watch it.
I was born there man.
No, no I'm just saying...
You're up in the motorman's cab so
it means you know your on the radio,
which means that
your an easy target...
You gotta know the drill.
Yeah, I know that soon I won't be
alone and if I'm the first to get shot.
I'm the first of many to get shot!
That's correct, but then
you'll still be dead.
Death is an improvement on alot of
things I can think of, buddy boy!
Sounds like he slept with my ex.
You know we all owe, god a death.
I'm a man who pays his debt's.
are you a man who pay's his debt's?
Yeah, yeah, sure... TV, cable, and my mortgage...
That's a little like dying once a month.
This is only a part.
Oh you're married!
You're a married man.
- Maybe...
- No, you're married, man!
Married men have mortgages.
What about you?
You got a mortgage?
I don't know, Garber. Why don't you
tell me and then we'll both know?
I do not know... I mean you, I'm sure
someone out there loves you dearly and a...
you know would
be worried about you.
Like I said, your in the motorman's
cab, you got no covers, cops on the way...
You know circumstances are "my" protection,
Cause right now, you know...
hostages are a good insurance,
by the way I see it.
I'm pretty well protected.
You know this reminds me
of being in a confession.
Are you a, catholic? I'm
married, are you a catholic?
Maybe... I don't know.
Your a catholic and a
catholic, a good catholic
would know that his got a
train load of innocent people.
I mean you don't want to kill
innocent people, do you?
A good, catholic knows
that know body is innocent.
and I'm not going to kill all these
hostages and give up my leverage.
No. I hope you know, what you're doing.
Yeah well it's running like
a swiss watch down here.
So don't worry about it.
So, what do I call you, anyway?
Call me, Ryder.
As in "train rider"?
Call me with Ryder...
with a "Y". Ryder...
I like you, Garber!
I do like you, man.
You may be the last
friend I ever make.
Well, I hope your wrong, Mr. Ryder.
But uh... you know I'm just a guy...
I'm just a guy on the
other end of the mike.
Oh, you don't think
this was meant to be?
you don't think this
was fate, you and me?
I don't know, you know, things
happen that lead to other things...
and maybe this was one
of them but a... thats it,
I never... get excited about coincidence.
Well you got 50 fucking
minutes, so check me.
That's right, 50 minutes. Check.
Then don't call me, unless you got news.
- You got it.
- Mother fucker!
GB, you're fucking good, man!
Okay, move it the other way.
Alright, come on move it!
The other way!
Peter, move it back a little less.
Got it!
All right! We got it!
- Who's talked to these jokers?
- That would be me.
Under my supervision, who are you?
Lieutenant Camonetti,
NYPD, hostage negotiations.
John Johnson, chief transportation officer
Walter Garber. I'm a...
consult dispatch. Right now
What can you tell me, Walter?
His name is, Ryder,
with a "Y" and a...
his asking for 10 million dollars by 3:13.
- Good, he's looking towards the future.
- Right.
Did he say what he'd do if
he doesn't get the money?
Yeah, he said he'd kill a passenger,
every minute we go over.
- Starting at 3:13 pm?
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?
- He's smart...
If he's so smart, why's he
got himself, so fucking stupid?
- Is he on the train radio?
- Yeah, yeah. We can get him right here.
Any chance we can get
a signal down there?
We'd like to get him on
one of our cell phones.
No. No there's no chance,
not where he is. uh-uh.
What's this, leverage, stock trade?
Yeah, it's weird, he's like a
money guy, like wall street.
he talked about the passengers
like they were... commodities.
- Catholic?
- Yes, I think he's, catholic.
For christ sake, Garber! you gonna
tell us what he's zodiac sign is?
No, I'm just saying in my
opinion I think he's, catholic.
He asked me if the guy is catholic. I wrote
it down. I'm giving him my opinion.
Unlike other people around
here, I actually have an opinion....
Fellas, can we settle this
domestic dispute... later?
- Absolutely!
- Why do you think he's, catholic?
Well, I think he's, catholic because
he talked about original sin,
confession, and I don't know, I just wrote
it down, I didn't know what else to do.
- Did he ask for a priest?
- No.
Good anything else?
Yeah, he sounded like...
the way he was talking
sounded like he's not afraid to die.
Yeah well, it's early yet.
Calls coming through, uh...
Yes, sir, right here. You
hit the blue button here
you can reach him and
it'll come back to you.
You mind if I take your seat?
- No, no, go ahead!
- Thank you, Walter.
this one here is six lines you
don't have to press that one.
- that one goes around the whole room.
- Okay.
- Why don't you, uh...
- Just hit the talk here and, uh...
Walter, remove the rest of
the day off, get out of here.
I thought, I'll stick around
here... Make sure that...
That wasn't a suggestion.
So, why don't you go home?
Can I take a piss?
- So who's stopping you?
- alright,
I don't want to end up on
any amnesty international list, so
step up to the door, face out.
Open the middle door.
Do what you gotta do.
Can I jump down, there?
- You gotta go, or don't you??
- I do, I gotta go!
Step up my, man!
Lets go! Lets go!
That kids going places.
Alright close the doors!
Alright, everybody sit down!
Who is this?
This is, Lieutenant Camonetti, I'm with
the, NYPD hostage negotiation team.
I'd like to talk to you
about this situation that we're in.
Where the fuck is, Garber?
Mr. Garber is a train dispatcher
this, then this is now a police matter...
I want to talk to, Garber!
I'm sorry, Mr Ryder, but Mr
Garber is no longer involved.
Stand!
Put, Garber on the line!
To be honest, Mr Garber has gone home.
Put, Garber on the fucking
line, or I kill the motorman!
I guarantee you, Mr. Ryder... that
I am the best person for you to be
talking to right now, just give me
a moment and I'l explain why.
I always knew you were going
to be the first one to go.
Mr. Camonetti, youv'e got 60
fucking seconds before I kill another.
Okay? 59... 58...
Get, Garber!
- 56... 55...
- We are trying to locate...
Mr Garber, ASAP, Mr. Ryder.
Why did you do that, ?
Mr. Camonetti, or whatever fucking
grease ball name you got...
the city of fucking new york
killed Mr. Jerry, okay?
Garber! Garber!
Come, come quick he...
he killed, Jerry Pollard, man.
Come on, he wants to
talk to you right now!
He's here! He's on the way!
- 8... 7...
- He's approaching the desk!
Hey it's me! It's, Garber!
Garber!
You didn't say goodbye!
- You killed, Jerry.
- The city of fucking new york killed, Jerry okay?
The biggest rat-hole in
the world fucking killed, Jerry!
Okay? Now you can chuck
another victim up to, NYC.
- Now can everybody hear me?
- Yeah we here you, loud and clear.
Well good, now you don't
have to tell the cops
they don't tell me how to do it, or how
it's going to be! I'll fucking tell them.
Don't you ever, ever leave me again,
or, I'll hunt you down and I'll kill you!
Now,
you got 39.
ESU 2. What's your position?
ESU 2: we're approaching hostage
car from the south tunnel.
Go, go, go!
$10 million! Let's just write him
a check and get it over with.
- He wants it in cash.
- I was joking, LaSalle.
We've been given 1 hour
to get the money together.
$10 million! Where do
they get these numbers?
Actually ten's the limit, Sir.
- Why is that?
- We just sign a request to the city control
he forges it to one of our lenders, cash get's released to
the federal reserve. Limit at any one time, is 10 million.
Well some idiot with a gun wouldn't
know that. I didn't know that.
- Well you're very busy, sir.
- How do you know that?
Here he is.
- Henry, what's the situation?
- They just killed a hostage.
Bitch of a way to find out, but
these guys may be the real deal.
Guys? I thought it was one
idiot with a gun, who are...?
Multiple gunmen. We don't know, they're
not sure. They got 18 hostages they say
they'll kill more in an hour, that's
the time limit. They want you to know.
- What do we know about them?
- They're not amateurs... They cut out a car
stopped a rise in the tunnel, they can see
us coming a 100 yards either way.
How long to get the money together.
I don't know.
- Find out.
- Your not thinking of paying these, pricks are you?
I'm thinking of buying time and being ready.
Call the controller,
tell him we'll pay them.
What's with you and, Garber,
huh? Tell me about him.
- Was he scheduled to work today?
- Yeah, absolutely.
But...
- But what?
- He's only had this particular job, a couple of weeks.
- Why is that?
- He's under investigation.
- What?
- We're gonna suspend him, with pay...
What's he being investigated for?
We went to, Japan, he had a look at some
trains and the allegation is that he took a bribe.
- Took a bribe. does he have a previous record?
- No. Not that I know of.
- Your sure of that.
- Yeah, I don't think so. I gotta take this.
The identity of the
hijackers is still unclear
the hostage negotiating team has
just arrived at the, MTA headquarters
to determine if this
is a terrorist enterprise
Is that what we are? an enterprise?
We're an enterprise!
Well, our little enterprise
has begun it's descent.
ESU 4, what's your, ETA?
Approximately two minutes from the target.
Why's the train called, Pelham 1-2-3?
It comes at, Pelham Bay
at 1:23 in the afternoon.
How did you end up with this call?
It's a lexington avenue train
and I got the lexington avenue
desk. It came through my desk.
Can you think of any reason,
why you would be targeted?
someone would wanna hurt you?
Something against you or something.
No.
Yoy recognize the voice?
No. As I said, it was a coincidence
that it came through my desk.
Did you pick this desk, or
was it assigned to you?
Did I?
I said, did you pick this desk,
or was it assigned to you?
Can I take my coat off?
- Doesn't make any sense!
- What doesn't?
The guy your talking to,
he isn't a train dispatcher.
Walter Garber.
- He's a big shot.
- Big-shot of what?
Rail control, he runs things up there.
Atleast he did before I went out.
- His name is Walter?
- Yeah.
Dude like that shouldn't
be answering the phone?
- Mr. Ryder wants to talk to you.
- Right.
Are you sure you don't have
some sort of relationship with him?
I'm sure whatever
relationship I have with him
is better than yours.
Jerry, my friend was killed
while "you" were talking to, Ryder.
So maybe that's a question you should
be asking yourself, instead of asking me
- I didn't have anything to do with this.
- I didn't say that.
This, Mr. Garber,
is an unknown variable.
- An unknown variable?
- That's right
and peoples lives are at stake.
- I understand that.
- So, please excuse me if I
try to get more comfortable
with you, okay?
It aint working, but okay.
Alright.
Now with that in mind, would you agree
to a consensual search of your house?
It would take me 40, 45
minutes to get a warrant.
Yes, okay.
Got, em.
- Walter Garber.
- Wow
Oh shit, look at this!
He took a bribe, man.
Yeah.
Woo-hoo, baby!
ESU 2: what is your overall status?
All position's secured.
Alright, hold your fire until instructed.
Pelham 1-2-3
can you hear me?
Yeah, loud and clear, back at ya!
Alright the mayor's agreed to pay and a...
they're getting the money
together right now.
Good!
Well you know, you got 28 minutes,
so I'd advise them to make haste.
I'm sure you will.
So, is your first name, Walter?
- Excuse me?
- Your name, is it, Walter.
- Yes it is.
- good.
What are you doing dispatching trains?
I thought you were some sort of, MTA big-shot?
I worked for the, MTA, today
they put me in dispatch and uh...
- My bad luck.
- I thought you didn't believe in bad luck.
I said I didn't believe in fate.
do you believe in rig
contracts for new trains?
Look... what we talking about this for?
- I need to know who I'm dealing with.
- You need to know, who your dealing with?
Yeah, I need to know who I'm
dealing with. Are you a bad penny!
Let me explain something to you.
being accused of
something is one thing.
Be guilty of it, is
something entirely different.
I agree, but...
You gotta take me
through it my, man.
You gotta tell me from the top.
This whole train thing, come on.
Alright, I started out in a... maintenance.
platforms maintenance, track maintenance.
- Conductor.
- Conductor, really?
Yeah and then, motorman.
A motorman? How long
did you do that for?
I drove them over 6 years, I went
to operations, assistant dispatcher
- dispatcher, I finally ended up...
- Yeah, your assistant, chief transportation officer or
something, right?
That's right.
And part of my job is to a...
go out to the manufacturers, you know people
who build the trains and bid on contracts for the trains.
Is that where you took your
bribe, the Japanese train...
- or the, Canadian train?
- I did not take a bribe, alright?
I was accused of taking a bribe,
I have not been proven guilty yet.
Well they haven’t said yet, I
mean they haven't decided yet.
They got no proof. I don't
care what they decide.
- It don't matter what...!
- Is this when they demoted you?
That's correct, they demoted
me pending the outcome.
And now, they tying to
humiliate you, is that, right?

best train and I made my recommendation.
Before you took the bribe?
Yes.
That was a train you were
going to pick anyway, huh?
Yes.
Now your fighting for your job and

Look, what has this got
to do with anything, huh?
What did you fucking spend it on?
I used the money

To pay my childrens tuition.
I have a 17 year old and a 19 year old,
and I used the money to pay
for their college tuition, alright.
You know, Garber...

Yes, but at least
it's honest work.

It would take like 3 thousand years to
pay off that, that suit that your wearing.

You don't get that without
screwing someone.
or screwed everyone, I'm sure your

- Yeah I do have a deal. I wanna make you a deal.
I want to tell you, you
can come down here,
and I will trade you for all
these passangers in the train, how's that?
Okay? You can save the life of 17
new yorkers, that's a good deal.
What do you think?
- Give us a moment.
- Okay.
I give you a moment.
If you turn this into a circus, you're
going to get somebody else killed.
If you enter he's
world, exit it.
Okay, time's up. What's the deal?
It's a very nice offer but, I'm
afraid I'm going to have to decline.
Oh good, beacause you were begging I
wouldn't give you that deal, man!
You think anyone cares about
a pal brine asshole like you?
the city of new york would love for
me to pull the fucking trigger on you, brother!
Hey, Garber, man this is the dude

to get rid of you my, man?
- Keep talking to him.

appearances he's piss has been clean...
But he was a no show at work

He knows the system,

subway to stop the train.
He's only been out a month. This
wasn't planned in the last three weeks.
Find out who, Ramos' cell-mates were,
who worked in the laundry with him.
Call list, visitor's list, ASAP.
The market has tumbled nearly 7%,
as the investors continue to react to the events...
They just came of the bridge.
Why didn't we send a
helicopter for the money?
Walter, now remember what I said
about talking through deadlines, right?
We gotta have a plan B in case
the money isn't here on the dot.
Put him back on he's heels. He knows
things, we know things too, right?
- Right.
- Ask him about, Phil Ramos.
Just get him talking.
You can do it.
Hey, Ryder?
- The money here yet?
- On the way.
So what the fuck, you calling me for?
Actually, I just called to talk.
Oh yeah? What do
you want to talk about?
You said that a...
being in the motormans cab that
was like being in a confessional, right?
Yeah.
I was thinking, maybe it's a little
like being in a prison cell too.
What you trying to say? That If I
get caught, I better get used to it?
No, I'm just wondering...
maybe your already used to it...
I'm wondering maybe...
That's how you meet a
guy like, Phil Ramos.
How the fuck does he know that!
Why don't you tell me, Garber? Then,
we'll both know. After today's confession,
your going to find
your ass in prison too.!
Which is my point.
I want you to hook
me up on the inside,
I know you know everybody, this way
when I come up with my own heist plan,
you know I'll cut you in.
I can see I've inspired you.
Okay I've got a story for you.
It might help you in prison. you
Wanna hear it? We got a minute?
Yeah, I'd like to hear a little story.
Alrighty so back in the day,
when I was a high roller.
When were you ever a high roller?
Well you know, I told you I fed the
city breakfast every morning.
- Bacon and eggs?
- Or something like that.
Well anyway back in the day,
I took this chick to, Iceland.
Iceland? Is that where
all the high rollers go?
Iceland is 6 hours from, Canada.
The night-club scene is intense, and
I thought I'd take this chick to iceland.
- What's her name?
- Lavicta, she was, Lithuanian.
She was an ass model.
She asked what?
You heard of hand models,
right, for advertisements.
She was an ass model.
She did jeans and magazines and shit.
Anyway, it was a fashion
week in new york and a...
I took her to, Iceland.
Lavicta, Lithuania, ass model,
Iceland. You took her to the ice.
For $500, they take you on a
dogs-sledge ride in the glaciers.
- Dogs sleigh?
- Yeah.
And you know the whole saying, if your
not the lead dog, the view never changes?
Right, otherwise your always looking
at the asshole of the dog in front of you.
That would be funny
if I get to that part.
It's funny now.
And it's 8 in the morning and
we haven't been to bed yet.
And it was 2 when we crossed
this glacier and I got this hangover
that's creeping up the back of my neck...
and guess what I'm looking at?
Your obviously, you're staring at the ass
of the dog in front of you.
You got it!
so this dog, out of know where just lifts it's
hind legs up and puts them in the harness
and just takes a shit, whilst it's
running on it's front paw.
so he's dumping and running,
all at the same time
now that's multi fucking
tasking if you ask me.
Get outta here. Did it hit you?
Shit always hit's you, man!
I didn't know at the time,
but it was profound!
- Profound?
- Yeah.
You lost me.
You know, when I went to
prison, later on, which you called.
I had trouble going to the
toilet, you know... privacy thing.
and I...
I couldn't take a shit,
I was scared shitless, literally.
- So, you know what I thought of?
- You thought of the dog!
That's right. I thought if that dog.
could do what it needed
to do, so could I.
Saved my fucking life!
Wow, that is profound.
And you know it's... it's...
People adapt
It's like you and I,
like today, we didn't know
how today was going to start.
- Wrong!
- Wrong what?
I knew exactly how it was going to start.
Yeah but, do you know
how it's going to end?
I'm tired of talking you, Garber.
- No wait...
- Call me when the money comes in.
You got 4 minutes.
I don't know what he looks
like, but he sounds good.
Fucking talk's shit?
He's got a sexy voice, man

- Where are we?
- Less than 10 blocks away.
Shit. Captain, the money

motorcycle and get it there.
You got 22 seconds, Garber.
- Alright, we just had a little problem over here, that's all...
- I don't care!
Two minutes.
- Tell him it's here, how the hell's he gonna know?
- I don't think I should lie.
Tell him the truth
Tell him the truth?
He's going to make me do it.

- Get the lady up, come on up, up!
- I think that's him.
Ryder, listen to me! We
made a mistake, it's my fault!
- The cars hit, that's why the...
- Tell him something.
- Up, up!
- Get up!
Get back in line!
Ryder, one minute it's going to take.
Don't do this, for God's sake!
It was an accident!
- Wait!
- It's the only plan I've got!
Ryder, listen!
It was an accident!
It was an accident, Ryder!
We made a mistake.
It was an accident, Ryder!
Come on, mother fucker!
God!
ESU, Team 1, to sniper 1:
Do you have a shot?
That's your fault!
Got an easy shot, please advise.
- Stand by.
- Roger that.
What the fuck happened?
Accidental discharge.
Just got bit by a fucking, rat!
It's accidental discharge.
Who, who go shot?
Was it, Ryder?
No, it was, Ramos.
- Sergeant, the money there yet?
- Yes, yes.
Ryder, are you there?
Shoot any mother fucker that moves!
- It's an order!
- Shove your orders!
Can you hear me, Ryder?
Okay, now somebody else has to die!
Two people, maybe all of us!
Did you hear me?
I heard you, but you got to understand.
The circumstances, they're
different now for you.
You gotta re-think this, you gotta adapt.
No, I gave instructions and
you know the consequences!
Don't you have a plan, B?
No! The plan "B" was
enforcing plan "A"!
The minute you stop believing
me, mother fucker!
- That's it!
- I believe you, but...
you gotta believe, and understand that those cops are
gonna be down that tunnel and next to you any second...
Bring it, man! Let them
come, I don't care!
What's the point of that,
huh? What's the point of that.
I told you, we all owe god a death.
and now it's 2 minutes past the deadline.
have to go. They have to die.
The money's there, Ryder.
Nobody else has to die.
I don't know what you owe god, but
I can tell you, you can't pay him in cash.
You never see a U horn behind a
hearse, Ryder the, Egyptians tried it,
it doesn't work, you can't
take the money with you.
Ryder?
You can't take the money with you!
All this talk of, god...
I think I need to pray.
Give me a minute.
I can do that.
You did good, Walter.
What's the reality of getting
in there and ending this?
We have to except heavy casualties
on all sides, it's a hard choice.
- but I say make it!
- New york city, does not have an acceptable casualty rate.
Now this is your area of expertise,
- what do you suggest?
- I think we should by time.
so far the son-of-a-bitch
hasn't allowed us to do
that, but this might be the first
time we got through to him.
Chester man here, just confessed
to a felony, 20 minutes ago.
In my opinion, there are people down
there who are alive because of him.
Until we change the
rules or hope runs out,
we should stick with the
situation we have now.
Do what you need to do.
Hey, Garber,. You there?
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Speak up.
I'm here.
- I talked to, god.
- That's good! What did he say.
He said I should trust in him
all others pay cash, how soon
can you get it down here.
From the next station, it would take
them about 5 minutes to walk it down.
No, no, no! I mean you, man.
How long would it take you,
to come down here?
I don't understand.
What do you mean, me?
I mean "you". I want to
meet you, Garber.
If you bring it, I know the
cops aren't bringing it.
Well, you know...
I don't know how I'm going to carry
that money, I mean it must weigh.
fucking wheel barrow or something.
Why we discussing weight? Shouldn't
you be thinking get the fuck outta there?
- Okay, get the fuck outta there!
- Good! That's progress!
Now look, plan B, your idea...
and part of plan, B is you,
Garber, deliver that money!
Or I kill another hostage, you got that?
You got seven minutes, buddy boy.
You got 6 minutes and
Do it!
- Check.
- And tell that sleeze bag negotiator
to call me when you got the money.
You don't have to do this.
Finally somebody got
their head out of their ass.
Hello?
Hey, how you doing baby?
What are you doing?
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm watching the thing. The hostages.
They mentioned you I think, they said
a dispatcher was talking to the terrorist.

Where are you?
I'm at a, a... heliport.
I'm getting ready to get on the helicopter, they
want me to take the money down to the tunnel.
What?
Are they crazy?
It's real simple, there's nothing to it.
What it is, is he know's
I'm not a cop so he
wants me to come down...
Is it okay if I wait here?
Can I wait here?
They need me to take the money down
there because they know I'm not a cop.
and a...
You know, they saying
they might kill somebody.
Well then somebody has to die.
Because you can't.
Let it out!
I understand, baby!
Listen to me! Listen to me

You can see what your fighting for.
I love you so much!
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
Would you love me back?
I can't really talk right now.
All you have to say is, "yes."
It's alot less than saying, I can't talk.

Is this the part where you try to get through
to me? I don't think so mother fucker!
I got 3 instructions for you:
Number 1: When this conversation is over, I
want you to restore the power to the hull sector.
Number 2:
I want you to clear the local track's from
and when I say clear,
I don't wanna see no cops.
I want all the lights green and don't trip

Don't worry about it.
Just don't fuck it up.
We got an, ID on, Ryder.
Dennis Ford. He was released
from, corrections 2 weeks ago.
Did a 9 year stretch, the last 4 in
the same cell block as, Phil Ramos.
He's name shows up on an, Icelandic
air passengers list in, september of 1998
right after fashion week.
Dennis Ford! You remember?
We used he's case when he
was running as an example...
The kind of nonsense we would clean
up, if I ever get elected, mayor, yeah..
He ran a private equity firm...
he's biggest client was
the city pension fund,
Sifendorff.
bargain for 3, judge gave him 10.
Maybe that's why he's so pissed off!
The judge gave him 10 years because
we didn't recover all of the city's money.
There was a couple of million
unaccounted for, it was the siege money.
- Siege money? For what?
For today. He played the terrorist card.
You panic the market into a drop.
If you know what's coming, you can make
a great deal of money with 2 million dollars.
What about the hostage money?
Are you kidding, that's nothing compared
to the money you can make in the market.
Let's get down town, get to
the, SCC. Check the trades.
We got company.
Garber!
When you put your socks on
this morning, did you ever think...
Turn around, let him frisk you?
I was worried about you...
I thought maybe you'll get lost, then I
remembered, you were a motorman so...
These tunnels don't
change much, do they?
Just the people in them.
We good?
- Looks, good.
- Alright, come on up!
Let's go!
Damn, your taller than
I thought you'd be.
Your good looking too,
come on. Sit down.
It's nice to meet you.
What do you weigh, about, 220?
Err...Yeah, I'm a, 220 on a good day.
Ah, that's, Ramos.
He's what you would have called,
the "brains of the operation."
Dumb fuck.
So how long has it been, since
you've driven one of these?
That's why you, brought me down here?
Well your a motorman,
right? once a motorman
always a motarman..
Play your cards right, you
might get part of the cut.
What the fuck?
This is a... new train, I'm not
certified on a new train.
But I've got "faith" in you, man.
Let me ask you one question.
You know, that saying, when you
told your wife about the 35k...
how did she react?
- Look, we gotta talk about it?
- Don't be sensitive.
- I'm not being sensitive?
- Did she freak out or what?
She wasn't happy,
but she understood.
- Well that's love, right?
- No, that's marriage...
that's another thing.
So what's the deal? you think
they're going to move the train?
Seems like a possibility...
How we covered
with street level exits
and emergency exits?
I got a blanket on the fuckers!
I got radios cars, manned on every exit...
from 42nd to, south ferry.
We got to go.
Hey, Camonetti!
Fucking grease ball, man.
Hey, grease ball, speak up!
I see red, I don't see green.
What's taking so fucking long?
The blanket is not tucked in yet. You have
to stall, I need 2 minutes, buy me two minutes.
They haven't cleared the tracks yet.
Mr. Ryder will be up and
ready in less than two minutes.
Okay, we're going to
move forward here, okay!
we're going to move forward
and if we get on to a red signal...
and the brakes trip up,
your friend, Walter Garber's
getting it in the head...
- You got it?
- Yes sir, I got it.
Let's roll, let's roll.
- You are bluffing.
- Yeah, I'm bluffing, man.
You got to say what you got to say.
You thought by coming down here,
you'd be redeemed didn't you?
God bless, Garber.
You're more fucked up than I am.
The least the same fucked up.
Come on. Let's go
Let's go, let's go...
Let's go!
She's on the move.
Put some speed on it.
You're playing with fire, my man.
I want to see them green.
Change them to green or I'll put a hole
in, Garber's head right now. Do it!
Believe me, we are
moving as fast as we can.
What happens if they run a red light?
It will trip the brakes.
Coming up on the first one.
Yeah! That's what I'm looking for.
That's what I'm looking for.
Here he comes right now.
Your man, Garber is driving the
train. The sniper confirmed.
So what are you saying, he's
in on it! There is no fucking way.
The sniper killed, Ramos
he was their driver... so
they probably need, Garber to drive.
When they get to, coney island...
they gonna hit the trip and the
brakes are gonna come on.
- Was that a 33rd?
- Yes, sir.
How far to the signal?
- About a tenth of a mile.
- Stop when you get there.
we're moving out? You got that.
Slowing down now.
Are they slowing down?
They have to, they're coming
up to the signal point.
What is that?
You're the old motorman. You tell me.
- They stopped just below 33rd street!
- What the hell are they doing?
- Why that little stop.
- Train has to stop at signal points.
- Some kind of an override?
- Yeah, yeah...
some kind of an override. That's right.
Here we go, Okay lets
move out. Let's go! Let's go!
Now's the time of running. Which way?
Which way?
She's moving again.
Next stop 28th Street.
- Why that little stop, huh?
- I told you, signal the points.
How do you know they didn't
set the throttle and jump out?
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter,
we've got every exit covered.
There's no where to go.
Listen, the throttle can't be
set, it has to be held...
It's a fail safe, It's a dead mans switch.
If it doesn't have a man's
hand pressing down on it,
the train stops cold. Believe me
they're still on board.
It's going faster.
Emri, up the tracks, come on!
Let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
It's going to derail before
it get's to, coney island.
That's it! That's it! Exit right
there in front of you!
The fucking train will
pass, cross over now!
- What?
- Come on, move!
Hey!
Fuck it! Let's go!
- We need to find him!
- We don't have time. Let's go!
- I love you. I fucking love you!
- I fucking love you too!
Hello. Hello.
I'm getting calls...
Cops are seeing passangers on the train.
nobody's in the motorman's booth.
Believe me they're still on board.
Okay. It's alright.
as soon as we pass through the red light
the brakes will stop us automatically.
Yeah, but they're all green!
Four stops away.
Two stops.
- Oh, Jesus.
- The train just stopped.
I really have to go take a piss.
There's no hijackers on
board. Just passengers.
Where was that stop, that
first stop that they made?
Down the 33rd.
- That's where the, roosevelt was built.
- The what?
a derelict tunnel, built
under the, Waldorf hotel.
converse everything on that area.
I want a goddamn parade over it!
Hey!
Let's stay calm.
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Get out, get out! get out!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Get out of the way!
Go, go, go!
- 911, operator.
- Hello, hello!
- Here is Walter Garber MTA.
- How do you spell that?
Gar... don't worry about how to
spell it, Just tell, Lieutenant Camonetti...
that, Ryder is headed to
the, manhattan bridge.
Hey, hey!
- Is he in there?
- No, no, no.
- So, where did he go?
- Brooklyn.
He said he couldn't
Wait. He started walking.
Fucking city!
Ryder!
Don't move!
So is this how you thought
the day was gonna end, huh?
When you put your
socks on this morning, huh?
This make you
feel better, Garber?
- That make everything, okay now?
- No!
But it's a start.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Hey!
Garber, baby boy.
I ain't going back to prison.
I don't think you got any
options now or leverage.
Hey, hey!
We all owe god a death, I told you that.
You're wrong, we owe, god life.
Life and that's the life I
gave you back today.
and now you have to
give me something back.
What are you talking about?
You got a gun in your hand,
I want you to use it.
Shoot me. No! Shoot me before
they shoot me or I'm gonna kill you.
I will shoot you,
I don't want to, but I will.
- Hey!
- Thought you cared?
- No.
- You said, Ryder...
Don't you have anyone that cares?
I thought that was you?
- Come on man!
- I'm not going to shoot you.
Alright, I'll give you to ten,
then the deals off.
I've got a gun. I'm going to use it.
I'm going to take your life back.
- Hey!
- Come on, man!
Okay, you want
reach zero?
Come on, motherfucker!
Shoot me!
I am not going to shoot you!
- Come on!
- Hey!
Police. Drop your weapon!
- I'm disappointed in you.
- 2...
You're my goddamn hero.
Drop your weapon!
Mr. Garber?!
- Intresting day, huh?
- Yes, sir.
Just about every day I make a speech...
and a... it start's with:
I'd like to thank you on behalf of the
city of, new york, blah, blah, blah...
and I never know what
I'm thinking or why.
But you...
did a hell of a thing today. You
went to bat for the city of, new york
and on behalf of me,
I'd like to thank you.
Your welcome, I mean,
It's been an amazing day, everyone's
been thanking me all day, but I...
appreciate it. You're welcome.
I want you to know...
that tomorrow the city of, new
york is going to go to bat, for you.
- In a big way. You understand?
- Yes, sir.
And the city has a very
good batting average.
- Appreciate it.
- Alright.
I'm going to get home.
Well take my car.
- No, I think...
- Put the siren on and everything.
- Nah... You got the siren on there?
- Yes!
No, I'll take the subway. But I appreciate it.
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.
You know, me, subway all my life.
I get home faster than you anyway.
I mean not you but everybody
else. But thank you, sir,

No,... Well, yes! Yes, of course.
