WHITMORE: Perhaps it's fate
that today
is the Fourth of July.
You will once again
be fighting for our freedom...
Not from tyranny,
oppression, or persecution...
but from annihilation.
We're fighting
for our right to live.
We're fighting
for our right to live.
The world declared
in one voice
we will not go quietly
into the night.
We will not vanish
without a fight.
We're going to live on.
We're going to survive.
Today, we celebrate our...
LANFORD ON SPEAKERS:
The countless lives
that we lost
in the war of '96...
did not perish in vain.
They inspired us
to rise from the ashes...
as one people of one world.
For 20 years, the world
has seen no armed conflict.
Nations have put
their petty differences aside.
United,
we rebuilt our families,
our cities and our lives.
The fusion of human and alien
technology...
not only enabled us
to defy gravity
and travel
with unimaginable speed...
it also made our planet,
finally, safe again.
Great speech, Patty.
Thank you,
Madam President.
One moment.
We're ready
for you, sir.
Captain Hiller.
Welcome
to the White House.
It's great to be back.
I cannot tell you
how proud we are
to have you
flying our flag up there.
It's an honor,
Madam President.
Your father
was a great man.
He'd be so proud.
I think you know the
Secretary of Defense.
Sir.
Nice to see
you again, son.
I know I don't have to
introduce you two.
MAN: Ma'am, let's get you
touched up for photo.
Moving up in the world.
Says America's knight
in shining armor.
Oh, you're the one that's
back in the White House.
Yeah, as an employee
I don't quite get
the same benefits
as when I lived here.
Captain.
Yeah?
We're ready for you.
Thank you.
Dylan...
be nice to Jake when
you see him up there.
WOMAN ON RADIO: Moon-Tug-Ten,
confirm position.
Seven miles and closing.
The slowest trip
of my life.
CHARLIE: Hey, cheer up.
There's worse things
that you could be doing...
than towing a half
trillion dollar weapon.
Yeah, well, I need
a little more stimulation.
Hey, you know?
I didn't have to
follow you up here.
Yeah, you did.
You get lonely without me.
I was
the youngest valedictorian
in the history
of the academy.
I could have been
stationed anywhere.
Like San Diego, you know?
Beaches, surfing.
You never surfed
a day in your life.
But I'm a fast learner.
And I got great balance.
Like a cat.
Ah, cats hate water,
Charlie.
Four percent. Reverse thrust.
WOMAN: Roger, Tug-Ten.
Reversing thrust,
four percent.
MAN: The tugs and the weapon
are on final approach.
They're in position,
sir.
WOMAN:
Docking in three, two...
one.
Initiate uncoupling
sequence.
WOMAN: All tugs disengage.
CHARLIE: Do you realize
that there are only 36 women
on this Moon Base?
I'm sure one of them will
eventually come around, pal.
You know, it's not like
they all rejected me.
I happen to have standards.
Whoa! What did you do?
Nothing!
That didn't sound
like nothing.
Tug-Ten collided
with the weapon.
The clamps have stopped.
They're not
responding, sir.
All tugs,
take evasive action.
Pull back! Pull back!
Charlie! It's gonna
crush the base!
JIANG: I said pull back!
That's a negative, sir.
CHARLIE:
This isn't a fighter, Jake.
JAKE: Don't remind me!
Lt. Miller...
what are you idiots doing?
CHARLIE: I don't know, sir!
We're gonna die!
This is how I die!
WOMAN:
Sir, he's slowing the fall.
JAKE: Go to your happy place.
I'm kicking in
the fusion drive.
Are you crazy? We'll burn up!
Yeah, that's very possible!
Come on!
Yes!
Yes!
It's actually working!
I honestly didn't think
that was gonna work.
CHARLIE: Oh, shit!
Jiang's coming in hot
and he's got that look.
He knows we don't speak
Chinese, right?
Whoo!
That was a close call, sir.
You almost
got us all killed.
Ah, yeah...
but then I saved everyone.
You don't get credit for
cleaning up your own mess.
And you destroyed
one of my tugs.
Uh, actually, sir,
if anybody's to blame...
Sir, I lost my focus.
It won't happen again.
No, it won't.
You're grounded
until further notice.
Can I still watch TV or...
You didn't have to
take the fall.
Yeah, well...
He already hates me.
Why break tradition?
MAN ON RADIO:
Transport 103-ARP-1.
General Adams,
we are being directed
to Alien Prison, Platform 1.
General.
This better be good.
My wife and I were enjoying
a very nice morning...
in a very expensive
bed and breakfast.
I'm sorry, sir.
I thought you should see this.
BOTH: Sir.
It started
a couple of hours ago.
Look how
their behavior changed.
ADAMS: After 20 years
of being catatonic.
Get me Director
Levinson.
We tried.
He's unreachable, sir.
ROSENBERG:
You need to take me seriously.
I've been chasing you
across the planet
for three weeks now.
But now that I have you...
Excuse me,
who are you again?
Floyd Rosenberg.
Government appointed
controller.
MAN ON RADIO:
Please be advised.
Entering hostile territories.
We should slow down.
We don't wanna look like
we're posing a threat.
Now, we're gonna start
with Appendix 2.
I know a lot of people have
a negative reaction
to being audited.
But I've found it's
a constructive experience.
Lloyd. Lloyd, Lloyd.
It's Floyd.
We have to meet
a friend right now,
a great guy.
Come say hi.
ROSENBERG: Where are we?
Director Levinson.
Who are those men?
It's Umbutu's
rebel forces.
The warlord?
I don't think there's
anything to worry about.
His old man just died
and I hear that the son
is much more of a moderate.
Uh, hey, fellas...
howdy doody. Say, um...
I'm looking for
Dikembe Umbutu.
I see you found
their armory.
The one and only,
David Levinson.
Catherine, wow!
What are you doing here?
You don't think
you're the only expert
he called, do you?
I'm so surprised to see you,
a little bit.
I'm a little surprised
that you remember my name.
Hey, hey, come on.
Let's be professional.
Well, we both remember
what happened
the last time we tried
to be professional.
I'm sensing
a palpable tension here.
We've bumped into each other
at a few conferences.
I bet you have.
Shut up, Floyd.
ROSENBERG:
Director Levinson, I'm sorry.
We're not done
our business here.
What papers?
Uh, it looks like this.
Um...
So, why does Umbutu Junior
need a psychiatrist?
Unresolved daddy issues?
His people fought a ground war
with the aliens for 10 years.
Their connection is
the strongest I've ever seen.
It's as if their
mind is...
tapped into
the alien subconscious.
Yeah.
Your obsession with
the human-alien
psychic residual
condition.
Yeah, you calling me
obsessive. That's cute.
How did they get
the lights on?
We didn't.
It happened on its own.
Two days ago.
DAVID: Of course,
you're aware that this is
the only ship
that landed in '96.
And so, I appreciate
you finally granting us
this access, Mr. Umbutu.
Your father
was very tenacious.
His pride caused
the death
of more than
half of my people...
including my brother.
DAVID: I'm so sorry.
Be careful!
Whoa!
Wow!
CATHERINE: What happened here?
DIKEMBE: They were drilling.
For what?
Man, I don't know.
When did
the drilling stop?
When you blew up
the Mothership.
Right now, for us,
any way to get up there?
You're not afraid
of heights, are you?
How high is it?
Oh, my God!
That's that same pattern.
So the signal
was coming from this ship.
when we destroyed
the Mothership
we detected a burst...
in an X-band frequency...
directed toward deep space.
Oh.
WHITMORE:
Today is the Fourth of July.
The distress call.
Today is the Fourth of July.
Looks like someone picked up
the phone and answered.
JAKE: I'm going crazy up here.
I can't take it anymore.
Tell me how much you miss me.
PATRICIA: Actually,
the Chief of Staff
just got a really
handsome intern.
Not quite as tall as you,
but has great dimples...
and plays the cello.
Mmm. You know
how much I miss you.
You know what?
I'm gonna steal a tug
and come back
and see you right now.
No.
Please don't.
Because last time
you did that
they added a month
to your tour.
Come on. Tell me that wasn't
the best two minutes
of your life.
Yes.
Yes, but I would like my
fiancé back permanently.
What was that?
Ah, we've been getting
these power surges
the last couple days.
You take a look
at the houses I sent you?
No, I haven't yet.
It's okay. There's no rush.
I saw Dylan
at the White House today.
I just think you two
need to have a conversation.
So he's shaking hands
with the president
and I'm stuck on the Moon.
That must be nice.
You nearly killed him,
remember?
Give him
a little credit, Jake.
P?
FEMALE VOICE:
Thank you for using QQ.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen...
please welcome
the International
Legacy Squadron.
MALE REPORTER:
Captain Hiller,
considering he died
during a test flight...
how do you feel
taking off for the Moon
from a hangar
named after your father?
He would have loved it.
It's too bad
he's not here to see it.
FEMALE REPORTER: Captain Lao,
China has been integral
to the Earth
Space Defense Program.
Is there anything you want to
say to the folks back home?
I didn't want to text you.
I wanted to hear your voice.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
My boy making a name
for himself.
Are you gonna be okay, Ma?
Just tell me
you'll be careful up there.
DYLAN: Moon Base,
this is Legacy Squadron.
We're on final approach,
requesting permission to land.
JIANG: Permission granted.
Welcome to the Moon, Captain.
Just keep it cool.
Just don't hit him. It's easy.
JIANG: Do I get
an autograph, too?
Back to work.
Uncle Jiang!
You look more and more
like your mother.
There is nothing a girl wants
to hear more than that.
FEMALE VOICE:
Mengniu Moon Milk.
I've been looking
all over for you.
I've got good news.
Yeah?
That pilot that China sent...
is my future wife
and I mean it.
I think my heart exploded.
It's like our souls
were communing.
He just walked in,
didn't he?
Yeah, he did.
Okay.
You're not gonna
finish this?
You mind moving?
We both know what happens
when you get in my way.
Oh.
I waited a long time
to do that.
Morrison!
What's going on here?
I asked you
a question.
Yes, uh, sir,
the floor is very slippery.
Be careful if I were you.
Great to see you, Dylan.
I was so close to
punching him back.
I think you made
the right choice.
You did almost kill him...
but that's why
they have ejection seats.
No, I went too far.
It's the only way I thought
I could stand out.
It was never gonna be you
leading that squadron.
That's not the way
the world works.
You know? He's royalty.
We're just orphans.
The last thing I said to my
parents was I hated them.
The only reason
I'm still alive...
is because they dropped me
off at that stupid camp.
Well, I'm glad they did.
Because you're
the only family I got.
MAN ON TABLET:
All right, final training hop.
Winner leads
the Legacy Squadron.
DYLAN: Why don't you just
give up, Morrison?
Second place will just
have to be good enough.
JAKE: Yeah, we'll see
about that, Captain Hiller.
Passing on the left.
DYLAN:
Hey, there's not enough room.
Damn it, Jake.
You're gonna clip my wing.
Control, I'm going down.
Ejecting! Ejecting!
WOMAN ON PA: Dr. O'Brien,
please report
to the surgical theater.
Good morning, Brakish.
How are we today?
I brought you
a new one.
Dactylorhiza maculata...
or the spotted orchid.
And when it fully blooms,
the lavender...
It's going to
take your breath away.
Can you believe it?
You've been in a coma
for 7300 days.
I made you a gift.
I took a knitting class.
Is it itchy?
You'd tell me
if it was itchy, right?
Oh, God.
You're awake!
Did we win?
Eric, bring in the medical team.
He's awake!
Where's my glasses?
I can't see.
Oh, they're right here.
Oh, yeah.
How long was I out?
Long time, baby.
Long time.
Oh, yeah. I can see that.
Babe...
you got a bit fat.
And really bald.
But you still look great.
RITTER: This just
came in from Hubble.
There's some kind of force
pulling at Saturn's rings.
ADAMS: Holy Christ!
What about
our defense base there?
It's gone.
And it's not just
the base.
It's like the whole moon
just vanished.
Up the alert level
to red.
Right away.
Hey, honey.
Listen, I want you to
pack up your stuff
and go to your sister's
right now.
Whoa. But this symbol
comes up more often...
than anything
I've encountered.
Look at the similarities.
How can you not see
the relevance?
No, it's not that
I don't see it.
I just feel like right
now, there are more
pressing matters
than analyzing doodles.
Like a giant space ship
turning back on.
Sir.
Yeah?
We've lost all contact
with Saturn.
What?
We need to notify
the president.
COLLINS: Already tried.
Tanner said he'll get back
to us after the press tour.
Bypass Tanner
however you can.
We need to talk
to Lanford now.
Right.
Thank you.
At least your father
spared the elephants.
Good for him.
Look.
The Roswell crash in '47.
The farmer who made contact
drew the same circle.
And every time
I interview
one of my patients
and show them this...
they all express
the same emotion.
Fear.
I don't think
it's a circle.
The night the ship
turned on...
I experienced the strongest
vision I've ever had.
And I drew this.
That's incredible.
How did you decipher
so much of their language?
They were hunting us.
We had to learn
how to hunt them.
That means you're beautiful.
JAKE: Aw, thanks, man.
Not you.
You have to remove
the sub-sonic inlets...
before you can reconfigure
the thermalized
plasma cartridges.
That's great. Why don't
you put that thing down
and help me?
CHARLIE: There she is.
Oh! It's happening.
God damn it.
The chemical reaction,
the pheromones...
all of the blood in my body,
it's rushing to my head.
Your head, huh?
I'm gonna go
introduce myself.
Yeah. No problem.
Ah! Shit!
So, you must be
the pilot China sent.
Did the giant flag
give it away?
It was that.
And the fact that I heard you
speaking Chinese earlier.
Anyway, I was wondering if
you wanted to get a drink.
Maybe fall in love.
Aren't you a little
young for that?
I'm 23 and a half.
MAN ON PA: All personnel,
report to your stations
immediately.
All personnel, report to
your stations immediately.
JIANG: Arm the primary.
Get me the Security Council.
Yes, sir.
JIANG: On screen.
COLLINS: Sir?
Yeah?
This just came in.
It was a spaceship.
MAN: Madam President.
The heads of state
are coming online.
David, are you
seeing this?
Yes, Madam President.
I'm looking right at it.
They could be
initiating an attack.
We need to strike first.
Uh, hold on. Hang on a second.
To my eye...
the design and the
technology of this ship...
is nothing like the ones
that attacked us.
I'm telling you,
this is not them.
And what if
you're wrong?
If you're wrong...
we could be starting a war
with a whole new species.
ADAMS: At this point,
we know the Saturn base
has been destroyed.
Madam President,
this could very well
be a coordinated
attack.
Get the cannon
into firing position.
Yes, sir.
CHINESE PRESIDENT ON MONITOR:
We should be cautious...
and listen to
Director Levinson.
How does the rest
of the Council feel?
Let's hold off
until we know more.
We have to be decisive.
I vote to attack.
I also vote to strike.
JIANG: Madam President...
I need an answer.
Take them out, Commander.
We are locked on.
I think this is a mistake.
Let's take another moment...
Fire!
Get me an image.
It crashed in
the Van de Graaff Crater.
We're not picking up
any signs of life.
Let's hope to God
we did the right thing.
Madam President,
we need to send
a team up to investigate
the wreckage.
We need to know
who we just shot down.
There's no sign
of life
and the threat's
been neutralized.
We can send a team up,
but David needs to be in D.C.
No. Can we not
make this political?
I need to get up there
and get answers.
David, you can lead
a team up there...
but after the
celebration.
TANNER:
You heard the president.
I'll expect to see you
next to us tomorrow
wearing your best smile.
DAVID: You want to
see my best smile?
Did he just hang up on me?
It sure sounded
that way to me, sir.
Where are you going?
Jake. I really think you
should think this through.
Okay, everyone...
get out! I'm taking off.
Wait, wait, wait!
Our tug's not
gonna fly.
That's why we're taking
Mike's tug.
Oh. Jiang is not
gonna like this.
LANFORD ON TV:
At approximately 2100 hours
Earth's Space
Defense Program...
repelled an alien attack
targeting our planet.
It wasn't them.
You can't know
that for sure.
It wasn't them.
I have to tell
the world.
Sir, it's time
for your meds.
I have to talk to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff!
Matthew, can you just
give us a second, please?
You shouldn't be wasting your
time with a crazy old man.
You gave up flying
to take care of me...
and I know how much
you loved it.
You should be with Jake.
He's on the Moon, remember?
Then you should be
with the president.
I am with the president.
They're coming back.
And this time
we won't be able to stop them.
I will avenge you, brother.
Hey, wait! I need a receipt!
COLLINS: So,
how do you know this guy?
DAVID: Oh, he's
Patricia Whitmore's fiancé.
Thank you so much.
Good job, Collins.
Yes, sir.
Someone call a cab?
Thanks for doing this, Jake.
No problem.
Let's get moving, though,
because I stole this thing.
I'm coming with you.
Um, no.
This is an ESD operation.
Strictly off limits
to all civilians...
and warlords.
I let you in.
It would be wise for you
to return the favor.
And there he goes.
Where's he going?
Oh, I'm coming, too.
Catherine!
Something is drawing
him out there...
and I'm going to
find out what.
Excuse me,
uh, Director Levinson.
Where the heck
do you think you're going?
Why don't you join us, Floyd?
Everybody else is.
Might do you some good.
No. No, no, no.
You're not
getting on that thing.
And neither am I.
We're gonna stay here
and we're gonna...
Hi.
I've never been
in a space tug before.
Is there anything
I should know?
There's a lot
you should know.
Seatbelts, obviously.
David, why don't you
take a seat.
Where? Really?
What's the matter,
are you nervous?
Uh, you know,
it's not my favorite.
Ah, don't worry.
I haven't crashed in...
a couple days.
But that was intentional.
What?
Okay, here we go.
I forgot how
much I hate this.
CHILDREN: Bye!
Mmm. Mmm.
That wasn't so bad.
I haven't kicked on
the fusion drive, yet.
Huh?
JULIUS: And in
our darkest moment...
when all hope was lost...
I said, "Never give up.
"You have to have faith."
And in that moment,
it came to me, "pow!"...
like a thunderbolt.
And that's when
I came up with the idea
that saved the world.
Yeah.
Um... Sir.
Huh?
Ah. There he is.
Welcome back.
This book is a bargain.
$9.95.
It makes a great gift
for your grandchildren.
If you're lucky enough
to have any.
Are you ready to go?
Don't rush.
Dad, you awake?
I thought we could watch the
celebration on TV together.
Matthew!
What was that?
Mmm, we're flying through
the old Mothership's
debris field.
Don't worry. These are
basically space tanks.
Space tanks? Really?
We're coming up
to the Van de Graaff crater.
There it is.
That's the crash site.
LANFORD:
Today, we are honored...
to be in the presence of some
of the brave men and women...
who defied
insurmountable odds...
and led us to victory
over alien invaders...
two decades ago.
General Grey and
his beautiful wife, Audrey.
We thank you for your
unwavering leadership.
Jeffrey.
Where the hell is Levinson?
JAKE: So,
what are we looking for?
DAVID: Well, I'm hoping
we'll know when we see it.
Is there a way of seeing
what they're seeing?
You can even talk to them.
Nice tattoos.
That's how many aliens
you killed, right?
How did you do it?
You have to get them
from behind.
DAVID:  Catherine...
I think I just found another
one of your doodles.
Charlie, tell command
to prep the lab at Area 51.
How's it looking up there,
Captain Hiller?
It's truly humbling
to see how beautiful
Earth is from here,
Madam President.
On this day, in 1996...
President Whitmore
passionately declared...
"We will not go
quietly into the night."
And we did not.
President Whitmore!
LANFORD: What a surprise!
Ladies and gentlemen...
another great war hero.
The one and only,
President Thomas Whitmore.
Please say a few words.
Today...
Not going to be...
I came to warn you.
Help me!
That is definitely bigger
than the last one.
Holy shit.
Charlie, I think you
better come and get us.
Sooner the better.
As in right now!
I'm already on it!
Everybody strap in!
It's gonna get bumpy!
JAKE: Charlie,
where the hell are you?
Just flying through
my worst nightmare!
David!
Grab my hand!
Come on, reach!
We're in! Close the ramp!
This just came in from one
of our lunar satellites.
The ship's more than
How the hell
did we miss this?
Activate all our
defense systems
and shut down the celebration.
ANNOUNCER: Attention! We have
an emergency situation!
Madam President.
Move.
Get her out of here.
Please leave the premises
in a calm and orderly fashion.
I repeat,
please leave the premises
in a calm and orderly fashion.
Gotta move!
Not without that piece!
Yeah, I thought
you were gonna say that.
Charlie,
get on the arms.
Talk to me, Charlie.
What's happening?
Damn it!
What do you mean, "damn it"?
I'm trying my best!
Stop fighting!
Just grab it!
Got it! Go, go!
There's a flying mountain
coming right for us!
Hold on!
JAKE: Oh, shit!
I'm losing speed!
Jesus, it has
its own gravity.
What does that mean?
It means
we're going for a ride.
ROSENBERG: You mean
we're stuck under this thing?
Arm the primary!
We're powered up
and locked on.
Fire!
FEMALE VOICE: Negative impact.
Negative impact.
Permission to engage.
WOMAN ON RADIO: Negative.
All fighters,
clear the blast zone.
Arm the primary
and fire again!
Above us.
Something's happening.
Sir.
Evacuate, everyone!
Go!
Rain, watch out!
All fighters, fall back!
Fall back!
Copy.
It's projected to enter
Earth's atmosphere
in 22 minutes.
If it doesn't alter
its current velocity...
it's gonna crack
the planet in half.
We're not gonna
let that happen, Tanner.
Initiate the
Orbital Defense System.
Yes, ma'am.
WOMAN ON RADIO: General Adams,
we are primed
and ready to fire.
Initiate
simultaneous countdown.
MAN ON RADIO:
Roger, Command. Syncing now.
WOMAN: Starting countdown.
Ten... Nine...
Eight... Seven... Six...
Five... Four...
Three... Two...
General...
the Asian Pacific
Defense System
went offline
before they could fire.
Yes, sir. Copy that.
Jake's alive!
He radioed us
from the Moon!
He's with Director Levinson.
They're on their way
to Area 51.
That Hercules right
there is on stand-by.
Madam President,
can you take my father
to Cheyenne Mountain?
Yes, of course.
I'm going
with you, Patty.
Dad!
You're gonna need me.
Wish us luck.
Ma'am,
we have to go.
ROSENBERG:
Director Levinson...
I'm gonna talk
to my supervisor...
and make sure you get
all the money you need.
What are those green lights?
TANNER: The ship will
touch down over the Atlantic.
Which part?
All of it, ma'am.
LANFORD: Issue an evacuation
order for every coastline.
I don't think
there's time.
So, what's the plan?
We have less than
to get every patient
out of here.
Move!
Yes, Ma'am.
We still have
two in surgery.
Get them in post-op
as fast as you can.
Absolutely.
Help, please!
I got you, honey.
I'm not gonna leave you.
What goes up, must come down.
Whoa!
Oh, we're free!
Oh, God.
Don't worry,
we're in a controlled dive.
Falling!
It's called falling!
Nope. Controlled dive.
Whoa.
Nice, nice.
Jesus.
They like to get the landmarks.
Are we dead?
We're okay.
Pee your pants?
Yeah!
Me too.
We can access
the trench through here.
Are you sure?
Mmm-hmm.
Hundred percent.
This, right here.
That's the best way in.
Yeah, I got it.
Captain, they're ordering
all ships out of the area.
There's a hundred
million dollars' worth
of gold on that ship.
They think
we're gonna leave it?
They're out of their minds.
Capitaine...
you better come
and see this.
ADAMS ON RADIO:
To all aircraft
within the sound
of my voice...
we expect the devastation
to the East Coast
to be beyond imagination.
The rally point
for all remaining aircraft...
is Area 51.
Rain, you take the lead.
I'll meet you there.
I gotta see about someone.
Good luck.
Are you okay?
My mother lives in London.
Maybe she made it out.
Yeah, maybe.
Dad, where are you?
JULIUS ON PHONE:
On my boat. Where else?
David, this one is definitely
bigger than the last one.
DAVID: You can see it?
Uh, listen to me.
You have to get to shore...
as fast as you can. Dad!
David? David!
Oh, sweet Moses.
Wait!
Wait!
We're gonna die.
No, no. Look at me.
We are not going
to die.
MAN ON RADIO: Marine 3, clear.
I got bodies
on that hospital roof
that need immediate evac.
Yes! Yes, come on!
Let's go!
Hand him the baby.
It's okay.
Okay. Please
be careful.
You're gonna be all right.
He's got her.
Get on board. Get on board.
MAN: We gotta go right now.
Good girl.
Mom!
Pull her up!
Pull her up! No!
No, Mom!
No!
Whoa! Whoa! Oh, my!
Why did I buy this boat?
Whoa! Whoa!
ADAMS: Glad to have you back,
Mr. President.
Been far too long.
Thank you.
Is David Levinson here?
Not yet.
Morrison's tug is still
Have them meet us
at the prison.
We need to
interrogate one.
What the...
They've gotten worse.
Much worse.
Mr. President?
Dr. Okun.
You're awake.
Very much so.
Why are they screaming?
No, no, no.
They're not screaming.
They're celebrating.
General,
one of the prison cells
is docking with the chamber.
Where's my dad?
I think he went
in there.
Get the weapons!
Let's go!
Let's go!
We have alien guns?
FEMALE VOICE:
Isolation chamber activated.
ADAMS: How did he get in here?
Dad, it's too dangerous!
Someone get him
out of there!
He overrode the system.
Sir, please
unlock the door!
Don't you worry
about me.
Just get as many
answers as you can.
No, don't!
Whitmore locked
himself in.
Can you hear us?
She has arrived.
Who is she?
She...
is all.
What does she want?
What does this mean?
What does this symbol mean?
Why are you afraid of it?
It's killing him!
That's enough!
Move!
Kill it now!
Dad!
He's breathing.
Someone call
a medical team!
Is it dead?
DIKEMBE: I told you.
You kill them
from behind.
SAM: Daisy, stop crying.
FELIX: She's scared.
MAN ON RADIO:
An evacuation order...
of the southern
and eastern coastal regions...
I want Mommy.
Of the Unites States
is in effect.
We'll find her.
They're both dead.
Just shut up, okay?
That's enough.
FELIX: You don't even
have your license!
SAM: Um, look around you.
You think anyone's
gonna pull us over?
The radio said
to go inland...
so that's where I'm going.
MAN ON RADIO:
Proceed in an orderly fashion.
There's a guy
in that boat!
I am not stopping.
Look, he was moving!
He needs our help!
Sam, stop the car.
Unbelievable.
Hurry up, okay?
I think he's just
knocked out!
CATHERINE: I don't think
it's a coincidence...
that this thing showed up
just before they did.
No, I think you're right.
Brakish, you should
be in bed, babe.
Where did you get this?
That's from the ship
that we shot down.
We need to cut this open.
WOMAN ON PA:
Director Levinson...
proceed to Command Center
immediately.
Call us soon as
you have anything.
Come on, people. Move!
Baby, I'm so happy that you
want to dive back into work.
Maybe we should
get you some pants.
Pants?
All right. Go on.
Why didn't you tell me
my butt was hanging out?
WOMAN: We have infrared
of the alien ship, sir.
CATHERINE: Are those dots...
They all must be aliens.
What's that mass?
Enlarge this section,
please.
That's what our prisoner
alien meant by...
"she is all."
Director Levinson...
I have Cheyenne Mountain
and the remaining
world leaders online.
LANFORD:
David, what can you tell us?
Ma'am, they're like
a hive and I think
we just found their queen...
their very big queen.
This is an infrared image
of their ship...
and we think that that's her,
Madam President,
right there in the middle.
Christ almighty.
General Adams,
we have a live feed
from
a reconnaissance aircraft.
Great. Put it up.
Yes, sir.
David, is this
one of their plasma drills
you briefed us about?
Yeah, I believe so.
The funnel's over
a mile in diameter, sir.
That's 20 times bigger
than the one in Africa.
I think they're after
our molten core...
which means
no magnetic fields...
our atmosphere
would evaporate.
Basically, the end of life
on this planet.
Oh, so, you're saying
we're already finished.
Not necessarily.
Back in '96,
the drilling in Africa stopped
when we blew up
their Mothership.
There must have been
a queen up there
that we didn't know about.
Assuming that this
hive theory holds true...
General, if we could
blow up this queen,
maybe it could work again.
LANFORD: All right,
then I'm authorizing
an immediate
retaliatory strike.
Let's do it.
Scramble the fighters.
Right away.
MAN ON PA:
Attention, all pilots,
report to mission briefing
in Tminus 10.
I repeat, all pilots report to
mission briefing
in Tminus 10.
JAKE: Hey.
Come find me after the briefing,
okay?
I'm so sorry, Dylan.
I was right there, man.
I just couldn't save her.
I was too late.
I know I'm probably
the last person
you want to hear
from right now...
but I've been where you are.
I know how deep it hurts.
She wouldn't want you
to give up now.
Come on, man.
You got to lead us.
See you up there, Lieutenant.
ADAMS: Good afternoon.
This red mass
on the top of the ship...
that's your target.
We're gonna send
a fleet of drones
to go in ahead of you...
and disable their shields.
Your mission...
is to fly cover
for the bombers...
who will be armed
with cold fusion warheads.
Now, the blast should
penetrate the hull...
and kill that alien queen.
Captain Hiller will brief you
on the flight plan.
We'll all try to converge
at the same time.
But whoever
gets to the target first...
will deliver the payload.
We have to expect...
that they're gonna come at us
with everything they got.
So, protect the bombers
at all cost.
We all lost someone
that we love.
So, let's do it for them.
MAN ON PA: Alpha strike launch
in one minute.
PATRICIA: Jake.
I'm coming back.
I promise you.
Make them pay.
We're not going up there
to make friends, right?
I looked at the houses.
The one on Harrison Street...
with the stone walkway.
If it's still there.
Okay, it's getting real.
It's getting real real.
DYLAN:
All right, form up. On me.
It's the Fourth of July.
So, let's show them
some fireworks.
I want you to give me
one of your katana blades
and teach me
everything you know.
Fine.
You know what?
I'll figure something out.
What are you
idiots doing?
Ah. The world's
going to end.
Even worse,
we lost the gold.
Mmm-hmm.
So, we thought
we'd drink a little!
The US Government
is on the line.
They say
the aliens are drilling
to the Earth's core...
and they're looking for
a ship in the area
to monitor their progress.
We're the only ones left.
Tell them we'll do it...
for a hundred
million dollars.
BOUDREAUX:
Look at this guy! Whee!
Yeah, hold on one second.
MAN: He's drunk.
They said, "It's a deal."
I got it. I got it.
BOBBY: Look, Sam,
they're going off road.
Maybe we should
do the same.
Ouch!
Shit. What the hell
happened here?
We rescued you.
Oh, thank you.
Is this really you?
Of course it's me.
Who else would it be?
BOBBY: What's your son like?
Can you get us his autograph?
BOBBY: How often
do you see him?
These days
we only see each other
at Thanksgiving,
but unfortunately...
last year he had to cancel.
What about you?
Where are your parents?
Um...
Visiting our grandparents
in Florida.
Oh, I see.
Where should we go,
Mr. Levinson?
I think the safest place
for all of us
to be right now
is by my David.
Since you're the leading
expert on his condition,
I really wanted you
to see this.
How can his connection
be so strong?
During the first attack...
he was exposed
to their collective mind.
It was completely unfiltered.
I need to ask him
about this.
I already have.
He doesn't even
remember drawing them.
Okay, let's try
this baby on for size.
You know, I helped bring
that thing back from space.
Is there anything
I can do?
Yeah. Back off.
Yeah. Of course.
Command, we have visual.
ADAMS: Roger, Captain Hiller.
Continue approach.
Mission is a go.
Bay-18, sir.
Why'd you put it
all the way up there?
Give me that.
Get the ladder down there.
Come on!
Couldn't leave it on
a bottom shelf? Here we go.
All right, coming for you,
baby. There she is.
What is it?
An alien laser?
Nope.
It's the Okun laser.
Why aren't they attacking us?
Careful what you wish for.
DYLAN:
There's the queen's ship.
Bombers, prepare to drop.
You just had to jinx us!
Evade, evade!
DYLAN: Fire on command!
RAIN: Two hostiles!
DYLAN: Squad, pull out.
Bank right.
Maintain defensive posture.
Down! Down! Down!
Protect the bombers!
Dive! Dive!
Command, the queen's ship
is too heavily defended.
We have to regroup
and find a new approach.
JAKE: We have incoming.
Damn, they're fast!
ADAMS: Jesus,
look at their firepower.
DYLAN: Keep them
off the bombers.
CHARLIE: There's too many!
I got you now.
I got you, I got you.
Whoa!
I can't shake them.
Son of a bitch!
Ah, come on. Help me out here.
I got you.
JAKE:
Dylan, that's me, 12 o'clock.
Ah, come on. Come on.
Bank left!
Oh, God!
Whoo!
You can thank me later.
Hell, I'll thank you
right now.
MAN: We just lost bomber 9...
and bomber 13, sir.
Command, we can't get
to the top of the ship.
It's too heavily armed.
We're dropping like flies
out here.
Come on!
I think we need to fly inside.
No, that's suicide. Sir?
Morrison's right.
This is our only shot.
Do it!
We'll detonate the bombs
from the Command Center...
and we'll give you enough time
to get the hell out of there.
DYLAN: Copy that.
Jake, follow my lead.
JAKE: I'm on your wing.
DYLAN: All bombers,
we're going in.
They didn't follow us.
MAN: Form up on your leads.
JAKE: Charlie, look at
those fields down there.
They have their own ecosystem.
Sir?
Dad?
You have to warn them.
She knows that
they're coming.
We got eyes on the target.
Tally-ho.
That's what we came here for.
All bombers,
open bomb bay doors.
PATRICIA:
Get them out of there!
It's a trap.
Come on. No!
Command,
I have engine failure.
We have engine failure.
DYLAN: Attempt to restart.
We're going down,
we're going down!
DYLAN: I can't restart!
JAKE: Come on!
DYLAN: We've lost all power!
JAKE: Command, you have to
trigger the bombs!
It's the only way!
Don't let us die for nothing.
Do it!
Madam President,
requesting authorization.
Permission granted.
Detonation sequence initiated.
JAKE:
Tell Patricia I love her.
I love you, too.
RITTER: In five...
four...
three, two...
one.
That's a negative impact!
The bombs were contained
by an energy shield!
The bombs
were contained by an energy...
We lost the signal, sir.
Wait.
Something's happening.
She baited us.
Tanner, we have to have
a status report.
We're trying.
Our satellites are down.
We're completely blind.
Madam President!
There will be no peace.
Careful! You'll agitate
the crystals!
I built it back in '94.
Had to shelve it,
though,
after the meltdown
in sector three.
Here, put her over here.
Brakish...
you're overexerting
yourself.
What is that thing
doing here?
All right, be a good boy.
Go stand over there.
Wait a second.
What meltdown?
Are we sure this thing
is safe to use?
Highly unlikely.
Clear!
What's the status
of the fleet?
Only seven percent
made it back to base.
Seven percent?
Yes, sir.
General,
Cheyenne Mountain is gone.
All members
of the presidential
line of succession
are presumed dead.
They're here to
swear you in, sir.
Attention to orders!
Please repeat after me.
I, Joshua T. Adams.
Do solemnly swear.
I'm so sorry.
You were right.
We're not gonna
beat them this time.
SAM: God, look at the line.
There's a thousand cars.
We're never
gonna get gas.
Have a little faith.
You wanna talk about faith?
My parents are probably
dead right now...
and most of my friends.
She's just upset because
her boyfriend, Kyle,
is for sure a goner.
What's a goner?
Someone who's dead.
Felix!
Why don't you pull over here?
Let me drive
and you take a little break.
Okay.
MAN: Not many.
I'm gonna try to get
what I can and salvage these.
David, you should be
in the Command Center.
President Whitmore.
Thank God you're okay.
It's been a while.
I had 20 years
to get us ready.
And we never had a chance.
We didn't
last time either.
We always knew
they were coming back.
But look how far we've come.
In the last 20 years...
this planet has been
unified in a way
that's unprecedented
in human history.
That's sacred.
That's worth fighting for.
We convinced
an entire generation
that this is a battle
that we could win...
and they believed us.
We can't let them down.
And it wasn't
luck last time.
It was our resolve.
We all have to fight...
till our last breath.
And that is gonna
lead us to victory.
You understand
some of their language.
I'd like you to tell me
if any of these writings
mean anything to you.
So, okay,
how about this one?
This talks about
an intergalactic war.
This concerns
the whole universe.
What about this one?
DIKEMBE:
Something about an enemy.
It needs to be destroyed
before it gets to us.
Wait.
I had a case study
in Brazil...
where my patient
didn't describe the circle...
as "fear."
He referred to it...
as "enemy."
Of course.
Their enemy is our ally.
Um, your laser's
smoking.
Uh-oh.
Get it outta here.
Tell 'em to try
to pull it open.
Hello, gorgeous.
Time to find out
what secrets you're hiding.
All right,
let's go get everyone.
Bring them here.
MAN: Yes, sir.
MAN 1: Watch your back!
Scorpio!
MAN 2: Come on, they're
picking us up! Move!
Jake, get out of the way!
BRAKISH: Guys...
you really need
to see this.
I've run every
possible scan.
It's not giving off
any kind of signal.
I mean, nothing.
It's like
it doesn't even exist.
It's almost like it's
trying to hide itself.
It's really smooth.
Hey, whoa!
You're not wearing gloves!
You'll contaminate it.
Remove your hands, Floyd.
That's weird. I can't.
What do you mean
you can't? Rosenberg.
Okay, I'm trapped.
Somebody do something.
It's swallowing me!
Just stay calm
and don't panic.
This thing
is trying to eat me,
and your advice
is not to panic!
Looks like
they're mobilizing.
David, please tell me
this isn't some kind of
a Trojan horse.
I don't think
it's a danger to us.
But it must be to them.
He turned it on
just by touching it.
SPHERE: I activated myself...
when I detected
your biological signature...
to be different from theirs.
It speaks!
In English!
SPHERE: I deconstructed
your primitive language.
We're primitive?
Correct. My species shed
our biological existence...
for a virtual one
thousands of years ago.
Far out.
Why are you here?
When I intercepted
their distress call...
I knew they would come
to exterminate you.
I came to evacuate
as many of you as possible.
But you attacked me
with the same weapons
they used on us.
They attacked you?
Correct.
A Harvester Ship
conquered our planet...
and extracted
its molten core.
They use them
to refuel their ships...
and grow their technology.
They have done this
to countless civilizations.
We fought them
for thousands of years...
but they destroyed
all of our ships.
I am the sole survivor.
BRAKISH: I am so sorry
to hear that.
Do you have a plan?
My system holds the key
to superior technology.
And there is
a hidden planet...
where I teach refugees
from other fallen worlds...
how to build weapons that will
defeat them...
once and for all.
CATHERINE: That's why
they're afraid of you.
You're the only ones
who threaten their existence.
Correct.
But now that I am activated...
the queen will detect
my signature...
and hunt me down.
It's too late.
She's already on her way.
Yeah.
She's coming.
Hey, what would happen...
if we were able to kill her?
No one has ever killed
a Harvester queen.
That's encouraging.
But as a hive...
her fighters will fall,
and her ship
will leave your planet.
Recalled by
other Harvester queens.
But it's too late now.
You must terminate me...
or she will get
the coordinates
to the refugee planet.
And that will be the end.
Wait, wait a second.
If we're so sure that she's
coming here to get you...
maybe we can bait her...
like she baited us.
Mr. President,
Dr. Okun thinks...
that we can replicate
the Sphere's
RF radiation signal...
David, English,
please.
Every computer has a
radioactive signature...
whether it's your laptop,
your phone, even your watch.
But the Sphere
has an RFR
that's completely
off the charts.
So, if we hide
the real Sphere...
inside the isolation
chamber...
and pack
this decoy transmitter,
so to speak...
onto a tug filled with
cold fusion bombs...
and lure her
out to the salt flats...
We can fly it right up her
royal ass and bon voyage!
You set off
cold fusion bombs...
you're gonna kill everyone
from here to Houston.
Not if we use
the shield generators
from this base
to contain the blast.
Without our shields,
you better put
a blaster in every
able bodied hand...
and get them ready
to shoot some aliens.
RITTER: Yes, sir.
Now, we just need a way
to see her coming.
Follow me.
Do your thing.
My thing?
Do my thing? My thing!
MAN: Take it off!
Copy, sir.
Watch it.
ADAMS: This old radar truck
was supposed to go
to the Smithsonian.
They never picked it up.
RITTER:
It's a good thing they didn't.
Yeah, drive it
to the highest point.
The higher, the better.
Yes, sir.
Look what I found
in the hold.
We should be able to
communicate with this.
Let's hook up the antenna.
What was that?
The drill is
cracking the outer mantle...
but that shouldn't happen
for another...
We were wrong.
We do not have seven hours
until the Earth core breach.
We only have...
one.
Call it in.
Area 51, do you copy?
DAVID: So, the idea...
is to get her
to follow this tug...
into the salt flats...
using the decoy transmitter
on board.
And once
she's taken the bait...
our cold fusion bombs
can go to town.
It's a Hail Mary!
But it can work.
ADAMS: There's a catch.
As you know, they took out
all of our satellites...
which means that somebody...
is gonna have to
fly it in manually.
And I know that I'm asking
for the ultimate sacrifice.
I know that.
But you...
you are the only pilots
we have left.
And I need a volunteer.
Let's get it done.
I'll fly it in.
WHITMORE: No, you won't.
I'll do it.
ADAMS: Mr. President.
Dad, what are you doing?
WHITMORE: Patty.
There are a lot of reasons why
I'm the best choice for this.
You all have to pick up
the pieces once it's over.
This is my part.
Matthew...
do not let him
get on that tug.
Do you understand me?
MAN: Get the hell
off the road!
If we go any slower,
we'll be going backwards.
Don't be a shmuck.
We have to conserve gas.
Area 51
is still 75 miles away.
We're running on fumes.
What do we have here?
Who's in charge here?
No one.
Our driver left us
to take a ride to Minnesota.
Just like that?
He just left?
He went to go have sex
with his girlfriend.
Yes! All aboard!
Wait! What about
our car?
We'll get a new one
when you get your license.
On the bus, everybody!
Tell the General
we're up and running.
ADAMS: Bring it in.
Spin it around.
All right, plug it in.
RITTER:
Radar is operational, sir.
ADAMS: Son of a bitch.
All right, they're
coming in fast. David...
we got a real fire storm
coming our way
and not a lot of time
to prepare.
Give me numbers,
Mr. President.
Nine minutes to
the queen's ship's arrival...
roughly 22 minutes before the
drill reaches our molten core.
Jesus Christ.
Take your positions.
We don't have
a second to lose.
Are we gonna make it, sir?
You bet your ass we will.
MAN: All right,
here we go, men.
Get up on that barricade.
Prepare to fire!
This thing is way cooler
than a machete!
Sorry! Sorry,
everyone!
That was my bad!
I'm gonna see
if it's clear.
Jake!
Hell of a time
to scare a guy!
Sorry.
Oh, it's good
to see you!
It's good to
see you, too.
I didn't think you made it.
Why not?
You haven't flown a fighter
in a while, so I figured...
You're alive,
that's what counts.
Enough with the reunion.
They're gonna hear us.
More of us made it!
You're still talking loud.
So, what now?
Go in guns blazing?
Hey, what are you doing?
You guys get to those fighters
and don't leave me hanging.
Wait!
Excuse me!
Down here!
There you go.
Listen, I usually
don't hold a grudge...
but you killed my parents.
So...
I'm gonna make an exception
for you guys.
Charlie, Rain...
you two
take the first fighter.
Been holding that one
for a while.
Their technology
hasn't changed at all!
Get the weapons ready.
Whoo!
New interface.
Shit.
Jake's in trouble! Let's go!
Getting a little
low there, Rain.
Nice!
DYLAN: Oh, no, you don't!
Should've kept running.
Get your ass out of there!
Take this!
Oh, man. Yeah.
Hey, thanks for that.
Get up there
where you belong.
What, you don't
want to fly?
Hell, no. I wanna shoot.
DYLAN: All pilots, go to
channel six on your radios.
Anytime, gentlemen.
You guys go ahead.
We'll cover the rear.
CHARLIE: Big closing doors!
Big closing doors! Jake!
Where are you?
We're on our way!
Rain, how long we got?
No, Rain, stop! Bank left!
We have to go!
No! We're not leaving
anyone else behind!
No one else dies today!
You with me?
I'm with you.
It's getting dicey up here!
Rain, just get out of here!
Respectfully, sir,
no way in hell!
Come on!
JAKE: Hey, man...
I just want you to know...
if we don't make it
out of here...
I'm really sorry for almost
killing you in training.
If we don't make it
out of here,
I just want you to know...
I'm not sorry at all about
punching you in the face.
Hey, way to go, Charlie!
Whoo!
JAKE: All right, we're clear.
You lead, we follow.
Faster, Rain!
Faster!
Hang on to your seat, buddy!
Jake, did you make it?
Rain...
did you see him
come out of there?
I'm not sure.
Jake?
JAKE: Did you miss me?
You can't do that to me.
I told you
you'd get lonely without me.
DYLAN: All right, aviators,
let's turn and burn.
Clock's ticking,
we gotta get out of here.
MAN ON RADIO:
Stand by for a broadcast
from the United States
government.
ADAMS: I understand that many
people around the world...
are tuning into this channel
on their shortwave radios.
To you out there
and here at home...
make no mistake,
this is humanity's last stand.
What we do
in the next 12 minutes...
will either define
the human race or finish it.
To those of you listening...
no matter your nationality,
color or creed...
I ask that
all of you pray for us.
No matter our differences,
we are all one people.
Whatever happens...
succeed or fail...
we will face it together...
standing as one.
WOMAN ON PA:
Decoy mission launch,
T-minus 60 seconds.
TRAVIS: Patricia!
Patricia!
What is it?
It's your dad.
He collapsed.
Come with me quick.
WOMAN ON PA:
Mission is fueled,
loaded and ready for launch.
Where is he?
He asked me as a friend.
As a father.
Dad!
ADAMS: Decoy convoy...
hold and ready position.
It says here, you got to
fly on Air Force One.
You meet the president?
My dad says your son
never went to space...
and it's just
a conspiracy.
Oh, yeah?
Your father's a putz.
Wait.
Do you hear that?
What, the kid
making fun of me?
No. That sound.
JULIUS: Oh, boy.
Kids, hold on
to your seats!
They're inbound.
They're gonna target
the cannon first.
We won't get
too many shots off,
so you just make
them count.
OFFICER: On my command...
fire!
I have to take this fighter.
We're still priming
the fusion drive.
It's only at 32%.
That's more than enough.
Give me the harness.
MAN: General,
we're up and running.
ADAMS: All right, Tom,
we are ready to go.
Activate the decoy transmitter
on my mark.
Three... two...
one.
FEMALE VOICE:
Isolation chamber activated.
The convoy is a go.
Give them cover fire. Now.
Now, Tom, now.
CATHERINE: It's working.
She's following the decoy.
Wait, what
are you doing?
It doesn't matter.
We're isolated.
I'm gonna turn it
back on.
ISAACS: Why would you do that?
To see what else
this thing knows.
Excuse me, just have a few questions,
if you don't mind.
Sir, there's
a school bus
headed directly
towards the trap.
No, no, no.
ADAMS: David, the queen's ship
will be there in two minutes.
DAVID:
Who is that? No, no, no!
There's a tall, dangling man
waving us down over there.
JULIUS: Tall, dangling?
That's my David!
Who is this blind idiot?
Yeah! Yes, thank you.
Dad?
BRAKISH: This is going to
catapult our civilization...
by thousands of years.
Our understanding
of physics...
wormholes, everything,
everything!
Hey, calm down.
Calm down!
I don't want to
calm down!
Ah! David!
What, we have to wait
for the end of the world
for us to get together?
Come, David!
I'm so happy you're alive,
but I'm busy right now.
You'll be happy to know
I made some acquaintances.
They came to see you.
I'm a little busy
right now, Dad.
You and I,
we're gonna have to talk.
I said not now! Look!
Yeah, I see...
ADAMS: Tom, it looks like
the plan is working.
She thinks
you've got the Sphere.
She's only going after
the fighters.
We gotta get these kids
to cover. Go, go!
It's good to see you
flying again.
Your place is in the air.
You should've let me do this.
You saved the world
once before, Dad.
I'm not saving
the world, Patty.
I'm saving you.
T om, what's going on?
She's in my head.
ADAMS: Mr. President...
you've got incoming fighters
on your 6.
Can you get me to the target,
Lt. Whitmore?
Yes, sir. Follow me.
Come on.
Go now!
Now, now!
Activate the shield!
FEMALE VOICE: Shield engaged.
ADAMS: Lt. Whitmore,
clear the blast zone.
Surprised to see me?
Do it. Push the button, Tom.
Do it, Tom.
That's right. We got you.
On behalf of
the planet Earth...
Happy Fourth of July.
Do we have confirmation,
David?
I think it's safe to say,
Mr. President...
that we got her!
Yes!
Wait, if she's dead,
why are her fighters
still attacking us?
Command, we have a breach!
ADAMS: How many do you think?
About two dozen, sir.
Under no circumstances...
do they see the Sphere.
You do whatever it takes.
Do you copy?
Copy that.
This is Sam.
My navigator.
Um... You're a lot taller
than I imagined.
JULIUS:
This is her sister, Daisy.
Um, sir...
There's Bobby.
Is that supposed
to happen?
Not good.
Oh, my God.
She has her own shield.
GIRL: What is that?
Okay, back in the bus, kids.
Back on the bus.
Let's go. Get back
on the bus!
Get her!
SAM: Ginger!
Where are you going?
No, no, no!
SAM: Come on, girl! Let's go!
We have to wait for
the dog? I guess so.
Hurry, Sam! Come on!
Come on!
DAISY: Get in here, girl!
Come back!
Okay. Close the door.
DAVID: Oh, shit.
FELIX: Oh, my God!
Drive!
PATRICIA ON RADIO:
All remaining pilots,
target the queen.
Unload everything you've got!
Did you hear that?
We need back up
down here, now.
We've got a serious breach
in cell block five.
We got aliens on the loose.
We need back up now!
Hey! Where are you going?
Oh, my God!
Where'd she go?
Sir, that thing
just leapt into the air!
What'd he say?
Something about jumping.
Look out!
Whoa! Whoa!
We are within
six minutes, sir.
ADAMS: David, six minutes
to Earth's core breach.
General Adams,
her shield is down!
Yes!
I repeat, her shield is down.
Great job, Lieutenant.
I got you, baby!
We're gonna
get you out of this.
Aim for her gun, Charlie.
Aim for her gun.
This is Captain Hiller.
We've hijacked
a couple of alien fighters.
Yes!
Yes!
Do not shoot at us!
We're the ones trailing smoke.
ADAMS: Roger that,
Captain Hiller.
Go on, get her!
Shoot her down!
ADAMS: Whitmore
destroyed the queen's ship
and his daughter
knocked out her shield.
Now, listen up! They're going
for our molten core.
You've got 4 minutes...
to destroy the queen.
So give her hell.
Copy that. No pressure.
We're really running
into an alien prison.
This is the one!
Open up!
We're here!
She knows!
She's coming!
Dylan, what's happening?
I don't know. My controls
just stopped responding.
Same here.
Charlie, do something!
CHARLIE: I can't!
She must have taken control
of our systems.
I think we're part of
the hive now.
Looks like
we're not the only ones.
DYLAN: The hell?
She's taking us
straight to Area 51.
What are you doing?
You're not going to
follow her!
Stay behind the yellow line,
please, Dad.
There is no yellow line.
Imagine one!
Take that!
See?
Told you
I'd figure it out.
You talk too much.
Baby, we're saved!
They got me.
Oh, no.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you to sick bay.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to make it.
Wait a minute. Wait.
You can't go.
Who's gonna water
the orchids?
Who's gonna make sure
you put your pants on
in the morning?
Right.
I've got something
I gotta tell you.
What?
This!
That was supposed
to be a sweater.
Oh, no, no.
No. Oh, no.
JAKE: What the hell
is she doing?
That's close
enough, David.
I think they're trying
to protect her.
DIKEMBE: More are coming.
Give me that thing.
Take that.
Two minutes, sir.
Two minutes until core breach.
Captain Hiller,
you've got two minutes.
Two minutes.
Man, we gotta
get out of this tornado.
JAKE: Every tornado
has an eye, right?
I think if we want to
get a shot at her,
we gotta get up there.
But how are we
gonna do that?
We don't have
any manual controls left.
Don't these things have
fusion drive or something?
CHARLIE: Are you kidding me?
That thing is made
for outer space.
Down here, we'll burn up.
You got a better idea,
Charlie?
Because from
where I'm sitting...
it looks like
it's our only damn chance.
Our only chance to die.
Charlie, shut up!
Rain, arm the thrusters.
You're all crazy!
DYLAN: One...
two, three!
Still alive.
You all right?
Whoo! Man!
I got the controls back.
JAKE: And our weapons
are working!
Yeah,
but our engines are fried.
All right. It's gotta be
a controlled dive, then.
JAKE: There she is!
Everybody,
we got one shot at this.
Let's make it count.
Thanks for always looking out
for me, Jake.
You got it, buddy.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's over.
You got 'em all.
Okay.
Except that one.
Oh, my God.
She's got it.
Fire! Fire! Fire!
Get ready for
a close encounter, bitch!
Charlie!
Go for her back
right where the tentacles are!
That's her weak spot.
Yoo-hoo!
Keep shooting, Charlie!
CHARLIE: What do you think
I'm doing?
CHARLIE: Shit!
This thing got ejection seats?
CHARLIE: Negative.
BOY: Look out!
I told you not to get
too close, David!
David, let's get out of here!
Back up. Go back!
We're alive!
We're rich!
Oh, my God.
General Adams...
the Earth's core is secure.
Whoa! Look at that!
SAM: She's dead. We got her.
JAKE: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Baby, put the gun down.
Jake?
Jake!
We're not even
married yet,
you're already trying
to shoot me?
Maybe we should try that.
You know.
Dinner, first!
Oh...
Director Levinson.
Well done.
Thank you,
Mr. President.
Good job.
Catherine...
Um...
Don't say anything.
You'll just ruin it.
Who are you?
David never mentioned a
beautiful woman in his life.
Dad!
I'm Julius.
I'm his father.
Enchantée.
I'm Catherine Marceaux.
Could you give us
a second?
I was never here.
Listen, maybe you guys should
stay with me for a while...
I think that
we'd really like that.
Yeah, so would I.
Are you okay?
SPHERE: I am. Thanks to you.
This wasn't all for nothing.
You are a remarkable species.
Not so primitive
after all, huh?
You think they'll let me
keep this thing?
You have the heart
of a warrior.
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.
Hell of a job.
We are rich! We are rich!
We are rich! We're wealthy!
I don't know if this planet
could survive another attack.
Excuse me,
Director Levinson...
you won't believe...
the weapons
and the technology...
this thing has on its
proverbial hard drive.
It wants us
to lead their resistance!
What do you mean?
Two words...
interstellar travel.
Take the fight to them.
When do we leave?
We are gonna kick
some serious alien ass.
