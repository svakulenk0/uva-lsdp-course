It's sad, isn't it?
I've been working
with you seven years.
Seven years.
I always liked you.
Always looked after you.
I never trusted you.
Hyah!
Hyah!
If you lay her there
At the bar across the room
She looks like an angel
With her paint
and perfume...
...and that is the secret.
That's the secret?
- Yep.
- Yeah, she's right, Tes.
Everybody knows that already.
Yeah, why don't you tell us another one?
Fine.
fake it.
That's definitely not a secret.
It kinda is.
All right, so how does
that relate to what we're doing now?
I'll tell you.
See, most women apply
secret number two to one thing--
sex. The rest of the time
we're too real.
Too real because it's
in our nature to be real,
which ultimately
is a woman's downfall.
But faking it keeps you
living in man's land.
Whoa! Who the fuck
wants to live in man's land?
We're already living in it, guys.
All right, wait wait, let me
ask you a question then.
Would you be faking it
if you compromise?
'Cause you can't fake
compromise.
You half can.
What the fuck
does that mean?
Compromise is half faking.
'Cause if you weren't compromising half
you would have it all, in which case
you wouldn't be faking.
You would be taking.
For example,
guys compromise when they
leave the toilet seat down.
They do it because
they know they can't win.
And I'm not faking it
'cause I don't pretend not to mind
when they do leave
the toilet seat up-- because I do.
Slow it down. How is that
a compromise on your end?
Yeah, and I thought that
you said we should fake it?
It's a compromise because I'd fake
other things to get my way.
Or I'd take away the pussy.
What are you even talking about?
I think
you're confusing yourself.
No no, I think it's just
too complicated for you to understand.
No, it's not at all.
I get what you're saying.
I just don't agree with you.
To me compromising
is not faking.
Fine. Then we'll just agree
to disagree.
Or we could agree that I'm right
because that's a compromise.
Tell you what:
I'll fake it
and we can agree on that.
Okay.
But you're compromising
to agree on faking it.
I can explain it to you
if it's too complicated.
I think she got you
on that one, Tes, sorry.
Thanks.
Hey'
Kara!
- What?
- Quit staring at that guy.
- I'm not staring.
- Yeah, you are staring.
Do you know what the word
"conspicuous" means?
Or do you want me to explain
that to you as well?
- Kara, stop staring.
- I'm not conspicuous.
We're the only girls in here
with all our teeth.
We're very fucking conspicuous.
Okay, but what if that's our guy?
I mean, didn't Mel--
Do you see
an orange rig outside?
What do you guys think
about Harry and Sally?
What about them?
You don't worry about them, Kara.
They're harmless.
So what if we missed him?
We spent, what? 20 minutes
with Deputy Elmore.
What if he came and left?
So, Tes, what are we doing?
Do you have a plan?
Mel did say 2:30.
All right.
So I'm guessing she runs the place.
And there's no way
this shit goes down here
without her getting a piece of the pie.
If anyone knows anything,
it's her.
Okay.
Okay, great, I'll take her.
- Let's find out what she knows.
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll take the door.
- Guess I got the trucker.
I'm not even gonna say it
'cause you all know what this is.
- You be cool, Billy Bob.
- Who drives the truck and where is it?
I said which one of you shitkickers
knows where the fucking truck is?
I...
Don't wanna know your name
'Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before
Okay
You think you got a pretty face
But the rest of you is out of place
You looked all right before
Fox on the run
You scream
and everybody comes
A-running,
take a run and hide
Yourself away
Foxy on the run
Foxy,
fox on the run
And hide away
You...
You talk about
just every band
But the names you drop
are secondhand
I've heard it all before...
Kara?
I...
Kara.
Don't want
to know your name...
What? Did you just
get out of the shower?
Yeah.
What the fuck have you been doing
for the last hour?
I've been taking a shower.
What have you been doing?
I've been putting gas in the car
so we can get the fuck out of here!
All right, dude.
Stop giving me shit.
Get yourself ready.
Tes is going to be pissed.
Oh yeah...
See ya, peaches.
I'm up on the 11th floor
and I'm watching the cruisers below
-  He's down on the street...
- See ya.
Oh, my heart's
in the basement...
Hey, I'm on my way out.
I'll see you in a minute.
'Cause she's hoping to score
so I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart,
walk out...
Excuse me, excuse me.
Uh, you're very pretty.
Look, you're not a--
- No.
- Well, I just saw you back there
and I thought maybe--
I'm sorry. My nam--
my name's David.
Well, Dave.
My friends call me Dave.
Now I know what to call out.
- Look, do you need a ride somewhere?
- Does it look like I need a ride?
I don't know, do you?
You know what actually, Dave?
Um, my cell phone
ran out of batteries.
Do you have one
that I could borrow?
- Yeah yeah, sure.
- Great.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Mmm.
I forgot the number.
Thanks anyway.
It's very sweet of you.
Maybe I'll
see ya around sometime.
So I lay down awhile
and I gaze at my hotel wall...
What was all that about?
Fucking jerkoff thought
he could pick me up.
- No.
- So I thought
we could use some gas money.
Fucking jerkoff
tried to pick me up and fuck me
for 45 fucking bucks.
Wow.
It's 40 more than I'd pay
for your ass.
Ha ha.
- I'm just saying.
-  And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small,
there's a taste in my mouth.
So what's the deal?
The deal is we're going
to some shitty isolated diner.
- Where?
- Somewhere across the river.
Why would Mel
send us over there?
He's never sent us
out of the parish before.
'Cause something big
has come up.
Apparently someone's running
a shipment along Mel's route.
Who?
Don't know,
but Mel doesn't like it.
There's a driver who's picking up
a preloaded rig down in the Gulf.
He brings it up the 220 and delivers
the bricks to another driver
who's waiting with the cash.
- Who's the driver?
- That's where we come in.
Mel wants us to get
ahold of the shipment
and find out who the pickup is.
Which brings me to the best part
of this whole operation:
neither man knows the other.
They only know where the diner is.
So driver A isn't going
to do something stupid
and risk getting caught
with a load of dope.
He'll just drive away.
And same goes for B.
I mean the last thing he's going to do is go crying to
the feds
about his drug money
getting ripped off.
We just make sure
we get there before they do
and wait for one of them to show.
Hey!
What?
I was listening.
Other side of the river. Fine.
It's fine?
It's a big fucking deal, Kara,
so you might want
to pay attention.
Mel wouldn't be too happy
if we fucked this one up too.
Speaking of which...
- Yeah?
- South on the 140.
Other side of the swamp.
Look for an alligator crawling
across the Chinaman's back.
Well?
What have we got here?
What's going on?
Evenin'!
Eve-evening.
- Little car trouble? Oh.
- Yeah yeah yeah.
Oh, it looks like your tires
are a little low there.
- Uh, yeah yeah.
- Yeah?
- It sure is.
- That's not good to be out here
at this time of night
without any air in your tires.
No.
We got us skeeters out here
the size of footballs.
If the heat don't get you,
they sure as hell will.
That's a recipe
for problems right there.
First thing you're fixin' your tire.
The next thing you know,
you're lying on the side of the road
dying of heat exhaustion.
What's your name, pardner?
Indicott.
Because I'm--
I'm-- I'm not in the car.
I'm out of a pot.
I'm Indicott. Get it?
Which is where
I wish I was right now
because I'm so tired
and it's so so so hot out here.
It is hot, isn't it, Indicott?
Well, Indicott, what seems
to be the problem?
You got a busted hose
or something?
Some-- some--
something like that.
- I-- I-- I--
- Yeah?
I just-- I just--
I just can't-- can't-can't-can't
seem to manage this engine.
- Mm-hmm.
- It's just-- it's just-- it's just--
I don't know what to do because
I gotta get to my girl.
And she-- she's--
she's just as sweet as a daisy.
And this-- this-- this--
this thingamajig right here,
it's just-- it's just--
it's just-- I-- I--
I just don't know
how to handle motors.
Well, you're in good hands
tonight, Indicott.
Why don't you step out of there for
a sec, let me take a quick look at it?
- Would you? Thank you.
- Yeah.
Hold on to this. I used to race
big blocks down in Douglas Parish.
I know a thing or two
about engines.
It's probably just
a busted hose or something.
Cuidado. Cuidado.
Care-- care-- careful.
Careful.
God damn, it's hot out here!
You know, last year this time they hit
about a buck 10 over in Bronson.
- Hmm.
- Yep.
Wow!
I see the problem right here.
You bought Japanese.
Guilty.
Next time buy American.
- Yep.
- It's my, uh, sister's car.
- Uh-huh.
- I just drive it.
Yeah well, you tell your sister
next time she should
buy American.
I hear the sound of falling love
As I wonder where you are
Hits the ground
with a dead sound
Know you ain't got far
Too stupid and sissylike
To say that you want out
You make the eyes
of a million girls
And think you'll
make them shout
Dead sound
Dead sound
Dead sound
Dead sound
I used to take you on
every time
That sparkle turned to black
I used to drag you
through my streets
When you came crawling back
Your cheap words
that you bought on sale
Won't help you through tonight
You make the eyes
of a million girls
And think that's what they like
Dead sound
Dead sound
Dead sound
And now you go through
a million girls
And try to pick what's right
When nightfall comes
and you're still alone
Do you feel it deep inside?
it's oh so cold
on the other side
Where thoughts
can turn you down
You make the eyes
of a million girls
But I see no girl around
Dead sound
Dead sound
Dead sound
Dead sound.
Hey, Dawn?
Yeah?
Does this feel funny to you?
No. Why?
I don't know.
Just that we're
I wouldn't worry about it, Kara.
What was the one good thing Mom used
to say to us when we were kids?
Always make sure
he wears a condom?
Oh no, wait.
Sorry, Kara.
That was what she said
right after your dad left town.
Oh whoops.
That's what she should have said
to your dad when she met him.
Oh ho ho!
I'm serious.
She said she wanted us
to trust in ourselves.
Okay, so I'm trusting
in myself.
And I don't know.
I just-- I know something
doesn't feel right.
Yeah.
You know what?
I'm trusting in myself.
And everything's telling me
that it is right.
And I know
Tes is a little tough,
but I need you to trust me.
Can you do that?
Yeah.
Well, you know what?
That's all right, Kara,
because you're probably just
overthinking things like you always do.
- Are you joking?!
- No.
I go along with every plan.
What's wrong with you?
What? I have an opinion.
Is that the problem?
Yeah, Kara, maybe that's the problem.
I wouldn't call it an opinion,
but I think that might
be the problem.
I'm just saying
try enjoying it a little.
I am enjoying it.
- A lot, actually.
- All right.
Well, when you really start, let me know, I'll pull out
the video camera.
Yeah, fuck you.
Fuck you.
- What are you guys laughing at?
- Me apparently.
- Thank you.
- Oh yeah? Why's that?
Dawn doesn't think
that I can enjoy anything.
- Can you?
- Really, you too?
- What do you mean "really"?
- Why do you guys always
- have to team up against me?
- Aww.
- I'm the nicest person I know.
- Oh really?
You guys are full of shit.
Oh, we just pick on you
'cause you're little.
Fuck you.
Look how big I am now.
- Okay, shut up.
- You know what?
I'm the boss, okay?
Everyone in here needs to shut up.
So I'm guessing she runs the place.
And there's no way that shit goes down
without her getting a piece of the pie.
If anyone knows
anything, it's her.
Okay, great.
Great, I'll take her.
- Let's find out what she knows.
- I'll take the door.
Guess I get the trucker.
All right, I'm not even gonna say it 'cause you all
know what this is.
- You be cool, Billy Bob.
- Who drives the truck and where is it?
Which one of you shitkickers
knows where the fucking truck is?
Dawn!
- Kara.
- Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go...
Baby, please don't go
down to New Orleans...
Mmm.
I was gonna save it for later,
but since your radio sucks,
I got us some tunes.
Lucky for you some of us
still live in the golden age.
Yeah?
What age is the golden age?
Oh, the '80s.
And not just the '80s,
- but Bruce Willis in the '80s.
- No!
- Oh yeah.
- Oh my God.
Get ready for "Respect Yourself"
like you've never heard it before.
Hey, Kara, even you might enjoy this.
- Hmm?
- Little Bruce Willis.
- Oh no.
- Kara, you gotta hear this too.
- This is totally it.
- No, I'm not supporting this.
- This isn't funny.
- Shh shh.
Who even comes out with this shit?
I don't believe it.
- No no no, girls, it's not funny.
- Come on, Kara, get some learning.
Wow, you guys think
you're funny, don't you?
- Oh yeah.
- Tes, take this shit out.
Throw this shit out the window.
This is my car.
Take the shit--
-  Come on, respect yourself...
- Guys, ugh.
- Dawn, why are we being pulled over?
- Just chill.
Respect yourself
-  If you don't respect yourself...
You gotta be kidding me.
Dawn, what's going on?
- Shit.
- Fuck!
- What does he want?
- Did you steal the tape?
- No, of course not.
- I told you!
- Kara, Kara! Come on.
- I told you. Did I not say it?
- Pull it together. Just for now.
- Why don't you start listening to me?
Shh! Just be cool.
Just fucking be cool, Kara.
- Evening.
- Evening.
How are you doing there,
beautiful?
It's hot, ain't it?
I can see you sweating over there,
but you just wear it so well.
You're just as sweet
as a little daisy, ain't you?
So where are y'all headed,
way out here this time of night?
- Sorry?
- I said
where are y'all headed,
way out here this time of night?
Yeah, uh, we're just--
we're heading up to see some relatives.
A sick relative out in Chaparral.
- Chaparral?
- Yes sir.
- A relative you say?
- Mm-hmm.
All right then,
on the count of three
I want y'all to say
the name of the relative
that you're going to visit
at the same time.
One...
two, three.
Uncle Mel.
I'm just fuckin' with y'all.
Y'all didn't even have to answer that.
No, seriously seriously seriously,
did it-- did it get you going?
'Cause that shit--
that shit never gets old.
Can I get your license
and your registration, please?
Yeah. Um...
Actually, you know what? Um,
this is actually my brother's car,
so I don't have the registration.
But think you could help a girl out?
That's all right.
We don't really get to do this
too much way out here anyway.
- Can I ask why you pulled us over?
- Oh shit, I'm sorry.
Your tire is low.
I can't have you drivin' out here
with no air in your tire.
You don't wanna be changing
a tire out here in this heat.
Miss...
Miss Samantha.
Now you were saying gray men--
That's right, Tom. The true friends
- do not come from outer space.
- Here we go.
I'm sorry, but from
the gray men beneath the bedrock.
It's a hollow planet, Tom.
It's inside of earth.
- It has to be.
- Well, you've got
your Area 51 in Nevada.
Well, I know that you've probably
not heard of Area 52.
- Uh, I think I have.
- That's in Hoboken, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.
- Right underneath New Jersey.
Yeah.
I'm taking two.
Randy?
Randy?
Randy?
Are you in there?
You in there?
Randy?
Randy?
Fuck.
Fuck me.
Elmore, pick up.
Hey, Elmore, pick up.
Elmore, it's an emergency.
Pick up.
We got a 10-27
down at Randy's stop.
Elmore, pick up.
Randy's been shot!
Fuck me.
Yeah, boy, I'm telling you,
this heat out here,
it'll kill you. And me,
I just-- I just wouldn't wanna
have y'all dying out here
and me having to call your mamas
and give them the tragic news.
Yep, no no, we wouldn't
want that either, Officer.
- Thank you.
- Cuidado.
Cui-da-do.
You gotta be careful out here.
Now there's a truck stop
just up the way.
I think y'all need to pull in there and
get yourself some air in these tires.
Yeah, great, will do.
Thanks, Officer. Sounds good.
In fact, I can follow behind y'all
and make sure that
you get there in one piece.
No, we're fine, Officer.
Thank you very much.
- We got it.
- Mm-hmm.
Come on now, come on.
You ain't got to call me officer.
You can call me Elmore.
- Well, Elmore, uh--
- That's my name.
Elmore.
Elmore Huggin.
As in "you hug me,
I hug you"--
it's a regular "hug in."
- You get it?
- Mm-hmm.
Elmore--
Elmore Hug-ins.
I just crack myself up.
- Huh?
- Yes.
- It's funny.
- In fact,
you know what I'm gonna do?
I can turn on them blue and reds
and I can escort y'all if you want to.
No!
No, really.
Just following behind us would be fine.
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah.
It could be fun though.
It could be fun.
Yeah.
Bet it could be a lot of fun,
but, you know, we're really fine.
But thank you so much.
All right.
You're the boss.
You ladies,
now you be safe now.
Great.
Thank you, Officer!
What the fuck
was that all about?
Don't ask me.
This is it?
This is the big exchange point?
Are you kidding?
Tes, why are there cars here?
I thought you said this place was empty.
- Have I been here before?
- Yeah, Kara,
it's probably the late night rush.
- Tes, are you sure?
- What is with the 20 questions?
- Yes, I'm sure.
- Hey, relax.
Relax.
I was just asking.
I am relaxed.
I'm very fucking relaxed.
Dude, don't get mad at me, all right?
This wasn't my fucking idea.
Genius.
What do you want from me, huh?
- I don't know right now.
- No no no, I think you do.
Tell me,
what do you want from me?
I want you to acknowledge
that it's a little strange that Mel would even give us
another job
after how bad
we fucked up the last one.
Okay?
And this is where he sends us?
I mean, call me crazy--
this doesn't feel weird to you?
- Dawn?
- Why do you do that?
- What? What am I doing?
- That--
questioning.
How long have we
been doing this for?
- How long?
- Are you serious?
Yeah. And how many times
has Mel ever steered us wrong?
How many, Kara?
- None.
- Right, none.
So what are you
so worried about? What?
Look around, Kara.
There's nobody.
No witnesses.
It's like the easiest job
we'll ever do. All right?
In fact, it's probably why
Mel sent us here--
so we can get our shit
back together.
Think about it.
Hey, is Mel fucking you yet?
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?
- Yeah, fuck you for saying that.
- Fuck you, Tes...
- Fuck you!
- ...for bringing me all the way
out here and never
fucking listening.
Chill, both of you!
Chill.
I don't even know what you guys
are fighting about any more,
but every time
it's like fucking World War III.
I don't care what it is.
We have a job to do,
so not one of us is leaving this car
until we are all fucking calm.
All right.
So there are these four nuns.
They're sitting outside
of the confessional.
The first nun goes in,
and she says "Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned."
And the Father goes,
"How have you sinned?"
She says, "I'm so sorry, Father,
I looked at a man's penis."
The Father says, "Ahhh,
that's terrible. I want you to say
your eyes with holy water."
So the nun says "Yes."
She walks out, says her 10 Hail Marys,
up to that basin and washes
her eyes out with holy water.
Second nun goes in, says "I'm so sorry,
Father, I have sinned. Forgive me."
The Father says
"How? How have you sinned?"
She said
"I touched a man's penis."
So the Father goes "Ugh,
that's even worse than the last one."
"I want you to go say 20 Hail Marys
and wash your hands with holy water."
So the nun steps out,
she does her Hail Marys
and washes her hands
with holy water.
Suddenly there's a commotion.
And the priest comes out,
he's like "Whoa, what's going on?"
Because the two sisters--
like three and four are fighting.
He's like, "Yo yo yo, Sisters,
what happened?
What's going on?"
Fourth nun, who's been
eavesdropping, steps out and says,
"I don't care what you say, Father.
I am not washing my mouth
in that water
after she sits in it."
Wow.
Nice one, Dawn.
- Dawn, you're retarded.
- You really just told that joke?
I like that joke.
My daddy taught me that joke.
That's even worse.
Right.
So I'm guessing
she runs the place.
And there's no way this shit
goes down here
without her getting
a piece of the pie.
If anyone
knows anything, it's her.
Okay, great. I'll take her.
Let's find out what she knows.
- I'll take the door.
- Guess I got the trucker.
All right, I'm not even gonna say it
'cause you all know what this is.
- You be cool, Billy Bob.
- Who drives the truck and where is it?
Which one of you shitkickers
knows where the fucking truck is?
Dawn!
Drop the gun.
Drop the fucking gun!
Put the gun on the floor
or I'm gonna put your fucking brains
all over that fucking table. Do it!
I'm not gonna ask you again!
You got three seconds to put it down
or I'm gonna put you down
like fucking Thelma ands Louise there!
Three.
Shut up!
Two.
Listen, Jesse Jane,
this ain't "Jeopardy."
You don't get a fucking option here.
Your only option is
to put down the fucking gun!
- Eh, fuck it.
- No no no no no!
- You put your gun down.
- Fuck you. I'm not dropping shit.
All right, obviously--
obviously none of us
are gonna drop
our guns, so let's just--
- let's just talk about it.
- Huh?
You wanna fuckin' talk?
This ain't fuckin' couples therapy.
The only one talking here is me and I'm telling you
to drop the fucking gun!
I know! All right, all right,
listen-- listen to me!
We'll both just put our guns down
at the same time.
Would you shut her up?!
Jesus.
See, I don't think you understand
what's going here fully. Okay?
If you had any sense left--
and I'm bettin' big on you, baby,
right now that you do--
I think you'd put that down before Mel gets here and
fuckin' blows us both--
- Mel?
- Yeah, Mel.
Big guy, blue suit,
always has fuckin' pecans.
Oh. Oh oh oh oh oh.
Oh, that's right.
You don't know shit, do you?
You know why? Because I'm
in fuckin' control of the situation--
- How the fuck do you know Mel?
- Oh, me and Mel, we go way back, baby.
- What?
- That's right.
That gravy train that you've been on,
it's over, so you might as well
give up now because there's no way
that you're walking out of here.
What about the fucking dope?
What about the dope and the money?
Dope? What dope?
There's no fucking dope!
it's the-- the fucking money?
The only thing I know about money
is our mutual buddy Mel
- pays pretty fucking good.
- Mel wouldn't do that to me.
Mel wouldn't do that to me. Mel wouldn't fucking do
that to me, all right?
- You're lying!
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut her up!
Mel wouldn't do that?
I bet he told you that someone
was infringing on his corridor,
is that right? That the story?
That the one you got? Hmm?
And he sent you here to fucking
figure out who was. Is that it?
Is that gettin' close?
Are you out of your fucking mind?
You think someone's actually running their own
shipment along Mel's route?
You think he doesn't know
what's going down here 24 fucking 7?
That someone's got the balls
to step up in his shit?
And you think that
if something were going on,
you think he'd send
you three fucking bimbos
here to figure out who it was?
I mean, even I'm not that stupid...
and I never even got
through high school!
You're slipping.
- You're getting sloppy, Billy.
- What the fuck are you doin'?
What the fuck are you doin'
wearing a cop uniform for?
The more prevalent question is
what the hell are you doing here?
- Why isn't everything taken care of?
- What?
What the fuck you care?
You're not in on this.
I care because
it's a hot fucking night
and I've been roasting outside
for over an hour
and all your dumb ass
managed to do was this.
Dumb ass? Fuck you!!
Shit got out of hand!
These two Midwest tourist
motherfuckers wouldn't leave
and this fucking cunt here
and her two dead sisters
decided to shoot up the joint!
I didn't plan for this shit!
Well, aren't you lucky
that I showed up then, huh?
Yeah. So quit standing there with your thumb up
your ass and help me out here!
- This bitch is volatile!
- Calm down! Just calm down.
Now would somebody walk me through what
happened here, please?
- They shot us.
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- They shot us and they shot my friends!
- Uh-- they?!
They shot-- they shot us!
You're the ones who decided
to go all "Boogie Nights"
and fuckin' shoot up the joint,
set off a nuclear fucking bomb in here!
They fuckin' shot Francine, Ronny.
- They fuckin' shot her!
- Oh, that's sad.
Ronny, tell this chick what the fuck's going on with
Mel and everything,
- all right? Help me out here.
- I'll get to that.
Why is he calling you Ronny?
I thought you said
your name was Elmore.
Why don't both of you just--
just put your guns down
before you two kids
get hurt here, okay?
Fuck you!
I'm gonna kill this fuckin' cunt.
Hey, you calm down.
Ain't nobody gettin' killed right now.
I am calm. Don't tell me to be calm.
I'm calm as a fucking kitten.
You're sweating like a junkie
over there. You just calm the fuck down.
- What the hell is going on?
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- Billy.
Who are you? Who are you?
Why aren't you doing something?
Me?
Shit, Tes,
you must have a lot of tears
clouding those eyes.
Come on.
You don't remember me?
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
I am the delivery guy.
Need anything else, honey?
You good?
You all right, baby?
Damn, baby,
wanna get in on the action...
That's the first decent piece of ass
I've seen in this place all night.
Tell me again, what the fuck
are we doing here, man?
Just relax, B.
It picks up, I'm telling you, man.
Later on this place will
be crawling with pussy.
- Fuck, this beer tastes like piss, man.
- Yeah?
This place smells like piss, all right?
Why aren't we at Cabaret Club
or-- or 4 Play, Zebras?
All right. Look around.
Look at our competition.
- What competition?
- Exactly.
Any other place
we're just a number.
- Here we get free fucking rein.
- Free fucking rein?
Of what?
King of the ugly bitches?
Seriously, I wouldn't fuck
any of these chicks with your dick.
Davon, I'm getting herpes
by just looking at these chicks.
Now I don't know what kind
of chicks you're nailing,
but I've got a stack of hundreds
burning a hole in my back pocket,
and I would rather let my pants
flambé my fucking cock off
than pay any of these trailer rats
to get anywhere near my dick.
I'm serious, fucker!
You need to relax, man.
I'm not sitting in some
putrid shithole just 'cause
you don't feel like you're up
for a little competition, man.
These bitches should be
paying me to be in here.
- Oh boy.
- Finish that shit
and let's get outta here.
Anything else you boys want?
Wow.
All right, thank you, God. This is
what I'm talking about right here.
- I told you this shit was legit, right?
- Whoo.
Baby, where'd you come from, huh?
Right over there actually.
You got a sexy mouth on you.
I love that shit.
Look, what do you say you get off work
early and we head out to my place?
Third floor, The Fairfield.
You know, I'd love that,
but I gotta work, honey.
I'll make it worth your while.
That's sweet,
but unless you're gonna make it worth my while
every day, I've got a job to keep.
She's got a point, B.
You know, make it worth her while, man.
Fine. All right. Look,
why don't you give me your number
and we can get together
after you're off, okay?
I don't get off until 5:00.
But, hey, how about you give me
your number and I'll call you, for sure.
Playin' me like a bitch now, right?
Look, do I look like a dumbass to you?
No, you look like a good tipper.
Tell you what,
for one of those bills, I'll hook you up with Charlene
over there.
She'll take care of you.
She'll finish you off before you
can even say "cock-a-doodle-do."
All right, fuck Charlene, okay?
I want you.
And I told you, I don't get off
until 5:00, so next time.
Hey hey hey hey.
Come on, come on.
I think there's a little misunderstanding here, all
right?
Come on, it's a simple question,
all right? How much is it gonna take?
- Give him a number, he'll pay.
- Oh no, I understand.
- Not for sale.
- Everything is for sale.
It's just business, baby.
Now look,
you're a smart girl, right?
Just give me a number
and it's yours.
Okay, you want a number...
four.
Four. 400?
Inches. That's the size
requirement for this ride,
and you're two inches
under the limit. Sorry.
Hey look, bitch,
I don't know who you think you are,
but this isn't
a multiple choice question.
All right, now there's a simple answer and you're
going to give it to me.
- Hey, man, what the-- ow!
- Hey, man, what the...?
Take it easy, man.
He's only playing with her!
You like questions?
Because I have got
a multiple choice question for you.
stay here,
pretend like you enjoy getting
sodomized by George over there.
You might like it.
...
- Ow.
- ...you can keep mouthing off
and get the record
for the quickest loss of your teeth,
which I can make happen
to you for no charge.
No charge!
you can pick up your jacket,
you and your boyfriend
can calmly walk out,
drive away and never come
into this club again.
- Now--
- Ow.
Cuidado. Cuidado.
I want you to think carefully
because I want you
to make the right choice.
- C, man!
- C, man.
He's sayin' C.
You're gonna break his arm!
Ay carajo!
You want me to break his arm?
Do you want me to break his arm?
No no no no!
- I can break his arm if you want me to.
- No no no!
- You sure?
- Ah!
Let your friend answer.
- Can your friend answer?
- Yes yes.
- Answer.
- C, C!
- C?
- Please.
- "Si" as in yes?
- C, yes yes.
- Or see, see?
- C.
- C as in yes, I let you go?
- Please.
- C?
- C-
It's a good answer.
It's a good answer.
I don't have to get bloody today.
- I don't have to get bloody today.
- Yeah.
Adios. Go. Vamonos.
- Hey, fuck you, man!
- Let's get outta here.
Wow. Thanks.
I'm Jessica.
Of course you are.
It's a beautiful name.
The guy--
was he worth it?
What?
You know what.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
You know what.
Come on.
Hmph.
an old condom...
a punch card for helado latte.
Fucking maricon.
He can't even drink espresso.
...Amex card.
Coño, it's a great haul.
You really cleaned up
on this one.
What are you, a cop?
No. Not quite.
Huh.
Well, that's too bad, isn't it?
A girl really likes
a man in uniform.
And I'm sure that
men in uniform,
they like you too.
You know you are
much too special to be here.
- Hmm.
- Huh?
Tell my boss that.
I don't need to talk to him.
I have someone--
someone who wants to meet you.
Come on.
Come on.
Wow, nice house.
- It is.
- Yours?
I am just the delivery guy.
The gate is open, you just knock.
- Okay.
- Hey!
Hey. Don't forget me.
And don't worry-- I will never
let anything happen to you.
You will come out
as fresh as a daisy.
I am for you!
I am for you.
I am hurt, Tes.
I thought you told me
you love a man in uniform.
That was two years ago.
I saw you for
Yes, but I remember you.
You were always special to me.
But, hey...
I won't hold it against you.
Mel never did encourage
friendships amongst his staff.
Right, Billy?
You dumb dummy.
How many times I tell you?
Don't open the door
to my house unless I open it!
Hey, baby, how you doing?
Good to see you.
You want a drink?
Get in there and get me
some goddamn bourbon. Go on, git!
Shut the-- shut the fuck up!
I don't even understand you.
Hey, baby.
Come on in.
She's just fooling around a little bit.
That's all. That's Darla.
She's a good friend of mine.
Clean it up! Up!
Nice tits, but-- ugh!
Really, sit down anywhere.
Feel free.
Not-- not--
wouldn't sit right there.
We had a little party here
last night
and there was
an accident in that chair.
But sit anywhere else
besides that. Really.
Oh.
You know, I like pecans.
I love pecans, really.
It's my favorite food.
I don't think God
has made a better f--
food than pecans.
Thanks.
My God, I like 'em.
I mean that's just a--
what do you think?
- I don't know.
- Allergies?
- No.
- Not allergies?
Well, in that case,
have some pecans.
I'm just playing.
But I'm not.
But I kinda am.
I do like pecans.
They reduce
your risk of gallstones.
I should know.
I had one.
Hurt like a motherfucker
right across here-- the abdomen.
I had it sonically treated.
Zapped it--
no gallstone.
Pete Rose had a gallstone.
Weird, isn't it, to think
that Charlie Hussle
- had the same gallstone that I have?
- Who is that?
Not a baseball fan?
Not really, no.
I wouldn't call myself a fan.
My mom used to take me
to some minor league games.
- Your mom...
- Yeah, my mom.
...Was a baseball fan?
She, uh, she did it
for my brother really.
Dad not a baseball fan?
Not exactly.
I do find you interesting.
An interesting girl-- Tes.
With one S.
Wow, impressive.
You officially know
everything about me.
Well, I don't know
everything about you.
And I'm not sure it's official.
But yeah, I know some things.
And how is that?
I always try to find out
as much information as I can
about the people I'm planning
on offering a job to.
- A job?
- Mm-hmm.
I already have a job.
I work in a little shithole
down on Third and Caulson.
- Yeah, I know that.
- It's a place called Spiro's.
- I don't know if you know it.
- Spiro's?
- A strip club. Yeah.
- It is a shithole.
- A strip club.
- It's a dump.
A dump, a dump.
It's been dump
for a long time.
I know it.
I own it.
The reason I pulled you
out of that bullshit nightclub
is because I thought that
what I had to offer you
would be interesting,
something that's better
than going to the bar,
going down there
and talkin' to the local guys
and lettin' them touch you
and just gettin' groped
- every night for three bucks an hour.
- You know what? You got the wrong girl.
- I don't do that. I'm sorry.
- Yeah?
Neither do I.
I serve drinks and I look cute.
That's it.
You do both
those things really well.
You also do something else
really well.
You know
what I'm talking about?
Do I look like a cop?
If I was a cop, I would have turned
your dumb ass in by now.
Shit,
Ronny would have
done that by now.
That was Ronny
out there, you know.
Did he tell you his name?
Yeah, probably not.
Anyway that's Ronny.
But I do empathize
with your problem.
Who doesn't want money?
Who doesn't want it?
Who doesn't need it?
Who doesn't have bills to pay?
I empathize to the Nth degree.
'Cause God knows it takes a special girl
that knows how to do what you do.
Lifting wallets?
Yeah, that's a skill.
I would say that you've
got some balls, woman.
You've got some balls that clank
when you walk
down the street-- no offense.
None taken.
I gotta get another drink.
I'll put a little bit more in there.
Let me get you one too.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
Did I hear you roar?
Did you make him cry?
He is a businessman.
And this is just business.
But for me, Tes,
this is the--
the business of my heart.
Business of your heart?
The business of your heart?
You let us walk into this,
remember?
My friends are dead
because of you,
you fucking maniac!
What did you think was
going to happen?
You think you were going
to work for a few years,
collect your 401 K
and retire to Boca Raton?
You are a drug pusher, Tes.
You exchange
drugs for a living.
You're in my garden
growing
On a summer night
Now the sky is folding...
Fuck Pete Rose.
It never looked so bright...
Fuck fucking baseball.
I'm a football girl.
I like Roger Staubach.
So don't sing me the goddamn
national anthem like I give a fuck.
You think I was lifting those wallets just to jerk
myself off?
See, I'm just a simple girl
who appreciates a buck or two,
but that's not why
I lifted those wallets.
I did it 'cause I'm good at it.
And fuck you
for not noticing sooner.
So do me the goddamn courtesy
and stop talking to me
like I'm your fucking
date on prom night, all right?
Like I don't know what you do.
Come on,
let's not waste any more time.
I'm willing and able
because I can.
I marked you.
Pecan?
I prefer walnuts.
But I'll eat your fucking pecans
all day long,
Mel.
Fuck.
God damn, woman.
Congratulations.
Come on.
Take a walk outside.
What do you know about coke?
Do you think you can bungle
$2 million worth of coke
and just walk away?
This last job,
it was your last.
You never answered
the question, Ronny.
What the fuck
are you doing here?
You know,
I am glad you asked that.
Actually, Billy,
I am going to need you
to hand over the money.
All of it.
What the fuck are you talking about?
What are you doing, Ronny?
Don't make this difficult, Billy.
Now there is an easy way
and there is a hard way
- and I will let you choose.
- Fuck you!
Fuck me?
No fuck you!
What the fuck, Ronny?
What the fuck are you doing?
I told you--
you can either do this
the easy way or the hard way.
And apparently
you are choosing the latter.
I didn't choose shit, Ronny!
Take your fucking gun off of me.
You have some dignity, Billy.
You are screaming
like a fucking schoolgirl.
Now I am getting mine,
and you're going to get it
and that's all there is to it.
'Cause I am done, Billy.
I am done.
What about the cop?
You shot a fucking cop, Ronny.
I didn't shoot the cop.
- You shot the cop.
- Me?
What the fuck you talking about?
I didn't shoot no cop!
You're fucking delusional, Ronny!
You think I expected you
to just hand over the money?
What about Mel?
What are you going to tell Mel?
That you shot me over the money
he paid me to get rid
of these fucking bitches?
- You let me worry about Mel.
- What's he talking about, Ronny?
What do you mean
"What is he talking about"?
It's just a setup.
Open your fucking eyes!
Can't you see the way he's acting?
He was gonna wait
for you three bitches to be dead
and then he was
gonna waltz in here
and he was gonna
shoot me for my money!
Which, by the way,
I don't fucking have!
You know you are half right--
half right.
See, after you steal the money,
you die valiantly in a shoot-out
with the unlucky deputy outside
while trying to make
your daring escape.
Then I take one
of these unlucky ladies,
throw her in the trunk,
take off and bang!
She disappears with the money
and is never heard from again.
That's me and her, Ronny.
What about you?
What the fuck you gonna do?
I was never here.
Wait, I thought you said there
wasn't any money. What money?
The money Mel paid him
to get rid of you three.
I told you it's not here.
I don't have it!
Ronny, it's me Billy.
Why don't you put your gun down
and let's kill this fucking chick
and let's get outta here together?
That is not going to happen.
I was planning on leaving myself,
but now that we are involved
in this little pickle,
I'm going to have
to take Tes with me.
Her? Come on, Ronny.
I'll-- I'll give you Jesse's half.
I'll give you all of it!
I thought you said
the money wasn't here.
- Where is it?
- No, it isn't here.
There's no cake here.
I'll give it to you when I get it.
You know Mel. Mel doesn't let
anybody handle the cash.
You of all people
should know that!
- You are lying, Billy.
- Lying?
I'm the only one here
who's on the level, Ronny!
I don't think so.
- I saw you.
- I saw the money.
Oh come on, Ronny.
That wasn't our fucking money.
What was it then?
It was this-- the tools!
- The guns!
- Wait a minute.
Why is Mel doing this?
I don't know why
you are so confused.
You know the policy.
Policy? What policy?
Do you think that Mel
gives two shits about you?
He is not there
for you like I am.
I have always
been there for you.
But Mel?
No strikes.
You fuck up once,
you are done!
Isn't that right, Billy?
He has always done this.
He is-- he is paranoid.
You remember that--
that chick he told you about?
The one that
went on vacation?
Welcome to Cancun.
And in case the pieces
are a little foggy,
this is why Billy is here.
And this how I fucked up.
I wasn't there to protect you
like every other job.
I've been there for you
every time-- every time.
But this one time,
this last time...
if I had have been there,
we wouldn't be in this mess.
What are you talking about?
You're fucked, Ronny.
Your stupid fucking plan
is flawed.
This chick
doesn't even know you.
Know me?
What the fuck
do you know about love?
Tes, I know you see it.
I saw it in your eyes in the club.
What?
What did you see in my eyes?
You can't tell me
that it wasn't there.
I saw it. It was there.
- There's nothing there.
- There's nothing there.
You know you are getting
on my fucking nerves, Billy.
You think Mel's
gonna stand for this?
And you think in your wildest
fucking delusions
- this bitch is even interested in you?
- Bitch?
You're going to treat
this woman with respect.
If you call her a bitch again...
I will shoot you dead.
Now Mel is the reason
why I'm here.
He is becoming careless.
He's becoming senile.
All he does
is crack pecans all day.
That's why I'm retiring.
I came here to collect my pension.
And now I'm going
to collect my girl.
Your girl?
I'm not your girl.
I'm not your fucking girl!
This mess is because of you!
You understand?
This is not because of Mel.
Mel wouldn't do this!
I'm so glad you are
such an expert on Mel.
How many times have you talked
to him over the last--
three months?
Once?
I work with the guy every day.
- I know Mel.
- Yeah, I know Mel too, okay?
I know Mel. This is just--
this is all just a test.
- It's a test.
- You think this is a big test?
Does that look like
a fucking joke to you?
We're all fucked!
Ronny!
Will you please shoot this girl
and let's get the fuck out of here?
I'm not going to ask you again,
Billy, to calm down.
Fuck you, Ronny!
You know what?
Since you are being
such a brave girl,
and Billy here is-is--
a whiny little bitch,
I'm going to make a deal with you.
You don't have to tell me
yes or no.
You just have to show me.
I want you to shoot him
and then we will
walk away together
- and disappear.
- Don't listen to him.
But if you don't,
I'm going to have to--
I will have to shoot you both.
He's full of shit.
He'll shoot you before you even get
a shot off once I'm fucking dead.
Look at what he's doing--
he's double-crossing Mel,
now he's double-crossing us.
You don't want to end up
like your friends here.
I'm telling you,
he's a fucking liar!
He's gonna fuck you
like he's fucked all of us.
He's gonna shoot us
and he's gonna take the money.
Will you shut the fuck up, Billy,
and-and-- and let--
let the girl think, for fuck's sake?
Let her make
her own decision.
How do I know
you're telling the truth?
I came in here freely
of my own accord, didn't I?
- Liar.
- I could have--
I could have did you both quickly
like I did them, but I didn't.
He thought he could walk
in here and put a couple in us,
but he's stuck!
You're stuck, Ronny.
Tes...
marry me?
I love you.
I'm telling you,
he's on the fucking insane train.
You're going to have
to shoot him now.
- You're a fucking psychopath!
- Make your decision.
Don't do it.
He's insane.
- Two, one.
- Don't.
Shoot him.
Don't fucking--
Shoot him.
- You can do it. Shoot him.
- Don't.
I am so sad
that you make this decision.
We could have worked.
- I am sorry, Tes.
- No no! Wait! I'll do it! I'll do it!
I'll do it. I'll kill him.
I'll kill him. I'll shoot him.
This is great.
- I knew that you...
- Don't--
...you would make
the right decision.
--Fucking shoot me.
Don't shoot me.
There is no money.
Ronny,
there's no fucking money!
Don't shoot me!
You need me to do
the countdown again?
- Don't-- listen--
- Three.
- No, don't fucking shoot me!
- Two.
- Listen to me. Don't fucking sh--
- One.
I'd write a letter
To my false true lover
Whose cheeks are like
The morning pink
Oh, love is handsome
Love is kind
And love is pretty
While it's new
But love grows cold...
What do you know?
As love grows old
And fades away
Like morning dew
And fades away...
Like morning dew.
Coffee?
Coffee's good for you.
It'll make you feel better.
I am...
done.
I am
done.
Don't even know who
the fuck I am any more.
I don't know who the hell
the fuck I am.
I'm gonna tell you
a little story, Ronny,
a parable.
You know what a parable is, right?
Like out of the Bible.
- Yeah.
- A long time ago,
these cowboys and Indians
were involved in a big fight.
American Indians--
pre-casino, big fight.
Big fight-- arrows, bullets.
You know how it goes.
One of these cowboys--
let's call him Bucky--
Bucky gets himself captured
by one of the Indians--
not just any Indian,
the big Indian.
Big world-famous fucking Indian,
Chief Running Bear.
So Bucky thinks he's fucked.
Thinks his life is over,
he's gonna be killed.
But Running Bear, instead of killing him, he takes
him back to the tribe.
And he forgets all about
being a cowboy.
He forgets all his cowboy ways.
Old Bucky couldn't want
for nothing.
As you can imagine,
him and Running Bear
got very close.
Very close.
Running Bear makes
Bucky his consigliere.
Bucky makes...
heavy wampum.
Heavy wampum.
You know what happens next?
He makes a mistake.
- He just started to get restless.
- Okay.
- He didn't have enough.
- No no.
He starts forgetting everything
that Running Bear had done for him.
He looks at Running Bear and he
goes "Look at this motherfucker.
He's drinking
too much firewater,
smoking too much
peace pipe.
I can do it better than him."
He just says "Fuck it."
Then he starts fucking
Running Bear.
And he fucks him.
And not no "Brokeback Mountain"
kind of fucking.
You following me, Ronny?
The moment that he starts
to fuck Running Bear,
he loses somethin'.
Do you know what he lost?
He lost fuckin' respect for him.
Respect.
Right.
He's looking at lost respect.
In that moment
the cowboy loses everything.
He lost the thing
that was most important to him.
And for what?
For what, Ronny?
So he could steal
a couple more furs?
All I needed was to have
something for myself, Mel...
something that would
let me know who I was.
I've been working with you
seven years.
Seven years.
I always liked you.
I always looked after you.
But I never trusted you.
Trust doesn't exist in this world,
does it, Mel?
No. It does not.
It does not.
I know you've been stealin'.
Was this, like, some kind
of goodbye present?
All this?
Well, Running Bear,
he had a heart...
Ol'\C6.
He had mercy.
He understood mercy once.
Can he set the cowboy free
in the desert
all alone?
How the fuck
would Running Bear do that?
Set the cowboy free?
Well, I don't think
that's going to happen.
He sets the cowboy free,
he knows that eventually
someday that cowboy's gonna
come back and start fuckin' him again.
What are we gonna do now, Mel?
You know what we do.
Maybe I fucked up,
maybe I made a mistake,
maybe I was desperate,
just trying to get something to feel,
you know, anything anything.
But I ain't going back
to the way I was.
Ain't going back to the way I was.
I wouldn't do that to you, Ronny.
I wouldn't send you back.
You know why?
Because Running Bear
has respect.
There was never any money,
was there?
Not for you, cowboy.
Why don't you tell me a story?
I liked that, uh, that cowboy story.
I liked that.
Only this time, could you--
could you--
let the cowboy
and the cowgirl
ride off into
the sunset together?
Somethin'--
somethin' good.
Somethin'
with a happy ending.
I'm all out of stories.
Sorry, cowboy.
Been nice knowing you.
On the banks
Of the river
Stood Running Bear
Young Indian brave...
On the other
Side of the river...
- Fuck!
-  Stood his lovely
- Hey, baby.
-  Indian maid...
Tes, what's up?
White Dove was her name...
But their tribes
fought with each other
So their love
Could never be--
White dove was her name...
But their tribes
fought with each other
So their love
Could never be
Running Bear loved
little White Dove
With a love
As big as the sky
Running Bear loved
little White Dove...
Toss it.
With a love
That couldn't die...
Walk you to the counter
What you got to offer?
-  Pick you out a soda
-  Look at you forever
-  Walk you to the water
-  Your eyes like a casino
You ain't born typical
-  Find a piece of silver
-  As pretty as a diagram
-  Go down to the Rio
-  Put it in my left hand
-  Put it in a fruit machine
-  Everyone's a winner
Laughing like a seagull
You are fever, you are fever
You ain't born typical
You are fever, you are fever
You ain't born typical
-  Living in a suitcase
-  Meet a clown, fall in love
-  Dying to have you over
-  Clown around and break up
-  Take it to a jukebox
-  That's the situation
-  Pick you out a number
-  And that's our arrangement
Dancing on the legs
of a newborn pony
Left, right, left, right,
keep it up, son
Go ahead and have her,
go ahead and leave her
You only ever had her
when you were a fever...
- I got Elmore.
-  I am a fever, I am a fever
I ain't born typical
I am a fever, I am a fever
I ain't born typical
We are a fever, we are a fever
We ain't born typical--
Oh my heart
You have won me over
With hot ashes
They burn my eyelids
Come, gone are the days
Where I bowled you over
With intention
So gray
So gray, so gray
So gray
So gray, so gray
So gray
Oh my love
You have won me over
With hot ashes
They burn my eyelids
Gone, gone are the days
Where I bowled you over
With intention
So gray pain
So gray
So gray pain
So gray.
Montgomery
don't know our names
The empire closed down
long ago
What I can't carry
I won't claim
We were born
with this sadness
In our soul, Lord
We were born with this
sadness in our soul
Living
Forgiving
For going away
When life was getting sweet
The light that came through
When you stepped aside
Nearly made me blind
But I'm living
Forgiving
Like a bird that flies
On familiar skies
And yearns to touch down
I go my way
Sometimes lonely
Thankful for the love
That I've found, Lord
Thankful for the love
That I've found
Living
Forgiving
For going away
When life was getting sweet
The light that came through
When you stepped aside
Nearly made me blind
But I'm living
Forgiving
Living, forgiving.
