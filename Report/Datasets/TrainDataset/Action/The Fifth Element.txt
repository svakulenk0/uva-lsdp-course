BOY:
Ha! Ha!
Come, come!
Please! Please! Please!
Aziz. Aziz.
Aziz, light!
Aziz, light.
Good.
We start again.
"When the three planets
are in eclipse, the black hole,
like a door, is opened.
Evil comes,
spreading terror and chaos."
See the snake, Billy?
The ultimate evil.
Make sure you get the snake.
Yes, I've got your snakes.
I got all the snakes.
So when is this snake act
supposed to occur?
Huh? Well, if this is the five,
and this is the one...
Every 5000 years.
So I've got some time, then.
Ah, you bring them water.
Good boy. I will take it to them.
Go with God. Be safe from evil.
PACOLI:
You see here these different peoples,
or symbols of people,
gathering together the four elements
of life: water, fire, earth, air,
around a fifth one.
A fifth...
element.
Forgive me, lord.
They already know too much.
Ah, Father.
Yes, how are you today?
Well, Billy, well.
You have some glasses?
Of course.
Father, I'm so glad to see you.
It's the most extraordinary thing.
I mean, look,
it's the greatest find in history.
Yes. You must be parched.
Oh, yes, yes. I'm sorry.
I mean, it's like
a battle plan.
Here, the good. Here, the evil.
And here,
a weapon against evil.
I'm going to be famous.
Then... Then let us...
Let us toast to your fame.
Oh, yes. To fame.
Salute.
You can't drink a toast with water.
Billy, in my sack, the grappa.
Yes.
This I don't understand.
But this--
This could be something...
prehistoric.
Maybe. I don't know.
But wait.
Here. Yes.
BOY:
Look, look.
They're here.
PACOLI:
This man,
this perfect being.
I know this is the key. I know it.
This divine light they talk about.
What is divine light?
Aziz, light!
Much better. Thank you, Aziz.
My lord.
Father, this is the most
unbelievable thing I have ever seen.
Don't you think...?
Ah-- Ah-- Ah,
are you German?
Lord, I know he was about
to discover everything.
But there is no worry.
I was there in time.
MONDOSHAWAN:
Priest, you and those before you
have served us well.
But war is coming.
Stones not safe on Earth anymore.
This...
is really amazing.
The fifth element.
Take the stones.
My lord,
if you take the weapon, we will be
defenceless when evil returns.
In 300 years, when evil returns,
so shall we.
Oh, professor.
Professor.
Don't move!
I have a gun !
PRIEST: Billy.
Please, understand.
They are our friends.
Friends?
Father, they've killed the professor!
They're monsters!
I'll explain everything.
Billy.
You're with them?
PRIEST: Billy, look at me.
Look at me. I am your friend.
No, Father.
Billy, look at me!
Please, put the gun down.
No.
Billy, no!
Hurry! The wall is closing !
MONDOSHAWAN:
Here is your mission now:
Pass your knowledge to the next
priest as it was passed on to you.
I will do as you command,
but please, hurry, you still
have time.
MONDOSHAWAN:
Time not important.
Only life important.
I will fulfil my mission !
You can count on me!
I will pass the knowledge
until your return.
Anything yet?
No, sir.
Not even a temperature?
The thermo-analysers have jammed.
One of them shows
a million degrees,
the others minus 5000.
Let's see it.
It's taking shape.
Send out a probe.
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen, the president
of the Federated Territories.
On air with General Staedert
in 30 seconds.
Oh, I saved this seat
for you, Father.
President on the line, sir.
We're in position,
Mr. President.
I have to address the
Supreme Council in 10 minutes.
Just the facts, general.
There are no results from
the chemical and molecular
analysis as yet.
All the calibres
are overshot.
We're initiating
a thermonucleatic imaging.
So, what you're saying is,
you don't know what this is.
Not yet, sir. All we know is,
it just keeps getting bigger.
Recommendation?
My philosophy, Mr. President,
is shoot first and ask questions later.
I don't like uninvited guests.
All right, then, Staedert--
CORNELIUS: Mr. President?
Yes?
COMPUTER: Priest Vito Cornelius,
expert of astrophenomenon.
I have a different theory
to offer you, sir.
You have 20 seconds.
Imagine for a moment that this
thing is not anything
that can be identified
because it prefers not to be.
Wherever there is life,
it brings death...
because it is evil. Absolute evil.
One more reason to shoot first.
Evil begets evil, Mr. President.
Shooting will only
make it stronger.
Probe will obtain its objective
in five seconds.
Growth rate is at 27 percent.
Your theory is interesting,
Father, but we don't have time
to go into that right now.
Time is of no importance,
Mr. President. Only life is important.
You're right.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.
We're gonna protect the life of some
General, you may fire when ready.
Up-front loading of a 120-ZR missile.
Marker lights on the objective.
Its structure has just solidified
on the surface.
I think it's anticipating the attack.
Anticipation denotes intelligence.
The most terrible intelligence
imaginable, Mr. President.
The ship is in combat formation.
Missiles are loaded, Mr. President.
Staedert.
STAEDERT: Yes, sir.
I have a doubt.
I don't, Mr. President.
Staedert?
What happened?
Staedert, can you hear me?
Staedert? What happened,
Staedert?
Did you destroy it?
I'm about to, sir.
The planet has increased
in diameter by 200 percent.
It's moving towards
the ship.
What--? What do we have
that's bigger than 240?
Nothing, sir.
Staedert, do you hear me?
Get out of there.
I don't want an incident.
Do you hear me, Staedert?
Get out of there.
Can you hear me, Staedert?
Do you understand? Listen.
This is the president.
That's an order.
Do you understand me?
Do you hear me?
Get out of there! Answer me!
Good God !
COMPUTER:
Four a day.
I'm trying.
COMPUTER:
To quit is my goal.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm up.
All right, I'm up.
God.
Yeah. Yeah. Yes?
MAN :
Hey, dog brain, Finger here.
Hi, sweetie.
I love you too, major,
but you haven't called me that
since basic training.
I was talking to the cat.
Oh, yeah, I forgot,
you still prefer your cat
to the real thing.
KORBEN:
At least the cat comes back.
You still pining for that two-timing
slut? Forget about it, man.
There are a million women out there.
I don't want a million women.
I just want one.
The perfect one.
It don't exist, major.
Yeah, I know. Ugh.
What?
I just found a picture of you.
Oh, how so I look?
Like shit.
Must be an old picture.
Listen, you gotta bring me your hack
for a six-month overhaul.
Negative.
ASAP.
I don't need one.
Hey, you forgetting who sat
next to you for 1000 missions?
I know how you drive.
Finger, I drive a cab now,
not a space fighter.
Okay, so tell me. How many points
you got left on your license?
Major, how many points?
At least 50.
Know what?
You gotta learn how to lie better.
See you tonight.
FEMALE VOICE:
Welcome to paradise.
MAN :
Welcome to Fhloston Paradise.
It's Ruby Rhod, your main man,
and I will tell you live at 5
the name of the winner of the
super-green Gemini Croquette
Contest!
The winner will go with me
for two days to Fhloston Paradise.
So tune in to Radio Cosmos.
Don't watch it all day, sweetie.
It'll rot your brain.
For a perfect world.
Give me the cash.
Been here long?
Yeah, long enough.
Come on, give me the cash.
Is that a Z-140?
Alleviated titanium.
Neurocharged assault model.
Yeah. Yeah.
Good thing for me it's not loaded.
What do you mean, it's not loaded?
Well, you have to...
You have to push that little
yellow button to load it.
Take your time.
Oh, God.
You want me to--?
Okay.
There you go.
Give me the cash !
That's a very dangerous gun.
You know, maybe you better let me
hang on to this one for you, huh?
You don't mind, do you?
MUGGER: No.
You sure?
No. Take it. I don't need it.
That's a very nice hat.
You like it?
God !
COMPUTER:
Please enter your license.
Yes, yes, just a minute.
COMPUTER:
Welcome onboars, Mr. Dallas.
Good morning. Sleep well?
Yeah, me too.
I had a horrible nightmare.
Propulsion 2X4.
You have five points left
on your license.
Yeah, thank you for reminding me.
Have a nice day.
Why not?
You have 48 hours.
That's the length of time
it needs to adapt itself
to our living conditions.
And then?
And then it will be too late.
The goal of this thing is not
to fight over money or power...
but to exterminate life.
All forms of life.
So what you're telling me, Father,
there's nothing that can stop this.
There is only one thing.
CORNELIUS: The Mondoshawan
have in their possession the
only weapon to defeat evil.
Four elements...
gathered around a fifth...
supreme being, the ultimate warrior,
created to protect life.
Together they produce what the
ancients called the Light of Creation.
Able to bring life to the farthest
reaches of the universe.
But if evil stands there...
Then what?
Then light turns to dark.
Life to death...
forever.
Sir, there's a Mondoshawan
spaceship at the frontier requesting
permission to enter our territory.
PRESIDENT:
Give it permission to enter our
territory with our warmest regards.
Thank you.
MAN:
Permission to enter granted.
Showtime.
We are lost.
MANGALORE:
Aknot, we are connected to Earth.
Mr. Zorg's office.
AKNOT :
It's Aknot.
ZORG:
I'm so glad to hear you, Aknot.
AKNOT :
The mission is accomplished.
You'll have what you asked for
in a few hours.
ZORG:
Good. I'll meet you at my factory.
The attack was launched by
two unregistered warships.
Close all borders and
declare a state of general alert.
Yes, sir.
Try to make contact
with the Mondoshawans.
We owe them an explanation.
Sir.
Three hundred years
of waiting, for nothing.
Father, you should go home now
and get some rest.
No.
The Mondoshawan...
I am their contact on Earth.
They will come for me.
Father, this is government business
now. I will keep you informed.
The rescue team has reported
from the Mondoshawan crash site.
Any survivors?
Only one.
MUNRO:
That what you call a survivor?
A few cells are still alive.
It's more than I need.
Have you at least identified it?
MACTILBURGH: We tried,
but the computer
went off the charts.
You see, normal human beings
have 40 DNA memo groups,
which is more than enough
for any species to perpetuate itself.
This has 200,000 memo groups.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Yeah, can't wait to meet him.
You okay, general? Over here.
Excuse me.
Okay, general, I want to
show you something here.
This is a normal human
DNA chain, okay?
You, me, anybody, right?
Watch this.
The compositional elements of his
DNA chain are the same as ours.
There's simply more of them,
tightly packed, with infinite
genetic knowledge.
Almost like this being
was engineered.
Is there any danger?
No, no, no.
We put it through
the cellular hygiene detector.
The cell is, for lack
of a better word,
perfect.
Okay, go ahead.
But Mr. Perfect
better be polite.
Otherwise, I turn him
into cat food.
Activate it.
Tissue processing.
Ten seconds to ultraviolet protection.
MACTILBURGH:
This is the last phase.
The cells are bombarded
by slightly greasy solar atoms
which forces the body
to react to protect itself.
That means growing skin.
Wonderful.
Reconstruction complete.
Remove the shield.
I told you. Perfect.
Thermal bandages.
I'd, um, like to
take a few pictures...
for the archives.
What's she saying?
I don't know.
Activate the phonic detector.
Is, uh...? Is that thing solid?
Unbreakable.
Good.
If you want out,
you're going to have to learn to
develop those communication skills.
General alert.
Perfect.
Ladder on 18.
Two men with me.
The rest in the main ventilation.
Okay, sir.
This way.
OFFICER 1:
Okay, lady, stay calm.
This is the police.
There's nowhere else to go.
So you're gonna slowly turn around
and put your hands on the floor.
Do you understand me?
She doesn't.
I think we need a flying unit here.
OFFICER 2 :
This is the police.
This is the police.
We are processing
your identification.
Please put your arms up
and follow our instructions.
She has no file.
She dove off.
COMPUTER:
You just had an accident.
Yes, I know I just had an accident,
you daffy bastard !
You have a point left on your license.
COMPUTER: You have a point left...
Look out!
No, no! Left!
I can't believe it. Shit.
Any survivors?
Hi.
Are you okay?
Boom.
Boom. Yeah, I understand "boom."
Bada boom.
Big. Big bada boom.
Big...
Bada big boom.
Big boom.
Yeah.
Yeah, big bada boom.
Bada boom.
Big boom. Big bada boom.
You know, you're lucky
you're not dead.
OFFICER :
This is a police control.
Please keep your hands
on the wheel.
You have an unauthorized
passenger in your vehicle.
We are going to arrest her.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sorry, honey.
Looks like this is your ride.
Open the door.
Better do what they say.
Sorry.
"Please...
help."
I've only got one point left
on my license,
and I need that to get back
to the garage and get the cab
a six-month overhaul.
You understand?
Can you please
open the passenger door?
Ple... Please...
help.
I can't.
OFFICER :
I repeat,
can you please open
your passenger door.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Why not?
Thank you for your cooperation.
Help.
Finger's gonna kill me.
Emergency! Emergency!
COMPUTER: One point has been
removed from your license.
Yes, I know!
COMPUTER:
--on your license.
This is so stupid.
WOMAN :
All units assist in pursuit
of yellow cab, level 10.
Unit 47, we're on the way,
as soon as we finish lunch.
Two golden menus.
OFFICER 1: Thank you.
OFFICER 2: I'm too old, too tired,
and too hungry
to go chasing some hot rod.
Thank you so much.
And I'm definitely too thirsty.
KORBEN:
Look out!
Whoa.
We got lucky.
If they don't chase you after a mile,
they don't chase you.
Maybe it's two miles.
Hang on.
Look, lady, I only speak two
languages: English and bad English !
Run an ID.
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for
conversation, but maybe you
could just shut up for a minute!
I get nothing.
He's got a scan blocker.
Means he's a car thief. Blast him.
I don't know what you did
to piss these guys off...
but they are really pissed off!
Hold on !
I think we're safe for a while.
You want to play it soft?
We'll play it soft.
You want to play it hard?
Let's play it hard.
We make it to the fog,
we'll be all right.
If we make the fog.
How do they expect us
to find anything in this shit?
We're just gonna wait here for
a little while until things quiet down,
if you don't mind.
Hey.
Shit.
You okay?
Priest.
You don't need a priest,
you just need a doctor.
You'll be all right.
Vito Cornelius.
What?
Priest.
Yes?
I'm, uh, looking for a priest.
Weddings are one floor down,
my son. Congratulations.
She's not my bride. She's my fare.
She's looking for a priest
named Vito Cornelius.
The phone book said he lived here.
Yes, that's me,
but I don't know who she is.
Nobody knows who she is.
No file, no ID, nothing.
She's got a tattoo on this arm here.
Tattoo?
Fifth...
element.
Finger's gonna kill me.
Hey! Wake up!
Who are you?
I brought the girl, remember?
The redhead.
She just dropped in on me.
Started speaking this bizarre
language.
It's not bizarre.
It's the divine language.
The ancient language,
Okay.
spoken throughout the universe
before time was time. He--
He's a she.
You noticed that, huh?
Yes.
It's a miracle.
Miracle she's not dead.
We've not a moment to lose.
Wake her up.
But gently, because this woman is
mankind's most precious possession.
She is perfect.
Perfect.
More dignified.
Hey, lady,
wake up.
You're right. You're right,
I shouldn't have done that.
I shouldn't have done that.
It was wrong to kiss you.
He said to wake you gently.
You're right. You're right.
Just thought you might
remember me from the cab.
Remember?
"Bada boom"?
"Big bada boom"?
Boom?
Boom. Big bada boom.
In the cab. Here, look.
I drive a cab. This is me.
Korben Dallas.
Korben. You understand?
Here. Take it, go ahead.
You can call me when you
learn how to speak English.
Oop. Ah.
Just kidding. Kidding.
And you-- What is your name?
You.
Korben.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-
Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Good. That's--
That whole thing's your name, huh?
Do you have...
a shorter name?
Not "yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh."
Short.
:
Korben Dallas.
Leeloo.
Leeloo.
:
Korben, Leeloo.
Leeloo, Korben.
Father, are you sure
she's a supreme being?
Absolutely sure.
Old friends. Okay.
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, listen, do you think
you could ask her if I could
have the gun back, please?
What's your name?
Korben Dallas.
Thank you, Mr. Dallas, for all
your help. Thank you so much.
You've been so kind,
but now the girl needs some rest,
because she's been
on a long trip.
Yes, I know. I was there
when she landed.
Wait, wait, hey.
Wait, wait, Father.
Listen, she said something
that I didn't understand.
Well, I didn't understand any of it,
but what does "ekto gamat" mean?
"Never without my permission."
That's what I thought.
I shouldn't have kissed her.
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
I forgot your food.
How about some nice Thai food
to apologize, huh?
Yeah, yeah, hold on. What?
FINGER :
Hey, buddy, I'm waiting all day here.
Finger.
Where is the cab?
Car's running fine.
Purring like a kitten.
"Fine." What "fine"?
I know you, Dallas.
"Fine" ain't in your vocabulary.
Now, come on, you can tell your
old buddy Finger what happened.
What? You save the planet?
Listen.
You dinged the fender again.
That's it, right? You dinged
the goddamn fender.
Finger, I was on my way over to
see you, and a big fare fell in my lap.
You know, one of these really
big fares that you just can't resist.
Oh. How big?
Five-nine...
blue eyes,
long legs, great skin.
You know. Perfect.
Uh-huh. I see.
And this perfect fare,
she got a name?
Yeah.
Leeloo.
What's she doing?
Learning our history,
the last 5000 years
that she's missed.
Been asleep
for quite a while, you know.
Father, I know she's been through
a lot, but we don't have much time.
Yes, you're right.
Chicken. Good.
Chicken.
I'm really sorry to
interrupt you...
but the case...
with the stones...
where is it?
Stolen?
Who in God's name
would do such a thing?
Excuse me, sir.
The council is worried about
the economy heating up.
They wondered if it'd be
possible to fire 500,000.
I thought maybe from one
of the smaller companies
where no one would notice,
like one of the
cab companies.
ZORG:
Fire 1 million.
But 500,000...
One million. Fine, sir.
Sorry to have disturbed you.
Oh, it's, uh...
It's for the Supreme...
Yes, yes, yes.
Oh, sorry.
I didn't know your size, and l
found you this makeup box, okay?
You just put it like that.
Thank you.
Yes, there was a man with a limp...
came here about a month ago
asking questions about the stones.
He said he was an art dealer.
What was his name?
I'm so bad with names.
They really make her--
Perfect, I know.
What did she say?
CORNELIUS: She says she knows
exactly where they are.
My dear Aknot, how about those
two little planes that you borrowed?
Aknot, is that you?
What an ugly face.
It doesn't suit you.
Take it off.
That's better.
Never be ashamed of who you are.
You're warriors. Be proud.
So what if the federal government
scattered your people to the wind.
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.
Your time for revenge
is at hand. Voilà.
The ZF-1.
It's light. Handle's adjustable
for easy carrying.
Good for righties and lefties.
Breaks down into four parts,
undetectable by X-ray. Ideal
for quick, discreet interventions.
A word on firepower:
Titanium recharger, 3000-round clip
with bursts of 3 to 300.
With the replay button, another
Zorg invention, it's even easier.
One shot...
and replay sends every following
shot to the same location.
And to finish the job,
all the Zorg oldies but goldies.
Rocket launcher.
Arrow launcher with exploding
or poisonous gas heads.
Very practical.
Our famous net launcher.
The always-efficient
flamethrower.
My favourite.
And for the grand finale,
the all-new ice-cube system.
Four full crates
delivered right on time.
And what about you,
my dear Aknot? Did you bring
me what I asked you for?
Yes.
Magnificent.
This--
This case is empty.
What do you mean, empty?
Empty,
the opposite of full.
This case is supposed to be full !
Anyone care to explain?
The Guardians gave the stones
to someone they could trust.
Who took another route.
She's supposed
to contact this person
in a hotel.
And she's looking
for the address. Easy.
Dot.
It's Planet Fhloston,
in the Angel Constellation.
We're saved.
I'm screwed.
You asked for a case.
We brought you a case.
A case with four stones in it!
Not one or two or three,
but four!
Four stones!
What the hell am I supposed to do
with an empty case?
We are warriors, not merchants.
But you can still count!
Look, it's easy. Look at my fingers.
Four stones, four crates.
Zero stones, zero crates!
Pack everything up!
We're out of here!
AKNOT:
We risked our lives.
I believe a little compensation
is in order.
Oh. So you are merchants
after all.
Leave him one crate
for the cause.
I don't like warriors.
Too narrow-minded, no subtlety,
and worse, they fight
for hopeless causes, honour.
Honour's killed millions of people.
Hasn't saved a single one.
I'll tell you what I do like, though:
a killer.
A dyed-in-the-wool killer,
cold-blooded, clean, methodical
and thorough.
Now, a real killer,
when he picked up the ZF-1,
would've immediately asked
about the little red button
on the bottom of the gun.
Bring me the priest.
I got everything here we need
to know about Fhloston Paradise
and a detailed blueprint
of the entire hotel.
Good work, my son.
Now all we've got to do is
find a way of getting there.
It's not gonna be easy.
There's a big charity ball
on Fhloston tomorrow.
The flights are full for months,
and with all the celebrities, the hotel
will be guarded like a fortress.
But there must be a way
of getting there.
No.
I'll get it.
Weddings?
Not really.
Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you.
Mister who?
Mr. Zorg.
ZORG:
Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel
Zorg.
It's nice to see you again, Father.
Ah, I remember you now.
The so-called art dealer.
I'm glad you got your memory back,
because you're gonna need it.
Where are the stones?
I don't know. And even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell somebody like you.
Why?
What's wrong with me?
I try to serve life.
But you only
seem to want to destroy it.
Ah, Father...
you're so wrong. Let me explain.
Life, which you so nobly serve,
comes from destruction,
disorder and chaos.
Now, take this empty glass.
Here it is, peaceful, serene, boring.
But if it is...
destroyed...
Look at all these little things.
So busy now.
Notice how each one is useful.
What a lovely ballet ensues,
so full of form and colour.
Now, think about all those people
that created them.
Technicians, engineers.
Hundreds of people who will be able
to feed their children tonight
so those children can grow up
big and strong and have little
teeny-weeny children of their own
and so on and so forth.
Thus adding to the great chain...
of life.
FEMALE VOICE:
Water. Fruit.
You see, Father, by creating
a little destruction...
FEMALE VOICE:
A cherry.
I'm, in fact, encouraging life.
In reality, you and l
are in the same business.
Cheers.
Where's the robot
to pat you on the back?
Or the engineer?
Or their children, maybe?
There, you see now how all
your so-called power counts
for absolutely nothing?
How your entire empire
of destruction comes crashing down,
all because of
one little cherry.
You saved my life,
and in return, I'll spare yours...
for now.
You're a monster, Zorg.
I know.
Torture who you have to,
the president, I don't care.
Just bring me those stones.
You have one hour.
It's gobbling up all the
communications satellites
in the galaxy.
Why in the hell
is it eating up all the satellites?
We're working on it,
Mr. President.
I've managed to contact
the Mondoshawan.
They deplore the incident,
but they accept our apologies.
And the stones?
Did you find them in the wreckage?
The stones weren't aboard the ship.
What do you mean?
The Mondoshawan never
fully trusted the human race.
So they gave up the stones
to someone they do trust.
Her name is Plavalaguna.
She's a diva.
And she's going to sing at a
charity ball in Fhloston Paradise
in a few hours.
She has the stones with her.
The Mondoshawans
have accepted an offer to help.
All we have to do is send someone
to get the stones and bring them
back to her.
Excellent.
I want this operation to be
discreet as possible.
No troops. No big operation.
I want your best man
to go undercover.
I have the perfect one.
You got a message.
Yeah.
Not gonna open it?
Could be important.
Yeah. Like the last two I got
were important.
First one was from my wife
telling me she's leaving.
The second one was from
my lawyer telling me he was
leaving with my wife.
That is bad luck.
But grandfather say:
"It never rain every day."
This is good news, guaranteed.
I bet your lunch.
Okay.
Come on.
You are fired.
Oh, I'm sorry.
KORBEN:
Well...
At least I won lunch.
Good philosophy.
See good in bad. I like.
Hello.
WOMAN: Korben, sweetheart.
You got broken fingers?
You can't punch my number?
Hi, Mom.
Seventeen messages.
And don't tell me your machine
is broken again. Those things
are good for 1000 years.
Mr. Kim, you should go.
This is gonna take a minute.
You wouldn't even feed your
white pussycat a croquette, who
you obviously love more than me.
But she didn't breast-feed you. I did.
Goodbye, Mr. Dallas.
Ah, fortune for you.
--which is hard enough on me.
Oh, Christ, I'll never be
a grandmother.
MR. KIM: It bring you good luck!
Yeah, sure.
Korben, you know how
my poor body's failing me.
You have to take me on this trip.
Ma, what are you talking about?
I get it. You wanna make
your only mother beg. Is that it?
No, I don't want to make you beg.
All I want is an explanation.
Look, I just got in.
I just smashed my cab.
I lost my job. I got mugged.
Besides that, everything's peachy.
Thanks for asking.
Now, will you just settle down
and explain this to me calmly.
Oh, so you don't know you won
a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two
for 10 days.
And I suppose you're just gonna
leave me on the lunar surface
to freeze my ass off.
If I'd have won a trip,
I'd know about it. Somebody
would've notified me.
Korben, they've been blaring
your name out on the radio
for the last hour, you big ape.
Ma, I'll call you back.
General Munro, how nice
to see you in the 5000 block.
Nice apartment, major.
Looks like you settled
into a wonderful life.
Heard you lost your job.
You heard that, huh?
Well, don't worry.
I'll get another job.
Don't bother.
We have one for you.
"Major Dallas, you've been
selected for a mission
of the utmost importance."
What mission?
To save the world.
"You leave immediately
for Fhloston Paradise.
Retrieve four stones from the diva
Plavalaguna and bring them back
with the utmost discretion possible."
Any questions?
Yeah, just one. Why me?
I retired six months ago,
you remember?
Three reasons.
One, as a member of the
Elite Special Forces Unit
of the federated army,
you are an expert in the use
of all weapons and spacecraft
needed for this mission.
Two, of all the members of your unit,
you're the most highly decorated.
And the third one?
Of all the members of your unit,
you're the only one left alive.
You check your messages?
No, I've had enough
good news for one day.
Might be important.
RECORDED VOICE:
You're a winner!
You've won the annual
Gemini Contest and a trip
to Fhloston Paradise for two.
Here are your tickets.
You rigged the contest?
Uh-huh.
Congratulations.
You couldn't think of anything
a little more discreet, huh?
Old tricks are the best tricks, eh?
Major Iceborg will
accompany you as your wife.
I am not going.
Why not?
Excuse me, general.
Who is it? Who is it?
My wife.
You remarried?
Yes. No. I just met this girl,
but I'm gonna marry her.
I love her,
but she hates the military.
She knows that the military
ruined my last marriage.
She can't have anything
to do with it. If she sees
you guys here, she'll kill me.
Major--
Look, you gotta hide somewhere.
You gotta help me.
You just gotta hide somewhere.
We'd love to help, but there's
only one door, where can we hide?
Major, we don't have time for this.
It's just for one minute.
You have no idea
how much you're helping me.
No idea-- You have no idea.
I'm going to be happily married.
Major! Major! Major!
What?
The three of us won't fit in there.
Sure you will.
MUNRO:
Major!
You're on my foot.
Major! Major!
Hi.
I'm really sorry to have to resort
to these methods, Mr. Wallace--
Dallas.
Dallas.
We heard about your good luck
on the radio, and we need your
tickets for Fhloston.
Is this the way priests
usually take vacations?
We're not going on a vacation.
We're on a mission.
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world,
my son.
You're gonna save the world?
Yes!
Down there. Down there.
MALE VOICE :
This is a police control.
This is not an exercise.
Come on, get in.
One minute, all right?
Just stay here for one minute,
I promise.
This is a police control.
Don't touch anything.
This is not an exercise.
Can you please spread your legs
and place your hands
in the yellow circles.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna save your ass
so you can save the world.
Yeah, but l--
I think this is the door.
There's no name and no number.
Let's see it.
Sir, are you classified
as human?
Negative. I am a meat Popsicle.
I found him.
OFFICER :
Mr. Korben Dallas?
Sir, can you put your hands
in the yellow circles, please?
Smoke you !
Wrong answer.
MALE VOICE :
The police control is now terminated.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.
Okay, we got the guy.
Wasn't easy, but we bagged him.
Thanks for the tip.
Glad to be of help, my friend.
The guy's just been arrested
for uranium smuggling.
Everything's going as planned.
All I have to do now is go
to the airport, take his place,
and I'll be in Fhloston
in less than four hours.
Don't come back
without the stones.
Korben Dallas. We got him.
Perfect.
Akanit, take command.
Go to Fhloston
and get the stones.
If Zorg really wants them,
he'll have to negotiate.
Revenge is at hand.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I forgot about the autowash.
There's an autowash
in that shower.
I'm so sorry.
Autowash.
Autowash, yes.
Autowash, in the shower.
You know, it's funny.
I've met you twice today.
Both times,
you've ended up in my arms.
It's my lucky day.
Lucky day.
Yeah.
Did you hear something?
Cornelius.
Autowash.
I'm so sorry. Sorry.
I don't need your help.
Want a cup of coffee?
Yes, please.
Autowash.
Coffee's not really my specialty.
But you must drink a lot
of coffee, being a priest, huh?
No, I know. I'm not proud
of what I did. I had no choice.
I'll take the mission.
Did you get them?
Yeah, I got them.
Good.
"Leeloo Dallas."
"Multi-pass."
"Korben David Dallas." Perfect.
No, no. I can't possibly be
your husband. I'm too old.
Now, David is...
in great shape.
He'll protect you.
Now, please, go to the diva,
collect the stones and meet
me at the temple.
Now. Yes.
Okay.
WOMAN :
Final call for Fhloston Paradise.
Last call for Fhloston Paradise.
Hurry up.
Uh...
The tickets.
ID, please.
I'm sorry.
There.
In here?
FEMALE VOICE:
Thank you!
Mr. Dallas?
Uh... Yeah.
Congratulations on winning
the contest.
Oh, right. Okay.
Sorry for the mess.
The mess?
The garbage.
Oh, right-- It's K--
Whoo! Made it!
I was so afraid
I wasn't gonna make this flight,
so I sent David here to come
and pick up my boarding pass.
But, um--
But now David has to go.
Thank you. Bye.
I am Korben Dallas.
WOMAN :
Please report infractions
immediately to the spaceport.
And this is?
Leeloo Dallas. Multi-pass.
Yeah. Lee-- Multi-pass.
Multi-pass.
She knows it's a multi-pass.
Leeloo Dallas.
My wife. We're newlyweds.
Just met. You know how it is.
Bump into each other,
sparks happen-- Yeah,
she knows it's a multi-pass.
Yeah. Anyway, we're in love.
I mean, I know
she's made to be strong.
She's also so fragile, so human.
You know what I mean?
ROBOT: Do you want some more?
Yeah.
Make that two.
Oh, David. David?
Where's Leeloo?
She's on the plane with Mr. Dallas.
What?!
I'm sorry, Father.
I didn't know what to do.
I thought he was gonna kill me.
But this is not possible.
This is not possible.
ROBOT:
You want some more?
This is all my fault.
I am the servant. It is my mission.
I shouldn't have given it to you.
I know.
Here's the key to the temple.
Oh, no.
Prepare for our arrival.
I go to face my destiny. Yes.
I don't want to go to Egypt.
FEMALE VOICE:
Thank you!
Dallas? Korben Dallas?
Yeah, that's me.
Just a minute, please.
It will take just one more minute.
We'll be right back.
Oh, Mr. Dallas. Oh, um,
we really need you right now.
Ruby Rhod is broadcasting live
and he needs you for an interview.
Miss?
Multi-pass.
Tell Aknot that plan A flopped.
Go to plan B.
Aliens ahead. Spread out.
Backup unit, zone 18.
Mr. Ruby Rhod is the biggest
radio star, you know. It's a great
honour to be on his talk show.
He's so green.
Yes, I'm sure you're very excited.
But I'm on my vacation
and I don't want to be bothered.
I prefer to remain anonymous.
Korben Dallas!
Here he is! The one and only winner
of the Gemini Croquette Contest.
This boy is fuelled like fire,
so start melting, ladies,
because the boy is hotter than hot.
He's hot, hot, hot!
The right size, the right build,
the right hair, the right on.
MALE VOICE:
Right on, right on.
Right on, right on.
And he's got something to say
to those 50 billion pairs
of ears out there.
Pop it, D-man.
Um, hi.
Unbelievable.
Quiver, ladies, quiver.
He's gonna set the world on fire.
Right here from 5 to 7.
You'll know everything
there is to know about the D-man.
His dreams,
his desires,
his most intimates of intimates.
And from what I'm looking at, intimate
is this studmuffin's middle name.
So tell me, my man,
you nervous in the service?
Not really.
Freeze those knees, my chilies,
because Korben's in the place
and he's on the case.
Yesterday's frog
will be tomorrow's prince
of Fhloston Paradise!
The hotel of a thousand and one
follies, lollies and lick-them-lollies.
A magic fountain flow
of non-stop wine, women
and hootchie-kootchie-koo
all night long.
Ooh.
Start licking your stamps, little
girlies, because this guy's gonna
have you writing home to Mama.
Right, here, from 5 to 7,
I'll be your voice, your tongue,
and I'll be hot on the trail
of the sexiest man of the year:
D-man, your man...
my man.
MAN :
End of transmission.
WOMAN :
Okay, Ruby. See you tomorrow at 5.
How was it?
Oh ! Wow.
Oh !
It was just
absolutely green.
Green like what?
Crystal green.
Any kind of green you want,
tree green, emerald, pond green.
Korben, sweetheart, what was that?
It was bad ! It had nothing !
No fire! No energy! No nothing !
You know I have a show to run here.
You know? Hm? Hm?
And it must pop, pop, pop!
So tomorrow, from 5 to 7,
will you please act like you have
more than a two-word vocabulary.
It must be green !
Okay? Okay?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Can I just talk to you?
I didn't come here to play
Pumba on the radio.
So tomorrow, from 5 to 7,
you're gonna give yourself a hand.
Green?
Super-green.
Dallas? Korben Dallas?
That's me.
Listen, I only have one Korben
Dallas on my list, and he's
already checked in, okay?
That's impossible.
I am Korben Dallas.
Sorry, sir. Boarding is finished.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hey, hey, hey!
I need to talk to someone!
I don't believe this!
MALE VOICE :
This is not an exercise.
This is a police control.
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm calm.
Put your hands in the yellow circles.
There's been a mistake.
There's been a mistake.
To make your flight
as short as possible,
our flight attendants are switching
on the sleep regulator,
which will regulate your sleeping
during the flight.
Thank you.
Hi.
Oh, you speak English now.
Yes. I learn.
Good.
Leeloo, we are not on vacation.
I'm on a mission, a very
important mission. I work for
some very important people.
If I hadn't come to get you,
you would be in big trouble.
Do you understand that?
Do you understand? Big trouble?
Yes.
But you, no trouble.
Me, fifth element.
Supreme being.
Me protect you.
Sleep.
Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas.
No, wait--
Sleep regulator operative
in zone one, captain.
Thank you.
Zone two, are you operative?
Zone two?
Yeah, everything's ready,
captain.
Mr. Rhod.
What?
You're gonna have to assume
your individual position.
I don't want one position,
I want all positions!
Mr. Rhod !
Parasites in landing gear.
Ground, you copy?
Got it. Front gear.
Hey, man, give me
some heat, man !
We need some heat here, man !
Give me some heat!
Some heat over here, man !
Good shit, man.
Put the heat over here, man !
Thank you !
Thank you very much !
Come, come, come, come.
Give me this. Give me this.
Take that.
Mr. Rhod !
You can call me Ruby.
Fuelled and ready to go.
Yep.
I'll buy you one, man.
ZORG:
Have you taken off already?
I'm not on the plane.
What?
The real Dallas took my place.
I don't understand.
Are you making fun of me?
No, no, no! I swear! I swear!
I never felt this way before
with a human.
Really?
Yeah !
I've tried everything, sir, believe me.
There's no other way of getting on
this plane.
Ground is clear.
Roger. Ready for lift-off?
Confirmed.
Not there. No, please, not there.
Please, not there.
Power pressure?
Primed.
Protection?
Confirmed.
PILOT:
Power increase.
Ten seconds.
I am...
a little...
disappointed.
Five...
And if there is one thing
I do not like...

Sorry, sir. This will
never happen again.
I know.
lift-off.
Landing gear secure.
Roger. Checklist for light speed.
Sir, we're finally getting something.
It's sending radio wavelengths.
What does it want with radio waves?
Maybe it wants to make a call.
Zorg's office.
I told you I did not want
to be disturbed.
I know you don't want to be disturbed
except if it's Mr. Shadow,
and it's Mr. Shadow on the line.
SHADOW:
It's Shadow again.
Zorg here.
Am I disturbing you?
No, no, no, no, I was just--
Where are you?
SHADOW:
Not far now.
Good.
Good, good.
How are the stones?
Fine. Fine. Just fine.
I'll have the...
I'll have the four stones
that you asked for any time now,
but it wasn't easy.
My costs have tripled.
Money is of no importance.
I want the stones.
The stones...
will be here.
I'll see to it personally.
I will be among you
soon.
We lost it.
We lost the signal.
Damn !
WOMAN :
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've begun our descent
toward Fhloston Paradise.
The local time is 3:20 p.m.
Auto-temperature is currently
We do hope that you've enjoyed
your flight for today and hope
to see you again soon.
MAN :
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to paradise.
Excuse me, dear. Excuse me.
Thank you. Excuse me, please.
Wow.
Parasites in main ventilation.
Again? Don't worry, I'll get it.
Aah !
Have we arrived yet?
Yeah.
Oh, good.
We have 12 swimming pools
and two on the rooftop.
All the restaurants are between
level two and level 10.
The planet Fhloston has 400
beaches, all accessible until 5 p. m.
Then the airship goes higher
to offer you a better view
with your dinner.
Is the diva here yet?
Not yet.
Are there any tickets left
for this opera? I'm a really big fan.
You have a seat reserved,
front row,
next to Ruby Rhod !
He's so talented, don't you think?
I just love him. He's so sexy.
Well, anyway, he has your ticket
for the show, and he'll be here
in 20 minutes.
Do you know where I can
get something to wear?
Enjoy your evening, Mr. Dallas.
Thank you.
Hello?
MRS. DALLAS :
You miserable bastard,
I never should've pushed you out.
Ma?
I was in labour for days
and this is how you repay me?
I should've just gotten a robot.
Come on, Ma.
Don't "come on, Ma" me.
I should be there, not you.
I need a tan. I need a cocktail.
Ma...
:
Get the case in.
:
Hello, Ms. Diva. I'm Fog.
Welcome to the--
I am, uh, security.
Welcome to the-- Tall...
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure. Yeah.
MANAGER: What's your name?
FOG: Fog.
Ms. Plavalaguna wants you to know
how glad she is that you're here.
She'll give you what you've
come to get after the concert.
Stay here.
MAN :
You're listening to Radio Cosmos
and it is now 5 p.m.
Helm to 108.
Yes, sir.
Helm 108!
Helm to 108.
MAN :

and Korben Dallas,
the lucky winner
of the Gemini Croquette Contest.
Coming at you
live from Fhloston...
Paradise!
Ruby Rhod at your service for
two hours with lucky Korben and the
manager of this super-green hotel
and Miss Gemini Croquette
in person
and 8000 other lucksters here
to enjoy the privilege of the unique
concert of Miss Plavalaguna!
Bzzz!
And now we enter
what must be
the most beautiful concert hall
in all the universe!
A perfect replica
of the old opera house...
but who cares?
To my right, a row of ministers,
more sinisters than ministers.
To my left, Baby Ray,
star of stage and screen.
He's not gonna get much out of this
concert, because he's stone-deaf!
To who?
And here we have Roy Von Baker,
king of laser ball.
And here, the Emperor
of Kodar Japhet and his
lovely daughter.
"I love to sing,"
she recently confessed to me.
By the way, I have a recording
of her talented voice.
I'll play you the rest of the song
after the concert, because right now
it's time for Korben to say
the word of the day.
So tell me, my man, you happy
here in the big world?
Thrilled.
And now champagne!
Commercial !
Commercial !
MAN :
Break for 30 seconds.
Bzzz!
Showtime.
TCHAKO'S ARIA OF
Commander, I have a ship in
trouble requesting permission
to dock for repairs.
Put him in the docking garage.
Inform security.
Sir.
MAN :
Permission granted for one hour.
More than I need.
Yes?
MAN:
Champagne for the diva.
I'll take it.
I found it.
Get her!
It was an ambush.
If it's war they want,
it's war they'll get!
Bravo! Bravo!
My compliments, little lady.
Thank you for doing all the
dirty work. I couldn't have done
a better job myself.
Hand over the stones.
Nobody move!
We're taking over the ship!
Hands up!
Ruby! Ruby!
I know this music.
Let's change the beat.
Ladies and gentlemen,
something's happening here.
I think we're being attacked.
I don't know who they are,
but they're everywhere.
Wait a minute.
I see one of them.
They're warriors, and they're ugly.
They got big teeth and they
got big foreheads and big ears,
and they stink.
Mangalores.
KORBEN: The government sent me
to help you. Just stay calm.
If somebody hears this, come
and get me. I'm in the first row.
You must give her the stones.
Who?
The fifth element.
The supreme being sent to Earth
to save the universe.
Leeloo?
Yes.
But she's more fragile
than she seems.
She needs your help...
and your love...
or she will die.
No, no, no. Stay with me.
Help!
If you want something done,
do it yourself.
Come on, honey. You can't die.
Come on. Listen to me. Wake up!
Where are the stones?
What?
The stones. Where are the stones?
The stones.
They're not here.
The stones, where are they?
In me.
What? What?
Oh, my God, Korben.
Oh, my God, Korben, Korben.
Korben, another one coming.
Korben. Korben,
I think we should go.
One minute. One minute.
Just give me a minute.
MANGALORE:
Hey, you !
I said, you.
I'm not with him.
Where's the other?
I said, one minute.
Ruby, hold this gun.
What? What do you want me to do?
Hold this gun.
Come on. Put your hand on it.
Oh, my God.
Got it? Hold it.
What do I do?
If he moves, squeeze the trigger.
I don't feel right.
I don't feel right, Korben.
The stones are "in me."
Korben, I got a headache.
This ain't me.
Ruby--
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
Think he's gonna be okay?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Korben.
Another one coming.
Aw, shit. Three coming, Korben.
Three.
Listen, you guard this with your life,
or you're gonna look like this guy
right here. You green?
Green.
KORBEN: Super-green?
RUBY: Super-green.
Is that your idea
of a discreet operation?
Don't worry, sir. I know my man.
He'll calm things down.
All right.
Move! Move!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies
and gentlemen, this is amazing.
Let me do it.
Right.
Oh, my God. Korben Dallas,
Korben, my man.
Korben Dallas is in trouble.
Hey. Ray!
The gun !
Give me the gun. The gun.
The gun !
I'm gonna go and try
to see if I can see
something a little closer.
Yes, the gun. Yeah.
Thanks, Ray.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! I'm not armed !
Get up!
You've got the wrong guy!
Don't shoot!
I'm not armed ! I'm not armed !
Oh, my God.
KORBEN:
I'm on vacation.
It's-- Don't shoot me, please.
I'm on a vacation. I won a...
contest.
Gemini Croquette's to
Fhloston Paradise.
Down.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Get down !
I think he's trying to say
something to me.
Get down !
Sorry. Sorry, my man.
Korben. Korben?
Where are you, man?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Korben.
They're coming.
Korben, they're coming.
Korben !
Don't move.
What?
What you doing?
Count to 10.
Korben? Was that a bomb?
Just shut up and count!
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight...
nine...
Ten.
I am very disappointed !
Korben, my man. Korben,
what are you looking for?
Control room.
This is it.
I'll be over here, all right?
Let's go! Let's go!
Quiet! Quiet!
You in charge?
Yeah.
How many of them
are out there?
I don't know.
Let's count.
Seven on the left.
Five on the right.
Four on the right. Two on the left.
We need to find the leader.
Mangalores won't fight without
the leader.
One more shot and we start
killing hostages.
That's the leader.
Send someone to negotiate.
l-- l-- l-- l--
I've never negotiated.
You mind if I try?
No, no. Sure, sure. Sure.
We're sending somebody in
to negotiate!
Anybody else wanna negotiate?
Where did he learn
to negotiate like that?
I wonder.
Where's Ruby?
I thought he was dead.
Master!
It was nothing, really.
It was just a helping hand.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Ruby Rhod,
still alive. Aah !
What's wrong with you? It hurt!
Wow. Zoom.
Korben, I realize that you
must be pretty mad at me,
but I want you to know that
I am fighting for a noble cause.
Yes, you're trying to save
the world. I remember.
Right now, I'm trying
to save Leeloo, Father.
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is Leeloo not in trouble?
There. Where is that?
MAN: That's the diva's suite.
Leeloo.
Leeloo. Hang on.
Here, come on. How the hell do you
get yourself into these positions?
Come on.
Yeah, I'm here. It's all right.
It's all right. Everything's okay now.
Listen.
I got the stones. All right,
just take it easy, all right?
My man, my man, my man.
What's this thing
with all these numbers?
It's-- It's--
No, no, no, no.
Because if it was a bomb,
the alarms would go off
because all these hotels
have bomb detectors. Right?
WOMAN :
This is a Type A alert.
For security reasons,
the hotel must be evacuated.
Please proceed calmly
to the lifeboats
Stay calm !
located in the main hallways.
Please, stay calm !
Korben. Korben, my man,
you know how to stop this, right?
Korben?
WOMAN :
Two minutes to complete evacuation.
Get back!
Evacuation ! Evacuation !
Sorry, sir, you can't stay here.
There's a bomb in the hotel.
I know.
RUBY: I don't want to die.
Please, my son.
Get in. Get in.
WOMAN :
One minute to total evacuation.
This one.
Forty-five seconds.
KORBEN:
Get her strapped in.
Korben, Korben. Korben, my man,
you know how to fly this thing?
Just like driving a cab.
But the door?
How we gonna get out the door?
Fifteen seconds.
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five...
For the honour.
Oh, no.
You should hold on.
Come on.
Like driving a cab.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is now 7 p. m. Time for the news.
See you tomorrow
for a new adventure.
MAN :
End of transmission.
That's the best show I ever did.
Mr. President, Major Dallas
has the five elements on board,
and the priest is guiding them
directly to the temple.
We're saved.
The diva said that
I should take care of you.
Humans act so strange.
What do you mean?
Everything you created
is used to destroy.
Yeah.
We call it human nature.
You learn about that on your screen?
I'm not finished yet.
I'm up to V.
V is good.
Some very good words in V.
Like what?
Valiant.
Vulnerable.
Very beautiful.
PRESIDENT:
Oh, of course, Munro!
Mr. President?
Yes, now what?
l-- l--
We have a problem.
What do you mean
it's advancing?
It's not only advancing,
it's moving at incredible speed.
We're having trouble following it.
And do you have any idea
where it's heading?
Korben, there's a general
on the phone.
I'll give you to the president.
Major Dallas, I first would like
to salute a warrior.
You're a shining example
of this army's might.
Mr. President. Mr. President.
In the name of the Federation
and its territories--
Any idea when you're gonna be
getting to the point?
Okay. There's a ball of fire
heading straight for Earth,
and we have no idea how
to stop it. That's the problem.
How much time do we have?
If its speed remains constant,
in an hour and 57 minutes.
I'll call you back in two hours.
Hello? Hello? Hello?
They just landed in the desert.
CORNELIUS:
Good job, David.
Put her in the centre.
Where? Here?
You got it figured out, Father?
This one should be fire.
You know how all this works?
Theoretically, yes.
Theoretically?
The four stones should go around.
The fifth element should be
in the middle,
and then the weapon
against evil should work.
You've never seen this
work before, have you?
No.
Every weapon has a manual.
I'm sure this has one too.
That's it. That's it.
Match up the symbols. Go! Go!
Wind.
My man, what you doing?
What?
What you doing?
Trying to keep you
in the DJ business.
Fire.
Done.
So, what happens now?
So now, we have to open them.
And you know how to do that, right?
Theoretically...
no.
No.
Leeloo, wake up, honey, wake up.
You have to help us.
Leeloo. How do you open
these stones?
Wind blows.
Fire burns.
Yes, I know all that.
But how do you open these stones?
Rain...
falls.
Leeloo. Leeloo.
What does it mean?
I think that--
Maybe it's a charade.
What?
A game or something.
If we don't get these stones open
in five minutes, we're all dead.
Dead?
Yes, dead.
Too late.
We've lost contact with them.
Three minutes.
I think mine is broken.
Why I gotta get the broke one?
We're never gonna make it.
Korben. Korben, it moved !
What'd you do?
Show me what you did.
Nothing.
Shut up, shut up!
Shut up! Calm down. Show me
what you did. Take me through it,
step by step.
I was just standing here like this.
Quickly.
Okay, and I put my hands on
the top like this, and I said:
"We're not gonna make it."
That's it?
RUBY:
Korben, my man.
Wind.
She said, "Wind-- Wind blows."
Everyone take a stone.
Water for water. Fire for fire.
Earth for earth. Go, now!
Earth.
Open the other one.
Okay...
K-- Korben.
Korben, my man, I have no fire.
I have no matches.
Do you have any matches?
I stopped smoking. If I knew--
I mean-- Father, you smoke?
Got some matches? Matches?
We need some fire.
We all gonna die.
Don't breathe.
Fire.
One minute.
KORBEN:
Let's go. Let's go. Leeloo.
Wake up. Wake up.
It's time for you to work now.
Protect life...
until death.
No, no, Leeloo! Listen to me!
Listen to me. Listen.
Listen, I know you're very tired.
I know you're very tired.
I'll take you on a vacation when
we're done. I swear, a real vacation.
A real vacation, just you and me.
But listen to me, if you don't do
something right now, we're all
gonna die. You understand?
What's the use of saving life
when you see what you do with it?
It'll be entering the atmosphere
in 40 seconds.
KORBEN: Leeloo, you're right.
You're right, you're right.
But there are some things,
very nice things worth saving,
some beautiful things.
Beautiful things.
Like love?
Yes, love.
That's good. That's good.
That's a good example.
Like love. Love is worth saving.
I don't know love.
I was built to protect,
not to love.
So there's no use for me
other than this.
No, no, no, you're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.
I need you. I need you, very much.
Why?
Because...
Tell her, Korben.
Tell me. Please.
Why do you need me?
Because...
Tell me.
Tell me.
Because l--
Because I love you.
I love you.
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three,
two, one.
MAN :
Scanner imaging has confirmed
the dark planet: dead.
The planet seems to have stopped
at 62 miles from impact.
Yes!
What's wrong with you?
What you screaming for?
Every five minutes,
it's something.
A bomb or something.
I'm leaving. Bzz!
Mr. President.
Let me introduce you to
Professor Mactilburgh
who runs the centre.
It's an honour to receive you,
Mr. President.
Yes, well...
Where are my two heroes?
Oh, they were so tired from their
ordeal, we put them in the reactor
this morning.
I have 19 more meetings
after this one, professor.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Let me see if they're revived.
Thank you.
We go live in one minute,
Mr. President.
Mm-hm.
Ah...
They're...
not ready.
They need...
five more minutes.
You have 20 seconds.
No, ma'am. No, no,
I tried. No, ma'am.
Who's that?
Some woman. Claims
to be Korben's mother.
Well, give it here.
Mrs. Dallas, this is the president.
On behalf of the Federation--
MRS. DALLAS :
Oh, please, that doesn't even
sound like him.
The president's an idiot.
You don't sound like an idiot.
If you don't want to talk
to your mother, just avoid me
like usual, huh?
I'll just throw myself in traffic.
I'll just Saran Wrap myself to the bed
and pretend my child...
