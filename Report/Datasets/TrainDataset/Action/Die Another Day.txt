PUKCH'ONG COAST, NORTH KOREA
Look, what is this? I'm supposed to--
Colonel Tan-Sun Moon's H.Q.
De-Mllitarised Zone
North Korea
Open the bag.
That will teach you to lecture me.
Retract the blast doors.
Find me a new anger therapist.
I am Zao.
You are late.
Mr. Van Bierk. I've been looking
forward to this meeting.
Me too.
My African mllitary friends owe you
many thanks, Colonel Moon.
Few men have the guts to trade
confllct diamonds since the U.N. embargo.
I know all about the U.N.
I studied at Oxford and Harvard.
Majored in Western hypocrisy.
From your modest collection of cars,
I wouldn't have guessed.
Show me the diamonds.
Show me the weapons.
Bring the weapons.
Hiding weapons
in the de-mllitarised zone.
-It's a bit of a minefield out there.
-America's cultural contribution.
One mllllon landmines. And
my hovercrafts float right over them.
RPGs, flamethrowers,
automatic weapons...
...and enough ammunition to run
a small war.
My diamonds?
Check it over quick.
Don't blow it all at once.
I have special plans
for this consignment.
His name is James Bond,
a British assassin.
Mr. Van Bierk,
let me show you something.
Our new tank buster.
Depleted uranium shells, naturally.
Naturally.
And how do you propose to kill me now,
Mr. Bond?
It's pathetic that you British still believe
you have the right to police the world.
You will not llve to see the day
all Korea is ruled by the North.
Then you and I have something
in common.
Who is it?
Where's my son?
It's the General.
Hello...Father.
Why is there a fire?
I'll be there in five minutes.
Get the weapons out of here.
...and kill the spy.
Saved by the bell.
My son is dead.
I don't condone what they do here.
I don't condone what they do here.
Tell it to the concierge.
Still you jest.
Defiant to the last.
Your people have abandoned you.
Your very existence denied.
Why stay sllent?
It doesn't matter anymore.
Things are out of my hands.
We reach the end, Mr. Bond.
Spare me the unpleasantries.
Spare me the unpleasantries.
Fifty years after the superpowers
carved Korea in two...
...and then you arrive.
A British spy, an assassin.
And now the hard-llners have
their proof.
We cannot trust the West.
You....
You took away my son.
Your firing squad should have done
the job for me.
I hoped a Western education
would help him become a bridge...
...between our worlds.
But all it did was to corrupt him.
Let's get this over with, shall we?
My son had an ally in the West.
For the last time, who was it?
Who made him betray his country
and name?
The same person who betrayed me.
Turn around.
Start walking.
Start walking.
Keep walking, please.
Keep moving.
Zao.
I'm being traded...
...for you.
Keep moving. Keep walking, please.
Your time will come.
Not as soon as yours.
Keep walking, please.
Look at him.
Double check.
You'd think he was some kind
of a hero.
-Reference nine.
-Sir.
Section four.
Okay, hold him tight. Got him.
Watch his legs now.
All right, let's go.
No biological agents in the prelim scan.
He's clean.
Pulse, 7 2. Blood pressure, 1 20/80.
lndications of neurotoxins, histamine,
serotonin and enzyme inhibitors.
Scorpion venom.
Note also traces of a venom antiserum.
They'd sting him
then administer the antidote.
Yet his internal organs seem unaffected.
Liver not too good.
lt's definitely him then.
Morning.
Welcome back.
Such hospitallty.
You don't seem too pleased to see me.
If I'd had my way, you'd still be
in North Korea.
Your freedom came at too high a price.
Zao.
He tried to blow up a summit
between South Korea and China.
Took out three Chinese agents
before he was caught.
And now he's free.
I never asked to be traded.
I'd rather die than let him loose.
-You had cyanide.
-Threw it away years ago. What is this?
The top American agent...
...in the North Korean High Command
was executed a week ago.
The Americans intercepted a signal
from your prison naming him.
-And they think it's me?
-You were the only inmate.
They concluded you cracked
and were hemorrhaging information.
We had to get you out.
And what do you think?
With the drugs they gave you,
you wouldn't know what you said.
I know the rules.
And number one is, no deals.
Get caught and you're given up.
The mission was compromised.
Moon got a call exposing me.
He had a partner in the West.
Even his father knew.
-Whether that's true or not, it's irrelevant.
-No, it isn't.
The same person who set me up then
set me up to get Zao out.
So I'm going after him.
You're going to our evaluation center
in the Falklands.
Double-O status rescinded.
Along with my freedom?
For as long as I deem necessary, yes.
You're no use to anyone now.
-He's in cardiac arrest.
-Get the crash cart. Notify his superiors.
-He's flat-llning on the ECG.
-Stand by.
Two hundred joules.
Three hundred.
Get me some atropine.
We're losing him! Stand by. Clear.
I'm checking out.
Thanks for the kiss of llfe.

Security breach on level three.
All personnel, defensive code red.
Apprehend and detain with force.
Security breach on level three.
All personnel, defensive code red.
My goodness, standards are falling.
No tie, dear me.
My usual suite, please.
Do you have a credit card?
Or even any luggage, sir?
Mr. Bond, so good to see you.
-It's been a long time.
-Mr. Chang.
Open the Presidential Suite.
Send up my tallor. And some food.
The lobster's good, with qualls'
eggs and sllced seaweed.
-And if there's any left, a '61 Bollinger.
-Of course.
Do it...quickly.
Been busy, have we, Mr. Bond?
Just surviving, Mr. Chang.
Just surviving.
I am PeacefuI Fountains of Desire,
the masseuse.
I come with compllments
of the manager.
I'm sure you do. Come in.
On the bed, pIease. Face down.
Yes, of course.
I'm not that kind of masseuse.
I'm not that kind of customer.
You think I haven't aIways known
you're Chinese Intelligence, Chang?
-Hong Kong is our turf now.
-Don't worry about it.
I'm not here to take it back.
Put your hands down.
What the hell do you want?
Just to heIp you settIe a score.
Zao kllIed three of your men.
You get me into North Korea,
I'll take care of him for you.
What's in it for you?
Chance to get even.
Zao has information I need.
-I'll have to ask Beijing.
-Do it.
Now get out.
UnIess you really wanna give
me a massage.
Mr. Bond.
A llttIe thank-you from us.
Cuba?
It seems Mr. Zao has Iost himseIf
in Havana.
If you find him, say goodbye from us.
With pIeasure.
HAVANA
I'm here to pick up
some DeIectados.
DeIectados? We haven't made
DeIectados in 30 years.
UniversaI Exports.
Check with your boss.
RaouI....
UniversaI Exports.
Follow me.
Your passport, senor.
I'd come to think the DeIectados
wouId never be smoked.
They are particuIarIy hazardous
for one's heaIth, Mr...?
Bond.
Mr. Bond.
Do you know why?
It's the addition
of the VoIado tobacco.
SIow burning.
It never goes out.
Just llke a sIeeper.
Sorry for the rude awakening.
I Iove my country.
I'd never ask you
to betray your peopIe.
-I'm after a North Korean.
-A tourist?
A terrorist.
One man's terrorist is
another man's freedom fighter.
Zao has no interest
in other peopIe's freedom.
I stllI have some friends
in high pIaces.
Favors called in.
Some dollars spread about.
We find your friend is here,
on an isIand.
In Los Organos.
There is a strange cllnic
run by Dr. AIvarez.
He Ieads the fieId in gene therapy.
Increasing the llfe expectancy
of our beIoved Ieaders.
And, of course,
the richest Westerners.
We may have Iost our freedom
in the revoIution...
...but we have a heaIth system
second to none.
You didn't do too badIy
out of the revoIution.
We all have our ways
of getting by.
You'd be surprised how many
government officiaIs come to me...
-...for reminders of the decadent times.
-Yeah, well....
-Mind if I borrow these?
-PIease.
My sources tell me
this Zao is very dangerous.
I wish I couId give you more heIp.
I couId use a fast car.
Mojito, por favor.
Mr. Krug, your admittance papers
for the AIvarez Cllnic.
About bIoody time, FideI.
Round up more girIs
and take them to room 42.
UnIess you want to be known
as FideI Castrato.
Magnificent view.
It is, isn't it?
Too bad it's Iost on everybody eIse.
Mojito?
You shouId try it.
Giacinta Johnson.
My friends call me Jinx.
My friends call me James Bond.
Jinx, you say?
Born on Friday the 1 3th.
Do you belleve in bad Iuck?
Let's just say my reIationships
don't seem to Iast.
I know the feellng.
The predators
usually appear at sunset.
And why is that?
It's when their prey
comes out to drink.
Too strong for you?
I couId Iearn to llke it.
If I had the time.
How much time have you got?
Untll dawn. What about you?
I'm just here for the birds.
OrnithoIogist.
OrnithoIogist, huh?
Now there's a mouthfuI.
So you're gonna be busy tonight
with the owIs then?
No owIs in Los Organos.
Nothing to see tllI the morning.
Not out there anyway.
So, what do predators do...
...when the sun goes down?
They feast...
...llke there's no tomorrow.
Are you aIways this frisky?
I've been missing the touch
of a good woman.
Who says I'm good?
What do you want?
-I don't need a wheeIchair.
-No?
You do now.
Senor.
-Okay.
-Gracias.
IsIa Los Organos
So you are to have
DNA-repIacement therapy.
Let me expIain the two phases.
First, we kllI off your bone marrow.
Wipe the DNA sIate cIean.
Phase two:
Introduction of new DNA
harvested from heaIthy donors.
Orphans, runaways...
...peopIe that won't be missed.
I llke to think of myseIf
as an artist.
And this is when I create.
Thank you.
It is a painfuI process,
I'm afraid, but...
...all great art is.
I'll certainIy enjoy working on you.
Of course, most artists
are onIy truIy appreciated...
...after they're dead.
My father was a sergeant.
We lived in Hampshire.
l have fond memories
of the countryside.
Good.
Got your attention.
Who's bankrolling
your makeover, Zao?
Same person who set me up
in North Korea?
James? What's going on?
Jinx, you gotta get out of here now!
Move! Move!
Move it!
Let's go!
You see, my friend,
the chemicaI composition shows...
...this is from Sierra Leone.
Confllct diamonds.
There's some kind
of marking here.
-''GG.''
-Let me see.
Yes.
From the Graves Corporation
in IceIand.
That's his Iaser signature.
A man called Gustav Graves
discovered diamonds there...
...a year or so ago.
Yet they're identicaI
to confllct diamonds.
What an amazing coincidence.
How can he escape
from a British warship...
...in the middle of Hong Kong
harbor, right under your nose?
-Interesting station, Moneypenny?
-I got a storm warning.
You were supposed
to throw away the key...
...not leave the door wide open.
Are you impIying I had a hand
in his escape?
Well, Bond got away real fast,
didn't he?
It is what he's trained to do.
Your boy's been very busy.
He torches a clinic in Cuba.
Listen, you put your house in order...
...or we're gonna do it for you.
Your drink, sir.
Lucky I asked for it shaken.
-When's he coming?
-I don't know.
-Looks llke your man won't make it.
-He's right on time.
WonderfuI day to become a knight.
WllI you be using your titIe,
Mr. Graves?
I'm proud of my adopted nation,
but I'd never stand on ceremony.
After that entrance,
you can't be surprised...
...you're called a seIf-publlcizing
adrenallne junkie, can you?
I prefer ''adventurer.''
We've heard about the Icarus
space program. What's the secret?
It's a surprise.
You'll soon be enllghtened.
You work 24l7. Is it true
that you don't need sIeep?
You get one shot at llfe.
Why waste it on sIeep?
Aren't you trying out for
the OIympic fencing team?
-We hear you're training furiousIy.
-I never get furious.
As they say in fencing,
''What's the point?''
Thank you.
We don't want to keep Her Majesty
waiting any Ionger.
-Mr. Graves.
-Mr. Graves.
Hit.
That's a hit.
Hit.
Verity?
James Bond.
Your Iesson.
I see you handIe your weapon well.
I have been known
to keep my tip up.
Do you mind?
I think I've come undone.
Why not?
Hit. Positions. PIay.
Feast your eyes
on the finest bIade in the cIub.
Gustav Graves?
His publlcist, Miranda Frost.
My protégé.
Gorgeous, isn't she?
She took the goId at Sydney.
-By defauIt, if I remember.
-DefauIt?
The one who beat her
OD'd on steroids.
Miranda deserved that goId.
Now she's teaching Graves
how to win one.
He onIy pIays for cash.
He's won so much,
nobody eIse wants to fight him.
You wanna meet him?
AbsoIuteIy.
Lead on.
-Gustav?
-Verity.
-And Mr...?
-Bond.
James Bond.
-Have we met before?
-I think I'd remember.
Of course you wouId. My mistake.
-Are you a gambllng man, Mr. Bond?
-If the stakes are right.
A thousand a point
too much for you?
Care to pIace a bet, Verity?
No, thanks.
I don't llke cockfights.
Shall we?
Excuse me.
Best of three hits?
Positions.
Ready. PIay.
En garde.
Hit.
Positions.
PIay.
Hit.
Two-nll.
Do you want to continue?
-You wanna up the wager?
-How much can you afford?
Let's pIay for this.
I picked it up in Cuba.
I belleve it's one of yours.
My, my. They do get around.
But then diamonds are for everyone.
Brllllant specimen.
CompIeteIy fIawIess.
And chemically identicaI
to African confllct diamonds.
Then you're about to Iose
something very precious.
Positions.
Ready.
-PIay.
-En garde.
Oh, dear.
You want to continue?
Of course I want to bIoody continue!
But since we're upping the wager...
...Iet's up the weapons,
shall we?
Let's do this the oId-fashioned way.
First bIood drawn from the torso.
That is enough!
It's just a llttIe sport, Miranda.
Seems you beat me, Mr. Bond.
SettIe downstairs, shall we?
You're a rare challenge, Mr. Bond.
I'm putting on a scientific demonstration
in IceIand at the weekend. Icarus?
Perhaps you couId join us.
Miranda, make the arrangements.
Once I've smoothed things over
with the cIub.
What wouId I do without you?
Can I expect the pIeasure of you
in IceIand?
I'm afraid you'll never
have that pIeasure.
Excuse me, Commander Bond.
Someone Ieft this for you.
PIace needed redecorating anyway.
I heard of this pIace.
Never thought I'd find myseIf here.
Some things are best kept underground.
An abandoned station
for abandoned agents.
-Your calling card.
-So, what have you got on Graves?
You burn me...
-...and now you want my heIp?
-Did you expect an apoIogy?
I know you'll do whatever
it takes to get the job done.
-Just llke you.
-The difference is, I won't compromise.
Well, I don't have the Iuxury of
seeing things as bIack and white.
-Whlle you were away, the worId changed.
-Not for me.
You're suspicious of Graves,
or I wouIdn't be here right now.
-So, what do you have?
-Nothing beyond the officiaI biography.
Orphan working in a diamond mine...
...Iearns engineering, makes a huge find
in IceIand and gives haIf of it to charity.
From nothing to everything
in no time at all.
-And his demonstration this weekend?
-ProbabIy just another publlcity stunt.
Tell me what you know
about this Cuban cllnic.
Gene therapy.
New identities courtesy
of DNA transpIants.
So-called ''beauty parIor.'' We'd heard
rumors. I didn't think it really existed.
It doesn't anymore.
Zao got away,
but he Ieft these behind.
All from Gustav Graves' mine.
I think it's a front for Iaundering
African confllct diamonds.
We need to tread carefully.
Graves is polltically connected.
Lucky I'm on the outside, then.
It seems you've become usefuI again.
Then maybe it's time
you Iet me get on with my job.
Forgive my mentioning it,
but a perfect marksman...
...isn't really supposed
to shoot his own boss.
Check the repIay.
You'll find he's dead and
she's onIy got a fIesh wound.
There's aIways an excuse,
isn't there, doubIe-O zero?
Give me the oId firing range any day.
Yes, but it's called the future,
so get used to it.
So this is where they keep
the oId rellcs, then, eh?
This is where our most cutting-edge
technoIogy is deveIoped.
-Point taken.
-Must you touch everything?
Does this stllI work?
-Now, Iook....
-So where is this cutting-edge stuff?
I'm trying to get to it.
Weapon, pIease.
One pane unbreakabIe gIass,
one standard-issue ring finger.
Twist so. Vollà.

-You're cIeverer than you Iook.
-Better than Iooking cIeverer...
...than you are. Follow me.
Now, a new watch.
This wllI be your 20th, I belleve.
-How time flles.
-Yes, well, 007...
...why don't you establlsh a record
by returning this one.
Your new transportation.
-Maybe you've been down here too Iong.
-The uItimate in British engineering.
-You must be joking.
-As I Iearned from my predecessor...
...I never joke about my work.
Aston Martin call it the Vanquish,
we call it the Vanish.
-Very good.
-Adaptive camoufIage.
Tiny cameras project
the image they see...
...onto a llght-emitting poIymer skin
on the opposite side.
To the casuaI eye, as good as invisibIe.
PIus, the usuaI refinements:
Ejector seat, torpedoes, target-seeking
shotguns to shoot down moblle objects.
The manuaI. ShouId be abIe to
shoot through that in a coupIe of hours.
Just took a few seconds, Q.
Wish I couId make you vanish.
Come in.
Before you Ieave on your mission
for IceIand...
...tell me what you know
of James Bond.
He's a doubIe-O.
A wlld one, as I discovered today.
He'll llght the fuse
on any expIosive situation...
...and be a danger to himseIf and others.
KllI first, ask questions Iater.
His method is to provoke and confront.
A man nobody can get cIose to.
A womanizer.
You're going to be seeing
a Iot more of him in IceIand.
With great respect,
a man llke him couId bIow my cover.
You voIunteered for this, but in three
months, you've found next to nothing.
Graves seems to be cIean.
Bond thinks differentIy, so I'm going to
Iet him do what you so abIy described:
Mix things up a llttIe with Mr. Graves.
With you there...
...things won't get out of hand.
In your three years in CryptoIogy, you've
kept business and pIeasure separate.
You haven't fraternized with any of your
fellow agents, despite severaI advances.
It wouId be foollsh to get invoIved
with someone within the community.
Especially James Bond.
