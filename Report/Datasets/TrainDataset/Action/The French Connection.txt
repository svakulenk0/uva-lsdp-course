Let's sing a little song-- Jingle Bells.

Come on.
Will you let me at him!
I want to bust him!
I want to bust him.
Let me talk to him!
You got a friend.
You gonna tell us who your man is?
- Who's your connection?
- What?
No! No, man, no!
Is it Joe the barber?
That's who it is, isn't it?
Don't give us any shit.
I don't know, man.
He lives on 125th Street above the barber shop.
What side of the street, north or south?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What side of the street does he live on?
Hey, shithead. When's the last time you picked
your feet?
A man in Poughkeepsie wants to talk to you.
Have you ever been in Poughkeepsie?
Come on, say it.
You've been in Poughkeepsie, haven't you?
I want to hear it!
Yes, I've been--
You've been there, right?
You sat on the bed, took off your shoes,
and picked your feet. Say it!
Yes!
You put a shiv in my partner.
All winter l got to listen to him
gripe about his bowling scores.
I'm busting your ass for those three bags
and nailing you for picking your feet in
Poughkeepsie.
Bonjour.
Yes, ma'am.
How many fell as?
Two?
You have a description?
Yes, ma'am.
Ah. You need a little help there, huh?
You dumb guinea.
How the hell did I know he had a knife?
- Never trust a nigger.
- He could have been white.
Never trust anyone. Going sick?
No.
Let's pop down the Chez and have a couple
drinks.
I’m beat. I’m going home.
- All right. One drink.
- Drink this.
Whip it out. Ha ha!
.How many times have l been downhearted.
.Looked up and saw him smiling.
.Like a shining dime?.
.Yeah.
.l hoped that he would stay and tell me why.
.He was so happy if he had the time.
.Oh, if there was a way to race him.
.Catch a flying horse and chase him.
.Everybody's going to the moon.
.Me and you.
.Everybody's going, It'll be quite soon.
.It's customary in songs like this.
.To use a word like spoon.
.By the light of the silvery.
.I take a flight to the silvery.
.You know, everybody's going to the moon.
.How many times while looking down.
.Has he heard us singing songs.
.And wondered who we were?.
.Hey.
.And envied us.
.Because the lady in the moon is gone.
.And now he misses her.
.And then he wondered to himself.
.Now, why is it no one ever pays a visit?.
.Everybody gets to go to the moon.
.Yeah, yeah, yeah.
.Everybody's got to go.
.It'll be quite soon.
.Now, it's customary in songs like this.
.To use a month like June.
.By the light of the silvery.
.We'll take a flight to the silvery.
.You know, everybody's going to the moon.
Now, isn't it a miracle
that we're the generation
that's gonna touch that shiny bubble with our
own two hands?
Right on, sugar!
.And it's got to make you glad.
.To be alive.
.Yes, it's got to make you glad to be alive.
.Ahh ahh.
.Ahh ahh.
Whoo!
.Ahh.
I make at least two junk connections
at that far table in the corner.
Right?
See that guy in the striped shirt and tie combo?
l thought we came here to buy me a drink.
Who is that clown?
That's a policy guy from Queens.
Right.
Dig the creep coming to the table now.
It's Jewish Lucky.
He don't look the same without numbers across
his chest.
That table is definitely wrong.
.It’s customary in songs like this.
.To use a word like spoon.
.By the light of the silvery.
.Fly to the silvery.
.Everybody's going to the moon..
More!
More!
What about the last of the big-time spenders?
No.You?
He's spreading it around like the Russians are
in Jersey.
Nice.
What do you say we stick around and give him a
tail?
Come on. Just for fun.
Give who a tail?
The greaser with the blonde.
What for? You want to play hide the salami
with his old lady?
Yeah.
Miss, uh... could l ask you about those boots
there?
Monica.
Who in the hell's that?
Who keeps score?
Hey.
Kissy devil, isn't he? Look at him.
They're all cousins, you know that. All right.
Yeah, say good-bye.
What's he got now?
Hudson Terraplane, that's what he got.
- No, no. Uh-uh. Easy.
- Okay.
Go to work.
Cloudy, lay odds he takes us to Dago Town.
I’ll take him, Popeye. He's nothing.
Relax. You're having fun, aingtya?
lf that's not a drop,
I’ll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
Make it Alexander's toy department.
He's coming back.
Pass him. Make a left.
Alain.
Our friend's name is Boca,
Salvatore Boca. B-O-C-A.
They call him Sal. He's a sweetheart.
He was picked up on suspicion of armed robbery.
Now, get this. Three years ago,
he tries to hold up Tiffany's in broad daylight.
Could have got 21/2 to 5, but Tiffany's wouldn't
prosecute.
Downtown they're pretty sure he pulled off a
contract
on a guy named DeMarco.
What about his old lady?
Her name's Angie. She's a fast filly.
She drew a suspended for shoplifting a year ago.
She's only 19 according to the marriage license.
What else?
He's had the store a year and a half.
Takes in a fast 7 grand a year.
What's he doing with two cars and $100 tabs?
The LTD's in his wife's name.
The Comet belongs to his brother-- Lou.
The Comet belongs to his brother-- Lou.
He's a trainee at the garbage man school on
Ward's Island.
He did time a couple of years ago.
Assault and robbery.
The black Cadillac.
Uh, New Jersey plates.
RWN 264. I know that one cat.
We saw him outside the Pike Slip Inn.
l want to get a blouse like that for my
girlfriend,
but I want you to model it.
Better not let my husband hear that.
I don't care if he hears it. Will you do it?
Okay. How much you going to pay?
- $50 an hour.
- 50 an hour?
- I’ll do it-- 200.
- Nah. Can't afford it.
I’ll call you later. Bye-bye.
It's 1:30. I didn't expect you till 2:00.
- You work around here?
- Yeah. Across the street.
- That's the third time he come here this week.
- Mm-hmm.
You got anything on this building?
The building's clean. l checked the tenant list.
Remember Don Ameche, the actor? He lives here.
Oh, yeah. And somebody else.
Does the name Joel Weinstock ring a bell?
- Oh, you're kidding.
- No, sir. He lives right here.
He was the bank on a shipment out of Mexico
three years ago.
Yeah, so I hear.
He's going to Ward's Island. We'll be spotted
there.
Maybe he's going to see his brother.
- Shit.
- Maybe it's another drop.
He gets a free ride.
Put your hands on your heads. Turn around.
All right, Popeye's here!
Get your hands on your heads,
get off the bar and on the wall.
Move! Come on, sweetheart, move.
Come on, move it!
Face the window!

Hands out of your pockets.

Turn around. Hey, you drop that? Pick it up.

Bring it here. Get your hands out of your
pockets.

Come here. You pick your feet?
Get over there. Hands on your head.
We told you people we were coming back.
We'll keep coming back until you clean this
bar up.
lf your neighbor drops something of yours--
What is this, a fucking hospital here?
Turn around there, fella.
What's this? This belong to you?
Huh?
Stand up there, Noddy.
Get your hands on your fucking head.
You want to take a ride, fat man?
Oh, bullshit.
Huh?

We're going to ask questions later.

Shut up!
Anybody want a milk shake?
All right, come over here.
You. And you.
Hey, whiskers! Come over.
Move ass when l call you!
Come on, you, baldy. Come on, move.
Put it on the bar. Get it on the bar!
Get the hell in there. Hands on your head.
All of it.
Smart-ass, you dropped something. Pick it up.
You want that hand broken? Get it up there.
What else you got in here, huh?
Turn around.
You're under arrest. You too.
Get in that phone booth.
Move. Move!
Get in there.
Put your hands against the wall and lock
yourself in.
Hey, you! Haircut!
Where are you going?
You talking to me, baby?
Yeah, I’m talking to you. Come here!
- What's happening, baby?
- Where you been, huh?
- I've been in there.
- You stand a toss?
- I’m clean.
- You use shit?
No, man. Who are you, Dick Tracy? l said l was
clean.
- Will l get stuck?
- No, I’m clean.
lf l do, you know what happens.
I’ll kick your motherfucking ass.
Hey, I’m clean. In where?
Gimme a nickel, man. Come on. Gimme a nickel.
Come on!
I’m clean. Why the fuck you want to come
down on me?
Oh, come on.
Goddamn cops aingt worth goddamn shit.
Everything's everything, baby.
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff's
all milk.
There aingt nothing around. Nobody's holding.
Got a name for you. Sal Boca. Brooklyn.
B-O-C-A.
Never heard of him.
What about his wife Angie?
Doesn't register. There's been some talk.
- About what?
- A shipment.
Coming in this week or the week after.
Everybody's going to get well.
- Who's bringing it?
- Who knows?
Oh, shit.
- Where do you want it?
- Huh?
Whew.
Where do you want it?
Oh, shit. This side.
Son of a bitch! Damn!
I’m going to check on this address in the Bronx.
lf they don't know you, it's your ass.
Get your hair done before Saturday.
We're going now. Good-bye.
Move ass.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
not out there in Ridgewood.
Detach us then, give us a shot.
At least till we learn if there's anything here.
This might be the lead we need to get Weinstock.
You couldn't burn a three-time loser with this
garbage.
The first thing you know,
you'll get an entrapment rap, both of you.
Brooklyn is loaded with guys
that own candy stores, two cars,
Put this candy store hustler together with
Weinstock,
maybe we got a big score.
Big score! At best he's selling nickel and dime
bags.
l wouldn't be infringing on your coffee-break
if I thought he was a nickel-and-dimer.
Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle. Or
have you forgotten?
Jesus Christ, Jimmy,
what's happened to you guys lately?
Every year you lead the narcotic bureau in
arrests.
Was it over a hundred again last year?
A high school kid in shorts with a twitch?
You grab a bellhop
because he's got three joints in his sock.
We got the information there's no shit on the
street, right?
It’s like a desert full of junkies out there,
This could be it! This candy store guy
puts on a big show in a fancy nightclub
with known narcotics connections. They were all
over him.
Then on our own, we tail him to Brooklyn
and sat on him practically a week.
Who do we come up with? Joel Weinstock.
Now, you got to let us have it.
Do you believe all this crap?
I go with my partner.
A wire. No, two wires.
One on the store, one on the house.
You know l have to get a court order
for a wiretap, don't you?
We know you can do it, Walt.
Popeye.
You still picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Mr. Devereaux, is this your first trip to
New York?
Uh, yes.
Why did you choose to come by ship?
The next several weeks will be very difficult
for me,
and the middle of the ocean is the only place
where the telephone isn't ringing all the time.
Do you agree with a recent survey finding
that shows Mayor Lindsay was the sexiest man in
the world?
Yeah!
The court orders are there for the wiretap.
Mulderig and Klein will sit in for the feds.
They'll make all the buys.
Keep them informed of everything that goes down.
You know Doyle, don't you, Bill?
Yeah, I know Popeye.
His brilliant hunches cost the life of a
good cop.
Look, if this is how you're coming in,
stay home and save us grief.
'Cause that's my opinion.
Shove it up your ass.
- Whatever.
- Bill, look. Do me a favor.
Give them a chance.
He came here with some basic information.
You worked with him before, you had some
trouble.
But don't get off on the wrong foot.
I aingt getting off on the wrong foot. Just keep
them off my back.
Any problems, come to me with it.
I’ll be happy to work with him.
He's basically a good cop.
He's got good hunches once in a while. Give him
a chance.

She locked me up with my own cuffs.

Oh!

Anybody hurt in this wreck?

this stuff.
Your scrapbook is like you-- a mess.
Get my pants, will you?
Come on.
Did you get the warrants?
Yeah. l also got two feds,
Mulderig and Klein.
Ohh! What do we need those pricks for?
'Cause our department's got about 908 bucks to

And they can get all they want from Uncle Sam.
Hello.

Every car sold here today--
Where are you?
Taking care of business.
What do you mean, taking care of business?
It’s after midnight.
You know, uh...
l had to meet some people tonight.
Finish all your meeting people and get back
here now.
Where am I going to get a pizza this time of
night?
Well, try, okay?
I don't know where to find a pizza joint open.
Sal? Don't forget. Anchovies.
Salvatori?
Hello, hello. This is Sal.
Who is he?
Sounds like a foreigner.
You meet me Wednesday at the hotel, okay?
- Sounds French.
- Great.
- Will I expect you?
- Uh, yeah. What time?
- 12:00, yes?
- Yes.
- Ohhh!
- Hot damn!
- Whoo!
Strictly small potatoes.
Sure can pick gem, Doyle.
Still wearing your gun on your ankle?
Someone told me the reason you do that is
when you meet a chick and rub up against her,
she can't tell you're a cop.
I said it's bullshit.
It’s got to be a fast-draw gimmick or something.
Bill, why don't you knock it off, huh?
He's getting too far ahead.
You're going to lose him.
For Christ sake, move the car, huh?
Move it!
Fuck!
Klein, this is Cloudy, do you read me?
Klein! This is Cloudy! Do you read me?
Bill, for-- Bill, come in for Christ sake!
This is Cloudy! Do you read me?
Listen, we lost him on the bridge!
All right. l got him.
He's heading north on East River Drive.
- Excuse me.
You take Sal.
I’ll take the beard.
There goes Sal.
You want the red or the white?
Pour it in your ear.
Yes, sir?
The guy that just walked in now--
What's his name?
Here.
Pretty sure that one's a Frog.
He made me too.
He lives on four, he went up to six. Cute. Real
cute.
The other guy's a Frog too.
He checked into the Edison, had
a hooker sent up.
Could've collared him right there.
- Who's on him?
- Klein.
- How about Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like
shit.
My partner and l made this case originally.
We don't want any feds screwing it up.
Case? You haven't shown me a damn thing.
Keep shooting your mouth off, I’ll knock you
through to next week!
- Knock it off.
- Don't tell me to knock it off!
- Come on!
- Cut it out, for Christ sakes!
There's nothing going down! Get some sleep.
Blast off.
One eight 0.
Good Housekeeping seal of approval.
Junk of the Month Club, sirloin steak.
Absolute dynamite.
If the rest is like this, you'll be dealing this
load for two years.
Is it worth a half million?
- How many kilos?
- 60.
This stuff takes a 7-to-1 hit on the street.
When it gets to nickel bags, it'll be 32
million.
Thank you, Howard. Take what's left there with
you and good night.
Uh-uh. Not that one. The little one.
We got a deal, huh?
What we got here, Sal, is a test.
A deal for half a million dollars-- maybe.
Maybe? Come on, Joe. The guy's in a hurry--
Wants the bread, wants to go back to France.
This guy's not going to hang around and play
games.
He's one of the shrewdest cats I ever come
across.
What am I, a schmuck?
What's the hurry? He could see some shows,
visit the top of the Empire State Building.
Don't jerk me, Weinstock.
l spent lots of time setting this up.
So, you want a badge? This is your first major
league game, Sal.
Move calmly, move cautiously. You'll never be
sorry.
Look. I’ve been damn careful up to now.
This is why your phone lines are tapped and feds
are crawling on you like fleas.
Look, I’m telling you, he'll take the deal
somewhere else.
Let him take his heroin someplace else
and find how easy it is to get a half million.
He wouldn't find there's any hurry to do this
kind of business.
The stuff's here! We could make the switch in an
hour!
He'll split if we don't move. This guy's got gem
like that.
He's everything they say he is.
What about you, Sal?
Are you everything they say you are?
I’ll be a son of a bitch.
Come on!
Thank you. Hello?
This is Doyle. I’m sitting on Frog one.
We got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Yeah, I know that.
The Westbury, my ass!
l got him on the shuttle at Grand Central.
What's going on up there?
I make him coming out of the hotel. He was free
as a bird.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, well, uh--
Listen, l don't care how many bartenders you got
that are sick.
Nah, I’m not working that joint.
That's right. Same to you, buddy.
Can l get a grape drink?
Watch the closing doors.
You son of a bitch!
Hi. Can I have a round-trip ticket to
Washington?
Washington? Cash or charge?
Cash.
Please print your name on both tickets
before you board the plane.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. Have a nice flight.
- Yes, sir?
- Round-trip to Washington, please.
So?
Everything's going great, terrific, and beautiful.
I’ll need a few more days, though.
The boys think we ought to cool it for a while,
just to make sure there's no heat.
You must take me for an imbecile.
Why do you think I asked you to meet me in
Washington?
l haven't spent five minutes in New York City
without the company of a policeman.
Look, I’m leveling with you.
l need a little more time.
It’s just that my people think
we ought to find a better time to make the
switch.
It has to be by the end of this week.
Look, Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It’s your problem.
Well, it's your problem too.
It’s so nice to have seen you again.
l got to have more time.
Just give me more fucking time, will ya?
You're not going to get it.
Found a set of works on the kid driving the
sports car.
His girlfriend's dead.
I say we keep sitting on Boca.
Give it up. It’s all over.
The deal's gone down by now.
We blew our warrants, we blew our cover.
Frank, listen, I know the deal hasn't gone down.
I - I know it. I’m dead certain.
Last time you were dead certain, we had
a dead cop.
Hey! Hold on!
Break it up, both of you!
Hold on to yourself! What's the matter with you?
Jimmy, you wasted two months on this.
No collars are coming in
while you two are running around jerking off.
Now, go back to work! You're off special
assignment!
Oh, my God!
Get down!
Get out of the area!
Leave her alone! Get away!
There's a sniper up there!
Aah!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop that man! He's wanted by the police!
- What's the next stop into the city?
- 25th Avenue.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Police emergency. I need your car.
-
- When am I going to get it back?
For Christ sake!
Hold it!
Stop! Halt!
- Aah!
Don't stop! Don't stop or I’ll kill you!
l got to stop in the next station.
Touch the brake, l blow you in half.
What's going on?
l don't know. Sit down, buddy. Relax.
Kouf? Kouf, you all right?
Hey, Kouf, you all right?
Don't answer.
Hey, Kouf, you all right?
Get back!
- Relax. Now, put your gun down.
- Keep going!
Oh, my God! Aah!
You're not going to get away with this.
- Get back!
- Come on now--
- l said get back!
- You can't get away.
Stop!
Hold it!
Let's get out of here!
Come on! Come on, shake your ass.
I’ll just get the door.
l can't seem to find the damn ticket. Where's
the guy?
He's getting my car from the back.
Thank you.
- Can l help you?
- Uh, yeah.
- Do you have the ticket?
-
What kind of ticket do you have?
Never mind.
He's in the brown Lincoln, foreign plates.
- All right, he's walking toward Front Street.
- Got him.
Angie's parked over there in the LTD.
Cute.
You stay with her. We're going to sit on the
Lincoln.
That car's dirty, Cloudy.
We're going to sit here all night if we have to.
What time is it?
- Huh?
- 10 after 4:00.
That's the third time those guys have been
around.
Let's hit gem! Hit gem!
Freeze!
Nobody move! Put your hands in the air!
- Get over there!
- Hey!
Get up there!
Now stay right there!
You move I’ll blow your fucking head off!
What the hell's that?
What are you doing? Turn around!
What do you mean?
Who's the boss here? Hey, who's running this
outfit?
- l am.
- You are?
What are you doing here? Who sent you down?
Don't talk back. What are you doing here?
- We saw the car.
- You heist this car?
Lock gem up.
Come on! Come on!
Keep your hands on your head.
Lock gem up and throw away the goddamn key!
Nothing but a bunch of lousy spic car thieves.
Nothing in there except a New York City map.
Are you bullshitting me?
That car's dirty.
Take it in and tear it apart.
Tear it right out. Tear it out!
Nothing here, Jimmy.
Look in here.
This is all solid.
There's nobody been under that car
since it came from the factory.
That thing is clean.
I don't buy that, IRC.
The stuff is in that car.
Well, you find it. l can't.
Look, the car was lost some time last night.
First, they send us to Pier One,
l don't understand why you parked down by the
waterfront.
You're staying in Midtown Manhattan,
and you lose the car by the Brooklyn Bridge?
Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations for a
French film.
He probably left the car to look at something.
The police commissioner said the car was brought
to this garage.
You'll have to be patient. We get 400, 500 cars
here a day.
Monsieur Devereaux is a very important guest of
this country.
He's working with the absolute cooperation and
participation of your government.
Here are his credentials from the French
consulate.
Unless you wish to see this episode portrayed in
his film,
I suggest you locate the car immediately.
You're in a no-smoking area, sir.
Will you please extinguish your cigarettes?
What was the weight of the car
when you got it, Irv?
You sure?
That's what it was-- 4,795 pounds
when it came into the shop.
The owner's manual says 4,675.
It’s 120 pounds overweight.
And when it was booked into Marseille,
it was 4-7-9-5.
That's still 120 pounds overweight. Jimmy's
gotta be right.
Listen, l ripped everything out of there, except
the rocker panels.
Come on, Irv, what the hell's that?
Shit!
Son of a bitch.
All right.
Got it for you, Randy.
It just came in from downtown. Who's Devereaux?
- l am. Why?
- I’m sorry, Mr. Devereaux.
But we get lots of cars here at night.
You mean the car is here now?
Yeah, it's right outside.
They stole it right off the street, huh?
Goddamn!
You're going to have to pay the towing charge.
l was told these things happen in New York, but
one never expects it.
Well, that's New York. Is this your first trip
here?
Yeah. Where's my car, please?
It’s right over here.
But you're lucky this time.
It’s in perfect shape, not a scratch.
You must lead a charming life.
Henri.
- Let's go!
- Bon voyage.
Merci.
l would give you a ride, but--
Yay!
- Listen, I’ll see you at Pop's tonight, huh?
- Okay, babe, take care, huh?
They got the bridge blocked off!
Let's get out of here!
Go! Go! Go!
Open this fucking door!
This is the police! You're surrounded!
Come out with your hands up!
This is the police! You're surrounded!
Bring up the gas!
Hold your fire!
Stop!
Stop!
All right, we're coming out! Hold your fire!
Drop the guns!
Over here! Let's go!
Popeye?
It’s me! It’s me!
Frog one is in that room.
Drop it!
Mulderig.
You shot Mulderig.
The son of a bitch is here. I saw him.
I’m going to get him.
