Stop!
Hey, y'all.
You bugger!
Not live rounds, Lara.
He's in real pain right now.
This is a major remodel.
This is a disaster.
Was it programmed to stop
before it took my head off?
Ah, well, that would be a no.
But you said make it
more challenging, so--
Hence, the live fire.
Hmm, live rounds again.
Poor Simon.
What has she done to you?
Very funny.
I'm only trying to
turn you into a lady.
And a lady should be modest.
Yes, a lady should be modest.
Brothers and sisters...
today is the 15th of May--
the first day
of the planetary alignment--
and we are still no nearer to
discovering the location of the key.
It seems...
we are running out of time.
This is not acceptable.
Mr. Powell,
your explanation for this, please?
I have no explanation.
Certainly no excuses.
Except to once again
respectfully remind the Council...
that we are working from clues based
on ancient cosmological models...
predating Aristotle.
But I'm happy to announce
that we're almost ready.
And I am supremely confident...
that we will have our answer in time
for the relevant planetary alignment.
So, we will have possession
of the key in...
one week.
Yes, indeed-- one week.
This is good news, Mr. Powell,
but remember...
we have only
a single opportunity...
to retrieve the two halves
of the triangle.
And if we fail...
we must wait another 5,000 years.
I don't know about you,
but that's more time...
than I am prepared to commit
to this enterprise.
We shall be ready.
Trust me.
We're not--
We're not ready, are we?
Good morning, Lara.
And what a beautiful morning it is.
Back to work, I'm afraid.
It's adventure time.
Egypt again.
It's nothing but pyramids and sand.
I know.
Gets everywhere-- in the cracks.
Spanish galleon?
Do you know what day
it is, Hillary?
Yes, of course.
The 15th.
And that is never a good day.
I miss you, Daddy.
I wish we could get back the time
that was stolen from us.
My father would love
to have seen this.
Tonight Pluto and Neptune
align with Uranus.
It's the first stage of
the alignment of all nine planets...
culminating
in a full solar eclipse.
It only happens
once every 5,000 years.
When is the eclipse?
One week from today.
But there is plenty
to look out for until then.
Incredible.
I wish you could remember her.
She loved you so much.
Mummy!
I wish I could remember her too.
I still have you, Daddy.
Yes, you do.
The exact alignment of the planets
necessary to activate the triangle...
only occurs once every 5,000 years.
But that will prove to be
just long enough...
for little Lara Croft to grow up...
and to find it.
Bryce!
Hello, fellas.
- How's business?
- Bryce!
Okay, okay.
I'm coming. I'm coming.
We have 83 rooms.
Why can't you live in the house?
Well, I'm a free spirit, me.
Right.
What's that smell?
This had better be good.
It's a clock.
I found it last night.
It was ticking.
Must be one of them
ticking clocks, eh?
It was hidden in a secret room.
Don't start.
Lara, it's a clock. It ticks.
It tells the time. It's wrong.
It started ticking...
last night during the first stage
of the alignment.
Well, gonna need some coffee.
Okay, in we go.
Looks pretty ordinary to me.
Well, keep looking.
Your coffee, sir.
Decaf latte with nonfat milk.
Oh, champion.
Steaming sump oil.
Wait. What did you do?
- I don't know. What did I do?
- Where is that?
I don't know. I just took
my hand off the fiber optics.
What is that?
- Oh, bugger!
- Bugger.
Screw 13 to quadrant four.
- Screw 14 to quadrant three.
- Oh, please.
It's my map,
so I know where they all came from.
It's camouflage.
Okay.
Hidden within.
What is that?
The All Seeing Eye.
Lot 121, a Louis XV Ormolu
mounted bracket clock.
Showing on my left,
One million eight. 1,900,000.
Two million pounds.
Two million pounds now.
Any advance on 2, 100,000 pounds?
Any more? Two million one.
At 2,200,000.
Two million three.
Lady's bid, 2,400,000 pounds.
Against you, sir.
Two million five? No.
at two million four. 2,500,000.
In a new place at 2,500,000 pounds.
Any more at 2,500,000 pounds?
Sold.
Lara, my dear.
- Mr. Wilson.
- Come to my study. I'll take that.
Lara Croft. I don't believe it.
- I'll just be a minute.
- Hi.
You still pretending
to be a photojournalist?
You know, I think it's really cool
that you still have a day job...
even though it's obviously
just for show.
So, Alex, are you still pretending
to be an archaeologist?
Do we always have to
fight like this?
I mean, maybe we don't.
- Maybe we do.
- Why?
- You stole my prayer wheels.
- Stole? Stole?
From you? You know, that's funny.
You know, it's--
It's not like you ever
really owned them or anything.
Hey, you're the tomb raider.
Mr. West, we are ready for you.
Oh, I think your clients need you.
Go ahead.
You're wanted on the floor.
After all, as you said so memorably,
''It's all just a business.''
Right?
So go do business.
Go.
Lara, this is a unique object.
Only one of the dials
is working.
It glows, like the eye, lesser.
But it seems
to be getting brighter.
And it's also
running backwards--
like it's not so much keeping time
but counting down to something.
- Yes.
- And look at the back.
It's as though it fits into
something, almost like a key.
Yes. Yes, fascinating.
- Incredibly beautiful.
- My father once told me...
of a magical triangle
stamped with the All Seeing Eye.
He said it gave its possessor
extraordinary power--
the power to control time.
He called it the Triangle of Light.
Have you heard of it?
No. No, I haven't.
He always steered his own course,
your father.
He was a great man.
Would you like some port?
- It's really very fine.
- No.
I can't help you, Lara.
This clock truly is a mystery.
- Hello.
- Lara?
Hello, it's Mr. Wilson.
Yes. Well, I--
You see, I had a second thought...
about that clock.
There is a man who
may be able to help you.
I gave him your number.
His name is Manfred Powell.
You should see him.
Thank you. I will.
- Good-bye, Lara.
- You take care.
Thank you.
Bugger.
Forgive me.
Lady Croft.
- Ah, Mr. Powell.
- Oh, no, no, no. Good heavens, no.
I'm actually
his associate, Mr. Pimms.
- Mr. Pimms?
- Yeah, like the beverage.
Yeah, she's here.
What does Mr. Powell do?
He's a lawyer.
I'm his law clerk...
and fairly recent appointment,
but enjoying it, all the varied work.
- A lawyer.
- Isn't it obvious?
Lady Croft, my pleasure.
- Manfred Powell, QC.
- Good morning.
I believe you are quite an authority
on things ancient and mythological.
Well, I travel.
No, no, Mr. Wilson said you were
quite the archaeologist.
Please.
Oh, he's very sweet.
He knew your father, I believe.
Yes, they were great friends.
I had the honor of meeting him
myself once, in Venice.
I was so sorry
to hear about his death.
This is the clock I spoke of.
Very interesting.
It's a shame you
only brought photographs.
Nevertheless, it is fascinating.
You said it started ticking
the night of the alignment.
Yes.
- You said you were a lawyer?
- Yes.
And the study of clocks is a hobby?
This is an obsession.
Really my speciality. My practice
centers around antiquities.
But the origin of this clock...
completely eludes me.
I think I've never seen
anything quite so beautiful...
that I know so little about.
This is a pleasurable torment.
My ignorance amuses me.
''My ignorance amuses me.''
Yes, well, I've always found
your ignorance quite amusing.
Powell, however, is not ignorant.
He's a liar.
- Anything you need?
- No. Thank you, Hillary.
- Don't you stay up too late.
- I won't.
Forward team, wait for my command.
In position awaiting your order.
Bastards!
Bloody hell!
On the left.
On the left.
Come on, Simon!
Bugger!
Lara, Lara, are you there?
Pick up!
Lara, can you hear me?
Are you okay?
I'm in the equipment room.
They're stealing my bloody clock.
I know. I saw them.
- You have to be my eyes.
- Are you armed?
After a fashion, yes.
All right.
Three bad guys.
Number one standing
by the Aston Martin.
Right.
Bingo!
- Next.
- Okay, number two...
crouched by the McLaren.
Oh, bugger!
-Are you okay?
- I just found my car keys.
You're done, mate.
Nice one.
I think they've all gone.
They got what they came for.
Sorry about that.
That's fine.
Hello?
What the hell happened here?
- Morning.
- Lady Lara Croft?
Yes. You have something for me?
I woke up this morning,
and I just hated everything.
Right. Thanks.
Who's Stribling, Clive
and Winterset then?
- Sounds like a bunch of lawyers.
- They are a bunch of lawyers.
- Well, I'll shut my face again.
- You are nosy.
I'm not nosy.
I just saw the name.
It was a funny name.
I just asked her what the name was.
It's from my father.
It was written before he died...
and delivered today
as per his instructions.
- Blimey!
- Holy sh--
''To see a world
in a grain of sand...
and a heaven in a wild flower...
hold infinity
in the palm of your hand...
and eternity in an hour.''
William Blake.
The All Seeing Eye.
My darling daughter...
I knew you'd figure this out.
If you are reading this letter,
I am no longer with you...
and I miss you...
and love you always and forever.
It also means I have failed...
and must place an awful burden
on your shoulders.
Lara, by now I am sure you will have
discovered the clock I concealed.
The clock is the key, Lara.
It will unlock the hiding place
of two pieces of a sacred icon.
This is the magical triangle I told
you about when you were little.
The Triangle of Light.
But it is no bedtime story.
The triangle was forged from metal
found in the crater of a meteor...
that had fallen to Earth
at the exact moment...
of the previous alignment
of the nine planets.
The people of the light built
a great city in this crater...
where they worshipped the triangle
for its ability to control time.
It gave its possessor a power that
could be used for good or great evil.
An abuse of this power led
to the destruction of the city.
To be sure no man would
ever again wield this power...
they split the triangle
into two pieces...
and hid them at opposite ends
of the Earth.
Lara, do you remember the jasmine
that only grows in one temple...
along the ancient Khmer trail
in Cambodia?
Find that and you will
have found the entrance...
to the Tomb of the Dancing Light...
where the first half
of the triangle is hidden.
You must be there
at the exact moment...
of the second phase
of the planetary alignment.
You must hurry.
You have very little time.
And as the planets
move into alignment...
the world will be
in great danger...
for the secret society
known as the Illuminati--
devious, dangerous men...
who seek to fulfill
an ancient prophecy...
by reuniting the two halves...
and attaining the triangle's
awesome and terrible powers.
This you must prevent
at all costs.
So, Lara, I am asking you
to complete my work--
to find and destroy
both halves of the triangle.
How are you going to get to Cambodia
and get the clock back in 15 hours?
I'll be calling in a favor.
- What kind of favor?
- Well, that is a secret.
If I told you,
I'd have to kill you.
Lady Croft, are you on target? Over.
Right on target.
Thank you, boys. Over and out.
How predictable.
Alex West.
What are you doing here?
We have 72 minutes
to the next alignment.
We have to work faster.
Come on, guys!
Come on, guys! Come on. Pull!
Pull! It's coming!
Good.
So, any sign of Lady Croft?
Not yet.
Lara's overrated.
She's good, don't get me wrong...
but she's in it for the glory...
whereas I'm in it for the money.
Fortunately.
- Into the belly of the beast.
- And out of the demon's ass.
Jasmine.
Remember, what we are looking for
is hidden not only in space...
but also in time.
The clock is the key.
My God.
''Return the iron to
the stone's embrace...
the wheel of heaven will turn.
Exhume the light
from its watery grave...
to receive the gift of heaven...
as you are condemned
to the depths of hell.''
Right. Pretty much touch anything
and you get your head chopped off.
We have two minutes, Mr. West.
You're the tomb raider.
Figure it out.
Tempus fugit.
Yes, ''time flies.''
It's the swords!
Come on, guys. Get up here.
Give me a hand here.
That's it. Come on.
Coming down.
I want them all down.
Take them, carry them
across the ladders.
Let's hustle.
All right. Now slide them
into the slots over there.
We place the clock here
at the exact moment of alignment.
Come on. Let's go! Move it!
Too slow, ladies, too slow.
Come on.
- That's it.
- Count it down.
- The timing needs to be exact.
- No shit.
Sixty seconds to go.
fifty seconds.
Cease fire!
Hold your fire!
- Keep counting.
- You're making a big mistake!
- 37--
- Tourist visa?
- No, I'm working.
- Lady Croft, tell me...
is there a good reason
why I kept you alive?
Yes. That is not the true eye.
- This is the true eye.
- It's not, actually.
It's a mirror image.
I think you're trying to cheat me
out of my little ray of sunshine.
Why would I try and cheat you
out of anything now?
I need you to get the piece
so I can steal it from you later.
You're bluffing.
Julius, make a mental note--
Kill Miss Croft
if she attempts any such thing.
Yes, sir, Mr. Powell.
We can do it my way, or we can come
back in time for the next alignment...
and you are welcome
to try and kill me then.
In, oh, say
another 5,000 years.
ten...
nine, eight...
seven, six, five...
four, three...
two, one...
zero.
I guess she was right.
The log must pierce the urn.
Come on!
It's slowing down.
It's never gonna make it.
Pure light, fire and water.
Get the clock.
Got it.
Hold it right there!
Give it up.
Are you going to shoot me, Alex?
My phone is wet.
Yes?
Lady Croft, how are you?
Alive.
And kicking, I hope.
- And you?
- Superlative.
Of course, I digress.
You have my half of the triangle.
And you have
my father's clock.
Listen, my dear. Without each other
we are quite useless at this point.
We should reevaluate
our positions.
Like it or not,
you and I are in business together.
We should have
a business meeting.
You mean you'd love to have another
opportunity to try and kill me.
Oh, that's harsh.
But perhaps.
Wait and see.
Come to Venice,
Via Dolorosa.
Wonderful. Bye then.
Harder.
Here it comes. Hide, everybody.
Look out.
It's some sort of machine.
Bryce, it's me.
- Hello?
- It's Lara. I found the temple.
- Ran into Mr. Powell.
- Did you get the clock?
No, but I got the first piece.
Oh, beautiful, smashing.
Seems I'm level pegging
with Mr. Powell.
-Won't he just want to kill you now?
-No, silly.
His problem is that he needs
the piece that I have.
Until then,
I'm his new best friend.
What about the other half?
The final alignment...
is in 66 hours and 53 minutes,
and we've still got no idea...
where the second piece is hidden.
He's going to tell me
where the second piece is.
- He will?
- Bryce, trust me. Pack for Venice.
Pack for where?Hello?Lara?
Bye then.
Drink.
Rest.
There's no rest
for the wicked.
You got what you came for?
- I did, yes.
- Too bad.
Bad for the world.
The world is safe now.
Little bit safer,
perhaps...
because you will go on.
Your father said
you will never give up.
My father?
You knew my father?
Now, drink.
Finish your tea.
It tastes quite bad,
but it is good for you.
See?
Good evening.
You're with the Illuminati.
Beg your pardon?
There's no such thing.
It's just a bedtime story.
Illuminati--
The people of the light.
Have you brought my triangle?
No, of course you haven't.
You've hidden it somewhere.
You can keep
the triangle you have...
and I will keep your father's clock,
and we can be partners.
Who sits here?
We can be partners
and go for the big prize--
the Triangle of Light.
Yes, but who sits here?
It's an incredible dream,
an awesome power.
It could set right
so many wrongs.
I don't think you sit here,
do you?
I sit here...
on God's right hand,
as it were.
In fact...
I now sit exactly
where your father sat.
You're lying.
No, he mentored me
in the order.
It was truly an honor.
I don't believe you.
My father was not
with the Illuminati.
- He would have told me.
- He had a great many secrets.
Not from me.
Especially from you.
I know what you want, Lara.
Oh, I doubt it.
Another life with your father--
a second chance.
It'll be within my power
to give.
The triangle gives
its possessor...
the power of God--
to move back and forth
through time, undo the past.
Help me, and you will get
what I know you want--
to have your father
returned to you.
And how do I know
once I gave you that piece...
that you wouldn't then
just try to kill me?
Would it make it easier
for you--
on more familiar ground--
if I killed you now?
Will you reconsider?
- Hello, Alex.
- I suppose you think...
I'm a greedy,
unscrupulous sellout...
- and do about anything for money.
- Yes, that's right.
Well, the money bit's true,
I guess.
Is it, Alex?
If you cross me, we may not
be able to remain friends.
Always a pleasure.
Now for a cold shower.
I think we're in big trouble.
- Hold this, will you?
- Thank you.
They already think we have
Lady Croft's piece of the triangle.
Yes. They think it's in that box
you're carrying right now.
Is it?
Why don't you
worry about something else?
Of course it's not.
I don't understand. What chance
of success do we have without it?
Zero. Don't dwell on it.
But--
What a nice surprise.
Thank you.
Now, time to save the universe
again then, is it?
Absolutely.
Are we sure
she's really necessary?
Well, one tomb raider
is good. Two, better.
Me bum's gone to sleep again,
all down the left cheek.
Really?
That's fascinating.
- How much longer?
- A few hours.
We have to take
the last hour over land.
Helicopters won't
fly near the ruined city.
It's a dead zone.
We take all doggies.
Much-o U.S. greenback.
All doggies.
Welcome to the dead zone.
It's not a country.
It's an ice cube!
Come on!
All right. Let's go.
Go on, get it!
Holy shit.
It's a time storm.
Time is broken here.
We must find the eye!
All of you! Hurry!
We're running out of time!
Hurry! Hurry!
It's begun.
Fifty bucks says
the piece is inside the sun.
For God's sake, hurry! The eclipse
will be over in a few minutes!
Give me the clock.
I know what to do.
Has she got the piece?
We will now...
unite these two parts--
the past and the present.
At last,
we of the Illuminati...
will control time and fulfill
the sacred promise...
to our ancestors.
- Soon, the entire world will bow--
- Enough of this twaddle.
Come on! Come on!
Not quite what you hoped for,
Mr. Powell?
I have a gut instinct
about this.
After all, you are
the daughter of a genius.
Let me test my theory.
You had to let him go.
No more bubbles.
You show me
how to complete the triangle...
we can change his fate.
If you deliver me the power of God,
I will spare him.
It's only a little trip
back in time.
But I'm pretty sure you've figured
out the answer to the problem.
And then, of course,
there's the loss of your father.
I can change that.
You'd better be ready
for this.
- Unhook your laser sight.
- Do it.
''To see a world
in a grain of sand.''
Daddy?
Is this real?
It is a crossing...
of my past and your present.
Why did you not tell me
about the Illuminati?
You were only a child.
You could have written
in your journals.
- You never mentioned it-- not once.
- I burst to tell you everything.
But in the fierceness
of my own battles...
I strove to tell you
only that which would inspire you...
and keep you safe.
I love you so much.
But I've missed you.
And I have missed you.
I know why you came here--
why you took the power of the
light-- but this must not happen.
Why? Why can't we use
the power just this once?
Why can't you stay?
We can't change time.
But time was stolen from us...
and it's not fair.
No, it's not fair.
But you have stolen
time itself...
and you must give it back.
You must destroy the triangle.
Suddenly I feel so alone.
You're never alone. I am with you
always, just as I've always been.
Move out!
Wait!
Your father begged for his life...
when we caught him betraying us.
He pleaded like a baby.
Surrender.
Never.
He seemed particularly concerned
that I shouldn't take this.
Lara, no!
The place is coming down!
- This is insane!
- Get them out of here.
You just hurry.
There you go--
safe and sound.
No guns.
Oh, my God!
Quiet.
What?
