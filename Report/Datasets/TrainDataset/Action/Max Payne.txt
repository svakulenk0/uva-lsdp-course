and delivered over here to us.
We call each of the witnesses to see if they
have anything to add to their original statements.
And if they can?
We send the file to the original
precinct for follow-up.
Don't get your hopes up though.
This is the Cold Case office.
Once you've been through the file
and come up empty, you bring it here.
It hits his desk,
the case is officially dead.
So what if there's no phone number
for a witness?
- Should I follow-up in person?
- No, no. We don't do that kind of stuff down here.
I don't understand.
Then how-
How am I supposed to solve the unsolvable
murder mystery and redeem yourself?
There's a tragic story behind why
I'm standin' here givin' you this tour.
We all did something,
so just save it.
What do you say we grab a beer
after work or something?
- So what's his story?
- There is none.
- But back there you said-
- Listen.
His wife and kid were murdered.
They never found the guy.
That's his story.
Remember when you were a kid and you'd hold
your breath when you went past a graveyard?
Just, uh, leave that man alone.
Yo, homey,
that's a really nice watch.
Kinda reminds me of one I lost.
Oh, you didn't lose it. You pawned it
up on 128th a few hours ago.
Ask Doug. He was there with you.
Are you followin' us, asshole?
No.
I'm only following you.
Aw, hell, no.
What, you a cop or somethin'?
Not tonight.
That's too bad.
Now go get my watch.
Come on, Dougie.
Come get his watch.
I guess this ain't
your lucky day, now, is it?
Whoa!
No! No! No!
Watch over me. Watch over me.
- Watch over me. Watch over me.
- Open your eyes. Now!
- Oh, Jesus.
- Have you ever seen this woman?
- No.
- You got busted robbing a house in New Jersey...
with William Preston
six months ago.
- Bill's dead.
- Why the hell do you think I'm talkin' to you?
Did you ever hear anyone say
anything about this woman?
Bill died-
Bill died 'cause their wings
couldn't lift him up.
No, he got shot robbing a liquor store.
What are you talking about?
Their wings are gold, Max.
They just look black. Feathers-
Get up!
- All right. All right.
- Hey, buddy.
Man, I told you not to come here.
William Preston was a dead end.
I am done helping you, Max.
I paid my debt to society,
you know?
l- I've cooperated enough, man.
-
- Okay?
What's goin' on in there?
What? It's a dinner party.
Okay?
I'm a little offended
I didn't get my invitation.
I didn't send out invita-
Look, I told you. Go find Bill's partner.
I did. Dougie only wanted to talk
about birds or something.
He was a whack job.
Now I need a new name.
- Well, I'm outta ideas then!
- Hey, baby.
- Okay. What- Not now, bitch!
- Asshole!
Look, okay? I told you.
I don't know those kinds of people now.
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Yeah. Th-Th-This is a dinner party.
- Listen. If you don't give me a new name...
-
I'm gonna start frisking
every one of your friends.
You're chasing ghosts, Max. God!
You try sleeping once in a while,
you could see that for yourself.
I thought I knew
all of Trevor's friends.
Max, Natasha.
Natasha, Max.
Jesus Christ!
- Got a light?
- I don't smoke.
- That's interesting.
- What?
Your tattoo.
That's interesting.
Oh, thank you.
-
-
I don't know him. Okay?
- Shit.
- What?
- You can't keep following me around.
- Hey!
- Mind your own business.
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.
- Da?
- Da.
Hey!
Why don't you relax?
It's a party.
Have a drink.
My sister.
Sort of a bitch.
- Hey, Max! Max.
- What are you doing?
You have to go.
Okay? Now.
I need to
ask her something first.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
There you are.
Where'd you go?
Take me somewhere. I'll tell you.
See you around, Lupino.
Hey.
- Easy.
-
You just move in?
So we're somewhere.
What was goin' on
in that room back there?
Hey!
Who was the guy
with the tattoos on his face?
Mmm.
Fine.
What was her name?
What are you talkin' about?
Who?
The girl from the boring story
you want to tell me-
the one that ends
with you living here.
Very sad.
Like this you can make love to her
just like she never left you.
Oh, Max. I miss you.
Get out.
- Excuse me?
- I said, get out now.
You're kicking
out of your bed?
Yeah.
Get your shit and get out.
This is Owen. Leave a message.
Owen, it's Natasha.
Where's Lupino?
I need some more stuff.
Yeah. Call me. Okay?
No!
No, not yet!
Not yet! Not yet!
- What?
- Look. Jump in, will you?
- Where are we going?
- I need you to look at something.
-
-
-  What about cameras?
Security cameras anywhere?
There's got to be somebody
who saw something.
Time of death is?
We got body parts.
- What happened to them?
Her. Just one.
I don't believe it.
What, are you two back together?
Did you kiss and make up?
Where are we on the weapon?
We're nowhere yet.
I mean, looks like a blade...
but, uh, too much blood
for that to be right.
Hey, O'Brien! Just a sec. Hey, listen.
- Why are you showing me this?
- We found this here.
Did you know her, Max?
It's Natasha.
Let's take a ride.
- What are we doing here?
- We're getting a beer, right?
You'd rather do this
in the street?
Fine. You were with the victim last night.
Your wallet was found in the alley.
If you don't wanna talk to me, they're gonna
send somebody who doesn't know you...
and won't care about
your side of the story.
- I didn't kill her. I don't need a side.
- What's goin' on, Max?
What are you mixed up in, man?
You can talk to me.
You know what they think about you
at the force already, right?
You should hear all the questions
I get about my old partner.
- Well, good thing you got my back then, huh?
- What's that supposed to mean?
It means that with your follow-through
on unsolved murders...
I don't have much hope
for that girl in the alley.
Is that what you think?
That I didn't
work Michelle's case?
I did everything.
- He's still out there somewhere.
One of them is still out there.
That's everything.
We're done here.
Very good.
- Detective Max Payne-
-  Is not available.
- Shit!
- Please leave a message.
-
- Max, it's me, Alex.
Ms. Sax?
I'm sorry for your loss.
And we pulled
her cell phone log.
Uh, last call was to an...
Owen Green.
Called him twice.
-
-  Max, it's me, Alex.
Alex, are you in here?
Alex?
Alex?
Alex?
BB? Where am I?
Saint Mary's.
Came in lookin' pretty bad, Max.
What happened?
I don't-
Alex.
When dispatch
couldn't raise him...
they found out from Christa
where he'd gone.
First unit got to you in time.
But Alex was-
Alex was dead.
I got six shots off.
I hit something- someone-
- You gotta check the hospitals. You gotta check for-
-
I'm not a cop anymore, Max.
I came to see about you.
He wanted to
tell me something.
Listen. Anything
you can remember will help.
They got nothing for leads.
The whole force has  pegged
as the prime suspect.
Yeah, you tell them
where to find me.
Wake starts in an hour.
I'll pass that along.
- Paying my respects.
Not like that, you aren't.
I should have a clean shirt
for you at the office. It's on the way.
- When did they move in here?
- I guess we got the building last year.
- "We"?
- Sorry.
Gets to be a habit.
- Mornin', Spike.
- Good morning, Mr. Hensley.
You know the drill, sir.
Sign in your guest, please.
Oh, my God.
Max.
Ms. Horne.
How have you been?
Fine, thanks.
I hope you know
you can always call me.
I know. I've been meaning to.
I got the cards. Thank you.
She was such a bright light
in this company.
I'm not makin' any guarantees
that any of this'll fit.
I saved one of those for you.
Third page from the back.
She liked art, right?
It's a nice thing,
a scholarship.
-
- Hey, Joe.
Max, you remember Joe,
right?
Hey. You here pickin' up
some overtime?
I'd think twice about that.
Hear the boss is a real asshole.
Now that he's head of security,
we're supposed to laugh at his jokes.
They still pay me like the janitor.
- She's lookin' for you.
Just tried me
in my office too.
-
- Give me a second.
Yeah?
Christa.
All it would have taken
is one word from you...
to give Alex some peace.
Are you happy now, Max?
You made him think
he hadn't done enough.
What have you done, Max?
What has Max Payne done?
Except for bring misery...
to everyone
who ever cared for him.
Now please get out of my house.
Please, just go.
Ah, geez.
Watch out for this prick.
Detective Max Payne?
Jim Bravura, Internal Affairs.
I need you to come with me.
- Now?
- Yeah, now.
How'd the girl
have your wallet?
She stole it.
What do you mean, "stole"?
Like, picked your pocket?
How was it
you knew each other?
We met through a friend.
Trevor Duncan.
- He's your friend?
- I guess.
That's classy.
You know what Trevor does
for a livin', I assume.
He used to snitch for me.
Oh, used to.
Tell me somethin', Max.
What's a glorified file clerk
still need a snitch for, huh?
So you'd piss
in a cup for us, right?
You just said the magic words. Why don't
you call when you hear from a union lawyer?
You and Detective Balder haven't
worked together since your reassignment.
- He wanted to talk.
Hey, asshole!
I got two bodies in 10 body bags.
-
- Nice work, Detective.
Look, if you're really his friend,
then talk to him.
Well, let's hope that felt good.
Makes you look guilty.
You understand that, right?
It's not just Alex's unit
that thinks you're the guy.
You need friends
on the force right now.
There's only so much I can do
from the outside.
Where you goin'?
Stupid son of a bitch.
- Just the guy.
- Where you think you're goin'?
Back up. Back up.
Make a hole!
Back up, goddamn it!
Make a hole!
- Open up, Max!
Open up! Don't make it hard!
Open up!
Goddamn it! Open up this fuckin' door!
- Open up!
Get ya, Max!
Son of a bitch!
Hey, Mike.
Where is he?
Oh, for God's sake, Max. You're gonna freeze
to death. Why don't you come inside?
Alex knew something about Michelle.
Something new.
Don't you think he would've
told you if he had something?
He was trying to
the night he was killed.
- Whatever was in the room-
- What do you think you're looking for?
- Forget it. All right?
- Max, talk to me!
Max?
Now where you goin'?
Drop your weapon.
Just take it easy.
- Remove your backup piece with your left hand.
- That's it.
- Kneel down.
- What?
- Kneel the fuck down!
Shit.
We need to talk about my sister.
Look, my partner was killed too.
We're both looking for the same person.
Yeah, you.
Who's Owen Green?
- How did you get that name?
- Look, Natasha called-
- Don't say her name!
- I heard her call him. Okay?
Owen's probably the last person
who saw her alive.
Yeah? Except for the guy that
left his wallet laying by her body.
Does that sound like something
a homicide cop gets wrong?
Whoever killed your sister probably did
the same thing to my partner and maybe my-
Look, you wanna help?
Help me find Owen Green.
Green is on the top floor.
You know what I do for a living.
You try anything, and I'll kill you.
Who is this guy?
Some junkie
my sister used to know.
- Owen! Owen, open up!
- Owen?
- Owen?
-
Hey!
They're comin'.
They're coming.
Owen, look at me.
I know Natasha called you.
Do you know what happened to her?
She's gone.
They took her.
Owen, just relax.
They took her up in their wings.
They took her.
-
Jesus.
It just happens.
My Natasha
got all her work done here.
I have to
call you back, okay?
Can I help you
with somethin'?
Yeah.
If I wanted to
get this tattoo-
- You in the marine corps?
- This one.
That's a Norse Valkyrie.
Vikings used to wear them
for protection.
Valkyries fly over the battlefield
picking out the righteous dead.
They reward the people
who draw first blood.
A soldier's angel.
In Norse mythology...
the only way
you get to go to heaven...
is to die in violence.
You die in your sleep,
you go to hell.
- Protection from what?
- Huh?
What do you mean, "huh"?
You said people get the tattoo as protection.
What are they afraid of?
Please-
- Come on!
- ¡Callate!
Oh, God!
This is far enough.
I need to speak with Lincoln.
- You expecting company there, Lincoln?
- It's very dangerous right now.
I hear about your sister.
Yeah?
You know anything about it?
She will not be the last.
What about the tattoos?
Huh? What do they mean?
The wings.
He marks them.
Yeah? What does that mean?
The devil
is building his army.
Yeah.
Does this devil have a name?
Many.
The one you are looking for
is Lupino.
A place called Rag Na Rock.
Listen. Um, you still got
an in with the cops, right?
See if they know anything
about a Detective Max Payne.
Max Payne?
What?
Three years
of kicking down doors.
He is looking
for something...
that God wants
to stay hidden.
And that's what makes him
even more dangerous.
Mona,
stay away from Max Payne.
You don't want to be near him
when Judgment Day comes.
- What is it? What's going on?
- Coffee?
It isn't that
I've been missing something.
It's that something  missing.
- So?
What would somebody want
with her work papers?
I don't know.
Who would then? Her old supervisor-
What is his name?
Max, this has gone far enough!
- That snotty-nosed, little preppy prick-
What is his name?
Colvin. John Colvin.
Is he still around?
Hold on, Max.
BB, is he still working
for the company?
Jason Colvin.
Guy's name is Jason.
Thank you.
A file
can't tell you everything.
Maybe you think that's all
you need to know about Max.
how happy they were together-
Michelle!
Michelle! Michelle!
-
- Michelle!
It's okay. The angels burn
within them now.
-
-
We looked everywhere for the third guy.
But there was nothin' to go on.
Of course not.
Understand.
This is my old partner's kid.
He's family.
You gotta help him here.
You should hear the kind of things
Max is saying.
He's gotten in his head that someone here
at the company is responsible.
I'm worried he's gonna... get into another
situation before I can convince him to come in.
- So you really think he's-
- I think you need to find him.
What is it, Jason?
I, uh-
Is this a threat?
No! No, l-
I just thought
you should be aware.
Just take care of it, Jason.
You'll have the opportunity
to come in and talk to-
There's someone in your office.
It's a detective.
This your daughter?
Yes, it is.
Three years old.
She's beautiful.
Is there something I can
help you with, Detective?
I don't know yet.
Maybe if you told me
what this was about.
It's a homicide-
multiple homicides.
I didn't get your name.
Max Payne.
Sorry.
I didn't recognize you.
That's okay.
What can you tell me about
what Michelle was working on...
right before she died?
I don't know, routine projects.
Um-
Nothin' really
out of the ordinary.
Look, it's really hard
to be specific that... long ago.
- Um-
- Well, can't you look it up?
I don't know how I would,
really.
You know th-that far back,
uh, any documents we had-
would be gone, and-
I'm not-
I'm not sure of any other way.
So there's just no trace of her?
Well, it's nothing personal.
We just, uh-
Can't keep-
Save everything and, uh-
- You need to make a call?
- Maybe I should.
Yeah. Beautiful office
you have here.
-
- Jackie, hi. Uh, Detective-
- What do you know?
- Wait.
I need to talk to somebody about
a woman that used to work here.
You can have a seat over there.
-
- Uh, Mr. Colvin?
- You're lying to me! Why?
- I'm not!
-
- Tell me what happened to Michelle.
- I don't know.
Mr. Colvin, are you okay?
- Jackie!
- What was she working on?
- I don't know!
I was in charge of a different project.
It was a government contract.
What did it have to do
with Michelle?
Nothing! She was just-
-
-  Security.
Can I speak to BB, please?
- Yeah?
- BB, help! It's Jackie. Jason's in trouble.
- What?
- Should I call your guys?
- No, no, no. I'll call.
- Hurry, please.
-
- Oh, shit. Okay.
It was a military operation.
It was a disaster. It only worked
on one percent. Made them invincible.
All right? The rest suffered horrible
hallucinations- devils, demons.
I mean,
the effects were uncontrollable.
And the stuff was so addictive, we couldn't
even guarantee the safety of our own scientists.
They'd kill 'em,
just for an extra dose.
- Is that what happened to Michelle?
- No.
- What do you mean, no? What happened to her then?
- Please! Jesus!
Please! Look. She didn't even know
what was coming for her.
I will tell you what happened. You gotta
get me outta here though. Right now.
What are you talking about?
I will confess to everything,
but you gotta get me outta here!
That's not good enough! You tell me
what happened to her right now!
She was killed because of the drugs!
The envelope.
Please. You've gotta
protect me from them.
Who are you talking about?
The man who killed your wife!
Get the envelope.
Get it!
Let's go.
-
- Calm down!
- Relax! N.Y.P. D!
-
-
-  Central Dispatch.
- This is Jim Bravura. I.A.
What unit is responding
to the Aesir call?
The Aesir building! You mean
nobody's called anything in yet?
- Would you like to report an incident?
- Hell, yes, I'd like to report somethin'!
We have machine gun fire
in Midtown!
Fire!
-
Move! Move! Move! Move!
-
-
-
- Knock down that door!
- Put your hands up!
- You need to come in now!
- Not a chance!
- Come on!
- Is this about your wife?
- Colvin knew.
- Take it easy, Max.
Just come in and we'll talk about this
right now. All right?
Clear!
Move!
- Where is he?
- I can't see!
Got anything?
-
- No, he's gone!
Great job, boys! See what you did?
You let 'im get away.
- Relax, motherfucker! N.Y.P.D.
- Yeah. Good job!
Everybody gonna get a medal for this.
Great! Damn!
I'm at the office.
I'll call you back.
- You need to see this.
great generals have always known
the one fundamental truth of warfare.
Thanks to the breakthroughs made
by Aesir Pharmaceuticals...
the military of tomorrow will be able to
unlock the limitless potential inside every soldier.
How has your experience of combat
improved since taking the drug Valkyr?
Well, I'm never scared, for starters.
You face down
a group of insurgents...
and instead of fear,
you're filled with, um, peace, I guess.
You feel like you have wings.
Oh, definitely. It's just whatever it takes
to win the war out there.
I feel indestructible.
Nothing can stop me.
I can face anything.
I can only speak for myself,
and, um, no.
- I apologize. You wanna do it again?
- No, we're good.
-
Killed my wife.
He's in an old club
called Rag Na Rock.
- You know where it is?
- Yeah.
You have my help with anything else,
but not to go in there.
Yeah, you keep it then.
You don't wanna
make it out alive.
You think that if he puts you out
of your misery, you'll be with them again.
Yeah, I hope
that's how it works.
-
-
-
- Ow!
-
You hear them coming.
We'll see which one of us
they're flying for.
We'll see which one of us
they love best.
-
God, you're so blessed.
The angels-The angels are not
done with you yet!
BB?
What's goin' on here, BB?
- Let's go.
-
Let's get outta here.
BB- BB, what's goin' on here?
BB, I looked at Lupino, he didn't know
who I was. What are you doin' here?
- Now?
- No, not yet!
Cuff him.
She mentioned it to me without knowing
what it really meant.
I had to-
I had to talk to her.
Show her my side
before she took it to someone else.
Michelle was the first problem in my life
small enough to reach out and stop.
Once that happened, though, once I realized
I could use the strength of my hands...
to keep one thing
from being taken away from me-
Well, by the time Michelle
stopped screaming that night...
I'd learned
the most amazing lesson.
I could've been doing this
my entire life.
I was a new person
that night.
All the other things
that I'd ever let go.
The-The times I'd accepted
my own... weakness...
I could've just reached out
my hands and stopped it.
how to make use of Lupino and
the rest of them, well, that was easy.
But only because of Michelle-
the first problem
I really solved for myself.
The second... was the baby.
Okay, enough.
Enough of this shit.
BB!
Joe, why don't you
calm the fuck down?
-
- It's not like we didn't see it comin'.
Sullen, withdrawn.
Grab me some of that rope.
It's a good thing his father
didn't live to see it though.
- The great Bill Payne's only son.
A strung-out
junkie suicide.
- It would have eaten him alive-
-
Screw him.
He'll freeze to death.
Come on.
Not yet, Max.
Why is half my force here instead of out
on the street? Under what authority do you-
I am investigating the shooting
of an unarmed civilian, Jason Colvin.
And the attempted murder
of Detective Max Payne.
Really? Well, I heard
he took the first shot.
If I know the men I serve with, I don't think
that they're gonna contradict that.
- Yeah, and what kinda men would that be?
- These are real cops.
- Oh.
- No offense.
None taken. Agent Taliente,
I'd like you to meet a real cop.
Detective. Jack Taliente,
Special Agent, F.B.I. Who are you?
Bravura called in the F.B.I.
They're on their way.
For God sakes, come on!
Max is dead! They got nothin' else!
- Get 'em in! Get 'em in!
-  Car's waiting! Let's go!
-
- Calm down, Joe.
This is Air One
proceeding northbound 3-5-0-500.
E.T.A. three mikes.
Give me a frequency to push to.
Copy that, Dispatch.
We're inbound.
Your car's waiting, sir.
Oh, shit.
- He's not dead. He's here.
- Bullshit.
- Let's move it! Move! Move!
- Go!
Get him, Joe!
Where the hell is he?
Where the hell you going, Joe?
- We need more information.
Do you got Bravura on the line for us? We need-
We need more information on this situation.
-
- Who you callin'?
-
- It's late.
- I need you to send a helicopter to the roof.
- What are you talking about, BB?
The Michelle Payne thing's
coming back on us!
Take some C-4.
- Wire it so he can't make it to the roof.
- Are you nuts?
- You saw him.
- No!
-
-
-
Okay, we got multiple shots
fired. We need back-up ASAP.
- Max.
Max?
-
-
-
-
-
Max! Max, come on.
Listen, I will hold them off for as long
as I can, but you have to finish this.
-
- Max, come on.
Come on.
Come on. Take it.
Take it!
Max, come on.
Look at me.
You're not done yet.
Come on. Come on, pick up!
Where are you? Come on!
-
-
Come on now, Mona.
I'm sure we can
work something out.
BB!
- Bravura!
- You take Payne alive if there's anything left.
-
-
Calm down, BB.
Holy shit!
Breaker, this is Air One.
-
- Run!
Go! Go!
- Get everybody upstairs! Now!
- Guys, that's our cue.
Division One, upstairs! Right now!
On the double! Let's go!
-
- Where are you?
It's unbelievable, all that snow.
And watch it end up
being a beautiful day.
You want my confession first?
- Yeah. It's Daddy.
-
- Is that your daddy?
Not yet, Max.
We have him. Max Payne is alive.
He's okay. We got him.
It's good to have you back.
Hey.
