We need a pollution revolution.
And it's not going to be easy
It must be given away
to everyone.
is all around us... right here.
Water. H2O.
Two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen.
in this glass of water
to power the city of Chicago for weeks.
It's the hydrogen we're after.
Of course, we have to make it work first.
Morning!
Hey, James, how are you doing?
Hey, Eddie, cold enough for you?
It's never too cold.
Hey, Lu! You want me to set up?
Yeah, right away.
Hello, Mr Shannon.
Mr Shannon, the big man, how are you?
Alistair.
- Did you have a good trip?
- Very good.
- Hi, can I get you some coffee?
- I'm fine, thank you.
I turn on the laser here.
We should focus it in the centre of the bubble.
- How's it going?
- You didn't get my fax?
I did. I didn't understand the figures.
We need to control the bubble.
The regulator isn't working.
Eddie, did you computer-model
your work last night?
No, I was too busy building it.
We sustained fusion for 4.6 milliseconds.
Stable?
It's stable... for 4.6 milliseconds.
Let me show you. Come, come.
The power input and output
is fine at this stage.
The output drops to nothing
at stage three, so what happened?
Paul!
All right, I gotta go.
Cross your fingers, everyone.
Good luck.
Mr Chen. Initiate laser.
Initiate laser.
Hydrogen separation in progress.
Initiate hydrogen burn.
Two million kelvin and rising.
Shut it down!
It's unstable. Shut it down.
We learned something important.
We found another way that didn't work.
We need to keep our minds open
and try again.
Alistair.
- It's working.
Yeah, it's stable.
- Completely stable.
- We go tomorrow.
Lily, talk to me.
Temperature, gas flow,
acoustic drive steadied.
- The regulator has stabilised the reaction.
- Lucasz.
My spectrometer shows
stable hydrogen production.
We're getting more out than we put in.
I think you'd better sell your utility stocks.
- Whoa, Mr Chidi!
- Unbelievable!
You're going to be famous.
Thanks for everything.
We want more money!
Thanks for your trust.
I got it, I got it!
Here comes crazy Eddie!
Congratulations. I am quite impressed.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
I never agreed to keep
anything from anyone.
Mandela will get this information,
China will find out...
Go anywhere, but don't move an inch.
I can't tell you what could happen...
This is no time to be serious.
Everybody's waiting.
Come on, Alistair!
OK, everybody.
Holy shit, we did it!
Holy shit, we did it!
One love
One heart
Let's get together and...
Your battery's dead.
There's ice all over the dashboard.
- How do I get home?
- I'll get you home.
We'll take my bike.
Oh, yes, please!
Where do you live?
I live in England.
No, sorry, I live on Kimbark and 54th.
- Kimbark and 54th?
- Mm-hm.
We can't. You'll freeze to death.
Erm...
Let's take a taxi.
- Taxi, huh?
- Uh-huh.
We've got a better chance
of getting picked up by a UFO.
Mr Chen, upload everything.
I want it on the Internet tonight.
We'll wake up a lot of people.
Damn right. Really wake them up.
Barkley...
We don't have the computer model ready.
We have the frequency.
We'll send it to you in one hour.
Yeah, yeah, in one hour.
Where are you going?
Chen?
- Here we are.
- This is Alistair's house.
Isn't he sweet?
He lets me live on the third floor.
Mmm. This... way.
Is this... is this what drunk is?
You've never been drunk?
I've never been this.
Lily's too serious.
She's no fun.
I think you're fun.
Good night, Lily.
Wow!
Alistair!
Alistair!
Chen!
Chen!
Chen!
Get ready.
Shannon.
- Eddie?
- What?
Just what caused the explosion
last night is still unclear.
University officials say
this mill site had been converted
for the experimental production
of hydrogen fuel.
They say that's not supposed
to be dangerous.
One question law enforcement officials
are trying to determine
is whether foul play was involved.
As we indicate, that's unconfirmed.
But an FBI agent has said, and it was reported
by a Bureau spokesperson,
that no nuclear device went off.
There was no atomic explosion.
As far as you know,
are all your people accounted for?
Miss Sinclair? Is this all the group?
Alistair didn't come home last night.
Lu Chen is nowhere to be found.
I phoned him and he's not anywhere.
I started CPR.
I checked for breath, there was no breath.
I checked and there was no pulse.
I continued with the CPR.
Have the locals move
the perimeter back about 1,000 ft.
You got it.
Find me a friendly Federal judge.
I want wiretap orders, search warrants
on everyone that worked here.
Inspector Ford, you've taken
charge of this investigation.
Why is the FBI involved?
Eight city blocks disappeared.
The President talked to my boss at 3am.
He wants answers.
Tell me about Eddie.
Does he drink, do drugs?
No. He's just a machinist,
an undergraduate working to get his degree.
Who'd be interested in this?
Cheap, clean,
abundant energy?
Who wouldn't?
When you left the party, who was there?
Eddie.
So, Eddie, tell us again why you came back?
I'd come back for my bike.
You say you'd returned
from taking Miss Sinclair home.
Yeah. Her car wouldn't start,
so I took her home on the bus.
What is your relationship with Miss Sinclair?
Er... We work together.
I'm a machinist, she's a physicist.
I was
hired by Dr Chen.
And who is Dr Chen?
He was Dr Barkley's
project manager.
Why did he hire you?
Because I'm a physicist.
Gentlemen, what have we got here?
Sergeant?
I think we have Mr Chen in the wind.
Nick, what did you find?
It looks like he packed with a shovel.
He was in a hurry.
Dr Barkley expressed interest
in a specialist in sonoluminescence.
He knew about Dr Chen.
So through some friends
in the State Department,
I got him here and onto the team.
You have friends in the State Department?
We have influential members of the board.
Really?
Who's on the board of your foundation?
Ford.
Various scientists...
Yeah.
...and industrialists.
Your Dr Chen is missing.
Any idea where he might be?
He may be dead.
We have no comment.
Eddie Kasalivich!
You said they killed him.
Who killed him, Eddie?
You were there before the explosion.
What happened?
What are you looking for?
We're just examining
the articles on his desk.
- How are you entitled to do that?
- Annette!
They have a search warrant,
but no respect for a man's life.
I want a full inventory.
These are very important,
sensitive scientific papers.
- We'll give you copies.
- Signed, please!
I have to speak
to the university's legal counsel.
Please give Lily any help you can.
I can't stay here tonight.
- This is insane.
- They're going to think he did it.
Oh, no.
- What is it?
- It's from
Dr Lu Chen.
He wants me
to bring the rest of the information,
all the data and meet him
at the rendezvous in Shanghai.
I'm being framed.
What are you talking about?
- This isn't from Chen.
- How do you know?
- He doesn't write like this.
- Then who sent it?
I don't know who sent it.
Where's Chen?
You don't think he did it?
Let's er...
Let's get outta here, OK?
Can I help you?
I sure hope so.
We're looking for Mr Paul Shannon.
He's on the phone right now.
Excuse me, you can't go in there!
You can't go in!
I'll call you back.
What now, Agent Ford?
We've received Eddie Kasalivich's file.
He left college for disciplinary reasons.
He blew the hell out of the lab.
- This is a coincidence!
- You knew he was kicked out of school?
He resigned.
- Under some pressure?
- There was some pressure, yes.
- He blows up a building...
- Minor structural damage.
It was an interesting experiment.
It might have worked.
Didn't you think
this information was important?
I don't see the relevance.
- You don't see a small connection?
- No, Agent Ford, I don't.
The CIA tells me
Chen might be involved in espionage.
Kasalivich's past makes me nervous.
And Miss Sinclair is receiving faxes
inviting her to mainland China.
Really?
Really.
What's wrong?
That's my place.
Let's get outta here.
- It's a real shithole.
- How much does this guy make?
Not much, he's a student machinist.
- Sheen, why are you outside?
- Stay warm, buddy!
Got a loft for your mother.
Very artistic.
- Who's upstairs?
- Everybody. Half the city.
- Do you want to check that cabinet?
- I got it.
Jesus, you could put together
almost anything here.
I want all this.
All right! We need a total lab workup.
It's er... a neutron cappuccino machine.
Yeah, don't touch it.
Hey, Nick! What's this?
It's a transmitter.
It's a burst transmitter.
What does it do?
It sends massive amounts
of information by satellite
probably to China.
Nick! Doyle!
Paul.
Shannon!
What's going on?
Tell me about the money, Eddie.
What money?
The $250,000 the FBI found in your loft.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What about the burst transmitter?
Think hard.
Jesus...
I suppose you're not in communication
with Dr Chen in China?
It wasn't Chen.
- Do you have an attorney?
- No.
I've got a good one.
He'll negotiate your surrender.
Come on. We'll call him.
- Surrender?
- They'll want to talk to you.
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean?
- We didn't do anything.
- The FBI will figure that out.
We're being set up. I'm not going
to the cops until I know more.
Run, and you'll have
every gun-carrying idiot in the US after you.
Look,
talk to this lawyer.
We'll go somewhere safe
- and wait until you work it out.
- Where?
Maggie's.
We'll go to Maggie's.
OK. Have you got any money?
- $40.
- All right.
Here.
When you get there, stay put.
Don't use the phone. I'll call you.
Why is this happening, Paul?
It's gonna be all right, Eddie.
I promise you.
Wait here five minutes, then leave.
What do we know about this Shannon?
Georgetown Law,
Kennedy School of Government.
Worked for several aerospace giants.
Three years in Washington
under Reagan...
- Oh, yeah? Doing what?
- DARPA.
Defence Advanced Research
Project Administration.
Jesus! Who the hell is this guy?
He's notjust someone that runs a foundation.
There's a train at 8.40
at the Union Station to Williams Bay.
- That's where Maggie lives.
- You can trust her?
We lived and worked together.
Material witness warrants
have been issued in Illinois
for Professor Lu Chen,
Oh, my God!
What are we going to do?
We can't leave here together.
Get a cab outside. Buy two tickets.
Williams Bay. I'll meet you on the track.
Be safe.
You too.
Hey, Mike, did you see that guy?
Union Station, please.
Hey! Hey, you! Come here.
Hey!
Officer!
Hey, buddy!
Hey, you!
I got him! I got him!
It makes no sense.
If Kasalivich is just a pawn,
why has he got a burst transmitter?
What?
He's gotta be transmitting to someone.
- Unbelievable.
- What?
CPD's chasing Kasalivich
down Michigan Avenue.
Stay where you are!
He's gonna fall! Get me a boat under there!
What the hell's he doing?
He's going over!
Hey! We got guys downstairs?
- What did I tell you? He just went over.
- Stairs, over here.
Listen. How do we get him down?
Officer, if I move that bridge, he's gonna fall.
- Can he get out lower down?
- Leads down to the gear room.
- Bring the bridge down.
- He'll get crushed.
Ten-four. Bring it down slow.
- Bring the bridge down now!
- Get over there!
Hey! What's happening? Why did it stop?
Right, I want this cleared.
Let's go! Do a search!
Move it, move it!
Go! Go! Right now!
You! Back this thing outta here. Come on!
So where the hell is he?
- God! I didn't think I was gonna make it.
- Watch your step.
Don't worry, he'll be here.
You were right.
What took you so long?
The bridge was up.
All aboard!
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Thank you.
Are you sure
she's going to be up this late?
Yeah, she's usually up all night.
- She's kinda wild.
- Oh.
- I worked up here one summer.
- Oh!
Maggie.
Maggie!
Oh, my.
Tell me you didn't do it, Eddie!
I didn't do it.
Oh, it's good to see you, man.
You must be the other terrorist.
- I guess I am.
- Maggie, this is Lily.
Hi, Lily.
- Have a nice trip, Mr Shannon.
- Thank you, Bobby.
How did you get me into this hearing?
I don't have this kind of clearance.
I know a guy that knows a guy.
- Who?
- It's a guy.
Who's the guy?
Doyle, it's national security. I can't tell you.
Security concerns must be given
greater importance in industrial research.
We don't know the cause of the explosion.
And we don't know
the source of the espionage,
if indeed there was espionage.
But we do know that we are at risk.
Every idea that offers a competitive
advantage to Americans is subject to theft.
And that, gentlemen, could be catastrophic.
Mr Shannon,
over the past ten years,
this committee has approved
hundreds of millions of dollars
for your research projects
without having one good,
goddamn idea about where the hell
all the money was going.
He's talking about our tax dollars up there.
We were under the impression, Senator,
that you passed legislation
to ensure that you wouldn't know.
Or perhaps, more accurately,
that you didn't want to know.
I'm aware of the law, Mr Shannon,
thank you. I wrote it.
But I don't remember,
when I drafted it, that I anticipated
a large portion
of the south side of Chicago blown up.
What assurances can you give me
and this committee
that this event will never happen again?
None, Senator.
The incident in Chicago was tragic,
to be sure.
But sometimes that is the price we must pay
to ensure our competitive edge in the future.
We didn't intend to pay for
our space exploration programme
with the lives of ten American astronauts.
But we did.
Nevertheless,
we must not waver in our commitment
to scientific research and development.
As you gentlemen know,
there are many threats to our way of life.
And not all of them wear uniforms
and carry guns.
Mr Shannon, I want to thank you for your
appearance today before this committee.
You have spoken like a true patriot
of whom this country can be very proud.
Thank you, sir.
- I think I'm getting through.
- What about Lucasz?
He never got over
not getting his credentials.
No-one on the team could have done this.
Whoever is doing this
knows an awful lot about us.
If I hadn't have shown up,
they would have thought it was an accident.
And nobody would know
what's really going on.
Oh, my God.
- Welcome back, boss. We missed you.
- What about me?
Surveillance is up on Shannon's estate.
Cue it up, Jimmy.
Where are the files
on the Moore Foundation?
Shannon's moving.
- Is everyone here?
- Yes.
- Is it running?
- Not yet.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
FBI. I'm Agent Williams, this is Agent Lim.
So, what kind of facility is this?
I'm sorry, sir,
we're not allowed to discuss this.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Bear with me, and we'll soon get started.
Thank you.
I don't care if he's got
an appointment with Mother Teresa.
We have been waiting for him
for 35 minutes.
You're late.
This is another one of your messes, Lyman.
It's not the Peace Corps, Paul.
- Anyway, you said you had it under control.
- I did!
This thing's still not working.
You've got to call off the Bureau.
Do you understand?
I'm not sure I can do that.
There's an awful lot of explaining to do.
Where's the young man?
Kasalivich?
He's someplace safe.
I'm bringing him in today.
Paul!
If someone's going down for this,
it is not gonna be I.
Paul Shannon, please.
Maggie McDermott. We're old friends.
Washington.
Area code's Wisconsin. Checking the prefix.
Punch it up.
Maggie McDermott. She was
put through from the Chicago office.
Maggie?
Shannon, it's Eddie.
It's scrambled.
- It's him, on a payphone in Williams Bay.
- I'll get the locals.
- What are you doing?
- It's OK, it's a payphone. That fax...
I know about that.
Wait at Maggie's.
I'll send someone for you.
Lily tracked it to Beijing.
It routed through a Chinese company,
but it came from
the US Technological Business Council.
We've gotta go.
- Heard of it?
- They'll be there in an hour.
Now, Eddie!
- I gotta go. We'll come to you.
- No, don't.
Eddie. Eddie!
- Thanks.
- Good luck.
Officer. Hey, hey! Andy!
You know that guy on the news?
I saw him run up there.
Really, Maggie?
You should have brought him in
when you had the chance.
Get to the observatory, right away!
Lily! Lily!
- Eddie, it's unbelievable.
- We've gotta go.
Listen, listen. This council
lobbies for defence contractors...
- We've gotta go now. The cops are here.
- What!
Come on!
How did they find us?
Hey! Hold it right there.
Hey!
Hold it! Hey!
Stop!
Hold it!
Stop! Hold it right there.
Get your hands up.
Get 'em up!
Walk back slowly towards me.
Come on, do it!
Keep coming.
Good, hold it right there.
This is Nemitz,
on the roof of the observatory.
I've got 'em.
Aagh!
Go! Go, go, go, go!
Come on!
On the roof!
Get a medical team up here right away.
Suspect is armed!
Get in the boat!
- Eddie, what are you doing?
- Get in!
Eddie, what are you doing?
The best I can.
Get the boat!
He's on the ice!
- Are you OK?
- Yes!
He's out of our sight. 12 o'clock.
Lily, the bag! Give me the bag.
Go, go!
There's nobody in there!
I don't care.
Search all of Wisconsin if you have to.
They lost him?
We've been to C-Systems.
We can't get any information.
It used to be a government-run facility.
Now county records say it doesn't even exist.
Maybe you weren't really there.
Maybe we're not really here.
Eddie, I can't... feel my legs.
Come on.
Come on.
We've got fire, we've got fire.
Why would a policeman
shoot another policeman?
Maybe they weren't police.
Why didn't they shoot at us?
I don't know.
What a dump, huh?
- Mr Shannon.
- What?
Two FBI agents want to see you.
This is more important
than his afternoon tea.
My apologies for interrupting
your tea, Mr Shannon.
- What's Kasalivich doing in Wisconsin?
- Running away from you.
We understand he phoned you.
I counselled Eddie
to turn himself in to the authorities.
He and Miss Sinclair
shot a Wisconsin state trooper.
I doubt that very seriously.
Well... the state trooper's very dead.
Mr Shannon, these are copies
of the Moore Foundation IRS files.
Do you know what's in them?
Meagre tax records, I imagine.
We are a non-profit organisation.
The funding for your foundation
comes from a wide variety of sources.
Defence contractors,
telecommunication companies, aerospace.
It's gratifying to know
our work is appreciated.
The bulk of funding seems to come
from one Cayman Islands account.
I don't do the fundraising.
Oh, yeah. And the account is classified.
Who pays your salary, Mr Shannon?
The foundation pays my salary.
Classified accounts,
encrypted phone calls...
A man could be forgiven for thinking
that your foundation is a front for the CIA.
In that case, there may be national security
issues here that are larger than us all.
Obstructing an FBI investigation
is a federal crime.
- I know the law, Mr...
- Doyle.
National security does not include
murdering people.
Domestically, at least.
Tell your friends at Langley
that domestic is our back yard.
They're not allowed to play here.
You can keep the returns.
Nice house.
And for dinner tonight,
we have a choice of sardines...
...or sardines.
Gosh, I think I'll have... sardines.
Sardines. Beautiful choice.
So, is this how you seduce all the girls?
Only physicists with hypothermia
who are accused of being a terrorist.
Thank you.
There's a garage.
I'm going to see what's in there.
I won't be long, OK?
Your pit bull has killed
a Wisconsin state trooper.
Well, now.
Would you rather the Bureau
got the girl and Kasalivich?
First, he was a suspect.
Worst case scenario... they arrest him.
Now he's a cop-killer.
Worst case scenario, they kill
For God's sake, what possessed you
to frame him in the first place?
Two words.
Convenience... and expedience.
He saw too much, he was talking.
The poor boy was
in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I need this poor boy!
This poor boy is the only one
who knows the frequencies!
Do you understand the concept, Lyman?
Poor impulse control?
Barkley, Chen, the regulator.
That was supposed to be it!
That was all of it!
I am sick to death
of cleaning up your messes.
No, Paul, no. Yours.
Not mine.
You lost it, Paul.
Lost control, perspective.
You made it personal with these people.
Well, we'll find them.
We'll find them, and when we do
and we've got this thing working,
then, my friend, then
this young man will be a liability.
That'll be my problem.
- Our problem.
- No, Lyman.
When the time comes,
I'll handle it.
You'd better.
So what does he want us to do?
We find him and give him an injection.
Lily.
Lily!
Come on.
Leesburg, Virginia.
C-Systems.
Who are they?
Not cops.
Cops carry badges,
credit cards, pictures of their families.
If it's crowded, don't go in.
OK.
- Hi!
- Hello.
Can I help you?
I'd like to send some flowers
and a note to a friend in Virginia.
It's a little strange, Mr Shannon,
but these just arrived.
I'm not quite sure where they're from.
Here's a note.
May I see that?
Thank you.
Hold it right there, buddy.
FBI.
Step outside the van, please.
Why don't you bring
your invoice sheet out with you?
Do you know if the order
originated at this shop?
I don't think so.
I think it was a wire from Georgetown.
- Mind if I take one of these?
- No, sure.
Have a nice day.
So officially this investigation
is now code-named Steel Bomb.
We'll input the data into Rapid Start.
Look what I brought back
from the flower shop.
I think this is Kasalivich.
Spawn versus Neanderthal man, 4pm today.
What is this, a wrestling match?
Bad movie, video game?
Spawn, it's a comic-book character.
- The guy who comes back from the dead?
- Yeah, like Kasalivich.
Maybe Shannon is the Neanderthal man?
Very well may be.
Hello, Eddie.
Glad you got the flowers.
Very clever.
Are you all right?
No, not really.
I guess I can understand that.
We were at Maggie's.
Caught. We were about to be arrested.
Somebody shot the cop.
Later, two guys tried to kill us.
I've got my car outside. Follow me.
We'll go someplace we can talk.
I found this... in one of the guy's wallets.
They weren't cops.
What do you know about C-Systems, Paul?
This is not the time or the place, Eddie.
We're being watched.
Eddie,
the world isn't as simple
as we'd like it to be.
It just doesn't work that way.
Shannon, who are you?
I'm your friend, Eddie.
I may be your only friend.
Is it you, Paul?
Are you responsible for all this?
Time to go, Eddie.
You've got ajob to complete.
The experiment needs verifying.
Do your work... This will all be over.
Eddie, we're beyond that now.
Let's just get this done.
Come back to work with me.
You'll have your life back, I promise you.
You don't control our lives.
You'll have to trust me, Eddie.
Just like Alistair?
Eddie!
Eddie!
Stay here.
Get in.
She's in the hatch.
Look out!
Eddie!
Eddie!
Come on, don't do anything foolish.
Get Ford. DC police reported
a disturbance at the Science Museum
by the Neanderthal man exhibit.
CQ 493... CQ 493.
Here you are, darling. Drink this.
You're dehydrated.
Wash it out of your system.
Mr Collier and I have a few colleagues
we'd like you to meet.
Dr Holloway, Dr Hamada, and Dr Orbit.
They are very interested
to discuss your work with you.
And, of course, Dr Lu Chen.
Lu.
Lily.
We would like you and Dr Chen
to continue the work
you were doing with Dr Barkley.
- You can't be serious!
- Oh, yes.
We've been impressed with your work
for a long time.
Do you drug and kidnap everyone
whose work you admire?
No.
Dr Barkley, we left behind.
Slay the dreamer, eh, Mr Shannon?
You end up sleeping on the street.
I can't believe you'd do that.
Can you spare some change?
A quarter, what's a quarter?
Can't you see me?
Can I share your grate?
You make me sick!
We can't go in! We got kicked out!
What are all youse looking at?
Let go!
CQ 493.
What are you watching?
"Honeymooner" reruns?
Kasalivich and Barkley. Look at this.
Does he look like he's about to kill this guy
and blow the place up?
The whole thing stinks.
We've got the ballistics report back
on that trooper killed in Wisconsin.
Teflon sniper round
went through the cop's Kevlar vest.
I don't buy it.
He's smart enough to blow up the lab
but stupid enough
to leave $250,000 where we'd find it?
Are you saying some cowboy's
gone off the reservation?
$100. The kid didn't do it.
You've got a nationwide manhunt
for an innocent man.
Make sure nobody shoots him.
Next shift's going down now, OK?
Yeah, right.
Help me out on this, will you?
I've had problems with the conveyor belt.
No, I'll have Jim Zinsky work on that.
OK? All right.
If you've got any problems,
call me on channel four.
How is our young charge?
Did she say anything?
We'll soon find out, won't we?
The young lady
does appear to be cooperating.
Good.
- Gentlemen, you're just in time.
- Let's get on with it.
Miss Sinclair, Mr Chen,
please, have a seat.
Activate the H2 compressor.
On... on automatic.
Here we go.
Lucasz, what are you reading?
- Two million kelvin.
- Activate the laser.
Four million kelvin.
You don't have it. It's unstable.
Shut it down! Shut it down!
Dammit! What ajoke.
It won't work without the right frequencies.
What did he say?
He said that's what he's been
trying to tell you for days.
Look. Let's try it again in the morning, OK?
- See you back here at 8.15 tomorrow?
- I have a feeling, Dr Sinclair,
the solution will present itself.
I doubt it.
It had better
or your usefulness will soon be outlived.
Take them back to their room.
I wish you wouldn't threaten
to kill my scientists to their faces.
It might make my job easier.
Lucasz, Hamada, seal the lab!
I want to see those printouts
first thing in the morning.
- It's working?
- Yes.
- How?
- Lucasz claims he figured it out.
Lucasz?
That's his story.
When I got here, the output
was going right through the roof!
Son of a bitch!
It really does work. Ha!
Dr Shannon, take a look at that.
We've got it.
What did you do?
Nothing.
I couldn't sleep last night, sir.
I heard this voice saying,
go and check different frequencies
because we were trying
on 15 and 20 megahertz.
So I went down to the lab
and ran the experiment
and it all worked out.
So... here we are, sir.
Did you document
the regulator frequencies?
Not yet.
I'd like those on a disk... Now, sir.
None too shabby, hey, Mr Shannon?
- Doctor.
- Thank you.
Where are you going, Paul?
I'm going to check this
against the Chicago data.
I'll try to meet you at the silo.
- Wait as long as you can.
- Yes, sir.
Hello, Eddie!
I figured it was you.
Nice place you have here, Shannon.
Ten-megajoule lasers.
Particle reactors.
Congress de-funded
most of the stuff here years ago.
They made a mistake.
Is this part of the Moore Foundation?
In a manner of speaking.
Power and money.
Is that what this was all about?
I'm afraid it's more complicated than that.
He was a 60-year-old scientist
who did nothing but good
and they put a bag over his head.
It was a mistake.
I didn't want anything
to happen to Alistair.
But a decision had to be made.
So...
Who made the decision?
- You?
- That's my job.
That's what I'm paid to do.
I'm paid to do dirty work.
Work people don't want to know about.
People want to live in split-level homes.
They want microwave dinners
and colour TV.
Is that what you think?
Alistair was a dreamer.
Clean air, free energy.
Noble concepts
but we live on a planet
that is addicted to petroleum.
What happens if you dump
free energy onto the market?
World stock markets would plummet.
Our own economy would collapse.
Recession,
unemployment, war.
The world is speeding up too fast now, Eddie.
We can barely hold on as it is.
You're right, it's not working.
So we've got to try something else.
Not bury the technology, but let it out.
You let it out, but you let it out
at a pace the world can absorb.
It can absorb it now.
There's our boy.
Mr Kasalivich!
How kind of you to join us.
Give us a moment, Lyman.
Eddie and I are having a conversation.
Please! Don't let me stop you!
Who runs this place, Shannon? You?
- Or the guy with the guns?
- Well,
we are a cooperative
of sorts.
Run at the behest
of the United States government.
But without their knowledge, right?
My, my, but your friend is sharp, Paul.
All right, Eddie.
What do you want?
There are the specs for the regulator.
You can pull the frequencies
off the computer.
Now let us go.
I get it to work. You give us our lives back.
That was the deal, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, that was the deal.
I'm afraid, young man,
your position is non-negotiable.
I see.
I want to tell you this story
how I got inspired.
- I had this dream...
- No!
Hold on.
I will continue.
What's happening?
What did you just do?
I just told the FBI I was willing to surrender.
Oh, and er... I think your experiment
just got a mind of its own.
Check the breakers.
Everybody, back to your stations!
What the hell's going on, Doyle?
It started a few minutes ago...
hundreds of pages.
Technical drawings,
experiment specs, budgets,
personnel records, minutes,
mostly marked top secret.
- Where's it coming from?
- C-Systems.
It's like they dumped their mainframe
into our computers.
Here's a special love note just for you.
Jesus Christ, Kasalivich.
He's in a bunker in Leesburg
with his bomb-making buddies
and wants us to arrest him.
- Lake Geneva Radical Bomb Network?
- Sound like bullshit?
It sounds like you owe me $100.
Make sure that fax doesn't run out of paper.
- Hamada!
- Still off-line!
- Pressure?
- 500 psi and rising.
What the hell's going on?
We've lost control of the system, Lyman.
We can't shut it down.
Turn it off.
It's self-sustaining. It can't be shut down.
Al! How long before
we run out of storage capacity?
I don't know. It's accelerating.
- 20 minutes before it blows?
- Maybe less.
- Is he right?
- I'm afraid he is.
Well done, Eddie.
Well done.
You wouldn't blow it up
if you weren't sure you'd get out alive.
Sure I would.
Lyman, I think it's time
we got the hell out of here.
- No!
- Chen!
- Lily!
- Chen!
For God's sake, Lyman!
Chen! Chen!
Wait!
- Jesus Christ!
- What is wrong with you?
- Turn it off!
- That was totally unnecessary.
If you haven't got the stomach for this,
stay out of the way.
I'm going to turn down the power.
- No!
- Don't touch that!
Don't!
- The compressor's just shut down.
- Turn it back on!
- You can't.
- The computers are down.
Get out!
Get out! Everybody!
- Fix it.
- I can't now.
- Fix it!
- I can't!
I wouldn't do that, Lyman.
It will ignite the hydrogen.
It's over, Lyman. It's over.
I guess it's time to go.
Go! Go!
Give me the disk.
You two, stay!
No, Lyman! Let them go!
What possible difference can it make now?
- They stay!
- When does it end, Lyman?
Never.
Well, it's not your decision.
The decision is mine,
and I say they're coming.
You can stay with them... if you like.
We must go now.
Well, are you coming?
Come on, Paul! We've got things to do!
I'm sorry, Eddie.
- Shannon!
- Shannon!
Please!
The tanks.
OK, here's the elevator.
There's room for everybody.
I'm looking for two men.
Paul Shannon and Lyman Collier.
Hang onto them.
Our friends from the FBI
will be here presently.
Anita, we're on our way.
You two go to the north elevator.
I'll take it from here.
Come on! Come on, Lily.
Eddie, which way?
By the way, Paul, do you have that disk?
The one with the magic frequency?
Thank you so much.
You know, Paul,
maybe it's time to call it a day.
Maybe you're getting too old for this.
What do you think, huh?
But then again
what would we do?
What would we do?
I didn't tell you, Lyman,
but your retirement
had already been arranged.
Hey, hold on, hold on!
Take it up, take it up!
They got a 20 on Kasalivich?
They found the stolen truck
at the construction site nearby.
Hold on.
Eddie, look.
Get up. Come on, Reed. We've gotta go!
I thought you said the hole was clear!
Get back in the seat, Ernie.
Eddie.
Lily, get in the basket!
Get out of here. Go!
Eddie, come on!
Eddie!
Hold on, hold on, Eddie.
Come on, Eddie.
Aagh!
Come on, Eddie. Come on!
Pull it up, pull it up.
Holy... did you see that?
Whoa!
Come on, get him out of there.
Eddie Kasalivich.
Agent Ford. You got the message.
Yeah, we levelled a forest printing it.
What's it mean, Eddie?
- Plans for clean, cheap energy.
- Anybody else get this?
Hopefully, a few thousand top scientists.
- I knew I liked this kid.
- Yeah, right, Leon.
Come on.
You've got some questions to answer
in Washington for about six weeks.
- That's OK.
- We've got a lot to talk about
as long as everyone stops shooting at us.
Doyle, spilt 'em up.
I'll meet you at the office.
Ford!
Doctor Sinclair and I ride together.
All right, come on, both of you.
Anita,
take a memo.
To the Director of Central Intelligence.
C-Systems...
no longer a viable entity.
Will be in contact.
That's it.
