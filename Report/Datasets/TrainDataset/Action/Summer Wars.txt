Monday, July 26th,
Afternoon News.
This morning, the
planetary  probe "Arawashi"
moved from its orbit around
the Sun to circle the Earth.
Through Arawashi experienced
many problems during its journey,
the plans to send the
solar sample capsule
gathered from the
planetoid  Matokawa to Earth
are proceeding as scheduled.
And now for our next item.
If I'd just tried a little harder
I could've represented Japan...
That again? Just give it a re–
Hey, part-timers!  Quit slacking!
Yessir.
But it's really a shame.
Oh, shove it.
Try and find  something else to do.
Let's think up something
to do for summer vacation.
Girls! C'mon, girls!
Watermelon, fireworks, and girls. That's
what comes to mind when you say summer, right?
Watermelon and fireworks
are enough for me.
Don't be such a wimp.
I don't care either way.
Anybody up for a part-time job?
We're actually in the middle of one...
A job?
We're running additional
system maintenance on OZ.
On OZ? That's amazing!
No, no. We're just code
monkeys. It's nothing special.
I see, so you  were
already working... darn.
Isn't there  anyone who's free?
Umm, Natsuki-sempai!
If you're okay with me...
Really?
Hey, what about this?
Sorry, I don't think
I can do it after all.
No good, huh?
All you'd have to do is
follow me into the country...
Then I'll do it!
What the hell?
Then... me too!
But two's a bit much.
All I need is one.
- When are you coming?
- I'm getting on the train right now. Wait for me! Natsuki
Ah, Kenji-kun!  Over here!
Sorry I'm late.
Nah, you're right on time.
Sakuma-kun  would've probably run late.
I'll do whatever  you want.
Thanks.
For now, I just want
you to carry my stuff.
We're going to Ueda in Nagano?
It's my Grandma's birthday party.
Relatives are coming
from all over the country,
and we're really
strapped for able bodies.
But anyway, what was that
about representing Japan?
I heard about it from Sakuma-kun.
He said you  almost made it.
What kind of contest was it?
A math Olympiad.
An Olympiad?  What's that?
So you're good at math, huh.
Umm, I guess.
Math is all I'm really  good at.
Calculate something.
Okay. Sempai,  when were you born?
Me? July 19th, 1992.
It was a Sunday.
July 19th, 1992  was a Sunday.
Did you memorize all that?
No.
It's something called modular
calculation, and... was I right?
Sorry.
I don't know what day it was.
Ueda, Ueda.
It's Grandma's  90th
birthday this year, so...
I see, she was born in 1920!
She's lived very long, hasn't she?
Natsuki-chan?
Natsuki-chan!
Noriko-obasan!
Long time no see!
She's the 16th  head
of the Jinnouchi clan.
The 16th?
There are even graves from all the way
back to the Muromachi era on our grounds.
The clan struck it  big trading in silk
during the Meiji era,
but our late grandfather
practically burned  through
all that money and...
Yumi-san!
Natsuki-chan!
The country's changed so much!
Nothing's left from what we used to have. Not
the mountains, not the stores, not the factories.
But still, you should see the
letters that grandmother gets.
Nearly all of them are from company
presidents and famous politicians.
Natsuki-chan!
Nana-san!
You know, sometimes
grandmother gets really scary.
She's the daughter of
a warrior clan, see.
You'd better  watch out.
What is this place?
You must all be tired
from the journey here, hmm?
Come, there's ice-cold
watermelon inside.
I love watermelon!
Let's go!  Hurry!
Uhh, congratulations  on
your ninetieth birthday.
It's my mother's birthday, actually...
- Kenji-kun!
- Right!
Sorry to spring this on you suddenly,
but try to humor Grandma no
matter what she says, okay?
Humor her?
Mother?
Come in.
Grandma!
- So you've come.
- It's been so long!
Are you feeling all right?
As you can see, I'm doing fine.
They said you were feeling weak...
It was just the heat.  Don't worry.
I'm so relieved.
Hello.
Remember our promise, okay?
Who is this young man?
His name is Koiso Kenji.
Pleased to meet you.
I know Natsuki-sempai from
our high school physics club...
That is...  He's my boyfriend.
Boyfriend?
Right. My
husband-to-be.
Husband-to-be!
Right.
Husband-to-be.
Really.
Well? I told you  I'd
bring him, didn't I?
Uh? What's going...
- Kenji-san.
- Yes'm!
This child is yet  immature and naive.
Are you confident  that
you can make her happy?
Ah, umm,
that is...
Well...
I asked whether or not
you have what it takes!
Yes...
Truly?
Yes, well...
Would you give your life for her?
...Yes.
That's good to hear.
Oh, right.
What is it?
A present.
A morning glory patterned yukata!
Thank you!
Kenji-san,  pleased to meet you.
No, the  pleasure is mine!
Sorry!
I can't do it!
I'll explain  what
the job's about again.
I'm telling you I can't do it!
You just have to pretend that you're my boyfriend
in front of Grandma and the rest of my relatives.
No, no, no, no!
I can't do it!
I've never even  gone
out with a girl before.
I'm begging you!
Grandma was always so healthy, so when I
heard she was sick I panicked and told her,
"I'll bring my boyfriend to see
you, so don't die." It was a promise.
Okay? You understand, right?
Ri, right. I understand what you want.
Thanks!
Okay, from now on call me
"Natsuki-chan" instead of "sempai."
It's part of your back story.
Back story?
You're attending Tokyo U,
you're from a distinguished clan,
and you just got back from studying
abroad in America... should be about it.
Tokyo U, distinguished
clan, studied abroad...
That's everything I'm not!
- Got it?
- No, I can't do it!
No no no no!
And here you said you'd do anything.
C'mon, just for four days.
Then I can  just tell
them we broke up later.
Please!
You're getting old, aren't you?
Jinnouchi Fishery
Thanks for  the ride.
Sis, your helmet!
And out!  The game is over!
Making a remarkable last-minute comeback
thanks to the pitcher Jinnouchi...
Yeaaaah!
- He wooon!
- Yeaaah!
What is it? Did he win?
Ryouhei-niichan's awesome!
I'm telling everyone!
- Me too!
- Me too!
Unexpected indeed!
A miracle has taken place!
What do you mean,
"unexpected?" Honestly!
Ryouhei-niichan won!
Oh, that's great!
Be sure to tell Grandma too.
Yeah!
Let's go!
Natsuki!
Where are you, Natsuki?!
What's all the  shouting for, Shouta?
A fiance!
Over my dead body!
Dammit, I should've been on my guard!
- Ryouhei-niichan
won!  - He won!
That's great!
And here's something to celebrate!
- What is it?
- What is it?
Behold!
Squid!
Aha!
More squid!
Voila!
Uhhh...
Only squid?
Well...
I'll introduce everyone.
Family  Tree
First is great aunt Mariko from the main branch
and her children aunt Rika and uncle Riichi,
and then here's great uncle Mansuke
and uncle Tasuke, aunt Naomi.
Aunt Kiyomi and  uncle
Tasuke's son Shouta.
Over here is great uncle
Mansaku who has three sons.
Uncle Yorihiko's wife  aunt Noriko,
uncle Kunihiko's wife  aunt Nana,
uncle Katsuhiko's wife  aunt Yumi,
aunt Yumi's children
Yuuhei and Kyouhei,
aunt Nana's daughter Kana,
and aunt Noriko's
children  Shingo and Mao.
- Got it?
- Uhh...
Umm, that's...
Well anyway!
Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you.
Let's have a drink.
So Grandmother gave
you the green light, hmm?
And every guy I ever brought home
got turned down just like that.
But come on, he's loaded, goes
to Tokyo U, even studied abroad!
Perfect, isn't he?
Really. Almost too  good to be true.
You two spinsters
should be taking notes!
Shut up!
- What's wrong with being divorced?
- I'm happy being single!
So, young man. How're the
plans coming along for children?
What?
You know, children.
What're you bringing that up
for, you perverted old man?
He only came to say introduce himself.
Eh? But doesn't that mean
that he's done it with  Natsuki-chan?
Am I wrong?
Come, you're a college student, aren't
you? How far have you two gotten?
Shush!
Nothing wrong with a bit of friendly
teasing for soon-to-be family, eh?
What do you mean, soon-to-be
family, grandpa? I won't allow it!
Shouta, that's enough.
You shut the hell up!
Is that any way to
speak to your own father?
I'll have you know I watched over
Natsuki since she was just a little kid.
That was years and years ago.
He's got to get permission from
me. I'm her second cousin, you know.
And since when did second cousins
have any say in things like that?
But still!
It's fine, as long as
mother's  given her blessing.
That's everything  in our household.
Grandma, are you
really sure about this?
Of course.
Kenji-san is excellent  groom material.
My eyes are sharp as ever.
A Jinnouchi man has to
be solid and trustworthy!
How could he guard his family
and his lands if he were not?
Hear, hear!
The men of Jinnouchi  must be strong!
After all, we of the Jinnouchi were once
soldiers of the awe-inspiring Takeda army!
Here he goes again.
After Takeda's army was defeated his
retainers scattered to the four winds,
and our once glorious
past was in shambles.
But our ancestors fought
bravely in many wars
to hold the land  they'd found in Ueda.
August 2nd, 1585!
Just 2000 of  our ancestors
clashed against 7000
of Tokugawa's elite!
That was  the first battle of Ueda!
Right in one!
It was a crafty,  wily war!
The enemy thrust forth into
the center of the village,
and there our ancestors took
advantage of the terrain,
driving the enemy to
the river's banks...
Turn around.
Why did I have to lose that
game of rock-paper-scissors?
I have to admit I'm jealous.
Pretending to be her boyfriend, huh?
There's nothing  to be
jealous of. It's just a job.
So come on,  how is it? Fun?
I'm surrounded by strangers.  It's hard.
Oh, sure. As if.
You're sleeping under the same roof as
Natsuki-sempai, the prettiest girl in school!
Since you're pretending to be her boyfriend anyway,
you might as well ask to share the same room.
Wh-what?!
There's no way that'd fly!
Well, best of luck.
Huh? Where am I?
Now that I look at it,
this is one big house.
What do you want?
Uhh, I'm just a little lost.
The bathroom's  around
the corner to your right.
Thanks.
Shouldn't you  be with everyone else?
Mommy!
You haven't toweled off yet.
Kana...
S-s-sorry!
The bathroom's free.
You should take a bath.
No, I, that is, I don't
need to, not today, umm...
Natsuki-sempai's  been in this tub...
- It was a tie!
- A tie!
Hayate, it's me.
Have you forgotten me?
Why are you here?
What do you mean by
that?  This is my home.
Like hell  it is!
Fiery as ever,  aren't
you, Mariko-obasan.
Things haven't changed a
bit since ten years ago.
The same goes for you.
Is that any  way to act,
showing your face for the
first time in a decade?
What's the  occasion?
The birthday  celebration is on Sunday.
Whose?
Wabisuke.
Wabisuke?
Hey, granny.  Still alive?
I should say the same. I was worried
you'd had an accident somewhere.
That attitude would keep
you breathing past a hundred.
Have you...
had anything to eat?
I'm not hungry.
Japan's really  a bore.
Humid and  hot summer,
narrow roads,
and full to bursting  with people.
But at least the  beer's great.
Ojisan?
Wabisuke-ojisan!
Natsuki?
Is that you, Natsuki?
Awesome!  You came back!
Natsuki!  Let go of him.
Why?  Come on...
It's already been a decade, huh.
Like they say, time flies.
Umm... who is  Wabisuke-san, exactly?
You've never met him
before, have you, Nana-chan?
It's a complicated story.
It's not complicated
at all. He's family.
Long story short he's the
son of Grandfather's mistress.
Really?
It was commonplace
back in the old days.
He sold the deed  to
Grandma's mountains,
took the money and  ran
all the way to America!
He's a horrible,  selfish man.
Really?
You haven't  married yet?
Then, do you have a girlfriend?
Why would  you want to know?
Great.
I'll come visit  you in America soon.
You can take me  to the Disney resorts.
First California,  then Florida.
And then we'll go back  to your place.
Give me your phone
number so I can call you.
If you win.
Huh? Come on!
That's more fun, isn't it?
Fine...
Hah!
Want to stop?
Not yet.
Koi koi!
I see. Then, my turn.
Going for 4 bright, hmm?
N-not really...
What a shame!
Ah, koi koi?
Nope.
Come on!
I win.
Now, time for  you kids to go to bed.
I don't wanna.  One more?
I like to  cut and run.
Take it from here.
I haven't figured  out the rules yet...
Hey, how long are you going to stay?
Dunno.
Just don't leave at all!
Right? Got it?
What am I  doing here?
What is this?
Got it!
What was that?
Let's see how she's doing...
- Get up!
- Get up!
Wake up already!
Get uuup!
The damage is quite extensive, yes.
What what what what what?
Look!
That's him, isn't it?
Dead certain. He's the culprit!
The culprit is a minor? A student!?
Now, the more I look at him,
the younger he seems to be.
He must be a high schooler, right?
That's...
that's me!
This young man has managed to infiltrate
OZ's system and plunge it into chaos.
It'll be quite a while until
things are back to normal.
The attack seems to have
been carried out on a whim.
A pleasure crime, then. I did notice that
I couldn't read my mail in the morning.
You know, there are almost as many OZ
subscribers as there are cell phone users.
Since every aspect of everyday life,
from shopping to taking care of business
will be affected by this
attack, it seems certain that
punishment will be unavoidable even
if it was only a pleasure crime.
What's a pleasure crime?
Something that feels good?
What's so funny over there?
Breakfast time!
- Hey! Gimme–
- No!
Hang on! No! Give me that! Give it back!
Criminal, criminal!
Give it to me!
He's evil!
It's not me!
Huh?
Time to eat!

You may attempt to log in 2 more times.
Huh?
Unable to access the OZ Family network.
You may attempt to log in 1 more time.
Huuuh?
Why?
Where was it again...
There!
Are you behind this?
Hey, lemme use your PC!
I don't like the way you asked.
Ask like you'd ask  a business partner.
Excuse me, but may I please
use your computer for a moment?
Thanks!
Why?
What's wrong?
I think my  account's been hijacked!
So you've been framed, huh.
What do I do?
Call customer support.
That's right!
Hello? He–
Your OZ account has
not been authenticated,
so you cannot peruse
your cellular phone.
I can't call them!  It won't work!
Calm down.
Koiso-kun.
I told you, calm down.
It's a Sakuma-san calling from Tokyo.
Don't tell me you're behind this.
Of course I'm not!
Figured. You don't have the motive or
the guts to pull off something like this.
All right, already! Help me out!
Ain't gonna happen.
The password's been changed. I
can't connect to the control sector.
I thought OZ's security was
supposed to be world class!
A strange e-mail was spread
all through OZ yesterday.
A strange e-mail?
OZ's security is locked
with a 2056 number code.
It can't be hacked  so easily.
But it looks like someone managed
to crack the code in just one night!
What's the first number?
Eight.
That....  that was me.
I solved it.
What?
I just thought it was some
kind of math problem and...
So you cracked it?  You idiot!
Sorry.
Awesome.
Whatever. I made a guest avatar
for you using that phone number.
It's better than  nothing, right?
Use that until this
stuff's been settled.
This...  is me?
This is an announcement from OZ.
Some of our services
are currently unavailable.
We repeat.
This is an announcement from OZ.
Some of our services are
currently unavailable.
Hello?  Excuse me!
Please stop playing
around with my avatar.
This person's  framing me!
My account's  been stolen!
Just who is he,  anyway?
What do you find so funny
about wreaking havoc like this?
It's not right to do whatever you
want just because it's the Internet!
Battle mode?
But it should only be
active in certain areas...
This is bad.
The regulations of every
field have been altered.
In a language I can
understand, please...
All of OZ has been
made into a battleground!
Run away!
Um, let's talk this over.
Let's talk this over!
Defend yourself!
What're you doing?  Move it.
That's...
King Kazma!
Awesome.
So you're...
Don't talk to me.  I can't concentrate.
You got him!
He's just a scrub.
There he is!
We've found the criminal!
Right! Arrest him!
Arrest him!
Grab him!
Stop it!
Save me!
It...
transformed.
Damn it! Damn it!
This bastard...
Are you playing a game?
Lemme play too.
Outta the way!
That was close.
You almost lost  your account, too.
Here we go.
And, go!
You sing too,  Wabisuke-ojisan!
I'll pass.
Leave him be.
Ojichan,  what're you looking at?
Women with big tits.
What were you doing in America?
I was a ninja.
Really?
I think I've found the real culprit.
Not human?
What do you mean, not human?
It's an A.I.
An artificial intelligence.
It looks like an experimental
hacking A.I. under development
in Pittsburg managed  to break loose.
Break loose?
It's called "Love Machine."
Love Machine?
I wish I could  ask him to stop.
Honestly, I'm going crazy
without my cell phone.
If Ryouhei advances  to the nationals,
let's all go visit a hot
spring!  I'll pay for everyone.
Sounds good.
Haven't I seen that face somewhere?
Natsuki!
What's going on here!
I just ran a search on his personal file through
the district office's OZ, and what's this?
He's not from an old clan at all!
He's just some  salaryman's son!
And a high schooler at that!
He's younger than you are!
I just got
this fax. Look!
Tokyo U?
Studied abroad? Ha!
Umm, well...
Now for our next item.
The planetary probe Arawashi's capsule
has failed to detach from the main body.
King Kazma, the weakest ever!!
What is this stuff? It's unbelievable.
Don't let it get to
you.  It's just a game.
It's not a game.
It's a sport.
Huh?
I like the fighting  and winning part,
not the gaming part.
I see.
But he's different.
He likes to play games.  I can tell.
Then... what's  he after?
There he is!
There he is!
They found out.
Uhh, Sakuchousei High's
are no laughing matter,
but I believe that we'll
secure the title in the end.
Go, Ueda High!
Why did you lie about this?
Did you think your grandmother
would be happy with lies?
I thought that something was
fishy when I heard his specs.
Though if you're looking for a Tokyo U graduate
who's from an old clan, and studied abroad,
I can think of someone who
fits the bill in our own family.
That's right, Wabisuke.
You're right, but what's
that got to do with anything?
Wait.
Do you think Natsuki's
first crush was...
Right! She always liked
to hang around Wabisuke.
She used to say she loved him even
back when she was in kindergarten.
She even wrote an essay
called "Ojjisan and I."
Noooo!
Stop it!
Just forget about it!
So that's how it was, huh.
Either way!
The real issue here is
that this guy's a criminal!
He's got a point.
We can't have someone
like that staying here.
You're a cop, aren't you?
Not gonna arrest him?
Oh, yeah.
Cool.
He's really being arrested!
Don't stare!
Time is 12:30pm.
The charges  are... uh...
Was that really you  on the news?
I don't know the
specifics  of what went on,
but was that  really you?
- I'm innocent.
- There'll be time for making excuses later!
Hey!
I'm sorry it had  to end like this,
but I really  enjoyed my time here.
Let him speak.
My father was always
away on business trips,
and my mother held
down a full-time job too,
so I was always  alone at home.
Having dinner as a family,
playing hanafuda...
this was the first time in my
life I've ever felt so warm.
I was happy.
Thank you  for your hospitality.
Thank you,  everyone.
- You're welcome.
- Bye bye!
Natsuki-sempai.
Natsuki-sempai!
Shut up!
On the mound is  Ueda High's Jinnouchi.
No hits and no runs so
far!  Give them hell!
Go, go, go, go!
Jinnouchi  winds up and–
Huuuh?
We interrupt this broadcast
to bring you breaking news.
I don't care about  Arawashi!
- Yumi-chan.
- Yes!
We're going to  have
a lot of guests today.
There's lots to do,  so come help.
Okay.
This car  isn't a patrol car, is it?
- Shut up!
- Sorry!
- Oi!
- Yes!
Why aren't they moving?
It's a green light!
I'm sorry!
You're not even close
to getting here? Why?
The GPS navigator's on the fritz.
We're around Saitama but the
screen says we're in Hokkaido.
And the traffic's brutal.
I can't say when  we'll get there.
You can't say?  The party
is only two days away!
It's fine. The hubbie's on his
way overnight on the Shinkansen.
Tell Natsuki  too, will you?
And it's a hit!  The batter's off!
He just barely makes
it to 1st base! Safe!
My apologies. I don't think I'll
be able to leave Tokyo today.
You too, Kazuo-san? What's the matter?
Someone's messed  with
the water pressure.
The underground gas pipes
and power lines are in danger.
Tell Natsuki I'll try and make it
over on the Shinkansen tomorrow.
This won't do!
I've already finished
the seating arrangements!
The sacrifice bunt  is a success! Safe!
Make way for the  ambulance, please.
Can't make it? How come?
Emergency alerts from elderly living
alone are going off all over Matsumoto.
Fat chance of that happening, huh.
Huh? Over in Suwa too?
We got a call and we're
on the scene right now,
but there's no fire.
This has been  going on all day.
But you worked overtime too, didn't you?
We still have to check.  You never know.
We can't afford to
miss a real emergency.
The ship's docked at  the wrong harbor?
Things are chaotic in Nagoya too?
You can't make it?
Kazuma's waiting.
You're going back?  To Sendai?
You need to go to the bathroom?
Right,  it's never
healthy to hold it in.
Don't sweat it.
Fine, I'll tell
Mariko-obasan  you can't come.
Hey, Kajitoshi-ojisan from
Matsuyama says he can't...
Huh?
Why is everyone suddenly
saying they can't make it?
What's going on?
And look at the pitcher, Jinnouchi!
With no outs and bases
loaded, he's in dire straights!
Dammit! What's up with this!
Lunchtime's almost over!
Turn around!
They say traffic's
jammed  for 60 kilometers.
If Natsuki hadn't asked,
you would've been in for it!
What's  going on?
- Terrorism?
-Huh?
Welcome home.
What're you  doing back here?
I'm sorry, well...
Did you forget something?
No, well...
Use the on  board GPS.
Call the fishermen's union too.
Didn't Yorihiko and his brothers say
they were going to try hashigo-nori?
Ain't the time to worry about that.
And I ordered the birthday dumplings
to match the number of guests, too.
It's iffy whether or not they
can even deliver the dumplings.
What?
Nobody seems to  care about the party!
I've been making
preparations since last month!
Love Machine's behind all of this.
It can steal any account
it wants with that password.
Account?
Your identification on OZ.
OZ supports so many
real-life services that
an account's authority is
effectively the same as its owner.
You can use a water official's account
to change the city's water system,
and a Japanese Railways Group employee's
account to turn a train around.
There're more than a billion
subscribers worldwide.
Countless organizations
use OZ accounts to work.
Looks like OZ's security
system has backfired on them.
Right.
With the US President's account you
might even be able to launch a nuke.
What?
This is all because of me.
All me...
I should really arrest you right now!
Due to severe traffic congestion, even
emergency vehicles are unable to move about.
We ask that all commuters
please make way for them.
This is almost like an  enemy invasion.
What's an enemy?
People's lives may  be in danger.
Hello, what's your emergency?
Huh? Grandma!
Why're you calling an  emergency number?
Yorihiko! Make sure to
visit all the elderly! Got it?
Kunihiko! This is no time
to be lazing about! Move it!
Understand, Katsuhiko? This is a battle.
- I'll do what I can.
- What you can? Huh?
Kan-chan? It's me, Sakae.
It's been a while, hasn't it?
I'm asking as a fellow
retainer of the Takeda clan:
what kind of emergency
plan is the MLIT setting up?
What? You're just now
planning a meeting to discuss?
Don't give me that bullshit!
Sone-yan? Get some
medical  people together
and help the emergency
workers. Even the retired ones.
It's your fool of a son's chance to finally
be some help to the world with that NPO of his.
Itomi-san, it's important
that everyone communicates
with one another like the old days.
That's your  specialty, isn't it?
Sen-san, your decisions are
going to be crucial here.
I know it's not easy,
but it's not worth  people's lives.
Don't call me sensei,
just listen to an old  woman's request.
Why're you bringing up
those long gone days, kiddo?
It's been half a century
since I beat you up.
Thousands, no, tens of thousands
of people are in danger.
If you don't step up
now,  then when will you?
Don't give up.
No matter what, you can't give up.
This is something  only you can do.
You can do it.
I'm telling you, you can.
Right, that's the spirit.
The man she's talking
to is the chief of Police.
Incredible.
Everyone's listening
to  what she has to say.
Am I deaf?  Don't get uppity with me.
Check to make sure your dentures
aren't falling out first!
I'm not that old yet!
OZ's engineering team
is out in full force,
but they still haven't even
gotten close to the control sector.
Try and type in something.
An encrypted code should pop up
if you enter the wrong password.
This is a code?
You can do it!
You can!
What the hell is he?
Japan's representative
in the math Olympiads.
Almost, that is.
I'm done!
We're in!
Sad news, Kenji.
Huh?
Looking into the security
logs in the database,
to crack the code yesterday,
but your  name isn't among them.
What? Why?
You got the last letter  wrong! BZZZT!
What?  Dammit, you're not the culprit?
But it looks like everyone who sent
in a reply had their avatars stolen.
Hey, cheer up.
You got it right this time.
And so, though there was
much confusion nationwide,
thankfully there were no casualties.
The trouble was caused by
a system error brought about when two
identical accounts were accidentally generated.
It has been announced,
however, that it is
technologically impossible to purposely
misuse OZ's system for malicious intent.
Here we are recapping the 10th day of the Nagano
High School Baseball tournament, with Ueda High...
Everyone quiet down a moment!
Though both teams scored many
runs in the final innings,
Ueda High defeated  Sakuchousei High
and has advanced to the
finals, to be held tomorrow.
- Great!
- Hooray!
Beats me how they managed to win
letting 30 hits through, though.
It's a miracle!
You can tell when he thinks he's gonna
lose. It's written all over his face.
Like father, like son, eh?
Natsuki, what about  your mom and dad?
Dad's pulling an all-nighter
with repairs on the water pipes.
Mom's still  in Saitama.
She's staying the night
at a business hotel.
I see. That's good.
It's all thanks to Grandma
giving everyone orders
that this whole thing
calmed down quickly.
Right, Grandma?
I never gave  anyone orders.
Oh, come on!
Our Grandma's great!
Japan's best!
You rascals.
Kenji-san, I hear you stepped
up to the occasion today as well.
No, I...  I didn't really...
Natsuki's boyfriend?
He's not her boyfriend!
I hear he fixed  the problem with OZ.
I thought he was still a high schooler!
Not bad, boyfriend.
I'm telling you, he ain't her boyfriend!
What do you care about it?
And now for an update on the OZ
incident which took place this morning.
Though the system has been restored,
over 2 million accounts in  Japan alone
are still inaccessible.
Though the cause is not  yet clear,
the government has advised all OZ users
to take care in managing their accounts.
What is it?
It's about OZ...
But...
Love Machine  hasn't been beaten yet.
That's right.
Love Machine?
What's that? Morning Musume?
An A.I. that steals accounts.
- What?
- Let's see.
It's got  a creepy avatar.
Has bad guy written all over him.
So this thing's behind all
the stuff that happened today.
But why wasn't this
reported in the news?
I think it's just a
matter of time, Master.
The Internet's everywhere,
and the people who've noticed what's
going on are already talking about it.
If we pool our knowledge and
resources, we should be able to stop it.
Sorry, but that's  not gonna happen.
How do you know that?
How? Well...
I'm the one who developed  that thing.
You made Love Machine?
Yeah.
It's a hacking A.I. that I designed.
I just did one thing.
I gave a machine the urge  to know.
Then the military of
some country  came to me,
and asked me to sell it to them
so they could run some tests.
I didn't think those tests would  be OZ.
Doesn't matter, I guess.
The results are outstanding.
That thing's urge to know
will make it keep collecting information
and authority from across the world.
As of now, Love Machine holds the
same power as an army millions strong.
Got it? That's  why you can't win.
Do you know how many
people were hurt today?
Do you know how much
confusion was caused?
You're saying it's my fault?
Of course not. The A.I. did it.
The world's in chaos  because of you!
You guys just don't get it, do you.
- I said that the A.I.–
- You really think that makes it okay?
Don't do it.
You're a coward  hiding
behind that excuse!
Calm down!
I'm telling you!
I just developed the damn thing, I never told
the artificial intelligence to do anything!
Shut up!
Stop it! What do you think
you're doing with Grandma here?
Wabisuke.
- What's the hubbub?
- Ssh!
You understand, right, Grandma?
I'm sorry for all the trouble
I've caused you up to now.
I've been working to
make it all up to you.
so that I could come back to
this house with my head held high.
Grandma, look at this.
The American military's
given me an official contract.
We're going to get  more money
than even Father managed to earn.
This is all thanks to you, Grandma.
I was able to develop it
with the money you had, see.
Mother!
Run!
Wabisuke!
Pay the price for your crimes!
I shouldn't have come back.
Ojisan!
Natsuki!
Listen up, you all!
We must take care of the
problem caused by one of our own!
Sempai.
Natsuki-sempai.
Don't come near me.
I'm not in the mood to talk right now.
These legs of mine just
won't listen to me anymore.
You shouldn't  have
exerted yourself so much.
Thank you.
Then, I'll be going now.
Do you want to play a game of hanafuda?
The whole family used  to play together,
but these days it's hard to find
someone willing to play against me.
You can go first.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry you had to see
that embarrassing spectacle.
It's nothing.
Even Natsuki's  foolishness.
Koi koi.
- Not bad.
- Thank you.
Now if  I win this round...
You have to have something
on the line to make it fun.
There, koi koi.
All right then... If I win,
I want you to take care of that girl.
She's still too  immature
to be a good fiancee,
but if you can look  past those faults,
I want to ask  you one more time.
Take care  of Natsuki.
I...
I don't yet have that
kind of faith in myself.
You can do it.
All I can offer is
that  I'll do my best.
I win!
- Oh no! Get over here!
- I'm coming!
Quickly!
Grandma!
Open your eyes!
Grandma!
Wake up!
Grandma!
Grandma, can you hear us?
Grandma!
Please wake up!
- Switch with me.
- That's enough.
No, Katsuhiko!  Keep going!
It's no use.
Keep going!
Everyone's here, right?
She was taking  heart medicine.
I used this to monitor
the state of her body.
Her heartbeat, blood
pressure, perspiration.
An alarm should have rung
if anything went wrong,
but I stopped receiving
data last night.
The trouble in OZ?
I guess the system manager's ID
was one of the stolen accounts.
That means she'd  have
lived if not for that!
No, I think it was just her time to go.
What? Like hell it was!
Where's Wabisuke?
I'll beat the living
daylights out of him!
I think he took Shouta's
car and left last night.
Nobody knows  how to contact him,
because he's been gone for ten years.
Damn it!
Excuse me.
Stop them.
The tears...
Hold me here.
Make them stop.
Now for our next item. The
number of people unable to access
their OZ accounts  since
yesterday's incident
has reached over 10   million worldwide.
Has anyone told Ryouhei?
We decided to wait  until
after tomorrow's match.
Yeah.
Today's going to be a busy day.
Noriko-chan,
Yumi-chan, Nana-chan.
I'll leave the cooking to you.
I hope there'll be  enough sake.
Mansaku,  I want you
to visit the temple,
and Yorihiko, I want you and your
brothers to tell the neighbors and guests,
and find some people
willing to help out.
Everyone understand?
Ain't we got more
important things to do?
That's right, mother!
The birthday dumplings!
We've got to change the
order to funeral dumplings.
To hell with the dumplings!
We've got to strike back!
We have to bash that
machine to bits! Right?
Honestly, that's enough.
What?
You're no help  at all, little brother.
What does age have  to do with anything?
We of the Jinnouchi have to raise
our battle standards and fight!
What's gotten into you, dad?
We have to hold Grandma's funeral first.
That's not as important!
Wouldn't she want us to
fight and avenge her honor?!
Umm.
I agree.
Up till now, we never realized
that what happened in OZ
could endanger the
lives of real people.
He's dangerous.
Something like what happened
here could happen anywhere else.
So we, at least,  have to stop him.
What're you talking about?
That is, we have to stop any
more people from getting–
Who're you to be sticking your
nose into our family matters, huh?
But...
How can we worry about other
people on a day like this?
But...
Well then, everyone!
I'm ashamed of the lot of you.
How can you say  you're Jinnouchi men?
I understand how you feel, father,
but it's about time you acted your age.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't
have spoken out of turn...
No, you were right.
You have to protect
others to protect yourself.
Is that the JSDF motto?
No... it's a line from
"The Seven Samurai."
Tasuke-ojisan.
Hmm?
Do you stock computers  at your store?
Of course.
Do you have any better  than this?
Of course we do.
Kazuma-kun.
We need to fight him.
This is revenge.
Honestly, that Mansuke. What
in the world was he thinking?
There aren't any good pictures here.
Hey, how about this one?
Ah, this was the one taken
for that one award ceremony.
That'll do the trick.
April 1600,
Tokugawa Hidetada's  army of 38,000
struck at Ueda Castle.
Our forces at the time
numbered a paltry 2,000 men.
Then how did our
ancestors face this battle?
After deliberately luring
the enemy into the castle,
they closed and locked the
gates, trapping them inside.
Trapped like rats,  Tokugawa's army
lost its will to fight
and was defeated.
That was the  second siege of Ueda.
Did that help any?
That's a good idea.
Then with that in mind...
Hello, Sakuma?
What're you starting now?
A war.
Do you think this will do
for the bedside decorations?
Well, I guess it will do.
Even though she's passed on,
her face looks so peaceful.
It does.
I dunno if this'll fit.
You have things  like this in stock?
"Electronics store" doesn't
just mean household appliances.
Actually we sell stuff to schools
and government agencies too.
This was actually
slated for a university.
Is it okay to use it?
It's fine. We're just
borrowing it for a bit.
But why did he  suddenly decide on this?
It's all thanks to you standing
up to the women, Kenji-kun.
Kazuma must've  seen
that as a motivator.
The women of our  clan
are strong and assertive,
so the menfolk  tend to be more passive.
Now I need a source of electricity...
Outta the way!
Great, isn't it? This is my boat.
Takes 2 hours to  get here from Niigata.
It can put out up  to 300 kilowatts!
Watch out, you two.
I'm gonna  dunk it.
Incredible.
What is this?
A military-grade  antenna module.
Borrowed it from the
American base in Matsumoto.
What exactly do you  do
in the JSDF, Riichi-san?
That's classified.
What's gotten  into those men?
- It's a big jeep!
- Look outside!
Don't make such a commotion!
Behave yourselves, children.
Okay.
Is it all right for us to
just sit around like this?
It's the mourning period.  Calm down.
I keep thinking  about my work.
Forget that for now.
That's not going to work.
Grandma always told us to
help those in need, didn't she?
That's right.
Everyone! Please  listen to me!
Yummy.
Can't you help a little too, Naomi-san?
I can't make food  this good.
What time is it?
It's time!
Yumi-san!
Kazuma!  Change your clothes, will you?
Later.
Kazuma-kun looks like
he's  really King Kazma.
That child used  to be quite weak.
He learned Shaolin kung fu from his
grandfather Mansuke  in Niigata
through OZ all the way from Nagoya.
So that's why he  called him Master.
Don't touch anything!
I mean it!
We're not touching nothing!
We're just looking!
Keeping it cool's gonna be the problem.
We don't have an air conditioner.
I've got lots of ice in the boat.
Follow me.
LCD's response times are too slow.
Do you have any  HD CRT monitors?
Course I do.
Just what kind of people is
Natsuki-sempai's family made of?
We're just a normal civilian family.
A 200 teraFLOPS supercomputer,
and a 100 gig military-grade
connection line.
You're telling me that a normal
family has that kinda stuff?
I want to send a challenge.
A challenge?
Sent by  King Kazma.
"Don't expect it to
be  so easy this time."
And how do you know that?
Because I'm King Kazma.
Tell me another one.
Wait, really?
Come to the OZ Coliseum today
at noon . King Kazma
Master.
Do you think I can win?
You're all grown up now.
You can decide the  outcome by yourself.
Grown up? But I'm only in middle school.
You'll be a big brother soon.
I didn't choose to be.
And a little sister at that...
It's not so bad  having siblings.
Even though you steal
each other's snacks,
fight every day,
get sick of even  seeing their faces...
One minute left!
I'm ready.
Me too.
We can win this time.
Grit your teeth.
Let's go together.
The finals are now beginning.
Ueda High is up against the
favorites Matsushou Academy!
If Ueda High can win this
match, they'll advance
to the nationals for the
first  time in 24 years.
But Matsushou's quite strong.
Will Ueda be  able to pull it off?
Grandma, please watch  over Ryouhei!
And we're just  about to start!
He came!
Yeah!
He's fast...  he's really fast!
I can do it.
Don't let him run!
Get him to the trap!
I can take  care of him by myself!
He's controlling the  stolen avatars.
He can do  that?
Don't do it, Kazuma-kun!
Run!
Master!
I'll keep him occupied, run!
Master!
I'm fine,  get him to the trap!
Got him.
Sakuma!
Right on schedule!
We got him, Grandmother!
Kazuma did it!
Yorihiko-san's group! It's your turn!
Leave it to us.
We've been gaming for 30
years! Don't underestimate us!
Even though we haven't been
playing as much lately...
Our skills haven't rusted a bit!
We did it!
Is that daddy's avatar?
I want that one too!
Papa's awesome!
Papa...
Bottom of the eighth, and Ueda
High is giving a stunning show!
Yumi-san...
Like a rat in a trap.
It's just a matter  of time now.
What's happening?
What's this?
Something's wrong with the stage!
What's going on?
Tasuke-san, behind you!
Behind you?
What?
Hot!
It's about to go critical!
Where'd all the ice go?
We had lots more than this...
Shouta-nii took it.
What?!
Is that cool enough, Grandma?
They say today's  the
hottest day of summer.
Top of the ninth, and Ueda's pitcher
Jinnouchi is  beginning to crack.
He looks very tired, doesn't he?
Ryouhei!
And Matsushou  continues
their offensive!
These are all the
avatars he's absorbed!
More than 400 million!
Kazuma-kun, run!
Kazuma-kun!
It's so hot that Grandma
might start to rot,
and here you guys  are playing games.
...all because of you...
Huh? What was that?
This is all your fault!
This is because you...!
Stop, Kazuma-kun!
What's the deal!
Are you okay, Shouta-nii?
Everything's gone to
hell since you showed up!
Natsuki getting all weird!
Grandma died!
Now Kazuma's hitting me!
Shouta-nii...
Wha, what's happening?
The world clock is...
going haywire.
What kind of countdown is this?
Why...
These are nuclear reactors.
This is bad.
The American military's secret
communication lines are going wild.
Japan's planetary probe Arawashi
is plummeting to Earth,
completely out of control.
Arawashi can change its
course through GPS coordinates.
If that thing is in
control  of Arawashi...!
Then this countdown is...
It's telling the time
until Arawashi falls
onto one of the world's
What an  exhilarating match!
The finals are going  into overtime!
The road to the nationals is
indeed fraught with peril!
The pressure on these high
schoolers must be incredible!
As you'll recall, Ueda's pitcher Jinnouchi
allowed 30 hits in yesterday's semi-finals.
Today, he must pitch 15
extended innings on his own.
Ryouhei!
Today, in the final match, will his
mind and body be up to the challenge?
This is...
Grandma's...
Wait, Natsuki!
Natsuki!
- Wait!
- Where are you going?
Everyone!
A game?
It's playing a game
with people's lives?
You...
You've got to be kidding me.
This is all just a  game to him.
It has no ideals,  no hatred.
The Americans are  frantic right now.
They never imagined
that their test could have
lead to this.
An object with a diameter of 1
meter falling at 7 km per second
packs the same force as a
meteor or ballistic missile.
If it falls on a power plant
and there's nuclear fallout,
the damage caused will be unimaginable.
Then what do we do?
It's managed to steal  38%
of the currently existing
King Kazma, kill that monster!
number of accounts  on OZ, 412 million!
We have to find the one among those
that can set Arawashi's GPS coordinates.
In 2 hours.
How're we going to find one
account among 400 million?!
But there's no other way.
Kazuma.
What's  going on?
You're just talking
about a game, right?
Right?
Don't go, King!
It's useless!
Shut up!
Grandma...
I'm sorry.
I couldn't save mom...
I couldn't save my little sister.
Wabisuke's the only one who
could do something now, but...
There's no way  he'd come back.
We haven't lost yet.
Kenji-kun.
We lost.
No we didn't.
I told you, we lost!
I'm telling you, we haven't.
There's got to be some other
way to solve this problem.
What do you mean?
This ain't math.
It's the same.
You can't solve an
equation by giving up.
We just haven't  found the answer yet.
You...
Natsuki!
How'd you find this  address, Natsuki?
Where are you right now?
What's it to you?
And how'd you find out
the password to my cell?
Come back!
Grandma told you to do this, didn't she.
Listen.
I'm not going back.
Not as long as she's  still there.
Please, listen to me.
I never would've gone back if
I'd known it was her birthday.
Ojisan!
Come now!
You don't even know  what's happened!
What's the matter.
Grandma  passed away.
She had a weak heart.
Mansaku-ojisan couldn't help her
in time because of OZ acting up.
Grandma's...
Grandma's dead?
You were lying when you said you
didn't know it was her birthday.
The password  was August 1st!
You came back for  her
birthday, didn't you?
Didn't you!
Please...
Come back just once
and bid her goodbye!
To my family:
First, I must ask you to calm down.
It's important for everyone
to compose themselves.
I want the funeral to
be a small, family affair,
and I wish for all of you to
go about your lives as normal.
I don't have anything material
to leave behind for you,
but the people I've come to
know over the course of my life
will do their best to help
you get along. Don't worry.
Everyone, work diligently and
live your lives to the fullest.
And...
And if Wabisuke  should ever come home,
though it's anyone's guess as to when he'll
come after having been gone for 10 years,
if he should ever come back
home, I'm sure he'll be hungry,
so feed him well with vegetables from
the fields, and the grapes and pears.
I can remember the  day I first met him.
His ears looked so much like his
father's that I was surprised.
As we walked along the fields,
when I told him, "You're going to
be part of my family from now on,"
he didn't reply, but
didn't  let go of my hand.
I felt as though my happiness
that he was now my son
was reaching him  through that.
Family should never
let go of one another.
You must never admit defeat in life.
And though you may come
upon hard and painful times,
I want you all to sit
together and eat as a family.
The worst things in this world
are being hungry  and being alone.
I was glad to  have had you all.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Ojisan!
Grandma! Grandma!
Wabisuke, pay your
respects to Grandmother.
And after that...
let's all have lunch together.
Ryouhei, you can do it!
Yumi-san, come!
But I'm still watching!
Grandma, I'm home.
It's going for a nuclear power plant?
That's horrible!
Yeah, this is an emergency.
Can we sit around and eat like this?
It was part of her will.
It's really strong, right?
In summer of 1615,
at the battle of Osaka,
we fought against Tokugawa's
vast army of 15,000.
But we lost!
We can't fight just because
it looks like we'll win
and run just because it
looks like we'll lose.
We've fought through
losing wars before.
Every time.
Our family was so stupid!
Right, and we're the
descendants of those people.
Yeah, and I'm one of  those idiots, eh.
Still, we've got some
kind of plan, right?
I'm going to try and
dismantle him remotely.
I don't know whether  or
not I'll have the time.
This all came about because
of the stolen accounts.
We've got another plan
that'll work in our favor.
Work in our favor?
You said he liked  playing games, right?
It's this.
You've got one hour left!
Welcome to the OZ Casino Stage.
Do you really want other
people's accounts so badly?
Fine. I'll give you mine.
But you have to win  against me first!
Hanafuda has been selected.
What will the wager be?
My wager will be...
my family!
We'll play with our
accounts  on the line!
All of your accounts  are in my hands.
Grandma, please watch over us!
Hanafuda, huh. Suits our family.
Wabisuke-san, I want you to work on
destroying it while they go at it.
But do you think he'll
agree to this match?
We only number 20 people,
including Sakuma-kun.
Isn't that a bit small of a wager?
Shut up!
Small or not,  these are our lives!
Bring it on!
Let's fight!
He'll come.
No doubt about it.
A player has joined the game.

Koi koi!
Natsuki-san, koi koi.
Koi koi?
Ribbon. Koi koi?

This is great.
He's completely new to this.

It's a boy living in Germany.
Who?
Is he a fan of Kazuma's?
I don't know.
Unbelievable.
This represents 13.837%
of OZ's total subscription!
More than 150 million  accounts!
Why're they...
It must be because  Natsuki's pretty.
What's with the light show?
OZ's guardian spirits have
given Natsuki a rare item.
I don't know what's going on, but...
Thank you!
Unknown-san raises  the bet.
He wants to end it.
Let the game begin.
Boar-Deer-Butterfly.

Do it!
Finish it, sempai!

It...
It...
stopped.
All right!
We did it!
Hooray!
Sempai!
Kenji-kun.
I...
I...
I did it!
Wha– Sempai!
Wait!
Something's wrong.
Huh?
The countdown  isn't stopping!
Huuuh!?
That makes no sense!
The world clocks everywhere
else  have already stopped.
Why only here?
He's going to drop  Arawashi here?
Looks like it!
Are you shitting me?!
Haven't you pulled that thing apart yet?
I'm trying!
It's too late to change
the thing's course now.
Everyone stay calm  and evacuate.
Tell the neighbors.
We don't know how bad
the damage will be.
Let's go!
Is our house gonna blow up?
We'd be lucky if it
ended with the house!
Grandma, what do we do with this?
Take it with you, of course!
Mother, the bankbook!
Natsuki!  Move it!
Natsuki!
Did he leave any logs
behind in the control sector?
Let me see!
Are you still trying to do something?
They said you can't change its course.
Riichi-san, you said that Arawashi's course
could be changed with GPS coordinates, right?
Yeah.
We can send its GPS false information
just like he did yesterday!
It's here.
You can see its  footprints!
If you induce an error  in
the landing information...
You might be able  to
change its course a bit!
But I don't know if it'll work
or not, so everyone get clear.
Kenji-kun.
Hurry, you all!
Hurry!
We haven't lost yet!
What happened here?
This is it!
Why...?
The password's been changed.
He's trying to stop you!
That can't be...
Calm down!  We're right here with ya!
You can do it.
Do it!
Okay!
Do your best!
Okay!
It's open!
That was fast.
We're locked out!
Damn it!
Once more!
Kazuma!
I lowered his defense  stats to zero!
Blow him to bits!
Off you go!
Master!
It's open!
Not again!
He's doing the calculations in his head?
Stop getting in the waaaay!
Please let this work!
It's a hot spring!
A hot spring!
A hot spring appeared!
Ueda High pulls  off
a miraculous comeback!
Advancing to the nationals
for the first time in 24 years,
After a grueling 15 overtime innings,
the mound is swarmed
with victorious players!
Shouts of joy are  filling the stadium!
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday, dear Grandma.
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday!
Natsuki!
Come on, don't cry, Ryouhei.
It moved! That's weird!
She's saying, "Thank you."
Dad!
You did good.
I saw Wabisuke-san on the news.
He came forward  by himself, didn't he?
However, the professor only
designed the A.I. Love Machine,
and the American military is
responsible for turning it loose.
Though thankfully there
were no casualties,
it is clear that the organizations
responsible for this incident
will have to take
responsibility for their actions.
Ah, right. Tell Kenji
he doesn't have to
come back for a while.
He says you don't have to come back.
No, but I have to.
How about you two marry for real?
But you have to start
dating first, right?
What do you think?
If you say you  like her, I'll kill you!
Do you hate Natsuki?
I'll kill you if you  say that, too!
I-I love her!
You bastard!
I'm glad.
Thank you.
Kiss, kiss!
Hey, you!
I'll arrest ya!
My nose!
What a wimp!
