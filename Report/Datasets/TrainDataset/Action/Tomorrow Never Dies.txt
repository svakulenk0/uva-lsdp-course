MAN: Our man's in position
on the center camera.
Chinese Long March Scud,
Panther AS-565 attack helicopter,
a pair of Russian mortars,
and the crates look like American rifles.
Chilean mines, German explosives.
Fun for the whole family.
- White Knight, show us the pawns.
- You see, he did get through, Admiral.
- Start with that chap in the middle.
- Load the ID program.
- Database ID search.
- Checking the databases.
We've got our first match: Satoshi lsagura.
Wanted for the Tokyo subway attack.
Currently working for
the insurgent force in Zaire.
Henry Gupta. American.
Practically invented techno-terrorism.
Started out as a student radical
at Berkeley in the '60s.
- Zoom in on that, can you?
- Looks like an American encoder.
They use it to control navigation
satellites - the GPS system.
I wonder, will the CIA be more upset
that they lost it or that we found it'?
- Excuse me. Admiral?
- Thank you, M. We've seen enough.
You saw the Gatling gun? Are your troops
prepared for that kind of fire power?
The president said
any loss of life is unacceptable.
We'll take the naval option. One strike,
we take out half the world's terrorists.
- Admiral Roebuck, I must protest.
- Get me the Chester.
- Let's not waste time.
- My man isn't finished.
Black King to White Bishop.
Authorization to fire.
Time to target:
four minutes eight seconds.
White Knight, four minutes to impact.
Get out of there.
Yes, I know what it is. It's on the screen in
front of me. It's a Jeep in front of a plane.
- Now get the hell out of there.
- What the hell's going on?
- You will not wait. That's an order.
- What is your man waiting for?
- If the cruise hits them...
- Order them to abort the missile.
- Abort missile.
- Abort missile.
Captain, missile out of range.
Unable to destroy.
- White Knight...
- Alert NATO, the Pentagon.
- Will it trigger the torpedoes?
- It might, but even if it does not,
there's enough plutonium
to make Chernobyl look like picnic.
Bloody hell. Can't you people
keep anything locked up?
Evacuate your troops
and get him out of there now.
White Knight, come in.
White Knight, come in.
- Keep trying, damn it.
- White Knight, come in.
- What the hell is he doing?
- His job.
Ask the admiral where
he'd like his bombs delivered.

Until you say

PA: The ship has been over flown
by two Chinese MiGs.
We believe they have hostile intent.
Hands to action stations.
Officer of the Watch, maximum speed.
Come left 40 degrees.
Sir, the Chinese pilot insists that
we are only eleven miles off their coast
and he will fire if we don't turn around
and go to a Chinese port.
Send this: "We are in international waters
and will defend ourselves if attacked."
Shut down the engines.
Maintain full silence.
A Stealth ship may be invisible to radar,
but the sea drill isn't.
The British will think
it's a Chinese aerial torpedo.
Stamper to Hamburg.
Phase one is in progress.
- The MiGs are making another pass.
- Let's start the show.
There's been no sonar contact, sir.
The MiGs must have dropped it.
- Target 1200.
- Knock, knock.
Now they're wondering
why it hasn't exploded.
- Switch to alternate supply.
- Three generators are down, sir.
- Flooding on foredeck aft.
- We're down 14 degrees by the stern.
Yeoman, send to admiralty: "Have been
torpedoed by Chinese MiGs. Sinking."
Mr. Gupta's little trick
with the encoder worked.
They gave their final position
Mr. Stamper.
I'm having fun with my headlines.
I need to know
the exact number of survivors.
I'm late for a meeting. Make sure
you use the right kind of ammunition.
Start the recovery operation.
Send our divers down to the Devonshire.
What havoc shall the Carver Media Group
create in the world today?
Floods in Pakistan, riots in Paris
and a plane crash in California.
Excellent. Mr. Jones, are we ready
to release our new software?
Outstanding.
Mr. Wallace, call the president.
Tell him if he doesn't sign the bill
lowering the cable rates,
we'll release the video of him
with the cheerleader in the motel room.
- After he signs, release the tape anyway.
- Consider him slimed.
- He's on transponder seven.
- Mr. Stamper.
Phase two is under way.
I have the video tape.
I haven't seen it myself I
but I'm told the footage is excellent.
P/us there were 17 survivors
for your headlines.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
By a curious quirk of fate,
we have the perfect story
with which to launch
our satellite news network tonight.
It seems a small crisis is brewing
in the South China Seas.
I want full newspaper coverage,
I want magazine stories, I want books,
I want us on the air 24 hours a day.
This is our moment!
And a billion people around this planet
will watch it, hear it and read about it
- Just ignore it.
- Those are words...
- Bond here.
- MAN: Go to a secure line, 007.
- That ship was in international waters.
- We can't be certain.
I'm just up here at Oxford,
brushing up on a little Danish.
- We're sending the fleet to China.
- Uh-huh.
- I'll be there... in an hour.
- Make that 30 minutes.
- Don't ask.
- Don't tell.
That's preposterous.
We know exactly where that ship was.
The GPS system,
global positioning satellites do not lie.
Yes, but our Singapore station
picked up a mysterious signal
on the GPS frequency
at the time of the attack.
- It could have sent that ship off course.
- I have a missing frigate.
- I'm aware of that.
- We need decisive action.
My goal is to prevent
World War Ill, Admiral.
Sending an armada into the area
is not the best way to do it.
Where exactly did this
mysterious GPS signal come from?
- We're still investigating.
- Investigating!
Sometimes I don't think
you have the balls for this job.
Perhaps. The advantage is,
I don't have to think with them all the time.
It was an unprovoked attack
on a ship in international waters.
We send in the fleet for recovery
and prepare for full retaliation.
Moderation. We investigate and stop short
of sending the entire British navy
within ten minutes of
the world's largest air force.
- When will our ships be in position?
-48 hours.
Christ! The press are
already screaming for blood.
The last thing we want to do
is escalate the situation.
I'm afraid it may be too late
to worry about that.
"According to Vietnamese officials
who recovered the bodies,
"the victims were killed by the ammunition
used by the Chinese air force."
- Did you leak this?
- No.
- It's the first I've heard of it.
- Well, this settles it.
We send in the fleet.
M, you have 48 hours to investigate.
Our contact in Saigon said the Vietnamese
only found our sailors three hours ago.
Somebody at Tomorrow knew
before the Vietnamese did.
How much do you know
about Elliot Carver, 007?
Worldwide media baron. Able to topple
governments with a single broadcast.
I didn't tell the minister, but that signal
came from one of Carver's satellites.
The PM would have my head
if he knew you were investigating him.
I'm sending you to Hamburg,
to a party at Carver's media center.
Now he has the ability to reach
every human being on the earth.
Except the Chinese,
who've refused broadcast rights.
James, your ticket, cover story
and rental-car reservation.
I believe you once had a relationship
with Carver's wife, Paris.
That was a long time ago, M.
Before she was married.
- I didn't realize it was public knowledge.
- Queen and country, James.
Your job is to find out if Carver
or someone in his organization
Use your relationship
with Mrs. Carver, if necessary.
- I doubt if she'll remember me.
- Remind her.
You'll just have to decide
how much pumping is needed, James.
If only that were true
of you and I, Moneypenny.
PA: Security announcement. Passengers
must not leave baggage unattended.
- Guten Tag. Kann ich lhnen helfen?
- Ja. Mein Btiro hat ein Auto reserviert.
- Einen Moment, bitte.
- Dankeschén.
It's the insurance damage waiver
for your beautiful new car.
- Will you need collision coverage?
- Yes.
- Fire?
- Probably.
- Property destruction?
- Definitely.
- Personal injury?
- I hope not, but accidents do happen.
Well, that takes care
of the normal wear and tear.
Only from me, O07, unless you bring
that car back in pristine order. Shall we?
All the usual refinements - machine guns,
rockets and the GPS tracking system.
WOMAN: Please fasten seat belt
and obey all instructions for a safe trip.
Thought you'd pay more attention
to a female voice.
I'm not interested in your sordid escapades.
Let's get on with it, shall we?
So that's what I've been
doing wrong all these years.
It also includes a fingerprint scanner
and a 20,000-volt security system.
And this I am particularly proud of:
the remote control for your car.
Now, draw your finger
very slowly across the pad...
It's surprisingly difficult to drive,
but with practice...
Well, let's see how
she responds to my touch, eh, Q?
- I think we understand each other.
- Grow up, 007.
WOMAN: Attention. Engine running.
Please shut door now.
Anyway, there's absolutely
no truth in this malicious rumor
that I started running
mad-cow disease stories
simply because Sir Angus Black,
the great British beef baron,
lost £10,000 to me in a game
of poker and refused to pay up.
I took 100 million francs from the French
to keep the stories running for a year.
Excuse me, Mr. Carver.
This is the new banker, Mr...
Another new banker.
I seem to collect them.
Tell me, Mr. Bond, how is the market
reacting to the crisis?
Wai Lin. I'm from
the New China News Agency.
- I don't recall your name on the guest list.
- I have a confession.
- Why would you do that, my dear?
- I wanted to meet you.
Outstanding. I admire a woman
who takes the initiative.
- You should work in my Beijing bureau.
- Mr. Carver, you have no Beijing bureau.
{IT HAD TO BE YOU
BEING PLAYED ON PIANO}
I always wondered how I'd feel
if I ever saw you again.
- Something came up.
- Something always came up.
- And how are you, Paris?
- Much better now. We're even.
Mr. Bond will have a vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.
Mrs. Carver will have a tequila.
Straight shot.
No. Mrs. Carver will have a glass
of Mr. Carver's champagne.
- I see you've moved up in the world.
- And tonight you're a banker.
Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?
- To you.
- No. To the gun.
- I take it this isn't a social visit.
- Your husband may be in trouble.
"The Emperor of the air." If you think of
going after him, you're the one in trouble.
Perhaps, but it's either him
or someone in his organization.
I see. And you figured you could
charm the dirt out of me.
- No. That wasn't my plan.
- Good.
If it comes to a choice between
you and Elliot, I've made my bed.
I want you to meet Wai Lin,
New China News Agency.
- Hello, Mrs. Carver.
- It's a pleasure.
- And this is James Bond.
- I didn't realize you knew each other.
- We're old friends.
- Casual acquaintances.
I'm thinking of getting
Wai Lin behind a news desk.
That's wonderful.
I'm sure she won't resist too much.
I was just wondering about your satellites,
the way you positioned yourself globally.
They're merely tools
for information, Mr. Bond.
Say, if you wanted to manipulate
the course of governments. Or people.
- So, how do you really know him?
- I told you. He's a banker I met in Zurich.
Ladies and gentlemen,
meine Damen und Herren,
Mr. Can/er's broadcast will be starting
in ten minutes in the main studio.
Exactly what kind of banking
do you specialize in, Mr. Bond?
Carver must feel at home
in a room like this.
Looks like there's someone
who wants to talk to you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are live in five, four, three, two...
Good evening. Tonight's broadcast
was supposed to be a celebration
marking the completion of
the Carver Global Satellite Network.
But, as you're well aware, terrible conflict
looms tonight in the South China Sea,
which, unchecked, has the potential
to destroy every human being on earth.
I want to assure my viewers
that I, Elliot Carver..-
...have spoken with the prime minister
in London and the chairman in Beijing
and have offered my services
as an impartial..-
It's a soundproof room, Mr. Bond.
Nobody hears you scream.
Make him uncomfortable.
I'll be there in a few moments.
...with its printing presses
that run 24 hours a day
and its satellite facilities
linking every last...
You seem very concerned
about Mr. Carver's business.
The power to illuminate the far corners
of the globe, not for higher profits,
but for higher understanding
between the people of this great planet.
Put him in the chair.
Maybe we play a number on his head.
And what do I expect in return?
Worldwide domination.
Complete, utter, total
worldwide domination.
But not over governments
or religion or ideology.
Herr Stamper... Herr Stamper...
Herr Stamper!
...tonight I offer you
my declaration of principles,
a promise to the men
and women of this planet,
my brothers and sisters,
whom I so humbly serve
I promise to report the news
without fear or favor.
I promise to be a force
for good in this world.
Fighting injustice, crushing intolerance,
battling inhumanity...
-...striking a blow for freedom at every turn
- It's time for...
That is the goal
of the Carver Media Group Network.
- What's happening?
- We've lost power. We're off the air.
Meine Damen und Herren,
bleiben Sie ruhig.
Es gibt eine kleine Stdrung.
Wir machen gleich wetter.
Ladies and gentlemen, please stay calm.
There's no need to exit.
What do you mean, you don't know?
You're fired! Out of my sight!
scrappy media mogul Elliot Carver
was cut off the air tonight in mid-speech
during the inaugural broadcast
of his worldwide satellite network.
Come on, Elliot. Ignore those people.
Sometimes these things happen.
When I was 16, I went to work
for a newspaper in Hong Kong.
It was a rag, but the editor
taught me one important lesson.
The key to a great story
is not who or what or when,
Your friend, Mr. Bond
made a mess tonight.
- I want to know why.
- I told you, I barely know him.
You can tell him
you didn't get anything out of me.
Do you know I used to look in the papers
every day for your obituary?
- What did you find?
- I hacked into the mainframe at the bank.
Bond's got a perfect employment record.
He's crossed every T, he's dotted every I.
- Which means?
- Government agent.
I call it "Gupta's Law
of Creative Anomalies".
If it sounds too good
to be true, it always is.
There's a lot of garbage,
but if you dial down the ambient noise...
PARIS: Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?
Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?
I think we should set an appointment
for my wife with the doctor.
Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?
- I have to go.
- No, you don't.
I can get you out of
the country in four hours.
I have no choice. No one can
protect me from him. Not even you.
- You do have a choice.
- Only if you let him go.
He has a secret lab on the top floor.
There's an emergency hatch in the roof.
- You don't have to do this.
- It's the easiest way to get in.
I want two guards outside this office
-{KNOCKING}
- Nobody gets in. Got it?
Send this thing off to the launch site.
And be careful. It's worth $300 million.
- Looking for a news story?
-{MEN SHOUT}
I believe you've got
two items that belong to me.
Tell me if you find the encoder.
Call me immediately.
And in breaking news: it is with great
sadness that we announce the death
of Paris Carver, who has
become an international figure
since she became the wife of
Elliot Carver, chairman of this network.
According to police officials
in Hamburg, Germany,
in a hotel suite in that city
in unusual circumstances.
- Police refused to elaborate.
-{BOND GROANS}
- A coroner has been called for.
- Paris.
...to deliver his full report
within the next three days.
Her body was discovered along with
the body of an unidentified man,
who appeared to be the victim
of a self-inflicted gun wound...
Good. Now, lie down on the bed
next to Mrs. Carver.
- Tomorrow's news today.
- Just so.
I am an outstanding pistol marksman.
Take my word for it, ja?
It won't look like a suicide
if you shoot me from there.
Believe me, I could shoot you from
Stuttgart und still create the proper effect.
My art is in great demand, Mr. Bond.
I go all over the world.
I am especially good
at the celebrity overdose.
But now I am afraid, Mr. Bond,
that our little...
-{RADIO INTERFERENCE}
- Agh, Stamper!
You can't be serious.
Did you call the Auto Club?
Do you wanna call them?
Make him tell you how to open it.
This is very embarrassing.
It seems there is a red box in your car.
They can't get to it.
They want me to make you unlock the car.
- You have a doctorate in that, too?
- No, no.
This is more like a hobby.
But I am very gifted.
- My cellphone opens the car...
- No, no, Mr. Bond. I do it, ja?
WOMAN: Welcome.
Please fasten seat belt.
Driver alert. Obstruction ahead.
Reduce speed now.
Reminder: unsafe driving
will void warranty.
You know the world's my office.
Let's go this way.
- Did Q bring you up to speed?
- Yeah, I brought the GPS calibration unit.
By the way, you know that officially
Uncle Sam is neutral in this turkey shoot.
We have no interest in seeing
World War Ill - unless we start it.
Dr Greenwalt.
He's the air-force GPS expert.
but the GPS encoder is one of our
most closely guarded military secrets.
Jesus! It's the missing encoder.
How'd you get that?
Could somebody use this
to send a ship off course?
- You mean like the Devonshire?
- Nobody mentioned the word Devonshire.
Well, in theory,
if you could alter the timing chip,
- Like putting a magnet beside a compass.
- Yeah, exactly.
- Then check this out.
- Oh, yeah.
Those two circles should be
on top of each other.
If we knew the last position
the Devonshire thought she was,
could you figure out
exactly where she sank?
- Wade.
- Yeah?
The high-altitude, low-opening jump, the
HALO, is where we get the most fatalities.
You free-fall for five miles. And use
your oxygen or you'll die of asphyxiation.
Next, after the free fall, pop the chute
at 200 feet below the Chinese radar.
You'll be traveling over 200mph.
This snaps your head back.
- Don't crack your skull open on the tanks.
- I'll keep that in mind.
One last thing. When you hit the water,
cut away your chute.
got tangled up in their chutes
and drowned. Got it?
- Seems like a lot just to save the world.
- I've got no choice, Wade.
I have to prove
that ship was sent off course.
- One minute.
-ls the pick-up set?
You bet. After your mission, turn on your
beacon and we'll extract you after dark.
This is where the ship thought it was.
And this is where it really is.
But see that island there?
That means that where he's jumping,
between the British and Chinese fleets,
technically they're not Chinese waters.
- They belong to Vietnam.
- BOTH: Vietnam?
Does he have any US government
markings on him'?
If the Vietnamese catch him,
they're gonna go crazy.
WAI LIN: Still interested
in hostile takeovers?
It's the opportunities for travel
that I like best about banking.
If I didn't know better, I'd say
you were following me around, Mr. Bond.
You'll have to admit we seem to have
developed an attachment to each other.
If I didn't know better, I'd say
he'd developed an edifice complex.
- General Chang?
- Friend of yours?
- Welcome to Saigon.
- It's always nice to see you, Elliot.
I hadn't intended opening until tomorrow,
but as you're here,
I hope you extended
the same courtesy to Paris.
Actually, Mr. Bond, you're the one
who wrote my late wife's obituary
Still, let's see. "British secret service
agent James Bond and his collaborator
"Wai Lin, of the Chinese People's
External Security Force,
"were found dead
this morning in Vietnam."
It's old news, Elliot.
We've been working together for months.
Both our governments know what
you and General Chang are up to.
I don't think so. You may have seen
the general in the hallwayjust now,
but perhaps, with all yourjetting around,
you've not perused today's headlines.
I never believe what I read
in the press anyway.
You see, we're both men of action,
but your era and Miss Lin's is passing.
Words are the new weapons,
satellites the new artillery.
And you become the new
supreme allied commander?
Exactly. Caesar had his legions,
Napoleon had his armies,
By midnight I'll have reached
and influenced more people
than anyone in the history
of this planet, save God himself.
And the best he ever managed
was the Sermon on the Mount.
- You really are quite insane.
-{HELICOPTER APPROACHES}
The distance between insanity and genius
is measured only by success.
If you'll forgive me, your appearance here
has forced me to move up my timetable.
I'll leave you in the capable hands
of Mr. Stamper and his toys.
- Sir, the helicopter.
- Thanks, Gupta.
Mr. Stamper is a protégé
of the late Dr Kaufman,
who was schooling him
in the ancient art of chakra torture.
- He was like a father to me.
- Really? Interesting role model.
In Eastern philosophy,
the body has seven chakra points,
The purpose of these implements
is to probe those organs,
whilst keeping the victim alive
for as long as possible.
Dr Kaufman's record was 52 hours.
I'm hoping to break it.
I would have thought watching
your TV shows was torture enough.
Save this one till last.
When you remove Mr. Bond's heart,
there should just be enough time
for him to watch it stop beating.
- Get after them.
- Ready? Go.
- Get a car.
- No, no. A bike. A bike is quicker.
Keys. Someone always forgets them.
What are you doing? I'm driving. Get off.
-{WAI LIN GRUNTS}
- Get on the back.
- What are you...
- Give me that.
- Clutch. Clutch! Clutch!
- Turn right.
- No, left.
- Who's driving? Come on.
- How many back there?
- I can't see. Hold on.
- Don't get any ideas.
- I'd never dream of it.
- Go for the barrels.
- What?
- Hold on.
-{HONKING}
- Helicopter!
- All right, keep your shirt on.
- Get on the back.
- Are you trying to protect me?
No, I need to balance the bike.
Get on the back.
- WAI LIN: It's behind us.
- Move!
It comes from growing up
in a rough neighborhood.
- You were pretty good on the bike.
- Well...
- Work hand in hand?
- Stick closer to each other.
Copy of a Makarov 59.
Standard issue. Chinese army.
It depends whether your mission
is peace or revenge.
Last year we found Stealth material
was missing from one of Chang's bases.
I followed a lead
to Carver's HQ in Hamburg.
We thought he was
building a Stealth plane.
No. Stealth boat. That's the only way
they could get close to the Devonshire
Remember? They stole
a cruise missile from that ship.
He said he was moving
the timetable forward to midnight.
Under cover of darkness he'll position
the Stealth boat near the British fleet,
- And we will retaliate.
- And Carver will provide the pictures.
- I have to warn Beijing.
- No. Let's warn both our governments.
Get them talking.
It'll give us time to find where the boat is.
It's just like home. You get the equipment,
I'll send the messages.
- On second thoughts, you type.
- First we have to find the boat.
Of all the harbors and inlets
controlled by General Chang,
That leaves 14 where
he could hide a Stealth boat.
You can see it during the day.
It's invisible to radar but not the human eye.
So he'd have to hide it where he can sail
to the Devonshire and back in one night.
- This looks familiar.
- We've made some improvements.
- Have you, indeed?
- Okay, four hours out and four hours back.
Assume the boat is traveling
at a speed of 30 knots.
I've always been a fan
of Chinese technology.
According to this, there are four places
where he could harbor the boat.
Why don't you run a crosscheck
on those areas for anything suspicious?
The new Walther.
I asked Q to get me one of these.
Four missing boats, three
unexplained drownings. That has to be it.
He knows the island.
He says they all avoid it.
It's dangerous for boats
to be there at sunset.
But for 5,000 American dollars,
he'll take us.
but every now and then you get to sail
on a beautiful evening like this
and sometimes work with a decadent
agent of a corrupt Western power.
And they say Communists
don't know how to have fun.
I hate to disappoint you,
but I don't even have a little red book.
If anything happens to me,
the fuses for the mines are in here.
We're gonna finish this together.
And if I may say so,
you've found the right decadent,
corrupt Western agent as a partner.
- WAI LIN: See the Stealth?
- No.
It's getting late
and this is the last cove in the bay.
- Set the timers for ten minutes!
- Time to get out before the ship explodes.
Even if it doesn't sink,
it'll show up on radar.
- Our ﬂeets will finish the job.
- If they got our message.
- Up and over.
- Okay.
- We 're in position between the fleets.
- Fire one missile at each flagship.
The Chinese will think
the British are rattling the saber.
The British will think
the Chinese are being belligerent.
And the media will provide
cool, objective coverage.
- Missile lock-on.
- Send a signal to the admiralty.
Sir, AWACS reports two waves
of land-based MiG 21s inbound.
They should be
on our screens in two minutes.
How long before the MiGs are within
firing range of the British fleet?
-12 minutes.
- What the hell do I pay you for?
If she's there, Bond is there.
Stamper, find them.
If she blinks, kill her.
And you, come with me.
Delicious. Make sure you clear all
the mines, and bring the girl up to me.
It's my business, Mr. Gupta.
I like an audience.
Ah, Miss Lin. Your countrymen
are being so cooperative,
My government knows you're out here.
They're looking for you.
Not according to our radar,
where it seems your MiGs
are about to attack the British fleet in...
Gupta, how many minutes?
- Nine minutes to firing range.
- And even if they were looking for me,
or even your friend,
the late Commander Bond,
who is, I believe, at this moment on his
way to the bottom of the South China Sea.
A message from 007. Just confirmed
by my opposite number in China.
Tell the fleet to search for a ship that's
invisible... well, almost invisible to radar.
The Chinese aren't the enemy.
Carver's been playing both sides for fools.
Admiral, sir. Urgent message
from the admiralty.
Have you got anything on the radar that
looks very small? Lifeboat? Periscope?
- No, sir.
- A Stealth boat, sir? They have gone mad.
What you're about to witness, Miss Lin,
is not so much a missile attack
In precisely five minutes, after your
countrymen have attacked the British,
I shall retaliate for dear old England
by sending this missile into Beijing,
where General Chang has just
called an emergency meeting
arriving just after the missile
has killed your leaders
and too late to stop the air force
from sinking the entire British fleet.
But he will be just in time to take over
the government, negotiate a truce
and emerge as a world leader,
with the Nobel Peace Prize.
- And what do you get?
- Me?
Just exclusive broadcasting rights
in China for the next 100 years.
If you'll excuse me, my dear,
I have something of a deadline to meet.
I think I have something
that belongs to you.
So much for German efficiency.
Mr. Stamper.
- Don't shoot him yet.
- Hold your fire.
Even trade, Elliot. Gupta for Wai Lin.
You can't fire the missile without him.
And it seems you can't resist
any woman in my possession.
How romantic. Don't you realize
how absurd your position is?
No more absurd than
starting a war for ratings.
Great men have always manipulated
the media to save the world.
who told his photographers, "You provide
the pictures. I'll provide the war."
Sorry about that.
I tuned out there for a moment, Elliot.
Then it seems
you've outlived your contract.
He's breached the hull.
They'll see us on radar.
We have a small,
intermittent contact on the surface.
Very weak signal. Can't get the range,
but it wasn't there a second ago.
Yeoman, tell all ships: "Do not fire on
the Chinese for any reason whatsoever."
Send a message in the clear to the
Chinese: "Have sighted unknown ship..."
Mr. Stamper,
would you please kill those bastards?
- We must stop the boat.
- Can you take care of the engine room?
- Of course.
- Good. Then do it and get off the ship.
Admiral, sir. A signal from
the Chinese fleet commander.
"To Royal Navy task group. We also
have the unknown ship on our screens."
"We will not fire unless it turns
towards China. Good hunting."
Now, Captain, whatever the heli
that thing is, sink it.
Right, sir. PWO, is that echo
too weak for missile lock?
- Yes, sir.
- Right. We'll do it the old-fashioned way.
Prepare the missile
countdown immediately.
Initializing launch sequence:
T minus five minutes and counting.
They're making 48 knots. They'll be out of
our visual range within two minutes.
The engines are out.
We're sitting ducks here. Engine room.
Well done, PWO.
Officer watch, increase max.
Mr. Stamper,
what are you doing about the girl?
Perhaps you'd consider
looking in the engine room.
It's a bad habit of yours.
There's nothing you can do.
The missile's fully programmed.
It can't be stopped.
In a matter of minutes
my plan will succeed.
And thanks largely to your efforts,
the British navy will destroy the evidence.
And I'll be out of here - in a Carver
news helicopter covering the event-.
I may have some
breaking news for you, Elliot.
You forgot the first rule
of mass media, Elliot!
James, try the detonators.
The missile will set them off.
Never argue with a woman.
They're always right.
M, Bedford reports that Carver went down
with his ship. It seems that Bond made it.
Moneypenny, take this release: "Elliot
Carver is missing, presumed drowned,
"while on a cruise aboard his luxury yacht
in the South China Sea."
"At present, the local authorities believe
the media mogul committed suicide."
{THROUGH LOUDHAILER}
Commander Bond. Colonel Lin.
